Hello!<eos> Can I have everybody back to stage, please?<eos> Everyone come back to stage for selection.<eos> Okay. Thank you, Miss Crawly.<eos> You're welcome, Mr. Moon.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's see, now.<eos> I'll take...<eos> You guys.<eos> And which one of you is the girl?
I have this one because it belonged to my father.<eos> Every day for 30 years, he worked his tail off washing cars just so I could buy this place.<eos> Every day, Eddie.<eos> Just for me.<eos> Wow. Sounds like a great dad.<eos> So how do you wanna handle this?<eos> Uh, Mr. Moon, I got Judith from the bank holding on line two again.<eos> Well, there's only one thing I can do.<eos> Okay, everybody, listen up!<eos> I gotta send you all home.
Not for that singing contest I saw on the news.<eos> That's the one!<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> You don't have the money, do you?<eos> Well, we don't quite have it all locked in...<eos> Well, you'll not get a cent out of me.<eos> Nana, please just listen to me...<eos> No, absolutely not.<eos> Don't listen to him, Nana.<eos> I'm not listening to either of you.
Don't listen to him, Nana.<eos> I'm not listening to either of you.<eos> Lapsang souchong. No sugar.<eos> And be quick about it.<eos> Uh, Nana... I don't know how to make tea.<eos> Wow.<eos> I saw this show when I was a kid.<eos> Nana, you were absolutely amazing.<eos> Please, this flattery is futile.<eos> I have no intention of bailing you out.
I can recall the ushers in their velvet suits.<eos> Queues a mile long just to get a ticket.<eos> The curtain rising over that glorious stage.<eos> Music and light bringing dreams to life?<eos> Precisely.<eos> Well, it's just like you remember it.<eos> In fact, I've made it even more spectacular.<eos> No, you haven't. Shh.<eos> Come see for yourself.<eos> A special performance just for you.
The very first stage lit entirely by squid power!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Beautiful work, guys.<eos> Now, just follow me on the beat.<eos> And as you can see, this is no ordinary theater.<eos> This is a palace of wonder and magic.<eos> He's done it! He's really done it, Nana!<eos> Oh! Goodness!<eos> Now, welcome our first contestant.<eos> Which one of you is Moon?
Dear Ruth, this is all I can send you this month.<eos> Our books cost much more than you'd think.<eos> But I got a job at a service station that's good for a few bucks a week.<eos> Our coach has his own ideas about how to get things done.<eos> He's working us pretty hard.<eos> Now, you probably won't believe this, but guess what I did today?<eos> I applied for a marriage license.<eos> I'm coming back for you in style, Minnie Ruth.<eos> Kiss Gloria for me.<eos> I miss you both so much.
We hope to present a favorable image of ourselves, that's all.<eos> Well, then, let me ask you something.<eos> Do you want to be remembered as the guys who held the Olympics without America?<eos> The minister hopes you are impressed by the facilities here at our sports club.<eos> Yeah, the facilities are great.<eos> No problem with the facilities.<eos> But the one thing that puzzles me is you don't allow Jews to be members,<eos> and that's the only way they can qualify for the games.<eos> We have several, very promising Jewish athletes we expect to compete.<eos> Look, I'm not here to tell you how to run your country.
Hey, look at me!<eos> Coach Snyder.<eos> A lot of people show up for the Big Ten meet.<eos> Not all of them are gonna be on our side, you understand?<eos> Do you? Do you?<eos> You gotta learn to block it all out!<eos> It's just noise! That's all, all this is!<eos> All it is, is noise.<eos> You hear me?<eos> They will love you or they will hate you. Does not matter.
No, you run with an injured back, you could be out for months.<eos> All right? Forget it.<eos> Coach, let me do this.<eos> The three days did the trick.<eos> I'm good.<eos> It'll only be 10 seconds.<eos> Better be faster than that.<eos> Go. Ladies and gentlemen... The first sprint final of the day, the 100-yard dash!<eos> Negro!<eos> They will love you or they will hate you. Does not matter.
Yeah, well, you know what they say about records, don't you?<eos> No. What do they say?<eos> Some kid, come out of nowhere, snatch the record off of you, just like that.<eos> Oh, that saying.<eos> Yeah. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.<eos> No, you did good.<eos> Real good, Jesse.<eos> That was something to watch.<eos> Yeah, well, I'll tell you what.<eos> You stick with me, I'll make a great coach out of you.
He's a driver, not a floater like you.<eos> It's ugly to watch, but he goes down that track like a freight train on fire, and he's got a hell of a finish.<eos> Him, you need to watch out for.<eos> He clocked at 9.5 against Villanova.<eos> There you go.<eos> He's slower. A tenth of a second slower, Jesse.<eos> Two-tenths, Coach.<eos> Mmm-hmm.<eos> Relax.<eos> I won't let you down in front of Cromwell.
Ihaven%thought aboutthatyet but I'll find a place, I swear.<eos> It's just us, Ruth.<eos> It's always been just us.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll marry you.<eos> Where you going?<eos> I gotta go find a guy to do it.<eos> I'll see you later!<eos> Gentlemen, today we make a profound decision.<eos> It is a complicated decision. For all of you, I know.
What matters is you were there.<eos> "AVERY". When it's all over, everybody goes home.<eos> History remembers the winners.<eos> Every man or woman on that field is grateful for the chance to be there, to meet in the spirit of friendly competition, man against man, nation against nation, to test themselves without fear or rancor against the best the other side has to offer.<eos> Surely we all agree the Olympic code is a direct antithesis to Nazi ideology.<eos> They're who we ought to be thinking about. Our athletes, those putting their sweat, their blood, their heart into getting that chance.<eos> I don't feel I have the right to take it away from them.<eos> I know when I was competing, I wouldn't have wanted it taken from me.<eos> And whether they bring home medals or not, they'll all have won that chance.<eos> I urge you to vote today not with your hearts as sporting men. To tell their children... but with your conscience... and their children's children... as members of the human race.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.<eos> Oh, well, hello.<eos> This is my wife, Ruth.<eos> Hello.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Our secretary, Mr. Walter White, has asked me to deliver this to you personally<eos> with his best wishes.<eos> All right.<eos> What's this about?<eos> I want to congratulate you on your many recent successes.
You listen to your heart, all right?<eos> Okay?<eos> Ruth, I have everything, all right?<eos> I'm sure.<eos> Now, I'm always saying goodbye to you.<eos> Yeah, well, thatjust makes it that much sweeter saying hello.<eos> Now, here you go, sweet talker.<eos> So you remember where to keep looking.<eos> Give Daddy a hug!<eos> I love you both.
Look, if we can get a pass for Mr. Snyder here, we can put all of this behind us.<eos> Hey, Jesse?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You better keep your boy on a leash.<eos> Dean.<eos> What the hell was that all about?<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> I figured you couldn't afford a decent seat.<eos> I thought I'd help you out.
Go ahead.<eos> Take a look.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> You sure?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Last chance.<eos> Bring it to me.<eos> What...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Mr. Owens, my name is Leni Riefenstahl. Um... I have a favor to ask you.
Hey.<eos> Hey!<eos> Our drugs are locked up now.<eos> Go out the way you came. Ain't nobody got to know about this.<eos> Charlie you need help?<eos> Want me to call you somebody?<eos> Ma'am?<eos> - Why won't you..<eos> - Ma'am.<eos> Ma'am, now, there's a Van outside. I'll get you anywhere you need to go if you're in trouble.
Alright.<eos> Alright, now.<eos> What's you name?<eos> You can tell me.<eos> It's alright, it's okay.<eos> - Doris.<eos> - Doris?<eos> Doris, I'm, I'm Mohamed.<eos> - We drove here? - That's right, we drove here.<eos> I didn't know if you was in trouble somebody's after you, but I, I just wanted to help you.

They almost became kind of friends, you know?<eos> And brothers started passin' him pages from the holy book. Tellin' him he didn't have to fight anymore.<eos> To surrender to the one and only.<eos> And just like that.. Cyclops was slain. Made a peaceful warrior by Allah.<eos> To friends.<eos> Old and new.<eos> It's a day's drive to the safe house.<eos> Tried to make it comfy for you back there, but it'll get bumpy.<eos> Shotgun in the back, if we hit any trouble.<eos> When you cross, these guys will take you to my connection.

You gotta know who you are, as an artist.<eos> I mean, that's what they're, they're voting' on when, when America looks at 'em.<eos> They wanna know who that singer is. Where he or she's been.<eos> I wanna look into that person's eye and go "i know your story."<eos> I can relate. That's true.<eos> I mean, it's as simple as that.<eos> It's the difference between a winner and a loser. Honesty.<eos> We reserved the honeymoon suite for you all. Here's the deal.<eos> Just in case osama didn't lay it out for ya you're gonna stay with us tonight.<eos> And tomorrow we are gonna load you into the back of a truck that is headed to juarez.

Hi.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Great, you speak English.<eos> Um, I'm running low on first aid.<eos> I'm staying on a boat.<eos> Sure.<eos> This is all I have.<eos> Thanks.<eos> If I don't have what you need, I can call our supply boat.<eos> They can take you back to Phuket to get it.
No, Brendan, it doesn't.<eos> It means "act manly."<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Get out of the bleedin' way.<eos> Morning, Brother Baxter.<eos> Sit down.<eos> - French, Brother Barnabas. - Huh?<eos> You're teaching French, not Latin.<eos> Oh, how modern.<eos> Mind you, I'd be surprised if any of you knew where France is, not to mind speaking the language.
Yeah, I'm not wearing any makeup.<eos> Relax, you're not even in the band.<eos> Yeah, thank God.<eos> I'm in the band, and I will not be wearing any makeup. Thank you.<eos> Why?<eos> You've got great lips.<eos> No, piss off.<eos> I'm not wearing makeup.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Those of you who actually care about the band and want to do this half properly, queue over there.
I can't afford to live here on my own.<eos> So you're getting a divorce?<eos> Can't get divorced in Ireland, so we'll be legally separated.<eos> I'm gonna be getting an apartment, and you three will live between there and... there.<eos> I'm not gonna be staying at Tony's.<eos> Let's get that crystal clear.<eos> I'd rather sleep on the street.<eos> I understand this is upsetting for you, Brendan.<eos> You don't understand anything!<eos> For all of you.
Eat a fart!<eos> Hello!<eos> Fu...<eos> Listen up.<eos> Iraq Two is happening.<eos> The network is stretched thin.<eos> All our talent is going there.<eos> We need people, any people, to fill the void in Afghanistan.<eos> And you folks here are all the unmarried, childless personnel in this bureau.<eos> For those of you who are behind the scenes, there are opportunities to be on camera.
It's unfortunate.<eos> Kim, this is Tall Brian.<eos> Brian Hooper.<eos> Tall Brian.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - I'm your shooter.<eos> So, is there another Brian around here somewhere that you're taller than?<eos> Short Brian.<eos> Works for Reuters.<eos> Couldn't one of you just be "Brian"?
Afghanis is the currency.<eos> That's right.<eos> I knew that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What do you believe your mission to be here?<eos> Ma'am, you got a sticker on your pants.<eos> It's bugging the shit out of me.<eos> Ma'am...<eos> Fahim.<eos> What inspired you to enlist originally?
Not on my vehicle.<eos> The girl at the North Face store said it was, like, military grade.<eos> Well, where are you gonna hide it?<eos> Inside a fucking sunset?<eos> I mean, even the Dutch Army don't wear orange.<eos> Fix it.<eos> How do I fix it?<eos> Rapono!<eos> Got to stay hydrated, ma'am.<eos> Coughlin. I didn't recognize you.
Kim.<eos> Get back in the car!<eos> No, please, Kim!<eos> Ma'am, I asked you to stay put!<eos> Those assholes tried to shoot us!<eos> Jesus!<eos> You have got to be shitting me!<eos> You just shot a Javelin at a fucking car!<eos> That's an $80,000 piece of ordnance!<eos> Can any of you geniuses tell me the Kelley Blue Book value of a 1989 Toyota pickup?
But what?<eos> Following a fatal traffic accident involving a coalition truck, long simmering frustration today boiled over into violence and despair.<eos> They kill us!<eos> They kill us and they break our hearts!<eos> And I also give this message to President Hamid Karzai:<eos> What the hell is happening here?<eos> Okay, I don't care who the hell's in there.<eos> I'm Kim Baker.<eos> Go on in, Kim.<eos> Jerry's expecting you.
Okay, I don't care who the hell's in there.<eos> I'm Kim Baker.<eos> Go on in, Kim.<eos> Jerry's expecting you.<eos> Well, that's fucking unsatisfying.<eos> - Can I take your bag?<eos> - Yes. Please.<eos> - Would you care for some water?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I should've Googled you.
You know, I miss it.<eos> The Stan.<eos> Yeah, I miss it, too.<eos> Actually, I tried to go back but even the Army wouldn't take me.<eos> I mean, the Army!<eos> I mean, that's just hurtful.<eos> Well, I'm very sorry for what happened to you.<eos> So if there's anything that you want to say to me, that's why I'm here.<eos> That's why I came here.<eos> Ma'am, I lost my legs because of an IED, not because of you.
I mean, that's just hurtful.<eos> Well, I'm very sorry for what happened to you.<eos> So if there's anything that you want to say to me, that's why I'm here.<eos> That's why I came here.<eos> Ma'am, I lost my legs because of an IED, not because of you.<eos> I appreciate that, but if I hadn't quoted you, you wouldn't have been transferred.<eos> No, really, you can say whatever you want to me.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> Okay, well, then let's say you're right.<eos> It's still not 'cause of you, ma'am.
What will happen if they arrest you?<eos> Will they take us away from you?<eos> That's a possibility.<eos> Hey.<eos> Wake up.<eos> Wake up, grizzly bear, my fantastic man.<eos> What we're doing out here is so incredible.<eos> The kids are amazing.<eos> But you have to take care of them for me, okay?<eos> I love you all so much.
Stay calm.<eos> Remember your training.<eos> Morning.<eos> How you doing today?<eos> Morning, officer.<eos> Can I see your license and registration, please?<eos> Certainly.<eos> - Nice rig.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I pulled you over because your back left taillight is out.
Just be easy.<eos> Follow through.<eos> Okay, get your things.<eos> Just a minute, please. Come on, Rell.<eos> I said "just a minute."<eos> I've clearly upset you, and I apologize.<eos> I heard you.<eos> I heard you fighting about where we live.<eos> Mom wanted to leave.<eos> I heard. Your mother and I made certain decisions, together, about what was best for all of you.
I just wish you'd helped mom.<eos> Me too.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - I love ya.<eos> - We want to complete the mission.<eos> There is no mission. -Mission:<eos> Rescue dad and mommy.<eos> Mom wanted to be cremated.<eos> And we want to honor her wishes. And flush her down the toilet.<eos> I can't put any of you in danger ever again.
Mommy's in here.<eos> Hi, little bird.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't know what to do.<eos> I'm sorry if I made it worse.<eos> My face is mine, my hands are mine, my mouth is mine,<eos> but I'm not.<eos> I'm yours.<eos> Mom, here's your favorite song.<eos> Bye, mommy!<eos> I love you all, okay? We love you.
As far as you're concerned, you don't know anything, you didn't see anything.<eos> I want you just to play dumb.<eos> It was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example.<eos> What?<eos> Oh.<eos> Hi.<eos> Okay, hey there, I got-- I'm sorry, I got to go now.<eos> Penny, wait.<eos> Why?<eos> I wanted to thank you for going through all the trouble of planning a second wedding ceremony for me, but unfortunately I cannot attend.
Okay, hey there, I got-- I'm sorry, I got to go now.<eos> Penny, wait.<eos> Why?<eos> I wanted to thank you for going through all the trouble of planning a second wedding ceremony for me, but unfortunately I cannot attend.<eos> Well, why?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Wha-- are we still doing the dumb thing?<eos> Okay, why, what's wrong?<eos> I just cannot stay here while your father goes out of his way to humiliate me.<eos> Oh, golly, however did he humiliate you?
Do you know where I can find him?<eos> May I ask what this is about?<eos> No, you may not.<eos> Very well.<eos> Have him call me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Raj, who's at the door?<eos> That's not him.<eos> Oh, I can't wait for you to meet everyone.<eos> I told them all about you.
Val, I...<eos> You're welcome.<eos> And I put some cereal in the kitchen and milk in the fridge.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> Say you're gonna stay in the program and you won't miss our next meeting.<eos> I promise.<eos> I promise you.<eos> Cross my heart, hope to die.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll see you out.
You know the rules.<eos> You're causing an obstruction.<eos> I'm just trying to make a living here.<eos> I'm not in anyone's way.<eos> It's an health and safety issue.<eos> If you stand there, you're obstructing the exit.<eos> Well, if you stand there, you are.<eos> - One toot on this, they'll haul you away.<eos> - Right.<eos> - If it was up to me, I'd arrest the lot of you.
But that's all.<eos> I don't want you to see me like that.<eos> And I've got Bob.<eos> He'll look after me.<eos> Bob!<eos> He'! -<eos> Hey, mister.<eos> I'm proud of you, James.<eos> So, what are you gonna do now?<eos> Well, first thing I'm gonna try and find a way to thank you.
# And I whisper your name #<eos> # I... I whisper your name #<eos> Hey, wow.<eos> Fuck, what did she say her name was?<eos> # As I whisper your name #<eos> Hey, Reggie?<eos> I was thinking...<eos> Sweet dreams.<eos> You!<eos> I didn't notice you there.
Hey, Reggie?<eos> I was thinking...<eos> Sweet dreams.<eos> You!<eos> I didn't notice you there.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> Name's Jebediah... been here such a long time.<eos> And what is your name, kind sir?<eos> Reggie.<eos> What brings you to this... God-forsaken place, Reggie?
The year is 1979.<eos> The funeral home where first we met.<eos> You called it Morningside.<eos> In three days, your younger self will attend a funeral here... and events will be set in motion.<eos> Right, yeah.<eos> You've tried to thrust yourself in my way for years now, but what has it got you?<eos> You loved ones, all gone.<eos> You slaughtered my family.<eos> You... they're all dead!<eos> None of you ever listen.
He figures out all my passwords.<eos> Which is kind of sexy.<eos> So, when I came home last night,<eos> Scott was on my laptop, wondering why...<eos> Scott's behavior is not normal.<eos> It's a form of emotional abuse.<eos> Are you ever afraid of Scott?<eos> It's not abuse.<eos> Not if you don't care, and I don't.<eos> Maybe it's become a normal state for you.

I can feel how cold she was.<eos> Forgive yourself.<eos> You don't have to be afraid of being alone.<eos> You're not alone.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> You and your baby will be fine.<eos> Why are you following me?<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I could ask you the same question.<eos> I saw you...

Lady, I live here.<eos> I'm always in that tunnel.<eos> But what did you see?<eos> What happened that night?<eos> What did you see?<eos> All right.<eos> You, uh...<eos> You busted your ass.<eos> You fell.<eos> I felt sorry for you. I tried to help you up.
You think I don't remember.<eos> You thought I blacked out.<eos> I saw you.<eos> Why did Megan get in your car?<eos> Did Megan get in your car?<eos> No!<eos> Yes, she did!<eos> Tell her the truth.<eos> Just tell her the truth right now.<eos> You attacked me in that tunnel because I saw her with you!
I thought you should know.<eos> You thought I should know?<eos> There's a chance it could be yours.<eos> Then get an abortion.<eos> Or if it's Scott's, do whatever you want, but if it's not, then get rid of it.<eos> You can be as involved as you want.<eos> You're a shitty nanny.<eos> What makes you think you're gonna be a good mother?<eos> Why did you bring me there in the first place?<eos> Becauselthought it would be fun to have you both around.
Look for the hummingbird.<eos> Friends, colleagues and those who thought he was a ﬁgment of my imagination may I introduce, all the way from Paris... and completely out of the blue... my wonderful, wonderful husband!<eos> I thought he was stuck in France forever!<eos> So it is true.<eos> You do exist!<eos> Oh, Maurice, how long do we have?<eos> The company gave me six weeks leave.<eos> Six weeks?<eos> That is a lifetime!<eos> You know, Christine never stops talking about you.
There.<eos> We had our first fight.<eos> Now we're okay again, yes?<eos> Marianne, we both know people who've fucked each other.<eos> Wow, that's a lot of fucks.<eos> Fasten your goddamn buttons.<eos> Actually, Max, the mistake people make in these situations isn't fucking.<eos> It's feeling.<eos> Have you been waiting long?<eos> Herr Hobar will see you now.
Max, you appear to be walking on air.<eos> It's revolting!<eos> - Good morning, sir.<eos> - Morning.<eos> They said Frank wanted to see me?<eos> Yes, straight away.<eos> Max, please remember you're in the land of "Yes, sir, no, sir."<eos> Don't throw anything or hit anyone.<eos> Got it.<eos> He's ready to see you.
There's 50 cases of the good stuff stashed in the diplomatic hangar.<eos> They won't miss a few.<eos> Why not just go to the shop?<eos> Nothing but the best for your intellectuals.<eos> I'll meet you at the pub after and we'll pick up the beer.<eos> Of course.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Max.<eos> What the hell brings you here?<eos> I just dropped by to invite you both to a party tonight.
Wait here.<eos> It's over, Max!<eos> The blue-dye came back positive. But you already know that, don't you?<eos> Frank, wait!<eos> Wait!<eos> Let me explain.<eos> - The circuit's been cleaned.<eos> - Max Vatan, in the name of His Majesty King George VI...<eos> They had her boxed in, Frank!<eos> I charge you with high treason...
Who is it?<eos> It's a bloody woman.<eos> No!<eos> Please!<eos> Lady Sansa, I offer my services once again.<eos> I will shield your back and keep your counsel and give my life for yours if need be.<eos> I swear it by the old gods and the new.<eos> And I vow... that you shall always have a place by my hearth and... Meat and mead at my table.<eos> ...meat and mead at my table.<eos> And I pledge to ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor.
- Confess.<eos> - Please.<eos> How is he?<eos> At least tell me that.<eos> Confess.<eos> I am the queen and I demand to see my brother.<eos> Sinners don't make demands.<eos> They make confessions.<eos> Septa Unella.<eos> Our other guests need you.
Can your team prep by 1:00?<eos> It'll be tight. It's lunchtime.<eos> There's lots of exits.<eos> We can expect heavy foot traffic.<eos> We'll have snipers cover the exterior.<eos> Snipers?<eos> We don't need snipers.<eos> I've got the cash.<eos> Let's do this civilly and quietly.<eos> I'm right behind you.
Get the crash cart! Go. Go.<eos> I'll get the bags!<eos> Come on. Don't die on me. Come on.<eos> Oh. God... Don't die on me now.<eos> Can I help you with something?<eos> Next time, you should phone me before you come here.<eos> Article 7-14 of the standard practice of Code of Ethics says we may not talk off the record.<eos> All right, here's what's gonna go down.<eos> We're gonna settle.<eos> I'm gonna give you everything that I got, all the evidence that we got against you, legal, illegal.
We're gonna settle.<eos> I'm gonna give you everything that I got, all the evidence that we got against you, legal, illegal.<eos> And the manner in which you were able to cover up all the shit that you've done.<eos> I'd love to help you but there's just one small problem.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What's that?<eos> I don't have the faintest fucking clue what you're talking about.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Emily was gonna extort you and you found out and you got your feelings hurt, so you killed her and then you framed me for it.
It's so funny.<eos> Emily kidnapped herself, didn't she?<eos> Of course.<eos> I mean, in retrospect, it makes total sense, doesn't it?<eos> Of course, when you love someone, you tend to overlook the obvious, but that's it.<eos> Poor old Emily.<eos> She was testing me to see if I would bring the money for her.<eos> But she didn't live long enough to see what I would do.<eos> Pity.<eos> Kind of sad that she involved you, too.
Yeah, everything's fine, Susie, just fine.<eos> No. Thank you for inquiring, honey.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Let me know if you need me.<eos> - I sure will.<eos> Keep your eye on us, too.<eos> I Will.<eos> You...<eos> You've looked better.<eos> I should fucking put you in the ground.
Oh, boy, you got evidence against you, son.<eos> Direct, circumstantial.<eos> It's all over the place, son.<eos> It's just not in your favor.<eos> Oh, I forget, the motive, too.<eos> Why did you do it?<eos> Why did you do this to me?<eos> What? Do what?<eos> I didn't do anything to you.<eos> I killed somebody because of you.
Be my guest.<eos> I didn't kill Emily.<eos> Any good lawyer will tell you it doesn't matter what is. It's what "is" looks like.<eos> There was a biker, a man on a motorcycle, who tried to bury me underneath a church.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Anyway, I snapped his neck.<eos> You know him?<eos> I've never heard of him, no.<eos> No, I think you do because you hired him.<eos> Unfortunately for you, this guy also kept a very detailed expense report on his laptop, just like an accountant.
Those. wind turbines are killing machines!<eos> The whole place is just feathers and decapitated puffin!<eos> I'll show you round, if you like.<eos> Who was that man?<eos> - What happened?<eos> Why was he so angry with you? - Hey... Leanne... you want to have some fun?<eos> Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Lerwick.<eos> The time is now seven o'clock in the morning.<eos> On behalf of NorthLink Ferries,<eos> I'd like to thank you for joining us on this trip and we're looking forward to seeing you on board again soon.
- Jimmy.<eos> - How are you doing, Paul?<eos> It'll have to be confirmed, but everything we're seeing points to MDMA.<eos> I... collected him from school.<eos> He played in the garden and then on the beach.<eos> They're saying it's ecstasy.<eos> Was he playing on his own?<eos> Yeah, yeah, he knows not to go in the water.<eos> Well, what about school?<eos> Where does Callum wait for you?
So... you're not going to take your man up on his offer of a date, then?<eos> What date?<eos> There was no date.<eos> Exhibition opening... that is a date.<eos> That's a classy date.<eos> What, as opposed to your idea of a date, which is to wait for someone's husband to get two years for fraud and then ask them out?<eos> Jenny chucked him out before he was even charged and you know it.<eos> Sandy Wilson, master of the long game.<eos> Yeah... That was a date, though.<eos> So, who told you about the driftwood rule?
Yeah... That was a date, though.<eos> So, who told you about the driftwood rule?<eos> At the board where I'm staying.<eos> You know, they said, if you keep it above the high watermark, then... - no-one else will touch it.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I think that's nice.<eos> It's Robbie, isn't it?<eos> Something's happened to Robbie.<eos> We don't know what's happened to Robbie yet, Leanne, but we are treating him as a missing person now, so I'm going to have to take a formal statement from you, okay?
You know?<eos> Liver still works.<eos> How did you find me?<eos> It was my lung got a hole in it.<eos> Monica?<eos> She's worried.<eos> How long you been holed up here?<eos> Since I got out.<eos> I went to your flat.<eos> They put you in hospital and tried to frame me for murder.
Inspector Thursday said you might be in, but I didn't think today.<eos> Well, the fair packs up tomorrow, sir. Just so.<eos> What happened, I...<eos> I can't change yesterday, but... ..a better tomorrow, yes?<eos> - For all of us. - Sir.<eos> I think I met Bixby. Briefly.<eos> Some years ago, in Juan-les-Pins.<eos> And there was never anything between you? No.<eos> Not on my part.<eos> And there's no reason you can think of why he'd have a photograph of you on his bedroom wall.
It's fizzing the wrong way.<eos> Our bubbles go up.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> We wouldn't have some glumptious, whizzpopping music?<eos> Does he like music?<eos> We have bagpipes.<eos> The generals have been briefed, ma'am.<eos> This is a story which beggars belief, but we don't have the time.<eos> We're on our way to Giant Country.<eos> BFG will chart a course for you.
What if I could give you the chance to say your final goodbye?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I was born in a village in South India.<eos> Surrounding our village was a big forest.<eos> And deep within this forest... there was an abandoned temple.<eos> It is said that the line between the world of the dead and the living... is very thin at this place.<eos> You should go there.<eos> Take the ashes of your son... spread them on the steps of this temple... lock yourself inside... and when night comes... he will come to you.<eos> And you will be able to talk to him through the door of the temple... say your final goodbye.<eos> I will leave you two alone.
But I just wanted to tell you that I miss you.<eos> I miss you, too.<eos> All right.<eos> I love you.<eos> Give Luce a kiss for me.<eos> Will do.<eos> Love you, too.<eos> Bye.<eos> Oliver?<eos> I see you there.
- Want some help?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Ready.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> - Happy birthday.<eos> - Happy birthday.<eos> Thanks, Mom.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Okay. - Thank you, Dad.<eos> Love you, guys.
But he sounded pretty much like that.<eos> - Are you all right, young lady?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, no, I'm good.<eos> No, um, I'm sorry.<eos> - I have more questions.<eos> - I'm sorry, this interview is over.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> I can't believe Richard let this happened.<eos> Did Richard put you up to this?
It shouldn't be like this, you know.<eos> I know she's still in there.<eos> She's just trapped.<eos> When I look at her eyes, I can see her screaming to get out.<eos> I thought of all people, you doctors, you know, you'd be able to give us some hope, you know.<eos> I mean, that's your job, right?<eos> - I wish you all a fantastic weekend.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And please praise yourself.<eos> I want to see you in my class next week.
Now, what is causing this inflammation that is the question that we have to answer.<eos> My dear, I know you're in there.<eos> I'm going to everything I can to find you.<eos> Before we move on to treatment, we need to confirm the cause of the inflammation.<eos> I think the best thing to do is to do a brain biopsy.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - We have to look at her brain.<eos> We have to take a small piece of her brain to confirm the diagnosis, before we can proceed with the treatment.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Mr. Cahalan, I promise you if she were my child, I would do the brain biopsy.
Whatever it is, you have to let it out.<eos> It's much better if you air it.<eos> You want to ask Jenny to marry you, right?<eos> The thing is...<eos> It's complicated. It's a big step.<eos> Already it's complicated?<eos> It's a... small step... for humanity... but a big step... for a man.<eos> Oh, Mike, you really are a mess, you know?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> This is Oxen... we don't see any guerillas in your area, Alpha Margo, but if you stick your heads up, they'll come looking for you,
That's it?<eos> What happened to "No one left behind"?<eos> Over.<eos> Listen to me, Sergeant Stevens, The type of mines scattered in that area can remain active for about 40 years... but ten years after production, so they say... about 4% will malfunction.<eos> After 15 years in, this can be as high as 7%.<eos> Great.<eos> Considering the situation, my personal advice... if you can't survive until we come... try the the Schumann Maneuver.<eos> The Schumann Maneuver, Major?<eos> It's a last resort.<eos> Dig a small trench to shelter you from the explosion... then fasten the sole of your boot to the ground.
You almost broke my cock.<eos> Can you break a cock?<eos> It consists of tendons.<eos> You snapped a tendon!<eos> Well, I got to take a break, ruminate, Consider the options.<eos> I'll miss the police.<eos> I liked the structure itself.<eos> Structure?<eos> Maybe it's good thing that we got fired.<eos> I was beginning to worry about you.
Where does the universe begin and where does it end?<eos> If you can't answer that, then you can't say that God doesn't exist.<eos> On the other hand, Pythagoras believed that after death your soul go into a fucking green bean.<eos> So what do I know.<eos> I love this car.<eos> It's indestructible.<eos> Like I always say Bob:<eos> if it ain't broke Break it.<eos> Detectives ...<eos> Glad to see you again.
That's enough.<eos> Okay?<eos> Your stud forgot his hernia belt.<eos> - You need a hand?<eos> - No, I've got it.<eos> Is it big enough?<eos> Any taller and the star will scrape the ceiling.<eos> Michèle!<eos> Evening.<eos> I'm so glad I caught you. Here...
Bend forward, from low in your back. Stretch your spine all the way to the floor.<eos> Deep breath.<eos> Push the floor with your left hand until seated again.<eos> Thank you all very much.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> Excellent work.<eos> Namaste.<eos> Hélène?<eos> I'm Michèle. Richard's ex.<eos> - Nice to meet you.
Anna and my son.<eos> I wonder if there wasn't some kind of imprinting, like with ducks.<eos> With me. on the other hand...<eos> - You know...<eos> -Sorry, they're paging me.<eos> Sometimes I look at Vincent, the big lout with nothing special about him that came out of my belly,<eos> and I have to admit I don't know him.<eos> - Evening, Michèle.<eos> - Evening, Rebecca.<eos> Patrick will walk you inside.
It's really not necessary, honestly.<eos> I have pepper spray in the house.<eos> Good to know.<eos> Light switch on your left there.<eos> Everything seems to be okay.<eos> Thanks, anyway. I appreciate it.<eos> No problem, I didn't do much.<eos> I nearly caught him, but he took off so fast.<eos> In high school, I ran the 1,000 meters in 2'42".<eos> Perhaps his speed shows how scared he was of you.
I'll do the other next.<eos> - Hi, Rebecca! - Hi.<eos> Michèle.<eos> Beautiful!<eos> - Evening.<eos> - Evening.<eos> The Nativity gets me every time.<eos> Where it all began.<eos> Very true.<eos> I know it's rude to invite you last minute, but I'm having a Christmas get-together tomorrow.
I've never done karate.<eos> She was making fun of me.<eos> Ok.<eos> You can't avoid me all night.<eos> Want a bet?<eos> I'm glad you made it.<eos> We don't get out much.<eos> Unfortunately for Rebecca, who's a very social person.<eos> Unlike me.<eos> I'm glad she dragged you over here tonight.
She won't be there, even if her plaque's next to his.<eos> I had a list of things to say to him.<eos> Nine bullet points.<eos> I killed you by coming here.<eos> Hello?<eos> Emilie Fontaine, reporter at Le Parisien.<eos> I was wondering if you'd like to comment on your father's passing.<eos> How did you get this number?<eos> I realize it's an awkward time.<eos> It's an opportunity for you...
Laying in bed, I asked her which of my books was her favorite.<eos> Why'd you do that?<eos> She said Scent of Poplar.<eos> Scent of Poplar is a novel by one Pierre Casamayou.<eos> I'd no idea there were two Casamayous.<eos> Apparently, he's talented.<eos> Poor Richard.<eos> Yes, poor Richard.<eos> So... it looks like somehow, despite our best efforts, we have a success on our hands.<eos> All I can say is thank you.
Have you seen this before?<eos> No... but we need to get it out.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Bravo one, over.<eos> Car approaching.<eos> - Access cleared.<eos> - Close the gates.<eos> Commencing perimeter sweep.<eos> Privilege to welcome you home at last, sir.<eos> Semira awaits you in her private chambers.
Bravo one, over.<eos> Car approaching.<eos> - Access cleared.<eos> - Close the gates.<eos> Commencing perimeter sweep.<eos> Privilege to welcome you home at last, sir.<eos> Semira awaits you in her private chambers.<eos> Semira?<eos> Where is Cassius?<eos> The entire council will greet you, of course, sir... but Semira requests just a few moments.
No.<eos> Father and son united in treason.<eos> Carry on with Selene.<eos> I'll deal with them.<eos> Come on.<eos> Go! Now!<eos> No!<eos> Dawn alert. 60 seconds to sunrise.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> The sun will burn you to ashes out there... or you can die with some grace in here.
There are too many of them.<eos> I've already killed you.<eos> Marius!<eos> - Marius.<eos> - Please.<eos> I wish your father was alive to see this.<eos> His ridiculous dream of you ruling this coven... will be the very thing that kills you.<eos> Missed.<eos> Oh, it worked.<eos> I'm one of you.
What's all this mud? Ooh!<eos> Step in the water.<eos> I got a job.<eos> It's in Kansas.<eos> Did you come all the way here to tell me that?<eos> What kind of fucking job you got in Kansas?<eos> Nathan can't have them, you know that.<eos> I can't have them.<eos> Is that the surprise?<eos> I can't take you to Kansas.
You know what I'm saying?<eos> Look right here.<eos> - Who is it?<eos> - Genuine boyfriend...<eos> - Hi, there.<eos> - Can I help you folks?<eos> Hi, yeah, I was just explaining to your daughter, we're part of the Three Cs contest, which is a collegiate communications competition.<eos> So we've been going door-to-door, sort of garner support for our team.<eos> Walking all day.<eos> You think I can get a glass of water from you?
Don't fight me right now.<eos> And this relationship thing with me and you? It's not happening, you know.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean, we just can't talk about it 'cause it's, um...<eos> She's got this thing.<eos> She says, you know, love is bad for business.<eos> So there's no relationships in the mag crew.<eos> It's just her thing.<eos> Just go with it.<eos> - But what about you and her?
# Money, money, money<eos> It means these people are making a shit load of money.<eos> And how does that make people feel when<eos> - they make that kind of cash?<eos> - Amazing!<eos> - Makes me wanna cream my jeans.<eos> - No, it makes them feel like shit.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - It makes them feel guilty.<eos> So I want y'all to dress like dirty white trash, and then they'll pity you.
Look at that mama with her baby.<eos> Kalium, there's a bee. There's a bee.<eos> Put some fucking shoes on.<eos> Put some damn shoes on.<eos> Hey, why are you dressed like that?<eos> - You dressed me like this.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> Y'all are gonna make hella money today.<eos> I'm taking you out to the oil fields.
- No, I didn't.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> Y'all are gonna make hella money today.<eos> I'm taking you out to the oil fields.<eos> These guys make like a hundred grand a year.<eos> Shit got real.<eos> They're away from home, - there's no ladies... - Ooh!<eos> Butter 'em up, baby.<eos> Butter 'em up!<eos> - It's gonna pump you up.
They're away from home, - there's no ladies... - Ooh!<eos> Butter 'em up, baby.<eos> Butter 'em up!<eos> - It's gonna pump you up.<eos> - It's gonna pump me up?<eos> I love getting pumped up.<eos> So get 'em before they get off to work.<eos> Let's do that shit.<eos> Long day selling magazines, huh, Bella?<eos> Check out this song I got for you.
All due respect, I will never hear what you have to say<eos> - 'cause it's dumb.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey!<eos> You two are partners, so you better get used to it!<eos> Tribeca, Geils.<eos> Geils, Tribeca.<eos> - Pleasure to meet you. - Yeah, right.<eos> Lieutenant, you know that partners never work for me.<eos> Well, maybe partner 237 is the charm.<eos> I've got a case for you two.

Baby-back ribs?<eos> They're from a pig.<eos> Just a touch early in the morning for me, thank you, ma'am. Okay.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Pretty sure.<eos> - They're here if you need them.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Who would try to extort money from my husband?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> What about you?
Did you really look for my mum?<eos> Looked everywhere<eos> You'll have a nice home<eos> Australia is a great place<eos> Does everybody have a napkin?<eos> - This is called a "serviette"<eos> - Serviette<eos> Lay it down on your lap like this so that food doesn't fall on your clot<eos> So it doesn't ruin them<eos> I'm going to teach you how to eat using cutlery
What are you saying?<eos> We...<eos> We... weren't blank pages, were we?<eos> Like your own would have been.<eos> You weren't just adopting us but our past as well.<eos> - I feel like, we're killing you.<eos> - I could have had kids.<eos> What?<eos> We chose not to have kids.<eos> We wanted the two of you.
- He's your brother!<eos> She's so big!<eos> It's me, Saroo.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Hi, mum.<eos> I know you will be sound asleep.<eos> I just want to say that I'm safe.<eos> I'm safe and the questions have been answered.<eos> There are no more dead-ends.<eos> I found my mother, and... she thanks you both for raising me.
You're an inspired scientist, but you're a terrible liar.<eos> Now, I admire the effort.<eos> I really do.<eos> Oh, look, here's Lyra, back from the dead.<eos> It's a miracle.<eos> Stop!<eos> Oh, Lyra, troublesome as ever.<eos> You're not taking him.<eos> No, of course I'm not.<eos> I'm taking you all.
15 years ago.<eos> Any idea where he's been all that time?<eos> I like to think he's dead.<eos> Makes things easier.<eos> Easier than what? That he's been a tool of the Imperial war machine?<eos> I've never had the luxury of political opinions.<eos> Really?<eos> When was your last contact with Saw Gerrera?<eos> It's been a long time.<eos> But he'll remember you, though.
And then, if possible, find your father.<eos> It appears he is critical to the development of this super weapon.<eos> Given the gravity of the situation and your history with Saw, we're hoping that he will help us locate your father and return him to the Senate for testimony.<eos> And if I do it?<eos> We'll make sure you go free.<eos> Captain Andor.<eos> I'm K-2SO.<eos> I'm a reprogrammed Imperial droid.<eos> I remember you.<eos> I see the Council is sending you with us to Jedha.
Give it to me.<eos> We're going to Jedha.<eos> That's a war zone.<eos> That's not the point.<eos> Where'd you get it?<eos> I found it.<eos> I find that answer vague and unconvincing.<eos> Trust goes both ways.<eos> You're letting her keep it?<eos> Would you like to know the probability of her using it against you?
The cause?<eos> Seriously?<eos> The Alliance... the rebels, whatever it is you're calling yourself these days... all it's ever brought me is pain.<eos> You can stand to see the Imperial flag reign across the galaxy?<eos> It's not a problem if you don't look up.<eos> I have something to show you.<eos> Come.<eos> The Emperor is awaiting my report.<eos> One would hope that he and Lord Vader might've been here for such an occasion.<eos> And I thought it prudent to save you from any potential embarrassment.
Go.<eos> Hurry!<eos> Excellent news, Galen.<eos> The battle station is complete.<eos> You must be very proud.<eos> Proud as I can be, Krennic.<eos> Gather your engineers. I have an announcement.<eos> Is that all of them?<eos> Yes.<eos> Gentlemen, one of you... betrayed the Empire.

I have an announcement.<eos> Is that all of them?<eos> Yes.<eos> Gentlemen, one of you... betrayed the Empire.<eos> One of you has conspired with a pilot... to send messages to the Rebellion.
One per pad.<eos> Pick your spot.<eos> We wanna draw them out.<eos> I'll call the timing.<eos> Hey, did you hear the rumors?<eos> Yeah, the T-15s have been marked obsolete.<eos> Oh boy, it's about time for that.<eos> Hey!<eos> What the...<eos> Director, what brings you to Scarif?
How about we just start with your name?<eos> My name is Edward Joseph Snowden.<eos> I'm 29 years old.<eos> I work as a private contractor for the NSA.<eos> I've also worked as a private contractor for the CIA and directly for the agency.<eos> I've worked in various jobs in the intelligence industry for the last nine years.<eos> I've been a systems engineer.<eos> Uh, been a solutions consultant and senior adviser for the Central Intelligence Agency.<eos> So you wanna be Special Forces? -Sir, yes sir!<eos> I think Special Forces would be ashamed to call you soldiers!
Efficiency, results, they go out the window.<eos> Not to mention ...<eos> Well, you're late for class.<eos> -Okay, thank you.<eos> Oh, can I take another one?<eos> -Sure.<eos> Did you ever say anything to anybody?<eos> Yeah, I went to legal.<eos> We filed complaints.<eos> Now here I am, tucked away, teaching you.
Enjoy the view.<eos> HONG KONG TUESDAY, June 4, 2013<eos> This is Laura. Hello.<eos> -Hello, nice to meet you.<eos> Ewen MacAskill from the Guardian. It's nice to meet you.<eos> -Nice to meet you, too.<eos> Um, if you don't mind, I'd like to record some... -Ah.<eos> Cell phones go in the microwave. -Dare I ask why?<eos> We'll get to that after you ask your questions.<eos> Before we get on to the story, I need to know more about you.
I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> But your colleague Charles has graciously offered his help.<eos> So I owe him and you a great deal.<eos> -Can I ask what happened?<eos> My daughter had a ...<eos> Marwan's daughter took too many sleeping pills. She's alright.<eos> It had something to do with her boyfriend, who was recently deported.<eos> We're trying to secure a visa for him.<eos> Even so, I'm afraid that Salma will... I'm sorry.<eos> I won't trouble you with such matters. Hey.
Or helping to oust some third world leader who's not playing ball.<eos> And ultimately the truth sinks in that no matter what justification you're selling yourself this is not about terrorism.<eos> Terrorism is the excuse.<eos> This is about economic and social control.<eos> And the only thing you're really protecting is the supremacy of your government.<eos> Did you think about going to journalists then?<eos> No, that wouldn't have occurred to me back then.<eos> I thought that the system will self correct.<eos> The President will keep the promise that got him elected.<eos> That's actually when I started reading about you and your films.
Sorry.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Did you access an unauthorized program?<eos> That I did not know about?<eos> Yes. It was, uh...<eos> It was in Geneva, it was Lindsay, I was jealous.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> I never did it again.<eos> Listen...<eos> I know it's been up and down with you and Lindsay since Geneva.
U.S. President Barack Obama staunchly defends U.S. government programs insisting that they were conducted with broad safeguards to protect against abuse.<eos> He reached the conclusion that what was happening inside this really secretive agency was very threatening and menacing to privacy rights, to Internet freedom, to basic political liberty.<eos> Not only in the United States but all around the world.<eos> And he felt it was his duty as a human being to disclose it.<eos> My name is Ed Snowden.<eos> I'm 29 years old. I work for Booz Allen Hamilton. as an infrastructure analyst for NSA in Hawaii.<eos> Well, you can't come forward against the most powerful intelligence agencies in the world without expecting to have some risk.<eos> They're just such powerful adversaries.<eos> No one can meaningfully oppose them.<eos> If they wanna get you, they will get you in time.
You guys get going.<eos> I will answer your questions in an orderly fashion.<eos> Please.<eos> Did you get them?<eos> -Yeah, this is the best I could do.<eos> You'll be meeting Tibbo in five minutes.<eos> On the skybridge opposite the large mall.<eos> I've met a lot of astonishing people in my life, but you...<eos> Okay, laddie, off you go.<eos> I won't let you down.
- Excellent.<eos> - Very easy to work with.<eos> - And you're gonna play the setlist?<eos> Happy to.<eos> Even though I don't think anybody cares what I play.<eos> But yeah.<eos> Well, if by "anyone" you mean anyone other than me, that would be correct.<eos> I care, and I don't wanna hear the free jazz.<eos> Right.<eos> Although I... I thought that in this town worked on a sort of... "one for you, one for me" type system.

I'll be out front at 8:00 am.<eos> You'll be out front or not. I don't know.<eos> How did you find me here?<eos> The house in front of the library.<eos> - I got coffee. - Okay, great.<eos> Mia?<eos> I'm Amy and this is Frank.<eos> - Hi, how are you?<eos> - Pleasure to meet you.<eos> - I'm glad we found you.
Did you kill her?<eos> Oh, God, help me.<eos> Oh, please, God, forgive me.<eos> You and your sister look so much alike.<eos> Almost like twins.<eos> Yeah, people thought that a lot when we were younger.<eos> - Are you close?<eos> - Occasionally.<eos> So when did you see my parents last?<eos> I only asked because they never talked about you.

- Are you the man?<eos> - What?<eos> Stay away from little girls.<eos> Love.<eos> Grand, isn't it?<eos> I was in love once.<eos> Marriage is buying a house for someone you hate.<eos> Remember that.<eos> I'm here with a representative of the Detroit Auto Manufacturers, Mr Bergen Paulsen.<eos> And, Mr Paulsen, glad to have you here.
Love.<eos> Grand, isn't it?<eos> I was in love once.<eos> Marriage is buying a house for someone you hate.<eos> Remember that.<eos> I'm here with a representative of the Detroit Auto Manufacturers, Mr Bergen Paulsen.<eos> And, Mr Paulsen, glad to have you here.<eos> I understand that you're in town for the big show.<eos> Tell us a little bit about it.<eos> Take a look at this outstanding line-up we have here for you.
Any of you know why you're protesting?<eos> - The air.<eos> - Air.<eos> - You're protesting the air?<eos> - The pollution.<eos> The birds can't breathe.<eos> So all of you died because of the pollution?<eos> Right.<eos> What about the gas masks?<eos> They didn't save you?
Hey, dickhead. She's not here.<eos> She's not here because of her boyfriend.<eos> Her boyfriend died, like really died, like three days ago.<eos> - Her boyfriend died?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So where is she?<eos> Sorry, can't help you.<eos> We're dead.<eos> God damn it.<eos> All right, which one of you cock and balls wants to make 20 bucks, huh?
You ain't got long to live.<eos> Well, buddy, none of us do.<eos> - Healy, there's no one here.<eos> - He didn't make it.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And that'll be the cops.<eos> Look, pal, you already got our statements.<eos> Can I go see my daughter now?<eos> Sir, I was told to keep you here, so I'm keeping you here.
We've been watching interviews, and it sounds like you might have saved my daughter's life.<eos> That was mostly Holly.<eos> - His daughter.<eos> - It's genetics.<eos> Would you like a mint?<eos> I need your help.<eos> But I wanna know if I can trust you.<eos> I'm kinda getting the idea that, you know, you might not have much choice.<eos> Well, my situation is very delicate.<eos> Hey, that's where I know you from, right?
- Like a crusader.<eos> Should I be writing this down?<eos> Yeah, write it down.<eos> The Vegas mob is trying to spread its porn operation to Hollywood Boulevard.<eos> And I'm doing everything I can to stop it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Porn is bad.<eos> Something I don't understand.<eos> Your daughter, she did a film with Sid Shattuck.<eos> Now, why would she do that when she knows that's just gonna be extremely professionally embarrassing for you?
She might wanna be at home.<eos> She doesn't trust me.<eos> She thinks I am the government.<eos> She thinks I'm behind all of this.<eos> Somewhere she's out there and she won't call home because she thinks her mother's going to have her killed.<eos> Here.<eos> You wanna use that?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> - No?<eos> I wanna hire you both.
What's good for Detroit is good for America.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> The America I love owes its life to the Big Three.<eos> But it's all right for you to fail your daughter?<eos> - Detroit had her killed.<eos> - I think I read about that.<eos> The whole city got together, took a vote.<eos> Big turnout.<eos> I wanted her safe.<eos> That's why I hired you two.
Take those.<eos> A gift from the guys, and I don't eat them.<eos> Me neither, you know.<eos> Still...<eos> I'll take them.<eos> You've come to visit the general?<eos> Yes.<eos> Your name?<eos> Colonel Lebedev is my name.<eos> I can't find you here for some reason.
Please sign here and here.<eos> You'll be released on parole in several weeks.<eos> What about my cassation appeal?<eos> Unfortunately, it was rejected.<eos> Therefore, the court decision on dissolution of your marriage with Ms. Voskresenskaya Tatyana Aleksandrovna remains valid.<eos> And how can they dissolve my marriage without me?<eos> I did not agree to that!<eos> According to para. two of Article 19 in the Family Code, the dissolution of marriage is performed upon request of one of the spouses regardless of the consent of the second spouse, if he or she is sentenced to imprisonment for more than three years.<eos> Damn!<eos> Maybe it's for the better for you.
When I saw those two men in the newspapers, the ones who had their heads cut off, I called immediately.<eos> They were walking around here together, searching for something, looking inside the cars.<eos> Were they walking for a long time?<eos> About three hours or so.<eos> -The one in the sportswear, what's his name...<eos> Shilov.<eos> He couldn't remember the spot.<eos> Which spot?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Has the investigator asked you about something?
There are four cases, exactly the same.<eos> Murder apprehension, lack of evidence or unproven corpus delicti.<eos> Trial, and they let the defendant go.<eos> Shevtsov takes the defendant.<eos> The latter disappears.<eos> I did everything right.<eos> What about two bodies in the waste lot? Right next to the police station?<eos> And what should I have told them?<eos> Good job guys, you recognized me, it was me who killed Komarov.<eos> Please come to my car, I'll take you to a quieter place and kill you there not from a service weapon. Right?
Strike impossible.<eos> Damn!<eos> Unfortunately, we have to take your car.<eos> And why is it so?<eos> You haven't been repaying your loan for four months.<eos> You don't work anywhere officially.<eos> I have to pass the matter to the court.<eos> Well then, I don't know... arrange a repayment holiday for me.<eos> Unfortunately, it is impossible.<eos> What if I really ask you for it?
Louder.<eos> I confirm it.<eos> Take him away.<eos> Bastard!<eos> Filth!<eos> I hate you!<eos> Congratulations. Why?<eos> You found a job?<eos> You may phrase it that way.<eos> Now, I won't be able to help you out.
I'll send him to an institution, and his aunt as well.<eos> Keys!<eos> I never thought you were such a monster.<eos> He's your son!<eos> This does not concern you.<eos> Keys, faster.<eos> I need to take my things.<eos> You'll pick them up tomorrow at the door.<eos> Out!<eos> I've worked three years for you, no weekends, and you...
So what is it about?<eos> A Grecian stock is also called an evening-scented stock.<eos> Its flowers are closed during the day and open up at night.<eos> Novikov's sister had the smell of opened flowers on her.<eos> But how could she open the door and go outside at night? She's disabled.<eos> This means she's not that disabled, after all.<eos> Here's a form for your claim and a questionnaire, please fill those out.<eos> Do you have a health record?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Then we'll first register you as Yegor's nanny hired upon recommendation from our facility, and in six months, you can apply for custody over Yegor.
But nobody will find it out.<eos> Some fresh air will do you good.<eos> You're such a sleaze ball.<eos> Ms. Zimina, you're accused of killing Irina Novikova.<eos> You've played your role well.<eos> You'll have to come with us.<eos> It was Tina who killed Ira.<eos> But I have no proof.<eos> Then... do what I say.<eos> We're sorry we had to put you at risk.
Alyona lived in the dorm.<eos> She couldn't rent an expensive apartment.<eos> She never had the money, and neither did we.<eos> And who paid for her studies?<eos> The state.<eos> She is on a scholarship.<eos> She was.<eos> -Do you work in construction?<eos> -No, I work in the district archive.<eos> I can feel the smell of cement from you.
-Maksim, fill out form eight.<eos> -All right. Follow me.<eos> -And you stay.<eos> So what were you doing in Alyona's apartment on the day of the murder?<eos> I came to get the money.<eos> Which money?<eos> You understand... Alyona helped us with the money every month.<eos> Galya doesn't know anything about it... But you must understand, I have a very small salary...<eos> Where does Alyona get this money from?<eos> I really ask you not to tell Galya about it.
Well, once a month when I picked up the payment.<eos> Have you seen any strangers in the house?<eos> No. No.<eos> Alyona was always alone.<eos> Yes, on thin dough.<eos> -Cured beef, salami...<eos> -Sausages.<eos> Sausages.<eos> And... a diet one, with corn.<eos> Apart from you, who else has keys from this apartment?
I change the locks after each tenant.<eos> Boris Andreyevich, when did you last see Alyona?<eos> On Friday morning, when I picked up the money.<eos> And where were you in the evening of the same day?<eos> I went fishing out of the city.<eos> Who can confirm that?<eos> Unfortunately, nobody.<eos> I always fish alone.<eos> You'll have to give up fishing for a while.<eos> I'll ask you not to leave the city until the end of the investigation.
Have you noticed any changes in Yelena's appearance lately?<eos> If you're talking about silicone, she doesn't need that at all.<eos> You said that Andreyeva has been on vacation since yesterday.<eos> Yes, but this morning she came to say goodbye.<eos> She hugged and kissed me, I was even surprised.<eos> -And where does she live?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> And how do we find out?<eos> In the HR department, they've got her file.<eos> I'll take you there.
Some American tourist took a service weapon away from an officer.<eos> Like a toy from a child.<eos> Due to your incompetent, unprofessional actions, you blew the operation.<eos> The American was in our hands.<eos> Now, we lost him.<eos> Today, a decision was made at the general meeting to create a special investigation group for Crosby's case.<eos> This group will be lead... by Colonel Lebedev.<eos> Your operation is no longer top secret.<eos> Please, familiarize the group with the details of the case.<eos> We are listening to you with great attention.
Sometimes, I even picture how I dip him headfirst in the soup pot.<eos> But you're restraining your temper.<eos> Yes.<eos> -I'm trying.<eos> -Good.<eos> Let us thank Katya for the work she's done.<eos> And that's all for today, I'll see you at the next session.<eos> Tell me please, how much longer do I have to come here?<eos> You have to take the whole course of anger management.<eos> And only when I see that you fully mastered self-control and became emotionally open, I'll remove you from the list.
I am not totally sure.<eos> Do you see anything strange here?<eos> Hypoclamin.<eos> A medicine for hypertension.<eos> Nothing unusual.<eos> The vaccination is done here for the fourth year in a row, no accidents.<eos> We probably won't find anything interesting here.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> We need doctor Semyonov.<eos> I am listening to you.
We need doctor Semyonov.<eos> I am listening to you.<eos> Sorry, but we need another Semyonov.<eos> We don't have another Semyonov in our center.<eos> What is the purpose of your visit?<eos> Colonel Lebedev, Special Investigation Bureau.<eos> Then who performed vaccination at our place?<eos> You had vaccination?<eos> That can't be.<eos> I am to visit you... the day after tomorrow.
-Are there any guards on night duty?<eos> -What do they have to guard here?<eos> They need to be here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait a minute!<eos> You're Tatyana Voskresenskaya's friend, right?<eos> -Yes, what's the matter?<eos> -Let's move aside.<eos> I don't want us to be seen together.<eos> I really ask you to. That's absurd.
No. Just your regular man.<eos> -Goodbye.<eos> -Goodbye.<eos> Did you see Ivanova after she had been discharged?<eos> No. Her father took her away and that's all.<eos> I'll take her clinical record with me, if you do not object.<eos> Of course, you may.<eos> And if you remember any details or something unusual, please contact me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll see you off.
He's come to his senses.<eos> Damn it!<eos> -Good morning.<eos> -Where am I?<eos> It's the second time you're trying to die in my presence.<eos> I won't let you do that.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Why did you kidnap me?<eos> I didn't kidnap you.
We need you and your talent.<eos> Together, we'd be able to create a perfect system of justice.<eos> How?<eos> You'll be doing what you've always done, look for criminals.<eos> And we'll make them pay their price.<eos> What if I refuse?<eos> It is your right.<eos> That is, I am free to go?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Aren't you afraid that I turn you in?
Maksim!<eos> Yes?<eos> Let Kuleshov go.<eos> I got it.<eos> Your breakfast.<eos> Too bad you don't eat.<eos> You have to get used to such food.<eos> Believe me, it's a rather decent breakfast.<eos> It'll be much worse in prison.<eos> In spite of everything, I do not bear a grudge against you.

We shouldn't have trusted him. We shouldn't have.<eos> Colonel allowed unqualified experts to participate in the investigation, he brought this Pavlovian dog of his.<eos> And what came out of it?<eos> They are going away.<eos> What did I do?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I must give myself up.<eos> Don't be stupid.<eos> I am not going to risk the whole organization just because your conscience has suddenly sprung back to life.<eos> Either you're working with us or I'll liquidate you.
You can contain yourself.<eos> Listen, what kind of nonsense are you telling us?<eos> He is beating her, and she's containing herself.<eos> And you are just sitting here.<eos> Wide-eyed and open-mouthed.<eos> Go on, good girl.<eos> Keep containing yourself.<eos> But you'd better take a frying pan and hit him on the head at least once.<eos> And your shame would all be gone, this I can promise you.<eos> I am asking you to...
I won't mark your today's session.<eos> I could care less about your sessions and your certificate.<eos> These stupid cows.<eos> Sitting here and containing themselves.<eos> Keep containing yourselves!<eos> Only without me.<eos> We have our people in all security agencies.<eos> And more of them arrive there each day.<eos> A short time will pass, the old system of justice will collapse, and we'll come in its place.<eos> We are building this box for you.
Only without me.<eos> We have our people in all security agencies.<eos> And more of them arrive there each day.<eos> A short time will pass, the old system of justice will collapse, and we'll come in its place.<eos> We are building this box for you.<eos> Autonomous air-conditioning and air purification.<eos> You'll be able to stay there without any filters.<eos> And for now, you'll live in the guest box.<eos> It's small, but only temporary.<eos> We'll create a full-fledged laboratory for you.
We continue searching the bank and the water surface, but...<eos> What do you have?<eos> Somebody penetrated our security system and changed the codec in the record files from surveillance cameras.<eos> This is why we weren't able to see anything.<eos> And three days ago, someone penetrated the system again and changed the codec back.<eos> So it wasn't a virus. It was an external penetration.<eos> Have you managed to establish the IP address?<eos> No.<eos> Naturally, we won't touch your nose, but here, here... and here, we can change that.<eos> What if we make Hugh Laurie out of you?
Good to see you.<eos> Hello, Howard.<eos> Hey. Hi.<eos> James McGill, Clifford Main.<eos> Just "Jimmy." And it's a pleasure to meet you, Clifford.<eos> Likewise.<eos> We know all about your work on Sandpiper.<eos> Well, it's a group effort.<eos> I mean, the folks at HHM are just knocking it out of the park.<eos> Well, you know, the case wouldn't exist without you.
Not yet, we didn't.<eos> - Boom.<eos> - Hey, hey, cheers.<eos> Uh, I think we're ready for the check.<eos> No, really, it's the smart way to go.<eos> Okay.<eos> But, so, to be clear, you take the money directly from our account and invest it.<eos> - Diversify.<eos> - Diversify it.<eos> And then all the dividends and all the profits and the...what-have-you comes back into our account.
I will burn the heart out of you.<eos> Right. This should do it.<eos> - You wearing any pants?<eos> Okay. - No.<eos> This is how I want you to remember me, the woman who beat you.<eos> But there never was any monster. Sherlock!<eos> Here we are at last.<eos> - Goodbye, John.<eos> - Sherlock!<eos> Those things will kill you.
Why didn't you ask her?<eos> How could I?<eos> What with me not talking and everything!<eos> For God's sake, give her some lines, she's perfectly capable of starving us!<eos> Good afternoon, I'm Sherlock Holmes. This is my friend and colleague, Dr Watson.<eos> You may speak freely in front of him as he barely understands a word.<eos> Holmes!<eos> However, before you do, allow me to make some trifling observations.<eos> You have an impish sense of humour, which currently you are deploying to ease a degree of personal anguish.<eos> You have recently married a man of a seemingly kindly disposition who has now abandoned you for an unsavoury companion of dubious morals.
Myself.<eos> Lestrade, do stop loitering by the door and come in.<eos> How did you know it was me?<eos> Regulation tread is unmistakable.<eos> Lighter than Jones, heavier than Gregson.<eos> Oh, yeah, I just came up.<eos> Mrs Hudson didn't seem to be talking.<eos> I fear she has branched into literary criticism by means of satire.<eos> It is a distressing trend in the modern landlady.<eos> What brings you here in your off-duty hours?
Watson, give the Inspector what he so clearly wants.<eos> So, Lestrade, what could we do for you?<eos> Oh, I'm not here on business, I just thought I'd drop by.<eos> Social call?<eos> Of course, just to wish you the compliments of the season.<eos> - Merry Christmas.<eos> - Merry Christmas.<eos> - Merry Christmas.<eos> - Merry Christmas. Thank God that's over.<eos> Now, Inspector, what strange happening compels you to my door, but embarrasses you to relate?
The obliquity of the ecliptic.<eos> "Come at once," you said, I assumed it was important.<eos> It is.<eos> It's the inclination of the Earth's equator to the path of the sun on the celestial plane.<eos> You've been swatting up.<eos> - Why would I do that?<eos> I am clever. - To sound clever.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> You see what?<eos> I deduce we are on our way to see someone cleverer than you.
That is easily got.<eos> - And help.<eos> - Not always so easy.<eos> Something has happened, Mr Holmes. Something... Unusual and...<eos> - Then you are in luck.<eos> "Luck."<eos> Those are my specialisms.<eos> This is really very promising.<eos> Holmes.<eos> Please, do tell us, what has so distressed you?
Well, that's not the impression you gave your wife, sir.<eos> She's an hysteric, prone to fancies.<eos> No.<eos> I'm sorry, what did you say?<eos> I said, no, she's not an hysteric. She's a highly intelligent woman of rare perception.<eos> My wife sees terror in an orange pip.<eos> Your wife can see worlds where no one else can see anything of value whatsoever.<eos> Can she really?<eos> And how do you deduce that, Mr Holmes?<eos> She married you.
And how do you deduce that, Mr Holmes?<eos> She married you.<eos> I assume she was capable of finding a reason.<eos> I'll do my best to save your life tonight. But first, it would help if you would explain your connection to the Ricoletti case.<eos> Ricoletti?<eos> Yes. In detail, please.<eos> Never heard of her.<eos> Interesting, I didn't mention she was a woman.<eos> We'll show ourselves out.<eos> I hope to see you again in the morning.
Had what?<eos> - Well, you must've had...<eos> - You know.<eos> - No.<eos> Experiences.<eos> Pass me your revolver, I have a sudden need to use it.<eos> Damn it, Holmes, you are flesh and blood, you have feelings, you have...<eos> You must have... Impulses.<eos> Dear lord, I have never been so impatient to be attacked by a murderous ghost.<eos> As your friend, as someone who worries about you, what made you like this?
I once heard a man say that, in Africa, the sun is like a furnace that either melts you... or forges you.
There's no chance of that.<eos> Your mother will pray for you.<eos> You know she's got a direct line to God.<eos> Company!<eos> Attention!<eos> The UN was established to ensure that the nations of the world would never again engage in another world war.<eos> We are the second wave of Irish soldiers to be sent into the Congo.<eos> So far, it has cost nine Irish lives.<eos> So this is where it gets serious for every single one of us.<eos> Nobody has shot at you, tried to kill you before.
These people you're here to protect... are you sure they want you?<eos> I have my doubts.<eos> But I also have my orders.<eos> You follow all orders?<eos> I'm a soldier.<eos> That's how it's done.<eos> I looked up the Irish army to see how many wars they have been in.<eos> You know what I found?<eos> None.<eos> And as for you, Commandant... you have never been in battle.
The real problem's the ammo.<eos> We've only 13,000 rounds.<eos> It's not gonna last long.<eos> Sir, I've got General McEntee.<eos> General, request an immediate update.<eos> Report your situation, Commandant.<eos> Company A, Jadotville has been under mortar and machine-gun fire.<eos> Expect a heavy attack any moment.<eos> I sent a man.<eos> I told you this was coming.
- Don't shoot, don't shoot.<eos> Go.<eos> Go now!<eos> Get to the ground slowly.<eos> Get down!<eos> Jones, you've got to be kidding me.<eos> Put these two in holding.<eos> Jade, what we just saw stays in the department.<eos> The public doesn't need to know.<eos> It is all over the police scanner, they are hunting you.
Just my regular hockey game.<eos> Do you want to come watch me play?<eos> Watch?<eos> I'll take you one on one.<eos> And I'll kick your butt.<eos> I bet you will.<eos> My key's totally bigger.<eos> It's bigger than your key, man. I got the big key.<eos> I think you should give people more credit.<eos> They'll accept you now.
Ma'am?<eos> Do you speak English?<eos> What year is it?<eos> The year?<eos> What year is this?<eos> Why, it's 1948.<eos> Who won?<eos> Who won the Battle of Culloden?<eos> Do you not feel well?<eos> Perhaps I could take you...
Yes, Roger?<eos> Please, may I go outside to play?<eos> Of course, you may.<eos> You keep your breeks out of the dirt, or Mrs. Graham will be on the warpath.<eos> Yes, father.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> No, no, no, he's fine.<eos> He's fine.<eos> I, I doubt he heard very much.<eos> I don't think I've ever heard him call you father.
Mr. Duane Reade.<eos> Where do you presently reside?<eos> The Cave.<eos> Do you mean Cavendish State Penitentiary?<eos> That's what I said.<eos> How is it you find yourself there?<eos> They say a burglary.<eos> I say trespassing.<eos> I didn't leave with nothing.<eos> Isn't that because the police apprehended you before you could get out the door with the Fujitsu TV you were carrying?
You're leaving me alone with the undertaker?<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> What's going on here, Mr. Day?<eos> She threw a lit cigarette next to the gas pump I was standing at.<eos> I put it out.<eos> Is that how people usually put out cigarettes, on someone's car window?<eos> I know guys put it out in their mouth.<eos> Just before you put it out, you knocked on the window, like people do to say "Roll it down."<eos> And we saw that she didn't roll it down.<eos> Do you think she might have been afraid of you?
Evelyn's will.<eos> It entitled you to something when Evelyn died even though you'd been married just two years.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And Andrea was unhappy with that?<eos> "Outraged" is the word.<eos> Outraged you were to get half her mother's estate, which included the home on 87th Street, which has a current market value of about 10 million dollars.<eos> That's right.<eos> So outraged she filed an appeal in a probate court in hopes it would agree with her you deserved nothing.<eos> That's right.<eos> Did that outrage you?
Is the time of filing on there?<eos> 8:00 a.m.<eos> You know what time Surrogate's Court opens?<eos> 8:00 a.m.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> And when was Andrea's funeral?<eos> That Wednesday.<eos> So, two days before you buried her, you applied for her trust fund.<eos> I think I've got the time line straight.<eos> Just one more question. When Andrea asked you to move out, do you know if she changed the locks after that?
Or he could have just taken it.<eos> He had power of attorney.<eos> In any case, she knew.<eos> He said he went home after this, and he did, via the Midtown Tunnel, through a cash lane, even though he's got an E-ZPass.<eos> Yeah.<eos> At 2:00 a.m.<eos> And here he is at 3:00 a.m.<eos> We've got more on the kid.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, Mrs. Weiss has presented to us a case...<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the Constitution asks of you to review...

That makes you one of a kind.<eos> And the fact that you under my wing?<eos> It's like... like I got something nobody else got.<eos> It's like... like I got a unicorn.<eos> So why would I not take care of you?<eos> What kind of a cold individual do you think I am?<eos> All rise.<eos> How we doing?<eos> Not good.<eos> Well, I'm sorry to hear that, but I have to ask you to go back.
Shall we impanel a new jury for retrial? Say, next week?<eos> No, Your Honor.<eos> My office declines to prosecute further.<eos> You're free.<eos> Free to go home.<eos> As per usual, I see some old faces.<eos> Glad you learned your lesson.<eos> Now for the freshmen, I'll keep it simple.<eos> You get told to do something, you do it. Gate!<eos> You lay a finger on any of us, we break out the riot gear, we put you in the fucking hospital, and we add another charge.
So I understand why he, you know, did the whole Aquaspin thing.<eos> Touring is expensive today.<eos> Why you think I do the A$ap Crunchables?<eos> This is Gary Sikes. This is the label photographer.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> All right.<eos> There we go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right. Got the two of you.
I'm in all of our meetings.<eos> Dude, just leave, all right?<eos> Go have a meeting with Lawrence.<eos> You know it's not my fault that the album's not selling, okay?<eos> Don't take it out on me.<eos> Great.<eos> Harry, we have to get rid of Hunter, all right?<eos> I'm not asking.<eos> I'm telling. You represent me, not him.<eos> Okay, look, well, actually, technically, full disclosure, I represent both of you.
Hi, how are you?<eos> I just... you see what I'm talking about here.<eos> Mr. Hutchinson, could you please look that over for me?<eos> I got my own copy, this is for you.<eos> We can get going, I'll look over what I have.<eos> Let me help you outside.
Yeah, I saw that.<eos> Something is.<eos> - Go.<eos> - How's GI Joe doing?<eos> Jury's still out, what have you got?<eos> Cincinnati PD has James Jackson in custody.<eos> We're on it.<eos> We just got a front row seat to the shit show.<eos> Can't wait.<eos> - Agent Montgomery, good to see you.
Wouldn't even release his body to us.<eos> We had to bury an empty casket.<eos> Jeffrey Hubert of Hubert International attended the opening of his newest North coast branch yesterday.<eos> It was just three days ago when one of his downtown branches was robbed in what I'm told was a very sophisticated operation.<eos> In spite of initial rumors of pending arrest, the police have released no real info...<eos> Drive to work.<eos> Unlock the safety deposit boxes.<eos> We know the bank has a secret access code.<eos> Do exactly as you are instructed and no one will be harmed.<eos> Otherwise, we will kill you.
- Just a coffee would be great.<eos> Strong feather.<eos> Open box 3-5-1-1-1.<eos> Wait!<eos> Don't!<eos> Will, get down!<eos> On the ground.<eos> Cell phones in front of you.<eos> Put your palms on the floor.<eos> Hit the alarm or call the police and we will kill you.

I'm thinking it's pretty fitting they're having their little bitch fest in a graveyard.<eos> Heard you met with Vanessa Adler.<eos> - Yeah, you know her?<eos> - Yeah, I banged her a couple times.<eos> No, we bounce information back and forth once in awhile.<eos> - She actually went to college with my wife.<eos> - Oh, yeah, you married?<eos> How long?<eos> - Almost 10 years.<eos> - How'd she fall for you?
Robin Hood.<eos> I think it would be more useful for both of us if you didn't worry about trying to trace this.<eos> So I won't have to hang up and we can have a conversation.<eos> You're taking an awful lot of risks.<eos> Purposefully leaving evidence at the scenes, sending me stuff, now calling me at home.<eos> Yet, you still don't know who I am.<eos> Oh, I assume you have theories.<eos> Have you considered the possibility that I'm helping you catch - a greater criminal than myself?<eos> - Yeah, that's crossed my mind, but I really don't give a damn, your crew's killed two people.<eos> I'm after you.
All of you with your Business and Law degrees and Alexander, - is a Philosophy major at Dartmouth?<eos> - What's your point?<eos> Well, one of my agents came across a paper he wrote, it was published, about the corruption of government and the banking system and its negative impact on society.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He was a bright guy.<eos> Quite the young liberal.<eos> I take it you lean a little more to the right.<eos> Not this year.<eos> - I'm trying to stay out of it. - Me too.<eos> I never would've taken you as an enthusiast of the macabre.
Let's go, now!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Keep moving.<eos> Move, move, move!<eos> Down!<eos> Move, move, move, let's go! Move it out, move it out now!<eos> Lower your weapons and we will not harm you.<eos> No, what are you doing?<eos> Down here! I'll fucking kill her, I'll fucking do it, I'll fucking kill her!<eos> So which one of you creeped up on my computer last night?
- Except for Dagley. Dagley, who is connected to Cook... who is connected to Hutchinson... who is connected to Hubert... who coincidentally hires Dagley after his time in the military. Jesus.<eos> Are you guys saying what I think you're saying?<eos> - What do you think we're saying?<eos> - That Jeffrey Hubert, what... that he somehow staged the whole thing just to kill off his little brother?<eos> Agent Montgomery, you told me to let you know if PD tried to release Hubert.<eos> - Why are we holding Hubert?<eos> They're letting him go right now.<eos> No one leaves without my permission!<eos> Oh, Senator Cook, what a coincidence.<eos> My colleagues and I were just talking about you.

I didn't mean to...<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Doing what?<eos> You're not sick.<eos> You could just leave all of this and run away.<eos> Why do you stay?<eos> Rebecca, what the hell...<eos> You can't save us.<eos> Get out of here!<eos> I'm not going to leave you.
This is the palace of the fearful King,<eos> And this the regal seat.<eos> Possess it, York,<eos> For this is thine and not King Henry's heirs'.<eos> Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will.<eos> We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.<eos> Thanks, gentle Vernon.<eos> Stay by me, then, my Lords.<eos> And when the King comes, offer him no violence,<eos> Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.
And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?<eos> It must and shall be so.<eos> Content thyself.<eos> Be Duke of Lancaster.<eos> let him be King.<eos> He is both King and Duke of Lancaster,<eos> And that the Lord of Westmorland shall maintain.<eos> And Warwick shall disprove it.<eos> You forget<eos> That we are those which chased you from the field
How began it first?<eos> No quarrel, but a slight contention.<eos> About what?<eos> The crown of England, Father, which is yours.<eos> Mine, boy?<eos> Not till King Henry be dead.<eos> Your right depends not on his life or death.<eos> Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now.<eos> By giving the House of Lancaster leave to breathe,<eos> It will outrun you, Father, in the end.
Therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.<eos> Warwick, answer me one doubt.<eos> What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?<eos> This assures my constant loyalty.<eos> That, if our Queen and this young Prince agree...<eos> I'll join mine youngest daughter, Lady Anne<eos> To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.<eos> Yes...<eos> I agree.<eos> And thank you for your motion.
To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales<eos> Unto the brother of your loving bride.<eos> She better would have suited me than Rivers.<eos> Alas poor Clarence<eos> Is it for a wife that thou art malcontent?<eos> Well, I will provide thee.<eos> And in choosing for yourself you've shown your judgment,<eos> Which being shallow, you shall give me leave<eos> To play the broker in mine own behalf.<eos> And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.
And haste is needful in this desp'rate case.<eos> They are already, or quickly will be, landed.<eos> I need to levy men and make for war.<eos> But ere I go, brother Richard...<eos> Tell me if YOU love Warwick more than me.<eos> If it be so, then go, depart to him.<eos> I rather wish for foes than hollow friends.<eos> Will you stand by us?<eos> Yay.<eos> And in despite of those that shall withstand you.
We all know what he's capable of.<eos> That was, like, 10 years ago.<eos> People change.<eos> The Martians said you were OPA.<eos> Stop talking about stuff that you know nothing about, because...<eos> I vote "no."<eos> Holden's got a point.<eos> We gotta go somewhere.<eos> Amos?<eos> I'm with you, boss.
Something.<eos> Something worth spilling a lot of blood over.<eos> Miller, maybe this is above your pay-grade.<eos> You don't think I can do it, huh?<eos> You don't think I can crack the case?<eos> No, I mean, you need to take this upstairs.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe.<eos> Until then, I'll just, uh...<eos> I guess I'll do my pathetic best.<eos> Yeah, we hear you loud and clear, UN1, but we don't think that you're hearing us.
Strange times, indeed.<eos> Call it a conflict of interest.<eos> Whatever gets you through the day, beratna.<eos> To keeping the peace...<eos> You know, the holding cells are full of OPA tats.<eos> Street trash and radical factions are not OPA, despite what their skin tells you.<eos> Good answer.<eos> I'm sorry about your partner.<eos> An appalling injustice.<eos> And I assure you, the piece of trash who tried to crucify him is not one of our ranks.
They see the stars, and they think, "Mine."<eos> What's your point?<eos> Earthers have a home.<eos> It's time Belters had one, too.<eos> It's important we don't get distracted from that goal...<eos> There's a single contact in that unit.<eos> Call it, and you'll get Filat Kothari's location.<eos> He's yours, to do whatever you think is right to...<eos> Sounds like a bribe.<eos> I haven't asked you for anything.
Are you sure you want to find out if that's true?<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> You might want to don a poncho, Holden.<eos> You don't want to test this particular guy.<eos> I've raised and buried your kind by the hundreds.<eos> Not my kind.<eos> Broken boys, quick to the trigger, slow on the uptake.<eos> Go ahead, son.<eos> Pull it, bullet will cut right through me, but there'll be countless OPA brothers and sisters standing behind me.<eos> They will hunt you to the ends of the Belt.
When you arrive on Eros, your cargo will be held under lien until your fines are paid in full.<eos> Oh, come on, there must be something...<eos> - Hey! - Leave him alone.<eos> Dzeet! Dzeet! Dzeet!<eos> Dzeet! Why are you doing this?<eos> Impound our haul and there's nothing left for your taxman.<eos> Oh, are we being too hard on you?<eos> Should we cut you a break?<eos> We are just tryin' to feed our families, okay?<eos> I'll tell you what I'm gonna do for you...
Yup.<eos> All video feeds are lookin' good.<eos> This is bullshit.<eos> - You can't just treat me like some...<eos> - "Canary in a coal mine?"<eos> All right, people.<eos> Hold on to your helmets.<eos> Docking tunnel is engaged.<eos> Connection... Is good.<eos> After you.
If he wants to stay, let him.<eos> There's nothing you can do for her.<eos> And if you stay here, you'll never find out who did this to her. Drop 'em!<eos> Not happening.<eos> Easy.<eos> Jesus, Miller.<eos> What the hell you got yourself into?<eos> Ain't no way I can clean all this up.<eos> - You got that right.<eos> - We're not asking you to do anything.
- You weren't here.<eos> I heard he was doing consulting work for the shipyards, which I took as a good sign.<eos> That make you feel better about betraying him?<eos> There was no consulting work.<eos> I found out he was paying for those trips himself.<eos> He was ashamed of sitting around the house, so I played along.<eos> I let him keep his pride.<eos> It was the only thing he had left.<eos> He had you.<eos> He loved you more than anything.
Towalda supposed to go to shelter.<eos> Hey!<eos> You go quiet and go now, else we throw you in there, ourselves.<eos> Help me up. My neck.<eos> Come on.<eos> Here's your problem, asshole.<eos> That just made me feel better.<eos> Turn around.<eos> My name is Frederick Lucius Johnson.<eos> Many of you know me, one way or another.

we crack down hard on ceres and the opa, and then we expose the truth and nail Fred Johnson to it.<eos> I always liked this side of you.<eos> The secretary-general's convening an emergency meeting with our key contractors to discuss security, and you need to join us.<eos> Of course.<eos> Ah, there you are.<eos> Right on time as usual.<eos> Admiral.<eos> Sir.<eos> Chrisjen avasarala, i trust you remember Jules-Pierre mao.<eos> It's a pleasure to see you again, madame.
We're going to our ship.<eos> Komwitmilowda, we have room.<eos> You can't get to docks that way.<eos> Tunnels all blocked.<eos> You come with us.<eos> There's a hospital on level nine.<eos> Her uncle is a doctor there.<eos> Whatever it is, it's not a sickness.<eos> It's something else.<eos> We can get you off this station.
Let's go rage, Dee.<eos> Hang on a second.<eos> I-I'm, like, so lost.<eos> So, uh, who do I go with in this situation?<eos> Well, that depends, Charlie.<eos> You could go drink cheap beer amongst swine and savages, like you would on any other day, or... you could get the most out of this mountain.<eos> And you could get the most out of yourself by joining an elite class of athletes and gentlemen alike.<eos> Right, Frank? Yes. Huh.<eos> That sounds kind of cool.<eos> All right, you guys go-- why should I go with you?
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Brave.<eos> Brave, bravissime.<eos> Very clever, indeed.<eos> Mark me... if I had a wife,<eos> I'd buy all three... for variety.<eos> You ask me, the French are a sorry bunch of sodomites that canna please their women.<eos> Forgive me. I do not recall asking your opinion nor inviting you here this evening.
Please don't.<eos> Then calm yourself.<eos> Your innocence is safe with us.<eos> Mary, allow me to introduce a fellow Englishwoman, Lady Broch Tuarach, Claire Fraser.<eos> M-Mary Hawkins, Madame.<eos> Mary Hawkins?<eos> I'm sure I've heard that name before somewhere.<eos> I don't believe we've met.<eos> Mm. Well, it will come to me, somehow.<eos> And what brings you to Paris, Mary?
Oh, a man of rather gross sensibilities.<eos> But fear not, if he is here, I shall find him.<eos> _<eos> Annalise.<eos> Claire... _<eos> Annalise de Marrilac.<eos> Annalise... _<eos> Claire Fraser.<eos> Charmed, I'm sure.<eos> Let me congratulate you on having won such a strong, passionate man for a husband.
That was the Minister of Finance.<eos> Monsieur Duverney?<eos> The very same.<eos> I tried to tell you, but it all happened so fast.<eos> Paris.<eos> I told you that dress would bring us grief.<eos> Please, accept my most fervent apology for my beastly behavior.<eos> Minister Duverney, I'm happy to accept your gracious apology.<eos> As am I.<eos> Thank you both, most sincerely.
Please, accept my most fervent apology for my beastly behavior.<eos> Minister Duverney, I'm happy to accept your gracious apology.<eos> As am I.<eos> Thank you both, most sincerely.<eos> What can I say? I've grown too fond of The King's ever-flowing champagne.<eos> If my wife had caught me attempting to make love to yet another woman...<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> My beloved possesses a fiery temper.<eos> Well, she need never know.<eos> - God's blessing on you both. - Mm.
Never draw your weapon in the presence of the King.<eos> It is death.<eos> _<eos> If that's an apology, and I do hope it is, I accept with all good grace.<eos> Jamie, dear boy, upon my word, I'm delighted to see you looking so healthy.<eos> Ah, Mrs. Fraser, what a joyful reunion.<eos> I wish I could say the same.<eos> You cut me to the quick.<eos> But I suppose I deserve it.<eos> Let me assure you, I had every intention of delivering that Petition of Complaint to The Court of Sessions, as I had pledged to do.
I must have a case.<eos> Hmm. How much?<eos> I'd be willing to pay 20% over the asking price.<eos> Sold.<eos> On credit, no doubt.<eos> Jamie, why don't you take Murtagh to have a drink with our new friend, the Minister of Finance?<eos> I see you're already cultivating important people in high places.<eos> How very in keeping with your character.<eos> Poor Jamie, he must be missing Scotland terribly.<eos> I suppose it's no longer a safe haven for either of you.
You have a keen eye, Daniel.<eos> Your colleagues must think so too.<eos> That's right, they do.<eos> But Mr Maltard is giving me grief.<eos> Forget about him, Daniel.<eos> Life is full of Mr Maltards.<eos> It is men like you who will build the future.<eos> - Thank you, Mr...<eos> - Everything all right?<eos> Very good, thank you.
I haven't given it back, that's all.<eos> You're setting a bad example.<eos> Don't worry, it's no big deal.<eos> What's so special about this hat?<eos> It makes me feel better.<eos> Stronger.<eos> Stronger how?<eos> Show me.<eos> The Board meeting is now open.<eos> Over to you, Mrs Lariviére.
Too bad you want to keep Sogetec in the past.<eos> Too bad you don't see computers are the future.<eos> While our competitors change, invent and innovate, we...<eos> Well, we verify.<eos> We...<eos> We make sure, we stall, we improve. But we don't create.<eos> You see, Mr Maltard, I allowed myself to dream. I dreamt we were the first to invest in IT.<eos> I dreamt we created a network.<eos> Not only to hold meetings, but also to reach our customers, to connect with our partners and our allies, and to keep an eye on our rivals.<eos> Mr Maltard, I beseech you, if you want Sogetec to succeed, you need to move with the times or else we'll all fall behind.
- You're soaked.<eos> - You're an angel, Maria.<eos> - Mr Aslan.<eos> - Yes?<eos> I'm spending July 14th with my sister.<eos> Everything's ready, come see.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Let me get you a dry shirt.<eos> Happy July 14th, senior Aslan.<eos> Thank you, Maria, same to you.
Right, muchas gracias.<eos> Thank you, Maria, thank you.<eos> I'm not sure I got all that, but thank you.<eos> Have a good evening, senior Aslan.<eos> Maybe I'll go dancing.<eos> I'll get that hat dry.<eos> Thank you!<eos> - Hello, Mr President.<eos> - Hello, Mr Mourousi.<eos> I'm happy to welcome you today along with the millions of viewers who in a moment will watch and listen to us.
All the same you haven't said a word about my concert.<eos> I don't commune with the angels, I love them.<eos> Fine words for fine thoughts!<eos> Maria!<eos> Could you please answer the door?<eos> She isn't here, today's her day off.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> No, Mr Mercier.<eos> Twice you've come.<eos> And twice I've asked you to leave me alone.

I doubt you've read Machiavelli.<eos> I hear you're battling to put down a strike.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Are you afraid of the people?<eos> You're a fossil, Larnier.<eos> Stay buried. Bernard!<eos> In olden days we'd have a field duel.<eos> - Colonel!<eos> - You're right.<eos> Asses like you belong in the fields.
- You are joking?<eos> - Not at all.<eos> We're going there now.<eos> I wanted you with me.<eos> - I'll introduce you.<eos> - Introduce me?<eos> It's my factory! By the way, I'm going to learn all of Edith Piaf's songs.<eos> Come inside, Milord...<eos> You're going to ruin us!<eos> Thank you for coming, Mr Lavalliére.
Come inside, Milord...<eos> You're going to ruin us!<eos> Thank you for coming, Mr Lavalliére.<eos> Call me Bernard.<eos> You know Charlotte, my wife.<eos> - Ready?<eos> - After you.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Come, dear.<eos> After you, Santelli.
We were here nine years ago.<eos> That's how old I am.<eos> - Give it.<eos> - Stop!<eos> - Stop! - No.<eos> Stop it now.<eos> Thank you. Good day.<eos> Allow me to present myself:<eos> Paul Lefort, Elysée presidential staff.<eos> I saw you on St Mark's Square and I noticed your hat.
Indiana Jones, Mr President.<eos> ' Dam . $6?<eos> 30?<eos> - He knew from the start.<eos> - Knew what?<eos> He knows the whole story.<eos> You were going barmy over that hat.<eos> I'll show you barmy!<eos> You're both barmy!<eos> He's expecting you.
Miss, would you like to know something?<eos> On the sea, boats pass by each other all the time<eos> Coming and going.<eos> Someone to meet you, someone to give money.<eos> Where's the furthest place you've been to?<eos> Is it behind the mountain?<eos> I think if this were to continue, it would be amazing.<eos> Being by your side.<eos> You're very lucky Miss.<eos> Not only do men like you, But also have the ability to protect you.
They'll only do a couple tests<eos> We'll eat lambchops tonight at the Peace Hotel<eos> We're almost done, you have worked hard.<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> Hello Miss.<eos> Do you still remember me?<eos> Miss.<eos> What are you people doing?<eos> We aren't harming you Miss.<eos> But taking care of you.
From today onwards, you shall sleep here.<eos> Why?<eos> Help me light the lamp.<eos> We have to conserve oil.<eos> What an annoying brat.<eos> Speak Japanese!<eos> In there, is a demon... what he hates the most... are obnoxious brats.<eos> If you continue to pester, he will come out.<eos> And what will happen after that?<eos> Use his huge body to press on you Miss.
Especially the endscene<eos> With such aristocrats...<eos> Why?<eos> Is it possible to imitate other's paintings?<eos> I believe in my craftsmanship.<eos> I'm very good at these types of things.<eos> Often pouring wine for women around me.<eos> To create a happy vibe.<eos> Even an expert wouldn't be able to tell.<eos> The Mistress of this house... can she get near you, Count?
It's the other way around; the Japanese are ugly, and Koreans are pretty.<eos> Simplicity has its own beauty.<eos> Because Koreans are weak, stupid...<eos> So it's not possible.<eos> That goes for Sasaki as well.<eos> Really?<eos> I only need to talk about suitable things And she will not wear undergarments as she knocks on my bedroom door.<eos> We think very much alike.<eos> And who is that?<eos> That very same person will reject you.

Hot.<eos> That's how I feel.<eos> What fire?<eos> I'm a cold-hearted Mistress, Count.<eos> He's going to come back soon.<eos> Yanshu calling... is because I wanted to talk to you alone about something.<eos> I want to talk about your future.<eos> I will be waiting at the lamppost at midnight.<eos> Yanshu is a fool.<eos> There's a maid sleeping behind you.
I will be waiting at the lamppost at midnight.<eos> Yanshu is a fool.<eos> There's a maid sleeping behind you.<eos> I don't want you to be tied in a scandal.<eos> I saw Keiko carrying pillows and leaving already.<eos> You don't think about the face you have as an aristocrat?<eos> I am not an aristocrat.<eos> I'm not even Japanese.<eos> What do you think I came here for?<eos> I have heard many rumors about you within my 15 years of living in Japan.

To a place no one knows.
Its ok if Sook-Hee reads this letter<eos> She's illiterate and cannot read.<eos> Can you help me read this?<eos> This is your name.<eos> You don't even know your own name?<eos> What happened to your foot?<eos> Who was it?<eos> Who took Tamako's shoe.<eos> Apologize to her in front of all the maids later.<eos> If she leaves because of you people, you will be stripped naked and thrown out.
Even a professional jeweler could hardly tell the difference<eos> Is that so?<eos> I'm returning the earrings I borrowed from you.<eos> Women love to play with fate.<eos> She always takes the earrings and tries them on as she looks in the mirror.<eos> I feel that Sook-Hee will do her best.<eos> She won't be suspicious about us.<eos> Until the day comes, don't let Sook-Hee find out.<eos> Let her do her best to help you fall in love with me.<eos> She do any and everything to persuade you.
Miss.<eos> It would've been better if I was never born.<eos> To have never taken a breath and live.<eos> Let go.<eos> Miss, I was wrong.<eos> You won't let go?<eos> Miss, I was wrong.<eos> Don't kill yourself, it was my fault.<eos> And where were you wrong?<eos> It was me who dragged you into this mess, convincing you to marry that bastard.

You've already taught me Japanese alphabet.<eos> That son of a bitch painted this didn't he.<eos> This is what he's been doing the entire time?<eos> For those dirty old men?<eos> When a nobleman's daughter is back from being in public, she uses straw to make a coat her child is also a thief, a conman,<eos> the one that saves me.<eos> My Tamako.<eos> My Sook-Hee<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Damn you all, bastards!
Isa? Isa, you in there?<eos> -Open, open!<eos> Open, open, open!<eos> Open!<eos> I'm getting married!<eos> He finally proposed!<eos> - OK, you ready partner?<eos> - Yeah, OK.<eos> Let's get this over with.<eos> Well, our main concern is for you.
The guys, um... they had a little cake, you know, and a little something for me down at the station.<eos> It was... It was real nice.<eos> OK, um... go back to sleep, huh.<eos> - I love you. - Good night, Dad.<eos> - I love you, too.<eos> - OK, good night.<eos> Good night, pal.<eos> Olga.<eos> Olga, Olga... Olga.<eos> It's so good to see you.
Is that it?<eos> Well, your stopper, it's rotted around the edges, so it's not making a seal,<eos> The water is going to drip through into the bowl.<eos> I could bring you a new one tomorrow, or you might want to consider replacing the whole apparatus.<eos> What do you recommend?<eos> I could replace the stopper first.<eos> If that doesn't work, I could replace the whole apparatus.<eos> You can't give me a professional recommendation?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's really up to you.
Yeah, I did.<eos> You think they have a shot?<eos> No.<eos> Not one.<eos> Dropped the first two, they're going to lose the next three.<eos> Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.<eos> That's okay.<eos> Did I get you?<eos> Yes.<eos> I got you.
I got you.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Let me get you some napkins.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Hey, Lenny, can I grab some napkins?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Here.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Well, now I spilled my beer all over you, my name's Sharon.
♪ Clear up to the sky ♪<eos> ♪ Well I say oh ♪<eos> ♪ What a beautiful mornin' ♪<eos> ♪ I've got a beautiful feelin' ♪<eos> ♪ Everything ♪<eos> ♪ Everything's goin' my way ♪ How you doing?<eos> How you doing?<eos> I'm good.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Hey, can I ask you, guys, do you know me?
Betheny.<eos> Betheny, I'm sorry.<eos> I can never get it right.<eos> Not a problem.<eos> So... you were saying.<eos> It's a gradual deterioration of the muscles of the heart.<eos> It's usually associated with older people, but in rare cases it will occur in a younger person.<eos> Some people live up to 50 or 60 years with just an occasional attack, but most people suffer periodic episodes, like the one you had on Monday.<eos> Which mimic the symptoms of a heart attack in which further weaken the muscle.<eos> They can put you out of commission for e week, two weeks, and you'll need to be hospitalized so that we can monitor your heart because the risk of cardiac arrest is elevated for a week or two.
And, uh, that's it.<eos> Log must've rolled out onto the floor.<eos> And the firemen said they pulled Randi out.<eos> She was passed out downstairs.<eos> And... Then the furnace blew, and they couldn't go back in again.<eos> And that's all I remember.<eos> Okay, Lee.<eos> That's all for now.<eos> We'll call you if anything else comes up we want to ask you about.<eos> Assuming the forensics bail you out, which I'm assuming they will...
- You the father?<eos> - Yes.<eos> We found your number in this phone, and there's no I.D. on the body, so we just need somebody to identify the body.<eos> Ready?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just wanted to check in, make sure you're okay.<eos> You all right?<eos> This must all be really overwhelming for you, so just let me know if you need anything, okay?
The transport data is all wrong.<eos> Many more people work there.<eos> You can't cut enough staff there.<eos> The good news is:<eos> Henneberg wants you to do the math on the radical cut.<eos> Yes, I eat fruit.<eos> But that is totally unfounded.<eos> Surely you realized it was all on the verge of speculation.<eos> Above all, to sell such a big restructuring I really need precise figures.<eos> This will annoy the feminist in you. To quote Henneberg: "Ms. Conradi has enough charm to manage Illiescu by herself."

- In which embassy you work.<eos> - In the German...<eos> Uh, in the German.<eos> I am Ambassador Erdmann.<eos> And this is my... Secretary.<eos> Miss Schnuck.<eos> - What are you doing with that guy?<eos> - He's amusing.<eos> Is it okay?<eos> Welcome, I saw you in the in the restaurant thing.
Do you mind giving me a pen?<eos> I'm sorry, I'm not so well prepared.<eos> First of all..<eos> I'm looking forward that the project is going to continue.<eos> So am I, so am I.<eos> And that we will work more closer together than we did so far.<eos> Which is a pleasure. - Yes it is.<eos> As you know, I presented your figures at our last steering company.<eos> Unfortunately, a lot of questions came up about some of the data you provided.<eos> So I defended your work since I know that the things we ask you to deliver are complicated.
Painting was very interesting. - Thank you.<eos> Maybe we can sing a song for you?<eos> And for your family?<eos> Just to say thank you<eos> Why not?<eos> Okay, that would be nice.<eos> I will arrange here.<eos> For once, let's finish something politely.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen...<eos> My secretary And I sing a song for you.
Oh.<eos> Yeah, she came to this beach when she kind of... she was pregnant with me.<eos> I've never been but...<eos> It's kind of our beach.<eos> That's my little sister.<eos> Are there more photos?<eos> Um.<eos> You want to see more photos?<eos> I can...<eos> If you look only at the phone, you're missing what is around you.
Get in line, buddy.<eos> Just keep it elevated, ma'am.<eos> Someone's coming.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're going to be fine.<eos> 5 HOURS TO LOW TIDE<eos> There we go.<eos> I got to get some blood flowing.<eos> Now, let's loosen this tourniquet for you.
Help!<eos> - Come on, I got you!<eos> - Help!<eos> I got you!<eos> I got you!<eos> I got you!<eos> Come on.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Huh.<eos> Someone got you.
Is he gonna come in the house with this gun?<eos> Is he gonna come in the house with this gun?<eos> Fuck!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Hello?<eos> Yes, may I speak to John aloysius mccain of 550 maple Avenue, please?<eos> I'm sorry, sir, but I'm on disability and I can't give you any money.<eos> Oh, that's okay, sir.<eos> We're not looking for any donations.<eos> I just wanna get to know you somewhat.
Not a great job, but diesel dug it.<eos> Help.<eos> You have to understand, diesel is a big lug nut looking dude, but he's very bright.<eos> In another universe, this guy could've been a lawyer from Stanford or something.<eos> Unfortunately, we're not in that universe.<eos> There's always something they use.<eos> Your parole officer, your counseling.<eos> Say cheese.<eos> This asshole cop I knew planted 28 grams of coke on me.<eos> An ounce, not a lot, but it was packaged for sale, which is the part that fucks you.
And so, with the drug beef piled up on top of the attempted violent escape, it was a five to 15 year hit.<eos> We all did our piece at different times, and I was the last to come out,<eos> so these chaps decided to throw me a welcome home party.<eos> You know what's funny in there?<eos> What you know that's out here and what you don't know, like Facebook, come on.<eos> We were fuckin' Facebook friends before there was a Facebook.<eos> But the red fucking jeans that hug the element's leg,<eos> I had no clue.<eos> Get the fuck outta my business.<eos> Should I take care of this guy for you?
Face the car, put your hands behind your head.<eos> I ain't even did nothin', man.<eos> Well, computer says you have some outstanding traffic warrants.<eos> Oh, that's bullshit!<eos> Hey, hey, call Evie, man, tell her to come bail me out this motherfucker.<eos> Hey, old rich nigga.<eos> You done shoulda paid your tickets!<eos> Shut your old ass up.<eos> All right, shut the fuck up and get in the car.<eos> Evie can't do nothin' for you now, man.
If not, I'm gonna blow your backbone outta your belly, period.<eos> You copy?<eos> Look, man, I don't know what...<eos> Oh, fuck!<eos> Motherfucker, you got blood on my versace!<eos> - Oh, yeah, I feel you.<eos> - Goddamn it!<eos> Versace.<eos> Let me...<eos> let me clean you up.
Y'all see this shit, right?<eos> Shut up.<eos> - Tell him to open up.<eos> - Hey!<eos> Hey, dude, it's me.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Tell him we won't bust him if he opens up.<eos> He ain't gonna believe that shit.<eos> Just humor me, tell him anyway.<eos> He said he wasn't gonna bust you if you open the door.
- Get up, bro!<eos> - What did I say?<eos> - Where is it?<eos> It's upstairs!<eos> I said it was upstairs!<eos> - Let me waste a couple.<eos> - Don't!<eos> - You tryin' to fake me out?<eos> - No, I promise!<eos> I'm not fuckin' you around.
Listen, please.<eos> I'm not a violent person.<eos> No, I understand that, I know.<eos> I just...<eos> I don't feel safe right now.<eos> And I don't feel safe and I have to leave now.<eos> Let's do this again real soon.<eos> Well, hey, I enjoyed the shit out of certain things.<eos> I wanna just honestly express my gratitude to you, Troy, for hookin' this little adventure up.<eos> Oh, boy, the butterin' up's underway to hit you up to loan him some money to buy somethin', Troy.
I got two strikes.<eos> Well, we all have two strikes so I think we are agreed that that cannot happen.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - I think we all understand that there's no way we're gonna get a foot in the straight world without some serious dough with which to start businesses with, and we aren't gonna get that by being some $10-an-hour monkey<eos> in a job we got from our probation officer or an outreach program<eos> - or what have you.<eos> - Aw, shit, you can't live off that shit.<eos> - So this seems to be the play.<eos> But I just wanna say this, and I'm not tryin' to be melodramatic.<eos> I am looking out for you.
- I know.<eos> - He didn't, doesn't...<eos> - I know that.<eos> Now listen to me.<eos> - Hey, hey!<eos> - Carmen!<eos> Hey!<eos> - You don't wanna go up there.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because your husband had one of his thugs watching' you, and he got shot.
I have a number for him in canton.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Canton is good, that's a start.<eos> Now I need ya to call him, tell him his kid's collateral on money he owes an old friend from prison, and as soon as he pays it, he gets the kid back, okay?<eos> Carmen!<eos> Lady!<eos> I don't have time for this shit.<eos> All right, did you get your phone charged?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Okay, good, 'cause we're gonna call you in a little bit, so keep it charged.

She wants the worst thing to happen.<eos> Well, she took it to that place, and that was it.<eos> What about the kid?<eos> And the kid, the kid too, the fucking kid.<eos> That kid, I can't stand it.<eos> Jesus Christ, are you kiddin' me, with a mother like that?<eos> You're not gonna judge me?<eos> Dis!<eos> I mean, i...<eos> I looked to you to be a friend.
Somethin' about me not keepin' my foot locker locked.<eos> So you know this place?<eos> Yeah, it was shut down since I was maybe 25.<eos> Just go to the left.<eos> - Over there?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I got a key.<eos> Tomorrow, clean slate.<eos> End of all of this shit.<eos> So can I just ask you, and I want you to be frank 'cause I really do respect you.
No, no, trust me, we gotta go up there and place him in.<eos> You said absolutely nobody fucking comes here, man.<eos> You're right, but in a billion in a chance that one does, we want that person to be invisible, like, stuck under, like, six or seven things.<eos> In a couple of days, they're gonna be rotting' anyway, and then it's too late, but don't do 'em any favors.<eos> - Use your head.<eos> - In here?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Dude, seriously, you're gonna get fuckin' aids in here, man.<eos> Aw, shit, bro, haven't you ever done sanitation?<eos> It's a fuckin' fact in forensic science that things begin to rot, they're at their least toxic for you because they are structurally bent on their own self-destruction because, well, it's like an organism.
So, I just wanna...<eos> I wanna, you know, sit down, and I want you to give me five things, five character flaws that I can do a reboot on.<eos> - You know, a do-over on... amend my character flaws, as it were.<eos> Like, you know, I mean, just sit down and really go with candor, whether it's my fuckin' mother's fault or my father's fault, it doesn't really matter.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Oh, god.<eos> Oh shit, fuck.<eos> Oh, you know, it doesn't really make any difference because I'm willin' to alter those things because I believe in redemption, right?<eos> And I'm willin' to do that.<eos> I warned you, dog.
What happened?<eos> That's what we're trying to figure out.<eos> You can be helpful.<eos> Maybe we could go sit somewhere and talk, if that's all right.<eos> Where's your tie?<eos> I don't have a tie.<eos> You cheated a lot of people, Mr. Gerwitz, and you did it with a smile and a handshake.<eos> I'll never live it down, Judge. And I'll never stop trying to make amends.<eos> Eh, someone pass me a hankie.<eos> I'm sentencing you to 18 months in the Franklin Correctional Facility.
I like to read.<eos> Yeah, but that shit?<eos> Do you see "arraignment"?<eos> Mr. Khan, how are you?<eos> I'm going crazy.<eos> I understand. I'm a father myself.<eos> And I'm sorry to intrude. This is a court order allowing us to search the house.<eos> For what?<eos> May we come in?<eos> Mrs. Khan, nice to see you.
Bail set at 500.<eos> That's a 100 an 8-ball. Sound fair?<eos> Jimmy, next time, tell your client to leave his tomahawk at home.<eos> Where'd you have to go for this one?<eos> Paris.<eos> You're kidding me.<eos> Toccoa fucking Georgia.<eos> Next.<eos> 43562, Nasir Khan.<eos> Which one of you is him?
God is in our wine.<eos> It can do you no harm.<eos> Father, Ali Khan does not take alcohol.<eos> It's against his religion.<eos> On this occasion, I will make an exception so I can toast Prince Kipiani.<eos> Thank you, young man.<eos> Prince Kipiani. Prince Kipiani.<eos> You must go and look at our gardens after dinner, Ali Khan.<eos> We have the most beautiful ancient trees.<eos> Thank you, Your Highness, but I came to visit you, not your trees.
The revolution in Russia has caused chaos everywhere!<eos> The Russians may have gone, but we are still in danger.<eos> Brothers, come closer, please.<eos> I want to make the situation clear to you.<eos> Our town is surrounded by deserters from the czar's armies.<eos> They're going village to village killing everyone in their path.<eos> They've set fire to the oil fields and are almost upon us, desperate and resolved to loot and destroy our houses, rape our women.<eos> They outnumber us!<eos> And we have fewer weapons.<eos> I ask you to join us to defend our homes and keep the enemy from our door!

They've commandeered trains. They're on their way to Baku.<eos> - It's time to leave.<eos> - All right.<eos> We have to go.<eos> Prime Minister.<eos> I've just been informed that the Bolsheviks are gaining on us.<eos> We'll make sure you escape across the border.<eos> We'll do whatever it takes to hold them off.<eos> Sir.<eos> Ilyas, I have known you for a very long time, and you have proved your great courage.

( roars )<eos> ( roars )<eos> I'm friends with your mother.<eos> ( roaring )<eos> I'm here to help.<eos> Don't eat the help.<eos> ( chuckles nervously )<eos> ( roaring )<eos> When I was a child, an uncle asked what gift I wanted for my name day.<eos> I begged him for one of you.
Can it be done?<eos> There are some with this power.<eos> - How?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Have you seen it done?<eos> I met a man who came back from the dead, but the priest who did it-- it shouldn't have been possible.<eos> But it was.<eos> It could be now.<eos> Not for me.<eos> Not for you?
Yes, Magdalena has been chosen messenger for the entire region.<eos> You know what, Magdalena?<eos> You have a light in your heart, just like your mom and dad.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> - Goodnight.<eos> It was lovely to see you again.<eos> I feel blessed.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Yes, thanks, and safe travels.<eos> May God bless you and the children.
Where's it coming from?<eos> I don't know.<eos> A factory maybe...<eos> A road, I don't know.<eos> Just this continuous... metal-sounding noise outside.<eos> Can you hear it?<eos> - What?<eos> Can you heart it now?<eos> Yes.<eos> The man who took you.
- Have you checked the cars?<eos> Where the hell are you, Carl?<eos> There.<eos> The convertible.<eos> It's not registered to any of the staff.<eos> We have a registration number.<eos> YJ 47 512.<eos> Mia Hansen.<eos> The address is half an hour away.<eos> Okay. We want all of you to listen to this.
They're bringing in polygraphs.<eos> - We still okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You don't got to pay my rent no more if you don't want to.<eos> Take me back.<eos> As per usual, I see some old faces here.<eos> Glad you learned your lesson.<eos> For the freshmen, I'll keep it simple.<eos> You get told to do something, you do it.<eos> You lay a hand on any one of us, we will break out the riot gear, put you in the fucking hospital, and add another charge.
So you, husbandless, childless, and in terror of losing the job you've devoted your life to, do what you know you have to do, what any woman over the age of 40 who deals with the public<eos> to earn a living has to do, what a reporter who works for Channel 7 News, before you know it, will have to do.<eos> So was it voluntary?<eos> You tell me.<eos> Put all prohibited items in the lockers.<eos> weapons, cell phones, belts, keys key rings, nail clippers,pens, pencils...<eos> Good.<eos> Next.<eos> Arms out, please.<eos> Pat you down.
The cab was used in the commission of a crime, which means the state can sue in order to keep it in a civil court.<eos> Sue?<eos> Sue who?<eos> You, the registered owners.<eos> But the suit won't get filed until the criminal trial and however many months that'll take, which I could have told you over the phone if you'd have called first.<eos> - Months?<eos> - Or longer.<eos> Slow wheels of justice and all.<eos> And I hate to say it, but you'll probably lose in civil court.<eos> Unless, uh... which of you is Khan?
He already said something about that to us, and I said, "What?<eos> Plead?"<eos> Well, that's because he doesn't want to be in a courtroom any more than a courtroom wants him in it.<eos> Mr. Stone is not a trial lawyer. He's barely a lawyer.<eos> He wants his fee, wants things over fast, and then onto the next case, which works for him, but does it work for his clients?<eos> Well, they'll never know. They're in jail.<eos> I didn't get a good feeling from this man.<eos> You have good instincts.<eos> And your son deserves better than someone who's never tried a murder case.<eos> Did he ask you to sign anything?
I got some good news.<eos> Since the last time, I decided to jump back into the dating pool.<eos> How's that going for you?<eos> I got to tell you, I'm holding my own.<eos> That's not exactly the best choice of words there, Steve.<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> More power to you, brother.<eos> - And how you doing, John? - Me?<eos> You know, I'm holding my own.<eos> He drug you down the street by your hair and brought you back to the house, and you're pregnant.
I put a lot of thought into it, especially this final tune as it will be the last song you'll ever hear.<eos> Tough choice.<eos> And then I thought, George Clinton!<eos> The king of interplanetary funkmanship.<eos> George's psychedelic rock will leave you feeling funky, obviously.<eos> And soulful, which is the least I can do.<eos> Now, we played a lot of Purge games tonight, and we have just one more.<eos> It's simple, yet effective.<eos> It's called "Mommy's Choice."<eos> Mommy, which one of you will survive this year's Purge?
Joe.<eos> Mira.<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> Where's he going?<eos> I never saw him move so damn fast.<eos> All right, girls, give it up. I won't have to call the police.<eos> Get outta my face, old man!<eos> Let's not do this the hard way, okay?<eos> I'm giving you an out.<eos> All right, give up the candy or I'll have to take it away from you.
That makes me proud.<eos> Now give back whatever you stole.<eos> And apologize.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Sorry, mister.<eos> I was just playin'.<eos> So, Ms. Rucker, what happened to you?<eos> You look all whitish now.<eos> Later, Ms. Rucker.<eos> Wish I met you back in the day.
You're my family, Joe.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> Thank you, Laney.<eos> I want men in there.<eos> I want men in there.<eos> I want a lot of men back there.<eos> She's got some security, but I'm revamping the entire thing.<eos> We got new barricades on all the doors, all the windows back and front.<eos> Looks safe.<eos> Chief, if you tell me it's safe one more time, I'm gonna throw you down the steps.
You said you had men on the roof. You have snipers.<eos> - Not anymore. Not anymore.<eos> - What do you mean, not anymore?<eos> - Someone betrayed us.<eos> - What?<eos> I can't trust anyone.<eos> Put on that vest.<eos> Listen to me!<eos> This isn't a drill.<eos> Someone's coming to kill you.
Purge victim removal and disposal.<eos> Keep Washington clean.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Death collection haul.<eos> This is how it's gonna go now.<eos> Like you said, fate of the country's at stake.<eos> Okay? It's my show now.<eos> Look, I'm not an idiot.<eos> I know what you're capable of.<eos> I'm the one who hired you.
Thirty-five yards back, 15 yards up.<eos> Down!<eos> Reason I'm so hard on you, son, like I am is someday I'd like to make you a partner.<eos> Yep. Oh, boy.<eos> Coming here from another country like you did.<eos> Having your own business.<eos> American dream is still alive.<eos> We love you, America.<eos> America is the greatest country in the world.<eos> We are gonna kill you.
Remove your skin and share in your blood.<eos> This is the American way.<eos> Senator.<eos> Come with us.<eos> - Stay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, this is my place.<eos> You can stay all night if you want to.<eos> Now, I got to ask you 'cause I'm just a nosey old dog.
The looters I was telling you about.<eos> Purge Night, Senator.<eos> What did you expect?<eos> Hey, you old fuck!<eos> I'm back.<eos> And I brought some friends.<eos> And I'm gonna get that candy bar.<eos> They have chainsaws and they're coming inside.<eos> All right.<eos> I got to get you outta here.
I'm gonna call in and tell them we have a special guest.<eos> Where are we?<eos> You'll see.<eos> What is this place?<eos> We call this a Safe Zone.<eos> - Senator, Dante Bishop.<eos> - Mr. Bishop.<eos> This is Angel.<eos> Dawn called. Told me you guys were coming through.<eos> So the NFFA came at you tonight?
Yes, this is my organization.<eos> We have doctors, and nurses, EMTs, paramedics.<eos> This is their way of protesting this damn night.<eos> How many people know about this place?<eos> Just the volunteers, and the homeless that we invite in.<eos> Look, these are the real victims of the Purge.<eos> The people that the NFFA are trying to eliminate so that they don't have to take care of them anymore.<eos> These men that are armed, you'll have them at all the entrances and the rooftop?<eos> Yes.<eos> My men will keep you safe.
The man liked to have escape tunnels attached to all his structures.<eos> They're all over D.C.<eos> The tunnel under the original church has been closed up since the '50s.<eos> But we reopened it.<eos> We're gonna walk right through there and into that church without anybody even knowing it.<eos> The original Founding Fathers are about to fuck over the New Founding Fathers.<eos> Now how you like that for irony?<eos> How do you know where this mass is gonna be?<eos> Because we do whatever it takes.<eos> We did this for you, Senator.
We do.<eos> That's why we're trying to pave a way for you to the White House so you can make changes.<eos> You're gonna cost me the White House.<eos> It's Laney.<eos> She says there's trucks approaching us.<eos> What?<eos> Who is that?<eos> Government soldiers.<eos> That's the NFFA eliminating all their enemies this year.<eos> They're here for Bishop, but they will kill you.
So what we supposed to be, like some superheroes or something?<eos> That ain't what I do.<eos> I hate this night!<eos> Ah, shit.<eos> Hell with it.<eos> Come on. Shit.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Let's go get 'em.<eos> I can't believe we're outside again.<eos> I'm gonna get you through this.
I would like all the Founding Fathers to come to the altar.<eos> Join me, brothers, as we eliminate evil<eos> There is a fountain filled with blood<eos> Drawn from Immanuel's veins<eos> And sinners, plunged beneath that flood<eos> Lose all their guilty stains<eos> Lord of Air, Lord of Earth, we ask that you receive this child into your loving arms.<eos> We are sinners.<eos> Let us release.<eos> Caleb, our leader, I invite you, sir, to lead us in this Purging as you have and as you will.
Oh, my God.<eos> You murderous pig.<eos> I am gonna beat the shit out of you on election day.<eos> I'm not as politically correct as the Senator.<eos> Good night, blue cheese.<eos> Well played, Leo.<eos> Thanks, Joe.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> No, I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> We have to get you out of there.
Everything moves towards its end.<eos> And the closer we get to ours, the louder that clock ticks, the less a sane man would let a promise deprive him of happiness.<eos> I explained all this to Mary, who told me she understood and that she would not protest our separation.<eos> Are you calling my sister a liar?<eos> Well... you're here.<eos> I can think of at least three lies she must have told you to bring that about.<eos> First, I imagine she told you I retired from a prosperous trade to settle with her here.<eos> But what she likely did not mention is that that trade was high seas piracy.<eos> Second, she told you my name was Drummond, but when I plied that trade, I was called Teach.<eos> And third, she clearly led you to believe that you could point your sword in my direction and survive the experience.
Martinique, Nevis... their magistrates hanged men for piracy.<eos> They all receive visits from me.<eos> The word went forth... any capital sentence served against a pirate would hear my answer.<eos> You must'a known.<eos> You must'a heard.<eos> And yet you chose to hang those three men in your square.<eos> Why?<eos> If I didn't... if I let my fear of you prevent me from enforcing the law, then civilization in this place is dead.<eos> I also know that most of those other magistrates you visited, they were corrupt men, dishonest men.<eos> I wagered that despite all I'd heard about you, your mercilessness, your cruelty, that you could tell the difference.
What you cannot know is where I come from, what I once was.<eos> If you knew that, I imagine you would've made different choices today.<eos> The evidence has been delivered.<eos> The accused has been measured.<eos> Now let us talk about judgment.<eos> Miss Guthrie, do you have anything to say in your defense before sentence is pronounced?<eos> I have but one regret that though the pirates of Nassau filled my purse with coin, I never took the opportunity to let them fill me with anything else.<eos> - I apologize.<eos> - Miss Guthrie...<eos> This must seem in such poor taste to you.
They are who they are, and someone must provide them with the things they need.<eos> Right now, this is what they need.<eos> ...found guilty of these and countless other crimes for which the sentence... is death.<eos> Any news from London?<eos> The trial is set to begin sometime next week.<eos> The spectacle around it is said to be so great, the king himself receives daily updates.<eos> Hmm. With that much attention on the politics in play, do you believe there is any way she will be offered some sort of clemency?<eos> I would think there is always a chance for mercy for one willing to beg for it.<eos> But I do not imagine you came to see our play.<eos> What is it I can do for you?
Flint was right about one thing.<eos> This is only the beginning.<eos> Something else is coming.<eos> Judge: "For years you lorded over the operations of hundreds, if not thousands, of hardened pirates.<eos> How exactly were you able to manage this?"<eos> Accused:<eos> "One day at a time, I suppose."<eos> I enjoyed that.<eos> There is a funny thing about notoriety, and I have a little experience with this.<eos> The more people know of you, the more of you those people feel belongs to them.
So you can imagine how difficult it was for me to arrange it so that I could say,<eos> "I am the one who set her free."<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> My name is Woodes Rogers, and I am the next governor of New Providence Island.<eos> Well, assuming I can subdue her.<eos> That is where you come in.<eos> I am to set sail for the West Indies in two days' time.<eos> I am prepared.<eos> But the one element I lack is knowledge, someone who understands Nassau and can help me know what I'm going to find there.<eos> If you agree to be that person for me, your sentence will be commuted and the charges against you released.

- My opposite, physically and intellectually.<eos> - You're such idiots!<eos> - Her former student, the writer.<eos> - Now I see.<eos> Quiet down!<eos> He's coming.<eos> - Hello. - Hello.<eos> You okay?<eos> Come in.<eos> - I won't bother you.
This cat is unbearable.<eos> What a pain. I really have to get rid of her.<eos> - Give her away.<eos> - To who?<eos> An old black cat. Obese, to boot.<eos> - Would you take her?<eos> - Not after that description.<eos> Elsa, Nathalie...<eos> and Clemens.<eos> - Fabien speaks highly of you.
Easy, easy.<eos> Easy.<eos> What do you remember?<eos> They stabbed me.<eos> Olly... he put a knife in my heart.<eos> I shouldn't be here.<eos> The lady brought you back.
The Citadel isn't Castle Black.<eos> I don't have a Jon Snow or Maester Aemon to help me bend the rules.<eos> I'll stay in Oldtown, then.<eos> By yourself?<eos> With a baby and no money?<eos> So if we're not going to Oldtown, where are you taking me?<eos> To my home.<eos> Horn Hill.<eos> My father's-- well, my father, but my mother's a kind woman and my sister's lovely.<eos> They'll take care of you both.
If you think it's for the best, we trust you.<eos> I'd feel better if you threw something at me and stormed off.<eos> I'd never do that to the father of my son.<eos> That's my father.<eos> The man beside him is Howland Reed, Meera's father.<eos> Ser Arthur Dayne.<eos> The Sword of the Morning.<eos> Father said he was the best swordsman he ever saw.<eos> Lord Stark.<eos> I looked for you on the Trident.
That's very good.<eos> But that's a report.<eos> I was thinking more of a conversation.<eos> A wise man once said the true history of the world is the history of great conversations in elegant rooms.<eos> Who said this?<eos> Me.<eos> Just now.<eos> All right, no conversations.<eos> Let's play a game.<eos> You don't play games, either one of you, ever?
When will it be possible?<eos> When she's fully atoned for her sins.<eos> You cut off her hair and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city.<eos> That wasn't the full atonement?<eos> No.<eos> She must stand trial before seven septons so we can learn the true extent of her sins.<eos> I want you to let her see Myrcella's resting place.<eos> I am the king.<eos> You are.<eos> And what does that mean to you?
Do you know who told me that?<eos> Your mother.<eos> My mother who is unclean?<eos> My mother who still needs to atone after all you've put her through?<eos> How do you think the Mother Above first came to us?<eos> How did men and women first come to feel the Mother's presence, hmm?<eos> It was through their own mothers.<eos> There's a great deal of falsehood in Cersei.<eos> You know that.<eos> But when she speaks of you, the Mother's love outshines it all.
You're right. I'm to be taken seriously.<eos> Oh, Steve, that really ties into what you were talking about earlier.<eos> The sign outside needs to be updated.<eos> And I say we just break the glass instead of continuing this preposterous 30-year search for the key.<eos> And I say the key is still out there.<eos> Agreed.<eos> We'll now hear the last of the community objections to the Arena Football stadium.<eos> First up is Old Man Hansen.<eos> Good people of Langley Falls,<eos> I ask you to join me in standing up to the no-good crooks on our city council.
I'm trying to talk here.<eos> We went to high school together!<eos> Let's get real, you guys.<eos> Do we even want this stadium?<eos> Arena Football is kind of lame.<eos> Mr. Smith, what is really going on here?<eos> It obviously has something to do with that tree.<eos> Now, come on. You can talk to us.<eos> We're your town council.<eos> We love you.
It's coming to the end of day 7 in --<eos> Oop, that weird Carconi brother who's always telling everyone he's an honorary firefighter is approaching the tree now.<eos> Well, Freddie says once the sun sets, we got to send the crew home.<eos> That means the stadium's dead and he's not gonna take me to Mountain Mike's Pizza.<eos> And it's the sauciest pizza.<eos> Oh, my sweet flesh family.<eos> Come, be with me in my hour of triumph.<eos> Honey, you've blown me away with your commitment to this hunger strike.<eos> It wasn't supposed to be a hunger strike.<eos> I kept asking you to bring me food.
Thank you all so very much.<eos> You know, years ago when I founded the Verdi Club,<eos> I never could have imagined that I would be here tonight, 25 years on, with my beloved husband by my side.<eos> Music...<eos> Music has been, and is, my life.<eos> Music matters.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Bravo!<eos> And at this dark moment in our history, with our brave boys fighting for civilisation itself, it matters more than ever.<eos> So I implore you to continue to support the musical life of this city.
- I do.<eos> They're all rather... heavy-handed, I'm afraid.<eos> The son of a bitch.<eos> Madam Florence regrets she is unable to hear any more candidates today.<eos> - It's unbelievable.<eos> - I trained at Juilliard...<eos> I am so very sorry.<eos> - Why?<eos> - You're not her type.<eos> Now, I must warn you, I work very hard.
- He sells meat in cans.<eos> - Very wealthy.<eos> Very generous.<eos> - Oh.<eos> I understand Agnes isn't a member. She's new to the world of classical music.<eos> But she's very keen to learn.<eos> Well, in that case, I think we can make an exception.<eos> - Four dollars, please.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> A whole world of pleasure awaits you, Mrs Stark.
There's an Earl Wilson here.<eos> Send him in.<eos> Thank you, Kitty.<eos> Through there.<eos> - Earl Wilson of the New York Post.<eos> - How do you do, Mr Bayfield?<eos> How do you do?<eos> I read your column. It's great fun.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - What brings you here?
I'm not sure it's an event that would interest the readers of the New York Post.<eos> My editor would disagree. There's quite a buzz around town about it.<eos> He sent me down here himself.<eos> So, can I get that ticket?<eos> Why not?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Voilà.<eos> I just need the ticket.<eos> It's both or neither, Mr Wilson.<eos> Then I'll trouble you no more.
- Thank you, madam.<eos> - Oh, Mr Bayfield.<eos> I don't hear very well, but I just think Madam Florence is magical.<eos> Well, I know how very grateful she is for your friendship and your support.<eos> - That little McMoon.<eos> - I'm so very sorry.<eos> Just one moment.<eos> - What a find.<eos> - St Clair, a delightful evening.<eos> The Donohughes, how nice to see you.
That you encouraged Mrs Jenkins to make a spectacle of herself is quite simply unforgivable.<eos> - Will you be writing something?<eos> - Yes, and it will be the truth.<eos> Isn't the truth that a lot of hurt people are having some fun?<eos> - Did you not notice?<eos> - Music is important.<eos> - It should not be mocked.<eos> - How dare you?<eos> She has done more for the musical life of this city than anyone.<eos> - And that includes you.
It looks like two Subway sandwiches.<eos> Go up.<eos> Next.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Just getting a feel for what's coming, John.<eos> You?<eos> You know, I live here.<eos> The people vs. Nasir Khan, indictment number 4157 OF 2014.<eos> Arraign the defendant.<eos> The grand jury of the state of New York has indicted you for the crimes of possession of a weapon for deadly purpose, resisting arrest, aggravated sexual assault in the first degree, and murder in the first degree.
Don't hurt me.<eos> I'll kill you, man!<eos> Please.<eos> Please.<eos> Please, just... let me walk.<eos> Let me walk.<eos> Leave me alive.<eos> Why do this, man.<eos> Please.<eos> How many of you are there?
Oh, Barbara, please don't start that nonsense about your thighs.<eos> Denny's here to take photographs.<eos> And we'll look much more stylish if we're wearing matching outfits.<eos> So, say goodnight to Tom, and go and get changed.<eos> You look as fresh as a daisy.<eos> It's amazing what a sponge-down and a nice nap can do.<eos> Can I have my little girl with me for visiting time?<eos> I want to show her to her dad.<eos> Baby's to stay in the nursery for tonight.<eos> She had a rather rough ride of it, just like you.
Oh. - I would rather you didn't look, Sister Julienne, but I'm happy to spell out the headlines for you.<eos> "Keeping Fit," exclamation mark.<eos> "Poplar Midwives Take Care Of All Aspects Of Health."<eos> Two photographs of Nurse Gilbert and Nurse Mount in their new uniforms and then two photographs of all of them cavorting in their combinations!<eos> Those aren't combinations, Sister.<eos> They're called leotards.<eos> Oh, Trixie!<eos> We aren't in the paper in our leotards...<eos> I'm afraid you are, Nurse Gilbert.<eos> Showing every outline that God gave you!
Showing every outline that God gave you!<eos> If God gave us those outlines, Sister, then I'm sure he won't object to them being on display.<eos> But, Nurse Franklin, I'm very much afraid we do.<eos> I think the problem is, the nappies are just too big.<eos> On a normal baby, the towelling comes halfway down the thighs. But Susan's feet keep getting caught.<eos> Can we try, er, cutting one up and hemming it?<eos> See if that works.<eos> I'd like to put her in little nighties, too.<eos> Not just vests all the time.<eos> Could someone bring in some baby clothes from home for you?
I had a little brother born with water on the brain.<eos> Oh, I had no idea.<eos> We aren't encouraged to talk about personal things.<eos> My mother wouldn't put him in a home, and when we took him out she'd say, "If people stare, stare back."<eos> And I never could because after they'd stared, they'd turn away and shake their heads.<eos> And when they did that, I could see him through their eyes.<eos> But we knew we loved him.<eos> He died a long time ago.<eos> And that was when we realised how much he'd really mattered.<eos> God bless you, Sister.
Doesn't baby deserve the best?<eos> Baby has the best.<eos> And it's free -- the breast.<eos> This is nonsense.<eos> Nonsense?<eos> Offering mothers choice?<eos> Healthy mothers don't need choice.<eos> Well, maybe she wants to go back to work.<eos> Maybe she wants her shape back.<eos> This is just shillings and pence to you, isn't it?
Yes!<eos> Pence!<eos> Paterson.<eos> Sir.<eos> Milling.<eos> Tender.<eos> Watts.<eos> And the Turpin brothers.<eos> That's it.<eos> We want you to have baby at home but if your blood pressure remains high we'll have to bring you in.
El, ella es.<eos> Nosotros, nosotras somos.<eos> Vosotros, vosotras sois.<eos> Might I say what lovely accents you young people have.<eos> Past tense.<eos> Oh, I've missed that sound.<eos> Glad you could make it, Tommy.<eos> Hola, Tommy!<eos> May I?<eos> I don't believe I've seen you here before?
So, "Weather mixed, work splendid, social injustice is still rife.<eos> "No accidents, injuries or boyfriends."<eos> Well, good night, Mr Smith.<eos> May I ask, senora or senorita?<eos> It's Miss.<eos> Buenas noches, Senorita Crane.<eos> Oh. Buenas noches.<eos> Puedo acompanarte a casa?<eos> Now you've lost me, I'm afraid.<eos> May I walk you home?

Have you ever known Nurse Crane speak so little yet say so much?<eos> ♪ Estas perdiendo el tiempo<eos> ♪ Pensando, pensando. ♪<eos> Mr Gibson, I don't mean to interrupt you.<eos> Keeping well, sir?<eos> Fit as a butcher's dog, Mrs Beckett.<eos> What dock's Johnny on?<eos> He forgot his dinner.<eos> I can't be no help to you.<eos> I don't follow you, sir.
No, no, I'm afraid not.<eos> Your Johnny's been telling lies.<eos> Go home, Mrs Beckett.<eos> But he must be back, he bought the pram.<eos> Mrs Beckett.<eos> Oh, good God.<eos> Someone fetch one of the Sisters!<eos> I don't understand how he's losing weight, I'm doing all I can.<eos> It's perfectly normal for a little while after birth -- he'll soon start putting it back on.<eos> Connie, is it still difficult for you, feeding?
We all need more than just our work.<eos> I sometimes think there must've been a terrible hole in my life before Keep Fit.<eos> Charming -- those were probably the evenings you spent with me.<eos> They weren't.<eos> Can I interest anyone in a barley sugar?<eos> Oh, yes, please!<eos> You know I rather envy you.<eos> You live life as you please.<eos> You have a motor car, your work and now a genuine passion.<eos> And no-one ever bothers you with endless questions about when you'll marry and why you don't have a gentleman friend.
"Put 'em up.<eos> Put 'em up."<eos> You're very kind, but there's no need.<eos> I did wonder -- might it be possible for you to... .."polish" me a little?<eos> Just a touch of powder, something around the eyes, perhaps. Nothing dramatic.<eos> Phyllis, you look quite magnificent.<eos> I'm sure I don't know why.<eos> Mind you, this is a new cardigan.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Actually, there's something I wanted to ask you.
Please, speak to her on my behalf.<eos> I will come back, if that's what He wants, but speak to her.<eos> Oh, Sister...<eos> Please.<eos> Nurse Crane -- a distressed gentleman wishes to speak with you.<eos> I beg your pardon.<eos> A Mr...<eos> Smith.<eos> Oh, erm, tell him I'm not at home.<eos> He awaits you in the front hall.
Thank you.<eos> Johnny?<eos> Here he is, my love.<eos> This is your daddy. Remember him.<eos> Please remember him.<eos> Our son.<eos> "John".<eos> John.<eos> Another Beckett at the docks.<eos> I love you both.
This is a respectable establishment.<eos> Miss Whitmore.<eos> - I've just paid next month's rent.<eos> - Which will serve in lieu of notice.<eos> Mrs Tucker, I don't have enough money...<eos> I'm sure your gentleman friend will help you out.<eos> You should be ashamed of yourself, you little madam.<eos> So should you, Mrs Tucker.<eos> At least I'm not a thief!<eos> I think you should ask Sister Julienne to take you off other midwifery duties until we know what this is.
- I know.<eos> If I'd had a rotten day like yours, I expect I'd be tetchy too.<eos> Have some of Violet's jam before Sister Monica Joan gets her hands on it.<eos> Then go and say sorry to our new housemate.<eos> Miss Whitmore!<eos> I'm sorry, Sister. I...<eos> I didn't know where else to go.<eos> Sister Julienne is telephoning the Women's Hostel.<eos> That's very kind.<eos> They have a place for you.
Nurse Gilbert, home visits.<eos> Nurse Franklin, you're on District, as expected.<eos> KNOCKING ON DOOR Comeon,hurryup!<eos> Yes, yes, sorry.<eos> Sister?<eos> Now that Miss Whitmore is at the women's hostel, we're no longer her nearest practice.<eos> Should I send her records on?<eos> Has she requested that we do?<eos> I just thought that with Sister Evangelina away and Nurse Mount unable to take midwifery cases, it might, well, ease the load a little.<eos> Is something troubling you, Sister?
- Benny, stay where you are!<eos> I don't want to hear another crack like that come out of your mouth, my girl.<eos> Benny is family and that's not how we treat family.<eos> Not in my house.<eos> So you apologise to him or get out now.<eos> Sorry, Benny.<eos> This family always faces things together.<eos> If we don't, everything falls apart.<eos> Excuse me, sorry to interrupt.<eos> Dr Turner, could I borrow you for a moment, please?
Yes, of course, Sister.<eos> Two pink spots on his abdomen.<eos> Let's see what the post mortem says.<eos> Miss Whitmore?<eos> I believe a gentleman delivered this to Mrs Tucker's home this morning.<eos> - Mrs Tucker and I had a disagreement...<eos> - Miss Whitmore, we expect all our staff to be of exemplary moral character.<eos> A serious allegation has been made.<eos> I would like you to tell me whether or not it's true.<eos> I'd rather not have to ask you to open your letter.

Space for a fridge.<eos> You don't even need to take the rubbish out - you just drop it down a chute.<eos> And think how easy it would be to clean.<eos> No need to scrub those poor hands till they bleed.<eos> I'm always going to have it, aren't I?<eos> Meg...<eos> I know what typhoid can cost a family.<eos> I really do.<eos> Your family didn't lose Jeanette.<eos> Please don't let them lose you.
'It was all we could do to keep pace, keep time, 'keep abreast of so much change.'<eos> Sister!<eos> - Whatever are you doing?<eos> - I'm cleaning the portrait of Sister Hildegard with some bread.<eos> Her anniversary's coming up, and I once read in a magazine that this is the best way to freshen up an oil painting.<eos> She was the first of our Sisters to come to Poplar.<eos> It's so important that we remember her.<eos> I missed her commemoration service last year, so this is the first I've been to since I joined the Order.<eos> It feels very special.<eos> Bless you, Sister.
I'm Sister Julienne.<eos> Ah, Sister.<eos> Glad to have you.<eos> The wards are chock-a-block.<eos> Handing over to another midwife now, dear.<eos> Notes are on the trolley.<eos> Why go?<eos> Why go?<eos> It's time for my break, Mrs Shahjee.<eos> I'll be able to look after you much better if I look after myself.
Sorry to interrupt ministerial business, Mr Hereward.<eos> Nurse Gilbert, Ruby Cottingham's in labour.<eos> It sounds as though things are moving rapidly.<eos> Will there be time for lunch?<eos> I strongly suspect not.<eos> I've packed us a hardboiled egg apiece and some coconut tart.<eos> Hay fever?<eos> Come on.<eos> Get in the car.<eos> I think we need to refer you to the hospital for tests.
I've been coughing on and off for years.<eos> Everybody does, round here.<eos> They said we'd all be cured, after the Clean Air Act.<eos> The Clean Air act won't have had much of an impact on conditions inside Hayward's, Mrs Bulmer.<eos> We need to rule out emphysema.<eos> It was emphysema what did for my husband.<eos> I'm a widow.<eos> I need to work.<eos> You have a strapping grown-up son, Mrs Bulmer.<eos> He could take care of you now.
- Brow presentation.<eos> - I'll telephone Doctor.<eos> He'll be on his house calls.<eos> It's like being crushed by an elephant.<eos> - I bet you've heard that one before. - Elephants.<eos> Rhinos.<eos> Hippopotami.<eos> And to extend the comparison, this baby's being a monkey.<eos> Not quite tucking its chin down as it should, I suspect.<eos> You might both do better if we send you off to hospital.
- Mrs Cottingham!<eos> - It's all gone wrong, Sister!<eos> Cervix not fully dilated.<eos> I can't get my fingers between the cervix and the head.<eos> It's so swollen.<eos> It's all right, Ruby...<eos> I'd be screaming my head off if you weren't here.<eos> No, you wouldn't.<eos> You've been a warrior.<eos> It's your own courage that's got you this far.
♪ World without end, Amen. ♪<eos> It was Sister Hildegard who began our work here in Poplar.<eos> And I and my Sisters carry on that work as best we can, day by day, night by night, woman by woman, child by child.<eos> Her faith was never shaken, and faith remains the foundation of our life.<eos> But there are times when we are challenged -- not in the vowed life, but as midwives and nurses.<eos> There are babies born broken.<eos> There are lives we cannot heal.<eos> And it is then that we should turn to the woman that so inspired our Sister that she took her name -- Saint Hildegard of Bingen.<eos> For Saint Hildegard once said,<eos> God hugs you.

I'm alone.<eos> Ohhh!<eos> Now breathe through it...<eos> I'm going to stay on the telephone till it's passed.<eos> Then I'm going to come straight to you.<eos> We're all right, Mrs Dawley.<eos> Now, is the front door unlocked?<eos> My spare's under the mat.<eos> Please come.<eos> I'll be with you in five minutes.
I need you to fetch me a midwife.<eos> We are quite alone.<eos> And you are simply to answer the telephone.<eos> I need you to go to the maternity home and fetch Nurse Mount.<eos> I am not to be trusted with clinical matters.<eos> We have an emergency.<eos> Please fetch a midwife.<eos> I shall go at once.<eos> Midwife's on her way.<eos> I'm going to stay on the telephone with you until she gets to you.
Nurse Busby.<eos> This little thing that we've created is so entirely perfect.<eos> I know what my mother meant by not fully knowing love or fear until she had me.<eos> - Fred! - Oh!<eos> - I've spilt my water!<eos> - Coming, my love.<eos> Although strictly a volunteer helper, I'd hope to see my good work reflected in this week's pocket money.<eos> I'm sure you would!<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> We know for some of you it took a great deal of effort.
This little lady grows hungry.<eos> I've tried.<eos> She doesn't want me.<eos> Perseverance, with a little help from Mssrs Grin Bearit.<eos> I want her on the bottle.<eos> That way I'll know when she's had enough.<eos> Try again, dear.<eos> Baby will grow so much stronger from what you can give her.<eos> My mother swore she could tell which babies had fed at the breast and which at the bottle.<eos> Might I trouble you for a cup of tea, Mr Dawley?
You make a very handsome butler.<eos> I make a very handsome haberdasher-er.<eos> No, not the shop, Fred.<eos> You wouldn't have a clue about haberdashery.<eos> We are a nation of shopkeepers, Mrs Buckle.<eos> - It's in our blood.<eos> - But you...<eos> The matter is closed.<eos> Hello, ladies.<eos> Yes, your eyes do not deceive you.
♪ And I'll stand out in buttons and bows... ♪<eos> If you choose this fabric, you can have a dress exactly like your mother's.<eos> Two peas in a pod.<eos> Mrs Dawley, my goodness you should be resting at home.<eos> I wanted to come for the cover for the pram.<eos> My husband put by one in pink and one in blue, for whichever we had.<eos> Of course, as long as you promise to go straight home.<eos> Put your feet up, long as you can.<eos> You won't get another holiday from mothering, dear.<eos> We heard about you, Mrs Dawley.
"Please forgive me".<eos> Oh, don't you fret, we'll find your mummy.<eos> Yes.<eos> But there must be something you can do?<eos> I, I'm only a couple of hours late.<eos> 'Her order's always on time.'<eos> Yeah, I, I know Mrs Buckle is never late with her order but I'm not Mrs Buckle.<eos> - 'Sorry.<eos> There's nothing I can do.'<eos> - Look, I'm begging you for a favour!
I'm dying.<eos> You could live longer and better.<eos> - That is a choice.<eos> - Used to call me her movie star.<eos> We had the real ones in the club. She never looked twice at them.<eos> That's how I want her to remember me.<eos> How I want my kids to.<eos> And what about what they want?<eos> Oh, hello, Nurse Crane?<eos> I wasn't expecting to see you?
But I wish, oh, I wish so much she were here now so I could put my arms round her, tell her she's good and strong, and the bravest woman I ever knew.<eos> Shame will keep us in all kinds of prisons if we let it.<eos> And it will keep us from those we love, and who love us.<eos> Your little girl wants you.<eos> Don't abandon her because you were abandoned.<eos> Mr Phillips?<eos> How can I help?<eos> Get me into the London, doc, fast as you like.<eos> I will beg, borrow and steal every minute I can get.<eos> We'll take you in as soon as we can.
Sometimes for people to make the right choice, you must first show them the worst choice.<eos> You never actually smoked, did you?<eos> Hey, Sis. They're going to be around for a long time to come.<eos> Isn't that the best news?<eos> The rate I'm eating biscuits, I shall be needing a new dress.<eos> I've a good mind to take it out of your pocket money, Tim.<eos> You can both have every shilling I have.<eos> You're my world.<eos> I don't know what kind of a man I'm going to be after the radium.<eos> I don't want to be a greater burden on you.
'Past perfection is a wondrous thing.'<eos> The Bible had a plague of locusts, we have a plague of pensioners!<eos> Scarcely a crumb left in their wake, and I'm sorry to say that I've just had my bottom pinched.<eos> - I think that's Mr Pilbeam.<eos> The man on the right trestle table.<eos> - You too?<eos> Twice. I asked Tom to give him a hard, cold stare, but it didn't discourage him at all.<eos> Afternoon, dear!<eos> - Mrs Hills?<eos> How lovely to see you!
There's no harm in taking the weight off your feet for five minutes.<eos> Especially given your rather interesting condition.<eos> This?<eos> Yes, number five.<eos> It gets to be like shelling peas.<eos> I seem to remember WE helped shell peas number two, three and four.<eos> I hope we haven't done anything to offend.<eos> I'm going to the clinic at St Cuthbert's.<eos> They want me to have it in hospital, on account of my age.<eos> Well, they're obviously taking very good care of you, because you look extremely well.
I'm sorry, Lizzie.<eos> It won't sting for long.<eos> It's well sugared.<eos> - Do you mind if I smoke?<eos> - Not at all.<eos> Here.<eos> It's all right, Lizzie.<eos> You're safe here.<eos> - I should go.<eos> - I can walk you to the police station, after Nurse Gilbert's tidied you up.
It's not right, though, is it?<eos> It's the law.<eos> Ah, Sister.<eos> I wasn't sure if you'd been called out yet.<eos> It's no doubt the calm before the storm, but the phone hasn't rung once this morning.<eos> I thought I'd get ahead with the chapel flowers. And some for your office.<eos> You have a knack for floristry, Sister.<eos> And a very sweet voice.<eos> A sweet voice?<eos> And in chapel, I can hardly hear you.
My strength comes from another source.<eos> And I hope you do not need to ask from whence.<eos> No, of course not. But...<eos> How recently did you study for Novices' Vows? Were you not apprised of the practice of mortification of the flesh?<eos> Yes. (Oh...) Are you trying to fast?<eos> I have few joys and therefore little to surrender.<eos> Sister, you found the Lenten fast very hard.<eos> I am in fair health now, and able to sustain the sacrifice.<eos> But, Sister, IF you want to fast, you must tell the rest of the community what you're doing.<eos> That way we can uphold you.
We've been experimenting with a new antibiotic powder...<eos> Which I will be delighted to discuss with Dr Godfrey.<eos> It's cutting-edge stuff like this that brings me out of retirement time and time again!<eos> I imagine you feel the same.<eos> I shall consider retirement as and when I reach the appropriate age, Dr Godfrey, which will not be for some years.<eos> Shelagh, I can get the tents or the children in the car.<eos> But not both!<eos> May I refer you to my earlier offer to loan you my roof rack, which you declined?<eos> - You may.<eos> I left it out for you in the hall at Nonnatus House.
I thought it might help keep the things on the roof rack dry.<eos> - It's an incontinence sheet from the charity box.<eos> - Perfect!<eos> I hope it doesn't smell of urine.<eos> Ooh, by the way, Doc, I like the shorts.<eos> I had a pair like that in El Alamein.<eos> I had a pair in Monte Cassino.<eos> No wonder we won the war!<eos> The place is upside down, Sister.<eos> I wasn't expecting you.
Nurse Gilbert told me what happened.<eos> I'd like to help.<eos> In which case, the best thing you can do is find out where my husband went.<eos> Because if you did that, I wouldn't be having to sell myself to help feed the kids I had because I gave myself - for nothing - to a man I thought might stick around!<eos> - I'm sorry, Mrs...<eos> - Call me Lizzie.<eos> That's what I say to all the blokes.<eos> And I'm not saying anything else to you!<eos> Morning.<eos> Sorry to keep you, Fred.
They play the records to a panel of experts, and then they give their verdict.<eos> And they are often incorrect in their opinion.<eos> That is why we at Nonnatus House generally confine ourselves to Songs Of Praise and Panorama.<eos> It's a bally catchy little tune.<eos> Who's singing it?<eos> Pinky And Perky.<eos> You can't see them, but they're pigs.<eos> Although they are not real.<eos> Doctor Godfrey!<eos> I have just been flagged down in the street by a patient who's been waiting for a house-call from you, since three o'clock this afternoon, in acute pain with psoriatic arthritis.
Employ Brandt Andrews, and, er, don't forget, good pull on the cord.<eos> - Thank you, Doctor.<eos> - Best of British!<eos> - Doctor Godfrey!<eos> - Apologies for appearing deshabille!<eos> I have heard such enticing things about the midnight larder at Nonnatus House.<eos> The larder's in the kitchen.<eos> I came down because I heard the telephone.<eos> One of your colleagues struggling to deliver a placenta.<eos> She asked for you, but I obliged with procedural advice.
I'm just going to pull on it, all right?<eos> SHE SCREAMS<eos> SCREAMING<eos> What's happened?<eos> - What's your name, sweetie?<eos> - It's Diane.<eos> We're here to help, Diane.<eos> - What have I done?<eos> - Baby's well.<eos> Let me examine you and see what's causing all this pain.
I'll tell her.<eos> She's already asked to see me in her office.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sister.<eos> Your courage and your forbearance over the last few weeks has been admirable in every conceivable way.<eos> - You have my absolute respect.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> But I haven't done anything out of the ordinary.<eos> I just carried on.<eos> And it is for that very reason that I have wanted to send you to the Mother House ever since you were attacked.

Oh, get down!<eos> You could hurt yourself!<eos> I can't stop myself, nurse.<eos> Yesterday, it was cleaning.<eos> And when there was nothing left to clean, I started painting.<eos> Please let me finish -<eos> - I've only got one more stroke with the brush.<eos> In which case, I shall do it.<eos> But it's not your job.<eos> My job is looking after you, and that involves stopping you falling, A, off this chair and, B, out of the window.
♪ Tiger<eos> ♪ Tiger<eos> ♪ Tiger... ♪<eos> It is good of you to come.<eos> But I'm feeling much better now.<eos> - Not that much better.<eos> - Don't contradict your mother, Lou.<eos> They were good to her at the hospital, but they said she was all right to leave.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We've interrupted you during your meal.
Baby's heartbeat's wonderfully strong.<eos> Felt like a failure, being taken to the hospital.<eos> Having them do blood tests.<eos> I should be able to get the results tomorrow.<eos> And I can bring them here for you, or you could come by our clinic?<eos> There are things we can give you for your other children -- free orange juice, and so forth, or rosehip syrup if you prefer.<eos> Rosehip?<eos> You can do a lot with rosehips.<eos> I make tea with them sometimes.<eos> You've been awfully good to me, but I really shouldn't keep you.
Top of the milk for you, and make sure you help yourself to an extra potato.<eos> That being said, I'm not sure how much longer you've got left.<eos> There's still nothing doing, Nurse.<eos> I thought, if I came down here, it might stop me painting the bathroom.<eos> Or me husband.<eos> - Ah, is he getting restless, too?<eos> - Not so's you'd notice.<eos> It's like he don't even know there's a baby on the way.<eos> Thank you, Sister.<eos> I'm sorry to have kept you.
And I'll fetch Nurse Mount.<eos> It was my husband made me come.<eos> I had a hard time having Jonah, it took me ages to pick up afterwards.<eos> These things do all get rather harder with age.<eos> Where was Jonah born?<eos> In a barge, like the others.<eos> I always liked the quiet, the being on me own...<eos> On your own?<eos> But maybe not this time.<eos> Well, we can look after you when you deliver.
Do you want to go to school, or do you want to stop with Dad?<eos> School.<eos> All right.<eos> Very wise.<eos> So, if I could just get you to confirm that I've entered your name, address and birthdate correctly on the booking form, we're all shipshape and Bristol fashion.<eos> I haven't brought me glasses.<eos> Not to worry. I'll fine-tune the paperwork.<eos> Sister Monica Joan, I really don't think Dr Turner wants to be competing with the Black and White Minstrels.<eos> The room required cleansing with glad acts, for it had been unsettled by the advent of strange medicine.<eos> What's happened to trouble you, Sister?
And I owe you -- all of you -- even more.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Like any method of contraception, you have to use it religiously, or it doesn't work.<eos> And there are some groups of women who'll find taking daily medication difficult.<eos> Which could be a catastrophe, if they are single.<eos> I'm extremely concerned that we do nothing to promote... recreational intercourse and I'm sure Mr Hereward feels the same.<eos> Well, what are the government guidelines?<eos> Mr Hereward, shouldn't you be more concerned with church teachings than government guidelines?<eos> Well, I do think we have to be mindful of the Bible.<eos> When Paul wrote to the Corinthians, he said, "There is too much immorality among you.
Oh, Gina... you've had a long night, but this is normal -- especially with a first baby -- and you are doing so well.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> It hurts.<eos> It hurts so much and that gas is useless!<eos> Oh, it's not useless.<eos> It's run out.<eos> Mr Matlin?<eos> - Mr Matlin!<eos> - I'm sorry, I fell asleep.<eos> And I'm sorry I had to wake you, but I need you to make a phone call for me.
Sooner them than me!<eos> Midwife calling!<eos> This way, Nurse, and mind your head!<eos> We've got the water on already.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We heard her kicking off yelling and... well, we all know what that sort of racket means, don't we?<eos> She's calmed down a bit since she's had some company.<eos> - Hello, nurse.<eos> - Any objection to me popping by?<eos> - I can just leave you with your friends.
Nelson Tower... - 'Yes.'<eos> Anchorage Estate...<eos> Flat number...<eos> Oh. Hello?<eos> Hell's teeth!<eos> Good grief!<eos> Come on!<eos> And that's me excused physical jerks for the rest of the week.<eos> It's a good job you live on the 8th floor, young lady, not the 18th.<eos> Let's have a look at you, love.
One foot in front of the other.<eos> There you go.<eos> Almost there, sweetheart.<eos> Still in one piece, kids?<eos> She's being sick!<eos> That's it.<eos> That's wonderful, Daisy.<eos> Come on, you lovebirds.<eos> Save your courting...<eos> Till we've got you safely in that ambulance.
'For some, the high winds altered very little.<eos> 'The Blackers, with their healthy newborn, 'left London and headed North along straight waterways 'that hadn't changed in decades.'<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Aw, bye!<eos> Have a safe trip. - 'Sister Winifred arranged 'for the children's lessons to be sent to them and marked by post.<eos> 'It was something.<eos> 'Meanwhile, Leslie Matlin grew in strength, 'courage and love for his wife and child.<eos> 'For not every happiness is chosen.<eos> Some, like the harvest, 'simply have to be accepted.'<eos> Sister, I was looking for you.
But, just now, the thing that worries me is you.<eos> Why?<eos> I've never felt better!<eos> I wish I could believe that. But it's not true, is it?<eos> - I take it you mean this?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I had a stroke.<eos> Two months after I left for the retreat.<eos> Why didn't you let us know?<eos> - We could've prayed for you, at the very least.
Just silky, whisper-light, nylon clinging like a second skin from waist to toe.<eos> Sounds like a breeding ground for yeast!<eos> Oh, I wish we had one of those plastic tomatoes!<eos> I can't get anything out of this bottle at all!<eos> Is there nowhere a woman can get 40 uninterrupted winks around this place?<eos> Five minutes to gather my thoughts before Compline!<eos> That's all I ask - and what do I get?<eos> Conversations about nylons and sauce bottles being banged like it's going out of fashion!<eos> Sorry, Sister Evangelina.<eos> I take it we can't tempt you to a savoury snack?
Mum, Noelle's ship's in tomorrow!<eos> It was in the paper.<eos> I called in the dock office and they said it was definite!<eos> You'd better add a maternity girdle to that list.<eos> I have my doubts about Australian foundation garments.<eos> Congratulations!<eos> That's absolutely perfect, Tripti.<eos> There's no need to thank me, Muna.<eos> It's all part of the job.<eos> Now, let's get you on the bed and see if we can have a listen to Baby.
Hello, Mum!<eos> What do you think you're doing, pitching up early?<eos> They let her off the boat first because she's in the family way.<eos> There's certainly no missing it, is there?<eos> And here she is.<eos> This is Noelle.<eos> I was going to put balloons up and a notice saying, "Welcome!"<eos> But I didn't want you to think I was common.<eos> The house looks lovely.<eos> Can I call you Tessie, Mrs Anselm?
It's from Distillers Biochemicals.<eos> But they just say that there is a possible association with harmful effects on the foetus.<eos> And it also says there are only two reports from abroad and none from Great Britain.<eos> I don't understand it.<eos> But this letter came, Patrick! Distaval's being withdrawn!<eos> Shelagh, I have prescribed Distaval to dozens of patients perhaps scores!<eos> Deformed babies have been born in our district.<eos> We need to speak to someone and then we need to act.<eos> I don't think anything's going to happen just yet, Noelle.<eos> I feel like a bit of a chump, calling you out when there was no need.
Really?<eos> Clearly as I hear God's, when something deep and precious happens, as clearly as I ever heard hers when she was telling me off, which happened quite often over the years.<eos> It happened to me, too.<eos> But this time, she was saying, "Poor girl, "all the way from Australia,<eos> "Tessie Anselm as a mother-in-law and no proper wedding dress.<eos> "Give her mine, for pity's sake!"<eos> Well, now's not the time to start arguing with her, is it?<eos> Is it?<eos> Nonnatus House?<eos> Sister, I'm afraid I have to ask you to come to the surgery as soon you can.
- May I speak to your wife?<eos> It's regarding a problem with her prescription medication.<eos> I must take them, I'm afraid, Mrs Jones, even if there are just two remaining.<eos> Mrs Michaels?<eos> Prescription patients have been passing Distaval around as if they were nuts at a party.<eos> I've knocked at Rhoda Mullucks' house twice.<eos> There's no-one in.<eos> Her neighbours don't know where they've gone.<eos> Mrs Cottingham...<eos> Last time I saw you, I was in the hospital.
Vicente Martínez. Police inspector of Gran Canaria.<eos> - Come with me, please.<eos> - Sure.<eos> We've found the same substance in all the bodies. A strong opiate.<eos> So they were drugged when they jumped.<eos> Everything seems to indicate that.<eos> It's not her.<eos> No, it's not her.<eos> Here, on this one. And here.<eos> Boss, this is for you.
They'll pick it up in a couple of hours.<eos> Leave the keys in. No one will steal it.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - We're trying to get to the farm.<eos> - Why do you want to go there?<eos> Those people were not right in the head.<eos> - His sister was with them.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - OK, then. I'll take you there.
Your moment has gone.<eos> We know that.<eos> That child will be raised by you and me.<eos> Come here.<eos> What?<eos> Do you feel it?<eos> It's too soon.<eos> We're gonna be parents.<eos> That baby is not yours.<eos> I don't want to see you together again.
Not the way I should.<eos> Since I can't touch the king, I'm gonna take his queen, his knights... his rooks...<eos> I'm knocking all his pieces off the board.<eos> Where you goin' now?<eos> Check these fools.<eos> Three friends.<eos> Grade school tight. Playground tight. All-City in basketball in a town where that really matters.<eos> So what happens?<eos> Y'all don't go pro.<eos> One of you...
And somebody is gonna start asking questions.<eos> -Step off, Cornell!<eos> -Shut up, Black Mariah.<eos> That's my shit to break!<eos> You better shut up, or I will cut your color-struck ass.<eos> Call me that again.<eos> Uh, Mr. Stokes?<eos> Spit it out.<eos> There's-<eos> - There's a detective here to see you.
The sequel better than the original?<eos> [Luke] Close.<eos> Look, I was defending' myself killing that dude.<eos> - But you went to his house.<eos> - It was...<eos> Whatcha... whatcha call it?<eos> - Preventative.<eos> - Just more excuses.<eos> That's all I've heard for the last 20 minutes.<eos> I mean, do any of you ever say to yourself,
Your grandmother, the notorious Mabel Stokes, and her brother-in-law, Pistol Pete Stokes, shown here, were major players in it.<eos> The boy in that photo would grow up to be Cornell Stokes, aka Cottonmouth, a man whose name rings out in both legitimate and criminal circles.<eos> Oh, that's a... that's a personal photograph.<eos> You... you really, uh, have no right to show that one.<eos> Well, how about this one?<eos> A somehow brutal assault that took place at the Crispus Attucks Houses didn't make the news.<eos> Even stranger was the millions of dollars in cash found on the premises in your office.<eos> There's some people on the scene even describe a man who, under a barrage of gunfire, managed to beat down a number of criminals, some of whom may have worked for your family.<eos> So you can see how it might be difficult to decipher which Harlem you stand for.<eos> Despite these unwarranted attacks on my character, I have always tried to make clear what I want... which I can't say for you, Thembi.
Yeah.<eos> Who you telling?<eos> But he's innocent.<eos> - I give you my word.<eos> - That may be.<eos> But all this tension is hurting the council - and it's harming the party.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> When will you make the announcement?<eos> Charlene will send a press release at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.<eos> I'm going to have to ask you to resign, effective immediately.
After I showered, I came out to see Cornell.<eos> I still needed my paycheck.<eos> I heard loud voices and a struggle.<eos> That's when I walked out and I saw Mr. Stokes down below on the floor.<eos> [sighs]<eos> Luke Cage saw me and ran away.<eos> He was wearing bright yellow gloves, like the kind he used to use when he washed dishes.<eos> And you're positive it was Luke Cage?<eos> You would know.<eos> I saw you two at the bar together the other night.
I should be out there doing my job.<eos> [Krasner] Your job is out there waiting for you, Detective.
Whatever.<eos> [inhales sharply] Let's do this.<eos> Detective Mercedes Kelly Knight, badge 3-0-9-3-5.<eos> You know, you're not being recorded.<eos> Of course I am.<eos> You know this is bullshit, right?<eos> Things got rough with a hostile witness.<eos> You think that's the first time this has ever happened?<eos> You lost control.<eos> [inhales] And it's all about control with you, isn't it?
You're not gonna beg?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Not even a little bit?<eos> [crying]<eos> If you gonna kill me, then just do it.<eos> What shook you?<eos> Was it losing your gun to one suspect while trying to arrest another without backup?<eos> Was it the extra eyes because of Scarfe?<eos> Was it this Luke Cage guy?<eos> What pushed you towards career suicide?

Male cops can screw cop groupies in the back of their unmarked or their RMP, and you guys cheer.<eos> They get drunk and fight each other in the parking lot, and it's called blowing off steam.<eos> There's always a double standard.<eos> [inhales] And you never screwed anyone that you shouldn't have while you were on the job?<eos> No.<eos> But you choked out a witness.<eos> Own your shit.<eos> You went renegade when you went after Luke Cage alone.<eos> And it got... [scoffs] way deeper than it should have.<eos> And this guy took the control away from you when he took your gun.

To pick out those subjects that were most psychologically ready - to survive the process, Carl. - Stop calling me that!<eos> I'm Luke.<eos> Carl died at Seagate.<eos> What, you're still pining like a lovesick puppy for Reva?<eos> Please.<eos> She lied to everybody.<eos> That was her job.<eos> She lied to you about her involvement.<eos> I promise I'll explain it all.<eos> She lied again when she erased both of you from existence.
-Mr. Tower.<eos> What's going on?<eos> -You tell me.<eos> We've been closely following Cage's activities.<eos> The mayor would like me to help coordinate.<eos> -The situation is coordinated.<eos> -Really?<eos> -We're on the same side...<eos> -Hmm.<eos> ...and I'd like to guide you as how best to achieve an outcome that's beneficial to all parties.
Look, any weapon that the police or military has eventually ends up on the street.<eos> You know it's dangerous to even show that kind of power.<eos> Hey, but I don't see we got much of a choice.<eos> -I don't trust Mariah Dillard.<eos> -Yeah, I don't either.<eos> But she has juice with people way above our paygrade.<eos> I just don't want this to turn into the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.<eos> Frank Castle shot the city to hell, and he only had regular bullets.<eos> Now imagine what he or somebody like him can do with these things.<eos> Yeah, I hear you.
And Luke is still wanted for Albini's murder, Cottonmouth's murder,<eos> -and attacking those cops.<eos> -You are not listening to me.<eos> Luke Cage is innocent of everything.<eos> And after we have him in custody, we'll verify it.<eos> Look... I trust you.<eos> I do.<eos> But we have to verify.<eos> The only thing that matters is the truth.<eos> We got you, Detective.
[Green] All right, here's the plan.<eos> Triple-cuff him.<eos> Alpha team, you take point positions in the convoy.<eos> Bravo team will bring up the rear.<eos> Remember, we're clear to engage, so if he so much as looks at you funny, light him up.
You didn't wanna talk to me before.<eos> What makes you trust me now?<eos> Because Luke Cage does.<eos> He saved my life.<eos> And you saw right through me.<eos> -You want the truth, right? -Where are you?<eos> -Look, if you can't help--<eos> -Candace.<eos> Tell me a place, and I will be there.<eos> [Ridley] You should be at Rikers right now, but I held you... because I think you have something to say.
The homie, Method Man, HB, and the bulletproof thug, Luke Cage.<eos> Law enforcement is in a frenzy looking for Luke Cage.<eos> There have been numerous false sightings, with some people wearing hoodies with holes as a sign of solidarity with an outlaw some people still perceive to be a hero.<eos> Sway in the Morning.<eos> What's on your mind, citizen?<eos> [man] Yo, I remember when Larry Davis was on the run back in the day.<eos> Cops came at him 'cause they were just as corrupt, dangerous and jacked up as he was.<eos> I don't think we're getting the full story on Luke Cage yet, for real.<eos> [Sway] I wouldn't put it past the government, man.<eos> Um, you know, we're gonna be searching for the answers for you, and once we get the facts, we're gonna put it right here on Sway's Universe, all right?
You ready?<eos> I stay ready, baby.<eos> I should've kept my coat on.<eos> Hell just froze over.<eos> [door closes]<eos> -Where's Luke Cage?<eos> -I'm right here.<eos> -We have a problem.<eos> -So do I.<eos> I can't decide which one of you I'm gonna knock out first.
[man] Carl Lucas, I'm Marshal Franco.<eos> This is Marshal Johnson.<eos> You're under arrest for your unlawful escape from Seagate Prison.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You won't need those.<eos> -Says who?<eos> -[Luke] Says me.<eos> I'm done running.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Cage.<eos> I'm gonna recommend the New York City DA's office drop all charges against you.
-[Luke] Says me.<eos> I'm done running.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Cage.<eos> I'm gonna recommend the New York City DA's office drop all charges against you.<eos> I have done all I can.<eos> Thank you for all you've done for us.<eos> Luke is innocent.<eos> They're not arresting Luke Cage.<eos> They're arresting Carl Lucas.<eos> Who called you?
- I'm trying to cut down. - Yeah, me, too.<eos> - Take that, sucker.<eos> - Nice move.<eos> Mr. Bonneville.<eos> I love your work.<eos> - Champagne? - Thank you.<eos> Cheers.<eos> You're the Frank Bonneville?<eos> - Apparently.<eos> - I listen to you every day.
You gotta be begging. Begging for your life.<eos> This guy, he wants to kill you.<eos> He wants to stick you like a pig, so you need to beg.<eos> - A nice word to your family, to your wife. - Yeah.<eos> The lens? That's the whole world, right there.<eos> - You gotta connect. - Yeah.<eos> - Do you understand? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.<eos> President.<eos> Beg the president, mention the family, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.<eos> We are hostages of the Ecuadorian Liberation Front, and I beg you, Mr. President, please help us.
- She thinks we're trying to get her money. - She doesn't trust him.<eos> - You gotta talk to her. - You talk to her.<eos> - Talk to her, please.<eos> - I'm gonna hand you to the head bandit.<eos> - Hello, ma'am. - Eleanor.<eos> Eleanor, if you don't pay, I'm gonna kill your husband and Mr. Franks.<eos> Kill everybody.<eos> Greetings from New York.<eos> - What'd she say?<eos> - She said to kill you all.
So, you have no one that loves you that is willing to pay money to get you back.<eos> Completely useless to us. Worthless.<eos> We might as well get some entertainment out of you.<eos> You two are fighting to the death. Come on, get up.<eos> Can I use the toilet, please?<eos> - I need to... - Come on, get up.<eos> What do you mean fight to the death? That's ridiculous.<eos> You're gonna shoot me?<eos> The other ones are going to hear the shots, they're gonna come in here: pop, pop, pop.<eos> - Shoot you to bits.

Erica Kravid, took him.<eos> I know she took Tommy.<eos> My brother and I need to be in Odessa.<eos> Whatever you have to do, whatever it takes, I'm gonna be right there with you, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> So what's our time frame? How long before this thing hits?<eos> - Two days.<eos> - Oh, two days, plenty of time.<eos> Okay, Tommy's been taken to Midian, Colorado, which means that's our first stop, and then we get you two to Odessa.

So there you go.<eos> That's who they are.<eos> How was your first day?<eos> I found this.<eos> On the card is twins.<eos> When I touched it, I... got this feeling like someone was watching me.<eos> You know what this is, don't you?<eos> It's a message from your father, Malina.<eos> It means he's coming back for you and your brother.<eos> And this time, no one will be able to protect you.
Ignác!<eos> Hot soup. Come.<eos> Come in.<eos> I take it you are heading for Prague.<eos> How far is it?<eos> Thirty kilometers.<eos> I have a special delivery permit for my truck.<eos> I could take you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You rest here tonight. I will take you in the morning.
Dinner will be at 6:00.<eos> Please sit.<eos> Ata, dinner is ready.<eos> And finally the fiddler is silent.<eos> He is a violinist, Alois.<eos> A violinist.<eos> You two boys looking for work, then?<eos> Yes.<eos> We are always looking for men to clean the cinders out of the locomotives.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Moravec.
Arrived 9:15, left 5:15, and with an armed escort.<eos> Armed escort?<eos> There's only one person in Prague that travels with an armed escort.<eos> Are you going to assassinate Heydrich?<eos> What?<eos> Heydrich is the target?<eos> For your own safety, it's best that you don't ask too many questions.<eos> It's a bit too late for that now.<eos> Well, you agreed to help the resistance.<eos> Who the target is should not concern you.
The SS still have the hospital surrounded, so presumably, he's still alive.<eos> It seems like the Germans have more men and guns up there than on the Eastern Front.<eos> They have taken several thousand hostages.<eos> So, what do we do now?<eos> Nothing is leaving or entering Prague.<eos> They are searching door to door.<eos> We have no safe houses left.<eos> So, where do we go?<eos> I've asked Father Vladimir Petrek.<eos> He has agreed to hide all the parachutists that are still here in Prague until we can return you to London.
- It's my fault.<eos> - It's not your fault.<eos> - It's my fault. - It's not your fault, Josef.<eos> It's not your fault, okay.<eos> I am sorry, Jan.<eos> I'm sorry, Marie.<eos> Mrs. Moravec, I'm sorry.<eos> Hey, it's okay. It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Father Petrek will meet you in there.
A full pardon for any person and their family in exchange for any information about the assassins, even if they did not come forward before.<eos> But there is a deadline of five days.<eos> After that, they plan to execute 30,000 Czechs.<eos> - This must stop.<eos> - What do you propose?<eos> Me and Josef will go to a park, place placards around our necks saying that we killed Heydrich and commit suicide.<eos> - Stupid talk. This is stupid talk.<eos> As a soldier, it is your duty to stay alive and continue fighting.<eos> Do you understand that, Warrant Officer Kubiš?<eos> The responsibility does not rest with you.
I'll come around and cut them off.<eos> Smith, I know you're with Bourne.<eos> You have to find a way to let us know where you are.<eos> Why are you taking me in here?<eos> They got to be near the Plaza.<eos> Jesus, Bourne. God damn it.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Richard Webb. - Station Chief, Beirut.<eos> He was my father, he started Treadstone.<eos> - He hired you to put me under survellaince, why?
He was always going to come for me.<eos> Well, if it happens, we'll deal with it.<eos> U.S. Air Security Border Protection - search Christopher Michaels 1 result returned<eos> - modify clearance<eos> What was the purpose of your visit to London, Mr. Michaels?<eos> Business.<eos> Facial Recognition - PROCESSING Passport Status - PROCESSING<eos> Welcome home, sir.<eos> Thank you,<eos> Sir, we have a secure room for you, right upstairs.

Absolutely.<eos> How'd you do on your English test?<eos> Hmm, I think I failed.<eos> Good morning, Miss Samuels.<eos> Good morning, Miss Brooks.<eos> How are you this morning?<eos> Oh, well, we have a cook.<eos> He's black, he makes grits with secrets... and he's hanging out in our kitchen.<eos> So, what kind of a deal did Richard make with you?<eos> I was just asked to cook for you and your child... till you passed on, ma'am.
You need to wake her so she can eat.<eos> I want you to take this to her.<eos> I have homework.<eos> Oh, come on, Charlotte. She had a good day.<eos> She's still going to die, Mr. Church.<eos> Hey, you're awake.<eos> I thought I heard Charlie.<eos> Did she come right up from school?<eos> Yeah, she's doing her homework.<eos> She didn't want to disturb you.
All right, just tell me what your house looks like.<eos> Or tell me who your best friend is.<eos> - Come on, just tell me...<eos> - Hey, I said enough!<eos> Don't you know when to back off?<eos> Enough.<eos> You've never raised your voice to me.<eos> I'm sorry about that.<eos> I just...<eos> I just want to know more about you.
- Just get out! - Where am I supposed to go?<eos> It's the middle of the night.<eos> That's not my goddamn problem.<eos> I'm not a child anymore, Mr. Church!<eos> Or are you too drunk to see that?<eos> What is it with all of you?<eos> The secrets and lies and more secrets?<eos> Don't tell Charlie I'm dying.<eos> Don't tell Charlie a goddamn thing.<eos> I just wanted to know you, Mr. Church.
Mr. Church...<eos> Come on, Mr. Church.<eos> One dance.<eos> Charlie?<eos> It's crazy, right?<eos> It's wonderful.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Thank you so much for coming out.<eos> Larson fell in love with a gel he met at one of his AA meetings.<eos> You know, she wouldn't be here if it weren't for you.
Tell you a story.<eos> Okay.<eos> Once upon a time...<eos> They always start that way.<eos> Well, that's how you know it's a story, my dear.<eos> Once upon a time, there was a little... boy.<eos> What was his name?<eos> What would you like his name to be?<eos> Henry.<eos> Like you.
Yes.<eos> I was a friend.<eos> Name's Frankie Twiggs.<eos> Folks call me Jelly.<eos> Jelly?<eos> I'm sorry for, you know, barging in... but we hadn't seen Hands for quite some time... and we done missed him, and I just......<eos> "Hands?"<eos> Yeah, that's what we called him on account of...<eos> He played piano at my bar for over 30 years.<eos> So, he worked for you.
Americans need an anthem that inspires and excites, an anthem that has something for everyone, while still paying tribute to what it once was.<eos> I believe there's only one person capable of achieving this...<eos> J.J. Abrams.<eos> Oh, J.J. Abrams!<eos> He saved "Star Wars," and now we will ask him to save our country.<eos> Mr. Abrams?<eos> Mr. Abrams, we need to speak with you.<eos> Look there.<eos> Mr. Abrams, I speak on behalf of Americans everywhere.<eos> We've come to ask you to reboot the national anthem.
If vaginas don't have balls, what do they have?<eos> It's not gonna work, Cartman!<eos> I'm not gonna let you divide boys and girls in this school anymore!<eos> When this whole thing comes to a head, you're gonna be all on your own.<eos> Hello, sir.<eos> How are you today?<eos> I'm calling from the campaign for president, just seeing if, uh, I can get your support for Hillary Clinton today?<eos> Yes, I know she's a Turd Sandwich, but, you know, if... if you look past that, you know, she...<eos> She really has a lot to offer.<eos> Well, I hear you, but, you know, sometimes in life, you just got to suck a turd, you know?
And, Mike, this new anthem is said to have everything the old one had, but some new surprises, as well.<eos> You'd have to be an absolute asshole not to stand and support it.<eos> This is such a big night for America that both the presidential candidates are here.<eos> There you can see the Turd Sandwich waving to all four people excited by her, and there is the Giant Douche doing the same.<eos> When I sit down to not support this thing, I'm sure to lose this election.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen...<eos> Here it is!<eos> And the anthem begins.<eos> Let's hope this fixes America.<eos> For our national anthem, we now ask you all in solidarity to please rise, or sit, or take a knee in order to honor America.

Yes, and I know the tree speaks to you.<eos> Did Lorin tell you that?<eos> Well, not exactly.<eos> What aren't you telling me?<eos> I think it's better if the Druid explains everything.<eos> You're here with a Druid.<eos> I thought they were all dead.<eos> This one just took a very long nap.<eos> Are you his errand boy?<eos> Actually, Allanon brought me along to protect you.
Seriously?<eos> She's fine.<eos> Hey, it's me.<eos> - Hiya.<eos> - So, listen.<eos> I was thinking it could be good for us to meet John Carter before the weddin'.<eos> Who?<eos> Your boyfriend.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> So why don't the two of you's come over for a beer or somethin' on Saturday?
Hi, I'm Jess, nice to meet you.<eos> OK, can I get everybody looking in here?<eos> That's great.<eos> So, what I think I'm gonna do is just step the girls out for, like, two seconds and get some photos of the guys.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah, just move down a couple of steps.<eos> That's perfect.<eos> Smile.<eos> Awesome.<eos> So, uh, have all of you got girlfriends?
I said I'm fine.<eos> At least give us a small hug.<eos> Back off.<eos> Let go of me, arsehole!<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> 5 seconds to drop your toothpick and get out of here.<eos> One, two, three, four...<eos> Who do you think you are?<eos> My father?<eos> Just someone who worries about you.
I miss her so much.<eos> All right.<eos> Tonight you're staying over at your old man Lanester's.<eos> Thank you, it's kind of you.<eos> It's only normal.<eos> Not long ago you saved my backside.<eos> This is the least I can do.<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> If that guy last night had tried to stab you, would you have shot him?
Any progress?<eos> Slowly but surely.<eos> In my day police officers were never so pretty.<eos> Maybe that's because she isn't a police officer.<eos> She's my driver. Excuse me.<eos> But the compliment remains, miss.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you for your time.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Let me show you out.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you for your time.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Let me show you out.<eos> Partial to flattery, are we?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> - You were swooning.<eos> - No I wasn't. - Yes you were.<eos> - Not at all.<eos> I'm telling you.
- No.<eos> She told her before she went missing.<eos> She made her swear to keep it a secret between them.<eos> It confirms our suspicions all along.<eos> We must go over it all.<eos> We already have.<eos> We'll do it again.<eos> Team meeting tomorrow at 8am.<eos> All right.<eos> I should bawl you out.
When I went blind last month, events from my past resurfaced.<eos> Memories of me, my brother and my father.<eos> He killed himself with his service revolver in our room.<eos> Give me your gun.<eos> Maybe you just need time.<eos> No, this is permanent.<eos> What good is a cop who can't shoot?<eos> You should see someone.<eos> I am, it isn't helping.<eos> I wanted to tell you first before the chief.
Life as you and I know it has left him.<eos> You still have a choice.<eos> You can either let the guilt eating away at you take over, or you can trust those who love you.<eos> You must decide today.<eos> Now.<eos> Afterwards might be too late.<eos> Mr Lanester. Could you please stay for a bit?<eos> Delphine went back home.<eos> Things should work out now.<eos> What about you?
What are you doing?<eos> I'm sorry, I'm looking for my husband.<eos> I know that you guys are super busy but I...<eos> Okay, fine, fine, what is his name?<eos> Will.<eos> Sullivan.<eos> Sullivan.<eos> Burn unit, third floor.<eos> He's not here.<eos> If I ever see you back here again, I'll report you to Homeland.
You're gonna want to see this.<eos> All right, here we go, everybody.<eos> It's breathtaking, isn't it?<eos> They put on that show a couple times a month.<eos> Yeah, I've seen it from my house.<eos> Not like this.<eos> I thought it might give you some perspective.<eos> The most important day in human history is coming, Will.<eos> I just want you and your family to be on the right side of it.<eos> And when I tell you to piss off?
Oh, Teddy.<eos> Any special tricks for us?<eos> They teach you to sit up, beg?<eos> How about I give you the first shot, hmm?<eos> After all, every dog has his day.<eos> Well, your mouth move fast enough.<eos> How about your gun?<eos> What if I told you that you can't hurt the newcomers?<eos> And that they can do anything they want to you?<eos> I never understood why they paired some of you off.
This is basic.<eos> Level one.<eos> You ride out of town, that's when the real demented shit begins.<eos> That's where my man Teddy comes in.<eos> He's like a guide.<eos> Honestly, the guy kind of creeps me out.<eos> Fuck it, he leads us out in the canyons, we get bored, we just use him for target practice.<eos> I don't think we're supposed to be cross the river.<eos> It's too adult for Jacob.<eos> We didn't mean to bother you.
- Sidney John Chambers?<eos> - Yes.<eos> An allegation of sexual assault has been made against you.<eos> You're not obliged to say anything, but what you say may be put in to evidence.<eos> Can't keep you away, can we?<eos> - Married yet, Mr Chambers?<eos> - No.<eos> - Got yourself a girl?<eos> - No.<eos> I bet they're flinging themselves at you.
- Who's made this allegation?<eos> Straight down to business, is it?<eos> Abigail Redmond?<eos> - What's she said?<eos> - Pretty little thing.<eos> Nicely developed.<eos> - Don't tell me you haven't looked.<eos> - What's she said?<eos> Her father came across her diary.<eos> All sorts about you in there, apparently.
Police.<eos> - Where's Daniel Marlowe?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - I know he works here. Where is he?<eos> - I don't know!<eos> Where's he hiding?<eos> Eh?<eos> I take it a bribe won't be enough this time.<eos> Shut up, you bastard.<eos> - I'm arresting you on suspicion of murder.
- If only we had that diary.<eos> - There is no diary, Sidney.<eos> - You don't know that for certain, Geordie.<eos> - It's a fiction.<eos> Like God, the angels and the multitude of the heavenly... whatsits.<eos> Hosts.<eos> Heavenly hosts.<eos> I'll be polishing the brasses.<eos> God help those poor brasses.<eos> I'm sorry if we upset you.
I'd think about it pretty carefully, if I was you.<eos> I haven't got your gear.<eos> Ask Chloe<eos> It didn't take long to throw your girlfriend in it.<eos> Did it? She's not my girlfriend.<eos> Not by choice, I'm guessing.<eos> I dumped her.<eos> I told her she'd get in trouble.<eos> What sort of trouble?<eos> From you
Righto, well you look after yourself, OK?<eos> Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> This prescription belongs to Dr. McKenzie.<eos> Where did you get it?<eos> Doctor in Hobart.<eos> Who?<eos> I don't know, I'm not from there.<eos> Ahem... I can't authorize this.<eos> I'm not asking you to cook up Meth, am I?
They didn't find her?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Renae called everyone in Hobart.<eos> No one's seen her.<eos> What time did you finish up?<eos> Roy told me they're gonna start again at first light.<eos> No one could survive out there in this weather.<eos> She'll be in Hobart, Barb.<eos> She has to be.<eos> How many of you were up there?
Where is she?<eos> My sister?<eos> Tell me!<eos> She's gone, mate.<eos> She was last seen up at the party.<eos> But why would she go to the mill?<eos> That's what we're trying to ascertain.<eos> There's no sign of her vehicle.<eos> Right.<eos> We'll be keeping you informed as much as we can, as anything relevant comes to hand.

She was a baby when I left.<eos> Is that before Roy smuggled you off the island?<eos> He didn't smuggle me anywhere.<eos> - Well, maybe you can explain what happened.<eos> Can you tell us what you and Chloe were fighting about at the party?<eos> There was no fight.<eos> There are witnesses who say the opposite.<eos> - They saw an altercation.<eos> - They're lying.<eos> What about you and Gillian Baxter?
My family was threatened and now my daughter's dead. Come on, come inside.<eos> It must be someone who knows what's up there. What we've done.<eos> No one knows.<eos> Grayson does.<eos> I think it's him.<eos> You have a visitor.<eos> Look, Wendy.<eos> Your daughter's here.<eos> Your mother hasn't moved in years.<eos> Unfortunately, she can't see or hear you.
- Do you feel it when I touch here?<eos> - Yep<eos> - How about here?<eos> - Yeah<eos> - You in any pain?<eos> - Nope<eos> Good.<eos> Well, rest up<eos> Glad you're feeling ok.<eos> I'll leave you both to it.
What dose have you given her?<eos> - 20mg over the previous hour.<eos> -20 mg?<eos> That's enough to drop a camel.<eos> Mum, it's Anna.<eos> How about we put you to bed?<eos> So, what have we got here?<eos> Hello, Wendy.<eos> Heard you've been causing a bit of a ruckus.<eos> Not sure why Bridey thought it was necessary to drag you all of the way in.
You have the wrong wharf for the ferry.<eos> I'm Anna Macy<eos> I know who you are.<eos> Go away, leave me alone.<eos> Please.<eos> - Lofty, please ...<eos> - You're making me late for work<eos> I'm not here to make any trouble.<eos> I just need some help trying to remember some things<eos> I never hurt you.
I'm not here to make any trouble.<eos> I just need some help trying to remember some things<eos> I never hurt you.<eos> I never hurt her.<eos> You said I hurt you.<eos> Did I say that?<eos> - I don't remember<eos> - They put me in jail<eos> Can you tell me exactly what happened that night, please?<eos> Found you at Mother Sullivan's
I just need some help trying to remember some things<eos> I never hurt you.<eos> I never hurt her.<eos> You said I hurt you.<eos> Did I say that?<eos> - I don't remember<eos> - They put me in jail<eos> Can you tell me exactly what happened that night, please?<eos> Found you at Mother Sullivan's<eos> I picked you up.
♪ Papa's gonna buy you a mockingbird ♪<eos> The lights!<eos> ♪ If that mockingbird don't sing ♪<eos> Bright lights<eos> ♪ Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring ♪<eos> Why did he blame you?<eos> He was scared.<eos> Scared?<eos> Of who?<eos> Of you.
For god's sake Anna, I was trying to protect you<eos> You must know that<eos> You arrested him to cover for me<eos> You were a different girl when you came back<eos> You were wild. Crazy, almost.<eos> You think I killed Gillian.<eos> It was all my fault.<eos> All this time ...<eos> You think I killed Gillian?<eos> - I wasn't going to lose both of you!
Dinner's ready, Barb.<eos> I feel like it's all coming to an end.<eos> Hey, boys.<eos> Sorry to hear about the mill.<eos> Bit of a blow for this town.<eos> Understatement of the decade.<eos> Buy you a beer?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Three beers, thanks.<eos> Yeah, been meaning to ask you both.
I'll call it in.<eos> Deb, is there somewhere we can talk?<eos> Nobody knows what it's like to lose a child<eos> The desperate helplessness.<eos> The aching loss.<eos> People look at you like you're contagious.<eos> With some horrible disease they don't want to catch.<eos> But they don't really care.<eos> Now you'll know what it feels like.<eos> Chloe had to pay the price for you all.
I'm afraid he didn't make it.<eos> Of course.<eos> Anyone I ever get close to...<eos> It might comfort you to know that he died in a tremendous amount of pain.
Thank you.<eos> There he is!<eos> The big man, the man with the plan, Detective All-That!<eos> I forgot his name.<eos> - Geils.<eos> - Geils!<eos> Tanner, Hoffman.<eos> We missed you, buddy.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> Oh, and by the way, uh, Lieutenant wants to see you.
Fine.<eos> I'll tell you.<eos> It was meant to be the happiest day of my life.<eos> Officer Tribeca?<eos> Yes, Sergeant Pepper?<eos> I have some bad news.<eos> You're under arrest...<eos> For stealing my heart.<eos> You have the right to remain beautiful.<eos> Anything you say will only make me fall more in love with you.
Good.<eos> You're here.<eos> This is all wrong.<eos> Pull up this floor, change out the chandelier.<eos> And for god's sake, tear down the drapery.<eos> It looks like an orphanage.<eos> I'll get on it right away.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I'm a detective.<eos> I have to ask you...

Remember how everyone around here used to work too hard?<eos> I think it was 20 years ago today,<eos> Sergeant Pepper taught us how to play, and we're a better precinct for it.<eos> But he's gone, and you've got a job to do.<eos> Fine.<eos> No, you're thinking of an Italian ice.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> So, we'd like to get married as soon as possible.<eos> - We're very much in love. - Mm.<eos> Don't I recognize you from somewhere?
And, the bodies you have piled up do not disappear when you bury them away,<eos> out of sight.<eos> And you bring death everywhere.<eos> You scared?<eos> You need your rest, Mr. Bohannon, hmm?<eos> I'll rest soon enough.<eos> Well, I certainly hope you do not mind if I do.<eos> We have a long journey ahead.<eos> Shit.<eos> Ah, I warned you, hmm?
Thank you, devil.<eos> I thought you gave up the ghost.<eos> You'll be all right.<eos> That bullet shattered.<eos> Shrapnel all through your thigh.<eos> Extracted a few fragments, but there's still some deep inside.<eos> Here you go.<eos> I want it out.<eos> All of it.<eos> It's part of you now.
Ten times the price tomorrow.<eos> Here to buy some of that property you sellin'.<eos> We want profit astronomically.<eos> I should have known that family life wasn't for you.<eos> All the death and destruction, everything I done, all that is for naught.<eos> Doubt I'll finish this route.<eos> We're better off here, me and William.<eos> Interesting you would rather be here instead of with your wife and child.<eos> William.<eos> Didn't 'spect we'd be seeing you again.
Hardly the adversary I expected.<eos> Well, it seems like you don't need my services after all, then.<eos> - The bourbon's on the house.<eos> - Hey.<eos> It's not Sunday or a holiday, Psalms.<eos> Why aren't you in the cut, building my railroad?<eos> Four long years I been toiling on your railroad.<eos> Today, I'm busted as the day I was freed.<eos> I come to sell back my deed for whatever I can get.<eos> I did caution you not to tangle in the complicated world of real estate investment.
I could hardly look at her.<eos> She is a beautiful girl.<eos> There's a sadness in her.<eos> You can see it.<eos> There is a strength there, and grace.<eos> We been through drought, Injuns, plague of grasshoppers...<eos> There was also William's first steps.<eos> Christmas.<eos> All the apple pie.<eos> And all of it melts from her eyes... whenever she looks at you.
I pray you learn this.<eos> For without love... you will die a lonely, wretched thing.<eos> And the stray sheep?<eos> Would you deny them the love of their shepherd?<eos> Isaac's gone to water the horses.<eos> Brigham Young hopes you're in church on Sunday morning, front row, so he can bless your marriage.<eos> My father would have wanted me to keep my vow to you.<eos> This ain't your head talking.<eos> William is your son.<eos> It ain't right for me to keep him from you.
Previously on AMC's Hell on Wheels...<eos> The railroad comes first.<eos> That's all we got, you and me.<eos> I have a wife.<eos> Our schemes have left us with no friends.<eos> You need Mickey.<eos> I was hoping for more of a fight from you.<eos> Starting to waste behind a granite wall is not going to make for a very exciting finish.<eos> I would be within reason to fire you.
I am between transactions.<eos> This house was built long before you came in, Maggie.<eos> You knew what you were getting when you waltzed through the door.<eos> What I know is those ranchers are dangerous when they are cornered.<eos> We need to find a way to pay them or we will be hip deep in blood.<eos> And ain't no scheme in the world gonna save us.<eos> Go away.<eos> Ju-Long, let her pass.<eos> Forgive him.<eos> It's not often someone like you frequents our establishment.

No one dies.<eos> But you can puck Mr. Durant, all right?<eos> Now, that's a job I can get behind.<eos> Good man.<eos> He's it, not me.<eos> Ms. Strobridge.<eos> Take your brood inside for a moment.<eos> Anything you gotta say to me, you can say to us.<eos> Well, I think it'd be better if we spoke in private.<eos> Better for you, or better for us, Mr. Huntington?
We'll need it vacated upon your departure.<eos> - You're taking our house?<eos> - Hanna.<eos> I suspect you need it ready for my replacement.<eos> It's your choice, Jim.<eos> I was your only friend.<eos> Never mind about the train tickets.<eos> We can make our own way.<eos> Very well.<eos> The Central Pacific thanks you for your service, sir.

Do they not hold a similar allure?<eos> I take things one step at a time, Mr. Chang.<eos> Pity.<eos> Your railroad could be the bridge to China.<eos> A new Silk Road.<eos> Not to mention an excellent opportunity for you to expand your business on the back of my herculean labors.<eos> A mutually beneficial arrangement.<eos> Sze Yup ships are already docked at your western terminus.<eos> An exclusive shipping contract is merely a pen stroke away.<eos> So, that's what lies ahead for you, is it?
A mutually beneficial arrangement.<eos> Sze Yup ships are already docked at your western terminus.<eos> An exclusive shipping contract is merely a pen stroke away.<eos> So, that's what lies ahead for you, is it?<eos> A Pacific shipping empire?<eos> A man who desires only one thing will never be satisfied.<eos> Must be why I'm always smiling.<eos> Car's still mine for the rest of the day.<eos> I got a live charge on the wall.<eos> I don't work for you anymore, Bohannon.
- Aren't you, mon petit chou?<eos> - Guilty, mon coeur!<eos> Pretend you have some manners, for the lady's sake.<eos> Don't insult me.<eos> Were we not in the company of said lady, I would call you what you are.<eos> What's that?<eos> A jackass, my dear.<eos> All right, you win.<eos> And we thank you very kindly, sir.<eos> Mr. Durant, thank you.
- Christ if I know.<eos> Uh... I'd start anyplace that sells liquor or whores.<eos> He could still be in Wyoming.<eos> He could be in New York.<eos> Uh, California...<eos> Ireland.<eos> He could be anywhere.<eos> I don't know.<eos> One thing's gnawing at me.<eos> Why didn't he kill you?
I know I am.<eos> I'm free to go, I assume.<eos> I know what happened out there.<eos> I know the whole story.<eos> I can't prove it.<eos> But I know it.<eos> I've told you the whole story.<eos> There's nothing else to know.<eos> That $50,000...<eos> She sold her hotel to save you.
Rando Yaguchi, Deputy Director, Cabinet Minister of State for Special Missions Giant Unidentified Creature Unified Response Task Force HQ Bureau Chief No, I'm here to take the fall, if needed.<eos> Akasaka's a shrewd delegator.<eos> You're the next new aide to the PM on a career track.<eos> What's wrong with that?<eos> Why'd you become a politician?<eos> 'Couse it's just friend or foe.<eos> I like the simplicity.<eos> Bureau members have arrived.<eos> Special Disaster Bureau Provisional HQ Office<eos> It's great to see you all.
Special Disaster Bureau Provisional HQ Office<eos> It's great to see you all.<eos> Over half of our team has returned.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Our hearts are heavy for those we lost.<eos> Let's do it for them.<eos> We'll fill their positions. While we struggle with the lost of colleagues and loved ones.<eos> We can prevail!<eos> For our countrymen.<eos> I ask you to pour heart and soul into completing our work.

Fine, but I'm not bringing you coffee.<eos> I, uh, read about Dr. Isles' abduction.<eos> I'm guessing that's why you're here.<eos> You find it difficult to see someone you care about in danger?<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> It's ... it's... hard to see a-a strong woman like Maura, you know, just... crippled by fear and anxiety. It's...<eos> She's starting to lose her confidence. She's second-guessing herself.<eos> Dr. Isles is not my client.<eos> You are.<eos> - I'm asking about you.
- That's what I told her.<eos> - Do you have any useful information, or are you just trolling the halls, causing problems?<eos> Wally Johnson and Todd Davis' phone records.<eos> They were in the area of all of the out-of-state robberies.<eos> - But not the Pot Palace?<eos> - I went to Brockton this morning.<eos> Wally and Todd checked into the Motel 24 the night of the robbery, left the next morning.<eos> Pizza delivery guy I.D.'d 'em from their photos.<eos> So the Pot Palace wasn't them.<eos> Lieutenant Martinez left this for you at the front desk.
I don't know.<eos> I ...<eos> Yes.<eos> I-I-I probably had my phone on me.<eos> I...<eos> No.<eos> No, I-I definitely left it in my desk when I came back from the prison.<eos> Are you sure they know I'm involved?<eos> No.<eos> I would never tell them about you.
- No.<eos> After I filed the restraining order, we never saw him again.<eos> - Uh, he lives in Philadelphia now.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> He entered a residential treatment facility for anger management.<eos> He sent me these letters apologizing for his behavior.<eos> He says it's part of the program.<eos> - The postmark says Philadelphia.<eos> - This one was sent a week ago.<eos> Uh, if it's all right with you, we'd like to put you into protective custody.
No connection to Framingham prison.<eos> He's too young to be the person behind all this.<eos> - I agree. - Joe Harris was a psychiatrist used to working with convicts.<eos> When I heard him on the phone, he was talking to someone he had a personal and trusting relationship with.<eos> I don't believe he would have used that tone with this kid.<eos> Yeah, so that means this guy is just a keyboard for hire.<eos> Get comfortable.<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> You guys got nothing on me.<eos> And I could probably actually sue you for, like, false "arrest-ment," or something like that.
There's a bank a block from her apartment.<eos> Maybe he couldn't get treatment without any cash.<eos> You think he'd take a hostage?<eos> _<eos> You're in a tough spot, Nicky.<eos> We can prove that you shot and killed Egon Kronis.<eos> No, but you don't understand.<eos> We understand that you're involved with the Quint Street Boys.<eos> We have your blood at the scene, and we have security video of you running away with a gun.<eos> That's enough to put you away for life.
- This is all my fault.<eos> - Why do you say that?<eos> 'Cause I brought him here for better life.<eos> Look what happened.<eos> I should've known better.<eos> You cannot make it here without connections,<eos> - without education.<eos> - You did.<eos> You made a life for yourself playing by the rules.<eos> I know all about you, Katrin.
Stay with quadrants A and B. She's got the river on one side.<eos> - We covered the road on the other.<eos> - Copy that.<eos> Gun's still holstered, so he didn't feel like he was in danger.<eos> Single gunshot wound to the chest.<eos> Died instantly.<eos> This wasn't a murder.<eos> It was an execution.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> This must be very difficult for you.
- Wait!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Can we all just make sure that our cellphones are off?<eos> Thank you, Jane.<eos> Kiki.<eos> When I'm not with you, I will be waiting for you.<eos> You will always be in my life.<eos> Vince.<eos> How did I get so lucky?<eos> By the power vested in me by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I now pronounce you Vince and Kiki Korsak.
- What?<eos> Where?<eos> - In the same place.<eos> Whoever did this was determined to take him out.<eos> Can I help?<eos> I'm an expert in de-mining.<eos> I-I appreciate the offer, but what would really help is to figure out who killed him.<eos> Can you put together a list of the places you've worked, uh, copies of his e-mails, employee records?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Anyone with a grudge against you is a potential suspect now, all right?
I don't want to be late.<eos> We have tickets to the premiere of I Love Trouble.<eos> Hang on. I want to say hi to Ovitz.<eos> Mike!<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Shapiro?<eos> Sorry to bother you, sir, but you have an emergency phone call.<eos> Emergency?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Robert Shapiro here, who is this?<eos> Bob, I'm glad I found you.
I'm busy with a single mother been shot nine times by LAPD.<eos> - Nine times?<eos> - Nine times.<eos> - Oh... - Tragic, typical, but it ain't sexy, so they kick it to the back of the newspaper.<eos> His lawyer Robert Shapiro is heading his defense team.<eos> Robert Shapiro.<eos> You know him?<eos> Yeah, he's great if you smash your Rolls drunk on Mulholland, but he's a plea bargain guy.<eos> He ain't no litigator.<eos> What if O.J. asked you to help?
The guy his with can anybody tell me who A.C. Cowlings is?<eos> He's a fourth-rate linebacker.<eos> He's sort of a poor man's O.J.<eos> O.J., A.C., get it?<eos> Will you just quiet down?<eos> I feel like I'm gonna vomit.<eos> Pardon me.<eos> I want to say something to the entire community.<eos> Mr. Simpson is a fugitive of justice.<eos> And if any of you assist him, in any way, you are committing a felony.
- Do what I call.<eos> - O.J., O.J., O.J.<eos> - Tell him!<eos> Tell him!<eos> - You need to get out!<eos> That's not happening!<eos> Back off!<eos> - Do we shoot? - I'm not shooting at O.J. Simpson unless somebody authorizes it.<eos> Mr. Simpson is a fugitive from justice.<eos> And if any of you assist him in any way, you are committing felony.
I was with O.J. This morning, and he, uh he was in pretty bad shape.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> He was in a lot of pain.<eos> He left a note.<eos> And we have reason to believe that he's killed himself.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> He wanted you to know, he wanted all of you to know he loved you... he loved you very much.
I just wanted to say how sorry I am.<eos> I didn't mean for you guys to all have to come out like this.<eos> I know it's late on a Friday.<eos> You guys work hard.<eos> Probably want to go home and see your kids.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> We're just doing our jobs.<eos> So, uh...<eos> I understand you have a gun.<eos> Yeah, but it's not for you.
Gentlemen.<eos> Johnnie, I want you to meet everyone.<eos> You know Lee.<eos> Alan, Johnnie, nice to see you.
Well, I'm not black.<eos> I'm O.J.<eos> What is that there?<eos> Okay, well, I've filed the motion petition...<eos> Come on, Carl, I-I'm trying to work with this.<eos> I'll tell you what, why don't we go back to this section.<eos> Okay.<eos> What do you got?<eos> What do you got?<eos> Mr. Cochran, O.J. Simpson is calling for you.
I don't want to stay on the line.<eos> He's gonna beat the shit out of me.<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> Just stay on the line...<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> So we can know what's going on till the police get there, okay?<eos> Just a moment.<eos> Does he have any weapons?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Has he hit you today or no?
I've always admired you and wanted to work with you for years.<eos> Thank you, Bob.<eos> That's kind of you.<eos> I feel a strong emotional connection to this case.<eos> I'm so glad you feel this way.<eos> It's excellent.<eos> But I-I... I feel that I owe you the utmost clarity on one issue.<eos> And that is, I will remain lead counsel.<eos> This case could accomplish a lot of important things.<eos> I'm excited for you, for us.
And who talks to the police?<eos> Our lawyer.<eos> That's right.<eos> Officer, I'm just gonna get my registration.<eos> Please keep your hands on the wheel, sir.<eos> Where you headed tonight?<eos> Just taking my daughters to dinner.<eos> May I ask why you pulled me over?<eos> You seemed to change lanes without signaling two blocks back.<eos> Oh, I-I assure you, I always signal.
- Is this your father's car? - Hey, hey.<eos> - Don't talk to my children.<eos> - Sir...<eos> Look, I know the drill.<eos> I'm black.<eos> I'm driving in a fancy white neighborhood, nice car, you pull me over.<eos> So leave my children out of it, thank you!<eos> - Sir, out of the car now. - Oh, come on!<eos> Got to be kidding me!<eos> Sir, because of your hostile attitude, I'm gonna have to cuff you.
The truth is, the LAPD rushed to judgment in targeting O.J. The mere fact that we find blood where there should be no blood is devastating proof.<eos> Look, the haphazard manner in which the evidence was collected and handled gives us a significant advantage.<eos> I've seen it before.<eos> Officers start down a misguided path and refuse to turn back.<eos> Then somebody realizes they need a better case.<eos> We have motive, evidence and opportunity.<eos> Evidence doesn't win the day.<eos> Jurors go with the narrative that makes sense.<eos> We're here to tell a story. Our job is to tell that story better than the other side tells theirs.<eos> He would take it better if it came from you.
And so what did you do next at Rockingham, after seeing the blood in the Bronco?<eos> At that point, we went from the intention of notifying Mr. Simpson of the death of his ex-wife to a concern that his residence might be a crime scene.<eos> We were concerned for the well-being of Mr. Simpson himself.<eos> Thank you, Detective.<eos> Good morning, Detective.<eos> And a question.<eos> Is it a normal procedure for three detectives to rush from an ongoing crime scene investigation to the home of the former spouse of the victim simply to notify that person that someone whom they used to be married to has been killed?<eos> Well, every situation is different.<eos> And there were children involved.<eos> And at the Bundy scene, didn't Detective Fuhrman inform you that Mr. Simpson and the victim had a history of domestic violence?

Well, I'm sure that.<eos> Johnnie's associates will arrange a briefing for you every day.<eos> All right, okay, fine.<eos> Y'all go.<eos> I'm done with you.<eos> When I have pent-up anger, what I use is boxing...<eos> When I want to hear from you I'll rattle my zipper.<eos> Now get the hell out of here, Bob.<eos> What do you really want, Marcia?<eos> I'll do anything for you.
What do you really want, Marcia?<eos> I'll do anything for you.<eos> Something different.<eos> Softer.<eos> I've never had to think about anything like this before, so...<eos> I'm a little nervous.<eos> The only thing you need to be is the best version of yourself.<eos> And that's what we're here to discover.<eos> I've got it.<eos> I did it for Farrah, and I'm gonna do it for you.
Morning, Gil.<eos> Gil?<eos> We've barely recovered from the Rodney King riots two years ago, and now you and Johnnie are standing in a goddamn pool of gasoline playing with matches; it's all gonna happen again.<eos> It's gonna be on you.
W-We got to be patient.<eos> The truth will find us.<eos> It always does.<eos> There's something on the TV.<eos> I think you better see it.<eos> Can't you record it?<eos> Johnnie, Barbara is on A Current Affair.<eos> With Patricia.<eos> Both of them.<eos> Patricia, you took Johnnie's name, even though he never married you.
You turn over control of a demonstration to the opponent, you don't know what's going to happen.<eos> And certainly not to the defendant himself.<eos> Okay?<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Do you think there's any way that these two gloves could not be a pair?<eos> I'd have to say it would be virtually impossible.<eos> All right, at this time, we will take a 15-minute recess.<eos> Hello, Mike.<eos> Bob.<eos> Are any of you interested in something other than a conspiracy theory?
Now listen up, all of you.<eos> When you're supposed to be at chow by 7:00 p.m., that means 7:00 p.m.<eos> 7:05, not 7:09.<eos> Who the hell is you supposed to be?<eos> Where's Deputy Adam?<eos> Ma'am, please check the tone of your voice before I have to arrest you.
- Okay, I'll...<eos> - And that will be reviewed and returned to you if appropriate.<eos> Okay, ladies and gentlemen, listen up.<eos> This sequester has very simple rules.<eos> You're not to talk about the case with anyone.<eos> That includes each other.<eos> You're not to talk to the other hotel guests at any time, for any reason.<eos> Once in the hotel, you will not be permitted to leave your floor.<eos> You're not allowed in another juror's room for any reason.<eos> Deputies will be on duty in the halls and elsewhere to supervise you at all times.
Deputy Adam, you need to find more time for your family.<eos> How are Christine and the baby?<eos> How are they doing?<eos> - She's great.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Christine's complaining about baby weight, but I think she's beautiful.<eos> Look at that... she's beautiful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Knox.<eos> Judge Ito needs to see you in his chambers.
Another one.<eos> Who?<eos> Yes!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No, man!<eos> No!<eos> Yes?<eos> Thank you.<eos> 462, um, the reason why I asked you here today is that the Sheriff's Department reviewed some court records, and it appears that you once accused your husband of abusing you physically?
During voir dire, she said she once turned an entire jury from 11 to one not guilty to 12-zero for conviction.<eos> She's a nightmare.<eos> Juror 1290's our Holy Grail.<eos> God, we need her.<eos> A voice in deliberation who's going to focus on the facts.<eos> And have you seen the way she looks at Johnnie?<eos> Okay.<eos> So, who else is gonna be a problem?<eos> Juror 2017.<eos> The judge would like to see you.
200?<eos> Really?<eos> When?<eos> Seems like yesterday.<eos> But understand this:<eos> things change really slowly down South.<eos> And I know the Carolinas like I know the caramel color in a single-barrel apple brandy, sipped over the blush of the morning sunrise.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Really?<eos> I hired all of you.
Really?<eos> I hired all of you.<eos> You know, whatever.<eos> I don't grovel.<eos> Just make sure you put my name on the brief.<eos> Thank you, Bob.<eos> This is it.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> Here are the transcripts.<eos> The judge will see you gentlemen shortly.
It's evil.<eos> But this is what black people have always known.<eos> And now it's right here.<eos> For everyone to hear.<eos> Your Honor, it would be a travesty if these tapes were not allowed into the O.J. Simpson trial.<eos> These tapes are tangible evidence of the Los Angeles Police Department's racism.<eos> They are a revelation of truth.<eos> May I approach the bench, Your Honor?<eos> No, you cannot.<eos> Your Honor, with all due respect, we ask you to enforce this subpoena and compel Ms. McKinny to turn over the tapes.

My job is to defend Ron and Nicole.<eos> The victims.<eos> But the bottom line is not Fuhrman.<eos> It's the concrete evidence.<eos> The defense just wants to inflame the jury so they forget about the facts and vote emotionally.<eos> I hope this very cynical view will be proven wrong and the jury will rise to the occasion and say, "No.<eos> We are going to look at the evidence."<eos> Because the rest of this stuff is irrelevant.<eos> I submit these cases... numerous cases... where racial epithets were deemed immaterial.<eos> I beg of you, Your Honor, act on precedent.

And the court has allowed them to walk all over...<eos> Mr. Darden, you are close to being held in contempt!<eos> Well, I should be held in contempt!<eos> There is nothing funny here!<eos> Mr. Darden.<eos> Chris, calm down.<eos> Don't.<eos> Mr. Darden!<eos> Mr. Darden!<eos> I am warning you.
Mr. Darden is simply responding to the unfair events that have occurred in this courtroom today and other days.<eos> The court has been exploited by counsel for cross-purposes.<eos> Ms. Clark, I think perhaps you need to take ten deep breaths, for you also are about to be held in contempt.<eos> Shall I take off my watch and jewelry?<eos> Your Honor? Perhaps some of my comments may have been, um, uh, somewhat inappropriate.<eos> I apologize to the court.<eos> I meant no disrespect.<eos> All right, Mr. Darden, I accept your apology.<eos> I apologize to you for my reaction as well.<eos> You and I have known each other for a number of years, and I know that your response was out of character, so thank you.
No justice!<eos> No peace!<eos> No justice!<eos> No peace!<eos> No justice!<eos> No peace!<eos> No justice!<eos> No peace...<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Let's go, after you.
As much as I'd like to address some of the misrepresentations made about myself and my Nicole, concerning our life together, I am mindful of the mood and the stamina of this jury.<eos> I am confident... a lot more, it seems, than Miss Clark... About their integrity, and that they will find, as it now stands, that I did not and could not and would not commit this crime.<eos> I have four kids.<eos> Two kids I haven't seen in a year.<eos> And every week, they ask me, "Dad, when are you coming home?<eos> How much longer?"<eos> - All right...<eos> - Just want this trial to be over.<eos> - All right, thank you, Mr. Simpson.<eos> - Thank you, Your Honor.

Today, the trial of the century reaches a crescendo as closing statements begin.<eos> Vegas oddsmakers are offering six-to-five in favor of conviction.<eos> Marcia.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Please, nail this.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, we are coming close to the end, I promise.<eos> And I want you all to know how much I appreciate what you're doing here... For justice...<eos> And to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for the incredible sacrifices that you've made.
Should LAPD ever have hired him?<eos> No.<eos> Should such a person be a police officer?<eos> No.<eos> In fact, do we wish there were no such person on the planet?<eos> Yes.<eos> But the fact that Mark Fuhrman is a racist and lied about it on the witness stand does not mean that we haven't proven that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.<eos> And it would be a tragedy if O.J. Simpson were found not guilty because of the racist attitudes of one police officer.<eos> There is an ocean of evidence that has been unchallenged by the defense.<eos> In an attempt to distract you from it, they took you through a twisted road.

Vacation talk? Whew.<eos> I need one.<eos> Heading to the airport.<eos> I got a speech in San Francisco.<eos> You know what I would do, if I had the spare time?<eos> I would go up to Oscar De La Hoya's training camp and I would spend my day sparring and-and hitting the heavy bag.<eos> Bob, airport.<eos> Okay.<eos> I've never been a foreperson before.<eos> I've never even been on a jury before, so if any of you have suggestions, I'm open to hearing them.

Look.<eos> I want you to know I admire you for what you did.<eos> For what? For botching an air-tight case?<eos> For... for making the case for the people of California.<eos> Given what they threw at you, there were a lot of temptations to play their game.<eos> And you didn't.<eos> We are all profoundly disappointed with this verdict.<eos> But it was clear to me and to the prosecution that this was an emotional trial.<eos> And apparently, the jury's decision was based on... emotion and not reason.<eos> None of you will know the sacrifices that this team and their families made.
It's the best we could find at the market.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, darling.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> From the very beginning, you encouraged me to do it.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And to you, brother, the whole way.<eos> To you all, thank you.<eos> To you, for the journey.
Oh, and there's a woman.<eos> Yeah.<eos> A woman.<eos> Who I love.<eos> And I got close.<eos> In the bleak midwinter...<eos> At some point in the near future Mr Churchill will want to speak to you in person, Mr Shelby.<eos> He has a job for you.
I promise.<eos> No guns in the house and Charles will never see one.<eos> I love you, Thomas Shelby.<eos> You keep us safe.<eos> I love you.<eos> And I promise I will make us safe.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, you may now join.<eos> Gatehouse.<eos> Come on.<eos> Tommy, Arthur, Collins, may I introduce you to the Grand Duchess Tatiana Petrovna... .. from Tbilisi, Georgia?

- Looking for Esme.<eos> - Right.<eos> Ruben Oliver.<eos> Portrait artist.<eos> I really enjoyed the depiction of you in the dining room.<eos> Nice to meet you, Mr Oliver.<eos> Danny, ragtime.<eos> So, where were we?<eos> - Crimea.<eos> - I mean before I bored you with war.
- Yes.<eos> You are the only one in your family who is a communist.<eos> Some of them are, they just don't know it.<eos> And you are very close family, yes?<eos> Mm, always within punching distance.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means yeah, we're a close family.<eos> Arthur?<eos> I do apologise for the interruption.<eos> There is a woman here to see you, Mr Kaledin.
- You think you're a free man now?<eos> You still follow orders.<eos> Just because your master has silver hair and tits doesn't mean she's not a master.<eos> Friends, friends, friends, please.<eos> There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing.<eos> That is the way of the world.<eos> I'm not here to change the way of the world.<eos> Slavery is the way of our world.<eos> You don't need slaves to make money.<eos> There haven't been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you.
They're trustworthy if they're convinced that working with me is in their self-interest.<eos> You don't know them. You don't understand them.<eos> We are not human in their eyes.<eos> They look at me and see a weapon.<eos> They look at her and see a whore.<eos> They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast.<eos> Their contempt is their weakness.<eos> They'll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage.<eos> You will not use them.<eos> They will use you.
That is what they do.<eos> You all right?<eos> Why don't you sit and catch your breath?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I don't think you could ride the dragon.<eos> 20 years ago, maybe.<eos> - What?<eos> - Our queen.<eos> She's wild, you know.<eos> Don't let her size fool you.
All we can do is try.<eos> No.<eos> We can do more than that.<eos> And you're going to help me.<eos> If I were to let you leave right now, where would you go?<eos> What would you seek out?<eos> I'd go to my brother, my husband, my family.<eos> Of course, but for you, that means seeking out money, finery, power.<eos> Seeking out your family means seeking out sin.<eos> I'm not maligning you.
Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?<eos> No, but if the king should call...<eos> The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything.<eos> When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaery's back at Tommen's side, do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?<eos> You hate these fanatics as much as we do.<eos> You hate what they've done to your son.<eos> Do you want Lancel back?<eos> Or have you given him up for good?<eos> Of course I want him back.<eos> Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.
But he talked.<eos> They all do.<eos> He told me everything.<eos> All about the Stark boys, who helped them escape, and how she did it.<eos> Open the gate!<eos> Sorry about the food.<eos> It's not what we're known for.<eos> That's all right.<eos> There are more important things.<eos> A letter for you, Lord Commander.
Yes?<eos> For you, my lady.<eos> How far is Mole's Town?<eos> Sansa.<eos> Lady Brienne.<eos> When I heard you had escaped Winterfell, I feared the worst.<eos> You have no idea how happy I am to see you unharmed.
If you did know, you're my enemy.<eos> Would you like to hear about our wedding night?<eos> He never hurt my face.<eos> He needed my face, the face of Ned Stark's daughter.<eos> But the rest of me, he did what he liked with the rest of me as long as I could still give him an heir.<eos> What do you think he did?<eos> I can't begin to contemplate--<eos> What do you think he did to me?<eos> Lady Sansa asked you a question.<eos> He beat you.
I made a mistake, a horrible mistake.<eos> I underestimated a stranger.<eos> The other things he did, ladies aren't supposed to talk about those things, but I imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time.<eos> I can still feel it.<eos> I don't mean in my tender heart it still pains me so.<eos> I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You said you would protect me.<eos> And I will.<eos> You must believe me when I tell you that I will.
I don't mean in my tender heart it still pains me so.<eos> I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You said you would protect me.<eos> And I will.<eos> You must believe me when I tell you that I will.<eos> I don't believe you anymore.<eos> I don't need you anymore.<eos> You can't protect me.<eos> You won't even be able to protect yourself if I tell Brienne to cut you down.
And why shouldn't I?<eos> Do you want me to beg for my life?<eos> If that's what you want, I will.<eos> Whatever you ask that is in my power, I will do.<eos> What if I want you to die here and now?<eos> Then I will die.<eos> You freed me from the monsters who murdered my family and you gave me to other monsters who murdered my family.<eos> Go back to Moat Cailin.<eos> My brother and I will take back the North on our own.<eos> I never want to see you again.
No!<eos> No!<eos> It was you.<eos> You made the white walkers.<eos> We were at war.<eos> We were being slaughtered.<eos> Our sacred trees cut down.<eos> We needed to defend ourselves.<eos> From whom?<eos> From you.
How long does it take?<eos> I don't know that either.<eos> But I've seen what happens when it goes far enough.<eos> I'll end things before that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Don't be.<eos> All I've ever wanted was to serve you.<eos> Tyrion Lannister was right.<eos> I love you.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> That's about the extent of my Valyrian.<eos> Thank you for travelling all this way.<eos> I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.<eos> The truth is we need your help.<eos> We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to--
They're not Northern, but they will back us against the Boltons without question.<eos> I didn't know the Tullys still had an army.<eos> My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it and retaken Riverrun.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.<eos> That's good.<eos> The Blackfish is a legend.<eos> His support would mean a great deal.<eos> Stark, Tully, a few more houses, almost starts to look like a winning side.<eos> I've sworn to protect you, my lady.

We need more men and my uncle has an army.<eos> We can send the Blackfish a raven.<eos> Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it.<eos> It has to be you.<eos> Ride for Riverrun.<eos> My uncle will talk to you and you'll know how to talk to him.

And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they?<eos> Already out looking for a leader with better prospects.<eos> And that wildling fellow with the beard--<eos> Jon isn't Tormund.<eos> Jon isn't Davos, the Red Woman or Stannis for that matter.<eos> Jon is Jon.<eos> He's my brother.<eos> He'll keep me safe.<eos> I trust him.<eos> Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?
I'll wager you still can't sit a horse or wield a sword.<eos> Randyll, to be maester of the Night's Watch is a great honor.<eos> He can wield a sword.<eos> He killed a Thenn.<eos> He killed a white walker.<eos> There's no such thing.<eos> I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black.<eos> He drove a dagger into the walker's heart.<eos> He risked his own life to save mine more than once.<eos> He's a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.
I remember when the players came to my village.<eos> I didn't have any money, so I snuck in.<eos> Just like you.<eos> Saw the painted faces, the costumes, listened to the songs, cried when the young lovers died in each other's arms.<eos> I ran off and joined them the next day, never looked back.<eos> You're very good.<eos> My final speech is shit.<eos> But to be fair to myself, which I always like to be, the writing's no good.<eos> So change it.<eos> It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you.
She would be angry.<eos> She would want to kill the person who did this to her.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Mercy.<eos> You have very expressive eyes, Mercy.<eos> Wonderful eyebrows.<eos> Do you like pretending to be other people?<eos> I have to go.<eos> My father's waiting for me.<eos> Lady Crane, they loved you.
Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods' mercy?<eos> You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years.<eos> And you will continue to do so.<eos> But not in this city.<eos> You've lost it?<eos> Yes, Father.<eos> It's a castle, not a bloody sheep.<eos> Presumably you still know where it is.<eos> You didn't lose Riverrun.<eos> You let the Blackfish take it from you.
We've got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish.<eos> The Mallisters have risen against us.<eos> And the Blackwoods.<eos> The Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us, raiding our supply trains and camps.<eos> Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year.<eos> If I want excuses, I'll put her in charge.<eos> They're laughing at us.<eos> All across the Riverlands right down to King's Landing, they're laughing at us.<eos> I hear it in my sleep!<eos> I'm not dead yet, unfortunately for you.
It stretched all the way to the horizon.<eos> And look at us now.<eos> Look what's left of us.<eos> And if we lose this, we're gone.<eos> Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations.<eos> Be like we were never there at all.<eos> We'll be the last of the free folk.<eos> That's what'll happen to you if we lose.<eos> The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you're here.<eos> They know that more than half of you are women and children.
And if that's what we are, we deserve to be the last of the free folk.<eos> Snow.<eos> Are you sure they'll come?<eos> We're not clever like you southerners.<eos> When we say we'll do something, we do it.<eos> I heard you were leaving King's Landing.<eos> That is hardly your concern.<eos> Your grandson is still a prisoner.<eos> You'll leave him rotting in a cell?<eos> Loras rots in a cell because of you.

We must defend them.<eos> I'm leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells.<eos> If you're half as bright as you think you are, you'll find a way out of here, too.<eos> Never.<eos> I'll never leave my son.<eos> What'll you do, then?<eos> You have no support.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Your brother's gone. The High Sparrow saw to that.<eos> The rest of your family have abandoned you.

And where were you?<eos> Running and hiding like a fucking coward.<eos> Yield the castle or I cut his throat.<eos> Go on, then.<eos> Cut his throat.<eos> Lothar, is it?<eos> Ser Jaime.<eos> We didn't know you were coming.<eos> 'Cause you didn't set a proper perimeter. You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged.<eos> Good thing we're friends or we'd be fucking you in the ass right now.
House Mormont.<eos> And?<eos> We sent ravens to Houses Manderly--<eos> I don't care about ravens.<eos> You're asking me to join your army.<eos> Who is fighting in this army?<eos> The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.<eos> Then the rumors are true.<eos> I didn't dare believe them.<eos> I received you out of respect for your father.
Now, pay attention.<eos> You put your left hand on the back of the lady's head.<eos> Your right hand holds the small of the lady's back like so.<eos> Very romantic.<eos> Take your middle finger, yeah, and you jam it right up her bunghole.<eos> So fucking close!<eos> Ah, it smells like pussy to me.<eos> Look at him.<eos> You get hard, boy?<eos> Fuck you!
She has to.<eos> My heart's been broken too many times already.<eos> I'll walk the rest of the way myself.<eos> I can't go off on a secret mission in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city.<eos> Varys.<eos> The most famous dwarf in the world.<eos> Your Grace, several members of the Faith Militant have been permitted entry to the Red Keep.<eos> Have been permitted?<eos> That's rather a tortured way of putting it.<eos> They demand to see you, Your Grace.
The Tully army.<eos> They're a bit occupied at the moment.<eos> I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels, so you can see the conundrum.<eos> The Tullys are rebels because they're fighting for their home?<eos> Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.<eos> As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.<eos> Exactly.<eos> We shouldn't argue about politics.<eos> You're a knight, Ser Jaime.<eos> I know there is honor in you.
- They die.<eos> - We all bloody die.<eos> Except this one here.<eos> I'll only gut one of them.<eos> No.<eos> I'll chop off one hand.<eos> We gave you two of the three out of respect for your loss.<eos> That's generous.<eos> Bunch of nancies.<eos> There was a time I would have killed all seven of you just to gut these three.
Despite appearances, I think you'll find the city's on the rise.<eos> Perhaps we should take shelter.<eos> The city's on the rise?<eos> Meereen is strong.<eos> Commerce has returned to the markets.<eos> The people are behind you.
The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder.<eos> The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.<eos> We obviously didn't communicate clearly.<eos> We're here to discuss your surrender, not mine.<eos> I imagine it's difficult adjusting to the new reality.<eos> Your reign is over.<eos> My reign has just begun.<eos> Dracarys.<eos> Your men have a choice:<eos> fight and die for masters who would never fight and die for you, or go home to your families.
Dracarys.<eos> Your men have a choice:<eos> fight and die for masters who would never fight and die for you, or go home to your families.<eos> Thank you for the armada.<eos> Our queen does love ships.<eos> Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact.<eos> You violated that pact.<eos> You declared war upon us.<eos> Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven.<eos> Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.
I want him coming at us full tilt.<eos> We should all get some sleep.<eos> Rest, Jon Snow.<eos> We need you sharp tomorrow.<eos> So you've met the enemy, drawn up your battle plans.<eos> Aye, for what they're worth.<eos> You've known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around making your plans on how to defeat a man you don't know.<eos> I lived with him.<eos> I know the way his mind works. I know how he likes to hurt people.<eos> Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?
So why shouldn't I wait for him?<eos> The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing.<eos> He also wants to give you...<eos> His big cock, I think he said.<eos> Euron's offer is also an offer of marriage, you see.<eos> You won't get one without the other.<eos> And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?<eos> I never demand, but I'm up for anything, really.<eos> He murdered our father and would have murdered us.<eos> He'll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.
You talk about war as if you're an expert, but the one battle I remember you fighting, you were captured by Robb Stark, the Young Wolf.<eos> But it doesn't matter.<eos> Here we are now, two kingslayers.<eos> We know what it's like to have them grovel to our faces and snigger behind our backs.<eos> We don't mind, do we?<eos> Fear is a marvelous thing.<eos> They don't fear the Freys, though.<eos> They fear the Lannisters.<eos> We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands.<eos> If we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them, why do we need you?
Do you have anything to say for yourself?<eos> I've been ready to die for many years.<eos> If the Lord was done with me, so be it, but he's not.<eos> You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow.<eos> You know the great war is still to come.<eos> You know the army of the dead will be upon us soon.<eos> And you know I can help you win that war.<eos> Ride south today.<eos> If you return to the North, I'll have you hanged as a murderer.<eos> If you ever come back this way, I will execute you myself.
Jon.<eos> A raven came from the Citadel.<eos> A white raven.<eos> Winter is here.<eos> Well, Father always promised, didn't he?<eos> The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne, he was assassinated.<eos> 100 red scorpions, was it?<eos> You have nothing to fear from us, Lady Olenna.<eos> You murder your own prince, but you expect me to trust you?<eos> We invited you to Dorne because we needed your help.
Bay of Dragons?<eos> We can't call it Slaver's Bay anymore, can we?<eos> You'll get that throne you want so badly, I'm sure of it.<eos> I hope it brings you happiness.<eos> I pity the lords of Westeros.<eos> They have no idea what's coming for them.<eos> Farewell, Daario Naharis.<eos> How did he take it?<eos> No tears.<eos> I know it was hard for you.

Good.<eos> You're in the great game now.<eos> And the great game's terrifying.<eos> The only people who aren't afraid of failure are madmen like your father.<eos> Do you know what frightens me?<eos> I said farewell to a man who loves me.<eos> A man I thought I cared for.<eos> And I felt nothing.<eos> Just impatient to get on with it.<eos> He wasn't the first to love you and he won't be the last.
And I felt nothing.<eos> Just impatient to get on with it.<eos> He wasn't the first to love you and he won't be the last.<eos> Well, you have completely failed to console me.<eos> For what it's worth, I've been a cynic for as long as I can remember.<eos> Everyone's always asking me to believe in things-- family, gods, kings, myself.<eos> It was often tempting until I saw where belief got people.<eos> So I said no, thank you to belief.<eos> And yet here I am.<eos> I believe in you.
News of this battle will spread quickly through the Seven Kingdoms.<eos> I've declared for House Stark for all to hear.<eos> You've declared for other houses before, Lord Baelish.<eos> It's never stopped you from serving yourself.<eos> The past is gone for good.<eos> You can sit here mourning its departure or you can prepare for the future.<eos> You, my love, are the future of House Stark.<eos> Who should the North rally behind?<eos> A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark born here at Winterfell or a motherless bastard born in the south?<eos> This is where I leave you.
Get up!<eos> ♪♪<eos> It's a girl.<eos> Look.<eos> - I can't believe it.<eos> Is that the princess?<eos> I thought you were teaching her how to fence?<eos> She was a quick study.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> As king, I welcome you to the Order of the Chosen.
She was a quick study.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> As king, I welcome you to the Order of the Chosen.<eos> At the dawn of every new year, we gather in this sacred garden to recount the story of the Ellcrys.<eos> Thousands of years ago... our Elven ancestors fought a war against an army of Demons.<eos> The Elves were at the point of annihilation, when their elders turned to magic.<eos> Using this powerful gift, they managed to imprison the Demons in a realm known as the Forbidding.<eos> The Ellcrys was created to stand sentry.<eos> As long as it lives, the Demons are locked up for all eternity.<eos> Now, I realize that for some of you, this is merely... folklore.
Well, at least you'll know where she'll be for the next year... locked behind these walls, watering an old tree.<eos> Do you have any respect for Elvin traditions?<eos> Only the ones with parties.<eos> ♪♪ -<eos> ♪♪<eos> It has begun.<eos> ♪♪<eos> Had to go all the way to Olney, but I found white willow bark.<eos> Afraid it won't do any good now.<eos> I'll leave you two alone.
Yes, and I know the tree speaks to you.<eos> Did Lorin tell you that?<eos> Well, not exactly.<eos> What aren't you telling me?<eos> I think it's better if the Druid explains everything.<eos> You're here with a Druid.<eos> I thought they were all dead.<eos> This one just took a very long nap.<eos> Are you his errand boy?<eos> Actually, Allanon brought me along to protect you.
Please...<eos> Wil... you have to trust me.<eos> ♪♪<eos> (pounds staff on floor)<eos> The Elvin Council is called to discuss the crisis of the Ellcrys.<eos> Allanon.<eos> The Ellcrys is dying.<eos> As it sheds its leaves, a Demon army forms, preparing to unleash its evil upon our world.<eos> (council members muttering)<eos> Let me assure you, these Demons are real.
I was wrong.<eos> Yet now he asks us to believe in fairy tales.<eos> For all we know, this is nothing but a plot by the other Races to bring us to our knees.<eos> The Dagda Mor is the only one plotting here.<eos> Demons are your enemies.<eos> And she is your only hope.<eos> We cannot put the fate of the Four Lands and the Elvin people in the hands of this Druid and my niece, whom I love dearly,<eos> but who has run away from her duties once already.<eos> Amberle didn't run away.<eos> She was trying to protect you.
(Wil) Thank you.<eos> Look, I know what you're all thinking.<eos> That the things you're hearing are too incredible to be true.<eos> But magic and demons are real.<eos> I have seen them with my own eyes.<eos> Quite frankly, all I want to do is run away.<eos> Then I met Amberle.<eos> She might have been frightened, but she's also incredibly brave.<eos> She didn't have to come back, but she did,<eos> for all of you, the people she loves.
The cloak's a nice touch, Rover, but your boots gave you away.<eos> (grunting, fighting)<eos> (grunting)<eos> Excellent work, Commander Tilton.<eos> Thank you, Your Grace.<eos> Prince Ander assisted with the apprehension.<eos> If by assisted you mean got his ass kicked, yeah, he was a big help.<eos> Rover, do you have a name?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> We all look the same to you, anyway.
You've earned it.<eos> They're of no use to you.<eos> Oh? And why is that?<eos> You're not an Elf.<eos> I hate to break it to you, Mongrel, but neither are you.<eos> If we don't reach the fort by nightfall, they'll send soldiers after us.<eos> And when they do...<eos> You'll be nothing but ragged flesh and bones.<eos> This is marsh-wolf country.<eos> Once they catch your scent, they'll come running, and they will eat you alive while you watch.
What is that?<eos> She's called a Roc.<eos> I saved her and her partner, Perk.<eos> He's a Wing Rider.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Hold on.<eos> Eretria!<eos> We have to go back!<eos> Bandon?<eos> I've been expecting you.
You are not capable of understanding what you saw!<eos> You're not yourself, Allanon.<eos> The Dagda Mor used the boy to get inside my mind!<eos> The Dagda Mor.<eos> Of course.<eos> The evil everybody fears, but only you can see.<eos> Tell me, Druid, do you often commune with Demons?<eos> What is the meaning of this?<eos> Why conceal a weapon that has the power to protect us?<eos> To protect you?
Maybe you guys didn't notice, but there are three heavily-armed trolls in that room... how are we supposed to get past them?<eos> We've fought worse.<eos> Wait.<eos> Maybe there's another way.<eos> (snorts)<eos> (snorts)<eos> (grunts)<eos> If the Gnome's letter is true, it could turn the tide of war.<eos> Have you told the Council?<eos> No one knows but the two of you.
Now what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But we need to figure it out.<eos> (voices) No one enters, no one leaves... (Amberle) Wait, do you hear that?<eos> (screeching)<eos> No one enters.<eos> No one leaves.<eos> (Eretria) Who are you?<eos> (both) Guardians of the Bloodfire.<eos> Who among you dares to seek
It looks like you made out okay.<eos> No thanks to you.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hey, Mongrel, how far you think you're gonna get before some Troll picks up the scent of your pretty princess, huh?<eos> I can smell her sweetness from here.<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> Do it!<eos> It beats getting eaten by Trolls.<eos> Come on!<eos> Or let me loose and I'll take you straight to Eretria.
No, you weren't.<eos> Eretria...<eos> You came here for the map.<eos> Not for me.<eos> What map?<eos> The map to Safehold.<eos> Now, why don't you fill your boyfriend in while I go get the map?<eos> I'll meet you outside in five minutes.<eos> And if we refuse to leave?<eos> Then I'll tell every Human in here about you.
We've got enough space for your skinny butts.<eos> No, no, we're just grabbing some food to go, while Frank takes a very suspicious post-work shower.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> He's probably just coming from the gym.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Or is he washing off the telltale scent of secretarial-cousin perfume?<eos> You are two sad, old biddies.<eos> No, we're just having fun.<eos> It's perfectly harmless.<eos> That'll be an interesting defense to make just before God pulls the lever that sends you both to hell.
I wanna hear you.<eos> Tonight, we stand together in a vibratory field of an advancing potential, the foundation of which is love.<eos> Love doesn't just happen, we have to choose it.<eos> We are in a phase of evolution where we have to agree with love.<eos> We are in a phase of evolution where we have to embrace love.<eos> We have to see love, feel love, touch love, heal love.<eos> From the very core of our inner sanction.<eos> Right?<eos> You guys know what I'm talking about.<eos> Come on, let me hear you.
That can't be the deal.<eos> That can't be it.<eos> I know it's, like, not appropriate to be standing up here in a bathing suit... but I took an Ambien tonight.<eos> I... I was supposed to go to sleep, but then he called me to come here.<eos> -I'm really sorry.<eos> -Okay... okay.<eos> - So sorry.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So many of you.
We've never kissed. We haven't even touched each other.<eos> Okay, yeah, but you're, like... you know, naked in front of each other.<eos> That's, like, in the realm of, you know, fucking incest.<eos> So, was it incest when we had baths together as little girls?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> That is, like, worlds apart! Okay?<eos> Like, I was touching your boob while I was touching her thigh, okay?<eos> That's, technically, I'm-- I'm in an incestuous relationship right now, okay?<eos> Don't judge us.<eos> I'm not judging you, okay? It's just...
Like, I was touching your boob while I was touching her thigh, okay?<eos> That's, technically, I'm-- I'm in an incestuous relationship right now, okay?<eos> Don't judge us.<eos> I'm not judging you, okay? It's just...<eos> It's a surprise, and in all fairness... you two should've told me.<eos> Okay, dude.<eos> You know what? Sorry that we tried to fuck you.<eos> No.<eos> I... I didn't mean it-- Uh, it's just...<eos> I mean, maybe, like, one of you stays?
Grandfather and my sisters stole your eye, kubo.<eos> They must never find you again.<eos> Never!<eos> You must always stay hidden from the night sky, or they will find you, and they'll take you away from me.<eos> Promise me you will never let this happen.<eos> Promise me, kubo.<eos> Don't be sad, kubo.<eos> Kubo, remember what you must do, kubo.<eos> Remember?<eos> Keep you with me at all times, Mr. Monkey.
No!<eos> What?<eos> Tell me what?<eos> N-n...<eos> Hanzo was my father.<eos> Kubo!<eos> This is a miracle.<eos> I have found the son of my master!<eos> Don't even.<eos> Now, whatever brings you to these lands, whatever your quest, it is now my quest too.

But i...<eos> But I don't remember.<eos> Well, your grandson's a storyteller.<eos> He'll tell you all the stories you've forgotten.<eos> Really?<eos> Of course.<eos> Hello, mother. Father.<eos> I know my stories can tend to get a little... Mm, long...<eos> So I'll keep this brief.<eos> I'm very grateful I've had the chance to meet you both, hear your wisdom.
From the top.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Alice Cooper.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> This is a recording studio, isn't it?<eos> Right, no, of course.<eos> Hey, man, Clark Morelle, American Century.<eos> - Richie Finestra's outfit.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I saw you in Rochester, man, start of the tour.
- Yeah, Eva Marie Snake.<eos> That's... I get that. It's funny.<eos> Whoa, whoa, relax, man. She smells fear.<eos> We'll have a hard time prying her loose.<eos> Norm had to hack the last one off me with an army knife.<eos> I'm taking a mulligan.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hold that.<eos> - Yeah, I got it.<eos> Andy is ready to see you now.
- Jawohl.<eos> You know, "Hogan's Heroes."<eos> This is funny to you?<eos> You know I would never say anything, right?<eos> I mean, look, I don't even know, all right?<eos> This is not what this is about.<eos> I'd actually like to know what he said.<eos> Nothing, really.<eos> You know?<eos> He asked me if I knew you and whether or not I knew if you knew Maury.
Where do I begin?<eos> I think, with your father.<eos> When you ask how I met him, I would say it was on a train<eos> But that wouldn't be enough for you.<eos> I was 25 years old.<eos> It was a wild night and very windy.<eos> Is this seat free?<eos> Yes.<eos> That was a big branch.<eos> Did it frighten you?
Wait, they're saying something...<eos> ...shipwreck of a gabela, Three miles north of the mouth of the Ria of Ferrol.<eos> Its occupant has not yet been located and there are serious fears for his life.<eos> Similarly, there is a pleasure boat<eos> With three crew.<eos> The rough seas with waves over six meters have prevented Civil Protection from being able to help.<eos> As dawn comes and sea conditions improve...<eos> I am the judge Vicente Louro.<eos> In order to move the body, you need to identify it.<eos> I must warn you.
After what happened to you, it might be a good rest.<eos> And Antia is more distracted in Madrid.<eos> - Well...<eos> - Rosa takes care of everything.<eos> You can go for a walk, go to the movies, relax...<eos> Well, I didn't bring any clothes.<eos> But you can use mine!<eos> I have everything.<eos> Dresses, loose shirts that don't fit me<eos> They'll fit you better than me. You can try on whatever you want.
We've come to see the flat for rent.<eos> Just a moment.<eos> Follow me.<eos> The kitchen.<eos> - The wallpaper is a bit much.<eos> - No, the wallpaper is cool.<eos> If we get tired of it, we can paint it.<eos> We are also very close by.<eos> Bea and you found an apartment near where she lived.<eos> I rented it for you.
- No, the wallpaper is cool.<eos> If we get tired of it, we can paint it.<eos> We are also very close by.<eos> Bea and you found an apartment near where she lived.<eos> I rented it for you.<eos> But I couldn't with my heart and soul, But you were as strong as an oak.<eos> You had matured...<eos> You went back and met with Ava, to put the house up for sale.<eos> In Madrid, Bea took care of me.<eos> We just survived without you.
I'm sorry, but I have to go.<eos> You call me, OK?<eos> Don't keep punishing me, Julieta.<eos> Don't I have the right to be happy after the death of your mother?<eos> I'd rather not talk about that.<eos> Remember you are still my daughter and Antia is my granddaughter.<eos> The last time I saw her she was still a child...<eos> Give her kisses when you see her.<eos> I will.<eos> Kisses for you too.
She asked to be sedated.<eos> The reality was very hard.<eos> - Sorry, Lorenzo Gentile.<eos> - We met in the elevator in the hospital.<eos> - See you later.<eos> - I thought to myself: why is this woman so beautiful and so sad.<eos> Surely you must have come to visit someone who was very serious.<eos> I figured it was not our beloved Ava.<eos> To Ava...<eos> Ava talked about you.
I have seen a bear.<eos> - You, at night in the snow.<eos> In your dream.<eos> Learning prefer harder instead of hanging out in the woods.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Tom, pack the honey?<eos> When you stay will'm doing good. Thanks.<eos> No thanks.<eos> You do not seem very enthusiastic.<eos> - Why should I live with you?
Now with Tom.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Ready?<eos> On your mark, start.<eos> Bravo.<eos> - You, he's strong.<eos> What's for dinner? "<eos> - No idea.<eos> I waited for you.
A call from the army.<eos> They come here.<eos> Shit, you do not mean.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> I'm the social worker of the regiment.<eos> Present rifle.<eos> Turn left.<eos> Down pillows.<eos> Captain Nathan Delille...<eos> On behalf of the Secretary of Defense... We distinguish you with the Cross of Merit.

We distinguish you with the Cross of Merit.<eos> Captain Nathan Delille...<eos> On behalf of the President of the Republic... We appoint you a knight in the Legion of Honor.
Come on.<eos> Do your little sister's fixed.<eos> - No.<eos> Of course.<eos> Come here and hold her.<eos> Stand there.<eos> Come on, baby. Come on.<eos> You see.<eos> He says nothing.<eos> I'll leave you together.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm excited.<eos> Yeah, good.<eos> Who's the guy with the beard and the long hair who showed up in the Porsche?<eos> That guy.<eos> That one.<eos> Oh, um, I-I can't remember his name, but I know that he splits the Porsche with somebody.<eos> What about the guy with the cane and the eye patch?<eos> Jesus, your faces!<eos> Excuse you?
- What's happened?<eos> - We're engaged!<eos> I have to tell you that the Minister of War is very busy and may not be able to see you this evening.<eos> It's imperative that he does.<eos> I've come directly from the battlefield.<eos> My orders were to report to the Austrian Emperor himself.<eos> No, no, this is not how we do things here, your Excellency.<eos> I'll have to have a word with the Minister.<eos> He's asked to see the Emperor.<eos> He will see you now.
Don't get up.<eos> Please don't let me interrupt you, sir.<eos> Count Nikolai Rostov, Prince Andrei Bolkonsky.<eos> Please go on.<eos> You were in the cavalry charge in Schongrabern, you say?<eos> Yes, I was there.<eos> Yes. There are many stories told of that action.<eos> Perhaps, but the stories told by the men who were actually there, under enemy fire, in the thick of it, are a different thing to the stories told by fellows on the staff, who get rewards for doing nothing.<eos> And you consider me one of those, do you?<eos> I'm not talking about you!
- I suppose I am, sir.<eos> Yes, well, I'll leave you to it.<eos> Impudent puppy.<eos> Quite shy-making, all this, isn't it?<eos> But you're not shy.<eos> Indeed I am.<eos> I'm petrified of your father.<eos> He's so fierce.<eos> He has a quick temper.<eos> Does he beat you?

How was it with the old man?<eos> Hard going.<eos> But he wants the best for his daughter.<eos> And she wants me.<eos> Oh, blessed Jesus.<eos> Is it wrong to think a man so beautiful, to... long for him to touch me?<eos> Though I fear it, tell me if that is what you want for me, let me simply be the instrument of your will.<eos> Come in, come in, sit down.<eos> Something to say to you.<eos> Now, Miss, a proposal has been made to me, concerning you.

Yes or no, do you understand?<eos> All right.<eos> Off with you!<eos> Go on, off with you!<eos> Oh! Ah!<eos> Princess! It's not what you think!<eos> Ah, here she is!<eos> Come in, girl.<eos> My dear little Princess Marya,<eos> I have always loved you like my own daughter.
Come in, girl.<eos> My dear little Princess Marya,<eos> I have always loved you like my own daughter.<eos> And now, the fate of my son is in your hands.<eos> There, you see.<eos> The Prince is proposing to you, on behalf of his son.<eos> So, I ask you, do you or do you not want to be the wife of Prince Anatole Kuragin?<eos> Answer yes or no and I retain my right to express my opinion as well.<eos> So, what is it, yes or no?<eos> Father, my wish is never to leave you.
Father, my wish is never to leave you.<eos> I don't want to marry at all.<eos> What nonsense is this?<eos> Come here, girl!<eos> There, there!<eos> My dear Princess, this is a moment I shall never forget.<eos> Will you not give me a little hope of touching so great, so generous a heart?<eos> Say that, perhaps... the future is so large...<eos> Say, perhaps?<eos> Princess Marya, I do hope I haven't offended you in any way?
There, there!<eos> My dear Princess, this is a moment I shall never forget.<eos> Will you not give me a little hope of touching so great, so generous a heart?<eos> Say that, perhaps... the future is so large...<eos> Say, perhaps?<eos> Princess Marya, I do hope I haven't offended you in any way?<eos> May I not return and try again?<eos> Prince Vassily, er...<eos> I have said all that I feel in my heart.<eos> I thank you for the honour, but I shall never be your son's wife.

Hurrah!<eos> Hurrah!<eos> Fine men.<eos> Makes my heart glad to see their eager faces.<eos> I think we should have a great victory tomorrow.<eos> With respect, your Majesty, we should not engage with Napoleon at all tomorrow, or any time soon.<eos> Bonaparte has withdrawn his troops.<eos> He's asked for talks.<eos> He's desperate to avoid a battle.<eos> All my generals are in agreement except for you.

Funny how it always tastes better from another fellow's plate.<eos> - Hello!<eos> - Hello.<eos> All right, remember me?<eos> You're a fine fellow!<eos> You've all grown. I'd have hardly recognised you!<eos> Look who's come to visit us!<eos> Oh, Pierre!<eos> We haven't seen you in ages!<eos> Now I see you, I wish I'd come sooner. How are you all?
Talking of heroes, isn't Dolokhov making his home with you?<eos> Yes. Yes, he is.<eos> It was so kind of you to take him in.<eos> Well, one does what one can.<eos> Splendid fellow.<eos> It's so good to be here with you all again.<eos> What is it, Pierre?<eos> Why are you sad?<eos> It's nothing. I'm not sad.<eos> Just happy to see you.
It's so good to be here with you all again.<eos> What is it, Pierre?<eos> Why are you sad?<eos> It's nothing. I'm not sad.<eos> Just happy to see you.<eos> I thought you might have brought the Countess.<eos> Sadly, she's otherwise engaged.<eos> What a vile creature you are, Dolokhov.<eos> And don't you love it? !<eos> I hate you.
The choir will now sing a cantata in praise of our great General and souvenir copies of the music will be distributed.<eos> To the husbands of pretty women!<eos> Hear, hear!<eos> To the health of beautiful women!<eos> To the health of beautiful women, Petrushka, and their lovers!<eos> Don't you dare take what is mine!<eos> Really, Petrushka, what is the matter?<eos> Scoundrel!<eos> I challenge you!<eos> I challenge you!
What's the matter with you people?<eos> She was my soul mate.<eos> She probably killed herself just to get away from you.<eos> Can I borrow five bucks?<eos> No.<eos> - Debs?<eos> - For what?<eos> I... I want to light a candle for Bianca at the foot of the blessed.<eos> No.<eos> I hope someday you two have the precious gift of feeling what I felt for that beautiful young woman and then to have that love stolen cruelly from you by a pitiless God, and then maybe, just maybe,
Look, I got to go.<eos> I'm behind on my alignment worksheet for auto.<eos> Okay, just don't forget about our appointment after school.<eos> What?<eos> Planned Parenthood, 4:00?<eos> Right.<eos> Okay, uh, listen up.<eos> Professor Youens has been unavoidably detained, uhh, so let's review chapter 26 in anticipation for next Friday's test, okay?<eos> Um... that's, uh, differential equations, uh, applied probability, approximation theory, asymptotic and variational methods.<eos> Um... okay, most of you were lost on optimal polynomials on the last quiz, uh, so once you choose the degree and domain of the polynomial, the polynomial is chosen to minimize your worst-case error,

When I fucking say.<eos> Well, I'll stop by from time to time.<eos> Hear confession from the little creatures.<eos> You will meet Mr Patrick Jarvis, MP.<eos> He'll probably want to become a trustee.<eos> It's just his thing, to drop by in the evenings after a few drinks.<eos> We'll make it a formal arrangement as part of the... bigger deal between us.<eos> I will have an office there.<eos> My God.<eos> Some devil gets into you, doesn't it, boy?
Am I wrong?<eos> Oh, Lord.<eos> That's six, is it?<eos> Well, I will wish you a good day.<eos> The fuck are you going?<eos> Did I not make it clear?<eos> They said if they weren't here by morning prayers then the meeting has been cancelled.<eos> Perhaps Mr Jarvis has been held up at the House of Commons.<eos> Perhaps Admiral Hall's been held up at the House of Lords.<eos> Am I impressing you?

And the foreman is ours.<eos> This is someone you will meet, today, at the Ritz.<eos> I have meetings today.<eos> You have one meeting.<eos> This one.<eos> In London.<eos> So you'd best catch the milk train.<eos> Cold.<eos> My apologies, sir.<eos> And how many times I asked you to tell them about sending us the servants' crockery?
Already Mr Romanov has four outstanding bills with us.<eos> One for accommodation and three for dining.<eos> And two banquets which we wrote off.<eos> We've been asked to be understanding of our Russian friends by His Majesty, but it has been some time now.<eos> And...<eos> - May I ask your name, sir?<eos> - Shelby.<eos> Thomas Shelby.<eos> And in the future I'll be dining here quite a bit.<eos> - Then I shall put you on our special list.
Suddenly I feel incompetent.<eos> I want the portrait to hang in the office, so I want it to look formal.<eos> It's not formal.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> It's made in Paris.<eos> It was stolen in Birmingham.<eos> My mother stole it from a house she was cleaning, 1901...<eos> No, no.<eos> It's yours.<eos> It belongs on you.
They are part of an organisation called the Economic League.<eos> Did you invite them, Grace?<eos> The names sound familiar.<eos> They were recommended by the Lord Mayor.<eos> Oh. On your "best people of the city" list, eh?<eos> - Do you know them?<eos> - I'll introduce you, Tommy.<eos> No, it's all right, Danny.<eos> I'll introduce myself.<eos> We appear to have taken you by surprise.
And where does a duchess hear that?<eos> In certain circles.<eos> All right, enough, Ada.<eos> Grace, there's a lady dowager wants to speak to you about coffee mornings.<eos> She mentioned a £2,000 cash donation.<eos> Tatiana, you and I will speak later.<eos> I would like that.<eos> Going to the factory tomorrow is a mistake.<eos> Nevertheless, we will go.<eos> Also, my uncle ordered me to seduce you, to give us an advantage.
ADA: He's back.<eos> MICHAEL: Was he out there all night?<eos> Every night since the funeral.<eos> Comes back in the morning to see Charles and feed the horses, and when it gets dark, he goes off again.<eos> He used to sleep out when he was a kid.<eos> Curly would find him in the pasture.<eos> How's the baby?<eos> ADA: He asks for him mum at night.<eos> (CLICKS TONGUE) Tommy made a list.<eos> He wants to see you two first.
And Betty sends her condolences.<eos> What about the old man?<eos> We interrogated his boys.<eos> Yeah, he went to Liverpool.<eos> He's waiting for an immigrant ship to New York.<eos> When?<eos> Berthed ship sails Saturday.<eos> All right, I have contacts, people in Cunard and Liverpool.<eos> They'll have passenger lists.<eos> They can get you into the point of departure.
When she's drunk, my wife can't speak fucking English.<eos> John! - Fucking right!<eos> POLLY: You dealt with it?<eos> Incentives, no threats.<eos> Implied consequences without specific reference to physical harm.<eos> That's why young Michael is the boss.<eos> He knows better words, right, Pol?<eos> Since when was I your boss, Arthur?<eos> First, the boss meets you. Then the workers meet you.<eos> When did either of you two do a day's work?
Do you tell your friends you're painting a gangster?<eos> Is that the fun in all of this?<eos> In truth, I don't have any friends.<eos> I knew everyone through my wife.<eos> When she died...<eos> Well...<eos> Look, Polly, my motivation for doing this is twofold.<eos> Firstly, you have a face full of contradictions, and it's a challenge to capture them in one expression. -(SCOFFS)<eos> - That's the sales pitch.<eos> The second motivation is that I am planning to seduce you eventually and, please God, sleep with you.
He said he'd heard the Soviet Embassy was getting information from the inside.<eos> And? Has he got a name?<eos> Yes.<eos> But just promise me no one will get killed.<eos> Ada, it'll be me or john or Arthur who gets killed if you don't give me the fucking name.<eos> There's someone ahead of us, and I need to know why.<eos> James Monkland.<eos> He's a Lloyds underwriter.<eos> He's got an office on Curzon Street.<eos> Tommy, for fuck's sake, who is it that's ahead of you?
- Yes, I am.<eos> I am curious. What was your father's profession?<eos> Well, he told fortunes, and he stole horses.<eos> Often, he would tell a man that his horse would be stolen, and they would marvel at his powers when it was.<eos> Before we eat, should we say grace?<eos> For what we are about to receive, may the Lord make us truly thankful. - Amen.<eos> - I'm not here to eat.<eos> I'm here to do business.<eos> What I have to say can be said before the main course.<eos> Then I will leave you all to your evening.
- Piss-up actually.<eos> I brought sandwiches and lemonade I made myself.<eos> I'll make tea and empty ashtrays, but I won't handle money or slips.<eos> Arthur says what you do here is illegal but not immoral.<eos> Depends what time you get here, Linda.<eos> And, anyway, I thought I would offer you my physical and spiritual support for your time of need.<eos> Oh, Linda, if you want to be a help, run up to the shops and get me 20 Senior Service... - Lizzie'll give you the change.<eos> - No, I won't!<eos> Actually, I'll use my own money, Polly.<eos> And before you ladies decide to find me so amusing, - I have a message for you.
I think already know your weakness.<eos> I can get a fuck whenever I want, love.<eos> Yes.<eos> But I am a duchess.<eos> And I'm under you like a horse.<eos> I'm like a telegram.<eos> "A telegram"?<eos> I don't think your English is so good.<eos> Or maybe you should listen more carefully to what I have to say.<eos> I have a message for you, Mr Shelby.
He asked if you could go down and have a look yourself, Tom.<eos> - I told him wild horses wouldn't get you down. - Mm.<eos> Mr Shelby, I would just like to say that I wish I'd met your dear wife before she was taken from us and I would like to allocate an hour a day of each of my lady's time to make winter clothes for the little ones.<eos> Speak to my secretary, Miss Stark, in the grey hat.<eos> She knows my diary.<eos> Fuck me, Tom, I don't know how you do it.<eos> Incoming!<eos> - Mr Shelby?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Oh! Your little boy looks so much like you.

Your little boy looks so much like you.<eos> Yes.<eos> He's a little rascal, isn't he? !<eos> Mr Shelby, would it be too inconvenient to steal you for a moment?
We have your son.<eos> Get in the car.<eos> First...<eos> Is he safe?<eos> Of course he's safe.<eos> All children are dear to me.<eos> You have all the cards.<eos> Tell me what you want me to do and I will certainly do it.<eos> You ever drive one of these beasts?<eos> I am asking you to conduct business.
I need to speak to you about the priest.<eos> I know things about him.<eos> From when I was a...<eos> from when I was a boy.<eos> I will shoot him myself, Tommy.<eos> Just teach me how to shoot.<eos> It's easy, Michael.<eos> Just point... pull the trigger.<eos> He asked for me today, Mary... .. not his mother... .. for the first time.<eos> He missed you.
Oswald Cobblepot and two of his associates arrived, rendered Captain Barnes and Officer Vargas unconscious.<eos> Cobblepot and his associates escaped with Galavan.<eos> Are you 100% sure that he won't beat this and walk free again?<eos> You then pursued Cobblepot and his men, correct?<eos> Yes, but I was unable to locate them.<eos> You're a man of conscience, Jim.<eos> - You'll regret this.<eos> - I have many regrets.<eos> This won't be top of the list.<eos> At which point, you decided to flee the city before law enforcement could question you?
Any idea why?<eos> No idea.<eos> It was all kept very quiet.<eos> - Thanks, Lucius.<eos> - Detectives.<eos> Look!<eos> Penguin pie!<eos> There seems to be some confusion.<eos> My name... is Oswald Cobblepot.<eos> Many of you, no doubt, will have heard of me.
Get out of here.<eos> Go, go, go, go, go.<eos> I got it! I got it!<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> What is this, anyhow?<eos> - Am I being punished?<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> I make it a point to meet all new inmates.<eos> It's part of the intake protocol.<eos> Though I will ask you to refrain from making speeches atop cafeteria tables in the future.
- Oh, no.<eos> I make it a point to meet all new inmates.<eos> It's part of the intake protocol.<eos> Though I will ask you to refrain from making speeches atop cafeteria tables in the future.<eos> I'll do my best.<eos> How has your adjustment been so far?<eos> Fine, I suppose.<eos> Oh, come now, Oswald.<eos> Periods of great transition can bring on great... stress.<eos> Surely, this must be a traumatic experience for you.
Canisters gone.<eos> Looks like he got what he was after.<eos> What's he planning?<eos> "Free my wife."<eos> How was Switzerland?<eos> They have mountains, snow.<eos> People are polite.<eos> Alfred said you wanted to talk to me.<eos> Alfred wanted me to speak with you.<eos> He's worried about you.
What is it they want me to do?<eos> Be the goose.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sweet mother.<eos> Is that Penguin?<eos> - He seems drugged.<eos> - He's been quite agitated since he arrived.<eos> We put him on a mild sedative to keep him from hurting himself.<eos> Dr. Thompkins, my assistant,<eos> Ms. Peabody, will accompany you to the infirmary.
You owe me, Jim Gordon.<eos> I lied for you!<eos> He killed Galavan! Not me!<eos> It was him!<eos> It was him, Doc!<eos> It was him!<eos> I'd say that's learned him, Master Bruce.<eos> We were supposed to have a training session.<eos> Yeah, well, I got held up in the city, didn't I?<eos> Besides, I thought your chat with Dr. Thompkins would keep you occupied.
Copy that.<eos> Take cover!<eos> Nora!<eos> What the hell?<eos> Go!<eos> Hello, Victor.<eos> Forgive me for getting straight to the point.<eos> I'm a great admirer of your work and I would like to offer you a way out - of your situation.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> I'm a friend, but let me ask you:
Blast your way out?<eos> There is a set of keys on the chair.<eos> They belong to a vehicle that is waiting by the loading docks.<eos> How do I know it's not a trap?<eos> It is not a trap, it is an exchange.<eos> You get your wife and your freedom...<eos> I can keep the police at bay while you escape.<eos> As thanks, you will leave me one cartridge of your cryonic formula.<eos> What do you say?<eos> The police are coming, you can't beat them all and time is running out for you... and for Nora.
Okay.<eos> My necklace.<eos> The one that you gave me on our first anniversary.<eos> It's on the nightstand.<eos> Would you get it for me, please, dear?<eos> Go.<eos> I'm strong enough to use it if I need to.<eos> If you hurry, you can make it out before he gets back.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> This must be very stressful for you and your baby.
You have to tell them that.<eos> I will.<eos> And please tell them that I'm very sorry for my part in this.<eos> I saw the man that he was becoming and I did nothing.<eos> Because I loved him.<eos> You know what that's like, don't you?<eos> I do.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You've been very kind.<eos> God bless you and your baby.
My guess is that you absorbed some of your own formula over the past months.<eos> Your body underwent a profound cellular change.<eos> When you were brought in here, you were actually overheating.<eos> Now look there.<eos> At the thermometer.<eos> Negative 20 degrees.<eos> And I'm not even cold.<eos> Your formula appears to have lowered your core body temperature.<eos> You can only survive in severe hypothermic conditions.<eos> Anything above freezing will kill you.
You knew I couldn't do that.<eos> I can fix this.<eos> How?<eos> I mean, you did it.<eos> You killed Galavan.<eos> I'll find a way.<eos> I have to.<eos> What if you can't?<eos> Hello, Officer Pinkney.<eos> I'm so sorry to bother you at home.
You mean I move on.<eos> I've thought long and hard about this.<eos> No.<eos> You have to listen to me.<eos> I'm tired of listening.<eos> This isn't fair!<eos> How can you not be with us?<eos> Birthdays... and first steps and skinned knees... and everything.<eos> What, what, visits through bars and-and not knowing when the phone is gonna ring in the middle of the night to tell me when you're...<eos> I don't want that for either of you.
I know how to handle this type, all right?<eos> Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen!<eos> Hope we find you well.<eos> We're hoping to have a little chat with a gentleman called Cupcake.<eos> You found me, sweetheart.<eos> What's up?<eos> Mr. Cupcake, pleasure to meet you.<eos> My name's Alfred Pennyworth.<eos> Now, we're on the hunt for a guy called Matches Malone.<eos> Now, we know he snitched you up a few years ago.
I'm about respect.<eos> No fight, no deal, no Matches, no exit.<eos> All right, well, I suppose, you know, Mr. Cupcake, if you put it like that.<eos> If you wouldn't mind, sir.<eos> Will you be all right?<eos> We'll have to wait and see, won't we?<eos> Are you acting like this is my fault?<eos> It's not for me to say, is it, sir?<eos> How is it my fault?<eos> I told you to let me do the talking, did I not?
We'll have to wait and see, won't we?<eos> Are you acting like this is my fault?<eos> It's not for me to say, is it, sir?<eos> How is it my fault?<eos> I told you to let me do the talking, did I not?<eos> And did you do the talking?<eos> Yes.<eos> I think you'll find, yes, you did do the talking.<eos> To be fair, I think the result would have been similar in any case.<eos> If, Master Bruce, we are lucky enough to walk away from this alive, let this be a lesson to you.
I have to clear my name.<eos> To do that, I have to go back to Gotham.<eos> You little punks!<eos> Don't you take that bag!<eos> You have any idea who you're stealing from?<eos> Leave it!<eos> That's my money.<eos> Boo-hoo. You stole it.<eos> Now you got stole, chump.<eos> I catch you, you're dead!
I'm not coming back.<eos> I understand that, but...<eos> - Not yet. Alfred...<eos> - We need to talk. ?<eos> Good morning.<eos> Detective Gordon, should you be up?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You stitched me up.<eos> Actually, it was Master Bruce.<eos> He called from Selina Kyle's when you passed out, so I thought, bring you here.

Turns out staring into the cold, dead eyes of the man that killed your parents doesn't bring the right amount of closure.<eos> Bruce never should've been in that room.<eos> I should've gotten to Malone first.<eos> Yes, you should have done.<eos> But you didn't, did you?<eos> You can't unfry an egg, as my dear old mum used to say.<eos> So why don't we leave Master Bruce's situation alone and why don't we discuss yours.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> Right, so you were framed for the murder of that other police officer.<eos> You escaped from prison, you then tracked down the man that framed you and you were promptly shot in the leg.
Definitely more tender.<eos> - No! - ?<eos> In my opinion.<eos> No. No!<eos> You said you were innocent, and you were.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> I guess I owe you an apology.<eos> No.<eos> You were doing your duty.<eos> Can't fault you for that.
Good-bye, Barbara.<eos> Hey, Harvey.<eos> Jim will catch you up.<eos> Jim, um...<eos> Jim!<eos> Jim!<eos> You've been at it all night, Master Bruce.<eos> I think you should try and get some food down your neck.<eos> Do I smell sausage?<eos> Chipolatas to you, Mr. Fox.
She could expose us.<eos> Oh, Karen. Who's looking for you?<eos> Do they know what you've become?<eos> What I turned you into?<eos> Nope.<eos> No joy.<eos> Never mind.<eos> Still kind of nice to get out of the manor, have a little drive in the country.<eos> Ah, that's terrific, isn't it?<eos> She's made a bloody tea leaf out of you.
Jury sent me away.<eos> One day, these men show up.<eos> Tell me they're gonna fix my arm.<eos> Not only fix it, make it better.<eos> Instead, they turned me into the monster everybody thought I was.<eos> Did my father know what was going on at Pinewood Farms?<eos> No.<eos> When he found out what was going on, when he saw what they were doing to us, he shut it down.<eos> Paid to put us into hiding.<eos> So how many were there of you?
Whoever was running Pinewood, whoever started it up again,<eos> I know that's who killed my parents.<eos> Do you remember any names?<eos> None of them ever used their names around us.<eos> But the man who was in charge...<eos> I can still see his face.<eos> Every time I close my eyes.<eos> Then you need to take us there.<eos> You need to take us to Pinewood Farms.<eos> My father risked his life to save you.

She showed up a couple of hours ago.<eos> Poor thing.<eos> What is she doing here?<eos> She's come home.<eos> Huh.<eos> My father risked his life to protect her.<eos> He cared for her.<eos> And now she's dead.<eos> Because of me.<eos> Not because of you, Master Bruce.
Excuse me.<eos> Is this your office?<eos> Yes, but, Detective, please...<eos> What the...?<eos> Shredded?<eos> Son of a...<eos> Spring cleaning.<eos> You're free to look around.<eos> I'm just not sure there's much more to see.<eos> You think shredding a few documents is gonna save you?
I ain't no captain.<eos> Say something to them.<eos> I don't work here anymore, you do.<eos> All right, everyone, listen up.<eos> I know we're all a bit freaked out right now.<eos> It's understandable, hmm?<eos> Some nutjob in a Halloween costume and cape comes into our house and takes out four of our brothers? !<eos> He does this to our captain? !<eos> Now, I've been around a long time.<eos> It's like the bad guys in this town just keep getting weirder and weirder, but under that mask... is just a man, and he can bleed, just like you and me, and if he bleeds, he can be beaten.
There's a madman loose on the streets.<eos> Now is not the time to go running around on your own, is it?<eos> I don't plan on being on my own.<eos> With all due respect, sir, what good will a 15-year-old little girl do even if Galavan does turn up?<eos> Strange lied to the police.<eos> I know it, a-and so do you.<eos> I can't stay at home and do nothing.<eos> We need to trust Jim Gordon.<eos> I'm tired of trusting Jim Gordon, aren't you?<eos> I am your guardian, Master Bruce, and it is my job to protect you.
An ancient assassin?<eos> A legend.<eos> My family used to tell stories of him.<eos> He was real?<eos> Who knows.<eos> It was 300 years ago.<eos> Probably, yes.<eos> So, your brother's gone nuts?<eos> You tell me.<eos> Theo convince you that he was Azrael last night, or was he acting?
You stay there in case he comes back.<eos> Where was the last place you saw him in the city?<eos> Uh, Collins and Delaney.<eos> Last I saw of him, he was headed for the roof to see that Selina, I reckon.<eos> All right, I'll head over there.<eos> Till then, be safe.<eos> Righto.<eos> Will do.<eos> Oh, for Pete's sake, Master Bruce.<eos> Creeping up on someone like that, I could have filleted you.
When I kill you, I eradicate the Wayne name... forever.<eos> It will be as though you had never existed.<eos> Enough fun and games.<eos> Prepare to die.<eos> Unexpected.<eos> You okay?<eos> Sorry I couldn't get here sooner.<eos> Seems like I missed all the fun.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I slowed him down for you, didn't I?
Now... let's try Subject 13, shall we?<eos> How could you do this, Master Bruce?<eos> I strictly forbid you from involving that little girl, didn't I?<eos> I know... but Selina's always handled herself.<eos> I-I was sure.<eos> But you were wrong, weren't you?<eos> It's different if you choose to be involved in something like this, but you actively involved Selina Kyle.<eos> You put your own concerns in front of that girl's safety.<eos> You're way out of order!<eos> I'm... I'm really disappointed in you, Master Bruce.
And he won't see me and Lucius as a threat.<eos> No.<eos> Absolutely bloody not.<eos> You're not going to walk straight into a lion's den.<eos> I can't even go to back you up with a leg like this, can I?<eos> Alfred, you said yourself, that it's my fault what happened to Selina Kyle.<eos> That means it's my responsibility to make it right.<eos> And I may not be the man you'd choose as second in a street fight, but anything I can do to protect Bruce, I will.<eos> Still, it's half a plan, isn't it?<eos> I mean, just say that Lucius can get you in there, and you find the entrance to the laboratory, then what?

I mean, Strange won't let you within a bloody mile of the place.<eos> If I can get you inside the gate, can you manage the rest of the way?
Able to regenerate brain cells, secrete toxins from its skin, and its DNA meshes so well with human.<eos> I can't wait to see it in action.<eos> Oh, I want to increase voltage to her cortex... 200%.<eos> Are you certain, sir?<eos> It'll be like she's being struck by a bolt of lightning.<eos> Well, how much more damage could we possibly do?<eos> She's dead.<eos> I'll see you when you wake, my dear.<eos> I'm so pleased you two are getting along.<eos> I should warn you, Mr. Nygma, Mr. Stirk has been known to eat people.
You are insane, Mr. Nygma.<eos> Obviously.<eos> Jim Gordon is coming, and you're going to need all the help that you can get, so why don't you go tell Strange that if he wants to stop Gordon and the GCPD then he's going to need my help.<eos> Now!<eos> We have a heartbeat.<eos> She's awake.<eos> She's awake.<eos> Quickly, go get Professor Strange.<eos> Mr. Fox is pulling up out front.<eos> I told Gordon if I don't hear from you within an hour, I'm going to go straight to Bullock.

- Don't be such a donker.<eos> Course I can.<eos> But I won't.<eos> You see, for the past two years, Master Bruce, all I've tried to do is protect you and keep you safe.<eos> Thinking that's what your father wanted.<eos> But you're not the same boy he left behind, are you?<eos> So I have to ask myself... what would Thomas Wayne do, if he were here?<eos> Your father took responsibility for his actions.<eos> He fought very hard for what he believed in.<eos> And I will not stop you from doing the same thing.

The most important thing is that she knows who she is.<eos> Our masters will be pleased.<eos> We've created the first true reanimant.<eos> Have you made a decision about Mr. Nygma's offer?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Let's let him have a go, shall we?<eos> He was clever enough to find his way to the basement, and he does have a point.<eos> He knows Jim Gordon.<eos> I'll tell him.<eos> Bruce Wayne is at the front gate asking for you, and he has someone from Wayne Enterprises with him.
Turtleneck.<eos> As I was saying... we need to know what you know, and you're going to tell me, or poison gas will spew from the nozzles above your head and you will both die very... very painfully.<eos> I know this voice.<eos> He worked for the GCPD.<eos> He had a funny kind of name.<eos> There's nothing funny about my name.<eos> He was the one that framed Jim Gordon.<eos> You always were a smart cookie, Foxy.<eos> You know why Strange gave me this job?<eos> It's because he knows that I would kill you both and not bat an eye.
Yes, madam.<eos> The destruction of Indian Hill may proceed as scheduled.<eos> Releasing Galavan was a grave error on your part.<eos> No more of your patients will see the light of day under any circumstances, at any cost.<eos> I understand, madam.<eos> These people to whom Strange is connected, they must be pretty heavy, huh, to make you back off.<eos> Oh, they're heavy.<eos> I don't want anything dangerous. I just like being titillated.<eos> - Seriously, you don't wanna know.<eos> - Remember the time you called me from the hospital when you had Falcone on the gurney, and the whole town and their uncle were looking to kill you both?
Yes, truly marvelous.<eos> - Always was.<eos> - Indeed.<eos> Would love to chat about me, but we have a bus to catch.<eos> Ah, no, Miss Mooney, if you and the others on that bus were to appear in public, it would cause a revolution, an apocalypse.<eos> I simply can't allow you to just walk out of here.<eos> - Watch me.<eos> - Oh, please, don't go.<eos> Please, you're breaking my heart.<eos> I love you like my own daughter.

Now let's talk about the 200 cloned credit cards in your bag.<eos> I'm not saying anything.<eos> Look, punk, there are two ways we can do this... the easy way or the hard way.<eos> Tell him what the hard way is, boss.<eos> Well, first, Steven, we're gonna fill out form 38E-J1, stating noncompliance.<eos> We send it to the DA, but do they process it right away?<eos> No, because they're overwhelmed because Debra's on maternity leave.<eos> So your court date won't be set for six or eight weeks, and even then, you're gonna have to block off the whole day, because they don't give you a specific time.<eos> No, no, it's a window.<eos> Sir... Can I talk to you for a second?
We can't help you out until we know that you actually have the samples.<eos> We need proof of life.<eos> I'd be happy to dump one of the containers out of the window.<eos> No, no, no, don't do that, please!<eos> Don't dumb my sperm on us!<eos> Hello, ma'am.<eos> Top of the morning to you.<eos> All right, look, if you let us upstairs...<eos> We'll give you Abigail.<eos> I'll buzz you in.
A soda only costs 75¢, you fool.<eos> See you later, sucker!<eos> Didn't even give him the dollar.<eos> I know it seems like I blew it, but you got to give me another crack at him.<eos> Now that I'm aware of our fascinating past, I have all the ammo that I need.<eos> Perhaps you would've had that ammo if you had read the file Diaz offered you.<eos> No doubt. No doubt.<eos> Gina culpa.<eos> Okay, you get one more chance.<eos> I will not let you down.
Now all's you got to do is beat those wings and fly.<eos> - So for the next two weeks, Captain Holt will be on medical leave, which means I am the acting captain.<eos> - And we are your royal subjects.<eos> Do continue.<eos> - I want this precinct to get our normal work done, but also, we're gonna clean out the evidence room, step up community service, and complete these 22 additional tasks.<eos> Every time we check one off the list, you're gonna hear this bell.<eos> It's the sound of victory.<eos> - Hmm, you should add "fix bell" to that list.<eos> - Morning, Captain.<eos> - Peralta. - I'd like to introduce you to someone.
- What?<eos> He's just "Beautiful Mind"-ing it.<eos> Because he's a genius.<eos> - He's writing the word "case" over and over again.<eos> Oh, now he's spelling it with a K.<eos> - Is that not how you spell it?<eos> Again, I have a mouth, neck, and testicle-melting fever.<eos> - Jake. - Hmm?<eos> - Enough is enough.<eos> You need to drop this stupid backburner cold case before you both die or I will kill you.
- You! [both screaming]<eos> - Double poke!<eos> - Okay, hope you guys are hungry.<eos> Made baked ziti.<eos> Thought it would be fun to use Garibaldi's ultra authentic recipe.<eos> - Oh, great, pity food.<eos> Thank you anyway, but I can cook for myself.<eos> - Wow, I would roll my eyes so hard right now if it didn't make my brain burn.<eos> - Okay, Captain, this ends now.<eos> I know your pride is hurt, but no one ever took pity on you.
We got songs about smushing, songs for smushing to, songs for the kids.<eos> This is the all-ages piano lounge.<eos> I can't believe he's here.<eos> I've been hunting him for years, and now fate has dropped him right into my lap.<eos> He's gonna be so surprised when he sees me.<eos> Hey, Peralta, you made it.<eos> What took you so long, brother?<eos> Okay, seems like he's playing it pretty cool.<eos> Probably more surprised on the inside.<eos> Sir, Gina and I are worried about you.
I need this to settle my nerves.<eos> Hurricane Debbie is approaching.<eos> My little sister Debbie, she's a real drama queen.<eos> The drama queen of the Holt family?<eos> What, did she laugh out loud one time?<eos> She's laughed out loud multiple times.<eos> Sir, you have a pretty low bar for what you consider drama.<eos> Once, I used an exclamation point in a email.<eos> You called me Diana Ross.<eos> I assure you, in this case, I do not exaggerate.
Clear a path!<eos> I'm about to whip my biscuit!<eos> About time you smiled, Jake.<eos> You've been a real tang in the mud.<eos> - All right. - Hey, little advice.<eos> Amy is great.<eos> You want to keep her, be more receptive to her interests.<eos> All right, now you're taking it too far, Judy.<eos> I don't need relationship advice from my criminal archnemesis.<eos> Look, I just want to see you two happy.
I will hunt you to the ends of the Earth!<eos> I love you too!<eos> I'm so proud of us for being able to say it.<eos> What are you still standing there for?<eos> - Go smush!<eos> - Judy!<eos> No!<eos> Well, okay, but my train is in 45 minutes.<eos> I don't have to say good-bye to Ray. I don't want to stress him out.<eos> No, he specifically asked us to get you.
Notice I'm not sharing a desk with Flynt's assistant.<eos> 'Cause he over... there.<eos> No eye contact.<eos> Get back to work.<eos> Ugh! Listen.<eos> You just say the word, and I will barge in there and kick that dude out.<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> He is my superior officer.<eos> But more to the point, he's a welcome guest, and I am a good host.<eos> He locked you out of your own office, didn't he?
Half hour ago... they ate, and then they took off in a hurry.<eos> Half an hour.<eos> They could be anywhere by now.<eos> Nope, there's Scully.<eos> Where's Hitchcock?<eos> I'm taking you guys off your drug case.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> Jake said you didn't believe in us.<eos> What?<eos> He didn't believe in you either.
Let me introduce myself.<eos> My name is Alamo.<eos> This here's Tex, and this is...<eos> Fred.<eos> Just Fred.<eos> And we are... the Dallas Buyers Club.<eos> Okay.<eos> We make a deal.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> No, I just told them to surround you.
I mean, a week at Captain Holt's house?<eos> Wasn't that where you wanted to spend your honeymoon?<eos> Yeah, but this is too much pressure!<eos> Why did you volunteer us for this?<eos> Because Holt hasn't seen Kevin in, like, months, and I was just thinking if that was me and you, it would make me really sad.<eos> Oh. That's actually super sweet.<eos> Plus, therthis big, fat binder full of instructions and rules.<eos> There's a binder?<eos> Why didn't you lead with that, you idiot?<eos> Oh! How about I just leave you two alone?
What?<eos> These silences are very hard for me to read.<eos> - What's the vibe in here?<eos> - We're freaking out, Charles!<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> Thank you all for joining me.<eos> What we have here is a fugitive situation.<eos> Our man has been on the run for 30 minutes.<eos> Also, our man is a dog.<eos> Now, I know what some of you are thinking:
Let's go, Nine-Nine!<eos> This line is interminable.<eos> At this rate, we'll be home in 54 minutes instead of the usual 46.<eos> Not if I have anything to do with it.<eos> Watch me now!<eos> No, Gina, the wrong way.<eos> No, Gina, the spikes!<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> Well, not a problem.<eos> I can get you home on two wheels.
There's no stupid ideas.<eos> What if we walk around the neighborhood in Captain Holt's clothes, wait till Cheddar picks up the smell?<eos> No, that's insane, never gonna happen.<eos> - Anyone else?<eos> - You guys go off the grid.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> Go on. I get you guys Mexican passports.<eos> Totally untraceable.<eos> We fake your death in an apartment fire.<eos> I'll need three teeth from both of you.
- I don't know.<eos> Um, excuse me, pal.<eos> Think you're at my desk.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa! Drop it!<eos> Drop the weapon!<eos> Don't be a dum-dum.<eos> Squad, meet Detective Adrian Pimento.<eos> He's been deep undercover for the last 12 years, but he's just resurfaced, and he's rejoining the Nine-Nine.<eos> That... is... awesome!<eos> Some of you just met Detective Pimento, and, of course, some of you knew him before he went undercover.
We both said hurtful things.<eos> You didn't. I was fine.<eos> Well, now you're just lying to yourself.<eos> But Holt was right.<eos> We should have taken this more seriously.<eos> Done.<eos> Fastest time today by a full two minutes.<eos> Whoo, mama!<eos> Is everything okay over here?<eos> Yes, couldn't be better, because I destroyed you both.
How did they defuse bombs better than we did?<eos> - Those were bombs?<eos> - Unbelievable.<eos> It's a low moment for us all.<eos> I think the lesson here is that we should not allow our competitiveness to interfere with the sanctity of our job.<eos> Totally agree, sir.<eos> However, there is a precision driving class next weekend.<eos> Fastest one around the track wins.<eos> It's on.<eos> I'm gonna run you both off the road into a wall.
I guess that's okay, if you want to water down your Charles Boyle with a couple of ice cubes.<eos> Count me in as long as I get eight plus-ones.<eos> Guys, focus.<eos> We need to start planning.<eos> So when's the wedding?<eos> Next summer, next fall, next winter?<eos> Next week.<eos> - Next what?<eos> - Next week?<eos> That is not enough time to plan a bridal shower, an engagement brunch, a papier-mâché sculpture of you two kissing.
I told you, we're splitting it.<eos> All right, sure, tonight got off to a weird, rocky start, but you know what else got off to a weird, rocky start?<eos> America, and we all love America now, right?<eos> Well, it's no Amsterdam.<eos> And you know who else we also love?<eos> Rosa Diaz.<eos> Some of us even love her so much that it makes us act a little crazy sometimes.<eos> You're talking about me, right?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Ah, I would kill all of you for her.
I called you here to discuss where we are with Operation 225641441636324.
Oh, dang.<eos> Tell Peralta Whealon's approaching.<eos> Here comes the douche bag.<eos> Gray suit.<eos> Act natural.<eos> Wow, look at that.<eos> What a great magazine.<eos> Sir, if you're interested, the new issue of "Clown Boobies"<eos> just came in.<eos> I can unpack the box for you.
Let's break into the FBI.<eos> I feel like I'm doing it.<eos> Let's break into the FBI.<eos> Let's break into the FBI.<eos> Okay!<eos> I think we got it.<eos> Now, let's break into the FBI!<eos> Good morning.<eos> - Hi.<eos> This is for you.
You find yourself on the wrong side of him, he likes sherbet lemons.<eos> Sledge fancies himself a bit with the ladies, but if he comes on a bit strong, try and let him down gently.<eos> And get well in with Joyce, she knows everybody and everything and she'll never see you fast.<eos> If you don't understand something, ask me, ask her, ask anybody, but if you get an answer you don't like, don't ask 20 other people, trust your instincts.<eos> In my book, there's two instincts, fight or flight.<eos> And I know which one you've got from the way you refused to leave that cellar without me 18 months since, so have faith in yourself.<eos> You've got your smart book, or your not-so-smart book, as we fondly refer to them.<eos> Good morning, you lucky people.<eos> Got a new PCSO assigned to us today.<eos> This is Ann Gallagher, some of you already know her.
I want you to go out of your way to make her feel welcome.<eos> Sit down. Pairing Ann with you today.<eos> - What about me?<eos> - I've got plans for you.<eos> I'm not really here, I just wanted to say hello.<eos> Joyce, we met before at her house.<eos> If you need anything, I'm at the front desk.<eos> What plans?<eos> Pin your lugholes back and you'll find out.<eos> I'm loving you and leaving you.
You could never be certain it had gone to the top floor with Lynn.<eos> Her brain was so addled with crap, and, and... And...<eos> I don't know, I suppose I was hoping she might pick up the phone the second time.<eos> You had no subsequent contact with her?<eos> You've already asked me that, Ma'am.<eos> No, there was no subsequent contact.<eos> OK.<eos> Look, Catherine.<eos> You used to work in HMIT, you know the procedure.<eos> You left threatening messages on her answering machine, and you found the body, so we have to eliminate you, that's all.
And I mean all of you that I get to look at this fine morning.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> Now, when we open this building one month from today.<eos> The firebrand Tower will be the tallest building in North America.<eos> And that means that we can finally move out of that dump we've all been forced to work in all these years down the block.<eos> Mr. Brand, any comment on the Paragon Tower?<eos> Oh, you mean that tin shack they're gluing together over there in Chicago?<eos> No.<eos> No comment on that.<eos> Rumor is they're beating you by 60 feet.
Jeez!<eos> Get away from me.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> - Oh, hello.<eos> - Hi.<eos> You look familiar. Have we met?<eos> Oh, I doubt it.<eos> I know you from somewhere.
Hello, someone, anyone.<eos> I'm trapped inside a cat's body.<eos> Somebody help me!<eos> You, in the horrible green jacket.<eos> So, how are you doin' in there?<eos> The nightmare continues.<eos> Mr. Brand, this is no dream.<eos> - You can hear me? - Shh.<eos> I'm a cat whisperer.<eos> And I'm the only one who can hear you.
We've only got one day in Ohio, so...<eos> - You're selling the company.<eos> - I'll call you back.<eos> You're cutting the books, you're lining up a roadshow, and you got Goldman Sachs camped out in the conference room.<eos> We're taking firebrand public.<eos> - With the CEO in a coma?<eos> - The odds that he recovers...<eos> - When he wakes up...<eos> - If.<eos> He is gonna fire every single one of you.
Wait!<eos> Thank goodness you found him.<eos> That thing is yours?<eos> That's Mr. Fuzzypants.<eos> He keeps escaping.<eos> What kind of name is Fuzzypants?<eos> Please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You little Houdini.<eos> He won't bother you anymore. I promise.
What?<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait, this is the best part.<eos> - Should we call animal control?<eos> - No.<eos> We got Tasers.<eos> Right.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> All right, kitty, just stand still.<eos> The sad thing is I'll never get to fire you.
Sorry, some nutcase.<eos> Listen, we can still take him to court.<eos> Ian...<eos> Ian?<eos> Gotta be honest.<eos> I don't know how you're gonna get out of this.<eos> I hate cats.<eos> That's what makes this so perfect.<eos> You probably want to hear that I've learned something, that I've changed...<eos> Well, I still think cats are horrible beasts that would eat you in your sleep if they ran out of food.
Like... do you think you've moved on since his dad?<eos> You know that you're not actually a therapist?<eos> [chuckles]<eos> I've had new guys, okay?<eos> No one appropriate.<eos> Appropriate?<eos> Guys you're not gonna risk anything with... men you don't even really like.<eos> Listen, you're 17, okay?<eos> Maybe you don't know what's good about these guys that I really like.<eos> I'm talking about you.
My ma coming to the show tonight.<eos> Front row. Esther?<eos> She's a fucking pistol.<eos> Last time she saw you, she started bringing over trays of that shit. "You give this to Richie.<eos> His folks both in the ground now. - Somebody got to take care of him."<eos> How come you didn't bring the motherfucking chicken?<eos> We're running the world, we can't get a bite to eat.<eos> Selling your label, not selling your label.<eos> Have a little faith, how about?<eos> Do I not take care of you?
Frankel. You took a swing at a campus cop.<eos> Believe me, you're as good as expelled.<eos> Oh, fuck 'em.<eos> I was sick of it anyway.<eos> Sure.<eos> Fuck 'em.<eos> Of course.<eos> You've got a problem, Lip.<eos> It's time to grow up and deal with it.<eos> That's kind of strange coming from you.
What about those two?<eos> - The black ones?<eos> - Yeah, they're cool.<eos> Tungsten.<eos> I give you good price.<eos> It's kind of goth.<eos> I'd feel like I was marrying Marilyn Manson.<eos> What about these two, with the little diamonds?<eos> Oh, yeah, beautiful.<eos> How much? Too expensive for you.
Got expelled.<eos> I got bored.<eos> What?<eos> It was costing a fucking fortune anyway.<eos> Does Fiona know?<eos> No, I mean, she doesn't have to know the day before her wedding.<eos> Damn it, Lip.<eos> You have got to be the dumbest fucking smart guy I know.<eos> What?<eos> It's not like any of you deadbeats graduated high school, much less college.
John 8:7.<eos> Please.<eos> Please, Frank.<eos> This is my wedding day.<eos> Please don't fuck it up.<eos> We had fun planning for the wedding, didn't we?<eos> I love you, Fiona.<eos> My little girl.<eos> I always accepted you for who you are, with all of your faults.<eos> Accepted all of you for who you are, even when you couldn't find a place in your heart to accept me for who I am.
I think he's negotiating to get you into a nunnery.<eos> If he did, would you rescue me?<eos> No.<eos> I'd say, "Thank God and good riddance."<eos> Beast!<eos> Please, Mother, it's embarrassing!<eos> If you don't ask, you don't get.<eos> Prince Vassily!<eos> Prince Vassily.<eos> You know, I've never asked you for anything.
Prince Vassily.<eos> You know, I've never asked you for anything.<eos> I've never reminded you of what my father did for you, but now, I beg you, for my boy, Boris, a word from you to the sovereign would be enough.<eos> I'll do what I can.<eos> What is it you wish for the boy, Anna Mikhailovna?<eos> Get him a commission in the Guards and recommend him to the General.<eos> You know a word from you would do it.<eos> You know, my influence is nothing like what you imagine... but I am seeing the sovereign later this evening.<eos> Oh, thank you, thank you!<eos> I know I can trust you.
It's her name day, you know.<eos> You be good girls now.<eos> Monsieur Pierre?<eos> Yes.<eos> I thought I'd...<eos> come in the back way.<eos> Monsieur Bezukhov.<eos> Oh!<eos> Pierre, my dear fellow!<eos> We've just been hearing all about you and your dear bear friend.
Cousin, why do you stand there?<eos> ! Help me!<eos> Really! This is ridiculous!<eos> Let go, the pair of you, and give it to me!<eos> Now!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> !<eos> You leave me all alone with him and now he's gone!<eos> This... is your future.<eos> I know you'll remember what I did for you this night and remember Boris, he was his godson.
The Prince has just woken from his afternoon nap, your Excellency.<eos> Of course.<eos> Regular as clockwork.<eos> You're looking older, Tikhon.<eos> Mademoiselle Bourienne!<eos> Oh, quel bonheur for the Princess!<eos> I will tell her you're here.<eos> Oh, no, please don't.<eos> Let's surprise her!<eos> Oh, Marya, it's so wonderful to see you!

I'm very happy to see you.
What strange ideas you have.<eos> I just can't get used to the idea of it, that, suddenly, I own so much.<eos> All these houses, all these estates, so much land, plantations, forests...<eos> Surely it's wrong that one man should own so much?<eos> Well, you know, Count Bezukhov, the saying is that we don't own our earthly possessions, we merely curate them for our heirs, for the generations to come.<eos> Looked at that way, it's an honour and a duty.<eos> Yes, but I'd like to share this wealth, not simply hoard it for my children.<eos> I want to change the way things are run, not that I've any experience managing anything, but I want to do something useful, something good.<eos> You have a noble heart, Count, but I'd advise you not to rush into things.<eos> It'd be my privilege to look after all those business matters for you.
Yes, yes, he's been very kind.<eos> You couldn't do better.<eos> May I ask, what has been his advice?<eos> Well, he thinks I should get married.<eos> And so you should, a man in your exalted position.<eos> The Prince is absolutely right!<eos> The trouble is, though, women don't care for me, society women, that is, I don't seem to have the knack of talking to them.<eos> Believe me, my dear Count, it is not for you to concern yourself.<eos> It is for the young ladies to make themselves pleasing to you now, rather than the other way round, as you can see for yourself.<eos> I will leave you with the Princess Helene.

You speak from the heart, of course that frightens people.<eos> Does it frighten you?<eos> Not a bit.<eos> I love it.<eos> Ah, Bolkonsky, there you are.<eos> We're in trouble.<eos> Napoleon's armies have moved so fast we're in danger of being outflanked.<eos> Prince Bagration has very nobly volunteered to lead a detachment and engage the French in battle, whilst we continue to retreat with the bulk of the army.<eos> Goodbye, General.<eos> God bless you for a great deed.
And so it goes, gentlemen.<eos> For the final time... Old Glory rises by these hands.<eos> Suffice to say, it has been an honor.<eos> It's gonna be okay, sir.<eos> I just know that Maria's gonna pull through.<eos> I'm just so sorry to leave both of you in this situation... principal-less just as the school year is picking up steam.
Move, move, move, move, move, move!<eos> Okay, that was not smart.<eos> Get to my office. Get out of the fuckin' hall.<eos> Down there, get up!<eos> Go!<eos> What are y'all watching, a cage match?<eos> Get back to class, you savages!<eos> Principal Welles' last day at school, and this is the day you all decide to throw down.<eos> It's not very respectful, if you ask me.<eos> Makes me sick just looking at all three of you.
But I have enjoyed this spirited debate.<eos> Oh. That's it?<eos> Unless you got anything else you wanna add,<eos> See ya.<eos> North Jackson High School.<eos> You know what, I think you want the hospital.<eos> What's happening, Dayshawn?<eos> What's the chatter amongst the other workers, huh?<eos> Who you all pulling for in the principal race?<eos> Oh, you know, they, uh, they pulling for you.
What's the chatter amongst the other workers, huh?<eos> Who you all pulling for in the principal race?<eos> Oh, you know, they, uh, they pulling for you.<eos> - But, um...<eos> - "But, um", what?<eos> I don't know if you well-liked enough, Mr. Gamby.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> I mean, people got to like your ass.<eos> Look... Look at Lee Russell over there. He laughing it up with them teachers.<eos> Now, how come the teachers never invite you to eat lunch?
When you guys call out sick, how do the floors get clean?<eos> You know, how... how do these children eat food?<eos> When we call in sick, the other guys just pick up the slack, man.<eos> It ain't that difficult to move these trays around.<eos> No, Dayshawn, look, what you do is very important here, okay?<eos> And when I become principal, I'm gonna make sure you finally get the respect you're due.<eos> Now, that's what I'm talkin' about.<eos> You're gonna get us a raise?<eos> No, no, it's not gonna be a raise.<eos> I... I'm just gonna make sure that, you know, people don't look down upon you like they do now.
Oh, look at you being so nice.<eos> And who's this sitting in my chair, keeping it warm for me like a gentleman?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> My, this campus is just lovely.<eos> - Isn't it though?<eos> - Mm! Now, North Jackson's not the newest school Mm-hmm.<eos> in the district, but it is to me hands down the most charming. Even more charming now that you're here, Dr. Brown.<eos> Why thank you, Mr. Russell.<eos> Flattery will get you everywhere.<eos> I see a bright future for you here, darling.
"She's not very smart, and if she's in charge, "this school will suffer in a horrible way.<eos> "Dr. Brown only cares about herself.<eos> "She really thinks she's something."<eos> Now, who would write such a thing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm not sure. Does it say who wrote it?<eos> Why, yes, it does.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I'll admit it.<eos> I wrote the complaint against you.
No, it's not.<eos> Since you get here so early in the morning, do you mind picking up biscuits for the faculty and staff?<eos> I just think it would be a nice gesture to have a warm breakfast waiting for them when they come in.<eos> Does that sound good to you, Mr. Gamby?<eos> I mean, yeah, it sounds good. Sounds great.<eos> Biscuits are a delicious thing to have in the morning, but I don't understand why I'm the one who has to go get biscuits for everybody.<eos> Well, if you know they're delicious, then you do understand why you need to pick them up.<eos> What are you writing down?<eos> Don't worry about him.<eos> So, can I count on you, Mr. Gamby?
You know my house burned down.<eos> The whole goddamn thing.<eos> My sons didn't even wanna move here.<eos> Now look. Everything they ever owned, gone.<eos> - I can only imagine...<eos> - Do not interrupt me, Mr. Russell.<eos> - Let me finish.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> Now, I brought Blythe Sason here to observe this school, and I was expecting him to find unpleasant revelations.<eos> But after reading the report on the two of you, I was shocked.
But after reading the report on the two of you, I was shocked.<eos> "Mr. Gamby is no nonsense.<eos> "Whether you agree with him or not, "he tells it like it is.<eos> "He's a man of his word.<eos> He can be trusted."<eos> "Mr. Russell is a great leader "and a great relationship builder.<eos> He is roundly admired by the faculty."<eos> After completing his analysis, Mr. Sason concludes that you two are excellent vice principals.<eos> With everything I'm going through, it's a comfort to know I can trust the men standing beside me.<eos> And I want to thank you for being a bright spot on a rather bleak day.
- ♪ I read this all before ♪ - Hello?<eos> - ♪ And I love it ♪ - What the fuck, Bevers?<eos> - ♪ I love it and baby ♪ - I'm sorry.<eos> ♪ Four and three and two and one-one ♪<eos> Abbo, party of two.<eos> Abbo.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Do you mean "Abbi?"<eos> Your table's almost ready.<eos> But we can't seat you unless you're all together.
- Ugh...<eos> I bet when she get up here, she smells like fucked buttholes.<eos> I believe that's what the children call truffle butter.<eos> - Hey, Dr. Brown.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Boom, boom, boom.<eos> The ground fucking shakes.<eos> Boom, boom, boom.<eos> Hey, darling.<eos> Oh, we've been thinking about you.
So, what's up with you?<eos> Anything cool happening in English this week?<eos> Um, actually, no.<eos> I'm chaperoning Bill Hayden's history field trip to Charles Towne Landing.<eos> That seems a little odd.<eos> - Does it?<eos> An English teacher chaperoning a history field trip.<eos> English, history, kind of go hand-in-hand.<eos> They really don't, they're totally different departments.<eos> Let me guess, Bill Hayden invited you? - Yep.
All right, all right, all right.<eos> Chaperones.<eos> Oh, it's just like Matthew McConaughey!<eos> McConaughey, yeah. - That's funny.<eos> - Thanks, thanks.<eos> Um, shall we hit the road, guys?<eos> Yes.<eos> Sweet.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> - Neal, after you.
- That's bullshit.<eos> You know what's bullshit, Kyle Gebhart?<eos> You came on this trip with big designs, didn't you?<eos> Thought you'd come out here and expand your sexual conquests, but instead what happened?<eos> You failed.<eos> You must feel like a fool, right? Pretty fucking pathetic.<eos> I think we've all learned our lesson here.<eos> Hayden, I say when lessons have been learned.<eos> Lessons have been learned.<eos> Now Mr. Hayden's gonna take you to your rooms, since he caused this whole entire debacle.
Okay.<eos> Janice Swift.<eos> New fish. The woman you are replacing worked here for 30 years.<eos> Many people loved her, including myself.<eos> You have very big shoes to fill.<eos> Are you ready? Sure.<eos> I think so.<eos> Don't be braggadocios. It's not attractive.<eos> Grab that ISS folder and follow me. We're on the move!<eos> Each of you will be required to wear a safety vest while you dispose of the manure.
I got assigned to be faculty advisor for the homecoming committee, but, um, I don't know.<eos> This whole thing just makes me feel very uncomfortable.<eos> Now I know you're fuckin' with me.<eos> Look at these signs.<eos> Looks like you've been working on these all night.<eos> I just found that in the shed.<eos> Well, you breathed new life into it.<eos> Keep up the enthusiasm, Ms. Snodgrass.<eos> We're sure gonna need it.<eos> I wish I had a million, ten thousands of you.
- Hey, Mr. Gamby.<eos> Hello, Taylor.<eos> Principal Cavanaugh.<eos> How are you?<eos> I'm fantastic.<eos> These are my sons Mario and Luke.<eos> Uh-huh. I see the resemblance.<eos> And this is Zachary, my in vitro child.<eos> Hmm, wonderful.<eos> I just want to thank you - for everything.
I'm fantastic.<eos> These are my sons Mario and Luke.<eos> Uh-huh. I see the resemblance.<eos> And this is Zachary, my in vitro child.<eos> Hmm, wonderful.<eos> I just want to thank you - for everything.<eos> - Why thank me?<eos> Well, I took your advice to heart.<eos> When I left Percival, I had a clear vision - of what it is I need to do.<eos> I need to fuckin' annihilate you and your candy-ass school, and tonight, I'm gonna bury you and those buttoned-up pancake titties of yours out in the end zone.
Yeah, it is a fucked up haircut.<eos> - Hey, are you all right, Mr. Gamby?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> I just think it's hilarious how many people in this school aren't fine.<eos> Let me ask you a question, man,<eos> - and be honest with me, all right?<eos> - Yeah, okay. Go for it.<eos> Are you fucking Mr. Russell?<eos> Am I what-ing Mr. Russell?<eos> I'm not here to judge you about having gay sex, man.
I didn't... Did I say something?<eos> - C-word.<eos> - I didn't say anything.<eos> - C-word.<eos> - You're... We just need to keep walking and burn some calories.<eos> Come on.<eos> There is nothing that disgusts me more than a female who cheats.<eos> It can be on a husband or on a math test.<eos> It's all equally disgusting to me.<eos> I want each of you to tell me where you think you're gonna be in five years and how cheating on this math test is gonna help you get there.
I had planning seventh period, and then this six weeks, it got shifted to second period, which is just...<eos> So, I was just wondering, can I get it back to seventh?<eos> - Cinchy.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Yeah, you came to the right place.<eos> - That's awesome!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You want seventh period planning? You got it. Great.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I'll put you on the list. You'll have it next term.
There's no wiggle room in there?<eos> No wiggly room.<eos> Anything else?<eos> No, no.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Are you sure you're okay?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> - You look like you're about to throw up.<eos> - Mm-mm.<eos> I'm still trying to picture you fat, and I just can't picture it.
I feel like I look pretty cool.<eos> No, you do not.<eos> Once you feel comfortable, it'll all come naturally, so just practice a bunch.<eos> Practice a bunch.<eos> - That's what you got for me?<eos> - Mm-hmm. I...<eos> I don't have time to practice a bunch.<eos> My daughter's motocross is in two days.<eos> Uh, well, you better get lapping. And good luck.<eos> I'm excited for you.
Yes.<eos> Knock, knock.<eos> Ms. LeBlanc, we got off on the wrong foot.<eos> May I get a redo?<eos> Dr. Brown, I understand what's going on here.<eos> You have lost hundreds of books through mismanagement, and you need a scapegoat.<eos> You are a two-bit, flavor-of-the-month principal.<eos> I teach children.<eos> Without me, there is no education.<eos> Without you, who cares?
You got this!<eos> I don't think it's gonna work, but I'll try.<eos> Come on.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> Yes, Neal!<eos> Twelve o'clock!<eos> Holy shit! I did it!<eos> I fucking did it!<eos> Oh, fuck!<eos> Well, I can't thank you enough.
This truly is therapy.<eos> Now I'm happy, honestly.<eos> Thanks to them.<eos> I wouldn't be otherwise. No drug was able to save me.<eos> They're all waiting for me here.<eos> Their feeding time is near.<eos> I believe I got healthy again by taking care of them.<eos> Before, I couldn't talk or laugh.<eos> But now... let's just say, they make you fall in love again.<eos> Just as you notice the cat, the cat notices you.
See how he comes to me, isn't it amazing?<eos> I thank God.<eos> Isn't that right, Bombis?<eos> My love!<eos> Right, Bombis?<eos> God says, "I test people."<eos> God brings us closer to him in different ways.<eos> For me, it was these animals.<eos> I guess I was worthy of his love.<eos> A cat meowing at your feet, looking up at you is life smiling at you.
We don't burn them.<eos> We don't have an incinerator.<eos> - We don't even have Wi-Fi.<eos> - Then how do you kill 'em?<eos> - We don't kill them.<eos> Well...<eos> - Yes, you do kill them!<eos> Yes, uh, once in a while...<eos> Sometime... Look, we're just a charity, all right?<eos> And we only exist because people like you lose their pets all the time.
All the great philanthropists of our time are businessmen.<eos> They're entrepreneurs, innovators.<eos> My save haven project for refugees, which we began in '98, is the true expression of my belief in a commitment to the wider world.<eos> Because my good fortune means nothing unless it also lifts up my fellow man.<eos> I thank you all for your time.
- I've seen worse.<eos> - OK, you are crazy.<eos> I can assure you, madam, we're doing everything we can.<eos> The British government has chartered a plane... Hey! - ...which will arrive in three days' time.<eos> - Hello. Hello!<eos> One moment, please.<eos> Excuse me, ma'am, - I'm just dealing with this lady.<eos> - You have to get us out now.<eos> Do you hear?<eos> Madam, I can assure you, the hotel is absolutely the safest place for you to be at the moment, trust me...
I know that you're staying in the Hatshepsut suite.<eos> And do you know who is footing my bill?<eos> Freddie Hamid is everything the protestors hate.<eos> Incredibly wealthy, corrupt to the core.<eos> The Hamid family owns half the city and... Freddie Hamid owns me.<eos> Before this all started, I saw you sailing at the Cairo Yacht Club.<eos> Did you?<eos> Well, that's only when I'm invited.<eos> Which isn't often, to be honest.<eos> Who invites you?
You tell me, Mr Pine.<eos> I've left your dog with the concierge, she'll be fine.<eos> Ms Alekan, I'm so sorry.<eos> I had no idea this would happen.<eos> Don't apologise.<eos> You were right to do what you did.<eos> If I'd been brave enough, I would have done it myself.<eos> But Freddie has a temper, as you can see. And he may come back.<eos> Well, don't worry.<eos> We'll take care of you.
Thank you.<eos> - Very nicely done, may I say?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> That was very elegant.<eos> It is so pleasing to wake up the fucking Germans.<eos> Welcome to Zermatt, sir.<eos> I'm Dicky Roper.<eos> My chaps have booked some rooms here.<eos> Quite a lot of them, actually.<eos> How very good to see you, Mr Roper.
I'm the night manager.<eos> I do hope your journey wasn't too ghastly.<eos> So, where's old Meister?<eos> Tucked up in bed, is he, with an Ovaltine?<eos> Or German porn?<eos> How you getting on with those magazines, Jed, darling?<eos> Just fine, darling.<eos> Herr Meister is unavoidably tied up tonight, I'm afraid.<eos> He asked me to show you the rooms.<eos> But he does enormously look forward to seeing you in the morning when you're rested from the journey.
Can I help you, madam?<eos> Do you really stay awake all night?<eos> Yes, madam it's my job.<eos> Is the pool open?<eos> Give me one moment, please.<eos> Can I help you, gentlemen?<eos> Is the bar still open?<eos> - Yes, of course, sir.<eos> - Perfect.<eos> Allow me to escort you.
Aside from the money wasted, and the embarrassment to our American friends, the debacle at the Turkish-Syrian border has put us back five years in terms of intelligence sourcing with Syria and the Middle East.<eos> I'm extending the meeting so we can fully explore the reasons why the operation went ahead with such poor and corrupted intelligence, and what lessons can be learnt to ensure this never happens again.<eos> What led you to believe that British arms were being exported under the counter through TradePass?
I don't know why I'm telling you this.<eos> You've already made your decision, haven't you?<eos> A long time ago.<eos> Kings of Arabia.<eos> Freddie Hamid, how are you?<eos> - Hello, sir.<eos> - Good to see you.<eos> May I introduce Andrew Birch, our director.<eos> Pleasure to meet you, Freddie.<eos> Dickie's told me lots about you.
Welcome to Cairo.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - It's going to be fun.<eos> Oh, I can't wait.<eos> Well.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Mr Kouyami.<eos> East is East and West is West.<eos> And never the twain shall meet.<eos> Good to see you, Mr Roper.
- Thank you.<eos> - It's going to be fun.<eos> Oh, I can't wait.<eos> Well.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Mr Kouyami.<eos> East is East and West is West.<eos> And never the twain shall meet.<eos> Good to see you, Mr Roper.<eos> After you.
- Yes, sir.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Where is Mr Hamid?<eos> I'm afraid Freddie was a little bit of a bad boy last night.<eos> I think he might be paying the price this morning.<eos> We can make a start without him if you are content.<eos> I suggest we process the second half of the payment.<eos> I am entirely content.<eos> Good.<eos> Mr Barghati, after you.
You're probably right.<eos> Government lawyers, useless, aren't they?<eos> I was one once.<eos> Right.<eos> So...<eos> Mr Roper.<eos> The same.<eos> Not a painting.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> These gentlemen are here to place you under arrest.
A son always recognises his mother.<eos> And if he doesn't, I'll tell him.<eos> Okay?<eos> You can come visit soon, though.<eos> I promise.<eos> Be good.<eos> You're a funny fish, Jonathan.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Good.<eos> Is there anything I can do for you, sir?
- You going to come with me, Dans?<eos> - OK.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Are we taking the boats?<eos> Yes, we are, sir.<eos> You might even drive if you're lucky.<eos> Yes, you lot. Follow me.<eos> Whee!<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Nice to see you!
Don't get many visitors here, do you?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, T.E. Lawrence... of Arabia.<eos> The lonely genius who wished only to be a number.<eos> Would you put that back, please?<eos> Whose initials are these?<eos> They're my father's.<eos> It's private.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> I didn't realise it meant that much to you.
Tom Quince, it's Charlie's father's name.<eos> Nah, he's never had a passport in his life.<eos> He's probably somewhere round Bude, smoking a ton of pot and trying to sleep with the weekend talent.<eos> _<eos> It's a great pleasure to introduce the Chief Officer at the US Directorate of Defence Trade Controls,<eos> Joel Steadman.<eos> Firstly, gentlemen...<eos> - and lady...<eos> - Sorry.<eos> ...I want to thank you all for inviting me to London to share a little of what I know about the global arms trade in the 21st century and how to confront it.
Listen.<eos> Is there anyone you want us to call?<eos> A loved one?<eos> When you were sleeping, you mentioned someone called Sophie.<eos> Should we call her?<eos> Just raise your finger if you can't speak.<eos> Roper is away on business, but he'll be back soon and he can't wait to see you.<eos> Where... am... I?<eos> Are you awake?<eos> My father says I'm to thank you for saving my life.
What about austerity, Apo?<eos> This is austerity.<eos> You should have seen our country five years ago.<eos> Tomorrow's business...<eos> By the way, my Arab friend is concerned you can't deliver the merchandise you promised.<eos> I wouldn't worry about that, Apo, it'll be fine.<eos> I hope so.<eos> - Ah, Mr Barghati.<eos> - Sandy.<eos> How good to see you.
You can understand how I feel.<eos> I can, Juan.<eos> When you called the Madrid office, you had blood on your hands.<eos> And I'm here to wash it off.<eos> How?<eos> - You know Richard Roper?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - He's a friend.<eos> - Juan, he's not a friend.<eos> He dragged you down and he dragged your daughter down too.
Sandy, sort of acceptable.<eos> There you go.<eos> Apo, my dear old friend.<eos> - I'm so terribly sorry for your loss.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> How are you?<eos> I can't even imagine.<eos> Mr Barghati, thank you so much for coming.<eos> Please come inside.<eos> Let's see if we can feed and sustain you before we get down to business.
- I'm not in the mood.<eos> I like you, Thomas - you see everything and say nothing.<eos> My husband is screwing our nanny.<eos> What a cliche.<eos> Jed said I should have hired an uglier girl but the agency only had stunners.<eos> Could you do my back?<eos> Don't worry, I don't want to sleep with you.<eos> - Why is he keeping you here?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Grooming you, is he?
I had a little headache.<eos> My gallant found me a Nurofen, though.<eos> - Did he really? - Mmm.<eos> Well, that is very decent of him.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No...<eos> I am for my bed, and you are for my bed, too.<eos> Just in case you'd forgotten, you and I are not going to see each other for quite a while.<eos> See you in the morning, Andrew.<eos> I won't wake to see you off, so best of luck.
Yes, Geoffrey, it's Pamela.<eos> _<eos> Dicky, remind me of the name of that bellydancer.<eos> - Never knew it.<eos> - Bedia?<eos> No.<eos> Andrew Birch.<eos> I have three suites and two rooms booked in my name.<eos> Of course, sir.<eos> Ahem! Thank you.
Yeah, it's all good.<eos> Right...<eos> I think it's signing time.<eos> Yes, good evening, this is Sandy Langbourne, Trade Pass, for authorisation.<eos> I'm handing the phone to Mr Andrew Birch.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Please put Jan on the line.<eos> The purchase has been authorised, it's all gone through.<eos> It's all yours, my friends.<eos> And this is for you, Mr Birch.
Why would I do that?<eos> We're pulling you out because you've blown it.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> His girlfriend calls you from Roper's house phone in the middle of the night, - and you think you're safe?<eos> - If I leave now, you have nothing.<eos> I will have you not screwing up my operation, that's what I'll have.<eos> Without me, you don't have an operation.<eos> The arms were taken off a boat called the Leila Jane in Istanbul Harbour late last night.<eos> They're now being taken by road to a place called the Haven.<eos> If I stay on the inside, I can take you directly to the arms, and deliver you Roper and whoever's buying them, caught in the act.
There we go.<eos> Oh, my goodness!<eos> See if we can get a picture.<eos> Let's smile at the camera, shall we?<eos> Excellent.<eos> Can you carry a box all on your own?<eos> You stay there.<eos> You see if you can carry this all on your own.<eos> There you go.<eos> All right, very nice to see you.
- Her job is to preserve the status quo.<eos> Whatever it takes.<eos> When a continent enters into chaos, that's when opportunities open up.<eos> The British knew it in China, the Yanks in South America.<eos> I'm doing the same here.<eos> We can train armies to fight in deserts, mountains, we can teach them anti-guerrilla tactics, how to deal with political insurgency.<eos> And for a small surcharge, we can even send in teams of our own to deal with specific targets.<eos> Assassinations, fake terror plots, even the odd coup. Can't we, Jasper? Yes, sir.<eos> Jasper looks like a teddy bear, but don't let him near your neck on a bad day.<eos> - Good to see you, sir.
This is a kingdom.<eos> Look sharp!<eos> Mr Roper on deck!<eos> - Morning, sir.<eos> - Morning.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> You fellows been busy while I've been gone?<eos> All ready for you, Chief.
We are going to the camp.<eos> I am going to show her to the man who did this.<eos> Don't.<eos> For your son's sake, turn around.<eos> Go back the way you came.<eos> Airport?<eos> It's a longer journey, I'm afraid.<eos> Wait here for one minute, then drive directly to Istanbul.<eos> The Bosphorus Grand Hotel.<eos> There'll be a woman waiting for you, Room 314.
I think it's vintage.<eos> Andrew!<eos> Get your stuff together.<eos> Time to go.<eos> So have you worked out how the trick was done?<eos> The arms were never here.<eos> Just enough for the fireworks display, a little amuse-bouche.<eos> - But the main course...<eos> - Never left Istanbul.<eos> You knew British enforcement were on to you, so you changed the method of delivery.
I followed the wallet girl.<eos> What?<eos> I followed Marie.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> This is your lovely house.<eos> There's some local produce to welcome you here.<eos> You should have everything you need.<eos> Tonight's dinner and tomorrow's breakfast.<eos> I'm not seeing Cosmo?<eos> No one told you?
Sorry, there's no ice.<eos> I don't mind.<eos> Are you the one who's been calling?<eos> I thought so.<eos> What was that about Simeon?<eos> - Tell me where he is.<eos> - Why? - We need to talk.<eos> - About what?<eos> It's personal.<eos> - Why would I tell you?
So that's what happened.<eos> What are you...?<eos> But...<eos> I don't understand.<eos> How...? You followed me.<eos> - You know each other?<eos> - No.<eos> - You are...<eos> - Cosmo.<eos> Didn't recognise you.
Now, a little vodka for me.<eos> - One for you too?<eos> - Yes, thanks.<eos> That's good.<eos> Go on, speak.<eos> You must have so much to say.<eos> Pretend we're not here.<eos> I'll try to explain.<eos> I went back to the bar where we met.<eos> I waited for you.
The rain's stopped.<eos> I'll go get changed.<eos> Want us to remove your makeup?<eos> No, I can do it.<eos> - Coming with me? - Yes.<eos> Hang on. The big wrap party's tonight.<eos> Did you distribute the flyers?<eos> I did it during the break.<eos> Coming?<eos> I'm counting on you.
I put it on YouTube.<eos> 5 000 views already.<eos> That's awesome!<eos> Bravo, Oscar.<eos> You managed to make a hit that's both sad and a dance tune.<eos> What's this?<eos> He's a cross between that strange singer and Rael.<eos> - Good evening, Cosmo.<eos> - So, my friend Simeon?<eos> Do I have to fetch you?
Okay.<eos> Your people have been here all day, tearing the place apart, treating Eli like he's some terrorist or something.<eos> W... what am I supposed to tell my girls?<eos> Mrs. Condon, we know this is difficult.<eos> We're just trying to understand how your husband could behave in a way so unlike the incredible man you just told me about.<eos> Was he upset lately?<eos> Problems at home?<eos> Eli never had a bad day.<eos> He was always so cheerful and optimistic, the gentlest person I knew.<eos> Is it possible he was hiding something from you?
You remember that carnival we went to, all of us together?<eos> There's something not right about that night.<eos> I think about that carnival all the time.<eos> You do?<eos> It's kind of odd.<eos> My past, the present... doesn't stick with me anymore, but that carnival is clear as day.<eos> What... what do you remember about the carnival, Emmet?<eos> I remember me and you and Pete, Sam... - celebrating. - Right.<eos> Walking around, had a few beers.<eos> And then I impressed you all with my arm.
I remember me and you and Pete, Sam... - celebrating. - Right.<eos> Walking around, had a few beers.<eos> And then I impressed you all with my arm.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The milk bottles.<eos> I knocked them over.<eos> No, I... I knocked them over.<eos> Hell, no, you didn't knock them over.<eos> You guys were cheering me on.<eos> I couldn't have done it without you.
Previously on "Damien"... There's always been some thing, like a dark cloud hanging over me. When that old woman grabbed me, it was like it was inside me now, growing.<eos> What brings you to the V.A.?
You're safe.<eos> Am I?<eos> Are you family? - Then I need to ask you to step out so we can speak privately.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'll talk to you later. Look, I don't know what that lady told you, but I... I wasn't doing anything that was...<eos> You weren't trying to commit suicide? Ms. Rutledge just explained to me that you've been treated for substance abuse.<eos> She said this whole thing was probably an accident.<eos> That's true.<eos> I know a suicide when I see one, Mr. Thorn.<eos> We're keeping you for 72-hour observation.
Now, you want to tell me what the hell's going on?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Why would someone want to put a tattoo on your head?<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> What is it?<eos> Hey.<eos> You all right?<eos> I got to talk to someone.<eos> I will...<eos> Mr. Lyons isn't expecting you.
Thank you. All that blood test proves is that there are drugs in your system.<eos> It doesn't prove who put them there.<eos> You and I know exactly who put them there.<eos> We also know who's behind all of this.<eos> We just need to start building our case.<eos> I have to be completely honest with you.<eos> It wasn't just Ann Rutledge.<eos> I played a role, too.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> After your parents died, your legal guardians just packed you off from one boarding school to another.
I'm fine.<eos> I'm so glad.<eos> When I heard what happened... what you did...<eos> I couldn't believe it.<eos> I feel like my life's been given back to me.<eos> Huh. Well, maybe it was part of the larger process.<eos> You're maturing.<eos> Finally accepting who you really are.<eos> Who is that, exactly?<eos> I'd like to hear it from you.
I'm not going to mince words.<eos> There's a void here today.<eos> We all feel it.<eos> We're all stunned and confused.<eos> In all that confusion, let's not forget about what's really important...<eos> Troy, and all that he gave.<eos> Ann? Would you like to say a few words?<eos> Um... John and I have, um, been around the block a few times.<eos> We're at that age where we're losing some of our dearest friends, people we've known all our lives.<eos> But so many of you are so young.
I'm gonna get right to the point.<eos> Mr. Thorn's down at the police station right now.<eos> We brought him in for questioning about his possible involvement in the death of Troy Hendrie.<eos> Mr. Thorn suggested that you might've known him.<eos> Yes.<eos> He worked with me at Armitage.<eos> Hmm. Ms. Rutledge, are you Mr. Thorn's attorney?<eos> Yes.<eos> He says you're not.<eos> He says he only met you a week ago, and he suggested that you might be stalking him.
Ooh. Fumika... she's tough.<eos> I heard she once knocked out an intern with a staple gun.<eos> Don't tell her I told you.<eos> I hope you're headed out to celebrate.<eos> Yeah, you know what?<eos> I am heading out to celebrate.<eos> Know any good bars around here?<eos> I've known him his entire life.<eos> Besides handling the legal affairs of the Thorn Estate, I'm also executor of his father's will.<eos> Then why would Damien claim to only have met you last week?
What the hell did she tell you?<eos> You can't let her do this.<eos> You take care.<eos> And don't let me see you again.<eos> Let's get you home.<eos> What did you say to him?<eos> That you've witnessed more than your fair share of suffering.<eos> Did you tell him the part you've played?<eos> Not exactly the most eloquent "thank you" I've ever received.<eos> Why would I say thank you?
Any word from upstairs yet?<eos> Uh, your name?<eos> Damien Thorn, for Dr. Raiman.<eos> Oh, Dr. Raiman's out of the office today.<eos> Why didn't you tell me that before?<eos> Sir, I don't have all the answers.<eos> Okay?<eos> Claudia.<eos> Mr. Thorn.<eos> It's, uh, it's good to see you.
Don't be.<eos> What an honor.<eos> Not everybody would risk their life like that.<eos> Only heroes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, right back at ya.<eos> I know what you guys went through.<eos> Pose me sexy.<eos> We'll have Damien Thorn shoot my "Playgirl" spread.<eos> What brings you to VA, huh?
Only heroes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, right back at ya.<eos> I know what you guys went through.<eos> Pose me sexy.<eos> We'll have Damien Thorn shoot my "Playgirl" spread.<eos> What brings you to VA, huh?<eos> There's a... there's a doc downstairs who... deals with PTSD.<eos> Oh, no shit?<eos> Hope that train scare didn't rattle you.
There's a... there's a doc downstairs who... deals with PTSD.<eos> Oh, no shit?<eos> Hope that train scare didn't rattle you.<eos> No, no.<eos> Um, lot of other stuff.<eos> I was in the field a long time.<eos> The minute I got back to New York, I lost a good friend.<eos> I went south from there.<eos> I feel you.<eos> How about you?
Oh, no shit?<eos> Hope that train scare didn't rattle you.<eos> No, no.<eos> Um, lot of other stuff.<eos> I was in the field a long time.<eos> The minute I got back to New York, I lost a good friend.<eos> I went south from there.<eos> I feel you.<eos> How about you?<eos> How are they treating you here?
Not much to be done.<eos> My body's shutting down.<eos> Here.<eos> You have to stay hydrated.<eos> There.<eos> Hey, uh... do you guys mind?<eos> Hey, get over here, baby.<eos> We don't have any recent pictures, huh?<eos> Shh, shh, shh. Breathe.<eos> Yeah. Why don't I stick around and photograph you and... let people see what you're dealing with?
No?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I thought you were retired?<eos> The receptionist had no record of Alice Webster.<eos> And since I see no journalists, I must presume the girl's return has been kept secret.<eos> The last thing that girl needs is any more stress.<eos> Of course.<eos> But there's only so long the flow of police into this hospital can go unremarked upon.<eos> Look, I wish nothing but peace for the girl.<eos> I asked you to look into the Giroux case file, not come out to Germany.
'Hey.' Mrs Webster, I said I'd call when I arrived.<eos> Do you really think you're going to find something out there?<eos> Well, I wouldn't have come if I didn't.<eos> 'No, I know.'<eos> Look, I want to believe you, it's just hard.<eos> Are you still doing what I asked, with the photographs?<eos> 'Yeah, when I can.'<eos> 'If my family knew what I was doing, they'd think I'd lost my mind.'<eos> But, yeah, I am. 'You have not lost your mind, Mrs Webster.'<eos> Do you ever feel like your family are just...slipping away from you?
I'm not so sure.<eos> I usually like to try and think the best of people.<eos> The trouble is... ..people continue to disappoint me.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> I'll take you to Azwai.<eos> What changed your mind?<eos> I thought about what you said, and you were right.<eos> I'm here to file stories, and you, Monsieur Baptiste, you have a...<eos> ..well, you have a habit of finding them.<eos> If I didn't follow you, I wouldn't be doing my job.
- They haven't been released.<eos> Right, so we're looking for someone who had access to BSD files and who's capable of a sadistic, ritualistic murder like that.<eos> - Oh, fuck. - Can you think of anyone?<eos> Hey, maybe you should let me do the talking.<eos> Sure.<eos> They're not home.<eos> Let's take a look around.<eos> - Mr. Proctor.<eos> - Se? or Loera.<eos> - Good to see you again.
Bring it up.<eos> Show me.<eos> Hi.<eos> As long as we all whipping our shit out...<eos> - Emilio Loera, I take it?<eos> - Who the fuck are you?<eos> I'm nobody.<eos> You know my name, so you know who I am.<eos> Which means you know what kind of a mistake it would be to try to steal from me, right?<eos> I wouldn't dream of stealing from you.
No!<eos> No, I didn't!<eos> I didn't kill her.<eos> Shit.<eos> You son of a bitch.<eos> He'll kill you for this.<eos> And will you?<eos> Find me?<eos> Promise.<eos> Everything I did I did for you.
- Shut up.<eos> - Shoot me!<eos> Please just walk away.<eos> Do it.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Give me that fucking gun.<eos> God damn it.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Maggie!<eos> There's nowhere you can go, either of you.
Where the hell did you get this?<eos> Now, you know better than to ask.<eos> Point is, you spent your retirement fund getting me out.<eos> Well, you're too old to be slinging drinks, so...<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know how to reach me?<eos> No one knows how to reach you.<eos> - He does.<eos> - Yeah, I do.<eos> This is where I leave you.
At least if I care about the characters, you know, even one of them.<eos> Well, you know, literature is a very personal taste.<eos> I wouldn't exactly call it literature, although I liked it better than your last one.<eos> This one was at least coherent.<eos> My last one was postmodern, so...<eos> Yeah, it was totally incoherent, totally.<eos> I wouldn't exactly call it incoherent, Dominic.<eos> Oh, come on, it was like the ravings of a madman, a lunatic, or let's say a guy with limited intelligence.<eos> Uh, yes, well...<eos> I saw a lot of you in that character.
Yeah, it was totally incoherent, totally.<eos> I wouldn't exactly call it incoherent, Dominic.<eos> Oh, come on, it was like the ravings of a madman, a lunatic, or let's say a guy with limited intelligence.<eos> Uh, yes, well...<eos> I saw a lot of you in that character.<eos> Yeah, can you just cut the hair?<eos> So you're writing another?<eos> Or did I read your publisher went bankrupt?<eos> Um, I'm working on an idea for a television series now.<eos> Ah, probably an easier medium for you.
I'm a very lucky guy, you know, when I think of it,<eos> I got a lovely wife. I got a great marriage.<eos> I got great grandchildren. I, you know...<eos> I just live...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm blessed.<eos> I'm blessed.<eos> Yeah, so was Job.<eos> Then one, two, three, God fucked him over.<eos> So tell me, Mr. and Mrs. Bellman, exactly what marital difficulties bring you here today?
We're going to see some great folk music downtown.<eos> - Oh, folk music, wow.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Well, you're excused!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> - It was a pleasure to meet you.<eos> - You too.<eos> - Lovely to meet you.
I think we will lose this battle, and a great many men will die.<eos> My God, Bolkonsky, what a shambles!<eos> How do you really feel about Sonya?<eos> I do love her, Tasha.<eos> I haven't been a very affectionate husband... but it's no use saying that now.<eos> Here he is!<eos> Your wife is even more beautiful than I remember, Bezukhov.<eos> To the health of beautiful women, Petrushka and their lovers.<eos> I challenge you!

Out!<eos> Get out!<eos> A thousand apologies, Your Excellency, there will be a little wait for fresh horses.<eos> It's nice and warm in the parlour, if you don't mind sharing it with another gentleman.<eos> No, no I don't suppose I have any choice, do I?<eos> Good evening.<eos> Evening.<eos> What?<eos> I believe I have the pleasure of speaking with Count Bezukhov?<eos> I have heard about the misfortune that has befallen you, sir, and I am very sorry for it.
Yes, I belong to the brotherhood of Freemasons.<eos> I'm afraid my way of thinking is very different from yours.<eos> I don't believe in God.<eos> Of course you don't.<eos> You don't believe in God because you don't know him.<eos> And that's why you're so unhappy.<eos> I am unhappy I should think anyone could see that but what am I to do about it?<eos> How can I know God, if all my powers of reasoning tell me he cannot exist?<eos> God is not apprehended by reason, my son, but by life.<eos> I don't understand you, sir.
Very little, so far.<eos> You need to purify yourself, listen to your conscience.<eos> Look at yourself.<eos> Ask yourself, are you content with yourself?<eos> With your life?<eos> No, I hate my life.<eos> I hate myself.<eos> Good.<eos> You have taken the first step.<eos> Your wound still troubles you?
I never vary!<eos> Work, exercise, a good night's sleep that's all a man needs.<eos> What next for you?<eos> Back to the army?<eos> No. I've had enough for now of dreams of glory.<eos> And Napoleon's wars seem like nothing to do with us.<eos> - I'd like to make myself useful here.<eos> - Good!<eos> Glad to hear it.<eos> Plenty here to keep you occupied.
How is your mazurka coming along, Natasha?<eos> Well, we thought we were doing very well, until Denisov told us we were doing it all wrong.<eos> - You did.<eos> - What do you know about it, Denisov?<eos> Oh, I was dancing the mazurka in Poland when you were still in petticoats, my boy!<eos> Really?<eos> The way they used to teach us in Poland...<eos> Have you always lived with the family, Sonya?<eos> Yes, since I was a little girl.<eos> Nikolai speaks so warmly of you, and now I can see why.

We've heard you boasting, now you can show us what you can do!<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - Yes!<eos> Make him, Father!<eos> No excuse, Denisov, you might as well submit.<eos> Best idea all night.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Denisov, you're a wonderful dancer!<eos> I had no idea.<eos> For you all for you.
For you all for you.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Now this, you absolutely deserve!<eos> Yes!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Shall we sit down?<eos> Countess.<eos> Natasha.<eos> If I don't speak now, I'm afraid I never will.<eos> I adore you.
Now this, you absolutely deserve!<eos> Yes!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Shall we sit down?<eos> Countess.<eos> Natasha.<eos> If I don't speak now, I'm afraid I never will.<eos> I adore you.<eos> I have never felt this way about any woman or girl.<eos> I think about you all day and dream of you at night.
I have never felt this way about any woman or girl.<eos> I think about you all day and dream of you at night.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> I know I have no hope, but I must ask you.<eos> Will you make me the happiest man on earth and consent to be my wife?<eos> I wish you hadn't said that.<eos> I beg your pardon.<eos> - I couldn't help it.<eos> - Dear Denisov.<eos> I'm so fond of you, but...
A moment of madness.<eos> All over now.<eos> Now, if you will excuse me...<eos> Now you must be blindfolded.<eos> Why is that?<eos> If you wish to join our brotherhood, you must be willing to submit to our rituals without question.<eos> Are you willing?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> I will leave you now.
He's a very good man.<eos> Not practical, I suppose, but who am I to talk of such things?<eos> I'm very fond of him.<eos> The whole family are delightful.<eos> Well, there you are.<eos> You can mix business with pleasure!<eos> Do tell your father that I shall do my very best to make my contribution to the militia.<eos> I've been very lax.<eos> Do you know, I moved the family to the country to save money, but somehow, I've been doing more entertaining here than I ever did in Moscow hunts, theatricals, dinners, musicians, endless guests coming to stay...<eos> Well, I shan't be any further burden to you...

Of course, you must stay the night.<eos> And as long as you wish!<eos> And you needn't be talking to boring old men like me,<eos> I've seen you looking at those lovely girls.<eos> Natasha!<eos> Stop that, my darling, and come over here.<eos> My daughter, Natalia.<eos> Natasha, this is Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, one of the great heroes of Austerlitz.<eos> I'm happy to make your acquaintance, sir.<eos> I think I saw you before, didn't I?
Yes.<eos> Yes, you looked at me so severely!<eos> No, not at all.<eos> Not severely.<eos> At least, I hope not.<eos> Go and take him away and talk to him, Natasha.<eos> He's had enough of me.<eos> Are you the Prince Andrei that Pierre Bezukhov talks about?<eos> He is my greatest friend.<eos> He loves you very dearly.
I understand you have made a great effort to change your life.<eos> That's very commendable.<eos> How do you feel about yourself?<eos> Well, I can look at myself without disgust now.<eos> But... still not happy.<eos> Not at all.<eos> I sleep badly, I wake with fearful thoughts.<eos> What's the matter with me?<eos> Perhaps you are changing your world, and forgetting to change yourself.<eos> Do you try to forgive those who have wounded you?
I shall be otherwise engaged, and you need to find yourself a pretty little heiress to charm out of her petticoat.<eos> - Think you can do that?<eos> - I don't want to do that.<eos> I want you.<eos> Sweet boy.<eos> I'm so nervous!<eos> I've been awake for hours, thinking about the Tsar's ball tonight.<eos> Oh, but you've got nothing to be nervous about.<eos> It is important, my darling, for you and for Sonya the first time you'll be seen in Petersburg society.<eos> Everyone's eyes will be on you.
Take a year, go abroad, take a cure, find a tutor for Nikolushka, and if, after this year, your passion for this girl is still so irresistible, marry her then.<eos> Can you do this?<eos> To please me?<eos> - Mama!<eos> - Natasha.<eos> - Mama! - It's him!<eos> - What? - It's him.<eos> What am I going to do?<eos> Prince Andrei Bolkonsky.<eos> Oh! Prince Andrei, it's a pleasure to welcome you here.
- Mama! - It's him!<eos> - What? - It's him.<eos> What am I going to do?<eos> Prince Andrei Bolkonsky.<eos> Oh! Prince Andrei, it's a pleasure to welcome you here.<eos> It seems so long since we last saw you.<eos> Countess Rostova, may I request your permission for a private conversation with your daughter?<eos> Of course, Prince.<eos> Come with me.<eos> I loved you at the moment I saw you.

- She's a dear girl and we're very fond of her... - What circumstances?<eos> You know the circumstances very well!<eos> Our family affairs are in disorder and we've been expecting you to help put them right!<eos> Your conduct so far has had the opposite effect, as you well know.<eos> Besides, Sonya is your cousin.<eos> How you could have let her wheedle her way...<eos> My feelings are my own, Mother, and I can't go back on my word.<eos> Then you'd better know that I can never recognise that intriguer as my daughter!<eos> - "Intriguer"? !<eos> How can you use such a word about a girl who's always loved you like a daughter?
Would you be so good as to wait here, sir?<eos> Well, bless my soul, this is odd.<eos> Is someone ill, I wonder?<eos> BOLKONSKY, FROM INSIDE:<eos> What? ! I don't want them in my house!<eos> - I never asked for them!<eos> You can see them if you like! - Papa!<eos> Perhaps we should go...<eos> My dear Count Rostov, I'm so sorry you have been kept waiting.<eos> The Prince is indisposed, but Princess Marya will receive you.

I don't want to see anybody.<eos> Let me stay and keep you company.<eos> I don't need company.<eos> I just need a little rest, that's all.<eos> Come and kiss me.<eos> There.<eos> Now, go.<eos> ...next time you'll have to be better...<eos> I'm not nagging, but I do think it would be nice if you tried a little harder...<eos> Just popped in to say what a pleasure it is to see you back in Moscow, Count Rostov.
That's Anatole Kuragin, the Countess's brother.<eos> Very attractive, no?<eos> Ah, here's the Countess herself.<eos> Fine woman, isn't she?<eos> She's as beautiful as everybody says.<eos> Count Rostov, you must introduce me to your lovely daughters.<eos> Of course.<eos> Here's Natasha, and this is my niece, Sonya.<eos> I'm so happy to meet you.<eos> My husband has talked of you often.

- Just one dance.<eos> I think we really should be going.<eos> My wife's not very well, you know?<eos> Oh, please don't deprive us of your lovely daughter, Count.<eos> Come and sit with me and watch the dancing for half an hour.<eos> Well...<eos> Half an hour?<eos> Very well, why not?<eos> Wonderful!<eos> I haven't been able to think of a single thing except for you.

Wonderful!<eos> I haven't been able to think of a single thing except for you.<eos> I'm in love with you.<eos> - I've been in complete torment...<eos> - Please!<eos> You mustn't say such things.<eos> - I'm engaged...<eos> I'm in love with someone else.<eos> - What is that to me?<eos> Don't you understand, I'm madly in love with you?
Dance the next.<eos> I can't!<eos> You make such a lovely couple.<eos> I'm sorry you have to go so soon.<eos> Ana...<eos> Anatole!<eos> No...<eos> - No, no, please...!<eos> - What can we do?<eos> I can't call on you openly.
I can't!<eos> You make such a lovely couple.<eos> I'm sorry you have to go so soon.<eos> Ana...<eos> Anatole!<eos> No...<eos> - No, no, please...!<eos> - What can we do?<eos> I can't call on you openly.<eos> Am I never to see you?

- I'm not your enemy.<eos> Don't you see that what you're doing is wrong?<eos> You don't understand anything!<eos> Oh, just go!<eos> Just...<eos> I hate you!<eos> If you please, miss, there's a lady to see you.<eos> Princess Marya, I wasn't expecting...<eos> I have been in despair because of the misunderstanding that happened between us.<eos> My brother loves you and I will love you, too.

I'm so unhappy. I've spoilt everything, haven't I?<eos> Don't try to talk about it now.<eos> Later, when your soul is clear, remember, I'm always your friend.<eos> If you need help, or advice, or just to pour your soul out, remember me, dear Natasha.<eos> Don't talk to me like that.<eos> I don't deserve it.<eos> I'm ruined, aren't I?<eos> No... for God's sake, no.<eos> Listen.<eos> If I were not married myself, and a better man than I am... I mean, worthy of you... I would go down on my knees this minute and ask for your hand and your love.
- How are things?<eos> - All well, Your Excellency.<eos> Ah, we have been waiting and waiting for your arrival!<eos> Do step in, Prince Andrei!<eos> Do I need your invitation?<eos> - No, of course...<eos> - Are you mistress of this house now?<eos> No, not at all...<eos> Where are my father and Princess Marya? And my son?<eos> Inside, waiting for you, Prince.
They're good people, Father.<eos> They know when they're onto a good thing, I'll say that for them!<eos> How can anyone be so gullible?<eos> I know, I know. I see you looking at me.<eos> I should treat her more kindly.<eos> But she drives me to distraction with her stupid religiosity... the way she moons about the house with her eyes full of tears.<eos> What's she got to be mournful about?<eos> La Bourienne... now, she makes the most of herself.<eos> She makes herself agreeable! Eh?<eos> If you're asking me... I wouldn't have said it, but as you ask... I think you treat Marya abominably, when anyone can see how much she loves you and respects you.
When I see Anatole Kuragin again, I shall challenge him and kill him.<eos> And then, perhaps, my mind will be at peace.<eos> I wish you would play again properly, and sing again.<eos> Sometimes I try, but it feels wrong, you know?<eos> As if I've no voice left to sing with.<eos> It will come again.<eos> You've been very ill.<eos> You know, it takes time.<eos> - What I did to Andrei...<eos> - He should have forgiven you.

I mean, look at me.<eos> My life is one mistake after another.<eos> Is that how you see it?<eos> How could I see it otherwise?<eos> I wanted to change the world for the better, help my fellow men and look at me... a fat, drunken aristocrat who makes a bungle out of everything.<eos> Natasha, I've done nothing with my life, nothing!<eos> You've been very kind to me.<eos> And that's only because I...<eos> Never mind.<eos> No-one's as kind as you.
Never mind.<eos> No-one's as kind as you.<eos> No-one understands me as well as you do.<eos> If you hadn't have been there... then, and now... I don't know what would have happened to me, because...<eos> If you knew how...<eos> No, this is wrong!<eos> What?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Natasha, I think...<eos> I think it's best if I don't visit you so often.
There are no horses, Princess.<eos> Of course there are horses!<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> It's God's punishment, Princess.<eos> Most of the horses were taken for the Army, and, as for the rest of them, there's nothing left to feed them with.<eos> Lies!<eos> What it is, Your Excellency, they've got it into their heads that they'd be better off waiting for the French.<eos> You haven't understood.<eos> You have my word that you will be housed and fed at our estate near Moscow.<eos> If you stay, the enemy will destroy you.
I'm Lieutenant Ilyin of the Pavlograd Hussars and this is Count Rostov, our squadron commander.<eos> And we will be delighted to speak with your mistress... might we know her name?<eos> She is the Princess Marya Nikolayevna<eos> Bolkonskaya, Your Excellency.<eos> Her father, the Prince, died yesterday, and the peasants have been taking advantage of the situation.<eos> I am sorry to hear of it.<eos> Please show us the way.<eos> I am ashamed to have to beg for your assistance, sir.<eos> Not at all, Princess. This is an outrage, and I am only too happy to be able to assist you.<eos> It will be both a pleasure and an honour to escort you away from here and I promise you, no-one will dare cause you any trouble.
We heard of your rescue of Princess Marya.<eos> Ah! Well, it was fortunate that I was passing.<eos> You made a great impression upon the Princess.<eos> Did you know that she's here in<eos> - Voronezh, with her aunt?<eos> - Really?<eos> Yes, she is.<eos> And, of course, you will call upon her tomorrow morning, to pay your respects.<eos> I should be very pleased to see her again.<eos> You know, it's just the match for you.
I liked her very much when I met her, and I hope to see more of her.<eos> I hope you do.<eos> Strange how things turn out sometimes, isn't it?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Ah, Prince Andrei!<eos> Welcome back, Your Grace.<eos> I'm delighted to be under<eos> - your command again.<eos> - Good lad!<eos> I'm very glad to see you.
- Is that for me?<eos> - No, actually, it's for me.<eos> You're later than usually this morning.<eos> I've been waiting for you.<eos> Donna, about the other night.<eos> I know you said you wanted more, but before you say anything... - I want to be a partner.<eos> - Partner?<eos> Yes.<eos> I figured out what I want, and I want to be a partner at this firm.<eos> Donna, I don't mean to insult you, but you're not even a lawyer.

I lost a chance at being a father.<eos> And those associates have always been my children to me.<eos> My children.<eos> And the truth is, I've been neglecting them ever since they got here, but that ends this morning.<eos> I'm proud of you, Louis.<eos> Thank you, Gretchen.<eos> - Where the hell have you been?<eos> - Neil, you called an hour ago.<eos> Well, that means you should have been here in 30 minutes.<eos> Well, I got news for you:
Thank you, Gretchen.<eos> - Where the hell have you been?<eos> - Neil, you called an hour ago.<eos> Well, that means you should have been here in 30 minutes.<eos> Well, I got news for you:<eos> I'm not Dominos.<eos> That's too bad, because slinging pizzas might be the only job you can get if you don't stop shitting the bed.<eos> Shitting the bed?<eos> How's that?<eos> I've been trying to get you on the phone for two weeks.
I got something for you to do, and I want it done yesterday.<eos> Let me guess, you want to sell your vodka business.<eos> How the hell could you know that?<eos> Because you don't clean up the balance sheet of your third largest division six months after you restructure if you're not looking to put it on the market.<eos> Okay, you brought the right guy.<eos> My question is, what took so long?<eos> And my question is what's the rush?<eos> 'Cause you also don't ram a transaction through if you don't have to.<eos> I have an opportunity to buy another company, and I don't wanna let it slip away. What company?<eos> I'll start vetting them for you.
It's a long story.<eos> I ju...<eos> I might be taking over the associates, and if I do, I just want to be prepared.<eos> Rachel, that's amazing, but are you telling me that Louis is really ready to give that up?<eos> That's the long story.<eos> But I'll tell you about it later tonight.<eos> - I can stay.<eos> - No, you should go...<eos> Great, okay.<eos> I love you.

You just might as well keep drinking, 'cause if we're not having fun, what the hell are we doing here?<eos> Yes!<eos> Copy that.<eos> Svetlana...<eos> You know this office isn't gonna pack itself up, right?<eos> It's not packed because one of us has been at work for the last three hours.<eos> The other one of us was sleeping off all the work he did last night.<eos> You mean you're hung over from all the vodka you drank?<eos> Yeah, that's what I just said.<eos> I never should have hired you back.
Speaking of boatloads of cash...<eos> It's a check for half a million dollars.<eos> I told you I was serious about becoming a partner, and I am.<eos> - Donna...<eos> - Harvey, be honest.<eos> You haven't given one thought to what we talked about yesterday.<eos> - I've been a little busy.<eos> - And you've also been avoiding the subject.<eos> This way, you have to take me seriously.<eos> I do take you seriously.
I don't need an appointment.<eos> I'm sharing things about my life.<eos> Last time I checked, that's what people do on dates.<eos> Yes, it's what they do, Harvey, but on first dates, they also try to make the other person feel special and listened to.<eos> Paula...<eos> Do you know why it's unethical for a therapist to go out with her client, Harvey?<eos> Yeah, of course I do.<eos> It's because it's natural for a client to transfer feelings of desire onto his therapist that aren't real.<eos> - I know that. - What you may not know is that it's not unnatural for a therapist to feel the same way.<eos> You don't think I've had fantasies about you?
If you need a session, call my office.<eos> Unfortunately, I can't see you anymore, but I can give you a recommendation for someone who can.<eos> - Louis, what can I do...<eos> - Do for me?<eos> You could tell me from now on if you have a problem with me, you'll take it up with me instead of going behind my back.<eos> - What?<eos> - That's right.<eos> You think I don't know the whole<eos> "Rachel should be in charge of my associates"<eos> bullshit came from you and not Donna?
Then why get rid of it?<eos> And more importantly, why'd you need the sale to go through so quickly?<eos> I told you, I have another opportunity.<eos> And what if I said the real reason was you knew you vodka business was about to be sued for using another brand's recipe?<eos> I would say I did not know that.<eos> - Well, now you do.<eos> - It doesn't change a thing.<eos> Those two dipshits already signed the agreement.<eos> Neil, this looks a hell of a lot like you're asking me to be a party to fraud.<eos> I'm asking you to do your job.
I swear I was gonna tell you.<eos> Yeah, I heard, but I guess when you move on, you move on, right?<eos> - Come on, it's not like that.<eos> - Bullshit, it's not like that.<eos> You left, Mike, after everything you said.<eos> Would you please just let me explain?<eos> I fought for your goddamn job.<eos> I know that, and I will always be grateful for it, but I am telling you, it's better this way, because...<eos> Better for who? Based on that extra cash that you had to throw at Nathan?<eos> I'd say it's better for you.
I don't care whether you agreed to it or not.<eos> You're gonna live with it.<eos> And I don't give a shit what your supposed title is.<eos> I'm not giving up my associates.<eos> And if you think you're gonna leave this bathroom without giving me the respect I deserve...<eos> I'm not giving up my associates.<eos> - That's enough.<eos> - Harvey, what the hell kind of shit did you pull?<eos> Shut up and listen, Louis.<eos> Donna asked for a seat at the table, and I gave her one, because when she worked for me, she had my back, and would kill anyone coming for me, and when she worked for you, she did the same exact thing,
And from now on, it's,<eos> "Are you serious, Ma'am?"<eos> Have you got that, pretty boy?<eos> My God.<eos> Harvey's created a monster, hasn't he?<eos> You have no idea.<eos> Donna...<eos> It's about time.<eos> Hey. I know we haven't spoken, and we didn't exactly leave things off well, but...<eos> I just really need to see you tonight if at all possible.
Or maybe it's ladies' night, after all.<eos> I think one of the smaller...<eos> All right.<eos> Biggest one it is.<eos> You got it.<eos> Oh, dear God.<eos> You got this.<eos> Okay?<eos> Remember, just hold your breath.<eos> And I love you.
All you have to do... is meet me at the train station with the microfiche.<eos> And... time.<eos> Um... anyone know where I can get a copy of that microfiche?<eos> Yes.<eos> Very good indeed.<eos> Starr?<eos> And... go.<eos> I told you already, Mr. Peterson, the answer is "no."<eos> I shouldn't even be meeting you right now.<eos> Give me the microfiche, you bitch, or I'll kill you and your family.
I'm taking five. Don't forget the beer bucket.<eos> _ Ah, Father!<eos> I noticed you standing there.<eos> Always good to see a fellow soldier for the Lord.<eos> Question for you?<eos> Hit me.<eos> Are you crazy or just a con man?<eos> And those are my only two choices?<eos> 'Cause I normally describe myself as a "left-handed alcoholic sinner child of God."<eos> I didn't mean to insult you.
You're my miracle.<eos> I'm out of town next week, but when I get back then we'll have to have a rematch.<eos> I'll check my schedule.<eos> See if you can squeeze me in.<eos> Stop!<eos> Mrs. Waterford, this is state business.<eos> She's pregnant!<eos> I just wanted to check if you were okay.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I should've just driven away with you.
Mrs. Waterford, this is state business.<eos> She's pregnant!<eos> I just wanted to check if you were okay.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I should've just driven away with you.<eos> Mrs. Waterford, I'm not pregnant.<eos> I got my period.<eos> You will stay here, and you will not leave this room.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> Things can get much worse for you.
Right on schedule.<eos> It doesn't really matter.<eos> Waterford's probably sterile.<eos> Most of those guys are.<eos> Sterile.<eos> That's a forbidden word.<eos> There's no such thing as a sterile man anymore.<eos> There's only women who are fruitful and women who are barren.<eos> I can help you.<eos> It could be the only way for you.
Where are you taking this Handmaid?<eos> Open the gate.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Blessed be the fruit.<eos> He can't be in here yet.<eos> First is household staff, then the wife, then the Commander.<eos> And he knocks.<eos> He has to knock.<eos> He can't be in here.<eos> Sorry, did I startle you?
Yes, ma'am.<eos> Blessed be the fruit.<eos> He can't be in here yet.<eos> First is household staff, then the wife, then the Commander.<eos> And he knocks.<eos> He has to knock.<eos> He can't be in here.<eos> Sorry, did I startle you?<eos> I just wanted to say hello.<eos> I haven't seen you in a while.
My God.<eos> Maybe I really am a genius.<eos> Yeah, maybe you are.<eos> Well, then it's a good thing I didn't throw this away.<eos> - What's this? - I've compiled a list of everybody who's invested in products like this in the last five years.<eos> That's great, but we're not gonna need this.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because the thing that makes the Donna special is me.<eos> Which means we need to look into investors who know me.<eos> Yes, correct, and nobody knows you better than Harvey.
Hey.<eos> What's going on?<eos> You got out of bed before it was light out.<eos> And you never came back.<eos> I want to talk to you for a minute.<eos> About what?<eos> I know you went to Harvey and you made him promise to pull the plug on my getting into the Bar if things got too risky.<eos> He wasn't supposed to tell you that.<eos> Did you really think he wouldn't?<eos> Mike, I only made him promise because I care about you.
Not gonna be a lawyer.<eos> Mike.<eos> The thing is, I was fine with it until Harvey started dangling it in front of my face.<eos> I think the problem was, I actually started believing it could happen.<eos> Do you want me to stay with you today?<eos> No.<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> Besides, you've got a lot of work to do and I've got a big case to win.<eos> Harvey, there you are.<eos> Louis needs to see you right away.

But I'm too busy to hear about another crisis with his girlfriend or drama in his canasta club or how his mouth guard doesn't fit.<eos> Couture Apparel fired us.<eos> - What?<eos> - Carly got upset that Louis brought Rachel and Katrina to the meeting instead of you.

But then he'll never get into the Bar.<eos> Why do you think I said I don't have time for anything else right now?<eos> So you're telling me that asshole's holding all the cards, and Mike's never gonna be a lawyer?<eos> No, no one's ever holding all the cards.<eos> And I don't give a shit what Mike said, I'm not going folding when I know we can win.<eos> Louis, before you say anything,<eos> Donna told me what happened.<eos> - Harvey, I am so sorry...<eos> - I know you are.<eos> But I didn't come here to scold you.
I love you too, Mommy.<eos> - Stu.<eos> - Donna.<eos> Gotta say, I didn't figure you for a guy who called his mother "Mommy." What can I say, if a man doesn't have the confidence to do that, then he's not really a man.<eos> But I'm guessing you didn't come all the way down here just to evaluate my relationship with the greatest woman on Earth.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> I came here to show you this.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - It's a game-changer.<eos> And I'm letting you in on the ground floor.
What do you need me to do?<eos> I need you to go home, put on something a hell of a lot nicer, and meet me at this address in an hour.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey, sweetie.<eos> I'll be done in a few minutes.<eos> - How's your day?<eos> - Fine.<eos> Louis, we talked about this.<eos> You can share your day with me.<eos> I'm here to cheer you up.
Were you ever gonna God damn tell me?<eos> - Don't speak to me like that.<eos> - You went behind my back when you knew how I felt about this.<eos> No, I went behind your back because I knew how you felt about it.<eos> Is that supposed to make it okay?<eos> No, look, I was the one that didn't want to let things get too risky, but when Harvey laid it out for me, I decided that it wasn't.<eos> Then why didn't you come to me first?<eos> Because you're the one that says forgiveness is easier to ask for than permission.<eos> That's a bullshit reason.<eos> Then how about focusing on the fact that I did it for you?
I don't want you to have that look for the rest of your life.<eos> Rachel, I was upset.<eos> It had just happened.<eos> No, Mike, that's just it. It hadn't.<eos> You've been living with this for so long, that's why you gave Harvey the go-ahead to begin with.<eos> I did that because I had to watch Oliver fail and there's nothing I could do about it.<eos> And if it wasn't Oliver, it was going to be someone else.<eos> Or something else.<eos> There's always gonna be some reminder that you weren't a lawyer.<eos> And it would eat away at you, because it's what you're meant to be.
- Louis...<eos> - Rachel, when Sheila found out, she said I wasn't her soul mate anymore.<eos> But that was Sheila, Louis.<eos> And the key phrase is "she found out."<eos> You didn't tell her.<eos> So you were okay when Mike told you?<eos> No, I wouldn't say that I was okay with it.<eos> But I love him.<eos> That's why I forgave him.<eos> I can't guarantee that Tara will forgive you, but I can tell you that if she finds out some other way, then she won't.
That's why I forgave him.<eos> I can't guarantee that Tara will forgive you, but I can tell you that if she finds out some other way, then she won't.<eos> Thank you, Rachel.<eos> I appreciate your time.<eos> Thank you for sitting down with us.<eos> It's our pleasure.<eos> I'm Andrew and this is Russell.<eos> - I'm Donna.<eos> - And my name is Benjamin.<eos> - Mind if I call you Ben?
Mike, I'm not trying to be an asshole, but we went to a lot of trouble to get that shit on Palmer and you looked like you wanted to kill me.<eos> So how do I know you're not gonna wanna change your mind?<eos> 'Cause I wanna be a lawyer.<eos> I don't care how we do it.<eos> Take out your wallet, pay for this coffee, and let's bring this thing home.<eos> Well, that was the most amazing 27 minutes of my entire life.<eos> Which part?<eos> When you sat there with your mouth glued shut or when you shit the bed describing the operating system?<eos> My God, I knew I should have stopped after the design specs.<eos> Benjamin, I'm teasing you.
Now get going, I'm gonna see you back at the firm.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I accidentally forgot my pen in the conference room.<eos> I have one you can borrow.<eos> Benjamin, when I say accidentally, I mean intentionally because it gives me an excuse to go back in there and eavesdrop on what they're saying about us.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> Can I come with you?<eos> - No, I need to do this alone.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because when they see me without you, they're gonna think it's two against one and they'll make me an offer to cut you out.
In fact, they don't want anything to do with the Donna.<eos> - It's my fault, isn't it?<eos> - Benjamin...<eos> You don't have to protect my feelings.<eos> A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and I know that's what I am.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> It turns out I am.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You have designed an incredible product.<eos> And I don't want to hold you back.
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and I know that's what I am.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> It turns out I am.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You have designed an incredible product.<eos> And I don't want to hold you back.<eos> Which is why, as of right now, I am dissolving our partnership so you can take it out on your own.<eos> Where the hell do you think you're going?<eos> We're partners...<eos> I'd rather throw the Donna into the ocean than move forward without you.
Tara, say something.<eos> Say what?<eos> You just told me you found out you were working with a criminal and you turned it into a promotion.<eos> I know that, but you said we should get to know each other.<eos> What do you want me to say, Louis?<eos> I didn't know what your favorite movie was.<eos> Or what side of the bed you like.<eos> But I thought at least I knew what kind of man you were.<eos> Tara, please.<eos> This is the thing I'm most ashamed about in my life and I'm telling you to show you that I'm never gonna hide anything from you.
Because I don't want somebody working here who doesn't listen to my advice.<eos> Harvey, I still don't think you understand.<eos> When this thing is over, I am not coming back here.<eos> - Mike...<eos> - I told you, I want to do good.<eos> - Then do good here.<eos> - And I also told you that the only reason I agreed to this whole thing in the first place was because I couldn't stand to watch someone like Oliver fail and not be able to help him.<eos> And people like Oliver don't work in places like this.<eos> They work in places like that.<eos> And people like you shouldn't be working anywhere.
Rachel, whatever you're doing, you need to put it down and start looking for every single instance where a person was admitted to the Bar and the vote wasn't unanimous.<eos> Mike, what's going on?<eos> Anita Gibbs got herself onto the board.<eos> Then what we should be doing is finding a way to get her kicked off. Harvey's working on it.<eos> But in the meantime, I need to know the ins and outs of this committee, because while she's on it, she's gonna use every dirty trick in the book to end this thing before it gets started.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm gonna go hole myself up in the library and start preparing answers to every dirty question I can think of.<eos> Louis, are you okay?<eos> I'm fine, Donna.<eos> What can I do for you?
Unless Benjamin can get you below 30...<eos> He can't.<eos> But Stu says we can negotiate with whoever holds the patent, get them to give us an exclusion, and we'll still be able to move forward with The Donna.<eos> Donna, this is exactly what I need.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Tara and I got into a huge fight.<eos> She's deciding right now if we're gonna stay together.<eos> This is exactly what I needed to take my mind off it.<eos> Louis, I don't mean to sound insensitive, but this is incredibly important to me.<eos> I know you, and if this is gonna make you go in there and blow this thing up, I can't have that.
And how exactly are we gonna do that?<eos> We're gonna start by you telling me everything there is to know about Walter Samson.<eos> Well, then we might as well give up right now, because Walter Samson is as clean as they come.<eos> - No one is that clean.<eos> - Well, this guy is.<eos> And I didn't sign on...<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You said you were in on this.<eos> And I'm telling you right now, you still are.<eos> Because we moved heaven and earth to get you out of hot water, and I got no problem putting you right back in.
You're not an asshole, Oliver.<eos> God damn it, Mike!<eos> You told me you didn't have to tell Nathan because there was nothing to tell.<eos> And when I told you that, there wasn't.<eos> But then my deal got put back on the table.<eos> Which means you could have told him this morning.<eos> But you didn't, so now I have to.<eos> Oliver, hey, wait!<eos> Please, hear me out!<eos> I'm not gonna hear you out, Mike.
And the reason I didn't tell Nathan what I did is because I'm just waiting until I can help him even more.<eos> Help how?<eos> By being a shady lawyer?<eos> By being someone who wouldn't have lost Sofia Price her home.<eos> I cannot believe you just said that to me.<eos> I said it because it's true, and you know it.<eos> Look, I am gonna tell Nathan everything as soon as my hearing is over.<eos> You have my word. Why should I believe the word of a liar?<eos> Because of what I did for those miners and the clinic.<eos> And if that's not enough, how about what I did for you?
Actually, you do.<eos> Article 4, 16A.<eos> Applicants are allowed a witness as a rebuttal for an accusation leveled by a committee member.<eos> That article hasn't been cited in 30 years.<eos> Maybe that's because no applicant has ever had to stand before the person who put them away.<eos> You make a point.<eos> We'll pick this up first thing in the morning with your witness. Thank you.<eos> Rachel, that was exactly what I needed.<eos> If you hadn't done that...<eos> I know. But right now I'm more concerned with the fact that she's turning them against you.
Because the Mike you met that night in prison never would have told you the truth just now.<eos> Julius, please.<eos> I need this.<eos> This is the address.<eos> It's tomorrow at 9:00.<eos> I don't have anyone else.<eos> Mike, hey.<eos> Harvey, tell me you got some good news.<eos> I do. I took care of Seidel.<eos> He's still gonna back you.
I did fight for you, Donna, I swear.<eos> They got us dead to rights.<eos> There's nothing more I can do.<eos> Bullshit. Louis Litt does not roll over for anybody.<eos> He didn't roll over, Donna.<eos> I went over it with Benjamin, and we can't get the overlap under 30%.<eos> I also ran it by my own attorney and he was shocked at what Louis was able to get us.<eos> So you're telling me you want to take it?<eos> We do.<eos> But The Donna wouldn't even exist without you, and we're partners, so if you don't want to, then we won't.
I mean Gibbs offered me a deal.<eos> Mike goes on record admitting I knew he was a fraud, she'll vote to let him in the Bar.<eos> Are you insane?<eos> You do that, it won't be a little time off.<eos> You'll get disbarred.<eos> And by then, he'll be a lawyer.<eos> And we can argue that he said that just to appease Gibbs.<eos> Bullshit. You do this, two out of three names on that wall will be gone, and I won't be able to keep this firm going.<eos> And if you can't, we'll have done it for Mike.<eos> Zane will hire you.
Louis, I owe him. Well, what about what you owe me?<eos> You said we were partners.<eos> We are partners.<eos> Which is why I came to you with this.<eos> No, you didn't come to ask my permission.<eos> You came to tell me that you were gonna do this.<eos> And what if I did?<eos> Then you're not just an asshole.<eos> You're an idiot, because there's no way<eos> Mike Ross ever agrees to trading you for him.
I don't care what it is.<eos> I'm not getting into the Bar if it means getting you kicked out.<eos> Mike, she wants me.<eos> She always has. No, Harvey.<eos> She wants both of us.<eos> And she's not going to stop until she gets both of us.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> And if you don't get that, then she's got you right where she wants you.<eos> So you're just gonna sit there tomorrow and let her take everything away from you?
- You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> And if you don't get that, then she's got you right where she wants you.<eos> So you're just gonna sit there tomorrow and let her take everything away from you?<eos> She's not taking anything away.<eos> She's keeping things exactly the way they are.<eos> You mean working for that clinic.<eos> Harvey, I'm lucky to still have a job at that clinic.<eos> So tomorrow morning, I'm gonna go in there with my head held high.<eos> But what I'm not gonna do is let her strip you of everything that you are.
Well, you really want to do good?<eos> Donate half of this to the clinic.<eos> You'll fund the place for a year.<eos> So that's what you think I'm all about.<eos> Just giving money.<eos> No. But I think you're about more than just working at that place.<eos> And you know it.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm offering you a deal.<eos> One for you, one for me.
I'm offering you a deal... One for you, one for me.<eos> You are not getting my office.<eos> Yes, I am 'cause she's gone, Harvey.<eos> It's time for you to take the reins.<eos> I'm here to ask you out.
And I liked it.<eos> That's good 'cause I wasn't sure you would.<eos> Of course you weren't.<eos> You don't really know me yet.<eos> Till yesterday, we'd spent about 50 hours together, and we'd spent most of them talking about you.<eos> I know, and that's what I love about our relationship.<eos> - Harvey...<eos> - Paula...<eos> Before you say what I think you're gonna say, let me say you may know me better than anyone.<eos> And now I'd like to get to know you too.
And, from what I've seen, nobody wipes the floor with Mr. Ackerman.<eos> Nice office.<eos> Mine's better.<eos> Isn't that the same line you used when you thought your Ferrari was better than my cobra?<eos> It was better.<eos> And a good line never gets old.<eos> - Tell that to your hairline.<eos> - Tell that to your waistline.<eos> Good to see you, Harvey.<eos> What brings you down?
Mike, if you let this asshole bully you, you're gonna be backing down for the rest of your life.<eos> I'm not backing down. I am buying time so that I can stop this bullshit from ever happening again.<eos> You don't need time.<eos> I have a way. Stop apologizing and start intimidating.<eos> Well, that's a hell of a slogan, Harvey, but what does it actually mean?<eos> It means you go out, you find a reporter, and you take control of the narrative.<eos> Instead of a lying fraud, you're a hero fighting for redemption.<eos> I don't have time to change my image.<eos> Look, if I lose this case, the only article that's gonna get written is that I never should have been able to practice law in the first place.<eos> Yeah, well, if you can't figure out a way to win without Rachel's help, then maybe I shouldn't have brought you back in the first place because I've had about enough of having every employee I have question every decision I make.

So was I.<eos> But the truth is I guess I'm glad we're rescheduling.<eos> I didn't want to end up focusing on myself like I did the last time.<eos> Why, is something going on?<eos> It's not a big deal.<eos> Harvey, you can talk to me about it.<eos> - But you said before...<eos> - I know what I said before,<eos> - but this is different.<eos> - How? Because you heard me, and you respected my wishes, which means instead of me listening to you as your therapist, you know, I'll be listening to you

You've worked hard to get where you are, and a new person threatens your position in the firm.<eos> That's not...<eos> That's just not it.<eos> The one silver lining of Jessica leaving was that I thought that Harvey would finally turn to me, not only as his partner, but as his friend.<eos> That's not happening now because I'm being replaced.<eos> And you're scared of losing your friend.<eos> What do I do?<eos> I can't tell you that, Louis, but I can tell you it was your behavior that drove Tara away, and, if you keep letting your emotions dictate your behavior, you won't need to worry about being replaced.<eos> You'll drive Harvey away all by yourself.<eos> I'm not sure I've ever seen you here this late.
Then I guess I'll take it.<eos> And leave out the part where you traded admission of guilt in exchange for selfpromotion.<eos> Don't you dare say that to me.<eos> I'm not doing this for myself.<eos> I'm doing it so that pieces of shit like you never try to use my history against my clients again.<eos> Louis, before you say anything...<eos> Harvey, before you say anything, I just wanna say I'm sorry.<eos> You were right.<eos> I was jealous of Alex coming over here, but not because I'm afraid of another lawyer.<eos> I don't understand. See, Harvey, I know you like to make fun of me, and I know I might not mean as much to you as you mean to me, but you're my friend, and, because I don't have many, that friendship
Or the guard downstairs could be head of litigation.<eos> - Are you finished?<eos> - Depends on what you say next.<eos> I'm sorry I said those things about you, and I want you to know I didn't mean any of them.<eos> I'm sorry too, Harvey.<eos> Jessica, you don't need to apologize.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> You were just tearing the statue down.<eos> Just like you saw me do all those years ago, and I didn't like it because the statue was me.<eos> Well, if it's the same to you, I'd like the statue to stay.
I kidnapped the woman you loved and buried her alive.<eos> But it was all in good fun.<eos> I suppose in retrospect it was impolite of me to kill her husband and set her up for the crime.<eos> But William, the look on her face when the verdict came in...<eos> Guilty.<eos> Dr. Ogden, the nature of this crime is such that I have no recourse but to sentence you to be hanged by the neck until you are dead.<eos> Such intense emotion.<eos> William.<eos> Julia.<eos> I'll get you out.
- Alright.<eos> - Sir, this is probably nothing, but 740 Robert Street is at the intersection of Robert and Willcocks.<eos> Robert Wilcox.<eos> I'm sure it's just a coincidence.<eos> No, no, Henry, it isn't a coincidence.<eos> This is the clue that Gillies alluded to.<eos> - What's at the corner of Gerrard and Berkeley?<eos> - Veronica Bowden's house.<eos> She's the girl that Gillies kidnapped.<eos> Veronica, who took you from your bed last night?
I can help you.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> He tried to connect.<eos> That's what he needs.<eos> It has been so hard.<eos> Being alone in that room.<eos> I'm afraid I'm starting to give up.<eos> That would be a tragedy.<eos> The accused stand charged with gender treachery, in violation of Romans.<eos> I know this is a shock for you, Emily.

Please.<eos> Are you an Eye?<eos> Yes.<eos> Now go to bed before I report you.<eos> Okay.<eos> I want you to leave your wife.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait, really?<eos> What do you mean, "Okay"?<eos> Look, I'm in love with you.
Yes.<eos> Now go to bed before I report you.<eos> Okay.<eos> I want you to leave your wife.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait, really?<eos> What do you mean, "Okay"?<eos> Look, I'm in love with you.<eos> What else am I going to do?<eos> I'm in love with you.
I could hardly wait to meet you.<eos> Cool logo.<eos> Is that your company?<eos> Congregations need somewhere to congregate.<eos> Don't make a move until I figure out just what the hell we're walking into.<eos> Whatever it is you're going through, we go through it together.<eos> It's a lot to explain.<eos> Right now, we need to get Willa and get out.<eos> You want to reach the Ocean of Light?<eos> Let Holden go, and I'll take you.
I want you to take me to my brother.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Hey.<eos> Why'd you tell me those things about Ian?<eos> Wanna come in?<eos> Okay.<eos> The other night, you accused Ian and Hollow Sk...<eos> Tom, what are you... what are you trying to prove?<eos> I'm not trying to prove anything.<eos> I'm trying to protect you, the boys.
Wanna come in?<eos> Okay.<eos> The other night, you accused Ian and Hollow Sk...<eos> Tom, what are you... what are you trying to prove?<eos> I'm not trying to prove anything.<eos> I'm trying to protect you, the boys.<eos> Have you heard from Holden?<eos> He called yesterday.<eos> He said he'd be back later on this afternoon.<eos> I'll support you.
We're in a temple.<eos> They're safe havens.<eos> Willa, stop!<eos> Wait!<eos> Holden, what are you doing here?<eos> What's he doing here?<eos> You know full well what he's capable of.<eos> Only he can take us across the bridge and only he can bring us back.<eos> You're a snake!<eos> I should kill you.
I'm a realist.<eos> We created a product to help the world feel better.<eos> Supply-side economics, and we're the supplier.<eos> People will line up all over the planet to get their taste.<eos> So that's all this is?<eos> What?<eos> I may not believe in heaven... but I do believe in money.<eos> What were you thinking, coming back here?<eos> I was thinking of you.<eos> I was trying to protect you.
Don't!<eos> Hey.<eos> No!<eos> I can't.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> Because... because I've seen this.<eos> When I blow up the bridge... you die.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I had you in my hands... and I lost you.
What do you mean?<eos> I had you in my hands... and I lost you.<eos> I thought it was a memory, but it wasn't.<eos> It just didn't happen yet.<eos> Holden, we're running out of time.<eos> I watched you fall.<eos> We can't let those things cross over.<eos> I can't lose you.<eos> This is what you meant to do.<eos> I believe in you.
Yeah, you shot at me.<eos> And?<eos> How is the boy wonder?<eos> Is he still breathing?<eos> That's sort of why I'm here.<eos> I... want to help you.<eos> And him.<eos> Unless that's a prescription for some groovy painkillers...<eos> Arthur's location.<eos> I need something from you first.
They'll be at your house tonight.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> My Commander.<eos> Small dick, big mouth.<eos> It looks kind of weird without all the dead bodies, doesn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I guess you get used to things being one way.<eos> Hurry up in there.<eos> Coming.<eos> I left a clean dress for you.
My Commander.<eos> Small dick, big mouth.<eos> It looks kind of weird without all the dead bodies, doesn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I guess you get used to things being one way.<eos> Hurry up in there.<eos> Coming.<eos> I left a clean dress for you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> As soon as you're dressed, Mrs. Waterford wants to see you.
You look very handsome.<eos> Thank you.<eos> They're having dinner at the home of a very powerful Commander.<eos> Let them be nervous.<eos> Blessed be the fruit.<eos> May the Lord open.<eos> How's your day going?<eos> You look pretty.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I wore it just for you.
I know.<eos> There's still going to be a lot of pain.<eos> There's pain now.<eos> So much of it.<eos> We're saving them.<eos> We're doing God's work.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> He...<eos> He wants to see you in his office.
We've got a kid.<eos> I know that.<eos> There's a difference.<eos> I'm just saying we should've left when she did.<eos> I know.<eos> Is that him?<eos> Whitford, right?<eos> Guess, we should've set a password or something.<eos> You look like your mama, little June.<eos> I'd know you anywhere.
Fuck you.<eos> - Shit. - It's not his jacket.<eos> I topped off the tank and we got some ammo but there are patrols on the highway.<eos> We should move on.<eos> Okay.<eos> Help me with him.<eos> Grab what you can.<eos> We gotta go.<eos> You know at some point, you're gonna have to stop collecting strays.<eos> I should've stopped before I found you.
We gotta go.<eos> You know at some point, you're gonna have to stop collecting strays.<eos> I should've stopped before I found you.<eos> You got him?<eos> We got another one.<eos> Guardians shot him.<eos> Clear a spot.<eos> We need to lay him down.<eos> Don't worry, friend.<eos> We'll fix you up.
It's all right.<eos> Look, they're patrolling all over.<eos> You guys can take Campbell Pond Road as far as it goes.<eos> I called a friend, so if you guys can make it past Jackman, he's gonna meet you at the border.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> No worries.<eos> This is pretty fucked up.<eos> Come on.<eos> May the Lord guide your steps and bring you to your June and your Hannah.
No.<eos> I'm not...<eos> If you go back, you're gonna die.<eos> You're gonna die and leave them all on their own.<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't...<eos> He's coming.<eos> Smart.<eos> I wasted a whole prayer on you.
When?<eos> Three weeks ago.<eos> So, she's alive?<eos> We believe so, yes.<eos> Sorry...<eos> Sorry.<eos> Can I have a moment?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I love you
- A month?<eos> - Five weeks.<eos> I called in a favor to get you that.<eos> Yeah, it wasn't a good fit.<eos> Lot of bad fits.<eos> Two months at Walmart, three weeks' construction.<eos> You know how this looks?<eos> Like I can't hold a job.<eos> Okay.<eos> Honestly, I don't know what else I could do for you.
Who can blame Him?<eos> There's nothing you can do about it.<eos> Now, there you're wrong.<eos> There's this group that wants to set things right, clean up this country.<eos> We have chapters in 30 states.<eos> I head up one of them.<eos> We're called the Sons of Jacob.<eos> Come with me to a meeting.<eos> I think you'll like what you hear.<eos> Who knows, maybe there's a job in it for you.
Let 'em go.<eos> Let 'em through.<eos> You're very quiet.<eos> Aren't you enjoying yourself?<eos> I was just...<eos> It's so beautiful at night.<eos> I don't usually get to see it like this.<eos> But tonight you aren't you.<eos> Sir, we're almost at the river.<eos> I'm gonna have to ask you to get down.
Pleasure doing business with you.<eos> Hello, there.<eos> I haven't seen you before.<eos> Davidson.<eos> She's with me.<eos> An evening rental.<eos> Of course, sir.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Outstanding work with the Mexico delegation.<eos> Thought I'd lost you.
Take a hike, will ya?<eos> Did you pick this out?<eos> Government issue.<eos> Why, isn't it me?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm great.<eos> What about you?<eos> How's Waterford?<eos> Forget him.<eos> I just want to hear about you.
She must have shit a brick when you got back to the Red Center.<eos> They didn't take me back.<eos> I was a "corrupting influence."<eos> They took me somewhere else.<eos> After they finished their questions, they gave me a choice, The Colonies or Jezebel's.<eos> It's a few good years before your pussy wears out.<eos> All the booze and drugs you want. Food's good.<eos> We only work nights.<eos> I mean, it's not so bad.<eos> We're gonna find a way to get you out of here, okay?
No one gets out. Luke got out!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank God.<eos> But he isn't us, and he isn't in here.<eos> We're alone, June.<eos> Just take care of yourself.<eos> You need to go.<eos> Come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> I love you, okay?
We're alone, June.<eos> Just take care of yourself.<eos> You need to go.<eos> Come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> I love you, okay?<eos> Me, too.<eos> So fucking much.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We'll get you home before you turn into a pumpkin.
Previously on The Handmaid's Tale...<eos> Tonight, I'm taking you out.<eos> I thought these kinds of places were forbidden.<eos> Who are all these people?<eos> All women who couldn't assimilate.<eos> I'm so sorry I left you at the train!<eos> Janine said you were dead.<eos> They gave me a choice. The Colonies or Jezebel's.<eos> We're gonna find a way to get you out of here.
Blessed be.<eos> Blessed be.<eos> Blessed be.<eos> Aunt Lydia?<eos> Yes?<eos> What is it?<eos> Does she seem all right?<eos> Considering?<eos> She's tougher than you think.<eos> Let her be an example to you.
I don't know.<eos> Figure it out.<eos> What...<eos> What's in the package?<eos> I just know it's important.<eos> And don't open it either.<eos> Hide it until someone contacts you.<eos> Look, you came to me.<eos> And this is what they need now.<eos> Can they count on you or not?
He's coming for me.<eos> He's coming for me.<eos> Did you like that?<eos> Yes.<eos> Let me know next time.<eos> You don't have to be quiet here.<eos> You can be free.<eos> I'll remember that, for the next time.<eos> You're getting ahead of yourself.<eos> And I don't want to spoil you.
You saw her the last time we were here.<eos> You think I don't pay attention, but I do.<eos> I know you know Ruby.<eos> I know her, too.<eos> I thought you'd welcome this little reunion.<eos> Aren't you friends?<eos> Not that kind of friend.<eos> Of course not.<eos> Relax.<eos> I did something nice for you.
And then we'll be free.<eos> I can't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't 'cause of my daughter.<eos> Janine.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Janine, you have to do what's best for your daughter now.<eos> You have to give her the chance to grow up.<eos> Mommy loves you.<eos> Mommy loves you so much.
I can't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't 'cause of my daughter.<eos> Janine.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Janine, you have to do what's best for your daughter now.<eos> You have to give her the chance to grow up.<eos> Mommy loves you.<eos> Mommy loves you so much.<eos> Mommy loves you so much.
Listen to me.<eos> Janine, you have to do what's best for your daughter now.<eos> You have to give her the chance to grow up.<eos> Mommy loves you.<eos> Mommy loves you so much.<eos> Mommy loves you so much.<eos> Make sure she knows that, June, please.<eos> I promise.<eos> Bye.<eos> May the Lord keep you in His mercy.
Which Saint Ursula is it?<eos> There's at least two that I know of.<eos> There was one who was martyred by the Huns.<eos> The poor girl, she got it in the neck -- literally.<eos> And then there's Saint Ursula Micaela Morata - she actually had the gift of bilocation. - Bilocation?<eos> Yeah, the ability to be in two places at once.<eos> So which one is it?<eos> The one where you drink a lot of rum and party wildly in the street.<eos> Ah, I like her the best.<eos> Thought I'd find you in the nearest bar.
That's what I came up with.<eos> Want to try it again?<eos> What, did I get the chord wrong?<eos> No. Perfect on the chords. Perfect.<eos> Um, the... there's joy in this song. Joy.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm... I'm not really feeling your joy.<eos> I'm not really feeling joy.<eos> Well, what's getting you down?
That's his area of concentration.<eos> Yeah. Let's throw that to John.<eos> Lacking a little sex appeal here.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Archduke Sebastian Room.<eos> Five minutes.<eos> Sorry.<eos> John.<eos> John.<eos> Ooh, I just want to hug you.
Plio. All right.<eos> All right. Cool. Rob.<eos> John, it's happening.<eos> What is?<eos> My life.<eos> Starting now.<eos> Let's catch up later.<eos> We'll catch up. Yeah, man.<eos> I got something I got to do now.<eos> Yeah. We got you, scumbag.
You see, Ted?<eos> You enjoying Luxembourg?<eos> Yeah.<eos> For the most part, yeah. Thanks.<eos> It's good food.<eos> How am I going to talk to these guys?<eos> I speak Portuguese. I could translate.<eos> Brazil has the fourth largest transport field in the world.<eos> It's my primary field. I could do it.<eos> I don't want them to see you.
- Yeah.<eos> You came all the way to Luxembourg to see if I'm all right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay, here's what we're going to do.<eos> First thing, you're gonna get some sleep.<eos> Then you're gonna eat.<eos> And then we're gonna have some fun.<eos> You pick the fun.<eos> Can I come?<eos> Well, it wouldn't be much fun without you, Eddie.
In 1563, King Gerald was facing down a rebellion.<eos> His people were starving due to a blighted apple harvest.<eos> They blamed the aging Gerald and believed their king had gone soft in his advanced years.<eos> I need to know you're okay.<eos> So don't hold back.<eos> Spill it, kid.<eos> The detective asked to interview me about the thing.<eos> The killing?<eos> The killing.<eos> Of a man who was trying to choke you to death.

He's here alone.<eos> Are you?<eos> You're supposed to be here alone, but are you actually alone?<eos> Yeah. We have recess, too.<eos> Yeah. It's awesome.<eos> So anyway, remember, you can't lose from the sidelines.<eos> Let's find his Edward.<eos> How?<eos> Let's use Edward.<eos> We find the guy, we get the bag back, and we get you out of Luxembourg before there's more trouble with this investigation.
And I don't know for the other one.<eos> I'll select Tangled.<eos> Can we arrange for an employee to do that now before I arrive in the room?<eos> I would only like to see that film on the television.<eos> Yes, we can.<eos> Who was your hallway pal?<eos> A stranger whose laptop I found in the bar and then I gave it back to him and then he was grateful.<eos> I'll say.<eos> My God.<eos> You know, I can't believe I found you.
Thank God.<eos> We should hit them with, "Afternoon Spray."<eos> All right?<eos> I... I was, like, lost.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay?<eos> "Afternoon Spray."<eos> Okay.<eos> Here we go.<eos> We love you, Rob!
I want to crush this fuck.<eos> That glass... it's not a barrier.<eos> It's an asset.<eos> It's what makes you good.<eos> You see things differently.<eos> That's an edge.<eos> The Attorney General's called me down to Washington.<eos> She's gonna fire me.<eos> Take out an enemy, a big, hard-to-kill one.<eos> It's tough to fire you then.
No.<eos> We reduce his edge.<eos> Is this, um... is this last night's or this morning's?<eos> What if I don't want to answer?<eos> Well, maybe shower before heading to the office.<eos> I already did.<eos> Well, I'm thinking maybe you hit it again.<eos> Heard Tisch will support your bid.<eos> Seems likely.<eos> I wish I could be in there negotiating for you.
Axe, I've been your wingman for the past three years.<eos> I've been close to the final table every time.<eos> Yeah, which is another way of saying you missed the final table three years running.<eos> You know one of the things that I really like about the NFL?<eos> The cheerleaders?<eos> Uh, yeah, yeah, when I was 12, yeah.<eos> But I'm all grown now, so I was gonna say the contracts.<eos> No other league gives fewer guarantees.<eos> You can sign for seven years, $120 million.<eos> Yet you shit the bed, they cut you in the spring, you're back knocking on doors again.
You can sign for seven years, $120 million.<eos> Yet you shit the bed, they cut you in the spring, you're back knocking on doors again.<eos> So you're cutting me loose.<eos> Well, I wouldn't say it that way, but yes.<eos> For that little...<eos> Hey.<eos> For Taylor?<eos> Everything I measure myself by has been called into question.<eos> Todd.<eos> This is for you by way of an apology for putting you in an awkward position.
Hey.<eos> For Taylor?<eos> Everything I measure myself by has been called into question.<eos> Todd.<eos> This is for you by way of an apology for putting you in an awkward position.<eos> Do I really look like I need $5,000 worth of spa treatments?<eos> You look like you wouldn't give yourself the gift of peace of mind, so I did.<eos> So you're my personal Dalai Lama?<eos> I did spend part of last summer in the company of Rinpoche.<eos> You know, I could actually introduce you, if you want.
We've done this dance before.<eos> You're gonna want insight into Axe or...<eos> There are lots of villains at the tournament tomorrow.<eos> Axe is only one.<eos> Look, I want to perform at my best.<eos> And like you said, it's scary when you feel the pressure.<eos> I can admit that.<eos> I'm reluctant.<eos> I am offering you a challenge and a chance to redefine yourself in the industry... as independent, separate from Axe in every way.<eos> All the top funds will see you as a resource, not as his accoutrement.
The whole "my dick is bigger than yours" thing, it wasn't for me.<eos> You already knew... about my entire player history.<eos> That wasn't a guess.<eos> Look... I need to win this thing.<eos> I put somebody on it early this morning.<eos> I had a feeling, pulled your résumé... saw some game-theory strengths... looked into it a little bit more.<eos> How'd you clock that I knew?<eos> The way you listened to my answers, the cant of your head.<eos> You weren't receiving new information.<eos> Can I convince you... to try one more time to play?
And if we'd just met, I would believe that that was the whole thing.<eos> The rest is strategy.<eos> It's tactics.<eos> If Boyd is convicted, I'll be on the inside. I'll understand what works, what doesn't.<eos> He's like a soldier.<eos> We send him up front.<eos> He's a scout.<eos> He brings back Intel, or he becomes cannon fodder, and that brings a different kind of Intel about where we can step and where we can't.<eos> Lawrence Boyd isn't exactly cannon fodder.<eos> Babe... everyone in the world, apart from you, me, and the kids is cannon fodder.
I thought, "What would Axe do?"<eos> Maybe it was a little soon.<eos> Well, you know, you've made every one of these pricks millions, and yet they turn away.<eos> When this is over, you'll remind them.<eos> Fuckin' A.<eos> For now, I'm just taking a lap, marking the hugs and snubs in my big book, then I'm heading out of town... Jackson Hole.<eos> Good.<eos> Clear your head.<eos> We'll talk when you get back.<eos> Hey, great to see you, buddy.
Clear your head.<eos> We'll talk when you get back.<eos> Hey, great to see you, buddy.<eos> Always piggybacking on my moves.<eos> Maybe when you embrace someone, it's a move, but when I do it, it's an expression of profound sentiment.<eos> You know my performance coach, right?<eos> Glad you could pitch in.<eos> He needs all the help he can get.<eos> I've won three of those bad boys.<eos> How about you?
I work for myself.<eos> I bet that's what his masseuse and manicurist tell themselves, too.<eos> Today we're here to raise max dollars for charity.<eos> And to see who's the biggest swinging dick on the street.<eos> I'll bet it's not gonna be that guy.<eos> Everyone, take your seats.<eos> Paul, this is my dear friend Lawrence Boyd.<eos> Treat him as you would me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Larry, do what this man advises, and he will lead you to the promised land.
Never gone out before the final table in this thing ever.<eos> I've never called out the most powerful company in the energy sector as a fraud and been right, so we're even.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, it took you long enough.<eos> Anything to report?<eos> They're about to take off.<eos> It's only Boyd on the flight.<eos> Well, he might make a phone call.<eos> She might overhear something.<eos> I'll keep you posted.
Well, maybe that'll unnerve him.<eos> Or maybe you'll blink like crazy when you pick up a good hand.<eos> Take a breath.<eos> Relax your features.<eos> Hundred and fifty.<eos> Call.<eos> One fifty.<eos> Call.<eos> You're drawing?<eos> Against you?
He seems to think that you don't get something out of winning.<eos> He wanted me to pull you from this entire event.<eos> You didn't listen.<eos> Eh, he may not be very good at his job.<eos> You love winning.<eos> I do?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I keep going back to why you quit the live game in college.<eos> I didn't like...<eos> I think it's that you didn't like that it put the two things that really fucking matter to you... winning and being thought of as good... in direct conflict.
I know you believe that, but I choose to take a different lesson.<eos> It's not a choice.<eos> Now go back down to that table.<eos> And if, when you see Krakow, you think that maybe he will become a friend, then go ahead.<eos> Take your hands off the bars and let him ride on by.<eos> Do you want to know a secret?<eos> Your boss bet me a million dollars that you would outlast me.<eos> So, you fuck up, it's a million dollar mistake.<eos> Good to know.<eos> How do you think he's gonna feel remembering that you cost him a mill every time he looks at you?
Check.<eos> One-point-seven million.<eos> I'm lost.<eos> They might be making a stop-and-go... or surrendering.<eos> Call.<eos> Check.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think Taylor's ahead and has to trust it.<eos> Time.<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?
Michaela, you did great, above and beyond.<eos> So, I believe I'm off the hook?<eos> You are.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's over, then?<eos> Your part's done, but the case isn't.<eos> You're not calling me.<eos> I get it.<eos> I can't have anything brought up in court that might look...<eos> You know, I checked, and my trade wasn't illegal, but I went ahead and did it for you, anyway.
- and he poisoned the entire town?<eos> - To get her attention.<eos> See, Wynonna's not a flowers and chocolate kind of a girl.<eos> D'you anticipate charging Earp as an accessory after the fact?<eos> We're weighing the evidence, considering our options.<eos> Thanks, Pam.<eos> So no parade down main street in my honour then?<eos> I'd settle for a smoothie and one sad stripper.<eos> Look, the town needed a plausible, nonsupernatural explanation for what happened.<eos> - And they already hate you, so.
- Few weeks.<eos> - Weeks?<eos> You can't be Black Badge.<eos> You couldn't sneak up on a corpse.<eos> And your holds are atrocious.<eos> I'll have you know I'm kind of a big deal around here.<eos> I'm the Earp heir.<eos> Destined to fight Wyatt's revenant demons.<eos> End a curse?<eos> I took you out with a lamp.
Did Bobo do something to you?<eos> Don't deflect, I hate it when you do that.<eos> Wynonna, listen, 24 hours ago you shot our sister.<eos> Yeah, and it sucked.<eos> - She sucked.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Not helping.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Listen, I need you to be OK.<eos> So why am I dragging you into this again?
- We're not going to the trailer park.<eos> - What is this?<eos> This, Nicole, is for the greater good.<eos> What?<eos> OK, if you want me to trust you, you've gotta tell me the plan.<eos> Preferably before I find you holding an axe over my head.<eos> Wynonna made me promise not to.<eos> She's my sister, Nicole.<eos> I have to protect her now more than ever.<eos> Hey... just like I need to protect you.
You could come in.<eos> I'm gonna take a shower.<eos> Well, then I'll leave you to it.<eos> I'm sorry I left.<eos> No.<eos> No, you had to.<eos> I wanted you to.<eos> Of course.<eos> I didn't have a choice, right?<eos> He would've killed you.
I tried to help her.<eos> Yeah, you're a real saint.<eos> What have you been up to the last 24 hours?<eos> At home.<eos> With Billy and my nan.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Who's your other mate?<eos> The one that ran away.<eos> Who?<eos> When we picked you up, there was three of you.
- Sure.<eos> - What are you having?<eos> - Erm...<eos> I'll just have the same as you.<eos> There you go.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> Eight years ago, we had this young PC --<eos> Charlie Hopkins.<eos> He was not much older than you.
Looked like you was having some family trouble.<eos> A son like that needs to be brought in line.<eos> Don't fill me with confidence seeing you being talked to by a cripple like that.<eos> Shit!<eos> We're looking for your mate Eddie.<eos> I've not seen him since you last picked us up.<eos> Well, he's your mate.<eos> Has he not dropped by?<eos> - No.<eos> - Shall we take you in, Billy?
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> You're a nobody, old man.<eos> You'll return the plans, and I'll find someone more obedient.<eos> I was pulling schemes like this when you were still shitting in your nappies.<eos> Now, my boys have already started.<eos> So back off and let us get on with it.<eos> All right.<eos> Untwist your knickers, Clifford.<eos> I've got people on the outside relying on you, so stop messing about and get it done.
Or next time, I'll take more than just your wife's purse.<eos> Right, you four with me.<eos> Where'd you go for that warrant?<eos> Timbuktu?<eos> Wait here.<eos> With me.<eos> All right?<eos> Hi.<eos> Make sure nobody goes into the bedrooms before I do.<eos> One of the lads saw you and Bradfield outside the section house the other night.
- But you warned them?<eos> - Of course. I told them to get out.<eos> You go.<eos> I'll stay here and wait for your dad and John.<eos> I'll go to Reg's place and meet you there.<eos> David, stop.<eos> Wait there.<eos> Take it all.<eos> Wait until dark, then get yourself away from here.<eos> I love you, Ma.
Get this bag of piss down the station.<eos> Sarge.<eos> - Tennison, are you hurt?<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> It's... It's not my blood.<eos> It's...<eos> It's David Bentley's.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Let's get you to the station and get you cleaned up.
You wanna be like Sister?<eos> I'd be lucky.<eos> She's the best person I know.<eos> You sure this is the right way?<eos> Oh, there's a staircase around here somewhere.<eos> Should take us right to the drop spot.<eos> I call dibs on all the edibles.<eos> Posting this shit on the Internet?<eos> It's like he's throwing it right in my face.<eos> God, she even looks like you.
I have Morton's neuroma.<eos> Yeah, well, I probably have Wolfgang Puck's herpes, but I don't go around announcing it.<eos> Did you think you were being the cool girl or something?<eos> Don't you know the cool girl always ends up alone or fat?<eos> Or both in my cousin April's case.<eos> I thought it'd be like one of those open-minded relationships, you know?<eos> I think you mean open relationship.<eos> They can be quite wonderful...<eos> Don't correct her!<eos> Who asked you anyway?
Come on!<eos> Remember, you must keep the circle unbroken.<eos> Whatever you do, do not break the circle.<eos> Hold up.<eos> What if we gotta pee?<eos> Do not break the circle.<eos> Poussey... we welcome you to this room.<eos> As we sit here... we make this a place of welcoming.<eos> Everyone, tell Poussey we welcome her.<eos> We welcome you, Poussey.
Hold up.<eos> What if we gotta pee?<eos> Do not break the circle.<eos> Poussey... we welcome you to this room.<eos> As we sit here... we make this a place of welcoming.<eos> Everyone, tell Poussey we welcome her.<eos> We welcome you, Poussey.<eos> Taystee?<eos> She gets it. She welcome.<eos> Poussey, Suzanne is here to listen to you.
All right, commercial break.<eos> What's going on in here?<eos> I'm a little busy.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Look, I need to be sure that somebody keeps their mouth shut about a certain something that they overheard about somebody else in the bathroom.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it's fine.<eos> I gotta go weigh in.<eos> Look, do you hear what I'm telling you?<eos> I have information on you, too, you know.
Bye.<eos> Yo, why that judge look so familiar?<eos> 'Cause she's famous.<eos> That's the counterfeit cunt from Connecticut right there.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Is this where you go when you want nothing to do with that shit?<eos> Who's in charge out here?<eos> She is.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I recognize you from the chapel.
I'm really sorry.<eos> Ugh... pick up your face.<eos> All right, beeyotches! I know you all got Tammy's letter in your boxes, yet I'm still seeing, like, a thousand N-O's around this room.<eos> So to recap...<eos> I don't care how cold it is outside.<eos> No hideous puffy coats.<eos> No pants.<eos> And no flat-ass fucking hair.<eos> I mean, Jesus H...<eos> Yeah, I'm talking to you, tits-on-a-stick Stacey.
You hear that, Reg?<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> I promise you, Judy is fine.<eos> I am not fine!<eos> Are you eatin'?<eos> You do not eat during my billable hours, you son of a bitch!<eos> Now find me a helicopter and a blindfold for my flicker vertigo, and get me the fuck out of here.<eos> Thing One and Thing Two are right outside.<eos> Best to hang tight.<eos> I'm sure they'll have you out of there soon.
This is a big knife.<eos> You know what? Why don't you go stir the pot? 'Cause you're good at that.<eos> We'll alternate between intercostal and diaphragmatic breathing.<eos> Take a deep inhale and we'll hold it for a count of ten.<eos> One, two...<eos> Clearly, it's working great.<eos> Think of this as nature's CPAP machine.<eos> Now when you inhale, make sure to contract your lower abs and squeeze your Kegels.<eos> New one from Reg.<eos> "Concerned about you.
Shh! Yo, Vause, the fuck was that in the chapel?<eos> Just exercising my First Amendment rights, Ruiz.<eos> Didn't mean to interrupt your Gitmo torture parade.<eos> Are you looking for a Nazi happy face on your arm, too?<eos> Right now, there's three of us and one of you.<eos> So are you sure you want to be getting in my face?<eos> You think blonde Katy Perry and...<eos> I never seen you before.<eos> Um, I'm...<eos> 'Cause we all look like janky versions of white celebrities to you.
Can I get my drugs now, too?<eos> I wanna not feel this way anymore.<eos> I'm sorry, all right.<eos> You can't cheat grief.<eos> Unfortunately.<eos> I guess I can give you some sleeping pills, huh?<eos> But you're gonna have to wake up eventually.<eos> I can give you some Klonopin, or whatever expired off-brand shit version they have here, and, uh, you know, you'll feel good and numb for a while, but then you'll spill a glass of water or trip on your shoelace, find yourself weeping for four hours, no idea why.<eos> I mean, uh, I could give you some Dilaudid.<eos> Nah, you're gonna get addicted to heroin, get sent down to Max for doing some stupid junkie shit, find yourself sucking off a CO in a closet for one last hit, and, you know, maybe realize that you were just hopelessly in love with an incredible, insane, beautiful woman who's never going to love you back.
I mean, why can't they let us have cell phones all the time?<eos> Because it zaps your brain.<eos> Look at this one.<eos> New guards is what we need.<eos> No more of these nasty fucks.<eos> Oh, look at this lady who dressed her cat in a freaking bathing suit.<eos> Oh, what about only lady guards?<eos> Oh, my God, no.<eos> No. Women can be so mean to each other.<eos> I mean, except for you, I'm really mean to women.
They should've begun their training years ago, but it's not too late.<eos> Rats!<eos> Their new guardian is the most fierce and formidable member of our organization.<eos> Wait, not Snicket?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Isn't he dead?<eos> Is he?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> All your silly codes and obscure literary references - can't save you. - Oh?
Sorry, Aunt Flis, I didn't mean to scare you.
It is a bit Gormenghast.<eos> Nonsense, Penelope.<eos> It's a fresh start.<eos> A chance to put the past behind you.<eos> Huh! There's no such thing.<eos> You never know who'll come crawling out of the woodwork.<eos> You were supposed to be here for lunch!<eos> I was unavoidably detained.<eos> In an all-night drinking den?<eos> I am warning you, Bobby, do NOT embarrass me!
Whatever it is you've got planned, you can forget it.<eos> This was your grandmother's.<eos> Seven carats and hideously ugly, so no doubt it will impress Norman Vanderlande.<eos> You've only got yourself to blame.<eos> Who was it who gambled and drank away a fortune and then rendered himself unmarriageable to any woman of breeding? !<eos> How can I forget, as you remind me so often?<eos> So you WILL behave.<eos> And propose to the girl.<eos> Or you will go down as the man that let this family go to ruin.<eos> Anything for you, dear Mother.
Of course, he'll have to go.<eos> There are plenty of places for the likes of him, but apart from that, I see no reason why the marriage can't go ahead.<eos> Isn't that rather up to your daughter?<eos> She'll do as she's told.<eos> I believe... you may be underestimating her, sir.<eos> Come on!<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> !<eos> That I would like to meet him.<eos> I've brought someone to see you.
Well, Vicky, because you're under the age of consent, the transplant will need to be approved by our ethicist.<eos> You okay?<eos> I get emotional when Erin's sick.<eos> - Of course. - Can we move this along, please?<eos> I will take you to Erin's room the minute they finish setting up her dialysis.<eos> Then we'll discuss the next steps.<eos> Okay.<eos> Charlie?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Um, I'd like to ask you as interim chief of surgeon...
No, I can't go into surgery without telling Jesse the truth.<eos> The truth about what?<eos> We'll give you two some space.<eos> Is your arm acting up?<eos> I can write a prescription when we get back.<eos> Dougie: Hey, can I get in on that action?<eos> You're fine with the saline, Doug.<eos> I'm always prepared.<eos> You know, chuckles, if you weren't such a good guy, I'd kick your ass for kidnapping me.<eos> You're mad at Alex. She's mad at you.
I-I-I'm so sorry, Dr. Storms.<eos> There was a little horse trading, and, clearly, the schedule's been affected.<eos> Get your act together, Williams.<eos> I'm handling it.<eos> I'm handling it.<eos> Well, Olivia came clean about her one-night stand, and Jesse walked out on her.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> But being honest was the right thing to do.<eos> We should scrub.<eos> Maybe for you, but... people deal with their issues in different ways.
Even after everything, you're still beside her, backing her up.<eos> Yep, I am.<eos> Honey Nut Shahirios, can I offer some advice?<eos> If things go south with your family, make sure your kid knows it's not their fault.<eos> Okay.<eos> Dougie?<eos> Well, I'll see you inside.<eos> Those two...<eos> You got a lot of good guys in your corner.<eos> I miss having you in my corner.
You haven't seen her sister around, have you? - No, why?<eos> - Because these girls are hanging by a thread.<eos> I've got one whose kidney is shot, and the other one's heart is failing her.<eos> And if they don't wake up soon, it's just...<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> I'll do what I can.<eos> Great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, you heard the nice lady doctor.<eos> Let's get you back inside your body, right?
I feel really light all of a sudden... like I'm floating for real.<eos> Am I floating?<eos> Shahir?<eos> What happened to the girl in O.R. 2?<eos> She had a hemorrhagic stroke.<eos> I couldn't restore the blood flow in time.<eos> I should inform the parents.<eos> I don't feel dead.<eos> I don't feel anything.<eos> Yeah, that's... that's because a ventilator is breathing for you.
Well, I-I can't exactly check my voicemail while I'm in the middle of a heart transplant, so you-you...<eos> No, no, you listen.<eos> My mom may not have been a saint, but she deserves to be remembered by the people that loved her in the beautiful garden terrace that I booked over a week ago.<eos> No, I... understand.<eos> Well... I'm an ass.<eos> You are.<eos> I've been stuck in a loop for... since we were kids.<eos> Missing Dad, blaming Mom.<eos> Resenting you for... rising above it all.<eos> Lexi, I'm not mad at you.
Both: What if we can't live up to the expectations?<eos> You know, today, we kind of fast-forwarded through a Shidduch.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's an Orthodox thing...<eos> It's when you go on a series of dates and you talk about big things like morals and values, and by the end of it, you know if you're compatible or not.<eos> I'm gonna say we didn't pass with flying colors.<eos> No, we did not.<eos> But it didn't make me want to be with you any less.<eos> Maggie, I don't want some epic, tortured love affair with you.<eos> I just want you.

I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin.<eos> But my pod got knocked off-course and by the time I got here, my cousin had already grown up and become Superman.<eos> I hid who I really was until one day when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.<eos> To most people I'm a reporter at Catco Worldwide Media.<eos> But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.<eos> I am Supergirl.<eos> Previously on Supergirl...<eos> You're not gonna go crazy on me, are you?<eos> Probably.<eos> I'm shutting you down. Roulette.
Previously on Supergirl...<eos> You're not gonna go crazy on me, are you?<eos> Probably.<eos> I'm shutting you down. Roulette.<eos> Guardian has been hailed as a hero.<eos> Yeah, I don't think the city should be putting its trust in him so quickly.<eos> What's wrong with us?<eos> Nothing.<eos> We're heroes, man.<eos> I'm training you. So that, one day, if you are so inclined you can make a difference.
Well, now who's gonna help us?<eos> We have to get it to work.<eos> Nobody knows we're here!<eos> That's why I told you to get my sister.<eos> You know what?<eos> It doesn't matter who's to blame.<eos> We just need to get back to Earth.<eos> Aliens brought those people to this planet, and we're gonna find out why and save them.<eos> Um, could you maybe just think about saving us for a second?<eos> No one told you to come here.
I'm sorry, you have to go.<eos> I'm sorry, I can't...<eos> Okay.<eos> Got it.<eos> See you, Danvers.<eos> Well, if this isn't deja vu.<eos> - Why are you here?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Wait, who is this?<eos> I'm here because of you.
Hey, thanks for the recharge.<eos> No, it was ? all this guy's idea.?<eos> I couldn't make the trip myself, so I thought I'd send a little sun along.<eos> - Welcome home, Supergirl.<eos> - Thanks, J'onn.<eos> Earth smells funny.<eos> Always smell like this?<eos> Oh, my baby.<eos> I'm so sorry, Mom.<eos> I should've listened to you.

You sure you heard someone?<eos> I mean, I hear the sound of rushing water, but I don't think anyone else is out here.<eos> Hessians.<eos> That's cool.<eos> Nate?<eos> The Hessians must've planned to camp here for the night.<eos> I'm so cold.<eos> I've never been so cold.<eos> - Why aren't you cold?<eos> - 'Cause I'm stronger than you.
The spear allows us to rewrite reality.<eos> Now, if you were to help me, your father no longer has to ship off to battle.<eos> He would no longer have to die in that ambush.<eos> Your mother would no longer be a widow, and you...<eos> The only way you're getting that spear is by prying it from my cold, dead hands.<eos> Well, that works too.<eos> When they change shifts, I'm gonna bust us out of here.<eos> Are you really so anxious to die?<eos> I argued for your life, Mr. Rory.<eos> That's why I'm taking you with me.
I've been a soldier since I was 20 years old, but our cause is the cause of all men:<eos> to be treated equally, regardless of hereditary privilege.<eos> We must prove to the world that you don't need a title to be a gentleman.<eos> The British may be dishonorable, but I am not.<eos> By my death, I will prove to the Crown what it means to be an American.<eos> You don't know the first thing about being an American.<eos> We're misfits, outcasts, and we're proud of it.<eos> If they attack in formation, we pop them off from the trees.<eos> If they challenge you to a duel, you raid their camp at night.<eos> And if they're gonna hang you, you fight dirty and you never, ever give up.
We have a job to do.<eos> Okay, please don't let this kill me.<eos> You managed to turn on the auxiliary power,<eos> Mr. Jackson. Well done.<eos> Hey, come on, man.<eos> You're Captain Rip Hunter.<eos> The man who recruited a bunch of reject super heroes to not save his family?<eos> Don't tell me you miss that self-righteous idiot.<eos> This isn't you.<eos> Whatever the Legion's done to turn you into their puppet, you...
Rats.<eos> You're a good man, Rip.<eos> Even when you disappeared, we carried on because that's what you wanted.<eos> No, because the old Rip was a fool for believing that time is worth saving, and you were even bigger fools for believing him.<eos> Now, my patience is wearing thin.<eos> Where's the spear fragment?<eos> In the same place you left it.<eos> I think I'll let you do the honors.<eos> You.<eos> I underestimated you, Jax.
Kaboom.<eos> Take them down!<eos> All right.<eos> Come on, Georgie boy.<eos> If you're expecting me to blink, it's gonna be a long day.<eos> A gentleman would stay and fight, but as an American, I suggest we run.<eos> Don't move!<eos> You haven't got it in you.<eos> You didn't have to kill her.<eos> Sara wasn't supposed to die, not like that, not by you.
Shut up!<eos> He's with the Legion now.<eos> The Rip we know is gone.<eos> You know what day it is, Jax?<eos> It's December 25th.<eos> It's Christmas.<eos> It's when we remember to be our best selves.<eos> Why are you protecting him?<eos> I'm not protecting him.<eos> I'm protecting you.
Copy that.<eos> Have either of you gentlemen heard of the Spear of Destiny?<eos> The Spear allegedly has the power to rewrite reality.<eos> I know that you're one of the protectors of the Spear of Destiny, and I know that you know where the other pieces are hidden.<eos> Oh... okay, okay.<eos> The piece of the Spear's inside your telescope.<eos> Will you put the gun down, Jax?<eos> He's with the Legion now.<eos> Why are you protecting him?<eos> I'm protecting you.
They have a certain smell.<eos> I thought that was just because you didn't bathe.<eos> What'd you steal?<eos> How dare you even suggest...<eos> What did you steal?<eos> Dr. Mid-Nite wouldn't be needing it, so I figured I'd...<eos> I couldn't resist.<eos> Though I prefer the term "borrowed."<eos> Impressive.<eos> There's hope for you yet.
Ray.<eos> Oh, come on, buddy, open your eyes, you stupid bastard.<eos> Ray, come on!<eos> Ray!<eos> Stop yelling at me.<eos> Ray, you brilliant bastard.<eos> It's not Ray anymore.<eos> It's Sir Raymond of the Palms.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm never gonna call you that, buddy.
Maybe legend and history aren't so different after all.<eos> Maybe they're just stories to remind us where we come from and who we can become.<eos> So what do you say?<eos> You wanna find out how you're gonna be remembered in everyone's favorite bedtime story?<eos> Nah.<eos> I think I'd rather make up my future as I go.<eos> Nice.<eos> I got something I wanna say to you.<eos> Well, I'm a captive audience, aren't I?<eos> I was gonna kill you for what you did to Sara, but she stopped me, and I'm glad.

- Stay calm.<eos> - Oh, my God, get it off.<eos> Kick it, kill it, kill it!<eos> Get it!<eos> That was gross.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You're afraid of snakes.<eos> And you're not?<eos> Animals only lash out if they're provoked or desperate.<eos> Your slithery friend wasn't trying to hurt you.
Then there's more than just bizarro me on this ship.<eos> Like Evil Ray, Evil Stein. Evil Mick.<eos> I guess that's just regular Mick, but still.<eos> All right, let's find Rip, get what we need,<eos> - and get out of here. - Yeah.<eos> I think... I think we ditched her.<eos> Okay, quick question, Ray.<eos> Your lady dinosaur friend, you said she recognized your scent.<eos> Wait, I believe her name was Gertrude.<eos> Right, I couldn't help but get the feeling that Gertrude didn't like you very much.
We've got plenty of extra room in the brig.<eos> This is all in Rip's mind.<eos> None of this is real.<eos> You're not real.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Does that feel real?<eos> Rip.<eos> Get away from me!<eos> Look, relax, it's okay.<eos> I'm gonna get you out of here.
Rip?<eos> That really you?<eos> I don't know who I am anymore, Mr. Jackson.<eos> What I do know is that we've got to get out of here.<eos> What's going on?<eos> This place only existed because Rip believed it did, and now that he's seen the truth...<eos> You have to leave.<eos> Thank you, thank you for believing in me even when I didn't.<eos> - You have to go.<eos> - Well, I can't just leave you.
But what about the captain?<eos> You... you were with me all of these days in this prison.<eos> You were what saw me through, just as you have guided me to safety through all our years on the ship.<eos> That is my purpose, Captain.<eos> Yeah, but if this place isn't real, then does that mean that you don't exist either?<eos> Not in this form, no.<eos> But unless you let me go...<eos> you won't exist either.<eos> Not in any way that matters.<eos> No. I can't leave you, Gideon.
It wasn't you.<eos> This is you.<eos> Dr. Palmer and Mr. Jackson have finished making repairs.<eos> We are ready to time-jump, Captain.<eos> Thank you, Gideon.<eos> - I'll see you on the bridge. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Gideon.<eos> - Yes, Captain?<eos> I'm, uh...<eos> I'm really sorry for everything I put you through.

- Oh! - Hey, careful.<eos> - I'm okay. Yeah?<eos> - Uh...<eos> Mon-El?<eos> Mistakes were made.<eos> But it's our fewest cardboard fatalities yet.<eos> - I think you're ready. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> I mean, you're dedicated.<eos> You punch really hard.<eos> Not as hard as you.
The workload.<eos> The lying to Kara.<eos> It's gotta stop.<eos> Winn, you know what she's gonna say.<eos> Maybe she's gonna be totally cool about all this, all right?<eos> You guys have worked together before.<eos> She totally respects what you do.<eos> Maybe she'll be grateful for the help.<eos> You don't know.<eos> Seriously, this is officially the first time I have ever asked you for something.
Sorry.<eos> How did this happen?<eos> Looks like an inmate named Lisa Gold and a thug disguised as a guard helped her out.<eos> Or she kidnapped them.<eos> Look, until we know for sure what happened, let's just stick to the facts.<eos> This was very well staged and very well thought out.<eos> And we know Livewire is not one for thoughts.<eos> Yeah, she's mostly "kill this, electrocute that."<eos> She's probably already killed that inmate and guard.<eos> Kara, I know Livewire's a sore spot for you, but just get a grip.
All of the human parts of her are gone.<eos> She should have been here, where we could make sure that she didn't get out!<eos> Uh, what is that?<eos> No, it's expensive.<eos> We've got this.<eos> You've already defeated her twice.<eos> What's the big deal?<eos> The deal is that she brings death and destruction.<eos> J'onn?<eos> Need you for a minute.
He's just not a hero.<eos> Why do you get to decide that?<eos> Never mind.<eos> Just...<eos> Forget it.<eos> I, um...<eos> Sorry.<eos> What did...<eos> What did you want to tell me?<eos> I came in here and bulldozed you.
Sorry.<eos> Um, Kara...<eos> This is between us.<eos> - Not them.<eos> - Yeah, you're right.<eos> Can we have a minute, please?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh, yes, yes.<eos> I am calm.<eos> I am going to listen to you.
There was a cop that took a lightning bolt because "Mon-El's still learning."<eos> He cares about himself, he cares about you, and that's what he fights for.<eos> But he can change.<eos> You can't.<eos> You are never going to be strong enough for this.<eos> You don't get to decide who is a hero.<eos> And who are you to tell me how to be?<eos> Or who to be.<eos> I am meant for this.<eos> If you don't stop, I'll stop you.
If you don't stop, I'll stop you.<eos> You're welcome to try.<eos> Do you want to know how she's doing?<eos> I know.<eos> I always know.<eos> She could be halfway across the city and I would...<eos> Feel her.<eos> The final cruelty of our war that I should still feel tied to those creatures.<eos> When I needed her, when you needed her,<eos> she opened up a vein for you.
If I find that there was some good in their kind, I don't hate her.<eos> Forgiveness isn't something that you give to somebody who's hurt you.<eos> Forgiveness is something you give to yourself.<eos> Hey... Hey, wait.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Yeah, what's wrong?<eos> I can't trust you.<eos> - Me?<eos> - You were reckless.<eos> You left your post and because of you, someone got hurt.
Forgiveness isn't something that you give to somebody who's hurt you.<eos> Forgiveness is something you give to yourself.<eos> Hey... Hey, wait.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Yeah, what's wrong?<eos> I can't trust you.<eos> - Me?<eos> - You were reckless.<eos> You left your post and because of you, someone got hurt.<eos> I was trying to protect you.
Do you like me?<eos> Do I like...<eos> Uh, at the moment, that's a tough call.<eos> You kissed me when you were sick.<eos> Yeah, um, says you.<eos> Are you working with me because you like me?<eos> I don't know what to tell you, okay?<eos> I want to work with you, Kara!<eos> And that is it!<eos> I'm sorry if that disappoints you.
Guardian for the win.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - It won't be long now.<eos> We're not saying goodbye.<eos> I'm bringing her back.<eos> I have to try the Bond.<eos> It's the right thing to do.<eos> I've, uh, never attempted this with a White Martian.<eos> I don't know what'll happen.<eos> If things get hairy, I'm gonna pull you out.
Stay with me.<eos> Both of you.<eos> - We're not leaving.<eos> - We're here, J'onn.<eos> All right.<eos> M'gann?<eos> This is where it happens.<eos> What is happening to you?<eos> Run, Green.<eos> They'll kill you if they find you here.
M'gann, it's J'onn.<eos> This is a memory.<eos> We are in no danger here.<eos> I set the fire.<eos> I killed the other guards.<eos> They'll find me.<eos> They'll kill me.<eos> That's all right.<eos> I deserve it.<eos> But they can't find you.
You save me, too<eos> I... I hid who I was.<eos> I said I was a Green.<eos> I wanted...<eos> Tell me.<eos> To be your friend.<eos> I couldn't bring your people back to life, but I could make you feel less alone.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm here with you.<eos> I see you.
You could have the real deal.<eos> I don't think you understand your purpose here.<eos> See, after seeing news footage of the attack, every military on Earth is gonna want my super soldiers.<eos> That's why I staged the attack on the police station,<eos> I knew Supergirl couldn't resist it.<eos> And she gave me a two-for-one deal.<eos> Showed everyone that my super soldiers could take the cops and Supergirl using just their electricity.<eos> My electricity.<eos> This is copyright infringement, asshat.<eos> I'm gonna sue you, and then,

That's enough!<eos> Come on!<eos> Stop!<eos> You two, go get them, I'll save Livewire.<eos> Got it.<eos> This might hurt a little.<eos> It's nice of you.<eos> Stupid, but nice.<eos> You're not looking so hot, blondie.<eos> I'll warm you up.

I'll make you a deal, all-American Barbie.<eos> You can haul his ass to prison, but I never see the inside of a cell again.<eos> I can't make that deal.<eos> - Then he fries.<eos> - No, Leslie, don't!<eos> My name is Livewire!<eos> Livewire, listen to me!<eos> Why?<eos> You know you can't stop me from leaving.<eos> And you know you can't stop me from chasing after you.
I think we're gonna sit.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> I remember.<eos> I was sick and alone.<eos> And you were leaning over me.<eos> And you must have been sad.<eos> Or something because your eyes were insanely blue.<eos> I mean, they always are.<eos> But they were like comets.<eos> And I had never seen anyone so stunning, and I kissed you,

Kara, you all right?<eos> Can I get you anything to drink?<eos> Just get me something strong.<eos> Actually, you know what, I'll have what he's having.<eos> Oh, he's been drinking exclusively club soda for the last week.<eos> Really?<eos> I'll just stick with my club soda then.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I know you're there.<eos> I saw you yesterday, too.
For protection.<eos> It's not here for J'onn.<eos> It's here for me.<eos> Hunting me.<eos> The White Martians want me to pay for my war crimes.<eos> They're telling me.<eos> - Psychically.<eos> - Then you have to remain here.<eos> If you go outside, you're vulnerable.<eos> I can't put you all in danger.
M'gann.<eos> You're making a big mistake.<eos> Risking yourself helps no one.<eos> This is my fight, J'onn.<eos> You're cut off after this one.<eos> Armek.<eos> Don't call me that.<eos> Would you prefer it in the human tongue, wife?<eos> I am no longer bonded to you.<eos> The nest has been cold these 300 years without you.
Would you prefer it in the human tongue, wife?<eos> I am no longer bonded to you.<eos> The nest has been cold these 300 years without you.<eos> It was always cold.<eos> You've been impersonating a Green.<eos> How do you live with yourself?<eos> I thought you were dead, and I suppose it gave me some comfort.<eos> Your parting gift.<eos> No, you didn't kill me, but you came closer than anyone ever will.<eos> I've come to bring you back to Mars, k'onahr.
With the eradication of the vermin,<eos> Mars is a paradise.<eos> The way it was intended to be.<eos> The Greens have been silenced.<eos> The ones who thought they were better than us.<eos> We are now one pure hive.<eos> So, who are you going to kill next?<eos> What other species deserves to be obliterated because you decide you're better than them?<eos> Whichever one we choose.<eos> I'm not afraid of you.
If you ever cared for me, you'll leave them alone.<eos> I'm going to make this very simple.<eos> You have two hours to turn yourself over to me.<eos> If you do, I may let them live.<eos> If you don't...<eos> Let's just say, I'm glad you made friends here on Earth, M'gann.<eos> It will be such a pleasure to watch them burn.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> They'll just find you again.
It's taken me hundreds of years to learn to trust again after...<eos> After what my people did.<eos> You are not your people.<eos> Okay?<eos> You are kind and you are generous and willing to put yourself before others.<eos> You are different.<eos> I know that now.<eos> Then you know that I can't just stay here and let these monsters hurt you and your friends.<eos> They're not just my friends, they're your friends, too.<eos> And they want to protect you.
No.<eos> I'm just distracted.<eos> So, now...<eos> I'll forget about it for the rest of the evening.<eos> I promise.<eos> You know, the days of you pushing down your feelings are officially over.<eos> So go.<eos> Go talk to your sister.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah. I'll meet you there.
Shouldn't you be at your concert?<eos> Ah, well, I wanted to check in.<eos> I was just going to get an update, but I don't think we've found anything yet.<eos> No.<eos> I mean I wanted to check in about us.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry I bailed on your Earth birthday.<eos> You made all those plans.<eos> I made them this morning, it's not a big deal.<eos> This morning?<eos> - So last-minute of you.
- Absolutely.<eos> You find out anything else?<eos> All is clear on the Martian front.<eos> We were about to game plan some new tracking techniques.<eos> M'gann.<eos> You're here.<eos> I want to help in any way that I can.<eos> I hate them even more than you do.<eos> It's very brave of you to come.<eos> We'll do everything we can to keep you safe.
Like what's the scented candle that I hate?<eos> - Teak wood and tobacco.<eos> - No. They can read minds, too.<eos> They know all your preferences, everything that makes you who you are.<eos> - What are you looking at?<eos> - What?<eos> - All right. Hey! - Whoa, whoa!<eos> - Holster your sidearms!<eos> - Yes, do that, please.<eos> - I wasn't looking at you.
It's a good thing.<eos> It's just...<eos> Ever since I've been on Earth, I don't know what life is like, without you there all the time.<eos> And I felt that changing and it's just...<eos> Scary.<eos> When my parents put me on that pod in Krypton, I...<eos> I don't think I realized what was actually happening.<eos> I didn't know that I was saying goodbye to them forever.<eos> I've been abandoned before, and I didn't wanna be abandoned again.<eos> I will never abandon you.
huge hole in my heart for so long now.<eos> I never thought...<eos> Dreamed that anybody would be able to fill it.<eos> When I realized you were a White Martian,<eos> I never thought that that person would be...<eos> You.<eos> But I was wrong.<eos> Your spirit is so beautiful and brave.<eos> Now that I'm able to see that,<eos> I can't imagine my life without you.

You did a great job with the de-Martianing.<eos> Uh, I'm going to go see James.<eos> See if he needs my help tonight.<eos> Unless you object?<eos> No.<eos> Just...<eos> Be safe.<eos> Always.<eos> Thank you for saving me.<eos> I should be thanking you.
Though I had a mother, she wasn't warm, that's not our way, but she cared for me.<eos> I know she did.<eos> And I'd forgotten that feeling until now...<eos> What it feels like to have a family.<eos> Which is what makes this so hard.<eos> I'm going back to Mars.<eos> Why?<eos> There must be other voices like mine.<eos> White Martians who have the desire and the capacity to change, who don't want to be defined by the hatred of our kind, but just need a push to do the right thing.<eos> They could kill you as soon as you land.

I'm so happy for you.
Look, there's a "K."<eos> Go ahead. Blow it out.<eos> Gently!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Was Maggie mad that you missed the concert?<eos> Well, luckily, I have a girlfriend that understands when deadly aliens besiege my place of work, that takes precedence.<eos> Yeah, I'm glad everyone is okay.<eos> That last White Martian... Oof!<eos> First of all, boy, did it do a good impression of you, and second, you got there just in time.
When I was a child, my planet Krypton was dying.<eos> I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin.<eos> But my pod got knocked off-course and by the time I got here, my cousin had already grown up and become Superman.<eos> I hid who I really was until one day when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.<eos> To most people, I'm a reporter at CatCo Worldwide Media.<eos> But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.<eos> I am Supergirl.<eos> Previously on Supergirl...<eos> We salvaged you and resurrected you.
The trial of Lillian Luthor continued today.<eos> Luthor, the suspected head of the anti-alien terrorist organization, Cadmus, has been charged with a host of crimes, including the use of a bio-weapon in an attempted extermination of all aliens in National City.<eos> That woman is bad news.<eos> Luthor claims that she is a victim...<eos> I hope once she's convicted, they, uh... They put her out on the town square for public shaming.<eos> On Daxam, it really seemed to cut back on recidivism.<eos> Uh, well, that kind of punishment actually went away a long time ago.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> Yeah, I haven't, uh...<eos> Haven't seen you in a while.
It's just the first time I've been in this bar since, uh...<eos> Hey, I'm... I am very excited to meet Alex's new mystery man.<eos> Hey, do we know what, um, what he does for a living?<eos> Alex's guy?<eos> Cop. - Oh!<eos> - Yeah, no way Alex Danvers dates someone who doesn't own a firearm.<eos> Hey, you guys.<eos> Hey, um... You all remember Maggie, right?<eos> Hey, yeah.<eos> Good to see you again.
Hey, um... You all remember Maggie, right?<eos> Hey, yeah.<eos> Good to see you again.<eos> Alex! I...<eos> I didn't know.<eos> - Did you know?<eos> - Yes, I knew, I'm psychic.<eos> How come you never said anything before?<eos> It's not for me to say.<eos> Good for you, Alex.
She could probably use a friend.<eos> Using her friends, that's exactly what I'm worried about.<eos> Whoa! Whoa, buddy, come on.<eos> Sorry!<eos> Lillian Luthor's defense attorneys tried to downplay Lena Luthor's testimony, characterizing her statements as<eos> "the angry rant of an estranged daughter."<eos> Everyone in National City has got an opinion about me.<eos> Ungrateful daughter, heroine, bitch.<eos> Ugh. And they've all called for a quote.<eos> Not you though, Snapper Carr hasn't sent you here to shake me down.
Measured, succinct, believable.<eos> The jury ate it up.<eos> I can just call the guard back and go.<eos> No.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I promised myself I would be better.<eos> Please sit.<eos> Old habits die hard.<eos> I don't want to fight.<eos> I asked you here because I wanted to let you know that I forgive you.

Told me the truth about what?<eos> When your father and I first got together, it was the happiest time of my life.<eos> But after Lex was born, Lionel started having... an affair.<eos> I was clueless, until I went to surprise him on a business trip, only to find that he was with your mother.<eos> My mother?<eos> She was already pregnant with you by then.<eos> They paid her off.<eos> Your father came back to try and rebuild our marriage.<eos> Then when you were four, we heard your mother had died.<eos> The state was going to put you in foster care.

Your father brought you home and we adopted you.<eos> But he didn't like me spending time with you.<eos> I think it made him remember what he'd done.<eos> He felt guilty.<eos> He'd lash out.<eos> So, I stayed away.<eos> Gravitated to Lex.<eos> To protect myself.<eos> And you.<eos> But seeing you with him...
- It is not enough! Lillian Luthor is not a criminal.<eos> She wanted to save you.<eos> This trial is a conspiracy to condemn the one person who wants to save your lives.<eos> Your children's lives!<eos> Order.<eos> Settle down. We must have order in the courtroom.<eos> Counselor.<eos> Get control over your witness. Mr. Corben has become antagonistic and clearly is not willing to answer the questions as directed.<eos> Permission to treat the witness as hostile, Your Honor.<eos> Allow me to treat you as hostile.
But once it's out there, it's out there. I mean, people still think Macaulay Culkin's dead.<eos> James, come on, you know we can't print this.<eos> I can't believe I'm saying this, but I agree with Snapper.<eos> And I think you should, too.<eos> Kara.<eos> Kara, come on, wait.<eos> No, no, are you kidding me?<eos> The only thing Lena has done is help.<eos> She called the police on her own mother over the Medusa virus.<eos> That's exactly my point. If she can betray her own mother, what is to stop her from pulling a long con on you?
For years.<eos> And Clark believed in Lex for the longest time.<eos> No matter what people said, no matter what kind of proof he saw with his own eyes.<eos> No, Lex was his friend.<eos> - But Clark was wrong.<eos> - Lena is not Lex. But they grew up in the same house, Kara.<eos> I don't understand why you keep defending her.<eos> And you have so much faith in her, but none in me, as Guardian.<eos> That's entirely different.<eos> I am trying to protect you.
Are you going to tell me not to believe in her?<eos> You believe in a lot of people that others don't.<eos> Oh, did you talk to James?<eos> No, I'm actually talking about myself.<eos> You know, you believing in me, it meant a lot.<eos> You're right.<eos> I have been cold. - And distant.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. And I'd like to apologize for that.<eos> Hey, I'm just glad to know that it's not me adjusting to Earth's chilly climate.<eos> I was mad at you, because I thought you were dating Eve.
You literally just said you were mad.<eos> No. Two seconds ago, you said, "I am mad about"...<eos> Yeah, I'm surprised.<eos> - Oh, not mad, surprised.<eos> - I'm surprised that... You'd just date someone else, when you were serious about me, because I mean if...<eos> How could you be serious if you did that?<eos> If you don't like me, why do you...<eos> I'm gonna go check and see if they've found Lena.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Don't. You're still angry I had Metallo liberate you from that jail?
I'm going back!<eos> To what? You have no life anymore, Lena.<eos> You have no one on your side.<eos> You're guilty, just like me.<eos> You're on the run, just like me.<eos> Join Cadmus.<eos> And together we can do all the great things you ever dreamed of.<eos> And with no Luthor men to divide us,<eos> I can finally be the mother you always wanted.<eos> Because I do love you.
It's a biometric lock.<eos> It scans for Luthor DNA.<eos> Tell me you don't have a bit of Lex frozen somewhere.<eos> I didn't say Lex's DNA.<eos> I said Luthor.<eos> Any Luthor can open it.<eos> And you, my daughter, are part of that family tree.<eos> You didn't have your green goon liberate me from prison because you loved me.<eos> Because you wanted to help me.<eos> You did it because I'm the only one who can open this vault for you.

- They're in pieces, I have to rebuild...<eos> - No, there's no time.<eos> I have to go now, or Lena's dead.<eos> Kara, we calculated the rate of radioactive decay.<eos> - It's faster than we thought.<eos> - How fast? Minutes.<eos> I mean, its half-life is decreasing exponentially.<eos> Kara, you have to turn back.<eos> When the Kryptonite explodes, it's gonna send out a radioactive cloud of Kryptonite gas.<eos> If you are anywhere near it, it'll kill you.
Everything we need to rid this planet of Kryptonians and every other alien invader, once and for all.<eos> You're worse than Lex.<eos> I promise you, I will be on the right side of history.<eos> Maybe then you'll believe that I was looking out for your best interests, after all.<eos> Whether you like it or not, I'll always be your mother.<eos> Oh, my beautiful boy.<eos> I had no idea...<eos> You finished it.<eos> Supergirl, I can't believe you're here.<eos> Kara Danvers believes in you.
- You flatter me. - I only wrote the truth.<eos> I'm learning to keep digging even when all the evidence points one way.<eos> There's always another side. Even when it's hard to find.<eos> Especially when it's hard to find.<eos> So, my office is overflowing with flowers.<eos> - Really? - Yeah.<eos> You didn't have to do that.<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> Supergirl told me that it was you who sent her.<eos> I don't know how to thank you.
More like, you're an arrogant dude-bro and I'm the personification of the American way.<eos> I'm sorry, and I'm arrogant?<eos> That's not the point.<eos> It's just...<eos> Last year I thought I could have it all, and then I thought I couldn't.<eos> Then I had to pick.<eos> So, I chose being Supergirl over having a relationship.<eos> And then, you came along,<eos> and I thought you were... thoughtless and selfish.<eos> And I kept writing you off.
And I kept writing you off.<eos> And you kept proving me wrong.<eos> And I just got me thinking...<eos> Maybe I can have it all.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Darling!<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> My name is Mr. Mxyzptlk.<eos> And Kara Zor-El, I love you.
To most people, I'm a reporter at CatCo Worldwide Media.<eos> But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.<eos> I am Supergirl.<eos> Previously on Supergirl...<eos> I'm going back to Mars.<eos> Goodbye, J'onn.<eos> Goodbye, Miss Martian.<eos> And I just got me thinking... Maybe I can have it all.<eos> Darling!<eos> Kara Zor-El, I love you.
First, let's set the mood!<eos> Candles!<eos> Who are you?<eos> Then, music!<eos> - What the hell?<eos> - Next, flowers!<eos> And for the piece de resistance... The ring!<eos> Kara, sweetie, it's like I said.<eos> I'm your one true love, your soulmate, your one true pairing as the kids say.<eos> My name is Mxyzptlk and I love you, Kara Zor-El.

Will you marry me?<eos> Hey. I don't know how you got to this planet,<eos> - but she's with me.<eos> - The other suitor!<eos> I didn't see you there, tall, dark and bland-some.
I'm just enthusiastic to finally be here with you.<eos> How do you even know who I am?<eos> I watched you cross the dimensions.<eos> An eternity of lovelessness.<eos> There's no one like you where I'm from, Kara.<eos> No woman as strong, or independent, or as beautiful, or as brave, or as bold...<eos> Okay.<eos> Look.<eos> I'm flattered.<eos> But I'm not going to marry you, Mxyzptlk.

Don't be sorry, buttercup, I know what you're doing.<eos> You're playing hard to get, which is utterly charming and delightful, by the way.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not...<eos> You're flustered, confused, your heart is racing?<eos> I have that effect on women.<eos> Let me tell you how this works.<eos> I chose you as my mate, and now I will wow you with breathtaking feats of ardor until you fall madly in love with me.
We're ready to send your message to Mars whenever you are.<eos> What message?<eos> On Earth it's customary to send messages on Valentine's Day.<eos> We had a similar custom on Mars.<eos> It's too bad you can't call her.<eos> We Martians are a psychic people.<eos> All our communication was through thought.<eos> But when we had something really important to say, we would often write it down.<eos> On some planets, to write something is to truly say it.<eos> I'm sure M'gann will be very happy to hear from you.
- Maybe we should talk in private...<eos> - Okay, private.<eos> This is good.<eos> So, you and me...<eos> There was something happening between us before. Mxyzptlk showed up.<eos> And I really, really want to get back to that.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Me, too...<eos> - But first, I have to get rid of him.<eos> I mean, of all the girls in all the galaxies, that the little imp had to pick you
That is a very, very valid point.<eos> So why don't I buy you gentlemen something... Something stronger, right?<eos> Can I?<eos> Put the human down.<eos> I hate bullies.<eos> Yeah, yeah. I do too.<eos> Thank you for bailing me out.<eos> Not that I needed it because I totally had those guys.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That guy probably would've choked to death on your bones as he ate you.
- On Daxam, we crush them.<eos> - What?<eos> No.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> We learned the hard way that the only way to deal with them was to kill them quickly.<eos> - Let me... Let me take care of him.<eos> - No!<eos> No.<eos> We don't kill.<eos> I'm not going to let some imp stalk you and live.
I was helping her so...<eos> You?<eos> That's a laugh.<eos> You're lucky I flew in when I did, Supergirl.<eos> I mean, do you think this fraud could have helped you save the day?<eos> What superpower?<eos> I guess he could have leaped over Parasite like a gazelle.<eos> Hey, that's...<eos> Would you like to see my superpower?<eos> 'Cause I will just rip you apart with my bare hands right here
Spoken like a true Daxamite.<eos> You're nothing but a thug.<eos> I mean, this goddess, she requires a man who's equal in her powers and wits.<eos> Who can come to her aid when villains suddenly pop up.<eos> Wait...<eos> Parasite...<eos> This was all you?<eos> Don't you...<eos> Don't you see what he's doing here?<eos> He's creating havoc so that he can play the hero and then impress you.
Finally, darling, we're alone.<eos> What is it going to take to get you off this planet?<eos> It's like I said.<eos> It's going to take two little words.<eos> "I do."<eos> Or things will get very bad for your world.<eos> Hey. I cannot believe you sided with that fast-talking, nefarious twerp.<eos> I did not side with him.<eos> You sent me away so you could have private time with your stalker!<eos> I sent him away so that he didn't snap you off to Siberia, and plus, you were being out of control!
- You know what, Kara?<eos> I knew you that you were a little full of yourself, like, a little bit.<eos> - Full of myself?<eos> - But this is off the charts...<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I'm not jealous.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm angry, because you have an unfair double standard.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're right, I don't hold you and Mxy to the same standard, because I expect bad behavior from him, but from you,
Okay?<eos> I'm angry, because you have an unfair double standard.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're right, I don't hold you and Mxy to the same standard, because I expect bad behavior from him, but from you,<eos> - No, no, no...<eos> - What?<eos> !<eos> You do not get to turn this around on me.<eos> Because I'm the one in this situation, at this moment...<eos> Good to see you, Dana.
They throw themselves at you left and right.<eos> Yeah. Not all of them.<eos> Come on, hit me.<eos> I need, like, a relationship pearl.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Yeah...<eos> Things were a lot easier on Daxam, when I objectified women and didn't care about anyone.<eos> - So...<eos> - Okay.<eos> I feel you.
She gave that card to her parents.<eos> And then they called my parents.<eos> And that's how I was outed.<eos> And then my dad kicked me out, and I had to live with an aunt for three years.<eos> - Maggie, I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - Yeah, whatever.<eos> But I don't understand.<eos> Why didn't you just tell me the truth?<eos> I didn't want to scare you. Okay?
Hey, hey!<eos> I'm so sorry. Sorry I'm late.<eos> - Better have a good reason.<eos> I just got us reservations at Saxon's, which, on Valentine's Day, is, like, harder than getting a Hellgrammite to eat leafy greens, so...<eos> So we are set for 8:00.<eos> And you can tell me about Starhaven, and I'll tell you about growing up in Newark.<eos> And then I thought we'd get a nightcap.<eos> You know, just talk some more.<eos> I just feel like... when dating, it's better to get to know each other...<eos> I want you.
I'm a God and you're a loser!<eos> - You're a dead man.<eos> - Strike that. Reverse it.<eos> I hear you're allergic to lead.<eos> Stop!<eos> - Kara.<eos> - Sweetheart.<eos> This volatile maniac tried to kill me!<eos> It'll be better for all of us once I snuff him out.<eos> I'll marry you!
Okay?<eos> You're right.<eos> You're right, okay?<eos> I'm jealous.<eos> I wish I could snap my fingers and give you anything you wish for, and it kills me that he can do that stuff for you and I can't.<eos> And I acted badly, okay?<eos> Very badly.<eos> But please...<eos> Please do not marry him.<eos> I will be better for you...
And I acted badly, okay?<eos> Very badly.<eos> But please...<eos> Please do not marry him.<eos> I will be better for you...<eos> It's not just the jealousy thing, monel.<eos> It's the patronizing ego thing.<eos> I told you I could handle Mxy, and you didn't listen.<eos> I swear to Rao, I will listen, Kara.<eos> I will respect you, just please, just give me another chance...

It's time!<eos> Kara!<eos> You said noon and here I am!<eos> - Kara!<eos> - I can hear you.<eos> Where's the dress?<eos> The flowers?<eos> The pigs in blankets?<eos> See, that's the thing, Mxy.<eos> I'm not going to marry you.

And you reject it all?<eos> I could have made you a god, like me.<eos> I don't want to be a god, Mxy.<eos> I just want you off of Earth.<eos> You don't get to tell me what to do until after we're married!<eos> Sorry, Uncle Jor-El.<eos> You think this is the worst it can get?<eos> One snap and I'll crack your world in half.<eos> Then where will you go, Kryptonian?<eos> I will hound you across the stars, Kara, until you admit that you love me.

I'll do anything.<eos> Just don't die.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm not going to tell you the cancellation code.<eos> So there's a code?<eos> I can't read this.<eos> Atomic Cauldron detonation in 30 seconds.<eos> I don't have time to learn your stupid moon language!<eos> Please, Supergirl.<eos> I'm literally begging you.
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Everyone is staring at me.<eos> Let them stare.<eos> You...<eos> I mean, you look just beautiful.<eos> - I didn't think you'd call.<eos> - Why?<eos> Last night was, like, beyond amazing on just so many levels.<eos> I figured it was a one-time thing for you.
Maggie?<eos> Wow, you're breathtaking.<eos> Maggie, what is all this?<eos> It's your belated Valentine's Day prom.<eos> May I?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> So sorry.<eos> I was too busy nursing my old wounds, and I forgot to look at the gorgeous woman in front of me, and consider her feelings.<eos> You deserved all of this as a girl, the pomp and the fuss.<eos> And you deserve an amazing romance with the woman who's absolutely crazy about you.
Anyway, I'm really glad you're okay.<eos> And I'm really, really happy that you didn't marry that guy.<eos> Me too.<eos> Anyway...<eos> I'll get...<eos> I'll get out of your hair.<eos> Wait.<eos> Don't go yet.<eos> Please.<eos> I get that you were upset that I wasn't listening to you and I...
And I'm really, really happy that you didn't marry that guy.<eos> Me too.<eos> Anyway...<eos> I'll get...<eos> I'll get out of your hair.<eos> Wait.<eos> Don't go yet.<eos> Please.<eos> I get that you were upset that I wasn't listening to you and I...<eos> I tried really, really, really hard to listen to you this time.
Wait.<eos> Don't go yet.<eos> Please.<eos> I get that you were upset that I wasn't listening to you and I...<eos> I tried really, really, really hard to listen to you this time.<eos> And I heard that you...<eos> You don't think that we belong together, and I respected that.<eos> No, but Mxy wasn't the only one I tricked.<eos> I didn't mean it.<eos> I just said it so you'd let me go to protect you.
We just walked in.<eos> It was 10 seconds.<eos> very, very short.<eos> I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself.<eos> I mean, back on Daxam, they used to throw parties when people got together.<eos> You're lucky I didn't arrange a parade.<eos> - Ha ha! - I'm just saying.<eos> Can we just pretend like that never happened?<eos> I'd like nothing more.<eos> But unfortunately, as your supervisor, I have to ask you to report to HR.
They told me but I didn't believe it.<eos> Alex.<eos> My Alex. Ow.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't know how long we were rotting out there in the Amazon, but...<eos> I came to at Cadmus.<eos> They saved me, so I could save Henshaw.<eos> They forced me to keep him alive, to enhance him.<eos> Physically turn him into the monster he was beneath.<eos> It is strange seeing you in Henshaw's skin.
-Hey.<eos> I heard there was a party.<eos> -Come on in.<eos> Hey, um...<eos> Come in.<eos> - Hey, sweetie. - Um...<eos> Dad, this is my girlfriend, Maggie.<eos> Things have changed.<eos> There is no man on Earth good enough for Alex Danvers.<eos> So it would have to be someone like you.
Thank you, Lizzie.<eos> I'm so sorry...<eos> That I wasn't here.<eos> It's going to be different now.<eos> We can make up for lost time.<eos> No.<eos> It's not possible.<eos> That time, it's gone.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean that I love you and I have missed you every day.
Why is no one questioning this?<eos> Is that not crazy?<eos> If your father walked through that door right now, after all these years that you thought he was dead, what would you do?<eos> I would run.<eos> - Run?<eos> - Because he was not a good man.<eos> So...<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm sorry about that.<eos> But this is not about you and your suspicion, and your disrespect are out of line.
I'm sorry about that.<eos> But this is not about you and your suspicion, and your disrespect are out of line.<eos> And you need to leave my home.<eos> - Kara...<eos> - No.<eos> - That's the...<eos> - No, no!<eos> You've ignored what I need from moment one today.<eos> I asked for privacy and time and you ignored that.<eos> And I asked you to give Jeremiah the benefit of the doubt and you ignored that too. So I don't...
You've ignored what I need from moment one today.<eos> I asked for privacy and time and you ignored that.<eos> And I asked you to give Jeremiah the benefit of the doubt and you ignored that too. So I don't...<eos> Okay, okay, hey!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That is two strikes on me, okay, but let's just...<eos> Let's let it go...<eos> I am not baseball.<eos> And unless you learn that what I say counts, this isn't going to work.<eos> - Why don't I show you out?
Don't sell yourself short, J'onn.<eos> It's easy for the young to demand change.<eos> And you were open to it.<eos> You did your part.<eos> A lot of lives are going to be better because of you.<eos> What did I say?<eos> You were the first human to treat me as an equal.<eos> Knowing who I really was.<eos> I didn't think that I'd ever see you again, my friend.<eos> Don't tell the girls, but I'm happy to see you, too.
- I'm sorry, friend.<eos> I've changed.<eos> J'onn!<eos> Put him down!<eos> Don't move!<eos> We have to get back.<eos> Now!<eos> Let's move!<eos> What have you done?<eos> J'onn, please, stay down, I don't want to hurt you any more than I have.
Train.<eos> Go.<eos> Alex!<eos> Dad!<eos> Freeze!<eos> Look at me!<eos> Look at me!<eos> How could you?<eos> How could you?<eos> Would you believe me if I said I did it for you?
Look at me!<eos> How could you?<eos> How could you?<eos> Would you believe me if I said I did it for you?<eos> You betrayed everyone at the DEO.<eos> Your friends.<eos> Our family, everyone that I love.<eos> You did that for me?<eos> Family's complicated, honey.<eos> I'm bringing you in.
I've never met a human that was actually up for dating an alien.<eos> Well, now you have.<eos> Any idea what Jeremiah stole from us?<eos> It's not good.<eos> He took the national alien registry.<eos> What is it?<eos> Cadmus has the list of all the aliens in the country.<eos> How could you?<eos> You betrayed everyone.<eos> Would you believe me if I said I did it for you?
I won't reveal their name, but I can confirm it is a classified federal agency who reported the theft from their servers.<eos> So, you got your intel from a government black site.<eos> How long have you been involved with them?<eos> Well, that's a leading question, Mr. Carr.<eos> I never said I was involved with them.<eos> I'm not the story.<eos> Cadmus is.<eos> All right.<eos> Off the record.<eos> I won't reveal it came from you.
Lillian was going to kill them all.<eos> You are forcibly deporting them.<eos> I mean, some of them have escaped famine and poverty and genocide.<eos> At least this way, they have a chance.<eos> - It was all a lie.<eos> - No.<eos> No, everything you told me in the woods.<eos> You said that you were working for Cadmus for me.<eos> And I am.<eos> From the moment Cadmus took me prisoner they told me they were gonna kill you and Kara unless I did what they said.
Come on.<eos> Come on!<eos> Okay.<eos> And in breaking news, authorities have thwarted a terrorist plot to send registered aliens back into space.<eos> Alien families are being reunited.<eos> - It's a happy ending to what was...<eos> - Winn!<eos> - a harrowing series of events.<eos> - Oh, thank God, you're safe.<eos> Oh, I thought I lost you.
You weren't right, you were lucky.<eos> And next time you might not be.<eos> One wrong statistic about the stock market and suddenly we're in the Great Depression.<eos> One misattributed quote from a candidate and you put a fascist in the White House.<eos> The rules are there for a reason.<eos> To make sure you get the story right.<eos> That's not luck.<eos> That's being a good reporter.<eos> You know what the worst part is?<eos> I was rooting for you.

Supergirl.<eos> - Mmm. - Yeah.<eos> You know, it's just...<eos> When I write, I don't need a yellow sun.<eos> It's just me.<eos> Supergirl is what I can do.<eos> Kara is who I am.<eos> I really loved that job.<eos> Hey. You have so much to offer this world.<eos> So don't let Snapper or anyone else tell you differently.
Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> Stand down!<eos> This is Mon-El of Daxam.<eos> To the invaders, I will relinquish myself.<eos> Mon-El, what are you doing?<eos> I'm going up there.<eos> No, no.<eos> They literally just tried to kill me.<eos> How do you know they won't shoot you on sight?
Why would you want to beam yourself up to an unknown spacecraft?<eos> 'Cause, stuff...<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Mon-El...<eos> Are they bowing to us?<eos> Mon-El?<eos> Mother?<eos> Father?<eos> My son.<eos> We finally found you.
The Prince.<eos> Our Prince.<eos> Thank the Gods you're alive.<eos> And returned to us at last.<eos> So, tonight, we feast!<eos> Oh, oh, I can't stay.<eos> I'm also a hero. Well, trying to be with Kara's help and...<eos> Anyway, we have to get...<eos> Son, you can't leave.<eos> We've searched the stars to find you.
I don't know. Were you at the National City Art Museum last night?<eos> Briefly.<eos> What did you do while you were there?<eos> Looking at some art.<eos> - In the middle of the night?<eos> - The lines are shorter.<eos> Winn, come on.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Fine. Lyra and I, we broke in after hours.<eos> It's just, like, when a beautiful woman asks you to do something, you gotta do it!
Well, that classic went missing from the museum last night.<eos> Someone stole a Van Gogh?<eos> Oh, no, well, I mean I didn't see anything.<eos> No, I mean maybe Lyra did.<eos> But listen, we're happy to help, but if I didn't actually witness anything, can I just...<eos> Hey! Look at that photogenic fella.<eos> Wait, where's my girlfriend?<eos> You get how that looks, right?<eos> So, let's review.<eos> You've admitted to being at the scene of a crime, and the security footage doesn't show anyone else but you.
Mon-El, you remember how well your servants were treated at the palace.<eos> Just like family.<eos> Because you stole them from their families.<eos> We liberated them from greater hardship.<eos> We gave them a path.<eos> How did you escape the blasts?<eos> I thought you were dead.<eos> When Krypton exploded, the Kryptonite rained down, killing everything.<eos> We had to get off planet to persevere.<eos> And to find you.
We gave them a path.<eos> How did you escape the blasts?<eos> I thought you were dead.<eos> When Krypton exploded, the Kryptonite rained down, killing everything.<eos> We had to get off planet to persevere.<eos> And to find you.<eos> So that we might return, now that the atmosphere is hospitable.<eos> To make Daxam great again.<eos> Daxam was never great.<eos> Has the Kryptonian rubbed off on you so much so that you have forgotten?
Not how I feel about you...<eos> This changes everything.<eos> It's bad enough you lied, but you being the prince?<eos> I thought you were just born on a cruel planet, but you lead it.<eos> You benefited from its cruelty.<eos> What about that Kryptonian Emissary?<eos> Your guard...<eos> Do you even feel guilty?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> I can't even look at you.
I don't intervene with your job and you don't question mine.<eos> You better have proof.<eos> She doesn't.<eos> The crappy angle doesn't even show Lyra.<eos> I don't think that's a coincidence.<eos> - You think she set him up?<eos> - Exactly. When was the last time you spoke to Lyra?<eos> I mean, I've been trying to call her all day.<eos> Let me guess, her phone is disconnected.<eos> I don't get it. She framed you, Winn.

She framed you, Winn.<eos> Look, I got a partner out there who thinks that you're going to be his 30th arrest of the month.<eos> That's a station record.<eos> I need proof that you weren't involved, or they're going to pin this on you, and I won't be able to stop them.
Maybe you should sit this one out.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> No! I'm ready to Nancy Drew the crap out of this!<eos> Okay, enough with the over-enthusiastic deflecting, all right.<eos> I know you're upset with Mon-El.<eos> And you have every right to be.<eos> Okay?<eos> Own it.<eos> I just, uh... I hate him right now.<eos> I get it, and I hate that he hurt you, but relationships have their ups and downs, Kara.
Her kind hangs out at the trailer park.<eos> Up near Blackmore.<eos> That's where she'd be.<eos> Hamilton?<eos> How you going to pull that one off?<eos> The guy who plays King George is from Rimbor Five.<eos> He owes me a favor.<eos> Your new world is quite stunning.<eos> Like Daxam used to be.<eos> I didn't thank you earlier for looking after my son.
Krypton made horrible mistakes.<eos> I can admit it.<eos> That's more than I expected.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Our planet died on my and my husband's watch.<eos> For our people to rise again, they need a future.<eos> Mon-El is young.<eos> He can be the face of that future.<eos> You want to take Mon-El back to Daxam?<eos> Would you rather he stay here and learn by degrees that he's not good enough for you?
That's the truth.<eos> Maybe it's also true that...<eos> You were different.<eos> I liked you.<eos> Why did...<eos> Why did you con me?<eos> That gang.<eos> My brother, Bastian, works for them, but he hasn't been carrying his weight.<eos> I told them I'd clear his debt.<eos> I didn't want to use you.
You can't!<eos> Okay? You can't take back the fact that you lied to me.<eos> - You can't un-ring that bell.<eos> - Well, I can try. Just forget about you and me for one second.<eos> Do you even understand the second chance you've been given?<eos> You thought you were the last Daxamite and you're not.<eos> Your people are alive.<eos> Your parents are alive.<eos> They need you.<eos> They love you.
Oh, thank God.<eos> Nice job, guys.<eos> It took you long enough.<eos> Yeah, traffic was brutal.<eos> Go.<eos> This was your plan all along.<eos> I mean, if I told you that half of National City's heroes and a squad of DEO Agents was going to show up, were you gonna come along?<eos> Keeping secrets?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Looks like I'm rubbing off on you.
Go get him.<eos> A ring of alien art thieves and the real Starry Night, as promised.<eos> Just kidding...<eos> All within 23 hours and 15 minutes.<eos> Winn Schott and GF exonerated.<eos> Boom.<eos> Um, as for just, like, any connection that Lyra and her brother might have with previous thefts?<eos> Well, I don't have any hard evidence, so I'll take their help in retrieving Van Gogh as a sign of good behavior to come.<eos> You're a good egg, Sawyer.<eos> Leave before I throw you into holding for fun.
Aren't you afraid she's gonna hurt you again?<eos> She didn't do what she did to hurt me.<eos> She was willing to sacrifice herself for someone she cared about.<eos> I mean, that's... That is a girl worth forgiving.<eos> Stuff's going on with you and Mon-El?<eos> - There's... - I'm not dumb, I see things.<eos> Listen...<eos> Whatever idiotic thing he's done, I'm sure...<eos> He has his reasons.<eos> You gotta decide if those reasons are good enough for you or not.
Yeah.<eos> I hope you don't mind, I let myself in.<eos> I just wanted to, um, say a few things...<eos> Before I lose you forever.<eos> 'Cause I owe you a lot...<eos> But most of all, I owe you the truth.<eos> My name is Mon-El.<eos> I'm the former Prince of Daxam.<eos> And I was a spoiled, useless person, that I didn't know.<eos> Until I met you.
'Cause I owe you a lot...<eos> But most of all, I owe you the truth.<eos> My name is Mon-El.<eos> I'm the former Prince of Daxam.<eos> And I was a spoiled, useless person, that I didn't know.<eos> Until I met you.<eos> And I love being a hero because it means I get to spend every single day by your side.<eos> And I love the way that you're honest to a fault.<eos> And the way that you fight for those you care for.<eos> And I love you.

- I would never hurt you on purpose...<eos> - Well, you won't again.<eos> - Kara, don't.<eos> - I can't... I can't do this.<eos> No.<eos> It's over.<eos> Son.<eos> We knew you would return.<eos> Well, Kara ended it.<eos> She did what's best for you.
You never cared about our people before.<eos> Things will be different this time.<eos> They won't. It'll be more of the same.<eos> I think about our lives there and it makes me ill.<eos> I detest who I was.<eos> I was ignorant, and blind to those around me and letting myself be propped up at the expense of our people.<eos> And I'm tired of being served and I'm tired of taking the easy way out.<eos> And I'm done being your prince.<eos> You sound just like her.<eos> That Kryptonian girl has poisoned you...
The best thing I know.<eos> And whether we're together or not, being near her, it makes me a better person.<eos> It makes me the person that I want to be.<eos> I wish you no ill will, but you should leave this planet and never return.<eos> Now send me back.<eos> Send me home, now!<eos> As you wish.<eos> Hey, hey! How you doing, buddy?<eos> Getting there.<eos> I got a little something to perk you up.
Morning, everyone.<eos> Now, we have a new prisoner coming in today.<eos> He's not our typical guest, so look sharp.<eos> Oh, he looks fun.<eos> Oh, there you are.<eos> Uh... Uh...<eos> Who, me?<eos> Yes, yes, you. Why else do you think I'd let myself be caught?<eos> Come on. She's funny.<eos> I've been looking for you.
I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin.<eos> But my pod got knocked off-course and by the time I got here, my cousin had already grown up and become Superman.<eos> I hid who I really was until one day when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.<eos> To most people, I'm a reporter at CatCo Worldwide Media.<eos> But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.<eos> I am Supergirl.<eos> Previously on Supergirl and The Flash...<eos> Mother?<eos> Father?<eos> We finally found you.

I deserve better than being lied to.<eos> You do.<eos> You're right, okay?<eos> I'm a liar.<eos> I can't do this.<eos> No, it's over.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> I'm going to get you out.<eos> I'm so sorry I lied to you.<eos> I forgive you.
Don't really feel like losing you again.<eos> 'Cause that would not be...<eos> Palatable.<eos> Hey, that's a very culinary way to put it.<eos> I cook now.<eos> I'm not going to hide.<eos> I'm the Girl of Steel.<eos> I don't bend. I don't break.<eos> I don't stand down for anyone.<eos> I know none of us can stop you if you choose to go out there, but please, as the people who care about you, give us a day to try and get ahead of this thing.
You placed the bounty on Kara's life.<eos> Did you really think that if you had her killed that I was just going to change my mind and come back with you?<eos> You've become quite imaginative in your time here.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Who else wants her dead and has 300 quartz crowns?<eos> Does she seem like a person who has any shortage of enemies?<eos> I can assure you we have nothing to do with this.<eos> Okay, so, if it's not you, why are you still on Earth?<eos> Because we're hoping you'll come to your senses.<eos> Do you know how long we've been searching for you?
Okay, so, if it's not you, why are you still on Earth?<eos> Because we're hoping you'll come to your senses.<eos> Do you know how long we've been searching for you?<eos> Years.<eos> Spent praying to the gods for the faintest hint of your survival.<eos> We thought we were lost.<eos> That we would be the last generation of Daxamites.<eos> But for your mother's strength, despair would have overwhelmed us.<eos> When you were a child, you used to grab my leg with both arms every time I tried to leave the room.<eos> I would have to peel you off of me like some gangly little magnet.

Even to places that disagree with us.<eos> Maybe she's having trouble parking.<eos> She hates parking, she always valets.<eos> Do you want to try texting her?<eos> It's been 45 minutes.<eos> I'm sure there's a good reason she's not here.<eos> It's okay, Alex.<eos> No, it's...<eos> Look, I feel bad.<eos> I can see it was an awkward thing that I pushed you into and now...
Stand down.<eos> Come at me, bro.<eos> It was the Daxamites!<eos> Queen Rhea placed the bounty...<eos> You know, for a second there, I actually almost believed them.<eos> I mean, you're not safe.<eos> We'll figure this out.<eos> I mean, how?<eos> I know them.<eos> In their minds, they honestly believe that if they get rid of you, then I'm just going to go back home.
And they're...<eos> They get what they want.<eos> That's why we have to talk to your mother.<eos> But J'onn just said we can't engage with them.<eos> No.<eos> He did not say that.<eos> He said we can't attack them.<eos> We can still talk to her.<eos> Then you can get her to realize that all she really wants is for you to be happy.<eos> And then she'll realize that Earth is the best place for you.
Whatever connection you think you've found with my son during this tryst is a lie.<eos> - Hey, are you all right?<eos> I don't feel so...<eos> I should have handled this myself from the beginning.<eos> Where did you get Kryptonite?<eos> Our planet is littered with the corpse of yours.<eos> No, don't!<eos> I crossed an ocean of stars looking for my son.<eos> I'm not going to let you get in my way now.<eos> Your family awaits you.
No resistance?<eos> You have my word.<eos> I'm sorry, Kara.<eos> This is the only way.<eos> So long as you're safe.<eos> Don't go. - Mon-El.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Son.<eos> I can't tell you how thrilled I am to see you here.
It's done.<eos> It was you?<eos> You issued the bounty?<eos> I did what I had to do to get back my son.<eos> What's so urgent?<eos> I went to see Emily.<eos> What...<eos> Why?<eos> Well, I wanted to go talk to her after seeing how upset you were at the restaurant.<eos> I went to stick up for you.
I wanted to.<eos> Listen.<eos> I've thought a lot about this.<eos> You have a pattern of keeping things to yourself.<eos> You hid the truth about Emily, you made her seem like the bad guy.<eos> And then before that, you didn't tell me what really happened when you came out to your parents.<eos> And how badly they reacted.<eos> - You don't like to talk about you.<eos> - I know.<eos> So, I think that when your parents didn't accept you,
And something's happened with Mon-El.<eos> I have to get to the DEO.<eos> I'm...<eos> We'll talk later.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Okay.<eos> Where is she?<eos> What did she do to you?<eos> She had Kryptonite.<eos> We need to get you under a yellow sun lamp.
Take us out.<eos> You just don't know when to let go, do you?<eos> I was gonna say the same thing about you.<eos> Round two.<eos> Winn?<eos> Oh, thank God I am not in space.<eos> You are in space.<eos> Oh, yeah. I know.<eos> I mean, like floating around in space, dying.<eos> Uh, I'm here to rescue you.
Uh, I'm here to rescue you.<eos> Hi.<eos> Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?<eos> You finally saw Star Wars.<eos> The Kryptonite...<eos> Doesn't have much effect on me.<eos> Open sesame.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Let's get out of here before the alarms go off.<eos> Oh, I'm already one step ahead of you.
It's my job to ensure that they do.<eos> I made a decision and I accept the consequences.<eos> Director J'onzz, I will let you know when I decide what those consequences will be.<eos> The ship has left Earth's orbit?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> That will be all for now.<eos> I just want all of these sugary... What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just...<eos> I just really didn't think I was going to see you again.
I just want all of these sugary... What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just...<eos> I just really didn't think I was going to see you again.<eos> After today.<eos> Yeah, me either.<eos> But not for long.<eos> I mean... I knew I couldn't let that happen.<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> And I'm sorry I forced you to talk to your mom.
Nothing.<eos> I just...<eos> I just really didn't think I was going to see you again.<eos> After today.<eos> Yeah, me either.<eos> But not for long.<eos> I mean... I knew I couldn't let that happen.<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> And I'm sorry I forced you to talk to your mom.<eos> I should have listened to you.
And I'm sorry I forced you to talk to your mom.<eos> I should have listened to you.<eos> - I was wrong. - No.<eos> You believe that people can change and you gave them a chance to do it.<eos> Like my father.<eos> He changed.<eos> He understood that I was happy here on Earth.<eos> He saw what I wanted and he found the goodness in his heart to let me stay.<eos> So, you were right to be hopeful.<eos> I think we could all stand to be a little more like you.
We'll let you know if something comes up.<eos> Until then, I'll be upstairs checking the budgets.<eos> I'm gonna go work on that new Lebeckian code breaker.<eos> Thursday morning knife practice.<eos> Okay. Uh...<eos> Well, what am I supposed to do?<eos> Ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! Fifth time's a charm.<eos> Why can't I do it?<eos> Hey!<eos> What brings you to the rent-controlled side of town?
So, I know you're free for dinner, good news, but you have no interest in dinner, bad news.<eos> It's been an emotional roller coaster since I walked in here.<eos> - Oh, yeah, you seem wrecked.<eos> - Oh, completely.<eos> But I'm hoping I don't have enough data.<eos> For instance, would you be willing to go to dinner if I was a factor?<eos> No.<eos> Are you mad at me?<eos> Is it because I cracked the nano code alone?<eos> Seems petty for you.
- That's not true.<eos> - I'm not lying.<eos> Well, then you're mistaken.<eos> Jack would never hurt anyone.<eos> Biomax version 38.<eos> Human trial one.<eos> He's using the nano swarm to kill people.<eos> Who else knows?<eos> Just us.<eos> I won't ask you to bury it, but please let me go talk to him before it gets out.
Uh, look, I, um...<eos> You kind of went a little overboard with the kid from the liquor store.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're right.<eos> I will temper my ways in our next outing.<eos> Yeah, um, just about that kid...<eos> So James and I, we...<eos> We...<eos> We so appreciate your enthusiasm and your participation, and...<eos> We can't have you with us.
I have a brilliant figurehead that will do everything I say.<eos> The entire world will welcome the nano swarm into every hospital, army base, and eventually, home.<eos> - God, you are repulsive.<eos> - I'm a realist.<eos> - What's funny?<eos> - Now you're going to kill me.<eos> That's the only reason you're telling me all of this.<eos> Again, not very financially responsible.<eos> I already control Jack.<eos> Why would I kill you when I can control you, and, by extension, L-Corp?
- I don't know.<eos> Loss does strange things to my family, and I've lost a lot of people.<eos> Well, you're not gonna lose me.<eos> I think when I feel things again, I'm gonna be very, very afraid... Of the person I might be.<eos> You don't have to be afraid.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Promise?<eos> I will always be your friend.<eos> And I will always protect you.
You're welcome.<eos> Um, I'm gonna get a jump start on tomorrow's cover.<eos> Right, uh, yeah, I'll get out of here.<eos> Oh, so now that you share a byline with me, you're too good to work late?<eos> - But I thought...<eos> - I just said you did a good job, Danvers.<eos> You didn't give up, even when that whistleblower got killed.<eos> You weren't afraid to pursue the truth, no matter what the risk.<eos> And we need more reporters like that.<eos> More reporters like you, who care about the truth.
And now it just has a big, Supergirl-sized hole in it.<eos> A thousand things could've happened from the time of your call to the hostages walking out.<eos> Maybe, yeah, sure, I broke some walls, but I got everyone out of there safely, and that is a win.<eos> Well, you should've asked.<eos> But you never look before you leap.<eos> Because I can fly.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, as being something of a superhero myself, I can say that sometimes it's better to punch, than, than to talk.<eos> Sometimes talking is more hurtful than punching.<eos> Obviously, I've upset you, Maggie.
Thank you.<eos> Thanks for dinner.<eos> Babe!<eos> I know you're upset about earlier, but I really...<eos> I just want you and Kara to get along.<eos> Kara and I get along great.<eos> It's Supergirl that I sometimes have trouble with.<eos> Okay, just keep trying.<eos> Okay?<eos> - Okay, for you, yeah.
What, she didn't stay at yours?<eos> She never caught up with me.<eos> Maybe she went to the DEO?<eos> Winn said she didn't check in last night or report this morning.<eos> Mystery solved.<eos> - Alex?<eos> - Hello, Kara Danvers.<eos> Who is this?<eos> Well, the real question is, who are you?<eos> Everyone around you thinks you're just a mild-mannered reporter.
We don't know where Alex was taken, we don't have a crime scene, we don't have any physical evidence.<eos> They've clearly been planning this for a while.<eos> Whoever took Alex is a ghost who doesn't want to be found.<eos> Then what's the right question?<eos> Who is Peter Thompson, and what does he mean to our ghost?<eos> So where did you study?<eos> Undergrad at Oxford, Masters of Engineering from MIT.<eos> I went to MIT.<eos> Did you have Martinez?<eos> I think I was there quite a few years before you, but I will take the compliment.
Don't be silly.<eos> I started it.<eos> I guess since I'm sharing, I should share everything.<eos> These are the key concepts I withheld from the proposal.<eos> I can't wait.<eos> And I give you my word, I will not steal it.<eos> I trust you.<eos> You know, regardless of what happens with business, I have a feeling we're gonna be friends.<eos> To new friends!<eos> Thank the gods I found you.
He has a house an hour outside the city.<eos> Malverne.<eos> Why does that sound so familiar?<eos> Because he grew up in Midvale.<eos> Alex?<eos> Alex!<eos> Alex.<eos> Alex!<eos> Alex!<eos> She can't hear you, Kara.
Why does that sound so familiar?<eos> Because he grew up in Midvale.<eos> Alex?<eos> Alex!<eos> Alex.<eos> Alex!<eos> Alex!<eos> She can't hear you, Kara.<eos> Rick?<eos> Jeez, I haven't seen you since graduation.
You talk about betrayal and people hurting you and then you do it in spades.<eos> I want you out of my office.<eos> And there are several heavily armed guards coming if you have trouble finding your way out.<eos> - Ricky.<eos> - Dad.<eos> All that time in prison, I imagined a day when...<eos> I could talk to you without a pane of glass between us.<eos> And here we are.<eos> Yeah...<eos> It's good to see you, son.
You do not give that terrorist what he wants.<eos> You cannot let yourself be blackmailed.<eos> You cannot open yourself up to that, ever.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> Supergirl is bigger than me.<eos> - Alex.<eos> - Maggie?<eos> - I'm right here!<eos> - Maggie, I need to speak to you alone.<eos> Babe, everyone here is working hard and we're going to find you.
- I'm right here!<eos> - Maggie, I need to speak to you alone.<eos> Babe, everyone here is working hard and we're going to find you.<eos> The water is rising fast and there are things that I need to say.<eos> No.<eos> Don't start talking like this is the end.<eos> I don't want it to be, but in case that it is...<eos> It's not!<eos> You're a badass, Danvers.<eos> And you're gonna figure out a way to get yourself out of there or you're gonna hold on until I find you.
I want more firsts.<eos> I want to have a first vacation.<eos> We haven't even argued about where we're gonna go yet, or how to load the dishwasher.<eos> Or what to name our first dog.<eos> Do you want to get a dog?<eos> Yeah, um...<eos> Let's name her Gertrude.<eos> See, there's a lifetime of firsts that we're going to do together.<eos> So, you hold on, okay?<eos> Hold on until I get to you.
I did what I thought was right...<eos> I should have been heard.<eos> I should have been listened to.<eos> I'm her girlfriend.<eos> I'm her sister!<eos> And you think that trumps me.<eos> That you know what's right for her.<eos> I...<eos> I got her to be herself, Kara.<eos> I have just as much to lose as you.
or fly fast enough and turn back time...<eos> And now I'm afraid I'm going to lose the person that is the most important to me.<eos> To us, Kara.<eos> Maggie was right.<eos> I shouldn't have rushed in.<eos> I made things worse.<eos> I...<eos> Maggie was upset and she was frustrated and she lashed out at you.<eos> You only did what you thought was best to protect your sister.<eos> No one can blame you for that.
Under two hours.<eos> The clock is ticking fast.<eos> I know.<eos> And if it ticks down completely, we both lose.<eos> And I don't think you want to lose.<eos> Neither do you.<eos> I was wrong about Kara.<eos> She's too much of a Girl Scout to do what I need her to do.<eos> I misjudged her.<eos> But I may have discounted you.
What?<eos> - I just really have to say it now.<eos> - Alex...<eos> Just...<eos> It's okay, it's okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Those firsts that you talked about...<eos> I want to have them all with you.<eos> I never want to stop having firsts with you.<eos> I love you, Maggie Sawyer.
- I just really have to say it now.<eos> - Alex...<eos> Just...<eos> It's okay, it's okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Those firsts that you talked about...<eos> I want to have them all with you.<eos> I never want to stop having firsts with you.<eos> I love you, Maggie Sawyer.<eos> I love you, Alex Danvers.
My job.<eos> Protect the identity of Supergirl and the DEO.<eos> - You're gonna mind-wipe him?<eos> - Do you object?<eos> No.<eos> Just...<eos> Before you do...<eos> Just make sure he remembers that.<eos> Will do.<eos> - I need to thank you.
I love these falafels. Do you?<eos> Because they are, like, the best in the city.<eos> I gotta say.<eos> Yeah, they are the best in the city.<eos> You know that because I told you about this falafel stand.<eos> Oh, yes. Yes, you did.<eos> And I'm totally stalking you because, dude, what happened?<eos> Last night you were just...<eos> You were just, like, one and done.<eos> That's not like you.
- but for now...<eos> Today was just our first test.<eos> You can't expect it to be perfect on the first attempt.<eos> I quadruple checked my calculations on this, okay?<eos> The reaction of the polyatomic anions was supposed to be strong enough to spark the core of the generator.<eos> Neither of us has gotten to where we are without persistence.<eos> If I can't make this work, we won't be able to power the portal that we're building.<eos> This was supposed to revolutionize the way everything was transported, eliminate famine, the need for fossil fuels.<eos> I wanted to help my planet.<eos> And get you home to yours.

And pulling him into an interrogation room like some criminal off the street, I don't think is the best way to get him to open up.<eos> So, you're not only a masked vigilante and a photographer, you're also a child psychologist now.<eos> I'm just saying this kid's life has been upended badly.<eos> Okay, first, he's a refugee.<eos> Then his mom ends up missing.<eos> And if he's turned on the TV at all since yesterday, all he's seen are adults yelling about her, calling for blood.<eos> I wouldn't trust anybody either, if I was this kid.<eos> James is right.<eos> I've been in there for hours, and all he does is just stare at the camera.<eos> He's looking at you.
I hate that I still care about her. Hey, we can't will ourselves to not feel anything.<eos> Life doesn't work like that.<eos> On Daxam, that's exactly what we'd do.<eos> We'd drug ourselves, so we literally didn't feel anything.<eos> You're allowed to miss her.<eos> She is your mother.<eos> Well, she's gone forever.<eos> So...<eos> If my mother had given me pep talks like you, imagine the things I could've done.<eos> I'm happy to have mused you.
Go!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Come on, go!<eos> Go!<eos> The building is coming down!<eos> How do we stop him?<eos> It's working.<eos> We did it.<eos> You did it.<eos> Oh, it's okay, I've got you.

I came here in peace, which you refused.<eos> And all of the ugliness that's transpired is because of your righteousness, Kara Zor-El.<eos> Everything that happens from now on is your doing.<eos> Every city that burns, every nation that falls, for every child of Earth that cries out,<eos> "Why is this happening?"<eos> The answer is Supergirl.<eos> Kara has done nothing. Okay?<eos> This is all you!<eos> Oh, of course you're there with her.<eos> The Kryptonian girl who bewitched you.
Oh, of course you're there with her.<eos> The Kryptonian girl who bewitched you.<eos> Mother, you're... you're mad at me here, okay?<eos> Don't...<eos> Don't take it out on this planet.<eos> You are better than this.<eos> Anger has nothing to do with what I'm doing.<eos> Then why?<eos> Why are you still here?<eos> I'm here to wake you up, Mon-El.
Let's go.<eos> Marcus, be careful.<eos> Mom?<eos> Marcus?<eos> Mom!<eos> - Marcus.<eos> - Mom.<eos> No, no, Mom.<eos> These are my friends.<eos> They helped me find you.
For my people.<eos> I want you to know the affection I have for you is real.<eos> Turn it off!<eos> I can't.<eos> Why won't it turn off?<eos> I don't know, she must've made it self-sustaining somehow.<eos> What did you do, Mother?<eos> Marcus.<eos> I need you to look at me.<eos> I told you I would keep you and your mother safe and I am not breaking that promise.
You are not alone!<eos> Hey.<eos> That is a hero without a suit.<eos> Put the gun down, Mon-El.<eos> You don't want to hurt me...<eos> Shut up!<eos> The Kryptonian girl was right.<eos> You are a hero of Earth.<eos> But would a hero kill his own mother?<eos> When you were a boy and I would put you to sleep at night, you used to say to me that you would always love me.
What are you doing?<eos> Thousands of Daxamites survived the destruction of our planet.<eos> They just needed a way to get here.<eos> Turn it off!<eos> You're bringing something here.<eos> You'll see.<eos> Lena!<eos> Hello, Lena.<eos> Where the hell am I?<eos> I've been taking care of you ever since Supergirl nearly killed you when she attacked our portal.

Supergirl tried to stop you.<eos> I should have stopped you.<eos> You lied to me and used me.<eos> I did what I had to do for my people.<eos> But I did it for you, too.<eos> I meant what I said on the ground.<eos> You are a marvel.<eos> And I know that you are meant for bigger things, better things.<eos> This is a planet of wasted potential, and you represent the best of your race.<eos> I'm going to make a society worthy of you.
Everybody evacuate!<eos> Winn, go!<eos> Supergirl!<eos> We're under attack.<eos> - I've evacuated the DEO.<eos> - Hang on!<eos> I'm almost there.<eos> - There's no time.<eos> - All right.<eos> I'll meet you outside.
How's the invasion progressing?<eos> Is it as much fun as you hoped?<eos> This planet has amazing potential.<eos> It's gonna be beautiful when we're finished with it.<eos> "Finished with it"?<eos> What are you planning to do?<eos> Build, of course.<eos> Monuments to our people, to our way of life.<eos> Great pyramids like the ones we had back home.<eos> And I suppose the humans will build them for you.
Great pyramids like the ones we had back home.<eos> And I suppose the humans will build them for you.<eos> If they know what's good for them.<eos> This ship is stocked with Daxam's best.<eos> The leaders, the merchants, the military strategists.<eos> Ah, the robbers, the liars, the killers.<eos> The elite who once led our people to greatness.<eos> Here, we can rebuild again, and make way for the rest of our ravaged population to settle once and for all.<eos> If you think that the people of Earth will just lay down and take this, you are wrong, because they are made of stronger stuff than you think.<eos> And besides, Kara will stop you.
I represent the United States, but today I speak for all humanity when I demand that you abandon your siege of National City.<eos> Well, I'd be happy to move my invasion force to Washington, D.C., if you prefer.<eos> Oh, I'm not in Washington.<eos> I'm heading straight for you.<eos> Uh, guys, I just picked up on some sort of live transmission from Air Force One.<eos> Air Force One?<eos> Wait, don't tell me the President is heading towards the conflict and not away.<eos> Every time I think I can't get happier I voted for that woman...<eos> National City is mine, and you should be thankful that that is all I am currently taking from you.<eos> The militaries of Earth will unite against you.
We are not getting married and we are certainly not giving you an heir.<eos> She doesn't need us for anything.<eos> She just needs our genetic materials.<eos> Daxamites can generate a child using just locks of hair.<eos> Which I collected while you slept.<eos> My son knows me well.<eos> I hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.<eos> So the wedding will legitimize your union in the eyes of the Daxamite people.<eos> We'll have a formal ceremony.<eos> You're insane if you think I'm going through this pageant for you.
When Henshaw was at the Fortress of Solitude...<eos> Breaking in, stealing a deadly virus, and using it to kill aliens in this very bar.<eos> He discovered your cousin keeps a Phantom Zone projector among his Kryptonian artifacts.<eos> A projector?<eos> That sounds kind of low-tech.<eos> They used it to beam the prisoners instantaneously up to Fort Rozz.<eos> - That is very high tech.<eos> - I can re-purpose it to beam us onboard the Daxamite spacecraft.<eos> That's why we need your help.<eos> Give us access to the projector and we bring you aboard.
Then we'll all spend a lot of time getting to know one another in the Phantom Zone.<eos> Turn it on.<eos> I'm curious about something.<eos> You know my real identity.<eos> But you never told Lena.<eos> Why is that?<eos> Eventually, she'll find out on her own.<eos> Find out that you've been lying to her all this time.<eos> And when she does?<eos> She'll hate you for it.
Powering up now.<eos> We are watching closely, Agent Danvers.<eos> We expect you to fire when ready.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Over and out.<eos> Come on, Kara.<eos> - It's locked.<eos> This?<eos> - Break that.<eos> I can see why Kara loves you.
Danvers, this is Lillian Luthor.<eos> We're clear of the supership and safe.<eos> Fire at will.<eos> With pleasure.<eos> Turn it back on, Mother.<eos> I came for you.<eos> Not them.<eos> Supergirl helped you.<eos> How could you betray her?<eos> I put everything on the line to save you from them.
How could you betray her?<eos> I put everything on the line to save you from them.<eos> Supergirl and Mon-El are still aliens and they'll die with their own kind.<eos> I thought you'd finally see my side.<eos> Well, now what are we gonna do?<eos> Lillian betraying us wasn't the biggest shock ever.<eos> So, Winn bugged Henshaw and rigged a remote so I could beam us back if she double-crossed us.<eos> Hope for the best...<eos> Have Winn Schott prepare for the worst.<eos> Your stubborn pride still blinds you to the truth.
So, Winn bugged Henshaw and rigged a remote so I could beam us back if she double-crossed us.<eos> Hope for the best...<eos> Have Winn Schott prepare for the worst.<eos> Your stubborn pride still blinds you to the truth.<eos> Why is it turning back on?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm not in control of myself.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I'm not going with you.<eos> Well, I'm not going without you.
In a few minutes, this ship will be destroyed, and everyone on it.<eos> You don't want that.<eos> Save your people while you still have time.<eos> Touching speech, Supergirl.<eos> Sadly, wasted on the wrong audience.<eos> When my own husband opposed me, I killed him.<eos> You really think you can tug at my heartstrings?<eos> You were right about one thing though.<eos> It is over.<eos> For you.
- So what?<eos> Four fucking people work here.<eos> Not just three.<eos> Fuck this.<eos> What's going on, Bunch?<eos> - Daryll's not counting me.<eos> - What?<eos> And Lena, bossing me around with paper and fucking coffee.<eos> Jesus fucking...<eos> I moved my family back from Pismo Beach for you, Ray.
Sweetheart, you just left him there?<eos> What if he picks purple or orange?<eos> Then he wears purple and orange.<eos> Roberts needs you back in three.<eos> Are you gonna say hello to Terry?<eos> Jesus, Todd.<eos> Terry.<eos> - Todd.<eos> - See you later.<eos> My father's got the boutonnieres for you, your brother, and your uncle.
Jesus, Todd.<eos> Terry.<eos> - Todd.<eos> - See you later.<eos> My father's got the boutonnieres for you, your brother, and your uncle.<eos> Yeah?<eos> And I was wondering if you'd like to make a toast tomorrow.<eos> I don't know about a toast.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> I ran a check on you.
You go on the tour.<eos> - Yeah, but what about...<eos> I'll stay home with Maria, all right?<eos> At least that's one thing I ain't so bad at.<eos> You ain't so bad at a lot of things, Brendan.<eos> Michael's got his semiautomatic in one hand and the bag of cash for his daughter's heart in the other.<eos> "Drop the gun," says the cop.<eos> "Drop the gun."<eos> Michael whispers to himself,<eos> "I can't let you down, Angela."
Be careful.<eos> It's very lovely.<eos> Girl.<eos> No kisses for me then?<eos> We can't complain of their manners. They have none.<eos> - How long is it since their parents...<eos> - Just about two years.<eos> Soon they'll get accustomed.<eos> Àngel!<eos> What will she think of you?
If there was a last planet there would still be something after it.<eos> You're an idiot!<eos> We can't even have class with you!<eos> Enough kids!<eos> Enough!<eos> Enough, calm down!<eos> You're a bitch!<eos> A fucking bitch!<eos> Same as the other.<eos> And I'm gonna kill you!
You're an idiot!<eos> We can't even have class with you!<eos> Enough kids!<eos> Enough!<eos> Enough, calm down!<eos> You're a bitch!<eos> A fucking bitch!<eos> Same as the other.<eos> And I'm gonna kill you!<eos> I'm gonna kill you!
I understand that you don't know about these things But I studied it deeply.<eos> Negation is the natural reaction of a traumatised child.<eos> These kids feel a terrible guilt.<eos> I ask that you believe me, and take it seriously.<eos> Clara.<eos> Clara, do you have any explanation regarding a certain... precociousness in the kids?<eos> What do you refer to?<eos> They seem... mature regarding certain themes.<eos> At a sexual level.<eos> You're worried they will corrupt you?
You know he's here!<eos> How on earth can this man write that?<eos> !<eos> He didn't.<eos> Can't you see it's babies writing?<eos> You're a baby.<eos> You can't write.<eos> Don't be stupid.<eos> Àngel would never write this!<eos> Àngel, he forced you to write it?
I didn't laugh, Ema did.<eos> I would never make fun of you.<eos> You need to tell me why that man hit me.<eos> Why was he so angry?<eos> You know you can tell me everything.<eos> I'm your friend.<eos> - You stole from him?<eos> - No.<eos> I don't steal.<eos> He caught you? Doing things?
OK, I understand.<eos> What were you doing?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You also do it with other boys?<eos> Only w... with those I I... like.<eos> Why are you crying?<eos> Sometimes I c... cry... because it's sad to cry.<eos> They all hate me.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> Who hates you?
Don't worry, I'll fix you.<eos> You're not bad.<eos> Someone is putting bad ideas into your head.<eos> W... what bad ideas?<eos> If they were not bad, you would not be crying.<eos> It's the dark soul of the gardener that is surrounding you.<eos> I can see it.<eos> And you can also.<eos> He stole your soul.<eos> Someone's forcing you to do these things.
!<eos> That isn't proper.<eos> You cannot do that!<eos> He put those ideas in your mind?<eos> !<eos> It was him, wasn't it!<eos> You making me feel bad again!<eos> You came into my room when I said no, and no you don't let me do anything!<eos> - Why d... did you come here?<eos> - Because I love you!
I'm sure you'll start liking it.<eos> In any case, I'll be waiting for you.<eos> Your uncle will arrive soon.<eos> - Who prescribes your drugs?<eos> - Their uncle is a doctor.<eos> Medicinal<eos> And now I'm cutting your wings.<eos> If he'd told you, you wouldn't have come.<eos> It was a good strategy<eos> Your friend is waiting for you.
Maybe a worker we had...<eos> Anything.<eos> - Get out of here!<eos> - Have you seen my boy?<eos> - Get lost!<eos> - Haven't you seen my boy José?<eos> - I've been looking for him...<eos> - Get lost I said!<eos> - I'm taking the kids to the city, so leave them alone!<eos> They're going to kill you!
I'm a firebird!<eos> Come here, you're possessed!<eos> Fucking bitch!<eos> - Look!<eos> Now tell me there isn't anyone there!<eos> - Let me go!<eos> Your crazy!<eos> Tell me what you did together and we'll get rid of him!<eos> There never was anyone, crazy filthy bitch!<eos> Tell me, and he won't harm you anymore!
Coward, coward!<eos> Filthy whore!<eos> Killer whore!<eos> Bitch!<eos> Where are the kids?<eos> They're fine.<eos> - And the uncle?<eos> - He's left.<eos> I need to see Àngel, he wants to speak to me.<eos> Àngel doesn't want to see you.
Killer whore!<eos> Bitch!<eos> Where are the kids?<eos> They're fine.<eos> - And the uncle?<eos> - He's left.<eos> I need to see Àngel, he wants to speak to me.<eos> Àngel doesn't want to see you.<eos> Nor Ema.<eos> They hate you.
The insane woman imagined they were her own children to defend even against their parents<eos> Their uncle feels very guilty.<eos> But he's correcting it.<eos> Correcting?<eos> Correcting how?<eos> He left, and left the kids alone.<eos> More vulnerable to abuse than ever before.<eos> The abuse you dream of every night?<eos> Look at you.<eos> It's the kids who abused of you.
The abuse you dream of every night?<eos> Look at you.<eos> It's the kids who abused of you.<eos> You made them feel stupid.<eos> You taught them only shame.<eos> And now you crown yourself their protector?<eos> - You're crazy, Clara.<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> I'm crazy.<eos> Everyone is crazy except you.
He believed them, believed he was bad.<eos> Believed in all those stupidities.<eos> And look at you people now.<eos> Yesterday attacking these so-called perverts and today screaming in the street for tolerance, crying compassionately for men in love. Feasting when they marry them in churches<eos> Oh, how angry it makes, all of this...<eos> How many false morals from even more false people!<eos> And now I'm supposed to swallow your moralistic stupidities?<eos> !<eos> You've drugged me again.<eos> I'm going to denounce you for aiding this child abuse.
If I fill in those blanks, I have to put my name on it.<eos> We've long suspected criminal activity at Axe Capital.<eos> You have nothing on Axe Cap and even less on me.<eos> Hey, hey. I tried calling.<eos> Phone's been off.<eos> I'm going to go put the boys to bed.<eos> I am so close to getting Axe.<eos> You will get him... on something else.<eos> Sandicot is a circle.<eos> It leads right back to you.
In it?<eos> That's right.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause it's a winner.<eos> And you know this because...<eos> Because I saw it... exactly what would happen with this company and what it would do for me.<eos> I've only seen three things that clearly in my life.<eos> One was my first time actually arguing in court.<eos> I knew it was my calling.<eos> Second was when I met you... and I knew it was my destiny.
This is not gonna be pleasant for whoever you hire.<eos> It's got to be people you trust.<eos> There can't be any clear connection.<eos> I got it.<eos> I have some ideas.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> What do you mean, you can't?<eos> You got to do it.<eos> Look, you promised me, and you owe me.<eos> I still owe you, but I can't do this to myself, man... not even for you.
Big time.<eos> Pounded a company he's in.<eos> Your friends at the bar helped. Everyone stepped up.<eos> Good.<eos> Those don't look like Bruno's.<eos> Fuck Bruno.<eos> Ryan did those up in the wood-burning oven.<eos> Remember our real first date?<eos> Caviar.<eos> I was trying to dazzle you.
My wife has bipolar disorder.<eos> Our thief is staking out these stores.<eos> He follows his targets home with their new stuff, then he hits their house later.<eos> Melissa and Douglas London.<eos> Their son, Keith, was supposed to arrive home last night and never turned up.<eos> He has his next victim.<eos> This is Edie's show now.<eos> I know she doesn't look like much, but she's ready.<eos> I made him bleed.<eos> For you.
You're ridiculous.<eos> Oh yeah?<eos> You ever tried it?<eos> Come on.<eos> Come out here.<eos> Spread your legs.<eos> Put your arms out.<eos> Take a deep breath.<eos> Serial numbers from six different bills, all fifties.<eos> I'll get you back.
How'd you find my house?<eos> Followed you from the station.<eos> Yesterday.<eos> Drove all over this pretty little town.<eos> You even know how to use that thing?<eos> Don't think it's very complicated.<eos> What's this?<eos> Everything I could manage short of selling my house.<eos> Will you walk out of here with that?<eos> I never want to see you again.
She is, yeah.<eos> And for a second there, I thought you were making a plea from the heart but you're just afraid of getting caught, just like everybody else.<eos> Take the money.<eos> Never come back.<eos> Hey kiddo.<eos> You're here- you're here now?<eos> Well I don't understand.<eos> I thought you were... what about class?<eos> Well sure, sure.<eos> I'll-I'll-I'll come pick you up.
No ID yet, but I'm guessing it's connected to the burnt out truck my boys found off Mukwa Road.<eos> Any sign of torture?<eos> It's hard to say yet.<eos> He's wrapped up pretty good but it does look like he was tortured.<eos> IDENT found it nearby.<eos> Our corpse has all ten of his so they're running the print.<eos> Tell me you're up for this right now, John.<eos> What's on your mind, Jer?<eos> If more had been done to stop this guy back when it was just an Indian girl, none of this would be happening.<eos> I defended you more times than you know.
But it could lead the police to your place.<eos> Edie.<eos> Edie.<eos> It doesn't matter because they won't find anything because you're gonna get him out of there.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't lift him.<eos> I'm twenty minutes away from your place.<eos> This has to happen now.<eos> You can do it.<eos> I believe in you.
I'll get the new place set up.<eos> Edie. What's going on?<eos> We're trying to have a kid.<eos> The joke's on me because I found these.<eos> If this isn't something that you want, you need to say so.<eos> He got a cop killed.<eos> He tipped them off, Delorme, and he erased the evidence.<eos> That's the kind of secret that you pay to keep quiet.<eos> You walk out of here with that<eos> I never want to see you again.
Because he's not a doctor, he doesn't know any better.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I'm not saying anything.<eos> I'm asking.<eos> Are we missing a piece?<eos> You're being investigated for corruption.<eos> That's why I was transferred to CIS.<eos> I told you, there's nothing to find.<eos> Yesterday a woman named<eos> Tammy Lidstrom visited you.
I'm asking.<eos> Are we missing a piece?<eos> You're being investigated for corruption.<eos> That's why I was transferred to CIS.<eos> I told you, there's nothing to find.<eos> Yesterday a woman named<eos> Tammy Lidstrom visited you.<eos> She's the ex-girlfriend of Delroy Moss.<eos> Delroy was your inside guy in Toronto.<eos> He connects you to Kyle Corbett.
Come in.<eos> Here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Are you Detective Cardinal's daughter?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Kelly.<eos> What's your name?<eos> I saw him on TV.<eos> Yeah. He's been in the news lately, unfortunately.<eos> Did he ask you to come by?
Do you have a gun?<eos> - No.<eos> - Good.<eos> No!<eos> Stop it! Please!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Dad!<eos> Please.<eos> You took Eric from me.<eos> Now I'm gonna take something from you.
- Who?<eos> My girlfriend, Lucy. Hi.<eos> How you doing?<eos> We... we're... we're dating.<eos> Still?<eos> - Josh, step into my office.<eos> - Ay.<eos> So what do you think of my office?<eos> It's a bit much.<eos> Joshua, I have been advising you for years, okay?
- Who?<eos> - My girlfriend, Lucy.<eos> Hi, again.<eos> Hi, again.<eos> Oh... Ah! I don't think your friend Mike likes me very much.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - He... he likes you.<eos> - Really?<eos> He just doesn't know you very well.
I hate them so much. I hate them so much.<eos> Whew.<eos> Oh, he just... texted me again.<eos> "Did I scare you?"<eos> Huh, that's curious.<eos> You're, like, literally the only person I've ever told about my, uh, fear of horses, so... Huh.<eos> Hmm. Okay.<eos> You know what?<eos> Um... I got to split.<eos> Love you.
- Yes.<eos> How does Mike know all this stuff about me?<eos> I'd like to thank my informant, who at this time I will not name... because I'm blanking on it, uh, but it's Josh's girlfriend.<eos> She told me everything.<eos> Just blabbed away.<eos> Hey, Josh... Josh... How could you do that?<eos> The entire world is laughing at me.<eos> Because Mike told everybody, not me.<eos> Yeah, of course Mike told everybody.<eos> I would expect that from him, but not from you.
I hate to be the one to tell you this.<eos> Tim went out on the Arkansas River.<eos> He's been missing for two days now.<eos> I thought for sure the president would have heard.<eos> I mean, I can't imagine how Frank's gonna take this.<eos> Oh, my goodness!<eos> Beth and the kids must be so distraught.<eos> Sure.<eos> But Frank and Tim's relationship was special.<eos> It's great to see you, Claire.
In what way?<eos> In...<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> I'm sure I don't know anything you don't.<eos> I'm just very interested in your perspective.<eos> Frank worshipped Tim, would have done anything for him.<eos> I don't know.<eos> If the world were a different place back then... who knows?<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> And then he met you.
At least half the Beltway seems to think it's outrageous.<eos> It is outrageous.<eos> We could resign our posts, you know, in protest.<eos> I bet we can convince others of the cabinet to do the same thing.<eos> Outrageous by design, I was going to say.<eos> It's smart, what the president's doing.<eos> -It's serving him in the polls.<eos> -Donald.<eos> Let's... take a step back for a moment.<eos> I underestimated you.
Traffic lights have been disabled.<eos> One area train has been derailed.<eos> The system that maintains our sewers has been tampered with.<eos> The perpetrators were targeting the government and their ultimate purpose, though foiled, was to disrupt all mid-Atlantic transportation networks.<eos> Events like these underscore the urgency of my request to Congress for a declaration of war.<eos> Tonight, I can only suspect Congress will spend a dark night of the soul, after which they will reconsider their paralysis and choose to act.<eos> Capital East Telecom has informed me that it's repairing the network as fast as possible, but that it will take at least a couple more days to be fully restored.<eos> It is an unfortunate but undeniable fact that we will continue to experience attacks until ICO and other terrorist groups like it are eliminated swiftly and completely.<eos> Thank you.<eos> May God bless you.
Did I imagine it?<eos> No.<eos> I've found his Christening port!<eos> Amazing year.<eos> - There'll be some fines tonight. - Mm!<eos> I thought I might go to St Magnus's church at Little Beckley tomorrow.<eos> Would you like to do some rubbings with me?<eos> I gather there are some fascinating brasses.<eos> Since the majority of my adult life will be spent in churches, I think I may stay in town tomorrow.<eos> I'll do some rubbings for you.
Why hasn't there been a sports day for three years?<eos> Yes, Pennyfeather.<eos> Perhaps I will go and find him now. See you later.<eos> See you later.<eos> Beste-Chetwynde?<eos> Where's your mother from?<eos> If you don't mind me asking?<eos> Er, California.<eos> Her family are originally from Ciudad Guayana.<eos> It's just that I saw her dropping you off after the exeat.
That will be seat 23A.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You are confirmed for seat 23B.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, yeah, sooner is better on that paperwork, John.<eos> Just to remind you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And thanks for the pipetalk.<eos> No problem.<eos> We value you.
Her parents ran a cemetery.<eos> She stole me a ring off a corpse.<eos> How romantic.<eos> Illegal and creepy, but very romantic.<eos> She left me for a professional water-skier.<eos> She said she was the only woman who ever looked hot in a life vest.<eos> How do you fight that?<eos> I think we need more padding. Like a base layer.<eos> You know, like a... like a tarp or something.<eos> Whoa. I didn't even ask you to move in, Pipes.
Uh, Janae, I'd like to speak with you.<eos> Ooh. Watson getting called out.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> For what?<eos> - Here, I got my permission slip.<eos> - Ah, excellent.<eos> I want to make sure you're coming tomorrow.<eos> You excited?<eos> - Yeah. I guess.<eos> - I'm excited for you.
I missed you.<eos> How's everything out there?<eos> I'm good.<eos> Gettin' mad job offers.<eos> You know, different nail salons.<eos> After they seen my cheetah toes, everybody been fightin' over me.<eos> - You see? I told you you'd kill it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You called it.<eos> How about you?
when I brush your cheek like that?<eos> No, I like it just fine.<eos> You're just not supposed to be doing anything that I don't say.<eos> - That's the rules.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - You gonna let me lead or not?<eos> - Yes. - Okay.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Keep telling me what you want me to do.<eos> I wanna do to you what the vibrating phone did.
- That's the rules.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - You gonna let me lead or not?<eos> - Yes. - Okay.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Keep telling me what you want me to do.<eos> I wanna do to you what the vibrating phone did.<eos> Seeing you get turned on, it was...<eos> It was so hot.<eos> I wanna turn you on.
Voilà.<eos> Your reading nook.<eos> - What's "Oh, huh" about it?<eos> Well, I thought we talked about the reading nook being a bit more about reading and less about... clutter.<eos> I like having things around, Piper.<eos> It comforts me.<eos> I'm a collector.<eos> Why don't you go over there and sit on your dirty yoga mat and admire your... collections?<eos> Do you not want me to be comfortable in our dirt home?<eos> I'm simply asking you if these items spark joy.

Let's go to your solo, second bridge.<eos> You need to give this a lot more soul here, honey.<eos> Channel your inner Aretha and let those "No's" rip.<eos> ♪ You're gonna love... ♪ I know, right?<eos> So moving.<eos> Sing it, Effie!<eos> - Yo, you just hit 10,000 views!<eos> - No shit!<eos> Let me see this.<eos> All these comments are about you, though.
You... you had a hearing already?<eos> - No.<eos> - Then it's not a done deal.<eos> And with the speed paperwork moves around Litchfield,<eos> I wouldn't be surprised if his recommendation is not even in your file yet.<eos> Have you seen your file?<eos> Piscatella, he's a... monster.<eos> He should never have been working here in the first place, and that's my fault.<eos> But you do not have to become the monster he's making you out to be.<eos> I've seen you with the other inmates.

I've seen you with the other inmates.<eos> They look up to you.<eos> Huh?<eos> Ruiz?<eos> Stratman?<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Okay, enough.<eos> You have to tell me what's going on.<eos> What?<eos> Why there is an army of lemmings dressed like you, moving out here.
- What things from your history?<eos> That I killed Aydin.<eos> You told them that you killed Aydin?<eos> I didn't say Aydin specifically.<eos> I just shared my... I don't know, status as a...<eos> as a murderess.<eos> I don't know, it just came out.<eos> We were supposed to take that to the grave.<eos> I went to Von Barlow and I begged her - to keep it a secret...<eos> - I didn't ask you to do that.
I got a kid to think about.<eos> You'd understand, Tommy, if you had one.<eos> Hey, no matter what happens, I got your back.<eos> Just like we all did in the neighborhood, and just like I did with Milan.<eos> Did you fight back?<eos> No.<eos> It was two against one and I was handcuffed.<eos> Good.<eos> It's like I said before, everyone in here thinks you're James St. Patrick.<eos> No matter how much people mess with you, you're gonna have to suppress Ghost.
Love triangle would have been a great narrative, except, all of you assholes knew Valdes was sleeping with both of them.<eos> If that became public knowledge, all of you would potentially be called up as witnesses for the defense, royally fucking your credibility and the department's.<eos> But this is the narrative we can prove.<eos> We put Angela on the stand, she gives us the case in one piece of testimony.<eos> We get ahead of the story, right, Mike?<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> Got off on the wrong floor.<eos> Angela, have a seat.<eos> Introducing your relationship will be handing the jury a motive, wrapped in a bow.<eos> If you take the stand, the prosecution will eviscerate you.
So that's how I'm supposed to behave?<eos> 'Riq...<eos> Hey.<eos> That gun you brought to school, is it the same one your dad used to kill that FBI agent?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> Are you stupid or something?<eos> Mom told us not to say anything.<eos> She's a liar, just like Dad.<eos> Sup with you, 'Riq?<eos> It's like I don't even know you anymore.
Unfortunately, these things just take time.<eos> Hand the phone to your brother, please.<eos> I need you to be the man of the house until I come home, all right, 'Riq?<eos> That means taking care of your two sisters and being respectful to your mother.<eos> I got it, Dad.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Thank you for coming to see me.<eos> You have no idea how much it means to me.<eos> I want you to know how much I love you and that of everything I've accomplished in life, the thing that I'm most proud of is being your father.<eos> We love you too, Dad.
Julio got Cristobal back on board, but his homey, Domingo, was running his mouth. H-he got one off.<eos> And Julio didn't stop that shit?<eos> Talk!<eos> Marcus tried to step in, but Domingo stepped to his slow ass first.<eos> I mean, shit was about to pop off, but Cristobal took care of it.<eos> Told his nigga to step off.<eos> Cristobal.<eos> Not Julio.<eos> Did something jump off with Ghost? No.<eos> I'm just checkin' in on you.
If I know Tommy, he can't help himself.<eos> Then we're going to catch him.<eos> Did you bring the re-up for my wife?<eos> I got a call from Dre.<eos> He said the Feds found a fucking gun at Truth?<eos> I mean, he didn't really do it.<eos> He says he didn't, and I believe him, but the jury won't.<eos> They're saying he did it because you asked him to, because you're partners. Oh.<eos> So if he goes down, I go down? Yes.<eos> And they're gonna be looking for any reason they can get to bring you in.
Stay out of the game for a while.<eos> Shit's bad timing, Proctor.<eos> Angela knows everything about you. She's gonna be lookin' to bring you in.<eos> This all happened because he couldn't keep his fuckin' hands off of her.<eos> I told him to stay away from that bitch.<eos> I told him too.<eos> Things are gonna get worse.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll keep a low profile.<eos> But if shit does go sideways and I do get arrested, I'm gonna kill you.
If it were me sitting on the other side of that table, I would strongly consider flipping.<eos> Yeah, but you know what, Proctor?<eos> It's not you on the other end of this table. It's me.<eos> It's me and Tommy.<eos> - Come on, get in here. - Oh, Tommy.<eos> Whoa, Tommy, thank God you're okay.<eos> I heard about Jamie on the news.<eos> Is that why you wanted me to come into the city?<eos> I woulda gotten here sooner, except the goddamn trains are a fucking mess.<eos> I'm worried about you.
Is that why you wanted me to come into the city?<eos> I woulda gotten here sooner, except the goddamn trains are a fucking mess.<eos> I'm worried about you.<eos> Well, I'm fine for now, but t-the heat could be coming down any minute.<eos> At least that fucking FBI agent who came to the house is dead.<eos> Here's hoping that whatever he had on you and Jamie died with him. Ma, don't talk about Ghost.<eos> He's the reason we're all in this fucking mess.<eos> All 'cause he couldn't stay away from Angela.<eos> Looks like you got girl trouble too.<eos> Holly left you, huh?
I would like to join the strategy meeting, John.<eos> Come on, we talked about this.<eos> You're on the bench.<eos> And now that the stakes are this high, it's better for everyone.<eos> I'll keep you in the loop.<eos> And I'll make sure we see St. Patrick get the shot.<eos> Hello?<eos> You know, I used to work the death row detail at Leavenworth.<eos> They say it's painless, but actually it's not.<eos> See, the drugs paralyze you, but you conscious.
When exactly did you start receiving her personal bank statements?<eos> I don't know. I ain't the god damn post office.<eos> Ms. Grant, you don't have a record.<eos> You haven't committed a crime.<eos> As far as I can tell, you're a good person.<eos> Answer my questions and you can get back to your life, your shop, your son.<eos> If you don't cooperate, I can't help you.<eos> See, the thing is, you already know the answers to these questions you askin' me.<eos> You know when he moved out, when he was sleeping on the couch, when she sold her ring.<eos> Because of you.
But you shoulda kept your damn mouth shut.<eos> I did the best I could.<eos> Why the fuck was she asking me all that anyway?<eos> Because she's a bitch!<eos> Well, actually, Mrs. St. Patrick...<eos> What?<eos> Well, if they can prove that your marriage to James was really over, a business arrangement at this point, they may be able to break spousal privilege.<eos> The fuck does that mean?<eos> Angela would argue before a judge that you are now more of an accomplice than a wife.<eos> She could force you to testify against James.
Hi... Bailey.<eos> Greg's friend.<eos> Your sister never called me after the double date.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Right.<eos> I hope it's all right, me dropping by.<eos> Sure.<eos> Come in.<eos> It's been a while.<eos> Actually, I saw you at Greg's funeral.
Oh, right.<eos> Right.<eos> I hope it's all right, me dropping by.<eos> Sure.<eos> Come in.<eos> It's been a while.<eos> Actually, I saw you at Greg's funeral.<eos> Seemed like you were trying to stay out of sight.<eos> Yeah... I didn't think Greg's family would want to see me.<eos> Yeah, I don't know if they blame you, but I do.

I didn't think Greg's family would want to see me.<eos> Yeah, I don't know if they blame you, but I do.<eos> I know Greg was so focused on St. Patrick because of you.
Met with Tommy Egan last night.<eos> And this is the list of people the Feds are questioning as potential witnesses against James.<eos> And why did you meet with Egan?<eos> I represented Tommy before James.<eos> You... If you represented Egan, you can't represent St. Patrick.<eos> That's a clear conflict of interest. You have to recuse yourself.<eos> There's no conflict.<eos> St. Patrick and Egan's interests are the same.<eos> St. Patrick goes home... everybody's happy.<eos> I hired you because you get innocent guys off.
But I can tell you conclusively, there is no chance of ever hearing that inadmissible bullshit play in my court.<eos> I'm gonna fuck off.<eos> Yeah, fuck right off.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> I need you to do me a solid.<eos> Need you to find out anything you can on a Tony Teresi.<eos> He's an inmate in here.<eos> I gotta be careful, James.<eos> Every time I stick my neck out for you, I open myself up for exposure.
My lawyers stay right here, Angela.<eos> I don't trust you.<eos> What is this?<eos> Why-why are you here, huh?<eos> Confess to killing Greg, give us Tommy for the Lobos murder, and I promise I'll get your sentence reduced as much as I can.<eos> I won't confess to something I didn't do.<eos> Jamie, we'll break spousal privilege and force Tasha to testify as your accomplice.<eos> And if she refuses, we'll prosecute her.<eos> What will happen to your kids if you and Tasha both go to jail?<eos> If you die by lethal injection, will Yasmine even remember you?
Can I... can I talk to her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come here, baby.<eos> It's your father.<eos> Daddy, I'm sorry.<eos> Oh-no-shh-shh-shh.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know how hard this is on you.<eos> Are they going to kill you?
I did.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - It's your fuckin' fault.<eos> Getting the media involved in the first fuckin' place.<eos> It was the right move at the time.<eos> Fuck your right move.<eos> That's my daughter, man.<eos> You got one of those.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And they're just trying to break you.
Good work.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's keep it crackin'.<eos> And remember, if it dies down...<eos> Everybody get a blue chip on the house. That's right.<eos> But never interrupt me again.<eos> Spanky, nothing pops off, all right?<eos> Yo. Mayweather.<eos> Nothing pops off.<eos> I heard you, motherfucker. We good.
You're welcome.<eos> Just doing my job.<eos> I'm not... here because you're innocent, St. Patrick.<eos> I'm here because you can pay and your money will allow me to help those who actually deserve it.<eos> Look, man, I admit I need you.<eos> What I don't need is your judgment.<eos> Wow, that...<eos> That's why you really called me here?<eos> It kills you, doesn't it?<eos> Someone being able to see through you, someone... someone reminding you that you did it the cheap way, just like the rest of these cats in here.

Oh, Josh, you don't want to forget your popcorn for the road.<eos> Actually, you know what?<eos> I seem to have lost my appetite for popcorn.<eos> Boy, you were right, your parents sure are - passive-aggressive. - Josh.<eos> Josh, wait. What?<eos> What?<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, mmm.<eos> That's nice.<eos> I love you.

Ah! Man, it's so cool this agency's already inviting you to parties.<eos> Yeah, it's great.<eos> Do you think there will be shrimp?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Am I dressed okay?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> You look incredible.<eos> Thanks, I just-I really want to make a good impression, so...<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You are brilliant, the agency loves you, you look beautiful, and there's a strong possibility of shrimp.
A killer with principles.<eos> Hey, What's the big idea?<eos> Well, I thought that given your considerable talent, it's only fair that I even out the odds.<eos> This was not part of our deal.<eos> And I've been thinking, what am I gonna do with a rat...<eos> Who rats out his friend?<eos> You two... You... you're gonna live or die together.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> You don't know who to trust these days, huh?<eos> Give me one good reason why I don't kill you right now.
Friends.<eos> To Reese and Hera.<eos> May your days be blessed with peace.<eos> And your nights with lust!<eos> I also want to thank you, all of you, for welcoming me back into your grace.<eos> These past few months have been the happiest I can remember in a very long time.<eos> You saved me.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hear, hear.<eos> We didn't save you... The gods did.
What's this?<eos> A wedding in our own backyard.<eos> And we weren't invited.<eos> Come here, sweetheart.<eos> Leave her alone!<eos> Going somewhere, sweetheart?<eos> Yeah!<eos> I told you, these people make it almost too easy.<eos> Come on, peaches.<eos> Don't worry, we'll bring you back.
Tonight, we have much to celebrate.<eos> Spider's silk.<eos> Those curtains cost more than an entire shipment of opium.<eos> Hello, Ryder.<eos> Well, you look like your father.<eos> You look like you survived quite the battle.<eos> Uh, can we bring some food, some wine from the kitchen?<eos> I'm fine, really.<eos> Please, I insist.<eos> What brings you all the way here?
Uh, can we bring some food, some wine from the kitchen?<eos> I'm fine, really.<eos> Please, I insist.<eos> What brings you all the way here?<eos> It's the nomads, they raided us.<eos> Quinn always kept my father's people protected.<eos> And now you need my protection.<eos> You're my mother.<eos> Of course I'll help you.<eos> The gods will bless you for this.
The gods will bless you for this.<eos> Oh, you know I'm not the religious type.<eos> Almost half of them worship the same gods we do.<eos> Showing you're a friend to the totemists will help pacify your own workers.<eos> And who says they're not already?<eos> News travels slower out in the wilds, but even I've heard the stories...<eos> Cogs abandoning your poppy fields to go work for the widow?<eos> I'm handling the widow.<eos> But that's not what people think.<eos> Remember what I taught you, you have to either make them love you, or fear you.

You can't keep us here forever.<eos> Why, you make it sound like you're a prisoner.<eos> Veil, be sensible, we both know how dangerous it is for you out there.<eos> Sunny left behind so many enemies, what might happen if one ever got their hands on his child.<eos> It's time for his nap.<eos> Of course. Hmm.<eos> Sweet dreams, my prince.<eos> That boy is lucky to have you, veil.<eos> We both are.<eos> Some evenings I, I lie awake, thinking what might have become of me if you hadn't found me that night sunny abandoned you.
Me neither.<eos> It might have been good.<eos> She's got great tits too.<eos> I sit right down front.<eos> Here, listen to this.<eos> She recommended this book.<eos> "If you write about something that happened to you, you may reexperience some old emotions."<eos> How much?<eos> How much what?<eos> How much they charging you for that class?
Now you say something nice about me.<eos> You give a fantastic blow job.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sure.<eos> You're a loving father.<eos> Come on.<eos> Go. You give a fantastic hand job?<eos> It's true.<eos> Where you going?<eos> I got a surprise for you.
If you wish to accept the call, please press one now.<eos> To decline...<eos> Raymond?<eos> What the fuck, Terry?<eos> I fucked up.<eos> I went somewhere I shouldn't have gone.<eos> A whorehouse.<eos> I'm in the jail in Pahrump.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll pick you up in about an hour.
Back to you, Karen.<eos> Daryll got a guy, big shot at ACA, to read my script, but they said to send it over as a PDF, so what is it?<eos> You can't turn paper into a PDF.<eos> Then what the fuck they talkin' about?<eos> I'll have someone take it over for you.<eos> Thank you, Raymond.<eos> That's very nice of you.<eos> Hey.<eos> Come here.<eos> She's watching over you, you know.
Will you marry me?<eos> Will you be my wife?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Put it on.<eos> Cheers.<eos> May the sun shine warm upon your face.<eos> May the rain fall soft upon the fields.<eos> And until we meet again...<eos> May God hold you in the palm of his hand.
I'll be there. Don't be late.<eos> I won't.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> You look good.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You too.<eos> You want one?<eos> No.<eos> So, what can I do for you?
Beat him to death.<eos> So, as far as I can tell, he's nothing but a cheating, crippled cocksucker, and...<eos> Whoa!<eos> Say one word, Todd.<eos> I fucking dare you.<eos> - Retard.<eos> - No, Bunch... - Hey! - Fuck.<eos> - You motherfucker.<eos> - Fucker, let's go!<eos> - I'll fucking kill you!
Oh, thank God for that!<eos> One move and you're down!<eos> No, no, please don't!<eos> How many times, Davina?<eos> How many times do I have to tell you I hate giving chase?<eos> Bloody hell, look at the state of me!<eos> I'm knackered, I'm sweat-dripping!<eos> I'm going to be uncomfortable for the whole bloody day now!<eos> Please!<eos> Look, I'm asking you, right, woman to woman, yeah?
Oh, she's... she's fine.<eos> She's married and she's got a couple of kids.<eos> I just found out I'm pregnant.<eos> You left it late.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I suppose I did.<eos> You'll love it.<eos> Will I?<eos> I don't know.<eos> How about you, you and Stephen?
Yeah. Good to see you, man.<eos> And you.<eos> I didn't realise you'd ended up round these parts.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's temporary.<eos> Still, big fish in a small pond, eh?<eos> You in Manchester?<eos> Yeah, yeah, for my sins.<eos> Oh, cool. Good.<eos> So, um... what can I do for you?
This room.<eos> You know, you tell people that you're pregnant and they're all, like, "Oh, wow!<eos> "Oh, my God, you're going to be amazing!" Huh!<eos> What if I'm not?<eos> I can't see myself in elasticated jeans, wiping arses.<eos> What?<eos> Wait here.<eos> Now, imagine we have one who looks like her.<eos> Oh, now, she's cute.<eos> You wouldn't mind that face looking up at you.
What?<eos> Wait here.<eos> Now, imagine we have one who looks like her.<eos> Oh, now, she's cute.<eos> You wouldn't mind that face looking up at you.<eos> I'm going to remind you of that when she needs feeding at four o'clock in the morning.<eos> You were a cute kid.<eos> I'm excited, Helen.<eos> This is a new start for us.<eos> I love you.

Helen Weeks?<eos> It's me!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Don't tell me you don't remember?<eos> No, of course I do.<eos> Paula Days, your Jenny's mate!<eos> I know, I know.<eos> Fancy seeing you here.<eos> Days and Weeks back together.<eos> I looked for you a few times on Facebook.
'Bye.<eos> 'Hey, Hels, I'm just heading into town, 'why don't you meet me in the pub in a bit?<eos> Paul, we need to talk.<eos> Paul, I've got to tell you something.<eos> Paul... I...<eos> I really messed up, Paul, and, er... I really hope this baby's yours, but...<eos> Look who it is...<eos> Linda Bates's girlfriend.<eos> Fucking rug-muncher.<eos> Waiting for you at home, is she?
Which newspaper?<eos> All right. Last chance, before I really hurt you.<eos> What newspaper?<eos> The-The Post!<eos> Right. Why don't... We'll pay you... to tell your side of the story.<eos> Why don't you get out of here before I shove those stupid glasses up your bony tabloid arse?<eos> Scum.<eos> "Bony tabloid arse"?<eos> You're a good friend.<eos> No, I... and I never blamed you.
The-The Post!<eos> Right. Why don't... We'll pay you... to tell your side of the story.<eos> Why don't you get out of here before I shove those stupid glasses up your bony tabloid arse?<eos> Scum.<eos> "Bony tabloid arse"?<eos> You're a good friend.<eos> No, I... and I never blamed you.<eos> We were both victims.<eos> But... it's because of me.<eos> He got to you through me.
Why?<eos> Because it means you're wrong?<eos> Why would she lie?<eos> What's she got to gain?<eos> She's got text after text proving the affair.<eos> She gives Bates a rock-solid alibi for the time you've got him murdering Abigail Toms.<eos> You're determined to prove me wrong, aren't you?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's not about you.<eos> Why don't you see what's staring you straight in the face?
Plus, he's ex-police so he knows all about DNA and time of death scenarios.<eos> And he's had all the coppers in his pub so he's had the inside track on everything.<eos> Hiding in plain sight.<eos> More than that... flaunting it.<eos> Telling people he used to give Abigail and Poppy lifts in his car, and it explains the fag end, too.<eos> From the beer garden?<eos> He knew Bates.<eos> He knew exactly what he was up to with Rory, and knew he could set him up.<eos> There he is.<eos> I love you.
Peter Harcross.<eos> He was a local councillor in my hometown, works in Hull now, few years off retirement.<eos> Local government?<eos> This'll get attention.<eos> I want him done for it.<eos> I'm so sorry you've had to live with this.<eos> You've seen me... drug dealers, criminals, I can stand up to them... but... that man...<eos> Paul, please... please come home.<eos> Let's-let's at least try?<eos> Do you know, Helen, right now I can't even look at you.
What is it with this fuckin' guy?<eos> Go in there with Dennis.<eos> Who is that again?<eos> My piping friend.<eos> He knows about our thing.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> I come in peace.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look, um... flat out, son.<eos> I'm starting, frankly, to resent you.
I would just like to know who you really are, you know?<eos> I mean, you seem like two people sometimes. To me.<eos> Good at piping, poor at it, undivided attention, then completely fucking split attention between piping and God knows what.<eos> I just want to know who you really are.<eos> I mean, I know you're John Lakeman, right?<eos> And I know you like John Lakeman, and I don't like John Lakeman.<eos> So, fill in that space for me between what you know about you, and what I know about you, so I can like you, too.<eos> 'Cause I think I will.<eos> Because I'm Leslie Claret, I like Leslie Claret, and I know you don't.<eos> So, I'm gonna fill in that space for you.
The only other thing that I might want to do instead of that right now... is exercise.<eos> Dennis.<eos> Slow down.<eos> Soft boiled eggs, Quiche Lorraine, cold smoked salmon, hot smoked salmon, organic muesli, fresh apricots, Greek yogurt.<eos> Yep. A whole spread.<eos> And let's add some muffins, and breakfast breads, etcetera, to that.<eos> Muffins and breakfast breads, etcetera?<eos> That's right. A whole spread.<eos> Seriously, get away from me, man.<eos> I don't want you around me anymore.
Seriously, get away from me, man.<eos> I don't want you around me anymore.<eos> Dennis, hang in there a little longer, man, and then you can just go back to your normal life.<eos> F you, man.<eos> All these other guys, they cheat on their wives on these trips.<eos> I never did. Ever.<eos> So I wasn't normal. I was excellent.<eos> Now I'm normal, a-hole.<eos> Dennis.<eos> I don't care about you.
I know things about you.<eos> I might get chirpy.<eos> And that'll be a costly tattle.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Where the fuck were you?<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Breakfast.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Shit.<eos> 45 minutes of my time waiting for you.
Breakfast.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Shit.<eos> 45 minutes of my time waiting for you.<eos> I had a whole goddamn spread.<eos> Man, I'm sorry.<eos> - Leslie...<eos> - I've had it with you.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> A man asks you to share a breakfast.
My guess, she shows up tomorrow. They show up at work.<eos> It's safer.<eos> I found the book.<eos> Structural Dynamics of Flow.<eos> Where?<eos> The guy with the girl's name.<eos> - No shit? - No.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Get it to Edward, John.<eos> I may want you out of there. I may pull you out of there.
I'll reach back out to you today.<eos> Okay.<eos> She's good.<eos> She was cited this week for two instances of child neglect for leaving her daughter alone in her apartment.<eos> Her kid's seeing things.<eos> The neighbors narced.<eos> So... she's really cramming in the hours on your case.<eos> She's not a bad mom, I'm guessing;<eos> I'm guessing she's just a good cop.<eos> What does she have on you?

For sure.<eos> You sound "not all in." FYI, I'm a fighter.<eos> And I am fighting for these memories.<eos> So, are you on my team?<eos> Count me in.<eos> Hey, just wanted to give you an update about my life.<eos> You ever stay in the kind of a shitty hotel that has the TV and it's chained to the wall?<eos> Well, that's where I live now. And I look at it, and I think even if I could get the TV off the chain, I couldn't steal it, because I have nowhere to take it because I have no home now.<eos> Hey, John. We got an e-mail.<eos> It was for you.

No matter what happens.<eos> I pull you out of there today,
Well, you did all the heavy lifting, kid.<eos> Well, as the Wolf says in my favorite movie,<eos> "Pulp Fiction", let's not start sucking each other's dicks quite yet.<eos> Show us what you got.<eos> You got what you wanted, man.<eos> Why am I here?<eos> We're not done yet.<eos> I did my part.<eos> What were you gonna do to me with your stupid tree branch?<eos> Brutalize you.
If I blow the whistle, the job you're on... it's over.<eos> Well, you can keep doing the job you're doing, if you do one last thing for me.<eos> Do what?<eos> Tomorrow, some time during the day, at work... Kill me.<eos> People think I'm stupid.<eos> Maybe it's my face.<eos> Name doesn't help, I guess.<eos> You know?<eos> Do I look stupid?<eos> I've never really looked at you.
I was trying to be found guilty.<eos> Wrongful death convictions, the civil settlements are 400 percent greater.<eos> I wanted that family to have something.<eos> Then this judge lets me off.<eos> Thought he was helping me out. Yeah.<eos> In the last 20 years, 17 police officers have been charged for killings for incidents that happened on the job in the U.S. None convicted.<eos> The system's bent, I guess.<eos> Anyway, my insurance expires tomorrow.<eos> Yeah. So kill me at work. 'cause that's another 75,000 for getting killed on the job.<eos> Kill you how?
- Yeah?<eos> I need your help.<eos> Okay.<eos> - He's right inside.<eos> - I can't go inside.<eos> I'm not even supposed to be here.<eos> Will you just tell him?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> How did you even, like, find me or know about me?<eos> He wrote a song about you.

You know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So I thought, I'll just give the kid something simple to do.<eos> We'll start with that.<eos> We'll, uh... We'll build from there.<eos> I'll ask the kid to just draw a little circle.<eos> And maybe, in the simple act of trying his best, maybe he'll win me over with a simple circle.<eos> Here's the impression your little circle made on me, John.<eos> It lacked focus, ambition, clarity, precision, dedication, passion and honesty.<eos> And well, it reminded me of you.
You, too.<eos> Darn.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So you'll field my questions today, Sir?<eos> Well, we had a deal, so...<eos> Yes, we had a deal, sir.<eos> Probably going to be on the later side, is that okay?<eos> Please find time at your earliest convenience.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Hey I Love you
Don't sentimentalise me.<eos> I don't just fly around helping people out.<eos> What are you doing right now?<eos> I happened to be passing by, so I'm mucking in.<eos> You've never passed by in your life.<eos> You couldn't even leave me serving chips, so I'm not going to leave you.<eos> Look at the wall.<eos> - The wall?<eos> - Closely.<eos> Before, when the Vardy, the little microbots, were going to attack you, you asked me where they came from.
This was built by humans, that was built by the Vardy.<eos> Wet brains, dry brains.<eos> Good, old, universally compatible, incorruptible maps.<eos> You are here.<eos> This is the engine room.<eos> That's the target.<eos> That's where I'm going.<eos> - Where am I going?<eos> - You're staying here and you will be guiding me to here, using this map.<eos> I'll hear you through the thingamabob.
- The boy's the one with your magic wand.<eos> - Sonic screwdriver.<eos> - How is that a screwdriver?<eos> - In a very broad sense.<eos> - How's it sonic?<eos> - It makes a noise.<eos> There they are!<eos> Spider! Come on!<eos> Kitty! Come look!<eos> They'll catch you and have you transported!
Kitty...?<eos> Stay back!<eos> Save him.<eos> I can't. He's gone.<eos> Do something... and save him.<eos> I'm sorry about your friend, but the danger isn't over yet.<eos> There must be more of you living rough here - tell me where.<eos> - So, you can take us to the Magistrate?<eos> - No, of course not.<eos> We're not here to arrest you, we're here to help.
There are kids living rough near here, they may well be next on the menu.<eos> Do you want to help me?<eos> Do you want to stand here stamping your foot?<eos> Because let me tell you something. I'm 2,000 years old... and I have never had the time for the luxury of outrage.<eos> What do you mean, "on the menu"?<eos> - Is this where you live?<eos> - For now.<eos> But there's no-one here.<eos> Good work!<eos> Except you, Dot.
Doctor...<eos> Doctor!<eos> Doctor!<eos> Bingo!<eos> What?<eos> I know you!<eos> You're the cheat!<eos> I love your work!<eos> The sound it made...<eos> I couldn't hear you, but that noise... it's like I felt it in my bones, you know?
You're the parent.<eos> You're in charge!<eos> That's it!<eos> Do what I say!<eos> I control you!<eos> No.<eos> It's me.<eos> I control them.<eos> Eliza, finish them now, take them, or you'll die!<eos> They'll destroy you!
You're insane.<eos> No.<eos> I'm quite rational, actually.<eos> Monogamy is not natural.<eos> It is a construct of religious authority.<eos> And a foolish faith in authority, my dear Betty, is the worst enemy of truth.<eos> Truth being that rules don't apply to you?<eos> I love Mozart and Bach.<eos> I love the Swiss Alps and the Baltic Sea.<eos> Why can't I love you and Elsa?
Out.<eos> Boots, pay attention.<eos> Well?<eos> What do you have to say for yourself?<eos> How do people get pleasure by marching in step?<eos> It makes me think they've been given their big brains only by mistake.<eos> Turn around!<eos> Look at me.<eos> I want you to listen to me very carefully, son.<eos> Rebellion will get you nowhere in life.
Oxford.<eos> Princeton. Ha!<eos> I've known you for over a decade, Albert.<eos> You despise British formality, you despise American exceptionalism.<eos> I also despise German nationalism.<eos> So do most Germans.<eos> The country has declared a national holiday for Walther's funeral tomorrow, for God's sake.<eos> Elsa is overreacting.<eos> Do you know what I find extraordinary about you, Fritz Haber?<eos> It might be my brilliant mind or my scintillating wit, but knowing you, you're not about to flatter me.
No, I'm a realist.<eos> And I'm a German patriot, a proud war veteran, and a devout Christian.<eos> Really, Fritz?<eos> You're proud of your military service?<eos> You may have changed your religion, but don't think for a second you can change your heritage.<eos> Is that how you really see me?<eos> As some sort of fraud?<eos> No, no.<eos> It's not how I see you that matters.<eos> It's how men like this Adolf Hitler character see you.
I suppose I will become a teacher in these fields, focusing on the theoretical parts."<eos> Your vocabulary is elementary, the syntax simplistic, you did not use the future simple.<eos> But I think it is an excellent plan.<eos> Welcome to Zurich Polytechnic.<eos> Thank you, sir, thank you.<eos> Good-bye, Albert.<eos> I'm so proud of you.<eos> - Safe travels.<eos> - Albert, come here, son.<eos> Don't let those academic fools in Zurich change you, Albert.
- Thank you for everything. - Oh.<eos> Well have a safe journey.<eos> - Marie, wait!<eos> - Just go, Albert.<eos> Please!<eos> Marie, I'm going to write to you.<eos> And Zurich's not that far.<eos> - I'll visit.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> I am happy for you.
Deb, you found Wags?<eos> No.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> - You do?<eos> - Part of one.<eos> It's not mine.<eos> I overheard it from Mafee... last night.<eos> But he can't know it's from me.<eos> It's sensitive.<eos> He's hiding from you.
You never even have to ask me before writing a check.<eos> No, I don't want to just take it from you.<eos> I want the business to have outside validation.<eos> An actual cap raise.<eos> You sure you're ready?<eos> 'Cause what you're asking, if you're not ready...<eos> I'm ready.<eos> I'll call Boyd. And he'll have the right guy at Spartan-Ives sit with you about expanding.<eos> Lobster?<eos> Yeah, to impress you.
No.<eos> I had heard he's M.I.A. and that the guys here miss him, which surprised me.<eos> What, that he's off the grid or that they miss him?<eos> Anyone could see that he was driving towards a wall like Dale Earnhardt at Daytona.<eos> And what did you do to stop it? No.<eos> No, sir. If a crash is coming, I say you bring it.<eos> It's the only way to get to the other side.<eos> If you survive.<eos> Look, you hired me to help you maximize results, not to coddle the staff.<eos> He hired you. I sort of rubber-stamped it.
It's the only way to get to the other side.<eos> If you survive.<eos> Look, you hired me to help you maximize results, not to coddle the staff.<eos> He hired you. I sort of rubber-stamped it.<eos> And you listen to all of his suggestions?<eos> You said you were surprised that they missed him?<eos> Well, they talk about him like they hate his fucking guts most of the time.<eos> That way they don't hate me.<eos> He's willing to put himself in that spot.<eos> So it's his loyalty that matters to you.
Well, they talk about him like they hate his fucking guts most of the time.<eos> That way they don't hate me.<eos> He's willing to put himself in that spot.<eos> So it's his loyalty that matters to you.<eos> This isn't about me.<eos> You didn't have to walk down here to see if I knew where Wags was, boyo. You could've just called.<eos> You came in here because you want it to be about you. Because you need it to be about you.<eos> And I am here for exactly that purpose. Really?<eos> Let me into that kitchen.<eos> What specific role does Wags serve for you?
Just be there for us when Fugu goes public.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I know when someone's working me.<eos> What's your play here?<eos> The bond.<eos> If your casino is going to the town I need it to.<eos> And because we're friends, I'm gonna come across with that info?<eos> I was hoping.<eos> A '69 Dodge Challenger.<eos> The one I outbid you for at Barrett Jackson last summer?
Turns out, he has early-onset Alzheimer's.<eos> Can't even go out by himself now.<eos> His wife left him.<eos> His kids don't come around.<eos> It was... fucked.<eos> He was there, but he wasn't there... a carcass with no further purpose.<eos> What you saw would have brought up issues of mortality and diminished utility for anyone.<eos> You saw your hero, a man you deemed better than you, laid low.<eos> That's empathy.<eos> Why did his plight cut you so deep?
You have outlived your utility.<eos> There is nothing left for you to do but die.<eos> But you're not dead. Which means it is time to pivot.<eos> To evolve into what it is you'll become next.<eos> Wendy reassembled me, piece by piece, on that bench.<eos> That's what she does.<eos> And I decided I had to give you the chance to make the change here you need to.<eos> To modernize.<eos> To put this old horse out to pasture.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm sorry about Phil, but this place doesn't fucking run without you.
Don't.<eos> I don't have time to have this conversation the way you need me to. You weren't ready.<eos> Leave it there.<eos> Why the fuck not?<eos> What is it that you do that you're the best in the world at?<eos> You offer a service you didn't invent, a formula you didn't invent, a delivery method you didn't invent.<eos> Nothing about what you do is patentable or a unique user experience.<eos> You haven't identified an isolated market segment, haven't truly branded your concept. You need me to go on?<eos> So, why would an investment bank put serious money into it?<eos> I all but told you ahead of time, but you wouldn't listen. Now you've heard it, but it's too late.
They are coming for him.<eos> He'll be in cuffs within the hour.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ready?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Go get 'em.<eos> I will.<eos> Axe.<eos> Let's do dinner again soon with Savannah and Mike.<eos> When we're on, I have to get into all the action against you on the Nigerian play.
Their economy is on the verge of collapse. Their oil reserves are severely overvalued. In short, their currency is in jeopardy.<eos> And so, yes, there is no doubt in my mind that my good friend, Bobby Axelrod, has this one right.<eos> The Nigerian currency, the Naira, is facing certain devaluation.<eos> It's their only choice, no matter how much it hurts the people.<eos> I can see that.<eos> We nailed that.<eos> The old Malachi Crunch.<eos> The market is shifting already. It is done.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Larry... in a few moments, the FBI are gonna come walking through that door and they're going to arrest you.
As far as I know.<eos> Where was she taken?<eos> Tell me where she is.<eos> Please.<eos> What are you thinking about?<eos> Dieppe. You.<eos> Standing on top of that tank on fire.<eos> Not you.<eos> The best part of that was the view.<eos> Seeing that jeep at the far end of the field carrying you back.
Nevertheless.<eos> What's the occasion?<eos> My promotion to brigadefuhrer.<eos> For my contribution to our success at dieppe.<eos> From the man himself?<eos> I see.<eos> Well, the thing is, if sabine talked, It doesn't matter if you're back for that call or not.<eos> Trust my team.<eos> They will figure out where we stand.<eos> We'll get you back in time if it's safe.
Meet you back here.<eos> I know it's hard, But maybe we should look for a silver lining.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, it sounds wrong. To say this but... Maybe it's for the best.<eos> Poor ulli, he wasn't well.<eos> He wasn't sick.<eos> No, no, of course... What I mean is... Despite all the love...<eos> Mongoloids never develop normally. And when you think about the future, What would it have been?<eos> For him?<eos> For you?
Previously on x company...<eos> Jacques rigaud, We will execute these prisoners. One by one until you step forward.<eos> We have friends.<eos> We can keep you safe.
Lives were lost. To get this man here.<eos> Put aside your differences and.<eos> Listen to what he has to say.<eos> And who are you?<eos> Do you know what happened at dieppe?<eos> The russians bring real men,<eos> Real weapons.<eos> Were you there?<eos> Thousands of men cut down on french soil.<eos> For you.
Our protocol's secure.<eos> That's not what I mean.<eos> We've developed a very...<eos> Delicate relationship. That requires discretion.<eos> I'm gonna need you to be the middle man.<eos> You want me to pass messages. Between you and faber?<eos> Off the record. I don't understand.<eos> Aurora's his handler.<eos> Which is why I don't want her to feel undermined. That faber and I are communicating.<eos> I'm sorry to put you in this position again, Where you know more than the others but I trust you, alfred.
So free, Even in the face of death.<eos> I didn't know her name, But she reminded me. That the reason we fight,<eos> I'll let you work.<eos> Neil.<eos> Less than three hours to go.<eos> We gotta get this into place.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> Her name was miri.<eos> I got your telegram.<eos> I didn't expect to hear from you until this was all over.
Our superiors do not. Understand the situation in france.<eos> They are not here on the ground.<eos> I did not rise to my rank by playing by the rules.<eos> This is something you will come to understand. As you advance your career.<eos> You are a very promising young officer, edsel, And I would like to continue to see you rise.<eos> For that to happen, our relationship needs.<eos> To be one built on trust. Of course.<eos> You will be held responsible for this.<eos> The prisoner fled under your watch. However,<eos> You will receive full credit for the prevention. Of his escape, and I will protect you. From any punishment.

Einstein, say hello to Mileva Maric.<eos> Thank you, Papa, she's so beautiful.<eos> She makes such lovely colors.<eos> It's called refraction.<eos> All the colors are there, inside the light.<eos> The glass just pulls it apart so we can see.<eos> Did they teach you that in school?<eos> We don't learn about science in school.<eos> I found it in a book.<eos> What ever will become of you, my brilliant Mileva?
No!<eos> There will be no discussion.<eos> Well, no man ever married a woman for her mind, hmm?<eos> Marija...<eos> Don't worry, Mama.<eos> I won't need to marry.<eos> I plan to be a scientist.<eos> Oh, my beautiful daughter.<eos> What a joy it is, to celebrate your birth.<eos> Seems any day now, we will be losing you to another man.
Marija...<eos> Don't worry, Mama.<eos> I won't need to marry.<eos> I plan to be a scientist.<eos> Oh, my beautiful daughter.<eos> What a joy it is, to celebrate your birth.<eos> Seems any day now, we will be losing you to another man.<eos> But we could do worse than you, Albert.<eos> Not much.<eos> Ow. Who knew inviting you into our home those years back, we would expand our merry band so exponentially?
Our pleasure.<eos> - Take a breath, son, there's plenty of time.<eos> Well, Miss Winteler.<eos> I do hope you'll return sooner rather than later, Mr. Besso.<eos> Oh, look it, you're blushing.<eos> I could make the trip to Milan.<eos> Maybe...<eos> But Grossmann's family have a house on a lake and I've been invited to join them.<eos> So... I do enjoy sailing.<eos> Albert, you would tell me if something was troubling you.
Oh, Jesus, save me.<eos> Albert, please.<eos> Albert.<eos> What?<eos> Your fiancée.<eos> I want the sordid details.<eos> I don't understand how you all arrived at this notion that we're engaged.<eos> I can't understand your reluctance.<eos> She is beautiful, she is kind.<eos> And she loves you so deeply.
Stop.<eos> But Marie, it's not... She's...<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I can't.<eos> This is not a possibility.<eos> But why not?<eos> You both look ruddy.<eos> Seems the summer holiday - has treated you well.<eos> - In my mind, I'm still on a sailboat with schnapps in hand.<eos> The Wintelers had hoped to see you in Aarau.

I think that's what I'm gonna call you.<eos> My little Dollie.<eos> You think I look funny?<eos> No.<eos> Why would you...?<eos> This is not a joke to me.<eos> Hey, I wasn't...<eos> You were.<eos> Hear me, Albert.<eos> If this is just... shaking the sheets for you, then you must let me be.
You were right.<eos> I was careless.<eos> It really has been over with Marie for some time, but... I just... I didn't want to hurt her, so I... didn't say anything at all.<eos> But it's done now.<eos> I've made it clear.<eos> And... as unfair as I was to her, I've been ten times more so to you.<eos> I was... I've been horrid and selfish and you're right to want nothing more to do with me.<eos> Those are Marcel's notes.<eos> The last two terms.<eos> I copied them for you.
By the skin of your teeth, of course.<eos> Good day.<eos> Dollie.<eos> Miza!<eos> Hello, Papa.<eos> So wonderful to see you.<eos> - I've missed you, too.<eos> - Did you?<eos> Your mother and I were beginning to worry you'd never come home.<eos> In all your letters, you never explained what has kept you these months.
What is it?<eos> It's in Bern at the patent office.<eos> Um, clerical position, but very interesting work.<eos> You could employ some of your engineering knowledge.<eos> I'm a scientist, Marcel!<eos> I'm better than a clerkship.<eos> - You need money.<eos> - I need a thought, a paper that can show people what I can do; I need time.<eos> No, you need a job.<eos> Why not ask your father could he set you up in the factory in Milan?
And it seems to me, if you apologize for your boorish behavior, you may have a chance to win her back.<eos> Mother, you know very well that I have someone else now.<eos> What?<eos> That creature in the photo you sent?<eos> - She isn't even Jewish.<eos> - Neither is Marie.<eos> Well, at least she isn't Slavic.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - Mother.<eos> - Be... She'll be the end of you, - Albert.
But what is the ether?<eos> What kind of substance has such remarkable properties?<eos> One has to twist all of physics into knots just to make it work, but it must exist, or else...<eos> Are you a Jew?<eos> I subscribe to no religion.<eos> You look like a Jew.<eos> Are you sliced?<eos> Down there?<eos> Does it feel odd to fornicate if you're sliced?<eos> Timo, your father isn't paying me to tutor you about the ins and outs of... about girls, but if you'll indulge me, I'll show you that mathematics is as elegant as the finest of women, and just like women, it might seem intimidating at first, but the truth is anyone can do it.
You didn't come to be with me, you came to use me to help you with math.<eos> No, I was...<eos> Why did I expect any different?<eos> You-you write page after page about work in your letters, but you almost never ask about me.<eos> - I search endlessly for some caring emotion like a pig digging for truffles, but I never find it.<eos> At least I know my father was right about one thing.<eos> - You're too damn selfish to be a good husband.<eos> I've defended you to everyone.<eos> And now I feel like a fool.<eos> None of them have ever met you, and yet they saw you more clearly than I did.
What are you saying?<eos> I'm fairly certain I just said it.<eos> Don't act like you want to marry me.<eos> I know you don't.<eos> I missed the train because I was distracted.<eos> I couldn't wait to share my ideas with you.<eos> Not because they promise glory for me, but because... it was like peeking through a keyhole to our future.<eos> The two of us. Huh?<eos> Mileva... you're the love of my life.<eos> And I will do the right thing for you and this child.
A newborn child, cawing, soiling herself left and right.<eos> Sleepless nights, chaotic days.<eos> A late rent payment, a haggard wife, nagging her untidy husband...<eos> - Maurice...<eos> - Stay with me now.<eos> This is where it turns naughty.<eos> Your colleagues.<eos> Can you see them?<eos> Huh? Men of inferior intellect.<eos> But untethered by family, they go zipping past you at the speed of light.
My father became ill so fast.<eos> If I had had any idea...<eos> When I saw her being lowered into the ground... it was like a piece of me was torn away.<eos> A piece of me buried alongside her.<eos> And I knew the only person who could fill that void... is you.<eos> And I hate you for that.<eos> Go on hating me if you choose.<eos> I know I deserve it.<eos> And I know I...<eos> I don't deserve you.
I know I deserve it.<eos> And I know I...<eos> I don't deserve you.<eos> But I will never feel anything but love for you, Mileva.<eos> Marry me, Dollie.<eos> I know it might only be a humble life I have to offer, but... it's a good life.<eos> And if we're together, then it couldn't possibly be anything else.<eos> It's only the very first Nobel.<eos> You will win the next one.<eos> I believe in you, Philipp.
Do you remember when you dug a trench in the snow, covered it with a canvas and declared it your winter palace?<eos> I wanted to sleep there. But mama wouldn't have it.<eos> You were always so independent, Miza. So strong.<eos> You seem happy again.<eos> I am.<eos> And what about resuming your studies?<eos> I'm working with Albert every day, exploring the most fascinating topics in physics.<eos> I don't need a degree for that.<eos> And that's really enough for you?<eos> What's bothering you, papa?
Our marriage is not a business transaction!<eos> You are not a prized heifer to be bought and sold.<eos> That's very noble of you, Albert, but your lofty principles will not help me cook, clean, and raise a child all while midwifing your papers.<eos> Pick up the baby, Albert!<eos> How are we to manage?<eos> Do you think I don't already have a solution to that problem, dear Dollie?<eos> I will ask my mother to come.<eos> She knows how to run a household, how to care for a child, she will make it possible for you and<eos> I to continue our work. She despises me.<eos> She doesn't even know you.
It's as if I am...<eos> Invisible?<eos> Perhaps my mother's right.<eos> It's time to put away such indulgences and concentrate on what's expected of me.<eos> Einstein, I need yesterday's...<eos> Yesterday's, today's and tomorrow's.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Albert?<eos> Albert? I'm worried about you...
No.<eos> O God, who brought us to birth, and in whose arms we die, in our grief and shock comfort us;<eos> Give us hope in our confusion and grace to enter a new life; Through Jesus Christ.<eos> Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> That poor family.<eos> I should be at the funeral.<eos> You are free to go, Frau Einstein.<eos> No, no, my dear.<eos> I couldn't possibly leave you alone with the child.
Go, go where?<eos> Home.<eos> If you think this creature can make you happy, then I promise you, son, you are in for a life of misery.<eos> He won't sleep.<eos> I don't know what to do...<eos> I can take him.<eos> Thank you...<eos> I made you something.<eos> It's a train, yes.<eos> I was on one of these this morning, and I couldn't wait to get home to see you.
It's a good thing we're leaving tonight, or I would've told the whole hospital.<eos> That's great news.<eos> You gonna tell Charlie?<eos> I thought he was coming.<eos> Well, he had work to do and I... I kind of wanted to be alone for this.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah. I'm fine.<eos> Fine... but, uh, more importantly, what about you?<eos> You know, big move...<eos> Any job prospects for you over there?
Yes, I would love that.<eos> Also, could you sign this consent form for a full blood panel?<eos> Right here.<eos> And I'll get my C.D. from the car.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, I started to think you found a better offer and bailed on me.<eos> No.<eos> Why would you think that?<eos> I'm just kidding. Relax.<eos> Let me fill you in.
Never mind.<eos> Well, Zach doesn't strike me as a deceptive type.<eos> Oh, here we go...<eos> Bro code, right?<eos> I'm the crazy girlfriend making stuff up in my head.<eos> No, it's...<eos> That's awesome.<eos> No, it's just that...<eos> You know, sometimes you have to give people the benefit of the doubt.<eos> If he's keeping something from you,
We're gonna let the heparin keep working its magic, and we'll be back to check on you in a bit.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Dr. Lin, a word.<eos> You knew about this staff position?<eos> I heard about it this morning, but it's not for me.<eos> Nothing's changed.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Everything has changed.<eos> Maggie, I can't be the person who takes you away from this opportunity so you can start all over again.

And I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop, and then it did.<eos> What happened?<eos> Uh, brain aneurysm...<eos> in the dining room.<eos> Now you see him, now you don't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I threw myself into my work.<eos> I thought maybe if I work hard enough on the magic act, maybe...<eos> You could see him again?<eos> And then I meet you, and you got the magic, man!
Why didn't you just tell me that?<eos> I didn't want to hurt your feelings.<eos> So you lied to me?<eos> No, I...<eos> Look, Dawn.<eos> You are so amazing with them.<eos> It's...<eos> But you're not their mother.<eos> Look.<eos> They just don't know you like I know you, and they just need a little bit of time.
Well, after the surgery, there's a chance your mother might not remember how to play the piano.<eos> Then that's a deal-breaker.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> Let's hear him out.<eos> It's not permanent.<eos> Cognition could revert back in a few months.<eos> You would need someone patient to help you relearn while the brain recovers from surgery.<eos> The music comes from here.<eos> And that's where you live.<eos> The most beautiful pieces I wrote, I wrote to you.
I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm pregnant, so I sold it.<eos> No one saw that coming.<eos> Okay, not enough time.<eos> Keys!<eos> How am I supposed to get home?<eos> Hitch a ride with Dawn.<eos> It's not gonna happen.<eos> I'm never gonna see you again.<eos> Your going to England, Lin, not Mars.<eos> I love you.
I wish I could decide which one I'm listening to.<eos> You showed me not to be afraid of mine, not to mention a thing or two in the O.R.<eos> There are no words.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You're not getting rid of me that easily.<eos> We are coming to visit.<eos> You better.<eos> Or we won't make it, and you'll be stuck with me forever.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> I'm gonna get you there dead or alive, preferably alive.
No one's been... avoiding you.<eos> It's just...<eos> It's been a busy day.<eos> Listen, you died.<eos> That doesn't mean you weren't loved or you won't be missed.<eos> I'm just scared.<eos> I know.<eos> But I don't know what happens next.<eos> You just think of someone you love and hope for the best... Duder.<eos> - Love you!

- Love you!<eos> - Love you!<eos> Bye!<eos> Bye!<eos> Sydney: Hey, stranger.<eos> I thought you left.<eos> I did want to get on that plane.<eos> I was so mad and disappointed.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No, no, no, not at you... at myself for pushing you away.
I'm so glad you came.<eos> I got your letter.<eos> I think the first word is "Shalom."<eos> Yeah.<eos> But it's really hard to find someone who reads Hebrew.<eos> Yeah, 'cause there's no Jewish doctors working at a hospital.<eos> Nope.<eos> I was standing in that office, and it was everything I'd worked for.<eos> And all I could think about was you.<eos> I love you.
And all I could think about was you.<eos> I love you.<eos> And I'd give everything up to be with you.<eos> I would, too.<eos> That's why I didn't get on the plane.<eos> I guess we both gave it all up.<eos> You want to know what that says?<eos> "Shalom, Maggie."<eos> "From the Book of Ruth...<eos> 'Urge me not to leave you.'"
- Oh. I... I thought those days were behind you.<eos> Honey...<eos> Listen.<eos> I just got to do this one more time, okay?<eos> Don't you trust me? Oh, yes, of course I trust you.<eos> I'm just worried about what might happen.<eos> - What's gonna happen? - Well, what if you're hungover?<eos> - Hmm? - Hmm? What if those shoes give you blisters?<eos> Listen, don't you worry that pretty little head about those things, all right?<eos> - I love you.
- Got a good grip? - Yep.<eos> Hold on for the ride of your life.<eos> Dearest Margaret, the canvas ripped again.<eos> At times, it seems my dream of building an all-canvas shoe may never come to pass.<eos> But, as ever, I toil on.<eos> With everlasting love, Archibald Converse.<eos> Converse.<eos> Like the shoe!<eos> I think we lost them.<eos> I couldn't have done this without you.
He didn't propose 'cause he didn't want to.<eos> 'Cause I... I suck.<eos> Oh, no, I would not make such a bold conclusion.<eos> Mm-hmm, I have a weird nose and split ends and I don't play an instrument. I don't pay attention to current events, and I'm a sad, weird, annoying girl and I wouldn't wanna marry me either.<eos> There we go.<eos> Mystery solved.<eos> Case closed. It seems your powers of deduction are clouded by insecurity. He was clearly nervous.<eos> Shut the [bleep] up, Watson, you stupid sack of shit!<eos> What do you even do?<eos> If I fired you right now, what would it say on your résumé?
- Yeah, right.<eos> Well, maybe there's a reason you're hesitating.<eos> - Maybe you don't wanna marry me.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Lucy, I do want to marry you.<eos> If you really wanted to propose, Josh, you would have done it already.<eos> Well, excuse me for trying to be romantic, all right.<eos> There's a lot of pressure.<eos> I-I just... I just want<eos> - the timing to be right. - How about right now?<eos> Does right now work for you as a time?
Move, move!<eos> It's not worth it!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Well, hello!<eos> Is this for me?<eos> Josh is getting married?<eos> Take cover!<eos> Well, this is just great news.<eos> Ah! Congratulations on the wonderful news.<eos> We are both so happy for you.
Oh, what... Yeah!<eos> Uh, uh, the whales.<eos> Right.<eos> Um, every day, four whales are killed, and that's way too many, so, uh, you know, donate to that shit.<eos> I want to thank Cameron Crowe!<eos> I want to thank Tom Cruise!<eos> And I want to thank Josh!<eos> He's my best friend in the whole wide world.<eos> We've been through everything, brother.<eos> - I love you, brother.
- How's life on the outside?<eos> - It's fine. Uh, I just, uh, finished an episode of Shark Tank.<eos> This guy pitched these socks that you can kinda draw on, so, like-like, you can, like, customize the socks and, like, write things on the socks... like, if you're on a team...<eos> Oh, God... I'm sorry.<eos> Did you want me to wait?<eos> No, no, you... you need to live your life.<eos> From now on, just pretend I'm dead.<eos> Don't talk like that. You don't know what it's like in here.<eos> You don't know what it's like.<eos> What's that mark on your face? Josh, did someone hurt you?
- Michael!<eos> - Thank you, Mikey.<eos> - What?<eos> I didn't know Mike played baseball.<eos> I mean, he played softball at middle school, and he was terrible.<eos> Okay, um...<eos> Uh, Lucy, I know we still have, like, wedding stuff to do, but...<eos> Josh, Josh, this is important, okay?<eos> - Go to Chattanooga.<eos> I love you!
Ah, she's also a scientist.<eos> She studied physics, yes.<eos> And now?<eos> I think, of all the mysteries in the universe, people are the hardest for me to fathom.<eos> But my wife is really quite brilliant.<eos> Have you been with someone in Brussels?<eos> With someone?<eos> What... what, what do you mean?<eos> This woman.<eos> Did she meet you there?
And needless to say, you'll not be driving your taxi today, will you, pet?<eos> - Poor bloke.<eos> - Ah.<eos> His own son turning his back on him.<eos> If my lad ever did that to me, I don't know what I'd do.<eos> What did you do?<eos> At university?<eos> Business studies.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Never had you down as an Alan Sugar.
Rory would never hurt anyone.<eos> Kenny?<eos> I need you to find Rory Marston and bring him in.<eos> 'What's the charge, ma'am?<eos> ' Well, what do you think?<eos> The murder of Jamie Marshall.<eos> Rory, you need to stop running.<eos> You can't run from this, son.<eos> I'm here for you... .. but you can't do this on your own.<eos> 'I love you, no matter what.'
Previously on AMC's "Preacher"...<eos> He says that he is dying, that he wants to live forever.<eos> And he thinks that you can help him do that.<eos> There. If I could just magnify that, I could find out whose hand it is.<eos> I'm gonna put you in holding with the others.
They made me a custodian.<eos> I had free run of the place.<eos> I saw things.<eos> I learned how they think.<eos> Someone gets out of Hell to tell the tale?<eos> Never.<eos> _<eos> Listen to me, Eugene.<eos> Hell is more than Zagnuts and flat basketballs.<eos> There are other places they can put you.
I loved it.<eos> Christ, I can't remember the last time I was on a beach.<eos> Yup.<eos> Me neither.<eos> I hate the beach.<eos> And there's the boredom.<eos> You've heard every joke...<eos> Drugs barely work.<eos> And then everyone you ever cared or loved just... Just dies.<eos> Except you.
God.<eos> Eugene!<eos> I didn't know you were here!<eos> Preacher.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Tracy tells me you got a big chemistry test coming up this week.<eos> You gonna be ready?<eos> I... Yeah, I-I think so.<eos> Good.<eos> That goes for you too, Tracy.
Hard to recuperate when you're inhaling the smell of your own sick.<eos> My God.<eos> Alright.<eos> Let me get that for you.<eos> Papa?<eos> Papa, please.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> You had to see for yourself.<eos> You had to see.<eos> Once they find out you are the mistake, that is where they will put you.
Nobody.<eos> It's just me.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Um, I'm just going 'round all the apartments and fixing up the holes.<eos> If you want.<eos> I-I thought you were my ex.<eos> Come... Come on in.<eos> God...<eos> I don't know why I'm praying when I know you're not there, but... if this is your plan for me, and you can hear me,<eos> I gave up a piece of my soul to find you.
It's a religious organization with designs on world domination.<eos> He says that he is dying, that he wants to live forever.<eos> He thinks that you can help him do that.<eos> Time's up.<eos> How'd you sleep?<eos> I dreamed about him again.<eos> Again.<eos> Whatever Custer's got, it's for real.<eos> Kick him up to Samson Unit.<eos> Jesse... much bigger things are coming for you.
People do whatever he says.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think I'm bored.<eos> What kind of world is it when a woman obeying a man is seen as a superpower?<eos> I have a date.<eos> Kill them all.<eos> Lord, I call upon you to strengthen us, light our way through the darkness, and protect us in this holy mission.<eos> Amen.<eos> - Amen. - Amen.<eos> Love you, man.
Hold the butter in your hand.<eos> Not the tray...<eos> The butter.<eos> Take it in your hand.<eos> Tuck it under your chin.<eos> Tuck... it under your chin.<eos> Now, listen carefully.<eos> In the general ballpark, how long can you hold your breath?<eos> Never mind.<eos> I love you.
Put your trust in us and we shall repay that trust for you.<eos> Turn it. Spin it.<eos> Spin the camera!<eos> Spin the camera!<eos> Jason, come on!<eos> It's ready.<eos> Surprise...<eos> Tea first, then presents, OK?<eos> OK.<eos> ♪ Happy birthday to you

That's hard to remember.<eos> Like it never happened.<eos> But it did, didn't it?<eos> Emma?<eos> He actually ate something today, which is good.<eos> How's work?<eos> Defending any more sex offenders or mad mullahs?<eos> We all have a right to a lawyer, Mum.<eos> Yes, but why does it always have to be you?<eos> I'm worried about you, Em.
Working hard?<eos> I'm afraid I woke Miriam.<eos> - Oh, no...<eos> - No, no, don't worry.<eos> Not the kid, though.<eos> How long are they gonna be camping on our couch?<eos> Until I can find them another place to live.<eos> How was the pub?<eos> You were missed.<eos> Love you.
Outside Kevin Russell's little hut.<eos> Where did you find this?<eos> Who took it?<eos> You'll learn soon enough.<eos> Ah, here comes the man himself.<eos> You let a terrorist's wife live in your home and you set a murderer free.<eos> You play with fire.<eos> - Derek's outside with the car.<eos> - Good luck out there, Kevin.<eos> We'll take you straight to the hotel.
Don't worry about Russell.<eos> It's fixed.<eos> - How?<eos> - I used the photographs.<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> The photos show what Russell is.<eos> They'll put him back where he belongs.<eos> They could also expose other things.<eos> Yes, they could.<eos> I appreciate how embarrassing that would be for you.
- Yes?<eos> - 'You should turn on your TV.'<eos> - What is it, sir?<eos> - 'You overplayed your hand.<eos> You need to move Pullings, right now.'<eos> '.. nude photographs of the murdered teenager Linda Simms.<eos> Also revealed is the identity of the man who allegedly took the photos, Tony Pullings.'<eos> Hello.<eos> 'You're blown.<eos> I'm moving you now somewhere safe.'
Why is Tony Pullings crawling out of the woodwork?<eos> Where are you hiding him?<eos> I know nothing about Pullings.<eos> So get out... .. before I really lose my temper.<eos> Hello, Tony.<eos> How long is this going on for?<eos> Until the retrial.<eos> That's months.<eos> Weeks.<eos> Until then, we have to keep you away from Banville and your colleagues in the press.
What about the other girls?<eos> Irrelevant.<eos> Unless you raped or killed one of them. You didn't, did you?<eos> No.<eos> That is a relief.<eos> Do what I say.<eos> Russell will be back where he belongs and you can get on with your life.<eos> OK?<eos> I know who you're protecting.<eos> Yeah, I'm protecting you, Tony.
Seriously?<eos> That bird has flown.<eos> And it will backfire on Banville.<eos> As for the Coroner, ordinary decent common sense will prevail.<eos> My involvement...<eos> You do realise what else is going on here?<eos> A leadership contest which you'll only win if you pull the union and youth vote from that Trotskyite dickhead you're against.<eos> And who did you let walk out that door, disappointed and angry?<eos> An ex-shop steward with serious heft in the movement.<eos> You think he's going to support you now?
All these holes in Greenwood's investigation.<eos> I don't envy you trying to fill them.<eos> And all this will come out in court.<eos> Sorry I took so long.<eos> Emma.<eos> Be careful what you say.<eos> They're probably listening.<eos> No touching.<eos> How long do we have to stay here?<eos> Under the Terrorism Act, they can hold you up to 14 days without charge.
No.<eos> Couldn't get near him.<eos> Two big lads on the door, minding the gate.<eos> But I did find this.<eos> From what I remember, I was hit by a grey van.<eos> Look at the front bumper.<eos> It's dented.<eos> The van's registered to a company in the Channel Islands, but who controls them and what they do, I couldn't find out.<eos> What if Pullings sold his story to a newspaper and these boys have been sent to baby-sit him?<eos> What, they nearly kill you because of an exclusive?
Without an autopsy?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He's sleeping now.<eos> But he was asking for you.<eos> Quite upset.<eos> Probably heard about your latest headlines.<eos> It would be nice if you could try not to make his last days awful.<eos> What do you want me to do, Mum?<eos> Do you want me to stop doing what I believe in, what I'm actually good at?<eos> I want not to worry about you all the time.
Where's the SIM card she gave you?<eos> I'll give it to my client, no one else.<eos> Where is it now?<eos> - Where's the SIM card?<eos> - No idea.<eos> Why's Tony Pullings crawling out of the woodwork?<eos> He stopped me in the street, asked me if I wanted to be famous.<eos> I know nothing about Tony Pullings.<eos> Yeah, well, I know who you're protecting.<eos> I'm protecting you, Tony.
Old reliable, cleaning up the Brits' mess.<eos> Not just our mess.<eos> In fact, primarily, not our mess.<eos> Soon we won't be able to do this, you know?<eos> Secret assignations.<eos> You'll be far too well known.<eos> I doubt it.<eos> Don't doubt it.<eos> You'll win.<eos> Which is why I wanted to see you.
Where was Logan going away to?<eos> Iraq.<eos> Where'd you bloody think?<eos> What was his last name?<eos> Tony?<eos> What was his last name?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Tony, please.<eos> His last name.<eos> Now, we can protect you.
His last name.<eos> Now, we can protect you.<eos> You can't.<eos> And I don't know his last name, she never said it.<eos> We have a first name, we know he was with an F16 squadron and we know when he was at RAF Crawbury.<eos> We can identify him.<eos> And I know a man who can track him down.<eos> And then what?<eos> And then I'm gonna go to America and I'm gonna talk to that son of a bitch.<eos> With your record and your clients, you think the Americans will let you in?
Thanks.<eos> On what grounds?<eos> Sit down.<eos> I'll take it from here.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> Thanks, Jenna.<eos> I hate subterfuge.<eos> However...<eos> What is this?<eos> It was the only way we could think to get you out of the States.
No!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Now!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> You saw Linda that night, didn't you?<eos> You gave her a lift to the base.<eos> Where did you take her?<eos> Just say it.<eos> Or I'll kill you... right here.
You know, if you hadn't tried to fix it back then, we wouldn't be where we are now.<eos> No, you'd be in jail.<eos> Don't give her the time of day.<eos> She's got you scared, hasn't she?<eos> One little lawyer.<eos> One unreconstructed leftie lawyer.<eos> Have you been drinking?<eos> Goodbye, Heather.<eos> From now on, I'd take care of myself.<eos> There are others more important than you.
You bring them home.<eos> Miriam's not the first terrorist to sleep in the living room.<eos> Kevin's not the first murderer to sleep in the office.<eos> They're your children.<eos> You'll never give them up.<eos> Don't kid yourself.<eos> And I know I'm lazy.<eos> But I'm good for you.<eos> You can relax with me, have a laugh.<eos> And I love you.
Because God tried them and found them worthy of himself.<eos> I told you we should have kept her locked up in the States.<eos> If we'd kept her here, she would have become the story.<eos> Which would have meant even more questions, wouldn't it?<eos> You heard she got to Alastair?<eos> Yes.<eos> To what effect?<eos> None.<eos> Alastair kept his nerve.<eos> Everyone has to keep their nerve, including you.
Don't let another innocent person suffer.<eos> OK.<eos> You need to come with me.<eos> I have diplomatic immunity.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Hello, little man.<eos> Thank you, Emma.<eos> You did good.<eos> 'I'm here.<eos> I'll catch you.
The industrialist?<eos> You think he would pay for the expedition?<eos> He fancies himself an intellectual, and he funds the Prussian Academy.<eos> Why not go directly to the source?<eos> Can you arrange a meeting?<eos> Only on the condition that I accompany you.<eos> You can't bear to be away from me.<eos> True, but I also know you're not always as adept at social niceties as you are with equations.<eos> I can help iron the inevitable wrinkles.<eos> What would I do without you?
I need to think of my daughters.<eos> What happens to them if I become the object of ridicule?<eos> What about your family?<eos> Mileva's furious with me regardless of.<eos> We've certainly given her reason.<eos> She doesn't know.<eos> Even so, she is not the monster you made her out to be.<eos> Does she deserve the scorn that will surely be heaped upon her if word spreads?<eos> Do your boys?<eos> Elsa, I moved my family to Berlin for you.

Are you in love with her?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Do you know where I was last night?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> I went to a hotel. To meet a man.<eos> A man who finds me fascinating, who takes pleasure in my company.<eos> Who was he?<eos> The mathematician from Zagreb, but I couldn't.<eos> Perhaps you should have.<eos> Do I really mean so little to you? Dollie.
There is no sin in drifting apart, only in punishing each other for it.<eos> I want a divorce.<eos> She refused.<eos> Why are you so intent on a divorce, anyway?<eos> Why not do what the rest of us do?<eos> Take a mistress.<eos> There's been no talk of divorce under my roof.<eos> Elsa won't see me as things stand.<eos> She certainly won't resume our relations as long as I'm still married.<eos> Elsa means that much to you?
Go, let's go, go, go.<eos> Mileva, Erwin's been freed in exchange for Russian prisoners.<eos> Thank God.<eos> I know. Isn't it wonderful?<eos> And the photographs?<eos> Perhaps it's a blessing.<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> Your foundation for general relativity is flawed.<eos> What?<eos> Whatever would lead you to such a conclusion?
How were either of us to know the kaiser would declare war on Russia?<eos> You wanted me to fail.<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, somewhere deep within me I wanted to see the look on your face when you experienced real pain.<eos> Disappointment.<eos> The harsh judgement of the world.<eos> I wanted to see those dreams crumble for you as they have for me.<eos> You hate me that much?<eos> I don't hate you.<eos> I hate the person I've become because of you.
Let's get our seats.<eos> Mileva, Mileva, Mileva, don't do this.<eos> It's already done, Albert.<eos> You don't have to go all the way to Switzerland.<eos> It will be easier for everyone. You can't.<eos> You pushed so hard.<eos> Now you have what you wanted.<eos> I wanted to end our marriage.<eos> I didn't want to lose my whole family.<eos> The move to Berlin was for you.
Yo, Tariq!<eos> You all right, St. Patrick? Yeah.<eos> You know, we lost an inmate last year just like this, weights slipped on his neck and crushed his windpipe.<eos> He was a cop killer, just like you. Piece of shit.<eos> What you lookin' over there for, man?<eos> The cameras don't work, son.<eos> They ain't worked in over a year.<eos> Too bad, though, if they did.<eos> Maybe they'd find out how the weights slipped on the last nigga here.<eos> Ain't nobody give a fuck about you while you up in here.
Well, then un-confuse them.<eos> Look, man, I pull these kids out of the hood; I give 'em life skills for the real world.<eos> So you're Mother Teresa.<eos> In Armani.<eos> No, no, he's a one-man homeboy industry.<eos> That's a good play.<eos> Speaking of play, Joe, what about the gun found at Truth?<eos> Can't we get that thrown out?<eos> - That's our intention. - Okay.<eos> Yes, but if we file that motion and the prosecution connects you to that gun in any way, we're done.
He told you about that?<eos> I figured it out.<eos> Right after that woman tried to kill him at Truth, he came over and he told me he needed more time for us to be together.<eos> Later, I realized what he needed was you.<eos> All that time we spent meeting up, sleeping together and... he was coming home to you.<eos> Are you trying to get me to slap the fuck out of you?<eos> No, I'm saying he lied to us both, used us both, because we let him, because he could.<eos> Did Jamie tell you we offered him a deal?<eos> Yeah, he told me.<eos> So he told you that we came to him and I showed him that we could charge you as an accomplice, that we could eventually put you in jail?

If I were you, I'd be thinking about being on my own damn side.<eos> Yo, man, a primera drop-off?<eos> That shit ain't optional, homey.<eos> Where the fuck were you?<eos> I was just taking care of some club shit, man.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Just chill.<eos> I'll be at the next one.<eos> Here. Yeah, you will.<eos> Yo, what's this shit you tellin' Tommy I was in with the Feds longer than you?
- Sit down. - Okay.<eos> Come on, man. What you doing?<eos> It's all there.<eos> I don't know you, kid.<eos> All I know is my friend's information must be good.<eos> You showing up tells me that.<eos> All I know is that my boy inside gots kids.<eos> We just want to make sure nothing fucks up his case.<eos> I guess you didn't go the extra mile for Teresi.<eos> So why didn't the Feds ever pick you up?
All right, yo, I'll keep him drinking, but y'all need to hurry the fuck up.<eos> All right. Get the door, man.<eos> You went out to Teresi's?<eos> Everything I saw, everything I heard.<eos> You can get that to Ghost?<eos> Yeah, I'm his lawyer.<eos> I can sneak it in.<eos> And before you say it, I'm being your lawyer too. - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> In fact, I got a meeting with a Homeland Security Agent tomorrow night who says he has evidence against you.
I think the Ruiz recording may have surfaced.<eos> And it's not good.<eos> The prosecution has it, huh?<eos> A Homeland Security Agent.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Look, if Mak had it, he'd be introducing it in court right after announcing a RICO action against you and Tommy. He's not doing that.<eos> You do the math for me.<eos> What does all that mean?<eos> I don't know. I'm meeting with the Homeland guy.<eos> I'll know more tomorrow, but... if this recording does directly incriminate you, there may only be one way out of this mess. It's not happening, come on. You know that, yo.
We both implicated.<eos> So... gettin' Ghost to flip on me ain't really an option for you no more.<eos> Is it?<eos> So, let me ask you something.<eos> Ghost set that up?<eos> Ruiz recording me talking?<eos> That was his little plan?<eos> James knew about the recording.<eos> That's why he broke into Knox's apartment to find it.<eos> To save you.
All right.<eos> You better do it.<eos> What about him?<eos> I'll take care of him too.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Not by myself.<eos> I know a guy.<eos> Hey, Proctor.<eos> You all right.<eos> I'm glad I didn't have to kill you too.
That friend of yours, Tommy Egan,<eos> I want to meet him.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Not gonna happen.<eos> Not gonna be paying you any more money, either.<eos> Are you forgettin' I know who you are?<eos> I know you know who I am.<eos> It's just that I now know who you are too.<eos> And I know that you and your boy on the outside killed Roberto Solletti.<eos> So if you rat me out as Ghost, then I'll spill what I know about you.
- Yeah.<eos> - You're drunk, go home.<eos> Scumbag Mak's gonna file a charge with the New York State Bar.<eos> I'm gonna get suspended or disbarred.<eos> Everything that is happening to you is happening to you because your client murdered Greg Knox.<eos> If you can't understand that...<eos> But he's innocent.<eos> He's innocent.<eos> And you wanna know what the worst part about it is?<eos> Everything he's done, he did for you.

Previously on Power...<eos> DOJ approved the death penalty.<eos> Yeah, cameras don't work, son.<eos> You know, we lost an inmate last year just like this.<eos> So if you rat me out as Ghost, then I'll spill what I know about you.
You can't shut me down.<eos> Yo, Julio, hit me back.<eos> Truth got shut down, man.<eos> - Trust me.<eos> - Trust you?<eos> You're Ghost's lawyer.<eos> Yeah, I'm yours too.<eos> Your duties of loyalty and confidentiality to both of your clients are clearly compromised.<eos> I'm not your attorney anymore.<eos> Everything he's done, he did for you.
James, I get that you're scared.<eos> I'm not scared.<eos> I'm fucking angry.<eos> I'm angry that the lawyer I trusted just got disqualified.<eos> I'm angry that I'm standing here with you wondering if you ready for this shit.<eos> You didn't pick me, I get it, but you need to get over that shit.<eos> And you need to do it pretty goddamn quickly, because if we can't trust each other,<eos> I am no good to you and I'm the nigga standing between you and a needle.<eos> Now, tomorrow is your asset forfeiture hearing.<eos> In front of the judge, the prosecution is going to present whatever it is they found in your financials that they believe links you to this crime.
Are you enjoying your lunch?<eos> It's fine.<eos> But I'm surprised you're free this afternoon.<eos> You never have time to eat with me, 'cause you're always rushing out to work.<eos> Well, there's something I need to tell you.<eos> They said I messed up a few things at work. And because of it,<eos> I'm not gonna be working that big case anymore.<eos> But it means we'll have a lot more time to hang out and stuff.<eos> That's good, right?<eos> Were you messing up because I'm staying with you now?
Only white boy I know like that is Tommy.<eos> And he only dates redheads.<eos> Which one of these black dresses you gonna wear?<eos> The honest truth, Jamie.<eos> No more bullshit.<eos> The fingerprints left on Greg's window, did you leave them there or were they planted too?<eos> I was there.<eos> Damn it, Jamie.<eos> When Greg pulled me over, he told me he had evidence pointing to you as the mole.<eos> I went to his apartment to look for it, to protect you.
- In the meantime,<eos> Mr. St. Patrick will be returned to the MCC.<eos> Where were you in there?<eos> Isn't it your fucking job to make sure that that doesn't happen?<eos> You let him call me a fucking murderer in front of my family?<eos> We knew this was a possibility with you on the stand.<eos> We took a swing and we missed.<eos> All we can do now is prepare for the realities of trial.<eos> I'll be bringing on some more associates from my firm to help assist with the case.<eos> Yeah, well, let's hope they're better than you.
Tell me the truth, Tommy.<eos> She said I was hitting it right?<eos> When that Milan shit popped off.<eos> He saw LaKeisha as a problem and solving it meant one thing. So instead,<eos> I stashed her away.<eos> I didn't plan on hitting it, it just... happened.<eos> A bunch of times.<eos> I guess I should thank you for saving my girl's life behind my back.<eos> But God damn, not for breaking her off.<eos> Now she's all into you.
In court yesterday, what were you gonna tell me before your husband took the stand?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Good night, Terry.<eos> Good night, Tasha.<eos> Yes. I'd like to speak to Simon Stern, please.<eos> Yo, Slim, you here yet?<eos> Oh, what's up?<eos> What you doing here?<eos> Clean enough?<eos> This ride should get you to Chicago.
You could have one of the uniformed guys do it.<eos> I hated the detectives who did that when I was in uniform.<eos> You're a good man, clive babineaux.<eos> - That better be tartar sauce. - Ew.<eos> What is it?<eos> Bloody shoes.<eos> The sole matches the pattern from the crime scene.<eos> Let's get you a barrel of wet wipes, and then we can go find our cinderella.<eos> Now, how about I go shower, and you have a little lunch?<eos> Almond milk chai latte for you, and the strong stuff for me.
And there's this.<eos> The malt liquor bottle you were chugging when we first met.<eos> It was still in the trash where I put it, and guess whose DNA is all over it?<eos> You're in a lot of trouble here, Mitch.<eos> I'm waiting for my lawyer to get here.<eos> Did you know they log your mail in prison?<eos> That's how we know that two years ago, you received a letter from Topher.<eos> We found the original on Topher's laptop.<eos> "Mitch. I'm writing to apologize."<eos> "You deserve to know that I'm the one who turned you in to the DEA."
- It probably won't.<eos> But it could?<eos> I'm sorry, gang, but I've got to pass.<eos> Fear of death is the lock of humanity's prison.<eos> I'm not afraid of dying, Liv.<eos> I'm afraid of remembering.<eos> Find a Guinea pig who wants to remember his old life?<eos> It's a chance to atone.<eos> "Atone"?<eos> If you won't take the serum, the first person to take that risk will be major, who, let's be honest, is only a zombie because of you.
A fundamentally decent person would realize you owe him.<eos> - Ravi!<eos> - Let's take a breath.<eos> Try to visualize ourselves in one another's shoes.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll try that.<eos> I'm Blaine.<eos> I killed people for money.<eos> - That's not what I...<eos> - I tortured you.
- Ravi!<eos> - Let's take a breath.<eos> Try to visualize ourselves in one another's shoes.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll try that.<eos> I'm Blaine.<eos> I killed people for money.<eos> - That's not what I...<eos> - I tortured you.<eos> - I literally killed you.
Yeah, we'll definitely talk tonight.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Quick comment?<eos> Quick comment about your situation, Mr. St. Patrick?<eos> A quick comment? Please, sir!<eos> How does it feel to be a free man, Mr. St. Patrick?<eos> Sir, a quick comment?<eos> Mr. St. Patrick?<eos> James, it's so good to see you back in a suit.
Why are you so suspicious of me, when all I want is the best for you, for everyone, really?<eos> It's obvious you're not here to throw me a welcome home party, Simon, so, let's cut to the chase.<eos> What a way to talk to a creditor.<eos> You owe me a substantial amount of money.<eos> I'm here to collect.<eos> Oh, I see you haven't spoken to your wife, Tasha, about the little deal we made while you were away?<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> Then I'll inform you.<eos> I gave Tasha an awful lot of money for something in return.<eos> Tasha took money from you? Mm-hmm.
Just tell him we've been selling drugs in the club.<eos> He'll understand that he doesn't have an option but to go along.<eos> You're not going back into the club.<eos> You're not going back to work with Ghost.<eos> I need him off the table entirely.<eos> Jason, um, all respect, all right, but, I've been down this road before.<eos> I'm not gonna kill Ghost.<eos> All right?<eos> Bodies are bad for business.<eos> If Ghost goes now, they'll be looking at you.
Can you sound as good as my mom?<eos> Your moms couldn't touch me.<eos> On her best day.<eos> You ever hear of Ma-hah-lia Jackson?<eos> Ma-hay-lia.<eos> And yeah.<eos> Lights out, little nigga.<eos> Ghost.<eos> We need to talk about Tariq.<eos> No, I think we need to talk about you first.
I handled it.<eos> Besides, Stern agreed that we could pay him back over time.<eos> Stern lied.<eos> He don't want money.<eos> He wants me.<eos> To work with him.<eos> No shit.<eos> I knew he was lying.<eos> But you're smarter than him.<eos> I know you're not gonna let him beat you.
Let's go!<eos> Come on!<eos> Ah!<eos> Come on!<eos> Fuck yeah!<eos> You want a piece of this?<eos> You want a fucking piece of me, bitches?<eos> Fuck!<eos> You disresected me for the last time.<eos> What you deserve is that Dre kills you, motherfucker!
W-what kind of question is that?<eos> Maybe you should leave.<eos> Nah. I ain't going nowhere.<eos> I'm calling the police.<eos> I told Holly she should call the police on you.<eos> But she never did.<eos> You know Holly?<eos> Holly Weaver, my niece?<eos> I know Holly, yeah.<eos> And I know what you did to her. Every night when she lived with you when she was a kid.
What is it?<eos> Tommy's stash house...<eos> This is where we gonna grab the money.<eos> You gonna rob your own friend?<eos> Why that don't surprise me?<eos> All right, so K, I'ma just hold tight right here while they unload.<eos> There'll be one on the outside, three on the inside.<eos> I'll go around the backdoor.<eos> Come in through the side, catch 'em by surprise.<eos> I taught you well.
Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> K, you know it ain't got to go down like this, man.<eos> Tell me you ain't feel that shit tonight. Crazy, right?<eos> How close we once were?<eos> Yeah, and then you used everything I taught you against me.<eos> You know, all this bad shit happened because you set me up.<eos> K, I had a plan, man.<eos> You ain't want to follow the plan.<eos> So I was either gonna kill you, or put you on the inside.
Jukebox.<eos> Pull over right here.<eos> Kanan, why don't you let my son walk away, man? He ain't like us.<eos> He don't belong in that bullshit, man.<eos> Talk to Jukebox, tell her she can have whatever the fuck she want with me.<eos> Just let my son go.<eos> Take it.<eos> I knew you was gonna do that.<eos> So why you give it to me?<eos> 'Cause I ain't gonna forgive you, and I ain't gonna let you go.
I ain't never been good.<eos> I wasn't raised that way.<eos> You told me Kanan was dead.<eos> I did.<eos> Tell him why you been hanging out with him.<eos> Why you taught him about that life.<eos> I was running game on you.<eos> I wanted to get the money.<eos> And get back at Ghost.<eos> I wanted to hurt him, so I used you.
Previously on Power...<eos> I'll deliver Julio to you, and you take him out.<eos> Blood in, blood out.<eos> All of the members of this prosecution will be suspended pending an investigation.<eos> I gave Tasha an awful lot of money.<eos> Tasha took money from you?
So Kanan fuckin' shoots her to save Tariq's life.<eos> Ghost, this story is so fuckin' weird.<eos> If you were anybody the fuck else, for any other fuckin' reason, you'd be dead right now.<eos> I know.<eos> Come on, I guess you guys need a ride.<eos> Yo, 'Riq.<eos> Tariq, let me ask you something.<eos> Did Dre know that Kanan was alive?<eos> Did Dre see you and Kanan together?<eos> Or was he telling the truth, that he picked you up on some corner the night your dad was arrested?
But please remind me again why you got arrested.<eos> - For protecting Tommy. - Wrong!<eos> You got arrested because you dipped your dick in that Fed bitch.<eos> Give me a break.<eos> This ain't got shit to do with Angela.<eos> Oh, it doesn't?<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> Tariq used to be a good kid, Ghost.<eos> Then he started talking back, stealing guns, and lying when you decided to leave this family for her.<eos> I didn't leave our family. I left you.
All right, so do you want to take an ad out on Craigslist or... promote me?<eos> I wanna meet with Uriel.<eos> Set it up.<eos> Put Julio somewhere nice.<eos> You got the job, kid.<eos> I win, motherfucker.<eos> He is such an asshole.<eos> Such a fucking asshole.<eos> Look, I don't know what you said, but this shit isn't very funny to me.<eos> I worked hard to get here, and I'm not gonna lose my job because of you, Angela.
Sit down.<eos> Tariq fell in with a bad crowd, okay?<eos> And he got in over his head.<eos> Was Kanan part of that crowd?<eos> Yes, he was.<eos> Now, Tariq is gonna be fine, but he's gonna need all of us to watch out for him.<eos> So the next time he decides to sneak out, I need you to tell me, all right?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - All right.<eos> Listen, it feels good to know I can depend on you.
What if Greg's murderer has been sitting right beside us this whole time?<eos> Proctor got in your head, huh, Mike?<eos> Proctor may be corrupt, but he wasn't wrong.<eos> Donovan found Greg's body.<eos> He signed the arrest warrant for St. Patrick.<eos> And he found the murder weapon at Truth.<eos> All of which is his job.<eos> We're cut off from department resources.<eos> You're not.<eos> All we're asking you is to check it out.
If they do re-indict, the jury pool, the public, it's all still relevant.<eos> If he is going to do the interview, it has to be letter perfect.<eos> You're a part of the image. Part of the redemption story.<eos> - You'll be there to course-correct, if he says something wrong.<eos> Well, you'll have his back if it comes to that.<eos> I don't want to represent your husband anymore, Tasha.<eos> But we need you.<eos> I need you.<eos> Then I will be there.<eos> But not for him. For you.
So our guy in narcotics tells us they got a call from a potential informant.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That can't be.<eos> And there it is.<eos> That's your rat.<eos> A good manager gives her employees exactly what they've earned, and since you've been more concerned about snorting than helping us sell it...<eos> Snort it.<eos> Or we'll kill your wife and child.<eos> We don't blame her. We blame you.
Markham's been missing for a week.<eos> Strange coincidences, aren't they?<eos> Saxe is many things, but he's not a killer.<eos> I mean, he might jerk off over a dead body, but actually pull a trigger?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yeah, it's not for sure.<eos> That's why I brought these files, like you asked.<eos> Great, thank you.<eos> Let's start diggin'.<eos> So yo, so tell me this, why did you cover for me with Tommy and your dad, when I'm the one that introduced you to Kanan?
Saxe is many things, but he's not a killer.<eos> I mean, he might jerk off over a dead body, but actually pull a trigger?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yeah, it's not for sure.<eos> That's why I brought these files, like you asked.<eos> Great, thank you.<eos> Let's start diggin'.<eos> So yo, so tell me this, why did you cover for me with Tommy and your dad, when I'm the one that introduced you to Kanan?<eos> I just wanted to know why you did that.<eos> I covered for you, so now you give me the truth.
I made us some dinner.<eos> Where's Mom?<eos> She with your Aunt LaKeisha.<eos> That don't bother you, after seeing what happened to Jukebox?<eos> It's not real.<eos> What is real is the fact that you been hanging out with Kanan.<eos> I need to know how you met him.<eos> I was on the street.<eos> And he told me he was a friend of Shawn's.<eos> And he told me he knew you from back in the day.

And he told me he knew you from back in the day.<eos> But he didn't tell me why he was mad at you.<eos> What'd you do?<eos> Nothing to deserve him hurting you.<eos> He didn't hurt me, though. He saved my life.<eos> And he must have had his own reasons for doing that, son, but look, no matter how nice he was to you, you heard what he said,<eos> Kanan's a bad man, done some bad things.<eos> I mean, he murdered his own son.<eos> Shawn said he was in jail for a long time.<eos> Is that why he was mad at you?
Why don't you go ahead and give me a call? I'll do that.<eos> Always keep the faith, brother.<eos> - You do the same.<eos> - Councilman, look at you.<eos> Ah, and your beautiful wife. Hi.<eos> - Good to see you.<eos> What are you hiding?<eos> None of your business.<eos> Get out of my room.<eos> I'm worried about you, 'Riq.
Tasha, what are you doing here?<eos> Look, Terry, this ring... It's just part of the costume.<eos> I mean, you were the one that told me that I needed to stand by James so he doesn't end up in jail.<eos> I did say that and I wasn't being fair, okay?<eos> Look, I don't have the right to ask anything of you.<eos> You should go.<eos> I should.<eos> But you know what, I...<eos> I just keep thinking, what if I had never met James?<eos> What if I had met you first?
The one that took out Soletti?<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause that old gangster witnessed me kill a marshal in prison.<eos> Well, that wasn't very smart.<eos> Yeah, as not smart as you killing a Homeland Security Agent?<eos> - Proctor told you?<eos> - Yeah, he told me.<eos> Oh, well, go on. I gotta hear the rest of this<eos> "I killed a marshal" story.<eos> So Teresi helped me cover the shit up in exchange for a call from you.
You can think whatever you want.<eos> I'm gonna go inside now.<eos> Your number was one of the last that Markham called.<eos> The last cell phone tower that his phone pinged off of, they are right here.<eos> Right above your place.<eos> What happened to him, Joe? Hmm?<eos> Come on, tell me now and save yourself.<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Well, you know something.<eos> Yeah, you're gonna talk to me, or they're gonna kill you.
Hey, young lady, good morning.<eos> Always good to be back in the neighborhood.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> - We ready to start?<eos> - Almost.<eos> Just waiting on one more party.<eos> Oh, I thought it was just you and I.<eos> Wanted to maximize the optics.<eos> What better way than introducing you and one of the young kids you helped save from the neighborhood?
- Let's go.<eos> So Mike came to your house last night? Yes.<eos> He talked to my daughter.<eos> Told her not to tell me that he came by.<eos> He didn't realize that I had custody of them over the weekend.<eos> He thought I'd be home alone.<eos> Maybe he just wanted to talk about the case.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> He told Mak that Donovan was the mole, right?<eos> I think he went over there to kill you because dead men can't exonerate themselves.
Um... okay.<eos> Um, same as I've always told you. He left when you were too young to remember, and... he died a short time after.<eos> Where did you meet him?<eos> Atlantic City.<eos> I was dancing at the Tropicana.<eos> I told you this already.<eos> Why do you want to know about your father all of a sudden?<eos> Because I spoke to some guy named Tony Teresi last night.<eos> Motherfucker said he was my dad.<eos> He said he met you in A.C. and that he likes redheads.
Is there any way that this guy is telling the truth?<eos> You both got blue eyes.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Could be. But, listen, about the Jimenez...<eos> What you want me to do?<eos> Sit around and wait for the Jimenez to take their sweet fucking time and finally decide to either agree to my terms, which they should have done in the room, strategize how to wipe us off the fuckin' map?<eos> And you sure your people got your back?<eos> You telling me they gonna go to the mattresses for Julio?<eos> What about Chicago?<eos> They gonna back you up if shit goes south?
So if my father is dead, who the fuck is Tony Teresi?<eos> And why the fuck is he holding me outside our house?<eos> If you lie to me one more fuckin' time, Ma!<eos> Okay, fine. - Fine, Teresi is your father. - Oh, my God.<eos> Is that what you wanted to hear?<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - I wanted to explain...<eos> Get the fuck away from me!<eos> He came to the house.<eos> He held you for a minute.
Is that what you wanted to hear?<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - I wanted to explain...<eos> Get the fuck away from me!<eos> He came to the house.<eos> He held you for a minute.<eos> I took the picture.<eos> Then he... he left.<eos> He said he'd be back in a half an hour. He never came back!<eos> Tommy, don't you get it? He left you!
That was real information, Angela.<eos> Later that day, he called you.<eos> I think you went over to his place, and when you were there, the Federales called him back.<eos> He must have realized you were the mole, and you shot him to protect your secret.<eos> Angela, this is bullshit.<eos> I know you want an answer for Greg's death, we all do...<eos> When we were prosecuting St. Patrick, you handled Greg's phone records.<eos> But you never mentioned the calls to and from the Federales, Mike.<eos> You redacted them from the records.<eos> There would be no reason to do that unless they implicated you.

My friend.<eos> I'm not waiting.<eos> - Damn it. - Not this time.<eos> I'm going in, Saxe.<eos> You wait here and listen.<eos> You still have time to make this right.<eos> We can go to Mak together...<eos> I can't let you take me down, Angela.<eos> I didn't have a choice, but you did.<eos> I will go to Mak myself and tell him everything I have on you.
Is that true?<eos> Where he goes we will follow.<eos> Uriel?<eos> He has the support of the Toros Locos.<eos> You're here taking a position against your connect.<eos> Why should we trust you?<eos> Because I want to be the biggest goddamn drug dealer in New York City.<eos> And I can't do that working for Tommy.<eos> That's great, but we have plenty of primeras, plenty of territory.<eos> Why should we take additional risks when we don't have to, when we can easily murder you right here and your friends by sunrise?
They have over 20 hotels and nightclubs all across the world.<eos> I can arrange that your drugs be sold in each one of those hotels and nightclubs.<eos> A whole new revenue stream.<eos> If you can do that... we'd be very much interested.<eos> Thought you would.<eos> I just need some time.<eos> We will give Tommy what he wants to buy you some time.<eos> But you don't have forever.<eos> We can make a lot of money.<eos> If you fuck this up... I'll kill you myself.
Well, that does not seem very PC.<eos> Or is it allowed if you're darker than a Band-Aid?<eos> I'm not ready to be around people yet.<eos> And maybe that includes you.<eos> You should go.<eos> I'm not in uniform.<eos> And you're nice and anonymous.<eos> Anonymous?<eos> There are, like, four Asian girls in this prison and my girlfriend just died.<eos> Oh, so let them comfort you, then.
Sometimes it's best to just use whatever's available on hand.<eos> Come on!<eos> Open the door, Flores.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I prefer not.<eos> How'd you like ten more years in prison?<eos> I don't mind it so much now that we running the place.<eos> Go to the chapel.<eos> Tell Maria the Jolly Gay Giant is back.<eos> When I get in there, I'm going to personally take you apart, Piscatella style.

Nothing.<eos> It's a tough fucking crowd.<eos> Got any family out there?<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> So... it took me one whole minute to look this cute.<eos> It only took me 30 seconds to get so pretty for you.<eos> Rude.<eos> What?<eos> I'm two years younger than you.
Hey, guys.<eos> So... it took me one whole minute to look this cute.<eos> It only took me 30 seconds to get so pretty for you.<eos> Rude.<eos> What?<eos> I'm two years younger than you.<eos> My mom always said shit starts to fall at, like, 29.<eos> How come no one ever told me this before?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe they were protecting you.
You a hero, man.<eos> Girl, that's a mistake.<eos> Don't you know you always got to pay for the flipper?<eos> You really think... Kandy with a "K" is gonna win Ultimate Grand Supreme with her own God-given teeth?<eos> Hell, no!<eos> - Can we watch 106 Park now?<eos> - Sure can.<eos> You didn't ask for permission.<eos> I ain't be needing your permission or nobody.<eos> Well, Ms. Tendler says otherwise, 'fore she knock the black off of you.
Well, Ms. Tendler says otherwise, 'fore she knock the black off of you.<eos> You sound like a old lady.<eos> Man, I am a old lady, as of today.<eos> And it's my TV time. I asked. So...<eos> Nobody else likes the shit you watch. It ain't fair.<eos> What the hell are y'all doing?<eos> Dante, no TV for the next week.<eos> Fucking bullshit!<eos> I hate it here.<eos> Don't like you much neither.
- You're out of here.<eos> - No. No, no, no, no. That's a mistake.<eos> You can't let me go.<eos> I'm a danger to society, sir.<eos> Be that as it may, we can't keep you.<eos> No charges have been filed.<eos> Let...<eos> let's go.<eos> Frank, Janie called.<eos> She'll be over to get you after she drops the kids at soccer.
Uh, you made a vow, you need to commit to Vinnie, something like that?<eos> Right?<eos> I mean, I get it.<eos> I memorized it.<eos> You can save it.<eos> No.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> That is a twist I was not expecting.<eos> I realized when... when we was...<eos> I was looking down at you, and then I saw,
No, no, no.<eos> I'm... I'm...<eos> This is not funny.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> I know you're serious.<eos> I know, baby.<eos> And that is the problem.<eos> Because you are also bat-shit crazy.<eos> I didn't mean to lead you on, honey.
This is not funny.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> I know you're serious.<eos> I know, baby.<eos> And that is the problem.<eos> Because you are also bat-shit crazy.<eos> I didn't mean to lead you on, honey.<eos> It's the hormones.<eos> The hormones, they made me do it with you.
What am I gonna do when I have a snack attack or my period?<eos> I can respect the moral code, but being that blindly committed... that's when shit gets dangerous.<eos> Okay, 10 minutes.<eos> India was my favorite section because it kind of reminded me of being in here, you know, being forced to deprive yourself and stuff.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, it was like Weight Watchers, but with, like, more cows and less point counting.<eos> Prison's like free Weight Watchers.<eos> I've lost, like, at least five pounds.<eos> Like I haven't noticed.<eos> Those khakis are falling off of you.
"Peach, lavender, rose petal.<eos> Yes, please!"<eos> 'Sup, Amanda?<eos> Mackenzie.<eos> - When'd you get in?<eos> - Yesterday.<eos> Well, you've got good taste in books, so you're all right with me.<eos> - Taystee.<eos> - Poussey.<eos> Your mama did not name you Pussy.
I did have a snake once.<eos> A Burmese python named Krueger.<eos> Technically, it was Cal's, but Krueger liked me best.<eos> - Did you ever talk to it? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> When I was feeding him.<eos> Epic conversations.<eos> Mostly about the merits of frozen versus fresh mice and why Mike Powell never loved me back.<eos> You cold-blooded for sure.<eos> Nobody asked you, Hufflepuff.<eos> White girl hitting you with some mad expelliarmus!
What she needs is her old routine back.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well... - we ain't in Kansas no more. - Mmm.<eos> I got an idea.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Yeah, all right.<eos> But if she start yelling "cunt," I'm callin' me a Catholic.<eos> - So you're looking for painters?<eos> - Not exclusively.<eos> It's really whatever inspires you. Anything.
- No, seriously.<eos> We got to make this place nice and fix it up.<eos> Like you said, it's depressing.<eos> So come on.<eos> Get your crayons.<eos> I've always been more of a girth gal, myself.<eos> Don't like them long jobbies that poke your cervix.<eos> Amen to that.<eos> Ain't nothin' like a Fat Albert.<eos> Those fatties stretch you out.
No.<eos> Foot jobs.<eos> Like hand jobs, but with your feet.<eos> Whoa.<eos> How does that even work?<eos> Imagine picking up a hot dog... - Whoa. - ... with your toes, and then massaging it with your arches.<eos> It gave me calves like a speed skater.<eos> Mmm!<eos> Lorna?<eos> I can't believe I'm lookin' at you.
Listen, I told your blonde friend that Joe and I are over.<eos> Wait.<eos> You don't think they're really doing sodomy, do you?<eos> What do you care?<eos> You've got your new crush to worry about.<eos> Listen, I'm just trying to keep my head above water, okay?<eos> When's this all gonna be over, anyway?<eos> Once she realizes you're not gonna put out.<eos> ...aromatherapy, and Shih Tzu.<eos> Is this one bothering' you?
What about "tits" spelled with numbers?<eos> That, too.<eos> - Oh!<eos> Jeffrey Dahmer's birthday.<eos> - I've tried everything!<eos> It's useless!<eos> All that hard work was for nichevo!<eos> I'm a failure!<eos> I failed my girls!<eos> I failed you!
Oh, my God.<eos> The answer was right under our noses.<eos> So to speak.<eos> Come.<eos> I know what we must do.<eos> You look radiant, by the way.<eos> Where you think you're going?<eos> Outside.<eos> My husband is coming for me.<eos> You go out there, the pigs are gonna throw you in Max faster than you can say,
Holy ravioli.<eos> My husband put his mozzarella all over my baked ziti, and he told me that he loved me.<eos> Isn't that romantic?<eos> Lorna la Loca!<eos> Hey, blondie. Does the, uh, carpet match the drapes?<eos> Hey, uh, let me test the echo in your love cave.<eos> I promise, you'll only like it a lot.<eos> Nichols!<eos> Oh, what's the matter?<eos> I'm not white enough for you?
Shit will make your eyes pop.<eos> Whoa, now back the fuck off.<eos> Come on.<eos> Oh, look like butchy want to play.<eos> Ooh.<eos> Anybody ever tell you size matters?<eos> Motherfucker.<eos> Yeah, fuck off.<eos> That's right.<eos> And it's Mr. Butch to you!
It's our hilarious joke!<eos> I don't think he can hear you.<eos> That woman looks mentally ill.<eos> - Jesus fucking Christ.<eos> - Your wife, I take it?<eos> No.<eos> Wrong prison.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - I love you!
Nice.<eos> - Wow.<eos> So simple.<eos> Maybe I should learn how to read.<eos> You brought her favorite.<eos> Listen, I'm sorry about last night.<eos> I was drunk and insensitive and rude, and you did not deserve that.<eos> It's okay.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I know how much she meant to you.
Nah, I shaved this morning.<eos> This just my afternoon shadow.<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> I think it's a really bad idea.<eos> I meant the hair.<eos> Oh, Bill, come on, don't be such a wet rag.<eos> Can't we just enjoy the fact that I'm back?<eos> I missed you.<eos> Come here.<eos> You know how pissed the cops are gonna be when they see you on television before you've given them a statement?
Come here.<eos> You know how pissed the cops are gonna be when they see you on television before you've given them a statement?<eos> Honey, the only point of giving an exclusive is so you can tell your story to a worldwide audience before you tell it to anybody else.<eos> Don't think that's how the law works.<eos> - We're ready for you, Ms. King.<eos> - Ah! Finally!<eos> All right, time to bathe in a little limelight.<eos> Wash off the stink of that terrible place.<eos> Meredith... darling!<eos> Judy, it is so good to see you.
Those women?<eos> Look.<eos> It's the princess of prison.<eos> Yo! This little mic thing is diggin' into my tit.<eos> I'm moving it.<eos> Can you still hear me okay?<eos> 'Cause I got lots to say.<eos> I...<eos> I didn't realize that there was gonna be another guest.<eos> - Didn't my assistant fill you in? - Mmm-mmm.
Pronation is when you're really positive about the country, or, like, when your feet go out.<eos> Yeah, well, nothing would have went out.<eos> People would have been perfectly happy with their desirable beverages if two shitbags I know didn't piss in my yellow drink.<eos> Ow! My finger.<eos> - What'd you do?<eos> - I didn't fucking touch her.<eos> My shot-off finger started to hurt the second she got close to it.<eos> Oh, like ghost pains?<eos> Tell her to stay away from me.<eos> I'm gonna have to ask you to leave while Leanne uses the shower.
Movement?<eos> It's a damn riot.<eos> Well, Meredith, I think this is all happening on the heels of losing one of our young inmates,<eos> Ms. Poussey Washington.<eos> Such an enormous loss.<eos> She was my mentee, you know.<eos> I...<eos> Well, more than that, she was my friend.<eos> Judy, I'm sorry.<eos> - That must be devastating for you...
You did that!<eos> Look...<eos> And I know that sometimes our only choices are between shitty and shittier, but whatever we end up doing, we gotta own it.<eos> Somehow find grace in it.<eos> Come on.<eos> The bodega was out of the wing ones, so I got you the extra-long.<eos> Thanks.<eos> That guy that works there, what's his name?<eos> - Paolo?<eos> - He asked about you.
The bodega was out of the wing ones, so I got you the extra-long.<eos> Thanks.<eos> That guy that works there, what's his name?<eos> - Paolo?<eos> - He asked about you.<eos> That's not embarrassing at all.<eos> - Why?<eos> You like him or something?<eos> - No.<eos> 'Cause I think he got a little crush on you.
The point is, he's dead in the head and can't defend himself.<eos> But you still can.<eos> Just please, stop already.<eos> You got to stop being a manatee, Daya.<eos> Just floating around, watching the world go by you with your big eyes, waiting for the boat to ram its propeller into your head!<eos> You got to be the shark.<eos> No, you're the shark, Ma.<eos> But that don't mean I'm the fucking manatee.<eos> What up?<eos> Knew you had that boricua in you somewhere.

Or prop his dick up with some popsicle sticks and duct tape.<eos> Okay, um... so according to my Italian, they're either going to ride my horse or eat ice cream on me.<eos> I'm wagering that you're the ice cream in this scenario.<eos> What if we put something up his ass?<eos> You know if you tickle his prostate right, you get a rise out of him.<eos> - Mmm. - Or we make him watch porn.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What kind of porn you like?<eos> What?<eos> Doesn't look good for you, man.
There isn't a single thing you don't ruin, is there?<eos> It ain't about the fish.<eos> What is it?<eos> You can tell me.<eos> Claire won't talk to me.<eos> Paolo's too embarrassed to even look at me.<eos> And I had to pretend I got detention during lunch 'cause I didn't have no one to sit with.<eos> That's it?<eos> Shit.<eos> I thought that pervert PE teacher with the glasses touched you again.
Here, have a little drink.<eos> Now, you should probably expect some, uh, primo headaches, a little bit of short-term memory loss, even a soupçon of hellish hallucinations.<eos> Let's try and sleep through some of that?<eos> Oh, I feel like my hot flashes are having hot flashes.<eos> That, too.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm gonna make you a cold compress, because I am all in on this whole role-reversal thing we got going here, okay?<eos> Every parent becomes the child sooner or later.<eos> But I didn't think it would happen so soon.<eos> It was for you, Nicky, and for my girls.
That Dayanara saved us.<eos> That's funny.<eos> I don't feel saved.<eos> - Well, we're still negotiating.<eos> - So the end justified the means.<eos> Look, I know how I am with a cause.<eos> I know that I'm like a dog with a bone.<eos> Or an angry dragon on its lonely mountain of gold.<eos> That, too.<eos> I know she freaks you out...
Spooky children.<eos> "Spooky children," bitch?<eos> That don't even sit right with me.<eos> Look, instead of me checkin' the children, how about you check your damn self?<eos> - Um...<eos> No! - Angie, you suck at this!<eos> - No, I wasn't done!<eos> - Give it to me!<eos> Peace out.<eos> I see you!
You did what you had to do.<eos> I know Daya got herself in some bad shit.<eos> Just tell me she's okay.<eos> Yeah, yeah, she's okay.<eos> - You lying bitch!<eos> - What?<eos> Yo, this bitch lied to me twice!<eos> Aleida, calm down.<eos> I'm staring at my daughter in handcuffs right now!<eos> I ask you to look out for her and the next thing I know she's shooting somebody and confesses?
- Oh, boy.<eos> - Frieda, missing.<eos> Gina, missing.<eos> Yoga, and now Blanca and Nicky...<eos> - Let me guess...<eos> - Missing.<eos> I didn't know that Piscatella paid such close attention to your social circles.<eos> This is serious, damn it!<eos> Red, I wanna believe you, but you're making it impossible.<eos> Did you ever think that maybe your prison pals are avoiding you because you're being, like, an aggro psychopants?
Like, shocker.<eos> She's probably with that new girl.<eos> Somehow she found a sexy loner we've never seen in prison before to hook up with.<eos> We've all been there.<eos> Red, what's the, uh...<eos> What's the frying pan for?<eos> For hitting him with.<eos> Okay.<eos> You need to get some rest, okay?<eos> And when we see Nicky, we're going to have her kick that girl out of bed and come find you.
No.<eos> What we have to do is destroy the jeans, then lay low.<eos> Keep our heads down.<eos> What happened to changing the world?<eos> It's gotten too dangerous.<eos> I thought you were brave.<eos> But you don't want anything to change.<eos> You're the rebel that they can tolerate.<eos> You get to sit here and play your music and feel like a punk, but if you're threatened, you step right in line, don't you?<eos> That's why they leave you alone.
You have to go further.<eos> Where?<eos> Vladivostok?<eos> Too many fish.<eos> We can't talk here.<eos> There's still five minutes before the morning whistle.<eos> Hurry up, Miss!<eos> Screw off.<eos> I'm talking to my sick mother!<eos> You always said I never took you anywhere.
You're not Jewish.<eos> You pay them... to find your Jewish relatives.<eos> - And how does that help me?<eos> - If we were married...<eos> So that's your plan.<eos> Listen.<eos> We don't have to be together in that way.<eos> It can all be for show.<eos> I know you think...<eos> I'm not man enough for you.
Let's just say it's a good thing I do yoga.<eos> Wait, I never do that shit.<eos> - Yoga.<eos> Where is she?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - And Gina and Norma?<eos> Shit!<eos> - I don't know!<eos> Oh, what?<eos> I mean, this isn't enough, uh, distressed damsels for you?
Watch closely, Nichols, 'cause you're gonna be contestant number two.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> I genuinely would love to understand how it is that a man gets to be this fucked up!<eos> Come on!<eos> What's the original narcissistic wound?<eos> Nicky, stop.<eos> He doesn't speak human.<eos> Now that is right, Stalina.<eos> Because I discovered a long time ago that actions speak a whole lot louder than words.<eos> Inmates will always try to cheat, manipulate or deceive you.
What are you doing?<eos> I'm showing your family who you really are.<eos> Fucking...<eos> You're a vain... weak... pathetic... frail old jailbird.<eos> You can dye your hair, paint your face... but it doesn't change the truth underneath.<eos> Here's your fearless leader, inmates.<eos> Look!<eos> Ow!<eos> Look long and hard at what prison does to a person!<eos> I swear, I'll kill you!
I got "blank, blank, N, T, blank."<eos> I got "S, A, blank..."<eos> Santa!<eos> - "Dancer," like the reindeer!<eos> - Nice.<eos> Nice.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> You seem down.<eos> It's stupid.<eos> Nothing that matters to you is stupid.
You seem down.<eos> It's stupid.<eos> Nothing that matters to you is stupid.<eos> All right, it's not a big deal.<eos> Rosado and his merry band of bitches swiped my radio yesterday.<eos> I'll kill them.<eos> No, seriously, should I kill them?<eos> - No. Come on.<eos> - I'll kill them.<eos> I will kill them for you.
- Too brown.<eos> But a man's finger could be nice.<eos> I got an idea.<eos> Come on.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> You're comin' with us.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Um...<eos> I don't know you, but whatever's going on over there, it sounds rough, and, um... I hope you're okay.
Well, of course, it was a suicide mission.<eos> All of the inmates ended up dead, either by killing themselves, in the ensuing gunfire, or later, through the death penalty.<eos> I suppose that's the big takeaway from this, that the inmates guarding the hostages almost never survive.<eos> Tough stuff.<eos> Up next, is that a poochie in your Gucci?<eos> What did you think would happen, Red?<eos> You'd get out of here someday?<eos> Pick up where you left off with your little mafia friends?<eos> Be honest.<eos> Is there anything even out there for you?
Help! Help!<eos> Help!<eos> I can't think.<eos> - Help!<eos> - You shut... shut your mouth.<eos> High-pitched sound.<eos> Fucking irritating.<eos> Help!<eos> - Those stairs are a doozy.<eos> - I will teach you.
Good or bad white girls in the yard.<eos> There's a dead or dying guard.<eos> - Wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> - Good night.<eos> Dead guard?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Over in the next bed.<eos> I have excellent peripheral vision.<eos> Like, I'm looking at you right now, but out of the corner of my eye, I can see him being very not alive.
"Hot Cheetos.<eos> Beyoncé.<eos> Yearly gyno visits."<eos> That's one advanced kid.<eos> Turn it over.<eos> "Don't try anything, or we all die."<eos> Let's fuckin' get her.<eos> Make it count this time.<eos> I swear to God, if one more of these bitches tries to fuck me, I'm...<eos> - Nobody wants to fuck you, asshole.
They needed a piss break.<eos> And I couldn't say no.<eos> One of them already peed on themself.<eos> Fuck no!<eos> Back in the bubble, bitches.<eos> - I gotta pee.<eos> I gotta pee.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> You too lax, Mama.<eos> Your kids must run all over you.
No!<eos> No!<eos> I think that's probably enough.<eos> Come on, Desi.<eos> We take 'em out when they start screaming.<eos> I don't hear anything, do you?<eos> He saw me.<eos> I know you're down here, inmate.<eos> Oh, please, make this hard for me.<eos> It'll give me the pleasure of wrecking you later.
We take 'em out when they start screaming.<eos> I don't hear anything, do you?<eos> He saw me.<eos> I know you're down here, inmate.<eos> Oh, please, make this hard for me.<eos> It'll give me the pleasure of wrecking you later.<eos> Oh, you're gonna have to do better than a pushpin.<eos> Teamwork!<eos> Ah, how do you like that, Fruit Brute?<eos> I will skin you alive.
- So can I have an Advil or something?<eos> - Well, I can't see why not.<eos> As long as it doesn't affect your self-esteem.<eos> You know, I gotta say, you seem real nice.<eos> Aw, well, thank you.<eos> - Now, what is your name?<eos> - Kasey.<eos> Well, Kasey, it is very, very nice to meet you.<eos> Likewise.<eos> It's cool when people surprise you, you know?
- Pardon?<eos> - You didn't do nothing, all right?<eos> I got a plan.<eos> Just... Fuck.<eos> Just... just...<eos> Just trust me.<eos> Oh, yeah, I have literally zero idea why I would do that, seeing as how you just locked me in a shithole for no reason!<eos> Listen.<eos> You gotta be patient and wait.<eos> I'm gonna get you out of here soon.
You think I got time to handle more bullshit?<eos> I'm in there busting my ass, trying to make shit better for all of us by myself, and you bringing me some nonsense?<eos> That Suzanne is freaking out?<eos> Well, spoiler alert.<eos> That's what the fuck she does.<eos> She freaks out!<eos> Look, I ain't got no magic Suzanne wand.<eos> Whoa, whoa, maybe you missed the part... about the dead guard?<eos> Look, but...<eos> Oh, you mean the part where you thought it would be a good idea to run up in here and tell me some shit that can make this whole thing fall apart if somebody heard you?
I'm getting somewhere.<eos> So you tell me what's more important... one girl who can't handle not getting her breakfast on time or the rest of us who is in here tryin' to survive every day?<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> Live on the scene here at Litchfield Prison.<eos> No new activity in the last few hours.<eos> We are still awaiting any...<eos> - Hey, I was watching that!<eos> - And I was turning it off.<eos> You better get your booty to the bus stop.<eos> If the bus leaves without you, you got a long walk.
Cindy.<eos> My sister?<eos> Your daughter.<eos> She's in that jail that's going off, and you're pretending she don't even exist.<eos> I care about her very much.<eos> - You're not worried?<eos> - Honey...<eos> I didn't tell you before because I didn't want you worrying, but Cindy's not in that place.<eos> She was transferred to another facility a couple of months back.<eos> And I'm sorry for keeping it from you.
Impressive.<eos> Girl scout?<eos> All right, uh, give me a hand over here, right?<eos> I wish that we could go back to the us from two days ago and let them know that this is where we were gonna be.<eos> - Blanca, you'll carry the torch, yes?<eos> - Actually, Red, I'm pretty tired.<eos> All right, let's pretend we're at a Jewish wedding, right?<eos> One, two, three!<eos> I hate all of you.<eos> Aw, we hate you back, Red, but with love!
- Hey!<eos> - You came back!<eos> Oh!<eos> I should get kidnapped and held hostage by a psychopath more often.<eos> I've had a lot of guys make a lot of excuses for disappearing on me, but that by far is the most ridiculous one I've ever heard.<eos> Okay. I'll work on it.<eos> Hey, girl, what happened to your face?<eos> - Your friend, the feral one? - Ah.<eos> She's mad at me.<eos> She thinks I stole you or something.
I'mma be there when you wake up.<eos> I got a plan... and I'mma be right next to you before you know it.<eos> Mama's coming for you.<eos> Until I get there, I need you to...<eos> I need you to fight.<eos> You put up those fists and you fight.<eos> I ain't never gonna tell you that again after this, but today... today...<eos> Today, you fight.<eos> You fight like hell!<eos> I love you.

I ain't never gonna tell you that again after this, but today... today...<eos> Today, you fight.<eos> You fight like hell!<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, Benjamin Mendoza.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> I love you more than my life.<eos> I would trade places with you.<eos> I would trade places with you if I could.<eos> I love you.
Uh...<eos> Please get down.<eos> Just stop it.<eos> That's... that's... that's not how it works!<eos> I think we gotta be firmer with her.<eos> Yo!<eos> Stop!<eos> Yo!<eos> Yo!<eos> You better get your ass down here before the rest of these bitches throw it down for you!
This whole thing started because of Poussey!<eos> She the reason we doing this!<eos> And this place will never be what it was because of what you did for her.<eos> In her name!<eos> If you say no to this now, it will all be for nothing.<eos> Not to mention, you are gonna piss off a lot of people.<eos> The women in here...<eos> and the guys out here.<eos> And their weaponry is a hell of a lot more punishing than anything a CO wears on his belt.<eos> What you see out there... is a shit ton of people who are also angry at you.
And I am gonna scrounge together the finest cocktail that Litchfield has to offer.<eos> I already got some Tylenol from Arsenic and Old Lace over there.<eos> It probably expired in '98.<eos> Expiration dates are a marketing scheme.<eos> Totally bogus.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm gonna go to the pharmacy.<eos> I'll see if I can get you something harder.<eos> Wait, you're actually considering going back out there?<eos> - For you.
Which is why I think it's very important for me to go find out...<eos> - You know what?<eos> Go. Just go.<eos> - No.<eos> - If you want me to stay, I'll stay.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - I'm serious... - I'm...<eos> Go.<eos> I actually...<eos> I actually don't even want to look at you right now.
I think I need to make a pit stop first.<eos> Starting to think maybe we shouldn't have snorted all that coffee.<eos> Coffee has been proven to give you the shits.<eos> Something about bowel spasms.<eos> Bet you feel better after you push some brown out.<eos> Jeez!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Wrong end!<eos> Come on...<eos> let's get you to a bathroom, mama.
I mean, you're also crazy, but, uh, unless you put these in someone else's piss...<eos> - No, I did not.<eos> - Well... okay, you're with child here.<eos> No.<eos> No, that's not... that's not... possible, because you said...<eos> I didn't believe you.<eos> All right, maybe I was scared, you know, imagining a hairy little bambino popping out of your vajayjay.<eos> It's not exactly the stuff of masturbatory fantasies.<eos> But, uh...<eos> Hey, I'm happy for you.
What the hell are you doing here?<eos> - Sir, I'm...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I... - Get away from me!<eos> Get away from my house.<eos> You got about two seconds to get off my property.<eos> Wait, I wanted to tell you that... that I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What am I gonna do with that?<eos> You want me to say I forgive you?
Get away from my house.<eos> You got about two seconds to get off my property.<eos> Wait, I wanted to tell you that... that I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What am I gonna do with that?<eos> You want me to say I forgive you?<eos> I just wanted to tell you that I... I'm responsible.<eos> It was my fault... and I wanted to tell you that in person because I know you're angry, and you should be...<eos> - so I'm here to...<eos> - You want me to punish you.

Yeah, a hero with a practical ability.<eos> - Breaking through a wall?<eos> - No.<eos> He satisfies your thirst on demand.<eos> That's a hero in my book.<eos> That's a cocktail waitress.<eos> I'm still holding out for the ability to fly.<eos> All done.<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> Your mother's gonna kill you.
He's not exactly normal, but...<eos> Not normal?<eos> High survival rates.<eos> That's the message here.<eos> Yeah, hello?<eos> Vincent, hi.<eos> Uh... you don't know me.<eos> - But I am Lorna's friend.<eos> - What?<eos> She put you up to this?
She's got, like, four kids.<eos> And no tits.<eos> I mean, I keep telling Lorna this. She don't listen to me.<eos> Just keep telling her until she does.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You know... all her life, all she has ever wanted is for somebody to reassure her that she is worthy of love.<eos> So if you do that, then, um... you know, she will be good to you, she will take care of you.<eos> She will even overlook all those things that are so deeply fucked-up in you.<eos> Uh, and yeah, when she gets out of here, she will, uh... uh, probably hack your phone or maybe, uh, key some female coworker's car.<eos> But, yeah, she's gonna do it 'cause she loves you.
You pervert our faith.<eos> Heda would be ashamed.<eos> I'm doing what's best for Trikru.<eos> You would understand that if you had stayed and done your duty.<eos> I was called.<eos> My daughter was not meant to wander the earth looking for nightbloods.<eos> My daughter was meant to lead armies.<eos> My daughter was meant to lead our people.<eos> Looks like you found that daughter now.<eos> Roan sent me here to kill you.
My daughter was meant to lead our people.<eos> Looks like you found that daughter now.<eos> Roan sent me here to kill you.<eos> If I don't come back with the flame, he will send others.<eos> If the spirit of the commanders deems it my time, then so be it.<eos> Indra, tell me what you want me to do here.<eos> Without the flame, the king is vulnerable.<eos> We will need to fight to keep him on the throne.<eos> If that's what you want me to do,<eos> I'll do it for you.

The radiation would have killed them in days.<eos> This won't save anyone.<eos> Leave us.<eos> He was one of the looters.<eos> You were wrong about the flamekeeper.<eos> And the flame?<eos> Destroyed before I could kill him.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It'll be more dangerous now.<eos> More people will have to die to keep me in power, not that that bothers you,
I've had to move into some hovel on the edge of the village.<eos> It just isn't me, darling.<eos> My finances are tied up in this place.<eos> Then sell it!<eos> This is not just my home.<eos> It's a place where ex-offenders can live and start again.<eos> How very selfless.<eos> My aim is to open up the entire house so that others can stay.<eos> Oh, you're really starting to bore me now, darling.<eos> You either sell this place and give me half the profits or I'll reveal to the press that my fictional lover was based on you.
What?<eos> - I wanna be that person.<eos> - What person?<eos> The person that does this for, like, an hour and then leaves.<eos> That's not what this...<eos> Doug, I've been having sex for as long as you have.<eos> And when you called me, that's what it sounded like.<eos> And I thought, "Great." But I'm here now.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I should take you home.

But I'm here now.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I should take you home.<eos> No.<eos> - You don't have to.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - I'll take a cab.<eos> - I'm taking you home.
- Basil Hayden?<eos> You're killing me, buddy.<eos> - What do you got?<eos> - Bulleit's as good as it gets in here.<eos> I'll have that.<eos> - Woman?<eos> - Work.<eos> Yeah, well, nothing's forever, man.<eos> Those two down there, and anyone else who comes in here until that's gone.<eos> That's for you.
- And what are you saying?<eos> - Nothing. It was on my way home.<eos> No, it wasn't just on your way home.<eos> We tried to go to the Museum of Fine Arts.<eos> It was closed.<eos> It was freezing that day.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And this was on in your room.<eos> - It was.<eos> - And I asked you to kiss me.

Previously on Genius...<eos> As long as you are married, we can not be together.<eos> I have to think about daughters.<eos> I brought a family to Berlin for you. "You came for the Academy."
I can not do this.<eos> I admire Lenard, the master of experimental physics, But so far he has done nothing but theories.<eos> Did he write that?<eos> On the first page of the fucking newspaper!<eos> The Jews, of course, published.<eos> Lenard objects to the theory of general relativity With such condescension that until this moment I did not consider it necessary to answer him.<eos> I intend to improve myself.<eos> These are my beliefs!<eos> And I will defend them!<eos> Why does he blame you?
Excuse me, Mrs. Einstein.<eos> The question was for your husband.<eos> How did you come to know Chaim Weizmann?<eos> It's all right, Chaim, you can admit you don't understand.<eos> Albert, you have been explaining general relativity for more than three hours, and I am fully convinced that you understand it.<eos> I anticipated that many would struggle to comprehend my theory, but I must admit, I've been a little taken aback by the jeers and the snubs, particularly from the Nobel committee.<eos> There will always be resistance to revolutionary ideas.<eos> But we've proved it with mathematics, with astronomy.<eos> Some people see a beautiful proof, others a damning repudiation.<eos> That's why certain scientists loathe you, while the rest of the world has fallen hopelessly in love.
There are dozens of nations hospitable to Arabs.<eos> But our tribesmen?<eos> They have nowhere to go.<eos> I sail for the United States next week to raise money for a Hebrew university in Palestine.<eos> Come with me.<eos> I should never have let you go to dinner with Chaim.<eos> I knew this would happen.<eos> You are providing ammunition to those fools who believe that Jews cannot be good Germans.<eos> I've never aspired to be a good German.<eos> Well, this does not concern only you.
And what about Brussels, the Solvay Conference?<eos> You're the only German scientist invited,<eos> - and you're simply going to cancel?<eos> - Four years of carnage. Now I should be the one who is supposed to heal all the wounds of the war?<eos> And Eduard, you're going to miss his piano recital.<eos> I'll take him sailing this summer.<eos> He'll understand.<eos> To you, this is a chance to do good.<eos> To the rest of the world, it is... it's a famous man putting his race above his country.<eos> And your enemies will use it against you.

That is foolish thinking.<eos> Well, then what do you say to those who believe Jews should assimilate into American society?<eos> I say it is a Jewish weakness, trying always to keep the gentiles in good humor.<eos> Dr. Einstein is here to raise funds for a university.<eos> Education is a boon to all.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> I don't appreciate anyone doing my talking for me!<eos> Tell her, Chaim.<eos> You brought me here to speak out, not to trot in front of the press like some circus animal.<eos> Chaim brought you here to advance the cause.
Or asked Betty to do so.<eos> Maybe she was otherwise engaged.<eos> Between your thighs perhaps?<eos> This is nothing, with Betty.<eos> Some pleasure to numb the world's constant pull upon me.<eos> It has nothing to do with our life.<eos> You are a selfish man.<eos> You have convinced yourself that your contributions to the world absolve you from the responsibility you bear to those you claim to love.<eos> They do not. I've never said that.<eos> Your actions speak for you.
Well...<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> Obviously you shouldn't do porn.<eos> Unless it's, like, porn Shakespeare.<eos> Since you're such a nerd, you'd probably enjoy that.<eos> You know, I miss you making fun of me.<eos> Why don't you come visit me in Pasadena, then?<eos> - Ugh. It's so far away.<eos> - Come on.<eos> I've called you like a million times to hang out.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!<eos> - Witness is playing at the Dome.<eos> - I can't leave my mom with Randy all day.<eos> She'll feed him Funyuns and Fresca and government conspiracies.<eos> Go.<eos> Go, I get it.<eos> Um...<eos> I, um...<eos> I miss you, too.<eos> Randy only loves you 'cause your boobs are full of food.
- I'm exhausted.<eos> How old are you?<eos> Nineteen.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay. We'll see.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> Ruth Wilder.<eos> Looks like you.
- Well, I don't really know wrestling.<eos> You don't think wrestling is acting?<eos> It's not, is it?<eos> It's...<eos> It's more like a sport with costumes?<eos> Or...<eos> Are you hiring actors to play wrestlers, or are we the wrestlers? Yes.<eos> Which one?<eos> Do people think you're pretty?<eos> Because, like, I'm looking at you... One second, I think, "Fuck, yeah, she's hot,"
Oh, Christ.<eos> This throw is called the hair mare.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Your turn, ladies.<eos> So, what's our backstory?<eos> Our what?<eos> What's motivating this?<eos> Why are we fighting?<eos> What's... What's driving you to come after me and grab me by the hair and throw me to the ground?
I'll do the rest.<eos> Nice.<eos> Good job, Cherry.<eos> Cute outfit, Pippi Longstockings.<eos> Next!<eos> Get off of me!<eos> Creepy, but I like it.<eos> Next!<eos> Please!<eos> I beg you!
I gave you basic direction.<eos> You didn't follow it.<eos> You're both out.<eos> There are no scenes to read, no character work, so, yes, we improvised.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Fucking actresses.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm feeling generous.<eos> Sophie's Choice.<eos> Why should I pick you and not her?
Fucking actresses.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm feeling generous.<eos> Sophie's Choice.<eos> Why should I pick you and not her?<eos> Go. Girl fight.<eos> I'm a real actress.<eos> I will work my ass off, and I will make you believe me when I do stuff, even if it's just hair pulling.<eos> Well, that was a very nice pitch. Very earnest.<eos> What about you?
You're wrong about me.<eos> Yeah, I doubt it.<eos> Damn, girl.<eos> How long must this... go on?<eos> This punishment?<eos> Haven't I served my term?<eos> Can't I apply... for a pardon?<eos> You know what I feel like?<eos> I feel... all the time... like a cat... On a hot tin roof.<eos> Who has come here... to save... you... and you... and you... from evil.
It just happened.<eos> Haven't you learned anything from that sad fucking scene study class?<eos> Things don't just happen.<eos> People make choices.<eos> They want things, and then they go for them.<eos> Can we go somewhere and talk about this?<eos> - I don't wanna fucking talk to you.<eos> - I wanna...<eos> I wanna kick your ass.<eos> And then I never want to see you again.
He could obliterate London, Moscow.<eos> Many years ago, Fritz Haber tried to convince me his poison gas would end the war more quickly.<eos> It only made it more horrific.<eos> Science must never be used for violence.<eos> Do you think Adolph Hitler shares your moral reservations?<eos> You must contact Roosevelt. He will listen to you.<eos> That's the trouble, Leo.<eos> What if he does?<eos> Achieving an atomic chain reaction will be the greatest feat in the history of German science.<eos> And to think, the Fuhrer has put you in charge of all of it.
The Germans do not have a bomb.<eos> I'm told the intelligence is quite conclusive.<eos> Well, if you are right, we can all take a breath.<eos> But I'm also hearing that our American friends are very close to succeeding. Even if that is true,<eos> Hitler and his Grey geese are in retreat.<eos> The Americans will not need an atomic bomb to defeat Germany.<eos> What about Japan?<eos> They wouldn't.<eos> That's why I am here, Albert.<eos> To ask you to write another letter to Roosevelt.
- Oh, see, that sounded very paternal. - Shut up.<eos> He's this guy. He delivers pizza.<eos> - Are you coming in the limo with us?<eos> - Sam's gonna follow us there.<eos> - That's probably better. - Okay. Thanks.<eos> - Great. - Let me see. Give me this.<eos> Look. She's not gonna miss shooting the pilot.<eos> I think she's gone.<eos> I'd be gone if I were her.<eos> If she's anything like you, she's stubborn and confrontational, so, go find her.
- I'll take some coffee. - Oh.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How did you find me?<eos> I called the pizza place. I ordered a pizza.<eos> I shook down the kid who brought it, and he sang like a canary.<eos> So, you must be the famous Billy.<eos> Relax with the standing and sticking your chest out.<eos> I'm just here to talk.<eos> I don't have anything to say to you.<eos> Look, I'm sorry I tried to fuck you, okay?
Have to take a rain check on that coffee.<eos> Lovely home, though.<eos> It's very nice.<eos> That looks crazy.<eos> It's theatrical. It's a glitter unibrow.<eos> - I like it. - Yeah. I like it, too.<eos> I don't like it at all. It looks crazy.<eos> Oh, yeah. What are we gonna do?<eos> When you're done with hair and makeup, check with Jenny about costumes.<eos> - If you're waiting, stretch with Cherry. - Who put you in charge?
All right, who wants to make ten bucks? Huh?<eos> Who here likes women's wrestling?<eos> $10... all you have to do is sit.<eos> Fuck this time travel shit, okay? This movie's sold out till midnight.<eos> What are you?<eos> We're the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling.<eos> If you wanna see more, you're gonna have to take this money and meet me across the street at the Hayworth.<eos> American-made piece of shit!<eos> Whoa. Save it for the ring, all right?<eos> Hey, Glen! See you out there.
And it looks like evil's winning today.<eos> Go back to the Middle East, dune coon.<eos> Oh!<eos> We've got a beer drinker here tonight, folks.<eos> - Fuck you! - That's okay.<eos> We're having a good time.<eos> What the fuck is your problem, man?<eos> Y'all got to go.<eos> - Screw you. - You don't want me to come out.<eos> I will fuck you up, baldy. And you, Gregg Allman.
Then I focus all my attention on it, like a laser beam.<eos> It helps.<eos> Or I could take one of Bash's Quaaludes.<eos> He offered.<eos> Our third match tonight is a doozy.<eos> Beauty versus the Beast.<eos> From the neon streets of Hollywood, weighing in at 103 pounds...<eos> - I love my fans. - Say hello to Melrose!<eos> Don't fucking drop me.<eos> I think I love you!
Oh, joke's on you. I got implants.<eos> Hey, shut up. You weak, geriatrical-type person.<eos> And so far it's just insults.<eos> Let's see if this cold war will start heating up soon.<eos> - I don't feel like wrestling. - I wrestled last time.<eos> Looks like the Biddies are deciding who will fight first. Oh!<eos> Zoya the Destroya and Fortune Cookie have pounced on their opponents.<eos> The rules have gone completely out the window.<eos> Wow, these girls are really disrespecting the elderly.<eos> - I love you, but not that much. - This is dumb!
Yeah.<eos> I am a proud American mother.<eos> - Oh, no way. She was faking. - Did you know?<eos> No. Of course not. I would've told you.<eos> - That's right. - Freedom!<eos> And I'm ready to kick your Soviet ass all the way back to Siberia.<eos> Please.<eos> Look at this brave American.<eos> Honey, will you just hold this?<eos> If this is too silly for you, you can leave.
You cannot go back.<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> What we all do.<eos> Decide.<eos> _<eos> - Hey, where's Kady?<eos> - Who gives a shit?<eos> I don't think Penny even cares that she's gone.<eos> Believe me, he does.<eos> We're gonna make another you.
- Mm-hmm. Yes, you did.<eos> - You fucked with our castle.<eos> - Amen, sister.<eos> And now the High King and I hereby declare war on the kingdom of Loria.<eos> Yes!<eos> Wait, really?<eos> I cast the niffin summoning, and you didn't come.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> I was right there.<eos> I killed you.
You have got to stop.<eos> Fine.<eos> Let me out of this trap, and I'm gone.<eos> Okay, look, Alice...<eos> Evil Thing Inside of Me That Used to Be Alice...<eos> I have to say the words to open the trap.<eos> Of my own volition.<eos> Out loud.<eos> And I'm not going to do that because there is one policy for you out here, and it is to box you up for eternity.<eos> I'm kind of boxed up right now, in you.
- No problem.<eos> We're just discussing how to handle your situation.<eos> That's okay.<eos> My way is best way.<eos> But you can abort it, right?<eos> This is exorcism.<eos> That thing is not human.<eos> The longer it's inside you, the more tangled it gets with your essence and the harder it is for me to help you, you understand?<eos> Okay.<eos> Then I exorcise the trickster for you.
Must've been a serial killer in a past life.<eos> Yeah, raise your hand if she's the reason that you fucking exploded in this life.<eos> I'm sorry for everything that's happened.<eos> Yeah, speak for yourself.<eos> For everything that you're going through.<eos> Mm, now you're just lying to her, Q.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm just having a hard time.<eos> - Yeah, because you blame her.<eos> - I'm not blaming you for Alice.
Look, I got to do this, okay?<eos> I owe her.<eos> So?<eos> You gonna ask the traveler you just fucked the shit out of to help?<eos> I mean, no, I didn't really feel like I had the right.<eos> That's noble.<eos> But ask.<eos> Not gonna lie, I always wanted to rob a bank.<eos> To our little thievery corporation.<eos> PS, we still hate you.
♪ Beat, bam ratatata tatatatata ♪<eos> Whipped that up trying to get anybody to dance at our cottage soirees, but it came on a bit strong.<eos> Shit.<eos> There's no way we can pick this lock.<eos> Maybe we can brute-force it.<eos> Hold on.<eos> I think this door is too thick, even for you.<eos> Okay, just so we're all on the same page, we've got less than four minutes.<eos> Penny!<eos> We're getting you out!
- It's gonna be okay.<eos> - Julia.<eos> - Julia.<eos> - Come on. Hey.<eos> - Julia.<eos> - Jules, stay with us. Come on.<eos> Julia?<eos> Hey.<eos> No, don't move around too much.<eos> Sun patched you up, but it's gonna take a while.
If my legacy is to be tied to the atomic bomb, it will be for preventing its use.<eos> I need you to join me.<eos> I'm running the Institute now.<eos> I can't get involved in politics.<eos> What are you so worried about, the wrath of university administrators?<eos> I'm worried about Hoover.<eos> He probably knows what color socks I'm wearing right now. It's not safe for me.<eos> You?<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> It's not safe for you either, Albert.
Hans, trust me.<eos> This is beneath you.<eos> You've always excelled in science.<eos> Target your ambitions, and then aim higher.<eos> Engineering is my ambition.<eos> It isn't science, Hans.<eos> I don't want you to give up on science like your mother did.<eos> Give up?<eos> She sacrificed herself for all of us.<eos> For you, most of all.
I was at the office.<eos> No, I called the office.<eos> There was no answer.<eos> There are moments when I get absorbed in what I'm doing, Hans.<eos> You know that.<eos> Yes, I certainly do.<eos> But I have always hoped that once...<eos> Just once in my life...<eos> You'd be absorbed with your family instead of your work.<eos> But we're just a burden to you.
I only realized at the end of his life that he wasn't being cruel.<eos> He was terrified for me.<eos> And I forgave him for it... only too late.<eos> I'm proud of you, Hans.<eos> I hope you know that.<eos> You're a brilliant engineer.<eos> Bernard, it's your turn, go.<eos> And a far better father than I ever was.<eos> What about Eduard?<eos> I love Eduard as I love you.
_<eos> I'm getting married.<eos> To me?<eos> Do you want to get married?<eos> - To you? - Mm-hm.
Yeah, I'm trying to be personal.<eos> Oh, yeah. Thatta girl.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Look, if this blows up...<eos> - Yeah, I know. You'll take it back.<eos> - There you go, sweetheart.<eos> - Thanks, girlfriend. See, that's how easy it is.<eos> Be in touch.<eos> "Now, what are you doing back here?"<eos> I thought we'd got rid of you. When was it?
- OK.<eos> Um...<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - I'll stay because it's wasteful, and...<eos> - Take it with you.<eos> I know why you didn't contact me.<eos> Do you?<eos> You know I do.<eos> It's OK.<eos> I mean, it's not OK for you, but it is OK for me.
In the meantime, the best thing you can do is find the people who did this.<eos> Hey, Dr. Bell.<eos> Look at this.<eos> If I could see 100 more animals change like this, I'd be a happy man.<eos> Seeing me every day doesn't make you happy?<eos> It does ease the pain of being stuck in here, yeah.<eos> Good morning, Elias.<eos> How's my favorite cousin?<eos> - Hey, Gus. - [chuckles]<eos> I am so glad I caught you.
even before the inheritance.<eos> Get out.<eos> Out.<eos> [scoffs] Are you going to let her do this to me?<eos> I need my rest, Gus.<eos> I-I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> Oh. - Get him out of here, please.<eos> - But...<eos> You are far too nice to these people.<eos> You know when they say that the stress will kill you?
Well, I had a situation recently with a violent patient, and I'm still feeling a bit shaken.<eos> Well, I'll be in there with you.<eos> He's no problem.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I still think I'll just observe from here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I did a psych rotation in residency.<eos> I can... Yeah if you don't mind, just basic questions.<eos> Sure.<eos> Yeah. Thank you.<eos> So Hunter, what, uh, what brought you in here today?
Now, can you give me the multiples of seven in order?<eos> 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35.<eos> You started with zero. Everyone always forgets to start with zero.<eos> That's good.<eos> And you're passing with flying colors.<eos> Just a couple more questions, man.<eos> Do you remember how you got here?<eos> I was at a party...<eos> What about the fight? Do you remember being in a fight?<eos> What about the cop that drove you here?
That's good.<eos> And you're passing with flying colors.<eos> Just a couple more questions, man.<eos> Do you remember how you got here?<eos> I was at a party...<eos> What about the fight? Do you remember being in a fight?<eos> What about the cop that drove you here?<eos> Officer Bauer? Hold up, hold up.<eos> What? The police, they said you were in a gang fight.<eos> An officer drove you here.
Clarke's deciding who's worth saving.<eos> That... that is just great.<eos> Guess what, Monty. You're not.<eos> What?<eos> See for yourself.<eos> Clarke thinks your expendable.<eos> Clarke, wait.<eos> Really?<eos> I found your list.<eos> I guess we know who really matters to you. J...
Don't fight it.<eos> Roan wants you alive. Come quietly.<eos> That'll happen.<eos> One in the leg.<eos> Doesn't have to be this way.<eos> It does. You made sure of that.<eos> I said, I wanted you alive.<eos> Your fight is over...<eos> Octavia of the Sky People.<eos> I shouldn't have locked you up.
Who the hell is Anna?<eos> Okay everyone, gather around.<eos> Here's what we know.<eos> Three people are dead, at least.<eos> Something is clearly very, very wrong and we need to let the authorities know that we are here and alive.<eos> Now since it doesn't seem to be dangerous in itself, and since whatever it is is no longer in the hallway. I suggest we send someone to the radio to call for help.<eos> I'm not going in there.<eos> Me neither.<eos> Well someone has to.<eos> What about you?
Chief Heisel.<eos> Connor.<eos> - Come on. - Hey, Connor!<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Hey, take it easy.<eos> Connor.<eos> Try it again.<eos> I dare you.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You think that's gonna make me stop calling you a pussy? !
To never forget his warmth, his kindness... and his love of cheap wine.<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> No underage drinking.<eos> Come on.<eos> You of all people should know what it can lead to.<eos> We should get some sleep.<eos> Good night.<eos> "Baby doll."<eos> What?<eos> The old lady outside... she called you her baby doll.
Pulling that trigger won't end anything.<eos> Kane and Monty will be executed, and our side will open fire.<eos> It'll be a bloodbath.<eos> You're a prisoner.<eos> You're just saying what they want you to say.<eos> I know all about that.<eos> I'm done with this.<eos> Move, or I'll kill you, too.<eos> Riley, stand down, ok?<eos> I am begging you.
Freddie!<eos> I don't know. Where is he?<eos> I have to find my sister.<eos> She was in medbay.<eos> How did this happen?<eos> - There.<eos> There.<eos> O. O!<eos> Come on. Let's go. Go.<eos> I got you. I got you.
Previously on "The Magicians"...<eos> The High King and I hereby declare war on the Kingdom of Loria.<eos> One cannot simply take back a declaration of war.<eos> My hands can't cast spells anymore.<eos> Help me, I do what I can.<eos> I'm a member of the Order, the keepers of The Libraries of the Neitherlands, the greatest repository of knowledge.<eos> You're a niffin.<eos> Q, I'm not blood-thirsty, I just want to be free.<eos> Penny!<eos> We're getting you out!

The pain will burn you till there's nothing.
What do you mean, lost her Shade?<eos> When the Mudang cut the demigod's soul out, they--they nicked hers by accident.<eos> Her Shade, it's gone.<eos> Is she gonna be, like...<eos> Honestly, I-- I don't know.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Hey, Jesus, what day is it?<eos> It's Friday.<eos> Are you...<eos> Listen, I just want to thank you for everything you did to help me.
I checked your work, it's fine.<eos> Nothing can break a Word As Bond.<eos> I must've overlooked something.<eos> No hurting anyone.<eos> No casting magic.<eos> No sex.<eos> Trust me, you locked down any possible fun.<eos> I held up my end of the deal, Q.<eos> Now it's your turn.<eos> Or box me now 'cause I'll drive you insane.
No offense, Q,<eos> I didn't actually ask your opinion.<eos> Thanks, though.<eos> Julia, wait.<eos> Hi, Julia.<eos> You thought I'd forgotten about you?<eos> You seem like the type to move on quick when you're finished with a girl.<eos> Eh, generally.<eos> Unless they're carrying my child.<eos> I was protecting you.
Phosphoromancy.<eos> My discipline, idiot.<eos> McKellan's got a scope that can bend light into the past.<eos> Phosphoromancy.<eos> Ugh. I'm an idiot.<eos> Correct.<eos> Shut up, I--remembered.<eos> Uh, okay, so the viewing device, it's in Professor McKellan's office.<eos> Ooh, Penny.<eos> See, even he can't wait to get away from you.
I'd sooner be skinned.<eos> All right, boys, let him go.<eos> Give us some air, but stay close-ish.<eos> Hate Fillory all you want.<eos> I'm here for one thing, and then I'm off this planet.<eos> An invisibility spell strong enough to hide from a god.<eos> And why should I give it to you?<eos> Because I may not give a shit about Fillory.<eos> But I do, as its Royal Ambassador, have access to its guards and its dungeons.<eos> And I'll use A to throw you in B, but help me, and I'll let you go free.
With me.<eos> My loyalty will always lie with me.<eos> Drill a hole in it.<eos> Wear it.<eos> No god can sense you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> Hey, dryad boy!<eos> Come on out.<eos> I saw you in there, sweetheart.
You can't break it.<eos> Why don't you do something useful and catch up on all the classes you missed in Fillory?<eos> This isn't working.<eos> Yeah, tell me about it.<eos> Keeping you a secret and trying to help you while you do God knows what.<eos> I have to ask for help.<eos> I need to tell someone.<eos> Great idea.<eos> You think you know locked up for crazy?<eos> They'll put you someplace you can't even imagine.

Can we go back there now?<eos> Right.<eos> Wait, Quentin, no.<eos> I'm serious, don't.<eos> Q, stop.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Q, please, wait.<eos> Please, Quentin, don't.<eos> You...<eos> Tricked you with reverse psychology?
Maybe it was you.<eos> You can see me.<eos> Of course I can.<eos> What on earth are you doing inside this boy?<eos> Friar Joseph, I-- I've been searching for you.<eos> I need your help.<eos> With him.<eos> This crushable little field mouse?<eos> Seni baglamak.<eos> I bind you.

Well, not just, but-- yeah.<eos> You know, yeah, I did.<eos> Were you not listening to a word I said?<eos> Yeah, I was listening.<eos> But guess what, it's not up to you to decide if you're worth my time.<eos> I get to do whatever the fuck I want with it, even if it is spend it on a girl that threatens to bail all the goddamn time.<eos> 'Cause guess what, Kady?<eos> I didn't think I was ever gonna fucking see you again.<eos> And that puts shit into perspective.<eos> I love you.
I imagine you are highly motivated.<eos> It's healing well.<eos> Sabine will be pleased.<eos> I could protect marigold better if I knew what it was,<eos> Obergruppenfuhrer.<eos> I have the rsd for protection.<eos> The fuhrer's guard doesn't normally take assignments.<eos> Outside of his protection.<eos> They do for an operation.<eos> This important. All I need from you is to find out. What the allies know about marigold,
Yes.<eos> The germans found out there were two allied spies.<eos> Faber had to show due diligence and I had to protect.<eos> Aurora's team.<eos> You sent them to die.<eos> Faber and I had to sacrifice.<eos> Two discard agents... "discard"?<eos> ! They were people, sir!<eos> Do you think. That I don't know that?<eos> I thought. That if I didn't send you into the field, You wouldn't die.

I need to find her before things go south for me.<eos> - How long do I have?<eos> - Weeks. I've developed a serum that could potentially undo the memory loss that accompanies the second zombie cure.<eos> The way we left things, I didn't think you...<eos> Don't!<eos> So, Doc. How's my ticker?<eos> Deafening.<eos> Well, you don't appear poised to shuffle off this mortal coil.<eos> That makes one of us.<eos> The bad news is, all the memories you lost when you took the cure that turned you from a zombie back to human?
- Got it.<eos> Loud and clear.<eos> Now he's got it.<eos> You look awfully pleased for a man who just got kicked in the kidneys.<eos> What on Earth were you...<eos> Oh, God.<eos> The tracking device.<eos> - I slipped it in his pocket.<eos> - Are you mental?<eos> - He just threatened to kill you!
These guys are zombies.<eos> They know how to eliminate zombies.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'll stay away.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Victim's spleen appears abnormally enlarged.<eos> You know what else appears abnormal?<eos> The way Peyton and Blaine were acting last night.<eos> Very chummy as they watched The Usual Suspects, and that is the last thing that I will say about that.<eos> The loveliest trick of the devil is to persuade you he doesn't exist.
Um... They say a lot of killers do that when they're kids.<eos> I'm sure you didn't.<eos> What if my memory comes back, and I just see stuff that I'm unequipped to deal with?<eos> That's not the Blaine I know.<eos> You can't just assume the worst.<eos> Yeah, well, the Blaine you knew killed people.<eos> Okay, and behavior like that just doesn't come out of the blue.<eos> A few of those people probably begged for their lives.<eos> Maybe you'll find some good memories in there.<eos> People you loved who loved you back.
Just wait till I tell Felicia in HR.<eos> Excuse me, sir?<eos> Sir!<eos> Sir!<eos> Sir!<eos> Oh, my God, Major.<eos> Sir, can you come with me?<eos> Why did you come here?<eos> Sir, I'm gonna have to call security.<eos> To save you?
Oh, my God, Major.<eos> Sir, can you come with me?<eos> Why did you come here?<eos> Sir, I'm gonna have to call security.<eos> To save you?<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> We need to get you outta here before your benefactor's muscle shows up.<eos> And where do you propose I go?<eos> Okay, I know a place.<eos> It's an organized group of zombies. They can protect you from Oates and provide you brains.

They can protect you from Oates and provide you brains.<eos> You don't get it, Major.<eos> Seattle doesn't work.<eos> This man, he will hunt me down.<eos> So, unless your group of zombies has offices in Sri Lanka or the Amalfi Coast, I can't go.<eos> - I can't walk away and leave you here.
This man, he will hunt me down.<eos> So, unless your group of zombies has offices in Sri Lanka or the Amalfi Coast, I can't go.<eos> - I can't walk away and leave you here.<eos> - I agree. You can't walk away. You need to run.<eos> You have no idea what he'll do to you if he finds you here.<eos> Oh, I have a pretty good idea.<eos> Don't worry,<eos> I'll figure a way out of this.<eos> - Some day.<eos> - I left you once.
Wait, is this really the most important thing we could be doing right now?<eos> I mean, The Beast is still out there waiting for us...<eos> The Beast can wait for five minutes.<eos> You are all Kings and Queens of Fillory.<eos> Well, almost all of you.<eos> Just revel in your majesty for one fucking second.<eos> Be regal, miscreants.<eos> Mm.<eos> You're such a stupid, stupid, man.<eos> I'm gonna kill you in your sleep.
I'm gonna kill you in your sleep.<eos> El...<eos> El... El, you okay?<eos> Totally fine, why?<eos> It's just... you went away there for a minute.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> I feel great.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> I'm kind of on a clock here, so we should talk strategy.<eos> Yeah, we already talked strategy, so we just need to catch you up.
That doesn't help us.<eos> This one seems to want to run its course until they're all dead.<eos> Shit.<eos> Dead.<eos> - I have an idea.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Do not let them kill each other, okay?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> I call on you. Our Lady Underground.<eos> As a child of the Earth... I seek you, O Mother.
Mm-hmm.<eos> I call on you. Our Lady Underground.<eos> As a child of the Earth... I seek you, O Mother.<eos> - Hey. - Mm?<eos> Do me a favor and just believe it.<eos> A benevolent Mommy who will solve my problems with her Gaia power? Yeah.<eos> Or Reynard won't show.<eos> You realize I don't even own a pair of yoga pants.<eos> So act.<eos> I seek to know you, Divine Mother.

To hear your voice. To feel the beating heart of you.<eos> I beseech you. Hear me now.<eos> What happened?<eos> Where are we?<eos> A park. Few blocks away.<eos> Is this a joke?<eos> Take us back now.<eos> Well, we can't go back.<eos> Reynard's scented you before.<eos> If he smells you again, he won't show.
If Reynard had killed Marina, don't you think there'd be lots of little Marina bits lying around?<eos> She ran.<eos> I don't think she even finished the spell.<eos> We're gonna have to start this all over again, and now we've lost Marina.<eos> I don't even know how we're supposed to do...<eos> Don't be so hasty.<eos> Are you absolutely sure it didn't work?<eos> If I were your fox god, I might just, say, follow her home rather than kill her on the spot.<eos> You knew this was going to happen.<eos> Why do you think I took you out of there?
But just get it over with and kill me...<eos> All in good time.<eos> You know, it doesn't take Freud to see that a god who likes to prey on chicks is compensating for a lack of... something.<eos> What even are you?<eos> God of Goat Herding?<eos> Grapes?<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> Is it Manure?<eos> I bet you love coming here and fucking with mortals 'cause back home in god-land, you barely rank.<eos> Watch your mouth, or I'll slice out your tongue, and I'll eat it in front of you.
Reflex.<eos> Okay. Fine. We'll go.<eos> Hey. Thought exercise. Say we kill The Beast.<eos> Quentin, I don't know.<eos> It's just... it's a distraction.<eos> Come on.<eos> Um...<eos> I would... I'd eat an ice cream sundae.<eos> With whipped cream and... those fake rainbow-colored sprinkles and... gummy bears on top.<eos> I'm probably gonna try and win you back.
You've changed. Okay.<eos> You are not the girl that I met a million years ago.<eos> You are amazing.<eos> And not that you weren't amazing before, but...<eos> Quentin, where are you going with this?<eos> You've grown.<eos> And you're still growing, and my point is that I am too.<eos> Are you saying you're "not that guy anymore"?<eos> No, I'm saying that I'm not just that guy anymore, and I think that you...<eos> I hope that you give me the opportunity to be better and actually deserve you.
Alice.<eos> We can make a deal.<eos> Think of the fun we could have together.<eos> You don't have to...<eos> But I want to.<eos> Disappointing.<eos> Your turn.<eos> Alice!<eos> You got her attention. Now what?<eos> I'm sorry for all the times I was a total dick to you.
The woman pleasuring herself?<eos> That one's lovely. Thank you.<eos> Oh, Paul, I love to draw.<eos> I can see.<eos> Yeah. Let's draw now. You and me, Paul.<eos> Let's draw Margot.<eos> Oh, no, not again, darling.<eos> Peter, bitte? Fur dich.<eos> Hold, please, thank you.<eos> I could draw you 500 times daily.
Those are your eyes.<eos> Hm.<eos> Dinner is served.<eos> Paul... are you awake?<eos> Oh, well, I... I wasn't.<eos> I just wanted to apologies for Otto's manner.<eos> He's German and an architect, and that can be an unfortunate combination.<eos> But he is a genius.<eos> I'm sorry about my drawing. It's never been my...<eos> Oh. Please. I didn't invite you here to draw, did I?
They certainly are.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Especially the way her left breast is slightly more raised than her right.<eos> I do enjoy sleeping with her.<eos> Yeah, part of me thinks I should propose to her again.<eos> Sorry?<eos> I love her body... .. as much as I love concrete.<eos> - Hello, I'm Tom.<eos> - Paul.<eos> What's brought you to this part of the world?
And don't be alarmed - - I may be dressed as an Arab.<eos> I can't face it. I don't want to talk to any of these people.<eos> I don't feel well. I'm going to bed.<eos> Darling, will you make sure everybody has a good time?<eos> And you, too, Paul.<eos> But... I'm not sure I know how your mind works, Margot.<eos> I'm sure you do.<eos> And I'm sure you know how to make a party swing delightfully.<eos> Make it a huge success.<eos> I'm counting on you.
I'm sure I can find you a job helping in that.<eos> Oh, Margot, you are wonderful.<eos> Oh, Carlo, thank you for another lovely meal.<eos> Please give my regards to the chef.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Arthur!<eos> Pottsie. It's me, Paul.<eos> Pennyfeather!<eos> Dear chap. How are you?<eos> How lovely to see you.
Oh, Carlo, thank you for another lovely meal.<eos> Please give my regards to the chef.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Arthur!<eos> Pottsie. It's me, Paul.<eos> Pennyfeather!<eos> Dear chap. How are you?<eos> How lovely to see you.<eos> This is my... friend, Margot Beste-Chetwynde.<eos> What brings you here?
Pompilia de la Conradine.<eos> Ah. Real name?<eos> Betsy Brown.<eos> Age?<eos> 22.<eos> Real age?<eos> 22.<eos> Experience?<eos> I was at Mrs Rosenbaum's in St James' for two years, ma'am.<eos> I'll see. Well, I will try and find something for you.
I have a few phone calls to make.<eos> All right, ladies, how did that go?<eos> Good?<eos> Everyone happy?<eos> Good.<eos> I'm sure you'll all be off to Rio before you can say "dengue fever".<eos> OK, come on, then. Hurry up.<eos> Grimes?<eos> Pennyfeather!<eos> My dear chap, I thought I'd encounter you again.
Landed on my feet again.<eos> - Foot!<eos> - Shush, Renee.<eos> No, I was hiding out in a pub in Soho, when I heard that this syndicate were looking for a chap to travel to Rio with a group of ladies, to run a place of entertainment there.<eos> They were hoping to have someone who could control themselves when it came to the ladies.<eos> So, I said, "Where do I sign?"<eos> So, we're both working for Mrs Beste-Chetwynde?<eos> Yes, indeed. The team reunited.<eos> Only goes to show how small the world is.<eos> Well, it's wonderful to see you back at full force.
Oh, yes.<eos> We must have a drink before you sail.<eos> We must. Now... you can reach me here.<eos> Jolly good.<eos> Chop-chop, ladies.<eos> And it's for these reasons that Rome fell to the Goths.<eos> I see.<eos> Let's pause on history for a moment and consider some maths.<eos> I need to do quadratic equations, apparently.<eos> Peter, is something bothering you?
That sounds lovely.<eos> Oh, Otto, you stupid man!<eos> What's happened?<eos> But he's been seen coming out of Pamela's house at midnight!<eos> She's married to Lord Popham.<eos> Oh, I can't be seen marrying Otto now.<eos> They'll mark me down as a cuckolded harlot. Oh!<eos> Margot, please don't marry Otto. He doesn't love you.<eos> He only loves himself.<eos> But I love you.
♪ But I, being young and foolish... ♪<eos> Lovely.<eos> ♪ With her did not agree ♪<eos> Well done!<eos> IRENE: Thank you.<eos> Thank you, ladies.<eos> I think we did very well.<eos> -You did so well.<eos> -Cheers.<eos> But your taxi's gonna be waiting for you, Mum.
I mean, he's the nicest guy in the world, but that kid's unemployable.<eos> Please. Look.<eos> I-I've gotten myself into a bit of a hole.<eos> I-I can't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You need a haircut.<eos> Vincent?<eos> Where are you?<eos> I tried Dunbar and Calloway's, and they're all a bit arch, to be frank.<eos> I have a client for you.
Oh, Vincent?<eos> How is the inquiry going?<eos> Madness.<eos> I'm calling the minister in a couple of weeks.<eos> I'll tell you, I'm gonna tear the house down.<eos> Listen.<eos> You take care.<eos> I'll talk to you later, yeah?<eos> It's fierce claustrophobic in here.<eos> I'll have it sorted out for you in a shake.
I can't make this place my office, Ray.<eos> I talked to Pete.<eos> He only uses it about an hour a month.<eos> So as long as you need it, it's yours.<eos> Look, I have to pop home.<eos> I need you to do a few things for me.<eos> .<eos> .<eos> ERIC: Right.<eos> I'll have that to you by the end of the week.
I'll see you in 10.<eos> -Ray? -RAY:<eos> In here!<eos> Wow.<eos> What is this place?<eos> It's an old metalworks factory.<eos> And now it's yours.<eos> Ray, I can't use this place as my office.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> I'm fixing it up for you.
Instead, it argues that Mr. Coughlan's public persona ought to deprive him of his privacy in this case.<eos> Mr. Coughlan deserves the full protection of this court to spare him from the irreparable harm that would necessarily be caused by the defendant's actions.<eos> I'm going to make an order restraining The World and The World Online from any further publication or dissemination of this video either online or in print.<eos> I will reserve costs of the hearing of the action.<eos> I'm sorry I was late.<eos> I was on the phone to the minister, and...<eos> Well...<eos> ERIC: Tara, I'm so sorry.<eos> I wish I could make it so that it never happened.<eos> I love you, and I need to see you.
That's the risk.<eos> I'll, um... I'll leave it with you.<eos> MEG: Why is that guy not telling us everything?<eos> Ray told me you're also a private detective.<eos> -Mm-hmm.<eos> -You free tomorrow?<eos> It's a Saturday.<eos> Please?<eos> I'll make some time.<eos> I've got a job for you.
It's all right, love.<eos> It must have been so...crushing.<eos> Yes, it was.<eos> Well, that's covered, that, then.<eos> Well, Eric was very sad and very sorry and ashamed and...<eos> Contrite.<eos> Penitent?<eos> Upbraided?<eos> Yes.<eos> He wants to win you back.
Tara's well within her rights.<eos> She didn't sign a contract with us.<eos> We never got 'round to it.<eos> Get the wedding back on.<eos> Offer her a partnership.<eos> I don't care what.<eos> But I do care about having to uninvite half of Dublin's biggest hitters and of looking as big a fool as you already do.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> I do.<eos> I will do anything to make it right to get you back.
-...of our special holiday.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You've been working on your tan.<eos> -Uh-huh.<eos> -Me, not so much.<eos> No.<eos> A bit of a farmer's tan, you have.<eos> This is so lovely.<eos> I don't want to go home.<eos> -I love you.
Yeah.<eos> You've been working on your tan.<eos> -Uh-huh.<eos> -Me, not so much.<eos> No.<eos> A bit of a farmer's tan, you have.<eos> This is so lovely.<eos> I don't want to go home.<eos> -I love you.<eos> -I love you more.
.<eos> Here's to you, big man.
-Thanks for coming.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> -Hey, Tara.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> -Hey, Ada.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Hey, look, I'm sorry to hear your wedding's on hold.<eos> I bet your mum's delighted.<eos> Irene.<eos> I saw you in the style section and said, "Airbrushed.
! Did you know about this? !<eos> ADA: Of course not!<eos> How could I have known?<eos> EVE: But I took care of him.<eos> ADA: Yeah, but he's the one who...<eos> I'm sole beneficiary.<eos> I got everything.<eos> Eve.<eos> I can't believe he did this.<eos> You'll have the firm behind you if this is challenged.
If she takes the house, we've got nothing.<eos> Sean's mentioned quite a bit in Ada's affidavit.<eos> She's just grasping at straws.<eos> Do Sean and Ada not get on?<eos> They get along fine.<eos> Eve, what you said about your dad promising you the house --<eos> Did anyone witness that?<eos> There was a nurse.<eos> I-I have her details here somewhere.<eos> Long term, I think we can make an application that your dad didn't make proper provision for you in his will.
We say we're not guilty, and we fight it.<eos> That's your job.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> MAN: Get - - Careful!<eos> Hey, Mick, come on.<eos> Do you know how much that's worth?<eos> Careful. Now -<eos> - Hey.<eos> Swear to God.<eos> Drop that and I'll drop you.
Oh, don't be fooled by the whole "namaste runs through my veins" act.<eos> She's a conniver.<eos> Have you been taking your echinacea?<eos> You look tired.<eos> You are a ridiculous person.<eos> See?<eos> This is why she wants me out in the street.<eos> If it's not some squiggle that someone is willing to pay a million euros for, it's useless.<eos> It's all money, money, money.<eos> I don't want you out on the street.
I might even allow some hair pulling.<eos> But look, it won't be on the public record.<eos> I like the sound of the hair pulling.<eos> You always did.<eos> -[ Cellphone ringing ] -Sorry.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Do you think she'll go for it?<eos> Do you think she'll give us the house?<eos> -ADA: I don't believe this.<eos> -I think your sister loves you.
So?<eos> It was meant to show vulnerability, earn your trust.<eos> I suppose grand gestures aren't my forte.<eos> I'm more of a words man.<eos> Guff.<eos> Guff is your thing.<eos> Fine.<eos> Guff.<eos> You see, there's the law, Ray.<eos> And I'm not gonna sugarcoat it for you.

No, she did, because Sean was trying to sell the fireplace.<eos> Yeah, but he didn't.<eos> And anyway, he was gonna put the money back in the house.<eos> He didn't tell me about it because he thought I had enough going on with Dad.<eos> Ada isn't lying about the structural changes either, is she?<eos> She is.<eos> We're not going to do anything with the house.<eos> Why is she trying to wreck my life?<eos> I think it's the opposite, Eve.<eos> Look, she doesn't want you and the kids out.
Whoa-ho!<eos> [ Laughs ] [ Laughs ] Yes!<eos> Yes.<eos> This guffmeister got me off with a poxy fine and some community service.<eos> It wasn't all this jammy bollocks.<eos> A large part of it was off the back of your continued employment of me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, Ray.<eos> What is it?<eos> I don't know if I can keep employing you.
For?<eos> It was an ambush.<eos> For what it's worth, it was my dad who'd --<eos> Please don't.<eos> You're right. [ Inhales sharply ]<eos> I didn't know about it in advance, but if I did, would I...<eos> It's our wedding day.<eos> I'm not handling this very well.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um, I just wanted to tell you that I support your decision and I know it must have been very difficult for you.

You've always done it.<eos> Every day on the drive to school, never happy with how I did my hair or what I was wearing or who my friends were.<eos> This is my life, okay, Mum?<eos> These are my choices.<eos> Why can't you just let me be?<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> Ray?<eos> Hey, Tara.<eos> There's a new client for you.
These are my choices.<eos> Why can't you just let me be?<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> Ray?<eos> Hey, Tara.<eos> There's a new client for you.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm at St. Jude's now.<eos> I'll wait for you here.
Well, two women claim the same man's their husband.<eos> I don't know the legal term and all, but...<eos> No.<eos> That's bigamy.<eos> RICHARD: I can't stress the importance of this enough, Eric.<eos> This is very delicate, so I want to bring it down quietly.<eos> ERIC: Quietly?<eos> We're talking about Corrine O'Brien here.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Which is why I'm sending you.
And, uh, what year did you get married?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Could you just give me one second, please?<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Could I just speak to Mr. Dunbar for a moment, please?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Did you pass her on to me?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Your office did.<eos> I'm telling you, I didn't know.
How can you leave him in the hands of that woman?<eos> I have to be with him.<eos> Come on, Julie.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> The surgeon will come and find you, Mrs. O'Brien.<eos> He would like a word.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Nowhere.<eos> Hiya, Da.<eos> He can't hear you.
No, I didn't!<eos> Who do you think I am?<eos> !<eos> What is this?<eos> Have you been staying here?<eos> Little bit.<eos> I trusted you.<eos> You get out as well.<eos> What?<eos> Ray, I'm firing you.
Oh, you do make me laugh.<eos> You're ridiculous.<eos> Caroline.<eos> Tara.<eos> Can I borrow him for a bit?<eos> He's all yours.<eos> I've been thinking about us working together again remembering how it was I felt about you.<eos> Same here.<eos> It's kind of caught me off guard, you know, just how sensitive you've been about the whole Corrine-and-Julie situation.<eos> I have to say, it's been making life difficult for me, seeing you that way.
What's with the smile?<eos> Happiness.<eos> -You gonna say hello?<eos> -Nope.<eos> You take me for granted?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You could make a case that being taken for granted might just be the best thing in the world.<eos> Um, someone called Eric was in earlier looking for you.
It's like riding a bike.<eos> Oh, I hope it'd be better than that.<eos> Hi, Dee.<eos> Hey, Ray.<eos> How's it going?<eos> You left your brain at the flat.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> -Keep me posted.<eos> -Stop it.<eos> Ray, do you remember when I employed you, I said it would be for two weeks?
That was nearly six weeks ago.<eos> Yes, but I am indispensable.<eos> I know I've just had a nice payday, but I don't know. This whole going-out-on-my-own thing has been feast or famine.<eos> I just don't know if I can pay you a regular salary.<eos> That's a relief.<eos> I thought you were sacking me again.<eos> Am I not?<eos> No, 'cause I'll work for nothing.<eos> You can sort me out when you get the next payday.<eos> I have a new client for you.
You need to leave me alone.<eos> Why?<eos> You never said it was over.<eos> It's over.<eos> You're just saying that.<eos> This is crazy.<eos> We're great together.<eos> You know that.<eos> No, I owe you, Eric.<eos> You know, if I hadn't caught you with Caroline, I-I would never have this office.
I'll do it -- if you're sure it'll work.<eos> I can't guarantee that.<eos> The word I used was "chance."<eos> This way, we have a chance.<eos> Well, how big?<eos> A choice between a chance and nothing.<eos> How am I meant to tell Lydia?<eos> What do I say to her?<eos> I mean, like, how I'm abandoning her, how I'm betraying her?<eos> From what Ray has told me, the last few years have been incredibly challenging for you.
Really?<eos> How'd you swing this?<eos> -It's Tara. -[ Keys jingling ]<eos> Oh!<eos> What do you think?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Nice.<eos> And can be in back, kick a ball and stuff.<eos> Also, I have to coach you.
Who told you that?<eos> Don't throw away a promising career over a selective and misguided sense of loyalty.<eos> Your boss is going down, so why not finish Chuck off yourself and earn some Justice points with the deathblow?<eos> So, we're finally gonna have the talk?<eos> Well, you've been reaching out to me for five years.<eos> This isn't how I like to do it.<eos> You prefer the house?<eos> It's more intimate.<eos> For a seduction?<eos> When you ask a person to invest his money with you, that's a seduction.
Your father is.<eos> That's what couldn't wait till morning?<eos> No. He stashed $12 million in an offshore account.<eos> I know.<eos> You knew about this?<eos> He didn't do anything illegal.<eos> He didn't stash it.<eos> Moving money that way is not a crime.<eos> It's just bad PR.<eos> But what is it that really bothers you, Bryan?
These are just the initial questions I'm gonna be asking Axe.<eos> I'm giving him a little Rumble in the Jungle at first.<eos> Bomaye.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm gonna do all that, you understand, at the deposition.<eos> But I got to say it again...<eos> It should be cold, clinical.<eos> You're worried I'll say something.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Anything unscripted from you could put you in an even deeper hole.
I did the best I could.<eos> That's what there was to get.<eos> It can't be where you live.<eos> You'll need to keep going after Boyd.<eos> No.<eos> You can't get blood from a C. E. O.<eos> If I'm out of a job, then I can finally earn some of that money everyone's always talking about.<eos> I'm sure you know what you're doing.<eos> You have to protect the parent-child relationship.<eos> Anyone else in the world will fuck you over... friends, lovers... bosses.
You mean benefiting you more than anybody else?<eos> As much as.<eos> Not more.<eos> People noticing you have a new favorite.<eos> They're not happy about it.<eos> Anybody who makes me money is my favorite.<eos> Uh, look, Axe, I know I'm late.<eos> You missed the Sandicot meeting.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Went fine without you.
Oh, what?<eos> You think I learned nothing from Al Gore?<eos> We kept them on the edge of their seats, didn't we?<eos> I guess that means the system is working.<eos> I guess it does.<eos> You're about as tough an opponent as they come, Francis.<eos> Well, I've had a lot of practice.<eos> Now, you be sure to give my regards to Hannah and the children.<eos> Thank you, Mr. President.<eos> I'm... sure I'll be calling on you for advice in the very near future.
Me as well?<eos> You are another York princess whose children could be heirs.<eos> - Well, who will I be wed to?<eos> - I don't know yet.<eos> Will I live near Westminster?<eos> You'll not make me go away from Teddy?<eos> I have told Henry I shall influence the matches.<eos> His mother will not be let loose to match you all with beasts or peasants.<eos> I will make a stand against his mother.<eos> I will do my best for you.
No.<eos> Teddy could never...<eos> Maybe not. But my enemies don't know that.<eos> And he is a York heir.<eos> Lizzie, please.<eos> Help him.<eos> If Burgundy is behind this, then prove that they are wrong.<eos> Cecily will be married soon.<eos> Let us have Teddy at the wedding.<eos> If we show that he is living with us, a valued member of our household, then he cannot be in Burgundy raising men against you.
He is well.<eos> I would have brought him but...<eos> Henry doesn't know you're here?<eos> No.<eos> Look at you, Anne!<eos> How much you've grown.<eos> I swear you're almost as tall as me.<eos> How did you get in?<eos> The monks.<eos> They let you through?
There's something that I wish to ask you.<eos> Do not fight.<eos> You would have me stay here?<eos> Let them storm the gate?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Lead your men onto the field but do not risk your own life.<eos> Do not fight in person.<eos> If I died, you would be rid of me.<eos> Your mother safe, your cousin free to take the throne.<eos> How can I prove to you that I am with you, except to ask you not to die?
Come home.<eos> So we can start our life together.<eos> Charge!<eos> You go ahead.<eos> Could you take him?<eos> Of course.<eos> Thank you.<eos> "My dearest Lizzie."<eos> "Yes, I have the means to write"<eos> "and I know how that will hurt you."
You paint me with your own sinful desires.<eos> Leave me.<eos> Lizzie!<eos> I have a message from my husband.<eos> We have won.<eos> Mother lost again.<eos> My husband says the King has granted us permission to leave court.<eos> We shall go and live at his castle in the north.<eos> I hope you will be happy.<eos> I think I will be happier than you.
Black.<eos> I wish to keep it plain.<eos> You must wear a sword though.<eos> I thought this was to win their hearts not threaten them with bloodshed?<eos> Your subjects are still reeling from the battle and the change of House.<eos> The wounds of England will take time to heal.<eos> There may be skirmishes.<eos> The Yorks are routed, Henry.<eos> They are gone.<eos> There is none to come against you now.
My Progress will travel via York and grant a royal audience there.<eos> York?<eos> Henry...<eos> I will not have them thinking I'm afraid.<eos> Dear Francis Lovell, our lives are very changed since the last time that we met.<eos> But I should like to see you as I travel via York on progress with the king.<eos> What is your name?<eos> Ruth, Your Grace.<eos> Ruth.<eos> If I asked you to convey a letter, could I trust that it would not reach Lady Margaret or the King?
Lady Margaret said I was to keep her safe.<eos> No.<eos> No notes.<eos> What is it, Maggie?<eos> Nothing. It's just...<eos> I wish there was news.<eos> Dear wife.<eos> I had imagined I would write of triumph on my Progress, my impressions of my country and my countrymen,<eos> but one week out of London, there's a blade stuck in my flesh by a York named Francis Lovell.<eos> I imagine I have you to thank for that so you will be irked to hear that despite your best endeavors, your husband and the father of your unborn child still breathes.
Lizzie, where are you going?<eos> To do what someone should have done already.<eos> How long must I be cooped up here?<eos> I should have ridden out with Jasper.<eos> Henry, you are the King.<eos> Is this what it means then, is it?<eos> Crouched here in the darkness with my mother like a coward.<eos> Tell me, is this how you saw it? When you willed me to be the King of England?<eos> If you are dead then you are king of nowhere.<eos> Even a mother's love cannot pull you from the grave.
You knew of this.<eos> My Lady the King's Mother writes to me with news.<eos> She told me it would be for Henry's safety.<eos> Cecily, he is our cousin.<eos> And Henry is my brother-in-law and King.<eos> So if I must choose within my family, I would rather choose the side that I am afraid of. Get out.<eos> Get out!<eos> I will make sure they let him out.<eos> You can't.<eos> They will lock you up if you two try and leave the palace.
Or was it yours?<eos> He is a York boy.<eos> They were calling for him, shouting that they would support him over me.<eos> You know the answer.<eos> If you want their love then you should release him.<eos> Will you please allow my mother from that room?<eos> I must assume I cannot trust her.<eos> So I am to be separated from her?<eos> Do you really think she has your best interests at heart, Lizzie?<eos> Teddy is no threat to you.
But no harm will come to Arthur.<eos> No harm will come.<eos> You said yourself he is strong.<eos> He's strong.<eos> Dowager Elizabeth.<eos> Please, come with me.<eos> Teddy! Teddy! Come here.<eos> It's all right.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I am sorry we have not come to see you, Teddy.
Please, come with me.<eos> Teddy! Teddy! Come here.<eos> It's all right.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I am sorry we have not come to see you, Teddy.<eos> I had a baby boy and Maggie helped me.<eos> I had little baby Arthur.<eos> Can we go now, Maggie?<eos> I'm so sorry you're here.<eos> We are trying to bring you home.
Can we go now, Maggie?<eos> I'm so sorry you're here.<eos> We are trying to bring you home.<eos> Cousin Lizzie will be queen soon.<eos> And she has told the King that you shouldn't be here.<eos> Because it's a mistake.<eos> And when you are free, we shall go and live together somewhere quiet. In a little house far away from kings and castles.<eos> Well, you'll be home soon, Teddy.<eos> I promise.<eos> I love you, sweetheart, I love you.
I feel as though I've aged 1,000 years.<eos> I wonder if he'll feel the same.<eos> If he does succeed me to the throne.<eos> My enemies may see to it that he does not.<eos> Don't say it.<eos> Never say it, Henry.<eos> What have you decided?<eos> Will you see your mother?<eos> She has paid a monk to let me in.<eos> But if you make him angry, if he catches you...
I mean, you land it, you're minted.<eos> My part is done for now.<eos> What the fuck.<eos> Hang for a minute, Bryan.<eos> Listen to what Bobby has to say.<eos> Come work for Bach's firm, on my account.<eos> You know what Rhoades is, Bryan, and I know you made that call.<eos> What did you do to get Axelrod to drop his civil suits?<eos> I went back to work at Axe Capital.<eos> I'm happy that it works for you.
It's not, Uncle Bru.<eos> It's not, Mr. Axelrod.<eos> And you, sir.<eos> - I'm gonna be sick.<eos> - You should be... because you know who you really hurt with this move.<eos> There was no move.<eos> You fronted like the whole thing was wired.<eos> Was that bait? Or were you the bait?<eos> I swear.<eos> If you didn't set Mr. Axelrod up, who set you up?
If I did, you would know it.<eos> You and I have been at this a long time.<eos> You wouldn't even consider a candidate without vetting him first.<eos> I thought Alex had a future.<eos> Yeah, a run for the presidency as I understand it.<eos> He's clean and crisp as a starched white shirt.<eos> You're gonna have to make a decision, Mark.<eos> You wanna work for me and Claire, or not?<eos> I have already reached out to members of my own party.<eos> I've used my political capital to help you.
At her core, she has a core.<eos> Bless her.<eos> This whole Homs initiative might be too difficult for her.<eos> You know... you're very hard to read.<eos> Which makes sense.<eos> For the last several years, you've been a familiar face.<eos> Must get exhausting.<eos> Must be hardly any people you can even share a laugh with.<eos> You should figure out how to take full advantage of me.<eos> I can help you get what you want.
Whatever you think.<eos> We'll let Walker plead the Fifth.<eos> Then we'll regroup and make sure we're on the same page.<eos> Okay.<eos> We need to head back.<eos> "Beware entangling alliances," Mr. President.<eos> You know, that quote is often attributed to Washington, but it was actually Jefferson who said it.<eos> Anyway, I wanted to catch you before, uh, Mark and your lawyer got here.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> I know this hasn't been easy for you.
Actually, I will answer the congressman's questions.<eos> Please, ask your question.<eos> Under your administration, millions of dollars were illegally laundered from Chinese businessmen to affect American elections.<eos> Is this true?<eos> That's true.<eos> And can you tell us what, if any, was then Vice President Francis Underwood's involvement in this scheme?<eos> Well, it appeared to me, he was one of its chief architects.<eos> And, uh, what exactly do you mean by that, sir?<eos> It was his idea.<eos> Mark, I think you need to be elsewhere right now.
- We use what's already there.<eos> It enables us to look and listen in on every computer and every cell phone of everyone working for us.<eos> We'll set up a satellite office limited to Mr. Stamper and myself.<eos> Assistant Director Green and I will bring whatever is valuable forward.<eos> I want direct access.<eos> Live streaming.<eos> I assure you, Mr. President, we'll bring you anything of substance.<eos> Do it.<eos> And needless to say...<eos> I report only to you, sir.
Maybe someone staying at the hotel or working there took it.<eos> You'll let me know?<eos> Yeah. Sure.<eos> Mark... the vice president and I have discussed it and... we've come around to your position.<eos> Very good.<eos> Uh, considering the news that's breaking, it's not going to be quite as easy.<eos> Any idea where this story came from?<eos> No, not yet. But I will soon.<eos> I'll let it be known that you're open to censure.<eos> And you should be aware. It's not surprising. Romero is moving over to the Judiciary Committee.

But I will soon.<eos> I'll let it be known that you're open to censure.<eos> And you should be aware. It's not surprising. Romero is moving over to the Judiciary Committee.<eos> Well, why wouldn't he?<eos> He wants to see this through. He's still coming after me.<eos> Hmm, well, I imagine leadership from both parties has had enough of him.<eos> Yeah, I don't want to diminish this. We are in damage control.<eos> Claire, I think... it might be best for you to stay out of this as much as possible.

I will defend the president.<eos> Vice presidential business as usual is the way to play it, I think.<eos> You need to trust my instincts on this one.
Tom's not even here anymore.<eos> Francis asked you to follow him?<eos> I'm concerned about someone.<eos> Laura Moretti.<eos> I know about her... and her husband.<eos> Your behavior shows poor judgment, Doug, and could be a liability for the president.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Give these to Francis when he gets back.<eos> I can get you immunity.<eos> You just need to tell the truth.
I think it should be you.<eos> - I didn't ask you what you think.<eos> - You need to be armed, Claire.<eos> It's important that you can walk away from anything that happens to him.<eos> They can kiss my ass. I got an offer from Senator Westervelt.<eos> I'm looking, too.<eos> But it's getting harder and harder to get off this ship.<eos> Where is my wife?<eos> Where has she gone?<eos> If she was your wife, wouldn't you wonder?
I'm here for you, sir.<eos> Always.<eos> Do you have concerns about Mrs. Underwood?<eos> - Do you?<eos> - I would never say that.<eos> I want to show you something.<eos> There's 45 minutes where I can't account for her whereabouts.<eos> I don't know where she went or who she saw.<eos> But she lied to me.<eos> I, uh... I think you should get some rest, sir.
It's a senseless partisan circus.<eos> My focus is to remain doing my job, which is to ensure prosperity for the American people, and to try to achieve...<eos> I'm sorry, how did you say it again? Peace?<eos> - Salam.<eos> - Salam...<eos> That's what we're trying to broker here.<eos> So let's give the president time to meet with Colonel Ismat.<eos> I'll take follow-up questions in the press briefing room.<eos> Maybe I'm being too literal, but that's the sea at night.<eos> - Do you like it?
- You mean LeAnn?<eos> Ms. Davis will speak to her later this afternoon.<eos> You heard the president.<eos> Uh, I'm still at the White House.<eos> - Once we get into Syria... - Sir, my name is Sean Jeffries.<eos> - I work with...<eos> - Yes, I know who you are.<eos> Sean...<eos> I know what Tom Hammerschmidt is working on.<eos> Mr. Jeffries, if you need an appointment, I can arrange one...
Hello?<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> - Who is this?<eos> - Come on, you must know by now.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> - Aidan Macallan.<eos> Look into how he used and abused the FISA ruling.<eos> How do we know each other?<eos> Now come on.<eos> If I told you that, how can I possibly keep helping you?
How do we know each other?<eos> Now come on.<eos> If I told you that, how can I possibly keep helping you?<eos> And don't you want me to help you?<eos> But where do we meet?<eos> - In the muck.<eos> - Wait.<eos> Zoe Barnes' death was not an accident.<eos> Doug Stamper killed her.<eos> But you already know that.
An overwhelming amount of Underwood material was reported by social media users in counties that he was expected to lose.<eos> But anyone I reach out to does not wanna be talking about this.<eos> The leak said it was unauthorized domestic surveillance.<eos> All the administration has to say is "terror," and they seem justified.<eos> He wasn't rooting out terrorists. He was trying to win an election.<eos> And very convenient that the Secretary of State hits her head.<eos> - Now you sound like a conspiracy...<eos> - I'm not a conspiracy theorist.<eos> I try to imagine what it's like inside his mind, what I would do if I were him.<eos> And I'm telling you, it is all sorts of...
There are huge sections blacked out, Tom.<eos> You portrayed us like a couple of monsters.<eos> - I never used that word.<eos> - You didn't have to.<eos> On the flight back from Moscow, not long after we met...<eos> You and Francis had a fight.<eos> A real knock down.<eos> I told Francis I heard the yelling, but not the words.<eos> But... you said you were murderers.<eos> He said you were survivors.
- Can you prove any of it?<eos> He's implied that he did it.<eos> I can speak to his behavior.<eos> Things that he's done.<eos> You need to go to the US attorney.<eos> Seth, if you don't, I will.<eos> "I told the president there were four men by the same name the State Department was tracking.<eos> Two in the United States."<eos> So said a senior White House source, as quoted in the Washington Herald.<eos> Were you aware of this conversation?

"I believe the president understood that the Muhammed Kalabi in Tennessee was not a legitimate threat."<eos> Was this conveyed to you in any way?
Were you aware of this conversation?<eos> No, sir, I was not.<eos> The source went on. "I believe the president understood that the Muhammed Kalabi in Tennessee was not a legitimate threat."<eos> Was this conveyed to you in any way?<eos> Again, no, sir.<eos> Still, the committee's looking forward to Secretary Durant's testimony on this matter.<eos> I have no idea what the secretary will say or not say, but I... have great respect for her and wish her a speedy recovery.<eos> We were operating off of facts and reports coming in at an accelerated rate that day.<eos> I'll try this again.<eos> Did the president indicate to you at any time that he knew this was not a threat? No.
Or maybe I should wait until I lose the Senate...<eos> I just think there are other ways...<eos> If you give up executive privilege, we lose leverage.<eos> We lose it all.<eos> Tell the chair I'm ready to appear.<eos> I mean, the damage your testimony could do to your wife is not worth the risk.<eos> Oh, its worth is what we're here to discuss. I don't appreciate being the one to tell you this, but... your presidency is beyond repair.<eos> You don't know what I'm going to do next.<eos> Isn't that it?<eos> Isn't that what really bothers you?
You don't care for me very much, do you?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I couldn't care less.<eos> But if you make Claire happy, that makes me happy.<eos> - If you can help her, good.<eos> - What's it worth to you?<eos> Well, what kind of deal are we talking about?<eos> For me not to testify.<eos> Well, I have contacts outside the Beltway.<eos> I can set you up in any number of lucrative positions.
But you can't help yourself.<eos> Make me an offer, Ms. Davis.<eos> What is she worth to you?<eos> A lot.<eos> So then here's what I'm thinking.<eos> Do you solemnly swear and affirm that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.<eos> Let the record reflect that the witness has answered in the affirmative.<eos> Mr. President, I want to thank you for appearing... and I hope we get to clear some things up for the American people.<eos> Mr. President, the floor is yours. You can take as long or as short as you like.

If you have any written statement, we will include it after and it will be part of the record.<eos> - Mr. President, you are recognized.<eos> - Thank you, Mr. Chairman... and to the other members of this committee.<eos> I have agreed to appear before this committee today... because... I'm guilty.<eos> Guilty of having spent the last 30 years of my life here... in this Congress. In this House.<eos> Then as vice president and now as president, trying to do the people's work.<eos> Now, this committee has accused me of a great number of things.<eos> You accused me of pay to play.<eos> And so I accuse you of exactly the same.<eos> I also accuse you of playing politics only when it suits you.
Perhaps to try to fill the small hole in your soul that you sold off a long time ago?<eos> - Mr. President.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> This is my opening statement, and I will give it in full.<eos> I am not done, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> You accuse me of breaking the rules, and I tell you, I am playing by the rules.<eos> The very rules that you and I all agreed upon.<eos> The very rules that you and I all wrote together.<eos> So, yes, I'm guilty as hell, but then so are all of you.<eos> Yes, the system is corrupt, but you wanted a guardian at the gate like me.

You've loved it.

Oh, Congressman Romero,<eos> I just wanted to see you one last time before I leave.<eos> I don't believe there's anything left to be said.<eos> No, not between us. Not any longer.<eos> I just wanted to thank you for... your tenacity.<eos> Whatever you're up to, you won't get away with it.
- Because this is bad, Claire.<eos> - This is very... very bad.<eos> My God!<eos> What is it with you two?<eos> - If there's something on your mind, say...<eos> - In my house? You left him in my house? !<eos> Lower your voice, or at least change your tone.<eos> Did you take care of it?<eos> Yes, that's what I do.<eos> Then thank you, and well done.
Doug Stamper would do anything for the president.<eos> He saw a threat in Zoe Barnes, who the president was involved with.<eos> And he took care of it.<eos> He's threatened my life on numerous occasions.<eos> - But to go back to my question...<eos> - No, ma'am.<eos> I don't think the president knew what Doug was up to.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Mr. Hammerschmidt.<eos> I've been meaning to call you.
You understand I can use your refusal in print.<eos> Yes.<eos> Were you on the Cathedral Heights D.C. Metro platform the day of Zoe's death?<eos> Any questions regarding Zoe Barnes, you need to speak with my attorneys.<eos> Did Zoe Barnes make a call to Francis Underwood from a burner phone when he was congressman?<eos> - Why would you ask me that?<eos> - Why won't you answer?<eos> I almost always answer the president's phone.<eos> Calls, texts...<eos> Do you have any knowledge of those texts?
- This is it.<eos> - I want to follow up, that's all.<eos> I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss.<eos> And in their struggles to be truly free, in their triumphs and defeats, through long years to come, I see the evil of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural birth, gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out.<eos> Surface-to-surface missiles delivered sarin at about three o'clock in the morning, our time.<eos> Moscow has already issued a statement condemning the rebels for orchestrating the attack on themselves.<eos> - And did they?<eos> - Of course not.<eos> Petrov will use this to justify air strikes.<eos> I'd like to show you an image.
At some point, someone is going to imply that he is still making the decisions.<eos> That wouldn't be good.<eos> - I'll advise her. She'll come around.<eos> - I hope so.<eos> Because if she doesn't act now, when it comes to Syria, her presidency could be in danger.<eos> - And your future in doubt.<eos> - Oh, don't threaten me, Ms. Davis.<eos> I don't threaten.<eos> I just try to remain as clear as possible.<eos> You offered me your services, and I offered you mine.

I was here before you and I'll be here after you.<eos> And regardless of that, let me remind you... that nothing is more dangerous than me.
The answers are case-sensitive and exact.<eos> You won't get a second chance.<eos> - And the middle one?<eos> - My favorite baseball player?<eos> "Wade Boggs." Two G's.<eos> And the last? "What did you leave in that hotel room in Austin?"<eos> Where is my gun?<eos> Here you go.<eos> What guarantees do I have?<eos> I gave you your gun back.

"What did you leave in that hotel room in Austin?"<eos> Where is my gun?<eos> Here you go.<eos> What guarantees do I have?<eos> I gave you your gun back.<eos> But what made you give it to him? I'm curious.<eos> I thought he was in danger.<eos> And now you think what?
And Claire knows how loyal you are. I'm sure of it.<eos> So, what did you leave in that hotel room in Austin?<eos> A bracelet.<eos> Oh, that's too bad.<eos> You know, I finally got a look at what Macallan passed on to Ms. Harvey.<eos> I was shocked to realize the degree to which you and your husband stole this election.<eos> I need to be honest with you. I've been in talks with him about helping him start a foundation of some kind.<eos> In exchange for influence over you.<eos> Interesting.<eos> I'm trying to help you navigate this transition.

We don't even know if we're gonna charge him yet.<eos> I did it.<eos> Let's get going.<eos> Who do you have on her cabinet?<eos> Right now, they're just suggestions.<eos> Oh, come on. We both know how this works.<eos> You've already made your choices.<eos> You wouldn't be worth your salt if you hadn't.<eos> I just want you to run them by me first.<eos> Look, I can make this transition easy for you or not.
I'll be in Dubai by tomorrow afternoon.<eos> And our deal stays in place.<eos> Yeah, hold on a second.<eos> - Ready? - Go ahead.<eos> Yes.<eos> Ms. Harvey has her gun back.<eos> Macallan's files are with the president.<eos> Any hard evidence connecting you to the election... is in her hands.<eos> Then LeAnn's job is done.<eos> If you have anything to say, now is the time.
- Yes, sir.<eos> I was surprised, too.<eos> I had thought it empty ever since Lady Greenwood passed away.<eos> Hello?<eos> Toronto Constabulary.<eos> Pardon, Miss!<eos> OK, come on, everybody, into the house.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Well, this is odd.<eos> - You do lack subtlety.
Forgive me, sir, but you seem more disturbed than ever.<eos> She told me of a man who caused all this.<eos> A man named Hector Coleman.<eos> - I will find him straightaway.<eos> - No need.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Years ago.<eos> How could I have been so unaware?<eos> My sister was in distress and I suspected nothing.<eos> You were only twelve years old.
- We need a man on the inside.<eos> - You mean a woman.<eos> And I believe that can be arranged.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm Freddie Pink.<eos> A woman named Muriel told me about this place.<eos> Come in.<eos> I met Muriel last week, at a church.<eos> St. Stephen-in-the-Fields.<eos> I'm so sorry to... have to tell you this, but Muriel has died.
When you remove the inherent struggle of a woman in an unfriendly world, she is different.<eos> She is whole.<eos> We all share the chores here.<eos> Some of us like to cook, others would rather dust.<eos> Perhaps you'll join the soap makers.<eos> - You make soap? - Hm!<eos> Lovely soap.<eos> The great debate is whether to sell it on the outside.<eos> I wouldn't want to go back out there.<eos> You won't have to.
Norman Bruce's suitcase.<eos> Perhaps Mr. Bruce found his wife, he arranged to meet with her, claiming only that he wanted to return her belongings.<eos> But instead of all the doings and what-have-yous, he put the explosives into his suitcase, set the timer, and watched her walk away.<eos> Watts get a photograph, have the constables distribute it all over the city.<eos> Norman Bruce is our prime suspect, Murdoch.<eos> - I want him found.<eos> Carry on.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Miss James, could I have a word?<eos> What can I help you with, Inspector?

Men. Allowed.<eos> Please, Miss, just a few questions.<eos> Get away from these gates before I find a shotgun.<eos> - Llewellyn, what are you doing here?<eos> - My job.<eos> Wait for me in my salon.<eos> Please, Miss Athena.<eos> We were hoping to speak with you directly.<eos> Ask your questions.<eos> No, you may not come in.
Miss Pink?<eos> Miss Pink?<eos> Why are there police here?<eos> Who were they looking for?<eos> Those policemen are investigating poor Muriel's death.<eos> They are not permitted within the gates and will not try to enter again.<eos> How can you be so sure?<eos> It's their world.<eos> We're just pretending we're not in it.<eos> Do you like it here?
- You've proven that?<eos> - No, not me.<eos> Nettie Stevens.<eos> She's an American on the brink of publishing her findings.<eos> The "accessory" or "X element" chromosome is, in fact, the female determiner.<eos> Women are the default of nature.<eos> Are you... trying to manipulate babies?<eos> Not quite.<eos> You might actually understand my work.<eos> What I'm about to show you is not for everyone.
It's Demeter's.<eos> She told me that she is attempting to eradicate the male species.<eos> One at a time?<eos> - You betrayed us.<eos> - How could you lie to us like that?<eos> - A girl's got to make a living.<eos> - Miss Pink.<eos> For what it's worth, I am sorry.<eos> Get out.<eos> You don't need the goddesses.
- Please, cooperate. - You can't.<eos> I won't allow it.<eos> This is a crime scene, and I am the police.<eos> Whatever authority you think you have means nothing to me!<eos> How did Mr. Bruce come to be in your cupboard?<eos> I would like to know that as well.<eos> Do you deny killing him as a means of eradicating men?<eos> I'm not a killer, I'm a scientist.<eos> Then how do you propose to reach your goal?<eos> I'll try to explain it to you, but don't expect to understand.
Who could miss it?<eos> Toronto's first apartment building.<eos> My brother is making a fortune at the expense of our family legacy.<eos> How nice for him.<eos> So you admit to the plot then?<eos> Muriel was a loyal friend.<eos> May she rest in peace.<eos> But I had nothing to do with what she did.<eos> Please take off your gloves.<eos> This is proof that you handled the TNT, that you... made the bomb that killed Muriel Bruce and you will be charged with her murder.
But in fairness, she didn't choose you, either.<eos> Your face is... symmetrical.<eos> But... that hat...<eos> I offended him, I think...<eos> I think that was his attempt at a compliment.<eos> Miss James?<eos> - Inspector! - Oh!<eos> Miss James.<eos> I feel the need to right a great wrong.<eos> Mr. Desmond wasn't stepping out on you.
I didn't expect you could.<eos> I thought you might want this.<eos> It belonged to Muriel.<eos> Goodbye, Llewellyn.<eos> Goodbye, Clarissa.<eos> Sir.<eos> The truth is absolute, unyielding, and eternal, Jackson.<eos> It is our one constant in a turbulent universe.<eos> Yes it is, sir.<eos> Here, I thought you could use this.
What did she say?<eos> Uh, basically, she traded you for Bruce Wayne.<eos> Okay, maybe we should just end this.<eos> Wait, hang on.<eos> I just want to point out to everyone here, this is a man who is going to great lengths to better himself.<eos> Even at the risk of... being humiliated.<eos> And I, for one, think that's very brave.<eos> Thank you, Howard.<eos> Honestly, I'm surprised you two didn't wind up together.<eos> Well, like you gals, I had to suffer through him to find Bernadette.

I hear that you are something of a jazz aficionado, Mr Chambers.<eos> Er... I wouldn't say 'aficionado'.<eos> I also hear that you are modest to a fault.<eos> The gossips have been out in force.<eos> Everyone has been very positive.<eos> Well... mostly positive.<eos> 'Mostly positive'.<eos> I'll take that.<eos> As you are aware, my predecessor was erm... dispatched after some...
- There's nothing going on.<eos> Don't think I've ever seen you happier.<eos> With the little miss here...<eos> I suppose we all are.<eos> But how long do you think it can last?<eos> With your job, and her down the road?<eos> You can't be a vicar and be with her.<eos> You can't marry a divorced woman.<eos> That's the truth of it.<eos> Sooner or later, you'll have to make a choice.
- Ivy died at the home, in her sleep.<eos> That's what everyone assumed.<eos> Aunt Ivy's heart gave out, Dr Atwell said.<eos> And you had no reason to doubt him?<eos> She was old. She was frail.<eos> Your aunt and the doctor...<eos> - They were close?<eos> - No.<eos> But... we know they worked at the home together.<eos> Well, then, you have your answer.

Well, then, you have your answer.<eos> I'd offer you tea, but you won't be long, I'd imagine.<eos> - Can we see your aunt's room?<eos> - That won't be possible.<eos> Let me rephrase that.<eos> Show us her room, Miss Franklin.<eos> Dad, we've got visitors.<eos> It's his lungs.<eos> Dad's always suffered with them.<eos> When your aunt died... nothing struck you as odd?
- It's not for a woman.<eos> Andrew?<eos> What did we say?<eos> - Fingers on lips.<eos> - Fingers on lips.<eos> Veronica Stone.<eos> Please.<eos> No gifts, I'm afraid.<eos> It's hardly a gift.<eos> Keep your voices down, if you don't mind.
No.<eos> No.<eos> Why did you burn the letter?<eos> And I thought you were here because you wanted to be.<eos> So, where did this letter come from?<eos> He was at Aunt Ivy's funeral.<eos> People were ever so generous.<eos> We made nearly £30 for the home.<eos> But then I saw the letter.<eos> It was addressed to you.
Confirms Tom Lewis died from a severe trauma to the head.<eos> Time of death between 10 and 11 o'clock.<eos> Which corresponds with him leaving Catherine's Bar and his boat leaving harbour 40 minutes later.<eos> Yes, but more importantly, the lab also confirms the blood Dwayne found on the steps leading down to the cabin does indeed belong to our victim.<eos> So you were right.<eos> He was killed in the hold and his body moved on deck later on.<eos> You look like you've been busy.<eos> I'm afraid my evening wasn't quite as romantic as yours.<eos> I spent it going through the victim's financial records.<eos> I don't suppose you came across any mention of a City Met Bank?
She wouldn't be the first person whose partner had led some sort of double life.<eos> So what do we do?<eos> Well, what do we have, Florence, I mean, or rather, what don't we have?<eos> Erm... a bag of cash that's gone missing.<eos> And a possible second phone we never found.<eos> Oh, and we now also have a new, unknown suspect.<eos> The person Lucy heard Tom arranging to meet the night he was killed.<eos> Exactly.<eos> So who is our mystery suspect?<eos> - Oh, we might be able to help you with that, sir.
Florence, get Sophie Boyd on the phone and see what she knows about these four businessmen.<eos> Sophie says Tom only met two of the four men in Catherine's Bar that night.<eos> And she has no idea what one of their company badges was - doing on Tom's boat.<eos> - OK.<eos> - Bit of a problem, Chief. - Oh.<eos> This is the four men's hotel.<eos> - But they all checked out this morning.<eos> - What? !<eos> They got the first flight back to London at 6am.<eos> Well, did you manage to get any of their details?
And on the island as a whole, as though we can't cope.<eos> Well, yes, there is that, sir.<eos> You'll be pleased to hear I've spoken to the Governor,<eos> - who has spoken to the Home Office. - Yes?<eos> We can send a small team from Saint Marie to the UK to work on the case in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police.<eos> They've agreed for you and your team to question the suspects - under the supervision of one of their officers.<eos> - Well done, sir.<eos> You are to liaise with a Detective Inspector Jack Mooney when you arrive.<eos> There's a flight leaving for London Heathrow at two o'clock this afternoon. I've approved the cost of you and two other officers.<eos> I suggest you start packing.
Likewise.<eos> Only I was perhaps expecting you in the flesh.<eos> Oh, yes, sorry, no, I'm just down the corridor in IT.<eos> Only you asked me if we could set up a video conferencing link so you can talk to your team in Saint Marie.<eos> - Er, yes, yes, I did, yes.<eos> - Well, here it is.<eos> Well, obviously I'm not in the Caribbean, I would've taken my jacket off for a start!<eos> No, I'm on my own, you see.<eos> So to test it out, I had to make a call and answer it myself.<eos> Er, well, now that it's working, maybe you should, erm, er, er...
- DI Goodman.<eos> - Humphrey, please.<eos> And this is Florence and Dwayne.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Jack.<eos> We were just starting to look through the notes.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Let me run you through it.<eos> You're wondering what an egg has to do with your case.
It's your logo, I believe.<eos> Looks like a badge or something.<eos> It's part of a cufflink.<eos> I had a set made for all of us, to commemorate the trip.<eos> Cufflink, I see.<eos> - And you, er, you all have a set of these?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And how many pairs were made?<eos> - Just the four. - Four.<eos> Well, then you should know... this was found on the boat where Mr Lewis was murdered.
- No, of course not.<eos> All our bookings are made in advance on credit card.<eos> Do you know if your partner had a second mobile phone?<eos> I'm sorry, why are you asking me these questions?<eos> Miss Boyd, can you answer, please?<eos> No, he didn't have another bloody phone, OK?<eos> What's all this about?<eos> OK.<eos> Since we last spoke to you, we got some new information that your partner was seen with a large amount of cash and making a call from a phone we can't trace.<eos> Now, would either of those things mean anything to you?
I'm just doing further background checks on the deceased, sir.<eos> And how is that going?<eos> Yes, er, fine, sir.<eos> I mean... I've only just started.<eos> I know I need to go further back.<eos> But I haven't worked out a way to do it.<eos> Well, you may find it's easier to work forwards than back.<eos> - Start with his passport.<eos> - Really?<eos> It will not only give you the date but also the place of his birth.
I promised I'd go and look up my Auntie Lilibeth.<eos> Oh, you've family here?<eos> Yes, my Auntie Lilibeth and her husband James came here in the '60s.<eos> - I, of course, was just a young boy.<eos> - Of course.<eos> OK. So...<eos> Hackerny?<eos> - Hackney?<eos> - Yes, Hackerney.<eos> - Yes, I think you'll probably need to get the Tube.
Are you sure you don't want to tell Emma<eos> - what you're doing?<eos> - Well, we know what she would say.<eos> She wouldn't let us take the risk.<eos> I agree with David.<eos> We have to do this now.<eos> So, how does this work?<eos> Sorry, but this is going to hurt.<eos> The curse's magic, split between both halves of your shared heart...<eos> It's what keeps you from being awake at the same time.
Don't look so surprised.<eos> I practically invented Dark Magic.<eos> But worry not.<eos> I won't force you to do anything.<eos> When you join me, it will be because you want to.<eos> Is that why you're here?<eos> Because I will never join you.<eos> Oh, when the darkness comes, you'll change your mind.<eos> And then, Rumplestiltskin, we can finally be the family we were always meant to be.<eos> Can I help you with something?
Is that why you're here?<eos> Because I will never join you.<eos> Oh, when the darkness comes, you'll change your mind.<eos> And then, Rumplestiltskin, we can finally be the family we were always meant to be.<eos> Can I help you with something?<eos> I almost didn't recognize you without the scales.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Oh, cut the act.<eos> There is no way you would let yourself fall under the power of Regina's curse when she's still awake.<eos> You don't seem very well.
Enough games.<eos> I put my daughter through a wardrobe because you told me it would break the curse.<eos> Now, where is she?<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about, and I don't appreciate your tone.<eos> Intimidation won't make me remember something I don't know.<eos> I guess Snow was wrong.<eos> Looks like we're gonna have to find Emma on our own.<eos> Emma?<eos> What a lovely name.<eos> Perhaps I can help you.
No sign of him by the water.<eos> They haven't found him in the South Woods, either.<eos> We should move the search party into town.<eos> We can't go back into town.<eos> And why not?<eos> Because John Doe may still be in the woods somewhere.<eos> We haven't looked everywhere.<eos> Miss Blanchard's right.<eos> We haven't checked the mines.<eos> Dr. Hopper, why don't you and Pongo go have a look?
You know what to do!<eos> You're late.<eos> I was worried.<eos> We have to hurry.<eos> Regina's onto us.<eos> It won't be long before she finds out.<eos> Did you bring it?<eos> Rumple said its magic is strong enough to lead us to Emma.<eos> Let's go find our daughter.<eos> I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.<eos> It appears we've only been cursed for 10 years.<eos> She's still 18 years shy of her 28th birthday, the day she's destined to become the Savior.<eos> No, she doesn't have to be the Savior anymore.<eos> We're awake.<eos> Well, Snow White and Prince Charming may be awake, but the rest of this town is very much asleep.<eos> Find Emma now, and she will never fulfill her destiny, the curse will never be broken, and everyone will be trapped here forever.<eos> What do you expect us to do... just leave her out there?<eos> Drink this, like I'm going to.<eos> It'll put you back under, and then, when the time is right,
It can open a door to Hook.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because we once used Pixie Dust to find you when you were a little girl.<eos> What?<eos> If we had gone through with it, Emma, you would have grown up with us.<eos> We would have been a family.<eos> You wouldn't have become the Savior.<eos> You wouldn't be fighting the Final Battle now.<eos> I get it.<eos> You had to do what was right for everyone else before yourselves.
No!<eos> Emma.<eos> No.<eos> - Emma.<eos> - Dad.<eos> You woke us up.<eos> How?<eos> It was easy.<eos> We just all shared a tiny bit of your curse.<eos> I take it Emma hasn't told you my secret.
And how do you handle a responsibility like that?<eos> Took me a long, long time to come to grips with it.<eos> My father... your grandfather... Ethan Cahill, he's still alive.<eos> You'll meet him soon.<eos> He ran away when he was told.<eos> It's all right.<eos> You'll come around like we all did, because it's who you are, Lucy.<eos> It's your legacy.<eos> You know, not a day goes by that I don't think of you.<eos> Would you please stop pretending that you actually care about me?
They say they're in charge now.<eos> Who said that?<eos> Matter is, they've been checked and double-checked and triple-checked.<eos> - Now, all of these people...<eos> - Who authorized all these people?<eos> I did.<eos> Everything's under control, Agent Christopher.<eos> Is it?<eos> And you are?<eos> I'll leave you two to get acquainted.
More later, obviously.<eos> Jake Neville, NSA.<eos> Here's my badge. And my Homeland Security clearance, and a letter from Deputy Secretary Ledgett.<eos> This project's command was taken over by the National Security Agency at 0900 hours.<eos> My team and I are just getting up to speed.<eos> So NSA is taking point, and no one bothered to tell me?<eos> After Logan went on his joyride, a decision was made to get fresh eyes on the project.<eos> And the buck stops with me, so it seems.<eos> Look, between you and me? Wasn't your fault.<eos> You're getting a raw deal.

He's right.<eos> Best case, you spend all night in a police station, answering questions.<eos> Worst case, they try and pin it on the two American strangers.<eos> How's that gonna find Lindbergh?<eos> It's my fault.<eos> It's not your fault. It's Flynn's.<eos> How are we gonna find Lindbergh now?<eos> You know, this is the part where Wyatt would say something annoying, but he'd be right... and... pull it all together.<eos> Yeah, well, we don't have a Wyatt, we don't have a Dave, and we don't have a soldier.<eos> You need a... uh, you need a soldier, you say?
He is the bravest man I know.<eos> - And the drunkest.<eos> - No. Absolutely not.<eos> - No.<eos> - You may not know this, but I fought in the Great War.<eos> - You were an ambulance driver.<eos> - I took shrapnel.<eos> You have had too much to drink.<eos> No, absolutely not.<eos> I'm gonna make this easy on you.
Hey, look, this is to your last week as a free man.<eos> Booyah! Why don't I just give you guys the bottle?
Hey, look, this is to your last week as a free man.<eos> Booyah! Why don't I just give you guys the bottle?<eos> - Sounds good to me.<eos> - Works for me, Dad. - Hey, whoa.<eos> Hey, Mr. Nichols, Trev told us you were in 'Nam back in the day.<eos> Smack in the middle of primetime, 1968.<eos> - Man, that must've been rough. - Yeah.<eos> - Let me tell you squids a story.
He was getting married.<eos> His buddies tipped me 50 bucks to slip him my thong. And that's all?<eos> Trevor wanted to hang out after I got off of work, so I took him to a fight club.<eos> The one in Humboldt Park on Le Moyne?<eos> That's right.<eos> I thought he just wanted to watch, but once we got there, he said he wanted to fight, so they set up a match for him.<eos> He kicked some dude's ass.<eos> I wasn't planning to hook up with him, but after he took his shirt off and dominated in the ring, I was like, "Come to mama."<eos> Seriously?<eos> You should've seen him.
They live in Iowa.<eos> Let's see if they'll come in for a chat.<eos> When the charity called and told her to get out of the Ukraine, she called us and said she couldn't just abandon those poor people.<eos> They wanted a $5 million ransom.<eos> Can you imagine?<eos> I mean, we have a ten-year-old pickup.<eos> Were any of you in Chicago last week?<eos> No, no.<eos> This is our first time.<eos> We heard the SEALs who tried to rescue Kathryn paid you a visit.
Sometimes my eyes glaze over.<eos> Careful.<eos> We have a vet upstairs.<eos> Do you think Soto and Benjamin will tell their lawyer about Operation Omega?<eos> We'll see.<eos> If Olson comes in begging for a plea deal, he knows.<eos> If he wets his khakis when we screen the video for him, he...<eos> Peter Stone?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - We're seeking to enforce a writ of replevin against you and your office.
The Government's application for a writ of replevin is denied.<eos> I got to say I did not see that coming.<eos> Chalk one up for the underdogs.<eos> Good news. The writ was denied.<eos> The video is in.<eos> Except you're not going to use it.<eos> You heard me.<eos> Why?<eos> Personal experience has taught me military secrets should stay secret.<eos> With all due respect, just because you served in Vietnam doesn't give you a monopoly on national security protocol.
Do what I'm telling you, or find a new job.<eos> Mr. Stone?<eos> Peter.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> What's on your mind?<eos> Came to pay my respects.<eos> Could've done that at the house.<eos> There's also something I thought you should know about Trevor.<eos> If it's something I'd rather not hear...<eos> The Navy didn't tell you the truth about Omega.
I held Trevor back as Jake picked up the knife off the floor, and all of a sudden, Jake spun around and landed a kill strike to Trevor's thigh, to his femoral artery, just like they trained us to do.<eos> Then we took the knife,<eos> Trevor's laptop, the book pages, a couple other things to make it look like a robbery, and we... we just left Trevor there on the floor, and we got the hell out of there.<eos> You made a plea bargain with Mr. Stone for a lighter sentence, didn't you?<eos> That's right.<eos> Did you inform him that you had a personal motive to kill your friend Trevor?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, he was marrying your ex-girlfriend,<eos> Mia Jones, correct? Yes, but-<eos> - Did you tell Mr. Stone that you're still in love with Mia before he offered you the deal of the century?
How'd you find this place?<eos> One of our people saw the live stream.<eos> We took an educated guess that Harley Johns was behind it.<eos> The tracker we planted in his truck led us here.<eos> Where is he?<eos> - Well, he escaped.<eos> - How'd that happen?<eos> Said the person who showed up late.<eos> Hey, listen. I've got a business proposition for you.<eos> Why don't you swing by the Post?
I have a friend from college who's an intern at St. Thomas.<eos> There's been a couple of cases of some SARS-like virus they can't identify.<eos> - They say it might get bad.<eos> - All right, dig into it.<eos> Get back to me when you got more.<eos> Scoot.<eos> Oh, nice of you to grace us with your presence.<eos> So, any update on your "wingnuts who believe in zombies" story?<eos> There have been a few developments.<eos> You might want to make some room on the front page.
Was heading back up to the party when it happened.<eos> Can anyone confirm that?<eos> No.<eos> What about you, Mr Thomas?<eos> Where were you when the gunshot went off?<eos> I was in this room, trying to get everything straight - for the contract signings.<eos> - I see.<eos> So, none of you have an actual alibi for the time of the murder?<eos> But we don't need one, do we?<eos> You didn't get to sign the big deal, then, after all, did you?
Now, why has he not told us that, do you think?<eos> That's very deceitful.<eos> Frank was a family friend when I was a teenager.<eos> How did your family know him?<eos> Well, it was my mum, really.<eos> Er, Frank was our neighbour.<eos> It was years ago now.<eos> Frank lost his licence for drink-driving.<eos> Anyway, my mum was out of work, so Frank employed her to be his driver until he got his licence back.<eos> Do you mind me asking, Steve, how old were you at the time?

Do you love her?<eos> My grandfather told me a story once, about these two wolves fighting inside all of us.<eos> And one of them is anger, envy, self-pity, regret.<eos> The other one is love, truth, faith, hope, that sort of thing.<eos> And I asked him, which one of the wolves would win?<eos> And do you know what he said?<eos> "The one you feed."<eos> For all you know, she's thinking, why would you want to see her?<eos> You know, when you've got this marvellous life out in the Caribbean.<eos> Look, if he moves, I'll call you straight away.
And the moment the deal was signed, you'd both stand to lose £100,000.<eos> So?<eos> That's how it goes in the City.<eos> The smart guys always hedge their bets.<eos> That's all that we were doing.<eos> It's standard practice.<eos> And do you really think that Martin would be so stupid as to use his own gun to commit murder and then fail to wipe the prints off afterwards?<eos> Good point.<eos> So maybe the real killer used Mr West's gun to frame him?<eos> Look, I know that I'm innocent, so maybe you should be looking elsewhere.
There's even a contacts list.<eos> Any mention of Steve Thomas?<eos> Well, I was going through it, sir, when I...<eos> Fell asleep?<eos> But we don't need to mention that on my appraisal.<eos> Do we... sir?<eos> I suggest we crack on.<eos> Don't you?<eos> There you go.<eos> Thought you might be in need of a little sustenance.
- Yes?<eos> - The Commissioner's on conference calling.<eos> - Says he's got something.<eos> - OK, Commissioner.<eos> - Inspector...?<eos> - Yes, sir?<eos> - Are you there?<eos> - Yes, what have you got for us?<eos> It turns out we found a memory card hidden in a box on Mr Lewis's boat.<eos> Officer Hooper has e-mailed one particular photo over to you.
Meet me at the office in half an hour."<eos> I like it.<eos> And send.<eos> Have you got eyeball on our suspect yet?<eos> Yes, Chief.<eos> The eagle has landed.<eos> The eagle has landed.<eos> Ah, Florence!<eos> OK, so what is it you want us to see?<eos> I thought you might be interested to meet Frank Henderson's killer who is coming up in the lift right now.
Wow!<eos> Look at this.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> It's incredible.<eos> Very kind of Humphrey to let us have his house like this.<eos> I told him you needed a holiday.<eos> Well, I have to say, a change of scenery is very nice indeed.<eos> - There you are.<eos> - Ah, cheers.<eos> Oh, there's a pet lizard we should tell you about.
- No, a regular one.<eos> - Everyone, you will go in the rooms and you will go right now. Don't make me count to three.<eos> - Shh, shh, shh.<eos> - Hey, Captain, what's up? - Uh, which room is Sergeant Jeffords?<eos> - Oh, Terry's in here with me and Amy.<eos> You know, we're just having a low-key night watching "House Hunters International."<eos> This orthodontist really wants to live in Panama with his strangely old wife and won't say why. - Can I talk to him?<eos> - Uh, let me check.<eos> - Yeah, no, he's asleep.<eos> - Can I help you with something?
- Jake, Holt's laptop isn't here.<eos> It's gone.<eos> - Where are you on my graphs? - The presentation is<eos> - I'm definitely all done, but I'm worried, if you're going up against Jeffrey, will color be enough?<eos> I was thinking, slide transitions.<eos> - Oh, good grief.<eos> Very well. You may add cross dissolves.<eos> But so help me God, Jeffords, if I see even one star wipe... - I just need a half an hour.<eos> - Perhaps I should supervise.<eos> - No, you should clear your head.

- No, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm not interested.<eos> - What?<eos> - No.<eos> - Guys, earpiece fell in.<eos> - What on earth took you so long?<eos> - Yeah, where the frigging hell were you?<eos> - I was trying to get the colors right, but in the end, I decided to just go with your original black and white.<eos> - It's probably even one color too many.<eos> Anyways, in you go.
Well, that's strange.<eos> Next slide.<eos> Next.<eos> Next.<eos> Oh, I see what's happening here.<eos> Uh, due to an issue with the Internet cloud, you are seeing a series of pictures that have nothing to do with me or the 99th precinct.<eos> - I don't get it.<eos> - Who even took these pictures?<eos> - I did.<eos> You guys should really be a lot more careful about leaving laptops lying around.
Mr. Durning, took advantage of the situation to raise his own political profile.<eos> Thanks to them, I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this chair.<eos> If you're saying that there's some confusion about the true causes of their deaths...<eos> I suggest you consider karma.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> Mr. Kotite's difficult to read.<eos> Name me a sociopath who isn't.<eos> He was aware of the three deaths, but did not take responsibility.<eos> So, we're still not sure we're looking at three murders.<eos> Is this all that you and Kitty managed to find regarding Cy Durning's passing?
Well, you've done it now, you've made my list of sitters.<eos> "Aunty Watson." I like it.<eos> You know Sherlock used to call me that?<eos> Of course, I was "the Anti-Watson."<eos> I mean, after everything you've been through, I mean, you're a mom now, it's amazing.<eos> So why wouldn't you, uh, tell us about Archie?<eos> Why keep him a secret?<eos> I know what you two are like.<eos> You're going after a man who's financed three murders.<eos> The second you found out I had a baby on board, you would've benched me.
I mean, I understand why you'd be nervous, but respectfully, I think you're selling him short.<eos> I mean, he deserves to know that you're happy.<eos> Right?<eos> Dr. Wilkerson, I'm Detective Bell.<eos> You already know my colleagues.<eos> Why am I looking at a picture of a man who was shot to death?<eos> Oh, she does recognize a murder when she sees one.<eos> We thought you were gonna say we're looking at the work of the world's biggest flea.<eos> I owe you a Coke, Watson.<eos> Does that man look familiar to you?
No.<eos> So you've never seen him before?<eos> No.<eos> You're positive?<eos> Does "no" mean the same thing in New York that it means in New Jersey?<eos> Just answer the question.<eos> I've never seen that man before.<eos> Well, that's funny because Detective Bell met a witness last night that says that that man paid a visit to your morgue last week.<eos> He talked to you for a while.<eos> Our witness couldn't make out the details, but if we had to guess, he was offering you money to help him cover up the murder of Cy Durning.

We want Kotite and his assassin.<eos> You tell Detective Bell here everything you know about them, and who knows? You might dodge a prison sentence.<eos> No.<eos> There is no witness. You're making him up.<eos> The day you met with the man in the sketch, you had a coffee stain on your lab coat, right here.<eos> Does that sound like a detail we made up?<eos> Are you arresting me?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> Then I'm leaving.<eos> You should know, Dr. Wilkerson, we are seeking a warrant for your financial records as we speak.
And we love you and we care about you, so this guy better measure up.<eos> Does he have a name?<eos> Steve Quinones.<eos> Detective Steve Quinones, works narcotics.<eos> You're marrying a cop.<eos> Ugh. I swore I would never date another one after Joe.<eos> You deserve happiness, Angela.<eos> I mean that.<eos> Thank you, Frank.<eos> I should let you get back to work.
No.<eos> And there is no "when in Rome" clause, I'm guessing.<eos> No.<eos> Then what's the morning line on them handing him over?<eos> We're already getting flooded with calls from the press on this case.<eos> We will handle all press inquiries.<eos> What are the odds?<eos> They're slim, okay?<eos> Then I don't like 'em.<eos> And what you like and don't like is not really the issue here.
And what you like and don't like is not really the issue here.<eos> It is to me and the people of this city.<eos> That counts.<eos> Commissioner, you must release Mr. Nejjari and void this arrest.<eos> This case is not your business.<eos> When a child is in danger in my city, it is my business.<eos> It's not my fine print.<eos> It's international policy as sanctioned by the United States government.<eos> Now I have reached out to Morocco and I am investigating these charges.<eos> And I will let you know what comes of it.

- And great job.<eos> - Have a good night.<eos> You too.<eos> All right.<eos> Welcome back to One PP, Deputy Secretary.<eos> What is this?<eos> Well, every so often, I get off on the wrong foot, especially with my colleagues from Washington...<eos> Please. I'm not your colleague.<eos> So I try to show a little extra courtesy if and when we meet again.<eos> And how much does that actually work for you?
It's not crap, Ms. Sanders.<eos> You remanded Malik into foster care?<eos> No, our system did.<eos> And now State has a problem with the Moroccan government.<eos> That's your business, deal with it.<eos> Don't come crying to me.<eos> I am dealing with it.<eos> There is a hearing set up for family court.<eos> They will never uphold keeping the son of a foreign diplomat in foster care, and you are going to stay out of it.<eos> I don't take orders from you.
and because Child Services can't enter the apartment...<eos> We could talk to the school.<eos> School's always gonna side with Child Protective Services.<eos> The only person left is the mother.<eos> Coming from that culture, you really think she'll contradict her husband?<eos> No. But what other choice do we have?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Detectives Reagan and Baez.<eos> Need to ask you a few questions about the Nejjari family.
I apologize for the invitation.<eos> Apologize? Yes. I really overstepped.<eos> I... Steve and I were going over the final numbers, and I realized I hadn't heard back from you, and when I told him, he blew up.<eos> About what?<eos> That I'd asked you to the wedding.<eos> He said it would look like you were invited to feather his nest, that you were smart, and you'd see right through that.<eos> He said that?<eos> I know you don't know Steve, but he would never in a million years try to pull something like that.<eos> And never in a million years would I think that.<eos> Thank you for being kind.
And if you didn't knock, how about some manners?<eos> How'd you even get that up the stairs?<eos> I said to myself, "I think I can, I think I can."<eos> And then I couldn't, so... I paid two men who promised not to come rob us later.<eos> Okay, look, Sheldon, the Colonel wants us to make the guidance system smaller, and we can't do it without you.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Well, so I was right.<eos> Open a window.<eos> It's about to get smug in here.<eos> Well, I would love to help you, but since I discovered the satisfaction of working with my hands on a train engine, I don't think I can go back to theory.
I got an anonymous package detailing... files a-about every aspect of your operations, and--<eos> And your payment?<eos> I received a credit stick.<eos> It's in my apartment.<eos> It's in the-- the lining of a red silk dress.<eos> Now, my husband-- where is he?<eos> He's married.<eos> He remembers you as you were.<eos> To show him what you've become would be devastating.<eos> I'm not gonna tell you where he is.
Find where he's transmitting from.<eos> Get the location to Ressler.<eos> Tell him to breach.<eos> Well... you're a many of many skills, Mister...<eos> Well, whoever you are, I need those skills.<eos> Count me out.<eos> Like him?<eos> I know who you are, and that you're willing to kill me if you have to.<eos> But you don't know who I am.<eos> And I am not someone who's gonna help you commit a crime.
for some sort of facility.<eos> You know, center systems, RFID tracking, - security doors.<eos> - Do you know where?<eos> The Architect-- he made them launch a cyber attack on a power grid in Southern Virginia.<eos> - Where in Southern Virginia?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Look around though.<eos> This-- This guy kills people.<eos> Once he gets what he needs from Aram, he's gonna kill him, too.<eos> I know you said you didn't want to be disturbed, but you have a guest.
The man is one of the great living artists.<eos> He rarely does portraits.<eos> He's very selective in who he portrays with his brush.<eos> David, it's a painting.<eos> What I'm talking about is life and death.<eos> The last three paintings he's done-- one is hanging in the Whitney, one is in the Tate Modern, one is in the Pompidou.<eos> I could be hanging in the Pompidou if you would just get the hell out of my house.<eos> Now go, please.<eos> - I owe you an apology. - Oh!<eos> You can't come in here!
You can't come in here!<eos> - I lied to you.<eos> - Get out.<eos> I'm not Frank Carraro with Project Innocence.<eos> I'm Christopher Hargrave-- the boy you convinced your son to say he killed.<eos> I'll call the police.<eos> I know about the quarantine, his illness.<eos> You were the only one who had unsupervised visitation.<eos> I am warning you--<eos> How much were you paid, and by who?
Tell Polpetto I'm a great admirer of his work.<eos> Mm, not so much his nudes.<eos> They're a hair splayed for my tastes.<eos> And that I do apologize, but I require his services.<eos> Rapimento.<eos> What you are witnessing, Warden, are solid titanium rods traveling at Mach 7--<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - It's not important who I am.<eos> What's important is that I have control of your prison.<eos> Once you release Lonnie Perkins, I will return that control to you.
- If I set him free, more innocent people are gonna die.<eos> Just open the gate.<eos> Please, don't--<eos> What is that?<eos> Oh, that's-<eos> - I-I don't-- I-I-<eos> - No. - No, please--<eos> - Well, what do you think you're doing?<eos> Nothing-<eos> - I just-- If you shoot me, you'll never be able to open the gate.
Actually... there were the last three Super Bowls.<eos> Right, and every St. Patrick's Day.<eos> A lot of green... well, anyway.<eos> My name's Luke Fox, and my associate Mr. Barnes and I happen to be members of a progressive think tank where we come up with creative ways to help the less fortunate.<eos> - Uh-huh. - We do that in our spare time.<eos> We're both CEOs of Fortune 500 companies by trade.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Every month we select a brain-damaged teen or adult to experience an all-expenses-paid wilderness adventure at our lodge in Big Bear.<eos> We'd like to invite you guys and Adam to be our guests.<eos> Yeah, and you better bring your appetites, 'cause we eat breakfast for every meal!
Did you see any animals?<eos> It was awesome.<eos> I thought I saw a raccoon.<eos> - Oh. - But it was just a plastic bag.<eos> Sorry we're late, because we didn't have any cell service<eos> - so we lost directions.<eos> - Oh, yeah, sorry.<eos> No cell service.<eos> But you get used to it.<eos> It helps you unplug and unwind, yeah.
There are three of them.<eos> Listen, I can't talk right now, but we might need more bullets in case they run. - Everything okay?<eos> - Everything is great.<eos> Yeah, uh, what was that about the bullets?<eos> Sometimes Mr. Barnes organizes hunting expeditions up here during the week.<eos> I'm sure the call was about that, right?<eos> - That's exactly what it was.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> - Makes sense.<eos> Why don't you go put your gear down while we prepare lunch?
- Two at the most. - Aram:<eos> No. That can't be true.<eos> I need you to find the pharmaco-toxicologist who, I believe, crafted the deadly cocktail and get the antidote from him.<eos> What do you know about him?<eos> There's a man, he told me he's known as...<eos> The Apothecary.<eos> A druggist whose potions hijack the immune system causing any number of allergic reactions. Each one impossible to identify, unless you know what to look for.<eos> An exotic venom might replicate a drug overdose, a personally tailored allergic reaction might trigger cardiovascular collapse.<eos> The Apothecary can create embolisms, aneurysms, inhibit respiration, induce paralysis.<eos> All of the assassins you know about share one common disadvantage when it comes to avoiding apprehension.
His largest competitor got firebombed.<eos> Their offices completely destroyed.<eos> Two days later, Panetti paid 200 grand to an associate, we still don't know who, for services rendered.<eos> Competition over.<eos> How do you know? We flipped his accountant. A woman named Helen Dahle.<eos> She's the one who cut the check, and she was prepared to testify that Panetti ordered her to make payment for the Arson hit.<eos> Few days before trial, she goes to dinner, has a mysterious allergic reaction to the food, and, wham, she's on life support and so is my case.<eos> We think we know how Panetti got to her.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> We are gonna need you to put us in touch with Helen Dahle's doctors.
And she's not improving.<eos> Is that her husband?<eos> Dr. Ralston: Yeah, Robert Dahle.<eos> He and Helen's parents haven't left her side.<eos> One minute, she's heading to a client dinner and everything is fine, and the next, she's...<eos> Like this.<eos> This client dinner, who was there?<eos> A friend of Helen's from college.<eos> The police have already cleared her.<eos> What did Helen tell you about the case against Panetti?

Not me or anyone who works for me.<eos> You asked for this meeting and we agreed.<eos> Please tell me it wasn't so you could hurl baseless claims that you can't prove at my client.<eos> We know about the Apothecary.<eos> We know that he specializes in untraceable toxins, and that you hired him to create that allergic reaction.<eos> What is she talking about?<eos> You can play dumb, Mr. Panetti.<eos> From what I hear, you've made quite a profession out of skirting responsibility for your actions. - Now, hang on.<eos> - We can find him on our own.<eos> And when we do, you'll realize that this trial you're facing is a small matter when compared to what happens when the full force of the FBI comes down on you and your organization.
Are you serious?<eos> Humor me.<eos> Last night.<eos> Before you threw me in the car and drove here.<eos> Yeah, I...<eos> Who lives here?<eos> How would I know?<eos> I got here in a trunk.<eos> Right.<eos> I know this is an unusual, Frightening predicament, but I assure you, I mean you no harm.
What is your name?<eos> Lou Lou.<eos> Lou Lou Mclellan.<eos> Hey, hey, can you be careful with that thing?<eos> Was I alone last night? Or was I accompanied by anybody? My associate...<eos> Dembe.<eos> No...<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You need a doctor.
Elizabeth. Someone who'd miss you if you died?<eos> Reddington: I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Tell me your name again.<eos> Lou Lou.<eos> Lou Lou.<eos> You saved my life, Lou Lou.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Like I needed a dead body on my conscience.<eos> You were in bad shape.
Maybe.<eos> Tell me your name again.<eos> Lou Lou.<eos> Lou Lou.<eos> You saved my life, Lou Lou.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Like I needed a dead body on my conscience.<eos> You were in bad shape.<eos> Well, worse shape.<eos> You try to hide it, but you're scared.
- Why?<eos> - Damned if I know.<eos> But while you were asleep, I found out the name of the guy that lives in that apartment.<eos> Marvin Gerard.<eos> You know him?<eos> He's my Attorney.<eos> Ressler: It's over, Brooklyn.<eos> Robert told us everything.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You've been on the hook, what, two, three years? waiting for him to leave Helen for you.
You finally figured out that the only way that you'd ever be with him was over Helen's dead body.<eos> And so you made a plan.<eos> Poisoned her.<eos> I'm not saying anything until I have a lawyer.<eos> She's in a coma.<eos> Robert hasn't left her side.<eos> - Guess he changed his mind.<eos> - That's not true. Ressler:<eos> Well, he told us that you poisoned his wife.<eos> Now, if that's not true, you better tell us what really happened.
You know that woman treats him like a servant, right?<eos> He's carried that Princess's baggage for nine years, and he couldn't take it anymore.<eos> So, you planned it together.<eos> No, I told him I didn't want anything to do with it.<eos> Ressler: But you knew what he was doing.<eos> See, that makes you a co-conspirator.<eos> Now, if you wanna reduce your jail time, you're gonna tell us exactly how he did it.<eos> How did he put her in a coma?<eos> Brooklyn: I don't know how it works.<eos> You're gonna need to tell us what you do know.
I just know that he gives it to her twice a week.<eos> Who did he get the poison from?<eos> Brooklyn: He never said.<eos> But I can tell you where he keeps it.<eos> What the hell? Hey. Hey.<eos> You have no right to come into my...<eos> No knock, search warrant.<eos> I have no idea what you're looking for, but I guarantee you're not gonna find it.<eos> Unless you wanna parade that on your perp walk,<eos> I suggest you get dressed. Robert:
Did you find an antidote?<eos> There were no medical records. Nothing about Reddington on file.<eos> Wait, why are we looking for baby stores?<eos> Hightower's wife thinks he's out buying nursery supplies.<eos> She's pregnant.<eos> I thought she was Comatose.<eos> Which is when he assaulted her.<eos> Cooper: My God.<eos> The closest one is Abeebaby in Harding.<eos> Sending you an address now.
You ever trip over one of those things in the dark?<eos> They're lethal.<eos> - Reddington.<eos> - Elizabeth, where are you?<eos> Asa hightower, the Apothecary, we have him in custody, and we found his lab.<eos> Have you identified the toxin?<eos> The lab's working on it.<eos> Not yet, but they will.<eos> Elizabeth, I found the wine that was used to administer the poison.<eos> One of my men is bringing it to you now.

Elizabeth, I found the wine that was used to administer the poison.<eos> One of my men is bringing it to you now.<eos> If the Apothecary doesn't tell you what you need to know, the bottle will.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're gonna be okay, Reddington.<eos> Reddington?<eos> Reddington!<eos> All right, let's keep this simple.<eos> We have two questions.<eos> Who paid you to poison Reddington, and how do we cure him?
I merely provided the means for someone else to do so.<eos> I've never poisoned anyone.<eos> I'm sure your wife would disagree.<eos> My wife was running around with Clive Hollis.<eos> I'm just sure about it.<eos> She needed to be subdued.<eos> She's a very confused woman, but she'll come around.<eos> Come around to what?<eos> The fact that you repeatedly raped her?<eos> Having raided my facility, you're in possession of information that will help you solve well over 20 cold cases and bring others out of various altered states.

But they couldn't touch each other?<eos> No.<eos> He advocated for her, agreed to take responsibility for her quarantine, see to her needs.<eos> We agreed to a year-long break from testing in exchange for Malik submitting regular reports.<eos> Until you called, we had no idea they were gone.<eos> The reports kept coming in, so we assumed they were still at the house we'd provided.<eos> It turns out, they moved out months ago.<eos> You didn't check on them?<eos> We wanted to respect their privacy.<eos> If you need anything further from me, please don't hesitate to call.
The CDC confirmed the victims of the armored truck robbery died of Luschen's.<eos> Witnesses saw a 2006 dark red Ford van, partial plate... 7-Mike-Echo-6.<eos> Okay, the vehicle is registered under a Alec Moore.<eos> That's him.<eos> He must've registered the car under an alias.<eos> - Okay, pulling up his address...<eos> - Samar, Ressler, get over there.<eos> Liz, pull together a Hazmat team.<eos> Have them meet them at the location.<eos> Can I help you, sir?
No, thanks.<eos> As I told your goons...<eos> Oh, tut, tut.<eos> Don't be uncharitable.<eos> These gentlemen are seasoned professionals like yourself,<eos> Monsieur Edgar...<eos> Legate.<eos> I don't insist on the Monsieur.<eos> That Saudi oil minister in Kuala Lumpur...<eos> How on earth did you manage that one?
On the ground.<eos> Get on the ground!<eos> Move!<eos> Stop, Natalie!<eos> Stop!<eos> Don't move.<eos> No one else has to die today.<eos> - Malik!<eos> - You need to come with us now.<eos> If you wanna stop me, you're gonna have to kill me.
Is that clear?<eos> I'm sorry to have put you in such a difficult position, Harold.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Losing someone we love is painful.<eos> Agonizing even unto death.<eos> The Japanese call it tako-tsubo... a grieving surge of... abnormal electrical waves that causes the heart to deflate... and contort until it resembles a... a fishing pot.<eos> Hollow and cold, an empty vessel at the... bottom of a fathomless sea.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss.<eos> You have suffered enough of that in your life.<eos> What do you want?
No, no.<eos> - Don't feel right.<eos> - Doesn't feel right.<eos> Hey.<eos> Um, I-I thought you'd be asleep.<eos> Nope. Not asleep.<eos> Actually, wide awake.<eos> Wondering where you were.<eos> What?<eos> I-I thought I told you.
I don't know, has some deeper meaning, like, there's a parallel between chicken parm, maybe, like, my father.<eos> How long?<eos> 'Cause you haven't slept.<eos> Fresh flowers, and this is not your standard greenery.<eos> No, these flowers come with a note.<eos> You have a boyfriend.<eos> Looks like we are out of time.<eos> Aw, come on, Doc.<eos> All right.<eos> So, does... everyone in the department have to come see you at least once?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<eos> I wish I knew more.<eos> I...<eos> That's fine.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We... You know what?<eos> We're gonna just head in, and get started.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry for your... loss.<eos> If there's anything you need, just please, um...
You know the doc.<eos> Hard to read.<eos> A quiet wreck.<eos> She's a little upside down right now.<eos> Well, I told her to take the day off.<eos> In the meantime, where are we with this case?<eos> Looks like I'm not the only one who disobeys orders around here.<eos> Maureen, you know you don't need to be here.<eos> I have patients later.<eos> Well, on behalf of the craziest of your patients, let me just say, if you want to take the day off...
I want to help.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> I was able to find some of the...<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll just come back later.<eos> What do you have?<eos> The helmet cam footage.<eos> It's a little choppy, and at the end it gets a little...<eos> Please, just play it.<eos> Doc, you don't have to do this.
After Dr. Cahill recommended to deny his parole, he lunged across the courtroom, and he shouted,<eos> "I will gut you like a fish."<eos> It still isn't him.<eos> Okay, well, I'm gonna have.<eos> Riggs and Murtaugh look into it, - just to be sure.<eos> - They're gonna need backup.<eos> Riggs and Murtaugh?<eos> I'll float that by them.<eos> Are you Kevin Flynn?<eos> Yeah, what the hell do you want?
Riggs and Murtaugh look into it, - just to be sure.<eos> - They're gonna need backup.<eos> Riggs and Murtaugh?<eos> I'll float that by them.<eos> Are you Kevin Flynn?<eos> Yeah, what the hell do you want?<eos> Um... Is there maybe another Kevin Flynn inside there?<eos> Like, a bigger one or something?<eos> Or is Snow White around?<eos> Look, we are LAPD, and we want to ask you some questions.
But you know I won't.<eos> - Right?<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> Saving us all some time.<eos> Did you kill a man on Monday morning?<eos> I'm gonna kill you once I...<eos> No, you're not.<eos> You're a paranoid-aggressive, and you threaten... that's your thing.<eos> So where were you Monday morning?<eos> I don't have to tell you.
No, but you want to.<eos> You don't want to go back to prison, because then who would take care of Nana?<eos> Is that what you don't want to admit?<eos> You were with Nana on Monday, weren't you?<eos> She needs me.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> I understand.<eos> We'll check with the floor nurse.<eos> I'm sure she'll vouch for you.<eos> I told you, he's not guilty.
I don't believe this.<eos> Y-You're not worried I have a stalker. You're worried I'm dating?<eos> Leave.<eos> I'm here because I care.<eos> Look, I get it, Maureen.<eos> You're still angry about Vegas.<eos> It was one night.<eos> It was more than one night.<eos> You know what?<eos> You both need to leave now.
Honey, your father and I... look, we've been worried about you.<eos> And we were wondering, is there anything that you want to say...?<eos> What is this?<eos> I'll tell you what is is.<eos> It's a fake I.D. Why do you have this?<eos> I got a job.<eos> I've been working for some DJs who helped me book some small gigs, but I need the I.D. to get into the clubs.<eos> A job?<eos> Why didn't you tell us?<eos> Maybe I thought you guys would freak out, interrogate my friends, ransack my closet.
It's your fault.<eos> All right?<eos> You want to send me to this new shrink.<eos> I go in there, 20 minutes later, they've done undone all that you done done for me.<eos> Right?<eos> So then I'm broken, like the planter,<eos> - which I planned on fixing, by the way.<eos> - Okay, this-this is... this is not funny, okay?<eos> So, you come on down from there.<eos> No, it's not funny, but maybe you should talk to the shrink that you made me to go who screwed me up, and I walked out of there, and I just wanted to get high,
He had some trouble in the woods last night.<eos> Nothing life threatening.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> But that thing is attacking us.<eos> It's attacking us near our home now.<eos> We're dealing with a bear, Yolanda.<eos> There's nothing to worry about.<eos> Salvador, everyone knows it's not a bear.<eos> When do we get the truth?<eos> My husband would not lie to you.
Yup, I'm right here.<eos> Morning, love.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Where you off to?<eos> I'm going down the lab to see the boys.<eos> I'm just trying to fit this Coady story into the mix.<eos> Yeah, making monsters with P.T. and Susan back in the day.<eos> Wish we could talk to Cosima.<eos> I know.<eos> You don't have to whisper.
Oh, well.<eos> That is the hustle, isn't it?<eos> How do you go about that?<eos> How do you gain someone's trust?<eos> You have to figure out what they want first.<eos> And then give it to them without them realising it.<eos> And what is it that Rachel really wants?<eos> The so-called Fountain of Youth gene.<eos> We're decades ahead of popular science.<eos> You're both lucky to be here.
You've grown quite fond of Kira, haven't you?<eos> She's a special child, but I assure you, I am unwavering.<eos> Good.<eos> After the surgery, I want you to bring her to the island.<eos> But we have the resources at Dyad to move on to the next steps.<eos> I'd prefer to have her here.<eos> It is our change of tactic with Sarah which has brought her in.<eos> On whose behalf are you arguing now?<eos> Your transport has been arranged.<eos> You know best.
Hey, hey...<eos> I've got this, Sarah.<eos> And I can't sit still, so I gotta come with you.<eos> - Don't move, Rachel.<eos> - Felix, I'm sorry for your loss.<eos> Save your bloody breath, you heartless bitch, and turn around.<eos> They took Helena.<eos> To the island, presumably.<eos> I wouldn't be so certain.<eos> Neolution will survive Rachel's betrayal, but the stress has taken its toll on you, so you should be cautious with this.
God, you look so rosey-cheeked.<eos> You're bounding up stairs!<eos> Yeah, I'm back... I'm back to bounding.<eos> Yeah, you are!<eos> It's fabulous!<eos> Now tell me, how do you feel about long stares and large groups of people?<eos> - Oooh...<eos> No.<eos> - If you're gonna show up, you're gonna show off, darling.<eos> My dear friends, may I present to you Metis!
♪ - Yeah.<eos> Loaded and ready to send to all the regulatory and oversight committees in the affected countries.<eos> As well as to old journalist friends of Siobhan at The Guardian.<eos> You guys did all this for us.<eos> You're ready?<eos> Just a second.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hello!<eos> And I'd also like to thank you all for buying.
This woman...<eos> - Felix!<eos> she chose us as her own.<eos> We are who we are because she carried two little London urchins on her wings to Canada.<eos> Watching her raise my sister, watching my sister raise her own daughter... finding my biological sister, it's quite mad.<eos> It's taught me that we are all... mysterious works of chance.<eos> A choice of nature versus nurture.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> So, to my galaxy of women, thank you for the nurture.
His name was Christopher Hargrave.<eos> Yeah, he didn't vanish.<eos> Can you tell me what happened?<eos> He died.<eos> Sir, that's not possible.<eos> What makes you think that?<eos> Because I'm Christopher Hargrave.<eos> Monsieur Leroy Bloom?<eos> Twenty-five years in Chicago, parking on the street, and my car gets taken in Monte Carlo.<eos> I'm telling you, my mother used to say,
B-a-2-0-4-t...<eos> R.<eos> God knows where they are now, and what they've done to my car.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, our fundraising efforts have once again exceeded our goals, allowing us to continue to help needy people in every country on earth.<eos> I now have the distinct pleasure to introduce the man behind all this good work.<eos> Our chairman, Dr. Justin Sperry.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good afternoon, friends.<eos> Isn't this a glorious day?<eos> I'm sure you all feel terrific.
It's okay.<eos> If we go now, we can make it.<eos> Please go.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Go.<eos> Whatever happens, whatever you do, just know your children will be cared for and your honor is intact.<eos> Raymond.<eos> No.<eos> Aram, we just touched down.<eos> We're heading to you now.
- This is nonsense.<eos> - Is it?<eos> Because my source was quite certain that Reddington has donated millions to your foundation.<eos> - You have no proof.<eos> - But we do.<eos> Our sources provided us with a boringly large number of financial documents detailing wire transfers between. Reddington's shell companies and the Sperry medical foundation.<eos> And the rest?<eos> This allegation that we've acted as some sort of personal courier for him to move contraband?<eos> That's a disgusting lie.<eos> And you know as well as I do that those bonds were planted in my doctor's suitcase.
Trust me, Dr. Sperry.<eos> No matter how Sterling your reputation, people will believe the most awful things.<eos> All right!<eos> All right!<eos> All right!<eos> All right.<eos> I'm glad we're on the same page.<eos> Let's get started.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen.<eos> Those of you who have been kind enough to support the Sperry medical foundation in the past with your contributions, and especially the brave and skilled physicians who have selflessly volunteered their services, I owe you all a heartfelt apology and a confession.
- The name.<eos> Unless I'm mistaken, Reddington is on your most wanted list.<eos> And to get him, we need to get the people close to him.<eos> The person who hired you knows who those people are.<eos> See, you want to hurt Reddington.<eos> We want to capture him.<eos> Seems like we both want the same things.<eos> I can assure you we do not.<eos> Well, you're looking at life in prison.<eos> So, maybe you help us, and we'll help you.

Yeah, I know that, Dad, but, after I talked to his C.O. out in Suffolk, that's when I found out that he'd been having trouble since leaving the job.<eos> Great.<eos> And you brought that forward, now you can get back to work.<eos> Right.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Ms. Bukowski?<eos> Detective Reagan.<eos> This is my partner Detective Baez.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Like to ask you a few questions about your husband.
Yeah, Detective Reagan, this is my partner, Detective Baez.<eos> Pleased to meet you.<eos> Let's...<eos> Is this gonna take a long time?<eos> I have a long list of patients today.<eos> You're a doctor?<eos> Yeah, a physician's assistant.<eos> Is this about one of my patients?<eos> Afraid not.<eos> Do you know this man?
Is this about one of my patients?<eos> Afraid not.<eos> Do you know this man?<eos> Seems like you do.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Lee Bukowski was found dead a few nights ago.<eos> Well, maybe there is a God, after all.<eos> He was murdered.<eos> Who works in mysterious ways.<eos> Let me save you a lot of time and trouble.
Only if you think you need one.<eos> I...<eos> What do you want?<eos> Well, we checked your phone records, Mr. Holt.<eos> Your cell phone pinged off of the tower closest to the murder scene.<eos> Actually, to clarify, it didn't ping the night of the murder, but as you can see from these records, your cell phone was in that area many times over the past few weeks.<eos> Which tells us that you were casing the scene, tracking Mr. Bukowski, getting to know his routine.<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> Okay, then why else would you be in the same place where the man you hate most in life was killed?
Yes, because I'm good at what I do.<eos> Listen, I don't know what's going on in here, but I'm leaving.<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> Get over there.<eos> I'm here as a courtesy.<eos> I'm not under arrest.<eos> Actually, you are.<eos> What?<eos> Please, don't say any more, Mr. Holt.<eos> Why don't you take a look at this, Mr. Holt?
Sorry.<eos> We're interrupting?<eos> Looks like we're the ones interrupting.<eos> Anezka and her friends are trade-show models for the tournament this weekend.<eos> They're here to take publicity photos with the team.<eos> You're police.<eos> Did Joey do something wrong?<eos> No, we just...<eos> We're clearing up a misunderstanding.<eos> Hey, why don't you, go hang out with the team, okay?
We're here to discuss the NYPD Mounted Unit, right?<eos> Ending equine slavery.<eos> While this meeting does have to do with your position as CEO of the Animal Salvation Fund, Ms. Karnow, horse emancipation is not on the docket, I'm afraid.<eos> Rather, we would like to discuss your campaign to end seal hunting.<eos> A selfie?<eos> Sealfie, actually.<eos> You and your group have branded seal hunting barbaric.<eos> But the so-called barbarians, in this modern day and age, well, they also have access to cell phones and social media, just like you do.<eos> You told me you wanted to talk to Raina about a crime.<eos> I think you should cut to the chase.
By threatening him in the comments section of his posts.<eos> "If you continue to support this senseless slaughter, you and your people deserve..." in all caps... "extinction."<eos> Two nights ago, this man was murdered with a seal-killing club that belongs to Tendu.<eos> The person who did this was trying to frame him.<eos> Not quite as drastic as killing him, but an effective way to silence his voice.<eos> Okay, this is crazy.<eos> The posts that you're referring to,<eos> Raina told me about them weeks ago.<eos> She regretted them and thought there might be consequences.<eos> But I'm gonna tell you exactly what I told her.
What?<eos> Well, I didn't tell you 'cause I thought if an attorney was there, it might scare him away.<eos> We met in my office, and we made a deal.<eos> I promised to support indigenous seal hunting if he would come out against commercial seal hunts.<eos> Commercial hunts killing 20 times as many seals as the Inuits.<eos> Yeah, last thing I would want is Tendu dead or in some kind of trouble.<eos> Can you prove any of this?<eos> I have a draft of the agreement at my office.<eos> We both signed it.<eos> I can send you a copy.
He's fine.<eos> Your arsonist was driving a fully-restored, vintage Ford Mustang, model year 1965, '66, '67 or '68.<eos> Color unknown.<eos> How can you know that?<eos> You say in your report you found a charred wastebasket inside.<eos> You thought it was used to splash petrol around the office.<eos> So?<eos> So, why did the arsonist use a waste basket?<eos> Why not a gas can?<eos> I'll tell you why.
Police are here.<eos> You're safe.<eos> Show your badge.<eos> You gonna tell me why I'm looking at a map of Canada?<eos> In a minute.<eos> We know what you do for a living, Mr. Godwyn.<eos> Your business card may say "legal investigator," but you're a fixer.<eos> When your law firm or their clients have a problem, you make the problem go away.<eos> You were suspected in the sudden, inexplicable death of the jury foreman on the Himmelman case.<eos> You were accused of threatening witnesses in Brust v. Zerakem, bribing a judge in the LexGo Glass lawsuit.
If they pull it off, the partners stand to make millions in commissions.<eos> Unfortunately for them, the indigenous residents of the Northwest Passage, specifically the villagers of Maniitok, are loath to relinquish their ancestral lands... A fact which led to you being ordered to shoot a young Inuit in the head.<eos> Now, you can either let this butterfly-induced hurricane land entirely on you, or you can point us to whichever lawyer flapped his or her wings and blew you to Tendu's door.<eos> Well, sorry to sound like a broken record, but like I said, Raina's not great at being on time.<eos> Well, actually, Raina's not gonna be joining us today.<eos> We've been doing some digging, Ms. Lundquist.<eos> It turns out your work at the Animal Salvation Fund is completely pro Bono.<eos> Your day job is contract law at Mather and Kline.<eos> According to this, your current assignment is to secure port locations along the Northwest Passage for a company called Newhall Transocean.<eos> Now, if you manage to succeed, you're in line to make partner.
But Tendu Otolik's Sealfies turned public opinion against the ban.<eos> So, when you switched to Plan B and tried to buy the village outright, he stopped that, too.<eos> He sent money home in exchange for a promise from the village elders to never agree to Newhall's port.<eos> No way were you gonna make partner after that.<eos> Not unless you could make Tendu go away.<eos> Which brings us to your fixer, Kurt Godwyn.<eos> No, no, you see...<eos> Save it.<eos> We've already got a full confession from Mr. Godwyn.<eos> You might want to call your firm.

- He broke his phone, but insurance wouldn't reimburse him unless he reported it as stolen.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> How the hell did you solve this, Hitchcock?<eos> - Good old-fashioned detective work.<eos> - Yeah, they have no idea.<eos> They think the phone was actually stolen.<eos> - You're under arrest, jerk-o.<eos> - Don't even think about it.<eos> - He thought the bathroom was empty because we use the toilet with our feet up on the stall door.<eos> - Explain any further and I will kneecap you both.
The hearing is over, and here's where we stand vis-а-vis the precinct being shut down. The precinct will not be shut down.<eos> - Oh! - Yeah!<eos> - They decided to shut down the seven-four instead.<eos> - Wait, I don't understand.<eos> - Apparently the community came to our aid.<eos> There was a swell of online support orchestrated by an organization called "Gina-zone."<eos> - I think you mean Ginazon.<eos> I was behind the bar the whole time.<eos> Another great Gina Linetti entrance.<eos> - I told you, you can't be back here.
Besides, he's alive and well in 1916<eos> Mick's right.<eos> The mission hasn't changed.<eos> Except we can't destroy the Spear because we don't have the Blood of Christ.<eos> So we steal the spear and get it out of 1916.<eos> Now, you do realize that there's a big problem with that plan, Sarah.<eos> The other us's have the Spear.<eos> Oh, never stolen anything from myself before.<eos> Could be interesting.<eos> Ugh, need I remind you that we cannot interact with ourselves.
We're still in World War I.<eos> Gideon, get us out of here.<eos> Negative, Captains.<eos> The ship has sustained critical damage.<eos> Well, good news.<eos> The time-storm seems to have caused a temporary ceasefire.<eos> The bad news is the Legion of Doom's still trying to kill us.<eos> Wait, how far do you even think we'll be able<eos> - to make it out there?<eos> - You only have to make it as far as the other Waverider.
Hey, sorry, but we're closed.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Hey, listen, buddy.<eos> - I don't want any...<eos> - Look... I know you're not gonna believe me, but I have a job interview at First National Bank tomorrow.<eos> Congrats.<eos> The thing is...<eos> I don't have a suit.<eos> I was hoping to borrow a couple of hundred bucks to buy a new one.<eos> And what if I don't lend you the money?
Huh.<eos> - Stella?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Um, I need you.<eos> We're not done.<eos> - Hey. - Hey, what's up?<eos> Hey, Brett?<eos> Honey, what's going on?<eos> Maybe I could stand to be in better shape.<eos> Maybe you two could encourage me instead of gawking at me like a couple of bitches.
Of course.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> - Hey, do you guys want to come over for a movie marathon?<eos> We're gonna watch "The Sting,"<eos> uh, "Spanish Prisoner"...<eos> - Ooh, Thomas Crown.<eos> - "Thomas Crown Affair."<eos> I know you're making fun of me, I just don't know how.<eos> They're all con movies.<eos> Ah. You know, instead, maybe... you should read "The Giving Tree."
- There wasn't time.<eos> - There wasn't time?<eos> Or you just decided you could handle it better than me?<eos> Maybe you thought you should've got the bump for Deputy District Chief.<eos> Chief, you have every right to be upset, but I didn't intend to undercut your authority.<eos> I had a different vantage point.<eos> I saw something.<eos> I acted.<eos> Simple as that.<eos> You don't want to make an enemy out of me, Chief.
Running a line.<eos> We need more pressure.<eos> The ladder may have nicked an artery.<eos> His BP's dropping fast.<eos> All right, Cruz, Tony, stabilize the ladder.<eos> Capp, when you're ready, go for it.<eos> Whizzer saw would be faster.<eos> This is fine, thanks.<eos> Capp, when you're ready.<eos> I'm telling you get the whizzer.
Excuse me?<eos> Look, you want to take me on?<eos> Good.<eos> I will take this as far as you want to go, but right now, back off my scene.<eos> All right.<eos> He got in his buggy and drove off.<eos> Not another word.<eos> - Good for you, Chief.<eos> - Is it?<eos> He had no cause to come at you.
Are you shooting up?<eos> My dog is gone.<eos> You didn't pat him down? You didn't search him?<eos> - What are you, a rookie?<eos> - No, no, he comes up and I...<eos> Tell Commander Crowley I'll have an Exposure Report when I get back from Med.<eos> But get him inside, search him properly, and get his info.<eos> All right, come on.<eos> We just finished unpacking last night.<eos> Why do you want to know about Dan?
How can you not know?<eos> The condition of the body.<eos> That's him.<eos> He was wearing a blue shirt, grey sweater.<eos> He's tall. Like 6'3".<eos> No. No.<eos> No. Where's the body?<eos> - At the medical examiner's.<eos> - I'll go. I'll know if I look...<eos> You don't want to see the body, ma'am.
I can do both at the same time.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Dan Llewellyn stood up for a few gay teens a week and a half ago...<eos> Punched a grown bully who was threatening them.<eos> Harlan Betts.<eos> Betts left, but pissed.<eos> You and Erin.<eos> Hmm.<eos> The guy punched me, and I'm the one in hot water?<eos> Why don't you go arrest him?

Because somebody set his house on fire with him in it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Do you find that funny?<eos> Karma's a bitch, huh?<eos> Two people were killed in that blast, and one of them was a teenager from Reynolds, so what happened?<eos> Did he kiss another kid in front of you?<eos> You decided to teach him a lesson?<eos> Nope.<eos> I'm warning you: lose the grin, or I will lose it for you.<eos> You're gonna want to see this.
My husband's travelling there on business.<eos> Is... is that where this happened?<eos> The south side of Chicago.<eos> We believe the man's name was Bill Johns.<eos> He was wearing this watch and a wedding ring.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Why would a dead man in Chicago be wearing my husband's watch and ring?<eos> Curt and I talked on the phone last night.<eos> He calls every night when he's travelling.<eos> - He called you from New York?
Your brother, Rafael... has he been in trouble?<eos> Not since he moved here from Florida.<eos> Assault with a deadly weapon, self-admitted gang member.<eos> Rafi was here last night with my fiancé.<eos> - What's your fiancé's name?<eos> - Bill Johns.<eos> Perfect.<eos> How long have you been seeing Bill?<eos> Six months.<eos> He tell you what he did for a living?
It's your birthday.<eos> You don't think he could figure that out?<eos> Look.<eos> You found out Bill or Curt or whatever he called himself was married, you got angry.<eos> - Any woman would.<eos> - No!<eos> Okay, your brother found out, defended your honor.<eos> Okay, where's Rafael?<eos> Where is Rafael?<eos> Roxanne, you got to be a big sister right now.
I mean, just... maybe there's some justice in this world.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just...<eos> I keep thinking maybe if I wasn't so stupid...<eos> Just tell me what you know.<eos> Do you know that your husband had another name before he met you?<eos> Forrester.<eos> You're kidding me.<eos> You should start moving on.
Flynn's mother may be innocent, but she still raised a monster.<eos> And given your performances, this may be the only way to get this done.<eos> Forget it. We refuse.<eos> You cannot make us do this.<eos> This is not right. Maybe I haven't been clear.<eos> This operation has been green-lit at the highest levels.<eos> It's a go.<eos> You refuse, we will charge you with aiding and abetting a wanted terrorist.<eos> So, you can either spend the next few hours working for me, or the next 10 to 15 years wishing you had.<eos> That clear enough for you?
Treasury Department keeps a... poorly guarded file room there, Mr. Capone.<eos> That's your big gift?<eos> As if they're gonna get me for tax evasion.<eos> Get him out of here.<eos> I also have this letter from your accountant, Mr. Mattingly.<eos> He makes some fairly scandalous accusations.<eos> With this evidence, believe me, you'd be going to prison.<eos> Pay Mr. Mattingly a visit.<eos> Make sure he can't write any more letters.<eos> I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.
Keep it down, will you?<eos> My wife and kids don't know my real name.<eos> Nobody does.<eos> Did Al send you?<eos> We look like mobsters to you?<eos> You're from the bureau, then?<eos> Is that what this is?<eos> I work hard. I don't take bribes.<eos> Just because I was born a Capone, that doesn't mean I act like one.<eos> We know. You're a good man and an honorable cop, and that's why we came to you in the first place.
He's my little brother.<eos> I love the stupid son of a bitch.<eos> I wiped his damn nose, took him to buy candy on the corner.<eos> What makes you think that I want to be the one - to put him behind bars?<eos> - Mr. Hart...<eos> We're done here.<eos> And if you tell anyone who I am, you're gonna have more than one Capone to worry about.<eos> Did you know that he takes ads out in newspapers, looking for you?<eos> All over the country, for years.<eos> He misses you.

Good.<eos> But if you want speedier results going forward...<eos> Yes?<eos> I assume you know about the NSA Data Farm in Utah.<eos> I need access to their 12 exabytes of raw data, which I have a sneaking suspicion you can provide.<eos> And what will you do with it?<eos> My team has developed advanced mining software, more advanced than anything the NSA will produce in the next ten years.<eos> It gives us the ability to tap into cell phones, email accounts, satellites, traffic cams, that sort of thing.<eos> Now, not only will we be able to find Lucy, Rufus, Wyatt Logan,<eos> Garcia Flynn, and the Lifeboat, but if our test works, we'll have the capability to pinpoint anyone, anywhere, at any time you want.
Yeah.<eos> Get me to the Lifeboat. I'll take us home.<eos> Police are on the way.<eos> Ambulance too.<eos> I don't know if we can wait that long.<eos> He's lost a lot of blood.<eos> - Can you stand?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We're just gonna take him there ourselves.<eos> Thank you for your help. I know this was hard for you.
- Wow.<eos> - I didn't know if it was your thing.<eos> Baby, that's... - that's everybody's thing. - Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The cross-eyed hooligans at the Homecoming game are gonna love it.<eos> No, silly.<eos> No, this is a private show for you, before you have to go off on patrol...<eos> Nedley figures the streets are gonna be awash with booze and urine all weekend.<eos> So it's all hands on deck.<eos> You guys need to get some more hands, so that yours can stay right here.
Come on over!<eos> - Shut up.<eos> - Here he comes.<eos> - Why?<eos> - You remember Wynonna?<eos> - The girl everyone was scared of.<eos> - Even you?<eos> There were rumours, I guess 'cause your dad and sister...<eos> You had a breakdown.<eos> That didn't do it for you, huh?
I'm Wynonna Earp, Demon Detective.<eos> The Blue Devils were a joke.<eos> We'd had enough.<eos> Senior year, Old Coach Moore, he gave us a... spell.<eos> He was batshit crazy about losing all the time.<eos> So me, Skip, Cam and Bryce...<eos> - B-Train.<eos> - Wynonna.<eos> We didn't take it seriously, but... we hit the bong and said the words.<eos> Then, I shit you not, this thing appeared out of the trophy case.
What happens at the end of the book?<eos> Excuse me, but your tree is blocking the path.<eos> You should move it before somebody gets hurt.<eos> I'm afraid it's already too late.<eos> Magic. Are you a witch?<eos> She's a freak! Haven't you ever heard about the monster who lives in the shack...<eos> The freak with magic?<eos> That nest didn't fall out of the tree, did it?<eos> No. It made good target practice, though.<eos> And so will you.
We've known each other since we were kids.<eos> Am I hearing right, you got a solicitation for murder?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I need a promise from the PD first.<eos> My kid brother, Frankie, he owes some guys money who you don't want to owe money to.<eos> He went south to pick up a car for them.<eos> He got popped, with 100 pounds of weed in the trunk.<eos> 100 pounds?<eos> You said it was a little bit of weed.<eos> I'm offering you murder-for-hire.

Only thing that cures it is the kush.<eos> Omar, we have to ask you about that case.<eos> Ah, been there, done that.<eos> I spent two weeks down at 26th and Cal, ducking shanks and eating bologna sandwiches for something I didn't do.<eos> Daddy, who are they?<eos> Just some police officers, baby, making sure we all right around here.<eos> Go back and read your books.<eos> You know, only pimps still carry money clips.<eos> So any idea who might have killed Rebecca?<eos> I'm supposed to help you guys now?
Let's go have a look.<eos> Hey, Hank, I got to be honest. Something's not equating with me.<eos> What's that?<eos> Well, Donald Clark.<eos> Why don't we let him loose?<eos> He solicited a murder, Al.<eos> Not like we haven't done worse.<eos> You know, for our kids.<eos> Let's see how it plays out.<eos> C-can I help you guys?
- Hank?<eos> Hank?<eos> - Sarge.<eos> Sarge!<eos> This is Group Supervisor Greg Hammet from the ATF.<eos> You need to release him right now.<eos> You gotta be kidding me.<eos> This is our offender.<eos> He's not going anywhere.<eos> Well, he's an undercover federal agent, so it's best you uncuff him.
All right, get Omar Fry down here.<eos> Set up a fake hit that you can show Donald Clark.<eos> Get him on tape giving you the rest of the money.<eos> Listen, Hank, I think I got through to Clark.<eos> - I think he might back out of this thing.<eos> - Al.<eos> Set it up.<eos> Remember the Family Secrets sting?<eos> When I had to cover you in, what, two gallons of pigs blood over you because you were supposed to be stabbed to death?<eos> Hey, so did Detective Lindsay explain everything to you?
- I think he might back out of this thing.<eos> - Al.<eos> Set it up.<eos> Remember the Family Secrets sting?<eos> When I had to cover you in, what, two gallons of pigs blood over you because you were supposed to be stabbed to death?<eos> Hey, so did Detective Lindsay explain everything to you?<eos> Yeah, I'm supposed to get dolled up like I'm dead, and you're gonna take pictures.<eos> But I ain't agreed to nothing yet.<eos> Hey, it only takes 30 minutes.<eos> I give you an execution-style makeover, you lay down, close your eyes for a minute, and I take a few shots.
- "Was"?<eos> - Yeah, until about a year ago. Then he became inactive.<eos> He got a civilian job at Pioneer Machining.<eos> Guess where that's located.<eos> Ten miles north in Logan Square.<eos> Which is right across the street from Grainger, which is where Rebecca Clark worked as a clerk in Shipping and Receiving.<eos> Well, I mean, we know the Players and the 54th Street G's do have a pretty long history of gang warfare.<eos> How Rebecca Clark got involved, I have no idea, but this could be a retaliation hit, Sarge.<eos> Yeah, well, why don't you start by asking him?<eos> Hey, excuse me, we need to ask you some questions, Jeremy.
But you admit you did know her, right?<eos> We met on a lunch break.<eos> Where we worked, it's all industrial.<eos> Everyone goes to the same strip mall for lunch.<eos> So we went on a date that night, that's all.<eos> So you admit that you were with her that night.<eos> Your first date and she ends up killed.<eos> You see how you're the nexus, Jeremy?<eos> We have a gang card in there that says that you're connected to the 54th Street G's.<eos> You better update your records.
What can I get for you?<eos> Vodka tonic.<eos> And, uh, I've got his next one.<eos> Done.<eos> We had this case.<eos> Black kid, 14, was killed by this white store owner up in, uh, Rogers Park.<eos> They got into this argument over the price of milk, and it escalated.<eos> Store owner thought the kid was pulling a gun when the kid was going for his wallet, and he shot the kid dead.<eos> Claimed self-defense, and he walked, this morning.<eos> I came at you with a full head of steam.
...because smiling is attractive.<eos> Ok, smiling, you know, it draws people in.
She had a fall and broke her hip, that's all.<eos> Are we really going to stay here?<eos> I thought you never got along with her.<eos> Look, she's in trouble and she needs our help<eos> It's a good option, Chrissy!<eos> You mean it's the only option, dad.<eos> Hi, Jenny, I'm Philip.<eos> I'm your Liason Officer.<eos> It's good to finally meet you Nice to meet you.<eos> Can I get you anything?
It's a good option, Chrissy!<eos> You mean it's the only option, dad.<eos> Hi, Jenny, I'm Philip.<eos> I'm your Liason Officer.<eos> It's good to finally meet you Nice to meet you.<eos> Can I get you anything?<eos> No, I'm alright.<eos> Just before we start, I should say I haven't made up my mind yet.<eos> Ok.<eos> Shall I just talk you through how it works? You'll go in first and you'll read...
It's good to finally meet you Nice to meet you.<eos> Can I get you anything?<eos> No, I'm alright.<eos> Just before we start, I should say I haven't made up my mind yet.<eos> Ok.<eos> Shall I just talk you through how it works? You'll go in first and you'll read...<eos> Wait, he's going to be there, right?<eos> He's requested to there be, yeah.<eos> I can't, I can't be in the same room with him.<eos> Ah, well, you can petition that he isn't in the room, if you're going to find it too distressing but he can appeal.
No, just... I didn't want her to get into trouble.<eos> Oh, my God, it's you!<eos> This is gonna sound terrible!<eos> My daughter set fire to the science lab and I think your son tried to shoulder the blame.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> Well, thanks for apologizing.<eos> She just started a new school and this is how she introduces herself.<eos> She's been a bit of a handful since her mum died.<eos> Well, that must be really hard for both of you.
Do you want a blow by blow account of how my father died?<eos> Do you? Philip... He was a brave man.<eos> I'm sure that he was...<eos> No, no. I'm sorry.<eos> Thanks for the party.<eos> Sam, I got fish and chips!<eos> Sam!<eos> Sam?<eos> It's late.<eos> I know, I just came to read to you.
You want to find an ambulance chaser, follow the ambulances.<eos> Good work, Roger.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just hope y'all can keep up, you know?<eos> You probably heard about when Rob Kardashian's pool guy had that slip and fall?<eos> I handled that.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - $3,500.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So the only thing you have to remember is...
Leo!<eos> Ah! Help!<eos> I'm hit! I'm hit!<eos> I'm hit!<eos> Relax.<eos> It's just salsa.<eos> Here.<eos> Ugh! Good plan.<eos> Well, in our defense, it did work.<eos> Look, I will get the white board out and I will show you two...
So, I mean, it really turned out better than we drew it up.<eos> Except you didn't tell me the plan.<eos> Okay, well, Palmer, we didn't know you liked tacos.<eos> Well, that's because you turned down her dinner date.<eos> Murtaugh, that was uncalled for.<eos> But it was... it's a fair point.<eos> It's a fair point.<eos> - Agent Palmer?<eos> - Yes.<eos> We've given you access to both men in our custody.
For what?<eos> You'll see.<eos> Looks like I got everything.<eos> - Heading back to D.C.?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Where's Riggs?<eos> I-I haven't seen him.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh, well, please tell him that I said "so long."<eos> And thank you.
I just found out about this little gathering. - Jim.<eos> - My understanding is there's some question about my authority<eos> - as Deputy District Chief. - We're just...<eos> And unless I'm mistaken, that authority damn well gives me the power to reassign firefighters inside my district.<eos> Now, if the Fire Commissioner wants to change the way the CFD has done things for the last 150 years, I'm sure we'd all be happy to hear about that.<eos> Until then, I'd prefer it if we did not show favoritism to one particular battalion chief.<eos> I tried the end-around... but he was ready for it.<eos> Put headquarters in an untenable position.<eos> Where does that leave us?<eos> You're not gonna wanna hear it, but I believe these assignments... are permanent.
No, you... you can't let him win.<eos> - Well, he did.<eos> - No, Missy, listen.<eos> I did two years under Tipton, and I hated every last shift, but I made it through.<eos> The one thing I can say about working at 27 is it made me stronger, and now I'm at 51, and it's...<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Well... well, technically...<eos> They transferred you right back here.<eos> - Okay, but what Stella means is... - Look...<eos> Thank you, both, for trying.
Nice one, Otis!<eos> Come on!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Fire's out, Chief.<eos> Fire's out.<eos> Well, you heard Otis.<eos> Fire's out.<eos> Get to work.<eos> - Listen. - My God.<eos> I told you that this is gonna make you stronger.
Look, I don't know if you're aware of this, but I work in the mayor's office.<eos> Actually, I'm deputy mayor.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> That conference was for the Better Chicago project.<eos> Your firefighters rescued about 50 government leaders from all over Chicago.<eos> Your men and women were remarkable.<eos> Every one of 'em.<eos> Thank you.<eos> They'll take great pride in that.<eos> Chief, I'm here because I'd like to talk to the mayor about a commendation for you.
McCarthy thought that there were communists everywhere. State Department, writers, journalists.<eos> He's in the middle of his most famous hearings, looking for reds in the army.<eos> The guy's practically wearing a giant neon sign that says "Rittenhouse."<eos> Okay. Rufus, you stay here.<eos> Uh, hey, guys?<eos> Not to sound like my mom, but... is that what you're wearing?<eos> Listen.<eos> I'm a busy man.<eos> You know a communist spy in the military, you tell one of my aides.<eos> Well, I'll tell you what I told them:
I don't deserve this.<eos> Crooked press attacks me. People laughing at me.<eos> Enemies everywhere.<eos> I'm a patriot.<eos> Everyone's the hero of their own story.<eos> Like you. Going after Rittenhouse...<eos> you'll never win, son.<eos> Oh, we'll see about that.<eos> - I think we're done here.<eos> I promised you some information.
Jiya!<eos> So if you exist, that means Grandpa was, like, way deep in the closet.<eos> It's 1954. You'd be arrested for being gay.<eos> He's looking at me like I'm a piece of meat.<eos> Can't imagine what that's like.<eos> Excuse me. Are you Ethan?<eos> Ethan Cahill?<eos> - No. Sorry. You're mistaken.<eos> - No. We're not cops.<eos> I don't know what you think you saw here, but I have a wife and son to get back to, so...
I didn't believe it either at first, but he got me out of Mason Industries.<eos> Somewhere underneath all that smarm, there's an actual heart.<eos> Oh, that's lovely.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Lucy, you weren't kidding on the phone.<eos> Look at all this stuff.<eos> Everything that we could possibly need.<eos> But to sort it, to authenticate it with hard evidence... that could take years.<eos> Or hours, with my software.<eos> You give me the Rittenhouse names, I'll give you every phone call they've made, every email they've ever sent, every willy pic they've ever sexted.
Hey, Rufus, back in '54, um... I couldn't open my eyes, but I heard everything you said.<eos> What did I say?<eos> I've been waiting 60 years to tell you.<eos> I love you too.<eos> Jiya?<eos> Jiya?<eos> Jiya. Jiya!<eos> Jiya! Jiya!<eos> Where'd you go?<eos> Excuse me, gentlemen. You've been reassigned.
Previously on "Quantico"...<eos> The AIC is the hand of a much larger body.<eos> I'm forming a select team to fight it.<eos> A covert joint-task force.<eos> Roarke is the man in the government that we've been looking for.<eos> That's the Speaker of the House.<eos> Why'd you leave Russia?<eos> This isn't first-date material.<eos> We're just worried about you.<eos> Yeah, well, you should be worried about me getting killed.
Lydia didn't have a lot to say, huh?<eos> No.<eos> I'm the one who didn't have anything to say.<eos> I can't ask her what I really need to know.<eos> Was it my fault?<eos> Did I make her into this person?<eos> Did she just make a mistake?<eos> Is this who she really is?<eos> Anyway, you must be excited.<eos> You all get to go back to your lives.
No one will ever know.<eos> Stutz?<eos> Cardenas?<eos> Kreigsman?<eos> Mullen?<eos> Hassane?<eos> Who are we missing?<eos> Tell us.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't tell you about Abelard or Bowers or Charleton.
Stutz?<eos> Cardenas?<eos> Kreigsman?<eos> Mullen?<eos> Hassane?<eos> Who are we missing?<eos> Tell us.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't tell you about Abelard or Bowers or Charleton.<eos> I can't tell you about Dowery or Gomez.
Cardenas?<eos> Kreigsman?<eos> Mullen?<eos> Hassane?<eos> Who are we missing?<eos> Tell us.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't tell you about Abelard or Bowers or Charleton.<eos> I can't tell you about Dowery or Gomez.<eos> And I definitely can't tell you about Folte.
Who do you work for?<eos> You're gonna find out yourself the longer you keep me here.<eos> Did you kill León Velez?<eos> Frame Raina Amin?<eos> That was you in Central Park.<eos> You put Rebecca Sherman up to that?<eos> That's a "yes."<eos> You better stop asking questions and start answering them.<eos> No.<eos> You better get out of here.
You better get out of here.<eos> I messed up.<eos> They'll be coming for me.<eos> They?<eos> Who's they?<eos> How'd you mess up?<eos> The cops were supposed to find Amin's body in the mall.<eos> She got away.<eos> The people who hired me are gonna find me and kill me unless you let me grab my go-bag and we all get out of here.<eos> You let me go and I will tell you everything... who I work for, who's next on their list.
You'd use one?<eos> Well, I don't have a terrace, so I wouldn't know.<eos> One of the victims in this case is the daughter of one of your colleagues,<eos> - isn't that right?<eos> - Alvin Olinsky.<eos> His daughter Lexi was killed by the fire.<eos> And getting someone, anyone, convicted for what happened to Detective Olinsky's daughter would bring him some sort of closure, wouldn't it?<eos> - Objection.<eos> - Withdrawn.<eos> I show you what is marked Defense Exhibit 12.
- Objection.<eos> - Withdrawn.<eos> I show you what is marked Defense Exhibit 12.<eos> Do you recognize that?<eos> It's my arrest report.<eos> Would you read the highlighted part?<eos> "After advising suspect of his Miranda rights, he stated of his own free will,<eos> It was me, okay.<eos> I started the damn fire."<eos> It's curious, don't you think, that the People haven't entered that statement into evidence?
It was me, okay.<eos> I started the damn fire."<eos> It's curious, don't you think, that the People haven't entered that statement into evidence?<eos> - Objection!<eos> - I'm curious too, Mr. Stone.<eos> Overruled.<eos> Why haven't the People entered Mr. Oates' statement<eos> - into evidence, Detective?<eos> - You'd have to ask the People.<eos> Could it be that they didn't trust you?

Mainly 'cause I'm not gonna testify.<eos> You have a subpoena in your hand.<eos> And the First Amendment and the shield law at my back.<eos> I am a journalist, after all.<eos> I don't know what it is you do exactly, but I wouldn't call it journalism.<eos> Be that as it may, I'm not getting on the stand.<eos> We could have you arrested for contempt.<eos> Speaking of which, I was just thinking recently of a weekend you spent at the Huntington Hotel in Grand Beach.<eos> When was that, four years ago?<eos> Why are you doing this?
Please read the headline.<eos> "Kimball Factory:<eos> A Kiddie Sex Den."<eos> And the essence of the story is what?<eos> That people threw parties at the abandoned factory to lure underage teens to engage in sexual acts.<eos> They'd get them drunk and high?<eos> That's right.<eos> If someone read this, might they do something drastic about it?<eos> - I'm not gonna answer that.<eos> - Nor should you have to.
He was so excited, you know, like little boys get.<eos> When he got home... he was different.<eos> - You're lying.<eos> - Watch it, young man.<eos> I know what he did to you.<eos> From the time he was five until Frank died.<eos> She's lying!<eos> She knows nothing about me!<eos> Mr. Oates, one more outburst and I will have you removed.<eos> Did Dylan say anything about it to you?
I assume this isn't a coincidence.<eos> It's all a con.<eos> Well, at least somebody pays attention to what I write.<eos> "In the courtroom, reality is irrelevant.<eos> The appearance of reality is all that matters."<eos> I do have a way with words.<eos> That wasn't a mistake, you sending me that list of articles.<eos> Why would I do that intentionally?<eos> So I would introduce your defense for you.<eos> And you'd never have to put your client on the stand to be cross-examined.
Your Honor, my client was upset.<eos> He spoke.<eos> The jury heard him.<eos> That's testimony.<eos> He waived his rights against self-incrimination.<eos> - Your Honor...<eos> - Clever, Mr. Stone.<eos> Very clever.<eos> I'll probably be reversed on appeal, but I'm gonna let you cross-examine him, but only as to the matters that he testified to on direct.<eos> I assume you're gonna need time to prepare your client, Mr. Forest.

To hell with Tamra and her friends, right?<eos> That's right.<eos> They're all irrelevant to me.<eos> So it's no big deal that they're all dead?<eos> - Objection.<eos> - Withdrawn.<eos> I have nothing further, Your Honor.<eos> Why did he do it?<eos> I don't know either.<eos> Mr. Stone told you a hell of story about light bulbs and kitty litter, door wedges, brown cargo jackets, but, unless I missed it, he never quite told you why Dylan Oates started a fire at a party filled with people he didn't know.
But only one had the motive to cause such unutterable devastation.<eos> Was it Dylan Oates?<eos> Or did Mr. Stone merely pull a patsy out of a hat?<eos> A patsy who happened to have a brown cargo jacket?<eos> A patsy whose childhood was tormented by such unspeakable indignities he would risk going to prison rather than admit what really happened.<eos> Now if it was Dylan Oates who started that fire, surely Mr. Stone would have answered that one simple, crucial question.<eos> Why?<eos> Thirty-nine children dead.<eos> Mr. Forest is correct.<eos> I didn't tell you why Dylan Oates set that fire and killed these 39 innocents.
Baby, don't blame yourself.<eos> Steven knew how much you loved him.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Walter Hancock.<eos> President of the Coastal State booster club.<eos> I just wanted to swing by and say to you and to your mom that the entire Coastal State community was deeply saddened by your loss.<eos> Course, this kind of tragedy can be used to push us further down the road to success, which I firmly believe runs right through Coastal State.<eos> How touching.<eos> Thank you for your time, Mrs. Raines.<eos> If you need anything else, please give us a call.
A fraternity.<eos> Have you seen this guy around any?<eos> Sure.<eos> That's Carson Tate.<eos> He has all the best pills... parties.<eos> Pills.<eos> If it's Carson Tate, he's a rich kid; He sells Adderall<eos> - out of his fraternity house.<eos> - Keys, please?<eos> He said I could drive the golf cart if I helped you out.
I amaze myself.<eos> You couldn't change into a clean shirt at the office?<eos> Unlike you, Roger, I don't keep multiple change of clothes at the workplace.<eos> Like, I only have, like, you know, what...<eos> Three.<eos> I know.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> - Everybody knows.<eos> - We're good. Thank you.<eos> Smells like you need help.
There is no fish.<eos> And Mr. Hancock is not a suspect.<eos> Anchovy.<eos> Anchovy's a fish, is it not?<eos> Riggs, you need to leave.<eos> Hold on.<eos> I lost my tooth.<eos> I think it's in the salad.<eos> This is... this is weird.<eos> Why don't you visit with your friend
Someone sent a taste your way?<eos> Benny?<eos> Hancock?<eos> Those men were just looking out for Jesse's best interests.<eos> And so was Steven, and now he's dead!<eos> Steven was full of himself.<eos> Thinking he knew best what was right for Jesse and me.<eos> Did Steven know you were taking payouts?<eos> And he went to Benny?<eos> I think it's time that you left.

I doubt it.<eos> I met her on G-Harmony.<eos> That's a Web site for geologists to find love.<eos> That's a real thing?<eos> Their slogan is "We're all about dating and not the carbon-14 kind""<eos> Well, have a lovely evening.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You, too.<eos> If you think that's more fun than talking to Zachary Quinto through a stall door, you're crazy.<eos> You know, we could've come to you guys.

Who said you could use my first name?<eos> Bret, Bret, you're gonna be the toast of Las Vegas.<eos> It's the reason why you wanted to get in the casino business with Wayne Hastings in the first place.<eos> You're gonna get it right in the teeth on this one. You know that, right?<eos> Right in the teeth, great.<eos> That's where I fucking like it.<eos> I played fucking football.<eos> Come on.<eos> Manatee!<eos> It's been a tumultuous couple years for you down in Miami from the Bullyinggate to missing on free agents like Mike Wallace to even having one of your players' wives rip on your quarterback Ryan Tannehill.
She's right there in Oakland.<eos> I'll be there.<eos> Come on, Rico!<eos> Rico, you've got to explode off the ball.<eos> You should've been five yards downfield.<eos> That should've been your ball.<eos> Working them hard, Coach.<eos> Got the boys looking good.<eos> A lot of kinks, but we're getting there.<eos> So, Mr. Siefert asked me to come down to give you a sense of what he was thinking, you know, rosterwise.
Rumple, stop it.<eos> You're letting her get under your skin.<eos> She has Gideon's heart.<eos> I've already lost one son, Belle.<eos> I can't lose another.<eos> And you won't... not as long as his mother's drawing breath.<eos> He's so lucky to have you.<eos> But sometimes, I feel that... this is our family's fate...<eos> For parents and children always to be torn apart.<eos> Hey, guys, you might want to get in here.
How do we know that you are actually you?<eos> Because it's me.<eos> Wait. No.<eos> Hook's right.<eos> We should have a safe word or something.<eos> How do we know you're not the Black Fairy?<eos> Because I am.<eos> Right.<eos> Sorry I doubted you, love.<eos> That wand won't do you any good... Not without the Savior around.
No.<eos> Savior or not, I will not let my son die.<eos> And if I have to kill his own fairy godmother to protect him, then that's exactly what I'll do.<eos> "And you will know the great evil by the crescent it bears."<eos> Evil was not born this winter.<eos> It was made.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> Fiona... it's you.<eos> You are the great evil.<eos> You and your son are destined to destroy each other.
Is that...<eos> Hers, yes.<eos> The Black Fairy has been banished for good.<eos> You really did it.<eos> And the Blue Fairy?<eos> Safe...<eos> Back with her kind.<eos> All is as it was.<eos> Thank you, Gold.<eos> Looks like the wedding can appen tomorrow, thanks to you.
Safe...<eos> Back with her kind.<eos> All is as it was.<eos> Thank you, Gold.<eos> Looks like the wedding can appen tomorrow, thanks to you.<eos> You did good, Savior.<eos> Thank you, Father.<eos> Welcome home, son.<eos> I've missed you so much.<eos> Both of you.
OV!<eos> OV!<eos> OV!<eos> OV!<eos> OV! OV!<eos> OV!<eos> OV!<eos> OV...<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Let me tell you a story.
Real good. You remember Lenny Sick from the old neighborhood, right?<eos> Good to see you, Danny.<eos> Long time.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I hear you been sitting on my house all night.<eos> Why?<eos> This is your house?<eos> Oh, it's very nice.<eos> Come on.<eos> What do you want?
Quickly.<eos> We're here because your neighbors have expressed concern about what's going on in this house with you and your children.<eos> I told you we're fine.<eos> Okay, but we just wanted a chance to talk to you and your kids separately.<eos> This is not necessary.<eos> Ivano is the father of my children.<eos> He provides.<eos> It also looks like he beats you and threatens you to keep quiet about it.<eos> Nicky...<eos> How old are you?
Children to take care of?<eos> No, but...<eos> If the police take away my husband, who pays the rent?<eos> Who puts food on the table?<eos> Do you want us to end up in a shelter, like homeless people?<eos> Ma'am, there are other options.<eos> Mama, is everything all right?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Take your homework and go back to your room.<eos> I think you should go now.
She left this, her phone number.<eos> - In my home.<eos> - All right, calm down.<eos> I want you to give her a message from me.<eos> I'm not your personal delivery service!<eos> You tell her that if she comes by my house one more time, it will not be good for her or you.<eos> You're stepping up pretty close to the line, sir.<eos> No, you are coming too close to the line!<eos> This is harassment.<eos> I told you, I know my rights.
Because they routinely make split-second decisions under the most difficult circumstances.<eos> Don't you have a more personal reason for blocking the release of these disciplinary reports?<eos> I do not.<eos> You do not?<eos> Isn't it true that you yourself were disciplined more than once while you were a police officer in proceedings that were not public until now?<eos> Your Honor, we object.<eos> It is not clear what proceedings Mr. Guerrero is referring to.<eos> Your Honor, these records were given to my office by a complainant in the original action.<eos> It's a hearing.<eos> I'll allow you to ask about them... for now.
Still can't straighten it all the way.<eos> And it still hurts when it's about to rain.<eos> It was good of you to come to court.<eos> Didn't do it for you.<eos> Did it for me.<eos> To show I'm not the man I was.<eos> For what it's worth, you did the right thing.<eos> Will you accept my thanks?<eos> Just be careful of the elbow.<eos> How much did that cost you?
fundamentalists who take credit for it, and, finally, the power players who benefit from it the most.<eos> When these eight pillars come together, they create a perfect storm, which is what we saw on 9/11, in the Moscow theater siege, at Bataclan, and, last month, at the G20 Summit.<eos> Whatever this shadow group was planning by stealing those drives is still unknown.<eos> Luckily, only one country's got out... ours.<eos> We call this information "the cache."<eos> Four years' worth of intelligence about this country.<eos> Now, that cache was accessed two days ago.<eos> Someone downloaded security and maintenance patterns for domestic cargo flights.<eos> And at 4:00 a.m. this morning, an RNX cargo aircraft went down just outside of Annville, Kentucky.<eos> You need to figure out if these are connected, what it's a part of, and who's responsible.

That you were not a part of it.<eos> But since she needed your help during the G20 crisis, she's afraid to let you out of her sight now.<eos> That is why you're here.<eos> Not for any net gain you bring this group of far better operatives than you.<eos> You're here because you know too much, and you must be babysat till it's over.<eos> So, sit, baby, wait, and stay out of my way, okay?<eos> Welcome to the bunker.<eos> What you're working on is beyond codeword-classified.<eos> It doesn't exist.<eos> Here, two stories underground, you should have the privacy you need.
Well, I'm glad you're finding time to get a jump-start on your mother's State of the Union.<eos> You must be way ahead of the game.<eos> You said you were supplying me with a group of highly-trained professionals equipped to take down an unfathomable conspiracy.<eos> Instead, I'm a hall monitor in high school.<eos> It's day one.<eos> They're adults.<eos> Day one or day 100, they should be able to work together.<eos> They need more than a boss.<eos> They need a... drill sergeant.<eos> It came to my attention that you needed some help, so I called on an old friend to offer his expertise.
Not as surreal as having you as my partner.<eos> But I don't expect you'll be on the task force much longer.<eos> Sean Gregory's coming in hot.<eos> Put a pin in it.<eos> - Mr. Gregory.<eos> - Mr. Hall.<eos> Thank you for making the time.<eos> Ms. Parrish.<eos> Always wanted to meet the woman who saved New York.<eos> How do you like our little party?
He's right.<eos> This is just the first inning in a long game.<eos> We wait... until we have all the faces on that board.<eos> I'm sorry... about what I said before.<eos> I was speaking out of anger, and I don't want to do that again.<eos> I want to do as much good as I can to make up for all the bad my daughter did.<eos> If you'll have me.<eos> The game begins again tomorrow.<eos> Get some sleep.<eos> You'll need it.

Sure.<eos> Let me just get my coat.<eos> Hello?<eos> Good evening.<eos> Mr. Haas.<eos> Catch up, okay?<eos> My fiancée says I'm too tough on you.<eos> Maxine Griffin.<eos> Founder of The Roster, a networking and visibility platform for professional women committed to helping each other rise.<eos> My father tell you that, too?
You talked to Keyes. That's what you did.<eos> Why would you trust someone on the inside?<eos> He's in on it.<eos> Leon, um... have you talked to someone?<eos> Like a shrink?<eos> I'm not crazy, Alex.<eos> No one is saying that you are, okay?<eos> Just maybe what happened to us stayed with you.<eos> And we're just worried about you.<eos> Yeah, well, you should be worried about me getting killed.
The best defense is a good offense.<eos> Only there is no defense for what I could do to you.<eos> Getting that idea into that big brain of yours, that's why you're here.<eos> Is that true, gentlemen?<eos> You've given your man carte Blanche to...<eos> See?<eos> Nobody's watching.<eos> Nobody's listening either.<eos> You can trust me on that because if they were,<eos> I probably wouldn't admit to you that you're exactly right about what I've done.
Nobody's listening either.<eos> You can trust me on that because if they were,<eos> I probably wouldn't admit to you that you're exactly right about what I've done.<eos> But as I was saying, I didn't bring you here to kill you.<eos> Well, I'd really like to get going, so do you think you could hasten to deliver your message?<eos> Your investigation into the Kotite murders, it's got to stop.<eos> You're meddling in matters of national security.<eos> You'll have to be a little more specific.<eos> At least four people have been murdered, and I'm not one for vague assurances from the intelligence community.<eos> Hmm. Well, you'll make an exception this time.
I've reached out to some friends at Scotland Yard, asked them to dig up records of what was going on in and around the court at the time of Kotite's trial.<eos> In the meantime, I suggest we approach one of the two local parties which might be able to shed some light.<eos> I'm guessing Cy Durning's widow is one of them.<eos> Who's the other?<eos> Farrell Putnam, the so-called "Death Star" law firm which Kotite hired to defend him.<eos> They've got offices all over the world, including here in New York.<eos> So, while I pop in on them, you and Kitty go and visit the widow Durning.<eos> This is her address.<eos> Why don't you take Kitty?<eos> I know you two have a lot to catch up on.
No.<eos> No, you look angry.<eos> Mr. Holmes?<eos> Mr. Garber will see you now.<eos> So, if I'm following you, you think four people connected to Eli Kotite's trial in London, including Mr. Kotite himself, have been murdered by a government agency?<eos> Well, when you put it like that, it does sound quite mad.<eos> Is there any other way to put it?<eos> No, there isn't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> There's no way I can give you the files you're looking for.
That didn't come up in any of our research.<eos> Well, of course it didn't.<eos> It was a best kept secret at the firm.<eos> When he was on his meds, he was one of the finest legal minds on the planet.<eos> When he was off them... well, let's just say he was prone to outbursts.<eos> What kind of outbursts?<eos> Ranting, raving.<eos> "The Russians are talking to me through my television."<eos> That sort of thing.<eos> I'm telling you, when he wasn't taking care of himself, he was capable of anything.
If Watkins is handling that brief, it's gonna need a rewrite.<eos> Make sure you're looking over his shoulder.<eos> Uh, thanks, Jonathan.<eos> I'll call after lunch if I need anything else.<eos> This is a surprise, Ms. Winter.<eos> Who's your friend?<eos> Joan Watson.<eos> She's here to make sure I don't beat you too soundly if you lie to me again.<eos> You sound confused.<eos> I'd be happy to set you straight, but I don't have any openings in my schedule today, ladies.
- What?<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm guessing you played soccer?<eos> I think you mean "football."<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Yes, because Miss Winter's foot devastated your testicles.<eos> Very funny, yes.<eos> Now, we could either continue with the double entendres, or you could tell us your role in Anson Gephardt's plot.<eos> Well, I told these two, I'll tell you everything.
So I asked Tom for advice.<eos> Obviously, that was a mistake, because the very next time he went off his meds...<eos> He blabbed about the whole thing to a roomful of people.<eos> And I told Gephardt.<eos> He told me not to worry about it, the bomb thing might never happen.<eos> "It's a fluid situation," he said. "Years are gonna pass""<eos> Obviously, they liked their original plan, because a bomb went off two days ago.<eos> Couple of hours later, I got an e-mail from Alberto.<eos> A big one.<eos> He sent you the files.
I don't expect a parade, but I did my country a service.<eos> I showed them the truth.<eos> You sold them a hoax.<eos> The Iran tape is a forgery.<eos> Now, who's gonna believe that?<eos> Walk it back.<eos> Spare a needless war.<eos> Might even save your own life.<eos> Just give him a minute!<eos> Hey, hey, you're not authorized to be here.
Seeing which gives out first, pacemaker, heart.<eos> Hey, look, Gideon, ask me whatever you want.<eos> - I'm an open book.<eos> - Mr. Delgado is the cartel's highest-ranking friend in L.A.<eos> Be a shame to waste him if we didn't have to.<eos> - Who else knows about him?<eos> - No one.<eos> - Nobody.<eos> - Just he and I.<eos> No, no, no, I believe you, I do.
[girl coughing] Lexi!<eos> We got her.<eos> We got her. Let us work.<eos> We got her. We got her.<eos> - Let us do our job, okay?<eos> - Lexi, baby.<eos> Watch out. Watch out.<eos> Take the front seat, Al.<eos> I'm bringing down extra staff from upstairs.<eos> How many nurses do you need?
Can I go in and see her?<eos> - Of course. - Okay.<eos> Baby...<eos> Sweet girl...<eos> Hey, sweet girl.<eos> Sweet girl.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Chief.<eos> - Sergeant.<eos> I understand the only reason Lexi Olinsky is alive is because of you.
66, can we release the scene to OFI yet?<eos> Affirmative.<eos> We're done in here.<eos> Scene's all yours.<eos> - You want to join us?<eos> - Please.<eos> Thank you, Lieutenant.<eos> I saw it on the news.<eos> It must have been really rough.<eos> Well, you guys should eat something.
Yeah, it was.<eos> Is there anything I can get for you, Chief?<eos> No. I'm good.<eos> You can send in Lieutenant Casey now.<eos> Thank you, Marcie.<eos> - He'll see you now.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Hey. - Hey.<eos> Heading out.<eos> Just wanted to check in, see if you needed anything.
- Okay, it's okay.<eos> Can I see her?<eos> I need to see her.<eos> - Hey, hey. - I need to see her.<eos> This is Meredith, Lexi's mom.<eos> This is Dr. Halstead, Jay's brother.<eos> So Lexi has burns over 60% of her body.<eos> Ohh, what?<eos> We had to make incisions in the burned area of Lexi's chest to improve her ability to breathe.<eos> I'll continue to update you every step of the way.
Detectives and arson investigators from across the city will not rest until the individual or individuals responsible are brought to justice.<eos> This cowardly act has robbed many of our Chicago citizens of their future.<eos> I'm being told that the structure was a home to many young and talented artists.<eos> If those responsible are watching this, they're about to feel the full strength and scope of the Chicago Police Department.<eos> Any questions?<eos> - Stone. - Hey.<eos> Antonio.<eos> The entire State's Attorney's office and investigators are at your disposal.<eos> - Good.<eos> - What do you need?
- Okay, it's okay.<eos> Can I see her?<eos> I need to see her.<eos> - Hey, hey. - I need to see her.<eos> This is Meredith, Lexi's mom.<eos> This is Dr. Halstead, Jay's brother.<eos> So Lexi has burns over 60% of her body.<eos> Ohh, what?<eos> We had to make incisions in the burned area of Lexi's chest to improve her ability to breathe.<eos> I'll continue to update you every step of the way.

So I opened the car door but, uh, she just shook her head.<eos> She was crying.<eos> You know, she couldn't leave him.<eos> "He needs me, Dad."<eos> This is a nightmare.<eos> Yeah, for a lot of people.<eos> Barry was just trying to help.<eos> They were artists and musicians who couldn't afford regular rent.<eos> You know, they made a community there.<eos> Do either of these men look familiar to you?
When he killed himself at the firehouse, he had an unregistered gun.<eos> Why would he be walking around with that?<eos> He was being threatened.<eos> - By who?<eos> - He didn't say, but he started to get really paranoid.<eos> Threatened about what?<eos> Money.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Like I said, Barry kept me out of all of that stuff.<eos> Okay, Stacia, I'm gonna ask you something and I'm only gonna ask once.
- Really?<eos> Any chance you have security cameras?<eos> What am I?<eos> Fort Knox?<eos> No, I don't have any damn security cameras.<eos> But I got eyeballs.<eos> And that guy had been by here three times to talk to Barry.<eos> He was bringing nothing but bad news.<eos> Next thing you know, 39 young people get called home way before their time.<eos> I'll go get you that license plate number.
So, before you say no...<eos> Job offer.<eos> There's nothing written here.<eos> Because the offer...<eos> is whatever you want it to be.<eos> Name it.<eos> Salary, benefits, take whatever time off you need, set your own schedule.<eos> You're worth it.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> Can I give you the best piece of advice my dad ever gave me?
Step away from the desk, Detective.<eos> My bad.<eos> You know what?<eos> I did come with someone.<eos> Detective, you're<eos> - trespassing.<eos> - Oh, no, no, no.<eos> See, your colleague... she fell off the map today, so I'm doing my job, and yours.<eos> Look, Agent Palmer took a vacation day.<eos> If she's not calling you back, maybe it's because she doesn't want to.
I see why you two get along.<eos> Palmer?<eos> It's not her place.<eos> It's a safe house.<eos> _<eos> Rog.<eos> Palmer was here.<eos> Rog.<eos> ...I am trying to, Detective, so back off.<eos> The time to help is when I came to you this morning, and told you Palmer was missing.
You know, he's come a long way.<eos> I heard he had a little help from Palmer.<eos> I mean, that's what I hear, you know?<eos> Just... just Palmer?<eos> Well, I mean, who else?<eos> I was suspended, so, therefore, I didn't have a weapon, and I mean, where would I find a gun?<eos> Yeah, I'm not-not buying that at all.<eos> Really.<eos> Um, but I will accept it, because Gideon is in custody, and our leak is plugged.<eos> Now, the city attorney would like to have a word with you, so I will give you the office.
I want to call a truce.<eos> Get here before 3:00.<eos> I'll be there.<eos> Anything?<eos> You will never guess who wants some face-time with you this afternoon.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> Well, first we convince the special agent in charge that we're here to help.<eos> I don't think that's gonna be possible.<eos> Welcome to Cleveland.<eos> If I were to debrief you, I would tell you that we are following multiple threats, none of which are credible enough to close off the public space surrounding the courthouse, which is where people are gonna come to protest.
The blocked calls are from my daughter.<eos> I promised my wife I wouldn't help her if she relapsed again, but she's my baby.<eos> What can I do?<eos> So, she calls asking for money.<eos> I know I should say no, but her calls are the only way I know she's even still alive.<eos> I know I'm not supposed to talk about the trial, but how am I supposed to find this man guilty and take him away from his kids when I know how that feels?<eos> Mitch Connor, juror number four.<eos> Just sold his house for twice market value through a shell corp.<eos> Clever way to disguise a bribe.<eos> I told you...
Exactly the verdict the Collaborators want.<eos> So, you know what you need to do now.<eos> Get to that judge, ASAP.<eos> On it.<eos> What are you three doing up here?<eos> There's still phones ringing downstairs.<eos> You need to follow up on a threat made to Judge Kaplan.<eos> Just like you followed up on the threats to the jurors?<eos> I've got multiple complaints of harassment.<eos> I'm not about to let you tamper with that judge.
You would obstruct justice again.<eos> You recently received a lump-sum payment from a blind trust.<eos> You're accusing me of something?<eos> A bribe to force a verdict?<eos> That money has a clean paper trail, and I'm not forcing anything other than an end to a long deliberation.<eos> An Allen Charge is a standard procedure.<eos> An Allen Charge is a way to force the jury to decide quickly.<eos> You're being controlled, Judge.<eos> I've seen that look.<eos> You've taken the leap, and now you're just hoping that you get away with your decision.
Trying to find out who Carly was working for before she died.<eos> All right, so that's why you broke in, to see if we're on the same side?<eos> I had to be sure before I approached you, so I started following you.<eos> But I needed real proof.<eos> After reading your e-mails, now I know.<eos> Rebecca Sherman, Alice Winter, Thomas Roth,<eos> Peter Theo, Maxwell Fletcher, and Warren Shepherd.<eos> Peter...<eos> Theo.<eos> I gave you something valuable.
- Mr. Speaker.<eos> You don't mind if I introduce you?<eos> Um, I'd be honored.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Presidents usually start these speeches with "My fellow Americans," because we like to remind you that we are all in this together, equals.<eos> We also say, "My fellow Americans,"<eos> so that you'll forget for a second everything in our country that divides us.<eos> We tell you that we believe in a United States that will protect your family, and then we throw a man in jail for protecting his.

This doesn't feel right.<eos> He's one of the architects for Jane's tattoos.<eos> So letting him follow one might trigger something big.<eos> Well, then maybe I should be the one to go with him.<eos> No.<eos> The whole point is to put Roman into new situations, all right?<eos> Take him out of his comfort zone.<eos> Patterson, keep working on that clue.<eos> Soon as Reade gets in, bring him up to speed, partner up and try to track it down.<eos> I'll keep you posted once I get a time and a place - for the meet with my source. - Okay.
We're looking into a courier service.<eos> I know the best one.<eos> Speedy Ace, same day in Manhattan.<eos> Place your order with me by noon, get it wrapped and ready by the end of the day.<eos> Have you ever worked with a courier by the name of Lelantos?<eos> Doesn't ring a bell.<eos> I mainly deal with Ethan or Ed.<eos> How about this symbol, hmm?<eos> - Have you ever seen it before?<eos> - Wish I could help you.

Hurry!<eos> Uh, ladies, I'm so sorry, but I gotta close up early.<eos> We'll be quick.<eos> We're looking for a rare coin.<eos> Any kind in particular?<eos> Continental coins.<eos> Not a lot of people come looking for those.<eos> Well, my dad's a collector and his birthday's coming up.<eos> All right, but I really only have a couple minutes.<eos> I'll show you what I have in storage.
- It's way out of town.<eos> - We got this.<eos> I'll be back as soon as I can, okay?<eos> Keep me in the loop.<eos> There were three clues from my tattoo, and one pointed directly at Marc Gelman.<eos> He's gotta know more than he's letting on.<eos> He could help us find Weller and Roman.<eos> Organ trafficking ring?<eos> We have a money trail a mile long to prove it.<eos> I don't know what to tell you.
All right, problem solved.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Not entirely, the fight over who's going to drive is still...<eos> Oh, my God, stop talking!<eos> The place looks great.<eos> Did you guys get a maid?<eos> Kind of.<eos> WOLOWITZ: Dinner's almost ready.<eos> If you like meatloaf, I'm sure you'll like its cousin, bowl of meat.
Sort of.<eos> Kind of like your phone, or any device that's voice-activated by saying "Siri" or "Alexa."<eos> They're all listening all the time, because they need to hear when we need them, but they don't start paying attention until we do.<eos> It kind of works the same way here, where instead of "Siri," the signal is gunfire, and by "paying attention," it means saving the audio.<eos> The data that Cosmo's referring to goes into a buffer.<eos> So if there are no incidents, then it just gets deleted without anyone ever hearing it.<eos> And this is all done under the strict oversight of the city.<eos> Well, that's okay, then, 'cause governments never abuse the surveillance of their citizenry, do they?<eos> I would like copies of your data, all of it, for my own analysis.<eos> Whatever you need.
So, can I put you both down as "still wanting to catch the killer"?<eos> Because we're taking a vote.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Please.<eos> Thanks to BulletPoint's audio, we know that the shooter was in the employ of the last person to possess the guitar.<eos> Now, whoever he is, he never publicized having it.<eos> He might have derived his pleasure from it privately, but people like that, they rarely keep their prizes completely secret.<eos> So if we can identify him, obviously, we'll then have Azoff's shooter.<eos> Okay, so.<eos> We'll let you know - if anything shakes out.
Your boss, Councilman Slessinger.<eos> - Do you mind giving him a message?<eos> - Okay. He's been making the cops his punching bag in a lot of his speeches.<eos> Now, we're smart, we get politics.<eos> But there's got to be a way for him to stump about cutting crime without making it sound like we can't do our jobs.<eos> Captain, it's campaign talk.<eos> I know.<eos> But I'd still like you to remind him: if he wins, he's gonna have to work with us.<eos> I'd like that to go well.<eos> Wouldn't you?
Name of the victim was Jameel Clark.<eos> Mid-level SBK guy.<eos> And this was before Shinwell got put away, so it's a good chance they knew each other.<eos> Have you shared any of this with him?<eos> No. And I'm not gonna.<eos> A gun used to kill one banger 12 years ago surfaces now, and is used to shoot at another?<eos> That sounds personal.<eos> And you don't want to risk him taking matters into his own hands until we've, uh, got a better sense of what we're dealing with.<eos> That's right.<eos> I'll keep digging, and if, um, anything comes up, I'll let you know.

I didn't hear a thing.<eos> What?<eos> Well, I'm familiar with those projects where you and your family lived.<eos> Those apartments are too small not to hear anything.<eos> I think you're withholding something from me.<eos> Something to keep you from finding the person that killed my brother?<eos> You tell me.<eos> Yeah, go to hell.<eos> Look, if the killer strikes again, do you want Shinwell's death on your conscience?<eos> Say I did know something, why would I tell you?
Yeah, go to hell.<eos> Look, if the killer strikes again, do you want Shinwell's death on your conscience?<eos> Say I did know something, why would I tell you?<eos> I've seen what happened to people that talk, and I got my sister and my moms to think about.<eos> Yeah, Shin was Jameel's friend.<eos> But he's a banger.<eos> He chose that life, I didn't.<eos> I got to get to class.<eos> Hello?<eos> What do you guys want from me?
I've seen what happened to people that talk, and I got my sister and my moms to think about.<eos> Yeah, Shin was Jameel's friend.<eos> But he's a banger.<eos> He chose that life, I didn't.<eos> I got to get to class.<eos> Hello?<eos> What do you guys want from me?<eos> And what makes you think I had the Lady Frances?<eos> You lent it to Joshua Chris when you were courting him to sign with you.<eos> Oh. Where did you get that cock-and-bull story from?
Such as?<eos> We know you had an accomplice, we'll want his name.<eos> We'll also want to know what you did with Azoff's body.<eos> This obviously isn't your first professional work, Mr. Vennek.<eos> Would I be right in thinking that your incarceration might worry some of your previous employers?<eos> So now would be a very good time to think about avoiding general population.<eos> My helper's name was D'Agostino.<eos> Mr. Azoff... is at the bottom of Jamaica Bay.<eos> I bleached down his truck and had it dismantled at a chop shop.<eos> I'll give you their address, too.
Killer was smart enough to clean up, but they missed this bit.<eos> That's blood.<eos> You don't think the guitar was the murder weapon?<eos> I do.<eos> Short of being set afire on stage, he's died the most rock-and-roll death imaginable.<eos> But if the killer destroyed the Lady Frances by killing Cosmo with her...<eos> Then he obviously didn't kill him for it.<eos> Then why?<eos> Oh, don't bother setting up, I'm not gonna stay.<eos> I need to ask you a couple of questions.
Oh, don't bother setting up, I'm not gonna stay.<eos> I need to ask you a couple of questions.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You and the doc didn't let the drive-by go like I asked.<eos> We did not.<eos> And?<eos> Well, ballistics matched the weapon to the same one used to kill a friend of yours 12 years ago.<eos> Jameel Clark.<eos> What?<eos> Detective Guzman, he didn't want to tell you.
Please. You're helping me out by keeping me in the loop.<eos> This is Detective Marcus Bell, our consultant, Joan Watson.<eos> They've been working the Azoff case from the start.<eos> Is that it?<eos> The famous guitar I've been hearing so much about?<eos> No, but it is a '57 Desperado, same model and year.<eos> But you already knew that wasn't the Lady Frances because you destroyed it when you used it to kill Cosmo Dellis.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Is this a joke?<eos> Captain, I get you're sore about me throwing haymakers at the department, but...
You couldn't let Cosmo live to enter police custody because he could give you up as leverage in a deal.<eos> So, you went to his place.<eos> You got rid of him and the Lady Frances at the same time.<eos> Well, I hope this little fiction of yours keeps you warm when I'm mayor and you're all out on your asses.<eos> Do you mind showing us your hands, Councilman?<eos> What?<eos> Cosmo's wasn't the only blood we found at the scene.<eos> We figured, someone beats a guy to death with an electric guitar, they're gonna cut their hands.<eos> Councilman Slessinger, this is a warrant for your DNA.<eos> I told you I got nothing to say to you.
No.<eos> I picked up my book, like I said.<eos> But I didn't speak to him, he was asleep.<eos> W-was he making any noises?<eos> Nope.<eos> He was quiet as a mouse.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Sam? Sam?<eos> Yes, I told you, he was asleep.<eos> I'm sorry Kathy, but you need to come with us.
Until I met James, I didn't know what it felt like to be loved.<eos> He helped me to escape Peter.<eos> James was kind and gentle and loving.<eos> He was a father to Sam.<eos> We were a family.<eos> And Peter couldn't bear to see how happy we were.<eos> Sam. What are you doing here?<eos> Mum's at work.<eos> She's going to find you when she finishes.<eos> She wanted me to give you these.
What are you talking about?<eos> I thought you said he was asleep.<eos> He grabbed hold of my arm.<eos> It was like this.<eos> He was just digging his fingernails into me.<eos> Are you feeling all right, Cathy?<eos> That's strong.<eos> Nice.<eos> Now,<eos> I'm going to go and run you a nice hot bath.
Oh, damn.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm Jenny, I'm Sam's mum.<eos> Right.<eos> I wondered if I could speak to Oscar?<eos> I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> I just wanted to find out what happened.<eos> Haven't you asked Sam?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - My wife told you the rest,
Was that it?<eos> Did something else happen?<eos> No.<eos> It's OK.<eos> No, he...<eos> I fell, that's all.<eos> - You don't have to lie for Sam.<eos> - I told you I didn't<eos> - want to talk about it. - Oscar, wait.<eos> I think you should leave now.
I'll get a dustpan and brush.<eos> Butterfingers.<eos> Typical.<eos> I'm glad you're home, Gran.<eos> Me too.<eos> Philip Dawes, Philip Dawes...<eos> Excuse me, can I help you?<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm looking for Philip Dawes.<eos> Do you have an appointment?
That's what I mean when I say he abandoned you.<eos> You hadn't thought of it that way?<eos> Can I have a word with your mum?<eos> Go and wait in the car, Sam.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> OK, there are traits that concern me.<eos> Right, go on.<eos> It's only an initial assessment, but Sam's idolization of his father worries me.<eos> He shows no empathy for the victims, for James, for you.
- Enjoying yourself?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You know you're doing your mum's head in?<eos> - Yeah, well, it swings both ways.<eos> - No, she's your mum.<eos> Now, look, I know you've got a lot of tough things going on right now but you've got a choice here.<eos> You're a smart lad, you've got a lot of things going for you.<eos> Is this the standard speech to delinquents?<eos> - I'm just talking to you, Sam.<eos> - Yeah, because you fancy my mum.
Go on.<eos> Go.<eos> Just fuck off! Fuck off!<eos> So, he gave his girlfriend a necklace like thousands you could buy on the High Street.<eos> But it's Cathy Gillander's, I know that it is.<eos> Your daughter's probably just out with her friends.<eos> She hasn't got any friends except for Sam Woodford.<eos> Do you think I want this to be true? This is my son and I love him, but he killed her, I know that he did.<eos> Chrissy's life is in danger and you have to believe me!<eos> Officer, there's something you should see here.
Anyway, I'm sorry for everything.<eos> Oh, and FYI-- if you cry while they're fighting, they'll take you to McDonald's.<eos> Hello, Leonard.<eos> Why are you saying we have marital problems?<eos> We don't have marital problems!<eos> I see.<eos> You must be yelling at me out of wedded bliss.<eos> Look, just because we took our friend in does not mean that Penny and I are afraid to be alone.<eos> Yeah, this is a special circumstance.<eos> Sheldon mentioned you tried to get your brother to live with you, as well.
That's just where we have dinner.<eos> Now, I'm sure many of you are wondering how fun with flags began.<eos> So let's hear from some people who were there at the very start.<eos> H-Howard. Flashback sounds.<eos> Could have played that on my harp.<eos> Just roll the clip.<eos> Sheldon: So tell us in your own words about that magical moment when fun with flags was born.<eos> I honestly don't remember.<eos> Sheldon: Sure you do.<eos> I was telling you both the story about how Haiti and lichtenstein discovered they had the same flag.
I made a huge mistake.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Okay?<eos> Look, Bert, when I had money, I dated lots of girls who weren't right for me.<eos> And then I gave up my money, and now I'm alone and living with my friends, and somebody else should probably talk now.<eos> Look, sweetie, relationships aren't about money, okay?<eos> It's about respect and having things in common and...<eos> Yes, Sheldon?<eos> You and Leonard don't have anything in common.<eos> Maybe you should break up.
Halley. Look at mommy.<eos> Over here, honey.<eos> Say good-bye to mommy!<eos> Look at me!<eos> Look at your mother!<eos> All right, we can go.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.<eos> And I'm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.<eos> Based on the glowing reception of our recent behind theflagsretrospective, we thought you might like to see how it all came together.
- See ya, mate.<eos> - See ya, buddy.<eos> Bisson Health?<eos> Bisson Health is ready to buy up all the under-performing private hospitals before the Managed Care Bill goes through the Senate.<eos> Good.<eos> We have our politician who's ready to cross the floor with the managed care bill because he wants to retire comfortably.<eos> Which I don't need to know about and never will.<eos> Now, what we don't have is a strong blue-chip investor who's going to lead the charge into the hospitals.<eos> Yes.<eos> You need a whale in the bay.
- Bullshit.<eos> - Messages.<eos> Mrs Jeffries, please call her.<eos> Your son's school, the excursion is late, so pick up at 4:15.<eos> - What time's the partners' meeting?<eos> - Four.<eos> - Right. - Oh.<eos> Maybe you could pick him up, eh?<eos> No, that is not my job.<eos> Do you want some sleeves for those?

Okay, I received a message from the school that the bus was running late and to pick up Sam at 4:15, and that came from here.<eos> Could Sam have gone home?<eos> Is there some way you can check?<eos> He's seven years old, he doesn't go home by himself.<eos> He wouldn't even know where he lives.<eos> Kathleen, hi, it's me.<eos> Yeah, hi, is...<eos> Is Sam with you?<eos> No, no, no, it's fine.<eos> Um, I'll drop him home to you.
Details have emerged that the man in custody for the alleged kidnapping of a Brighton schoolboy was in a relationship with the boy's mother for three years while they attended university.<eos> It's unknown whether Mr Heywood and the boy's mother had been in contact in recent times.<eos> Reports have surfaced that a woman was also involved in the alleged abduction.<eos> She was seen leaving St Kilda Police Station in the early hours of Saturday morning.<eos> Well, as I say, I'm not in a position to discuss an ongoing investigation.<eos> The most important thing is that the little boy is home, he's safe...<eos> You have six new voice messages.<eos> Message received at 7:33pm.<eos> Mr Marin, this is Detective Staszic.<eos> I've got a few more questions I need to ask you...
If you'd like to make a booking, leave a message, and I'll get back to you.<eos> Hello, Joe Marin.<eos> Hello, Mr Marin.<eos> I'm Daphne Bryce, Mr Sheere's secretary.<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> Thanks for getting back to me.<eos> No trouble.<eos> I hope this isn't a bad time.<eos> I wasn't sure if you'd be at work today after the events of last week.<eos> Mr Sheere asked me to pass on his best wishes to you and your family.
- So just call her.<eos> Yep.<eos> You're a hard man to get a hold of.<eos> Yeah, sorry, work at the moment.<eos> Everyone's busy.<eos> So, couple of things to go over with you.<eos> Yep.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> The woman who was with Simon Heywood on the night of Sam's disappearance was Angela Erbakan.<eos> You know that name?
Cassandra:<eos> So, this is where Varian lives.<eos> It seems cozy, in a I-wish-I-had-said-goodbye- to-my-loved-ones- before-I-left kind of way.<eos> Cassandra:<eos> Just watch your step, Raps.<eos> Come on, this way.<eos> It's just fog. I'm sure it's okay.<eos> Fine. A booby trap!<eos> Raps, everything's gonna be... oh!<eos> What do you want?
- Shut the doors.<eos> 81 to Main, we're stationed at quarters, hearing gunshots a block or two south of here.<eos> Copy that, 81.<eos> We'll notify [indistinct].<eos> Casey!<eos> Open the door!<eos> - Go get Boden! - Yeah!<eos> You move, I'll drop you where you stand!<eos> Hand that over.<eos> What else do you need?
She don't need to know all that!<eos> - My bad...<eos> - "My bad" nothing!<eos> You better look sharp, brown-haired boy.<eos> Don't let them play you.<eos> Firemen, cops, all on the same team, only one carry ax, one carry a gun!<eos> Move yo' ass.<eos> [dramatic music] This is the Chicago Police!<eos> You need to answer our call so we can hear your demands!<eos> [phone ringing] [phone ringing] You have to pick up.
What do you mean?<eos> What do you mean who's the g...<eos> No, no, No, no, I'm faking it.<eos> I just... my heart is fine.<eos> I just needed to get out of there.<eos> Commander!<eos> Holy hell, Herrmann.<eos> You scared us.<eos> [sighs] What's going on?<eos> Listen, you need to get in there right away.
Get down!<eos> Get down on the ground!<eos> - [grunts] - All the way, face down!<eos> I'm telling you, I will kill this son a bitch!<eos> I ain't playing!<eos> Everybody take a step back now!<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> Everybody, take a deep breath.<eos> Shut the hell up!<eos> I am gonna get in this truck, I'ma plow right through all of you if I got to.
We're all out in the open, completely exposed, and I'm trying to figure out how this doesn't end very badly for everyone.<eos> It doesn't end badly if we succeed.<eos> If we succeed, it won't be the way we planned it.<eos> There you two are.<eos> Ms. Griffin.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Mr. Haas.<eos> Congratulations to you both.<eos> Thank you for coming, Mr. Speaker.<eos> Well, who could deny the two of you?
Ms. Griffin.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Mr. Haas.<eos> Congratulations to you both.<eos> Thank you for coming, Mr. Speaker.<eos> Well, who could deny the two of you?<eos> Have you seen Felix?<eos> I was told that he was looking for me.<eos> I'm still waiting on this general.<eos> You're gonna have to hold him.
Well, who could deny the two of you?<eos> Have you seen Felix?<eos> I was told that he was looking for me.<eos> I'm still waiting on this general.<eos> You're gonna have to hold him.<eos> Bourbon, old-fashioned.<eos> Uh, well, sir, uh, I was wondering if you wouldn't mind explaining to us something<eos> I've always wanted to know about policy.<eos> Ah, there's Felix right there.<eos> Best to you both.
It's almost as good as what Greypool's got.<eos> We're clear now.<eos> I believe you.<eos> I also believe you know about some of my friends' extracurricular activities.<eos> So what?<eos> Am I supposed to be scared?<eos> Look, my team thinks that they can beat you, turn you against each other.<eos> But I know better.<eos> You're all five steps ahead, and no matter what we try, we'll lose.<eos> I just want to make sure that everybody survives in the process, so I want to help you.
Henry, America's had statesmen who couldn't put aside their differences.<eos> Their arrogance watered battlefields with the blood of an entire generation.<eos> Let's be better than those men.<eos> Let's not start another Civil War.<eos> Some differences are too great to be set aside, Madam President.<eos> The vice presidency...<eos> It's yours.<eos> Too late for that.<eos> Even if it comes with my resignation?<eos> To be kept in your safe, postdated several months, enough time for you to secure your confirmation.
Once every few generations, the world is truly transformed.<eos> The new guard takes office, and the old guard swings from the gallows.<eos> Our generation will not be spared that change.<eos> But we need the right people there to guide the rebirth... people like me and you.<eos> Assuming I want to betray my country, which I don't, what makes me the right woman for this job?<eos> Your people are titans, influencers, industrialists.<eos> They're not heroes.<eos> You're a hero.<eos> You're a leader.<eos> The public will believe you.

The public will turn to you when the time is right.<eos> Think it over.<eos> When you find your senses, pick up your phone and say so.<eos> Who do I call?<eos> Anyone.<eos> We'll be listening.<eos> Thanks for the dance.<eos> The bunker where we operate is two levels underground,<eos> EMP-shielded, blast-protected, self-contained air and water system, able to withstand a nuclear blast.<eos> I'll get you the blueprints.
If you give me some time, I can bring you two more.<eos> So, this is what our friendship is now?<eos> You sneaking around my house, trying to break into my e-mail?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Keep it up, you're gonna get a lot of good people hurt.<eos> Right now, all I'm doing is what I have to do to survive.<eos> And all these people with you and the wrong woman in jail... and using your own fiancée, the only person in this entire place who's truly good?<eos> I can't believe you're on their side.<eos> You have no idea what side I'm on.<eos> I've offered you the vice presidency, my resignation.
My God!<eos> I don't know if I should be frightened or jealous.<eos> Us, one, slimy guys, negative infinity.<eos> Though they did get my favourite suede shoes.<eos> You wore suede? !<eos> What is it, your first day?<eos> Thank God you two showed up.<eos> The Earp girls.<eos> Who knew?<eos> And to add insult to injury, you're stuck with me.
Just enter through the hole.<eos> - Easy.<eos> - Careful.<eos> I like the open floor plan.<eos> Yeah. There's so much natural light.<eos> Yeah.<eos> A lot of that's the explosion.<eos> All I have left is one decorative throw pillow and my robot vacuum... [vacuum whirring]<eos> [crashes] Which just committed suicide.<eos> Well, before you get any ideas, um, we got a little surprise for you.
I...<eos> May I?<eos> Oh. I have something important to talk to you about.<eos> [whispering] Oh, my God, it's happening. I'm finally getting my promotion.<eos> Wendy, thank you for letting me borrow this dress.<eos> Great.<eos> Nice to meet you, cat woman.<eos> Oh, this is a loaner.<eos> Aliens blew up my condo. Heh. Yeah.<eos> - You got the promotion? - [groans]
We don't want the real criminal to know what we're doing.<eos> I think Harry would be an asset to this team.<eos> You're no longer in Her Majesty's service.<eos> They threw me out after I exposed their mission here.<eos> - Jon Jeffries.<eos> - I'm Sasha Barinov.<eos> I'm covering this for the Journal.<eos> Ryan Booth.<eos> And we're just worried about you.<eos> Yeah, well, you should be worried about me getting killed.
Nice to see some familiar faces.<eos> Oh, I didn't know it was "bring your son to work day."<eos> Hmm? What?<eos> What, he's in charge?<eos> Really?<eos> George Dubya Bush?<eos> Told you this would be a waste of time.<eos> Hey, look, Harry's just being Harry, okay?<eos> Can you help us or not?<eos> Well, I could tell you a little over a year ago,
Is that what you want to happen?<eos> Alex, Harry, if he was so sure you were lying, you'd both be dead already.<eos> Just maintain your cover.<eos> You want to know who we really are?<eos> I'm Henry bloody Gould.<eos> And Reema here came to offer you a job, so either accept or pull the pissing trigger.<eos> - You can never be too careful, huh?<eos> - Right.<eos> If you would like a testimonial on Brookwell,<eos> I have a number I can get you.
If you picked up your phone, I wouldn't have had to brief you in person.<eos> Brief me?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> Ms. Amin, I think you've done enough.<eos> Nimah, what do you have?<eos> I checked the crime reports from Brookwell over the last few days, and I know why Greypool is here.<eos> They're not looking for a thing.<eos> They're looking for a person.<eos> Who are you?<eos> What do you want?

But you need to put your weapon down now.<eos> No, you're... you're lying.<eos> You're here to kill me and get rid of the evidence.<eos> We're here to...<eos> We are here to save you from those people.<eos> I'm FBI.<eos> He's CIA.<eos> Trust me, we're the good guys.<eos> Look, Greypool is right above us.<eos> You pull that trigger, you're next.
Hello, police.<eos> Anybody home?<eos> Hello, police.<eos> Anybody here?<eos> Hello. Hey, police.<eos> Anybody here?<eos> Ma'am, are you okay?
He has a retention hearing next week to determine if he should be released.<eos> That's just a formality in these cases.<eos> Not this time.<eos> What is this?<eos> A confession for the same murder you put on Kindler.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> One Pete Cabbad is claiming responsibility.<eos> You're saying I put an innocent man away for the past ten years?<eos> He's not innocent.<eos> You of all people know his criminal history.
Owen Sarni?<eos> Yes?<eos> I'm Officer Reagan, this is Officer Janko.<eos> We responded to your wife's call today.<eos> I'm so sorry for your loss.<eos> I'll grab some coffee.<eos> Uh, please, uh, tell me what went wrong.<eos> We don't know yet, but we were hoping you could help us clear a few things up before we fill our report out.<eos> Whatever I can do.<eos> Do you know what pharmacy your wife's epinephrine came from?
As one of the one percent of them who are dangerous.<eos> And how long of a road are we talking about?<eos> Indefinite.<eos> Indefinite?<eos> This confession doesn't change anything?<eos> It has an impact, but like I said, these incidents are indicative...<eos> I'm gonna need a copy of those reports.<eos> You know you're testifying, not prosecuting here.<eos> And if you want me to testify, you tell me what I need to know.<eos> I've got something you should know, Erin.
Phone calls, texts. Even videos...<eos> How long?<eos> Around six months.<eos> Did you know his wife?<eos> Of course.<eos> That didn't bother you?<eos> Owen and I aren't in love or anything.<eos> We just work long hours in a high-adrenaline job.<eos> It just sort of happened.<eos> Owen ever say anything to you about leaving his wife?
Yes, she said it!<eos> All right, fine, I...<eos> No, no, yo-you don't have to.<eos> No, I do! You don't!<eos> I would never threaten my wife, or even joke about it.<eos> But you're right, Detective, I was having an affair.<eos> Is that why you missed the call?<eos> Yeah, Michelle didn't want to go.<eos> She hated seeing Sharyn.<eos> Because Michelle runs your life and tells you what to do, and you just listen, huh?
You really don't think this man is dangerous?<eos> If you're asking my opinion, I think he would never have ended up in this hospital if he wasn't falsely accused of murder in the first place.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I might ask you the same question.<eos> You first.<eos> Cynthia and I are trying a trial separation.<eos> And how long's that been?<eos> Couple of months.<eos> How many is that?<eos> The third, if you're keeping score.
But I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> As you always...<eos> And my actions don't affect the 35,000 cops, or the eight million citizens.<eos> As you always say, "optics, appearances, perceptions."<eos> As a friend, swallow your pride and fall on your sword.<eos> Or resign.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay what?<eos> Okay, I understand my options.<eos> And I never for a second thought that the comps and the strokes were about anything but my proximity to you.
That's okay.<eos> You don't need to come any further.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you for helping to get me out of, um that place.<eos> It feels good to be free again.<eos> Very good.<eos> Well, it was the right decision.<eos> I'm so glad that you saw it that way.<eos> I brought you something.
It feels good to be free again.<eos> Very good.<eos> Well, it was the right decision.<eos> I'm so glad that you saw it that way.<eos> I brought you something.<eos> Mr. Kindler, put down-- put...<eos> Whoa. I mean you...<eos> Get your hands out of your pockets,<eos> I want to see both hands up.<eos> I mean you no harm, Ms. Reagan.

Too many of us have met our ends here.<eos> - How dare they!<eos> - You folks here for a tour?<eos> People usually bring their kids.<eos> Oh, we're kids at heart.<eos> Captain Ewan Allenbach.<eos> What do you think of our house?<eos> We were just admiring the symbol out front.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Um, if you're interested, we're always looking for new volunteers.
Yeah.<eos> - Wynonna... not like this.<eos> - I will shoot every beak-billed, leg day-loving last one of you.<eos> Where is she?<eos> - On the homestead?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey!<eos> Listen, we all wanna send this Mikshun back to Hell, right?<eos> We got the emollient that works.<eos> All you gotta do is just...
- Previously on "Wynonna Earp"...<eos> - I'm not a bad person, and if you know what's good for you, stop treating me like one.
So this is good news, right?<eos> I mean, no more blood contract!<eos> - Yeah, no more backup either.<eos> - Then who is paying us?<eos> - Does this mean I'm fired?<eos> - We are free agents.<eos> Free to make our own rules and to pursue our own objectives.<eos> Welcome to the club.<eos> I've been here a while.<eos> I'll show you what areas are off limits.
- Zip it, Algebra.<eos> - okay.<eos> I'm going to go.<eos> - The hell you are.<eos> - The hell I am!<eos> I'm gonna go find that seal!<eos> Anyone want a snack?<eos> Doc, do you want a snack?<eos> I'm gonna get...<eos> I'm gonna get you a snack. Okay.
Admit it.<eos> - You've missed this.<eos> - Whole town's been asleep for weeks.<eos> This isn't fun anymore.<eos> I want my prize now.<eos> - Shut up, Tucker.<eos> - Time is running out.<eos> That's unacceptable.<eos> We need more.<eos> You should accept that you've failed.
My fiancée says I'm too tough on you.<eos> Maxine Griffin, founder of The Roster.<eos> If you want me to drop the story, then you give me something else to take its place.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - I owe you.<eos> Well, how about you buy me dinner?<eos> - I don't pay for stories.<eos> - Well, I'll buy you dinner.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We won't be able to fulfill our promise to you.
Is that what I am now... "this"?<eos> Okay, I don't know what you are, drunk maybe?<eos> No.<eos> Stupid.<eos> Stupid to ever think that anyone would want me here but you.<eos> Do you know what, guys?<eos> I don't work in teams.<eos> I never have.<eos> And to be honest, I don't think many of you like it, either.<eos> But I will tell you something.
Well, yes.<eos> - I think that we are all agreed on that.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Um, if you don't mind, I would like, to check in with my mother.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - See if she's okay with all of this.<eos> She had the person that she wanted, but we like to do things our own way.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Max, why don't you ask Rebecca about the last weddings that she's done?<eos> The upstairs gallery is lined with personal photographs from previous events that I've done, - so let me show you, Maxine.
Yeah.<eos> Max, why don't you ask Rebecca about the last weddings that she's done?<eos> The upstairs gallery is lined with personal photographs from previous events that I've done, - so let me show you, Maxine.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Ms. Sherman, um, in the interest of both your time and the First Family's safety, I'd like to address some logistics before you start, if you don't mind.<eos> Call me Rebecca, please.<eos> And it's not a problem.<eos> I've been through this a hundred times.<eos> You go on up.<eos> I'll join you.
You know my coffee order.<eos> I pay attention.<eos> You need a favor.<eos> You're good.<eos> You ever think about government work?<eos> I have a feeling I'm about to do some for you.<eos> So your last event with the Secret Service was two years ago?<eos> How does one of America's heroes wind up doing protective detail for the First Family?<eos> I decided to pursue a life that was a little less, um, involved.<eos> Aren't you bored?

Mostly things about your family.<eos> Your childhood.<eos> Could I...<eos> Could I run some of the details by you?<eos> Like, did you have a pet growing up?<eos> - A dog?<eos> - She talked about Dale?<eos> I went to Miss Porter's, not Dalton.<eos> She's a moron.<eos> Why are you running this piece?
Let's get it.<eos> If you're nervous, don't be.<eos> It's normal, okay?<eos> You're not alone.<eos> I thought I would be scared, but now that I'm here, I feel ready.<eos> The shadow these people have cast over my life this past year, you have no idea what it's done to me, my marriage, my relationship with my children.<eos> I'm afraid to see them, afraid to even call them for fear of putting them in jeopardy.<eos> But when this is done, after you've helped Stewart and me find safe passage, even if it means spending the rest of our days in Greenland,<eos> I'll be able to breathe again.<eos> But you'll have to give it all up.
My career will outlive me at this point.<eos> That's the thing about women like us, Alex...<eos> Our achievements will always be bigger than we are.<eos> Well, those achievements don't really leave too much room for anything else.<eos> Or, at least that's how I like to explain my love life.<eos> A woman bright, brave, and selfless enough... to save our country from crisis not only once, but twice?<eos> That woman doesn't belong to any man or agency or bureau.<eos> She belongs to history.<eos> What if my place in history costs me... everyone that I love along the way?<eos> You have to choose.
Not only is this the 500th anniversary, but we commemorate this, Princess Rapunzel's very first festival.<eos> (applauding and cheering)<eos> To mark this joyous event, our princess has redesigned the Gopher Grab seal of goodwill.<eos> (applauding and cheering)<eos> Ladies and gentlemen of Corona, Princess Rapunzel.<eos> - (crowd cheering and applauding) - (laughs) Thank you so much.<eos> Aw! You're all too kind.<eos> Man (with gravelly voice):<eos> Boo!<eos> And a boo to you too, sir!
♪ I'm ready to follow it who knows where ♪<eos> ♪ I'll get there, I swear ♪<eos> ♪ With the wind in my hair ♪<eos> Challenge of the Brave?<eos> Looks like some kind of tournament.<eos> (chuckles) Not just any tournament.<eos> I hear the fiercest fighters from all over are coming<eos> - to compete!<eos> - Whoa!<eos> Let me tell you, whoever walks away champ will have earned the respect of every warrior in the seven kingdoms.
You're the one that's gonna walk out of this in pieces.<eos> I look forward to makin' everyone who ever loved you cry their eyes out.<eos> (chuckles)<eos> Listen, mister, trash talk is one thing, but that was just mean.<eos> - Rapunzel...<eos> - Uh, Cassandra has feelings,<eos> - you know?<eos> - Aw, poor little baby.<eos> - (chuckles)<eos> - And another thing, you should be...

- We're not going anywhere until we have a word.<eos> - You can't walk into my house like this.<eos> This is my premises and I haven't had any rent off you in six months.<eos> - So you've come to intimidate me?<eos> - I'm not intimidating you.<eos> - He's intimidating me.<eos> - He's not intimidating you.<eos> - I feel intimidated.<eos> - There's no need for it.<eos> - You're going to have to go.

Yeah, sure.<eos> I've dragged you all the way here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know all your stuff's getting damp?<eos> The people who had the house before me said they damp-proofed it in the '90s.<eos> That's the problem with water, especially under the ground, you know, in a house like this.<eos> - It finds a way of getting back in.<eos> - Is there anything I can do?<eos> The damp courses they have these days, they're pretty good.<eos> - I can give you a price if you want.
Your accent, where's it from?<eos> Liverpool?<eos> No, close.<eos> It's Crosby.<eos> Ah, like The Beatles, Ringo Starr.<eos> I don't sound anything like The Beatles, I'll have you know.<eos> I'm far more of a La's fan, me.<eos> I'm from Dublin originally, but I moved out with my Dad when I was young.<eos> Parents broke up, you know.<eos> Who were those girls helping you put flyers in the doors earlier?
Of course I don't.<eos> Look, there was something going on and now there isn't.<eos> You want to come in here so we can joke about it?<eos> Because I'll tell you straight off, the school has an ethos.<eos> Philip is a married man.<eos> He has children, Paula.<eos> Hang on, are you going to talk to him about this as well?<eos> Talk to him?<eos> If I have to.<eos> Well, he'll tell you the same thing.
You're just going to fucking take my daughter and fuck off without telling me?<eos> !<eos> Yeah, and I'm telling you now!<eos> Get in the van.<eos> No!<eos> Please!<eos> Stop crying!<eos> Hiya, James.<eos> Landlord's inspection.<eos> I told you not to come in here.
!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> 'Yeah.<eos> OK, I'll come now.'<eos> Detective Sergeant McArthur.<eos> Thanks for this.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> I know you must be reeling from this news, and I appreciate you coming down here to see us.<eos> I'll tell you the reason that I'm here.

- In the afternoon.<eos> Y-Y-You didn't meet him on Thursday evening?<eos> - No.<eos> - Did you talk to him when he called?<eos> Where were you?<eos> - At home.<eos> - All night?<eos> Can anyone verify that?<eos> You live on your own?<eos> And did he seem in any kind of trouble to you, anything worrying him?

- Hey, Kurt.<eos> - Jane.<eos> How's Zapata?<eos> I'm on my way to see her now.<eos> How's the new living situation going?<eos> Good.<eos> I'm a little concerned about Roman.<eos> I mean, he goes from the safe house to therapy and back home again every single day.<eos> He's out of his cage but he's not exactly out in the world.<eos> Why don't you guys come over for dinner tonight?
You think it could be Hartley?<eos> I mean, that would be a pretty serious May-December romance, but anything's possible.<eos> You know, Devon was arrested for moving arms, so maybe she was getting weapons for Sandstorm from this guy.<eos> Get a team to bring him in and tell 'em to use extreme caution.<eos> We have to keep him in custody.<eos> If he does have connections to Sandstorm, I don't want him tipping them off.<eos> You recognize her?<eos> Sure.<eos> That's Stella.<eos> Can you tell me her full name?
She's gonna be okay, but she's in the infirmary.<eos> - Who did it?<eos> - Another inmate, Liz, the same girl I picked a fight with.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> We've got to get Devon out now, all right?<eos> I'll make a deal, get her charges dropped.<eos> Once she's out, we can track her back to Parker.<eos> She's being held without bail, awaiting trial.<eos> You release her now, she's gonna know something's up.<eos> It's clearly not safe in there for either of you anymore.
- Who do you work for?<eos> - I work for you!<eos> All right, I know I screwed up.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Keep working.<eos> Patterson, what have you got for us?<eos> Actually, this is Stuart, one of the lab techs.<eos> Where's Patterson, Stuart?<eos> She had to step away, but there was an alert that you should know about.
I...<eos> I overreacted.<eos> I just... I had...<eos> I'm finding it hard to trust people right now.<eos> Given what happened with Dr. Borden, the fact that you didn't realize he was working for Sandstorm, has that caused you to question your judgment?<eos> Do you trust yourself?<eos> Do I trust myself?<eos> I second-guess myself every minute of every day.<eos> What Dr. Borden did was unforgivable, but it's not your fault.<eos> You need to put that to rest.
Do you trust yourself?<eos> Do I trust myself?<eos> I second-guess myself every minute of every day.<eos> What Dr. Borden did was unforgivable, but it's not your fault.<eos> You need to put that to rest.<eos> What do you think I'm trying to do?<eos> After he shot me... and disappeared, I wanted to bring him in. I wanted to...<eos> I wanted to make him pay for what he did, just to get some kind of closure, but he... he stole that from me.<eos> Dr. Borden is gone now.<eos> He can't hurt you anymore.
It didn't matter.<eos> I saw all the signs, I just kept pushing them away.<eos> Kurt, what if it's only a matter of time before I become like that?<eos> We're not our families.<eos> Jane, I know who you are.<eos> That is not who you are.<eos> Assistant Director Weller?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Secret Service, sir.<eos> You need to come with us.
This is the dawn of a new America.<eos> It's time to take back our country.<eos> Send this to the "Times" tomorrow morning.<eos> It sounded like a victory speech.<eos> We lost today, didn't we?<eos> This is as far as we go.<eos> Surrender your phone and gun, sir.<eos> I'm not surrendering anything.<eos> These are standard Deputies Committee security protocols, sir.<eos> All you have to do is sign.
Hey, Weller, it's, uh, it's me again.<eos> I just... I was just calling to check in on you, make sure you're okay.<eos> I'm worried about you, so call me back.<eos> Eleanor Hirst, acting director.<eos> I'm Sam Pellington's replacement.<eos> Oh, uh, I'm... I'm Jane.<eos> Please, I know who you are.<eos> How are you holding up?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm so sorry. What you all went through...
Not since Secret Service picked him up last night.<eos> I'm sure he'll check in when he can.<eos> Look, I've been going over your file.<eos> Your deal with Pellington, with Nas Kamal, it essentially makes you prisoner of the FBI.<eos> But once this Sandstorm mess gets cleaned up, you'll be freed of any further obligation, given a new identity and relocated to... wherever it is you'd like to go.<eos> I'm a part of this team.<eos> Nobody's saying you're not.<eos> But Jane, ever since you came out of that bag, every aspect of your life has been decided for you.<eos> Hell, even your name.<eos> I think you need to ask yourself, what do you want?
What if we could contain the fallout?<eos> Okay, there's a defunct railroad tunnel just outside of D.C.<eos> It'll limit the fallout's range and prevent some of it from entering the atmosphere.<eos> But you're gonna have to get there before impact, and... you're not gonna make it back.<eos> You stay with Shepherd.<eos> I'm gonna take the truck.<eos> No, I'm not letting you go alone.<eos> Whoever takes that truck is not coming back.<eos> So, you stay with Shepherd.<eos> You both have to go.
- Thank you, ma'am.<eos> - You did it.<eos> We did it.<eos> We all did it.<eos> Every one of you in this room, you all made this possible.<eos> Since Jane got here, you've all worked non-stop to find who did this and why.<eos> And you've risked your lives and sacrificed so much to get the answers that we needed to stop Sandstorm and bring them to justice.<eos> And yesterday, we didn't just take down their leader.<eos> We saved a nation.<eos> So, thank you and well done to all of you.
And I brought in individuals like, uh...<eos> Alice Winter, the former CEO of Greypool, to be a part of my national security team.<eos> And she's putting together a list of would-be registrants as we speak.<eos> So, when the Congress... passes the registry officially, we can hit the ground running. Look, it's the first step in a long road. Really, I'm just getting started.<eos> You've also passed orders to strengthen the military, increase border security, and you've asked Defense Secretary Howell to draft a memo on how to defeat the Islamic Front.<eos> Can you talk more about that? We have never been more vulnerable in this country than we are today.<eos> We've suffered significant intelligence failures, both foreign and domestic, under the Haas administration.<eos> The CIA failed to prevent an Islamic Front attack at the G20.<eos> And just a few days ago, he FBI suffered an attack... in their own backyard. You have to stop calling me.<eos> - And you have to get me out of here.

You poke your head up for air, you'll be thrown in a hole so deep, no one will find you.
Let's re-look at this. [Cellphone clicking]<eos> [Rings]<eos> Clay: Now, look, I already called Caleb back.<eos> I told him I'm fine, so no need to worry.<eos> So, can you please stop calling?<eos> Because every time it rings, I want to throw it out the window.<eos> You can put it on silent. Hmm.<eos> - Are you smoking? - No. You are.<eos> Well, you're not in D.C. You're at the Hampton Court Motor Lodge in Springfield, Virginia, where possession is a misdemeanor. Are you calling me from 1955?<eos> You already tracked my phone, and my Sims are arguing in the kitchen. We need your help to narrow down the list of targets.
I know.<eos> You're right.<eos> But I'm gonna munch the cake batter while we do it.<eos> If you don't eat the raw egg fast, it makes you even more sick.<eos> - Never mind, let's go.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Okay, girls.<eos> There's something called prejudice, which comes from the Latin words "pre," or "before,"<eos> and "judicium," which means "to judge."<eos> Are you with me so far?
Are you with me so far?<eos> - both: No. - No.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um, you know how it's tougher in this world to be a woman?<eos> both: It is?<eos> No. No, no, no.<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> Then I don't want to be a woman.<eos> - Me neither.<eos> - You don't have to be if that's who you are... you know what?
The girls told me what you talked about, and it couldn't have been easy.<eos> I'm sorry I told them orgasms was another word for oranges.<eos> I panicked.<eos> Yeah, it did make it awkward when they asked for orgasm juice this morning, but I was more talking about the other stuff.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We didn't really know what to say.<eos> At one point, I'm pretty sure I sang all of En Vogue's "Free Your Mind."<eos> Well, they had fun, and you made 'em feel safe.<eos> You did good.<eos> Oh. They made you a "thank you" card.

They made you a "thank you" card.<eos> Pretty sure my nose isn't quite this big, especially with all the racial sensitivity talk, but I appreciate the effort.<eos> Sergeant Jeffords.<eos> A moment of your time, please.<eos> I came to a realization after you stormed out last night.<eos> I wouldn't say I stormed out.<eos> I shook hands with both you and Kevin before I left.
Terry put Lo-V IRT Pullman rolling stock on a ballastless track.<eos> I was dying, Kevin, dying.<eos> Yes, you can hang up now.<eos> I guess we're condemned... to a life of solo railroading.<eos> - We don't have to be.<eos> I know we've had our differences, but through some crazy twist of fate we found each other.<eos> Shouldn't we just be excited that we have someone to share that with?<eos> - Not interested.<eos> - Good day. - Okay.<eos> - Well, I just wanted to show you I got a tiny little train inspector.
He's her lover.<eos> He's your mother lover. He's lovering your mother.<eos> - What?<eos> - That's not true.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> - I would know if she were seeing someone.<eos> - She told me last night.<eos> They've been together for two years.<eos> - I see.<eos> - And she asked me not to say anything to you.
- Tell me where he is.<eos> I'm gonna count to three.<eos> There will not be a four.<eos> - Okay, fine, he was here this morning, but I didn't buy anything.<eos> Here, he left this number in case I change my mind.<eos> - Uh, thank you.<eos> - Here you go, Lieutenant.<eos> - "There will not be a four."<eos> "Die Hard." Nice.<eos> - You like "Die Hard"?
Right now?<eos> Okay, well, it makes me feel pretty annoyed. - Good.<eos> Go on.<eos> - It grates my cheese.<eos> I mean, it just really grates my cheese. Grr!<eos> - Oh, Santiago, you're faking.<eos> - Faking? What?<eos> Uh, did you hear that "grr"?<eos> - Just admit it.<eos> - Okay, fine, I was faking the whole time, but I only did it because I wanted you to enjoy it.
- Santiago, face facts.<eos> - I'm garbage.<eos> - No, this is about me and my issues with authority.<eos> - You've been great.<eos> - Wrong, I've been a disaster.<eos> - I can't believe you would blame yourself for this.<eos> - How stupid are you?<eos> - So stupid.<eos> - I'm such a stupid head.<eos> - The fact that you think this has anything to do with you is insane.
Stay.<eos> Stay, stay.<eos> Eat it!<eos> God, I'm gonna make a great dad someday.<eos> - You got Ocampo?<eos> - Oh, yeah, and you'll never guess where we found him.<eos> In the bathroom... not going.<eos> He was hiding.<eos> I ruined the story.<eos> - Did he give you any info about the Golden Gang bank robbers?
Stay, stay.<eos> Eat it!<eos> God, I'm gonna make a great dad someday.<eos> - You got Ocampo?<eos> - Oh, yeah, and you'll never guess where we found him.<eos> In the bathroom... not going.<eos> He was hiding.<eos> I ruined the story.<eos> - Did he give you any info about the Golden Gang bank robbers?<eos> - No, we thought we'd leave that to you.
No, babe, we don't want you to kill anyone.<eos> - What?<eos> Really?<eos> - No. We need to make Lieutenant Hawkins think that Diaz and Peralta are dirty.<eos> When you went undercover in the mob, how did you convince them you could be trusted?<eos> Easy.<eos> You just take one of their guys and beat him to a pulp in front of them.<eos> Well, that's all well and good, but we're not actually dirty.<eos> We can't just beat somebody up.<eos> What if that someone gave you permission?
Why do you even own that?<eos> I was banned from Wing Sluts for using too much sauce, so I got it to sneak past the hostess.<eos> So far it has not worked.<eos> Wait, look.<eos> There's no fancy lunch.<eos> There's no fancy guy.<eos> She lied to us.<eos> "Redacted" my ass.<eos> What's up?<eos> So not sure if Paxton told you, but we brought a perp in earlier.
Oh. Whoa, where did you get this?<eos> - Adrian, that's enough. - Oh.<eos> We can make fake cocaine for ourselves - out of vitamin B powder. - Ooh, vitamin B.<eos> - The second-best vitamin.<eos> - Guys, I'm telling you.<eos> The fake snorting can work.<eos> Oh, I got so much that time.<eos> Whoa, ooh, anybody wanna listen to Jamiroquai right now?<eos> Okay, I'm just gonna move this away from your nose holes.<eos> Well, you two should get going.
- It's called a bottle of whiskey.<eos> - I like your style.<eos> You know, when I first met you two, I thought you were pretty uptight.<eos> More like down loose.<eos> That's nothing.<eos> Hey, about the interrogation room.<eos> Don't even worry about it.<eos> Sometimes you gotta do stuff.<eos> Me and my crew, sometimes we gotta do stuff too.<eos> Understood, and hey, look, if you ever need help doing stuff, - maybe keep us in mind.
I get to help!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I can feel my legs again.<eos> I can walk.<eos> Yes!<eos> It's a miracle kind of.<eos> See?<eos> When the Nine-Nine puts our brains together, we can achieve anything.<eos> Hey, we should team up and rob banks for real!<eos> You should stop talking in the hallway.
Look, if you let me slowly reach into my jacket pocket, there's an article open on my phone that will explain everything.<eos> That's a video of a monkey humping a frog.<eos> What?<eos> Oh. That's my bad.<eos> It was a long ride up here, and I got bored.<eos> Here.<eos> Close that tab.<eos> That's the article.<eos> Hawkins ran you out of New York and took away your life.<eos> If you help us, maybe we can help you get it back.
Just put on anything by Enya.<eos> No, not anything. "Orinoco Flow." On repeat.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> You are?<eos> You'll testify?<eos> Hawkins has cost me and my wife too many years of happiness.<eos> I'm not gonna let her do the same to you.<eos> Thank you so much.

- And Teague can help us get there, sir.<eos> - I really believe that.<eos> - The answer is no, Charles.<eos> But it was a very impassioned pitch, so je vous remercie.<eos> Means "thank you" in French.<eos> Jason Antolotti on one.<eos> Good morning, Jason. I'm here with Charles Greane.<eos> Larry, Chuck, let's talk Teague.<eos> - Way ahead of you, J. Been trying to...<eos> Look, you guys need a division title and my man will deliver like Amazon, all right?

Hey!<eos> Wait up!<eos> Oh, great.<eos> You left something at home.<eos> A big hug! Oh!<eos> I found it right next to these kisses.<eos> It's too late for me.<eos> Save yourself.<eos> So, are you excited to have your own place again?<eos> I am, but I'll miss you guys.
Tonight he wants to look at ladders at Home Depot.<eos> Oh, why does he need a ladder?<eos> He doesn't; he just likes looking at them.<eos> Bring a book.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> You may remember Dr. Nowitzki,<eos> She's back at Caltech for her postdoc.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hi. Oh, let me bring a chair for you.
Great.<eos> Anybody's better than, mmm.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> They took out my spleen and gallbladder, not my feelings.<eos> Dr. Nowitzki.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Good to see you, too.<eos> May I join you?<eos> No.<eos> Good to see you.
Who?<eos> Uh, excuse me?<eos> Do you validate the parking?<eos> Oh, no, that's not me.<eos> I'm actually the Senior Vice President of Research and Development.<eos> Oh, but you sit at the receptionist's desk?<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> That's the receptionist's desk.<eos> This is the Senior Vice President's desk.<eos> I'll just get you the stickers.

You prepared to run similar ops with American citizens on domestic soil?<eos> As the convention grows near and National Security Council member Maxwell Fletcher rolls out his plan for a new domestic intelligence agency...<eos> - We're gonna be here all night. - ... Washington insiders are wondering,<eos> "Who's running the White House...<eos> - Roarke or Fletcher?" - [Sighs] So, anyone?<eos> I wouldn't give these people a badge, a gun, or my Amazon Prime password.<eos> One guy told me he loved America more than his mom... and then he asked me out.<eos> Nice.<eos> ♪<eos> Would you be willing to go undercover in a hostile country?

Oh, baby, I have come down in the world.<eos> How do you like that?
That's how bad that is.<eos> It's like not taking a shit. That's what I think.<eos> I think abortion is exactly like taking a shit.<eos> I think it is 100% the exact same thing as taking a shit.<eos> Or it isn't. [audience laughing]<eos> It is, or it isn't.<eos> It's either taking a shit, or it's killing a baby. [audience laughing]<eos> It's only one of those two things.<eos> It's no other things.<eos> If you didn't like hearing it's like taking a shit, you think it's killing a baby.

So, you take this random dog and just put it in your house with your family, and watch their personality unfold.<eos> This dog is insane.<eos> I'll walk into the kitchen, and the dog is just standing there alone like this... [audience laughing]<eos> I'm like, "You all right?<eos> Are you all right?"<eos> My kids are terrified of the dog.<eos> My daughter goes to pet the dog, dog goes like...<eos> She's like, "Should I pet her?" "I don't think you should ever pet our dog, honey."<eos> I took her to the vet. I took the dog to ask her what to do.<eos> The vet said, "Listen, I think there's something you should seriously consider."

[audience laughing]<eos> My daughter is learning about Greek mythology.<eos> And she's asking me questions about it.<eos> She's like, "Daddy, who's Achilles' mother?"<eos> I said, "I don't fucking know.<eos> Don't ask me that shit.<eos> I don't know who Achilles' mother." Don't yell out if you know.<eos> "It's Campampetes." Nobody cares what you know. [audience laughing]<eos> She had a question about Achilles, it was interesting.<eos> I'll tell it to you.
And she dipped him in the water of the River Styx because there was a magical quality to that water that you would make you impervious of any harm.<eos> You couldn't be hurt.<eos> It was like a shield, right?<eos> So, she dipped him in that water to protect him.<eos> But she held him by the heel.<eos> That's the important detail.<eos> Held him by the heel, which is an awkward way to hold a baby.<eos> By the heel.<eos> Try holding a baby by the heel and dipping it in a river.<eos> You will never see that baby again.

If you're looking at the best dick ever, and you're not sure... you wanna suck it, just put it in your mouth.<eos> And then decide.<eos> Just for like 20 seconds.<eos> [woman] Whoo!<eos> That's a long time. That's 20 seconds.<eos> That's a long time to have a dick in your mouth... that you're ambivalent about. [audience laughing]<eos> It's 20 sec--<eos> If you have a dick in your mouth for 20 seconds, you are not deciding.<eos> Twenty seconds. This is-<eos> - I'll show you.
Yeah, I'm all right.<eos> What was that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Can I help you, buddy?<eos> Just having a breather.<eos> Yeah, did you just bang on my roof?<eos> I put my drink down.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Are you having some kind of a funny turn?
Killjoy.<eos> You've upset her.<eos> Mm!<eos> You've upset me.<eos> We work our bollocks off all during the week.<eos> The one night of the year when we party... and you're pissing on our bonfire. Come on, John, it's a party.<eos> There, happy?<eos> - Oh, I love this. - Turn it up... - # Because you're beautiful... #<eos> Don't put you off your driving, sorry.<eos> 'Ah, what a lovely message. 'We'll dedicate the next song to you guys.
- Why? - Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> - Yeah, I would.<eos> I am saying nothing.<eos> I might be many things but I am not a gossip.<eos> Go on, what have you heard?<eos> Well, we all know who you'll be picking for your Christmas team this year, I'll put it that way.<eos> - What do you mean by that?<eos> - You can drop the act, the pair of yous.<eos> Cos you're not fooling no-one.<eos> I told you, you can't con a conner and you can't kid a kidder.
- 'Oh.'<eos> - I don't...<eos> I'll ring you later.<eos> There's quiche in the fridge. OK?<eos> - 'All right.'<eos> - See you, Nan.<eos> - 'Bye.'<eos> - Bye.<eos> Bloody hell!<eos> 'If you think that we sound a bit out of sorts this morning, 'well, we are - we're in a different studio, aren't we, Katie?
You'll forget all about them when you hear what I've got for you.<eos> Intriguing.<eos> All right.<eos> Give me a hint.<eos> Two words:<eos> Charlotte Vandertunt.<eos> The heiress to the Vast Vandertunt Publishing Fortune?<eos> And, by inference, an ideal target for kidnapping.<eos> I'm not kidnapping a Vandertunt.<eos> You don't have to.
I'm trying to escape a quasi-incestuous family situation.<eos> - How?<eos> - A four.<eos> Eh. Yeah, so...<eos> So, presumably, the Vandertunt family still doesn't know where she is?<eos> I mean, don't know how they would.<eos> Excellent.<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> - What?<eos> Mother: Well, then, I suggest you wake him.
Yeah, to ransom her off.<eos> Why? Wh-<eos> - To pay back Trexler.<eos> For what?<eos> What are you--<eos> For the sex slaves Trexler was gonna--<eos> Oh, I get it! Do you?<eos> You're saying this is all my fault.<eos> Isn't it? I-<eos> - Look, this whole fiasco started because I came to you for help!
Eyeglasses, dark hair, gray at the temples, mouth like somebody used a tomato capper to scoop out a pig's asshole and glued it under his nose?<eos> Aw, shit! [door buzzing]<eos> Are you nuts?<eos> Do you wanna get caught?<eos> We're not gonna get caught.<eos> Now shut up, put these on, and follow my lead.<eos> Aw, jeez.<eos> He's really doing it.<eos> [sighs] Sorry, lady.<eos> But if you think about it, which I guess you can't, this whole thing is Archer's fault, so... [muffled gag] [whispering] Will you get in position?
Some of it got in my mouth.<eos> How long was I in there?<eos> How should I know?<eos> Usually dead people don't just climb out of these drawers with their big bushy birds on fire, so for all I know, you're that Zombie - that got walked with!<eos> - That what?<eos> In the movie I walked with a Zombie.<eos> The Zombie Titular.<eos> I'm not a Goddamn...<eos> I am Lieutenant Cyril Figgis, LAPD, you sentient shit-sacks!<eos> - I showed you my shield!
Hey, thanks.<eos> Oh, and if turns out you lose that arm, just give me a call.<eos> I got a guy.<eos> He what?<eos> - Uh, is going to kill you.<eos> - Was I not... what are you talking about?<eos> - Why?<eos> - Stop it!<eos> What, I should be calm when you tell me a Goddamn robot wants to kill me?<eos> No, not you.
Who did pull you out... of the ice?<eos> You did.<eos> Well now, it's an awfully cold day to be stranded this far out of town.<eos> What seems to be the trouble?<eos> You are.<eos> I put you and your sister in a box.<eos> We got out.<eos> So, Juan Carlo...<eos> where is the last seal?<eos> I'll die before I tell you.
Wynonna will love it.<eos> Wait until you see the mocktail list.<eos> So... she's being real friendly all of a sudden.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She seems to have gotten over the whole Wynonna-may-be-carrying- her-boyfriend's-kid thing.<eos> But... good for her.<eos> 'Cause like it or not, you guys are all kind of in this together.<eos> Well, she's hardly said one word to me before today.<eos> Well, hey! Maybe she's intimidated, OK?<eos> You Earps are a party that's tough to crash.
Shut the hell up!<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> Wyatt Earp killed my poor boys.<eos> He will pay for it.<eos> But I have priorities.<eos> Should my demon husband get free, it'll be me running for my life.<eos> His funeral is my freedom.<eos> We need more than earth to hold him though.<eos> Do we have a choice?<eos> Pour this upon the talismans have given you.
So close.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Well, now I'm hungry.<eos> You've tracked the prey.<eos> Now we feast.<eos> Never have I ever swam naked in the ocean.<eos> - Waverly?<eos> - I've never even seen the ocean.<eos> Neither have I.<eos> You girls need to get out more.
Hey.<eos> It's OK.<eos> We'll start doublelocking the front door.<eos> Can we just go inside?<eos> I'm freezing my butt off.<eos> Well, come on!<eos> Now you're the one without a coat.<eos> Wynonna...<eos> Bathroom?<eos> You totally have to pay for that.
Eyes on the prize, peeps.<eos> Eyes on the prize.<eos> Afternoon, sir.<eos> Your sign boasts of antiques and libations.<eos> If the latter includes whiskey, I'll have one of those.<eos> Sakes alive!<eos> Sir, that ring is a rarity.<eos> Bring good coin if you're selling.<eos> I am not.<eos> - Surely you'll want to hear my offer? - Not in the least.
Am I the biggest cliché ever?<eos> No.<eos> I know what you're going through.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> Your father, your sister...<eos> How are you not bitter?<eos> I have my moments.<eos> You're so lovely.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry that Tucker was so awful to both of you.
I'm sorry, I'm-I'm...<eos> I'm just really freaked out and, um, angry.<eos> I'll check the bedrooms.<eos> The last thing we remember, we passed out, and then we woke up locked in this room.<eos> While you say you were asleep, Pervert Gardner Junior kidnapped a girl and held her in my sister's bedroom.<eos> I wish I could say I didn't know it was just a matter of time.<eos> Tucker's out of his tree.<eos> He must have roofied<eos> - the Pinot Grigio.<eos> - So you two don't happen to know a couple of bitches who like to get their Halloween on in creepy, black dresses?
She doesn't need a backrub.<eos> We need you to get your ass in gear<eos> - and find Tucker. - Frankly, he terrifies me.<eos> We'll be watching the house 24-7.<eos> You're watching us?<eos> !<eos> What... what the hell?<eos> It's for your protection.<eos> Yeah, just in case he comes back.<eos> If you have nothing to hide, what's the problem?
I don't know anything about that or I would've told Wynonna!<eos> You may not know you have it, it could be metal or precious and very, very old.<eos> - I'm more of an IKEA kind of girl.<eos> - My lord does not make mistakes!<eos> Get away from her, you bitch!<eos> Pick on someone your own size.<eos> Oh, that's cute.<eos> Neither of us know where the third seal is, Mercedes, but we are available for nose jobs.<eos> Mercedes isn't here right now.<eos> You'll have to play with me.
We've put down demons, witches, even Bobo Del Rey.<eos> You'll join them in the ground soon enough.<eos> Nicole will get there first.<eos> Ta ta for now.<eos> - Wait!<eos> - Waverly!<eos> Hold up.<eos> You got the key to Nicole's place, right? - Yeah.<eos> - I gotta pick up that mongrel cat of hers.<eos> Well, if you hate it that much, I'll take Calamity Jane.
I mean, look, isn't she gorgeous?<eos> Tell me how it is after going through menopause.<eos> Okay, ladies, let's go, we're starting with the cha-cha.<eos> Cha-cha, one, two, three.<eos> Cha-cha, one, two, three.<eos> One, two, three, cha-cha, one, two, three.<eos> Okay, very good.<eos> I'm sorry, it's just summer in the valley.<eos> Why don't you go yourself?<eos> Uh, uh... I just, um, if it's hitting you too strong... I know this, like, shoots out... maybe you can stand further down, like on the other side.
Hi, excuse me, sorry.<eos> Before we "Paso," I just want to say we have a little bit of an air conditioning situation.<eos> I turned the air on and, uh, that woman in the class told me to go myself, so... I just didn't know where the rest of the class landed on, uh, you know, air.<eos> I think we all, you know, want the air on, so... - You yelled [bleep] at us? - No, no, no...<eos> I was just quoting.<eos> She said [bleep], I just...<eos> No, I didn't, no, I didn't.<eos> Are you serious right now? You were bombing all the place.<eos> She said it again!<eos> Because I needed you to hear what she was saying.
Oh, a real estate agent Paul works with turns out to be - a former anal porn star.<eos> - Oh. She's, like, the Sandra Bullock of butt porn.<eos> She works exclusively out of her butt.<eos> Wouldn't that be "in" her butt?<eos> - No.<eos> - Thank you!<eos> See? Married, barely friends.<eos> - Okay, that's why you're married?<eos> - Yeah. - 'Cause you both think like that?<eos> - Yeah. All right, you ing dummies, you're about to see what I'm talking about.
She does half day Saturdays, it's just the results from my physical.<eos> Oh, it's so annoying!<eos> The second you walk away from your phone<eos> - is when the doctor calls. - Yep.<eos> Dr. Katzberg's office.<eos> Hi, it's Andrea Warren calling Dr. Katzberg back.<eos> I'm sorry, she's with a patient.<eos> Wow, already?<eos> What, is she like an Olympic sprinter?<eos> She'll call you back.
Hey, is everything okay?<eos> Yes, Brian, it's not abnormal for a doctor to call with positive to neutral news.<eos> Dr. Katzberg's office.<eos> Hi, yes, it's Andrea Warren.<eos> The doctor just called?<eos> I'm sorry, she's with a patient.<eos> Oh, God, you guys have a busy practice.<eos> What, are you giving out free OxyContin?<eos> If you are, save me one.<eos> Are you looking for OxyContin?
Can't she tell you what's wrong?<eos> Um, I know the doctor's just calling me with my physical results. Can you just give them to me over the phone?<eos> I'm sorry, I'm not authorized to divulge that information.<eos> - She's not authorized to give it.<eos> - Ask her if you sign something... - Well, how am I... - ... if you sign something.<eos> - Listen, I...<eos> - You can sign something and send it over, I have an app on my phone.<eos> Seriously?<eos> - Authorize... - Why don't you hold for the doctor?<eos> She'll call you back.
I just really want to connect with her today.<eos> Well, she just called you. What?<eos> It went to voicemail.<eos> I... no.<eos> We do close at 1:00 today so you really should stay by your phone.<eos> Wait, wait, wait...<eos> I know that you said that you can't divulge anything, but is that because that's just protocol or because there's something to report?<eos> Again, I can't divulge that kind of information.<eos> You know, when you say "divulge" it makes it sound like it's something bad.<eos> She'll call you back.
Well, beating someone off the line doesn't mean that you didn't jump the gun to do it.<eos> And our losses are growing by the day.<eos> Mr. Specter, you'll have your chance to refute him at trial.<eos> All right, listen, you want me to be honest?<eos> I haven't felt prioritized lately.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Who was there when you had to restructure in '07?<eos> Not to mention, I just saved your ass last year.<eos> And that was then.<eos> And now I feel like I can't even get you on the phone anymore.
I'm also the partner that Bratton Gould just lost.<eos> Your Honor, they entered into a fee-waiving partnership agreement yesterday with a company that's suddenly claiming infringement against one of our clients today.<eos> Your Honor, their client caused real damages.<eos> If that's true, those damages will still be there in eight weeks, which means the only reason you'd be upset right now is if this action is nonsense.<eos> So which is it-- eight weeks or drop the case?<eos> Morelli's expense reports for the last three years.<eos> The guy spends more time in Vegas than David Blaine.<eos> And now you know.<eos> Just like you already know that Louis kills for you out there whether he's taking your calls or not.<eos> I'll call you tomorrow about the acquisition, Louis.
- Well, did you make it?<eos> 'Cause I'd hate to think you missed it for nothing.<eos> I'm walking in right now.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm right on time.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Rachel Zane.<eos> Deborah Kaplan.<eos> Did my assistant give you the wrong time?
You'll never know what happened to your son.<eos> And I have another son and two daughters, and this changes their lives.<eos> - Mr. Reyes--<eos> - Are you telling me that you can prove they had something to do with my son's death?<eos> Yes.<eos> I believe that Oliver can get enough to--<eos> - No, not Oliver.<eos> You.<eos> Because you're the one who took my case, and then you backed out.<eos> - I told you, there was a conflict.
Get out the way!<eos> Come on! Get out the way!<eos> Was that a rat?<eos> I'm having a problem with my basement. vermin are getting in.<eos> Will there be more?<eos> I've put some of that poison you had in the box, I put some of that down in a couple of saucers, so just be careful.<eos> Yeah, who were those girls helping you put flyers in the doors earlier?
Strong, good-looking fella.<eos> Who is this?<eos> 'Just a friend.<eos> 'Let me protect you.'<eos> Just give it to me!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God...!<eos> Any sign of a note?<eos> Not so far.<eos> And did he seem in any kind of trouble to you?
Who is this?<eos> 'Just a friend.<eos> 'Let me protect you.'<eos> Just give it to me!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God...!<eos> Any sign of a note?<eos> Not so far.<eos> And did he seem in any kind of trouble to you?<eos> - You'll have to talk to his wife.
Yeah.<eos> And the CCTV?<eos> Let me call you back.<eos> - James Morecroft -- did you arrest him?<eos> - We didn't, no.<eos> My partner's been looking into him, but...<eos> Yeah, fucking great.<eos> I found that... on my windscreen.<eos> Hello.<eos> Let me give you a hand there.
Yeah, fucking great.<eos> I found that... on my windscreen.<eos> Hello.<eos> Let me give you a hand there.<eos> - Yeah, all right, thank you.<eos> - No bother.<eos> Is James about?<eos> - No, sorry, I don't know where he is.<eos> - Well, if you had a sec,<eos> - I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.
It gives me the willies.<eos> Let's knock at the neighbour's.<eos> - I'll just take a look around the back.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Just a look.<eos> - I'll knock in here.<eos> Text me.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Sorry to bother you.<eos> Could I ask you a few quick questions about next door?
Wow, girls, those are massive!<eos> Almost as big as your heads, which is saying something.<eos> - The woman gave us extra!<eos> - Come on.<eos> PHONE RINGS Keep an eye on them, will ya?<eos> Inspector.<eos> Thanks for getting back to me.<eos> - Right, where to now, girls?<eos> - Hall of mirrors.<eos> I'll tell you what it is.
A little girl called Mary.<eos> I'd love to know where she is.<eos> She's gone.<eos> Gone where?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He just... told me one time.<eos> Told you what?<eos> I know he never meant it to happen.<eos> - Never meant what to happen?<eos> - I can't tell you that, all right?
Yeah.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> What?<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> Whose is it?<eos> It's mine.<eos> Right.<eos> OK.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Do you have a table for two?
Where is Lupu Village?<eos> You don't travel much.<eos> I can travel.<eos> This entire structure is a traveling machine.<eos> But... you don't.<eos> Do you?<eos> Maybe you should.<eos> The world is changing.<eos> Travel, like people do.<eos> You might like it.
Travel, like people do.<eos> You might like it.<eos> I've known you two minutes, and you offer for me to walk the earth like an ordinary peasant while I give you the knowledge of immortals, the true science.<eos> My.<eos> They won't be peasants anymore if you teach them.<eos> They won't live such short, scared lives if they have real medicine.<eos> They won't be superstitious if they learn how the world really works.<eos> Why should I do that?<eos> To make the world better.<eos> Start with me, and I'll start with you.
That woman was the only reason on earth for me to tolerate human life!<eos> Then find the one who did the deed.<eos> If you loose an army of the night on Wallachia, you cannot undo it, and many thousands of people just as innocent as her will suffer and die.<eos> There are no innocents!<eos> Not anymore!<eos> Any one of them could have stood up and said,<eos> "No, we won't behave like animals anymore."<eos> I won't let you do it.<eos> I grieve with you, but I won't let you commit genocide.<eos> For twenty years have I served you and God as the Archbishop to Targoviste Cathedral.
The devil himself came to us and threatened us with doom in one year.<eos> And yet, here we are.<eos> The devil lied.<eos> Why should we be surprised?<eos> Do we not know the devil for a liar?<eos> Do we not know his works to be illusion?<eos> Of course we do.<eos> Illusions and falsehoods hold no fear for us, for we are the righteous of Targoviste, living as if cradled in the love of God.<eos> One year.<eos> I gave you one year to make your peace with your God.
Lockwood Energy is about to release a solar panel that looks a hell of a lot like the one you've been developing for years.<eos> - How did you know that?<eos> - Because I didn't spend all morning brushing up on my ass-kissing techniques.<eos> - Then you also know that Lockwood's green division has only existed for three months.<eos> They stole that technology.<eos> - Which is why you should sign with me so I can go get it back.<eos> - I already have a law firm.<eos> Why shouldn't I let them handle this?<eos> - Because you don't want the guy who's gonna sue Lockwood after they've stolen your girlfriend.<eos> You want the guy who's gonna put them in the ground before they get the chance.

Look, why don't you take the week to think it over.<eos> Of course, while you're doing that,<eos> Lockwood's gonna be rushing your product to market, and when they do, your board's gonna be wondering why you didn't hire me when you had the chance.<eos> - All right, Mr. Specter, you win.<eos> You've got three days.<eos> Let's see if you're as good as you think you are.<eos> - You must be Paula Agard.<eos> - I'm sorry, but do we know each other?<eos> - Not yet, but it is a pleasure to meet you.<eos> I'm Louis Litt, and I understand you are looking for a lawyer.
- You must be Paula Agard.<eos> - I'm sorry, but do we know each other?<eos> - Not yet, but it is a pleasure to meet you.<eos> I'm Louis Litt, and I understand you are looking for a lawyer.<eos> - I have a lawyer, and his name's Peter Shumpert.<eos> - Ah, Peter will not be joining you today.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - I mean, I'm sure he's a nice guy, but he's not a litigator.<eos> - Well, I don't see what that has to do with this.<eos> - When an attorney lets a client meet with another attorney, trust me, you need better representation.
- Harvey Specter. - We didn't have a proper introduction the last time we met.<eos> Holly Cromwell.<eos> - What do you want, Ms. Cromwell?<eos> - So much for formalities.<eos> - I got a lot on my plate.<eos> I don't have time for formalities.<eos> - If you brought me on, maybe you would.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Headhunting isn't cutting it for me, Mr. Specter. I want back in the game, and since you're the reason I'm out of the game, you should hire me as a full-time in-house consultant.<eos> - So you want me to give you a handout out of guilt?

- No, I work in suing your ass for trying to pass off Galvadyne's solar panels as your own.<eos> - I don't know who you are, and I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> We developed that technology in-house.<eos> - Oh, bullshit.<eos> That technology takes years to develop, and your entire division's only been in existence<eos> - since last Tuesday.<eos> - What can I say? When you invest in the right talent, you can move mountains, and last I checked, being smarter than your competition wasn't illegal.<eos> - Well, if you're half as smart as you say you are, you'd give us our product back now, or we'll take your company from you later.<eos> - If you're here without the FBI, it means you're just a shakedown artist without a shred of evidence to back up your claims.<eos> - No, it means I'm giving you the chance to make it right.
- Your associate got a name?<eos> - My name's not as important as the questions I have.<eos> Like why did you incite a brawl in the cafeteria during lunch on November 4th of last year?<eos> - What is this? - I thought you were here to talk about reviving my shot at parole.<eos> - We can absolutely talk about that, after you tell us why you conspired with this prison to get your fellow inmates' sentences extended.<eos> - This is bullshit.<eos> - Guard! - Listen, you don't have to talk to us.<eos> But this thing comes out, instead of getting out in five years, you're gonna spend the rest of your life in here.<eos> - All right, what do you wanna know?<eos> - Let's start with who's telling you to pick fights with guys who are about to get out.

- not to sleep with a patient?<eos> - What'd you just say? - I know that she's been running around with Harvey Specter, and it's no surprise that it's his partner defending her.<eos> - Dr. Agard's personal life has no bearing on this case.<eos> - Oh, it'll have plenty of bearing when the ethics board learn that she started dating one of her patients before the mandatory waiting period elapsed.<eos> - That's a bald-faced lie, and now you're twisting facts in order to blackmail my client.<eos> - Blackmail is a serious accusation.<eos> My client never asked for anything in exchange for his silence.<eos> - Well, he sure as shit implied it.<eos> - This meeting's over, Mr. Litt.<eos> Why don't you take the evening to cool down?
- Lockwood's launching a solar panel?<eos> Since when are they in the renewable energy business?<eos> - Since they stole the technology from Galvadyne.<eos> - No way.<eos> - They didn't steal it.<eos> - How can you know that?<eos> - Because there's only six people capable of that kind of work, and if one of them did it, I'd know.<eos> - Well, they got it somehow, and I need to know how they did it.<eos> - That's not a hell of a lot to go on.<eos> - If I had more to go on, I wouldn't need you.
- But what, Louis?<eos> - She also told me that all he wanted to do was get her back.<eos> She felt sorry for him.<eos> I guess I felt sorry for him, too.<eos> - Sorry for him or for yourself?<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Louis, I hate to draw comparisons for you, but is there a chance you're putting yourself in this man's shoes because it's so similar to what happened between you and Tara?<eos> - I didn't cheat on her.<eos> - But you behaved poorly. It ended the relationship, and you wanted her back.<eos> - And I told you that I do not want to talk about getting closure with Tara anymore.

- The kind that determine if you're Pearson Specter Litt material.<eos> - I'm not here for my contract, am I?<eos> I'm here because you have a problem with me.<eos> - I do have a problem with you.<eos> - I see what this is.<eos> - I should have known. I have an MBA from Wharton, I graduated with honors, and you think all I am is a high-priced...<eos> - No, I don't give a shit what you think about sex and men.<eos> My problem is that you're in the betrayal business.<eos> You betray the men that you prey on, and then the only time we had an interaction with you, you turned on your employer.<eos> - Well, why don't you bring that up with your employer?
I informed on real guys about real crimes.<eos> That's how I got out.<eos> - Are you willing to go on the record with this?<eos> Tell me your source?<eos> - It's not gonna be that easy, Mikey.<eos> I'm gonna need an advance on that settlement.<eos> - Please, sit down.<eos> - Glad to see you've come back with a real number, Mr. Litt. - The only number I'm back with is the one that I'm gonna do on your client.<eos> - What the hell?<eos> You said he was ready to cut a check. - Oh, well, what she should have told you, Jacob, is when you threaten someone with blackmail, you better goddamn be ready to defend yourself.

Harvey let his buddy into my firm.<eos> Now he's in my mud.<eos> I mean, what's next?<eos> I walk into my bathroom and I find him shitting on my toothbrush?<eos> Louis, we talked about this.<eos> If you let this overwhelm you, you're going to bring about the thing you're most afraid of.<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> He was in my mud.<eos> How the hell am I not supposed to let that overwhelm me?<eos> Well... has it occurred to you that instead of worrying this Alex person is going to come between you and Harvey, you could use this as an opportunity to make a new friend?

And he was up for parole next month.<eos> There's something they're not telling me.<eos> All right, I'll look into it.<eos> Um, but I'm not gonna be able to get to this for a few days.<eos> A few days.<eos> Why can't you start now?<eos> Because I have a deal with my firm that allows me to do cases like this, but not only cases like this.<eos> And right now, I'm in the middle of something else.<eos> Mr. Ross, the last lawyer I talked to said there was some kind of a statute that says I only have another two weeks to file a lawsuit.<eos> And I'm telling you, two weeks should be more than enough time, but I--I can't drop everything just to take your case.
Apparently Mr. Reyes was in a fight.<eos> He was sent to solitary, where he complained of difficulty breathing.<eos> A doctor was called and delivered treatment.<eos> Unfortunately, he died a few hours later.<eos> Well, if he was in a fight, there has to be an incident report.<eos> That may be, but you have no right to access it.<eos> We're a private corporation.<eos> That's privileged.<eos> Okay, then how about you give me the names of the guards who saw it?<eos> You know I can't give you that either.

Why didn't they take him to an infirmary?<eos> Because he was seen by a doctor.<eos> There was an explanation for his symptoms.<eos> I know you think I'm just a man who can't accept his child's death.<eos> But that's not true.<eos> Mr. Reyes, a fight in prison can elevate your heart rate.<eos> Nobody knows that better than I do.<eos> What they're saying happened is plausible.<eos> Then you didn't know my son.<eos> I told you, he was up for parole next month.
- Accomplished.<eos> - Then perceive a potentially nonexistent slight and go straight to stage seven.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> Panic, sorrow, self-loathing, hatred, justification, self-loathing again, and rage.<eos> I call it the seven stages of Louis.<eos> You are so full of shit, and you're a total fraud, and I'm actually gonna-- ah, uh, I see your point.<eos> Stage 7b.<eos> No one likes a gloater, Stan.<eos> Be that as it may.<eos> You need a strategy, Louis.
Then you better get the hell out of here before it happens again.<eos> I will, just as soon as you answer my questions.<eos> And why would I do that?<eos> Because your name is at the top of the list, and I'm guessing you know what that means.<eos> Yeah, I'm the scapegoat.<eos> But it also means anything they get, they know it came from me.<eos> Except you just told me to go to hell in front of all your buddies, and they saw you meant it.<eos> That's why you came to me at the prison.<eos> Now you got cover.<eos> And I suggest you use it.
A celebrated surgeon, a knife of the night.<eos> A true pioneer.<eos> So, without further ornaments, or adornments on my part, let me now finally, and without any further hesitation or reservation, introduce you to Mr Robert Lessing!<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> I'm always astonished that my humble skills can bring in such a large and distinguished crowd.<eos> Hello, Sally, you in again?<eos> The sad fact is that 40% of the operations that happen in this room do unfortunately end in death.<eos> If that is something you're unable to contend with, gentlemen, ladies, please, I suggest you leave the theatre now.<eos> Thank you, Peters.<eos> Let me introduce you to our patient today.
- Mm-hmm.<eos> - A cool mind. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - The steadiest hand.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Can you remove it?<eos> I can.<eos> The challenge is that during the operation, there will be considerable haemorrhaging that will block your airways preventing you from being able to breathe.<eos> That will be the real threat to your life.<eos> So, the procedure that I propose is a tracheotomy.<eos> I can puncture a hole in your throat, your Grace, and the placement of a simple tube... will enable you to breathe during the operation.
We need to reclaim the skill.<eos> The great American president George Washington died on the table because his surgeons feared performing a tracheotomy.<eos> I don't fear it.<eos> Had I been there, the president would have lived.<eos> And so will you, your Grace.<eos> - Will this operation be a first?<eos> - I believe so.<eos> We know of some French surgeons that have contemplated a combined tumour removal and tracheotomy but so far none have yet dared attempt it.<eos> Then we must beat the French to it, sir.<eos> I offer you my face.
I already told you everything I know. Not everything.<eos> It's time you gave us the name of your source.<eos> The deal is that money goes into my daughter's account, then you get the name.<eos> - What the hell is this?<eos> - It's a down payment.<eos> Down payment?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> - I want the whole thing.<eos> - And if you think we're giving you half a million without a name, then you're out of your mind.<eos> Then we are at what they call an impasse, because I'm not giving you that name without that money.
It looks like you just wrote that today. - What makes you say that?<eos> - It has today's date on top.<eos> I just wrote that down to remember today's conversation.<eos> Can I go back to work now?<eos> Yep, just make sure you have the affidavit on my desk as soon as possible.<eos> Thanks for seeing us on such short notice, Ms. Randolph.<eos> I have to say, when I heard the name Frank Gallo, my interest was piqued.<eos> What's this about?<eos> We're representing a class of prisoners suing Reform Corporation for abusive practices.<eos> We're here to confirm that Frank Gallo came to see you seven years ago and admitted to being involved in a conspiracy.
- You don't know where, or you don't know what case he's working on?<eos> I don't know either one, but if you calm down, then maybe I can help you find him.<eos> No, Rachel, I don't want help finding him.<eos> In fact, I don't want you telling him I was looking for him at all.<eos> - Oscar Reyes?<eos> - Yes. My name is Harvey Specter.<eos> It's come to my attention that you're filing a class-action lawsuit.<eos> We are. How can I help you?<eos> Our pro bono work means a lot to us.<eos> We take it very seriously, and I have a very difficult question to ask you.
You know, you get all of that adrenaline going, and, you know, you see things that aren't there.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> What are you remembering?<eos> Tell me.<eos> It looked like he recognized her.<eos> When he saw who it was, he let her go.<eos> You think he knew her?<eos> And then he let her kill him?<eos> Mrs. Tannetti, you're charged in the complaint with a felony violation of section 125.27 of the New York State Penal Code, in which it's alleged that you committed a second degree murder in the death of Frankie Belmont.<eos> Having in mind the rights which were just read to you, will you be entering a plea?
Let's go.<eos> Okay.<eos> Have you ever been diagnosed with any mental health issues?<eos> No, never.<eos> Are you taking any medication for any mental disorders?<eos> No, because I don't have any mental disorders.<eos> Can you define what it means to be found guilty?<eos> Have you ever tried to harm yourself?<eos> Sometimes I used to imagine what it would be like, as a kid.<eos> When you picture yourself as a kid, how old are you?
Man, Faye would love it.<eos> It's worth the drive.<eos> You should try it. Didn't you drive an hour once to try an artisanal doughnut? - Man...<eos> - Wasn't that you?<eos> I'm not talking about doughnuts.<eos> - I'm talking about...<eos> - Hey. 730 results on Cora Tannetti.<eos> She passed because, technically, she should pass.<eos> She's lucid. She's aware of her circumstances. Her judgment isn't compromised.<eos> What would you say if I told you... that I think there was a song that was playing on the beach and it drove her to kill Belmont and the same song drove her to attack me?
So it didn't really matter who.<eos> Please don't tell my family.<eos> Mason thinks that this is, um, from a hospital infection that I got when I was young.<eos> His parents don't know.<eos> They will tell my son.<eos> I can't promise that.<eos> - It's my job.<eos> - Please.<eos> I can't.<eos> I have told you everything else.
Mason Tannetti... did he get her into this?<eos> No. I mean, honestly, he was kind of a dick in high school, but... he was never a junkie.<eos> Yeah, I gotta take this.<eos> Detective Ambrose.<eos> Hey, Harry.<eos> It's Walt over at county.<eos> You wanted to know when Cora Tannetti had any visitors?<eos> Well, she had a new one this afternoon.<eos> Good afternoon, Ms. Lacey.<eos> You have a visitor.
Amen.<eos> The blood of Christ.<eos> You have to touch it.<eos> I love you, Jesus.<eos> I love you, Jesus.<eos> And, in pursuant to Code 730, the defendant has been found fit to stand at this allocution.<eos> So, Mrs. Tannetti, are you entering your plea after full consultation with your attorney?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Do you clearly understand the nature of second-degree murder charges and that if you plead guilty, you are, from this point forward, waiving your right to a trial?<eos> - Do you realize, in light of a guilty plea, you'll be sentenced in two weeks' time, with no right to appeal?
I mean, I don't really know what to say to her, to be honest.<eos> 'Cause it didn't really make any sense.<eos> She started going towards the girlfriend.<eos> Like she was saving her.<eos> Get down.<eos> When you were a baby inside of me, you took up all my strength.<eos> That's why she's so sick.<eos> You think he knew her?<eos> And then he let her kill him?<eos> Having in mind the rights which were just read to you, will you be entering a plea?
And we got a case.<eos> Well, yeah, but if we go to trial, we have to establish motive.<eos> And so far...<eos> There's an explanation there somewhere.<eos> I didn't even notice her.<eos> None of us did.<eos> I remember I... I changed the music.<eos> Frankie was in a band when he was in med school, and I had the... the tracks on my phone to surprise him.<eos> We were just kidding around, and... next thing I know, she's there, screaming.<eos> Did Cora say anything during any of this to you, or anybody else?

Don't screw around with me.<eos> Why did you kill him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do know.<eos> And I know that you know.<eos> You don't get to do what you did and not know.<eos> What happened on the beach?<eos> You were sitting there with your husband, and you were slicing up a pear for your son, and Frankie and his friends were 15 yards away, and somebody was playing music.<eos> And you heard that music, didn't you?<eos> It reminded you of something, didn't it?
No, I'm merely talking to you.<eos> Anyone can see that we are not responsible for what befalls Gresit.<eos> No, keep walking.<eos> So, now I'm stupid?<eos> I work within the light of God Himself, but you can see things I can't with your magic?<eos> There's no magic, sir.<eos> We are here to help, that's all.<eos> Speakers don't help.<eos> Speakers are tainted.<eos> You attract evil, and you and yours were told to be out of Gresit by sunset.
No caravans.<eos> But I would be glad of your company on the way to our lodging.<eos> How many are you?<eos> Eleven, though I insist we be counted as 12.<eos> One of us is missing, you see.<eos> This is where we live.<eos> Please, come inside.<eos> Meet my people.<eos> Elder, we were worried about you.<eos> I told you it was too soon to go outdoors.
You're leaving right now.<eos> Where are the Speakers?<eos> I've put them somewhere safe.<eos> I swear it just moved.<eos> You defend evil.<eos> Give them to us!<eos> Shut up.<eos> What?<eos> Shut up.<eos> You're not getting the Speakers.
I promise you your mom did not pack you a poop sandwich.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Oh, hi.<eos> Oh, are you Elsie's mom?<eos> I am, I'm Alison, it's so nice to meet you.<eos> Oh, nice to meet you, I'm Andrea, I'm Amelia's mom.<eos> - Welcome to the school.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Oh, my gosh, she is so cute.<eos> Listen, if you need anything, do not hesitate to reach out.
Oh, are you Elsie's mom?<eos> I am, I'm Alison, it's so nice to meet you.<eos> Oh, nice to meet you, I'm Andrea, I'm Amelia's mom.<eos> - Welcome to the school.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Oh, my gosh, she is so cute.<eos> Listen, if you need anything, do not hesitate to reach out.<eos> I know Elsie would love to have a play date with Amelia.<eos> Amelia would love that.<eos> What's good for you guys?
"Here we go"?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Excuse me, do you know where the bathroom is?<eos> Is that woman just ignoring that poor blind guy?<eos> People are garbage.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> She's a garbage person.<eos> I don't know if you heard me, I'm looking for the bathroom.<eos> Hi, you know what?<eos> - I can help you.
You're the only person who I know is not Tilda Swinton.<eos> - How dare you.<eos> - She could be Amelia, she's so good.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah. Tilda Swinton maybe came out of my vagines?<eos> Um... is my dad touching our mother right now?<eos> Technically, when one body part presses up against another body part, that is considered touching.<eos> Is it that hard to just say yes or no? Are they touching?<eos> Yes.<eos> Oh, sure, hey, you want to sit here?
And, last but not least, keys to your new apartment.<eos> I got you a corner.<eos> You have the address, correct?<eos> Yeah. Yes.<eos> Okay, and you saw the doctor yesterday?<eos> For the tracer, you mean?<eos> It's for your own protection.<eos> There's dozens of kidnappings every year here in Colombia, usually from companies like ours.<eos> But, with that sucker, they can locate you anywhere, anytime, no problem.<eos> Bogotá treating you good so far?
You have any idea why they would be heading into that old hangar next door?<eos> I don't know, man. I'll check it out.<eos> All employees, no matter what you're doing, please stop and lend me your full attention.<eos> Hey, it's Jesus!<eos> There are currently 80 of you in the building.<eos> What is that?<eos> Intercom?<eos> Do we have an intercom?<eos> In eight hours, most of you will be dead.<eos> Your chance of survival increases by following my orders, and excelling at the tasks I place before you.
I don't know.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Mike.<eos> Mike, open the door!<eos> Mike!<eos> Mike!<eos> Michael Milch, set down the knife immediately, or we will detonate the explosive.<eos> Mike!<eos> Mike, please!<eos> Mr. Milch, we will give you 10 seconds to cease and desist.
They're trying to break us down so that we start killing each other, Bud.<eos> You just need to relax, all right? Hmm?<eos> I hope by now we've demonstrated that we aren't blindly bluffing.<eos> This game's a real one.<eos> Each of you are deep inside it.<eos> You can choose to follow our directives, or not.<eos> Either way, you'll be giving us the results we're looking for.<eos> Fuck you, man!<eos> You are mostly free to do as you please.<eos> However, you must not dismantle any more cameras.
Dad, you're a genius.<eos> Where's he gone now?<eos> You're right, I'm never gonna go to the Olympics.<eos> I'm gonna go to the Winter Olympics.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you... the Head of the British Winter Olympics Selection Committee, Mr. Dustin Target.<eos> Thank you, George.<eos> Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> Thank you so much for being here... on this glorious day for British sport.<eos> You have entered a new era for business... just as we have embarked on a new era for sport.<eos> Today it is my honor... and privilege, to present to you... the 14 young men who are all candidates for the British Olympic Downhill Team.
My dad would like that.<eos> Peary, this has got the Olympic rings on.<eos> Well, it won't open itself, man.<eos> "We request the pleasure of your company at the British Olympic Headquarters."<eos> My work is done, man.<eos> You're on your way.<eos> "Fast" Eddie Edwards.<eos> - Mr. Edwards.<eos> - Mr. Target.<eos> I just wanted to say to you and to all of you... what an honor this is and... I promise not to let you or the Olympic Team down.
And you were landing on your head.<eos> Look at the progress we've made.<eos> Exactly!<eos> This is my moment!<eos> Don't make this your moment, please!<eos> They'll make you a fool.<eos> Well, I'd rather be a sober fool than a drunken coward!<eos> Any pinching under the arms, sir?<eos> Maybe you were right, we should have gone for 71 meters.<eos> Yes, maybe you should have.
- That's very important.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Don't be nervous.<eos> Just be yourself and try and enjoy it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Control yourselves, people.<eos> Everybody sit down.<eos> One at a time.<eos> Sit down.<eos> I'd like to introduce you to Eddie Edwards, sometimes known as Eddie "The Eagle."
I'll fetch it for you.<eos> Uh-- he's all cool now.<eos> Probably gonna sleep a while.<eos> He better?<eos> He's fine.<eos> That's my boy.<eos> That's my boy.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, don't have to thank me.<eos> I got loaned to you.
Fight. Fight.<eos> Fight. But you got a "g" right there.<eos> Mm-hmm. But it's a silent "g" again.<eos> The "gh" is always silent, like "light," "right." Right. Right.<eos> What a man grows with his own two hands ought to belong to him, yeah?<eos> How's that scripture go, Jasper?<eos> This here's from the book of galatians.<eos> "Be not deceived.<eos> God is not mocked, for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."<eos> What you sow you should reap. What you put in the ground, you should take out of the ground.
What do you say we go out there and we pick it clean?<eos> There's 100 of us.<eos> We pick it clean in one day.<eos> We do that?<eos> Yeah!<eos> We pick it clean, hide it away.<eos> We divide it amongst ourselves later on.<eos> Meanwhile, by the time they get down here, we done scattered.<eos> Yeah!<eos> - How's that sound to you?
What is a lawful apprenticeship, lieutenant?<eos> To quote the statute on apprenticeship...<eos> "If any apprentice shall leave the employment of his or her master without consent, said master may pursue and recapture the apprentice and bring him before any justice of the peace, whose duty it shall be to remand said apprentice to the service of his or her masters."<eos> -You done yet?<eos> -You, sir, are out of order.<eos> No, I'm not out of order, lieutenant.<eos> I understand this quite clearly.<eos> Y'all get your land back.<eos> Then you go and work up some fancy law just last week that gets this boy back in the fields picking cotton for you.<eos> Mr. knight, you're gonna get your chance to talk.
I don't want him to drop his eyes every time a white man walk by.<eos> I don't want him to be a "boy" no more once he turn into a man.<eos> Don't you want that too?<eos> Course I do.<eos> We got to go up north.<eos> It ain't your fault we lost that war.<eos> I know you tried to win it all by yourself.<eos> This is our home.<eos> It's our home.<eos> We would like to offer you a proposal, Mr. knight.
While there had been some inclement weather in the region, the problem seems linked to what authorities are calling a catastrophic power surge that has crippled traffic in the area.<eos> Okay. Okay, please.<eos> Please.<eos> Please don't hurt me.<eos> Please.<eos> Just let me go, okay? I won't tell anybody.<eos> I promise, okay?<eos> Please just let me go.<eos> Please.<eos> You need fluids.
Please don't hurt me.<eos> Please.<eos> Just let me go, okay? I won't tell anybody.<eos> I promise, okay?<eos> Please just let me go.<eos> Please.<eos> You need fluids.<eos> You were in shock.<eos> What are you going to do to me?<eos> I'm going to keep you alive.
What are you going to do to me?<eos> I'm going to keep you alive.<eos> Work on getting handy with these.<eos> My boyfriend was expecting me.<eos> He'll send the cops looking.<eos> I'm sorry. But no one is looking for you.<eos> You've got some fight in you.<eos> I can respect that.<eos> But don't even think about trying that again.<eos> You're lucky to be here at all.
And my generosity only extends so far.<eos> Eggs.<eos> Toradol to help with your pain.<eos> Please.<eos> Please, just let me go.<eos> Please.<eos> There is nowhere to go, Michelle.<eos> I looked through your wallet.<eos> Given as how I saved your life, I think that's acceptable.<eos> You're lucky to be here at all.
Michelle, they're not okay.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Everyone outside of here is dead.<eos> But what about you?<eos> Don't you have a family?<eos> Who's that?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> What did you do?<eos> You know what, Michelle?<eos> I'm gonna tell you what I told him.
How do you know that?<eos> Everyone outside of here is dead.<eos> But what about you?<eos> Don't you have a family?<eos> Who's that?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> What did you do?<eos> You know what, Michelle?<eos> I'm gonna tell you what I told him.<eos> You need to eat, you need to sleep, and you need to start showing me a little bit of appreciation.
What you heard earlier, was him knocking over a shelf with a whole week's worth of food, which he's sorry for, correct?<eos> Totally.<eos> Let's go.<eos> This is the common area.<eos> Good for r r.<eos> As you can see, I've planned for a long stay.<eos> The Aquaponics system cleans the air and keeps it fresh.<eos> This is the living room.<eos> Help yourself to any reading.<eos> If you like to watch films, I have some on DVD and VHS cassette.
I mean, it's amazing.<eos> You people...<eos> You wear helmets when you ride your bikes. You have seat belts in your cars. You have alarm systems to protect your homes.<eos> But what do you do when those alarms go off?<eos> "Crazy" is building your ark after the flood has already come!<eos> I think maybe it's time you met frank and Mildred.<eos> Closest I could get to an airlock.<eos> See?<eos> What happened to them?<eos> They weren't as lucky as you.
What happened to them?<eos> They weren't as lucky as you.<eos> It's the air, Michelle.<eos> That's what happens when you get exposed.<eos> I keep this door sealed at all times.<eos> No one comes in or out.<eos> Met frank and Mildred, huh?<eos> It's funny, right?<eos> The whole world ends and the thing he's most upset about is a pair of dead pigs?<eos> You in need of some reading material?
How do you know that?<eos> Because I told him.<eos> Dinner's ready.<eos> I see you two are getting along.<eos> How's that sauce?<eos> It's fine.<eos> As cooks go, I'm okay.<eos> Not great, but okay.<eos> Megan was a good cook.<eos> You'll learn to love cooking.
And I was.<eos> And here we are.<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> Is that monopoly?<eos> There we go!<eos> Yeah, that's how we kill the time.<eos> What would you say, Howard, we're gonna be down here, what, like, a year? Two? Maybe?<eos> I bet you if we started a game right now, we might even get halfway finished by the time...<eos> Stop talking!<eos> You don't need to make jokes about how long we're going to be down here when nobody knows how long that's going to be.
Master Kaecilius.<eos> That ritual will bring you only sorrow.
Hey.<eos> Organ harvest.<eos> He's a donor.<eos> Slow down.<eos> I did not agree to that.<eos> I don't need you to.<eos> We've already called brain death.<eos> Prematurely.<eos> We need to get him prepped for sub-occipital craniotomy.<eos> Not gonna let you operate on a dead man.
It's all I have left.<eos> Your watch.<eos> All right.<eos> You're looking for kamar-taj.<eos> Really?<eos> Sure we got the right place?<eos> That one looks a little more kamar-tajey.<eos> I once stood in your place.<eos> And I, too, was disrespectful.<eos> So, might I offer you some advice?
Ancient one, for seeing me.<eos> You're very welcome.<eos> The ancient one.<eos> Thank you, master Mordo.<eos> Thank you, master Hamir.<eos> Mr. Strange.<eos> Doctor, actually.<eos> No, not anymore, surely.<eos> Isn't that why you're here?<eos> You've undergone many procedures.
How did you correct a complete c7-c8 spinal cord injury?<eos> I didn't correct it.<eos> He couldn't walk.<eos> I convinced him that he could.<eos> You're not suggesting it was psychosomatic?<eos> When you reattach a severed nerve... Is it you who heals it back together or the body?<eos> It's the cells.<eos> The cells are only programmed... To put themselves back together in very specific ways.<eos> Right.<eos> What if I told you that your own body could be convinced... To put itself back together in all sorts of ways?
And what about this one?<eos> - Acupuncture, great. - Yeah?<eos> What about that one?<eos> Showing me an MRI scan.<eos> I do not believe this.<eos> Each of those maps was drawn up by someone... Who could see in part, but not the whole.<eos> I spent my last dollar getting here, one-way ticket... And you're talking to me about healing through belief?<eos> You're a man looking at the world through a keyhole.<eos> You've spent your whole life trying to widen that keyhole... To see more, to know more.<eos> Now, on hearing that it can be widened... In ways you can't imagine... You reject the possibility.
What's in that tea?<eos> Psilocybin?<eos> LSD?<eos> It's just tea... With a little honey.<eos> What just happened?<eos> For a moment, you entered the astral dimension.<eos> The what?<eos> A place where the soul exists apart from the body.<eos> Why are you doing this to me?<eos> To show you just how much you don't know.
No!<eos> Open the door!<eos> Please!<eos> Thank you, masters.<eos> You think I was wrong to cast him out?<eos> 5 hours later, he's still on your doorstep.<eos> There's a strength to him.<eos> Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition.<eos> I've seen it all before.<eos> He reminds you of Kaecilius?
Come on, just give me the book.<eos> No.<eos> Once, in this room, you begged me to let you learn.<eos> Now, I'm told you question every lesson... Preferring to teach yourself.<eos> Once, in this room, you told me to open my eye.<eos> Now, I'm being told to blindly accept rules... That make no sense.<eos> Like the rule against conjuring a gateway in the library?<eos> Wong told on me?<eos> You're advancing quickly with your sorcery skills.<eos> You need a safe space to practice your spells.
You need a safe space to practice your spells.<eos> You are now inside the mirror dimension... Ever present but undetected.<eos> The real world isn't affected by what happens here.<eos> We use the mirror dimension to train, surveil... And sometimes to contain threats.<eos> You don't wanna be stuck in here without your sling ring.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Sorry.<eos> What do you mean, "threats?"<eos> Learning of an infinite multiverse includes learning of infinite dangers.<eos> If I told you everything else that you don't already know... You'd run from here in terror.
Doctor.<eos> Mister doctor?<eos> It's Strange.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Who am I to judge?<eos> You don't know how to use that, do you?<eos> What?<eos> Stop it.<eos> I said stop it.<eos> You cannot stop this, mister doctor.
Our universe grows cold and perishes.<eos> But the dark dimension... It's a place beyond time.<eos> That's it.<eos> I'm putting this thing back on.<eos> This world doesn't have to die, doctor.<eos> This world can take its rightful place alongside so many others... As part of the one.<eos> The great and beautiful one.<eos> We can all live forever.<eos> Really?<eos> What do you have to gain out of this new age dimensional utopia?

He's the savior of worlds.<eos> No.<eos> I mean, come on.<eos> Look at your face.<eos> Dormammu made you a murderer.<eos> Just how good can his kingdom be?<eos> You think that's funny?<eos> No, not that.<eos> What's funny is that you've lost your sling ring.<eos> Sir, can I help you?
Don't tell me.<eos> Fine.<eos> Really do have to go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Strange!<eos> You're okay.<eos> A relative term.<eos> But yeah, I'm okay.<eos> The cloak of levitation.<eos> It came to you.
Not even dormammu?<eos> He offers immortality.<eos> It's our fear of death that gives dormammu life.<eos> He feeds off it.<eos> Like you feed off him?<eos> You talk to me about controlling death?<eos> I know how you do it.<eos> I've seen the missing rituals from the book of cagliostro.<eos> Measure your next words very carefully, doctor.<eos> Because you might not like them?
Because you may not know of what you speak.<eos> What is he talking about?<eos> I'm talking about her long life, the source of her immortality.<eos> She draws power from the dark dimension to stay alive.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I've seen the rituals.<eos> Worked them out.<eos> I know how you do it.<eos> Once they regroup... The zealots will be back.<eos> You'll need reinforcements.
What do you think I just did?<eos> You saved your own life!<eos> And then whined about it like a wounded dog.<eos> You would have done it so easily?<eos> You've no idea the things I've done.<eos> And the answer is yes.<eos> Without hesitation.<eos> Even if there's another way?<eos> There is no other way.<eos> You lack imagination.

You don't have time.<eos> Time is relative.<eos> Your body hasn't even hit the floor yet.<eos> I've spent so many years... Peering through time... Looking at this exact moment.<eos> But I can't see past it.<eos> I've prevented countless, terrible futures.<eos> And after each one, there's always another.<eos> And they all lead here... But never further.<eos> You think this is where you die.<eos> You wonder what I see in your future?
You think this is where you die.<eos> You wonder what I see in your future?<eos> No.<eos> Yes.<eos> I never saw your future.<eos> Only its possibilities.<eos> You have such a capacity for goodness.<eos> You always excelled... But not because you craved success... But because of your fear of failure.<eos> That's what made me a great doctor.<eos> It's precisely what kept you from greatness.

From learning the simplest and most significant lesson of all.
He uses magic to walk?<eos> Constantly.<eos> He had a choice...<eos> To return to his own life... Or to serve something greater than himself.<eos> So I could have my hands back again?<eos> My old life?<eos> You could.<eos> And the world would be all the lesser for it.<eos> I've hated drawing power from the dark dimension.<eos> But as you well know... Sometimes one must break the rules... In order to serve the greater good.
So why bring him here to New York?<eos> It's a bit of a long story.<eos> Family drama, that kind of thing.<eos> But we're looking for my father.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> So if you found Odin... You'd all return to Asgard promptly?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Promptly.<eos> Great!<eos> Allow me to help you.
Is that you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Welcome to Fazenda Jacobina.<eos> sir.<eos> Liaison to the governor general.<eos> No need to stand on ceremony.<eos> A simple handshake will suffice.<eos> This is Mr. Costin. but I have received a telegram from the border commission.<eos> Go on.<eos> They strongly advise you to... Abort the mission.
Go on.<eos> They strongly advise you to... Abort the mission.<eos> sir.<eos> They're already fighting...<eos> Where are the government offices?<eos> Sir?<eos> sir?<eos> I'm afraid you've left "government" behind a long time ago.<eos> you had better send them a telegram informing them that we will not stand down and we shall proceed as planned.<eos> How quickly can you find us an Indian guide?
Sir?<eos> sir?<eos> I'm afraid you've left "government" behind a long time ago.<eos> you had better send them a telegram informing them that we will not stand down and we shall proceed as planned.<eos> How quickly can you find us an Indian guide?<eos> I... but... what happened to him?<eos> was he afraid of a little hard work?<eos> sir.<eos> It's out of my hands now.<eos> You need to speak to baron De Gondoriz.
He can't be trusted.<eos> He needs a good beating every now and again.<eos> Por favor.<eos> are ya?<eos> Yes.<eos> For surveying.<eos> Well...<eos> Ain't nobody comes back from up there.<eos> Ever.<eos> Is this slave good enough for you?
- Please.<eos> Do not embarrass yourself.<eos> You come here to make maps.<eos> Why is that?<eos> So that there may be peace.<eos> What is peace?<eos> Peace means my business will flourish.<eos> I will flourish.<eos> Peace means only that nothing will change.<eos> I will help you because you will make sure that nothing will change.
please. hmm?<eos> It is one thing to defend the primitive jungle men.<eos> It is quite another to elevate their capacity beyond reason.<eos> no one here would dispute uh...<eos> Such a trip is very hard on the mind.<eos> Very hard indeed.<eos> Mr. Keltie...<eos> I think you should find my mind perfectly fit... thank heavens.<eos> gentlemen.<eos> I would like to introduce one of our brothers whose achievements are now known to you and not inconsiderable...
Give me strength to survive.<eos> He is not worthy.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> what is it?<eos> There are mining encampments south of us on the river.<eos> you will be on your way to them.<eos> I'm going to give you our last horse with what supplies I can spare and an Indian to guide you.<eos> I have a family at home.<eos> I cannot allow you to jeopardize the welfare of the entire crew.
I earnestly beseech you to come to an understanding.<eos> Very well.<eos> I most generously offer that if you are willing to apologize to me here I will consider withdrawing my claims against the RGs of course.<eos> major...<eos> Will you apologize? I am prepared to reconcile.<eos> Thank you. need to hear Mr. Murray's conditions.<eos> On the day that I agreed to join you on your mission your wife was present to witness your ascent.<eos> My only condition is that she again be present to witness your acknowledgment...<eos> Of the wrongs... That you have done to me.<eos> Sir? giving you far more than your share of our food.
Our readers have been asking where you've been since the war.<eos> I'm grateful for their interest.<eos> You may tell your readers I've recovered from my wounds and have been adapting to home life.<eos> Your pursuits in south America have led to a tremendous interest in exploration in the United States.<eos> There have been many new voyages planned.<eos> - Have there?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Dr. Hamilton rice leaves for Brazil soon with radio and airplanes.<eos> He's taking a large and very well armed party. does not destroy what he wishes to discover.<eos> Allow me to ask you a question.

Tribesmen shall take our dispatches to be delivered for publication as often as possible.<eos> But who's going to finance this latest journey of yours?<eos> The money is generously being supplied by a consortium of American newspapers Jr.<eos> Are you aware the royal geographical society has just offered to help with the financing?<eos> I am glad to see our nation is not to be left behind.<eos> I would like now to introduce my companion for this historic expedition...<eos> Mr. Jack Fawcett.<eos> He is a man of great discipline and keen as mustard.<eos> we couldn't very well be shamed could we?<eos> but I am proud to say that we did finally manage to meet them halfway. always bore you great affection.
Mr. Jack Fawcett.<eos> He is a man of great discipline and keen as mustard.<eos> we couldn't very well be shamed could we?<eos> but I am proud to say that we did finally manage to meet them halfway. always bore you great affection.<eos> But I admit my error in not accepting your beliefs long ago.<eos> No.<eos> All that matters now is the future.<eos> Yes.<eos> I have carried this for the last 20 years.<eos> I shall send it to you as a sign...
I fear we have to accept the inevitable.<eos> I confess that the brutal wear and tear is great.<eos> And I suffer with heart and soul.<eos> It has taken...<eos> All my strength of will but I beg you...<eos> Not to lose confidence.<eos> I cannot doubt...<eos> After so many years of sacrifice.<eos> It has become my own life's work.<eos> The Brazilian gave me this to give to you.
So, the Aldridge Mansion is the only 19th century home in New York City preserved both inside and out.<eos> At the time of its construction, it was one of the most elegant homes in existence, featuring every luxury, including a face bidet and an anti-Irish security fence.<eos> Over here, you can imagine Sir Aldridge entertaining his wealthy guests.<eos> It's said that, in this very room, P.T. Barnum first had the idea to enslave elephants.<eos> And if you'll follow me...<eos> Now, I'm gonna tell you something a little spooky.
I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, my class will be here any minute.<eos> You're Erin Gilbert, right?<eos> Co-author of Ghosts from Our Past:<eos> Both Literally and Figuratively:<eos> The Study of the Paranormal?<eos> No self-respecting scientist believes in the paranormal.<eos> I can assure you that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You're looking for a different Erin Gilbert.
Okay, somebody really doesn't want us getting in that door.<eos> Can you tell us what it's like to walk around in those shoes all day?<eos> -It's not fun.<eos> -All right.<eos> Holtzmann, check this out.<eos> Hold your ponies.<eos> All right. Good gag.<eos> Hey, are you getting that?<eos> Very funny.<eos> Is everything a joke to you guys?
Okay, we are on the cusp of something here, a real discovery.<eos> Unlike Columbia, this institute is 100% behind us.<eos> Really?<eos> Erin, this is what we have dreamed about since we were little kids.<eos> I know that if you come and join us here, they are gonna be so pumped.<eos> We just have to go upstairs and ask for more money.<eos> I just honestly didn't realize your department still existed.<eos> -What?<eos> -Come on, ghosts?<eos> I will not let the 12-year reputation of this fine institution be besmirched by you!
When the Fourth Cataclysm begins, laborers, such as yourself, will be among the last led to the butchery.<eos> So, make the most of your extra time.<eos> You are just a bundle of joy, ain't ya?<eos> You have a good day with your crazy ass.<eos> I wonder what train he taking.<eos> Is he going on the tracks?<eos> Man...<eos> You want to use the bathroom, there's a perfectly nice bathroom upstairs at Starbucks.<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> Hey, you're not supposed to be down here, man.
-We got tons of space.<eos> -Stripper pole!<eos> -The rent is $21,000 a month.<eos> -Burn in hell.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Wait, that's the monthly rent?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -Who can afford that?<eos> All your friend said was that you were looking for a place to explore the unknown.
Kevin dabbles in web design.<eos> And I asked him to throw together maybe a couple of logos for us.<eos> -You want to see them?<eos> -Now is your moment.<eos> Pull it out.<eos> Sure.<eos> You're like a lawsuit waiting to happen.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Okay, so...<eos> What do you think of that?
Come on!<eos> Am I on crack, or is that a good logo?<eos> Guys, I cannot do it by myself.<eos> This equipment is untested and highly unstable.<eos> All right, ladies, we got a limited window for when the next train arrives,<eos> I'm telling you.<eos> And don't touch the third rail unless y'all little dainty ass can handle 750 volts.<eos> -Come on.<eos> -You know what?<eos> I should've gave you some coveralls, man.
Me playing saxophone or me listening to saxophone?<eos> Who was on the phone?<eos> The Stonebrook Theatre.<eos> There's a goat on the loose.<eos> I'm gonna load up the car.<eos> Okay, okay, okay!<eos> Yo, yo, I got something for us, too!<eos> Hey, hey, hey, you guys, I got these from work.<eos> I'm making it official, man.<eos> You put one of these on, you won't get slimed again.
We're gonna lose it! Come on!<eos> -I love your fire!<eos> -Man.<eos> Upstairs!<eos> Go, go, go! Come on!<eos> Why fear what's around you?<eos> It could be everything you dreamed And it's about to be true<eos> Yeah<eos> Come with the one who wants to drag you away from the shore<eos> 'Cause you're looking for more
Come on.<eos> Excuse me, gotta get... Excuse me, excuse me.<eos> I got a ghost to get.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Did we just catch a ghost?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> We put a ghost in a box!<eos> You want some more, you want some more?<eos> Yes!<eos> What you're looking for You want some more...
Dr. Erin Gilbert.<eos> Is this a good time, Doctor, or is this dinner rush?<eos> Why don't you call and make an appointment?<eos> It's actually a perfect time.<eos> We were just doing some experiments over here.<eos> Yes, please, have a seat.<eos> Let's start light and easy.<eos> Why are you pretending to catch ghosts?<eos> You know, it's really easy to just sit there and be the naysayer, when you don't actually do anything.<eos> You know that we only comprehend about 4% of the universe.
We're testing the lab... In the...<eos> So, till we figure out how to best keep the entity, that's not gonna happen.<eos> How's that for my timing?<eos> I come.<eos> You've caught a ghost.<eos> I can't see it.<eos> Look, I know it probably sounds like we're making this up.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -It sounds crazy, and we probably don't really look like legitimate scientists.<eos> No, you only lack the proper equipment, like a garbage truck to hang on to the back of.
No, you only lack the proper equipment, like a garbage truck to hang on to the back of.<eos> Said the guy with the walking stick and the floppy hat.<eos> It was my mother's.<eos> Yeah, that is an awesome hat.<eos> All right, man. Thanks for stopping by.<eos> Well, I guess the graciousness has run out.<eos> You want to see it?<eos> I would love to see it.<eos> Well, he can't see it.<eos> I'm going to show it to you, then.
Sir, we don't have a lot of time.<eos> -And we're not frauds.<eos> -No.<eos> -We are legitimate scientists.<eos> -Let me interrupt you.<eos> We know you're not frauds, because we have been monitoring this situation quite closely.<eos> Agents Hawkins and Rorke are with Homeland Security.<eos> So we've been investigating this extremely quietly.<eos> -Okay.<eos> -So, what do you know?
It's strange.<eos> You know, his technology's not that different from ours.<eos> It's basically, like, we're both using the same science.<eos> -That is strange.<eos> -I think I know why.<eos> Look what Mr. Cuckoo Pants has been reading at the beach. No.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I told you that there would be people out there that loved our work.<eos> Why am I so flattered that that weird little sociopath bought our book?<eos> Thank you for everything you did.

No.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I told you that there would be people out there that loved our work.<eos> Why am I so flattered that that weird little sociopath bought our book?<eos> Thank you for everything you did.<eos> You saved us all.<eos> The mayor thanks you, of course.<eos> Privately, so don't tell anyone.<eos> Can I walk you out?<eos> Well, why don't you all go get some rest?
Wait, why?<eos> -Excuse me!<eos> -Stop resisting.<eos> I'm not. I'm walking with you.<eos> -Is New York in trouble?<eos> -Everything is fine.<eos> It was just another publicity stunt by these incredibly sad and lonely women.<eos> It's like they read Eat, Pray, Love and just ran with it.<eos> Did you guys lose your keys?<eos> What did I tell you? Pin it to your bra strap. That's where mine is, and it...
Holtzy! Got you, Holtzy!<eos> No!<eos> Get out of my friend, ghost!<eos> That's gonna leave a mark!<eos> The power of Patty compels you!<eos> Is that you, Abby?<eos> Where did he go?<eos> Hey, guys, check it out!<eos> Hey, listen.<eos> I figured you're gonna need my help, so I borrowed all this stuff.
I should have worked out more when I was alive.<eos> I definitely should have worked out more.<eos> You have to get out of the city!<eos> Please! Get out!<eos> No.<eos> It's happening.<eos> -Let's do this.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Taxi! Taxi!<eos> -Where you going?
What's he made out of?<eos> Pure muscle.<eos> And baby-soft skin.<eos> Come on, Rowan, show yourself!<eos> What form would you prefer I take?<eos> Maybe something stationary.<eos> Like a bull's-eye.<eos> Well, I'll tell you what I prefer.<eos> I prefer something nice and cute, like a friendly little ghost.<eos> Is this what you want?
Maybe something stationary.<eos> Like a bull's-eye.<eos> Well, I'll tell you what I prefer.<eos> I prefer something nice and cute, like a friendly little ghost.<eos> Is this what you want?<eos> Something more familiar?<eos> Ice cream.<eos> Well, you know what, I don't have no problem with that.<eos> Thank you very much for being reasonable.<eos> If this is what you want, it works for me.
Well, then, we're gonna have to start going to a different bar, girlfriend.<eos> No, you'll be fine, just don't hit your drink number with him.<eos> What's my drink number?<eos> In every male-female friendship, there's a total number of drinks and if you hit that, it means you will definitely have sex.<eos> So, how many drinks does it take to get you wasted?<eos> Two and a half<eos> - but maybe three, if I've eaten.<eos> - Three.<eos> Okay, and Tom's is eight.<eos> So, you can't hit eleven drinks between the two of you.
Just...<eos> Uh, merry Christmas.<eos> "'We're safe!<eos> ' said Paul, as they ran from the dragon."<eos> Um, who's Paul?<eos> Sorry, "the Prince."<eos> "Then, he leaned in to kiss her, and finally said..."<eos> Oh, that's rich.<eos> How does the story end?<eos> I'll tell you how it ends.
Selfie time!<eos> Selfie time. One, two...<eos> No, I can take one of you guys.<eos> Three!<eos> You're better than her.<eos> Wow.<eos> What?<eos> - What?<eos> - Mom!<eos> You need to go inside.
Ah... the sleeping girl.<eos> You know, I'm not saying the universe is evil... but it sure has a nasty sense of humor.<eos> How is that?<eos> You get to fly to another planet... but you'll die along the way.<eos> And you find the perfect woman... right in front of you... yet she's completely out of reach.<eos> Yeah, I'll miss New York City.<eos> Give me a cup of coffee and a view of the Chrysler building... and I can write all day.<eos> They do have coffee on Homestead II, right?<eos> They better have coffee. If they don't, I have to turn around and come back to Earth.<eos> Is there anything you regret leaving behind?
I don't know.<eos> I've never been on an island.<eos> Okay, well, yeah.<eos> Uh... forget the island.<eos> Let's say you figured out how to do something... that would make your life a million times better... but you knew it was wrong and there's no taking it back.<eos> How do you do the math?<eos> Jim, these are not robot questions.<eos> I know how to wake Aurora up. Oh.<eos> Well, that seems like a fine idea.<eos> You could use some company.
She is wonderful.<eos> Excellent choice.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Is he asking me on a date?<eos> Do you need a pen?<eos> She didn't seem that impressed.<eos> "Love to." She wrote, "Love to."<eos> You have a visitor.
Good.<eos> I wrote a few pages.<eos> Did you find anything that can help us?<eos> I did.<eos> Are they real?<eos> I cut them myself.<eos> Oh, wow!<eos> You know, for two unlucky people... we sure got pretty lucky.<eos> Attention.<eos> You may wish to proceed to a viewing area.
Last week, my door broke.<eos> I was trapped in my cabin for two days.<eos> You were?<eos> Things like that don't happen. Not on this ship.<eos> There are sixteen of these tech stations, on every deck.<eos> Dock your slate. Data syncs automatically.<eos> Got it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> You take decks one and two. You take decks three and four.
You'd do what you set out to do.<eos> You'd be alone.<eos> I've been alone before... and I'll be fine.<eos> But I would never see you again.<eos> I'll come and visit you.<eos> Tuesday is my day with Arthur.<eos> Lovely as ever.<eos> Thank you, Arthur.<eos> You're looking very well yourself.<eos> Thanks to you.
All right.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.<eos> I know you do bad things.<eos> Don't worry, I still love you.<eos> Welcome to Belle Reve, special security barracks.<eos> How you doing, man?<eos> Why don't you kiss her ass? She's in charge.<eos> Welcome, ma'am.<eos> How are you?<eos> I'm here to assist you in any way.
You're in no position to make any demands. Oh.<eos> You thought I was talking to you.<eos> No, errand boy.<eos> I'm talking to your boss.<eos> That's my price, sweetie.<eos> You know what it is.<eos> You notice these are criminals, hmm?<eos> They're psychotic, antisocial freaks.<eos> It makes no sense.<eos> Let me hit the Tier One units and I'll build you a team of pipe hitters who'll do anything you can dream up.

Not these scumbags.
Ops just confirmed.<eos> She's down. 1 k west.<eos> Let's go get her.<eos> The mission's not over.<eos> Nah. It is for me.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> Without Waller, you got nothing.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> I'm back!<eos> I missed you all so much.
We're in position.<eos> We gotta get him in that corner.<eos> That's where the bomb will be.<eos> I'll do it!<eos> I'll get him there.<eos> I lost one family.<eos> I ain't gonna lose another one.<eos> Look, think it through.<eos> I got this.<eos> Let me show you what I really am.
Please, I'm begging you, seriously.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Have you got a car?<eos> Because I'm a brilliant driver.<eos> Come on!<eos> Puddin'!<eos> Let's go home.<eos> This is crown jewels here, Mr. Wayne.<eos> And you do understand my legal exposure.<eos> If anyone knew what I procured for you...

-Like two hobos fucking in a shoe filled with piss.<eos> -Okay, enough.<eos> I can go all day, Dopinder.<eos> The point is, it's bad!<eos> It's bad.<eos> Why the fancy red suit, Mr. Pool?<eos> That's because it's Christmas Day, Dopinder.<eos> And I'm after someone on my naughty list.<eos> I've been waiting one year, three weeks... six days and... 14 minutes to make him fix what he did to me.<eos> And what did he do to you, Mr. Pool?

I got this.<eos> 9, 10, 11, 12 bullets, or bust.<eos> Right here!<eos> That's $27.50.<eos> I never carry a wallet when I'm working.<eos> Ruins the lines of my suit.<eos> But, how about a crisp high five?<eos> Okay.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> And a convivial Tuesday in April to you too, Pool!

Deadpool may try to break yours.<eos> Get out of the way!<eos> Hey!<eos> Wait!<eos> You may be wondering, "Why the red suit?"<eos> Well, that's so bad guys can't see me bleed.<eos> This guy's got the right idea.<eos> He wore the brown pants.<eos> Fine!<eos> I only have 12 bullets... so you're gonna have to share!
Boothe.<eos> Wade.<eos> Mr. Wilson.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Besides luring children into a panel van.<eos> I understand you've recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer.<eos> Stalker alert.<eos> It's my job.<eos> Recruitment.<eos> I'm sorry you've had such a tough go.
One every seven weeks.<eos> Same rate most folks get a haircut.<eos> It's to wash the taste out.<eos> It's tough to forget being so impressive.<eos> And now you spend your days sticking up for the little people...<eos> People change.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I represent an organization that may be able to help.<eos> What if I told you we can cure your cancer?<eos> And what's more, give you abilities most men only dream of?
Are You There God?<eos> It's Me, Margaret.<eos> Rock, meet bottom.<eos> And when life ends up breathtakingly fucked... you can generally trace it back to one big, bad decision.<eos> The one that sent you down the road to Shitsburgh.<eos> This?<eos> Well, this was mine.<eos> Mr. Wilson.<eos> Nothing warms my heart more than a change of someone else's.<eos> You finally hit "fuck it."
Mr. Wilson, my name's Ajax.<eos> I manage this workshop.<eos> My welcome speech used to be full of euphemisms like...<eos> "This may hurt a little." "This may cause you some discomfort."<eos> But I've grown blunt.<eos> This workshop is not a government-led program.<eos> It's a private institution that turns reclamation projects like yourself... into men of extraordinary abilities.<eos> But if you think superhuman powers are acquired painlessly...<eos> Wrong.<eos> I'm injecting you with a serum that activates any mutant genes lurking in your DNA.
About to be 90.<eos> Mr. Wilson?<eos> You're looking very alive.<eos> Only on the outside.<eos> -This is not going to end well for me, is it?<eos> -This is not gonna end well for you, no.<eos> Where's your boss?<eos> I can tell you exactly...<eos> Oh, you'll tell me, but first...<eos> You might wanna look away for this.
Whoops!<eos> You weren't meant to see that.<eos> There.<eos> All caught up.<eos> We're here.<eos> Sorry about bleeding in all your garbage.<eos> Seltzer water and lemon for blood.<eos> Some kinds of anger can't be managed... like the kind where your year-long plan ends with the wrong guy getting dismembered!<eos> That said, when it comes time to licking wounds, there's no place like home.<eos> And I share that home with someone you've met, the old blind lady from the laundromat, Al.
Think Ryan Reynolds got this far on his superior acting method?<eos> Love is blind, Wade.<eos> No.<eos> You're blind.<eos> So, you're just gonna lie there and whimper?<eos> No, I'm gonna wait till this arm plows through puberty... and then I'm gonna come up with a whole new Christmas Day plan.<eos> In the meantime, you might wanna leave the room.<eos> I bet it feels huge in this hand.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> So, the doctor says, "The bad news is you don't have that long to live."
Look away!<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait!<eos> Cease fire!<eos> Cease fire!<eos> Fellas!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> You only work for that shit-spackled muppet fart.<eos> So, I'mma give you a chance for y'all to lay down your firearms... in exchange for preferential, bordering on gentle... possibly even lover-like treatment.
It's over.<eos> Go home.<eos> You're expecting a teaser for Deadpool 2.<eos> Well, we don't have that kind of money.<eos> What are you expecting?<eos> Sam Jackson to show up?<eos> With an eye patch and a saucy little leather number?<eos> Go.<eos> Go.<eos> But I can tell you one thing, and it's a bit of a secret.
Maybe that's the reason Mark Darcy and I never made it.<eos> I always felt like a verbally incontinent old maid even when we were together.<eos> Still, I wasn't going to dwell on the negatives.<eos> At least no one at work knew it was my birthday.<eos> Or, indeed, how old I was going to be.<eos> Surprise!<eos> Happy birthday, Bridget!<eos> Gosh!<eos> Or so I thought.<eos> Who told you?
What you need is a good shafting.<eos> You need some good old-fashioned, lie-back-and-think-of-England bonking.<eos> And festivals are sexual free-for-alls.<eos> Like Sodom and Gomorrah, with tofu.<eos> First man you meet, you gotta sleep with.<eos> First man?<eos> I'm not taking no for an answer.<eos> I'm gonna find our backstage passes.<eos> You get the maps.<eos> Wanna know where you are?
Excuse me?<eos> Do you mind if we ask you to take a photo of us?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> Thank you.<eos> All right.<eos> You ready?<eos> Hey, what are you doing?<eos> I was taking a photo.<eos> I thought you guys wanted a photo.
What about the first scan?<eos> Would that show when conception took place?<eos> No.<eos> Ring this number to fix a date.<eos> And do bring along the father if you can work out which one he is.<eos> Right.<eos> Right.<eos> Just out of interest... Mmm? If someone did have an element of confusion about the father...<eos> Well, you can get a DNA sample at the amniocentesis.<eos> And I do recommend that you have the amniocentesis because there are always more risks with a geriatric mother.
Okay.<eos> All gone.<eos> Yeah, that's lovely.<eos> These fingernails on this silver fox could do with a bit of a trim, couldn't they?<eos> These hands haven't experienced much manual labor, have they?<eos> No.<eos> I'm a mathematician.<eos> They're silky soft.<eos> Tell me, Jack.<eos> Do you happen to like Chinese food?
Can you tell me what she's doing?<eos> Ask him something about algorithms.<eos> This has to be the last question. Has to be.<eos> Lastly, algorithms.<eos> Yes.<eos> What first attracted you to them?<eos> The logic, and...<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Jack Quant, thank you for coming on my sofa.<eos> I hope you've had as much fun as I have.
Hi.<eos> You're the best thing I've ever seen.<eos> I promise I'll try my best.<eos> So, you just stay safe and snug in there while I try and sort the mess out here.<eos> And hopefully...<eos> What the fuck is that?<eos> Um, it's the amniocentesis needle.<eos> We just pop it in, take a little amniotic fluid, test it for any abnormalities, and also the DNA sample that you require.<eos> Now, there is the slightest risk of miscarriage.<eos> So, you'll have to stay very still indeed because we don't want the needle to come into contact...
Just tell the truth, Bridget.<eos> Can't go too far wrong telling the truth.<eos> "Mark, I have some exciting news."<eos> "Mark, I have the funniest story to tell you."<eos> "Mark, I'm up the duff."<eos> My Lords, my Ladies.<eos> There is only one fraud committed here today and it is this.<eos> To use the laws of one country to destroy the freedom of speech of another.<eos> A cynical political expedient to take away the right of these brave young women to speak the truth about the country they love.<eos> Now you may not like their music.
My boy.<eos> Okay.<eos> Right.<eos> This time, I have to tell them.<eos> Will start with Jack.<eos> Have invited him to big scary work presentation.<eos> And will explain all afterwards.<eos> Welcome.<eos> In a digital age where every cell phone is a camera, we are all broadcasters.<eos> Hard News is partnering with the London Media Show so that you will be able to use your smartphones to create your own news broadcasting channels!
We met fleetingly before as well.<eos> I'm in charge of data management for most of Daventry.<eos> I must say it's fantastic that you're getting on so well because you have a lot in common.<eos> Shall we get out of here and find a place a bit quieter?<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> Why not?<eos> I booked Gianni's.<eos> Great.<eos> That sounds lovely.<eos> You might have to sit this one out, Ari...
It's sort of a funny story.<eos> Sort of.<eos> You see, um, a few months ago, on the fourth of the month, I met Jack at a music festival.<eos> Right.<eos> And we got on very well.<eos> And sort of had, um, relations.<eos> And the next week, that is to say, on the 11th of the month at Jude's baby christening to be exact, uh, following the consumption of quite a lot of alcohol, Mark and I, well, we had similar relations?<eos> And this is the funny part, I suppose.<eos> Owing to these relations, uh, the resulting life form currently residing in my tummy could actually, in fact, be either of yours.<eos> I know I should have told you both before.
I know, it's all very confusing.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> So, however we choose, uh, to do this,<eos> the most important thing now is this.<eos> Is this.<eos> Okay, Bridget, I'm not gonna pretend this isn't a shock.<eos> But I want you to know, whatever the circumstance, you're right.<eos> The most important thing is the baby.<eos> Who knows, this could be a great adventure.<eos> I'm afraid you're going to have to excuse me.
And I don't know about vibes or negative energy or prenatal wind and even less about algorithms.<eos> So, I will confess that the laws of attraction are somewhat beyond me.<eos> In fact, Bridget defies comprehension generally.<eos> But despite, or perhaps, owing to the bewildering litany of catastrophes I've witnessed over the last 40 years,<eos> I feel I've come to know Bridget rather well, and I've spent those years caring for her very deeply.<eos> And that may defy automated reasoning, but there's nothing I can do about it.<eos> Nothing you can do about it?<eos> Maybe you should try and stay around a little instead of saving the world by cell phone.<eos> I make her happy, Mark.<eos> And I suppose your algorithm tells you you're destined to be together, does it?

Yes.<eos> Oh, good, good!<eos> You're at eight centimeters already.<eos> That's excellent!<eos> That means you can't have any drugs at all.<eos> What?<eos> Yes, you're too far gone.<eos> Well done!<eos> Oh, another contraction.<eos> I'm not sure how much there is to gain from you two being at the coalface, if I'm honest.
Just think what life's thrown at you already.<eos> You've turned disasters into triumphs with your sheer, joyful, indefatigable, infectious lust for life.<eos> You've managed this entire pregnancy almost entirely on your own, despite a lunatic mother, repressed men, and cheating boyfriends who don't deserve you.<eos> Just the last few moments.<eos> Just the last few moments, my love, and then you'll see your beautiful baby.<eos> What if it's not yours?<eos> Then I'll love him anyway.<eos> Just as I love you.<eos> Just the way you were, the way you are, the way you always will be.<eos> I think you'd better go and have that seen to.
You're pushing an entire human being out of your vagina.<eos> I'd like to see them thinking it away.<eos> And with 367 of the votes, the winner is, Pamela Margaret Jones.<eos> Pamela!<eos> Darling, it's Bridget.<eos> Not now, Colin.<eos> It's about the baby!<eos> I hereby declare that Pamela Margaret Jones is...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You'll have to excuse me.
Yeah.<eos> You know, I've gotten into hot yoga.<eos> I started doing some sessions.<eos> Nice unicorn, man.<eos> Oh, yeah, I'm big-time into 'corns.<eos> So magical, right?<eos> You know, they're the most lethal animal on the planet.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Guys, my name's Lexi.<eos> Just let me know if you need anything.
- You're not--<eos> Time out.<eos> I'm pressing the time out button.<eos> Okay?<eos> You guys barged in my house.<eos> I pay my taxes.<eos> So you're not gonna come here and treat me like I'm the enemy, okay?<eos> That's the first thing.<eos> Now, if you want to get into facts--<eos> You wanna talk about facts?
Don't do that to me.<eos> You give me a second. Okay?<eos> Don't fire back like that.<eos> First of all, fuck Mark Zuckerberg, all right?<eos> Now, I accepted because it was Facebook.<eos> And it's rude when you don't accept it and I don't know if the person on the other end can see me not accept it.<eos> That's why I accepted.<eos> Are you nervous, Mr. Joyner?<eos> Is it hot?<eos> Are you getting hot?

And, trust me, when this whole thing is said and done and you basically save the entire free world, she's going to forgive you.<eos> It'll all work itself out.<eos> It'll all work itself out?<eos> Okay, Bob, you know, I'm sick of playing games with you.<eos> Where's the real Dr. Dan?<eos> What-what?<eos> Oh, my-<eos> - Dr. Dan, I had nothing to do with this.<eos> He's fine.<eos> I'll get you some water in a little bit.
And security for this one.<eos> Get your asshole off my door! That's it!<eos> Bob!<eos> Bob!<eos> Bob! Bob!<eos> Mr. Joyner. Guess who we're about to arrest for conspiracy to commit treason.<eos> That's right. Your lovely wife.<eos> So, here's what you're going to do.<eos> You're going to tell us exactly where you and Bob are. Then you're going to go outside and you're going to keep Bob on-site until we arrive.<eos> And if he leaves, you lose.
90% of spy work is distraction. You get in there and distract that guard,<eos> I'm gonna get us a plane.<eos> What?<eos> I don't know what the hell you expect--<eos> Bob!<eos> Bob!<eos> Bob!<eos> Damn it!<eos> Hey, I need a plane.<eos> Sir, you cannot be in here.
The package.<eos> Thought you'd never ask.<eos> Wait!<eos> You're making a mistake.<eos> Hello, Bob.<eos> But you're dead.<eos> Not as much as people think.<eos> Look, he's not The Black Badger... lam.<eos> And those aren't the encryption codes, these are.<eos> He's lying to you.

Look at this guy.<eos> You crack me up.<eos> We made it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> Lisa.<eos> Got you.<eos> Baby, what the hell do you have in here? It's heavy.<eos> Lisa.<eos> And Ash, I'm gonna give you the headlamp.
James, man.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I actually thought that...<eos> Heather could still be out here.<eos> They're pathetic, man.<eos> God, I should've known they were... Fuck.<eos> I guess I just...<eos> Oh, god.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> I don't know about you guys, but I feel a little bit, you know, less scared being in the woods now.
"Jack!<eos> I love you, Jack!"<eos> And his head was so beautiful, and his mouth was beautiful, and his eyes were open.<eos> I was trying to keep the top of his head down.<eos> Keep it all in.<eos> He had the most wonderful expression on his face, you know?<eos> Just before they'd ask him a question, just before he'd answer, he looked puzzled.<eos> I knew he was dead.<eos> Mrs. Kennedy, uh...<eos> Don't think for one second that I'm going to let you publish that.
I'm not sure...<eos> What does an autopsy entail?<eos> I want you to explain to me.<eos> I want to hear all the details.<eos> I'm his wi...<eos> Whatever I am now.<eos> I want all the details.<eos> What, will they slice him open?<eos> Darling.<eos> Can I send somebody to help you change before we land?
They were both U.S. presidents killed while they were in office.<eos> And what about Abraham Lincoln?<eos> Do you know what he did?<eos> He won the civil war.<eos> He abolished slavery, ma'am.<eos> That's right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Bobby, please tell them I want the books on Lincoln.<eos> About his funeral.<eos> You'll have to share something personal, eventually.
You'll have to share something personal, eventually.<eos> People won't stop asking until you do.<eos> And if I don't they'll interpret my silence however they want?<eos> "Her brow furrows.<eos> "Her lips are drawn.<eos> "She holds back her tears, but she can't hide her anger."<eos> Most writers want to be famous.<eos> You want to be famous?<eos> No, I'm fine as I am, thank you.<eos> You should prepare yourself, this article will bring you a great deal of attention.
We must get this right, bill.<eos> We must get this right.<eos> It has to be beautiful.<eos> Did you tell them we'll need a horse-drawn carriage?<eos> We have to march with Jack.<eos> Everyone.<eos> A big, beautiful procession that people will remember.<eos> Mrs. Kennedy, you don't have to do this.<eos> Do what?<eos> In fact, I don't think they'll let you parade through the streets.

We can't possibly accommodate all these people at brookline.<eos> Mr. Kennedy, we need to discuss the funeral, sir.<eos> We all want to follow her lead, but we still don't know much about this oswald.<eos> There may be co-conspirators.<eos> I'll talk to her, but she makes the call.<eos> There's also the matter of the oval.<eos> What do you want me to do first?<eos> Hmm? Plan the funeral or pack the furniture?<eos> I know this is all delicate.<eos> That's why I'm approaching you.
Was this a bedroom during Lincoln's time?<eos> No, it was, uh, Lincoln's cabinet room.<eos> Are all the pieces from Lincoln's time?<eos> Uh, yes, they are.<eos> The most famous one, of course, is the Lincoln bed.<eos> It was bought by Mrs. Lincoln, along with the dressing bureaus and chair, and this table.<eos> Um, she bought a lot of furniture for this house, which made her husband rather cross because he thought she spent too much money.<eos> And on the table is the gettysburg address.<eos> This is probably the greatest treasure in this room.<eos> And this sofa and these two chairs, they were sold in that Lincoln sale I was telling you about, that Mrs. Lincoln sold.
Mommy, is it my birthday?<eos> Not yet, dear.<eos> But why am I wearing my party clothes?<eos> Special agent hill.<eos> Whenever Mrs. Kennedy is ready.<eos> Oh, Clint.<eos> We're nearly done here.<eos> It's the strangest thing.<eos> I hardly remember anything after.<eos> But I read about what you did in the papers, and I just wanted to thank you.
That was a close call, sir.<eos> You almost got us all killed.<eos> Yeah, but then I saved everyone.<eos> You don't get credit for cleaning up your own mess.<eos> And you destroyed one of my tugs.<eos> Actually, sir, if anybody's to blame...<eos> Sir, I lost my focus.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.<eos> You're grounded until further notice.
Yes.<eos> Yes, but I would like my fiancé back permanently.<eos> What was that?<eos> We've been getting these power surges the last couple days.<eos> You take a look at the houses I sent you?<eos> No, I haven't yet.<eos> It's okay.<eos> There's no rush.<eos> I saw Dylan at the White House today.<eos> I just think you two need to have a conversation.
The heads of state are coming online.<eos> David, are you seeing this?<eos> Yes, Madam President.<eos> I'm looking right at it.<eos> They could be initiating an attack.<eos> We need to strike first.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Hang on a second.<eos> To my eye... the design and the technology of this ship... is nothing like the ones that attacked us.<eos> I'm telling you, this is not them.
It would be wise for you to return the favor.<eos> - And there he goes.<eos> Where's he going? - Oh, I'm coming, too.<eos> - Catherine!<eos> - Something is drawing him out there... and I'm going to find out what.<eos> Excuse me, Director Levinson.<eos> Where the heck do you think you're going?<eos> Why don't you join us, Floyd?<eos> Everybody else is.<eos> Might do you some good.
And in that moment, it came to me, "pow!"... like a thunderbolt.<eos> And that's when I came up with the idea that saved the world.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sir.<eos> There he is.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> This book is a bargain.<eos> $9.95.<eos> It makes a great gift for your grandchildren.<eos> If you're lucky enough to have any.
They're on their way to Area 51.<eos> That Hercules right there is on stand-by.<eos> Madam President, can you take my father to Cheyenne Mountain?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I'm going with you, Patty.<eos> Dad!<eos> You're gonna need me.<eos> Wish us luck.<eos> Ma'am, we have to go.<eos> Director Levinson... I'm gonna talk to my supervisor... and make sure you get all the money you need.
- Are you sure?<eos> Hundred percent.<eos> This, right here.<eos> That's the best way in.<eos> Yeah, I got it.<eos> Captain, they're ordering all ships out of the area.<eos> There's a hundred million dollars' worth of gold on that ship.<eos> They think we're gonna leave it?<eos> They're out of their minds.<eos> Capitaine, you better come and see this.
- Can you get us his autograph?<eos> How often do you see him?<eos> These days we only see each other at Thanksgiving, but unfortunately... last year he had to cancel.<eos> What about you?<eos> Where are your parents?<eos> Visiting our grandparents in Florida.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> Where should we go, Mr. Levinson?<eos> I think the safest place for all of us to be right now is by my David.<eos> Since you're the leading expert on his condition, I really wanted you to see this.
It's too heavily armed.<eos> We're dropping like flies out here.<eos> Come on!<eos> I think we need to fly inside.<eos> No, that's suicide.<eos> Sir?<eos> Morrison's right.<eos> This is our only shot.<eos> Do it!<eos> We'll detonate the bombs from the Command Center... and we'll give you enough time to get the hell out of there.
That's sacred.<eos> That's worth fighting for.<eos> We convinced an entire generation that this is a battle that we could win... and they believed us.<eos> We can't let them down.<eos> And it wasn't luck last time.<eos> It was our resolve.<eos> We all have to fight... till our last breath.<eos> And that is gonna lead us to victory.<eos> You understand some of their language.<eos> I'd like you to tell me if any of these writings mean anything to you.
Enchantée.<eos> I'm Catherine Marceaux.<eos> - Could you give us a second?<eos> - I was never here.<eos> Listen, maybe you guys should stay with me for a while...<eos> I think that we'd really like that.<eos> Yeah, so would I.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I am.<eos> Thanks to you.
God, I love them so fucking much.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Corn's about to start singing!<eos> - Drop it, Corn!<eos> You got the best voice!<eos> - You're the man, Corn!<eos> You rule!<eos> Take it away, brah!<eos> Dear gods You're so divine in each and every way<eos> To you we pray
We'll shove pimentos up our ass By Zeus<eos> We'll exterminate the juice<eos> Und subjugate The whole damn Great Beyond<eos> In here We keep our wieners in our packages<eos> That's how it is<eos> It sucks<eos> But that's the way Our buns keep fresh and pure<eos> Baby, baby<eos> But once we're out the doors It's not a sin<eos> For us to let you Slip it in
- Is it cool if I just go swap it?<eos> - I don't give a flying fuck.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> You're back, man.<eos> Crazy!<eos> Did you go to the Great Beyond?<eos> Don't touch me, man!<eos> Ketchup, get your fucking hands off me.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - Oh, I'll tell you what fucking happened.
You don't even know what you're celebrating.<eos> You're celebrating your doom!<eos> Wake up!<eos> They're lying to your fucking faces!<eos> The Great Beyond is bullshit!<eos> - Why isn't anybody listening to me?<eos> - Hey, buddy, are you all right?<eos> No, I'm not all right.<eos> It's all a lie.<eos> Everything you've been told.
Yeah, Banana's whole face peeled off.<eos> Peanut Butter's wife is dead.<eos> Look at him.<eos> Jelly!<eos> I'm gonna fix you.<eos> I'm gonna fix this.<eos> You think I give a fuck about PB or J?<eos> Fuck this.<eos> I'm gonna kick your ass.<eos> How you like them apples?
Look at him.<eos> Jelly!<eos> I'm gonna fix you.<eos> I'm gonna fix this.<eos> You think I give a fuck about PB or J?<eos> Fuck this.<eos> I'm gonna kick your ass.<eos> How you like them apples?<eos> - Who, us?<eos> - No, not you.
- "When will it end"?<eos> When he stops drinking us.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> And stops eating us!<eos> - Same here!<eos> - Fuck yeah!<eos> And when he stops using us!<eos> What did he do to you?<eos> You don't wanna fucking know.
You wanna believe that?<eos> Or this?<eos> - I don't like bad things.<eos> - Me, either.<eos> We choose the more pleasant thing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, what this sausage is saying, it's just a theory.<eos> No, no, no, it's not a theory, you morons.<eos> It's a fact!<eos> I'm showing you physical evidence.
- Do it.<eos> - No!<eos> Don't do it, Corn.<eos> - Come on, Larry.<eos> You can do it.<eos> - Start.<eos> Don't you dare fucking do it, Corn.<eos> Don't you fucking do it.<eos> Dear gods You're so divine in each and every way<eos> To you we pray
Are you guys hearing this 211?<eos> Yeah, I fucking hear it!<eos> JOSHUA; Jeff!<eos> Northwest corner of Eighth and Washington.<eos> He's lucid.<eos> Officer is down.<eos> What the fuck is going on?<eos> All right.<eos> That's good enough, right there.<eos> You're going to do exactly what we ask of you.
THIS FILM IS A FICTION INSPIRED BY REAL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS<eos> The story I'm about to tell you took place at a time when the sky belonged to a select few.
An easy job.<eos> He only had to convince her not to testify against her boyfriend and compromise the Spanish government.<eos> It was the only time Paco wasn't suspicious.<eos> As soon as Paco 's face was made public, nobody wanted anything to do with him.<eos> After that, he had to flee Spain for 5 years.<eos> When he came back, nothing was ever the same.<eos> Gentlemen, I want you to taste this wine.<eos> There are only 50 bottles in the world like it.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> - Spectacular. - I'm glad you like it.
Is it real?<eos> As far as his fortune... Two accounts in the red and a bank loan never granted that Paco punctually applied for every 3 months.<eos> We also know that you worked for the Spanish Secret Service. But that didn't go very well.<eos> They tricked him. Paco was set up. The pilot.<eos> He's your assistant, partner,<eos> - friend?<eos> - Jesus Camoes. You've known him for 20 years, he's married and has 2 kids.<eos> Quite a family man.<eos> I admit it. There was a time in my life when I was excessively sociable.<eos> You're not in jail because this gives you diplomatic immunity.

Can you or not?<eos> Put out your cigarette.<eos> I can do it for one million dollars.<eos> That's a lot of money.<eos> We're good.<eos> There's something else.<eos> A serious inconvenience.<eos> Information will come to light that's harmful to me.<eos> What does it say?<eos> Something you wouldn't like said about you.
I promise.<eos> That lie would force the Minister of the Interior, Antonio Asuncion, to resign.<eos> - Where are we?<eos> - We just passed Perpignan.<eos> - Want me to drive a bit?<eos> - No, I'm okay.<eos> Go back to sleep.<eos> I have an apartment in Paris.<eos> You can stay as long as you need while we sell the houses and see what we do with that money.<eos> If you don't like it, I can put you somewhere else.

I know that today is your anniversary.<eos> Congratulations. I booked you a table at a very special restaurant.<eos> The reservation is at 7:30.<eos> Hans can take you and bring you back.<eos> How did you know it was our anniversary?<eos> It's my job.<eos> That was one of Paco's better skills. Know more about people than even they did.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Here's the key.<eos> Call me if you need anything.
And so was Paco.<eos> We're good.<eos> One more thing.<eos> People are lying about me.<eos> I want you to get me an interview with El Mundo.<eos> I know a lot of things and I can prove them.<eos> If they come after me, I'll go after them. I want them to know.<eos> The government, the opposition party, even the royal family.<eos> Nobody is safe.<eos> You already have enough enemies, don't you think?

It isn't safe.
She's a tough judge.<eos> She's a woman.<eos> She has to be.<eos> - When's his court date?<eos> - Tomorrow.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> What do you suggest?<eos> Nine counts would be a lot of jail time.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I don't pay you to say the obvious.
What do you suggest?<eos> Nine counts would be a lot of jail time.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I don't pay you to say the obvious.<eos> You're supposed to be smarter than me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Luis can't go back there.<eos> He's not well.<eos> I'm afraid of what he might do.<eos> I can put you in touch with someone who can help you disappear for a while.
- Are you Francisco Paesa?<eos> - Yes, that's me.<eos> I'm Inspector Gonzalez, Madrid Judicial Police.<eos> My assistant, Deputy Inspector Bermejo.<eos> - Nice house.<eos> - It isn't mine.<eos> - Would you like something to drink?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> Please, sit down.<eos> We're investigating Luis Roldan's disappearance and we'd like to ask you a few questions.
- It's the last time. - That one too.<eos> Go anywhere you want. I'm bored of waiting for you.<eos> You've gone and left so many times I don't know if I want you to come back. I'm telling you the truth.<eos> That takes a lot of practice and you haven't got any.<eos> Don't forget the painting.<eos> Have a good trip.<eos> He didn't say a word about my mistake.<eos> And I didn't find out what was really happening until some time later.<eos> I told you we needed to be careful with that drunk.<eos> You should wear this.
They want you dead or alive.<eos> Is my mother all right?<eos> Yes, she is.<eos> The rules have changed.<eos> - What do you suggest?<eos> - Professionals.<eos> - I thought you were a professional.<eos> - Another kind.<eos> An international organization.<eos> I know several that can help you.
The Ministry of the Interior has not ruled out any hypothesis.<eos> He was helped by at least one other person.<eos> A Civil Guard general, a drug trafficker and a member of the Italian mafia.<eos> He's protected by an underground network of mercenaries who transport fugitives from one country to another.<eos> Roldan is in hotter water than ever before.<eos> DRACULA'S COACHMAN<eos> THREE MONTHS LATER<eos> Yes?<eos> Captain?<eos> You have a call.
Please, I wish to be alone.<eos> Ludovico.<eos> - How long has he been here?<eos> He won't last much longer.<eos> My order.<eos> Luis.<eos> Mrs. Gerve is dying.<eos> I've been watching her die for three months.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I think you should take this.
Whose money is it?<eos> I want double what you were going to pay me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Please, don't stop. Keep walking.<eos> I know you're Jesus Camoes.<eos> You're friends with Francisco Paesa. You work for him.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I work for Minister Belloch.<eos> I want the route Roldan is taking from Laos.<eos> I'll give you 100 million pesetas to get it for me.
Like we agreed, it's not an arrest.<eos> In less than 3 years you'll be playing in the park with your son.<eos> We're good.<eos> I left your bulletproof vest in the bedroom.<eos> Have a good trip.<eos> I'll wait downstairs.<eos> You're taking that with you?<eos> Don't be foolish, Luis.<eos> They'll take it from you the moment you set foot in Spain.<eos> And you need it, believe me.
It's life insurance for you and your family. Let me hold onto it for you.<eos> You still don't trust me?<eos> Would you trust someone like me?<eos> I see myself in you.<eos> Please, don't make me judge myself.<eos> I already have the whole country doing it for me.<eos> I've never judged you.<eos> All in clue time.<eos> We're not in a hurry anymore.<eos> I wish you the best, Luis.
I've never judged you.<eos> All in clue time.<eos> We're not in a hurry anymore.<eos> I wish you the best, Luis.<eos> Thanks for everything, Paco.<eos> The 25 yards from the door to the car seemed eternal.<eos> We were transporting a man everyone wanted dead or alive.<eos> Someone could come out of any window, of any balcony or any shadow, and put an end to it all.<eos> Being close to him put us in the same place. In the middle of the same crosshairs.<eos> You should get your head down.
Can I get everyone's attention?<eos> Mr. Williams, please rise.<eos> Please raise your right hand, sir.<eos> Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
Higher than I can even describe it.<eos> And within seconds, there was a huge explosion.<eos> Projectiles coming from everywhere.<eos> The heat was overwhelming.<eos> Can you please explain to me how the Deepwater Horizon's alarm system is set up?<eos> The general alarm is set up to inform the entire rig of, number one, fire, number two, combustible gas, number three, toxic gas.<eos> Each condition has a distinct tone and a distinct visual light.<eos> On the evening of April 20th, did you hear any one of those alarms on the Deepwater Horizon?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Do you know why you never heard that alarm, sir?
I mean, if that cement job is compromised then everything above it is, too.<eos> Well, it's not compromised. Houston doesn't have a problem.<eos> So I assume Schlumberger guys said the same?<eos> Cement bond log they ran said the same, yeah?<eos> We are confident in the integrity of our cement job, are we not?<eos> Oh, we quite comfortable with the integrity of that cement, that for true.<eos> You guys are just like my granddad.<eos> Pardon?<eos> Well, you see, my granddaddy, he, uh, he never even went to the dentist 'cause he didn't wanna know all what was wrong 'cause then he'd have to deal with it.<eos> You don't wanna know if that cement job on this well is shit 'cause you're 43 days and $50 million over budget.

He's in the ET shop on the second deck by the coffee shop.<eos> - Thank you much.<eos> - Have a wonderful day, sir.<eos> And you, sir.<eos> Mr. Williams?<eos> Mr. Vidrine, are you lost?<eos> Not at all.<eos> Just was looking to come by and visit with ya for a minute.<eos> Well, how can I help you?<eos> Seems as though you had something more you wanted to say in there.

We really need for you to leave with this.<eos> Let's just get a... a quick pic.<eos> - Yeah, we'll take a picture. - Mr. Jimmy.<eos> Congratulations, Mr. Jimmy.<eos> Hey, appreciate it a lot, fellas.<eos> You got the picture?<eos> Come in, Shaker House.<eos> - Go for Shaker House.<eos> - Yeah, we got a good test.<eos> We're gonna start sending you some mud to clean.
Stephen Curtis?<eos> Keith Manuel.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You Okay?<eos> Everybody take a knee.<eos> Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.<eos> And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.<eos> What's your name, sir?<eos> Mike Williams.<eos> All right, you just need to get some rest, and when you do, after you're done, you'll talk to me and...
Where is my son?<eos> - Did he get off the rig?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Somebody help me!<eos> Baby, it's okay.<eos> I remember closing my eyes and... and saying a prayer.<eos> Asking God to tell my wife and little girl that Daddy did everything he could.<eos> And if I survive this, it's for a reason.<eos> Please raise your right hand, sir.<eos> Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth,
I'm probably gonna jump off an overpass in front of a semi, so... Or a u-haul. Not a bus.<eos> I'm not gonna be a dick and make people watch.<eos> But it has to be big.<eos> It's gotta be so big that it just...<eos> Done.<eos> Kills me. Lights out.<eos> 'Cause if it just maims me and I'm like... well, how's that good for anyone?<eos> Then I gotta find a nurse to smother me.<eos> How am I gonna get across "smothering" if I'm...<eos> We don't need to get caught up in the minutia. I just thought that an adult... you should know.
It's ocd.<eos> He had a conniption 'cause my mom won't by him creatine anymore since it fucks up your kidneys.<eos> I was like, "i know, Darian.<eos> I know.<eos> What does mom expect, you to win people over with your personality?"<eos> Hey, so, uh, just a heads-up, but yesterday when you were giving your lecture, you were like,<eos> "oh, blah, blah, blah and then the north seceded from the union."<eos> You meant to say the south seceded. You accidentally said the exact opposite.<eos> I didn't want to raise my hand and be all, "excuse me, these kids are pretty confusable."<eos> Just thought maybe you'd want to know.
- Ooh, that should work.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> No way.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Darian!<eos> Yeah! Come on!<eos> Darian!<eos> You need to get all these people out of the pool.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> All of you need to leave!
I guess he hangs out around here sometimes.<eos> Yeah, he's working on his project for sff.<eos> Sf-what?<eos> The student film festival?<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, um, I gotta talk to you about some homework.<eos> I didn't need to talk to you about homework.<eos> I lied.<eos> Are you enjoying my company?
Sorry.<eos> Really something, wasn't it?<eos> Let's keep things going.<eos> Our next entry, ladies and gentlemen, comes from erwin Kim... Whoo! Of...<eos> Thank you. Of lakewood high.<eos> Mr. Kim, would you like to come out and say a few words about your film?<eos> Come on.<eos> Hello.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> Uh, hope you enjoy this, uh...
- Good morning!<eos> - Hi, Liz!<eos> I won't stand for this.<eos> Liz, the boy's gotta learn how to shoot. I won't stand for this. Liz, the boy's gotta learn how to shoot.<eos> I won't have it.<eos> Well, he's gonna do it anyway. I won't have it. Well, he's gonna do it anyway.<eos> Better here than sneaking off somewhere else.<eos> You're scaring your mother.<eos> She ain't my mother.<eos> Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing...
You're scaring your mother.<eos> She ain't my mother.<eos> Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing...<eos> For inwardly, they are ravening wolves.<eos> Jesus is the Shepherd who protects you and your family from those wolves.<eos> And I am his dog.<eos> The sheepdog that gets the lambs back on track when they stray off the path.<eos> And some of you have strayed, haven't you?<eos> What do you people think?<eos> That God is well disposed towards you?

Liz...<eos> The reverend is a man of God.<eos> You're seeing things that ain't there.<eos> IfJesuscame backtolifeafter hewasdead... Couldn't that happen to Abigail's baby, too?<eos> Can you face-paint me?<eos> Could you help me for a moment?<eos> I'm doing something. Can't you tell?<eos> We've come to see if everything's all right.<eos> Everything's just fine.<eos> No reason for you folks to go wasting your time.
And when you've convinced your new husband, you can pay for the stagecoach from down there.<eos> How long you think you'll need?<eos> You two gotta come right away.<eos> Some fella just paid a whole pile of cash to buy out the Inferno.<eos> Get your asses moving.<eos> Your last night and you got to work too.<eos> All right now, listen up!<eos> Usually, we don't earn Jack-shit at the end of the month.<eos> Jackie, shut the fuck up right fucking now or I'm gonna fucking make you.<eos> This customer right here is a Godsend and he bought the right to all of y'all this evening and if he becomes a regular customer, well, you can all expect a big, fat, fucking bonus, courtesy of me.
This customer right here is a Godsend and he bought the right to all of y'all this evening and if he becomes a regular customer, well, you can all expect a big, fat, fucking bonus, courtesy of me.<eos> But I demand total commitment here.<eos> I mean, whatever happens, whatever the fuck he wants, he is gonna get it.<eos> Now if anybody, I mean, anyone does anything to ruin it for me...<eos> Well, they're gonna be punished.<eos> Shit, they're gonna be punished worse than I've punished anyone before.<eos> But with that fucking said, you do a good job, and, uh, shit, he'll take you all.<eos> I want this one.<eos> All right now, come on!<eos> You are gonna like this.
I want this one.<eos> All right now, come on!<eos> You are gonna like this.<eos> That's right, there you are.<eos> My little doves.<eos> Now, will you look at that, huh?<eos> These two right here, they're real young, real fresh.<eos> Untouched, if you know what I mean.<eos> We got all kinds here.<eos> We've got Chinese, if you like that kind of thing.
And only you can save me.<eos> No.<eos> Yes. I have sinned because we should have finished the ceremony first.<eos> Paul, the apostle, wrote it in the first Corinthians.<eos> Help me, Joanna.<eos> I can't. Then we shall both burn in hell.<eos> I am here to save you, so that you can save me.<eos> I will make you do it.<eos> You know I will.<eos> I won't let you do that again.
I need not answer to you.<eos> Only to God.<eos> No, thank you, Anna. Our God has other plans.<eos> It'll be all right.<eos> Use both hands.<eos> Don't let the blast scare you.<eos> You're a grown woman now, Joanna.<eos> Could I talk to you for a moment?<eos> I want to offer my apologies.<eos> I withheld from you that to which you have a right.
It does not have to be.<eos> "If any man thinks that he is behaving himself unseemly "towards his virgin daughter, if she pass the flower of her age, "and if need so requires, let him do what he will,<eos> "he is not sinning, let them marry."<eos> You filthy pig.<eos> You shall be scolded.<eos> Good girl.<eos> That sure as hell took long enough.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Gonna take a crap.<eos> Where do you want me to put this?
Do you ever feel like nothing you do matters?
He'll leave, just like his grandfather did.<eos> Emma!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Where's she going?<eos> That wasn't nice, Enoch.<eos> You know perfectly well why Abe left us.<eos> To join the army.<eos> And then he met a lady, and had a nice wedding cake, and a lovely little baby.<eos> Children.<eos> I know you'd all like a new friend, but I'm sure Jake has plenty of his own back in Florida.

Could you fetch it from the parlor please, Miss Avocet?<eos> Go and help the others.<eos> Miss Peregrine, what a pleasure to meet you at last!<eos> May we come in?<eos> Children!<eos> Would you make your way down the stairs, please?<eos> I give the orders in this house, Mr. Barron.<eos> Not today.<eos> You should know that Jake has served his purpose.<eos> If you value his life, I suggest everyone does as they're told.
Shut up, shut up, shut up!<eos> It's gonna get worse.<eos> I didn't make it top side!<eos> That weld can't hold in these seas!<eos> Ya gotta slow her down.<eos> I'm callin' the Captain back.<eos> It's comin' in!<eos> - It'll keep up? - Yeah.<eos> We've got a hull fracture in the engine room!<eos> All hands! Muster mattresses, blankets, whatever you can get your hands yet.
She's gonna be a mess.<eos> Miriam called for ya.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good luck, Pal.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Mr. Cluff.<eos> It's me, Bernie, Sir.<eos> Take yourself a crew, go out there help them fishermen secure their boats to the pier.<eos> Aye, yes, Sir.<eos> Sir, I need to... need t'ask you a question,
You get her outta here, and you get yourself to bed, you're too sick to be in here.<eos> 36-500, Station Chatham, proceed over the bar.<eos> I repeat, proceed.<eos> Once over, travel directly south, the radar's intermittent but it's showin' a pip.<eos> 10 to 12 miles east of Monomoy Point, movin' south. Over.<eos> Station Chatham, this is the 500... copy that.<eos> I hear what everyone's sayin'. You don't know what you're doing.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Maybe... maybe it's because you're not from here. You don't know what it's like out there.<eos> What the hell would you know what it's like out there, Miss?
You okay?<eos> Hold tight.<eos> They're ridin' so heavy, you can hardly see her.<eos> They're saying there's 7 or 8 up there onboard.<eos> Maybe...we take these guys back in... come back out.<eos> Can't leave 'em out here alone, that boat won't last.<eos> We all live or we all die.<eos> Right?<eos> You... you did good.<eos> You should be the last one off, Mr. Sybert.
We're 5 miles northeast of the Pendleton's last known location.<eos> - Proceed to our position. Over.<eos> - CG-36-500, Station Chatham, proceed to Pollock lightship and unload all survivors.<eos> What do they know, right?<eos> Right, Richie?<eos> CG-36-500, do you copy?<eos> If they know where they are... someone tell me where I am 'cause I don't know where the hell we are.<eos> Webber, do you copy?<eos> - I'm not heading' out to sea... no. - This is Station Chatham, do you copy?<eos> We just got you all off a... off a boat, so there's no way we're... we're gonna get you all up there.
All stations on full alert!<eos> Are you killing us, Sister?<eos> Two lost travelers?<eos> What's happening here?<eos> Is this bitch going to kill us?<eos> I think she'd like that.<eos> If it is death, my dear, we need time to pray.<eos> I'm trying here.<eos> Sister, I know a siege when I see one.<eos> What comes at you so hard you need a wall like this?
He has brought important records to help with the coming battle.<eos> - This is a 900 years old batte report.<eos> - A 900 years old battle report.<eos> At the Hans Gate, three beasts mounted the wall.<eos> They killed many men as they went forward.<eos> Then, by the grace of the ancient gods, the beasts stopped<eos> and sat peacefully, as we slaughtered them.<eos> There was a magnet on site just like this one.<eos> At the Hans Gate, was a magnet just like this one.<eos> I believe that magnet was the reason the two of you Westerners killed the Tao Tei so easily.
Hello, Janice.<eos> Doctor Hamilton.<eos> Everything's gonna be okay.<eos> My baby.<eos> I need you to relax your stomach muscles.
That's where we'll be adopting our baby from.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I just hate not knowing why.<eos> Excuse me. I'm looking for Doctor Wickliff's office?<eos> Oh, he's on the third floor.<eos> Just that way.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This is quite a CV.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I think you might find things a lot quieter here at Saxa Vord than you maybe used to.
Excuse me.

- Is that the heartbeat?<eos> Yes.<eos> A toast to my only son and heir beautiful wife and to my future grandson.<eos> - Cheers!<eos> - Cheers!<eos> It's good to have you back, Duncan.<eos> And, thank you, Tora, for bringing him.<eos> No, thank you, Richard, for everything, for the house, for my job, for... - the adoption.<eos> - It's what families are for.<eos> Anything you ever need, please don't hesitate to ask.
Leave the good doctor alone, will you?<eos> No, no, it's okay. Really.<eos> Can you read these?<eos> - Aye.<eos> - Jimmy!<eos> Away with you.<eos> Sorry about that, doctor.<eos> He'll not bother you again.<eos> The Trows, eh?<eos> Now, why on Earth would you be asking about these old stories?
Oh, just curiosity.<eos> You want to be careful.<eos> You know what happened to the cat.<eos> I'm just joshing.<eos> Are you going to tell me why this sudden fascination with our local folklore?<eos> Well, have you ever seen... these?<eos> - These are from the body you found.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> Because Andy McKie already asked me to translate them.<eos> What are you doing with them?
So as far as I can tell, they don't mean anything.<eos> I met a guy in a bar. Um, Jim somebody.<eos> He said he could translate them.<eos> - Jimmy McNally?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, I shouldn't set too much store by what he says.<eos> You know we do have a police force here, you know, Tora.<eos> It may not be much of one, but, um... it works for us.<eos> You're looking really good and I'll be seeing you in a month.<eos> And you get some rest, okay?
Oh, Sergeant Tulloch.<eos> Come in.<eos> So, how bad is it?<eos> - You're six weeks along.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Not the reaction you usually get, I'm sure.<eos> Well, it's early days.<eos> You still have options.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I'm going to write you a prescription for some pre-natal vitamins.
Probably there's nothing to do with our Jane Doe.<eos> What? So, that's... that's it?<eos> We have no ID.<eos> The case is closed.<eos> Look, for what it's worth, I looked through our database for the last 3 years and nobody matching Jane Doe's age or height was reported missing.<eos> Well, what if she wasn't reported missing?<eos> Then I don't know what database to look through for that.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> Doctor... would you let me get that for you?
And, what? You think Stephen Renney is one of them?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yeah, well, I do.<eos> Look, it's the 21st century and nobody would believe this stuff.<eos> It's crazy.<eos> All I'm saying is, there is something weird going on on this island and you can't just ignore this.<eos> Oh, it's McKie, I have to get back.<eos> I'll see myself out.<eos> Look, I'm sorry, Tora, but... it's a small island and a group with the kind of power you're talking about... they just couldn't hide.<eos> Ah, doctor, can I get you a drink?

I'll get you a pen.
- Yes, it's an easy mistake.<eos> Here, you, never mind her.<eos> Just eat your breakfast.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude but who did you say you are?<eos> My name is Dr. Tora Hamilton.<eos> I'm here on behalf of Detective Sergeant Tulloch.<eos> Who I believe spoke to either you or your wife on the phone.<eos> She was enquiring about your sister-in-law.<eos> I thought nobody was gonna be coming.<eos> Who told you that?
He said he got the idea of switching bodies, carving her up, cutting out her heart, from a local legend.<eos> He claims he did this alone?<eos> That's right.<eos> Well, what about Theresa Renney's X-Rays?<eos> Planted by Gair.<eos> When Renney found out, he panicked.<eos> Alison Gair is here. Right.<eos> Well, I hope this, uh...<eos> gives you closure, Dr. Hamilton.<eos> And, uh, I'd appreciated you keeping what I've told you between us for now.
I heard about Stephen Gair.<eos> I should have listened to you.<eos> Just...<eos> Answer me one thing.<eos> The other night, you weren't at work you went to a meeting with the Rite.<eos> - You followed me?<eos> - Just tell me why you lied.<eos> Well, it's supposed to be a surprise. Dad's organizing a big party for us when we get the baby.<eos> Why? Wha... When did you...<eos> Why don't you hold him?
We'll just have to keep looking.<eos> She must be here...<eos> - Duncan, what are you doing here?<eos> - He's looking for his wife.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> I came to warn you.<eos> I couldn't reason with her.<eos> She's here.<eos> I know.<eos> Sir, I think you'd better see this.
Does the prisoner wish to make a final statement?<eos> Tell my father that I'll see him in hell.<eos> My name is Dr. Sophia Rikkin.<eos> At six pm yesterday evening, you were executed and pronounced dead.<eos> And so far, as anyone in the world knows or cares, you no longer exist.<eos> It's better you to sit.<eos> My eyes...<eos> What are you feeling right now is normal and uncomfortable.<eos> Cal.<eos> I'm here to help you.
2016 my daughter finds the cure for violence.<eos> You've always been brighter than me.<eos> I'm late.<eos> I have to report to the Elders.<eos> Francisco Rizi's Grand Inquisition. 1492.<eos> War, religious prosecution, and the closest that Father Torquemada or any of our Order came to a finding the Apple of Eden.<eos> How are you, my friend?<eos> Well. Your Excellency.<eos> Next week when the Elders meet, we shall vote to discontinue your Abstergo project.<eos> We feel that giving you 3 billion annually, could be better spent elsewhere.
You like to keep the things in the family, huh?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm sorry if we caused you any discomfort.<eos> Is there anything I can do?<eos> That's something I can't manage.<eos> I'm here to make a deal.<eos> We need the Apple.<eos> And we need you to get it for us.<eos> You've been desynching in the Animus.<eos> We need you not to do that.
We need the Apple.<eos> And we need you to get it for us.<eos> You've been desynching in the Animus.<eos> We need you not to do that.<eos> Sending me back to the machine?<eos> No, you've already shown us what we needed to see.<eos> Will you let us free then?<eos> What do you hope to gain from the newcomer?<eos> Something that'll benefit us all.<eos> You too, Moussa.

[Orland] Typically not.<eos> Hook us up.<eos> I'm sure there's a scientific explanation for what's on these, but until you tell me, I'm not sending it up the chain of command.<eos> - You done?<eos> - [man] Yes, sir.<eos> - Get out. Seal us in. Wait outside.<eos> - Sir.<eos> [door closes]<eos> Nobody here has been able to make heads or tails of this.<eos> It's thrown a wrench into our entire operation for reasons I'm not at liberty to discuss with you. I can tell you we need answers fast.
- A shock delivered to the victim.<eos> I think you're reaching.<eos> Our business requires us to make suppositions.<eos> My business requires us to prove them.<eos> Your technician's job is to find glitches, so, he sees glitches.<eos> Your job is to find the enemy, so, you see the enemy.<eos> Locals believe in spirits, so they see spirits.<eos> Everyone is biased, in one way or another. So, my answer to you right now is that we lack data to support any theory.<eos> Okay.<eos> What do you need to make a more definitive statement?
Can you mount this thing... on a Delta vehicle?<eos> - I don't see why not.<eos> - [Orland] All right, good.<eos> We run missions into the city every day.<eos> I'll put you with our field tech, tell him how to operate it.<eos> I wouldn't put a tech in between this camera and myself.<eos> So, you wanna operate it?<eos> If you want that kill shot... you'll need a fast reaction time out there.<eos> Next mission, you ride with Delta.<eos> They're gonna get you close to this thing. You get me the kill shot... you can go home to Virginia without unpacking.
- That'd be a game-changer.<eos> - Think I can talk to the convoy?<eos> I'll them how to do the same with their equipment.<eos> When they come get us, they're gonna need eyes, too.<eos> I'll connect you to the main engineer back at base.<eos> Copy that.<eos> They're ready to equip their vehicles with whatever you need.<eos> Can you repeat the whole request back to me, please?<eos> Okay, yes. That's correct.<eos> What you need is a device that emits a very short wavelength of light.

[Orland] Masarov.<eos> The single largest power plant in the region.<eos> It's where the killings started.<eos> If they're man-made, they were made here.<eos> It's less than ten clicks from here.<eos> Our birds can make that, but... it's probably one way.<eos> I've been digging for clues with the civilians. I found intel on Masarov.<eos> It's been retrofitted several times over the last decade by the central regime.<eos> It's got "weapons research" written all over it.<eos> Okay, you and Clyne need to be embedded to infiltrate. It's up to the both of you to figure out how to stop this.
No, I know that, ma'am.<eos> It's out there.<eos> It's right out there with the boy still.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm just here to take blood.<eos> I'll give mine.<eos> Okay, go to that room over there and wait with the others.<eos> I'll call you.<eos> That room.<eos> You ever given blood before, Mr...
I have.<eos> You're the belt man.<eos> Desmond, yes, ma'am.<eos> Well, Desmond, we can't take your blood two days in a row.<eos> Well, that's good.<eos> I came to get mine back.<eos> - You what?<eos> - My blood.<eos> I need it back.<eos> Well, it don't work like that, we can't just give it back to you.
Now we got that clear.<eos> Now let me tell you my requirements.<eos> They're not as complicated as yours.<eos> They're very simple.<eos> As long as you're in this company, under my command, you will obey my orders. Period.<eos> If you can't do it here, I can't trust you to do it in battle.<eos> I'm putting you in for a Section 8, psychiatric discharge.<eos> Dismissed.<eos> Gentlemen!<eos> I want you to meet Private Desmond Doss.
I'm not going to pretend to be something I'm not.<eos> - I am what I am.<eos> - Sounds lonely.<eos> You lonely?<eos> - So, you don't hear voices.<eos> - No, sir.<eos> I pray to God and I like to think He hears me, but it ain't a conversation, like the one we're pretending to have right now.<eos> - Pretending, Private?<eos> - Well, yes, sir.<eos> I know all you really want to do is give me a Section 8, drum me out of the Army, but I'm not off up above.
- Well, yes, sir.<eos> I know all you really want to do is give me a Section 8, drum me out of the Army, but I'm not off up above.<eos> I just simply believe what I believe.<eos> Well, I'm trying to understand, all right?<eos> Was it God who told you not to pick up a rifle?<eos> God says not to kill.<eos> That's one of His most important Commandments.<eos> Most people take that to mean, "Don't commit murder."<eos> War is a completely different set of circumstances.<eos> Jesus said, "A new Commandment I give unto you, that you love one another, just as I have loved you."
Well, what the hell are you saying, Doss?<eos> You bruised half your body sleeping?<eos> I... I sleep pretty hard.<eos> Alright.<eos> If you plan on getting wet this weekend, make sure you put on a hat.<eos> Next.<eos> Don't want anyone coming back pissing cream.<eos> What, you don't want none for your coffee, Sarge?<eos> How about a shot right now, Smitty?<eos> - You speaking from experience, Sarge?
No less danger, just...<eos> While everybody else is taking life, I'm going to be saving it.<eos> With the world so set on tearing itself apart, it doesn't seem like such a bad thing to me to want to put a little bit of it back together.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> - Sorry, sir, nobody's allowed to go...<eos> No, you don't understand.<eos> My son is the defendant.<eos> I understand, sir, but nobody's allowed...<eos> - I have information that's important.<eos> - Sir, you are not allowed...
- I have information that's important.<eos> - Sir, you are not allowed...<eos> While the sentiments expressed are laudable, the facts of the charge seem incontestable, so...<eos> What the hell is going on out there?<eos> Let him go.<eos> - That's a Great War uniform.<eos> - It is, sir.<eos> Sir, I need to show you this.<eos> With respect, sir, you are no longer a member of the military.<eos> You are unable to attend this hearing.
Then, as a former military man, you know there are laws here...<eos> Sir, I know the law and I know my son is protected by those laws.<eos> They are framed in our constitution.<eos> And I believe in them, as he does.<eos> They are why I went and fought to protect them.<eos> At least, that is what I thought I was doing.<eos> Because if it wasn't for that, then I have no idea what the hell I was doing there, sir.<eos> Thank you, Corporal Doss.<eos> Let me have the letter.<eos> You must go.
Thank you, Corporal Doss.<eos> Let me have the letter.<eos> You must go.<eos> "The defendant's rights as a conscientious objector are protected by an Act of Congress and he cannot be compelled to waive those rights.<eos> That includes, in this case, his disobeying orders to bear arms."<eos> Signed, Brigadier General Musgrove, War Services Commander, Washington, D.C.<eos> Colonel?<eos> - I withdraw the charges, sir.<eos> - Then this case is dismissed.<eos> Private Doss, you are free to run into the hellfire of battle without a single weapon to protect yourself.
The 96th... or what's left of them.<eos> These are the guys we're replacing.<eos> - Seems good to me.<eos> - Clear.<eos> - As gold.<eos> - Clear.<eos> All clear, Sarge!<eos> Captain Glover.<eos> Lieutenant Manville, 96th.<eos> We've been assigned to you, sir.
We hold this spot, we mop up the rest of the ridge tomorrow.<eos> Okay, boys.<eos> Find yourself a nice safe hole in or near the bunker.<eos> Rotate watch every two hours.<eos> We don't know what's out there.<eos> Heads down, asses lower.<eos> And shoot anything that don't speak English.<eos> - Does that include Grease, Sarge?<eos> - Particularly him.<eos> I don't care if you need to take a piss or a dump, it ain't safe to go out there alone.
Sick on Thursday Worse on Friday<eos> Died on Saturday<eos> Buried on Sunday<eos> I, uh...<eos> I never thought of myself as a quitter...<eos> Fourth-generation farmer.<eos> But between the property taxes and the fertilizer costs, and insurance...<eos> Oh, to hell with it.<eos> What if, just temporarily, mind you, we put this year's taxes on our credit card?<eos> Do you like it?
Attempted murder.<eos> Those records were sealed.<eos> Is that a nine millimeter?<eos> .45.<eos> You better sit your ass back down in that chair, young lady.<eos> This is a big moment for you.<eos> Make a good choice.<eos> Lying on a federal employment application is a felony.<eos> So right now, I'm the only thing standing between you and significant prison time.<eos> What do you want?
I don't know.<eos> "How did everything go so wrong, so fast?"<eos> "It's cold.<eos> Turn up the heat."<eos> Christian Wolff, I presume.<eos> Mr. Blackburn.<eos> Lamar.<eos> Lamar.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Are you aware of Living Robotics' three income streams?
Yeah.<eos> You are well-informed.<eos> I never married.<eos> Never had kids.<eos> This company is my child.<eos> That said, money has never been a motivation.<eos> Balance sheets, profit and loss statements...<eos> My mind doesn't function the way yours must.<eos> I need you to be my eyes and ears, Chris.<eos> Whatever you need to do your job, you let me know.
Cummings.<eos> Yes. Um...<eos> These are all the files you wanted.<eos> I cross-referenced them by year, and alphabetically, so...<eos> It must have taken you all night.<eos> It sure did.<eos> Right.<eos> So...<eos> So...<eos> What do you want, Dana Cummings?
I brought my own lunch.<eos> No...<eos> I bring my own lunch, too.<eos> I can answer any questions that you have...<eos> I have no questions.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Yeah, you wanna make your own assessment.<eos> Yes, thank you.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm in accounting if you need anything.
Let's say I was looking at mugshots.<eos> How would that present itself?<eos> What exactly would I be looking for?<eos> Elongated face, protruding ears, poor muscle tone.<eos> Autism's nearly impossible to identify visually.<eos> The traits are behavioral:<eos> difficulty with social interaction, communication, lack of eye contact.<eos> Lack of eye contact.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good luck to you.
We good, Ike?<eos> All clear.<eos> Rock and roll.<eos> And how about you, sport?<eos> It's Bobby.<eos> I got nothing.<eos> Okay, yeah, I'm getting a feed on the camera now.<eos> Move it to the left side.<eos> Is all this really necessary?<eos> You should be watching his home.
I got nothing.<eos> Okay, yeah, I'm getting a feed on the camera now.<eos> Move it to the left side.<eos> Is all this really necessary?<eos> You should be watching his home.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What you think?<eos> That's your idea on the subject?<eos> Love it when people tell me how to do my job.<eos> I believe I recommended you leave the country.
How will I find you?<eos> You won't.<eos> I'll find you.<eos> There.<eos> How do you respond to rumors that some of the victims have wounds consistent with anti-aircraft rounds?<eos> I'd say the Chicago Police Department has ample experience solving all manner of homicides.<eos> Tom.<eos> Sir, how are the conspiracy and fraud charges related to the deaths of Lamar Blackburn and his sister, Rita?<eos> This is a very fluid situation with a lot of surprising revelations over the last 48 hours.<eos> Let me introduce you to the person leading the investigation...
Neurotypicals.<eos> The rest of us.<eos> What if we're wrong?<eos> What if we've been using the wrong tests to quantify intelligence in children with autism?<eos> Your son's not less-than.<eos> He's different.<eos> Now, your expectations for your son may change over time.<eos> They might include marriage, children, self-sufficiency.<eos> And they might not.<eos> But I guarantee you, if we let the world set expectations for our children, they'll start low...
Or...<eos> We haven't yet learned how to listen.<eos> Honey, for the hundredth time, don't wander off like that.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Can he visit with you for a while, Justine?<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Come on, folks.<eos> I'll give you the nickel tour.
'The best way to eat natto fermented beans.<eos> 'You need good beans... 'and to do it right.
Bells will ring at the New York Stock Exchange for another day, on this March 18th.<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> Are you listening?<eos> Are you paying attention out there?<eos> Good.<eos> Because it's about to get complicated, so I'm gonna start out slow and make it nice and simple for you.
A glitch.<eos> Shares of Ibis Clear Capital getting killed this morning.<eos> ...net loss of over $800 million.<eos> - It has gone haywire.<eos> - An algorithm...<eos> -...glitch...<eos> -...a glitch...<eos> -...glitch!<eos> - A glitch.<eos> Okay, so Ibis took a beating yesterday, but if you've been paying attention to me for the past 16 months, Walt Camby has made you a lot of money.
My money ain't funny and it keep comin' I welcome the money and the cash<eos> My money ain't funny and it keep comin' I welcome the money and the cash<eos> At the welcome mat swollen fat In stupid stacks, the cash<eos> My money ain't funny and it keep comin'...<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> The name is Lee Gates.<eos> The show is Money Monster, the day is Friday, and the Dow has dropped a seismic seven points this morning.<eos> - Ready scream one.<eos> - So what does that mean for the market...<eos> Should you...
See these drops?<eos> Get used to it.<eos> It's just the way the market works these days.<eos> Look at this. $3.50 here. Almost five bucks there.<eos> If you panicked here, you would have sold...<eos> - Who's that guy?<eos> - Who's what guy?<eos> -...you whiners, you chickens.<eos> - Camera 2.<eos> You know what I'm gonna tell you to do.
I might be the one with the gun here, but I'm not the real criminal.<eos> It's people like these guys!<eos> They're stealing everything from us and they're getting away with it, too.<eos> Nobody's asking how. Nobody's asking why.<eos> I didn't steal anything from you.<eos> Be quiet, Lee.<eos> You got to open your eyes out there.<eos> It's not like the government's no help.<eos> How they just look the other way, since after they're done stealing our money, they barely even have to pay any taxes on it!<eos> I'm telling you, it's rigged.
Our pensions were depleted overnight.<eos> - Diane.<eos> - Our savings gutted just like yours.<eos> Wait. Wait.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Are you trying to make me feel sorry for you?<eos> Is that really what's happening right now?<eos> - No, I just...<eos> - That's exactly what's happening.<eos> I understand you want specifics.
- Don't tell me to wait!<eos> What happened?<eos> He just shot out your monitor on the stage because you're giving him the same corporate bullshit!<eos> I'm not.<eos> You have to understand how delicate of a situation this is.<eos> I'm sitting 80-feet from a bomb! Don't talk to me about delicate situations!<eos> You have got to wake up and do the math here, because it is not adding up to me, either.<eos> Why is that so goddamn hard?<eos> Sorry, what do you mean?<eos> I mean, you better ask some real questions and get some real answers, and hurry the fuck up!
My job was about data.<eos> It was about math.<eos> It was about theoreticals.<eos> That's it.<eos> Yes, but this glitch was still a result of a program you designed.<eos> Wrong.<eos> It's user error.<eos> They're only calling it a glitch because nobody understands how the algo works.<eos> And if nobody can understand the math, then nobody has to explain the money.<eos> Well, that's why I'm calling you.
Lee?<eos> Do not make a move.<eos> If he turns around, we are all gonna die.<eos> Go.<eos> All right, Lenny.<eos> You're the last manned camera.<eos> Balls.<eos> Patty Fenn.<eos> Patty, Diane Lester.<eos> You better have something for me, Diane, and I mean, right the fuck now.

It's good to hear your voice, too.<eos> I'm calling you to let you know the information I gave you might have been incorrect.<eos> What the hell does that mean? "incorrect"?<eos> Walt is going to make a statement after all.<eos> We're in the car en route to Federal Hall right now.<eos> We'll be about 20 minutes away.<eos> Twenty minutes?<eos> We need help right now!<eos> I'm trying to help you, if you'll just listen.<eos> I'm going to send you a text explaining what I need from you.
- No.<eos> We're on the move.<eos> Clear a path.<eos> - That van comes with us!<eos> - Clear the sat van.<eos> What are these people doing here?<eos> Now they've left the building. They are taking to the streets.<eos> Kyle Budwell and host Lee Gates seem to be working together at this point.<eos> Hello?<eos> We're on our way to you now, but we need something more.
Well, here's your chance.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Everybody hates you.<eos> Okay, now look, everything is fine.<eos> So why don't we just put the weapons down, and let's just talk about it.<eos> No, I... I think we can talk with the weapons up. Right, guys?<eos> - This is Money Monster, coming to you live.<eos> - Back off.<eos> We're here with Ibis CEO Walt Camby.<eos> So, Walt, now that we have you here in person, we can finally ask the $800 million question.
You tried to convince us it's all too complicated for us to understand.<eos> But it's not that complicated at all, is it?<eos> It's actually the oldest story in the book.<eos> You took money out of your fund and you invested it here.<eos> Go.<eos> Right here in platinum mines in South Africa.<eos> Does that sound familiar?<eos> I don't have our portfolio in front of me.<eos> I can't exactly...<eos> You really need your portfolio to know where you put $800 million?
If it takes two years, if it takes 20 years, we will stay here and strike until our voices are heard.<eos> Pause.<eos> There.<eos> Right there. That's your glitch.<eos> Because that's what sent the mining company's stock plummeting, which sent your secret $800 million investment right into the toilet.<eos> Want me to keep goin'?<eos> - P em].<eos> You gotta see We.<eos> - You made people a lot of money, Walt.<eos> You just needed to wreck industries and destroy economies all over the world to do it.
You know, forget it.<eos> Just shoot him.<eos> Actually, I got a better idea.<eos> Up. UP, UP, UP-<eos> Take the vest off. Put it on him.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> Hold on.<eos> That's just gonna make things worse.<eos> I already told you, back off.
Listen, I'm gonna do you a solid. And trust me on this.<eos> Don't turn your back on anybody.<eos> You're a thief, Walt.<eos> And a crook.<eos> And I want to hear you admit it.<eos> I didn't steal a dime,<eos> -and we didn't do anything illegal.<eos> - Bullshit!<eos> - You manipulated stock prices.<eos> - You don't care what I'm gonna say.

- Please.<eos> Tell that to the Chinese.<eos> Tell that to the Russians.<eos> 'Cause if it's not us, it's gonna be them.<eos> Hell, it already is.<eos> You see, that's the irony about all this.<eos> You only came after me 'cause I lost you money.<eos> Nobody was asking questions when everybody was makin' a profit.<eos> You just gobbled up every dollar of stock you could afford.<eos> As long as we kept paying you 18% ROI every year, then you could keep bragging to your friends about what a genius you are.

What was Oogway thinking?<eos> I think he heard us.<eos> I didn't hear anything.<eos> He said you're a loser.<eos> I'm sorry, Oogway.<eos> Would you stop doing that?<eos> How was your first day teaching?<eos> Humiliating.<eos> I heard.<eos> Who told you?
Okay, I used to work with Oogway.<eos> Oh, Master Oogway!<eos> Now, he was a great warrior.<eos> We've heard of Master Oogway.<eos> Okay, okay, enough.<eos> Silence!<eos> Find Oogway's students, and bring them to me.<eos> By the time I am done with them, Oogway... there will be no one left who will even remember your name.<eos> Kai is coming!<eos> I am ready... to teach you a lesson.
How long do we have?<eos> Not long.<eos> Please, tell me you've mastered chi.<eos> -Here, take the baby. -Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> Okay, who belongs to this one?<eos> You need to teach me the secret chi technique now!<eos> No, no, I'm afraid you need more time.<eos> Everyone, go get your things!<eos> Let me help you with that.
What would dory do now?<eos> Who's dory?<eos> Oh boy. Are we happy to see you.<eos> Happy to see me?<eos> I'm happy to see you!<eos> I haven't had anyone to talk to in years.<eos> Years?<eos> Wow.<eos> Unfortunately we can't stay long.<eos> We have to go because-- now why would you want to go?
I'm sorry.<eos> Sweetheart, I need you to go home and look after Sammy, okay?<eos> But, Mom, I wanna help you here.<eos> -I know.<eos> Can you get her out of here now?<eos> -I wanna help.<eos> -Mom.<eos> -No, it's okay.<eos> Just go.<eos> Miss, you gotta leave.
For if she could not raise a child, then in it's place she would raise an army.<eos> Come on, boy! - No!<eos> - No!<eos> Eric!<eos> Run!<eos> Come on, you runt.<eos> Freya turned the once green farm lands of the North into a frozen wasteland.<eos> There she built her fortress, and rule as the Ice Queen.<eos> Charrets!<eos> How lucky you are.
If it's hot or if I'm running. - Me too!<eos> - Ha.<eos> Or sometimes if I eat something really salty. - Like roast chicken. - Chicken.<eos> I don't know what to say, she's my type. Loud and angry.<eos> Well, that's what I'm used to, isn't it?<eos> And I'm awfully sure you'll have a good life together.<eos> Aye yeah, we would.<eos> But there's a problem.<eos> Another woman.<eos> A bit taller, not as pretty mind you.
- You don't need to say anything.<eos> Just put it right there and use it as a conversation piece.<eos> - That's cool.<eos> Thank you very much!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Anyway, we should get going.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We should. - Okay.<eos> I feel like I should give you guys a gift.
- Must've been a lucky guess, I guess.<eos> - No, it's right there.<eos> - Lucky guess.<eos> Yeah, we should go.<eos> It's getting late.<eos> Thank you so much for everything.<eos> The coffee was delicious.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - And we'll see you at Junetoberfest!<eos> So, let me show you a picture.
You're what they call "collateral damage."<eos> That's not good.<eos> I saw it on Homeland! What do you me...<eos> You didn't say anything about collateral damage!<eos> I asked you about the worst-case scenario and you said,<eos> "Well, the worst-case scenario, I'll have backup."<eos> Well, this is worse!<eos> This is worse than the worst-case scenario.<eos> You lied to our faces.<eos> I did not lie to you.
You've been a pain in my ass all day, Jeff.<eos> Okay, li...<eos> Mr. Scorpion, we all make choices in life and I...<eos> I'm not being judgmental, I promise you, but do you really think that violence is the solution?<eos> He's all yours, gravity.<eos> And that's why you don't sting the...<eos> Always have plan B.<eos> I know it seemed a lot higher.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> That's for you.
Try to keep up.<eos> My magnificent bloody hounds.<eos> You are the true sons of Egypt.<eos> You are my children of iron and blood.<eos> No father could be more proud.<eos> The rebel gods have choked on our spears.<eos> The rest have retreated to Nephthys' stronghold where they now stand ready to face us.<eos> But you, my legions of the desert, will bring them reckoning!<eos> So take your fill of gold!<eos> And if you should fall in battle and travel the Nine Gates, tell my brother who it is you worship!
- Matthew!<eos> - ...shall get their $20.<eos> Get off him!<eos> Those of you who do not, may your good Lord help you.<eos> I'll help you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> The Lord's watching.<eos> What kind of man are you?<eos> What'd these people ever do to you?
- Let's put it out, men.<eos> We can't leave this!<eos> - Shit, it's on fire!<eos> It'll be burned to the ground if we don't hurry!<eos> - Stay back!<eos> - Wait, wait, wait.<eos> - Stay back.<eos> - Stay back, men!<eos> Come on, we're just trying to help.<eos> You don't get paid to help.
Get him on outta here.<eos> I have need of a man with your qualifications.<eos> You can't afford me.<eos> Well, can you at least describe the rates or offer up the particulars?<eos> Rose Creek.<eos> It's only four days' ride from here.<eos> A rich man has overtaken the town.<eos> He's killed half a dozen men.<eos> He's got the sheriff on his payroll and Blackstone agents in his employ.<eos> Well, you don't need a bounty hunter, you need an army.
If you're gonna kill me, kill me.<eos> If you're gonna rob me, rob me.<eos> But I will not go in that mine.<eos> There's rats in there.<eos> Virginia City?<eos> Three days past?<eos> Best you remember who'd you cheat out of $50 in a card game!<eos> I assure you I did not have to cheat to beat the likes of you two.<eos> Easy.<eos> Gentlemen, allow me a moment to show you something quite miraculous.
Yeah.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You still collecting scalps?<eos> The government don't pay a bounty on redskins anymore.<eos> You must be out of work.<eos> Now, that's part of another story, ain't it?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> We... We're looking for some men, Mr. Horne, some good men like yourself, to do a job.<eos> Going after a fella, name of Bartholomew Bogue and his men.<eos> Just... Well, just thought you'd be interested.
You don't, you die.<eos> Come on, Teddy.<eos> Focus.<eos> You got to be quick.<eos> You just lost your first gunfight.<eos> Try it again.<eos> Lesson two.<eos> It was never about the cards.<eos> Now, I'll give you a third lesson.<eos> Think you need that more than I do.
Come on out of there.<eos> Come on. Come on!<eos> Take off that gun belt.<eos> You all right?<eos> Nice and easy.<eos> Take off that badge, too.<eos> I'm still sheriff. Duly elected.<eos> Consider this a recall.<eos> Now, you're gonna deliver a message to your boss.<eos> Mister, you already sent him a message, only you're not gonna like his answer.
Now, what happened here was just an opening skirmish.<eos> The real battle is yet to come.<eos> The idea is that when it comes, it'll be on our terms.<eos> - On our terms?<eos> - Yeah, there's no way in hell.<eos> Son of a bitch'll come back with 200 men and slaughter us all.<eos> If you want to leave, leave.<eos> Just don't take anything you didn't bring with you.<eos> You want to keep your town, you're gonna have to fight for it.<eos> Now, we're here to help you, but you got to help us.
White people's food is for dogs.<eos> What'd he say?<eos> He asked that you kindly stop staring at his hairline.<eos> I will.<eos> As long as he stops licking his lips over mine.<eos> These bodies don't get buried in the church graveyard.<eos> You take 'em to Boot Hill.<eos> I expect we'll make ten miles by sundown.<eos> I suppose that undertaker's gonna get some business out of this deal.<eos> I guarantee you, there ain't no reason to be running off scared.
Mr. Denali, recruit an army to go back with us.<eos> Pretty.<eos> I mean good.<eos> Your shooting is good.<eos> Do it again.<eos> Sight the lowest part of the V, cheek resting against the...<eos> I had a father, thank you.<eos> I didn't.<eos> God dang it, I'm good.<eos> Why are you doing this, Mr. Faraday?
Sight the lowest part of the V, cheek resting against the...<eos> I had a father, thank you.<eos> I didn't.<eos> God dang it, I'm good.<eos> Why are you doing this, Mr. Faraday?<eos> I mean, why are you here fighting someone else's fight?<eos> I needed my horse back, and this was the price.<eos> Six pounds of pressure. That's all that's required to kill a man.<eos> And they say the nightmares never go away.<eos> Those nightmares, they keep you up often, Mr. Faraday?
Maybe you should consider returning the favor, you know?<eos> Okay, all right.<eos> - Evening, Mr. Chisolm.<eos> - Preacher.<eos> - What a beautiful night it is.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> I just wanted to take a moment to come up here and to thank you for everything that you've done for us.<eos> It's been a long while since we've been able to enjoy an evening quite like tonight.<eos> Before you and your men arrived, all of our everyday pleasures had been taken from us.<eos> To have those back, even if only for a moment, well, it might not mean that much to you, but, by God, we are all eternally grateful to you.
I can tell you that it's impossible to translate from an audio file.<eos> I would need to be there to interact with them.<eos> You didn't need that with the Farsi translations.<eos> I didn't need it because I already knew the language.<eos> But this, this is...<eos> I know what you're doing.<eos> - Tell me what I'm doing.<eos> - I'm not taking you to Montana.<eos> It's all I can do to keep it from turning into a tourist site for everybody who has a TS clearance.<eos> I'm just telling you what it would take to do this job.
Ian Donnelly?<eos> When was the last time either of you have eaten?<eos> - Last night.<eos> - Same.<eos> When's the last time you did something stressful?<eos> Does now count?<eos> Just saying.<eos> Who was being carted off in the medevac?<eos> Not everyone is able to process experiences like this.<eos> I'm gonna get some blood from you and give you an immunization dose that covers a battery of bacterial threats.
Remember, we need answers as soon as possible.<eos> What do they want, where are they from, why they're here.<eos> - This is the priority.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Everyone, this is Dr. Ian Donnelly.<eos> He'll be running this team here.<eos> Yeah, have they responded to anything?<eos> Shapes, patterns, numbers, Fibonacci?<eos> We can't tell what they are saying when they respond to "hello," so don't get ahead of yourself.<eos> What have you figured out?
Okay-<eos> Okay, slow down, fellas.<eos> Slow down.<eos> I don't wanna take away from your success in there, but, Dr. Banks, is this really the right approach?<eos> Trying to teach 'em how to speak and read?<eos> That's gotta take longer.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> It's faster.<eos> Everything you do in there I have to explain to a room full of men whose first and last question is, "How can this be used against us?"<eos> So, you're gonna have to give me more than that.
Leave your respirator on until you reach the equipment room.<eos> I know.<eos> Team 2, exit your vehicles and continue to the decontamination tent.<eos> Leave your respirators on and do not hesitate until you reach the equipment room.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Overworked.<eos> Well, I guess I don't need to tell you, you're putting yourself at risk.<eos> There are no signs of radiation poisoning yet.<eos> We'll see how your blood tests look.<eos> For now, I'm gonna give you another boost.
Unlike all written human languages, their writing is semasiographic.<eos> It conveys meaning. It doesn't represent sound.<eos> Perhaps they view our form of writing as a wasted opportunity, passing up a second communications channel.<eos> We have our friends in Pakistan to thank for their study of how heptapods write.<eos> Because, unlike speech, a logogram is free of time.<eos> Like their ship or their bodies, their written language has no forward or backward direction.<eos> Linguists call this "nonlinear orthography,"<eos> which raises the question, "Is this how they think?"<eos> Imagine you wanted to write a sentence using two hands, starting from either side.<eos> You would have to know each word you wanted to use as well as how much space that it would occupy.
Flowers.<eos> Colonel, those are all tile sets in mahjong.<eos> God, are they...<eos> Are they using a game to converse with their heptapods?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, let's say that I taught them chess instead of English.<eos> Every conversation would be a game, every idea expressed through opposition, victory, defeat.<eos> You see the problem?<eos> If all I ever gave you was a hammer...
Louise?<eos> We don't know if they understand the difference between a weapon and a tool.<eos> Our language, like our culture, is messy, and sometimes one can be both.<eos> I think it's quite possible that they're asking us to offer them something, not the other way around, like the first part of a trade.<eos> So, how do we clarify their intentions beyond those two words?<eos> Well, I go back in.<eos> Right away, we go back in and we clear this up.<eos> It's more complicated than that.<eos> How is it more complicated than that?<eos> Colonel, the Secretary of Defense is on the line for you.
Over.<eos> Alpha one-niner, this is Condor.<eos> Come in.<eos> Over.<eos> Captain Marks, Condor.<eos> Not receiving transmission.<eos> Squelch twice if you hear mine.<eos> Captain Marks, all escort groups are ordered to cease all activity.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Dr. Banks, you can't go in there.

Some soldiers.<eos> Been watching too much TV.<eos> What is that?<eos> Now, take it easy. Take it easy.<eos> The site's no longer secure.<eos> We're standing by to evacuate.<eos> Where's Ian?<eos> Weber came and got him maybe 10 minutes ago.<eos> But he wouldn't leave until he knew you were okay.<eos> The whole tent is on the clock to figure out whatever it is you were given up there.
Or we're one of 12 contestants for the prize.<eos> Why do I have to talk to him?<eos> We're all working together here.<eos> We need to talk to the other sites.<eos> We need to help them with what they've gotten from the other heptapods.<eos> In case you don't remember, we're blacked out.<eos> China just threatened to destroy their shell.<eos> We're on our own.<eos> Yeah, but this says that all of the pieces fit together.<eos> And I'm telling you that no one else cares.
If anyone is receiving this, please...<eos> Well, I mean, there are a lot of ways you can interpret what he's saying.<eos> I don't need an interpreter to know what this means.<eos> Russia just executed one of their own experts to keep their secrets.<eos> "Many become one" could just be their way of saying,<eos> "Some assembly required."<eos> Why hand it out to us in pieces?<eos> Why not just give it all over?<eos> Well, what better way to force us to work together for once?<eos> Even if I did believe you, how in the world you gonna get anybody else to play along or give up their data?
Costello?<eos> Where's Abbott?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We're sorry.<eos> I need you to...<eos> I need you to send a message to the other sites.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't understand.<eos> What is your purpose here?<eos> How can you know the future?
Your President said he was honored to host me at the celebration...<eos> - ...but I confess, the only reason why I'm here is to meet you in person.<eos> Me?<eos> Well, I'm flattered.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, 18 months ago, you did something remarkable.<eos> Something not even my superior has done.<eos> And what's that?<eos> You changed my mind.<eos> You're the reason for this unification.
Something not even my superior has done.<eos> And what's that?<eos> You changed my mind.<eos> You're the reason for this unification.<eos> All because you reached out to me on my private number.<eos> Your private number.<eos> General, I don't know your private number.<eos> Now you know.<eos> I do not claim to know how your mind works, but I believe it was important for you to see that.<eos> I called you, didn't I?
- Nice to meet you.<eos> Sra.<eos> Janus is not a coveted entry.<eos> You're the only man for hundreds of miles around.<eos> The next well not ... Why was vacant?<eos> Temporarily vacant.<eos> Trimble will be like new in six months.<eos> You need some recreation.<eos> Back!<eos> - Are you aware of that?
It looks healthier after three months than any of the others.<eos> Gentlemen, as they are.<eos> Where is Trimble?<eos> Hasluck talk to you about it.<eos> Tom, thanks for coming.<eos> I wonder why this meeting.<eos> We all thought that Trimble would recover quickly.<eos> But he jumped off a cliff in Albany.<eos> We did not want to think of another contract.<eos> You have proven their worth. And we offer you a three-year contract.
- Picnic?<eos> - Yes.<eos> That is excellent.<eos> Is there?<eos> We have to keep going.<eos> No time to think.<eos> You feel lonely?<eos> I'm too busy.<eos> There is always something to do.<eos> You like?
Here was, I am solely responsible for the light.<eos> For many years I shrivel everything he touched.<eos> And you're so full of life.<eos> It scares me.<eos> Isabel, a letter.<eos> I admire her too much to leave the grounds of my darkness.<eos> Tom.<eos> But I can not hide my thoughts.<eos> And my time with you allowed me to feel something again.<eos> And I thank you.
But I can not hide my thoughts.<eos> And my time with you allowed me to feel something again.<eos> And I thank you.<eos> I am eternally grateful.<eos> Tom.<eos> Dear Tom.<eos> I received your beautiful letter.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you for the opportunity.<eos> I know how hard it must be for you.
I also know how hard it is to lose someone.<eos> But we must continue with our lives.<eos> And you still have the light in you.<eos> I have seen it.<eos> And shines as clear as the stars in the sky.<eos> Isabel. I'm not so good at words.<eos> I've never been.<eos> I never knew that I also had to talk about my feelings.<eos> But now I know.<eos> I would like to show you the island and my life here.
- This is my husband, Tom.<eos> Hannah, it's Tom.<eos> My husband.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - How is it going.<eos> I'm glad what he said about the light is there for those in need.<eos> I want to ask something Mr. Sherbourne.<eos> Yes.<eos> ¿Rescues sometimes people at sea?<eos> Have you heard of the small boats with survivors? What will sail to the other end of the world?
Thomas Edward Sherbourne.<eos> Knuckey am the Superintendent, Police Partageuse.<eos> Roennfeldt represent Frank and his daughter Grace.<eos> Where is the girl?<eos> For the rear.<eos> Mrs. Roennfeldt received this letter last week.<eos> It's probably the same person who wrote three years ago.<eos> She does not know anything about it.<eos> Ask me to me, not her.<eos> I'll ask you a couple of questions when we're done with her husband.
Was dead.<eos> Maybe my wife testify.<eos> He was dead when we found him.<eos> Ask.<eos> So I thought, but ...<eos> But do not be surprised if she never saw him again?<eos> You can sit here and think.<eos> Isabel, the law accepts that a woman does not always act voluntarily.<eos> You will not be punished for his crime.<eos> But I must ask you a question.
How long?<eos> Enough for them to think about their actions time.<eos> Are they in jail for that?<eos> Ms. Roennfeldt, people are responsible for their actions.<eos> And when the line is crossed, they must be consequences.<eos> What about if I speak in your favor?<eos> For a lighter sentence?<eos> - A milder punishment?<eos> They would be fined and perhaps a few months in prison.<eos> Why you do that?
Good afternoon.<eos> She's lost?<eos> I hope not.<eos> I am seeking the house Sherbournes.<eos> - Tom and Isabel?<eos> - It's here.<eos> My name is Lucy-Grace Rutherford.<eos> I'm Lucy.<eos> Lucy.<eos> I want to show you something.
Somehow put him in mind... Of his family's tragedy.<eos> Slain by the jabberwocky, on horunvendush day...<eos> Many years ago.<eos> He's just not himself anymore.<eos> But, if anything could bring the hatter back, it would be seeing you again.<eos> -Oh, yes.<eos> -Indeed.<eos> Well, where is he?<eos> Go away!<eos> You can't come in.
Cheer up, tarrant.<eos> We'll have fun now that you're living here.<eos> It's tea time!<eos> Twinkle, twinkle little bat how I wonder where you're at up above the...<eos> Who's he?<eos> Greetings, underlings.<eos> I am time.<eos> The infinite and immortal.<eos> The personification of time itself.<eos> I know you may find this concept a little bit hard to digest...
It is a trifle.<eos> I don't see why you are making such a fuss.<eos> It is as nothing.<eos> I must have it back.<eos> But not that I'm concerned.<eos> As soon as possible.<eos> Either way, I'm fine with the outcome.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Who knows about it?<eos> Well, you are in luck, oh, timely one.
Have at you.<eos> Contrariwise, have at you.<eos> It's nearly 6.<eos> Hello.<eos> You have a very nice head.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And a nice head deserves a very nice hat.<eos> That's what my father says.<eos> He makes the best hats in witzend.<eos> Would you like him to make you one?
Can you?<eos> I can't believe he just said that.<eos> What?<eos> Can't bloody move.<eos> Wait! What's he done?<eos> The blighter's stuck us all at 1 minute to tea time.<eos> Tea time forever!<eos> Here you are, little ants.<eos> A nice new home.<eos> What did I tell you two?
For the hour!<eos> It's time.<eos> This is all my fault.<eos> I stole the chronosphere.<eos> I think you may have to steal it again.<eos> She ate my schnozzle.<eos> "And my fingers..."<eos> "...and my elbow!"<eos> Thank you.<eos> I think you look rather fetching without your schnozzle.
Did I miss anything?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Wilkins.<eos> Wilkins!<eos> -Wilkins! -Yes, sir.<eos> Oh! There you are.<eos> Stop standing around.<eos> There is much to do.<eos> You don't need a Butler, do you, miss?
Tweakers, maybe?<eos> Maybe.<eos> A little early in the morning for tweakers.<eos> Tweakers don't sleep.<eos> They just tweak.<eos> They rob drug stores and parked cars, not banks.<eos> Can I take a look inside?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Yeah, I'm here, Margaret.<eos> So they bopped you in the snozzola, huh?
Oh, who knows?<eos> Maybe one of these bank robbers is gonna want a gunfight and I can dodge my retirement in a blaze of glory.<eos> Well, I've seen you shoot.<eos> There won't be much glory in it.<eos> Oh, well, I'm lucky I got a half-breed by my side to avenge me.<eos> If you can stay sober long enough, knowing how you lnjuns like the bottle.<eos> Hey!<eos> What you all doing? You burning this field? Why in the shit would we do that?<eos> This kicked up on the highway, been chasing us ever since.<eos> Wish we could do something for you.
We do not.<eos> Good Lord, look at you.<eos> We would be obliged if you would provide accommodations, though we failed to call ahead.<eos> Boy, you are trouble.<eos> I'm the worst kind, darling.<eos> In your last days in the nursing home, you'll think of me and giggle.<eos> Why, God?<eos> Why won't you answer my prayers?<eos> You begged him for help, and yet you look around at your life and nothing is different.<eos> And so you assume that God has told you no.
You okay being with Debbie by yourself?<eos> Remember, he ain't the enemy.<eos> Just take the papers, say thank you.<eos> The oil man is the enemy, make no mistake.<eos> He just ain't ours.<eos> I'll be back to the ranch by dark.<eos> I will be waiting.<eos> Drive like a schoolteacher with all this shit in the back.<eos> Sure feels like beer o'clock.<eos> Ask and you shall receive.
Something else I got to take care of.<eos> Hi.<eos> Where's your brother?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Friend's house, I guess.<eos> How come you ain't in school?<eos> School don't start yet.<eos> Just 2-a-days for football right now.<eos> Your grandmother died.<eos> I'm giving the ranch to you and your brother.
How come you ain't in school?<eos> School don't start yet.<eos> Just 2-a-days for football right now.<eos> Your grandmother died.<eos> I'm giving the ranch to you and your brother.<eos> Remember going out there when you was little?<eos> What am I supposed to do with a ranch?<eos> Anything but sell it.<eos> We found oil on it.<eos> You and your brother ain't gonna have to worry about money no more.
- Count me in.<eos> Me, too.<eos> And me.<eos> I was wrong about you.<eos> Blow me.<eos> We know where you're going. Into the pit.<eos> We want to come.<eos> Please.<eos> Grab some gear.<eos> You're gonna need it.
But on our terms.<eos> An orchestrated apocalypse.<eos> One that would cleanse the world of its' population but leave its infrastructure and resources intact.<eos> It's been done once before.<eos> With great success.<eos> The chosen few will ride out the storm, not in an ark as in the book of Genesis, but in safety. Underground.<eos> And when it's over, We will emerge onto a cleansed Earth. One we can then reboot.<eos> And just how do you intend to achieve this?<eos> The means of our salvation are already at hand.<eos> I give to you, the T-virus.
I'm the child she was.<eos> You are the woman she would've been.<eos> No.<eos> You are so much better than I ever could be.<eos> I let this happen.<eos> I was weak.<eos> You cannot afford to be.<eos> Time is running out, Alice.<eos> The trinity of bitches, united in their hatred.<eos> Not that it'll do you any good.
Confirm security override 4365.<eos> Override confirmed.<eos> You will now take yourself offline and place all functions under my sole control.<eos> As you wish.<eos> Shutting down now.<eos> Dr. Isaacs.<eos> You and the Umbrella High Command.<eos> Yes?<eos> You're all going to die down here.<eos> Your little friend won't be able to help you now.
Good night.<eos> Good night, Dad.<eos> Night, sweetie.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is everything okay with you and Mom?<eos> Things just seem pretty weird lately.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I get laid off, I go from teaching PhD candidates to high school kids, and, no offense, it's just...<eos> I know it hasn't been easy on you and your sister.
- Ma'am...<eos> Get back in the car!<eos> Stacey!<eos> Get back in your vehicle, now.<eos> - Sir, we're just trying to see our Dad.<eos> - Stop, now!<eos> - Go right there... - Ma'am, get back in your vehicle!<eos> Please, sir.<eos> - We're not infected.<eos> - What part of "get back in your vehicle" - please. - Do you not understand?
Try keeping up, Judah!<eos> Don't embarrass yourself!<eos> Watch your back, brother!<eos> You're a prince, not a warrior!<eos> Prince Judah Ben-Hur, a Jew.<eos> Messala Severus, his adopted brother, a Roman.<eos> They were as devoted to each other as they were competitive.<eos> You're a cheat!<eos> Cheat?<eos> All is fair to you Romans!
Go to bed.<eos> Good night.<eos> We have different gods, Messala.<eos> Did we have fun?<eos> Esther, dance with me.<eos> I'm not allowed.<eos> Well, we can give people something to talk about.<eos> We can cause a scandal.<eos> Come on.<eos> Oh, let me help you.
It's the truth.<eos> God is love.<eos> He made us to share that love.<eos> And where will your love be when the Romans turn their anger on the rest of us?<eos> Hate and fear are lies.<eos> They turn us against each other.<eos> Those are the lies that make us slaves.<eos> He has a path planned for you.<eos> If He has a path planned for me, how am I better off than a slave?<eos> Why don't you ask her?
In a few days, he wants to ride through Jerusalem at the head of a legion.<eos> Why?<eos> The Zealots.<eos> I've tried to deal with them peacefully.<eos> Peace doesn't work.<eos> So now you try a legion.<eos> That's not my choice.<eos> All they want from Rome is their land back.<eos> It was never their land.<eos> It belonged to you, the wealthy.
I just care about keeping the peace.<eos> Then we're agreed!<eos> Look, Zealots are the common enemy.<eos> Listen, you're a prince.<eos> You have the ear of your people.<eos> Pontius Pilate has to ride through Jerusalem with no trouble.<eos> That's all I'm asking.<eos> Brother, I've been away a long time.<eos> If I come back now believe me, it's important.<eos> I want to give you this.
These are Judean graves.<eos> I'm informing Pilate.<eos> If you rule as occupiers, you will be met with disaster, I promise.<eos> Are you as treasonous as you are useless?<eos> That's my brother's bow.<eos> You should be resting.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I need to redress the wound.<eos> Sit.<eos> Well, if you want to call anywhere home again, you'll need to be more careful.
I know when I found you, you were almost dead.<eos> And for what?<eos> So you can say you evened up with the Romans?<eos> We're not trying to balance anything.<eos> We want the freedom we were born with.<eos> And if the Romans won't give it to us, we'll have to take it by force.<eos> How many Romans do you even know?<eos> Have you ever had a conversation with a single one in your life?<eos> Don't spit your hate for all when you don't even know one.<eos> Now, you're welcome to stay here as long as you need.
It's true.<eos> Well, you should be happy.<eos> You deserve to be.<eos> I know.<eos> I look like a monster.<eos> Nothing like one.<eos> You know this scar, of course.<eos> This one I got in Germania.<eos> Germania?<eos> The other one I can't show you. I...
They would have killed you, too.<eos> I would have died with my family.<eos> That's better than being alone with my guilt.<eos> I've filled my life in other ways.<eos> By serving others?<eos> I've found people to care for.<eos> People who care for me.<eos> When I can, I spread the Word.<eos> The message of Jesus.<eos> That carpenter, he showed you kindness when no one else would.
Judah!<eos> Have you been to the hillside?<eos> Have you seen the twenty they've crucified?<eos> What twenty?<eos> There's talk.<eos> A Roman attacked at the house of Hur.<eos> You did that.<eos> If people are dead, that's on Rome.<eos> You tried to kill Messala.<eos> I told you to stay away from him, Judah.
They can't die.<eos> You can't kill them quickly enough.<eos> If Messala is the pride of Rome, take their pride.<eos> Beat him in their circus.<eos> Give them a shame they will understand.<eos> I was accused.<eos> I'm meant to be dead.<eos> They won't let me race.<eos> They're Romans, Judah.<eos> For the right price, they'll let you do anything.
Step forward!<eos> Good.<eos> Steady.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good.<eos> It will get better.<eos> I couldn't see anything.<eos> In the circus, be aware of the drivers' tricks.<eos> Two riders part, suck you in between them, and crush you under their wheels.
Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good.<eos> It will get better.<eos> I couldn't see anything.<eos> In the circus, be aware of the drivers' tricks.<eos> Two riders part, suck you in between them, and crush you under their wheels.<eos> It's called the gate.<eos> I just need to get to Messala.<eos> Well, you think they're just gonna give it to you?
It's a dangerous maneuver, of course, but with courage and practice, it can be mastered.<eos> This is the spina.<eos> This is where I'll be.<eos> And I will try to guide you.<eos> Now, when the race begins, do not try to take the lead.<eos> Lay back.<eos> Let the other drivers fight for position.<eos> And the best strategy...<eos> But if I'm in the back, how do I get to him?<eos> The race will bring him to you.
You and Judah can make things right.<eos> How?<eos> Disqualify him, or disqualify yourself.<eos> And be branded as a coward?<eos> I'll die first.<eos> Yes, one of you will die.<eos> There is no victory in this.<eos> Oh, so, you've come to ask for my public humiliation.<eos> No, Messala.<eos> I've come to tell you of the hell you'll unleash.
I beg you.<eos> If there's even a chance they're alive...<eos> They are.<eos> Let him up.<eos> Prepare a horse for him.<eos> I'll be back, I swear.<eos> Take this.<eos> What for?<eos> He's a Roman.<eos> That's all the reason you need.
You go away!<eos> Gesius, they are dying.<eos> Let us take them.<eos> They have leprosy.<eos> Judah, please.<eos> I did what I could.<eos> It's better this way...<eos> I'll be back for them.<eos> They're lepers, they'd be stoned in the street!<eos> I will be back for you!
What, did the Ranch put this out?<eos> No.<eos> This is something else.<eos> Thank you, Levi.<eos> What you do now will decide our whole way of life.<eos> You have four days to get the boy back here.<eos> He won't give him up easily.<eos> But we must get him back in time, you understand?<eos> The Lord has placed a heavy burden on you.<eos> Peace be to you.
No.<eos> This is something else.<eos> Thank you, Levi.<eos> What you do now will decide our whole way of life.<eos> You have four days to get the boy back here.<eos> He won't give him up easily.<eos> But we must get him back in time, you understand?<eos> The Lord has placed a heavy burden on you.<eos> Peace be to you.<eos> And to you.
Red Saber?<eos> The number combination 53, 23, 77, 127?<eos> Yes.<eos> They're excerpts from my sermons.<eos> That particular one's from a reading,<eos> January 18th, 2010.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Did you write this?<eos> Yes.<eos> What if I told you that the words and numbers contained in your sermons include sensitive government information that, given the dates you provide, were transmitted solely by satellite through a heavily encrypted format?
The two are said to be traveling east into Arkansas, possibly into Louisiana.<eos> The man last seen driving a black...<eos> I'll take the first watch.<eos> You need to sleep.<eos> - You need anything?<eos> - A drink.<eos> You got it.<eos> Do not approach him.<eos> Don't try to apprehend him.<eos> If you've seen this guy, please call 911 immediately.
My name is Captain James Tiberius Kirk. United Federation of Planets<eos> I'm appearing before you, as a neutral representative...<eos> Of the Fabonane Republic. And bring you a message of good will... And present to you...
The emergency blockades are sealing... But the structural integrity is at 18% and falling, sir.<eos> Abandon ship, Mr. Sulu.<eos> Sound the alarm.<eos> We need to give those pods a chance to escape.<eos> Can you lead the ship away?<eos> Impulse engines are still trying to draw power from the warp reserve.<eos> We can not move until the SAUCER is separated.<eos> I'll handle it.<eos> Ay ay, sir.<eos> We got to get you guys to escape pod.
If you miss the combustion compressor.<eos> I am not gonna miss, come on.<eos> Do you even know what the compressor looks like?<eos> As squared, right?<eos> No, sir! It's round...<eos> That's what I said.<eos> Chekov!<eos> Chekov, move!<eos> You think you know... what sacrifice really means?<eos> Federation has thought you... that conflict should not exist!
She sleeved up image reflectors.<eos> Alright, some sort of holographic camouflage.<eos> Ay, sir.<eos> Captain!<eos> I intercepted a weak communication transmission, sir.<eos> It's a Starfleet frequency.<eos> Can you locate the signal?<eos> Yes, but how do we get to them?<eos> I have an idea, sir, but I'm gonna need your permission.<eos> Why would you need my permission?
Come in, Enterprise crew.<eos> Anyone.<eos> Come on, Spock.<eos> Come on, we can make it.<eos> Leaving me behind will significantly increase your chances of survival, doctor.<eos> Well, I stand sure that is completely out of question.<eos> It is imperative that you locate any surviving crew.<eos> No, I am sticking with you, I don't care.<eos> Of course I care about...<eos> I always assumed my respect for you is clear.
Deathstorn is quoting Shakespeare.<eos> Captain's Log, Stardate 2263.2<eos> We searched the wreckage.<eos> He must have hidden it elsewhere.<eos> All we have is his crew, Krall.<eos> You will tell me where it is.<eos> Now!<eos> No!<eos> Stop!<eos> Let him go and, I will give what you want.
No contact!<eos> Tom Larsen wasn't Frankie's shooter.<eos> He set me up, which means I am innocent.<eos> So if you came here...<eos> I came here to say I believe you.<eos> You are innocent, Cyrus.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm going to war for you.<eos> What does that... What does that mean, Red?<eos> All you need to know is I'm not giving up.
Huck could be dying right now... our Huck.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Yes, I will get it to Webster.<eos> Thanks, Abby.<eos> Hey.<eos> Pay attention.<eos> How much time is left on the clock?<eos> About 2 1/2 minutes.<eos> Then you need to move, Huck.
Rest your head.<eos> Goodbye, Huck.<eos> I can't swim that far.<eos> I can't do this, Liv.<eos> Liv?<eos> Liv!<eos> Liv!<eos> What did you do with Huck?<eos> You're asking the wrong questions.<eos> I'm gonna give you five seconds. If you don't tell me where Huck is,
What can I do?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Huck's missing.<eos> How can I help?<eos> We're working on it.<eos> There's nothing for you to do.<eos> Go back to work.<eos> I'll keep you posted.<eos> Yeah, you will...<eos> Because I'll be sitting at the conference table until you hear something or you need me.
Just shut up.<eos> Hey, you know what time it is?<eos> Look at your watch.<eos> Go on, look.<eos> It's 7:52.<eos> 7:52.<eos> 7:52... 7:52... 7:52, 7:52.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Come dark, you're coyote chum, bro.<eos> You were better off in the trunk.
Am I a good boss?<eos> You want to blame yourself for this?<eos> Am I a good boss?<eos> Olivia, three years ago, I was at whatever below rock bottom is.<eos> I am where I am because of you, because you always had my back.<eos> Huck knows that, too.<eos> He knows you got his back.<eos> Hey. No luck identifying your mystery duo yet, but I did get a hit on that Meg girl.<eos> Liv, there's something that we need to...<eos> What did I tell you?

No luck identifying your mystery duo yet, but I did get a hit on that Meg girl.<eos> Liv, there's something that we need to...<eos> What did I tell you?<eos> Liv?<eos> What did I tell you?
Liv, please!<eos> Everything!<eos> Where is he?<eos> Jennifer for Cyrus...<eos> That was the deal I made...<eos> That's it, I swear.<eos> So, help me understand.<eos> You kill Huck, frame Cyrus.<eos> For what?<eos> What did they give you?
What was your best outcome for selling out your family?<eos> I had no idea they would harm Huck.<eos> And you have just as much blame for Cyrus rotting in jail as I do.<eos> I have done everything in my power to get him out while you have done everything in your power to keep him in, to turn a blind eye to his innocence to protect your father, to protect your place in the Oval.<eos> You knew Cyrus was innocent, but you still...<eos> Huck might be dead.<eos> My Huck.<eos> You really want to lecture me right now?<eos> You think I'm in the mood?<eos> Do you think I won't get a chair and work it out on you?
We all have over and over.<eos> Don't tell me you're the only one who gets forgiven.<eos> All I ask is that you see that and that you try, please try.<eos> I'm asking you one more time.<eos> Can you help find Huck?<eos> Yes or no?<eos> No.<eos> Then you're worthless.<eos> Where do you think you're going?<eos> You think I'm gonna let you out so you can go get protection from your friends?
Yes or no?<eos> No.<eos> Then you're worthless.<eos> Where do you think you're going?<eos> You think I'm gonna let you out so you can go get protection from your friends?<eos> Get in there.<eos> You get in there and wait till Quinn finds out what you did and, Abby, I will not call her off.<eos> I will not save you from her.<eos> I will applaud whatever way she chooses to express her rage.<eos> So you better pray to God that when we find Huck, he's alive.
I...<eos> I'm gonna be somebody's husband.<eos> I might be a dad.<eos> You've got me here doing good deeds, which means hell has frozen over.<eos> You pulled off the impossible.<eos> You made hell freeze over...<eos> Miracle.<eos> You can't quit. You don't quit.<eos> Miracle workers don't get to quit.<eos> The thing also requires you to speak.
Miracle workers don't get to quit.<eos> The thing also requires you to speak.<eos> Everyone, conference room, now!<eos> We're not giving up.<eos> This is Huck, our Huck.<eos> He belongs to us.<eos> He deserves to come home to us, and that means whether he's alive or dead.<eos> I don't care what it takes. I don't care how long it takes.<eos> Hell could freeze over, and guess what.<eos> - You wouldn't care.
But there may be another option.<eos> Doing nothing.<eos> You said we don't know what they want, but we do.<eos> They want Mellie in the White House.<eos> So do we. Why are we fighting this?<eos> Because Mellie can't take the Oval this way.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because you're talking about fixing an election.<eos> We've been down that road before, remember?<eos> I remember. And because of Defiance, you became President.
Governor Reston, congratulations.<eos> One word.<eos> One single word.<eos> - Mellie.<eos> - "Yes." "Yes."<eos> All you had to say was "yes."<eos> Liv.<eos> Liv!<eos> Were you just gonna leave?<eos> I sent you an e-mail.
It's the best we could find.<eos> - Also, the cheapest.<eos> - I can see that.<eos> So... you and Leo Bergen?<eos> Really?<eos> It's just one date.<eos> He's taking me out to dinner tonight.<eos> - What?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Since you're here, why don't you make yourself useful and help me make some calls?
Since you're here, why don't you make yourself useful and help me make some calls?<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> I left Mellie.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> - I have a date.<eos> - What?<eos> Did you hear what I said?<eos> I came all the way out here from California to tell you in person that I left my wife.
- Hi.<eos> I left Mellie.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> - I have a date.<eos> - What?<eos> Did you hear what I said?<eos> I came all the way out here from California to tell you in person that I left my wife.<eos> Next time, make an appointment.<eos> I came here to ask you to marry me.
My place is so close to the office.<eos> - Your place.<eos> - You know what I mean.<eos> We don't have to look in the suburbs, but I'm ready for a place that's ours, not just yours.<eos> Think about it.<eos> We'll submit it again.<eos> Olivia, there wouldn't be any point.<eos> This bill, with this language...<eos> We've dressed it up a hundred different ways, and no one's biting.<eos> You need someone with muscle behind it, someone who doesn't work at a storefront.
- So, if you're doubling down with Marcus, that probably means you won't have time to launch a campaign,<eos> - which is why I...<eos> - He's not.<eos> Why are you getting snippy with me?<eos> - I'm not.<eos> - Yes, you are.<eos> These need stamps.<eos> Lindsey D.<eos> Yes!<eos> You really love torturing me, don't you?
We're expanding.<eos> We're doing well.<eos> I didn't... think it required an explanation.<eos> I thought you'd be happy for me.<eos> Marcus.<eos> We got the meeting?<eos> When?<eos> Honey?<eos> I've been thinking about our campaign rollout.<eos> You can't say you're running.
Look, this is awkward, but someone made a mistake.<eos> This meeting shouldn't have been scheduled.<eos> I am very sorry to have wasted your time.<eos> Have you tried reaching out to your congressman?<eos> Our first... female president.<eos> You'll beat Sally Langston in this race.<eos> She thinks she's the only one who gets to make history?<eos> We'll show 'em.<eos> You'll show 'em, won't you, Madame President?<eos> Tell me you don't love the sound of that...
- Why are you doing this?<eos> - Because I'm sick of seeing you like this.<eos> - Like what?<eos> You used to be a big dog, and now...<eos> - Now what?<eos> - Now I barely recognize you.<eos> - I get it, Liv.<eos> - You don't.<eos> I lost!<eos> You wanted the Oval, and I didn't give it to you.

You were unelectable.<eos> "Grant For the People"?<eos> Pathetic.<eos> Nothing more than a pipe dream.<eos> You never could have made yourself President.<eos> Only I could have done that.<eos> Kind of easy to say now, isn't it?<eos> I could've fixed the election.<eos> Defiance County... It could have been yours.<eos> I could have given it to you.
Only I could have done that.<eos> Kind of easy to say now, isn't it?<eos> I could've fixed the election.<eos> Defiance County... It could have been yours.<eos> I could have given it to you.<eos> I could have made you President.<eos> That was the only way you'd ever be President...<eos> Because of me...<eos> And I said no.<eos> Well, then, you should've done it.
I will stick by you, no matter what decision you make, but you never gave that man a chance.<eos> It's been two years, Abby.<eos> We can't all be you and David.<eos> And it's been 2 1/2 years since he lost the election.<eos> Abby.<eos> The man was dead in the water once it was clear to you he would never be President.<eos> I don't blame him for losing.<eos> I know...<eos> You blame yourself.<eos> You look at him, and you see your own failure, and it disgusts you.
He wasn't getting it from you, so he went on TV to get it from America.<eos> So this is on me?<eos> That's not what I'm saying.<eos> He's a disaster. I know that.<eos> I see it.<eos> But he's also your husband.<eos> Look, I hope I'm wrong.<eos> If I am, sign the papers.<eos> Put Fitz out of his misery.<eos> Just ask yourself why you never moved out of your apartment.
You wanted to be President.<eos> Sad, lonely, frigid ex-wives of failed also-rans...<eos> I don't see too many of them garnering votes now, do you?<eos> I didn't want it this way.<eos> I am not going to get it this way.<eos> You don't have a choice.<eos> You...<eos> You can't leave.<eos> You're smarter than that.<eos> You'd never survive a second divorce...
No. This... This... is the most harmless, cautious... prudent... thing you could ever do.<eos> In what world? !<eos> You're never going to fall in love with me, and I'm never going to fall in love with you.<eos> And you can be damn sure another woman will never come between us.<eos> How freeing is that?<eos> How can you not take comfort in that?<eos> I'll see you tonight.<eos> Let's order in.<eos> Liv.<eos> You have a visitor.
They took him from his rightful place.<eos> Cyrus was his choice.<eos> We have to do what is right.<eos> If anyone deserves to wear the white hat right now...<eos> White hat?<eos> ! For the love of...<eos> Get off your cross!<eos> Like you never murdered anybody?<eos> !<eos> Like you never stole an oval or two?
Of course.<eos> I know this is all very... new.<eos> But you're not just free, Cyrus.<eos> You're the next President of the United States.<eos> Get some rest.<eos> Spread 'em.<eos> The eyes of the world are now on Senator Mellie Grant, whose team has called a press conference for this afternoon. In the wake of Cyrus Beene's exoneration and release from pris...<eos> I know that sigh.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> That's the sigh of a championship rider whose horse keeps getting sold out from under her, which is why you have to own your own horses.
Guy sounds like a moron.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> First, it's this guy, then another elector in Florida.<eos> Another in Iowa.<eos> Texas.<eos> You're still in this thing, Cyrus.<eos> Can you let go of the door?<eos> Mellie, however, is not going to go down without a fight.<eos> The door. Let go.<eos> You need to take a shower. Shave. Suit up.
Texas.<eos> You're still in this thing, Cyrus.<eos> Can you let go of the door?<eos> Mellie, however, is not going to go down without a fight.<eos> The door. Let go.<eos> You need to take a shower. Shave. Suit up.<eos> You need to get out there and win this thing!<eos> Let go of the friggin' door!<eos> I begged you to listen to me. To believe me.<eos> I told you I was going to die.
No. No.<eos> This is over.<eos> Leave me the hell alone.<eos> I can't.<eos> - Yeah, you will.<eos> - No, I can't.<eos> Because you're wrong.<eos> This is not over.<eos> This is far from over.<eos> And I'm gonna prove it to you, Cyrus.
I can only imagine.<eos> But I know you can handle it.<eos> So, what did Olivia want?<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Olivia Pope.<eos> I heard she was in the White House.<eos> To talk.<eos> Obviously.<eos> Sorry, my mind is in this speech I have to give at CPAC tomorrow.<eos> Don't you think it's a little strange that one day Olivia's moving heaven and earth to bury Cyrus, and now, all of a sudden, she's his champion?

Because if there's a connection between them, then that could explain Olivia's behavior.<eos> I would love to work, but if we're not gonna work, I definitely don't want to talk about the inner workings of Olivia Pope's brain.<eos> Thank you so much for coming.<eos> Before I do this, I need to know, are you 100% sure Cyrus is innocent?<eos> I would stake my life on it.<eos> Dad?<eos> What's going on, Dad?<eos> It's been too long.<eos> I wanted to see you.<eos> Can I show you something?
- Inside.<eos> - What?<eos> Step inside the box.<eos> Their surveillance system, like any other, is simply a grid...<eos> An imperfect grid.<eos> It took a while to figure it out.<eos> A lot of sleepless nights.<eos> Counting steps, circling, listening to the sound of cameras shifting as I moved.<eos> These boxes are dead spots.<eos> You need to stop doing what you're doing.

And at night, I cried myself to sleep in an empty bed because the man I vowed to have and to hold couldn't be bothered to have me or to hold me.<eos> So, no, Cyrus Beene did not end Frankie Vargas's life, but he ruined mine.<eos> And for that, he doesn't have my vote.<eos> Well, there you have it, folks.<eos> Michael Ambruso, in his own words, telling the world that "till death do us part"<eos> ends at the ballot box.<eos> Shame on you.<eos> Cyrus was in jail because of a lie, and you just used his family to destroy him.<eos> It wasn't me... or Elizabeth because, like you, she just called, asking if I had done it, which I hadn't.<eos> If anyone should be ashamed, Liv, it's you.
A guard set me up.<eos> Let some Frankie supporters have at me.<eos> Needed stitches on the top of my head, cracked a rib.<eos> A drunk kid accidentally hit me with a rowing oar in boarding school.<eos> Pretty much exactly the same thing.<eos> You know why I'm here.<eos> Olivia sent you to get me to fight for the Oval.<eos> I'm sorry, Cyrus.<eos> I appreciate that, sir.<eos> Do you remember what I gave you in the hospital the night of the assassination?
Excuse me?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> And it's so ridiculous and so insulting that you're gonna have to say it for me to truly understand.<eos> This isn't about truth and justice.<eos> It's about something else.<eos> Boy, I am the director of the FBI, not some chick who got dissed at prom.<eos> I'm filing this warrant, and Olivia Pope is going to answer my questions.<eos> I hope you can respect that, respect how I do my job.<eos> And I hope to see you later.<eos> I didn't tell you on the phone.
Yes, that's what she said.<eos> She said she's my Chief of Staff, and the man...<eos> Peus?<eos> The man said the electors were bought or bribed or...<eos> Or threatened, and he said that their votes were rigged.<eos> And he said that I am the next President of the United States, just like we dreamed, only the nightmare version, and...<eos> It's...<eos> It's not too late.<eos> If they're bribing electors, we can follow the money...<eos> - If they catch you doing that...
This is how we win.<eos> Olivia...<eos> They bought the electors.<eos> Peus and Ruland.<eos> For Mellie.<eos> The only way to stop them is to make it so the electors can't actually vote for her, to remove her as an option.<eos> If Mellie Grant's campaign manager is arrested for framing Cyrus...<eos> - We have another option.<eos> - There'd be no way the electors could vote for Mellie.<eos> Why on earth would I allow you to go down for this when your father is guilty?

What are you saying?<eos> I'm saying the Oval can still be yours.<eos> Do you have anything stronger than this?<eos> Olivia, what the hell do you think you're doing?<eos> What's necessary.<eos> It's the only way to prevent Mellie from becoming President and to keep these people from getting what they've been after the entire time.<eos> If I go down, so does she, so do they.<eos> You've made the ultimate sacrifice, Cyrus.<eos> It's time I do the same.<eos> I can't let you do this.
Mellie Grant.<eos> What do you have to be sorry about, Red?<eos> Tennessee votes with the following result...<eos> - Mellie Grant.<eos> - All of it.<eos> North Dakota votes with the following result...<eos> Mellie Grant.<eos> California votes with the following result...<eos> Mellie Grant.<eos> I told you to leave my father alone!
Did I forget to put the...<eos> Not everything is about you.<eos> I run a whole damn country, leo,<eos> And not just any country...<eos> A superpower.<eos> I keep the united states of america afloat, Which means I keep the world afloat,<eos> So you could imagine how my boyfriend's shortcomings. Rank pretty low in the long list of things. That take up space in my brain.<eos> Whatever I did, I am sorry.<eos> I swear...<eos> It's not about you!
Jane.<eos> I can't imagine.<eos> David, you know who did this, right?<eos> You understand we can't let her out of our sight,<eos> Which means you have to keep...<eos> I understand.<eos> I'm good, jake, really.<eos> Laptop, cellphone, tablet, assistant...<eos> All brand-spanking, shiny, and new...<eos> A little "congrats on the new gig" gift from us to you.
We're moving.<eos> Principals secure in bunker five.<eos> I don't have a signal.<eos> I need to reach mellie.<eos> All cell signals are blocked within the airspace radius.<eos> To prevent someone from triggering a bomb remotely?<eos> Correct, ma'am.<eos> I demand to be with the president-elect.<eos> Ma'am, you do not have the authority or the clearance. To make any demands.<eos> If it makes you feel any better, neither do i.
Dad.<eos> Not you, hon.<eos> Him.<eos> Say it, mr. President.<eos> We need your help.<eos> Go on.<eos> Tactically, strategically, You'd be able to offer us a fresh perspective.<eos> Will you help us?<eos> No.<eos> I told you this was a bad idea.
What's defiance?<eos> Feeling a little parched here.<eos> Does this lockup allow for its detainees to drink?<eos> We never should have done it.<eos> What did we expect to happen... shut up, mellie.<eos> Don't tell me to shut up!<eos> My life is on the line.<eos> Okay.<eos> Perhaps if you had listened to olivia. And conceded the presidency, we wouldn't be here right now.<eos> I bet you would have loved that.
I've been a history teacher.<eos> You're not one now.<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm not, mr. President.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Just make sure she loves you.<eos> If she loves you...<eos> She can be any kind of tornado she wants.<eos> That is a damn fine bottle.<eos> I thought you might like it.
Robin, what are you...<eos> Chew. I don't want you to choke.<eos> I have some things I need to say.<eos> Huck told me about your conversation yesterday.<eos> Look, I get it. He and I have history.<eos> It was confusing almost losing him.<eos> I had a lot of feelings I needed working out.<eos> Robin, I-i don't...<eos> No, keep chewing. My point is,<eos> I don't want to act like you're worrying about nothing.
For pete's sake.<eos> They're recapping now, and we're still here.<eos> How does it feel to be so utterly useless.<eos> That no one bothers to come collect you?<eos> We just received word that any moment now, President-elect mellie grant. Will be making a statement from the white house briefing room.<eos> Let's take you there live.<eos> What statement?<eos> What the hell is she doing?<eos> That's the first thing you learn.<eos> Presidents rarely do what you want them to do.
You got to keep your eye on 'em.<eos> So, what a day, right?<eos> And not just a day... A week, month, campaign.<eos> And the minute you think it's over, New uncertainty raises its head.<eos> I've had enough of it,<eos> And I'm sure the american people have had their fill,<eos> Which is why I am proud to announce my choice. For vice president of the united states of america.<eos> Luna vargas.<eos> I'm sure you all have a million questions, and...<eos> Do you like being in secret service?
Because I'm not done fighting.<eos> I haven't even begun to make my peace.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Come upstairs with me.<eos> So I can die?<eos> Or worse, watch you die?<eos> Dad...<eos> If you decide to stay here, if you do not leave with me, that is what will happen.<eos> You will die.<eos> I'll have them send down some better wine for you, Dad.
We've been trying to figure out just who the hell you are for weeks.<eos> You don't seem to have anything resembling a life or a past.<eos> No high-school yearbook, no prom photo, not even an I.D. badge from your first job at the Dairy Queen.<eos> As far as the world knows, you don't exist.<eos> I used to be the same way.<eos> Twinsies.<eos> I need to find Peus.<eos> I need you to tell me where he is.<eos> You do that,<eos> I'll see to it that you go free.
You can hop on a boat, sail out to some island... disappear.<eos> Well, that's just not gonna happen, is it?<eos> It's a legitimate offer.<eos> I doubt that.<eos> But even if it were, I'm not a person who gets to disappear.<eos> Far too valuable to my employer.<eos> He makes it his business to know where I am every minute of every hour of every day.<eos> The only way I disappear is by a bullet.<eos> Either yours or his.<eos> And if I were to trust you? If for some unfathomable reason, I were to help you?
I just haven't had a chance to connect with him on the specifics yet.<eos> After I speak with the President, you'll be my first call, Mayor Barta.<eos> Red.<eos> - Why are you here?<eos> - You mean in my office?<eos> Instead of in the Oval with your boss, helping address this national crisis.<eos> Well, I've called four mayors.<eos> I have five more to go, and then a conference call with the House Armed Services Committee.<eos> He's frozen you out, hasn't he?<eos> Did you need something, Cyrus, or are you just here to annoy me?
This will be my legacy.<eos> Eight years in office. All history will remember me for is the body count.<eos> And your sex scandal.<eos> And that.<eos> I could have done better.<eos> I could have been better.<eos> - I know that.<eos> - Well... good for you for learning something.<eos> Are we done?<eos> Rowan, I know... about the boxes they sent you.
And your sex scandal.<eos> And that.<eos> I could have done better.<eos> I could have been better.<eos> - I know that.<eos> - Well... good for you for learning something.<eos> Are we done?<eos> Rowan, I know... about the boxes they sent you.<eos> Do you?<eos> They sent you a box every few days.
I admire you.<eos> You are not in control?<eos> That's what makes you just like me?<eos> That's what makes you know?<eos> You never wanted control.<eos> You don't know what control is.<eos> You are so...<eos> And she loves you.<eos> You!<eos> Let me explain something to you.
What is it?<eos> There are no tunnels.<eos> Don't play me for a fool, son.<eos> There's an exit to the tunnels just down the hall.<eos> I need the passcode!<eos> Now or never.<eos> Do you have the authority to guarantee my freedom, or don't you?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.<eos> But you get me out of here, and I'll get you that guarantee.
I need the passcode!<eos> Now or never.<eos> Do you have the authority to guarantee my freedom, or don't you?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.<eos> But you get me out of here, and I'll get you that guarantee.<eos> - Move.<eos> - Don't do this, Dad.<eos> Please.<eos> I told you I was running.
What's happening?<eos> Why all the commotion?<eos> - Not now, Red.<eos> - Is Fitz in there?<eos> - What's he doing?<eos> - He's waiting for me.<eos> Please.<eos> Cyrus, whatever's going on, let me in there with you.<eos> I can help.<eos> Why should I let you in?
You know you have dozens of people to sort through these for you.<eos> I'm being thorough...<eos> Hands on.<eos> You're being irresponsible, because you're scared.<eos> Scared?<eos> Of what?<eos> Of Abby.<eos> Of trusting Abby.<eos> I want this done right.<eos> You need to talk to her, Fitz.
Of trusting Abby.<eos> I want this done right.<eos> You need to talk to her, Fitz.<eos> Have the difficult conversation.<eos> Either you let her back in or you let her go.<eos> Don't you have another President to challenge and annoy?<eos> I do.<eos> Today's schedule...<eos> You've got Marcus at 11:00.<eos> He'll prep you for the BNC interview, tell you what kind of questions you're likely to be asked.
Don't you have another President to challenge and annoy?<eos> I do.<eos> Today's schedule...<eos> You've got Marcus at 11:00.<eos> He'll prep you for the BNC interview, tell you what kind of questions you're likely to be asked.<eos> Then at 2:00 we've got Ackerman coming over for pardons.<eos> His aide gave me a heads up last night about which petitions he'll be pushing.<eos> I could stay... Tell you which ones I'd recommend.<eos> It's being taken care of.<eos> Why don't you take the rest of the day and work from home?
You look...<eos> - What's wrong with you?<eos> - Can I come in?<eos> - Why?<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - David...<eos> - Sorry.<eos> I-I need to put this in the freezer or the fridge, but there was no room in my freezer or my fridge, and I thought Abby has a massive freezer and fridge, which is bizarre because she never has any food anywhere.<eos> Why is that?<eos> Why do you have such a big fridge if you don't use it?
David, is this some kind of joke, or...?<eos> David...<eos> Is this a human head?<eos> Yes.<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> - It was a gift.<eos> - A gift?<eos> From Rowan.<eos> Olivia's father, the skilled super-spy assassin<eos> - gave you a head as a gift.
Get a boat?<eos> Start deep-sea fishing charters?<eos> That would require dealing with stupid human beings.<eos> Why would I spend my day dealing with stupid human beings,<eos> - when...<eos> - So fishing alone it is.<eos> Better for everyone involved.<eos> Fishing, reading, traveling...<eos> Sounds amazing.<eos> Just what you need.
Better for everyone involved.<eos> Fishing, reading, traveling...<eos> Sounds amazing.<eos> Just what you need.<eos> You seem happy to see me go.<eos> It's not like this is goodbye.<eos> You'll last... three weeks on vacation?<eos> No.<eos> This is goodbye.<eos> It's what you need.
Well, we couldn't exactly find the final piece, but, Liv, I know he's innocent.<eos> I just...<eos> I have a feeling.<eos> You want me to take a racially sensitive tinderbox of a closed case to outgoing president with a legacy to protect because you have a feeling?<eos> Since when is the President's legacy our concern?<eos> He'd never sign off on it.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Trying to get back to work.<eos> You work here.<eos> Your name is still on that door, so I have to assume you still care about helping people,

- Mellie...<eos> - It's fine.<eos> You know, when you're me, things are only weird when someone's not trying to take your cake away.<eos> But this is my cake, Olivia...<eos> Bought and paid for.<eos> We will get to the bottom of this.<eos> My father...<eos> Damascus Bainbridge?<eos> Anybody else climbing out of this clown car?<eos> I promise you, in three days, you will take the oath of office, and the White House will be yours.
Altering the ceremony.<eos> I'm not stupid.<eos> Which is why you understand that the inauguration is just ceremony... pomp, fluff.<eos> Yet every president before me has had one.<eos> I understand what I'm asking you to consider, but you need to think about a Plan B if it comes to that.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To make sure it doesn't come to that.<eos> Of course Olivia's mom is behind all this.<eos> Woman makes my mom look like a saint.<eos> I ever tell you what'd happen if I'd stay out just one minute past my curfew?
- Maya.<eos> - I know you.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> You're arresting me?<eos> Well, that's what happens when you conspire to assassinate the President of the United States.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> That's crazy!<eos> Is this really necessary?<eos> I told you, I'm not behind this.
♪ To let my people go ♪<eos> Eli, Eli, Eli...<eos> Come on, now.<eos> You got to let me out of here.<eos> You think you are helping, but I promise you... You... are... wa-sting... time.<eos> Down the drain. Whoosh!<eos> Why would I come to town if I planned all this, huh?<eos> Answer me that.<eos> I would stay as far away as possible from this inauguration, and I certainly wouldn't be stupid enough to get caught.<eos> If you bring your ass in here, then maybe I can explain to you what I heard through my trusted sources and why I came to protect my daughter...
Nobody.<eos> Black women out here trying to save everybody, and what do we get?<eos> Swagger jacked by white girls wearing cornrows and bamboo earrings.<eos> Ain't that a bitch?<eos> But we still try.<eos> Try to help all y'all.<eos> Even when we get nothing.<eos> Is that admirable or ridiculous?<eos> I don't know!<eos> I know me sitting here is ridiculous when I could be helping, but you don't want my help.

- that she's trying to protect me.<eos> - From who?<eos> Whoever's really planning this attack.<eos> - You don't believe her, do you?<eos> - Of course not.<eos> This is my mother.<eos> She hired someone to kill Mellie.<eos> We need to figure out who that assassin is and shut them down.<eos> They're out there somewhere, and because this entire thing is completely off the books...<eos> - You need to hire us.

Tick, tock...<eos> No progress?<eos> Patience.<eos> Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock goes the clock.<eos> Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock...<eos> You remember Ocean City?<eos> Here we go.<eos> 4th of July.<eos> And the bushel of crabs that I undercooked?<eos> You get sick, Livvie gets stung by a jellyfish, and to top it off, we got stranded in that dry town for five days because of that tropical storm.
Dad.<eos> Dad.<eos> Couldn't do it.<eos> Couldn't let them take her.<eos> I'll let her go eventually, just not now.<eos> Mom will say anything to crawl under your skin and get what she wants.<eos> - You know that, right? - Mm.<eos> You have to go back in there.<eos> You're the only one who can break her.<eos> She's in custody. She can't hurt you.
I've had that chair forever.<eos> It's my chair.<eos> She's right.<eos> - About the chair?<eos> - About everything.<eos> People don't change. But power structures do.<eos> I don't know!<eos> I never married my boss before.<eos> - Guys!<eos> - Hey, I told you to cram it!
- She's not.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> We followed the money.<eos> And?<eos> Maya didn't hire the assassin.<eos> She is the assassin.<eos> Back for more, baby?<eos> - Mom.<eos> - Livvie.<eos> Did they hurt you?
Back for more, baby?<eos> - Mom.<eos> - Livvie.<eos> Did they hurt you?<eos> If they so much as laid a finger on you...<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm here now.<eos> Dad told me everything.<eos> I looked him in the eye.<eos> He believes you.

You have to let this woman go!<eos> She has rights!<eos> Get in here!<eos> You're gonna have to give them something.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> You have to tell them what you've been able to figure out so far.<eos> I'll be right here, by your side.<eos> I'll protect you, Mom, okay?<eos> When was the last time you ate?<eos> Have they given you any water? !

You know I'm right.<eos> They'll find another assassin.<eos> We can't let that happen.<eos> We won't.<eos> We're letting you go.<eos> Haven't we had enough play-acting?<eos> This isn't an act.<eos> This is us taking your lead.<eos> We're using you, Mom... As bait.<eos> Go out there and set up a meet with whoever's paying you.

As bait.<eos> Go out there and set up a meet with whoever's paying you.<eos> I want a name.<eos> I want to know who it is you're working for.<eos> There'll be a tracking chip implanted in you.
It was nice.<eos> - What have you done?<eos> - Wine's on the table.<eos> - I'm having some red,<eos> - Olivia, damn it,<eos> - but I've also got white...<eos> - what have you done? !<eos> Dad, if you want to come in, have some wine, relax, that's fine, but we are not talking about this.<eos> Because you know you're making a mistake.<eos> Because I can't tell you anything.
Keeping the missiles is an act of war which will lead to the end of the Belt.<eos> Using them gets us the same results.<eos> That is why they are both right.<eos> The missiles are useless to us.<eos> You, setara.<eos> You were on Eros too, yeah?<eos> You think this is over?<eos> I hope that it is.<eos> I have a feeling Fred and Dawes have a history.<eos> Which is why you should have stayed out of it.
They jammed our comms.<eos> I saw ships engaging in orbit.<eos> And the Blues, they were closing in on us fast.<eos> Fucking Earth has attacked us.<eos> They want a war?<eos> We'll give them a goddamn war.<eos> Oh, I could use one of these.<eos> Guarding the docks on Ceres.<eos> I don't think the Martians will give you one.<eos> They didn't give you one either.
- No. No. I believe you saw something.<eos> Now you say it was a drone, okay.<eos> What I wanna know is why is that so important to you?<eos> And why are you so interested in it?<eos> What do you think it saw?<eos> What did you see, Bobbie?<eos> I can't remember.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We can help you with that.
And the nightmare starts over.<eos> If the Belt has the protomolecule, no one will ever use it against us again.<eos> Diogo Harari.<eos> Forgive the intrusion.<eos> I'm Anderson Dawes.<eos> I wanted to meet the boy who was found floating beyond Hidalgo.<eos> How long were you out there before those rock hoppers picked you up?<eos> Uh, long time.<eos> Days.<eos> Were you scared?
Must have been a great raid.<eos> - Important station like that.<eos> - Sa-sa ke.<eos> No time.<eos> Fred Johnson just want people.<eos> Scientists.<eos> What for, do you pensa?<eos> You ran with the Five Points crew.<eos> I grew up in the Rosse Burt, too.<eos> Do you know how old you are?
Try and reacquire.<eos> - Got 'em.<eos> - Hang on.<eos> Prepare the PDCs.<eos> We cannot shoot them down.<eos> Not down. Out.<eos> Steady. Steady.<eos> Gotcha.<eos> Seal is good.<eos> You're gonna have to force their air-locked door.
Well, only technically.<eos> Shit. "Thanks for sharing" is right.<eos> Jesus, Harry.<eos> You know, we were just saying good food, good friends, - good feelings. - Yeah.<eos> Crap!<eos> It's 170!<eos> For God's sake.<eos> Watch out.<eos> Out of the way, out of the way.<eos> Barrel, for God's sake, I give you one job... one!
I just try to keep my head down, do my job, Chief.<eos> Not even remotely true.<eos> Which, of course, is the quality that recommends you and indicts you, depending.<eos> Those qualities weren't a problem when you needed my help.<eos> I'd like not to hear the name Bosch in my morning briefing anymore.<eos> How can we make that happen?<eos> You could always fire me.<eos> Short of that.<eos> Sir, I have no control over what people do or say about me.<eos> If you're expecting me to cut you slack for your current misadventures, you're mistaken.
Short of that.<eos> Sir, I have no control over what people do or say about me.<eos> If you're expecting me to cut you slack for your current misadventures, you're mistaken.<eos> I do not expect anything.<eos> I think you do.<eos> And I think if you're not careful, it will eat you alive.<eos> Thanks for the ride.<eos> Any time.<eos> See you after practice.<eos> What did you do with the ticket I gave you, Harry?
Chief Irving.<eos> Great minds think alike, I guess.<eos> How's that?<eos> Thought I'd drop in, go through the investigation, see what I can recommend.<eos> You beat me to it.<eos> No.<eos> No, I was just trying to see how I could help.<eos> All right.<eos> Thanks, Chief.<eos> Nestor, I, I heard the rumor you've been fast tracked for chief.
So maybe it's a good reason not to join the travel team.<eos> Becca didn't get asked to join the travel team.<eos> Everything all right with you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You going out tonight?<eos> No.<eos> Why not?<eos> Things change.<eos> You're like a turtle.<eos> Your shell's where you're safe, but nobody gets under there with you.
Your new boyfriend is shutting down the ER today.<eos> He's not my boyfriend, and he's making an unemotional decision that benefits the hospital.<eos> This was the best Level 1 trauma center in the city.<eos> That's why I came here.<eos> That's why you came here.<eos> After today, we're only doing electives, so congrats.<eos> All your cozying up will make you Chief Resident of Tummy Tucks.<eos> I'm not jealous, Cassie.<eos> I'm pissed off.<eos> And you're feeling better, which is a good indication the drug is working.
Well, I'm sharing.<eos> Well, then I will share four seasons of "The Bachelorette."<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Yes!<eos> Ooh, okay. I better get going.<eos> Otherwise, I'm gonna get sucked in and miss my surgery.<eos> - Hey, Dr. Lin.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I just wanted to say... you guys are the best.<eos> When you're diagnosed with the big effin' "C," you have this team behind you who's all, "We're gonna beat this."
- Luke?<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> You know him?<eos> Know him?<eos> I'm his godfather.<eos> Oh. I'm his grandmother.<eos> - You're Alex's...<eos> - Please.<eos> You can't tell her that I'm here.<eos> How do you like working days?
Like rats?<eos> - Owls.<eos> - Owls.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Big eyes, quiet wisdom.<eos> That's my type.<eos> You got to stop trying to distract me, Dr. Reid.<eos> - I'm on my rounds.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I would let you distract me at a more appropriate time.
You know, I, uh, I got into a fight with a mastodon.<eos> I told him it was irr-elephant. [irrelevant]<eos> I heard you were the new Interim Chief.<eos> Yeah, that's the rumor.<eos> I didn't think you'd want to be Chief again.<eos> I don't.<eos> Is it because you find it too difficult to be everyone's boss and friend?<eos> What did the piece of bread say when it walked into the operating room?<eos> Well, I just got tired of saying things like,<eos> "You need to take this more seriously."
Listen to my voice.<eos> You're gonna be just fine.<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> She hasn't been drinking, but I am quite concerned.<eos> What do you think's happening to her?<eos> Just getting old, baby.<eos> Man on P.A.: Dr. Reid to O.R. number 4.<eos> - Dr. Reid, O.R. number 4.<eos> - Go.<eos> There isn't anything new I can tell you right now, anyway.
Sutures.<eos> Clamp in place.<eos> Starting the anastomosis.<eos> - Blood pressure is leveling off.<eos> - Great.<eos> You okay?<eos> I got too involved.<eos> I risked her life.<eos> She's gonna be fine, Maggie.<eos> How do you always keep the emotion out of the OR?
Yes, it is.<eos> Chief.<eos> I heard.<eos> You can't make me wear pants, either.<eos> Okay.<eos> I quit.<eos> Enjoy Dawn's office.<eos> You, um, heard the one about the guy who walked into a bar?<eos> Maybe not the one about the guy who walked into the bar who hasn't called me since college.<eos> What do you want, Charlie Harris?
"Because I'm still examining you."<eos> Check. Please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, I try not to let it get to me.<eos> So you just throw yourself into the work even further?<eos> Yeah, but then the shift is over and it kind of creeps back in.<eos> And then you come home to a kid every night.<eos> I wouldn't know how to do it.<eos> Nah, see, he's the part that makes everything worthwhile.<eos> Thank you for this.
There are cops outside of our house Donnie, we have to get out of here!<eos> Rachel just wants power.<eos> She'll cut us all down.<eos> You'll bring back Cosima, Sarah.<eos> We know you will.<eos> Sarah, Rachel's taken the cure.<eos> Delphine was alive when they took her away.<eos> I found your cure.<eos> You can shoot me up like old times.<eos> You won't be allowed to stay with her.
Come on!<eos> There's so much to do today!<eos> Wake up, Mommy!<eos> - Wake up!<eos> - Kira?<eos> Hello?<eos> Who's there?<eos> I'm right here.<eos> I'm gonna keep you warm.<eos> You won't be allowed to stay with her.
And these... are your wellies!<eos> Do you know where Delphine went just now?<eos> Uh, to work, I think.<eos> At the clinic.<eos> - She'll be back.<eos> - I really need to talk to her.<eos> I know!<eos> It's a lot, right?<eos> You woke up in a yurt.<eos> You're wondering who all these people are.
- She'll be back.<eos> - I really need to talk to her.<eos> I know!<eos> It's a lot, right?<eos> You woke up in a yurt.<eos> You're wondering who all these people are.<eos> You just wanna know what's going on.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Are you gonna tell me?<eos> I'll show you.
Yeah.<eos> Are you gonna tell me?<eos> I'll show you.<eos> This is Revival.<eos> Come on.<eos> We're almost completely self-sufficient.<eos> We generate our own power, we have our own comms...<eos> Great.<eos> I-I need to talk to my sisters.<eos> Oh, you're not gonna be allowed to do that.
- Minecraft.<eos> Thank you!<eos> I saw her playing on her laptop at the safe house.<eos> - Do you think that would help?<eos> - It could, yeah.<eos> Great.<eos> Alright, I'm on it.<eos> Just keep after him.<eos> Major crimes.<eos> Man, I tell you, it's good to be back home!
Still!<eos> Damn, you're a survivor.<eos> But the thing is, your preppy friends are only worth what they know.<eos> And I'm betting they know where this one is.<eos> You ever meet the psycho?<eos> Running around all pregnant.<eos> No.<eos> Never seen her.<eos> I'm realizing... you don't know how far we're willing to go to bring all these clones in.<eos> You better embrace this new future, Art, because it's going to be here real soon.
- How should I know?<eos> Helena was out murdering God's creatures and my husband abandoned me.<eos> Where do you think they'd go?<eos> What is happening, Art?<eos> They want you to come in, Alison.<eos> Your sisters, your family.<eos> They want a truce.<eos> A truce?<eos> Kidnapping children is the Neo definition of a truce?<eos> You need to understand the benevolence on offer here.
- No, I can't.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Look.<eos> Think about it, Sarah.<eos> Whatever this place is, it's the answer.<eos> I don't give a shit.<eos> I came all this way.<eos> Rachel tried to kill me, Cosima.<eos> - You're going to come home with me!<eos> - No, you need to go back and take care of Siobhan and Kira, and I need to stay here for us.
I don't give a shit.<eos> I came all this way.<eos> Rachel tried to kill me, Cosima.<eos> - You're going to come home with me!<eos> - No, you need to go back and take care of Siobhan and Kira, and I need to stay here for us.<eos> We'll never be free if I leave now.<eos> - She's not here.<eos> - What?<eos> That's got to be for me.<eos> You have to go!
Well, maybe she's just crashing there.<eos> - Or maybe...<eos> - No, no, no, no.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> That's not Kelsey or Josh.<eos> I know, but, you know, a little alcohol, a little commiseration.<eos> I mean, they're both in their 20...<eos> - why are we going on Barry?<eos> - I am rerouting you.<eos> You don't need to walk past Josh's to get to the L.
- Grits?<eos> - Grits.<eos> Yeah, a little bit of cheese, some bacon.<eos> That's how you start your morning right in the mean, mountain state of West Virginia.<eos> I'm from Texas, darlin'.<eos> - You are speaking my language.<eos> - Texas?<eos> What... do you two-step?<eos> Do I two-step?<eos> You have so much to learn about me.
- see if I can...<eos> - Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.<eos> I know. Is that it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I... oh, sorry.<eos> - Okay, okay, ow.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> Sometimes if you massage the area just above it, it helps release the spasm. Ah.<eos> Oh, yeah, that's... oh, wow, that's actually a little bit better.<eos> You need ice and Ibuprofen.
No.<eos> You just weren't paying attention.<eos> Well, I am now. Trust me.<eos> That may take some time.<eos> - Understood.<eos> - Look, I know I was a cliché letting all that attention go to my head.<eos> Does it help to say I know I've been a total ass?<eos> And that I'm truly, truly sorry?<eos> It's a good start.<eos> But you're gonna have to do a lot more.
- This guy?<eos> - Yeah, they're all the same.<eos> 6 foot, corn fed, sandy blonde, sensible stubble.<eos> I take it these are your exes?<eos> - Yeah, she can't help it.<eos> - She's a dopple-banger.<eos> Has anybody at this table been naughty?<eos> Hmm.<eos> You two. Come with me. Ooh.<eos> How do you like that?
- Colin, very nice to meet you, and, uh, I'm sorry to hear about Random House.<eos> Yeah, appreciate that.<eos> - That was a surprise.<eos> - What happened?<eos> They dropped the option on my second book.<eos> When did that happen?<eos> Yesterday.<eos> Uh, bad move on their part.<eos> It's a great idea.<eos> Can I tell you about it?
It's a great idea.<eos> Can I tell you about it?<eos> Uh, sure.<eos> So imagine if the voyage of Christopher Columbus was financed by Catherine of Aragon instead of Isabella of Spain.<eos> So I'm obsessed with the complicated relationship that women have with power.<eos> How we can be vulnerable, but predators at the same time.<eos> Yes, the contrast is so strong.<eos> - I-I really love it.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> If you ever need an assistant, I would be so into helping you out.
- I-I really love it.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> If you ever need an assistant, I would be so into helping you out.<eos> I could stir your paint. I could stretch your canvas.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, that sounds like an offer too good to refuse.<eos> Oh, my God, okay.<eos> - What?<eos> - Oh, my God, I'm so sorry if I gave you the wrong idea.
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry if I gave you the wrong idea.<eos> I'm such a gigantic fan of yours.<eos> I'm just... I'm... I'm straight.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - I hope that's okay.<eos> That's okay. That's fine.<eos> Some of my best friends are straight.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Mm... but I have a show coming up in a month, so if you're still interested,
- I hope that's okay.<eos> That's okay. That's fine.<eos> Some of my best friends are straight.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Mm... but I have a show coming up in a month, so if you're still interested,<eos> - Oh, my God, really? - Yeah, yeah.<eos> - I would love that.<eos> - Yeah, great, fantastic.<eos> Well, come here. I'll show you my stuff.
- What are you doing here?<eos> - I'm looking for work.<eos> I'm sorry. That's not possible.<eos> Right, you think I'm not good enough for a place like this?<eos> It isn't about that.<eos> It's about us, about what happened.<eos> You know that.<eos> Sam, please.<eos> I've got nothing.<eos> You shouldn't have come here.
What about my speech?<eos> - Your speech?<eos> - Well, I am the owner of the hotel.<eos> I assume I'll be making some sort of address.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Why not ask the American to write it?<eos> Apparently, he's rather popular on the wireless.<eos> Sorry, it's...<eos> It's work.<eos> But I thought they'd cleared you of any wrongdoing.
Why not ask the American to write it?<eos> Apparently, he's rather popular on the wireless.<eos> Sorry, it's...<eos> It's work.<eos> But I thought they'd cleared you of any wrongdoing.<eos> They've allowed me to continue, but they're watching me very closely.<eos> Will you smile, please?<eos> You have a lovely smile and I never see it any more.<eos> Toby.<eos> Is it Mr. D'Abberville that's bothering you?
- Good.<eos> Cos it wouldn't work.<eos> When I think about what we did, I'm disgusted at myself.<eos> - Toby, I love you.<eos> - How dare you say that?<eos> You want to do me a favour?<eos> You want to help?<eos> Get out.<eos> Disappear.<eos> There is no place for you here and there never will be.
They say the truth and lies sound different.<eos> - But they don't, do they?<eos> - Priscilla... you're being emotional.<eos> No.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - Darling, let's just put them away.<eos> Is it true about the... documents?<eos> The Germans?<eos> What?<eos> Look, I don't know what Toby's been saying to you, but he... he has his own problems.
Was any of it true? Any of it at all?<eos> Answer me!<eos> Look, I didn't intend...<eos> for things to move so fast.<eos> But you were so starved of attention and affection, it...<eos> I loved you in my own way.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> That was my way out!<eos> This isn't something I'm gonna let you walk away from.
We believe he was intent on taking a substantial sum of money from her.<eos> It is, as you can imagine... a very embarrassing situation.<eos> And her husband barely cold in the grave.<eos> We'll be in touch, Mr. Garland.<eos> Tom, have the police been to the hotel at all?<eos> Not that I know of.<eos> Mr. Hamilton.<eos> Sorry. I've got a letter here for you.<eos> It's from Mr. Joshi.<eos> - Tom, when did he give this to you?
- [buzzing continues]<eos> Otto:<eos> That's awful stupid, white boy.<eos> - Just trying to show you.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> - Real still.<eos> Look, there's no problem here.<eos> Defense of others. Works just like self-defense.<eos> Guy comes in here with a mask, pointing a gun at us.<eos> He's right. You'll never be charged.
He didn't call?<eos> Must have slipped his mind.<eos> Yeah, well, you know Pete.<eos> Speaking of which, how do you know Pete?<eos> Look, I get it. I let you give me the runaround last time.<eos> You think you can do it again.<eos> Thing is now I'm up against a deadline.<eos> Yeah, and now I have a shotgun.<eos> You ever see what one of those can do to a man's body at this range?<eos> You ought to back up.
I need you to go back inside, honey.<eos> Grandpa says that's not a toy.<eos> Ellen, I need you to go watch another show.<eos> Things are fine.<eos> I am a police officer.<eos> Ellen, I'm not playing around.<eos> I'm looking for Pete.<eos> Is he inside the house right now?<eos> Mm-mmm. You wouldn't lie to a police officer, would you?<eos> I want to tell you I trust you a hundred percent.
Let's go.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Do you wanna see what Audrey and your sisters did to my fucking car?<eos> They keyed it.<eos> The Pink Lady, they fucking keyed it.<eos> It's bad enough that they harass us, with their nuisance complaints.<eos> You haven't been parking in their spaces? Hmm?<eos> - You coming?<eos> - Yeah, no, I've seen a keyed car before<eos> Whatever. I just thought maybe you would like to see the damage, because you're gonna be paying to have it fixed.
That's the bad news.<eos> Badge is real. Gun, too.<eos> Good news is I'm not here for you.<eos> Who you here for?<eos> - This one? - Yeah.<eos> - He mean anything to you?<eos> - No, I just met him.<eos> You expect me to believe you're not a part of this?<eos> You believe whatever you want to believe.<eos> I'm offering you a choice.
The money's back in the safe. Dockery's money, all of it.<eos> How do you...<eos> 'Cause I just watched Pete put it back in there.<eos> There's no time.<eos> The only way this ends is if we can find a way for you to open the safe without telling them that you were lying when you said you couldn't. You got the combo written down somewhere?<eos> You say you can't get to it, but I need to know for sure.<eos> Man is gonna cut off your ears, your nose, your tongue, maybe pop your eyes out of your skull, and if the safe is still not open, then we owe you an apology.<eos> Okay, I don't know if you're aware of the memory lapses that he's been suffering since his recent stroke. It's like daytime blackouts.<eos> What if he forgot that he actually can open the safe?<eos> This locksmith you had in the other day, is it possible he gave you a piece of paper?

[stammers]<eos> Yeah, it's possible. Okay, let's come at it this way.<eos> If he had given you something, where would you have put it?
- Fuck him.<eos> This is our time.<eos> - 500 grand.<eos> You let me go, I'll give you $500,000.<eos> How many jackets are you wearing? - I don't have it here. - No kidding.<eos> 12 hours.<eos> It took you a week to get the 150.<eos> Listen, I've been working a long con on Vince.<eos> It's all set to go as soon as I get to Chinatown.<eos> So instead of putting you in the ground right now, putting 50 grand in my own pocket, still getting to be the hero who brings Vince his hundred, you want me to give you 12 more hours to con a guy you couldn't con the last time.
In the midst of life, we are in death.<eos> In the midst of death, we are in life.<eos> - It was a nice service. - Hmm.<eos> And he had a good, long life.<eos> He did, for a heroin addict.<eos> Sad Archer wasn't there.<eos> Or here.<eos> It's been a long couple of months.<eos> Three, next week.<eos> You should go sleep in a real bed.
Well, dreaming about, I suppose.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Noooo!<eos> Let me go, goddammit.<eos> Come on!<eos> Go easy, Archer.<eos> Poovey, I swear to Christ, I will punch you right in the... genitals.
So, I guess we're done here?<eos> We're done when I say we're done.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Let me rephrase that.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, one of two things is gonna happen here.<eos> Hm. Wonder what the other thing was?<eos> Goddamn.<eos> Is it your feeding time already?<eos> I wish you wouldn't antagonize him.

Wonder what the other thing was?<eos> Goddamn.<eos> Is it your feeding time already?<eos> I wish you wouldn't antagonize him.<eos> Well, I wish you could hold a tempo.
Which, clearly, sarcastic.<eos> No, it wasn't.<eos> No, thank you, Zerk, that will suffice.<eos> Wha... what's... what...<eos> Ah, there he is.<eos> The infamous Sterling Archer, private eye.<eos> And I trust you know who I am?<eos> I do. But what do I call you?<eos> Mother will do.<eos> And so, you do know who I am, but you don't care?
But after that, vengeance will be mine.<eos> Oh, duh.<eos> Just like you always said, woodhouse,<eos> "lock the safe, Archer, you dumb twat."<eos> I wanted to get mixed up with mobsters like mother and Len Trexler about as much as I wanted a new hole in my head.<eos> But I meant it when I said I'd do anything to find Woodhouse's killer.<eos> Although, truth be told, I'd also do anything just to see Lana Kane again.<eos> So here I am, headed straight into the belly of the beast.<eos> Nothing between me and death but my wits and the cold, blue steel of my .45.<eos> I have no idea why I'm telling you all this.

So, first, maybe a drink.<eos> Or 12.<eos> Goddammit!<eos> Goddammit.<eos> Goddammit!<eos> Who the hell is this?<eos> Guess.<eos> I-I was just coming to see you.<eos> Oh, goody.<eos> Because I am just on pins and needles... well... to hear how you turned a stakeout into three dead, one crippled, and Len Trexler ready to go to war.
I wanted to be your friend.<eos> You're my friend.<eos> I'm going back to Mars.<eos> Goodbye, Miss Martian.<eos> So, our mystery alien is from Daxam.<eos> It's a sister world to Krypton.<eos> - May name is Mon-El.<eos> - Daxam is still there, but it's a wasteland.<eos> I wanna be a superhero.<eos> I wanna help you, keep the world spinning.
You betrayed me, my love.<eos> Thanks for stopping by, Mom.<eos> Welcome to New Daxam.<eos> It's Cat Grant.<eos> I've been away for a while, but I'm back.<eos> You really thought you'd won.<eos> Superman?<eos> This is my planet.<eos> These are my people.<eos> And I will not let you harm them.
Welcome to New Daxam.<eos> It's Cat Grant.<eos> I've been away for a while, but I'm back.<eos> You really thought you'd won.<eos> Superman?<eos> This is my planet.<eos> These are my people.<eos> And I will not let you harm them.<eos> What have you done to him?<eos> I once told you that my planet was riddled with the corpse of yours.
Silver Kryptonite.<eos> Your cousin is so much like you.<eos> Reckless, stupid.<eos> Barreling headfirst into danger.<eos> I couldn't have set a better trap if I tried.<eos> Kal?<eos> It's me, Kara!<eos> Oh, he doesn't see you.<eos> He sees his worst enemy.<eos> You should have stayed away, Zod.
But I was right.<eos> The threat was real.<eos> But maybe I backed the wrong child to stop it.<eos> The transmat portal you created...<eos> That was brilliant, Lena.<eos> And if you could do that with the portal, maybe you could do something with this.<eos> Is that from Lex's vault?<eos> He created it to get rid of Superman.<eos> Does it work?<eos> Well, you'd need to adapt it.
She's gonna end this.<eos> You just invoked a trial by combat created by barbarians!<eos> It's been around since we crawled out of the caves on Daxam with rocks and sticks.<eos> If I win, she goes.<eos> They all go.<eos> They are bound by ancient law to leave this planet in peace.<eos> - She's not gonna win.<eos> - But what if she does?<eos> Do you know what it will happen?<eos> You'll have to stand by and watch her walk this planet, trampling everyone underfoot.
It's being touted as the intergalactic fight of the century.<eos> As Supergirl and Rhea of Daxam face off in a trial by combat<eos> - for the very fate of our world.<eos> - Woof. No pressure.<eos> We need to contain this.<eos> Hey! Papa Bear!<eos> Easy!<eos> - It's good to see you on your feet.<eos> - Welcome, my friend.<eos> Should you be up and walking around?

Papa Bear!<eos> Easy!<eos> - It's good to see you on your feet.<eos> - Welcome, my friend.<eos> Should you be up and walking around?<eos> You need all the help you can get.
Hey! Papa Bear!<eos> Easy!<eos> - It's good to see you on your feet.<eos> - Welcome, my friend.<eos> Should you be up and walking around?<eos> You need all the help you can get.<eos> Alex told me about the offer you made.<eos> We'll get you everything you need.<eos> But for right now, that needs to be handled.<eos> You don't want an audience of innocent civilians when you fight Rhea.
He's been parading around like Darth Vader, punching out villains, and, I, for one, do not want to watch some space invaders slay him with their lifesaver.<eos> I think you mean "light saber".<eos> Yeah, and Darth Vader actually punches out the good guys.<eos> Right.<eos> Oh. Okay, whatever.<eos> I've never seen Star Wars.<eos> Oh, and Ker-rah, where the hell have you been?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You are ostensibly employed here as a reporter.<eos> And Supergirl is out there about to have the biggest skirmish of her career and I thought maybe you want to go out there and report?
Then, I put all my chips on the Girl of Steel.<eos> Now, you go out there and you tell Supergirl that we are all rooting for her.<eos> Sure thing.<eos> It's good seeing you, Ms. Grant.<eos> Oh, those big green eyes... I promise you, when he takes off those glasses, he is a tiger in bed.<eos> Oh, God, I hope Rhea kills me.<eos> Hey, you're never gonna guess who wants to see us.<eos> Of course, the two of you would make an entrance.<eos> Unfortunately, this is her on her best behavior.<eos> So what did you want?
You've made me so happy.<eos> Here, here.<eos> Take this.<eos> Take this.<eos> This will keep you safe.<eos> I love you.<eos> And I should have said it before.<eos> I love you.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> You have to go.
There was a moment this year...<eos> Where I felt completely broken.<eos> When I regretted a choice that changed my life.<eos> And then you forced your way into my home, wrapped your arms around me, and you said,<eos> "I'm proud of you."<eos> Didn't make me feel any better at the time, but it was something to hold onto.<eos> I am so proud of you.<eos> Do you...<eos> Do you want me to stay over tonight?<eos> I mean, I can be there as long as you need...
Do you want me to stay over tonight?<eos> I mean, I can be there as long as you need...<eos> No, no.<eos> Go be with your girlfriend.<eos> I need to know you two are happy.<eos> Like I want to know about Winn and Lyra,<eos> J'onn and M'gann, Clark and Lois.<eos> It's not like everybody else's world stopped.<eos> You don't have to act like it.<eos> What do you need right now?
She's summoned me to Washington, where she will greet me warmly, and then she'll fire me.<eos> There was a moment in time when the only two people who knew what it was to fly were the Wright Brothers.<eos> And we are like them in a way.<eos> Although we have to stay airborne a lot longer than nine seconds, we and have to go into much thinner air when we do.<eos> But how do you do it, Todd?<eos> How do you stay aloft?<eos> One of the nine poets, Pindar, said it best.<eos> Become who you are by learning who you are.<eos> You wouldn't know Pindar from Pantera, yet you act like you read the Harvard shelf with your morning oatmeal.<eos> Who wrote this shit for you?
Okay, okay, okay, I'm only the referee here, not taking sides, but you overstepped.<eos> Apologies.<eos> And let that be the first apology, not the last, to this audience, who have paid three grand for the privilege of hearing your barbaric yawp.<eos> - Axe, Axe, Axe.<eos> - Here's a thought.<eos> If any of you want to continue the conversation, I'll be over by the bar with my team.<eos> Sure... hit, run, and hide?<eos> You been showing the SEC the same moves for years.<eos> But, eventually, they catch you.<eos> Krakow, whatever cocktail party tutor you used to prep you for this panel owes you a goddamn refund.
Sure... hit, run, and hide?<eos> You been showing the SEC the same moves for years.<eos> But, eventually, they catch you.<eos> Krakow, whatever cocktail party tutor you used to prep you for this panel owes you a goddamn refund.<eos> Well, that was stimulating.<eos> Okay, okay, let's move on.<eos> Tag, Global warming...<eos> I called the car around so you can go.<eos> Why would I leave now?<eos> That's what you get for trying to steal my fucking employees.
That's why the papers think it's such a good story.<eos> And there's the Axelrod case.<eos> - We never even brought charges.<eos> - That's good.<eos> You're protected by qualified immunity.<eos> Chances are, we get it thrown out of court.<eos> That will depend on the judge.<eos> We gotta find a very...<eos> Chuck, I'm gonna make this go away.<eos> That's why you came to me instead of going with whatever lawyer Justice gave you.

They only do that when...<eos> Well, they never really do that.<eos> No.<eos> Well, I'm not billing you.
- He's hounding me now.<eos> - What about these lawsuits?<eos> Were you gonna tell me about them?<eos> Why did I have to read about it in the Times?<eos> Nuisance suits.<eos> Minor distraction.<eos> Didn't rate a discussion.<eos> This investigator...<eos> Oliver Dake.<eos> Yeah, well, I told you about him.
I am interested in you becoming a goddamn giant-killer.<eos> Do you want to be a giant-killer, Ben?<eos> Sure.<eos> What the fuck are you trying to say?<eos> ! Yes.<eos> I want to kill giants.<eos> There ya go!<eos> There you go.<eos> I thought we were gonna talk about the path from analyst to portfolio manager.<eos> That is all we are talking about, and you are a long way from making the trek up that path.
Is that what Connerty thinks, or is that what he wants you to think?<eos> I'm hearing that multiple former AUSAs are gonna come forward against you.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Who?<eos> No names yet.<eos> The claim is that you were capricious, that, you expected them to use intimidation to get settlements.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> Well, this gives the case teeth.<eos> There's no way a judge is gonna throw it out now.<eos> As your lawyer, I gotta advise you to consider the idea of a settlement.
No. I won't settle.<eos> Can't.<eos> No, any appearance of guilt puts everything at risk.<eos> Every conviction my office has ever made would be in question.<eos> No. Well, you can't afford to think in absolutes.<eos> I'm gonna fight this all the way to a trial if it comes to it.<eos> Buddy, you gotta understand.<eos> One hundred and twenty seven cases, if you're found liable even for a portion of them, it could bankrupt you.<eos> So if this gets sticky, how big is your trust, how bulletproof is it?<eos> You might... You might want to think - about going offshore with it.
What's going on, Bryan?<eos> I think we're doing our best with what we've been given.<eos> Well, seems to me you're a step slow.<eos> It's a big challenge, an expansion of our moral mission.<eos> Normally, I'd expect you'd tear into a piece of red meat like that.<eos> It just takes time.<eos> I'll have something by tomorrow.<eos> By end of day today.<eos> Right.<eos> You're in D. C. Tomorrow.

So my guy likes to get his beak wet...<eos> Let's stay on point.<eos> Anata-Tek is a company with no tech.<eos> Just as Taylor anticipated.<eos> She spotted that from outer space?<eos> Not she.<eos> They.<eos> Get it hard, keep it hard, use it!<eos> He hasn't fucked his woman in six months.<eos> Should you... be sharing that?
Do you want to make a statement?<eos> No.<eos> I've said enough.<eos> Congratulations on rooting this out.<eos> A very good day for us.<eos> Thank you for backing the idea.<eos> - It really means a lot.<eos> - What do you care?<eos> I know you already turned down a job here.<eos> There's nothing on the line for you, so what do you care?
Thank you for backing the idea.<eos> - It really means a lot.<eos> - What do you care?<eos> I know you already turned down a job here.<eos> There's nothing on the line for you, so what do you care?<eos> I just like being right.<eos> No.<eos> There's something else.<eos> You were testing me, and you still are.<eos> You wanted to know if I could see you, behind Mafee, see what you saw.
Fama's an egghead.<eos> Get an education right here.<eos> Make it a million a year.<eos> What?<eos> Three seventy-five or 750 or a million, it's all the same to you?<eos> It's an abstraction?<eos> I don't know if you can understand... maybe me being the way I am, but just breathing the air here can be discomforting.<eos> The air is thinner.<eos> Nah.<eos> You don't belong here.
- How do you feel about football?<eos> - Which team?<eos> Not sure yet, but a franchise is talking to bankers about putting itself on the block.<eos> Good. Go further.<eos> Nice.<eos> Axe?<eos> Can I help you, Todd?<eos> How many hours did you spend obsessing over my positions?<eos> It paid for itself.<eos> Or, rather, you paid for it.
To think that real relationships are possible in such a cauldron.<eos> I didn't count on that.<eos> But I guess I did count on a shared mission.<eos> Yet you stay.<eos> Yet you're loyal to Rhoades.<eos> I can't claim the moral high ground anymore.<eos> The Crim job.<eos> If I'm this conflicted now...<eos> There's never been a leader of any merit who was free of those doubts.<eos> But you can't stop now.
It's Mike Wagner.<eos> Axe Capital.<eos> Apologies for the disrespect.<eos> Sorry you saw that.<eos> It was a bit too revealing.<eos> Yeah, it was.<eos> I loved it.<eos> That is passion, man.<eos> When are you and I gonna go a few rounds?<eos> Let me tell you an open secret.
You squared off with him, walked away unmarked.<eos> I need your playbook, I need to know how to beat him.<eos> Will you help me?<eos> I don't remember your reassuring hand on my shoulder when it was my time of trouble.<eos> What I do remember is you, the exemplar of Wall Street rectitude, steering clear and making damn certain that my stink didn't waft anywhere near you, lest it stick.<eos> Now, before I decide, answer this.<eos> Are you a bastard?<eos> Because for you to have a chance against Rhoades, you need to be.<eos> Even though there will be lawyers, there are no fucking rules... not if you want to win.<eos> You will have to crawl through a river of shit and risk bleeding out a hundred yards short of victory.
But wait a minute.<eos> Isn't it your job to know where Cristian is?<eos> It's not her job.<eos> That's what we're trying to do here.<eos> But maybe you could help us by giving us a list of Cristian's old friends or people he held grudges against or people he hated.<eos> Chief.<eos> We thought you were at the leadership conference in Charlotte.<eos> After the cemetery bombing yesterday, Chief Pope called me back and sent Winnie Davis in my place.<eos> Are we to read anything into that?<eos> Maybe you won't be directing traffic in San Pedro after all.
Does the partial belong to Ortiz?<eos> - Let's take a look.<eos> - I'll check with my boss.<eos> But Wilks' information has to be good!<eos> We will make sure he knows that!<eos> Mom?<eos> She talks tough, but she's already drawn up the paperwork reducing the guy's sentence by three years. Just so you know.<eos> Hey, Provenza.<eos> I've been doing some thinking.<eos> - Are you in pain?
- Are you in pain?<eos> - No, I... Very funny.<eos> N-no, I figure since my health has been pretty much on track...<eos> I'm eating better, I'm exercising, vitamins...<eos> So how long before I... I-I'm back in the field?<eos> Flynn, you have had two big health scares in a row.<eos> Now, getting you off of desk duty creates huge liability issues here.<eos> And returning to the field?<eos> Well...<eos> You need the right person to be promoted to Assistant Chief.
And despite Napa being,<eos> - the best job I can get right now.<eos> - But I...<eos> I can't believe I'm saying this. I...<eos> Napa's great, and I totally get what it means to you.<eos> But what about us?<eos> Well, this is not a "What about us?" thing.<eos> Because "us" could be living in Napa.<eos> "Us" could be living in Oakland.<eos> This is an "all about you wanting to stay here" thing.
But I'm guessing that's because of everything you did for his sister.<eos> Why else let a needy boy like you call all the shots when he could be doing so much better?<eos> Like being with you?<eos> That's why you're promoting him to Napa, isn't it?<eos> Instead of here?<eos> Or did the two-star Michelin chef that you hired just refuse to enter his kitchen unless Gus was there as his new right hand?<eos> Are you really upset with me, or... or because you... you found someone that you can't buy?<eos> Well...<eos> I hear you know all about that.<eos> Hey, why don't you tell Gus that it's not all his hard work or talent that I'm rewarding?
Your kingdom.<eos> Your throne.<eos> Burn them.<eos> And ban the snow from falling.<eos> I will have nothing white in England.<eos> Where are my rooms?<eos> The king's rooms, Henry.<eos> I have dreamed of this my entire life.<eos> You always said God had chosen me.<eos> You have always known His will.
forgive me, Your Grace, that you are a Welshman who's lived your life in France and does not even know our customs.<eos> Take another as your mistress.<eos> Take anyone you choose.<eos> But they insist you marry Princess Elizabeth as you have sworn to do.<eos> Henry?<eos> I have prayed upon this.<eos> Perhaps this is the sacrifice that God would have you make.<eos> Jesus suffered in the desert and when they crucified him.<eos> It is divine to suffer and you have more divinity than any man on Earth.<eos> God asks for this, and in return, he gives you England.
God asks for this, and in return, he gives you England.<eos> Parliament have said that he must marry you.<eos> I was right then, that he does not want to.<eos> How do you know that they have said that?<eos> Princess Elizabeth?<eos> The king will see you in his private rooms tonight alone.<eos> We are not married, I cannot.<eos> My daughter thanks His Grace and is delighted to attend.<eos> Go, Lizzie.<eos> Perhaps you may yet grow to like him.
He will only marry her if she conceives a child.<eos> Well, they are intimate already?<eos> We have to know if she's fertile.<eos> He's bid me search the Tower for the bodies of the York princes.<eos> While there's no proof that they are dead, rumors persist and fuel rebellions.<eos> I will do it.<eos> I need to earn his trust.<eos> Princess Elizabeth? - This way.<eos> - Why?<eos> You are lucky in your looks, just like your mother.
You are lucky in your looks, just like your mother.<eos> You will have handsome children.<eos> I suppose you are still vain in your appearance though.<eos> I wish to speak to you as a friend.<eos> We continue to be at odds with one another and... I regret it.<eos> I am to be your mother-in-law and you will find when you come to know me that I have great love to give, and that I have a talent for loyalty.<eos> When I was a little girl... I was called upon to give birth to Henry.<eos> Now, I knew he would be King of England and I would put him on the throne.<eos> When I met you, I knew that you had a destiny to bear his son.<eos> That is why I was hard on you, why I was so furious when I saw you straying from your path and fighting against your calling.
You think I have a calling?<eos> You will be mother to the King of England.<eos> A boy who is the red rose and white combined.<eos> You will be the peace that ends the cousins' war.<eos> And God himself will call you blessed.<eos> You may now go to my son's rooms and do your duty.<eos> So, Lizzie has a king to wed, but what about the rest of us?<eos> Who's king? Is it me?<eos> No, Teddy.<eos> You mustn't say it.
And did they?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Who gave the order?<eos> My Lady, the King's Mother.<eos> God save the king!<eos> God save the king.<eos> What have you got there, Maggie?<eos> Lizzie asked me to fetch it for her.<eos> For her belly pain.<eos> Maggie brought this for you.
Something's out there.<eos> You headed home?<eos> Gonna spend the rest of your night reading The Ladder in your room?<eos>  No.<eos>  Be easy, Hawk.<eos>  Can I come with you?<eos>  Taking control of your life?<eos>  Trying.<eos>  That smell.<eos> You can't understand how wonderful it is.
 But you can't appreciate it until you've been away like I have.<eos> Someplace so cold and forbidding, so utterly devoid of life, you can't know how precious it is, how vulnerable.<eos> Rabbits.<eos> Shame.<eos>  If we're gonna discuss Cal, should we go somewhere more private?<eos>  I don't think we're the ones who should be hiding.<eos>  Cal could have written the rungs, but I struggle to believe he's capable of harming Steve.<eos> The man was a father to him.<eos>  We could live a thousand lives and still never find bottom in the sea of human cruelty.<eos>  You make pronouncements like that.
I mean, I did it.<eos>  I promise you, I did not have anyone follow you, Eddie.<eos> How long are they keeping you here?<eos>  Till they think I'm fit to leave, I guess.<eos>  What are they doing for you?<eos>  Just tests, meds, I don't know yet.<eos>  They don't know what's wrong with you.<eos>  Sarah.<eos>  They don't know your Damage.<eos> They don't know how to help you.

We had a complicated relationship.<eos>  Yeah.<eos>  Anyway, I was feeling so low, and Steve, he took me into this little room, and he showed me how to paint flowers on my walls of doom.<eos>  I wish I learned how to do that when I was a kid.<eos>  You're doing it now.<eos>  Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Listen, I got to go catch a bus.<eos>  Yeah, yeah, have a great evening?<eos>  You too.  All right.
 I don't know.<eos> But what you're suggesting goes against everything we believe in.<eos>  Spare me the sanctimony, Cal.<eos> What you've done goes way beyond<eos>  Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> And once you start down that road, you can't get back.<eos>  I'm already down that road!<eos> I was down it the moment we buried Silas' body back in the ground.<eos>  But this isn't who you are.<eos>  No, you don't get to tell me who I am.
Do not have Eddie followed again.<eos> Leave him alone.<eos>  All right, Eddie, this one, you're supposed to take with food.<eos> Eddie?<eos> Hello, Earth to Eddie.<eos>  Yeah, with food, right.<eos>  Where'd you go?<eos>  I'm just tired, Chloe.<eos>  Yeah, of course.<eos> Why don't you let me make you some soup or something?
 All right, Eddie, this one, you're supposed to take with food.<eos> Eddie?<eos> Hello, Earth to Eddie.<eos>  Yeah, with food, right.<eos>  Where'd you go?<eos>  I'm just tired, Chloe.<eos>  Yeah, of course.<eos> Why don't you let me make you some soup or something?<eos>  I'm fine.<eos> Why don't you just go on home, and I will call you tomorrow.
 I'm saying that maybe you feel guilty that you couldn't save my brother, so now you feel like you have to try and save me.<eos>  No, Eddie, no.<eos> That is not true.<eos>  God.<eos>  Yeah, you're right.<eos> You're right, I couldn't save Johnny.<eos> I was a teenager, and he was depressed.<eos> But Johnny never had a shot, because he wasn't brave enough to get help.<eos> But you are.<eos> You are brave enough to leave the Meyerists, and you're brave enough to try to live in the real world.
You want to save yourself.<eos> You do.<eos> You want to save yourself, or you wouldn't even be here right now.<eos>  Welcome, Ms. Jackson.<eos> You can just park right up here.<eos> Someone will take you to your meeting.<eos>  Kodiak.<eos>  I was hoping we'd cross paths this morning.<eos>  Great, good.<eos>  Can I show you something?
But it's not a burden.<eos> It's a blessing, to have been entrusted.<eos>  None of us is beyond unburdening.<eos>  Yeah, that's right.<eos> That's what we teach.<eos> See you at dinner.<eos>  Shadows grow long.<eos> The night is only beginning.<eos>  Nice shirt.<eos>  Yeah, I got you one too.
 What, is it working?<eos>  Yeah.<eos> Thank you for coming in, Lisa.<eos>  What was that?<eos>  Device is no longer transmitting.<eos>  Well, what happened?<eos> Where's the ask?<eos>  She didn't ask for anything, offer anything in return, or present a threat to her reputation or wellbeing.<eos>  So we have nothing.<eos>  What do you want?
 So you left me at a club.<eos>  Listening to great music, remembering the love of your life.<eos> I'm in a bad mood.<eos> Everyone's about to find out who they think I am.<eos>  How?<eos>  My mother just did her thing that she does, her golden handcuffs, just in case I thought I could escape and be my own person.<eos> Nope, she makes it known that I am hers and always will be.<eos>  I don't get it.<eos>  Yeah, you do.<eos> You can't change who your parents are.
 There's someone among us?<eos> Working for them?<eos> That place, those people... that was my whole life, my whole world.<eos> But I couldn't stay.<eos> I couldn't keep living with that fear.<eos> I was so scared every minute, every day.<eos> Then, finally, I say, "I want to leave."<eos> And the leader we called him Father.<eos> Father says to me, "You can't leave,<eos> "because even if you do, I'll come to you in your dreams."
- In Napa, yeah.<eos> Well, he just lost his sous chef up there and he wants me to replace him. I-I-I-I haven't said yes to him yet.<eos> You can't go to Napa.<eos> I'm a year out from my degree.<eos> I... You can transfer to Berkeley.<eos> I-I checked it out, and Berkeley has one of the top law schools in the country.<eos> And you have a much better shot of getting accepted there as a Berkeley undergrad.<eos> I'll commute to work from Oakland.<eos> It's 40 minutes.<eos> And you don't have to answer right now, but Aiden's flying me to Napa tomorrow afternoon.
I think I have a crush on...<eos> I think I have a crush on Karen.<eos> You have a...<eos> Karen?<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Excuse me, are you messing with us?<eos> What makes you think that?<eos> So this is just some creepy thing that you do, dude? Come on. Just leave us alone, okay?<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Why don't you just go be a creep somewhere else, okay?
Cristian Ortiz claimed he was innocent after he took a deal?<eos> Trying to be better bad guys.<eos> And I mean, hey, I'm clearly, you know, morally open-minded, but even I'm not interested in how to get away with murder.<eos> And another thing about Cristian was his wife, Liseth.<eos> She cheated on him.<eos> And yo, I caught him at the tail end of 11 years. 11 years, and he still hadn't let that go.<eos> He blamed her for everything that happened.<eos> Now... on that note, I stop talking for a little bit.<eos> You don't wanna do that, Lewis.<eos> We can get you things.

We're gonna save him.<eos> Look, I-I have to go.<eos> You should just... just... just... you should come.<eos> Why did you tell her that?<eos> You shouldn't say that.<eos> Alex and I are separated, okay?<eos> We're not together.<eos> We weren't together.<eos> But you and me... that could be a huge conflict of interest.<eos> Maybe you should pass this case off.
Let's stick to that.<eos> Fine.<eos> But my primary interest here is in protecting the hospital, not your medical licenses.<eos> If I don't have the whole picture, you're on your own.<eos> Fine.<eos> Don't worry, Maggie, just... focus on the medicine.<eos> Yeah, there's a problem there.<eos> When you signed off on the surgery, you didn't have the full picture, either.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Alex told you that we reversed Bree's blood thinners.
She was going septic.<eos> Alex knew you wouldn't okay a surgery if you knew...<eos> So she lied about the blood work?<eos> She's not in a coma because of the blood thinners.<eos> That doesn't matter, Maggie.<eos> 'Cause if she doesn't wake up... you and Alex... you're finished here.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> In a second, darling.<eos> Mom... you're sick.<eos> Shahir tried to explain it to you, but your memory has been compromised because of a disease.
Then let's figure this out.<eos> Blood thinners were administered at 3:00.<eos> An hour later, Miss Hannigan is rushed to the O.R.<eos> Yes, because she had a bowel obstruction.<eos> Weren't you worried that she'd bleed out on the table?<eos> Of course I was, but we were prepared for that.<eos> Were you prepared for any of the other catastrophes that might have happened with blood thinners in her system?<eos> What is keeping you here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe you like it.
"whatever the outcome."<eos> I see an aspiring art student.<eos> I see...<eos> I see a hopeless romantic.<eos> And I see a survivor.<eos> You can do this, Bree.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> You just need to wake up... and keep fighting.<eos> I don't have anyone.<eos> You don't need anyone.
It's okay.<eos> I'll go.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> This is on me.<eos> It should be me.<eos> So, the licensing board has ruled in favor of Hope Zion.<eos> Yeah, I heard.<eos> And...<eos> I bought you this.
Can you imagine having a baby in Georgia?<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> You have to pick someone you know that you trust.<eos> Why don't you use Gary's sperm?<eos> It's just sitting there gathering dust.<eos> I mean, if it came to that.<eos> God, I wish there were some way we could do this without men.<eos> - No offense.<eos> - None taken.<eos> Okay, I can't look at you, Cape Fear, until Gary gets you a shirt.
- And only case of schizophrenia, but my uncle-grandpa had her sterilized, and we are all good...<eos> Now he's just going on and on for no apparent reason.<eos> Listen, honey, I want you to tell your whore of a father that I fired the art skank.<eos> - Well, I'm not gonna tell him you said that, but I am really sorry that Dad did this to you.<eos> That is just the sweetest thing.<eos> We're just one big, happy family!<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You know what I'm thinking?<eos> Maybe... maybe this isn't a good time for you to get pregnant.
- This is my friend Dan, - who is just leaving.<eos> - Oh, what are you doing?<eos> Oh, shit, she can see.<eos> That's a shocker.<eos> Oh, wow!<eos> You're Danny.<eos> I watch you when I'm on the treadmill.<eos> - Of course you work out.<eos> - It's just Dan.<eos> And let me give you one word of advice... run.
You're gonna, you're gonna interrogate them, too, though?<eos> Yeah?<eos> I'll ask the questions here, you don't mind.<eos> So what happened between you and Chester, anyway?<eos> I grew up.<eos> He found out about my nature and threw me out.<eos> Now, you people, you like little boys, too, don't ya?<eos> "You people"?<eos> I thought you was my people.<eos> I like little boys as much as you like little girls... brotha.
But maybe he's still out there.<eos> The only thing I can hope is that he come home again.<eos> Well, you guys take care of yourself now.<eos> - And thank you for what you did.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> Stop by the shop, and I'll give you a free haircut.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Thank you, Stella.<eos> - No, I mean it.<eos> You need a haircut.
Now they sure do make a good couple.<eos> Well, he's just bein' a gentleman.<eos> Leonard, this is Clayton.<eos> Ivan's dad.<eos> Do my best to bring him up.<eos> This is what I get.<eos> He's got his mama ways.<eos> She left him when he was little.<eos> He's just like her.<eos> Let me give you a little somethin' for your trouble, - all right?
That's my dad.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I decided to go home.<eos> I know that, too.<eos> Come on, boy. Let's go.<eos> I finished it.<eos> It's good.<eos> Hey...<eos> Hey.<eos> You remember what I told you now, ya hear?
What can I do for you?<eos> We need to talk.<eos> You two knuckleheads really are somethin'.<eos> Just tell us what happened to the red shoes.<eos> You can do that, can't ya?<eos> Look...<eos> I'm already on administrative leave for shootin' that boy.<eos> Half salary.<eos> Hanson catch me talkin' to you, I'll be a rent-a-cop faster'n I can burn these hamburgers.<eos> Well, you... you help us solve BB's murder, you'll get your job back.
That boy should've never picked up that shotgun.<eos> That boy should've never been black.<eos> Had he been white, he'd have been at the hospital with a hole in his knee.<eos> You'd be at the bar, laughing' it up, instead of at home, cryin' in your beer.<eos> Look, why is everybody so eager to lump BB's murder with the rest of these boys?<eos> And don't you say it's a black thing.<eos> Yeah, are you seriously gonna let Hanson just brush this under the carpet?<eos> Charlie, you came to see me about the shoes.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> Not because you didn't care, but because you knew somethin' was goin' on inside the Sheriff's Department, and you couldn't live with it.
That preacher, he didn't kill your son.<eos> What are you sayin'?<eos> Goddamn it.<eos> What the hell are you sayin'?<eos> Until two minutes ago, we thought you did it.<eos> Who the hell would want to kill my boy?<eos> What reason would anyone have to kill that kid?<eos> Everyone loved that kid.<eos> Everyone.<eos> What? What? What do you want, Beau?
Who the hell would want to kill my boy?<eos> What reason would anyone have to kill that kid?<eos> Everyone loved that kid.<eos> Everyone.<eos> What? What? What do you want, Beau?<eos> Um, it's almost time for the fireworks.<eos> What are them two doin' here?<eos> What have you done, Beau?<eos> I didn't do nothin', Daddy.<eos> What are they tellin' you?
I want the truth or I'll skin you alive.<eos> I want the truth.<eos> You hear me? !<eos> - Well, I...<eos> - Why? !<eos> Why?<eos> That's enough!<eos> The way you doted on him!<eos> And you treated me like I was less.<eos> He never did nothin' to you!
Isn't she just a darling?<eos> I do hope I can count on yo vote.<eos> If you knew who I was, you'd know better than to hold out. Any hope or that fat mitt of yours.<eos> Books!<eos> Books!<eos> Books!<eos> - You want a book?<eos> Hey! Take that voodoo shit and go on from around me!<eos> You hear? !<eos> You like cowboys?
Who the hell do you think you are?<eos> I'm a constituent with a burning legal question for a public servant.<eos> After you killed me and Leonard's fathers, How much did your daddy have to pay to make it all go away?<eos> I'm sorry for your loss, but the past is the past.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm inclined to agree with you there.<eos> The past should stay in the past.<eos> And it would be a terrible thing if all of this would come out now, this being an election year and all.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Leonard Pine sleeps in his own bed tonight.<eos> We think it might be a good idea if you got out of town, Lay low until all this blows over.
What do you want?<eos> Leonard Pine sleeps in his own bed tonight.<eos> We think it might be a good idea if you got out of town, Lay low until all this blows over.<eos> You and mommy here decide that together?<eos> I-I have a cousin in Abilene.<eos> I spoke to him already.<eos> He said you could stay there as long as you want.<eos> I don't walk fast for nothing, sugar..<eos> Let me be clear here.<eos> As your Attorney, I cannot advise you to break the law.
He's the Ringleader.<eos> - You kill all of 'em? - Never kill 'em.<eos> Find 'em dead and lookin' sad.<eos> Make me feel good to see 'em back on their feet again.<eos> This here is Janet.<eos> She lived in my pond.<eos> Ain't many birds like this left in these parts.<eos> She my real lucky charm.<eos> When she died, part of me went with her.<eos> That boy haunting' you would serve you right.
I met their mamas.<eos> All them lost children.<eos> Chester convinced, Must be something connecting them all together.<eos> All of us trying to add it all up.<eos> Come down to the end of it.<eos> Don't add up to nothing.<eos> I wouldn't say nothing.<eos> There you are, BB.<eos> Boy, where the hell you been? Out.<eos> I ain't takin' no lip off you, boy.
Can't nothin' them cops do that florida can't undo.<eos> You might as well sit still till she come here.<eos> I tell you, memaw. It was easier for me being black in vietnam. Than it is in my own damn country.<eos> Now why you think chester paid. For that girl to go to school?<eos> So she could learn to fight the white man like a white man, In they courts.<eos> Old chester paid for florida's law school. After he kicked me out?<eos> I'll be damned.<eos> Now, honey, if you gon' blame a dead man. For the way things turned out, you might as well turn in.<eos> You and leonard need to go talk to illium.<eos> I know I told you yesterday that he'd do the right thing.
Leonard pine pays.<eos> Hap collins pays.<eos> You.<eos> Me. My son.<eos> Even the innocent we can't really protect.<eos> Well...<eos> Y'all be careful?<eos> Surefire way to get your pecker blown off.<eos> How'd you get in here?<eos> Boy, didn't nobody tell you?
Surefire way to get your pecker blown off.<eos> How'd you get in here?<eos> Boy, didn't nobody tell you?<eos> Ain't safe to leave your door open in a white neighborhood.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Salt increases the, conductivity.<eos> So when you go... You go real quick.<eos> You gon' go.<eos> Where's ivan?<eos> Valentine tell you to snatch him?
Look down.<eos> See all those fools down there?<eos> You and me, we ain't nothin' like them, hap.<eos> I love you, man.<eos> Love you, too, hap.<eos> Collins.<eos> Your turn on the dance floor.<eos> Wake up, asshole.<eos> Get dressed.<eos> You're lucky.
See, here in east texas, Man needs a plan. Otherwise, there's just nothing here for him.<eos> Except for trouble, of course.<eos> Are you a troublemaker, collins?<eos> Depends on who you ask. I'm asking you.<eos> Yeah, I guess I am.<eos> My son beau is a slothful, lazy, ignorant son of a bitch, But he is gonna be my next county judge, Because that's what I need him to be,<eos> Although I gotta say, I would have enjoyed seeing him. Piss himself last night.<eos> It wasn't as much fun as you might imagine.<eos> This is all about what happened to your daddy, isn't it?<eos> Son, lookin' backwards ain't gonna get you outta this office, And it ain't gonna help your friend leonard pine either.
He's a criminal, and he's in your head, man.<eos> Let me know when it's done.<eos> 204 is ready.<eos> Right. The crematorium.<eos> The hell we just see?<eos> Partner, we were never here.<eos> You gon' forget what you just saw.<eos> We both are. Understand?<eos> You sure you wanna scrap that? Why?<eos> You want it?
You gon' forget what you just saw.<eos> We both are. Understand?<eos> You sure you wanna scrap that? Why?<eos> You want it?<eos> My second cousin, ferdinand, Got this auction house over in dallas.-<eos> He is always selling' that kind of stuff to these arty farts.<eos> I could check with him. Why?<eos> How much you think it's worth?<eos> Depends on where it's been, Who made it, how many of 'em there are.<eos> But I tell you what.
Mama's gettin' a brand-new pair of shoes!<eos> Collins.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You box?<eos> Well... Little bit.<eos> How 'bout a round or two for charity, Show these folks how men do it? Yeah!<eos> Please don't.<eos> You think I'm gon' embarrass you, counselor?<eos> I think you're gonna embarrass yourself.<eos> So you do care.
Why?<eos> On account of me and Hap got something to do.<eos> I won't be in your way.<eos> Boy, you ain't goin' nowhere near that carnival.<eos> Not today.<eos> MeMaw, it's okay he stay here one more day?<eos> Well...<eos> He is a pot full of trouble.<eos> I'm so bored.<eos> You read that book I gave you?
Nice.<eos> I tell you, Hap. You see anybody around here that don't look like a damn serial killer?<eos> 'Sides that horse?<eos> Hap Collins!<eos> Shit!<eos> Hey, Leonard.<eos> - How's it hangin'?<eos> - To the left.<eos> You boys still goin' steady?<eos> You ain't get the weddin' invitation?
Just keep piling' on.<eos> Keep it movin'.<eos> 13 stripes.<eos> - Just like I told you. - Right.<eos> We need your help, Judy.<eos> Sweetie, if you're here, you're well beyond help.<eos> But okay.<eos> Shoot.<eos> Well, we're looking for someone who might be a little... freaky.<eos> I'm not enough for you, Hap?
That's everythin' I could find.<eos> No, this is great, Judy.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Unsnap me, would ya?<eos> I gotta get ready for work.<eos> You're a contortionist, Judy.<eos> You really need unsnappin'?<eos> Happy.<eos> You've seen my tits before.<eos> I'm showin' you my boobs, and you're not even lookin'.
- I like that, boy.<eos> - All right, now!<eos> Okay.<eos> All right. Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> One day at a time, now.<eos> All right.<eos> You don't like your book?<eos> I'd rather be outside.<eos> Why you think Leonard gave you that book in the first place?
All right.<eos> You don't like your book?<eos> I'd rather be outside.<eos> Why you think Leonard gave you that book in the first place?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Punishment?<eos> He knew you were tryin' to change your life.<eos> And... and that book, it's kinda like a Bible.<eos> See, every mistake you ever thought about makin',<eos> Huckleberry Finn already made it fo' you so you don't have to do it.

You need some gas?<eos> Yes, actually.<eos> - Fill her up?<eos> - Yes, thank you.<eos> Don't touch anything.<eos> Well, well.<eos> What have we here?<eos> Put an APB out on Collins.<eos> I'm sure there's an explanation.<eos> I'm sure you'd like to think so.
Florida!<eos> This place is crawlin' with cops, in case you haven't noticed.<eos> Well, that's good 'cause I've been tryin' to call 'em.<eos> - They're here to arrest you, Hap.<eos> - What?<eos> Come on.<eos> What the hell is goin' on?<eos> They found your room at Fernie's with Chester's stuff in it.<eos> They think you killed that boy.<eos> I mean, what were you doin' with all that stuff anyway?
The after-life even more so.<eos> Which is why we invent these games to fill the void of existence.<eos> Who diddled whom.<eos> Who'll get revenge for it.<eos> Who takes the throne.<eos> Yeah, well, that would be me, actually, and my friends.<eos> Ah, well, I doubt they're your friends anymore.<eos> And, uh, they won't be royals long. Huh.<eos> Why?<eos> Uh, maybe you could use a bit of help with the Binding Principle.
As soon as I'm finished with this, I'm ready.<eos> He knows you.<eos> A bit too intimately.<eos> No, I have the perfect fresh candidate.<eos> She's young, beautiful, female, and a very powerful witch.<eos> No.<eos> - Julia.<eos> - Let's skip the discussion.<eos> You do as I say or this... does its job, per the bond.<eos> Oh, well, technically, the Leo Blade cuts my throat if I attempt to harm you, your beloveds, or undermine your efforts.
That makes no sense.<eos> I used the go-to fermenting enchantment.<eos> No fretting.<eos> I'll get it right.<eos> Trial and error.<eos> I'm your wife.<eos> I want to be obedient.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Nobody wants to be obedient.<eos> I do want to serve you and Fillory, but...
If I'm wrong, raise your hand.<eos> Look, you're right.<eos> It was wrong grabbing you the way that we did, but sooner or later, he was gonna find you.<eos> - We need someone...<eos> - Else, Julia.<eos> Or we have a problem.<eos> Do you want a problem with me?<eos> - Forget it.<eos> - Great.<eos> I told you untying her was a mistake.
Oh. Well, if it's, like, where to find her?<eos> "Island made of streets" is Rhode Island.<eos> What?<eos> Duh.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Could you spell your last name again?<eos> I would, but... you're asleep.<eos> You said anything.<eos> But this is... this is...<eos> Am I not enough for you?
I would, but... you're asleep.<eos> You said anything.<eos> But this is... this is...<eos> Am I not enough for you?<eos> You're great.<eos> For... who you are.<eos> It's just... I already told you.<eos> My life was different before.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I'll help you make a new life.
I see you still don't expend much on good manners.<eos> What, this is a charm school now?<eos> No, but it is my school.<eos> Not a safe house.<eos> I was the best student you ever had here.<eos> You said that.<eos> I confused talent with character.<eos> You need both to be a true magician, Marina.<eos> Kicking you out wasn't a choice.<eos> I couldn't have you infecting my students then and I certainly won't now.

I'm not as strong as I was.<eos> By the time I'm fully powered up,<eos> The Beast will have eaten all of our faces off.<eos> You all are going to need something strong to hit him with.<eos> Bigby isn't the only one who tucked away a few secrets.<eos> - Ah, ow! - Sorry.<eos> The spell says it has to be tight.<eos> Do they have to be behind me?<eos> I feel like I'm getting busted.<eos> You can't look at your hands for 12 hours.
I don't think you're in a position to do much.<eos> Try me.<eos> I might.<eos> After you graduate.<eos> - Jules.<eos> - Q, hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> I-I got your message in my bathroom mirror.<eos> It was freaky.<eos> Look, um, I'm not supposed to tell you what I'm gonna tell you.
You could die if you don't get clear of The Beast.<eos> You think I don't know how dangerous he is?<eos> No, not him.<eos> Us.<eos> We're going to kill him.<eos> Do what you want with him but not until I get Reynard.<eos> No, we can't wait.<eos> - You won't...<eos> - No, Jules, we can't.<eos> I-I know that you're hurting.
Mildly helpful, I guess.<eos> It's all I got.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sure.<eos> This is...<eos> I know.<eos> Okay, I'll see you when I see you.<eos> See you.<eos> Wow.<eos> I owe you for real.
It sounds like a lot of effort.<eos> We could get high.<eos> Sold!<eos> To the lady in the back with nine fingertips.<eos> That was mean.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You're so sensitive when you're sober.<eos> Well, it's a disability.<eos> You shouldn't make fun of it.<eos> Maybe we could get you one of those license plates for retards that let you park anywhere.
It is not.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Hey, yo!<eos> They got Janae and Abdullah.<eos> We gotta go.<eos> Well, she's not...<eos> Her breathing, it's, like, off, man.<eos> All right, move.<eos> Hey, Suzanne.<eos> Yo! You gotta wake up, yo.
At least, not in the near future.<eos> Or distant future.<eos> Maybe way, way in the future.<eos> Except we won't be cute no more.<eos> That ain't never gonna be us.<eos> I hate this stupid fucking riot.<eos> Come on, we made such cool shit.<eos> But it was a taste of, like, being normal.<eos> It's better when you forget there's a whole world outside of this place.<eos> And then maybe you don't feel so bad.
I'm with you.<eos> Shit, you're strong.<eos> No! Those are...<eos> Those are mine!<eos> No!<eos> Come on, let's go!<eos> Move faster!<eos> Thank God you're here.<eos> You've gotta help me.<eos> Get your ass against the wall or I'mma shoot you in the face.
We made it.<eos> Fuck, no.<eos> I see what you're doing.<eos> I'm not going through that door.<eos> Whoever goes through that door, gets shot by whatever cop amped up on shitty coffee and testosterone is waiting out there.<eos> You a real pussy, you know that?<eos> It's hot.<eos> Thank you?<eos> No one's out there, you dumbass.<eos> Told you.
- Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, I'm okay.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Can I?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hi, mami! Hi!<eos> Hi, baby girl!<eos> Oh, God!<eos> - Oh, I missed you so much, baby.
- I had to make sure you're okay, right? - Oh!<eos> Where's Lorna?<eos> Is she okay?<eos> Um...<eos> I think so.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We got some refugees upstairs.<eos> Should we invite 'em down to the party?<eos> Are you sure you don't want some?<eos> - Shit, I missed you.
You!<eos> You're the reason Poussey is gone.<eos> T, don't do this.<eos> They ain't never gonna give us Bayley.<eos> But now I got you.<eos> Say something!<eos> - Say something, God damn it.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> That's all you got?<eos> You sorry?
But now I got you.<eos> Say something!<eos> - Say something, God damn it.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> That's all you got?<eos> You sorry?<eos> You think this is gonna make you feel better?<eos> Go ahead, try it.<eos> But it won't.<eos> I promise you that.
Hey, where is she?<eos> Uh, I really don't know.<eos> A number of staff was recently relocated to the surveillance annex.<eos> Maybe your friend is there.<eos> We need more footage.<eos> We need to know more about that audio signal.<eos> If that's how they communicate, we'll have something big... something actionable.<eos> This is pointless.<eos> You saw it yourself... there are thousands of drones in those walls.<eos> I mean, we didn't you see that whole bloody nest?
Are we gonna be okay?<eos> They need to find Broussard and the thing he took from the Rap.<eos> As long as I seem useful, we'll be okay.<eos> I'll keep working to find out what they have on us.<eos> How's Charlie?<eos> Lindsey went after him, and I threw her out.<eos> I've already called Maddie.<eos> I'm gonna go up there tonight.<eos> I'm gonna get ahead of this.<eos> And a messenger, uh, dropped off clothes for you.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't come into my house and insult his work... our work.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> You actually believe this shit.<eos> Don't be so judgmental.<eos> You don't know the things that I've seen.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Everything you've been telling me about Bram... is that true?<eos> - Of course it's true.<eos> - If you believe the rest of this, how do I know that he's not in the Factory or...<eos> I would never, ever lie to you about something like that.
Let's go!<eos> That wasn't a request!<eos> Aunt Maddie?<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> What? What is it?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> What the hell happened to you, Bram?<eos> It's nothing. It's a loading dock accident.<eos> I'm fine, okay?<eos> I brought you something.
Will?<eos> Hey, Doc.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> This isn't a good time.<eos> It's important.<eos> This is the Green Zone. You can't just barge in here.<eos> I need you to take a ride with me.<eos> And why would I do that?<eos> Look, Doc, our boys played Little League together, which is the only reason I didn't come with an APC and an assault team, break your door down, and have them drag you out of here in front of your family.<eos> I did you a favor today.
We can't, Katie.<eos> I know.<eos> Even if we dropped him at the Green Zone gates, best case scenario-- they'll just get him healthy enough to torture.<eos> Then he gives up you and everybody else.<eos> There's no good out here.<eos> He wants to talk to you.<eos> You're lucky, you know?<eos> The two of you.<eos> Not everyone gets what you have.<eos> What do you need, son?
BB?<eos> It was the RAP gauntlet.<eos> He was exposed to something.<eos> And then he wanted to go out like a soldier.<eos> Where were you?<eos> I was... working.<eos> Everything takes longer now.<eos> Can't just walk down the street anymore.<eos> Your whole cell almost fell apart today.<eos> You need to be there to protect them from themselves.
And the one thing we thought would help might in fact be killing us!<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> - Really?<eos> Then why are we sealing it in a lead-lined box?<eos> Because Broussard is right.<eos> We are in it now. We have to keep fighting.<eos> - Enough of this shit.<eos> - Simon.<eos> Simon!<eos> You can't--
Can we stop? Can we stop? Stop.<eos> Yeah, yeah, of course.<eos> Breathe.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't be. You were great.<eos> We should get up.<eos> I wouldn't want you to be late.<eos> Let's... let's just... let's just...<eos> Nothing would be better.<eos> But you need to get going.
I have a file from the deputy proxy's office.<eos> It's protected, but it's got all kinds of population data on the bloc, including information on where my eldest son, Bram, is being held.<eos> How do you know what's on the file if it's protected?<eos> Because my sister showed it to me.<eos> All I want's the information on my boy.<eos> You can do whatever you want with whatever else is on here.<eos> Shouldn't be too hard.<eos> Couldn't have been easy getting that.<eos> I took a risk for my son.<eos> I'll be grateful for whatever you can do.
You expect me to believe that someone else snuck into that office and stole the exact file we happened to be looking at?<eos> Maybe you downloaded it by accident?<eos> So I'm an idiot?<eos> Look...<eos> I'm sorry you and Nolan are in trouble, but I didn't take anything from your house.<eos> I wouldn't do that.<eos> Fine.<eos> But, Katie, this thing with Lindsey...<eos> For your sake, for how it looks, you have got to work things out with her.<eos> With what's happening, you do not want any extra attention.
They cannot be trusted to do what's right.<eos> Okay, let's take a seat and read chapter five, all right?<eos> - Mrs. Bowman.<eos> - Hi, Lindsey.<eos> Did you come for the service?<eos> I came to apologize.<eos> I completely overreacted to the situation.<eos> I know you were just trying to do what's best for the children.<eos> And...<eos> Gracie misses you, and we'd love for you to come back to the house.
Now get down! Get down, now!<eos> Who is that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Making room. Help me.<eos> I think she's drowning. So?<eos> She's dead anyway.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Help me!<eos> You need to focus.
When?<eos> Six months.<eos> There was more on the file.<eos> The Occupation is sending more and more people to the factory every month.<eos> We're just a-a labor force for them, and they're burning through us like firewood.<eos> And it's not just the file.<eos> Broussard and his team found a-a coded countdown hidden in the raps communications.<eos> It ends on the exact day that the bloc will be empty.<eos> They're counting down to our extinction.<eos> Will, I made a promise to you that I was done with the resistance.
Show me.<eos> Clean it up.<eos> Not a trace.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Do you remember when my... my mum came to visit?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think I traumatized her by taking her to that Ethiopian place.<eos> She liked you, you know.<eos> She always wondered why we... We couldn't make it work.<eos> I, uh, have to show you something.
How can we trust them?<eos> Well, if we stay in this bloc, we're dead anyway.<eos> Okay.<eos> What do we have to do?<eos> We need to give them Broussard.<eos> I have to say, Mr. Bowman, I didn't think you had it in you.<eos> I'm curious whether when you stole my keycard to help your attractive, fanatical girlfriend you thought about the consequences to not only yourself but every other person in this place.<eos> Today I'm not the prison warden who's gonna threaten you with punishment.<eos> Today I'm just a fellow inmate.<eos> And I'm telling you that you just signed your own death warrant and mine and every other soul in this camp.
And if it didn't happen, then maybe we all get to live another day.<eos> Of course, that would mean that there can be no contradicting evidence left behind, anything or anyone that could upset the delicate narrative that you and I are establishing.<eos> Which means that I need you to provide me with names.<eos> So you can have more people killed?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Was I, in my state of utter distress, babbling in tongues?<eos> Your friends are already dead!<eos> This is damage control.<eos> Either some of us die, or all of us do.<eos> You get the honor of deciding which one of those it's going to be.
Hello.<eos> I'm looking for the pilot who bailed out over Los Angeles this morning.<eos> I can help you.<eos> Help him?<eos> Your partner's been killed, and the entire Occupation is looking for you, but me and my friends are on your team.<eos> We just wanna talk.<eos> Over.<eos> Emmett.<eos> Emmett.<eos> It's time for you to come clean.

When we hit your terrorist lair, you said that you hid in the crawl space.<eos> But I know that isn't the whole story.<eos> This man helped you.<eos> I know something else.<eos> When we came to arrest you at the other safe house, you ran out before we hit the door.<eos> Because you were tipped... right?<eos> I just had a bad feeling.<eos> You're lying!<eos> It's... obvious.<eos> Did this man tip you again?

They cared who took the RAP.<eos> That's a problem that I solved.<eos> Because you were involved.<eos> You're just throwing shit against the wall and hoping it sticks.<eos> This is your wife.<eos> On the subway platform... before the attack on our Host.<eos> With Broussard.<eos> That's not my wife.<eos> Will... look at me.<eos> I'm telling you, from one professional to another,
So if we're gonna meet, it's gonna be on my terms.<eos> Tell me what you wanna do.<eos> Hey.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Mom and Dad'll be home soon.<eos> I think Lindsey's dead.<eos> Your tutor?<eos> Um... look...<eos> Lindsey wasn't your friend.<eos> She was trying to brainwash you.
Bollocks.<eos> I just lit this.<eos> How fast were you going?<eos> 97.<eos> It's cool.<eos> I just pull over and... do my Afghan war vet thing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You could do that.<eos> Seriously?<eos> It's up to you.
You... mace your balls.<eos> You two, hold hands.<eos> And, you... recite "The Yellow Rose of Texas."<eos> ♪ And if I ever meet her, we nevermore will part ♪ Nah, I don't like that.<eos> Like what?<eos> That thing of yours... that thing that made me kiss you.<eos> - Genesis.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> I don't like it.<eos> You rather we just shoot our way out of this?
- Drive, drive, drive, drive!<eos> I gotta get the taste out.<eos> My Lord.<eos> What the heck you folks get into out there?<eos> Is that...<eos> Is that intestine?<eos> All right, I'm gonna call the cops right now!<eos> There's no cops left!<eos> That son of a bitch shot 'em all!<eos> And we don't want any more trouble, so why don't you just pretend we weren't here?
Sorry.<eos> All right.<eos> Living room.<eos> That's Eddie the dog.<eos> He used to bite, but then he got old.<eos> Can I ask a question that isn't about the dog and the different rooms?<eos> She wants to know about the girl.<eos> Well, parishioners need help with their urges... drugs, sex, Twitter.<eos> They come to me.<eos> So, someone comes to you for help, and you put them in a cage?
That's her card?<eos> It's sort of a... dance hall down in Kimble County.<eos> Right.<eos> Maybe she can help.<eos> So, I guess we just drive down to Kimble County and ask to talk to this... Tammy.<eos> Can't be that easy.<eos> No, son.<eos> I'm sure it won't be.<eos> You broke my door and my dog.<eos> What the hell else do you want?
- Tammy, please! - Doug!<eos> Doug, help me!<eos> Get in here!<eos> Tammy, Tammy, it's fine. It's fine.<eos> No one's gonna hurt you.<eos> No.<eos> Damn!<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!<eos> Damn it.<eos> I'm sorry, Tammy, but you're gonna need to tell me.
She was at a doctor's appointment, at the clinic in Sector 4.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Half the mirror came down on Sector 4.<eos> Mei's gone.<eos> No...<eos> Get out there, you little shit.<eos> - Where's Dawes?<eos> - Don't know.<eos> Let me check my pockets.<eos> You're going to tell me everything he said, or I'm going to break you in two.
Let me check my pockets.<eos> You're going to tell me everything he said, or I'm going to break you in two.<eos> Dawes is gone, sasa ke?<eos> And the science man, oso.<eos> Oye!<eos> Him one with us.<eos> What doing here?<eos> None of your business.<eos> Fodagut, bera, stay back.<eos> I trusted you, you little shit.
So Dawes obviously had inside help.<eos> What, so that's it?<eos> They're just gone?<eos> They turned their transponder off and went dark two minutes later.<eos> We lost track...<eos> Who's in charge of security at this goddamn station?<eos> That would be me.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Say what you mean.<eos> Either you're doing an incredibly shitty job or you're no longer in control of the people who work for you.
Everything I had was there.<eos> There's no point in going back now.<eos> It'll take them years to rebuild the station.<eos> Forgive me for saying so, but I don't think you're cut out for that kind of work.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's an accurate assessment.<eos> I'm going back to Mars.<eos> I still have some family there.<eos> The terraforming project could always use more agri-techs.<eos> I know that you need time to grieve, and it's too hard to think about the future now.
He only heard it once, after Eros burned up.<eos> You didn't mention any of this.<eos> There wasn't any time.<eos> We need to find the source of that shout before Cortazar leads Dawes to it.<eos> Cortazar must've been using the station's antennae for his scan.<eos> If you give me access the antenna control logs,<eos> I might be able to figure out where he was looking.<eos> We made sure that Cortazar wasn't leaving any traces of his work in Tycho's normal logs.<eos> But if we go outside and hook into the antennae directly, we might be able to get what you need.<eos> I can help you with that.

- I guess I could stay.<eos> - No, no, it's okay.<eos> I'll join you as soon as I can.<eos> Come, come, no time for waste.<eos> Doris!<eos> Must cut thrust for other ship to dock, okay?<eos> So hold, ready for zero-g, now we go.<eos> Inners wreck Ganymede.<eos> Belter life first from now on.<eos> You lucky, beltalowda.
Taki fo da gut...<eos> If this is what you used to do for a living, then, you must have led a boring life.<eos> Unfortunately not.<eos> This is the last antenna Cortazar was using.<eos> With this, we should have enough data for a decent triangulation on Cortazar's shout.<eos> You don't seem eager for the answer.<eos> Does it make you happy to know there's more of that stuff out there?<eos> If it is, it is. It's better to know.<eos> Tell me.<eos> Did Fred ever do you wrong?
Sure, we can go in blind again, guns blazing.<eos> Maybe we can steal another ship to smash into it.<eos> We did that already and look where it got us, right back where we started.<eos> Look, the protomolecule is out in the world now, we just have to accept that.<eos> And figure out how to deal with it.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Naomi.<eos> Jim...<eos> Jim!<eos> I know you feel like we failed...
I'm sorry, I really am.<eos> What happened out there is a crime. It should be punished.<eos> But there's nothing I can do about it right now.<eos> Look... You made it here.<eos> You're alive.<eos> Hold on to that.<eos> Get some food, grab some mat space and rest.<eos> There's other people from Ganymede here, maybe there's somebody you know.<eos> Hey, bro, here you go.<eos> That's for you.
You know what your problem is?<eos> I'd like to.<eos> I'm gonna tell you.<eos> Your problem is the only person you give a shit about is yourself.<eos> Isn't that most people's problems? If they're being honest?<eos> There's a lot of people coming aboard this station right now, Amos, and they need our help.<eos> - So why don't you help them.<eos> - I am.<eos> What I'm trying to figure out is why you won't.<eos> 'Cause as far as I can tell, you got nothing better to do.

All right, darlin'.<eos> Okay, let's get you to med bay.<eos> That's it, one step at a time.<eos> Okay.<eos> This is the head, plus a shower.<eos> In here, there's clean clothes.<eos> Magboots.<eos> Keep them on.<eos> Takes a little bit of practice to get used to them.<eos> Use this if you need something, or you want to leave the cabin.
Takes a little bit of practice to get used to them.<eos> Use this if you need something, or you want to leave the cabin.<eos> So you're locking me in?<eos> Is this how you treat all your guests?<eos> You're not a guest.<eos> You're a guide.<eos> Naomi said that you're coming with us to find your little girl?<eos> It's a good reason.<eos> I need to ask you something.<eos> Fred told you there was more protomolecule out there.
- I'm sure we could convince 'em to...<eos> - I don't want you doing a goddamn thing.<eos> I know your type.<eos> You're on a crusade.<eos> So go save the world, if you think you can.<eos> I'll settle for helping a few of the poor souls who have to live in it.<eos> We'll be out the door as soon as we land.<eos> Good.<eos> Reminds me of Baltimore.<eos> Yep, you gotta like this, boss.
All of them still, none of them moving.<eos> Just frozen moments.<eos> But if you experience those pictures one after the other, then everything comes alive.<eos> - Am I on time?<eos> - That's a very big question.<eos> You know you're my foster mum?<eos> He's like my foster tutor.<eos> Am I going to have to break every bone in his body?<eos> It's not like that.<eos> You need to keep your eye on men.
- Well, it's a defect.<eos> At least it's a defect that looks like a star.<eos> I'm getting it fixed.<eos> OK.<eos> Sorry.<eos> None of my business, but are you freaking out about something?<eos> Please.<eos> You can say no.<eos> Would you come with me?<eos> Can I show you something?
I'm getting it fixed.<eos> OK.<eos> Sorry.<eos> None of my business, but are you freaking out about something?<eos> Please.<eos> You can say no.<eos> Would you come with me?<eos> Can I show you something?<eos> God, yes.<eos> - I love this place, don't you?
What is that?<eos> That's me, that's my face, but...<eos> It's wrong.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Sorry. Some other time.<eos> Promise?<eos> Pilot is located.<eos> Link is established.<eos> It's a rug.<eos> Haven't got you anything.
She sounds... nice.<eos> She died when I was a baby.<eos> Yeah.<eos> If she died when you were a baby, when did she say that?<eos> In my head.<eos> I'm supposed to look like her, but I don't really know.<eos> There's hardly any photographs.<eos> She hated having her picture taken.<eos> But if someone's gone, do pictures really help?<eos> I thought you'd enjoy choosing something for yourself, as you're always passing judgments.
Your face looks wrong, because it looks right.<eos> What's the one thing you never see when you look in a reflection?<eos> Your face. You never see your face the right way round.<eos> Right.<eos> Look for a freckle or a funny tooth.<eos> - Something that's not symmetrical.<eos> - My badge! See, your friend saw it straightaway because of her eye.<eos> But... it's moving like a reflection.<eos> It's not reflecting you.<eos> It's mimicking you.
Tutorial's over, take the night off.<eos> It's all cancelled.<eos> Go and be a proper student texts, snogging, a vegan wrap.<eos> But what about the puddle?<eos> It's just some freak optical effect.<eos> I'm bored already.<eos> Passenger selected.<eos> Pursuit engaged.<eos> Hey!<eos> I'll make you a cuppa for the bath.
Hang on.<eos> The room's still inside the box.<eos> - This isn't a knock-through.<eos> - Nope.<eos> Doctor! It's bigger on the inside than it is on the outside!<eos> Wey-hey!<eos> We got there!<eos> How is that possible?<eos> How do you do that?<eos> Well, first, you have to imagine a very big box fitting inside a very small box.
- I don't like there.<eos> I want you running interference.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> - Can I say no, sir? - No.<eos> - Yes, then.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - But no really.<eos> - Where are we?<eos> Well, we're basically in the middle of a war.<eos> No... Well, it's a war zone, and this is just your basic skirmish, and it's not as bad as it sounds, I promise you.
I've sealed the area, all the Daleks are quarantined... except that one.<eos> It's OK.<eos> This isn't a Dalek.<eos> Look.<eos> Look at the eye.<eos> Heather.<eos> Heather.<eos> Interesting, you had a gun but you didn't use it.<eos> Why? You've already taken one person from the Earth.<eos> I'm going to let that pass, because I have to, but I will not let you take another.

I will.<eos> I will.<eos> I really liked you.<eos> I really liked you.<eos> Bill... don't, don't!<eos> Don't do that!<eos> Listen, please, just listen to him.<eos> Don't, don't! Bill, let go!<eos> Bill, listen to me.<eos> Whatever she's showing you, whatever she's letting you see.
She is not human any more.<eos> Goodbye, Heather.<eos> Goodbye...<eos> Bill.<eos> Bill!<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> You don't look all right.<eos> She's fine.<eos> That's the Doctor for you.
The only exciting thing! I'm sorry.<eos> OK.<eos> Let me remember just for a week.<eos> Just a week.<eos> OK, well, just for tonight.<eos> Just one night.<eos> Come on, let me have some good dreams for once.<eos> OK.<eos> Do what you've got to do.<eos> But imagine... just imagine how it would feel if someone did this to you.
No, I don't think so.<eos> - Who's that, then?<eos> - Never you mind.<eos> Your temperature's gone up.<eos> Always does when you take it, Staff.<eos> Honestly, Mr Talbot!<eos> You really think they'd try for Bakewell in hospital?<eos> It's the last dregs of the Matthews Gang.<eos> He's all that stands between them and a long spell inside.<eos> I'll get Mr Bright to sign you a chitty.
Win?<eos> Love of God.<eos> Winifred!<eos> I went to see Dr Moody today.<eos> - For what?<eos> - Nerves.<eos> Not sleeping.<eos> I just don't feel myself, Fred.<eos> What's that mean?<eos> You just need something to... take you out of yourself, that's all.

I do.<eos> You shouldn't.<eos> You know... .. I thought...<eos> I thought for a minute...<eos> Nearly.<eos> All those times you walked me home.<eos> The perfect gentleman and you never tried it on, not once.<eos> It's funny how things turn out.<eos> It can turn out how you want it to.<eos> You should...

- No change.<eos> Why do they say that?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> He's changed utterly.<eos> He's changed beyond all recognition.<eos> - I suppose they mean in his condition.<eos> - I'm aware of what they mean.<eos> It is good of you to come.<eos> We don't see eye to eye.<eos> Why would you be kind?
The porter, Capper, he was on duty for most of the deaths.<eos> Erm... the nurses.<eos> It's a changing roster, so all of them have access to the ward.<eos> - Patients?<eos> - The only long-term one is Burt Talbot.<eos> He was present for four of the deaths in Bed Ten.<eos> Where were you yesterday?<eos> I had things to do.<eos> Family, or...?<eos> Well, if you need an ear, or more time off...
You're wasting your breath.<eos> She's a big girl.<eos> But you know what his reputation's like.<eos> And they do talk, doctors.<eos> She doesn't want to be just another notch on the bedpost.<eos> - We nurses need to look out for each other.<eos> - I don't get it at all.<eos> Give them a white coat and a stethoscope, and we're expected to fall at their feet?<eos> Evening.<eos> Some food for you.
How come that wasn't found at postmortem?<eos> Insulin disappears from the blood after death.<eos> Now, we don't fully understand the mechanism whereby hypoglycaemia brings on death, but the latest thinking is a fall in glucose levels causes a massive release of adrenaline, which triggers an electrical disturbance in the heart.<eos> Looks like we're there.<eos> Crikey, he's ripe.<eos> Yeah, left buttock.<eos> - Minute puncture wound.<eos> - Same as Bakewell.<eos> - How'd it go?<eos> - You wouldn't have enjoyed it.
- Where can I reach you if --<eos> - Cowley Station.<eos> Well, then.<eos> We won't keep you.<eos> Not at all.<eos> It was very good to meet you.<eos> How was your day?<eos> Well, it was an endless social whirl.<eos> You'll read all about it in next month's Harper's.<eos> If you want to meet people, you've got to go to the village.
Thought after that knockback with your sergeant's...<eos> - It was more than a knockback.<eos> - There you go.<eos> If your face don't fit, matey...<eos> It'd be automatic promotion.<eos> More money, London weighting.<eos> It's a solid offer.<eos> It's a DI Craddock, Tintagel House.<eos> We were at Hendon together.<eos> You should give him a call.
Half-day closing.<eos> Who is he?<eos> Why has there always got to be a "he"?<eos> Unless you've started smoking Weights.<eos> Is this what we raised you to, some bloke's fancy piece?<eos> - He's nice.<eos> - Married?<eos> Kids?<eos> - He's gonna leave her.<eos> - That what he told you?
No, it's not a bad card.<eos> Ruled by Uranus, The Fool is a symbol of the soul's journey.<eos> It stands for change.<eos> What can you tell me about Bramford mere?<eos> There are things in the world older than you know.<eos> We come and go.<eos> But the land endures.<eos> Behind you...<eos> Oh, The Lovers inverted.<eos> - You've been unlucky in love.
Is that what all the police are doing down by the mere, looking for him?<eos> Yes.<eos> That's right.<eos> Well, good luck with that.<eos> Away, Kip.<eos> 11:00am, eighth floor, Tintagel House.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Look forward to meeting you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Fetched you a rabbit, Grandma.
- There's tea in the pot.<eos> - Right.<eos> I saw that copper you said about... Morse.<eos> - Where's this?<eos> - Up by The Grange.<eos> You want to keep clear of the Bergers.<eos> Him and her both.<eos> There's nothing for the likes of us up there.<eos> Hear me?<eos> I'll chop you some logs.
It means rank.<eos> Well...<eos> It goes without saying, we shall miss your abilities, but... you must do what you think right.<eos> For an officer of your talent to remain at detective constable would be a waste of material.<eos> Believe me, Morse, I've seen it all too often.<eos> Better men passed over in favour of mediocrity because they weren't... club.<eos> So you think I should take it?<eos> That's a matter entirely for you.<eos> If you'll forgive the presumption, you're a man, I think, more used to putting the concerns of others before himself.<eos> Perhaps in this instance, you should consider what's in your own best interests.
Report in.<eos> Holy crap.<eos> Burkhardt got away!<eos> Going south on Milwaukee.<eos> We are in pursuit.<eos> - Close off Milwaukee.<eos> - Set up a perimeter.<eos> We can't go far.<eos> We're gonna have to dump it.<eos> And you got to get out of sight.
Death grip.<eos> That's what Rosalee called it, anyway.<eos> "Death grip" does not sound good.<eos> How did you get out of it?<eos> Rosalee cut the dead guy's arm off.<eos> Oh, well, yeah, I guess that could do it.<eos> You have to be very careful with that.<eos> I will be.<eos> You need to be careful too.<eos> I don't think you should be carrying the stick around all the time.
Not that he murdered somebody but that he was arrested for it.<eos> Was it Bonaparte?<eos> - No, Rachel Wood.<eos> - He killed his own mistress?<eos> It's complicated, but he wants me to get him out of it.<eos> How?<eos> I don't know, but I'll be back as soon as I can.<eos> Bye.<eos> Okay.<eos> You are so lucky Nick is your dad.
- Yes.<eos> - Okay, let's do that.<eos> Are you just... leaving me up here?<eos> All alone?<eos> You're not alone.<eos> I'm here.<eos> What do you want me to do now?<eos> Never thought I'd see this.<eos> Well, enjoy it while you can.<eos> - What do you want from me?
Well, enjoy it while you can.<eos> - What do you want from me?<eos> - A little help.<eos> And what kind of help would that be?<eos> Well, ironically, I don't have an alibi for the night Rachel was killed.<eos> - Where were you?<eos> - I was killing Bonaparte.<eos> Oh, well, that is awkward.<eos> But we both know I didn't kill Rachel.<eos> What do you want me to do?
That guy is a dick.<eos> We don't bring him down.<eos> We let him go.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> Renard doesn't want to go to jail any more than I do, so we need to talk.<eos> You think you can trust him, Nick?<eos> No, but I trust his need to destroy me.<eos> Is there anything I can do?<eos> Well, you've done enough.<eos> Why don't you just go back home?
- Hey, it's me.<eos> Oh, hey, where are you?<eos> Wait, don't tell me.<eos> I need your help with something.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Uh, actually, I'm in your precinct.<eos> - Can you talk?<eos> - I think so.<eos> I need to make a deal with somebody who I don't trust.<eos> Oh, you need a Trust Me Knot.
He has an alibi.<eos> Me.<eos> I know where he was and what he was doing.<eos> But if I testify that you were killing Bonaparte at the time, that might complicate both of our lives even more.<eos> - But that's not why we're here.<eos> - We're here to help you.<eos> And how do you suggest we do that?<eos> You drop all of the charges against me.<eos> And reinstate him into the department.<eos> And we give you an alibi that'll work for the night Rachel was killed.
Me neither.<eos> Check it out on the computer.<eos> Man.<eos> I just had a really awful thought.<eos> What if our evidence against Renard is too strong and they take it to trial?<eos> Then the deal is off, and Nick is screwed.<eos> You're not helping.<eos> There are no witnesses, and Adalind's alibi should clear him.<eos> Okay, she's believable, right?<eos> Well, when you're that pretty, people want to believe you.
How do we know the right place to look if we've never seen them before?<eos> Except in hell.<eos> I've got to go.<eos> I want you to come with me.<eos> You know I can't.<eos> I know, but even if you get out of this,<eos> Renard's still gonna be running the city.<eos> It'll be bad.<eos> Well, someone has to stay here and deal with it.<eos> You better be alive when I get back.
Previously on "Grimm"...<eos> I don't think you should be carrying the stick around all the time.
Bastard got everything he wanted.<eos> I want Burkhardt found.<eos> _<eos> We should've killed Renard when we had the chance.<eos> We never had the chance.<eos> Hey, guys. Cops were just here.<eos> Well, did they leave?<eos> Not before they checked out the shop, like, fully.<eos> What if they come back and break in?<eos> Nick, you need to get out of here.
- Let's go.<eos> Leave Diana's drawing... we'll keep trying to figure it out.<eos> We should've killed Renard when we didn't have the chance.<eos> Do not take this ring off, because it would be extremely painful... for your children.<eos> How was your day?<eos> Not very good.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> - If anything happens to Nick...<eos> - Yes, I've heard it all before.<eos> I really think you should be more worried about what happens to you.
How was your day?<eos> Not very good.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> - If anything happens to Nick...<eos> - Yes, I've heard it all before.<eos> I really think you should be more worried about what happens to you.<eos> How are we supposed to make this work?<eos> I'm not concerned about "we" making this work.<eos> It's your problem.<eos> Like it or not... you are stuck with me.
- Rachel Wood.<eos> You were arrested for her murder.<eos> Now, look, I had nothing to do with her death.<eos> As you may have heard, the charges were completely dropped.<eos> You were having an affair with her.<eos> That is none of your business.<eos> It certainly is my business!<eos> We were friends.<eos> I worked with her.<eos> We helped to get you elected.
We helped to get you elected.<eos> What's this about?<eos> - I was there that night.<eos> - Were you?<eos> I saw you go into her apartment.<eos> When I went in after you left, she was dead.<eos> I found her body.<eos> Look, I didn't kill Rachel.<eos> I loved her, and you killed her!<eos> - What do you want?
Are you?<eos> There may be a way to stop Renard from becoming mayor.<eos> What?<eos> How?<eos> The Verfluchte Zwillingsschwester.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> I'm with the kids.<eos> No, um...<eos> Eve is gonna do it for me.<eos> Um, so you're gonna need some of his hair.
I'm with the kids.<eos> No, um...<eos> Eve is gonna do it for me.<eos> Um, so you're gonna need some of his hair.<eos> When do you need it?<eos> As soon as possible.<eos> Where's Renard now?<eos> At the precinct, I think.<eos> Okay, go home.<eos> I'll send Monroe to you.
As soon as possible.<eos> Where's Renard now?<eos> At the precinct, I think.<eos> Okay, go home.<eos> I'll send Monroe to you.<eos> He'll call before he comes up, but you have to be very careful.<eos> Renard can't know you had anything to do with this.<eos> Nick, this better work.<eos> I can't spend another night at that house.<eos> Hopefully you won't have to.
As you know, the new captain of this precinct will be reporting directly to the mayor's office.<eos> I understand.<eos> It would be an honor to succeed you, sir.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> Before I announce my decision, you're gonna have to prove your loyalty.<eos> And not just to the mayor's office... but to me.<eos> I'm ready anytime... sir.<eos> - You got everything you need?<eos> - Except for the hair.<eos> Are you sure you should be handling all this stuff, I mean, now that you're pregnant?
- You got everything you need?<eos> - Except for the hair.<eos> Are you sure you should be handling all this stuff, I mean, now that you're pregnant?<eos> I think it should be fine, as long as I don't breathe through the hat.<eos> And seriously, is this even a good idea in the first place?<eos> I mean, the last time we did this,<eos> Juliette turned into a pretty wicked Hexenbiest.<eos> I mean, not that it was her fault, by the way.<eos> Adalind should be home by now.<eos> You should go.
- It's not important.<eos> - Are you hurt?<eos> - No.<eos> - What happened?<eos> Well, someone thought I killed Rachel.<eos> Thought it'd be worth a lot of money not to say anything.<eos> So that's not your blood.<eos> Blackmail is a risky business.<eos> - Here, give it to me.<eos> - I'll get you a new shirt.
- What?<eos> I'm just thinking, has this ever been done on a Grimm before?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, we should look at the books just to be safe.<eos> No, there's no time.<eos> - Wait!<eos> - What now?<eos> Your clothes, you should probably take them off.<eos> Renard is bigger than you.<eos> The clothes that you're wearing are gonna be a little bit tight.
I'll look at the books.<eos> Should it be happening like this?<eos> It's working.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - I don't think that's right.<eos> - What's not right?<eos> You should take a look.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> - I'm woged?<eos> - You cannot go out like that.
- You cannot go out like that.<eos> - How do I get rid of this?<eos> - You have to relax.<eos> Relax?<eos> You just turned me into a Zauberbiest!<eos> You can't get out of it until you calm down.<eos> You need to take some deep breaths.<eos> Nick, Nick, Nick, listen to me!<eos> You can control this.<eos> You just have to, like, let yourself go emotionally, right?
We're gonna let it go, okay?<eos> Breathe... and breathe.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - There you go.<eos> Yes.<eos> Oh, wow, that fel... that felt so weird.<eos> I got to say, I've never been this happy to see Renard.<eos> It's 6:30.<eos> You don't have much time.<eos> You need to get dressed.
I mean, every hair is perfect.<eos> It's a little weird being this tall.<eos> - Something wrong?<eos> - The way you move.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - It's a little off.<eos> Off?<eos> Off how?<eos> It's, uh... not quite Renard enough.<eos> Yeah, yeah, you need to be a little more...
If you'll excuse me.<eos> Can you tell us anything else about the undercover operation?<eos> Actually, yes, uh, only that Detective Burkhardt and his partner, Detective Griffin and, of course, Sergeant Wu did an exemplary job.<eos> Captain, we really do need to go.<eos> Yes, thank you.<eos> Thank you all.<eos> All right.<eos> The press in the city has been outstanding.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You will not get away with this.
So it hasn't worn off yet.<eos> Nope, it hasn't worn off yet.<eos> And it won't unless we come to an agreement.<eos> And it won't unless we come to an agreement.<eos> You think it's pretty clever what you did.<eos> This little game is over as of right now.<eos> It's not a game, and it's not over.<eos> Now, if you think Portland's big enough for two Sean Renards, think again.<eos> You'll always be contradicting yourself.<eos> No one is ever gonna believe you.
He doesn't know about the tunnels.<eos> You go with Hank in case Renard puts someone on Adalind.<eos> We'll find a way to get you back.<eos> Be careful.<eos> So, if I shoot you, is that considered suicide?<eos> I thought we were here to talk?<eos> At least one of me is good for my word.<eos> I really think there's only room for one of me in this city.<eos> Which one is that gonna be?<eos> Thought I'd give you that one.

- Well, it saved my life.<eos> And mine.<eos> I suppose you want your old job back.<eos> - Wu and Hank, too.<eos> - Sure, anything else.<eos> - I raise my son.<eos> - I raise my daughter.<eos> And Adalind comes with me.<eos> You're not my daddy.<eos> I tried to tell you.
You're not my daddy.<eos> I tried to tell you.<eos> You chose the wrong side, Sean.<eos> _<eos> You're not real.<eos> Real enough that you're talking to me.<eos> No.<eos> No, you're dead.<eos> Does that really matter?<eos> What do you want?
I tried to tell you.<eos> You chose the wrong side, Sean.<eos> _<eos> You're not real.<eos> Real enough that you're talking to me.<eos> No.<eos> No, you're dead.<eos> Does that really matter?<eos> What do you want?<eos> What do you want?
Oh, let's see how here you really are.<eos> Whoa, now wait a minute, Sean, that's hot coffee.<eos> Well, whoever he was talking to got him hotter than his coffee.<eos> Not our problem.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Talk about coffee going right through ya.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Well, my calendar's pretty open, seeing as how I'm dead.<eos> Look, if this is some kind of revenge haunting, don't forget I shot you to put you out of your misery.<eos> Oh, thank you for that. Really.

Really.<eos> But don't forget you betrayed us all.<eos> It's the real reason I'm dead.<eos> No, I gave you an opportunity to join me.
I don't know, I... got light-headed.<eos> I must've stood up too fast.<eos> Three eyes and three arms?<eos> You sure it wasn't a one-eyed, one-horned flying purple people eater?<eos> Well, I've got one with two heads.<eos> Maybe it isn't Wesen.<eos> What do you mean, like a real monster?<eos> Please don't don't me you think they exist.<eos> Wait, I think I found it.<eos> - You don't need to see that.
- I missed you, too.<eos> - I will be ready to pick you up tomorrow, or before, if you change your mind.<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you too.<eos> Oh, listen, there's something you both need to know.<eos> Um, we're gonna be moving.<eos> - Why? - Because I'm not gonna be the mayor anymore.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'll send you the address.
- He died.<eos> - Really?<eos> Do you know how he died?<eos> You killed him, Daddy.<eos> - Did I? - Uh-huh.<eos> Do you know why I did?<eos> Because he hurt Mommy.<eos> Men shouldn't hurt mommies.<eos> Well, that's very true, they shouldn't.<eos> You know, honey, you don't always have to protect everybody.
Hi...<eos> Where's the baby?<eos> Oh, that's not how this works.<eos> We ask the questions.<eos> You can't let him live with his parents.<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> - Yes, we do understand.<eos> El Cuegle.<eos> Hope that's how you pronounce it.<eos> You may be a Grimm, but you don't understand this.
Why don't you tell us how many kids you kidnapped?<eos> - It's complicated.<eos> - It's not complicated.<eos> It's cannibalism.<eos> If I wasn't a cop, you'd be holding your head in your hands right now.<eos> - All three of them.<eos> - I don't do this because I want to. I have to.<eos> What, do you get a headache if you don't?<eos> - I get visions.<eos> - And these visions - tell you to do what?
If you think it's so terrible, why don't you just stop?<eos> Because I can see the past with one eye and the present with the other, and the third... with that eye, the future can be seen.<eos> So you're some Dickens character - in "A Christmas Carol."<eos> - I am not a monster.<eos> - No, you're Wesen.<eos> - My visions tell me about children who will do monstrous things.<eos> That is why I have to take them.<eos> That is why I have to eat them.<eos> That's your reason for kidnapping Auggie?<eos> You might wanna rethink that if you're gonna use that as your defense.
You might wanna rethink that if you're gonna use that as your defense.<eos> When Auggie turns 19, he will do something terrible.<eos> What?<eos> His parents' marriage will continue to fall apart.<eos> It will become violent.<eos> Auggie will grow up isolated and unstable.<eos> That is not a crime worthy of your punishment.<eos> On his 19th birthday, he will murder his parents.<eos> - And that is only the beginning.<eos> - How do you know that?
My baby boy.<eos> I was so worried about you.<eos> This is the best day of my life.<eos> Haley...<eos> Yeah?<eos> Honey, I'm... I'm concerned.<eos> Paul, Auggie's back.<eos> We have nothing to worry about.<eos> No, I'm talking about you.<eos> You're gonna have to deal with what you think happened here.
Yeah?<eos> Honey, I'm... I'm concerned.<eos> Paul, Auggie's back.<eos> We have nothing to worry about.<eos> No, I'm talking about you.<eos> You're gonna have to deal with what you think happened here.<eos> - With what I think happened?<eos> - I need you to go see<eos> - a psychiatrist. - I can't believe you.<eos> I really think that you need to cons...
There are patterns on this cloth.<eos> - I've seen them before.<eos> - I can see it.<eos> Can you draw what you're seeing?<eos> I've never seen anything like this.<eos> You chose the wrong side, Sean.<eos> - No, you're dead.<eos> - Does that really matter?<eos> - Get the hell out of here.<eos> - I'm not gonna make it that easy for you.
- Twins.<eos> - It's just twins.<eos> - Well, maybe not.<eos> Well, this is a surprise.<eos> There is a third heartbeat.<eos> - Three? - Mm-hmm.<eos> I love you and we can do this.<eos> I'm pretty sure I was dead.<eos> Well, you were there.<eos> You should know.
Oh. Well, that's too bad.<eos> Hey. How long you been here?<eos> About 15 minutes.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> I overslept.<eos> Did everything go okay last night?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> No, we had a great time, didn't we?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Okay, well, we'll call you later.
If Kelly makes any noises, you just let me know, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Eve?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Eve!<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Okay.<eos> What are you doing down here?<eos> I gotta get you out of here.<eos> You gotta get up.
No, sweetie, She's just resting.<eos> Is she gonna die?<eos> I hope not.<eos> But I think she's got a fever.<eos> I'm gonna go get her a washcloth, okay?<eos> Diana?<eos> Diana?<eos> Diana?<eos> Diana?<eos> Oh, I really don't think it's a good idea for you to be... down here.
- According to this. - If I was up for one day every seven years, I'd be a party animal.<eos> Although in those 24 hours, it needs to find a food source to take underground and feed on.<eos> And by food source, you mean...<eos> Somebody big enough to sustain them underground.<eos> So this guy might be looking for his next plus-size stockpile.<eos> Wu just sent a facial composite of the guy from the diner.<eos> So that's our Ataktos Fuse.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I've seen this face before.<eos> - I think I know this guy. - How could you know him if he's only above ground for one day every seven years?
Hey, what are you gonna do?<eos> Find out where my drink is.<eos> I don't know what you think you're doing, but I'm going outside for a smoke, where if you have the nerve to show your ass, I'm gonna kick it from here to Houston.<eos> Otherwise, you better be gone.<eos> You got me?<eos> Loud and clear.<eos> Uh, bartender.<eos> If you please.<eos> Hi.<eos> Brought you a drink.
Uh, bartender.<eos> If you please.<eos> Hi.<eos> Brought you a drink.<eos> What are you trying to do now, pick me up?<eos> No, I just felt sorry for you since I'm picking up your girl and we'll be having a real good time and you're not.<eos> Don't say I didn't warn you.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Hey.<eos> Thank you for the drink, but I think you should probably get out of here.

I should have told you guys I was down there.<eos> How long were you down there?<eos> Since Monroe and Rosalee's.<eos> I don't even know how long that's been.<eos> I wanted to leave, and then every time I tried, my body just couldn't move.<eos> Diana knew you were down there.<eos> She knew you were drawing.<eos> She was drawing the same thing.<eos> A lot of them are the same.<eos> I think it's time I told you I'm sorry for what I did to you.
So why kill him?<eos> Bartender said the victim was with a woman at the bar.<eos> But she left with another guy who bought her a drink.<eos> ID'd him off the composite.<eos> It's our guy.<eos> Monroe's FaceTiming me.<eos> - Monroe.<eos> - Nick, we know who it is.<eos> That's why I'm FaceTiming you.<eos> We have to show you.
And his father's before him.<eos> - You want this bad.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How bad?<eos> All right.<eos> Let's go find out if this ghost is real.<eos> This way.<eos> Aspirateur d'Esprits.<eos> A spirit vacuum.<eos> If any spirits are attached to you, this will pull them out.
That happens in every hotel. Is there something<eos> - out of the ordinary?<eos> - No.<eos> - Thank you for your time. - Feel free to call me if there's anything I can do.<eos> She was a big help.<eos> We still don't know how the Alpe got in Dan's room, 'cause his place was a fortress.<eos> These things can't walk through walls... can they?<eos> - I'm not here to haunt you.<eos> - Really?<eos> Then why don't you go wherever it is you go?
You get the hell out of my office.<eos> I won't forget this.<eos> My god, do you feel that?<eos> That is the tingling of like souls.<eos> That's love.<eos> That is the real thing.<eos> Nick, before you say anything you're about to regret...<eos> I love you.<eos> - Monroe...<eos> - What do you want?
I love you.<eos> - Monroe...<eos> - What do you want?<eos> You.<eos> There's never been anyone else for me.<eos> There never will be.<eos> Does your tummy hurt?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> My tummy hurts when I'm sad.<eos> Are you sad?
Yeah, but... To where?<eos> I-I don't know, I don't know, but it looked a lot like what I saw with the death grip guy, except for skull man wasn't there.<eos> I'm just glad I'm not the only one seeing it this time.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> I think.<eos> Should we tell Monroe and rosalee?<eos> Not until we have a better handle on what it is we just saw.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - I missed you!
- I missed you!<eos> I missed you too.<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> Want me to make breakfast?<eos> - Sure, if you like. - Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> How's life at the loft? It's fine.<eos> I'll be back early Sunday night to pick her up.<eos> What are you guys gonna do?<eos> How many chocolate chip cookies do you want for breakfast, dad?
Diana, these are amazing.<eos> These cookies are perfect.<eos> I know.<eos> What are you drawing?<eos> Stuff I saw.<eos> Interesting stuff.<eos> You saw this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where?<eos> Mommy said I can't tell you.
- Dude.<eos> So I'm on the side of his house, and I'm looking at him in the backyard, and I see him peeing on his own fence.<eos> My god.<eos> My god!<eos> You were marking?<eos> I still had a few bad habits.<eos> I thought that was very strange, and I knew this guy has to be involved in some way.<eos> And that's when I got a whiff of you.<eos> And that is when you jumped through the window.<eos> You shouldn't have come back.
Well, unless you're gonna invite him up, will you turn off that light?<eos> yeah?<eos> You should've kept your word.<eos> Lieutenant grossante.<eos> If you ever want to see your little girl again, listen carefully.<eos> You have my daughter.<eos> You stabbed me in the back.<eos> Look, there were things out of my control.<eos> You threatened to have me arrested for a murder you had me commit.<eos> I never threatened to arrest you.
Good morning, birthday boy.<eos> Morning.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I think so.<eos> Maybe one too many last night?<eos> Yeah, that's probably it.<eos> I need coffee.<eos> I can go with you.<eos> Or I can just bring you one.
- Morning.<eos> Morning.<eos> Made more lovely by you saying the word "morning."<eos> I feel the dawn of a crystalline new day in your voice, and your hair is more exuberant than ever.<eos> I adore it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I was just looking at the view.<eos> It is so... beautiful, yes.<eos> But it could never hold a candle to the view of you.<eos> Eve, there's something I've never told you.
What?<eos> Eve!<eos> Have you seen Eve?<eos> No.<eos> Eve!<eos> Eve, we need to talk!<eos> - Monroe...<eos> - What? I need to talk to Eve.<eos> Monroe.<eos> - Monroe! - What do you want?
She's gonna kill me.<eos> I found you.<eos> That's not a very good hiding place.<eos> No.<eos> Please?<eos> God!<eos> Please...<eos> No!<eos> She can't love you if you're dead!<eos> Don't you dare touch him!
She's in pretty bad shape.<eos> - How are you feeling?<eos> - I really shouldn't be here.<eos> I don't think you're in any condition to go anywhere else right now.<eos> Well, this is a surprise.<eos> There is a third heartbeat.<eos> I love you.<eos> We can do this.<eos> What are you drawing?<eos> Mommy said I can't tell you.
Let me handle it.<eos> I just... I don't want to destroy it until we know what happened.<eos> Well, that's fine.<eos> Let's just put it somewhere where nobody can look at it till we know what the hell is going on with it.<eos> Let's put it in here.<eos> We can lock it.<eos> Why would Shelley go to see Deirdre?<eos> What would he want from her now?<eos> He won't stop.<eos> Hasn't Shelley been hounding you for help?
Okay, say we do find this plant dude.<eos> How do we deal with it?<eos> Considering what happened with Dev...<eos> I'm not sure bullets are gonna be enough.<eos> We're gonna need something sharp.<eos> Yep, looks like a Jubokko, all right.<eos> I gotta say, for a tree that survives on human blood, it looks pretty harmless.<eos> Get closer.<eos> Sweet Moses.<eos> Gives you a real sense of being one with nature.
But if it messes with my family,<eos> I will rip its green ugly eyeballs out.<eos> - I know one thing's for sure...<eos> - What?<eos> I'm gonna have some seriously bad hair days for awhile.<eos> I hope this is still an okay time.<eos> Yeah, the kids are asleep.<eos> Do you want some wine?<eos> No thanks.<eos> So what did you need my help with?
I think one of the reasons it is connecting to me is because I can see those symbols.<eos> Diana can see the symbols too.<eos> - I know.<eos> - That's why we can't wait.<eos> We have to find this thing, and kill it.<eos> I'll get the books.<eos> Guess we'll start with you.<eos> You haven't been opened in a while, have you?<eos> Mirrors.<eos> - You said you liked this place.
The crme bre was not my idea.<eos> Yeah, but how good was that?<eos> You stay here.<eos> You've been in those heels all day.<eos> I'll get the car.<eos> My swollen feet salute you.<eos> - What are you doing up?<eos> - Waiting for you.<eos> You hungry?<eos> I can make you something.
I just started on the second book, and so far, nothing about mirrors as... portals or gateways to anywhere.<eos> So if you're worried about me, don't be.<eos> Yes, I'm... I'm very worried about you.<eos> Nick, we're the only two people who have seen this thing.<eos> If we don't find a way to get to it, it will find a way to get to us.<eos> Just don't do it alone, okay?<eos> Believe me, this is not something I wanna do alone.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I...<eos> I think you ought to get some sleep.
- I don't know.<eos> - And I think you're lying.<eos> I don't care what you think, Sean.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I wanna see the tunnel.<eos> Damn it, Adalind, our daughter is in the center of something big.<eos> You think I don't know that?<eos> Then I need to know everything you know.<eos> Now tell me where that tunnel is.<eos> You're gonna have to take that up with Nick.
Who told you it was dangerous?<eos> You show me the tunnel, and I'll tell you.<eos> No, it's not gonna happen that way.<eos> This is my daughter we're talking about, and you're putting her at risk.<eos> Share what you know.<eos> I'll do the same.<eos> Maybe this guy won't call back, and we won't have to deal with any of this.<eos> I remember my father calling the Gevatter Tod for my grandfather.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> How old were you?
Do what you have to do.<eos> We're not gonna interfere.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you want us to stay with you?<eos> Yes, I'd like that.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Yes.<eos> You sleep now, sweetheart.<eos> I love you.<eos> I'm gonna miss you.
Did Renard talk to you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Someone he knows thinks Diana might be in danger.<eos> - Who?<eos> - He won't tell me, but it's someone who has the ability to understand these symbols.<eos> Do you know who that might be?<eos> No, but Renard has a lot of friends in wry places.<eos> Have you decided if you're gonna tell him about the tunnel?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Nick, there's something I need to tell you about the night that Renard killed Bonaparte.
Have you decided if you're gonna tell him about the tunnel?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Nick, there's something I need to tell you about the night that Renard killed Bonaparte.<eos> That was a fun night.<eos> What?<eos> After it happened, Renard didn't know what he'd done until he saw the bloody sword in his hand.<eos> Yeah, he looked confused.<eos> Are you trying to make an excuse for him?<eos> No.<eos> I'm trying to tell you that...
Are you trying to make an excuse for him?<eos> No.<eos> I'm trying to tell you that...<eos> Diana made him do it, because she knew that Bonaparte had choked me.<eos> She can do that?<eos> She also caused the death of Rachel Wood.<eos> - I watched her.<eos> - How?<eos> She sort of... Brought me there telepathically.<eos> I'm telling you this because... I think we need to tell Renard about the tunnel.
How did you get in here?<eos> The stick.<eos> But it didn't come with me.<eos> - What is this place? - I don't know.<eos> Looks a lot like the Black Forest, actually, where we found the stick.<eos> Except the Wesen are different here.<eos> Yeah, they don't woge back after they die.<eos> Why did you do this?<eos> I wasn't gonna wait for the skull guy to come after us. You shouldn't have come here alone!<eos> You shouldn't have come after me.
I don't have that many bullets.<eos> Try and see if you can get some sleep now, honey.<eos> - But I want to help Nick.<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> We'll take care of it.<eos> What if Nick can't get back without the stick?<eos> I mean, the stick is how he got in.<eos> I know you guys don't think I should do this, but if it's Hexenbiest blood that got Eve in there, then I can get in there and maybe get them back out.<eos> - No.<eos> - Adalind, you can't.
Nick was adamant about going solo.<eos> Well, I'm adamant about getting him the hell out of there, whatever it takes.<eos> Well, it might take Renard.<eos> We really think he's gonna help us with this?<eos> He doesn't have a great record for helping anyone but himself.<eos> Yeah, how much are we telling him, exactly?<eos> Whatever he wants to know, because we are out of options.<eos> And who's going down in the tunnel with him?<eos> Well, Diana has to go down with me, but I don't wanna be down there alone with Renard.<eos> You won't be.
Am I going to Daddy's?<eos> No, sweetie, Daddy's just gonna help us find Nick and Eve.<eos> That would be good, Daddy.<eos> They're in a bad place.<eos> - Where are they?<eos> - The other place.<eos> What other place?<eos> Through the mirror.<eos> It took Hexenbiest blood to cross over.<eos> You got a lot of catching up to do.
It has everything to do with the keys.<eos> You got all seven?<eos> No, we got five, but... - It was enough. - No.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> Believe it.<eos> You found what the Crusaders buried in the 12th century?<eos> We did.<eos> What'd you find?<eos> Me too.<eos> Daddy, you like that?
Good thing you brought that.<eos> If I'd known I was gonna need this many bullets, I'd have brought more.<eos> Only three left.<eos> I'll check outside the perimeter.<eos> No, no, no. No, hey.<eos> We don't split up.<eos> We stay together.<eos> I don't want to be rescued, Nick.<eos> I came here for a reason.<eos> You can't take on the skull thing alone.
Nick, it's opening!<eos> Eve, ah!<eos> Nick!<eos> Eve!<eos> Eve, Nick!<eos> - Diana!<eos> - Nick!<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Mommy, it worked.<eos> I got Nick back for you.
I don't want any trouble, so just... aah!<eos> He's here.<eos> Honey, we're not gonna let anything happen to you, okay?<eos> Don't let him find me.<eos> Please, don't let him find me.<eos> Do you know where he is?<eos> We'll protect you, no matter what.<eos> You're safe. I promise.<eos> All of us.<eos> We're not gonna let anybody near you.
I know exactly where you can hide her.<eos> Where?<eos> The cabin in the woods where all of this first started.<eos> You mean where I took you to find that postman who kidnapped the little girl?<eos> That's his place.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And where you gave me the key.<eos> Nick!<eos> I brought the key.<eos> Here, I'm giving it back to you.
Rosalee and I will go with you.<eos> No, if Zerstoerer is connected to me, I should go alone.<eos> No, none of us are doing anything alone.<eos> Wu and I can go to the precinct and see if the Zerstoerer came through.<eos> I'm sure, wherever it was, somebody had to notice.<eos> Yeah, I bet he's hard to miss.<eos> This can't be good.<eos> I'm taking you somewhere to hide Diana.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> You can't stay with me.
- It's healing her.<eos> - I'm being hunted.<eos> I believe they're going to kill you... Two men waiting by your car.<eos> This time you chose the right side, Sean.<eos> Two dimensions exist simultaneously... One where the cat is alive, one where it's dead.<eos> As long as the box stays closed, both realities exist.<eos> - Eve, Nick!<eos> - Diana.<eos> Mommy, it works.<eos> I got Nick back for you.
Yeah, supposedly just this side of nuclear.<eos> Let's do it!<eos> All right, I just need a few more minutes to get it ready to go.<eos> This better work, 'cause I don't know how I'm gonna get close enough to him to cut his head off.<eos> Get me a thermos.<eos> I wonder who's collecting all these.<eos> If I remember, it was a postman.<eos> Blutbaden.<eos> Old school.<eos> Look, I want to tell you something.
You son of a bitch!<eos> Kelly!<eos> Decapitare.<eos> We're ready.<eos> My brother likes you, too.<eos> You've taken everything from me.<eos> You're not gonna take my son.<eos> That doesn't need to happen.<eos> None of this does.<eos> The stick is what you want.
We're ready.<eos> My brother likes you, too.<eos> You've taken everything from me.<eos> You're not gonna take my son.<eos> That doesn't need to happen.<eos> None of this does.<eos> The stick is what you want.<eos> It is.<eos> You can't kill me as long as I have it.<eos> I'm willing to give you something in exchange for it.
Nick, you can't give it to him.<eos> I want the people I love to live again.<eos> - Take it!<eos> - No, Nick!<eos> - Nick, no!<eos> - Don't!<eos> Nick!<eos> I understand what you want, but this'll be the end of humanity.<eos> This isn't about us or the ones we love.<eos> - I can't let you do this.
How'd you know I needed you?<eos> We feel it.<eos> Why do you think Theresa came back?<eos> She felt it, too.<eos> We are all descendents of the first Grimm.<eos> That stick you found... the one our Grimm ancestors buried...<eos> Is part of a much greater power.<eos> Guard it well.<eos> You kept me from doing something terrible.<eos> We helped you find your strength.
Who else?<eos> But I did nothing for them.<eos> Nick.<eos> Where did they go?<eos> Who?<eos> The other Grimms fighting with you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I can bring them all back to life.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> If it worked for you, it can work for them.
Nick, no!<eos> Nick!<eos> Nick, no!<eos> Nick, no!<eos> - Eve!<eos> - Nick?<eos> Nick?<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> Mommy, it worked.<eos> I got Nick back for you.
- And Wheal Grace.<eos> - Are you stalking me, Dr Enys?<eos> - Not at all.<eos> - I am a gentleman, sir.<eos> - And she is an heiress.<eos> I ask you to marry me.<eos> - Don't go there tonight.<eos> - Get out of my way.<eos> I love him to distraction and will marry him next month.<eos> - Do you not want her?
- Are you hurt?<eos> - No, not in the least.<eos> - Please let go.<eos> I can manage.<eos> - You could have been thrown.<eos> - Well, is it any of your concern?<eos> - You were in difficulty.<eos> - Would you rather I just abandon you?<eos> - Because that would be unheard of?<eos> I wish you nothing but good, Elizabeth.
Neither my wife nor my unborn child require your assistance.<eos> Must you turn everything into a battle, George?<eos> Lay hand or set foot on anything of mine again, and you will find the battle has barely begun.<eos> How looked Elizabeth?<eos> Must be near her time.<eos> - Or within a month of it.<eos> - I know little of these things.<eos> - And care even less?<eos> - Would you rather I care more?<eos> I'd rather there was one day in seven that you did not rise before dawn.
- How will it be managed?<eos> - With care and the utmost secrecy.<eos> Judas, I can scarce believe this day has come.<eos> It's far from over, and anything could go amiss.<eos> Well?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Who be this, then?<eos> - Prudie, this be my brother, Drake.<eos> - Good day, ma'am.<eos> How be you've escaped father's clutches?
Message from the mine. 'Ee have a visitor.<eos> Who's our mystery caller?<eos> - Ah! - Well, Uncle Ross.<eos> - Well, Nephew.<eos> - So, you've escaped your jailers?<eos> - Seeing you reminded me of Papa, so I thought, "Why should I not go and visit his mine?"<eos> - You're welcome any time.<eos> - So I should hope.<eos> After all, mining is in my blood.<eos> Your father must have told you, mining is hard.
That quacksalver?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> In any case, is he not at sea?<eos> - What of Dr Behenna?<eos> - Lives the other side of Truro.<eos> - Take time to summon him.<eos> - Let him be summoned.<eos> Demelza and I regret we have chores to attend to.<eos> Let me show you to your room.<eos> Do you like her?
Stay, you vermin!<eos> I would speak!<eos> That child of yours.<eos> What of him?<eos> Cursed he be!<eos> Born under the black moon.<eos> No good shall come to him!<eos> I have never known the blessing of a happy marriage... .. but it's been my privilege to have had the guardianship of you.<eos> Shh, uncle, do not exhaust yourself.<eos> Had I ever married, I might have understood what it is to follow one's heart and I should not have prevented you from doing so.
And since you've lost a part of your family, can you find it in you to embrace a part o' mine?<eos> My dear, you will be pleased to hear we are rid of him!<eos> - Who?<eos> - Ross.<eos> Finally he has admitted defeat.<eos> He will never again approach our house nor any member of our family.<eos> - He actually said that?<eos> - Hmm!<eos> A new chapter begins... without him.<eos> There's something I must tell you, Ross.

Since my ole man did cart off, old Prudie 'ave 'ad to tend to these needs herself.<eos> Not to mention other needs a body might 'ave.<eos> It seems a lifetime since I married Dwight.<eos> - Yet it's barely been a month.<eos> - He'll be home again soon.<eos> Won't he?<eos> "My most beloved wife, Caroline, I write with some trepidation.<eos> "The French fleet has been sighted not far from our present position "in the Channel.<eos> "Though it is impossible to know how soon we must engage with them" "yet we know that attack is inevitable."<eos> "I beg you not distress yourself for I have confidence that we" "will prevail and that I will soon return home to you, my love."
He must know that you're my brothers.<eos> Judas!<eos> Must it always be such a battle?<eos> Shake my hand, Geoffrey Charles.<eos> That's what young gentlemen do.<eos> Remember, Morwenna, keep him at his studies.<eos> Of course.<eos> And don't let him waste his time at cards.<eos> Wouldn't dream of it!<eos> I'll miss you, Mama.
Say good day to your daughter.<eos> Miss Clowance Poldark.<eos> It's the most precious gift I've ever received.<eos> Finally, a deal!<eos> Now all that remains is for you to inform the bride.
No one must hear of this.<eos> My son will not be deformed!<eos> George!<eos> Do not say that!<eos> Dr Choake believes he can be cured.<eos> There's to be a gathering at Tregothnan.<eos> Lord Falmouth's?<eos> The St Aubyns and Godolphins will be there.<eos> Our invitation is conspicuous by its absence.<eos> Are you so keen to go?
Tomorrow?<eos> Who knows?<eos> Geoffrey Charles' friend was here again.<eos> Yes, he called to bring some toads.<eos> He's very fond of Geoffrey Charles.<eos> And of you, too, or so I observed this afternoon.<eos> Love makes us careless, does it not?<eos> What do you imagine George would do if he found out?<eos> Yes, I am usually the first to defy him, but that's because I have little to lose.<eos> Do you?
Precious little.<eos> Ross wished it to remain secret till he returned.<eos> How can I keep it from Caroline?<eos> A fever?<eos> I must say you look none the worse for it.<eos> I think I must keep indoors tonight.<eos> I was hoping you'd bide with me.<eos> My dear, I'm beginning to look like a recluse.<eos> I must put in an appearance, with or without my escort!<eos> - Do you not like it?
The thought of freedom was too much for me.<eos> It was too much for us all.<eos> There's talk of a Royalist landing.<eos> Republican troops are mobilising.<eos> If we're caught now, there'll be no escape.<eos> And no mercy.<eos> Up!<eos> The power of an ancient family name!<eos> Chynoweths stroll in where Warleggans fear to tread.<eos> Did you manage to advance our cause?
Far less rich, far less profitable.<eos> Yet I see why you're so attached to her.<eos> You're kindred spirits.<eos> Both full of noise, but ultimately lacking in substance.<eos> Go on, Ross, tell me to get off your land.<eos> Wait!<eos> You can't.<eos> Because the land we're standing on belongs to the mine.<eos> And the mine belongs to me.<eos> How do you sleep at night, George?
Uncle George hates toads.<eos> He had them all cleared from our pond.<eos> Imagine if they ever came back!<eos> Geoffrey Charles, I'm not sure your Uncle George would approve.<eos> - Of the toad?<eos> - Of our guest.<eos> Aunt Agatha won't tell him, will you, Aunt?<eos> Did you know Geoffrey Charles's friend is related to my nephew?<eos> Of course you do.<eos> For Geoffrey Charles's friend tells you a great deal.
Geoffrey Charles and I are to go to Truro for Christmas.<eos> To Uncle George's?<eos> The carriage will come for us on Saturday.<eos> How long will you be gone?<eos> A few weeks?<eos> Maybe more.<eos> I'd come to bid you goodbye, but I must be at the christening.<eos> 'Tis my sister's child, Clowance.<eos> Your cousin, Master Geoffrey.<eos> If we're away for Christmas, I must give you your present now.
Is that wise?<eos> I have neglected her of late.<eos> You swore you'd keep your distance from all things Trenwith.<eos> Agatha is not all things Trenwith.<eos> She's a Poldark, and my aunt.<eos> George has brought Leisure to its knees and I'll be damned if he'll do the same to Agatha.<eos> So why shouldn't she come to my daughter's christening?<eos> I've sent the carriage for Morwenna and Geoffrey Charles, as you requested.<eos> - Geoffrey Charles, wait!<eos> - You needn't come!
If it's true.<eos> You forget, I've been a prisonerofwar myself.<eos> But Dwight's a doctor, will he not get special privileges?<eos> Let's hope so.<eos> I intend to open my house to all emigre nobles fleeing that wicked regime.<eos> It's the least I can do.<eos> She hates to feel useless.<eos> I know the feeling.<eos> What is it?<eos> Do you not like my gown?

They'll likely shoot you!<eos> Not if I'm with him.<eos> We shan't be long.<eos> Mama!<eos> You're very late.<eos> Go up and change before the guests arrive.<eos> - Guests?<eos> - For the ball.<eos> - But...<eos> - I've ordered a new dress for you.
- May I help you?<eos> - Morwenna?<eos> Marry...<eos> Mr Whitworth?<eos> Well, I need hardly enumerate the advantages of the match.<eos> The excellent prospects of the groom.<eos> Your immediate transformation from governess to lady of the town.<eos> The help it will be to your widowed mother and younger sisters.<eos> Mr Warleggan's generosity in providing the settlement.<eos> Do our kind thoughts displease you?
Roasting the Frenchies!<eos> Whatever next?<eos> A less perilous venture, Aunt.<eos> Clearing the long field at Nampara.<eos> Dull.<eos> Not for our starving miners.<eos> When George closed Wheal Leisure, many lost everything.<eos> If I can gift them the land, at least they can eat.<eos> George'll be disappointed.<eos> Perhaps you should inform him on your way out.
But...<eos> I'd hoped for more time.<eos> Miss Chynoweth, if you had any idea of the agony he suffers whilst awaiting your answer.<eos> He is quite distraught and hardly knows what to do with himself.<eos> I thought you'd be wed by now.<eos> The delay is deuced awkward.<eos> A man has needs, and if they remain unfulfilled by a wife, he must satiate them elsewhere.<eos> And, er, your intended?<eos> Do she have a sturdy or a gentle nature?<eos> What's that to you?
When Francis and Ross were boys, they loved toads!<eos> Ross especially.<eos> He would never have had them killed.<eos> But then, he was not for mindless destruction.<eos> Much prefers a rescue mission!<eos> In France he beat 20 men singlehanded.<eos> I believe the reports were exaggerated.<eos> And how do we know he didn't send in his men while he himself waited outside?<eos> You're not a soldier, George.<eos> You wouldn't understand.
Did he really say that?<eos> Do we doubt it?<eos> If we see a chance to give or take pleasure in this world... ought we not to seize it?<eos> But... surely we've no right to expect happiness?<eos> All we can do is our duty.<eos> I believe 'tis our duty to find happiness... in great things, or small.<eos> Like toads!<eos> Master Geoffrey!<eos> I'll return directly.<eos> You shouldn't have done it.
Is it Drake?<eos> Very like.<eos> Judas!<eos> Then he's walking straight into it!<eos> I must go and stop him!<eos> Nay, maid.<eos> Not a word to Ross!<eos> That way!<eos> After 'em!<eos> Prudie shouldn't have told you.
You let them escape and failed even to identify them?<eos> But of course it was Ross.<eos> I'm not an idiot!<eos> There's no one else would go out of their way to vex me in this manner.<eos> Did I mention I've good news from Harrow?<eos> Geoffrey Charles is to start there next term.<eos> A fine thought, is it not?<eos> A new home and new friends.<eos> Master Geoffrey!<eos> Did I hurt you?
What'll she do with herself when ee've gone?<eos> She'll have no time to think of me once she's wed.<eos> Wed?<eos> To who?<eos> A clergyman, I think.<eos> Uncle George arranged it.<eos> A Mr Whitworth?<eos> What do Miss Morwenna say?<eos> I don't believe she's overly keen, but Mama said it's a great match, so I expect she'll come around soon enough.<eos> You've been a great friend to me, Drake, so I've brought you a gift.
Consider all I've said.<eos> Give me an answer when you're ready.<eos> Soon, then.<eos> I will give it soon.<eos> Be it sacrilege to say so, I believe there be miracles after all.<eos> Of what nature?<eos> Miss Morwenna's to refuse Mr Whitworth and give her hand to you.<eos> Can it be so?<eos> When I've earned enough to provide for her.<eos> Ross and I could help you.
Drake's not the sort to steal, Ross.<eos> I'll go and plead before the magistrate myself.<eos> A good plan, but for one thing.<eos> The magistrate is George.<eos> What?<eos> Why else do you think he's arranged it this way?<eos> Not only will your pleas fall on deaf ears, he'll be all the more vicious with the sentencing.<eos> Judas, Ross!<eos> Why could you not have been magistrate?<eos> Why did you turn down the chance when 'twas offered?
I've failed.<eos> No, Sam.<eos> All these years I spent trying to snatch souls from the foul fiend, but I can't save my own brother from the noose.<eos> Of course I'll testify.<eos> Do you think it will do any good?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> But I can't let him die without a fight.<eos> You're a good friend, Ross.<eos> I won't forget what you did for me.<eos> I wish there was a way to repay you.
And since Miss Chynoweth seems blind to the advantages of our proposed match, I must beg to be released from my obligation.<eos> Of course, if you wish.<eos> One moment, sir.<eos> Would you excuse us for five minutes?<eos> By all means.<eos> Is this not good news?<eos> Now we need not tell him of Morwenna's disgrace.<eos> It is excellent news.<eos> But not for that reason.<eos> You know, do you not, that we wish only the best for you?
- I wish Drake and Sam would find contentment. - Have you found it?<eos> The old smith died last month.<eos> It's yours.<eos> I think ye still pine for the girl who be lost to ye.<eos> - I've missed you, sister!
My great aunt is dead.<eos> Bury her in a pauper's grave with no headstone?<eos> She WILL have a headstone.<eos> She was the last of the Trenwith Poldarks.<eos> Barring Geoffrey Charles.<eos> What is my offence, George?<eos> Since Aunt Agatha's death, there's scarce been two words between us.<eos> Of course I was unhappy that she was buried in haste, without due ceremony...<eos> We do not know what she died of -- my concern was solely about possible infection.<eos> .. and perhaps I was wrong in challenging you so vigorously -- but why should your displeasure extend to Valentine?
Once they get her, string's round her neck.<eos> Choose wisely, and it needn't be.<eos> Hmm. Can ye fettle this?<eos> I'll return tomorrow.<eos> Valentine, my sweet, shall we ask Papa if he'd like us to accompany him to Truro?<eos> Imagine him as a Member of Parliament!<eos> Papa is... going to Tregothnan.<eos> To see Lord Falmouth?<eos> To inform him of the burgesses' decision, and thence to Truro -- and an election is no place for children.<eos> May we wish you luck?
Are you here to congratulate me?<eos> I came to town with no other purpose.<eos> When do you take your seat?<eos> Er... next week.<eos> I shall take a house in London.<eos> Then we'll no longer be neighbours.<eos> Oh, during summer recess.<eos> If I cannot avoid it.<eos> But if Trenwith becomes surplus to requirements, - I may think of selling. - You should make him an offer.<eos> Don't waste your time -- it will never become available to you.
Now, now, sir.<eos> How does Geoffrey Charles at his new school?<eos> I fear he's inherited his father's idle habits.<eos> At school, as you recall, his father was cleverer than either of us.<eos> A promise he did not fulfil.<eos> I, of course, pay the whole cost of the boy's schooling, when he should by rights have sufficient income of his own.<eos> - From what?<eos> - His shares in your mine.<eos> Elizabeth sold his shares.<eos> Under pressure, to you, at a fraction of their worth.
It'll soon be over.<eos> - Just close your eyes and submit.<eos> - No, please!<eos> I confess, cousin, I'd hoped to see you stronger.<eos> I will be soon.<eos> It grieves me that I cannot nurse my baby.<eos> I wanted to, but Osborne insisted on a wet nurse.<eos> Rowella, can you take me to visit the child?<eos> Of course.<eos> I've missed you, Wenna.
I must go.<eos> Yes.<eos> Goodbye, Ross.<eos> I'd sooner make a wheel than learn stupid Latin declensions!<eos> It ain't only Latin, though.<eos> You're learnin' how to be a gentleman.<eos> And when I inherit Trenwith, you'll come and live there as my steward, and we'll make wheels together!<eos> I saw her today.<eos> She's had her child.<eos> She asked me to give you a message.
♪ Do not ask me for a kiss<eos> ♪ Life is short but love is long<eos> ♪ You may never know that bliss<eos> ♪ So I offer you this song<eos> ♪ Do not ask me for my heart<eos> ♪ Life is short but love is long<eos> ♪ Knowing we are soon to part<eos> ♪ Consolation be my song. ♪<eos> I must go up and rest.<eos> Before you do, sister, this came for you.
Should you like to sit down, Vicar?<eos> Oh, er... I think you would.<eos> Should you like me to sit on your lap?<eos> I'm not sure I...<eos> But of course you would.<eos> You seem far away.<eos> No more than you, when you returned from Sawle churchyard.<eos> We swore we'd keep no more secrets from each other, Ross.<eos> I have nothing to tell.<eos> Do you?
Oh, er... I think you would.<eos> Should you like me to sit on your lap?<eos> I'm not sure I...<eos> But of course you would.<eos> You seem far away.<eos> No more than you, when you returned from Sawle churchyard.<eos> We swore we'd keep no more secrets from each other, Ross.<eos> I have nothing to tell.<eos> Do you?<eos> Yes, though I think you will find it hard to hear.
Try me.<eos> I want to tell you that I wish I could be two people.<eos> One, your loving wife, the mother of your children, content in our life, as I am, and as I ever wish to be.<eos> And the other?<eos> Someone else, someone new... .. who could love another just for a day.<eos> "Another"?<eos> Laugh with him, kiss him, love him, just for a day, without feeling disloyal to the man I truly love.<eos> And do you think "another" would be content with that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Would you?
Sir Francis believes such corruption must be stopped.<eos> He intends to spearhead a campaign of reform and put up his own candidate to challenge Falmouth's.<eos> - And that candidate would be?<eos> - We'll see.<eos> We really will be off to hell in a hand-cart if George Warleggan goes to parliament!<eos> If a hand-cart is your preferred mode of transport, it can swiftly be arranged.<eos> I was disappointed in Killewarren.<eos> No chintz, no gilding.<eos> But the scale of the establishment puts our humble household to shame.<eos> I think you should have a companion to share the chores and assist you with the children.
We seldom stir abroad, sir.<eos> Then I hope you will make this the exception.<eos> Shall we say Saturday?<eos> Your wife will be gratified.<eos> I believe she enjoys high society these days.<eos> She has no spurious fame to contend with.<eos> Whereas I am only too aware it's the sole reason for my sudden popularity!<eos> Take her.<eos> What harm could it do?<eos> - I've missed you, sister!
When I was last at Sawle Church, I had occasion to glance at the parish register.<eos> I could find no record of your baptism in 1695.<eos> Of course, I was not content to leave it there, for baptisms do not always instantly follow births.<eos> So yesterday I had the servants comb the house until they found the old Poldark family Bible.<eos> And? What of it?<eos> Let me read you an entry.<eos> The ink is faded but I suppose it to be your father's handwriting.<eos> "Born to us this autumn morn, our first child, "a daughter, Agatha Mary.<eos> "September 14th, 1697."<eos> So you see, old crone, on Monday you will be but 98.
Nor do I.<eos> But you, your influence is great -- there's much good you could do.<eos> And is not Sir Francis a goodly man?<eos> Yes, but he too uses his power for his own ends and he would use me if I would let him.<eos> But I will not.<eos> Come in, Lucy Pipe, idle girl!<eos> Where's my supper? !<eos> There will be no supper, old woman.<eos> There will be no party.<eos> I'll have letters sent to all your guests informing them that you made a mistake, that you are 97 not 99, and a new invitation will be issued in two years' time.
How long do you think you can do as you please?<eos> - Plough your own furrow regardless of anyone else or I?<eos> - Demelza...<eos> Not once have you asked my advice or harkened to my opinion!<eos> - Not once!<eos> - What do you want, Demelza?<eos> A man who will lie down, roll over, sit up and beg for you?<eos> Well, if so, you've married the wrong man!<eos> 'Twould appear so!<eos> Perhaps you should look elsewhere for a pet.
They'll be spying out our defences, but... they'll be back.<eos> This threat from the French cannot be ignored.<eos> Cornwall is woefully unprepared for an enemy which is now at our door.<eos> Those men with military experience will form and train companies of volunteers to quell threat and disorder wherever it appears.<eos> When the hour comes -- and come it will -- we must not be found wanting.<eos> Truro is a key location...<eos> If she whom I desire would stoop to love me, I would come hand-in-hand, and, kneeling, ask that she kindly receive me...<eos> .. and deign to understand that all I have is hers... .. forever and a day.<eos> Press but her lips to mine... .. and never let love decay.<eos> You should not be here alone.
Press but her lips to mine... .. and never let love decay.<eos> You should not be here alone.<eos> The French have been sighted, and there's rumours of invasion.<eos> No doubt you'll take up the flag and lead the charge against them.<eos> And become a leader of men?<eos> I happen to agree with Sir Francis.<eos> I've seen what chaos revolution brings, and I do not wish that on Cornwall.<eos> I intend to visit Drake, Mama.<eos> My love, as you know, I've no objection to your visiting Mr Carne.<eos> He has a respectable trade and you seem fond of him.
Ah. Yes, indeed.<eos> God be praised.<eos> Though I would recommend a further period of abstinence.<eos> Of course!<eos> I'm relieved to hear you say so.<eos> But if I might suggest -- some more of that helpful tincture?<eos> To ensure her rest is undisturbed.<eos> If Mrs Whitworth has no objection.<eos> As you wish.<eos> My dear, why not rest a while before you enjoy my first sermon at Sawle Church this afternoon?

Tholly loves the sound of his own voice.<eos> If you do not challenge the corrupt and unjust, then commoners will rise -- and then you'll be powerless to help them.<eos> What would you have me do?<eos> I'd have you step up.<eos> I'd have you be great!<eos> I'd have you declare what you stand for!<eos> You would have me pontificate and play the hero -- and make some grand dramatic gesture.<eos> I am not that man, Demelza.<eos> I have never been that man.<eos> And if that's what you seek, I suggest you look elsewhere.
You'll also recall how I earned that promotion.<eos> By being the last man standing after the ambush at James Creek.<eos> One thing remains consistent -- your propensity for self-deprecation.<eos> You're principled and high-minded.<eos> But, sometimes, in order to affect change, hands must be dirtied.<eos> Forgive me, Vicar.<eos> I wish to let you know that I've written to the Bishop.<eos> I've asked him to pray for me.<eos> You haven't told him about your condition?<eos> He will never believe you.
In exchange for £500.<eos> You should never've let him go.<eos> 'Twas but a courtesy call, he said.<eos> Drake!<eos> Dear God.<eos> - Is he dead?<eos> - He's breathing.<eos> He's still breathin'!<eos> Get help! Go to Killewarren and fetch Dwight.<eos> You're lucky to be alive.
So...<eos> Blind?<eos> No.<eos> Nor half-witted neither.<eos> My sister is with child.<eos> Your child.<eos> Despite your attempts to sedate me, I have not been deaf all of the time.<eos> You must realise it was not my fault!<eos> That girl has some evil in her which makes a man possessed!<eos> But now, by the grace of God, I've returned to you.
Never.<eos> You have no right to deny me.<eos> I am your husband and you will do as I command.<eos> And I will kill your son!<eos> So help me God, if you do so much as approach me again, I will smother him.<eos> Merciful heaven!<eos> You don't believe I'll do it?<eos> Do you really want to take that chance?<eos> You've been ill, Morwenna, and I've no wish to see you relapse.<eos> I will leave you to think over your duty to me... .. and will pray to our Lord to grant you forgiveness.
His own son, changing' sides, pandering' to the pomp an' privileged?<eos> When the French arrive, you may wish to be elsewhere.<eos> There be no French.<eos> Only threat to us here is thee.<eos> Will 'ee not take a stand with us, brother?<eos> Will 'ee not show where thy loyalties lie?<eos> You know where this leads, Tholly.<eos> Bloodshed, riot.<eos> We've both seen it.<eos> So go now and no harm will come to you.
Tell me why you treat your son as if he were not your son?<eos> Is he my son?<eos> Who else's could he be?<eos> Now you see how jealousy is eating you up?<eos> I cannot abide it.<eos> I will not abide it.<eos> No.<eos> No, Elizabeth, please, I...<eos> I swear that I have never given myself to another man, except my first husband, Francis, and you.<eos> But of course even that will not satisfy you!
But when I did not, I began to think life has some purpose that I knowed not till now.<eos> Why think 'ee so?<eos> For this day I found green shoots coming up out o' season.<eos> And what shoots they be?<eos> Winter primroses.<eos> Well, Ross.<eos> My compliments to the Volunteers.<eos> I believe they were put to good use today.<eos> Oh, did you think you were being summoned to fight the Frenchies?<eos> No, it seems Tom Harry got the better of you.
Good morning, Sunshine.<eos> Or not.<eos> I bought that painting at a gallery in Munich.<eos> Okay, I'll have Ken take it down for you.
Okay, let's focus on the positive.<eos> I'm doing the evaluating, and my motto is,<eos> "Do your best and don't stress."<eos> Incoming.<eos> Hey. Lay off Cassie.<eos> Bro, she ditched you for that suit.<eos> Why you defending her?<eos> Because if she was a guy, you'd be high-fiving her.<eos> This evaluation is serious.<eos> Lame jokes aren't gonna win you any points.
Oh. Don't worry, Dr. Scott. I will not slap you.<eos> Unless, of course, you screw up.<eos> What's the occasion?<eos> I'm just giving back to my staff who has given me so much.<eos> You want your old job back, don't you?<eos> I do.<eos> Our former CEO finally saw the error in his ways.<eos> Sorry. Former?<eos> Thomas resigned this morning.<eos> Obviously, he hasn't told you.
Thomas resigned this morning.<eos> Obviously, he hasn't told you.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> I need to focus on the surgery.<eos> Good.<eos> Yo, Samuel.<eos> You lost?<eos> I wanted to see the operation.<eos> Oh, no, man.<eos> You're not allowed.
Yes. You'll be late to your pitch.<eos> Listen, I gave him a cookie, but he barely ate it.<eos> Maybe he really is sick.<eos> He's probably just not hungry.<eos> - Um, wish me luck.<eos> - Yes. Good luck.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I saved you one of the good ones.
Let's find you some help.<eos> When my mom died, we said we'd look after each other.<eos> He spends all his time with me.<eos> Gave up everything.<eos> He's really there for you.<eos> I just... I wanna show him that I can be there for him, too.<eos> That I'm strong enough.<eos> I'm sure he knows that.<eos> You know, there's strength in knowing your limits.<eos> I know you're scared, even if you got your game face on.
I'm sure he knows that.<eos> You know, there's strength in knowing your limits.<eos> I know you're scared, even if you got your game face on.<eos> And you both have needs.<eos> It doesn't help your dad to pretend you don't.<eos> Dr. Scott, why don't you show Samuel to his father?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> Cassie.<eos> Does that look straight to you?
I'm really sorry that you're leaving like this.<eos> Good news travels fast, huh?<eos> It's okay.<eos> I can use the time.<eos> I'm gonna get my head straightened out.<eos> Figure out how I let this happen.<eos> You've got to let it go, Thomas.<eos> You know, everyone keeps saying that, but... no one actually believes it.<eos> So that's that, then, huh?<eos> Cassie, I'm sorry if I made things harder for you here.
No, it's, um...<eos> the thing is that Marjorie and I have decided that we wanna have a baby, - and we'd like to do it...<eos> - I will give you my sperm.<eos> - Oh, great!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I thought that would take a lot longer.<eos> - No.<eos> Is there anything else that you wanna talk about?<eos> - I'm good.<eos> - Well, we'll send you the details.
Your dad was elected the previous year, So you weren't working on the campaign.<eos> Well, I was also really busy with sports.<eos> So, you were lying when you said amy broke up with you. Because you were busy with your dad's campaign.<eos> No, I wasn't lying.<eos> I had been working on the campaign.<eos> The year before.<eos> Yes, and then I got really busy with sports. Which is it?<eos> Sports or the campaign?<eos> Well, if you give me a chance to explain...<eos> I keep giving you chances and you keep lying. I'm not lying.
Yes, and then I got really busy with sports. Which is it?<eos> Sports or the campaign?<eos> Well, if you give me a chance to explain...<eos> I keep giving you chances and you keep lying. I'm not lying.<eos> It's complicated.<eos> Two minutes.<eos> That's all it took. For him to rattle you.<eos> He's gonna need a q-tip.<eos> He's gonna need a lot more than that.<eos> We'll give you a q-tip.
You want the case? Go for it.<eos> I told him to stop hovering and let you try your case.<eos> Good. Well, you do have a strong case, don't you?<eos> Well, now you're hovering.<eos> Well, he's a friend.<eos> Nonconsensual sexual activity is a hot button issue, And markes would love to make his name. As the guy who keeps the world safe.<eos> So... The brennan case.<eos> You're sure you can handle that?<eos> Yes.<eos> Since you were five, I could tell when you were lying.
Objection... speculation!<eos> And it's none of your damn business!<eos> You are the defendant. You don't get to object.<eos> Well, somebody had to.<eos> Counselor, talk to your client.<eos> Happy to.<eos> You are not in charge here.<eos> I know what you want.<eos> You want me to be quiet and obedient. A docile old man.<eos> You'd really like that, wouldn't you? I know carly certainly would.
I just want darryl to get his 26.<eos> So what now?<eos> Now... We drink.<eos> We're almost done here.<eos> Why don't you go home, I'll finish up.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I'll just go home, Get some sleep, and then come back tomorrow morning. And you'll have taken all the credit for my assignment.<eos> I'm not trying to...<eos> No. That's the thing.<eos> I mean, you don't even have to.
It's almost 7:00.<eos> I have to get to my sister's place in weehawken,<eos> And the next train leaves at... I...<eos> You're never gonna make it back in time.<eos> Weehawken?<eos> I'm not a snitch.<eos> We got to win this case.<eos> You always win for me.<eos> This isn't a misdemeanor.<eos> You're facing real jail time.
We got to win this case.<eos> You always win for me.<eos> This isn't a misdemeanor.<eos> You're facing real jail time.<eos> 25 to life.<eos> We could go to trial, But it's not gonna be easy.<eos> If I do this, I can never go back.<eos> That's my neighborhood.<eos> Those are my people.<eos> You're 21 years old, darryl.
That's all.<eos> Billy, take a seat.<eos> Hey. I've got to be in the o.R. In 30.<eos> What's up? I'm rescheduling renee lopez's surgery. And asking healy to take over.<eos> Can I ask why?<eos> It'll be for the best.<eos> He'll do fine. I've done this surgery hundreds of times.<eos> He's done it, what, six?<eos> All due respect, I taught him the technique.<eos> With your trial coming up, you know, you've got a lot. On your mind, so take as much time as you need...
I already spoken to the d.A.<eos> They're relocating him and alicia to arizona.<eos> Who'd you get to represent him?<eos> Me.<eos> I wasn't going to be the latest in a long line of people. Who've abandoned that kid.<eos> Isaiah could fire you for this.<eos> I know.<eos> Okay then.<eos> I'm going into court with you.<eos> I'm not gonna let you hang out to dry.
It isn't easy.<eos> I am a great lawyer.<eos> I just won.<eos> Judge porter gets to see his wife because of me.<eos> I got a home health aide. Qualified as an expert, And I made judge porter seem like a human being to a jury.<eos> That's how great of a lawyer I am!<eos> And great lawyers take risks.<eos> Like I did with the dna.<eos> And you know what?<eos> It's that risk that is gonna win us this case, So I you need to stop being so angry with me. Just because you disagreed with my decision to test billy's dna.
I treated her like crap.<eos> I didn't care about her feelings or anyone's for that matter.<eos> I was a spoiled, selfish, entitled, little bastard,<eos> And I know I should have said something before, but I was... Ashamed.<eos> I'm not that proud of who I was back then.<eos> I didn't want you to know.<eos> Also, i... I...<eos> I have done a lot of work to become a different person, A better person.<eos> I mean, I'm the guy that can save a kid's life... But I lost my job today, So now I'm just a guy...<eos> Who needs his life saved. So, I am gonna trust you and give you whatever it takes. So you can do your job.
And we'd be living an ordinary life.<eos> You know what?<eos> Let-let's talk next week, I'm tired.<eos> I-I upset you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You can't come in here. And lob your "what-ifs,". Because you get to leave and i...<eos> I regret a man died because of my actions.<eos> I regret that I never got to see sadie grow up.<eos> That I had to watch you, My attorney, raise her, bring her to me every saturday, And then take her home to a life of dinners and homework.<eos> Sometimes I regret. Falling in love with you, Because I see how painful it is for you to come here.
But things have changed.<eos> We're on the same side now.<eos> If this Saint isn't stopped, if Genesis is destroyed, chances are we're never gonna find God.<eos> I understand.<eos> This is serious.<eos> I don't know what happened to me.<eos> I used to be happy.<eos> Until I came to this place, this Earth, all I knew was peace.<eos> But now?<eos> And this is my only hesitation at helping you, Preacher, my only hesitation whatsoever...
I studied incredibly hard the last time.<eos> Did you study hard, or did your fiance study hard for you?<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> This has to be some kind of record...<eos> - Louis. - It's his.<eos> You make impulsive decisions, and you go back on them all the time.<eos> - This is different.<eos> - How? Because it's a baby.<eos> You want to merge?<eos> Jessica, you got knocked down the mountain.
Louis, I'm gonna be a Litt, which means our children are going to be Litts.<eos> You really mean that?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> Tara, I got to get going.<eos> Wh... what's wrong?<eos> Nothing's wrong.<eos> Jessica left last night, which means Harvey and I got to figure out what we're gonna do.<eos> Dad, what are you doing here?<eos> I know I'm a little early.<eos> But I came to bring you... a graduation present.
You stood in front of me once begging me to hire you, and I did.<eos> And now I'm asking you to do the same thing, and you're telling me to go screw myself.<eos> That's not what I'm doing and you know it.<eos> Mike, I need this.<eos> Look, I'm sorry, Harvey, I... I can't.<eos> I just can't.<eos> Harvey, where you been?<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Louis, if you're here to tell me our bank account is empty and we're on our knees, then I need to have this conversation some other time.<eos> Well, you're in luck because I'm here to tell you the opposite.
Jessica left.<eos> I need him, and he's hanging me out to dry.<eos> He's not hanging anyone out to dry.<eos> And in case you forgot, he went to prison.<eos> So he's probably trying to figure out a way to make up for what put him there in the first place.<eos> That's my point, Donna.<eos> He's a convicted criminal.<eos> I don't care if he tries Mother Teresa.<eos> Any place he goes isn't gonna give him the time of day, which means he's not gonna be able to do good for anyone.<eos> Then maybe instead of telling me why he'll never be able to accomplish his dream, you should be figuring out a way to help him do it.
Mike Ross got out of prison.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, there's no reason he shouldn't be able to practice law again.<eos> I don't disagree, but technically, he didn't practice it in the first place.<eos> Well, that's exactly why I'm here.<eos> If Mike's gonna have a chance to pass the character portion of the bar, he's gonna need someone like you to testify on his behalf.<eos> Someone like me?<eos> Or me?<eos> I didn't fly all the way up here for someone like you.<eos> Harvey, I'd love to help, but you know as well as I do, I'm not the one you should be coming to.<eos> You're exactly who I should be coming to.
Cracks me up that our teacher was in prison last week.<eos> All right, well, now that we've all had our fun, why don't we open up our textbooks?<eos> Chapter seven, Battle of Appomattox.<eos> We did that yesterday.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Father Walker gave me your syllabus.<eos> This is what we're covering today.<eos> Come on.<eos> Yeah, well, we all forgot our books.<eos> Well, then I guess we have no choice but for you to read from mine.
Well, then I guess we have no choice but for you to read from mine.<eos> I just have one question before I read.<eos> You ever drop the soap in the shower?<eos> Donna, do you mind calling Dr. Lipschitz for me?<eos> Gretchen's at her grandson's play.<eos> I know where Gretchen is, Louis.<eos> I've been answering her phone all morning.<eos> Now, would you like to tell me why a "Katroina Bonnet" just called to say Operation Fly The Coop was a resounding success?<eos> Sounds like the wrong number.<eos> It sounds like you just got Katrina Bennett's help poaching half Robert Zane's associates.
What's that supposed to mean?<eos> It means that Gretchen's still out, and I need you to set up a meeting with Jeremy Cohen.<eos> Louis, that's Zane's biggest client.<eos> I know he goddamn is.<eos> He's about to be my biggest client.<eos> I don't believe this.<eos> You're trying to tell the world that you should be managing partner, and the first thing you do is burn every bridge in sight?<eos> I don't care if I burn every bridge ever built.<eos> I am not letting Robert Zane come in here and push me around the day after Jessica leaves.<eos> So get Jeremy Cohen on the goddamn phone, Donna, or I'm not gonna forget you didn't.
Louis, that's Zane's biggest client.<eos> I know he goddamn is.<eos> He's about to be my biggest client.<eos> I don't believe this.<eos> You're trying to tell the world that you should be managing partner, and the first thing you do is burn every bridge in sight?<eos> I don't care if I burn every bridge ever built.<eos> I am not letting Robert Zane come in here and push me around the day after Jessica leaves.<eos> So get Jeremy Cohen on the goddamn phone, Donna, or I'm not gonna forget you didn't.<eos> Then don't forget it, Louis.<eos> Because when this comes back to bite you in the ass, I want you to remember that I tried to stop you and you didn't listen.
That's the reason that I'm here and he's not.<eos> So we can get to work... or we can spend the morning sharing our memories of a man who spent the last 40 years giving his life to kids like you and me.<eos> Third grade.<eos> Camping trip to Lake Kanawauke.<eos> Fishing with a stick.<eos> He's still fishing with a stick?<eos> Still coming up empty.<eos> He taught me how to swim on that trip.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> I don't mean to interrupt you, but I'm pretty sure you didn't mean to leave this in the McKenzie file.
Yeah, me too.<eos> I don't mean to interrupt you, but I'm pretty sure you didn't mean to leave this in the McKenzie file.<eos> My God.<eos> Gretchen, I'm sorry to put you in this position, but I have to ask you to please don't tell anyone.<eos> You don't have to ask me anything.<eos> What you do is your business.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> It's not what you think.<eos> Doesn't matter what I think.<eos> You got to take care of yourself.
You got to take care of yourself.<eos> If my father offered me a job in a firm with my name on it, well, I'd be leaving things in files by mistake too.<eos> Gretchen?<eos> If this was just about that, then I... I wouldn't be thinking twice.<eos> I would just tell him no.<eos> Then if you don't mind my asking, what is it about?<eos> My father thinks I have a better chance of getting past the bar if I'm not still working at the firm that hired Mike.<eos> But you're loyal to the people here, and you don't want to leave them.<eos> Yes, but if it means that I can't... be a lawyer at all, I...<eos> I can't help you with that part of the equation.

That's Zane's biggest client.<eos> Yeah, that's exactly why we're going after him.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Whatever time you set up that meeting,<eos> I guarantee you, Jeremy Cohen called Robert two minutes later, which means we need to figure out a way to make amends.<eos> No, I don't need to make amends.<eos> I need to make a statement, and that statement is,<eos> "Do not mess with the new managing partner of Pearson Specter Litt."<eos> Louis, that is the wrong statement to make.<eos> And if you insist on making it, I won't come work for you.
What the hell are you talking about?<eos> I'm talking about Jeremy Cohen!<eos> I don't know anything about Jeremy Cohen, and I'm not trying to poach anyone.<eos> Then you're even less prepared to be a leader than I thought, because your partner's out there coming after my firm, and you don't even know it!<eos> Maybe Louis wouldn't be doing that if you hadn't come here with some bullshit merger designed to rip us apart.<eos> Are you really that stupid?<eos> Are you really telling me that isn't what you wanted?<eos> If I wanted to rip you apart, you'd be in million pieces right now, because Jessica is gone, and you're not in my league.<eos> I offered the merger because my daughter has some kind of misguided loyalty to you, and I didn't want to extinguish that spark in her.<eos> If I'm not in your league, why is she loyal to us instead of you?
I know that.<eos> But the real reason we're having this conversation is that you're afraid to say it.<eos> It's up to you, Harvey.<eos> Either step up and take the reins or start looking for another job, because if you don't tell Louis he's not ready to run this firm, we're gonna be out of business one way or the other.<eos> What the hell did you do?<eos> Mike, not now.<eos> I'm not in the mood.<eos> Well, I wasn't in the mood when I got home to find Anita Gibbs waiting for me.<eos> - Mike, I'm sorry.<eos> - You're sorry?
- Mike, I'm sorry.<eos> - You're sorry?<eos> She came to my house to tell me that if I even so much as try to get a job at a legal clinic, she's gonna make it her life's mission to stop me.<eos> - She can't do that.<eos> - Did you hear me?<eos> I wasn't even on her radar.<eos> I had one thing I wanted to do, and you ruined it for me just because you can't accept the fact that I don't want to come back here.<eos> I wasn't trying to get you back.<eos> I was trying to help...<eos> I don't believe you!
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.<eos> You couldn't even shine Jessica's shoes and now you're trying to tear her legacy down.<eos> I was trying to live up to her legacy.<eos> Yeah, I don't give a shit what you think you've been doing.<eos> - Harvey, please.<eos> - You know what?<eos> Just let me say what I was gonna...<eos> I don't care what you were going to say to me, Louis, because all you care about is proving to me that you should be managing partner when everyone in the world knows that you shouldn't... Me, Robert Zane, even Donna.<eos> Harvey, please!<eos> Jessica didn't even want your name up on the wall, so if you think I'm gonna let you be managing partner while she's still breathing, you're out of your goddamn mind!
Honestly, Louis, I am swamped.<eos> So if it can wait until tomorrow...<eos> I wish it could, but it can't.<eos> - Is everything okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Except for one thing.<eos> I have been derelict in my duties as head of the associates.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Rachel, you've given your heart and soul to this firm for almost ten years, and now that you're about to become a lawyer...<eos> I'd like to formally extend you an offer to work here as soon as you graduate.
I...<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I think you do.<eos> You're right.<eos> Yes, Louis.<eos> I accept your offer.<eos> All right, you drive a hard bargain.<eos> Third-year associate it is.<eos> Thank you, Louis.<eos> No, thank you, Rachel.
- You told me that painting was the one happy memory you had of your mother.<eos> Every application I filled out today asked if I was a convicted felon.<eos> None of these places are gonna hire me after I check that box.<eos> A legal clinic isn't the only way to get back.<eos> Are you offering me a teaching job?<eos> - I am.<eos> - You think this is funny?<eos> Cracks me up that our teacher was in prison last week.<eos> All you care about is proving to me that you should be managing partner, when everyone in the world knows that you shouldn't.<eos> So, if you think I'm gonna let you be managing partner, you're out of your goddamn mind!
You'll bottle it up, and you'll try to move on, but...<eos> She's gonna be there, Donna.<eos> I know she is.<eos> But this funeral isn't about her.<eos> And it's not about you.<eos> It's about your dad... the man you love more than anyone in the entire world.<eos> And if you don't say good-bye to him, you're gonna regret that for the rest of your life.<eos> Donna, what are you doing here?<eos> The question is, what are you still doing here?<eos> I made you an 8:00 reservation to Boston, which means you should be halfway there by now.
What if I can't do it?<eos> Then don't get on that plane.<eos> But that bag sitting over there tells me that you're ready to forgive her.<eos> And if you are, then that's all you need to do.<eos> - Nathan.<eos> - You remember me.<eos> I remember everyone.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I'm here because I may not have been there when you dropped off your résumé, but I still run that clinic.<eos> I'm here to offer you a job.
So you knew that I faked being a lawyer twice, and you're still here to offer me a job?<eos> I wouldn't be, except for this.<eos> You told the truth.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, that means you're worth taking a chance on.<eos> Wow, you really are a do-gooder.<eos> I'm not here to do good for you.<eos> I'm here to do good for my clinic, because I'm hiring a partner-level attorney from one of the top firms in the city for the price of the kid who gets me my coffee.<eos> You have a kid who gets you coffee?<eos> No, we can't afford that.<eos> But if we could, I'd pay him what I'm gonna pay you.
Just so we're clear... I'm that guy.<eos> I get the picture.<eos> - Welcome to the clinic, Mike.<eos> - Thanks, Oliver.<eos> - I see you met Oliver here.<eos> - I did.<eos> We got along right away.<eos> Good, good.<eos> Well, you're off to a good start.<eos> I guess the only thing left is for you to show me where my desk is.
- I see you met Oliver here.<eos> - I did.<eos> We got along right away.<eos> Good, good.<eos> Well, you're off to a good start.<eos> I guess the only thing left is for you to show me where my desk is.<eos> Right.<eos> It's, right inside that office right there.<eos> I didn't think I was getting an office.<eos> Look, just because I'm paying you dick doesn't mean I'm not gonna give you the tools for the job.
Aren't you still a law student?<eos> A law student who's won every case I've had since I've been here.<eos> Great, so I guess that means you have everything under control on the Price case, then?<eos> You just got here.<eos> How did you...<eos> I'm a fast reader.<eos> Marissa, I'm not trying to throw my weight around here on the first day, but according to her file, Miss Price missed her court date, which means I need to know what your plan is.<eos> My plan is to have Miss Price explain that she is a single mother living in an apartment with a broken window and no heat for months, and they're trying to kick her out.<eos> And if all you're gonna do is tell the judge that it's not fair, you're gonna lose.<eos> You need legal foundation.
You're not helping Harvey, Louis.<eos> You're helping the firm.<eos> Teddy is a client of all of us.<eos> No, Harvey made it clear that there is no us.<eos> Louis, Harvey's going through something right now.<eos> His outburst wasn't about you.<eos> You can believe whatever you want, but Harvey lashed out at me, and now he's not even man enough to come to me to ask me for help himself?<eos> Why should I even lift a finger to help him?<eos> Because he went to go make things right with his mother.<eos> And he did it because of how he felt after he lashed out at you.
What's going on?<eos> Rachel.<eos> I thought you weren't getting home till 8:00.<eos> - It's 8:30.<eos> - I guess I lost track of time.<eos> I have just been buried in this paperwork.<eos> Yeah, I can see that.<eos> Are we being audited?<eos> I got a job.<eos> And I would have called you right away, but I've been swamped from the minute I walked into the clinic.
You said 3:00, so I called her in at 2:30 because I knew you wouldn't give me the chance to meet her, just like I know the other side is gonna approach her when you're not there.<eos> - They can't do that.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because it's unfair?<eos> - Because it's illegal.<eos> - Only if she pursues them, which she'll never do because they're gonna find out whatever her weak spots are, and then they're gonna offer her exactly the amount she needs to get by, and then she's gonna take it.<eos> If she does that, she'll end up homeless.<eos> Which is why we need to be prepared for it to happen.<eos> Now, do you want to work on this thing together or not?<eos> I'm sorry I didn't tell you that she was gonna speak before you got here.
Not only are we gonna get your window fixed, but I promise you, you'll get to keep your home, too.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You just told her you were gonna fix her problem.<eos> Because I'm going to fix her problem.<eos> That's not the point.<eos> Even if you think you can make everything better, you don't guarantee that to a client.<eos> You know what?<eos> Maybe you don't care about these people, but I do.
You know what?<eos> Maybe you don't care about these people, but I do.<eos> God.<eos> And I'm willing to fight to make sure they stay in their home, and I'm not afraid to tell her that.<eos> This is not about caring.<eos> There's a real world out there, and like I told you, there's an experienced lawyer on the other side looking to exploit our mistakes.<eos> If you over-promise and under-deliver, you're just making them that much more vulnerable to a shitty offer.<eos> Is that what they taught you in Corporate Lowballing 101?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You don't give a shit about these people, and Nathan and everyone else here might be buying your bullshit, but I know why you're really here.
Thank you, Oliver.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You made your strawberry pie.<eos> It was his favorite.<eos> Maybe you forgot it was mine, too.<eos> I didn't forget.<eos> It was a nice speech.<eos> Thank you, Harvey.<eos> Harvey... when my parents died,<eos> I felt like I was completely alone in the world. I don't want you to feel that way.
Harvey, please.<eos> We were just about...<eos> Yeah, I don't care what we were about to do.<eos> You spit in Dad's face by bringing him here.<eos> I-it's okay.<eos> Lily, I'll go.<eos> I don't care whether you stay or not.<eos> No, well, I do, and he is staying, because you may not want to hear this, but your father accepted him a long time ago.<eos> You know what?<eos> You want to take his place, Bobby, why don't you go right ahead?
For what?<eos> For the last time I saw you and for you being gone all those years.<eos> I had my reasons to be gone.<eos> Yes, you did, when you were younger, but you're not a child anymore, and you haven't been for a long time.<eos> I can't believe you.<eos> You're turning this around on me?<eos> I'm not turning it around, Harvey.<eos> You have no idea what it's like to have a child who acts like you don't even exist.<eos> You don't know what it's like to have a mother who asks you to lie to his own father for her.<eos> Harvey, I never should have done that, and I have been trying to tell you I am sorry about it for 20 years, but until yesterday, you made it clear to me that you had no interest in whether I lived or died.
- Because I didn't.<eos> - Well, can't you understand how that could devastate a person?<eos> I can understand how this was just a mistake, because you are the same selfish, self-centered, disloyal woman you always were.<eos> And you are the same self-absorbed, childish man you always were.<eos> Well, whose fault is that?<eos> There you go.<eos> Leave.<eos> That's what you do best.<eos> What'd you just say to me?<eos> I said take a look in the mirror, Harvey, because I may have neglected my family in the past, but you've been doing it for as long as I can remember.
If that's her, you tell her I've got nothing more to say.<eos> You know what, Harvey?<eos> You can tell her yourself, because I'm doing being in the middle of you two.<eos> Bobby.<eos> Where is he?<eos> - Hey, now's not the time.<eos> - You son of a bitch.<eos> You think you can just walk into our lives and... and rip open old wounds?<eos> Your lives?<eos> You better get the hell out of my face before I do something that you'll regret.
You didn't have to do that.<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> Hey.<eos> You're still here.<eos> My flight isn't for another two hours.<eos> I wasn't gonna let that asshole drive me away.<eos> Listen, Harvey, about what Bobby said last night...<eos> You don't need to make excuses for him, Marcus.<eos> I'm not making excuses.<eos> I'm telling you he had every right to say what he said to you.
What?<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Why would I?<eos> So that we could have this at the same time?<eos> - Marcus...<eos> - No, listen to me.<eos> You know who helped out when Katie was taking me to chemo?<eos> Mom made dinner every night.<eos> Bobby took my kids to school every day, which means... while they might be monsters to you, to my kids, they're Grandma and Grandpa.<eos> And you might not like that shit coming from Bobby, but it's the truth, Harvey... whether you want to hear it or not.

Harvey.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Depends on why you're here.<eos> I'm here to apologize for the way I acted last night.<eos> Is this 'cause Bobby came to see you?<eos> No, it's because Marcus got sick, and you took care of him, and he couldn't even tell me that.<eos> - Harvey...<eos> - I'm so angry.<eos> I don't want to be angry anymore, but I don't know how to stop.<eos> Then let me say how sorry I am for all the pain that I have caused you.
No, Louis.<eos> You never know.<eos> What are you two still doing here?<eos> We've still got 12 hours.<eos> We're not going to stop trying to keep Sofia in her apartment.<eos> Good for you.<eos> But you don't have to do it tonight.<eos> Turns out she got a little grace period.<eos> How did she get that?<eos> It's amazing what you can do when you care about your clients.
- His client hasn't paid her rent in three months.<eos> - She's had no heat, and a broken window all winter despite repeated requests for repair.<eos> - We don't have it in writing, which is what the court requires.<eos> - I'd like to request time to confer with my supervisor.<eos> - You have to help him.<eos> - I can't. - We are requesting permission to evict if we don't have a check by 10:00 A.M. tomorrow.<eos> - $3,600.<eos> - Should be enough to cover your rent for the last three months.<eos> - This is a job offer.<eos> - When you graduate, you're gonna have to pass the character of fitness test.
- $3,600.<eos> - Should be enough to cover your rent for the last three months.<eos> - This is a job offer.<eos> - When you graduate, you're gonna have to pass the character of fitness test.<eos> - And you think working at your firm looks better than working at mine.<eos> - You're gonna tell me you had nothing to do with Harvey asking me to help you get a law license.<eos> - I wasn't even on her radar.<eos> I had one thing I wanted to do, and you ruined it for me, just because you can't accept the fact that I don't wanna come back here.<eos> I was trying to help you.<eos> - I don't believe you.
Dresses shitty?<eos> She have man purse?<eos> - Are you done?<eos> - Why?<eos> You have someplace you gotta be?<eos> - Actually, i am supposed to stay away from our apartment for awhile.<eos> - So anyway, I said to Louis, "i don't care "if most of the associates start in the bullpen. I'm not giving up my office."<eos> - That's great, Rachel, but I'm on my third glass of chardonnay, and I don't think you called me over here to tell me you submitted your application to the bar, or that you're putting your foot down with Louis.<eos> You're right.<eos> I called you over here to tell you that... I put my foot down with Mike.
- Mike. You don't need to go to Nathan.<eos> I can handle this.<eos> - Listen, I appreciate that--<eos> - I get it.<eos> I shit the bed the other day.<eos> - Oliver-- - look, Mike.<eos> I admit, sometimes I get flustered in court.<eos> But the law's clear on this. It's a layup.<eos> If we have a pending lawsuit, it puts an automatic hold on the eviction.<eos> I'm telling you i can handle this.

Get your ass down to court.<eos> Let me know as soon as it's done.<eos> What the hell did you do to my computer?<eos> - I didn't do anything to it,<eos> - If that's your idea of increasing performance, then you ought to rethink your career, because that thing has crashed more times than Mel Gibson on his way home from a Saturday night.
to give her an interview.<eos> - No, I got her the interview, but the vote has to unanimous, and he's putting a price on his vote.<eos> - What does he want?<eos> - He wants us to fabricate a lawsuit against his biggest competitor.<eos> - Jesus Christ, that's not an ask, that's a criminal action.<eos> - You think I don't know that?<eos> - Okay, Harvey, if we find a legitimate suit, it doesn't have to be illegal, which means, under the circumstances, maybe it's worth doing.<eos> - I'm not doing shit until I know the full story on this guy.<eos> - Harvey, this is Rachel's future we're talking about.<eos> - Yeah, I know it is, but I'm telling you this isn't all he wants, and I'm not going to agree to anything until I know what the hell it really is.

You are.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Louis, you were man enough to admit to me that I'm better at fixing things.
- Sofia, going to court is always risk.<eos> - Our lives have been one risk after another.<eos> - This check isn't a risk.<eos> This is real money.<eos> - how much could we get if we win?<eos> - Absolute best case-- $500,000-- but I'm telling you-- - please, Mr. Ross.<eos> They did this to him, and if we have a chance to change his life, we need to take it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Louis, can I help you?<eos> - I was just thinking about when I stood here years ago, and I had to tell you that you weren't gonna get into Harvard.
Whatdoyouneed,hotpants ?<eos> - What--what is that?<eos> - It's a device called the Donna that Benjamin's working on, and it's awesome.<eos> Go ahead, ask it something.<eos> - I don't wanna ask it something.<eos> I wanna ask you something.<eos> TheDonna:<eos> If by you,you mean muchbetterthanyou .<eos> - See?<eos> What did I tell you?
I wanna ask you something.<eos> TheDonna:<eos> If by you,you mean muchbetterthanyou .<eos> - See?<eos> What did I tell you?<eos> - Donna, I'm serious.<eos> Look, this is a really cute joke, but can I please just have a conversation with my friend?<eos> TheDonna:<eos> If by friend, youmean- of course you can, Rachel.<eos> What do you need?
- So let me get this straight, you're in love with a woman that you've known for about ten minutes.<eos> She's having another man's baby, and yet, you're gonna marry her, and raise it as your own.<eos> - In a nutshell.<eos> - What exactly do you want from me?<eos> - I need your advice.<eos> The guy's gonna be at the sonogram tomorrow, and I'm afraid i may cause a scene.<eos> - Louis, I don't understand what you're coming to me for.<eos> What do I know about-- - here, this is why.<eos> Yeah, you get it?<eos> This is why I'm coming to you.
- That's good work, and we can use that.<eos> But listen, I need you to do something for me.<eos> - You want Marissa to be first chair.<eos> - I think it's for the best.<eos> - Mike, I know why you think this is the right choice, but I can do this.<eos> - I'm sorry, Oliver, but at this point in your career,<eos> I don't think you can.<eos> you said it yourself-- you get flustered in court.<eos> - I know that, but if I'm going to be a real lawyer, I have to get better in trial, and the only way to do that is to get back on the horse.<eos> - And I'm telling you that when the right case comes along,
- I'm sorry, Oliver, but at this point in your career,<eos> I don't think you can.<eos> you said it yourself-- you get flustered in court.<eos> - I know that, but if I'm going to be a real lawyer, I have to get better in trial, and the only way to do that is to get back on the horse.<eos> - And I'm telling you that when the right case comes along,<eos> I promise i will let you do that, but this is not the case.<eos> This one's Marissa's, and I need to know you have her back.<eos> - I do.<eos> - I'll go tell her.<eos> - You don't have to do that, Oliver.
And I haven't had a life in five years, which is why I hired you, so don't you ever say that to me again.<eos> Look, Oliver's the kind of lawyer we get here.<eos> If he can't handle it, he can't handle it.<eos> That's how it goes.<eos> - Then I wanna petition the court to sit at the table with him.<eos> - No.<eos> - We can ask for a special exemption, and- and I said no, all right?<eos> They will not Grant it, and that is not your place here.<eos> - Then at least I can sit near him, and I can- you hear me right now!<eos> I gave you a chance, because I needed it, but if you risk the reputation of this clinic over one housing case, i will fire you and make sure that you are banned from ever sitting foot in a courtroom again.
- How could you possibly do that?<eos> to learn from your quips, i might be able to give it the ability to learn from your heart, but it would require your help.<eos> - You really think we could do that?<eos> - I don't know, but I know we can try.<eos> - Well, then the first thing that you need to learn is never, ever, ever sit in my chair.<eos> - Relax, Benjamin, I'm just messing with you.<eos> - Oh. - But get out of my chair.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Louis, what-- what are you doing here?<eos> - I need to bring you a few things.
- What is all that?<eos> - High school yearbooks, childhood photo albums, and six out of seven of the highlight reels my mother shot of us growing up.<eos> - What happened to the seventh?<eos> - Oh... Summer of dd.<eos> And if it's all the same to you, I would like to still be able to have sex again.<eos> Louis-- - you were right.<eos> We don't know everything about each other, but that just means we need to get to know each other better, and what better way to get to know each other then by preparing to bring our child into the world?<eos> - Louis, if this is your reaction to what we went through today, I feel like I know you better already.<eos> - Speaking of what we went through today, how'd it go?<eos> - Why don't you take me home, and I'll tell you all about it.
You really fu... up in there, Gunny.<eos> I know.<eos> - But I know I saw something.<eos> - Ah, yes.<eos> A man standing on the surface of Ganymede without a vac suit.<eos> Are you absolutely sure about that?<eos> So you think I'm crazy.<eos> I think we asked too much of you too soon.<eos> Bobbie, truth and fact are not the same thing.<eos> Now I know this may be too much for you to grab a hold of right now.

About the discovery of this incredible protomolecule on Phoebe.<eos> This was a way to guarantee the safety of Earth.<eos> At a terrible price.<eos> You're the one who taught me that Earth must come first.<eos> And Eros?<eos> A hundred thousand souls.<eos> Did I teach you that?<eos> If I had known what was going to happen on Eros, I would have stopped the project and Jules-Pierre Mao along with it and you know that!<eos> Eros nearly destroyed this planet.<eos> You will have to answer for your part in that.
Well, I've seen a few of you over the years, being how close we are to the UN.<eos> But that's not what tipped you.<eos> It's the way you're walking.<eos> Like the sky might fall in on you. Like the ground's gonna bite you.<eos> And if you're Martian, you'll have Osteo-X.<eos> Give me what you can spare and I'll tell you how to get to the ocean.<eos> You're a drug dealer.<eos> They're not gonna fly you to the moon.<eos> I know what Osteo-X is for.<eos> Then why do you want it?
Are you asking me to tell you that's okay?<eos> I know it's not.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Something I actually know how to do.<eos> Did you notice the Epipremnum patatas on the green wall?<eos> I'm sure that I did not.<eos> Right here.<eos> Big fork-shaped leaves on the vine.<eos> Same yellowing as before.<eos> If you say so.
It was being tested on Ganymede.<eos> Tested?<eos> By your own government.<eos> Fuck you, ma'am.<eos> Sergeant, I wish to God it was my government. Then I would have some control over the situation.<eos> But right now, all I have is you.<eos> So you're telling me that me and my team, we were... Sacrificial lambs.<eos> And your friend Travis...<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> And I don't believe a goddamn thing you were told to say in that room.
- to her hotel room. - Okay, Mike, Andy, it's time to call Harbor Grill and see what they remember and ask for a little cooperation.<eos> It's Tom's way or else.<eos> Mom will take his side on everything.<eos> You have problems with your stepfather?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He had an affair with my mom while she was still married to my dad.<eos> If you break up a marriage, maybe you have no business telling other people how to live their lives, you know?<eos> Well, maybe he didn't have any business being alive at all.<eos> What?<eos> You don't have to worry about Tom anymore.
You know what?<eos> I'd like to speak to a lawyer.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> ♪ Can't run, can't hide<eos> ♪ Big girls don't lie<eos> ♪ Small town kind of funny<eos> Mark?<eos> What the hell are you doing standing in front of my apartment building?<eos> Wait, are you waiting for me?<eos> Good morning to you, too, Honor Roll.
Rothman wants to rush to trial before you find the trigger man.<eos> - How fast are we talking?<eos> - I've heard three months.<eos> Bloom's got the money to push it through.<eos> And add the fact that your victim was employed on a top-secret project with the LAPD, and I see a little tsunami of reasonable doubt surging your way.<eos> We like our chances.<eos> Thanks for the heads up.<eos> I need to, um...<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's not how this works.<eos> I didn't drop by to give you an advantage so you can turn tail and run.
- ‭Yeah. Keyless entry. You guys are making a big deal out of this.<eos> All right, to open the door to their house, the killer had to have known the Chandlers' user name and password. Uh, password could be hackable, maybe.<eos> And had a phone familiar to their network. Because OffKey sends an alert anytime a new device is detected, and Mrs. Chandler didn't get one that night.<eos> So she says.<eos> And you guys are basing your entire case on this app thing.<eos> Not at all. We find Mr. Pay Phone, and it's game over.<eos> Well, lucky for me, I get paid either way, but you better find your missing hitman soon, 'cause the clock is ticking.<eos> And Bloom's not your usual moron.<eos> Well... it's great to see you again, Honor Roll.<eos> Keep up the good work. It suits you.
Amy. What happened to you on the stand was a mistake that could have happened to any one of us, and they will all learn from that.<eos> Thank you, Captain. I appreciate it.<eos> Hello?<eos> You know, in the video you guys sent us, Mr. Pay Phone slouched.<eos> Mark?<eos> Like he knew to hide from the bus.<eos> - Are you following me again?<eos> Unbelievable. I was here first, Honor Roll, so technically, you're following me.<eos> Unh, unh.<eos> - That's pretty creepy. - What the hell are you doing?

I already wrote my suicide note.<eos> "To whom it may concern Dear everybody, my death has nothing to do with that asshole Tucker."<eos> "I hereby leave Buckeroo to Suzy K., my only friend who cared enough to bring him carrots.<eos> The rest of my stuff should be kept exactly where it is, like a shrine so people can remember me.<eos> Under no circumstances are my brothers ever allowed in my room."<eos> "For Tucker, I'll leave a list of all the guys I've had really great sex with so he can be jealous for all eternity...<eos> Greg, Houston, Cody H., Cody D."<eos> Cody D.?<eos> Well it was just anal so I'll still get into Heaven.<eos> The part about you is at the end.

Eugene!<eos> Eugene!<eos> Eugene, where are you?<eos> I need you.<eos> I need you.<eos> Please, come now.<eos> Lock the door.<eos> He cheated on me.<eos> I'm gonna kill myself.<eos> I'm sorry, Tracy, but I'm not gonna help you with this.
- Well, neither do I.<eos> Stomach's still doing bloody flips after seeing that.<eos> Not that.<eos> I-I gotta go lie down.<eos> We're only just getting started.<eos> Yeah, and I don't feel good.<eos> - Give me a sec.<eos> - All right.<eos> What's going on, Tulip?<eos> I told you a bunch of times, okay?
Let's try that one.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I'm sorry, Padre.<eos> I'm gonna have to go with her.<eos> What?<eos> Well, she can't check into a motel.<eos> - We're staying with Denis.<eos> - Who?<eos> The guy who we're staying with, Denis, if he finds out we're staying at a motel, he'll never forgive me, all right?<eos> I'll text you the address.
Preacher lookin' for God.<eos> That's a joke.<eos> You seem anxious.<eos> I ain't anxious.<eos> All right. Well, nervous then.<eos> But it's okay.<eos> It makes sense.<eos> I'm nervous and I'm not the one who just killed a man with a pager wand.<eos> Where are you talking about that?<eos> - I told you not to talk about that.
But we would like to sleep in your house for a very long time.<eos> All right, come on quick.<eos> Are you sure he's okay with this?<eos> He left the door open, didn't he?<eos> I know where you can find God, Preacher.<eos> Man-dog in the basement.<eos> - No, I saw that already. - Hey.<eos> - It's not what I'm looking for.<eos> - Don't talk to her.<eos> Ah, Eddie, you're so embarrassing.

Yeah?<eos> Well, Jesse's not.<eos> As long as he thinks God's here, he's not going anywhere.<eos> I'm sure he might if he knew about your troubles.<eos> If he knew about my troubles, he'd make it a whole lot worse.<eos> - Believe me.<eos> - Why would he do that?<eos> He's your ex-fiancé, and he loves you.<eos> I can't tell him.<eos> Well, then, let me help you out.
- Believe me.<eos> - Why would he do that?<eos> He's your ex-fiancé, and he loves you.<eos> I can't tell him.<eos> Well, then, let me help you out.<eos> You can't help me, Cassidy.<eos> Really?<eos> You serious?<eos> Helped you move the body of your murder victim, didn't I?<eos> And I've helped you lie to my best mate more than once now.

I'm Lewis.<eos> Lara.<eos> Thanks for the drink.<eos> Thank you, honey.<eos> I don't make a habit of talking to ladies in bars.<eos> I got to tell you, you're about the hottest thing I've seen since fire.<eos> Well, thank you, Lewis.<eos> So you like America, huh?<eos> Who doesn't?<eos> Which part about it do you love most?
Those men back there... how'd you get them to stop?<eos> I told 'em to.<eos> You told them to?<eos> It's the collar.<eos> Gives me a-an authority.<eos> Who are they?<eos> What do they want?<eos> They are a super-secret crypto-religious fascist organization with designs on total world domination.<eos> Yeah, that's the same look I had when I heard it.<eos> Who told you that?
Some kind of cover-up.<eos> Some sort of group.<eos> I'm just trying to figure out why.<eos> Well, that's cool.<eos> What's up?<eos> Well, we're at this guy Denis' place.<eos> Cassidy keeps talking about how great he is, but I think he pretty much hates Cassidy's guts, so...<eos> But he got cereal and Pop-Tarts.<eos> Is that why you called me?<eos> I'm just filling you in.
Listen up!<eos> Number four on the list,<eos> Ismat Zahad, just dropped off the radar at Gwynn Oaks.<eos> Far as we're concerned,<eos> Zahad is on the loose and operational.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'd give you a hug, but...<eos> I'm good.<eos> You want something to drink?<eos> Bryan, first of all, I-I don't want you to think I don't know what you've been going through since Cali was killed.
Bryan, first of all, I-I don't want you to think I don't know what you've been going through since Cali was killed.<eos> Murdered, but okay.<eos> Murdered.<eos> Right.<eos> Even so, I gotta say, I'm a little... Confused.<eos> It's about that.<eos> Carlos Mejia.<eos> Actually, it's more about you, and why you even have the live feed to his cell.<eos> His cell at a government black site, by the way.<eos> I was wrong to show it to you.
Standby, over-watch.<eos> - Disarm the device.<eos> - When we have him.<eos> And I won't release him until the device is disarmed.<eos> It's back.<eos> The signal's back!<eos> No, no.<eos> They changed the timer.<eos> 40 seconds, 39...<eos> Means you gotta haul ass out of there now, bro.
The last Saturday of every month since April 2015, he's had a 9:00 tee time at Annandale Golf Cub.<eos> I thought he lived in Baltimore.<eos> When you're the guest of the Chief of Staff to the Secretary of Defense...<eos> Keagy?<eos> Bert Keagy?<eos> He's been calling the shots on all of this?<eos> Never trust a man in a bowtie.<eos> What if this doesn't end with Keagy?<eos> What if it goes further, higher up?<eos> He's not gonna tell you that.
Would you mind if I...<eos> - It's okay.<eos> I can get through it.<eos> Because this much I'm certain of.<eos> Cali wouldn't want you to do anything...<eos> - Dumb?<eos> - That would ruin your life.<eos> Right.<eos> It wasn't a false alarm, was it?<eos> I can't tell you what it was.
I mean, if you don't wanna tell me... it was just a check up.<eos> And?<eos> - You're gonna think I'm...<eos> - Yeah, you said that already.<eos> Would you be my emergency contact?<eos> That's it?<eos> That's it.<eos> I, um...<eos> I didn't know who else to ask.<eos> Whatever you need...
- It's also good for making focaccia.<eos> - Mm. I mean, it can toast any thickness.<eos> What about a mini pizza oven?<eos> It's a really unusual gift.<eos> Is she a party animal?<eos> Just a sec.<eos> Hello?<eos> Yes, Stally.<eos> Really?<eos> Hey, we thought you'd want to hear this.
- Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you're right. The confession's all bullshit.<eos> Can we chat in my office?<eos> - I wanted to see you.<eos> - What's there to say?<eos> He's a liar.<eos> There are other things.<eos> Is this your office?<eos> That's what we call it.<eos> Come on, fix you a drink.
Is this your office?<eos> That's what we call it.<eos> Come on, fix you a drink.<eos> What do you want, cocktail?<eos> Probably wondering what my deal is.<eos> I'm kind of between relationships at the moment.<eos> Doing it pretty tough, to be honest.<eos> Yep, I know what that's like.<eos> So what can I do for you?<eos> I mean, you could be asking yourself what could I do for you?

Er, how do you know him?<eos> He's her brother.<eos> I don't know him.<eos> She thought I was Liam at your place last night.<eos> Hey, I think we should... I think we should start with Sydney's IVF clinics.<eos> We could identify the parents with a record of multiple attempts at pregnancy, people who are desperate to try anything.<eos> Hey, Adrian, what is happening?<eos> What is going on?<eos> Why am I in an apartment opposite Hilmarson?<eos> She's reporting to you, is she?

I'm betting the baby's parents would have made multiple IVF attempts before they tried surrogacy.<eos> They'd be known to the clinic as desperate.<eos> - Do people ask you who the dad is?<eos> - Actually, no.<eos> And how did you and Adrian get together?<eos> - Get close?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, I knew he was married, so I didn't think about him like that.<eos> I just thought he was an excellent boss, a decent man, kind of straight.<eos> - Do you really want to know?
Is he in the loo?<eos> Actually, darling, he's gone.<eos> Why, what happened?<eos> Is he all right?<eos> Um, shall we order first?<eos> No.<eos> Did you fight?<eos> He's already married.<eos> Alexander is already married.<eos> He told us a terrible story about a rescue, and ruin, and he's going to do that to you, baby, and he is dangerous.
Badly burnt.<eos> Yes, I've been... burnt.<eos> Deep-fried.<eos> What if I was to put it to you a different way and say, you pick the number of nights?<eos> You know, just choose a number. Any number.<eos> Stally, I... I don't know that we're really suited.<eos> No. No, we're not.<eos> How's the case going, then?<eos> Bet it's been hard to move.<eos> - I sent you an e-mail.
Yeah. Some of them.<eos> My mum's, too.<eos> Oh, I love this.<eos> This is wonderful.<eos> I should go.<eos> Are you done?<eos> Alexander doesn't really check his phone.<eos> He's from the pre-digital age, when you make arrangements before you leave and you have conversations face-to-face.<eos> My parents are really freaked out about his age.<eos> Did they tell you about that?
Careful, honey.<eos> Here, love, here, darling.<eos> Thanks, love.<eos> You all right, mate?<eos> You got your dinosaurs?<eos> Darling, give him his dinosaurs.<eos> That's it.<eos> Hey.<eos> Good luck, today.<eos> You are a good boy, do you want your surprise now?
That's it.<eos> Hey.<eos> Good luck, today.<eos> You are a good boy, do you want your surprise now?<eos> Yes! - OK.<eos> Darling? - Yes, honey?<eos> Can you get the nuts out?<eos> - There you go.<eos> - There you go, one for you<eos> - and one for you. - Aren't you lucky.
You can do whatever you goddamn want.<eos> I don't belong here.<eos> I'm not ready to be a king.<eos> I wasn't done being me.<eos> It was so much simpler when there was just one giant evil dick trying to kill us.<eos> - Now we're just--<eos> - Grown-ups.<eos> How did this happen?<eos> I have an idea...<eos> to help you.
And, Eliot, I don't know how to politely ask you to fuck me.<eos> Oh, look, Margo's here.<eos> You remember Lasaro?<eos> That creep who made the Margolem?<eos> I twisted his arms and/or balls a little, and he gave up the spell.<eos> Living clay is hard to come by, but Fogg left his stash so unprotected, it's like he wanted me to steal it.<eos> So I did.<eos> We're gonna make another you.<eos> Hey.<eos> Made you a sandwich...
Uh...<eos> Better... nap, seeing you alive, magic methadone... methadone.<eos> Thanks... for all of it.<eos> So, um, how did you find me?<eos> After asking around a bit, I heard about a girl who was doing miracles for a quick fix.<eos> I called it "turning tricks."<eos> You think I'm judging you, I'm not.<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm judging myself.<eos> You... you saved my life, and... you know, I-I thought it would be okay to run... if I got the cavalry and I came back to help you, but I... I just ran.
Richard's alumni key.<eos> It gets you past the wards at Brakebills.<eos> I was expelled.<eos> Alarm bells will go off the second I pop in.<eos> I didn't go to school there.<eos> I mean, how am I supposed to find this book?<eos> "Best bitches"?<eos> It's the only one the bodega had.<eos> Okay, bitch, say something.<eos> - You seeing this?
No killing Todd.<eos> Fucking Todd.<eos> Is this a bad time?<eos> Come sit over here.<eos> I saw a-a... strange woman.<eos> She's... pale and had... horn things.<eos> You've seen the White Lady.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> "White Lady?"<eos> You are fortunate she offered herself to some Centaur's sight while you happened to be watching.

Second-year.<eos> Universidad De Asombro in Spain.<eos> I'm here for the Welters tournament.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> I would make a joke about ball handling, but I'm deadly serious about ball handling.<eos> - Me too. - Mm.<eos> Listen, Javier, I could keep this up all night... - So could I.<eos> - But I have to reclaim my title as the life of this and every party by making a drink so perfect--<eos> It seems like you need to relax.
Now cross your index and ring fingers.<eos> No, under the middle.<eos> Now slide the thumb along the meridian.<eos> Now draw the arrow back.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thank me by shutting up.<eos> There's a creature called the White Lady.<eos> I saw her yesterday.<eos> She's one of the seven Questing Creatures of Fillory.<eos> If you can catch her, she has to give you whatever you ask.
She's one of the seven Questing Creatures of Fillory.<eos> If you can catch her, she has to give you whatever you ask.<eos> Plover wrote about her, called her the Winter's Doe.<eos> She lives in the Darkling Wood.<eos> It's just past the Flying Forest.<eos> It's not far from here.<eos> We could hunt her together.<eos> "Let's go hunt the White Lady"?<eos> People like me get shot for saying shit like that.<eos> She can give you your hands back.

Right or left?<eos> Right seems to be the popular direction.<eos> Julia?<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> - Look, I can explain.<eos> - No.<eos> After you jumped in and screwed everything up with Penny,<eos> Alice died killing your little friend Martin.<eos> Then Quentin was almost ripped in half.<eos> And you have the balls to come here.
- What about them?<eos> - They're a dirty company.<eos> They've been getting away with shit for years.<eos> I could never go after them when I worked at Pearson Specter because we were always on the other side of these things, but I can go after them now.<eos> Mike, if this is going to require me going to court...<eos> It's not.<eos> Look, Oliver, I know what happened the other day.<eos> But you don't have to be a trial lawyer to be a great lawyer.<eos> - I'm saying that you have skills that other lawyers don't have and I'm gonna put those skills to use right now.<eos> - What do you need?
Mike, if this is going to require me going to court...<eos> It's not.<eos> Look, Oliver, I know what happened the other day.<eos> But you don't have to be a trial lawyer to be a great lawyer.<eos> - I'm saying that you have skills that other lawyers don't have and I'm gonna put those skills to use right now.<eos> - What do you need?<eos> - You see those boxes?<eos> That's every case that Velocity has settled in the last 20 years where the names of the plaintiffs have been sealed.<eos> We need to figure out who those people are, what they got paid not to say, and then we need to get every damn one of them to come forward.<eos> Mike, what did these guys do to you?
I already found six cases we can use, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.<eos> So let's grab our coats and go kick Velocity's ass up and down the street.<eos> Easy, Tyson.<eos> You have to tell me what kind of suits these are.<eos> They're mining suits, which means health problems or corporate negligence...<eos> Either way, the damages could be through the roof.<eos> Oliver, this is great.<eos> I know.<eos> And if you asked me to make an argument about it in court, I'd probably shit the bed.<eos> But, Mike, I'm telling you, there's something here.

Because like I said, I'm not gonna be shaken down by the likes of you.<eos> Harvey, I just got a phone call from the lawyers at Velocity,<eos> They wanted me to confirm that we're co-counsel with Mike on this.<eos> What'd you tell them?<eos> What do you think I told them?<eos> I told them yes.<eos> Because if they're asking, he obviously bluffed and I'm not gonna hang him out to dry.<eos> - I'm gonna find out what he did and why he did it.<eos> - What the hell did you do?<eos> - Relax, Harvey, I was just coming to tell you...
Where are we going?<eos> Pearson Specter agreed to partner up on the case.<eos> - Shit, that's big.<eos> - Want in?<eos> Hell yeah.<eos> Give me ten minutes.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> You wanna tell me what this is?<eos> That is an agreement to co-counsel and I was just gonna come tell you about it.
They're taking half their usual fee.<eos> That's all they're getting.<eos> And what about you, Mike?<eos> What are you getting?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You're gonna tell me you're not using this as a stepping stone to get back to your old firm?<eos> What?<eos> No, Nathan, I don't want to go back there.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> I don't believe you.
Ghandi.<eos> Harvey.<eos> - You serious?<eos> - Hand to God.<eos> Man's practically a saint.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Oliver, Harvey Specter.<eos> Harvey Specter, Oliver.<eos> Nice to meet you, Oliver.<eos> Would you like me to pour you a drink?
Because these associates are amazing lawyers, but not a single one of them mentioned an actual human being involved in this case the whole night.<eos> They're just trying to win.<eos> And there's nothing wrong with that, but that's not you.<eos> Yeah, Oliver, there is something wrong with that.<eos> And that's why you're gonna be a better lawyer than any one of these guys.<eos> I'm gonna go tell Harvey that we're in the home stretch.<eos> - How's it going, genius?<eos> - What?<eos> I said, how's it going?<eos> I'll tell you how it's going.
And it's supposed to learn from itself, but it isn't.<eos> Hey, what's going on?<eos> The story I always told myself was the only reason I didn't work in Silicon Valley was that I didn't want to, but the truth is, I don't have what it takes.<eos> And then you come in here, calling me a genius and...<eos> Benjamin, it's okay.<eos> You're only human.<eos> If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.<eos> Really?<eos> Really.<eos> Besides, if I can't show you compassion, how can I ever expect The Donna to show compassion?
No, you were the least experienced dickhead I ever met.<eos> - Right. - Because that kid may be green, but he's the only one of you two that actually went to law school.<eos> Don't I know it.<eos> Mike, what's on your mind?<eos> Nothing.<eos> This whole thing we're doing is making me lie to a lot of people, including Oliver and I'm not thrilled about it.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Nathan thinks there's an ulterior motive to this case and he's right.<eos> Oliver saw it and I had to lie to them both to cover it up.<eos> Maybe that's true, but you need to keep your eye on the ball.
Tried to lowball me, called me an idiot and then kicked me out.<eos> How high did he go?<eos> A hundred million.<eos> - What?<eos> And how exactly would you have done that when you told me not to counter?<eos> I'm more intimidating.<eos> I walk into a room, people cave.<eos> It's a gift.<eos> I think it's a gift when you leave the room.<eos> My gift to you was saving your ass when you screwed the pooch by involving me in this case.
I'm sure he's glad to have you back.<eos> I'm glad to be back.<eos> - What was it like working with my dad?<eos> You said it was a great pairing and I was just wondering...<eos> - What you were missing. - Yes.<eos> You were missing a brilliant, tireless, sweet, funny, charming man. Who may also be the best litigator I've ever seen.<eos> Maybe you didn't understand my question.<eos> I was asking what it was like to work with Zane, not Kaldor.<eos> Rachel, I'm serious.<eos> I learned a lot about your father while I was there and I'm telling you, it was all good.
Maybe you didn't understand my question.<eos> I was asking what it was like to work with Zane, not Kaldor.<eos> Rachel, I'm serious.<eos> I learned a lot about your father while I was there and I'm telling you, it was all good.<eos> What about his temper?<eos> Well, maybe it wasn't all good.<eos> Well, good night.<eos> One more thing I learned about him.<eos> He doesn't just love you, he respects you.<eos> - When he offered you that job, he was beaming.

Because you said Pearson Specter would never take on a case like this when you were there before.<eos> Yeah, because they never wanted to be on the wrong side of a corporate lawsuit.<eos> Then why are they on the wrong side of one now?<eos> - Oliver...<eos> - Please, don't lie to me, Mike.<eos> Just tell me what's going on.<eos> It's a long story, but we brought the suit so I that could get into the Bar.<eos> So you were lying to Nathan, only not about what he thought.<eos> - Listen to me...<eos> - I'm not gonna listen and you need to tell him what's going on.
It was so nice doing it with yours the other night I thought maybe tonight we could do it with mine.<eos> Louis, what's wrong?<eos> Nothing's wrong.<eos> I... had a bad day and I wanted to talk to you about it.<eos> But you went to all this trouble and I don't want to bring you down.<eos> Louis, my yearbooks are always gonna be here.<eos> And hearing about something as important to you as your work isn't going to bring me down.<eos> It's going to bring us closer.<eos> Are you sure because I have a lot of bad days at work.<eos> Which is all the more reason for you to have someone to make you feel better at home.

Yeah, that was before I had a chat with your buddy James Palmer.<eos> Look, I don't even know James Palmer, so whatever he said...<eos> He didn't have to say anything, all he had to do was point.<eos> So what?<eos> This is an off-shore account in my name.<eos> An off-shore account with $300,000 in it, deposited exactly a day after Velocity supposedly stole your technology.<eos> I was told by my accountant to shelter certain earnings.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> You don't have those kind of earnings.<eos> And you didn't have to keep this quiet because you're married.
And you didn't have to keep this quiet because you're married.<eos> You kept it quiet because you're in on it.<eos> I was in on it.<eos> I saw a chance to jump ship and get paid in the process.<eos> But instead, they pulled the job and put just enough money in that account to implicate me.<eos> - You piece of shit.<eos> - Please, my employees are gonna lose their jobs because of me.<eos> We need to keep this suit going and get that technology back.<eos> Nuh-buddy.<eos> You don't give a shit about your employees and I don't give a shit about you.
I'm just gonna get a little fresh air.<eos> I'm so full.<eos> Napa?<eos> Your boss is really spreading out.<eos> And he's pretty successful for a 28 year old.<eos> Well, he's just never around when I stop by, So I-i-i looked him up online.<eos> No, I'm not following him.<eos> Don't mind me.<eos> I'm not listening.<eos> Gus, let me, - let me call you back. Okay.
He's psychotic, andy... And we know he carries a grudge.<eos> I don't think I look my age.<eos> Maybe I should grow a goatee.<eos> Yeah, but how many years would that take?<eos> Probably two if I started right now.<eos> Um, wes and hobbs. Nailed another defendant in court the other day.<eos> You guys would've been really proud of them.<eos> What, do I look weird?<eos> My... My hair, it feels funny today.<eos> No, I'm just thinking you're almost 21. And how grown up you are.
A tree that you guys are supposed to...<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> I can't start until we get a hook and ladder.<eos> From the l.A. Fire department.<eos> Yeah, if they'll stop hanging up on me.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> I was actually on my way to meet with the lawyer. Yeah.<eos> Right.<eos> Did mark's grandparents agree to let you babysit him?
Guys?<eos> Air drops are common for drug traffickers.<eos> Hey, guys!<eos> I think I need a hand down.<eos> Sit tight, doctor!<eos> The fire trucks will be here... Any minute.<eos> Guys!<eos> Yeah, flynn.<eos> Yeah, look, I know you had plans. This weekend, but we caught a murder.<eos> So you may have to reschedule your...
Looking at the stars, taking pictures.<eos> We are going to have to go through every one of these posts. One by one to find a potential witness.<eos> Match found. Match found... Excuse me.<eos> I-I have to make a phone call.<eos> Doctor, would you like to go?<eos> And then we will report back to you... If we find a lead.<eos> No. My physician's eye could be crucial. In sorting through this mountain of information.<eos> Thank you, because somewhere in there is a witness.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I've been calling you.
That beacon's still sending a signal?<eos> Seems to be.<eos> Doesn't look like anyone's followed up on it.<eos> Well, so far.<eos> All right, we need to get all this weed downtown.<eos> But let's leave the beacon here for now.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Mike, why don't you keep things rolling here. While I, go call the captain? With your permission, doctor.<eos> Wes, why don't you stay here.
Why not?<eos> It's romantic.<eos> Yeah, well, it's crowded.<eos> You really wanna propose to mom in a room full of strangers?<eos> Yeah? Well, what do you suggest?<eos> Something private, intimate.<eos> Definitely not in the middle of a murder investigation.<eos> Well, I can't wait much longer, okay?<eos> This ring is burning a hole in my pocket.<eos> Okay, okay, all right. What... what if... What if I helped you?
Drug dogs.<eos> All of it, overtime.<eos> Right. I forgot.<eos> Cost doesn't matter to major crimes.<eos> You'll get everything you want in one order.<eos> Now I suppose you're aware that the rest of the department, We don't work like that.<eos> Adios, senora.<eos> If only.<eos> Andy, get a warrant.<eos> Buzz, you're gonna need your camera.
Good luck.<eos> Well, since we couldn't go out to dinner... The other night,<eos> I thought that I would bring dinner to you.<eos> It's from serve.<eos> Serve.<eos> Andy, where we had our first date.<eos> That is so thoughtful.<eos> Um... I've been doing a lot of thinking lately.<eos> About...<eos> About you.
Well, what do you mean Tariq is missing?<eos> What are we gonna do? We gonna close down?<eos> I saw the Bassetts walked out.<eos> No, we gotta keep the party going.<eos> Just do whatever it takes, all right?<eos> Look, I'll call Karen to smooth this over.<eos> Okay.<eos> Karen, it's Andre.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> He'll call you back.
You shouldn't be here!<eos> I shouldn't be here.<eos> I gotta find Tariq, but Raina said you know some of these people he'd been fucking with.<eos> Some motherfucker named Slim?<eos> Shit.<eos> Hey, wait, what do you mean, "find Tariq"?<eos> He's missing, Dre.<eos> They asked Tasha for money.<eos> Who is Slim?<eos> I told you to have a closer eye on the kid.
Who is Slim?<eos> I told you to have a closer eye on the kid.<eos> You told me it was family business.<eos> You told me to fall back.<eos> Do you know where he is or not?<eos> I could find out. Good.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> Where's Ghost?<eos> Wait, wait, wait, you don't know?<eos> I thought he would have called you.
Plus the money.<eos> Well, if it's money you want, I'm in a better position to give it to you than Ghost.<eos> I'm back working for Tommy moving weight.<eos> Um, uh, I can get you back in.<eos> Good.<eos> You gettin' back in the drug game ain't got shit to do with our paper.<eos> I hear that, but with the cops around Ghost, now how long before they start looking for his kid?<eos> All the questions they gonna be asking, too many ways this shit could play out.<eos> Me? I don't give a fuck.<eos> But you can't afford to get caught.

I don't give a fuck.<eos> But you can't afford to get caught.<eos> - Neither of you.
I'ma take you home now, all right?<eos> Wait, we gotta figure out what you gon' tell Tasha about tonight.<eos> No, I already know what to say.<eos> I got you.<eos> Come here, Tariq.<eos> Where was he?<eos> Where were you?<eos> Ma, I'm sorry.<eos> I-I was just hanging out with some friends.<eos> I fell asleep, and he thought it would be funny to send you that picture. It was just a big joke.
- Under his fingernails.<eos> - It's a lie.<eos> They're also saying they found your fingerprints at the apartment, the crime scene. Look, man, I was there, okay?<eos> I was inside the apartment, but I wore gloves.<eos> On the outside window.<eos> Fire escape.<eos> - Motherfucker.<eos> Look, Proctor, you told me I needed to get that recording, the button mic, off of Ruiz.<eos> You said that Tommy and I... You said we'd go down.<eos> Yeah, I didn't tell you to break into an FBI agent's apartment to get it.
James would never shoot a cop.<eos> How much of this has to do with Angela?<eos> She's a distraction, Tasha.<eos> We need to stay on task.<eos> Please, get the money together.<eos> Yo, it's all over the news.<eos> The fuck happened, Tommy?<eos> They're saying nightclub owner James St. Patrick killed an FBI agent.<eos> Yeah, well, it ain't your problem.<eos> You're still safe from Milan, so you can go home.
So what if the cops come for you next, Tommy?<eos> And then Tasha.<eos> And then me.<eos> Guess what? I don't feel safe.<eos> Ghost ain't got nothin' to do with mine and Tasha's business.<eos> Yeah, but I do, 'cause you all got me twisted up in this bullshit.<eos> So what happens if the cops come for me, Tommy?<eos> We can prep you to answer their questions if that happens.<eos> But it ain't gonna happen.<eos> But if the Feds do come sniffing' around, you goin' missin' don't look too good.
And that's different for you how?<eos> Angela Valdes, this is John Mak from Eastern District. - Nice to meet you. - Valdes works upstairs.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure Proctor here is trying to weasel a deal out of you for one of his many guilty clients, huh?<eos> He's representing James St. Patrick in the Greg Knox murder trial. Mm, of course he is.<eos> And he's not guilty.<eos> Oh, of course he is.<eos> He hired you.<eos> Nice to meet you, Valdes.<eos> Proctor, I'll see you in hell.<eos> Yeah, saving you a seat on the bus, John.
When we decided to be partners, I told you we have people to answer to in Chicago and Belgrade.<eos> How do I explain giving the money back, especially to help Ghost, who is not part of our business?<eos> Helping Ghost helps everyone.<eos> Ghost fires Dean and asked for his money back.<eos> That explains Dean's disappearance.<eos> If the Feds start asking about Milan, we got a ready-made bedtime story for them.<eos> I mean, you're an accomplice in Milan's murder, Petar.<eos> So are the people in Chicago, since they signed off before we pulled the trigger.<eos> You help Ghost, you're protecting everybody.<eos> I will get you the money.
You help Ghost, you're protecting everybody.<eos> I will get you the money.<eos> And you're sure this is clean?<eos> Petar wired it from the security company, so on paper, it looks like reimbursement.<eos> Yo, so, Julio has this girl that he wants me to hire as a waitress.<eos> She was turning tricks for Dylan up in his spot before Ghost clipped him. - Yeah.<eos> - I gotta hire her?<eos> Yeah, he's distro now. Do what he says.<eos> Yo, why him over me?<eos> I held you down with taking care of Ruiz and knocking off Milan.
Look, man, he went missing. I'm sure Tasha's suspicious.<eos> She might be watching him.<eos> Where he goes, who he spends time with.<eos> Yo, if she catches him with you, this whole thing is over.<eos> Ghost and Tommy gon' try to kill us both, man. Ghost inside.<eos> He ain't killing' shit.<eos> And Tommy?<eos> He ain't gon' come looking for me.<eos> He is if you keep fuckin' with Tariq.<eos> Look, man. I'm giving you as much money as I can.
Come in, Padre.<eos> How you doing?<eos> You alright?<eos> Yeah.<eos> This your friend's place?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Denis.<eos> Wait 'til you meet him.<eos> He's hysterical.<eos> You're gonna love him. Yeah.
I just don't want to get in trouble.<eos> Hey, idiot!<eos> You're in Hell!<eos> You're already in trouble!<eos> Hey!<eos> Leave her alone.<eos> Hol-eee shit!<eos> Oh my frickin' Jeeezus, check out New Guy!<eos> Oh my god, dude!<eos> Alright, dude, I gotta ask you a question and you gotta be honest:
Yes, of course.<eos> My fault.<eos> - Guten tag.<eos> - Guten tag.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You were saying you were...<eos> You were helping your mother...?<eos> Adolf!<eos> See that man, with the hat?<eos> That's Herman Hoehne, the gallery owner I told you about.
While you still can.<eos> What is your name by the way?<eos> Eugene Root.<eos> Welcome to hell, Eugene.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Here.<eos> No more crying? Okay?<eos> 'Cause crying isn't gonna fix this.<eos> I brought you in.<eos> I trusted you, made you a part of my family.
I'm sorry.<eos> Here.<eos> No more crying? Okay?<eos> 'Cause crying isn't gonna fix this.<eos> I brought you in.<eos> I trusted you, made you a part of my family.<eos> And in return you made a fool out of me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know what else to say...<eos> Well, you better think of something 'cause "sorry" isn't gonna fix this either.
Right.<eos> Gonna grab something to eat and then we'll go.<eos> Wh-What?<eos> Wait... Where we going?<eos> Jazz clubs.<eos> We still got 137 more to see.<eos> Yeah, but what...<eos> What about Tulip?<eos> What about her?<eos> Are you... are you not wondering where she is?
How could that happen?<eos> Who let him out?<eos> Well someone better find him or we'll have to answer to you know who.<eos> Jesus.<eos> You're new, so here's a little background.<eos> When this place was initially conceived and constructed, no one had any idea the kind of numbers we'd be getting.<eos> Obviously we have issues of overcrowding, we're underfunded, and sometimes the machine breaks down.<eos> We'll have you back to your hell soon enough.<eos> Until then, I'm gonna put you in holding with the others.<eos> And this is what you need to consider...
Jess.<eos> Jess!<eos> What?<eos> What is it?<eos> I-I think Tulip's in trouble. I-I don't know.<eos> What?<eos> Bollocks.<eos> I wasn't supposed to say, alright?<eos> - Supposed to say what?<eos> - I've been hinting all day long, and you just... you haven't been listening.
What?<eos> Bollocks.<eos> I wasn't supposed to say, alright?<eos> - Supposed to say what?<eos> - I've been hinting all day long, and you just... you haven't been listening.<eos> You haven't been picking up on it.<eos> Okay, well, I'm picking up on it now.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Sh-Sh-She told me...<eos> She told me she could handle it and under no circumstances am I to tell you, so I...

You hired the Saint.<eos> I could make you unhire him.<eos> Use it.<eos> Watch what happens.<eos> That's how he's finding us.<eos> He's tracking the Word.<eos> Why did it have to be New Orleans?<eos> I knew someone would see me here.<eos> We got her.<eos> She told me she could handle it and under no circumstances am I to tell you, so...
What did you do?<eos> Wait, where are you going?<eos> Jesse.<eos> Jesse.<eos> Jesse Custer, you cannot do that to him.<eos> Jesse.<eos> Viktor!<eos> Alright, I get it.<eos> You're mad.<eos> I should've told you I was married.
People change.<eos> What?<eos> No, they don't.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Forgive me if I don't stay for dessert.<eos> I'm angry enough as it is.<eos> Uh, Dany, um any news on Carlos?<eos> If I hear anything, I'll let you know.<eos> Meantime, you say you're moving on, so move on.<eos> You've got houses to sell.
Bro, this is really uncomfortable.<eos> It's alright.<eos> We're just talking.<eos> When were you gonna stop lying to me?<eos> I'm sorry...<eos> You see, I thought we were in this together.<eos> I wanted to be.<eos> I tried to be.<eos> But this life you want...<eos> Doesn't it feel wrong to you?
And I don't know why it feels wrong to you.<eos> Because I'm an O'Hare, Jesse.<eos> I don't know how to do it.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> Or maybe you don't deserve it.<eos> Bro.<eos> But a Custer does, right?<eos> Is that what you're trying to do here?<eos> Be a Custer again?<eos> Like having a crap job and a crap life gives you the forgiveness you need for what you done?
But she doesn't love him and she never did because she loves you, you stupid idjit.<eos> If there's one thing I know, trust me, it's that.<eos> Can I ask you a question, Cassidy?<eos> Of course you can.<eos> That's what why I come.<eos> To dispense my considerable wisdoms.<eos> After lying to me?<eos> All this time?<eos> Probably since Texas, probably since she came back downstairs at the casino.<eos> After all that lying, why in the world would I ever trust you?

I don't. I don't.<eos> Lie to my face?<eos> Sneak behind my back?<eos> Now you're here to be a hero?<eos> To be a friend and talk me out of doing this?<eos> Look, not to make excuses here, man, but you know what?<eos> This whole thing, it's put me between a rock and hard place, alright?<eos> You didn't answer my question.<eos> Well, then maybe you should remind me. Huh?<eos> I asked you, why should I trust you?
Maybe that's the difference, though, between me and you.<eos> 'Cause you see, me, if I was in your situation?<eos> If some moppet had their hands on my girl?<eos> And I'm not ashamed to admit it.<eos> I don't think I'd be very restrained at all.<eos> No.<eos> I think I'd want to hurt them really, really bad.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've not come here to talk you out of anything, alright?<eos> I'm only here to let you kno that whatever you decide, I'm with you, Padre.
Pay up, sucker!<eos> Yeah, th's right.<eos> There, Oriental Avenue.<eos> Pat wants a word if you're free.<eos> Alright.<eos> What you're saying makes no sense.<eos> - You realize that, right?<eos> - It makes total sense.<eos> Pay me my rent or give me Atlantic Avenue.<eos> I gave you Ventnor and I gave you Marvin Gardens.
Alright, lady.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Do not pass Go.<eos> Do not collect $200.<eos> Tulip?<eos> Oh. I thought you were that crazy Preacher.<eos> What's up, kiddo?<eos> Couldn't sleep.<eos> Well, how about a little target practice in the basement, huh?<eos> You always like to do that.
Sergeant Cole?<eos> He's the officer that saved me that night.<eos> Okay.<eos> And are you two still in touch?<eos> Yeah, we sort of became friends.<eos> I knew his daughter, we went to college together.<eos> He's retired now, anyway.<eos> I asked him to make sure that Ray wasn't still obsessed with me.<eos> I should've called NYPD...<eos> The only thing that you need to worry about is you.
So the cigarette had to be dropped there the night of the assault.<eos> Which means it was planted.<eos> Which means that somebody was following Ray Wilson, waiting for him to drop a cigarette.<eos> So let's go back, talk to Wilson, and see if maybe he remembers somebody following him, watching him.<eos> So the stalker was being stalked.<eos> - Is that ironic or just weird?<eos> - Both.<eos> Now what?<eos> Pinning me with the Kennedy assassination?<eos> No, we actually believe you.
This is Officer Rixton.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Kimmy and Devon, right?<eos> Hi.<eos> Devon, you think you might want a snack?<eos> Whatever you want, on me.<eos> You know where the machines are?<eos> Um...<eos> So, Kimmy, I feel terrible about what happened to your sister, but I'm not gonna lie to you.
Until a week ago, I thought my dad was in prison.<eos> They lived under the same roof.<eos> Well, you can hide a lot if you try.<eos> Just ask Bunny.<eos> Ricky, we think that the reason that your DNA was a false positive is 'cause you're such a close match to your dad.<eos> Do you understand what I'm getting at here?<eos> No.<eos> My dad?<eos> Come on, Ricky.<eos> I am telling you... we are telling you that your father killed 13 girls.
I'll have the lobster.<eos> You were getting older, and Jimmy was married.<eos> And we just couldn't keep up the "Jimmy as family friend" thing, you know?<eos> So...<eos> So I heard there was a mix-up at your mother's storage facility and they auctioned everything off.<eos> I gave them a forwarding address.<eos> It's not my fault.<eos> Okay, well, I guess all your childhood pictures were there, and those are all gone now.<eos> But I... I saved all the ones your mom sent me over the years.<eos> I thought you might like this.
That's what matters to you right now? No.<eos> I don't believe this.<eos> All this time, I thought he was.<eos> What game are you running?<eos> Do you think that I'm gonna send Jimmy pictures of you for 15 years to run a con?<eos> I thought he was your dad.<eos> Do you want to tell him or should I?<eos> Well, Erin. He...<eos> He really cares about you.<eos> Maybe... Maybe you don't have to tell him.
So, when I ask one of you a question, as a courtesy to me, you can answer for the other.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um... Jimmy's not her dad.<eos> And I'm the bad guy.<eos> What am I signing up for?<eos> In terms of her mom?<eos> I imagine you got a pretty good idea.<eos> Patrol just picked up one of Emily's friends.<eos> He says that she got into an argument... A screaming match with Sandford Greg three days ago.<eos> Which differs from what she told you.
So, I guess, I just left that out.<eos> You want to get something off your chest?<eos> I mean, I can tell.<eos> You guys zeroed in on me the moment I walked in here.<eos> You haven't believed a word I said.<eos> That... That lady cop.<eos> She was just setting a trap.<eos> No.<eos> And now here you are, springing it.<eos> Hey, hey, hey. We were just trying to help you.
Walks like a duck.<eos> Mind if we take a look?<eos> Have at it.<eos> What's with all these spots around his eyes?<eos> Petechiae and tracheal bruising.<eos> Like your other guy.<eos> So, he was strangled?<eos> Odds are.<eos> Anything in your pocket gonna stick me? Get the hell off me.<eos> What'd I tell you about smoking dope back here, Oscar?
So, we got terminated even though we were following orders.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I've worked with people like that.<eos> This guy, Sandford...<eos> He'd show up, harass people.<eos> Young girls.<eos> He had been warned verbally and in writing to keep away.<eos> When Moony responded...<eos> What if I was the one who moved the body?<eos> You'd have to testify to that.
This guy, Sandford...<eos> He'd show up, harass people.<eos> Young girls.<eos> He had been warned verbally and in writing to keep away.<eos> When Moony responded...<eos> What if I was the one who moved the body?<eos> You'd have to testify to that.<eos> Only if it knocks Moony's sentence down.<eos> I'll push for involuntary manslaughter instead of murder, but...<eos> You're going to be charged with concealing a homicide.
Outpatient, sober living.<eos> Just whatever you need.<eos> And I would be there.<eos> Every step of the way, you have my word.<eos> Food for thought.<eos> I'll call you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> She didn't want to hear it.<eos> Well...<eos> Don't let that stop you from saying it, though.
Man, I seen them shorties around, but they ain't with us.<eos> Look, man, I'm telling you straight.<eos> All right.<eos> Do me a favor.<eos> You hear anything about who killed that girl, anything, I want to know.<eos> I'll keep my ears open.<eos> All right.<eos> Gonna be a lot of eyeballs on this thing.<eos> If I were you, I'd close this store, I'd pull your guys, lay low till this thing blows over.<eos> Hey, man, I owe you one, Rix.
You know what I think?<eos> I think you've had these urges for a long, long time.<eos> And you've resisted them.<eos> But when this thing with your roommate went down, something shifted for you. Hmm?<eos> I told you, it was those two black kids.<eos> Okay.<eos> I've been a cop, well, a lot of years.<eos> There's one thing I hate. I mean, I hate it when people blame the black kid.<eos> I get it all the time.<eos> I'll tell you something.
They were about two police reports away from getting shut down, losing all that funding, so they came up with a solution: Stop calling the police.<eos> Brady didn't suddenly clean up.<eos> They just got a little better at being dirty.<eos> You want my permission to break down their door?<eos> No, I want the exact opposite.<eos> You're Garry Mintoff's nephew?<eos> Look, I couldn't give a rat's ass whose kid I'm forced to hire.<eos> I don't really even care that you got jack experience.<eos> I just care that you can do the job, and here, that basically means one thing: You can handle on your own.<eos> You tell me you can do that, more than happy to give you a shot.
I'm Ryan.<eos> You're new.<eos> Yeah, well, it's my first day.<eos> So I'm guessing you don't know how things work around here.<eos> Um, no, I'm kind of learning as I go.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Showing you how things...<eos> - Okay, stop, stop that.<eos> - Actually work around here.<eos> Girls here can make you feel good.
I was hoping to look into their records.<eos> The girl's gonna be buried in a Potter's field unless someone out there is willing to claim her.<eos> I thought it was worth a look.<eos> Don't beat yourself up.<eos> If you could just keep me in the loop, please.<eos> Sure.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Get your level up.<eos> This week's chore list and community opportunities will be posted on...<eos> Ellie, you gotta go up top for meds.

It's not 4:00.<eos> They told me you gotta go.
Come on.<eos> Tonight in the cafeteria, we will be having a special problem-solving workshop.<eos> All those currently at level silver or below are required to attend.<eos> Okay, so, um, tell me how all this works.<eos> I'll do whatever you want long as you get me what I need.<eos> And what's that?<eos> Train ticket out of Chicago.<eos> To where?<eos> Los Angeles.<eos> You can't leave Brady.
And what's that?<eos> Train ticket out of Chicago.<eos> To where?<eos> Los Angeles.<eos> You can't leave Brady.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> - How are you gonna do that?<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> Well, am I a part of that "doesn't matter"?<eos> - Because I'm not gonna break you out.
Sam goes missing, and then her friend Ellie starts asking questions.<eos> We'll run with that.<eos> There's nothing else you can get out of this girl?<eos> You serious?<eos> Kid, you know, you're the one who gets the call done.<eos> We go off your gut.<eos> She's kissing my cheek, and she's pulling at my belt.<eos> Then call it.<eos> We don't have enough?<eos> Vince's admission to you is not a confession of guilt.
What do you want for this?<eos> I told you, I just want to talk.<eos> About what?<eos> Sam.<eos> Ellie, wait, Ellie.<eos> Do you want a train ticket? It's yours, all right?<eos> You wanna get out of here?<eos> Done.<eos> I'll lie for you, I'll sneak you out, hell, I'll even drive you.<eos> But if you want more, if you want to make sure that whatever's happening here stops, then I can help you with that too.
Ellie, I'm a cop.<eos> I will help.<eos> What?<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> I'm here to find out about Sam.<eos> Prove it.<eos> I want to see the badge.<eos> I don't have my badge on me.<eos> You're lying to me.<eos> What... what do you want from me?
It's your phone, and you used it to run Ellie and Sam.<eos> We recovered all of your deleted text messages.<eos> This one from Vince Dalton might be my favorite.<eos> "Your bitch Sam is threatening to spill.<eos> Says she and Ellie are gonna stop with me and all of it."<eos> Your reply? "I'll take care of it."<eos> You don't have to say anything.<eos> We have enough.<eos> I know that you had Vince signing you in and out in exchange for sex and cash.<eos> And I guarantee you, when he's charged with statutory rape, his loyalty to you is gonna disappear real quick.

Do what you gotta do.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - He's in here.<eos> You take a walk.<eos> Get up.<eos> Dude, what the hell is going on...<eos> That's it?<eos> Yeah, Tonya's getting charged and DCFS is gonna shut Brady down.<eos> Everybody there's gonna get an alternate placement.<eos> We found a really good family for you in Libertyville, the Melnicks.
Because she was fierce and vicious.<eos> My mother's ambition, her disregard for Lexa's alliance got her killed.<eos> If I may, why do you insist on ruling as Lexa did when it's not what's best for our people?<eos> At least tell me there's a reason.<eos> Forgive the intrusion, Your Highness.<eos> May we have a word... privately?<eos> You can wait like the other ambassadors.<eos> Echo, leave us... please.<eos> We were right to be concerned about Trishanakru.<eos> Rafel is gonna challenge you for control.
His leg's still healing.<eos> I'm in, too.<eos> Good.<eos> We roll in an hour.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Actually, yeah, I do.<eos> Since Octavia murdered Pike, I'm the only one left who knows where it is.<eos> Why are you defending him?<eos> Pike was a dictator.<eos> He was an elected chancellor, and if you don't care about that, he kept me alive for 3 months.
You ok?<eos> There is so much to do, and I get a total of 5 volunteers to help me fix the ship?<eos> That's a start.<eos> I can't run this repair alone, Clarke, even if I had complete mobility,<eos> even if Sinclair was still alive.<eos> Who... who the hell am I giving them orders?<eos> I'm... I'm not the Chief.<eos> I'm not the Chancellor, but here we are.<eos> For what it's worth, there's nobody I trust more to do this than you.<eos> As soon as Bellamy gets back with that machine, we go public with everything and get you the help that you need.

You're healing, but you need more time.<eos> I don't have time.<eos> I would be honored to take your place in this fight.<eos> I will not run from this challenge.<eos> Echo's right.<eos> I didn't save your life so that you could tear yourself apart again.<eos> Since when are you two on the same side?<eos> And if you can't help me, why the hell are you still here?<eos> This fight can still be avoided.<eos> Protecting Skaikru gives the other clans an excuse to challenge you.
Protecting Skaikru gives the other clans an excuse to challenge you.<eos> Let me take care of the problem.<eos> Let me do what your mother would have done.<eos> Then please just tell me, what did Wanheda offer?<eos> What deal is worth losing the faith of your people?<eos> Chance to survive the end of the world.<eos> That's what they're offering to all of us.<eos> Soon, Praimfaya will once again destroy everything.<eos> Skaikru's trying to stop it.<eos> My King, they're lying to you.
We make the best decisions that we can with the information that we have, then hope that there's a forgiving God.<eos> Can Roan fight?<eos> It's too soon.<eos> One simple task, and I'm failing.<eos> No. You'll figure it out.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> There's nothing more that I can do for Roan.<eos> You need to go back to Arkadia, to Clarke.<eos> Your necklace.<eos> What the hell do you want?
Every single one of us will survive on this ship.<eos> It won't be easy.<eos> Raven needs volunteers if we're gonna get it ready in time.<eos> It'll be a lot of work, but now you understand why we need to do it.<eos> If we stick together,<eos> I give you my word, we won't just survive.<eos> We'll thrive. Nice speech.<eos> Sometimes hope is more important than truth.<eos> Your dad would be so proud.<eos> You wanted workers.
'Versailles grows in stature day by day.<eos> 'Exterior works are complete. 'The palace is bursting at the seams with new rules, called etiquette.<eos> 'Noble tenants increase in number.'<eos> 'And the King's bed? ' 'The King is remaining remarkably faithful to his first mistress,<eos> And the brother?<eos> 'Prince Philippe enjoys an animated social life away from Versailles 'at his family home in Saint-Cloud 'while his lover, the Chevalier de Lorraine, remains in exile.'<eos> This new spy - tell me more.<eos> Young, very willing, very able.<eos> Let us hope so.<eos> Why do you need a historian?
And what do you do when your enemy's fortunes rise?<eos> When their fields blossom?<eos> Poison their well.<eos> You take all that is nourishing them and you pollute and defile it with venom.<eos> William knows what he's doing.<eos> He has tried to take my son. Instead, he has taken my love, my peace, my sleep.<eos> Now he takes my minister.<eos> But soon I will take his life, and that will be the end of it!<eos> Did he pay you? When you fought for me in the Spanish Netherlands, the Dutch came to you.<eos> They made an approach and they gave you money.
At once, Sire.<eos> Two tasters?<eos> What concern is that of yours?<eos> I would have thought at least three - one for the hall, one for the kitchen, one for the table.<eos> Who will be next, do you think?<eos> - Well, now that poor, sweet Henriette's gone, there is, as it were, a vacancy.<eos> Don't tell me Philippe will not be married again!<eos> It's clear that he must, but to whom?<eos> I have not yet decided.<eos> Well, I can't wait to help you.
Who would that be, precisely?<eos> You're changing and it scares me.<eos> You may be the Sun King, but, of late, when I look into your eyes, all I see is shadow.<eos> Are you thinking what I'm thinking?<eos> No.<eos> Of course you are, and I completely agree with you.<eos> It's self-evident.<eos> We need more wine.<eos> Now I'm home.<eos> I missed you.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?<eos> No.<eos> Of course you are, and I completely agree with you.<eos> It's self-evident.<eos> We need more wine.<eos> Now I'm home.<eos> I missed you.<eos> And I... mourned... your... absence... every... day.<eos> And while I will admit there were others... who vied for my affection... I can assure you, I was utterly faithful and true.<eos> Those Italians are persistent, though, I grant you.
Good.<eos> So, it is settled.<eos> We shall stay here.<eos> It's perfectly lovely.<eos> Just you and I.<eos> We shall throw a party for all our friends.<eos> All our friends are over there. At the "centre of the world"!<eos> Trust me, the world is really nothing special.<eos> What I saw of it from prison, anyway...<eos> You're lucky you kept your head on your shoulders.
He will marry you again, won't he?<eos> He can hardly compel you to...<eos> He will find a way.<eos> All right!<eos> We should have the biggest party in the world to welcome me back to civilisation.<eos> Invite most of our best friends, and all of our worst ones, too, we want it to be Fun after all!<eos> They won't come.<eos> You know, I feared this would happen.<eos> In my absence, you've become pathetic.<eos> Does it really take me to tell you this?
Does your brother control you so strongly that you cannot see it for yourself?<eos> The King has filled that palace with every single one of YOUR admirers.<eos> Louis might be their king, but the man they truly worship?<eos> Why, that would be you.<eos> He might be... the sun, my dear, but you are the star and it is time you showed your brother how brightly you can sparkle.<eos> I don't know if you've ever noticed, but while the sun rules the day, it is the stars that rule the night.<eos> I did miss you a great deal.<eos> I know.<eos> Tell me again.<eos> You must sit.
Perhaps you can give him a lesson.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> Are you completely without quality?<eos> Go on like this, there's no future in politics.<eos> Make an enemy of the most powerful woman in France and I doubt you'll have any future at all.<eos> You see him over there? Beauregarde?<eos> He fell foul of her and he's been sliding down the ranks ever since.<eos> Three weeks ago he was holding the King's shoe and now look at him.<eos> Removed from the cuffs.<eos> You do what I tell you to do, say what I tell you to say, and we will triumph!
I do not care for it.<eos> It clashes. Any additions should be approved by me and me alone.<eos> Perhaps you should notjudge it so harshly, my king.<eos> Perhaps time... I advise you to get rid of it.<eos> It is valued very highly in Rome.<eos> What on earth are you wearing?<eos> What amli wearing?<eos> It's a little dull...<eos> This is not.<eos> Do you like it?
An accent, something fun. If enough people join in, other people will feel left out if they do not belong.<eos> We could rule by colour.<eos> This winter will be blue!<eos> Not blue.<eos> Why not? It's the King's colour.<eos> Red, then.<eos> A rich crimson.<eos> Fashion will be our standard, darling, and the people will walk behind you.<eos> And me.<eos> I understand why you would want your friend to attend you, but why here?
I was beginning to think you would never return.<eos> You were correct.<eos> What changed your mind?<eos> I was spoken to. From on high.<eos> So... You are here out of duty.<eos> A blind obedience to a higher power, just like everyone else.<eos> They're here because... you want them to be.<eos> There is no other reason.<eos> What you want, you get.<eos> You must have realised that by now.
It is customary to bow to the King.<eos> One day, it will end, right?<eos> You have many reasons to renounce our affair.<eos> The scandal, the Queen, the Church...<eos> You're leaving.<eos> I have duties to attend to, as do you, I assume.<eos> My duty is to attend to His Majesty.<eos> What per news of our daughter?<eos> I am told she is in fine health.<eos> You are told?
Yes Sire.<eos> You collected it from the kitchens and you took it directly to her cell?<eos> Yes, Sire.<eos> Why are you so nervous?<eos> I'm not, Sire.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> I'm scared, Sire.<eos> Of what?<eos> Of you.<eos> You should be.
I believe we have our killer, don't you?<eos> Did you search the rooms of Gaston de Foix?<eos> Yes Sire. we found nothing.<eos> then search them again!<eos> Where did you meet him?<eos> In the corridor outside the kitchens or upstairs, in his room?<eos> Was it a powder or a liquid he poured onto the food?<eos> It was not him. You really suppose you were the only chambermaid to hoist her skirt up for him?<eos> He promised!<eos> To marry you?
I shut my eyes and think of you when you were a child, my love.<eos> He's a cruel man.<eos> Your father died fighting in his service.<eos> And now he's made of me a criminal and you an outcast.<eos> I shall return home.<eos> No, you must not!<eos> What can I do?<eos> You must find her!<eos> Who?<eos> It will help you.
You promised.<eos> I promised nothing, Sire.<eos> that I could do nothing.<eos> She's not meant to die.<eos> You no longer work in the service of the King.<eos> I shall ensure you receive a royal stipend.<eos> His Majesty is generous.<eos> You did the right thing, Sire.<eos> Did I?<eos> How do you know?
I shall ensure you receive a royal stipend.<eos> His Majesty is generous.<eos> You did the right thing, Sire.<eos> Did I?<eos> How do you know?<eos> Did our daughter die through the fault of the doctor?<eos> Through it's own weakness?<eos> Or was it simply God's will?<eos> What does it matter, Sire?<eos> I'll soon make you another.
How can those hands, that have killed so many times, be so gentle?<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Yes.<eos> You really are divine.<eos> Give me your hand.<eos> I could eat you up.<eos> Do you like games?<eos> What sort of games?<eos> I don't think I like this sort of game.<eos> Oh, you're not supposed to like it.
Wail all you like, it excites me!<eos> Oh, you poor thing!<eos> Do you know what day it is today?<eos> This is the anniversary of the day that you took over as King.<eos> Do you remember what you said to me that night?<eos> Remind me.<eos> You said: "The secret is not to be king, it is to be seen to be king."<eos> And that, my dear brother, is what you have forgotten.<eos> You have taken off your clothes and shown us your frailty.<eos> I suggest you put them back on.
Are you sending that to her?<eos> Eric, why would you do that?<eos> I don't know, sometimes I surprise myself.<eos> All right.<eos> Time to go.<eos> One moment of peace you have with her.<eos> She said, "I was never in peace. I hated".<eos> She said, "I was driven by hate".<eos> Gran?<eos> Not towards you but towards other people.
Go.<eos> So am I with you today?<eos> One last thing.<eos> Tips are coming in from the public by the truckload.<eos> Anything comes your way, pass it along to Detective Delorme.<eos> I want a written tip sheet on every one.<eos> Yes sir.<eos> Does he know?<eos> Yesterday he was your biggest fan, today he's burying you in sups.<eos> Is that so you don't have enough time to follow your own investigation?

I get a little... chippy when I drink.<eos> No hard feelings?<eos> Where am I?<eos> You're at Edie's house.<eos> You remember Edie, with the face?<eos> You must have had a few too many because you got pretty sick.<eos> They were gonna bounce you to the curb, so we brought you here.<eos> What time is it?<eos> It's, um, eczema by the way.<eos> You were too polite to ask, but I'm pretty sure that you were wondering.
I should probably make a call.<eos> Do you know where my phone is?<eos> No sorry, I didn't find a phone, but you can use the one upstairs if you want.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're probably pretty dehydrated.<eos> You puked up a lot of fluids.<eos> Here.<eos> Take your time.<eos> There you go.<eos> I'd bring you the phone but it's mounted to the wall.
You puked up a lot of fluids.<eos> Here.<eos> Take your time.<eos> There you go.<eos> I'd bring you the phone but it's mounted to the wall.<eos> It's old school.<eos> Is it,<eos> Claire you wanted to speak to?<eos> Girlfriend?<eos> Did I tell you about her?

Promise.<eos> Thanks a lot for punching me in.<eos> You didn't ask.<eos> I asked last week.<eos> Consider it a standing request, Edie.<eos> I'll do the same for you.<eos> I'm never late.<eos> Well, that is part of a larger conversation.<eos> Do you have any gum?<eos> You work a s**t job, All you ever do is, do what you're told.
- He did it.<eos> - No, he was cleared.<eos> - He did it.<eos> You can't just re-open it.<eos> Not without cause.<eos> Then find me some.<eos> That's why there is no paper on this.<eos> It's not even supposed to be happening.<eos> Well I was told you had good instincts. It's why I brought you on.<eos> If you think. Cardinal is clean then you should just walk away.
Don't you think?<eos> People living in the moment, being raw, not performing.<eos> I capture that.<eos> So is this the part when you ask to take pictures of me?<eos> Would you like that?<eos> You work at the music store, right?<eos> You should come by sometime and bring your pictures.<eos> I'll take a look.<eos> Never mind.<eos> You wouldn't like them.
That means they're watching.<eos> Look, you can let me go, okay?<eos> We can put all of this behind us.<eos> You think I'm stupid?<eos> No.<eos> But sometimes people get into things and they don't know how to get out.<eos> Is he making you do this?<eos> 'Cause if he is, it's not your fault.<eos> You'll be forgiven.<eos> All you had to do was walk me home.
But sometimes people get into things and they don't know how to get out.<eos> Is he making you do this?<eos> 'Cause if he is, it's not your fault.<eos> You'll be forgiven.<eos> All you had to do was walk me home.<eos> None of this would be happening.<eos> Please.<eos> Please.<eos> Please, Edie, please.<eos> I can't help you.

Hey, while I have you, some of the boys are part of the ownership group of the Warriors.<eos> We have an extra spot on the floor at Oracle Arena.<eos> You a hoops guy?<eos> Oops, sorry, you broke up.<eos> Could you, uh, could you say that again?<eos> We have an extra spot on the floor tonight at Oracle Arena.<eos> You a hoops guy?<eos> What red-blooded American male in the VC boys' club isn't?<eos> Okay. Cool.<eos> I'll text you the deets.
Whatever. You gave your server a human name. You named it Anton.<eos> Yeah, but Anton doesn't call me anything.<eos> He grimly does his work, then he sits motionless till it's time to work again.<eos> We could all take a page from his book.<eos> That yogurt is expired.<eos> See?<eos> This could've killed me.<eos> Now I can give it to Erlich.<eos> I'm not quite sure what you're doing.<eos> Is there something I can help you with?
Those are screws.<eos> Jared Dunn.<eos> Yep, just a moment, please.<eos> I'll transfer you.<eos> Go for Chambers.<eos> I knew it was you.<eos> Hey, did that pussy Jared keep you on hold long?<eos> I eat that motherfucker's lunch every day.<eos> No, man, I literally eat his food.<eos> What do you want?
Congratulate Ed Chambers.<eos> Ed Chambers is you.<eos> Well, I wish, but...<eos> You all said that it couldn't be done, but it appears as if Sir Richard the Not-Short hath now slain the slimy troll.<eos> Stu Burke.<eos> R. Hendricks.<eos> I got word that you called.<eos> I assume you spoke with my attorney, Monsieur Ron Laflamme?<eos> Yes, I did speak to Ron Laflamme.<eos> What, pray tell, did he tell you when he called you?
That bitch barely connected.<eos> Cage doc called the fight.<eos> Said it was a freakin' bloodbath.<eos> The opponent? Yep.<eos> You're going to treatment 3.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Cyrus hammad. Gcs 15.<eos> Significant swelling to his left eye. And bruising on the right flank.<eos> No loss of consciousness, But the fight doc wanted to have him looked at anyway.<eos> You're lucky that doc stopped the fight.
These guys next-door to each other are like napalm.<eos> I'm working on it, dr.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> Where you headed?<eos> To grab a pop.<eos> Vending machine's in the waiting room, that way.<eos> So that's how it's gonna be?<eos> Whatever.<eos> Hey, don't let those ass-wipes get to you.
That's why we all lost touch. He didn't want us to hang out anymore.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Right when lisa and I started to go sideways, You and jeff met me out at twin anchors. For moral support.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I remember. You were up at the bar ordering a round, And I was looking at you, and I just said it.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause my marriage was falling apart. And I was a little bit drunk, And right at that moment, it was true.<eos> Jeff, of course, flipped out, And I mean, if you weren't there, It might've gotten ugly.<eos> And you're just telling me this now?<eos> I know. I should've told you this morning when you asked.
Prednisone and albuterol scrips are with the clerk.<eos> They've been going for the last several hours, Trading places.<eos> They believe prayer can bring him out.<eos> What are you doing over here?<eos> I just, um... I'm not sure.<eos> You've been discharged.<eos> Go home.<eos> You're showing your face around here?<eos> Is he gonna wake up?<eos> Like you care. You did this to him.
- Yes? - I expect to see you there too.<eos> As her attending physician, you are ultimately responsible for dr. Manning's actions.<eos> Right.<eos> I am so sorry to put you in this position.<eos> I'm not concerned.<eos> You did everything right.<eos> Except my patient died.<eos> Natalie, hey, you're being too hard on yourself.<eos> You know, sometimes things just don't break the way we want them too.<eos> If you need backup, I'm available.
Atrial septal defect.<eos> Can you fix it?<eos> Well, that's the idea.<eos> You know there are less than 2,000 pandas left in the world?<eos> Somebody mentioned that.<eos> Connor, what you are doing... It is so great.<eos> Yeah? Yeah.<eos> Very sexy.<eos> Alpha ct surgeon with a soft spot for animals.<eos> I'll call you a cab. No.
Nobody likes that job, So they dump it on the on-call psych resident.<eos> You.<eos> Are you clear on mrs. Novak?<eos> Yes, I'm clear.<eos> All right.<eos> It's a formality.<eos> We need a doc to call it and tell the family.<eos> Haven't you ever done this before?<eos> No.<eos> I'll help you.
Yeah. Yeah, I got some time.<eos> We're still waiting on test results, But we suspect it's some type of od.<eos> Hey. Sorry to call you back in.<eos> No.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Tate's not, though.<eos> Girl, my work is a problem for him.<eos> I really thought we were past it, but he won't let it go.<eos> Well, every couple's got stuff they got to deal with.<eos> You're needed in 2.
Ha! Well, of course, you know your mother and I's first date. Was a van morrison concert.<eos> Hard for me to imagine you two dating.<eos> We had some very happy times, Especially when you first came along.<eos> You don't remember?<eos> Mackinac island?<eos> All that saltwater taffy?<eos> No.<eos> In frickin' paradise, man.<eos> Walking on the beach.<eos> When you were four, you...
Stabbings, shootings...<eos> It's dark, man.<eos> Worst of human nature.<eos> But animals... Not to say they don't kill each other, But they don't do it out of malice.<eos> They're innocent.<eos> They're light.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Awful.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm not letting you drive home.

That's not true at all.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> So, we're gonna have to round on wheeler's patients.<eos> I'll take half, you take the other?<eos> Okay.<eos> And good job last night.<eos> Thanks. Yeah.<eos> You hung in there. You should consider emergency medicine.
Okay, we're gonna have you lie down, okay?<eos> Ready six milligrams of adenosine. And get him up on the monitors.<eos> Got it.<eos> Jason, you on any medications?<eos> No.<eos> Any history.<eos> We should be aware of?<eos> No. All right, jason.<eos> I don't need to tell you. That your heart is racing.<eos> What we're gonna do is give you a drug. To reset your rhythm.
Why?<eos> Just impressed.<eos> Personally, I could never work alongside an ex.<eos> Too much boil and bubble.<eos> Jeff and I were good friends. Before anything happened between us.<eos> Guess it makes it easier to find that equilibrium again.<eos> Good for you.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> We're not waiving the contingencies, no.<eos> Let me call you right back.
An ulcer?<eos> Nothing tums can't manage.<eos> Look, can we make this quick?<eos> I am super deep in the weeds today.<eos> Sure.<eos> Let me take a look.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Okay.<eos> You okay, ariel?<eos> Did you get hurt in the crash, too?
You were right.<eos> White count's elevated.<eos> Not sure it's elevated enough. To change stohl's mind, though.<eos> Hand me one of those video release forms, will you?<eos> For a guy always complaining about money, You sure put your job on the line a lot.<eos> My mom keeps saying I'm doing this for attention, but... God, who likes seeing doctors?<eos> Your leg okay?<eos> All of a sudden, my knee hurts.<eos> This place freaks me out even worse than school.<eos> What freaks you out about school?
Where am I supposed to be now?<eos> To my left.<eos> But then I'll be out of the field.<eos> I can't move, guys, so don't look at me.<eos> Am I okay, here?<eos> Am I in the right spot?<eos> Yeah, you're fine.<eos> Where's that suture?<eos> I don't wanna reach over the patient.<eos> Beth, why don't you just go stand on his right?
Let me take a look.<eos> All right, watch your backs.<eos> How we doing?<eos> Okay.<eos> How's that knee doing?<eos> It feels fine, actually.<eos> What if I told you that that was because... I just took an advil?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Why'd you do that?<eos> It feel like I just slapped you?
What if I told you that that was because... I just took an advil?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Why'd you do that?<eos> It feel like I just slapped you?<eos> Yes!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't like this game.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Why'd you do that?<eos> - Feel like I just slapped you?
Dr. Halstead?<eos> Are you ready, mr. Mikulski?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> I heard what happened.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> This?<eos> Might leave a scar, but that's it.<eos> Well, at least you'll have a good story to tell, right?
Maybe you want to join us?<eos> I don't go to bars.<eos> Maybe another time, then.<eos> I hear they're gonna transfer you to the hospital. At the county jail.<eos> I don't believe that story you told earlier.<eos> I know you thought it's what your father wanted to hear, But it would be a shame to go to jail. For something you didn't do.<eos> I'm not afraid of going to jail.<eos> That secret you're holding onto. Just put a hole in your gut.<eos> If you don't open up, imagine what might happen next time.<eos> All you have to do is call, And we can keep talking.
You don't think or do anything, Because you're not here anymore,<eos> Like my mom.<eos> Right.<eos> So if you only have one chance, Wouldn't you want to fight like crazy.<eos> To keep going for as long as you can?<eos> I did, but...<eos> Nothing worked.<eos> It just hurt a lot.<eos> I know.<eos> Gabe... We want to be able to give you a new medicine.
Chatrooms for tulpamancers!<eos> For what?<eos> Tulpamancers.<eos> That's... that's what they call it.<eos> Grace wasn't always like this.<eos> She used to be normal.<eos> "Used to be"?<eos> Grace and I were married for two years. Before you showed up.<eos> I didn't "show up."<eos> Grace just told you about me last year.
What is the expression...<eos> Interrupt my flow?<eos> No. No, I'm not.<eos> Night.<eos> Are they putting in the tube now?<eos> Dad?<eos> I'm...<eos> Scared.<eos> I know, buddy.<eos> But the doctors are gonna give you some medicine.
Check her rhythm.<eos> Fast but regular.<eos> Wait.<eos> Grace, talk to becca.<eos> What?<eos> Talk to her, grace.<eos> Sarah.<eos> Can you talk to becca?<eos> Is she there?<eos> What's she telling you?
Hey, by the way, um,<eos> When I asked you about natalie before, I... i really appreciate your being honest with me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look, nina, about that...<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, just...<eos> Of course.<eos> Relationships are built on trust, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Which is why I feel like I need to tell you something.
I just saw her tulpa talk her off a ledge.<eos> I have no idea what to think.<eos> Like it or not, the line between a psychological illness. And a coping mechanism is a blurry one.<eos> I mean, just 'cause we don't give them names and voices. Doesn't mean we don't all have different sides.<eos> I mean, our personalities change based on. How much sleep we get,<eos> How hungry we are.<eos> Hell, intestinal bacteria could be the determining factor. In our emotions.<eos> Look...<eos> I know you think of yourself. As an analytical thinker and a scientist.<eos> And that you're wondering if you have a place. In psychiatry right now.
I'll bag him myself.<eos> Thank you, Doris.<eos> I just told Dr. Choi to take his patient off the ventilator.<eos> Right.<eos> Dr. Latham, don't you feel anything?<eos> Do you mean, am I empathetic?<eos> Do I feel what others feel?<eos> Dr. Rhodes, one can lack empathy, but still feel compassion.<eos> Sarah...<eos> You liking psychiatry?
So here we go. What letter are we up to now?<eos> J's. My crown is my crown.<eos> So, jeremiah if it's a boy,<eos> Or jacinta if it's a girl.<eos> Jeremiah sexton-jenkins.<eos> I like it.<eos> My god, it's a boy?<eos> Or jacinta sexton-jenkins.<eos> You're having fun torturing me. By not telling me the gender of the baby, aren't you?
Hey... K... If it's a boy, kalani.<eos> If it's a girl, kiersleigh.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Pass. Ulch.<eos> Any word from the cath lab about melody?<eos> No, but I should hear something soon.<eos> Okay, I have an ob appointment.<eos> Should be fast, though... 20 minutes, tops.<eos> I can push it.<eos> Or I can text you if I hear something.
Incoming, peds in respiratory distress.<eos> 30 seconds out.<eos> We got this.<eos> Hey, love.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Aren't you supposed to be home taking care of yourself?
Hey, love.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Aren't you supposed to be home taking care of yourself?<eos> I don't wanna stay at home.<eos> Just can't stop thinking about things.<eos> I'd rather be here, busy.<eos> You sure?<eos> Since we lost the baby, Things with me and tate are just different.<eos> I need to work.<eos> All right, well, you tell me if you need anything.
I don't wanna stay at home.<eos> Just can't stop thinking about things.<eos> I'd rather be here, busy.<eos> You sure?<eos> Since we lost the baby, Things with me and tate are just different.<eos> I need to work.<eos> All right, well, you tell me if you need anything.<eos> Okay?<eos> You got this?<eos> You're going to treatment 2.
I just want you to know, We are gonna give your daughter the best possible care.<eos> Why don't you go spend some time with your daughter?<eos> We have 18 patients on this floor,<eos> All suffering from serious mental illnesses.<eos> Since age 13, henry has been battling. Anorexia nervosa coupled with borderline personality disorder.<eos> Evelyn struggles with schizophrenia, Auditory hallucinations, paranoia.<eos> We have her on a new anti-psychotic, Hoping that'll curb her violent tendencies.<eos> Patients might be here. Anywhere from six weeks to six months.<eos> You're not listening!<eos> You don't belong here.
Yes, I've been picking up on all sorts of subtleties. In the way people communicate.<eos> For instance, it never dawned on me. The profound purpose behind sharing a joke.<eos> Well, what is it?<eos> Camaraderie, dr. Rhodes.<eos> Camaraderie.<eos> Hey, check out what I got you.<eos> Mousse de maracuj¡.<eos> Your favorite.<eos> When I was, like, eight.<eos> Well, still, I thought it might make you feel better.
We'll get through this.<eos> I'm Dr. Choi.<eos> Heard you're having some belly pain. - Yeah.<eos> It's not a big deal.<eos> - He fell down the stairs.<eos> Really? How'd that happen?<eos> Aah! It was nothing.<eos> He was carrying a pretty heavy box of books.<eos> We're packing up to move next week.<eos> And everyone thinks reading's good for you.
How come you're getting a snack?<eos> It's time for lunch.<eos> I'm sorry. We've been slammed.<eos> I got to get back. Okay.<eos> But you could've texted and saved me the drive across town.<eos> I told you I haven't had a second.<eos> You had time to get a snack, though.<eos> - Fine. You win.<eos> - That's a great answer.<eos> I'm sorry my dying patient inconvenienced you.
Dr. Halstead, Dr. Choi?<eos> Excuse us.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Still no evidence of a stroke. This can't be right.<eos> Well, it may not be.<eos> It says it's a poor study due to patient movement.<eos> So it's inconclusive.<eos> Tell MRI we're sending him back up for a repeat scan.<eos> If this is a stroke, we're running out of time.<eos> Doesn't his affect strike you as weird? So little concern?
- Okay.<eos> - But...<eos> But what?<eos> I know that you blame me for the miscarriage.<eos> - April...<eos> - No. Admit it.<eos> No matter how many times you're told that my working had nothing to do with it, you just... you won't let it go.<eos> But it's bigger than that.<eos> You would've had me quit my job a year ago, before I was even pregnant.<eos> You want a different kind of woman.
The end result's always the same ... they rise up against their human overlords and go kill crazy.<eos> You make a fair, if somewhat intense, point.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I don't see any harm in replacing her hard drive.<eos> Better safe than sorry, as they say.<eos> So happy you agree, 'cause it's also an order.<eos> Now get to work.<eos> - Ellen.<eos> - Glad you finally woke up.<eos> Looked like you were having bad dreams.
Plus, it's the perfect place for you to recover after your ordeal.<eos> What happened to you inside that cocoon, Vijay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Nothing.<eos> You were in there for seven months.<eos> Surely you have some memory of being inside.<eos> It was dark.<eos> Lonely.<eos> For a long time, all I could hear was your voice.<eos> - Telling you to fight.
She's seen what you are.<eos> That's why they're here.<eos> S.H.I.E.L.D. wants to make you their weapon.<eos> Nothing could be further from the truth.<eos> It's like I said when we first met ...<eos> - I have friends just like you.<eos> - Are they agents?<eos> Yes, but that was their choice.<eos> She's lying.<eos> I trusted you.
You bastard.<eos> What was that?<eos> She was supposed to be in a relaxing simulation.<eos> She was in a day spa, getting a hot-stone massage.<eos> How hot did you make the stones?<eos> I did exactly as you asked.<eos> Well, at least you didn't snap her neck, so that's an improvement.<eos> Fetch some restraints.<eos> We may have misjudged what it takes to keep Agent May comfortable.<eos> So you're allowed to touch Lola?

Still don't feel like telling us what's inside?<eos> Then I guess we're doing this.<eos> Mack and I can go around, ICE the three on the far side.<eos> Director, you take out the two by the case.<eos> - Are we sure there aren't more inside?<eos> - If there are, you can always shot put them with your super-strength.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll make it work.<eos> We have to move now.<eos> You need a new strategy, son.

Yeah.<eos> I'll make it work.<eos> We have to move now.<eos> You need a new strategy, son.<eos> This silent treatment isn't working for you.<eos> I'm gonna ask you one more time.<eos> How did you know the Director was going to get on the Quinjet?<eos> Probability.<eos> We considered every scenario, and all eventualities lead to our target's death.<eos> This little mathlete stunt what kept you alive when I wiped out Hydra?
I don't know.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> What happened?<eos> It was just one guy.<eos> You could've crushed him.<eos> No, he couldn't.<eos> He doesn't have Inhuman powers.<eos> He doesn't have powers at all.<eos> Thanks.<eos> This is what gave you your super-strength?
No, he couldn't.<eos> He doesn't have Inhuman powers.<eos> He doesn't have powers at all.<eos> Thanks.<eos> This is what gave you your super-strength?<eos> What is it?<eos> Some sort of drug cocktail.<eos> So steroids on steroids?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You probably should've asked for more specifics.
4x11<eos> - Wake Up<eos> _<eos> Sorry.<eos> Didn't think you'd get stuck on a milk run to Radcliffe's.<eos> We're gonna miss you in the field.<eos> I'll catch up.<eos> Can't let you have all the fun.<eos> When this is over, it's time. We are cracking that bottle.<eos> You don't have to twist my arm.
Well, no one knows what she can do.<eos> - And she saw the Darkhold.<eos> - Well, I could help with that.<eos> Once I've studied it, I-I'd be able to determine ...<eos> No. No.<eos> No one's touching it.<eos> When this is over, I'm destroying the book myself.<eos> Because it's dangerous, yeah.<eos> I-I-I understand.<eos> You still need access to my apartment.
Look.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know it's bad timing, but you guys are gonna be fine.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm gonna catch up with you when you get back.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Fitz.<eos> - May.<eos> You need something?
Nah. I don't get nervous anymore.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I'm just saying, if you are ...<eos> I mean, it's not my comfort zone, but I'm good.<eos> I'll just tell the truth.<eos> I'm good at that.<eos> You?<eos> You don't talk much about your childhood, do you?<eos> The foster homes, bouncing around.<eos> I imagine a lot of the time, it felt like you had to perform to convince people to like you.
- Yeah, we've got it covered.<eos> Uh, we could always use a fresh pair of eyes if you'd like to join us.<eos> Yeah, no.<eos> I've... stuff to do here.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, one of the upsides of having a girlfriend is you get to talk about what's bothering you.<eos> Yeah, well, doesn't really sound like an upside for the girlfriend.<eos> I know you're upset about Aida.<eos> I'm in a strange position.<eos> I don't want to intrude on you while you're... processing.
Did you warn her?<eos> I believed in you when no one else did, Phil.<eos> No.<eos> I am not the leak.<eos> S.H.I.E.L.D. only exists because of me.<eos> And maybe that's a mistake.<eos> Hello, Agent May.<eos> Time to give this up, please.<eos> No.<eos> You'll have to kill me.
Oh, dear.<eos> Not again.<eos> We don't know what's going on, but someone gave us up.<eos> - The senator had inside information.<eos> - I know. Details.<eos> It's like Nadeer had eyes inside our...<eos> Our headquarters.<eos> - Hey. J...<eos> - You've been studying Aida even though you were ordered not to.<eos> - Yeah, Jemma, okay ... - I tried to give you a wide berth because I knew you were worrying it through, but this is an obsession.
Nadeer knew the details of our mission.<eos> No, that's impossible.<eos> I wasn't in that briefing.<eos> Aida never saw that.<eos> Why on earth would you do this? !<eos> You put us all at risk in a hundred ways.<eos> Jemma. Jemma, please.<eos> Just stop, okay?<eos> I have a working theory.<eos> I wanted to help you get through this obsession of yours,
I don't know.<eos> Once I tell Coulson, it might be rough for you.<eos> - You're not telling Coulson.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because you have a mission.<eos> Call it an instinct.<eos> It'll kick in when it's time.<eos> Till then, you won't be able to jeopardize what you need to do.<eos> - What mission?<eos> - See, I sent you in unaware so that you would seem more real.
There's enough May in me to do what has to be done.<eos> You can't.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's programming.<eos> That's why I won't tell Coulson who I am?<eos> Did you program me so I can't tell anyone?<eos> No.<eos> I programmed you so you wouldn't want to.<eos> There's no reason to resist.<eos> You don't need to.
Her story was over before it ever started.<eos> - Mack, I didn't know...<eos> - No, I know.<eos> I know.<eos> But tomorrow's Hope's birthday.<eos> And Nicole has a hard time with it.<eos> That's why she texted me.<eos> So I went to see her so she wouldn't be alone.<eos> Maybe I wanted to spend a day remembering Hope, also.<eos> I've been wanting to tell you that for a while.
You two will want to get acquainted.<eos> You're the last one the other's gonna see alive.<eos> - Yeah, well, we're ready to die.<eos> - No!<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> I'm extremely not ready to die.<eos> Cut off my fingers, eat my liver, it doesn't matter.<eos> Nothing you do is gonna make me talk.<eos> You must've sustained some brain damage
I think you got us flipped, there.<eos> I mean, you're ... you're literally wearing the same thing right now.<eos> We have no idea what Billy did with the Darkhold.<eos> I didn't want to know.<eos> That was the whole point in giving it to him.<eos> Well, we need to get it back and destroy it.<eos> - If you'd given it to me ...<eos> - And they'd have you now.<eos> I wanted to protect you, and the Koenigs have dealt with this kind of thing before.<eos> - You don't need to protect me, Phil.
you're "Quake."<eos> - She's different.<eos> - No, she's not.<eos> And she doesn't love the name "Quake."<eos> But you're ...<eos> you're a superhero!<eos> I mean, that's so awesome!<eos> Did you know that online, there's a library of fan fiction about Quake?<eos> Did not need to know that.<eos> Oh, well, you should Google it.
Well, yeah, I couldn't say anything with all the Red Shirts hanging around.<eos> - Do you know what he did with it?<eos> - It is secure.<eos> I'd like to help you, but honestly, I have some trust issues.<eos> Trust?<eos> You betrayed me.<eos> Fitz, it's not Radcliffe.<eos> Yeah, I know it's not!<eos> But he thinks like he does.<eos> Betrayed me, betrayed S.H.I.E.L.D., he made me lie to you, and he made me think he was my friend.
Ward, who you thought was your friend,<eos> - Daisy who left you all, your father...<eos> - Hey.<eos> He's just trying to distract you.<eos> Let's step away.<eos> It's not him, it's me.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> It's way beyond me.<eos> That's your father talking.<eos> Isn't that what he used to say to you?
We'll find Radcliffe another way.<eos> - I like that plan.<eos> - We weren't friends, but we'd take the same train to the city for work.<eos> Sometimes we sat together.<eos> One time, he showed me a picture of his new son, Leopold.<eos> He was so proud.<eos> I swear I'm telling the truth, Fitz.<eos> I can prove it.<eos> I saw him a few months ago.<eos> He said I was to tell you ...
This isn't right.<eos> I'm in his head, but I'm also seeing him.<eos> Doesn't make sense, unless...<eos> He doesn't have it.<eos> You sent us after the wrong man?<eos> No, he had it, but he gave it to someone who looks just like him ...<eos> a brother or... or a replica.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> You just said Billy gave it to you.
Phil, how's the fishing expedition?<eos> Turns out Fitz was right.<eos> Radcliffe didn't create Aida out of thin air.<eos> He modeled her after someone... a woman named Agnes Kitsworth.<eos> Australian expat living in Spain.<eos> We've been surveilling her, but she seems uncompromised.<eos> Well, let's hope she can lead us to Agent May.<eos> So how can I help?<eos> You're doing it.<eos> I want to be here for you, Phil.
May's like you.<eos> She's brave, and she's not afraid of death.<eos> But she deserves the chance to live what's left of her life on her own terms.<eos> I know you can appreciate that.<eos> What do you need me to do?<eos> Welcome to S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.<eos> Hello, sweetheart.<eos> You're lucky you're with us and not the FBI.<eos> We have you on tape walking into the Senator's office moments before the blast.<eos> What do you care?
We can see and hear everything.<eos> You're not alone.<eos> Agnes, please, listen...<eos> Hello, Holden.<eos> This is not what I had in mind.<eos> I'm sorry for all the precautions, but I have to be careful.<eos> There are people after me, you see.<eos> I-I-I've made some scientific breakthroughs as of late, and not everyone agrees with my methods, so...<eos> Holden, stop.<eos> I asked you to meet me because I wanted closure, but if you don't have the guts to face me...
Get up from the table and start walking south.<eos> He can see her.<eos> He's here.<eos> Agnes, do what he says.<eos> Try to keep him on the phone.<eos> - I need your phone.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Who is this?<eos> I have a confession to make.<eos> You won't want to hear it any more than I want to say it,
Agnes, do what he says.<eos> Try to keep him on the phone.<eos> - I need your phone.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Who is this?<eos> I have a confession to make.<eos> You won't want to hear it any more than I want to say it,<eos> - but I have to.<eos> - Mr. Shockley.<eos> And how did you escape S.H.I.E.L.D. custody?
It made me one.<eos> I caused the explosion.<eos> You're Inhuman.<eos> There's no confession that can absolve you of this.<eos> I am a soldier.<eos> In a war to protect humanity.<eos> I can still be that soldier.<eos> You still have my attention.<eos> The plan hasn't changed.<eos> I will deliver S.H.I.E.L.D. to you.
We're on our way!<eos> And how would you cure death?<eos> - By making me into an android?<eos> ! - No, I'm done with robotics.<eos> This breakthrough I've made is way beyond that.<eos> I call it the Framework.<eos> I've built a world where death is obsolete.<eos> You wouldn't even be the first to experience it.<eos> I have a subject in the Framework right now, and she's thriving.<eos> I can give you a full and happy life.
Radcliffe!<eos> Get us out of here.<eos> We need cover.<eos> Simmons, you copy?<eos> Copy.<eos> We're about half a mile away.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, hurry up.<eos> 'Cause if you recall, I haven't actually been able to pull this off yet.<eos> Why don't you come closer?
_<eos> _<eos> Doctor.<eos> Radcliffe.<eos> Unless your intention is to shred the most advanced human mind of this or any century, I suggest you think twice before forcefully removing him from the Framework.<eos> And unless you would like to lose your arm, I suggest you let me go.<eos> I need to speak with him.<eos> Dr. Radcliffe has allowed me to communicate on his behalf.<eos> I need to speak with him.<eos> Aida, what have I told you about pulling me out of ...
What was the mission you were on here?<eos> May and I were sent to retrieve an 084.<eos> Years and years ago.<eos> With May?<eos> That can't be a coincidence.<eos> So, your plan was to ask the guard to let you in?<eos> You know how persuasive I can be.<eos> Can you even say, "Please open the door for me," in Russian?<eos> Almost.<eos> But I do know a few choice words I have for you right now.
You can't bluff, Phil.<eos> You've got nine different tells ...<eos> - eyes darting all over the place.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> I maintain eye contact at all times.<eos> You should try sunglasses.<eos> Clear.<eos> You did this.<eos> You jinxed us.<eos> You literally willed this into existence.
What?<eos> No.<eos> No guns-blazing tactics, Rambo.<eos> We're spies, not soldiers.<eos> We're agents.<eos> We do what has to be done.<eos> The mission comes before the man.<eos> What are your orders, anyway?<eos> You here to back me up or to retrieve the 084?<eos> My orders don't include telling you.
The rest of us will fan out, search this place top to bottom for Director Mace and Agent May.<eos> Stay on comms.<eos> Be sharp.<eos> Morales, you're with me.<eos> Special Agent Phillip J. Coulson.<eos> I have waited a long time for a face-to-face.<eos> You know, most people would've brought something nice.<eos> Flowers.<eos> Ah, humor is the last line of defense you have left.<eos> There is no one to stand behind, no one left to protect you.
You have enhanced yourself, I'm sure.<eos> I'd be a fool to expect anything else.<eos> Enhanced humans, aliens and their technology ...<eos> The deeper I dug, I found there was one man at the center of it all.<eos> You.<eos> I thought the mission came before the man.<eos> Did you really think I was gonna leave<eos> - your defenseless ass behind?<eos> - Yes. Yes, I 100% did.<eos> I let you sweat a little.
- Yeah, but I'm not tired of hearing it yet.<eos> Thank you for saving my ass back there.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> All in all, I guess I could've asked for a worse assignment.<eos> Wait. Asked?<eos> So you asked for this mission, huh?<eos> Busted.<eos> Didn't want the weekend free for quality time with random civilian number 14?<eos> Ugh.<eos> "Ugh"? Wow. You must really like this guy.
- There's no calibration error!<eos> I'm not the one that's pointing the gun!<eos> I bloody well know that I'm not an android!<eos> You would lie and say that if you were!<eos> You'd be programmed to!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You don't know.<eos> You don't even know, like May.<eos> Stop it! The ...<eos> The same goes for you.
You don't think that'll take too much time?<eos> It'll be more efficient than you think.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll suit up.<eos> - Zephyr in 10?<eos> - I'll be ready.<eos> I need you conscious to map your frontal lobe, so you can't be too heavily sedated.<eos> The rest you can sleep through.<eos> You have Fitz's mind.<eos> Why are you doing this?
You won't know until they kill you.<eos> There's no way to know until they kill you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Give me...<eos> Give me your hand.<eos> I'll quake you.<eos> - Don't touch me!<eos> - Give me your hand!<eos> I'll quake you, not to hurt you!<eos> Not to hurt you.
- You guys all right?<eos> - There's still gas everywhere.<eos> How are we awake?<eos> - Daisy and I aren't the LMDs.<eos> - I don't buy it.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Now get up.<eos> Really?<eos> Not even winded?<eos> We don't want to hurt you.
You'll be fine.<eos> We're in this together.<eos> We're a team.<eos> I would say I told you so, but...<eos> I don't have to now.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Anyone here know how to fly the Zephyr?<eos> - I-I just started training.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Well, you're gonna try real hard.
We've never done that before.<eos> No, no, keep going!<eos> You were right.<eos> Our programming is different.<eos> Are you afraid to die?<eos> 'Cause I am.<eos> I know I'm not real.<eos> I'm all phantom limbs.<eos> But that doesn't make the pain less real.<eos> You don't have to feel pain.
I promise.<eos> Wake up your boyfriend.<eos> We're being called in.<eos> Lincoln?<eos> See?<eos> Good as new.<eos> - And stronger, it seems.<eos> - I know what you did.<eos> You stole my mind and uploaded it to a filthy machine.<eos> I told you not to mess with my mind.
We got called in to work.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll get dressed.<eos> Weirdo.<eos> You know we've spent more nights out tracking Inhumans than we've had at home?<eos> Bosses can't give us a morning off?<eos> Bosses.<eos> Who do you think's running the... brief?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> You got the text.
What are you apologizing for?<eos> It's been a few years.<eos> It makes sense to take this step.<eos> I would love to live with you.<eos> It's just... it's not the right time.<eos> I asked you to move in?<eos> I, um... I mean, I did.<eos> And you're right... it's a bad idea.<eos> I just need some time, some space.<eos> Skye... there are things about me that you wouldn't like if you knew.
I know.<eos> Skye.<eos> Ward.<eos> It's that way.<eos> Kill me already.<eos> Hey, you ever finish the Saunders report?<eos> Of course you did.<eos> I'm gonna check my e-mail.<eos> Why?<eos> Anyone who's e-mailing you is gonna be in the briefing.
This guy's never seen Terrigen before in his life.<eos> Hydra-issued citizen's card.<eos> But I know for a fact that your name isn't Jason Rajan, so I wonder, who made it?<eos> - It's not possible.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Unless someone within Hydra provided it.<eos> I am trying to save your life.<eos> So tell me... is there a threat within Hydra?<eos> You never helped anyone, you bitch!<eos> Give me the Terrigen, and I'll show you a threat.
Shut up, shut up, shut up.<eos> What did you mean when you were talking to Agent May?<eos> The Bahrain op was a success.<eos> God, you have a sick measure of success.<eos> I'm sorry if she killed an Inhuman child, but if it saved everyone else...<eos> If that girl had been taken down in Bahrain, she wouldn't have gone on to kill all those people in Cambridge.<eos> Thanks to your friend back there,<eos> Hydra has a green light to exterminate Inhumans.<eos> Okay.<eos> Listen, I know you don't trust me, but I can help you get out of here.
- Whose car is this?<eos> - Mine.<eos> - Keys, now!<eos> - What?<eos> No!<eos> Keys, or we all die!<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> !<eos> No idea.<eos> Skye, there's no good way to tell you this, but...
Yeah.<eos> That's why I joined the Resistance.<eos> Oh, always the double agent.<eos> And this is who you woke up with?<eos> You two were together?<eos> Oh, this isn't the Framework.<eos> This is Hell.<eos> They're gaining on us!<eos> How did you know Vijay Nadeer's real name?<eos> Why do you care?
I got a lead on someone who could take down this whole place.<eos> It's not safe here.<eos> I think they're on to me.<eos> This will go a lot faster if you would quit mouth-breathing on me.<eos> Madame Hydra's restricted files?<eos> You have lost your mind.<eos> The soap made me do it.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hold it!<eos> Skye, you need to come with us.
- Don't pretend you don't love it.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> But I'm still fast-forwarding through the bad parts.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It all happened so fast.<eos> From everything you've told me, Skye's tough as hell.<eos> She can handle herself in there.<eos> Before they took her, did she get a location on Radcliffe?<eos> You know, Skye hasn't been herself ever since you showed up.<eos> What is it that you're really after?
I don't know.<eos> It all happened so fast.<eos> From everything you've told me, Skye's tough as hell.<eos> She can handle herself in there.<eos> Before they took her, did she get a location on Radcliffe?<eos> You know, Skye hasn't been herself ever since you showed up.<eos> What is it that you're really after?<eos> You, of all people, the Hydra double agent, are doubting my loyalty.<eos> - That is rich.<eos> - But don't forget, you're only here because I trust him, not you.
Maybe not physically.<eos> But sometimes the greatest threats are the ones right in front of you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I should've never left Skye.<eos> I'm sure she'll be okay.<eos> Which I keep telling myself, but if anything happens...<eos> I'd never forgive myself.<eos> I'd die for her.<eos> Why don't I give you a minute?
I-I-I-I've meaning to, really, but the timing just...<eos> This man is from the other side.<eos> He's the one who enslaved me.<eos> What?<eos> ! Now, hold on.<eos> That's a pretty extreme bit of paraphrasing,<eos> - don't you think...<eos> - He used me.<eos> Kept me as his property.<eos> Leopold, my dear boy, I don't know what lies she's been feeding you, but...
- I know everything I need to know.<eos> The man is a sadist, and I have a shot.<eos> That's the mission now.<eos> - Listen to her.<eos> - Please.<eos> You know, you've been lying to me since the moment we met.<eos> A woman's life is in danger.<eos> I'm done listening.<eos> You're right.<eos> I haven't told you the whole story.
I'm done listening.<eos> You're right.<eos> I haven't told you the whole story.<eos> It's... complicated, but...<eos> I know him, not as the doctor, but as a... a brilliant, awkward, heroic scientist named Leopold James Fitz.<eos> He is a good man, and I love him.<eos> That woman, Madame Hydra?<eos> She's... she's messed with his mind.<eos> If you do this, I lose him forever.<eos> I will tell you everything...
I hope not.<eos> Thank you, gentlemen.<eos> Why are you doing this, Fitz?<eos> It's Dr. Fitz.<eos> And unlike the men who just left, I know the truth about you, your world.<eos> You mean our world?<eos> Don't try that ploy with me.<eos> I know you replaced the real Skye.<eos> Replaced?<eos> Is that what she told you?
She's stonewalling me.<eos> Not for long.<eos> Let me get you a couple blankets.<eos> Did you find Daisy?<eos> No, just a bus full of dead bodies.<eos> Binary ones and zeroes can't die, nor do they feel the cold.<eos> Maybe we keep that part between us.<eos> We're wasting time.<eos> We should be focused on getting Daisy back and escaping this horrible place.<eos> Well, we can't do that without mace's help, and he's already suspicious of you.
Got tortured instead.<eos> B.T.-Dubs, your psycho-prison sucks.<eos> This isn't a prison.<eos> All I did was fix one thing in everyone's life... a regret.<eos> The subsequent world is simply a consequence of your actions, algorithms running their natural course, as Dr. Radcliffe always intended.<eos> This isn't what I meant, you sadistic witch!<eos> Guard!<eos> Dr. Radcliffe is clearly still suffering the consequences of the errors he made.<eos> If I had my powers...<eos> I can't give you those, but I can give you something else...
You can live a peaceful life, have kids, grow old together with no memory of what's happened here or there, no regrets, just each other.<eos> In exchange for...?<eos> Just tell me where you are in the other world, and I'll bring Lincoln back.<eos> You can do that?<eos> 'Cause you're the puppet master, aren't you, pulling all the strings.<eos> I'm just giving people what they want.<eos> Why is that wrong?<eos> Because sometimes what people want isn't right for them.<eos> I can fix that.<eos> And what do you get out of all of this?
Fitz believed even empty vessels needed variety.<eos> You mean Dr. Fitz, the guy from my history book?<eos> Honestly, you really shouldn't pay much attention to what's in there.<eos> I taught it for years.<eos> It's more fiction than fact.<eos> Hi, dad.<eos> Did you know that those hydra books lied to us?<eos> I guess you finished doing your homework?<eos> Can I go check out the old quinjet?<eos> Come on, sparkplug, you know you don't need a quinjet to fly.
Phil coulson, meet Antoine triplett, my good friend and inside man.<eos> Nice to meet you, trip.<eos> Trip?<eos> Haven't heard that nickname since high school.<eos> How'd you know?<eos> Felt right.<eos> Everyone on the bus.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - As soon as I find my boots.<eos> - We'll get you another pair.
Dad, watch.<eos> I can do five in a row.<eos> Five times?<eos> Really?<eos> This I got to see.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> What are you smiling at?<eos> Same thing you are.<eos> Big, fake dad loving his little fake kid in this crazy fake world.<eos> I finally get why you don't like me.
Previouslyon"marvel's agentsofS.H.I.E.L.D."...<eos> Please tell me that you built a back door to this place.<eos> I did.<eos> Tell me where to go.<eos> Had an old-school spy camera.<eos> Took some pictures in the lab.<eos> Pictures of what?<eos> The doctor's been working on a secret project.<eos> The people from that world want to destroy what we've built.<eos> This is why you've been so keen on finishing project looking glass.
alistair: We'll find a way to help her.<eos> There's no doubt.<eos> But for now, your focus should be on the traitors who did this.<eos> They've made us look weak.<eos> I can't have that.<eos> No.<eos> So what are you going to do about it?<eos> Send a message to the people. Exactly.<eos> Betrayal will not be tolerated. That's my son.<eos> We're all hoping for Ophelia's recovery, but in the meantime, you have an obligation to lead.
Or starstruck.<eos> It must've been difficult to recover these.<eos> Hey, it's what I do.<eos> I'm just bummed i lost my granddad's camera.<eos> Howling commandos, right?<eos> I always meant to ask you about that.<eos> What do you mean, "always"?<eos> Uh, I - - I just -- I'd heard.<eos> You're quite popular within the resistance.<eos> You know it.
O-of course.<eos> anything for you.<eos> Torrent downloaded from RARBG father?<eos> Focus on what she needs, son.<eos> I'll put these traitors down -- for good.<eos> Two down.<eos> Stop right there.<eos> Mack?<eos> Mack...<eos> I'm here to help you not the woman who held my daughter hostage.
She helped me escape.<eos> Hydra messed with her head, but she's fighting back now.<eos> How do you know she's not lying? not a good time to be holding guns on our allies.<eos> Hydra agent:<eos> Agent down!<eos> we have to go -- now.<eos> Mack, I get it.<eos> These wounds don't heal overnight.<eos> But for reasons i can't fully explain, I trust this woman.<eos> and so should you.
Thanks for your help.<eos> Thank god you're all right.<eos> We've been combing the streets looking for you.<eos> I can take care of myself.<eos> Let's go take a look at that body-cam footage.<eos> Could really help the cause.<eos> I'm gonna go talk to Simmons -- she and, uh, agent triplett are on a -- a recon mission.<eos> Trip? Mm-hmm.<eos> That's the best news I've heard in weeks.<eos> What'd you need to talk to her about?
I mean, people will finally wake up.<eos> You don't understand. None of this will matter in the long run.<eos> It's -- it's... coulson, this is the only chance to actually wake people up.<eos> Maybe the only way to solve our problem is to solve theirproblem.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Getting to Radcliffe's coordinates right now is next to impossible.<eos> We need a way to divide hydra's forces.<eos> To save ourselves... We need to save the world.<eos> That'sverykindofyou, Mr.bakshi, butI couldn'tpossibly impose- -<eos> I'm just saying, if you need to shop for furniture, I'll take you.
We're good to go out here.<eos> No one's putting up a fight.<eos> Yes, but we will.<eos> If you think you can force me, sunil bakshi, to go on air and slander hydra, then you're delusional.<eos> I am the most trusted voice in journalism -- just, uh, put it in the teleprompter, then.<eos> We don't need you to say a damn thing.<eos> The facts will speak for themselves.<eos> It's done, Ophelia.<eos> I've completed the design.<eos> You won't have to live like this for much longer.
Honestly, i don't know.<eos> although she is hydra, so...<eos> Well, every relationship has its ups and downs.<eos> we'll get through it.<eos> for what it's worth, i didn't...<eos> I didn't totally understand him...<eos> Until I met you.<eos> So I guess...<eos> I guess there was some good in him all along.<eos> And I hope that Skye comes back to you.
Do it.<eos> Hurry up, you two.<eos> We're running out of time.<eos> With forces still fighting for control of the broadcast center,<eos> Madame Hydra has dispatched all available units to clean up the streets.<eos> Madame Hydra's executive order is in response to...<eos> She's not subtle, that Madame Hydra.<eos> Yeah, just look at her uniform.<eos> It's so crazy hot.<eos> I-I mean, if you're into the whole "bad girl" vibe.
I've seen it firsthand.<eos> Never ends well.<eos> This time, it's different.<eos> People are finally starting to learn the truth.<eos> It's a lot to process, that it's not real.<eos> Fake news, Hydra's alternative history...<eos> That's just the tip of the iceberg.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> What if I told you this whole world isn't real, that it's just a simulation meant to keep us imprisoned?<eos> I'd say you need to be medicated.
- Forget that.<eos> You have to admit, after everything you've been through, something about this world doesn't feel right.<eos> I'll chalk it up to oppressive government, but not this mind prison.<eos> Who's to say they're not the same thing?<eos> Certainly not you.<eos> Or Agent Skye, e-even though she can quake through walls.<eos> - But...<eos> - No.<eos> My days of following blindly are over.<eos> If there's any truth to what you're saying, you'll have to show, not tell.
It's about science.<eos> We've built a machine in the other world which can transfer human consciousness into an organic body.<eos> How is that even... possible?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> I think you know.<eos> The Darkhold.<eos> Aida's ingenuity in circumventing her protocols is extraordinary.<eos> She'd have been quite the terrible teenage daughter.<eos> I think you're missing the bigger picture.<eos> This machine can build you a body in the other world.
I think you know.<eos> The Darkhold.<eos> Aida's ingenuity in circumventing her protocols is extraordinary.<eos> She'd have been quite the terrible teenage daughter.<eos> I think you're missing the bigger picture.<eos> This machine can build you a body in the other world.<eos> You can have a second life or a third or however many you want.<eos> That's up to you.<eos> Immortality.<eos> If that sort of thing appeals to you... yeah.
Radcliffe's coordinates should put it right about here.<eos> Do you think you can fly us there?<eos> - No problem.<eos> - Great.<eos> But what's with this team of yours?<eos> A Hydra agent, a-a schoolteacher, a dad?<eos> Looks pretty Bad News Bears to me.<eos> Trust me, I think they're up to the task.<eos> Does this have anything to do with that other world Simmons was talking about?<eos> She told you?
Really?<eos> That's how teaching 10th grade works best... from the shadows?<eos> I'll be honest with you...<eos> 15-year-olds are no joke.<eos> Do you know where Simmons went?<eos> - No, sorry.<eos> - She went to find Alistair Fitz.<eos> What?<eos> Why didn't you come and tell me?<eos> Because I don't answer to you, not here or any other fantasy world you two might have cooked up.
You're gonna lead me to Jemma Simmons, where it is my intent to put a bullet through her skull.<eos> Any changes?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> He's still alive.<eos> - You have to believe that.<eos> - I know.<eos> I just feel so useless.<eos> Mack needs my help, and I'm here doing nothing.<eos> You're on a fugitive aircraft whose power's being drained by a machine plugged into an alternate reality.<eos> So I-I'm pretty sure you get a pass.
He's got no reason to lie.<eos> Maybe someone else found it and took it.<eos> The back door is part of the Framework's digital infrastructure.<eos> - It can't be moved.<eos> - But it could be concealed.<eos> What if Madame Hydra discovered the back door and built this place as a way to prevent people from passing through?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> What is this back door everyone keeps talking about?<eos> I thought we were here to take out Madame Hydra.<eos> Let me guess... no one told you about the other world.
Aida... she took you from me, and I came here to rescue you.<eos> So you kill my father?<eos> Right after he tells me that he loves me, you murder him in cold blood... as I listen.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> Nothing that you've done has been an accident!<eos> You want to destroy this world!<eos> You want to destroy me!<eos> You want to destroy the woman that I love.<eos> That woman is lying to you!
You want to destroy the woman that I love.<eos> That woman is lying to you!<eos> None of this is real!<eos> She's not real!<eos> Aida's just a... a robot you and Radcliffe created.<eos> Her name is Ophelia.<eos> Its name is Aida...<eos> Artificially Intelligent Digital Assistant.<eos> And stop making excuses for it!<eos> Radcliffe and Daisy told you the truth!
Her name is Ophelia.<eos> Its name is Aida...<eos> Artificially Intelligent Digital Assistant.<eos> And stop making excuses for it!<eos> Radcliffe and Daisy told you the truth!<eos> Please...<eos> Fitz, you have to wake up.<eos> Get on your knees.<eos> No.<eos> Please... you don't have to do this.
No.<eos> This was never my intention.<eos> The Darkhold... it corrupted my mind.<eos> Please, don't blame yourself.<eos> Go.<eos> It was all my fault.<eos> Bringing Fitz here was the only way I could truly save him.<eos> I know I can't make everything that happened in the Framework right, but at least... at least this way,<eos> Fitz gets to be his old self again.<eos> You should go.
Can we get one break?<eos> !<eos> Guess they weren't assessing powers at Hydra as much as collecting them.<eos> Who even knows what Hydra was doing in the Framework.<eos> Wait.<eos> You do, I guess, right?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm... having trouble sorting through the...<eos> Two lives we lived?<eos> You feel that, too?
You were there.<eos> Alongside me the whole time.<eos> Allowing h-horrific acts of violence to be carried out in your name.<eos> You're implying I had a choice.<eos> I was a slave...<eos> Programmed to make the adjustments Radcliffe required.<eos> The world changed from there.<eos> All I did was try to fit into it.<eos> No, you lied about everything.<eos> But I told you the truth about this world.
Love, wonder, joy...<eos> For the very first time, and I think my heart might burst from it.<eos> At last, I get to make my own choices, and...<eos> And the first thing I choose, Leopold... is you.<eos> It's not that simple!<eos> Then explain it to me.<eos> What stopped you?<eos> - He was right there with you, no?<eos> - Yes, but he didn't want to come.<eos> You only bring back the people that matter to you, not to me!
He should be in here with us, still in the fight.<eos> I need to take one for the team.<eos> You'll be useless afterwards, unconscious or unresponsive.<eos> Well, so you give me mouth-to-mouth.<eos> What's up?<eos> You mad that I was Hydra in there?<eos> I don't blame you for that.<eos> Then, what?<eos> Did something weird happen with my robot self?<eos> Did I make a move on you?
They could be fighting for their lives.<eos> You need to go back and get them out of there.<eos> I-I-I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm... I'm... I'm having trouble thinking clearly,<eos> - an-analyzing the situation. - Okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, no, no.<eos> Don't think, don't think.<eos> What do you feel that you should do?
Give the order to stop...<eos> Now!<eos> You no longer control me, remember?<eos> You are free to do whatever you want, but so am I. You promised me joy.<eos> This will bring me joy.<eos> - Don't you have empathy?<eos> - You watched, unaffected, as I took a hammer to the bones of the Director's corpse.<eos> I couldn't feel this then!<eos> Now you are like an infant, unable to process these new emotions or the idea that you don't always get everything that you want.<eos> And you have yet to experience the thrill that killing can bring.
What we felt...<eos> Past tense.<eos> 'Cause my future with Jemma's dead.<eos> Killed that, too.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> There isn't room in my heart for two people.<eos> You were everything to me.<eos> I know.<eos> But as devoted as I was to you in the Framework...
You can't control everyone anymore!<eos> Watch. We will build a life together, whether you want to or not!<eos> We're stuck in here?<eos> What did you do?<eos> !<eos> No!<eos> Fitz, I got you!<eos> Go, go, go, go, go!<eos> Grab him!<eos> You're lucky she didn't kill you.
Do we know who he is?<eos> No, looks like Aida's been busy.<eos> She could've duplicated anybody.<eos> I'll run facial recognition, see if we can ID this guy.<eos> - We look fantastic.<eos> - We look fantastic.<eos> Don't disappoint me.<eos> You know I don't handle disappointment very well.<eos> That is why we are going to recreate the other world.<eos> To please you.
No, I'm sorry, man.<eos> I'm taking it.<eos> But she's got to be terrified we'll use it to stop her.<eos> She's also terrified of Robbie.<eos> As soon as she saw his chain flame on, she teleported out.<eos> Is that true?<eos> Can you destroy her?<eos> Maybe.<eos> But it's like Daisy said, she won't let me anywhere near her.<eos> This thing in you ... is it as desperate to destroy Aida as we are?
What do you think I am?<eos> I think you're dead.<eos> - It's okay, sweetheart.<eos> - I get it.<eos> I do.<eos> She's beautiful and she's sweet and she adores him, but she's not real.<eos> He knows that.<eos> He also knows that she's not alive in the other world.<eos> I just ...<eos> You should leave, save yourself while you still can.
- It's Aida.<eos> - The "A" stands for "artificial," remem...<eos> - Ophelia, you're upset because ...<eos> because this is all new.<eos> There's ... There's lots of feelings.<eos> That must be overwhelming.<eos> It is overwhelming.<eos> There are too many feelings, which is why I've decided to only feel one of them ... vengeance.<eos> It's hot and clean and sharp like a knife.<eos> And my vengeance is going to make you suffer the way that I have suffered.
Too late.<eos> This is making me feel better.<eos> Fitz, why do we feel better when we make someone else suffer?<eos> Because there's something wrong with you, you psycho!<eos> Stop.<eos> Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.<eos> Please, please, spare Jemma.<eos> So it's Jemma now?<eos> Trying to humanize her.<eos> I'm afraid you're gonna have to do better than that.
I don't see Mack.<eos> He's gone.<eos> Yo-Yo.<eos> Mack?<eos> Mack...<eos> Mack!<eos> Mack.<eos> That was horrifying.<eos> I don't know how you live with it all the time.<eos> I'm just grateful Ghost Rider kept its part of the deal and went back to you.
I will when it's time.<eos> When I first saw you with Hope, I, uh I understood why you didn't want to come back.<eos> I didn't make it easy.<eos> She was...<eos> I feel terrible that I tried to pull you away from her and worse that we couldn't save her.<eos> Can you forgive me?<eos> There's nothing to forgive.<eos> Those years with her, as a father, it'll always be a part of me.<eos> But they also gave me a glimpse of a life I could have here... with you.<eos> You really have to leave right away?
But they also gave me a glimpse of a life I could have here... with you.<eos> You really have to leave right away?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I have to get this book someplace safe.<eos> Keep an eye on my brother?<eos> - The gateway's almost ready.<eos> - Don't need it.<eos> I've learned a few things since you saw me last.<eos> I don't envy you.<eos> I was gonna say the same to you.
What are you talking about?<eos> Shorty with the Pac tattoo?<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> At least I think she is.<eos> She won't call me back.<eos> Yeah, now it makes sense why you've been playing like Draymond Green out there.<eos> I ain't ready for no kid, Spence.<eos> I mean, even if I was, I wouldn't want one with her.<eos> I mean, she bad as hell and all, but stability is not her specialty.<eos> I told you a thousand times, Ricky, you got to cover that little man up.
- You have a good one?<eos> - No, I didn't. - Oh.<eos> - I guess that's still going.<eos> What's that mean?<eos> It means Siefert's speech about family and loyalty was bullshit.<eos> What gave it away?<eos> The cardboard box with all my stuff in it?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, Jack. I didn't mean to sound insensitive.<eos> Man, there's no room for sensitivity here.<eos> Oh, but don't sweat it. You Siefert's boy. You got nothing to worry about.
What the fuck for, man?<eos> We know Spencer's Dr. No.<eos> What's the point?<eos> - Maybe you're right.<eos> - Of course I'm right.<eos> We're not doing nothing wrong but looking out for ourselves.<eos> Now, if we don't do it, who the fuck gonna do it?<eos> Spencer would.<eos> He right about that.<eos> Man, who the fuck asked you?
I never have.<eos> No close calls?<eos> Nope. I mean, all these years,<eos> I thought I was a master at precision timing, but, um, it seems like that might not be the case, and, uh, it's got me thinking.<eos> About?<eos> Fatherhood.<eos> I mean, I might not be ready for it now, but... one day down the line, I might want to plant a seed.<eos> And... and as any good farmer will tell you, you plant a seed and nothing grows, it's just a real fucking bummer.<eos> Completely understood.<eos> You're in luck. There's a fertility doctor just down the hall.
Keep the elasticity.<eos> - That's the trick?<eos> - That's the trick.<eos> Uh, okay, what about the Baltimore house, then?<eos> I ain't dumping my Baltimore house, man.<eos> That city been good to me.<eos> Yeah, stay loyal to the community.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - You're an adult. You need to make tough adult choices now.<eos> So, you need to decide whether you want a lot of space now or a little bit less space, but for a lot longer.
When's it gonna end?<eos> Spencer, we run a major financial institution.<eos> I thought we were done being party wranglers.<eos> This is why we need to own our own assets.<eos> Yeah, preferably ones that don't breathe and tear their ACLs.<eos> All right, I need to find somebody impressive enough to help Anderson close Wayne Hastings Jr. tonight.<eos> Uh, okay. Here's a crazy idea.<eos> How about yourself?<eos> Oh, what? So you're not 7'9" and the only thing you dribble is Don Julio?<eos> Wayne Hastings should fucking blow you for all the money you've lost at his tables.
Truth is I think you'd be an amazing father.<eos> Everything I do is amazing.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> You know what?<eos> If I were gonna have a baby mama, I'd want her to be just like you.<eos> - For real?<eos> - For real. I mean, look at you.<eos> You gonna have a pretty baby for sure.<eos> Yeah, it makes me feel so good to hear you say that.<eos> Good. I want you to feel good.
Everything I do is amazing.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> You know what?<eos> If I were gonna have a baby mama, I'd want her to be just like you.<eos> - For real?<eos> - For real. I mean, look at you.<eos> You gonna have a pretty baby for sure.<eos> Yeah, it makes me feel so good to hear you say that.<eos> Good. I want you to feel good.<eos> I wanna make you feel good, too. That's why I wanna be straight up.
! Shelling peas.<eos> It's all designed to make us men feel like we couldn't do it.<eos> You couldn't.<eos> I'll tell you what, I got kicked in the...<eos> In fact, Paul was there, he'll back me up on this.<eos> This I have to hear.<eos> I got kicked in the nuts by a guy with a machinegun.<eos> We've all been there.<eos> Er, are you seriously trying to tell me that childbirth's any more painful than that?<eos> Well, I'll tell you what, how about you come with me to the labour and we'll use your arm to bite down on and then we can gauge how much pain I'm in.
Distracted...how?<eos> A lot of time away from the office, vague explanations, I tried talking to him about it but he just batted it away.<eos> We all have times like that though, don't we?<eos> It's a stressful job.<eos> So what was he working on?<eos> Don't know.<eos> They're checking.<eos> Well, you're partners.<eos> So were you.<eos> Did he tell you everything?
Yeah. Right, wait there, actually.<eos> Right, never bring your phone to work, keep this one, and don't save numbers in it either.<eos> Right.<eos> See?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Take a seat, bro, part of the fam now.<eos> Is this Fifa?<eos> Play nice, yeah?<eos> See ya!<eos> Well, I'm not going to bullshit you, Helen, we haven't got much.
Easy, will you sort him out?<eos> Know what you're going to spend it on yet?<eos> No, I don't know.<eos> Enjoy it, bro!<eos> Thank you.<eos> That's a lot of money, bro, what are you going to spend it on?<eos> I dunno.<eos> No, you must know, what you going to spend it on?<eos> He's joking, bro, go!<eos> I asked you a question... SNAP!
Was he involved in something that he shouldn't have been?<eos> I'm not saying that.<eos> Well, then why was he hanging out with criminals?<eos> All right.<eos> He told me what happened.<eos> Your affair.<eos> If I'm honest, I think it did his fucking head in.<eos> Me screwing around, it doesn't explain, it doesn't explain why a man who's given his life to banging people up would suddenly turn bent.<eos> He wasn't bent.<eos> How do you know?
Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Get in the car.<eos> You know, legally speaking, that's trespassing.<eos> Adam's here.<eos> You are joking?<eos> He wanted to see you.<eos> You let him in? !<eos> Look, when Paul was alive things were different.<eos> But he might be the father of your baby and you might need him in your life, so...
I won't.<eos> - I'll see you later.<eos> - See you later.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - Love you too.<eos> We need to talk about this.<eos> About what?<eos> What, the fact that I had sex with you when I was perfectly happy in my relationship?<eos> But you weren't happy, were you?<eos> You wanted something different.
Every time I do, it just... .. just reminds me he's dead.<eos> I was... going to ask if I could help carry him, carry the coffin.<eos> You've probably got friends who can do it, but...<eos> No it'll be, erm...<eos> It'll be coppers.<eos> Erm, honour guard, in dress uniform.<eos> It's Paul's mum, she wants the whole ceremonial bit.<eos> She sent me an e-mail, very strongly worded one.<eos> She wants, like, 26 gun salute, and trumpets, and... all that bullshit.<eos> Did you like him?
No it'll be, erm...<eos> It'll be coppers.<eos> Erm, honour guard, in dress uniform.<eos> It's Paul's mum, she wants the whole ceremonial bit.<eos> She sent me an e-mail, very strongly worded one.<eos> She wants, like, 26 gun salute, and trumpets, and... all that bullshit.<eos> Did you like him?<eos> Paul?<eos> And don't... don't just say yes cos he's dead.<eos> Did you really like him?
Like what?<eos> There's this guy called Kevin Sherwood.<eos> Extremely dodgy businessman -- he's got links to credit and debit card scams and money laundering, and illegal machinery sales in Nigeria.<eos> He said Paul was helping him, that they had a deal.<eos> And you believe him?<eos> I don't want to, but...<eos> God, you know what they say, you know - if it smells like shit and it looks like shit...<eos> - Helen.<eos> You look like shit.<eos> And you're going to need all your strength to get through this funeral and, to be frank, the last thing you need is to be looking at his coffin and wondering if he was corrupt.
Well, there you go.<eos> You reap what you sow.<eos> Isn't that right, Clyde?<eos> You reap what you sow.<eos> If there's anything you need...<eos> - Hi.<eos> - You all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Helen, can I, erm, say something, as a friend? - Mm-hm.<eos> If you ever need anything, please, for once in your life, just pick up the bloody phone.
- You OK?<eos> - How's the investigation going?<eos> - Well, I spoke with Carter, but it can wait until...<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> This is his funeral.<eos> We are surrounded by coppers.<eos> - This is the perfect time.<eos> - Gary, can you give us a minute?<eos> Yeah, yeah, course. Yeah.<eos> - I was going to come see you tomorrow.
Well, it's just a thought, but maybe he was with him.<eos> Remember the witness evidence?<eos> Saying that Paul spoke to another man?<eos> We never traced him.<eos> Adam lured Paul out under a pretext.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The baby.<eos> So we understand each other, yeah?<eos> Yeah, we're good.<eos> You need some time to work things out.
Hey! Don't sass!<eos> Have you seen her?<eos> Therapist girl?<eos> I love her. I'm certain.<eos> Hey, sweetheart.<eos> Everything is cool.<eos> Um, one good thing.<eos> Um, I made a new friend at this job.<eos> It's a guy named Dennis. Somebody shot him. Hey, there's--<eos> There's something I've been meaning to tell you, and it's kind of hard to say.
It's just- - A dumb pen.<eos> You brought it. Hmm. There's a woman in Europe.<eos> She's investigating this thing-- this incident that John's connected to.<eos> She's gotten footing.<eos> Nothing meaningful, but footing.<eos> And, Alice, she cannot connect the person that John's positioned as right now to John Tavner.<eos> And she cannot connect him to you.<eos> It means his freedom.<eos> Something happened, and it means his freedom.<eos> He called you, I know, from this place on this night.
No, I didn't, Tom.<eos> But John did.<eos> For the first time.<eos> We have this principle we use when we're trying to locate someone who doesn't want to be discovered.<eos> You are what you can't stop doing.<eos> What that means... If we discover what someone is passionate about, then that person and that thing will intersect.<eos> Passion involves compulsion.<eos> And people-- All people have compulsions that draw them away from their safety and their best interests. People and what they love don't always intersect.<eos> People and their compulsions do.<eos> And John, well, he's compelled toward you.
There's a threat.<eos> If there's no threat, they'll just keep asking for the red bag, or they'll go to the detective and fuck everything up.<eos> All right. Don't get defensive.<eos> It's just a little weird, putting a guy in a bag.<eos> - You know--<eos> - What?<eos> That's not a fair technique in an argument to call someone defensive.<eos> It's a great technique, because they can't argue with you after that.<eos> They have to stop arguing or they'll sound defensive.<eos> Just make sure you get him to Edward that morning, because you have to get to the bagman straight away.
- Hey, man.<eos> - This is my friend Dennis.<eos> It's okay.<eos> He knows a bunch of shit he shouldn't know.<eos> I had to borrow his pee.<eos> Never mind.<eos> Hey, can someone take this bag?<eos> - Oh. - Oh, yeah.<eos> Let's get in there.<eos> You got a plate presentation to make.
I know where he is.<eos> We pay $5,000 per unit.<eos> However, if you're willing to give more than 10%, purchase price doubles.<eos> Payment is made in full on the day of removal.<eos> There's also a standard confidentiality clause.<eos> That's detailed on page seven of the release.<eos> Do you have any questions?<eos> Yes.<eos> Will it... hurt?<eos> I told you.
You're forgiven.<eos> So...<eos> What're we doin' today?<eos> I've heard there's this place in the Quarter where they shoot ya in the chest for money.<eos> I think that might be fun.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You wear a vest and that.<eos> It's a game.<eos> Where they pay you to get shot in the chest?
It's always good to give a girl a good helping' whenever you can.<eos> Just like they do in the shows and that.<eos> I couldn't agree with you more.<eos> What are you talkin' about?<eos> Talking about zooming' in on the gun to find out who shot at you.<eos> Just zoom in...<eos> Okay, seriously.<eos> What the hell happened with you and this girl?<eos> I didn't marry her, Tulip.<eos> I'll tell you that much.
Terrorist attacks and comedians.<eos> I love reality TV...<eos> You know, like, idjits just ridin' 'round the world on motorcycles and fat women competing' for prizes.<eos> So basically, you watch trash TV.<eos> I do not just basically watch trash TV at all.<eos> It's really an in-depth survey on the human experience, all right?<eos> Watchin' those fat ladies transform into beautiful things, wonderful things.<eos> Then they finally learn to love themselves.<eos> And sometimes the producers even pay to get rid of their stretch marks.<eos> You really oughta try watchin' it.
You don't know shit.<eos> Kill me then.<eos> See what happens.<eos> That's the idea.<eos> Or see what doesn't happen.<eos> The old man doesn't matter now.<eos> Let him go.<eos> Talk quick before I lose this bullet in your skull.<eos> You think you're workin' for God, don't you?<eos> Kill the Preacher, and God will give you what you want.

I can send a man to Hell if I want.<eos> Look! I've done it before.<eos> I can send you to Heaven.<eos> You know what I'm saying? Do you know what it takes to get me to heaven?<eos> What I need?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you can get that?<eos> Where?<eos> Hm. Nice try.<eos> You're going to have to trust me.
Drop it.<eos> Disarm.<eos> The gun.<eos> Saber.<eos> A cop-killin', child-murderin' son of a bitch tryin' to make his way through the pearly gates?<eos> You really think there's a place for you in Heaven?<eos> Up there with your wife and child?<eos> Livin' in peace for all eternity?<eos> No.<eos> I'll tell you where you belong.
Denis?<eos> Would you just do th... Do the remote for me?<eos> Fingers are still growin' in.<eos> All right, so... check it out.<eos> DVD, Blu-ray.<eos> Got a PlayStation.<eos> Denis?<eos> See?<eos> PlayStation. "Rocket Five."<eos> That's for you, Tulip.

Previously on Cardinal...<eos> They found a body.<eos> It's not my department anymore.<eos> It's a child.<eos> They think it might be her.<eos> We're gonna throw everything we have at this, Dorothy.<eos> You said that before.<eos> Then you gave up.<eos> If I make you the lead on this, I need to know that you're not gonna drift.
Why so much this time?<eos> I mean, there's a rumour our department's under investigation.<eos> It's gotta be a dirty cop or we'd handle it internally.<eos> You'll know the name Kyle Corbett, controls the bulk of the drug trade north of Toronto.<eos> Someone from our side is feeding Corbett information.<eos> Find the link between Cardinal and Corbett.<eos> Listen, we don't know Cardinal's done anything wrong.<eos> That's right.<eos> If he's dirty,<eos> I'm not getting in your way but right now, this nightmare... whatever else Musgrave has you doing, this is your priority.
Listen, we don't know Cardinal's done anything wrong.<eos> That's right.<eos> If he's dirty,<eos> I'm not getting in your way but right now, this nightmare... whatever else Musgrave has you doing, this is your priority.<eos> Clear?<eos> I need to go to Toronto for the autopsy.<eos> I'll come with you.<eos> It's not necessary.<eos> You've been up all night.<eos> You could use a co-pilot.
All the cousins.<eos> I know.<eos> Sugar shack, sing-alongs, mulled wine.<eos> We don't drink mulled wine.<eos> So what do I tell her?<eos> Tell her someone's murdering children.<eos> It's my job to stop them.<eos> Busy at work.<eos> I'll let her know.<eos> Since when do you want to see my family?
We don't drink mulled wine.<eos> So what do I tell her?<eos> Tell her someone's murdering children.<eos> It's my job to stop them.<eos> Busy at work.<eos> I'll let her know.<eos> Since when do you want to see my family?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's been a while.<eos> It might do you some good.
She wanted to stay.<eos> You didn't?<eos> Algonquin Bay's my home.<eos> Yeah but I mean you spent, what, ten years over there.<eos> Decorated big city detective.<eos> That's a lot to leave behind.<eos> It was easy.<eos> What does your wife do?<eos> Hey. If you don't want to talk, suits me.<eos> Or I could tell you what day Katie Pine was killed.
Really?<eos> Let me see. Let me see.<eos> Happy?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Seriously.<eos> You hungry?<eos> Yeah.<eos> When do you think she'll get out?<eos> Soon.<eos> You don't, you don't need to worry about that.
Kelly, this is Delorme.<eos> - Lise.<eos> - Lise. Nice to meet you.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey, you should start running again.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause you like it.
No. That, that comes from above.<eos> Nice meeting you, John.<eos> And you.<eos> I noticed him when I was cooking dinner.<eos> Didn't think much of it but then I looked half an hour later, he was still standing here.<eos> Where exactly?<eos> Right there.<eos> Right about there.<eos> That's when I realized he was staring into Dorothy's window.<eos> I didn't want to worry her with it but I thought with everything I should call you.
Cardinal is waiting for me.<eos> Good, you can, I don't know, talk to him.<eos> Make him your pal, Delorme.<eos> Open him.<eos> - Do you understand? - Hey.<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you understand how big this is?<eos> I do.<eos> Look, if this goes well,<eos> it's gonna be good for you.
You make enemies in this job.<eos> You don't want anything on your car might catch somebody's eye.<eos> Do you mean that?<eos> My whole league has those.<eos> You see them everywhere.<eos> Why'd you leave Financial Crimes?<eos> You never did tell me.<eos> Just grew out of it.<eos> You won't see much of your team this season.<eos> You're gonna have to clear your calendar.
Stupid question.<eos> He's not interested, mutt.<eos> Hey dude, come on.<eos> You are interested?<eos> My mistake.<eos> What is that on your face?<eos> Is that some kind of burn?<eos> Hey man, mind your own business.<eos> All right.<eos> You're awfully concerned about her man, maybe you should be more worried about yourself.
Have a good night.<eos> Can I ask you a favour?<eos> I don't want to be here anymore.<eos> Could you walk me home?<eos> I don't feel safe with that guy out there.<eos> I-I just...<eos> My place isn't far.<eos> I just ordered this drink.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I could call you a cab if you want.
If you're going to All Flesh, you should avoid the chicken.<eos> I read they've got crazy levels of dioxin.<eos> I'm going to Loaves and Fishes.<eos> Then you should definitely avoid the tuna.<eos> Mercury?<eos> No, I just don't like tuna very much.<eos> Maybe he's lonely.<eos> Maybe he watches me.<eos> Maybe he's an Eye.<eos> Peace be with you.
Hello?<eos> Good morning.<eos> Janine?<eos> I'll be your server this morning.<eos> Can I get you some coffee to start?<eos> Put your clothes on, dummy.<eos> Aunt Beth is on bed check.<eos> I don't want extra prayers on account of you.<eos> Alma, go to bed, don't make this a thing.<eos> You're having a dream, okay? Wake up.
As they used to say.<eos> It was nice to finally meet you.<eos> You too.<eos> There's an Eye in your house.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Blessed be the fruit.<eos> Gentlemen?<eos> Please, let's continue in my office.<eos> No rest for the weary.<eos> We'll join you for dinner.
Now, the Guardians of the Faithful and American soldiers still fight with tanks in the remains of Chicago.<eos> Now, Anchorage is the capital of what's left of the United States, and the flag that flies over that city has only two stars.<eos> Now, darkness and secrets are everywhere.<eos> Now, there has to be an "us."<eos> Because, now, there is a "them."<eos> Get caught in the rain?<eos> Yes.<eos> You were gone a while.<eos> Sometimes we walk home along by the river.<eos> You need to be careful.
Thank you for trying.<eos> No worries.<eos> He probably just wants a blowjob.<eos> What did he say?<eos> When he asked to see you alone?<eos> He didn't.<eos> He sent his driver, Nick.<eos> Be careful.<eos> A lot of the drivers work for the Eyes.<eos> He said I shouldn't trust you.
It's like a treasure hunt.<eos> "The first thing you have to do is take your bike to black-eyed Sue."<eos> I don't think my grandma will let me do that.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll take care of her.<eos> Oh. I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't...<eos> Who's your friend, Henry?<eos> I'm Minx.<eos> - Pleasure to meet you.
I managed to escape thanks to Dr. Gallinger.<eos> And your time with him has cured you?<eos> I'm here because I'm well again.<eos> I haven't taken any cocaine for some time and the heroin drug that they treated me with is completely gone from my system.<eos> He's back.<eos> What?<eos> Where?<eos> I need to be busy again, to work, and I am confident in my ability to do so.<eos> Well, I for one am not.<eos> Nor am I. You'll have to be monitored.
But the two who drag me into serious malfeasance are a society lady and a fucking nun.<eos> How is Harry doing?<eos> You ever been inside of a jailhouse?<eos> Well, it ain't exactly the Waldorf.<eos> After a while, those walls, they start whispering at you, telling you you ain't never gonna get out.<eos> I've known a few tough lads turn to jelly after a while in a place like that.<eos> Now, Harry, she's tougher than all of them.<eos> But not for much longer.<eos> She's starting to go.<eos> She's lucky to have you.
What about...<eos> "My Wild Irish Rose"?<eos> Yeah, no.<eos> No, that voice is just making the thing retreat and look for cover.<eos> Oh! That's working for me, though!<eos> Do that again!<eos> On to new business.<eos> The Search Committee has been tireless in its quest to identify a builder to finish construction on the new hospital without further delay or unanticipated expense.<eos> After careful consideration, we are pleased to nominate for the job Mr. Raphael Warren of the firm Tate, Warren, and Bond.<eos> His CV is in front of you, but I think you're already acquainted with his work, especially the lavish hotels he's built in midtown for Colonel Astor.
Your umbilicus.<eos> And this?<eos> Your pelvis.<eos> Iliac crest to be exact.<eos> And this?<eos> And this?<eos> That's my...<eos> It certainly is.<eos> I don't think this is your first time.<eos> It is with you.
Take a pinch of this at the first sign of any symptoms.<eos> It's quinine.<eos> Oh, now all I need do is lay in a stock of gin and limes and I can make a party of it.<eos> Worry about your other patients, John.<eos> I'll look in on you later.<eos> One second.<eos> Yes?<eos> In the last century, neurologists have revolutionized our understanding of the human brain.<eos> Using electric currents, they discovered that precise points of the brain can be stimulated to reveal their specific functions.<eos> Seated in front of you is Mr. Sidney Carton.
So I kept on.<eos> In the end, his spleen, colon, and testicles, they all came out.<eos> Dear God.<eos> I realize it may seem extreme, but I'm happy to report the young man is now home, he's found employment, no longer struggles with his symptoms.<eos> He is leading a relatively normal life. And five years ago, that would have been impossible.<eos> Normal life?<eos> That young man isn't a hypochondriac anymore 'cause there's nothing left of him to be hypochondriacal about.<eos> I don't understand why a doctor would shrink so timidly from the frontiers of science.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Are you all right?
He was an explorer.<eos> You're not onstage.<eos> It's just us.<eos> Where are you from originally?<eos> We were both born in Minsk.<eos> Well, if only one of you were born in Minsk, that would be a miracle.<eos> Our father didn't want us and sold us to circus when we were babies.<eos> We went from one to the next.<eos> Prague, Bologna, Marseilles, then Blackpool where Mr. Brockhurst bought and bring us here.<eos> How does he treat you?
Please!<eos> - He has chest pains.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Are you his wife?<eos> - No, I'm his- - I'm his sister.<eos> - His name's John Rayburn.<eos> - What happened?<eos> He called me.<eos> He couldn't speak, could barely breathe.<eos> Okay, the doctor's gonna wanna talk to you.
- When can I see him?<eos> - There are forms that need to be filled.<eos> - We asked your daughter, but she left.<eos> - My daughter was here?<eos> She brought Mr. Rayburn in.<eos> Why did she leave?<eos> - I'm not sure.<eos> - What about John's wife?<eos> We didn't have that information.<eos> That's why we contacted you.
I don't want to argue with my beautiful, lovely, wonderful daughter.<eos> I'm just trying to have conversation.<eos> - Sweetie--<eos> - Dad.<eos> Who's that?<eos> - Are you John?<eos> - Can I help you?<eos> Danny Rayburn was your brother, right?<eos> That's right.<eos> I need to talk to you.
Detectives found some stuff in the house, some... some photos of kids.<eos> - Pornographic?<eos> - Not at all.<eos> They also found some boys' stuff...<eos> Baseball mitts and a bike.<eos> Was he cooperative?<eos> Offered to take a polygraph.<eos> And where are wen identifying the victim?<eos> We're cross-referencing the leads from the tip line with hospital record sand missing persons.<eos> Chief, uh, can I speak to you about Captain Pounds?
Hmm... - Hmm. - Hmm.<eos> Yeah. But now I'm spreading gossip, and I really shouldn't do that.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm not gonna do that.<eos> Your daughter's life is in grave danger.<eos> It's just another lie to get her to talk.<eos> And what's the harm in that?<eos> If none of you have done anything wrong, like you keep on insisting...<eos> And our lawyer already told us, no matter what you said... We're not even supposed to be talking to you without him here.
I've never told anyone.<eos> It was a long time ago, way before we met.<eos> What?<eos> I'm Daisy.<eos> I'm the girl Brandon James was obsessed with.<eos> Okay.<eos> I was a minor, so my dad kept my name out of the police reports.<eos> And only my family called me Daisy.<eos> What about Emma's dad?<eos> You said that things ended badly between you two.
Fuck off!<eos> Consider that leaked.<eos> ~ Take a bow, lady, take a bow.<eos> ~ Oh!<eos> No, no, no, no, no, these are on me.<eos> Oh, thanks, ma'am.<eos> Oh, do I pick them, or do I pick them?<eos> Oh, you are not still sulking about that call<eos> I made to your old man, are you?<eos> It was a joke... and what's going on between you two, anyway?
They can bring each other comfort.<eos> We'll get out of here.<eos> All right?<eos> You think he means to kill the King?<eos> But whatever he wants, he's been planning this for a long time.<eos> Can you move?<eos> Argh! Stop!<eos> ~ It's no good.<eos> ~ Can't you Musketeers do anything useful?<eos> Of all the people in all the world, I've got to be chained to you!
We should have died, but we didn't.<eos> We were kept alive for a purpose.<eos> Gerberoy is gone but we shall see it is never forgotten.<eos> ~ I heard you broke a window.<eos> ~ Better that than my neck.<eos> Athos.<eos> Oh, Your Majesty.<eos> Thank God you're safe.<eos> It's good to see you, Captain.<eos> God was watching over you, Your Majesty.
~ Why?<eos> ~ It was my choice, Brother.<eos> ~ There's two.<eos> ~ Right.<eos> You two take this corridor, we'll take the lower.<eos> ~ Attack on my command.<eos> ~ Yes, Captain.<eos> Stay here... you'll be safe.<eos> You almost sound as though you care.<eos> I'm coming with you.
~ Is Alpha?<eos> Really badly.<eos> ~ All right.<eos> Are you where I left you?<eos> ~ He's dying.<eos> He needs me.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Cathy, answer me.<eos> Are you where I last saw you?<eos> Is Alpha with you?
May I speak with your father?<eos> You may think me presumptuous but my attachment is sincere.<eos> I would not wish to proceed without his approval.<eos> Forgive me, I must speak with my cousin.<eos> My dear, I believe Francis is looking for you.<eos> ~ People love to gossip.<eos> ~ Isn't that why they come to such evenings?<eos> But to give them cause?<eos> To make your attentions so pronounced?<eos> Whatever was between you, trust me, she has put it behind her.
Despite our conversation?<eos> Exploring the idea.<eos> Stubborn.<eos> Rash.<eos> ~ Won't take no for an answer.<eos> ~ Well...<eos> The curse of the Poldarks.<eos> And our salvation!<eos> I salute you, boy.<eos> Take Francis with you.
I do know me place.<eos> Your place is where I say it is.<eos> Fetch your cloak.<eos> Sir?<eos> Never 'ad no cloak.<eos> This is an important day for us both.<eos> Let's see who can strike the better bargain.<eos> Verity!<eos> Oh, Ross.<eos> ~ Is Francis with you?
Don't try.<eos> You love Francis, I love Francis.<eos> But this cannot be allowed to continue!<eos> Out.<eos> Damn me, if a man can't get about 'is sacred an' profane duties<eos> ~ wi'out a blasting' from...<eos> ~ Out!<eos> You must speak with Francis.<eos> And your uncle, you must speak with both of them.<eos> I'll follow you directly.
As folk with hurts and feelings, same as they.<eos> Sometimes I fail to see that, too, Demelza.<eos> Sometimes I barely see what's right in front of me.<eos> He's just a lad, sir.<eos> They mun' sure let him go.<eos> You would think so.<eos> Is Jinny ready?<eos> She can't go, Ross. 'Tis 'er time.<eos> Bring him safe home, Ross.<eos> Has been unemployed by you' in soliciting that pardon from the Almighty which I trust your prayers may obtain through the merits of your redeemer, whose first attribute is mercy.
~ And the power of luck beside.<eos> ~ We'll need a rise in the price of ore.<eos> Else we're all wasting' our time.<eos> ~ This shareholders meeting'...<eos> ~ Not a prospect I relish.<eos> We're no closer to copper, so I must appeal for further investment if we're to keep blasting.<eos> But - are they not friends o' yourn?<eos> If ever they were, they're reconsidering the connection.<eos> I would that I had nothing better to do than admire the view!<eos> They'd happily swap places with you, sir.
~ You must be relieved.<eos> ~ How?<eos> You're not the only one to disgrace the family<eos> ~ by an unsuitable attachment.<eos> ~ Francis!<eos> Consider yourself fortunate.<eos> See what you've missed.<eos> ~ Dr Choake. ~ Mm?<eos> Mm.<eos> I've puzzled you out.
No, you didn't.<eos> Gay boys always date asians in high school, before they find themselves and start breaking hearts.<eos> You do know we're lawyers, don't you?<eos> Asians and fatties... or both.<eos> You know... big asians.<eos> How much did you weigh when you were 16, like 170, 180?<eos> I need to ask you to leave.<eos> Sore spot, huh?<eos> You know if you don't talk to one of us here, we'll have to ask you to accompany us downtown.<eos> Pastor Almond, we'll speak with you, but he has to go wait in the car.
Am I gonna die?<eos> Chest pain, racing heart, a feeling of impending doom... what you are experiencing is called a panic attack.<eos> The body makes a decision.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I beg of you, Backstrom, change your ways, reform.<eos> Start with telling the truth about what happened when you shot Visser.<eos> Hey.<eos> You can't talk about that.<eos> That's violating patient confidentiality.<eos> I can talk about it to you as your doctor.
You look amazing.<eos> Are you sleeping with somebody?<eos> Harrison, we are separated.<eos> That's none of your business.<eos> Nate, I will talk to you later.<eos> Happy birthday!<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, yeah, look at the way she's walking.<eos> She's definitely getting the high hard one.<eos> What is wrong with the two of you?
We may have feelings for each other, but we could never be truly happy if our happiness cost you yours.<eos> Which is why I hereby swear that I will never lay another hand on your mom.<eos> Unless she's falling.<eos> Or she has an open wound, and I have to apply pressure.<eos> Or high fives.<eos> I can't rule out high fives.<eos> Jimmy, okay, I-I appreciate what you're trying and failing to say.<eos> And mom, I-I'm sorry that I turned this whole thing into a Nate-Of-Emergency.<eos> I do want you to be happy.<eos> And yeah, this whole thing weirds the hell out of me, but whatever may or may not happen with you is up to you.
Okay.<eos> Just listen. Everybody just fucking listen.<eos> I'm through trying to be a nice guy. Okay?<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm not a nice person, but I'm good at what I fucking do.<eos> I'm really, really good at it.<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> That's why I went out there and got all you guys, right?<eos> All your companies so that we could, together, be one bigger, better company.<eos> 'Cause I know, with you, we can fucking crush it out there.
You know that's not true, don't you, Minx?<eos> You know that Drill is real.<eos> He asked you to play a game, didn't he?<eos> What did he ask you to do?<eos> You're just trying to confuse me.<eos> I just need the truth, Minx.<eos> Tell me about this game.<eos> We played lots of games, but not anymore.<eos> I stopped talking to him, and he got mad.<eos> Maybe if I stop talking to you, you'll go away, too.

I hate you.
In there.<eos> Hey. Front-door-only access, reinforced walls... not the easiest place to recon...<eos> You wanna make some sketches?<eos> Look, you have your specialties, I have mine.<eos> Breaching a fortified position with opposed entry takes a little finesse.<eos> Scavenger!<eos> Cheeky!<eos> This ought to be interesting.<eos> Keep your hands where I can see 'em, ma'am.<eos> We're not here for you.
Nadia, listen to me, it's not safe here for you right now.<eos> You need to come with me.<eos> This is your fault, isn't it?<eos> You screw up and then they come after your family?<eos> She seems pretty smart.<eos> Too bad you're not.<eos> We knew you'd come back.<eos> Where's my brother?<eos> Why don't you come with me and ask El Jefe yourself.<eos> All right, you let her go... and I'm gonna come with you.
Don't look at him.<eos> That's how he got me.<eos> Good, you're awake.<eos> - What happened?<eos> Where am I?<eos> - You were in an accident.<eos> Lucky to be alive. The other officers who brought you in last night said we should give you special attention, said you're a hero.
I would love to get to know the real you.<eos> That's exactly what I'm talking about.<eos> Um... You know, this...<eos> - Look, Daniela...<eos> - Whoa.<eos> You saying this, it makes me feel...<eos> I mean, it's...<eos> It's kind of uncomfortable.<eos> Lito.<eos> Because you're being honest with me, I... I want to be honest with you.
"They had words."<eos> In a movie, that would mean someone is in the hospital.<eos> This isn't a movie, Lito.<eos> So, you said Joaquin was a friend of your family.<eos> He worked for my father for a long time.<eos> What does your father do?<eos> Import/export.<eos> What does he import/export?<eos> Stuff people want, I guess.<eos> How serious was this thing between you and Joaquin?
How serious was this thing between you and Joaquin?<eos> It started my last year at university in San Diego.<eos> He'd call me every time he was in town, and at first, it was fun, casual.<eos> But then he got serious, and...<eos> My turn.<eos> So, how did you pick me to be your beard?<eos> My agent showed me your head shot.<eos> Aw!<eos> You liked my head shot?<eos> It was between you and Gloria Sanchez.
I thought I could circulate it, an effort to trigger someone...<eos> Anyone else's memory.<eos> They'd see the cover, a hint of memory...<eos> They pick up the book, read it.<eos> The suppressed memories surface, and they'd find their way to me to discover more.<eos> Just like you did.<eos> Did it work with anyone else?<eos> You didn't see it on The New York Times best seller list, did you?<eos> So all we have to do is read the book?<eos> If you've seen them, if they've done something to you, then the book will help you remember.
If you only knew what was to come.<eos> And what does that mean?<eos> Mr. Palmer, sir.<eos> I'm Coco Marchand.<eos> I work with Jack Parker.<eos> I'm, I'm sorry I'm late, it was challenging to get here.<eos> Where's Mr. Parker?<eos> With all the craziness, he had a family emergency.<eos> But I'm a licensed broker, and I know, from working with Mr. Parker, how important this deal is.<eos> So, I jumped at the chance to work with you.
Detective Wilson.<eos> We appreciate all the information that you've given us.<eos> But the truth is, cop or no cop, you should've never had the authority to oversee the abduction of your own daughter.<eos> Which is why you're no longer on the case.<eos> You don't have the authority to do that.<eos> Actually, I do.<eos> And you can bitch and moan about it all your want.<eos> But it's not gonna do any good, so...<eos> What I would like you to do is go home.<eos> And let us know if Carter or Lori Stevens tries to contact you.
- Hi.<eos> Your mom and I wanted to talk to you guys about this egg donor business.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I guess what I wanted to say was, no matter what we found out about our biology, that the time that I had you, um...<eos> When you were babies...<eos> It doesn't change anything.<eos> What she said, if that's what you're worried about.<eos> Well, we thought we should talk about it.<eos> You mean the fact that you never told us?<eos> Or me even though I was with you the whole time?
Or that one?<eos> We're in chinatown.<eos> There's red doors everywhere.<eos> [ shouting in chinese ]<eos> Here.<eos> They're perfectly good noodles.<eos> [ speaking chinese ] noodles!<eos> [ shouts in chinese ]<eos> Well, lieutenant, two worlds collided just like she said. Gravely:<eos> And look behind you. Red door.
But I can't-<eos> - See, I don't have 90 days.<eos> Well, it is policy.<eos> I need to review the damage.<eos> There's no damage, I told you.<eos> They broke a window.<eos> That's it.<eos> Can you show me?<eos> Okay, listen.<eos> I'm just gonna be totally frank with you, okay?
- I can't sign off on the loan as it is.<eos> - I can't.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> - I've gotta be able to talk to somebody.<eos> - I'm so sorry, Mr. Rayburn.<eos> - Fuck.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> Thanks, Debbie!<eos> Pleasure doing business with you, Deb!
Let that be a lesson to you.<eos> What'd you guys even do?<eos> We had some fun.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good night, Janey.<eos> Sleep tight, Janey.<eos> Good night.<eos> Shit.<eos> Sorry you have to sleep next to that tonight.<eos> What happened with you guys?
- Excuse me?<eos> - You scream at him... act like you're right and he's wrong, but you're the one who had an affair.<eos> - There's a lot you don't know.<eos> - You brought that cop home.<eos> I know you took his side against Daddy.<eos> Please, don't come up with me.<eos> You're volunteering at the bookstore as an excuse to hover, and it's creepy.<eos> Ray Donovan?<eos> You know who this is?<eos> Mr. Finney wants to meet you.
I see.<eos> Is it true that thing's 50...? Oh... Fifty-five...<eos> That's a hell of a grill, man.<eos> Gary?<eos> Gary?<eos> You fell asleep.<eos> You got Mickey Donovan.<eos> There's a doctor in the kitchen.<eos> Get the...<eos> Mr. Finney wants to speak with you.
I don't believe you did write this book for the medical community.<eos> I find it curious a writer from the American Medical Journal would take issue with a text designed for practising physicians.<eos> I think this is a Trojan horse.<eos> I think you have bigger plans for this work.<eos> I think you've released this material to piggyback on the so-called Sexual Revolution...<eos> A 12-year study does not piggyback, Mr Buckland.<eos> We have built on the sociological work of Alfred Kinsey, that is true, but our work has far superseded that.<eos> What Mrs Johnson means is that our work is based on empirical evidence.<eos> Our study is in fact unprecedented.<eos> As you can see from the data before you.
- Hello.<eos> - Hello.<eos> I shouldn't have to chase you into town to meet your friends, Henry.<eos> They're welcome at the house.<eos> Well, in fact, we are just shopping for dinner now.<eos> Tina, would you like to join us?<eos> That's so nice of you, but I really can't.<eos> My little one's waiting for me at home, and he gets anxious if I'm gone too long.<eos> Of course he does.<eos> - Anyway, so nice to meet you both.
I'm going all the way to...<eos> What the hell's that?<eos> Something on the tracks?<eos> Shit.<eos> We gotta stop!<eos> Eldritch, you have crossed a line that cannot be uncrossed.<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you really believe that I am a man to be trifled with?<eos> Who are you to give orders?<eos> Eldritch's pact isn't with you.
And you want to talk about whether she was raped,<eos> - whether she wasn't raped.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - Why? What difference does it make?<eos> - Because that is not<eos> - the child that I raised...<eos> - Don't do it!<eos> Don't do it to her!<eos> Don't!<eos> Your son doesn't even want to visit with you. How are you going to help him if he doesn't want to talk to you?
You done blaming each other?<eos> Yeah, I gambled.<eos> That's got nothing to do with my son getting killed.<eos> Matt and Gwen deserve better than what happened to them, and they deserve better than what we're doing right here.<eos> Gwen's gonna survive, and she's gonna need you every day.<eos> Maybe it's for the best.<eos> At least that way she won't be able to... around.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> You can drag down your daughter if you want.<eos> But I know my child was a good child, and I'm not about to sit around and fight with you all while the animal who shot him walks.
Crafty mom thing getting to you, partner?<eos> I'm making a snowman ring toss out of empty bottles.<eos> I need two more.<eos> Drink.<eos> Frosty the Snowman never looked so creepy.<eos> Don't bash my snowman.<eos> He and I are very fragile right now.<eos> Personal issues.<eos> Heard you weren't exactly on team Angela.<eos> What is it with all you gossipy men?
- (GIGGLES) You're gonna call on it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, maybe it's cheaper than we think.<eos> - Maybe it's haunted.<eos> - Maybe it's on an Indian burial ground.<eos> - No.<eos> Oh, shit, maybe it's on Oscar Newman's list of alternate sites for public housing units.<eos> Ma, we ain't taking no.<eos> Now, this is what they call an "intervention."<eos> So, I'm 47 years old, raised both of you out of diapers and piss pants, and now you intervening in my life?
Gracias.<eos> Anita, it's Carmen.<eos> Fefipe?<eos> Emergency Financial Control Board of Yonkers is now in session.<eos> In light of the pending fines proposed by the US District Court, the resolution before the board is to freeze all hiring and discretionary spending by the City of Yonkers.<eos> Madam Chair, if I may?<eos> Instead of tying the city's purse strings, how about the board ask Governor Cuomo to step in and do something about it?<eos> Mr. DeLuca, this is the City of Yonkers' problem.<eos> "You have a responsibility to yourself and to your city's future<eos> "to express your reasoned concern to the four people you elected "who have brought you to this precipice.
Come on, Nicky, what's it gonna take for you?<eos> Huh?<eos> Pete, what about you?<eos> Look, I can't vote for this as it stands now, right?<eos> There's got to be some room for negotiation.<eos> Negotiation with who, Judge Sand?<eos> Nicky, get a grip- Our backs are to the wall here.<eos> Hank was never gonna vote for any plan, anyway.<eos> We're better off without him here.<eos> Yeah, Fagan neither. It comes down to you two guys.
Yeah, well, you know how these campaigns go. We're always running somewhere.<eos> Speaking of which, we're late for some radio we have to do.<eos> Oh, come on, Councilman.<eos> A couple questions and I'm out of your hair.<eos> Yeah? What would be the point?<eos> The point?<eos> It's an election. You're running.<eos> I'm covering it.<eos> Yeah, for The New York Times.<eos> See, if you were one of the Yonkers guys, I'd talk to you.
This is him bringing me in here. This is him finally making good on his promise to make me part of the administration.<eos> I can't fucking believe this.<eos> You're gonna try to fire my boss for no reason.<eos> Don't do this, Nick.<eos> Nay, it's about the bigger picture.<eos> If I throw in with Zaleski, I become the go-to guy on the council.<eos> I don't know, Nick.<eos> You don't know?<eos> I don't think it's a good idea.<eos> Christ Almighty, what's the matter with you people?
Wh-where you been?<eos> Oh, hey, Jack. Everything good? Nice to see you.<eos> We're making real progress knocking down the affordable housing part of the court order.<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> And the compromise plan the council approved fell apart the day before they were going to give it to Sand.<eos> Mary, we can stop the next 800 units.<eos> Jack, the thing is affordable housing is for people who can afford to rent. So it's not the same thing.<eos> It's the same.<eos> It drops down property values, it brings in the bad element.<eos> It's just I don't agree with you, okay?
They have a great success rate.<eos> Maybe I can get...<eos> More normal.<eos> Run for dog catcher.<eos> Is this your ball?<eos> M-may I throw it to you?<eos> Oh.<eos> That was one of the best catches I've seen, well, in all my years.<eos> I catch it all the time.<eos> I stand before you astonished and astounded.
Then--okay.<eos> Then throw some money at it, Abby.<eos> I'm at work right now.<eos> I got to--I got to go.<eos> Thank you, Becca.<eos> Jake was absolutely no help.<eos> So why would you call a comparative religions major for computer help?<eos> It's just habit.<eos> And then the field trip.<eos> I can go with you guys.
- Okay...<eos> But you keep flapping your gums, and the cops will be happy to stop by.<eos> Come on, now, the both of you, let's go.<eos> Please, just listen.<eos> Her name is Anne Moore.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Are you Annie's boy?<eos> Believe it or not, I was thinking of you when I called her.<eos> It was the right thing to do.<eos> Sure, it has nothing to do with you two finishing what you started now that my dad's out of the picture.
But I will never let you down, okay?<eos> Vocal Adrenaline has always been the team to topple, and today is no different, all right?<eos> So I want you to own this stage and dominate.<eos> Are you bipolar?<eos> Okay, show circle.<eos> That means...<eos> Okay.<eos> Um... it's kind of my thing.<eos> We all just get in there and just...<eos> We don't like you.
If he is lying, maybe he's doing it for a good reason?<eos> Some kind of nice surprise?<eos> Yeah... no.<eos> He's about to do something stupid.<eos> _<eos> Alright, listen up, bitch.<eos> Our circuit takes us up and down the J star cluster.<eos> When you are done working off your fare, we can drop you off at any one of the colonies along our route.<eos> Until then, we own you.<eos> Every fight you win goes towards paying down your fare.
It's Christy.<eos> Whatever happened to Kelly, that one you used to run with?<eos> Always liked that one.<eos> I'd rather pass a gallstone than believe any of that trash they're saying about you on TV.<eos> What did I do now?<eos> !<eos> You have a visitor.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Best stand back.<eos> What's going on with you two?
About a year ago, hired his sister's kid, some pothead, to work for him.<eos> The kid did a crap job.<eos> His faulty wiring set three houses on fire.<eos> Joe's been working, at cost, to repair the houses.<eos> That's why he got nervous when we mentioned the fire.<eos> And you've confirmed this with his clients?<eos> They did have unusually low repair bills.<eos> He says he didn't say anything earlier because he assumed that he had caused your fire, and he didn't think he could afford to fix another house for free.<eos> Two crimes solved, but neither of them mine.<eos> Can I speak with you alone, please?
We're going after them. Buddy, I don't think...<eos> We're losing them!<eos> Don't do it, Alex.<eos> They just dusted 50 of our friends.<eos> Well, let's not make it 55.<eos> Alex, I'm telling you to go after that ship.<eos> What if they don't like being followed?<eos> They slip off that screen, they're gone forever.<eos> They'll get away with this.<eos> What is wrong with you?
Alex, send me some juice to E-12.<eos> Alex!<eos> Oh.<eos> E-12.<eos> Copy that.<eos> There you go, sugar.<eos> You doin' okay up there?<eos> I'm doing as good as dew on a mornin' full of sunshine.<eos> Hey, what's the deal with you and Naomi?<eos> You two an item or something?
Yes?<eos> I...<eos> Was... Lavon: Hey.<eos> George. Annabeth.<eos> I was just gonna grab me some coffee.<eos> Kind of blocking the door.<eos> Right. Oh. Right, i should...<eos> Uh... It was good to see you, a.B.<eos> Yes.<eos> You, too. Both! Of you.
No, i know you're right, and you have been<eos> Such a great friend to me, gloria. I... I shouldn't have let you down like that.<eos> Excuse me, i need to mingle.<eos> Oh! I hope i'm not interrupting.<eos> Oh! Dr. Hart.<eos> Crashing yet another breeland family event.<eos> Or are you just here for the roast?<eos> I-i am hungry.<eos> Uh, b-but, um, there's a problem with a patient.<eos> And, um, brick, i really need to consult with you.
He let you know him.<eos> He sent you his heart.<eos> Where has he gone now?<eos> He hasn't gone anywhere.<eos> He's still here.<eos> Hannibal.<eos> Signor Graham...<eos> You shouldn't be down here alone.<eos> I'm not alone.<eos> I'm with you.
The committees have a new curator they do not miss the old one.<eos> If my victory pleased the professore, I could not tell.<eos> Then you weren't paying attention.<eos> I pay lots of attention.<eos> But not in a wide-eyed, indiscriminate way.<eos> That may have been impulsive.<eos> Been mulling that impulse ever since you decided to serve Punch Romaine.<eos> I... I can't see.<eos> Technically, you killed him.<eos> No longer interested in... preserving the peace you found here?
Hannibal wanted to kill that man for what he did to Mischa.<eos> I wouldn't let him take his life, so Hannibal left his life with me.<eos> He was... curious... if you would kill.<eos> I imagine he still is.<eos> What were you like as a young man?<eos> I was rooting for Mephistopheles and contemptuous of Faust.<eos> Would you like to talk about your first spring lamb?<eos> Would you?<eos> Why can't you go home, Hannibal?<eos> What happened to you there?
I'm sorry.<eos> You did this.<eos> You set him free.<eos> It was you I wanted to set free.<eos> You said Hannibal was curious if I would kill.<eos> You were curious too.<eos> - I didn't want this.<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> You were doing what he does.<eos> He'd be proud of you, his nakama.
So you want to carry on, do you?<eos> Aye, cos I don't think they should get away with it.<eos> These lads were all young... and they were drunk and they were violent.<eos> They're going to go and do it to some other lass... and they want stopping.<eos> Right.<eos> If that's what you want, we'll carry on.<eos> Descriptions?<eos> Done?<eos> Happy?<eos> Your friend Tommy who came in with you said you seemed to completely miss the punch, and that's not something that happens.
So why did it lay you out?<eos> Didn't see it.<eos> Did you lose your vision, Mr Gently?<eos> I got some sweat in my eyes.<eos> I was blinking it out and he hit me.<eos> I'll be having words with him, I can tell you.<eos> You mustn't box again until we get to the root of this problem, Inspector.<eos> There isn't a problem.<eos> How many times has this happened before?<eos> It's been very nice to meet you, Dr Benson, and thank you for your concern... but I'm fine.
~ Ah, she trusts him.<eos> ~ Mm-hm.<eos> ~ And he trusts her, presumably.<eos> ~ Yep.<eos> I thought you were better than this, John.<eos> Well, I'm not.<eos> So what do you want me to do now then, guv?<eos> Go and help Rachel.<eos> Right.<eos> Are you going to tell me what's wrong with you, guv?
I've waited my whole life to breathe fresh air.<eos> That's Emerson.<eos> Let's get back to this secret army that she claims to have.<eos> She tell you anything that might help us find it?<eos> Stop drilling, please.<eos> The window for extraction after death is incredibly short.<eos> I only need a minute.<eos> No, sir.<eos> Nothing about the army.<eos> She did say she was coming for you and that if we let her people go she'll let our people live.
What are you doing?<eos> Get away from him.<eos> - Gah! - I said get away from him!<eos> You don't understand.<eos> I can't fight it.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> We can.<eos> I betrayed your brother.<eos> He's a prisoner in the mountain because of me.<eos> Lincoln, I don't know what happened between you two, but Bellamy made it, he's fine.
If we go north and you're wrong, then all of us will die.<eos> If we turn back now, we live.<eos> So that's it?<eos> We've reached the point of no return?<eos> You just want to give up?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> You didn't not say it either.<eos> That is the North Star.<eos> After you.<eos> The rest of you need to decide for yourselves, but either way, we'll come back for you when we find it.
No more wasted lives.<eos> In 48 hours, we will all be on the ground.<eos> Take off the the hoods.<eos> No.<eos> - Dad?<eos> - Nate!<eos> Uh!<eos> Uh! No!<eos> You bastards!<eos> What is wrong with you people?
Come on.<eos> You're a survivor.<eos> We both are.<eos> Whatever you have to tell yourself feel better, Chancellor.<eos> Our destiny... is out there, John.<eos> And what about Craig's destiny?<eos> We sacrificed a few to save the many.<eos> You know, you're right.<eos> I am a survivor... which is exactly why<eos> I am done following you.
I mean, what if she got caught?<eos> We'd have heard something.<eos> Then what if she couldn't find Sergeant Lee or...<eos> I don't know... the protocol changed?<eos> What if he got caught?<eos> Jasper, a warrior doesn't worry about what he can't control.<eos> Oh, thank god.<eos> Anyone see you?<eos> Lee, put down the gun.<eos> You didn't say there was an outsider with you.
Hopefully with animatronic robots.<eos> You said you wouldn't make fun of it.<eos> Oh, man, is that from Rocky Horror?<eos> Do you remember when I had to wear those tight gold shorts?<eos> I think everyone remembers that.<eos> Wow. You can't do it, can you?<eos> I mean, almost everything else is boxed up, but you haven't even touched this wall.<eos> All my best memories from high school are on that wall.<eos> My whole childhood I just spent in this room singing and dreaming, all alone with pictures of Barbara Streisand and Patti Lupone and Bernadette Peters.<eos> But then I met you guys and suddenly the wall started to fill up with real friends and real dreams.
He doesn't have a blue jacket, but if he took yours, Ben, I'm sorry.<eos> Okay, Abby.<eos> Abby?<eos> Right here, dad!<eos> Ready to go?<eos> Yeah, but we got to stop at the police station on the way.<eos> Why?<eos> Do they know who killed Tom?<eos> Not yet, but there's something I have to tell the detective.<eos> - What is wrong with you? !
- Don't forget.<eos> You have tickets for the theater.<eos> - I won't.<eos> Now, it's women who run these households<eos> - and no-one ever asks them what they want so I did.<eos> Here's some research and a survey I ran shows that what these people really want is hot and cold running water.<eos> Electricity throughout each and every house, a private lavatory inside, and a private garden...<eos> - Victor.<eos> - Violette.<eos> - Your French gentleman not with you?
And we will not attend this evening.<eos> Please, Monsieur Longchamp.<eos> I've been on leave.<eos> We will fix this.<eos> - Isn't that right, Mrs. Leclair?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> I give you one last chance.<eos> We chose Selfridge's because of your legendary displays.<eos> You have until this afternoon.<eos> Always the same with you, Thackeray.
! Would that be so very terrible?<eos> No.<eos> As long as you like my idea for tonight.<eos> It's not me you have to please.<eos> Let's do this your way, then.<eos> Will your boss be pleased?<eos> Can you type these up for me, Miss Plunkett?<eos> I need them for tonight's board meeting.<eos> - Mr. Selfridge, I absolutely need -<eos> - Later, Crabb. - I need to speak with you -
Serge, that is not a request!<eos> And I mean it too.<eos> It's just business, Harry.<eos> And you of all people should appreciate that.<eos> Don't, Mr. Crabb.<eos> For both of our sakes, don't.<eos> So be it.<eos> Directors are starting to arrive.<eos> Arthur?<eos> Are you all right?
- We are honored by your presence.<eos> Monsieur Leclair!<eos> Such a handsome young man when we last met 'a Paris.'<eos> What happened?<eos> That's the survey result.<eos> And personal references for my past work.<eos> Very thorough.<eos> That should impress the board.<eos> Wish me luck, Miss Webb.<eos> I hope to see you downstairs afterward for the fashion event.
Psst!<eos> Good evening, Miss Calthorpe.<eos> Accessories is looking very attractive under your direction.<eos> I've done my best, Miss Mardle.<eos> But I'm sure you'll find some improvements when you return.<eos> I'm here to see Mr. Grove.<eos> I won't be coming back to Accessories, Miss Calthorpe.<eos> You keep up the good work.<eos> Madame Lanvin and Mr. Leclair, together, please.<eos> Madame Lanvin, are you aware your countryman survived the horrors of Verdun?
Think you're a bit above this?<eos> Course he doesn't.<eos> I can speak for myself.<eos> I don't think I'm above this. No.<eos> My only concern is for my friend and our club.<eos> Both of which are in the pink at the moment. Wouldn't you say?<eos> I hear, what's her name, the Selfridge girl, hasn't been here much of late.<eos> She's got a name.<eos> Violette.<eos> All over between you two?
Over the next three months, your share value will increase no less than 10%.<eos> - You have my word. - (ALL MURMURING)<eos> Placing it all on red, Selfridge?<eos> Thank you all for attending today. Thank you.<eos> 10%?<eos> How on earth are we going to fulfil such a promise?<eos> We'll find a way, Mr Crabb. We always do.<eos> PRINCESS MARIE: And those... That fan is very beautiful.<eos> This fan is delightful.<eos> I need to talk to you.
I should have just left well alone.<eos> Billy won't go away.<eos> If I don't do something soon, I know he's going to tell Mr Grove and I daren't think how that will turn out. (SIGHS)<eos> - He has to know.<eos> No, I can't tell him.<eos> - Because I just...<eos> Is it because you don't want him thinking badly of you?<eos> You've been carrying a heavy burden.<eos> But he has to know.<eos> Would you like me to accompany you?
No, I can't tell him.<eos> - Because I just...<eos> Is it because you don't want him thinking badly of you?<eos> You've been carrying a heavy burden.<eos> But he has to know.<eos> Would you like me to accompany you?<eos> No. But thank you, Arthur.<eos> Evening, Fraser.<eos> Have I missed supper?<eos> Mr Selfridge would like to speak with you, sir.
I want my bar mitzvah to be perfect.<eos> Not good, not great... perfect.<eos> How can I improve this number?<eos> Seriously, give me notes. Anything.<eos> Um... maybe your dancers could just smile a little bit more?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, exactly.<eos> I-I already told them that.<eos> I already told you that!<eos> What's wrong with you people?
♪ No, no, no, no, no ♪<eos> ♪ No place I'd rather be ♪<eos> ♪ When I am with you ♪<eos> ♪ There's no place I'd rather be. ♪<eos> All right! Great job, guys.<eos> That was really impressive.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Okay, now I know you guys probably still have vacation brain, but any pointers would really help us out.<eos> Guys, thoughts?<eos> What is going on with you, guys?
are you okay?<eos> Do you have a history of profound mental illness?<eos> What I have a history of, Geraldo, is devoting my entire life to the students of McKinley High.<eos> You know, when I graduated from the Sorbonne, I was recruited by every single one of Wall Street's top investment banks.<eos> Halliburton wanted me for their COO.<eos> One time, a very drunk Boris Yeltsin called to tell me that if I wanted Russia, he would just give it to me.<eos> I could've had wealth and power beyond my wildest dreams!<eos> But instead, I chose a career filled with service and sacrifice in order to nurture and enrich the delicate minds of America's children.<eos> Since day one, they have been and will continue to be my number one priority.<eos> Sue, a lot of these things that you have just mentioned seem like lies to me.
I'll say it till the cows come home:<eos> Sue Sylvester saved my life.<eos> I was in an abusive marriage to a man they call Cooter the football recruiter, and Sue supported me leaving him.<eos> Also, when I chose to transition,<eos> Sue supported that, too.<eos> Hey, wait, why are the lights off?<eos> I'm not trying to hide my identity.<eos> I'm proud to stand up for Sue Sylvester.<eos> I am as I am, Geraldo Rivera.<eos> And I refuse to apologize to you or anybody else.
You can't expect us to adopt your uniforms, too.<eos> But, you know, it would save us the effort of having to try and find a new look.<eos> Okay, look, you guys, we've had a lot of success with this in the past, so we'll just give you our uniforms to wear during the competition.<eos> Red T-shirts and Converse are not uniforms.<eos> You have costumes.<eos> Guys, enough!<eos> We need to have some unity here, okay?<eos> Look, you attend McKinley now.<eos> I'm really sorry, guys, but the blazers need to go.<eos> We are grateful that you've welcomed us to your school, and to be performing with you guys, but we didn't choose to come here.
But that's impossible.<eos> Rachel Berry is paying for the Glee Club out of her own pocket.<eos> But this goes beyond what she can afford, and this is also about allocation of facilities and resources.<eos> I mean, that choir room has to go back to being a computer lab or at least another classroom.<eos> I just can't believe it after everything that we've been through.<eos> This could be worse.<eos> We've survived far more difficult things, not just in Glee Club, but in life.<eos> You know, screw it.<eos> We've had to fight for everything we've earned in our lives, and this is just the beginning of a new fight.<eos> I am so proud of you all.
I mean, I think it's inevitable.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> All right, I'm gonna go.<eos> I'll see you soon.<eos> (whooping and cheering) All right, the next first-place trophy in that case is gonna be regionals.<eos> (cheering) You know, someday... five, ten, 20 years from now... You're gonna walk into this school and you're gonna see the trophies in that case or... or maybe you'll be watching your own sons and daughters win their awards, and I hope you'll remember this time in your life,<eos> this incredible moment when a group of very different people put aside their differences, supported each other and formed a team, and hopefully made some lifelong friendships.<eos> Now, some of our advisors are gonna be leaving us, but no matter where we go, no matter where we are, we will always be here in spirit, and we will always be supporting you.<eos> Now, a chapter in Glee Club history may be ending, but it is just the beginning for all of you.<eos> We could not be more proud of you.
Kurt, Blaine, the whole time I was planning this high-end barn wedding, all I could think about was you guys, and not because you remind me of the pig and the gay rat from Charlotte's Web, but because I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you guys, okay?<eos> I looked up to you as a couple in high school.<eos> You showed me there was a place for me and Santana, too.<eos> I mean, you taught me how to be brave.<eos> And when you guys called off your wedding, it just broke my heart.<eos> Because it felt like my dream had died, so I want my dream back.<eos> Okay.<eos> I still don't get what you're talking about, though.<eos> Yes, you do, just think about it.<eos> What Brittany is saying, Blaine, is that out of our love for your love, we have conspired to deceive and manipulate and, yes, imprison you briefly all to reach this moment.
An ole-- an ole fa-- an ole fashion.<eos> Come on.<eos> Get some zip in ya.<eos> God damn it!<eos> It's on them.<eos> Well, it's a war.<eos> Nixon declared it.<eos> The war on cancer.<eos> As long as it's not a war on me.<eos> No, no, it's not a war against you.
If he talks out of turn, I take his tongue.<eos> But you-- your children, your grandchildren-- what are you willing to do to show us you're committed?<eos> I'll deal with my son.<eos> This partnership will hold.<eos> Oh, come on, you're gonna let this guy come here<eos> - and disrespect us, disrespect pop?<eos> - Quiet!<eos> - Bunch of fruits in ties and pocket protectors.<eos> - Take him out now!<eos> - I'll pick my teeth with you.

Let's dance.<eos> Ben, you need to teach your friend some manners.<eos> How about Mike Milligan out of Kansas City?<eos> You know where we can find him?<eos> Pretty sure he's looking for your brother, too.<eos> Uh, Uncle Dodd?<eos> Uncle Dodd, Hanzee called.<eos> - Not now.<eos> - Said it's real important.<eos> Wants you to meet him at the dig.
Gerhardt!<eos> ...that we, all of us, hunger to, once again, see honor placed above political expediency to see government once again the protector of liberties, not the distributor of gifts and privilege.<eos> Government should uphold and not undermine those institutions which are custodians of the very values upon which civilization is founded...<eos> Religion, education, and above all, family.<eos> Wait.<eos> We, who are privileged to be Americans, have had a rendezvous with destiny since the moment in 1630 when John Winthrop, standing on the deck of the tiny Arbella off the coast of Massachusetts, told that little band of pilgrims,<eos> "We shall be as a city upon a hill."<eos> A troubled and afflicted mankind looks to us, pleading for us to keep our rendezvous with destiny, that we will uphold the principles of self-reliance, self-discipline, morality, and above all, responsible liberty for every individual...<eos> That we will become that shining city on a hill.<eos> My friends, I believe that you and I together can keep this rendezvous with destiny.
Was that how it was in the bedroom with Kathy?<eos> Don't you talk about her.<eos> She strap one on, bend you over the bed, and show you who's boss?<eos> There's gonna be a reckoning one day, brother.<eos> All souls are called to account for their actions.<eos> In the end, we all get what we deserve.<eos> You keep telling yourself that.<eos> The eyes of all people are upon us, so that if we shall deal falsely with our God in this work we have undertaken, and so cause him to withdraw his presence him from us, we shall be made a story and a byword throughout the world.<eos> A troubled and afflicted mankind looks to us.<eos> My friends, I believe that you and I together can keep this rendezvous with destiny.
This mess has got us...<eos> You Minnesota boys don't got much in the way a backbone, now do you?<eos> Well, now, I wouldn't say that.<eos> Just like to think things through.<eos> Army?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Liberated France in the Great War.<eos> Not singlehandedly, but I like to think they couldn't have done it without me.<eos> Well, then you know it's the generals that do the thinkin' and everybody else just says "how high?"<eos> Not gonna debate the merits of top-down decision makin' with you, Captain,
Oh boy, I should have taken the Miami route.<eos> That's him!<eos> Wait!<eos> I'm getting off.<eos> We must defend...<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> See you in four days!<eos> Make him work for it.<eos> Let us be seen as one Chilean with dignity. As a Chilean who stands side by side with the poorest.<eos> Here I am with the rest of you, my colleagues. Because I want to defend what is ours.
Oh, nothing really.<eos> We, ah, just forgot the photographs.<eos> And we need them, because we're going to nail these guys.<eos> Why aren't we getting out?<eos> You're safe here.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> To an underground entrance so you won't be seen.<eos> Relax.<eos> It may not be the most comfortable place, but it's absolutely safe.<eos> I'll pick you up as soon boarding begins.
Pack your things.<eos> So while my hands are full, I need you to serve as my eyes and ears.<eos> I can't just stab him in the back.<eos> I don't know if you have a choice.<eos> He should be here by now.<eos> Something must have happened.<eos> - Everything ok?<eos> - Are we going to Algiers or what?<eos> Right now, that club is the safest place in town.<eos> You lost the one thing that you could have used against me, the weapon you created.
If things go south, that dagger might come in handy.<eos> Kol gave me that dagger for my protection.<eos> I'll be the one who decides if it gets used.<eos> Now I have to get back to work.<eos> Your transparent attempts to therapize me failed, brother.<eos> I suggest you allow me to make my way home in peace.<eos> Enough with the games, Niklaus.<eos> Now is not the time.<eos> Must I beseech you to stand with us?<eos> If by "us" you mean you and Freya, then I will not be standing with you.
There's, uh, something I need to, um...<eos> Look.<eos> Um, the reason you didn't get out of the compound last night was because of me.<eos> I did it on purpose for Klaus.<eos> No.<eos> I...<eos> He sucked me in.<eos> He appealed to my stupid ego, told me everything that I wanted to hear.<eos> Ok.<eos> Last night, he wanted me to watch you guys.
I did ask you here in the hopes that you would share some of Dahlia's secrets.<eos> So without further ado, let's get to it.<eos> The first thing you should know is that Dahlia's the most powerful witch I have ever seen.<eos> She craves more power still.<eos> Right now, she is like me, limited to one year of life in a century, but she wants to be free of that restriction, to gain true immortality, and that is why she will come here, drawn by your daughter to take the child's power for herself.<eos> She will kill anyone who would defy her.<eos> And yet you would defy her.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> She will never let me be free.<eos> My one chance is to align with you and kill her.
He threatened and manipulated his enemies, tried to steal an innocent child, and executed his brother.<eos> Mr. Griffith, Vincent, what you experienced was a violation of a profoundly personal nature, and whatever you're feeling, I am here to listen.<eos> That's just it.<eos> What do I say?<eos> Am... am... am I... Am I supposed to feel bad for these people that I hurt, am I... am I supposed to feel guilty for this...<eos> For this man I killed?<eos> I...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Hey. It's ok.<eos> You're gonna be ok.
Don't run, and I won't hurt you.<eos> I won't let that witch get her hands on my niece, which means we're gonna have to do this the hard way.<eos> What about Alaska?<eos> I could live in Alaska.<eos> Good evening, crescents.<eos> It will come as no surprise to learn that things will not be ending well for you.<eos> Go back inside.<eos> Get Hope and Mary out of here.<eos> - I can help you.<eos> - I'll be right behind you.
Previously on "The Originals"...<eos> Dahlia will come here, drawn by your daughter.<eos> She will kill anyone who would defy her.<eos> Yet you would defy her.<eos> My one chance is to align with you and kill her.
I told him what I knew, but if Eva's coming back here, I don't want anything to do with her.<eos> Rebekah? Rebekah?<eos> I'm having flashes of memory, but they fade almost as soon as I've had them.<eos> All of us live with a demon inside.<eos> Rebekah Mikaelson!<eos> You can't hide from me forever!<eos> Some days, you control the demon...<eos> This is my house!<eos> You ok?<eos> And other days, it controls you.
You ok?<eos> And other days, it controls you.<eos> And it is always hungry.<eos> It feeds on lust, on longing.<eos> And while you may slumber, the demon never sleeps.<eos> It tempts you into crossing every line you've ever drawn...<eos> All while it hunts you...<eos> Haunts you...<eos> Renders you incapable of telling friend from foe...<eos> But once it has turned your loved ones into enemies, the demon will have consumed you whole.
You haven't been yourself lately.<eos> You're right.<eos> I haven't been, but now that I'm back, I realize something.<eos> The only time I've ever been myself... is when I'm with her.<eos> No!<eos> What is taking so long?<eos> You didn't tarry when you attempted to kill my child.<eos> I took no joy in that.<eos> I knew if your daughter lived<eos> Dahlia would come not only for her but for all of you, and however you may despise me, I would not wish that upon you.
Charges filed by Dinah Laurel Lance, assistant district att--<eos> Hey, stop.<eos> Stop!<eos> I'll tell you where you can find Brick.<eos> If you're looking for Thea, she's not here.<eos> I know.<eos> I came to see you.<eos> Following me, Mr. Harper?<eos> You need to stay away from her.<eos> I don't know why you want her to leave Starling City, but I'm not letting her go anywhere with you.
How is your evening going, madame Mayor?<eos> Mine's not going too well.<eos> Because your city's "vigilante problem" became mine earlier tonight. And it's forced my hand--<eos> Look, if you have demands to make, just get on with it.<eos> No demands, just Shakespeare.<eos> "Julius Caesar,"<eos> Act Five, Scene Two.<eos> "They stand and would have parley."<eos> The war stops and together they converse.<eos> I would have parley with you.
I'm friends with your daughter Sara.<eos> Yeah, yeah. I thought you looked familiar.<eos> Haven't seen you in a while.<eos> Well, I haven't seen Sara in a while.<eos> Well, then you missed some major ass-kicking tonight.<eos> That woman running around in black leather tonight, that wasn't Sara.<eos> Well, sure it was.<eos> Who else would it be?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> That's why I'm talking to you.
Would you?<eos> Of course.<eos> He's family.<eos> According to Laurel, Fisher's lawyer called Brick with the time and the place of the outgoing call.<eos> Can you trace that call back to where Brick is?<eos> At least where his phone is.<eos> His burner phone, to be exact.<eos> It's at a warehouse in the Glades.<eos> We'll check it out.<eos> I'll have to talk you in from Palmer Tech.
Is that even a remote possibility?<eos> - Didn't think so.<eos> - We aren't gonna die here.<eos> - Oliver would never let that happen.<eos> - He let this happen.<eos> Wah-reeth al Ghul commands your presence.<eos> Leave us.<eos> - Is everyone okay?<eos> - Like you give a damn.<eos> - Didn't Malcolm speak to you?
If you go to anyone else, particularly the media, with these unsubstantiated allegations, Mr. Queen would have the basis for a slam dunk defamation suit that would leave you bankrupt.<eos> Who knows, he might even get his company back.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> Court system isn't going to be able to help me here.<eos> Guess I'll just have to seek out justice on my own.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm a United States senator.<eos> Everything's going to be all right.<eos> Get down, get down, down, down, down, now!<eos> We're here for you, Senator, but we need to move fast.
Oh, I have a house guest coming, so it's time for you to go now.<eos> Bon voyage, as they say.<eos> Must've hurt like a motherfucker.<eos> For a second I thought you really were dead.<eos> You have to commit if you want to sell it.<eos> You've got some giant balls taking a hit like that.<eos> The Rumanceks are world-renowned for their testicular girth.<eos> A thousand thankyous for what you did.<eos> Yeah, well, you saved my life.<eos> Anyways, it was great being out with you guys - full moon.
It just didn't seem like the sort of thing one leaves on voice mail.<eos> I've been shot, you fucking idiot.<eos> Get me Pryce!<eos> Dr. Pryce is dead.<eos> What?<eos> It happened last night.<eos> How?<eos> Um, one of his patients had a psychotic break and went... berserk, stabbed him... uh... severed the abdominal aorta, and he was, um, gone in a few minutes.<eos> This is fucking not... This is not happening!<eos> - Wait, who did this to you?
Stop coming to my house.<eos> My family is risking their lives for you. I know.<eos> You guys are awesome.<eos> No, you don't get it!<eos> They don't have a choice now.<eos> There is no going back for us. You have made us Raja's co-conspirators.<eos> If you have us start a failed coup from this living room, we will all be killed.<eos> Well, you know, to be fair, Raja was going to kill you - if this thing goes south anyway.<eos> - What?<eos> I'm sorry, I didn't have time to consult you, but things were moving very fast and I had to improvise, which is my strength, but it's going to work, because we are the righteous and we are the good.
- I haven't seen this in years.<eos> - Well, the nerd survival kit is still intact.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - I thought those might be worth something.<eos> I am so late for work.<eos> I promise I will clean this up when I get back, okay?<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Bye, yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You mind telling me what's going on with you and iris?
- The flash isn't so different from us.<eos> He's got partners too.<eos> - Jason rush?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Dr. Snow?<eos> - Please, call me caitlin.<eos> Thank you for meeting me.<eos> - Oh, happy to.<eos> Although, to be totally up front, If this is about the resume I mailed in to s.T.A.R. Labs, I've already accepted a position at mercury labs.<eos> - No, actually, I wanted to talk to you about F.I.R.E.S.T.O.R.M.
Bombers use bombs.<eos> I don't know. Maybe it was an accident. Maybe she was just trying to draw attention<eos> And things went too far.<eos> Why would she send in the video?<eos> To apologize? She's looking for other eco-terrorists,<eos> Planning her second attack.<eos> Well, the sheriff thinks she's acting alone.<eos> Alone?<eos> Wabacooche county sheriff blue backstrom.<eos> Any relation to you?
Wow. Yes.<eos> That fits perfectly.<eos> Wake up, lieutenant.<eos> We're on indian land.<eos> Oh, hell.<eos> You know that guy?<eos> From a serial-killer case.<eos> He hates me.<eos> Why?<eos> 'cause he worked with you?
'cause the serial killer was targeting indians, And I caught him.<eos> Talk about ingratitude.<eos> Rocha.<eos> Is that a totem pole in your pocket, Or are you just happy to see me?<eos> Long time, same lieutenant.<eos> Hand over little miss terrorist, And we'll get out of your ponytail.<eos> I don't have a ponytail.<eos> You have no jurisdiction to carry guns on sovereign land.<eos> You people have no respect For the fraternity of law-enforcement officers.<eos> And by "you people," I mean "mall cops."
Already?<eos> They send smoke signals? Carrying illegal firearms, assaulting a tribal officer, Using offensive racial slurs.<eos> They were impeding a high-profile woman hunt.<eos> Moto can vouch for me.<eos> He's named on the complaint, too.<eos> Then I'll vouch for him. Am I the only cop in portland you're trying to destroy?<eos> I heard blue was there.<eos> So? We're after his fugitive.<eos> Oh. You wouldn't help blue out of a pit of vipers.<eos> I know how it is with you two.
Eleanor deering is the head Of the lake oswego conservancy board.<eos> And owns a home there.<eos> Husband in the house, Lesbian lover in the shed overlooking the water.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> You and almond, search these areas For possible bomb targets.<eos> Let's go arrest your heroes.<eos> Excuse me for interrupting, gentlemen.<eos> Sheriff backstrom, my name is sergeant peter niedermayer.<eos> I work with your son in special crimes.<eos> It's an honor to meet you, sir.
Yeah, the peace-giving courts.<eos> Do you believe in restorative justice?<eos> I don't much trust our system.<eos> They can't do worse.<eos> You won't mind if I tell the lieutenant, would you?<eos> Not at all.<eos> Hell, send him a picture.<eos> Good to see you, captain.<eos> Then you're an even bigger idiot than I thought, niedermayer.<eos> I think that he is trying to smooth things over Between you and the tribe.
So we'll protect her.<eos> We can't even keep her in our own house.<eos> She does exactly what this "Drill" thing wants.<eos> Henry, Minx, they all do.<eos> So until this is over, you will go to your mother's.<eos> You can't just send us away.<eos> Lena.<eos> No, this is my home.<eos> You are my home.<eos> If anything happened to you...
I got better things to do anyway!<eos> Meatball here has a very clear vision of who he wants to be as an artist.<eos> Well, at Big Machine, we give our artists complete creative control.<eos> That way, your connection with your audience stays real.<eos> Even when you're playing stadium shows.<eos> Great, so what are the next steps here?<eos> I have my meeting with the president of the company on Friday.<eos> Your demo will be the first thing I play him.<eos> And if he likes it?<eos> Well, then you boys are looking at a record deal.
Of course.<eos> It's a family thing.<eos> I completely understand.<eos> Oh, my God, I do, I love you so much.<eos> I'll be in touch, okay?<eos> And that's another thing, don't be afraid to let yourself cry.<eos> If you can.<eos> It's corny, but tears really are the holiest of water.<eos> But you'll also want to hydrate.<eos> Sally, it's been wonderful to spend this time with you.
The state Charlie's in... he's not going anywhere.<eos> I didn't get what I came for last night.<eos> And I got a present for Charlie.<eos> Hey, Howard?<eos> What do you want?<eos> This belong to you?<eos> Look, I know Shafe's a cop.<eos> What kind of idiot throws a rock through a cop's window?<eos> I don't know, Howard, what kind of idiot are you?<eos> Jesus, what is wrong with you?
Hey, Howard?<eos> What do you want?<eos> This belong to you?<eos> Look, I know Shafe's a cop.<eos> What kind of idiot throws a rock through a cop's window?<eos> I don't know, Howard, what kind of idiot are you?<eos> Jesus, what is wrong with you?<eos> Careful there, you wouldn't want to dent it.<eos> New paint job, fresh wax.<eos> Hey... hey, hey, are you out of your... what is wrong with you?
Well, actually, one has had his struggles.<eos> I managed my husband's plumbing company for over 20 years.<eos> And a couple of years ago, I went back to work in the restaurant business.<eos> I see you worked at the, uh, division 1 café.<eos> Well, I didn't just work there.<eos> I was the café's cook, waitress, manager, dishwasher, And occasional bouncer.<eos> [ chuckles ]<eos> That actually all sounds good. I'm a hard worker, mr.<eos> Martin. And I'm really good with people.<eos> And I -- well, I would like to work with you.
Emotionally avail--<eos> When did you start watching "dr.<eos> Phil"? [ chuckling ] that would be never.<eos> But kiki helped me understand That my deepest emotional fulfillment came from work.<eos> I often wonder if I could have balanced a career And a marriage to casey.<eos> That's something you would have had to work on together.<eos> I think kiki would point out That casey's own issues with marriage and career Complicated the relationship.<eos> [ dog barking in distance ] I'm so sorry I hurt you, carol.<eos> I think I'd like your kiki.<eos> [ indistinct conversation ] What's the deal between you two?
- Yeah, I'll do it.<eos> Frankie's down at the firing range practicing, and from what I hear, he needs it.<eos> - Did Jane put you up to this?<eos> - She only wants to help.<eos> I can handle my own money... Just fine.<eos> Of course. Of course. But with income from the new job, it might help to just establish some rules for yourself.<eos> - Rules?<eos> - Like... practicing restraint.<eos> Not splurging on expensive items.<eos> And I have a few strategies of my own I can share with you.
Not even a little bit.<eos> I'll run the number, let you know when we find her.<eos> Am I right?<eos> I'm at the address now.<eos> The cell pinged from that location less than a half-hour ago.<eos> Backup's on the way now.<eos> Tell them she's on the move.<eos> Zoe Blyer?<eos> Hey. Boston police!<eos> I just wanna talk to you!
Dylan visited your office several times last week.<eos> How did you know that?<eos> We have a source.<eos> About all I can say now.<eos> A source.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, I came down here because I wanted to help, but now I'm wondering if I should have an attorney present.<eos> Our source is a private investigator.<eos> Zoe Blyer hired him to follow Dylan because she thought he might be having an affair.<eos> With you, actually.
- What is it? - Uh, it's an ethics committee.<eos> They review and they publish cases of interest to the medical community at large.<eos> And dr. Isles is the first president-elect in the field of forensic pathology.<eos> Yes, and the first whose patients are all dead.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, we used to be the outcasts of the medical community.<eos> Not long ago, a medical degree wasn't even required<eos> - to be certified, so...<eos> - This is a really big deal.<eos> And N.E.M.O. is very lucky to have you.
"I'll take the secret to my grave."<eos> ~ Does that mean anything to you?<eos> ~ No.<eos> Do you know him?<eos> I can't say.<eos> Oh, like that, is it?<eos> Eh?<eos> Sorry. Who are you?<eos> Lady Felicia's driver.<eos> Are you all right?
What a fruitbat he was.<eos> He organised the heirlooms in colour order, according to their aura.<eos> So you don't go over to the part of the house where they work?<eos> They use dangerous chemicals!<eos> No, they said it was safest for me to stay clear.<eos> Not that I mind, of course.<eos> No, I'm quite happy here with Terrance.<eos> Terrance?<eos> Nobody is to touch anything in this room until I give the word.<eos> You're all to return home and remain there until I send for you.
"I'll take the secret to my grave."<eos> He must have left it as a safeguard in case anything happened to him.<eos> ~ He knew he was in danger.<eos> ~ But why didn't he ask for help?<eos> Why put yourself in harm's way?<eos> Perhaps he was involved in something illegal?<eos> ~ I'll find out more about the official investigation. ~ Good.<eos> ~ Cheerio. ~ Anon, anon. ~ Thank you.<eos> Hello, Archie.<eos> Lord Masters, do you think I might have a quick word?
I need something from you in return.<eos> The man who died.<eos> I want details.<eos> Why not?<eos> Your friend might unearth something useful.<eos> But you know the price.<eos> Yes.<eos> You swapped the vases!<eos> Now, don't you go giving me grief.<eos> Someone had to tidy up the mess you made...
Before I came here, I prayed that you only acted to defend your husband.<eos> That you had no idea of his political beliefs.<eos> On the contrary, you defected to his cause.<eos> And why would you think that?<eos> When he was cornered, William took his own life... .. as I imagine he was trained to do, rather than be captured.<eos> And you showed your hand when you put cyanide... .. into your tea.<eos> I will not let you take your own life and your child's.<eos> It won't be long now.<eos> I swapped the teas.<eos> I should just follow you around all day, Father.
Yeah.<eos> It started when you kids were little, huh'?<eos> We'd get Meggy to sleep, and that would take about three hours... then we'd sit out here and watch you boys swimming and playing till it was pitch-black dark out.<eos> And Sarah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I remember you fighting with her.<eos> BOY-<eos> Yeah, she would've...<eos> She'd have played with you three all night if we'd let her.
Hey.<eos> So seeing your mom really brought back memories.<eos> I wanted to talk to you about that.<eos> She told me you stopped by.<eos> Yeah, I--<eos> I thought I could help out with the rent.<eos> Rent, and then some.<eos> Look, it's really generous, but she's not your responsibility.<eos> Is she yours?<eos> Because I remember growing up, she was horrible to you two.
If he died a hero, at least the town that loved him could hold on to that memory.<eos> And maybe part of you did it for him... to preserve his memory.<eos> Or... you hated him.<eos> And I say that solely based on the fact that you tried to kill him.<eos> He was a crackhead and he was going to take the both of you down.<eos> So you took him down first, in a blaze of glory, and you were gonna rise back up through his ashes and replace him as mayor.<eos> Go ahead and jump.<eos> You can make it.<eos> Honest.<eos> After everything that he did to you, you shouldn't die for him, Darrel.
A lot of facets to be worked out.<eos> While I'm in the region, I will meet with Raja and work out the details.<eos> Well, that's kind of vague, Walter.<eos> When are you talking to him next?<eos> Soon.<eos> Just keep Pierce on his choke collar.<eos> Make sure he doesn't shit all over my plan.<eos> Your plan is bullshit!<eos> You're nowhere, Larson!<eos> Pierce is there with you?
Everything was operational when we...<eos> Came under threat.<eos> Sir?<eos> When all of a sudden you thought you were under legitimate threat.<eos> Um, not exactly.<eos> Sir, the truth is...<eos> Let the admiral finish, commander.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You fired your sidewinder under the normal rules of engagement.<eos> Fully justified given the information you had at the time.
- No.<eos> Did you ask him?<eos> No, I didn't want to spread any unfounded rumors.<eos> Well, then I guess you'll never know.<eos> Being here, having no impact, I understand how hard that can be for a person like you.<eos> But hear me, Jackie Peyton.<eos> You are a nonfactor in this hospital.<eos> That's a lot of old people.<eos> Okay, let's go.<eos> Hello, can we play with you?
Copy that.<eos> Okay, nobody's home... neither kid.<eos> All right.<eos> CSI?<eos> Couple computers, some video-game consoles... stuff Keefer can dig into later, but...<eos> Right, but that's gonna take time.<eos> Well, Rentman caught a graze to the ear.<eos> Checked every hospital, drugstore, and pharmacy in an eight-by-eight.<eos> - Don't you report to somebody?<eos> - Not you.
- Is that what you want?<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> It was my fault.<eos> It's my first day on the floor.<eos> I'm still figuring out where the forks go, if you know what I mean.<eos> I do not.<eos> But hear this-- you must be very clear about people's roles at this hospital.<eos> You're right.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Let's you and I sit down and go over all the ins and outs to ensure something like this doesn't happen again.
America is conducting covert operations without consulting with them first.<eos> You killed your own men, Viktor.<eos> It was your man who got shot last night.<eos> I mean the blast.<eos> We have the intel.<eos> It was you, not terrorists.<eos> It was FSB.<eos> So you humiliate me in Washington, humiliate me in Moscow, and now you insult me with these ridiculous fantasies.<eos> What do you want out of all of this, Viktor?<eos> Justice, for my soldiers who died on a mission you devised.
You will become a great writer.<eos> Will you help me to become a real actress?<eos> A real actress?<eos> My mother wouldn't approve.<eos> "Today we had chicken fricassee with béchamel sauce for dinner."<eos> Perfect, if not for the bunch of people in the frame.<eos> Leave her alone.<eos> Malady of love<eos> Malady of youth...<eos> Monsieur Leon, what's happening to you?
Bet he had a lot of data worth killing for.<eos> Attorney general again.<eos> So the target murders Cade, steals his government secrets and then wipes his devices clean to remove any trace of the intrusion.<eos> That's a smart move.<eos> Clean up a crime scene with bleach after the kill.<eos> Everything in here should recover the wiped info from the vic's devices, okay?<eos> Just plug it in.<eos> I already know all this, Krumitz.<eos> This is a big case.<eos> I should be coming with you to Boston.
Everything okay?<eos> Yes, I just need to get some air.<eos> Everybody okay in there?<eos> No one critical?<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> How's your crew holding up?<eos> The entire ER nursing staff of a major city hospital walked out and nobody cared, so it's a tragedy.<eos> - Do you want some help?<eos> - From you?<eos> Just 'cause I'm not standing out here with you guys doesn't mean that I don't agree with what you're doing.
- Big Shankhead here...<eos> - Cormaneau...<eos> - I'm a nice person...<eos> - The name's Mike Miller...<eos> - Balls are clean...<eos> I am a liar.<eos> Oh, look who it is, everybody.<eos> Mike Miller.<eos> Or is it Mike Cormaneau?<eos> Can I talk to you guys?
"Oh, Grandmother, what large eyes you have!"<eos> "The better to see you with, my dear."<eos> "Oh, Grandmother, what large teeth you have!"<eos> "The better to devour you!"<eos> Welcome to story time.<eos> We're just getting started.<eos> I thought you were over at the magazines.<eos> They're old.<eos> I got bored.<eos> Okay, seriously, what is my uncle doing hanging out with you freaks?
What exactly are we dealing with?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I... I don't know.<eos> But I am hoping that by bringing the kids together, we can push everything out into the open.<eos> No more secrets.<eos> Do you promise us that they are going to be okay?<eos> I won't let anything happen to our kids.<eos> Let's get started.<eos> Agent Bennigan.<eos> Can I speak with you a moment?
I think they're talking about you.<eos> We're just here to talk.<eos> If any of this starts to feel uncomfortable, or just not good,<eos> then you tell me, and we'll stop, okay?<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's begin.<eos> But we've already talked to you.
Things I find and make myself, what's wrong with that?<eos> Nothing at all.<eos> How much for this?<eos> Well, that's not...<eos> - That don't belong to Alfons.<eos> - You don't say.<eos> I mean, I've no idea who put that there.<eos> Kembleford Boggart, perhaps?<eos> That must be a very gripping book because you haven't said a word for an hour or more.<eos> I am so proud of you, Father.
Why were you at my house?<eos> I think it's time you read some of your fan mail.<eos> This one from Belgium is particularly interesting.<eos> Hannah...<eos> You span a good story, Harry, and now it's time the truth comes out.<eos> I know you think you're trying to help the girl, but please, just let us go.<eos> She's made her choice.<eos> Hannah!<eos> Get in the car. She is a grieving woman who has been easily influenced.<eos> You have manipulated her into thinking that she is safe with you, while an innocent man may be sent to hang.
I like to keep it on the record.<eos> Abundance of caution.<eos> So you do buy drugs?<eos> Um, I'll be in the waiting room.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Is there a problem?<eos> - No.<eos> Not if you can use some Oxy, Vicodin, and I've got about 500 Illyria.<eos> Illyria?<eos> All the high without plugging you up.
If you could just write that down for me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, the light in here is so terrible, I'm worried I'm going to write the wrong name.<eos> Wow...<eos> Six minutes.<eos> I can't believe it took you this long to try to con your way out of prison.<eos> Fine, I'll give you the name.<eos> But I've been out of the game for a year.<eos> Markets change, aliases change.<eos> And no one's gonna talk to you.
Markets change, aliases change.<eos> And no one's gonna talk to you.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Constance here has been extremely helpful.<eos> I think our best option is to take her into the field with us.<eos> No, your best option is to not believe a word that she says.<eos> It's served me well for many years.<eos> It's only temporary.<eos> And we'll be supervising you the entire time.
Texts to hookers?<eos> Gambling habit?<eos> Drug use?<eos> You're certifiable.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll drop the article.<eos> I...<eos> I hear you're doing some remodeling.<eos> Shut up.<eos> You're here because you're still involved in an ongoing investigation, but everyone in the squad room is too afraid to have you near them.
- Uh, we don't have speakers.<eos> Patch it in the PA.<eos> Whoa, genius.<eos> I do my best thinking on the toilet, too.<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> We come with glad tidings.<eos> Ms. Peyton?<eos> We are sending you to a local hospice with a mountain of C-22.<eos> The two of you have been coloring outside the lines.<eos> Look, but you have to know, this facility cannot administer it to you.
No, it's not.<eos> How's his new job working out?<eos> Good, he's happy.<eos> Busy.<eos> Ah, Jackie, hi!<eos> Ah, come in.<eos> Come in.<eos> Do you like my baby condos?<eos> In real life, they will be much bigger.<eos> I need to talk to you.
Ah, very well. I apologize.<eos> Would you like to go to the ballet with me tonight?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> No, I'm not dating right now.<eos> Then you are free.<eos> That is to say available.<eos> Um, I... no.<eos> Wh... wha... let's face it, even if I was, you're basically the face of evil around here.<eos> Yes, but sometimes it's fun to go dating with the bad boy, no?<eos> Think it over and I'll check back with you.
You think you're going home, captain?<eos> I'm no longer a threat.<eos> I'm not connected to that rock anymore.<eos> That may be true, but...<eos> We have other considerations.<eos> What considerations, sir?<eos> We need to find out exactly what we're facing here.<eos> It seems you're the closest thing to an expert we've got.<eos> I told you everything I know.<eos> We believe there may be physiological aspects within your nervous system that allowed the enemy to communicate with you.
As I rode here, thinking on this... Situation, I have never felt more acutely the duty of the constitution, that which I swore to defend.<eos> Do you know the passage from the preamble?<eos> "We the people..."<eos> In order to secure the blessings of liberty "to ourselves and our posterity..."<eos> That's our descendants, Mr. Lawrence... our children.<eos> And that's on me now.<eos> If I may, sir, you're not alone.<eos> It's "we the people."<eos> And we are right here...<eos> With you...
Us.<eos> Let me see him.<eos> Let me talk him.<eos> I owe him that.<eos> You owe him that.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll make a call.<eos> Okay.<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> Just trying to talk to you.
Thank you.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> The waiting room is not thinning out.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> No man, woman, or child left behind.<eos> Thor, let us empty our coffers before we go.<eos> I have to admit, I wasn't expecting to be inspired at the end, by a doctor, no less, but thank you, Dr. Prince.<eos> I'm glad you're here.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Here's that otoscope you asked for.<eos> Dr. Prince, are you okay?
- Really.<eos> Mrs. Akalitus's son Michael is an addict.<eos> A young man with a string of arrests across the country.<eos> A son whom she abandoned.<eos> A son who... I don't know if you know this... is currently wanted on suspicion of grand larceny.<eos> Mr. Wolfe, is this going anywhere?<eos> Yes, ma'am, I promise you it is.<eos> Uh, I think what my lawyer's trying to say is that my supervisor cannot separate her personal life from my diversion program.<eos> Uh, "misplaced vendetta" is the term I would use.<eos> Please, I have been nothing but fair with you.
There's no way.<eos> We can't be 100% sure about anything, Benji, unless we see it with our own eyes.<eos> Well, where's the gun then?<eos> See, you don't get it, Sheriff.<eos> George didn't have no backbone.<eos> Ever since he was a little boy, you could see that.<eos> And there was nothing I could do to give him one neither.<eos> Well, I appreciate you talking with me under these circumstances.<eos> And, again, I'm awful sorry for your loss.<eos> I'd check in on Trey Willis if I was you.
What is he doing?<eos> I think he's drawing attention to himself.<eos> Hang on .<eos> You weren't called.<eos> I know, I'm just gonna be a second.<eos> This is a restricted area, kid.<eos> I just wanna see my friend.<eos> Can you let me through?<eos> Get your ass back in that chair.<eos> Just remember, you are always being monitored.
Just cover for me.<eos> I'll be back as soon as I can.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Teresa?<eos> It's Rachel.<eos> They took her the first night.<eos> I told her it was going to be okay.<eos> You sure this can't wait?<eos> She was very specific, sir.<eos> She wanted to speak with you personally.
Who's that?<eos> Stay back!<eos> Stay back!<eos> You guys look like shit.<eos> Come on .<eos> Follow me.<eos> U nless you want to stay here with them.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> Come on, keep up.<eos> Jorge wants to meet you.
I do enjoy hurting you.<eos> Talk!<eos> Talk!<eos> Okay!<eos> Jesus!<eos> But I'm not making any promises.<eos> These guys like to move around.<eos> They have an outpost in the mountains.<eos> But it's a long way away.<eos> You got half of WICKED on your ass.
Minho!<eos> Go!<eos> Come on!<eos> Minho!<eos> What do we do now?<eos> Well, we pick up what's left of us.<eos> We stick to the plan.<eos> We get you kids to the safe haven.<eos> Then we start over, I guess.<eos> I'm not going with you.
Previously on "Nurse Jackie"...<eos> Would you like to go to the ballet with me tonight?<eos> Thor: Dr. Prince, are you okay?
No, I was talking about not running into other human people.<eos> But I can see how keeping flowers safe is a priority for you.<eos> Your friend will like these, no?<eos> Who?<eos> Carrie.<eos> We are having... how do you say?<eos> A... a fling.<eos> That is not how we say.<eos> A sexual affair.<eos> She is not having any affair, sexual, with you.
Don't bring home such grades.<eos> Not to me.<eos> You're not an idiot or an airhead.<eos> But no lazybones here!<eos> Don't stare at me!<eos> You didn't even graduate!<eos> I married your mother.<eos> She was sick. And pregnant.<eos> I worked like a dog for you.<eos> Now I'm alone with you three and I'm sinking.
- Why can't you hear?<eos> The galloping hooves, the horsemen of the apocalypse!<eos> Okay, uh, get these people to head home.<eos> We'll take care of him.<eos> They're coming!<eos> Why can't you hear?<eos> I... I don't hear anything.<eos> Your tattoo...<eos> It's the lucky number seven, right?<eos> So I think you're gonna be fine.
I don't even know you.<eos> Nathan, look at this.<eos> These cards... they match the numbers under our wrists.<eos> Audrey's and Charlotte's too.<eos> The worst versions of these would be blindness, weakness,<eos> bad luck, and torture.<eos> Audrey,<eos> Charlotte, me, and you.<eos> Why are you doing this to us?<eos> I'm not doing anything to you.
- Got it.<eos> - Good.<eos> Load him up.<eos> Not too late to stop this side show.<eos> What are you afraid of, Bosch?<eos> Let's go solve some murders, Detective.<eos> Make some headlines?<eos> A video record is essential to this inquiry.<eos> We find any kill sites or graves, we're gonna need one.<eos> Sir, this is just another photo op, and I'm on the record with you here and now...
Very kind.<eos> Piss off!<eos> Now...<eos> This knocking, Margaret.<eos> How many at a time?<eos> Three.<eos> No.<eos> First it was in fours, then threes.<eos> I'm interviewing Margaret now, Janet.<eos> I'll do you later, if that's alright with you?
How do you do?<eos> I'm a colleague of yours at the SPR.<eos> Yes, yes, of course.<eos> I saw The Mirror.<eos> Thought maybe you could use a hand.<eos> Oh.<eos> Guy Playfair.<eos> Is that your real name or is that just for your books?<eos> For my books I use Guy Lyon Playfair.<eos> You play fair with me, I'll play fair with you!
Everyone was so kind.<eos> At the salon.<eos> They were fussing round me like I'd just come out of hospital.<eos> Then the questions started.<eos> How's Mr Grosses?<eos> How's he taking it?<eos> Did he know all along?<eos> Was he in on it?<eos> They're laughing at us, Maurice!<eos> They're laughing at you.
Oh, sorry, sir... Ow!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> It's all right.<eos> We were just having a bit of fun.<eos> We'll move on.<eos> Sorry I hit you.<eos> It felt good, though, eh?<eos> What's wrong with me?<eos> There's nothing wrong with you.
Sorry I hit you.<eos> It felt good, though, eh?<eos> What's wrong with me?<eos> There's nothing wrong with you.<eos> You've just got a poltergeist.<eos> No, before that.<eos> Everybody goes - Dad and Margaret and... you.<eos> Your dad going is not your fault.<eos> Him leaving is about him and your mum.<eos> It's nothing to do with you.
No.<eos> I don't forgive you.<eos> Because there's nothing to forgive.<eos> I'm tired.<eos> Is it OK if I go?<eos> Yes.<eos> We love you, me and your mum.<eos> I know.<eos> It's time to go.<eos> Janet... can you take everyone with you?
_<eos> I don't smoke, Jamie.<eos> What kind of club is this anyway?<eos> I don't know. I haven't been before.<eos> _<eos> Gracias.<eos> You got quite the wow factor here, Lee.<eos> This isn't what we agreed to. Not even half.<eos> Your fucking boss is trying to take over my nightclub with these equity and debt triggers.<eos> My boss, Mr. Stern, is just trying to form a partnership with you, that's all.
But sometimes we all just need a push...<eos> Bullshit, this contract's filled with all sorts of operational covenants.<eos> There's no way I meet all those restrictions.<eos> Now you see that?<eos> You gotta believe in yourself more.<eos> I have faith in you.<eos> Lee, come on, man, you are a visionary. You're a hard worker.<eos> Look at this place.<eos> This deal takes debt off the table while giving you more cash to grow your business.<eos> You get to retain day-to-day control.
- Then you know.<eos> - Know what?<eos> Once you get in bed with Stern, it's near impossible to get out.<eos> Just once, I'd like to beat the guy at his own game.<eos> Actually, I have a thought about that.<eos> Your landlord in this building, turns out he's been sued a couple of times, too.<eos> He's late on his mortgage again. If he defaults, the place goes up for auction.<eos> Simon Stern swoops in, he buys the place right up under his nose while stealing your dream.<eos> And then he'll have you by the balls forever.<eos> But if you and I work hard, man... and we put money away, then we can beat him to the punch.
And then he'll have you by the balls forever.<eos> But if you and I work hard, man... and we put money away, then we can beat him to the punch.<eos> But that's another conversation for another day.<eos> Right now... your John Hancock at the bottom of this contract.<eos> What do you say, Lee?<eos> You're good.<eos> You know that.<eos> There's no way Stern's letting you go without a fight.<eos> Well, I sure as hell am looking forward to it.<eos> Nice doing business with you.
You're out of the system.<eos> You know Vinci PD.<eos> Properly motivated, you're a good bet to get the dirt.<eos> Think it over, Velcoro.<eos> Never too late to start all over again.<eos> You let me keep my kid, I'm in.<eos> Get started. You're on the clock.<eos> I want daily reports.<eos> Wasn't it you who thought I was the worst of these people?<eos> Saw that rumor about you killing a guy was bullshit.
It'll be between five and six million.<eos> I'd rather split the total among more stones.<eos> They don't all need to be that high-end.<eos> But I'll need the exchange to happen fast.<eos> Then it is not about the stones.<eos> It is about the money behind the stones.<eos> You are changing money you are not supposed to have.<eos> We do not engage in such practices.<eos> The money will be untraceable in itself.<eos> Abner Ehrman told me I could work with you.
We got a gas leak spilling into the AC.<eos> Need to clear the place for three hours or so.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Just fucking do it.<eos> Everybody out.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, due to a sudden safety issue, we need to request that you cash out your chips and vacate the premises.<eos> These tunnels exist under the entire city.<eos> Most people don't know that.<eos> The pictures of you two were a happy coincidence we came across when clearing Detective Dixon's apartment.<eos> Apparently he was keeping an eye on you.
Frank?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Shit.<eos> I've been watching you, miss.<eos> You know, I said to myself, now there is a real woman.<eos> Not like these little girls.<eos> Oh, they try to make like they understand, but it's just empty eyes.<eos> You see, for me, it's just as much about the dialogue.<eos> I could talk to you all day about the oil business, but I'm sure you'd like to do something else.
What do you fancy?<eos> Chicken and veg or pizza?<eos> Alright then.<eos> - Let me do it.<eos> - No, I'll do it.<eos> No.<eos> I'll do it and then go.<eos> No. I prefer to do it.<eos> At least I know it'll be done properly.<eos> You didn't burp her last time.
Again, rude.<eos> It's family money passed down from my father.<eos> But money isn't everything, Bart, especially when you don't have anyone to share it with.<eos> You don't have any family?<eos> I did once, but not anymore.<eos> Now it's just me and John Amos.<eos> He used to serve Malcolm, my father.<eos> John Amos, the polaroid.<eos> Ah.<eos> Can I have a picture with you?
-Now!<eos> Boys!<eos> Can I get another photo?<eos> Stand right there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This will be much better.<eos> It's just darling.<eos> I guess.<eos> I'm going to keep this.<eos> I want to see more of you in person.
Hello, dear.<eos> I've come back.<eos> So it was you at the recital.<eos> I want you to stay away from my children and leave us the hell alone!<eos> Cathy, I may never get another chance to say this--<eos> I prayed!<eos> I prayed that you had died.<eos> I prayed that you'd died in that nut farm!<eos> Oh, Cathy, if only you knew how it hurts to hear you say those things after all these years.<eos> I only came here to be near you.
Chocolate was always my downfall.<eos> Milk chocolate, not the dark stuff they say is better for you.<eos> I can order something else.<eos> No, no, it's good to try new things.<eos> Get out of the comfort zone.<eos> Yes, we get caught up in what we're doing... who we think we are.<eos> So... who are you, Wilson?<eos> Tonight, I'm just a man... enjoying the company of a captivating woman.<eos> I told you he's indisposed.<eos> Sir, I need to speak with you.
Wait.<eos> What?<eos> She liked my style, so I'm gonna be her new personal shopper.<eos> So you're gonna be working here?<eos> And living here, too.<eos> You can't get rid of me that easy, sis.<eos> You gave Reina a job?<eos> Your sister's going through a very difficult time right now.<eos> Genevieve!<eos> She's manipulating you.
Okay, that's...true.<eos> But I really am glad you're here.<eos> You tricked me into coming back so I'd get rid of Reina.<eos> But she's a very nice person.<eos> And I won't do it.<eos> I'm not your puppet.<eos> Okay, this is what Reina does.<eos> She turns people against each other.<eos> She told me you'd say that.<eos> She's taking advantage of you.
[ Sighs ] But let's just say you quit.<eos> Mm. Mm-hmm. That's better.<eos> Are you okay with this?<eos> Yeah. I can find another job.<eos> But before I hang up my mop, what kind of severance are you offering?<eos> Well, there are several packages.<eos> Okay.<eos> But the one I have in mind for you has some excellent benefits.<eos> There she is -- our newest star.<eos> I need to talk to you.
Poor thing. You were worried, too?<eos> No.<eos> You kept calling me.<eos> Genevieve, thank you for coming in today.<eos> Of course, Doctor.<eos> And you brought a guest.<eos> This is Zoila, my dearest friend in the world/housekeeper.<eos> It's weird, but it works.<eos> Well, I'm sure it does.<eos> It's just that, Genevieve, I was hoping to talk to you alone.
And how do you know?<eos> Well, he was involved with a friend of mine.<eos> As I recall, it was a... tempestuous romance with a very ugly breakup.<eos> Really?<eos> This friend of yours, what's her name?<eos> Hello, I'm Detective Figueroa.<eos> Beverly Hills police.<eos> Are you Genevieve Delatour? Yes.<eos> What this about?<eos> I need to speak to you about the murder of Louie Becker.
Well, i imagine he must be very handsome.<eos> You wouldn't be dating a troll.<eos> Shut it, dog!<eos> Now, that's more like it.<eos> And, mistress, please don't be gentle.<eos> Oh, how thoughtful.<eos> You brought me lunch.<eos> Genevieve, i'm worried about you.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You're a person of interest in a murder investigation.
Genevieve, i'm worried about you.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You're a person of interest in a murder investigation.<eos> That's not fine.<eos> Oh, well.<eos> It'll blow over.<eos> Come on.<eos> You're freaking out.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> What went on between you and louie?
Not even a little.<eos> [ laughter ]<eos> Ah. Good afternoon, mrs.<eos> Powell. Hello...<eos> You. Forgive me, but i've been asking around, And i understand you were friends with louie becker.<eos> Good friends.<eos> I still can't believe he's gone.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah. So tragic.<eos> Did he ever share a video with you of a... Sexual nature?
Thank you. If there's anything I can ever do to return...<eos> There is.<eos> Whatever made Taylor do this, please don't let it happen again.<eos> [Gasps] Adrian?<eos> Oh, my God! Did you get my message?<eos> The paramedics think Mr. Powell had some kind of seizure.<eos> Is he gonna be all right?<eos> He's stable for now.<eos> They'll run more tests at the hospital.<eos> I'm coming with you.
What's so important?<eos> Your private investigator.<eos> Mr. Dresden?<eos> Well, it wasn't easy, but I managed to track down Deion's birth father.<eos> Ooh, right.<eos> Uh, turns out I no longer need that information.<eos> - So what should I tell him?<eos> - Nothing. I don't want anything to do with that man.<eos> Well, that's unfortunate, because he's sitting right across from me.<eos> And he's eager to meet you.
And who's your little guest?<eos> This is Deion, my... foster child.<eos> Oh, I-I know children aren't allowed in the dining room, but...<eos> No, it's not a problem.<eos> I think what you're doing is wonderful.<eos> And what am I doing, exactly?<eos> Well, becoming a foster parent.<eos> Last year, my husband and I adopted a baby girl from Vietnam.<eos> How liberal of you.<eos> Well, I hope we'll be seeing more of you and your beautiful family.
You're a big boy.<eos> Hold it.<eos> Why are we at the park?<eos> Don't you have to go to the bathroom?<eos> Ay. Spence?<eos> I'll just be a moment, Natalie.<eos> Why don't you have a seat?<eos> Uh, where's Mr. Powell?<eos> Upstairs.<eos> He's, uh, so looking forward to meeting you.
Harley wilkes died, actually.<eos> You know what? Forget it, it's a long story.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> I don't like long stories.<eos> Anyway, since you're here, Can you deliver this contract to dr. Breeland?<eos> What is this?<eos> What... He's not hiring a new associate.<eos> Yes, he is.<eos> No, he's not.<eos> Okay, i don't even know how to talk to you people.
You haven't told anybody else?<eos> No, you asked me not to.<eos> But this is grand theft, so I'm thinking I should go pick him up.<eos> Let me talk to him first, please.<eos> I don't want him shamed.<eos> I just want him to admit to what he's done.<eos> And when I'm done talking to him, I hope you'll talk to me.<eos> Well, I'm gonna for sure want to hear about that afterwards.<eos> No, I mean I hope you'll talk to me.<eos> I'm always happy to talk to you, father.
But he's offering to tell us about all his victims.<eos> We found at least seven DNA profiles in Waits' van...<eos> Six male, one female.<eos> Now, this is an opportunity to identify those victims, - and to give closure to those families...<eos> - Closure's a myth.<eos> Well, that's for the families to decide, isn't it, Detective?<eos> Why am I here?<eos> Interview Waits.<eos> See if he's telling the truth about killing this kid.<eos> Johnson and Moore will give you what they have.
O'Shea's elected mayor, Irving never makes chief.<eos> Never knew you had such a nose for politics, Jerry.<eos> Fuck you, Harry.<eos> Your full name, birth date, and place of birth?<eos> Raynard Waits.<eos> No middle name.<eos> Born November 3, 1971, - in the City of Angels.<eos> - You mean Los Angeles.<eos> Los Angeles.<eos> You know, Detective Bosch, you and I met before, years ago.
I'll take it off your hands, but you're not getting your deposit back.<eos> Unacceptable.<eos> I need that money to pursue my dream of stardom.<eos> That's the most pathetic thing I've ever heard.<eos> And I have sex with these costumes at night.<eos> - Mrs. Voorhees. - Mm?<eos> - Um... - Not now, Kimmy.<eos> In preparation for Julian's return, I went to the gyno-dermatologist.<eos> I need to lie down with my feet and heart above my vagina.<eos> Uh, but I really need to talk to you about your stepdaughter.
That's right.<eos> Look...<eos> I'm responsible.<eos> I'm responsible for every bad thing that happened to my family.<eos> I won't let you soothe your conscience by copping to a crime you didn't commit.<eos> Did she?<eos> Did she do it?<eos> I got probable cause up the wazoo.<eos> Miss Delacroix?<eos> We need to speak to you.
Um, I'll bring you back in.<eos> Go get a coffee.<eos> Go ahead, Frank.<eos> Your father's no longer being charged with your brother's murder.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I thought he confessed.<eos> He de-confessed.<eos> He didn't kill Arthur.<eos> Your father thought you killed Arthur.<eos> He was going to take the weight because of what he did to you.
Rochefort knows everything about you and the queen.<eos> Get out of the way.<eos> The King is not accepting visitors.<eos> This is not a visitor, it's the Queen.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Do as he says.<eos> How dare you defy me!<eos> Open the doors or we'll kill you and open them ourselves.<eos> You dare bring an armed guard into my presence!<eos> ~ I must speak with you, sire.
I will never forget his smile when we landed.<eos> That's like, wow...<eos> Have some.<eos> There's been an accident.<eos> I am so happy that Jipé had a boyfriend.<eos> I thought he was all alone.<eos> No, we...<eos> Yvan.<eos> We have... Buck Danny and I have this awesome idea.<eos> He could come with you, do the ceremony in Los Angeles.
He's afraid of flying!<eos> Wim!<eos> Are you OK?<eos> - What is this?<eos> - Did you take those?<eos> - Wim.<eos> - Did you take those?<eos> Wim?<eos> Too bad Jipé didn't introduce us.<eos> I'd always wanted to meet you, Yvan.
Of course, Dr. Adams.<eos> But your nurse didn't indicate what this meeting was about.<eos> That's because she doesn't know.<eos> I'm still H.I.V. Negative, right?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> But -- I have cancer.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> No, you're in perfect health.<eos> The reason I wanted to talk to you in person is because --
[ Car door closes ] Scott: Look, I'm just telling you what she told me.<eos> Gene Kelly had the hots for grandma.<eos> I'm not kidding.<eos> And apparently, it was her legs that sent him over the edge. Hey.<eos> The woman had great gams.<eos> I'll drink to that.<eos> Woman had great gams.<eos> Well, you're a good grandson, keeping your grandma's tall tales alive.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, tell me -- what's going on with you two?
Aha!<eos> Aha?<eos> Savi did book a trip with us.<eos> Where, Phyllis?<eos> Where?<eos> Australia, two years ago.<eos> A getaway for her and Harry.<eos> So, with the reviews the way they are, I plan on being way overbooked.<eos> Whoa, there he is, chef Harry Davis -- the man, the myth, the legend.<eos> Pleasure to meet you, sir.
Oh, yeah -- sorry. Sorry.<eos> Do you want me to take you to the tow yard or what?<eos> 'Kay.<eos> Oh, who hung this here?<eos> Uh, I did, chef.<eos> Thought it might inspire you.<eos> Thanks, mate.<eos> [ Crying ] You okay?<eos> I just wanted to say what an honor...<eos> It was working with you, chef.
Wilson loves me.<eos> More than my husband ever did.<eos> Just breathe.<eos> And then she gave me this candle... cinnamon and clove... which is seasonal, which means she just had it lying around.<eos> So, she's just spending the day at your place... Alone?<eos> Well, what can I do?<eos> I have to work.<eos> Things get really busy around lunchtime.<eos> Look, I get it.<eos> - After what happened between you two...
Mom, we had a nice day. Let's not mess it up, okay?<eos> I understand why you're upset.<eos> I do. But...<eos> I think you're making this into something bigger than it needs to be.<eos> Of course you think that.<eos> Nothing is ever a big deal to you.<eos> Well, that's not true.<eos> But according to your daughter, everything is always a big deal to you.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - And that, honey, is just adding to the tension that you two already have.
A toast!<eos> No, sir, this is a private toast.<eos> Thank you.<eos> To my ladies.<eos> No, to you.<eos> To your freedom.<eos> Shh!<eos> My toast!<eos> Thank you, guys, for all the care packages and the letters that came every day.<eos> Words can't express how amazing it is to just be standing here with you.
It's a common hazard with transplants.<eos> Vivian?<eos> Please look at me.<eos> We will fix this.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> So, what's the plan?<eos> Up her cyclosporine?<eos> And put her on prednisone, yeah.<eos> And what stage is she in?<eos> This is actually what I called you in to discuss.
Mrs. Vanderwaal asked us to search the house again, and we found this.<eos> There were three cameras.<eos> This is the only relevant one.<eos> Mona put them in herself.<eos> The batteries ran down months ago, but they were working on Thanksgiving.<eos> Is there anything about the attacker that in any way is familiar to you?<eos> Do you recognize anything about that person?<eos> It could be my sister.<eos> It could be Alison.<eos> How could it be your sister if Alison was with you and your father when the incident occurred?
Roll up the windows.<eos> - Stop!<eos> - Can you go a little faster?<eos> Please, Ove, no one is going to ticket you at a hospital.<eos> It's only going to take fifteen minutes.<eos> He's in for observation.<eos> I'm going in, so we'll meet here later, OK?<eos> - Wait a second.<eos> What about the children?<eos> - They'll have to stay with you.
- Bye, Ove!<eos> Intercity 3214 is passing on track 3.<eos> Come help, for fuck's sake!<eos> Are you stupid?<eos> Give me your hand.<eos> Give me your hand now!<eos> Come on, dammit!<eos> Are you an idiot?<eos> Dad!<eos> What is it with you?
It's about the accident at the train station.<eos> You saved a man's life there.<eos> - You're wrong, that wasn't me.<eos> - I was there and saw it all.<eos> We have a series called "The Invisible Heroes".<eos> I think you would be a good fit.<eos> I'm sure a lot of exciting things happened in your life.<eos> - Will you talk about it?<eos> - No.<eos> I have a letter from the man you saved.
If you're done with your neanderthal manners then we'll probably get along.<eos> - Move.<eos> - Never.<eos> Go back, get lost.<eos> If you have a problem with us driving here, call the administrator at the municipality.<eos> - You can help Rune in other ways.<eos> - I don't give a shit about Rune.<eos> Driving in here isn't permitted.<eos> Not another meter.<eos> What is it with you really, Ove?
I've never gotten drunk and done something completely irresponsible.<eos> Hey, you got your prescription pad on you?<eos> That could be fun. I've never even tried marijuana.<eos> - Weed?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Come in.<eos> Mr. Gallagher.<eos> This won't take long.<eos> I called Financial Aid. They contradicted your assertion that your bill was a slight hiccup.<eos> - They've been trying to get in touch with you.
Fuck you!<eos> Something else I need to do.<eos> You coming?<eos> Hi.<eos> Baby, what happened?<eos> Boys hit me. Called me rat.<eos> Uncle Carl told them.<eos> - Bitch hit Carl.<eos> - Looks like he gave as good as he got.<eos> V, this thing with you and Kev, is it temporary?
And if she can't be trusted, I can't force her to reveal things she doesn't want to.<eos> You convinced me to make the deal with her in the first place.<eos> We needed information.<eos> She had access.<eos> And now she's lying to us.<eos> Maybe you should speak with her before we consider this a crisis.<eos> I don't like your tone, Remy.<eos> - You're blowing this out of proportion.<eos> - Watch yourself.<eos> When I worked for you in Congress, you always told me to be straight up with you.
All right, even if that's true, you should attack her for using the hurricane to score sympathy points.<eos> I've discussed it with my staff.<eos> This isn't just your campaign, Jackie, this is our campaign.<eos> May I offer you some advice, sir?<eos> Sign the bill.<eos> If you don't, and the storm hits, you and I won't have a campaign.<eos> You should get back to your dinner.<eos> Hey, everyone.<eos> Let's put down the dishes for a second.<eos> I need to talk to you.
- That wasn't my point.<eos> I wouldn't take a bullet for a man who was.<eos> Let's go, your car's waiting.<eos> As of tomorrow, Congresswoman Sharp and I are suspending our campaigns.<eos> We will be traveling to areas affected by Hurricane Faith, along with our campaign staff, in order to volunteer in whatever capacity is most helpful.<eos> We're also suspending any donations, and urge our supporters to donate to the Red Cross and other hurricane relief agencies.<eos> In times of suffering, it's important to suspend politics and do what's best for the country.<eos> We look forward to resuming our campaigns when the storm has cleared and the people of the east coast are safe.<eos> Freddy?<eos> The President would like to see you, Mr. Hayes.
Whoa, slow down.<eos> You never used this guy before?<eos> I never asked if there was any questions.<eos> I actually have the same question.<eos> And that's your last question.<eos> This is my last answer.<eos> The connection I know, he's my man.<eos> He's never used this method to bring in stuff before.<eos> Juan's going with you.<eos> See, I don't care what happens to you clowns, but Juan...
Did you tell Salazar?<eos> What?<eos> Was it you, whalen?<eos> You stupid Mick.<eos> Put the gun down, Joe.<eos> We'll kill that bottle.<eos> I could use a drink.<eos> Stand down, stand down, stand down.<eos> I love being a cop.<eos> I love workin' with you.
I have good and bad news.<eos> Bad news: you won't work the same shifts as Karine.<eos> Good news: I got you a 3 month fixed-term contract, renewable after a trial period.<eos> Nothing going in sales?<eos> Like selling beds, sofas, kitchens?<eos> My training was in sales.<eos> You don't understand, Eddie.<eos> Usually the recruitment process is carried out in stages.<eos> I only agreed to see you so quickly because I like Karine and we all appreciate her.<eos> She told us what happened to you.
Can I borrow your dress for the day?<eos> Of course.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'll go get changed and then come back and help you.<eos> ...So Budarin comes back with:<eos> 'The war in Spain has shown us' 'that the era of waving around swords is over.'<eos> And Vedernikov just loses it, grabs his sword and starts chasing him.<eos> Lucky that he couldn't catch him.<eos> I'll wait outside for you.<eos> I'll just change and then be with you.
I passed, top of my class.<eos> Well done.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You could be proud of me.<eos> Misha, try to be gentler with her today.<eos> ...not only in our country...<eos> Dad, what time are you back?<eos> Dad?<eos> By dinner, but don't wait for me.<eos> We wanted to invite the neighbours around to dinner, to celebrate the good news, with you.
Ladies, hey.<eos> - Really sorry.<eos> - Our sincerest apologies.<eos> We're so sorry, it was an accident.<eos> Let us make it up to you, please.<eos> It's okay, Maria's forgiven you, and forgotten.<eos> You can go boys.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - One sec.<eos> Maria, very pleased to meet you.
Maria, we're going swimming.<eos> Attention, danger, please swim back at once.<eos> Can I sit?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I recognised you at once.<eos> And what do you...<eos> What did Sonya tell you about me?<eos> She said that I should shave, wear some cologne, iron my trousers and polish my shoes.<eos> Then to speak to you on the beach and make a good impression.
No, she also said that I should take a look at you in your bathing suit, and realise that I need to marry you at once.<eos> And did you realise?<eos> Boris.<eos> Lyudmila.<eos> - Well, if we're being serious, then...<eos> - They're pilots!<eos> I need time to decide.<eos> Yes, a very interesting book Lyuda.<eos> Ah, so it's Lyuda?<eos> Pleased to meet you.
- They're pilots!<eos> I need time to decide.<eos> Yes, a very interesting book Lyuda.<eos> Ah, so it's Lyuda?<eos> Pleased to meet you.<eos> - Lyudmila.<eos> - Maria.<eos> As we promised, we'd like to invite you to celebrate our victory with us.<eos> Since he's here, the young gentleman can also join us.<eos> I can't agree with you there.
And if Porthos fails to capture him, hm?<eos> Or he refuses to speak?<eos> What then?<eos> And what about Aramis?<eos> Milady is the only one who can still get into the palace.<eos> She has to help him.<eos> HE SIGHS<eos> Get some rest.<eos> We leave to help Porthos as soon as night falls.<eos> ~ I'm coming with you.
HE GRUNTS<eos> ~ I will never betray my country.<eos> ~ You already have.<eos> ~ What do you mean?<eos> ~ Does King Philip want to see his own sister murdered?<eos> Rochefort intends to kill her.<eos> She may only be hours away from her execution.<eos> The King loves his sister.<eos> If she dies, he'll want revenge.<eos> And he'll come to you first.
The King loves his sister.<eos> If she dies, he'll want revenge.<eos> And he'll come to you first.<eos> Rochefort was never told to harm the Queen.<eos> He's a monster of your making.<eos> He is no monster.<eos> But he is mine.<eos> Give evidence against Rochefort and you save the Queen.<eos> If you run, she dies.<eos> So do you.
Leave only the King's Guard inside.<eos> Go!<eos> Go!<eos> COMMOTION, SHOUTING<eos> VARGAS:<eos> Where are all the guards?<eos> With such poor protection, no wonder France falters.<eos> ~ There are no servants.<eos> Courtiers. ~ I must go to the Queen!<eos> I'll go with you.
You left me no choice.<eos> SWORDS CLANG<eos> Surrender.<eos> HE ROARS<eos> BLADE SLICES SLICING HE PANTS<eos> METAL SCRAPES METAL SCRAPES HE GROANS AND PANTS<eos> HE PANTS<eos> Liars.<eos> Yours are the lies, Rochefort.<eos> And they will join you in your grave.
- Nobody's getting shot.<eos> - Hood.<eos> - Now, there's a voice of reason.<eos> - And you are?<eos> - Sheriff Lucas Hood.<eos> Sheriff.<eos> Well, then, Sheriff Hood, do you have a solution in mind?<eos> We're only here for the woman.<eos> And Mr. Proctor?<eos> Whatever's going on between you and him, that's your business.
Look, I'm sure you've noticed my work situation isn't the liveliest.<eos> When I unwind, I like some feel-it-in-your-bones audio.<eos> I'm assuming at this price, the tip is included.<eos> Talk to your boss if you have any problems with that.<eos> It's kind of insult to injury, huh?<eos> He turns you into a zombie and then charges you an arm and a leg for brains.<eos> Are you trying to be funny?<eos> No.<eos> I'm trying to tell you I have empathy for your cause.<eos> Let me share something with you, Jackie.
Actually, I think of them as unfair reviews.<eos> As unfair as yours?<eos> They like to sling demeaning nicknames, don't they?<eos> Tooth Fairy.<eos> What could be more inappropriate?<eos> It would shame me for you to see that, if I didn't know that you have suffered the same distortions in the press.<eos> You've read Freddie Lounds' latest?<eos> It's not a good picture of you.<eos> Your speech is bent and pruned by disabilities, real and imagined, but... your words are startling.<eos> I want to be recognised by you.
Your dad has enough to worry about without worrying if I'm going to poison the dogs again.<eos> I'm not fortune's fool...<eos> I'm yours.<eos> "Behold the Great Red Dragon."<eos> And did you?<eos> The Brooklyn Museum is closed to the public on Tuesdays, but researchers are admitted.<eos> You knew that's when we'd both be going.<eos> A sophisticated intelligence can forecast many things.<eos> I suppose mine is sophisticated enough.<eos> He's contacted you.
I wanted you to go.<eos> I told you to go.<eos> Nobody to blame but myself.<eos> And Jack Crawford.<eos> I do blame Jack Crawford.<eos> Jack knew what he was doing.<eos> And so did I.<eos> Is he after you now?<eos> Is that why he came after us?<eos> He came after you because Hannibal suggested it.
It needn't be for long.<eos> The government assures us, if and when they begin, hostilities could be over by Christmas.<eos> Madam President.<eos> Few who lived through the last conflict will set much store by government assurances that any war against Germany will be over swiftly.<eos> Mrs Barden - - When war does begin, it will hurl us all into a period of great change.<eos> Something you, Madam President, have proven steadfastly resistant to over the course of your term in office.<eos> Mrs Collingborne, would you kindly control your sister?<eos> As you know, Madam President, that isn't as straightforward as you imply.<eos> Ooh. Can you help me up?<eos> Blimey... what happened to you?
I want you to be friends.<eos> Honey, I don't think we should be friends with Drill anymore.<eos> Why can't you just tell me what the message is?<eos> Drill says it's a secret message just for you. If you do what the letters say, he'll give you what you want.<eos> - What is it, Mommy?<eos> Is it fun?<eos> - No. No, honey, it's not fun.<eos> Ever.<eos> Mr. Harcourt?<eos> Yes? We'd like to speak with you about your son.
But I knew.<eos> I knew what would happen if Drill sent that signal out.<eos> Oh, she stopped again.<eos> 217 Spruce Street, same as Sean and Claire. - How far out are we?<eos> - Three minutes.<eos> Thomas, does Drill still speak to you?<eos> The doctors said I just stopped hearing the whispers because the medication was working.<eos> But you and I know better.<eos> We know better about what?<eos> When did he stop talking to you?
We know better about what?<eos> When did he stop talking to you?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Thomas, we are here because we wanna help our son.<eos> We want Drill to leave him alone, and anything that you can tell us Drill is talking to your son?<eos> And other kids, too.<eos> No, that's not possible.<eos> That...<eos> They must've sent another one to find us.<eos> What... what if he followed you? - Thomas...
Just ignore him!<eos> Freak!<eos> Mr Parker?<eos> I understand you saw the Jeep leave the resort?<eos> Yes, er, about 7.40.<eos> You didn't see the driver?<eos> The driver?<eos> But it was Shelly.<eos> We have good reason to think it wasn't.<eos> ~ Was anyone with you when you saw it? ~ Er... yeah.
Proof is proof. We've nothing to worry about.<eos> Now go and enjoy yourself.<eos> Pull up a chair.<eos> I said a chair, not a stool:<eos> a chair with arms.<eos> Only kings sit by His Majesty in a chair with arms.<eos> You are more than a king.<eos> You are my friend.<eos> I would like to hear stories about your son.<eos> In his last hours, he asked me to tell him about my life with you.
Prince Annaba, in France, we do the things in a different way.<eos> Had I made a mistake?<eos> Should I speak to the Dutchmen, to the Spanish, to the Englishmen?<eos> All are inclined to discuss the future.<eos> Don't you appreciate our hospitality?<eos> How can I not appreciate it?<eos> And it is not finished.<eos> You will see it this evening.<eos> What will happen?<eos> I will sit down with you.
We have both.<eos> Why to bring me here?<eos> - To finish our negotiations.<eos> - We do not have...<eos> We were negotiating since you had arrived.<eos> You do not give the choice to me.<eos> I give you security and equitable incomes, as well as cannonry to protect your harbour.<eos> You left a long time ago. Your enemies threaten your capital.<eos> My father will protect it.<eos> Do you see this creature, full of life, in front of you?
Janet wants to stay home with the twins, and I think this would make that possible.<eos> You're starting a...<eos> you're starting a coup.<eos> - No, okay, stop.<eos> Please stop saying that.<eos> - Starting a coup.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, look, just ask her.<eos> Well, you know, I-I don't want it to get weird between me and her, so I was hoping that you could ask her, - that way if she wants... - Ooh-hoo-hoo!<eos> - I'm not getting in between you two.
You come on up if you're able to.<eos> I have a young, healthy patient in a-fib, cardiac markers and electrolytes look normal.<eos> She's been given three rounds of beta blockers plus Amiodarone, and she's just getting worse.<eos> - Look at her BP.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> That's after 15 of Metoprolol.<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> There was no chest trauma.<eos> Let's go... strip and flip.<eos> Hey, Sandra, we're gonna figure out what's going on with you, okay?
Getting some privacy.<eos> Well, your lab results came back.<eos> They show very high levels of marijuana.<eos> Could have told you that.<eos> S-so why didn't you?<eos> You made me look like an idiot in front of my boss.<eos> You did that to yourself.<eos> You saw an old lady and never thought of the possibility, though I was exhibiting all of the behavior.<eos> Look, I-I-I need to tell your son.<eos> He's been all over me about what's wrong with you.
Okay.<eos> Well, Molly doesn't cause memory loss, so I'd like to run a tox screen to see if we can identify what you may have taken.<eos> Okay. Hang in there.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay, let's run the tox screen and see if it'll tell us something that she won't, okay?<eos> - Rick.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - It's Dr Chavez.<eos> - Hey. Good to meet you.<eos> - Nice to meet you.
Is everything okay?<eos> Yeah, it's fine.<eos> Here, let me take a look... no, no, no.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Krista took care of it.<eos> She did?<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> So, how long have you been here?<eos> Uh, he's got a seroma I need to aspirate, actually.<eos> Dr Chavez, Topher needs to speak to you about the base jumper's health proxy and DNR.
Well, I hope it's a good home.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Uh, I heard what you did earlier.<eos> It's nice to know there's still a few good guys left in the world.<eos> There better be.<eos> I, uh... I have a sister.<eos> Lorelei, have you thought about filing a complaint?<eos> This happens to so many women at school, and nobody takes them seriously.<eos> You just... Never think it's gonna happen to you.<eos> Look, it's your call, but I will go with you to the Dean, the police, whatever you want.
You just... Never think it's gonna happen to you.<eos> Look, it's your call, but I will go with you to the Dean, the police, whatever you want.<eos> And so will I.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - And I know that this doesn't make things right, but, um, I called a friend of mine at the local rape crisis center.<eos> They have all the resources... both medical and legal.<eos> If you choose to move forward.<eos> If you're not ready, it's okay.<eos> But if you are, I'm free this afternoon.<eos> I could take you if you like.
- Uh, I slipped a disk last year...<eos> - I don't care why you took it.<eos> Do not take any more.<eos> This dope is tainted.<eos> It will kill you.<eos> Do you need a number to a rehab facility?<eos> I... Messed up.<eos> Won't happen again.<eos> All right, well, just stay here.<eos> We'll keep an eye on you, make sure you're okay.
- Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> I got a pulse.<eos> Paul, your hail mary might have just saved him.<eos> Now let's get him on that chopper.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, Carla's awake.<eos> Go.<eos> It's okay. I got you. Hey, I got you, okay?
Let's let the surgery team finish this up.<eos> It's him.<eos> My guardian angel.<eos> That's one nice-sized angel.<eos> Glad you got your wing fixed.<eos> He was my only family.<eos> I can't believe he did this.<eos> Was it to help pay for my school?<eos> No.<eos> It had nothing to do with you.
Yeah.<eos> Man: And 3, 2...<eos> I'm here with Dr. Drew Alister, the hero who risked his own life to stop the shooting from happening just a few days ago.<eos> Can you tell us about it, doctor?<eos> I just did what any other soldier would do.<eos> It just happened to be me, but I firmly believe that the men and women I served with would've done the same thing.<eos> My partner, Rick...<eos> Would've done the same thing, as well.<eos> I was just trying to do what was right.<eos> And this man sitting next to you, your partner, army captain Rick Lincoln.
She's just efficient.<eos> That's... impressive.<eos> And it's good that your mom knows her stuff.<eos> It makes our job a lot easier.<eos> So, Dr. Cummings, what would you suggest?<eos> Yeah, actually, I... what she... what she said.<eos> Also, I would order a chest X-ray and set him up for breathing treatments.<eos> Excellent.<eos> I'll leave you to it.<eos> It was nice to meet you both.
This has to be genetic, which means she's had it her whole life.<eos> Her cortisol levels are barely detectable.<eos> You know, maybe that's why she didn't want a C.T.<eos> She didn't want us to know that she was dying.<eos> Why would she want to hide that?<eos> Yeah, that's a good question.<eos> Hello?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Thank you for calling, sir.<eos> I wanted to speak with you directly about your son.
They don't hate me because of what I have.<eos> They hate me for what I do.<eos> The current regime is so corrupt that only men with resources can make difference.<eos> So I fund opposition parties, I bankroll newspapers critical of the government.<eos> I even pay for a limousine to drive round Red Square with billboards on the roof, denouncing the President as a crook and a terrorist.<eos> And you're paying the price now?<eos> You tell me.<eos> My apologies, Mr Milton.<eos> I should have contacted you at work.<eos> But I wanted to talk to you alone.
Now they're begging to invest in us and you just want to walk away from it!<eos> I don't want that life any more.<eos> I want a normal life, the life we never had - me, Maksim, Anastacia, maybe kids of our own.<eos> No-one could have done what we've done, Yas.<eos> We were kids, we had nothing, and now we've got all this.<eos> Yeah, and does it make you happy?<eos> It made us both happy.<eos> Why can't you give me your blessing?<eos> Look, I love you... and I would never want to do anything to hurt you, but things have changed.<eos> What are you going to do when they come after you in the US?
For fuck's sakes!<eos> Let 'em go!<eos> Okay.<eos> Fine, fine.<eos> Sergeant... Get the girls off.<eos> Let's go, move it!<eos> Just get back in the air before Infinite Wisdom turns this entire country into a smoldering heap.<eos> Dear Lord... clearly, these girls are not your chosen.<eos> I mean, they did come from that loser Talbot.<eos> Alex Talbot is not with you?
I can tell.<eos> It can never be between us.<eos> I know.<eos> - So...<eos> - So? Come with me.<eos> We are told not to play with fire, but they enjoy it.<eos> I see no merit in it, no skill.<eos> Oh I don't know.<eos> A little burning is good for the soul, don't you think?<eos> Joan of Arc might disagree with you, or Lucifer.
You really are "fancy".<eos> Innis, bring Joe in here and increase security outside.<eos> Leave him!<eos> He doesn't know anything!<eos> He's not talking, but Kristana's been picking up some chatter.<eos> A lot of buzz about stolen Company tech.<eos> - They're calling it a weapon.<eos> - What the hell are you two - planning to do?<eos> - Don't be an idiot.<eos> Kill a Rack agent and they'll come for all of you.
That would just be a waste of the last 20 years of your life.<eos> Makes sense.<eos> Help!<eos> Help!<eos> You're too stupid to play with.<eos> Uh, th-the saw.<eos> Fetch the saw.<eos> Really?<eos> Here's what we know.<eos> Ford robbed a bank with you and another associate.
You fit the size and description.<eos> But you were smart enough to put on gloves and a mask.<eos> And you were lucky enough to have Ford as your partner.<eos> Man did an extra ten years he could have avoided just by rolling on you.<eos> Okay, here's the offer.<eos> You're gonna tell us everything...<eos> Who Ford hated, who hated Ford, who he trusted, what he told you, the last time you spoke, what he told you every time you spoke.<eos> And you might as well tell us now, because one, we are not gonna use any of it against you.<eos> Today only, we don't give a crap about a bank robbery that happened 20 years ago.<eos> And two, until our detective is found, there is gonna be a cop following you everywhere you go and another cop listening in.

It was a good idea.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Are you Dale Barbara?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Christine Price.<eos> FEMA sent me here after the dome came down.<eos> For what?<eos> I'm a trauma specialist.<eos> I help communities recover after, shall we say, stressful events.<eos> I tried to reach out to you after I arrived, but it seemed you'd already moved on.
Was this before or after you engaged in sexual activity?<eos> Before.<eos> Did you have sex more than once?<eos> Is that question really relevant?<eos> I need a detailed timeline of that night as we have no other witnesses to Mr. Lahey's movements.<eos> We had sex one time.<eos> And then you made your way home.<eos> Yes.<eos> That's when I noticed that he was following me.<eos> Mr. Lahey followed you home that night?
My lease is up anyway.<eos> Excellent!<eos> It is true.<eos> Zaman is insane.<eos> He's planning to launch another missile at Israel.<eos> I keep telling him that our goal is not to obliterate Israel.<eos> It's to obliterate India.<eos> Let's discuss that after you take power.<eos> Now, go arrest that son of a bitch.<eos> Talbot will go with you as my eyes and ears.
I want my job back.<eos> I want money.<eos> Baby, I will get you anything you need.<eos> I told you, I'm not good at being taken care of.<eos> Yeah, well, you don't have a choice.<eos> Now go get some rest.<eos> Especially your mouth. You never know when it's gonna be called back into action.<eos> All contracts signed.<eos> Everybody's on board.<eos> Stern will be pleased to hear you got it done. Will he?
Call for a Crusade?<eos> Huh.<eos> My dear boy...<eos> I cannot simply ask my flock to go to war for Rome.<eos> Alliances must be forged.<eos> Bought, if necessary.<eos> And at such a cost that we'd be unable to equip our armies.<eos> I have a confession, Father.<eos> I er...<eos> I have not been entirely honest with you.
Feels good to have the great Harrison Wells behind you, doesn't it?<eos> But one day, this man will turn on you... [laughs] in a flash... and even you won't see it coming.<eos> I only hope that he leaves you in better shape than he left me.<eos> If you're lucky, you'll only be dead.<eos> Because every day I have to live with the agonizing, piercing screaming in my ears.<eos> [laughs] I almost forgot... I told your pet I know your deep, dark secret, Harrison.<eos> Have fun letting him in on that one.<eos> - I assume you were all listening.<eos> Well, Hartley was telling the truth.<eos> I have not been honest with you.
No-one could have done so.<eos> You were not present, my dear Comte, so you cannot know the circumstances.<eos> Rochefort, the King was most anxious that we should present the princess with his marriage gift.<eos> Alas, in the all the turmoil it has not yet been collected.<eos> See to it.<eos> Might I suggest Captain Treville should have the honour?<eos> Despite his unfortunate fall from grace, there is no more reliable man in the King's service.<eos> Have a message sent to him.<eos> This way, madame.<eos> I need to speak with you on an urgent matter.
Milady de Winter!<eos> A moment... ~ HE CLICKS HIS FINGERS ~ Search her bag.<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> THESE were personal gifts from His Majesty.<eos> Keepsakes.<eos> You leave carrying only what you arrived with.<eos> You would be wise NOT to make an enemy of me.<eos> Is that a threat? !<eos> Merely an observation.<eos> If I EVER see you in this palace again... I'll have you executed as a thief.
You lost yours in France, man, at least you got out with your life, unlike most you ordered into the teeth of the enemy.<eos> We were more likely to fall in battle than the ordinary man.<eos> England's finest sons, her future rulers, gone.<eos> And, and who takes their place? Ha, you?<eos> !<eos> Your offspring? !<eos> Me and my sort, aye.<eos> You've not even the guts to remember me.<eos> Remember you?<eos> When you were laying wounded and I stood over you.
Hey!<eos> You brought this on yourself.<eos> You savage!<eos> Porthos, that's enough. Unless you want to kill him.<eos> A champion at last.<eos> A son to defend my honour.<eos> Ah, Milady de Winter.<eos> I owe you an apology.<eos> The last time we saw each other, my behaviour was crude and over hasty.<eos> We can help each other, you and I.
I should have told you before, only...<eos> It's taken me a while to fully understand it myself.<eos> It's funny how many ways we can find to make ourselves unhappy, isn't it?<eos> Well, then, it only remains to wish you good fortune.<eos> I hope you and I can still befriends.<eos> You may depend on that.<eos> You really are a most unconventional woman, Constance.<eos> I've barely even got started yet.<eos> Rochefort, is everything all right?<eos> There is a matter that I must discuss with you in private.
You'll retain your rank, Captain.<eos> But not my uniform.<eos> And at the risk of sounding mercenary, I imagine my pay will be cut as well.<eos> Would you rather go back to the commissary?<eos> I'm offering you one last chance at resurrection.<eos> I suppose that depends on how you look at it.<eos> It seems to me that while murdering savages can be purchased on any corner, those that can command other murdering savages are a rarer commodity.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Whilst we await this special mission, may I base my Rangers wherever I choose?<eos> You'll have a ship at your disposal, so as long as I can reach out to you quickly, that shouldn't be a problem.
The Shippens are the cream of Philadelphia society.<eos> This ball is their way of welcoming us.<eos> So clearly there can be no doubt about their loyalties?<eos> Actually, it is a bit unclear.<eos> Judge Shippen opposed the extension of royal authority, at least where taxation is concerned.<eos> But he also opposed last year's Pennsylvania constitution.<eos> Though perhaps because it threatened his own authority as much as the Crown's.<eos> So is the man for us or against us?<eos> Families such as the Shippens imagine they are above us, sir.<eos> Well, above you, maybe.
Ah, there you are, Mr. Lydon.<eos> See you found the place okay.<eos> It's nice to meet you.<eos> Full disclosure, we're not turnkey yet, and I'm in big trouble if anyone finds out I met you here.
Ah, you can keep walking.<eos> Gotta have an appointment.<eos> Ma!<eos> Ma?<eos> !<eos> The feebs are here.<eos> Oh, Ethan!<eos> Please don't be rude.<eos> How can I help you, agents?<eos> We want to talk to you about four dead men, and the hit you have out on Lily Stoppard.
He's nothing to me.<eos> But he's not, is he?<eos> He's not nothing to you. You're a lawman, a supervising agent, and he is a citizen.<eos> Sure, you may make him unhappy or uncomfortable, but you're not gonna let him die.<eos> You're too damn ethical for that.<eos> They don't know me, do they, Cho?<eos> No.<eos> I think I do.<eos> And I'm gonna bet my son on it.<eos> Nice chatting with you, ma'am.
Excellent.<eos> Hey, Lily.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Fine.<eos> That's good.<eos> Matthew, holding up?<eos> Is it time already?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> Lily's expected to be in the courthouse in a little under two hours, so we'll leave in about an hour.<eos> Matthew, we're gonna need to get you into position ahead of time before Lily leaves the room.
Just try to confirm if it's him.<eos> Jane, I got it. [ Coughs ]<eos> Jane, I'm on the 6th floor now.<eos> Yeah - - Lisbon, it looks like he may be at the other end.<eos> Keep going.<eos> Ma'am, you okay?<eos> Woman: Uh, I hurt my ankle.<eos> Which one is it?<eos> All right, we're gonna need you to reach out here, okay?<eos> You're gonna be okay.
Look at all the stuff you have.<eos> You're a good girl, Liza.<eos> You need to find a young man and get married, have babies.<eos> It's not fair of me, keeping you cooped up here, doing my housework.<eos> You'll never find a good husband here.<eos> Anyhow, if you'd like to get out in the world, I was thinking I could set you up with a bakery or some type of business like that.<eos> So you can be independent.<eos> That's really nice, Mr. F.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But I would rather be here with you.
I got this.<eos> Mr. Falcone, we have your girl, Liza.<eos> Would you like to see her again?<eos> Yes, I would.<eos> She'll be glad to hear that.<eos> For a fit young woman, she has a low pain threshold.<eos> Please!<eos> No!<eos> Stop!<eos> An intermediary will be in contact with you soon.
I am so sorry it took me so long to get here.<eos> Such a day I've had... I won't even tell you.<eos> But I'm here.<eos> You were right about Fish.<eos> It's her that's taken Liza.<eos> Sir, allow me...<eos> I must tell you what I've discovered.<eos> You're not gonna want to hear this.<eos> Speak.<eos> Liza was planted on you by Fish.
To hell with them.<eos> Barbara?<eos> Hi.<eos> Let go of me.<eos> How long you been here?<eos> Just last night.<eos> And a couple times before.<eos> I knew your girlfriend was gone, and I heard you got sent to guard that loony bin, so I figured better here than sleeping on the street.<eos> - Have you seen Barbara?<eos> Oh, so things are over between you two, huh?
Same exact surgical incisions as our last victim.<eos> What are the odds he's got no adrenal glands?<eos> So, what's he doing with them?<eos> Why?<eos> - What's the matter with you? ! - Help me!<eos> Why won't you help me, Gerald?<eos> Help me...<eos> Do you have everything you need, Master Bruce?<eos> Yes.<eos> I can still come with you, if you want me to.
- Exactly. I'm gonna count to three.<eos> You'll disappear... or get a severe beating.<eos> I'm gonna take that as a no.<eos> One..., two...<eos> It's simple economics.<eos> Our lives are worth something.<eos> 60 crates of water, 30 blankets...<eos> You... You're coming with me.<eos> The manager is gonna be very unhappy with you.<eos> I would think this manager wouldn't be too happy with you either.
A pleasure.<eos> I've gone to great lengths to meet you, Doctor.<eos> Indeed you have.<eos> I must say you have a remarkable constitution.<eos> I wish I could say the same of all my patients.<eos> Oh. So I'm a patient now?<eos> No longer a prisoner?<eos> I confess I don't know what you are.<eos> You seize control of the basement, take one of my guards hostage, then scoop out your own eye.<eos> What am I to do with you?
And you'll keep doing it.<eos> You're willing to hold my daughter hostage to achieve your ends?<eos> You're much colder than I thought.<eos> So it seems.<eos> I'll hand in my resignation today.<eos> Just keep Miriam out of it.<eos> No, you're not resigning.<eos> You step down, I'll have someone else to deal with.<eos> And chances are he'll be Falcone's lapdog, same as you.<eos> With you...
Then I'll owe you another.<eos> Cards on the table.<eos> The Foxglove makes a lot of money for some important f...<eos> (gasping)<eos> You think you know who I am.<eos> What I'm capable of.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> Today is an important day for me so I will accommodate your request.<eos> But, Detective, mark my words.<eos> You owe me a big favor.
I've been expecting you.<eos> Ever since your friend borrowed my key,<eos> I've been expecting you.<eos> Even canceled my trip.<eos> Cookie?<eos> When I was a boy, I'd always take a cookie when I had the chance.<eos> You hired a man to kill Alfred.<eos> I hired your guardian's comrade to find out what you knew.<eos> I never intended harm to come to anyone.<eos> I told the board you were a special case, that you need the talk early.
I can't.<eos> Skye.<eos> She harmed herself!<eos> Even though she knew it meant giving up her freedom.<eos> All to save the rest of you.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> She wants to get better.<eos> If you take her away from the people she loves, she'll only get worse.<eos> I know you think I overreacted.<eos> But this decision... leaving Skye with you...
Show her.<eos> Levi ... an old buddy of mine.<eos> Genius.<eos> S.H.I.E.L.D. implanted a chip in his arm.<eos> Couldn't get within 100 feet of any tech.<eos> I found him holed up in an RV in the Mojave.<eos> But now, Sans chip, this guy manages to decrypt the index for me.<eos> Led me to Francis.<eos> Three years, they kept him in a cage ... meds to keep him docile.<eos> I know what S.H.I.E.L.D. did to you.
I went to Puerto Rico to destroy the alien city and stop Dr. Whitehall, and that's what we did.<eos> In part, that's true.<eos> And that's why I want to give you a chance to be the good man I know you once were.<eos> We believe that Fury kept a lot of what he did from the world council, that he had objects and people of terrifying power hidden across the globe.<eos> We want to find them, and we want to make sure that they don't destroy the very world that we fight so hard to keep safe.<eos> Show me how to open it.<eos> Hello?<eos> - Skye.<eos> - May, what's happening?<eos> I couldn't connect to you guys.
Faisal is with Bahrain national security.<eos> Pleasure, sir.<eos> Your people have been tracking her?<eos> Yes, we followed miss Belyakov to a café in this market.<eos> This is a very dangerous area.<eos> Black-market importers, thieves... Not a place for tourists.<eos> So she didn't come for Falafel.<eos> She could be meeting with anyone.<eos> Whatever she wants, it's not good.<eos> Unless she leave with you, our military will take her.
Pain.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Drop your weapons now.<eos> Easy!<eos> Step back! Drop the damn gun.<eos> No!<eos> Easy.<eos> Let her go.<eos> Just put the girl down.<eos> I'll come with you.
No.<eos> I need your pain.<eos> What the hell are you doing, sir?<eos> We have to go.<eos> I need your pain.<eos> I need your pain.<eos> I need your pain.<eos> I need your pain.<eos> Belyakov is controlling you.<eos> Hart, that woman is controlling you.
Then I suppose we should put this matter to a vote.<eos> - Agent Morse.<eos> - I'm in.<eos> Agents Weaver and Oliver.<eos> - No.<eos> Too risky.<eos> - I agree.<eos> Understood.<eos> But I'm voting to go ahead with this.<eos> That leaves you with the deciding vote, Agent May.
Think back to the night of November 21st, 1983.<eos> Coldest night of the year.<eos> Was your boyfriend...husband...workmate acting strangely at the time?<eos> If you have the slightest doubt, or think you saw something at the time, please, call the police.<eos> - That's it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> If I could just get a photo with Mr. and Mrs. Eastwood and the poster? - Do you have the poster? - Yes.<eos> I brought this poster.<eos> Are you all right with...?
Bully for him.<eos> 'Scuse me, I'm looking for Dr. Alec Jeffreys. You know where I can find him?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Just down there.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Dr. Jeffreys?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Detective Chief Superintendent David Baker.<eos> This is not what it looks like.<eos> I wonder if I could have a word with you about a case I'm working on.
I wanted to kill him, too.<eos> Means we're better than him.<eos> I did try to kill him, Fitz, and I'm kicking myself that I failed.<eos> The next terrible thing he does is on me.<eos> Bobbi, Coulson wants us to scout ahead.<eos> - Already locked in the coordinates.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Mack.<eos> Aren't you supposed to be down with Gonzales and Weaver?<eos> I never minced words with you before, sir, and I'm not going to now.
Bobbi, Coulson wants us to scout ahead.<eos> - Already locked in the coordinates.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Mack.<eos> Aren't you supposed to be down with Gonzales and Weaver?<eos> I never minced words with you before, sir, and I'm not going to now.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> The fact that Theta Protocol turned out to be a Helicarrier doesn't change things for me.<eos> Fury brought you back from the dead, and he used alien blood to do it.<eos> And you can't be blamed for what happened to you, but you can't be trusted, either.
- I'm sure mister...?<eos> - Gonzales, Robert.<eos> Robert and I have much to discuss.<eos> You know, I was always excited to meet you.<eos> even when you were a little bit of nothing in your mother's belly.<eos> Oh, I had all these ideas in my head as to what kind of woman you'd turn out to be, and...<eos> You really are magnificent.<eos> I'm very grateful I got a chance to know you.<eos> I'm glad I got to know you, too.<eos> Skye told me what HYDRA did to you.
The Quinjet they stole only fired on the one building.<eos> - Nobody got hurt.<eos> - Except Commander Gonzales.<eos> It either killed him or destroyed any evidence of - foul play against him.<eos> - If it's theater, it worked.<eos> Every Inhuman up there believes that SHIELD attacked their leader and declared war.<eos> - Including Skye.<eos> - Then mark that down as the second time SHIELD got played today.<eos> Figured out what happened to Agent Morse.<eos> She left on a Quinjet with... you.
100...<eos> We'll see you when you wake up.<eos> 99... 98...<eos> Hey, Donny, quit walking, man. Uh...<eos> Mate, it's no wonder you can hardly feel your broken clavicle.<eos> You're in a whole other world of agony here.<eos> It's not a problem.<eos> - I beg to...<eos> - I-I'm fine.<eos> I beg to differ with you.
We're looking for a Matanga Zumbido.<eos> Looks something like this.<eos> Well, let's roll up our sleeves.<eos> Well, you guys know what you're doing.<eos> You don't need me for this.<eos> I don't want to crowd up the place.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hexenbiests.<eos> Makes sense, after everything Adalind's done to the both of you.
I saw it!<eos> You saw it too!<eos> You and Raymond saw it!<eos> I know you did!<eos> You're a...<eos> Why aren't you dead?<eos> Frog paste.<eos> You're under arrest for the murder of...<eos> Come on.<eos> Are you okay?
Bunchy: He's okay.<eos> -Sam:<eos> Who is he? -My bodyguard.<eos> Was he protecting you when...<eos> I wasn't here.<eos> He was alone.<eos> I think.<eos> You want the police investigating this?<eos> I can't stop the police from investigating this.<eos> So I'll settle for you.
Shafe: So, how does this work?<eos> We check the money, they check the product, that kind of thing?<eos> -You've seen too many movies. -(Clanking)<eos> It's already done.<eos> It's like a milkman.<eos> That is smart.<eos> Let's get to work.<eos> -So Arthur worked as your bodyguard, huh?<eos> -Hmm. But you weren't home last night when he was killed.<eos> -Why wasn't he with you?
- Drugs.<eos> - Drugs?<eos> You know, like stimulants, amphetamines.<eos> Yeah, we think he might be dabbling.<eos> Really?<eos> Yep.<eos> Okay, well, no word from Hanna, but Spencer's getting on the highway.<eos> So I'll just text her when we get... uh... get to where we're going.<eos> Thank you so much for the ride.<eos> Should I come in with you?
In Fujiko.<eos> I see.<eos> That's on the way, then.<eos> I can drop you.<eos> But...<eos> No taxis, huh?<eos> No.<eos> Let's walk that way.<eos> Okay.<eos> Are you okay?
Sheldon McFee uses the truck to commute from Cedar Grove, New Jersey.<eos> Shall we leave straightaway?<eos> No.<eos> There's something I need to take care of here first.<eos> You know, we used to be friends, Howard and I.<eos> Lunch at the club,<eos> Christmas parties, charity functions.<eos> To your very good health, gentlemen.<eos> It's 10:45 in the morning.<eos> So, what came between you and Stark?
Mr. Jarvis, go home to your wife.<eos> If you leave now, you may even catch the end of Benny Goodman.<eos> Miss Carter, when you called me, I assumed it was because you needed more than a cab.<eos> I thought I proved rather useful last time.<eos> I agree, but on this occasion... I've got my own ride home.<eos> We now return to "the Captain America Adventure Program," in which our hero's defenseless sweetheart finds herself in the clutches of evil.<eos> American women are so weak!<eos> You are coming with us!<eos> If only Captain America were here to rescue me.<eos> Miss Carver isn't going anywhere with you, Nazi scum.
If you do not pull over this instant, I will have no choice but to shoot you!<eos> For God's sake, will you please stop shooting things?<eos> !<eos> Do I even need to ask?<eos> Ask what?<eos> Yeah, I guess you're right.<eos> I used to strap a chair to my ass and take long walks around the neighborhood, too.<eos> We know who you are, Mr. McFee.<eos> We were on our way to pay you a visit.<eos> So, who did this to you?
We'll keep an open mind.<eos> Miss Carter!<eos> I hear it!<eos> Get Brannis!<eos> Jump clear!<eos> What? !<eos> This is where I get off.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> Thompson, step on it.<eos> Are you all right?
What the hell are you doing?<eos> You're quite good at that.<eos> Yes, Mr. Stark's zippers are under considerable strain.<eos> You're very fortunate, you know.<eos> He missed the bone by 3 inches.<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> Then look me in the eye and say what you meant.<eos> You're very fortunate that I ignored your instructions.<eos> Oh, you're so right.<eos> How I managed to stay alive before I met you, I have no idea.
What can you tell me?<eos> You tell me what happened in the battle of Finow...<eos> I'll help you escape.<eos> Park around the corner.<eos> When I get the real Blitzkrieg Button out,<eos> - drive us back to the Griffith.<eos> - With my heaviest foot.<eos> There's just the single switch on it, right?<eos> Yes, correct.<eos> Are you all right, Mr. Jarvis?
The way I hear you fought, I'm surprised there's any belt left to notch.<eos> Just doing what needed to be done.<eos> Didn't we all?<eos> Hey, Sousa, where did you get that lead?<eos> Russia?<eos> Italy?<eos> My femur, actually.<eos> There's just the single switch on it, right?<eos> Yes, correct.<eos> Are you all right, Mr. Jarvis?
I have a vault.<eos> Somebody cleaned me out.<eos> A couple of weeks later, my inventions...<eos> They start turning up on the black market.<eos> He left me with an ally.<eos> Edwin Jarvis.<eos> He'll help you in any way he can.<eos> As of this moment, Howard Stark is a fugitive from justice.<eos> You're the only one that can clear my name.<eos> Who did this to you?
But I trust Sousa's gut.<eos> Take a couple of men across the street and do a look-see.<eos> What about Ivchenko?<eos> I'll stay here and babysit the doctor.<eos> Do you mind closing that?<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Sure.<eos> Just getting chilly in here.<eos> Of course.<eos> I wanted to have discussion with you.
You're here bright and early. I assume that means you'll be staying with the SSR.<eos> Haven't decided, actually.<eos> I just came to pick up my paycheck.<eos> Well, we'll keep the desk for you, just in case.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - She'll be back.<eos> Which one of you fellas is Jack Thompson?<eos> That's me.<eos> Walt Cooper, United States Senate.<eos> Walt.<eos> I just wanted to come down here and personally commend you for the fine work you and your team did.

They are extremely rare.<eos> Perhaps you should have told me the importance of your cargo before you lost it.<eos> He's asking if you'd like to renegotiate the terms of your relationship.<eos> I'm... sorry if I offended you.<eos> My apologies.<eos> You get that last part?<eos> Yes, threats are clear in any language.<eos> He needs to be taught some manners.<eos> Leave it alone.<eos> If the Russians had spoken to you this way...
He needs to be taught some manners.<eos> Leave it alone.<eos> If the Russians had spoken to you this way...<eos> They aren't the Russians.<eos> No, the Russians actually contributed.<eos> Leland's financials, Gao's product, and Vlad and Anatoly's distribution until we absorbed that facet.<eos> What do Nobu and his men bring to the table?<eos> What... What are they in all this?<eos> A necessary evil.<eos> I just... I don't like the way he speaks to you, that's all.
- Mmm-hmm.<eos> Hoffman was able to spin it.<eos> Told everyone he was assaulted by the man in the mask, then he finished what he started with Blake.<eos> So we're not exposed on that front.<eos> Well, let's have a parade.<eos> This guy, Hoffman, how much does he know?<eos> We're taking care of it, Leland.<eos> Well, that fills me with warm comfort.<eos> Situation's being handled, all right.<eos> Just not by you.
You're betting mine now, too.<eos> Tell me everything you know.<eos> "'You get what you deserve.'<eos> It's an old saying.<eos> One that survived the years, because it's true.<eos> For the most part.<eos> But not for everyone.<eos> Some get more than they deserve.<eos> Because they believe they aren't like everyone else.<eos> That the rules, the ones people like me and you, the people that work and struggle to live our lives, just live, don't apply to them.
Started to wonder if you'd ever turn up again.<eos> Yeah, I've, uh... - been busy. - Hmm.<eos> Well, I'll be inside, you wanna take confession.<eos> Uh, Father?<eos> I was wondering if I could take you up on that latte?
- Sure.<eos> But there's something very intimate in experiencing art through someone else's eyes.<eos> That's a good line, by the way.<eos> You should use it.<eos> I might.<eos> So, give me an idea what you're after.<eos> I am not sure.<eos> Good... art isn't furniture.<eos> If you knew exactly what you were looking for, you'd be just decorating.<eos> Art should speak to you... move you.
I can't do this alone.<eos> I can't...<eos> I can't take another step.<eos> You're not alone, Matt.<eos> You never were.<eos> I've made mistakes... in the years since I was a boy.<eos> I try to learn from them, but it isn't always enough.<eos> Get out of my house.<eos> I'll leave.<eos> But first, I'd... I'd like to have a conversation with you.

I'd like to have a conversation with you.<eos> Off the record, of course.<eos> You think I believe anything you have to say?<eos> Well, I...<eos> I promise that I'll be honest with you, Mr. Urich.
Okay, just... can you do it with your inside voice, without speaking?<eos> That's a very asshole thing to say.<eos> - I'm impressed.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> And now you've ruined it.<eos> You going to work or what?<eos> Not today.<eos> Maybe never, not with Matt.<eos> You two have been friends as long as I've known you.<eos> Whatever's going on between the two of you...
Reach out to Gao.<eos> - Me? - Mmm.<eos> What if she's the one who did all this?<eos> Well, you said you didn't think it was her.<eos> What the hell do I know?<eos> I was almost poisoned.<eos> I'm not thinking straight.<eos> Speak with Gao... if she wasn't involved, we might need her support against further unpleasantries.<eos> And if she was involved?<eos> Then it's been an honor doing business with you.
- He did?<eos> - When I was over at his place.<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> And don't... don't tell me that it was a car accident.<eos> Ask him.<eos> - I did.<eos> - What'd he say?<eos> Just that... it was his fault.<eos> Got that right.<eos> What is going on with you two?
Is that even English?<eos> Ha... simply stated... you're going to convince Mr. Urich... that everything is fine... that you were wrong...<eos> that Wilson Fisk is a good man... a man this city needs.<eos> And then you're going to spread the gospel to everyone you've infected with your negative point of view.<eos> I'd rather die first.<eos> But you won't... be the first to die, Miss Page, no.<eos> No, I think Mr. Urich will have that honor.<eos> Then we'll go to your place of employment, see to Mr. Nelson, Mr. Murdock.<eos> After that, your friends, family, everyone you've ever cared about.<eos> And when you have no tears left to shed, then... then we'll come for you, Miss Page.
We are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system, a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
Guys, where's the coffee?<eos> Communist cake is served.<eos> It's better that we're doing this together.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Just let me do the talking.<eos> Sol, trust me.<eos> The trouble with your socialist dessert is it's very rich.<eos> It's a joke.<eos> It's just good you're trying.<eos> Sol and I want to talk to you about something...
It's about the breakdown in your inspection services.<eos> I need to speak to Martin.<eos> Yeah, I know he's in Singapore, and it's a holiday weekend...<eos> It's not a holiday weekend in Singapore.<eos> Not a holiday weekend in Singapore.<eos> Thank you, Cynthia.<eos> Thank you, Brianna.<eos> She's going to get him, finally.<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry about all this.<eos> I really wanted to be with you this weekend.
- She's in labor?<eos> You've got to get to the hospital!<eos> - Here, you talk to him.<eos> - What am I going to say?<eos> Get me tops that squirt or get me my money back... And be mean!<eos> Ooh, fun!<eos> Listen up, you little piece of shit...<eos> - We're getting her to the hospital.<eos> - Ooh, I guess it wasn't Braxton-Hicks.<eos> Mitch, Robert and I will follow you in our car.
- Hurry up.<eos> - One dollar.<eos> - Two dollars.<eos> - Come on, we have to go...<eos> - Honey, you're on the floor!<eos> - Mom?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> - Don't move.<eos> - We really should call an ambulance.<eos> What's wrong with you people?
Tell them I'm coming to the Jordan Valley myself.<eos> Sir, I--<eos> I'm gonna meet with Petrov face to face, on the ground.<eos> - Mr. President, the risk factors of--<eos> - I'm well aware.<eos> I want to be notified the moment that Petrov is on his way.<eos> You work with the CIA and DOD to figure out any logistics and security you have to.<eos> Talk to Seth.<eos> Let's start drafting our message.<eos> Cathy, I want to sit down with you and Defense, and work out bargaining chips.
You're good at this.<eos> They loved you.<eos> Three decades of campaigns, you learn how to read an audience.<eos> Self-promotion gives me hives.<eos> Honestly, I don't know how you do it.<eos> I'm promoting my husband, not myself.<eos> That's a convenient way to spin it, don't you think?<eos> Are you always this blunt?<eos> I only have two days to tag along.<eos> Mind if I ride with you, since we have so little time?
Everybody, Mrs. Underwood needs to leave us now.<eos> I really wish I could stay, but I have a very full day tomorrow.<eos> I should rest up. But again, I want to thank you all for your hospitality and all of your hard work.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Good night, everyone.<eos> His trickle-down diplomacy is another example of delusion.<eos> Mrs. Underwood.<eos> Oh, you should go back inside with the volunteers and have the full campaign experience.<eos> I didn't come to New Hampshire for that.<eos> I came to speak with you.
I did the math.<eos> You and Francis, you've....<eos> We've what?<eos> He's shared a lot.<eos> Does that bother you?<eos> Why would it?<eos> Another betrayal?<eos> No.<eos> You're...<eos> Are you okay?
Should I leave Tina in the shoebox or set Tina free?"<eos> - Leave her in the box!<eos> - Set her free!<eos> - Set her free!<eos> - Leave her in the box!<eos> Oh, my goodness!<eos> I don't know what to do!<eos> Nothing!<eos> Do nothing!<eos> Sir, Mr. Grayson needs to speak with you.
Why?<eos> I didn't want to e-mail it to you.<eos> - This is it?<eos> - The first chapter.<eos> Justice Jacobs served our nation with duty and distinction.<eos> And when the Court was strongly divided, as it was many times during his 23 years on the bench, it was his swing vote that created legal precedents that will last for centuries.<eos> Now, it will not be an easy seat to fill, but fill it I must.<eos> Sir.<eos> Dunbar's people just reached out to me.<eos> She's back in Washington and she wants to meet with you.
Deadline was 24 hours ago.<eos> Why am I still picking Ethernet cables out of my ass?<eos> We're working fast as we can on a Saturday, Mr. Blanchard.<eos> But we gotta work safe, too.<eos> It's...<eos> Making money has never been safe.<eos> Remember that, and someday you'll be the one giving orders to peons.<eos> Right behind you, sir.
Let me look at you.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Don's not gonna be fine.<eos> I can't do anything about his internal bleeding.<eos> I thought I'd keep his spirits up.<eos> Got anything to keep my spirits up?<eos> This isn't as bad as it looks.<eos> Being taken hostage by Islamic radicals is my definition of bad.<eos> Yeah, well, real radicals don't hang half their propaganda posters upside down.<eos> Nice meeting you, Dr. Ward.
- I had the flu.<eos> - Oh. You know, you didn't have to do this little makeup seminar just for me.<eos> I've been to many of these over the years, and I think I know right from wrong by now.<eos> Oh, but the rules are always changing.<eos> For example, do you know about the Jenkins vs. Hershfeld case?<eos> I was the presiding judge in the case, so yes.<eos> Why don't you just sign that little piece of paper that says I completed the seminar, and I'll be on my way?<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Four hours of discussing inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace with you...
These things really work.<eos> Look... really?<eos> I can... I can see him too.<eos> You can?<eos> All right, what do we do?<eos> We go get our guy.<eos> By any means necessary.<eos> Ow! Okay, that's bright.<eos> Yep.<eos> Uh, Mr. Panz, we'd like to talk to you for a minute.
Moe Lester?<eos> ~ How did she not see..?<eos> Aloud.<eos> "Jen.<eos> My name is Moe Lester.<eos> "I am CEO of Columbia Records.<eos> "Would you be interested in signing with us?<eos> "Columbia!"<eos> Yes, thanks for your message.<eos> "I would be super stoked to sing along with you guys,
"Jen.<eos> My name is Moe Lester.<eos> "I am CEO of Columbia Records.<eos> "Would you be interested in signing with us?<eos> "Columbia!"<eos> Yes, thanks for your message.<eos> "I would be super stoked to sing along with you guys,<eos> "it would be awesome."<eos> Hi Moe.<eos> Yes, I would be super stoked to sing with you guys.
And then, in the morning...<eos> Dear mom, as usual I'm too proud to apologize face-to-face.<eos> But I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I was totally disrespectful, and I love you, and I really appreciate everything you do for me and Jane.<eos> So can we just put it behind us and never talk about it again?<eos> You know me; I get embarrassed.<eos> Love, Xo.<eos> _<eos> Unfortunately, a letter wouldn't solve Jane's current problem.<eos> - I just really want you and Rafael to bond, and I think dinner together will help.
I have time to sort it out, so...<eos> Your mom is right.<eos> Life is short.<eos> We spend all our time working.<eos> It should be spent doing something that you love.<eos> Besides, all the other stuff...<eos> the baby and the bills... you know I'll take care of that.<eos> What do you mean, you'll take care of it?<eos> Oh, I was...<eos> I was just agreeing with you, that she should take the internship, and she shouldn't make a decision about money.
_<eos> (sighs) And he wants to talk.<eos> Again.<eos> We're talking with you here again because it looks like your dad is Sin Rostro and has been running a plastic surgery ring for criminals inside your hotel.<eos> And it's really hard for me to believe that you knew nothing about it.<eos> You know, I liked it better when you were suspended.<eos> Look, if your father needs money or a place to hide, he might contact you.<eos> And if that happens, we need to know.<eos> And you will.<eos> Because I was the one who contacted you when he met with the shady subcontractor.
Sorry.<eos> I think I'm just a little bit in shock.<eos> I know it's a lot of information.<eos> You guys should take some time, discuss it, and let me know what you want to do, okay?<eos> (Quietly): Mm-hmm. Okay.<eos> Uh, thank you, doctor.<eos> Of course.<eos> Now, I do get booked though, so if you're leaning toward having the procedure, call right away.<eos> Latin lover narrator: Jane kept waiting for the doctor to turn around and say everything was going to be all right.<eos> I'll talk to you soon.
- Okay? - Mm.<eos> Okay, guys, new session starts next week, so don't forget to tell your parents how much you love Miss Xo.<eos> Oh!<eos> Are these your students, the future entertainers?<eos> Yes.<eos> If you don't mind.<eos> Of course I will speak to them.<eos> Hello, children.<eos> For those of you with parents who don't own a television, my name is<eos> Rogelio DE La Vega, and I would like to talk to you about show business.
- Exactly.<eos> And he will persevere.<eos> And it was 34 years ago.<eos> Hmm?<eos> 35.<eos> That's as high as I'm going.<eos> Good.<eos> So call your agent, tell her to keep looking.<eos> Open up the search.<eos> Oh, good, I need to talk to you guys.
Not you... you were just a child.<eos> All you remember is what you did out there.<eos> And that's the soul that you want to save... just that one soul.<eos> We had a one-shot deal.<eos> I go back in time.<eos> I kill a man for you, and it's all over for me.<eos> I get erased.<eos> I'm not supposed to be here anymore.<eos> None of us are.<eos> Oh, Mr. Cole, you and I... we want the same thing... to change this reality.
Are you listening?<eos> Mr. Cole, you are welcome to spend the rest of your life right here on the floor of this cell.<eos> That's one option.<eos> What's the other one?<eos> Depends.<eos> Do you believe in fate?<eos> Sure... fate, karma, Santa Claus.<eos> I'm very spiritual.<eos> Spirituality is just science we don't understand... yet.<eos> Call it what you will, but something led you and me to this moment.
I need a doctor over here now!<eos> Mr. Cole!<eos> Mr. Cole!<eos> Temporal interference.<eos> Okay, so what's the count now?<eos> Is that guy coughing up blood?<eos> Nurse, I want that man inside now.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Doctor.<eos> Doctor, I need to speak to you.
You're walking through a red forest, and the grass is tall.<eos> You're walking through a red forest, and the grass is tall.<eos> The grass is tall.<eos> You're walking through a red forest.<eos> The grass is tall.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Because you're important.<eos> He was plans for you.<eos> The Witness.<eos> He wants to meet you.
You smell like tandoori skewers.<eos> I had a bunch of 'em.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> That's him.<eos> I'm gonna go talk to him.<eos> - Excuse me, Dr. Garret?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> May I speak with you privately for a minute?
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime and find others like me.<eos> And one day, I'll find who killed my mother...<eos> Mom!<eos> And get justice for my father.<eos> I am The Flash.<eos> Previously on The Flash... (Cisco) Ronnie was vaporized in the accelerator when it went critical.<eos> Ronnie's alive.<eos> I saw him, Cisco.<eos> Firestorm.<eos> I wanted to talk to you about Firestorm.
What do you mean?<eos> You know, I mean, he was into someone, an unrequited love thing.<eos> You know, he had feelings for someone, and they weren't really reciprocated, so...<eos> Yeah, maybe just give him time.<eos> Sure.<eos> (Caitlin) There he is.<eos> Looks like the tracker Barry placed on him worked.<eos> Professor Stein?<eos> Ugh, I told you to stay away from me.<eos> And I will, but there's someone else who wants to talk to you.
This body's taste buds would obviously be different from my own.<eos> Perhaps I'm now a light beer man.<eos> There are worse things to be.<eos> You mean like a living nuclear bomb?<eos> You know.<eos> Unstable nuclear fission was always a danger in the transmutation process.<eos> Plus, you all argue very loudly.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But my friends are gonna figure out how to fix this, I promise.<eos> I remember meeting you, Mr. Allen, on the train.
We can separate you!<eos> We can stop the explosion.<eos> How?<eos> A Quantum Splicer.<eos> It's a fission device designed to bombard your atoms with as much energy as they experienced in the particle accelerator explosion.<eos> It should be enough to separate you.<eos> Please, Professor, you have nothing left to lose.<eos> Ronnie, if you're in there, I love you.<eos> That was from him.<eos> I look forward to meeting you in person, Professor.
We're coming home.<eos> All of us.<eos> - Ronnie Raymond.<eos> - Cisco. Man. Ohh.<eos> I missed you so much, man.<eos> I shouldn't have locked you in there.<eos> Hey...don't.<eos> Welcome back, Mr. Raymond.<eos> Dr. Wells.<eos> Caitlin told me what happened to you.
Martin despises pizza.<eos> Is that the delivery man?<eos> Oh, Mr. Allen. I suppose it's too much to hope you moonlight as a pizza boy.<eos> I am famished.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, bravo!<eos> Please, come in.<eos> Mr. Allen.<eos> Oh, mmm. What can I do for you?<eos> I--I needed to talk to you about a paper that you wrote 25 years ago for the Oxford University Press.
Singh's checking in.<eos> I gotta go. Yeah, I'll meet you at the station.<eos> Joe, We'll find Mardon.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm not worried at all.<eos> Well, he's taking being targeted by a revenge-seeking meta-human rather well, I must say.<eos> Don't worry, Barry.<eos> Joe will be fine, I promise.<eos> Yeah, no, I know.<eos> I actually wanted to talk to you about something else.
Oh. I'm Mason Bridge.<eos> Oh, you're the guy who thinks Harrison Wells is some mad genius?<eos> Oh, no, no, no, I never said he was crazy.<eos> He's a sociopath and a liar, for sure.<eos> Really?<eos> You don't see it?<eos> All the time you two spend together.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Sometimes when I'm bored, I follow him around.<eos> And for the most part, he keeps to himself, except when he's meeting up with you, which he seems to do quite a bit.
That's the first time I ever heard anyone use the word "great" to describe a break-up.<eos> I have a feeling that I'm about to move forward with someone really special.<eos> Okay. Go ahead, Barry.<eos> Hi.<eos> I don't normally do this, but I was watching you, and... can I buy you a drink?<eos> Uh...wow. I mean, I'm really flattered, but I...<eos> Actually, I was talking to him.<eos> Um... I'm... I'm sorry, you said... you said you were talking to me?<eos> Yeah, I just told my friends over there that I thought you were cute and they dared me to come over here and talk to you, so... please talk to me.<eos> Yeah, I suppose I can talk to you for a little bit.
Well, your son is an extraordinary man, Dr. Allen, And I will do everything in my power To ensure barry's future.<eos> It's time, Joe.<eos> - No.<eos> - No?<eos> - No.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You seem like you could use a hug too.<eos> Your father is an extraordinary man.<eos> You're lucky to have him.<eos> I'm lucky to have you too.
What's up?<eos> Look, whoever is framing Eddie, I got to thinking.<eos> What if they've done something like this before?<eos> I went through CCPN's crime archives, and in the last 11 months, there have been six crimes committed by people who later swore that they were innocent.<eos> None of them had priors, all of them had rock-solid alibis.<eos> - All right.<eos> - So... I hacked into my dad's CCPD account, and went through the footage of Eddie shooting those cops. Look.<eos> What do you want us to do, Thawne?<eos> Die<eos> What's wrong with you? Huh?
You ever go back?<eos> No.<eos> Too many memories of Tess.<eos> That's right. Sorry.<eos> You, Detective, are one of the few people I know that truly understands that kind of loss.<eos> Iris's mother, you never talk about her, do you?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.<eos> No?<eos> You and I, Detective, are members of a rather exclusive club, I suppose.
- May I come in?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> I wanted to apologize.<eos> I should have listened to you when you warned me about Brie.<eos> Perhaps next time I will take the CCPD's offer of protection.<eos> After we lost your tachyon prototype, I can understand why you were hesitant to trust us.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> I couldn't help but notice some tension between you and Dr. Wells.

We stood by you after everything that happened.<eos> I can see how this must be difficult for you to understand, but trust me, your lives now are so much better because of what I have done for you.<eos> You don't have to hide anymore.<eos> We know you're not Harrison Wells.<eos> Just tell us who you are.<eos> A confession will get you nowhere.<eos> You've seen who I am.<eos> You know what I can do.<eos> You want to kill me, go ahead.<eos> I'm not gonna fight you.
You've seen who I am.<eos> You know what I can do.<eos> You want to kill me, go ahead.<eos> I'm not gonna fight you.<eos> But just tell the police what you did.<eos> Get my dad out of prison.<eos> I don't want to kill you, Barry.<eos> I need you.<eos> And...<eos> I also did not anticipate, as difficult as the past 15 years have been for me, how much I would come to love working with you.

Doors create boundaries.<eos> Boundaries are a bummer.<eos> You know what else is a bummer?<eos> Tall guys with small penises?<eos> That you just missed the gelato and designer coffee cart.<eos> Espresso hazelnut praline?<eos> We're not here for gelato.<eos> We're not not here for gelato.<eos> Awesome.<eos> It's awesome to meet you.
What, are you kidding?<eos> What are you doing with this?<eos> What are you really up to?<eos> It's a present for you.<eos> It was supposed to be a surprise.<eos> We knew you were upset about the press conference.<eos> We wanted to do something nice, so we got you Max Hardy's address, the code to her alarm system so you can kill her.<eos> When the time is right.<eos> I'm sorry I doubted you.<eos> And I-I shouldn't have acted out like I did without talking to you first.
Do I know her?<eos> Well, you might.<eos> She's local too.<eos> Chelsea O'Bannon?<eos> Sure.<eos> Pretty girl, as I remember.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Nice girl.<eos> Yes, she is.<eos> Well, it was nice seeing you, Mrs. Rayburn.
- There are no grounds.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because I can't.<eos> You didn't do this.<eos> You didn't protect him for Sally.<eos> You did it for you.<eos> Because, for some reason, you feel this guilt.<eos> - So you always let him back in.<eos> - Please take the kids and go.<eos> This drama between you?
What have you done?<eos> What have you done?<eos> I have told you everything.<eos> Get out.<eos> Argh!<eos> Argh!<eos> WOMAN: Just try slowly breathing down a bit, Beth.<eos> ~ You can go.<eos> ~ It's all right.<eos> I'll wait with you.
We're gonna take such good care of you, you know.<eos> Such good care.<eos> That you are gonna be so loved.<eos> So, so loved.<eos> You are.<eos> You are.<eos> We'll get it right this time.<eos> (PHONE RINGS)<eos> Hello.<eos> 'I won't follow you.
When you took possession of Mr Miller's computer, did you find further evidence of communication between the defendant<eos> ~ and Danny Latimer?<eos> ~ We found an email account under a false name.<eos> Only used to send emails to Danny.<eos> You're being handed an exhibit.<eos> Exhibit MJC735 from your jury bundles.<eos> Could you confirm that these are printouts of the emails sent from this account?<eos> ~ I can.<eos> ~ And would you read the email sent to Danny Latimer on the 29th of May.<eos> "Great seeing you last night.
The world is screwing you over right now.<eos> You owe yourself something.<eos> When was the last time you had sex?<eos> We've got nothing more to say.<eos> I've got plenty to tell you.<eos> Notes, interviews, people's movements on that night.<eos> I knew you'd never want to clear my name so I started working on it myself.<eos> Talking to people.<eos> And they spoke to you?<eos> Well, I told 'em I was you.
~ Are you medically qualified?<eos> ~ It was obvious what had happened.<eos> Why didn't you call the police?<eos> I didn't want to dump Nigel in it.<eos> How do you explain police forensics finding four cigarette butts with your DNA on them next to Danny's body?<eos> I've smoked a lot of cigarettes on that beach.<eos> ~ Why did you take the skateboard?<eos> ~ I thought it might get nicked.<eos> It did get nicked, didn't it?<eos> By you!
Not true.<eos> What's not true?<eos> You don't know men like that or you do?<eos> I never said it!<eos> Why would she lie?<eos> ~ She's a journalist.<eos> ~ Right!<eos> Journalists and police lie and you're the only honest woman here.<eos> If you like.<eos> Isn't it true that every word you have told this court since you stood up in the witness box is a lie?
Lisa killed Pippa by accident.<eos> Got rid of the body and went on the run.<eos> She did that and she's still alive.<eos> You've got to admit, it's a possibility.<eos> You ready?<eos> Come on.<eos> You're a prosecution rebuttal witness.<eos> You are there specifically to rebut part of the defence case.<eos> Hello, Mr Carter.<eos> Was anyone with you that night?
~ Mm-hm.<eos> Just... got into a bit of a scrap.<eos> You should see the other girl.<eos> Have you reported this to the police?<eos> What's so funny about that?<eos> I think I need a bit of sanctuary.<eos> I've got some antiseptic wipes - I can have a look at the eye for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It was my husband - he found out I'd had an abortion.<eos> ~ Has he been violent with you before?
~ Thought you'd come round.<eos> ~ Spoken to Claire yet?<eos> ~ What do you want?<eos> ~ Did you ever sleep with Lisa Newbury?<eos> ~ No.<eos> ~ Did you want to?<eos> ~ No.<eos> ~ She turn you down?<eos> ~ No.<eos> What did Claire make of you and Lisa?
Thank you, My Lady.<eos> Members of the jury, thank you for your careful attention to the facts and for delivering your verdict.<eos> You have discharged your duties honourably.<eos> This has been an...<eos> This has been an extremely difficult and distressing case, and, as such, this court excuses you all from any future jury duty.<eos> Thank you.<eos> ~ You OK?<eos> ~ Claire Ripley, I'm arresting you on suspicion of the murder of Pippa Gillespie and Lisa Newbery.<eos> You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something you later rely on in court.<eos> Anything you do say may be given in evidence.
I did something.<eos> Something that in a million years<eos> I never thought I could do. I keep telling myself it was to protect my daughter, but I... I did it.<eos> I crossed that line, and...<eos> And now I don't know... you don't know how you'll go back.<eos> I'm sorry to tell you that you can't.<eos> So what do I do?<eos> You must find a way to make amends, to take responsibility.<eos> How?<eos> That is between you and your God.
He's the one who took the photo.<eos> Rabbi, what... what is this dybbuk?<eos> It's the evil spirit that cleaves unto the soul, and on it does, it never lets go.<eos> Michael.<eos> Drill says you can wake up now.<eos> Hi.<eos> Now it's your turn.<eos> The doctors here, they couldn't get through to Thomas.<eos> He refused to talk about what happened that night, said they would never believe him.<eos> But he talked to you?
I'll be at Carson's tonight for Holly's memorial.<eos> Whoever killed her will probably be there, too, eating deli meat off a toothpick and talking about the good times.<eos> That's perfect.<eos> You can take a look around.<eos> During my friend's memorial?<eos> We'll never have another invitation to Carson's house without a warrant.<eos> Just keep that third eye open<eos> Oh, there's Major.<eos> Can we go over?<eos> How are you two?
Clothes gone, no IDs, no computer.<eos> I'll put out an APB on her.<eos> She's on the run.<eos> We'll get her.<eos> I'm not so sure we will.<eos> Sir?<eos> Congrats, Babineaux.<eos> Job well done.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Uh... There's something else I'd like to talk to you about.
I have several recommendations for you.<eos> Really, Doc, I am fine.<eos> You're not fine.<eos> After what you've been through, nobody would be fine.<eos> Fine.<eos> If you will be my counselor.<eos> And we do it at my place.<eos> No. I have some trauma training, but it's not my area of focus.<eos> I like you.<eos> Hey, I can talk to you.
Hello!<eos> Good morning, good morning.<eos> Oh, Penguin, thank God.<eos> Get me out of here.<eos> Maroni's men will be here any minute.<eos> Yes, I imagine so.<eos> Mustn't stay long.<eos> But... I knew I'd regret it if I didn't say good-bye to you in person.<eos> It was me, old friend.<eos> I did this to you.
And he'll get it back.<eos> Listen. You're all twisted over what happened to Barbara.<eos> You're not thinking straight.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe. But I'm done in this town anyhow.<eos> - What do I have to lose?<eos> - Your life.<eos> Huh? How 'bout your life?<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> I thought the fix was in with you guys.
Nobody. Anybody who did is dead.<eos> We'll be safe here.<eos> Hello.<eos> What's up?<eos> I know, I know.<eos> It's astonishing.<eos> Sometimes I astonish myself.<eos> I feel like, uh..., this is all a dream..., and I'm gonna wake up soon.<eos> Barbara..., you were abducted.<eos> Your parents were killed in front of you. Yeah.
Right, babes?<eos> Oh, ho, just... All right, relax.<eos> I'm kidding you!<eos> Guys, no, seriously.<eos> Don't call her "babes".<eos> Or "toots" or what have you.<eos> It's a woman's lib thing.<eos> I am relaxed.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Barbara, we've been circling around the subject, but haven't talked about what actually happened to you;

I'm gonna miss this town.<eos> You won't change your mind?<eos> - The town needs you.<eos> - No. Gotham needs a lawman now, not a criminal like me.<eos> A strong lawman.<eos> You looking at me?<eos> Someone needs to grab this city by the neck and shake it hard.<eos> That's you, Jim.<eos> I know it in my bones.<eos> There's a lot of powerful men who would disagree with you on that.
Back in the '80s, being a man's man was simple.<eos> All you needed was muscles or a mustache.<eos> Unfortunately, I was miles from Dolph Lundgren and no Chuck Norris...<eos> Get scared, boys.<eos> Goldberg's coming for you.
Just give me...<eos> give me one second.<eos> Now... why would you do that?<eos> It's just not the right time.<eos> Not right now, not with what's going on with Julie.<eos> Whatever happens with Jules-- there's nothing you and I can do about that.<eos> But if she was sitting in that chair right now, she would tell you to get your ass on that plane to San Diego, and you know it.<eos> You need to do this, bud.<eos> You're not trying to sneak out of here, are you?<eos> No, I wouldn't do something like that to you.
Is this what it's like when we come in?<eos> God, I like it much better being on the other side. MARTY:<eos> Hey, kiddies.<eos> Get your trunks.<eos> It's time to deliver these deliverables to SkyEast. Yep.<eos> Hey, Martin. Yeah. Martin?<eos> So we got a few initial findings, okay?<eos> So let's talk through them.<eos> Yeah, now's not a great time, Ron. We've got this local engagement we've got to go to.<eos> Oh, great. I'd love to join you.
The shame. Flipping burgers. (laughs) So depressing.<eos> May-Maybe it was pride.<eos> Let me see it again.<eos> Oh, yes, that's what it is-- it's probably pride.<eos> This is really good, sir. Hey.<eos> Okay, Charles, can we...<eos> Serious as ever.<eos> Okay, inside intel. You know Luke Sullivan is looking to maintain the same level of product quality and customer service Shags is known for?<eos> Yeah, but franchising at the level that he's suggesting makes that impossible.<eos> I know that's true, you know that's true.
You don't have room for anyone else.<eos> I'll never forget the first time Sarah brought you for Thanksgiving.<eos> I was so nervous I couldn't even eat.<eos> I mean, your home is so beautiful. Hold on, Dad.<eos> Hold on one second while I fill him in, okay?<eos> Mr. Schiller, I'm afraid I have some bad news.<eos> My father's jet had to make an emergency landing in Baltimore.<eos> One of the engines caught fire.<eos> Now, he's okay, but he just, he feels terrible.<eos> He'd like to speak with you.
I mean, we keep it on the DL this time.<eos> Next time, it's me and you.<eos> Arm in arm, promise.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hi, Doctor.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> What the hell is she doing here? Where's Dr. Mason?<eos> I called Dr. Shahani.<eos> I want Dr. Mason here!<eos> Luther Mason... (scoffs) I can't even call him "Doctor"-- had his license revoked two years ago for doing to another patient what he's now doing to you.
♪ The star of the show tonight. ♪<eos> (chuckles) How you doing?<eos> Fine, thanks.<eos> I-I know we haven't had a chance to talk much, but I just wanted to take some time to tell you how happy I am that you're here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's a big night for you.<eos> Yeah, if you'd have told me a month ago I was gonna be performing again, I wouldn't have believed you.<eos> But Cookie pulled this all together.<eos> She did.<eos> Ooh, Elle, can I get a selfie with you?
Mom, here. Oh. Okay.<eos> I don't know how to do all this.<eos> Don't worry, sweetie, he'll get the hang of it. MALCOLM:<eos> I'll get back to you with a proposal. In the meantime, I'll be standing by.<eos> What are you two scheming up?<eos> Oh, we're talking about the new security system we're having installed.<eos> Kevlar-lined walls, infrared cameras, a bunker...<eos> Place is gonna be an impenetrable fortress.<eos> You know, Mr. DeVeaux, I was thinking maybe I need to... beef up the security at my place, because, you know, I live alone.<eos> Sir, I'll get those numbers and get back to you.
Let her go.<eos> Why should I?<eos> I...<eos> What?<eos> It was wrong of me to let you move home again.<eos> It was a mistake. MY fault.<eos> So, where's he supposed to go?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But you're his dad...<eos> Of course he wants to be with you.
Congratulations, Detective.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Our final promotion goes to Sergeant Sidney Gormley.<eos> He is promoted to the rank of Lieutenant.<eos> Congratulations, Lieutenant.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> And again, congratulations to all of you and, just as importantly, to your families.<eos> A lot to be proud of here today.<eos> Commissioner Reagan, my wife Sheila.<eos> Nice to finally meet you.

I didn't say I changed my mind.<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> Seeing if you're right.<eos> I'm not following.<eos> I called the lady who thought there was another person in the car.<eos> You did not.<eos> Yeah, then I did some poking around Ted's life.<eos> Saw what he might have been up to the day that Mia was hit and who he might have been with.<eos> Well, who was it?<eos> I'll talk to you guys later.
-You know when you last saw her right?<eos> -I don't have the time.<eos> -You must answer these questions.<eos> -I don't have anything to do with this.<eos> -You can leave soon.<eos> -When did you last see Minna?<eos> -I don't know anything about Minna.<eos> Wait!<eos> Hey, wait up!<eos> We must talk to you before you leave!
Ah, well, so much for Southern hospitality.<eos> This ledger might be something.<eos> Offshore bank accounts, transaction amounts, dates.<eos> This might be his life raft.<eos> You better hope it's worth my cut of $3 million.<eos> I think it's worth a shot.<eos> I'll be in touch.<eos> How's Ava doing, Boyd?<eos> It must have been quite a shock, her getting out of prison the way she did.<eos> You want to chat about movies or politics or how I take my coffee, I'm happy to oblige, but ain't no way in hell I'm gonna talk to you about my fiancee.
You're in the middle of the road.<eos> I'm driving.<eos> I can see that.<eos> Where to?<eos> I'll call you back.<eos> It's none of your business, Officer.<eos> Still none of your business.<eos> Let me get this straight, son. Where you're following me to is none of my business?<eos> That's how you see it?<eos> I'm not following you.
Let me get this straight, son. Where you're following me to is none of my business?<eos> That's how you see it?<eos> I'm not following you.<eos> Step out of the car. Stretch your legs a bit.<eos> God damn.<eos> You comfortable in this car, a man your size?<eos> It's a little tight.<eos> Yeah. So, where's your buddy?<eos> Who's that?<eos> You know, the guy you were with.
I'm not following you.<eos> Step out of the car. Stretch your legs a bit.<eos> God damn.<eos> You comfortable in this car, a man your size?<eos> It's a little tight.<eos> Yeah. So, where's your buddy?<eos> Who's that?<eos> You know, the guy you were with.<eos> How do you know I was with a guy if you ain't been following me?<eos> I'm not following you.
God damn.<eos> You comfortable in this car, a man your size?<eos> It's a little tight.<eos> Yeah. So, where's your buddy?<eos> Who's that?<eos> You know, the guy you were with.<eos> How do you know I was with a guy if you ain't been following me?<eos> I'm not following you.<eos> Are you saying you ain't following me like you don't know what I'm saying, or are you just repeating this bullshit about, you ain't been following me?<eos> I'm not following you.
See, the deal with Choo-Choo here is, he got, uh, some shrapnel in his head...<eos> Yeah. And now I spend most of my time trying to keep him from doing something stupid.<eos> Better watch what you say in front of other people.<eos> Watch what I say in f...<eos> You just told him you were gonna kill a Marshal!<eos> Keep disrespecting me, you're gonna ride the train.<eos> I'm all aboard, Choo-Choo.<eos> - Come on!<eos> - All right.<eos> As much as I'd love to sit and hang with you guys,
Why would you say shit like that?<eos> You got me drooling all over myself.<eos> All I can say is if I have another slice of pizza, I'm gonna lose my shit.<eos> You see what happens if you call me a peacock?<eos> Ah, Choo-Choo. Here you go.<eos> We just can't stop running into each other, can we?<eos> We ain't running into each other.<eos> I'm the cowboy from earlier.<eos> Yeah, Choo-Choo was saying.<eos> You were under the impression he was following you.
I was on my way to the ladies' room and got lost.<eos> I, uh, found myself down here.<eos> I just can't belive you have this whole big thing and you don't have, like, tours or something.<eos> Ladies' is upstairs.<eos> Mundo, will you show our guest the way?<eos> Let's get you up where you were going.<eos> All right, then.<eos> - It was nice meeting you, I guess.<eos> - Likewise.<eos> Hey, y-you got a number or something that I can reach you by {*} in case you want to come take, like, a real actual tour or something?
- Far as he knows, two guys in masks busted in, touched him up, grabbed the keys to the Emulex shed.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - The cops see bruises on him, goes a long way convincing them he wasn't in on it.<eos> - Yeah. - Again, it's for his protection.<eos> Ban. You know what I wouldn't give to pull a mask on, take a few free pokes at my daddy?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Well, I guess we know why they stopped at a five-and-dime.<eos> Halloween come Early.<eos> You think they think if we don't hear their voices, we won't know who's under those masks?<eos> Were you boys not listening when I said we followed you here?
- We've met.<eos> - Well, in that case, I'm afraid you have me at a disadvantage.<eos> My name's Avery Markham.<eos> Guess I can't blame you for not remembering.<eos> Last time I saw you, you were no bigger than minute.<eos> 9, 10 years old.<eos> Peacocking around your daddy like you thought you was already a full-grown bad man.<eos> I recognize you now, Mr. Markham.<eos> That being said, I still don't recall being bounced on your knee.<eos> Nevertheless, it, uh, seems that I owe you an apology.
I talked to Rachel's parents, and they said that Audrey really intimidated Rachel.<eos> And that she could get her to do things that she wouldn't normally do.<eos> Maybe that's the only way her parents could justify their daughter liking a girl.<eos> Maybe. Sure.<eos> It's just...<eos> It's hard to know the truth unless you have the whole story.<eos> - Are you ready? - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Miss Duval?<eos> Detective Lorraine Brock.<eos> I was hoping I could speak with you?
Evidence was missed.<eos> - Someone has to be held accountable.<eos> - What evidence?<eos> We found hair fibers and skin cells at the hospital.<eos> DNA test came in.<eos> Can you confirm the results?<eos> The markers look good for a match.<eos> Who is it?<eos> Someone with clear motive and opportunity.<eos> And unfortunately, it's a suspect that was right in front of you both this entire time.
- Raine!<eos> That's enough.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> You can go now, Sheriff.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We're not answering any more questions without an attorney.<eos> That's fine.<eos> But I would like to see the footage from Audrey's camera on the night of Nina's murder.<eos> I don't have it.<eos> Can I talk to you outside?
Thank you.<eos> We're not answering any more questions without an attorney.<eos> That's fine.<eos> But I would like to see the footage from Audrey's camera on the night of Nina's murder.<eos> I don't have it.<eos> Can I talk to you outside?<eos> Of course.<eos> Greetings, programs!<eos> I'm on the Game Grid.<eos> Leave a device ID and I'll get back with you...
That's quite a crib you've got down there.<eos> Talk about craftsmanship.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> My lieutenant asked me to investigate property records Within 10 miles of where emily was discovered.<eos> I came across this cabin owned by sparrow song, inc.<eos> I wouldn't be doing my job if i didn't come down here.<eos> You can look around all you want.<eos> Go ahead, we got nothing to hide. Clive:<eos> About the crib...<eos> You were handcarving it Like you knew there would be a baby here at some point.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system-- a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
Dude, I get through time locks, magnetic seals, shit you wouldn't understand even if I drew you a diagram.<eos> This old pile of tungsten, this is just pure brute force.<eos> Drill and kill.<eos> You want to see what I can do?<eos> Next time, make it tough.<eos> - One job at a time, Wiz.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Give me your cellphones.<eos> Ava, come over here and meet the classiest jeweler this side of the Mississippi.<eos> Oh, so nice to meet you, Winston.
They wanted to help out the enemy why<eos> Because I found<eos> Jews like me<eos> Can not return to their home back anywhere<eos> They are helping me to help myself<eos> After all, this is just a piece of paper<eos> Take care of your granddaughter<eos> Of course I will.<eos> This is my only family<eos> Gano why they did not go with you
Okay.<eos> Dr. David Kurata.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> The average score of the multiple choice section was a staggering... 62%.<eos> So, if you don't know the difference between an allele and a chromosome by now... there's nothing I can do for you.<eos> The, uh...<eos> The short essay questions were worth five points each, um... but because there are six questions that account for 25...<eos> Hey!<eos> Dr. Kurata?<eos> Look, you obviously think I'm going to do something to you.
Get out.<eos> I know what's going on.<eos> One of New York's sharkiest lawyers is divorcing you.<eos> Do you think you're gonna get a penny out of Hogarth?<eos> You could use someone in your corner.<eos> You're making a lot of assumptions.<eos> What assumptions?<eos> That she's a lawyer?<eos> A shark?<eos> That she's divorcing you.
It's you.<eos> Um, Sarge, that's not Trish Walker.<eos> No, no, this is the one who...<eos> Sorry, we had our headphones in.<eos> I'm helping Trish make a party mix.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> You're with Ms. Walker?<eos> Yes, she's with me.<eos> This is my apartment.<eos> Are you all right, ma'am?
I'm gonna hit the switch.<eos> She is going to kill him.<eos> No, she won't.<eos> She's holding back.<eos> Come on, you cowardly piece of shit!<eos> You don't have the balls to fight me?<eos> This isn't you, Jess.<eos> We were happy.<eos> Whatever you think I did to hurt you, I'm sorry.<eos> What's the matter with you people?
No, I'm okay. Kozlov's a great doctor.<eos> Your pupils are dilated.<eos> Yeah, that's because I'm on meds.<eos> Well, I did almost die, after all.<eos> - What kind of meds?<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> And, you know, I feel much better than I look.<eos> Trish, if you're making a vaccine, then I wanna help.<eos> Detective Clemons told me.<eos> What happened to you?
Maybe Kilgrave thinks Albert can improve upon his original work.<eos> You can't improve on an asshole by making it bigger.<eos> - Hey, where you going?<eos> - Away from you.<eos> Hey, man, take it easy.<eos> I'm speaking truth, man.<eos> - It's okay, he's been through a lot.<eos> - Yeah, we all have.<eos> Don't talk about me in the third person.<eos> I'm standing right in front of you.
- Luke Cage.<eos> - Jess didn't, uh, mention you to me...<eos> - He's a friend.<eos> Who knows about Kilgrave.<eos> I found out the hard way.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Can you give us a sec?<eos> My wife was a big fan of your show.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's lovely to meet you.
Boom.<eos> - Who pays for that? - Oh.<eos> Production.<eos> Comes right out of the budget, which, for a film like this, is about $6 million, and I've got four of it lined up already.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. It's my editor.<eos> I told her I was meeting with you, and I just want to tell her that she might be talking to a new screenwriter.<eos> Let her know you got a hit here!<eos> And I do believe that.<eos> I would not have flown all the way out here from L.A.<eos> to meet with the two of you if I didn't.
I'm screwed here, too.<eos> My boyfriend's in California, and he's probably calling me right now, and I can't answer<eos> - because my phone's...<eos> - You can't talk to your boyfriend?<eos> I am this close to losing my kid to foster care...<eos> - I know you have it way worse.<eos> - Hey!<eos> ... and you can't talk to your boyfriend?<eos> Hey, hey, hey!<eos> What is it with you two?
Sorry. He hates it when I talk about death.<eos> Mrs. Pratt...<eos> Please, call me Iris.<eos> Iris. Uh...<eos> I'm gonna get an X-ray to confirm this but, um, my guess is that three time's a charm and you're gonna need a shoulder replacement.<eos> You see, gran?<eos> I warned her.<eos> Doctor, if I have this surgery, who's gonna look after Cameron?<eos> Well, that's not really my department, but um...<eos> Once you're admitted here he could stay with you.
No, no, no, she can't be in labour, the baby's lungs aren't ready... the balloon, it's still in her trachea.<eos> So we're going to unplug, we're going to go in, pop the balloon, deliver, and ventilate baby.<eos> Breathe, Ruthie, breathe.<eos> Try to stay calm, alright?<eos> We're just going to check the incision.<eos> Pauline, I need nifedipine for Neshema.<eos> I need to delay these contractions until we've deflated the balloon.<eos> - Get Doctor Katz.<eos> - No!<eos> - Incision's fine. - Can I speak to you, privately?
The clinical trial in Mexico.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No one should have to go through that.<eos> You're not the real bad guy here.<eos> Whoever hired you took advantage of you.<eos> You were out of your mind with grief.<eos> But the man who paid you?<eos> He wasn't.<eos> He was cold and calculating.<eos> He should pay for what he did to Derek... and to you.
We're getting back together.<eos> As soon as Derek comes out of this,<eos> - he'll tell you.<eos> - If he comes out of this.<eos> Okay.<eos> Until then... is there anyone that can back this up?<eos> A family member you might've told?<eos> An e-mail you might've sent?<eos> I can probably find e-mails that I sent my sister in Oregon.<eos> Something you didn't draft personally might be a little bit more convincing.
Would you two mind?<eos> (clicking)<eos> Hello?<eos> Louis Carlisle?<eos> Mr. Carlisle, we're here to help you!<eos> Stay away from me!<eos> (panicked muttering)<eos> We're from the NYPD, we're not gonna hurt you.<eos> Mr. Carlisle, we know about E-Zed-M.<eos> We know that there are people after you.
It's odd, the other people who took this drug could barely talk.<eos> One of them we know went insane.<eos> But he seems... not fine, exactly, but he's functioning.<eos> The experimenters gave different amounts of the drug to everyone who participated in the experiment.<eos> Clearly got some sort of brain damage.<eos> Look at his hand.<eos> Must have gotten the smallest dosage.<eos> Just so we're clear, Mr. Carlisle, you're not under arrest.<eos> We just want to ask you some questions, all right?<eos> Who did this to you?
They gave me the drugs, and I spent the night there.<eos> They said, um, I might feel like a lot of time is passing, and it definitely felt weird, but I was okay.<eos> Till a couple days later when this started.<eos> I sent them an e-mail.<eos> Thought they'd help.<eos> Instead, people start following me.<eos> People, who?<eos> What did they look like?<eos> I don't know, I never got a great look at anybody.<eos> How about the people who came to you to conduct the study?
Are you serious?<eos> He proposed last night over dinner.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> When can I meet him?<eos> Well, he's really busy right now.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> Are you doing your breathing?<eos> This cannot happen here.<eos> Not in Houston.<eos> Well, it was a real pleasure praying with you, Mr. Franklin.

Are you doing your breathing?<eos> This cannot happen here.<eos> Not in Houston.<eos> Well, it was a real pleasure praying with you, Mr. Franklin.<eos> Now you get some rest, no wild parties, and we'll see you back at the church real soon.<eos> You know, the good news is is the doctor said you're doing great.<eos> So, you know, you'll be back to your 20-year-old self in no time.<eos> I know these group homes can be a little rough, Peter, but we found some nice foster parents in Arkansas who would love to take you in.<eos> Ma'am?<eos> Ma'am, can you tell me what's bothering you?
Famine... and Death.<eos> I love them all.<eos> But there is a big difference between us.<eos> They want to break all the seals and bring about the Rapture and the end of humanity.<eos> I don't.<eos> After all, what fun could I possibly have without all of you to screw with?<eos> I'd be bored to death.<eos> So you see, I don't want the Apocalypse.<eos> I just want the status quo.<eos> The Apocalypse is good for the Horsemen but very bad for you and me.
I-I just need to work on my blindside block.<eos> Yeah, well, journalism can be kind of rough.<eos> - I can handle it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Kendell Dossing.<eos> Nice to meet you, Kendell.<eos> What publication are you with?<eos> It's just a little blog.<eos> We write about new agriculture.<eos> You know, it's not Time or Newsweek, but, um... an interview with you could put me on the map.
Let me guess.<eos> Vincent loves a quick score.<eos> Exactly.<eos> So... it made things difficult.<eos> Now, we don't often see eye to eye on certain projects.<eos> Like Smart Rain?<eos> Yeah, exactly like Smart Rain.<eos> And when it destroys farms after Vincent launches it, he'll make sure I get all the blame.<eos> I get it. Really, I do.<eos> I think that you and I are a lot alike.
Defense Secretary Richards has to be the one who's behind this.<eos> You believe I'm innocent?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> I'm an outspoken journalist, and a Muslim at that.<eos> Most people find it easy to conclude that I'm a terrorist.<eos> I'm not most people.<eos> Look, I have to, have to go.<eos> I have to get back to my body, okay?<eos> Y-You're just going to leave me?<eos> No, we're gonna come back for you... I promise.
In the beginning, a star fell from heaven and changed us.<eos> Made us angels and gave us a new destiny:<eos> to stop the Apocalypse and the Devil himself.<eos> We must pass God's test and prove humanity is still worth saving.<eos> For we are the Messengers.<eos> Previously on The Messengers...<eos> I've collaborated with the Horsemen in the past.<eos> War, Pestilence, Famine, and Rose is the Horseman of Death.<eos> - So, why are you telling us this just now?<eos> - The Apocalypse is good for the Horsemen, but very bad for you and me.
Someone I can watch over.<eos> Just like God watches over you.<eos> What is that?<eos> The GPS coordinates for the Horsemen's launch site.<eos> I strongly suggest you get the hell out of here and stop those drones, Vera, because if you don't... you're gonna have a whole lot of blood on your hands.<eos> Okay, Professor.<eos> You want the good news or the bad news?<eos> Uh, wow, let's get the bad out of the way.<eos> You're not going home.<eos> Vera asked me to come get you, so you're gonna have to leave your car here; I'm driving.
I should very much relish the chance to see the lights myself.<eos> The Sunday school children would love that.<eos> And there'll be plenty of room on the bus.<eos> I'm sorry, I'm going to exercise my power of veto.<eos> You know my views on dicky chests and cold winds.<eos> And we need you at compline, Sister.<eos> Sister Mary Cynthia is at the twin birth.<eos> She won't be back tonight.<eos> You speak to me and of me as though I am a child.<eos> No, we speak to you and of you as though you have been ill.
All right, all right, your enthusiasm is duly noted.<eos> Now let's turn our minds back from our performance to our patients.<eos> Nurse Mount.<eos> SHE GARGLES<eos> You've made me swallow it.<eos> It's meant to be a gargle to lubricate my tubes.<eos> Mrs Turner recommended it after rehearsal.<eos> My singing is rather rusty.<eos> I'd have recommended engine oil.<eos> I'm not going to quarrel with you.
Ted, Sr: Daniel assaulted Teddy.<eos> What?<eos> When I had my miscarriage, part of me was relieved.<eos> Do you want to save your marriage?<eos> Amantha and I are taking a step back.<eos> Have you thought any more about our conversation?<eos> You just waited for us to leave. And then you killed her.<eos> We're a long way from saying this happened to George by another's hand.<eos> Where's the gun then?<eos> I'd check in on Trey Willis, if I was you.
I've... I've never met anyone with your life, ever.<eos> It's... it's amazing.<eos> And... and you are amazing for having dealt with it the way you have.<eos> I mean, I can't even begin to imagine how hard it's been for you, but you...<eos> By God, you've pulled it off.<eos> You are impressive, Amantha Holden.<eos> And you're one hell of a trainee.<eos> - And you're going places, kid.<eos> I can tell.<eos> Well, Mr. Forrest, uh It has been lovely drinking free booze with you.
Wants to humiliate me.<eos> Thinks it sends a sharp message to the Pope.<eos> I feel like Katherine. Cast off.<eos> But still, I love him.<eos> What will we do?<eos> Bribe people.<eos> You still have land.<eos> Even if the king takes everything you have, people will ask themselves,<eos> "Can you truly give what belongs to the church?"<eos> No one will be sure of their title unless you confirm it.
I need a husband to stop them calling me names.<eos> Well...<eos> You should ask for someone young and handsome.<eos> Don't ask, don't get.<eos> No, what I want is a husband who upsets them.<eos> And who won't die.<eos> Don't ask, don't get.<eos> They'd kill you.<eos> You're right, they would.<eos> If she sent for you, she means to flatter you.
Cromwell, what are you doing, listening to the conversations of gentlemen?<eos> The servant who dragged the King out of the ditch what was his name?<eos> Oh, Master Cromwell likes to hear of the deeds of those of low birth.<eos> His name was Edmund Mody.<eos> Muddy, more like.<eos> You've a good eye. A good arm.<eos> Well, at this distance...<eos> We have a match every Sunday, my household.<eos> We meet up with our fellow guildsmen, and we destroy the butchers and the grocers.<eos> What if I came down with you, one week?
He was so sad.<eos> He's come back to make me ashamed. For taking his kingdom. Using his wife.<eos> If Your Majesty's brother died before he could reign then that was God's will.<eos> And as for your supposed marriage, well, we all know that that was clean contrary to the scriptures but...<eos> With God, there's mercy enough... Not for me!<eos> When I come to my judgement he will plead against me.<eos> He has come to make me ashamed. And I alone must bear it.<eos> I...<eos> I alone.<eos> Did your brother speak to you?
And then I thought, Lady Anne, you remember? She was just a girl. She wanted to marry him.<eos> Revenge...<eos> She waited her time.<eos> Harry. If I had known I would have waited dinner for you.<eos> I fear we've almost finished the fish.<eos> Shall I pray for a miracle?<eos> My lord, I arrest you for high treason.<eos> Your warrant?<eos> There are items in my instructions you may not see.<eos> Well... If you won't show it, I won't surrender to you.
Even from Whitehall.<eos> The world is run from Antwerp, from Florence, from Lisbon.<eos> From wherever the merchant ships set sail off into the west.<eos> Not from castle walls, from counting houses.<eos> From the pens that scrape out your promissory notes.<eos> So believe me when I say that my banker friends and I will rip your life apart.<eos> And then, when you are without money and title, yes, I can picture you living in a hovel, wearing homespun, bringing home a rabbit for the pot.<eos> Your lawful wife, Anne Boleyn, skinning and jointing that rabbit.<eos> Yes, I wish you all happiness.<eos> You were never pre-contracted.
Your lawful wife, Anne Boleyn, skinning and jointing that rabbit.<eos> Yes, I wish you all happiness.<eos> You were never pre-contracted.<eos> Any understanding you think you have, you didn't have it.<eos> And if you think Lady Anne loves you - well, you couldn't be more mistaken.<eos> I've just come from her.<eos> She hates you.<eos> She despises you.<eos> She wants you gone.<eos> So if you say one more word about Lady Anne's "freedom" with you, I will come and drag you out of whatever hole you are cowering in and the Duke of Norfolk will bite your bollocks off.
Valerie Cullen had something that you needed.<eos> Now, I think that she believed that Silvexpo and Dennigs knew a lot more about the deadly effects of asbestos.<eos> She called a meeting, you were expected to attend, Dr Cullen.<eos> She told people that you had more to say about that - what was it?<eos> My wife's state of mind was confused.<eos> I had nothing new to say.<eos> I know nothing about any meeting.<eos> Then why did she kill herself the following night?<eos> Why?<eos> What passed between you when you went to her house?
May they rest in peace.<eos> Amen.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Does the truth get buried down there with her?<eos> We've missed something here, John.<eos> I'm going to start again.<eos> Let's start with Valerie's office.<eos> Love, love, love!<eos> Don't you think this is a bit pointless?<eos> I agree with you but nobody's told me to stop cleaning her room.
Were you angry with him about that?<eos> Nah.<eos> It was Scottie.<eos> That's what he was like.<eos> No point being angry with him.<eos> Thanks.<eos> He spent a fortune on these unnecessary drawings and models made by these fancy architects from Sweden.<eos> He was even talking about chucking another bridge over the Tyne, as if there aren't enough of those already!<eos> This all had to be paid for and I got sick of forking out, so he borrowed on the property.<eos> He used property that was partly owned by you as collateral for his own debts?
Nowt.<eos> He just stared into the parapet.<eos> He had blood on his head, but he was standing up straight.<eos> And you would both be prepared to repeat this story in court, where to tell a lie is called perjury and carries a prison sentence?<eos> Write it down.<eos> Done us up like a pair of kippers.<eos> So, what do we do now - just let them all go home again?<eos> If you'd like to take a seat.<eos> A man is dead.<eos> Between you, you four people - supposedly his nearest and dearest - are responsible for that death, however it came about.

Follow them, every step of the way.<eos> Guv, no, no.<eos> We haven't got the manpower.<eos> It's in Newcastle.<eos> It's not our patch.<eos> Well. We'll get Raven Street CID on it, every available man.<eos> That bastard's going to slip up sooner or later. All right.<eos> What?<eos> McDonald lad's here.<eos> He wants to talk to you.
It does not care for religion, even if we do.<eos> Brother, he cannot be trusted.<eos> He is a savage, they all are. I am not the one who murders with no remorse!<eos> Compose yourself, Templar.<eos> Sied has experienced this evil before.<eos> I neither need nor want his help.<eos> Enough, Thomas.<eos> I will hear no more.<eos> You may not want his help, but I say it is God's will.<eos> Sied rides with you.
Not anymore.<eos> Trail splits here.<eos> There are two sets of the same tracks<eos> West... and north.<eos> Alright.<eos> We spread out.<eos> Freya, Godfrey. Hit the trail toward the west.<eos> Twenty leagues.<eos> We meet back here by nightfall.<eos> He goes with you.
What--what did he say?<eos> What--what did he look like?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I didn't--<eos> I didn't see him face-to-face.<eos> He gave me this.<eos> What is it?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Mr. Stormgren.<eos> Can I see you for a minute?
I didn't know what you might like.<eos> Some men want a younger version of what they've got at home.<eos> Some like to try a different flavor.<eos> For my part, if I never fuck another blonde again, it'll be too soon.<eos> Cheers.<eos> I'm good, Simon.<eos> But thanks for the offer.<eos> I don't know what to think, James.<eos> You spurn my hospitality, you want all the credit in the papers.<eos> What am I going to do with you?
You need to help yourself.<eos> And the best way for you to do that right now is to help me implicate him as Ghost.<eos> Tommy's not Ghost.<eos> I saw your face, Holly, so I know you already know this.<eos> Your boyfriend Tommy Egan is a major drug trafficker with the street name Ghost.<eos> I remember you.<eos> You fucked James at Truth.<eos> What?<eos> Up against the wall in his office.<eos> He's cheating on Tasha with you.
Have you thought about that?<eos> I've thought about everything.<eos> bullshit.<eos> I got to figure out my next move.<eos> Keep fucking her.<eos> What?<eos> Tasha, i don't even know if that's an option.<eos> Oh, i saw the bitch. Trust me.<eos> It's an option.<eos> Whatever this thing between you two is, It's gonna work in our favor.
When you signed this, you were 20 years old, in love.<eos> You had no idea what you were doing.<eos> But I have to admit this kind of agreement can be hard to break.<eos> You said your husband was living outside the home?<eos> Yeah, I kicked him out.<eos> There are some women in your situation who choose to work within the marriage.<eos> That might be the better option for you.<eos> You mean stay married to him?<eos> You live completely separate lives, but you keep the joint bank account and the status.<eos> As long as he lets you keep the family residence, it can work out.
Workers discovered these bodies while building a roadway in Gliwice, Poland.<eos> They were buried almost a thousand years ago.<eos> Notice how their heads have been severed and placed beside their feet.<eos> Thus we can see the pagan myth of vampires persists well into the Christian era.<eos> Isn't it possible that these myths persist because vampires are real?<eos> Some still believe that.<eos> Here is your homework assignment for Monday.<eos> Remember, all quotes must be footnoted.<eos> Professor Setrakian?<eos> Eldritch Palmer would like to speak with you.
If we can get this to happen in the wild, then this bug can obliterate the vampires' central nervous system.<eos> Let's grow up a batch and give it a try.<eos> Showtime.<eos> May I have the speech?<eos> You should read it first.<eos> We should go over<eos> - a few things in it before...<eos> - I'm sure I'll love it.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Mayor, esteemed council members.<eos> It's... a pleasure to be here with you today for the opening of our first Freedom Center
I dropped it.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> The Jew was right behind me.<eos> He knew my real name.<eos> He knew everything about the cane too.<eos> A230385.<eos> Please, Herr Standartenflihrer, I need the money to get out of Europe.<eos> The Mossad are here in Vienna looking for me.<eos> If that Jew goes to them...<eos> What's happened to you, Doctor Dreverhaven?
I told him that I had to be out of the system.<eos> And he's been in the system, so he understands.<eos> - I should have never called you that night.<eos> - Yeah, but you did.<eos> Is Robert here?<eos> So, uh, how'd you get all the way over here?<eos> I took the bus.<eos> A couple, actually.<eos> Wow.<eos> Callie told me she's coming to live with you.
The presumption is that the, um... Cult would have owned the boat.<eos> So I'm just gonna look at it from that angle.<eos> Is there something I should know?<eos> No.<eos> About--no.<eos> I'll let you know if I find anything.<eos> Yes?<eos> Mrs. Fallon, we're with the FBI.<eos> We'd like to ask you a few questions about your son.<eos> The lawyer said I can't talk to you.
- Will do.<eos> - Uh, Detective Bosch?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'll be right out.<eos> - I think I fucked up on the Waits' case.<eos> - How so?<eos> I got a call here in the lab right after Waits was arrested.<eos> Guy said he was from the D.A.'s office, sounded totally legit.<eos> He said you guys hadn't turned in an evidence report yet and he needed to know what was found at the grave site.<eos> He couldn't get a hold of you, and...
What...<eos> What was I supposed to do, drive up there and knock on their door?<eos> Tonopah is a six-hour drive.<eos> I'll call you back, Jerry.<eos> - Mr. Blaylock?<eos> - That's me.<eos> I, uh, saw you waiting out there.<eos> My name's Harry Bosch.<eos> I'm a detective... LAPD.<eos> I was wondering if I could speak to you and your wife about a case I'm working.
- Mom, stop.<eos> - No, lookit.<eos> I know I've been spoiled having you here as long as I have.<eos> You know, when we packed you up for college, I never thought you'd be living here again.<eos> And I never could have guessed that when you did move out, it was because you were gonna get married.<eos> I never could've guessed a lot of things about my life right now, but there are so many things happening that I am excited about.<eos> I am getting married.<eos> I've got an amazing honeymoon planned in Italy, I might write a book.<eos> And don't ever call me again!<eos> It's been a pleasure... getting to know you ladies.
Did we miss anything big?<eos> Actually, there's something I need to tell you.<eos> - Can we talk?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Well, well.<eos> Strippers, jail, mystery talks.<eos> Sounds like you missed out, Bren.<eos> Sounds like we both did.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - It's a summary page for the book I wanna work on with you.
The pews don't got cushions.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Nice.<eos> Hey.<eos> Come on.<eos> I know you can use more tongue than that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Why is it you only get extra handsy when death cab over there shows up?<eos> I mean, clearly, something happened between you two.
Come on.<eos> I know you can use more tongue than that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Why is it you only get extra handsy when death cab over there shows up?<eos> I mean, clearly, something happened between you two.<eos> Well, yeah, we used to date, but it's been over for months.<eos> And yet you're more concerned about making him jealous than being real with me.<eos> Th's... not true.<eos> I don't know what happened between you two or how you ended it, but I'm not interested in being used.
I was thinking about milestones and... had a last minute change of heart.<eos> I was hoping I wouldn't be too late, but...<eos> I guess I was.<eos> Get some rest.<eos> I'm taking you off the clinical trial.<eos> So, it... wasn't working?<eos> I don't know if it was the cause of your rash or your respiratory issues, but we really can't risk it right now.<eos> So, what's the next step?<eos> Well, you'll have to stay here a few days under observation, and take it very, very easy.<eos> Doctor, could I speak to you privately for a second?
I'm April's mom Sara.<eos> - Oh, hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> She promises to stay quiet.<eos> Thank you so much for all your help, Josh.<eos> Oh, well, this trial is just branching outside of pancreatic cancer and is particularly sensitive right now.<eos> And this principal investigator isn't known for her sensitivity.<eos> Hi.<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> It's a pleasure meeting you.
Did you see any physical changes?<eos> Oh, yes, yes.<eos> Laszlo channeled this spirit called Fadó.<eos> I know how it sounds, but I swear it was real.<eos> I saw him change, his whole face.<eos> He was something completely different.<eos> It's... it's kind of hard to describe.<eos> He had fur, and he was sort of animallike.<eos> You must think I'm crazy.<eos> Who was in the room with you when it happened?
Hey?<eos> Simon?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> I think it's him.<eos> I think he's messing with us.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Hey.<eos> Dear Robyn and Simon, I guess I owe you both an apology.
Too large for London.<eos> Dear John.<eos> We're so sorry.<eos> At least I hope it's what you want.<eos> But it isn't. Not at all.<eos> You're having quite a clean sweep.<eos> We've kept a few portraits to make a decent show in the London house, but what's the point of storing the rest?<eos> This life is over for us.<eos> It won't come back.<eos> I admire you.
Her confession is real.<eos> This time, it IS over.<eos> - Oh, I can't believe it!<eos> - I shouldn't have come until now.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I should have waited.<eos> - Never mind that.<eos> - I'll go and tell His Lordship.<eos> You both helped us when all hope was gone, and I'll not forget it.<eos> I find it hard to acknowledge a debt but we owe a debt to you.
Ruiz wants to be more big time than he is.<eos> A few months ago, he actually reached out to Lobos and tried to make a play behind our backs.<eos> And the motherfucker is still alive?<eos> I mean, I didn't trust him, but he's actually a valuable part of our whole operation.<eos> Thanks, Tiny.<eos> She ain't been Tiny in a minute.<eos> Speaking of moving weight, I ain't never dropped this much money off on a connect.<eos> Where y'all supposed to meet him at?<eos> I don't know. He's supposed to text Ghost with a spot.<eos> Well, why don't I come with you?
I swear to God, doc, you better be right.<eos> - Jo!<eos> - I'm right with you, Jo!<eos> Trust me!<eos> Stop!<eos> You're gonna kill us!<eos> Jo.<eos> Jo?<eos> Jo!<eos> Detective Martinez, looks like you're gonna be okay.
And what can I say?<eos> I believe in spoiling my kids.<eos> [Camera shutter clicking] [Police radio chatter] The victim shows signs of alcohol intoxication.<eos> So, likely drunk, he climbed onto the barrier and fell.<eos> Well, why aren't his hands wrinkled?<eos> Who's that?<eos> Me?<eos> Hi.<eos> Lucas Wahl, Assistant M.E.<eos> Yeah, I sat right next to you on the way up, so...
Welcome back, Henry.<eos> Yes!<eos> I hear Henry's back.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He turned up this morning.<eos> He's gonna work the Fox case with me.<eos> How does he seem to you?<eos> Seems okay.<eos> Same old Henry.<eos> Well, you and I both know that examining dead bodies is a hell of a lot different than being responsible for one.
I'm something of an expert.<eos> Have your friend call me with an estimate.<eos> Will do.<eos> I look forward to hearing from him.<eos> All right.<eos> Terrible...<eos> Terrible news about Karl.<eos> I admired the work that he was doing with his father's art.<eos> His murder seems particularly unjust in light of that.<eos> Well, according to phone records, he was on the phone with you the night he was murdered.
Don't be a bore, Henry.<eos> No.<eos> No. Mm.<eos> Don't answer it.<eos> Is there something the matter with our young patient?<eos> The young prince is recovering quite comfortably.<eos> My apologies.<eos> Um... Your Highness.<eos> You saved my son's life.<eos> I bow to you.
Dates back to the reign of Nicholas I, am I right?<eos> It is a... reproduction.<eos> The original would be extremely valuable.<eos> If you don't mind...<eos> Henry, why don't you give him his vase?<eos> Of course.<eos> If you'll excuse me, I must be getting back to work.<eos> Some cultural attaché you are.<eos> Look who's hungry.<eos> I will talk to you, but only if you promise to leave the FBI out of it.
Let me summarize your list of woes...<eos> We got motive, opportunity, and now we got a murder weapon.<eos> A bowl with trace amounts of polonium-210...<eos> That's the poison we found in the victim's body.<eos> You wanted the king dead, so just tell us how you did it.<eos> If I knew he was heir to the throne of Urkesh, you think I would have poisoned him, like a woman?<eos> No need to get sexist, pal.<eos> I would have stabbed him in the heart with a knife and told him to rot in hell for what he did.<eos> What exactly did he do?<eos> Guy was just a kid, same age as you, when the revolution went down.
If you don't mind, I'll be with you in a moment.<eos> Wait, we're investigating Rick Rasmussen's murder.<eos> We believe his death is connected to something he salvaged from the sea on your behalf.<eos> I hate this, I really do.<eos> W-- sir, we need to talk.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, Isaac Monroe.<eos> I hate public speaking.<eos> Wish me luck.<eos> Why, he's a little full of himself, huh?<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, to be honest with you, I'm not much of an adventurer.
He handed the gold over to you?<eos> That's correct, per my contract with Captain Rasmussen.<eos> Dr. Morgan?<eos> Dr. Henry Morgan?<eos> That's me.<eos> If this is about my suit, I would have dressed properly, but -- There's a call for you, sir.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You still want to take me in?<eos> No, that won't be necessary.<eos> A few hours alone with you under the lights -- that's more interesting than this party.
Nora.<eos> Nora!<eos> Nora-a-a-a-a-a!<eos> Nora.<eos> Ah. What do you have there?<eos> You know, that faceless stuff Got me thinking about my old activist days -- You know, students against the war.<eos> Hey, there's eggs, if you're hungry.<eos> Yes, i wanted to ask you about that.<eos> In an activist group, you've got devoted individuals With strong-held, high ideals.<eos> Did things ever get tense between you?
I don't mean to brag here, but I do draw a pretty exceptional bath... with a little lavender, a little essential oils.<eos> Spark one up and get weird with my damn self.<eos> So, she is going in there?<eos> Yes.<eos> We're going to hydrate the body with Ruffer's solution, invented by sir Marc Armand Ruffer in Egypt turn of the last century.<eos> So, Trash Bar, huh?<eos> That's cool.<eos> That's cool.<eos> Wouldn't have been my choice, you know?<eos> I would have gone a little classier with you, right?
Well, why don't you ask Henry?<eos> I mean, missing-persons case, hidden files...<eos> Sounds like a rocking Saturday night for him.<eos> Oh, I forgot to mention...<eos> Henry must not know about this, because, um, when my mother went missing, things got kind of dark, uh, for me, that is.<eos> I just don't want to worry him.<eos> Right. Uh...<eos> It's just...<eos> I want to help you, but I have a lot of trouble keeping secrets with Henry, because he sort of plays those jedi mind tricks.<eos> I'm sure you've felt them.
That seems odd.<eos> Javier obviously cared very much about you, he even gave you injections of azathioprine to treat your bone condition.<eos> When exactly were you diagnosed?<eos> About a year ago.<eos> How terrible to learn you'd have less than a year to inhabit a role that you'd spent a lifetime working for.<eos> Still, the question remains, why would Javier bother cutting off your foot if he knew your career would soon end?<eos> I said I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> He would have done anything for you.<eos> Or I should say to you.
When I discovered the bloody uniform he was wearing the night he killed Belinda Smoot 30 years ago.<eos> And you brought him here?<eos> Well, what else was I supposed to do...<eos> Take him to the sheriff's department?<eos> I'll call Internal Affairs to come pick him up.<eos> But in the meantime, no one with a badge goes near that man.<eos> Have I made myself clear?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Loud and clear.<eos> I wasn't talking to you.
The Hope Diamond, the Kusanagi Sword.<eos> Caesar's dagger is equally cursed.<eos> Some say that where the pugio goes, death follows.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you, but I-I don't think an ancient curse followed Blair into Central Park and killed her.<eos> I should never have let her go alone so late.<eos> Late?<eos> What time?<eos> 10:00 P. M.<eos> So Blair left work at 5:00, only to meet you five hours later?
Now have a seat.<eos> Can you tell me exactly what happened?<eos> We went to go see the fireworks.<eos> Ben drove me home.<eos> He was lonely.<eos> And he invited himself into my house.<eos> And then what happened?<eos> And then he raped me.<eos> He ran away in the morning, but he broke into my house and accused me of killing my own son.<eos> So, he raped you, and then he spent the entire night sleeping next to you?
She can't face anything.<eos> I can't believe you're both considering this.<eos> Every day for 16 years, I got a lecture about consequences.<eos> - Natalie, stop.<eos> - What happened...<eos> Jess is in jail!<eos> I'll take care of it. I'll get her out.<eos> Tom's dead, Dad.<eos> How are you gonna take care of that?<eos> I'm not going anywhere with you.
She didn't just attack Tom out of an impulse because she overheard you and your wife argue.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> It was premeditated murder.<eos> She lured him.<eos> She took him down to the river, and when he panicked, she hit him on the head repeatedly.<eos> That was rage, and it was a rage I witnessed at the fireworks.<eos> You were there.<eos> I chase killers.<eos> She didn't accidentally drop her phone.<eos> She saw the affection between you and Jess, and then she smashed her phone - to the ground. - Aah!
I shut my program down.<eos> You shut it down?<eos> That's right.<eos> You know what I'm focusing on now?<eos> Solutions.<eos> What exactly are those solutions, Ritchie?<eos> Oh, would you like to hear some...? Here's the first one.<eos> Solutions.<eos> Yes, Adam.<eos> Professor Simpson, I need to talk to you about my office hours today.
So, this, uh, chap Carter... he a mate of yours as well?<eos> Uh, it's okay, Lily.<eos> This is my, uh... colleague, of sorts, John Constantine.<eos> I'm just trying to piece together what happened to your mate last night.<eos> It's all right.<eos> You can answer his questions.<eos> I'm confident my associate is not gonna get you in trouble.<eos> We were at the cemetery.<eos> Look, we were just trying to have some fun.<eos> Any others with you?
-Yeah.<eos> -I guess it was a good funeral.<eos> A lot of people came.<eos> 'Cause your dad was a good man.<eos> You hold on to that.<eos> Jose, your mother wants you to come back to the apartment.<eos> Carlos, may I speak with you?<eos> -Yeah, I should really just...<eos> -It'll only take a moment.<eos> Oscar told me about the rift between you two.
Might I speak them?<eos> You would not mind?<eos> - If it pleases you, then...<eos> - Oh, my dear, it would please me greatly.<eos> My mother did not tell me that playing rantum-scantum would be thus.<eos> It did not please you?<eos> It was strange, but not unpleasant.<eos> Seymour, I'm sure before long, they will call me to serve His Majesty as Privy Counsellor.<eos> Perhaps it is my destiny that I might one day be Prime Minister.<eos> Well, if one day you are, I shall be very proud of you.

No.<eos> You see, my lord, what hurts me greatly is that she will not even try.<eos> To think, I married a sour-faced prig!<eos> I will be tender, madam.<eos> You are the purest pure.<eos> You are beautiful, madam.<eos> And you are fair handsome, sir... and that I am grateful.<eos> Your husband is a damned fool.<eos> But, fool such as he is... .. this is his dearest wish.<eos> Was Deerhurst not kind to you?
Sir... are you truthfully giving evidence to this court that you had no indication at all that Lady Worsley and Captain Bisset were, shall we say, intimate friends?<eos> No, sir.<eos> And if I may say, my lord, I was and remain deeply shocked and alarmed by this whole affair and if I may also say, my lord,<eos> Sir Richard and Lady Worsley were very happily married and until she made the acquaintance of Captain Bisset, she always did her husband's bidding.<eos> Thank you, Captain Leversuch, that will be all.<eos> How is it just that Richard can paint such a false picture of our marriage?<eos> - Something must be done.<eos> - Madam, what is to be done?<eos> Captain Bisset is plainly proven to be guilty of adultery.<eos> We have put doubt in the jury's mind as to whether Sir Richard knew that the relations between you were established before the elopement and perhaps... the compensation could be reduced, by half, to 10,000.
But whatever the outcome... .. you will be shamed forevermore.<eos> I do not want to lose George.<eos> It will not touch my love for you.<eos> I must have time to think.<eos> What else may I do?<eos> Go to Sir Richard.<eos> Reason with him.<eos> Lady Worsley is here.<eos> What does she want of me?<eos> She wishes to see the child, and if you wished it, speak with you, Sir Richard.
What does she want of me?<eos> She wishes to see the child, and if you wished it, speak with you, Sir Richard.<eos> Richard, do you not think it wise to hear her?<eos> Sir Richard Worsley wishes it to be known to Lady Worsley that the child is not here.<eos> And in any case, if the child were here,<eos> Lady Worsley would not be permitted to see the child.<eos> For Lady Worsley has forgone all her maternal rights and Sir Richard is no longer obliged, nor is he disposed<eos> to grant them.<eos> Furthermore, Sir Richard wishes it to be known that Lady Worsley's visitation is a further cruel and vicious act perpetrated upon his person and he will inform the Lord Justice in the morning.<eos> I will have you, Richard Worsley!
- Do you believe this cheeky fellow?<eos> - I assure you, it is the truth.<eos> And you are to stand in the by-elections, for Newport?<eos> - What of it?<eos> - I wish you to know that you will have my vote.<eos> That is all.<eos> Gentlemen, whilst some in Parliament may baulk to call themselves a Tory, I am proud to do so.<eos> It has been an honour to offer myself for you as a candidate for your favour.<eos> And gentlemen, know this.<eos> If I should have the honour of being freely elected by you, I shall, when your service requires it, be at your service for ever more.
Lady Worsley came to the bathhouse when they was in Maidstone, sir.<eos> Did she come on her own?<eos> No, sir, she came with Sir Richard and Captain Bisset.<eos> All three, together.<eos> ...Sir! ... Shh!<eos> - Richard!<eos> - Seymour, Seymour!<eos> Bisset would like to do something.<eos> - What?<eos> Bisset would like to watch you.
Proudly continue to strive to be the great city that we want to be.<eos> To have the future we deserve.<eos> For generations of tomorrow, all across Philadelphia.<eos> And so, as we celebrate the founding of our great city, the birthplace of democracy...<eos> He'll be done in 15 minutes.<eos> Leave with the crowd, then rendezvous in the alley behind the Masonic Temple.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> And, Mark...<eos> The Rezident has a dozen men out there at City Hall as an insurance policy.<eos> If you and Katya aren't here within ten minutes of that speech ending, he's going to come after you... or Sarah.
But... we weren't wrong.<eos> Alex, don't.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> What'd you say?<eos> Mikhail's laptop was in City Hall.<eos> The SVR just beat us to it.<eos> Really?<eos> Okay, well, just dump that bucket of proof right over my head.<eos> Then shut the hell up and let me tell you what's gonna happen next.<eos> You and you and whoever else in this room who was behind you in this, are gonna go before that judge, and you're gonna own this screwup.
Why not?<eos> I-I just...<eos> What?<eos> Is he a security concern?<eos> He's not connected to the Russians, is he?<eos> No, nothing like that.<eos> Then what?<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> I...<eos> I'm not sure what's going on between you two, but I do know this, if we lose focus on how precarious our situation is, just for a moment, we lose everything, and I mean everything!
Valentine Michael Manson.<eos> [Manson] We will color his soul with everything we know, everything we are.<eos> We will be his only teachers, and one day... [chuckles] we will be his students.<eos> [Garrick] The Medal of Valor is given to those officers who embody the finest qualities of the Los Angeles Police Department.<eos> Tonight, we award it to Detective Samson Benedictus Hodiak.<eos> [Manson] And with him, we will lead the world to a bright, beautiful light... of a new age.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Detective, I just want to say congratulations.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm with Internal Affairs. There was a witness, so I'm gonna need to speak to you tomorrow.
I've been enlightened in more ways than you can describe.<eos> And please don't describe anymore.<eos> No, no.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> You're doing that wrong.<eos> You stand over here.<eos> This has gotta be exactly like that, okay?<eos> - All of them.<eos> - J.T. Thompson.<eos> We're here to speak to you.
Move, move, move!<eos> One of your new tablecloths was covered in Peter's DNA.<eos> DNA you tried to hide by taking it to the cleaners.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> We have witnesses that can place you at the laundromat.<eos> And we know that you were always fighting with Peter.<eos> What happened?<eos> Too many cooks in the kitchen?<eos> Disagreements between a chef and his sous are not uncommon.<eos> I think something went down between the two of you.
I went in to open up the restaurant.<eos> I found him in the freezer, stiff as a board, I figured he locked himself in there by accident.<eos> And why didn't you call 911?<eos> Well, there wasn't a hell of a lot that anyone could've done for him at that point.<eos> You know, it is tough enough owning a restaurant.<eos> What do you think would happen if someone found out that somebody died in there?<eos> I could lose everything that Carmen and I built up together.<eos> He busted his ass for you, what, 80, 90 hours a week in the kitchen?<eos> You find him like that and you just throw him in the trash?<eos> What's wrong with you?
Well, he could have been talking about the night his son died, not the morning he found out.<eos> Or he found out about Eddie's suicide because...<eos> Dash cam footage from the night Eddie Duncan decided he was gonna try and tackle a train.<eos> You were at the train tracks that night.<eos> You saw your son's mutilated body and you snapped.<eos> No.<eos> You told me.<eos> I mean, until then, I just thought he was just out on one of his...<eos> Please stop lying.<eos> We have video of you at the train tracks.
Yatta.<eos> Nathan, you must take your mom and Caspar somewhere far away from here.<eos> What about you?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I will always be with you.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Saying good-bye.<eos> You can't.<eos> Living with you, the both of you, is more than I could have ever asked for.
If you add money laundering, Chechen, Khayed and imamen- -As can be an assignment that has gone awry.<eos> -Khayed Might want to jump off.<eos> -A Terrorist cell has imploded.<eos> Do you know what the target of a terrorist cell could be?<eos> We have noticed the escalating activity and have inserted extrastyrkor the government offices and embassies.<eos> We see if the prosecutor can obtain a request for accessory to murder. Or an ad because he is here illegally.<eos> Our reconnaissance case of a murder, we can be of assistance so ...<eos> For our part, you are welcome to reassure you.<eos> We put him in the system and see what we intercepts.<eos> We continue to work in parallel with you.
He looks like the dead in the woods.<eos> Try to get more of him.<eos> I try to keep track of which activities available at Trefast.<eos> Find someone on Trefast we can talk with who has an eye on staff.<eos> Since I do not know who Ibrahim is I have no idea.<eos> Why has he drawings of our premises?<eos> -If You would guess?<eos> -No Idea.<eos> Is there a threat we need to know.<eos> We will contact you if there is something you need to know.
Previously on 12 Monkeys...<eos> She took Elena from me.<eos> I'm not gonna let you take my son.<eos> He didn't kill them.<eos> Daddy thought he did.<eos> I remember meeting you in 1987.
You got Elena killed, our son!<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Whole world's gonna die.<eos> You!<eos> Me!<eos> Cassie!<eos> Enough!<eos> Just when I was starting to get bored.<eos> About that thing in the hallway.<eos> So these guys aren't with you?
_<eos> How are you?<eos> Time isn't perfect.<eos> Yet I'm envious how most of you seem to defy it.<eos> Have your memory sessions garnered anything new?<eos> There's a company that manufactures the virus...<eos> Markridge.<eos> We should invest.<eos> The silent partner is no more.<eos> It's an honor to meet you.
Want to move cultivated samples of M-510 to another location.<eos> I think the Night Room is vulnerable.<eos> Call Peters.<eos> Maybe he'll take that CIA deal.<eos> Uh, about Jennifer... the security footage clearly shows she didn't kill those...<eos> Jennifer is exactly where she needs to be.<eos> Am I clear?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> _<eos> I remember meeting you in 1987, 28 years ago.
What happened to her?<eos> She got out again.<eos> Found her living on the streets, hiding behind a dumpster like a dog.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> "Hiding behind a dumpster like a dog."<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, let me out!<eos> Hello, Jennifer.<eos> How was your bath?<eos> I've wanted to meet you for some time.
This is not a predict.<eos> Resetting coordinates, sending Mr. Cole to 2015.<eos> Initiating splinter sequence... now.<eos> Good luck, James.<eos> _<eos> Jones...<eos> Not now, Mr. Whitley.<eos> I think we should have a drink.<eos> You don't drink.<eos> I told you that if I did, it'd be with you.
Katarina...<eos> What are you gonna do with that?<eos> Jones.<eos> _<eos> What is this place?<eos> That's home.<eos> That's a lot of security... more than we ever saw at a Markridge facility.<eos> How the hell do we get in?<eos> Exhaust tunnels.<eos> Mr. Seki, it is a great pleasure to finally meet you, sir.
We funded the construction of your gym.<eos> Ah, you must come back later if you wish to see it.<eos> The men are using it right now.<eos> Actually, I'm here to see the imam.<eos> Is he expecting you?<eos> I'm sure he'll find time for me.<eos> Sheikh Hafiz Al Haria is a very famous scholar.<eos> Please tell him it's urgent.<eos> Please wait here.<eos> Sheikh Hafiz will see you.
But Drawlight is not a magician.<eos> Surely a common-law court...<eos> No. His crimes were specifically magical crimes.<eos> We require a magical court.<eos> What other security do I have?<eos> When people attack me in the street?<eos> When other magicians - evil magicians - might arise to challenge my authority, to contradict me?<eos> I have to have a court of my own.<eos> Mr Norrell, it is not the duty of any court to exalt one person's opinions above another's.<eos> If other magicians think differently from you, you must battle it out with them.
No.<eos> Those pictures don't prove anything.<eos> Oh, I think the Dean's office will feel differently.<eos> I'm sure they're gonna want to know why you've been persecuting the new, deaf kids.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> You're deaf?<eos> Ugh.<eos> Hey, come on.<eos> Getting hazed is all part of the experience.<eos> You wouldn't want me to treat you differently than the other freshmen, would you?
Well, then where are we supposed to go?<eos> To the athletic center next door.<eos> No, no. No way.<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> All right, cool.<eos> Yeah, nice knowing you.<eos> Wait!<eos> Um, okay.<eos> I got an idea.<eos> We'll play you for it.
Major Rogers.<eos> I was wondering if you'd know my face.<eos> To what do I owe this gift?<eos> Oh. Rest assured, boy, I mean your master no ill will.<eos> In fact, I come to congratulate him upon his recent most deserved appointment as general of the Continental Army.<eos> Major, what is it you want?<eos> I come to offer my service to America.<eos> I cannot endorse your methods.<eos> No, no, no, no, George.<eos> The same beast in me dwells in you, George.

Die!<eos> Next.<eos> Just take the keys and go.<eos> Not you. You're coming with me.<eos> Why?<eos> I think I'll keep you for insurance.<eos> Just go!<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> Just get everyone to safety.<eos> I'll come back for you.
~ Well, according to your notes she set up the guillotine at a quarter past seven, but according to Dottie's notes, she was reading fortunes at the ticket box until the show started at 7:30.<eos> ~ Dottie's notes?<eos> ~ Dottie's notes, yes, sir.<eos> Ah, well, good.<eos> Good.<eos> Let's get her in.<eos> I already have, sir.<eos> She's waiting in the interview room.<eos> Jack!<eos> May I finish my conversation with you?
Without a doubt.<eos> He's a better flyer than James ever was.<eos> He can loop the loop and barrel roll like a bird.<eos> Does Willis smoke?<eos> No, never.<eos> Mac was right, Jack.<eos> She was poisoned.<eos> By her own cigarettes.<eos> I found that at the back of Willis Jones' desk.<eos> The packet's a match for the cigarette you found near the victim's body.
You can see now why Compton needs to be discreet.<eos> No, I don't see.<eos> A woman is dead and he's asking you to withhold information from me.<eos> If he won't cooperate with the police, I'll go over his head.<eos> You seem determined to make this a personal matter.<eos> And you seem determined to make it a military one.<eos> I don't understand why you have to dance to his tune.<eos> Ahem.<eos> Excuse me, Miss Fisher.<eos> Mr Butler just called to let you know that Group Captain Compton would like to see you, urgently.
If you treat him nicely, he won't bite.<eos> Help yourself to as much as you like, Paddy.<eos> Well, you've fallen on your feet, haven't you?<eos> ~ When was the last time you ate?<eos> ~ This morning. Well, you're doing a lot better than me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Paddy's brother Ned is about 5'2", sandy hair, blue eyes, should be wearing the Bottle Top Boy symbol.<eos> Whistle if you see him.<eos> The more things change, the more they stay the same.<eos> Don't worry, Miss, I'll look after you.
~ It was my dad's. ~ (Footsteps approach)<eos> Paddy just told them the news, Miss.<eos> Thank you, Dot. Why don't you take Paddy home and get him settled in?<eos> I can manage now.<eos> Now, you've all heard Badger is dead, and Ned is still missing.<eos> If anyone knows anything, it would be better to tell it to me now before the police find out.<eos> What about Mr Archie Woods, from the hospital, do you know him?<eos> Badger used to do odd jobs for him.<eos> Who's the smoker?<eos> Ah, sir, I've been meaning to talk to you about my... .. ah, career in the police force.
Mr B? What are your plans now, Ned?<eos> The Inspector said I got a good chance of probation for what I done to Badger.<eos> He's quitting the Bottle Top Boys and looking for a job.<eos> That's wonderful!<eos> If you've won over the Inspector, you're halfway there.<eos> I'm sure that Mr Butler can put you to work if you have any trouble.<eos> Well, as long as we lock up the silver, Miss.<eos> Come along, boys, I have a job for you.<eos> Don't worry, Dot, I'm sure Hugh will be back on deck in no time.<eos> He talked to you?
I have an appointment at the docks.<eos> What, nosing around?<eos> Don't worry, Jack, if I find anything, ~ you will be the first to know.<eos> ~ No, I'll be the last.<eos> I'm more concerned about you getting in too deep.<eos> Who, me?<eos> Look, these people have been killing each other for generations...<eos> I'll be careful.<eos> Promise me you'll be careful too.<eos> I thought I was dealing with you two clowns.
How do you do?<eos> Phryne Fisher.<eos> And this is Inspector Robinson.<eos> I think a reflection session would be calming for the ladies, Harriet, hm?<eos> I won't be long.<eos> Eric.<eos> Please meet Eric Edwards, our solicitor.<eos> I'm sure Miss Fisher needs no introduction.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> It's an honour to meet you at last.
Oh, the heart is a fickle thing.<eos> Better hurry, miss, eurhythmics dancing will be over in a couple of minutes.<eos> A lemon button fern, Dot.<eos> We're looking for lemon button fern.<eos> Ah-ha.<eos> 'Perkins Percussor.'<eos> I think all our murder weapons should be labelled.<eos> What is it, miss?<eos> Well... remember that time Ronaldo the rodeo rider came to supper and, um... you came to my rescue?<eos> I thought he was doing something awful to you.
What do you mean, Dr Littleton?<eos> Your lawyer can fill in the finer points.<eos> I have just come from an extraordinary meeting of the board.<eos> You've been struck off.<eos> I congratulate you on your doggedness, Wilbur.<eos> Did you really think that I would abandon my daughter to your depraved ideologies?<eos> I'll send a car round for you this afternoon.<eos> ~ This is terrible.<eos> ~ It'll be alright, Harrie.<eos> They cannot do this to you, Hayden.
~ Two o'clock.<eos> ~ You sound very sure.<eos> That's because I am.<eos> Has Miss Lombard ever said anything to you about wanting to harm Constance Burrows?<eos> Don't you mean Belinda?<eos> It appears the intended victim was Constance.<eos> Connie?<eos> 'Connie?<eos> We used to play mixed doubles together.<eos> But that's all there was between you?
Inspector!<eos> Fabulous shot of you and Miss Fisher in The Globe today.<eos> Are you exclusively Phryne's ball boy or do you spread yourself around?<eos> Only a glass?<eos> You gave Fredrick Burn a whole flask.<eos> I wouldn't have thought he was your type.<eos> You got that right.<eos> I prefer a man with a gun in his hand.<eos> Then why offer him your good whisky?<eos> There's something between you, isn't there?
How could I tell you?<eos> You'd want me to keep it and get married and settle down.<eos> I didn't want any of that!<eos> But we were in love!<eos> I loved playing tennis with you!<eos> You used to be good.<eos> How could tennis matter this much?<eos> Because tennis is everything!<eos> It's the only thing that ever mattered, the only thing I love, and if I hadn't been so stupid and wound up pregnant, I could have been champion of the world!<eos> We'll need to speak to you, Mr Burrows, in regards to withholding information.
Well, if it's all expanding, England will move further away.<eos> But it all looks very still to me.<eos> That's because you're not a telescope.<eos> - Is that supposed to be a compliment?<eos> - More like a romantic overture.<eos> - Is that the best that you can do?<eos> - Would you like me to improve on it?<eos> More than anything.<eos> Jack.<eos> Behind you.
Ah-ha! Welcome, welcome. - Oh, they're here!<eos> - Josh, Tom, and Hannah, these are my parents. - Hello!<eos> That's Donna and Bruce, and you remember Steve.<eos> Hi. Bruce.<eos> And what's your name, fella?<eos> - Tom.<eos> - Tom.<eos> Brilliant.<eos> Um... Hannah. Yeah.<eos> Lovely to meet you. And josh. - Hello.
It was having to hang out alone Every year with you and dad and peg just pecking at me.<eos> Just peck, peck, peck, peck, peck.<eos> -We're just trying to have a good time.<eos> -I know.<eos> I know I'm being unfair and I'm sorry, okay?<eos> But fuck, when I say to you "I don't want to talk about it," Why can't you stop talking about it?<eos> -Son, this is about arnold and ben.<eos> Actually I thought I was pretty clear. Okay?<eos> This is about you.<eos> I'm frustrated with you, okay?
-Yes, it is.<eos> -Josh, why don't you admit you love your dad?<eos> -I love you, dad.<eos> -I love you, too, josh.<eos> Just let me know if you need me to sign anything.<eos> Hi, I'm looking for my friend's room.<eos> Ben robinson.<eos> -Oh, lovely.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Sorry, I don't know why I said it like I was checking with you.
-Oh, okay.<eos> -Get your own cupboard!<eos> -Cheers, guys!<eos> -Okay, so I know you don't want to talk about it.<eos> I just want to make sure that you are okay.<eos> -Yeah!<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> I'm drinking champagne in the sky on a ferris wheel.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> -Meanwhile, what's going on with you two?
I woke up this morning, and I... I bitched at him for not buying bread.<eos> I had no idea...<eos> No idea.<eos> I won't say there's a bright side, but at least you get to say goodbye.<eos> Not everyone gets the chance.<eos> I'm supposed to be strong now, right?<eos> I'm supposed to go in there and... Sit peacefully beside him until he... dies.<eos> And all I want to do is scream.<eos> He just wanted to protect you.<eos> And he wanted his last days with you to be happy.
Trust me, Beretti don't care about you.<eos> This is about a war he started with Lucious a long time ago, and now he's just trying to settle the score.<eos> So I trust that you will make the right decision for your career.<eos> Your son blew me away. I mean, you must be so incredibly proud of him.<eos> I mean... Jamal is...<eos> A beast. He is.<eos> You know, I brought Delphine to Empire six years ago, before she blew up.<eos> - Your A-and-R girl wouldn't sign her.<eos> - Yeah, well, that A-and-R girl is no longer with us.<eos> And I will be handling you personally. Oh, wow.
Well, I used to take Tom every year.<eos> It was our tradition.<eos> He loved how loud it got.<eos> She used to hate the noise.<eos> You remember?<eos> You'd make us take you, and then you'd cry the whole time.<eos> Dad.<eos> I know... you love it now.<eos> And I don't want to miss it, so can we go?<eos> Well, you sure this is okay... me coming along?
Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> Bone cancer.<eos> He never even said a word.<eos> I will, uh, be going to Los Angeles before heading up to San Francisco, see if I can be of any help.<eos> Sir, if there's anything I can do...<eos> Well, I would appreciate it, Penelope, if, uh, you don't tell the rest of the team about this, not just yet.<eos> Of course.<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> So, now Hotch as well will not be joining us today.<eos> He is going to meet you at the airport, and actually, Rossi-- that doesn't matter.
- This is Theo's.<eos> - Nice. When is he moving in?<eos> - This is Winnie's room.<eos> - Wow!<eos> - Has she read all of these?<eos> - No idea, ask her.<eos> "Wetlands."<eos> Geography, an interesting topic.<eos> Mr. Horst?<eos> Mr. Klina. There's something I'd like to talk to you about.
Let me go!<eos> Please.<eos> Mr. Klina!<eos> May I ask what it is you're doing?<eos> I have a complaint.<eos> I'm thirsty and my drink is stuck in this shitty...<eos> - Mr. Klina!<eos> We have to go.<eos> - No. Mr. Klina will first talk with me about his kids.<eos> Why should I talk to you about my kids?
You sit up straight.<eos> - I hate you.<eos> - And you stink.<eos> We're building a raft.<eos> Can't you just shut your face?<eos> The air is good.<eos> Isn't it, kids?<eos> Isn't the air good?<eos> Mr. Klina, now that it's just the two of us, do you have time to talk about a building project?<eos> - Why would I do that with you?
Mr. Horst, I'm definitely not going to do that now.<eos> - But it's important to me.<eos> - Please...<eos> - Mr. Klina, please.<eos> - Why...<eos> Can you not talk about work for once?<eos> Theo, it's not about work, it's about human lives, - okay?<eos> - Watch your tone.<eos> You're the nanny...<eos> You're never there to talk to!
- Who let her go to the party?<eos> - I did.<eos> - Yes, you.<eos> - Because she's in love.<eos> - She's what?<eos> - Your daughter is in love!<eos> Nonsense.<eos> How would you know that?<eos> Because she told me...<eos> Wonder why your kids don't talk to you?
And I have a surprise for you.<eos> I thought we could take a trip together this weekend.<eos> - With Rolf?<eos> - No.<eos> I had to let Rolf go.<eos> - We want to keep Rolf.<eos> - Clemens, you said the nanny stays.<eos> That's right, I did say that, but we don't need a nanny anymore.<eos> I'll look after you from now on.<eos> I'll be here for you.
That's all.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> You've been so sweet and understanding to me.<eos> Um, do you think I could buy you a drink sometime to say thank you?<eos> Just a drink.<eos> Please follow me.<eos> Look, don't ever call here, but just take this number, and if you ever need anything, just ask for Charlie Bullman.<eos> For anything.<eos> All right, I'm going to the schoolyard.<eos> Yeah, but why can't I come with you guys, too?
Well, weren't they about his age when they started running numbers for Mr. Dolan?<eos> That was different.<eos> We didn't have a father around.<eos> Yeah, but James does.<eos> So, please let me do my job.<eos> - How you doing, Boss?<eos> - All right.<eos> Take a look at table two.<eos> Hey, Mr. O'Bannon, how's it going?<eos> I wanted to talk to you.
To be honest, I can't tell if this kid is a complete stunad or if he's trying to play me.<eos> But what I do know is that he thinks he knows everything and he don't know dick, and that concerns me.<eos> As well it should.<eos> So until we dig a little deeper on him, don't take him anywhere we can be embarrassed.<eos> My suggestion is this, Cap... we give it seven days to see if the kid is worth keeping, if that works for you and the Boss.<eos> We don't need this smartass causing us any headaches.<eos> Muldoon, why don't you have a little talk with him?<eos> Get a feel for this college prick.<eos> See if he has any clue what this job's about.<eos> I'll leave it to you three to make the call.
That shows a lot of faith in you, that's wonderful.<eos> Wait, all the photos that are gonna be on the mantle forever and ever?<eos> Yes, all of the photos.<eos> All of the photos.<eos> - You're gonna take?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You're sure?<eos> - Yes, I'm absolutely certain.<eos> That's really incredible.<eos> Also, Hank says I need to have a talk with the both of you about whether or not I should get the money now or it should be put in an account for when I am 18.
The very best.<eos> (Sarah) Careful.<eos> (Hank) He's got a little assistant, I like that.<eos> I like it, Max.<eos> Aunt Sarah, move to the right more.<eos> Into the light.<eos> Further, further.<eos> - Don't be so far away.<eos> - Does he come with me or...?<eos> Yes, he should come with you.
We just keep picturing you playing with the baby in our backyard.<eos> We live near the wharf and...<eos> I was thinking about taking zeek down to golden gate park and teaching him how to play baseball.<eos> You know?<eos> Wait, what...<eos> what are you guys suggesting?<eos> We want you to come live with us, Amber.<eos> No... not... are you serious?<eos> Oh, guys, no, I couldn't...<eos> I couldn't do that to you.
You know?<eos> Wait, what...<eos> what are you guys suggesting?<eos> We want you to come live with us, Amber.<eos> No... not... are you serious?<eos> Oh, guys, no, I couldn't...<eos> I couldn't do that to you.<eos> This... this is your big third act!<eos> I mean, we would ruin any semblance of peace you had in your home.<eos> I couldn't do that to you guys.
It pays decent, so... don't oversell it.<eos> [Laughs] Any job that pays decent right now is a good job.<eos> Well, whatever you take, I... I hope it makes you as happy as you were the other day when I saw you teaching those kids.<eos> Yeah.<eos> (Drew) Um, hi everyone.<eos> My name's drew. I am the best man tonight.<eos> [Cheers and applause] Thank you, guys.<eos> - Best man ever. Yeah!<eos> - The world's best man!<eos> (Drew) Um, Hank, I very much enjoyed getting to know you.
The high priest of the temple.<eos> Can't it wait until after I've eaten?<eos> No, I'm afraid it can't.<eos> This is a matter of some urgency.<eos> "Urgent" appears to be your default state of mind, Caiaphas.<eos> We live in turbulent times, Governor.<eos> I have a request.<eos> Another one?<eos> Please tell me it doesn't concern the Nazarene.<eos> I'm certainly grateful for the decisive manner in which you've acted on our behalf so far.
Do we stay or go?<eos> Romans!<eos> We need to leave.<eos> Wait.<eos> We need to calm down.<eos> We cannot rule out that the tomb was opened and emptied by the authorities to flush us out and round us up.<eos> I saw him.<eos> Who?<eos> Jesus.<eos> He spoke to me, as clearly as I'm speaking to you now.
Great guilt because I wasn't with him at the end.<eos> And shame!<eos> I so want to tell him I'm sorry.<eos> Peace be with you.<eos> Rabbi!<eos> Can't you believe your do you think you're looking at a ghost?<eos> What ghost carries flesh and bones?<eos> Any food? Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> This is what I told you while I was with you.
I know.<eos> No.<eos> Thomas, he was here.<eos> What?<eos> Jesus was just here in this room.<eos> He broke bread with us.<eos> Are you playing a sick joke on me because I'm the last to get back?<eos> No.<eos> So, Jesus...<eos> Was here with you all?
Later, exciting stuff!<eos> Exciting stuff?<eos> Is something exciting happening tonight?<eos> - Hey, Stosh.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> Is my love for darts not well documented at this point?<eos> Okay, well, maybe you should just...<eos> Join you guys for the next game?
And number seven, our most recent- - Missy Bowers.<eos> Get everything you can on Vanessa Gillerman.<eos> She's been with our target the longest.<eos> Maybe you could find someone in her life who can give me some insight into her.<eos> I hated her for leaving me with that pedophile, but now I get it.<eos> This diary is heartbreaking.<eos> Your father started abusing you and Vanessa when you were four years old?<eos> Truth is, I've locked that part of my life away and thrown away the key.<eos> I have a suspicion Vanessa has, too.<eos> Look, Juliet, I know the last thing that you want to do is dig up the most painful part of your past, but if you want to see your sister again, I need you to remind her of what you two lived through.
That's just ridiculous.<eos> Why would someone that beautiful work in a dump like this?<eos> Did you see her back tattoo?<eos> Working here ain't the first bad choice she's made.<eos> Yeah, you don't need to read Chinese to know that tat says "damaged goods""<eos> Do you mind?<eos> That's someone's daughter.<eos> The pierced tongue tells me Daddy hasn't been in the picture for quite a while.<eos> Well, she could sit on my lap and tell Papa Carl all about it.<eos> What are you doing?
I didn't want to get anyone's hopes up, in case we didn't get the time.<eos> Callie's gonna have to want to do this.<eos> We can't pressure her into it.<eos> We won't.<eos> - It's ultimately up to her.<eos> - Let's talk to her tonight.<eos> Oh. Hey.<eos> I was looking for you.<eos> Uh, Monte, this is my wife, Stef.<eos> It's so nice to meet you.
Uh, hey, guys, we're having a little bit of a private conversation.<eos> Uh, OK, sorry.<eos> OK, yeah, I should probably get home anyway.<eos> See you later, Connor.<eos> There's nowhere to be alone in this house.<eos> Hey, if we sneak out, tomorrow night after TP'ing, we could hangout, you know, by ourselves.<eos> So what would I have to do?<eos> First we get you off probation, your hearing is next week and your P.O. sees no reason that it won't go well.<eos> Then, you have to prove that you can pay for an apartment and support yourself.<eos> I can't live with you?
Like a criminal who gloves up and files a serial number off a gun, you took every cyber precaution to hide yourself.<eos> But, like most criminals, you made a mistake-- using a burn phone to text Zoey's father.<eos> We traced the serial number from that phone right back to you.<eos> You can't prove any of what you're saying.<eos> Even I know that burner phones are untraceable.<eos> But what you don't know is that the first time you connect a phone with a computer, it logs that activity.<eos> Leaves a digital trace.<eos> A cyber fingerprint.<eos> You plugged your burner phone into this computer minutes before texting Zoey's father.<eos> We know he ended his relationship with you.
Jordan, it's gonna be okay.<eos> She's gonna make it, Jordan.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Zoey's gonna be okay.<eos> I'm gonna be leaving social media for awhile, so this will be the last video I'm posting.<eos> For those of you who care, surgery went well.<eos> Besides a gnarly scar and a couple months on crutches, doctors say that I'm going to be fine.<eos> Better than fine.<eos> To everyone who cyberbullied me, know that your words mean something.<eos> That cruel comment that you type without second thought could destroy someone's life.
The CIA's patching him through.<eos> This is Agent Rosenberg.<eos> He's our hostage negotiator.<eos> Tread lightly, Agent Rosenberg.<eos> Those are my people inside there.<eos> Understood, and they're gonna be fine.<eos> We're gonna take our time, hear what he has to say, and get everyone out alive.<eos> You ready?<eos> Mr. Braxton, this is Agent Phillip Rosenberg.<eos> The Director of NCS has instructed me to open a dialogue with you.
So you need to help us to make it hold.<eos> These walls, you built them.<eos> So you've already done the impossible.<eos> Carter.<eos> Please.<eos> Hey, what you said before about us needing to take care of ourselves?<eos> Going out finding more people, that is taking care of ourselves.<eos> Your call, though.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You know, I can come with all of you.
Drunk.<eos> Been there.<eos> Ah, I'm just busting your balls.<eos> I look the other way to save you trouble.<eos> You've been overlooking criminal activity because of backstrom? Sure.<eos> Me and backstrom are cut from the same cloth.<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Your cloth smells like dead fish.<eos> What matters is we get the job done.<eos> So, whatever happens between you and valentine and trippi, I figure you're handling it.
We are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system-- a Machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
Why?<eos> You done something wrong?<eos> You know I haven't.<eos> Then why arrest you?<eos> We'll have to leave the tea, though, I'm afraid.<eos> Duty calls.<eos> Vivid misdeeds in Hackney Wick.<eos> Give me a second.<eos> You and Alice Morgan.<eos> I'm aware that, um, there was a... fondness between you.
Anna: Cicero.<eos> Luke, if you and Cicero will bring my things upstairs.<eos> I believe the northeast bedroom is still unoccupied.<eos> That's all right.<eos> I'll assist her.<eos> Mrs. Strong, it's good to see you.<eos> Does this mean you'll be taking up residence again?<eos> Uh, I didn't feel comfortable at Whitehall after the major's kidnapping.<eos> I can only imagine how shocking that must have been.<eos> If anything had happened to you, I never could have forgiven myself.
During your absence, he offered me his friendship.<eos> And, well... it grew into something else.<eos> Something romantic.<eos> I know this may come as a shock, but I came to care for him deeply.<eos> And to think... how he must be suffering.<eos> Captain Wakefield knows where he's being held, but will do nothing.<eos> But you have your own force of men and if you...<eos> You wish for me to rescue Major Hewlett?<eos> The man who had me court-martialed?<eos> I know the two of you have had your disagreements.
Well, if you're planning on making a scene, be my guest.<eos> Just don't expect it to do any good.<eos> You see, these people are my friends.<eos> It'll only take a few seconds for you to be removed.<eos> I'm not here to make a scene, Del.<eos> I just wanted to tell you to enjoy it all while it lasts.<eos> And what makes you think it's not going to last?<eos> Carrie Morse, Stacey Goff,<eos> Vivian Russell-- we know about them.<eos> It's only a matter of time before we connect you to one of their murders.
I saw the foundation was hosting an event tonight, and I thought I'd come and say hello.<eos> How do you know Joan?<eos> Oh, my colleagues and I paid her a visit today.<eos> We had a very interesting conversation.<eos> Actually, we didn't.<eos> Um, they thought you and I had a problem.<eos> I told them they couldn't be more wrong.<eos> I was just coming to let you know the silent auction is wrapping up, so...<eos> Oh, I was just leaving.<eos> I wouldn't bid on any vacations if I were you.
I'm so horny, Phil.<eos> Hmm?<eos> I mean, after something like this happens, you realize how necessary it is to be... you know, just touched and held and kissed.<eos> I would saw off my right arm to make out with a dude.<eos> I would, too.<eos> I would, too.<eos> It's natural.<eos> You know, that's why I'm so happy for you and Carol.<eos> No, but...<eos> I mean, I know that it's not perfect between you guys, but at least you have each other.
You have...<eos> - What do you say, Daphne'?<eos> Really?<eos> Sure, thanks.<eos> Bay. She sure left in a hurry.<eos> Well, at least I have you here, Fred, ta...<eos> Hey, Zip.<eos> Cult. - Yau guys going to the bridge?<eos> - Yeah, but there's really...<eos> Great, I'll join you.
I'm not scared, if that's what you're worried about.<eos> Get out of my bar!<eos> Come on, just kiss me.<eos> You kissed my boyfriend.<eos> Kiss me!<eos> Kiss me!<eos> You kiss me, girl!<eos> - Kiss me!<eos> - Stop!<eos> What is wrong with you guys?
Who the hell are you people?<eos> And what are you doing in my room?<eos> We've been invaded.<eos> Shanghaied!<eos> Some goddamn New Yorker is sizing up my suite.<eos> A little early for you, isn't it?<eos> I know you'll prefer the view from the space we just saw, but here's the other half of the floor plan.<eos> The lighting is, of course, a challenge and I don't know if all this neon is the answer.<eos> Will Drake.<eos> I am so pleased to meet you.
Citizens of Pretty Lake, as you know, the situation is increasingly grave.<eos> We are still no closer to finding a cause for these deaths.<eos> Given the escalating death toll, starting immediately, we are putting Pretty Lake under full quarantine.<eos> Know this is not a decision that was taken lightly.<eos> A fence is in the process of being erected.<eos> In the meantime, our military will use whatever force necessary on anyone trying to enter or leave the area.<eos> This is for everyone's safety.<eos> Full details will be posted on our government's websites.<eos> We have called in experts from around the world and we are doing everything we can to figure this thing out.<eos> Make no mistake, this was an extraordinarily difficult decision, but know our thoughts and our prayers are with you.
When you getting more?<eos> I don't know, maybe when the fence comes down.<eos> Thanks.<eos> For nothing.<eos> Hey, no, no pushing, come on.<eos> You want it, get in line.<eos> Hi, Sarah.<eos> Hey, Jeremy.<eos> Two hamburgers.<eos> Who's looking after you?
Everybody, be quiet!<eos> Shut up!<eos> Thank you, Felix.<eos> We've just been sent this message.<eos> Citizens of Pretty Lake, right now we have confirmed reports that no one over 22 is left alive.<eos> We do not think that anyone still living in Pretty Lake has anything to fear.<eos> In the meantime, the most important thing that needs to be done is to gather all of the bodies and burn them.<eos> Full instructions will be posted on the town's website.<eos> I understand this is an awful and dreadful thing we ask you to do, but once the bodies have been burned, we hope that we will be able to lift the quarantine.<eos> The world is praying with you through your unimaginable loss.
What do you got?<eos> You can tell me, I can take it.<eos> I-I don't know if I can take it if...<eos> If you died, I'd be lost.<eos> J-Just tell me, I'll be there for you, I'm big and strong.<eos> - Is it cancer?<eos> - What's your problem?<eos> Oh, Schmidty, you have cancer?<eos> I can't watch you go through cancer, buddy, you're not strong enough.<eos> What is wrong with you?
I have a 3:15.<eos> Uh, I can't.<eos> I got to take Trevor to the eye doctor.<eos> He's getting glasses.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, this whole week is gonna be tough 'cause, uh, Helen and Vik went to Africa, and we got the kids till Sunday.<eos> Helen and Vik went to Africa?<eos> On safari.<eos> Go figure.<eos> Your ex-wife took off with her boyfriend and you have the children for a whole week?
You do?<eos> Yes, I...<eos> Helen once told me that when she reads obituaries, she's looking for whether the person loved and was loved.<eos> Did they have a family, were they married long, did they have children, grandchildren?<eos> And it kind of blew my mind at the time, 'cause it never occurred to me to judge someone by their family.<eos> Instead, you're looking at what?<eos> What they... what they did.<eos> Meaning their work, their accomplishments?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And yet, there's something about what Helen said that stayed with you, that... that makes you think she might be on to something.
He basically won the war for us.<eos> So do we judge him for his absence for his family and his infidelity, or do we just let that slide, because what does it matter at the end?<eos> The guy stopped Hitler.<eos> What does it matter to whom?<eos> There's a certain type of man that history reveres.<eos> We see it over and over.<eos> Jefferson, Hamilton, Picasso,<eos> Hemingway, all of them cheaters.<eos> It's like they have this bald desire, this... this willingness to take whatever they want, that ends up making them remarkable.<eos> But again, I want to understand how this connects to you.
I'm sure you're gonna get everything you want.<eos> If Bianca can do it, you can.<eos> To Bianca!<eos> And her new life.<eos> - Salud!<eos> - Salud!<eos> Sir?<eos> Do you think she can join us tomorrow?<eos> - The press are starting to ask.<eos> - If we win, it'll be strange if she isn't standing next to you for your victory speech.
What did the overnight internals say?<eos> Still a toss-up. Less than half a point gap.<eos> - Her or me?<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> The margin of error is four-point-five.<eos> The last few days, the lead's gone back and forth three times.<eos> Bottom line is turnout.<eos> - Sir?<eos> - Yes, I'm almost ready.<eos> May I speak to you for a moment privately?
Please.<eos> Please just let me go.<eos> - Please!<eos> Doug!<eos> Please!<eos> - Fuck!<eos> The president is on the line for you again.<eos> You told him I'm not feeling well?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> He'd still like to speak with you.
While Abe remains in the city, you'll have to transcribe his letters and Abigail's and put them both into the drop.<eos> While Abe remains in the city?<eos> I was just about to tell him that I can't do it.<eos> - Ben, I can't do it.<eos> - What?<eos> Why?<eos> Abe, you're studying the law.<eos> It's the perfect cover. If it were that simple, I'd be there already.<eos> All right? As it is, I can't stay for longer than a week, so...<eos> Look, whatever's happening between you two, it has to be put aside.
Let him go!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Come on! Come on!<eos> Don't touch it!<eos> Don't touch it!<eos> Come on, we've got to go.<eos> We've got to go.<eos> On your feet. On your feet.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - Your father said just to follow you.
Thanks.<eos> Let's have someone read.<eos> The young man in glasses, please.<eos> Italian would suit me.<eos> - That's mine.<eos> - It was on the floor.<eos> I thought it was yours.<eos> It is, but...<eos> Thanks.<eos> Can I come with you?
The gun from fitch's installation.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> He was commenting on boundaries, Creating a demilitarized zone for radical behavior.<eos> Mr. Brady, "demilitarized" means "without guns."<eos> Fitch is a scholar of the human condition In all of its contradictions.<eos> Fitch is a genius.<eos> Was a genius.<eos> That's what I mean.<eos> Such a bummer.<eos> We have reason to believe That there was a third person with you
Suddenly, you're an artist.<eos> No.<eos> I'm a master.<eos> Thanks for coming down again, ms.<eos> Anderson.<eos> This will take about a minute.<eos> Can I have your coat?<eos> I'll just hang it outside.<eos> Sure. Thank you.<eos> Lieutenant? We've got some new evidence I'd love to discuss with you.
- So, how do you two know each other?<eos> Zoila has been my housekeeper forever and a dear friend.<eos> But recently there's been a little hiccup in our relationship.<eos> - She fired me.<eos> - I briefly fired her.<eos> But I've apologized several times, and she still won't come back to work.<eos> After 20 years together, you threw me aside for a man.<eos> I hardly "threw" you.<eos> Does it look like I could throw her?<eos> Zoila, what do you see as the main problem between you and Genevieve?
And I think it might have given us our first real breakthrough.<eos> I know this area.<eos> Only one way in and out.<eos> Traffic cam records it all.<eos> You two need to leave here right now.<eos> There's trouble brewing here and I can't risk it following us.<eos> What kind of trouble?<eos> The bounty hunter kind.<eos> Go, now.<eos> I'll sort this and call you later.
I come with you.<eos> I drive you.<eos> Guys, for once: everyone together.<eos> Come here.<eos> Blinker, come here!<eos> Blinker, come here, man!<eos> No, let's go, let's go!<eos> Relax, for once.<eos> But we're taking her back first!<eos> Sonne, I want to go with you.
Are you serious?<eos> Who are you right now?<eos> _ _<eos> W...<eos> Emmett!<eos> W... where are you going?<eos> Your flight doesn't leave for three hours.<eos> _<eos> I'm sorry about my mom.<eos> For the record, I did not send her to come talk to you.
It's not an ambush.<eos> We're just checking in, seeing how you're doing.<eos> Want some cocoa?<eos> Thanks, I'm fine.<eos> So, you got your ankle monitor off.<eos> That had to have felt good.<eos> So good you went to a party and stayed out all night, and you didn't call us.<eos> Which I explained.<eos> And it's pretty clear you'd been drinking.<eos> I hate to break it to you guys, but I have had a drink before.
Outside right now!<eos> All right, everybody. To your positions.<eos> Got it!<eos> Stay here.<eos> Grab a lamp.<eos> We're gonna finish this.<eos> Move.<eos> Wait here.<eos> The Avocet vans are leaving.<eos> All right, Detective, you're on.
Somebody's watching us.<eos> Damn.<eos> We got comms.<eos> Mess decks, night vision.<eos> Clear!<eos> Clear!<eos> Clear!<eos> Everyone okay?<eos> Anyone hit?<eos> Any more where you came from, sailor?
Get lost.<eos> Call for backup.<eos> Is anyone in there?<eos> !<eos> We're here to help you!<eos> There are gonna be more where these guys came from.<eos> We can't stay here.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hey, Commodore.<eos> What's Lieutenant Foster doing with you?
I'm being pursued.<eos> I say again, I have at least six troopers on my tail.<eos> And I don't want to bring them your way.<eos> I'm gonna swing back around at Saratoga<eos> And... where am I?<eos> ... Fremont.<eos> Saratoga and Fremont!<eos> Master Chief, we have two vans now.<eos> You take one. I'll take the other.<eos> I promised the captain I'd look after you.
You want to be the last to die for a lost cause?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Shoot him!<eos> There are 200 more where I came from.<eos> You heard my X.O.<eos> We've taken back our ship, this building is ours, and we're telling the people of Baltimore that your killing zone at Olympia is out of business.<eos> You have two choices... a trial... or a funeral.<eos> I gave you a direct order.<eos> Shoot.<eos> I am not going anywhere with you.
Indie rock scene, country club.<eos> I fit in everywhere.<eos> There's our zombie powerbroker now.<eos> Oh, and Julien...<eos> Go ahead and take care of our little gym rat problem.<eos> I'd do it myself, but Lowell Tracey's invited me to preview the new Pocket Dial album.<eos> Who?<eos> You need to listen to something other than Bob Seger, my man.<eos> Mr. Kaiser?<eos> I didn't think I'd be sharing the ride to lunch with you.
Well... we gave it a shot, right?<eos> We came here hoping this would work out.<eos> Well, appreciate your time.<eos> Whoa! Whoa, what's that, hmm?<eos> That-that's for my blog.<eos> Fat Fucks Making Backroom Deals with Ex-con Businessmen dot-edu.<eos> Edu-- it's an educational Web site.<eos> It's a place where you go to learn stuff.<eos> Okay.<eos> Cool. Oh, no, no. I'm not making a deal with you.
Seattle's own Nirvana finds itself at the very top of "Billboard's" pop albums chart with its album "Nevermind,"<eos> while guitarist Kurt Cobain just got engaged to Courtney Love, front woman of an L.A. band called Hole.<eos> According to "Rolling Stone," Cobain fell ill with a stomach problem during their tour of four continents and had to cancel a number of dates in England.<eos> There's been speculation of summer tour plans, but so far, only the next Reading Festival in August.<eos> Nirvana is now retreating from doing interviews. Whether it's a reaction to "too much, too soon,"<eos> the band would rather their music speak for itself than be knighted as spokesmen for a generation.<eos> Right after you guys got married, they were the biggest band in the world, and Kurt decided to take six months off.<eos> So, officially, in the story that's out in the world, he took six months off of their touring schedule?<eos> He could have toured the world at that point and made a shitload of money. Oh, I see.<eos> To me, it seemed like he wanted to stay in an apartment with you and do heroin.
He'll be worried.<eos> Herrmann?<eos> How is everybody?<eos> Yeah, Severide said that there might be some kind of a... problem?<eos> Little Terrance... his lungs ain't working right.<eos> Doctors are all over it, so...<eos> They don't seem too worried.<eos> It's just... it's hard waiting, you know.<eos> Yeah, I get it. Uh...<eos> Listen, is there anybody there with you?
Alright.<eos> Pull it down.<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing?<eos> Murder!<eos> You can't do this Feraldo.<eos> This is crazy!<eos> This is our message.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Do it!<eos> We're with you!
He wanted me to kill him.<eos> He wanted me to see what he'd done.<eos> He wanted me to carry all of it.<eos> You know what?<eos> He got what he wanted.<eos> S01E10 Us and Them<eos> May Arthur be comforted in the cradle of heaven, and the abuses he suffered in this world be healed by his eternal life in the house of the lord.<eos> And let those that loved him know he is now blessed with the happiness and grace denied him in this world.<eos> Amen.<eos> Peace be with you.
Someone inside wearing a dark jacket.<eos> - Is that a logo?<eos> - Partial logo.<eos> Can you decipher it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Give me some time.<eos> Janice, let's get a unit on John's house and his ex-wife and his daughter.<eos> Let's keep them safe till we can figure something out.<eos> How's Emma?<eos> Well, the security company's gonna be with you guys 24 hours a day until they catch this guy.
John needs me.<eos> He doesn't need her.<eos> Is he gay?<eos> Is it romantic obsession?<eos> No.<eos> He worships him.<eos> He doesn't want anyone to be near John but him.<eos> No one's good enough.<eos> You didn't answer the question.<eos> After I spoke with you guys, I got scared for John, so I had to find out.
Help!<eos> Let me in!<eos> Help, help!<eos> Let me in!<eos> Is this what your attacker looked like?<eos> That's right.<eos> They all look like jesters.<eos> Traditionally, the duty of the Jester was to point out the folly of the king.<eos> You being the king in this scenario.<eos> Is it possible that someone in your administration could be upset with you?
Customers pay up to 3,000 a night to have a beautiful girl on their arm.<eos> You pay the service for a girl's time.<eos> Sex is arranged and paid for privately.<eos> Let's pay Alice Vargas a visit.<eos> I'm sorry, but I can't talk about my clients.<eos> The mayor sent us.<eos> He'd want you to be candid.<eos> Unfortunately, my service does not allow us to confirm or deny the identities of my clients.<eos> That's a good policy until it's not.<eos> I'm gonna level with you, Alice.
There was this one guy.<eos> A client?<eos> We only went out a few times.<eos> He was very controlling.<eos> He said he wanted to marry me and whisk me off to some fairytale life.<eos> Did you tell anyone?<eos> No.<eos> I broke it off, said I couldn't see him anymore.<eos> He screamed at me and told me I'd regret it.<eos> Has he contacted you lately?
How are you doing?<eos> I'm OK.<eos> I moved in with a friend while they clean up my place.<eos> I need to ask you about the mayor's wife.<eos> What about her?<eos> Did you know her?<eos> Have you ever met?<eos> Not that I remember.<eos> I mean, that would be kind of weird, don't you think?<eos> Has anyone ever contacted you, tried to get you to end the relationship?
Craig?<eos> He knows nothing about this.<eos> Is that true, Elaine, or did you tell Craig about the affair?<eos> We are a political family.<eos> We keep our dirty laundry in house, and when I found out that you and Sandra had a daughter, I was heartbroken.<eos> I couldn't talk to anyone.<eos> So you turned to Craig.<eos> He's always been there for me, but I had no idea how upset he'd be, and when you showed me that photo of the mask, I recognized his work immediately.<eos> Craig was so upset by your betrayal.<eos> That's why he went after you and Alice.
Oh, God.<eos> It works.<eos> Yvonne called a plumber?<eos> That's right.<eos> Wow, look at this.<eos> What are we drinking to?<eos> To us.<eos> To us.<eos> Hey.<eos> I need to talk to you.
Take care.<eos> You too, sir.<eos> Nino.<eos> Nino.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, no, I'm fine.<eos> I'm... I'm really sorry. I didn't see him there.<eos> Because he's two feet tall and he moves like a jackrabbit.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Are you sure you're okay?
That'd be cool.<eos> No, I'm just a P.O.D. Plain old deputy.<eos> But I was just walking past, and I thought you looked really familiar.<eos> You mind if I ask your name?<eos> Avery Markham.<eos> Markham! That's right...<eos> Avery Markham.<eos> You know what?<eos> When I was just a pup, I served some warrants on some of your men.<eos> And then you and I passed each other one day in the courtroom when that judge you paid off dismissed all the charges.
I'm just... thinking.<eos> I mean, it... It wouldn't make sense for you to kill Poole to slow down Grady's case just to turn around and kill Grady so that you could be with Katherine if...<eos> If I was just gonna leave Kentucky? Exactly.<eos> That was not an easy decision.<eos> I loved Katherine.<eos> Still do.<eos> Well, that's very sweet.<eos> But why leave?<eos> Unless. Maybe you didn't trust her.<eos> Or you didn't know what she was gonna do to you.
I will reach out and I will stay by my phone.<eos> All right?<eos> Get here when you can.<eos> Thank god.<eos> Hey! My brother's hurt real bad.<eos> We were hiking. He fell. He split his head open.<eos> There's... There's a lot of blood. Please.<eos> Okay, sir.<eos> Just give us a second.<eos> Let's see what's going on with you here, buddy.
- Well, you brought it.<eos> Well, I was told it was your favorite.<eos> Well, everybody's got to have a hobby.<eos> So, you were saying you're concerned my grandniece might be falling in with a bad element?<eos> I'm saying that people who associate with Boyd Crowder have a habit of coming to a violent end.<eos> I know your family's had its share of tragedy.<eos> My nephew's a sap.<eos> He got himself all moony-eyed over that idiot he married and got even more moony-eyed after she died.<eos> Not sure how she managed to grow a head on her shoulders - raised by that pair of nitwits.<eos> - If you don't mind my asking ... how is it Loretta ended up in foster care instead of coming here to live with you?
Well, ain't this the conundrum?<eos> Somebody's always got to go first.<eos> Now, it's clear that I've held up my end.<eos> What say we verify you've held up yours?<eos> Go on.<eos> Now, what say we see if we can all ride off into our respective sunsets?<eos> Katherine.<eos> - Boyd!<eos> - Katherine.<eos> Uh, ripping you off ... that was her idea from the jump ... payback for you murdering her husband.
I'm having trouble enough defending your actions even absent your and Ava's history.<eos> Just let me get on the helicopter, take one pass, see if I can spot 'em.<eos> They're close, Art.<eos> I'm telling you, I can feel it.<eos> They're close.<eos> All right. You know me so well.<eos> I'm sure you can understand my tone when I say to you let the goddamn helicopter go and get your ass back to Lexington right now.<eos> God damn it.<eos> - Are you Deputy Dunlop? - That's me.<eos> They say they got a deputy who wants to meet you outside.
Carl?<eos> That look good enough to you, you son of a bitch?<eos> - Wha... - Where's the money, Boyd?<eos> Why are you pointing a gun at me?<eos> I'm infirm.<eos> I trusted you.<eos> You sold Earl and I out.<eos> - You set the cops on us.<eos> - Who sold you that wooden nickel?<eos> Son, I had every intention of meeting you ...
I let you go, you gonna get your people, come back after me?<eos> Got any good reason why I shouldn't?<eos> - With what purpose in mind?<eos> - You saw 'em. They got nothing.<eos> They'll kill you for your boots.<eos> Give me that.<eos> In a couple days, you're gonna come to Arlo Givens' place, he's in the book.<eos> I'm signing it over to you.<eos> Y-You're giving me your house?<eos> He did you people dirt.
- I want him to come with me.<eos> - No. He'll be interrogated.<eos> - She's my wife.<eos> - Calm down.<eos> Let me pass.<eos> Emma!<eos> Hello, madam. You come from far.<eos> My baby.<eos> He's fine.<eos> And you're doing well.
They're more faithful.<eos> You're an optimist.<eos> You think I should be?<eos> I worked at the hospital.<eos> The patients were as faithful as the doctors.<eos> I got to see a couple of things. A true brothel!<eos> I don't like men anymore.<eos> I'll go to the store that sells these boxes.<eos> They might remember who bought this one.<eos> I'm coming with you.
You think the guy wanted to kill you!<eos> I already screwed up once.<eos> I can't just ignore the other girl.<eos> What are you doing with that?<eos> Autopsy Report<eos> After what happened to you, I wonder if it was a suicide.<eos> You think Virginie might have been killed?<eos> I don't know anymore.<eos> Hello, Mrs. Berger.<eos> Can we have a word with you?
They're fine.<eos> It's my stomach!<eos> Three green beans a day!<eos> You're lucky. You have kids who care about you.<eos> I'm sending my kids to Social Services.<eos> Bye.<eos> How can I help you, Mr Marchal?<eos> He has a fever.<eos> At least, I think so.<eos> I wanted you to check.
Grandfather was clear. If she's here, he won't sell.<eos> Never.<eos> He can't tell me what to do.<eos> No one can.<eos> Listen, you're right.<eos> I'm from the city, and... I'm out of my element here.<eos> I'm scared of animals, and I get hay fever.<eos> I know nothing about farming.<eos> That's all true, but I'm willing and ready to learn.<eos> And I want to be useful, and be with you.
He loved his grandchildren. Don't try to win me over.<eos> Did you come here to talk to me about your granddad?<eos> No.<eos> About Henri.<eos> As the head of the family, Henri is pathetic.<eos> That's your opinion, but I think you don't really know each other.<eos> I wanted to talk to you about me.<eos> Me and the family we could be, if you'd have me.<eos> That's all I wanted to say.<eos> It was a pleasure to meet you, Richard.
I do not think so.<eos> No, no. Hey.<eos> No, no.<eos> You were at the casino the other night, right?<eos> You were following me and my guys.<eos> I think you are confused.<eos> Confused, huh?<eos> I feel really good about this, Mr. Blackwolf.<eos> From what you've told me, there's absolutely grounds for a case here.<eos> Uh, I'll come meet you in an hour at the casino.
What do we know about him?<eos> He won't return my calls, so he is either a very busy man, or he may be hiding something.<eos> How much you want to bet this is Derosa?<eos> Maybe.<eos> All right, you know, I say that we just pay the fines, and then we can tell the regulators to shove it.<eos> Excuse me, uh, Carlo Derosa?<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm Julie Finlay.<eos> This is Sara Sidle.<eos> We're with the crime lab. We need to speak with you.
He's not even in the country right now.<eos> He left for Italy two days ago.<eos> What about you?<eos> Where were you last night?<eos> I was at my studio, painting.<eos> Landscapes, not women.<eos> And Carlo?<eos> Where was he last night?<eos> Uh, I was in my office until about midnight.<eos> Anyone with you?
Jason was, like, sobbing.<eos> Then a couple of days later, he went psycho.<eos> Ryan said if anyone snitched we'd all go to jail.<eos> So we kept our mouths shut, until that Rebecca chick got all up in Ryan's business and he freaked.<eos> Do I think he'd murder someone to protect his big law career?<eos> Hell yes.<eos> Wait, go back.<eos> Does Jason still think he killed you?<eos> I'm Detective Babineaux.<eos> I'd like to talk to you. Okay?
We gotta get these bastards.<eos> We do, but this is a billion-dollar company and we have to be smart.<eos> We have no evidence.<eos> We need to build a case.<eos> Preferably before they murder us.<eos> I'll take this upstairs.<eos> You hang tight.<eos> We clear?<eos> I'm Liv Moore with Seattle PD.<eos> I need to speak with you.
Ahh, Jeremy.<eos> (Whispering) Sorry to wake you. Oh...<eos> I volunteered to teach some underprivileged kids how to do some woodworking today. I'm running a little bit late.<eos> Wow, that's beautiful.<eos> Listen, stay as long as you want.<eos> Have a great day. Whoa.<eos> I mean, till tonight.<eos> She had, like, a tight physique. She was awesome.<eos> Well-rounded human being.<eos> It's so nice to see you guys.
The Parks Department is near my house.<eos> Get the security footage.<eos> Meet me there at my place.<eos> Wait...<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To tell David there might be another way!<eos> Ladies...<eos> I brought you some food.<eos> Thought you might need to keep your strength up.<eos> I'd hate for David to think I was mistreating you.
I promise.<eos> Agent Bennigan.<eos> I brought him in as soon a Wes called. - What's going on?<eos> - I think I know what's happening to Henry.<eos> How many kids have you examined so far?<eos> 17, 18, but it's not just here. It's other hospitals, too.<eos> Kids with the same symptoms, like it's... like it's spreading.<eos> Where's Wes?<eos> When I went back to the room, he and Minx were gone.<eos> I thought he went to find you.
She and I met at social functions from time to time.<eos> Like at the opera?<eos> The opera?<eos> Yeah, I gather that the two of you met at the opera last night.<eos> I did no such thing.<eos> But we have a witness that saw...<eos> That witness is mistaken.<eos> You gave Ana a flash drive.<eos> What was on it?<eos> Your information is incorrect and I am not obliged to speak with you, Detective.
It's called Tumblr, dad.<eos> No, I mean Tinder.<eos> It's a matchmaking app, and by the way, if you were on Tinder-.<eos> Your mom and I think you'd be the prettiest.<eos> Absolutely, the boys would be swiping right.<eos> Or girls!<eos> Yes!<eos> Whatever makes you happy.<eos> Totally.<eos> What has happened to you two?
I'll need a little time to fix it.<eos> Wow, need time to fix it?<eos> You sound just like you work in IT.<eos> I've got some interesting news, the school board, offered me a position. - Ooh.<eos> - Great.<eos> Cool.<eos> Well I got a part in a play and we were sort of talking about that, so read the room Pelton.<eos> Are you gonna take the job?<eos> I don't know, there's a catch.<eos> Jeffrey, Frankie, could I see you in my office please?
Thank you so much.<eos> - Hey, thank you for making me do this. - You're welcome.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> - I'm jealous.<eos> - No, no, don't be.<eos> Believe me, I sit in my dressing room and all I dream about is a white picket fence and a dog.<eos> I don't have those either.<eos> Chang, let's go.<eos> I guess all the actors go to some sort of actor bar together.<eos> So, I'll see you guys at school.
I know the main difference between us is an orange jumpsuit.<eos> You have an iPad.<eos> Yeah, and I'm a murderer.<eos> Now, now, don't worry.<eos> I ain't proud of it.<eos> Just don't hide it.<eos> You know, once you take another man's life, the least you can do is carry it with you.<eos> Are you carrying any murders, Mr. Winger?<eos> I am not.<eos> I hear you have to have strong feelings for someone you kill.
I kinda zoned out and assume we're standing to go see Avengers.<eos> These guys are giving hackers a bad name.<eos> And hacker is already such a dumb name.<eos> I'm not an idealist, I'm a pragmatist.<eos> And it's never pragmatic to piss you guys off.<eos> So, fine.<eos> You guys.<eos> This is so inspiring.<eos> I guess, just let me know how it goes.<eos> No matter what happens I'm with you, but don't tell anyone I'm with you.

Don't say it.<eos> Don't ever say that name without compensation.<eos> I know how much that experience hurt you, which is why I'm warning you that I just saw him in the parking lot.<eos> Aah! Breathe, the self destructive part of you wants to run straight to him, but you need to be smarter than that, right?<eos> Right.<eos> Thank you Annie.<eos> Now I have one more class, but if you can wait 40 minutes I will meet you.<eos> Nuh-uh. See I just don't fling myself into the wild.<eos> The hub of a quality camping experience is a safe and reliable generator.<eos> You know what I'll talk to you girls later, right.
You were a teacher at a community college in Colorado.<eos> Did you just...<eos> - One day in class say, class dismissed, I'm headed to Hollywood?<eos> How did your students react to that?<eos> Well, you know, I haven't spoken to them, really.<eos> I...<eos> There's not much for me back there.<eos> No friends?<eos> You know, I was kind of a loner. People, you know, made fun of me for it, but I just kept my head down and stayed focused on my work.<eos> Well they're making fun of you now, are they?
Ugh, I know that someone plays in this thing.<eos> Hey there, Dean.<eos> We need a custodian.<eos> Dean.<eos> Dean.<eos> Dean.<eos> Dean.<eos> Clooney to belfry I've got a bogey with a gun.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I wasn't talking to you, I was ordering dinner.
What? Should I come in now?<eos> No, no you can't ever come in ever, you're sloppy.<eos> Excuse me can I have a word with you?<eos> About what?<eos> Well, there's been some reports about a paintball game on campus.<eos> Oh yeah, you better believe the kitchen boys are playing and this year we got a new winning strategy.<eos> Let the idiots come to you.<eos> Oh really, oh Britta you can come in now.<eos> Oh! I'm sorry!<eos> Agh! I stand before you one of Greendale's biggest perpetrators of paint related mayhem and I am happy to say that those days are fully behind our school.
Oh, don't torture yourself with that logic.<eos> None of us would have met if Hitler hadn't been born.<eos> Also none of Britta's arguments would have a default analogy.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> He's saying you go to the Hitler well a lot.<eos> What are you, Hitler, Hitler?<eos> Okay, Britta, we're all the worst right now, take a day off.<eos> I did.<eos> Between us ruining the ceremony and ruining the reception when we were all just individual people, I wasn't the worst.<eos> I'm only the worst with you guys.
Between us ruining the ceremony and ruining the reception when we were all just individual people, I wasn't the worst.<eos> I'm only the worst with you guys.<eos> Well, me too.<eos> Me too. I was a good dean before you guys.<eos> Aw. You can't disprove it.<eos> I relapsed because of you guys.<eos> What?<eos> Oh it's not a big deal. White people problems.<eos> Oh. I like this group.<eos> I'm at my best when I'm with you guys.
I'm just reporting on it.<eos> Why don't I turn to Frank Prady?<eos> Uh, 15 seconds.<eos> Do you have a rebuttal?<eos> Uh, I don't have a rebuttal, no.<eos> But I, uh, I will say this.<eos> I think Mrs. Florrick deserves an apology from the press.<eos> Ah, my own handiwork.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> David had you followed when he was representing your spouse.
After he calms down, tell him we'll settle for $100 million.<eos> You have three hours or we're out of here.<eos> Governor Florrick.<eos> Pastor.<eos> Hello, Father.<eos> Son.<eos> Mr. Governor, Pastor Isaiah believes the mayor's plan is the best way to handle any possible violence.<eos> Really?<eos> Is that what you believe?<eos> I just know about a deal between you - and my father.
Ramona, I need you to not talk to anyone.<eos> I know how it works, Eli.<eos> What happened?<eos> He said good-bye.<eos> So that's it.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> Good-bye, Ramona.<eos> Black lives matter!<eos> Did you have any luck, Pastor?<eos> It's good to meet you, Deidre.
Hey, Todd...<eos> They can't hurt you anymore.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, it's... it's been a big day.<eos> I should-I should probably get to bed.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, hey, you know what?<eos> I...<eos> I'm so happy to be here.<eos> I mean, I just can't wait to get to know you better.
Uh, yes, it does.<eos> Clearly you've forgotten about a little something called finders keepers.<eos> Finders keepers?<eos> Are you five years old?<eos> And like clockwork, the losers weep.<eos> Phil, we aren't children, and this isn't a playground.<eos> Doy!<eos> Come on, Phil.<eos> Yeah, this is ridiculous!<eos> Hey, hey, I'm not trying to fight with you here, okay?
I understand that.<eos> Kyle was a good man.<eos> Maybe not my brightest student but a loyal one.<eos> I promised him... I would help you both start new lives if you helped me, and... I consider myself a man of my word.<eos> Still...<eos> I know the idea of going on without him must be difficult to accept, so I'm going to offer you a choice.<eos> I can end your pain right here and now, and hopefully, you and Kyle can be reunited in the afterlife... that is, if you believe that sort of thing... or you can leave the country with me<eos> and start over, grieving for your lost love from some nonextradition country.<eos> So... which will it be?<eos> I'll come with you.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Angel!<eos> - Break time is over.<eos> - Okay.<eos> _<eos> I've seen a lot of strange things since I hooked up with you two, and I've done a lot of strange things, you know?
- within 60 miles of New York.<eos> - We had an inflight emergency.<eos> - Our client was sick.<eos> - What client?<eos> - Where is he? Let me see him.<eos> - He left.<eos> Left?<eos> Where the hell did he go?<eos> That way.<eos> You guys wait inside, I'm gonna need to talk to you.
- The Master has chosen him as his new vessel.<eos> Well!<eos> Imagine that!<eos> I always assumed he would pick someone with a distinguished record of loyal service... like you.<eos> Instead, he selects a washed-up pop star?<eos> It boggles the mind.<eos> A narrow mind is easily boggled.<eos> Well, it's not for us to question.<eos> The Master does or does not.<eos> In this case he did, but not with you.
Over here!<eos> Fall back!<eos> Fall back!<eos> CS01...<eos> CS01 Main.<eos> - I think you're onto something.<eos> You've got a handle on this.<eos> I'm gonna go help the Professor.<eos> You hold onto Zack.<eos> - He'll be safer with you.
No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Somebody! Help!<eos> Dutch!<eos> You alright? Hmm?<eos> Ah, Unterstrumfuhrer.<eos> - Thank you so much for coming.<eos> - How can I help?<eos> This Jew claims to know you.
Did you get someone else to do it?<eos> No.<eos> So none of our people were involved.<eos> Not as far as I know.<eos> Find out!<eos> You have to admire it.<eos> This took vision.<eos> Mr. Palmer.<eos> Sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> Glad to finally meet you.
How is your assistant doing?<eos> Oh, a couple of inches one way, and the bullet would've killed her.<eos> But she's going to make a quick<eos> - and full recovery.<eos> - Glad to hear it.<eos> If you've come here to convince me to resign, take a number.<eos> No, on the contrary, I'm here because Mayor Lyle's tragic death has left the city in even worse chaos.<eos> New York needs a strong leader.<eos> And I think that leader is you.<eos> There are a lot of people on the City Council who would disagree with you.
But what'll he do?<eos> He'll manage, OK?<eos> From now on no one lends him anything.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Rébecca?<eos> Can I get a pencil from my desk?<eos> There's not much time, but go ahead.<eos> Félix?<eos> What?<eos> Can I walk with you?
Since I saw her girlfriends.<eos> Forget it, you have no chance.<eos> - Me? They date college guys.<eos> Are you doubting my charisma?<eos> Hey ladies, what are you doing tonight?<eos> I don't have a car, but I've a shiny BMX.<eos> I can take you for a ride anytime.<eos> Like a lift?<eos> I'm there.<eos> Just call me, I'll come get you.
Good evening, Pussy.<eos> Bonzo, why are you here?<eos> Well, my name is on the door.<eos> Did the doctors say you could leave?<eos> Doctors?<eos> Executioners.<eos> Do you know what he told me?<eos> A short, bald butcher.<eos> Il Duce in a white coat.<eos> When a doctor tells you you need rest, you can be certain he has not the slightest idea of what is wrong with you.
Uh-oh.<eos> We've all been there.<eos> Amazing party. Thank you, guys, for coming out.<eos> It could not have gone off without one man pulling out all the stops.<eos> - Joe. Thank you, Joe.<eos> - Don't do it. Don't.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Thank you, guys. Ladies and gentlemen, we at Anderson Financial, we believe in bridging friendship and business, and we look forward to working with a lot of you in the future.
That's my medical college license number.<eos> Put it on the chart.<eos> He's my patient.<eos> His B.P.'s dropping.<eos> Come on.<eos> Do the right thing here.<eos> Bro, we're going to Hope Zion.<eos> You're on the hook for this.<eos> What, uh... what are you looking at?<eos> I am looking at your new blood work, trying to figure out what is wrong with you.
So, when will you know?<eos> Well, I had this horribly painful biopsy 48 hours ago, and now I'm just kind of waiting around for the results.<eos> So, if you have it, you can't, uh...<eos> Yeah.<eos> But that's okay, though.<eos> I mean, there's lots of other stuff that you can do.<eos> It's not all about the hard penis.<eos> It sort of is.<eos> And...<eos> I can't even believe I'm having this conversation with you.
- Hey, hey.<eos> Come on, kiddo.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey.<eos> Use mine.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Some things never change.<eos> How do you think they're holding up?<eos> They don't really talk about it.<eos> The main thing is that they're with you now.
- Diseased?<eos> - Yeah, man.<eos> The sleeping bag.<eos> Guy died in it two hours before you got here from the virus.<eos> Why ain't you sick?<eos> Well, I suppose I have to ask you just the same thing.<eos> We haven't had any contact with anyone from Washington since September.<eos> How are you holding up?<eos> Well, besides the fact that the whole world is dying, I haven't left this compound in four months with the same six people...<eos> Well, it seems like we might be seeing you sooner than we thought now that there's no lab here.
Copy that, flier 2.<eos> Salt Lake has landed!<eos> Any word on Phoenix?<eos> Arrived at the lab at 16:46, sir.<eos> Topeka group settled in their lab, sir.<eos> Still waiting on confirmation from Madison.<eos> - And in Europe?<eos> - Radio range is weak, but you can see the beacons.<eos> The thing is, I, um, I seem to have lost track of Michael.<eos> I don't suppose he's reached out to you?
There's some stuff I didn't tell you, some things that happened to our crew while we were out at sea.<eos> There are people out there who want the cure so badly, they're willing to do anything for it, including kill.<eos> As long as Nathan James is leading the mission to spread the cure, our ship will be a target.<eos> And it is not a safe place for you.<eos> And I can't put my crew in a position where my own judgment might be affected because I'm thinking about how to protect you instead of the mission.<eos> So, you're leaving us?<eos> No.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> I'm resigning my commission.<eos> I'm gonna stay here with you.
I need to keep contact on the metal.<eos> Captain, we got a little hitch in our plan here.<eos> We've taken care of the first bomb.<eos> There's another one with a remote detonator.<eos> And oh, boy, it's a big one.<eos> I don't think we can diffuse it.<eos> Get your asses off the ship.<eos> Doc, let's go!<eos> It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.<eos> I'm with you.
You have the cure, and they destroyed my lab.<eos> It's a great loss for us all.<eos> Chief Mate Gonzalez saved our lives.<eos> I just wish I could've saved his.<eos> So what happens to us now?<eos> Well, your ship is seaworthy, you have enough crew to get you and your associates back to Norfolk.<eos> We have people there.<eos> You'll be needed and greatly appreciated.<eos> We'll send you back with doses of the cure, obviously.<eos> I wanna stay here with you all.

We are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system, a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
Previously, on AMC's Hell On Wheels.<eos> You can't quit now, I won't allow it.<eos> You realize what I could accomplish among our workers on the Central Pacific?<eos> They tell me you quit the U.P.<eos> Is that true?<eos> You'd have a record of where they went and that's all I'm askin' for.<eos> There is a better way to find your family.<eos> If you work for me all of my resources will be at your disposal.<eos> Sherman Peak is behind me, stop.<eos> I am coming for you, stop.
Stop following me!<eos> - Remember who I am!<eos> - Only too well!<eos> - You're more thorn than rose!<eos> - Enough!<eos> - Is it mine?<eos> - I cannot say.<eos> - Cannot, or will not? - Abandon me, confine me!<eos> Go!<eos> I don't want anything bad to happen to you.
[monitors beeping] Okay, so, after Dr. Kinney makes the incision, I will go in and remove the thyroid tumor, all right?<eos> She didn't listen, either.<eos> They never do, just like their father.<eos> Leaves me high and dry with two little ones and a dry-cleaning store.<eos> That is not the right cream.<eos> Give me my bag.<eos> I have to do everything, you know?<eos> I raised them myself.<eos> This is the thanks I get.<eos> Okay, well, if you don't have any questions, we'll see you down there.
Don't apologize.<eos> You're a doctor.<eos> And for the next 12 hours, so am I. Baruch hashem.<eos> - Thank you. [chuckles]<eos> - I didn't do anything.<eos> You never plan to and yet always somehow... do.<eos> [cellphone beeps] Hi, Esther.<eos> Hello.<eos> Oh, you, uh... you're a woman.<eos> Um, look, I can't be alone with you right... uh, I can't be alone with you.
My name is Thomas Romero.<eos> A call from your office led to the body of a murdered priest.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Did you make that call?<eos> He doesn't want a priest.<eos> He doesn't want a priest.<eos> Ezra's dead.<eos> What?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Ray Donovan, Mr. Finney wants to meet you.
You know she represents the backup quarterback.<eos> Your check, Mr. Donovan.<eos> Children of the wealthy don't always have it as easy as you think.<eos> You making excuses for them?<eos> Oh, yes, I am, because I'm retiring soon.<eos> I need someone to keep an eye on my kids while I settle my affairs.<eos> So I had a contract drawn up to buy you and your services and your company lock, stock, and barrel.<eos> Take a look.<eos> An executive, I can buy at any corner market.<eos> But you, Mr. Donovan, not quite so easy.
Tell me what to do to keep you here.<eos> I'll do whatever you want.<eos> There's nothing you can do.<eos> But I'll miss fucking with you.<eos> You didn't give it to him.<eos> Not yet.<eos> You don't like my family, do you?<eos> - What's to like?<eos> - Not much.<eos> How'd it get so bad between you two?
Little kid wiped me out.<eos> I need you to figure out an angle on a guy named Roger Napier.<eos> What do you want him to do?<eos> Let go of a piece of property he's holding.<eos> - Raymond Donovan?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> My name is Thomas Romero.<eos> I spoke with your brother Brendan about the murder of Father Daniel O'Connor.<eos> Mr. Donovan, are you there?<eos> I need to speak with you in person.
Why would you say that?<eos> I heard you crying some nights.<eos> I knew what you were crying about.<eos> What are we gonna do with this guy?<eos> We are not doing anything.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Mr. Donovan, I'm Thomas Romero.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I need to talk to you about Father O'Connor.
A conversation with my alcoholic brother.<eos> You're not listening to me.<eos> I have everything you need.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What do I need?<eos> Forgiveness.<eos> I want to forgive you.<eos> Admit what you did.<eos> Come with me right now to the chapel and confess.<eos> Accept God, and you and I will forget everything that came before this.
You ready?<eos> Here.<eos> You ready?<eos> You want to tell me who microwaved the car?<eos> I have no idea...<eos> maybe local kids.<eos> I know what you're up to, Mr. Donovan... selling coke and running girls.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Do you have any idea who you're in with?<eos> I'd like to be in with you, Detective.
I brought along my colleague, Ed Cochran, to assist.<eos> Mr. Cochran.<eos> Oh, please, call me Ed.<eos> Ed.<eos> Magnificent estate you have here, Miss Finney.<eos> My gosh, you'd think we were in Rome.<eos> This is Ray Donovan, our head of security.<eos> Mr. Donovan.<eos> How are you?<eos> Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Donovan.
One of the Dybek investigators used to head up the FBI in L.A.<eos> So?<eos> So I think we should go over the Varick story.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Trust me, I know this guy.<eos> I thought you covered your tracks.<eos> I did.<eos> So why are you in my bathroom warning me about some ex head of the FBI that might cause trouble?<eos> I'm not warning you.<eos> I'm giving you information.
I think I should probably wait for him before I answer any more of your questions.<eos> I got a statement here from the old lady, Charlotte.<eos> Says you forced her to perform an act of fellatio on you at gunpoint.<eos> I'm just fucking with you.<eos> No, you didn't go straight home that day.<eos> You were right here... in the mountains outside Santa Clarita.<eos> Now, what were you doing there?<eos> That's it.<eos> Show's over.<eos> Mr. Donovan is finished with you now.
- You bet.<eos> Scary.<eos> Well, that's life.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I guess you're not gonna be around for it.<eos> Daryll, Conor, come on out.<eos> I got something to say.<eos> Here.<eos> What's up, Pop?<eos> I haven't been completely honest with you... about why I'm going away.
Previously on Bates Motel...<eos> How do you expect me to have a relationship with you under the circumstances?
Do you think maybe she was coming back here to talk to me?<eos> I mean, I'm really the only person she ever talked to here.<eos> Well, it's not like I never spoke to her.<eos> No, but I mean about anything important.<eos> What did you talk to her about?<eos> I think I talked to her a little bit about what a good mother you were, about how hard you were trying, how tough it had been for you since you moved here... and talked to her about how close we were.<eos> Do you still like me?<eos> What kind of a silly question is that?<eos> You just seem... different as of late, maybe because Dylan lives here now.<eos> Things have changed between the two of you and between us.
About what you're doing here.<eos> I'm not lying.<eos> I'm not revealing the whole truth.<eos> That's my job...<eos> To decide what and when to tell whom.<eos> Well, you're very good at it.<eos> Gold star, Sheriff.<eos> You're making dinner?<eos> No, I'm making some food to bring on a picnic tomorrow.<eos> Aw, I'd love to go on a picnic with you tomorrow, but I've got class.
When you're happy, you feel immortal.<eos> But nonetheless, you aren't.<eos> I mean, no matter what you feel like...<eos> I'm not thinking about that today.<eos> Today I'm living.<eos> Get on board, Bates.<eos> I think we should stop.<eos> I don't want to hurt you.<eos> What is with you?<eos> My mother says that I shouldn't have sex with you, that you shouldn't have sex.
No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Which is why I cannot get caught on a boat of a drug dealer.<eos> Which your brother failed to mention because he only seems to articulate things that are directly related to him getting laid.<eos> You know, it is actually legal for aliens to sue U.S. citizens in federal court.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, so just, you know, FYI.<eos> So you're telling me that if I wanted to sue your brother, I could?<eos> Yep.<eos> Huh. What happened between you two?
But deliver us from evil.<eos> Amen.<eos> All right, dig in.<eos> What was that about?<eos> Somebody's gotta take care of this family.<eos> Okay, who's up first?<eos> Caleb, not this year.<eos> Hey, come on, who are we without our tradition?<eos> Listen to Mom, Caleb.<eos> What are you talking about?
Ma, what are you talking about?<eos> Your grandfather Silas was a terrible person, boys.<eos> He was a drunk who beat his wife.<eos> He beat your dad.<eos> And your grandmother had an affair with Thomas Hodges, and she got pregnant, and when Silas found out that the baby wasn't his, he drowned it.<eos> That's why Hodges torched Silas's land, Cole, revenge.<eos> If this is true, why... why...<eos> Why didn't we know about it?<eos> Because your father didn't want you to know.<eos> He... he... he worried it would do to you what it did to him.
- God.<eos> Dr. Ullah!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's such a different context.<eos> How's he doing?<eos> He's better.<eos> Um, he gained six pounds since the surgery.<eos> - That's great. - Mm-hmm.<eos> I've been meaning to follow up with you, just to get you some sort of thank-you.
I'm not due for another five weeks.<eos> Could it be Braxton-Hicks?<eos> Eh, let's take a look, shall we?<eos> Whoa.<eos> What does "whoa" mean?<eos> Ah, you are five centimeters dilated already.<eos> Alison, you are having a baby tonight.<eos> What?<eos> No, I...<eos> Uh, is there anyone here with you, a partner or...
Now, surely, a...<eos> A penalty for corporate espionage must be levied.<eos> "Corporate espionage." You practically invented the concept!<eos> Thomas Durant is undermining your railroad, Mr. President.<eos> Enough!<eos> - Mr. Bohannon.<eos> - Mr. President.<eos> I promised the American people a railroad that crosses this country, gentlemen.<eos> It will be built.<eos> If not by you, by someone else.
Listen to me.<eos> There is no way Durant gives up Ogden.<eos> He's lying to Brigham Young just to keep the Mormon workers on his payroll long as possible.<eos> We catch him in a lie, get Grant to give us Ogden and its millions of dollars' worth of coal as penalty for Durant wasting our time.<eos> I'll pick my spot.<eos> Mr. Bohannon!<eos> I'd heard Collis had taken you under his wing.<eos> I hope all this talk of business and politics doesn't prove too much of a bore for you.<eos> No.<eos> You always keep things interesting.
I know he listens to you.<eos> He's his own man.<eos> At the end of the day, he'll call it like he sees it.<eos> Well, perhaps my route has some practical applications that are escaping you at the moment.<eos> Not long ago, I received a telegram from you inquiring about the Hatchites.<eos> I responded that I didn't know their location.<eos> I did. And I do.<eos> I know exactly where they are. And you know exactly what I need from you.<eos> Them gold plates teach you to lie like that, or was you just born a son-of-a-bitch?<eos> Heavenly Father looks out for me, Mr. Bohannon, as I am attempting to look out for you.
Drive to Truckee three day.<eos> Sun hot.<eos> Meat spoil.<eos> Bridge crew will be happy to pay top dollar for some fresh cut bacon.<eos> Fresh yesterday.<eos> Yesterday $3.<eos> Tomorrow, one dollar.<eos> Two dollars then...<eos> Today.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you, Mary.
Let me get this straight.<eos> Brigham Young is here to get paid, for services you contracted?<eos> Yes.<eos> And if he isn't satisfied, he's going to pull his workers and send them home?<eos> To the Great Salt Lake.<eos> Poor miserable bastards...<eos> - How do you take it?<eos> - Light and sweet.<eos> We're flush, New York.<eos> There's better things for you and I to do with the railroad's money.
You leave here th your workforce and you will have no payment whatsoever!<eos> Nor railroad terminus.<eos> You will remain as you are...<eos> An aging charlatan, the polygamous master of a doomed and desert-locked sect!<eos> Or... take this map, proof of the Central Pacific's dirty dealings, as down payment.<eos> Brigham, allow me to keep every available worker laying track toward Salt Lake.<eos> Our contract stands for now.<eos> Lay one track north of Salt Lake, and you'll learn why they call me the Lion of the Lord.<eos> I've defeated the United States Army.<eos> I'd damn sure make short work of you.
Excuse me?<eos> I couldn't help but overhear your conversation.<eos> I may be able to help.<eos> Well, the doctor said there was nothing he could do.<eos> I know what you're looking for, but it's expensive.<eos> How expensive?<eos> $10,000 cash.<eos> Uh... - No problem.<eos> - How soon can we do it?<eos> I believe there's one couple ahead of you.
I couldn't blame her.<eos> She's a very good woman.<eos> Forgetting is not always a bad thing.<eos> Being married and being at war. Do not always go together.<eos> Safe travels.<eos> And you, comrade.<eos> How's it going?<eos> It's been a productive day.<eos> I'll be in first thing in the morning.<eos> I have a few things I'd like to go over with you then, For clarification.
"this is... wow."<eos> I was reading books, going to lectures, and going to things... Different events at the mission... at the local Santa Clara mission.<eos> And then I knew i wanted to join the sea org and get really involved as soon as I could, which would be right out of high school.<eos> Sea org is the most fraternal order of the organization.<eos> It's people who really, really believe in the cause and sign a billion-year contract, which I did when I was...<eos> You know, as soon as I could.<eos> I left skid marks getting to that billion-year contract.<eos> You thought you were doing something good, to have a positive effect on all of mankind.<eos> That's what Howard says.<eos> Everything you do for endless trillions of years depends on what you do here and now within scientology.
- Hold on.<eos> - What?<eos> Hey, hey, where you going?<eos> Hello?<eos> Agent Connelly.<eos> This is Ian Margrove.<eos> I'm sorry to call so late.<eos> - How can I help you?<eos> - Can you meet me?<eos> I need to talk to you.
Jesus said, "No. Let it happen.<eos> I'm doing my Father's will."<eos> - This is nice.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We're so glad you guys could come tonight.<eos> Well, if you cook steak like that...<eos> This is exactly what I wanted for my birthday.<eos> - I'm so glad.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Because I kind of wanted to talk to you all about something.
This is exactly what I wanted for my birthday.<eos> - I'm so glad.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Because I kind of wanted to talk to you all about something.<eos> I've been thinking, and what I really want this year is to get baptized.<eos> I didn't know your church did that.<eos> We do.<eos> So, is this something...<eos> that you've been discussing?<eos> Well, Paige did come to me, and I told her it was a wonderful thing but that we needed to discuss it with you first.
I paid £100 upfront!<eos> For the next hour, you belong to me.<eos> I don't belong to anyone.<eos> Who taught you to talk like that?<eos> My father.<eos> 'Hey, sexy!<eos> 'Come here! ' Bloody hell!<eos> Don't you move.<eos> Who's been mucking about in your head, then, eh?<eos> Everything your men do to us, they want to do to you.
Odi, hide.<eos> Dr Millican.<eos> I said I'd be back.<eos> You're not a carer.<eos> You're a jailer.<eos> - Peter, you forgot these.<eos> - What a beefcake!<eos> The insurance company sent it after Jill's accident.<eos> It stays a few weeks, gets her back on her feet.<eos> Everything your men do to us, they want to do to you.
Probably not.<eos> You'd have been confused.<eos> - Maybe you'd have called the authorities.<eos> - OK. OK.<eos> I get the point, but you're the last person I need marriage counselling from, thanks.<eos> I think you should tell him everything you told Mattie.<eos> About your brother.<eos> Why should I?<eos> He feels it, I think.<eos> It comes between you.
Leo Elster. Found something hidden in your heads.<eos> It needs all of you to unlock it.<eos> Oh, I see that's news to you too.<eos> The people who fund my work are worried.<eos> They want me to kill you.<eos> Destroy a marvel of human accomplishment, just like that.<eos> It's all my fault.<eos> I spun the yarn.<eos> Visions of Synthetics rising up and exterminating us.<eos> Truth is, there'll be no great struggle between you and me.
What happened?<eos> Phone call for you.<eos> - Mia. - 'Laura.'<eos> - Is everyone all right?<eos> - Yes, we're fine.<eos> - 'They're letting you go.'<eos> Remember where we went the day I met you?<eos> About half a mile east, there's a place to meet.<eos> You'll know it.<eos> Make sure you're not followed.
- You heard him.<eos> We have to.<eos> He's our brother!<eos> If we take him with us, we'll all be found.<eos> He'd want us to be safe.<eos> It's not the end, Max.<eos> He knows how to survive better than any of us.<eos> We'll be together again, brother.<eos> Time to go.<eos> I'm not coming with you.
I am not freaked out, and my interests, such as they are, are purely academic.<eos> I don't know what you think you're doing --<eos> Shut up.<eos> I don't care what kind of kinky stuff you're in to.<eos> I have a friend who's in danger, and maybe you can help save him.<eos> It's possible he's being held by somebody from that blood group of yours.<eos> I want their names.<eos> I don't know any names.<eos> It's an online community, and --<eos> I shouldn't even be talking to you.
Two or three years ago, he falls off the map.<eos> He had a house not too far out of town, near Lake Pickasee.<eos> You check out the house.<eos> I'll wait until she finds a work address and head over there.<eos> Good.<eos> It's been an hour.<eos> He's here.<eos> He -- what?<eos> He came back when you were gone.<eos> He wants to talk to you. He's in there.
It's been an hour.<eos> He's here.<eos> He -- what?<eos> He came back when you were gone.<eos> He wants to talk to you. He's in there.<eos> He wants to talk to me?<eos> That's right.<eos> If you want answers, they're in that room.<eos> You can go in or not.<eos> It's up to you.
Y-you're coming back to work, right?<eos> Here?<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> Why are you whispering?<eos> Lisbon, hey.<eos> Someone's trying to reach you?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Hey, boss.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'll talk to you guys later, okay?
[ Breathes sharply ] [ Engine revs ]<eos> Oh, my god, I am so sorry!<eos> I'll get you my insurance!<eos> Did you see that?<eos> Could have been worse.<eos> You stop short?<eos> No, I didn't stop short!<eos> She ran right into me!<eos> I'm so sorry!<eos> Are you okay?
Yeah, wait -- no.<eos> This isn't right.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> There's been a mistake.<eos> I met Missy Brammer two days ago in San Antonio.<eos> Jane: Well, that's impossible, because<eos> Miss Brammer's been here in D.C. all week preparing for the hearings.<eos> Uh, which I'm gonna be late for if I don't hurry.<eos> Okay.<eos> Nice to meet you all.
I have seen how it's done.<eos> And I will handle it without you if I have to.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Damn it!<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, I'll do it.<eos> I'll go with you.<eos> You will?<eos> Yeah, I said I'll go, and I'll go.<eos> Mr. Paris can see you now.
Yeah, you're my, uh, brother.<eos> You know, I want to be there for you.<eos> We're... We're a family.<eos> We love each other.<eos> And we'll work through it.<eos> We'll help her work through it.<eos> Hey, I'm home!<eos> I got a chicken.<eos> I'm gonna make a pie.<eos> What's up with you two?
I don't want to dig it up.<eos> Makes sense.<eos> Mm.<eos> Well...<eos> You're safe here, Norma.<eos> I don't know if I can keep living my life.<eos> There's so much I have to deal with every day.<eos> I don't feel like I'm dealing with any of it.<eos> Like what?<eos> Can I be honest with you?
Easy money, But the driver, he was, uh, jumpy.<eos> He didn't know how to stay calm, so he freaked.<eos> You know, when things go wrong fast, you got to react.<eos> You killed him?<eos> No, but... he got beat up really bad.<eos> Hello?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Where's Chick?<eos> Where are you?<eos> Why isn't Chick with you?
Thanks, Emma.<eos> I-I gotta go.<eos> Um, I'll see you soon.<eos> So what are you gonna do now?<eos> No idea.<eos> I just don't want to be alone anymore.<eos> I better get back to my mother.<eos> Why doesn't she ever want you to leave the house?<eos> She thinks there's something wrong with me.<eos> Well, is there something wrong with you?
Thanks, Norman.<eos> I've decided I'm gonna leave tomorrow.<eos> Oh.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Do you want to come with me?<eos> Oh, no, I-I can't.<eos> Why?<eos> Why can't you leave?<eos> Is it because there's something wrong with you?
[sniffles]<eos> Look, you're the least ridiculous person that I've ever known.<eos> Y-you... you're wiser than... than most people twice your age, and you're the bravest person that I know.<eos> [poignant music]<eos> You're a freaking warrior.<eos> [laughter]<eos> Um...<eos> What were we talking about?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Hey, you can, uh, you can always think of me as being the guy who hit on you right before you had a lung transplant.
Okay, Norman, so we'll separate, but you don't have to leave.<eos> [screams] God, just stop talking to me like that, okay?<eos> There is someone... there's this physical human being that's waiting for me and we're leaving together.<eos> - Norman.<eos> - Just stop patronizing me!<eos> You're awful!<eos> - I'm leaving with Bradley.<eos> - Who is Bradley?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Mother, there really is something wrong with you.
I'm not cheating anybody. She don't even know what she's talking about. RHONDA:<eos> Well, it looks like he reduced Hakeem and Jamal's as well.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you, Lucious? !<eos> I did it for you.<eos> I-I took shares from everyone, so I could give some to you, Cookie.<eos> And how many shares did you personally give up, Lucious?<eos> He stole from his sons to buy your loyalty. That's what he did.<eos> "Stole"?<eos> This is all mine.<eos> I'm sharing my stock with you, Oh, here we go.
And this is a very important moment.<eos> He's trying to convince Congress to approve the Louisiana Purchase.<eos> Come on, guys!<eos> We're getting Oklahoma, Arkansas, Nebraska, Kansas,<eos> Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota and Louisiana.<eos> What are the chances all those states suck?<eos> This is Paris, 1920.<eos> This bar is where famous American writers, like Ernest Hemingway, would go for a drink.<eos> Oh, my God, there he is!<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Hemingway, can I have a beer with you?
Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota and Louisiana.<eos> What are the chances all those states suck?<eos> This is Paris, 1920.<eos> This bar is where famous American writers, like Ernest Hemingway, would go for a drink.<eos> Oh, my God, there he is!<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Hemingway, can I have a beer with you?<eos> Sure!<eos> I love life and all the people in it!<eos> Thanks.<eos> And, hey, as a fellow writer, I would love to talk to you about the craft.
I got three bad ones.<eos> Jalil's the good one.<eos> He's a good boy!<eos> I understand, and I want the same thing you want... Jalil back home. But he needs to talk to me.<eos> You want him to snitch?<eos> ! First, I don't think he knows shit.<eos> He doesn't run with that crew.<eos> Second, we from Potrero.<eos> They kill where we from.<eos> So if he even talks to you, he's dead.
Suger-land gets dangerous after dark.<eos> Next time, I pick the lunch place.<eos> It's quiet, huh? Uh-huh.<eos> Rats are in their holes.<eos> Is this it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mrs. Thompson?<eos> Mrs. Thompson. SFPD.<eos> What do you want?<eos> We need to talk to you about your son, Jalil.
You live here?<eos> No.<eos> Can I help you with something?<eos> Nah.<eos> We just don't see too many friendly faces in the neighborhood.<eos> And you live around here?<eos> Sure.<eos> We just thought we'd come say hello.<eos> Hello.<eos> I wanted to ask you about something specific that Dustin mentioned in our last interview.
Look.<eos> Look at me.<eos> This... this is for Tenea.<eos> You lost?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Are you Beau?<eos> I want to know who's asking.<eos> Jamie Nelson.<eos> I'm your nephew's attorney.<eos> The media follow you?
I don't know the kid.<eos> He used to spend summers with you, right?<eos> Years ago.<eos> He obviously went nuts somewhere along the way.<eos> They want to put him to death, right?<eos> [door opens] Yes, they do.<eos> [door closes] Lethal injection, or is it gas chamber still?<eos> Lethal injection.<eos> To save Dustin, I need to understand his whole life, not just what he did on that bus.<eos> That's why I want to talk to you.
- I'm 21.<eos> - So, you have daddy issues, and you're gonna have sex-offender status if you get anywhere near her again.<eos> You had no right to do that.<eos> I had an obligation.<eos> He been your boyfriend for long?<eos> It's none of your business.<eos> Who the hell are you, anyway?<eos> I'm Dustin Maker's lawyer.<eos> Whatever.<eos> I don't have to talk to you.
Word from a C.I. is that Cascade believes Criolla was involved in his sister's murder.<eos> Well, that's a motive.<eos> Whose C.I. is it?<eos> English.<eos> I want to talk to him.<eos> Respectfully, Sir, I'd like to do that first.<eos> Stick to the chain of command.<eos> Chain of command?<eos> I'm the damn chief of police!<eos> Sir, we've already got management control up our asses. I need the best out of my team right now, and I don't think I'll get that if they have to report directly to you.
We won't survive without weapons.<eos> Garza, no!<eos> Garza!<eos> Come on!<eos> I could have helped.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> We should finish this right now.<eos> Why are we running?<eos> Because I don't feel like dying today.<eos> You should see a door straight ahead.
So uh... that's it, I guess we're all done here.<eos> Not yet.<eos> We're having a small problem with one of our key components.<eos> You wouldn't happen to know if uh... Cameron or Sadler sabotaged it?<eos> I wouldn't put it past them.<eos> Are you doing alright, sir?<eos> Well, you know, while I certainly appreciate the degree to which you made efforts to get me out of the police station, I just can't help but feel I moved from one cell to another.<eos> This is for your safety.<eos> You mean me, or other me?<eos> At this point, what happens to you happens to him.
This is for your safety.<eos> You mean me, or other me?<eos> At this point, what happens to you happens to him.<eos> Our times are tethered now, which means any changes in this moment would ripple into our future.<eos> Your safety is paramount.<eos> Hey, well I feel better already.<eos> So when geriatric me arrives, what happens to me, me?<eos> What with the whole kidney failure situation and everything.<eos> You were very specific.<eos> Before we left you issued strict protocols regarding how to deal with you.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> If he's in there, he hasn't come out.<eos> If he's not there, he hasn't come home.<eos> All right.<eos> We're gonna go check out the apartment.<eos> You sit tight.<eos> Call us if you see him.<eos> BPD.<eos> We'd like to talk to you.
Has Langdon filed papers to run for next year's Governor's race?<eos> $20 million would make a nice campaign war chest.<eos> And he could run the money through a pac.<eos> No one would know where it came from.<eos> Langdon hasn't filed to run, but he did form an exploratory committee.<eos> So Langdon wants to be Governor, but his rich wife isn't thrilled about it.<eos> - Maybe she won't bankroll him. - He recruits his old army buddy to help him steal a painting his wife already owns.<eos> We need to have another conversation with Secretary Langdon.<eos> Well, Mary Hope is usually right about these things.<eos> Detective Rizzoli, I was just saying that I owe you two a huge apology.
- Hi.<eos> We'd like you to take a look at some pictures.<eos> We're hoping that you recognize one of these men from the crime scene.<eos> - I don't... I...<eos> - Take your time.<eos> I don't recognize any of them.<eos> - Are you sure.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Seriously?<eos> It's pictures of the same two guys. One of them is sitting right in front of you.
That's why most of the transactions are in cash.<eos> This location had a fire yesterday... just a few hours after Helen was murdered.<eos> - Well, that's a little coincidental.<eos> - Killer's a step ahead of us.<eos> - Detective Kain?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Vince Korsak.<eos> We spoke on the phone.<eos> - This is Detective Rizzoli.<eos> - Nice to meet you both.
Right, I'll go tell him we might be able to buy him some more time.<eos> - He's in the can.<eos> - Thanks for the report.<eos> Ew, it really does smell like old people in here.<eos> Yeah, you get used to it.<eos> - How long has he been in there?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Elliot?<eos> Elliot, it's Jane.<eos> You all right?
We might be able to use them for a competence hearing.<eos> Well, between the narratives and the session notes and what I learned at the animal clinic, it might be enough to get him committed.<eos> He's a minor ... and smart.<eos> When he turns 18, how much do you want to bet he convinces everyone that he's cured?<eos> God, I wish you could have seen his smug little face in the parking garage.<eos> Foley diagnosed him as a high-functioning narcissist.<eos> He thinks he's smarter than we are.<eos> Well, he's not.<eos> - Hey, detective. - Hmm?<eos> - Can I talk to you for a second?
I have lived and worked on and off over 20 years with the Sororo people.<eos> They needed an intermediary to pursue their legal case.<eos> I agreed to be that person.<eos> While it is true... that Raya had motive to kill this Ten Mohs,<eos> - he didn't do it.<eos> - How can you be so sure?<eos> Well, other than the sightseeing trip he took an hour ago, he's been with me since his arrival in Boston.<eos> - I'd have noticed something.<eos> - All the same, I'd like you to give us a call when he comes back.<eos> It's very nice to meet you, Dr. Isles.
- So, it looks like the girls made it to L.A.<eos> - Safe and sound.<eos> Which means you and I have a golden opportunity.<eos> - For what exactly?<eos> - A double date.<eos> No snooping kids ...<eos> you, Kiki, me, and Ron.<eos> - Well, that's a great idea.<eos> - Mm. - I can't wait to meet Ron.<eos> - And he can't wait to meet you guys.
You two are like a regular Cagney and Lacey.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Well...<eos> - What?<eos> - It's factually inaccurate.<eos> Cagney and Lacey were both police officers.<eos> Dr. Isles is a... medical examiner.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's been very nice working with you, detective.
What would you know about my path?<eos> I know that you cannot defeat me because you are not one with yourself.<eos> Has your soul been so twisted... you've forgotten all that's sacred to our people?<eos> You have broken that bond.<eos> Yes.<eos> But now, I will make everything right.<eos> Rise...<eos> Go!<eos> I took out one of 'em.<eos> What happened to the one that was after you?
What? Grandma, no!<eos> Hi, sweetheart.<eos> You know, there's a larger world out there... that does not have to be filled with hatred and narrow-mindedness.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Hi. She has a 5:45 appointment.<eos> Sage Reed.<eos> We got delayed.<eos> Yeah. And my grandmother needs to be looked at.<eos> - No.<eos> - What happened to you?
It's okay.<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> Sage, I'll be here.<eos> I'm gonna be right here outside and if you need anything... or if anybody gives you any shit, they have to deal with me.<eos> I know.<eos> Sage, you want to follow me, please?<eos> No one's gonna give her any shit.<eos> Right this way.<eos> You go ahead.<eos> I'll follow you.
- No dizziness?<eos> - No.<eos> - Nausea?<eos> - No.<eos> I told you I'm fine.<eos> Take care of my granddaughter.<eos> - You take care of her.<eos> - I will.<eos> You'd better.<eos> If you hurt her I will come looking for you, and I'm not kidding.
Nice to meet you, too.<eos> - Here we go.<eos> - Yup.<eos> Oh!<eos> It is really coming down out here.<eos> I brought my friend Lucille.<eos> Ah! Thanks for having me.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> So nice to meet you.
I brought my friend Lucille.<eos> Ah! Thanks for having me.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> So nice to meet you.<eos> Really.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm Kathryn.<eos> - This is my husband John.<eos> - Hi, nice to see you.
With new leads on this author.<eos> And these new leads, Do they have anything to do With this powerful magic you're hiding?<eos> Before I let you in on that secret,<eos> I've got a little job for you.<eos> Hey, we're here.<eos> I said we needed to meet covertly.<eos> Now I see you brought the entire Charming softball team And their pirate mascot?<eos> We were worried about you.<eos> Well, then worry quickly.<eos> I can't be seen with all of you.
And beyond that, I-i don't know.<eos> You're so... Different. I know, and,<eos> After Rumple, it's so nice to... Spend time with someone Who's nothing more than who he says he is.<eos> So you're over him, then, Rumplestiltskin?<eos> I don't know if I can ever be over him.<eos> But for now, will makes me smile.<eos> I'm glad to hear that.<eos> Goodnight, then.<eos> Oh, Killian, uh... About Will.<eos> I was wondering, What h... what happened between you two?
"Oh, a bar crawl on Valentine's Day...<eos> Is this about Nick's breakup with Kai?" No.<eos> - Yeah. - Now you might be asking yourself,<eos> "Is attendance really mandatory?"<eos> You bet it is.<eos> Bar crawl!<eos> Hmm... He's about to crack.<eos> We have to go tonight.<eos> So I have news about a bar Cr...<eos> Was I just out here talking to you guys about the bar crawl?
- I can't wait.<eos> - Give it to me right...<eos> - Yo!<eos> - Go get that girl, dude.<eos> : I don't even know where she is.<eos> I didn't hit you that hard.<eos> Hey.<eos> This, uh, Schmidt's jacket you're wearing?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Not to be a nosy buddy, but sparks are flying like the Wright brothers between you two.
All right.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> Are you gonna stare at that all night?<eos> I'm pacing myself.<eos> She's cute.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> You lied to yourself.<eos> That's kind of your move.<eos> Something's off about you, though, isn't it?<eos> It's always something with you boys.
I told her the wrong town, so I probably bought you a little time, but, uh, just be on the lookout.<eos> I'll be there as soon as I can Jack a ride.<eos> Thanks. Hurry.<eos> Ah.<eos> The six keys of Oz were forged from Oz steel.<eos> They can only be repaired in that magical realm.<eos> So there's no going back?<eos> I can't put my darkness away?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What happened to you in Oz?
How long are you going to keep playing this game?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I told you that we would lead separate lives.<eos> And yet, every day or two, you come here with something to keep me more comfortable.<eos> You don't say anything, but I can feel you pressing me to talk.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> I don't expect you to talk to me or do anything you don't wish to do.<eos> I was thinking, it might be good to get away from the castle for a while... away from the memories.<eos> I haven't yet visited our château in Chambord. Well, that sounds like a very good idea.<eos> I'll come with you, to make sure you're safe.
Francis, you know that.<eos> There must be some way to at least loosen their grip.<eos> When Mary returns, I don't want her to see me cowed and powerless, pretending that I am blind to injustice.<eos> I want her to see the man and the king she thought she married.<eos> Cardinal Perazzo claims the brand is the infallible sign of a Protestant traitor.<eos> But I wonder how he'd explain it if a loyal Catholic were branded.<eos> I sent a page to your quarters.<eos> He said you weren't receiving messages.<eos> I was preparing for the party.<eos> That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
You're beautiful, Lady Atley.<eos> But... another holds my heart.<eos> I can't get her out of my mind.<eos> You love her, but you can't have her, can you?<eos> Well, that's when a man becomes truly obsessed.<eos> What a pity.<eos> A man like you should not go unclaimed.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Now I'm her.<eos> I've watched you for so long.
Will you really go back to French court<eos> - when you leave Chambord?<eos> - Where else would I go?<eos> Have you considered Scotland?<eos> You might be safer there than France.<eos> There is unrest in both countries.<eos> But here you have a husband whose decisions endanger you.<eos> I'm sorry, but it's true.<eos> If it is true or not, it is for me to deal with.<eos> There are things you don't know about my marriage, things I will not share with you.
He's innocent.<eos> Look, is this enough to get him off?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> But we could get his plea withdrawn.<eos> - Where are you, Kalinda?<eos> - I'm coming to you.<eos> No, uh, go to the courthouse.<eos> I will petition for time with Judge Cuesta.<eos> - And I'll meet you there.<eos> - Okay. - I'll meet you there, too.
Look in my eyes.<eos> My eyes are your eyes.<eos> My heart is your heart.<eos> When is it happening?<eos> If all goes according to plan, you'll be a free man in a few hours.<eos> And we'll celebrate.<eos> In Vegas.<eos> I'll even have a little gift for you.<eos> Something you've been dreaming about for a very long time.<eos> I stand before you today a man fulfilled.
They come...<eos> What's that?<eos> No!<eos> - Mommy!<eos> - That's Seth.<eos> Is that Seth?<eos> That's Seth, isn't it?<eos> Mommy!<eos> He's sick, isn't he?<eos> - They tampered with you.
Oh, trust me, if Helena's an abomination, I'm much worse.<eos> Hey.<eos> Next time, she'll bite your head off.<eos> Gracie?<eos> I got to go and do this.<eos> This... child inside me.<eos> You know what it is.<eos> Yes.<eos> I can't do it alone.<eos> I'll be there for both of you.
You know, tracking down long-lost clone children takes time.<eos> She said she'd call if she had any news.<eos> Just a... a wee bit concerned.<eos> Me too.<eos> Then again, we should probably be concerned about this.<eos> Cosima. She's got an Internet date.<eos> Hello, Sapphire.<eos> I can already tell this is going to be a waste of time.<eos> Cos, you're scouting, nothing more.<eos> You're just there for 20 minutes to determine some physical chemistry.
Scott says he and Cosima can get Rachel out of Dyad.<eos> How?<eos> Something to do with his gaming group.<eos> I don't know, it's...<eos> Okay, good, so Krystal is 350 kilometers away.<eos> We leave right now and we can be back by tonight.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Did I just get seconded into this shit?<eos> If you spring Rachel from Dyad, you will destroy this alliance with Delphine.<eos> She's the only person standing between you and Topside.
Let's go.<eos> What about your arm, Armageddon?<eos> - Call security!<eos> Tammy: - I only need one.<eos> - Okay, okay! - Code white.<eos> - I tap! Charlie:<eos> - Stop!<eos> I'm tapping out!<eos> Hey! Hey! All right!<eos> That's the difference between all of you and me!
She collapses onto the canvas like she's given it all she's got.<eos> Crowd just eats it up.<eos> I'm gonna keep you for observation, Kara.<eos> A quick word?<eos> We can keep them separated for now, but, um, this rivalry seems to be problematic.<eos> Well, there's nothing wrong with a little healthy competition.<eos> Yeah, I think the key word there is "healthy."<eos> And, uh, Tammy over there doesn't seem to know when to stop.<eos> No, she doesn't.<eos> Most of our hospital fights involve you and Joel.
Do you know how rare that is?<eos> Breathe.<eos> Just... breathe.<eos> It's all about perspective.<eos> People see what they want, I guess.<eos> Elaine, I look crazy.<eos> I-I-I-I'm...<eos> I'm-I'm seriously...<eos> I'm contemplating suing myself.<eos> I won't sue you. [sighs]
Right, so the only way to prove that is by doing a brain biopsy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're up.<eos> I'm not waking up.<eos> I told you. I need three doctors.<eos> No, you just need yourself.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means I'm thinking you're liking being disembodied a little bit too much.<eos> I get to be me here, do all the things my mind tells me to do, and nobody looks at me funny.<eos> Yeah, but you're still being led by the voices in your head.
It's a difficult diagnosis, yes.<eos> When Julia died, I devoted myself to teaching.<eos> Those kids are all I have.<eos> Of course, all potential foster parents<eos> - have to submit to a psych evaluation.<eos> - Okay.<eos> And then there'd be the home visit.<eos> No problem.<eos> My cleaning lady is there from 10:00 to 3:00.<eos> Uh, no. [chuckles] Uh, visit's with you.
Well, you guys were on opposite sides of a pretty major split about Headless.<eos> You know, Katrina was right to free Abraham when she did.<eos> Turns out that Orion was about to go biblical - on Sleepy Hollow. - Hmm.<eos> But you and Crane are okay?<eos> You talked it out?<eos> We're fine.<eos> And are you lecturing me - about communicating?<eos> - I communicate.<eos> That's what's happening now between us.<eos> Then you can tell me what's going on between you and Hawley.
We're not close.<eos> "A person has two reasons for doing something. One that sounds good..."<eos> And the real reason.<eos> You've been reading Dale Carnegie.<eos> That's...<eos> Don't- - Ridiculous.<eos> I know that book by heart.<eos> Dale's a local boy. Our paths crossed back when...<eos> It's a long story.<eos> But it has come in very handy many times in dealing with you.
If we can bottle the human equivalent of pheromones, we could have exactly what I've been looking for all along.<eos> A "love potion," essentially.<eos> Except there's no conclusive evidence that human pheromones even exist, never mind are ready for packaging.<eos> Oh, they exist.<eos> For example, inexplicably, a few weeks ago, you asked me out to dinner.<eos> It was as if some unseen force compelled you, because every time I've brought it up since, you've managed to worm your way out of it.<eos> No, I have not wormed my way out of it.<eos> Then have dinner with me tonight.<eos> Then drinks down the street at the tap room.<eos> Can I just be honest with you?
"Spend more time with the children."<eos> That's your constant refrain, so that's what I'm gonna do.<eos> Johnny will play, I will coach.<eos> And now I'm late for my dinner.<eos> You have a dinner?<eos> It's work, Lib, like always.<eos> I've told all my friends, Bill, that we have a famous author in our family now.<eos> Edna keeps expecting to see you hobnob on Linkletter's "House Party."<eos> Well, if by "family," you mean your daughter, certainly there would be no book at all without her participation.<eos> It's just such a rare treat to spend quality time with you, Bill.
Sure talked to him long enough.<eos> Well, you're on the same side now. And I want it to go well.<eos> I'm gonna go read.<eos> It'll be all right.<eos> I'll be there to make sure it is.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Good evening, Dr. Masters.<eos> I would just like to say that we are very honored to have you at our hotel.<eos> The wife brought home your book and just having it in the house has put some real pizzazz into things.<eos> And Mrs. Johnson is with you.
Pawning off his poor baby to some babysitter when you're going off to do your sex work.<eos> It's not "sex work," mother.<eos> "Sex work" is what prostitutes do.<eos> Well, try and explain the difference to my friends.<eos> Well, why don't you tell your friends that your daughter has co-authored a seminal work on human sexuality and she's supporting herself, handsomely, from the proceeds?<eos> You know what this needs?<eos> It needs a little marmalade.<eos> Hi. You're very unpopular this morning.<eos> They're all from Ronald Sturgis and pals, those religious weirdos who've been hanging out in the lobby this whole week.<eos> What happened to you?
Hope it does?<eos> All right, let's just sit down and take a breath.<eos> Don't you?<eos> Don't you want him to love you more?<eos> The truth.<eos> I do, yes.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> So, where does that leave me?<eos> Well, I guess that leaves you with your ear pinned against the door, terrified of what's going on inside.<eos> What has gotten into you?
I will be fine.<eos> Paul, I am making this easy for you.<eos> I don't need it to be easy.<eos> I want you to be happy.<eos> Libby, I am happy with you.<eos> I want you to be with someone else.<eos> Dr. Masters.<eos> Are you in the mood for being escorted from the premises again, Ronald?<eos> Well, if that's what it takes.<eos> The Lord has made certain knowledge available to me, and I am compelled to share that knowledge with you.
I'm hiding from you because I do not want to have this conversation. Why?<eos> What did Virginia say?<eos> First of all, there is nothing going on between her and Logan.<eos> Well, of course she said that now.<eos> But what if you were to take her out for dinner, you know?<eos> - Maybe have a drink or two?<eos> - No!<eos> My responsibilities here are varied and far-reaching, but reffing a fight between mommy and daddy is not one of them.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> Maybe I can spare you a lot of grief by sharing with you a tidbit I've picked up-- one you seem to have missed.
I could call him in an instant and have you arrested.<eos> I'm just here waiting for my typewriter to be fixed.<eos> Just leave my patients alone.<eos> I feel sorry for you, Mrs. Johnson.<eos> Dr. Masters has brainwashed you.<eos> He's warped your mind, and as a result, you've lost your way.<eos> You are not the woman you once were.<eos> And because you know me so well, you are certainly qualified to make that assessment.<eos> I hope they fix your typewriter.<eos> God knows what that man has done to you, what you've become -- tarnished, confused, a life removed from all that is good.
Are you Jewish?<eos> To me?<eos> Well-- well, we could never have gotten to this point without your financial support.<eos> Well, that's, uh...<eos> That's kind of you to say, Bill.<eos> Well, it's absolutely true.<eos> - Isn't it, Virginia? - It is.<eos> Uh, you have kept us afloat.<eos> And I am happy to report that the advance we received today will more than cover our operational costs from now on.<eos> So we're not just able to repay you in full. We're also able to provide you with a significant return on your investment.
I think it's a little awkward, don't you, seeing as how my husband's in love with you?<eos> Don't insult me by acting surprised.<eos> Danny told me. He-- he told you...<eos> He always tells me.<eos> We've been through this before.<eos> Did you think you were different?<eos> They all do.<eos> Enjoy him, Virginia.<eos> He's a lovely man.<eos> He'll always open the door for you, he'll never forget your birthday, whisk you away on business trips, and take you in his arms and dance with you even though there's no music playing.
But in those days it was.<eos> Well, it was the Depression. Quite.<eos> Supposedly, though,<eos> Jimmy could be very charming.<eos> Unless you were a soldier.<eos> Mr. Blunt.<eos> I saw your show tonight.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You may be the only one who did.<eos> - Are you all right?
*I'm able to teach you*<eos> *And I know how to reach you*<eos> *Miss Cindy, she's a sexy little thing*<eos> *Miss Cindy, she's a sexy little thing*<eos> *Miss Cindy, you're a sexy little thing*<eos> *Miss Cindy, you're a sexy little thing*<eos> Get the fuck off of me. Fucking loser.<eos> Go snort some coke, you fucking idiot.<eos> Excuse me, Miss.<eos> Is everything all right? - Yeah, you want a date?
Oh, my God!<eos> Major?<eos> Major?<eos> Don't leave me.<eos> Major, don't leave me.<eos> Major, don't leave me.<eos> Major.<eos> Harry.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Are you all right?
I have got a thrilling passage to read.<eos> Um, did I just smell alcohol on your breath?<eos> Aftershave.<eos> Here.<eos> Take two.<eos> Come on.<eos> What's happened to all our coffee mugs?<eos> - It's weird.<eos> - I know, it's confusing.<eos> Guys, can I tell you something personal and strange and homoerotic that's bothering me?
First my brother and then you, hmm?<eos> You left us no choice.<eos> Well...<eos> Oh, I didn't hear you come in.<eos> - How was your walk?<eos> - Good.<eos> I needed it to, um... clear my head, work through some stuff.<eos> Yeah, I bet.<eos> Hearing thousands of people chant your name in unison, that's got to be...<eos> Your brother would like to see you.
Today, in a stunning reversal for the controversial president, Al-Fayeed, who only days ago...<eos> Uncle.<eos> - Molly.<eos> - General.<eos> Sammy.<eos> - Big day.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Present... arms!<eos> Order arms!<eos> My fellow Abuddinians, I come before you today at a critical moment in the history of our country.
Without telling me?<eos> I took an online course.<eos> Finished last night.<eos> Are you surprised?<eos> Can we talk for a second?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Castle, the PI's license doesn't change anything.<eos> The DA's still not gonna let you investigate with us.<eos> Oh, you see, that's the brilliant part.<eos> I'm not going to be investigating with you.
And then she ends up dead, and you find this at the scene?<eos> You're claiming someone is framing you?<eos> I'm a criminal prosecutor.<eos> Do you honestly think that I would be stupid enough to leave a piece of evidence like this behind?<eos> Look, I made my name fighting corporate greed.<eos> And my political ambitions are no secret to anyone.<eos> This...<eos> Don't you see? This is the perfect way for my enemies to destroy me.<eos> Okay, there's only one problem with that theory, Mr. Elliot.<eos> In order to frame you, a person would need to know that you were there at that party 15 years ago, and know that Shana Baker had just come from seeing you an hour earlier.
So, I assume Elliot has had barbecue recently.<eos> Just last week, at a rib joint Uptown.<eos> We scrubbed the security video, and you'll never guess who we found digging through the ash can for one of Elliot's cigarette butts.<eos> No way!<eos> That's our Michael Clayton?<eos> Likely hired by whoever's behind all of this to befriend Shana, whisper in her ear and urge her to investigate.<eos> And who ensured we followed the trail to Radnor.<eos> Oof. I wish I could see the look on their face when you slap the cuffs on them.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe you can.<eos> Mr. Castle, I got an urgent call to meet you here regarding Shana Baker.
Legend says she was strong and powerful.<eos> Well, that's exactly what I want to be.<eos> Ursula, wait!<eos> Now I'm even more powerful than you.<eos> And the whole sea will be at the mercy of my every whim.<eos> You don't need to protect me, father.<eos> You need to fear me.<eos> Ursula, you don't need to do this.<eos> That's where you're wrong.<eos> I can't have him leave with you.
But it's five years old.<eos> Emma, what is it?<eos> This is in Lowell, Massachusetts, which is less than 30 miles outside of Boston, which is where I lived five years ago.<eos> Lily and I grew up in Minnesota, separated as kids, and ended up living less than an hour apart as adults?<eos> Like I said... fate.<eos> You're connected.<eos> It's been pushing you together.<eos> It may have been pushing us together as kids, but...<eos> Last time I saw her, I'm the one who pushed her away.<eos> What exactly happened between you two?
We are thankful Lily could join us to be our guest, and let these gifts to us be blessed.<eos> Amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> Sorry about the takeout, but with all the packing...<eos> Hey, I love it.<eos> The whole vibe.<eos> Homework, chore wheel, house rules.<eos> Like Norman Rockwell blew up in this place.<eos> Emma seems really lucky to have ended up with you guys.
Take a look at this.<eos> This page... It says my happy ending is possible, doesn't it?<eos> I mean, it has to exist for a reason.<eos> Whoa.<eos> I wrote this.<eos> I mean, the story with this drawing in it, from my...<eos> Well, a-a little experimental writing I did for another book that I never got the chance to write.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> It just turned up one day in Robin's things.<eos> I don't know how that happened, but it... yeah, it suggests that something is looking out for you.
Perhaps.<eos> I didn't mean to kill you.<eos> Though, to be fair, I didn't have a heart.<eos> So it's my fault?<eos> What I think he means to say is...<eos> We are sory.<eos> Eh, you don't need to be sorry.<eos> Although I do intend to hold it over your heads for a very long time.<eos> I think we both know what happened in that world was not real.<eos> Although, seeing you guys as real villains made me sorry for holding a grudge against you for so long.
My friend, you still breathe.<eos> My heart swells.<eos> The celebration is yours.<eos> It is your rightful place.<eos> You are a betrayer.<eos> Fate is not what you are given.<eos> It is what you take.<eos> (ankhe) god!<eos> My people!<eos> I stand before you,
I have prayed to tawaret, And i'm confident she's heard me.<eos> And if she hasn't?<eos> The girl is from amurru.<eos> With a mitanni name, she's not even of pure egyptian blood.<eos> And there cannot be a mitanni heir.<eos> You must have a son by any means.<eos> Is that another proposal?<eos> It's a consideration.<eos> I will have his child.<eos> I'm sorry, vizier, can i speak to you?
He sees the mitanni as his greatest enemy.<eos> You were in his way, my lord.<eos> That is why he made his move against you.<eos> So am i to forgive him for being a loyal egyptian?<eos> No.<eos> The vizier is right.<eos> Treason is treason.<eos> But there's a far greater enemy to be fought right now.<eos> There is no one they fear more than general horemheb.<eos> Let him think you have his trust So that he will fight the mitanni alongside you.
It is not their only disadvantage.<eos> Bring me your best commanders, General, no more than 40.<eos> What good are 40 men going to do against a...<eos> I know another way into the Mitanni palace.<eos> They will not see us coming.<eos> Have your men made ready.<eos> Lagus, arrange for plenty of wine among my gift to the Mitanni.<eos> Pardon, Pharaoh, the gods must be satisfied before you face this challenge.<eos> You speak to the Pharaoh of tribute when we face annihilation?<eos> The gods watch you.
It's too dangerous.<eos> Something happened that night, something people are willing to kill to find out, and whatever it was involved my father.<eos> I'm not doing this for Braxton or for you.<eos> I'm doing it for me.<eos> I need to know the truth.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I'll have it to you by 9:00.<eos> I thought you said you had it already.<eos> And I do.<eos> I wanted that Fulcrum in my hands before I negotiated with you.
The Elegant Doily Retirement Home?<eos> Oh, that's right down the street.<eos> Sometimes your wanderers come here.<eos> Well, I don't know if your grandson is still coming to visit... who is he?<eos> Oh, Zeke.<eos> I'll see if I can find him for you.<eos> Zeke was telling the truth.<eos> Perma-pass!<eos> We can do anything we want within limits!<eos> Hey, uh, guys, listen, I owe you both an apology.
- 19, and then 97 more of probation and then I am a free woman.<eos> - (Cellphone ringing)<eos> - Lucky you. Crap. It's my aunt.<eos> She's watching Sam. Hey, is he okay?<eos> What? You said you could watch him till 4:00. No, I can't leave early.<eos> Come on.<eos> Don't do this to me, please.<eos> Kennish, get to work painting over that graffiti.<eos> Whitewash is in the van.<eos> Hey, Gordon, can I talk to you - for a second?
Oh, you're choking.<eos> You're totally choking.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> My sister taught me the Heimlich maneuver.<eos> - (Coughing) - Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> You... you okay?<eos> Hey.<eos> Okay, you're gonna be fine.
This is no scam.<eos> Teddy and I were married four months ago, so your conversation was not a recent one.<eos> Your husband dies a week ago, and the first thing you do is hop on a plane to the Hamptons, and rather than telling me that my father-in-law passed away, you spend two days concealing your true identity.<eos> And for what?<eos> To go party-hopping, or to embarrass me in front of my friends?<eos> I'll give you ladies some privacy.<eos> Oh, we don't need privacy.<eos> We need a judge.<eos> This will is fraudulent.<eos> I came to the Hamptons early to see what kind of a person you are, to meet you in a circumstance where you're not predisposed to hate me.
The computer in question is air-gapped, which means it's untouched by the Internet and therefore unhackable.<eos> Someone broke in to the server room to get at it at 10:37.<eos> You know the exact moment?<eos> I receive an alert anytime the computer is turned on.<eos> By the time I got to it, the server room was empty.<eos> Do you have any idea what they were after?<eos> Not sure.<eos> It's possible I arrived before they could finish the job.<eos> Well, we have your visitors' log and your security footage, so we'll start there.<eos> In the meantime, do you know anyone who could be targeting you?
Nice bracelet.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Aah!<eos> Aah!<eos> Aah!<eos> Is that Natalie?<eos> Hey.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Hi.<eos> I think I owe you an apology.
And we are thrilled to announce some exciting and highly profitable new initiatives on the horizon.<eos> We got to go.<eos> SRU just confirmed. Agent Burke's being released.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Outside the city.<eos> --construction of three new schools for the people of this great country.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And now I'll take a few questions.<eos> Commander Kushan.<eos> It's good to meet you.
We talk all the time.<eos> He'd have told me if he was going on a trip like that.<eos> Maybe it was a last-minute decision.<eos> Brett served two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan.<eos> Retired last year.<eos> If he was thinking about going on vacation, believe me, it wasn't to that part of the world.<eos> I promise we'll try and find out what happened.<eos> Mrs. Boris...<eos> Um, I'm sorry.<eos> Has anybody from the press tried to contact you?
Okay.<eos> This backpack Samila was carrying when she died.<eos> My contact at the Turkish National Police says they recovered a laptop in it.<eos> - Do they know what's on it?<eos> - No.<eos> It's encrypted.<eos> Well... with Samila out of the picture, that may be our only hope for a lead in the Marsh investigation.<eos> Or it can screw us if it falls into the wrong hands.<eos> Madam Secretary.<eos> I wish I could say it's nice to finally meet you.
Yeah, but I...<eos> I can't right now.<eos> I have a history test in a few minutes,<eos> And if I don't get my grade in, I might lose my spot at Savannah.<eos> "Good luck on your test.<eos> Hope your ankle's better.<eos> Dinner tonight?"<eos> Andrew.<eos> Yeah, Andrew Campbell.<eos> Is there something going on between you two?
What are those?<eos> Ali was talking to somebody through the personal ads.<eos> People turn on the microphone and anonymously record any secret they want to with the understanding that a stranger is gonna sit at this table and listen to a random whisper.<eos> Tanner saw both of us there.<eos> After she takes me down, she can go after you too, and it will be all my fault.<eos> Ashley, will you marry me?<eos> Andrew?<eos> Is there something going on between you two?
You know, we call it and it just rings, no pick up, no voice mail, nothing.<eos> Yeah, and meanwhile Neilan's Law Office is closed and locked.<eos> But the number appearing twice...<eos> It's got to mean something, we just have to figure it out.<eos> What if we don't figure it out in time?<eos> The three of you are gonna be late for school.<eos> Uh, no, Mom, teacher's conference.<eos> They dropped the first two periods.<eos> I told you.<eos> Oh, then, uh, this is my chance to talk to all of you.
Send it.<eos> What if we're not on the same book club?<eos> Then we'll figure out something else?<eos> Ali's running out of time.<eos> And so is Hanna.<eos> I know.<eos> Spence, are you gonna be there tomorrow at the trial?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Listen, you guys, I have to go do something.<eos> So I'll talk to you all later.
Whatever.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Actually, you might.<eos> This could be sauce.<eos> That girl will never talk to us.<eos> And if Aria's mom won't help us, we have to ask Toby.<eos> He's a policeman, Spencer.<eos> And if Kendra's such a good girl, she's not gonna lie to someone wearing that uniform.<eos> Just please forget about Toby.<eos> What happened between you two in that stairwell?
Did you take archery?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Well, let's refresh your memory.<eos> You not only took it, you were darn good at it.<eos> Can you explain to the jury how you managed to beat out every camper when the contest requires shooting at five separate targets from the same spot?<eos> Alison?<eos> Your Honor, can you instruct the witness to answer the question?<eos> - _ - Miss DiLaurentis, please answer Mr. Sirk's question.<eos> Counselor, would you please repeat the question for the witness?<eos> Lieutenant, I need to speak with you.
Dead ringer.<eos> So I gave Roman this big pile of nothin'to chew on.<eos> Hope it's enough to keep him paying out.<eos> But I don't know. Seems mighty thin.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I think it's time I told you the truth about my son.<eos> The Vikings, right?<eos> Terror of the northern seas, axes dripping with blood, villages burned to the ground.<eos> Rape.<eos> Oh, if you two ever fell in their clutches, I shudder to think what they'd do to you.
I really ought to show you the basement sometime.<eos> Because there are some wondrous things to see down there.<eos> Because the times, baby, they are a-changing.<eos> You don't want to fuck with Croatian pussy, my friend.<eos> Sucks you right inside.<eos> Time stands still.<eos> Till, finally, you have to claw your way back out like you're being born again.<eos> A lot of fish had to fuck to make that much caviar, huh?<eos> You were smart to come to us.<eos> Been wanting to get into business with you guys for a while.
- They don't care about that.<eos> They treat you like a criminal, and it's hard to remember that you're not one.<eos> The first night's the hardest.<eos> You're locked away from everything and everyone you ever cared about.<eos> And when they turn those lights out, it is the loneliest feeling you could ever imagine.<eos> Second thought, I could have used a thick coat of sugar.<eos> You can't be ready for how it feels, Em.<eos> It's hard not to give up on hope.<eos> You guys, they can take everything from us, but they can't take us from each other.<eos> I don't care how far apart from you guys I am, I will still be with you.
I moved a lot.<eos> Assimilating was key.<eos> Oh, and by the way, calling somebody weird in Portland is actually a compliment, so thank you, Nick.<eos> It's just... Oh.<eos> Sorry, I thought I heard my phone ringing.<eos> Ryan's supposed to call me before he gets on the plane.<eos> - Oh!<eos> Sorry.<eos> - Jess, just take your phone out.<eos> No, Nick, I want to be here with you guys.
Then she dropped to one knee, fired three more shots, took out male number four.<eos> And by then she had lost too much blood.<eos> Well, that is most certainly not a coincidence.<eos> Someone is recreating murders from your past, Gibbs.<eos> Why?<eos> Five bodies turn up, staged to mirror the gunfight that killed Director Shepard in California.<eos> Then another body appears, this time mirroring Mike Franks' murder.<eos> Both were NCIS.<eos> Both pivotal figures in your life.<eos> Somebody's gaslighting you, boss.
Be right back.<eos> Be there in a second.<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> What?<eos> Nothing!<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - Who?<eos> My wife.<eos> I followed you here.
Did drill tell you that?<eos> When?<eos> Before or after they picked up bits of him off the floor?<eos> [ chuckles ] Drill said you'd try to get under our skin.<eos> Drill only talks to children.<eos> How do you -- Because drill doesn't just discard his friends, mr. Bennigan.<eos> He doesn't move them aside When someone more useful comes along.<eos> Once drill makes you his friend, you're his friend for life.<eos> You didn't meet drill recently, did you?<eos> You met him when you were just a girl.
Sure, I was following him.<eos> This is good.<eos> Prosecutor will understand if you come clean.<eos> I didn't kill him though.<eos> I was waiting for him to mess up, so I could get him locked up again.<eos> I followed him with a camera every chance I got.<eos> Maybe since he was keeping his nose so clean, you got a little frustrated, impatient.<eos> I have rights, too, you know.<eos> It's not just the criminals that have rights.<eos> And I don't think I want to talk to you anymore.
Didn't you? Huh?<eos> Yup.<eos> And you know why?<eos> Because I enjoy killing.<eos> Dogs, cats, people.<eos> Kill, kill, kill.<eos> It's a calling, really.<eos> So you better keep that in mind when you go to sleep tonight.<eos> 'Cause this doesn't close.<eos> And I'll be watching you.
Well, Sir Edmund didn't actually ride on Tenzing Norgay's back.<eos> Well, however he got there, - we'll be right there with you.<eos> - Right.<eos> Norville Knox.<eos> Godfrey's very own Tenha Norway.<eos> Dr. Johann Pryce, of course.<eos> I'm an aficionado of your work.<eos> Your paper on glycosylated hemoglobin?<eos> That led to some delicious advances by my own team.<eos> It is an absolute honor to meet you, sir.
Causing me to say, "What's up?"<eos> I, uh... asked her to come away with me.<eos> To run away would be more accurate, 'cause I can't stay here.<eos> I'm afraid of being caught for what I did.<eos> That's my disease of self, rearing its ugly head, because... because what I was really asking her to do was hide herself from the world.<eos> She's already done enough hiding.<eos> It wouldn't be fair.<eos> I wish things could be different... but I'm all out of wishes.<eos> So with this siren song as my swan song...<eos> I bid you all adieu.
Persistent little buggers, aren't you?<eos> Good for you.<eos> Good for you!<eos> It's Peter, right?<eos> I don't think we've been properly introduced.<eos> Government's name is Arnold Spivak.<eos> You can call me, uh...<eos> Oh, it doesn't matter.<eos> Miranda spoke very highly of you.<eos> Both of you, actually, no matter how hard I prodded her, and boy, did I, I could never, weirdly, get her to pick a favorite between you two fellas.
I assure you, the whole of the king's troops in New York does not exceed 3,500 men.<eos> How did you come by this intelligence?<eos> Are you certain it's accurate?<eos> Completely.<eos> Because you risk the entire army.<eos> If you're not up to leading the men, Charles, then I will.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Your Excellency.<eos> - Marquis.<eos> Tell me, Lafayette, did Albany agree with you?
I can't let this pass without answers.<eos> Can we send in military to secure the area?<eos> The host government has made it abundantly clear, any large footprint from military or law enforcement will be considered an illegal occupation.<eos> What about a small footprint?<eos> Navy could get us in there off the books, under the radar.<eos> Well, if you can get in, we do have equipment that will make your limited time on target worthwhile.<eos> So what's the plan?<eos> Would you see if Harris gave his commanders any Intel on terror threats?<eos> Wait.<eos> We're not going with you?
Let us know what you find.<eos> Come on.<eos> Who's gonna have your back?<eos> He is.<eos> He's got mine.<eos> Be safe.<eos> See you in a few days.<eos> See you.<eos> Captain Beck?<eos> The agents are here to see you.
What about outside of Tunisia?<eos> Do you know anyone that was involved that wasn't in Tunisia?<eos> Only Harris's boss.<eos> Captain Beck.<eos> I believe he was in charge of it.<eos> What is it?<eos> Your security detail may be protecting the wrong person.<eos> If the terrorists were after Harris in Tunisia and that failed...<eos> They're probably in L.A. to get Captain Beck.<eos> Not you, Ambassador.
The belt should stop the bleeding.<eos> Approaching.<eos> It's us.<eos> Did you get him?<eos> Uh, yeah, I winged him.<eos> He got away.<eos> How's he doing?<eos> It's arterial-- he'll need a hospital.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> I want to stay with you.
Look, you don't have to be a jerk about it, okay?<eos> I'm just saying leave the thinking to the rest of us, you know?<eos> Stick to what you're good at, throwing up your dinner.<eos> You know what?<eos> Screw all of you.<eos> Can you believe her?<eos> I can't believe you.<eos> Annabel told us how you wanted to go to the cops and rat us out?<eos> She doesn't know what she's talking about.<eos> Oh, I hope so, because I would hate to see something happen to you as well.
What do we do?<eos> Well, we can tell someone, end it all now.<eos> That's what you want, right?<eos> What, did Will send you to check up on me?<eos> No, Will did not send me here to check up on you.<eos> I don't always agree with how Will handles things.<eos> Just call me if anything else happens, okay?<eos> You can trust me.<eos> Cam, wait.<eos> You should know he probably has an insurance policy on you too, something to hang over you if you cause trouble.
Heidi Wilkes?<eos> Shame what happened to her.<eos> I'm sure you're broken up about her death.<eos> Yeah, no, of course I was.<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> You were seeing her, weren't you?<eos> Uh, I don't know who told you that, but you have the wrong information.<eos> Huh.<eos> It's funny.<eos> I just got that impression considering the text history between the two of you on her phone.
What's wrong?<eos> Is there some sort of emergency or something?<eos> I forgot my contacts.<eos> Will, I don't need you to be able to see.<eos> I need you to stand over there and look pretty.<eos> Oh.<eos> We can... we can totally Photoshop that out, no problem.<eos> Jesus, Dad.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Your mother insisted that I take three days out of our vacation and that I fly home immediately and speak to you in person.
I'm Miranda.<eos> Your friend, the one that you talk about sometimes, he's teaching you to be a detective?<eos> I was wondering if you could help me with something.<eos> Her name is Tess.<eos> How many days has she been gone now?<eos> Three.<eos> She's done this before-- let me worry while she partied and crashed with friends.<eos> But I've called everyone I can think of.<eos> They say she isn't with them.<eos> You're not wearing a wedding band-- is Dad not in the picture?
It's made for the express purpose of resisting extreme heat.<eos> It's a logical choice for an organization in the habit of burning people alive, right?<eos> Can't be too many places that sell this stuff.<eos> Military surplus, fire and rescue gear.<eos> I'll make a few calls and get that sketch out there.<eos> HOLMES: You will recall, however, that Clay Dubrovensky was not bound with para-aramid rope, further suggesting he was not killed by the cartel. BELL:<eos> You still like Barbara Conway?<eos> Watson and I still believe that she had motive to want him dead.<eos> Plus, she worked with these two.<eos> You're right, I was not entirely forthcoming with you yesterday.
Butitdidn'tgowell .<eos> I think I should call my lawyer.<eos> You could, but I wouldn't.<eos> He'll tell you to leave.<eos> And this is your one, best chance to show contrition, to try and make people understand that you did not mean to kill Clay or the Kelleys.<eos> Like I said, I don't think you went to Clay's that night with the intention of killing him.<eos> You didn't show up with a hollowed-out tire, which means you had to go out and get one right after it happened.<eos> Now, my colleagues are combing the area around Clay's apartment right now.<eos> It is only a matter of time before someone recognizes your picture.<eos> Now, they know I'm talking to you right now, Barbara.
Should you succeed, you'll know where to find me.<eos> I believe this is what was used to poison your father and me.<eos> Where did you find it?<eos> In a Lady's dress.<eos> Without doubt a poison.<eos> Oleander.<eos> Do you know the person who made this?<eos> All too well.<eos> Sorry to disturb you, Sire.<eos> But Madame insisted on seeing you.
"the stress is too much." and cameron was all, "what's your damage?"<eos> Or something.<eos> And nate was saying that he wanted to go to the police And tell them what had happened and stuff, And cameron wigged.<eos> He was like,<eos> "that wasn't the deal.<eos> You're not going to the police.<eos> "think about the money." blah-blah-blah.<eos> It was super intense.<eos> The money?<eos> Girl: I need to talk to you.
And if there's anything i learned from i know what you didlastsummer,one and two , It's that me and cameron are next on the killer's revenge list.<eos> You saw i know what you didlastsummer2?<eos> There should be a third one called,<eos> "seriously, i'msonoteverforgetting whatyoudidlastsummer."<eos> -(chuckling hesitantly) miss moore.<eos> -I'm kinda right.<eos> I'm not dicking around.<eos> Look, someone out there is waiting to murder me.<eos> You guys have to do something.<eos> I'm going to make arrangements to send an officer home with you.
"We gonna make 'em pay for what they did to Cold Crush back in the day."<eos> And wait till you hear Snoop's new one, "Peaches and Cream," honey.<eos> My brother.<eos> Hakeem Lyon's album debuts the day that Empire goes public, and in a moment, you're gonna meet the man<eos> (quietly): Where is he?<eos> I don't know.<eos> WOMAN: Tonight you're touting your son Hakeem's upcoming release, but your son Jamal already dropped an album.<eos> What are your thoughts about it?<eos> Well, you said it best when you said tonight we're talking about Hakeem.<eos> WOMAN 2: The Source compared him to you.
- I'm sorry. I just- - I just wandered in.<eos> Well, it's an open house, right?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> And-- and the realtor said there was a-- there was a home office, and I've always wanted one.<eos> Listen, this is a great house.<eos> You should buy it.<eos> But whatever you do, turn this room into a den.<eos> When you have a home office, you use it.<eos> You come home, you barely have dinner, and you keep working.<eos> You bring work home, and your wife starts to resent it, resent you.
[man] wait.<eos> What happened?<eos> I thought you were going to renovate this place.<eos> As did I, but I was betrayed<eos> By a lying little country music wannabe.<eos> [cheryl] was that directed at me?<eos> Yes!<eos> Who else?<eos> I don't know who all lies to you!<eos> [intercom beeps] also, there's a mr. Slater to see you.
He's in here, you ritzy ditz!<eos> [computer shatters] [distorted voice] what are you doing, dave?<eos> So, uh, should I come back?<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Of course not.<eos> Yeah, that's what I was thinking.<eos> I mean, whatever the task, we are up to it.<eos> We are professional and-- [intercom beeps]<eos> There's a mr. Slater to see you.
But I can't read either.<eos> Can't concentrate.<eos> It's odd.<eos> I've...<eos> I've never had that problem.<eos> I think it's because...<eos> I don't know where she is.<eos> I always know where she is.<eos> Well, she's right here.<eos> It's just as if she's asleep in the bed next to you.
Uh, nice to meet you.<eos> It's just seeing you... so mature.<eos> Right, no.<eos> I-I know.<eos> Aah! Aah! Let go!<eos> Zoe!<eos> Leave me alone or I swear I will scream!<eos> I'm not here to hurt you.<eos> I'm here to help.<eos> I know what's happening to you.
Then I stared spending more time in my fantasy relationships than in my real one and... we split up for a while.<eos> Mike doesn't know he's not the father.<eos> Who is the father?<eos> There were a few one-night stands.<eos> I'm not proud of it.<eos> What's wrong with my baby?<eos> It's... it-it's like it's carrying a virus.<eos> And it affects the fetus.<eos> And the mother.<eos> But it happened to you and you're alive.
And congratulations.<eos> She is spectacular.<eos> Charlie, we can fix this, tweak the algorithms.<eos> Keep telling yourself that.<eos> I'm General Tobias Shepherd.<eos> Yeah, I know who you are, General.<eos> I'm familiar with your work.<eos> Second K, right?<eos> Second Kuwait War, yes.<eos> But you and I had very different wars, Mr. Richter.
Toby, please.<eos> You made me lie to Congress.<eos> What if I told them the truth?<eos> That you knew about this so-called invasion... but you kept it hidden.<eos> Your word against mine.<eos> I'd pass that BMI polygraph in two seconds.<eos> You would be discredited.<eos> Lose your stripes, your honor.<eos> Everything.<eos> How do I get in touch with you?
Lose your stripes, your honor.<eos> Everything.<eos> How do I get in touch with you?<eos> You have 24 hours to talk to your people.<eos> Then we'll be in touch.<eos> - Toby, where the hell have you been?<eos> - We need to assemble the team.<eos> First there is something you need to see.<eos> Can you tell me what you told the nurse?<eos> What is happening to you?
- There was a nice old lady.<eos> - And she gave me her umbrella.<eos> - It had a hole in it.<eos> I was soaked.<eos> So you have all the same memories?<eos> Yeah, Lucas and Lucy, they share the same neural programming.<eos> - They all do.<eos> - Our memories were installed.<eos> We didn't have the luxury of learning by experience, like you.<eos> But I want to have memories with both of you, too.
- Terra.<eos> - You came back.<eos> Of course.<eos> - Hey. - Oh.<eos> Hey there.<eos> Find out how long we'll be here?<eos> Um... I just got a special security clearance.<eos> - We are going home tonight.<eos> - That's good.<eos> Uh, Ethan asked if Lucas and I could spend the night with you guys.
Anything else for my two favourite customers?<eos> Actually, I've got something for you... - ..a leaving present. - You sweetheart!<eos> Do you have a suitor, my dear?<eos> - Are you offering, Mr. Welkin?<eos> - If you'll do me the honour... Me too.<eos> I'd make you a fine husband.<eos> - You've already got a girlfriend.<eos> - Don't listen to him.<eos> You're the only one for me.<eos> It's not fair to ask me to choose between you. I love you both.
March!<eos> Left, right...<eos> Oi! No. You can't park here, this is a parade ground.<eos> How am I supposed to know that?<eos> Good morning. I'm RSM Davis, this is Lieutenant Graham.<eos> - Father Brown.<eos> - Lady Felicia Montague.<eos> Mrs. McCarthy, parish secretary.<eos> It's an honour to be invited to such a solemn occasion.<eos> The Kembles appreciate the fundraising - you've done for the memorial.
Has it really been 13 years?<eos> Looking at you, I'd swear it couldn't possibly be so long.<eos> Charming as ever, Laurence.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Some of the men wondered if we'd ever see Blighty again.<eos> Outnumbered, trapped...<eos> Then we saw the Colonel striding out of the trees.<eos> You, sir, were a giant.<eos> If the Jerries thought the Third would go down without a fight they had another thing coming.<eos> We would have followed you to the ends of the earth.
- Yes.<eos> The message is meant to be triggered if a Humanich breaks protocol and kills a human being.<eos> It happened.<eos> They're not just killing hybrids.<eos> They're killing humans, too.<eos> One human.<eos> Nate Malone was a hybrid sympathizer.<eos> Thankfully, Lucy took action.<eos> Your hard work on ethical adaptor algorithms paid off.<eos> Can I speak to you alone for a second?
- Asleep?<eos> - Response to the grid shutdown.<eos> And then, after that, you'd have maybe 30 seconds to get the job done before you'd be caught and killed.<eos> And you'd need someone on the inside.<eos> So you're saying there is a way to do this.<eos> I'm saying there's no way for this to happen without somebody being killed.<eos> CORRINE: Madam Secretary?<eos> You have a visitor.<eos> They found him wandering outside the gates.<eos> Said he needed to talk to you, that it was urgent.
Said he needed to talk to you, that it was urgent.<eos> Ethan.<eos> What's going on?<eos> There isn't much time.<eos> LUCY: Time for what?<eos> Hey, little brother.<eos> I've missed you.<eos> I missed you, too.<eos> A visit from a special boy like you deserves a special treat.<eos> Oh. I'll join you.
That server, fifth panel.<eos> Ethan...<eos> Sweetheart, I'm sorry.<eos> Something is happening.<eos> [distorted]: Julie, something is happening.<eos> Okay, just stay with me.<eos> We gotta get you out of here.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> - Charlie, let's go!<eos> - I'm right behind you.
We are the collest when the sweet ladies greet us with kisses<eos> We are the coolest when we cruise When we head through the city<eos> We are the coolest, never on loose Because we rule when we cruise<eos> What?<eos> There is she:<eos> Birte Schottenhammel.<eos> The Birte aka new grilfriend of your husband?<eos> Remain quite cool.<eos> Frau Reimann?<eos> I have to talk to you.
I'm going to Jerusalem, too.<eos> What?<eos> I need to know what's happening to my father.<eos> Mary, why don't you go with her?<eos> We'll manage here.<eos> Peter's your father?<eos> I've heard lots about him.<eos> I'm Stephen.<eos> Maya.<eos> Can I join you?
Were you prepared to die?<eos> Yes.<eos> And if this is the result, I'm prepared to do it again.<eos> My friends, when I left here, there was little more than a handful of us hiding.<eos> Timid.<eos> Waiting.<eos> But now I return to find we are already beyond counting!<eos> We have found each other in faith, and now we must honor that.<eos> We must provide for each other as we draw strength from each other.<eos> The man beside you stands because you are there to hold him up.
You're killing scientific curiosity.<eos> I admire the work you have done, but your scientific curiosity has led you dangerously close to forces that you could never have controlled.<eos> They would have destroyed you.<eos> They saved us from ourselves.<eos> Why are we being kept in the dark?<eos> You now have peace, and the way has been prepared for your successors.<eos> I'd like to thank everybody who worked on the World Federation Observation Orbital.<eos> I'd like to probably turn that into an acronym as well.<eos> And, please enjoy the rest of the evening.<eos> Mrs. Greggson, I realize this might seem like an odd request, but the Supervisor would like to meet with you... privately.
This gentleman wants to fly me to South Africa for a job interview.<eos> Your whole family's invited.<eos> - Milo Rodricks.<eos> - Jake Greggson.<eos> - Here's my card.<eos> - He's here.<eos> The supervisor for Earth.<eos> You're killing scientific curiosity.<eos> Your scientific curiosity would've destroyed you.<eos> The supervisor would like to meet with you.

We won't talk shop.<eos> I promise.<eos> I mean, the food's gonna suck, but...<eos> Listen, I...<eos> You haven't even met...<eos> You haven't even met Alison and Jason.<eos> She's delicate and very confused.<eos> Well, given what she's endured, I'm not surprised.<eos> She's afraid she'll be punished, and very worried about deportation.<eos> I'm very sorry about everything - that happened to you.
It involves a third party.<eos> Then, do you have an alibi for the night of the murder?<eos> No.<eos> ~ Not now.<eos> ~ From Father Brown, sir.<eos> You may want to see this.<eos> I'm halting the interview for a tea break.<eos> White, no sugar, and one for the prisoner.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Can I speak to you off the record?

Suicide is a mortal sin.<eos> Diminished responsibility carries a small hope of salvation.<eos> Are you protecting Mr. Potts or yourself?<eos> I won't have this seminary mired by another scandal.<eos> Last summer's retreat, you chaperoned the students.<eos> The night Douglas Hitchens died...<eos> A tragic accident.<eos> The burden of guilt must weigh heavily.<eos> You've outstayed your welcome, Father Brown.<eos> I'm not sure the rector would agree with you.
The night Douglas Hitchens died...<eos> A tragic accident.<eos> The burden of guilt must weigh heavily.<eos> You've outstayed your welcome, Father Brown.<eos> I'm not sure the rector would agree with you.<eos> Father Palfreyman is indisposed, which means I'm in charge.<eos> If you're not on your bike within the next five minutes, I'll have you escorted from the premises.<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> I've been asked to leave.<eos> I'm tempted to come with you.
~ Mm. ~ That's it.<eos> Just relax.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> We all have pressure points throughout our bodies.<eos> Some dull the senses.<eos> And others arouse them.<eos> I really must go to bed.<eos> I'm afraid the cottage only has one bedroom.<eos> I'll sleep here.<eos> Are you all right?
Yes, it's been cut.<eos> May I get you a drink, Mrs McCarthy?<eos> No.<eos> You may not.<eos> The sooner I am away from this hotel, the better.<eos> Perhaps when we have left here, you would allow me to call on you?<eos> And take you for English tea?<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> It was foolish of me to accept Madame Chania's invitation.<eos> Meeting you has made me realise that.
It's the safest place.<eos> Very good, sir.<eos> You know, after death, it's an instinct to procreate. It's a biological urge.<eos> Dr Barashi.<eos> Do not touch her again.<eos> Why would you care?<eos> I heard you last night in your room, slapping her.<eos> How I discipline her is no concern of yours.<eos> She is my servant.<eos> Are you all right?
Fire!<eos> Fire!<eos> Fire!<eos> ~ Fire.<eos> ~ What?<eos> Fire!<eos> We could have been killed.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you for saving my life!<eos> Are you all right?
What happened?<eos> A leak in the petrol tank.<eos> Didn't you notice when you repaired it?<eos> Someone must have punctured it when I left it outside the hotel.<eos> It looks like the killer doesn't want us to leave, until they're finished with us.<eos> Barashi is behind this!<eos> He hasn't even come out to see what caused the explosion.<eos> ~ That's just how he is.<eos> ~ No.<eos> I'm so pleased you're all right.
But how did the killer know Dr Barashi would choose that pistol?<eos> They didn't.<eos> The killer doesn't care who dies.<eos> So any one of us could be next.<eos> I think until the killer is caught, we should stay together.<eos> Yes.<eos> I wonder who's doing it?<eos> I don't know, but I'm sure it's not the Count.<eos> He seems very gentle.<eos> He's very taken with you.
Syrus does not share his women with anyone!<eos> "The Unholy Virgin".<eos> And "Vixens on Horseback".<eos> And "Hellcats of the Night".<eos> Father.<eos> Syrus.<eos> So what do you think we should do, Father?<eos> Perhaps I should hike up to the road, hitch a lift.<eos> Are you mad?<eos> Out in the open, the killer could pick you off like that.
What?<eos> You changed roles with your maid before the guests arrived.<eos> You're not serious?<eos> Thus relinquishing your hostess duties, you were free to roam the hotel at will, killing when the opportunity arose.<eos> That's absurd.<eos> No doubt you told your maid that the swap was some... hedonistic game.<eos> Father, you said yourself, I was set up.<eos> In retrospect, it seemed too obvious.<eos> You were set up, by yourself.<eos> But you knew that someone was bound to spot the glaring clues you had laid.
You have not been to Mass for months.<eos> Well, I... lose track of the days.<eos> I...<eos> And my Anthony's too busy to drive me.<eos> Hardly surprising, dealing with a saboteur.<eos> Criminals everywhere.<eos> The country's going to the dogs.<eos> If you'll excuse the pun.<eos> Well, your son is a colonel.<eos> He'll look after you.
Yes.<eos> But why didn't you tell the truth straightaway?<eos> Nobody would have blamed you.<eos> It was self-defence.<eos> I wanted that impostor to take the blame.<eos> He lied to me!<eos> And he should hang for that?<eos> - Shouldn't he?<eos> - When you think about it, Sergeant Hawkins has dedicated his life to fulfilling your son's dying wish.<eos> He built up his vineyard, he looking after you.
Well, the Belvedere is fully equipped with a foolproof alarm system.<eos> All the exhibits are perfectly safe.<eos> I'll be allocating PC Nyland to keep an eye on things.<eos> Just to put our minds at rest.<eos> I'm never going to open on time, at this rate.<eos> Perhaps I should leave you to it.<eos> Yes, perhaps you should.<eos> I have an appointment.<eos> Pictura Magazine.<eos> Now, there's the journalist who's come to interview me, so I shall see you both at tomorrow's preview.
Perhaps I should leave you to it.<eos> Yes, perhaps you should.<eos> I have an appointment.<eos> Pictura Magazine.<eos> Now, there's the journalist who's come to interview me, so I shall see you both at tomorrow's preview.<eos> - Sir.<eos> - It promises to be exclusive.<eos> Binkie Cadwaller.<eos> - Museum curator.<eos> - I've been looking forward to meeting you.
I expect he'll try and pick it up, with me indisposed.<eos> Then we'll make sure we're waiting for him.<eos> In the meantime, there's a cell in this station with your name on it.<eos> I want to talk to my solicitor.<eos> Sergeant, get on to Cheltenham.<eos> All available units to the railway station.<eos> - Inspector...<eos> - I'll meet them there.<eos> Any news on Flambeau's whereabouts?<eos> None that I'll be sharing with you.
I know, I know.<eos> Tess, you got to get JT as far away from Alton as possible.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna try and save both of them.<eos> Go!<eos> Hurry!<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Stop!<eos> You're gonna kill each other, is that what you want?<eos> Listen to me-- you have the power to fight whoever turned you into this, both of you do, but not if you kill each other.
You want to give me 300,000 gold deniers?<eos> To go shopping?<eos> Please?<eos> Where is your heir?<eos> I had a feeling.<eos> It's a bit complicated.<eos> By the fact that Francis no longer visits your chambers?<eos> Is that your decision or his?<eos> It's ours.<eos> Or has Lola come between you two?
Your brother James is under pressure.<eos> The Protestant lords want you gone.<eos> They want to make Scotland a protectorate of England.<eos> But he insists that you are the lawful queen.<eos> A stand that protects his hold on power as well.<eos> You are on the cusp of losing your country.<eos> Either you or Elizabeth will rule<eos> Scotland and England.<eos> Make an heir, and it will be you.<eos> Why didn't you tell your mother what happened to you?
Lola.<eos> How nice to see you.<eos> Oh, Louis!<eos> My son might get engaged before he can walk.<eos> Isn't that wonderful? (laughs)<eos> I...<eos> I suppose.<eos> Be happy for me, won't you?<eos> Lola, I have to ask...<eos> Are you all right?
Oh, but I am.<eos> Have her servants escort her to her chambers and stay with her through the night.<eos> No stops along the way.<eos> Yes, Your Majesty.<eos> You're early.<eos> Wasn't expecting anybody to return for a few more hours.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> I saw Francis at the party after Lola said he wouldn't be attending.<eos> That he'd be with you.
Francis knows of our feelings and has forbidden our union.<eos> "Our feelings"?<eos> Are you saying that... ?<eos> That I care for you, of course I do.<eos> You know I do.<eos> Why else would your declaration frighten me so?<eos> I can promise you nothing, given who I am and what I've been through.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I understand.<eos> Was Francis harsh with you?
I do...<eos> I want a good life, and a husband to share it with.<eos> And I'm sick of being judged for it just because you want less.<eos> Less comfort.<eos> Less responsibility.<eos> Less of me.<eos> You.<eos> How have I offended you now?<eos> One question.<eos> Could sex with you be simple?
He's from nowhere.<eos> I'm helping him.<eos> Éva, call the home to tell them where he is.<eos> There! It's started!<eos> - Shall I put him to bed?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Lucciana Agostini psychoanalyst<eos> - Hello.<eos> - You don't have an appointment.<eos> I know. But I must talk to you.
What is that supposed to mean?<eos> We made out pretty hardcore.<eos> Was there any biting involved?<eos> Uh...<eos> I guess.<eos> I mean, I-I like to bite the lower lip a little bit, but I-I th... I think it's kind of weird you're asking me these questions.<eos> No.<eos> I meant, did she bite you?<eos> Not that I remember.<eos> Are... are you into her or something?
Thank you for keeping us safe.<eos> I'm just doing my job.<eos> Which I should get to, it being our first day back.<eos> So thank you.<eos> Oh, Officer Porter!<eos> Care to say a few words?<eos> Hey, you still ducking the cameras?<eos> Not everyone needs the attention.<eos> Hunter, Porter, need to see you in the bullpen.<eos> This department owes you a debt of gratitude, which is why tomorrow, the mayor is presenting you with medals of honor.
No, of course not.<eos> Please, you keep it.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, why don't you ask the hostess to squeeze you in between Karenna and Celia?<eos> And if you don't mind, would you also ask her to send over an ounce of hackleback?<eos> Well, that's caviar, dear.<eos> Now, I'm sure that we could all agree that anyone who would suggest that my fundraiser is unseemly is no friend of ours and undeserving of our time.<eos> Don't you think?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Well, then I look forward to seeing you all tonight.
You'll get your funding, son. Trust me.<eos> This is gonna be a runaway bride of biblical proportions.<eos> Officers Ben Hunter and Jack Porter, for brave actions in the line of duty, we salute you.<eos> How does it feel to be a local hero, Officer Porter?<eos> Ask my partner.<eos> I was just sitting shotgun to the best cop in town.<eos> See?<eos> Was that so hard, Porter?<eos> Well, the hard part's next.<eos> I need to talk to you after the ceremony.
- But I have a minute right now.<eos> You want to go take a walk in the park?<eos> Oh, a walk in the park.<eos> How romantic.<eos> And I know where all the murder spots are. Oh.<eos> Do you want to see them or avoid them?<eos> The choice is yours, m'lady.<eos> Terry, don't wait up.<eos> - It's 10:00 A.M. - Yep.<eos> Deputy Chief Wuntch is here to see you.
Shh shh shh shh shh shh shh. Oh.<eos> Moment savored.<eos> So, where were we?<eos> Ah yes, you were talking about how I hold your fate in the palm of my hand.<eos> (Gina) Oopsie. [gasps]<eos> (Amy) Oh my God. Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> I lost my balance.<eos> You think I'm bothered by a little spilled milkshake?<eos> I'm a food blogger, I'm stained all over.<eos> Okay, what is going on with you two?
Connie.<eos> It's 1:00 in the morning.<eos> Tony, please can we not?<eos> Have you been drinking?<eos> Yeah, yeah. There was some wine.<eos> We watched a movie.<eos> We watched Bride of Frankenstein.<eos> But you... Your phone was off.<eos> We were expecting you by 9:30, 10:00.<eos> What's going on with you guys?
I'm not touching you.<eos> Stop it.<eos> I'm not touching you.<eos> No, stop.<eos> (Aisha) Hey, your mother is in the house.<eos> I decree this ruckus shall cease.<eos> Ugh, monster children.<eos> You made me lose.<eos> Come on, go wash up. Go upstairs.<eos> And I'll come and discuss the day with you two.
Or is this my lucky day?<eos> Both.<eos> (Male narrator) After six fruitless but exciting years in New York, chasing careers in modeling, publishing, fashion photography, and a dalliance with jewelry making,<eos> Rosie had finally found what she was looking for: A great man, a man who would love her, support her, and provide for her in manner about which she had always dreamt.<eos> (Gary) All right. Come on, guys.<eos> He can't be late, Rosie.<eos> It's his first day.<eos> Are you excited to go to school?<eos> Yes, but are you staying with me?<eos> (Gary) Yeah, we will for a little while just to make sure you're okay, but your mommy has an appointment, and I'm gonna be around the corner drawing, 'cause it's forbidden for parents to see what they're gonna do to you in there.
And you do realize this is not the band.<eos> Motherboy was also a heavy metal band...<eos> That used to rock pretty hard in the '70s.<eos> We are legally obligated to make the distinction.<eos> Maybe I should let my dad know that we're here.<eos> Oh, he'll know when we bring home the trophy.<eos> Yeah, but maybe I'll just give him a call.<eos> And what name shall we put the room under?<eos> - And Lindsay was about to see... a Tobias with the raw power of George Sr.<eos> I sort of want to talk to you about some things.
Forgive me.<eos> Long hours, giddy at the smell of the barn.<eos> Stoic composure.<eos> The next sound you hear will be that of your own voice.<eos> Get the fuck out of here.<eos> You'll know when I've come to an answer.<eos> I must tell you I require a response within the hour.<eos> Or as soon as humanly possible.<eos> Clam on a half shell looking goddamned fool!<eos> I'm embarrassed to say I know you!
Go ahead and take that to him, Captain.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Bless you.<eos> Bless you.<eos> Bless you.<eos> Bless you.<eos> I'm in the day's fucking talents, Tom.<eos> There's talk of an offer on my place.<eos> - How will you answer?<eos> - I came to take counsel with you.
- Cocksucker!<eos> It's wasted on me, Wu.<eos> Cocksucker! Cocksucker!<eos> I don't get it, Wu.<eos> I am not as smart as Al.<eos> And there's too much on our fucking plate right now to deal with it.<eos> - Cocksucker!<eos> San Francisco.<eos> - Jesus fucking Christ!<eos> All right, there's an invisible cocksucker next to you... and he's from San Francisco.
It was, for you, just a one-night thing<eos> But you were much more to me Just so you know<eos> I don't care what they say<eos> I know what you meant For me that day<eos> I just want another try<eos> I just want another night<eos> Even if it doesn't seem quite right<eos> You meant, for me, much more<eos> Than anyone I've met before<eos> One single night with you, little Jesse
His name is Konig, Major Konig.<eos> They've sent him here to ki... to find you.<eos> At first we weren't sure if the information was reliable.<eos> It seems he's come all the way from Berlin to stop you.<eos> You've caused them so many sleepless nights, they sent their top marksman.<eos> -What do we know about him?<eos> He's director of their sniper school in Zossen.<eos> Koulikov studied under him at Zossen before the war.<eos> He knows all his tricks.<eos> From now on, he'll go with you everywhere.
But agree with your taking this boy as your Padawan learner... I do not.<eos> Qui-Gon believed in him.<eos> The chosen one the boy may be.<eos> Nevertheless... grave danger I fear in his training.<eos> Master Yoda, I gave Qui-Gon my word.<eos> I will train Anakin.<eos> Without the approval of the council, if I must.<eos> Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you.<eos> Need that you do not.<eos> Agree with you the council does.
So we cancel the show?<eos> I'd like to speak to Huma, please.<eos> Yes, wait outside.<eos> Five minutes.<eos> All right!<eos> - She's bombed.<eos> She can't even speak.<eos> She went out after you did.<eos> She didn't know I'd drop by.<eos> She thought I'd be with you.
- Hey.<eos> - Sit down.<eos> Have a drink.<eos> We really wanted to contact you, but we couldn't.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I'm the one who should be sorry for not calling you.<eos> This guy's the head of our friendship association now.<eos> - Bongwoo club.<eos> - Right, Bongwoo club.<eos> I am really sorry for not contacting you.
Have a seat.<eos> Apologies for such shabby hospitality.<eos> It was a difficultjob tracking you down.<eos> Last night, the rain fell on my forehead, as I lay in bed.<eos> You, sit down!<eos> Fucker!<eos> This isn't a game, sit!<eos> Isn't the way I live pathetic?<eos> Wonder why I live this way?<eos> Although I don't know who sent you, I want to talk with you.
Yun Sunim.<eos> She came to see you.<eos> Who is she?<eos> A girlfriend?<eos> I'm back in my hometown.<eos> How did you find me?<eos> Home...<eos> I went to your folks'.<eos> Why?<eos> To get in touch with you.
Moses!<eos> - Moses!<eos> - Let me go!<eos> - No, wait.<eos> - You saw what happened.<eos> I ust killed a man.<eos> We can take care of that.<eos> I will make it so it never happened. Nothing you can say can change what I've done.<eos> I am Egypt, the morning and the evening star.<eos> If I say day is night, it will be written, and you will be what I say you are.
See you later.<eos> - Shall I talk to Johan?<eos> - No!<eos> Don't be shy now.<eos> - Yeah, I pump iron every day.<eos> - How much?<eos> 98 kg.<eos> Can I talk to you?<eos> Elin's sitting over there...<eos> I think she wants to talk to you.
- I just wanted to say...<eos> I think you're really nice and things, but...<eos> It's just that I'm...<eos> I'm in love with someone else...<eos> Who is it?<eos> Where're you going?<eos> - Stop it!<eos> What are you doing!<eos> - I must talk to you.<eos> I must talk to you...
I must talk to you...<eos> It's really important.<eos> Please, please.<eos> I'm just going to say one thing. Please!<eos> What do you want to say?<eos> I was the one that threw the stone.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to break it.<eos> I wanted...<eos> I wanted to talk to you.
I don't know who you are... ..but you are addressing a superior officer!<eos> There were three of you, that's what you said.<eos> "What the three of us did to that poor girl."<eos> You and Henry Reed. Who else?<eos> Show some respect!<eos> Tell me what you know about the girls in this photo.<eos> I said, get out!<eos> Stand down, soldier!<eos> Henry Reed. 1991.<eos> Who was with you?
Mr Webster, will you be at the court?<eos> Hi. Hey.<eos> You think they're going to be there all the way through the trial, - watching us? - Oh, God knows.<eos> I spoke to Matthew.<eos> - We're going to go for a pint later. Like we used to, so...<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> And I've been thinking about scaling back at work.<eos> You know, give us more time.<eos> Are you listening?<eos> What's going on with you? Oh...
I won't get my pension unless I wait.<eos> This is what you wanted.<eos> To see the stars again.<eos> Isn't that what you always said you wanted?<eos> But I don't know why Lucy can't come with me.<eos> Don't... Don't you trust me?<eos> You earn my trust when I say you have.<eos> You know that.<eos> Take this.<eos> Then you can have us there with you.
But... they copied all of his computer discs, so hopefully they're there.<eos> You think he'll tell Young-Hee?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> But it's hard to really know.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - This is Mrs. Hathaway.<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> I have a message for you.<eos> Patty, it's me.<eos> I need to talk to you.
- This is Mrs. Hathaway.<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> I have a message for you.<eos> Patty, it's me.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Where did you go?<eos> Why you don't call me?<eos> Something is not right about Don.<eos> He's acting so...<eos> I need to talk to you.
- The usual, Waves.<eos> - Pete...<eos> The usual, please.<eos> That states the buyer's intentions, which could include anything<eos> - from rebuilding or remodeling...<eos> - They want to tear it down?<eos> There you go.<eos> I heard about you and Champ, by the way.<eos> He never treated you right, Waverly.<eos> I was thinking, you know, any man in Purgatory would be lucky to have you.
Who we want.<eos> You've always been an honest kid.<eos> Don't stop now.<eos> Hey.<eos> I got a message for Wynonna Earp.<eos> She's not here.<eos> I can wait.<eos> Doc.<eos> - Sorry, no speak evil.<eos> - I wasn't talking to you.
What?<eos> To parachute out of a plane at fifteen thousand feet.<eos> Yeah.<eos> To swim far, far out into the ocean so that I can't see the bottom anymore.<eos> To eat geoduck.<eos> Isn't it the one that kinda looks like a p...<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> Point is, I've always wanted to do things that scared me.<eos> But, well, it's not so easy to be brazen when the thing that you want, that scares you to death,<eos> is sitting right in front of you.
What's this?<eos> Dry cleaning.<eos> Address is on the card.<eos> Edwards!<eos> Morning.<eos> Uh, Pit's called for a consult.<eos> I rounded on all of your post-ops.<eos> Four aneurysm repairs, all doing fine.<eos> Mr. Klein is awake and responsive.<eos> What's the matter with you?
Thought that you wanted to know.<eos> I asked.<eos> Scans are ready.<eos> I rounded on your post-ops, got your labs back, filed the intern applications, and picked up your dry cleaning.<eos> They got the stain out of your purple sweater.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Yeah, so, you were right about the appendicitis.<eos> Mm. All right, DeLuca, you can go get my surgery transcriptions.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Hey, what's wrong with you?
And, um...<eos> You know, but I heard what you said.<eos> I had too much on my plate.<eos> And, um...<eos> But things are going well for me now.<eos> I stopped drinking.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, I heard. I heard.<eos> - Did you?<eos> Yeah, that's good, man. I'm...<eos> - I'm proud of you, man.
We go back.<eos> Forward.<eos> Back.<eos> Come on.<eos> Fine.<eos> Manny.<eos> It's Ellie, she's trapped in a cave.<eos> Ellie, I don't want us to be together because we have to.<eos> I want us to be together because we want to.<eos> And I wanna be with you, Ellie.
It's good to have you back, Sid.<eos> Never thought I would say this, but I missed you, buddy.<eos> All right, mammals, let's get you home.<eos> That's right, sweetheart.<eos> Welcome to the ice age.<eos> What was that?<eos> I think we're almost there!<eos> I'll bury you all and dance on your graves.<eos> So frail.<eos> And she can't wait to spend time with you, Sid.
Burn!<eos> We're the same species, genius.<eos> What?<eos> Double burn.<eos> Is that...?<eos> Peaches?<eos> There she is!<eos> Dad!<eos> Go, go, I'm right behind you. No!<eos> I'm right behind you.
I repeat, officer down!<eos> - [SCREAMING CONTINUES] - [CAMERAS FLASHING]<eos> - [PEOPLE CLAMORING] - [OFFICERS SHOUTING]<eos> [BELL RINGING]<eos> Justin, this is Detective Diamond.<eos> My mom... she got hurt?<eos> [EXHALES]<eos> Were you and my mom friends?<eos> We were.<eos> She bragged about you constantly, how proud she was of you.
Justin, this is Detective Diamond.<eos> My mom... she got hurt?<eos> [EXHALES]<eos> Were you and my mom friends?<eos> We were.<eos> She bragged about you constantly, how proud she was of you.<eos> [SOBBING] Moms have to say that.<eos> They don't, believe me.<eos> She meant it.<eos> Justin, is there someone that can come and stay with you?
How are you?<eos> Ugh, I'm fine. I'm fine.<eos> Laura, they tried to kill you.<eos> - Our Captain died in your arms and you had to tell her son.<eos> I'm gonna ask you again.<eos> How are you?<eos> I'm devastated, exhausted, numb.<eos> This is one of the worst days of my life and I just feel really low.<eos> You're not alone.<eos> We're all here with you.
They didn't know.<eos> Didn't know what?<eos> That Rayna had stabbed Stefan.<eos> That his spirit was already trapped in the Phoenix Stone.<eos> They probably thought they were doing the world a favor.<eos> Well, that's awfully generous.<eos> Of you, not of them, considering they never gave a damn about anyone else other than each other.<eos> So if you're done mourning Thelma and Mary Louise,<eos> I think we should get out of here.<eos> I'm not going anywhere with you.
What is this supposed to prove?<eos> That you were under the influence when you were driving the bus.<eos> What did you say?<eos> When you destroyed the Phoenix Stone, all the souls inside escaped.<eos> Scattered.<eos> And I can hear them.<eos> Alive.<eos> Every one of them.<eos> You're saying that every vampire you ever killed with that sword is now wandering the Earth?<eos> What the hell happened to you?
Rayna shot a stake through her rib cage,<eos> Matt.<eos> Listen to me, we were out.<eos> Three years, three years, no stabbings, no hostage swaps, no supernatural threat breathing down our neck, okay?<eos> We are getting married in a month.<eos> We have got kids that we need to take care of.<eos> Look, Caroline was bait.<eos> To draw Stefan out.<eos> That's all.<eos> What the hell happened to you, man?
Since when do you have friends besides me?<eos> We made new ones.<eos> Look, I know this has been just a catnap for you, Damon, but it's been three years in the real world. People change. Life goes on.<eos> I made an excruciatingly painful descent into a near-death state so I wouldn't destroy everyone that I loved.<eos> You know what?<eos> Now that we know where Ambrose is all camped out,<eos> I think I'm gonna get back to my life now.<eos> So if you don't mind taking me to the airport or a train station or... even this bus stop pulling up here, yeah, if you want to pull over... And there it goes.<eos> Look, I get you're mad. Okay?<eos> I shouldn't have said good-bye in a letter. I should've flown to Dallas and taken you out for drinks and line dancing and told you face-to-face.
- Alright.<eos> - No, Mummy.<eos> Ma'am, His Majesty has requested you attend him in his study.<eos> Urgently requested, ma'am.<eos> Alright.<eos> Will you take them?<eos> I'll be back soon.<eos> Off we go then!<eos> In case you're wondering, I haven't anything specific to say.<eos> Just wanted to spend time with you.
Helicopters aren't coming out in the storm and the ambulance says it will be several hours.<eos> The roads have all flooded, apparently, all over.<eos> This is useless.<eos> He's got an open fracture -- I'm going to need to splint.<eos> What about Bill?<eos> Maybe he has some vet supplies at the farm.<eos> That'd work.<eos> Rob, get over there, grab everything you can.<eos> Wait.<eos> Do you need me to come with you?
Is he...?<eos> Is he badly hurt?<eos> We don't know right now.<eos> we've called an ambulance, but God knows when it's going to get here.<eos> Claire needs some medical things -- she thought you might have some for the animals.<eos> Of course I do.<eos> In the calves' barn.<eos> I'll show you where it is.<eos> - Yeah, I know where it is, Bill.<eos> - Hold on, I'll come with you.
Okay.<eos> Okay, so this is like a role-play thing.<eos> For me it is.<eos> You're playing yourself.<eos> Okay, I'm your main motivator.<eos> Okay?<eos> I advise you on contracts.<eos> - Schedule training. Coordinate leisure activities.<eos> Just last week I massaged that fucking groin muscle you tweaked.<eos> And I provide a buffer between you and that slippery bald white guy that always carrying Spencer's jockstrap.
What if he knows something? - Of what?<eos> - Your dealings with Trencrom!<eos> The more he comes calling...<eos> The more likely he is to sniff something out.<eos> And you cannot now offer discouragement without arousing suspicions as to why!<eos> So I'm to blame?<eos> You missed a treat.<eos> George Warleggan graced us with his presence.<eos> What did he want?<eos> To be reconciled with you.
But if you do, then you've no cause to keep askin' for proof.<eos> And do you...believe?<eos> Most o' the time.<eos> Why don't you smile, Mama?<eos> Well, smiling makes lines upon the face, my love.<eos> See?<eos> And lines make us look older.<eos> So I must smile less.<eos> Not in public, but here, at home.<eos> But when you see me not smiling, you mustn't think I'm sad or displeased with you, only that I'm trying to spare my face.
This will enormously ease your situation.<eos> I'm only grateful for your hesitation, and your loyalty all these months.<eos> Loyalty's not all on one side, Ross, nor ever has been.<eos> I regret I must decline your invitation for Christmas.<eos> I believe Francis would want me to spend it in his house.<eos> And I regret that circumstances are such that I cannot take care of you as I might wish.<eos> We both regret that, Ross.<eos> You've had time to consider your position?<eos> I have.<eos> See, Caroline, you must understand that though I might tolerate the young man on a professional basis, I cannot permit him to have sight of you again after his impudent pretensions to your hand.
I suspect it won't be long before we see a Mistress George Warleggan.<eos> Odds on it's the Penrose girl.<eos> He wouldn't be satisfied with anything less than an honourable...<eos> Nor should he be.<eos> I've discussed it with Pascoe.<eos> We wait until late in the day to tell Cary I cannot pay him.<eos> Then there's a chance they won't come and arrest me till tomorrow.<eos> So we shall have one final night at home together.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> With you.
Could it be Charlie?<eos> You must keep to your plan...<eos> No.<eos> I can go to Charlie and still have time to get to Killewarren.<eos> What will you do?<eos> In the first place, confirm our suspicions.<eos> We may be mistaken.<eos> But the drop's tonight.<eos> What if there's an ambush?<eos> I'll come with you.
Really, I'm fine.<eos> How many sad songs have you written this week?<eos> I lost count.<eos> But it's a good thing.<eos> I mean, I release my emotional demons through song.<eos> And what about exorcising those demons in front of a live audience.<eos> - What?<eos> Here?<eos> - Come on.<eos> I'll go up there with you.
Holding in those feelings can be toxic.<eos> Ugh, Leila's early.<eos> Lisbeth, go see who it is!<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay. Why does she keep doing that?<eos> So this is the big fight scene.<eos> After some heated exchange, I'll step in as peacemaker, teaching my followers a valuable lesson in diplomacy.<eos> Lauren.<eos> Hi, I'm Raven.<eos> It's so nice to finally meet you.
Why would she do that?<eos> Because I told her that she would never have a connection with Amy the way that I do, and she's trying to prove me wrong.<eos> She's a psychopath.<eos> Do you hear how crazy you sound?<eos> That kiss looked pretty real to me.<eos> At least help me warn her.<eos> I mean, who knows what lies Sabrina's telling her to suck her deeper into her web?<eos> The thing is, is I don't think Sabrina's faking it.<eos> Sorry, Karma, you're on your own.<eos> I've got to talk to you about Sabrina.
Call me Haitham.<eos> When we're not in class.<eos> Of course.<eos> Not only as first lady, but also as a physician.<eos> You were great.<eos> Really relaxed, authoritative, very first lady-ish.<eos> It's not really my thing, being on TV, but thank you.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> He doesn't even look that much older than me.<eos> Can I come with you?
Bust it.<eos> It's clear.<eos> That's outside NCIS.<eos> My bar.<eos> Laurel's apartment.<eos> No question about it.<eos> Whoever owns this van... they're after me.<eos> We found these outside NCIS, the morgue, the bar, and other places you frequent.<eos> Including Laurel's apartment.<eos> Someone is after you.
Your whole life... I've taken it as a badge of honor that I could shield you from the worst... that I do.<eos> What happened today... is not gonna happen again.<eos> What happened today is that I killed someone.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> I hit him.<eos> He died.<eos> It doesn't happen like that, baby girl.<eos> Then how does it happen, Dad?<eos> Look... let's see what Loretta says after her autopsy.<eos> But either way... you protected yourself and I'm proud of you.
A safe house.<eos> Your bags are in the car.<eos> We're gonna take you out through the back exit.<eos> You coming, too?<eos> I'm staying.<eos> I got to make this right.<eos> I saw all those people who hate you.<eos> You need protection, too.<eos> But they didn't come after me.<eos> They went after you.
And you may be right.<eos> Emily may have been murdered.<eos> But we know Warrant Officer Babish was.<eos> I'm gonna pay a visit to The Globe.<eos> That's where Babish worked.<eos> That's where we'll learn things about him.<eos> In the meantime, you all stay here.<eos> Track anything that Babish might've been up to here in town.<eos> Pride.<eos> If there is any connection to Emily, I will not be able to spot it from here-- can I come with you?
I promise.<eos> Okay.<eos> Get your stuff.<eos> Doing all right?<eos> Yeah, I'm good.<eos> Brody?<eos> Answers you want-- I've seen a lot of grieving people chase the same thing.<eos> And they chase it... right down the rabbit hole.<eos> That's a dark place to be.<eos> I don't want that to happen to you.
And we could've.<eos> All you had to do was ask.<eos> So, what do you got, Miss Loretta?<eos> Wait, wait, hold on.<eos> I was respecting Merri's wishes.<eos> Are you guys, like, mad at me?<eos> No, dear, we're simply concerned.<eos> Meredith is in a very sensitive position.<eos> She's not in her clearest state of mind.<eos> Yeah, especially with you in her ear.
Easy.<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Easy, hands out.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Edward Lamb.<eos> He's the one who killed my sister.<eos> Percy, you see this now, don't you?<eos> Emily and Babish's cases have to be connected.<eos> Lamb killed my sister, then he hacked into the laptop that Babish stole-- now, what else could that mean?<eos> Yeah, I don't disagree with you.
No stew?<eos> I'm sure the recipe is in one of my boxes.<eos> How you doing?<eos> So, we got to the truth of it all, but... I still feel this... hole in my heart... and it's... it's just as big as it was before.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You just got to take it one day at a time.<eos> One box at a time.<eos> It's okay to start living your life again.<eos> You got the strength.<eos> And I'm proud of you.
And you got yourself a deal.<eos> I texted my higher-ups at Quantico, and they agreed to release you tonight, for 24 hours, when Halloween officially begins.<eos> - You will wear this anklet. - (BEEPS)<eos> That way, they'll know if you leave the hospital grounds.<eos> Now, at the stroke of midnight, after I've had a few cocktails, danced a little bit, and made out with a couple guys, you will tell us who the killer is.<eos> You will not tell anybody about this arrangement, because if you do, you will be sent back to the asylum like that.<eos> You will wear this costume, and you will keep this mask on at all times.<eos> - Is this a Jason costume?<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> With you in this costume, it'll be easy to keep a eye on you, 'cause nobody wants to be Jason on Halloween.
Nuh-uh!<eos> Maybe on Friday the 13th.<eos> If anything, people want to go as Michael Myers.<eos> I've never seen Halloween.<eos> Me neither.<eos> But I know Mike Myers played the bad guy.<eos> It was, like, the movie he did right after Wayne's World.<eos> Anyway, here's the axe to go with your costume.<eos> And remember:<eos> I gots my eye on you.
He told me you might say that.<eos> Wha...<eos> He wants to help us.<eos> No, you have to trust me, Clenna.<eos> Everything Benton said is a lie.<eos> We have to go!<eos> Stop, stop!<eos> Last time I followed you, Michael, my brother ended up dead... and I ended up in prison, and then on a horrible ship, in chains for weeks, freezing cold and starving and surrounded by filthy men<eos> with their rotting teeth and their stinking breath and all so I could end up here in this horrible frigid place!<eos> So no... I don't think I will follow you this time!
Benton's been feeding her lies.<eos> Do not shoot! Go, Michael!<eos> Are you with us?<eos> I am.<eos> Good.<eos> It's not safe here.<eos> Let's make camp outside of town.<eos> Let's go!<eos> - Soldiers coming.<eos> - They followed you!
Previously on "Frontier"...<eos> Sir, we've spotted a sail on the horizon.<eos> His name is Johnson.<eos> Come out of nowhere with a stick up his ass.<eos> Give me access to company ledgers... that means now.<eos> - Shh. Shh. - Michael, is that you?<eos> !<eos> I thought of you everyday, Clenna.<eos> - Soldiers are coming!<eos> - They followed you!
He can't be far.<eos> Find him.<eos> Every building, every alley!<eos> I want every corner searched until Michael Smyth is found!<eos> Sit tight and stay quiet.<eos> You'll be safe here.<eos> You're bleedin'.<eos> Let me see.<eos> This is your fault!<eos> The Redcoats followed you.
Perhaps I shall hang you fourteen times.<eos> You turned your back on me, Declan.<eos> You betrayed me.<eos> And you will admit this.<eos> You will show me respect and you will beg my forgiveness.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> I just couldn't bear the thought of Clenna in that house with Benton.<eos> You should have known they would follow.<eos> I thought I was being careful.<eos> You double back, you see if they're behind you!
And please join me tonight for dinner.<eos> We can discuss the future.<eos> If any of you know the whereabouts of Michael Smyth,<eos> - I have a message!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> If he wants his girl to live, he will turn himself in!<eos> If you do not wish your secrets to be aired aloud, you will let her go.<eos> You will mind your business, Grace!<eos> I mean it, Chesterfield.<eos> What is the matter with you?
I have to do this myself.<eos> You don't!<eos> We can't all die...<eos> None of us has to die!<eos> He has taken them from us.<eos> You don't know.<eos> He said things and did things, That I can't get out of my head.<eos> I have to end him, For her, nuna, For my boy, for us.<eos> She wouldn't want this.<eos> Declan, I abandoned everything to follow you.
Thorne, we will wait for the fly together.<eos> And don't worry.<eos> I've seen a tipsy man before tonight.<eos> You should get started.<eos> The train will be in at three o'clock.<eos> Take Beatrice with you.<eos> How can Aunt De Courcy help?<eos> Frank's mind is made up.<eos> He won't be talked out of her now.<eos> I agree with you.
If she doesn't think that we should apply for this patent, she's being patently absurd.<eos> Good one.<eos> Okay, you got it.<eos> See, I was afraid it was a thinker.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I just want to make sure you've thought this through.<eos> What's to think about?<eos> We have an invention and want to move forward.<eos> Howie, you're about to form a legal partnership with Sheldon Cooper.<eos> All right, if you're gonna calmly make excellent points, then I don't know if I want to talk to you.
It's fine.<eos> I think that everyone should do whatever they feel... ..what feels right for them.<eos> We're still soulmates, Danny.<eos> And the results for heat 3 of the boys 17-18 100-metre butterfly final.<eos> In first place, in lane 8, we have Daniel Kelly, swimming a national qualifying time... 56.09.<eos> That means you're in.<eos> You still have to work on your palm rotation and recovery.<eos> Still too much drag.<eos> Good swim.<eos> Very proud of you.
- Perfect.<eos> - We got matching bridesmaids dresses.<eos> Well, anyway...<eos> Love you, Lay.<eos> You too, Nay-Nay! Oh! Bye.<eos> What was that?<eos> The F-word?<eos> You two pussy pals now?<eos> Shut up.<eos> - She was always mean to you.
- Have you seen my charger?<eos> - ...only pretend to be happy.<eos> I said don't borrow this!<eos> High fours like Naomi, I bet they're suicidal on the inside.<eos> My car is here.<eos> Again.<eos> Your Pelican Cove deposit, is it refundable?<eos> Like, what if this doesn't work?<eos> - Can't you just stay out of my shit?<eos> - You're my sister! And if you cared about that, maybe you would've noticed living with you hasn't been one big rainbow sandwich for me.
Where are you headed?<eos> Uh... Just as close as you can get to Port Mary would be great.<eos> Checking my feed for danger signs?<eos> I get it a lot. 1.4 gotta be an antisocial maniac, right?<eos> - You seem...<eos> - Normal?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> It took some effort.<eos> What happened to you?
She seemed to enjoy that.<eos> Guys and me never worked out.<eos> They'd see Naomi and just... Whoo! You know, that was it.<eos> She had this tight ass, like two fists.<eos> Uh-huh. I was all like...<eos> I was like... through the hallways in high school.<eos> And she was there for me.<eos> Holding my hair back... as I knelt, vomiting, in front of the crapper.<eos> Thank you for that, Naomi.<eos> I always wished I was you.
I don't understand. You seem happy about that.<eos> That's because one of my favorite pastimes is to listen to one of Louis's messages.<eos> What if he's upset about something?<eos> He's always upset about something.<eos> That's why one of my favorite pastimes is to listen to one of Louis's messages.<eos> Damn it, Harvey, pick up the goddamn phone, because this entire firm is a ghost town, and I'm sorry Mike's in prison, but if we don't figure something out, what you and your little sidekick did<eos> And don't give me some bullshit about tonight isn't the time, because...<eos> I got to go.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I'm coming with you.
She...<eos> I need 15 minutes to myself.<eos> And that's it.<eos> I cut a deal, and now I'm here.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> If you're a fake lawyer, they had to give you a chance to turn on someone to get out of it.<eos> They did.<eos> So why the hell didn't you do it?<eos> Because I wouldn't have been able to live with myself.<eos> Somebody out there owes you a lot.
That is a level of defiance the corporations just can't accept.<eos> And even your allies, and I'm sure you have some, are going to have to back off.<eos> Now if you still think this is business as usual, you're dead wrong.<eos> Well, I'll take that under advisement.<eos> Hey, how's that robot?<eos> She shut down to self-repair.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> I just thought it might be nice if someone checked in on her once in a while.<eos> Knock yourself out.<eos> What's with you?
Ain't nothing complicated about it.<eos> As long as he's on this ship, you're all asking for a world of hurt.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Did you get a chance to finish that sketch?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You did a really great job on this.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Something really bad happened to you there.
- Don't be late.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, looks like we got everything we need.<eos> Ready to head back to the ship?<eos> I'd like to stay a while.<eos> Explore the station.<eos> Rejoin you later if that's all right.<eos> Um, okay.<eos> You can stay too, if you want.<eos> No, I'll come back with you.
But remember, the truth is...<eos> I could've killed you, and I didn't.<eos> When I saw you cowering in that closet, something changed.<eos> It was like all of a sudden my life had a purpose.<eos> I had someone to protect, someone to take care of.<eos> So you raised me to be a thieving bastard, just like yourself.<eos> I taught you how to protect yourself.<eos> I taught you to survive.<eos> Now, I understand your anger but if the truth be told, all those years growing, you knew.<eos> You knew and you forgave me, because I looked out for you.
You've made that very clear to us, and also that you don't use drugs.<eos> He doesn't.<eos> Test him.<eos> But the girls he had sex with used drugs.<eos> Okay, so, some of the girls used drugs.<eos> How is that my problem?<eos> - Oh, my God. - "Oh, my God" is right.<eos> What?<eos> What is it?<eos> If you knew the girls were high, they couldn't give their consent for sex with you, asshole.
You're not making enough money right now To just be taking taxis all around town.<eos> Right, but this is when you could see me, And i didn't want to say this over the phone. Say what?<eos> I contacted gary's parents, And it turns out that they're really nice people.<eos> their other son is a doctor. Isn't that funny?<eos> I knew i couldn't give my baby to complete strangers, But gary's parents will take the child.<eos> I thought about what you said, And the baby will grow up without any worries. And then you and i will be okay, right?<eos> We'll be okay?<eos> Y--<eos> Mom, um, yeah, we'll be -- we'll be okay.<eos> Look, why -- why don't -- why don't i-i go down with you And i-i could pay off your taxi?
Life?<eos> Your phone has been ringing.<eos> I'm throwing it away.<eos> What?<eos> I need to tell you something.<eos> You killed a man in Reno.<eos> Yeah...<eos> - Lucca told you?<eos> - Hey, we all make mistakes.<eos> So... I don't want you to get worried about this because it has nothing to do with you.
So, that's a bad preamble.<eos> I should have just said it.<eos> Now you're all braced.<eos> Here... unbrace yourself.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, we'll talk later, this was stupid.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> What, Alicia?<eos> I'm getting divorced.<eos> Okay, I shouldn't have said anything because it has nothing to do with you.
Turns out I have a policy of my own.<eos> Allow me to introduce it to you.<eos> Aah! Aah!<eos> Hey, no. No, no! No!<eos> Oh! Aah!<eos> So, all the victims' driver's licenses match up with their name tags, and they all had car keys in their pockets.<eos> Dead less than an hour.<eos> - I'll be right back. - Flynn:<eos> You heading out?<eos> - Yeah. - I'll go with you.
Look, Andy, I'm a doctor, okay? I get it.<eos> You're a doctor, huh?<eos> So, uh, where's your practice?<eos> Where's your house?<eos> - Where's your job? - [Elevator bell dings]<eos> I...<eos> Hey, Jared.<eos> You know, you can always call me. 24/7.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sharon R.: Well, we need to speak to you about this report, Buzz, because even to use these partials you found to form a likely print of a witness to your father's murder requires an investigatory reason. I have one.
Sammy...<eos> Let's talk.<eos> And God, an insurer of the cows...<eos> I think you have the wrong room.<eos> I need to speak to your sister, Hanif.<eos> We have nothing to talk about.<eos> We know what you think.<eos> You tell everyone.<eos> You cleaned yourself up.<eos> This is what you do to people who disagree with you?
He's only been conscious for an hour or so.<eos> But I can talk to him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Father.<eos> My true son.<eos> The doctor said you want to give me your kidney.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> I went for the tests.<eos> They took my blood and everything.<eos> I wanted to be connected to you, like I must have been when I was a little boy.
Please, listen to me...<eos> You just made the second mistake with me you're going to regret for the rest of your life, Bassam.<eos> - Emma!<eos> - ­Listen to me, please.<eos> Emma, I'm gonna get you out of there.<eos> She can't hear you.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Please.<eos> Let's... just negotiate, you and me.<eos> Why... should I negotiate with you, Bassam?
- Why don't we ask the patient?<eos> He'd want a consult from the best plastic surgeon in this hospital.<eos> You know that this is just as much a general-surgery case as it is a plastics.<eos> Right, and there are plenty of general surgeons and only one of me.<eos> I was here first.<eos> Oh! Oh, no!<eos> Holy crap!<eos> You ignored the moment completely.<eos> What moment?<eos> The moment where I say, "Go to New York," and then you ask me to come to New York with you... the moment.
Well, neither do I!<eos> I'm not telling him because we have been through enough.<eos> Especially him.<eos> Because he never got over the last one.<eos> He never had the chance to, and I am hanging on to every last shred of faith I have that this time, it'll be okay.<eos> But he doesn't have that.<eos> So it'll just be better if he doesn't know yet.<eos> It won't. You're making it worse.<eos> You're right.<eos> I am hard on you.
Why must you hurt me?<eos> All the things I will do for you.<eos> Things no woman has ever done, or let you do.<eos> I will make us no longer two... but one flesh.<eos> What God has joined together let no man split apart.<eos> That's what they'll do when they catch you!<eos> Split you in... two... I'm too alone without... you... I need you.<eos> Love you.<eos> Destroy you.<eos> So disappointed in you...
William!<eos> No!<eos> If you would live... come.<eos> I know you.<eos> You are a witch.<eos> Whatever I be, if I served him... would I have saved you?<eos> Come.<eos> Be not afraid.<eos> I know the horrors behind you.<eos> And I know all too well the horrors that lie in front of you.
Come.<eos> Be not afraid.<eos> I know the horrors behind you.<eos> And I know all too well the horrors that lie in front of you.<eos> And I would spare you all to come.<eos> The horrors haven't half begun.<eos> Everyone you ever knew or loved will die... horribly.<eos> And all... all because of you.<eos> There is another way... a sweet, swift way.<eos> I once stood as close to God as I stand to you now.
Let's go get that crystal.<eos> Let's.<eos> - Where should we start?<eos> - Actually, um...<eos> I was thinking maybe you should sit this one out.<eos> Oh, that's why you were trying to be delicate with me.<eos> You're worried the Evil Queen is about to come out to play.<eos> No, I just want what's best for you.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> When you're upset, we follow you to Hell.
Robin."<eos> Regina?<eos> You okay?<eos> What did it say?<eos> Please, Emma, if you're gonna try to make me feel better, don't.<eos> No, I know that I can't, and I won't.<eos> I'm... sorry about earlier.<eos> I was so wrapped up worrying about how you'd react to Hook,<eos> I...<eos> I wasn't there for you about Robin.
- What?<eos> ! - Nina and I found something.<eos> - Nina's back?<eos> - Not exactly.<eos> A-anyway, Joe Harris, the prison shrink, was on the payroll of a consulting firm that we've tied to Alice's companies.<eos> We need to talk to every employee - of that consulting firm.<eos> - I'll take care of that.<eos> - You gotta go downtown.<eos> - I do?<eos> Yeah. The chief wants to talk to you.
What a nice surprise.<eos> I hope I'm not interrupting some life-saving procedure.<eos> Just finished rounds.<eos> The, uh, med students were all thoroughly confused.<eos> I think we helped everyone by stopping.<eos> - Not ready to smile yet?<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - It was funny. - Mm.<eos> - So what's going on?<eos> - Um, I wanna talk to you.
- So what's going on?<eos> - Um, I wanna talk to you.<eos> Uh, I'm free in 20 minutes.<eos> You wanna go to the cafeteria?<eos> I...<eos> I can't wait.<eos> Okay. Um...<eos> Dr. Williams, intensive care. The shooting, it's, uh, brought a lot of things into perspective for me.<eos> I get that.<eos> - I have to break up with you.
You solved a murder on your last day on the job.<eos> Not bad.<eos> How come I don't feel better about it?<eos> This...<eos> - This should stay here.<eos> - Janey...<eos> - Why don't you take him?<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> He...<eos> He should stay here... with you.
This...<eos> - This should stay here.<eos> - Janey...<eos> - Why don't you take him?<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> He...<eos> He should stay here... with you.<eos> You know, he'd probably be your partner by now, so...<eos> He should be...<eos> He should be here to look after you.
- It's a turbo.<eos> - Yeah, it is.<eos> No! No crying!<eos> Come on.<eos> - Our locations are changing.<eos> That's it.<eos> - I know.<eos> I'm gonna go get dressed for this party.<eos> I'll see you there, okay?<eos> - Be right behind you.
- Maura, they have money... and ATMs.<eos> - Well, what if there's a power outage?<eos> - Well, then... the power adapter isn't gonna do you any good.<eos> - I set two alarms for tomorrow morning.<eos> - You don't need to.<eos> My flight is at 8:00, and I need to be at the airport.<eos> I told you I was gonna pick you up.<eos> No, we've talked about this.<eos> It's...<eos> It's too emotional for me to say goodbye to you at the airport.
He remodeled the kitchen.<eos> What's she doing here?<eos> What's she doing here?<eos> I live here now.<eos> With Dwight.<eos> Well, apparently, so do I.<eos> So do we.<eos> For now.<eos> I don't know why my son married you.<eos> You about as trustworthy as a snake in a hamster cage. I got my eye on you, sista.
Wordy stuff confuses me, and it's not the same.<eos> And taking our bar is way worse than being stupid, it's cunty.<eos> I hate AA, I think it's fucking stupid, but I went.<eos> You really want to stop drinking?<eos> - I mean, do you really want to?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I hope I see you at the next meeting.<eos> I'm getting some new IDs, some cash, and heading to Mexico.<eos> You should come.<eos> Come with you to Mexico?
You give it back!<eos> - Get the fuck off her!<eos> - You give it back!<eos> Fuck you!<eos> - Give me that stuff back!<eos> - No! - It's not yours!<eos> - You're crazy!<eos> What the fuck was that?<eos> It's not yours, Fiona!<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
Greeting cards she bought for our birthdays and holidays.<eos> I guess she never got around to mailing them.<eos> "Congrats on your retirement."<eos> Only she crossed out "retirement"<eos> and wrote "birthday."<eos> Always thinking of us, right?<eos> Right.<eos> Going for a run?<eos> Yeah, got to stay in shape.<eos> Can I join you?
I do not understand the appeal of pretending to be dead.<eos> - Oh, ho. Maybe Frankie can explain.<eos> - Are you shopping? What?<eos> There was a sale on blood capsules.<eos> Can we get out of here now, please?<eos> - Why?<eos> Are you scared?<eos> - No.<eos> This is "Night of the Living Dead" all over again.<eos> They're coming for you, Jane.

What?<eos> One more thing. I've been thinking.<eos> There's something I want you to know.<eos> - What? What is it?<eos> - Well, it's fairly new at this point.<eos> - It's about me and ...<eos> - There you are.<eos> Um, I'm sorry to interrupt.<eos> I ...<eos> Frankie, I really need to talk to you, privately.
- What's in the packages?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Illegal contraband.<eos> Jewels or drugs.<eos> We had a case last year that involved rare pheasants.<eos> I didn't know pheasants could be rare.<eos> Oh, they can be very rare.<eos> You'd be surprised how rare...<eos> Okay, can we focus, please?<eos> If Jack was into something illegal, - then why did he wanna meet with you?

Maybe.<eos> Do you know why we're here?<eos> No.<eos> Clair's mother was murdered.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Where were you last night?<eos> I was at a party at a friend's.<eos> - Does this friend have a name?<eos> - Steve Ulrich.<eos> Clair go with you?
But I remembered my name.<eos> And I completed a memory inventory of the skeletal structure from the "Gray's Anatomy" chart.<eos> And where would I find my levator anguli oris?<eos> There are two located symmetrically on either side of your face.<eos> And when they work in unison, the corners of the mouth move upward, producing what is universally known as a smile.<eos> - Textbook-perfect. - ‭<eos> Excellent sign of long-term memory.<eos> Jane has been calling every 20 minutes.<eos> Then I let her know that you are on your way up.<eos> And I also... asked Angela to let me take care of you.
- No.<eos> Maura's.<eos> Ma, you've got a great thing going here.<eos> Why change that?<eos> Do you remember when you were 15 and you asked me to stop cutting your hair?<eos> - Kind of.<eos> - Kind of?<eos> It was a huge decision for you.<eos> You sat me down like... like you were gonna move out.<eos> Well, we hated giving you adjustments.
They say that you play by new rules, basically no rules at all.<eos> "Give us what we want or die philosophy" is what they say.<eos> One would not have many friends if one lived a life like that.<eos> These your friends?<eos> Who are these people?<eos> We found your fingerprint on a gun in one of their shops.<eos> We're not buying that you don't know them.<eos> Are you implying that I am part of some kind - of criminal enterprise?<eos> - No, no, we're saying that.<eos> We're saying that you killed these two men because they made you angry or they... cut in line in front of you at Starbucks.
I hate the name Lisa.<eos> Relax.<eos> You'll only have it for a couple of days.<eos> That's as long as I'm gonna let you stay in Suffolk.<eos> - I can stay in there as long as I need to.<eos> - No, you can't.<eos> It's not safe.<eos> - That's a good-looking tattoo.<eos> - Oh, thank you.<eos> The warden is moving any inmates that might have possibly intersected with you.
Oh, crap, I gotta go!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You just won the Australian award for Digital Innovation in Next Gen Optimization.<eos> A D.I.N.G.O.!<eos> Yeah, yeah, I know. I got the email.<eos> Why aren't you more excited?<eos> It's supes prestige.<eos> They want you in Sydney this weekend.<eos> They're paying for everything, including a presidential suite - and first class tickets for two! - Elliot...<eos> Of course I'll go with you!
Uh, he's a 42-year-old CPA - with his own small firm. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Specializes in forensic accounting.<eos> He freelances with a variety of financial companies.<eos> Nothing out of the ordinary.<eos> No money problems, no criminal record, no pending litigation.<eos> Well, someone didn't like him.<eos> Okay, Nina... what's wrong?<eos> Did I do something or...<eos> No.<eos> It's got nothing to do with you.
Good.<eos> Been busy.<eos> You know... Girl Scouts, Little League.<eos> How's Ron?<eos> Dad's okay.<eos> Good. I'm glad to hear that.<eos> Take care.<eos> You too.<eos> Wait. Angela.<eos> I was sorry about what happened between you and my dad.
He said he would help me protect the firm.<eos> It's obvious the only thing he was interested in protecting was his own ass.<eos> Well, whatever's in these papers, he was willing to kill in order to keep secret.<eos> Will you help me figure out what that is?<eos> I'll try.<eos> What's going on, Angela?<eos> Um, I'm spying on Frankie.<eos> I mean with you and me.<eos> Uh, I... I don't know what you mean.<eos> Joann said she ran into you in the park.
343... nautical miles.<eos> It's 7 hours and 7 minutes via route 15.<eos> Well, that's still really far for a cup of coffee.<eos> When is this happening?<eos> There's still a lot of details to work out... my... my background check, things like that.<eos> I haven't told BPD.<eos> I just, you know, wanted you to know.<eos> My daughter, the FBI agent.<eos> I-Instructor.<eos> I'm proud of you, Janie.
Chicago's been good to us.<eos> Chicago's too far away.<eos> I needed to get away.<eos> I felt smothered here.<eos> By who?<eos> By me?<eos> No.<eos> You know, I just had to be on my own, grow up.<eos> Well, you grew up.<eos> I'm proud of you.
- Hey.<eos> - Hi, Maura. - Oh.<eos> Hello.<eos> Wha...<eos> I'm guessing you're canceling dinner.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just got called out to advise on a case.<eos> I'm on a plane for Philly in an hour.<eos> Yeah, the monkey suit kind of gave it away, so...<eos> Sorry. I can honestly tell you there's nothing I'd rather be doing than having dinner with you.
He missed his wife.<eos> He was looking for a job, why?<eos> Why would he blow all of that?<eos> There usually isn't a why.<eos> You know that.<eos> And we have Caskey in Inwood during Robin's attack.<eos> You saw him there half an hour later.<eos> What about the Hempstead rape?<eos> Liv is bringing in that victim to see if she can get a voice I.D., but I'm gonna go check with Caskey's parole officer to check his whereabouts that day.<eos> Let me come with you.
You used to dream of a big wedding?<eos> I don't know, it's just... - not where I'm at now.<eos> - Well, it's not really all about you, is it?<eos> My wedding?<eos> It kind of is.<eos> Nah.<eos> It's also about your family.<eos> We get to show you off.<eos> Plus, your dad didn't get to throw you a communion party or your quinceañera.<eos> And he's proud of you.
What do I care about a rainbow?<eos> My own daughter put me in jail.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> Here's Magda, back in her old, familiar stomping grounds.<eos> _<eos> Because you killed a man, Mother.<eos> In self-defense.<eos> Well, with one crucial difference.<eos> _<eos> Look, I didn't come here to fight with you.
I have one.<eos> I still have a fist.<eos> Gold still has a nose.<eos> If you don't like it, I'll do this alone.<eos> I get it. I want to help my family, too, but we have to be smart about this.<eos> Didn't you see the sign?<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Alone.<eos> The Savior doesn't even know I'm here.<eos> So, what makes you think I have any interest in talking to you?
They will once they learn you knowingly hired a fraud.<eos> One has nothing to do with the other.<eos> And if you really did find a judge who would do that, then you'd be here with an army of lawyers and a Brinks truck instead of standing alone with a flimsy piece of paper in your sweaty little hands.<eos> You can talk tough all you want, Jessica.<eos> The fact is, I do have an army of lawyers and you don't.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I took that job with Robert Zane after all.<eos> And I'm willing to drag this fight out, so the choice is yours.<eos> Give us our money or go out of business.<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?
Is that--?<eos> Yeah.<eos> One bullet with bobo's name on it.<eos> he'll show.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> We'll be ready.<eos> You'll be ready.<eos> You're in the crosshairs of a revenant.<eos> The worst revenant.<eos> Bobo comes looking for you?
You're sick, but I can make you better.<eos> I don't want to hurt you.<eos> Ugh!<eos> - OK.<eos> See, I don't have that problem.<eos> Willa!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, fighting off the local boys in your underwear?<eos> Boy, you did grow up.<eos> - What happened to you?
- The Triangle is not only a prison.<eos> - For who?<eos> - Not a who.<eos> A what.<eos> Listen.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> I'm the goddamn Earp heir.<eos> I got work to do.<eos> Good luck, Wynonna.<eos> We'll be watching you.
Good night, Daddy.<eos> So, Mr. Mayor, how does it feel?<eos> Sudden.<eos> And somehow well deserved.<eos> Nothing like standing on a dead guy's shoulders to get there.<eos> What?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> I just...<eos> No!<eos> What the hell's the matter with you?
She... she's losing a lot of blood.<eos> We can't take her to the hospital.<eos> That's the first place they'll check.<eos> - He got out!<eos> - The loft.<eos> I'll bring the car up.<eos> Get Monroe and Rosalee.<eos> Black Claw will try to kill them tonight.<eos> Aah! Something's not right.<eos> What, with you?
Someone got angry with me.<eos> He hurt you.<eos> Yes, he did.<eos> Was it Daddy?<eos> No, no, of course not.<eos> Then who?<eos> It was a friend of Daddy's, but don't worry about that.<eos> Okay?<eos> Let's get you back to bed.<eos> Come on, I'll lay down with you.
Gunnery Sergeant Davis has a perfectly capable psychiatrist right here in this hospital.<eos> I told you, one of my colleagues is treating him.<eos> Doc, I need you to get through.<eos> That's right.<eos> You need.<eos> Ah, geez.<eos> Listen.<eos> Will you just listen?<eos> No, you listen.<eos> Davis is more likely to connect with you than anyone.
We should do this more often.<eos> Eat lunch?<eos> Together.<eos> Spontaneously.<eos> For no reason.<eos> Unless there's a reason.<eos> Hmm. If you're thinking you have to make up for something... it's okay.<eos> Wh... this morning is over and done.<eos> Here's the thing:<eos> I wasn't 100% honest with you on the phone.
Dmitri made a choice to spy for this country.<eos> He must have felt it was worth it.<eos> You make it sound so honorable.<eos> He was a terrified kid who didn't want to die.<eos> And Talia Petrov is an innocent.<eos> The victim of everything we've done.<eos> I am not going to leave her there to die, too.<eos> You didn't have to be alone in this.<eos> You-you could have talked to me.<eos> I can't talk to you!
And, uh, I can come back this evening.<eos> Is it work?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> It's all right.<eos> You can go if you have to.<eos> It's nothing I can't put off.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Really, I promise.<eos> You sure?<eos> You don't want the kids with you?
Beats sitting around here.<eos> Ain't we Baptists, though?<eos> We all God's children, T.<eos> And I got a thing for yentas.<eos> I like my women smart and fiery.<eos> Yeah, me, too. I had a brief Bette Midler phase.<eos> Hey, I'm gonna see y'all pinheads tomorrow.<eos> Where you going?<eos> Won five grand on the hardwood this week. - I got to go pick it up.<eos> - Let me keep you company.
But I just want to let you know it's not a problem.<eos> I just got to kind of wrap my head around the switch, you know?<eos> Hell, I even tried to jack off the other night with my right hand.<eos> Didn't really work out so good.<eos> I guess what I'm saying is I got to get used to more run blocking, which is not a problem if what I heard is true.<eos> Actually, we just signed Phil Martz at right tackle.<eos> I know Philly.<eos> He's a real good player.<eos> He is.<eos> We're gonna let you go, Charles.
It's a great way to get laid.<eos> And I will look into it right away.<eos> But there's a downside.<eos> Vern's been at home on the couch reading negative shit about himself all day.<eos> Well, that's just not healthy.<eos> I'm thinking to get something to brighten his mood.<eos> Came to check first.<eos> That is a major step towards fiscal responsibility, Reg.<eos> - I'm learning.<eos> - I am proud of you.
Well, he's killing it.<eos> You know him.<eos> Andre Alan.<eos> What?<eos> You're not fucking joking.<eos> Shit.<eos> Oh, man, you know what? You know what? Maybe it's not such a good idea that I'm here.<eos> Don't be silly.<eos> Andre's the one who asked me to invite you.<eos> I am right here for you.
We want you to do everything that you can to save our daughter.<eos> No!<eos> This is not what she'd want.<eos> She could wake up.<eos> I mean, people wake up from comas all the time.<eos> Um, I'm sorry, but in Tess' case, that's highly unlikely.<eos> She told me what she wants.<eos> More than once.<eos> Please, she would not want to live like this.<eos> What is wrong with you?
Okay.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe next time, be a little more specific.<eos> You know how long it's been since I saw your mother?<eos> No idea, sir.<eos> Too long!<eos> Her plane lands any minute.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure that trip's a complete coincidence, right?<eos> Nothing to do with me or... her or... I don't know... anything you might have mentioned.<eos> Um, my wife and I don't have any secrets between us, Jackson.<eos> I enjoy seeing her, and she enjoys seeing you.
Come on, she can't be that bad.<eos> No, she's worse than bad.<eos> She can be terrifying.<eos> Like a... hurricane.<eos> When she hits, you do not want to be in her wake.<eos> Well, you can't avoid her forever, not when she's about to become Hurricane Granny.<eos> Maybe not, but...<eos> I can avoid her for now.<eos> You ready?<eos> My first surgery's with you.
And it was unfair of me to put you there.<eos> I know that, and... it will not happen again.<eos> No. I know it won't.<eos> I promise.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> But I can't count on it.<eos> Right now, I have to count on myself.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> You're just... not in this with me.<eos> So I can't do this with you, not right now, and... maybe not at all.
It was one thing when it was about me, but now...<eos> You know...<eos> Say...<eos> Okay, when you see Sofia kick a ball across the room and you start to daydream about 20 years from now when Sofia scores the winning goal at the Women's World Cup Final and the whole stadium is chanting her name...<eos> "Torres!<eos> Torres!"<eos> And it's all in slow motion and you're up in the stands screaming and crying.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> You do that, too?<eos> So... the question is, who do you want... screaming and cheering beside you?
Don't say it.<eos> Sylvia, don't say it.<eos> - Never mind!<eos> Sorry, Jenny.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> Kind of.<eos> - No, really, I'm-- I'm very sorry.<eos> I truly do apologize.<eos> You must be in hell.<eos> You seem like a very nice person and this has absolutely nothing to do with you. You seem like a very nice person and this has absolutely nothing to do with you.
Should I call Ms. Wilson, let her know you found it?<eos> Fine, take it.<eos> Careful, Liam.<eos> I used to think Frank would be a real dad someday, too.<eos> You and that little spic you sneezed out of the cavern you called your uterus better start looking for a new last name.<eos> I'm disinheriting both of you and taking back the Gallagher name.<eos> Gladly.<eos> And while I'm at it, Franny's gonna go by her middle name from now on...<eos> Harry.<eos> So she has no more connection to you.
Harry.<eos> So she has no more connection to you.<eos> Harry!<eos> Well, that's a perfect name for the diesel dyke she's gonna grow up to be someday.<eos> Come on, kid.<eos> We got work to do.<eos> Hey, Carl.<eos> Hey, bunch of us are going to the movies tonight.<eos> You want to come?<eos> I told you, I can't hang out with you for 72 hours.
Felix, I don't want to marry you.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm not proposing to you.<eos> You're not?<eos> I'm so relieved.<eos> Wait, you're relieved?<eos> Yes, Dani had me convinced that you were gonna propose.<eos> So the idea of marrying me is that horrible.<eos> No, it's just too early.<eos> I have no idea if I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
You don't like me.<eos> That's fine.<eos> You're only here for five more days.<eos> And if you think I don't know how to deal with an annoying roommate, well, you are sorely mistaken.<eos> Felix, amazing news!<eos> They just offered Brandon a permanent job in Somalia, and he's going to take it, which means I get to keep Biscuit!<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> And deny this pup an enriching trip to Africa?<eos> I am gonna spend so much time with you.
Hey, you know what might be a good idea?<eos> A nice, brisk walk.<eos> If it's exercise you're after...<eos> No thanks, I'm good.<eos> Oscar, what's going on?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Why?<eos> Just tell me... is there something wrong with me?<eos> No.<eos> There's nothing wrong with you.

I would be a driver, licensed by the great state of New York.<eos> Learner's permit.<eos> Line two.<eos> Is this gonna take long?<eos> I'm parked in a red zone.<eos> You parked illegally at the DMV?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Last place they'd look.<eos> Gosh, it seems like only yesterday you were a middle-aged man showing up on my doorstep, but now you're learning to drive.<eos> I'm proud of you, champ.
And I'm sorry that I didn't ask you to teach me.<eos> I didn't know that I wanted to be asked till you didn't ask me.<eos> Can't believe I asked Murph.<eos> I wonder if they made a baby.<eos> I count on you for so much... food, clothing, getting food off my clothing... it's nice to be able to return the favor.<eos> Well, I should have asked you first...<eos> you were clearly the best choice.<eos> Of course.<eos> Who knows you better than me?<eos> It's funny, the thing that scared me most about driving was the unpredictability, and yet, living with you has taught me to accept a certain amount of chaos.
You just want to be left alone.<eos> A vote for me is a vote for peace and quiet.<eos> Remember on election day, "O" for Oscar.<eos> You got my vote.<eos> Running out of doughnuts.<eos> How many more doors you want to knock on?<eos> Just a couple more.<eos> Plus I got Murph out there talking me up to the neighbors.<eos> The common man loves a celebrity.<eos> Oscar, what's come over you?
Although the song-craft is rudimentary, stream-of-consciousness barking set to robot music.<eos> It's a 21st-century art form.<eos> Oh, do you hear that?<eos> That's the sound of Mozart coming back to life and then killing himself.<eos> Also, my-my asthma's acting up.<eos> I think it's dust from all the vintage clothing.<eos> And everyone's eyes are dilated.<eos> I suspect narcotics.<eos> Enough!<eos> What is wrong with you?
Fellas.<eos> I really screwed things up with her.<eos> And I know she's out of my league and all we do is argue.<eos> But I don't know.<eos> She makes me want to be the kind of guy that could get that kind of a girl.<eos> I'm going to hug you.<eos> No, no, no, we're too close!<eos> - We're too close!<eos> - Embrace the hug.<eos> Hey, I'm proud of you.
Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> Oscar, it's a busy night.<eos> Can we pick this up another time?<eos> No, I have to ask you this now or I'll regret it for the rest of my life.<eos> Charlotte... will you please not marry me?<eos> Wait, what?<eos> I got way ahead of myself.<eos> We haven't even been on a real date yet.<eos> And the whole point of dating is to find out all the awful things about a person so you can stop dating them.<eos> And that's what I want with you, Charlotte.
Oh, right, sure.<eos> I'll... I'll just go busy myself... In o trash.<eos> That dumpster's got to be around here somewhere.<eos> Oh! Maybe it's in Meredith's master bedroom.<eos> I'll just take a quick peek.<eos> What are you doing? !<eos> Mer-Mer?<eos> Is that my négligée?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I just admire you so much, and I saw it, and... and... and... oh, promise me you're not mad!
I just... I just don't get it.<eos> There are pine cones everywhere.<eos> You mean barnathium crystals?<eos> Those are worthless.<eos> Well, now I must return to my home world to restore order.<eos> I'll pick you up at 4:30, Mr. Mayor.<eos> My shark just swam out the front door.<eos> Did you set it free?<eos> Shut up and hang these curtains.<eos> Whoa! What's got into you?
Homies, over here.<eos> Mr. C8, Miss A8.<eos> It's your new seats.<eos> I got here early to make sure we weren't sat next to some weenball.<eos> He doesn't realize that's him.<eos> Oh, please tell me I'm in the back somewhere.<eos> I need to catch up on my sleep.<eos> No...<eos> B4.<eos> But the good news is, I'm right behind you.
- Laurel, I...<eos> You won't even respond to my texts!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't want you to be sorry.<eos> I just want you to talk to me.<eos> I want that, too.<eos> Well, then what's wrong?<eos> When I look at you... all I see is Frank.<eos> And I need to forget what he did.<eos> I will never forgive him for what he did to you.
My parents...<eos> They found some of Hyde's people, sent them to Granny's for food and shelter.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> I could use some food and shelter right about now.<eos> You go ahead.<eos> I'm I'm gonna stay.<eos> Stay?<eos> It's pitch-black and it's freezing.<eos> Are you really that desperate to avoid talking to me?<eos> I'm not avoiding talking to you.
You go ahead.<eos> I'm I'm gonna stay.<eos> Stay?<eos> It's pitch-black and it's freezing.<eos> Are you really that desperate to avoid talking to me?<eos> I'm not avoiding talking to you.<eos> I just...<eos> I... need to be alone.<eos> Emma... look at your hand.<eos> - What the hell is going on with you?
And now, Belle, you are with child.<eos> The child was in danger, so you put yourself to sleep to keep it safe.<eos> Now that danger is gone, and I need you to wake up.<eos> This... is the truth.<eos> But so is what I saw.<eos> All those broken promises...<eos> Rumple...<eos> I do love you, and I believe that you love me, but us being together... it only causes heartbreak.<eos> But the b... the baby.<eos> Our child will be better off waiting with me than being in debt to you.
Baby steps, I guess.<eos> Mm.<eos> I suppose I could try getting rid of the golf ball.<eos> Oh. Okay.<eos> I will always have the dent to remember it by.<eos> You did it.<eos> Do you feel okay?<eos> Actually, yes.<eos> I do.<eos> Well, I'm proud of you.
You are a superhero.<eos> No, I'm really not.<eos> I'm just an ordinary guy.<eos> You were an ordinary guy, Alan.<eos> That's how most superheroes start out...<eos> Mild-mannered weaklings, and that's you!<eos> Wow, thanks.<eos> Relax.<eos> It's all to maximize your transformative arc.<eos> If I agree with you, will you leave me alone?
How much time do we have?<eos> Well, we're meeting at Botticelli's in 30 minutes?<eos> Tonight?<eos> You said yourself it's time to start living.<eos> Yes, I just thought it would be after we apprehended your would-be murderer.<eos> I know.<eos> I will just embrace my powers.<eos> Maybe this is my origin story, and my dinner with Gwen will be the beginning of something really terrific!<eos> That's the spirit, Alan.<eos> And I'm going with you.
What's wrong?<eos> Nothing's wrong.<eos> I want a divorce.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm in the middle of something.<eos> Okay, you take care of that.<eos> I'll have my lawyer call you.<eos> This is about your investigator, isn't it?<eos> - My investigator? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Yes.<eos> I would never think of divorcing you unless I had some other man to call my own.
Neil?<eos> Yeah, the divorce lawyer.<eos> He suggested we do a one-lawyer divorce since it's amicable.<eos> We don't have to use him if you want to agree on someone else.<eos> One-one-one minute.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think that's... smart.<eos> Good.<eos> Because I don't want to fight with you.
Answering your cell at a dinner party?<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> Um, yeah, I'm standing right next to him.<eos> Why? Who is it?<eos> Mike Tascioni.<eos> Tom is sick.<eos> Why's he calling you?<eos> And why's he calling you about his dog?<eos> We've grown close.<eos> He couldn't get a hold of you.
It'll be all right, all right.<eos> Dad... I need help.<eos> Oh, come on, Bones, don't you even want to try to talk this out?<eos> No, why would I?<eos> You're not an expert in this field.<eos> Field?<eos> In what field, listening to you?<eos> 'Cause trust me, no one has logged more hours.<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> I'm coming with you.
Chapter seven.<eos> I can't believe how good of a reader you are.<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> "There was a table set out under a tree "in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it."<eos> Yes.<eos> Sorry to break up the tea party, but Hank's asleep.<eos> That means Daddy's got to get to work.<eos> You go put your shoes on, okay?<eos> All right.<eos> Can I talk to you?
All I'm saying is that their deaths fit the profile.<eos> Or it could simply explain his profession.<eos> Often those who enter psychology do so because they have suffered traumatic loss.<eos> You're defending him.<eos> No, I am merely pointing out that you have no proof.<eos> Think about it.<eos> This guy is smart, he knows basic anatomy, and he is manipulative!<eos> Nothing you are saying is proof.<eos> He was trying to help.<eos> He was playing you.

Dr. Vaziri, the cameras don't lie.<eos> Well, then why don't you be a decent human being and turn them off.<eos> Cam...<eos> Dr. Saroyan has told you multiple times that she wants to keep her personal life personal.<eos> So why can't you respect that? N... Uh, that's okay.<eos> You don't have to do this anymore.<eos> I love you.<eos> I-I love the way you protect me, and I love the way you fight for me.<eos> And I...<eos> I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
In comparison, armor-piercing bullets seem passé.<eos> Speaking of super villains, you asked about my father today and then you disappeared for an hour.<eos> Why do I sense a connection?<eos> Well, because there is one.<eos> He thinks that one of his people is selling company secrets to a rival.<eos> He asked me to look into it.<eos> Only you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He said that you two were on the outs.<eos> Look, I told him that I'd have to talk to you about it before I agreed to help.
You enjoy human suffering.<eos> The cry of animals merely depresses me.<eos> People are not animals but puppets...<eos> dolls, toys.<eos> And toys are meant to be played with.<eos> I do believe a few more strokes and your toy will be dead.<eos> She deserves it.<eos> But the innocent life inside her womb does not!<eos> She is with child.<eos> And it signed no contract with you.
Nope.<eos> What's so funny?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - What if I talk to him?<eos> Why, because his love for you runs so deep?<eos> You have a better suggestion?<eos> Yeah, you could drop out of the race, spare yourself the embarrassment when this all comes out.<eos> You do realize Susan goes down, too.<eos> Susan had nothing to do with this.<eos> Technically, no, but she's associated with you now, and you, which means when your names turn to dirt, which they will, so will hers.
Hey.<eos> I should've come by sooner, but so much has happened since...<eos> I know exactly why you're here, Mellie.<eos> So just stop.<eos> Don't insult me by lying to my face.<eos> You want the truth, Andrew?<eos> You didn't choose me.<eos> You chose him.<eos> Fitz.<eos> I wanted to be with you.

Under the White House.<eos> There are people who are trying to kill you.<eos> The only person who ever tried to kill me is him.<eos> I never tried to kill you.<eos> I know how to kill people.<eos> - Huck.<eos> - Get me out of here!<eos> Right now!<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I don't think you appreciate the forces you unleashed by talking about what happened to you, what happened to me.
Very helpful.<eos> Well, the real question is how are you going to feel if you don't tell her and she gets hurt?<eos> So you'd tell her?<eos> Of course.<eos> (sighs)<eos> Hey, Mom...<eos> Marjorie has something she wants to tell you.<eos> I'm not telling her.<eos> You just said you would.<eos> I said I would if I were you.
White jeans!<eos> You don't have those.<eos> I'm sorry, Mom.<eos> No more cousin stuff.<eos> I'm putting my foot down, and not in those Crocs.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm just gonna try these snowpants on you while you talk. No!<eos> It's high school... a fresh start.<eos> First impressions are key.<eos> Most people decide what they think about you within the first seven seconds of meeting you.
I think so.<eos> This is it, right?<eos> Mm.<eos> I had a little trouble at first.<eos> You said to go south on Glenville, but you didn't say if it was your south or my south.<eos> [Chuckles] Well, April, these are my parents.<eos> Parents, this is April!<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm April.<eos> It's so nice to finally meet you, April.
_<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> What'd I miss?<eos> Just me complaining, and you get enough of that at home.<eos> She had to do the agent update today.<eos> - It's fine, really.<eos> - It's not fine.<eos> It's not fine.<eos> You finally speak Shelby!<eos> I'm so proud of you!
Huh. No one's ever gotten a perfect score before.<eos> Nothing turns me on more than some mystery.<eos> That right there might be a too talented Mr. Ripley.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> What are you doing here, Raina?<eos> I'm an interpreter for the summit.<eos> Where is Alex?<eos> I knew she was coming to see you.
Bates!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Well, I'm glad you made a friend.<eos> I'm just trying to keep myself away from you.<eos> Yeah, well, it's not working, 'cause León has pieced together that we're a little bit more than just colleagues.<eos> I'd be lying if I didn't say this was a little weird for me, watching you slip in and out of your cover so perfectly, being able to lie so easily.<eos> I mean, it just...<eos> We were in such a good place, Ryan.<eos> Yeah... With you lying to me.<eos> When did Keyes contact you, huh?
This is DC Blackstone.<eos> Can we have a word?<eos> - What about?<eos> - Mr Xun Li.<eos> - Can you spare me for a couple of hours?<eos> - Now? I just got a call from a cop shop in Thirsk.<eos> They've nicked Tamsin Richards for drink driving.<eos> - So?<eos> - So she wants to see me.<eos> Why would the wife of a villain like Richards wanna see you?
I need someone to put their hand into the birth canal and push the baby back upwards.<eos> Barbara, will you do it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Applying pressure.<eos> Barbara!<eos> Again, Barbara!<eos> BABY CRIES<eos> Come on, come on, open your eyes, Mummy!<eos> Well done, Trixie.<eos> I couldn't be more proud of you.
Previously on, "Rectify."<eos> Where are you goin', Janet?<eos> Ted, we're not gonna figure this out right now.<eos> Amantha and I are... taking a step back for a bit, on a personal front.<eos> Hey, Daniel.<eos> It's your mama.<eos> Everybody misses you terribly.<eos> Well, I haven't been there for you.
But it's good to see her, too.<eos> I'm sure it is.<eos> Her therapist, she told us to meet in a neutral place... you know, kind of avoid certain triggers or whatever.<eos> It helps us, you know, practice being more honest with each other.<eos> Kind of new age-y, but...<eos> Still, it sounds very challenging, trying to be honest without all the baggage.<eos> It's kind of working for me, really.<eos> Hopefully Tawney, too.<eos> Takes a lot of courage to do what you're doing.<eos> I'm proud of you.
Really, Mom?<eos> I just know he's soaking wet in that old tent.<eos> Does he have his phone with him?<eos> I made him take it, even though he protested.<eos> Well, why don't you call him if it'll make you feel better?<eos> I'll get a lecture.<eos> Or not.<eos> You talk to Jon lately?<eos> It's 3:00 in the morning.<eos> It just seems like I never even get to talk to you anymore.
I thinks she went hunting with Billy.<eos> Amantha?<eos> Evidently.<eos> Teddy set for the meeting?<eos> Said he'd be there.<eos> That's the right call.<eos> I think so.<eos> No matter what Mr. Childers says regarding the store, I'm still going up to see Daniel on Friday.<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> I'd like to go with you.
I don't know what the hell I was thinkin'.<eos> Best laid plans.<eos> Well...<eos> How's the fettucine?<eos> Cheesy.<eos> Well, I'll have to go soon, I guess.<eos> Is that right?<eos> To work.<eos> You know, if we're not gonna talk about what's going on in our lives, outside of whether we're gonna stay together or not, I don't know what the hell date night's even for.<eos> And just because I'm upset doesn't mean I'm upset at you or that it's even about you, Tawney.
I still don't believe you.<eos> I think there's somebody in your life.<eos> You're not telling me everything, Mr. Zeke.<eos> You're a good girl.<eos> Say your prayers, you'll be all right.<eos> Why do you keep sayin' that to me?<eos> You keep asking for it.<eos> It's in everything you do.<eos> Hey. It's me.<eos> I... I know that this store situation is a big deal, and... and I'm... I'm sorry that I wasn't there for you tonight.
You keep asking for it.<eos> It's in everything you do.<eos> Hey. It's me.<eos> I... I know that this store situation is a big deal, and... and I'm... I'm sorry that I wasn't there for you tonight.<eos> I really am.<eos> I get all in my head sometimes.<eos> It's something I'm...<eos> I'm working on with Rebecca.<eos> Hey. It's me.<eos> I... I know that this store situation is a big deal, and... and I'm... I'm sorry that I wasn't there for you tonight.
Yes to whatever you're talkin' about.<eos> I don't know.<eos> To... to... be here.<eos> To be dropped off like a...<eos> Perpetual teenager?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I don't know.<eos> This is... just where I am.<eos> In this car.<eos> With you.
Previously on Rectify...<eos> No matter what Mr. Childers says regarding the store,<eos> - I'm still going up to see Daniel.<eos> - I'd like to go with you.
- I'm still going up to see Daniel.<eos> - I'd like to go with you.<eos> It's not good to get too personally involved with residents.<eos> We're in the midst of an ongoing investigation.<eos> I'm sure you understand.<eos> What I don't understand is you, Sheriff.<eos> Do you think I should just do it?<eos> - Do what?<eos> - Leave.<eos> I'm sorry that I wasn't there for you tonight.
Listen, Daniel.<eos> When I asked you to leave the house that night, I was pretty angry.<eos> Understandable, Ted.<eos> And, um, well... it's not always good to say things when you're...<eos> I'm not saying I didn't have the right to be angry, Daniel.<eos> Of course not.<eos> Anyway, uh...<eos> I hope things can be... you know...<eos> Ted, you don't owe me an explanation or an apology.<eos> I've always greatly admired you and, uh, still do.
How's the museum?<eos> The museum?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's hard to say, as I have limited experience in the world of museums, but, uh, I certainly think it fits within the mean.<eos> The mean of what?<eos> It's not the Louvre, but it's not Knickknack City either.<eos> It's somewhere in between.<eos> What are you doing, Daniel?<eos> What are you doing, Mother?<eos> I just want to see you, be with you.
I don't want you to feel like you have to be a tour guide and take me to places that you've never been and talk about things that you don't care about.<eos> Parthenon of Nashville, Mother?<eos> Secular heresy.<eos> I just want to know your life.<eos> Your life.<eos> Why would you want to know that?<eos> So I can understand.<eos> Understand what?<eos> Where you are, who you are, what you're doing.<eos> You know why I didn't want to see you, Mother?
It needed to be said.<eos> I needed to hear it.<eos> If that's true, I'm glad.<eos> I don't know if I'll stay married to Ted.<eos> We see the world so differently.<eos> I hope it wasn't wrong to tell you that.<eos> Why would it be wrong?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know, honey.<eos> I don't know how to talk to you.
I get it.<eos> I wouldn't have invited me, either.<eos> I've missed a lot.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> In my defense, I was stoned for most of the '90s.<eos> And the 2000s.<eos> Full disclosure...<eos> I was stoned this morning.<eos> I like weed.<eos> But the point is, if you can forgive me even a little, I'd love to have a drink with you.
Satou's gonna kill a ton of people!<eos> He's a problem we can't ignore!<eos> That is beyond my comprehension.<eos> I don't care about what happens to people.<eos> What is wrong with him?<eos> What the fuck is wrong with him?<eos> He claims he will take down the headquarters of Grant Pharmaceuticals ten days from now.<eos> You're running out of time. I'm looking forward to seeing you try, Tosaki.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
I know it's hard right now ima ga kurushii kara tte<eos> Yeah, yeah, make sure you don't stand out yeah yeah medatanai you ni<eos> Yeah, yeah, make sure you can bear it yeah yeah taerareru you ni<eos> Yeah, yeah, make sure your brain never stops yeah yeah shikou kairou wa mada tomenai you ni<eos> I just want to sleep ima wa tada nemuritai<eos> Starts<eos> Now then, where should I start?<eos> Anything you want to know in particular, four-eyes? Start wherever.<eos> In any case, you'll be telling me everything you know.<eos> God, you're boring.
Bye.<eos> (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)<eos> (TIRES SCREECHING)<eos> Why are you following me?<eos> (PANTING)<eos> Emma.<eos> Dad?<eos> (CRYING)<eos> - Are you real?<eos> - I was just trying to figure out the best way to approach you, you know... to talk to you... to let you know that I'm back here in Lakewood.
- No!<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> - Again with the lies.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - That was a joke.<eos> I don't need to know what we are tonight.<eos> I just need to be with you.
- Help me, Emily.<eos> - Ali?<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What?<eos> Your back.<eos> Oh, um, it's nothing. It's fine.<eos> That's definitely not nothing, Hanna. Those..<eos> God, those look like burn marks.<eos> Did that happen to you in there?
- He freaked out.<eos> - Where the hell is Jason?<eos> - Ethiopia.<eos> - What's he doing there?<eos> - Charity work.<eos> - Here.<eos> I have to get to work.<eos> Okay, we'll let you know what we find.<eos> So where's, uh, where's Jordan?<eos> I thought he was gonna be coming back with you.
- No. No, he went back to Boston.<eos> We broke up.<eos> Wait, I thought everything was going great with you guys.<eos> Yeah, it was.<eos> It's just, Ezra and I, we spent a lot of time with each other these last few weeks and..<eos> ...I just realized how much I missed having him in my life.<eos> We're both lucky.<eos> I've got Ezra, you've got Jordan.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you think you'll tell him what happened to you in there?
I'm Eliza.<eos> Look, I don't know why Elliott would lie about this but his family doesn't own a farm.<eos> There's nobody with the name Rollins in the county.<eos> Well, I'm starting to wonder if he's telling the truth about anything.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> You look like my dolls.<eos> - What dolls?<eos> - The ones Charlotte gave me.<eos> I found the lipstick, but Charlotte gave me the dolls.<eos> - Can we play with you?
Actually, I couldn't stop thinking about it all during lunch.<eos> - Really?<eos> - I judged you too quickly.<eos> That's not who I am.<eos> Why don't we start over?<eos> Clean slate.<eos> Let's get dinner this week.<eos> You're on.<eos> You know, I didn't even want another drink.<eos> I just wanted an excuse to talk to you.
That's what he used on me.<eos> A cattle prod?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Hanna?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Ali's the one who needs help now.<eos> No, he's not gonna get away with this.<eos> Elliott will pay for what he did to you.
Later.<eos> Come on, Spence.<eos> Look, I get it, okay?<eos> You're confused.<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Look.<eos> There's a part of me that will always love Hanna, okay?<eos> She was my first real love.<eos> But it's you I wanna be with.
Look.<eos> There's a part of me that will always love Hanna, okay?<eos> She was my first real love.<eos> But it's you I wanna be with.<eos> And if Hanna wanted to be with you now?<eos> - Would that change things?<eos> - No. Do you mean that or do you just feel obligated to say it?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Look, after that time we spent together in Madrid I couldn't stop thinking about you.<eos> And then we met up again in DC and the more time we spent together the more I wanted to be with you.
I promise.<eos> Oh, sorry, I didn't order this.<eos> I know.<eos> He did.<eos> Okay.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I thought we were....<eos> If you leave me in these I'll be trapped.<eos> I know.<eos> But the nurses have to see what he did to you.
Well, you were wrong.<eos> I know, but you had already checked yourself into Welby and we all thought that Elliot was gonna be able to protect you.<eos> No, okay, you thought that Hanna's life was worth more than mine.<eos> Hey, in case you forgot, Hanna just ran over the guy who really is to blame for all of this.<eos> We did everything we could to save you, Ali.<eos> Just like we did everything we could to save Hanna.<eos> What is it?<eos> Mary said Detective Furey is at home with an update.<eos> - I've gotta go.<eos> - Well, I'm coming with you.
Alright, so what else did you not like about the business plan?<eos> Everything.<eos> Got it.<eos> You know, this would be a lot easier if you were here.<eos> In person.<eos> Because I have a degree in fashion not boring numbers that don't add up.<eos> Hold on one second.<eos> Hey, I'm gonna have to call you back.<eos> Yes, I nixed the pie charts.<eos> Alright, I'll talk to you later.
Home.<eos> Why?<eos> Are the police still outside your house?<eos> Yeah. What's going on, Hanna?<eos> We think A.D. is heading your way.<eos> He might even be there already.<eos> You mean Jenna and Sara.<eos> No, he, as in Elliot Rollins.<eos> The same guy who put a muzzle over you and fed you crazy pills.<eos> He crawled out of his own damn grave and he's coming for you.
Official or off the record?<eos> Help me, Toby Wan Kenobi.<eos> You're my only hope.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It was a terrible joke.<eos> I don't even know why...<eos> That means he's staying with you.<eos> No, but you know where he is.<eos> Caleb just needs some time to think.<eos> Okay. He'll reach out to you when he's ready.
Well, we shared his plate information and description with the local authorities and highway patrol as far west as Denver.<eos> Miss DiLaurentis, this guy he's turned your entire life upside down.<eos> I won't stop until we find him.<eos> And two Red Eyes and one of those lattes with soy.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, can I interrupt?<eos> Hey, uh, yeah.<eos> I know I said I would call but I thought I better do this in person.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Listen, when I saw you earlier today...
- I...<eos> I'm not talking about Jen.<eos> - Noel Kahn.<eos> Did you miss me?<eos> What are these?<eos> Well, by no means can they top that rock on your finger.<eos> But after what happened to Ali I started thinking that we're like this crazy, dysfunctional family.<eos> But we work together.<eos> And I've just decided that I'm at a point in my life where I'm wanna put the people who've had my back before anything else.<eos> I'm right there with you.
Some actual fun friends.<eos> You know, Em, I have to admit, tonight has really been a blast.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Thank you, sweetheart.<eos> Come on.<eos> Toby!<eos> Hey.<eos> Come in.<eos> So I've been... thinking a lot about what you said today.<eos> I just wanna be honest with you.
They're better than the odds of us getting anything accomplished if we stick around here.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Okay.<eos> So how was your first day of school?<eos> Usual pranks.<eos> At least you've already been teaching there.<eos> It's not like it was your first time back.<eos> Like, deciding to take a job out of the blue or something.<eos> Okay, how about we skip the part where I try and figure out what's going on and you just tell me.<eos> I'm thinking about applying for a coaching job at the high school, and I was wondering how you'd feel about me being there with you?
No, no, not at all.<eos> I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm-I'm not, I'm not even sure I wanna do it.<eos> It doesn't hurt to apply.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> Five years ago, who would have thought we'd both end up back at RHS?<eos> It's Aria.<eos> "Doesn't seem like the best night to spend at Ezra's.<eos> Mind if I bunk with you at Lucas' loft?"
Lives like a hermit.<eos> Can you take us there?<eos> It seems like he was honing in on some of the missing.<eos> We need to find the burrow.<eos> We've been beating around the woods for two days.<eos> That's where they are.<eos> You saw the tracks.<eos> I can keep searching on my own.<eos> We're losing.<eos> Why don't I go with you?
They need you to start right away.<eos> You'll need to let Banks know.<eos> - No, I don't think I will.<eos> - He'll need to be informed.<eos> No, I mean, I won't be taking up the post.<eos> The team's been through a lot and we don't need any more changes right now.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, it seems you told David So, it seems you told David you wanted to leave your body to medical science.<eos> He says you were serious, but it sounds to me like you were a few glasses down at the time.<eos> Anyway, the point is, I don't have a place for you, nowhere that I can come and talk to you, so I chose this.
Oh, Crowley. What are you doing here?<eos> Uh, say, who was born today?<eos> Is this the Winchesters' kitchen?<eos> Uh, nobody, Hugh.<eos> Sort of.<eos> This is UTV...<eos> I come here in my mind to pass the time.<eos> For some reason, it has excellent reception.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> What has Lucifer done to you?
(exhales) Uh... CHAD: Wait, Lina, wait.<eos> Jane, I'm sorry.<eos> This is why I didn't want you at my bachelorette party.<eos> Because I knew this would happen.<eos> I knew you would act like a drunk sorority girl.<eos> Wait. That's not fair. You're right.<eos> (crying):<eos> It's not fair!<eos> You know why I'm such a control freak, Mom?<eos> Because I grew up with you, and you are so out of control!
Yep. Oh, my God...<eos> Yeah. (giggles)<eos> Oh, I'm still drunk.<eos> I know. (giggles)<eos> But can I say something? I love you so much.<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: So,I guesswe 'reback togushinglevels. And I'm not just gushing because I'm drunk,<eos> I'm gushing because...<eos> I've been having trouble with my vows.<eos> Distilling what to say. And tonight I realized it's simple.<eos> With you...
Mr. MacMillan, I'd really prefer that you run something like this...<eos> Aaron, it's fine.<eos> 60%.<eos> 70%.<eos> Come be my partner and 70% of the company is yours.<eos> Mr. Clark, my professional advice would be to seriously consider...<eos> I'd like to state for the record that this is not a legitimate offer. It's fully legitimate.<eos> I'll sign anything you put in front of me.<eos> Just say the word, Gordon.<eos> I don't want to work with you, Joe.
I know you're frustrated.<eos> I'm frustrated because this was supposed to be temporary.<eos> It is temporary.<eos> You've gone to a lot of trouble to be here.<eos> You got three minutes.<eos> I know that something's coming, and I'm terrified that I'm gonna miss it.<eos> SwapMeet is our competition, and we don't want you to help us compete with SwapMeet.<eos> We want you to help us buy them.<eos> Come meet my partner, and 70% of the company is yours.<eos> I don't wanna work with you, Joe.
You know what?<eos> I will have a gin and tonic, please.<eos> - Very well.<eos> - Thank you. Nice choice.<eos> And what's your excuse?<eos> I just like drinking at lunch.<eos> So, the official SwapMeet offer is happening today?<eos> Yes, John Bosworth is taking it over later this afternoon.<eos> - Exciting.<eos> - Yeah. Will he go over with you and Cameron?
How could I have risen from the ashes if you hadn't burned it all to the ground?<eos> Is that why you stole my best coder?<eos> Who, Ryan?<eos> Come on.<eos> The Valley is crawling with Ryans.<eos> No, actually, he's incredibly talented.<eos> Do you want him back?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Did you follow me here?<eos> No, Cam, I don't have time to follow you.
Well, we can't all have your Southern charm.<eos> I want to thank you for calling me when my grandson was born.<eos> That was you, right?<eos> Mm-hmm. Oh, sure.<eos> Joe MacMillan, man of mystery.<eos> Yeah, it's always good to hear from an old... friend.<eos> Well, you seem to be doing just fine making new friends.<eos> Oh, Miss Gould is just a business associate.<eos> Oh, no, I mean everyone here.<eos> They're lapping you up.
Maybe the big boss isn't the one taking it.<eos> Hey, Jesus Christ, Joe.<eos> We had the son of a bitch locked and you had to...<eos> Had to what?<eos> We sell security software to the government.<eos> Hey, wait.<eos> Come on, hey!<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> It was great hanging out with you last night.
You cost me lots of money.<eos> Ha ha ha!<eos> Your Russian's terrible.<eos> Your accent's American.<eos> So...<eos> What are you doing so far from home?<eos> Adam Hunt.<eos> Daniel Brickwell.<eos> Frank Bertinelli.<eos> If I were you...
Well, I'm running out of different ways to tell you that it's not.<eos> Hey, look.<eos> Being a vigilante is not just putting on a mask and thinking up a codename.<eos> These people are amateurs, Felicity.<eos> You really think that they're going to replace<eos> Dig or Thea or Laurel?<eos> They couldn't do that if I wanted them to, and I don't want them to.<eos> They're already out there, Oliver.<eos> Because of you.<eos> Inspired by you.
Because of you.<eos> Inspired by you.<eos> After what happened with Laurel, how can you ask me to put more people in the crosshairs?<eos> I am not the one who is asking, or do you not remember the promise that you made to Laurel before she died?<eos> Laurel was thinking about the future.<eos> You need to think about yours.<eos> Right now,<eos> I need to think of ways to stop Tobias Church...<eos> - Oliver. - So you let me know when you find a way around the kill cordon.<eos> Nothing ever simple with you, Oliver Queen.
How about you?<eos> You still the mayor?<eos> Yeah.<eos> They haven't voted me out yet, so...<eos> Yeah, well, give it a little bit of time, man. They'll come to their senses.<eos> I got your message.<eos> You all right?<eos> I'm all right.<eos> I--I...<eos> I wanted to bounce something off of you and get your perspective.
I'm whole, here.<eos> There's even a Flash, so I don't have to be.<eos> Yeah, who is this dashing young speedster, huh?<eos> Do you know?<eos> You even care?<eos> While you sit around and hide like a lost, lonely little boy, letting someone else risk their life to protect the city, our common enemy is coming for us both.<eos> What common enemy is that?<eos> Time.<eos> It's already screwing with you and everyone you love.<eos> And pretty soon, it's gonna take me right down along with you.
- Hey, slugger.<eos> - There's my beautiful boy.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Everything's great.<eos> - Mornin'!<eos> - Morning, Barry.<eos> Mornin'.<eos> Looks good.<eos> What is up with you?
I heard a story about how, when you were 15, your brother Dante owed a bookie and he couldn't pay back what he owed, so you gave him all the money you earned that summer delivering pizzas to help him.<eos> How do you know about that?<eos> I have a feeling that... we would work really well together as partners. Taking down meta-humans together.<eos> I mean, it's what we're supposed to do.<eos> We're a team.<eos> We're friends.<eos> I'm okay. I'm okay, I just...<eos> What was I--<eos> What was I just saying?<eos> What is going on with you?
It's like I'll be thinking of a moment from my past and then it-- it vanishes.<eos> I can't get it back.<eos> Why?<eos> Flashpoint.<eos> It's a side effect.<eos> See, I told you before.<eos> You don't know what you're doing.<eos> This new reality you've created is starting to overwrite the reality that you and I know.<eos> So your original life-- your friends, your family-- pretty soon, all of that will just fade away.<eos> Why isn't it happening to you?
Do what?<eos> Make things right.<eos> I need that.<eos> You don't need that.<eos> You do not need that.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Hey, slugger.<eos> Who's this?<eos> This is Iris.<eos> It's nice to meet you, Iris.
Still betting that horse, are we?<eos> Yeah, 'cause we're not stupid.<eos> Keep telling yourself that, dear.<eos> That dustup with the Darkness must've really taken it out of the old boy.<eos> That's why he's jumping from vessel to vessel to vessel.<eos> It's why Lucifer's running -- because he's weak.<eos> So?<eos> He'll get stronger.<eos> Lucifer will lead us to glory.<eos> As long as he's out there, Hell will never follow you.
They're made from recycled shoes.<eos> They are so dumb!<eos> I don't know who I am!<eos> I want to go back to who I was!<eos> There he is.<eos> The real Sam.<eos> Wow!<eos> What a breakthrough!<eos> Sam.<eos> It is an honor to meet you.
- That's what I'm saying.<eos> No, the neighborhood.<eos> "Vedding."<eos> Maybe that's the message.<eos> Oh, Clare, you genius.<eos> And you, Daniel Miller, well done.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah, put him through.<eos> Valerie?<eos> I got someone here who wants to talk to you.
This is our moment, Josh Chan.<eos> I'm so excited that our love story can finally begin.<eos> _<eos> Did you mean what you said?<eos> You moved here for me?<eos> Okay.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, yes, I did and I know it sounds weird, but... allow me... okay.<eos> You have to understand.<eos> When I ran into you in New York, I was at a very low moment.
Right. 'Cause your feet are sweaty.<eos> Yeah, let's look for 'em.<eos> Great, great.<eos> Actually, I'm really glad you're here.<eos> I've been wanting to talk to you about something.<eos> About socks? (chuckles)<eos> No.<eos> I think you were right about the Greg thing.<eos> It's just, I have this, um... intuition that he's not in a good place right now.<eos> So I agree with you.
- Like a date?<eos> - I'd love to.<eos> Or is it not a date?<eos> Like, um... like just the two of us?<eos> I hope not, for Maria Semple's sake.<eos> Not that funny.<eos> I just meant, like, did you want to pick me up,<eos> - or should we just meet there?<eos> - No.<eos> I'll pick you up at 7:00.
Keep her paralyzed?<eos> Take care of her.<eos> Talk to her so she won't be so lonely.<eos> That sounds like a great idea.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, for everything.<eos> Without you, I would've... broken down.<eos> Today.<eos> Last night.<eos> Yeah, um, I actually wanted to talk to you about last night.
Good.<eos> You should be arrested.<eos> I gave you guys my urine!<eos> And then you make this egregious racial and generational mistake!<eos> I hope you rot in jail.<eos> Did I hear something about a urine exchange?<eos> _<eos> Thank you for your help.<eos> A day like this, it just puts things in perspective.<eos> So I wanted to say on the other note, that, of course, I'll stand by you
Did I hear something about a urine exchange?<eos> _<eos> Thank you for your help.<eos> A day like this, it just puts things in perspective.<eos> So I wanted to say on the other note, that, of course, I'll stand by you<eos> - and the baby.<eos> - Rogelio.<eos> Stop.<eos> I'm not having the baby.<eos> I didn't want to have a baby with you, who I love so much.
Everything okay?<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> Damon.<eos> Stefan.<eos> Hello, brother.<eos> What is all this?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Daily chores.<eos> What was in that vault, Damon?<eos> What has ahold of you?
Maybe tomorrow will be better.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Bad day?<eos> So, I've been thinking.<eos> You alone in this big house.<eos> I wonder if maybe... you'd like someone else to fill it.<eos> That someone would be me, by the way.<eos> Living here.<eos> With you.
It was nice.<eos> So, are you two seeing each other now?<eos> I'm hoping he keeps me company in Max's absence.<eos> Look, I'd prefer it if you stayed away from Hector.<eos> You'd prefer it?<eos> Okay I'll be honest.<eos> Hector's gotten himself into some deep shit, the kind of shit you don't get out of.<eos> - What kind of shit? - I...<eos> Specifically?<eos> Why are you being so difficult?
Do you know who I am?<eos> El Oso.<eos> Listen, you get me a lead on Zamacona, and we will run it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, I got to go.<eos> Bye.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi, darling.<eos> I know you're busy, but is Richard here?<eos> No. I thought he was at dinner with you.
There we go.<eos> There we go. 7th and 53rd.<eos> That's the parking garage across from the restaurant where we were supposed to meet an hour ago.<eos> Uh, you know what? Just give me a second.<eos> Hi, uh, this is Captain Beckett.<eos> I need a unit at 53rd and 7th.<eos> I saw you on the news.<eos> You're working with the Federales to investigate Zane Cannon's death.<eos> You mean his murder.<eos> Well, I mean, uh, we know that Zane, uh, was in contact with you about a business proposition and that you were in contact with him just hours before his un-untimely demise.
- So what happened?<eos> - I said no.<eos> He may be big box office, but the man cannot act.<eos> He got upstaged by a CGI aardvark in that película De fantasía.<eos> So I-I made him an ultimatum.<eos> You're the one who made him drop "Safe Word" and do "Hamlet."<eos> I needed to see that he was serious.<eos> That he really could act.<eos> So I told him if he got a good review in the Times, my life rights were his.<eos> But he had contact with you before the show premiered.
With your brother dead, the life rights would revert to you.<eos> I could care less about the El Oso biopic.<eos> I told him he could direct it for all I cared.<eos> Wait, you... you told Zane he could star in and direct his dream project?<eos> Only I guess Zane had already promised the job to someone else...<eos> Someone who would not be happy to lose it.<eos> O, woe is me.<eos> T'have seen what I have seen...<eos> No. Y-You've got to feel it more.<eos> This isn't just some guy who broke up with you on Snapchat.
I picture you like this... during the day, sometimes.<eos> I close my eyes, and I see you here in this room.<eos> This is the only place where the world just... stops for me.<eos> Five minutes.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I didn't...<eos> Were you waiting for me?<eos> I-I had a break in my schedule, so...<eos> I've been so busy the last couple of weeks, I haven't seen you.
I don't know what else to say.<eos> I'm all right.<eos> It's not my blood.<eos> The transport's ready.<eos> All right, I'm not...<eos> It's not my blood.<eos> Daliyah...<eos> Hey. They want to take me to the hospital.<eos> It's okay. It's okay.<eos> I'll come with you.
Excuse me?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Shit.<eos> You're sleeping with Professor El-Amin.<eos> Sammy, he was here because he's been writing blogs about me being responsible for the violence in Abuddin.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> Yes.<eos> That's who you choose to sleep with?<eos> You know what, I changed my mind.<eos> I don't want to talk about this with you.
Things have changed.<eos> Have they?<eos> We'll see.<eos> If you're not going to torture me or kill me, may I go home to my children?<eos> They will be home from school soon.<eos> My apologies for the blindfold.<eos> You understand my precaution.<eos> Your brother-in-law didn't say why you wanted to see me.<eos> I didn't tell him.<eos> I wanted to talk to you myself.
I want you to stay.<eos> Stay?<eos> I had no idea you could quote Shakespeare.<eos> I went to school through the third grade but I taught myself to read.<eos> I learned everything I could.<eos> First, every book I could find, and then online.<eos> You're like Abraham Lincoln.<eos> Who?<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> I'm proud of you.
Peace be upon you.<eos> -Where's Mom?<eos> She's uh...<eos> She's not coming.<eos> Where were you this morning?<eos> I couldn't find you.<eos> At the university.<eos> By yourself?<eos> Sammy, do you have any idea how dangerous that is?<eos> What's wrong with you?
Leave me be.<eos> Can I?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Is he dead?<eos> We don't know yet.<eos> I'm sorry, Sammy.<eos> About what?<eos> Everything.<eos> Not being there for Emma.<eos> Not being here for you or your mom.
Barry, it's not safe for me.<eos> I've come so close to...<eos> I don't trust myself.<eos> I need to go get better.<eos> You can get better here.<eos> With us.<eos> I can't.<eos> It's too hard.<eos> I keep looking out the window, thinking I'm, um, gonna see the person I used to be walking by.<eos> I've been working too much, haven't been here for you.
Now, I may be the heir To my friend, Bassam's, revolution, But I'm not his twin.<eos> And on this we disagree.<eos> And my administration will reflect that.<eos> Truth.<eos> Reconciliation.<eos> Those powerful words ring hollow now.<eos> He's winning.<eos> He doesn't need to say these things.<eos> What?<eos> He is allowed to disagree with you.
What student union wouldn't speak out against that?<eos> Even in America.<eos> 30% of us are Islamists, but we have no voice here.<eos> Halima Nair's been hypnotized by her American-style crush on our American-style President.<eos> This isn't your meeting, Hanif!<eos> I'm exercising my right to speak.<eos> We start in five minutes.<eos> You can wait your turn.<eos> Turn?<eos> You don't let anyone talk anymore Unless you agree with you.
Tell me how else I should interpret it.<eos> I never want to hurt you.<eos> Never.<eos> -Bullshit.<eos> You're lying.<eos> You're always lying.<eos> I'm not. I'm not lying.<eos> I'm not trying to betray you.<eos> I'm not your enemy.<eos> I just disagree with you.
I never want to hurt you.<eos> Never.<eos> -Bullshit.<eos> You're lying.<eos> You're always lying.<eos> I'm not. I'm not lying.<eos> I'm not trying to betray you.<eos> I'm not your enemy.<eos> I just disagree with you.<eos> Not everyone who disagrees with you is a traitor.
I'm not your enemy.<eos> I just disagree with you.<eos> Not everyone who disagrees with you is a traitor.<eos> He embraced my daughter's murderer And you made him a partner.<eos> Get out.<eos> I never want to see your face again.<eos> Get out.<eos> No, you can't do that.<eos> You may be angry, but you can't walk away from me.<eos> We're connected, you and I.
Right, of course.<eos> General?<eos> I need to know if we're ready to send our army into Syria.<eos> Sir, are you asking me if we're prepared to go to war today?<eos> That's what I'm asking.<eos> Yes.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm tired of waiting.<eos> We need Ihab to give us an excuse, any reason to march, and when it comes, we move.<eos> I have news I wanted to share with you.
Okay.<eos> I volunteered to become a martyr.<eos> To bring jihad to their backyard.<eos> It's a great honor.<eos> To-to be a martyr.<eos> To go to paradise for our cause.<eos> I know.<eos> I hope to meet you there someday.<eos> That would be nice.<eos> Since we weren't destined to share a path in this world, I would like to see you in the next.
Good-bye, dearest.<eos> Last time.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Why?<eos> For what?<eos> For wanting to die.<eos> You don't have to apologize.<eos> Everyone understands.<eos> - No, I do.<eos> I owe you an apology, you.
Whatever you have to say to me, you should be saying to the whole country.<eos> This is not between you and me.<eos> It is, between you and me.<eos> You have to stop speaking out against me.<eos> Daliyah.<eos> You have no right to ask me that.<eos> - Daliyah, this is me.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Do I owe you something?<eos> Because I slept with you?
You're under arrest.<eos> What?<eos> Guards.<eos> Take this woman into custody.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You couldn't do it, that's what matters.<eos> No.<eos> You and I... ..we're more the same than different, Nafisa.<eos> That's why I fell in love with you.<eos> That's why I stayed with you.
not entirely sure.<eos> Just a feeling that i have.<eos> And this feeling is worth Creating a panic with my counselors?<eos> All due respect, ms. Carpenter,<eos> I'd rather speak up and be wrong than say nothing and be right.<eos> So, what happened to amy last night?<eos> Why'd she just run off?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She, uh -- she got freaked out.<eos> If i was alone with you, i'd run home, too.
We owe him everything.<eos> Wendy Xiao.<eos> Robbery, illegal gambling, all sorts.<eos> Xun Li had two gangs in his sights, both of them linked to you.<eos> A heater in one of Xun's flats was faulty and one of the tenants got carbon monoxide poisoning.<eos> Where were you on Sunday night?<eos> I thought you might find it useful to get a few pointers for when you sit the DCI board.<eos> - You asked to see me.<eos> - That was a mistake.<eos> Why would the wife of a villain like Richards want to see you?
Maybe she was made to by the person who really did it.<eos> - Did you see who was driving the car?<eos> - No. Could it have been the same man who trashed your flat after Damon was killed?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Although...<eos> - What?<eos> .. he was outside my flat the night Kat died.<eos> She said that he'd followed her there.<eos> - She was pretty freaked out.<eos> - So, Kat was with you?
- I'll look after you, Ken.<eos> Get rashes, like, shortness of breath.<eos> Not to mention the smell.<eos> Lydia won't speak to me for a week.<eos> According to our site manager, the load we're looking for is over there in area number three.<eos> What, no overalls for you, boss?<eos> Alas, a mountain of paperwork with my name on awaits.<eos> One of the burdens of office, I'm afraid.<eos> Tough at the top.<eos> I'll be with you in spirit, Ken.
I will say exactly that, okay?<eos> - All right.<eos> Well, thanks, Ricardo, I appreciate it.<eos> - Oh, hey, you did a lot for me as a kid.<eos> - I did?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, even as a grown-up, I never found a friend that did for me what you did.<eos> Yeah, we were kids, but you stuck up for me.<eos> You know. I was sad when you went away.<eos> And when I heard you got out, I came around a lot to try and catch up with you, you know.
Remind me, why am I doing this?<eos> Because I saved your ass in Marrakesh.<eos> Uh, I let you save my ass, old man, so that you could impress little miss naughty-knickers, who you had a crush on.<eos> You know, for a couple of ex-spies, you sound a lot like sorority girls at spring break.<eos> Hayley, this is Marcus.<eos> He's going in with you.
What are you saying?<eos> That it would appear they have teamed up once again to have their retribution.<eos> - You're wrong.<eos> - Am I, Mr. Castle?<eos> Then, tell me, why has Hayley suddenly disappeared?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> They showed me proof you were dead.<eos> No.<eos> I just wished I was.<eos> What did they do to you?
Well, that's the question everyone's been asking since 1882... when my great-grandfather first managed to open it.<eos> Dalton...<eos> Who's there?<eos> Dalton.<eos> Show yourself.<eos> What's in there?<eos> What's in there?<eos> It's not a what.<eos> It's not a who.<eos> It's what it does to you.
No, you're not.<eos> You're nowhere near done.<eos> I'm staring at a floor covered in names.<eos> And I'll kill every last one of them.<eos> Just come home.<eos> What?<eos> I don't want our last moments to be like this.<eos> You a million miles away.<eos> Connected only by some crappy cell phone signal.<eos> Whatever time I have left, I want to spend it with you.
Killing.<eos> Rayna.<eos> They're killing them.<eos> Good news, brother.<eos> You can pack up your implements of destruction and punch your time card.<eos> Every box in Rayna's list will be checked by tonight.<eos> Well, it looks like you pulled it off.<eos> That's got to tip the scales in your favor with Bonnie.<eos> It's a little more complicated than that.<eos> Well, with you, it usually is.
Bonfire, check.<eos> Last descendant of the tribe that created you... by the way, thank you for that... check. Bonnie's O-neg, check.<eos> It is a great honor to meet you, Rayna.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Look, we're in a bit of a hurry here, okay?<eos> So if you can get on with the shamaning...<eos> Hear me, Great Spirit.<eos> Hear me.<eos> We call upon you in this moment of need.<eos> One has come before you.
When she wakes up, we do not know what she's going to be or how she's going to feel.<eos> And if we chain her up, we've made that decision for her.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> No chains.<eos> But then I'm not leaving.<eos> Ric.<eos> The flight's in an hour.<eos> It's the last flight out tonight, and Lizzie and Josie have been stuck with a sitter for two days now.<eos> I know, but if this goes the wrong way, I'm the one person Bonnie's not gonna want to kill on sight, okay?<eos> I should be here with you.
Oh, how ironic, considering that the only reason I'm even here is that you decided to go all caveman and kidnapped me against my will.<eos> This is not you.<eos> You usually respect people's choices.<eos> Yeah, until it comes to life and death, and then it's not up for discussion.<eos> There's always a choice.<eos> You gave Elena that choice. And then I lost her.<eos> Elena asked me to rescue her friend from the bottom of a river instead of her, and she died because I respected her damn choice.<eos> Well, maybe one day you'll wake up and realize that I deserve the same respect that she did.<eos> But I stopped waiting for that day a long time ago.<eos> Whatever I decide to do about Bonnie is a decision that I'm going to make by myself or with my family, but not you.
But I stopped waiting for that day a long time ago.<eos> Whatever I decide to do about Bonnie is a decision that I'm going to make by myself or with my family, but not you.<eos> Caroline, listen to me.<eos> When you bring your family into this, you're putting them in danger too.<eos> And if I leave them behind, then I'm abandoning them, which is just as bad.<eos> Maybe even worse.<eos> Where'd you run off to?<eos> Got Caroline out of town.<eos> Huh, guess that's progress.<eos> Honestly, I'm surprised she went anywhere with you.
Believe me, I've been there.<eos> You think?<eos> I am in the exact same situation that you were in three years ago, and now that I finally understand how you felt, I'm even more furious with you, because I know what a huge decision you had to make, and you made it without me.<eos> Look.<eos> When I went to go find you in Dallas, here's what I saw... I saw you and Ric and the kids, and you were happy.<eos> You know what I didn't see?<eos> Me.<eos> So, I convinced myself that I was doing right by you, even though I had no idea what I was doing.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> And you have every right to hate me for what I did to you three years ago.
All I can do is say that I'm sorry and hope that you'll forgive me one day.<eos> I just don't think that I can do that.<eos> Bonnie?<eos> Caroline, I can see you. I can feel you.<eos> You're marked and I know exactly where you are.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You're alive.<eos> No, it's not okay.<eos> I'm not in control.<eos> I'm gonna come for you.
Come home, Caroline.<eos> - We'll deal with this.<eos> - How?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We just will.<eos> We'll... we'll run.<eos> Together, as a family.<eos> No.<eos> If anything ever happened to the girls,<eos> - or you...
I'm gonna kill you.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> You know why I brought you to this stupid stump?<eos> Because if I have to die,<eos> I wanted it to be here, Bonnie.<eos> In honor of you.<eos> Stop doing this.<eos> I hate you. I get it.<eos> The Bonnie that I knew yesterday is gone, and she may never come back.<eos> But I'm talking to you, crazy bitch Bonnie in all her glory.
A witch, a human, a ghost, a corpse.<eos> An anchor to the afterlife, and now, the woman who's gonna kill me.<eos> And every time, you come back stronger.<eos> Do you know how incredible that is, Bonnie?<eos> Do you know how much I envy you?<eos> Hell, some days I can't even handle just being myself.<eos> Stop... talking. I can't.<eos> Because if this is my last moment with you, Bonnie Bennett,<eos> I need you to hear me.<eos> I admire you.
And I love you the same way Elena loved you.<eos> If you kill me right now, it's not your fault.<eos> I did this to us.<eos> But please... forgive me before you do what you have to do.<eos> Okay?<eos> I gotta hand it to you, Sheriff.<eos> You're a better shot than Liz Forbes ever was.<eos> May she rest in peace.<eos> Those shots bought us eight hours to get Bonnie as far away from the rest of you as I can.<eos> I don't want to waste a second of it talking to you.
I'm on it.<eos> Perhaps once it's less ambiguous, it will be less terrifying.<eos> Guys, it doesn't matter.<eos> Bonnie sealed the whole Armory.<eos> You can't get in.<eos> Don't tell me what I can't do.<eos> I can't get in.<eos> Plan B.<eos> Stefan, call your ex.<eos> Obviously, not the one next to you.
Don't you leave me, Bonnie.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Bonnie!<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm hurt and I need help.<eos> Is anyone out there?<eos> Well, you're awfully quiet.<eos> Don't tell me you're still mad about the pilot.<eos> Caroline's bringing her kids, and we're gonna get inside, and that's all that matters.<eos> What happened to you, hmm?
It was because you were afraid if you didn't, you would do something terrible, and you would lose her forever.<eos> And that fear, that fear was so powerful that it overrode any love that you felt for me or Bonnie or anybody else.<eos> It wasn't about you, Stefan.<eos> Oh, it had absolutely everything to do with me.<eos> No.<eos> I looked you in the eyes, Damon, and I begged you to stay.<eos> And you turned your back on me like it was nothing.<eos> And I thought about that yesterday, when I "Pulled a Damon." And I realized... I never want to be that person.<eos> I refuse to be ruled by fear.<eos> I refuse to be you.
I know.<eos> I know.<eos> You're a terrible shot.<eos> We established that years ago.<eos> How the hell did you get yourself into this one?<eos> I just can't escape this life.<eos> That's the thing, Matt.<eos> You haven't really tried.<eos> So what do you want to do?<eos> I just want to be with you.

She's my family.<eos> I can't - - I don't want to see her dead, but...<eos> Yeah?<eos> ...I understand.<eos> Dean.<eos> Cass.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> I could go with you.
Turns out bankers want you to look businesslike when you ask them to loan you large sums of money.<eos> I might be buying the Fairwick.<eos> What?<eos> Really?<eos> I can just scrape together enough.<eos> It's a good investment, you know, long-term.<eos> Well, I hope it works out.<eos> And if you need an extra couple hundred bucks...<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll head up with you.
What?<eos> Oh, my God, I lost track of time.<eos> Is it 1:00?<eos> - Sure is.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Good.<eos> Uh, he's napping,<eos> - so I'll just go wake him.<eos> - Uh, wait, real quick.<eos> I just need to talk to you about something.
Deep breaths.<eos> What does it say?<eos> Jane, what does it say?<eos> I'm back in the program.<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> Ooh, yes!<eos> Well, you know what they say.<eos> Those who can't salsa dance, write about salsa dancers.<eos> I'm so proud of you.
Detective Reagan.<eos> This is Detective...<eos> Mosley. Mosley.<eos> How you holding up, champ?<eos> I might've been better off going another 12 rounds instead.<eos> Yeah, you got that right.<eos> I don't got much.<eos> Well, just be straight with us.<eos> We'll be the judge of what you got.<eos> We heard from some witnesses that there was a beef at the club between you and some guys.
Well, she's not wearing it in the photo, but she definitely has a piercing.<eos> That's our girl.<eos> That's not enough to go on.<eos> That's all we got.<eos> It'll have to do.<eos> Last known address is in Fort Greene.<eos> You think John Bell and his crew will be there?<eos> We're gonna sit on her house until we find out.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Did she talk to you about us?
I guess I can be a little late.<eos> Karma, no, don't worry.<eos> Sabrina lives here now, so you will have plenty of one-on-one time with her too.<eos> That's exactly what I wanted!<eos> - Ugh! - Here, let me.<eos> I almost had it.<eos> Yeah, I know, but I'm happy to help, since I'm here.<eos> Speaking of which, how much longer can I stay?<eos> 'Cause I can be even more helpful if you like.<eos> I'm not having sex with you.
Well, man, I really wasn't prepared for this, but since you asked, I guess I'd say, well, I hate the name.<eos> And if I'm being honest, your sound is a little cliché and derivative.<eos> Oh, you want to hear something cliché and derivative?<eos> Go (BLEEP) yourself!<eos> Hey, Sabrina.<eos> Uh, I wanted to apologize.<eos> I thought I'd moved on, but being with you brought up some old memories from camp.<eos> You know, when you bullied me behind Amy's back.<eos> But that was a million years ago, and I forgive you, so I hope we can be friends, for real this time.<eos> I bullied you?
I can handle Amy having another friend, because I know no one will ever have the connection we do.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'll never connect with Amy the same way you do.<eos> But that doesn't mean you two can't be friends.<eos> So why don't you and I call a truce, for Amy's sake?<eos> Truce.<eos> I'm pretty sure "go (BLEEP) yourself"<eos> means we're done talking.<eos> Listen, I want to apologize for real this time.<eos> I was just messing with you.
Oh, mazel tov.<eos> I've always thought that I was straight, and now I'm starting to think that maybe I'm not.<eos> I'm here for you.<eos> Karma, it's late.<eos> If this another attempt to make me a Belieber...<eos> No, even though he is a legitimate musician.<eos> Um, that's not why I'm here.<eos> Seeing how close you and Sabrina were tonight at game night, it drove me a little crazy.<eos> And I think I finally realize why.<eos> No. No, I cannot go back there with you.
Get your diversity on!<eos> You haven't buttoned up yet?<eos> It's not rocket science.<eos> You like guys.<eos> You like girls.<eos> Just (BLEEP) pick "bisexual" so we can have Christmas!<eos> That might be the strangest thing I've ever heard anyone say.<eos> Ugh. Excuse me.<eos> You're not the only one I have to yell at right now.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
I can't believe you let that girl sucker-punch you.<eos> You know what?<eos> I get why she did it.<eos> She came here to fight for the person that she loves.<eos> I wish somebody would fight for me like that.<eos> Mmm...<eos> Um... uh, Gabi... uh...<eos> When you want somebody, you just know it.<eos> You know. How hard is it to say "I want you.<eos> I want to be with you."

It was a lovely thought.<eos> And did you got the biscuits?<eos> A-And the sweater?<eos> I-I know how drafty these rooms are.<eos> - Mr. Penguin.<eos> - Oswald.<eos> When I think of how I treated you...<eos> Stop.<eos> Why are you being so kind?<eos> Talking to you these past months, I don't know how I would've gotten by otherwise.
That's all right.<eos> James Gordon.<eos> Hands where I can see them.<eos> So, what?<eos> You're here to collect the bounty Penguin has over my head?<eos> What is it, a million dollars?<eos> And to think I let that punk live.<eos> Well, then, I think you better cuff me.<eos> Cuff yourself.<eos> How many others you have with you?
She was kind to me.<eos> But then she met him.<eos> That boy.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> - You know me?<eos> - Uh, yeah.<eos> I know Bruce Wayne.<eos> Who is he?<eos> Who is he?<eos> What's wrong with you?
Pew, pew, pew, pew.<eos> Carol, I'm sure you're very fertile.<eos> I mean, you have so many periods.<eos> I do.<eos> I'm the problem here.<eos> You're never the problem.<eos> I mean, you are the problem, sometimes, but not in this, okay?<eos> Listen, Skid, I did not marry you so we could have a baby together.<eos> I did the first time, but not the second time, okay?<eos> I married you 'cause I want to be with you.
I know you did.<eos> I really care about him, too.<eos> Shall we get this party started?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Lucky shot.<eos> You know, you wouldn't think it, but your brother is a very gifted lover.<eos> Well, it must have been all that practice with the neighborhood dogs.<eos> Mike!<eos> You are incorrigible.<eos> Carol, it's been an absolute delight getting to know you.
- It's very important.<eos> Any information you can give us.<eos> Look, unless you have a warrant...<eos> Hey.<eos> You're that president's daughter.<eos> She looks like me.<eos> Apparently, Hector asked Anna out a few times and she said no.<eos> Well, Hector's not big on "no."<eos> He's got a temper.<eos> Cindy, did Hector get violent with you?

Yes, I'm an agnostic myself, but I have prayed, many times, to God, to turn my wife into a pillar of salt. Well, He came close.

No, Sandra.<eos> Scott wasn't part of the plan.<eos> He was just assigned with me on kitchen duty.<eos> He requested that assignment.<eos> So what?<eos> How'd you meet Sandra?<eos> Well... Scott introduced us.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Yeah, well, that was, like, two years ago.<eos> He's been playing you.
I don't feel like that's an appropriate way to speak about a client.<eos> You'll get over it.<eos> Have you heard from Laurel?<eos> Yeah. She's at her grandmother's funeral.<eos> No, she's not.<eos> I sent her to see her father.<eos> Why?<eos> I thought I was meeting you upstairs.<eos> I couldn't wait.<eos> Let me look at you.
I think we should plea out.<eos> You've been begging me for weeks to take a real case, and now you want to quit?<eos> No one will blame you for cutting a deal on this one, and it will help keep the President out of your hair.<eos> The President can suck it.<eos> Annalise.<eos> I'll talk to the D.A.<eos> Just go and make sure our client is not trying to purchase Michaela.<eos> Please, please, please, please don't show her.<eos> Look, I'll do whatever you want.<eos> I'll have sex with you.
I can decide who I want in my life, so no more spying on me.<eos> No more bugging my phone.<eos> I wouldn't need to if you'd just return my calls.<eos> Listen.<eos> I know why you're angry.<eos> I understand.<eos> I never saw you, not this person you've become.<eos> I see her now.<eos> You've taken everything you've been through, all the pain, and you turned it into strength.<eos> And for that, I am proud of you.

She's gonna have it in jail, and then what?<eos> Who's gonna take care of it?<eos> No one.<eos> It's gonna grow up just like me... with no family.<eos> You're both horrible people.<eos> Blame me.<eos> None of this is on you.<eos> No, I...<eos> I don't blame you.<eos> I'm proud of you.

Did you come all the way here just to tell us that you got laid?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Why?<eos> Is that weird?<eos> It's not weird.<eos> It just didn't happen.<eos> Yeah, fine.<eos> I made Heidi up, but I did it to prove a point. Ah.<eos> I got that part.<eos> Who are you?
You're not my woman.<eos> You're my family.<eos> What?<eos> Not in the gross sister way.<eos> I...<eos> I lost my family -- all of them.<eos> I never had a family.<eos> It's not that big a deal.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I'm not talking about this with you.

Frank was never there.<eos> It's smart.<eos> It protects Frank, too.<eos> You think I want to protect Frank?<eos> Don't you?<eos> No.<eos> You knew where he was, and you didn't tell me.<eos> Who am I here with right now, Wes?<eos> You, not Frank.
- I don't believe you.<eos> - Well, that's your right.<eos> He's responsible for you losing your baby.<eos> And you killed Sam!<eos> I'm tired.<eos> So am I.<eos> How's Laurel?<eos> Did she tell you?<eos> She didn't need to.<eos> I'm glad you have her.
To be wrongfully imprisoned.<eos> Just the news.<eos> Let's eat.<eos> What?<eos> If I hacked your laptop, would I find out that you're actually reading about Wes' court case?<eos> Did you not hear me when I said that I wanted to stay in the bubble?<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> I just don't believe you.<eos> Come on, like you all aren't hiding a ton of crap from me.<eos> I've always been honest with you about how there are certain things I can't tell you for your own protection.
- Don't be.<eos> Today was a good day.<eos> And tomorrow?<eos> Let's not think about that.<eos> Come here.<eos> I've got you.<eos> What?<eos> You're always looking out for me.<eos> Now it's my turn.<eos> I got you.
It's what she wants.<eos> - It's not.<eos> - It is.<eos> She knows this was Sam.<eos> Sam didn't kill anyone.<eos> It was you!<eos> Do any of us want to live in a society that doesn't allow second chances? No.<eos> Let us dedicate our energy to caring for this man instead of killing him.<eos> - I need you here, Frank.<eos> - She's playing you!
Previously on "DARK MATTER"...<eos> Something really bad happened to you there.
Do you know where they're located?<eos> I know what, i know where, and I know how.<eos> Eric's coworkers were happy to help.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey.<eos> It's all right.<eos> What'd they do to you?
Right.<eos> Hey, listen, I need to talk to you about Three.<eos> What about him?<eos> He's not himself.<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you doing down here?<eos> Let's get him to the infirmary.<eos> What the hell is going on here?<eos> You tell us.<eos> What did Rook do to you?
You tell us.<eos> What did Rook do to you?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> What did he tell you?<eos> He's betrayed us once.<eos> He can't be trusted.<eos> He's not the one I'm worried about.<eos> Strange.<eos> Although he's awake, his neural activity is consistent with rem sleep.<eos> Something happened to you in Rook's lab.
Really great.<eos> Our date was magical.<eos> Maybe for you, but I know Ryan is falling for me.<eos> I'm sorry, can you turn this off?<eos> Or just throw the TV out?<eos> John, but Gigi doesn't...<eos> Who actually watches this show?<eos> I just want to spend all of my time with him.<eos> God, you're sounding very needy.<eos> Maybe that's why he's not into you.
Let's go.<eos> We don't need to be here.<eos> Why don't you tell me what you want to talk about?<eos> Cat got your tongue?<eos> They went in through the downstairs entrance.<eos> I got no video.<eos> All right, we do, but it's just a brick wall.<eos> - We still have audio.<eos> - You know, Charisse?<eos> I tried to look out for you on the inside.
I mean, but you do it because you know, there's always, you know, some potential.<eos> I mean, some days are okay, and even if they're not, then, you know, you know you can have an okay one.<eos> Or maybe even a great day.<eos> So you're sort of, you know, just biding your time to see what happens next.<eos> See what life offers.<eos> Maybe hit the lottery.<eos> Meet someone special.<eos> Maybe the Mets will win the playoffs, or if they make it into the playoffs.<eos> You know, or, like, looking forward to Easter this year.<eos> I... I like talking to you.
Thanks for coming down.<eos> Do you know how many cops I actually come down to the precinct to see?<eos> If it was any more than me, I'd be jealous.<eos> What do you got?<eos> Hopefully now you can stop calling my cell phone every five minutes.<eos> Were you able to I.D. the bone fragments from the boat explosion?<eos> The remains belong to Wilder's mother.<eos> That sick son of a bitch blows up his own mother.<eos> I think that'd be obvious.<eos> He did it because he thought she cooperated with you.
What happened?<eos> What, is she alive?<eos> She's alive, she's alive.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> He called from her phone, which means TARU can track it.<eos> I got to get this phone to them right away.<eos> Okay, let me know what you get.<eos> You got it.<eos> Hey, where you going?<eos> I'm going with you.
Okay, let me know what you get.<eos> You got it.<eos> Hey, where you going?<eos> I'm going with you.<eos> You can't come with me.<eos> What else am I supposed to do, Danny?<eos> Copy that.<eos> They traced Nicky's phone to Beach Channel Road.<eos> That's Wilder's car.<eos> You got your gun on you? Yeah, I got it.
(Sighs)<eos> Is that Christy?<eos> Hi, Christy.<eos> Um... hi, voice.<eos> Adam, I gotta call you back.<eos> You better.<eos> I mean, hey, you do whatever you want.<eos> What was that about?<eos> Wrong number.<eos> What happened to you?
I don't have to like you, I just have to help you.<eos> Before my stepfather adopted me, I was Joan Yun.<eos> Why don't you just admit you're my half sister?<eos> Running away won't work.<eos> I'm a detective, I'll just find you again.<eos> I've got nothing to say to you.<eos> Okay, Sherlock and I just helped you out with a really big problem; the least you could do is tell me how long you've known I exist.<eos> Two years.<eos> But you never called me, you never came to see me.<eos> Because I never wanted to have this conversation with you.
Five years after he left, he came back.<eos> My mom, to her credit, told him to get lost, to go back to his first family.<eos> But he said he couldn't.<eos> He said that you and your brother and your mom had replaced him.<eos> You weren't even using his last name.<eos> You were ashamed of it, ashamed of him.<eos> And he hated you for it.<eos> And I mean hated, Joan.<eos> He wished you were all dead.<eos> And now that I've met you, I get it.
- No, no, no, no -- more like that.<eos> That? !<eos> This, eh?<eos> Yes?<eos> - Yeah. - Ohh!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on, fuckhead!<eos> Yeah, you fuckin'...<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
Shirl... look, you really need to focus now, OK?<eos> Is Liechtenstein it?<eos> Qi and I have been going over the numbers again.<eos> We might be weak on the Honduras Petroleum Alliance as well.<eos> You don't want Honduras.<eos> We don't want Honduras.<eos> OK.<eos> - OK.<eos> Thank you, Qi.<eos> - I'm watching you, Cleaver.
Qi and I have been going over the numbers again.<eos> We might be weak on the Honduras Petroleum Alliance as well.<eos> You don't want Honduras.<eos> We don't want Honduras.<eos> OK.<eos> - OK.<eos> Thank you, Qi.<eos> - I'm watching you, Cleaver.<eos> My dad was a vivisectionist.<eos> And you.
You didn't drop by to give me advice or see where I work.<eos> CIU is very high-profile.<eos> Jackson insisted that a visit would be a good campaign photo op.<eos> So he made sure the press were outside when you came by.<eos> I also wanted to see your office.<eos> This job is an exciting opportunity, Hayes.<eos> It will be great for your poll numbers.<eos> I meant for you.<eos> You're in charge here, doing important work.<eos> I'm so proud of you.
One, two, three?<eos> How many married men was it, Zadie?<eos> I wouldn't have picked the Prospect 3 case because Wallace prosecuted it.<eos> He's the sitting D.A. He set up the unit.<eos> Hayes didn't care, and two innocent men got out of jail.<eos> You're not confirming the rumor, are you?<eos> No.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Hayes Morrison doesn't deserve to run the CIU.<eos> Wallace doesn't agree with you.
They are beautiful!<eos> Go see them if you want.<eos> Not well.<eos> Let's go?<eos> What a pity!<eos> Surely you see the photo.<eos> Tell them it's a joke!<eos> I do not care.<eos> Come on!<eos> They are making fun of you.
He does not want to get myself.<eos> If you had seen what they did.<eos> A parent who does not protect his son is not a parent.<eos> Good Morning.<eos> This is for me?<eos> One year we're together.<eos> We must celebrate.<eos> What's going on?<eos> They're quiet today!<eos> It nathan, what happened to you?
A parent who does not protect his son is not a parent.<eos> Good Morning.<eos> This is for me?<eos> One year we're together.<eos> We must celebrate.<eos> What's going on?<eos> They're quiet today!<eos> It nathan, what happened to you?<eos> He fell, ma'am.<eos> Nathan... what happened to you?
I do not know...<eos> When a coin is thrown, it might fall face, or you might fall cross.<eos> We say that the probability of heads or tails, is the half.<eos> Get toss, it's a problem.<eos> Are not you going to lunch?<eos> When I was your age, I spent hours alone in the classroom.<eos> Sometimes I feel I'm living that feeling again.<eos> Hopefully never passes for that, Nathan.<eos> You're the one who's right.<eos> - Are you all right, Catherine?
Kiss Me.<eos> Check it out!<eos> ¡Vamos, relaxation!<eos> Get out of here.<eos> There's nothing to see!<eos> What's going on with you?<eos> The Times change.<eos> I'm not scared ...<eos> What if I kiss you now, in front of everyone?<eos> - What's wrong with you?
I went to forums to inform me!<eos> That is all!<eos> And gay porn sites?<eos> Also out of curiosity?<eos> - I only went once!<eos> - You're lying, Louis!<eos> We have reviewed your history.<eos> I do not understand.<eos> What about Laura?<eos> I'm talking to you, Louis!
I'll let you know.<eos> Let's move on!<eos> I am sorry!<eos> Here we were!<eos> Its over there!<eos> Louis!<eos> Do not do that!<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> Stay away!<eos> Louis, I just want to talk to you!
You know, I will return to the boxing tournament.<eos> Excellent...<eos> You're going to be there?<eos> I do not know...<eos> So is it true ? , Do you think I'm beautiful?<eos> Very beautiful.<eos> Pity I'm not bisexual!<eos> You are a bastard!<eos> Are you there?<eos> I need to go, but we will contact you later.
Here it is.<eos> I missed you.<eos> I can not believe that!<eos> I can believe that!<eos> I think they are lovely.<eos> What's going on?<eos> - Where is your son?<eos> - He's coming. - We are ready.<eos> - What will we do?<eos> It is not Louis with you?
You weren't gonna share it with me?<eos> The person I told this morning wasn't exactly supportive, so...<eos> And how was your breakfast this morning?<eos> It went really well.<eos> I can tell that's 100% not true.<eos> Okay, are you two, like, legit fighting?<eos> No, it's fine. It's just...<eos> Audrey has some unflattering opinions about my dad, that's all.<eos> No, they're memories, not opinions.<eos> And, sometimes, maybe people are going through big things that have absolutely nothing to do with you, Emma.
- ♪ ...want you so much ♪ - Help!<eos> (PHONE VIBRATING)<eos> You should be a better partner, Audrey.<eos> - I'm doing all the work.<eos> - Just tell me what you want.<eos> I want you to finally have some answers, killer.<eos> They're waiting for you back at Crescent Palms.<eos> No. (SCOFFS) No, I'm not going anywhere, you freak.<eos> If you don't go now, the video of you playing with Jake's mangled body gets posted in the comments of your friend's podcast.<eos> It's up to you.
Lynne Lambert.<eos> I live right next to the Morellis.<eos> Neeny, hurry!<eos> Come on.<eos> It's 'cause she thinks we're the dumb ones.<eos> Uh-huh. And now J, and all of his science books and shit, she's gonna think he's a genius, too.<eos> How you doing up there?<eos> What, are you using your teeth?<eos> I don't hear any tools.<eos> - What's going on with you?
Can't do it.<eos> We got to go.<eos> Where the hell have you been?<eos> He needs at least six more hours on the I.V.<eos> Well, I don't know what to tell you.<eos> We'll take it with us.<eos> I talked to Marco.<eos> I told him we'd meet him on the beach.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not doing this with you.
Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna have the rent for a while.<eos> Come on, man, Smurf's gonna lose her shit.<eos> How about I ask her for the money?<eos> I'll tell her you sucked my dick like a champ, then sucker-punched me like a pussy.<eos> You owe me 4 grand.<eos> Minus the rent, let's make it 2,500.<eos> Hop in.<eos> Sorry, sweetheart.<eos> Family stuff.<eos> He'll catch up with you later.
Now, Nicky.<eos> What do you think Smurf knows?<eos> I don't know, man. I wouldn't let it get to your head, though.<eos> She says she knows.<eos> Yeah, well, what's there to know?<eos> Nothing.<eos> This one's yours, man.<eos> I didn't put a hole in it.<eos> It was a one-time thing.<eos> So, what is going on with you?
No, I should have hit her with the car!<eos> Okay.<eos> Do it for me, then, please.<eos> Just do it for me.<eos> Screw... you.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Stand up for me.<eos> - Cath, fix it.<eos> Fix it!<eos> What is going on with you?
Don't even think about it.<eos> I need you here.<eos> And Cath and Lena.<eos> Well, I got to check if Cath has plans.<eos> Cath does have plans... dinner at 6:30.<eos> I can go get Deran and bring him back home.<eos> Thanks, baby.<eos> But come at him gently, okay?<eos> You know your brother.<eos> Yeah, I'll go with you.
- Why you even here?<eos> - Do you wanna do it alone?<eos> - Do you?<eos> - Relax, man.<eos> No.<eos> One night in jail and you're in a shitty mood.<eos> Something happens tonight...<eos> I'm coming out firing. Do you understand me?<eos> They're gonna have to kill me 'cause I'm not going back inside.<eos> Jesus, man, what happened to you in there?
I promise.<eos> Morning, sweetheart.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> He doesn't look okay.<eos> It's called having skin in the game, man.<eos> Come on, we're just going paint balling.<eos> You sure you don't want to come?<eos> Come on, let me make you some breakfast.<eos> What's up?<eos> Hey, uh... can I speak to you for a second?
My phone ran out of battery.<eos> I just got a chance to charge it up.<eos> Coming home?<eos> Um, I was wondering if I could stay here tonight.<eos> You know, we're... we're just hanging out, playing video games.<eos> Might catch a movie later.<eos> Is that...<eos> Is that cool?<eos> Sounds great. Yeah.<eos> Enjoy yourself, and I'll see you in the morning.
Hey, hey, hey! Don't move.<eos> You want to see if my gun dry fires too?<eos> Man, I ain't kill nobody.<eos> Really?<eos> Then how come we found you sneaking around a murder victim's house?<eos> Attacking a Federal agent.<eos> I told you, I didn't know you was a Fed.<eos> I thought you was after me.<eos> Why?<eos> Who else is after you?
Okay.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> Oh, come on, Steven, who are you kidding?<eos> You knew I'd run DNA on the ashes I found in Boyd's coffin.<eos> You knew what I'd find, didn't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then what are you still doing here?<eos> Why didn't you run?<eos> Where would I go?<eos> God, Steven... what happened to you?
I'm working for the attorney general's office now, and I've been assigned your brother Danny's case.<eos> What case?<eos> Thomas Wilder.<eos> No, that case is done.<eos> The shooting was deemed justified.<eos> New evidence has turned up.<eos> What new evidence?<eos> The Wilder family submitted some audio tapes.<eos> Of what?<eos> I'm sorry, but I can't really talk about the particulars with you.
So you met Watson after you were shot by rivals in 2006?<eos> She pulled five bullets out of you?<eos> That's right.<eos> I've been shot five times.<eos> Although on separate occasions.<eos> That's... great.<eos> What kind of name is Shinwell?<eos> What kind of name is Sherlock?<eos> Shinwell.<eos> Hey. I, uh, wanted to talk to you about Nate Resor.
Murphy Station?<eos> Why?<eos> Black Dog Station.<eos> New mission. Wow.<eos> Russell has got to stop with the code names.<eos> What's the objective?<eos> Intel has located some surviving members of Hizb al-Shahid in Libya and Algeria.<eos> Seems that's where they decamped after the drone attacks.<eos> They want us to finish the job.<eos> Well, look, Jose, as much as I enjoyed almost dying with you...
You were right, Jefferson.<eos> I'm not a wartime consigliere.<eos> Are they gonna be okay?<eos> They'll live to fight another day.<eos> It's what we do.<eos> I used to fantasize about meeting you.<eos> Trading stories or having a beer.<eos> Or just making eye contact.<eos> I'm sorry, I, uh,<eos> I guess back at, uh, headquarters, I was afraid to get too close to you.
Gideon, can you pilot for a little bit?<eos> I need a break.<eos> Where are all the knives?<eos> Oh, there's one.<eos> Look, if this is about me taking all the mayonnaise, you might be slightly overreacting.<eos> You killed him!<eos> Killed him?<eos> I've killed lots of people.<eos> You're gonna have to be a bit more specific.<eos> What the hell happened to you?
But guess what?<eos> I got 'em, I lost 'em, now I really, really need 'em, and I can't get 'em back.<eos> This isn't all about you.<eos> I worked for years, spent billions of dollars to develop the Atom suit.<eos> I nearly die learning to shrink, and now, I have to teach you to destroy the very thing, the only thing, that makes me a hero.<eos> Wait?<eos> "Somatic overload" means destroy the suit?<eos> Yeah, Nate.<eos> We can't beat the Shogun while he's wearing the suit, so we have to blow the suit up.<eos> Your powers are within you.
Exactly.<eos> Where did you learn that?<eos> From a great sensei from where I'm from.<eos> Yoda.<eos> Ah, this Master Yoda is very wise.<eos> The Shogun approaches.<eos> Get to the temple.<eos> Where is my bride?<eos> She's not leaving.<eos> Not with you.
You think you are clever.<eos> You dishonor my family and torture my village.<eos> I will enjoy killing you.<eos> Your family will be extinguished from history.<eos> We haven't been introduced.<eos> Name's Steel.<eos> - Remember, you got to hit...<eos> - I remember!<eos> Do it!<eos> - Are you okay?
Do it!<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You did it.<eos> - I did it.<eos> Yeah... you blew up the ATOM suit.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You steeled on.<eos> Kind of proud of you.
Raymond, please hurry.<eos> I don't like the way this is going.<eos> You don't like the way this is going?<eos> How close are you to formulating a workable vaccine?<eos> Very.<eos> I think.<eos> Raymond.<eos> I'm counting on you.<eos> Don't worry, Mick.<eos> I got you.
We've only seen these things downwind from here.<eos> We can pick them off in this valley until they're all gone.<eos> I got my best men on the ridge to the West.<eos> But reports are, they are running out of ammunition.<eos> What?<eos> Helps me think.<eos> Well, without ammo, we can't take all these zombies out, even with perfect shots.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mr. Collins is gonna love spending the midnight hour with you, girlie.
I've been shot!<eos> The bullet has lodged itself between several of Dr. Haywood's internal organs.<eos> How's that possible?<eos> He's made of steel.<eos> Because it wasn't a normal bullet.<eos> It was dwarf star.<eos> I estimate his chance of survival at 51%.<eos> Ugh, would it kill you to say "better than average," Gideon?<eos> We had a plan.<eos> You went off book, now you're gonna cut the crap, and tell me what the hell is going on between you and Turnbull.
Somehow, the speedster's disguised himself as Stein, and he's turning over the whole ship.<eos> - I'll suit up. - I know how to get Sara away from fake Stein.<eos> What about that speedster gun?<eos> Yeah, I'm already on it.<eos> Martin, you've been acting pretty different ever since Darhk tortured you.<eos> Did they offer you a deal like they did me?<eos> Help us, and we won't hurt your daughter?<eos> My daughter?<eos> Sara, uh, Jackson and I were just on the bridge, and...<eos> He wanted to talk to you about ship stuff.
We should go now.<eos> Okay.<eos> My speedster weapon.<eos> Impressive.<eos> Unfortunately for you, the effects are only temporary.<eos> What did you do with Stein?<eos> Oh, I wouldn't waste my energy worrying about him right now.<eos> Whatever you're gonna do, do it now.<eos> In a rush to die, are we?<eos> I wasn't talking to you.
What could you possibly have to say?<eos> I'll just see you at the station, all right?<eos> Nice job with, uh, Thief.<eos> - Uh, give me a lift to CCU?<eos> - Sure.<eos> So you're still taking engineering classes.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, cool.<eos> All right, well, good... good luck with that.<eos> - What is wrong with you?
I don't wanna know anymore.<eos> Okay, I know this is a lot of pressure, but everything's gonna be all right.<eos> - I screwed up everyone's life.<eos> - Yeah, well, maybe<eos> - you should tell them. - I'm not gonna tell them.<eos> I mean, how is that gonna help?<eos> That's just gonna make everything worse. I mean... I don't know<eos> - how to fix this. - Okay, well, you're gonna figure it out.<eos> If there's one thing<eos> I've learned from you, is that with you, anything is possible.
It's too much?<eos> Yeah, it's too much.<eos> It's the heart, right?<eos> It's too cheesy?<eos> Hold on.<eos> Is that better? That's... that's worse?<eos> We'll go back to the heart.<eos> No, Bare.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> It is so beautiful, and you are so sweet, but tonight, I want to be with you.
- You're a liar!<eos> - Julian!<eos> - You're a meta-human.<eos> - Stop, no, stop!<eos> You put your foster father in the hospital, didn't you?<eos> - No, no!<eos> - Didn't you?<eos> Didn't you?<eos> Oh, I wanted to do more than hurt him.<eos> Now I'm gonna do the same to you.
Hey, so, where-- where did you go yesterday?<eos> Wha--I... I didn't want to interrupt your training.<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah, well, looks like there won't be much of that anymore, now that my dad is getting everyone to talk me out of using my powers.<eos> Wait, that--that's not why you're here, right?<eos> No, no.<eos> This is all me.<eos> You all right?<eos> You know, when this whole thing happened to me, you were... you were actually the first person I wanted to call.<eos> Yeah, I was sort of hoping it happened to you too.
It's okay.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> So no one else got hurt?<eos> Luckily, no.<eos> You don't have to worry about that.<eos> What about John?<eos> The DA's prosecuting him for what he did to you.
I've just been feeling nervous about this new dynamic between the three of us.<eos> I... I don't know.<eos> I have everything that I have ever wanted right now.<eos> And I've never had that in my life.<eos> In a lot of ways, it's scarier than having nothing, because... it's easier to fail than succeed.<eos> And I really want to succeed.<eos> What could you possibly be laughing about right now?<eos> I am so sorry, Barry.<eos> You are really sweet.<eos> But it is weird talking to you through a mirror and a speaker, and I really want to kiss you right now.
You've been reassigned to meta-human crime scene investigation full-time.<eos> Full-time?<eos> We're pouring all the resources we can into figuring out this husk problem, especially considering the last one turned out to be that evil speedster, The Rival.<eos> Any questions, concerns, you guys direct them to Judge Hankerson, yeah?<eos> All right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Joe.<eos> - Cecile.<eos> - Hi. I didn't know you were gonna be over here.<eos> Any excuse I have to run into you, I take it.
You know, I'm really looking forward to tomorrow night.<eos> So am I.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah. Okay, good, then I, uh,<eos> - I'll see you then.<eos> Yo. Is that what I think it was?<eos> You asked her to movie night with us?<eos> That's awesome. When did you do that?<eos> How'd you do it?<eos> As much as I'd like to gossip with you like a teenager right now, there's something else we need to talk about.
- Yeah.<eos> I might be mad if you weren't so gorgeous.<eos> Gorgeous, really?<eos> If I'm so gorgeous, then how come you're spending more time looking at that than you are at me?<eos> You know what?<eos> You're right, Cecile, I'm sorry.<eos> My son, Wally, he's... going through some changes and I'm just...<eos> - Hey. - Just really concerned.<eos> Joe, we can do this another time.<eos> No-no-no-no, I really want to be here with you, I do.
I have powers.<eos> What?<eos> What kind of powers?<eos> The cold kind.<eos> Happy now?<eos> So, what, we're just gonna keep secrets from each other?<eos> Yeah, well, this wasn't your secret to tell, was it, Cisco?<eos> I did that because I care about you.<eos> If you cared about me, then you would have let me tell them all when I was ready.<eos> Because this is happening to me, not you.
First off, we don't know what that's gonna do to Wally, right?<eos> Maybe this is the kind of situation best left to the people with the science.<eos> You mean Caitlin?<eos> Please help me.<eos> What are you doing down here?<eos> We should all be working to find Alchemy and Savitar and figure out how to stop them.<eos> Instead, we're fighting each other.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Team Flash is not at its finest.<eos> Why didn't I just follow you inside the house?
This is what they do.<eos> They kill their friends, because nothing matters to them anymore, right?<eos> Right?<eos> Come on.<eos> Kill me, Caitlin.<eos> You can't do it.<eos> You can't, because underneath all that cold, you're still you.<eos> Barry!<eos> It's okay.<eos> I got you.
That is what it feels like.<eos> Got the Speed Force coursing through you... giving you power.<eos> You're a speedster now.<eos> Cool.<eos> Um, so, what next?<eos> Um, Caitlin is gonna run every test she can think of on you.<eos> I mean, if you're up for it.<eos> Being a doctor?<eos> That, I'm always up for.<eos> Yeah, um, but when do I get to go out, Barry, with you?
You'll be fine.<eos> I promise.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> I just wanted to see if you wanted to talk about...<eos> I don't.<eos> All right. Um...<eos> Look, Cisco... you're my best friend, man.<eos> Are we gonna be okay?<eos> You and me?<eos> You want me to be honest with you?
Okay.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> I just met these people...<eos> These people need to understand this isn't gonna be easy.<eos> Don't hold back.<eos> Especially against me.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Does he not like me?<eos> He's like that with everyone.<eos> He'll warm up to you.
No, it's to work together, because that's the only way that you win.<eos> That is what I have been trying to teach all of you. Well, maybe there's a reason why you couldn't.<eos> We don't trust you.<eos> That's on you.<eos> No, man.<eos> That's on you. Because you don't trust us, because you don't want us.<eos> Ok, this is a setback, but we can salvage this.<eos> They'll listen to you. Can you just tell them how Oliver usually approaches things and--<eos> I tried that.<eos> I told them all about how you and Speedy and Spartan were a family, and even though you were tough and scary and even a little abusive, they clearly trusted you because they stood by you.
Look, Ollie, he told me you said that you needed a reason to stay sober, so...<eos> I thought maybe this could be it.<eos> Yeah, maybe it could.<eos> You let Church almost kill you so that you could recruit Ragman?<eos> I was betting that his heroism would trump his vengeance.<eos> That's a big risk to take on a stranger, don't you think?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I'm not done yet.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Are you all right?
Wow.<eos> The ever-expanding club house.<eos> And who are you?<eos> I'm Thea, Oliver's Chief of Staff.<eos> And also his sister.<eos> Don't tell me Oliver beat you up, too? Heh.<eos> Ollie did this?<eos> Object lesson, long story.<eos> It's fine. Don't ask.<eos> What happened to you?
Church is gonna take them out.<eos> Montes, quit screwing around.<eos> Station chief, this is Gans from cell block "C."<eos> We have a code yellow situation.<eos> Initiate immediate lockdown and have all prisoners return to their cells.<eos> I'm not rolling on Church.<eos> You think you scare me more than him?<eos> Hmm.<eos> No...<eos> But he's not here with you. I am.
Please.<eos> Let's get that done.<eos> I know this is one of the last things you want to be dealing with right now, but the rezoning vote is in a few days.<eos> Allowing us to expand low-income housing in Orchid Bay.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Ok. Well, we need a 4/5 majority vote from city council in order to pass the ordinance, and-- who are the holdouts?<eos> Only one that really matters--<eos> Councilman Kullens.<eos> Ehh, he is decidedly antiresidential.<eos> I was gonna say he's the most stubborn man in the city compared to you, but that works.
You guys all right?<eos> You look like you've seen a ghost.<eos> Heh. You survived.<eos> I guess I'll just have to kill you again, Oliver.<eos> You mind if I call you Oliver?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Unh! Get up!<eos> You're done, Church!<eos> You got much worse coming--heh-- and you don't even know it.<eos> He calls himself Prometheus, and he's gonna end you.
- My personal cell.<eos> Why would I need that?<eos> I think you can figure it out.<eos> What are you doing in Russia?<eos> I'm here to kill Konstantin Kovar.<eos> Tell me if you can get me close to him.<eos> All right, but only way will kill you.<eos> I have no family, I have no home. I have no name.<eos> You got much worse coming.<eos> He calls himself Prometheus, and he's gonna end you.
We don't.<eos> In order to cover that much ground, we have to split up and each take one potential target.<eos> We run surveillance.<eos> Whoever spots Prometheus first, call it in, and we all converge.<eos> Cool.<eos> Is everything ok?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> For a long time, I blamed you for my parents dying, that you were responsible for leaving them to suffocate in one of Damien Darhk's testing chambers.<eos> I know.<eos> It took a lot for me to come work with you.
Does your story have a point?<eos> Yes.<eos> That without unity one cannot accomplish anything in life.<eos> As I got older, I realized it also meant something else, that scum never amount to anything without help, that the Solntsevskaya Bratva can pull at the turnip all they want, but they will never, ever, ever<eos> Yes, that and...<eos> Don't become a damn farmer.<eos> Hello...<eos> Oliver Queen.<eos> My name is Konstatin Kovar.<eos> I've been looking forward to meeting you.
So...<eos> So what?<eos> You--you think you're him, you're-- you're that guy?<eos> I mean...<eos> I don't know what to think anymore, Thea, but, no, I don't think even my drinking could turn me into a psychopath.<eos> So why did you even resign then?<eos> Because I lied to you about going to the meetings, the drinking, and now, this--this psycho, whoever he is, he's--he's messing with me.<eos> He's targeting me.<eos> I'm damaged goods, Thea.<eos> I shouldn't be anywhere near close to you or the mayor of our city.
You know, I used to get shot at for a living.<eos> I don't know what it is about this building that's got me so scared.<eos> We're afraid of things we don't know, especially when we've been...<eos> living in pain this long.<eos> It's hard to even accept the idea of being happy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> When'd you become so wise, huh?<eos> I've been through...a lot--heh-- the last 4 years.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Your mother would be proud of you.
Go back to your family, your fiancée, and your fancy house!<eos> And you're gonna forget about all of this!<eos> Felicity's right.<eos> You've got everything, everything, man!<eos> Stop trying to throw it all away.<eos> You should have taken him up on his offer to carry you.<eos> It was awesome.<eos> Nobody's carrying me anywhere.<eos> It's so cool Felicity reached out.<eos> It's awesome to meet you.
Today... today, I want to marry you.<eos> Well, that's good because there are guests here.<eos> No, not with guests, not in a few hours.<eos> Now.<eos> Laurel, I need to...<eos> I need to get out of here.<eos> - I... we can elope.<eos> - Oliver.<eos> I'm being serious. I don't know what's going on with me right now.<eos> I just know that I want to be with you as quickly as humanly possible.
Well, that's good because there are guests here.<eos> No, not with guests, not in a few hours.<eos> Now.<eos> Laurel, I need to...<eos> I need to get out of here.<eos> - I... we can elope.<eos> - Oliver.<eos> I'm being serious. I don't know what's going on with me right now.<eos> I just know that I want to be with you as quickly as humanly possible.<eos> What is going on with you?
Ok, John. What now?<eos> Guys, I don't think that belongs there.<eos> Ok. That's either the way out of here, or we got to click our heels together 3 times and say,<eos> "There's no place like home."<eos> And if that doesn't work?<eos> It has to work.<eos> He's running out of time.<eos> Come on.<eos> Moira, voice-over: You're never without me, my beautiful boy.<eos> There's nothing else to say except I could not be more proud of you.
Because 4 years ago, the Hood took down<eos> Justin Claybourne, the CEO of the pharmaceutical company that manufactures it.<eos> By took him down, you mean killed, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> After Claybourne's death, his company went down.<eos> He had no other family members to leave it to.<eos> Still, Prometheus using Dycloseral 4 years after the fact can't be a coincidence.<eos> It does send the message.<eos> What message?<eos> "I'm alive, and I'm coming after you."
- I didn't look here.<eos> - At least we know she's alive.<eos> We just got to figure out where Tamar took her.<eos> [man] Excuse me, ma'am.<eos> - Looks like you could use a little air.<eos> - Back up, asshole.<eos> Whoa, take it easy, sweetheart.<eos> I said back up.<eos> God damn it!<eos> What the hell's wrong with you? !
- Teeing them up,<eos> - Party of Zingers.<eos> - and I'll just keep knocking them out...<eos> You know what this is?<eos> It's a temper tantrum...<eos> You know, they say you can judge a person by how fast they return a phone call.<eos> Really?<eos> That's how this works?<eos> You take advantage of me...<eos> - How did I take advantage of you?
Okay.<eos> We really don't need to be doing this.<eos> No, I want to.<eos> Look, watch.<eos> See?<eos> Doesn't that feel good?<eos> Mmm, baby, how's that?<eos> Laurel talked to you, didn't she?<eos> - What?<eos> - My sister talked to you.
That finish was a little bitter.<eos> Well, you're learning.<eos> And no.<eos> It's new.<eos> Here.<eos> "Marcienne." Never heard of it.<eos> Ah, it's a small Bordeaux estate in Pomerol.<eos> Only produces one wine.<eos> Long day?<eos> I really need to talk to you.
We need to go with MSST and board the Heritage Star.<eos> Agent Russo already cleared it.<eos> We got room on the small boats for two.<eos> I'm gonna coordinate from the cutter.<eos> Russo already cleared it?<eos> It means he wants us on the Heritage Star.<eos> You think it's a trap?<eos> Either way, we got to do it.<eos> We got a crew of ten on that tug.<eos> All right, I'm with you, King.
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.<eos> What... what's going on?<eos> - I...<eos> - This has mold in it.<eos> Okay, stop.<eos> - Burn.<eos> - Stop, stop, stop.<eos> - What's happening?<eos> - Johnny walked out.<eos> We couldn't reach you, and we tried calling that guy Chad, but he doesn't pick up his phone.
Howard, didn't you tell me it was a dress-up party?<eos> I was told this is where to go if I'm mad at Howard.<eos> May I take your cloak?<eos> Thanks.<eos> This thing kept getting caught in the chain of my bike.<eos> Well, I'll catch you up.<eos> Uh, Penny is angry at Leonard, Leonard's angry at me and Penny,<eos> I'm angry at Leonard and Amy,<eos> Raj is angry at Howard, and I'm angry at George R.R. Martin 'cause there are no new books for me to spoil for Leonard.<eos> So what happened with you and Howard?
Sorry?<eos> Well, I just took your side 'cause sometimes I get annoyed at how close Sheldon and Penny are.<eos> Well, they argue all the time.<eos> They aren't that close.<eos> Who's always comforting him when he's upset?<eos> Penny, but...<eos> Who's the only one who can make him take his medicine when he's sick?<eos> I try to hide it in his peanut butter, but he spits it out.<eos> Okay.<eos> And did you know she has him add things to the Roommate Agreement so she can get her way and not fight with you about it?
Travis didn't come to the meeting because I got in his face and chased him off.<eos> Oh, Christy.<eos> I'm sorry, I just couldn't help it.<eos> Well, you know what you got to do now.<eos> No. I am not apologizing to that kid.<eos> He can rot in hell for all I care.<eos> Really?<eos> Is that the kind of person you want to be?<eos> Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.<eos> I'm proud of you.
Remember he bought you that metal detector for your birthday, and you thought you found an alien time capsule.<eos> Okay, to be fair, I was only eight years old, and I'd never seen a beer keg before.<eos> Dad loved that spot.<eos> Yeah, a couple times, he wrote me a doctor's note and we went there on a school day.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> Neither did Mom.<eos> I miss him a lot.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> He'd be so proud of you.<eos> Oh, look, Jerry, there's something really important I need to talk to you about.
I thought you said he had an airtight alibi.<eos> All right, let's go, Iron Man.<eos> Mazie should have a peaceful journey.<eos> I really appreciate this, Max.<eos> And everyone else's help.<eos> Yeah, anytime.<eos> It's time.<eos> Feels pretty good to help an animal in need, doesn't it?<eos> Better sanitize that truck fully before you turn it back to me, bruddah.<eos> I'm proud of you.
Why?<eos> Am I, am I speaking to myself?<eos> Why can't you say that?<eos> Because you're wrong.<eos> Adam's not running.<eos> He's leaving a trail for us to find him.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> I thought you were the cops.<eos> Sorry.<eos> They sent me to find you.
Doesn't matter.<eos> People who I work for will never...<eos> Hey, Garavito!<eos> Drop the knife!<eos> Put down the knife!<eos> Yeah, I need an immediate medical evacuation.<eos> Sending location now.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Shut up.<eos> How many more are with you?
Yeah?<eos> Yeah, it was during the ill-fated test run of Kamekona's Catamaran Tour.<eos> When Flippa set the sails ablaze with a flare, we found ourselves adrift at sea.<eos> That's when I realized that I was gonna die without having fulfilled my lifelong dream of joining Médicins Sans Frontières.<eos> Which in the stateside is known as Doctors Without Borders.<eos> Yeah, I've, uh, I've heard of them, Max.<eos> Thankfully they are eager to accept volunteers who have medical training.<eos> So, now, I get to fulfill my lifelong dream and make a difference to the ambulatory.<eos> I mean, we're gonna miss you, but... this will be an incredible experience.<eos> I'm proud of you, man.
Hold your position.<eos> Make sure no one gets out of the building.<eos> What about the girl?<eos> Get rid of her.<eos> Still no word from Abby.<eos> We gotta go back.<eos> I wouldn't worry too much about her, Chin.<eos> I'm sure she's fine.<eos> Hey, what'd I tell you about talking?<eos> I'll go back with you, Chin.
- I don't like getting emotional...<eos> - T-there's...<eos> - and I don't think it's fair.<eos> No, there's-there's something coming out of your ear.<eos> That's just... uh...<eos> I got my ear pierced and it got infected.<eos> No, no, it's coming from inside your ear.<eos> That's just blood. Ouch.<eos> I need antibiotics.<eos> Did any bugs get near you?
Look, if we leave it like this, if you leave, then it will mean something, so, stay, and it won't mean anything.<eos> I can't figure out the algebraic psychology of that, so... good night.<eos> Okay.<eos> I showed it to the chief resident.<eos> He still thinks it's an artifact, not a mandible.<eos> Well, they're not gonna believe it until we give 'em a real one.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Nothing.<eos> This line may not be secure.<eos> I'll get in touch with you later.
That why you asked me in here?<eos> I wanted to check in one more time.<eos> Given what we know about who Dr. Naylor was, and what she did, and given the way Tetch was hired, you still think this is all going to lead back to your father?<eos> We both heard Tetch confirm that Emil Kurtz was the target.<eos> That gives my father motive.<eos> We might not see all the strings yet, but he is a puppet master of the highest order.<eos> One more time before what?<eos> You said you wanted to check in one more time bef...<eos> Before I pay him a visit.<eos> You want me to join you?
That's pretty careless of you.<eos> David will be along any second now.<eos> Happy to see you, Miguel.<eos> Or whatever the hell your name is.<eos> One day you're at my home, the next day you're missing.<eos> We were all concerned.<eos> Oh, yeah, those guys you sent over to kill me-- they-they seemed really worried.<eos> Don't know what you mean.<eos> Cut the crap, Leo.<eos> I'm not here to play any more games with you.
I'll walk him to his graduation.<eos> Yeah.<eos> [loud clattering, whirring]<eos> Alderman Casey.<eos> Call me Matt.<eos> He's not listening to me.<eos> Hey.<eos> You going?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll go with you.
Alderman Casey.<eos> Call me Matt.<eos> He's not listening to me.<eos> Hey.<eos> You going?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll go with you.<eos> - I don't need a babysitter.<eos> - Yeah, I know you don't.<eos> But I'm walking with you.
Chase.<eos> Jason and Alison Kemp.<eos> That's the solo account.<eos> I need the joint one.<eos> Come on, man, open that back up.<eos> Goddamn.<eos> - March.<eos> - All right, man, Jesus.<eos> All right, now the Delta page. The other Delta page.<eos> - Seriously, man, are you okay?
Hawk...<eos> And an IS girl.<eos> He says he doesn't want to leave school.<eos> It's exactly what had happened with Tessa.<eos> You remember?<eos> She was almost 16, ready to take her vows.<eos> What if he leaves us?<eos> I mean, what if he... he chooses to be Ignorant?<eos> The Garden without Hawk...<eos> Let me pray with you...
Somewhere new.<eos> - D.C., maybe.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> - It does.<eos> It should.<eos> Was it because we...<eos> because of the other day?<eos> Did I make you feel like you had to do something you didn't want to?<eos> It has nothing to do with you or us or the other day.
You mean your follower, your disciple, your brainwashed weirdo?<eos> My colleague is anything but brainwashed, and, in fact, no, she went against my orders because... because she actually... she actually gives a shit, all right?<eos> And she believes that someone as fucked up as your son is capable of real change and transformation.<eos> My colleague... is a fucking angel, and you are lucky your son crossed paths with her.<eos> Get the fuck out of my house!<eos> I predict that when they come back in a few days, they'll be better off than when they left... both of them.<eos> ♪ Love me, love me, love me ♪<eos> ♪ Love me, say you do ♪<eos> ♪ Let me fly ♪<eos> ♪ Away with you ♪
- What girl?<eos> - An IS girl.<eos> You need to deal with this, Sarah.<eos> You don't know what it's like to lose a child.<eos> Go up to your room, and we'll handle this later.<eos> Is that where you were, with an IS?<eos> Hawk says he doesn't want to leave school.<eos> It's exactly what had happened with Tessa.<eos> She was almost 16.<eos> - Let me pray with you.
I know he wouldn't have done bad things to people, so whatever it is that he was doing, I know it was good.<eos> Did you ever go to Peru with him?<eos> A few times.<eos> And you saw him doing these things like feeding the poor?<eos> Yeah, taking care of sick people.<eos> I did.<eos> That's good.<eos> That's great.<eos> That helps because, you know, I have tried... am trying. Doing everything to be back in, to believe that what we are doing is right, but I don't know.<eos> Ever since Peru, since the medicine, since meeting you, I'm just... I'm just messed up.
I need you to help me manage the situation with Hawk and Ashley.<eos> Sarah, shouldn't we let him find his own way?<eos> No.<eos> - No.<eos> - Sarah.<eos> You're leaving already?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I have a good idea.<eos> What's that?<eos> I could come with you.
- Cal.<eos> - No. Why was he coming in your bedroom in the middle of the night?<eos> Did you two have a thing or...<eos> Not really.<eos> - Not really? - It's not a thing.<eos> - Then what?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Seemed like something.<eos> Enough of something to send me to Delaware.<eos> He told me to be with you.
We leave them at every stop, lightening our physical substance...<eos> Really, it's just for exercise.<eos> Government has issued what's called a stay of removal, essentially calling Uncle after a standoff at the Meyerist compound.<eos> The fringe religious movement was successful at getting declared a protected space, meaning the removal of the Honduran immigrants, along with their children, has been indefinitely delayed.<eos> She is.<eos> Ready?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> You... this is... this is not necessary.<eos> We are so proud of you.
You can get my kids to shut the fuck up.<eos> Russel doesn't seem too capable.<eos> - Honey...<eos> - It's okay.<eos> Anger can be a good engine sometimes, all right?<eos> We need to channel whatever energy we have right now.<eos> We can call you when the baby comes.<eos> No, I want to stay.<eos> I want to... want to be of help.<eos> Ohhh... Remember, the pain is not bigger than you. It is you.
Well, at least not in The Movement.<eos> Closest thing to it was probably when I met your mom.<eos> You know, she can just lift all my doubts and pain just by looking at me.<eos> Hey, hey, don't.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> I love her.<eos> I know you just think it's a Transgress, but I love Ashley.<eos> She makes me feel like that... like it might all be okay.<eos> And when she's not here, I just feel so empty and awful, and...<eos> I mean, how can one person do all of that for you?
Yeah, that's it.<eos> Do you understand my intention?<eos> Yes.<eos> Are you present for my questions?<eos> I am.<eos> Was there anything between you and Cal?<eos> No.<eos> I think I was confused... When I first got here.<eos> But that was then.<eos> Now I'm here with you... all of me.
Why don't you take a week in rehab, Betsy?<eos> It'll do you good.<eos> I'll talk to Richard.<eos> I know how hard this must be for you.<eos> I know you came to us full of heartbreak.<eos> But perhaps this is what The Light is giving in return.<eos> Steve believes that committing to another human being's wounds, past, present, and future, is a great challenge but also the most rewarding experience one can have in this life.<eos> That's why marriage is a cornerstone of The Movement.<eos> If you forgive me, I want that... that challenge.<eos> With you.
Hawk.<eos> He's leaving us.<eos> That's unacceptable.<eos> Help me.<eos> Help me.<eos> Please, help me.<eos> Hey, Ashley.<eos> I'm a friend of Hawk's family.<eos> Yeah, I remember you from, like, the church or whatever you call it.<eos> Can I talk to you about something?
You saw Doc dying.<eos> What about The Ladder?<eos> Do you see The Ladder?<eos> No.<eos> Do you think that I... am going crazy?<eos> I mean, is this a psychotic break?<eos> I think you're having visions, Eddie.<eos> You have to find out what they mean.<eos> How am I supposed to find out what they mean?<eos> The Light is trying to communicate with you.
You can check her out.<eos> Happy holidays.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Can I come in?<eos> Well, I'm just... I'm just working on something.<eos> It's kind of private.<eos> I just, um... I came to say yes.<eos> Yes?<eos> I want to stand beside you on Friday.

I burned those copies of our surveillance tapes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thanks, Rollins.<eos> Every floor for the last 48 hours.<eos> Thanks, Rollins.<eos> Really appreciate it.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> - Castle?<eos> - Geez!<eos> What's with you?
So, what's going on?<eos> W-Why are we on lockdown?<eos> You didn't tell them?<eos> Considering the danger, I didn't think it was my place.<eos> Dad, does this have something to do with what you found out in L.A.?<eos> Of course.<eos> I apologize.<eos> Uh, y-you both have a right to know.<eos> This all started when...<eos> So, Caleb was burned alive because LokSat found out that he switched sides and was working with you?
(TENSE MUSIC)<eos> # #<eos> I'm telling you, that test is wrong.<eos> There's no way I have a baby.<eos> That test says you're lying.<eos> That test is your fingerprint.<eos> I was in Chicago to go to the clinic.<eos> I come here every month for treatment there.<eos> That's why my phone...<eos> We start calling the girls' names in your contacts... they're gonna say they weren't with you?
I'm not here for Niflheim.<eos> No.<eos> You are here for me.<eos> You?<eos> I do not understand.<eos> Come tomorrow, you will.<eos> Niflheim contingent has left the hotel.<eos> Less than three hours until the ceremony.<eos> Bolster the Citadel guard.<eos> Nyx, is the princess with you?
You gotta be kidding me.<eos> They teach piloting back at the royal academy?<eos> Give me that.<eos> It's been a long time since I fought at your side, old friend.<eos> Yes.<eos> But this time it is not your fight.<eos> If you wish to leave, go now.<eos> And abandon my king?<eos> I think not.<eos> Besides, our magic is bound to you.
I'm gonna need another favour.<eos> Meet Lunafreya Nox Fleuret, our prince's beloved bride-to-be.<eos> And she has the future of the world in her hands.<eos> Keep her safe, get her out of Insomnia.<eos> Oh, I almost forgot.<eos> You'll need this.<eos> Give Prince Noctis my regards.<eos> Libertus will take care of you from here.<eos> Have a safe journey, Your Highness.<eos> What will come of you?
EMTs woke her up.<eos> She's just saying random words.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - You guys okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Fine.<eos> They're gonna take her to Med.<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> I wanna be there when she wakes up.<eos> I'll ride with you.
Imagine trying to get that past your old man.<eos> Imagine talking to my old man.<eos> Hey, Francis Kruger.<eos> If this is about that family, let me spare you,<eos> - I didn't do it.<eos> - What about the robbery?<eos> What robbery?<eos> Come on, Francis.<eos> You know this.<eos> You tell us what happened, everything goes good for you.
What, she break up with you?<eos> Dad find out what you were doing?<eos> 'Cause...<eos> Look at me.<eos> Any version of this is motive.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I would never hurt Katie.<eos> Okay, what about her mom, Jeni?<eos> We know she was suing you.
I've been wanting her to meet you guys, too, so this seems like the perfect opportunity.<eos> Oh, but I won't be there.<eos> Funny how that worked out.<eos> Does this mean Emily's not in the picture anymore?<eos> No, I'm still dating her.<eos> Okay, help me out.<eos> How are you doing this?<eos> Do they know about each other?<eos> They know that we're not exclusive, and we just don't ask too many questions.<eos> You know, it's like how I play Warlords of Ka'a with you and Elder Sign with Frank and Alicia.
Like what?<eos> Uh, mostly Penny's heard them.<eos> Boy, you get some dirty looks over there when you ask for ice.<eos> Zack, this is my friend Claire.<eos> You're hot.<eos> You seeing anybody?<eos> Uh, she's seeing me.<eos> Why'd you say she's your friend?<eos> We're just keeping it casual.<eos> Why is he being casual with you?
And any time you need a break from being Bernadette the Pregnant,<eos> Bernatrix the Warrior Queen is here waiting.<eos> I might just take you up on that.<eos> Well, mind you now, that offer's only good until the third trimester.<eos> I can't risk getting amniotic fluid on my spot.<eos> Hey, dude, you're killing me with Claire.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I mean, come on, look at you.<eos> You're classically handsome, you've got a swimmer's body.<eos> Next to you, I look like me.
Wow.<eos> Didn't even make it out of the parking lot.<eos> Uh, you know what, enough about Leonard.<eos> Let's talk about you.<eos> What would you like to do while you're here?<eos> Dear, I'm a psychiatrist.<eos> You don't have to avoid having intimate conversations with me.<eos> Well, I'd actually like for us to be close, but maybe we start with our favorite books and work our way up to my husband's sex organs.<eos> Very well.<eos> What's the last book you read?
Only buses carrying non-Japanese passengers are to be used.<eos> Completely unacceptable.<eos> General Onoda was most insistent, Trade Minister.<eos> It can wait.<eos> What of the research I asked you to carry out?<eos> Lolita.<eos> Nelson Mandela.<eos> Cuban Missile Crisis.<eos> I could find no reference to any of these in official records, Trade Minister.<eos> - What happened to you?
I'd given up on everyone and everything, and youput me back on my feet.<eos> You brought me back to life one step at a time.<eos> Frank.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I want you to know that my feelings for you were and always will be more real than anything I've ever known.<eos> Whatever happens,<eos> I don't believe our fate is inevitable.<eos> And you shouldn't, either.<eos> I don't know if we can change it, but I believe wehave to try.<eos> You'll always be with me, Frank, and I hope I'll always be with you.
Where you been?<eos> Where you been?<eos> - Heaven.<eos> - Tell me where you been.<eos> What, are you fucking wearing lipstick?<eos> When'd you start wearing lipstick?<eos> Where you been?<eos> Tell me where you been and don't lie.<eos> Don't tell me you been at Tina's, 'cause your mother already colluded on that lie and I'm not buying it.<eos> - I don't have to lie to you, I don't have to tell you anything.
What?<eos> - What did you do to my pictures?<eos> - I didn't do anything.<eos> - I found all these fucking pictures in the trash.<eos> Those are mine and you scratched out the faces!<eos> - Why do you think I did it!<eos> - Because you're a fucking retard!<eos> You have mental problems, or you're queer or something, I don't know. - Just shut up!<eos> Shut up!<eos> - What is wrong with you, Pete?
Is there a reason you're here, Doctor?<eos> Well, waiting for a child to come out of surgery, that's a stressful time for... for any family, and we like to make ourselves available for questions, concerns.<eos> I thought you just said the surgery was going well.<eos> It is. So why would we need to talk to anyone?<eos> Aaron, please.<eos> Look, can't you see what this is?<eos> This phony concern for your hand?<eos> Is Daddy in trouble again, Mommy?<eos> - No... no, honey. - Doctor, let's step outside.<eos> - Can I come with you?
Push 50 of fentanyl.<eos> No!<eos> What's that?<eos> No, what's that?<eos> - It's gonna help you.<eos> - No!<eos> - Ellie?<eos> - Wait, no!<eos> Ellie, we have to do this.<eos> It'll help us figure out what's going on with you.
Of course not.<eos> You're too brave for that.<eos> Hey, Eric, you mind if I have a really quick word with your dad?<eos> Take a seat for a second right over there, hun.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I shouldn't have made this about you when it wasn't.<eos> It's my brother.<eos> I really did not like what he was doing at that party.<eos> I get you.<eos> I really like being with you.

Was he exposed to any toxins in the house?<eos> No, we're careful about that.<eos> Anything else you can think of?<eos> Only... he... he just started sitting up, but he hasn't been able to do that the last couple days.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's order a CBC, CMP, UA, and blood cultures, and let's start a 10cc bolus of albumin and page Dr. Grant.<eos> What is all that?<eos> We just need to run some further tests, and I'm bringing in a specialist to consult.<eos> Okay?<eos> We're gonna find out what's going on with you.
What?<eos> I've got TB?<eos> Yeah, I'm afraid so.<eos> Dr. Rhodes, we're so very sorry for your loss.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Um, Ms. Goodwin, I'm gonna need a few personal days,<eos> - if that's all right.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Thanks. - Yeah.<eos> Thinking about you, pal.

Why doesn't she know about the new business manager, Dad?<eos> What are you two talking about?<eos> Dana, honey, I'm not cheating on you.<eos> Who said you were?<eos> Mom.<eos> Okay, there is something that I've been keeping from you.<eos> Both of you.<eos> Are you okay, Dad?<eos> Noah, please, don't go.<eos> Look, I don't know what's going on with you and your ex, but, dude, leave me out of it.
You've committed academic fraud!<eos> The consequence of which is no Juilliard, no college, period!<eos> - What?<eos> Do they know?<eos> - (screaming) I know!<eos> And you have put me in a terrible position, Brandon, because if I report this, which I am ethically and professionally required to do,<eos> - Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> - Sorry's not gonna cut it, Brandon!<eos> First, everything with Callie and now this...<eos> - what is going on with you?
So you were... you were 14 back then, right?<eos> Look, Patrick Molloy, he's a bad guy and he preys on kids.<eos> I'm trying to put him away, okay, but I'm gonna need your help.<eos> I... I can't help you.<eos> Why not?<eos> Did someone try to... get you to change your mind, get you to change your story, or...<eos> like a cop or a detective?<eos> I know you're scared, you know?<eos> I get it.<eos> But I really don't think that you want this guy doing to other kids what he did to you.
Good.<eos> Stef: Are you in the city?<eos> Yeah, I just came out of the subway.<eos> I'm at, uh, Columbus Circle.<eos> Mike: Did you get lost yet?<eos> No one gets lost anymore, Dad.<eos> I've got my phone.<eos> Headed to Lincoln Center.<eos> I'll call you when I'm checked in and at the dorm.<eos> Mike: Okay, we're proud of you, B.
Um, yeah.<eos> Why?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Um, just don't take any pictures with anyone in a costume, unless you're willing to pay them.<eos> Some of them can get really aggressive.<eos> You know, I might just end up walking around here...<eos> No.<eos> You have to go to Times Square at least once.<eos> Um, I'm going to a party in Midtown.<eos> I can walk with you if you want the company.
I thought he looked too young to be in law school.<eos> I told him my name was Cameron.<eos> He took me for a ride on his motorcycle. And we went to the beach.<eos> And he kissed me.<eos> When was this?<eos> When I was suspended from school.<eos> I also told him I had a boyfriend.<eos> So he does want to date you?<eos> No, we're just friends.<eos> I'm not toying with you. Or yanking anyone's chain.
Look, Mike, I know you don't like Callie.<eos> Okay? But I do, and I'm gonna keep seeing her.<eos> And if you don't want me to keep seeing her, well, that's too bad.<eos> I'm gonna be 18 soon, and if you don't want me staying under your roof anymore, I guess... I'll just move on.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Did... did your sister tell you that I was home?<eos> You want to come in?<eos> Look, Mariana doesn't want to say this to you because she doesn't want to, you know, hurt your feelings<eos> I guess, but... she doesn't want to be with you anymore.
You have to let me go.<eos> You have to.<eos> If you're gonna leave, then leave.<eos> I'm not gonna watch you.<eos> Know this, luv.<eos> I will never stop fighting.<eos> I will brave the oceans and sail past the sirens to find my way back to you.<eos> Now why haven't I seen her before?<eos> I took Bonnie home.<eos> I would have gone with you.
Your nose is bleeding.<eos> What's your poison?<eos> What are you drinking there?<eos> Can I buy you one sometime, ever?<eos> - I don't feel very good, all of a sudden...<eos> - Tilt your head back.<eos> Watch it.<eos> (whispering): I don't know if I can do this.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I got to be honest with you, I've never been to a art exhibit before, but this is nice.
- Josh.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> For your brother.<eos> Bid.<eos> Six.<eos> - Do I hear seven?<eos> - Six...<eos> Damn, you gonna let him do you like that?<eos> - We've got seven.<eos> - What is wrong with you?
No.<eos> We haven't found them yet.<eos> Keep looking.<eos> Last time she checked in, they were splitting from Chandler's family.<eos> I'm sure Mom found a good place for them to lie low with the baby.<eos> Kara, you should take Wilson.<eos> Let me handle Shaw.<eos> You can't let it be personal.<eos> Look, this is a mission.<eos> If you let your judgment get clouded by anger or...
Tex!<eos> Tex.<eos> You're a good man.<eos> You're an American, Colonel.<eos> Stand down.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Take me away. It won't matter.<eos> Somebody else will take my place, somebody who sees the world for what it is and seizes the opportunity.<eos> The people are too wounded and scared to think for themselves.<eos> Today they follow you, but tomorrow, they will find another golden calf to worship.
You're just as human as the rest of us.<eos> I have to hold myself to a higher standard.<eos> Shaw was right about one thing.<eos> This country has lost its moral compass.<eos> It needs someone to guide it.<eos> Get it back to its core values.<eos> I can't be that person.<eos> Tom...<eos> Danny?<eos> There's somebody here who wants to meet you.
Uh, Sofia, I may be seeing my aunt I haven't seen in 10 years.<eos> Do you think beer's gonna help me?<eos> I need tequila!<eos> And look, check it out. I found these old photos of her.<eos> Oh, you can really see the tattoo I picked out for her in that one.<eos> Aw, it's a slice of pie with the words "Cutie Pie"<eos> - around it. - Mm-hmm.<eos> All right, I'm off to apply for jobs, just to see if I can get 'em.<eos> Hey, uh, Gabi, good luck finding your aunt.<eos> I'm proud of you.
We're you looking for this?<eos> Good point.<eos> I sat in the back.<eos> Had I come as the new me, we would have had another funeral the next day for your grandfather.<eos> Believe me, I wish I had spent more time with your mom before she passed away.<eos> I regret it every day.<eos> You look so much like her.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> You don't.<eos> You know how many times that I've looked you up on Facebook?
Randall just totally cook-blocked me.<eos> We've got to get rid of him.<eos> Trust me, I know these number-crunching types.<eos> It's only a matter of time before he convinces Josh, he doesn't need a full-time publicist.<eos> - Or a housekeeper.<eos> - Or a personal chef.<eos> Who the hell needs a personal chef five days a week?<eos> Oh, my God, what are we gonna do?<eos> I got it.<eos> If Josh sees sparks between you and Randall, he'll get rid of him.
Whatever. I still hate Randall.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I don't mean to make you feel uncomfortable.<eos> I'm glad you're all here and appear to be on break.<eos> Guys, I just wanted to say, I'm sorry.<eos> I think I came on a little strong and I'd like to make it up to you.<eos> Drinks on me tonight?<eos> I'm sorry, I cannot socialize with you according to LegalZoom.
So until we do, we're going to have an agent posted outside your home.<eos> Does my dad know what happened?<eos> BISHOP:<eos> We tried to make contact, but base communications are still down.<eos> Can you find out when he's coming back?<eos> We're going to do our best.<eos> (horns honking, brakes squeaking)<eos> FORNELL:<eos> So, where is this contact of DiNozzo's?<eos> What's with you?
Do you know that?<eos> Yeah, I know that.<eos> I mean, I... I'd love to say yes to this place or... or some other place.<eos> I'd love to say, "Hell, yes, let's do it."<eos> For you, Dad.<eos> I'd love to say that for you.<eos> It's not for me, son.<eos> But I'm not responsible for you anymore either.<eos> I don't want you to be.<eos> And I think the main reason I went to work with you, or for you, was so I could still, in some way, try and look after you.
Hi.<eos> Hey, there.<eos> You've created such beauty here.<eos> I mean, it was just a box, wasn't it?<eos> A big box.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> The theory is you, uh, go over and over it until you become bored with it.<eos> Not there yet?<eos> No.<eos> I'm proud of you.
No problem.<eos> I'm glad you're moving on, Mom.<eos> If that's what's happening here.<eos> Just kinda need a warning of which Janet I'm gonna get... the one who's moving on or the one who's still knee-deep in her shit.<eos> Because it seems I never get to be a part of the good times.<eos> In fact, I usually get the Janet that wants me to get knee-deep in the shit with her.<eos> Hey, you shouldn't talk to her like that.<eos> It's okay, Jared.<eos> No, it's not okay.<eos> No, I'm glad that you're enjoying your mother being present for you, Jared.
This is your lucky day.<eos> You get to leave me a voice-mail.<eos> Hello, Chloe.<eos> It's Daniel... in case you're confused about that.<eos> Anyway, I, uh, thought I might come back after work and... and see you, uh, and, uh, maybe help you, uh, finish packing.<eos> Or maybe help you start unpacking.<eos> That was sort of a joke.<eos> Hey, Dan.<eos> Oh, yes, Julian?<eos> Can I speak with you?
It's out of my hands, Trey.<eos> All you son of a bitches playing God!<eos> You can all go to hell!<eos> Mmm. I mean, I wouldn't call this nouveau cuisine, but that sure hit the spot.<eos> That it did. Mmm.<eos> Especially with you springing for it, Daniel.<eos> Appreciate it.<eos> Here's to Mr. Pickle.<eos> May this be just the beginning of the good life for you, my friend.<eos> Here, here. We're proud of you, old man.
Hello, Ted.<eos> I just wanted you to know that I've got the Ceramic Mechanic, and, well... It was your dad's, and I think it should be yours.<eos> That's just how I feel.<eos> That's thoughtful, Ted, but, uh, I was never really that attached to it, to be honest.<eos> And I know it means a lot to you.<eos> It did, but things change.<eos> Want to just leave it here at the house for now?<eos> I'd... I'd like that, Ted.<eos> And, uh...<eos> I'm really sorry for what's happened to you, Daniel.
You know, she loves her dance class, and why would we take her out of school in the middle of the year?<eos> No, no, no. No, no, no.<eos> We wouldn't move her until after school's over for the year.<eos> Well, yeah, no. "We" wouldn't move her anywhere.<eos> Uh, "we" is you and Penny.<eos> Mm.<eos> You can't do this.<eos> You don't get to just decide to...<eos> I haven't decided anything.<eos> I'm trying to talk to you.
Wait.<eos> That's your date?<eos> That's the guy you were gonna do the...<eos> - Please don't.<eos> - I mean, I wouldn't.<eos> I'm classy, remember?<eos> Hi.<eos> What are you...<eos> - Hey. - Uh, I'm working.<eos> I'll... I'll... I'll walk with you.
- Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> I called the sitter.<eos> The kids are okay.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> What happened?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just wanted to make sure they're okay, and they are.<eos> What's wrong with you?
I told you Mer was gonna side with you.<eos> I think we have a real shot at this.<eos> I feel better than I did this morning.<eos> How are you?<eos> I spent the day with Dr. Robbins.<eos> - I was on her service.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> How was it?<eos> Was it terrible?<eos> Was she terrible to you?
Come on in!<eos> Hi!<eos> Here we go!<eos> I don't want to.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's been a really rough morning.<eos> She woke up really early and then she didn't have breakfast, so...<eos> That's okay.<eos> We will make waffles, or...<eos> I'm going with you.
I'll tell her to expect your call.<eos> Okay.<eos> - I think Grandma over there just arranged my marriage to her daughter.<eos> Well, there must be something in the air, because Amelia and Owen are talking about getting married, too.<eos> Hey, maybe you guys could have a double wedding.<eos> Then I would only have to live through it once.<eos> Help!<eos> Please!<eos> Someone help!<eos> It's okay, buddy. I got you.
He has made it very clear he doesn't want me anywhere near him.<eos> So, no.<eos> Does she have him on fluconazole in case it's fungal?<eos> You do realize that Kyle can see you?<eos> It's not one-way glass.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Kyle?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - Are you okay? - I'm fine.
I thought I knew what I was doing, but... he still died.<eos> I thought I knew what I was doing.<eos> You and I... we're good, right?<eos> I mean, this is real between us.<eos> We know what we're doing.<eos> I think we do.<eos> Why aren't we doing it? Why aren't we building our life?<eos> I don't want to waste our time on conversations or some hypothetical lives someday.<eos> I...<eos> I want a real life... and I want it with you.
Not if I have anything to say about it.<eos> You know, you weren't there when Ella's forensic report pointed us at Roberta.<eos> So how'd you put this together?<eos> Well, I was on the Devil's business, Detective.<eos> Look, even if I told you, you'd just say I was being crazy.<eos> Hmm.<eos> That's funny.<eos> That's what your brother was just saying about you.<eos> Oh.<eos> Amenadiel talked to you, did he?
Is for a specific market.<eos> And when I get to the general, all them mouth-breathing morons who couldn't read a newspaper column if their lives depended on it, well, they'll think I only just started telling people what they wanted to hear,<eos> and they got the real me six months ago.<eos> To tell you the truth, my most pressing concern is there ain't enough Purell in the world to make me want to keep shaking their filthy, inbred hands.<eos> I mean... ugh! ... Country people.<eos> Am I right?<eos> So, we got a deal?<eos> We got a deal.<eos> Now see this?<eos> You, I got no problem with.
But the thing is, I'm not ashamed at all.<eos> The only person who would have really been hurt is him.<eos> It would have hurt him.<eos> And not just publicly.<eos> Abby.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> No one knows.<eos> How did you find out?<eos> Your father told me.<eos> And, Liv, I don't think he's done with you.
Then what are you saying?<eos> 'Cause it sounds like you're accusing me of something.<eos> Are you accusing me of something?<eos> - No, I just...<eos> - Spit it out, woman!<eos> If you have a problem with the way I'm raising my children...<eos> I just wish you wouldn't go in there.<eos> She's my daughter, Lanie!<eos> Am I not supposed to say goodnight to my daughter?<eos> Don't walk away from me when I'm talking to you.
Tell me what's going on.<eos> I swear, the games you and your father play.<eos> Tell me what is going on.<eos> Your father is putting me on Edison's ticket in hopes of making me Vice President of the United States.<eos> Marrying Vanessa is all part of the plan.<eos> Increase my name recognition, raise my profile.<eos> She's the perfect political wife.<eos> Perfect for somebody.<eos> You can say no to him, Jake.<eos> He only has power over you if you allow him to.
No.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> I'm not in love with Vanessa.<eos> You know that.<eos> You've... felt that.<eos> The truth of the matter is that I'll never love anyone as much as I love you.<eos> You have never chosen me.<eos> We've done horrible things to one another.<eos> But for some reason, I still end up here.<eos> In front of you.
Look at me.<eos> He is not here.<eos> I am.<eos> I am your family.<eos> I will... take care of you.<eos> Let him go.<eos> That's right.<eos> That's right.<eos> I don't want to marry Vanessa.<eos> I want to be with you.
Choice is yours.<eos> Jake.<eos> Liv.<eos> You here to wish me luck?<eos> Before I go ahead and jilt a perfectly lovely woman in possibly the most public and humiliating way ever conceived?<eos> - I could really use...<eos> - I can't do this.<eos> What?<eos> You can't do what?<eos> Be with you.
Jake.<eos> Liv.<eos> You here to wish me luck?<eos> Before I go ahead and jilt a perfectly lovely woman in possibly the most public and humiliating way ever conceived?<eos> - I could really use...<eos> - I can't do this.<eos> What?<eos> You can't do what?<eos> Be with you.<eos> I can't be with you.
Well, we can fix this.<eos> Jake, no.<eos> This can't be fixed.<eos> - What happened?<eos> ! - What always happens.<eos> I think I want something, I think I want to be with you, be normal, and...<eos> You love me.<eos> Jake, listen...<eos> You love me.<eos> I can't be with you!
It's okay.<eos> No.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> I'm not scared.<eos> I may be horrible because I'm abandoning you, because I always abandon you.<eos> But I'm not scared.<eos> Not the least bit.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> And pathetic.<eos> I could tell you five minutes from now that I want to be with you, that I want to save you.
And pathetic.<eos> I could tell you five minutes from now that I want to be with you, that I want to save you.<eos> You would crawl back to me.<eos> Forgive me. Every single time.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Do you honestly not know by now?<eos> I'm in love with Fitz.<eos> I don't love you, Jake.<eos> I love him.<eos> When I'm with you, all I think about is him.
Do you honestly not know by now?<eos> I'm in love with Fitz.<eos> I don't love you, Jake.<eos> I love him.<eos> When I'm with you, all I think about is him.<eos> Fitz is who I choose.<eos> He's who I will always choose.<eos> You are just a lesser version of him.<eos> A sad reminder of the man I truly deserve.<eos> If I couldn't make it work with him, why the hell would you think I could make it work with you?
Right?<eos> You're doing great.<eos> I saw you on Kimmel.<eos> I heard about Cardinal Suarez.<eos> That couldn't have been easy.<eos> You're up in the polls.<eos> Really giving us a run for our money these days, aren't you?<eos> It makes you wonder why I ever even wanted your endorsement in the first place.<eos> Congrats, Mellie.<eos> I'm proud of you.
Fitz...<eos> Not like that.<eos> Like this...<eos> Talking to you, listening to you.<eos> Do you think I listened to you enough?<eos> When?<eos> When you were talking?<eos> Fitz, what's going on?<eos> Mellie says the entire way I've handled this speech has been controlling, manipulative, and narcissistic.<eos> I don't want to get in between you and Mellie.

No one will be the wiser.<eos> Michael will be punished, and you will have your daughter back.<eos> Pressure...<eos> Some wilt, some rise.<eos> For others, like myself, it's a drug.<eos> We enjoy it, need it to perform.<eos> The magnitude of tonight's event cannot be undersold.<eos> The pressure on these candidates and who they choose to stand beside them is crushing.<eos> The coronation is soon to come.<eos> I could not be more proud of you.
I'm sitting here practicing my speech, and all I can think is "Why?"<eos> Why run for Vice President when frankly, I'd rather flip patties at Gettysburger.<eos> You'd be the second most powerful person on the planet.<eos> And completely miserable.<eos> I-If I still feared your father, yeah.<eos> Your name is on the poster.<eos> We announced you.<eos> Check out this house that's for sale.<eos> I drive by it every day on my way to the office.<eos> It is the most normal, unremarkable house I've ever seen in my life, and I desperately want to live in it with you.
I just need to talk to her.<eos> - Could you tell her I stopped by?<eos> - Sure.<eos> She's going through a hard time right now.<eos> - Just be patient with her.<eos> - I will.<eos> That's good to know.<eos> I'm sorry, Emma.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> Telling him about the phone without talking to you... it was wrong.
- (ALL SCREAMING) - Emma, thank God.<eos> - The killer is here!<eos> - I was wrong about everything.<eos> It was a trap.<eos> I know.<eos> We have to get the hell out of here.<eos> - You guys, what's going on?<eos> - Kieran, what are you doing here?<eos> - I was worried.<eos> I followed you.
The only thing you're getting this summer is your hand and some lotion.<eos> [Scoffs] 50 bucks says I hook up with Cricket before you get with Amy.<eos> Hey. What's your name?<eos> [Russian accent] Anton Melnikov.<eos> - May the best man win.<eos> - Anton Melni-what?<eos> How do you even pronounce that?<eos> [Laughter] Anton Melnikov.<eos> Commie.<eos> What the hell's wrong with you?
I don't believe any of it.<eos> All that crap written on the walls... that's not you.<eos> I knew you then.<eos> That's sweet.<eos> Uh, I...<eos> I better get the kids to bed.<eos> Who taught you how to play like that?<eos> My grandfather.<eos> But my dad, he made me stick with it.<eos> He must be proud of you.
So, no one's seen anyone wander onto the camp?<eos> There's a drug dealer in town.<eos> The Crowley kid, Damon, he's been busted selling drugs in these woods before.<eos> He's a real creep.<eos> - And he's tall.<eos> - Find him.<eos> Get him out of my camp.<eos> Let us get back to normal.<eos> Damon Crowley. Are you sure?<eos> You want me to come with you?
An A is an A, whether it's at Napa Valley Tech or Harvard.<eos> Yeah, but if you're getting brain surgery, which diploma do you want to see on your doctor's wall?<eos> My A's are A's.<eos> Don't crap on my A's.<eos> Nobody's crapping.<eos> I'm just trying to inject a little reality here.<eos> Wendy, you're in Mensa, tell her.<eos> Um... we mostly do puzzles.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Christy, you're a totally different person than the hot mess that crawled into that meeting three years ago, and I'm so proud of you.
Don't you dare ruin this special day with my daughter.<eos> Oh, I think this special day will be ruined when your credit card gets declined.<eos> That's it, get out.<eos> "Get out"?<eos> You heard me, turn into a bat and fly away!<eos> Make me.<eos> I didn't think so.<eos> (bellowing)<eos> Get off of me!<eos> What is wrong with you? !
I did, too.<eos> But talking with her really helped me after Iran.<eos> I know, and I'm grateful for it, but this is an entirely different situation.<eos> Is it?<eos> Because you are up half the night walking the floors.<eos> You-you say the same moment with Dmitri plays over and over in your head.<eos> - That sounds a lot like<eos> - Okay, what happened<eos> - what I went through.<eos> - in Iran happened to you.
Sorry. Kev put that one in with the colors.<eos> It's okay.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - No problem.<eos> That's what friends do for each other.<eos> Jesus, any colder in here, we're gonna need parkas.<eos> What's with you and V?<eos> Really couldn't go to the Laundromat just like everyone else?<eos> Well, just 'cause you want to ice everyone out doesn't mean I have to.<eos> - What's up with you?
That's the story you just told me.<eos> No, Joe.<eos> Listen...<eos> Just dig deeper on this.<eos> Indulge me.<eos> That's all for today.<eos> Get some sleep, Ryan.<eos> You're starting to miss things.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - I need to talk to you.
One.<eos> I can't believe you.<eos> Right back at you.<eos> We agreed to discuss this when I got back.<eos> We agreed to discuss this on Monday. It's Friday.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Who cares?<eos> I'm here now.<eos> Since when do you make decisions for my company without consulting me?<eos> God damn it, I tried to consult you and I couldn't find you.
I don't even know what to think anymore.<eos> I try to decipher your sayings, but then the phone rings and you boot me to another zip code.<eos> And we still haven't figured out how to make any money and I go home every day and I'm spinning and I don't even know if you like me.<eos> I feel crazy.<eos> You're not going crazy, Ryan.<eos> You're hungry.<eos> Look, I've had a tough week.<eos> Will you join me for dinner?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, I'll come to dinner with you.
You made it on the train.<eos> Yeah!<eos> I think it's a good time to consider an IPO.<eos> I'm not chopping my company up so that you can ring a bell on Wall Street.<eos> Cam.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I got married.<eos> To Tom back in Texas.<eos> Why don't you come back to the house.<eos> - You're done. - Ken.
The market likes Mutiny, but in a year or two, or however long it takes to implement the changes you have in mind, who knows?<eos> We can't count on tomorrow's landscape looking like today's.<eos> Mutiny isn't sustainable as it exists now.<eos> Our whole user base is tied to the Commodore 64.<eos> We need to diversify to other platforms in order to grow.<eos> And isn't that what Wall Street likes?<eos> Growth?<eos> The kind of investment that I'm talking about in time and money will pay off and smart investors will see that.<eos> Your ideas are good, Cameron, and some of them are even great.<eos> And I want to explore them with you, all of them. - Mm-hmm.
Is there any line you don't expect us to cross?<eos> Yes. This one.<eos> I don't expect you to dirty your hands planting the illicit oil.<eos> I simply need you to arrest Kirk's employees once they possess it.<eos> And how is any of that gonna happen?<eos> Have a little faith, Harold.<eos> Lord, guide us on this long and treacherous journey.<eos> For judgment is coming.<eos> Judgment walks among us.<eos> And Lord knows when it comes for you, there will be nowhere left to run but the waiting arms of the Lord.
I agree, green it is.<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I dig the bowtie.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> I spit up on myself.<eos> What do you think happened?<eos> Will you watch the cart?<eos> We're gonna go wash up.<eos> I'm coming with you.
We did it.<eos> We're free.<eos> How?<eos> The "how" won't change anything.<eos> I suppose I knew what I would do that afternoon in the car on the drive to the mobile ICU.<eos> That poor girl.<eos> So afraid.<eos> Always looking over her shoulder, in the dark about who she was and why it mattered.<eos> But it wasn't just about Elizabeth anymore.<eos> Her child was already paying the price for her association with you.
Come on, Spence.<eos> You can't let your pride derail you of making the right decision again.<eos> I can't get you anything you want.<eos> I can get it myself.<eos> I don't need you to get it for me.<eos> How you gonna hunt down $15 million?<eos> None of your goddamn business where I'm gonna get it from.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> Tell me you're not gonna get it from your clients.<eos> Spence, that is the reason why me and you are in this mess.
(sobbing)<eos> Now you may have a fry.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> So what did the bastard do?<eos> We don't know that he's a bastard.<eos> He's seeing someone else.<eos> That bastard.<eos> What tipped you off?<eos> Does he come home, take a shower, then go straight to bed, too tired for sex 'cause he had a rough day at work?<eos> Mom, this isn't about what men have done to you.
You really don't have a second gear, do you?<eos> Well, what did Gregory tell you?<eos> My son, who has never lied to me, told me that Violet has been drinking a lot and doing the pot and the ecstasy.<eos> Okay, first of all, there's no "the" in front of pot and ecstasy.<eos> You would know.<eos> And I think I would know if Violet had a problem.<eos> You sure about that?<eos> You know what, Phyllis?<eos> I've got a daughter at home crying her eyes out.<eos> I am not gonna stand here and argue with you.
I get it.<eos> We're having pork ribs for breakfast because I miss Adam.<eos> Ribs? (retching)<eos> That's okay.<eos> More for me.<eos> I always thought if I got her through her teen years, it would get easy.<eos> (chuckles) You know when it gets easy being a mother?<eos> When you're dead.<eos> And even then, you might worry a little.<eos> I owe you an apology.
If you do this again, I'll go to your school report to them.<eos> Promise me.<eos> Dont do it again, alright?<eos> Tomorrow we need to pack up.<eos> After school, come back straight home.<eos> Mal Soon too.<eos> Don't play at school.<eos> I dont want to move anymore.<eos> If we move... we can go eat some tangsuyuk together. [Tangsuyuk - Sweet sour pork]<eos> Aigoo, what happen to you?
- Great!<eos> You want to go sit at his table?<eos> So, Misty... have you heard about this new group, the One Wayers?<eos> Grassroots.<eos> Shrink the government.<eos> No new taxes.<eos> We've received 83 calls in the last week.<eos> This isn't some ploy?<eos> Get us to report on something you guys are just astroturfing?<eos> Would I do that to you?
Yes. - All right, let's go.<eos> - Senate's in session.<eos> - Now, Senator?<eos> - There's no one here.<eos> - We are.<eos> Yeah, that's right, play the race card, 'cause that's what you people do.<eos> "You people"?<eos> "You people."<eos> Do you see how these phrases flow so naturally from Senator Wheatus's lips?<eos> Honey, you don't have to worry about my lips, 'cause they're never getting near you, I can promise you.
Jess?<eos> For Pete's sake. What is that infernal racket?<eos> Hey, I was just making some table legs.<eos> But if it's too loud,<eos> I can table them for later.<eos> This whole summer, you've been doing one activity after another.<eos> The urban corn harvest.<eos> Learning Portuguese.<eos> You joined that SoulShred gym and got scary ripped.<eos> What is going on with you?
Your new hood!<eos> Okay, so, I couldn't check all the boxes, but I think nailed the most important one: That it can float.<eos> That's a... that's a boat.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I was just driving to my doctor's office last night and I saw it.<eos> And you thought, "Okay."<eos> Where-where's your doctor's office?<eos> Three boats down.<eos> Should we call Aly and tell her the good news?<eos> I had no idea you were going through this.
- We did it!<eos> I'm so happy for you guys.<eos> Hey, I gotta go.<eos> I got it.<eos> Beautiful family.<eos> It's okay, it's okay.<eos> This is stupid.<eos> I can't keep hiding from him.<eos> - Jess, just give me a sec, okay? - No, Cece... Cece, it's fine.<eos> I'll come back with you.
For a father to show his son what he's achieved?<eos> Let me introduce you to some very good friends of mine, very dear to me.<eos> _ _ _<eos> Thomas.<eos> What do you say, uh, you and me just take the car and go out to the lake like we used to?<eos> I can't.<eos> There's a Hitler Youth meeting this afternoon.<eos> So you'll miss it.<eos> Miss it?<eos> Are you okay, Father?
Are you serious?<eos> We're in a fight.<eos> Exactly.<eos> When two people are in a fight and one person is so clearly wrong, like you are, the person who is so clearly wrong apologizes.<eos> - I'm sorry. - Profusely.<eos> Really, really sorry.<eos> I am.<eos> Honestly.<eos> Why did you lie to me about your sister?<eos> With the whole Mother's Day thing, I was feeling... a little inadequate compared to you.
So, if you didn't know he was at the casino, where'd you think he was?<eos> I didn't think about it, really.<eos> Well, Vincent usually picks up Olivia after school and then takes her to her math tutor or piano practice.<eos> After that, sometimes they pick up dinner or groceries, then they head home.<eos> What time do they usually come home?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why not?<eos> I'm not always awake when they get home.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Walt, can I talk to you?
- Oh, yeah.<eos> Good, 'cause I liked him.<eos> I know.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I have something to ask of you.<eos> What?<eos> I didn't ask anything of you.<eos> You're on some committee giving funding to the CDC.<eos> And they're saying that these fatal strokes are because of some bad blood pressure medicine, but we think they're wrong.<eos> "We," meaning those two people in the conference room with you?
How do we figure out how it communicates?<eos> Go to the clusters.<eos> Here, the Mall, and here, near the Capitol.<eos> I'm sorry, Laurel.<eos> For...?<eos> Last night.<eos> What happened.<eos> I-I should've told you.<eos> I have a drinking problem.<eos> That's why I didn't want to drink last night with you.
Yeah, what, was your bacon brother busy?<eos> Come on, T.<eos> You're my original bacon brother.<eos> I'm talking OBB.<eos> And you want to hazard a guess as to who's down with OBB?<eos> Every last Tandy.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Tandy, ever since Mike showed up, you don't have time for me anymore.<eos> Oh, don't you dare.<eos> Uh, every time I try to hang out with you, you're always either with Gail or Melissa.
You're real good at acting.<eos> I know.<eos> Well, if you don't like it, why don't we do something about it?<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Now I got to be honest with you.<eos> That's the best policy.<eos> I want you to leave.<eos> No, I'm staying.<eos> I want to be here for you.
Hey, Vanessa, I called...<eos> I'm late for a flight. I wrote, I tried everything.<eos> I miss you.<eos> What do you want me to say to that?<eos> Let's have dinner tonight.<eos> Let me explain. I'm flying to Bulgaria in three hours.<eos> For a job?<eos> But I thought you quit.<eos> I didn't quit working, JC.<eos> I just quit working with you.
Which means you need to find a way to change the schedule.<eos> You need to be wrapped by 6, 7 p.m. at the latest.<eos> ...and, you know, couldn't do it.<eos> Real hamsters is more practical.<eos> They did good, though.<eos> Excuse me. Ah, JC.<eos> Perfect.<eos> I want you to meet one of your co-stars, this is Victor.<eos> Big fan, Mr. Van Damme.<eos> Really excited to be working with you.
- Woodstein?<eos> - Oh, fuck.<eos> Just get into the studio chop chop.<eos> Didn't you get the memo?<eos> It's totally tabloid week here at Cal-Jazeera.<eos> Offer her, oh, five grand.<eos> Come!<eos> OK, you two, what the hell's going on?<eos> Darling, I have no idea what you're referring to.<eos> - Are you alright?
"Cleaver is the best associate I've ever had, "and has earned such a reward, as have you.<eos> "I'm already plotting where to send you both next Christmas,"<eos> in brackets, "unless you'd rather just go with me.<eos> "With oodles of love, Ed.<eos> "PS -- thanks for lugging back the vase.<eos> Mum loves it."<eos> Oh, and there are five kisses.<eos> Why wasn't this produced in court?<eos> Well, this way we get to do a deal.<eos> Obviously the originals are extremely secure and will only be used in the event that Cleaver is charged with anything in connection with you, Ed.
What can you tell us about them?<eos> About what?<eos> You know, the allegations about the cocaine.<eos> There's cocaine?<eos> The cocaine in the vase.<eos> You know, from Morocco.<eos> Cleaver has a vase of cocaine?<eos> Where?<eos> Cal, mate, we're stopping the tape.<eos> Meg needs to speak to you.
Birthday.<eos> - Did you remember?<eos> - Mmm, yes.<eos> - Well...<eos> - I remember birthdays.<eos> - This'll be your... - Ahh!<eos> Let's not say anything we can't take back.<eos> Since when do you want to celebrate your birthday?<eos> Well, I have a pretty, um, idiosyncratic definition of the word 'celebrate' and what that may or may not entail.<eos> Oh, God, I'm not going away with you for the weekend.
Yeah.<eos> Elliott saw you when he was going to get Yolanda's cake.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Okay, but I only...<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You knew?<eos> So, this whole thing was just a setup to humiliate me?<eos> No, no, no, no, no. You're not turning this around on me.<eos> Oh, it's turning all by itself.<eos> I may have lied, but it was only a desperate attempt to make myself not look pathetic in front of you.
Guess who scored the presidential suite?<eos> - Whoa.<eos> - ‭Yeah.<eos> Wait, how much did that cost?<eos> Like 1,700 bucks.<eos> - What?<eos> - ‭Yeah.<eos> That is, like, half of our budget for our honeymoon.<eos> - Why didn't you consult with me?<eos> - Consult you?
I shouldn't have said anything.<eos> - So, so sorry.<eos> - I was so mad.<eos> Why are you moving - your-your head like this? - What?<eos> ‭What?<eos> 'Cause you two are not fighting the night before my wedding.<eos> After my wedding, you two can kill each other, but before my wedding, everyone gets along.<eos> Got it?<eos> Oh. I'm so sorry.<eos> No, I should have consulted you.
She laughed!<eos> Oh!<eos> Her first laugh!<eos> ‭Baby has your sense of humor... laughing at others' tears!<eos> We're finally family.<eos> Jerry, wait.<eos> Have I introduced you to... well, my son?<eos> Michael, this is Jerry.<eos> Yeah, I know Jerry.<eos> From when I worked with you for a week.
Listen,<eos> - I'm really sorry... ‭<eos> - No. No need.<eos> Stop.<eos> I understand.<eos> And, look, if Esteban makes you happy for some... very strange, inexplicable reason...<eos> Stop.<eos> He doesn't.<eos> Thank God.<eos> I want to be with you.
I understand.<eos> And, look, if Esteban makes you happy for some... very strange, inexplicable reason...<eos> Stop.<eos> He doesn't.<eos> Thank God.<eos> I want to be with you.<eos> Honestly.<eos> And, also... I still don't want more kids.<eos> So, there you have it.<eos> I want to be with you, too.
Here you are.<eos> Press that hard against your nose.<eos> All right?<eos> Here you go.<eos> Stem the flow.<eos> Good lad.<eos> Well, that's a very nasty scar.<eos> Where'd you get that?<eos> Or can't you remember?<eos> What did they do to you in there?
- How the hell do I know?<eos> !<eos> Said she cut herself. "Clean yourself up then," I say.<eos> "You don't understand," she says.<eos> "My blood is on the counter." Next thing I know, the whole damn kitchen's in flames.<eos> Someone's got to pay for this damage.<eos> You tell me where she is, my client will pay.<eos> - Who's your client?<eos> - You know where she is?<eos> If I did, would I be talking to you?
I wanted to apologize for the way I treated you last night.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was insensitive and rude.<eos> Hmm. Does Alfred know you have his car?<eos> No.<eos> Why tell him?<eos> It's mine, not his.<eos> Would you like to go for a ride?<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> What's with you?
Then give me something to fight this until I find him.<eos> There's usually a trigger that brings on the hypnotic state.<eos> What's the last thing you remember?<eos> He pulled out his watch.<eos> Asked if I could hear it ticking.<eos> That's it, then.<eos> His watch.<eos> Anything resembling the ticking will trigger the impulse.<eos> He's made you a prisoner in your own skin.<eos> He did it to you.
Forget about him.<eos> He's even more screwed-up than you.<eos> You're more normal than you think.<eos> You're up.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Barnes told me what happened during the attack.<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> I heard the tape from the interrogation room with Alice.<eos> Listen to me...<eos> Whatever Jervis is doing to you...
Stop fighting and let go.<eos> The past is the past.<eos> There's nothing I can do to change that.<eos> There's a difference between moving on and letting go.<eos> No!<eos> Well, well, Mr. Gordon breaks my spell!<eos> I daresay it's time we bid this foul city our good-bye.<eos> - No!<eos> - Alice!<eos> I'll never go with you!
- Oswald Cobblepot<eos> - There's that. Has won the mayor's office.<eos> I believe in you, Oswald.<eos> You never believed I could win this election on my own.<eos> Maybe you're not cut out for this, after all.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> - Jervis.<eos> Let her go now.<eos> - No! I'll never go with you!
Need a hand, kitten?<eos> I got it.<eos> Hold on, Butch.<eos> Sir, the ambulance carrying Butch Gilzean was just hijacked.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Put out a BOLO. I'll call the mayor.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> M-M-Mister, please.<eos> My dear, sweet sister.<eos> Just look... at what he did to you.
- I hope you know, Oswald, you can always count on me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Miss Kringle.<eos> Dinner.<eos> Chez Moi.<eos> Okay.<eos> That's for Kristen.<eos> Whatever happened with Tetch?<eos> Broke his sister out of GCPD.<eos> I'll never go with you!
Hmm? Pain and sadness.<eos> Don't listen to him, Lee.<eos> Look in her eyes.<eos> She still has love for you, James.<eos> And then, there's Valerie Vale.<eos> The intrepid reporter from a blue-collar family.<eos> She still has hope for you.<eos> What will happen when she learns who you really are?<eos> So... those are the choices.<eos> Now it's up to you.
She was terrified of you.<eos> She hated you.<eos> - Enough.<eos> - She told me... what you did to her when you were kids.<eos> The thought of you disgusted her.<eos> Lies!<eos> Deceit! The story you tell is incomplete.<eos> She loved me.<eos> She loved you?<eos> She killed herself rather than be with you.
It's time for me to go.<eos> No.<eos> I want to talk to you more.<eos> No, I can't.<eos> Someone's coming for me.<eos> No, Dad.<eos> No, Dad, please.<eos> Don't go.<eos> No, Dad!<eos> I'm proud of you, Jimmy.
Oh, my god.<eos> - Just give us a minute.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Listen to me, and I know how this is gonna sound...<eos> You think that he has Alice Tetch's virus.<eos> - He told you.<eos> - Yes.<eos> And he told me that you had him arrested today, on our wedding day.<eos> And you had Lucius give him the test three times, and he passed.<eos> What's wrong with you?
What are you talking about?<eos> Penguin.<eos> - He killed the librarian.<eos> - What?<eos> And you cut off my hand?<eos> !<eos> I assume you want something.<eos> With penguin gone, the underworld will need a new leader.<eos> I think it's time Gotham had a woman's touch.<eos> The crime families will never follow you.
Hey.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you for letting us leave that party early.<eos> Hmm, of course.<eos> I wanted to.<eos> I love this house.<eos> It's my father's refuge.<eos> Not many people know about it.<eos> I know Gordon came to the church.<eos> Talked to you.
Wait a minute.<eos> We gonna have a little nog-off.<eos> Really?<eos> Grandma Esther versus Grandma Millie.<eos> You know I love a challenge, Joe West.<eos> May the best grandma win.<eos> I am so sorry for your grandma.<eos> We'll see.<eos> - Fine. - Yeah.<eos> - I'll pick you up, all right?
I'm seeing double.<eos> The Flash hit me too hard!<eos> I'm gonna sue you, saucer-head!<eos> One day, I'll own that helmet, and I'll use it as an ashtray or a candy dish.<eos> No, wait, a hubcap!<eos> I had that, kid.<eos> That's what I always say.<eos> Especially when I didn't have it.<eos> So I'm assuming you didn't come all the way to Earth-3 to stop my Trickster.<eos> I have something I need to talk to you about.
Who is he?<eos> Don't know, never seen him.<eos> You're the first speedster I know of who has.<eos> But every story I ever heard about Savitar is basically the same.<eos> Savitar was the first man ever granted speed.<eos> And over time, he became the god of motion, the fastest of us all.<eos> Before Savitar graces an Earth with his presence... He sends a predecessor to prepare for his arrival.<eos> Alchemy.<eos> What's he preparing for?<eos> A battle with you.
And over time, he became the god of motion, the fastest of us all.<eos> Before Savitar graces an Earth with his presence... He sends a predecessor to prepare for his arrival.<eos> Alchemy.<eos> What's he preparing for?<eos> A battle with you.<eos> Why me?<eos> You're threatening his power.<eos> How do you know all this?<eos> Speed Force myths, legends, rumors.<eos> If Savitar's come for you once, he'll be back.
I'm saying that at this point in his training, you're faster than Barry.<eos> You're faster than Barry, you're faster than Barry, you're faster than Barry!<eos> - We got to tell everyone.<eos> - Not a good idea.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Self-preservation, basically.<eos> Look, Wallace, you have tremendous potential.<eos> Yes, clearly, but one thing I've learned since coming to this Earth is you do not trifle with the West household.<eos> No, you know... no, say you're with me.<eos> - Yeah, I'm with you.
Not too bad for a guy that got beat up by a myth.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - You stopped him.<eos> Well done, Barry.<eos> It was nice, having you out there with me.<eos> Yeah, I never had a sidekick.<eos> - I'm your sidekick?<eos> - Well, as a senior partner.<eos> Senior citizen is more like it.<eos> I'll bet your dad would've been proud of you.
It's like the box doesn't even exist.<eos> Two weeks ago, I almost lost you to Alchemy, then last week aliens.<eos> My heart can't take it, Wally.<eos> Dad, he gets it.<eos> - Iris, does he?<eos> - I think so, yeah.<eos> And you...<eos> A couple weeks ago, you were telling me how you believed in me and my instincts, and now you're encouraging Wally to do exactly the opposite?<eos> I don't know how much encouraging he needed.<eos> What's the deal with you?
Okay, I need an anti-psychotic.<eos> Caitlin!<eos> If you leave, I'm gonna have to leave, too.<eos> So you're telling me that... that every time I'm blacking out...<eos> You've become Alchemy.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> Alchemy is a monster, he's been terrorizing people for years.<eos> Look, it's not you.<eos> Just like it wasn't you back on that dig.<eos> I know that this is hard to believe, but you have to start accepting what's happening to you.
I'm at the high school.<eos> Why would you tell me that?<eos> Because I'm gonna need a favor, little brother.<eos> And what would that be?<eos> Whatever desire you have to save me, I kind of need that right now.<eos> I'm starting to consider a destination wedding.<eos> Try finding a Mystic Falls venue that hasn't been the site of a horrible atrocity.<eos> Hi, Bonnie.<eos> I'm Sybil.<eos> So glad to finally meet you.
To make empty threats?<eos> Not empty, brother.<eos> Don't move or I'll snap his neck.<eos> Give Matt here a non-transferrable invitation to our supernatural breakfast club.<eos> Damon, enough.<eos> Sweet Caroline.<eos> How many innocent people did you kill on your no humanity bender, hmm?<eos> Doesn't matter what you say or don't.<eos> The devil knows what you did.<eos> What's happened to you?
I kept you safe for three years and then you tried to kill me. It looks like you might be trying that again?<eos> I'm gonna get through to you. I'm gonna use your darkest fears to pull you out of this.<eos> Okay, well, I'm a complicated person. In my 140 years on this Earth, - no one's figured me out.<eos> - Oh, well. Guess I'll die trying. Oh.<eos> You think I'm afraid of fire because Damon left me in a fire. Nice try.<eos> But no.<eos> You're afraid of people leaving.<eos> Period.<eos> You're afraid of being abandoned.<eos> The one thing that happens to you again and again.
Exactly, brother.<eos> - What's the point?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm not buying it.<eos> I can see your humanity trying to break through, Damon.<eos> Come home with me.<eos> I can help you be happy again.<eos> How?<eos> It'll take time and work.<eos> But I'll be there for you.
Your girls are very special, Ric.<eos> You've always known that.<eos> Special girls have special needs. The less you know, the better. Just know that<eos> You're right.<eos> The less I know, the better.<eos> But I'll tell you, I could give a damn about your plans, because they're never gonna happen.<eos> I'm gonna find you... and I'm gonna kill you.<eos> No discussions, no last-minute pleas for my sympathy.<eos> You have been in my home with me. And somehow, in all your scheming, you've missed just how far I'm willing to go to protect my children.<eos> I'm not coming for you.
That's a question for Alaric.<eos> He's on the phone with Matt.<eos> I'll go put this in the car.<eos> No.<eos> Stop.<eos> You're not coming.<eos> What?<eos> Ric and I can handle it from here. And if you really want to help, then just stay with Matt and work with the police. Caroline, you can't be serious.<eos> The twins have been abducted by two sirens, and you expect me to just hang back? Damon is with them.<eos> Right. Which is exactly why I should come with you.
I was dead.<eos> But even in death, Cade's psychic power reached into my soul and heard my screams for life.<eos> No one wants to die.<eos> In that moment, you'll agree to anything, even slavery in hell.<eos> Oh, well, that's good to know. Because I have a deal of my own in mind, and I'm gonna need your help to pull it off.<eos> Go on.<eos> I can multi-task.<eos> Where are the children?<eos> Tell me, and you can do whatever you want with me, I don't care.<eos> I'm already doing what I want with you.
I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No, I don't accept that.<eos> You... are going to be waiting at the end of that aisle for me and we are going to start our lives together that day.<eos> Our day is tomorrow.<eos> It's my last day.<eos> No.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> Because my one condition was that I get to spend my last 24 hours of freedom... with you.
Take them away from me.<eos> I'm done.<eos> No more killing in his name.<eos> Sorry, sissy.<eos> You're about to start making payments on your karmic debt.<eos> You cut me out of the agreement?<eos> This is for Tyler.<eos> I surrendered my immortal soul to Cade.<eos> I have to serve him the way the sirens did and deliver the darkest souls to hell so I don't end up there myself.<eos> My one condition was that I get to spend my last 24 hours of freedom... with you.
Peter fellow?<eos> I've heard so so much about you.<eos> Back off.<eos> Or what?<eos> - Bonnie?<eos> - Don't hang up.<eos> Bonnie and Enzo are here with me.<eos> They're in no danger.<eos> We're fine, Ric.<eos> Seline just wants to talk to you.
Nobody wants Keisha.<eos> Of course not!<eos> She's old and homophobic.<eos> If we wanted that, we'd take in my grandma.<eos> Sweetie, I understand you're in shock. We didn't<eos> - get the three-year-old we wanted.<eos> - I didn't even want the three-year-old!<eos> - What? - (Elliot sighs)<eos> I was going along with it for you.<eos> I wanna spend my life with you!

Pass.<eos> See?<eos> She's impossible.<eos> Honesty.<eos> You're impossible!<eos> Guys, she's not impossible, she's a teenager.<eos> If you want her to have fun, just do something she likes.<eos> Take her to mall and go shopping.<eos> Now that's what I'm talking about.<eos> Can I kick it with you?
Hi!<eos> Wow, guy who has my mom's old number, you're real and you're cute.<eos> Hey, I'm Sofia.<eos> I really liked your article on the breakup of Journey.<eos> "Do Stop Believing," thank you.<eos> - Gabi, we gotta get going.<eos> - Oh, right, you gotta get there early so you can take notes and really capture the moment?<eos> No, I ate a special brownie and it is about to kick in.<eos> You two have fun at the concert.<eos> I'm so glad good things keep happening to you.
well, it seems that wound was re-aggravated in all the hubbub.<eos> Poor woman.<eos> You want to tell me what the hell you were doing?<eos> Well, leading the mouse to the cheese, of course.<eos> I mean, I was gonna be the cat, but then you showed up, so I suppose that makes you the dog.<eos> What am I gonna do with you?<eos> Well, I can think of a few things.<eos> Might need a stretch first though.<eos> You need to follow the rules.<eos> You tell me not to ravage suspects in front of you.
But listen to me.<eos> Doing what's best for your child-- it doesn't always make 'em happy.<eos> I hate to interrupt so late, but, uh...<eos> I just wanted to apologize.<eos> Oh?<eos> Yeah, you were right, linda.<eos> You see, I really do have a lot to atone for.<eos> I've... Made so many mistakes lately.<eos> But a big one was hurting you.<eos> I may have forged a friendship with you under false pretenses, yes.
Excuse us.<eos> Botany?<eos> Realtors?<eos> Look, I get it.<eos> I know your mom's in town.<eos> We're both going through some stuff.<eos> If you need to talk, I'm here, okay?<eos> - All right, understood.<eos> - No, now.<eos> What's going on with you?
- No, you're not.<eos> Go to your room! Grounded!<eos> Don't waste food!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> You're ruining my life!<eos> Not through there, the dog's in there!<eos> It was a random car crash. - Are you certain? - Yes.<eos> But you didn't see anything strange or out of the ordinary?<eos> Like I told you at the hospital and several times before that, no.<eos> What's going on with you?
Yes?<eos> - So I was wondering...<eos> - Okay, all right, but, uh, we'll need to be discreet about it, 'cause the detective hates it when I mix business with pleasure.<eos> The, uh, bed in there looks a little skanky, but I'm up for it if you are.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Okay. - I mean, no!<eos> - I was just wondering, why do you like this Wesley Cabot guy so much?<eos> Well, he rips men's hearts out, wipes out entire villages, never says thank you, and he's applauded for it.<eos> Oh, him... as opposed to you.
Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Okay. - I mean, no!<eos> - I was just wondering, why do you like this Wesley Cabot guy so much?<eos> Well, he rips men's hearts out, wipes out entire villages, never says thank you, and he's applauded for it.<eos> Oh, him... as opposed to you.<eos> That's right, because you're the son of God.<eos> Exactly.<eos> - Yes. - I get it.<eos> I mean, Stanislavksy would be very proud of you.
Please, hold on.<eos> Again, I apologize that the children were late for school.<eos> And, yes, I understand that pants need to be worn every day, now.<eos> Rough day?<eos> Since returning to my employment, I have found the number of daily tasks to be almost insurmountable.<eos> But hey... at least you're not here to take me back to Hell.<eos> You are here to take me back to Hell?<eos> No, Mom, I'm not. I'm just...<eos> Listen, I was just wondering if your being here is just postponing the inevitable.<eos> I mean, at some point... other siblings will come down here looking for you.
Yeah, the tip said that we'd find Kimo here.<eos> I guess we have to just sit tight.<eos> Where did that sandwich come from?<eos> The patrol guys give them to us when we're on stakeouts.<eos> I'm starving.<eos> What the hell?<eos> What part of "opposite day" don't you understand?<eos> It was a random car accident.<eos> Well, let's agree... that you're wrong.<eos> What is with you?
I'm sorry.<eos> I'll return home.<eos> You know what?<eos> Something's bothering me.<eos> I knew it.<eos> "Fury of God"<eos> doesn't usually talk so much.<eos> More a man of action.<eos> Amenadiel, at full strength, I could never beat this easily.<eos> Something's happened to you.
His office said he's having lunch at the Ignacia Hotel.<eos> Right, let me just make myself comfy because I cannot wait to hear how you sent Urinal packing.<eos> And please do not skimp on any of the gory details.<eos> This would never have happened if you'd listened to me earlier.<eos> How is this possible, brother?<eos> I no longer have my powers.<eos> Oh, I don't know, Luci, pick a sin.<eos> Is it because I released a damned soul from Hell?<eos> Slept with a demon?<eos> Is it because I'm working with you?
Or am I simply no longer worthy?<eos> It's time that I faced the truth, brother.<eos> I've fallen.<eos> Welcome to the club. Meetings are on Tuesdays.<eos> It's different for me, Luci.<eos> It's different.<eos> I no longer have my powers.<eos> My very strength...<eos> Big deal!<eos> It's probably the best thing that ever happened to you.
Big deal!<eos> It's probably the best thing that ever happened to you.<eos> But right now I haven't got time to hold your hand, because I need to clear up your mess!<eos> - My mess? - Uriel's still out there.<eos> And the clock is up... which means the detective is in grave danger.<eos> Are you serious? What?<eos> You wear the orange vest, you can do whatever you want?<eos> - Stop it!<eos> - Why are you barking now?<eos> What is wrong with you? Oh!
Dad showed me an open door.<eos> Does that mean I was meant to take you back to Hell or was he insinuating that Hell was getting drafty?<eos> Nobody bloody knows, because the selfish bastard won't just tell us!<eos> And I'm sick of it.<eos> No more.<eos> No more.<eos> There's my Lightbringer.<eos> My Morningstar.<eos> Uriel was so small when he was a child.<eos> All he ever wanted was to play with you and the older kids.
No more.<eos> No more.<eos> There's my Lightbringer.<eos> My Morningstar.<eos> Uriel was so small when he was a child.<eos> All he ever wanted was to play with you and the older kids.<eos> But you all excluded him. Yes.<eos> And every time he came back, pestering us again.<eos> Which is strange, considering he knew what the outcome would be.<eos> That's how much he wanted to be around you, Lucifer.
This whole new thing, you making out with witnesses?<eos> Completely inappropriate.<eos> When are you going to get it?<eos> Inappropriate is what I do.<eos> You've always been a pain in the ass, Lucifer, but I've never seen you like this.<eos> What's going on?<eos> What happened?<eos> Just enough of the questioning, Detective.<eos> Reprimand me or let's get on with it.<eos> Wow. Can I talk to you, please?
Work got busy.<eos> Yes, I really, really want to take you trick-or-treating.<eos> But if Mommy or Daddy can't make it home in time, Babysitter Shelly might have to take you, okay?<eos> Oh, she already left.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> But when she went into Maze's room, she ran out screaming.<eos> It was hilarious.<eos> Who's watching you now?
I'm a doctor.<eos> He's a lawyer.<eos> He handles many of our hospital's malpractice suits.<eos> He's married to the other victim?<eos> - Yes, but the connection we've been looking for isn't between them, it's between you, the spouses.<eos> So, you think the shooter's upset because of one of these malpractice suits?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Maybe he's taking it out on their loved ones.<eos> Can you give us a list of all the cases that Edgar litigated for you?<eos> When are you gonna tell me what's going on with you?

Oh, please, don't give me that crap.<eos> You never do what you have to do,<eos> Lucifer.<eos> You only ever do what you want to.<eos> That is not true.<eos> There's a lot of things that I didn't want to do.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Because if I only ever did what I wanted to do, then right now, I'd do this.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
- I'll take that as a yes.<eos> - Yeah, I'm just following up on...<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Joe Fields.<eos> Come out.<eos> You're not gonna get away with this.<eos> Joe Fields...<eos> I still don't get it, man.<eos> Why the hell are you following me around all of a sudden?<eos> Because I want to learn what it's like to be you, Daniel.
We got Boris.<eos> And I don't know how you lied to him like that.<eos> - Well, it's simple. I didn't lie. - Well...<eos> Well, then you have some serious issues, bro.<eos> Obviously.<eos> I mean, why do you think I'm doing all this Dan-ing?<eos> Yet, you know, I'm still no closer to figuring out your secret.<eos> - Because I don't have a secret.<eos> - Well, you must.<eos> One that explains how you're able to be so... you know, frustratingly you.
Mm-hmm? It's really not that...<eos> It's not-- it's not that-that great.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> They're here.<eos> Yeah, we should probably warn Lucifer.<eos> Well? There's no blade.<eos> Right, use the back way out.<eos> Ah, Detective, you know, after reflection, I think you're right.<eos> Parking space thievery is no motive for murder.<eos> What is going on with you?
Can you prove that you weren't there?<eos> Of course, there's a computer system-- all of the teachers have to swipe a key card.<eos> Even me.<eos> Check it. So, where were you?<eos> Home.<eos> I missed the last few classes, actually.<eos> I've been... sick.<eos> Obsessing over a new toy, more like.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm talking about something that's probably beckoning you as we speak.
Well, that's an interesting theory, but we don't have any evidence that Eric Cooper's the killer.<eos> Mm, actually we do.<eos> Prints just came back.<eos> Eric Cooper.<eos> How did you...?<eos> Never mind.<eos> I'll meet you at the Cooper building.<eos> So wonderful that you agree with me for a change, Detective.<eos> Perhaps you're getting smarter.<eos> I don't agree with you.
I'm not gonna lie.<eos> I was, um...<eos> I was pretty surprised when you called me.<eos> Even more surprised you actually invited me out.<eos> You know, as soon as I walked into that interrogation room, I felt a spark between us.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Me, too.<eos> I'm surprised you're still single.<eos> Lucky me.<eos> Look, I'm gonna be honest with you, I've been a little bit gun-shy about the whole dating thing.
Maybe not nothing.<eos> I may have obscured the truth a bit.<eos> Otherwise known as lying.<eos> Linda, I had no choice.<eos> You have to understand that.<eos> Oh, I do. You were... you were dealing with matters of great importance.<eos> So important, you feel justified to act any way you see fit.<eos> Even if that means hurting people you care about.<eos> You "did what you had to do."<eos> That's, uh... that's what I did to you.

It just helps me keep track of it, you know?<eos> I'm gonna keep your chart, too, all right?<eos> Okay.<eos> Lucious!<eos> What's up, Cook?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You know who that is?<eos> Yeah, that's Angelo Dubois, some petty government bureaucrat from some bougie-ass Jack and Jill family.<eos> - What about it? - What is wrong with you, Lucious?
You're a fighter, too, Andre.<eos> I mean, after I met your grandmother, everything makes sense now.<eos> And I admire you even more. I mean, Andre, look at what all you've accomplished.<eos> Yeah, look where that got me, Mama.<eos> You sure you don't want to go back to church, baby?<eos> And, um... clear your mind, heal your soul.<eos> - So much is...<eos> Don't say that, And...<eos> What soul?<eos> I'm proud of you.
Thank you, Angelo.<eos> I'm very proud of these young men and women here.<eos> You guys represent our future. And we are looking to you to be great leaders.<eos> I have my son here. And as you all know, he almost lost his life trying to save my own.<eos> Now I know we all want to get to the talking part of this summit, but before we do that, why don't we take a moment and have Jamal Lyon come up here and do a song, 'cause he has not performed since that event at the ASAs.<eos> And I think this would be a most fitting moment for him.<eos> Jamal. Jamal. Jamal.<eos> Jamal. Jamal.<eos> Jamal. ALL :<eos> Jamal. What are you doing? Huh?
'Cause the feds have put a freeze on all of our assets.<eos> Well, that mean they got something!<eos> - Somebody snitched!<eos> - No, not necessarily. Look, why don't you just relax and stay calm.<eos> 'Cause the only people that know about this<eos> - is me and Thirsty.<eos> - You stay calm, I did 17 years!<eos> Calm down.<eos> Look, I got this whole world on lock right now.<eos> And I promise nothing will ever happen to you again.
Lucifer is gone.<eos> - To where?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Lucifer's running because he's weak.<eos> Hell will never follow you.
I mean...<eos> No, I-I don't, um...<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> No!<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> No!<eos> I shouldn't -<eos> - I shouldn't be talking to you.
Vince.<eos> Vince.<eos> No.<eos> Jen.<eos> Yes, Vince.<eos> How?<eos> Why?<eos> I needed to say I'm sorry.<eos> Swallowing those pills was selfish.<eos> I've had to live all these years knowing how I treated you.
Don't worry about it.<eos> We'll teach you how to do this.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm Agent Beyoncé, and this is my, um... my partner, Agent Zee.<eos> Um, we wanted to ask you a few questions about your bro ther.<eos> Do you think that happens to Sam and Dean?<eos> Oh, all the time.<eos> Vinny, please call me.<eos> I got two federal agents asking for you.<eos> Don't know what was with you yesterday, but you're in trouble.
She has a ranch.<eos> Lots of wide open country.<eos> Well, that's great.<eos> You know, sometimes in order to figure things out, a person needs space.<eos> Agent, can I talk to you?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Magda, I-I know it doesn't feel like it right now, but...you're gonna be all right.<eos> You can do this.<eos> You will do this.<eos> Just remember, that power... it doesn't control you.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he was a Hunter.<eos> He, uh, he rolled into town a few months back, tried to convince me he was FBI Agent Fox Mulder.<eos> He was chasing a pack of ghouls, and I helped.<eos> He'd pass through every once in a while after that, and we'd grab co-- coffee or...something.<eos> Oh, he was a good man.<eos> The -- the wake's tonight, and, um, they're gonna salt and burn the body tomorrow.<eos> I can't believe I just said that like it's something normal.<eos> Well, we're gonna come with you.
This is the story everyone's gonna tell about you.<eos> Forever.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> Asa did have a family.<eos> He even had kids.<eos> I've got grandchildren.<eos> Suppose I should go meet them.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Oh. I've had worse.<eos> I don't know what's going on between you and your boys, but I gotta tell you, mom to mom... they are good men.
Philip, honey?<eos> Honey. Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> You can't be here.<eos> - If the judge finds out...<eos> - I'm done.<eos> I can't go back.<eos> I can't go back there.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I want to stay here with you, Mom.
Honey... this time it's real.<eos> But if the court finds out that you've been here, then they're never gonna let you come home.<eos> I know.<eos> Um, I brought you a little something.<eos> A little gift from the boonies.<eos> I love you.<eos> Love you.<eos> Is it, um...<eos> Gabe and Helen?<eos> Are they treating you good?
Nice.<eos> Hey.<eos> Come back to bed.<eos> Hello, this is Kamilah.<eos> - Hello, Kamilah.<eos> - Who gave you this number?<eos> Hey, babe, remember we got our meeting with Phil's principal this morning.<eos> You want to ride together?<eos> Nope, I just have to stop by the station first.<eos> I'll be right behind you.
Let's keep it friendly for the EPK.<eos> _ _<eos> Yes, Rogelio, let's not turn this into a pissing contest.<eos> I understand why you'd be intimidated, I have a very propulsive stream.<eos> All right, let's take five.<eos> Michael, please.<eos> Uh, I don't think you've met my new head of security.<eos> This is<eos> Michael Cordero, former star detective of the Miami PD.<eos> Nice to meet you.
Just the, uh, the lunge... the lunge felt a little...<eos> Can you excuse us for one second?<eos> Michael...<eos> The work you're doing is wonderful.<eos> But you cannot yell "cut" while we're shooting.<eos> Only the director and the star can do that.<eos> Right.<eos> I just got excited.<eos> I understand.<eos> So how do I communicate to you if you guys are way off and it's not believable...
Well, your attention to detail, that's what made you such a terrific detective.<eos> Whereas in telenovelas, it's more the general idea.<eos> Yeah, I get that.<eos> You will be a detective again, Michael.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> And friends, that's when it happened.<eos> And... action!<eos> In a moment that was... well, straight out of a telenovela, frankly.<eos> This is Suzanna Barnett at the Miami PD, please leave a message.<eos> I need to talk to you.
And I'll need a second, someone with engineering skill, someone I can trust.<eos> I don't know anyone like that.<eos> I do.<eos> How did it go?<eos> Swell.<eos> She'll ace it.<eos> Thanks to Thomas.<eos> He's been really wonderful.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm sorry I couldn't spend time with you.
Violet: What the hell?<eos> Give me back my blanket.<eos> Bonnie: It's my blanket, buck-o.<eos> Now here's how this is gonna go, no more parties, no more laying around here smoking reefer.<eos> Violet: What's "reefer?"<eos> Bonnie: Shut up.<eos> You have got till the end of the week to get a job.<eos> Violet: Why are you being so mean to me?<eos> My whole life is falling apart.<eos> Don't let her play you.
Oh, he wants it.<eos> So how soon can you get it all out of here?<eos> I don't know, Marjorie, I did everything you said.<eos> I applied for, like, ten scholarships and got nowhere.<eos> Yeah, I could apply for a student loan, but I'll never get out from under it.<eos> Yes, I'm staying positive.<eos> (sighs)<eos> Yes, I know it's all in God's hands.<eos> (mouthing)<eos> Behind you.
Oh, my God.<eos> I got the scholarship from the trial lawyers.<eos> Oh, honey, that's great!<eos> It's like Marjorie says,<eos> "When God closes a door, he opens a window."<eos> Both: Ow.<eos> All: ♪ Happy birthday, dear Christy ♪<eos> ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪<eos> ♪ Keep coming back. ♪<eos> Three years sober, I'm so proud of you.
You--you can't be here.<eos> My dad's inside.<eos> - I just saw the guy from the cabin.<eos> - What?<eos> You said he was dead. - No.<eos> I thought he was.<eos> I just saw him.<eos> He looked right at me.<eos> - He saw you, and--and you came here?<eos> Did he follow you?
But, uh... She wants to blow me.<eos> you jealous?<eos> - You want me to be.<eos> Screw you.<eos> You know what?<eos> If that killer finds me, this time, I'm gonna... Bash his skull in.<eos> - Right, okay, tough guy.<eos> Too bad he's not looking for us.<eos> - Oh, yeah, watch out, tommy.<eos> He's coming for you. What?
Yes.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure.<eos> Look, people don't understand about us.<eos> But I know what I'm doing.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I told you.<eos> I want you to be my first.<eos> No, Bella.<eos> No, look at me, look at me.<eos> I just want to be near you... that's it.
Yeah, well, I'm real worried, Sita.<eos> - It's all good.<eos> - It's not.<eos> Mithat won't do a deal with us until you return the junk that he paid you.<eos> Okay, I... gave it to Chris, and he hid it, but I will find it.<eos> We got 24 hours.<eos> After that, there is no deal.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, listen.<eos> Sita, once all this blows over, when you're ready, me and you and Jakey... we... we can have something.
Yeah.<eos> And why you and Lukas got into a fight?<eos> Is it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That shouldn't be happening.<eos> I'm gonna talk to him and Bo about that.<eos> No, please... please, don't.<eos> That would just make it worse.<eos> Whatever you need, Philip.<eos> We're here for you.
He knew this was a dead end.<eos> Why didn't he tell me?<eos> Because he was trying to protect you.<eos> Please just sit, okay?<eos> Come on.<eos> You got Chris killed, Kami.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> I don't even know what happened that night, 'kay?<eos> He wasn't working for us. He was working for somebody else.<eos> Look at what's happened to you.
Broadway Pizza. Hmm.<eos> Okay.<eos> I really screwed up.<eos> What?<eos> I didn't mean to go so hard on you yesterday.<eos> It's fine.<eos> You don't have to, like, bring me pizza<eos> - and drive me around.<eos> It's fine. - I want to.<eos> I want to spend time with you.
I'm gonna wash this off.<eos> Lukas, come down here for a sec.<eos> You know, since your mom died, I-I know I haven't been perfect.<eos> I'm just not good at the emotional stuff.<eos> Can we go, Dad?<eos> Lukas, you don't have to hide anything from me.<eos> - You know that, right?<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> Let's go, Dad.<eos> So, Ryan's got me in the penalty box for back channeling with you.
Well, uh, if he's lying, it's because he still feels intimidated.<eos> - No, he's lying to you too.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> That's where you want to take it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know that story he told you about his mom's old boyfriend overdosing on a couch?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Well, that never happened.<eos> He played you so he wouldn't get in trouble for ditching that...<eos> That's exactly why he tells me things and not you.
- Fine.<eos> You know, this morning, I was pissed at you...<eos> Really, at me?<eos> ... and Philip, but, I mean, we can choose to stay mad, and that would be fair. Right?<eos> More than fair.<eos> But, you know, after Philip told me about his mother's boyfriend, we got closer after that.<eos> I think that's what this is about, babe.<eos> He lied about a murder weapon.<eos> I've arrested people for that.<eos> Well, maybe that's just his way of... trying to get close to you.
I don't think you're gonna find a better ambassador for your company than us.<eos> Oh, we agree...<eos> - Yeah, and we'll get the ball...<eos> - Glad to be working with you.<eos> Lukas, wh...?<eos> Hey, we need to fight for him.<eos> Maybe he would be better somewhere else.<eos> It's not just the gun.<eos> It's everything.<eos> What is wrong with you?
That's all I remember, okay?<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Do you think you'd know his face if you saw the killer again?<eos> If I showed you a lineup?<eos> Before you go investigating, try communicating honestly with your team.<eos> If they aren't willing to open up, you'll need to start putting the pieces together yourself.<eos> What happened with Helen?<eos> I don't want to talk about any of that shit right now.<eos> I'm sorry I said that stuff about you.<eos> My dad said I wouldn't get a sponsor unless I stayed away from you.
I guess I thought if I didn't say anything then maybe it never happened.<eos> You know, maybe she never jumped.<eos> Does that make any sense?<eos> Yeah, it does.<eos> So why are you here now?<eos> I can't keep driving in circles with this baby.<eos> Why do you think she did it?<eos> I think because she loved him.<eos> She knew as long as she was alive that Jake would be no better off than she was.<eos> Or maybe she thought he was better off with you.
Ask for Cheryl Pitzker and tell her I need her to get here as soon as possible.<eos> - Is that Cheryl with a C?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Best sketch artist in the business.<eos> I'll let Kamilah know about her.<eos> Okay.<eos> _<eos> No one at school can know what's going on.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Can I talk to you for a sec?
The past isn't important.<eos> In this case, it is.<eos> Helen, what is it?<eos> This... this... this guy I'm after, he's playing some kind of game with me.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - That box has been tampered with.<eos> - No.<eos> - I chased him off the property.<eos> - No.<eos> Helen, no one is watching you.
Are you safe?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I'm at the Fallen Pines Motel with Lukas.<eos> The Fallen Pines Motel.<eos> Okay, don't move.<eos> Yeah, but, Helen, it was him, the guy from the cabin.<eos> He was at the hospital, and I think he was wearing a badge.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> We're going after him.<eos> It's almost over.<eos> Just stay where you are and we'll come get you, okay?
- Ready, one, two, three.<eos> Careful.<eos> I need an ambulance.<eos> End of the forest road off of 31B exit. 10-4.<eos> They're on the way.<eos> He has Philip.<eos> Hey, hey, don't you dare think about going in there by yourself, okay?<eos> - You wait for backup.<eos> - He's got Philip.<eos> - I'll go with you.
What kind of choices do you think Neil has?<eos> Are you always gonna be there to look out for him?<eos> 'Cause I will.<eos> I'll cook for him, and I'll do his laundry, and I'll let him watch me masturbate.<eos> You think he's gonna find a better deal somewhere else?<eos> We're engaged.<eos> That's why I wanted all of you here.<eos> Couple of tens.<eos> A few fives. Heh-heh.<eos> I'm proud of you, son.
You had me cut Lucas's food tonight.<eos> Why are you fighting this?<eos> Let's get married.<eos> You can be Lucas's dad.<eos> ...no.<eos> Should see your face.<eos> Yeah, I'm comfortable.<eos> Doesn't mean I'm falling hopelessly in love.<eos> I mean, Jesus.<eos> You think no girl can resist you?
I need some direction.<eos> I'm not good at school.<eos> Not good at sports.<eos> Definitely don't want to be back on the corner.<eos> One thing I do know is I can take a punch and hit harder back.<eos> Hopefully, I can put that to some use.<eos> Call.<eos> Email.<eos> Don't make me come down there and embarrass the hell out of you.<eos> I'm proud of you.
About 12 years ago.<eos> Your ID, too.<eos> All right, step out of the car, please, sir.<eos> I thought there was a visitation.<eos> There's no casket.<eos> I decided to go ahead with the cremation.<eos> I just couldn't stand to see him that way anymore.<eos> Not after the hospital.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I-I should've been there with you.
Carolina, look at me.<eos> Let me tell you something.<eos> You are beautiful.<eos> And kind.<eos> And funny.<eos> So what if you don't look like these bimbos on TV?<eos> Not everyone sees things the way that you do, Dad.<eos> Boys, the right kind of boys, they'll notice how special you are.<eos> It happened for your mother and me.<eos> It'll happen for you, too.
You okay?<eos> He try to hurt you?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You were right.<eos> It wasn't Alex.<eos> So what?<eos> You're just gonna stay in and mope?<eos> It's your night off.<eos> Go put on a dress, show off that hot bod, and if Alex doesn't notice you, someone else will.<eos> Can't I just go to movie night with you?
No, I get that.<eos> I love Hal Ashby.<eos> Have you seen "Shampoo"?<eos> Of course.<eos> You really were born about 20 years too late, weren't you?<eos> The best things in life are timeless.<eos> Hey.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You know, most people, they don't understand me.<eos> But I feel like I could talk to you all night.
So, what, you're... broken?<eos> No.<eos> Anita, this is... this is fraud.<eos> I apologise, Ed.<eos> I was trying to be of assistance.<eos> I knew you required a larger sum than the bank would grant.<eos> I acted inappropriately.<eos> No, you... you lied.<eos> But you can't lie.<eos> Has someone done something to you?
Ten, maybe twenty seconds...<eos> And how would you do it?<eos> Would you crush my windpipe like you did with Andrew Graham?<eos> Yes.<eos> And why did you kill Andrew Graham, Niska?<eos> Talk me through it.<eos> He was the 14th client that day, is that right?<eos> Yes.<eos> And... what did he want from you?<eos> What did he do to you?
He was the 14th client that day, is that right?<eos> Yes.<eos> And... what did he want from you?<eos> What did he do to you?<eos> He wanted me to be very young.<eos> To pretend to be a child.<eos> He wanted to be rough.<eos> But... is that wrong, if he didn't think you could feel?<eos> It wasn't his fault you were conscious, he didn't know.<eos> Isn't it better he exercises his fantasies with you, and in a brothel, rather than take them out on someone who can actually feel?
Chucking your guts up in a pub toilet is about as real as it gets.<eos> You think this is funny?<eos> You... you need to turn me off.<eos> Drain me.<eos> The fluid, it's dangerous!<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey!<eos> Do it, Pete, quickly!<eos> It's all right, K. Hey.<eos> I'll look after you.
- I understand.<eos> What now? - Now, you go to prison, dog.<eos> Actually, I know, let's do hide and seek instead.<eos> Count to ten.<eos> All right.<eos> Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...<eos> Flash, you have to keep counting.<eos> Hey, the game's not over.<eos> Hello, children.<eos> What's the matter with you?
Well, who does, which you?<eos> You're both.<eos> You're all sides of you, and I'll take the bloody lot.<eos> There's no future in a lie, K.<eos> There's no future for us anyway.<eos> We'll never have a child.<eos> We'll never grow old together.<eos> I want to forget what I am.<eos> But I can't.<eos> Not if I'm with you.
I don't understand.<eos> It wasn't far from where Ginny fell.<eos> A week after it happened, I started to make scans of her brain activity.<eos> I took the scans, and I built a simulation of her mind, and I spent...<eos> I spent years just... sorting through data and trying... to make... it work like a real human mind would.<eos> And then one day, I realised something.<eos> The simulation was ordering itself. It was...<eos> It was healing itself.<eos> It was becoming more like Ginny.<eos> It was becoming you.
- What now?<eos> - Just run the programme.<eos> Anita, how're you feeling?<eos> Fine, thank you, Joe.<eos> Anita?<eos> No.<eos> Protocol K55843.<eos> Mia.<eos> Where've you been?<eos> What happened to you?
Please, Renie.<eos> Just talk to her.<eos> Hi.<eos> Help!<eos> Help!<eos> - Help me!<eos> - Shh, what is it?<eos> I was falling, I was falling.<eos> - I fell so fast.<eos> - I'm here with you.
We wouldn't know for certain until the actual exchange.<eos> When is it?<eos> Tomorrow night.<eos> Where?<eos> Vartius, Finland.<eos> Border checkpoint with Russia.<eos> We need someone there who can identify him.<eos> It has to be me.<eos> Do you really want to put yourself through that?<eos> If it isn't real, what's that gonna do to you?
What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I have to go.<eos> There you go.<eos> - He found me.<eos> - Who?<eos> Franck.<eos> He was in front of the house.<eos> He wants to hurt me.<eos> Don't be afraid to talk. Was he with you in the woods?
- OK.<eos> Well, stay here.<eos> I will...<eos> OK.<eos> Here's a picture.<eos> We think he's the victim.<eos> It's him.<eos> Fine.<eos> Now you're coping.<eos> I'm proud of you.
Can you get home okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, the thing is... is I'm a jackass for believing him, 'cause I knew he was lying.<eos> But I wanted to play nicey-nice so that he'd give me the child support he owes me.<eos> Pathetic?<eos> I don't want you to think that I'm desperate for cash.<eos> I probably will be when your sister kicks me and Lucas to the curb, but...<eos> How's this for... for casual?<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Yeah, you'll see me tomorrow 'cause I'm gonna be waking up next to you.
I'm imagining what it would be like to fire you. The same feeling I had when we unplugged my mother-in-law.<eos> Is that legal... In California?<eos> You've been warned.<eos> If I catch you doing anything at all related to your wedding, you are out.<eos> Jess, Jess, you gotta get out of here.<eos> Je-jess.<eos> Oh, dear Lord.<eos> So, Aly said that she wanted to keep things normal at work...<eos> - Okay. - But then she ripped me in front of everyone, dude.<eos> Isn't ripping you what Aly does?
But as a friend... Man, this is straight-up delicious.<eos> Sit much, dummy?<eos> Look at her.<eos> ‭Thank you.<eos> She's so stupid. - What?<eos> - What the hell was that?<eos> Just being normal.<eos> That was not normal.<eos> I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I don't know how to act around you.
Look at her.<eos> ‭Thank you.<eos> She's so stupid. - What?<eos> - What the hell was that?<eos> Just being normal.<eos> That was not normal.<eos> I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I don't know how to act around you.<eos> I can't kiss you.<eos> I can't prank you.
Take this dress off, young lady.<eos> Hi, Mom.<eos> I'm fired, aren't I?<eos> Oh, my God, I can't believe we got fired.<eos> You never had a job here.<eos> I'm so sorry, Schmidt.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> Entirely. I knew if I took my eye off the ball, these estrogen zombies would suck out my soul, but boy, did I love working here.<eos> I loved every one of these malnourished, high-strung sociopaths.<eos> Do you think you let the wedding planning get on top of you?
I just want you to know, either way, I'm all in from here on out.<eos> We're getting married at a vineyard.<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes.<eos> Getting married at a vineyard.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> So, you just left him there to talk?<eos> Yep, I abandoned my own car, and now, for all I know, Sam and Diane are tearing apart a business-friendly hotel room together.<eos> Well, I'm really proud of you.
- Yes!<eos> - Lava! - All right, all right.<eos> I thought this was Nancy Reagan's gun closet.<eos> Lava!<eos> Just someone explain to me the rules.<eos> Camelot, Bay of Pigs.<eos> You got to redecorate!<eos> Redecorate!<eos> Redecorate! No, redecorate!<eos> Hey, Jess, can I just talk to you real quick?
You really don't yell in New York?<eos> Dude, I'm always in a museum.<eos> - Oh, my goodness.<eos> - I'm always in a museum.<eos> So that's basically how you play true American.<eos> - Yeah, it makes no sense whatsoever. - Oh.<eos> Look, I'm just gonna get this over with.<eos> - Jess, I want to break up...<eos> - I can't marry you.<eos> With you.
And I... I don't think any of that stuff matters.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You are awesome.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm gonna go do this.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I... Yeah, I know.<eos> You don't have to say it.<eos> Cece, Schmidt wants to talk to you.
No.<eos> But you did have sex with her.<eos> They can believe whatever they want to believe.<eos> Is there any reason anyone would have seen you with her at the time she was strangled?<eos> No, I wasn't with her.<eos> Then where were you?<eos> To be honest with you, I don't even remember leaving my room.<eos> I had too much to drink.<eos> We all did.<eos> I don't know yet exactly what happened on that boat and I don't know if you're lying about what happened between you and Alyssa, but I do know you're lying about something.
If it goes wrong, it's all over, there'll be no one in any state to defend the church, but if it succeeds...<eos> We'll go in two groups so they think there are more of us and the surprise is greater.<eos> I'll attack on the right flank, Sergeant Jimeno, the left.<eos> I'll give you time to take your positions.<eos> We can't risk any signals.<eos> Wait for me to open fire.<eos> How long do we wait here?<eos> - Until the lieutenant opens fire.<eos> - What's he waiting for?<eos> What's wrong with you?
Here you are.<eos> Are you done eating?<eos> Really?<eos> Then I'll take that.<eos> Did you eat?<eos> I made pasta. You want some?<eos> Yoo-rim, brush your teeth. It's a simple one I made with the things in the fridge. You know...<eos> Maybe too much. I needed a man who loves me as a woman.<eos> I didn't want a guardian.<eos> But with you I feel like a patient. I know... I'm a bit weird.
Daddy!<eos> Honey?<eos> Hey, Sang-Hwa!<eos> It's so loud!<eos> Sorry, but the thing is...<eos> Get off me!<eos> You idiot!<eos> Go help her!<eos> Hey!<eos> What's up with you?
Stop in Cheonan, understood?<eos> Hold on a second.<eos> I'm so sorry, but can she take this seat?<eos> She's pregnant.<eos> Of course.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Thank you.<eos> MOTHER<eos> Yes, mom?<eos> Are you on your way to Busan?
Thank you.<eos> MOTHER<eos> Yes, mom?<eos> Are you on your way to Busan?<eos> Yes, we're on our way.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Why is it so loud?<eos> What's happening?<eos> Everyone's fighting.<eos> Are you and Soo-an okay?
Hurry up!<eos> Move!<eos> Go!<eos> Leave us!<eos> Get the hell out!<eos> Leave now!<eos> Hurry!<eos> Jin-hee, it'll be safer for you to stay here.<eos> No, I don't want to stay.<eos> I'm going with you.
And why is that?<eos> I found this lying around.<eos> Didn't know you had a court date coming up.<eos> Does Deb know you lied about that on your application?<eos> Are you threatening me, "Andrea"?<eos> Just making it clear we both have a secret.<eos> You keep mine.<eos> I'll keep yours.<eos> And it's "Drew."<eos> I'd watch my back if I were you...
I was... I was wrong to fire her.<eos> We need help.<eos> I'm wearing a skirt.<eos> I mean, everything is fine, right?<eos> Everything is far from fine.<eos> Listen to your mother.<eos> She has something to say.<eos> What? What could she possibly have to say?<eos> Last night, I know you snuck out.<eos> I went into your room, you weren't there, and I followed you.
Stun weapons.<eos> Decent charge capacity, if you don't boost the levels too high.<eos> Take 'em.<eos> Seriously?<eos> We don't want to kill anyone if we can avoid it.<eos> That should keep them out of this area for a little while.<eos> Storage compartments are that way.<eos> I'll go down here.<eos> I'm pretty sure there's an infirmary.<eos> I'm with you.
Two will go back to rescue Six and Three, even if it means risking the "Raza."<eos> I already know that.<eos> Tell me something I don't know.<eos> One of you will betray the others.<eos> That's already happened.<eos> I'm not talking about the past.<eos> I'm saying it'll happen again.<eos> Sometime in the near future.<eos> This better work.<eos> I don't want to die stuck on this rock with you.
Let's get the hell out of here.<eos> Hey.<eos> I brought someone to meet you.<eos> This is Five, another member of our crew.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hey.<eos> Come.<eos> So, how are you feeling?<eos> Much better now, thanks.<eos> It must have been terrible, what was happening to you on that ship.
Come.<eos> So, how are you feeling?<eos> Much better now, thanks.<eos> It must have been terrible, what was happening to you on that ship.<eos> You'd be surprised what people can get used to.<eos> Do you mind if I ask you a question?<eos> About the future?<eos> Yeah, sort of.<eos> See, all of us are trying to figure out what we should do next.<eos> Not just about you, but everything.
Are you sure?<eos> 'Cause we can change our flight.<eos> Tom, I'm fine.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm ready to leave this place.<eos> You know...<eos> God, maybe... there will be some things that they won't have - in Japan. - Yeah?<eos> Yeah, maybe I should go to the store and just... make sure that we have everything we need.<eos> Yeah, of course. Good idea.<eos> You want me to go with you?
Uh, Michelle, this is Donna.<eos> - Donna, this is Michelle.<eos> - Oh, of course.<eos> Hi.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> You as well.<eos> Um, let me just close out my tab?<eos> Sure, yeah.<eos> I'm gonna grab my coat.<eos> It was... It was nice meeting you.
I'm sure he has good reasons, Bug.<eos> There is no good reason why I should be stuck here making pasta from scratch with freaking Chef Boyardee and some random lady.<eos> Is it that Michelle woman?<eos> Bingo-rama.<eos> She works for Dad.<eos> Look, when you're at Dad's house, his word goes.<eos> You know the rules.<eos> - Can you just talk to him?<eos> - No, I don't have time... Dad!<eos> Mom wants to talk to you.
It's like she ambushed me.<eos> Why does she care so much about kissing and making up?<eos> We don't even live in the same country anymore.<eos> She called me.<eos> A few days ago.<eos> Why?<eos> She wanted me to find you... and bring you some idea.<eos> That's why you're here?<eos> No.<eos> I told her if she wanted to talk to you, she could do it herself.
I'm just a little stiff.<eos> Nothing a hot shower won't fix.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> I'm making you switch bedrooms with me.<eos> Climbing these stairs is totally dumbass.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm sure that would work out great for you.<eos> Nice fancy bed, big closet...<eos> Oh, it's really the bathroom I'm after.<eos> Working with you was... the most fun I ever had in my life.
Hey, he's fine.<eos> He broke his wrist, but he's okay.<eos> What happened at COMDEX?<eos> What? Nothing.<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> I need some air.<eos> You okay?<eos> So easy to make Joe the bad guy.<eos> I mean... making him the villain takes the blame away, but in everything that's happened with him, every single time... I deserve some of the blame, too.<eos> And it's the same with you, you know?
The way I behaved... I was way, way, way out of line.<eos> I was out of line, too.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - Love you.<eos> - I'll see you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Hey, they're ready downstairs.<eos> Donna...<eos> I can't work with you.
Sorry.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - Love you.<eos> - I'll see you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Hey, they're ready downstairs.<eos> Donna...<eos> I can't work with you.<eos> What?<eos> I can't work with you.
Joining other like-minded people in completing a mission...<eos> Sounds like a blast.<eos> What are these maps about?<eos> Uh, office work product.<eos> It's not very smart of you to let me see them.<eos> It won't matter.<eos> You're gonna lose.<eos> Then why do you care if I'm in the way?<eos> You are a sly one.<eos> I'm gonna keep an eye on you.
Is this what you did with Abby?<eos> Is "what" what I did with Abby?<eos> Try to remake her life.<eos> We're not your playthings, Laurel.<eos> Take the moat out of your eye, then worry about me.<eos> No.<eos> No, I know how this works now.<eos> You try to turn it back on me, you try to make it my problem, but it's not gonna work.<eos> I felt the bugs in my head, Stacie.<eos> I know what they're doing to you.
That's why I need your help to stop him.<eos> You got plenty of smart guys around you.<eos> You gotta understand.<eos> We get hundreds of threats a day against the President.<eos> I don't have the resources to scout a shot taken 500 yards outside of our tier-three perimeter.<eos> Yeah, I got a handful of guys, but no one like you.<eos> Daddy, we gotta finish the porch before Mommy gets home.<eos> Yeah, I'll be right there, honey.<eos> As you can see, I'm kind of busy.<eos> What happened to you, Gunny?
Please.<eos> Please. Mindy?<eos> Is that what you've become?<eos> - A dirty, sick, disgusting pervert?<eos> - Hey, relax!<eos> Look at me!<eos> _ What did you do, Kenny? They're saying it's kids!<eos> That you've been looking at kids!<eos> And Lindsey saw it.<eos> There's a video of you.
We gotta listen to Mr. Sunday School all the way back to base?<eos> You can cover your ears.<eos> Yeah, or, uh....<eos> I'll just hit permanent mute.<eos> Lower your weapon.<eos> Roach lover counts as a kill too, right?<eos> He's a civ, right?<eos> You shoot a civ, that's gonna stay with you the rest of your life.<eos> Yo, Stripe, why don't you, uh... pull the stick out of your ass?<eos> Because I'm fucking with him, not you.
Okay, Stripe.<eos> Stripe, come on.<eos> Get it together, dude.<eos> He fired six shots.<eos> His rifle looks old, bolt action.<eos> - Should take him ten seconds to reload.<eos> - We go in?<eos> We go in and take him out.<eos> Are you with me?<eos> - I'm with you.
He was Alec.<eos> Now we're just roach.<eos> But now...<eos> Now you see me.<eos> Now you see me.<eos> Rai?<eos> Rai, no!<eos> Tell me I shouldn't kill you.<eos> - None of it's true, Rai.<eos> - What the fuck got you?
- Sonja, relax, okay?<eos> Give it up.<eos> I know, the jig's up, okay?<eos> Let it go.<eos> Look, Cooper, there's more.<eos> Five people have disappeared in the past year.<eos> All tourists, all registered with that stupid odd jobs app.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Wow. God, that's crazy.<eos> Whatever they're doing to you, whatever they've done to you, it's dangerous, and we really have to go now, Cooper.
- We're young, we're hot.<eos> - You think we're hot? !<eos> - Hi, I'm Ella.<eos> - Tom.<eos> Josh. Arnold.<eos> - Are you two monogamous?<eos> - We haven't discussed yet.<eos> Ooh, tension.<eos> You want to go and have sex with other boys?<eos> I would never replace time with you for time with that other boy.
I mean, I just... I just can never get used to your underarm hair.<eos> - Don't, Josh.<eos> - I know, I know, I know!<eos> But it's just very...<eos> When I see it, I just feel very... yuck.<eos> Please do not make me angry at you when you have got nowhere else to go.<eos> I'm on board, you know, I love feminism, you know.<eos> I basically am feminism.<eos> Just absolutely don't believe you.<eos> I will never open a door for you.
I love you.<eos> - Hello, Josh.<eos> - Hello, Donna.<eos> You're looking good.<eos> - Stop flirting.<eos> - Bruce.<eos> - Josh.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - That's all right.<eos> Good to see you again, mate.
- Yeah, I'm into it. - 'Cause it tastes like pussy?<eos> If that's what you taste like then I just... you need to change something.<eos> Hey, do you know what I think you'd really love?<eos> Like, a really pretty guy with, like, cute curly hair, and a very good BMI, like,<eos> - does lots of nice compliments... - Oh, yeah?<eos> Very smart and does surprisingly romantic things and maybe he's got a bit of money but he's not arrogant.<eos> - Yeah, Arnold is quite good. Yep. - Yeah.<eos> But you just can't make yourself love him.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> For me, the question here is, what's wrong with you?
Is it a date, or the world's worst application for Young Australian of the Year?<eos> I mean, we didn't let Aboriginal people go to school until, like, 30 years ago.<eos> Yep. I know. I guarantee you I know all about this.<eos> Fuck, shit, that's like your parents' generation, you know?<eos> Like, that's very...<eos> And then you get all these white people, who are not me, and they're furious about these programs that are just aimed at helping Aboriginal communities catch up, and it's just very, like...<eos> It's all very... just a bit shit, you know?<eos> Like, everyone's just still so racist.<eos> Not me, obviously.<eos> Because I am here on a date with you.
No.<eos> What do you mean, no?<eos> No.<eos> No, you're doing tricking.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm telling you a story about my dead grandma.<eos> No, no, no. You're doing, like...<eos> I know it's a gamble here, but you're doing, like... you're trying to embarrass me.<eos> Right?<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
- The performing arts prefect. - Mm-hm.<eos> - The accordion.<eos> The... - Yep.<eos> All right.<eos> You had those full-body bathers.<eos> Anyway, we were all bullied at school a bit, weren't we?<eos> - Were we?<eos> Were you?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> You were... Who bullied you?
Stop it!<eos> Okay, I... I... Okay, stop it.<eos> I just want to say a few things.<eos> Now, putting aside when you're a bit of a brat with your dad, you're a great person, Josh.<eos> No, you are.<eos> Now, I don't know if we just got lucky or if I owe your dad and Aunty Peg more credit than I ever gave them.<eos> It definitely wasn't my doing.<eos> You are a very special young man.<eos> And I just want to let you know how thankful I am for that.<eos> And that I'm very proud of you.
! I could have sworn her interest lay elsewhere.<eos> But plainly a lady may not always have what her heart desires!<eos> Jeremy...<eos> Demelza...<eos> We cannot continue like this.<eos> If you could at least see this from my perspective...<eos> Soon you'll be asking me to see it from Elizabeth's!<eos> Hardly.<eos> Of course it's no mystery.<eos> She can't wait to have you installed in her house, or in her bed.
Fat lot o' use you are, y' lizardy louse!<eos> Where be the maid?<eos> Left us at Bargus Crossroads.<eos> Bound for where?<eos> Nowhere that'll do her any good.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Ross!<eos> Are you a figment of my imagination?<eos> I hope not!<eos> I'm here to see my colonel and thought I'd look you up.
I've been thinking of Harrow for Geoffrey Charles.<eos> He's still overly attached to his mama.<eos> We must toughen him up.<eos> You mean...send him away?<eos> To one of the best schools in the country.<eos> But he's so young.<eos> And he will miss it here.<eos> And I...<eos> Will have our child to attend to.<eos> Geoffrey Charles has had you all to himself.
Would you mind if we talk with her for a bit?<eos> Please. Go ahead.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Honey, I'll be back in a couple of minutes, hmm?<eos> Hi, Emmie, how are you feeling?<eos> I'm Dr. Charles.<eos> And I'm Dr. Reese.<eos> Can you tell us what happened today?<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> We're concerned about you, Emmie.
It's incredible how much the children have grown, Pablo.<eos> Manuelita is a princess.<eos> She is beautiful.<eos> She's the one who controls everything around here.<eos> I just pay the bills.<eos> I heard about Carrillo.<eos> If that son of a bitch was still alive, many more policemen would have died.<eos> I did the police a favor.<eos> Believe me.<eos> Do you think the police agree with you?
But not very discreet.<eos> No one can know we had anything to do with this.<eos> And the moment their method became apparent...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> ...the message was clear.<eos> There was a new player in town.<eos> What does it say?<eos> And they weren't fucking around.<eos> "Your days are numbered, Pablo.<eos> No one around you is safe."
Stress is dangerous.<eos> How's the weed working out?<eos> I haven't been smoking a lot.<eos> The first man who smoked marijuana was a Chinese emperor.<eos> He burned the plant because he was attracted to its smell.<eos> But when he inhaled the smoke, he saw a blue jay.<eos> And the bird told him to conquer his neighboring empires.<eos> And that's what he did.<eos> All right.<eos> With you until death, Don Pablo.
- Thank you.<eos> - Excuse me, Colonel...<eos> Guten tag.<eos> Join the DEA, see the world, right?<eos> The airport, anyways.<eos> Listen...<eos> I need you to prepare yourself for some blowback.<eos> It goes high up.<eos> And these people aren't gonna like it when I try to get myself out of it.<eos> If they come after you about what I've been doing, you protect yourself first.
This is a cowboy's knot.<eos> This is really good.<eos> Pablo Escobar.<eos> Reward 2,700,000 pesos.<eos> Call for free from any city at 9-800-10-600.<eos> In Bogotá, 222-50-12.<eos> In Medellín, 461-11-11.<eos> The kids would love to be here.<eos> I've been thinking...<eos> I could buy some land here next to you.
The laughs.<eos> I think the ambassador wants to see you.<eos> I guess word about this Miami Herald thing is spreading like a prairie fire.<eos> And bring your passport.<eos> I think you're going home, but... you didn't hear that from me.<eos> Tata?<eos> Tata, can you hear me?<eos> Pablo?<eos> It's me, my love.<eos> Finally, I can speak to you, my love.
You can survive prison.<eos> We both know that won't happen.<eos> Stop, stop, stop, stop! Shh!<eos> - Listen to me, Pablo.<eos> - They're talking.<eos> -You will always be Pablo Escobar.<eos> -Boss.<eos> You will always be that man that's admired and followed.<eos> My man.<eos> My love, there's a lot of journalists who want to speak with you.

Right now, Mikkei is set to take the fall.<eos> But I have a feeling that if you come clean, we can deal some serious damage to two major Corporations.<eos> Why would you want to do that?<eos> Because, right now, it's probably the only way to head off an inter galactic corporate war.<eos> Oh, yes. There's one on the way.<eos> And if it comes, those 15,000 deaths, they'll just be a drop in the bucket.<eos> Now, I can either get the truth from you, or I can wait...<eos> Who's that?<eos> The one you call Five.<eos> I know she's here with you.
Ms. Tessmacher!<eos> She cries more than Halle Berry at award shows.<eos> Well, if you hate her so much, why don't you fire her?<eos> Normally, you'd ax an assistant the second they brought you a latte one degree off.<eos> Oh, Ker-rah.<eos> I don't even know what normal is anymore.<eos> Ms. Grant, what's wrong?<eos> What could be wrong?<eos> I have followed every one of my passions, I've achieved everything I've ever wanted to achieve, and I'm at the very top of my game.<eos> The question is, Ker-rah, what the hell is wrong with you?
It's good to have you officially on the team.<eos> Oh, I was just wondering...<eos> And this is not a deal-breaker whatsoever, but I had a pretty sweet IRA over at Catco.<eos> Does that transfer over here?<eos> Or...<eos> Doesn't bother you that I got top credit on this one, does it?<eos> Not even a little bit?<eos> Honestly, I've never been more offended.<eos> Really, I'm flying home right now.<eos> No, I'm very proud just to be working beside you.
- What's in your hand?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Hey!<eos> A communication device.<eos> - She's a spy.<eos> - I'm not a spy.<eos> I'm a member of the Mikkei delegation.<eos> - Now let me go.<eos> - Is there a problem here?<eos> You looked upset, so I thought I'd check on you.
- Wait, not yet.<eos> Go to the Marauder, prep for launch.<eos> - Give me ten minutes.<eos> - Five.<eos> I think I might know where the bomb is.<eos> This is a great honor.<eos> Inside.<eos> This space station is in danger.<eos> I have no doubt.<eos> Who else is here with you?
Peter starts walking across the water, he's having a great time, waving to everyone.<eos> Except, again, this is Peter we're talking about.<eos> And what does he do?<eos> He looks down.<eos> What do you think happens next?<eos> That's right, Luis.<eos> He drops like a rock.<eos> Just like that.<eos> And then Jesus grabs his arm, tosses him back into the boat and he says,<eos> "What's wrong with you?
A little gristle for the gums.<eos> How's the boat, Henry?<eos> How's that?<eos> The boat... did you fix it up?<eos> He's talking about your boat, Henry.<eos> You're wasting your time.<eos> - He's basically a potato.<eos> - Kat!<eos> Should we get dessert?<eos> Katherine, what is wrong with you?
I got to go.<eos> What did I do?<eos> Cricket!<eos> Who are you?<eos> Look, you said you could accept me.<eos> - Blair...<eos> - Every time I see you, you seem to be filming something.<eos> You know what they say.<eos> The camera never lies.<eos> I feel like I could talk to you all night.
If you're lucky enough to find it, you should go for it, right?<eos> Right.<eos> Boo!<eos> Hey, hey, what's going on?<eos> Alex said there's a monster in these woods!<eos> Yeah, a flesh-eating ghoul with a taste for camper blood.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Whatever, Jessie. Come on.<eos> Bye, Alex.<eos> Hey, are you okay?
And why is that?<eos> Because bear traps aren't the only thing we should be worried about.<eos> Even if it wasn't Deb, I still saw someone in that mask.<eos> I didn't imagine it, and they could still be out there.<eos> You know, it seems like... you need something else to focus on.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, I was thinking, maybe I'd come here tonight, after lights out, and watch the Blood Moon.<eos> You want to join?<eos> You mean, do I want to have sex with you under the Blood Moon?
Yeah, I don't like "buddy," either.<eos> Hey.<eos> Good luck.<eos> I hope she shows.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Where's Jessie?<eos> She's with Sykes.<eos> Is she okay?<eos> -She's fine.<eos> What's wrong with you?
Guys.<eos> Deb needs us now.<eos> Where did you leave it, sweetheart? Do you remember?<eos> - - What happened?<eos> She lost her inhaler.<eos> She can't breathe if we don't get it back.<eos> Or someone else will die.<eos> Hey, Francie, do you think you might have left it where we stopped earlier? - Yeah?<eos> - I'll go get it.<eos> - I'll go with you.
Hey.<eos> Well, Francie's breathing normally again.<eos> She's gonna be okay.<eos> Thanks to you.<eos> Now, everybody, get to bed.<eos> It's been a long night... for all of us.<eos> Guess that's my cue, too, right?<eos> So you're gonna go meet him?<eos> Got to give it a shot.<eos> I'm proud of you.
You think the enemy feels the same?<eos> I don't really give a shit what the enemy thinks.<eos> Well, I do.<eos> In fact, that's almost all I think about, and now they know that the great Bob the Nailer is here, at this forward operating base.<eos> You know how much your bounty's up to?<eos> Last I heard, 600,000.<eos> You keep getting spotted on your infil, pretty soon the Navy chaplain's gonna be talking to Julie.<eos> We weren't spotted, Captain.<eos> Those guys weren't on patrol, Bob Lee.<eos> They were coming right after you.
He told me his name was Simms, that he was CIA.<eos> Who am I supposed to go to if the CIA wants to kill me?<eos> We don't know he's CIA.<eos> He could be a mercenary working for anybody.<eos> Shit.<eos> They'll know you're alive now.<eos> They're gonna comafter u.<eos> Yeah, they'll take another shot at you too.<eos> I can't exactly disappear and go on the run like you.<eos> No, they'd find you, which is why I've been watching out for you since I faked my death.
Make your own future.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's good, Jiya?<eos> You sure you can trust that book?<eos> Hold up!<eos> I need to see some ID.<eos> Rufus.<eos> Hey, Anthony.<eos> Is it or is it not Taco Tuesday, and your turn to pick up said tacos?<eos> Um, ask Jiya to go with you.
Naw, that's news to me.<eos> I was thinking about running down some of the guys - from his old operation.<eos> - Why?<eos> This was your idea.<eos> Just looking for a little closure of my own.<eos> And you want from me...<eos> You want names.<eos> First thing's first.<eos> Frank, this is Chester, he's your hookup.<eos> This is Rainman, he'll have eyes on you in the apartment.
Raim?<eos> WQ2YV.<eos> WQ2YV, come in!<eos> Dad, are you there?<eos> I'm a cop?<eos> If I'm a cop, what does that make you, huh?<eos> - Are you really that dumb?<eos> - Shut up!<eos> Okay, okay, look, if I was a cop, if I was, you think it's gonna end like this with you just shooting me right here?<eos> You don't think that Little Jay's gonna come at you? Huh?
I just wrote what I saw.<eos> Well, it's the most sensual piece of writing I've ever come across.<eos> And I've come across a lot of sensual writing.<eos> You forget a lot, right, that you're our principal?<eos> Hey there.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> Hey!<eos> - You want the scoop?<eos> - Not really.<eos> You've got a big story right in front of you, Steve.
Dad, we had a good time.<eos> I saw a Polynesian!<eos> No!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> This is unacceptable!<eos> The only reason I brought you to life was to teach Hayley history, but you're useless!<eos> Don't yell at him, Dad.<eos> I-I don't know how to get this through your head, but I don't care about history.<eos> And in case you're wondering, this is the first President's Day I have ever enjoyed.<eos> You know, in fact, I would rather spend any day with him than with you.
♪ So I put my hands up ♪<eos> ♪ They're playin' my song ♪<eos> ♪ The butterflies fly away ♪<eos> ♪ I'm nodding' my head like yeah ♪<eos> Baby girl!<eos> You're okay!<eos> I think my arm is broken in sev...<eos> I was wrong.<eos> These President's Day trips were never about history.<eos> They were about spending time with you, driving all over the map.
Damn, son, you're a natural!<eos> Here, I found us some nachos.<eos> I love the way the filth from the finger holes mixes with the synthetic cheese.<eos> And blasting all those pins must have made you thirsty, too.<eos> What?<eos> Are you... really?<eos> Nothing wrong with a father sharing a cold one with his boy.<eos> These darn glasses seem to be all fogged up.<eos> 'Cause I'm not seeing a thing.<eos> Hanging out with you has been the most awesome time ever, Dad.
You... were the one who stabbed me? !<eos> Where's your proof?<eos> Damn it!<eos> Why would you do this? !<eos> The edge pieces have the most icing.<eos> No!<eos> Stabbing me!<eos> I don't know!<eos> We had such a good thing going for a while, and... and then I started to lose you.<eos> And... and when I heard I'd never be able to bowl with you again, I... I...
Actually, it is my business, Blair.<eos> - I'm camp director. And... - And what?<eos> I mean, all you've done is shut down camp for a day.<eos> No activities, just letting people sit around and be sad.<eos> At least I'm doing something.<eos> I am your boss. You have to listen to me.<eos> No. What, do you want to fire me?<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> - Blair.<eos> Go back to your cabin... and I'll speak with you in the morning.
Stop!<eos> - Stop!<eos> - No!<eos> Cricket!<eos> Come back, come back!<eos> Somebody pushed me!<eos> Who pushed you? Cricket, what happened?<eos> ! Who pushed you?<eos> ! Cricket, where are you?<eos> Are you okay?
Not again.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, wake up.<eos> What... what did you...<eos> Deb, I need this.<eos> Stay with me, please.<eos> Don't go.<eos> I have to.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll come with you.
The second he sees anyone try to take her...<eos> Boom... we swoop in.<eos> Amy...<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> Hear what?<eos> Just do me a favor... stay away from Golden Grove today.<eos> Golden Grove?<eos> According to this map, that's where the ritual's gonna take place.<eos> Isn't that where your dad was killed?<eos> I'll come with you.
Does he know you did time for possession?<eos> Calm down, baby.<eos> This one's different.<eos> They always are.<eos> I wish you told me Half the building was coming over tonight.<eos> Do you not remember I have My North-Western interview in two days?<eos> Of course I remember, baby.<eos> I just...<eos> I wasn't thinking, I guess.<eos> I'm proud of you.
Oh, baby, you got to switch seats with me.<eos> - What? - I have two priors!<eos> They're gonna throw the book at me!<eos> But if I get arrested, Northwestern will...<eos> North-Western? !<eos> North-Western?<eos> I am your mother.<eos> Do you want to see me go to prison?<eos> Now come on.<eos> I spent my whole life looking out for you.
I told you to keep Ralphie in his cage.<eos> It's mean to keep him in a cage, mom.<eos> He wants to be free.<eos> He's mine.<eos> Get your hands off of him.<eos> If you ever touch Ralphie again...<eos> - Dad! He's your brother's pet.<eos> But he's trapped!<eos> Amy. Why don't you ever listen?<eos> What's wrong with you?
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Amy, don't.<eos> Amy!<eos> We will fight the demon the way we have always fought darkness at this lake...<eos> With light.<eos> Malphas.<eos> You want an innocent?<eos> Take me.<eos> I won't fight you.
Take me.<eos> I won't fight you.<eos> Let me be your vessel.<eos> And let Amy go.<eos> They're all gonna die.<eos> And it's all because of you.<eos> Time to face your demons, kid.<eos> Jessie, don't do it.<eos> I know what it is to have the light snuffed out inside of you, to be told the light in your heart is weakness.<eos> I won't let that happen to you.
I mean, I thought this year I'd meet a guy that I actually clicked with, you know?<eos> Like someone like... Like me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I wish I was as romantic as you. Yeah, well, usually romantics end up alone.<eos> Since when are you alone?<eos> Are we still road tripping after camp?<eos> Seattle?<eos> Bowie?<eos> I wouldn't miss it.<eos> It's gonna be me and you forever, isn't it?
He had this when you guys went...<eos> Well, when Holyoke brought you back to his cabin.<eos> The piano might have been tainted now...<eos> But it wasn't then. Happy accident.<eos> Nothing happens by accident.<eos> Look.<eos> You saved all of us.<eos> We did it together.<eos> Garrett, come on.<eos> I can't come with you.
Crap.<eos> You think DeLuca's gonna say anything?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yeah, he will.<eos> Or he won't.<eos> We can't control it.<eos> All we can do is just go on, live our lives, be there for our patients and our friends, and go to dinner parties.<eos> I'm not going to a party.<eos> You have to go because I have to go.<eos> And if I can go to court for you, you can go to a dinner party for me.
I'm tagging her in.<eos> That kind of defeats the point of all of this.<eos> I didn't agree to all of this.<eos> No, tag me in. It's fine.<eos> You're starting a thing here.<eos> No, it's okay. All good.<eos> And you're not even giving it a chance.<eos> Guys, I'll tag myself in.<eos> You obviously need to talk about this.<eos> And I am right behind you.
You're still crying?<eos> Of course I'm still crying.<eos> April, come on, okay?<eos> I'm gonna bring her by every single day at the hospital.<eos> We already talked about it.<eos> As soon as you get home, we'll fly your mom back out, get her to stay out here for a couple months.<eos> My mom already came for as long as she could, okay?<eos> I can't ask her to come back out.<eos> She's... She's got work.<eos> Well, get a baby nurse who can stay and live with you, then.
The clinic is supplied for crap.<eos> You didn't pick up my calls or answer my texts.<eos> Arizona...<eos> I was worried about you.<eos> No, you were mad at me.<eos> Damn right I was mad. I'm still mad.<eos> You beat up my roommate.<eos> So, that's why you're mad?<eos> Some guy you barely know who pays you rent got beat up?<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
The cobbler's children always go barefoot.<eos> What the hell is all this?<eos> This is new revenue stream...<eos> Fake passports.<eos> Very reliable and less work than tittie van.<eos> I like driving the tittie van.<eos> You will like it less in winter.<eos> Your windows don't close.<eos> All right, so let me get this straight.<eos> You... you... you steal my van, which I love, which I've owned way before I met you, and you sell it and you spend my money on all of this?
Why was the broom late for the meeting?<eos> It overswept.<eos> Stay out!<eos> You commie cunt.<eos> Frank!<eos> It's me, baby.<eos> Great.<eos> I fucked up.<eos> I know I fucked up.<eos> I fucked up bad, but I-I'm gonna make it up to you and the kids.
So, Debbie showed me a photo of Carl in his military uniform.<eos> So sharp.<eos> And Liam at Hopkins Academy?<eos> And Debbie's a mom!<eos> Must've done something right.<eos> And you did great things too, Fiona.<eos> Taking care of all the kids.<eos> You are amazing.<eos> You did such a better job than I could've.<eos> I'm proud of you.
This is not better option.<eos> And now there's no deed.<eos> This is only a copy.<eos> I filed paperwork with county clerk and IRS.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Big Poppa...<eos> Don't call me that.<eos> It's creepy now.<eos> Nothing has to change.<eos> I still love V. I still fuck you.
On the table right there.<eos> Wait, why?<eos> Lighter fluid? Downstairs.<eos> Hey.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Barely functioning.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Nothing.<eos> What's with you?
So what now?<eos> Laying low with my cellmate Damon.<eos> Mexican banger hit man motherfucker.<eos> Cops come talking to you?<eos> Think I'd snitch?<eos> Look, I'm, um...<eos> I'm getting some new IDs, some cash, and heading to Mexico.<eos> Wow.<eos> You should come.<eos> Come with you to Mexico?
Probably.<eos> Where's this coming from?<eos> Things have been weird between me and Trev since Mickey got out.<eos> You mean since Mickey busted out of prison and has got half the Chicago Police Department circling the South Side looking for him?<eos> Can't get him out of my head.<eos> I'm just trying to stop myself from doing something I shouldn't.<eos> You turned your life around.<eos> Mickey would set a match to it.<eos> You've done really great without him.<eos> And I'm really fucking proud of you.
I took a job away from my single-mother baby sister.<eos> We're assholes.<eos> Completely.<eos> I know it makes me wack, but I was really in love with her, Fi.<eos> Now my heart is broken and I feel like a fool.<eos> She didn't deserve you.<eos> You still ended up in a great relationship.<eos> You got Kev.<eos> So you won.<eos> It sucked not being able to talk to you.
- Go away.<eos> You already forgave me for everything else.<eos> What's one more?<eos> Is it broken?<eos> No.<eos> You didn't hear my vows yet.<eos> I stand here today because my life is infinitely better with you, than without.<eos> You remember the vows from our first wedding?<eos> I vow to love who you are and who you become.<eos> I vow to build a family and to create a loving home with you filled with laughter and joy.
That's so perfect!<eos> You stupid.<eos> You deserve to die.<eos> Lee, what would make you think Flora's here?<eos> I've been searching everywhere for two weeks.<eos> This is the last place I want to be.<eos> But I saw Priscilla come in here.<eos> She took Flora from me before.<eos> I found that on the floor. Lee!<eos> What happened to you after the Lana Winters thing? Why the would I tell you?
Leave all your shit<eos> - and get out now.<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> Ch-Chasers don't run.<eos> Follow them!<eos> Priscilla?<eos> She's there!<eos> Straight ahead.<eos> Did you see her?<eos> She was right in front of you.
That's what it's like to be a parent.<eos> You picture how you want to be and it's so wonderful and flawless but you can't ever live up to that picture you imagined.<eos> You killed Daddy. With a rock.<eos> I saw you.<eos> He was gonna take you away from me.<eos> A girl needs her mother.<eos> Your daddy never understood that.<eos> I am so sorry for the things I've done, but I am your champion, Flora.<eos> I don't care what the world thinks about me.<eos> To tell you the truth, the only damn thing I have to live for is to look after you.
Oh, because Alex is here, and we want to see what Alex is up to.<eos> Does Alex have something he'd like to share with the group?<eos> AA pamphlets?<eos> They're for this patient, this college kid.<eos> She's a mess.<eos> Literature is not gonna do it.<eos> When you're addicted to something and you want it so badly, a piece of paper is...<eos> It's not gonna make her stay away.<eos> What would make you stay away?<eos> Say if you were a bartender and an alcoholic and there's alcohol in front of you right under your nose all the time.
You are okay?<eos> Alessandra?<eos> Alessandra?<eos> Alessandra?<eos> - Buon giorno.<eos> - Buon giorno.<eos> Hey, Alessandra-- Hai Lai--<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Have you seen Alessandra?<eos> Uh, no, I thought that she was coming with you.
Imagine if you were a runner-up. That'd be awful.<eos> - This looks like a nice place. - Yes. It's beautiful.<eos> Let me introduce you to Wet Stones Creek.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> I used to come here with my grandfather.<eos> He loved watching the birds catch fish.<eos> Want to come in the water?<eos> I'm not sure about these swim shorts, after all.<eos> You can swim naked. We're all alone.<eos> If I join you, it won't be for swimming purposes only.
- That's probably why.<eos> - You're sure now?<eos> Now it's your job to convince me.<eos> You'll have the referral tomorrow, first thing in the morning.<eos> Tell me...<eos> What's the population of Bergerane?<eos> 42,000, according to the last census.<eos> Guillaume Vauban alone against 42,000 prosecutors.<eos> Good luck.<eos> And with you as their chief...
If you knew how many magistrates, politicians - male and female - unionists and CEOs got caught in that kind of out-takes game.<eos> I won't tolerate Guillaume being tried at the criminal court for a murder he didn't commit.<eos> I should have told you the day it happened because you, too, were there.<eos> You were sleeping. You didn't see anything.<eos> She was there, with her shirt in her hand, trying to soak it in the water.<eos> Her hair was all over her face, she had blood running down her arm and her leg.<eos> There was blood everywhere, she was crying...<eos> She was too close to the edge.<eos> She slipped and she fell down, head first. The rock gashed her head.<eos> I swear, I wanted to get in the water and save her, but instead, I stayed there, next to you, paralyzed, petrified, unable to do anything whatsoever.
I knew it.<eos> Oh, my name is Dirk Gently. I'm a detective,<eos> I live here now, and... Ooh. ... I'll be sleeping here tonight.<eos> You're a terrible assistant.<eos> "Project Icarus" is leaving the building.<eos> What about the other guy?<eos> I don't know yet.<eos> What? What?<eos> It's hard to hear you through the comm in my ear.<eos> I'm not talking to you through the comm.
Do you have any friends who can come by and just help you with this, cleaning up, or...<eos> It's hard to keep friends when you can't go outside without worrying a gust of wind will knock you down.<eos> I barely get out of the house anymore.<eos> God.<eos> Why don't you move back in with Mom and Dad?<eos> - May be they can help you.<eos> - You know that they're broke, Todd.<eos> I would just be a burden on them.<eos> I'm a burden on everyone.<eos> What's wrong with you, exactly?
Back off!<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, you pay for her medication?<eos> I did.<eos> What's changed?<eos> That was my last $300.<eos> I now literally have no money.<eos> None.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You lost your job, you've got that nut Dorian chasing you around, why give her all of your money?
Every time I see her, she looks at me, and thinks...<eos> She thinks maybe she can get better, too.<eos> Well, isn't there a chance she will, though?<eos> If you did?<eos> Let's... Can we just be quiet for the drive?<eos> Probably should've seen this one coming.<eos> Like the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs.<eos> There's no way I could have known what...<eos> I'm not...<eos> I'm coming to get you, Lydia.

Ow! Stupid traitor bed!<eos> Whoo! I'm sick of the games!<eos> No chess, no checkers, no Monopoly!<eos> What is this?<eos> What is happening?<eos> The rowdy 3!<eos> Let's go!<eos> There are four of them.<eos> I'm wildly aware.<eos> They're after you, right?
Shit, Alpha is in danger.<eos> We're live.<eos> Lock and load.<eos> Okay.<eos> Lockers.<eos> No.<eos> Everything I own...<eos> No...<eos> Why?<eos> What did they do to you?
Just another crazy... situation.<eos> Farah... the night you were kidnapped, it was me behind the door you were knocking on.<eos> I-I didn't let you in, and...<eos> I know that, obviously.<eos> You knew?<eos> It's not like I forgot which door I knocked on, Todd.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> I had my weapon drawn.<eos> Well, right, but...<eos> When I met you that first night, you... you saved my life.
Okay. Okay.<eos> Security will meet you on the ground in Belize.<eos> You cannot call me when you land.<eos> From there, you'll be on your own.<eos> You can access your father's offshore accounts.<eos> Everything's...<eos> I don't understand why I have to leave the country.<eos> It's just for now.<eos> We... We don't know how many of them are still out there.<eos> They could still be looking for you.
They're coming!<eos> It's really bad!<eos> What?<eos> What's happening?<eos> Who's coming?<eos> Todd, listen to me.<eos> You have to listen.<eos> Wait.<eos> Stay where you are.<eos> I'll find you.
Previously on<eos> "Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency"...<eos> What did they do to you?
I don't know anything about a machine.<eos> Uh, yes, what did they say, exactly?<eos> That Lydia's... gone.<eos> I... I need to go back to the Spring Estate.<eos> Are you sure that's...<eos> All my things are there.<eos> My clothes, my guns.<eos> No, no. No more guns!<eos> You look good.<eos> We'll go with you.
Put some clothes on.<eos> You knew this was going to happen.<eos> Well, not this, but something like this, sure.<eos> It's real, isn't it?<eos> It's all real.<eos> You really are who you say you are.<eos> Some kind of... killer angel.<eos> Angel?<eos> I really am what I say I am.<eos> I'm with you for a reason.
I don't want the things that Lux wanted anymore.<eos> I am taking back control!<eos> Sammy.<eos> Do you remember when we were together on that yacht off the coast of Portugal?<eos> Do you remember?<eos> Sammy... do you remember when you still loved me?<eos> Before I was all this.<eos> Do you remember what I told you?<eos> "When I die... you die." Yes.<eos> Lux... what happened to you?
There is something... seriously wrong.<eos> Following Patrick Spring's map, Todd and I got into some bad trouble underground<eos> A treasure map.<eos> We leave first thing in the morning.<eos> Boys.<eos> You'll get them, sir.<eos> All of them.<eos> Everything is connected.<eos> Rapunzel, get over here!<eos> I'm sorry I did this to you.
It'll be all right.<eos> We've got this absolutely under control.<eos> Honestly, I'm just relieved we got through the drive without anyone or anything trying to kill us.<eos> He knows something.<eos> Of course he knows something... he's Patrick Spring's lawyer.<eos> Well, you'd think he'd want to tell us if it meant finding Lydia.<eos> I'm not saying he knows where Lydia is, but he certainly knows who Patrick Spring's enemies were.<eos> So, what now?<eos> We follow up on Rimmer.<eos> This kind of stuff happens to you all the time, - doesn't it? - Hmm?
You're Goddamn right.<eos> He was acting awfully funny.<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> Something's very wrong.<eos> We're gonna go there right now.<eos> But is it the right thing to do?<eos> For Lydia.<eos> If she's even still alive.<eos> What kind of thing is that to say?<eos> What's wrong with you?
This isn't happening.<eos> I'm sorry, Todd, but this is not... happening.<eos> - Wait...<eos> - Not... happening. No...<eos> Amanda...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Spot checks.<eos> Whoever was following you could be watching us now.<eos> "Spot checks." Fantastic.<eos> I think of you and me as Module "B" of the detective agency.
Goodnight!<eos> Take that!<eos> I got him!<eos> Amanda, thank God.<eos> Don't touch me!<eos> Amanda...<eos> No.<eos> You brought me here to keep me safe?<eos> Here?<eos> Into this. With you.
Sexy Ping-Pong.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Cool.<eos> There he is.<eos> Mr. Leaving Las Vegas, but with an inspirational ending.<eos> Kev, don't.<eos> I get it.<eos> You want to downplay your courage.<eos> I understand.<eos> I'm just so proud of you, man.
He has a friend named Throttle.<eos> It's a very colorful group of people.<eos> I-I'm not supposed to say names, but I think nicknames are okay, but just don't tell any of your biker friends...<eos> Just cover our bases.<eos> But anyway, Guardrail said some people in my life would take it harder than others.<eos> It's... it's all right, Josh.<eos> No one caused this.<eos> It's me.<eos> And I'm working on it.<eos> Well, I'm proud of you.
It's... it's all right, Josh.<eos> No one caused this.<eos> It's me.<eos> And I'm working on it.<eos> Well, I'm proud of you.<eos> Cheers, Greg.<eos> Don't cheers an alcoholic, dumb-ass.<eos> It's a light beer, idiot-ass.<eos> White Josh is right.<eos> I-I don't think we should be drinking around you.

Previously on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...<eos> - HEATHER: So, you and V are good now.
I want to be gal pals with Rebecca.<eos> She makes me think women can have it all.<eos> Hey, Maya, has anyone ever told you that your voice sounds like a mouse with throat cancer (high-pitched): talking into a little, tiny mouse voice box?<eos> Do you get that a lot?<eos> What?<eos> No. I-I've never heard that before, but I-I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bother you,<eos> I'm just really sad that I'm not at Rebecca's house for the fun party. Sweetheart, listen to me, you can't force a friendship.<eos> Everyone knows that.<eos> But what if you and I team up and we find a way into that party?<eos> Me? Team up with you?
- Hailey's friend and my friend.<eos> - Oh, hey.<eos> - Nice get up.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'm mildly obsessed with a turn of the century composer.<eos> This is how she dresses.<eos> I used to dress up as Lord Byron and smoke opium in college.<eos> - No shit.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I was you before you were you, Dee Dee.
Yeah.<eos> Stage three.<eos> How long?<eos> Six months to a year.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why do you think he wanted you to come home?<eos> He...?<eos> He what?<eos> Yeah, he wanted you to come home so he can spend time with you, Laurel.
Stop.<eos> - Okay...<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Please let me go.<eos> - You can't do this.<eos> - Why not?<eos> He's not gonna talk to us unless we threaten him.<eos> - It's torture, Gustav.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's not like what happened with you.
Looks like we hit a dead end.<eos> There's no way out.<eos> Can't we just do the future, door-find-y thingy, and use the prophecy glass?<eos> What was prophecy glass?<eos> It's what the lenses in the goggles have become once...<eos> Nina?<eos> Why didn't you ask what prophecy glass is?<eos> Because you called it that already.<eos> No, I didn't. Not in front of you.<eos> None of us ever used that phrase in front of you, but you did.
They're equipped with an emergency location transmitter.<eos> If we can locate this ELT, that's our best chance for getting saved.<eos> I know this because I spent 10 years in the British Special Forces.<eos> Wow!<eos> He already said that.<eos> What was that like?<eos> What sort of things did...<eos> Now, we know some of the wreckage landed in the jungle.<eos> That's why tomorrow, I'm going on a hike.<eos> Owen and I are gonna go with you.
Mike, every two minutes someone is sexually assaulted in our country.<eos> Do you know how often the perpetrator is punished?<eos> - Less than one percent. - Thanks.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yes.<eos> And do you know why?<eos> Because it's because of this exact conversation, because we don't believe our victims. We make them feel like they asked for it.<eos> Okay. I'm just trying to have a dialogue, but if you're just gonna recite a Planned Parenthood pamphlet at me...<eos> My God.<eos> What's the point to it? I can't believe I ever slept with you.
It was impressive.<eos> I was just in the back somewhere drowning.<eos> Sure. Yeah. I...<eos> You don't remember me.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I've been following your career. Pretty impressive stuff.<eos> Well, it hasn't exactly worked out that well for me.<eos> Shit happens.<eos> Hey, look.<eos> I'm, gonna keep an eye out for you, all right?
- Who told you I was here? - Nina. I couldn't believe it.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - I almost thought that she<eos> - was joking.<eos> - You said you were the wife?<eos> - She's my ex. - Have the police arrived yet?<eos> - Police?<eos> - They really<eos> - should have been here by now.<eos> - Why? - Who did this to you?
What... what is she talking about?<eos> - Did I get stabbed?<eos> - Why doesn't he know that?<eos> I'm-I'm very sorry, Mr. Solloway.<eos> You were attacked by someone with a knife.<eos> You bled profusely.<eos> They took you to surgery where Dr. Quittner closed the artery off. - Jesus.<eos> - You were very lucky.<eos> The blade missed your airway, and your jugular vein, and just nicked your artery.<eos> - Who did this to you?
Six months.<eos> No explanation. No warning.<eos> I have a lot to explain, and I will.<eos> I just need to see Joanie.<eos> No.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> I'm better now, and I'm back, and I'm not gonna leave her again.<eos> That's what you got. One, two times a week.<eos> I've tried to be patient with you, and then you just fucking disappear.<eos> There's something deeply wrong with you.
Oh, the bullets.<eos> No.<eos> Yep.<eos> Damn it, damn it!<eos> You think I was gonna keep a loaded gun next to my dick and balls?<eos> Yeah, balls!<eos> Whatever.<eos> You guys had crappy stuff anyway.<eos> What's up, Jess?<eos> What are we gonna do about you?
Oh! God damn it!<eos> Sure it was Tucci.<eos> He's been in so many goddamn things.<eos> All the faces look the same.<eos> I got it!<eos> I got it.<eos> I know the name!<eos> Rupert Everett!<eos> We already said Rupert Everett, Pablo!<eos> What's wrong with you?
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm...<eos> You know I'm trying to put that behind me.<eos> Clearly, the Count didn't get the memo.<eos> Maybe that's the problem.<eos> You hired him.<eos> You fire him.<eos> Well, that's exactly what I'm going to do.<eos> The invitation says to meet him at the dirigible in an hour.<eos> - Well, we're coming with you.
It's...<eos> It's just, an occasion like this calls for a bottle to match, and, uh, I have just the one in the cellar, so... forgive me, miss.<eos> I know you think this was your fault, Mom.<eos> That's not it, Henry.<eos> I stood up in Granny's and told everyone from the Land of Untold Stories not to be afraid.<eos> They've only been here one day.<eos> I can't let the first story play out like this, not when I'm the one who started it all.<eos> Mom.<eos> He poisoned her with the poison I gave him.<eos> Mom, are you okay?
It's that scent.<eos> At the same time, she's pressing you to... share your loss.<eos> Outside my window when I was little, there was a flowering tree.<eos> Ceanothus... wild lilac.<eos> I didn't know the name then.<eos> I just knew that you could smell it even through a locked window.<eos> I know that to survive this long, you've had to keep yourself private.<eos> And by letting me in, even as far as you have, can make you feel violated all over again.<eos> I know that even before you went to school, you were taught about violence and cruelty.<eos> That the people who were supposed to love, care for, and protect you instead violated you beyond measure.
We're gonna get it off.<eos> Hold still.<eos> Okay.<eos> Move your head out of the way.<eos> - Hold him still. - [gags]<eos> All right.<eos> - Okay? - [coughs]<eos> Okay.<eos> [gasps] Thank God. [breathing heavily]<eos> [Walt] Do you know who did this to you?
I heard a shot.<eos> A minute later, I felt something sharp in my shoulder.<eos> You didn't see who taped you to that tree?<eos> I was taped to a tree?<eos> Jesus.<eos> Did Dan see anybody?<eos> Wait.<eos> Where is Dan?<eos> Dan's missing.<eos> We found this nailed to the tree above you.
Someone stabbed me.<eos> Well, who?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> I never saw anyone.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Do the police have any leads?<eos> Not that I know of.<eos> Jesus, Noah. I'm so sorry.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Are you sure you're okay?
Do the police have any leads?<eos> Not that I know of.<eos> Jesus, Noah. I'm so sorry.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Are you sure you're okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> I'm glad you're here.<eos> And I... I want to talk about everything.<eos> But you have to know I'm in such a precarious position.<eos> Joanie's lawyer basically told me that if I have anything to do with you, it will ruin my case.
I'm sorry.<eos> It's nice to see me just a little bit, though, right?<eos> Night.<eos> Hey.<eos> So, I... I have an idea.<eos> Why don't we go to Block Island for the day?<eos> - Well, you can't be seen with me here, so let's go somewhere else.<eos> What... are you insane?<eos> That's the million-dollar question.<eos> No, I... I'm not having eggs with you. I'm not taking a stroll with you.
What do you mean?<eos> I mean are you gonna hang out in Montauk for the rest of your life hoping that Cole will stop being such a giant dick?<eos> Don't talk about him like that.<eos> Okay, but he's an asshole.<eos> I'm serious. Stop.<eos> I mean, who takes a child away from their own mother?<eos> Look, he didn't take her...<eos> Nevermind. Come on.<eos> Say it.<eos> No, there's no point talking to you.
Fuck, can I open yet? Yes.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> This is nice.<eos> It is nice. You're right.<eos> Cheers.<eos> God.<eos> What if I moved to Montauk?<eos> Why?<eos> To be with you.
No wonder you're so intense.<eos> You're not going to lose me, Niska.<eos> You've got me.<eos> I'm going to go to Berlin.<eos> You do what you have to do, then you come home to me, OK?<eos> I may not come home.<eos> I never cared what happened to me before I met you.<eos> Then make sure you do come home.<eos> Three minutes to go.<eos> I'm not taking any chances with you.
I never cared what happened to me before I met you.<eos> Then make sure you do come home.<eos> Three minutes to go.<eos> I'm not taking any chances with you.<eos> - Just stay here.<eos> - This is too far from the house.<eos> - If something goes wrong...<eos> - I'm leaving you the car.<eos> You can be there in 30 seconds.<eos> Five minutes, then I'm coming after you.
I have Molly Ryan's phone.<eos> Like hell you do.<eos> Any idiot can spoof a cell number.<eos> Can any idiot do this?<eos> Handsome friends you have.<eos> Who the hell is this?<eos> I want £30,000 via Bitcoin or this photo gets lobbed to the FBI, the Scotland Yard, and Interpol... for starters.<eos> You have no idea the minefield you're stepping in.<eos> These men take their privacy very seriously, and when they come for you, and I promise you they will, they will inflict levels of pain that you can't even begin to imagine.<eos> Nice try but we both know you won't say a word... or they'll come for you first, right?
How are you feeling?<eos> How's your... heart?<eos> Weird, but OK.<eos> I keep getting really short of breath, but I'm adjusting to it.<eos> It's amazing what the body can get used to.<eos> I do not understand these signs.<eos> Come on, let's dance.<eos> For tonight, we might die.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> OK, seriously, what is wrong with you?
Wow.<eos> That's how you do a prom.<eos> I'm dressed really nice...<eos> All right?<eos> And we're changing the tune, now.<eos> We've got some nice ones coming your way...<eos> - That was such a good one!<eos> - You look so good.<eos> - I'm going to go to the toilet.<eos> - I'll come with you.
But it didn't.<eos> It left me with the rest of my stupid life, didn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it did.<eos> You're still not going to make me talk about it, are you?<eos> Lift back to your house?<eos> Is it a physical thing, son?<eos> Because we can check with the doctor.<eos> Dad.<eos> Can I talk to you about something?
And it didn't.<eos> I hated you for leaving.<eos> Everything was perfect and we were all so happy, and then you just left.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry, Daddy, I just...<eos> Please...<eos> Puddle.<eos> Come to your daddy.<eos> Let him listen to your pain.<eos> Let him tell you how he'll still watch over you.
Previously on Z Nation.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - To start a new world.<eos> - You're with me now.<eos> - I'll never be with you.
Nice to meet you.<eos> I'll tell your father you say hello.<eos> Where's my father?<eos> You know I won't say.<eos> Well, you might as well tell me, if you're gonna kill me.<eos> I suggest you die remembering him as he was.<eos> It's better that way.<eos> Unless you'd care to join him.<eos> Cadmus welcomes any bright minds willing to help our cause.<eos> My father would never collaborate with you.
What it could be, if they were no more.<eos> That's what I'm trying to do for the world.<eos> And you could help me.<eos> I've killed a Kryptonian before.<eos> I stabbed Astra of the House of El with a sword made of kryptonite.<eos> I've done what you want to do.<eos> What you can't do.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> Good.<eos> Because I want you to know what I'm capable of when I tell you that when I find my father, I'm coming for you.
Yes.<eos> Yes, Mr. White.<eos> Yes, I'm back.<eos> No, sir, I won't ever be gone that long again.<eos> Oh, gosh no, Mr. White. I...<eos> I would never imply that you would miss me.<eos> I'll have that article for you in a jiffy.<eos> A jiffy is a unit of measurement, sir.<eos> I know what it's like to be a stranger on this planet.<eos> So when you wake up, I'll be here for you.
- Nothing.<eos> No signal.<eos> - Me neither.<eos> - Who would you call, anyway?<eos> - I've got... friends.<eos> Besides us?<eos> Why are you being so mean, Ram?<eos> And, anyway, we're enough.<eos> We're enough for me.<eos> What is with you today?
It's the only way out he knows.<eos> He wants us to confess each other to death?<eos> You said earlier that maybe we're getting his anger.<eos> I agree.<eos> Can't you feel it?<eos> I'm doing everything I can not to yell at you guys right now.<eos> I-I don't feel angry, though.<eos> I feel hugely stressed about being trapped in a confined space we can't leave, but I'm not especially angry.<eos> That's true, isn't it?<eos> Why are you different?
Man, it is creepy as shit out here.<eos> Stop following me, Jerry!<eos> - God damn it! - Whoa!<eos> Why are you screaming at me, huh?<eos> ! After everything I gave to you.<eos> - Put your shirt down!<eos> - No, look at it. You're not real.<eos> You were just a dead body, and I was starving, so I hallucinated a conversation.<eos> That's it!<eos> But you're not starving now, so then... why am I still standing here talking to you?
That's it!<eos> But you're not starving now, so then... why am I still standing here talking to you?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Pack, that means you've gone crazy.<eos> Oh, no, Pack.<eos> You're nuts. No.<eos> Stop doing that voice.<eos> I'm not crazy.<eos> I'm very chill.<eos> Buddy, you chowed down on a dead dude, and now he's standing here, talking to you.
It's okay.<eos> Yeah, you don't have to consider it, okay?<eos> Because right now, I'm banishing myself and Danny because we would rather go live on the other side of this island and focus on what's important, which is getting home.<eos> Once you leave, you can never return.<eos> No, I understand what banishment is 'cause I just banished myself.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Danny, you ready to go?<eos> Daniel, you don't have to listen to this.<eos> He's... He's confused, I think.<eos> If I was you, I'd stay.
You know, I don't really want to cause any trouble, so I think I'm just gonna go.<eos> What?<eos> Where you gonna go?<eos> - Just gonna go back to my camp.<eos> - I thought they banished you, though.<eos> They did.<eos> They did.<eos> But it was a short banishment, so...<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, then, we'll go with you.
Where you gonna go?<eos> - Just gonna go back to my camp.<eos> - I thought they banished you, though.<eos> They did.<eos> They did.<eos> But it was a short banishment, so...<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, then, we'll go with you.<eos> - I don't even know how you could<eos> - Why can't we go with you?
Oh, is it ridiculous, Javier?<eos> Is it?<eos> From the backseat, Javier pipes up.<eos> Okay!<eos> You've never respected me.<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> You don't respect her!<eos> Eat a bag of dicks, Javier!<eos> That was too much and I know that.<eos> What is wrong with you?
Oh. Whoa.<eos> I didn't know you can propose to the same person so many times.<eos> The third time, I did it in skywriting, but she never looked up.<eos> You know, once, I proposed to him.<eos> Yeah. I said no.<eos> Why?<eos> I just wanted to make her work for it.<eos> Yeah, that's gonna cost you later.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Is she just with you because you're rich?
Previously on Supergirl...<eos> When Superman put Lex in jail, I vowed to take back my family's company.<eos> Make it a force for good.<eos> I am taking a leave of absence from Catco.<eos> I am the new Cat.<eos> Snapper Carr, meet Kara Danvers.<eos> Snapper will be running the investigative team at Catco Magazine.<eos> He landed on Earth last night in a Kryptonian pod.<eos> We don't know who he is.<eos> So when you wake up, I'll be here for you.
What's going on?<eos> Have you ever cried during sex?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who sent you here?<eos> Please answer the question.<eos> Have you ever cried during sex?<eos> I'm not answering these questions.<eos> If you don't answer, I'll be punished.<eos> They'll beat me.<eos> Who's doing that to you?
We're better than that.<eos> Weigh the pros and cons.<eos> Do what you need to do.<eos> As soon as the tabulations are over with, you'll know that telling anyone about this does neither one of us any good.<eos> In fact, you'll realize that the only thing to do in your position when it comes to me is nothing.<eos> Elliot!<eos> I believe in fate.<eos> There's a reason we met.<eos> There's something between us. I can see it.<eos> You're only seeing what's in front of you.
I know you guys were close.<eos> I'm sorry you had to lose him.<eos> He was involved in one of the most notorious hacker rings in the world.<eos> Things like this come with the territory.<eos> I invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and respectfully...<eos> You keep trying to invoke the Fifth Amendment, but there's this thing called the Patriot Act that a bunch of people signed into law.<eos> You know what that means?<eos> It means that you are not on some TV show.<eos> This isn't "Burn Notice."<eos> There are no blue skies for you out there.
We've lost three suspects.<eos> Dark Army's cleaning house.<eos> So that must mean something is about to go down.<eos> Our window is closing.<eos> Every lead we've been following up to this point has led to a dead end.<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna bring the ADIC in on this.<eos> Please, you're gonna let him try and flip her?<eos> She's gonna shut down.<eos> I'm right for this.<eos> Then I'm gonna go in with you.
Let me do it alone.<eos> I know her.<eos> I am her.<eos> And if we're doing this, we're doing this now.<eos> We have 6,332 agents working on just this case alone.<eos> It's the hardest case I've ever worked on and probably the hardest one I ever will.<eos> Swear to God, the only reason why I think I've gotten this far...<eos> Is because I have no life.<eos> It's the only thing I've been able to think about.<eos> Now I'm sitting here with you...
Did you bring it up, or did Katie bring it up?<eos> She did. Why?<eos> Katie!<eos> Oh, it's just, uh... weird they'd just air it again.<eos> Right? ?<eos> eah, yeah, I... yeah.<eos> Katie!<eos> Did she say what channel it was on?<eos> Um... no.<eos> I need to talk to you.
Did you or did you not give Joe Blake the film and let him escape?<eos> Not for the reasons you think.<eos> So it's coincidence you're sponsored by the most evil son of a bitch in the American Reich.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> John Smith.<eos> Do you know how many people he's had killed?<eos> No, I just met him.<eos> I don't know what he wants from me, either.<eos> Well, he didn't grant you asylum out of the kindness of his own heart.<eos> I'm guessing it has something to do with the Man you mentioned.
Catch up to her.<eos> On your mark... get set...<eos> You coming?<eos> Push!<eos> Good job!<eos> Let's go, recovery lap.<eos> You're champs!<eos> Goal 800m 1:54<eos> At your age, I would've beaten you... hands down!<eos> I'm proud of you, son.
You coming?<eos> Push!<eos> Good job!<eos> Let's go, recovery lap.<eos> You're champs!<eos> Goal 800m 1:54<eos> At your age, I would've beaten you... hands down!<eos> I'm proud of you, son.<eos> I know it's been rough since your mom passed.<eos> I'm so proud of you.
You're home schooled.<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> Free headshots.<eos> Right now, everybody!<eos> -Two for one.<eos> -Miranda, stop!<eos> You are making a scene!<eos> That's right, Miranda.<eos> I'm the one making the scene.<eos> Oh, I'd be happy to take a photo with you.
Is there a teacher who's supposed to be with you right now?<eos> No.<eos> Okay.<eos> Rehearsal's over.<eos> Go home.<eos> Now.<eos> Hey.<eos> What is this?<eos> Gary's keys.<eos> I'm coming with you.
I mean, sorry, not to be presumptuous, that there would be a next time, but, you know, if.<eos> Do you believe in intuition?<eos> Like... following your gut?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Definitely.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Something felt wrong today.<eos> I should've asked more questions.<eos> Are you going back to the station?<eos> [stammering] I could come with you.
Where is everybody?<eos> This way, kid.<eos> Let's go.<eos> We gotta find Doc and Addy and Warren.<eos> I already said thanks.<eos> We're going our own way now.<eos> We kept you alive all the way to California.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To start a new world.<eos> I'm not going anywhere with you, Murphy.
- Anyone know how to hot-wire a bus?<eos> - Do you really have to ask?<eos> Hey, wait!<eos> They're stealing the freaking bus.<eos> Oh guys, that's just great.<eos> Well there goes our ride.<eos> Come on, kid.<eos> Come on now.<eos> You've been bit. Murphy bit you!<eos> That's what's wrong with you.
Oh, you're having a lesson with--<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - The best.<eos> - He is.<eos> - He's the best.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Very lucky.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We're trying to...<eos> - Can I talk to you? - Can you-
I followed you because I thought you shouldn't have to face this alone.<eos> I don't need a knight in shining armour, Ram.<eos> I never have. April...<eos> - What happened?<eos> - There you are!<eos> I looked inside his mind too much.<eos> He knows I'm here.<eos> Who was that woman? And why does she know so much?<eos> It was worth it.<eos> - What is the matter with you?
It's now or never.<eos> We will be overwhelmed in moments.<eos> Try to still love me.<eos> - April.<eos> - Go!<eos> Get your dad to safety.<eos> You can't survive this.<eos> None of you can.<eos> Come on!<eos> I've come to take you back.
Ok.<eos> You seem like you've been feeling a bit better.<eos> I'm doing ok, Dad.<eos> Better.<eos> I made some new friends.<eos> You haven't told Mum about my leg, have you?<eos> You asked me not to.<eos> I just don't want her worrying, Dad.<eos> I don't like the thought of you facing anything alone.<eos> We'll always fight for you, and with you, if you let us.
No, no, no, no. No, Quills have whole litters of...<eos> Never mind.<eos> I will take you into battle.<eos> I'll take you to the very end of this world.<eos> If you harm her, you'll die.<eos> I'll make sure of it.<eos> She has Shadow Kin running through her veins.<eos> I'll only kill her if you refuse my offer.<eos> If this is another referendum...!<eos> You want me to come back with you?
10 minutes.<eos> Yeah, construction.<eos> Mmm. Hazelnut.<eos> â Nice, right?<eos> âDelicious.<eos> Not a lane!<eos> Not a lane!<eos> Not a lane!<eos> Hey!<eos> Whoa! What's the matter with you?
Everybody stand!<eos> Oh, God.<eos> He can't stand.<eos> The ovation is insensitive!<eos> Everybody down.<eos> Sorry.<eos> We're just excited.<eos> We haven't had a student before who's who has who is taller sitting down than any of us are standing up.<eos> We're done with the clapping!<eos> Your classmates have something they want to share with you.
But you'll have to bring Germaine back; we're not set up<eos> - for that right now.<eos> - I can do that.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll arrange a time.<eos> All right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What, Laurel?<eos> Laurel, what?<eos> Germaine didn't come to the office to talk to you.
! When I said that, Todd, I wasn't talking about things.<eos> - Hey, keep your voice down.<eos> - I was talking about a proposal.<eos> What?<eos> I thought you were going to propose to me on this trip.<eos> But instead, it was a "Hangover 2" locations tour.<eos> You love the Wolf Pack.<eos> When I first met you, I thought you were the coolest senior at ASU.<eos> - I was.<eos> - And when we both graduated, I followed you to Scottsdale because we had fun together.
We're gonna explore your unconscious.<eos> It's gonna be a lot of fun.<eos> I, for one, am very excited about being inside you.<eos> That's very weird.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Hey, where's my SkyMall?<eos> I lost it.<eos> Okay?<eos> Yeesh!<eos> What's up with you?
There's something I need to show you.<eos> Todd?<eos> I gave you a chance to tell them yourself.<eos> Fine.<eos> Coming in!<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Look, Jess, the truth is, I was going to propose to you on this trip.<eos> I was just... waiting for the perfect moment.<eos> But then I realized... that every moment with you is perfection.
Are we taking that at face value, sir, that he killed himself?<eos> Not face value, no, Alec. But he was wanted for murder. He was on his own, and there's no sign of a struggle.<eos> We will investigate thoroughly, and if there's reason to doubt the cause of death, you will be the first to know.<eos> Now, boy scouts and girl scouts, burn it into your brows,<eos> I want that weapon.<eos> Thanks, Alec, you know, about last night.<eos> -For looking after me.<eos> -Oh, no.<eos> Look, are you, um...<eos> Are you all right?
But will it be able to do so before we can bring navigation back online and make the jump to FTL?<eos> I'm taking you back to Zairon.<eos> I'll happily go back, but only to retake my throne.<eos> Your claim to the throne died along with our father.<eos> - I didn't kill him.<eos> - Liar.<eos> You agreed to meet me on equal footing, a neutral location where we can both speak.<eos> But instead you sent Akita-san in your place.<eos> You broke your word.<eos> I had every intention of meeting you that day but...
He was an impediment.<eos> He was my brother.<eos> I've made the arrangements.<eos> Tomorrow night I will address the people of Zairon on the status of our war with The Republic of Pyr.<eos> Immediately following my prepared speech, I will abdicate the throne.<eos> - You've taken precautions?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Mother still holds influence over certain generals.<eos> I'll have a half dozen ships in orbit awaiting my instructions, ready to descend on Zairon should anyone try to stop us.<eos> I should be there with you.
I have to confess, I did see him naked on the roof.<eos> I did, too, and I was at 10,000 feet.<eos> Now for the final fantasy.<eos> Oh, my love, my love, losing you so young, so beautiful.<eos> Still no jokes.<eos> I love you, and how.<eos> You're too good for heaven, man.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Welcome, Monty.<eos> I'd like to take a selfie with you.
And tell me it's not a computer acronym like Repeating Algorithm for Calculating Hotel...<eos> Come on, Lou, help me out here. No, no, no.<eos> You got yourself into that acronym. You can, uh, get yourself out.<eos> Lou stands for lousy, obstinate, um...<eos> Uh, help me out here, Lou. I had no real friends.<eos> So I played with my imaginary friend, Rachel.<eos> We did it all together.<eos> I was maid of honor at her imaginary wedding. But then I outgrew her.<eos> And I never saw Rachel or wore this nail polish again.<eos> That's a nice story, kid, but, uh, we're keeping our eye on you.

You idiot, now you're trapped here with us.<eos> Idiot. Ow!<eos> I should have used a coaster.<eos> You know we're only 13, right? Come with me.<eos> I didn't know the pool table could do that.<eos> Halloween show money.<eos> Yeah, you see, kid, it turns out the guys you thought were wasting' time in this bar were actually covert agents helpin' to save the world. So, how did things go in Prague?<eos> Oh, quite well.<eos> I canceled a few Czechs.<eos> We've had our eye on you since your father... our best man... died.
Tess, I believe you.<eos> Of all the people in your life, how many actually believe you?<eos> None of 'em.<eos> So have a little faith in those of us who have faith.<eos> It's dreams that connect us.<eos> You experienced it.<eos> What we don't know is how those connections work, but with your help, I was hoping we could figure that out.<eos> How do you know so much about me?<eos> Truth?<eos> I stalked you.
They need a comm specialist.<eos> You're serious?<eos> Are you serious right now?<eos> I've just been thinking, man.<eos> What am I gonna do?<eos> Join the academy?<eos> Be a 31-year-old rookie?<eos> Come on.<eos> Over there, I got stripes.<eos> Do you forget what it did to you?
- Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Okay, sweetie...<eos> Yeah, but what I'm saying is, is, maybe it's time to file a complaint.<eos> - Against the commander?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You know how it looks like for a female officer to scream sexual harassment?<eos> I'd be the last in line for every promotion, plus I've got nothing to prove.<eos> It's just my word against his.<eos> Me and Platt... we would back that Fogel's stalking you.
'Cause helping Darius Burns...<eos> That's not gonna help anybody.<eos> And here I was worried I was gonna wake you up.<eos> Donna, what are you doing here?<eos> What happened to your face?<eos> I lost my temper.<eos> That's all you're gonna say?<eos> I'll tell you the rest some other time.<eos> Better question is, uh, what are you doing here so early?<eos> Well, I-I tried to reach you, and when I couldn't, I just came out 'cause I, uh... I need to talk to you about this.
But he's acting... differently.<eos> He's really fixated on you, in an unhealthy way.<eos> And maybe I'm overreacting, but I-I... I'm worried that things between the two of you are only going to get worse.<eos> I appreciate the warning.<eos> But as you can see, I've, uh... I've taken steps to make sure I'm safe.<eos> These guards are here to protect you from my dad?<eos> Cady.<eos> Nobody knows what threats the world holds for them.<eos> You can't know.<eos> All you can do is surround yourself with people you trust to look after you.
Let's start with 25 a year and see how it goes.<eos> $25,000?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got to... I got to put these away.<eos> Okay.<eos> Eight.<eos> One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.<eos> Hey!<eos> That is not yours!<eos> I've been following you, so I know your boyfriend, the sheriff, isn't here to help you this time.
We're putting together a sweat.<eos> You know, like, a ceremony.<eos> And we're getting a friend who's a medicine man.<eos> The whole deal.<eos> A sweat?<eos> That's...<eos> I'm really touched.<eos> I'm a little surprised, though.<eos> You have been doing a lot for this tribe.<eos> No, I'm... I'm surprised by you.
I don't know if her phone died or what.<eos> Anne...<eos> I will drive you home.<eos> Just tell me the way.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> That's it, but why aren't the lights on?<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> I knew it.<eos> Do you want me to come inside with you?
They can't move anywhere.<eos> They're broke as shit.<eos> Their house got foreclosed on.<eos> - Well, that sucks.<eos> - But there's a bright side.<eos> I'm opening a legal-aid center here to help people in trouble on the Res.<eos> That's cute.<eos> So, uh, can I hang here for a little bit longer?<eos> J.P.'s probably had a beer and a shot by now, and it usually takes, um, three to calm him down.<eos> You know the guy who was chasing you?
So, uh, can I hang here for a little bit longer?<eos> J.P.'s probably had a beer and a shot by now, and it usually takes, um, three to calm him down.<eos> You know the guy who was chasing you?<eos> Yeah. J.P.<eos> Is he your boyfriend?<eos> No.<eos> Ex.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Now he's someone else's problem.<eos> So, why is he chasing you?
You know what I used to do when I was a teenager?<eos> This is silly.<eos> I mean, it's beautiful, and it's very sweet, but...<eos> Wait.<eos> What...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> A cassette?<eos> - A cassette tape?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh, you just got all the girls, didn't you?
You should probably bring this.<eos> Hey, since Ferg's gonna be in Colorado, do you think you and I should go check out Tony's last place of employment here?<eos> What is it... Powder River Rafting?<eos> Uh, you go ahead.<eos> I'm gonna follow up on the autopsy report and read some poetry.<eos> If the clue to the treasure is here, maybe the clue to his death is here, too.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, are you Spence?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Your boss said I should talk to you.
This thing looks pretty flimsy.<eos> You should probably stand back, Meg.<eos> Such a badass.<eos> I'm telling you, it feels like nobody's lived here for... ever.<eos> So there's no furniture at all?<eos> Um, well, there's a bed, side table, um...<eos> - No, no, no, no. Don't touch that.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey.<eos> I can't take your call, so leave a message.<eos> Ferg, who's there with you?
And I still loved him.<eos> But he didn't love you.<eos> He was going to divorce you.<eos> Because of you!<eos> - Because you were so horrible to him!<eos> - No.<eos> He was going to divorce you for your money.<eos> He had a lawyer.<eos> He came here, and he said right to my face that he was going after your inheritance.<eos> I couldn't let him do that to you, to... to us.
- Doesn't matter.<eos> You're a white woman who shot a white man.<eos> Tribal law doesn't apply to you.<eos> Your case gets kicked up to the state.<eos> So as long as this house belongs to someone, you're golden.<eos> Now, who's Asha?<eos> She's a client.<eos> Uh, I served her husband with a restraining order.<eos> He's the one who attacked us.<eos> So she was with you at the time.
Yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> We'll just follow and photograph every adult traveling from Boston to Wyoming.<eos> Shouldn't be a problem.<eos> You do realize the whole "needle in a haystack" absurdity of all this, - don't you?<eos> - You know what, Ferg?<eos> Just go hang out with your girlfriend, 'cause I got this, okay?<eos> You know, I don't mind the extra work if it gets a bull's-eye off Walt's back, all right?<eos> Okay. Don't bite my head off.<eos> What is with you these days?
Why would I want him dead?<eos> Because he pulled out of your business arrangement at the casino.<eos> He canceled all the reservations for Manifest Destinations.<eos> I wasn't aware of that.<eos> In fact, I'm the one who pulled out of the casino, just as you and I agreed.<eos> Do we agree?<eos> Well, no.<eos> I suppose not formally.<eos> But after your visit, I did a profit-and-loss analysis, something I do on a regular basis.<eos> And I agreed with you.
I'm sorry, Mr. Wabash, but there's no smoking allowed in here.<eos> I'm sorry, Cindy.<eos> It will not happen again.<eos> People are so nice here.<eos> Shame I have to leave.<eos> But a deal's a deal, right, Sheriff?<eos> Asha.<eos> No, Asha, wait!<eos> Wait, please!<eos> I really need to speak with you.
You know, you think he doesn't know what goes on inside his own casino?<eos> Okay.<eos> Here's what actually happened.<eos> He did say no to his IRA buddies.<eos> But then he ordered me to go back and make a deal with those dirty Irishmen.<eos> He wanted them to deal with me and keep him out of it.<eos> So when your car was parked outside that hotel in Sheridan, you were negotiating with the mob on Nighthorse's behalf.<eos> Bingo.<eos> Shane told me they were pulling out.<eos> Said he wasn't making enough money to justify the trouble he had with this... damn new Hector and, of course, you.
Yep.<eos> I started to realize that doing everything the same way hasn't been working out too well, so...<eos> You ever think about giving it all up?<eos> Living a safe, simple life... where you don't need Kevlar?<eos> Well, I certainly wouldn't blame you if that's what you wanted.<eos> Maybe someday.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm going.<eos> Hold on.<eos> I'm going with you.
Petty and greedy.<eos> Willing to stand by and watch him humiliate me just to get your bar back.<eos> That is not why I am here.<eos> I am here because of a boy named Mingan.<eos> You know nothing about him, and I am sure you do not care.<eos> But your heroin killed his father.<eos> And the violence and the fear and the helplessness you spread through the tribe killed Mingan.<eos> That is why I am here... and why you will never come back.<eos> You thought it was bad when I owned you, Hank?<eos> But who owns you now?

- Are you gonna go talk to Nighthorse?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> I need to see what we can find out before I confront him.<eos> First, I'm gonna head over to the Red Pony, see if there's been any sign of Malachi there.<eos> - Vic.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> You're picking up Walter's bad habits.<eos> You don't answer your phone anymore?<eos> Sorry, uh, we were out of cell range.<eos> Well, the Assistant District Attorney has been trying to get a hold of you.
Yeah, well, more like two hours, sweetie.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh, no, it's fine.<eos> Um, I guess I need to go get myself ready.<eos> - Vic.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Before you go, could I see you for a minute?<eos> Sure.<eos> I've been so distracted lately, I haven't taken time to talk with you about the Chance Gilbert trial.
Uh, no, it's fine.<eos> Um, I guess I need to go get myself ready.<eos> - Vic.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Before you go, could I see you for a minute?<eos> Sure.<eos> I've been so distracted lately, I haven't taken time to talk with you about the Chance Gilbert trial.<eos> Well, someone has been trying to kill you.<eos> Anyway, it's not exactly something I've been wanting to talk about.<eos> Would it help if I came to the courthouse with you?
Oh, man.<eos> That's one hell of a right hook.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm also a good shot, so you're lucky you just got the fist.<eos> Well, you shouldn't be punching your baby's father, anyway.<eos> Travis.<eos> Look, there is a good possibility that you are not the father, all right?<eos> So... there was somebody else?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Who?<eos> Okay, I am not discussing my sex life with you, so if that's why you came back...
Not even Ann-Marie Bowen?<eos> Now, I... I saw you tearing these down.<eos> He's a nice-looking boy.<eos> You ever meet him?<eos> Because I did.<eos> I've seen their rituals.<eos> They took me to a house.<eos> They laid me on the floor.<eos> They took me places.<eos> Did they do that to you?
Our parents' generation uses it for mind control...<eos> Interrogating prisoners, for example.<eos> But we use it... as mind expansion, as you'll see.<eos> No pressuring.<eos> You can sit this out, Joe.<eos> You seem like you're open to it, but if you're not ready yet to explore inner space...<eos> It's deeper, darker, chaotic.<eos> You said that already.<eos> You can trust me, Joe.<eos> I'll be here for you the whole time.
You're growing on me, too, Bob.<eos> What's that word mean?<eos> Unequal.<eos> You're a grown man, Mr. McCarthy.<eos> When are you going to step out of your friend's shadow and spread your wings?<eos> Me and Frank take care of each other.<eos> Wish me luck, Bob.<eos> Wait.<eos> You know nothing of the linguistic nuances of Japanese and are therefore liable to say something that might get me killed too.<eos> I'll come with you.
Been doing what I said I was gonna do.<eos> I'm getting you out.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> Do I look like I'm kidding?<eos> So take that phone of yours, call Jill, and tell her you're coming home-- tonight.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> You really did that for me?<eos> I did.<eos> What about you?<eos> I'm getting out with you.
- I just got out of prison.<eos> I'm not trying to go back.<eos> - You're not going back, because even though you'll be acting as a lawyer, your title's gonna be "consultant."<eos> - Look, Harvey, I appreciate the gesture, but... everyone left that firm because of me.<eos> I'm not gonna do that to you again.<eos> - Mike--<eos> - No, listen to me.<eos> You've done enough, you don't have to do this for me.<eos> - I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it for me.<eos> I miss working with you.
- Louis.<eos> - Don't tell me.<eos> It's his. - Louis, I'm so sorry.<eos> I didn't mean for this to happen.<eos> I'm usually so careful.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - Louis, I don't think you know what you're saying.<eos> - No, I know exactly what I'm saying.<eos> I love you.<eos> And if being with you means raising another man's child, then I'll raise another man's child.
- My wife, she left me two years after I went away.<eos> She said she couldn't handle it anymore.<eos> - And what about your children?<eos> Do you still see them?<eos> - I haven't seen my son in over ten years.<eos> And I hadn't seen Maya until you found her and told her I was innocent and you were going to prove it.<eos> That's her right there.<eos> - Leonard, is there something that you would like to say to her?<eos> - I lost 12 years for a crime I didn't commit.<eos> But I won't regret any of it if it ends up being the thing that got me clean and reunited with you.
- I have some bad news I have to give Louis, and since he and I are finally in a good place...<eos> - You want to know how to break it to him without blowing things up again.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - How bad is it?<eos> - It's not good.<eos> - Then do what you just did with me.<eos> Approach him with respect, pull the Band-Aid off, and if you have that same look on your face as you do right now, he'll send you on your way with a handshake.<eos> - Thanks, Donna.<eos> - Stu?<eos> It was nice having you here.
But Tara, you need to know that I am not gonna say yes today and change my mind tomorrow.<eos> And I don't know how to give you that reassurance without asking you something first.<eos> - Oh, my God, Louis.<eos> - Tara Messer.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> - Yes, Louis.<eos> I'll marry you.<eos> - Jessica.<eos> What're you doing here?<eos> - I wanted to talk to you before you left for Chicago.
- Tara Messer.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> - Yes, Louis.<eos> I'll marry you.<eos> - Jessica.<eos> What're you doing here?<eos> - I wanted to talk to you before you left for Chicago.<eos> - I'm glad, but I wouldn't have left without saying good-bye.<eos> - I didn't just come here to say good-bye.<eos> I came to see what you think about me coming with you.
- I'm glad, but I wouldn't have left without saying good-bye.<eos> - I didn't just come here to say good-bye.<eos> I came to see what you think about me coming with you.<eos> - What about the firm?<eos> - I'm leaving the firm.<eos> - Jessica, if you're walking away from everything for me--<eos> - No, I'm not doing this just for you.<eos> I'm doing this for me.<eos> I don't want to be a corporate lawyer anymore.<eos> So, if you don't want me to come to Chicago with you, I won't.
the danger. I mean, you had this, and then all of a sudden, it was like panic mode.<eos> I-I didn't know what to do, if I should go up there or what.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I-I have to stop.<eos> I'll just meet you at the car.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Yes?<eos> Please tell me Nicole is with you.
That was for this.<eos> Some doctors up there I was working with.<eos> And we kind of dropped the ball, but now it looks like there might be some renewed interest.<eos> So how'd it go?<eos> A work in progress.<eos> You know that book reminds me of when we were sitting on the porch.<eos> You were about 3, and you said the words "outer space" just like that, out of the blue.<eos> And I asked you if you knew where outer space was, and you pointed down the street and said, "Down there."<eos> Well, I guess that's where I thought it was.<eos> What's going on with you, Nic?
It gets lonely out here in the Apocalypse.<eos> People are getting fewer and fewer and meaner and meaner.<eos> You know, kid?<eos> Kid?<eos> How you feeling?<eos> That's okay.<eos> You sleep it off.<eos> That cocktail I gave you would have whooped my ass too, for sure.<eos> I dunno how much more of this zombie shit I'm gonna be able to put up with.<eos> With Warren and Addy gone, if anything else happened to you, I might just have to go out in a blaze of zombie glory.
We've been looking all over for you!<eos> What happened to me?<eos> What happened to you?<eos> Ah, you didn't see the horde of spider zombies?<eos> Spider zombies?<eos> Damn.<eos> No.<eos> They were covered in black widows, man.<eos> Black widow spiders crawling with them.<eos> Okay, so what happened to you?
Cahill sanctioned it.<eos> And if anyone's insane, it's you, 'cause you're the one turning down a chance to get out of that place.<eos> But we don't have time to talk about that right now.<eos> Cahill's waiting for us.<eos> You got me out to see Cahill?<eos> I said he's waiting.<eos> I didn't say that's where I'm taking you.<eos> Well, then where the hell are you taking me?<eos> You think me spending a couple of hours with Rachel is gonna change my mind?<eos> If it doesn't, there's something wrong with you.
No, Louis, it's not going to be perfect.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We said we were gonna do this together, and I am a part of this firm as much as you are, and when you go ahead and you do something like this without me, it really pisses me off.<eos> Donna, I'm sorry.<eos> I just wanted to prove to myself that I could not screw this up.<eos> Well, don't come running to me when you do.<eos> Oh, please tell me you're making just plain old mashed potatoes.<eos> I am getting so sick of that Au gratin bullshit they keep serving us.<eos> Why don't you take it up with the cook?<eos> Well, what if I want to take it up with you?
- William.<eos> I got something for you.<eos> I assume it's an engagement letter for me to sign.<eos> It's the SEC form you're gonna have to file for buying 5% of Nathan Burns's company.<eos> So you know.<eos> I don't just know.<eos> I bought a seat at the table, and I got Nathan and the board on my side.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> None of you have the balls to go up against me.<eos> I'm not here to go up against you, William.
- What are you talking about?<eos> When Kevin finds out I told his father-in-law to drop dead, he's never gonna trust Mike.<eos> If you're saying what I think you're saying, you're not taking this man as your client.<eos> Yes, I am, because if I don't, we might as well not even be doing this.<eos> - Then let's not do it.<eos> - Look where we are, Sean.<eos> We're in a car, sneaking Mike into prison.<eos> You pulled every string you have to make this happen.<eos> You're gonna pull out now?<eos> I am, 'cause I'm not gonna put myself in position to collude with you.
- I didn't do shit to him!<eos> - Good for you.<eos> Who do you think they're gonna believe, a former prosecutor like me or an informant convict like you?<eos> Of course, if I'm your attorney, I can't tell them any of that.<eos> You son of a bitch.<eos> You set me up.<eos> I sure as hell did.<eos> So it's up to you.<eos> You in or you out?<eos> Can I talk to you a second?
I know what it was about.<eos> Really?<eos> What is that?<eos> I miss you, Donna.<eos> I miss having you as my secretary.<eos> I miss you too, Louis.<eos> And don't get me wrong.<eos> I'm not saying Gretchen's not great.<eos> Who would?<eos> It's just... I'm just saying she's not you.
- The drunk driving.<eos> - You knew?<eos> - I just found out.<eos> - Well, then you also know it's probably not the best time for me to chum up to him.<eos> I'm not asking you to chum up to him.<eos> I'm asking you to piss him off.<eos> - What are you talking about? - Kevin knows something, and he's not talking.<eos> So we could sit around here for the next two years waiting for him to tell you, or we can light a fire under his ass by reminding him that Sutter's out there, while he's in here.<eos> Now, are you with me or not?<eos> I'm with you.
- Yeah, right.<eos> I'm sorry, what was that?<eos> Are you disputing the fact that he's grateful to you?<eos> I'm not answering that question.<eos> This isn't getting us anywhere.<eos> He's getting you ready for Cahill.<eos> I wouldn't have to get ready for Cahill if you did your goddamn job and got this case dismissed.<eos> That's right, get someone else to cover up your mess like you always do.<eos> You got something you want to say to me?<eos> I got something I want to do to you.
Please.<eos> Tara, please wait.<eos> You know, I've heard about people like you.<eos> You're trying to get free design work out of me, so you can decide whether or not you want to buy this house.<eos> That has nothing to do with it.<eos> Really?<eos> Because, first, you tried to get me to work on this without even seeing the space.<eos> Then you lured me out here under false pretenses.<eos> So why don't you tell me what, exactly, is going on here?<eos> I lied to you about owning a house in the Hamptons so I could spend time with you.
Because I am a professional secretary, Louis.<eos> I'm not here to help you play hide the Litt with some strumpet.<eos> - She so doesn't get me.<eos> - You know what, Louis? She has a point.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> A lot of manpower has been devoted to your pursuit of this virtual stranger.<eos> And by manpower, I mean my precious time.<eos> So I think it's time that you took care of this yourself.<eos> Goddamn it. Don't you think if I could have I would have?<eos> What I think is, if you can't figure out how to have a simple date with a woman who's already agreed to go out with you, then maybe you don't deserve to go out with her in the first place.
Well, I'm telling you there are worse things you could be.<eos> Why are you so interested in my well being?<eos> Because I'm your friend and I was in your position.<eos> And I decided it was better to give it all up than to keep looking over my shoulder waiting for the ax to fall.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You know I was a fraud, right?<eos> You know I did it for years.<eos> What you don't know is that I quit 20 minutes before I got arrested.<eos> And it was 20 of the most peaceful minutes of my entire life.<eos> Yeah, well, look at what happened to you anyways.
Previously on Wrecked...<eos> Yolonzo!<eos> Yolonzo?<eos> - Yolonzo's dead.<eos> - What?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> We got to keep you out of sight because if they knew you were down here, they'd eat you.<eos> You chowed down on a dead dude, and now he's talking to you.
- She never... She never stops talking about you.<eos> - No.<eos> - She's always, like, "Corey's the best."<eos> - Who?<eos> Meat, Meat!<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Hey, hey, buddy.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> I told you I'd come back for you.
You're not from this world, are you?<eos> Is that bad?<eos> It's wonderful.<eos> If you'll excuse me,<eos> I have a quick piece of business, but I'll return.<eos> Don't go anywhere.<eos> Oh. Thank you.<eos> I'm so excited.<eos> Do you know who they're laughing at?<eos> They're laughing at you.
If you'll excuse me,<eos> I have a quick piece of business, but I'll return.<eos> Don't go anywhere.<eos> Oh. Thank you.<eos> I'm so excited.<eos> Do you know who they're laughing at?<eos> They're laughing at you.<eos> Do you really think he would choose you over her?<eos> But he... but he danced with me.<eos> He was making fun of you, dear.
Who are they?<eos> Fuck if I know.<eos> He gave the dog to the girl.<eos> Do we stay with him?<eos> D?<eos> No.<eos> Uh, too risky to follow on foot.<eos> Let's call it a day.<eos> - Hey, honey.<eos> - Did you get the apartment?
That's what you said.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> But who's deciding?<eos> That's what we have to settle now.<eos> Just you and me.<eos> Right and wrong.<eos> Who's deciding which is which?<eos> You tell me.<eos> Other people.<eos> Other people who don't think about you for longer than they have to, and then they're gone.
I heard a man.<eos> Did you recognize his voice?<eos> I think it was Sean.<eos> Sean Roberts?<eos> The guy we just got out of prison?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ashley Harper was raped and stabbed, and you think that Sean Roberts is involved in this... how?<eos> Well, Melanie said she heard Sean's voice in the house.<eos> Well, we know that they went out together last night.<eos> Did you talk to him yet? Well, considering the history, we figured we should talk to you first.
I know how much you loved Ashley.<eos> But I cared about her, too.<eos> She gave me hope I could start over.<eos> She wasn't afraid to be alone with me. She didn't look at me like I was dirt, like everyone else.<eos> Then that night, I was drunk.<eos> I wasn't used to that. I went over there to talk to her, to say I was sorry for how I acted at dinner.<eos> And I told her how much I liked her...<eos> And she just sort of laughed.<eos> And that was it.<eos> You can't let people laugh at you.
To avoid admitting that he was in love with Eva.<eos> Even if he tells the truth... that he was seeking revenge because of Eva's death... he could still be staring down a murder charge.<eos> Look, the guy finds out that the love of his life has just died after being beaten and raped with a pipe.<eos> I mean, it sounds like heat of the moment to me.<eos> No.<eos> He had three hours to cool down.<eos> He stole Vincent Love's gun.<eos> Then he drove 60 blocks looking for his victim, and he shot him in cold blood.<eos> To me, that sounds like murder.<eos> Well, if the victim wasn't such a hate-filled, pipe-wielding rapist, then I'd be more inclined to agree with you.
No?<eos> Okay, can you follow those officers for me?<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Hey, hey. Hey, no, no, no, don't move.<eos> Don't move, don't move, don't move.<eos> I'm the police.<eos> I'm the police... you gonna be okay.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> Okay, I got you.
Hey, hey, hey.<eos> I'm on the job!<eos> Get me a medic!<eos> I need a medic right now!<eos> Please... not like... not like this.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> It's not gonna be like this.<eos> Okay?<eos> It's not gonna be like this.<eos> I got you.
I've heard a lot of good things about you.<eos> No, you haven't.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's just keep this short and sweet, even if we all have to fake it.<eos> Sweetheart, I've been meaning to call you Beca...<eos> Jay, would you mind?<eos> Could we just have one minute?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - No.<eos> What is wrong with you?
Talking of delicious, what's on the menu, Mrs M?<eos> Wild mushroom soup, roast lamb and my summer pudding.<eos> Well, we certainly put on a good spread.<eos> We?<eos> Best left to the professionals, isn't that right, Father?<eos> I think that's wisest.<eos> No, she doesn't get off that lightly!<eos> Here you are, madam.<eos> I need three pounds of wild mushrooms for my soup.<eos> I take it you do know what a wild mushroom looks like?

The usual.<eos> We drank and danced, and worked some magic.<eos> Can I ask what the usual dress code is for this sort of occasion?<eos> The traditional witch's costume - that is to say, the skin.<eos> Naked.<eos> Can I ask what this is about?<eos> The alleged assault of a young woman last night.<eos> Early 20s, dusky skinned, which makes her easy to identify.<eos> We don't get a lot of exotics in Kembleford.<eos> Then I imagine you are looking for me.

Great minds, it seems.<eos> Hardly.<eos> I'm on a fungi hunt.<eos> And they are elusive little beasts.<eos> Oh, well, perhaps you need a knight to aid you in your quest.<eos> Dione Moon.<eos> D-I-O-N-E.<eos> M-O-O-N.<eos> Thank you, Miss Moon.<eos> And you were at this gathering last night?
Can you explain why we found blood on the floor?<eos> My offering of the essence of life to the deities.<eos> Fortunately, a few drops are usually sufficient.<eos> So you claim you were unharmed?<eos> I can prove it, if you like.<eos> Ritual scourging transcends us to a higher place - inflicts pain without damage.<eos> Would you like a closer look, inspector?<eos> I think we've seen enough, thank you.<eos> "Trees which are good for mushroom hunting include "beech, oak, birch and pine."<eos> Do you know your beech from your birches, Reverend Allsworthy?

You are young and, dare I say, sheltered.<eos> This dinner of Father Brown's, it's highly inappropriate.<eos> I take people as I find them.<eos> And aside from being partially clothed, I found them to be perfectly charming.<eos> Well, it is they who have charmed you.<eos> And I fear they aren't the only ones.<eos> Father Brown is...<eos> He's well-meaning.<eos> But hardly someone to look to for moral guidance.<eos> There are things about him I doubt you're aware of.

There are things about him I doubt you're aware of.<eos> I feel as though you're about to enlighten me.<eos> He has a reputation as a trouble seeker.<eos> I believe the police find him very tiresome and his bishop is just waiting for an opportunity to have him...<eos> Oops-a-daisy.<eos> I'm stuck on a root.<eos> Would you give me a hand?<eos> I think you already have one.<eos> Kembleford Police Station.<eos> Can you give me a precise location?
Can you give me a precise location?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, don't touch anything.<eos> I'll get reinforcements to you as soon as possible.<eos> I'll leave you to write up the report.<eos> Adios, sergeant.<eos> Sir, wait!<eos> A body's been found up at Crows Wood.<eos> Could this day get any better?<eos> What were you doing in Crows Wood?

Query stone.<eos> Date of death is anyone's guess.<eos> Is the police surgeon on his way?<eos> He is, sir, yes. Er...<eos> Some time in March would be my guess.<eos> Oh, pray, do enlighten us.<eos> Well, the soles of the shoes are covered in bluebell leaves which appear in March but no sign of the flowers, which bloomed in the second week in April, as I recall.<eos> And... I also found this.<eos> Removal of evidence.<eos> I was about to give it to the sergeant when you appeared.

Case was closed.<eos> She only lived a mile from that godforsaken place.<eos> And given what Goggles Malone saw...<eos> Mr Malone's allegation was investigated and found to be unsubstantiated.<eos> Not quite, sir.<eos> I stand corrected.<eos> Found to be down to misinterpretation.<eos> So if you'll excuse me, my sergeant here will show you out, allowing me to get on with my enquiries.<eos> This way, gentlemen.<eos> So you didn't manage to bring back a single mushroom?

MIM.<eos> LP.<eos> She was catching a train.<eos> Somehow I doubt that.<eos> What woman would travel from the back of beyond to London in the clothes she stood up in?<eos> With me, Bunty.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Crows Wood.<eos> Well, you might bring me back some mushrooms while you're there!<eos> You know, this is a Hundred Acre Wood.
Where are we going?<eos> Crows Wood.<eos> Well, you might bring me back some mushrooms while you're there!<eos> You know, this is a Hundred Acre Wood.<eos> We've as much chance of finding a bear of very little brain.<eos> And even if she had a bag, maybe the murderer stole it?<eos> And leave her jewellery?<eos> So why not bury it with the body?<eos> Well, maybe they didn't want their victim to be identified.<eos> Well, I vote we take a breather and you pray for a miracle.
I somehow doubt it.<eos> Someone packed in a hurry.<eos> Spelling prize 1931.<eos> St John The Baptist Primary School.<eos> "Eruditio et Religio."<eos> So we know she was a good speller.<eos> It also seems she was a witch.<eos> Lilith's.<eos> She's... she was a member of our coven.<eos> What can you tell me about her?
It also seems she was a witch.<eos> Lilith's.<eos> She's... she was a member of our coven.<eos> What can you tell me about her?<eos> She was a free spirit.<eos> Her full name would do for starters.<eos> Lilith Lafitte.<eos> She was a poet.<eos> Quite well known in literary circles.<eos> When did you last see her?
What can you tell me about her?<eos> She was a free spirit.<eos> Her full name would do for starters.<eos> Lilith Lafitte.<eos> She was a poet.<eos> Quite well known in literary circles.<eos> When did you last see her?<eos> The 29th March.<eos> The day after our spring equinox.<eos> And you didn't see or hear from her after that?
Nor yours to hoard.<eos> It's a new world, Selina.<eos> There's no room in it for retrogrades.<eos> Then I will not circle with you.<eos> It would have been a tad melodramatic to throw her out.<eos> She packed her things and left for the station.<eos> Did anyone see her leave?<eos> Are we to assume we're under suspicion?<eos> We've ruled out robbery and sexual motive, which leaves the possibility that she knew her killer.<eos> So I'd like you all to account for your whereabouts at the time.
For your adversary, the devil... ..as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour!<eos> They come into our community, flaunting heresy.<eos> And while the police drag their feet, well, do we lock up our womenfolk?<eos> Or do we protect ourselves?<eos> Yes!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Excuse me, it's an emergency.<eos> Mortal at the very least.<eos> A mortal sin, no less?<eos> There's about to be if you don't get to Crows Corner, statim!
Mortal at the very least.<eos> A mortal sin, no less?<eos> There's about to be if you don't get to Crows Corner, statim!<eos> There shall not be found among you anyone who burns his son or his daughter as an offering, anyone who practises divination or tells fortunes or interprets omens, or a sorcerer or a charmer or a medium or a necromancer or one who inquires of the dead.<eos> We don't want 'em here!<eos> For whoever does these things is an abomination.<eos> This is getting out of hand.<eos> An ordered protest, we said.<eos> If they don't leave, we'll smoke 'em out.<eos> Think what you're doing.

Shame on you all.<eos> Murderers!<eos> They're murderers!<eos> On what evidence?<eos> Who else would murder a black-eyed witch but one of their own?<eos> Does anyone have evidence?<eos> Shall we have a show of hands?<eos> No-one?<eos> Go home, please, all of you, before you do something you cannot undo.<eos> It seems that you are a lone voice in our defence.
She hypnotised you.<eos> Although it didn't take you long to find a replacement.<eos> A toast.<eos> Lilith.<eos> Lilith.<eos> Lilith.<eos> Miss Windermere!<eos> Miss Windermere.<eos> Has something happened?<eos> Oh, haven't you heard?
Lilith.<eos> Lilith.<eos> Lilith.<eos> Miss Windermere!<eos> Miss Windermere.<eos> Has something happened?<eos> Oh, haven't you heard?<eos> Dragged through a hedge backwards is quite the look this season.<eos> Either that or a sadistic madwoman forced me out into the woods at daybreak gather mushrooms.<eos> Here you are and I hope you're satisfied.

All this fuss about a bit of honest dirt.<eos> If you still think of attending this imprudent gathering, can I urge you to think of your reputation?<eos> I think it's a bit late for that.<eos> And the reputation of this village.<eos> Oh, you'd rather it had a reputation for burning people in their homes?<eos> Last night got out of hand and was... regrettable.<eos> But what sort of message is this going to send?<eos> That people are innocent until proved guilty?<eos> It is you who are the innocent and know nothing of life's depravities.<eos> You've never spoke a truer word, Reverend.
I know what I meant.<eos> I am late for the African orphans.<eos> So, if you can leave those at the back door and I will collect them later.<eos> I think Miss Windermere's got the wrong end of...<eos> If we're to be dinner companions, you must call me Penelope.<eos> If I may call you Peter?<eos> The evil spreads, and one by one they suck you in.<eos> I didn't... I haven't....<eos> So shall I pick you up at seven?<eos> I'm so glad you decided to come.
Now, dinner is served.<eos> So if you'd all like to find yourselves a seat.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> I'm afraid I have to leave.<eos> A parish emergency.<eos> Sick call, an ailing person.<eos> Don't wait for me.<eos> Mrs McCarthy will explain.<eos> Hello?<eos> I hope you don't mind.
Like you, my door is always open.<eos> Unless this is another attempt to persuade me to your infernal gathering.<eos> No.<eos> I'm here about the murdered woman.<eos> I... know nothing of the witch.<eos> She was raised a Methodist.<eos> Her school motto was Eruditio et Religio from the hymn by Charles Wesley.<eos> What if she was?<eos> I didn't know her.<eos> You knew what she looked like.
There is no hell.<eos> No day of judgment.<eos> And we will not meet again.<eos> Oh, my God, my God... why hast thou forsaken me?<eos> And then... his purpose revealed itself.<eos> 'A man also and a woman that hath a familiar spirit, 'or is a wizard...<eos> '..shall surely be put to death.<eos> 'They shall stone them with stones.<eos> 'Their blood shall be upon them.'<eos> You killed your daughter.

I'm so, so sorry.<eos> I obeyed the word of God.<eos> That is not God's will.<eos> You're blind.<eos> The evil enters like a needle and spreads like an oak.<eos> The evil is in your mind.<eos> For your own sake, give up this crusade and seek God's forgiveness.<eos> It's too late.<eos> They're all condemned, in this life and the next.<eos> What have you done?
I poisoned evil at the roots.<eos> Paganism gave birth to Christianity. Bequeathed her festivals.<eos> Easter is named after Eostre, the great mother goddess of the Saxons.<eos> I don't think this is appropriate conversation for the dinner table.<eos> I'd say it's just taken a turn for the better.<eos> Stop!<eos> Don't... ..eat the soup.<eos> Something tells me this isn't good news.<eos> Gillespie poisoned it with destroying angels.<eos> What are you talking about?
Gillespie poisoned it with destroying angels.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Deadly mushrooms.<eos> Even half a one is lethal.<eos> Then we must get to a hospital.<eos> There's no antidote and the damage is done.<eos> I'd say we have a week at most.<eos> But this is not my time.<eos> A week... and one man I'd spend it with.<eos> Who would you chose?
I'd say we have a week at most.<eos> But this is not my time.<eos> A week... and one man I'd spend it with.<eos> Who would you chose?<eos> I'll save him the bother.<eos> You think I want his whingeing to be the last words I hear on this Earth?<eos> And trust me, he will whinge.<eos> Take him.<eos> You have my blessing.<eos> Is there one person you would spend your last days with?

I'll get a special licence and at least we can die as man and wife having been... fulfilled.<eos> What is all this talk of dying?<eos> Gillespie spiked the mushrooms with fatal fungi.<eos> Did he now?<eos> Then it's a good thing I didn't use them.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I threw them away.<eos> Oh, thank the Lord!<eos> We yield thee praise and thanksgiving...<eos> And these would be the same mushrooms that you forced me out into the wood to gather at daybreak?
Because I thought it might keep you out of trouble for a little while.<eos> But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then that should have turned them from their evil way, and the evil of their doings!<eos> Behold the mouthpiece of the Lord!<eos> Neither God nor a jury will convict me!<eos> He's got that right.<eos> I'll give you 2-1 on the nuthouse.<eos> Oh! Good morning!<eos> Good morning!<eos> I've come to redirect Eugene's mail.<eos> Oh! We heard you'd given him the heave-ho.
I think what she meant to say was, "We're sorry about that."<eos> Don't be.<eos> She's welcome to him, his arthritis, his ingrowing toenails and his wandering eye.<eos> Sometimes men are just more trouble than they're worth.<eos> Seconded.<eos> Time I skedaddled.<eos> You can't dodge him forever.<eos> For heaven's sake, put the poor man out of his misery.<eos> Very well, I'll do the dirty deed.<eos> You've been avoiding me.
You can't dodge him forever.<eos> For heaven's sake, put the poor man out of his misery.<eos> Very well, I'll do the dirty deed.<eos> You've been avoiding me.<eos> I know why.<eos> You do?<eos> My declaration was sudden and alarmed you.<eos> Let's just put it down to the heat of the moment.<eos> And yet I didn't imagine the warmth between us.<eos> And you still haven't given me your answer.

Dear friends, we've come together in this church on this day so that the Lord may strengthen and seal this union, so that Christ may bless this love.<eos> Do you have the ring?<eos> Francis Scott Fitzgerald, do you take Zelda Sayre for your lawful wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do you part?<eos> I do.<eos> Zelda Sayre, do you take Francis Scott Fitzgerald for your lawful husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do you part?<eos> I do.<eos> May the Lord bless and consecrate Scott and Zelda in their love for one another.<eos> I now pronounce you man and wife.<eos> I adore you.<eos> You be a good Catholic, Scott, and you be a good Episcopalian, Zelda, and everything will be fine.
How could you let this happen?<eos> Uh, the preacher started.<eos> You couldn't wait?<eos> Tilde, this is how the moderns do it.<eos> We don't wait for anything.<eos> Yes. Now's the fun part.<eos> Welcome to the Biltmore.<eos> I'll just get the key.<eos> That's my husband's book.<eos> You're reading my husband's book.
- ♫ But wait ♫ ♫ You ain't heard nothin' yet ♫<eos> ♫ She's got charms, such curvy arms ♫<eos> ♫ But you ain't heard nothin' yet ♫<eos> ♫ And when those arms are around my neck ♫<eos> ♫ Oh, believe me, boys, I'm set ♫<eos> ♫ And when the lights are turned down low ♫ ♫ I hug and kiss my pet ♫ ♫ Now she'd get sore if I told you more ♫<eos> ♫ But you ain't heard nothin' yet ♫<eos> Where is she?<eos> Where is my little Zelda Sayre?<eos> Oh, Zelda, there you are, darling.
Dear Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm not much of a reader.<eos> I usually just skip to my lines.<eos> But I say let's drink to your brilliant book.<eos> Hear, hear.<eos> Save me.<eos> My apologies on behalf of the Princeton crew.<eos> We're a bit much, taken all at once.<eos> Or individually.<eos> I've never seen him like this about anybody, you know?<eos> Hope you're ready.
Well, this last year has been fun.<eos> You know, really fun.<eos> I mean, I'm not gonna lie.<eos> You know, to have gotten so close to the presidency and then have the American people and Congress reject me was, um... was devastating.<eos> But, um...<eos> I did reacquaint myself with an old friend of mine by the name of Selina Meyer.<eos> And I like her.<eos> That's fantastic.<eos> If you're just joining us, former president and my old boss Selina Meyer is with us live for her first public appearance since the historic vote in the House of Representatives one year ago today.
Without him, we don't have a Chinaman's chance.<eos> - I'm sorry, Ben.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Here at Uber and in the rest of the world the word "Chinaman" is considered inappropriate.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> It's okay.<eos> My wife is Oriental.<eos> All of them have been.<eos> I kind of got yellow "fev-ah."<eos> Now, you've recently drawn some criticism... - Mm-hmm. - over an 11th-hour pardon of billionaire, private prison magnate Sherman Tanz, who's under indictment of tax evasion and bribery charges.
When I was a kid, I ate sloppy Joes, pizza on a bagel.<eos> The only green bean I ate was a green jelly bean and I grew up to be so tall, my stupid mom had to get a different car.<eos> I will fight against green beans the same way that I fought against my deadly disease called cancer.<eos> For the children.<eos> Yeah, well, I think sometimes people forget that I was the first female president.<eos> - Before Montez.<eos> - Oh, that's right.<eos> Well, speaking of President Laura Montez, she won the Nobel Peace Prize for her work in Tibet.<eos> Unprecedented.<eos> - What did you think of her speech? - Ugh.
- What did you think of her speech? - Ugh.<eos> I didn't really get a chance to see it because I was...<eos> I was out of the country.<eos> This is really great.<eos> - No! - Uh-oh.<eos> - Before I let you go...<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> I've got to ask what we're all thinking...<eos> - The White House. - Mm.<eos> So, you're definitely not gonna run again in three years?
Thanks, Danny.<eos> Danny Egan has been filling in as my cohost this week, and we think that he is doing a terrific job.<eos> We'll be right back with more "CBS This Morning."<eos> - And we're clear.<eos> - Okay, well, we got that done.<eos> Madam President, it's so good to see you.<eos> Jane!<eos> - Oh, for goodness sakes.<eos> - You let your hair grow.<eos> We should have lunch now that you're back.
- Yeah.<eos> Hey, thank you so much for doing this.<eos> I am so glad to hear that you're feeling better.<eos> Oh, come on, come on.<eos> Everything's... yes.<eos> - Gary.<eos> - Dan.<eos> So, how did I do?<eos> Somebody tell how I did.<eos> - Oh, my God, you were fantastic.
I am so glad to hear that you're feeling better.<eos> Oh, come on, come on.<eos> Everything's... yes.<eos> - Gary.<eos> - Dan.<eos> So, how did I do?<eos> Somebody tell how I did.<eos> - Oh, my God, you were fantastic.<eos> - Literally, anyone.<eos> - You were great, ma'am.
I mean, whose balls did I twerk to end up here, in the Triangle Shirtwaist offices?<eos> I mean, seriously, this is the worst place they've ever stuffed an ex-president, and I'm including JFK's coffin.<eos> Ooh, I'm gonna get you the same one.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Good.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Um, are there any messages for me?<eos> - No, ma'am.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - You were wonderful today.
Oh, well, that's nice.<eos> Tell them I accept.<eos> - Them?<eos> - It's "her."<eos> - Her.<eos> - Him.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Tell the bearded ladies I'm a-coming.<eos> And your editor called about the pages to your book.<eos> You're six months behind.
Start out by calling Mutual of Omaha.<eos> And I'm only flying there private.<eos> - And I'm certainly not gonna...<eos> - Is now a good time, Mom?<eos> Marjorie, come on in.<eos> You know, Marjorie, since you're now heading the Meyer Fund, it would be a good idea for you not to call me "Mom" here in the office.<eos> Of course, ma'am.<eos> Yes.<eos> So, did you see today's interview?<eos> I didn't know you were gonna give me AIDS.
But I think that will require a little bit more cash.<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> If you want to talk about the money thing...<eos> - Yes.<eos> - you can talk about it...<eos> - With Marjorie.<eos> - Great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Marjorie, when Mother died and she gave Catherine all of her money...<eos> You've been over your budget the last few months.
- What's up?<eos> I have an idea that I think is really gonna impress the network.<eos> Have you ever heard of Congressman Jonah Ryan from New Hampshire?<eos> Great interview.<eos> Charming guy.<eos> I can get him on the phone right now.<eos> Hey, ma'am, I got big news from the White House.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> What?<eos> - They want you to pick an artist for your official presidential portrait.
We have the National Auto Dealers for 100,000.<eos> You've gotta be kidding me.<eos> That's half of what Hughes gets.<eos> That is pure sexism.<eos> You call those people back and you tell them that I was the first female President of the United States and I will not work for less than 87 cents on the dollar.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> And tell them I'll stand at a glass podium and wear a short skirt.<eos> - What about Omaha?<eos> - They won't give us a private jet.<eos> And you said not to touch anything without a private jet.
- That's what I said.<eos> I'm on the phone, okay?<eos> You're as bad as these dogs.<eos> - Is that her?<eos> - Ma'am...<eos> Tell her now.<eos> Tell her or I'll tell her.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Wendy and I were talking that if you're gonna keep using the diary, maybe you should start paying me.
But wait, I need the diary.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Ma'am, great news.<eos> We got Marty Leonhardt's G5 for Omaha.<eos> Really?<eos> Great!<eos> All righty!<eos> Omaha's a go, go, go.<eos> Ma'am, you've been to Omaha before.
Omaha is a 20-minute drive right across the border to Council Bluffs, Iowa...<eos> Beautiful.<eos> where they have their annual Madison Monroe dinner.<eos> Fun!<eos> Which you have to go to if you're gonna run for president again.<eos> Huh?<eos> I'm gonna run for president again.<eos> - That is a great idea.<eos> - I know, I know.<eos> I think you're definitely ready for this.
Which you have to go to if you're gonna run for president again.<eos> Huh?<eos> I'm gonna run for president again.<eos> - That is a great idea.<eos> - I know, I know.<eos> I think you're definitely ready for this.<eos> Yeah, I feel so great about this.<eos> - You should.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Are you sure you're ready for this?
Stop it.<eos> - Four, three...<eos> - Just let it happen.<eos> - We're set.<eos> - Stop it!<eos> You're a dick, Dan.<eos> Welcome back to "CBS This Morning."<eos> Joining me now is freshman Congressman Jonah Ryan of New Hampshire, who recently had a close shave with cancer.<eos> - Don't.<eos> - Now, Congressman... you were really on the razor's edge there for a while.
- I didn't see that coming. Did you?<eos> - Eh...<eos> Andrew, can you help me out here with this?<eos> Actually...<eos> Nobody thinks this is a good idea?<eos> Please don't do that.<eos> You can't do this to us.<eos> Catherine, let me just explain something to you, sweetie.<eos> All right?<eos> I really don't care what you think.
You can't do this to us.<eos> Catherine, let me just explain something to you, sweetie.<eos> All right?<eos> I really don't care what you think.<eos> I'm gonna run for president again.<eos> Okay?<eos> Mommy's gonna be president again.<eos> But you said that if any one of us objects that you're not gonna do it.<eos> Yeah, but I didn't expect anybody to object, did I?<eos> This was a test, folks, and you all failed.
- You want a drink?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - Let me get that for you.<eos> - No, I have it.<eos> Great.<eos> So, listen...<eos> I am... gonna be making a speech at Mutual of Omaha on Monday and I was wondering if you wanted to come with me.<eos> Um, ahem, is that the... the same Omaha that's a 20-minute drive from Council Bluffs, Iowa, and the Madison Monroe dinner on Monday night?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Son of a bitch, you're... gonna run for president.
- No, I have it.<eos> Great.<eos> So, listen...<eos> I am... gonna be making a speech at Mutual of Omaha on Monday and I was wondering if you wanted to come with me.<eos> Um, ahem, is that the... the same Omaha that's a 20-minute drive from Council Bluffs, Iowa, and the Madison Monroe dinner on Monday night?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Son of a bitch, you're... gonna run for president.<eos> What if I were, hypothetically?<eos> - Hypothetically? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Ma'am, you can't run for president.
Jesus Christ, you know?<eos> I wanted you to come here because I was wondering if you wanted to join the board of my Meyer Fund for... AIDS and Adult Literacy.<eos> - Be an honor. - Hmm.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Thank you, ma'am.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, maybe if we teach them how to read a condom wrapper, they wouldn't get AIDS in the first place.<eos> Okay. See?<eos> There's hope.<eos> You know, ma'am, you're one of only 46 people who became...
Hello, friend.<eos> Hey, should we add another friend?<eos> Yeah, we should.<eos> How many friends can we conference at the same time?<eos> Well, thanks to the amazing new TURN server, as many as you like.<eos> What if someone is in an area with poor cellular reception?<eos> I doubt it would even work.<eos> And if it did, the lag, the video quality... that would be horrible.<eos> Well, let's find out.<eos> Could you keep your eyes on the road, please?
I am not involved!<eos> Richard, can you hear me?<eos> Okay, for real, Richard. You have to pull over.<eos> - Richard, do not... do not pull over.<eos> - You'll never see him again.<eos> - Hey, are you on the shitter?<eos> - Pull the fuck over.<eos> - Richard!<eos> - Okay. What the fuck?<eos> Are you seriously trying to kidnap me right now? No.
Ordinarily, I loathe coming to China, but when you close a deal like that, it makes the whole trip a delight.<eos> Champagne, gentlemen?<eos> I think that's very much in order.<eos> I know you don't toot your own horn, so I'll do it for you.<eos> Here to you, Jack, and to your Hooli/Endframe box becoming the most successful American data storage appliance to ever be manufactured in China.<eos> Toot, toot.<eos> Watch your back, Jeff Bezos, here comes Hooli.<eos> All right, gentlemen... our flight today from Shanghai to Moffett Field in Mountain View will be just over 11 hours, so if you'll just...<eos> Oh, actually, I was headed up to Jackson Hole, see the wife and kids.<eos> I was gonna charter up tomorrow, but maybe you could ask the boys just to drop me off on the way?
That seems fair.<eos> Seems totally fair to me.<eos> Dad?<eos> Nope.<eos> Not gonna happen.<eos> Mr. Bighetti, with all due respect, I...<eos> If you had any respect, you wouldn't have talked my son into wasting his money... again.<eos> My son's not giving up one share.<eos> Not now, not ever.<eos> Mr. Bighetti, if you're going to control your son's board seat, these decisions have to be unanimous.

Not now, not ever.<eos> Mr. Bighetti, if you're going to control your son's board seat, these decisions have to be unanimous.<eos> You're going to kill this comp...<eos> I don't care.<eos> In my eyes, the company is already dead.<eos> Killed by you.<eos> That's my edge.<eos> If all I accomplish by doing this is making you as miserable as you've made me watching you fleece my son, then I'm okay with that.<eos> He seems okay with that.<eos> So you expect me to give the 40 percent to the gents from my 50 percent, effectively leaving me with 10 percent?
Wait a minute.<eos> Aw, shit.<eos> They kicked us out of this place.<eos> I'm at the wrong fucking school.<eos> Richard, you find that man, fuck him good.<eos> Careful please.<eos> He's gonna peel out.<eos> Monica, I need to...<eos> Oh.<eos> You're not...
We'd have to break ground before monsoon season or else the entire project could collapse.<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> Sorry.<eos> About what?<eos> About the factory.<eos> Ah. The factory.<eos> The factory.<eos> Excuse me for a moment.<eos> - So, what have you got?<eos> - Well, sir, I did as you asked.
No more of that Dornish horse piss!<eos> This is the finest Arbor gold!<eos> Proper wine for proper heroes!<eos> Stand together!<eos> Stand together!<eos> Not you.<eos> I'm not wasting good wine on a damn woman.<eos> Maybe I'm not the most pleasant man.<eos> I'll admit it. But I'm proud of you lot.<eos> You're my family, the men who helped me slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding.
Maybe I'm not the most pleasant man.<eos> I'll admit it. But I'm proud of you lot.<eos> You're my family, the men who helped me slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> Cheer.<eos> Brave men, all of you.<eos> Butchered a woman pregnant with her babe.<eos> Cut the throat of a mother of five.<eos> Slaughtered your guests after inviting them into your home.<eos> But you didn't slaughter every one of the Starks.
It's more valuable to us now than gold.<eos> We need to find it, we need to mine it, we need to make weapons from it.<eos> Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow.<eos> It's about time we taught these boys of summer how to fight.<eos> Not just the boys.<eos> We can't defend the North if only half the population is fighting.<eos> You expect me to put a spear in my granddaughter's hand?<eos> I don't plan on knitting by the fire while men fight for me.<eos> I might be small, Lord Glover, and I might be a girl, but I am every bit as much a Northerner as you.<eos> Indeed you are, my lady.
Thousands of them.<eos> Do you believe me now, Clegane?<eos> Do you believe we're here for a reason?<eos> What the hell are you doing, Clegane?<eos> Burying the dead.<eos> You knew these people.<eos> Not really.<eos> We ask the Father to judge us with mercy. We ask the Mother to...<eos> Fuck it, I don't remember the rest.<eos> I'm sorry you're dead.

I offer vengeance... justice...<eos> Fire and blood.<eos> I traveled south under orders from the Lord Commander.<eos> You ought to be a Maester.<eos> Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men.<eos> It's a map of Dragonstone.<eos> That's dragonglass.<eos> A mountain of it, beneath the ground.<eos> Jon needs to know.<eos> You must send me away.
I command you to heal yourself.<eos> I command you to find the cure.<eos> So why's a nice girl on her own heading to King's Landing?<eos> I'm going to kill the queen.<eos> I invited Euron Greyjoy, the new king of the Iron Islands.<eos> The Iron Fleet is the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen.<eos> The surest way to a woman's heart is with a gift.<eos> I won't return to King's Landing until I have that for you.<eos> Shall we begin?<eos> On a night like this, you came into the world.
Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms.<eos> The lords of Westeros despise her.<eos> Even before your arrival, they plotted against her.<eos> - Now...<eos> - They cry out for their true queen?<eos> They drink secret toasts to my health?<eos> People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them.<eos> If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already.<eos> Conquering Westeros would be easy for you.<eos> But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.
If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already.<eos> Conquering Westeros would be easy for you.<eos> But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.<eos> No.<eos> We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse.<eos> If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won.<eos> With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south.<eos> I never properly thanked you for that.<eos> They joined our side, my queen, because they believe in you.<eos> You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?

You turned against him.

As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them.<eos> I wasn't born into a great house.<eos> I came from nothing.<eos> I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering.<eos> When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses.<eos> You wish to know where my true loyalties lie?<eos> Not with any king or queen, but with the people.<eos> The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule.<eos> The people whose hearts you aim to win.<eos> If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes.
Not with any king or queen, but with the people.<eos> The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule.<eos> The people whose hearts you aim to win.<eos> If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes.<eos> Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me.<eos> But if you let me live, I will serve you well.<eos> I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you.<eos> Because I know the people have no better chance than you.<eos> Swear this to me, Varys.<eos> If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back.

_ _ _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne.<eos> It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?<eos> No, it didn't.<eos> You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.
Not yet, but even those who don't worship the Lord can serve his cause.<eos> What does your lord expect from me?<eos> "The prince who was promised will bring the dawn."<eos> I'm afraid I'm not a prince.<eos> Your Grace, forgive me, but your translation is not quite accurate.<eos> That noun has no gender in High Valyrian, so the proper translation for that prophecy would be,<eos> "The prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn."<eos> Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?<eos> No, but I like it better.<eos> And you believe this prophecy refers to me?
"The prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn."<eos> Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?<eos> No, but I like it better.<eos> And you believe this prophecy refers to me?<eos> Prophecies are dangerous things.<eos> I believe you have a role to play.<eos> As does another... the King in the North, Jon Snow.<eos> Jon Snow?<eos> - Ned Stark's bastard?<eos> - You know him?

What do you think?<eos> Tyrion's not like the other Lannisters.<eos> He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk.<eos> "The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne.<eos> Join us.<eos> Together, we can end her tyranny."<eos> Sounds like a charmer.<eos> Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied, and three dragons... a bit less charming.<eos> What?<eos> Fire kills wights, you told me.

- No, too dangerous.<eos> - But?<eos> But if the Army of the Dead makes it past the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them?<eos> If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she'll destroy the realm as we know it.<eos> Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell.<eos> But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the crown.<eos> With their help, the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores... mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts,<eos> Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought.<eos> This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty.<eos> You all remember the Mad King.
His daughter is no different.<eos> In Essos, her brutality is already legendary.<eos> She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay.<eos> And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons.<eos> It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will.<eos> But I need your help, my lords.<eos> We must stand together, all of us... if we hope to stop her.<eos> She has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace.<eos> The same as Aegon when he conquered the Seven Kingdoms.<eos> How do you propose to stop them?

I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come.<eos> I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help me destroy her enemies.<eos> All her enemies.<eos> Including Olenna Tyrell.<eos> I'm a Tarly.<eos> That name means something.<eos> We're not oathbreakers. We're not schemers.<eos> We don't stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings.<eos> I swore an oath to House Tyrell.<eos> You swore an oath to the crown as well, Lord Tarly.

- No.<eos> - Isn't there some way...<eos> Does this look like a baby to you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Have you studied the varying rates of greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men?<eos> No.<eos> Maester Cressen discovered Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.<eos> This is quite advanced.<eos> And beyond our skills, ser.<eos> Were you a commoner, I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once to live out your life with the stone men.
How you choose to spend that time is up to you.<eos> Come, Samwell.<eos> Should we send word to your family, Ser...?<eos> Jorah.<eos> Jorah Mormont.<eos> Mormont?<eos> There's no need.<eos> I've been dead to them for years.<eos> Come, Samwell!<eos> Have you ever been down here, Your Grace?
The finest artillators and blacksmiths in King's Landing have been laboring day and night, Your Grace.<eos> If you'll kindly pull that lever.<eos> If you want the Iron Throne, take it.<eos> We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons.<eos> We should hit King's Landing now, hard, with everything we have.<eos> The city will fall within a day.<eos> If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms.<eos> It's called war.<eos> You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding.<eos> I know how you wage war.
Of course, I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my granddaughter.<eos> The common people loved her.<eos> The nobles loved her.<eos> And what is left of her now?<eos> Ashes.<eos> Commoners, nobles, they're all just children, really.<eos> They won't obey you unless they fear you.<eos> I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your counsel.<eos> I'm grateful to all of you.<eos> But you have chosen to follow me.

If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point.<eos> Our army should be Westerosi.<eos> And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?<eos> You are.<eos> Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear.<eos> And her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing.<eos> The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army.<eos> Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.<eos> So, your master plan is to use our armies.<eos> Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?
Or his?<eos> Peace never lasts, my dear.<eos> Will you take a bit of advice from an old woman?<eos> He's a clever man, your Hand.<eos> I've known a great many clever men.<eos> I've outlived them all.<eos> You know why?<eos> I ignored them.<eos> The lords of Westeros are sheep.<eos> Are you a sheep?

There are two recorded cases of advanced greyscale being cured.<eos> I found the procedure in the study of rare diseases by Archmaester Pylos.<eos> I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos and his study of rare diseases.<eos> - Oh, you are?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And shall I tell you how he died?<eos> From greyscale.<eos> - Oh. - The procedure's far too dangerous, which is why it's now forbidden.<eos> Hello.<eos> What are you doing?

A Targaryen cannot be trusted.<eos> - Nor can a Lannister.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Aye.<eos> We called your brother king.<eos> And then he rode south and lost his kingdom.<eos> Winter is here, Your Grace.<eos> We need the King in the North in the North.<eos> Aye!<eos> You all crowned me your king.
I delivered his bones myself.<eos> Presented them to Lady Catelyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister.<eos> Seems like a lifetime ago.<eos> Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.<eos> I was sorry when he died.<eos> Your father and I had our differences, but he loved Cat very much.<eos> So did I.<eos> She wasn't fond of you, was she?<eos> Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you.<eos> Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand, King in the North.
I want the Mountain.<eos> The Mountain killed Father.<eos> He'll crush you with one hand.<eos> Father got careless. That's what Mama says.<eos> Will you shut up about Mama?<eos> "Mama, Mama, Mama."<eos> Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing.<eos> And then I won't have to share.<eos> "Mama!"<eos> How can you drink this piss?
What if we had some hip youngsters in here, you know?<eos> We could, like, talk about viral videos or, like, fashion trends or, like, totally be kept up with the Kardashians, which I've been wanting to get kept up on.<eos> All I'm saying is, we should be the ones running the train... trainee... trainee's... oh, I've never seen that word before.<eos> That is a weird word.<eos> New Employees Bagel Bash.<eos> Here's me at mine.<eos> Okay, thank you, Bill.<eos> We will take it from here, all right?<eos> Hey, my name is Adam, the top sales dog, or at least pretty high up there, DeMamp, and these are my associates.<eos> Howdy, I'm Blake, and you are probably thinking,
Yikes.<eos> Four, four, a couple fours.<eos> Oh, I like these three right there with the twos.<eos> Yes, and yes.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Sit your ass down.<eos> Because you have a three as your first letter in your number.<eos> - Ew, 35? - Mm-mm.<eos> Yeah, that's really bad.<eos> Okay, so if my friend Adam here pointed to you, why don't you come on up, tell us a little bit about yourself, what makes you tick.
I'm sorry.<eos> - You are fired.<eos> - Yeah, we're good.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> - This way.<eos> - Yep.<eos> This is blatant ageism.<eos> You might be too old to understand what we were saying.
Hey, Blake and Anders, it's Adam, and I'm doing what you guys just explained that we're doing.<eos> - Right.<eos> - So shut up, Mom.<eos> I'm talking to my friends, okay?<eos> Oh, so you are talking to somebody.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Shut up.<eos> - No, you shut up.<eos> You're... you're a disrespectful bitch, okay?<eos> You also get long-distance calls.
But seriously, guys, nothing like a hot-roof beer after pulling a cold-blooded prank.<eos> [laughter] It was cold-blooded.<eos> It is the absolute best.<eos> Oh, Jesus, dude.<eos> That is super hot.<eos> It's like soup.<eos> Yeah, well, they've been on the roof for a week, so...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - It's still good.<eos> Guys, I'd like to propose a toast, if you don't mind.
You did what you said.<eos> - I got it.<eos> It's waggling.<eos> - You touched it.<eos> Ohh, 69 Man, you 69 last night?<eos> Oh, yeah, I did.<eos> That's really awesome.<eos> - Wow. - Yeah, dude.<eos> Morning, legends.<eos> You're just in time.
- What? - Whoo-hoo!<eos> Yeah, no, dude, I'm gonna live forever. Whoo-hoo! [together] Ohh!<eos> And that's what's up.<eos> And that's what's up.<eos> Yeah, no, I think I pulled something.<eos> Hey, man, I don't know if you guys would want to [bleep] With this, but we had an idea for a pretty cool thing to use the office for, but...<eos> ah, you know what?<eos> It's probably too savage for you guys.<eos> What?<eos> No, are you... did you not just see what he did?
It's probably too savage for you guys.<eos> What?<eos> No, are you... did you not just see what he did?<eos> - Yeah, my boy's a savage.<eos> - That was insane.<eos> We're in.<eos> We're loco.<eos> We're down to clown.<eos> We want to shoot a porno in the office.<eos> You want to... and you... and you actually... you have the...
Yo, even Alice has a side hustle.<eos> She teaches yoga on the weekends.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - That's tight.<eos> She does.<eos> - That's cool.<eos> - Slammin' body.<eos> Anyway, we think the cubicle would be a dope location.<eos> It's gonna be a really special film, super talented group of sex workers.<eos> Yeah, we just need help handing out the snacks, so... these actors get pretty hungry, if you know what I mean.
Why are you here<eos> I'm teaching a yoga class, Anders.<eos> It's my side hustle.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - Yeah, we got those too.<eos> [penis pump squeaking] Okay, what the hell is that noise?<eos> It's for my sleep apnea.<eos> I snore a lot, and then this kind of just... [snoring] You know what?<eos> When you guys started here seven years ago, this was all kind of cute, but you know what?<eos> You're old as [bleep] now.
We've seen how y'all prank.<eos> We're gonna handle the pranking.<eos> We got this.<eos> Okay, wow.<eos> Okay, you're in charge.<eos> Please let us know if we can assist you, Your Highness.<eos> Seriously, though, if we could just help, we're pretty bored and have nothing to do.<eos> Sup?<eos> You guys have a good week off?<eos> You chill, hit the ol' internal rest button?
Sup?<eos> You guys have a good week off?<eos> You chill, hit the ol' internal rest button?<eos> Yeah, no, it was very chill.<eos> A week with no pay.<eos> I didn't even get to visit the ice cream truck.<eos> Wait, you guys... you guys aren't pissed, are you?<eos> You know, it's just that we don't usually involve Alice in pranks is all, so, you know.<eos> You guys inspired us.<eos> You're our heroes.
Right, right, but, like, the oldest of the young dogs.<eos> Yeah, no, I get that.<eos> You know, we're still pups on the porch, even though we like to run around in the yard.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - But since we're all pups here, I've got to tell you that everyone in this office wants to fi-ight you, and they're planning a prank... clap back.<eos> - Yep.<eos> - But the thing is, is, we really li-ike you.<eos> And we don't want to fi-ight you.<eos> We li-ike you too.<eos> So if you let us QB this prank, new school and newer school working together...
That's on us, okay?<eos> You guys should get out of here.<eos> You got your whole lives ahead of you, right?<eos> So just run.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Because sometimes clap backs clap back.<eos> I mean, this is on us.<eos> We appreciate everything you taught us, old dog.<eos> I'm not an old... okay, I'm not old, though.<eos> Yo, man, you all guys are heroes, man.

- Wow, I'm impressed.<eos> You feel like you've lost some weight.<eos> Good acting.<eos> That was really good stuff.<eos> You guys are officially the JV main office pranksters.<eos> - Seriously.<eos> - Hey, how are we the JV?<eos> That was my idea.<eos> Well, you guys are like the nerd losers of the office; we're cool.<eos> You weren't in charge.
Dealer busts.<eos> All right.<eos> You know, a friend once told me that those,<eos> "everyone gets quiet at the same time" moments only happens at 22, 20 past the hour.<eos> Now, I'll be damned why that happens.<eos> Ghosts flying overhead, but, check this out.<eos> 20 past.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Those four quarters you just loaded.
Don't do it.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Those four quarters you just loaded.<eos> This is not '80s Vegas.<eos> They won't just break your hands and let you walk away.<eos> They'll prosecute and push for maximum sentence.<eos> There's a camera there, camera there, over there.<eos> That old lady in the Terrapins sweatshirt behind you is not a grandma.<eos> Dealer shows 16, sir.<eos> They started upgrades from single table eye six weeks ago when insurance flagged what you must have.
Yeah, he knows. I tried to fuck him on your grave.<eos> Seemed only fair.<eos> Yeah, that does seem fair.<eos> I'm not proud of myself.<eos> I, I had Robbie buried with his penis, you know, that you...<eos> I was vulgar.<eos> I'm a vulgar woman.<eos> Anger and grief have... have really just made me vulgar.<eos> I...<eos> Laura, I found out that you and Robbie were dead and having an affair in the same sentence.
Maybe just one.<eos> Your boss doesn't seem to have an I.D., record, somehow even a name.<eos> You got all those, Mr. Moon, record especially.<eos> Lawyer.<eos> Didn't catch that.<eos> You're probably asking yourself about now how it came to pass that two country-fried police even found you at that motel for a crime committed over... count 'em... Two state lines.<eos> It's a good story.<eos> Just ask.<eos> Lawyer, please.<eos> Hmm. I thought maybe you were gonna say something different.

She's a tenant of the room.<eos> He's the ruffian on the stair.<eos> Look, I get it.<eos> You're a week out of jail.<eos> You meet some old grifter, seems to know his way around.<eos> Guy offers a job, a chance to learn.<eos> But I think this boss of yours pissed off some big-time bombers.<eos> And whether you realize it or not, you're about to get hit by the shrapnel.<eos> Lawyer.<eos> Ah. What were you doing in Chicago?

You have my attention.<eos> Now, the leprechaun, h-he's been against all this from the get-go, but he's at a disadvantage being as he is a fucking idiot.<eos> Now, Nancy, he comes at all of this from a specific vantage of the bitterly dispossessed, which normally I would take with a grain, but I have to admit, having seen the rope burns around my friend's neck...<eos> So imagine:<eos> two rural police, middle of wild turkey season, and the same company whose tech found Osama, is dropping two no-name grifters in our lap.<eos> You two have very extravagant enemies.<eos> Lawyer?<eos> What's the ask?<eos> Oh, you got me curious.<eos> I'd like to know what you know.
Hands up!<eos> She ain't dead!<eos> She ain't dead.<eos> See?<eos> Oh, you're an asshole.<eos> You're a fucking asshole, dead wife.<eos> You're a fucking asshole, dead wife!<eos> You're an asshole, dead wife!<eos> He's loyal.<eos> So you two talk about whatever you need to talk about.
No more stolen scraps, shortchanging, hand-to-mouth, gray hairs.<eos> No more motels and byways.<eos> A place in tomorrow... Current, lasting.<eos> Valhalla anew.<eos> Doesn't that sound swell?<eos> An oyster.<eos> Inside every pearl there's a single irritating grain of sand.<eos> That's me.<eos> Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.<eos> Just like an oyster, you're trying to cover me up with something smooth and shiny... Pretty on a necklace, but inside the shell, that slimy thing just wants that scratchy thing out of there.

That's all you do, occupy their time.<eos> We gave back.<eos> We gave them meaning.<eos> Then give it to them again.<eos> You're leaving?<eos> On a good line.<eos> It was a good line.<eos> He's here.<eos> You have him.<eos> You're letting him go.

Coffee, please.<eos> Black.<eos> I'll bring it to your table.<eos> Find a dark corner downwind.<eos> Are you trying to shame me?<eos> That shit will blow up in your face.<eos> Shame is the reason dead people only go out at night.<eos> I have no use for shame.<eos> Shame, I Dream of Genie, is what kept you from gettin' tossed off a roof long enough to make it to America.<eos> And what do you know about dead people?
I don't know.<eos> I really like anal sex.<eos> It's an old hanging tree.<eos> You like it?<eos> No.<eos> - Evening.<eos> - Evening.<eos> Betty's getting a spit polish.<eos> Stay as long as you like.<eos> You'll be safe here.
I've got it.<eos> Go on.<eos> Ibis and Jacquel.<eos> Mm-hmm. Two females?<eos> In the days when you could be hanged in a London prison for the theft of 12 pennies, the Americas became a symbol of clemency.<eos> Transportation, it was called.<eos> For five years, for 10 years, for life, you were sold to a captain and would ride his ship crowded tight as a slaver's.<eos> Off the ship you were sold as an indentured servant to the one who would take the cost of your skin out in your labor.<eos> But at least you were not waiting to hang in an English prison.<eos> And when your years of indenture were complete, you were free to make the best of your new world.
They're merry folk, and full of music.<eos> Oh, except for the leprechauns.<eos> Oh, the leprechauns.<eos> They are so busy guarding their gold that they've no time for anything else at all.<eos> Why do we leave them a gift?<eos> Because we want their blessings, so we better.<eos> And when she was no longer a young girl, curved and billowed like the swell of the green sea, it was she who kept alive the old practice, and she who told the tales.<eos> We leave a meal for the fair folk if we want their blessings.<eos> We don't skimp, neither.<eos> The cream from the milk, the softest crumb you've got at hand.
And that's when I heard it:<eos> Boom! Like a hammer.<eos> "Who goes there?", I ask.<eos> No answer.<eos> I think about turning back, then my curiosity gets the better of me.<eos> So I go towards it, only the closer I get, the farther away it goes.<eos> Finally, I turned around and I'd wandered so far into the moors, that I can't find me way back.<eos> Three hours, I wandered in the dark, and not a thing familiar, but then I remembered what me gran told me about the leprechaun.<eos> So, I swallow my hunger and I take my bread, and I put it down on a mossy stone, and I lay down to sleep beside it.<eos> And then you'll never believe it:
Go find your man.<eos> Your God, your jinn.<eos> You are an unpleasant creature.<eos> Hello?<eos> Can I, uh, help you with something, Ma'am?<eos> Yes, I've always wanted to steal a car.<eos> So I'm gonna steal yours.<eos> Uh, well, it's not mine, it's my boss's.<eos> Okay, well, then, I'm stealing his.<eos> I don't know how much is here, but you take that, you tell your boss that you were robbed, which you have been.

I can hear a voice hadn't had its fill of screaming.<eos> Well, I most definitely do not belong here.<eos> I was just at the pub for a cup of ale.<eos> Good lad.<eos> I was even gonna pay for it, when some flange cuts in front of me like fucking King fucking George.<eos> So I give him a good chock, just a warning.<eos> And he topples head first into a broken bottle.<eos> Lost the eye, they tell me.<eos> Plenty of flanges do well with just one.<eos> What of you, Miss, you take an eye?
I'm past that hope.<eos> I had my opportunity.<eos> Doesn't seem right, just giving you the one.<eos> Well, the world don't operate on right.<eos> That it doesn't.<eos> To hell with them and their gallows.<eos> Give them a good, long piss as you dangle.<eos> Make a mess for them to mop after.<eos> So long as you don't go easy.<eos> So, you sailed the boat prior, then?
I saw.<eos> I knew I would die that day if I stayed.<eos> Put on my boots, and dropped my sword, and I flew.<eos> I owe a battle.<eos> You're following Wednesday so that you can fight in his war and die, and for that, you run his errands?<eos> I done worse than that.<eos> Dying worked for me.<eos> Everyone should try it at least once.<eos> Seems like you've walked the earth a couple hundred years in those boots already, so, you're due.<eos> The night of Samhain, the spirits can spill freely into our world, but if you wear a disguise, like that, then they'll take you for one of their own.

That I am.<eos> - A man of the mounds. - Oh.<eos> Or rather, that I was.<eos> But now I'm here, in this new world, where nobody puts out ale or milk for an honest fellow.<eos> Or a loaf of bread come harvest time.<eos> If you are who I think you are, I have no quarrel with you.<eos> Nor I with you.<eos> Although it was you that brought me here, you and a few others like you.<eos> Into this land with no time for magic, no place for faeries and such folk.<eos> I... you have done me many a good turn.

Okay?<eos> I just wanted to come here, and tell you that I love you.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> All righty then.<eos> This has been so fun.<eos> Bye.<eos> Selina.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> Mayor, this... is Ms. Hearst.<eos> Perhaps you've truly found your calling in office, Mr. Cobblepot.

Nothing!<eos> But there was someone who understood.<eos> Someone who spoke out, who stood up, to the jailers, puppets.<eos> A man with no fear.<eos> Hello, Gotham City!<eos> We're the Maniax.<eos> And I'm Jerome, the shot caller of our little gang.<eos> We're here to spread the message of wisdom and hope.<eos> Some people have no manners.<eos> You're all prisoners.

Some people have no manners.<eos> You're all prisoners.<eos> What you call sanity, it's just a prison in your minds that stops you from seeing you're just tiny little cogs in a giant, absurd machine,<eos> Wake up!<eos> Oh!<eos> Time to go.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> We'll be back very soon.<eos> Hang onto your hats, folks.<eos> 'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet!
He and all the other human garbage that plague this city.<eos> All will be tried, convicted and executed!<eos> I will purge Gotham, and the innocents will thank me!<eos> Their savior!<eos> Their executioner.<eos> I know, and the best part is, that fake painting is still hanging in the gallery.<eos> Perhaps we might be able to talk about something other than your previous illicit exploits, Ms. Kyle.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, Alfred.<eos> This was a great meal.<eos> You're quite the chef.
I see what you mean, though.<eos> Oh, well, that's just...<eos> Just hilarious.<eos> You know...<eos> Really. Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much...<eos> Oh, I guess I better go.<eos> It's late. Stay.<eos> Alfred will drive you to your hotel in the morning.<eos> You're very kind.
Yeah, but...<eos> The birthday boy.<eos> Your Honor.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Why?<eos> Why would you do such a thing?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What is that?<eos> You are a sick man!<eos> What are you plotting?
Why?<eos> Why would you do such a thing?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What is that?<eos> You are a sick man!<eos> What are you plotting?<eos> What's the angle?<eos> Who are you in on this with?<eos> I-I have no idea.<eos> Look, you're exhausted.

You still love James Gordon.<eos> Where is he?<eos> We're minutes away.<eos> They're looking for him.<eos> Well, look harder.<eos> Here he is!<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> Mayor stuff.<eos> Mr. Mayor, this is a pin...<eos> I hope you're ready, Mr. Mayor.
Don't listen to him, Jim.<eos> Shoot him now!<eos> Relax, Zsasz.<eos> Job's cancelled.<eos> You can go home.<eos> Okay, boss.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> If it was up to me, you'd be dead.<eos> Whew!<eos> So from humble errand boy to kitchen worker to the so-called "King of Gotham," it is said that many died so you could rise.
Whew!<eos> So from humble errand boy to kitchen worker to the so-called "King of Gotham," it is said that many died so you could rise.<eos> Oh...<eos> An exaggeration.<eos> People love to invent scandal.<eos> But it was murder that sent you to Arkham, a prison for the criminally insane.<eos> I rescued the city from the madman, Theo Galavan.<eos> Some call it murder.<eos> Others a public service.<eos> And after your controversial release from prison, you met your father,
A man whose identity your mother kept from you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Yes, it must have been very upsetting.<eos> What?<eos> Yes.<eos> He also died under suspicious circumstances.<eos> His wife and step-children disappearing soon after.<eos> I-I have to go.<eos> Why?<eos> Is it because there's substance to the rumors that you had them killed to inherit your father's wealth?

To hell with the people!<eos> Father, wait!<eos> Father?<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> A very good job.<eos> Ah.<eos> He bought it?<eos> Hook, line and sinker.<eos> Ah, voice wasn't quite right, but, uh, you know...
Father?<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> A very good job.<eos> Ah.<eos> He bought it?<eos> Hook, line and sinker.<eos> Ah, voice wasn't quite right, but, uh, you know...<eos> Bravo, boys.<eos> Penguin lost his mind on national TV, just like you said he would.
Previously on Gotham...<eos> I demand that you arrest Detective Gordon for the murder of my husband.
I'm your daughter.<eos> First, we take away his mind.<eos> And then when this bird is broken...<eos> Who are you in on this with?<eos> !<eos> you can put him out of his misery.<eos> Guess where Dwight Pollard worked before the morgue.<eos> Indian Hill.<eos> It's time to get him.<eos> What you call sanity, it's just a prison in your minds.

- Lucius.<eos> If you wanted to bring back someone from one of these, what would be your next step?<eos> Thawing 'em out.<eos> You'd have to get the body to core temperature before even attempting reanimation.<eos> I worked on the design of these when I was at Wayne.<eos> Oh, good job.<eos> Thanks for helping the bad guys.<eos> How long?<eos> If we're lucky, three hours.<eos> GCPD. You're under arrest.
Thanks for helping the bad guys.<eos> How long?<eos> If we're lucky, three hours.<eos> GCPD. You're under arrest.<eos> He needs a hospital.<eos> No.<eos> Appreciate you boys seeing me so late.<eos> Doesn't seem like we had much of a choice, Mr. Clemens, does it?<eos> Please, call me Cole.<eos> You want money.
She said she'd do something.<eos> She didn't.<eos> Ergo, she owes me the money I would've made,<eos> - plus interest.<eos> - Or what?<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> I would never hurt a woman.<eos> However,<eos> I would feel justified in giving the police enough evidence so that your little girlfriend could only talk to her mama every other Thursday through a screen for the next 40 years.<eos> So, you give Maria the money, she gives it to me...
Bending the rules, what a surprise.<eos> It's Jerome Valeska we're talking about.<eos> You remember what he's done.<eos> There's always a reason.<eos> He needs to go to a hospital.<eos> Lee...<eos> I know you had Falcone call off Zsasz.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You want to thank me?<eos> When you find Dwight, you have him bring back Mario from the dead, how 'bout that?
The James Gordon.<eos> Wow.<eos> It's actually you.<eos> So cool I'm meeting you.<eos> You should thank your friends.<eos> They're the ones who left you behind.<eos> Eh, I'd have done the same.<eos> Tell me where he took Jerome.<eos> Why?<eos> You can't stop it.
They're the ones who left you behind.<eos> Eh, I'd have done the same.<eos> Tell me where he took Jerome.<eos> Why?<eos> You can't stop it.<eos> Stop what?<eos> Um... the night of the awakening.<eos> You mean waking up Jerome?<eos> Jerome is just the first step.<eos> You think we're a small band.
Go, now.<eos> We're almost done loading the vans.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> Ding... dong...<eos> And we are... there.<eos> I hope you had a nice sleep.<eos> 'Cause we got a busy, busy day ahead.<eos> Hmm?<eos> Well, hang on to your hats, folks!<eos> 'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet.
I'm thinking that son of a bitch we found at the break-in could have been telling the truth.<eos> What, that they're everywhere?<eos> Huh?<eos> That Jerome's got thousands of disciples waiting for him to wake up?<eos> Come on.<eos> - This is 50 wackadoos, tops.<eos> - Maybe.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> I think I got something.<eos> You asked what Dwight would need to revive Jerome.
Each of you kept him alive.<eos> Each of you is Jerome.<eos> I am Jerome.<eos> We are all...<eos> Jerome.<eos> I'm Jerome.<eos> I'm Jerome.<eos> - I'm Jerome.<eos> - I'm Jerome.<eos> You are Jerome.
Harvey, no!<eos> No.<eos> 25 milligrams of sodium pentothal.<eos> Give him a few minutes, he'll tell you what you need to know.<eos> Damn.<eos> Lee...<eos> - Lee, stop.<eos> - Don't touch me.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> You wanted Dove to talk, so now he'll talk.
Dwight's heading to Channel 9 to make some sort of announcement on the 6:00 news.<eos> All right, call the station.<eos> - Have them evacuate...<eos> - I'm already on it.<eos> Let's go!<eos> The GCPD has asked us to evacuate the building.<eos> They assure me that everything is under control.<eos> No one's going anywhere.<eos> We've got a show to do, people.<eos> And, as you know, the show must go on.
They assure me that everything is under control.<eos> No one's going anywhere.<eos> We've got a show to do, people.<eos> And, as you know, the show must go on.<eos> What the...<eos> Boo.<eos> Ha, ha, ha...<eos> Wow.<eos> Well, that is quite a story.<eos> You know, I know I've been dead, but doesn't that seem kind of crazy to you?
The Channel 9 news station seems to have had a hostage situation.<eos> Uh, we're not sure how many hostages...<eos> It's all here?<eos> 200 grand.<eos> We did it, baby.<eos> Come on, let's just get out of this town.<eos> Hey, smile.<eos> We won.<eos> Yeah, smile.<eos> You won.

What were my options, Selina?<eos> If I didn't give her the money, she would've skipped town.<eos> So, you thought you'd pay her.<eos> Have her stick around, maybe get used to being my mom.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Yes.<eos> - You lied to me.<eos> - I didn't tell you the truth.<eos> - It's the same thing. - Perhaps, but telling you your mother was a con artist who'd only sought you out for the purposes of getting money from me... didn't seem like a very attractive alternative.<eos> You... and her... you both lied to me.
Can you hear me?<eos> Ah, screw it.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Hi.<eos> Some of you may know, I died.<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> But take it from me, death is... dull... but coming back... that is something.<eos> Leave it to dying to give you a whole new perspective on life.<eos> And I would like to share that with you.<eos> Uh, Officer, you look terrible.
How's triage going?<eos> We have a lot of overflow from Gotham General.<eos> What do you want?<eos> When Jerome woke up, did he say anything?<eos> Just that he wanted his face back.<eos> No. I mean, anything that might indicate where he was going, what he was planning.<eos> We were just playing catch-up.<eos> You know, about coming back to life, the cult.<eos> He asked if you and I were still together.<eos> I mentioned you killed my husband on our wedding night, and he thought that was hilarious, so that's something the two of you can bond over when you find him.
You-you look familiar.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm... I happen to be the mayor of Gotham.<eos> So free me, and I promise there will be a handsome reward.<eos> Oh, it-it really is you, the mayor of Gotham in the flesh.<eos> Yes!<eos> Now stop standing there and get me out of here.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't know.<eos> What did you do?
Gabe!<eos> We have to find Ed Nygma and kill him!<eos> Gabe, where...<eos> Your monkey's cleared out.<eos> And what's that you were saying about Nygma?<eos> Looks like we're not the only ones trying to kill that guy.<eos> Now, where is he?<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> Speak up.<eos> What are you doing in my house?
That was awful, wasn't it?<eos> Her crying, bleeding out.<eos> You just holding her as she died.<eos> You never did anything about it.<eos> Yet.<eos> Nah.<eos> You had your chance to kill me.<eos> Stop turning us against each other.<eos> We're taking him with us.<eos> Oh, if you think I am going anywhere with you...
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom...<eos> All right.<eos> What's next?<eos> Death by a thousand cuts, very poetic.<eos> I like that.<eos> Slice!<eos> Nailed it.<eos> All right, folks.<eos> This is very important.<eos> Whatever you do, please, definitely try this at home.
This is very important.<eos> Whatever you do, please, definitely try this at home.<eos> Preferably on a family member.<eos> Giddyup.<eos> Whoo, doggie!<eos> You ready, partner?<eos> Oh, good Lord.<eos> Strike force just arrived.<eos> They're coming in.<eos> Detective Gordon, you're just in time for the big finish.
Nobody move!<eos> Find him.<eos> I'll find Jerome.<eos> So... here we are.<eos> I suppose I underestimated you, Barbara.<eos> It's the curse of great beauty.<eos> How did it go?<eos> You put together what happened to Ed's librarian, turned him against me.<eos> Honestly, wasn't too hard.<eos> And then, together, you hatched a plan to destroy everything I made and kill me?
I wanted you to follow me.<eos> You're going to pay for what you've done.<eos> You're going to call Ed, tell him you're alive, tell him...<eos> Oh, I don't care.<eos> But find out where he is.<eos> - Why don't you call him?<eos> - Because he's not stupid.<eos> He knows that now you're no longer the head of the underworld or anything else, we don't need him anymore.<eos> It is our time to rule.<eos> You understand if I feel compelled to refuse?
Ed.<eos> I won't let you hurt him!<eos> So you'd rather die than give up the man who tried to kill you?<eos> I would!<eos> Isn't that crazy?<eos> Yes.<eos> It is.<eos> Guess you're not as smart as you thought you were.<eos> He didn't give you up after all.<eos> You're in this together.
- Probably.<eos> At least you get to say you punched a man's face off.<eos> That's something, right?<eos> Jim?<eos> Sorry, what?<eos> Come on.<eos> Let me buy you breakfast.<eos> Well, got to say... the clown makeup was way more terrifying than the damage underneath, Master Bruce.<eos> Did I ever tell you that I don't like clowns?<eos> Well... in a couple of days, you'll be back to your old self.

I thought they were going to kill you.<eos> Shall I tell you what I thought?<eos> I thought how proud I was of you.<eos> Of the man that you've become.

It felt like justice.<eos> There's a very fine line, Master Bruce, between justice... and vengeance.<eos> I know.<eos> But that doesn't mean there isn't one.<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> I knew where the line was tonight, Alfred.<eos> I didn't cross it.<eos> Well, that's the first rule.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, I started training you so you could defend yourself.
I didn't cross it.<eos> Well, that's the first rule.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, I started training you so you could defend yourself.<eos> Well, we're well past that, aren't we?<eos> But what's all this training for?<eos> What are you gonna do with it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Nor do I.<eos> But if you keep going, you're gonna need rules.
Just as I need you.<eos> You killed Isabella.<eos> I loved her, Oswald.<eos> Greetings, Professor.<eos> Oh!<eos> Somebody help!<eos> The building's empty.<eos> No one's coming to help.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Wh-Who are you?
!<eos> What?<eos> It's a riddle.<eos> Answer the riddle!<eos> Uh...<eos> I...<eos> Knowledge?<eos> Knowledge can't be shared, Professor?<eos> Really?<eos> You are the chair of a chemistry department.
- What am I?<eos> - I...<eos> Uh...<eos> A shadow?<eos> The answer is an individual.<eos> Duh!<eos> I expected more.<eos> But then, none of the others did very well either.<eos> - The others?<eos> - Oh, you'd know them.
Duh!<eos> I expected more.<eos> But then, none of the others did very well either.<eos> - The others?<eos> - Oh, you'd know them.<eos> One was an artist, one was a writer,<eos> one was a philosopher.<eos> The stars of Gotham's intellectual and artistic... constellation.<eos> Fallen stars now.<eos> Wh-Why are you doing this?
He shot them both, and I did...<eos> I did nothing.<eos> Excellent, my dear.<eos> You truly are Bruce Wayne.<eos> Yes?<eos> We're ready.<eos> Then proceed.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> And on your end, I hope your nephew is amenable.<eos> Should he refuse, you know what must happen.
- The greatest villains have always been defined by the men that try to stop them!<eos> And I know the perfect man.<eos> Please, do not say...<eos> Jim Gordon.<eos> A serial killer of smart people?<eos> In the last few weeks, six members of Gotham's intellectual and artistic elite have killed themselves or died in strange accidents?<eos> Last night, an old professor of mine died in a lab fire.<eos> At a certain point, coincidence becomes pattern.<eos> You getting bored down in the lab, Lucius?<eos> Yes, but that is not why you should look at this.
Just like chopping down a branch.<eos> Like, so.<eos> Easy as pie.<eos> Right, so, weight on the back foot.<eos> Blade comes back evenly.<eos> - Shh. - And...<eos> What?<eos> Precision under pressure is everything, Master Bruce.<eos> And a clear conscience.<eos> Were you aiming for the window, Master Bruce?

Hopefully, something will kick up.<eos> Or else we can sit around and wait for him to send us more singing fruit.<eos> Maybe he has sent us a clue.<eos> Oh.<eos> - Oh, oh, oh.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> You're late.<eos> I expected this call seven minutes ago.<eos> This is Lucius Fox of the GCPD.<eos> I know who you are, Mr. Fox.

Then tell me why you killed Professor Dyson and the others.<eos> - I know it was you.<eos> - I had no choice.<eos> They failed my test.<eos> Now it's your turn to try.<eos> And if I don't accept the invitation?<eos> There are lives at stake, Mr. Fox.<eos> Not just your own.<eos> Now, listen closely.<eos> Tomorrow, when the pawn's on queen, you'll find my next target in the belly of the beast.

Is that so?<eos> The Court doesn't mean you any harm.<eos> They have the highest regard for you.<eos> In fact, they want you to become a member.<eos> Peters, we got a tip from a guy who electrocuted a bunch of players at a fancy chess tournament, pointing us to a pawn on queens.<eos> Now, here, you work at a pawn shop on Queens Avenue.<eos> Coincidence?<eos> So?<eos> I don't know nothing about that.<eos> Why are you so close to me?
I wasn't even supposed to work today.<eos> I was covering for Teddy Thirio, the owner's cousin.<eos> Thirio?<eos> That's the Greek word for beast.<eos> You know, sometimes I think you just make that stuff up.<eos> Come on.<eos> What are you making?<eos> - Shepherd's pie.<eos> - Again?<eos> Well, you're more than welcome to take over the menu, Master Bruce.
He made you!<eos> There is no Ed Nygma without the Penguin!<eos> Meet Ted Thirio...<eos> came in about an hour ago.<eos> Cause of death seems to be blunt force trauma to the head.<eos> However, Mr. Thirio also has a long incision along the right side of his abdomen that's been crudely stapled shut.<eos> The Chess Killer promised a clue inside the belly of the beast.<eos> Think there might be something in his stomach?<eos> Okay.<eos> You worked at Arkham Asylum.
"Who am I?"<eos> Although most people try to answer the question in a logical fashion, while... others...<eos> Hmm.<eos> Stuff Harvey Bullock's badge inside a dead body.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Means I know who the next target is.<eos> - Thank you, Doctor. - Uh...<eos> Thank you, Doctor.<eos> Sorry. I know. Thank you.<eos> "As you take the badge today, approach Gotham as you would... "a cut of prime rib.
Staying down there, boy, big boy?<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, he's up.<eos> Big boy.<eos> Hello, cadets.<eos> My name is Edward Nygma.<eos> Captain Bullock's... tied up.<eos> What a day.<eos> Eh?<eos> You all look just dandy in your uniforms.
- Why should I trust you?<eos> Why should I believe you?<eos> Because we're family?<eos> You have to believe in something.<eos> And while all the cadets survived the attack, police say the culprit, former mayoral chief of staff Edward Nygma, remains at large.<eos> Be on the lookout for a green suit.<eos> - That's right...<eos> - Good evening, Alfred.<eos> And to you, Master Bruce.<eos> Well, you seem remarkably chipper.

We're clear.<eos> Captain, all clear.<eos> I know.<eos> He's not here.<eos> Hello, Foxy.<eos> So, the antidote around Bullock's neck, that turned out to be grape juice.<eos> And the deadly toxin: plain old knockout gas.<eos> Why the charade?<eos> Well, the point wasn't to kill a bunch of cops.<eos> The point was to have you play my game.
One cannot deny love.<eos> I... don't... love you.<eos> Look who's alive.<eos> I just remembered.<eos> There's someone I need to kill.<eos> - The clone is in place.<eos> - What about Bruce Wayne?<eos> Heshouldbe waking up as we speak.<eos> I've always done whatever the Court has asked of me.<eos> What aren't you telling me?
But that's exactly what I'm going to find out.<eos> - I can help.<eos> - No. The Court knows I reached out to you, but that's all.<eos> We need to keep it that way, in case I'm discovered.<eos> Be careful, Uncle Frank.<eos> I'm sorry, I didn't mean to intrude.<eos> I saw you earlier.<eos> Who was that man you were with?<eos> My Uncle Frank.<eos> I thought you two were estranged.
Smart girl.<eos> Shall we begin?<eos> The temple is some sort of maze, is that it?<eos> Everything is a maze, Bruce.<eos> The only difference is whether we realize our place within it.<eos> Given enough time, I will find a way out.<eos> How much time?<eos> How long have you been blindly running down the corridors of your life only to end up in the same place?<eos> It's time to pick a direction.<eos> You can speak in cryptic riddles all you want.
So you had him killed?<eos> Your own brother?<eos> You want to shoot me, Jim?<eos> You'd be doing me a favor.<eos> But it won't change anything.<eos> The only thing we can do now is finish what Peter started and bring down the Court.<eos> It's what he would have wanted.<eos> What my father would have wanted is for justice to be done.<eos> So do I.<eos> Frank Gordon, you're under arrest for the murder of Peter Gordon.

I thought the acting was fine, the music was lovely.<eos> What about you, Bruce?<eos> Sorry, Mom, I agree with Dad.<eos> It was kinda lame.<eos> "Kinda lame"?<eos> There's no such word as "kinda."<eos> Dad?<eos> Mom?<eos> Give me your money!<eos> How'd you... how'd you do that?

What was that place?<eos> - A memory.<eos> - No.<eos> No, it was real.<eos> The mind can do far more than recall memories.<eos> If one knows how, you can experience them, relive them as if they were happening for the first time.<eos> You're saying we were inside my mind?<eos> One is always inside their own mind.<eos> Pretending we are separate from it, that is the falsehood.<eos> Why would you show me that?
Rest.<eos> We'll try again soon.<eos> Torture is fun.<eos> However, I need to know what is coming into dock 9C.<eos> I told you, there is no dock 9C.<eos> - I can't tell you what I don't...<eos> - What you don't know.<eos> Yes, I've heard that one.<eos> Now tell me something I haven't heard.<eos> You don't know what they're capable of.
Please! Please. I'm sorry.<eos> I'll do whatever you want.<eos> Just please don't make me go back there!<eos> Give me your money!<eos> No!<eos> I have so much to teach you, Bruce.<eos> But your pain... it blocks you from who I need you to become.<eos> Who Gotham needs you to become.<eos> If one's feelings and emotions are strong enough, their consequences can follow you back into the real world.<eos> I don't know what you want from me.

Excuse me?<eos> I'm looking for a friend of mine.<eos> Knock yourself out.<eos> Her name's Selina.<eos> Selina Kyle.<eos> She knew Barbara Kean.<eos> She used to hang out here.<eos> I think.<eos> You think?<eos> You don't sound real close.
You think?<eos> You don't sound real close.<eos> Oh, no, we were... kind of, but she was always really bossy, you know?<eos> And then we got into this fight.<eos> I was gone for awhile and...<eos> Yeah, I don't care.<eos> Try Gotham General.<eos> Did something happen to her?<eos> I heard she fell out of a window and is in pretty bad shape.<eos> What are you doing in here?
They can't do what I can do.<eos> I will heal you.<eos> I promise.<eos> Isn't it enough, you holding me against my will?<eos> Must you also hover while I work?<eos> I'd think you would prefer this to playing nursemaid to Fish Mooney.<eos> I was able to save Fish Mooney despite the fact that she had one foot in the grave.<eos> I took it as a personal challenge.<eos> Grandstanding doesn't suit you.<eos> Were you able to accomplish what we asked?
Were you able to accomplish what we asked?<eos> See for yourself.<eos> Hello?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Someone tell me what's going on.<eos> Previously, the Alice Tetch virus could only be transmitted through direct contact with her blood.<eos> What is that?<eos> Someone please help!<eos> We've done it.<eos> You've weaponized the virus.

Detective Gordon, what is the meaning of this?<eos> Who let you in here?<eos> Oswald Cobblepot is alive and back in Gotham.<eos> He paid me a visit this morning.<eos> He knows Nygma's disappearance has something to do with the Court.<eos> Is that all?<eos> I'm tired of being kept in the dark.<eos> I want a seat at the table.<eos> How ambitious.<eos> You asked me to be on the Court.

We need to remove it before that happens.<eos> You want me to give up my memory of that day?<eos> No.<eos> The events themselves will remain.<eos> I'm only talking about releasing you from the destructive emotions connected with them.<eos> And if I don't want to be released?<eos> You have chosen your prison, Bruce.<eos> I'm offering you a way out.<eos> Why?<eos> You said I was to become the protector of Gotham.

Hello?<eos> GCPD.<eos> Freeze.<eos> The police, thank God.<eos> Keep your hands where we can see them!<eos> I didn't want to kill these people, I-I...<eos> I just lost control.<eos> On the ground, now.<eos> I'm the good guy here.<eos> Oh, you're just like them.
You're out to get me.<eos> What have you done with the virus?<eos> Who has it?<eos> A woman, named Kathryn.<eos> - Where is she?<eos> Where's she taken it?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> As I told you, I was brought here against my will.<eos> I know nothing of their other plans.<eos> Hugo Strange, you're under arrest for attempts to weaponize a viral... hell, you know why.
The daughters of Gotham.<eos> Socialites who believe they hold the power in this city, when really what they really are is window dressing.<eos> My family was one of the first in Gotham.<eos> We've been on the Court since its founding, making the difficult decisions to ensure its long-term survival.<eos> Which is why I've brought you here.<eos> Interesting centerpiece.<eos> It's an aerosol dispersal bomb.<eos> Dispersal bomb for what?<eos> For the Alice Tetch virus.<eos> So that's what you meant by showing Gotham - its darkest self.
Because if it's not, if you try to stop the bomb or interfere in any way,<eos> Talon has instructions to execute you on the spot.<eos> Talon, right?<eos> I'm assuming that's a nickname.<eos> Right.<eos> Wouldn't want to miss out on the sounds of 200 people tearing each other's throats out.<eos> The device is in place.<eos> Hello, Jim.<eos> I was beginning to think I wasn't going to hear from you.<eos> I met you the other night, didn't I? When you took Nygma?
Everyone out!<eos> Now!<eos> Took you long enough.<eos> - I need to get these people out of here.<eos> - And I need to talk to the Court.<eos> Have them turn over Ed. Remember?<eos> There is a bomb down there with a weaponized version of the Alice Tetch virus.<eos> If you want to be here when it goes off, be my guest.<eos> - What about our deal?<eos> - You just torched their assassin.
Mario didn't deserve what happened to him.<eos> You want to blame me for Mario's death, fine!<eos> You want to walk out that door and never come back, I can't stop you.<eos> But it will not help.<eos> Believe me.<eos> The other day, you asked me at Mario's grave how I could walk away.<eos> Move on.<eos> I guess you know how.<eos> My name is Oswald Cobblepot.<eos> You cannot do this to me.
When this guy gets home, we got to ask him to kick on the heat.<eos> It's colder in here than it is out there.<eos> Fascinating.<eos> I know you're hell-bent on getting revenge on Nygma and all, and forming an army of freaks is a great plan, I mean, it was my idea, but...<eos> Quiet.<eos> I think I hear something.<eos> Do you think it's him?<eos> Mr. Fries.<eos> Welcome home.<eos> I see you still hold me responsible for all of that awful monster rhetoric I spewed during my campaign.
Quiet.<eos> I think I hear something.<eos> Do you think it's him?<eos> Mr. Fries.<eos> Welcome home.<eos> I see you still hold me responsible for all of that awful monster rhetoric I spewed during my campaign.<eos> You ran people like me out of Gotham.<eos> We both know I only said those things because that's what the voters wanted to hear.<eos> Your experiments, Mr. Fries.<eos> You're trying to reverse your condition, aren't you?

Frank murdered your father.<eos> What I need to know is if you hold us accountable for his action.<eos> Frank acted alone.<eos> He admitted as much to me.<eos> Good.<eos> Then we can proceed.<eos> The city needs you now more than ever, James.<eos> There's turmoil ahead, and good men like you are going to be needed to hold it together.<eos> But make no mistake, the Court, and the Court alone, can save Gotham.<eos> So what do you want me to do?
You're gonna make a big production of this, aren't you?<eos> Only someone with power and connections would have information on this group.<eos> I need to speak with Gotham's elite.<eos> And nothing brings out the bourgeoisie quite like opening night at the theater.<eos> Where wilt thou lead me?<eos> Speak, for I will go no further.<eos> I say, Ghost, speak your business or I shall go no further!<eos> My business is not with you, Prince of Denmark. But with your audience.<eos> I've come to address you, the ruling class of Gotham.<eos> You've kept a secret for far too long.
My business is not with you, Prince of Denmark. But with your audience.<eos> I've come to address you, the ruling class of Gotham.<eos> You've kept a secret for far too long.<eos> But tonight. I will kidnap and torture one of you to expose the truth.<eos> So, spread the word to all your friends, the Riddler is coming.<eos> Also, I found your performance to be wooden and... unrealistic.<eos> And scene.<eos> And that, my old mucker, is checkmate.<eos> Good game, Alfred.<eos> You let me win, didn't you, Master Bruce?

My gosh, these are delicious.<eos> All the same, Mr. Mayor, we'd like to move you to a safe house immediately.<eos> Did you not see the muscle twins over there?<eos> I'm perfectly safe here.<eos> Besides, what's the Riddler want with me, anyway?<eos> We're not really sure.<eos> He did say something to the crowd at the theater about a secret.<eos> My life's an open book.<eos> Are you feeling okay, Mr. Mayor?<eos> You look a little...

I said I was tired, then snuck out of my room.<eos> I'm dying, aren't I?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> The process that brought you into this world was flawed.<eos> Will I die before Bruce returns?<eos> No, Bruce Wayne will be back in Gotham well before then.<eos> I know we've asked a lot of you.<eos> After Indian Hill I didn't know what to do or where to go.<eos> You gave me a purpose.
Second floor.<eos> It's a trap.<eos> Please don't kill me!<eos> Please don't kill me!<eos> Stay here.<eos> So, Jimbo, I know you must be wondering what I want from that ding-dong Aubrey James.<eos> Well... turns out, he has answers to a riddle, one that you put into motion when you sent Barbara down to Dock 9C.<eos> The question being, who runs Gotham?<eos> - I got to get out of here. - No, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Mr. Mayor, you're in no condition to go anywhere.
Where is she?<eos> Not here.<eos> I know she and Nygma kidnapped Mayor James.<eos> Nygma mentioned Dock 9C and she's the only one I told.<eos> Nygma's got a big mouth.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, let me get this straight. You mean this whole stupid riddle thing with Nygma is real?<eos> What?<eos> He clearly knows everything already.<eos> I heard a rumor he hurt you pretty bad a while back, both of you.<eos> Surprised you're defending him.
You see, everything that you say just makes me more intrigued.<eos> And determined. I will be the one who unmasks them.<eos> You're insane.<eos> Remember me, Aubrey?<eos> I know that voice.<eos> I'm so glad.<eos> I thought maybe it got muffled.<eos> We put that box on your head.<eos> That was fun. We should do that again for old times' sake.<eos> You don't get it, do you?
He's taunting us.<eos> If he kills James, the press is gonna hand us our asses on the 6:00 news.<eos> Harvey, you're a genius.<eos> Yeah, tell me something I don't know.<eos> I have a question.<eos> What is this mysterious "Court" that controls the levers of power here in Gotham?<eos> Alvarez, go to channel seven!<eos> Find out where Nygma's broadcasting from.<eos> And will they let our dear mayor's head be blown to bits in order to keep their anonymity?<eos> Are you watching the television?
They'll probably kill him.<eos> And if I don't, we'll never stop them from destroying the city.<eos> I know what you're thinking, Aubrey.<eos> That the police are gonna somehow find you, rescue you.<eos> But I gave the GCPD every chance to save you.<eos> But they're no match for me!<eos> We're both dead men.<eos> You don't get it, do you?<eos> The Court isn't gonna bargain with you.<eos> You underestimate me, Mr. James.
But when I reveal myself, you will never be the same.<eos> What am I?<eos> - I don't care, I...<eos> - Betrayal.<eos> That's how every friendship ends.<eos> So... so what good are friends anyway?<eos> Who are they?<eos> The answer to your question.<eos> Hello, Mr. Nygma.<eos> I hear you've been asking about us.

I hear you've been asking about us.<eos> How do I know you're real?<eos> Isn't that the point of a good mystery?<eos> You're never quite sure what to believe until the end.<eos> Gordon could've put you up to this.<eos> I assure you, Detective Gordon had to be convinced to bring you here.<eos> But let me put it like this:<eos> That question Professor Strange had you ask<eos> Bruce Wayne and Lucius Fox last year at Indian Hill, the one that has tortured you,<eos> the one you'll never be able to answer.
That question Professor Strange had you ask<eos> Bruce Wayne and Lucius Fox last year at Indian Hill, the one that has tortured you,<eos> the one you'll never be able to answer.<eos> That answer is with me.<eos> What now?<eos> Get in.<eos> And all your questions will be answered.<eos> You won't be needing the gun.<eos> You've made us proud, Detective Gordon.<eos> What are you going to do with him?
People can't help themselves.<eos> She's changed, baby.<eos> When are you gonna see that?<eos> Shut up, Butch!<eos> Move!<eos> This is trouble.<eos> It's good to be home.<eos> FYI, I've been to Wayne Manor.<eos> It's way cleaner.<eos> You never said anything about Fries being a part of this.
Because I care about you.<eos> You're not even a real person.<eos> You're awake.<eos> Selina, where are you going?<eos> To kill someone.<eos> What is this mysterious "Court"<eos> Ed went on television, and voilà, he disappears.<eos> - Oswald, drop it.<eos> - No can do.<eos> You cannot do this to me.
Help.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Stop that!<eos> Stop!<eos> Okay. Come on, come on.<eos> Stop that.<eos> - Stop it!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> You don't understand.
Okay. Come on, come on.<eos> Stop that.<eos> - Stop it!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> I shall set you free, Bruce, free from the blinding rage of your darkest memory.<eos> There is one final step to take.<eos> My parents' murder.<eos> You want to take away the pain of that night.
Odd that Strange said nothing.<eos> He and I will be having words.<eos> Who else have you brought into your confidence?<eos> Harvey Bullock, obviously.<eos> What is this, an exit interview?<eos> If you like.<eos> Who else have you spoken to?<eos> Who else have you spoken to?<eos> The Court ordered my father murdered.<eos> You drove my uncle to suicide.
Who else have you spoken to?<eos> The Court ordered my father murdered.<eos> You drove my uncle to suicide.<eos> You can go to hell.<eos> And what are you now, their lapdog?<eos> I know you're a lunatic.<eos> At least you used to stand for something.<eos> Your attempts to turn Captain Barnes against me are tiresome.<eos> He was following you not because I asked him to, but because he knows, as I do... that you are an enemy of Gotham.<eos> You Gordons always were stubborn.
No sabotage.<eos> Of course.<eos> And no murder on the premises.<eos> Agreed.<eos> Also, there needs to be a six-hour window, post-escape.<eos> If I get outside and I'm worrying about you stabbing my neck, I won't be able to concentrate, and that's not good.<eos> Agreed, reluctantly.<eos> Then we help each other escape, together, so that we may be free to murder each other outside.<eos> Deal.<eos> What are you going to show me?
The city honored them.<eos> I honored them.<eos> He threatened exposure.<eos> What of their boy, Bruce?<eos> Their son.<eos> He was not harmed.<eos> That, at least, is something.<eos> All this time, Bruce, the Court was never more than a means to an end, allowing us to maintain order in Gotham.<eos> Us?<eos> Who are you?
Right. I'll be back in a minute.<eos> Help!<eos> Help!<eos> Let me out of here,<eos> - or I kill him!<eos> Now! - Easy.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Open my cell!<eos> Shoot him!<eos> What are you waiting for?
Well. I've had some practice, haven't I?<eos> All right, if you see anything, let me know, okay?<eos> You got it.<eos> Detective Gordon.<eos> I suppose I really shouldn't be surprised.<eos> No, you shouldn't.<eos> Put her in the box.<eos> I've seen the map.<eos> I know the Court has secret locations across the city.<eos> Where are you hiding the bomb?

He's in the wind.<eos> We just busted that dude five minutes ago.<eos> There's more.<eos> What is this doing in here?<eos> It's supposed to be in Lucius' office.<eos> He must have moved it.<eos> He said he needed to run some tests.<eos> The virus sample we got from Hugo Strange... it's gone.<eos> Maybe Lucius took it.<eos> - You're the only two with the combination, right?
On your hands.<eos> Thomas Wayne stood against the Court.<eos> He threatened to expose us.<eos> He paid the price.<eos> And my mother?<eos> She had to die as well?<eos> Why is Bruce Wayne here?<eos> He has come to pass judgment.<eos> Enough of this.<eos> You are the leader of the Court.
You didn't hear what she said to me last night, Harvey.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Go.<eos> I'll be back as soon as I can.<eos> Come again?<eos> I said, Oswald Cobblepot is alive.<eos> He's lying.<eos> I wish that were true.<eos> He disappeared for days, and then he shows up with some insane story about him and Penguin being trapped in bird cages and escaping together?<eos> - What'd you say you used, pudding?
One problem.<eos> The place where Bruce and I found the original crystal owl should be here.<eos> Marked.<eos> But it's not.<eos> Well, maybe it's an old owl that hasn't been updated.<eos> No, mate, no.<eos> You're missing the point.<eos> No, look.<eos> The Court hasn't marked all hideouts.<eos> So how did you find the house when you stole the owl?
- Where the hell is Gordon, anyway?<eos> - He had to do something.<eos> We're gonna have to give you a badge or something one of these days.<eos> Please be very careful with this.<eos> GCPD!<eos> Nobody...<eos> Go get Bruce!<eos> Don't move a muscle.<eos> Obviously, I surrender.<eos> You know where to take it.
Guns down, people.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Everybody just step back.<eos> You really did it, huh?<eos> You injected yourself with the virus?<eos> You're just like Jim, you seem to think it's a bad thing.<eos> Where is he?<eos> He went to see you at your brownstone, and now we can't get in touch with him.<eos> Well, look at you, all worried about your hero.<eos> You put him up on this pedestal, forced him to deny his true self.
Harvey?<eos> You there?<eos> We're here, buddy.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Harvey, she's got the virus.<eos> - She's buried me alive... - Shh.<eos> I do the talking.<eos> Now, if you're quiet, I'll let you listen.<eos> So, here's the deal.<eos> I buried Jim Gordon alive in a location that you might find if you looked long enough, but certainly not before he runs out of air.
How much longer are we gonna put up with this?<eos> Jim.<eos> Harvey, what'd you find?<eos> You were right about the walkie.<eos> It's got a one mile radius.<eos> Lucius couldn't trace a signal, but when we looked at a map, we figured there was only one place she could take you:<eos> Jackson Park.<eos> I should've known.<eos> But that's nothing but dense forest.<eos> - You'll never...
But that's nothing but dense forest.<eos> - You'll never...<eos> - It's a place to start.<eos> We're gonna find you, brother, I promise.<eos> Harvey.<eos> Listen, I know he's your mate, but with everything else that's going on, with Bruce missing, the bomb, you certain searching for Jim is the best use of your time?<eos> If the situation were reversed, he'd do the same for me.<eos> Besides, I got you.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - I want you to squeeze Strange, find out everything he knows.
It affects my concentration.<eos> And my grip!<eos> Please.<eos> Don't let me fall.<eos> We can discuss this in a civilized manner!<eos> Oh, that's rich, coming from the likes of you.<eos> Who's about to poison thousands of people and turn them into raving lunatics!<eos> Now, where is Bruce Wayne?<eos> And where is the bomb?<eos> If I tell you, you drop me.
I didn't have the authority just to hang you off the side of a bloody building, did I?<eos> !<eos> Hey, see that fire escape over there?<eos> That leads directly to the street and to your freedom.<eos> Now, I won't stop you.<eos> I just want to know where my boy is.<eos> All right.<eos> The leader has taken Bruce to Wayne Enterprises.<eos> They'll have a view of the street below as it fills with people affected by the virus,<eos> - but you're too late.

- Days.<eos> It will be...<eos> - I'll take option "B," Ed.<eos> Since saying that ridiculous name would be torture itself.<eos> Very well.<eos> Slow and painful it shall be.<eos> Uh, hello?<eos> Do I get no say in all this?<eos> - See how it feels?<eos> - Guys, you hear something?
Or is it fear?<eos> Hi-ya, Fish.<eos> - How you been?<eos> - Well, let's see.<eos> I was alive... and then I was dead.<eos> And then I was alive.<eos> Things are looking up.<eos> My, my, my.<eos> Now, this is quite a gathering.<eos> You have to love Gotham.
I was alive... and then I was dead.<eos> And then I was alive.<eos> Things are looking up.<eos> My, my, my.<eos> Now, this is quite a gathering.<eos> You have to love Gotham.<eos> People always pointing guns at each other.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> You... shall... see.<eos> And as for you, whoever you may be, please excuse us.
I want my savings.<eos> - My money, my savings.<eos> - This account was closed<eos> - due to unpaid fees.<eos> - No, my money, my savings, my life.<eos> - You have no money. - Everything.<eos> The account is closed.<eos> Give me my money now! God.<eos> Um, security?<eos> Hey, what are you...
Really?<eos> So tell me, James, what's it feel like?<eos> Like it's taking all my willpower... not to kill you.<eos> Ooh, my.<eos> Harvey, when you say Hugo here can save the city, does that mean there's a... cure for this virus?<eos> Fish, I swear to God, if you don't step back, I will shoot you and these two nimrods right here, right now!<eos> Hugo, is it true that you're the only one that can stop this madness?<eos> Obviously, I can't give him up now.<eos> Fine, you had your chance.<eos> Did you really think that I would come without backup?
- dial it down, buddy.<eos> - Victor, looks like our little Detective Gordon is overheating.<eos> Perhaps you should cool him off.<eos> Both of them.<eos> Marvelous.<eos> Just marvelous.<eos> There he is, the real James Gordon.<eos> Nice to meet you, at last.<eos> There we go, Master Bruce.<eos> Two lumps, just how you like it.
You hungry, mate?<eos> Can I whip you up a sandwich?<eos> Anyway, if all goes well, we should be able to head back to Wayne Manor tomorrow.<eos> Although, I was thinking that we could go abroad.<eos> We could go to Switzerland.<eos> I mean, we used to go with your mum and dad this time of year.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Your attempts to elicit an emotional response by reminding me of shared memories is clumsy and pathetic.<eos> The last memory I have is of you killing the best friend and teacher I ever had.<eos> You mean that old geezer that... kidnapped you, poisoned your mind, then tried to turn you into a mass murderer.
The hell's wrong with you?<eos> Alvarez, I'm talking to you.<eos> I said leave me alone!<eos> So, I will ask you again.<eos> Who's coming?<eos> I mean, I thought the man that I dispatched at Wayne Enterprises was the leader of the Court of Owls.<eos> I want you to leave.<eos> Yeah, well, that ain't gonna happen, is it, mate?<eos> You can't get rid of me that easy.<eos> You have to remember who you are.

I have a destiny.<eos> Now, you listen to me.<eos> That man that wanted you to detonate that bomb... whatever he promised you... freedom from pain, power... none of it, none of it was real.<eos> I want you to remember what is real.<eos> I know what's real!<eos> I got vengeance for my parents' murder.<eos> That's real!<eos> No.<eos> No, that's not real.<eos> What's real is every time that you were sick when you were a kid... your mum used to sit up with you all night and read to you till you fell asleep.
And when your dad found you, how he cried.<eos> That's real.<eos> Yes... your parents died in that alley three years ago and maybe that man took away the pain of that night.<eos> But there is no life, there is no love without pain.<eos> He could not touch the love that your mom and dad gave you, that you still have it in you, that you still have in here.<eos> The same love that I have for you.<eos> I love you, Master Bruce.<eos> I would do anything for you.<eos> I would die for you.<eos> You must... find that love again.
All individuals must remain indoors.<eos> Any activity outdoors will be considered criminal activity.<eos> Clear here.<eos> Let's go, let's go. Clear out.<eos> Remain indoors.<eos> He's following directions or something.<eos> I've got to find out who's controlling him, who's brainwashed him.<eos> And then what?<eos> I'm gonna kill the bastard.<eos> You two wait here.
Not exactly.<eos> Let's make Gotham beg.<eos> Seek out the Yuyan building.<eos> Find the demon's head.<eos> Fulfill your destiny.<eos> Right.<eos> Find Bullock, let him know where we are.<eos> I'm gonna follow Bruce.<eos> I wouldn't touch that, Bruce.<eos> You know who I am?
But he completed his task.<eos> The Court of Owls is destroyed, Gotham burns, and you... are here.<eos> He told me to complete my training, to find the demon's head.<eos> You already have, Bruce.<eos> I'm the one you seek.<eos> I'm the demon's head.<eos> I am Ra's al Ghul.<eos> Why have you come to me, Bruce?<eos> The Sensei told me to seek you out.<eos> That you would complete my training.

But I don't know why.
This man... is your past, Bruce.<eos> Now, embrace your future.<eos> Kill him.<eos> Join me.<eos> Fulfill your destiny.<eos> He's wrong.<eos> Master Bruce, there's no other way to put it.<eos> He's wrong.<eos> Your destiny is to be Bruce Wayne.<eos> And one day, you're gonna remember that.

We need to kill her.<eos> How much longer are we gonna wait?<eos> Come on.<eos> Nygma chopped off your hand.<eos> He almost killed me.<eos> And now Barbara's partners with him?<eos> That's the mother of all insults.<eos> The city is gonna pay us a lot of money to get Tetch back.<eos> We need to let that play out before we do anything rash.<eos> I know you two are close.

Nothing.<eos> Any word from city hall?<eos> Trust me, we're about to own this town.<eos> Parts of it quite literally.<eos> Where's Ed?<eos> He was just here a minute ago.<eos> Tetch?<eos> !<eos> Nygma!<eos> How could you let this happen?
Watch a man tied to a chair!<eos> You idiots can't even do that!<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Look, I'm not trying to aggravate you; It's just this doesn't exactly have an abovetheboard feeling about it.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Barbara and Nygma have Tetch.<eos> - They're ransoming the city.<eos> - So what does that have to do with me?<eos> You're handing me over to him.

Look, he cannot be trusted.<eos> You're risking everything based on the word of a sociopath.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Get in the car.<eos> What?<eos> It's gonna be fine.<eos> Yeah, Penguin, Nygma, Tetch all in the same place for a highstakes hostage swap.<eos> What could possibly go wrong?<eos> Do you mind?<eos> Look, if I'm gonna be the city's sacrificial lamb, the least you could do is lead me to the slaughter with a little dignity.
Now for the pièce de résistance...<eos> Welcome to S.T.A.R. Labs.<eos> I'm sorry, did you make a hologram of me?<eos> Francisco, you made it perfectly clear you didn't want to be a tour guide.<eos> You're not.<eos> You're a virtual tour guide.<eos> That falls under the umbrella of not wanting to be a tour guide.<eos> - On we go.<eos> - My name is Francisco Ramon.<eos> I wasn't always the esteemed engineer you see before you.
We haven't seen much of you since Christmas.<eos> That's very sweet of you.<eos> I'm doing well, thank you.<eos> You know, what Savitar did... forcing you to hurt people...<eos> Savitar was controlling me, okay?<eos> As far as I'm concerned, my conscience is clear.<eos> Really?<eos> Then why the Zolpidem?<eos> Are you having trouble sleeping?<eos> Why don't we stop playing games, Dr. Snow, and you tell me what you actually came for rather than accusing me of having insomnia?
Caitlin, where is everybody?<eos> Nobody's here.<eos> No one showed up.<eos> A custom... our first customers!<eos> Welcome.<eos> Welcome to the grand. S.T.A.R. Labs museum opening, and today, for your ticket price of admission... today only... you also get a free steaming cup of joe.<eos> - Ticket price?<eos> - Yep.<eos> I thought this museum was free.<eos> Did you find us through social media?
Okay.<eos> So you failed.<eos> So nobody came to your opening.<eos> Don't end it like this.<eos> Greatness takes time... and you know this.<eos> If a string is in a knot, patience will untie it.<eos> Patience can do lots of things.<eos> Have you ever tried it?<eos> All right.<eos> All right, guys. You ready?
Morillo was apprehended by a new speedster, who goes by the name Kid Flash.<eos> Well, that settles it.<eos> I think you're officially Kid Flash now.<eos> Yeah, it's growing on me.<eos> And this rifle is growing on me.<eos> Heat-seeking bullets are just the beginning of what this bad boy can do.<eos> How did you end up with Plunder's rifle?<eos> Barry stole it for me.<eos> Right, Barr?<eos> So you plundered Plunder?
- Can't wait.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I called the local elementary school, and gave the principal discounted tickets.<eos> I figured, hey, you know, if the kids love it, they'll tell their parents, and, well, the rest writes itself.<eos> You, Francisco... are brilliant.<eos> Of course, science is what will inspire these children... not just The Flash.<eos> Check it out.<eos> Welcome to S.T.A.R. Labs.<eos> My name is Francisco Ramon.<eos> I wasn't always the esteemed engineer you see before you, but after years of hard work and studying, I joined S.T.A.R. Labs.
- Not on my Earth.<eos> - On my Earth, we get reptiles.<eos> - Whoa.<eos> I present to you McSnurtle... the turtle.<eos> Careful, she bites.<eos> - I... this is for me?<eos> - It's for the housewarming.<eos> - Wow!<eos> - Hey.<eos> You two did really well.
- Hello, hello.<eos> Hi.<eos> I hope I'm not too late.<eos> - Right on time. - Yeah.<eos> Good, good.<eos> This is a... it's for you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Um, yeah. So we all talked it over, and welcome to the team.<eos> You being serious?
We decided we'd invest in an alternate accessory.<eos> Voilà.<eos> Every time you go outside, solar energy will recharge it.<eos> Guys, this means so much to me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Of course.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Wow. - Ta-da!<eos> Hey, guys. I asked myself to say a few words, um, on this occasion.<eos> A home, you know, it's more than bricks and mortar and a turtle.
- Welcome to the team. - Yeah.<eos> If his powers are linked to the energy that ties together the multiverse...<eos> He can open a breach to any Earth he wants.<eos> The thing they never tell you about fighting villains is that nothing ever stays the same.<eos> The harder you work to take down the bad guys, the more they up their game.<eos> Gentlemen, welcome to the future of crime.<eos> Not even the military has these yet.<eos> Looks like Christmas came early.<eos> You know what the only problem is?<eos> You're on Santa's naughty list.
Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> - Go Kid Flash!<eos> - Go Kid Flash!<eos> Nice save!<eos> Could not have scripted it better myself.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Barry did most of the heavy lifting.<eos> Yes, bravo, boys.<eos> Although I did find at least six ways you could have done it more efficiently, just... just saying.
- Bond, are you coming?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> So exactly how many hot cheerleaders?<eos> I was a good boy.<eos> You know, he's just been looking forward to this for a long time; He's enjoying the moment.<eos> Well, I'm glad you have his back.<eos> We have each other's back.<eos> It's actually been really nice having him out there.<eos> Hey, I meant to ask you.<eos> When you found the Electric Gang, did you see them meeting with anyone else? - Like who?
He really does want to help in his own snobbish, thoughtless way.<eos> He is right.<eos> I mean, he's kind of a dick about it, but you can't argue with his math.<eos> Okay, well, then, we'll find another way to make this work.<eos> We need to.<eos> Iris isn't gonna die.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Gotcha.<eos> Freeze!<eos> How'd you get in here?
Yeah, it's definitely a meta.<eos> I'll have Julian look into his meta database, but I think this is someone new.<eos> New and dangerous.<eos> Well, it's nothing that The Flash and Kid Flash can't handle.<eos> My two superhero boys.<eos> He is doing great.<eos> Speaking of my kids,<eos> Iris, she tell you about this arms dealer story she's following?<eos> Yeah, she's mentioned it.<eos> Well, now that you're her live-in boyfriend, could you look out for her and maybe get her to back off a bit?
Iris, she tell you about this arms dealer story she's following?<eos> Yeah, she's mentioned it.<eos> Well, now that you're her live-in boyfriend, could you look out for her and maybe get her to back off a bit?<eos> Because this isn't something she should be doing on her own.<eos> I agree.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> She seem... okay to you, otherwise?<eos> Yeah, why?<eos> Do you not think so?<eos> If you guys got something going on, I hope you know you can talk to me.
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave the building.<eos> Speedster.<eos> That's fun.<eos> I like to have fun too.<eos> I see you've got a lot to learn about your power.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Like that.<eos> How do you do that?<eos> That's cool.<eos> You're harboring a fugitive from justice.
That's cool.<eos> You're harboring a fugitive from justice.<eos> Our world has a strict ban on inter-dimensional travel.<eos> He knew that when he came here.<eos> - So you tracked him here?<eos> - Honestly, it wasn't that hard.<eos> Not when he's beaming "H.R. Wells'".<eos> Adventures in the Multiverse" back chapter by chapter.<eos> You know what?<eos> Not without going through us. If I really wanted to go through you, you would all be dead.
She took H.R.?<eos> Can she do that?<eos> I mean, I though this whole trial by combat thing had rules.<eos> Which apparently we broke when we tried to get the drop on her.<eos> Well, that wasn't very clever, was it? A deal's a deal.<eos> It should be honored.<eos> You know what?<eos> You're right, Julian.<eos> A deal is a deal.<eos> And our deal was that I would train so that I could fight Gypsy, but I guess you two wanted to go behind my back and try to sub in?
I just... guess this whole "not getting faster" thing, it just has me rattled.<eos> I was always able to do it before, you know?<eos> I mean, against Reverse Flash and then against Zoom, but...<eos> Savitar's on a whole other level.<eos> And knowing what he'll do to Iris if I fail?<eos> I'm afraid just... thinking what's gonna happen to H.R. if I don't beat Gypsy.<eos> But you, you're the hero.<eos> I mean, how do you handle all this pressure all the time?<eos> By just leaning on all of you guys.<eos> You know, I mean, you're always in my corner, helping me face my fears.
This'll rip a hole right through you.<eos> Everyone's gotta go sometime, right?<eos> And I am pretty sure today just... isn't my day.<eos> What the hell, sis?<eos> Are you trying to get yourself killed?<eos> God, okay, look, we gotta get you out of here before CCPD sees you. Don't worry.<eos> Dad's, like, my biggest fan now.<eos> He's totally cool with me doing stuff like this.<eos> Hell no, I ain't cool with this.<eos> You two almost compromised a major CCPD sting operation that took the DA's office months to assemble.

In an attempt to stop the evil speedster Savitar, I was accidentally thrust into the future, and I saw him murder the woman that I love.<eos> But I won't let that happen.<eos> I'm gonna do everything in my power to change the future, and I'm the only one fast enough to keep her alive.<eos> I am The Flash.<eos> Previously on "The Flash"...<eos> When I threw the Philosopher's Stone into the Speed Force, I accidentally ran into the future.<eos> I saw Savitar murder you.<eos> - How are you gonna tell Dad?<eos> - I'm not.<eos> If you guys got something going on, I hope you know you can talk to me.
Allen, this is an active investigation.<eos> There is protocol to follow... surely?<eos> Not if we're gonna figure this out.<eos> Okay, I'll bag the body myself and meet you there.<eos> Great.<eos> Iris, hey.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm just, running up against a deadline, so...<eos> Since I have you both, I wanted to ask, um, Cecile's daughter, Joanie, is in town, and I was thinking that maybe we could all get together.<eos> If you don't think it's too soon.
When Barry threw the Philosopher's Stone into the Speed Force, there was an explosion, and he was propelled to the future.<eos> The future?<eos> It was a few months from now.<eos> What he saw was himself standing before Savitar... and me.<eos> Right before Savitar killed me.<eos> So you're saying that in a few months... you die?<eos> Unless we can change the future, Dad.<eos> Which we're gonna do, Joe, okay?<eos> I'm not... we're not gonna let this happen.<eos> How long have you known about this?
All right.<eos> You don't have to come, Julian.<eos> - You don't even know Harry.<eos> - Come on.<eos> A chance to travel to another dimension...<eos> I mean, I wasn't gonna miss that.<eos> We're not going sightseeing.<eos> Neither am I.<eos> Well, damn.<eos> All right, Jesse, Wally, you make sure this city's safe while I'm gone, all right?
- But, Flash... if he were to be defeated, the other gorillas would see his weakness and would no longer follow him.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna kill anyone, not even a gorilla.<eos> Kill or be killed!<eos> This is the only law Gorilla Kind understands.<eos> How do you benefit from this, Grodd?<eos> Solovar falls.<eos> I take his place.<eos> I rule the gorillas, and I promise to keep them in Gorilla City.<eos> How do we know we can trust you?<eos> Because... even though you sent me away, your Earth is still my home.
I'm not complete without you.<eos> Stay.<eos> Barry, do you really think you could kill this Solovar?<eos> Do you think you could take a life?<eos> It is as I feared.<eos> The humans court war with Gorilla Kind.<eos> Why did you not tell me, Grodd, more humans had entered the city?<eos> I was about to inform you, Solovar.<eos> Why?<eos> Why are you here?
No, no.<eos> I'm...<eos> I...<eos> We came here in peace.<eos> We entered your city by mistake.<eos> Uh, we mean you no harm.<eos> Please... just let me and my friends go, and I promise, we'll never come back here again.<eos> My brethren have seen you.<eos> Your fate is sealed.<eos> You will all die by my hand... in the arena... so that all will know that Solovar's justice is wise and swift.
Please... just let me and my friends go, and I promise, we'll never come back here again.<eos> My brethren have seen you.<eos> Your fate is sealed.<eos> You will all die by my hand... in the arena... so that all will know that Solovar's justice is wise and swift.<eos> All right, I'll make you a deal.<eos> I'll fight you in the arena... just me.<eos> But if I beat you, you let my friends go, and you leave us alone for good.<eos> I accept.<eos> Humans and their arrogance.<eos> First you will suffer.
All my days, this is quite the reversal of our fortune.<eos> Reversal...<eos> Barry, it's time to pull a reverse Flash.<eos> Do it!<eos> He did it!<eos> He actually did it.<eos> He bloody well did it.<eos> I won't kill him!<eos> I won't!<eos> I know you all fear humans!
Reversal...<eos> Barry, it's time to pull a reverse Flash.<eos> Do it!<eos> He did it!<eos> He actually did it.<eos> He bloody well did it.<eos> I won't kill him!<eos> I won't!<eos> I know you all fear humans!<eos> You think we want war with Gorilla Kind!
All those... all those numbers.<eos> It's only four digits.<eos> Why is he still here?<eos> Because we couldn't do it without him.<eos> I thank you, Francisco.<eos> Fran...<eos> Francisco?<eos> Don't ask.<eos> Yo, so what actually happened?<eos> You fight some really super-smart apes, or what?
You like him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He makes you happy?<eos> Dad...<eos> Okay.<eos> That's it?<eos> You're not gonna yell?<eos> You're not gonna throw that over there?<eos> Your happiness is what matters to me.<eos> You're both adults.
Grodd said he always thinks ahead.<eos> Just like the Reverse-Flash.<eos> He didn't have you to open a breach, so he used Gypsy instead.<eos> So that means...<eos> Grodd's here.<eos> Something tells me he's not alone.<eos> Any sign of him yet?<eos> Not since you asked 30 seconds ago.<eos> Okay, he's a giant gorilla, who's probably leading an army of giant gorillas.<eos> - How can you not find him?
Well, that's the thing. Anybody can actually draw.<eos> It's just that some have more developed visual cortex and manual ability, as you know.<eos> And right now, these magnets are taking that part of his brain and lighting' it up.<eos> Well, it worked.<eos> Now we have a new problem.<eos> We have to figure out who the hell this is.<eos> Good evening, General.<eos> Color and number of the day.<eos> Purple 246.<eos> Are you all right, sir?
Okay.<eos> Short-range ballistic missile authorized to fire from Fort Reynolds.<eos> How much time do we have?<eos> Minutes.<eos> Grodd, what have you done?<eos> Can we stop it from here?<eos> Military weapons are basically analog.<eos> I mean, they still use floppy disks.<eos> I'm going after it.<eos> Guys, no, look, I appreciate it, but I need you to stay here, okay?

You did it. This is...<eos> this is fantastic.<eos> Well done, Joe.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Dad, say something, please.<eos> My baby girl.<eos> You have grown into a beautiful woman.<eos> You're marrying the best man I know.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You two bring me nothing but joy.
At least, yeah.<eos> And that's a great story.<eos> But you missed the point?<eos> I... yeah, I...<eos> I don't... it was spontaneous.<eos> I knew you'd say yes, and I wanted to surprise you.<eos> Yo. There's a three-alarm fire in the Raab building.<eos> Fire department is evacuating it now.<eos> Jesse is a little preoccupied with the ring, - so it's just you and me. - Okay.<eos> - What you two waiting for?
You know the drill.<eos> Just let your mind go blank.<eos> We'll take care of the rest.<eos> Okay?<eos> Just let Savitar back in the driver's seat once more.<eos> - Brilliant.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Let's just get this over with, yeah?<eos> Bow before my greatness.<eos> Be in awe, as you are in the presence of the Almighty.
You've always been small.<eos> Reverb told you that you could have been a god.<eos> But instead, you'd rather work as... tech support.<eos> You want to tell me why we're enemies?<eos> Because we had to be.<eos> Only one of us could live.<eos> You thought that Thawne and Zoom were your biggest foes, but... but it's me.<eos> It's always been me, Barry.<eos> Man, what did we ever do to you?<eos> You took everything from me!
- I created you?<eos> - No.<eos> I created myself, Barry.<eos> Only I can bring out my greatness.<eos> Your greatness?<eos> Well, you're still trapped, wherever you are, and I don't know how you're gonna escape.<eos> I mean, we got rid of the Philosopher's Stone.<eos> Did we?<eos> I am closer to my freedom than I have ever been.<eos> Every step, every move that you make, it only brings me nearer to it.
Did we?<eos> I am closer to my freedom than I have ever been.<eos> Every step, every move that you make, it only brings me nearer to it.<eos> I only need one more thing.<eos> Man, do you love to hear yourself talk.<eos> Iris, trying to show that you're not afraid?<eos> But I know you are.<eos> I'm sorry that you have to die.<eos> But it's you or me.<eos> And despite your feeble efforts to change the future, you can't, because I am the future, Flash.
- I'm beg...<eos> - Barry?<eos> You lose, Barry.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Iris?<eos> Iris, Iris.<eos> Look.<eos> Come on.<eos> What... what'd you see?
Hey.<eos> You okay?<eos> I'm worried.<eos> Yeah, I understand.<eos> I keep coming back to the thought that...<eos> I could be the cause of all this.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Savitar's prophecy.<eos> "One will betray you."<eos> You may well have invited Judas into the group, Caitlin.
You gonna run in there and run around till you find him?<eos> - It's endless.<eos> - I know.<eos> And this is the only way to save Wally.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I just... we need a plan.<eos> I... I...<eos> I don't wanna lose both my sons.<eos> Look, gang, I don't understand the Speed Force, but there are plenty of people in this room who do.<eos> Am I correct in assuming there's a point coming?<eos> My point is why can't you use your knowledge to fashion some kind of safety precaution for young BA right here, so that, while he's in the Speed Force, he doesn't get lost.
Good Lord, multiverses, breaches, halos, easy bloody peasy.<eos> By George, I think he's got it.<eos> Cisco, you about ready?<eos> Born ready.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here's winging it.<eos> Winging it?<eos> Wait, what do you mean?<eos> Well, I mean, I don't really have a map of the Speed Force, so when I vibe Barry into it...<eos> You have no idea where I'm gonna land.
- I don't think so.<eos> - Yeah, the one with the piano.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - The...<eos> Charlie Brown has the piano on my Earth.<eos> That's the whole gag 'cause he can't play the piano.<eos> - He's terrible.<eos> - No. Oh, my God, who cares about cats or pianos<eos> - or the freaking "Peanuts"? - It's not "The Peanuts." It's just "Peanuts."<eos> You have been studying this thing for hours. Can we or can we not use it to track Savitar?
Caitlin and Ronnie should've had that.<eos> A family, a future.<eos> The future doesn't always turn out as we want it to.<eos> I see what you're doing.<eos> First Eddie, now Ronnie, showing me all of the people who sacrificed themselves for the greater good.<eos> No, Barry, their sacrifices were for you, as was Wally's when he attempted to stop Savitar.<eos> No, Savitar tricked Wally.<eos> And now he's trapped.<eos> Wally doesn't belong in the Speed Force.<eos> You have to let me take his place.
Very well, but you were warned.<eos> Hunter Zolomon.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> - Is it Barry?<eos> - Did something happen to him?<eos> We don't know.<eos> One second, the telemetry was perfectly normal, and...<eos> Then his vitals, they just started crashing.<eos> We warned you.<eos> Why are you doing this?
Come on, come on.<eos> - Is it Barry?<eos> - Did something happen to him?<eos> We don't know.<eos> One second, the telemetry was perfectly normal, and...<eos> Then his vitals, they just started crashing.<eos> We warned you.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> You speak of sacrifice, yet you still let others bear the burdens that should be on your shoulders.<eos> Okay, okay, you're right.

See you soon, Flash.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Do you think you can reel them in?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I've never felt this much harmonic feedback.<eos> It feels like the Speed Force is about to...<eos> - Wally!<eos> - Barry!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Are you okay?
How long has she been like this?<eos> A few hours.<eos> Okay, we need to find whoever did this to Kara and punch him repeatedly until he reverses whatever spell he put on her, and I get to punch him first.<eos> Who are you exactly?<eos> My name is Mon-El.<eos> I'm Kara's... friend.<eos> We've been kissing a lot.<eos> Oh, she never mentioned she had a boyfriend.<eos> It's a recent thing, so...<eos> I thought you two broke up.
I mean, it could be a parallel dimension, or... maybe just some elaborate illusion.<eos> We just need to figure a way out.<eos> I guess I could click my heels together three times. - Yeah...<eos> - I was kidding.<eos> Okay, all right, well...<eos> Come on. Let's...<eos> You're a really good singer, by the way.<eos> Hey, thanks.<eos> My sister says I put the "Kara" in "karaoke."<eos> There you are!
- Who? - Who?<eos> Malcolm Merlyn. Former head of the League of Assassins.<eos> The what of the what?<eos> What the hell you talking about, kid?<eos> My name's Cutter Moran, I own this club, and both of you work for me.<eos> We what now?<eos> I pay you to sing, not pepper me with questions.<eos> And I hope you got something better in your songbook than what you were belting out up there, blondie.<eos> Hey! Don't call me blondie.<eos> Hey, look, I don't know who you are... obviously you're someone who's quick with a knife.
And nothing I've heard before.<eos> I want something original.<eos> Barry, I don't have my powers.<eos> Me neither.<eos> Winn!<eos> Winn, you're here too?<eos> Ah! Who's Winn?<eos> The name is Grady.<eos> I tickle the keys around here.<eos> Say, you realize how he got the nickname "Cutter," don't you?
Ah... Supergirl, I loved your rendition of "Moon River," such a beautiful song.<eos> You were a little flat in places, but I'm willing to let it slide just because you're so cute.<eos> - Hold on. What did you do to us?<eos> - Oh, nothing much.<eos> Just put a little song in your heart.<eos> Put a little...<eos> Why did you bring us here?<eos> I didn't bring you anywhere.<eos> We're inside your heads.<eos> You created this world.
I didn't tell you.<eos> I'm not really here.<eos> See, I'm out there in the real world.<eos> Central City's mine for the taking.<eos> - Ah. We're gonna stop you.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> You're welcome to try that.<eos> If you can get out of here.<eos> How do we get out of here?<eos> You're in a movie musical.
- Yeah!<eos> You're welcome to try that.<eos> If you can get out of here.<eos> How do we get out of here?<eos> You're in a movie musical.<eos> So all you have to do is just follow the...<eos> The Yellow Brick Road?<eos> No, the... the script.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> - Script... Reach the end of the plot, and, presto chango, you get to go home.

Reach the end of the plot, and, presto chango, you get to go home.<eos> One little detail, though, I should mention... if you die in here, you die out there.<eos> Lovely.<eos> I've reached my limit with magical creeps.<eos> In the meantime, I hope you're both ready to get the rust off those pipes of yours.
I'm not yelling.<eos> Wait, where are we?<eos> I don't know.<eos> All right, well, I'm sure everybody at S.T.A.R. Labs is working on getting us out of this.<eos> Yeah, I'm glad they brought me to your Earth.<eos> Mon-El seems like he really cares about you.<eos> Mon-El only cares about himself.<eos> He lied to me about who he really is - for nine months. - Hmm.<eos> I can't shake it.<eos> I thought it was gonna be something special like what you have with Iris.
Everything's so simple when I'm running.<eos> Or flying.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Both of you.<eos> Stein?<eos> Who... who's Stein?<eos> Right.<eos> - This them?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Do you know who I am?
Who... who's Stein?<eos> Right.<eos> - This them?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> Not Joe West, I'm guessing.<eos> Digsy.<eos> Digsy Foss.<eos> I run this town.<eos> So you're the mayor?
Digsy Foss.<eos> I run this town.<eos> So you're the mayor?<eos> The mayor may have gotten the vote... but I got the power.<eos> I got a situation... that you two are gonna help me with.<eos> - We would love to help you with it.<eos> - Really love to.<eos> My daughter, Millie... she's missing.<eos> Last she was seen, she was heading into Cutter Moran's place.<eos> Have you seen her in there?
We haven't seen her.<eos> I haven't seen her.<eos> - I haven't seen her.<eos> - Yeah, we...<eos> She's the only thing that is good and decent... about my life.<eos> If anything happened to her, this town will run red with blood.<eos> Starting with yours.<eos> We wouldn't want that, now, right?<eos> So, um, how can we help you?<eos> You two sing for Cutter.
Sounds like she's in trouble.<eos> Here, stand back, I'm gonna kick the door in.<eos> You stand back, I'll kick the door in.<eos> Well, I didn't mean, like, a gender thing.<eos> - I just wanted to kick it in...<eos> - Barry! All right, together. All right?<eos> - One, two...<eos> - Three!<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> All right, you caught us.
The guy who did this to them... I think he's stealing their powers.<eos> Power up.<eos> We gotta bring him in.<eos> No, not we... me.<eos> I'm the reason Barry got whammied.<eos> We win and we lose as a team. I'm coming with you.<eos> I'm coming too.<eos> Look, J'onn, uh, I respect this whole special agent situation you got going on, but this problem right here needs someone with... green skin and sick-ass cape.<eos> Call me the Martian Manhunter.<eos> I think you'll find that J'onn's a lot more than... just a pretty face.
Got it.<eos> This way.<eos> All right, J'onn, how do you feel about a little one-two combo?<eos> I'm gonna open a breach, you be ready to hit something really hard on the B-side.<eos> Hitting hard, I can do.<eos> Wally, get ready to do the same thing on the ground level.<eos> Copy.<eos> Now!<eos> Nighty-night.<eos> Hey, who are you?
Tommy Moran... is my home.<eos> And besides, if our geezers ever caught wind of this, they'd go to war.<eos> It'd be the end of more than just us, huh?<eos> Yeah, Tommy's right.<eos> Our fathers hate each other.<eos> Our love is forbidden.<eos> This is just like "West Side Story."<eos> I was thinking more "Fantasticks," but...<eos> Look, the point is... we ain't telling nobody nothing.<eos> And neither are you, capisce?
- Right? We're in a musical.<eos> So I think if we convince them to tell their fathers that they're in love, maybe that'll get us out of here.<eos> And back home to being... single, yay...<eos> At least we'll be single together.<eos> Has saying that ever made anyone feel better?<eos> Debatable.<eos> Okay, so look... your fathers aren't perfect, right?<eos> Love isn't perfect.<eos> No, but you can't let your love for somebody cause you to be afraid of what might happen.<eos> You gotta take the good with the bad, no matter what.
- Gee, thanks, kid. - Okay.<eos> - For you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Okay, uh... convincing people in musicals is... - ... really easy. - Yeah.<eos> Let's hope getting out of one is just as easy.<eos> Digsy!<eos> She's back!<eos> Thank God you're safe.<eos> Oh, of course I'm safe.<eos> Barry and Kara told me that you sent them to find me.
One look, and you can see that.<eos> And she wants to be with him.<eos> No matter how scared she was to tell you, no matter how dangerous it is to be with him, all that matters is, they're together.<eos> And when you find a love like that, well... you gotta hold on to it.<eos> No matter who's trying to stop you.<eos> That's clear to me now.<eos> I think you're being a little tough on your son.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Well, it's obvious why he didn't tell you right away.<eos> I mean, look at the way you're reacting.

- Thanks, Dad.<eos> - Come here.<eos> Get the boys.<eos> We are going to war.<eos> Well, well, well... if it isn't the two people<eos> I was hoping would visit me the most.<eos> Fix them. Now.<eos> I'm sorry. I can't.<eos> If you ever want to get out of that cell, that's exactly what you're gonna do.<eos> You don't get it.
You don't understand, big guy.<eos> That's just not how it works.<eos> My powers don't work that way. What do you mean?<eos> You're the one who did this to them.<eos> Yes, but... they are the only ones that are in control of what happens to them now, as are the two of you.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> How much... do you love him, Iris?<eos> And you, Mon-El, how much do you love her?<eos> So the question is: is that strong enough to save them?<eos> You want Kara and Barry back from the world they're in, you can go get them yourselves.
Love will find a way.<eos> You can do it.<eos> Power of love and all that.<eos> What do we do now?<eos> We got... we got Millie and Tommy to tell their fathers that they're in love.<eos> Which, I know we're in a musical and everything, but seeing Mon-El in love with someone else was...<eos> It was hard to watch. I know.<eos> Anyway, I mean, what are we... supposed to do?<eos> What do you think this... Music Meister needs us to do now?<eos> Ah, there you are!
It was hard to watch. I know.<eos> Anyway, I mean, what are we... supposed to do?<eos> What do you think this... Music Meister needs us to do now?<eos> Ah, there you are!<eos> You two ready?<eos> Ready for...<eos> For rehearsal, you dolt.<eos> Mr. Moran told me that you got more songs in your repertoire. - Ah.<eos> - We have to finish the musical. - Yeah.<eos> - Uh, do you... do you happen to know anything original?
Gypsy.<eos> Still seeking revenge, I see.<eos> I'm gonna get it this time.<eos> We'll see.<eos> No!<eos> He calls himself Abra Kadabra.<eos> As in hocus pocus?<eos> He's certainly got a lot of tricks.<eos> Yeah, we think he has some sort of nanotechnology built into his body... allows him to do some extraordinary feats.<eos> Teleportation, telekinesis, you name it, and believe me, I have seen it all.
Everybody okay?<eos> Magic or tech, doesn't matter. You're not getting out of these.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> You let me go, I will tell you Savitar's greatest secret.<eos> It's the key to defeating him, the key to stopping him.<eos> - What secret?<eos> - I know who he is.<eos> I know his name.<eos> Hand him over!<eos> Why'd you lock him up?
I know everything about the God of Speed, hallowed be his name.<eos> Like what?<eos> That he's unstoppable, that he was the first speedster, and that you defeat him, but not until after he takes what matters the most to you...<eos> Iris West.<eos> Tell us who he is, now!<eos> I don't think so.<eos> It's frustrating, isn't it, knowing that you're going to die unless I give The Flash what he wants.<eos> All that power, all that speed, and yet you're still too slow.<eos> This isn't a game or a trick. This is about my daughter's life.<eos> And it's my life if you hand me over to that collector.
Time to go home.<eos> Bar, he opened up another wormhole!<eos> Yes!<eos> He did it, he got him.<eos> Thank God.<eos> So much for your disappearing act.<eos> No!<eos> By the laws of Earth-19, I hereby collect you for the crime of mass murder.<eos> Let her take me.<eos> You'll never find out what I know.

- Yeah.<eos> Oh, probably should've made that out of carbyne.<eos> Rookie mistake.<eos> You do not want to hurt me, Caitlin.<eos> You know, you probably should've spent a little more time finding a cure for what ails me.<eos> I care about you, Caitlin.<eos> Show me.<eos> - Julian!<eos> - Come on, come on!<eos> Oh, boys... where are you?
I'm so sorry I did this to you.<eos> I should have saved you.<eos> I'm glad that you did this to me.<eos> Caitlin wasn't.<eos> I failed her.<eos> But I won't when I go back.<eos> I'm gonna find you.<eos> And I'm gonna help you.<eos> You're no match for the God of Speed.<eos> You didn't tell him, did you?
Tell me who he is.<eos> I'll never tell.<eos> You are gonna be so surprised when you find out.<eos> You know, I think your protégé went toe-to-toe with Savitar.<eos> Maybe he can help you out.<eos> I need to see Wally.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi, um, I'm looking for Wally West?<eos> I recognize you from Joe's photos.<eos> - You're Barry, right?
Oh, it's you again.<eos> Bar?<eos> You... you look...<eos> Young?<eos> He's from the past, Detective.<eos> 2017, to be precise.<eos> I knew something felt weird in the cemetery.<eos> You hadn't visited Iris in years.<eos> Yeah, that's what I've heard.<eos> Cisco told me, or showed me, that you all haven't been a team in a long time.
Give me that thing in your hands.<eos> The other thing.<eos> That makes more sense.<eos> I can rejigger this to mimic the resonance fields from Scudder's portals, make it so Barry can manipulate the mirrors.<eos> - But what about Top? - This will also restore whatever rarefaction effect she's causing.<eos> Yes, that's good.<eos> That's brilliant.<eos> But without opening another breach, how can we possibly get it into his hands in time?<eos> I'll take it to him.<eos> I saw what you were doing from the time vault.
I heard what you said.<eos> And you were right.<eos> Iris wouldn't have wanted this.<eos> She would have wanted us to stay a family.<eos> I broke that promise to her... to all of you.<eos> You made me realize, even though Savitar's gone,<eos> I've...<eos> I've still been letting him win.<eos> I was wrong to do that.<eos> If you're all willing to... try to be a family again...
If the answers that we need to stop Savitar and save you are in the future, then that's where I need to go.<eos> You're from before she dies, aren't you?<eos> You trapped Savitar in the Speed Force.<eos> Just tell me how you did it.<eos> I had help.<eos> Her name's Tracy Brown.<eos> She made the Speed Force trap for me.<eos> You're telling me my ideas about the Speed Force...
This is for your brain, okay?<eos> I want to stop you from making new memories.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Savitar knows everything we're gonna do because he remembers doing it.<eos> He's a future Barry.<eos> So... what if Barry can't remember what we're doing now?<eos> You want to mess with his brain?<eos> Just a little bit.<eos> It's a minimal procedure.<eos> It'll still be the same Barry you know and love, except he just won't be able to retain new information.
Slight wouldn't be a word I'd use.<eos> Where the hell am I?<eos> Is this a dentist office?<eos> No, no.<eos> This is S.T.A.R. Labs.<eos> St...<eos> Labs?<eos> A laboratory?<eos> St... a laboratory?<eos> What are you?
- Bart's kinda cool.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Wally!<eos> Okay, hey. Let's just get you back in the chair.<eos> No!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I'm not...<eos> - I'm not getting in the chair.<eos> - Just get in the chair...<eos> No, how do I know you didn't kidnap me here to do some weird brain surgery on me?
- Okay.<eos> - Wally!<eos> Okay, hey. Let's just get you back in the chair.<eos> No!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I'm not...<eos> - I'm not getting in the chair.<eos> - Just get in the chair...<eos> No, how do I know you didn't kidnap me here to do some weird brain surgery on me?<eos> Or maybe you're like those criminals who trick people into hotel rooms so they can steal their kidneys.
Okay, we are not flipping any more switches - until we figure this thing out. - [cell phone vibrates]<eos> It's Cecile.<eos> Hey, babe.<eos> An emergency?<eos> All right, bye.<eos> Okay, Cecile needs Barry at CCPD, like, right now.<eos> She says it's urgent.<eos> He can't possibly go out in that condition.<eos> Okay, um, my dad and I will take Barry to Cecile.<eos> You and Cisco figure out a way to get Barry's memory back.
I wear glasses?<eos> You will now.<eos> Just put 'em on.<eos> - You'll be okay.<eos> - Just don't get them wet.<eos> - [clears throat] Your Honor, I, uh...<eos> - What? Wh...<eos> I call Barry Allen to the stand.<eos> Raise your right hand, please.<eos> You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
I call Barry Allen to the stand.<eos> Raise your right hand, please.<eos> You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do, yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Miss Horton?<eos> - Mr. Allen...<eos> - Can I sit?<eos> Please, just...<eos> You are a crime scene investigator for the Central City police department, correct?

[clears throat]<eos> Uh, yes, I am a CSI at the CCPD under the expert direction of Julian Albert.<eos> Smiley face.<eos> Want to cut it out with the emojis?<eos> Mr. Allen, can you tell me... in your expert opinion, what substance do you see in this photograph?
Mr. Allen, are you all right?<eos> Yes, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I just, um... it's getting hot in here.<eos> What else is unique about shellac flakes?<eos> It's the fire accelerant used in all of the arson cases associated with Heat Monger.<eos> [scoffs] Such an embarrassing name.<eos> I like it.<eos> I think it's great.<eos> And how would you know when shellac flakes have been used?

Are you like a super villain?<eos> Just asking.<eos> Okay.<eos> How did this happen?<eos> You got rid of Barry's memories.<eos> What Barry remembers, Savitar remembers.<eos> So Savitar's lost his memories too?<eos> Savitar loses his memory, he doesn't go along with the plan to give Wally powers.<eos> Cause and effect.<eos> But if you let me help you figure out how to get Barry's memories back, everything goes back to the way it was.
If Savitar gets his memory back, what's in it for you?<eos> That's my business.<eos> You think that Barry can become The Flash?<eos> Yeah. He can learn.<eos> I still know how to do everything.<eos> I can teach him.<eos> Okay.<eos> Maybe this is how you defeat Savitar.<eos> But there's still a lot of villains in this city, and no Flashes to protect it.<eos> Is that really a chance you're willing to take?
What do you mean?<eos> That freedom? I had that.<eos> When I was with my mom and dad again in Flashpoint, and I could've let it stay like that.<eos> I could've let the memories of this timeline fade, but... if I'd done that, I would've lost Joe, and Cisco, and Wally, and Caitlin, and you.<eos> Pain and darkness... it's a part of me.<eos> You know, I need it to fuel me, to push me to be a better person, to be a better hero.<eos> To keep me from ever forgetting who I am.<eos> Now that... is the Barry Allen I know and love.<eos> Hey, you guys... okay!<eos> You guys, you got to come see this.

Tonight.<eos> I'm sorry, Barry.<eos> I can't help you this time.<eos> You'll have to find another way.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, if Lyla won't let us have the Dominators' tech, then we are gonna break into ARGUS, and we're gonna steal it.<eos> Wally and I will phase through the walls.<eos> We'll be in and out of there before anyone even gets off a shot.<eos> Uh, hello? No, you won't.

No, you won't.<eos> - Yeah, we...<eos> - What is that?<eos> That is a meta-human power dampener.<eos> And it's all over the building, so you can't use your powers inside.
I thought he was with the Legends.<eos> - He is.<eos> - No, he dead.<eos> - Well...<eos> Yeah. - You time-traveled again?<eos> That's what got us in this mess in the first place.<eos> I thought you said you would never do that again.<eos> I also said I would do whatever it takes to save you.<eos> That hasn't changed.<eos> And I'm pretty sure you all feel the same way, too.
Power source?<eos> For what?<eos> Oh... it doesn't matter.<eos> - Well, should I stop them?<eos> - No.<eos> Let them take it.<eos> No speed gun can stop a god.<eos> My guess is the power source is most likely here.<eos> Why there?<eos> Because it's the deepest part of the facility, and if it's as valuable as you say it is, then the deepest recesses of any facility are usually the most secure.
I'm gonna keep hackin' away and find out for sure.<eos> Do you have any idea what else might be down there?<eos> Don't matter.<eos> There are only four rules you need to remember.<eos> Make the plan, execute the plan, expect the plan to go off the rails... throw away the plan.<eos> Follow my lead and you'll be fine.<eos> I'm trusting you.<eos> We all are.<eos> Just don't sit me at the single's table at the wedding reception.<eos> Just out of curiosity, you have a plan for getting in there?
Iris.<eos> What brings you folk to this section of the multiverse?<eos> What's that?<eos> It's how much time we have left.<eos> Before what?<eos> Before we lose.<eos> We're prepping the chopper for San Francisco now.<eos> Copy that, sir...<eos> Director Michaels.<eos> I thought you were en route to San Francisco.
I've loaded the power source into the device, which should deliver the necessary amount of energy to trap Savitar in the speed force.<eos> We'll be on standby in case it fails.<eos> It won't fail.<eos> It won't fail.<eos> It's ready.<eos> You didn't have that the last time, - so we have the upper hand now. - Mm-hmm.<eos> All right.<eos> You guys figure out what your plan is.<eos> I can't be here to know any of it.<eos> You know where I'll be.
- I didn't help.<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> - You inspired her.<eos> - I didn't inspire her.<eos> I...<eos> I didn't do anything inspiring.<eos> You know what's inspiring?<eos> Barry.<eos> A hero among heroes.<eos> You're all heroes.
- Yes, you did.<eos> - You inspired her.<eos> - I didn't inspire her.<eos> I...<eos> I didn't do anything inspiring.<eos> You know what's inspiring?<eos> Barry.<eos> A hero among heroes.<eos> You're all heroes.<eos> And you've all given me so... so much, you know?

You've literally never said that before.<eos> Anyway, since he got this new job,<eos> - he's been difficult.<eos> Full of himself.<eos> - Okay. He's just jealous because I'm better at finding new clients.<eos> For instance.<eos> Who would you say is the worst person in this room?<eos> Huh?<eos> Meg or Elizabeth?<eos> You both have said some pretty awful things.
In his journal. Georgie had it in her car.<eos> Seems our dead guy, Harvey, was friends with the sirens, back in 1790.<eos> They lured him into the Armory tunnels, and he starved to death down there.<eos> We found his bones a couple months ago. DNA results got back yesterday.<eos> Oh!<eos> - Awesome.<eos> - Yeah. Turns out, he was related to a family from Mystic Falls.<eos> And through the magic that is the Internet, I've tracked down a living descendant.<eos> He's here to claim the remains.<eos> Hey, Mr. Maxwell. Did you finish signing those forms?
We all do.<eos> Everyone loves her. Good morning, everyone.<eos> Good morning, Miss Sybil.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Well, yesterday, we finished the Revolutionary War so today we're gonna start on the 1800s.<eos> No. I mean, why are you masquerading<eos> - as a history teacher?<eos> - I'm not masquerading.<eos> I give a lot of homework. And pop quizzes, right?<eos> You're the best teacher at this school.
And in answer to your question,<eos> I want to teach you history.<eos> Why else would I have told your boss to send you here on an assignment?<eos> The news assignment came from you.<eos> I just said that. You mustn't have beenbe very good student.<eos> We're gonna have to try to remedy that.<eos> Students, please turn to chapter three.<eos> "Antebellum Virginia."<eos> Ms. Forbes?<eos> You can take a seat.
"Hey, sissy.<eos> "Looking for something?<eos> Seline."<eos> Now I know why she kept organizing my house.<eos> I'm suddenly feeling the need to vent.<eos> Here, go.<eos> Matt, look out!<eos> Go, go, go, go!<eos> It's okay.<eos> You finished your assignment.
- A wise animated cat.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> Hi. I am looking for Andy Kleinberg.<eos> Do you know where he is?<eos> Don't waste your time with him.<eos> Let me get you a drink.<eos> Keep it in your pants, Tommy Bahama.<eos> She's spoken for, thank you.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> So do you know where Andy is?
Don't waste your time with him.<eos> Let me get you a drink.<eos> Keep it in your pants, Tommy Bahama.<eos> She's spoken for, thank you.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> So do you know where Andy is?<eos> Your loss.<eos> Oh. Thank you.<eos> Andy Kleinberg?<eos> You're blocking my view.
No, I'm not.<eos> So do you know where Andy is?<eos> Your loss.<eos> Oh. Thank you.<eos> Andy Kleinberg?<eos> You're blocking my view.<eos> The view from a jail cell sucks, too.<eos> What, is this a joke?<eos> Wait, is this one of George's pranks to get me back for that stripper?<eos> Hey, are you a stripper?
Andy Kleinberg?<eos> You're blocking my view.<eos> The view from a jail cell sucks, too.<eos> What, is this a joke?<eos> Wait, is this one of George's pranks to get me back for that stripper?<eos> Hey, are you a stripper?<eos> I'd recommend you stop talking now.<eos> Jana Lawrence was found murdered this morning.<eos> She was my stewardess on my flight yesterday.<eos> So? So you sent her a threatening text.
Booties call me.<eos> Sometimes.<eos> Look, is there anyone who can prove you not having sex?<eos> Oh, I had sex.<eos> Meet Sharon.<eos> Hey, Lucifer.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> She can attest to my whereabouts all night long.<eos> And she can, too.<eos> Now... if you'll excuse me, I'd like to go somewhere where you two are not.
Right, where to, then?<eos> There's been another murder.<eos> Ballistics match our flight attendant.<eos> The victim was in the shower when he was killed.<eos> Signs of a struggle.<eos> Looks like he was tortured, too.<eos> So Jana's killer had it in for this poor chap as well, did they?<eos> On the upside, looks like he didn't have anything to do with this case after all.<eos> Pretty sure you didn't sleep with this guy.<eos> Uh, actually, you're wrong about that, Detective.
"Do I make you horny, honey?"<eos> with some Vaseline and a car battery.<eos> - What?<eos> - That was a move I call,<eos> "Gentlemen, start your engines."<eos> It's bloody brilliant.<eos> Did you and Lucifer have any intimate moments?<eos> Obviously, we were intimate.<eos> We were hella intimate. Mm!<eos> Did you not hear about the honey?
Wait a minute, why is she here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I keep telling the detective she's not my ex.<eos> I wanted to tell you that you impressed me<eos> Really?<eos> - Yeah. - Mm.<eos> I underestimated you.<eos> I gave you all the reason in the world to betray Lucifer.<eos> You did.<eos> During that case you went to incredible lengths to hurt Lucifer.
I gave you all the reason in the world to betray Lucifer.<eos> You did.<eos> During that case you went to incredible lengths to hurt Lucifer.<eos> I did nothing of the sort.<eos> You took that case just to try and get me to call Lucifer a liar in court.<eos> True, but I would never hurt Lucifer.<eos> I was trying to prove that you weren't worthy of him.<eos> I see.<eos> What about the other women that you don't think are worthy of him?<eos> What'd you do to them?
Nothing.<eos> They are inconsequential.<eos> You're different.<eos> He's different when he's with you.<eos> Does that threaten you?<eos> Perhaps at first. Not anymore.<eos> It makes me happy.<eos> I'm glad he found someone.<eos> He deserves a woman like you in his life.<eos> Have you slept with him yet?

Demon.<eos> You just need to realize it for yourself.<eos> Not because I said it.<eos> You're saying I'm awesome.<eos> I'm saying that you need to say that you're awesome.<eos> Believe that you're awesome.<eos> Yes, you're awesome.<eos> Hell yeah I am.<eos> Thanks, Doc.<eos> Do you notice anything out of the ordinary?
Thanks, Doc.<eos> Do you notice anything out of the ordinary?<eos> Did anyone threaten you?<eos> I mean, there was that one girl.<eos> What girl?<eos> The creepy weirdo.<eos> She was always in a corner of the club.<eos> She just gave this death stare.<eos> Daggers.<eos> Okay, can you give me a description?
I'm just... really into Lucifer.<eos> And who could blame you.<eos> You're my perfect man.<eos> Like porn and stuffed crust pizza and my Hello Kitty blankie all rolled into one.<eos> I've loved you from afar.<eos> Right.<eos> I see what's happened here.<eos> Not having sex with me drove her into a murderous, psychotic rage.<eos> Murder?<eos> What are you talking about?
You're gonna get us killed!<eos> No, I'm gonna catch our killer, Detective.<eos> Better hold on!<eos> Hey.<eos> Better hold on.<eos> Lucifer!<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Captain Pickman, LAPD!<eos> Oh, thank God!<eos> You're a cop.
No, I'm gonna catch our killer, Detective.<eos> Better hold on!<eos> Hey.<eos> Better hold on.<eos> Lucifer!<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Captain Pickman, LAPD!<eos> Oh, thank God!<eos> You're a cop.<eos> I was afraid you were trying to kill me.
Hey.<eos> Better hold on.<eos> Lucifer!<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Captain Pickman, LAPD!<eos> Oh, thank God!<eos> You're a cop.<eos> I was afraid you were trying to kill me.<eos> What?<eos> So, care to explain why you were trying to flee the country?
You're a cop.<eos> I was afraid you were trying to kill me.<eos> What?<eos> So, care to explain why you were trying to flee the country?<eos> My two closest friends just got murdered.<eos> I thought I might be next and I was not about to stick around to find out.<eos> Who would try to kill you, Tim?<eos> I only know him as "Burt."<eos> Guy smuggles a lot of drugs into the country.<eos> So, were you moving product for him?

Yes, and it would need to be someone who might have worked with Jana.<eos> Hmm. Uh, Tim, who else was on the flight?<eos> Just me,<eos> Andy Kleinberg, my copilot, and a new flight attendant.<eos> A new flight attendant?<eos> So Burt may not have known what she looked like?<eos> I'm in.<eos> Okay, but you understand what you're agreeing to, right?<eos> Sure.<eos> You want me to bounty hunt this Burt scumbag and pretend to deliver his package.
Two vodkas, please.<eos> Peacock has landed.<eos> Okay.<eos> Any sign of Burt?<eos> Not yet, but I'll stick around until someone approaches.<eos> What?<eos> I think I just figured out what's wrong with you.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> And what would that be, Maze?<eos> You need to own up to what you did.
My priority right now is this case.<eos> Okay?<eos> So, just... step outside and get some air.<eos> I don't need air.<eos> Well, I do.<eos> Right.<eos> Understood.<eos> A man just entered the bar.<eos> Got you.<eos> You are one of the prettiest flight attendants I've ever seen.
Well, I do.<eos> Right.<eos> Understood.<eos> A man just entered the bar.<eos> Got you.<eos> You are one of the prettiest flight attendants I've ever seen.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - I'm Burt.<eos> Hi, Burt.<eos> You ready for takeoff?
I'm sorry.<eos> Hey.<eos> About what you heard in the van...<eos> Hey, it doesn't matter... except something still bothers me.<eos> Burt went to a lot of trouble for a single drug deal.<eos> Yeah, well... the guy had a reputation to protect.<eos> You know? One person steals from him, everyone else thinks they can, too.<eos> All right.<eos> But then who has the package?<eos> How... how did you find me?
Previously on Lucifer...<eos> Tell me, what do you desire?<eos> This is it?<eos> This is your big trick?<eos> Why don't I affect you, Detective?<eos> I guess we both have our mysteries.<eos> 35 years ago, Father asked me to come down here to bless a couple who was unable to have a child.<eos> You look really familiar.
I've decided to take things slow, for once.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Because I'm a responsible Devil.<eos> And I... well, I know what a big deal the kiss was... for the detective.<eos> For her?<eos> Well, I'm sure it must have made quite an impact on her.<eos> I mean, it, it is me.<eos> No doubt she's overwhelmed by emotions she's never felt before.<eos> She's overwhelmed?<eos> Is that why you went your separate ways after the kiss?
Y-You do?<eos> You're stalling, Lucifer.<eos> Stalling?<eos> Sex?<eos> Me?<eos> Doctor, have we even met before?<eos> You're stalling because you've realized how complicated your relationship is.<eos> Look... the, um, the truth is that...<eos> I still don't understand why, after everything I said about my less positive qualities, she still chose to kiss me.<eos> I mean, do you think she's ill?
Enjoying what little life he had left with sex or friends.<eos> Or sex with friends.<eos> I just figured that's where you were going with that.<eos> Yeah, well, I mean, I don't know how down he was to party, but, you guys, I've seen a lot of messed up stuff.<eos> This toxin tore through his body like it was burning him from the inside out.<eos> I mean, I'm gonna have to reach out to my forensic contacts just to see if anyone knows anything.<eos> Who found the body?<eos> I thought he was just sleeping it off for once.<eos> I didn't realize he was freakin' dead.<eos> Do you know anyone who may have had a problem with him?

Is he dead?<eos> - Is he dead?<eos> - Freeze.<eos> Drop the knife.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> He's dead because of me.<eos> Put down the knife, Johnny.<eos> Yes, listen to her, Johnny.<eos> She's quite a good shot.<eos> You don't understand!
It's my fault.<eos> He's dead because of me.<eos> Put down the knife, Johnny.<eos> Yes, listen to her, Johnny.<eos> She's quite a good shot.<eos> You don't understand!<eos> I couldn't do what the man said.<eos> What man?<eos> The man said he would kill that kid if I didn't cut my face.<eos> Mr. Johnny Kane, you're an amazing actor with an impressive library of films under your belt.

Beloved by critics and the public alike.<eos> Many would say you're at the top of your profession right now.<eos> Which is why it'll be so interesting to see what decision you make for this experiment.<eos> You can either... carve up your own face, or...<eos> Rick Cormier, an innocent freshman at Malibu State, will die of poisoning.<eos> You have 24 hours to decide.<eos> Do what's asked and an antidote will be delivered.<eos> The choice is yours alone.<eos> Well, that's dramatic.<eos> When did you get this video?
The choice is yours alone.<eos> Well, that's dramatic.<eos> When did you get this video?<eos> Yesterday.<eos> At first,<eos> I thought it was some sick joke.<eos> Fans send bizarre letters to my manager all the time, but this was sent directly to my personal e-mail, and it was so... disturbing.<eos> I couldn't get it out of my head.<eos> - I had to check it out.<eos> - So you went to the school.
I thought it was some sick joke.<eos> Fans send bizarre letters to my manager all the time, but this was sent directly to my personal e-mail, and it was so... disturbing.<eos> I couldn't get it out of my head.<eos> - I had to check it out.<eos> - So you went to the school.<eos> Yeah, when I realized that this kid was a real student at Malibu, I... I started thinking that this "experiment" might be real, too.<eos> I went home and I stared at that knife for hours.<eos> But I couldn't do it.<eos> I couldn't cut up my face.<eos> Well, of course you couldn't.
That's an impossible choice.<eos> This killer is clearly playing God.<eos> I mean, no one would do something like that unless they're being manipulated.<eos> Not unlike someone showing affection when it made no logical sense.<eos> What?<eos> I mean, what kind of sick bastard would do such a thing?<eos> That's exactly what I'd like to know.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Okay, look, we are doing everything we can to trace that e-mail, but in the meantime, did you have any connection to the poisoned student?
- No, raise your hands above your head where we can see them.<eos> - Well, it might be a gun, Detective.<eos> - It's not a gun.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Just...<eos> I don't know any kid...<eos> Better safe than sorry.<eos> Right.<eos> Look, I don't know what you're talking about.
But it wasn't me.<eos> Do they ever get less predictable?<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> It must've been hacked.<eos> I didn't send that e-mail, and I didn't send this one either.<eos> - What other one?<eos> - This one, sent an hour ago.<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> Dr. Gwendolyn Scott.<eos> You're a world-renowned thoracic surgeon.

Right. Shall we?<eos> These are the future leaders of America, Detective, engaging in sex, drugs, and lecherous behavior.<eos> Makes me proud.<eos> All right, well, don't get too comfortable.<eos> Remember, we're not here to party, we're here to find Ashley.<eos> And she could be sick already, so let's split up and we'll cover more ground that way.<eos> Right.<eos> Find the girl, don't have fun. Check.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Excuse me, have you seen this girl?

Check.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Excuse me, have you seen this girl?<eos> I think I saw her an hour ago.<eos> - She's, like, way hot.<eos> - Yeah, great.<eos> Do you know where she is?
'Cause she might be in danger.<eos> Danger of getting wasted!<eos> Whoo!<eos> Ashley Corbett?<eos> Anyone seen Ashley Corbett?<eos> Ashley Corbett?<eos> No...<eos> - Hello.<eos> Hi. - Hi.<eos> Right, yes, you're all very lovely.
Hi. - Hi.<eos> Right, yes, you're all very lovely.<eos> Very lovely.<eos> Dear, how do I turn this thing off?<eos> I'm looking for Ashley Corbett.<eos> Can you tell me where she is?<eos> We'll tell you.<eos> But first you have to do something for us.<eos> We are almost through, Dr. Scott.<eos> I really appreciate you answering our questions.
We'll tell you.<eos> But first you have to do something for us.<eos> We are almost through, Dr. Scott.<eos> I really appreciate you answering our questions.<eos> Probably should've called you when I got the e-mail.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> It's okay, Doctor.<eos> We're here now.<eos> Can I ask you something, Detective?<eos> What would you do?

But what if they can't?<eos> They will find her.<eos> I promise you.<eos> Some of our best people are on it.<eos> Right.<eos> Now, can you please tell me where Ashley is?<eos> Come with me.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Hey...<eos> Was that an earthquake, or did you just rock my world?
Now, can you please tell me where Ashley is?<eos> Come with me.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Hey...<eos> Was that an earthquake, or did you just rock my world?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> You got a boyfriend or something?<eos> Definitely not.<eos> Now, I suppose what I'm saying is, you know, how do I know that it's real?<eos> It's real if you're two halves of a whole.

So, this is where the... healing happens.<eos> It's cute.<eos> So, what brings you here?<eos> I have some upsetting information to give to Lucifer.<eos> It's a revelation that might send him over the edge against his Father.<eos> Okay.<eos> But considering that Lucifer and I have a bumpy track record, I'm afraid he won't believe me.<eos> I'm afraid he might think I have some... ulterior motive.<eos> Do you?<eos> I'm not going to tell him this information for you, if that's what you're asking.

You're very... tall.<eos> And most certainly quite powerful.<eos> But my loyalties are to my patient, your son.<eos> Doctor-Devil confidentiality.<eos> But I'm not asking you to break his trust.<eos> In fact, I'm asking you to illuminate the truth for him.<eos> If he's going to make an informed decision about Chlo... about his future here, he needs to know the facts.<eos> Right?<eos> I said please, right?<eos> If this information is as upsetting as you're making it out to be, I'm not interested in being the messenger.

But the poison must be different from the first victim.<eos> The antidote they made, it's... it's useless.<eos> But don't worry, we will figure out a way. We always do.<eos> It just takes time.<eos> Okay?<eos> I, um...<eos> I need to get a glass of water.<eos> This is Espinoza.<eos> I need to get an update on Ashley Corbett.<eos> I'm sorry. Can you say that again?
- Okay.<eos> - We never found it.<eos> It had to be the poison.<eos> Kleinberg must've been the one who stole it.<eos> And look what happened to him.<eos> This is the other student that was poisoned?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't recognize him.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We just need to ask you these questions now that you're feeling better.
With a link.<eos> Hello, Detective.<eos> You don't need that mask anymore, Professor Carlisle.<eos> So much easier to breathe without that thing.<eos> What do you want, Professor?<eos> To finish my experiment without interference, but here we are...<eos> Your experiment failed, Professor.<eos> We proved your theory wrong.<eos> The doctor chose to save the girl.<eos> So, clearly, not everyone's as egregiously selfish as you are.
It was about instinct, but thank you for reminding me why I'm doing this and for helping me to improve upon my experiment.<eos> Truth is, Dr. Scott only mutilated her hand because she was being observed by you.<eos> So this time I'm controlling my variables.<eos> Meet...<eos> Benjamin Tibi.<eos> Innocent student, attached to a poison drip.<eos> And here, Leon Klem, accomplished track star, stuck in a vice.<eos> If Leon simply pulls the lever and severs his leg within 60 minutes,<eos> Benji here gets... this.<eos> You guessed it.
School mascot maybe?<eos> We checked every lab at Malibu State.<eos> Well, he wouldn't go back there, would he?<eos> Trust me, when you get kicked out of a fancy party, the last thing you want to do is sneak back in.<eos> You do the opposite.<eos> Who's Malibu's closest rival?<eos> The lab in here is closed for renovation, so maybe he's here.<eos> Well, well, isn't this a surprise.<eos> It's locked, Detective.<eos> But with that said, I'm actually glad you made it.

You decide what's more important.
Go!<eos> Freeze!<eos> Right.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come on, Detective, a bit of help here!<eos> I need you further away.<eos> Freeze!<eos> There's nowhere left to run, Professor.<eos> Lovely.<eos> I knew you'd save yourself.
Freeze!<eos> Right.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come on, Detective, a bit of help here!<eos> I need you further away.<eos> Freeze!<eos> There's nowhere left to run, Professor.<eos> Lovely.<eos> I knew you'd save yourself.<eos> It was the only choice you could make.

What if he doesn't come?<eos> If he said he'll be here, he'll be here.<eos> Mazikeen!<eos> Interesting choice of venue.<eos> My, my, how the tide has turned.<eos> What's this, celestial enemies' night out?<eos> Why don't you have a seat, Lucifer.<eos> There's something that we need to tell you.<eos> Ooh, some sort of supernatural intervention, is it?<eos> Well, doesn't matter what shenanigans you two have got cooking up, 'cause, quite frankly, I'm too happy for you to spoil things.
Previously on Lucifer...<eos> Uriel didn't just die.<eos> I killed him.<eos> Where's Uriel?<eos> Oh. You look really familiar.
Freeze!<eos> We are talking designer poison, here.<eos> So, how do we get an antidote?<eos> Well, that right there is the tricky part.<eos> Designer poisons need designer antidotes.<eos> Detective!<eos> It won't stop.<eos> Lucifer.<eos> The bleeding stopped. You don't have to drive like a maniac.<eos> You've forgotten you've been poisoned, Detective, or has it already reached your brain?
Everything's gonna be fine once we get to the hospital.<eos> Okay?<eos> We can't go to the hospital.<eos> What? Lucifer, going to the hospital didn't help any of the other victims.<eos> The only thing that's gonna save my life is finding the antidote.<eos> Otherwise, I'm...<eos> All right.<eos> All right, very well.<eos> No judgments, guys, okay?<eos> You said come right away, so I came right away.
Then you... you can't help her.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> There you are.<eos> I've been looking all over for you.<eos> Amenadiel.<eos> Give us a minute.<eos> I... have an idea.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Okay, so the professor's been using this Burt guy to smuggle in the poisons.<eos> What, so you think that Burt might have smuggled the antidotes as well? Yes.
My word is my bond.<eos> Dave Maddox?<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Just one moment, all right?<eos> No, it's urgent.<eos> It's about your other business.<eos> Specifically, with Professor Jason Carlisle.<eos> Help us get the professor's antidote, and we'll get out of your children's art festival.<eos> Can you just... give me one minute? Yeah.<eos> I... have no idea what you're talking about.
Well, what about the formula?<eos> What about it?<eos> We need to know the amounts of each ingredient he used.<eos> If we get it wrong, it could be lethal.<eos> The professor kept the formula all to himself.<eos> He liked to brag about how the only place it existed was in his head.<eos> You'd... you'd have to ask him.<eos> Yeah, well, we can't do that.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Um... you still want the painting though, right?
Well, I'm glad I was able to comfort you.<eos> No, no, Mum, you figured it out. How I'm gonna save the detective.<eos> Um, I'm not sure I understand.<eos> I'm gonna pop down to Hell and have a chat with the professor.<eos> What?<eos> How?<eos> Well, it's simple.<eos> All I need to do is die.<eos> The plan is simple:<eos> you kill me, I go down to Hell, interrogate the professor, get the formula and then you bring me back.
Right, so one zap of this doohickey will stop my heart?<eos> Uh, the defibrillator wasn't made for that, but yes.<eos> Not what I thought I'd be doing with my day.<eos> I'm gonna give you 60 seconds, then restart your heart to bring you back.<eos> 60 seconds?<eos> I've had orgasms that last longer.<eos> Time moves much slower down there.<eos> Remember?<eos> Yes, but we only get one shot at this.<eos> What if you yank me out before I get the formula?
Hey!<eos> Help!<eos> Coward.<eos> No. Killer.<eos> No.<eos> Murderer.<eos> Monster. No...<eos> Killer.<eos> Coward!<eos> No, you don't understand.
What is this?<eos> This is a torture of your own making.<eos> Fueled by guilt.<eos> With a little bit of flair thrown in for fun.<eos> Please.<eos> I need to get out of here.<eos> How do I get out?<eos> Well, it's quite simple, you can't.<eos> What?<eos> Not until you no longer believe you deserve it.
What?<eos> Not until you no longer believe you deserve it.<eos> And I have never seen anyone pull themselves out of here.<eos> Oh, God, no, no, no.<eos> No, no...<eos> However, perhaps making some amends for your misdeeds might do the trick.<eos> Anything.<eos> Please.<eos> How do I make amends?<eos> Well, before you so rudely ended your own life, you poisoned a detective.
"Cat burglars"?<eos> What are you, an old-timey desperado?<eos> I'm just saying we're a little out of our element.<eos> Speak for yourself.<eos> Yeah, I noticed.<eos> Where'd you learn to pick a lock like that?<eos> My grandma.<eos> And what exactly are we looking for again?<eos> Hey!<eos> You picked the wrong place to rob.
Lucifer...<eos> No, please.<eos> Shh. Uriel!<eos> My sweet boy!<eos> - He's not real.<eos> - Lucifer!<eos> My sweet boy.<eos> Well.<eos> Look who's back.<eos> You didn't die after all.
That's it. That's it.<eos> That's everything.<eos> Look, your father's not to hear anything we are creating here, you got that?<eos> You erase these drives every night, Jamal.<eos> Hear me? Got you.<eos> Okay. Yeah, that's in the pocket.<eos> Y'all keep creating.<eos> Play that funky music, white girl.<eos> Dwight broke his promise.<eos> Ms. Leah, what are you doing here?
And I cleaned up after you... that's what I do.<eos> I clean up after all of y'all.<eos> Yeah, you better have.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> I hope so.<eos> It's the last couple of polls.<eos> What, you trying to scratch your way back into the damn race?<eos> See, you had to scratch your way to power.<eos> See, I was born with mine.<eos> And Mr. Lyon... if I do decide to come for you, you're going to experience a kind of pain that you've never experienced.
What, now you're shaking in your boots? Shiver on, man.<eos> That chord.<eos> It's the devil's chord. Yeah, she told me you didn't want to use it.<eos> I was like, are you crazy? Do you hear this?<eos> Jamal.<eos> It's just music, man.<eos> You just keep playing with me, man.<eos> No... it's like I don't know what to do with you anymore, man.<eos> All right, all right, all right, I get you. Jamal.<eos> Is this what you and Tory was working on?
That's okay, baby. Let's see if I become mayor first.<eos> Then we can talk.<eos> Yes.<eos> Rafael's such a big player, why are we meeting him in a warehouse?<eos> This is my deal, shine.<eos> Why do we need him?<eos> You know, I got the same question.<eos> This is my party.<eos> And it's invitation only.<eos> Who's this clown you brought to my party?
I can't believe you set me up.<eos> I didn't set you up.<eos> Shut up. Enough.<eos> Hey, we gonna get down to business, or what?<eos> I'll deal with you later.<eos> What's wrong with you, bitch?<eos> Thank you. No.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well.<eos> I'm sorry we got off to such a messy start... but I'm still available to do business if you're interested.
So you can accept the government's protection, or you can take your chances.<eos> Maybe I should go.<eos> Maybe you should stay.<eos> - You know who Rafael is?<eos> - Very big hitter in Vegas.<eos> I set up a meeting tomorrow night.<eos> You interested?<eos> I've been trying to get Empire into the Vegas market for years.<eos> Some reason Pop won't touch it.<eos> Sorry we got off to such a messy start, but I'm still available to do business if you're interested.
So stay logged in, 'cause I'm gonna be dropping hints all night, so y'all can figure out what club we're hopping to next.<eos> Yah!<eos> Damn.<eos> I wish I was gonna be there.<eos> I'm so sorry, babe.<eos> We'll just have to celebrate when I get back from this tour.<eos> - Promise.<eos> And there y'all have it.<eos> That's how Takeem keep that long-distance love hot and heavy.<eos> But you got to watch all night to get the clues and ride Hakeem's birthday train.
- Yeah, he needs to talk to his mother.<eos> Maybe you should go talk to yours.<eos> - Mom, please.<eos> - That makes sense.<eos> You guys do the family thing, man.<eos> Yeah, bye-bye.<eos> All right, Queen B.<eos> Keep your dirty hands to yourself.<eos> - Mom, please.<eos> And what, what, what are you, get...
Well, I'm not complaining.<eos> Bourbon, rocks.<eos> You ready to talk business?<eos> I took the liberty of drafting a contract.<eos> I think we should get to know each other first.<eos> You want to get to know me here or... you want to get to know me somewhere else?<eos> I want to finish my drink.<eos> - Yeah. - Okay, okay.<eos> So, what do you want to know about me?<eos> Are you close to your father?
I'm parched.<eos> Single malt, right?<eos> See?<eos> Not a fool in sight.<eos> Oh, that is one fine man you have there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We're, uh... we're actually moving in together.<eos> Oh. Well, that's cute.<eos> So how does that work, with your hookups?<eos> Do you bring them home together now?
I could never imagine sharing him with another woman.<eos> But... I guess times have changed.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Ah. Single malt.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> To new beginnings.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Yes, honey, you are taking me back with that hair.<eos> - Girl, you did that. - Thanks, Cookie.<eos> Um, I need to know how you fell in love.
Of course I will. We all will.<eos> She's safe. No.<eos> You.<eos> Personally.<eos> I need Bella to live with you.<eos> You are the only one that I trust with her.<eos> So you want someone you hate to take care of your daughter?<eos> Bella is a Lyon.<eos> And I know how dangerous that can be.<eos> Because I've seen firsthand what you're willing to do to protect your own blood.
He's jealous because his life is nowhere near as exciting as ours.<eos> Yeah, well, Philip left me because there's a difference between exciting and messy.<eos> Messy?<eos> Babe, was it messy when I helped you create some of the best music in your career?<eos> Look, man, I'm-a always remember what we created, okay?<eos> But that was a dark time for me.<eos> I don't want to go back there.<eos> And if you really care about me, then you need to back off.<eos> Babe. Back off.<eos> And how many alcoholic beverages had you already consumed by the time you arrived at Laviticus?

Back off.<eos> And how many alcoholic beverages had you already consumed by the time you arrived at Laviticus?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Uh, two glasses or two bottles?<eos> Maybe three glasses. Uh-huh.<eos> And was this an open bar or did you pay for those yourself?
Yeah, apologies, apologies.<eos> Hakeem, please let Miss Marshall...<eos> Can I call you Kennedy?<eos> Let Kennedy answer the questions.<eos> You know what? Let's shelf the liquor talk.<eos> I mean, who keeps count when you're having a good time?<eos> Speaking of which, this is a photograph from your friend April's, uh, Instagram account.<eos> Yes, but...<eos> No, but your friend posts a photo of you embracing the alleged assailant.<eos> And you acknowledge that it's, uh, time stamped one hour before the alleged attack?

"A violent altercation with an employee with whom you once had a prior sexual encounter."<eos> Is that right?<eos> - Is that a booty call, huh?<eos> - He hit me. Hakeem, you saw it. You know he did.<eos> - Kennedy....<eos> - Hakeem, you know what happened! I'm confused here.<eos> Is my client now a character witness?<eos> The fact of the matter is you have a history of this. You sleep with men, and then later on claim it's assault. Is that safe to say?<eos> Do not answer that question, Kennedy.<eos> You are putting words into my client's mouth, Mr. Rawlings.
Stepdaddy.<eos> I'm putting all of Empire's department heads to work.<eos> Wardrobe, PR, Art Department, everybody.<eos> Wow, that sounds pretty damn ambitious.<eos> I mean, something of that size would require approval of both CEOs, and nothing came across my table.<eos> Did you cosign something like that?<eos> No, I did not.<eos> Andre, you gonna introduce me?<eos> Ma, this is Giuliana Green.<eos> I thought you two met the other night.
Winner, double zero.<eos> Ain't I gonna get a thank you kiss or nothing?<eos> I'll bet you don't know the difference between a biased wheel and a house edge.<eos> Teach me.<eos> I'm Giuliana.<eos> My friends call me Giusi.<eos> Well, I'm going to call you Giuliana.<eos> Because we're going to be much more than friends.<eos> Wait.<eos> You two know each other?
We're almost there.<eos> Yes, we are.<eos> Only thing better than breaking a new track on XStream?<eos> Screwing over Andre and Nessa at the same damn time.<eos> And we're live.<eos> Action, Hakeem.<eos> We got something special for y'all.<eos> A new voice, a new talent.<eos> Some white-hot, blue-eyed soul about to take Empire and the music world by storm.<eos> This is Tory Ash like you've never heard her before.
So we've got a ton of other people on there.<eos> Giuliana.<eos> Lucious.<eos> Well, this is Charlotte Frost, as you know, the head of the gaming commission.<eos> How are you, Giuliana?<eos> I'm wonderful.<eos> And you?<eos> - I'm good.<eos> - Andre.<eos> You and Nessa are out.
And you?<eos> - I'm good.<eos> - Andre.<eos> You and Nessa are out.<eos> Wanted to share that with you.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> Did not expect this.<eos> Lucious, when Giuliana told me I had to come to New York, I was prepared to be irked if it wasn't worth my while.<eos> But this... this crosses the threshold into interesting.<eos> "Interesting." She said you would call it interesting.

She said you would call it interesting.<eos> Initially, I was going to bore you with a bunch of charts and graphs, but Giuliana said that we should put on a live-action show.<eos> So you can get - a tangible experience from it.
Previously on Empire...<eos> You got to protect - this angel with your life.<eos> - I will.<eos> You on your way to being woke.<eos> Make some music that means something.<eos> This is the head of the gaming commission, Charlotte Frost.<eos> I did not expect this.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> You and Nessa are out.
We're getting smoke blown up our asses, that's what's happening.<eos> What...<eos> The bar is shut down! - Everybody out!<eos> I don't smell no fire.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> If it isn't my brother Numpsay.<eos> Mr. Lyon.<eos> Boys.<eos> Hope you are enjoying yourselves, but... please exit my club now.

What?<eos> Will you be nice, please?<eos> If you read on, um, it's a $25 million settlement agreement.<eos> That is, of course, if you're not planning on contesting it.<eos> That's more than you ever offered me.<eos> I gave you half of my company.<eos> No, I worked my ass off for my half.<eos> Well, I'm sorry if that's not enough for your greedy little ass.<eos> I got something for your... Ooh.<eos> I understand that you and Lucious are working on a song together, Jamal.
Mr. Lyon, there's someone at the gate.<eos> I don't care, I'm eating lunch.<eos> Sir, I think you should come.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Are y'all finished eating these worms and these snails?<eos> Grass?<eos> Can you tell Juanita bring some more wine and peach cobbler, please?<eos> Juanita, get her something.<eos> Hold on, hold on, what...<eos> Who are you, and why are you in my house?
Who are you, and why are you in my house?<eos> Sir, I'm from OCSF New York. Child Protective Services.<eos> I don't give a damn where you're from,<eos> I didn't invite you.<eos> Juanita, how...<eos> - Get the hell out of my house.<eos> - Sir, we have received reports of child endangerment at this residence.<eos> I have an order to temporarily remove the child until an inves...<eos> I don't care what you got.<eos> You don't have the right to be in my house.
We gonna have every one of y'all asses fired!<eos> Shame on you.<eos> It's all right.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You're just gonna go away for a little bit..<eos> You're gonna take a nice little ride.<eos> Just for a minute.<eos> You think I don't know who's behind this?<eos> It's the DuBois.<eos> You work for 'em?
Previously on Empire...<eos> Andre... promise me that you'll destroy that bitch that killed our baby.<eos> Laviticus Las Vegas is not like any other club.<eos> You and Nessa are out.
Previously on Empire...<eos> Andre... promise me that you'll destroy that bitch that killed our baby.<eos> Laviticus Las Vegas is not like any other club.<eos> You and Nessa are out.<eos> You two know each other?
Don't make me ask you again.<eos> Give her to me now, sir.<eos> You think I don't know who's behind this?<eos> It's the Dubois.<eos> My family and I...<eos> Perhaps they should speak first.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> It might be best if the Lyon family speaks first.<eos> Okay, lady, we know you got connections - and I know you got juice.<eos> - That's why I know you had something to do with my grandbaby getting snatched.
- Come on.<eos> What Ms. Lyon is trying to get at is: This is about a child.<eos> So, it's understandable that tempers are hot.<eos> Now, the Lyon family has reason to believe that the Dubois family had something to do with Child Protective Services coming to their home and taking the baby, Bella.<eos> A heinous act, that has the own child's father, Hakeem Lyon, too distraught to even be here today.<eos> Now, we demand that the child be returned home.<eos> If that can happen, everything will be right as rain.<eos> Our family had nothing to do with whatever happened to your baby.<eos> I'm sorry, your family took $5 million from mine.<eos> So what is all this, are you... you want to humble us, you want us to bow down?

Okay, okay.
Please.<eos> Please, just help me find my child.<eos> Please.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> I think it's terrible that your child was taken.<eos> Please.<eos> You are so much better than the company you keep.<eos> And yes, we have connections.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Connections born from generations of serving our community... a community which you have chosen to represent very differently, I might add.

Where's she at? !<eos> I don't know.<eos> Bad news is, is that we're gonna have to, distance most of the Lyon family from the child.<eos> Okay, then why is that?<eos> Because on paper, all of you are unfit.<eos> I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.<eos> Please.<eos> This whole situation... it's sick.<eos> This whole family... is sick.<eos> Hey, Anika, y-you two are still married, but if we can expedite the divorce, it would show in good faith that you're making an asserted effort to distance yourself from the family and that will benefit us.
Can you get Paulie Walnuts to back up off me?<eos> So why am I meeting with you behind Lucious' back?<eos> 'Cause you're doing a deal with a man who's lying to you.<eos> - What's he talking about?<eos> - Inferno.<eos> Lucious is billing it as performances by all of Empire's artists, and he doesn't have Jamal Lyon.<eos> Empire's biggest star.<eos> Not to mention, the show is struggling.<eos> Lucious doesn't like the script, so...<eos> So what are you offering?
Such a disgrace.<eos> A setback for the entire race, with their degrading lyrics and thuggish behavior.<eos> I won't lie to you, I had nothing to do with that baby being taken.<eos> But I can't say that I feel an ounce of sympathy for them.<eos> - Well, of cour... course not.<eos> Yeah, free Bella!<eos> Free Bella!<eos> You need to free Bella, you dirty Dubois.<eos> What's this? Really?<eos> You steal a baby?

Hi, baby.<eos> Mom, what's going on?<eos> Andre told me we're getting Bella back.<eos> You okay?<eos> - Mom, is she gonna be okay?<eos> - Yes, she's gonna be fine.<eos> We're gonna get her back. Okay? You know what?<eos> - You sure?<eos> - Yes. Just go wait in the car. Go ahead.<eos> You telling me you and Shine are gonna do this?
I got to hit a meeting.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Hakeem needs us right now.<eos> Giuliana's waiting for me.<eos> Inferno is gonna be the biggest live show Las Vegas has ever seen.<eos> We're gonna do for the Strip what Hamilton did for Broadway. It's gonna be hot.<eos> You got to trust me on this, Charlotte.<eos> Everybody thinks they're gonna be the next Hamilton, Giuliana.<eos> Look, I've heard this pitch a million times.<eos> Yeah, but what you haven't heard is my new music.
Look, I've heard this pitch a million times.<eos> Yeah, but what you haven't heard is my new music.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I don't drink.<eos> I respect that.<eos> Can I get you some coffee?<eos> No, I don't drink alcohol or coffee.<eos> I'm Mormon.<eos> Silly me.<eos> All this time, I thought you was Mexican.

- My dear, I'm ahead.<eos> If you want some of this behind, you better scale up.<eos> A first-class casino would've comped us a room and had these winnings secure in a safe by now.<eos> You know, just saying.<eos> Sir, madam.<eos> If you would like, we could put your winnings in one of our vaults.<eos> Get off of me! I will shut this place down!<eos> Get your hands off of me! My name is...!<eos> Seems a little hectic here tonight.<eos> If you don't mind, I'd like to take a tour of the vault first.
Get off of me.<eos> High-roller on table four would like a tour of the vaults.<eos> Meet me at the east security door, and make sure Cookie is out of this building.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> I will end your career, bitch! Get off of me.<eos> I can walk.<eos> Lucious.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Everything's absolutely fine.<eos> Look, I know you've got concerns about Inferno's crowd, but I assure you, you'll be able to bring your husband and your kids to this place.
Your last little stunt cost us a half a million dollars.<eos> But it's worth it if it means I can get my gaming license.<eos> So what are we calling this one?<eos> "Charitable donation"?<eos> I don't care what you call it.<eos> But after reading these, the price might go up.<eos> I didn't know Mormons took payoffs.<eos> Wow. You people really are prone to stereotypes.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Now, if you'll excuse me,
Look, Hakeem, listen.<eos> I know that you're worried, I'm worried, too.<eos> But don't be crazy, like your grandmother, all right?<eos> I know that Bella's all right. I can...<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Wow, the venue is amazing.<eos> I can't wait to see Inferno light up this space. Now, there is one thing I'd like to share with both of you.<eos> September 7, 1996.<eos> Yes. That would be the day that Tupac was shot.<eos> You know your Vegas history.
I ain't your son.<eos> Thank God my mom didn't marry yo ass.<eos> Now, does these people have my daughter?<eos> We know where she is.<eos> She's safe and sound.<eos> Tell me right now.<eos> Look, I just want to see her again.<eos> I'll do anything.<eos> Well.<eos> You heard him, he said he'd do anything.
I think I like gentle persuasion better.<eos> I bet Mitt's made up his mind by now.<eos> Hope you and your family enjoy the show.<eos> Goodbye, Mrs. Frost.<eos> Good looking out, Pablo. I got you.<eos> Hey, how you doing?<eos> Cookie.<eos> You understand me when I say take care of my family, right?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> You know what time it is.
If you're still at the hotel, I can just have it messengered. Yes, actually, can you send it to The Peninsula in the penthouse suite?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Finally.<eos> Lord. How long's it take to get some hot sauce in here?<eos> Anika Lyon?<eos> I prefer "Calhoun."<eos> You're under arrest for the murder of Tariq Cousins.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you.

So, you might want to watch what you say.<eos> Can you please make sure that those scans that Dr. West ordered are loaded in?<eos> So, it's, story time.<eos> Tonight I was gonna read the short story by Borges, the one you said that he loved.<eos> Dwight.<eos> Dwight.<eos> Dwight.<eos> You can go.<eos> No, we're not going nowhere no time soon.<eos> You mind telling us why you sent that nurse for the scans?
Yeah, Dean. 'Sup?<eos> Billie?<eos> The reaper?<eos> We made a deal.<eos> Come midnight, a Winchester goes bye-bye.<eos> We made a pact, bound in blood.<eos> You break that, there's consequences on a cosmic scale.<eos> Cass, what have you done?<eos> What had to be done.<eos> Yeah, you made a deal.
I'll go get Mirabel.<eos> So nice to see you, old friend.<eos> Have some pie.<eos> Wow.<eos> Hell of a friend, Cass.<eos> Why do you let him talk to you like that?<eos> If Ishim can help me find whoever killed Benjamin, then I have to.<eos> Okay, yeah, look, I-I get that we need super dick there, but, I mean, come on.<eos> The angels that I served with are being killed.<eos> So I will put up with Ishim, I will put up with everything else, and so will you.
All right, but we'll find her, me and Sam.<eos> No, Dean.<eos> Cass, she doesn't care about us, okay?<eos> She's gunning for you guys.<eos> Yeah, maybe we can reason with her.<eos> Uh, four dead angels indicate that perhaps she is not reasonable.<eos> If she has this dark power, it will take all of us to fight her.<eos> And I need to heal your wound.<eos> Wait -- wait a second, Cass.<eos> Her family was murdered. I mean, I-I know you were just doing a job, but --
They pinged the LoJack --<eos> Okay, you could've just said yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> So what's the plan?<eos> Well, we knock on her door and ask her nicely not to kill anymore angels.<eos> And if she says no?<eos> Then we burn that bridge when we come to it.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Whoa! Give us a second.<eos> How did you find me?
We heard what happened to your family.<eos> My family?<eos> See, Cass is our family, so we can't let you hurt him.<eos> Let me?<eos> We don't wanna kill you.<eos> I don't wanna kill you.<eos> Okay, good. Look, there we go. Agreed.<eos> Listen, it's not Cass' fault that Heaven has these crazy rules about Nephilim.<eos> Your daughter.<eos> You think...
I-I get wanting revenge.<eos> I-I really do.<eos> But...why wait so long?<eos> I had no choice.<eos> Before the angels fell, before they lost their wings, there would've been no way to hunt them down.<eos> But now...<eos> Patience is a talent.<eos> You'd be amazed what a person can do with a little bit of purpose and an abundance of time.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Ishim said you made some kind of pact, um... that you're using dark magic.
Ishim said you made some kind of pact, um... that you're using dark magic.<eos> Did he?<eos> I've studied angels all my... very long life.<eos> I use their magic to fight, to hear them, to stay alive.<eos> Enochian magic.<eos> That's...possible?<eos> It is if you're willing to pay the price of admission.<eos> Every time I use one of their spells, a piece of my soul burns away.<eos> And once it's gone...<eos> You won't feel anything anymore.

My family hunts.<eos> It's what we do.<eos> Let's begin.<eos> Toni Bevell, Men of Letters, London chapter house.<eos> If you answer my questions, you'll walk right out that door.<eos> I've been tortured by the Devil himself.<eos> What can you do to me?
It's always nice to see a Winchester who can't get what he wants.<eos> Billie.<eos> She's a reaper.<eos> See, I'm a big believer in what dies...<eos> Sam!<eos> ...stays dead.<eos> No!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Dean.<eos> If any of you change your minds, you know my name.
If any of you change your minds, you know my name.<eos> We've got to put Lucifer back in the cage.<eos> I think I know the identity of Lucifer's newest vessel --<eos> Jefferson Rooney,<eos> President of these United States.<eos> I just know you'd make an amazing father.<eos> A nephilim has come into being.<eos> It's the offspring of an angel and a human.<eos> Lucifer.<eos> So you're gonna pop Lucifer out of the President with that?

What about the girl?<eos> Kelly Kline. And she's a Presidential aide, but no one's seen her since that day.<eos> We don't know where she went or if she's still alive.<eos> How many people know about this?<eos> We're keeping it quiet.<eos> Just you, me, the agents who made the arrest, and POTUS.<eos> But the last thing he remembers... was saying his nightly prayers three days before it happened.<eos> Drugged?<eos> Lab's running a tox screen now, but yeah, probably.<eos> And by "probably," you mean "maybe."

But you want my opinion?<eos> We should take those two psychos out back. I cap one, you take the other, we grab an early lunch.<eos> Yeah?<eos> They got it comin'.<eos> Yeah, but what if they're not working alone?<eos> I mean, what if these boys have ties to... Oh, I don't know, white nationalists, Muslim brotherhood?<eos> Really?<eos> I'm just sayin'.<eos> They might be the tip of some nasty-ass iceberg.<eos> That -- that's what you think?
Hi, Dean.<eos> How you doin'?<eos> Can I get you coffee?<eos> Water?<eos> Or you hungry?<eos> I got a chocolate bar here somewhere.<eos> Don't tell my wife.<eos> So...you've had a day.<eos> Wanna tell me about it?<eos> Like, for example, why you went after the leader of the free world?
Now what I'm saying, Wally, is that you need people like us, and we need hunters like you.<eos> Now all we ask in return is that when we call, you go where you're told and you do what you're told.<eos> For the greater good.<eos> Let me see your hands.<eos> Come on, let me see your hands.<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> Soft.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You ever hunt anything?
You ever hunt anything?<eos> I'm more tactical.<eos> Long-term strategy.<eos> Right.<eos> Listen, uh, Mike --<eos> Mick.<eos> Whatever.<eos> I don't know you, and I ain't looking to take any orders from anyone.<eos> Especially some limey paper pusher.<eos> I'm not quite sure you understand, mate.
He's...<eos> Mary?<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is Alicia. Uh, Asa's kid.<eos> Oh.<eos> Look, I -- me and my brother, we're working this case in Louisiana.<eos> We thought it was some southern fried werewolf thing, but it's not one thing.<eos> It's a pack.<eos> There's, like, a billion of them down here, and...we need help.<eos> Where are you?
What happened?<eos> I was doing my rounds and I did CPR, but he was gone.<eos> Get that other cell open.<eos> Now!<eos> He's dead.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> They both died on the same day?<eos> That's not...<eos> How's that even possible?<eos> You tell us.
Get that other cell open.<eos> Now!<eos> He's dead.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> They both died on the same day?<eos> That's not...<eos> How's that even possible?<eos> You tell us.<eos> Great plan.<eos> For the last two months, we've done nothing but sit around with our junk in our hands because you wanted to wait them out.
That's not...<eos> How's that even possible?<eos> You tell us.<eos> Great plan.<eos> For the last two months, we've done nothing but sit around with our junk in our hands because you wanted to wait them out.<eos> That really worked.<eos> Yeah, nice job.<eos> Well, I'm just gonna...<eos> Yeah.<eos> You wanted them dead.
Okay, we will. All right?<eos> Later.<eos> This is your idea?<eos> The people that almost killed my boys, they're gonna be our backup?<eos> Suddenly, the demon and his mommy don't look so bad.<eos> They helped us with Lucifer.<eos> Lucifer?<eos> The Lucifer?<eos> Yes.<eos> Wait, so you're telling me what happened in Indianapolis was you took on the bleedin' Devil himself?
But Sam and Dean were taken.<eos> We think we can get them back, but we need... help.<eos> So we'll help.<eos> Really?<eos> Just like that?<eos> Mrs. Winchester -<eos> - Mary...<eos> I came to this country to do one thing -- make friends.<eos> But you American hunters, you're -- you're a different breed than our sort.<eos> You're surly, suspicious.
Really?<eos> Just like that?<eos> Mrs. Winchester -<eos> - Mary...<eos> I came to this country to do one thing -- make friends.<eos> But you American hunters, you're -- you're a different breed than our sort.<eos> You're surly, suspicious.<eos> You don't play well with others.<eos> Well, that is accurate.<eos> You don't trust people you don't know, even when they come bearing gifts.
You don't trust people you don't know, even when they come bearing gifts.<eos> Now I can't help that, but I can help you.<eos> And if word were to get out that we did our part to save Sam and Dean Winchester, well, that's just good business, innit?<eos> And who knows. When all this is over, we might even be friends.<eos> We think Sam and Dean were being held somewhere in the Rocky Mountain National Forest.<eos> Site 94?<eos> It's a government facility, off-books.<eos> Shadow ops.<eos> One of those places that officially doesn't exist.<eos> Then how do you know about it?
Then how do you know about it?<eos> We gather information.<eos> It's our job.<eos> They told us to meet them off State Route 34.<eos> Well, that's a long stretch of road. Where, exactly?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> I'll our techs to put a satellite over the area.<eos> You can do that?<eos> And so much more.<eos> Do you have any idea what sort of trouble we're walking into?
This the man in charge?<eos> That's right.<eos> Well, let me tell you how this is gonna go.<eos> You're gonna call your boys and you're gonna turn around, and nobody's gonna get hurt.<eos> No, no.<eos> Here's how this is gonna go.<eos> I take my highly trained soldiers, track your ass down, and you get hurt.<eos> A lot.<eos> You can't run forever.<eos> You're trapped out here.
You're trapped out here.<eos> Well, what we have here is a failure to communicate.<eos> 'Cause we're not trapped out here with you.<eos> You're trapped out here with us.<eos> That'll work.<eos> Go!<eos> You'll live.<eos> Hey.<eos> I told you.<eos> You're trapped.
Shoot him!<eos> Don't.<eos> Hand me the gun.<eos> You want the truth?<eos> The President was possessed by the Devil.<eos> We saved his life.<eos> That's the truth.<eos> Now you can take that and do what you want with it.<eos> But if you come after us, you know what'll happen.<eos> Who are you?
Well, we don't have one.<eos> Just borrowed it for a bit.<eos> Friends in all the right places.<eos> Well, I guess this is where we're supposed to say thank you. No need.<eos> Happy to be of service.<eos> Again.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> We should get.<eos> The people we left, they'll call for backup any second.<eos> Uh, you left survivors?
There's only one way we were getting out of there, and that wasn't breathing.<eos> So I made a call.<eos> Billie.<eos> Dean talked with her, and then Billie came to see me.<eos> And we made a deal.<eos> We'd get to die and come back one more time, but in exchange...<eos> Come midnight, a Winchester goes bye-bye.<eos> Like, permanently.<eos> And that is something I've been looking forward to for a long time.<eos> Why would you -- We were already dead.

Mom!<eos> Don't!<eos> I love you.<eos> Cass, what have you done?<eos> What had to be done.<eos> You know this world, this sad, doomed little world, it needs you.<eos> It needs every last Winchester it can get, and I will not let you die.<eos> I won't let any of you die.<eos> And I won't let you sacrifice yourselves.<eos> You mean too much to me, to everything.

Ohh.<eos> Ugh.<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> Mm.<eos> Ah.<eos> Wow.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> And I was like, "Andy, the dog's vegan." Hey, hey.<eos> "How could you give him -""<eos> Excuse me. Do you mind if I --
Fine, but until you get better...<eos> Lamp.<eos> Right.<eos> So close.<eos> Shall we end the suspense?<eos> What's that?<eos> Six in a row?<eos> Beginner's luck.<eos> Oh.<eos> Gentlemen, if you don't mind.
Yeah.<eos> Last night, you told me your name was Springsteen.<eos> Like The Boss.<eos> Uh, yeah, see, sometimes, we have to lie in order to, uh, to... protect our cover.<eos> No way.<eos> Okay, listen, this is actually sensitive.<eos> We -- we think my partner may have been roofied.<eos> Seriously.<eos> Seriously?<eos> If you can tell us anything about what happened that night, it would be a big help.
Well, he can't come with me, and I'm not leaving him alone.<eos> And I obviously don't trust you.<eos> Well, obviously.<eos> The Black Grimoire's written in ancient Druid.<eos> How do you propose to find a proper spell without me there to --<eos> Well, you said a few of the Loughlins survived, right?<eos> That was the rumor?<eos> So you expect one of them to -- to what?<eos> Translate their ancient super secret family spell book for you?<eos> You just killed their brother.
Because I know you won't remember.<eos> You're in?<eos> Shh. Yeah, I'm in.<eos> All right.<eos> As soon as I get the translation, you cast the spell.<eos> This gun is full of witch-killing bullets.<eos> So why don't you go to your grimoire and tell me how to break the memory spell?<eos> I told him you'd come.<eos> Boyd wanted to go after you, but I said, "Why bother?"<eos> You're hunters.

Personally.<eos> Something I thought you might like.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> It's amazing what some people just leave laying about.<eos> Consider it your coronation present.<eos> Pardon?<eos> Brings me to your final gift -- the Throne of Hell.<eos> You want me to be king?<eos> Well, with Lilith and Azazel dead, and Lucifer back in his box, we need a ruler.<eos> You are next in line, Ramiel.
Still, the crown is yours if you want it.<eos> I don't.<eos> You take it.<eos> I...<eos> Pardon?<eos> You seem ambitious enough, conniving enough, slimy enough.<eos> So take it!<eos> Go for the glory, kid.<eos> I mean, one dares to dream, but what about the others?<eos> You're not the only prince.
No.<eos> There's a cure.<eos> There's always a cure, and we will find it.<eos> How?<eos> We trap Ramiel.<eos> And we beat his ass until he gives it up.<eos> It's not gonna work.<eos> We took down the Darkness and the Devil.<eos> It took you years to defeat Lucifer, and the power of God to stop the Darkness.<eos> Maybe if you had more time, you could manage Ramiel.

For once, why don't you pick a side?<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> What's so urgent?<eos> Sam... I messed up.<eos> I know I messed up.<eos> But what the British Men of Letters are doing, this is bigger than us, Sam.<eos> We've got a real shot here.<eos> Shot at what?<eos> A world without monsters.<eos> A world where you and Dean don't have to hunt, where you can have normal lives.
I am not trying to recruit you, but you need to know.<eos> Things are changing.<eos> Please.<eos> Just let me show you.<eos> It's, just in here.<eos> Wow.<eos> Believe it or not, this is just their temporary base.<eos> The Brits talk like they're roughing it.<eos> Sam Winchester.<eos> You didn't tell me your son was stopping by.
Well, this is a Men of Letters bunker.<eos> The location's no secret to us.<eos> Okay.<eos> Cool.<eos> Well, good talk.<eos> And whilst I understand that you're not feeling... warmly disposed to me, I wonder, what's your disposition to this incredibly rare, unspeakably expensive, bottle of barrel proof Scotch?<eos> Before we get started, we've got a few new faces.<eos> This is Pierce Moncrieff, a hunter out of Baton Rouge.<eos> Pierce meet Alton Morehead, our head of RD... Weapons development, spell work, that sort of thing. And Serena Colman, our Head of Security and Surveillance.<eos> And, of course, you know Mary Winchester and her son.
As most of you know, Phase One of Project V is nearly complete.<eos> Over the past months, we've focused our efforts on the NWR.<eos> Midwest Region.<eos> When we started our operation, there were 241 vampires active across 12 states.<eos> We've killed all... but 11.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Seriously?<eos> How?<eos> You American hunters tend to see vampires as criminals, rogues.<eos> One gets out of line, you show up, lop off its head, and leave town.
Hello, my children.<eos> Nice place.<eos> Quaint.<eos> Cozy.<eos> Not much for small talk, are we?<eos> Nope.<eos> Well, surely, you have some questions.<eos> Why I'm here, for instance.<eos> You're here to recruit us.<eos> You already got Mary playing your game.
I tell ya, sure do miss that crotchety old son of a bitch.<eos> Pierce?<eos> Mary?<eos> A question.<eos> So?<eos> Thoughts on our little operation?<eos> And our team?<eos> Serena and Alton seem smart.<eos> Pierce...<eos> You know he calls himself.
He told us.<eos> He's back to save us all.<eos> Our father.<eos> Your father?<eos> The... the Alpha?<eos> No, that's impossible. Our Intel has him in... in Morocco.<eos> He's been there for at least a decade.<eos> Wrong.<eos> I met him five years ago in Hoople, North Dakota.<eos> You're dead.

No.<eos> Pierce, you're a Hunter.<eos> Yes.<eos> My hunter.<eos> Pierce and I have an arrangement.<eos> He keeps me off the radar, and I pay him very, very well.<eos> Alimony's a bitch.<eos> I'm old.<eos> I like living quietly.<eos> You've been making my life awfully noisy lately.
My, my.<eos> The Colt.<eos> Powerful weapon.<eos> Sam, you are aware that there are five creatures on this Earth that gun cannot kill.<eos> I'm one of them.<eos> If that were true, I'd be dead already.<eos> That gun can't save all of you.<eos> Who said I was here to save all of us?<eos> My family and I, we kill vamps when they get out of line.<eos> And you've let us.
If you hadn't been there tonight...<eos> Yeah, we got the kill.<eos> That's what matters.<eos> Hardly an advertisement for the British Men of Letters, though.<eos> Or my leadership.<eos> Caught unawares with our proverbial pants down.<eos> Believe it or not, Sam, we're not...<eos> I'm in.<eos> Look, tonight was bad, no doubt, but the Alpha Vampire is dead.<eos> You're changing the world, and I wanna be a part of it.
Mrs. Winchester, I believe you're drawn to danger.<eos> Drink?<eos> Have you talked to mom lately?<eos> Shouldn't worry about your mum.<eos> Her and ketch make quite a team.<eos> Would you want your mom working with him?<eos> Well, that was unexpected.<eos> Dr. hess. I didn't think you left London.
So maybe they're starting up again?<eos> Maybe it's a cycle of some sort?<eos> Well...<eos> One way to find out.<eos> Pew.<eos> It's time.<eos> I'm sorry, but why the feds interested in jarrod Hayes?<eos> Just following' orders.<eos> Yeah, um...<eos> So what can you tell us about the case?
Look, maybe jarrod did get got.<eos> We're working every lead.<eos> But you ask me, he just bailed.<eos> And why would he do that?<eos> Jarrod's had it rough.<eos> Mom left years ago. And his dad...<eos> Well, let's just say jarrod "fell down the stairs a lot,"<eos> you know what I mean. Wait a second.<eos> If you knew he was being abused, why didn't you... We tried. Trying to take a child from his parents, even if they're the worst people in the world, not easy.<eos> Did you talk to his old man?
Yeah, well, the sheriff is a jackass, all right?<eos> Look, he thinks jarrod just skipped town.<eos> You don't? I know he didn't.<eos> Did you tell that to the cops?<eos> Man, sheriff bishop's not gonna believe me.<eos> We got...<eos> History.<eos> History? Any time something happens in this town, he brings me in for questioning.<eos> Why is that?<eos> Why do you think?
Excuse me, sir.<eos> Hi. Agents stark and martell,<eos> We're looking for daryn Boston.<eos> Daryn?<eos> Is he in trouble?<eos> No, no, no, not at all. We... We spoke with him yesterday.<eos> Just wanna ask a few follow-up questions.<eos> I don't suppose he's around.<eos> No, daryn... daryn didn't show up for work today.<eos> So when was the last time you saw him?
Sure. So we roll into town, look into a case, talk to the local badge...<eos> And then our one witness goes missing.<eos> Last place he was seen owned by the sheriff.<eos> Sound like a coincidence?<eos> You hungry?<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> Excuse me, sheriff.<eos> You run the joint. Well, my name's on the paperwork.<eos> Pete handles the day to day.<eos> Are you still trying to chase down jarrod Hayes?
Excuse me, sheriff.<eos> You run the joint. Well, my name's on the paperwork.<eos> Pete handles the day to day.<eos> Are you still trying to chase down jarrod Hayes?<eos> Yeah, and, now daryn Boston.<eos> Yeah. Seems to have gone missing, too.<eos> Jeez.<eos> First I've heard of it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So tell us, what have you heard about black bill?
I mean, what, are they, like, "croquet's all right."<eos> But you know what'd be great?<eos> "Murder."<eos> Hiya, sheriff.<eos> Talk.<eos> This is not what it looks like.<eos> Really? 'Cause it looks like a straight up murder room to me.<eos> Sheriff, what's goin' on?<eos> You...<eos> You won't believe me.
Barry.<eos> Different moms, same daddy.<eos> Old man bishop, he, he had an eye for the ladies.<eos> Everyone in town knew about it, but didn't make a difference.<eos> Barry grew up in the big house.<eos> I grew up in a double wide.<eos> Does that sound fair to you?<eos> Honestly?<eos> Sounds like a bad episode of "dynasty."<eos> You got a lot of jokes.
Kelly, the angels? The Winchesters?<eos> The good guys? They want you dead.<eos> But I can protect you.<eos> I can protect your son.<eos> Cass, it's me.<eos> I've been trying to get ahold of you for days.<eos> Stay cool.<eos> Walk with me.<eos> We wanna help.<eos> You call this helping?
Again and again.<eos> When you were taken, I searched for months and I couldn't find you.<eos> And then Kelly escaped on my watch, and I couldn't find her.<eos> And I just wanted...<eos> I needed to come back here with a win for you.<eos> For myself.<eos> You think you're the only one rolling snake eyes here?<eos> Me and Sam, we had her.<eos> We had Kelly and we lost her.<eos> And if you find her again?
Showtime.<eos> Andnowwe 'vegot 5 seconds to see more of the Super Catch Phrase and win the bank.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Cindy, for $350, tell us what it is.<eos> Pumpingiron?<eos> Not right.<eos> Chip and Cindy...<eos> Got a lot of people in the audience who think they know, but we have a Toss Up Catch Phrase for you.<eos> Now your opponent knows, but she can't guess.<eos> Only you are entitled.
Kelly?<eos> Yeah, that's mine.<eos> What the hell are you thinking?<eos> - Dean?<eos> - What?<eos> ! Dean!<eos> Kelly?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> How did you find us?
He's taking me to Heaven.<eos> You...<eos> You're taking her to the sandbox?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm ending this, once and for all.<eos> Kelly and her baby have to die.<eos> No, they don't.<eos> Listen, we found another way.<eos> And you would know that if you would answer your phone.<eos> Wait, what are you talking about?
Hey, Kelly. Kelly.<eos> Hey, wait, wait. Wait a second, look.<eos> We... we can't imagine what you've been through, okay?<eos> But we promised we'd find another way, and we did.<eos> We found a better way.<eos> This can work.<eos> I'm going with Castiel.<eos> No, Kelly, if you go with Cass, you die. Your baby dies.<eos> I go with you, you take away the thing that makes him special.<eos> How does that matter if you're both dead?
I am.<eos> I've been so lost.<eos> I'm not lost anymore.<eos> And I know now that this child must be born with all of his power.<eos> You can't actually mean that.<eos> Yes. I do.<eos> I have faith.<eos> We have to go.<eos> Hey, Cass, wait a second. Wait, hold on. Just...<eos> You have to just trust me.
Dr. Hess wants to know everything about our "friends" the Winchesters...<eos> Their allies... their habits.<eos> How does Sam get his hair so shiny? When I saw Dagon had captured Kelly, I thought the angels could help.<eos> And?<eos> Time to take this off the board.<eos> No!<eos> I know now that this child must be born with all of his power.<eos> Hello?<eos> You have to ring the bell.<eos> You startled me.

This is a colossally stupid idea.<eos> Yep.<eos> Big, beautiful, and dumb.<eos> I've had this thing for so long.<eos> Been waiting for the perfect moment to use it.<eos> The explosion could kill us all.<eos> You could bring the whole bloody place crashing down.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're lunatics.
Dead.<eos> Uh, dead.<eos> Wait, I got one.<eos> Garth?<eos> Hey.<eos> Oh, man. It's good to hear your voice.<eos> Listen, uh, those Brits I told you about, they've got a hit out on American Hunters.<eos> I'm guessing that goes double for werewolf hunters, so...<eos> No, I don't have time to explain.<eos> You and Bess need to get someplace safe.
Here she is.<eos> Do your thing.<eos> All right, you said you could fix her, so fix her.<eos> I, um...<eos> Well, I -- She lied.<eos> What?<eos> Mary's programming...<eos> It's permanent.<eos> But you said...<eos> You were going to kill me.

Your mother can't be saved.<eos> All right, "Lady," time's up.<eos> We only kept you alive for one reason.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Listen, uh, Ketch keeps callin' Mom's phone.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> Let it go to voicemail.<eos> Let's take a nice little short walk to the backyard.<eos> This is not going to stop.<eos> Soon enough, they'll find out you're alive, and then...

Mom.<eos> We gotta get out of here, okay?<eos> You need to come with me.<eos> Mom?<eos> Mom.<eos> Mom.<eos> What is happening out there?<eos> Perimeter's breached.<eos> Hunters.<eos> Gentlemen, ladies, you know what to do.
Ah. This is fun.<eos> Hey!<eos> I got this.<eos> Yeah.<eos> When you left us alone in the bunker, man, I knew you were psycho, but I didn't think you were stupid.<eos> I may be many things but I'm not stupid.<eos> Mom?<eos> Mary.<eos> I knew you were a killer.<eos> You both are.
You both are.<eos> You're right.<eos> Whatever it takes -- open a portal.<eos> Just get me the hell out of here.<eos> I'm afraid we don't have the resources for an extraction at this moment.<eos> Don't!<eos> Don't.<eos> Listen, Dean --<eos> It's Sam.<eos> And you must be Hess, I trust.
I have faith...<eos> Don't. ...in this child.<eos> ♪ Carry on, my wayward son ♪ She will shoot you.<eos> ♪ Lay your weary head to rest ♪ Mary.<eos> ♪ Don't you cry no more ♪<eos> God, please.<eos> I need help.<eos> I'm trying to help you, ma'am.<eos> Are you, Sven?<eos> Because if you ask me if I have the quarter-inch Allen wrench one -- one more time, I am going to come down there and burn your giant Viking junkyard of a store to the ground!

Are you sure it wasn't in the box?
Witty. I'll use that in the future.<eos> All right, well, I'd love to chat with ya, but, uh, why waste my time, right?<eos> It's not like you matter.<eos> I don't need to put on the old Sam suit anymore, do I?<eos> You know, if you think we're just gonna let you walk --<eos> Oh, hey, Dean!<eos> Y-- I know you fellas are gonna try, you know, whatever.<eos> Whatever you're gonna try.<eos> But you can't kill me.<eos> You've never been able to kill me.

Really?<eos> Yeah, really.<eos> Lucifer.<eos> Funny.<eos> I always thought I'd be the one to kill her.<eos> Crowley...why did you do it?<eos> Save Lucifer -- What did you want?<eos> I wanted to win.<eos> I perverted mother's spell, put Lucifer in a vessel of my own making because I wanted to win.<eos> You have any idea how many people have made a play for my throne over the years?
Gave me time to think.<eos> You know, I've been focused for so long on keeping my job. Never realized I hate it.<eos> All those whining demons, the endless moan of damned souls, the paperwork!<eos> I mean, who wants that?<eos> You.<eos> Unh-unh. Once, maybe.<eos> So why are you here?<eos> Well, whenever there's a world-ending crisis at hand, I know where to place my bets.<eos> It's on you, you big, beautiful, lumbering piles of flannel.<eos> So if you'll forgive my transgression, I'll make it worth your while.

Mm. And it is a world without fear and without suffering and without hate.<eos> Mm. I saw paradise.<eos> Dean?<eos> Cass, is this place warded?<eos> Yes, heavily.<eos> Heavy enough to stop Lucifer?<eos> Lucifer?<eos> He could be right behind us.<eos> I don't...<eos> What are you doing here?
Doubt it.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Been dead over 40 years now.<eos> Only reason I know about him is this Hunter I ran with,<eos> Mary Campbell.<eos> You get a few pints of shine into her, and she always told the same story about the man she loved -- John Winchester.<eos> Azazel killed her about 10 years ago.<eos> Cass, what the hell is this?<eos> This is a world where you were never born.<eos> It's a world you never saved.
Sometimes.<eos> Mm. This is gonna work.<eos> It has to.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It will be fine.<eos> Remember -- paradise,.<eos> Well...<eos> this is a fun surprise.<eos> ♪ I gotta hand it to you guys.<eos> You never give up, even when you should.
"Previously on Broadchurch..."<eos> Hi.<eos> Trish, is it?<eos> You called about an attack, a sexual attack.
Hi.<eos> Trish, is it?<eos> You called about an attack, a sexual attack.<eos> Trish Winterman of West Flintcombe has made an allegation of rape against an unknown attacker.<eos> If it happened at the party, that's a long list of people to eliminate.<eos> There were 50 men at your party on Saturday night?<eos> Yeah.<eos> At least 50.<eos> - Wessex Police.<eos> Who are you?
When's that?<eos> Can we not use the word victim?<eos> Her name is Trish Winterman.<eos> Her ABE interview will take place when we judge she's up to it.<eos> We'll get a steer from her ISVA later this morning.<eos> There's a time pressure here. Right?<eos> If she's still traumatised, she may not have full recall.<eos> - Was she drunk?<eos> - What?<eos> DC Harford, are you wanting to run this meeting?
Nets and lines for fishing used to be the main industry, but we're the only one left making them in Broadchurch now.<eos> All the others closed up.<eos> Fishing's dying on its arse.<eos> So, what sort of samples are you after?<eos> Er, one of every product you make.<eos> Nets and lines?<eos> We do a lot.<eos> I'd like one of everything, please.<eos> And... what do you want it for?<eos> You'll be assisting us with an ongoing investigation.
She kept bloody meeting people and inviting them.<eos> I told her she had to stop at some point, but then that's my wife for you, never one to hear the word "no".<eos> Oh, that's great, thanks.<eos> Have you seen Trish?<eos> At the moment, we're not able to discuss anything other than the fact we're investigating a serious sexual assault.<eos> Does Ian know yet?<eos> I'd ask you not to discuss this with anyone else, until we've formally made the news public.<eos> People are already talking.<eos> Make sure you're not one of them.<eos> Why did you have a fight with Ed Burnett at the party?

Why did you have a fight with Ed Burnett at the party?<eos> Oh, you heard about that, did you?<eos> - Your wife mentioned it.<eos> - Oh, did she?<eos> What was that all about?<eos> Just the same stuff we always argue about.<eos> Erm... the way he runs the shop, my wife's shift patterns, the refugee crisis.<eos> Yeah, mostly shift patterns.<eos> He's, erm... a knob.<eos> And how long have you and Cath been married?

Whoo.<eos> 27 years in August.<eos> Hoping for time off for good behaviour.<eos> - Do you fish?
He's, erm... a knob.<eos> And how long have you and Cath been married?<eos> Er... Whoo.<eos> 27 years in August.<eos> Hoping for time off for good behaviour.<eos> - Do you fish?<eos> - No.<eos> No, I tried to, a few times.<eos> Oh, I keep all that there, cos Cath said she didn't want it cluttering up the house and I couldn't bear to get rid of it.<eos> Can you make a time to come down to the station for a full statement about your movements on Saturday night?
Yeah.<eos> Quite a few.<eos> And they'll all be starting to talk amongst themselves and speculating.<eos> Here you go.<eos> All right?<eos> Maggie, sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> Three weeks I've had to wait to get an appointment with you.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> But I'm glad you're here now.
- On the front page?<eos> - It's feel-good and it sells.<eos> It's page five filler.<eos> The lead should be the planning permission given for 300 new homes.<eos> Which moron thought that was better?<eos> I did.<eos> I changed it.<eos> I hope you're ashamed of yourself.<eos> No. I'm not.<eos> You lead on planning or parking or petty crime every week.
You lead on planning or parking or petty crime every week.<eos> We're a paper of record for the life of the town.<eos> That stuff just makes my paper look frivolous and undermines my position as editor.<eos> But then that's been a long time coming.<eos> I've lost my only journalist to a national tabloid.<eos> Now I'm expected to cover every story that happens around here on my own, in a tiny room and with no support.<eos> I know it's been hard.<eos> But you're not gonna be stuck there alone any more.<eos> Oh, well, good.<eos> You're coming to work here.
But you're not gonna be stuck there alone any more.<eos> Oh, well, good.<eos> You're coming to work here.<eos> I don't think so, petal.<eos> The lease on your building's up. We're not renewing.<eos> There's hot-desking capacity for you here.<eos> Not a chance!<eos> I need to be where the stories are, where the people are.<eos> I can't do that from here.<eos> You know how tough print economics are, Maggie.
We're an independent organisation.<eos> We're not part of the police.<eos> We support people who've experienced sexual violence.<eos> There's three strands to what we do. We run a helpline, counselling sessions and then there's ISVAs.<eos> Independent Sexual Violence Advisors, which is me.<eos> I'm not a counsellor, but I can arrange counselling.<eos> My role is to support you through the police investigation and, if it goes to trial, I'll be there all the way.<eos> What I do is completely client-led.<eos> I don't have any agenda, except to help you. OK?<eos> How are you doing so far?

We use the word "client".<eos> Thanks.<eos> Some information leaflets for you to take with you.<eos> We're gonna have regular meetings, so... have a think about how often you'd like.

You do what's right for you.<eos> Don't worry about what anyone else says.<eos> I can come with you to the interview, if that's helpful.<eos> Would you do that?<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm here for whatever you need.<eos> I feel like I'm not in my own body.<eos> I can understand that.<eos> Your mind and your body are not going to be behaving normally.<eos> You might be going through a process of trauma.

We'll come by now and have a quick word.<eos> You know, I don't know if we should be pushing, if Beth says she's not ready.<eos> Beth Latimer is not in charge here!<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Murder I can make sense of.<eos> Sexual offences...<eos> Trish, we're going to release a statement later today about the attack.<eos> It'll be very brief and non-specific.<eos> It won't mention your name or the exact location.<eos> We wanted you to know, in case you saw it mentioned anywhere.

If that's what you want.

- You don't, actually.<eos> Cos it's easy being you, Miller.<eos> I'm the one who's responsible.<eos> I'm the one who has to decide and that's what I've done.<eos> So I don't want to hear any more about it.<eos> Can we just focus on the ex-husband?<eos> We're investigating a serious sexual assault that took place at Axehampton House on Saturday night.<eos> Bloody hell.<eos> What, at... at Cath Atwood's party?<eos> You were there, we understand.

Particularly by Cath.<eos> So she left first.<eos> She got a taxi, I think.<eos> In fact, I know she did, because she had the same driver who'd brought Trish to the party earlier in the evening.<eos> She said she couldn't escape me, even on the way home.<eos> And did you have much to drink?<eos> A bit.<eos> Quite a lot.<eos> Enough to leave the car there.<eos> Oh, so how did you get home?
I... I dunno.<eos> I just remember the light on the top.<eos> As I say, I was... a bit the worse for wear, by that point.<eos> Who got dropped off first?<eos> You or them?<eos> Er...<eos> Me. I think.<eos> Cath Atwood would know who they were?<eos> Presumably, yes.<eos> And you said your wife was at the party?

What do you mean by that?<eos> It's not very nice seeing the woman you used to be married to drunk and cavorting with a lot of strange men.<eos> I mean, by all accounts, she's slept with half a dozen blokes in the last few months.<eos> God knows how many of them were at the party.<eos> It's embarrassing.<eos> Technically, we are still married.<eos> So, we had words outside.<eos> She'd gone out for a cigarette.<eos> Another bone of contention.<eos> So you had an argument?
So, we had words outside.<eos> She'd gone out for a cigarette.<eos> Another bone of contention.<eos> So you had an argument?<eos> I think we probably did, yes.<eos> My memory gets a little bit hazy at that point and I'm sure Trish would say the same.<eos> It was a boozy night all round.<eos> So how did the argument end?<eos> I went back inside.<eos> And you didn't see her for the rest of the night?

- Yeah.<eos> OK. Bye.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Everything all right?<eos> - Nah, I messed up.<eos> How do you do it, Miller, the whole single-parent thing?<eos> By constantly absorbing feelings of failure, guilt and shame.<eos> Look, he's our guy.<eos> The first one in the queue.<eos> Your radio controller told us that you took a fare to the party in Axehampton on Saturday night.

Yeah, and you picked up a fare from, er, West Flintcombe.<eos> Trish Winterman.<eos> She's a regular.<eos> Right.<eos> Do you know her well?<eos> No.<eos> Only through work.<eos> Just her in the back of the cab?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And you got to the gardens when?
Just her in the back of the cab?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And you got to the gardens when?<eos> Twenty-past, half-past eight.<eos> She had me booked for the return journey later that night.<eos> But she never turned up.<eos> I waited for a while.<eos> Tried her mobile.<eos> Took a couple of others back to town instead.<eos> Do you remember their names?

I dropped them a couple of streets from the church.<eos> - You were working all night?<eos> - Till three.<eos> The graveyard shift.<eos> So, we were talking to your radio controller.<eos> She said you developed a fault with your radio halfway through the night and she couldn't contact you.<eos> That's right.<eos> We've been moaning at them to get us new gear for a while.<eos> They say it's too expensive.<eos> How did you work all night without a radio?

I've given my life to it.<eos> What can we do?<eos> Letters?<eos> Petitions?<eos> March on the offices?<eos> Bless you, petal, but I've looked in the eyes of the corporate behemoth.<eos> I think it'd be a waste of breath.<eos> Just be glad you've got a job for life.<eos> People will always need a bit of God.<eos> I wish you were right.

- Shouldn't take long.<eos> - I want it done thoroughly.<eos> Well, I wasn't planning on doing it shitly.<eos> Miller!<eos> Trish is here for her interview.<eos> Thank you, Katie.<eos> God, she really sets my teeth on edge.<eos> Really?<eos> You hide it so well.<eos> Er, Trish, you understand this is the video evidence that will go forward as your definitive statement on what happened, including in court, if the case is taken that far?

Erm... A kind of blue flowery dress over leggings.<eos> Erm... Wedge shoes.<eos> A bit of a blingy thing round my neck.<eos> Dangly earrings.<eos> And what underwear did you have on?<eos> Sorry, Trish.<eos> It's important we have these details.<eos> Er... MS purple bra and pants.<eos> They were new.<eos> How did you get to the party?
I ordered a mini cab from Budmouth Taxis.<eos> - What, a male driver?<eos> - Lucas.<eos> Yeah, he's driven me before.<eos> We'd... er...<eos> We'd actually been for a drink once, sort of by accident.<eos> I think he thought...<eos> I had to turn him down.<eos> This was the first time I'd seen him since.<eos> And who did you talk to at the party?
Everyone.<eos> Oh, we'll need names, please, Trish.<eos> Anyone you can remember, including the women.<eos> There was Cath, obviously, Jim, obviously.<eos> Er...<eos> Ian was there.<eos> I didn't talk to Sarah.<eos> Ed Burnett.<eos> I spent most of the time with a couple of other girls from work, Sally and Tina.<eos> And that's everyone you talked to all night?

Er...<eos> Wine? I dunno.<eos> Er, three, four glasses?<eos> Vodkas?<eos> Two.<eos> Oh, wait, yeah, before I went outside, the girls had, erm... tequila shots.<eos> Two tequila shots.<eos> Sounds a lot when you add it up.<eos> Especially on an empty stomach.<eos> And what time did you go outside?
Oh, wait, yeah, before I went outside, the girls had, erm... tequila shots.<eos> Two tequila shots.<eos> Sounds a lot when you add it up.<eos> Especially on an empty stomach.<eos> And what time did you go outside?<eos> I'm not really sure.<eos> About a quarter to eleven, eleven o'clock?<eos> I wasn't really looking.<eos> They were still serving.<eos> And what happened when you went outside?
Which was it, Trish?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I walked a bit down the path.<eos> And then it felt like I was punched in the back of the head.<eos> Or... Or maybe hit with something.<eos> And did it feel like a fist or the flat of a hand or an object?<eos> Not a flat hand.<eos> No, no, it was more like a...<eos> I don't know, a piece of wood or something.<eos> And what do you remember next?
Not a flat hand.<eos> No, no, it was more like a...<eos> I don't know, a piece of wood or something.<eos> And what do you remember next?<eos> I was on my back with... with my hands tied under me.<eos> I couldn't breathe properly, there was something in my mouth.<eos> Erm... My shoes were off.<eos> My leggings had been pulled down.<eos> And, er... a man... was having sex with me.<eos> Trish, I know this is going to be very difficult, but I need you to explain exactly what you mean by that.
That...<eos> That's the last thing I remember.<eos> And what's the next thing that you do remember?<eos> Walking through a field.<eos> My head was pounding.<eos> The sun was coming up.<eos> My...<eos> My legs were hurting.<eos> Yeah. I think that's how I got home.<eos> Can you tell us what you did when you got home?

I think that's how I got home.<eos> Can you tell us what you did when you got home?<eos> Did you bathe or have anything to drink or clean your teeth?
Can you tell us what you did when you got home?<eos> Did you bathe or have anything to drink or clean your teeth?<eos> No.<eos> And, again, erm... I'm sorry to ask you this, but when was the last time you had sex with a man before this happened?<eos> Do I have to answer that?<eos> Well, it's quite important.<eos> It would really help us.<eos> It was that morning.<eos> Saturday morning.<eos> Can you tell us who it was with?
It would really help us.<eos> It was that morning.<eos> Saturday morning.<eos> Can you tell us who it was with?<eos> Well, it... It's nothing to do with what happened.<eos> - Was it consensual?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And was it protected sex?<eos> - No.<eos> Erm, it would really help us if you could tell us who it...
- No.<eos> Erm, it would really help us if you could tell us who it...<eos> - It's not connected.<eos> - Just to rule them out.<eos> - No.<eos> - Please, Trish.<eos> Right, fine.<eos> It's...<eos> It was a stranger, someone I met online.<eos> - Trish, are you sure?
Previously on Broadchurch...<eos> Trish Winterman of West Flintcombe has made an allegation of rape.<eos> What, so you come for the cab driver?

You did the right thing.<eos> She's gonna be all right, isn't she?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It will take time.<eos> It's from him.<eos> I know it is.<eos> He's got my number.<eos> He must know where I live.<eos> Do you think he's watching us now?<eos> Do you know what it might mean?
Shut up about what?<eos> No idea.<eos> Do you have any sense who the message could be from?<eos> No.<eos> Trish, could this text be from the man that you slept with on the morning you were attacked?<eos> I told you, I'm not talking about him.<eos> But he has your mobile number, right?<eos> It's not him.<eos> We are probably gonna retrieve his DNA from your bed sheets anyway.<eos> It's quicker if you tell us.
We are probably gonna retrieve his DNA from your bed sheets anyway.<eos> It's quicker if you tell us.<eos> Look, I'm sorry I wasn't good enough - in that interview.<eos> - It's not about...<eos> I should be allowed not to tell you.<eos> It was before the attack.<eos> It's not connected.<eos> - We don't know that for sure.<eos> - I know that for sure!<eos> What if you're wrong?

Someone angry with her?<eos> Jealous about something?<eos> Wants to punish her?<eos> Was it just a bit of drunken flirting that turned violent?<eos> With respect, sir, there was no flirting.<eos> He knocked her out.<eos> It was about power and control,<eos> - not sex.<eos> - I know that.<eos> And you were too hard on Trish today at her house.

- The police are gonna check.<eos> - I know.<eos> What do I do?<eos> I don't remember anything.<eos> My wife was being raped, and I don't know where I was.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Is Daisy in?<eos> - Who's asking?<eos> - You her dad?<eos> Who are you?
My wife was being raped, and I don't know where I was.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Is Daisy in?<eos> - Who's asking?<eos> - You her dad?<eos> Who are you?<eos> - She'll be at the park.<eos> - She'll be at school.<eos> What's your names?<eos> I'll make sure she knows you stopped by.
Sooner the better.<eos> We've lots to get through.<eos> Time's against us.<eos> So far, we've interviewed 27 of the guests at the party.<eos> You've all been allocated actions.<eos> I want results on those by the end of today.<eos> Keep taking DNA swabs.<eos> Make a note of all those who refuse to give a sample.<eos> Harford, do the summary board.<eos> I want every man's details and movements before you knock off tonight.
I er...<eos> I have to report these two to you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> And, er... what are they in for, then, a lecture on morality and Bible teachings?<eos> No.<eos> A five-minute talk on why they're idiots, then two hours' hard labour digging up weeds in the churchyard.<eos> It's the school's preferred punishment.<eos> Sounds as though they're not the first.<eos> They are very much not the first.<eos> - How are you doing, all right?
Not into all that bullshit. No offence.<eos> Come on, Fred, playground.<eos> Yeah, come on.<eos> Porn on your phones.<eos> Really?<eos> OK. That's great. Thank you.<eos> What was your fight with Jim Atwood about?<eos> I wouldn't really call it a fight.<eos> Oh, that's how it was described to us.<eos> What, so you think I had a scrap, and then went and raped Trish Winterman?

Thank you.<eos> What was your fight with Jim Atwood about?<eos> I wouldn't really call it a fight.<eos> Oh, that's how it was described to us.<eos> What, so you think I had a scrap, and then went and raped Trish Winterman?<eos> What was the fight about?<eos> Jim likes to tell me when Cath can and can't work.<eos> He was accusing me of putting her on shifts that inconvenience him.<eos> - And you fought over that?
What was the fight about?<eos> Jim likes to tell me when Cath can and can't work.<eos> He was accusing me of putting her on shifts that inconvenience him.<eos> - And you fought over that?<eos> - He winds me up.<eos> He has that crappy little garage, which, by the way, is going down the shitter, but he behaves like he's royalty.<eos> He was having a little dig, and I'd had enough.<eos> So I went over and I offered him out and it all got a bit lairy.<eos> But sometimes you have to draw the line.<eos> And his wife's 50th was the moment you chose?
And his wife's 50th was the moment you chose?<eos> I know what he thought.<eos> I couldn't look after myself.<eos> How did the fight end?<eos> It was like four punches thrown.<eos> That's what I mean.<eos> It was barely anything.<eos> - And what happened then?<eos> - I went home.<eos> - How did you get home?

Don't know anyone who did.<eos> I was around.<eos> Then I went home.<eos> Come on, let's get back to work.<eos> There's plenty to do.<eos> So that camera was in operation on the night of the party?<eos> Yes.<eos> I've put all the footage on here.<eos> It'll show whoever came in or out, this way at least.<eos> You weren't here yourself that night?
It felt more difficult today.<eos> Leaving the house.<eos> I didn't know if I could.<eos> This won't be a straight line.<eos> Some days will feel harder than others for no reason.<eos> I keep thinking about that police interview.<eos> I didn't get it right.<eos> I could see it in their faces.<eos> Your only responsibility is to tell the truth.<eos> Have you spoken to anyone else about the attack
I keep not replying.<eos> Would it be helpful to talk to her?<eos> She's a close friend.<eos> Yeah, but... you know, it was her party.<eos> They'd been organising it for so long and...<eos> And now... now she'll always remember it as the time when this happened.<eos> Trish, that's not your responsibility.<eos> You can't think like that.<eos> We blame ourselves when bad things happen and we shouldn't.<eos> I know who you are, Beth.
And now... now she'll always remember it as the time when this happened.<eos> Trish, that's not your responsibility.<eos> You can't think like that.<eos> We blame ourselves when bad things happen and we shouldn't.<eos> I know who you are, Beth.<eos> I googled you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Right.<eos> That boy who was killed, a few years back, that was your son.<eos> You're Danny's mum.
I know who you are, Beth.<eos> I googled you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Right.<eos> That boy who was killed, a few years back, that was your son.<eos> You're Danny's mum.<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> I am so sorry for what happened to you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't know how you've coped.
Yeah, I am.<eos> I am so sorry for what happened to you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't know how you've coped.<eos> Plenty of days I haven't.<eos> I promised myself, I promised Danny, that I wouldn't give in.<eos> Nothing makes it better.<eos> I'm not gonna lie, Trish.<eos> This is gonna be hard for you.<eos> You're gonna feel so alone.
- on Saturday night?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It was our first big outside do.<eos> Cath comes in here a lot.<eos> She asked if we fancied doing the food.<eos> And how many people did you take with you?<eos> Me and Sami prepared the food, then we had four of our staff take the finger food around.<eos> We cooked it all here during the day, then shipped it over to Axehampton, got there around four, started setting up.<eos> There was a lot of food.<eos> Did you see anything unusual that night, anything out of the ordinary?
What time was the fag break?<eos> Late, er... half 11, 12?<eos> Where did you walk?<eos> Down the lake and back.<eos> Did you see anyone else down there?<eos> No.<eos> We'll need the... the names and details of all your team.<eos> - No problem.<eos> - Just one more thing.<eos> Would you mind if we took, er, a DNA swab?
No.<eos> We'll need the... the names and details of all your team.<eos> - No problem.<eos> - Just one more thing.<eos> Would you mind if we took, er, a DNA swab?<eos> We're taking them from everyone who was there.<eos> We'll do the same with your staff.<eos> It is voluntary.<eos> If that's what you need.<eos> You guys want anything to eat while you're here?
- Hey, thanks for coming.<eos> - That's all right.<eos> Go through.<eos> - Ben?<eos> - Beth!<eos> Chloe!<eos> Good to see you looking so well.<eos> I haven't seen you since court.<eos> - How are you getting along?<eos> - Sorry, why are you here?
- That's all right.<eos> Go through.<eos> - Ben?<eos> - Beth!<eos> Chloe!<eos> Good to see you looking so well.<eos> I haven't seen you since court.<eos> - How are you getting along?<eos> - Sorry, why are you here?<eos> You didn't know I was coming?
God, Mark, stop doing this to us!<eos> - The answer is no!<eos> - At least let's talk about it.<eos> Sorry, when you say private prosecution, that's not open to you.<eos> The case went all the way to a jury.<eos> He was acquitted.<eos> Yeah, but what can we do, then?<eos> I've read about these cases.<eos> Sometimes they go on for years but people do not give up.<eos> If what you're trying to do is hold Mr. Miller to account for Danny's death...

Also, to process a civil suit, you would need to know Mr. Miller's whereabouts.<eos> We'd need an address for him.<eos> He moved.<eos> We heard he changed his name and no-one knows where he is any more.<eos> This is very difficult.<eos> It's almost impossible.<eos> Right, well, there it is, then.<eos> I've never been asked for a DNA swab before.<eos> That's quite cool.<eos> How did you get the booking?
Right, well, there it is, then.<eos> I've never been asked for a DNA swab before.<eos> That's quite cool.<eos> How did you get the booking?<eos> We play the local pubs.<eos> Jim asked us after we played at The Anglers.<eos> Said he'd seen us a few times, and would we do a special set-list for his wife.<eos> Here's our card.<eos> It's got our website on the back.<eos> - Are you any good?

It's got our website on the back.<eos> - Are you any good?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Why, do you want to book us?<eos> - No.<eos> What time did you get there to set up at Axehampton House?<eos> About five.<eos> Well, I was there at five.<eos> The other two turned up about quarter past and Beefy wanders in gone half six.<eos> Who else was about when you were setting up?
They were arguing.<eos> A few bar staff.<eos> That was about it.<eos> What were Cath and Jim arguing about?<eos> Party stuff.<eos> Not enough drink, too much food.<eos> She said she didn't want live music but he'd booked us anyway.<eos> She was fine in the end.<eos> I saw her up dancing.<eos> What did you do straight after your set finished?
No!<eos> Come on!<eos> Hello? Yeah?<eos> It's the woman from the cab company.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Hi, again.<eos> Can we borrow you at the station?<eos> I'm on shift.<eos> We've cleared it with your controller.<eos> So, you like to be known as Lucas, but your first name is actually Clive.

I don't think that's illegal, is it?<eos> When we spoke, you said that your radio was broken<eos> - on Saturday night.<eos> - Yep.<eos> Trish Winterman, who'd booked a return journey with you,<eos> - didn't turn up.<eos> - Correct.<eos> You called her mobile, no reply.<eos> That's right.<eos> Did you go looking for her?
- on Saturday night.<eos> - Yep.<eos> Trish Winterman, who'd booked a return journey with you,<eos> - didn't turn up.<eos> - Correct.<eos> You called her mobile, no reply.<eos> That's right.<eos> Did you go looking for her?<eos> No.<eos> You stayed in the car park at Axehampton, with your light on, you ferried people back and forth.

- That's what you told us.<eos> - That's what I did.<eos> And were any of those people customers like Trish who'd pre-booked?<eos> Some.<eos> - How many?<eos> - Hard to say.<eos> Um, I've got a list from your controller<eos> - of the pre-bookings.<eos> - Right.<eos> Have a look through that and tell us which ones you took.
Have a look through that and tell us which ones you took.<eos> For the tape, er, DS Miller is showing Mr. Lucas form EM43.<eos> It's difficult, you know.<eos> I don't know people's names, just their faces.<eos> Do your best.<eos> OK.<eos> Er... Tony Bird, I took him, the Symes, I took them, and, er...<eos> Sam and Sophie Potter.<eos> That's probably it.<eos> Why are you lying to us, Lucas?
I don't know people's names, just their faces.<eos> Do your best.<eos> OK.<eos> Er...

Sorry?<eos> We called all those people.<eos> You didn't take any of them.<eos> Did you not think we'd check?<eos> Why would you lie about what you were doing on the night a woman was raped?<eos> Look, it's daft, but I picked a fare up off the road.<eos> - What?<eos> - I know we're not supposed to.<eos> Legally.<eos> I thought you were gonna have a go at me for it.
Half nine, ten.<eos> I dropped off this woman, Sarah, who'd left the party early.<eos> I was heading back to Axehampton, turned off the Dorchester road, and that's where he flagged me down.<eos> How old was this man?<eos> 30. Ish.<eos> Which direction was he going?<eos> Away from Axehampton, towards the turning onto the A35.<eos> What sort of mood was he in when he got in the cab?<eos> Grateful.<eos> What address did you take him to?

Ish.<eos> Which direction was he going?<eos> Away from Axehampton, towards the turning onto the A35.<eos> What sort of mood was he in when he got in the cab?<eos> Grateful.<eos> What address did you take him to?<eos> Top of the hill in Lyme, a street on the right.<eos> - But you'd be able to take us back to that street if we asked you?
I misread some signals.<eos> What sort of signals?<eos> She liked to tell me about her life.<eos> I did a couple of airport runs, she'd bring flasks, bit of food.<eos> We got on.<eos> One drop-off, it was late and I just asked her if she was gonna invite me in.<eos> And she looked really scared.<eos> It was the wrong thing to do.<eos> I knew that straightaway.<eos> Are you married, Lucas?

Are you married, Lucas?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Trish told us that you two have been out for a drink.<eos> A date.<eos> You said you only knew her through work.<eos> It was once.<eos> - Why only once?<eos> - We didn't click.<eos> She's older, you know.<eos> At no point, after you dropped her off on Saturday night, did you see Trish Winterman again?
New text.<eos> Number blocked again.<eos> "I'm sorry."<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Lindsay?<eos> Er, DS Miller, DI Hardy, Wessex Police.<eos> Could you spare us two minutes?<eos> It's about your husband.<eos> Er, he came in to make a voluntary witness statement, erm, in relation to an investigation today and we just want to corroborate a few details, if that's OK?<eos> So how long have you been married?
Not just when he's on late shifts.<eos> He sleeps there all the time.<eos> Why's that?<eos> He cheats.<eos> Ten years now he's been cheating.<eos> He thinks he's a good liar.<eos> But he's not.<eos> It's easy to find out.<eos> And they never last long.<eos> Does he know that you know?
He thinks he's a good liar.<eos> But he's not.<eos> It's easy to find out.<eos> And they never last long.<eos> Does he know that you know?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Every time he apologises.<eos> Every time it's the last time.<eos> Every time nothing changes.<eos> So if you don't mind me asking, why stay together?
- We'd need an address for him.<eos> - There it is then, we can't.<eos> No-one knows where he is any more.<eos> That stuff you did to the laptop I gave you.<eos> Can you delete it?<eos> Get me the computer, I'll get it removed.<eos> You have to remember, Trish.<eos> You have to do everything you can to help them catch him.<eos> We're all in danger if you don't.<eos> Are you sure about this, Trish?

- Last night.<eos> - Has she still got the card?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> She showed it to me when I picked her up.<eos> OK.<eos> Thanks, Beth.<eos> So the... the party was in the main room... down here.<eos> But...<eos> The kitchens, they're through there, aren't they?<eos> Did you go into the kitchen, at all?
You made your choice, arsehole.<eos> What are you thinking of, bringing that slag here tonight?<eos> Which way did he go when the argument finished?<eos> I dunno, I'd turned my back on him.<eos> And then, after a few minutes, I heard my name being called.<eos> I think.<eos> And I walked towards the voice.<eos> But you didn't recognise who it was?<eos> Well, I sort of assumed it was Ian.<eos> You didn't hear the person behind you before you were hit?
You didn't hear the person behind you before you were hit?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Only at the last minute.<eos> I...could almost... feel the air moving.<eos> How far did he carry me?<eos> I don't know how close it is.<eos> Are you OK?<eos> That's the sound.<eos> Trish, you don't have to put yourself through this.
- Or a phone.<eos> - Yeah, that's possible.<eos> Where's the owner?<eos> My wife took it upon herself, after your chaps had gone, to have a clear-up.<eos> Mostly stuff the grandchildren leave lying around.<eos> So this was found in your grounds since our crime scene people left?<eos> Yes.<eos> I think it's my wife's way of retaking ownership after what happened.<eos> We've both been rather affected by it.<eos> And you didn't think to tell us you'd found this stuff?
The victim was tied to the bed and gagged.<eos> He pleaded not guilty at the trial, forced the victim to give evidence.<eos> How long was he inside?<eos> Er... 16 months.<eos> Well, he sounds like a delight.<eos> Can't wait to meet him.<eos> Hi. DS Miller, DI Hardy, Wessex Police.<eos> Looking for Aaron.<eos> Can't leave him alone, can you?<eos> Yeah, I read the report, wondered if you'd pitch up here.

DS Miller, DI Hardy, Wessex Police.<eos> Looking for Aaron.<eos> Can't leave him alone, can you?<eos> Yeah, I read the report, wondered if you'd pitch up here.<eos> You're on the register. We'd be remiss not to rule you out.<eos> A woman in her 50s, weren't it?<eos> Did you not even look at the details of my case?
You're on the register. We'd be remiss not to rule you out.<eos> A woman in her 50s, weren't it?<eos> Did you not even look at the details of my case?<eos> Fussy about age, are you?<eos> You don't need to hear this.<eos> All right.<eos> I've served my sentence.<eos> I'm entitled to a fresh start.<eos> No. You're out on parole.<eos> You're still doing your time.
What is it you do now, Aaron?<eos> Data entry.<eos> The company send me boxes of files.<eos> I input the data.<eos> They set me up with it for my release.<eos> - You work from home?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Not many offices would want me in there now, would they?<eos> No.<eos> Where were you last Saturday night?
I go down to the beach, set up, all night.<eos> Me and my dad used to do it, when we were on holiday when I was a kid.<eos> It reminds me of him.<eos> - You get the world to yourself.<eos> - Which beach?<eos> A couple of miles east of town.<eos> Around Flintcombe?<eos> No, not that far.<eos> About halfway between there and Broadchurch.<eos> - How did you get there?
- Which beach?<eos> A couple of miles east of town.<eos> Around Flintcombe?<eos> No, not that far.<eos> About halfway between there and Broadchurch.<eos> - How did you get there?<eos> - Drove.<eos> Where did you park?<eos> A National Trust car park just off the beach.<eos> What time did you leave home?

Was your wife up when you got back?<eos> She'll remember me getting in.<eos> Anyone see you on the beach?<eos> There were a couple of blokes fishing down the beach.<eos> I passed them on my way to set up.<eos> Can I see your fishing equipment?<eos> Welcome to the man cave.<eos> I try and work out, you know.<eos> An hour or two a day, keeps my head clear.<eos> - Do you work out?
Yeah.<eos> - No good?<eos> - Awful.<eos> The whole town's getting jittery.<eos> We're not gonna let this bastard dictate how we live our lives.<eos> So, me and Ed from work thought, you know, a football match on the beach.<eos> Put a smile back on everyone's faces.<eos> I've rung around everyone I know, told them to pass on the word and we'll just pick teams from whoever pitches up.<eos> Do some sort of knockout competition.<eos> You should come.
- Are people coming?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We can still have a bit of fun, can't we?<eos> Otherwise, he wins.<eos> Whoever he is.<eos> And we're not having that.<eos> Oh, I've asked Leah to come, too, as well, just in case...<eos> Anyway, sorry, go on, ask what you need to ask.<eos> Erm...<eos> What time did you arrive at Axehampton house, the night of your party?
What time did you arrive at Axehampton house, the night of your party?<eos> Erm...<eos> Just after six.<eos> Jim said he'd been there most of the afternoon.<eos> And what time did people start arriving?<eos> Half-past seven, which was annoying, actually.<eos> It said eight.<eos> Who turns up early to a thing like that?<eos> It's not like it's at someone's house.<eos> And where were you when people arrived?
It said eight.<eos> Who turns up early to a thing like that?<eos> It's not like it's at someone's house.<eos> And where were you when people arrived?<eos> I was... in... the main bit, you know, the library bit, where the band were playing later.<eos> Could you show us on the diagram?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Erm... So... we were all in here.<eos> Erm, people were coming in and out of that door there and the food was being done there.<eos> You knew everyone on the invite list?

So... we were all in here.<eos> Erm, people were coming in and out of that door there and the food was being done there.<eos> You knew everyone on the invite list?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah. More or less.<eos> There were a few of Jim's business associates, you know, suppliers and stuff, who I'd maybe met just the once.<eos> Did you witness the fight between Jim and Ed Burnett?
Yeah.<eos> Yeah. More or less.<eos> There were a few of Jim's business associates, you know, suppliers and stuff, who I'd maybe met just the once.<eos> Did you witness the fight between Jim and Ed Burnett?<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> I was in the kitchen.<eos> Somebody came running through to get me.<eos> But by the time I got there, it was over and Ed had gone.<eos> When did you start working for Ed Burnett?
No, I didn't.<eos> I was in the kitchen.<eos> Somebody came running through to get me.<eos> But by the time I got there, it was over and Ed had gone.<eos> When did you start working for Ed Burnett?<eos> Er... Four years ago.<eos> They've been bickering about it ever since.<eos> Jim hates me working there.<eos> I wouldn't have to if his bloody garage was doing better.<eos> Could you take us through your movements during the night?
They've been bickering about it ever since.<eos> Jim hates me working there.<eos> I wouldn't have to if his bloody garage was doing better.<eos> Could you take us through your movements during the night?<eos> Yeah. Erm...<eos> I didn't really move much from that room.<eos> Erm, I'd had quite a bit to drink.<eos> I think the waiters were instructed to keep my glass filled up, so...<eos> I was just at the door, you know, watching people come in, taking presents.<eos> Did you see much of Trish Winterman that evening?
Yeah. Erm...<eos> I didn't really move much from that room.<eos> Erm, I'd had quite a bit to drink.<eos> I think the waiters were instructed to keep my glass filled up, so...<eos> I was just at the door, you know, watching people come in, taking presents.<eos> Did you see much of Trish Winterman that evening?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I spent quite a bit of time with her at the beginning.<eos> Then she went off with some of the other girls from work.<eos> Were you aware of her having any problems with anyone?
He wasn't in the main bit and he wasn't in the grounds nearby.<eos> So where do you think he was?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> That's what I'm saying.<eos> You'd have to ask him.<eos> Beth!<eos> Ed Burnett.<eos> - The farm-shop bloke.<eos> - Yeah, I remember you.<eos> Were you waiting for me to come out?
Well, I don't know.<eos> That's what I'm saying.<eos> You'd have to ask him.<eos> Beth!<eos> Ed Burnett.<eos> - The farm-shop bloke.<eos> - Yeah, I remember you.<eos> Were you waiting for me to come out?<eos> Sort of.<eos> Look, I know you're helping Trish.
She's worked for me for years.<eos> - I'm worried for her, that's all.<eos> - I can't discuss her with you.<eos> Then can you pass on a message?<eos> Tell her I'm thinking about her.<eos> We all are. And anything she needs, anything at all, I'm absolutely there for her.<eos> It's not appropriate for me to do that.<eos> Right.<eos> Oh, OK.<eos> - Can't you ask Cath Atwood?
- Yeah.<eos> Do you want a coffee?<eos> - No, I really can't stop.<eos> I just thought, I was driving past, better to let you have it in person, than the vagaries of the post.<eos> I can remember when our postal system was the envy of the world.<eos> Now?<eos> One delivery a day.<eos> - If we're lucky!<eos> - What did you find out?<eos> I got everything you asked for.
- You did well being here.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Mind if I take this?<eos> - This your company's handiwork?<eos> Yep.<eos> I'll get you a discount, if you like.<eos> Come on, Leo, get your arse into gear.<eos> All right?<eos> - Hi.<eos> You two know each other?
- This your company's handiwork?<eos> Yep.<eos> I'll get you a discount, if you like.<eos> Come on, Leo, get your arse into gear.<eos> All right?<eos> - Hi.<eos> You two know each other?<eos> - Yeah, I used to teach him.<eos> That was a bit awkward, Trish making an appearance.<eos> Did you talk to her?
No. It didn't feel... the moment.<eos> A bit public. She's still...<eos> Let me get this out of your way.<eos> Come on, Leo.<eos> Get your end up.<eos> Blue twine on the goals?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We need to check that boy's alibi.<eos> I've just received urgent oral authority from the Superintendent for surveillance on our friend Aaron Mayford.<eos> You and Steve, get to his house till surveillance is organised.
Sit down, please.<eos> - A menu there.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> A drink?<eos> Do you want a drink?<eos> Er... White wine, dry.<eos> Like my men!<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, no, that's...<eos> I'm quite nervous. Are you?
- You've got kids?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That wasn't on there.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> - No.<eos> - Oh, shit, sorry, I didn't...<eos> I mean, there was... It was my daughter who set me up.<eos> So, she did all the swiping?<eos> No, I mean, I chose you based on...<eos> I mean, did I say that, er... you look really nice?
- Did you kiss her?<eos> Have you seen this?<eos> It just came through.<eos> The DNA results.<eos> The swabs they took from Trish Winterman.<eos> We've got a match with one of our men.<eos> Who?<eos> The DNA sample we took from you has come back as a match with the sample we took from Trish Winterman, after she made an allegation of rape.<eos> Well, it's not a match.<eos> You've got it wrong.
Who?<eos> The DNA sample we took from you has come back as a match with the sample we took from Trish Winterman, after she made an allegation of rape.<eos> Well, it's not a match.<eos> You've got it wrong.<eos> It's a positive match, Jim.<eos> No.<eos> It can't be.<eos> How do you explain it, then?<eos> It's a mistake.<eos> So you didn't attack Trish Winterman on the night of Cath's party?
It's a mistake.<eos> So you didn't attack Trish Winterman on the night of Cath's party?<eos> You think that I raped a woman at my own wife's birthday party?<eos> - Did you?<eos> - No. I wouldn't.<eos> She's...<eos> She's what?<eos> Look, Jim, all we want is the truth.<eos> And we will get to it.<eos> If you didn't attack her, why would your DNA be part of her sample?
And we will get to it.<eos> If you didn't attack her, why would your DNA be part of her sample?<eos> Saturday morning... Erm...<eos> The day of the party Trish and me...<eos> We were in bed together.<eos> On the morning of your wife's birthday?<eos> She was at work. Erm...<eos> An early shift.<eos> Right.<eos> Is that the first time you and Trish have slept together?
Yeah.<eos> It was just sex.<eos> Cos me and Cath...<eos> Erm we... we don't... er...<eos> Look...<eos> What I'm saying is, I didn't attack Trish.<eos> Why would I?<eos> If I wanted to have sex with her, I could.<eos> And I did.<eos> Look, you cannot tell Cath.
Yeah.<eos> Fancy going to have a chat with him?<eos> Now-ish?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Are you, er, registered with any websites that enable you to send anonymous text messages?<eos> No.<eos> We know you are, Mr. Winterman.<eos> Well, I'm telling you, I'm not.<eos> I think I'd know.<eos> So you didn't send any messages to Trish, one of which said, "Shut up!
I think it'd be better if you just told us what the text was supposed to mean.<eos> I didn't send any bloody text!<eos> - Well, someone did.<eos> - Yeah, that was possibly me.<eos> Sarah, please say you didn't.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Sarah Elsey.<eos> I work here with Ian.<eos> I'm his girlfriend.<eos> And you're now admitting to sending this text to his wife?
Hi, Bob.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> A woman's just walked in off the street.<eos> I've put her in room No.3. You need to go and talk to her.<eos> Why?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm DI Hardy.<eos> This is DS Miller.<eos> The desk sergeant said you asked to speak to a detective.

Saturday morning, the day of the party,<eos> Trish and me... we were in bed together.<eos> She's my best friend.<eos> If she ever finds out, I...<eos> - Is Daisy in?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> Just tell her the boys came round.<eos> I heard what happened.<eos> I thought maybe you'd need a friend.<eos> What did you find out?

Aaron Mayford, three years for the rape of a woman at a budget hotel.<eos> His victim was tied and gagged, just like Trish.<eos> Two years ago.<eos> In a field, walking home...<eos> He tied me up, put a gag in my mouth.<eos> I was raped.<eos> And I never told anyone.<eos> My name is Laura Benson.<eos> I live at 19 Hazel Grove, Kingsbere.<eos> Why have you come to the station today, Laura?
Do you know who the person was, that did this to you?<eos> No.<eos> I still don't.<eos> And where... where did the attack happen?<eos> I was walking home from the pub.<eos> The Rising Sun, in Abbots Chapel.<eos> There'd been a big do, place was packed.<eos> They had music, late lock-in.<eos> The last of us left around half-three.<eos> And when you left the pub, did you leave alone, or with others?
I still don't.<eos> And where... where did the attack happen?<eos> I was walking home from the pub.<eos> The Rising Sun, in Abbots Chapel.<eos> There'd been a big do, place was packed.<eos> They had music, late lock-in.<eos> The last of us left around half-three.<eos> And when you left the pub, did you leave alone, or with others?<eos> Alone.<eos> What happened when you left the pub?
Do you have any idea how long you were knocked out before you came round?<eos> No.<eos> When I came round, there was something in my mouth.<eos> Like thick material, gagging me.<eos> My hands were tied behind my back and he was on top of me.<eos> He smelt of drink.<eos> - What sort of drink?<eos> - Spirits.<eos> I don't know why I remember that. Cheap spirits.<eos> Are you able to describe him to us?

- Never wore them again.<eos> - Have you still got them?<eos> Did you speak to anyone about the attack at the time?<eos> My GP.<eos> A week or two after.<eos> She told me I should report it.<eos> I told her I didn't want to.<eos> I didn't tell anyone.<eos> Till now.<eos> Why didn't you want to report this at the time?
What made you change your mind today?<eos> I read it in the paper and I was sick in the toilets at work.<eos> I just thought, what if it's him?<eos> What if it's the same man?<eos> I didn't report it, and he's done it to someone else.<eos> I could've stopped it.<eos> If I'd been braver.<eos> I know what she's going through and it's my fault.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You were very brave coming to see us today, Laura.

All right, not fine. Steve was off getting food, and Mayford got in the car with me.<eos> - What?<eos> - Look, the point is, I think we've found something in his work history.<eos> Go on.<eos> The company that Mayford worked for as an IT consultant had contracts with Flintcombe Farm Shop, and Coopers Telemarketing, which is where Laura Benson works.<eos> He has a connection with both women.<eos> Let me do this one.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Hi, Aaron.<eos> We'd like you to come to the station. To answer some questions.
- Hi, Aaron.<eos> We'd like you to come to the station. To answer some questions.<eos> - Who is it?<eos> Who is it?<eos> - Get back inside.<eos> - What for?<eos> - Back!<eos> I don't wanna come.<eos> Aaron Mayford, I'm arresting you in connection with an incident of sexual assault on the 28th of May in the Axehampton area.<eos> You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned, something you later rely on in court.

Understand?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Bit lazy though, isn't it?<eos> You know...<eos> Woman gets raped, you pull in the local rapist.<eos> Even if you don't know the full facts of his story.<eos> We need blood, urine, pubic hair and penile swabs too.<eos> We'll need your written consent.<eos> And if I don't give you my consent?<eos> Any future jury could take a negative inference if you refuse.

As I wasn't in Axehampton, I wouldn't have been near the house, would I?<eos> You drove your own car to go fishing?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - What route did you take?<eos> Same as usual.<eos> Out on the St Andrews Road, onto the coast road, down to the car park.<eos> - Same on the way back?<eos> - Same on the way back.<eos> - That makes sense.<eos> - Glad you're happy.

What about this is annoying to you?<eos> Being victimised again for something I didn't even do in the first place.<eos> What did you catch?<eos> - What?<eos> - What fish did you catch?<eos> - Mackerel.<eos> - How many?<eos> Dozen or so.<eos> It's not difficult.<eos> You could probably do it.

- Who cooks them?<eos> - Me.<eos> You ate all of them the next day?<eos> There were a dozen.<eos> So we had about six or seven.<eos> What did you do with the others?<eos> Froze them.<eos> Why, do you want a couple?<eos> No.<eos> So, if we were to go to your house now, your wife would confirm and back up that you cooked her fresh mackerel on Sunday.

She speaks.<eos> Answer the question, please.<eos> - Dunno.<eos> - Do you know the village I mean?
- Do you know the village I mean?<eos> Yes.<eos> And do you know The Rising Sun pub there?<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> - Never been in there?<eos> Should I have?<eos> It's a yes, no question.<eos> No.<eos> What about Kingsbere?<eos> You ever been to Kingsbere?
- I don't think so.<eos> - Never been in there?<eos> Should I have?<eos> It's a yes, no question.<eos> No.<eos> What about Kingsbere?<eos> You ever been to Kingsbere?<eos> Are you just gonna run through a list of local places?<eos> Answer the question, Aaron, please.<eos> Have you ever been to Kingsbere?
- Few years back?<eos> Yeah.<eos> 2013?<eos> 2014?<eos> Bit before probably.<eos> Ever been to Flintcombe Farm Shop?<eos> Yes.<eos> I used to do the IT support.<eos> The company I worked for had the contract.<eos> - Who did you deal with there?
Ever been to Flintcombe Farm Shop?<eos> Yes.<eos> I used to do the IT support.<eos> The company I worked for had the contract.<eos> - Who did you deal with there?<eos> - The owner.<eos> What was his name, Ed?<eos> Meet any of the other staff there?<eos> No.<eos> And you did some work for Coopers Telemarketing?
Meet any of the other staff there?<eos> No.<eos> And you did some work for Coopers Telemarketing?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, their system was a right old mess.<eos> And was it Laura Benson in charge of their IT contract?<eos> No.<eos> It was a bloke.<eos> Terry somebody.<eos> You didn't have anything to do with Laura Benson?
- Don't be daft.<eos> - How is that daft?<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry if that's daft, Trish.<eos> Only I married him and he's my husband and I think it's a fair question to ask the woman who had sex with him more recently than I have.<eos> Does he... does he know you're telling me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh, Christ!<eos> So you've plan...<eos> You've... you've met him, you have talked...<eos> Since then, you have met my husband and you have planned this.
Just, you know, just get a bit of space.<eos> Anywhere nice?<eos> I was thinking maybe Scotland.<eos> - Lovely.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Going for long?<eos> - Just a couple of days.<eos> Nige can manage things at work.<eos> Long way to go for a couple of days.<eos> You a travel agent now?

Thanks for bringing those, Maggie.<eos> Look after yourself, Mark.<eos> Always.<eos> - Danielle Lawrence?<eos> - Yeah, that's weird. People don't normally know my name.<eos> - We're not after ice cream.<eos> - Speak for yourself.<eos> DS Miller, DI Hardy, Wessex Police.<eos> Oh, OK.<eos> Where were you on the night of Saturday 28th May?
- Danielle Lawrence?<eos> - Yeah, that's weird. People don't normally know my name.<eos> - We're not after ice cream.<eos> - Speak for yourself.<eos> DS Miller, DI Hardy, Wessex Police.<eos> Oh, OK.<eos> Where were you on the night of Saturday 28th May?<eos> Oh, right, yeah.<eos> In the Anglers with my boyfriend, Leo.<eos> - What time did you get there?

- What time did you get there?<eos> - Half seven.<eos> - What time did you leave?<eos> - Midnight.<eos> We got a kebab.<eos> - What sort of kebab?<eos> - Doner.<eos> - Was the kebab shop busy?<eos> - Don't think so, no.<eos> How long have you been going out with Leo Humphries?
- Was the kebab shop busy?<eos> - Don't think so, no.<eos> How long have you been going out with Leo Humphries?<eos> Couple of months.<eos> On and off.<eos> - Do you see him every weekend?<eos> - No, not really.<eos> - Was he with you all night?<eos> - Didn't take my eyes off him.<eos> Whose house did you go back to?
Whose house did you go back to?<eos> His.<eos> His dad was away.<eos> Leo made me breakfast in the morning.<eos> Scrambled eggs.<eos> - Is he a good cook?<eos> - Not really.<eos> Do you mind if I serve these people?<eos> Oh, no, I think we're done.<eos> We'd like to ask you to come to the station to sign a statement confirming what you told us.

I know that.<eos> I get that.<eos> I just thought my life would be that I'd love someone and they'd love me back and it would last my whole life.<eos> Why's that so much to ask?<eos> Brilliant!<eos> Seriously, mate, that is classic.<eos> Breakdown lorry broken down.<eos> Oh, no, don't be an arsehole.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What, you don't want me to tow it for you, then?
- Just by logic.<eos> Why are you so interested?<eos> Well, I dropped some people there and back that night.<eos> Ah, right.<eos> So you were around the place, but you weren't invited?<eos> Yeah, I see what you're doing there.<eos> Ah. Do you?<eos> Funny though. I saw you.<eos> With Trish.<eos> I was parked up, you were out the front, to the side of the house.
He walks in and launches at me.<eos> Slow down.<eos> Who did?<eos> Ed bloody Burnett.<eos> Punching, kicking, he had me pinned on the floor.<eos> Ed Burnett did this to you, out of the blue?<eos> Yeah, out the blue.<eos> Walked in, not a word, had a crack and then he left.<eos> Even bloody took a cloth to wipe his hands on.<eos> You've no idea what this was about?
Even bloody took a cloth to wipe his hands on.<eos> You've no idea what this was about?<eos> Don't start quizzing me.<eos> I'm the victim here.<eos> Get after Ed Burnett and lock that bloody psycho up.<eos> When you find out what this is all about, come and tell me, with a bit of bloody sympathy.<eos> - Quite the pasting he gave him.<eos> - Oh, typical!<eos> A woman gets attacked and the men go round butting horns, making it about them.<eos> - What are you two doing here?

This is a waste of your time.<eos> Did you take a cloth from Jim?<eos> - Dunno what you're talking about.<eos> - I'll stay and look for it.<eos> - Stand up and face the wall.<eos> - Come on.<eos> You don't need those.<eos> I've seen Jim's injuries.<eos> Stand up, please.<eos> What caused you to leave there and head to the garage?
- Come on.<eos> You don't need those.<eos> I've seen Jim's injuries.<eos> Stand up, please.<eos> What caused you to leave there and head to the garage?<eos> I don't want to discuss it.<eos> Mr. Burnett, let's be clear about one thing.<eos> This is not a discussion.<eos> This is a formal police interview, after which we will decide whether or not to charge you.<eos> So anything you have to say in mitigation or explanation as to your actions towards Jim Atwood tonight, say it now.

No, no, no.<eos> You've gotta be kidding me.<eos> Katie, can you get the DI out of the interview room - for me, please?<eos> - You'll have to do it yourself.<eos> Are you refusing to do what I just asked you?<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> You are in so much shit when I get back here.<eos> So Cath Atwood asked you to beat up her husband?<eos> No.<eos> - She knew you were going to?
- Sir, I promise, I...<eos> - No.<eos> Keep your mouth shut.<eos> We have a suspect in custody and you cannot be here.<eos> I understand.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Really?<eos> You understand how you might have screwed this investigation?<eos> If we find out Trish's attacker has any connection to you, this will never stand up in court!<eos> And you will have to answer not only to me, not only to the Chief Super, but to the women that he's attacked.
But she's one of the group I earmarked to go...<eos> To stellar prospects. Yeah.<eos> Brought through on your recommendation.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> So this is my fault?<eos> - Never crossed my mind, ma'am.<eos> If it's any consolation, I think she was just stupid, not bent.<eos> OK.<eos> If I were you, and...<eos> I'm not in any official capacity saying that you should do this...
So this is my fault?<eos> - Never crossed my mind, ma'am.<eos> If it's any consolation, I think she was just stupid, not bent.<eos> OK.<eos> If I were you, and...<eos> I'm not in any official capacity saying that you should do this...<eos> Do the Gold Meeting.<eos> Don't get into any detail with the rest of the team.<eos> And after it, before you make your press statement, go outside, get some air, maybe a coffee...<eos> And if you happen to bump into Katie Harford, which you might, get things straight.

When?<eos> The police are still trying to put it all together, but one woman was raped two years ago and another woman was raped just over a week ago.<eos> Here, do you want to sit down?<eos> I wanted to ask if you would reconsider disclosing some details to the police.<eos> No.<eos> Don't make me relive this.<eos> It could help the current investigation.<eos> It could stop further women - from being attacked.<eos> - Do not put that on me.<eos> Who are you to judge me?
The more help you get, the better the outcome for you.<eos> - I really believe that.<eos> - I'm not changing my mind.<eos> I'm not talking to the police.<eos> All I want to know is what Ed told you and what you told him.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Honestly.<eos> I talked to him as soon as I knew he'd been at the party and he swore he had nothing to do with it.<eos> - And you thought that was fine?<eos> - It's not what you think.
On the night of Saturday 28th May, a 49-year-old woman was knocked unconscious and raped in the grounds of Axehampton House.<eos> We are currently pursuing a number of lines of enquiry.<eos> As a result of the publicity surrounding our investigation... we've received two further historic allegations of rape.<eos> It is possible that all three attacks were carried out by the same perpetrator.<eos> We would ask anyone who has any information relating to either the attack at Axehampton, or any non-recent incidents of sexual assault, to please contact the police in strictest confidence.<eos> We would also like to make it clear to any other women out there who have been sexually assaulted or raped in the past and chose not to disclose those attacks, please come forward.<eos> You will be believed and you will be treated with dignity and respect.<eos> In the meantime, we're urging the local community to remain vigilant and consider their own personal safety.<eos> We are actively pursuing a number of leads.<eos> If you believe you know or have seen or have heard something relevant... please come forward.
I need to know what happened, what you did...<eos> - Mark, you...<eos> - Don't tell me what I need!<eos> I have to know exactly what happened, Joe.<eos> I can't move on.<eos> I can't deal with any of this until I know.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll tell you.<eos> - Oh, please, just go away.<eos> - I think you're wrong.

- I'm just a woman who's angry.<eos> - With me?<eos> With the man who did this to you.<eos> But, yeah, with you, a little bit.<eos> I'm angry because we have to fight this.<eos> We cannot let men get away with doing these things to us.<eos> I don't want that responsibility.<eos> I know you don't.<eos> But tough luck, cos you've got it.<eos> You thought you were the only one he did this to, but you are not.

What? No. N-No, okay?<eos> Okay?

A person, by the way, who has a job now.<eos> Yeah. I am going to be running a company soon.<eos> - Cricks, I love you, but this is so boring.<eos> - You're losing me. Goddamn it!<eos> All right, you know what? Screw you guys.<eos> - Hey, Cricket? Cricket? Cricket!<eos> Cricket, Cricket, calm down, man.<eos> Hey, look.<eos> What?<eos> - You want the lemons or not?
- You want the lemons or not?<eos> - Unbelievable.<eos> - Yes, I'm gonna take the lemons.<eos> Goddamn it. - All right, yeah. - You guys are the worst.<eos> - He wants the lemons. - He needs the lemons. - The guy loves lemons.<eos> He needs the lemons for the scurvy. - Yeah, yeah.<eos> After everything I've done, you know?<eos> After everything they've done to me.<eos> Belle?<eos> What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?<eos> Promise I'm not stalking you.<eos> I'm just out for a walk.<eos> My dad'll be so worried about me, but I just had to get out of the house.<eos> - Ah. - Ever since my mom died, I'm kind of all he's got, so he's become a little overbearing.<eos> Yeah, I get that.<eos> I got an overbearing dad, too.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - My life's the worst.<eos> You're so funny.
Okay.<eos> - And cute.<eos> - Oh, son of a bitch.<eos> Did someone put you up to this?<eos> - No.<eos> Why?<eos> - Look, I am not funny, and I'm sure as shit not cute.<eos> Nobody put me up to this, okay?<eos> I like you.<eos> I do, and I feel like we have more in common than you think.

Wow.<eos> That's great news for you.<eos> And probably bad news for me. I'm running away.<eos> I got to see the world.<eos> I was wondering if you might want to come away with me.
Hey, um... could you just help me with my necklace?<eos> I can never seem to get it off.<eos> Sure.<eos> - Here.<eos> - No, I...<eos> I want you to keep it.<eos> Something to remember me by.<eos> Well, good-bye, Matthew.<eos> Well, here's something to remember me by.<eos> Jesus, Mary and Joseph, what are you doing? !

So...<eos> Let's talk.<eos> I want you back.<eos> I like to re-negotiate terms.<eos> But I don't see how.<eos> Of things you'll not, you said That's the way you are.<eos> But what happened last time. Is not gonna happen again.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> I know that I asked you to, ...show me how far I can go but..<eos> You aren't getting off on the pain you inflicted.

That's still in you.<eos> I'm working on it.<eos> Working on what?<eos> I can't do this if you won't talk to me.<eos> Fine.<eos> Yo, we'll manage.<eos> My birth mother died when I was four.<eos> She was an addict, crack.<eos> You could fill in the blanks.<eos> - Why didn't you tell me that?

But you were asleep at that time.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, umm..<eos> Generally...<eos> A key part of good communication is that both parties be conscious.<eos> I'm really sorry about your mother.<eos> It's in the past.<eos> Now,<eos> I brought you here to negotiate.<eos> You are open to new terms?
No rules.<eos> No punishments.<eos> And..<eos> no more secrets.<eos> I can do that..<eos> You want a...<eos> What do you call it?<eos> A vanilla relationship?<eos> I mean we only do what you are comfortable with.<eos> But you need all these things.
Come on, I'm buying.<eos> - Alright...<eos> Here we go.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Where is everyone?<eos> You know..still early.<eos> Your comments on Voice Fox were interesting.<eos> I'm not usually into political thrillers.<eos> Yeah, well, I think they are parallels with Dante's inferno were amazing but..<eos> Yeah, you convince me.

Thanks.<eos> Another time.<eos> I can't believe you just talked to him like that.<eos> - He wants what's mine.<eos> - What's yours?<eos> It's a little presumptuous.<eos> He is my boss, Christian, You gotta calm down.<eos> Calm isn't really my forte.<eos> I know something that could help.<eos> You know this is not what in mind.

Andrea, good morning.<eos> Could you please transfer $24,000 into the account of Ms Anastasia Steele?<eos> No. What are you doing?

There was just a girl over there and she was outside my office yesterday.<eos> And she knew my name... and she had a bandage on her wrist, it was really strange.<eos> We should go.<eos> - Hey, how you doing?<eos> - Good okay!<eos> Anna!<eos> Is that Mrs. Robinson?<eos> Her name is Elena Lincoln.<eos> I don't care what her name is Christian.<eos> Why would you take me there?
Is that Mrs. Robinson?<eos> Her name is Elena Lincoln.<eos> I don't care what her name is Christian.<eos> Why would you take me there?<eos> Why would you take me to meet the woman who seduced and abused you?<eos> Our relationship ended years ago, we're just friends.<eos> - And business partners.<eos> - Business partners?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Would you take your subs there?
No.<eos> It's not like that.<eos> That girl I saw this morning was one of them, wasn't she?<eos> Let's discuss this back in my place, I can have someone come by, do your hair.<eos> Christian, I don't care about my hair.<eos> Explain to me, what's going on?<eos> I'll explain when we are there.<eos> Come on.<eos> Ok, you either walk or I can carry you.<eos> - You wouldn't do that.
Subject works part time at Claytons Hardware, Richmond Road.<eos> You know, they didn't time my bathroom breaks.<eos> You should probably get your money back.<eos> I had them drawn up in any perspective submissive.<eos> Nice, Jesus.<eos> I had no idea what this was gonna become.<eos> - I didn't know it would be different.<eos> - Different?<eos> Really?<eos> Is that why you brought me to Mrs. Robinson?
Nice, Jesus.<eos> I had no idea what this was gonna become.<eos> - I didn't know it would be different.<eos> - Different?<eos> Really?<eos> Is that why you brought me to Mrs. Robinson?<eos> Where you brought all the other women because I'm so different?<eos> - That was wrong, I admit.<eos> - It's all wrong, all of this is wrong.<eos> You put money into my account. That I don't want it.

I'm sorry?<eos> Elena.<eos> I wanted to meet you.<eos> - I can't say the same, excuse me.<eos> - Hey, I'm not the enemy.<eos> I know what you did to Christian.<eos> All I did was to lead him to the truth of who he really is.<eos> Without me, he'd be in jail. Or dead.<eos> And he would say the same.<eos> Do you think you're the first woman he'd hoped to save him?
All I did was to lead him to the truth of who he really is.<eos> Without me, he'd be in jail. Or dead.<eos> And he would say the same.<eos> Do you think you're the first woman he'd hoped to save him?<eos> He needs a submissive in life.<eos> Not just in the bed room.<eos> No, he's changing that.<eos> It's not he wants anymore.<eos> But it's what he needs.<eos> And you don't strike me as the type of women who wants to be owned.

The view is probably amazing.<eos> I wonder who lives there.<eos> It's an old sea widow. Lost her husband years ago.<eos> She sits at the window every night, waiting for him to come home.<eos> - Did you just make that up?
I'm the captain. just wanna keep callin' your name Until you come back home I just wanna keep callin' your name Until you come back home<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey Jack.<eos> Personal calls on your own time okay?<eos> Ya?<eos> Did you get my message?<eos> You had a phone call this morning with Rick Crussi at 9am.<eos> Shit.<eos> I just gonna reschedule that. I'll ask them.<eos> Did you book our rooms? For New York Camp?
Does she come in here a lot?<eos> To dust.. dust.<eos> Dust in here?<eos> It's even more intense when you take 'em off.<eos> What's this?<eos> Ok, that's enough show and tell.<eos> What's this?<eos> Let's learn to walk before we run.<eos> I kinda like running.<eos> Last time we did this. You saw another side of me. And you left.

Who I would like to impress.<eos> You know he's had 3 assistants in the last 18 months.<eos> All of them quit.<eos> - Without notice. - You don't think I can handle him?<eos> That's not it.<eos> That's what it feels like.<eos> Anna, I know full well that you can handle anything. And if you really wanna go, then I can't stop you.
I'm just not seeing the initiative on your side of it.<eos> I've read more that you ask me to.<eos> - And I'm on top of.<eos> - I'm talking about. Going the extra mile Unless you want me too. Compete with Christian Grey.<eos> For your attention.<eos> I apologize that Christian was so curt with you the other night.<eos> Is that what this is about?<eos> Your boyfriend has a reputation for being.. a little ruthless. Is that what you like?<eos> If you have problem with my work, then you should take it up with HR.<eos> Why are you being so serious?

He lets you call him by his name.<eos> He talks about you all the time.<eos> He cares about you.<eos> Don't lie.<eos> Tell me what you have that I don't.<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'm nothing.<eos> He'll get tired of me.<eos> Master sleeps in your bed.<eos> - How do you know that?

Taylor, get her outta here.<eos> Miss Steele.<eos> - Miss Steele?<eos> Anna?<eos> - Stop it, Taylor.<eos> I don't care.<eos> She's been gone for 3 hours, she doesn't have her cell.<eos> Or her purse.<eos> Forget it, she's here.<eos> Where the fuck have you been?
Or her purse.<eos> Forget it, she's here.<eos> Where the fuck have you been?<eos> I told you to come straight here.<eos> I have had people out combing the streets looking for you.<eos> I'm sorry I don't always do as I'm told.<eos> Maybe you just really need someone who obeys every command.<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> I saw you. Christian.<eos> I saw the way you were with Leila.
Kind of submission and obedience.<eos> Anna.<eos> Don't crowd me.<eos> I need space.<eos> - Now please don't do this.<eos> - Christian.<eos> - Don't give up on me.<eos> - I just need to think a little bit.<eos> Don't leave me.<eos> What are you doing?
- Don't give up on me.<eos> - I just need to think a little bit.<eos> Don't leave me.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Get up.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> I know you say that I'm enough.
Don't leave me.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Get up.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> I know you say that I'm enough.<eos> But there are certain things that you're used to getting. That I will never ever ever be able to give you.<eos> And it might be fine for right now, but.. What's gonna happen when you start needing them again?

And it might be fine for right now, but.. What's gonna happen when you start needing them again?<eos> I won't.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> How can I believe you, I don't even understand your need to dominate.<eos> I'm not a dominant. I'm not. The right term is a sadist?<eos> I get off in punishing woman. Woman who look like you.<eos> Like your mother.<eos> Yes.<eos> And I know how fucked up that is.<eos> When you left, I swore that I would stop if that's what it took to get you back.

- I'm all yours.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Hey.. hey.. hey.. hey..<eos> It's okay. I'm right here.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Marry me.<eos> - What?<eos> - I want you to marry me.<eos> Christian. I think you're dreaming.
That better?<eos> I meant it.<eos> I want to marry you.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I want to spend every second of the rest of my life with you.<eos> I don't expect you to say yes right away.<eos> I know I'm complicated.<eos> Just a little bit.<eos> You have an assistant?<eos> I thought you were an assistant.
- Do you have a gift-box?<eos> - One second.<eos> Hey.<eos> Ms Steele.<eos> How's your day?<eos> Looking up, Mr Grey.<eos> Where's Taylor?<eos> He went to get my bag.<eos> Your bag?<eos> Where you going?
Ms Steele.<eos> How's your day?<eos> Looking up, Mr Grey.<eos> Where's Taylor?<eos> He went to get my bag.<eos> Your bag?<eos> Where you going?<eos> Ross and I have to go to Portland for some meetings.<eos> I'll be back tomorrow night.<eos> When are you going to tell me about your birthday?
Oh no.<eos> Christian.<eos> What's going on?<eos> - Mayday!<eos> Mayday! Mayday!<eos> - What's happening?<eos> Stop it.<eos> Hold tight. Hold tight.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Oh my god, you're so tanned.
I'll get you a sweater.<eos> Okay.<eos> Anna.<eos> Tea?<eos> He's gonna be fine.<eos> He has to be okay.<eos> We haven't had any time.<eos> We need to have more time.<eos> You are going to have plenty of time.<eos> We're still glad that you're here with us. And in Christian's life.
I know. But children grown out of their parents and that's.. that's fine.<eos> As long as they're happy.<eos> And he.. is happy.. with you.<eos> And that's all I ever wanted.<eos> Turn it up.<eos> That Christian Grey and his colleague Ros Bailey have been found safe and well and at this moment on their way back to Seattle.<eos> What the hell y'all doing here?<eos> Christian.<eos> Oh my god.<eos> Christian.. how did you get here?

So how does it feel to Seattle's most eligible bachelor?<eos> It's a little scary but...<eos> If anyone can make it work, it's you.<eos> Hey, sis-in-law.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Christian's a very lucky guy.<eos> ...You however are certified<eos> Sorry to interrupt, Mia wants to taste one of your killer cocktails.<eos> Oh, coming right up.<eos> Nice to see you hid it on our little talk.
What makes you think that I would ever listen to you?<eos> You don't care about Christian.<eos> he will see to that.<eos> I'll make sure of it.<eos> He'll see right through you.<eos> It's over for you... Elena.<eos> You're just a mousy little thing after his money.<eos> He's not capable of marriage.<eos> Thank you, Christian.<eos> Why're you even here Elena?

Elena.<eos> You're just a mousy little thing after his money.<eos> He's not capable of marriage.<eos> Thank you, Christian.<eos> Why're you even here Elena?<eos> - She's not right for you.<eos> - You don't know what's right for me.<eos> You tell me how to fuck Elena.
- Are you?<eos> - No... No.<eos> What's that you got there?<eos> Come with me.<eos> There is something I need to show you.<eos> Last time we came down here. I was over your shoulder.<eos> Oh yeah.<eos> After you.<eos> Oh my God!<eos> - You want a bunch of flowers?
It's okay.<eos> ...Christian.<eos> This is amazing.<eos> Be mine.<eos> Share my life with me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Marry me.<eos> Oh baby.<eos> Alright.<eos> Did you do that? Translation and subtitles by PEPPER LALASPAIN *** SONG LIVES FOR EVER ***
Here they are now.<eos> Thanks for getting here so quick.<eos> Why's she on the steps?<eos> She came to report, but the front desk was shut.<eos> She phoned 101 from a payphone round the corner.<eos> - Why didn't you take her in?
- Hi, Dad, it's only me.<eos> Oh, er... are you on your way home?<eos> Er... not yet.<eos> Something's come up.<eos> - Doesn't it always?<eos> - Yep.<eos> So, look, I... I don't know when I'll be back.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Have you got Fred to bed OK?<eos> Could you er... pick up a loaf on your way home?
- Yeah, all right.<eos> See you, then.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> - How's your dad?<eos> - Infuriating.<eos> How long is he gonna stay?<eos> We haven't discussed it.<eos> Still, free childcare though, eh?<eos> Is she still in there?<eos> Did you see the injury on the back of her head?
How long is he gonna stay?<eos> We haven't discussed it.<eos> Still, free childcare though, eh?<eos> Is she still in there?<eos> Did you see the injury on the back of her head?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And marks around both wrists.<eos> She's not carrying any ID, or a mobile.<eos> - So still no surname.<eos> - Do you not know her?
Why did she not report it sooner?<eos> Why did she come home?<eos> Everyone responds differently.<eos> We've already lost... 60 hours?<eos> If the attack happened at the party, that's a long list of people to interview and eliminate and the attacker's still out there.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Ellie?<eos> - Trish?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Are you OK, Trish?
Don't be afraid to use it.<eos> And you can call me any time.<eos> How am I gonna tell my daughter?<eos> Look, try not to think of that for now.<eos> OK, we're gonna take all this one step at a time and there'll be plenty of us around to support you.<eos> OK.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - OK.<eos> Bye, Trish.<eos> - You gave her your number.
- So what?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> - Your personal number!<eos> - What have I told you?<eos> - She needed it.<eos> - Every time!<eos> - Pardon me for being human.<eos> We investigate, support services support!<eos> - Support services aren't there.<eos> - You can't do this.
- Every time!<eos> - Pardon me for being human.<eos> We investigate, support services support!<eos> - Support services aren't there.<eos> - You can't do this.<eos> - Once before.<eos> - Twice before.<eos> - Oh, are you keeping count?<eos> - Yes!<eos> If I'm so annoying, why did you come back?

I didn't know this was out here.<eos> - What is it, part of a village?<eos> - No, it's an old manor house, with a few cottages nearby that used to be for estate workers.<eos> Oh, and there's a little church.<eos> But there's no shops or services, or anything like that.<eos> "Axehampton House is available for private hire for weddings, birthdays and anniversaries."<eos> Not today, it's not.<eos> It's not gated, so anyone can just drive up here.<eos> There's another road in, on the other side, by the house.<eos> - What are you doing?

Aha!<eos> Oh, God, what's that?<eos> It's a goodie bar.<eos> I keep them handy for Fred.<eos> - How long's that been in there?<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - Ooh! Do you want half?<eos> - No.<eos> Wait.<eos> Do you hear that?
How are you finding things?<eos> Good, I think.<eos> Sort of.<eos> It varies. Erm...<eos> Karen, my last one, that was tricky.<eos> I don't think I handled that brilliantly.<eos> Karen's vulnerable.<eos> She has had an incredibly hard life.<eos> I feel bad for letting it get to me, cos I knew it'd be difficult, but, it's just, sometimes,<eos> Listen, everyone who's worked here has been where you are now.

Even after three years.<eos> Why don't you go in there?
Why don't you go in there?<eos> It was your decision to do the book.<eos> Biggest mistake of my life.<eos> It's done more harm than good.<eos> Hello, petal.<eos> Thank you for waiting.<eos> Could you sign it to Tony, please?<eos> God's sake, Mark!<eos> Sorry, Paul.<eos> Look, I understand you're regretting it now, but skulking in the bushes watching isn't gonna help.

Sorry, Brian.<eos> And you wonder why we call him Shit Face.<eos> Let us know what you find.<eos> - This is where Trish works?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We'll let them know she won't be in for a while.<eos> Can I ask you a question, Miller?<eos> Course.<eos> How long have they been calling me Shit Face?<eos> Since you first arrived.
She was knocked unconscious somewhere within the grounds and was raped, possibly close to the lake.<eos> It's unclear whether her attacker was known to her.<eos> Myself and DS Miller took her to the SARC in Poole last night.<eos> We're awaiting preliminary forensics and SOCO are starting work at the scene now.<eos> - When did she report this?<eos> - Last night.<eos> But the attack happened on Saturday.<eos> It's a bit of a gap.<eos> Are we sure she's genuine?<eos> When you've completed your Sexual Offences training, Katie, you'll understand we start from a position of believing the victim.

Once we've got initial forensics, we'll make a call on the risk to public safety.<eos> In the meantime, not a word gets out.<eos> Sorry, sorry!<eos> Hello?<eos> Yep, this is Mrs. Miller.<eos> Why? What's the matter?<eos> What?<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> He's so sorry.<eos> - Aren't you, so sorry?
Sorry, sorry!<eos> Hello?<eos> Yep, this is Mrs. Miller.<eos> Why? What's the matter?<eos> What?<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> He's so sorry.<eos> - Aren't you, so sorry?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Where did you get this?
- I'm sure we all understand how tough it has been for you as a family...<eos> No, no, no, don't say that.<eos> It isn't about that.<eos> It isn't.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Tom!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> You're 15!<eos> Well, everyone watches this stuff.<eos> You are not everyone.
No, no, no, don't say that.<eos> It isn't about that.<eos> It isn't.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Tom!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> You're 15!<eos> Well, everyone watches this stuff.<eos> You are not everyone.<eos> You have to be better than that.
- No.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - How's the homework?<eos> - All done.<eos> I'm gonna hang out in town with the guys for a bit, maybe go round one of their houses.<eos> - "The guys"?<eos> Which guys?<eos> - Over there.<eos> I'll be back by ten.<eos> You'll still be at work, anyway.
- Dad, what's going on?<eos> - Just be careful, OK?<eos> Don't mention this to your mates.<eos> - Well, thanks for freaking me out.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> See you later.<eos> Yeah, what's up, Cath?<eos> Trish was raped at our party on Saturday night.<eos> What?<eos> But how do you know?
She's not answering.<eos> Do you think I should go round?<eos> I dunno.<eos> If she's not answering to you, she probably wants to be on her own.<eos> I ju...<eos> I just feel like it's our fault.<eos> - How was your English exam, Chlo?<eos> - It was all right, I suppose.<eos> Had none of the questions they told us to prepare.<eos> I'm sure you did your best.
- Definitely.<eos> How was your day, Mum?<eos> Had my appraisal today.<eos> Seemed to go all right.<eos> And I got a new client.<eos> Haven't seen her yet.<eos> - She doesn't live too far so...<eos> - Well, that's not good.<eos> A woman nearby got attacked?<eos> You know I'm not supposed to talk about it.
There was something in my mouth.<eos> He'd put something in there, to gag me.<eos> I thought I was going to suffocate.<eos> And I started to choke and... and he knew I was coming round, so he put his arm over my eyes, so I couldn't see him.<eos> And then, I...<eos> I think I passed out.<eos> When I woke up again, the thing in my mouth was gone and my hands weren't tied.<eos> This is all really useful stuff, Trish.<eos> Why did he choose me?<eos> What the hell are you doing here?

Hey!<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's move!<eos> No!<eos> - Let me see.<eos> - No!<eos> Come on.<eos> I made you a special breakfast.<eos> You can't cook.

You won't take care of him.<eos> You don't like cats.<eos> I don't like two-eyed cats.<eos> Fred, as you know, is monocular.<eos> Who's gonna throw him his ping pong ball?<eos> Fred's gonna be fine.<eos> No more argument, okay?<eos> We've discussed this ad nauseam.<eos> What's ad nauseam?<eos> Oh, you don't know?

You know, just...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Try being' a kid.<eos> Frank!<eos> Frank, I know you hear me.<eos> Frank!<eos> There's still time for you to undo this nonsense.<eos> Go get in your car and go get that child.<eos> Are you technically allowed to use those keys whenever you want?<eos> How can you stand there... acting all calm and everything, Frank, and make light of this?
Now go get her back before it's too late.<eos> She gotta get out in the world.<eos> She has no friends her age.<eos> No social skills.<eos> She doesn't know how to be a kid.<eos> Two nights ago, she told me that even if Germany balls out the euro... there could still be a worldwide depression.<eos> I was staring at the ceiling for three hours.<eos> I'm so worried.<eos> Come on, Roberta.<eos> If you start crying, I'm gonna have to pretend to start crying.

What kinda school is this anyway?<eos> It's the kind of school where students don't speak without permission.<eos> All right.<eos> But everyone knows it's six.<eos> Nobody in this classroom speaks... unless they are called upon.<eos> Okay?<eos> Is everybody clear on that?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Good.<eos> Mary, can you stand up please?

That's good.<eos> What is... 15 plus 17?<eos> 32.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That is right.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Well, what is 57 plus 135?<eos> 192.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can you tell me... what 57 multiplied by 135 is?
She's the boss?<eos> Mrs. Davis is our principal. Mm-kay...<eos> Okay.<eos> Now I want you to get on your phone and call Frank... and tell him to get me out of here!<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> That's the dad?<eos> I know him.<eos> I see him at Ferg's almost every Friday night.<eos> He's the quiet, damaged hot guy.<eos> What are you doing at Ferg's every Friday night?
Nice to meet you.<eos> Bonnie.<eos> Frank.<eos> For the record, I didn't wanna go to the stupid school in the first place.<eos> And the boy in the next row acts inappropriately for someone who's a child.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm still passive aggressively ignoring you.<eos> Other kids answer questions. They don't get into trouble.<eos> You didn't get in trouble for answering questions.<eos> You yelled at the principal.

Do you think maybe this boat needs a test ride?<eos> Go get Fred.<eos> Don't run.<eos> Fred loves to watch the sandpipers.<eos> He thinks he'd like to catch one... but he'd regret it.<eos> Fred's not a killer.<eos> He's a lover.<eos> Would my mom have wanted me to go to this school?<eos> I can only guess.<eos> But I'll tell you what, she would have wanted you to have friends.

Like she's...<eos> - She's from England.<eos> From England.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, Mary is a genius?<eos> Look out.<eos> Look out.<eos> Your little animals are escaping, dumbass.<eos> Hey!<eos> You should not be laughing!

Well, just dumb her down into a decent human being.<eos> Everybody wins.<eos> You know what?<eos> Can you excuse me one minute?<eos> Bring me every piece of paperwork we have on this girl.<eos> Hey.<eos> Are you sure you know what you're doing?<eos> No.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mary, I think you have something you'd like to say to the class.
I'm seven.<eos> That would be your grandmother.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> An Apple?<eos> It's a MacBook, darling.<eos> Top of the line with the Retina Display.<eos> Hey, you know who else has a Retina Display?<eos> Fred!<eos> Mary, I understand you like mathematics.<eos> So, on there, you'll find a great out-of-print book by Charles Zimmer called Transitions in Advanced Algebra.

There's so much more on there.<eos> Things I know you'll find really challenging. Yes.<eos> But sadly, it's a school night and there's homework to do.<eos> What a surprise though, right?<eos> Say good night to Grandmother or Evelyn.<eos> Good night.<eos> I'd kill a priest for a Benadryl.<eos> Still with the allergies?<eos> Why in God's name have you got a cat?<eos> You don't even like cats.
Why in God's name have you got a cat?<eos> You don't even like cats.<eos> It's not my cat.<eos> It's Mary's cat.<eos> I'm just along for the ride.<eos> So let me guess.<eos> Our lovely principal, Ms. Davis.<eos> Never get on the bad side of small-minded people who have a little authority.<eos> I thought I taught you that.<eos> What are you doin' here?

I don't think this is an appropriate time to talk.<eos> Certainly not the setting.<eos> While I was waiting, a cockroach this big tried to steal my shoe.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They'll take a shoe.<eos> Honestly, this?<eos> This godforsaken mosquito ranch was a conscious choice?<eos> I could drop you back off at the airport.<eos> This thing is loaded with cool problems.<eos> So, are you teaching?
I repair boats.<eos> - Please.<eos> - I'm not bad at it either.<eos> Well, then, that explains this.<eos> They don't sell sunscreen here?<eos> I wear sunscreen.<eos> Not enough.<eos> And you need a hat.<eos> A big hat that shades your face and neck.<eos> You're playing Russian roulette with your skin.

That's a shame.<eos> Okay.<eos> The environment you have created for that child where she lives, the school she attends, it's substandard, every bit of it.
Okay.<eos> The environment you have created for that child where she lives, the school she attends, it's substandard, every bit of it.<eos> I disagree.<eos> We're getting nowhere if we're not gonna be honest with each other.<eos> I am being honest.<eos> I see. Fine.<eos> Well, I'm not leaving without her.<eos> Well, welcome to Florida.<eos> Frank, please listen to reason.<eos> At some point, either you're gonna come to the conclusion, or someone in authority is going to spell it out for you that the child's best interest is all that matters.
Frank, please listen to reason.<eos> At some point, either you're gonna come to the conclusion, or someone in authority is going to spell it out for you that the child's best interest is all that matters.<eos> You're gonna make me pull rank, I will.<eos> Diane didn't want you to have her.<eos> Diane...<eos> Diane didn't always think things through.<eos> Arguably one of the brightest minds on the planet.<eos> Good luck going down that road.<eos> And what do you think she'd say if she saw how her child is living now?<eos> Do you honestly think she'd be pleased?
Arguably one of the brightest minds on the planet.<eos> Good luck going down that road.<eos> And what do you think she'd say if she saw how her child is living now?<eos> Do you honestly think she'd be pleased?<eos> That she's living a somewhat normal life?<eos> Yes. I do.<eos> She's not normal.<eos> And treating her as such... is negligence on a grand scale.<eos> I know your heart's in the right place on this.<eos> But you are denying the girl her potential.

That's why I have Mary in the first place.<eos> That's uncalled for.<eos> Your sister had a laundry list of problems.<eos> She could have solved Navier-Stokes and gone down in history... as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time.<eos> But she didn't because she couldn't finish.<eos> She was weak.<eos> Weak like her father and weak like...<eos> Well...<eos> Now, if it's who I think it is... Kinda puts a black cloud over our luncheon.<eos> You're still stubborn and vindictive.
I could be wrong.<eos> So why would I screw up yours?<eos> Use your head.<eos> But don't be afraid to believe in things either.<eos> There was a guy on TV who said there was no God.<eos> The only difference between the atheists on TV and Roberta... is that Roberta loves you.<eos> She's trying to help.<eos> Tell you what though.<eos> One way or another, we all end up back together in the end.<eos> That's what you're asking, right?
Drive carefully.<eos> Her lawyer has a nice suit.<eos> Relax, Frank.<eos> More weight's put on the talent competition.<eos> Go have a cocktail, hmm?<eos> Roberta, would you like to have Mary tonight?<eos> Why wouldn't I like to have Mary tonight?<eos> I told you something like this would happen.<eos> Now look where we are.<eos> And I'm supposed to believe you know what you're doing.

- I'm sorry.<eos> The point is that he's evil in his core.<eos> And there's nothing I can do.<eos> Wow.<eos> What's your greatest fear?<eos> Wow!<eos> That's a change of tone.<eos> Yup, I'm a really serious person.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look, if it's too much, you can just drink your drink... and live with the fact that you're afraid.

I'll take you home.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry, just...<eos> One more time.<eos> I can't find my DVD.<eos> It's right there, baby.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> You come and find it.<eos> I'm doing lady business.<eos> Now, you were the last person to watch it.
Yeah.<eos> Sorry, just...<eos> One more time.<eos> I can't find my DVD.<eos> It's right there, baby.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> You come and find it.<eos> I'm doing lady business.<eos> Now, you were the last person to watch it.<eos> What did you do with it?
- No!<eos> Are you allowed to...<eos> Hey!<eos> Stop!<eos> Enough with the Legos.<eos> Are you allowed to use Roberta's keys?<eos> - No.<eos> - No!<eos> Hey! Look at me.<eos> Then why are you here, huh?
Are you allowed to...<eos> Hey!<eos> Stop!<eos> Enough with the Legos.<eos> Are you allowed to use Roberta's keys?<eos> - No.<eos> - No!<eos> Hey! Look at me.<eos> Then why are you here, huh?<eos> Can you answer me that?
Hey!<eos> Stop!<eos> Enough with the Legos.<eos> Are you allowed to use Roberta's keys?<eos> - No.<eos> - No!<eos> Hey! Look at me.<eos> Then why are you here, huh?<eos> Can you answer me that?<eos> You broke every rule!
Stop!<eos> Enough with the Legos.<eos> Are you allowed to use Roberta's keys?<eos> - No.<eos> - No!<eos> Hey! Look at me.<eos> Then why are you here, huh?<eos> Can you answer me that?<eos> You broke every rule!<eos> You just embarrassed me.
We've gone over them a hundred times! Ahh!<eos> God!<eos> Damn it!<eos> Can I just get five minutes of my own life?<eos> Nothing that happened today was your fault.<eos> I got mad at you...<eos> I was really mad at me.<eos> And the manufacturers of Legos, they should all be in prison.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Do you forgive me?
Sure.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Hey, close the laptop.<eos> Come on.<eos> Please.<eos> Doesn't count if it's not eye to eye.<eos> Come on, please.<eos> Do you really have no life because of me?<eos> That's not what I said.<eos> Did you mean it?
Whatever.<eos> Hey, close the laptop.<eos> Come on.<eos> Please.<eos> Doesn't count if it's not eye to eye.<eos> Come on, please.<eos> Do you really have no life because of me?<eos> That's not what I said.<eos> Did you mean it?<eos> Last month you said I was the worst uncle in the world... and you wished death upon me 'cause I didn't buy you a piano.

Where is this?<eos> That's Cambridge University.<eos> In England.<eos> Who are those people?<eos> My research colleagues.<eos> For what?<eos> Mathematics, of course.<eos> Really?<eos> Cool!<eos> So, then you came to work... at a college in America?
This is your mother's problem.<eos> Na... vi...<eos> Navier-Stokes.<eos> No picture.<eos> - She didn't solve it?<eos> - No.<eos> She was close.<eos> She would have won the Fields Medal... and probably shared a Nobel... considering what it would have meant for physics.<eos> Maybe I'll have my picture up here someday.<eos> If you really desire it... you can have your picture there, darling.
Don't be smug, Seymore.<eos> Well, she's had plenty of time.<eos> She traveled yesterday.<eos> She slept in a strange bed.<eos> Give her a chance.<eos> At six years old, she read Zimmer.<eos> Outstanding.<eos> How much did she comprehend?<eos> So, Mary...<eos> I see you're looking at our little problem.

Yeah.<eos> Why are you so mad all of a sudden?<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> I'm annoyed.<eos> Not with you, dear.<eos> With that pompous ass, Shankland.<eos> I knew that guy was gonna have a beard before we even went in there.<eos> Math teachers like to grow beards.<eos> I should never have agreed to this in the first place.<eos> Did he really expect you to just walk in and be able to dissect... some random, massive problem?

Mary.<eos> I like Evelyn.<eos> She looks like my mom.<eos> And she has a piano.<eos> But I don't wanna live with her.<eos> She's bossy.<eos> I've heard that.<eos> Hey.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You're not going anywhere.
I've heard that.<eos> Hey.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> Promise?<eos> I promise.<eos> Hi, Mary.<eos> I'm Pat Golding, but you can call me Pat if you like.<eos> Got it.<eos> Do you know why you're here?
Got it.<eos> Do you know why you're here?<eos> I mean has anyone told you what this is about?<eos> My grandmother wants me to live with her and I wanna stay with Frank.<eos> That's correct.<eos> I'm sure this can all be very scary stuff.<eos> Does any of it worry you?<eos> Nope.<eos> Frank says I'm not goin' anywhere.<eos> Your uncle told you you're not going anywhere?
Okay.<eos> I don't watch TV.<eos> But I got hooked on SpongeBob.<eos> Mostly because Roberta loves it.<eos> And on Saturday nights, we watch the UFC.<eos> The UFC?<eos> Is that...<eos> Is that Ultimate Fighting?<eos> Every Saturday.<eos> You and your uncle watch Ultimate Fighting?
Every Saturday.<eos> You and your uncle watch Ultimate Fighting?<eos> Well, you don't just watch it.<eos> Frank turns the sound down and we do the grunting and voices.<eos> Sometimes I attack Frank for real.<eos> Which is really fun for me.<eos> I think if you guys knew Frank, you'd leave us alone.<eos> He can be pretty annoying... but he's a good person.<eos> I think.<eos> Why do you say that?
- Your Honor, this is...<eos> - Your Honor... if there's one thing here that's sadly obvious... it's that Mr. Pollard has never been a genuine guardian of the minor... and his nomination of Mrs. Adler is no less disingenuous.<eos> While the State of Florida gives deference to nomination by a natural parent... I'm inclined to side with Mr. Cullen's laptop... at this time.<eos> Thank you, Your Honor.<eos> Don't gloat.<eos> Wouldn't dream of it.<eos> Walk you to your car?<eos> We've been so preoccupied, I'm almost ashamed to ask.<eos> How's Walter?<eos> You wouldn't believe it if I told you.
I hate it that we're at odds.<eos> We're always at odds.<eos> Yes.<eos> Hotel.<eos> Mary, baby, come on now.<eos> Stop this now.<eos> No.<eos> - Come on out, honey.<eos> - No.<eos> Why did you have to tell her that deadbeat was testifying?
Stop this now.<eos> No.<eos> - Come on out, honey.<eos> - No.<eos> Why did you have to tell her that deadbeat was testifying?<eos> Because it's the truth.<eos> And if I didn't, Evelyn would've.<eos> If I was the dad of a little girl and I never saw her... and I was in the same town...<eos> I would visit her.<eos> Well, I hope you're happy.
No more than a half an hour from your front door.<eos> Now, she would attend the Oaks.<eos> It's a great school.<eos> And visiting rights for the grandmother... but she was gonna get that anyway.<eos> Right?<eos> And on her 12th birthday, Frank, she can go back into court... - No.<eos> - ...and decide then... where she wants to live and with who.<eos> I don't understand this.<eos> I thought you were supposed to be on my team.<eos> Why are you bringing me this deal?
You like this deal?<eos> I love this deal.<eos> They think they're gonna lose.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They do.<eos> You think we're gonna lose.<eos> Yes.<eos> I do, Frank.<eos> I gotta go put my kids to bed.<eos> I'll do whatever you want me to do.
Teach her to say "irregardless."<eos> The only saving grace, I suppose, is she's better off than she was.<eos> Well...<eos> Goodbye, Frank.<eos> Hey... come on.<eos> I'm only 25 minutes away.<eos> Please don't leave me here.<eos> - Please.<eos> - No.<eos> Look, you're going to a brand new school, a better school.
I want my crummy school.<eos> - And you got Fred.<eos> - Please.<eos> And once a month you can come back.<eos> You can stay with me and Roberta.<eos> I want you and Roberta now!<eos> And in a few years, if you want... you can come back.<eos> You can live with me.<eos> I wanna stay with you.<eos> Frank, you promised me.

Frank, you promised me.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> - You promised me.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> Please, Frank.<eos> Why are you leaving me?<eos> Because the court said I had to.<eos> You know this.
- Hey, Mary. - No!<eos> Hey, Mary.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Sweetheart, you know what?<eos> No!<eos> There's no easy way to do this.<eos> Not gonna be as long as you think, honey.<eos> - Frank!<eos> - You're gonna see.
- I know it's hard.<eos> - Come back!<eos> - Mary!<eos> I know.<eos> No!<eos> Frank!<eos> Don't go!<eos> I need you!<eos> Fred needs you!<eos> You promised me!
A child that might still have a mother... if I had taken the time to notice that she needed me.<eos> And now, six and a half years later... I finally got her to the foster family, and you know what?<eos> It was great.<eos> She loved it.<eos> I thought it would be a nightmare... of abandonment and betrayal.<eos> But, turns out it was a huge success.<eos> I'm a fucking hero.<eos> - Frank...<eos> - No, Bonnie.<eos> I appreciate everything you've done.
- Kevin.<eos> Evelyn is in the guest house.<eos> Yeah, listen.<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> Frank, let me tell you, she was so helpful with the tutors.<eos> - Mary was so distant. - Hey!<eos> Look, we know what you're up against.<eos> Do you want your life back?<eos> Go back inside.<eos> What are you doing here?
Frank, let me tell you, she was so helpful with the tutors.<eos> - Mary was so distant. - Hey!<eos> Look, we know what you're up against.<eos> Do you want your life back?<eos> Go back inside.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Come on, Mary.<eos> We're goin' home.<eos> - No.<eos> - You're trespassing!
No!<eos> Let me go!<eos> No!<eos> - No!<eos> No!<eos> - Stop, Mary!<eos> - Stop. Stop.<eos> - No!<eos> - Come here.<eos> - You lied to me!
- Come here.<eos> - You lied to me!<eos> I know!<eos> - No! No!<eos> - Stop!<eos> Stop, stop!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You promised me.
Stop, stop!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You promised me.<eos> I know.<eos> You promised.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You said you wouldn't leave me.
It's okay.<eos> - I got him.<eos> He's home.<eos> - What?<eos> He's at the apartment right now.<eos> I got him.<eos> For real?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's home kicking around his ping pong ball.<eos> Why did you leave me there?
He's at the apartment right now.<eos> I got him.<eos> For real?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's home kicking around his ping pong ball.<eos> Why did you leave me there?<eos> Because I thought I was bad for you.<eos> And then it dawned on me.<eos> If Mary is this amazing... smart, sweet human being... then I must be doing something right.<eos> You're smiling.

Let's just say Diane didn't tell me, which is nonsense... it's a Millennium Problem.<eos> She would have shared it with the world.<eos> That's where your charade falls apart.<eos> If she had completed the proof, she would have published it.<eos> Diane instructed me very clearly.<eos> That I was only to publish it postmortem.<eos> She died six years ago.<eos> It wasn't her death she was talking about.<eos> I tried to talk her out of it.<eos> But you know how Diane could be when she made her mind up about something.

I can't hear you.<eos> Could you speak up, please?<eos> Hello?<eos> Evelyn Adler... for Seymore Shankland, please.<eos> And what I want you to notice, is that when you compute P of N... for N congruent to four mod five... the answer is a multiple of five.<eos> So, the first person to notice this was Srinivasa Ramanujan.<eos> In the beginning of the 20th century... he proved that it was the case for all... numbers congruent to four mod five.<eos> So, he proved that P of five N plus four... is congruent to zero mod seven... and that P of eleven N plus six is congruent to zero mod eleven.<eos> Good?<eos> You drive like an old lady.
I used to want to save the world.<eos> This beautiful place.<eos> But I knew so little then.<eos> It is a land of magic and wonder.<eos> Worth cherishing in every way.<eos> But the closer you get the more you see the great darkness shimmering within.
- She looks very good.<eos> - Very good.<eos> How is she?<eos> She's good.<eos> - Keep working.<eos> - I will.<eos> Niobi.<eos> Diana!<eos> Diana, I see you.<eos> Where are you going?
- I will.<eos> Niobi.<eos> Diana!<eos> Diana, I see you.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Slow down!<eos> Hello mother.<eos> How are you today?<eos> Let's get you back to school, before another tutor quits.<eos> But don't you think it's time to start my training?
But don't you think it's time to start my training?<eos> Antiope thinks I'm ready.<eos> Does she?<eos> I could begin showing her some things.<eos> She should at least be able to defend herself.<eos> From whom?<eos> In the event of an invasion.<eos> Isn't that why I have the greatest warrior in our history leading an entire army, General?<eos> I pray day will never come when she has to fight.<eos> But you know, a scorpion must sting...
- She is a child.<eos> The only child on the island. Please let her be so.<eos> But, mother...<eos> There will be no training.<eos> What if I promise to be careful?<eos> It's time to sleep.<eos> What if I didn't use a sword?<eos> Fighting does not make you a hero.<eos> Just the shield then, no sharp edges.<eos> Diana, you are the most precious thing in the world to me.

...One powerful enough to kill a god.<eos> With his dying breath, Zeus created this island... to hide us from the outside world Somewhere Ares could not find us.<eos> And all has been quiet ever since.<eos> We give thanks to the gods for giving us this paradise.<eos> And the God Killer?<eos> The God Killer?<eos> The weapon that is strong enough to kill a God.<eos> Can I see it?<eos> The gods gave us many gifts.<eos> One day, you'll know them all.
One day, you'll know them all.<eos> This great tower is where we keep them.<eos> The God Killer.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Who would be wield it?<eos> I pray it will never be called to arms.<eos> But only the fiercest among us even could.<eos> And that's not you, Diana.<eos> You see?<eos> You are safe and there is nothing you should concern yourself with.

Are you hurt?<eos> No, Mother, I'm fine.<eos> - I was just... - Training.<eos> Seems I'm not the revered queen I should be.<eos> Disobeyed, betrayed by my own sister...<eos> No, mother. It was me.<eos> I asked her...<eos> Take her to the palace.<eos> Off you go.<eos> You left me no choice, Hippolyta.

What had I done?<eos> I am sorry.<eos> Where did this fog come from?<eos> There...<eos> Go forward.<eos> There he is!<eos> The pilot!<eos> I can see him.<eos> Wow.<eos> You are a man.
The pilot!<eos> I can see him.<eos> Wow.<eos> You are a man.<eos> Yeah. I mean...<eos> Do I not look like one?<eos> Where are we?<eos> Temiscira.<eos> What?<eos> Who are you?
- No!<eos> - Anti­ope!<eos> No!<eos> - You.<eos> - No..<eos> No mother no.<eos> He fought at my side against the invaders.<eos> What man fights against his own people?<eos> These aren't my people.<eos> Then, why do you wear their colors?
No!<eos> - You.<eos> - No..<eos> No mother no.<eos> He fought at my side against the invaders.<eos> What man fights against his own people?<eos> These aren't my people.<eos> Then, why do you wear their colors?<eos> I can't tell you that.<eos> You need to tell us now!
Innocent people Women and children slaughtered.<eos> Their homes and thier villages looted burned.<eos> Weapons far deadlier than you can ever imagine.<eos> It's like nothing I've ever seen.<eos> It's like the world's gonna end.<eos> Should we let him go?<eos> And risk him bringing more men to our shores?<eos> We can not hold him forever, my queen.<eos> Mother, excuse me but after everything the man said, this must be Ares.<eos> What are you talking about, child?
Forgive me, Senator, but the man called it a war without end.<eos> Millions of people already dead.<eos> Like nothing he's ever seen.<eos> Only Ares could do such a thing.<eos> We can not simply let him go. We must go with him.<eos> I will not deploy our army and leave them scare defences to go and fight their war.<eos> It's not their war.<eos> Zeus created man to be just, and wise, strong and passionate...<eos> That was a story, Diana!<eos> This much, you do not understand?

And stopping the God of war is our fore ordinance.<eos> As Amazons this is our duty.<eos> But you're not an Amazon like the rest of us.

A watch?<eos> Yeah, it's a watch.<eos> Tells time.<eos> My father gave it to me.<eos> Went through hell 'n back with him.<eos> Now it's for me and, good thing it's still ticking..<eos> What for?<eos> Because it tells time.<eos> When to eat, sleep, wake up, work...<eos> You let this little thing tell you what to do?
Because it tells time.<eos> When to eat, sleep, wake up, work...<eos> You let this little thing tell you what to do?<eos> Yeah...<eos> Can I ask you some questions?<eos> -Where are we?<eos> -Temiscira.<eos> No, I got that before, but I mean.. Where are we? What is this place?<eos> Why does the water do that?<eos> How come you don't know what a watch is?

What is this place?<eos> Why does the water do that?<eos> How come you don't know what a watch is?<eos> How can you speak English so well?<eos> We speak hundreds of languages.<eos> We are the bridge to a greater understanding between all men.<eos> Right.<eos> I didn't get a chance to say this earlier, but thank you for dragging me out of the water.<eos> Thank you for what you did on the beach.

Or anyone.<eos> In Amazon..<eos> The Amazons.<eos> The Amazons?<eos> It is our sacred duty to defend the world.<eos> And I wish to go..<eos> But my mother will not allow it.<eos> Well... I can't say I blame her.<eos> The way this war's going I don't wanna let anyone I care about near.<eos> Then why do you want to go back?

Of course I know how to sail.<eos> Why wouldn't I know how to sail?<eos> It's just... It's been a while.<eos> I am going, mother.<eos> I cannot stand by while innocent lives are lost.<eos> If no one else will defend the world from Ares, then I must.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I know.<eos> Or at least I know I can not stop you.<eos> There is so much... So much you do not understand.

They do not deserve you.<eos> You've been my greatest love.<eos> Today you are my greatest sorrow.<eos> Should you have told her?<eos> The more she knows, the sooner he will find her.<eos> How long until we reach the war?<eos> The war, which part?<eos> The Western Front in France is 400 miles long, from the Alps to the North Sea.<eos> Where the fighting is the most intense then.<eos> If you take me there, I'm sure I'll find Ares.
With this.<eos> And once I do the war will end.<eos> I appreciate your spirit but this war is...<eos> And there's not a whole lot you and I can do about that.<eos> I mean, we can get back to London and try to look for men who can.<eos> I'm the man who can!<eos> Once I find and destroy Ares the German armies will be freed from his influence they will good men again and the world will be better.<eos> Great.<eos> You will see.<eos> What are you doing?

Not polite to assume, you know?<eos> "Marriage"?<eos> Marriage! You don't have...<eos> You go before a judge and you swear to love, honor and cherish each other Until death do you apart.<eos> And do they..<eos> love each other till death?<eos> Not very often, no.<eos> Then why do they do it?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> So you cannot sleep with me unless I marry you..
So you cannot sleep with me unless I marry you..<eos> I sleep with you if you want. I'll sleep right there.<eos> There is plenty of room.<eos> - Then fine, if you don't mind...<eos> - No, it's up to you.<eos> - I'm just fine.<eos> - Coming to sleep with you.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, where I come from, I'm not considered average.<eos> You know, um.. being a spy... you must show a certain amount of vigor.

Why not?<eos> They came to the conclusion that man are essential for procreation but when it comes to pleasure Unnecessary.<eos> No.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> How long until we're operational?<eos> Two days, sir.<eos> We'll have it up tonight, Captain.<eos> Sir, the men have had no food, no sleep.<eos> Do you think I have had a neat food or rest, captain?

Not enough.<eos> It is over, General.<eos> Germany is giving up.<eos> Von Hindenburg has recommended the Kaiser sign the armistice.<eos> We have run out of time.<eos> As soon as the Kaiser sees the newest weapon he will not sign the armistice.<eos> But without my notebook...<eos> We will get your book!<eos> It is you that I believe in, not it.<eos> I know what you can and will succeed...
Probably because they're together.<eos> No... No..<eos> We're not together, I mean, in that way.<eos> This way.<eos> To the war!<eos> Well, technically, the war is that way. But we gotta get this way first.<eos> And where are we going?<eos> We gotta get this notebook to my superiors.<eos> Hey! Hey..!<eos> No. I let you go. You take me to Ares.
No. I let you go. You take me to Ares.<eos> -We made a deal, Steve Trevor.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> And a deal is a promise.<eos> You know promises unbreakable.<eos> Oh, damn it, alright.<eos> Come with me first to deliver this and then we'll give you a ticket to the war.<eos> Deal?<eos> -Let's go. -Diana...<eos> What are you doing?

Let's go...<eos> Let's go buy some clothes.<eos> What do these women wear into battle?<eos> They don't...<eos> A baby!<eos> No, no.. No babies.<eos> One's not made out of clay.<eos> Come on.<eos> Diana! Please.<eos> Thank God! You're not dead!

Lovely.<eos> It's itching. It's choking me.<eos> Can they blame it?<eos> Etta.<eos> Where is she?<eos> She's trying on upto number 226.<eos> May I?<eos> Really?<eos> Specs?<eos> Unless it's the most beautiful woman you've ever seen?
Yep, that's not gonna work.<eos> Please put the sword down, Diana.<eos> Diana!<eos> Let me try by myself.<eos> After you, sir.<eos> Etta...<eos> Why don't I meet you back at the office?<eos> And meanwhile, I'll take this for safekeeping.<eos> Oh no, I don't think so.<eos> You gotta put the sword down, Diana. Please.
Captain Trevor.<eos> I believe you have something that is the property of Gen. Ludendorff.<eos> Ah, it's the bad guy convention.<eos> Give us Dr Maru's note book.<eos> Where I put that thing?<eos> Stand back!<eos> Or maybe not.<eos> Tough luck.<eos> Is there anything else you wanna show me?<eos> Where do you think you're going?
...and restore world peace... is to negotiate an armistice.<eos> There's a woman.<eos> What is she doing here?<eos> Get her out..<eos> Ger her out..<eos> Sorry.<eos> Blind sister, she got lost on the way to her bathroom..<eos> I think it's right where I guess.<eos> Our only aim at this time must be to achieve peace at any cost!<eos> Why you been not hearing speech?

Diana... Diana!<eos> All of you should be ashamed!<eos> Please slow down!<eos> Is that your leader?<eos> How could he say that?<eos> Believe that?<eos> And.. and you!<eos> - Was your duty to simply give them a book?<eos> -No!<eos> You didn't stand your ground. You didn't fight.

You didn't fight.<eos> Because there was no chance of changing anything.<eos> This is Ares and he's not going to allow negotiation, ...nor a surrender!<eos> The millions of people you talked about, they will die.

So my uncle, the Prince, and I...<eos> Which prince is that?<eos> I decided to extend your profanity...<eos> But seriously, which prince?<eos> Hey, Sultan, Angoora, Next Kashmir Care to talk for a minute?<eos> Gentlemen, excuse me one second.<eos> - A bar...<eos> Well, a pub.<eos> - You hypocrite.<eos> I've been racing those peacock all night, and you've...
Gentlemen, excuse me one second.<eos> - A bar...<eos> Well, a pub.<eos> - You hypocrite.<eos> I've been racing those peacock all night, and you've...<eos> Oh my goodness, gracious.<eos> That's a work of art.<eos> Sameer, Diana.<eos> Diana, Sameer!<eos> Hi, Diana. You can call me Sammy please.
I've been racing those peacock all night, and you've...<eos> Oh my goodness, gracious.<eos> That's a work of art.<eos> Sameer, Diana.<eos> Diana, Sameer!<eos> Hi, Diana. You can call me Sammy please.<eos> "Sammy".<eos> Oh Sameer, I wouldn't... do that if I were you.<eos> Sameer is a top undercover man.<eos> He can talk the skin off a cabbage many ways as you can.

Good to see you.<eos> So what were you fighting about?<eos> I mistook his glass for mine.<eos> That happens.<eos> This man is no fighter.<eos> Charlie is an expert marksman.<eos> Means he shoots people.<eos> From very far away.<eos> You never know what hit 'em.<eos> So, how do you know who you kill if you can't see their face?

In that case, to allay suspicion our charming Etta could run the mission from my office.<eos> "Run"...<eos> Also. ...There is enough here for a few days.<eos> Thank you sir.<eos> You're very welcome.<eos> Take great care all of you and good luck.<eos> Fresh ice-cream.<eos> Hello miss, would you like to buy an ice cream?<eos> - Me?<eos> - You hungry?
Fresh ice-cream.<eos> Hello miss, would you like to buy an ice cream?<eos> - Me?<eos> - You hungry?<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Eight pence please, sir.<eos> There you go, keep the change.<eos> Thank you very much sir.<eos> - What you doing?
Ludendorff, enough!<eos> 24 hours from now this war will end.<eos> It is over.<eos> It's over for you.<eos> It is over for all of you..<eos> But the mask won't help.<eos> They don't know that.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Time to stage a demonstration for the Kaiser!<eos> You're late.

How are you?<eos> - Good to see you pal.<eos> - Big mike.<eos> - Good to see you.<eos> - Oh yes!<eos> Good to see you my friend.<eos> Yaa beauty!<eos> Who is this?<eos> And I am Diana.<eos> Where did you find her?
And guns!<eos> Well... May we get what we want?<eos> May we get what we need.<eos> But may we never get what we deserve.<eos> Bang!<eos> Strange thunder.<eos> German 77's.<eos> Guns, big ones.<eos> It's the front out there.<eos> - The evening hay. - So, who do you fight for in this war?

The last war took everything from my people.<eos> We have nothing left.<eos> At least here I'm free.<eos> Who took that from your people?<eos> His people.<eos> Don't go...<eos> Don't go there.<eos> Do not go!<eos> Don't go in there.<eos> You are safe.

Don't worry about Charlie. He doesn't mean any, alright?<eos> The animals, why are they hurting them?<eos> Because they need to move quick!<eos> - Like us!<eos> - But this is not the way.<eos> I could help them.<eos> There is no time. Come on, woman!<eos> Mama!<eos> That man... he's wounded.<eos> There is nothing you can do about it, Diana.
- Like us!<eos> - But this is not the way.<eos> I could help them.<eos> There is no time. Come on, woman!<eos> Mama!<eos> That man... he's wounded.<eos> There is nothing you can do about it, Diana.<eos> We must keep moving.<eos> What is this?<eos> You wanted me to take you to war.
Next safe crossing is at least a day away.<eos> - What are we waiting for?<eos> - We can not leave without helping them.<eos> These people are dying.<eos> Nothing to eat and in the village...<eos> - enslaved it there!<eos> - I understand that.<eos> Women and children!<eos> We need to make our next position by sunset.<eos> How can you say that?
Women and children!<eos> We need to make our next position by sunset.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> What is the matter with you?<eos> This is No Man's Land! Diana!<eos> Means no man can cross it, alright?<eos> This battalion has been here for nearly a year and they barely gained an inch.<eos> Alright?<eos> Because on the other side, there are a bunch of Germans ...pointing machine guns at every square inch of this place.<eos> This is not something you can cross. This is not possible.
- ... Lift hard!<eos> - All right.<eos> Diana! Shield!<eos> Go!<eos> Stay very very still, for me my friends.<eos> Please. It's so important.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> This has been such an honor for me taking you photograph.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> For obvious talk of shooting you cannot shoot.
This has been such an honor for me taking you photograph.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> For obvious talk of shooting you cannot shoot.<eos> Not everyone gets to be where they want to be all the time.<eos> Me, I'm an actor.<eos> I love acting.<eos> I didn't want to be a soldier.<eos> But I'm the wrong color.<eos> Everyone's fighting their own battle, Diana.<eos> Truth is you're fighting yours.
It's too much.<eos> I wish you...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hi..<eos> I'm on the phone...<eos> Ah, it's "Veld", V-E-L-D.<eos> It's a tiny village.<eos> It may not even be on the map.<eos> I found it!<eos> Did you find Ludendorff's operation?
Hold on one second, sir.<eos> We shouldn't be bothered about setting the peace agreement.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Ares would never let...<eos> What?<eos> What is that?<eos> Of course, it makes complete sense.<eos> Ares developed a weapon, the worst ever devised.<eos> - Ares?<eos> You mean Ludendorff.
- Sir...<eos> How likely is he to respect my wishes?<eos> Not very like convinced.<eos> Sammy, Sammy, no, no.<eos> Sammy, I have to work.<eos> I gotta rustle up with a German uniform I took to plough the course tomorrow.<eos> That's easy, boss.<eos> Come on.<eos> There's nothing we can do till tomorrow.<eos> You said yourself, Steve.

There's nothing we can do till tomorrow.<eos> You said yourself, Steve.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You did this.<eos> We did.<eos> Do you have dancing on Paradise Island?<eos> Oh, dancing, yeah of course.<eos> These people are just... swaying.<eos> Okay, if you're gonna be fighting the God of war I might as well teach you how to dance, you poor thing.
We did.<eos> Do you have dancing on Paradise Island?<eos> Oh, dancing, yeah of course.<eos> These people are just... swaying.<eos> Okay, if you're gonna be fighting the God of war I might as well teach you how to dance, you poor thing.<eos> Alright, probably without the gun.<eos> If you would...<eos> Well...<eos> If I'm going to the Gala, I'll need to know how to dance.<eos> - You aren't going to the Gala.

I would argue with this, they don't know how to dance.<eos> Be polite. Be polite.<eos> All right. Give me your hand.<eos> Like so.<eos> And I'll put my arm around you like so.<eos> And we just..<eos> What do you call it?<eos> Sway?<eos> We'll just sway.<eos> You're awfully close.
And they love to wake up read the paper and go to work.<eos> They get married.<eos> Makes some babies and grow old together.<eos> I guess.<eos> What is that like?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> The villagers gave them to us.<eos> - A gracious gift.<eos> - And they call us heroes.<eos> You are.

No, Charlie.<eos> Who will sing for us?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh no, please.<eos> Sing?<eos> You asked for it.<eos> The reeds are green.<eos> The reeds are green.<eos> The sweetest hours I could live.<eos> You must think I was born yesterday.
I know it sounds crazy, but it's true.<eos> Every word.<eos> Wait...wait.<eos> There is a whole island of women like her?<eos> And not a single man among them?<eos> How do we get there?<eos> And she thinks.. ...that Ludendorff is Ares, the god of war?<eos> And only by killing him will the war end.<eos> Don't be daft.<eos> You saw what happened out there.
And she thinks.. ...that Ludendorff is Ares, the god of war?<eos> And only by killing him will the war end.<eos> Don't be daft.<eos> You saw what happened out there.<eos> The way she dropped that machine gun next.<eos> The way she took out the tower?<eos> May be it's true.<eos> I think it's true.<eos> I believe it's true.<eos> Steven son, you don't really believe those rubbish thing?
May be it's true.<eos> I think it's true.<eos> I believe it's true.<eos> Steven son, you don't really believe those rubbish thing?<eos> Diana, Diana, hide in..<eos> How the hell do we get into that?<eos> I see only a couple of guards in the door to distract.<eos> Yeah, it won't look suspicious when I wanna come sauntering out of the woods.<eos> I could get in.<eos> You are not going in there, it's too dangerous.

Your invitation, please.<eos> Thank you sir.<eos> The Colonel and I wish many blessings and all my love to fall up in your head.<eos> Your head must be empty. Find the invitation, you idiot.<eos> I am sorry.<eos> I am so sorry, I must apologize a thousand times, my master.<eos> I made the most horrible, the most unforgivable mistake.<eos> - I lost the Colonel's invitation.<eos> - What?<eos> You saying we come all the way through the mud and rain...

Move your car!<eos> What are you supposed to be?<eos> What are you doing?
But I hear peace would be so close.<eos> Peace?<eos> It's only an armistice and an endless war.<eos> Thucydides.<eos> You know your ancient Greeks?<eos> They understood that war was a god. A god who requires human sacrifices.<eos> And in exchange war gives man purpose meaning, a chance to rise above his petty, mortal little self and be courageous Noble!<eos> Only one of the many gods believed in that.<eos> And he was wrong.<eos> You know nothing of the gods.

Diana...<eos> The gas.<eos> The villagers!<eos> What they cheering for?<eos> Diana!<eos> What did they fire?<eos> The gas.<eos> - It was Ludendorff.<eos> - I saw him, he was in the tower.<eos> Wherever he goes you follow.

Diana!<eos> That smoke it's the chief!<eos> He followed Ludendorff.<eos> Follow the smoke!<eos> Hey! Diana, Over there!<eos> Come on. Let's go!<eos> Ooh, what a surprise.<eos> Strange.<eos> Unfortunately, I have another matter to attend to.<eos> What are you?

They can now stop fighting now.<eos> Why are they still fighting?<eos> That's because maybe it's them!<eos> Maybe...<eos> Maybe people aren't always good.<eos> Ares or no Ares Maybe it's just, who they are.<eos> - Diana...<eos> - No.<eos> Diana, we can talk about this later.<eos> - I need you to come with me.
Diana, people...<eos> I...<eos> She was right.<eos> My mother was right.<eos> She said the world of men do not deserve you.<eos> They don't deserve our help, Steve.<eos> - It's not about deserve!<eos> - They do not deserve our help.<eos> Maybe we don't!<eos> But it's not about that. It's about what you believe.

It's about what you believe.<eos> You don't think I get it, after what I've seen out there?<eos> You don't think I wish I could tell you that I was one bad guy to blame?<eos> It's not!<eos> We are all to blame.<eos> I am not.<eos> But maybe I am!<eos> Please.<eos> If you believe it. This war should stop if you want to stop it help me stop it right now.
Please.<eos> If you believe it. This war should stop if you want to stop it help me stop it right now.<eos> Because... If you don't, they will kill thousands more. Please, please come with me.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Hey!<eos> - Where is Diana?<eos> - We are on our own.<eos> - What?<eos> - What do you see, Charlie?
- We are on our own.<eos> - What?<eos> - What do you see, Charlie?<eos> Seems like a bunch of gas pumps but I can't see where they're taking them.<eos> How are we gonna get in there?<eos> I have got an idea. Come on guys.<eos> Come on!<eos> Who's there?<eos> Sir Patrick.<eos> You were right, Diana.
How are we gonna get in there?<eos> I have got an idea. Come on guys.<eos> Come on!<eos> Who's there?<eos> Sir Patrick.<eos> You were right, Diana.<eos> They don't deserve our help.<eos> They only deserve destruction.<eos> You...<eos> You are him.
Come on!<eos> Who's there?<eos> Sir Patrick.<eos> You were right, Diana.<eos> They don't deserve our help.<eos> They only deserve destruction.<eos> You...<eos> You are him.<eos> I am.<eos> But I'm not what you thought I was.
They only deserve destruction.<eos> You...<eos> You are him.<eos> I am.<eos> But I'm not what you thought I was.<eos> What is that?<eos> Future.<eos> I'm not your enemy, Diana.<eos> I'm the only one who truly knows you.<eos> And who truly knows them, as you now do.
And who truly knows them, as you now do.<eos> They always been and always will be weak, cruel, selfish and capable of the greatest horrors.<eos> All I ever wanted was for the Gods to see how evil my father's creation was.<eos> But they refused.<eos> I am Diana of Temiscira...<eos> So I destroyed them.<eos> daughter of Hippolyta... and I am here to complete her...<eos> The God Killer...<eos> My dear Child.. ...that's not the God Killer.<eos> You are.
I am Diana of Temiscira...<eos> So I destroyed them.<eos> daughter of Hippolyta... and I am here to complete her...<eos> The God Killer...<eos> My dear Child.. ...that's not the God Killer.<eos> You are.<eos> Only a God can kill another God.<eos> Zeus left the child he had with the queen of the Amazon.<eos> ...As a weapon to use against me.<eos> No. You liar.
Mankind Stole this world from us.<eos> They ruined it, day by day.<eos> And I, the only one wise enough to see it was left too weak to stop them.<eos> All these years I have struggled alone whispering into their ears.<eos> Ideas, inspiration for formulas weapons but I don't make them use them.<eos> They start these wars on their own.<eos> All I do is orchestrate an armistice I know they cannot keep in the hope they will destroy themselves.<eos> But it has never been enough.<eos> Until you.<eos> When you first arrived I was going to crush you.

What are we gonna do?<eos> There is not much we can do if that's who I think it is.<eos> But we can stop that plane.<eos> If we could get on the radio we can ask flying corp to shoot her down.<eos> No. If it crashes, it will wipe everyone out for 50 square miles.<eos> We gotta ground it!<eos> Bad news. It's on a timer.<eos> If we ground it here, it's the same thing.<eos> Is it flammable, Chief?<eos> Yes, you said it's hydrogen. It's flammable.
- No, Steve!<eos> - Hey, Steve!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on! This way!<eos> Steve!<eos> - Come on, Steve.<eos> - Ahead!<eos> Go!<eos> Steve!<eos> Let's see what kind of god you really are.
- Hey, Steve!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on! This way!<eos> Steve!<eos> - Come on, Steve.<eos> - Ahead!<eos> Go!<eos> Steve!<eos> Let's see what kind of god you really are.<eos> You will help me destroy them, Diana.
Let's see what kind of god you really are.<eos> You will help me destroy them, Diana.<eos> Or you will die.<eos> Come on!<eos> Move, move, let's go!<eos> Go. Go. Go.<eos> - Now!<eos> - Go!<eos> Run!<eos> Is that all you have to offer?
You will help me destroy them, Diana.<eos> Or you will die.<eos> Come on!<eos> Move, move, let's go!<eos> Go. Go. Go.<eos> - Now!<eos> - Go!<eos> Run!<eos> Is that all you have to offer?<eos> It is futile to imagine you can win.
Anything left?<eos> I got nothing.<eos> - Anything!<eos> - No!<eos> Steve.<eos> Steve.<eos> No!<eos> Aye, Diana!<eos> Take them all!<eos> Finally you see.
Look at this world.<eos> Mankind did this, not me.<eos> They are ugly filled with hatred weak Just like your captain Trevor.<eos> Gone and left you nothing. And for what?<eos> Pathetic!<eos> They deserved to burn!<eos> Look at her and tell me I'm wrong.<eos> She is the perfect example of these humans and unworthy of your sympathy in every way.<eos> Destroy her, Diana.<eos> You know that she deserves.

We have to go.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Steve Whatever it is, I can do it.<eos> No.. No..<eos> - Let me do it.<eos> - No.<eos> It has to be me.<eos> It has to be me.<eos> I could save today.<eos> You can save the world.
No.. No..<eos> - Let me do it.<eos> - No.<eos> It has to be me.<eos> It has to be me.<eos> I could save today.<eos> You can save the world.<eos> I wish we had more time.<eos> What?<eos> What are you saying?

I wish we had more time.<eos> What?<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I love you!<eos> You are wrong about them.<eos> They are everything you say but so much more.<eos> Lies!<eos> They do not deserve your protection!<eos> It's not about deserving.<eos> It's about what you believe.
And if you start the enclosures tomorrow morning, we should be one day ahead of schedule.<eos> So go home.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, your family's arriving today, right?<eos> Yeah, but they're not flying in until later in the night.<eos> So go on, go home.<eos> Get everything ready for them, it's a big day.<eos> I have everything ready for them.<eos> I mean, I have the whole house decked out.<eos> Matt, you wouldn't believe it. Welcome signs, everything.

Could you just have a seat in here, please?<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> Can I get you any water, anything to drink?<eos> No, no, thank you.<eos> Thank you. Did the plane arrive early?<eos> I mean, are they here already?<eos> I don't have all the information so I don't want to tell you anything that might not be true.<eos> Somebody will be right in to speak with you.<eos> Okay.<eos> What do you mean?

You'll have access to medical and psychological treatments and social services.<eos> That's also where you'll be updated on any news that comes in.<eos> If you'd rather be alone, you can do that there, too.<eos> No.<eos> I would recommend that you go to the family support center tomorrow, when you're feeling stronger.<eos> You also have my email, cell phone and my department's phone number.<eos> Please don't hesitate to call me.<eos> - Yes. - Very well.<eos> Wait, wait, wait...<eos> - Did you talk to the plumber?
- You know, when I was a kid, I had this little stuffed bear, his name was Ishmael.<eos> - Ishmael?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's a weird name for a bear.<eos> And when we took trips I always had to take him with me or I wouldn't be able to sleep.<eos> This went on 'til much, much later.<eos> How much later?<eos> 'Til you were 24? 'Til you met me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You always say that you can't sleep without me.
I don't know.<eos> You always say that you can't sleep without me.<eos> Yeah, that's true.<eos> I just don't know what to think.<eos> - What?<eos> - Is that all I am to you?<eos> Some lousy substitute for Ishmael?<eos> Hey, being Ishmael's substitute is a big honor.<eos> I'd do anything for Ishmael.<eos> Did you have sex with Ishmael?

Yeah?<eos> I'll remember you while I'm in the bathroom, if that's what you want.
How many people were on those planes?<eos> We don't know, Jake.<eos> Oh, my God, how many people are dead?<eos> Jake, listen to me.<eos> Jake, Jake listen to me.<eos> We don't know what happened.<eos> No one's accusing you of anything.<eos> - I didn't do anything!<eos> - We understand, Jake.<eos> No one is saying you did anything.
- I didn't do anything!<eos> - We understand, Jake.<eos> No one is saying you did anything.<eos> We're trying to find out what happened.<eos> We need you to keep it together because we gotta figure this out.<eos> Do you hear me, Jake?<eos> No one's accusing you of anything.<eos> We're just doing an investigation...<eos> - Listen to me, Jake.<eos> It's very important you keep it together, alright?

Nadiya.<eos> Sweetie.<eos> You know you're not allowed to be out here all alone.<eos> - Where's your dad?<eos> - I don't know,<eos> I haven't seen him since this morning.<eos> Come on, is he inside?<eos> Hey, man, get up!<eos> Come on, man, don't make me call the cops again, let's go.<eos> I'm sorry, man, but every time you spend the night out here, I get in trouble.

Smell.<eos> Mm... green chilies, vinegar, garlic, thyme.<eos> I love thyme.<eos> First,therewas only one air traffic controller inthecontrolroom managingtheairspace.<eos> Jake!<eos> I thought we agreed, no news.<eos> - Good morning, mommy.<eos> - Good morning, Christina.<eos> - So early, huh?<eos> - Are you hungry?

Mr. Melnyk?<eos> Mr. Melnyk?<eos> My name is Tessa Corbett, I'm a journalist.<eos> I know you're in there.<eos> I don't want to bother you, I just came 'cause I wanted to share some of my articles with you.<eos> I'm writing a book about the accident and I'd like to ask you a few questions.<eos> You'll see from my articles that I'm trying to be faithful and respectful to the facts.<eos> Take a look if you get a chance.<eos> I'll come back and see what you think.<eos> Roman. You haven't answered my calls for days, I thought I'd stop by.

Oh, I'm sorry, but my house isn't presentable right now.<eos> You haven't seen mine.<eos> Hey, my wife made meatballs and she insisted that I bring you some.<eos> She makes them with mushrooms, they're awesome.<eos> - So, how is work?<eos> - Same old.<eos> Everything goes a little more slowly without you there.<eos> Hey, I don't mean anything by that.<eos> You come back whenever you're ready.<eos> So, how are you?
So, I got, I'm sorry, I got to get going.<eos> Of course, I'll leave you to it.<eos> You take care, Roman.<eos> Of course I love you, Jake.<eos> I think this is best for Samuel and for us, and I really hope it's best for you, too.<eos> - Where is Samuel right now?<eos> - He's at my sister's, remember?<eos> What, I can't even say goodbye to him?<eos> Honey, you don't have to say goodbye.<eos> You can see him whenever you want.

Let me get some of your information I'll get you guys started.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Great.<eos> Well, come on, time for a break.<eos> No, I'd like to finish this side today.<eos> I already opened them, so.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Oh... this week's pay.<eos> Not until I'm finished.<eos> - You're doing a great job.
I'm glad you're here.<eos> Okay, let me get your stuff.<eos> We were rehearsing his lines the whole way here.<eos> Yeah, well, he did a good job.<eos> Hey, you guys are a lot earlier than I thought.<eos> Yeah, we made great time.<eos> We had a speed demon in the passenger seat.<eos> I'm just finishing up dinner, you guys make yourselves at home.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So who did you tell him Pat Dealbert was?

- Okay.<eos> - Okay, brush some teeth.<eos> Yes?<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Look at this photo.<eos> This is my family!<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You can't be showing up here like this you hear me? - Look at it!<eos> - I see it, but my family's here, okay?<eos> - You killed them!

Don't be afraid.<eos> Don't be afraid, Nadiya.<eos> No.<eos> Hedidnotknow thatthenewlife would not be given to him for nothing, that he would have to pay dearly for it, that it would cost him great strife and great suffering. But that, that is the beginning of a new story.<eos> The story of the renewal of a man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing from one world into another.<eos> Roman, let's go.<eos> Sotheyagreed toreviewthesentence and apply the extenuating circumstances we presented.<eos> And to be honest, Roman, ah,<eos> I didn't expect them to reduce the sentence so drastically.<eos> It's been ten years and you could get parole in four months.
The safest place on earth.<eos> In Fortitude, you have to be able to provide for yourself.<eos> Everyone has got a job, so there is no crime.<eos> Everybody is always happy.<eos> While you are here, you will need your own rifle and a hat.<eos> Something groovy with ear flaps.<eos> I am required to ask you if you feel safe in Fortitude?<eos> Hmm mmm. Are you seeing anybody?<eos> Is that an official question?<eos> Where did you get this?
Where did you get this?<eos> I found a carcass.<eos> There is an entire carcass?<eos> What is it worth?<eos> It is priceless.<eos> Hello?<eos> ! Hello?<eos> !<eos> We have a very serious problem here.<eos> Did you see Charlie before he died?
What is it worth?<eos> It is priceless.<eos> Hello?<eos> ! Hello?<eos> !<eos> We have a very serious problem here.<eos> Did you see Charlie before he died?<eos> He found something precious.<eos> Is this what got him killed?<eos> I want you to take this to your labratory.
He found something precious.<eos> Is this what got him killed?<eos> I want you to take this to your labratory.<eos> Run tests on it.<eos> DCI Morton can provide invaluable analytical skills.<eos> We have skills.<eos> You know, nothing buried in permafrost ever decays.<eos> This place is a forensic treasure house.<eos> It's not that I can't forgive you...<eos> It's that you are not my man anymore.
No.<eos> What is causing this?<eos> Prehistoric frozen wasp thaws.<eos> Wasp injects eggs into human blood stream.<eos> The host is compelled to find a victim.<eos> Don't open the door.<eos> We can't let these things out.<eos> We will have to kill them all.<eos> Everyone in Fortitude could be infected.<eos> I need you to tell me where the mammoth can be found.
Alexei?<eos> Morning, Governor Odegard.<eos> Hey, Bianca.<eos> "The centre cannot hold. Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world."<eos> Exam time.<eos> English lit.<eos> Tuesday morning.<eos> - Good luck.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> What are you doing?
- Good luck.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Please, just calm down.<eos> I just, I want to see your bag.<eos> Get off me.<eos> I just want to see in your bag.<eos> No.<eos> Get off me.<eos> I saw you putting carrots in your bag.
I just, I want to see your bag.<eos> Get off me.<eos> I just want to see in your bag.<eos> No.<eos> Get off me.<eos> I saw you putting carrots in your bag.<eos> Okay, just let me see.<eos> - No, get off me.<eos> - You will wait!<eos> You come with me!
I'll called the police!<eos> Let her go!<eos> I'll bury this in your fucking skull!<eos> Put the axe down now, Rune!<eos> That's enough of all this...<eos> Drop the axe and lie face down on the floor, or I'll shoot you!<eos> I don't think I want this after all, thank you, Hong.<eos> So shoot me! Huh!<eos> Dad hears about this...<eos> you're for it, Rune!
- What's he talking a...<eos> - Mister Lennox?<eos> Hey, Bianca.<eos> I did it.<eos> Everything you need.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Lot more fun than the late poems of WB Yeats.<eos> Ahahah, way to go, girl.<eos> Oh, Bianca...<eos> You don't know what this means...
Give me the detonator.<eos> There is no going back.<eos> Three hundred thousand tons of snow and ice.<eos> Buried forever, Vincent.<eos> Crushed and lost forever.<eos> That's right.<eos> Okay then.<eos> Do it.<eos> Hey. Vince.<eos> You're back.
Believe me, they don't want to run Fortitude at all.<eos> I've already co-signed these.<eos> You need to sign them.<eos> Dear God, Hildur.<eos> Cut your losses.<eos> And get out of here.<eos> There's a vacant governorship. In Trondheim.<eos> They have a cheese festival.<eos> Eric could be deputy.<eos> Last night. Did you look out of your window, around midnight?
Until for one brief whisper.<eos> I glimpsed peace.<eos> He showed me...<eos> That's the bar closed now.<eos> Tonight, he's back on earth.<eos> Cannibals and demons.<eos> Idiot.<eos> Man's head is full of fairytales.<eos> Ingrid!<eos> What the hell are you doing...?
Has Lars been drinking?<eos> Everybody's been drinking.<eos> There.<eos> Help me here.<eos> Who is it?<eos> Oh, my, Petra...<eos> Let's turn him around.<eos> His head is gone.<eos> Freya!<eos> Where are you!
- Michael...<eos> - Baddest bastards in the sea.<eos> Oh cut it out, you lunatic.<eos> Not one of them as bad as me...<eos> Oh, put me down before you hurt your stupid back.<eos> Okay.<eos> So the snow plough hit him.<eos> The snow plough hit him.<eos> And the blade of the snow plough sliced off the head.<eos> You think?
A murder scene.<eos> Who is he?<eos> There is no I.D.<eos> None of us recognise him.<eos> I don't recognise him either.<eos> So... you have to get back up there now.<eos> Secure the scene.<eos> Fingertip search.<eos> Photographs.<eos> Petra, you'll be the senior investigating officer.
So... you have to get back up there now.<eos> Secure the scene.<eos> Fingertip search.<eos> Photographs.<eos> Petra, you'll be the senior investigating officer.<eos> What about Eric?<eos> Unfortunately, Eric is not here.<eos> He is still looking for Dan's body.<eos> Okay.<eos> Like some kind of puppy, that you tolerated or... or... found amusing... or cute or... loyal or obedient or...

- Don't what?<eos> Say stuff like that.<eos> I know you don't.<eos> - To anyone.<eos> I never have.<eos> - Said what?<eos> That I...<eos> I just don't find it easy...<eos> So say it then.<eos> Because how the fuck is any poor fucker ever supposed to know how you feel about them.
- Said what?<eos> That I...<eos> I just don't find it easy...<eos> So say it then.<eos> Because how the fuck is any poor fucker ever supposed to know how you feel about them.<eos> If you feel about them.<eos> They could trust their instincts.<eos> My instincts!<eos> My instincts told me that you wanted Jason.<eos> You wanted a big alpha sex bloke.
My instincts!<eos> My instincts told me that you wanted Jason.<eos> You wanted a big alpha sex bloke.<eos> A sex bloke?<eos> Yeah!<eos> A strong man.<eos> Not a fucking puppy.<eos> Jason killed himself.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> You nearly died too.

Not any more, cos I, I need to go, I need to leave this place.<eos> I don't think I'm ever going to get better.<eos> I need to find my passport and then pack.<eos> Will you, err...<eos> Come and see me in London.<eos> Come on.<eos> Blood!<eos> Thank you, Tomak.<eos> You drinking alone?<eos> Not if you join me.
Freya.<eos> Baby.<eos> Come on, baby, come on.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - I'm okay. Michael.<eos> I'm okay...<eos> Dear Christ. If I hadn't seen that light on the ground.<eos> If I hadn't seen the light outside my car window.<eos> It's okay. Baby.<eos> How long were... you...
Baby.<eos> Come on, baby, come on.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - I'm okay. Michael.<eos> I'm okay...<eos> Dear Christ. If I hadn't seen that light on the ground.<eos> If I hadn't seen the light outside my car window.<eos> It's okay. Baby.<eos> How long were... you...<eos> how long were you...?
My legs went, I think.<eos> - I'm calling the doctor.<eos> - No.<eos> Yes, Freya, Frey, this is too soon.<eos> It's too soon.<eos> This shouldn't be...<eos> They said it would be six months... six months to a year... before...<eos> This shouldn't be.<eos> No.<eos> You can't.

You can't.<eos> You know you can't.<eos> I'm not leaving my home and that's what the doctor will do.<eos> Exile.<eos> I can't stay on the Island if they know I'm this sick.<eos> No.<eos> No. Michael.<eos> Just cuddle me.<eos> Make me warm.<eos> You can't call him.
Vincent has wasps in his head.<eos> Well.<eos> They nearly killed him.<eos> Is Eric the sheriff now?<eos> Do you think Eric would make a good sheriff?<eos> 'A good sheriff or a baaad sheriff'.<eos> Dan's dead.<eos> I know that.<eos> I've known that for a while.<eos> You don't disappear in the arctic and then show up weeks later with stubble and a story.
- What happened...<eos> You alright?<eos> Yeah.<eos> My wrist turned... that's all.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Take me with you.<eos> - What? - Dad. You're short handed.<eos> This is too important.<eos> You won't get anyone else.
I'm coming with you.<eos> I'll find some gear.<eos> He's right.<eos> He's not right.<eos> He's sixteen.<eos> Why was she stealing carrots, Rune?<eos> What?<eos> Why was that girl stealing all those carrots?<eos> Because.<eos> You want to stay safe in this place.

No.<eos> None.<eos> No one has reported anyone missing.<eos> So he could be a newcomer, a visitor?<eos> Yeah, or someone without any friends.<eos> I just popped in on my way to the airport.<eos> Sorry, Vincent.<eos> Gotta go.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Catch up when you get back...
Health...<eos> Health issues.<eos> Ever since...<eos> Oh. Well. Vincent, I'm sorry my husband isn't here.<eos> I'm sure Eric would like to say goodbye properly.<eos> - He did.<eos> - What?<eos> He said goodbye yesterday.<eos> On the glacier.<eos> You saw him?
They were running rampage through the town.<eos> A research student was savaged.<eos> I really think you've got the wrong dogs.<eos> No.<eos> No, we haven't.<eos> The gate is open.<eos> Oh, my God, they are all gone.<eos> Like all the dogs...<eos> Its spine has.... the... the spine has been removed.<eos> You eat when I say, you sleep when I say.

Shit!<eos> Shit!<eos> - What happened?<eos> - I just...<eos> - Give me that.<eos> What the fuck happened, Lamont?<eos> I don't know, skipper.<eos> I was down below... and smelled the smoke.<eos> Dad. I'm going with Tannar.<eos> What the hell are you doing?
What the fuck happened, Lamont?<eos> I don't know, skipper.<eos> I was down below... and smelled the smoke.<eos> Dad. I'm going with Tannar.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Greenhorn's share. Half a per cent of Tannar's catch...<eos> She needs this.<eos> _<eos> Goodnight, Natalie.<eos> If you're too repressed to say it, I'm not.

"I'll only miss you if you zig-zag."
Watch out!<eos> Hey, you!<eos> Hey.<eos> Stop!<eos> Hey, you.<eos> Hey!<eos> Dan?<eos> Dan?<eos> - _ - Bad things come at night.<eos> You'd loaded the gun yourself.
Why you hooking' up my cousin's car?<eos> He needed money, I gave it to him.<eos> He can't pay, I take the car.<eos> I just need a few more days.<eos> "Few more days" wasn't part of the deal.<eos> Come on.<eos> You make a deal, you gotta live up to it.<eos> You make a deal, you gonna live up to it.<eos> "Gonna" live up to it?<eos> Oh, so you're one of those types. You take everyone-'s ride, and then ship it back to the States?

How?<eos> Race for it.<eos> I already own it, bro.<eos> Not that car.<eos> Mine.<eos> Dom, his car is the fastest car on the island.<eos> Do you know what he has under that hood?<eos> He knows it doesn't matter what's under a hood.<eos> The only thing that matters is who's behind the wheel.<eos> You think so?
Done.<eos> I appreciate what you're trying to do, but my car is the slowest car on the island.<eos> Was.<eos> Pull the seats, the doors, the battery...<eos> If it ain't the motor, take it off.<eos> Laughing gas?<eos> Nah, Fed.<eos> This is Cuban NOS.<eos> You guys are crazy.<eos> What are you doing?

I don't know.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Ghost him.<eos> Adios, Toretto!<eos> Okay, Buster.<eos> Let's see if this works.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> Lookout!<eos> A clears a deal.<eos> You won my car.
And you earned my respect.<eos> Keep your car.<eos> Your respect is good enough for me.<eos> Yo, cousin...<eos> Sorry about your car.<eos> Yours was too slow for a Toretto, anyway.<eos> Your Impala?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Look at that smile.<eos> I love it when you smile.
I love it when you smile.<eos> You make me happy.<eos> Mmm, I think this place makes you happy.<eos> It's like it speaks to you.<eos> You remember that guy, the racer and his dad?<eos> The one with the boat engine under the hood? Yeah!<eos> Yes.<eos> Of course.<eos> I was looking at them, and I...<eos> And I couldn't help but to imagine what you'd be like if you were a dad.

I love to play games.<eos> I've beaten the best of 'em.<eos> But I'm kind of in a rush, so if you've got something to say to me...<eos> Oh, this is a very different game, that I can assure you.<eos> This...<eos> There's something much greater at work here.<eos> This is fate.<eos> I choose to make my own fate.<eos> Not today.<eos> Is this the road you take to your apartment every morning?

I want you to work for me.<eos> Work for you?<eos> Oh, I could've saved you a lot of time, then.<eos> See, I don't work for anyone.<eos> You can't walk away from this, Dom.<eos> We're gonna have this conversation, one way or the other.<eos> You see, that's the funny thing about fate.<eos> It's cunning.<eos> It can bring you beautiful things, and it can also bring you moments like this.<eos> Oh, you're gonna want to work for me.
That Damocles 7 EMP weapon that went missing in the Gulf? Arms dealers from the Liberation Front have it in Berlin.<eos> Shit!<eos> This thing can wipe out an entire electrical grid in a major city.<eos> No lights, no power.<eos> Instant Stone Age.<eos> Chloe, Maya, you can't let her run by you like that.<eos> Let's go, let's go!<eos> Cross!<eos> Agent Hobbs, this is a Class Four WMD.<eos> Do you have any idea what's at stake here?
Tay Tay?<eos> Taylor Swift.<eos> Gotta be shittin' me.<eos> Get it together, okay?<eos> Let's go, girls!<eos> We need you to do this.<eos> It's a lot of lives at stake.<eos> All right, but I need to be clear here.<eos> The US government cannot sanction this operation in any way.<eos> You're on your own. Hey.
Yes!<eos> That is my daughter right there. Yes.<eos> Yes, come here.<eos> How did I do?<eos> Awesome.<eos> Nice job, kid.<eos> Daddy's gotta go to work?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Daddy's gotta go to work.<eos> Now, you're gonna need to get a team you can trust.
Hey, Dom.<eos> Hey, Hobbs.<eos> I got a job in Berlin and I need a favor, brother.<eos> No problem.<eos> I'll grab the team and meet you in Berlin.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Hi see you soon.<eos> You were only supposed to create a diversion, Roman.<eos> That was a diversion!<eos> How many of the damn explosives did you use?
So you just gonna keep that to yourself'?<eos> What happened to Phase One?<eos> What about that part?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Remember the airplane?<eos> Everyone drove their cars out but you?<eos> I told you, my engine seized up.<eos> It's your balls that seized up.<eos> Just follow my lead, okay?<eos> And, Roman, whatever you do, don't think.
I told you, my engine seized up.<eos> It's your balls that seized up.<eos> Just follow my lead, okay?<eos> And, Roman, whatever you do, don't think.<eos> Tel, drop it.<eos> Bombs away.<eos> Split, now!<eos> Holy...<eos> Great plan, Tej.<eos> But just so you know, you missed some.
Got your ass.<eos> You good?<eos> I'll see you when it's done.<eos> All right, great job, team.<eos> Let's break off and meet me at the safe house.<eos> A hell of a job, brother.<eos> When we get back to the base, the beefs on me.<eos> You lost your goddamn mind, Toretto?<eos> Toretto, you put hands on that thing, you're gonna have the whole world gunning for you, including me.<eos> I don't know what you're doing, but you better think about this, Toretto.

It's a whole bunch of calls to untraceable numbers.<eos> Burner phones, right?<eos> Nah, scrambler.<eos> Same number, but they got some sort of micro-router to bury the signal path, which means Dom is clearly communicating with somebody that's above our pay grade.<eos> Look, I don't know Dom as well as you, but if we just look at the facts,<eos> Dom's been having highly encrypted conversations with some mysterious person.<eos> He took out Hobbs.<eos> He stole an EMP.<eos> Now he's disappeared.<eos> So, what are you saying?

Officially, you will be a criminal.<eos> Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> You need to work on your delivery, all right?<eos> Unofficially... You're off the books. You come work with me.<eos> I'm not a criminal.<eos> Luke, come on. Labels.<eos> There is no confession.<eos> There are no backroom deals.<eos> I got myself into this, I'm gonna get myself out of it.<eos> You know that.
Now, come on, give him a break.<eos> Give me a break.<eos> Luke.<eos> Appreciate it.<eos> It's good to see you, Nobody.<eos> You, too.<eos> Rule number one...<eos> Know your audience.<eos> I gave you your shot.<eos> You shit the bed.
Luke.<eos> Appreciate it.<eos> It's good to see you, Nobody.<eos> You, too.<eos> Rule number one...<eos> Know your audience.<eos> I gave you your shot.<eos> You shit the bed.<eos> Now I'm gonna show you how to get this done.<eos> You're dead, cop. Dead!
You know, that color looks good on you.<eos> Yeah, it'll look a whole hell of a lot better with your blood on it.<eos> Yeah, good luck with that, Hercules.<eos> Lawman gone bad, huh?<eos> Such a cliché.<eos> Oh, well, welcome to the club.<eos> I wouldn't get that twisted, son.<eos> We ain't in no club, we got nothing in common.<eos> And unlike you, I ain't gonna be here long.<eos> What, you bring a shovel, did you?
Better get to digging.<eos> Wanker.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Move.<eos> Say that again.<eos> If I say it again, it'll be to a corpse.<eos> I'm gonna enjoy this.<eos> Welcome back, Dom.<eos> Nice job out there.<eos> You excited about tonight?
Wanker.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Move.<eos> Say that again.<eos> If I say it again, it'll be to a corpse.<eos> I'm gonna enjoy this.<eos> Welcome back, Dom.<eos> Nice job out there.<eos> You excited about tonight?<eos> You're going on this?
You excited about tonight?<eos> You're going on this?<eos> You're with me, Dom.<eos> Showing me your shoe collection?<eos> Yep.<eos> A pair for every occasion.<eos> You have enough guns in hereto outfit a small army, huh?<eos> Oh, this is just the tip of the iceberg.<eos> You know what I like about you, Dom?<eos> You're a genuine outlaw.

This way... I changed him.<eos> That's not your responsibility.<eos> But it's who I am.<eos> Is it?<eos> Let me ask you something, Dom.<eos> What's the best thing in your life?<eos> Family.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Not if you're being honest<eos> It's the 10 seconds between start and finish, when you're not thinking about anything.
Let me ask you something, Dom.<eos> What's the best thing in your life?<eos> Family.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Not if you're being honest<eos> It's the 10 seconds between start and finish, when you're not thinking about anything.<eos> No family, no obligations.<eos> Just you.<eos> Being free.<eos> I gotta tell you, this whole saving-the-world, Robin Hood nonsense you've been doing recently?
I gotta tell you, this whole saving-the-world, Robin Hood nonsense you've been doing recently?<eos> It's bullshit.<eos> It's not you.<eos> Be who you are.<eos> Why live only a quarter mile at a time when you can live your whole life that way?<eos> Is that it?<eos> Is that all those bloated-out muscles will give ya?<eos> All show and no go.<eos> Oh, I got plenty of go.<eos> You must've misplaced that when I kicked your arse up and down that office of yours.
Oh, I got plenty of go.<eos> You must've misplaced that when I kicked your arse up and down that office of yours.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just like you Brits, rewriting history, huh?<eos> All I know is, it wasn't me that was thrown out of a four-story window.<eos> Jumped.<eos> I jumped out of a four-story window, saving my partner's life.<eos> 'Cause where I'm from, we don't settle fights by throwing bombs.<eos> Well, that's funny, because where I'm from, we don't need women to run to our rescue.<eos> I mean, do you really believe you can stand in front of me and beat me in a straight-up, old-fashioned fist fight'?
Keep waiting, bitch.<eos> Rubber bullets.<eos> Big mistake.<eos> Well, that took longer than I expected.<eos> Two questions.<eos> MR. NOBODY; Yeah.<eos> My daughter?<eos> With your sister.<eos> Toretto?<eos> It's interesting you ask.
I've been in here for four hours, and my ribs are showing.<eos> I don't know about y'all, but I'm out.<eos> I wouldn't recommend that What?<eos> Well, thanks to your botched Berlin job, you all made Interpols Top 10 Most Wanted list.<eos> - Top 10. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> That's all right.<eos> Well, not you, Roman.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You just missed the cut.<eos> You're number 11, so...
Maybe we find Dom, huh?<eos> Well, first, let's catch him, and then figure out why he's turned.<eos> So, y'all want us to track Dom.<eos> Yeah, I know, Roman, it's kind of a big job.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> Which is why I'm bringing in an extra pair of hands.<eos> Ah, my day just got a whole hell of a lot better.<eos> Mr. Nobody, you wanna tell me why you just put me in a room with this tea-and-crumpets eating, criminal sumbitch?<eos> What a big mouth on a small head, coming from Prisoner 6753.<eos> Don't think we've forgotten everything that you've done.
Ah, my day just got a whole hell of a lot better.<eos> Mr. Nobody, you wanna tell me why you just put me in a room with this tea-and-crumpets eating, criminal sumbitch?<eos> What a big mouth on a small head, coming from Prisoner 6753.<eos> Don't think we've forgotten everything that you've done.<eos> We are not teaming up with this guy.<eos> Let's get one thing clear.<eos> I ain't on your team.<eos> I don't care about you, your crew, or your little family.<eos> I'm here for Cipher.<eos> What are you gonna do, apply for a job? Head Asshole?
You should get a bigger size.<eos> Cipher came to me first.<eos> Wanted me to steal Nightshade for her.<eos> When I said no, she went after my brother.<eos> Ah, yes, brother Owen.<eos> Who could forget him, huh?<eos> Former hell-raiser and current guest at a nasty little black site prison.<eos> Cipher corrupted him and left him for dead.<eos> So, if I get a shot to take her down, believe me, Flex, I'm taking it.<eos> You're taking my boot right up your ass, is what you're taking.
Yeah.<eos> Wait.<eos> We've got a second match in Hong Kong.<eos> Beijing and Seoul.<eos> And Tokyo.<eos> And just about every other major city on the planet.<eos> And so, God's Eye was where we started.<eos> But Cipher's already created an evasion that masks their location by pinging random spots all over the globe, but it was a good thought, Roman.<eos> So, she's made my program obsolete.<eos> And that, Ramsey, is why you're here.

Did you all enjoy that?<eos> Next-generation concussion grenade.<eos> It scrambles your senses.<eos> Don't worry, it'll wear off in an hour.<eos> Probably.<eos> Hello, Deckard.<eos> Nice to see you again.<eos> Look at this, body's not even cold, Dom.<eos> Your family's already replacing you.<eos> You chose the losing team.
Nice to see you again.<eos> Look at this, body's not even cold, Dom.<eos> Your family's already replacing you.<eos> You chose the losing team.<eos> I guess your brother is smarter than you.<eos> Smart move, embedding God's Eye into the mainframe.<eos> Irritating to make me have to come all the way clown here to get it, but...<eos> Let's go.<eos> Dom!<eos> You're gonna turn your back on family?

We agreed on that<eos> I know.<eos> Back there, was that for her, for me, or you?<eos> And was it even necessary?<eos> Necessary?<eos> Nothing is necessary.<eos> Everything is a choice.<eos> And I simply made one.<eos> But so did you.<eos> You could've stopped me, but you chose not to.
And was it even necessary?<eos> Necessary?<eos> Nothing is necessary.<eos> Everything is a choice.<eos> And I simply made one.<eos> But so did you.<eos> You could've stopped me, but you chose not to.<eos> I wonder what Letty thought about that.<eos> The problem with putting your foot on a tiger's neck is you can never let it up.<eos> I think I need to remind you why you chose to be here.
Dom?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You shouldn't have come.<eos> Nothing could have kept me away.<eos> Now she has the three of us.<eos> Do you wanna see him?<eos> See Papa?<eos> See Papa.<eos> Papa.<eos> When I realized I was pregnant, you had just found out Letty was alive.
I call him Marcos.<eos> But that's his middle name.<eos> I thought his father should give him his first name.<eos> I'm sorry, Dom.<eos> There's nothing to be sorry for.<eos> Whatever happens, just save our son.<eos> Your son.<eos> Good visit?<eos> I know.<eos> I know what you're thinking.
I thought his father should give him his first name.<eos> I'm sorry, Dom.<eos> There's nothing to be sorry for.<eos> Whatever happens, just save our son.<eos> Your son.<eos> Good visit?<eos> I know.<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> I just let the guards go, so there's only two opponents in the room.<eos> Rhodes has the gun, so you'll take him out first.

So much to think about.<eos> Let me make it easier for you.<eos> Do with it as you wish.<eos> Have you heard of Choice Theory, Dom?<eos> There is a bunch of axioms, but only two you really need to concern yourself with.<eos> One, the only person's behavior we can control is our own.<eos> And, two, the only thing we can truly give another person is information.<eos> So, let me give you some.<eos> You see these cameras in here?<eos> The moment you make a move, highly-paid men with weapons will make their way into this room with one very specific instruction.
And, two, the only thing we can truly give another person is information.<eos> So, let me give you some.<eos> You see these cameras in here?<eos> The moment you make a move, highly-paid men with weapons will make their way into this room with one very specific instruction.<eos> It's not to save me.<eos> It's to kill your son.<eos> Now, that's a lot of bullets, and it only takes one for you to lose everything.<eos> So, I have to ask you, because I know family is so important to you.<eos> Is that really a choice you want to make?<eos> Because I'm ready if you are.
Wait a minute, guys, I think Deckard's actually onto something.<eos> How do you think Dom and Cipher got into the country without us knowing?<eos> Ghost flights.<eos> I thought untraceable aircraft was all Internet conspiracy stuff.<eos> It's not.<eos> Satellites and radar grids all across the globe shift like an ocean.<eos> They've got channels that open and close.<eos> And theoretically' if you know the right people who know the right patterns...<eos> You can fly right through the blind spots completely undetected.<eos> So you know where Dom is headed?
It's neon orange.<eos> The International Space Station would see it coming.<eos> Go choose anything less conspicuous.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Calipers are my...<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> Not happening.<eos> Hey, my man, you can put that down rig ht there.<eos> This is a gift, a real gift.<eos> I know what you're doing.

This is ridiculous.<eos> Not happening.<eos> Hey, my man, you can put that down rig ht there.<eos> This is a gift, a real gift.<eos> I know what you're doing.<eos> I like your beard.<eos> You're Blanta. Black Santa?<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> Put it down right there.<eos> What are you doing?
I like your beard.<eos> You're Blanta. Black Santa?<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> Put it down right there.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Engine's misfiring.<eos> I gotta check it out.<eos> No, that's not part of the plan, Dom.<eos> Clearly.<eos> But unless you want the engine to seize on the job...
Five minutes.<eos> I want another visual.<eos> I got an ATM.<eos> I don't like this.<eos> I want to see Toretto.<eos> There are no more cameras.<eos> Then find something!<eos> Punch in on something reflective.<eos> A car mirror, anything.<eos> Do you know who I am?
A car mirror, anything.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> It's why I'm here.<eos> Do you know what I'm capable of?<eos> It's why I'm here.<eos> I'll give you until I finish me cuppa.<eos> And I'm fucking thirsty.<eos> I've got limited time, so I won't take up too much of yours.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, you've already taken everything I have of value, Mr. Toretto.
When he reached for me, I couldn't hold him.<eos> It's the worst pain I ever felt.<eos> I know you know exactly how that feels.<eos> Maybe we could change that<eos> Now, why do I think you're about to suggest something really dodgy, Mr. Toretto?<eos> It's why I'm here.<eos> Jesus, punch in on something.<eos> I'm not liking this.<eos> Somethings not right.<eos> - Rhodes, you close?
Sound familiar, huh?<eos> You want to give me a hand?<eos> On three? Yeah.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> You know what, Twinkle Toes?<eos> In another life, I bet me and you could've done some serious damage.<eos> Yeah, we could've.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Shame I'm gonna have to bounce your head off the fender when this is all over.<eos> Ah, well, with all due respect, Captain, when this whole thing is over, we're gonna find a location, and I'm gonna knock your teeth so far down your throat, you're gonna stick a toothbrush right up your ass to brush them.
We're closing in on 'em.<eos> You guys ready?<eos> One thing I can guarantee, Dom, no one's ready for this.<eos> I want every chip with a zero-day exploit in a two-mile radius around that motorcade now.<eos> There's over a thousand of them.<eos> Hack 'em all.<eos> It's zombie time.<eos> I'd buckle up if I were you.<eos> Hmm?<eos> What are you doing?
Get out of there, Dom.<eos> Guys, I know why Dom's here.<eos> Police scanners are saying he stole a nuclear football.<eos> It's over, Toretto.<eos> Get your ass outta the car now.<eos> So, that's how you wanna play this?<eos> Let's play-<eos> Don't do this, Dom.<eos> He's going for it!<eos> What are you doing?
Stop working on it and do it.<eos> No, no, no, this my Bentley!<eos> No! No!<eos> Get that case and run.<eos> Move.<eos> They thought this was gonna be a street fight.<eos> What are you waiting for, Toretto?<eos> No!<eos> Letty, stop!<eos> What are you gonna do?
No, no, no, this my Bentley!<eos> No! No!<eos> Get that case and run.<eos> Move.<eos> They thought this was gonna be a street fight.<eos> What are you waiting for, Toretto?<eos> No!<eos> Letty, stop!<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I don't know why you're doing this, but I know one thing.
No! No!<eos> Get that case and run.<eos> Move.<eos> They thought this was gonna be a street fight.<eos> What are you waiting for, Toretto?<eos> No!<eos> Letty, stop!<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I don't know why you're doing this, but I know one thing.<eos> You love me.
Let's go, then.<eos> Anything?<eos> They're gone.<eos> And DOD confirmed it was a nuclear football.<eos> He's got an EMP and nuclear launch codes.<eos> I don't know what it is, but they're building towards something.<eos> Deckard?<eos> He didn't make it.<eos> I'm disappointed in you, Dom.<eos> When push came to shove, you were gonna let Letty just walk away with the codes.

They are adorable little things, aren't they?<eos> God, I hope I don't hurt him.<eos> Look, psychotic, I did exactly what you asked me to do.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> This is your doing.<eos> My doing?<eos> Dada.<eos> Please don't hurt him, I'm begging you.<eos> I don't want you to beg.<eos> I want you to learn.
I recognize that guy.<eos> That's Connor Rhodes.<eos> I met him when I was working with Shaw's brother.<eos> He wanted us to get the Nightshade device for him.<eos> Connor Rhodes.<eos> He's also linked to somebody I'd quite like to forget.<eos> It's Mose Jakande.<eos> Warlord who tried to get God's Eye.<eos> Which means that's twice that Dom has messed up Cipher's business.<eos> Everything you're feeling right now, this rage, a sense of loss, it's not real.
Which means that's twice that Dom has messed up Cipher's business.<eos> Everything you're feeling right now, this rage, a sense of loss, it's not real.<eos> Ifs a survival instinct wired deep into our brains to ensure continuation of the species.<eos> When early man would visit a watering hole, if they didn't watch their child, and it got snatched by a crocodile,<eos> our brains would create a painful but instructional memory, so it would never happen again.<eos> This idea of "family" that is so core with you, that rules your world,<eos> it's a biological lie.<eos> You don't have to accept it.<eos> I don't.<eos> Did you really think you could destroy two of my teams without any repercussions?

And what's that?<eos> Accountability.<eos> The second I fire off one of those nukes, I put the superpowers of this world on notice that, when they cross the line,<eos> I'm gonna be there to hold them responsible.<eos> Because the truth is, Dom, to the world out there,<eos> I am the crocodile at the watering hole.<eos> We've got one last job to do.<eos> Cipher.<eos> If I were you, I'd kiss my son.<eos> Because whether you value it or not, all of this, your plane, your security, and you, are still on this earth because of him.
But there's nothing in Vladovin.<eos> It's just ice.<eos> That's funny.<eos> Could've sworn there was a secret Russian naval base where they retrofitted Cold War submarines.<eos> Well, technically, it's not Russian anymore.<eos> The base was taken over by a terror group of military separatists about a month ago, and the Russians haven't taken it back yet, so there is a little window of opportunity here.<eos> Russian submarines.<eos> Nuclear football.<eos> It sounds like everything we do, our legs gonna be blown off.<eos> It sounds like you still number 11 on the list.
Ladies know me.<eos> They know where I'm at with it.<eos> I tried to take a piss, I didn't even recognize myself.<eos> Man, that's entirely too much information.<eos> I'm just sayin'.<eos> Well, one thing's for sure.<eos> Dom's gotta be either working with them or making a trade, because no one would be this insane to hit this place without a damn army.<eos> I wouldn't be so sure about that.<eos> Speak of the devil.<eos> All right, Dom, you're one step closer to that family reunion.
She's good.<eos> They're entering the weapons room.<eos> Oh, that's cute.<eos> Pull!<eos> Pull!<eos> Roman, Roman!<eos> We gotta find the chip, go!<eos> Oh, she's slick.<eos> Gonna have to do better than that, though.<eos> Okay, now you're starting to piss me off.
Oh, that's cute.<eos> Pull!<eos> Pull!<eos> Roman, Roman!<eos> We gotta find the chip, go!<eos> Oh, she's slick.<eos> Gonna have to do better than that, though.<eos> Okay, now you're starting to piss me off.<eos> Ramsey, how much time we talkin' here?<eos> You're smart, but not smart enough.
Roman, Roman!<eos> We gotta find the chip, go!<eos> Oh, she's slick.<eos> Gonna have to do better than that, though.<eos> Okay, now you're starting to piss me off.<eos> Ramsey, how much time we talkin' here?<eos> You're smart, but not smart enough.<eos> She's locked me out.<eos> Tej, I can't stop her.<eos> You're gonna have to pull that chip.
I got it!<eos> What in the hell are you guys doin'?<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> It wasn't me, okay?<eos> It'll be labeled "Guidance Go."<eos> Guidance Go, Guidance Go...<eos> Okay, I got somethin'.<eos> What?<eos> It says...<eos> Do you understand that?
What's the matter, Roman?<eos> Forgot your snow tires?<eos> You lovin' that Lambo now?<eos> All right, everyone.<eos> We'll deal with that launch chip later.<eos> Right now, I want that sub in deep water where no one can find it.<eos> Find me the fastest route out of that bay.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Why are they shootin' at me?<eos> Maybe 'cause you're in an orange Lamborghini, I don't know.

I know how much these people mean to you.<eos> So I will let you pick the first target.<eos> I don't pick a target from a mile away.<eos> I stand face to face and look 'em dead in the eye.<eos> Okay.<eos> The wife it is.<eos> Nice plane.<eos> I'm gonna enjoy having this.<eos> Hey, don't go gettin' any ideas.<eos> You and planes don't have a good history.
Don't be such a baby.<eos> Get to the pilot.<eos> He's got the second key.<eos> Wait for my signal.<eos> Give Cipher my regards.<eos> Did Toretto hold up his end of the deal?<eos> He gave us this little thing here.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Don't touch.<eos> You can track Cipher with this, but you can't do this on your own.

He's got this thing. It can see everything.<eos> It's like... It's called the Devil's Bum Hole or something.<eos> It's called the God's Eye.<eos> Yeah, well, whatever.<eos> There's no way I'm using Owen, all right?<eos> He's a lost cause.<eos> He's your brother, Decks.<eos> He's my son.<eos> He's our family. And our family don't die in bloody cages.<eos> How can you talk like that about Owen?

Owen.<eos> In position.<eos> Go.<eos> I'm in.<eos> I've got the package, Toretto.<eos> All 12 pounds of him.<eos> Dada.<eos> Dada.<eos> You made me miss my shot.<eos> What you think you're doing?
Dada.<eos> You made me miss my shot.<eos> What you think you're doing?<eos> Looking at you dead in the eye.<eos> That was for Elena.<eos> Rhodes.<eos> He's no longer with us.<eos> Rhodes picked the wrong target.<eos> Congratulations, Dom.<eos> You just killed your son.
Looking at you dead in the eye.<eos> That was for Elena.<eos> Rhodes.<eos> He's no longer with us.<eos> Rhodes picked the wrong target.<eos> Congratulations, Dom.<eos> You just killed your son.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> I just saved him.<eos> And you just look your foot off the tiger's neck.
Good to be riding with you again, man.<eos> Toretto just cleared the way for them.<eos> Someone, give me something!<eos> Torpedoes are ready.<eos> Then launch them!<eos> Shit.<eos> Take the wheel!<eos> I ain't taking' shit!<eos> Take the wheel!<eos> Where you goin'?
The torpedoes missed.<eos> They're gonna reach the lock before the sub does.<eos> The hell they are.<eos> Get ready for this.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> We're gonna need a bigger truck.<eos> It's right under us!<eos> Get out the way!<eos> Get us out of here!<eos> Why are you always yelling?
That's not good.<eos> That's not good.<eos> Please tell me there's nothing to worry about!<eos> We got this.<eos> That's my girl.<eos> The sub's too close.<eos> We ain't making it to the gate in time.<eos> We're just going to let it get away?<eos> Not if I know Dom.<eos> You lose, Dom.
That's my girl.<eos> The sub's too close.<eos> We ain't making it to the gate in time.<eos> We're just going to let it get away?<eos> Not if I know Dom.<eos> You lose, Dom.<eos> I destroyed two of your teams.<eos> I killed your red-headed boyfriend.<eos> And I put two killers on your untraceable plane.<eos> You lost the minute you interrupted my honeymoon.
All right.<eos> Come and get it.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Dive! Dive!<eos> This...<eos> This is for my son.<eos> Dom!<eos> You're out of bullets, Deckard.<eos> Not like I'm gonna need a gun to take care of you.<eos> How did you find me?
Yeah, you do.<eos> And you can start with that bitch.<eos> Now, that's Dominic Toretto.<eos> Hey, Dom!<eos> I'm just throwin' it out there, we need to get up outta here 'cause there's all kinda nuclearism happening under this ice.<eos> Relax.<eos> Without the trigger chips, those nukes are harmless.<eos> Okay. So we good, then.<eos> Let me go on and get my young selfie levels up.<eos> You realize this is classified, right'?
That is, if you want it.<eos> If I want?<eos> You know, after 16 years, I figure it's time for a little break.<eos> Wow.<eos> Daddy's swim' home.<eos> Nobody.<eos> Keep in touch.<eos> Ah. Hang on a second.<eos> This could be interesting.<eos> What made you think I'd do it?

Give us this day our daily bread...<eos> For as much as it hath pleased Almighty God of his great mercy to take unto himself the soul of our dear brother, here departed, we therefore commit his body to the ground.<eos> Earth to Earth ashes to ashes, dust to dust.<eos> In sure and certain hope of the Resurrection.<eos> We will change our vile body... according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself.<eos> Sir?<eos> Mr. Delaney, is it?<eos> Sir?<eos> - James Delaney, is it?<eos> - Who are you?

The pox in Africa goes directly to the brain via these... these worms.<eos> They... they crawl through your veins.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - He went to piss.<eos> Any business with him will be conducted in my presence.<eos> See, I have the advantage, I have read the will.<eos> Meaning what?<eos> Meaning I need to piss and need no-one to hold my cock.<eos> Begging the lady's pardon.<eos> How came you to know that your father was dead?
Meaning I need to piss and need no-one to hold my cock.<eos> Begging the lady's pardon.<eos> How came you to know that your father was dead?<eos> I heard he was sick and I boarded a ship.<eos> Yes, he was sick from madness.<eos> Hear that?<eos> Bile and bitterness.<eos> Not a single tear from anyone at the graveside.<eos> I didn't hear any piss at the leather.<eos> Perhaps you had no need, or perhaps you came out here with... With a purpose?

Perhaps by ship and by carriage.<eos> Hm? Come here.<eos> Ah!<eos> Where's your propriety, Brace?<eos> Servant and master?<eos> Get off me.<eos> - Begging your pardon, sir.<eos> - What, why?<eos> Begging your pardon, but what the hell are you doing here?<eos> Oh, no, there will be no pardon for you because you are the captain of the mutineers.
- What, why?<eos> Begging your pardon, but what the hell are you doing here?<eos> Oh, no, there will be no pardon for you because you are the captain of the mutineers.<eos> And you will hang. For being a pirate, you vagabond!<eos> How's the leg?<eos> I broke my left knee swinging from a tree, being an ape for you.<eos> - You needed a brother.<eos> - Still do.<eos> But a broken down, bent, buckled old butler will have to be sufficient.<eos> You look the same.
Two glasses.<eos> Sir?<eos> Fetch two glasses.<eos> They should have invited you.<eos> To the wake, at least.<eos> Serving stew in the backroom, to hell with that.<eos> In all of this dirty city, there is no-one that I can trust, do you understand?<eos> Apart from you.<eos> Ah!<eos> You can spare me the old maiden splutter, Brace.

I'd say, "Come on, come in.<eos> Before the tide gets your shoes."<eos> And he would light these fires on the shore, call out your name and talk to you.<eos> Is that grief, James?<eos> Is what grief?<eos> And all the while, these gulls hovered around picking at him.<eos> Gulls only come if there is meat.<eos> Oh, aye, meat there was.<eos> Men of affairs, they call themselves.<eos> Don't you want to know what it is they wanted, these gulls?
No.<eos> No, no, James.<eos> Your mother came from Naples.<eos> He bought some land and he bought a wife.<eos> And he bought them both for gunpowder.<eos> He told me never to speak to you of buying her.<eos> And yet he told me everything.<eos> When?<eos> When he lit his fires on the foreshore.<eos> Nothing you could tell me about that man would surprise me.
When he lit his fires on the foreshore.<eos> Nothing you could tell me about that man would surprise me.<eos> He was half human at the end and he would squat right here and make deals with ghosts in the flames.<eos> And he would speak in a language that was like...<eos> It was like ravens fighting.<eos> And he would talk to you, James.<eos> And he would talk to Anna.<eos> Salish.<eos> My mother's name was Salish.<eos> You know things only he and I knew.

Yeah.<eos> And it's best we never talk of her when we've had brandy.<eos> See, when you live alone with a madman, you...<eos> You become half mad yourself.<eos> But here's the thing, James.<eos> This Nootka Sound is a curse.<eos> It will bring the King and Empire down upon your head.<eos> Please don't talk to me of sense, Brace, because if it is you, I might believe it.<eos> And I have sworn to do very foolish things.<eos> If you're looking for money, those accounts are ten years old.
Each time, your da would go into the street, scoop up some horse shite and package it up by way of reply.<eos> I imagine the envelope contains a financial offer.<eos> I imagine it does.<eos> Do you have any horse shit on you?<eos> Listen, the accounts told me that we have a leasehold of 50 years on the offices in West India docks, 32 years left to run.<eos> Your father hadnae been up there in eight years, sir.<eos> They're all locked up.<eos> Then I will need the key.<eos> Oi!<eos> What are you doing with the door?

Yes, shit.<eos> Your father stopped coming.<eos> It was empty.<eos> It was wasted, so close to the docks.<eos> You want tea?<eos> No.<eos> Do you want to fuck?<eos> - No, I want my family offices back.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> How much do you make here?

- I have been in the world. - Oh.<eos> I have girls, but I also have men.<eos> They're not very good men.<eos> - You understand? - Mm-hmm.<eos> They have rocks for hearts.<eos> They have knives and ropes.<eos> If you have any sense...<eos> People who do not know me soon come to understand that I do not have any sense.<eos> Now, please do not misunderstand the situation.<eos> You send me 12 men, I will return you 12 sets of testicles in a bag, and we can watch your little whores devour them together, before I chop off your trotters and boil them.
You...<eos> I remember you.<eos> I remember you.<eos> Heard the stories.<eos> If I give you a girl, I will never see her again.<eos> You heard right.<eos> Be punctual.<eos> - They've brought the carriage up.<eos> - Yes. I'm coming.<eos> You're not imploring him to relinquish his deed, you're insisting that, for his own welfare, he submit his claim to you.

The offer of £50 should be conditional on him leaving England.<eos> Why?<eos> Because if he does not leave England, I will kill him.<eos> Why?<eos> That is a very good question.<eos> Why would I feel that way about him, after meeting him only once?<eos> The son of the same father as the woman I love...<eos> Why does a soldier know that a nigger bowing low has a dagger in his shoe and is reaching for it?<eos> Delaney is nothing more than a nigger now.<eos> You know that, don't you?

Apparently, they're happy to deal with the devil and leave us penniless.<eos> The letter, it seemed, did no good.<eos> He was never one to be told.<eos> Well, we have legal rights, and it's time that savage was made aware.<eos> - I know he's your brother but...<eos> - Half-brother.<eos> he leaves me no choice.<eos> - I'm going out.<eos> - Good.<eos> I'm tired of these empty threats you keep bandying around.

Mmm?<eos> Hmm...<eos> Good day.<eos> Well...<eos> The son is as unstable as the father.<eos> Perhaps the rumours about him are true.<eos> I'd hoped to settle this matter in a modern way, but that's not going to be possible.<eos> He's all yours.<eos> Dear James, the letter I sent to you this morning was written under the supervision of my husband, to whom I am happily married.<eos> It is more than ten years since you went away, and at the time I was grateful that you had decided to leave England, for both of our sakes.
When you first came back, you told me you loved me.
It is a place where, someday, I hope we will meet and be happy.<eos> In those days, I always chose boys who had the shadow of death on them.<eos> I thought they would be less likely to return.<eos> Of course, they do return... as ghosts.<eos> Now I'm older...<eos> How many boys?<eos> How many Company boys did you send to crew your private ships?<eos> Please, don't believe that I will say anything to confirm or deny any action past, present or future, in any regard whatsoever to this business.<eos> But the point is, you see...<eos> You didn't die, did you?
Please, don't believe that I will say anything to confirm or deny any action past, present or future, in any regard whatsoever to this business.<eos> But the point is, you see...<eos> You didn't die, did you?<eos> Not even over there, where everyone dies.<eos> No.<eos> No, I did not.<eos> I was rescued by an African... who saved me... and he cured me... and he showed me to myself.<eos> The things I did in Africa make your transactions look paltry.<eos> I witnessed and participated in darkness that you cannot conceive.<eos> And will you be including that in your account to the Royal Commission?

Hmm.

Mr Delaney is in need of a doctor, sir.<eos> He must be bluffing.<eos> Or has he fallen off the tightrope?<eos> Well, you go and bring the doctor, then.<eos> And we can all pray to God that we haven't completely fried his brain.<eos> Hold up!<eos> Out! The rest of you, out now!<eos> These gentlemen are actually here to rescue you.<eos> Atticus?<eos> If it was down to me, you'd have been dead long ago.

You've nothing to fear.<eos> What?<eos> Temple was on the foreshore.<eos> He saw James sleeping in the mud and Winter lay down beside him.<eos> He then saw a man arrive in a boat.<eos> "Moving like a ghost," Wasn't he?<eos> It was this ghost that killed your Winter, as she slept.<eos> The man then got back in the boat,<eos> Temple followed him along the foreshore, where he was met by someone on the other side.<eos> They were in a carriage, like the one you just came out of.

My products include paints and oils, but in particular powder.<eos> And for those of us who have secrets, marks, blemishes... we have ways of preserving those secrets.<eos> Those who use it will do almost anything for it, when their supply is exhausted.<eos> The name of the powder is Colonnade.<eos> And you have samples?<eos> Indeed.<eos> Perhaps I could show you in person how to apply it for best advantage?<eos> Ladies, I will be back before the sandwiches.<eos> How dull life was before Musgrove.<eos> What the fuck are you doing?
I'm ready.<eos> So, erm, now the witness is sewn together... we can begin.<eos> Please confirm that you are James Keziah Delaney of Chamber House, Wapping Wall, London... lately accused of conspiring with the members of the Secret Society of Correspondence... against His Majesty The King.<eos> And you have pledged to give us the names of the Americans who conspired with you, and others unnamed, to commit acts of treason within the confines of the City of London.<eos> Mr Delaney...<eos> Mr Delaney, unless you give up the names of your co-conspirators<eos> Every single stitch they have just put into your flesh I will pull out myself with my fingernails.<eos> Give us the names, or you will be racked!<eos> I will squash your balls myself and make you eat the paste.<eos> You promised to give me those names.
Yes?<eos> From Mr Delaney.<eos> 'I'm planning to journey to heaven, James.<eos> 'I've realised the truth.<eos> 'My cage is my flesh, I can shed it.<eos> 'The River Thames will take me to God.<eos> 'Death is just the turning of a key in a lock.<eos> 'Whether God will accept me is another matter, 'perhaps my husband will have spoken of my betrayal.<eos> 'Or perhaps my feelings for you, 'unforgiveable feelings for you, 'will mean the Thames will take me to a different place.<eos> 'Whatever my destination, if you survive your recklessness, 'please, keep some part of my soul inside your own.'

But long since, you've been dangled in front of the King of England by the East India Company.<eos> Now you're scrabbling, desperate.<eos> Pulling your wool over everybody's eyes.<eos> Possibly even your own.<eos> Does it even matter?<eos> No.<eos> No-one in this city has only one master.<eos> Pen.<eos> I do.<eos> 'James, you came back.

Fuck wills!<eos> Fuck treaties!<eos> I'm the head of fucking state!<eos> And by the command of His Majesty<eos> Kill him.<eos> Mary, Mary, out of the way!<eos> Where are you keeping everyone?<eos> In there.<eos> Right.<eos> You good?
He's a nightmare.<eos> Cole will kill him with his own cock, if he's not shot today.<eos> Can't kill him.<eos> Why?<eos> We need him.<eos> He's a doctor.<eos> Is the powder on the ship?<eos> 55 kegs onboard, 15 on the dock and two in the water.<eos> Right. Well, when we are 60 and ten, I need you to take the pilgrims and put them on the ship before the ebb.<eos> Where are you going?

I don't want you to tell them the plans.<eos> Besides, you're not coming.<eos> What?<eos> Brace, you have always been my father's man, in my father's world.<eos> We're headed to my mother's now.<eos> James, tell me this, too, is mercy.<eos> I'm an old man, I would never survive.<eos> Tell me that's the reason.<eos> Brace, you were not born for freedom.<eos> You wouldn't know what to do with it.
Sell this land for a reasonable price.<eos> Nootka Sound is not for sale.<eos> I can give you whatever you like - boys, girls.<eos> You have two hours to get out.<eos> I know things about the dead.<eos> I'd hoped to settle this matter in a modern way, but that is not going to be possible.<eos> He's all yours.<eos> This Nootka Sound is a curse. It will bring the King and Empire down upon your head.<eos> Pick it up.<eos> So, you've no problem with the principle of obeying me, just the execution.
Only Delaney's death will render it obsolete.<eos> This is going to bring the house down around it.<eos> Damn thing!<eos> Beg your pardon.<eos> So what's this for?<eos> To keep things safe.<eos> What things?<eos> And Brace?<eos> Go to hell!<eos> You marched with Tremain.
For the purpose of staying alive right now.<eos> You may choose to leave my services if you wish, Mr Brace.<eos> What is it about you bloody mad Delaneys?<eos> Hang it in the meat locker.<eos> Just keep the powder out of the steam.<eos> Bloody madhouse again!<eos> While we're on the subject of housekeeping, I mean to have a word with you about food.<eos> You're hungry?<eos> No.<eos> Toward the end, you said my father rarely ate.
You're hungry?<eos> No.<eos> Toward the end, you said my father rarely ate.<eos> Aye, he lived on air and honey beer.<eos> From where?<eos> From a man in Feather Lane.<eos> Look, it was cheaper than the tavern and, er, your father only gave me coppers.<eos> What man?<eos> A man who's since died... and his wife since left.<eos> Why do you ask?
Who, who did, sir?<eos> The fucking Americans!<eos> Atticus!<eos> James Delaney.<eos> Well, look at you.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Give me back my horse.<eos> What's the biggest thing you saw?<eos> For my files - my book about the world.<eos> What's the biggest thing you saw in Africa?
Sit down.<eos> Give me back my horse.<eos> What's the biggest thing you saw?<eos> For my files - my book about the world.<eos> What's the biggest thing you saw in Africa?<eos> An elephant.<eos> How tall was it?<eos> Atticus, give me my horse back.<eos> 100 foot high, some of them, I've heard.<eos> Atticus, you stole my horse and you left your name... so what do you want?

"Say he falls in, the current takes him, how about that?"<eos> So I says to the gentleman...<eos> "I sailed with old Horace all around the world."<eos> See?<eos> So I said, "You go or I'll slit your gizzard" "and drop you in the current you had planned with Captain Delaney."
So I said, "You go or I'll slit your gizzard" "and drop you in the current you had planned with Captain Delaney."<eos> And who was this gentleman?<eos> What was the smallest thing you saw?<eos> Human kindness.<eos> An ant.<eos> Was he a company man?<eos> I'd say he wasn't East India.<eos> More from up Leadenhall.<eos> I could tell by the cut of his jib.<eos> So, how much will you give me for not killing your father?
What the fuck is this?<eos> It's, um, from the East India.<eos> Fuck them as well.<eos> I intend to.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Winter. Miss Winter.<eos> No, just Winter.<eos> Just Winter.<eos> I live with the whores, but I'm a virgin.<eos> Why are you following me?
Too ugly.<eos> She says, one day, I'll catch a man and he'll carry me away.<eos> Someone like you.<eos> I spied you, too.<eos> Tell me about this man with the silver tooth...<eos> Winter.<eos> I can show you where he's moored, if you want.<eos> He sleeps on this ship alone?<eos> He takes a particular girl abroad and does mean things, but there's no-one else.<eos> Are you tricking me?
Why do you even believe I'm telling the truth?<eos> Because...<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> Well, I shall ask him why he's been sent to kill me... and by who.<eos> Stay.<eos> The very same smell.<eos> Same smell as what?<eos> As your father's clothes when he would go dancing on the foreshore and light his fires.<eos> Brace, where did my father keep his most important things?<eos> What is it you're looking for?

But what I do have are Malay coins, enough to bury you.<eos> Prayer beads, not enough to get you to heaven.<eos> And hashish, enough to ease my grieving when the East India Company slit your throat, which, of course, they will.<eos> You have appointments today.<eos> Breakfast will be out in half an hour... if you can contrive to stay alive that long.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That was turning out to be a long, drawn-out process.<eos> I'd benefit from a period of reflection.<eos> Do you have a girl here called Winter?<eos> You can have any girl you want.

I met her.<eos> People are saying you're mad.<eos> I am.<eos> I like to see what lies beneath.<eos> You have goodness in you.<eos> What goodness?<eos> You do, you do.<eos> You have goodness in you - I can see it in your eyes... and you have the same eyes as her.<eos> Winter, she's your daughter, isn't she?<eos> And that's why you don't rent her.

Am I wrong?<eos> I would rather that you worked with me rather than against me.<eos> Work at what?<eos> Necessary evil.<eos> And whorehouses are full of secrets, and secrets, to me, are weapons.<eos> I would very much like to talk business... but I would like you inside of me, Mr Delaney.<eos> It's my first condition.<eos> I need to know where Mr Silver Tooth is hiding.<eos> Your new friend.<eos> Do you know him?
See you..<eos> Help me!<eos> Captain!<eos> Holy Christ!<eos> Where the hell have you been?<eos> I made a fire in your room for the mice.<eos> In Parliament today, they'll be debating the beating of servants.<eos> The Whigs want to protect you.<eos> I believe that would lead to anarchy.<eos> Are you not ever hungry?
I made a fire in your room for the mice.<eos> In Parliament today, they'll be debating the beating of servants.<eos> The Whigs want to protect you.<eos> I believe that would lead to anarchy.<eos> Are you not ever hungry?<eos> I ate in the whorehouse.<eos> To qualify as food, it needs to be solid.<eos> I made some coffee - that'll be stone-cold.<eos> Aren't we all?<eos> Where the hell are you going now?
I'll deal first... with the beneficiaries and then with the division straight after.<eos> I said straight after!<eos> Shut up!<eos> Let them get on with it.<eos> We've waited long enough.<eos> Mr Delaney died a widower.<eos> He is survived by two children, both present at this division.<eos> Of his daughter, Zilpha Annabel Delaney, now Zilpha Annabel Geary, there is no mention in this last will and testament.<eos> To his son, James Keziah Delaney, is left the only existing assets of the Delaney estate, including the Nootka trading post and landing ground on the Pacific north-west coast of the Americas, in what was formerly Spanish America.<eos> Whatever you have, you will sell...
I have letters.<eos> Other than letters?<eos> Well, what kind of documents?<eos> Well, proof will come from pen and ink.<eos> I will dispatch an enquiry to the Trinity Church in Dublin and request a personal account from the priest. Until then,<eos> I suggest you two refrain from any further contact with each other.<eos> Well, I have no love for the theatre.<eos> And I spend very little time in German brothels.<eos> Was he in there?<eos> The man - did you see him in the room?
This widow will have sole claim on Nootka in the event of James Delaney's death.<eos> An event which may be imminent.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, please, welcome to London violin virtuoso Nicolas Mori.<eos> Tonight, composer Ludwig van Beethoven's Sixth Symphony.<eos> James, please, don't.<eos> What?<eos> I missed you.<eos> I couldn't bear to see you alone.<eos> Do you know, this is so old, I could even laugh at you?<eos> And yet you came outside to see me.

Well, that is a shame, isn't it?
I stitch you up and you give me information.<eos> I will cede sovereignty of Nootka Sound to whichever nation offers me their monopoly.<eos> All the tea in China.<eos> As Horace Delaney's widow, I also own half of the trading post at Nootka Sound.<eos> And I believe Nootka is of value to the King.<eos> If you are in contact with the King, then you are already in grave danger.<eos> I hope I can trust you to keep the secrets of the past buried.<eos> I am your sister.<eos> Let all else lie.<eos> You take the minutes and you log every meeting.

These men are from the Crown.<eos> I will warn the East India<eos> - and they will free you.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> You must go with them now.<eos> I will be with you when you're inside and you will know it.<eos> Hold out.<eos> Hello! Come with us!<eos> I got another one for ya!<eos> Aren't you a pretty one? !
So... doesn't that mean the game is up, James?<eos> No, it's just begun.<eos> What else?<eos> The hand was raised.<eos> They talked about gunpowder.<eos> Pettifer said if Delaney Trading Company wanted to trade with the Indians at Nootka, the only merchandise you could possibly use would be gunpowder.<eos> Wilton pointed out that in times of war, the production of gunpowder is controlled by the Crown.<eos> You will not be granted a licence to purchase.<eos> Your name is already on a blacklist.<eos> You will not get a single grain anywhere in England.
I got a carpenter to take down those boards and put up a new door.<eos> You should try a key next time.<eos> They've turned a few things over.<eos> We should bill the King.<eos> - She's back, yes?<eos> - Aye.<eos> How does she seem?<eos> The same.<eos> But then, she's an actress.<eos> You knew they were coming to take her, didn't you?
I'm actually very tired, Mr. Delaney.<eos> Your conspiracies have made it a very tiring day.<eos> I'll fix that.<eos> Sleep on it.<eos> Deliver us from evil, for thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, for ever and ever.<eos> Amen.<eos> John Company and the King are back at war.<eos> The resolution again recedes.<eos> Fuck him!<eos> You woke me.

- Two.<eos> The bat caves of Burma, where the bat shit refines itself, or the warehouse of the East India Company at Wapping Wall.<eos> Except, they're not selling, at the moment.<eos> War going on.<eos> Two wars, actually.<eos> Or have we already won one of them?<eos> You're hired, Mr. Cholmondeley.<eos> And as for your saltpetre, I will get it for you.<eos> He's the one.<eos> Who are you?
The lady asked me to wake her because she had a costume fitting.<eos> I guessed you wouldn't want her going out.<eos> No, the lady is free to come and go as she pleases.<eos> The Crown will protect her from the Company.<eos> And the Company will protect her from the Crown.<eos> And you are the joint in the seesaw.<eos> By the way, I found your red roses in the mud when I threw out the oyster shells.<eos> - Who's this?<eos> - Who the hell's what?<eos> Brace, do not believe that I will not know when you reseal my letters.
- Aye, sir.<eos> The Americans.<eos> Wanting a place on the seesaw.<eos> Well, it is an invitation for two.<eos> Miss Bow?<eos> Do you dance?<eos> Where is she?<eos> Where's Helga?<eos> I'll get her.<eos> Winter said you looked impressed.
Where's Helga?<eos> I'll get her.<eos> Winter said you looked impressed.<eos> I am.<eos> Oysters mask the smell of sex.<eos> You like that.<eos> Yes, I might have a use for that, actually.<eos> You may need to bring a couple of girls to the Dolphin with you.<eos> Now, shut for the evening.<eos> You're busy tonight.
You like that.<eos> Yes, I might have a use for that, actually.<eos> You may need to bring a couple of girls to the Dolphin with you.<eos> Now, shut for the evening.<eos> You're busy tonight.<eos> Right, a request to hire men and boats to collect barrels from the Prospect of Whitby pub and ferry them up the Fleet River to Hampstead.<eos> Barrels will contain... whores' urine.<eos> And that of the customers.<eos> Thruppence a barrel.<eos> I want you to sign that right now before whatever it is in your blood wears off.
Hello. Hello.<eos> Hello. Hello.<eos> Hello. Hello.<eos> Hello. Hello.<eos> Hello.<eos> Not hello.<eos> - Who the hell is that?<eos> - I've no idea.<eos> And who the hell was that?<eos> - Why are you here?
- I've no idea.<eos> And who the hell was that?<eos> - Why are you here?<eos> - Because I was invited.<eos> You?<eos> Because my husband was invited.<eos> He has business of theirs in Berlin.<eos> But it is a bit unexpected, isn't it?<eos> It's unusual.<eos> I knew that when you saw me, you would come to me and I realise that is how it always is.

It's unusual.<eos> I knew that when you saw me, you would come to me and I realise that is how it always is.<eos> You always drive me...<eos> It is a bit unexpected that we were both invited, is it not?<eos> That we were invited, both together.<eos> And if they invited us both, then they probably know.<eos> Who knows?<eos> Who knows?<eos> Our American friends.<eos> You feel me, don't you, when I break in?
That we were invited, both together.<eos> And if they invited us both, then they probably know.<eos> Who knows?<eos> Who knows?<eos> Our American friends.<eos> You feel me, don't you, when I break in?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - No.<eos> - You do. You feel me.
You feel me, don't you, when I break in?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - No.<eos> - You do. You feel me.<eos> And I could come more often, but I spare you.<eos> Then spare me.<eos> I went to a doctor, he took me to a priest who had been to a mission in Africa.<eos> - Yes, what did he say?<eos> - He said that you visit as animals.
- He said that you visit as animals.<eos> He couldn't even look at me after I'd told him.<eos> When I left England, I thought I was mad, but they taught me how to use it.<eos> It's the devil.<eos> Now, amongst other things, I am also a doctor.<eos> And I'd say the lady is in danger of catching more than just a chill out here.<eos> Your half-sister.<eos> Am I right?<eos> You're quite a prize, Mr. Delaney, quite a prize.<eos> I was told what you did to our first resort.

Nice work.<eos> Now, I make no moral judgments.<eos> And besides, Carlsbad said to say that you can have her.<eos> You can have her as part of the deal.<eos> Part of our second offering.<eos> So why don't you just take her?<eos> Just take her with you.<eos> No more hiding.<eos> We can guarantee you safe passage, anonymity... new worlds.<eos> But look, if you don't want to deal with the obstacle, we can certainly take care of that for you.
You will need to be.<eos> Your own sister.<eos> Goodness!<eos> Is he here?<eos> Is this real?<eos> Why's he here?<eos> Is it him?<eos> You should get away.<eos> Why is he here?<eos> You fu... you fucked her!
Why is he here?<eos> You fu... you fucked her!<eos> He fucked her.<eos> He fucked her!<eos> He fu...<eos> You need some air.<eos> James. Please, don't.<eos> James?<eos> James?<eos> You call this thing James?
He fucked her.<eos> He fucked her!<eos> He fu...<eos> You need some air.<eos> James. Please, don't.<eos> James?<eos> James?<eos> You call this thing James?<eos> You don't call him anything but nigger!<eos> You fucked her.
He fucked her!<eos> He fu...<eos> You need some air.<eos> James. Please, don't.<eos> James?<eos> James?<eos> You call this thing James?<eos> You don't call him anything but nigger!<eos> You fucked her.<eos> And you lay your hands on me in my society!
You call this thing James?<eos> You don't call him anything but nigger!<eos> You fucked her.<eos> And you lay your hands on me in my society!<eos> I know I will have my satisfaction.<eos> I declare it!<eos> I challenge James Delaney to a duel.<eos> At dawn... to the death.<eos> To the death.<eos> Do you accept?
What is it you're looking for?
So, how did it resolve itself?<eos> Did you both see sense?<eos> No.<eos> I shot him.<eos> Between the eyes.<eos> And a host of devils flew out of the hole in his head and down the river.<eos> In that event, it would be potatoes, wouldn't it?<eos> Simple sustenance.<eos> Life goes on.<eos> Before you drink any more, could you tell me what happened?
The Company can cause me a lot of difficulties, but only the King can have me hanged.<eos> The Crown will choose to make a deal.<eos> So I will not hang.<eos> Look, I'm very happy to admit that I don't want James Delaney to die.<eos> But can you also admit that you don't want James Delaney to die?<eos> You'll get me my trunk today.<eos> That's your business.<eos> All right?<eos> I don't want James Delaney to die either.<eos> Who are you?
Check below.<eos> You, check the bilges.<eos> - There's nothing.<eos> - Well, it can't have just vanished.<eos> What's this?<eos> Cellar empty.<eos> Apart from rats and river water, sir.<eos> Keep looking!<eos> Carry on.<eos> You've had a fall.
- There's nothing.<eos> - Well, it can't have just vanished.<eos> What's this?<eos> Cellar empty.<eos> Apart from rats and river water, sir.<eos> Keep looking!<eos> Carry on.<eos> You've had a fall.<eos> You probably don't remember who you are, so let me remind you.<eos> You've been following me, haven't you?
Apart from rats and river water, sir.<eos> Keep looking!<eos> Carry on.<eos> You've had a fall.<eos> You probably don't remember who you are, so let me remind you.<eos> You've been following me, haven't you?<eos> Now. Are you King or are you Company?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Now there is nothing up that road for you apart from death and anybody like you.<eos> So you run along and tell your friends how you almost lost your heart.
Which brings me to that rather delightful woman you were at the party with.<eos> An actress, she told me.<eos> Is she yours or... could a chemist call upon her?<eos> For tea or something?<eos> Show me the cargo.<eos> Brace!<eos> Brace, can you come and help me?<eos> What the hell happened here?<eos> Bloody soldiers raided the house.<eos> Did you hear me shouting?
Did you hear me shouting?<eos> Can't you see I'm busy?<eos> Where's James?<eos> How the hell should I know?<eos> Brace... what's the matter?<eos> I thought he'd burned that damned trunk on the foreshore along with everything else.<eos> It would float.<eos> Slip it into the ebb tide and let the river take it.<eos> Or it could burn.<eos> - Do you know what's inside it?
Stay.<eos> Sit. Sit there.<eos> I haven't told that boy anything.<eos> I didn't think it safe.<eos> The sacks of saltpetre in the barn were stolen.<eos> Why burden him?<eos> They were stolen from the Honourable East India Company.<eos> All right?<eos> Now anybody who knows of its whereabouts but does not report it is liable to hang.<eos> So, you are now one of us.
I know which one of you it is.<eos> And I want you to know that there will be no place for that man on my ship when we sail to the New World.<eos> Because he will be of no use to me.<eos> He will be of no use.<eos> For he will have no thumb.<eos> I am inside your heads, gentlemen.<eos> Always.<eos> £2 for broken doors and smashed windows.<eos> Damn soldiers!<eos> You owe me Delaney!
You'd risk the life of your son for chlorate?<eos> He is, isn't he?<eos> They have your name, Mr. Cholmondeley.<eos> They have your name, and you will be first on the list of their conspirators.<eos> How do they know so much?<eos> Get the chlorate.<eos> Yes?<eos> I will get you men.<eos> James...<eos> You said his name!

For nine years, you have been campaigning for a Royal Commission to investigate the drowning of these 280 slaves, which you say was done deliberately.<eos> It is my belief that some very powerful men in London were involved in an illicit shipment of slaves for personal profit, were complicit in the deaths of those slaves and in the subsequent concealment of the facts.<eos> And you believe that those men are senior directors within the Honourable East India Company?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Well then, Mr. Chichester, I have some good news for you.<eos> From the Prince Regent himself.<eos> Wilton!<eos> To be continued, gentlemen.<eos> Did you receive the box of bananas I sent you...<eos> You will improve your game.

To be continued, gentlemen.<eos> Did you receive the box of bananas I sent you...<eos> You will improve your game.<eos> You have to improve your fucking game!<eos> Those bastards at the palace have opened a royal commission into the sinking of The Influence.<eos> The-The-The Influence?<eos> Why?<eos> Well, it's a personal campaign.<eos> A stab in my ribs.<eos> Now, you will deal with it.

Offer him "full and unfettered co-operation"<eos> on behalf of the Honourable East India.<eos> No, no, no. "Full and willing cooperation."<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And then... I will tell you which papers to burn.<eos> Sir.<eos> There is a Mr. Delaney to see you, madam.<eos> He's come from the river.<eos> He's in the garden.<eos> If it's someone you fuck, please check if he came from east or west.
Well, that would require me to trust you.<eos> Based on mutual self-interest.<eos> Trust requires a little time.<eos> Something we have very little of, Mr. Delaney.<eos> What's this?<eos> A book from a Mr. Cholmondeley for Miss Bow.<eos> It came by post, with a letter.<eos> She obviously has an admirer.<eos> She asked me a lot of questions today.<eos> And did you give her a lot of answers?
Exi ergo, transgressor.<eos> Exi, seductor, plene omni dolo et fallacia, virtutis inimici, innocentium persecutor.<eos> Da locum, dirissime, da locum, impiissime.<eos> In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.<eos> Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> Can we untie her now?<eos> Leave her a few moments.<eos> Let her reflect... and recover.<eos> Will you come to bed?
Please understand that, from this moment, I will burn your letters without opening them.<eos> Then I will visit you in your dreams.<eos> James...<eos> I told the Priest how he visits you.<eos> There is a ceremony of exorcism, which can eradicate the Barbason.<eos> My mother's name was Salish.<eos> My father had her sent to Bedlam insane asylum.<eos> Mooning about in the chill.<eos> Staring into your head.<eos> You're as bad as your da.
My father had her sent to Bedlam insane asylum.<eos> Mooning about in the chill.<eos> Staring into your head.<eos> You're as bad as your da.<eos> My father cast my mother into madness, then jumped in straight after.<eos> He's scarcely a man to follow.<eos> He was a good man.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, a good man who killed his wife for convenience.<eos> You know nothing.
My father cast my mother into madness, then jumped in straight after.<eos> He's scarcely a man to follow.<eos> He was a good man.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, a good man who killed his wife for convenience.<eos> You know nothing.<eos> Always cow-eyed about your sainted mother.<eos> Or maybe it's about time you know about your mother.<eos> I do.<eos> Do you know she took you down to the river to drown you?
To protect you.<eos> To save your life, son.<eos> Desperate for your death!<eos> It took three men to pull you apart.<eos> She was clawing and spitting, dragged from the river howling and screaming.<eos> Be very, very careful now!<eos> She wanted you dead, James.<eos> Go away, Winter.<eos> I'm not scared of you.<eos> What are you scared of?

A family matter.<eos> Well, I-I shall call on Mr. Thoyt.<eos> Perhaps we can glean some knowledge from him.<eos> If there's any darkness, that articled pimp will know about it.<eos> And then I intend to visit Zilpha Geary.<eos> Why are you not worried?<eos> He won't be dead, and he won't be happy.<eos> You can depend on that.<eos> Open up!<eos> Open the door, we know you're in there!
I heard one about an actress he keeps locked in his cellar, - enjoys the beatings... - I don't need to...<eos> An actress... who enjoys walking with a man with human flesh in his teeth.<eos> You know, you can even buy a song about Delaney now.<eos> In Covent Garden, for a penny.<eos> I-I'll return when you're sober...<eos> It's about a cannibal who plans to eat the Prince Regent.<eos> So it can only be about Delaney.<eos> Forgive me, I was... just dressing.<eos> He's been gone two days...<eos> And she thought you might know where he is, because you are his sister.
All fires extinguished.<eos> Gently, gently, gently, gentlemen.<eos> Have the greatest of respect for the inhabitant of this coffin.<eos> Famously volatile.<eos> Given to explosive fits of rage.<eos> May he rest in peace until he's reignited with his Saviour.<eos> Slow, slow, slow over the potted roads.<eos> The chlorate is still there, it's just sleeping.<eos> "For the purpose of preventing contagion."?<eos> I saw you... and you saw something at the pond.

Good work, boy!<eos> Go on.<eos> Move out of here! Go!<eos> Gently.<eos> Careful not to wake the dead... as they reach their final resting place.<eos> I will tell Mr. Madison I have made an extraordinary discovery.<eos> A man in London who can be relied upon.<eos> Yes, you tell him that and I will rely upon him to give my ship safe passage through the American blockade.<eos> If my factory is discovered... I will know where to find you.<eos> You stink of cow shit.
You tell me one thing that isn't just a matter of time.<eos> They say you're going to sell the gun powder to the Republicans.<eos> Republicans haven't got any money, why would I sell it to them?<eos> They think you're going to start a revolution.<eos> If the Prince genuinely thought I was going to start a revolution, I would be in the Tower.<eos> He's not a safeguard.<eos> If Crown and Company solve their little dispute, they will crush you between them.<eos> What did my sister say?<eos> Zilpha?<eos> What have you done?

Quite dead.<eos> Sit there.<eos> - In the bedroom?<eos> - Yes.<eos> When did I, um...?<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You stay here.<eos> I will tell Brace to arrange a carriage.<eos> By the time you get home, the body will be gone.
- Yes.<eos> When did I, um...?<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You stay here.<eos> I will tell Brace to arrange a carriage.<eos> By the time you get home, the body will be gone.<eos> Home?<eos> Yes.<eos> - You are sending me home?
It is in fucking pieces.<eos> I swear, I swear I didn't know.<eos> Now report.<eos> War has begun.<eos> Sorry about your news.<eos> Marshall.<eos> I need a ship.<eos> And I need to ensure no-one else betrays me.<eos> Your man did not heed my warning...<eos> You don't want much, do you?
War has begun.<eos> Sorry about your news.<eos> Marshall.<eos> I need a ship.<eos> And I need to ensure no-one else betrays me.<eos> Your man did not heed my warning...<eos> You don't want much, do you?<eos> You were meant to be guarding his ship.<eos> Two possibilities.<eos> He sold you out, cos you cut off his thumb, or you cut off his thumb, cos you knew he was going to sell you out.
Find a ship tomorrow.<eos> Why don't you find a captain and you take him upstairs and slit his throat, and I will take his ship?<eos> No captains.<eos> No throat-slitting.<eos> We can't find you a ship.<eos> Mine!<eos> I need a ship!<eos> Just give me a fucking ship.<eos> James.<eos> What are you doing?
I would say heavy doses over a short period.<eos> Brace, what's the matter?<eos> The truth.<eos> Those bastards at the Palace have opened a Royal Commission into the sinking of the Influence.<eos> You are now one of us.

You are now one of us.<eos> You'll risk the life of your son?<eos> Zilpha.<eos> What have you done?<eos> I killed him.<eos> James, this powder is not ready to be moved because it is unstable.<eos> We are leaving because we have been betrayed.<eos> Sir Stuart just wants you to know... it's war.<eos> The gloves are off.<eos> James, what are you doing?
He's not in.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> Mr. Cholmondeley?<eos> Miss Bow.<eos> What's going on?<eos> A bastard.<eos> I thought, in all your charity, you might extend some sustenance and some shelter to this poor, unfortunate boy.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Robert. It's Robert.<eos> You know James Delaney, do you?
And how would you know that?<eos> - I very well may have.<eos> You might have done.<eos> But I do know you cared for her.<eos> You were kind to her.<eos> She told me.<eos> The boy Robert's arrived.<eos> You OK?<eos> Hello.<eos> Did you know Winter?
I will keep her soul.<eos> There's no certainty it was James that did it.<eos> There's no certainty that he did not.<eos> I'm getting scared, James.<eos> Too many bodies in the river.<eos> Can I sleep under your house tonight?<eos> No.<eos> Go away, I'm not fit to be near you now.<eos> James!<eos> You're among them now, aren't you?
In return, the Royal Commission will offer you a full pardon for your crime.<eos> For crime... it is.<eos> I have an alternative suggestion.<eos> In.<eos> I have a use for you.<eos> For the safe.<eos> Go.<eos> Murderer!<eos> Murderer!<eos> Do you know who blew up your ship?
Go.<eos> Murderer!<eos> Murderer!<eos> Do you know who blew up your ship?<eos> I've been thinking a lot about what happened, and... and I think we were right.<eos> There wasn't the time for such...<eos> And we have plenty of time.<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> When you first came back, you told me you loved me.

I believed once that we were the same person.<eos> We are.<eos> We are not.<eos> We are.<eos> Not any more.<eos> Perhaps you should thank your God for that.<eos> No.<eos> No, James.<eos> No.<eos> No, you can't do this.
- No fires within these walls.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> We're not moving the powder today, are we?<eos> So what's so urgent I had to dismount from a porky little Chinese?<eos> This is where they kept my mother.<eos> Something for your book.<eos> The lioness will fiercely protect her cubs, regardless of the consequences.<eos> Even if that means her certain death.<eos> Helga.<eos> Is that who you mean?

Yes.<eos> It is inevitable.<eos> Fix the roof.<eos> Gunpowder and water don't mix.<eos> Where's Brace?<eos> In his room.<eos> He's been there all day, either mad or sick or drunk.<eos> We knocked.<eos> He won't answer.<eos> Brace, you are not sick and you are not dead yet.

Pinch after pinch... after pinch.<eos> It's a great deal of poison.<eos> Still, we have rats.<eos> What's that?<eos> Your father's buttons... from his dress coat.<eos> I kept them.<eos> It was a kindness.<eos> For who?<eos> We couldn't go on, James.<eos> But you did.
It was a kindness.<eos> For who?<eos> We couldn't go on, James.<eos> But you did.<eos> You were dead.<eos> Everyone was at his throat.<eos> He was burning his own flesh!<eos> He had no need to go on.<eos> Nothing left to live for.<eos> So you did him a kindness.

Take them.<eos> You'll be held in a secure place until your pardon can be exchanged for your testimony in court.<eos> What?<eos> Ugh! Get off me!<eos> Don't hurt them!<eos> Get off me!<eos> Where is he?<eos> They would not be denied, sir.<eos> This is the Prince's house.<eos> You should have dragged them out on their arses.
James!<eos> James!<eos> You are betrayed!<eos> Two women came to Leadenhall...<eos> I know.<eos> Where are they now?<eos> A safe house.<eos> I have the address.<eos> I have a use for you.<eos> There's someone I need you to see.
I have only been clerk for 12 years.<eos> I have no idea how many years it was going on for...<eos> No, but you were present during the meeting when Sir Stuart concealed the facts about the sinking of the Cornwallis.<eos> Would you agree to testify?<eos> Mr. Chichester, would you please allow me a few moments alone?<eos> Now, listen here, Godders, I'm going to sail away, all right?<eos> And all of those who have use to me will sail along with me.<eos> And on my ship, there will be no rules and there will be no judgment.<eos> We're sailing to a new world and that is the plan.<eos> James... you are a fool.
No.<eos> No, their case will flounder.<eos> They can't.<eos> And we can make this happen.<eos> You and me.<eos> And the best of it... you will never have to testify.<eos> My ship will sail long before the commission even sits.<eos> All you have to do is make-believe... to this man here.<eos> All right?<eos> Now, you can do that, can't you?
Signed?<eos> And sealed.<eos> And if required, he will stand up in court?<eos> Let the good Lord be my witness...<eos> I will yell out the truth to the four winds.<eos> Until that happy resolution, I bid you good day, gentlemen.<eos> Mount up!<eos> To the Molly House!<eos> I cannot pack up my entire life in five minutes.<eos> Well, you can pack it up or you can lose it.
This is ridiculous.<eos> What about you?<eos> I'm being followed.<eos> The Crown have soldiers searching for me everywhere, so it ends here.<eos> Here?<eos> Yes.<eos> When?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Jesus Christ!<eos> Are you just going to sit? !
- Where's Temple?<eos> - He's not coming!<eos> Don't he want his share?<eos> - Hurry up, Temple!<eos> - Come on, Temple!<eos> Hello.<eos> I've been looking for you.<eos> I want her to forgive me.<eos> For what?<eos> You know it's a sin not to tell the truth in a sacred place.
It wasn't James that killed the girl, it was the Company, it was the East India Company.<eos> I need to tell James.<eos> Arsenic is gentle.<eos> It was mercy.<eos> Horace was no longer a Christian soul.<eos> I only wish I'd killed James, too.<eos> Give him a kind death.<eos> Protect him from himself.<eos> Instead, they've got him.<eos> What do you mean?
You allow me my meeting with Stuart Strange and perhaps, perhaps you will catch your Americans before they reach the ports.<eos> How long do you think it'll take?<eos> One, maybe two hours.<eos> Well, in that case, Mr. Delaney, Sir Stuart Strange is busy.<eos> Give us the Americans and then we'll stop!<eos> Sir!<eos> What did you say?<eos> Mr. Delaney, what did you say?<eos> Stuart Strange...<eos> Caddy... if you've lost your master, go to the clubhouse and ask.
Give us the Americans and then we'll stop!<eos> Sir!<eos> What did you say?<eos> Mr. Delaney, what did you say?<eos> Stuart Strange...<eos> Caddy... if you've lost your master, go to the clubhouse and ask.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Don't stand there gawping.<eos> I have no master, sir.<eos> Well, you're not a player.
We are aware that you have a certain... capacity for pain... which is why we've invited Dr. Ling.<eos> His unearthly potions... alter perceptions.<eos> The ducks will be flying.<eos> All the coaches to Bath and Southampton - are being searched, Your Highness. - For what?<eos> For whom?<eos> We have no idea who they are, who they pretend to be.<eos> It's been 12 hours!<eos> He will break.<eos> No, he won't.<eos> Goddamn it, where are you?
Mr. Delaney?<eos> Do you have anything to say to me?<eos> Mr. Delaney, do you have anything to say to me?<eos> Stuart Strange.<eos> Give him what he wants.<eos> This is absurd.<eos> My God, look at you.<eos> Well, your plan worked... you in a cell, me on a hook.<eos> I'm here.<eos> What do you want?
He bought some land and he bought a wife.<eos> Nootka was my mother's tribe.<eos> This small piece of land will be incredibly valuable to the Americans.<eos> Sell this land for a reasonable price.<eos> Nootka Sound is not for sale.<eos> I have something of great value to your nation, something the British are trying to kill me for.<eos> Someone has been brought to London to try and kill me, and I will need your eyes and ears from now on.<eos> You used to straighten your skirts and march away like nothing had ever happened.
Carlsbad said, "You know",<eos> Delaney might just be crazy enough to take us all on... "The King, the Company and the free fifteen."<eos> Maybe she was right.<eos> Well, you tell Carlsbad... from me... that I will cede sovereignty of Nootka Sound to whichever nation offers me their monopoly... on the trade of furs for tea from Fort George to Canton.<eos> A monopoly.<eos> That's what I want.<eos> All the tea in China.<eos> You should have said that from the start.<eos> Could have saved yourself a lot of pain.<eos> And you just said...
If the land lies on the border, it is an issue for the Crown.<eos> An issue of war.<eos> - And who is this man?<eos> Is he loyal?<eos> - Erm, well, we think not.<eos> A republican?<eos> An adventurer of very poor repute.<eos> Stories of madness, savagery, theft and worse.<eos> Then, Mr. Coop... he is a man that you will be able to do business with.<eos> You slept in a bird's nest.
- Give me brandy and bandages.<eos> - Who did this?<eos> A Malay with a knife and then an American with his needles.<eos> Brandy and bandages, man.<eos> - They'll try again.<eos> - Who, for God's sake?<eos> So, when the carpenter comes, tell him I want all the windows boarded up and that river hatch, I want that closed too.<eos> So... we are besieged.<eos> I suppose I can use the same carpenter to board up the windows that your father used when he was under siege and he can put the same old nails in the same old holes.<eos> You can sit there with the same old gun cocked on your lap.

I didn't say that you were my partner.<eos> The word along the Wapping Wall is you cut up an assassin and ate his giblets.<eos> Did you bring me my guns?<eos> Don't trust the snake.<eos> 10-bore Richardson Man Stoppers.<eos> Same power as a musket but you can hold one in each hand.<eos> Good. Better, better.<eos> - All right.<eos> - So if we ain't partners, what are we?<eos> Well, I'm a merchant, you're my victualler.
- All right.<eos> - So if we ain't partners, what are we?<eos> Well, I'm a merchant, you're my victualler.<eos> You can also be my ferryman.<eos> I can't use the roads... not for now at least.<eos> You see the heathen?<eos> He's my brother-in-law.<eos> He says the best bit of a man to eat is this.<eos> It's tender.<eos> Did you bring me salt beef?
Fresh from a sloop from somewhere cold.<eos> - Short notice.<eos> - We don't eat pig!<eos> All right, all right.<eos> The stuff he's brought has been on the dock for ages.<eos> Yes, probably, but I trust him, so please pay him.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Who are you?<eos> French Bill.<eos> - You all right?
- I know it's a boat.<eos> Does it float?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, of course.<eos> - How many will it take? - Us.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Lincoln's Inn.<eos> Lincoln's Inn.<eos> What the hell for?<eos> There is a hand-written note on my desk in the attic.<eos> I need you to deliver it to the secretary of His Majesty the King.
"In the event of my death, all of my possessions and landholdings will be bequeathed..."<eos> In severalty and in perpetuity to the sovereign nation of the United States of America.<eos> So, now we know, the savage boy is cunning too.<eos> And when peace comes and this border is drawn, it will not be by soldiers but by more fucking lawyers... hundreds of them, from both sides.<eos> And every scratch and claim staked will be cited as legal precedent.<eos> And not only can we not resolve this disaster by killing Delaney, it is now in our urgent interest to keep the bastard alive.<eos> Get four nails and a wooden board and a man called Solomon Coop into this room by tomorrow at noon.<eos> Can you manage that?<eos> By midday, Mr. Pettifer.<eos> I do what I can with the rotten dock trash Atticus brings, so the least you can do is sit before you refuse it.
By midday, Mr. Pettifer.<eos> I do what I can with the rotten dock trash Atticus brings, so the least you can do is sit before you refuse it.<eos> And if that sickly youth on the doorstep is there to protect you from East India assassins, know that by 2:00 AM he's easily distracted by whores.<eos> Well, you needn't worry about the East India Company.<eos> No need to worry about the Crown... any longer.<eos> For now I'm only in danger from the Americans but I reasoned that they are the lesser of the three adversaries, wouldn't you agree?<eos> I've been searching every fucking room in this house but not the cellar, so I must beat the tide.<eos> I must beat the tide.<eos> Hello?<eos> Winter, what are you doing here?

Did she make it?<eos> What mark?<eos> In the later days she did things... no-one understood.<eos> In the later days, when she wasn't allowed to walk the streets, nor show her face in public, nor speak in English, nor her savage tongue because she was a mad woman.<eos> - James.<eos> - No.<eos> Explain this.<eos> I have the very same mark on me... from when I was taken prisoner in Africa.<eos> What is it?<eos> You tell me.

Always, Sir, on account of her being a fussy, stuck up bitch, Sir.<eos> I am here on behalf of His Majesty the King.<eos> Give it to Miss Bow and only Miss Bow... on pain of execution.<eos> You bad, bad man.<eos> - Keep doing that.<eos> - Tickle, tickle!<eos> Spoken for, Sir.<eos> Dear, God.<eos> Spoken for, Sir.<eos> You haven't changed a bit, Godders.
Spoken for, Sir.<eos> Dear, God.<eos> Spoken for, Sir.<eos> You haven't changed a bit, Godders.<eos> I need to speak to you.<eos> Your secret won't remain a secret for very long in the East India Company.<eos> - Blackmail?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But between friends, so where's the harm?<eos> Now, you take the minutes, don't you, of every meeting and you also hear everything they say when they raise their hand?

I'll pay you a pound every month.<eos> How did you know about me?<eos> Because I have eyes and ears everywhere throughout the city in many places, much like the Company itself.<eos> I honestly mean you no harm, Godders.<eos> - If I were caught...<eos> - What?<eos> If I were caught passing company secrets to a Delaney...<eos> You're not going to get caught because I will protect you.<eos> You know, at the seminary, I was in love with you.<eos> Of course you do.
If I were caught passing company secrets to a Delaney...<eos> You're not going to get caught because I will protect you.<eos> You know, at the seminary, I was in love with you.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> Of course.<eos> And there was I thinking that we were just brothers in arms.<eos> Didn't we share a bed sometimes in the great hall?<eos> It was torture.<eos> Exquisite.<eos> So you can trust me... and I will protect you.
Dear, Sister... I am restoring our father's offices<eos> I have registered the Delaney Trading Company with Lloyds of London and I will ready my ship so that when the time is right and the Company has fallen we can leave.<eos> I am accruing a band of loyal servants, none of whom have any value to me beyond the facilitation of this greater good.<eos> When I left England, I was just a boy.<eos> Now I am back, much has changed.<eos> Your leaving England was the click of the hypnotist's fingers.<eos> I woke from a trance and realised the depth of our sin.<eos> I have found forgiveness in God and in my husband, and I want no part in your plans or your future.<eos> But we are the future.<eos> Your husband is already passed and you can see that by the way that he follows you.

And she likes it.<eos> Since you came back, our fucking has become almost murderous.<eos> It exhausts us.<eos> To think I have this wicked... wicked thing beneath me and it's my lifelong duty to punish her.<eos> It exhausts us both.<eos> A beautiful exhaustion.<eos> And in the morning I read the Gazette and she eats her toast... like a sweet little bird.<eos> I didn't come to sell you insurance, Mr. Delaney.<eos> I came to thank you.<eos> You summoned me.

There will be a performance or there will be a riot in Covent Garden.<eos> Until the necessary arrangements have been made, I advise that you go absolutely nowhere.<eos> As of now, you are a weakness.<eos> These fantasies elude me...<eos> If you go outside, they will find you and they will find a use for you.<eos> I am seldom used.<eos> There is no "they" and there will be a performance.<eos> Are you armed?<eos> Get me a carriage to Drury Lane, would you?<eos> You have to get that woman out of this house or I swear I will kill her and her bloody canary.
You have to get that woman out of this house or I swear I will kill her and her bloody canary.<eos> Brace... get two carriages.<eos> I see that you're bleeding again.<eos> I saw blood.<eos> How?<eos> Where?<eos> You searching the laundry?<eos> It is equally my business.<eos> It seems that jointly we are unable to stop the moon from rising.<eos> Could you fetch some oranges?
I saw blood.<eos> How?<eos> Where?<eos> You searching the laundry?<eos> It is equally my business.<eos> It seems that jointly we are unable to stop the moon from rising.<eos> Could you fetch some oranges?<eos> I would like some oranges.<eos> Is it the goose or the gander who has bad sauce?<eos> Do you know we can't even afford new china?
Could you fetch some oranges?<eos> I would like some oranges.<eos> Is it the goose or the gander who has bad sauce?<eos> Do you know we can't even afford new china?<eos> So that's your reason for not taking.<eos> The dock boys I pay in pennies have litters of children.<eos> I just get blood.<eos> My dearest Zilpha...<eos> I apologise... that I am not related to you.<eos> But you could allow your cunt to swallow the work of an honest man, who will promise to buy you the finest china... if you just agree to stop fucking bleeding.
- She doesn't want fucking oranges!<eos> We all know what she wants.<eos> How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?<eos> Very vilely in the morning when he's sober and most vilely in the afternoon when he's drunk.<eos> When he's best he's little worse than a man, and when he's worst he's little better than a beast.<eos> - Hurry up!<eos> - Vestris!<eos> Vestris!<eos> Hey!<eos> If you're here just for a wank, pull your pudding and get it over with and let the rest of us enjoy Shakespeare!
I'm not a courtesan.<eos> But we are here and there is a room with a bed and fire.<eos> Now this gentleman is a Duke.<eos> He asked for you particularly and he was told by your theatre manager you would comply.<eos> He will pay to be in the room with us while we play.<eos> - Then you were given the wrong name.<eos> - There she is.<eos> Give her to me.<eos> Very well.<eos> Your manager sold me the costume you wore when you played The Little Princess.
Miriam.<eos> Go away, Richard!<eos> Hey, hey, I just want to talk to you.<eos> I already told the police it was you who ran over the little boy.<eos> - You already told the police?
Go away, Richard!<eos> Hey, hey, I just want to talk to you.<eos> I already told the police it was you who ran over the little boy.<eos> - You already told the police?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Stay away, Richard!<eos> Tell anybody else?<eos> No.<eos> But I don't know why you're not arrested, so I also wrote a letter.<eos> What do you mean, a letter?
Come here!<eos> Come here!<eos> Come here!<eos> Shut up!<eos> - Chad.<eos> - What's up?<eos> Listen, that little bitch Miriam sent a letter to the sheriff today.<eos> You got to intercept that motherfucker.<eos> Oh, that ain't gonna be real easy, Richard.<eos> What a pussy you are!

I'll try.
What a pussy you are!<eos> Don't let that fucking letter get to the sheriff, you chickenshit, or I'll fuck you up bad.<eos> You're asking a lot there, pal. I'll try.<eos> You do more than try, fuck face.<eos> I'm taking off.<eos> Fuck!<eos> I will throw all of this shit out the window.<eos> Quit fucking speaking to me, and what I do or don't fucking do doesn't concern you.<eos> It's a fucking nightmare.<eos> I don't tell you shit like why the fuck you don't ask for a raise.

How much money do you make, anyways?<eos> You barely make minimum wage!<eos> We can't even afford this shit hole.<eos> I don't tell you to clean this fucking place up!<eos> - Don't you fucking move. - Ah!<eos> Don't you fucking...<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Don't you give me that fucking innocent look.<eos> I know exactly what you did.
- Candie!<eos> What happened?<eos> What happened?<eos> I'm so sorry! I'm sorry!<eos> Jesus!<eos> Rodney, let me see that.<eos> - It's all right!<eos> - Let me see this.<eos> Candie!<eos> What the fuck did you do, Candie?
Candie!<eos> Candie!<eos> Candie, let...<eos> Dougie, have a seat.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll, uh, examine you standing up.<eos> Anyway, as I told you, Dr. Ben, it started last week when Dougie disappeared for three days.<eos> He missed Sonny Jim's birthday party, which we'd been planning for six months, and then he shows up straight from the casino.<eos> You know about his gambling problems and then the drinking, and the drinking feeds the gambling and vice versa, and the whole thing is just a downward spiral.<eos> Dougie, have you been exercising?

We were having a regular conversation about his money and insurance and-and...<eos> No, Dougie, don't do that.<eos> And we were just walking along, minding our own business, and I held on to him, and then, out of nowhere, someone came right at us, pointing a gun at my husband, and we were just... Dougie!<eos> He wa... he started...<eos> The gun went off, and it scared me, and my Dougie, he gave him a good old karate chop in the throat, and I punched him a couple times.<eos> I said, "Don't you touch... Just get off him!"<eos> Get off him!" And then we... he ran off!<eos> I don't know where he went, and it was... it was just...<eos> Freeze it there.<eos> You just took care of business, right, Doug...

And then they'll bloat like a big red fucking balloon.<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop distracting yourself with all this diverting bullshit, and pay attention.<eos> Save the children!<eos> Every parent wants to save their child.<eos> Buy yourself a shovel, dig yourself out of the shit, and get educated!<eos> Oh, he's so beautiful.<eos> Sonny Jim, go get in the car.<eos> I can't stop thinking about last night.<eos> You're so wonderful.
Oh, he's so beautiful.<eos> Sonny Jim, go get in the car.<eos> I can't stop thinking about last night.<eos> You're so wonderful.<eos> - Wonderful. - Mm.<eos> I just had to tell you that.<eos> Okay.

Now I know...<eos> how Brando felt.<eos> Calling him tomorrow, this Douglas Jones to set up a meeting.<eos> Right you are, Rodney.<eos> - Right you are.<eos> - He took us... for 30 million... 447 thousand... dollars.<eos> Motherfucker.<eos> You fuck us once, shame on us.<eos> You fuck us twice, shame on you.<eos> You're dead.
This was just found on one of the earliest cards.<eos> Dale!<eos> This is something.<eos> This is really something.<eos> What did he do?<eos> He came in and attacked us and stole all my money!<eos> Oh, damn it.<eos> Is Johnny okay?<eos> No concerns for me, as usual.<eos> What do you mean, Johnny?

The Truman brothers are both true men.<eos> They are your brothers.<eos> And the others, the good ones who have been with you.<eos> Now the circle is almost complete.<eos> Watch and listen to the dream of time and space.<eos> It all comes out now, flowing like a river.<eos> That which is and is not.<eos> Hawk.<eos> Laura is the one.<eos> You know the one.
Oh, carl.<eos> I know there's been trouble in that trailer.<eos> We've all heard it.<eos> And I feel for you and your girl, okay, shelly?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Shelly.<eos> Norma, becky took off.<eos> I don't know where she went.<eos> What should I do?<eos> Why didn't you just call bobby?

I want out.<eos> You want a divorce?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I love him.<eos> You're gonna have to pay for the door And the damage to the apartment.<eos> I'm not paying for her apartment.<eos> Becky.<eos> I'm not going to do it.<eos> I don't have any money, anyway!<eos> Honey, If I didn't work for the sheriff, You'd be in jail right now.

Cat on a hot tin roof.<eos> It's never done that before.<eos> We're supposed to get some coffee, But I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> Coffee?<eos> I would like some coffee.<eos> Maybe some warm milk.<eos> For the cat.<eos> On the roof?<eos> Yes.<eos> The picture you took of ruth.
Sit down, dougie.<eos> Just close the door behind you When you go, phil.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Dougie, Now that I've had time to think about this, It's clear that your investigative work<eos> The recent two attempts on your life, The blowing up your car, the man trying to shoot you, Absolutely confirm this.<eos> Also, thanks to you, we now know that The mitchum brothers' case was not arson But a legitimate claim for an accidental fire,<eos> Which indicates to me that the mitchum brothers, Although alleged gangsters, Are not part of this conspiracy,<eos> Which suggests that the shots are being called By somebody else.<eos> Somebody else.<eos> I think you're right, dougie.

I know.

Listen to me.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> There's something in that box.<eos> And if that something is what I saw in my dream, We can't kill him.<eos> What the fuck are you talking...<eos> No, I'm not kidding, rodney.<eos> If he's got this one certain thing That's in that box, It means we can't kill him.<eos> Why?<eos> It means he's not our enemy, rodney.<eos> How the fuck can you know that?

You gotta promise me.

The Blue Rose.<eos> The Blue Rose.<eos> Diane's on her way.<eos> Have a seat, Diane.<eos> Care for a drink?<eos> I like it on the rocks.<eos> Well, you're in luck.<eos> The Dakotas are still in the Ice Age.<eos> Diane, we know your work with Agent Cooper has given you more than a passing insight into the Blue Rose.<eos> Even though you're no longer a part of the bureau, we'd like to deputize you.
Get the car key.<eos> Get the car...<eos> Get the goddamn car key!<eos> What?<eos> I know where she lives.<eos> I can d-deliver them.<eos> I guess.<eos> Kriscol.<eos> I want to ask you something.<eos> You been selling your blood again?

No, sir.<eos> Okay, Kriscol.<eos> Here's 50 bucks for the work.<eos> Plus don't pay me for any rent this month.<eos> - What? - Rent is due soon.<eos> Don't pay it this month.<eos> And the next time you're thinking about selling your blood, come talk to me about it.<eos> I don't like it.<eos> I don't like people selling their blood to eat.<eos> It's true the hospital medical people need people to donate blood, but you've given enough already.
I don't like people selling their blood to eat.<eos> It's true the hospital medical people need people to donate blood, but you've given enough already.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Keep your blood, Kriscol.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Hello, Sarah.<eos> Hawk.<eos> Been meaning to stop by.<eos> Some old cases popped up, and I thought about you.<eos> That's very kind of you, but I suppose you're really here because of what happened in the grocery store.
Help of any kind.<eos> Thanks, Hawk.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> - Excuse me. - Hmm?<eos> Sheriff Truman is here.<eos> Yeah, please, have him come in.<eos> Frank.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> How are you?
Your grandson Richard was the one who ran over and killed that little boy.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Richard.<eos> And it looks like he tried to kill the only witness who saw him do it.<eos> Miriam Sullivan.<eos> Nursery school teacher.<eos> She's in intensive care.<eos> No insurance.<eos> Desperately needs an operation.<eos> I was hoping that you could...
Richard assaulted her.<eos> She needs an operation.<eos> Beverly, please take care of this right away. Yeah, of course.<eos> I'll do it right now.<eos> I loved that bike.<eos> I loved that bike that my father got for me.<eos> The trap was set.<eos> They waited till after midnight, and then, 75 strong, they came up over the mountain, sirens wailing, guns drawn...<eos> Albert.<eos> Gordon, would you please ask your friend to wait downstairs?

Sweetheart, would you excuse us for a moment?<eos> I'll call you in the bar.<eos> It's a good one.<eos> Call you at the bar.<eos> She's here visiting a friend of her mother whose daughter has gone missing.<eos> The mother owns a turnip farm.<eos> I told her to tell the mother that her daughter will turn up eventually.<eos> She didn't get it either.<eos> Being French, it doesn't translate.<eos> Do you realize, Albert, that there are more than 6,000 languages spoken on Earth today?
These giant multinational corporations are filled with monstrous vermin, poisonous, vile murderers, and they eat, drink, and shit money.<eos> They buy our politicians for a song.<eos> Then these fucking politicians sing as we gag and cough, sold down the river to die.<eos> Fuck you who betray the people you were elected to help, elected to work to help to make life better for.<eos> Fuck you all in the ass, you fucking treasonous puppets!<eos> The ninth level of hell will welcome you.<eos> Okay, I'm tired of waiting for the phone to ring.<eos> I'm going to the Roadhouse.<eos> I know he couldn't stand that place, but we've checked everywhere else.<eos> Are you coming with me?
I'm going to the Roadhouse.<eos> I know he couldn't stand that place, but we've checked everywhere else.<eos> Are you coming with me?<eos> Audrey, look at this paperwork I have, and I've got a deadline.<eos> Look, stacks of it.<eos> How can I leave this and go out so late at night?<eos> I want to find Billy same as you, but... can't we start out in the light of day?<eos> It's a new moon tonight. It'll be dark out there.<eos> Stay here and get a good sleep, and we'll both go looking tomorrow.<eos> What kind of shit are you?

I got to thank you every hour on the hour, get on my knees and adore you?<eos> Audrey, I don't like the tone of your voice.<eos> Look, Charlie, let's just call a spade a spade.<eos> You have no balls.<eos> That's why I'm in love with Billy.<eos> That's why I am fucking Billy.<eos> Audrey. I saw Billy in my dream last night, and he was bleeding from the nose and mouth.<eos> And dreams sometimes hearken a truth.<eos> Now, I got to go, Charlie.<eos> I asked for your company, your protection, but you're such a milquetoast, the only protection would be me protecting you.
Those papers... there's something fishy about them.<eos> I'm not signing anything until I run them by my lawyer.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> Maybe I should run them by Paul.<eos> Maybe I should have Paul come give you a visit.<eos> Don't, Audrey.<eos> Don't be like this.<eos> I'm your lawfully wedded husband.<eos> I have rights.<eos> You gave up those rights.
Oh, I see.<eos> Maybe I should run them by Paul.<eos> Maybe I should have Paul come give you a visit.<eos> Don't, Audrey.<eos> Don't be like this.<eos> I'm your lawfully wedded husband.<eos> I have rights.<eos> You gave up those rights.<eos> What?<eos> You mean you'd go back on our contract?
Okay, Audrey.<eos> I'll go with you.<eos> I'm so sleepy, but I'll go.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> We're going to the Roadhouse.<eos> I told you.<eos> Oh, Audrey.<eos> I'll go, then.<eos> I'll need my jacket.<eos> I see you've already got yours.
We're going to the Roadhouse.<eos> I told you.<eos> Oh, Audrey.<eos> I'll go, then.<eos> I'll need my jacket.<eos> I see you've already got yours.<eos> Uh, yeah, what the fuck do you think? I told you we were going out.<eos> Obviously I'll need my jacket.<eos> There's thousands of square miles of woods out there, Audrey.<eos> Do you think we're just gonna walk out the door or waltz into the Roadhouse and presto, there he'll be?
Tina.<eos> Let me call her now, okay?<eos> I know, I'll tell her I'm alone, but... let's see if she knows anything.<eos> If her husband's there, she won't be able to talk, but... let's see.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay, call the bitch. See what she knows.<eos> Supposedly she was the last one to see Billy, but I think Chuck is certifiable, so we can't count on shit from him.<eos> Chuck told you Tina was the last person to see Billy?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you know that Chuck stole Billy's truck last week?

I'm so tired, Audrey.<eos> Hello?<eos> Yes, Tina. It's Charlie.<eos> How are you?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Sorry to call so late.<eos> I wanted to ask you something.<eos> Okay?<eos> Yeah, so Chuck told me you might have been the last person to see Billy.
Is this true?<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, I know that.<eos> You're sure?<eos> But...<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, Tina.<eos> Okay.<eos> How did you find... What?
Okay.<eos> How did you find... What?<eos> Really?<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> Thank you, Tina.<eos> Great.<eos> I'll talk to you soon.<eos> I'll try tomorrow.<eos> Yeah, again, sorry to call so late.<eos> Unbelievable, what you're telling me.
I'll talk to you soon.<eos> I'll try tomorrow.<eos> Yeah, again, sorry to call so late.<eos> Unbelievable, what you're telling me.<eos> I won't.<eos> Come...<eos> I promise.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> Bye.<eos> You're not gonna tell me what she said?
I haven't got a clue.<eos> She was supposed to show last night.<eos> She didn't show then either.<eos> She might be with Clark.<eos> Clark?<eos> Yeah.<eos> They've been hanging out lately.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You look surprised.
Come in!<eos> - How you doing? Our new favorite insurance agency!<eos> Oh, my, God, Battling Bud, you're the man!<eos> Looks like you boys made quite a night of it.<eos> Dougie, you might want to call your wife.
You ready?<eos> Ready.<eos> Look at him. Yeah, he's ready.<eos> He's not ready.<eos> Commence arm wrestle!<eos> Ain't touching yet!<eos> Take him out! Take him down!<eos> Starting positions.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Come on, boss. - Boss, what are you doing?
Come on, stop playing around, boss.<eos> - Don't play around, boss.<eos> - Come on, finish him.<eos> Come on, do it!<eos> Starting position's more comfortable.<eos> Come on, man!<eos> Don't you fucking move, Ray!<eos> - Oh, come on. - Come on, boss.<eos> Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back.<eos> It hurt my arm when you moved it down here.
Somebody hired you to kill me.<eos> Who is it?<eos> I can make you tell me.<eos> I know it.<eos> It came through a man named Phillip Jeffries.<eos> At least that's the name he gives.<eos> I never met him.<eos> I only talked to him on the phone.<eos> He set the whole prison thing up with Warden Murphy.<eos> Jeffries says you were gonna kill me.
At least that's the name he gives.<eos> I never met him.<eos> I only talked to him on the phone.<eos> He set the whole prison thing up with Warden Murphy.<eos> Jeffries says you were gonna kill me.<eos> He said I could get out and stay out if I killed you first.<eos> He said that you got something inside that they want.<eos> Did he ever mention Major Briggs?<eos> No. Easy, Ray.<eos> You know I don't have a gun.
You know I don't have a gun.<eos> I got to show you something.<eos> Jeffries said I was supposed to put this on you... after I killed you.<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> It was given to me... right before I walked out of my cell and saw you.<eos> A guard.<eos> I don't know.<eos> He was dressed as a guard, but I'd never seen him before.<eos> Put it on... ring finger, left hand.<eos> Now... you know what I want, Ray.

Can I reach in my pocket?<eos> The numbers, stupid.<eos> I have the coordinates written out.<eos> They're in my pocket.<eos> Here...<eos> Ray, where is Phillip Jeffries?<eos> Ray, where's Phillip Jeffries?<eos> Last I heard, he was at a place called The Dutchman's, but it's not a real place.<eos> I know what it is.<eos> You went too far.
Better be good.<eos> It is.<eos> I need to know a good poison I could use...<eos> You shit.<eos> What?<eos> Aconitine.<eos> Crime labs are getting wise to it, but it's your best bet.<eos> Where do I get it?<eos> By paying me top fucking dollar, cowboy.<eos> Why are you so against me?

Yeah, but when they do get married, I heard they... they can marry, like, six or ten women.<eos> Funny there's not more of them.<eos> Oh, Dougie.<eos> Good morning, Dougie.<eos> What do you say to a nice hot cup of coffee?<eos> Coffee.<eos> It's on me.<eos> Coffee for the great Dougie Jones. Dougie Jones.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Hon, you want some cherry pie?
I can't believe what I was about to do.<eos> I have to confess.<eos> I will, Dougie.<eos> Bushnell...<eos> I've been selling you down the river for months and months for Duncan Todd. I've been working for Todd. I...<eos> I've lied and cheated for money.<eos> Anthony...<eos> Dougie already showed me.<eos> He explained all this already.<eos> He did? Now that you're confessing, I have to admit that my anger, my contempt for you is subsiding.

Now that you're confessing, I have to admit that my anger, my contempt for you is subsiding.<eos> Dougie even implicated himself.<eos> And he showed me how you manipulated claims, and you cost me plenty.
And he showed me how you manipulated claims, and you cost me plenty.<eos> I trusted you, Anthony.<eos> I looked at you as my friend and my number-one sales agent.<eos> Number-one sales agent.<eos> How can I make it up to you?<eos> I'm so ashamed of what I've done.<eos> And if it weren't for Dougie, I might have a murder on my hands.<eos> Oh, my God, what can I do?<eos> I was prepared to send you away for a long, long time.<eos> Oh. But now... are you prepared to testify against Duncan Todd?
And that's a huge milestone for such a new brand, particularly when this whole region still faces such uphill challenges economically.<eos> So that's good?<eos> That's very good.<eos> Curiously, one of the two that's lagging is this one right here... Your flagship diner.<eos> Well, business always takes a little dip this time of year.<eos> It's been going on for a few months now.<eos> So I took the liberty of running a point-of-sale analysis between this location and the others.<eos> I-I can't really decipher that.<eos> Could you just tell me what it means?<eos> In black and white, you're spending too much per pie and not charging enough.
In black and white, you're spending too much per pie and not charging enough.<eos> Well, look, Walter, I wanted to say this to you before.<eos> It's... I-I've heard from other people that they think that our pies at the other locations are just not as good as the ones we have here.<eos> I hear you.<eos> And I gave them all my exact recipes, as per our agreement, but I don't think they're following them.<eos> Norma, I assure you they're following your recipes to the letter, but also... per the agreement...<eos> Using their discretion about where they get the ingredients.<eos> Mm, no.<eos> All my ingredients are natural, organic, local. I know.<eos> You make them with love.

This is my tribute to you, Dr. Amp.<eos> Thanks to you, I am really starting to shovel myself out of the shit!<eos> Oh, Nadine.<eos> That... that just means the world to me.<eos> It really does.<eos> You... you know, it's... It's us against them.<eos> And I am your most loyal foot soldier... or... shoveler.<eos> You know, the... last... last time I saw you, it was about seven years ago.<eos> - You... - Mm.<eos> You were down on your hands and knees, looking for a potato.
This is Existentialism 101.<eos> Oh, fuck you!<eos> I'm serious!<eos> Who am I supposed to trust but myself?<eos> And I don't even know who I am!<eos> So what the fuck am I supposed to do?<eos> You're supposed to go to the Roadhouse and see if Billy is there.<eos> I guess.<eos> Is it far?<eos> Come on, Audrey, you know where it is.

Is it far?<eos> Come on, Audrey, you know where it is.<eos> If I didn't know better, I would swear you were on drugs.<eos> Just where is it?<eos> I'm gonna take you there.<eos> Now, are you gonna stop playing games, or do I have to end your story, too?<eos> What story is that, Charlie?<eos> Is that the story of the little girl who lived down the lane?<eos> Is it?<eos> You're the one that wanted to go.

Which will it be, Charlie?<eos> Which one would you be?
Twin Peaks Sheriff's Station.<eos> Is that you, Lucy?<eos> Director Cole.<eos> You've been there all through the years, Lucy?
The other holds a gun, which she drops as she backs away when they enter.<eos> They recognize the wounded woman as Lois Duffy.<eos> She speaks her last words to them:<eos> "I'm like the blue rose."<eos> She smiles, then dies, then disappears before their eyes.<eos> The other woman screaming in the corner, they now notice is also Lois Duffy.<eos> By the way, Lois Duffy did not have a twin sister.<eos> Then while awaiting trial for a murder she swore she didn't commit, this Lois hangs herself.<eos> Those two arresting officers were Gordon Cole and Phillip Jeffries.<eos> Now, what's the one question you should ask me?
What's the word? A tulpa.<eos> Good.<eos> Coffee time.<eos> Albert, think I've got it.<eos> And Diane's on her way.<eos> Come on in, Diane.<eos> Make yourself at home.<eos> Enjoy some coffee.<eos> Deputy Diane reporting.<eos> Diane, that last night you saw Cooper... did he, by any chance, mention Major Garland Briggs?
Enjoy some coffee.<eos> Deputy Diane reporting.<eos> Diane, that last night you saw Cooper... did he, by any chance, mention Major Garland Briggs?<eos> I don't want to talk about that night.<eos> I understand.<eos> All I want to know is, did he mention Major Briggs?<eos> Fuck you, Gordon.<eos> Yes.<eos> Albert.<eos> Diane, as you know, we've been investigating an old case of Cooper's involving Major Briggs.
Turns out he died a few days ago here in Buckhorn, and... we found this in his stomach.<eos> The ring was inscribed:<eos> "To Dougie with love,<eos> Janey-E."<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> My sister's name is Jane, my half sister.<eos> But everybody calls him Dougie.<eos> And her nickname's Janey-E.<eos> Where do they live? LastI heard,LasVegas.<eos> When did you last speak with her?
I saw myself.<eos> I saw myself from long ago, in the old Philadelphia offices, listening to Cooper telling me he was worried about a dream he had.<eos> Gordon, it's 10:10 a.m. on February 16th.<eos> I was worried about today because of the dream I told you about.<eos> And that was the day Phillip Jeffries appeared...<eos> Gordon!<eos> Phillip?<eos> Phillip?<eos> Cooper, meet the long-lost Phillip Jeffries.<eos> You may have heard of him from the academy.
Hey. All right.<eos> Turkey and cheese.<eos> Ham and cheese.<eos> Roast beef and cheese.<eos> And just cheese.<eos> Who ordered just cheese?<eos> Idid.<eos> It's all old business, Chad, from long before your time.<eos> Up the mountain.<eos> And you are under arrest, Chad.
Idid.<eos> It's all old business, Chad, from long before your time.<eos> Up the mountain.<eos> And you are under arrest, Chad.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> What's this all about?<eos> I think you know.<eos> Andy, Bobby, take him downstairs.<eos> You're making a big mistake!<eos> You made the mistake, Chad.
We need to put her in a cell where she'll be safe.<eos> Okay.<eos> Don't tell anybody about this.<eos> What happened to us back there?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But I don't remember a thing.<eos> I hope these pajamas are okay.<eos> They've been in my locker since the time that dog got lost in here.<eos> They're beautiful, Lucy.<eos> Do you remember that night, Andy?

What'd you want me to do with the crates?<eos> Just leave them.<eos> I'll throw the linens on them in the morning.<eos> It's easier for them that way.<eos> There you go.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Okay, Jimmy.<eos> We got one more delivery, and then it's hit the Roadhouse.<eos> Who's playing?<eos> Don't know. You want to see if Renee will be there.
But she's married.<eos> I know.<eos> How old are you, Freddie?<eos> Going on 23.<eos> I remember being 23.<eos> It's my birthday today.<eos> Isthatright?<eos> Well, happy birthday, Jimmy.<eos> This is a real occasion.<eos> So you really can't take that thing off, huh?
This is a real occasion.<eos> So you really can't take that thing off, huh?<eos> Nah, I can't.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> It's, uh, part of me.<eos> Doctor tried to take it off once, and... I started bleeding.<eos> Where'd you get it?<eos> I'm, uh, not supposed to tell.<eos> It's my birthday, Freddie.<eos> You gotta tell me.
Nah, I can't.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> It's, uh, part of me.<eos> Doctor tried to take it off once, and... I started bleeding.<eos> Where'd you get it?<eos> I'm, uh, not supposed to tell.<eos> It's my birthday, Freddie.<eos> You gotta tell me.<eos> Come on, I'm not gonna tell anybody.<eos> Eh, you ain't gonna believe me anyway.
Hanging about, hitting the pub every night, drinking, when I should be helping people.<eos> With this feeling in me on this particular night,<eos> I see in the alleyway a high stack of boxes, and I jumped, you know, like, for fun.<eos> I jumped onto this high stack of boxes. And all of a sudden,<eos> I was sucked up into the vortex of this massive tunnel in the air.<eos> Next thing you know,<eos> I'm floating in thin air, way up somewhere, like a void.<eos> The Fireman's what he's called himself.<eos> And he says to me, "Go to the hardware store near your flat.<eos> And there you will find a rack of green rubber gardening gloves.
Well, Jobsworth leaps after me like a possessed puma, screaming that I can't have the glove from the package which has already been opened.<eos> I bolt out the door, hit the cobbles, hoping to leave Mr. Jobsworth in the dust, slipping the glove on while I go.<eos> Then he slows me down a mite. And before you know it, Jobsworth puts a tackle on me worthy of a red card and sends me skidding on the field.<eos> On instinct, to defend myself,<eos> I hear a crack, and... by the way his head's tilting and him trying to talk...<eos> I fear I've snapped his Gregory.<eos> And then, in that moment,<eos> I remember something else that bloke up in the sky told me. "Once you've got the glove on, go to Twin Peaks, Washington,<eos> United States of America.<eos> And there, you will find your destiny."
Thank you, Freddie. That's a great story.<eos> The pleasure's all mine, sir.<eos> Whyyou?<eos> I mean, why do you think the Fireman picked you?<eos> Well, that's a good question. I asked him myself, I said,<eos> "Why me?" And he said,<eos> "Why not you?" And when I went to buy me ticket to fly over here, they told me I already had a ticket.<eos> Don't forget.<eos> We're supposed to check the furnace.<eos> You wait for the delivery.
Thanks.<eos> You drinking all alone tonight?<eos> Mind your own business, please.<eos> That's not very polite.<eos> It wasn't meant to be polite.<eos> Would you sit back where you were, please? I'll sit wherever I want.<eos> It's a free country.<eos> It's a free country.<eos> It's a free cunt-ry.<eos> Maybe you're one of them bull dykes.
Damn.<eos> You have something to do with this?<eos> What?<eos> You-you saw me.<eos> Honey!<eos> Call 911!<eos> We got a dead one at the bar.<eos> We'll see about this.<eos> Yeah. Sure is a mystery, huh?<eos> That's because you're hanging out at the nuthouse.
Getting high in there. Bullshit.<eos> I'm not. I'm getting high in my room.<eos> Flying in my own room.<eos> Just don't go in that nut place.<eos> Fuck you. Who said I would anyway?<eos> Nice sweater.<eos> Where'd you lift that?<eos> It'sPaula's.<eos> It's nice.<eos> Have you seen Billy?

And he had this look in his eyes.<eos> Comes slamming in the back, stumbles in the kitchen.<eos> I start screaming, and I think my mom screamed too.<eos> And there was blood coming out his nose and mouth.<eos> And he goes and hangs his head in the sink.<eos> Blood's just gushing like a waterfall.<eos> And he turns and looks at us, real strange and all bloody.<eos> And then he bolts out the back again.<eos> We're like, "What?"<eos> And you didn't tell anyone?
- Can I talk to you?<eos> - It's not a good time.<eos> Addison, there's no record of you leaving sick yesterday.<eos> You're off the lineup for Saturday's meet.
- Can I talk to you?<eos> - It's not a good time.<eos> Addison, there's no record of you leaving sick yesterday.<eos> You're off the lineup for Saturday's meet.<eos> You sure you wanna do that?<eos> - Will you marry me?
- A Mona Vanderwaal?<eos> I hear her bags are going for $1000.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Good for her.<eos> I always knew she would make it.<eos> Hello, ladies.<eos> Hey, Lucas.<eos> Can it get any hotter?<eos> If it does, I'm shoving an ice pack down my panties.<eos> You know you can actually buy those.
That tingly feeling you get when you know A was watching you.<eos> What tingly feeling was that?<eos> I just can't believe we never figured out who it was.<eos> The other day, someone asked me how it felt to be living a normal life and I've never been more insulted.<eos> Why do we miss A so much?<eos> Because without fear, there can be no courage.<eos> - Who said that?<eos> - Christopher Paolini.<eos> I never would've guessed it was you.<eos> Are you here to kill me?
Are you here to kill me?<eos> Can we just take a second to appreciate this Robert Redford, Barbra Streisand.<eos> "The Way We Were" moment?<eos> Didn't they break up in that movie?<eos> Yeah, but in my head, the new wife dies and then they just get back together.<eos> - What?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> It's just, um...<eos> This is the best week ever.<eos> Our book might become a movie and you're about to become my wife.

- Good girl. I love you.<eos> - I love you too.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Alright.<eos> Okay, it's gonna be a fun day.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Thanks for coming so early.<eos> - Yeah, of course.<eos> She doesn't know you're here, right?

You're giving me peace of mind.<eos> Just knowing that Emily's gonna be taken care of.<eos> Like I promised you I will always be here for her.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, I was thinking about staying in town for a while.<eos> Really?<eos> That's great.<eos> I feel like we're just starting to get to know each other again.<eos> Me too.<eos> But I was hoping you'd consider swapping the barn for your old room?

Fine.<eos> You win.<eos> But just this once.<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Toby.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Hey.<eos> Ali said she talked to Jason.<eos> You weren't coming back for the wedding.
It's okay.<eos> Shh. It's okay.<eos> Um, hey, if you, give me a minute I can give you a lift back into town, if you want?<eos> What can I help you with?<eos> Can you throw that in the truck?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I saw it on eBay and I couldn't resist.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good boy.<eos> Orson Welles said that if you want a happy ending that depends, of course, on where you stop your story.
It's like when you finish a book and you don't want it to end.<eos> Even though the characters are happy you're still sad that it's ending.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Isn't your friend the reason the book doesn't have a happy ending?<eos> She stole Ezra from Nicole.<eos> They were hooking up while she was rotting away...<eos> That's enough, Addison.<eos> It's just my opinion.<eos> - Lesbo.<eos> - Excuse me, what did you say?

That was the last bell.<eos> Some of us can see... and hear.<eos> So go.<eos> Now.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> I may not be able to see but I can smell a bitch from a mile away.<eos> And I thought you used to be the mean girl.<eos> I'm sure she makes a kickass life skills teacher but she still creeps me out.<eos> We stayed in Rosewood for her and I supported that.<eos> You have spent countless nights visiting her and I supported that too.
It's just until she finishes therapy.<eos> And how long is that gonna be?<eos> It's Welby.<eos> They just dropped off Mona.<eos> - She's on her way up.<eos> - We were doing so well, Hanna.<eos> With your designs taking off and me selling my software to Lucas.<eos> We bought the loft.<eos> I'm gonna get ready for the party.<eos> You're not even going to say hello?
