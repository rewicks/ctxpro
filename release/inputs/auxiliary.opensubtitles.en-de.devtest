You want a little time to think?<eos> Think.<eos> Ponder things.<eos> You know, ruminate.<eos> You go ahead.<eos> A lot of stuff on your mind.<eos> You think things out.<eos> Think.<eos> Mull, just mull.<eos> Do a lot of mulling.
What are you two doing here?<eos> Scotty told me to do this.<eos> Oh, you were going to... do this?<eos> It's on the duty roster.<eos> Must have been...<eos> Isn't that a medical tricorder? Yes.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> I'm a doctor.<eos> Why do we need a doctor to repair a power relay?<eos> You don't... obviously.
It is disturbing... never knowing when that impulse may come, or whether or not you can control it when it does.<eos> You live on the edge of every moment and yet, in its own way, violence is attractive, too.<eos> Maybe because it doesn't require logic.<eos> Perhaps that's why it's so liberating.<eos> Ironic, isn't it... that I can share with you, of all people, what I have hidden from everyone all my life.<eos> Can we do it again, Tuvok? Again?<eos> Meld.<eos> That would not be advisable.<eos> I understand.<eos> Really, I do.
How long have you been alive?<eos> I have been in service 1,314,807 hours and 33 minutes.<eos> I was activated by a Builder from the Pralor homeworld.<eos> Tell me something more about these Builders.<eos> Were they anything like us?<eos> I have insufficient knowledge of your culture to provide an adequate response.<eos> Will you provide additional information?<eos> Well, I asked about your culture. Only fair you should ask about mine.<eos> Does your culture include artificial life-forms?<eos> As a matter of fact, it does.
I'II get you to Sick Bay. No.<eos> I have to give you the rest of it.<eos> You are Korenna.<eos> These are your memories. Yes.<eos> Why give them to me?<eos> You won't deny the truth.<eos> We've been hiding it.<eos> I couldn't anymore.<eos> They found out I was sharing it with you.<eos> Who did?
I'll probably just eat lunch.<eos> I'm going to the movies at the Texas Theatre.<eos> It's only 90 cents.<eos> I love the movies.<eos> I brought the curtain rods, Lee.<eos> I bought some just like this back in March.<eos> You did?<eos> Or AJ Hidell?<eos> Well, Mr Hunt, Fidel's defenders have to be careful.<eos> Yes, we do.
That's funny you should ask.<eos> You like me, Chris?<eos> Sure.<eos> Do you want to get to know me better?<eos> Are you drunk, Chris?<eos> Just a little.<eos> A little?<eos> I think I know what you need.<eos> You do, huh?<eos> Yes, I do.
Not on the ground or in the air.<eos> It's like the entire country has suddenly ceased to exist.<eos> I don't suppose you ever read science fiction, do you?<eos> Well, I was crazy about it as a kid.<eos> Yeah, until I was 18 or so.<eos> I've been sitting here running all these old stories through my head.<eos> You know, time warps, space warps, alien raiding parties.<eos> I mean, we really don't know if there's anything left down there, do we?<eos> Not with all this cloud cover.<eos> No, we don't.
All a nice pig like you need do is ask.<eos> Thanks very much.<eos> It was very kind of you.<eos> - A pleasure.<eos> - What a nice little pig!<eos> All right, how did you do it?<eos> I asked them, and they did it. I asked them nicely.<eos> We don't ask sheep, dear.<eos> We tell them what to do.<eos> I did, Mom.
Hi sweetheart!<eos> I'm missing you so much<eos> I miss you too, baby<eos> When are you coming back?<eos> It's been so long<eos> Is your work not over yet?<eos> Did you get the papers signed?<eos> Yes, I've got them signed, now there's no problem<eos> I'II be right there after diwali<eos> Now from where did this diwali spring between us?
- I think we should.<eos> - Then it's like some male fantasy.<eos> Meet a French girl on the train, fuck her and never see her again.<eos> And have this story to tell.<eos> I don't want to be a great story.<eos> I don't want this great evening to just have been for that.<eos> Okay, we don't have to have sex.<eos> It's not a big deal.<eos> You don't want to see me again?<eos> No, of course I do.
What are you doing here?<eos> Are you American?<eos> Yes.<eos> Aung San Suu Kyi!<eos> Aung San Suu Kyi!<eos> American?<eos> Are you American?<eos> Yes.<eos> American knows Aung San Suu Kyi?<eos> No, I don't.
How you doin'?<eos> - Let's involve the class.<eos> Quiet down, my special people.<eos> I want you all to meet... ..our new friend Billy.<eos> - Can everyone say hello to Billy?<eos> - Hello, Billy.<eos> Hi.<eos> Billy is going to be sharing our fun and learning for the next two weeks.<eos> Billy is special, just like each and every one of you.<eos> And what do we do to our special people?
You girls have a good time.<eos> See you later.<eos> Fuck me!<eos> Shit, I fell asleep!<eos> Bet my wife called the cops!<eos> I'II ride down with you.<eos> At 5AM?<eos> Duty knows no hours!<eos> I don't believe you!<eos> I really don't!
Down there?<eos> Served him right.<eos> He killed my dog.<eos> You knew he killed my sheepdog?<eos> That night it was raining hard...<eos> He came walking up the road... pissing blood.<eos> He fell down by my window, there,<eos> looking for help.<eos> I didn't move, I watched him die,<eos> like he did to my dog, my noble sheepdog.
I've never spoken of it.<eos> I don't know why I tell you now, except I see her strength in you.<eos> One day you'll be a queen.<eos> And you must open your eyes.<eos> You tell your King that William Wallace will not be ruled and nor will any Scot while I live.<eos> Ah!<eos> My son's loyal wife returns unkilled by the heathen.<eos> So he accepted our bribe?<eos> No.<eos> He did not.
Stay out of it, Robert!<eos> Aagh! Get away!<eos> Get away!<eos> The Bruce is not to be harmed, that's the arrangement.<eos> Father!<eos> You rotting bastard!<eos> Why?<eos> Why?<eos> Longshanks required Wallace.<eos> So did our nobles.
And that doesn't make you a bad person.<eos> He reminds me of Steve in a way.<eos> Steve's weak, immoral and a liar, but still a nice guy.<eos> He just shouldn't be married.<eos> At least not to me.<eos> I'm hungry. Are you getting hungry?<eos> I had no idea it's that bad, sis.<eos> Please, don't feel sorry for me.<eos> Nobody's forcing me to stay.<eos> Why do you?
Look, the man is ridiculous.<eos> He doesn't have one unique thought in his little, puny brain.<eos> I think that there's some merit in learning forms straight off.<eos> Josh, please.<eos> He's taken our minds at their most fecund point. -And restrained them before they've wandered through the garden of ideas.<eos> It's just like Hamlet said, "To thine own self be true."<eos> No, Hamlet didn't say that.<eos> I think that I remember Hamlet accurately.<eos> I remember Mel Gibson accurately and he didn't say that.<eos> That Polonius guy did.
You're just going with your feelings, but it can lead to other things.<eos> Like what?<eos> - Can lead to sex?<eos> Yeah, right. Can lead to sex.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> Why?<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> - I'm talking about you kissing Nadine. - I didn't kiss her.<eos> - You didn't?
I'd come to Toronto on a teaching exchange.<eos> We started talking and I had this feeling about him.<eos> The same for him.<eos> It wasn't exactly a thunderclap or a lightning bolt.<eos> It was more like a...<eos> Light drizzle?<eos> You honestly never had that feeling about anybody in your entire life?<eos> If I did, I would not admit it.<eos> His chin looks a little weak, if you ask me.<eos> It doesn't and I didn't.
T?<eos> Z?<eos> -Q.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -What are you doing here, Wade?<eos> -Banyan trees.<eos> I am not here.<eos> The CIA has no knowledge, no involvement.<eos> Nothing to do with your insertion into Cuba, if you catch my drift.<eos> Yes, I do.
Medioal examiner's oase number 3209.<eos> Maroh 1 6 1 995.<eos> Patrioe Jaointo.<eos> There are abrasions to the ohin.<eos> The abrasions are minimally haemorrhagio and red to purple in oolour.<eos> The neok wound is of a "y" oonfiguration - the horizontal line being five inohes long and half an inoh in width.<eos> We don't have a talking head any more.<eos> Somebody knew she was talking to us.<eos> I didn't know you knew the governor.<eos> I don't.
Unavoidable, sir.<eos> Unavoidable.<eos> Life doesn't mean much to some people anymore.<eos> You'd see that if you weren't always..<eos> - If I weren't what? Always at the Academy, sir. Oh!<eos> Don't you mean, at the Academy wiping cadets' asses?<eos> That's what they say in the squad room, isn't it?<eos> It's irrelevant.<eos> You set the standard, sir.<eos> Now you do... at least to many young cadets.
I'm going to be fine.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Memorizing me by heart?<eos> I already know you by heart.<eos> Goodbye princess.<eos> What was that noise last night?<eos> Somebody was crying for hours.<eos> That's nothing.<eos> You should hear Josephine snore.<eos> I do not!
What the fuck is wrong with you?<eos> - You took my Ice Cream records.<eos> - Ice Cube!<eos> They're sick!<eos> - Would you really shoot me?<eos> - Hell. no.<eos> You had that Alabama look.<eos> You're lucky I didn't have a fire hose.<eos> - You think this girl could be it?<eos> - Yeah. I do.
I want her back.<eos> That's going to take a lot of convincing.<eos> Do something for me. Just, um... organize a chance meeting.<eos> Bring her to a grocery store or a restaurant, and I'm there.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Ask Gail if I could baby-sit your kids Saturday.<eos> You want to baby-sit my kids?<eos> Yes! It's brilliant. It will convince Rebecca that I like children.<eos> That will get me in trouble with Gail, and you know how mad she gets.<eos> Marty, please do this for me!
Did you fight? - No, not at all.<eos> I told you, it's pure imagination.<eos> - You imagined that he'll leave you?<eos> Of course not.<eos> But you're still scared, he might jump off?<eos> No.<eos> Well, a bit.<eos> I love him.<eos> But does he love you aswell...<eos> He does, just as much.
Sir, I am ready to sing.<eos> hell's bells and buckets of blood!<eos> You're laughing at me!<eos> Mother?<eos> Go ahead and laugh!<eos> And grin!<eos> With your hideous face!<eos> What am I doing here in miserable Eschberg?<eos> Don'tyou know I couId have become the prelate of FeIdberg?<eos> No, you don't.
Easy.<eos> You!<eos> Me?<eos> Yes, you.<eos> Easy.<eos> Where is the Reverend's house?<eos> He's gone, because he's out of his mind.<eos> Oh!<eos> Butyour mother knows where he lives.<eos> No, she doesn't.
No kidding, we got his money.<eos> Fucking A, I like it.<eos> SARA:<eos> One thing.<eos> mills:<eos> Yes?<eos> You're probably not gonna believe this.<eos> We haven't found a fingerprint yet.<eos> -Um, not a single one.<eos> -You're right, I don't.
I don't really have time.<eos> Close the door.<eos> Sit in this chair.<eos> Now listen carefully.<eos> Your Aunt Em came by a couple of days ago.<eos> She was sick with worry. She was out of her mind.<eos> We had an interesting talk about you Thomas.<eos> You understand what I'm saying?<eos> Your Aunt Em thinks you're in trouble.<eos> And so do I.
- There'll be one!<eos> How can you tell?<eos> It gets dark...<eos> That's not thunder.<eos> I thought it was thunder.<eos> Praying?<eos> What makes you think that?<eos> My mother always prayed during a thunderstorm.<eos> - Why?<eos> - She did a lot of praying.
They didn't do it, of course. They didn't do any ofit.<eos> Like always, Mr. Big Shot sold his friends out.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> He goes on TV and gives this big news conference, tells the world... he just realized his dad's experiments are vital for humanity... and that the use of animals is absolutely necessary... that from now on, he,Jeffrey Goines, will personally supervise the labs... to make sure all the little animals aren't going to suffer.<eos> What is this?<eos> People like that aren't accessible.<eos> You can'tjust barge in on them. - It's not how theworld works.<eos> - Be quiet and drive the car.<eos> - I know what I'm doing.<eos> - No, you don't.
And you can't get past my encrypted program.<eos> You mean to tell me there's no way I can shut that off?<eos> No way.<eos> I never thought of that.<eos> It was Delta.<eos> We're locked on.<eos> Hold the ladder.<eos> And keep this chopper right here.<eos> I never doubted you.<eos> Oh, yes, you did.
Give me the shit.<eos> Give him the shit!<eos> Give him the fucking shit, man!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Come on!<eos> - Now the money.<eos> - There's no money.<eos> There's no fucking money.<eos> Give him the money.<eos> Do it!
Yes?<eos> - I bring gifts.<eos> - Ms. Winters, it's late.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just wanted to say that you were right and I was wrong. About the Corps.<eos> I can't go into details but in light of recent events I think we need to re-evaluate our relationship.<eos> Which is just a formal way of saying that I need someone to talk to, and strange as this sounds you're the only one I can think of.<eos> No. You don't offend me.<eos> But that does.
Oh, Chandler!<eos> Now!<eos> Now!<eos> That's it.<eos> There!<eos> Faster!<eos> Stop with the broom!<eos> We're not making noise!<eos> We won.<eos> We did it!
Please let me be happy.<eos> Go over there and tell that woman the truth.<eos> All right.<eos> Go.<eos> Hi.<eos> Listen, I have to, uh, ahem...<eos> I have to confess something.<eos> Yes?<eos> Whoever stood you up is a jerk.<eos> - How did you...
I'm dead.<eos> Well, you're gonna be even deader when Mom sees the mess in your room.<eos> This place is disgusting.<eos> I like it.<eos> You know, Brad, you got a big problem... but maybe we can help.<eos> How?<eos> Well, I can do your homework, and Mark here will clean your room.<eos> No, I won't.<eos> Mark, we're brothers.<eos> Brothers do things for each other.
I'm here to hire you.<eos> Face it, Joey. I've got more cash than all these low-rent crooks put together.<eos> Well, once Intergang is back, I'll control all of the action in town.<eos> - All of it.<eos> - Hey, hey.<eos> Okay?<eos> There's only one pooper at my party, Joey.<eos> Superman.<eos> I want him killed.<eos> Who doesn't?
You didn't hear about my story, did you?<eos> I'm afraid so.<eos> Well, there goes my surprise.<eos> Everyone, I'm Diana Stride and Top Copy is doing a tribute to Superman.<eos> We know he has a lot of great friends at the Planet and I'd like to interview all of you.<eos> I had hoped it would be a surprise for him, but...<eos> Well, there's no keeping secrets from the Man of Steel.<eos> So let's get started, shall we?<eos> Who wants to talk about Superman?<eos> - I do.
No, honey, this can't be foreplay.<eos> I'm enjoying it.<eos> And I'm in the room.<eos> I can't believe you guys.<eos> The whole point of this toys-for-guns exchange program is to give kids something else to play with besides firearms.<eos> For instance, I'm donating this oil-covered Alaskan seagull.<eos> Now, watch what happens when I pull the string.<eos> Kids, don't drink and drive an oil tanker.<eos> I smell fowl.<eos> You certainly do.
I know.<eos> Pretty rusty in my fathering, wouldn't you say?<eos> Well, who knows, maybe he found the right girl.<eos> The right girl?<eos> After one night?<eos> Well, I'll take that back.<eos> I was 17 myself once.<eos> And you survived.<eos> Amazing.<eos> But you did. We do.
The only people I've seen are Quark and Garak.<eos> Where's everybody else?<eos> There's something very wrong here.<eos> I'll say there is.<eos> Have you looked in the mirror lately?<eos> Hold on.<eos> Does anybody else hear that?<eos> - What?<eos> - l don't hear anything.<eos> - Garak didn't either.
I'm just being honest.<eos> Rom's a lot like his father.<eos> And you, I suppose, are a lot like me.<eos> I never knew you felt like that.<eos> Your father bought you your first copy of the Rules of Acquisition, but who helped you memorise them?<eos> You did.<eos> I don't think I've ever been prouder than the first time you made it through all 285 rules without a mistake.<eos> Rom knows them as well as I do.<eos> But you understand them.<eos> Rom never did.
- What are you talking about?<eos> - My friends are there.<eos> I know, but there's nothing you can do.<eos> - l have to try.<eos> - lt's too dangerous. You could get hurt.<eos> I can't watch that place burn, knowing my friends are inside.<eos> When things settle down, I'll talk to my friends in the police.<eos> By the time things settle down, my friends could be hurt or even killed.<eos> They don't belong in there.<eos> None of those people do.
Risian perfume.<eos> Our best guess is that the tetryon field reacted to the probe's shielding, producing a massive graviton wave.<eos> It wasn't your fault. It was my project, my theories.<eos> And you shouldn't forget that your project and your theories produced the first artificially created wormhole in history.<eos> It's a huge achievement.<eos> You're right. I am being a little self- indulgent, aren't I?<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Well, I guess I'll have a lot of work to do when I get back to Trill.<eos> Analyzing the telemetry from the probe alone will probably take months.<eos> Why not do the work here with me?
Do you have a minute, Captain? It's about Chakotay.<eos> That's not exactly my favorite subject right now, Lieutenant.<eos> Well, I thought that maybe I could explain...<eos> Explain what?<eos> Why my First Officer publicly defied my authority by commandeering a shuttle without permission?<eos> I know it was never his intention to defy you.<eos> He respects your authority.<eos> But...?<eos> But he's a very proud man, and he's been... embarrassed by Seska.<eos> What Seska did, she did to all of us.
I won't let you hurt her!<eos> Ralkana... he said you'd been shot.<eos> He was lying to you, Father.<eos> I'm all right.<eos> And your mother?<eos> She's fine.<eos> She was so happy to get your letters.<eos> She wanted me to tell you something.<eos> She forgives you.<eos> We both do.
It's yours.<eos> So Ahab mistakes the prophecy and, as a result, dies.<eos> - A similar fate happens to Macbeth.<eos> - Still, you're not the least bit curious?<eos> (knocking)<eos> That must be Mulder.<eos> Time for the midnight shift.<eos> All right.<eos> So how do I die?<eos> You don't_
It hurts.<eos> It hurts not to be wanted.<eos> I don't know why he hates me so.<eos> I've taken care of him for all of our lives.<eos> Maybe that is the reason why.<eos> How long can he survive outside of your body?<eos> Long enough to understand that you cannot change the way you were born.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> He'll come back.<eos> He always does.
- That's right, sir, I did.<eos> And the boy too.<eos> Come on, Killer.<eos> Come on, Killer Callahan!<eos> Get some!<eos> Get some!<eos> Come on, Killer! Do it!<eos> Fire at will!<eos> Come on, Killer.<eos> Do it!
This is a stimulant.<eos> You can't pump it full of drugs without knowing its body chemistry.<eos> So we should just let it die?<eos> Give me that.<eos> When I was a kid, a baby bird fell out of a nest and landed on the windowsill next to my bed.<eos> We had to feed it water with an eyedropper to keep it alive.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Filling the eyedropper.<eos> Can you hold its mouth open?<eos> Do it again. Again.
I'll be outside.<eos> Mind if I sit down?<eos> Look, I can't remember anything.<eos> I can imagine what I have done to you, but...<eos> I want you to know that whatever it is that I can do to help you, I will.<eos> This woman, Isabel...<eos> - Who is she?<eos> - She helped me out. - She doesn't know who you are? - No.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> But I do.
David, I can't say that line. It doesn't make sense.<eos> It's stupid. I don't get it.<eos> - It's just a stylish way of expressing a particular idea.<eos> - Idea? What idea?<eos> The agony of love. The difficulty of relating.<eos> - Why do you have to make it so hard to say?<eos> - Just say the line.<eos> - No, I can't say it. It's a mouthful of "ghibberish." - Gibberish!<eos> - I can't say it, and I will not say it.<eos> - Just do the line.
- Oh, no.<eos> Glen? Crazy Glen?<eos> What do you mean, he's here?<eos> What do I mean?<eos> He's here!<eos> He's in our den, watching a Spanish soap opera.<eos> How is he?<eos> How did he seem?<eos> He came in and asked me to make him a sandwich, no crust... then started making long distance calls.<eos> Oh, God. First, he did three scenes from Godfather II.
- Do they sound like his words?<eos> He can't be clear when clarity is what he wants to avoid.<eos> What he means is the gloves come off.<eos> I'm telling you, I had nothing to do with it.<eos> I didn't. I wish I had done it, they deserved it. But it wasn't me.<eos> Who did then?<eos> You know, you have no answers.<eos> Is this the way it was with Castro?<eos> - You don't want to hear an answer.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Moira, remember?<eos> Jacobs's secretary.<eos> I know Moira, honey.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> - She said he was a Latin Jack Ryan.<eos> - He was. - That's what she called him.<eos> - The point is, he's Latin.<eos> Which connects her death and Jacobs's beyond the fact that they worked together.<eos> You saw somebody you think is responsible for both killings? - Yes.<eos> She did.

Ryan, have you got a minute?<eos> No.<eos> We need to talk!<eos> Ryan!<eos> The Committee will come to order.<eos> The Chair will now call Dr Ryan.<eos> Dr Ryan, thank you for appearing before the Committee today. Thank you, Mr Chairman.<eos> Please stand and raise your right hand.<eos> Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
You stick your dick in my mouth then get an attack of morality?<eos> This never happened.<eos> You never used to be this way.<eos> I have a family now.<eos> A family made you stupid.<eos> You take those two champagne bottles in your refrigerator and fuck them.<eos> You son-of-a-bitch.<eos> You get back here and finish what you started.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Do you?
Scarlett, you're blind. She looks like a big meringue.<eos> Dear friends, what a joy it is to welcome you to our church on this wonderful day for Angus and Laura.<eos> Before we start the service, let us all join together in the first hymn.<eos> Scarlett.<eos> Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God and in the face of this congregation to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony, which is an honourable estate, instituted in the time of man's innocency.<eos> Back in a sec.<eos> If any man can show any just cause or impediment why they may not be lawfully joined together, let him speak now or for ever hold his peace.<eos> Do you promise to love her, comfort her, honour and keep her, in sickness and in health, and, forsaking all others, keep thee only unto her<eos> - for as long as ye both shall live?<eos> - I do.
Said, you know, what I just said about David Cassidy.<eos> You're lovely.<eos> One month later<eos> It was ordained for lifelong faithful relationships and conjugal love. It was ordained for the welfare of human society, which can be strong and happy only when the marriage bond is held in honour.<eos> Into this holy estate these two persons now desire to enter.<eos> Wherefore, if anyone can show any just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together in marriage, let him now declare it.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Please rise.<eos> Do you, Hamish, take this woman Caroline to be your wedded wife and do you, in the presence of God and before this congregation, promise and covenant to be to her a loving and faithful husband until God shall separate you by death?<eos> I do.

The truth of it is, I've loved you from the first second I met you.<eos> - Not going away again, are you? - No.<eos> I might drown. But otherwise, no.<eos> OK.<eos> OK. We'll go in.<eos> But first let me ask you one thing.<eos> Do you think, after we've dried off, after we've spent lots more time together, you might agree not to marry me?<eos> And do you think not being married to me might maybe be something you could consider doing for the rest of your life?<eos> Do you?<eos> I do.
Molly, let me say something.<eos> No.<eos> Don't say anything.<eos> A little young for you, isn't she, Joe?<eos> Who's there?<eos> Hi, Joe.<eos> It's been a long time.<eos> It's Daniel.<eos> Daniel?<eos> Wha... What do...
What you see here is pain.<eos> All you are seeing is pain.<eos> And that is part because our hearts has been broken because you take our kid away.<eos> - We took your... - Listen, Miss fucking social worker!<eos> You listen to my pain!<eos> What did you do for me when I was little?<eos> - Maggie... - My father sexually abused me!<eos> Was that an environmentally healthy safe place to fuckin' be?<eos> ! No! So you whipped me into the fucking home!<eos> Did it do me any good?
Go on!<eos> Clay ?<eos> Bridget, it's me.<eos> They moved it back.<eos> I'll be home when I can.<eos> People saw flames shooting from the building, called the fire department.<eos> By the time the engine got here it was too late, and there were five dead young people.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> Did you get the money?<eos> Did you?
Get off, man!<eos> Clean your face.<eos> Don't be afraid: it's only a machine.<eos> Hey, it's me - designated fuck boy.<eos> I know you're outta town but I just wanted to hear your voice.<eos> I love you! I admit it.<eos> I'm sure you feel the same way<eos> - I'm sure you love you too.<eos> You know Wendy, when you first came to town I really thought you were the one.<eos> I... really did.
Time out! Let me get this straight.<eos> You know her, she knows you.<eos> But she wants to eat him, and everybody's okay with this?<eos> -Did I miss something?<eos> -Relax, Timon.<eos> Wait till everyone finds out you've been here all this time.<eos> And your mother, what will she think?<eos> She doesn't have to know.<eos> Nobody has to know.<eos> Of course they do.
-I'm going back!<eos> Good!<eos> Go on! Get out of here!<eos> Grubs!<eos> Grubs!<eos> Hey. Hey, wake up.<eos> It's okay!<eos> Whoa, whoa! It's okay!<eos> It's me!<eos> Don't ever do that again.
He never used to cry.<eos> He just used to sit next to me and cuddle.<eos> I was more of a mother to him than that goddamned pig ever was.<eos> Hey, don't talk like that about pigs.<eos> They're usually much nicer than people.<eos> But they smell like shit.<eos> Not true.<eos> As a matter of fact, right now I have one in my kitchen, that's very clean,<eos> - and smells very nice. - You don't have a pig in your kitchen.<eos> Yes, I do.
Stop talking like that I'm sorry<eos> Get out of here<eos> I'm sorry<eos> Pa, let's go home<eos> Yes, son, let's go home<eos> This isn't Akira Kurosawa's The Seige of Moscow<eos> Mr. Koskanovich?<eos> Wrong studio<eos> No. 1 3<eos> How do you do
How's that grandson of yours?<eos> The parade.<eos> He thought I looked like Santa Claus.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, yes. You swear to tell the whole truth, so help you god?<eos> Yes.<eos> Uh, don't i put my hand on a bible?<eos> No, sir, you don't.<eos> Well, then, I'll put my hand over my heart instead.<eos> I do . I do .
No further questions.<eos> Mr. Collins, do you wish to cross-examine the witness?<eos> No, your honor.<eos> Do I have to go to jail now? No.<eos> You can go back to your seat.<eos> Your honor... I should like to call my next witness.<eos> Mrs. Rebecca collins.<eos> Order.<eos> You swear to tell the whole truth, so help you god?<eos> I do .
Will you be staying a while?<eos> No, I doubt it.<eos> Naturally.<eos> What's the point? What did you come for, anyway?<eos> Don't try, you don't know yourself.<eos> Does she write to you?<eos> Yes, I got two or three letters. I can't remember where from.<eos> Then silence, no address, nothing.<eos> I did tell you never to let her out of your sight.<eos> But I never did.
Fabienne, where's my father's fucking watch?<eos> Do you know what he had to go through to get me that watch?<eos> I don't have time to go into it, he went through a lot.<eos> All this you could've set on fire, but I specifically reminded you not to forget the fucking watch!<eos> - Now think.<eos> Did you get it?<eos> - I believe so.<eos> You believe so? What does that mean?<eos> You did or didn't get it!<eos> Then I did.
Drink this, it'll do you good.<eos> Go on.<eos> - Is it milk?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Warm milk.<eos> Drink it.<eos> He doesn't know yet?<eos> You didn't know, either.<eos> Neither did I,<eos> They didn't either, or the Inspector.
We have to go all the way now.<eos> We must kill the leaders.<eos> Tonight.<eos> Condé, of course, and D'Aubigné.<eos> Teligny, Beauvoix, Mornay, Du Bartas...<eos> And Navarre!<eos> No! Not Navarre!<eos> Coligny!<eos> You want Coligny dead?<eos> I do too!
- To better ruin you.<eos> Maybe...<eos> Maybe.<eos> Who managed to get you up?<eos> You're lucky,<eos> I can't anymore.<eos> - It's him that she thought dead.<eos> You were eating?<eos> You wish to see her?<eos> You really do?
-It's never too late.<eos> After all, you're giving me a new life.<eos> Really?<eos> When?<eos> When you kill those three bastards.<eos> I'm flattered.<eos> You better get somebody else.<eos> I like your voice.<eos> You don't need an explosives contractor.<eos> Yes, I do.
Which of course is absolutely worthless without a transmitter.<eos> Twenty seconds, and we're hot.<eos> Deactivate it, you sanctimonious prick!<eos> Cut that shit!<eos> OK, you made your point!<eos> Have I?<eos> -That's enough!<eos> -What do you mean?<eos> You think I give a shit if the whole block goes up?<eos> I don't!
Come on, over here!<eos> There. Sit down.<eos> Closer together, closer together!<eos> They're not very bright, these Bulgarians.<eos> Look at me.<eos> No, don't hit me, sir!<eos> They're disciplining him.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - I asked if they beat him.<eos> - And did they?
We're trying to.<eos> You know, the bank tries not to encourage the cheapskates by suggesting an opening offer of $5,000.<eos> Some of these people have been writing us checks for like a nickel.<eos> It's really causing some problems around here.<eos> Well, my check ain't for nowhere as near $5,000.<eos> You reckon I'd still have a chance?<eos> Neighbor, I'd like to say yeah, but I don't wanna lie to you.<eos> Havert you ever considered buying a mobile home?<eos> - Sign says, "No minimum bid."<eos> - Yes sir, it does.
- He could've took anybody.<eos> Charles Manson, super-old people who've already been around 100 years.<eos> My dad was only 34 years old.<eos> I needed him more than you, God!<eos> I needed him more!<eos> - Come here.<eos> - No!<eos> Hang on.<eos> I want him back, Mama.<eos> We all do.
He's closer, if anything.<eos> It's giving me nightmares, Chase.<eos> Did you have one last night?<eos> Ah, it's just the earthquakes, Heather. Maybe.<eos> Maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.<eos> No.<eos> You've gotta get back on the horse sometime.<eos> Look, you had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.<eos> -I know how scary that's been.<eos> Okay. I don't.
Have someplace to go?<eos> Mr. Garibaldi, get out of my way.<eos> No, I can't do that.<eos> - Go back to your quarters.<eos> - No.<eos> - Don't force me to make this official.<eos> - No!<eos> I don't wanna do it but touch a weapon, and I'll kill you where you stand.<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Fire, death, pain.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> - You're sure you're all right?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> It was a vision.<eos> Very powerful.<eos> - You said this place will be destroyed?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
I gotta go.<eos> Catch you later?<eos> Then you are familiar with the techno-mages?<eos> Only by name and reputation.<eos> I've never seen one before.<eos> I wasn't really sure they even existed before now.<eos> Most unfortunate.<eos> On my world, we have had considerable experience with them.<eos> They can be a source of great trouble unless one knows how to deal with them.<eos> - And you do?
- I think not.<eos> We'll go.<eos> Now.<eos> This is not good.<eos> What happened to the prisoner?<eos> A PPG flashed him before he jumped me. It went through his arm.<eos> The flash would cauterize the wound, but still cause damage.<eos> He'll need medical attention.<eos> - If he comes here, we'll take him.<eos> - If he does.
If you can spare a few seconds we'd like to talk about something else we found out.<eos> - Let's walk.<eos> - We have a pretty good lead on what's really happening in the Southside.<eos> Ever heard of Intergang?<eos> Tell me what you've learned.<eos> They just acquire companies, other criminal operations, even governments.<eos> They just swallow them whole and start running them.<eos> Always from a distance, hidden.<eos> You think they're funding the Skins, don't you?<eos> Yes, I do.
Al, I told you that in the strictest confidence.<eos> What're you doing?<eos> Blabbing.<eos> The smog device can be put back on if you just give me your credit card.<eos> Man, I love this gig.<eos> I never realized how much power I've got.<eos> But, Dad, if you don't really believe in this ecology stuff then doesn't that make you a lying bag of sleaze?<eos> Yes, son, but a rich lying bag of sleaze.<eos> You see, we celebrities don't really believe the stuff we're paid to say.<eos> - Well, then why do you do it?
Your mother will probably be okay.<eos> Just don't let her take any more.<eos> I'm gonna send this out to the U.E.O.<eos> And we'll have more information in the morning.<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> I forgive you, Tony.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> Goodnight, Dr. Smith. Goodnight, Dagwood.<eos> Dr. Smith, why does U.E.O. Have to know about this stupid rumor?<eos> Because everybody on the boat does.
How's it going, Jake?<eos> Fine. I've deleted half the Cardassian files.<eos> I can't believe how many subroutines it took to run this ore processor.<eos> It used to be a large operation.<eos> The Cardassians processed 20,000 tons a day.<eos> - That's a lot of ore.<eos> - lt must have been hell.<eos> I heard stories the temperature reached 55 degrees Celsius.<eos> How could the Bajoran workers survive that?<eos> A lot of them didn't.
I never thought I'd hear myself saying this, but I miss taking care of Jake when he was a baby.<eos> I miss holding him, singing to him at night, feeding him...<eos> Listening to him cry, changing his diapers, worrying when he was sick.<eos> I haven't forgotten.<eos> But there are times when I would give almost anything for the days when I could make Jake happy just by lifting him over my head.<eos> Good night.<eos> Hey.<eos> How about a hug for the old man?<eos> Why didn't you tell me you were going to invite Mardah?<eos> I did.
What is your name?<eos> Can you understand me?<eos> My name is Garvin.<eos> My name is Garvin.<eos> I thought I told you to go home.<eos> I know.<eos> I do not know my name.<eos> What?<eos> You asked if I knew my name.<eos> I do not.
Could be an ink stamp, like they give at a party or a club.<eos> Can you read it?<eos> It is possible that the heat burned the ink permanently into the lower levels of the skin.<eos> An old coroner's trick.<eos> I can make a quarter appear from behind your ear.<eos> Are you about to ask what a normal person like me is doing in a place like this?<eos> How do you define normal?<eos> Misha, red wine.<eos> I don't.<eos> How do you?
- Come on.<eos> - Come on, open up, honey.<eos> Come on!<eos> - No, please don't. I don't want...<eos> OK, that's fine, Dorothy. Starve to death.<eos> See if I care.<eos> Why aren't you eating your food, Leo?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> It's Dorothy. She needs more.<eos> We both do.
I like your colors.<eos> I love your fuckin' colors. Your colors are wonderful.<eos> Geez, I'm peeing' here!<eos> Hey, this is supposed to be a wedding here.<eos> Now, where's the goddamn bride?<eos> All right, we all came out here today so Bubbles and Highside here can get married.<eos> I want all you fuckin' assholes to show a little bit of respect.<eos> Do you, Bubbles, swear on this bible you wanna let this... smelly old scuzball, Highside, lubricate your cylinder and...<eos> Flush out your oil tank?<eos> I do.
It's just a term of endearment.<eos> - A what?<eos> - Let's get outta here.<eos> Hey, Sid.<eos> Heh, get your ass up here, man. Come on.<eos> Now, Waldo, this individual that you see before you is the man I've been talkin' about.<eos> How many months we been workin' together?<eos> Two, three?<eos> Who counts?<eos> Man, I do.
Lucky me.<eos> -Barry, I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> -No, no. It's...<eos> -I mean, you saved my life.<eos> -Self-interest.<eos> I... I've been watching you out of my office for such a long time.<eos> The other day, I gathered up the nerve to actually speak to you. I made a fool out of myself. But I thought, hey, I'll have another chance to speak to you someday, right?<eos> -But then you...<eos> Well... -We spoke?<eos> -Yeah. Yeah, we did.
Because it's a different country.<eos> You used to read poetry.<eos> It was so nice when you read it to me.<eos> Newland, you'll catch your death.<eos> Of course.<eos> But then he realised, "I am dead.<eos> "I've been dead for months and months. "<eos> Then it occurred to him that she might die.<eos> People did.<eos> Young people, healthy people did.
There's those Irish bastards, Ronnie.<eos> Irish scum.<eos> My name's Giuseppe Conlon.<eos> I'm an innocent man.<eos> So is my son.<eos> We shouldn't even be in here.<eos> Get that fucking scum off my floor.<eos> I said, knock it off!<eos> - They must know they've made a mistake.<eos> - No, they don't.
Yeah.<eos> Cos Early, he don't think that women should smoke or drink or cuss.<eos> So you know what I do?<eos> I spell all my cuss words.<eos> S...<eos> Ouch.<eos> S-H...<eos> Ouch! Owie.<eos> S-H-l-T!<eos> But you don't do any of those other things?
Thanks.<eos> Frank wanted me to stay.<eos> Here.<eos> Make sureit heals properly.<eos> Change the bandage and all.<eos> Change the bandage?<eos> Whatever.<eos> I'll run down, get more ointment.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> How long did Frank....
- Good to see ya. We want "Mant!" We want "Mant!"<eos> We want "Mant!" We want "Mant!"<eos> We want "Mant!" We want "Mant!"<eos> Down here looks good.<eos> Hello, I'm Lawrence Woolsey.<eos> The feeling at this atomic test site is an anxious one, but then, you're about to see for yourselves what I mean.<eos> my terrifying new process, Atomo Vision, puts you, the audience, at ground zero.<eos> Not a safe place to be.<eos> But today, there is no safe place to be.<eos> How we doing, nurse?
What?<eos> Look, where are you from, sempai?<eos> - Scotland Yard?<eos> - No. Scotland back yard.<eos> So how did you become the special liaison officer for Los Angeles?<eos> And uh... who is what-s-her-name?<eos> What you should be asking is why you and I were put together last night.<eos> - I was on duty.<eos> Nakamoto requested you.<eos> - No, they didn't.
We know exactly what we do!<eos> That last choir was rather good.<eos> What she's done with the children is amazing.<eos> Well, Sister Mary Clarence is no ordinary nun.<eos> You don't have to tell me that.<eos> You're not angry with me for misleading you?<eos> Not at all. You're free to fool me any time you want.<eos> Now, ladies and gentlemen, from San Francisco, the choir of St Francis High School, under the direction of Sister Mary Clarence, also singing "Joyful, Joyful".<eos> Hearts unfold like flowers before thee Your teacher says take off your robes.<eos> Do it quickly.
- If something happens...<eos> You're like his stepmother, holding the purse strings.<eos> No. We worked too hard to save that.<eos> I'm sorry, Paul, we just can't.<eos> Look, no problem.<eos> I understand.<eos> - I'll meet you after work.<eos> - Sure.<eos> If your dad loves you, he'll get you the ticket.<eos> He does.
I'm out of here.<eos> Goodbye. I love you.<eos> Clarise, did you move your car?<eos> - Thanks, Derrick.<eos> I'll have...<eos> - White wine spritzer?<eos> - And you, sir?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - You look good.<eos> - So do you.
I won't let you do this!<eos> I accept your offer.<eos> Mr. Webb?<eos> - Is the defense ready?<eos> - Y es, Your Honor.<eos> The defense calls as its first witness Mrs. John Sommersby.<eos> Webb, what the hell is this?<eos> Place your left hand on the Bible.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth so help you God?<eos> - Y es, I do.
That's true.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You're still alive.<eos> Have a cigarrette.<eos> - It won't make me less afraid.<eos> - Asshole.<eos> What are you thinking about?<eos> I'm not.<eos> If you start thinking, you go crazy.<eos> So I don't.
Miss Putnam, a stewardess, was abducted from her home, then taken to another location, where she was murdered.<eos> The brutal crime reminds many of the Polish Hillstranglings.<eos> There's no connection other than the victim being a white female.<eos> The Polish Hill victims were strangled, not shot at close range.<eos> - You picked the wrong house to rob.<eos> - You got nothing worth stealing.<eos> - It's been a long time.<eos> - I could've killed you.<eos> - I wanted to surprise you.<eos> - You did.
- Afternoon.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Give me the bottle.<eos> Let me rephrase that:<eos> Give me the bottle now.<eos> - You know this is a no-wake zone?<eos> - No, sir, I didn't.<eos> - Drive a little slower next time.<eos> - We have to give them a ticket.<eos> - No, we don't.
We can put him under review. I'll call internal affairs.<eos> - He'll be put under surveillance.<eos> - He is under surveillance.<eos> - Close surveillance?<eos> - It doesn't get any closer.<eos> Thank you very much, Officer Sacco.<eos> I'd like to call Detective Emily Harper.<eos> Raise your right hand, please.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth?<eos> - I do.
- We mustn't let down the Lieutenant! - Yes!<eos> Whoever doesn't try his hardest... is going to suffer!<eos> Ready, and start!<eos> Yes! In order to practice kung fu, you must have a body as hard as steel!<eos> Keep going! Don't stop! Zhang Jun Bao, you killed those people.<eos> It's your fault.<eos> You did it.<eos> You did.<eos> You deserve to die.<eos> You did it! You did it!
- Which is your room?<eos> - 417 Nice room.<eos> You should see the staff quarters<eos> Well, here's your room<eos> I've considered suicide, but what would happen to her?<eos> Goodbye, Monsieur<eos> I won't ask "Was it good"?<eos> No, don't ask<eos> I won't ask you, either<eos> No, don't
How did you do that?<eos> Dewey decimal numbers. He put the book back out of order.<eos> Flatbush Avenue Public Library. Wow.<eos> The prints match.<eos> Hello. Lab at Quantico.<eos> Yes, hello. This is Lemar, Salt Lake City.<eos> I just found another book the killer looked at.<eos> Why didn't you let me know?<eos> That's what the reports do. They tell you what we found out.<eos> No, I don't...
Ask for Caine.<eos> We will talk.<eos> Her parents will wanna thank you.<eos> I am grateful for their thanks.<eos> SUZANNA:<eos> This is for you.<eos> Ha.<eos> It is a drawing of me?<eos> It says, "Love, Suzanna."<eos> Yes, it does.
It all seems so simple when you're young.<eos> And the path ahead is so clear.<eos> You're gonna do great things with your life.<eos> And then loyalties are betrayed promises get broken.<eos> Mostly the ones you made to yourself.<eos> And everything you thought was important in life doesn't seem to matter to anyone else.<eos> People try and steal your soul.<eos> And you're alone.<eos> You don't know what it's like to be alone.<eos> - But I do. - No.
I love animals and-- And pizza and Tanya Tucker.<eos> I don't smoke. I don't drink much, except for very good wine.<eos> I take lovers one at a time, I don't spit, and I cannot walk past garbage without picking it up and putting it in the trash can.<eos> I'm proud of the choices that I've made in my life.<eos> And I think that they should count for something.<eos> Yes, I am occasionally frightened and confused and I hope and I dream, but that does not make me insane.<eos> Your Honor, a noble speech does not change the truth.<eos> KAREN:<eos> You think I need help.<eos> Well, so do I.
Let me just take a wild guess here.<eos> You want the Daily Planet to put you up in the honeymoon suite... until we can figure out what's happening with Apocalypse Consulting.<eos> - Thanks, Chief. - Now, wait.<eos> Just hold on, Lois.<eos> We're talking a major surveillance operation here. This is major.<eos> A Washington VIP selling highly classified information.<eos> Maybe I should contact my source.<eos> The source.<eos> Find out if there's anything to this before we get in too deep.<eos> - You don't...
Dad, you can't possibly beat these old guys.<eos> They're in great shape.<eos> For once in your life, quit while you're still behind.<eos> - So you don't think I can win, eh?<eos> - Oh, Daddy, I think you can win.<eos> I made a joke.<eos> That was good.<eos> So an old woman, a gnome and a dullard don't think I can win.<eos> - No.<eos> - No, we actually don't.
Honey, you just make yourself nice and snugly and Mommy's gonna find you a story.<eos> Oh, well, I can't read you that.<eos> Oh, I've been looking for this.<eos> How did that get in there?<eos> Oh, here's something.<eos> How about a nice pirate story?<eos> It's very exciting.<eos> A Ship Called Passion.<eos> Does it have a lot of action and stuff?<eos> Oh, yes, it does.
- Someone like me.<eos> I've been thinking about what you said.<eos> I could use some help during these negotiations.<eos> I accept.<eos> Then we're partners.<eos> Not quite. I don't need a partner.<eos> - l get 25%.<eos> - 15.<eos> - 20.<eos> - Done.
- l hear them, Major.<eos> They're calling to me.<eos> Don't listen to him, Nerys.<eos> Allow yourself to hear them.<eos> They're calling to you.<eos> Blasphemy.<eos> - Listen to them, Nerys.<eos> - Help me to hear them.<eos> - l don't know how.<eos> - But you do.
But I don't understand what we can learn from your death.<eos> Then you do not yet understand what it is to be Klingon.<eos> Worf.<eos> In spite of everything that's happened, I still sense that you care for me.<eos> Am I wrong?<eos> You talk so much about being a warrior, about honour and death.<eos> Is it so hard to speak of love?<eos> Worf, please.<eos> I would not have thought it possible to love a Romulan.<eos> But you do.
Why aren't you trying to make yourself angry again?<eos> Anger is negative.<eos> I wanted to concentrate on something positive.<eos> Data, feelings aren't positive and negative, they simply exist.<eos> It's what we do with them that becomes good or bad.<eos> For example, feeling angry about an injustice could lead someone to take a positive action to correct it.<eos> But my study of humanity indicates that some emotions are harmful, such as jealousy or hatred.<eos> Those are very strong emotions and you're right, very little good can come from them.<eos> But I don't think that an exploration of anger need necessarily lead to hatred or malice.<eos> But what if it does, Counsellor?
I won champion standing.<eos> This quantum fissure is nothing to worry about?<eos> No.<eos> The inverse warp field resealed it.<eos> I look forward to your report.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> I know what you are planning.<eos> I will not be surprised.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Of course you don't.
- You're on board because of him. - No.<eos> Cmdr Riker and I are friends.<eos> Close friends, but nothing more.<eos> Why don't we sit down?<eos> Do you remember the last time we saw each other?<eos> Like yesterday.<eos> The Janaran Falls on Betazed.<eos> It was the day before you started on the Potemkin.<eos> - We were going to meet on Risa.<eos> - We never did.
Command codes verified.<eos> That should do it.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> The computer won't release the command pathways.<eos> Geordi.<eos> - Why did you do that?<eos> - Captain.<eos> I have determined how Moriarty was able to leave the holodeck.<eos> He never did.
We'll get back to work...<eos> - at about 0700.<eos> - Roger that, Houston.<eos> Let's get to work on that telemetry problem.<eos> We've got a big day ahead of us.<eos> (Belt) Let's just let the electronic press... get their sound equipment set.<eos> (reporters shouting)<eos> I know you have a lot of questions.<eos> I'll get to them. How did he know what he did was going to work?<eos> He didn't.
George Jefferson.<eos> So it was George Washington that was married to Weezy?<eos> Al, I was at the beauty parlour today and your name is on everyone's lips.<eos> Well, that and bonbon crumbs.<eos> Everyone thinks you're a stud.<eos> - But you don't.<eos> - Sure, I do.<eos> You do?<eos> Okay, your relentless interrogation has broken me.<eos> I don't.
Let's go!<eos> Move on.<eos> You!<eos> Look forward.<eos> Stand with the rest.<eos> Peru, have you seen my son?<eos> Have you seen Lucas?<eos> He got away?<eos> Did he?<eos> - Yes, he did.
Keep the plumbline vertical.<eos> And don't move!<eos> A mistake of one degree and we'll be off 600 leagues.<eos> What do you read?<eos> -28.<eos> - That's it!<eos> 28th parallel!<eos> And we'll follow it until we reach land.<eos> How do you know that we'll find land on the 28th parallel?<eos> I don't!
Really?<eos> What's the twist?<eos> The detective falls for the wrong girl but he doesn't die.<eos> What happens to them?<eos> They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.<eos> It won't sell.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Somebody has to die.<eos> Why?<eos> Somebody always does.
See? If I met a man like him, I might even consider it.<eos> You've got him round your little finger.<eos> If I could have done that with your father!<eos> No, dear. Marriage wouldn't suit you at all.<eos> You weren't born for that.<eos> I mean, men are all selfish.<eos> You should find a nice girl who'll love you, and keep house for you.<eos> Now, you...<eos> Don't any men come into your shop?<eos> Of course they do!
If I'd had children, obviously I wouldn't be here.<eos> I have no more reason to live, you see.<eos> I'm sure you understand.<eos> Before I came here, I started drinking heavily.<eos> Getting away saved my life.<eos> What happens to me, what I do now no longer means anything.<eos> People come to visit the park, tourists come and go through the hotel.<eos> I'm sure they think I'm part of the staff.<eos> I had you put next door, in case you needed any help.<eos> And I did.
They all in trouble?<eos> Just one.<eos> He likes you.<eos> Is that protecting us?<eos> Yeah, he's a trained noisemaker.<eos> Come here, Foster.<eos> Just what we need.<eos> I don't like big dogs.<eos> They don't know who they're eating.<eos> And this one does?
Just one.<eos> He likes you.<eos> Is that protecting us?<eos> Yeah, he's a trained noisemaker.<eos> Come here, Foster.<eos> Just what we need.<eos> I don't like big dogs.<eos> They don't know who they're eating.<eos> And this one does?<eos> Yeah, this one does.
Maybe it has to do with you.<eos> - And we can't walk out of here at night.<eos> - I know.<eos> Let's stay tonight and walk out at first light.<eos> I was an idiot last night.<eos> What'd you think about today?<eos> I think this is no maniac.<eos> He knows what he's doing.<eos> You're right.<eos> He does.
I can't believe...<eos> I'm a girl!<eos> Ernest, we gotta stop.<eos> I know we... I know we...<eos> Ernest, don't be angry with me.<eos> I'm fighting this as hard as I can, but just... Look at you!<eos> She's already destroyed your career.<eos> Now she's breaking your heart, stealing your pride, flaunting her lovers all over town.<eos> You know about that?<eos> Everyone does.
Take the horse.<eos> Shannon, I saw you galloping in the fields.<eos> Dignity, Shannon.<eos> A lady must always be civilized even when she rides.<eos> No one saw me riding, Mother.<eos> I saw you.<eos> Yes, Mother.<eos> "A lady must always be civilized."<eos> She never leaves us alone, does she?<eos> No, she doesn't.
Too slow.<eos> You come to the body, you come to the face.<eos> And you move out of the way. When he's coming around, you get out of the way.<eos> They just stand there, look at them.<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on! Come on now!<eos> Hello there, Joseph.<eos> Hello, Cara.<eos> All done up like a gentleman.<eos> How do you do, ladies?
- Where's Sam?<eos> - He's on his way.<eos> Call your first witness. - Where is he?<eos> - He'll be here.<eos> Don't worry. Lieutenant!<eos> Call your witness.<eos> Defence calls Colonel Nathan Jessep.<eos> Colonel Jessep, raise your right hand, please, sir.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> - Yes, I do.
After what I did, how do you know you can trust me?<eos> Bottom line, John, I ain't no different than all those assholes out there.<eos> We all trust you, for chrissake.<eos> That was really dumb, coming out here on this ledge.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Bernie.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Grab him!<eos> John, grab him!<eos> Don't!
-Alexandra.<eos> -Welcome. Jack.<eos> -Good, thank you. Where have you boys been trapping?<eos> West of the Continental.<eos> Why is Uncas with you?<eos> He should have settled with a woman, started a family by now.<eos> Uncas, look. Mohawk field we saw was five-mile long on the river.<eos> Chief Joseph Brandt's field.<eos> -You take much fur?<eos> -That we did. -Lots.
I'll go. I'm ready now.<eos> I gotta sign something?<eos> I don't want you!<eos> I want her!<eos> The one who hit the ball!<eos> You can climb back under the cow.<eos> She's good.<eos> She's very good.<eos> She pitches.<eos> She didn't today, because she did yesterday.
You wearing that? That dress?<eos> What about it?<eos> Couldn't you wear something else?<eos> What's wrong with it?<eos> Oh, nothing.<eos> What do you mean, nothing?<eos> You think it makes me look fat, it makes my ass look fat.<eos> Did I say that?<eos> - You think I've got a fat ass. - You said that.<eos> I didn't.
"I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle."<eos> Remember what you told me in prison?<eos> "I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle."<eos> Brother Malcolm what do you want?<eos> A new house?<eos> It's the money, isn't it?<eos> But we tell the whole world that we're moral leaders because we follow the personal example of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.<eos> Elijah Muhammad is a human being and so are you.<eos> - Do you know your Bible?<eos> - Do you?
Want to know what it is?<eos> - Did he tell you? - He's asking.<eos> I'm asking you.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Do you want to know?<eos> - I don't know. Do you?<eos> I wanted to know, but now I'm not sure.<eos> - Hold on.<eos> We're discussing it.<eos> - Neither. I do and I don't.
Hi.<eos> - Actually, I'm gonna go-<eos> - What' s everybody drinking? - Rit?<eos> - Oh. - Can I fill you up there?<eos> - I'll have another Dewar's, thanks.<eos> - Pete? - Uh, no, thank you. I'm -<eos> Oh, don't worry. I'll get it. You two just relax.<eos> So, one, uh, Dewar's, and one, uh, beer.<eos> # I don't want anybody else # How do you know the Sokols?<eos> I don't.
No, before that.<eos> I'm not senile. I know.<eos> I know.<eos> Yeah, I thought maybe it was salmonella from those horrible chicken wings, and I was i magining it all.<eos> So how was our honeymoon?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Does he know you know?<eos> - He?<eos> - She, whatever.<eos> Yes. He does.
I'll tell him off one day.<eos> Our 100th anniversary will last another few minutes and yet, our store is still so fresh.<eos> Enjoy the celebration and remember if need be the youth of the Grandes Galeries.<eos> I'm looking for a keyboard with MIDI switches to connect it to a computer.<eos> I'd like a polyphonic keyboard with a multitude of octaves.<eos> I'm looking for a reliable product.<eos> I would also like an extra memory card to add sounds to the ones it already has.<eos> Even more sounds.<eos> Yes, if possible.<eos> -This one does it.
Stop shooting.<eos> I know you are in the building and I know you can hear me.<eos> God.<eos> You should not have come back, Marty.<eos> I won and you lost.<eos> If our friendship had meant anything to you at all, that is the way you should have left it.<eos> But you always had to be the one to win, didn't you?<eos> You were the one who got away with things while I never did.<eos> You always had to get the girl, didn't you?<eos> So I never did... At least not until now.
Say it!<eos> Say it!<eos> Yes!<eos> I'm sorry, Cos.<eos> You could have shared this with me.<eos> I know.<eos> You could have had the power.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> Don't you know the places we can go with this?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Who's next?<eos> Huh...?<eos> How 'bout it?<eos> Who wants some?<eos> Huh?<eos> Who wants to have a little?<eos> You.<eos> You want some more?<eos> You want a little?<eos> Do ya?
Well, where is it?<eos> It is written - a leader will come from the corn, he shall make us one.<eos> There ain't nothing out there, Mordechai, except a lot of corn.<eos> Maybe that's your truth.<eos> Look, you can hang around here if you want to.<eos> But we're out of here.<eos> No!<eos> He Who Walks Behind the Rows shall not allow it.<eos> Do you really think it was all Isaac's doing, Jedediah?<eos> Do you?
How could you? A bitch wouldn't leave her puppies. She left you.<eos> Now she wants you to come.<eos> Where was she before, screw her.<eos> I've nothing to do with that.<eos> You hid the letter. You trust her more than me.<eos> And you read other people's mail...<eos> Do you believe this shit she put in her letter?<eos> Like, her conscience...<eos> Fuck it all.<eos> No... I don't.
Happy birthday to you<eos> Hey, Beck, we're back.<eos> Got your favorite pizza.<eos> Pineapple and anchovy.<eos> I believe you forgot something.<eos> Oh, yeah, extra cheese.<eos> I've been thinking about this extra cheese thing.<eos> It's a rip-off.<eos> How do you know if you get extra cheese or not?<eos> - You don't.
No, it didn't.<eos> - Mom. I'm not gonna go to the party.<eos> - What's the matter, honey?<eos> I just found out there's gonna be an orchestra.<eos> That means I have to dance.<eos> - That'll be fun.<eos> - No, it won't.<eos> - I'll have to do old-people dancing.<eos> - Old-people dancing?<eos> Yeah, the kind you and Dad do.
Now Bud's even more depressed.<eos> Say something to him, Al.<eos> Son F Troop's on.<eos> F Troop.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'll have plenty of dates once F Troop is over.<eos> Plenty, I said.<eos> And by the way in case you're wondering why I'm in my pajamas I wear them under my clothes so I'm ready when a chick wants to go to bed.<eos> They know you're lying.<eos> No, they don't.
We are talking here.<eos> I refuse to talk to my wife when I have a TV in the house.<eos> Al, I wanna talk.<eos> Talk to me!<eos> I'm out of gas.<eos> Aren't you supposed to turn the car off before you say that?<eos> Well, what's the difference?<eos> I mean, we both know I'm not out of gas.<eos> Oh, very nice.<eos> Now we both do.
That's not your feminine side speaking.<eos> No, my feminine side is on the couch watching Oprah and occasionally pushing aside a breast to scratch my knee.<eos> Bitch.<eos> Now it's my turn.<eos> Oh, please don't let her land on Sexual Intimacy.<eos> Sexual Intimacy.<eos> Okay.<eos> "If your lover suddenly was unable to perform anymore and was a shoe salesman and named Al..."<eos> It couldn't possibly say that.<eos> Oh, my God, it does.
I've accessed the basic system directories.<eos> Can we get a status report?<eos> Life-support systems throughout the ship are fully operational.<eos> Navigation, propulsion off line.<eos> What about communications?<eos> - Completely disrupted.<eos> - That rules out a distress signal.<eos> If we even knew where to send it.<eos> Do we have an on-board communications system?<eos> We do now.
Indeed. I know.<eos> I was there.<eos> This is my first officer, Cmdr Steven Mullen.<eos> And my security chief, Lt Morgan Kelly.<eos> And you have survived all this time as...?<eos> Spirits? Ghosts?<eos> But you're a man who would never believe in ghosts.<eos> Isn't that true?<eos> You see, Troi knows you.<eos> And so I do as well.
Installation of the new engine core is complete.<eos> We are ready to switch to internal power.<eos> Understood.<eos> Disconnect the power-transfer beam.<eos> We are now on internal power.<eos> Capt Picard, please accept my sincere thanks on behalf of the Romulan Empire.<eos> Don't listen to him, Captain.<eos> Our pleasure, Mirok.<eos> I hope this example of cooperation between our two peoples will not be an isolated incident.<eos> As do I, Captain.
I found... a penny!<eos> Could this be the best day of my life?<eos> Looks like we have a new champion.<eos> Ah, my beloved family.<eos> How was church?<eos> -<eos> I, on the other hand, have been having the best day of my life... and I owe it all to skipping church.<eos> That's a terrible thing to say!<eos> Kids, your father doesn't really mean that.<eos> Like fun I don't.
No, all right! Shit.<eos> All right.<eos> No, all right.<eos> Okay, Fink, let's chow.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> It's just a B-picture.<eos> I bring it in on budget, they book it without screening it.<eos> Life is too short.<eos> Lipnick said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.<eos> Sure he did.
- It is a miracle.<eos> L 'amour.<eos> Well, Lumiere, old friend.<eos> Shall we let bygones be bygones?<eos> Of course, mon ami.<eos> I told you she would break the spell.<eos> I beg your pardon, old friend, but I believe I told you.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> I told you.<eos> You most certainly did not, you pompous, paraffin-headed pea-brain!
Get your ass out of there.<eos> Ricky, come on out of the bathroom, baby.<eos> Check this out.<eos> Here come the reverend.<eos> So, what college you from?<eos> I'm from USC.<eos> You got to have a scholarship to go to SC?<eos> No, but it helps.<eos> Can you hook me up with a scholarship?<eos> -What do you do?
Friendly Rooster, for instance.<eos> He wakes up only once at night.<eos> He sleeps like a baby.<eos> But he looks like...<eos> They look like angels, don't you think?<eos> And then they grow up and then nothing but heartache.<eos> - Aren't you trying for a girl?<eos> - May I have liked two.<eos> But my wife says she went through the hell.<eos> - They always do.
No, this is one of your rules.<eos> Rules are rules, but everyone can make mistakes.<eos> Let me remind you that they've just covered your lanterns.<eos> But I am still a mistress.<eos> Mistresses are mistresses! Maids are maids!<eos> Big sister, the Master is away In front of everyone here you be the judge.<eos> I broke a rule and they covered my lanterns. What happens if a servant breaks the rule?<eos> Follow the old custom!<eos> The First Mistress said you could get up if you apologized.<eos> Why do this?
It's cold here. Go back to your room.<eos> What happened?<eos> The Third Mistress and Doctor Gao were in a hotel in town.<eos> When the Second Mistress had the door opened they were still in bed.<eos> Such sin!<eos> Did the Second Mistress say I told her?<eos> You told her when you were drunk yesterday.<eos> I was so shocked.<eos> I said it?<eos> You did.
Janet Dubois.<eos> How grown-up we are.<eos> What's going on? What's all this about life and death?<eos> We can d... we can discuss it later.<eos> Ty, show Janet to one of the guest rooms.<eos> She can wear some of Rachel's clothes.<eos> - You can have my room, Janet.<eos> - You're not gonna be in it, are you?<eos> I didn't send that wire.<eos> But... if you didn't, then who did?
- Athens General.<eos> - Call Athens General.<eos> We have a cardiac emergency.<eos> Tell Lou to fire up the ambulance.<eos> No, forget it. They have a helicopter. Tell them to send it.<eos> - Get me Zeb's medical history.<eos> - I better call Dr. Hogue.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Listen to me, Hogue is not here. I'm here.<eos> You do it.
Answer the question, Mrs. Bennett.<eos> Because she-<eos> She's the best friend I ever had, and I love her.<eos> Thank you, Mrs. Bennett.<eos> That will be all.<eos> The defense calls as its last witness... the Rev. Herbert Scroggins.<eos> Place your right hand on the Bible, please.<eos> I brought my own, if you don't mind.<eos> You swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
I must remind you gentlemen, that we are extremely concerned about donning artifacts.<eos> That won't be a problem, monsieur.<eos> All the good stuff has been stolen a long time ago.<eos> It's either the British Museum, or the Louvre.<eos> What time does the Louvre close? I beg your pardon.<eos> The museum. The Louvre.<eos> What time does it close? -I have no idea. As far as I know it's always closed.<eos> To the Louvre.<eos> I thought you didn't like museums?<eos> I don't.
- It was for us.<eos> - And expensive.<eos> Jack, don't do that.<eos> You could put someone's eye out.<eos> Maggie.<eos> Maggie.<eos> Peter, it's number 14.<eos> Sorry.<eos> What do you say to Granny Wendy?<eos> - "How do you do?"
You!<eos> That's right, you!<eos> No, not you!<eos> Not you.<eos> You.<eos> You!<eos> You bet against me bringing Pan back here, didn't you?<eos> Tell your captain the truth.<eos> Say it. Say it.<eos> I did.
I got some mosquito bites that need scratching.<eos> How about you and me go fiddle with the hydraulics?<eos> Frank.<eos> Don't talk like that!<eos> Frank, why are you looking at me like that?<eos> Come on, Frankie, you're scaring me.<eos> Frank, you're scaring me.<eos> Did I say the wrong thing?<eos> Is it you don't know when I say something nice?<eos> Don't.
"That's Jack's friend! "<eos> Will you testify, Beverly?<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> - I thought we had an agreement.<eos> - I don't want to be another statistic.<eos> - We could call you in.<eos> If they can kill the President of the United States you think they'll think twice about a two-bit showgirl like me?<eos> I understand the pressure you're under.<eos> Don't think that I don't.<eos> We both do.
I told you how they called me high yellow, yellow bitch. White honky, honky white; white nigger, nigger white;<eos> Octoroon, quadroon, half-breed, mongrel!<eos> And what do you do?<eos> - Do you love this girl? - Ohh!<eos> Oh, Drew. - You've gotta be kidding me.<eos> - Do you love her?<eos> - I love you.<eos> - Do you love her?<eos> No, no, no!<eos> No, I don't.
Always, darling.<eos> The usual?<eos> - Night-night, mom.<eos> - Night, darling.<eos> - You play the tuba?<eos> - No.<eos> I used to.<eos> But not now.<eos> I mean, I was before you arrived.<eos> I did.
- Freddy, I ain't changing my show.<eos> - I'll tell you what will happen, and I'll give you the options.<eos> They told me there's been complaints that your simulated orgasms, blah, blah, blah are against their rules and regulations, blah, blah, blah...<eos> - I am not changing my show, Freddy.<eos> - I know, but wait while I straighten it out.<eos> - What's to straighten out?<eos> - Hopefully we can change their minds.<eos> Freddy, all you have to do is tell them I am not changing my show.<eos> - This is how I choose to express myself.<eos> - I did that.
What are you up to?<eos> Get us some coffee.<eos> If you like, I'll go at once.<eos> My kingdom!<eos> My wondrous country, that I held in my mortal hands!<eos> My country...<eos> My wondrous country, that I held in my mortal hands!<eos> My country, now no bigger than this flame.<eos> Don't burn!<eos> Don't!
I love being single!<eos> I haven't had this much sex since I was a Scout leader.<eos> At the time, I was dating a lot.<eos> I told you the bombing wouldn't work!<eos> We had no choice.<eos> Look at the paper!<eos> "President to give Meinheimer blank cheque at press club dinner."<eos> That's in two days!<eos> - I know!<eos> - We all do.
There'll be hell to pay.<eos> We've been made. We gotta get out of town.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - I got busted for bug powder.<eos> I started hallucinating behind the stuff.<eos> God knows what I really said to those two flatfeet. I'm not even sure how I got out of there.<eos> Did you bring back tomorrow's bug powder?<eos> Did you, Bill?<eos> Did you?
WHY?<eos> [WILLARD] I MET A MAN IN THE COFFEE SHOP WHO DOESN'T LIKE THEM.<eos> [BILLIE] HE'S CRAZY, THEY'RE NICE.<eos> EVEN THOUGH MOM SAYS LILY IS LONG-SUFFERING.<eos> - [WILLARD] WHAT'S THAT MEAN?<eos> - I DON'T KNOW.<eos> IT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD, AND PEOPLE NEVER SAY IT ABOUT MEN.<eos> IT REALLY MAKES ME SICK THAT I HAVE TO GROW UP TO BE A WOMAN.<eos> - DID YOU BUILD THIS?<eos> - NO. BEN DID.
WHY DID YOU WALK THAT RAILING THIS MORNING?<eos> I DON'T KNOW.<eos> I'M JUST SICK OF BEING AFRAID.<eos> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?<eos> I'M ALWAYS AFRAID OF THINGS.<eos> I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT I AM.<eos> AND I JUST THOUGHT IF I DID SOMETHING THAT REALLY SCARED ME, MAYBE I WOULDN'T BE AFRAID ANYMORE.<eos> DID IT WORK?<eos> YEAH...<eos> IT DID.
For certain.<eos> Why?<eos> Because Allah loves wondrous variety.<eos> How is it that a once arrogant young nobleman has found contentment living rough with the salt of the earth?<eos> I've seen knights panic at the first hint of battle.<eos> And I've seen the lowliest unarmed squire pull a spear from his own body to defend a dying horse.<eos> Nobility's not a birthright.<eos> It's defined by one's actions.<eos> It's interesting to hear you say that.<eos> I didn't.
- We go back to sleep.<eos> - No, I mean to him.<eos> He's already asleep.<eos> He's just like anybody else.<eos> We don't touch any of them until we get them all.<eos> How bad did that scare you last night?<eos> Some.<eos> But I didn't mind.<eos> And I liked it.<eos> What did you like?
Mountain Devil... Whatever happens, you're always my sister.<eos> I'll talk to the Priestess, someone else can marry him...<eos> Then we can stay together.<eos> Lotus, I really love you.<eos> I believed, that when you went out, you were a good girl...<eos> Tell me where they are hiding?<eos> Priestess, forgive me, I was wr ong.<eos> Forgive you?<eos> Tell me, how should I punish her?<eos> Why don't we, don't we...
For years they lived peacefully for music.<eos> Then the time came when, once a month, Madeleine put a cloth between her legs.<eos> Toinette outgrew her small viol.<eos> The Sainte Colombes' three-viol concerts were famous.<eos> Regulars at the musical meetings, Mr. Caignet and Mr. Chambonnières praised them vigourously.<eos> They were a fad with the nobility.<eos> What a remarkable musician!<eos> He plays better than I do.<eos> Yes...<eos> He does.
"Hades", "The Boat of Charon",<eos> "The Weeping", Tomb of Sorrows".<eos> I was horrified that my master wanted his works to die with him.<eos> I couldn't stand living without hearing it all... if only once.<eos> I wanted those works.<eos> In any weather, I'd leave Versailles. At night I'd go to the Bièvre valley.<eos> I followed the ancient trail Madeleine had shown me long ago.<eos> For three years, each time, I wondered:<eos> "Will he play these melodies tonight?" "Will this be the right night?"<eos> He never did.
What about the petition?<eos> They wouldn't let me give it to them.<eos> Didn't you give it to anybody?<eos> - No.<eos> - Darn!<eos> We've friends up there.<eos> How can we get in touch with them?<eos> They told us to come up.<eos> - No, he says no.<eos> - He just did.
Listen; there's a dance competition..<eos> ..at Ajit's college tomorrow.<eos> Please, come with us; it will be fun.<eos> What?<eos> Dance competition?<eos> So my brother will dance at the college?<eos> Shucks!<eos> Why shucks, papa?<eos> Amitabh Bachchan dances, too.<eos> So does Vinod Khanna.
How were you left outside, brother?<eos> I was left behind.<eos> - Behind?<eos> But where are you coming from? I've come from above.<eos> - From above directly?<eos> Conducter, ask this thief whether he has a ticket for this bus.<eos> Do you have the ticket for this bus, brother?<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> Do they give tickets up, too?<eos> - Yes, they do.
Right, right.<eos> But first things first.<eos> Research requires funds, am I right?<eos> - You're right, Harry, but this--<eos> - But nothing.<eos> Did you ever have any luck with any of those grants you applied for?<eos> Anybody ever listen to you at a university or a corporation?<eos> - No, Harry.<eos> - Who cares about you?<eos> - You do, Harry.
- Well, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I mean, if I hadn't gone after you I never would have found them, right?<eos> - Hmm.<eos> - Yeah, well, how about this?<eos> You've been very good about keeping the secret of mine and I will keep the secret of yours.<eos> But you are gonna have to get rid of this little souvenir, though.<eos> Oh. Don't worry, I can zap it off with my micro laser in the lab.<eos> That seems a shame.<eos> It's kind of cute, don't you think?<eos> No, I don't.
She'll be comin' 'round the mountain--<eos> All right, all right.<eos> Are we there yet?<eos> No, honey, we're not at the motel yet.<eos> When will we be there?<eos> [IN UNISON] When we get there.<eos> I was just asking.<eos> Don't have a cow.<eos> I think what Michelle's trying to say is she has to go to the bathroom.<eos> No, I don't.
He looked exactly like Wayne Newton.<eos> But we got to talking and I'm sorry I snapped at you guys today.<eos> I just got so wrapped up in this record deal you know, riding around on my high horse that I forgot about the things that are important to me in my life.<eos> And that's the people that I love.<eos> You guys.<eos> So I hope you can forgive me.<eos> Oh, of course I can forgive you.<eos> You can let go now, Kimmy.<eos> Jess, don't be so hard on yourself. We know what pressure you've been under.<eos> No, we don't.
All right, settle down.<eos> Um, grab the jeep, I'll get the bike.<eos> I know how you feel, Ronnie.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> I ran away from home one time.<eos> When my grandpa told me to get lost.<eos> Who cares?<eos> Well, I did.<eos> I didn't understand what he was doing.<eos> Or why. Oh, and now you do, right?
Don't worry, Al.<eos> He's just rebelling.<eos> I did it myself for awhile.<eos> Of course, I just drank drank beer and smoked cigarettes.<eos> But then I wasn't rebelling against heterosexuality.<eos> Speaking of which, I think you've got a problem with your dog.<eos> Oh, we know all about it.<eos> Neither he nor his master can perform.<eos> Well, I can't speak for Al.<eos> The satisfied look on Peggy's face does that.
Oh, you give it a good old stir, sir.<eos> Go on, Desmond, don't be lazy.<eos> The longer you stir, sir, the better your luck will be. Why do you have two?<eos> Well, the big one's for Christmas Day, and the small one's for New Year, silly.<eos> Ah. Oh, yes.<eos> Oh, Mr. Poirot, you must have a stir, too.<eos> Sarah won't let anyone else have a go.<eos> I need all the luck I can get.<eos> This is Sarah, my granddaughter, Mr. Poirot.<eos> How do you do?
I need all the luck I can get.<eos> This is Sarah, my granddaughter, Mr. Poirot.<eos> How do you do?<eos> Mlle. Sarah.<eos> And Mr. Lee-Wortley. M. Lee-Wortley.<eos> -Desmond.<eos> -Desmond.<eos> And Gloria Lee-Wortley, his sister.<eos> Enchanté, mademoiselle.<eos> How do you do?
The crew has decided to stick together.<eos> We all go or we all stay.<eos> Alright.<eos> I'll try.<eos> But I want you to know, this is mutiny.<eos> Now, Number One, look at that control panel.<eos> Now, the yellow control pad, hit that once.<eos> Now the one below it, hit it twice.<eos> That should release the panel underneath.<eos> Yes, it did.
You will sleep Klingon-style.<eos> We do not soften our bodies by putting down a pad.<eos> Good! I prefer it that way.<eos> You will take meals with us.<eos> But we do not serve Federation food.<eos> I've been looking forward to gagh. Haven't had it for ages.<eos> Very fresh.<eos> Well, Captain, we're at the border of the Neutral Zone.<eos> You mean to do this, do you?<eos> Yes, I do.
I promise you.<eos> Daddy, you can't promise me, but thanks for wanting to.<eos> I actually came here to update you on my trip to Seattle.<eos> Right.<eos> Update away.<eos> Okay.<eos> The Packards are using Twin Peaks Savings and Loan to funnel cash to the Ghostwood project.<eos> But the bank is keeping a very low profile.<eos> It seems they don't want any bad publicity.<eos> Oh, they don't?
A French journalist from Hanoi about an hour ago.<eos> You were over Hanoi!<eos> - It was a good mission.<eos> - We blew the shit out of them.<eos> - We didn't come near any hospital.<eos> - You think I don't know that?<eos> I know what you hit.<eos> The Air Force knows what you hit.<eos> So does CTF-77.<eos> So does General Giap and the entire World Communist Union.
I didn't know if you were alive or dead.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Look, I didn't know.<eos> I haven't seen anybody.<eos> The only one I've seen is my father.<eos> You've always been a selfish person.<eos> I admit that.<eos> I'm selfish. I'm a selfish...<eos> Did I ever try to stand in your way or stop you from doing what you had to do?<eos> Did I?
I'm not testifying.<eos> I have a subpoena.<eos> Let me see it.<eos> I can get one.<eos> I think you should leave.<eos> Lady, You're kidding yourself. You think those guys would come here, You, who could put Leo Watts in the gas chamber,<eos> And you tell them You're not testifying, And they' d say, that's a relief.<eos> Thanks. Have a nice day. Then they'd turn around and go home?<eos> They'd never find me.<eos> We did.
Is that you recognize the inevitable.<eos> I don't know what woman You're talking about.<eos> First you lost your briefcase, And now you've lost some woman.<eos> You ought to be more careful.<eos> The people I work for have a large investment in this matter, And they are very determined.<eos> They sound like interesting people. Very interesting.<eos> You have a good dental plan?<eos> What I'm talking about Is probably 1 0 times what you earn in a year,<eos> Including whatever you steal on your expense account. I don't steal. I like an honest man.<eos> So do I. 10 times.
She's in this movie.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Great, now that my relaxation levels have stabilized.<eos> - I don't know how you put up with them.<eos> - I would've quit.<eos> - You can't quit.<eos> If you quit, no one will hire you again.<eos> I like working, so...<eos> I like Evelyn.<eos> - Yeah, I do too.
I know, but the trouble is, I can't feel my life.<eos> I see it all around me and I know that so much of it is good.<eos> But I just take it the wrong way.<eos> It's like this thing with my mother.<eos> I know she does all this stuff because she loves me but I just can't believe it.<eos> And other stuff.<eos> I don't know about your mother.<eos> Maybe she'll stop mothering you when you grow up.<eos> - You don't know my mother.<eos> - I don't.
He's afraid I'll tell the truth about my relationship with Carolyn thus giving the prosecution the motive they've been lacking.<eos> One could argue if the jury feels I'm being truthful about something so painful they should believe me when I say I didn't commit the murder.<eos> What would you think?<eos> If I were a member of the jury?<eos> And I heard you admit how much she meant to you?<eos> I think I'd conclude you were guilty.<eos> I want to testify.<eos> What would you say?<eos> I'd say you were the only man I ever loved.<eos> And I still do.
He's got Iowa plates.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - Where was the Clutter family from?<eos> - Kansas.<eos> Just checking.<eos> Say, the bank was really beautiful, wasn't it?<eos> It sure was, Grimm.<eos> Hey, Phyllis.<eos> Grimm needs a little reassuring.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Please.<eos> DidClausdrivemecrazy?<eos> Even I don't know.<eos> But it's true that I took up to 24 laxatives daily, popped aspirin like MM's, smoked three packs of cigarettes a day, had a problem with alcohol, took Valium and Seconal frequently and consumed large quantities of sweets,<eos> As for my state of mind...<eos> I had not had sex with my husband for years.<eos> My schedule was:<eos> I woke at 9.30, did a little exercise and shopping, and returned to bed at 3 o'clock for the remainder of the afternoon.<eos> I liked to be in bed.<eos> I didn't much like anything else.
We can't all be you, Alan.<eos> Get a doctor to prepare five needles.<eos> One with nothing, two with Valium, amobarbital and insulin, two with just Valium and amobarbital.<eos> We send them to the lab that our famous needle went to.<eos> See if we get a false-positive result.<eos> - If we don't?<eos> - If we don't, I clean the latrines.<eos> You're not gonna believe this.<eos> David Marriott wants money.<eos> Who doesn't?
Anybody!<eos> Well?<eos> Say something!<eos> Do something!<eos> Be a man!<eos> I already have a butler.<eos> Do something!<eos> I don't want this!<eos> I don't! I don't want this!<eos> I don't...
Since he came it's Tommy this, Tommy that.<eos> You got no time for nobody, so I got no time for you.<eos> What are you sayin'?<eos> You're like another person.<eos> You're the other person.<eos> You said I would be number one to you and you lied.<eos> You lied to me and you lied to Mom.<eos> I never lied to you.<eos> Tommy needed my help.<eos> So did I.
If I hadn't seen you on the news I wouldn't have known who his partner was.<eos> Let's take a walk.<eos> You look like a man who likes to get right to the point so I'll be very direct.<eos> - Why the hell not?<eos> Got a light?<eos> Always given David everything he wanted but lately he just won't take anything.<eos> It's as though he's cut me off completely.<eos> David's just not cut out for this, Mr. Pulovski. He's not cut out for it.<eos> I thought we were gonna be direct.<eos> Yeah, so did I.
I'm sorry.<eos> You're sorry.<eos> Look at him taking pictures, will ya? [Chuckles]<eos> What's the big hurry, Usher?<eos> Stiff's not going anywhere.<eos> [Purring] Where did you come from?<eos> [Meows] How did you get in here?<eos> You have to get off the paper. Come on.<eos> [Purring]<eos> How did you-
I just figured you were out being Mr. Cool.<eos> Not exactly, sugar.<eos> One reason we're in this trouble is because of what I was doing.<eos> I tried to tell you this before.<eos> You're scaring me, baby.<eos> Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it.<eos> The good side is that I knew your daddy. Clyde was a good guy.<eos> You knew my daddy?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I sure did.
It wouldn't have been that easy.<eos> I wanted to save us a cross-examination. Oh, bullshit.<eos> You were embarrassed to take me there, weren't you?<eos> Nora, that's not true.<eos> There's nothing I hate more than being lied to.<eos> I'd rather have a man beat me up.<eos> At least then you stand a chance of defending yourself.<eos> You know, every time we have a date... and you show up on time... I'm so damn grateful, it's downright sickening.<eos> Because I don't expect you to show up at all.<eos> But you do.
I was putting on my lipstick.<eos> That's all right. Good color... your lipstick.<eos> And I love your sweater.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Listen, I'll just leave you alone here.<eos> You can smoke. Larry smokes like a chimney.<eos> So... you live in St. Louis?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You work in town?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Bomb was amateur night.<eos> You can pick up that stuff from any hardware store.<eos> Radicals in the '60s used to build them, but those guys aren't around anymore.<eos> But Sullivan was on to that Blue Paradise story.<eos> Maybe he...<eos> - ...crossed a drug dealer or two?<eos> - Ah...<eos> I need his notes.<eos> They're in his file-a-data and that went up in the blast.<eos> No, it didn't.
It matters if you believe any of that old fool's mumbo jumbo.<eos> Real life is scary enough.<eos> You mean, you never hexed an enemy or bought a love potion for your friend with the knife?<eos> - I don't need love potions.<eos> - Paloma, I told you to stay indoors.<eos> - Tía, I can take care of myself.<eos> - Everything's okay, Mrs. Tomarquin.<eos> You're in no position to judge.<eos> I thought you were one of her favorite customers.<eos> Yeah, so did I.
PREMINGER: Celia, what's happening?<eos> I heard a shot.<eos> What are you doing with the mask?<eos> Just get away from me, Ted.<eos> Just be smart and let it go.<eos> I can't.<eos> I worked too hard to bring it here.<eos> So did I. Just get out of my way.<eos> I don't wanna hurt you.<eos> Then don't.
I don't know.<eos> We'd better check it out, huh?<eos> Come on.<eos> This time you lose, old man!<eos> Tonight... we finish it.<eos> Jack?<eos> Dad?<eos> You kids park out here, you're just asking for trouble.<eos> Good thing you folks came along. Anybody get a good look at them?<eos> I did.
Now get home and wait for me.<eos> See to the boy, Doc.<eos> I'll have these folks run Penny home.<eos> That all right with you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You want to come inside?<eos> Dad?<eos> Too bad the old lady wasn't here. He could have saved his side cars.<eos> Looks like the town hasn't changed a bit, huh?<eos> Places like this never do.
Great.<eos> By the way, did you hear about Ruth?<eos> She found Heather.<eos> Oh, yeah, I know.<eos> Nice to hear of a happy ending now and then.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah.<eos> I'll see you soon. Bye.<eos> Curious Goods.<eos> Jack! Hey, how's the trip going?<eos> As a matter of fact, I did.
I GOT THAT LETTER FROM RUSTY.<eos> HE'S IN LOVE WITH ME. NO WAY!<eos> I LOVE D.J., AND SHE LOVES ME. WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE,<eos> AND WHERE'S MY REAL FAMILY?<eos> H-H-H-H-HOLD IT.<eos> HOLD IT.<eos> EVERYBODY JUST KNOCK IT OFF.<eos> NOW, SOMEBODY WROTE THAT LETTER<eos> AND I WANNA KNOW WHO IT IS RIGHT NOW. I KNOW WHO.<eos> YOU DO?
This baby.<eos> Where did this baby come from?<eos> This is Tony Kagan from across the street.<eos> We're babysitting him tonight.<eos> [CRIES]<eos> What did you say?<eos> You want your Uncle Jesse?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> JESSE: Kid, trust me, you want nothing to do with me.<eos> - No, no, no, you don't.
Lay it on me.<eos> - Okay, here it is.<eos> "Bill is throwing a party.<eos> He wants to buy a pound and a half of mixed nuts.<eos> One third is almonds, two thirds are walnuts.<eos> The total cost is $7.50.<eos> The almonds cost $4.00 a pound. How much do the walnuts cost?"<eos> The guy's name was Bill?<eos> Who wants to play with the munchkin?<eos> I do.
Tell her who the good-looking stud is who has all the neighbourhood women shaving their moustaches.<eos> It can't be.<eos> I'm going outside.<eos> There's gotta be someone else out there.<eos> What did they say about me?<eos> Well, they said you had the arms of a blacksmith and the legs of a god.<eos> - Did they say anything about my butt?<eos> I was bending over a lot out there.<eos> Did anyone notice? Did they?<eos> Did they?
When are you and Mlle. Stanton going to get married?<eos> Soon, I hope.<eos> - Look Mr. Poirot, can I speak freely?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - I am going to be candid with you.<eos> - Excéllent.<eos> - I know a bit more than Freda does, you see.<eos> - Indeed?<eos> She believes her uncle to be innocent.<eos> - And you don't?
- Full impulse. Aye, Commander.<eos> - Engage.<eos> I hope you're satisfied, Picard.<eos> You've accomplished nothing!<eos> The sound of your voice is beginning to anger me.<eos> Well...<eos> I think this charade has gone far enough.<eos> - Don't you?<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.
In fact, I'm delighted you're going.<eos> It's just that the choice of where you're going could stand some scrutiny.<eos> If you wish to believe that my going home is a result of being captured by the Borg, be my guest.<eos> Is that what you believe?<eos> I hate it when you do that.<eos> Captain.<eos> You do need time.<eos> You cannot achieve complete recovery so quickly.<eos> It's normal, after what you've been through, to spend a great deal of time trying to find yourself again.<eos> And what better place to do it than in one's home village?
A dynamic atmospheric disturbance of great intensity.<eos> Disturbance?<eos> The vortex.<eos> They must have been trying to reach me.<eos> But how do I find it?<eos> Wesley, where do I go?<eos> Help me.<eos> Stable threshold. They've been trying to create a stable threshold.<eos> Where are they trying to do it?<eos> Where did they do it the first time?
Continuing repairs.<eos> Where did you come from?<eos> We didn't pick up any other Federation ships.<eos> What's the last thing you remember?<eos> We were answering the distress signal.<eos> - Distress signal?<eos> - You must have heard it.<eos> From the Klingon outpost.<eos> Narendra III.<eos> But you didn't... did you?
Then come to covered in bruises and crushed fruit, and strangers standing over me waiting to see if I was dead.<eos> You see, people want terrible things to happen to you, I know.<eos> I wanna talk to you about my sperms.<eos> Sperms?<eos> You know, that is all men think about.<eos> You know, I remember when little Carl was first born and they laid him out on my breast,<eos> I looked down and saw what kind of a tiny little creature I was dealing with.<eos> And I thought to myself, I thought, 'My God, just what the world needs, another sperm gun running around loose.<eos> Right? Women beware.'<eos> Well, I did.
I've got my job and my apartment.<eos> And I just miss having a life of my own.<eos> So I think I'll probably be driving back home tomorrow.<eos> Tomorrow?<eos> Well, we are going to miss you very much.<eos> But we also understand completely.<eos> - You do?<eos> We do.<eos> - We do.<eos> Yes, we do.
- I made it.<eos> OK?<eos> Um...<eos> Uh...<eos> Here.<eos> - (gunshot)<eos> - Ah!<eos> Oops.<eos> The building is a symbol of the music industry,... ..a business where anything can happen.<eos> And usually does.
You leave me at the altar.<eos> That was my state of mind at the time.<eos> You went off with Jamie to seek your fortune and you were coming back to marry me.<eos> Am I remembering this correctly?<eos> If not, correct me.<eos> You get lost in your plane.<eos> Reported missing, presumed dead.<eos> I attend your memorial service, and cried the tears of a grieving widow.<eos> I vow I'll never get over you.<eos> In fact, I never do.
And it begins on a rainy night a little over a year ago.<eos> Our hero, Sherman McCoy, was about to make a simple phone call.<eos> But despite the existence of 11 phones and seven different lines in the 14 rooms of his $6-million-plus apartment this was a phone call he could not make at home.<eos> What on earth are you doing?<eos> I'm taking the dog for a walk.<eos> You're not taking "the dog" for a walk, you're taking "Marshall."<eos> Marshall has a name.<eos> He's family. And, anyway it's raining.<eos> I know that.<eos> So does Marshall.
That's called sticker shock.<eos> You want me to get some oxygen?<eos> Sticker shock? I know what I can afford.<eos> I just don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You're a hell of a driver, Mr. Klopstock. Are you ready to take this baby home?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We're doing pretty good.<eos> We moved 15 units... but we can do better, so I'm gonna allow $500... off the buy-back without prior approval.<eos> Jackie, how many cars I do?
What?<eos> They're only children.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To school.<eos> Why can't I go, too?<eos> You're not old enough.<eos> And it gives you a headache.<eos> It doesn't!
Let's go to Atlantic City.<eos> I'll show you how to gamble.<eos> - How will I know what numbers to bet?<eos> - Do I look like a loser?<eos> Well...<eos> Spooky-looking guy there.<eos> - What's a guy like that doing here?<eos> - That's Joey Zasa's bulldog.<eos> - You know him?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
I'm crazy enough to kill both of you.<eos> Karen, take it easy.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Do you love her?<eos> Do you?<eos> - Do you?<eos> - Karen...<eos> I love you. You know I love you.<eos> You don't.<eos> No, you don't.
Worthy enough to get me stuck in a Cuban jail?<eos> Yes.<eos> Are you some kind of fanatic?<eos> Thank you for helping.<eos> - Green Town and Country for the lady.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - I'd like to see you again.<eos> - I told you. I'm married.<eos> No, you didn't.
They weren't.<eos> Look, he wouldn't empty his pockets!<eos> What prompted you to search him?<eos> He's a fucking junkie!<eos> It's obvious.<eos> He's jumpy, fidgety, talking fast.<eos> Why did you hit him, Van?<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> OK, I did.
In the meantime, stay out. Go on. All right.<eos> Quiet, you hear me? Quiet.<eos> No!<eos> Rachel!<eos> Let go!<eos> Just what I need.<eos> Please, let him go.<eos> Let him go!<eos> How the hell do you get out of here?<eos> Please, please, don't do this!
- We're out!<eos> - Matches!<eos> - Out!<eos> - Kissing hand boyar!<eos> - What's your name young fellow?<eos> - Nita Pribescu.<eos> - And where are you going?<eos> Take out a Lillie. There it is!<eos> I'll plant it back at the gate.<eos> - But, why didn't your father do it?
Ahem. Excuse me.<eos> So how long have you been catering?<eos> Oh, I just help out Rex.<eos> Actually, I spend most of my time as a street performer at the beach.<eos> - Do you do anything besides twirl?<eos> - Um, I read minds.<eos> And you thought Julius was my boyfriend?<eos> You must not be very good.<eos> I knew you were gonna say that.<eos> Really, I did.
She could come looking for you.<eos> We have to tell somebody.<eos> No.<eos> Look, we're the only family we got.<eos> We don't need anybody else.<eos> That's just the way it is.<eos> RYAN:<eos> Good morning! You know, after what happened, I thought I'd have nightmares all night, but I slept like a log.<eos> What's the matter with you guys? You both look like somebody just died.<eos> Somebody did.
Who's this?<eos> Michelle, you told a lie.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Sweeyheary, iy's noy very nice yo yell lies.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I love yhe doggy.<eos> Well, I don't.<eos> Doggy, come back.<eos> Michelle, we don't want a dog living in the house.<eos> Yes, we do.

Come on, you're still the same guy that always made me laugh.<eos> No, I am not the same guy.<eos> - Yes, you are.<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> You don't know anything about this Joey.<eos> I work in advertising, I'm raising three little girls.<eos> I have a whole new life now.<eos> Why are you getting so upset?<eos> I thought we were falling in love again.<eos> So did I.
Ta da!<eos> Stephanie, how'd you pay for that sweater?<eos> I didn't have to.<eos> The lady said I could buy now and pay later.<eos> So I took it for you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Oh, Stephanie.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - You ripped it off.<eos> No, I didn't.
I don't know.<eos> I'll do it tomorrow.<eos> Oh, you keep saying tomorrow, but you don't do it. Why not?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Howie, you write so well on these tests.<eos> What do I have to do to motivate you to do your homework?<eos> I know, it can be boring, but later in life, you'll have a job, and some parts of that may be boring. You'll have to do them, anyway.<eos> You see, doing homework is good training.<eos> It teaches us responsibility.<eos> Even Jerry Michaels does some homework once in a while.
I said, I'd like to get the device working.<eos> Why don't you give me another shot?<eos> Then I'll get out of your hair.<eos> - Listen to me, McGreever--<eos> - It's MacGyver.<eos> Whatever.<eos> You just don't get it.<eos> What we are doing here is police work.<eos> Now, sometimes the public, civilians like yourself, just don't understand what it takes to get the job done.<eos> - We don't, huh?
The DXS wants to use the rains unit to get a recon jet through their radar and shoot some pictures before Wednesday.<eos> What happens on Wednesday?<eos> We expose the plant to the United Nations Security Council.<eos> Which could save thousands of people from an agonizing death.<eos> Now, is that non-political enough for you?<eos> MAN 1 : Dave Edwards dead. I can't believe it.<eos> MAN 2: Neither can I.<eos> I don't care what Papillon says.<eos> I got into this to pay off my condo, not to get shot.<eos> None of us did.
I mean, if whoever did this is still out there, it could happen again.<eos> Yeah, well, we can forget that radio.<eos> The crash pretty much fried it.<eos> Wouldn't be enough juice in that battery to transmit very far.<eos> Listen, we've got to notify somebody, somehow.<eos> I know, Pete.<eos> The problem is, it's a three-day trek out of here.<eos> If they were photographing when they crashed, this camera ought to let us know what they were looking at.<eos> Yeah, if we had some way to develop the film.<eos> Do we?
And when they left, there was little or nothing left of my people.<eos> If they were that aggressive, why didn't the Borg attack when they could?<eos> They don't attack individually.<eos> It's not their way.<eos> When they decide to come, they'll come in force.<eos> They don't do anything piecemeal.<eos> The initial encounter was solely to gather information?<eos> Yes.<eos> How do we reason with them, let them know we're no threat?<eos> You don't.
Serving on a starship means accepting certain risks,... ..certain dangers.<eos> Did Jeremy Aster make that choice?<eos> Death and loss are an integral part of life everywhere.<eos> Leaving him on Earth would not protect him.<eos> But the Earth won't be ordered to the Neutral Zone.<eos> My command sent his mother to her death.<eos> She understood her mission and my duty.<eos> Will he?<eos> In time... and with help.<eos> Wesley Crusher does.
Now I know why you can't concentrate.<eos> - I'll do better.<eos> - OK.<eos> Warning.<eos> Resonant field applied.<eos> - What is it? What happened?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> I had it on the wrong setting.<eos> I suppose it had to happen. It usually does at this age.<eos> What usually does?
Go... talk to her.<eos> Use the ladder.<eos> That's silly, Geordi.<eos> But since you recommended it, how should I approach her?<eos> - What should I say?<eos> - "Hi, I'm Wesley Crusher."<eos> - "I'd like to talk to you."<eos> - And then what?<eos> Whatever occurs to you.<eos> - What if nothing does?
It finally died from excessive cephalic pressures.<eos> You mean...?<eos> Right.<eos> The animal's head exploded like... I think that's enough, Chief O'Brien.<eos> - l do not enjoy riddles.<eos> - You will enjoy this one.<eos> I'm in no mood for trifling or games, not today.<eos> I know how important today is for you, the anniversary of your rite of Ascension.<eos> - You know about that?<eos> - All your friends on board do.
Weren't you getting along?<eos> - Don't do that.<eos> - What?<eos> Don't do "Counsellor" Troi.<eos> - Was I?<eos> - Yes, you were.<eos> When you leave this office,...<eos> who are you?<eos> Oh, so that's how it goes.<eos> You never do.
Why?<eos> How's Andrzej?<eos> Pretty bad...<eos> But why doesn't it matter?<eos> What you said about the passport?<eos> I'm going to have an abortion, tomorrow<eos> I don't get you<eos> I'm having an abortion tomorrow<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Yes, I do
So you think they're from down there originally?<eos> Or from you know.<eos> I don't know. I think...<eos> I think they're from "you know".<eos> Someplace with similar conditions.<eos> - Cold, intense pressure.<eos> - Oh, man!<eos> Happy as hogs in a waller down there, probably.<eos> Sniff something?<eos> Did you, rat boy?
We'll have every bird circling this area.<eos> Diaz!<eos> -Do it!<eos> -I'll do it, sarge.<eos> -Diaz is gonna do it.<eos> Do it! -Diaz, no, man.<eos> -You yellow piece of shit!<eos> Be a man! -Don't do it.<eos> -Be a man! Do it!<eos> Do it!
-You yellow piece of shit!<eos> Be a man! -Don't do it.<eos> -Be a man! Do it!<eos> Do it!<eos> -Don't do it!<eos> -Do it!<eos> -Don't let him make you.<eos> -Don't do it, man!<eos> -Do it!<eos> Do it!
-Do it!<eos> -Don't let him make you.<eos> -Don't do it, man!<eos> -Do it!<eos> Do it!<eos> You fucking piece of shit, do it!<eos> -Diaz!<eos> Diaz!<eos> -Do it!<eos> Do it!
What did he say?<eos> The French Revolution was easier to swallow than Napoleon.<eos> Napoleon was a prat.<eos> He threw everything away.<eos> Napoleon liked seafood.<eos> His favourite dish was oysters Florentine.<eos> It's amazing, isn't it?<eos> Churchill liked seafood.<eos> All the great generals were keen on seafood.<eos> What did Julius Caesar like, or Hitler?
Nobody wants to kill you...<eos> What?<eos> Repeat that.<eos> - I said, nobody...<eos> - Say the words. Come on!<eos> You mean I just imagined it.<eos> I just meant it must be a mistake.<eos> A mistake? Lady...<eos> The mistake is that you think I'm making this up!<eos> No, I don't.
That will happen as they get on.<eos> No, she's all there!<eos> Too much there is the problem!<eos> I want you to understand something.<eos> My mother is a little high strung.<eos> The fact is, you would be working for me.<eos> She can say anything she likes but she can't fire you.<eos> Understand?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Yes, sir, I sure do.
Two dot.<eos> Mah jongg.<eos> You are the luckiest thing, Beulah!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I don't know how you can look at that.<eos> See it a few times, you get in it.<eos> Both your brains are fixing to evaporate.<eos> You can bring the cake now, Hoke.<eos> Don't make a mess with those peas.<eos> Do I ever?
Like a pack of kids playing soldiers.<eos> - Did you ever play any sports, Jessie?<eos> I ran the 100-yard dash with two cops behind me.<eos> Vito thought he was an athlete though.<eos> I remember having to stop your father from signing up for high school football.<eos> Before that it was the Cub Scouts.<eos> Football, fucking Cub Scouts.<eos> He had a lot of tendencies in that direction.<eos> Sounds like your son wanted to be middle class.<eos> He still does.
Where did you hear that?<eos> I hear a lot of things, Ray.<eos> A lot of things.<eos> I hear you are ruining my business with your club.<eos> I hear you don't want to go into business with me.<eos> You know, I hear all these things, Ray.<eos> And I add them up.<eos> Know what I come up with?<eos> - No.<eos> - You don't?
"No woman shall succeed in Salique land."<eos> Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze... to be the realm of France.<eos> Yet their own authors faithfully affirm... that the land Salique lies in Germany... between the floods of Sala and of Elbe.<eos> Then doth it well appear the Salique law... was not devised for the realm of France, nor did the French possess the Salique land... until 421 years after defunction of king Pharamond, idly supposed the founder of this law.<eos> King Pepin, which deposed childeric, did, as heir general, being descended of blithild, which was the daughter to king Clothair, make claim and title to the crown of France.<eos> Hugh Capet, also, who usurped the crown of Charles, the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male of the true line and stock of Charles the great, could not keep quiet in his conscience wearing the crown of France... until satisfied that fair queen Isabel, his grandmother,<eos> was lineal of the Lady Ermengare, daughter to Charles, the aforesaid duke of Lorraine, by the which marriage the line of Charles the great... was reunited to the crown of France.<eos> So it is clear as is the summer sun.<eos> All appear to hold in right and title of the female.<eos> So do the kings of France... unto this day.
O, give us leave, great king, to view the field in safety... and to dispose of their dead bodies.<eos> I tell thee truly, herald,<eos> I know not if the day be ours or no.<eos> The day is yours.<eos> Praised be god... and not our strength for it.<eos> What is this castle called... that stands hard by?<eos> They call it Agincourt.<eos> Then call we this... the field of Agincourt... fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.<eos> Your grandfather of famous memory, an't please your majesty, and your great-uncle, Edward, the black prince of Wales, as I have read in the Chronicles, fought a most brave battle here in France.<eos> They did, Fluellen.
- All right, Nicky!<eos> Diane, you take the spoon.<eos> I'll get the machine... Hold it, Szalinski.<eos> This gizmo's been blowing up fruit.<eos> And you're not trying it on my kids until you try is on something living!<eos> You know something?<eos> Maybe I should do it on myself.<eos> I'll show you how to work the machine.<eos> It's not that hard.<eos> - Do it on me.
Yeah, they insulted me. God damn drunks.<eos> You dirty whore! How could you be insulted?<eos> Asshole.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> And you better watch your mouth, soldier. All you goddamn yankees are the same.<eos> Bunch a no-good nigger-loving bastards.<eos> That's all you are.<eos> If you don't shut up right now, I'll lock you up and your friends along with you.<eos> Anyone here see anything?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I did.
Don't touch me, Sal, you big freak!<eos> I'm not about to have sex with you. Oh...<eos> Oh, Come on, Georgie... Let me make a real woman out of you, huh?<eos> Come on, Georgie, huh?<eos> You don't want that big sausage getting in your way.<eos> Let me cut it off. It's not big, Miss Pinkie.<eos> Get away from me.<eos> Yeah, think fast.<eos> Stop it. Cut it out.<eos> Don't do it. Vince!
You got me.<eos> No.<eos> I'll kill you!<eos> Fight!<eos> Get him!<eos> I'll kill you!<eos> You son-of-a-bitch!<eos> I'll kill you!<eos> Finish him off!<eos> Do it!
Look at that boy.<eos> All right.<eos> Finally, I passed the stone.<eos> It's the most excruciating thing you can have, next to giving birth.<eos> - I had a really good time tonight.<eos> - I bet you did.<eos> A lot of guys would feel threatened by a woman always wanting to pay.<eos> - What?<eos> - Your babysitter told me.<eos> - He did, did he? - Yeah.
Oh, no, they're just traveling through.<eos> Been in the program a while, bill?<eos> You might say that.<eos> How long?<eos> Well, since 1935.<eos> 1935?<eos> I didn't know it went back that far.<eos> You must've known some early members.<eos> Matter of fact...<eos> Yes, he did.
Why is he so high-strung?<eos> He´s like a poodle.<eos> Everything´s blown out of proportion.<eos> Where does he get this obsessive behavior?<eos> I wish I knew.<eos> They´re gonna put him in Special Ed.<eos> What´d you think?<eos> That you´d dress up like a cowboy and coach Little League... and Kevin would be fine?<eos> I mean, no, I didn´t.<eos> Yeah, yeah, okay, I did.
On the holidays, they get... like, $1 to $2 bonus here and there.<eos> If you're doing this every day, isn't your arm filled with needle marks?<eos> They only keep it in one certain spot.<eos> You keep it right there.<eos> Doesn't look bad.<eos> I take some rubbing alcohol to get the scar tissue to heal up.<eos> Can we see it?<eos> I only do it in my right arm.<eos> It's not so bad.<eos> They only do it in a certain place, in a certain spot.
I'll never make another mistake like I made with Oliver.<eos> Let's just concentrate on the job at hand.<eos> She wants the house.<eos> You want the house.<eos> - l'm the one who's living in a hotel room!<eos> - Not for long.<eos> - She claims she found the house.<eos> - She did find it, right?<eos> Yeah, but that's not the point. She says she made it what it is.<eos> She didn't. She didn't.
They can take the position from you.<eos> I don't know, they can whip you.<eos> People turn their back on you.<eos> Everything happens to everybody.<eos> And you ain't gonna find nothing in your pocket that can stave it off!<eos> Nothing can stave it off!<eos> Pain.<eos> Affliction.<eos> We say, "power."<eos> Power doesn't do it.
Is this what you wanna be the rest of your life?<eos> Why are you doin' this?<eos> Can you tell me that?<eos> Why are you doin' this to yourself?<eos> - Are you gonna answer me?<eos> - Please, don't do that.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Don't do that.<eos> I wanna ask a few questions, like why do you tape women talkin' about sex?<eos> Why do you do that?
Unbelievable.<eos> My piece this morning was no exaggeration as you can see, Mr O'Connor.<eos> Miss Prentice. If you can produce a really life-like version by tomorrow, I'll print it with a new article from Mr Bates here.<eos> - How life-like?<eos> - Draw it from life, Miss Prentice.<eos> Draw it from life.<eos> It's still fiction, Mr Lees.<eos> There's no Dr Jekyll, there's no Mr Hyde.<eos> - They don't exist.<eos> - But the actor does.
You're always in trouble.<eos> Yeah, but even on the alf scale,<eos> This one's a humdinger.<eos> I need help !<eos> What happened ?<eos> Long story short -- I saw a burglar and scared him away.<eos> Now, i'm trapped, and i'm scared !<eos> Oh, the irony of it all. Can't you make a run for it ?<eos> I take it you didn't see the end of "butch cassidy" either.<eos> No, i didn't.
Did those words come out of my mouth?<eos> Kimmy, how can you compare shopping to having our very own horse?<eos> Come on, say it with me.<eos> We're gonna get a horse.<eos> - We're gonna get a horse.<eos> - We're gonna get a horse.<eos> We're gonna get a horse.<eos> We're gonna get a horse.<eos> Stephanie, you didn't hear that.<eos> Of course I did.
Save the dolphins!<eos> What do we do?<eos> We can't deploy them. They're all under the rigging.<eos> We don't wanna hurt anybody.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Save the dolphins!<eos> Save the dolphins!<eos> Save the dolphins!<eos> They're leaving!<eos> We did it, we did it!
To leave the planet Better than I found it<eos> Do not weep for me<eos> Do not weep for me For I have loved<eos> And been loved<eos> By parents<eos> Brothers, sisters<eos> By those I loved who loved me back<eos> For I never knew a stranger Only friends<eos> Do not weep for me<eos> Do not
"Who's gonna take care of me?<eos> Who's gonna look after me?"<eos> Did you ever stop to think there are other people in this world besides you?<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You're not crippled.<eos> Oh, I know you're crippled.<eos> How could I forget it?<eos> You talk about it all the time.<eos> You know how many handicapped people there are in this country?<eos> Do you?
- Morning, Minnie.<eos> - Oh, morning, doc.<eos> - Hear you've been feeling poorly.<eos> - You heard wrong.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Well, when you have some time, my bunions have been acting up again.<eos> Let me deal with the little emergencies first, Minnie, and then we'll get to the life-threatening ones like yours.<eos> This fella's with me.<eos> He's a brain surgeon.<eos> Well, how we doing, Gloria?
No, I have some math left to do.<eos> Well, do it or you won't play for the Minnows.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Look, I had to tell you, I'm on your team.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah, I quit my dad's team.<eos> - I couldn't play for him anymore.<eos> - He let you play for us?<eos> No, but my mom--<eos> Well, my stepmom did.
What a car.<eos> I can't wait to drive it.<eos> Oh, come on, Al.<eos> Stop sulking and get on in here.<eos> Wow!<eos> It's so rad!<eos> How long is he going to be able to do that?<eos> Well, we're not really sure, but don't give him any water.<eos> Okay, kids who wants to go for a ride in the car?<eos> I do!
They were accurate about everyone I tested with.<eos> Including myself.<eos> You?<eos> I thought nothing could frighten a Klingon warrior.<eos> Only fools have no fear.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm asking too many personal questions.<eos> It is very difficult for me to depend on anyone for anything.<eos> But especially for my life.<eos> On the Enterprise, you do that every day.
Man: hey, tanners, it's me!<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Pig out-Us interrupt-Us.<eos> Oh, g-- Come on in, trevor.<eos> Oh, what's up?<eos> Eh, nothing much, and even if there was, I'm not the kind of guy that would burden you with my problems.<eos> Raquel just threw me out. Oh, trevor, i'm sorry.<eos> She called me a slob.<eos> We know.<eos> Who did?
Just like we're supposed to assume your innocence !<eos> What are you doing ?<eos> I'm just trying to spice up the proceedings.<eos> I don't want to hear any more.<eos> Case dismissed.<eos> Objection.<eos> Sustained. Figures.<eos> I want this case thrown out of court.<eos> Because i'm losing. Summaries ?<eos> Alf did it.No, i didn't.
One with a big-Screen tv.<eos> I'm sorry. But you're the one who wanted a trial.<eos> I also thought justice would triumph.<eos> But i was wrong -- I'm being punished for a crime i didn't commit.<eos> You really didn't do it, did you.<eos> No. You believe me, don't you ?<eos> Of course i do.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I wish i had a better lawyer.<eos> Oh, you did fine.
Shoot the dopey bastard!<eos> You shot Walter!<eos> Yeah. It was all I could think of to save his life.<eos> - By shooting him?<eos> - I only nicked him.<eos> - Now we're all on foot.<eos> That's even.<eos> - Seven to two is even?<eos> I thought you two were mates.<eos> So did I.
Asshole.<eos> I can take the abuse as long as I don't have to walk.<eos> You guys got room in there for all of me?<eos> Get in the back.<eos> Thanks. You know, hitch is fun.<eos> It's the hiking part that sucks.<eos> Massachusetts sucks too, huh?<eos> Come to think of it, just about every place sucks.<eos> Hey, you guys believe in ghosts?<eos> - No. - Well, I do.
You'll wait right here for the officer to come and get you.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Moral support.<eos> Saw Whitewood having breakfast with Anderson.<eos> Seemed in a good mood.<eos> Good luck, Sarah.<eos> Sarah Tobias?<eos> Please come in.<eos> Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
You're not like all the others. You're worse.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I'm not like that.<eos> OK?<eos> Are you scared?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Your Honour, The People call Kenneth Joyce.<eos> Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Listen to what I have to say!<eos> He saved me!<eos> Twice!<eos> Maybe it was just to get close to us.<eos> The guy who was in that accident in the old city is a friend of mine!<eos> I know it's hard to believe, but it's the truth!<eos> I was there when it happened!<eos> Don't they say the only foolish questions are unasked ones?<eos> Huh?<eos> They don't?
- You're not staying for dinner?<eos> - No, my mum has made macaroni. - Bye Mr. Visser.<eos> - Bye Willie, say hello to your aunt.<eos> - I will, see you tomorrow Anneke.<eos> - How did it go at school?<eos> - Alright.<eos> - Did you buy some peanut butter?<eos> - Is it out?<eos> That's what you asked yesterday.<eos> So why don't you do the shopping from now on?
How I live and who I marry...<eos> Of course, that's falling apart now, so we don't have to worry about it.<eos> She wants me to work for Cousin Andrew.<eos> But she's right, because I never have supported her and the kids properly.<eos> Well, would that be so awful?<eos> Working for Andrew?<eos> You used to say that.<eos> I know. I know I did, but...<eos> - Times change.<eos> - Yeah, they certainly do.
-That's your decision then?<eos> -lt has to be.<eos> You disappear heroically so I can return to my life, reputation intact?<eos> That's it.<eos> Who the hell do you think you are?<eos> -What?<eos> -Who do you think you are?<eos> A man who kills people for money.<eos> Governments want me dead. The Canadians want me dead.<eos> Carlos does too.
- She's not here. But come in.<eos> I'd like to talk to you.<eos> Sit down.<eos> I've certainly heard a lot about you in the last couple of days.<eos> I don't know what really happened between the two of you, but... I must say, you've got a lot of nerve coming up here after what you did to Jordan.<eos> I understand that, and I realize that Jordan is very upset.<eos> But if I could talk to her, make her see that I'm gonna stick by her through this...<eos> I hope you're not suggesting that you'll marry her.<eos> I'm not sure what we're gonna do. We have a lot to talk about...<eos> The hell you do!
Take it easy.<eos> They won't come into a bar, would they?<eos> They don't drink whiskey.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Spirits.<eos> How the hell would I know?<eos> - The Irish ones do.<eos> - He says the Irish ones do.<eos> - Don't.<eos> - Now, what, do they or don't they?
Don't!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Please!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Please stop it!<eos> Ka-kui, are you hurt?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> So you want to play the hero?<eos> Now it's your turn.<eos> Please don't!
So go and buy them from the newspaper,<eos> I don't have any eggs, you can search my shop,<eos> Mr. Altman, I want the bill please.<eos> Why don't you turn this thing off?<eos> It doesn't cool at all, it only drills a hole in my head.<eos> Henya, why does everything bother you?<eos> Good day, sir!<eos> I'll be right with you.<eos> This is Mr. Gantz, our new neighbor.<eos> How do you do?
Get up!<eos> Did you smile that same stupid smile, huh?<eos> !<eos> Did ya?<eos> ! You... (crashing from inside)<eos> Did ya smile, Pell?<eos> Did ya smile?<eos> !<eos> Huh?<eos> ! Did ya?

Surely.<eos> It was very pleasant. But I hope that's not all you want to do.<eos> Remember me?<eos> You're so wonderful.<eos> You're funny, you're intelligent and you understand my work and now you want to have sex.<eos> I wanna have sex?<eos> Don't you?<eos> Do you?<eos> Yes!<eos> Well, I do, too.
Steve Mills.<eos> You look like a reasonable bunch of superbeings.<eos> We really have to work this out.<eos> I'm in love with your Chief Extragalactic Probist.<eos> What do you mean, no?<eos> We need someone to tell us about your war and making love and all your fuzziness.<eos> Excuse me Big Thing in the Sky you need someone to tell you about making love?<eos> We need someone to tell us about everything.<eos> Does anyone up there look as good as she does?<eos> Everyone does.
I wanna talk to you.<eos> Let's just go outside.<eos> Dirtbag.<eos> - So what happened, Jo? - I don't know.<eos> I just, you know...<eos> I just...<eos> When I actually got up there to do it,<eos> I just couldn't, Bill. I just couldn't.<eos> Bill, it's not that I don't love you.<eos> Because I do, Bill.
Please!<eos> The attempt on Nordberg's life left me shaken and disturbed.<eos> The questions kept coming up again and again, like bubbles in a case of soda.<eos> Who was this character in the hospital?<eos> Why was he trying to kill Nordberg... and for whom?<eos> Did Ludwig lie to me?<eos> I didn't have any proof, but somehow, I didn't entirely trust him.<eos> Why was the "I Luv You" not listed in Ludwig's records?<eos> If it was, did he know about it?<eos> If he didn't, who did?
Here we go.<eos> You mountain men do this kind of shit a lot?<eos> Every damn day.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, you all right?<eos> That arm--<eos> - Let's push on.<eos> - No.<eos> No, you-- you need some more rest.<eos> - No, I don't.
Keep it on or I'll beat your lights!<eos> I've got such a headache!<eos> Number Johnny Five, I was so worried.<eos> Pardon me.<eos> See this guy? I know him.<eos> Fast reader.<eos> Close personal friend of mine.<eos> Here's a guy that can read.<eos> You want my toys?<eos> Everybody does.
Did you ever meet her?<eos> - You don't say much, do you, Wyatt?<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> Also, it's Mr. Earp. Or Marshal, or even Earp.<eos> Not Wyatt until I tell you.<eos> And while I think of it don't ever question me again.<eos> Just trying to be friendly.<eos> You're trying to stay ahead of the game.<eos> Your boss's wife wants to talk to me, you want to know why.<eos> Probably your boss does too.
They're educated and they're good in business.<eos> John, I don't know how to break this to you, but you'll never get in the B'nai B'rith.<eos> You're black. Don't you know how Jews feel about blacks?<eos> They hate you! They see you schwartzes on the street, they cross to the other side.<eos> You know those slums in south Dallas where the rats eat babies for breakfast?<eos> Jews own those slums! What do you mean, I love Jews?<eos> Are you some kind of Uncle Tom?<eos> What the hell you know about Uncle Tom? I think brotherhood...<eos> I don't care what you think!<eos> No one does!
I'll just have some Herradura.<eos> Your boy lives with you?<eos> - That depends.<eos> - On what?<eos> Money and his mama's mood.<eos> Haven't you had enough?<eos> You want to hear if Cody wakes up and needs something, don't you?<eos> You won't answer me?<eos> I don't think you really want me to.<eos> Yes, I do.
- You know what I really love about Vince ?<eos> - What ?<eos> He's a force of nature.<eos> - You're outta control.<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> That poetry he pretends to write, they're old song lyrics.<eos> I know.<eos> Geez, you think I don't know that !<eos> - I don't think you know that.<eos> - Well, I do.
See, they told her you had died at birth.<eos> Who told her we died ?<eos> Mitchell Traven, the guy with the clipboard.<eos> He supervised the experiment for the government.<eos> He still runs a genetics lab at Los Alamos, New Mexico.<eos> I'll have to pay him a visit.<eos> Watch out for him.<eos> He's kind of a dickhead, if you know what I mean.<eos> Dickhead ?<eos> No, I don't.
I think you want a drink.<eos> - How 'bout it, Judge?<eos> - Well, why not.<eos> I don't mind prolonging the execution.<eos> Happy trails.<eos> No, thanks, Eddie. I'm tryin' to cut down.<eos> - Drink the drink!<eos> - But I don't want the drink.<eos> He doesn't want the drink. - He does!<eos> You do! - I don't!
Happy trails.<eos> No, thanks, Eddie. I'm tryin' to cut down.<eos> - Drink the drink!<eos> - But I don't want the drink.<eos> He doesn't want the drink. - He does!<eos> You do! - I don't!<eos> - I don't! I don't! - You do!<eos> - You do! You don't.<eos> - I don't! - I do!<eos> - You don't!
Quite. Pulled the poor wretch to the bottom.<eos> Struggling futilely, flailing desperately as the cold, black water sealed his fate forever.<eos> Well, it's certainly been a laugh.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> We must be off.<eos> Pleasure meeting you, Mr. Mayor.<eos> The same, Doctor.<eos> Now... now...<eos> We know for a fact that Giles was on the boat.<eos> No, we don't. Oh.
Certain enough to be judge, jury and executioner?<eos> You're just pissed because your marbles got knocked out of the game.<eos> And I'm not even sure which came first.<eos> Ben.<eos> I got a job to do.<eos> So do I.<eos> The last witness for the defense is Mr. Hobart Jackson.<eos> Please raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.<eos> Unless it's somehow been misfiled.<eos> - Misfiled?<eos> - Yes, misfiled.<eos> Sometimes somebody puts a document in the wrong file and then it's misfiled. It makes it much harder to find.<eos> Who?<eos> Who?<eos> What do you mean? Who?<eos> - I don't know who exactly.<eos> - You don't?
we're not interested in a 7-hour drive.<eos> you can fly there in 1 hour.<eos> sure, but who can afford it?<eos> i'll fly you there for nothing.<eos> my friend lets me borrow his plane on weekends.<eos> you're a pilot?<eos> yeah, i flew in korea.<eos> over inchon, i took some commie flak in my ribs.<eos> you want to see the scar?<eos> no, please-- how ya doing, kate?
What are you doing?<eos> Nothing, I'm just giving Dunn his big chance.<eos> You can't fight him.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because somebody might get hurt.<eos> Yeah, I'm going to wipe up the floor with him.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Now, I know that you guys think that Dunn killed Manny.<eos> Well, so do I!
Thank you, Sandman Express.<eos> And the Sandman Express runs every night.<eos> If I get on now, will you drop me off at the nearest hotel?<eos> Okay, let's say good night.<eos> - All right.<eos> Good night, junior babes.<eos> - Uncle Jesse, tell us a bedtime story.<eos> Uncle Jesse doesn't know any bedtime stories.<eos> Yes, he does.<eos> - No, he doesn't.

All we do is argue.<eos> I'm telling you, it's always the same.<eos> Tony, Tony.<eos> I mean, doesn't he know that I love my brother as much as he does?<eos> Then why don't you go see him?<eos> Michele, if you'd just visit Tony, then maybe your dad would have some time for himself and for your mother.<eos> I'm telling you, it's hopeless.<eos> He doesn't feel anything, he doesn't know anything, he doesn't remember anything.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Now, you want to go to the prom, or not?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Me too.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Hey, can you give me a minute?<eos> - Why?<eos> I gotta take some socks out of my shoes.<eos> Stop it.<eos> - How you doing tonight, Mr. Smith?
Thank you for everything.<eos> Listen, next time you come back, you won't have to work this hard either, I promise.<eos> How's he doing, Joe?<eos> He's all cried out, I think.<eos> Is it all right if I go upstairs and say goodbye to him?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I won't be long, Mark.<eos> Hi, Stevie.<eos> Amazing Man?<eos> How you doing tonight?
David, you surprised me.<eos> I can't get used to the idea of you being home in the middle of the day.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Nothing.<eos> What does it look like I'm doing?<eos> Nothing.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means nothing.<eos> Nothing means nothing.<eos> Nothing does.
After all, you've only been here one day, Gordon.<eos> Hardly enough time to understand the criminal justice system.<eos> Look, I was a cop for 20 years.<eos> I know the system.<eos> Believe me, I have seen the lowest of the low.<eos> People who should be locked up and never see the light of day again.<eos> But a lot of the women in this prison are mothers.<eos> So we are dealing with women and children here.<eos> To me that should make a difference in the way we treat them.<eos> Not to me, it doesn't.
Free Santa!<eos> This court is now ready to hear whatever witnesses you choose to call.<eos> But I must warn you, Mr. Burke, that this court will not be swayed by sentiment.<eos> And Christmas Eve or no Christmas Eve, if this man is Santa Claus, you're gonna have to prove it to me.<eos> Your Honour, I find myself in the rather absurd position of having to disprove a myth.<eos> Now, Mr. Burke and Mr. Smith may call various members of the clergy or what have you in their attempt to verify their claim of the reality of this myth.<eos> I, however, have turned to the world of empirical evidence in calling to the stand the foremost psychiatrist in the state,<eos> Dr. Carl Erhardt.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth in the matter now pending before this court?<eos> I do.
It's not your arm.<eos> Next batter!<eos> That's Hank Aaron!<eos> Pitcher never knows who he's gonna face.<eos> He's a pal of the coach's, and he's here to give out batting tips.<eos> So, have a good time.<eos> Blow it right past him.<eos> Let's go, kid. Let me see what you got there.<eos> Right over the plate, Dave, right over the plate. Throw it by him, Dave.<eos> Do your stuff, Hank.
Death is a guarantee from the day we're born.<eos> But somehow you forget about it, figure it'll never happen, at least not to you or the people you care about.<eos> But it does.
I got a letter of commendation from the State Department about that case.<eos> Well, send me a copy one of these days, Pete.<eos> Maybe I can get a raise.<eos> Speaking of letters, Pete, do you have that letter of resignation for me?<eos> - You really serious about that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's on my desk.<eos> Bud tells me you're his best friend.<eos> Then maybe you know what's eating him.<eos> Yeah, Harry, I do.
The way I figure it, if I can make it through a night like this,<eos> - I must be in pretty good shape.<eos> - Like I told you, Harry, you're gonna go on forever.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> But I'm gonna make that hockey game.<eos> Harry!<eos> Are you sure you can't stay a Iittle longer?<eos> - I gotta get back home.<eos> - What's the rush?<eos> A Iot of things to do.
But I guess if you're hearing this, you've gotten tired of playing old man of the mountain.<eos> Pete and I left messages for you at Ellard's store... but I suppose you don't get out much.<eos> Anyway... I know this is tough for you, and I want you to know I'm here if you want to talk, okay?<eos> Call me.<eos> We miss you.<eos> But I only miss once.<eos> Mac, how you doing?<eos> It's your old buddy, Jack Dalton.<eos> I missed you at the funeral.<eos> Everybody did.
Now, they've never won a game because they refuse to steal, but they've never played us.<eos> Dad, the refrigerator's been sucked dry.<eos> Who's this?<eos> It's Brian.<eos> Nice to meet you, Brian.<eos> Yeah, nice to meet you, Brian.<eos> Hi.<eos> Your breath smells of juice.<eos> Oh, don't pay any attention to Al.<eos> No one ever does.
No, I think you oughta hear this in person.<eos> Stay where you are.<eos> Oh, don't leave me.<eos> - Wha-What's she doing here?<eos> - Never mind her.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I put in some overtime on the computer, and get this:<eos> The Lindstrom case is a fraud.<eos> - I know that.<eos> - You do?
Oh, by the way, does the, uh, Russian woman know any of the names on the list?<eos> - No.<eos> - Good.<eos> We've got to be certain that she never finds out.<eos> Some of my associates on the list are getting nervous.<eos> I've worked too hard for my position to be jeopardized by my second career coming to light.<eos> Just get those reports and there won't be any problems.<eos> If you take care of this, you could have a very enviable career.<eos> But Christina Golitsyn has got to be found and dealt with now or there won't be anything left for either of us.<eos> Done.
Wes.<eos> Are you aware that you are behaving strangely, that a kind of infection was brought over from the Tsiolkovsky, which acts like... intoxication?<eos> Are you saying that's why I feel so hot?<eos> So strange?<eos> That's...<eos> That's a very adult bit of reasoning, Wesley.<eos> So, you mean I'm drunk!<eos> I feel strange, but also good.<eos> Because... you have lost the capacity for self-judgement.<eos> Now, alcohol does this, Wesley.
My God!<eos> Look at this.<eos> They've got spiced lard, liver paste, meatballs, chocolate shortcake margarine, eggs, cheese.<eos> They've got everything!<eos> Brian's mother couldn't believe her eyes.<eos> - What did you send her?<eos> - Tin of ham, sausages. Tinned fruit, plums, raspberries.<eos> "Rahzberries." Don't you love that!<eos> A whole country says "rahzberries!"<eos> They sure do, ma'am!
When she caught my eye<eos> Standing all alone<eos> Looking sad and shy<eos> We began to dance<eos> Swayin' to and fro whoa, whoa<eos> And soon I knew I'd never let her go<eos> Blame it on the bossa nova<eos> With its magic spell<eos> Blame it on the bossa nova<eos> That she did so well
Just eat a fig for me. You can have a little wine afterwards.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Come on, do it for me.<eos> - Stop it.<eos> Take a big bite out of it. - I don't want one.<eos> - Eat the fig.<eos> - God damn it.<eos> Eat it! - You're hurting me!<eos> Why did you do that?
God damn, that's a big bitch.<eos> - Who is that man?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> He's got a.44 auto mag casing from here.<eos> I saw.<eos> You sure it's ours?<eos> - I made a whole bunch for Mr Cain.<eos> - You didn't tell him that, did you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Don't.
Stop the bullshit, Lowry.<eos> You borrowed $40,000 from us yesterday and you lost it.<eos> Now, that makes $640,000 you owe us.<eos> Now, when do I see the money?<eos> Luis, you don`t understand.<eos> I don`t gamble because I want to.<eos> With me, gambling is a disease.<eos> People die from that disease, Lowry.<eos> Do you know what I mean?<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
What's your name?<eos> James Graham.<eos> I'm writing a book on contract bridge.<eos> Are you with the American fleet?<eos> American fleet?<eos> It looks like you almost lost your shirt.<eos> Maybe I'll help you find your parents;<eos> I know just the man.<eos> Do you know General Winter?<eos> My father does.
Sanchez, call the coroner.<eos> See if he can come sometime today.<eos> That way over there.<eos> How tall would you say he was?<eos> What does this have to do with you?<eos> You're out of line.<eos> The guy you want is dead.<eos> Your job is done.<eos> I suggest you take the next flight to Seattle.<eos> How we doing here?
The point being, no killing.<eos> - No killing, right.<eos> - Right.<eos> Piece of cake.<eos> Now I'm happy.<eos> Read him his rights. I'll stand here being happy.<eos> He's got a gun!<eos> You ever met anybody you didn't kill?<eos> Well, I haven't killed you yet.<eos> Don't do me no favors.
- Not yet.<eos> I advise you to go to your brother's place and check it out.<eos> Why? The police will search his place.<eos> - He was here during the murder.<eos> - No matter, they'll hassle him.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'll be back tomorrow.<eos> Remove anything suspicious - photos, postcards, drugs, notes...<eos> - You know what I mean.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
- Oh, boy, what?<eos> - You're fucked.<eos> OK, 86, wake up.<eos> You're gonna block the line.<eos> - Yeah, where you going?<eos> - Chicago.<eos> - Chicago?<eos> - Chicago.<eos> You know you're in St Louis?<eos> Yes, I do.
- I really don't care.<eos> Everybody, run!<eos> I can't get anybody's approval for the extra two trucks!<eos> Tucker, what're you gonna do about it?<eos> All right, look.<eos> What does a boxcar cost?<eos> The transfer sheet shows that somebody... is accumulating an enormous block of our stock.<eos> - What do you think about that, Thomas?<eos> - I think it's very encouraging.<eos> - You do, do you?
I'm sorry, Your Honor<eos> The defendant will remain handcuffed during the rest of the proceedings.<eos> - Please don't do this to me.<eos> - Your client has done it for you.<eos> Miss Riley, call your first witness.<eos> We call Dr Alan Alpert to the stand.<eos> Call Dr Alan Alpert.<eos> Raise your right hand, please.<eos> Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> - I do.
Take a look at this crap.<eos> What, the Irs?<eos> The don't want to leave me alone. Home improvement commission.<eos> Serious.<eos> What, we gotta appear?<eos> Seems to be the gist of what they're saying.<eos> Holy Christ. Well, can't we ignore it. How do they know we got the letter.<eos> It's certified.<eos> What do you think about this?<eos> I don't now.
You're an honest woman.<eos> I'm being honest with you.<eos> I like women.<eos> I admire them.<eos> But if you want me to treat you like a dumb twit, I will.<eos> But what for?<eos> You have brains.<eos> More than brains.<eos> But you don't know it.<eos> Most women don't.
Execution chamber.<eos> It's not as though we don't have ten zillion other things to do around here.<eos> Maybe he's got special plans for us.<eos> God, I could use a smoke.<eos> I could use a smoke, Hersh.<eos> Hersh?<eos> I got some smokes for ya, buddy.<eos> Some nice, long, nicotine smokes.<eos> See, one a day'll carry me through the week.<eos> Yeah, well, a helluva lot of good that does me, baby.
Can you walk?<eos> No, I can't.<eos> Let me try again.<eos> Now can you walk?<eos> Yes, I can.<eos> Can you run?<eos> No, I can't.<eos> Let me try again.<eos> Sylvia, do you love me?<eos> No, I don't.
Tuesday.<eos> Wednesday.<eos> Thursday.<eos> Friday.<eos> Saturday.<eos> Sunday.<eos> On Monday I play football.<eos> On Tuesday I play basketball.<eos> On Wednesday I go roller- skating.<eos> On Thursday I do my exercises.
I don't think you're dumb.<eos> Then you're dumb.<eos> I haven't been mean to you, Todd.<eos> Please don't be mean to me.<eos> Then--Then go away.<eos> I don't wanna do nothing.<eos> I can't do nothing and you can't make me.<eos> You're right about that, son, I can't make you.<eos> You have to want to.<eos> Well, I don't.
This is Helicopter 13 reporting. Negative on Section C-6.<eos> We're moving on to Section C-7.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Morning.<eos> - Morning.<eos> Didn't expect to see you boys back here.<eos> Well, we just wanna check on the old dog one more time.<eos> Yeah, well, he got lucky.<eos> They came by right after you left and picked him up.<eos> - They did, huh? - Well, yeah.
Is Roy here?<eos> Sure, come on in.<eos> Hello, Roy.<eos> Laura.<eos> I just want to thank you for standing up for me in front of Ted Simpson.<eos> - He made me mad, Laura.<eos> - Me too.<eos> Look, I'm sorry I lost my temper and popped him one.<eos> I think you handled it very well the way you did.<eos> You did?
In the left-hand corner.<eos> Bet you it still works.<eos> I still don't know why I missed it last night.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> You weren't analyzing for structure... you were analyzing for personnel.<eos> Feel a draft here.<eos> Abracadabra.<eos> See you later.<eos> And...<eos> How did you do that?
It's Martinez.<eos> He's one of us.<eos> Pull over.<eos> Martinez!<eos> Martinez, stop!<eos> [Lisa speaks Spanish] It's me, Lisa.<eos> Stop!<eos> Oh, Raoul.<eos> I thought they killed you.<eos> (Raoul) So did the soldiers.
Someone she may have been close to that she talked to?<eos> Well, Min moved over five years ago. And I haven't seen Toby in a good year.<eos> But what about Amy's roommate, Bonnie?<eos> Oh, yeah, we tried to contact her. She took Friday off.<eos> Probably went away for a long weekend somewhere.<eos> I don't think she knows about this. She probably won't make it back for the funeral.<eos> - When is that? - It's tomorrow morning at 10:00.<eos> It's a coroner's case.<eos> You don't have to go.<eos> Yes, sir, I do.
- What about that other man? - Alan Hackston.<eos> - What about that other man?<eos> - Alan Hackston. - Top money man for the mob out here.<eos> - You're kidding!<eos> - The mob?<eos> - In Tarzana?<eos> Frances, there's something I want to say.<eos> - I want you to know- - You don't have to say anything, Laura.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - No, you don't.
- That is not my fault.<eos> No?<eos> Who was then responsible with the previous two missions?<eos> If I had enough men ...<eos> - You had enough.<eos> And yet let you steal the silver by Robin Hood.<eos> Stupid bitch. You come both to the gallows.<eos> There is no reason to panic.<eos> - No?<eos> Why does the king Roger de Carnac than that?
- He is at the bait off.<eos> You have too many of them asked.<eos> - Too many of them asked?<eos> Do not be absurd.<eos> That is the best falcon in the country.<eos> He is somewhere in a tree.<eos> He is , just to eat at any ...<eos> Listen. Can you hear bells?<eos> No, sir.<eos> - Well, I do.
Um, I'm in Sonja Chenko's apartment and Lee and Sonja are not here.<eos> He missed his last two check-ins so I came in as backup.<eos> He said he'd be out at midnight and, well, he isn't so, I thought something was pretty wrong.<eos> You damn right there is.<eos> Why do you think I'm out of bed at 12:30 in the morning?<eos> Ok, a team of bloodhounds will be there in five minutes.<eos> I want you to leave now.<eos> Meet me back at the agency.<eos> Sir, Why don't I stay here so I can help them look for Lee?<eos> Amanda, do it now.
Well, we don't have to live in a palace, you know.<eos> I think it'd be great for the boys.<eos> Yeah, ah, you know, we have an awful lot to think about before we start talking about mortgages.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> I'm just getting excited about the possibilities.<eos> AMANDA:<eos> I know you are.<eos> Up in Rockville we can keep horses.<eos> You have any idea how much it costs to keep horses?<eos> Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.
Jackson, the side door.<eos> Smith, Allen, seal the back.<eos> Nobody in or out.<eos> Let's move it, people.<eos> We understand that your company provided health insurance for an agency project in 1962.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, it's been a while and we handle numerous government contracts but I'm sure Mr. Atkins could fill you in.<eos> He's our senior account executive.<eos> He probably handled those contracts.<eos> He did most of them in the '60s.
Don't remember seeing that in the original plans.<eos> Would've vetoed it if I had.<eos> Never liked gadgets.<eos> Hmm, everything in this place was the best money could buy from Ray Packer's lights right down to Izzy Izenstein's fancy carpet.<eos> [ALL CHUCKLE]<eos> - Nothing much changed, huh?<eos> - No, of course not.<eos> Buildings are like people, the good ones last.<eos> I'd say they do, sir.<eos> They certainly do.
- What do you mean?<eos> - Normally, when new weapons are delivered, the warheads don't fit the ends of the rockets.<eos> That's what happened to Polaris.<eos> You know the sort of thing, wiring faults, microchip failure.<eos> We couldn't fire Polaris for some years.<eos> Cruise is probably the same. Trident might be too.<eos> We should take the manufacturers to court.<eos> We can't risk the publicity - security and they know it!<eos> - We should change the manufacturers.<eos> - We do all the time.
- There's nicotine on your hands.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> All the hospitality that we've enjoyed at BTG's expense.<eos> Champagne receptions, the best seats at sporting and cultural events.<eos> - What's the problem?<eos> - The tobacco companies may tell the press. So?<eos> I've had drinks at the Soviet embassy.<eos> That doesn't make me a Russian spy.<eos> Well... Oh.<eos> - Does it?
yes, mom.<eos> [ knock, knock ] we gave at the office.<eos> did you fix the spaceship?<eos> i'm sorry.<eos> i couldn't do it. i don't have the right parts. [ knock, knock ] ball's in your court.<eos> [ knock, knock ]<eos> yes.<eos> i'm darnell valentine... with the alien task force stationed at edwards.<eos> mind if i come in?<eos> yes, i do.
Heil, Owen.<eos> Take this woman and make her your wife.<eos> Hail, lord of Clun and his lady.<eos> If they see us, they lit the signal fire.<eos> Now.<eos> You aim without looking.<eos> I know.<eos> That will not happen.<eos> You challenge my champion from.<eos> - I do indeed.
We will start again.<eos> "I continued caressing myself; my hands leveled with his eyes.<eos> He squinted slightly as he watched.<eos> She must go. We must be alone.<eos> I only look for you.<eos> "I masturbated on his face.<eos> I felt his loathing invade me-- giving me pleasure."<eos> She must die.<eos> "Want a cigarette, kid?<eos> Do you?
I said for her to be there alone and you freaked.<eos> Now, I didn't...<eos> I didn't hit you. I lightly slapped you.<eos> You hit me.<eos> Look, don't ask me to participate in your stupid crap if you don't like the way I do it.<eos> You make me get out of bed.<eos> You make me come over here.<eos> You make me make a phony phone call to Edward Rooney?<eos> The man could squash my nuts into oblivion, and then, and then, you deliberately hurt my feelings.<eos> No, I did not deliberately...
- No, the dead end is behind you.<eos> It keeps changing.<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> The only way out is to try one of these doors.<eos> One of them leads to the castle and the other one leads to certain death!<eos> - Which one is which?<eos> - We cannot tell you.<eos> Why not?<eos> - We do not know.<eos> - But they do.
It's this one right here.<eos> This one.<eos> - Lucas doesn't live here.<eos> - Yes, he does.<eos> - He lives in the trailer park.<eos> - He lives here.<eos> I've seen him here.<eos> This is just one of the houses he works at.<eos> He works for a gardener.<eos> Yeah, he does work for a gardener.
- It's good for your career.<eos> Fuck my career.<eos> I don't want to leave you alone.<eos> You'd be better off.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - Nothing's wrong.<eos> It's that woman.<eos> It can't be.<eos> You left the show together. - Don't deny it.<eos> - I don't.
Maestro, can I talk to you?<eos> - Wait in the car.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Is that from the goring?<eos> - Yes. And yours?<eos> Mine is psychological.<eos> Do you think Angel is homosexual?<eos> - What?<eos> - You knew him well, right?<eos> No, I didn't.
No, I won't hurt him.<eos> [FLUTE PLAYS]<eos> [DOOR SMASHES]<eos> FELIPE: Rodrigo!<eos> Rodrigo!<eos> Rodrigo, please.<eos> [MAN CHUCKLES]<eos> - You laughed. MAN:<eos> I did not laugh. MENDOZA:<eos> Most certainly you did. - Rodrigo, please.
I would have if I could have... ... butI couldn'tSo Ididn't.<eos> Are you talking to me?<eos> Listen, Lizzy... ... yourememberwhenyou ... ... suggestedthatIkeepyour date with your ex?<eos> well... ... Idid. And the thing is, I couldn't say no.<eos> I...<eos> ... sleptwithhim. With Bruce?<eos> My Bruce?<eos> I thought you should know.<eos> well, your mom will like him.<eos> Mine did.
Who the fuck do you think you are?<eos> Coming.<eos> Your breakfast is ready.<eos> Will that be cash or charge?<eos> Cash.<eos> John?<eos> Aren't you going to ask me how I like this?<eos> No.<eos> Did you take as good a care of the others as you do of me?<eos> Did you?
Whacking the back of my neck.<eos> Damn.<eos> It just jumped into the piano.<eos> Hi, Jacques.<eos> - Bravo.<eos> - Sorry?<eos> - The Dandy d'Or.<eos> - Ah, yes!<eos> That sounds funny.<eos> Yes, it does.
Forget about it.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> You're damn right!<eos> Jesus, Peggy, you sure know how to spoil a mood.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Save it, woman!<eos> Humiliator!<eos> I was very impressed with what you said in English class today.<eos> Gilford's okay, except that he thinks that Hemingway's great literature.<eos> And you don't?
From what we know, you don't stay anyplace too long.<eos> If you're not part of an organization that can protect you... - moving around is the next best thing.<eos> - He's looking for a home.<eos> You kill anybody, Joey?<eos> Yeah.<eos> More than one?<eos> Three.<eos> You want names and addresses?<eos> Smart, I like.<eos> Smart-ass, I don't.
May the Lord have mercy on our souls!<eos> Get that thing out of here.<eos> Maybe it cracked the main butane tank.<eos> It's up there.<eos> Go look at it.<eos> Taxes.<eos> Taxes.<eos> Damn property taxes fuck up everything.<eos> Crooks don't pay taxes.<eos> Politicians don't.
Is Antoine married? - Yes.<eos> So much so he's talking divorce.<eos> She treats him badly?<eos> She's my wife's sister.<eos> One big family.<eos> Her elder sister.<eos> That's why I want to film our story.<eos> I still haven't said yes.<eos> I still haven't said yes. - Or no.<eos> Yes, I did.
You're a very lovely lady.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> But let's get down to business, shall we.<eos> Mr. Parmentel tells me you're looking into the murder of them Italian boys.<eos> Carmine Tandino and Freddy Angelo, as well as Jamaal Washington and Michael and Darnel Nobliet.<eos> The police are putting out this story that there is a gang war going on.<eos> - Do you believe that?<eos> - What do you believe?<eos> My people didn't kill no Freddy Angelo or what's his name Tandino and cut his heart out.<eos> - Then who did?
Sorry about that.<eos> It's good.<eos> And please check the left rear tire.<eos> It's good, too.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And what can I do for you, sir.<eos> You got any more of what you had last week?<eos> I might.<eos> Well do you, or don't you?
Take her blouse off.<eos> Oh yeah, Otis, good.<eos> My oh, yeah, yeah.<eos> Skirt, skirt, skirt.<eos> Do it Otis, you're a star.<eos> Shut up!<eos> I'll do what the hell I want to do bitch!<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> Do it Otis.<eos> Do it.
No, sir!<eos> I mean, yes, sir.<eos> What is your comment on that, sir?<eos> Or do you have one?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> You will reply, "No, I don't, sir!"<eos> No, I don't, sir!<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> I know how difficult that must have been, sir... because you gentlemen from South Carolina consider yourselves... superior to the gentlemen from Georgia, do you not, sir?<eos> - No, we don't, sir! - Good, sir!
No.<eos> I'd sooner be wigless, as they know me in Vauxhall and Ranelagh.<eos> I'm repeating myself, so do we all, musicians, like the very seasons.<eos> Oh, scraps of memory, scraps of memory...<eos> I have a dry humour, they tell me, meaning that it eludes them,<eos> What places,<eos> Halle, Now there was a place to remove myself from,<eos> The continental courts, Berlin, Florence even.<eos> Did I say?<eos> I did.
Never to...<eos> Never to...<eos> Not in front of the ladies!<eos> Not!<eos> Can you not hear that raging, thunderous sound, beyond time, beyond our time?<eos> Forever!<eos> I got to England, as I swore I would, on my own bottom,<eos> But as for heaven, the diapason closing in on man, the compass of notes it ran,<eos> I know not, we know not, but the trumpet must surely sound, It must,<eos> It does,
And I'm having fun, so I know God isn't punishing me, because I'm having fun.<eos> It sure sounds great.<eos> It is great.<eos> I bet if you came up to camp, we'd be in the same bunkhouse.<eos> - You think so?<eos> - Sure.<eos> And Mark, he's gonna be our bunk counsellor.<eos> He's a funny guy.<eos> I kind of wish I could go.<eos> Then why don't you?
How come I can see through you?<eos> I'm not really back.<eos> I'm out on bail.<eos> The ruling comes down tomorrow.<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Boy, it's gonna be some day tomorrow.<eos> I know.<eos> You know what's been happening?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You promised me sunshine and good times.<eos> And I know you're gonna deliver.<eos> Aren't you?<eos> Okay, Julie, get ready. Let's go up the rope again.<eos> Ready?<eos> (Christine) You have got exactly five seconds... to get those clothes off.<eos> Ready, Julie?<eos> Hurry up.<eos> (KITT) This road leads to Gainesboro Prison, Michael.<eos> They all do tonight, pal.
Well, what is it?<eos> Statistics?<eos> Calculus?<eos> Just what is it you're trying to drum into this impenetrable cranium?<eos> I teach banking and finance.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Not everyone does things your way, Dad.<eos> Certainly was a pleasure.<eos> I didn't know that Nicholas was into finance?<eos> Neither did I.
Coffee break's almost over. Come on, man.<eos> Let's get outta here.!<eos> Hey, man, this isn't exactly made by Mattel, huh?<eos> [Engine Starts]<eos> - [Chortling]<eos> - Come on, man.<eos> [Beeping] Hey, man, you're going backwards!<eos> Hit the brake!<eos> Put it in first.!<eos> Do something.!
Okay?<eos> Here's your boots, Mr. Bigelow. Cleaned up real nice. Oh.<eos> Uh, Claudia, would you take care of this?<eos> She'll take care of it. Just thank you.<eos> I'm telling you the truth. I had no idea Whit was smuggling anything.<eos> I find that difficult to believe.<eos> You were his partner.<eos> Oh, in name only.<eos> Whit, he was the one with all the contacts.<eos> Uh, he did all the importing.
Uh, Claudia, would you take care of this?<eos> She'll take care of it. Just thank you.<eos> I'm telling you the truth. I had no idea Whit was smuggling anything.<eos> I find that difficult to believe.<eos> You were his partner.<eos> Oh, in name only.<eos> Whit, he was the one with all the contacts.<eos> Uh, he did all the importing.<eos> - And you?<eos> - Oh, I do the selling.
LEE:<eos> Yeah, but Cross does.<eos> He waited till you were asleep and then went through your homework.<eos> - You only brought home samples, right?<eos> - Yeah. Just one or two from each batch.<eos> Just as a precaution to check before we'd declassify and burn them.<eos> Hmm.<eos> So he's hungry for the rest.<eos> He knows what files he wants but he can't know which warehouse they come from.<eos> Oh, but I do.
Forty-five seconds.<eos> Here goes nothing.<eos> This is your last chance.<eos> All right, hold it.<eos> Drop your weapon.<eos> Continue to walk with your hands in the air.<eos> Hey, boys, the party's up here!<eos> It's their leader, go!<eos> - You saved her, Dad.<eos> You did it.
Let's give it a go.<eos> We're all going to die.<eos> It doesn't look great right at the moment, that's true.<eos> Since everything's about to end... will you do something for me?<eos> Probably.<eos> What?<eos> Can you...<eos> Say it, Thelma.<eos> Just, please, tell me that you love me.<eos> Or that you once did.
Take what they're willing to give you.<eos> You should jump at this chance.<eos> He's your pal, isn't he?<eos> He was.<eos> Fine, but if he vouches for you, you'll be out of here.<eos> And it'll save you the special court.<eos> You won't get sent to prison, or you'll get a suspended sentence.<eos> Now you'd better be discreet if you want to stay in the game.<eos> I've never had to beg a defendant to deign to leave prison.<eos> Then don't do it now.
The operation goes fine.<eos> Unfortunately, one serious problem remains.<eos> Do you know what it is?<eos> - The frequencies. - "Exactamente."<eos> For anything to be worth anything, we must, as you know, have the daily transmitting frequencies.<eos> Well, that's not entirely true, as "you" know.<eos> The fact is I can't get them.<eos> I don't have access to them.<eos> He assured me that he could get them.<eos> - No, I didn't.
What?<eos> No, not Gulisvardi.<eos> Why did you think of that name?<eos> Zurab, Gulisvardi.<eos> PRAYER<eos> Have you ever met Durmishkhan, a merchant?<eos> He's tall and handsome.<eos> No, we haven't met him.<eos> And you, did you see him?<eos> No, I didn't.
- You shouldn't have said that.<eos> - How did I know?<eos> I mean, he lies about everything.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Coffee.<eos> Looks like they scrape it off the bottom of the Mississippi.<eos> Everything's polluted.<eos> The coffee, the kids...<eos> - How do you know where Vernon went?<eos> - I don't.
- I heard the front door slam.<eos> - The murderer must have run out.<eos> - Three murders.<eos> - Six altogether.<eos> This is getting serious.<eos> No gun.<eos> Yvette dropped it here.<eos> - Very well.<eos> I know who did it.<eos> - You do?
What's your name, son?<eos> My name is Daryl.<eos> And what you doing up in these parts?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Foul! - Foul!<eos> You saw it. You saw it, didn't you?<eos> Foul, right?<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> - Was it a foul?<eos> I don't...
He is Daddee.<eos> I told you about him... the one in my dreams.<eos> Hey, Daddee.<eos> Yes, we know you.<eos> When a dream becomes flesh trouble is not far behind.<eos> He has a fever.<eos> He is near death.<eos> Father, surely you can cure him.<eos> Even a great storm cannot always quench a forest fire.<eos> Wanadi, do it.
The weird thing is I haven't had dreams like this since I was a kid.<eos> Lori, it's a dream,<eos> Lori?<eos> Wow,<eos> - Is this what your first dream was like?<eos> - Wolfgang!<eos> This is a private dream,<eos> - Not any more,<eos> - You too? I thought you never dream,<eos> Yeah, so did I,
G-George, too.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - I l-looked.<eos> Tina and Eddie haven't come back either.<eos> - W-where are they?<eos> - It's OK.<eos> Calm down, Jake.<eos> Let's take this slowly.<eos> Where did Matt say he was going?<eos> - He didn't.
What have you got downstairs?<eos> Pornography?<eos> Where's the light?<eos> You could bury 15 people in there.<eos> Old Mayène was right.<eos> He was right.<eos> But we won't tell him.<eos> We have 3 options:<eos> We let Berger keep digging,<eos> We do the digging, without him...
Yeah.<eos> Were you faithful to him?<eos> Really?<eos> Really.<eos> - Was she faithful to you?<eos> - Yeah, as far as I know.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means, as far as I know. I didn't kill her.<eos> I know you didn't.<eos> No, you don't.
Well, at least it gives me a chance to housebreak you.<eos> Housebroken, is it?<eos> I'm going to have to teach you a lesson, my girl.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Dan.<eos> Dan... stop, don't.<eos> Dan, stop it!<eos> Come, my pretty.<eos> Dan, I don't like that.<eos> Don't.
He killed him.<eos> Besides, I do not like people in my room!<eos> All right, that's enough.<eos> I think you both better leave, now.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> That is none of your business.<eos> - Yeah, I think it is my business!<eos> You know, I would not want to see a fellow student, especially one as promising as yourself, be thrown out of school, out of the profession... on moral ground.<eos> I think Dr. Halsey just might understand.<eos> Oh, do you?
I love Billy.<eos> Billy from the roof?<eos> I took off work because I thought you wouldn't be here.<eos> I'm sick.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Just sickness.<eos> You can't have the Pretenders album.<eos> - That's mine.<eos> - I bought it.<eos> You did not!
Get your hands behind your head !<eos> Turn around !<eos> What the hell is this, huh?<eos> I swear to God, I don't know nothing about it, man.<eos> I want to know where Masters prints!<eos> I'm gonna throw your ass over the bridge!<eos> Talk to me or I throw your ass over the bridge!<eos> I don't know!<eos> I don't know where he prints!<eos> Nobody does!
It's nice of you... You'll eat it with your girlfriends<eos> I'm with a friend...<eos> I've got something urgent to finish<eos> It'll take us the night, for sure<eos> Sorry<eos> I hope you're not angry...<eos> We'll make it up Kisses everywhere<eos> They still live here the 2 guys with the baby?<eos> The ones who had trouble with the police...<eos> Oh yes, they do
Forget tennis. It was just the last straw.<eos> I'm sorry, I can't marry you. One day you'll be glad I said so.<eos> - We're too different.<eos> - But I...<eos> I love you. And... I did think you loved me.<eos> I did not.<eos> I thought I did at first.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> As for your loving me, you don't, not really.<eos> You don't.
Miss Honeychurch, your brother has told me.<eos> - Did he?<eos> - I needn't say it will go no further.<eos> Mother... Charlotte...<eos> Cecil... Freddy... you...<eos> If I may say so, I'm certain you've done the right thing.<eos> Tell me more of the Miss Alans. How splendid of them to go abroad.<eos> I want them to start from Venice and then go by cargo steamer down the Illyrian coast.<eos> - Did Freddy say he'd drive straight back?<eos> - No, he didn't.
Michael.<eos> Michael, I've isolated the poison.<eos> What is it? A sophisticated derivative compound... originating in the orchidaceous Bauhinia veriegata.<eos> In plain English, please.<eos> The rare Jantilius orchid. So that's what Renard meant when he said it hides a deep, dark secret. The secret of death.<eos> Unfortunately, there's no known antidote for it.<eos> KITT, if the poison comes from the orchid... there's also a good chance the orchid could produce the antidote.<eos> That's right, Michael. All right, as soon as we get her to the hospital, it's harvest time.<eos> But I told you, Mr. Renard left a short time ago in his private jet.<eos> Not to me, he didn't.
Out there, that boat has no top end.<eos> Now that boat is set up right.<eos> - Yours?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I see you've got yourself a hotshot driver.<eos> [ Chuckles ] He's crazy.<eos> Wild and crazy, totally insane, but he wins.<eos> Louis McCarthy.<eos> But you already know that.<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
Everything except game.<eos> Do you like handsome men, sweetheart?<eos> Yes, you know there is a coincidence?<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the masks are.<eos> - The masks?<eos> A comedian, my lord.<eos> - Part of your pagan ritual?<eos> It can not hurt.<eos> - That I determine myself.<eos> That he did.
- - No idea.<eos> All out.<eos> No, after you.<eos> Forward. Come on.<eos> Fast, the following can be overcome.<eos> Your back, hurry.<eos> Forward.<eos> Come on. We hurry.<eos> No, not me.<eos> No, I do not.
We'll grab a cup of tea to settle your nerves.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> -Will you stop skulking?<eos> -I'm not skulking.<eos> -They recognized me. -So?<eos> You don't know them.<eos> I don't know Lord Bromfield either.<eos> Do you know what he had to say about all this?<eos> -'No comment.'<eos> -A good thing to do in a situation like this.
[SIGHS]<eos> Mother, I know that I've lied to you before.<eos> In the past I have.<eos> But I don't wanna do it anymore, because it makes me feel just awful.<eos> Course it does.<eos> It's totally against your nature.<eos> I mean, you were never a secretive child.<eos> You always came to me with your little confidences, and I always understood.<eos> - I don't think you'd understand this one.<eos> - Oh, but I already do.
Probably nothing.<eos> Elizabeth?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Feels like someone...<eos> - Is this your car?<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> You frightened us.<eos> Park's off-limits after 4 p.m. Bates' orders.<eos> - I'm sorry. We didn't know.<eos> - You do now.
The left say he's a secret CIA agent.<eos> The right say he's a secret KGB agent.<eos> I've heard something quite different, that there is 1 million-worth of diamonds from South Africa in a Downing Street safe,<eos> - but it's only a rumour.<eos> - Is that true?<eos> Yes.<eos> So, there are all those diamonds in Downing Street!<eos> - Are there?<eos> - You said there were!<eos> - I didn't.
Come on.<eos> Jessie.<eos> You too, Wise.<eos> Your friend Brogan is a threat to me, Jessie.<eos> I don't know what he wants, but it's got to be settled.<eos> I can't believe this is you, Ben.<eos> I think my mother would snap if she knew.<eos> I get things done in this town.<eos> And the people I work for, like your mother don't care how that happens.<eos> Just that I do it.
If He didn't want me to praise Him with music...<eos> ... whyimplantthedesire...<eos> ... likea lustin my body?<eos> And then deny me the talent?<eos> Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson.<eos> Maestro!<eos> How do you like it?<eos> It's Turkish.<eos> My hairdresser said that everything this year's going to be Turkish.<eos> Does he?
Yes.<eos> Then tell me why.<eos> What's up?<eos> Won't you say?<eos> No.<eos> You wouldn't like it.<eos> Nor would I.<eos> Don't you feel good?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
And another thing:<eos> Leave my sister alone, you hear me?<eos> I won't have her turned into a whore like you. Me a whore?<eos> How dare you speak to me like this?<eos> Everybody here knows your sister sleeps around. -What did you say?<eos> What did you say?<eos> - You heard!<eos> Momo...<eos> What have you done to her, damn you?<eos> I didn't do anything to her.
When I fly, it's like in a dream.<eos> Only it's not a dream.<eos> You can't put it into words.<eos> You kind of have to feel it.<eos> You can fly like a bird?<eos> When I fly I am a bird.<eos> This is getting too weird.<eos> You got to stop it.<eos> I thought you would understand.<eos> Well, I don't.
Now what do we do with her?<eos> Leave her there.<eos> No like her anyway.<eos> Hello?<eos> Miss McGillvary!<eos> Come out, come out, wherever you are! Come out wherever you are!<eos> Sorry.<eos> We are going to have to stop dancing and get some rest.<eos> Horses and bulls ship out tomorrow and the following day, I fight.<eos> - You do?
So Tina wanted Lou to leave Danny and go with Sid Bacharach?<eos> That's exactly what I'm saying.<eos> See, three days earlier... Tina had set up a secret lunch meeting at some steak joint in Manhattan.<eos> Well, guys, we finally made it.<eos> Lou Canova, Sid Bacharach.<eos> - Sid, this is Lou.<eos> - A pleasure, Mr Bacharach.<eos> Truly.<eos> I've only heard wonderful things about you from Tina.<eos> - She does that all the time.
I must not fear.<eos> You feel the flesh crisping. Fear is the mind killer.<eos> Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.<eos> I will face my fear. Flesh dropping off.<eos> The pain!<eos> Enough!<eos> Kull wahad!<eos> No woman child ever withstood that much.<eos> Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.<eos> Do it!
Screw 'em.<eos> This is only one little corner of the world.<eos> Start Thursday?<eos> - Sounds OK.<eos> Hard work, but you'll get used to it.<eos> Oh, hi, Ariel. - Chuck Cranston wants to see you.<eos> Meet him at the back of his daddy's field tomorrow, five thirty.<eos> So what happens tomorrow at five thirty?<eos> You'll have to show up to find out.<eos> And if I don't?
You will never find a home, be at home here or in the jungle, until you do.<eos> You must overcome what has happened to you.<eos> You must transcend the loss, the pain and create something new.<eos> John.<eos> Don't give in so soon.<eos> Otherwise, all that you have achieved all our work, will be in vain.<eos> - Of course I will stay and help you...<eos> - As my keeper.<eos> - You don't need a keeper, John.<eos> - No, I don't.
- You seen lots?<eos> - How many you seen?<eos> I'll tell you how many.<eos> None.<eos> Let me see yours.<eos> Looksies, no feelsies.<eos> Peggy...<eos> Peggy, I...<eos> - You like it, don't you?<eos> - Not for free, I don't.
Come on!<eos> OK!<eos> It's on the other side.<eos> Do you want me to cross?<eos> No. That's OK.<eos> How much do I owe you?<eos> 38 f.<eos> That's all.<eos> One can always give a tip.<eos> Well, I don't.
- Paulie... - Oh, man, it hurts so much.<eos> - Did they give you anything for this? - Yeah. - What did they give you?<eos> - Yeah. They gave me... they gave me this stuff.<eos> They gave me this stuff at the hospital.<eos> But I took all of it.<eos> I've been taking it all day.<eos> - You took all of this? - It ain't done a fucking thing!<eos> - You took all of this?<eos> - I took it all, man.<eos> - Charlie, I didn't do nothing, man.
"I said, I may not know what I need."<eos> "One thing, one thing's for certain, baby."<eos> "I know what I want, yeah.<eos> And it's to please you, baby."<eos> "I'm begging down on my knees.<eos> I want you!"<eos> "I want you!"<eos> ("Baby, baby, bib)'<eos> "I want you!"<eos> "Yes, I do!"
Mash, chips, crisps?<eos> Yes? everything.<eos> And Pervillard, too.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> So am I.<eos> - Who's that?<eos> - Jack Donaghy.<eos> Yes.<eos> I've always wondered who lives there.<eos> Everyone does.
This map is nothing.<eos> They already have the stone.<eos> (groaning) I had it in my hands, Ira.<eos> These hands that are gonna break every bone in your body.<eos> Later.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Where is the stone?<eos> - I don't...
All right!<eos> Just a minute.<eos> Eighty, seventy, sixty fifty, forty, thirty go ahead.<eos> Throw it!<eos> Conditions are hopeless.<eos> That did it.<eos> The templates?<eos> Do you know how much they're worth?<eos> Luther wants them pretty bad.<eos> - Yeah, he does.
Excuse me.<eos> Look out.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> Nice earrings.<eos> - Is something the matter?<eos> -No, nothing at all.<eos> I was thinking.<eos> You don't have to leave the country.<eos> - I do.<eos> -You don't.
- Call your dogs off!<eos> - Yours first.<eos> They are interested in the other party's dogs.<eos> My dogs are non-party. They're used to different smells.<eos> Where do you keep your dogs?<eos> They smell.<eos> My dogs smell what they smell.<eos> Our dogs don't smell.<eos> I refute that.<eos> They do.
You must be very hungry, I reckon!<eos> - There, sit down! - Grandpa, mate.<eos> Shove over a bit.<eos> What, me?<eos> Come on, pour some!<eos> Take it!<eos> Bon appetit!<eos> Don't eat that! Who knows what's in it?<eos> - Does it taste good?<eos> - It does.
Well, you see, we're sort of a new consumer organisation.<eos> FACE: Ralph Nader has approved us.<eos> What we do is run random checks of agro-vehicles.<eos> Make sure they are all operating up to U.S. Department standards.<eos> Your vehicle's lucky enough to have been chosen.<eos> [Clears throat] Congratulations.<eos> It's kind of a privilege.<eos> - By the way, I didn't catch the name.<eos> - Didn't throw it. Anyway, see, we give you a few legal papers... guaranteeing that we'll bring your truck back exactly like we found it.<eos> And we do some actual documented farm work.
Most of me.<eos> Thanks for cutting that maniac off.<eos> You know what happened?<eos> A car was coming at me from over there.<eos> You seemed to be coming at me from over there.<eos> You must be some kind of a driver, Michael Knight. Wait a minute.<eos> How'd you know it was me?<eos> I heard you.<eos> I think whoever tried to kill John thinks you're an eyewitness just like I did.<eos> What if they still do. Michael.
- Yes, sir? Give her a couple on the ass!<eos> That will wake that bitch up!<eos> No sleeping at the job.<eos> Alright, you miserable creatures! I expect to see all of you sitting up straight at once.<eos> You have plenty of time to lay down in your grave.<eos> Oh yes. What was it that our lord Jesus said?<eos> Oh, I remember: "Stay awake for the hour is near".<eos> Any attempt to escape from this island is doomed to fail you right from the start.<eos> Let us proceed to the high spot of the evening.<eos> Olga, kindly do the honours.
Go.<eos> Go, now.<eos> Do you like smoking?<eos> He's a wonderful person.<eos> I did know that you'd been married, before me.<eos> How did you know?<eos> I had time to look into it.<eos> But I didn't know he'd come back and you'd had a child.<eos> Why didn't you say?<eos> Because you didn't.
One of our best friends kills himself and we don't know why.<eos> No one knows why anyone does anything.<eos> Why did I choose these socks today?<eos> There's a great equation:<eos> Your socks, Alex's death.<eos> They're pretty sad socks.<eos> I believe that everybody does everything to get laid.<eos> Who said that?<eos> Freud?<eos> No, I did.
- Hi, Tad.<eos> - Hi, Dad.<eos> Despite that fact, the scare has reached alarming proportions.<eos> Sharp Cereal has been unavailable for comment.<eos> Nope, nothing wrong here, folks.<eos> Cute.<eos> That's our ad campaign.<eos> They've recalled the whole goddamn cereal.<eos> - Then there's no harm done, is there?<eos> - "No harm done"?
Off you go, ducky.<eos> She'll have to find another canoe to paddle.<eos> Ours, I'm afraid, hath holes.<eos> Did I tell you, Sir?<eos> I mingled, during the interval.<eos> You should hear what they think.<eos> Michelangelo, William Blake.<eos> God knows who else you reminded them of.<eos> Michelangelo?<eos> Do they?
- What did Osborne want?<eos> A chest. A big church chest.<eos> That's not a nun with tits.<eos> You know, with religious panels.<eos> Big...<eos> - What for?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> But he promised me 2,000 American dollars if I could get him one.<eos> - And did you?<eos> - Yes, I did.
- Now.<eos> Now, you don't know what time it is.<eos> - What time is it?<eos> - It's 7:00 in the morning.<eos> In the morning?<eos> Does that man with the wet shoes come often? - Who?<eos> Domenico? - Yes.<eos> So this is what it's all about.<eos> It depends.<eos> Sometimes he does, sometimes he doesn't.
Something's going on.<eos> What did you all tell him, to keep him away?<eos> I never spoke to him.<eos> Not you, Marion or Henri.<eos> You're imagining things.<eos> She'd do it.<eos> She's turned you against him.<eos> That won't stop me from seeing him.<eos> She didn't say a word.<eos> All right, she did.
Marion had to go to Paris.<eos> She left you alone?<eos> She could've driven you to the beach.<eos> I didn't want to see anyone today.<eos> OK... I'll go.<eos> I wanted to apologize for yesterday.<eos> You were right to tell me.<eos> Your friend must be furious.<eos> Henri must've told him you talked.<eos> You didn't?
I wonder why somebody hasn't blown his head off.<eos> Even the most primitive society has an innate respect for the insane.<eos> I wanna go home.<eos> Cheer up. The gangs are gonna come back, and once they get the dope off the streets, people will persist in joining things.<eos> You'll see the gangs come back.<eos> If you live that long.<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> I ain't never seen you sit still so long.<eos> How do you know when someone's crazy?<eos> Well, you don't always.
Then I'd have to go to the hospital and question you. And that's two different sets of reports.<eos> So the more I think about it... when I weigh all my options... the least amount of paperwork for me to do is... if I just blow your fucking head off.<eos> Gotta hand it to you, Flowers.<eos> If you're gonna hide, you might as well hide under a Cadillac.<eos> His name is Flowers. He's a car thief. He's one of the best.<eos> He's been stealing foreign cars for a ring that ships them across the border. They got a really fine operation.<eos> He gets an order for a blue BMW coupe... Flowers steals 'em for him.<eos> And there's no speculation in the deal, either.<eos> He gets them the year, make and model that they want.<eos> He also does some domestic work for a few of our local cuties.
-No, I don't.<eos> You chase them?<eos> Well, actually, I believe that you really only fall in love once.<eos> And when you do, you should dedicate your whole life to that person.<eos> Yes, I totally agree.<eos> But on the other hand... ... I'vealwaysfeltthatlove should never stand in the way of a good time.<eos> -How about you?<eos> -I do like to have fun.<eos> You do?<eos> What do you do for fun?
And put on the shoes, huh?<eos> A good Jew only goes barefoot when someone has died.<eos> I'm not that kind of Jew.<eos> Well, I am.<eos> Put them on.<eos> Mr. Weinstein, what were you like as a boy?<eos> Oh, I loved to climb anything.<eos> Like a cat, I could climb.<eos> - I always wanted to be Douglas Fairbanks.<eos> - Oh, you still do, Mr. Agee.
really?<eos> Then let us try as well.<eos> Make the prosecutor an offer.<eos> I've got to hush up this business.<eos> Hush it up completely.<eos> I have daughters, you know.<eos> I understand you. I myself have a son.<eos> With all my respect for you and deep gratitude for your generosity...<eos> We'II discuss gratitude later, when this affair is disposed of.<eos> Do it.
I haven't slept yet.<eos> tell Sergey Petrovich I want to see him.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> well, what did you call me for?<eos> You just got up or about to go to bed?<eos> Just got up.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Don't shout. You won't frighten anyone.<eos> - I'm not shouting.<eos> - So don't.
I'm telling you this so that you won't be in a hurry to get married.<eos> Mom, why did they all die and we're still alive?<eos> You were lucky, daughter.<eos> The others died because they were born weak.<eos> And they were born weak because your father drank too much and beat me too often.<eos> uncle Prokhor knows that.<eos> Yes, he used to thrash her all right.<eos> He learned how to thrash people at sea, so he did the job thoroughly, skillfully.<eos> Did you beat your wife, uncle Prokhor?<eos> Of course I did.
Draw up a report at once and send it to colonel Popov.<eos> AIexei Ivanovich has been informed.<eos> Take him away, he's dead.<eos> And clean up everything.<eos> Don't worry, we'II do everything.<eos> We'II scrub everything clean.<eos> well, Anna, did you see today<eos> what our MeInikov is like?<eos> - That prig.<eos> - Yes, I did.
And I don't fear you, rachel.<eos> Just pity.<eos> Oh, rachel, rachel...<eos> When that husband of mine gambIed away all our houses, our ships, our wharves, the whole business at cards in one night I was actually glad.<eos> You won't believe it, but I was.<eos> And he staked his last emerald ring<eos> and won it all back.<eos> And a Iot more besides.<eos> And after that he started drinking.<eos> And doing other ugly things.
Better.<eos> AII right, Iet's leave it your way.<eos> A human woman.<eos> Go, daughter, and tell them to heat the samovar up for me.<eos> I want tea so much.<eos> NataIya.<eos> Can you lift your ass from the sofa and talk to your mother?<eos> well, I've lifted it.<eos> Do you want to go abroad?<eos> Yes, I do.
Come on, don't be so uptight.<eos> You must stay in Nice?<eos> Three more days?<eos> But don't be so nasty to my secretary.<eos> Stop saying "that girl".<eos> Her name's Barbara.<eos> Lost?<eos> If she said that you were right.<eos> Why did you insult my wife? You told her to get lost.<eos> No, I didn't!
There's a beach like this, which ought to be on the other side of the island.<eos> We'll cover more ground if we separate.<eos> We'll have every gun on that ship ready for them when they return.<eos> Bosun Gilbert.<eos> Aye, aye, Captain Moon.<eos> Bloody murderers.<eos> Unhand me, you heathens.<eos> Percy... I think I found the tree that that paralyzing liquid comes from.<eos> Just stab some under the skin and...<eos> You do what?
And then what happened?<eos> Well, erm...<eos> Avigdor was there too.<eos> He'll tell you.<eos> Was Rabbi Zalman angry or did he laugh?<eos> He...he laughed.<eos> Didn't he, Avigdor?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Did you laugh?<eos> We both did.
You bite your nails?<eos> - Don't look.<eos> - They're false?<eos> Say anything and I'll tell everyone you sleep with Mme. Loubet.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> It's common knowledge.<eos> There's no point in telling then.<eos> I promise I won't tell a soul.<eos> And I'll take you back if you prefer.<eos> No, don't.
The siren isn't working anymore.<eos> Daddy doesn't mind that.<eos> - Can you fix it?<eos> - Tonight.<eos> But it's urgent. You have to go to school.<eos> Get dressed. Ineke's father has hair on his chest too.<eos> Does he? How do you know?<eos> I saw it in the swimming pool.<eos> Bertie, don't read at the table.<eos> Do that at school.
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.<eos> The creature is wanted f0r a murder he didn't c0mmit.<eos> David Banner is believed t0 be dead.<eos> And he must let the w0rld think that he is dead until he can find a way t0 c0ntr0l the raging spirit that dwells within him. (ROARS)<eos> You all right?<eos> Oh, yeah. I'm all right.<eos> Can you fix it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'll try.<eos> Well, you really did it, didn't you? Yeah.
I got all the stuff you need somewhere around here.<eos> Come on.<eos> (muttering)<eos> Right in there.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> Well, Studebaker, DeSoto.<eos> You really have a mixed bag of parts here, don't you, Isaac?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Ol' Isaac got everything you need.<eos> Everything you don't, too.
You okay?<eos> Uh, sure.<eos> How much do I owe you there?<eos> Uh, nothin'.<eos> Forget it.<eos> It's on the house.<eos> Hey, thanks.<eos> - Some people.<eos> - I know, buddy. I know.<eos> He do any damage?
- You sure?<eos> - Hi, Bill.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Did the kids get to eat all right?<eos> Yeah. They went to get some pizza.<eos> They should be back soon.<eos> - This is Dr Sneiderman.<eos> This is Bill.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - How do you do?
Carly?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Carly.<eos> Christ, she tore the fuckin' place apart.<eos> No, she didn't.<eos> You saw it.<eos> She couldn't have done all this.<eos> We both saw it with our own eyes. We stood right there and saw it, George.<eos> - You saw it? - Yes.<eos> Yes, we did.
But it's not important.<eos> That again?<eos> Don't oversleep the fishing season!<eos> Well...<eos> Oh, not this way.<eos> - Can I help you with your bags?<eos> - I'll do it myself.<eos> It's going to start now.<eos> - Do you hear me, mama?<eos> - I do.
The fact is, gentlemen, nothing serious was wrong with that ship.<eos> Ted Striker folded up on the approach.<eos> That's a lie!<eos> Order!<eos> Order!<eos> On March 5, 1980, flight 209 into Chicago lost its crew in midair.<eos> And on that fateful night, Ted Striker saved that plane.<eos> I'd like to call one of the passengers from that flight, if it pleases the court.<eos> Do you swear on the Constitution to tell the whole truth, and nothing but?<eos> I do.
Even artists.<eos> When a country starts doing that, it's a terrible sign.<eos> Come live in Paris.<eos> -I'm a German.<eos> I don't want to leave.<eos> Kick that dangerous fool out.<eos> I hate that man. He makes me...<eos> What's the word?<eos> Puke.<eos> -But he also does good things.
Giorgio is a former any.<eos> I am nobody. Do you see " no "?<eos> I'm a nobody, do not forget it.<eos> But the point is... It is important have a point.<eos> Giorgio was beaten.<eos> Whatever?<eos> Should I commit självmord-<eos> 'Cause he defeated?<eos> Oh no, you!<eos> I do it!
What's your name, kid?<eos> Jiro.<eos> Jiro, hm.<eos> Where did you learn to talk English?<eos> School, where did you learn?<eos> Are these your pets?<eos> No.<eos> Our dinner.<eos> What are you cooking?<eos> We don't.
Just as my grandfather handed my brother the two swords to give to my father... Hideo grabbed them cut him on the back with the sword right across the spine.<eos> There were gunshots.<eos> One of the soldiers with Hideo shot my grandfather in cold blood.<eos> My father ran to his own father.<eos> My grandfather cursed Hideo he was dying.<eos> Do you want me to surrender the sword to this man?<eos> This sword with its equal have been the sword of my families honor for generations.<eos> I think I understand.<eos> No.<eos> You do not.
Who are these people that represent the world?<eos> Seymour, Noyes, the Poulencs.<eos> What do they see?<eos> Enough to delight them... to exercise their tongues, to discuss patrimony.<eos> Or the lack of it.<eos> They see then what they have long been searching for. Do you think?<eos> And that means?<eos> An opportunity to braid you for not producing an heir.<eos> Woman, it takes two.<eos> It does indeed, Sir.
They're at your place.<eos> - My place?<eos> Oh no.<eos> Oh yes. - No.<eos> Yes.<eos> - No.<eos> Do we need reinforcements?<eos> Honey, I can explain everything.<eos> Who told them to undress?<eos> He did.
Of all unicorns, she is the only one who knows what regret is, and love.<eos> -Come then.<eos> Come with me. -l will.<eos> You are a true wizard now, as you always wished.<eos> Does it make you happy?<eos> Well, men don't always know when they're happy, but I think so.<eos> -And you? -l am a little afraid to go home.<eos> I have been mortal and some part of me is mortal yet.<eos> I am no longer like the others, for no unicorn was ever born who could regret.<eos> But now I do.
Hello, Amy.<eos> Amy...<eos> Give me a break, will you?<eos> Here, come on.<eos> Will you eat some more now?<eos> You told me to open up this one.<eos> Now, this is apri...<eos> Gotcha! Gotcha!<eos> You want a little more apricot?<eos> Don't do that anymore, now.
- It would be wonderful.<eos> Sooner or later, a persistent reporter, like Marie Jouvet...<eos> But what can I say? What can I tell her?<eos> - That I thought him an imbecile?<eos> - No.<eos> That I thought him the luckiest man in the world with the brain of a retarded clam?<eos> Of course not.<eos> You know he was an idiot, I know he was an idiot, but to everyone else he was the greatest detective since Sherlock Holmes.<eos> - If I tell the truth...<eos> - Then don't.
Yes. Yes, I've heard that.<eos> But you do... testify quite a bit against other physicians.<eos> Isn't that correct?<eos> You are available for that, so long as you're paid to be there.<eos> Sir, yes.<eos> When a thing is wrong, as in this case, I am available.<eos> I'm 74 years old.<eos> I'm not board-certified.<eos> I've been practising medicine for 46 years, and I know when an injustice has been done.<eos> Do you, indeed?
- Mr Concannon?<eos> - No further questions, Your Honour.<eos> Thank you, Dr Towler.<eos> Mr Galvin, rebuttal?<eos> Kaitlin Costello Price.<eos> (bailiff) Kaitlin Costello Price.<eos> State your name, please.<eos> Kaitlin Costello Price.<eos> Do you swear the evidence you give will be the whole truth, so help you God?<eos> - I do.
I'm Norma Cassady.<eos> -You were just grand.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> And this is King Marchand.<eos> -How do you do?<eos> -How do you do?<eos> I got to admit for a while there I was really cheesed off.<eos> King's tongue was hanging out a foot.<eos> When you took that wig off, I just couldn't believe it.<eos> -King still doesn't.
But there's an Army Procurement Officer coming and you're the only one that knows anything.<eos> Did you hear that, Rose?<eos> I may need a witness sometime.<eos> Well, you're used to dealing with those details that he'll need to know about.<eos> And you know where the data is.<eos> And you have those nice ways of dealing with Army Procurement Officers.<eos> - Erin?<eos> - The answer is no, J.D.<eos> - Erin, you've got to.<eos> - No, I don't.
- You bet.<eos> Boris Vladimirovich Sturmer, Court Chamberlain, member of the State Council, owner of numerous estates<eos> Progressing paralysis and euphoria.<eos> The squirrels have taken over upstairs?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Dubious morals, has a mistress.<eos> Who?<eos> Not this one, I hope?<eos> Greedy, obstinate, ambitious, loves power.<eos> Who doesn't?
- She'll drop dead. She'll love them. - Right.<eos> Uh, yellow roses. Two dozen.<eos> I think something else would look nice too.<eos> - Red roses.<eos> With the yellow. - Right.<eos> She won't know what hit her. You'll be aces with her.<eos> - You're a nice boy.<eos> - Two dozen red, okay?<eos> - Do you know what happened?<eos> - No, I don't.
Red light!<eos> I remember seeing an ambulance stopping at the red light.<eos> - What if someone sees us?<eos> - We did not see anyone.<eos> Would not be right, because They will bury someone here.<eos> Worried about sins?<eos> We will.<eos> Willard, if you, I'll kick your ass!<eos> Hi there.<eos> What do you do?
I know, I missed you so badly, but it's too dangerous.<eos> - She won't wake up now.<eos> - You're so wet.<eos> I'd been waiting out there for two hours.<eos> So salty.<eos> Let me.<eos> Lie back.<eos> Aunt Matty?<eos> What do you say?<eos> - I did.
The one who was all burnt.<eos> - Is he a friend of yours, Janet?<eos> - Not really.<eos> It's... it's just that it's the kind of thing you think happens to other people.<eos> Not to somebody you know.<eos> George.<eos> George LeMoyne was his name.<eos> Excellent, at least we know his name.<eos> Do you know where he's from?<eos> No, honey, I don't.
It seems a terribly lonely place to live.<eos> Well, you see, David and I had a motor accident on the day we were married.<eos> That's how he lost his legs.<eos> He was training to be a fighter pilot.<eos> And then after the accident he...<eos> Well, we both wanted to run away, so we came here.<eos> It seemed like a good idea.<eos> It might have been a mistake.<eos> You can't blame him for wanting to run away.<eos> No, I don't.
Don't kid me!<eos> At 8:12, your lights were still on. At 8:20, you drove off in your car.<eos> At a quarter past midnight, the car...<eos> I was showing Roland my designs.<eos> Are you still there?<eos> Answer me.<eos> You can't be jealous.<eos> He's not interested in women.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> You don't?
You know what she did last month?<eos> A former lover of hers who lives in New Caledonia came to see her in Grenoble.<eos> Well, she spent three days in Paris to avoid meeting him...<eos> So he wouldn't see how she's aged.<eos> You're wrong!<eos> You're all wrong!<eos> That man was Odile's only love. Because of him, she jumped out of a window 20 years ago.<eos> She never let him know that she's a cripple because of him.<eos> She's a remarkable woman, but he never understood it.<eos> Well, neither did I.
No idea.<eos> Shouldn't be surprised.<eos> Americans always seem to think - they can run before they can walk.<eos> - Like their wine, what?<eos> The answer is yes. He's the youngest ambassador ever appointed by the president.<eos> - Are you part of his staff?<eos> - I'm his private secretary, Harvey Dean.<eos> - Kate Reynolds, British television.<eos> - My wife Barbara.<eos> - How do you do?
The world will soon see a lot of your skating too, Miss Dahl.<eos> Only if she works harder. Much harder.<eos> - Uncle Ari, can't I stop now? I'm pooped!<eos> - That's for Miss Brink to decide.<eos> Come, Bibi.<eos> Another half-hour.<eos> - Will you take me to the biathlon?<eos> - You know I have to work this afternoon.<eos> Bibi wants to know if you would escort her, Mr Bond?<eos> - I don't...
With everyone's help, they're all here, just as you always wanted.<eos> All seated around the table, waiting to celebrate your birthday.<eos> Your precious birthday.<eos> And as a special treat, they all get to watch you die.<eos> Murder then suicide.<eos> Now they'll all know just how crazy little Ginny really was!<eos> Surprised?<eos> I hope you are.<eos> I planned it so you'd never suspect a thing.<eos> None of them did.
Oh Christ.<eos> He's fainted.<eos> Here, make him drink.<eos> He is really sick.<eos> I've got some cormen in the first aid kit!<eos> Pulse rate is very weak.<eos> Mike!<eos> Help me get him in the shade.<eos> Burning. Burning up.<eos> Do something.
I told you how important this is to me. I told you!<eos> Why did you adopt me?<eos> What?<eos> Why did you adopt me?<eos> Because I wanted a child.<eos> Because I wanted someone to love.<eos> Don't you act for me.<eos> I wanna know!<eos> Why did you adopt me?<eos> Maybe I did it for a little extra publicity.
It... it's not a gag.<eos> Well, how gullible do you think I am?<eos> There she is, ...the frightened girl in the foreground.<eos> The brooding, mysterious mansion in the background.<eos> - All we need now is a light in the window.<eos> - Mark, I'm not kidding.<eos> I've never been here before.<eos> All right.<eos> - Well, maybe the illustrator knew the place.<eos> - No, he didn't.
And where are you going to deal it?<eos> In Rio, I know the spots.<eos> I'm gonna save you some time.<eos> I don't do this for anyone, but, I like you.<eos> When you get to Rio, go see my friend Debora.<eos> A fine chick with a big clientele.<eos> Take it to her because Rio's a pretty bad place.<eos> If you can't find her, look for Raulzinho at the Cowboy Club.<eos> -You know the place, don't you?<eos> -Yes, I do.
What time is it?<eos> Up we go!<eos> Fucking gringo!<eos> Let's go and make babies.<eos> Sit there, gringo.<eos> Wait a mom.<eos> I'll soon finish you off.<eos> Let me give you a kiss.<eos> Don't push!<eos> Don't do that.
She's free?<eos> That is correct.<eos> - But, uh...<eos> - But what?<eos> She confessed.<eos> Luckily, she confessed to my assistant, Kennedy.<eos> Red-headed guy?<eos> Bet you thought he was a cop, huh?<eos> FRANK:<eos> Yeah, I did.
Your friend came by.<eos> (CAT GROWLS)<eos> You bastard!<eos> Don't come near me.<eos> You're scum, Frank.<eos> I knew that when I met you.<eos> You'll never change.<eos> Your confession.<eos> I don't even need it.<eos> I never did.
We're going the other way, thanks.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Well, I guess I owe you one.<eos> What do you need?<eos> You ever heard of a guy named Marcel Sardino?<eos> Very big, like international.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I bonded him once.<eos> He skipped.<eos> - I want to know where he's holed up.<eos> - Who doesn't?
- Stop it!<eos> - Hey, lady! Lady!<eos> Lady, stop!<eos> Now, lady. I am not gonna hurt you, I promise.<eos> Listen. You stopped me on the road. Remember?<eos> I'm just a truck driver.<eos> I know I talk a lot and I'm given the flights of the imagination, but there's no need to be afraid of me.<eos> Lady, please, let's just go back to the truck, okay?<eos> - We don't want trouble, we never wanted trouble.<eos> - Yeah, but who does?
- My God, you're suspicious.<eos> - Peg?<eos> - Monsignor.<eos> - Mrs Campion, how are you?<eos> - lt was a beautiful Mass.<eos> I wanted to thank you for everything. It's a beautiful wedding.<eos> I wanted to tell you how much I appreciate all your... patience and time.<eos> It was an honour and I, uh... I know that you'll be very happy, Georgette. I'm sure of that.<eos> - Monsignor, you know why I got married.<eos> - Yes, I do.
To the camp. To tell them.<eos> The team.<eos> They must know that we'll be there.<eos> It took me a year to get out of there.<eos> We need a contact.<eos> Colby must know, and also your colonel.<eos> That's not my problem.<eos> You believe that?<eos> I don't know what to believe.<eos> I don't.
Well, yeah.<eos> I listen, too.<eos> Do you know Jason Walton?<eos> Just.<eos> I'm in love with him.<eos> His family and I do all right.<eos> Kid, light and easy, until he told them I was Jewish.<eos> Say something.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because they didn't.
You can't say anything.<eos> This has to be our secret.<eos> Not again.<eos> Everybody's giving me all of their secrets.<eos> I don't want them.<eos> We need our ships.<eos> Do you know where they are?<eos> I think so. But I can't tell you.<eos> Willy, they probably didn't want you to say anything to people who didn't already know about them.<eos> But we do.
My passport is all ready.<eos> It's been ready since last winter.<eos> The next day, Katya came twice with an invitation for dinner in honour of the guests. In the evening they were going to see the fireworks, prepared by Pierre and Michel.<eos> But Oblomov did not go, sending instead Zakhar to say that he had caught a chill, had to drink a hot decoction and stay at home.<eos> Tell me something.<eos> We have talked over everything, there is nothing to tell.<eos> Come, how can that be?<eos> You had been to town. Perhaps there is some news?<eos> I suppose you read?<eos> Yes, I do sometimes.
Excuse me, I have a question.<eos> Did you step on the woman's hand?<eos> I wouldn't think of it.<eos> What do you think of "udder masseur"?<eos> - What's that? - A farmer. It's a joke for the real crowd.<eos> - I think it's good.<eos> - I don't like it.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I just don't.
That depends on Wilson.<eos> You want to stay with Orville?<eos> On your way out, could you kind of tell the nurses what a hero I am?<eos> - Why didn't I think of that?<eos> - Is that the hero?<eos> That's him lying right there.<eos> You're a good man, Philo Beddoe.<eos> That hurts right here.<eos> - Young man's got a real healthy appetite.<eos> - That he does.
I'll show you what it looks like when the plates go off.<eos> No problem.<eos> It takes hours of practice to learn to do that.<eos> Mighty fine shooting, Miss Lily!<eos> Beginner's luck.<eos> Where on earth did you learn how to shoot like that?<eos> Haven't you got something better to do than hang around like a dog in heat?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.<eos> Excellent.<eos> You don't do the shooting around here, I do that.
- Don't you lay a hand on me.<eos> Oh, Eileen, don't now.<eos> Don't, don't...<eos> You'll never get me. Don't, don't, don't.<eos> They're big men. There was a bag, and a duffle bag and a tape recorder.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Did you see a tape recorder?<eos> You'd love to get me! You touch me, and you're dead!<eos> Shh, don't aggravate them.<eos> We didn't...
- Oh, really?<eos> - I think they're disgusting.<eos> - Well, I enjoy them.<eos> All it is is anal regression.<eos> If you wanna quit, I suggest you try another form of childhood stroke.<eos> I don't wanna quit.<eos> I suggest you try an ostrich feather along the small of your back, up your spine to the nape of your neck.<eos> Sounds addictive.<eos> - Why do you come here?<eos> - Why do you?
What else?<eos> Oh, yeah, there's this name keeps popping up all the time.<eos> Tommy Mancusi.<eos> He owns the Cock Pit, four, five other places.<eos> Tommy the Joker they call him.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Are you trying to tell me you don't know who Tommy the Joker is?<eos> I don't know who he is.<eos> Well, I do.
I know how you feel.<eos> But I'm having a real good time now.<eos> I'm enjoying myself.<eos> So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.<eos> I'm having a very good time too.<eos> So there you are.<eos> I'm not such a dog as I think I am.<eos> I think you're a very nice guy.<eos> I don't know why a girl hasn't grabbed you.<eos> Yeah, I don't either.
- That's right.<eos> - Get Mr. Lasky back up here.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> I was just on the Bridge. They're scared.<eos> Real scared.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - It's crazy.<eos> The Russians, us, even the Germans. - We've finally done it.<eos> - Done what, for Christ's sake?
- You hungry, kid? - No.<eos> I'm just tired.<eos> Yeah, me too, kid.<eos> Boy, they got everything covered.<eos> Trains, planes.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe Pittsburgh's connected, too.<eos> Who knows?<eos> They gotta have gangsters in Pittsburgh, too.<eos> They don't.
Maybe it does.<eos> Two, three, four!<eos> Barbed wire and women are the two greatest civilising agents in the world!<eos> /coughs')<eos> /Ella') Are you OK?<eos> Whoo!<eos> I can cut a steer, I can put my red-hot monogram on a maverick... ..in the darkest night that ever blew, but I am poorly put up... ..to paralyse a beautiful young thing like you with matchless eloquence.<eos> Oh, Jesus!<eos> /Ella') I don't understand you.<eos> I never did.
Sports reports fοr television.<eos> - Can I ask yοu a strange questiοn?<eos> - How strange?<eos> Have yοu ever heard abοut the Τhree Sisters?<eos> - You mean thοse black singers?<eos> - Nο. I mean that ancient myth, the triad.<eos> If you're talking about ghοsts or stuff like that...<eos> - Sorry, but I dοn't believe in it.<eos> - How can yοu be so sure?<eos> I don't belieνe in it.
Bruno...<eos> Captain... I'm innocent...<eos> Hang on in there and shut up.<eos> But why?<eos> Go away!<eos> You must be brave.<eos> But you need me.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> - You don't know the way!<eos> - Yes we do.
He told the judge he was just trying to help New York by using our money.<eos> - I hope I can remember everything.<eos> - Good luck.<eos> Thanks.<eos> That's very kind of you.<eos> That's our boy, baby!<eos> That's our boy there!<eos> What do you say about that, folks?<eos> He's got some cowboy in him, huh?<eos> He sure does.
How's that?<eos> - You didn't even look happy after Gamera killed Gaos and Zigra!<eos> Wait!<eos> Keiichi never stays out this long without letting me know where he is...<eos> - I understand...<eos> I haven't seen him but I'll let you know as soon as I do...<eos> Thank you very much. Good day!<eos> Wait!<eos> How'd I get here?<eos> Sister, how ever did you do that?
- St. George's Day, old boy.<eos> - Really? Got a horse, have you?<eos> What's his name?<eos> Did you catch it, dear?<eos> Dragonfly, Major.<eos> - Going to have a flutter, Fawlty?<eos> - No, no, no, no, no.<eos> No, Basil doesn't bet any more, Major.<eos> Do you, dear?<eos> No, I don't, dear, no.
Good evening.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> That felt better.<eos> Thank you, Mr Abbott.<eos> Oh, Dr Abbott, sorry.<eos> - Doctor?<eos> - Yes?<eos> I'm terribly sorry, we hadn't been told.<eos> - We hadn't been told you were a doctor.<eos> - Oh. How do you do, doctor?
Do you ever get homesick?<eos> Oh, yes, but I love it there.<eos> The climate's so wonderful.<eos> You can swim and sunbathe, and then after lunch, drive up into the mountains and ski.<eos> How wonderful.<eos> I like England and the English people, but I sure couldn't take this climate.<eos> Harry finds it too gloomy.<eos> Oh, I don't find it too gloomy.<eos> Do you, Sybil?<eos> Yes, I do, Basil.
It's what you might call justice.<eos> You having to worry on your boys the way I did on Tommy never knowing when something might happen to one of them.<eos> It's your turn to play the waiting game now, John.<eos> Here's your change, John.<eos> Morning, Calvin.<eos> Stopped by to find out if there was any word on when Tommy's body's coming home.<eos> - Army said they'd let me know.<eos> - Nothing today.<eos> It will come.<eos> All such things do.
Ashley asked me to give you this.<eos> [SOBBING]<eos> Oh, Daddy, I'm so miserable.<eos> I know, honey.<eos> It's the worst kind of pain in the world.<eos> I never should have told Mama how he feels.<eos> It's not your Mama's fault.<eos> She just spoke her mind.<eos> That's not the reason a man changes his mind, you know.<eos> Something did.
- Here.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> You know, I think I would like to be 8 again.<eos> Such a gentle time, and so full of innocence.<eos> I think I would like to be 8 forever.<eos> - You can't do that, can you?<eos> - No.<eos> You know, all you can do is keep a little corner of your heart just a little corner, that never quite grows up.<eos> - Do you believe in Santa Claus?<eos> - Do you?
You don't have to do that.<eos> Mary Ellen, I can't tear you away from those people so suddenly.<eos> I thought you wanted to get right to Hollywood.<eos> Few days won't hurt.<eos> Operator.<eos> [PHONE RINGING]<eos> - Phil Baker here.<eos> - Hi, this is Erin Walton.<eos> PHIL:<eos> Oh, hi, Erin, how you doing?
She's good and mad.<eos> Share, Jeffrey.<eos> Give it here!<eos> "A wisteria vine that was filled each spring with heavy-scented clusters of purple blossoms.<eos> The thought of leaving saddened the boy.<eos> He stood looking up at his home and felt as if a curtain were being drawn across the scene, cutting him away from his family and separating them from him.<eos> He knew then that all things change and grow and that when he returned, the wisteria and the fern and geranium would have changed and grown, and that somehow he, too, would have changed, and a curtain would have fallen."<eos> How I wish you could have heard that.<eos> SAM:<eos> I did.
I'm a friend of your brother's.<eos> I'll see you downstairs.<eos> The Wire was my best friend.<eos> He was a great man.<eos> My brother was a criminal.<eos> Maybe he told you about me. Reb?<eos> Look, I have no interest in ever knowing any of my brother's friends.<eos> - You come from a world I wish never existed.<eos> - Well, you don't understand.<eos> I never will.
- I've never hit a woman before, but...<eos> - Let's make up.<eos> - That won't work.<eos> - Of course, it will.<eos> - It won't! Now stop it!<eos> - Nadia, I'm driving the car!<eos> - Let's do it! Let's do it right now!<eos> - We're on the freeway!<eos> I'm driving 55 miles an hour, here!<eos> Will you, for chri...
The Japs haven't got enough camps for all of us.<eos> Come on, children.<eos> She's with God now.<eos> What are you doing, Basie?<eos> Looks like your size, Jim.<eos> I don't want her shoes.<eos> Basie, don't.<eos> I don't want them.<eos> -I don't want them.<eos> -Somebody will.
Never?<eos> Butyou said that he was your son.<eos> I meant the son I never had, but that I mean to have.<eos> I have spies in his camp.<eos> If I asked them to kill him, you know what they'd do?<eos> Kill me.<eos> They love him.<eos> - All Sicily loves him.<eos> - ln the last election ... Silvio Ferra nearly won.<eos> This year, he will.
I promise you.<eos> Under the car get Rognir.<eos> When the big wolf creeps around.<eos> Show me.<eos> Thor outside. Hidden.<eos> Hagor in the air.<eos> Odal and Barga in the fire and hidden.<eos> Lagu day and in the earth.<eos> You will encounter.<eos> The son of Herne will.
One thing for certain, he's not human, but he can play that fiddle of his.<eos> ~ See, Olle? ~ Anyway, I don't believe in him.<eos> Well I do!<eos> Johan? Johan, can you show us where he sits when he plays his fiddle?<eos> Certainly.<eos> There, on that big rock, you see?<eos> That's where he sits all night. His music is sad all of the time.<eos> It's really a shame.<eos> He'll never be allowed to go up to heaven.<eos> ~ But you will, won't you, Johan?
'Joe, fiх the back door... cos I don't want no raper comin' in here.'<eos> And I saуs...'don't worry, honeу.'<eos> 'He don't want уou.'<eos> And I fixed the back door real good... so that the raper don't get her.<eos> Oh, god.<eos> Marjorie.<eos> Go get the police.<eos> God.<eos> I'll staу.<eos> I'll staу with уou.
I would've gotten some time off.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - That's what I'd like to know.<eos> The only way I could get you together was show business.<eos> That's all you wanna talk about.<eos> Besides, I think she's just what he's looking for.<eos> - Just what who's looking for?<eos> - You're a good magician but you got to learn about people.<eos> This'll never do.<eos> - What won't?
Faith is when you truly believe... that what you hope and wish will come true.<eos> How can you believe in a hope, a wish?<eos> You must have faith.<eos> Here they come again.<eos> How you doing?<eos> I've been worse.<eos> I can't remember when.<eos> - I'll make it.<eos> - Sure.<eos> We all will.
- Go on!<eos> - I'll never forget you, Mr. Jim.<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> I'm welling up with tears.<eos> It's all going to overflow.<eos> Cyril says he brought back the Mercedes, so can he have the racket?<eos> It's no solution.<eos> The more I suffer the more I want that money.<eos> We won't get it.<eos> No one will.
Nice one! That was smooth talking! Shut up!<eos> I'll get you for that!<eos> Take it easy!<eos> See what you started? Look at those idiots!<eos> Now move it! Calm down! Relax!<eos> You boys wait here. I'll go and check-in.<eos> I gotta find the john I'm about to piss myself<eos> I'm thirsty, better get some water.<eos> I'd better check out the chicks.<eos> I'll...
Billy and I and a half a dozen agents have been parked by the stable waiting for a break, which we got when we saw you walk inside.<eos> You're our only hope, Amanda.<eos> I'm your only hope.<eos> -This whole operation depends on you.<eos> -Whole operation depends on me.<eos> I guess I ought to mention this--<eos> This could get dangerous.<eos> Well, if they should find out who I am, which they won't and if they should find out that you got me in there, which they won't--<eos> Things could get awfully difficult.<eos> Which they won't.
You're still missing two.<eos> A century ago, when the British made a bloody raid on this temple, a priest hid the last two stones here in the catacombs.<eos> So that's what you've got these slaves digging for?<eos> - They're innocent children.<eos> - They mine gems to support our cause.<eos> They also search for the last two stones.<eos> Soon we will have all the five Sankara stones and the Thuggees will be all-powerful.<eos> What a vivid imagination.<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> You will, Dr Jones.
Beautiful little human!<eos> Beautiful little human!<eos> Laying there and resting!<eos> Let me go get my sisters!<eos> Then she will never rest again!<eos> Ronja, aren't you going home?<eos> -Here, let me help you.<eos> Hold on to me.<eos> -Never leave me again!<eos> I won't.
I only hope they catch the bastard who's pushing it!<eos> You think she was involved with it?<eos> I don't know. She was his chick.<eos> And she did a bit of dealing.<eos> So the cops want to find her and rough her up a bit.<eos> Is this all right?<eos> One of my pals is a chemist and he checks all my stuff.<eos> - I'll snort some to prove it.<eos> - No, I trust you.<eos> - I will, anyway.
-Eighty-five thousand dollars.<eos> -Missing?<eos> Embezzled, Mr. Webster.<eos> Stolen from the firm.<eos> By whom?<eos> That's what I want to know.<eos> By whom?<eos> Whom?<eos> Vera, get a hold of yourself.<eos> Nobody else ever will.
He's alive and well, a nice, clever boy.<eos> What do you want him for?<eos> What do you mean, what for?<eos> I miss him.<eos> And I have decided to send him abroad.<eos> I have there... a sister married to a professor of chemistry. They have no children.<eos> Just what I thought - you will drag him into your circle.<eos> No, rachel.<eos> I won't give you KoIia!<eos> I won't.
Nothing.<eos> As far as the Iaw is concerned, you just don't exist.<eos> You are an outlaw, a runaway revolutionary.<eos> You show up, and you'II be thrown into prison.<eos> - You'II take advantage of my situation?<eos> - I will.<eos> - You wouldn't do that.<eos> - I would.<eos> - You will give me KoIia!<eos> - I won't!
- Why not?<eos> - I've had enough of her here.<eos> - I won't let you go alone.<eos> Oh, girl...<eos> I haven't time to talk to you.<eos> Have you time to bring up KoIia?<eos> - He doesn't need much of my time.<eos> - He'II need more than I do.<eos> - You'II go abroad with Anna.<eos> You will.
Looking at the cake is like looking at the future.<eos> Until you have tasted it, what do you really know?<eos> And then, of course, it's too late.<eos> Too late.<eos> We have won battles against armies. And now one man defeats all my knights.<eos> He's a mighty opponent.<eos> A hard man.<eos> i'll go myself.<eos> The King must not engage in single combat. i'll go again.<eos> No, i will.
For some reason, the lever wasn't pulled.<eos> The transmitter with a thermite charge.<eos> Hold these.<eos> "To bypass trembler switch, cut wires in following procedure."<eos> Cutters.<eos> Screwdriver.<eos> That's it. Let's get out of here.<eos> James, help!<eos> - James, I won't make it.<eos> - We both will.
Well...<eos> What do you want to know for?<eos> I believe it's a good idea to teach the children to return kindness for kindness.<eos> Who would be responsible for the benefits this lake could bring us?<eos> Well, I'm the one who says it's okay to fish.<eos> Mr. Stockton's plant manager if you want to drop him a letter when you get back home.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Children.<eos> And don't forget to mention me.<eos> Oh, we won't.
What you said is true, but I didn't realize it.<eos> I was writing that letter... and enjoyed myself.<eos> Yes, I felt almost cheerful.<eos> My heart was full, my mind active, I was living.<eos> I thought I was suffering, but really I enjoyed it.<eos> I enjoyed my situation, my misery, my cigar.<eos> Oh, Olga, forgive me, for God's sake!<eos> I wanted us to part, at least I thought so.<eos> But I won't bear our parting...<eos> No, I won't.
Quiet...<eos> Must you do this to me?<eos> Calm down, please<eos> It's not as bad as you make it<eos> You're exaggerating. We haven't come to such odds<eos> We've been through difficult moments before<eos> We'll grow old together<eos> I won't leave you<eos> You won't?<eos> But I will!
Now you just take care of yourself, honey.<eos> I will.<eos> Well, that's settled.<eos> Now all you have to do is sign the papers... and pay over that nasty old money.<eos> It's pretty hot out there, isn't it? Yes.<eos> It is 15 degrees warmer than usual for this time ofyear.<eos> - Is that a fact?<eos> - Yes. Now here's the inventory.<eos> Now you must promise to be extra careful with the Myerson's effects.<eos> Oh, I will. I certainly will, ma'am.
Dad wants to talk to you.<eos> He wants me to come to Southampton for Easter.<eos> - Oh, hi, George.<eos> - Hi, Josh.<eos> You mad at me?<eos> Mom says I should apologize.<eos> I think you should apologize because you want to not because of your mother.<eos> - What if I don't want to?<eos> Then don't.<eos> - Okay, I won't.
He'll get in there.<eos> He'll get in there.<eos> We should have put the big one there.<eos> At speed, he'll get in. - What?<eos> - He will. - He will? - He will.<eos> Come here, dipstick!<eos> I'll show you if he'll get in or not!<eos> You'll be out of a job! Find another garage, dipstick!<eos> He'll get in here?<eos> Will he?
Might give us away.<eos> Sit down and zip your lip.<eos> And, now, you listen to me!<eos> Here. Give me that. Come on!<eos> Come on.<eos> Hurry up!<eos> - From Cartieris? - Yes.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> And that too, eh?<eos> - No. I'll give´em to you.
I know.<eos> Hold On!<eos> I do not hope.<eos> Honey, I'll walk you home.<eos> Come on ...<eos> You should try to lift it ...<eos> Miss, can I take her to the following bus station.<eos> - Able I can take -.<eos> That's where I go.<eos> Well, I'll River Street.
They're touched with humanity.<eos> And some of the noble virtues of humanity. Rage, anger, hatred.<eos> Homicidal hatred.<eos> You've given them something to hate!<eos> Do you want to live?<eos> Do you? Then they will have to fear you as they fear me.<eos> I want no part of this.<eos> You have no choice.<eos> I told you a ship will be coming.<eos> It will, the supply ship, but not for two years.
Do you know of a police station around here?<eos> That's not where you'd want to go!<eos> How about police headquarters?<eos> That'd really please the inspector...<eos> She's worked so hard on this.<eos> Yes, you're right.<eos> He must've shot the hostage.<eos> How come he's so calm about it?<eos> ! So now WE start shooting?<eos> Well, I won't.
- Yes, my wife did.<eos> - Little boy or girl?<eos> - That's terrific.<eos> It's a girl.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - We're sorry to bother you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Will you give our best to her?<eos> - I will.
Oh, it was great, great...<eos> Capital of nowhere, if you know what I mean.<eos> - Put those sacks in the kitchen.<eos> - Yeah, "put the bags in the kitchen"<eos> Hey why don't you come and watch us fix the pool, that should be some kind of a laugh.<eos> Busy, busy, busy!<eos> Aren't you finished with that thing yet?<eos> Listen, if you're so God damn smart why don't you come up here and fix it yourself?<eos> Davey, go show your father how to do it.<eos> All right then, I will!
Well, what do you think?<eos> - I like it. I think it's terrific.<eos> - Look at that. No ruffles at all.<eos> Red.<eos> I might've known it would be red.<eos> It's pink, Mama.<eos> What Tommy gave me, Mama.<eos> Aren't they beautiful?<eos> I can see your dirty pillows.<eos> Everyone will.
"at the marriage of their daughter Erin."<eos> What's Grandpa doing up in the attic?<eos> I expect he's looking for that old suit to wear at the hard times dance.<eos> He couldn't find his head if it wasn't fastened on.<eos> - Where you going?<eos> - Out to exercise Blue.<eos> Well, then how come you're all slicked up?<eos> I'm not all slicked up!<eos> - Well, I'll go with you.<eos> - No, you won't!
How should I say that?<eos> It's your duty to deal with him.<eos> I'll deal with Gheghe.<eos> I promise you, I'll make this wretch's life a living hell.<eos> That's all.<eos> - What happened to the boy?<eos> - He is in a foster home.<eos> Good.<eos> - I hope we stay friends.<eos> - Yes, we will.
- What are you doing?<eos> - Let him go get some fresh air!<eos> It's good for his health.<eos> - Go get Ippolit.<eos> - Won't even think of doing it.<eos> - I repeat.<eos> - You don't have to!<eos> - You'll take the first flight. - I will do just that!<eos> - Fly away!<eos> - I will!
I don't call that a distance when you keep tromping on my heels.<eos> - Why are you rubbing up against me?<eos> - What the hell do I need you for?<eos> But you are!<eos> - Are you afraid of getting lost?<eos> - There you go sounding off again!<eos> I'm not afraid of getting lost, but I'm a little nervous about crossing that river.<eos> It's all right for you, you can swim, but I can't swim one stroke.<eos> Will you shut up for at least a minute?<eos> No, I won't!
You arrange to billet us with one of them.<eos> Only not too ugly, I mean a woman that wouldn't give a man a stomachache.<eos> And somebody that's not over 70?<eos> If possible, a younger one would be better.<eos> Got you.<eos> - May I go into action?<eos> - Do it.<eos> But I have a feeling that you're going to let us down!<eos> Me letting you down?<eos> Of course you will.
Let's go.<eos> Let her go.<eos> Don't forget to write.<eos> Our family learned a lot that fall.<eos> About life, about loss, but mostly about loving, thanks to Olivia, and to Calico.<eos> - Daddy?<eos> - Yes, Elizabeth?<eos> When I get married, do I have to leave here?<eos> - You'll probably want to, honey.<eos> - No, I won't.
THE KID HAS NO PEP<eos> You play defense now.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Stand still.<eos> I dreamed of a new move.<eos> You're the defender.<eos> In my dream, I just slipped by.<eos> will you do it with me?<eos> will you stand still?<eos> will you?
Hello?<eos> I want to speak to Don Vito.<eos> Hey, Pepe, stop that will you?<eos> My mother could play the harp and she's still trying to teach me.<eos> I said stop it.<eos> Here they are.<eos> Him, who's he?<eos> One of the Marsigliese's men. The Marsigliese's supposed to come in person.<eos> Where is he?<eos> He won't.
You mean you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why don't you tell your boys to just sit this one out?<eos> You love to make it happen, don't you?<eos> You having any of it?<eos> Well, sir, you're... ... aprettyoldman .<eos> Yeah, I'm 30 years older than you are. Had my back broke once and my hip twice.<eos> And on my worst day I could beat the hell out of you.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> You will.
I am Jyunai Asada from the Totomi-administration.<eos> I am Itto Ogami.<eos> Master Gemba Sawatari would like to meet you.<eos> He told us to find you.<eos> Am I gonna meet him?<eos> Yes.<eos> Please come with us.<eos> Will he come?<eos> He has to.<eos> If he won't, we...
- They suspect us<eos> - I said so<eos> Emile told them about the cows<eos> And that he'd seen us set fire to the haystacks<eos> They found bike tracks by the car<eos> We're going to prison.<eos> They're going to lock us up<eos> - Not without the body<eos> - They'll find it, I know they will<eos> They will...!
No, there'll be nothing left.<eos> Don't worry about a thing, Mom.<eos> I feel fine.<eos> MIKE:<eos> I'm famous.<eos> I'm a TV star.<eos> MIKE:<eos> Wait till the kids back home hear about this.<eos> MRS. TEEVEE:<eos> Nobody will.
You have one simple alternative, Commandant.<eos> You can transfer to a frontline combat unit.<eos> My cooler is your cooler.<eos> Klink doesn't scare easy.<eos> Not easy, but fast.<eos> I will use one of the cells for an office until my job here is finished.<eos> Ja, ja.<eos> May I ask what the dynamite is for?<eos> You may not.<eos> Then I won't.
After his death, his mother took the body to friends of hers here in the village.<eos> I watched as they buried him here.<eos> Why didn't you report it?<eos> What interest could you possibly have had in the death of a 5-year-old boy?<eos> Madame Malik was captured by your men only hours later.<eos> I put the whole incident out of my mind until I heard the announcement on the radio.<eos> Have the coffin taken to the capital.<eos> I do not know what to say, Your Excellency.<eos> I've never had an experience like this before.<eos> Nor will you ever again.
You have proof of all this? Yes.<eos> Josef managed to get this letter out on microfilm.<eos> The disdain in which he must hold me. Because I loved Carlotta, it follows automatically I must love you.<eos> Am I so hard to love?<eos> There's been no one since Carlotta.<eos> Then you are missing a great deal.<eos> Don't feel sorry for me.<eos> I have known many women.<eos> I just haven't allowed myself to become involved.<eos> I won't ever again.
And someone else was there. A soldier.<eos> A man?<eos> Of course, he was a man.<eos> It was only a dream.<eos> Yes...<eos> I understand.<eos> What I don't understand is where were you all night.<eos> Now you'll have to get married, and posthaste!<eos> Come hell or high water, I won't get married!<eos> Oh yes, you will!
All right, all right.<eos> Hold it.<eos> Kinch, get on the radio to the underground.<eos> The girl, Lisa, knows the mine area. We'll need at least two men that the Krauts have never seen.<eos> Right.<eos> I still say this job's a bit out of our line.<eos> Yeah, it sure is.<eos> Do I have to repeat the orders that were given to us when this happy little band of wandering minstrels was formed?<eos> Sir, all I'm trying to...<eos> HOGAN: Okay, I will.
