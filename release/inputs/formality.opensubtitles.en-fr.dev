If I'm not back in an hour, my army will attack.<eos> You must be Gaia. - I'm...<eos> - I know who you are...<eos> Wanheda.<eos> You helped my people find the bunker.<eos> Thank you for that.<eos> And you gave the flame to an unworthy king, who saw it destroyed.<eos> I am not as grateful.<eos> Let's see what all the fuss is about.<eos> After you, Wanheda.
"No one but us saves ourselves.<eos> We ourselves must walk the path."<eos> Not too late to change your mind.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> You can still stay, you know?<eos> I'm not a quitter.<eos> Thanks for understanding.<eos> Where's Monty?<eos> Unloading the rover.<eos> We're leaving it behind for you, by the way.
He's overdosing on your damn jobi tea.<eos> Let him go, Monty.<eos> Move!<eos> Come on, Riley.<eos> Come on.<eos> Harper, get the med kit out of the Rover.<eos> Look at him.<eos> Look at his face.<eos> He's at peace.<eos> What's the matter with you?
No one's saying it's gonna be easy, but we need to make the people listen to reason.<eos> Someone still needs to get Raven.<eos> I'd like to volunteer.<eos> And I'll join you.<eos> No. Someone else can go with him.<eos> Mom, look, Raven needs our help.<eos> I know the way to the island.<eos> I need to do this.<eos> Well, you be safe.<eos> There'll be a place for both of you when you get back.

I told you, we will find our humanity again.<eos> I need you to pull 81 names from the bowl.<eos> Abby... When that door closes today, I need to be on the other side.<eos> Please.<eos> I just got you back.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> I love you, Marcus, but I made my decision.<eos> My life isn't worth more than theirs.<eos> I need you to pull 81 names.<eos> Sir, can I talk to you?
Doug McCrae.<eos> We don't have to do this.<eos> Please. No one wants this, but this has to be done.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> Jaha has a plan to save us, but we have to stick together.<eos> When those doors open, follow my lead.<eos> It's our best chance.<eos> That's enough.<eos> We can't do this.<eos> I don't know about you, but I am not about to be led to the slaughter.
Oh, and for what it's worth, I dropped a little extra something in the mail this month.<eos> Thought it might help with the orthodontist bills.<eos> You wanna help?<eos> Come and fold some laundry.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> Lazy Bones just barfed in the kitchen.<eos> James Maddox-- born August 1970.<eos> I don't know.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Does this look like the face of a traitor to you?
The attackers were all wearing balaclavas.<eos> We have proprietary mapping software that can recognize sufficient facial contours through a soft fabric mask.<eos> - Ah.<eos> Remarkable.<eos> - Another trade secret.<eos> You tell your leadership I'll be adding it to my bill.<eos> I have to get back.<eos> The FBI's investigating how our chip ended up in Arkani's hands.<eos> I was forced to make certain arrangements.<eos> I told you, I don't know anything about a missing timer chip.
I was forced to make certain arrangements.<eos> I told you, I don't know anything about a missing timer chip.<eos> Here's a tip, Mr. Maddox.<eos> Next time you wanna appear innocent,<eos> - don't run from the FBI.<eos> - It was stupid, okay?<eos> I thought they were process servers sent by my wife.<eos> We're in the middle of a nasty divorce.<eos> I was trying to avoid going back to court.<eos> It's been a tough few months for you, James.
You lost your family, you lost your job, started drinking again.<eos> I wouldn't betray my country.<eos> We talked to Blackthorn.<eos> You had access to that chip.<eos> My brother was a Marine.<eos> He died in Kandahar.<eos> You really think I'd put this on my arm and dishonor his sacrifice by giving terrorists classified intelligence?<eos> I don't think you gave it to them.<eos> I think you sold it to them.<eos> Look, tell me the truth now, and maybe I can still help you.
That makes no sense.<eos> Why would the NMB single out Agent Navabi?<eos> They're in a black SUV, no rear plate,<eos> - shattered rear window.<eos> - All right, sending an alert to local law enforcement now, rolling all backup units to your location.<eos> Reddington, we need your help.<eos> Samar's been abducted.<eos> - The NMB just took her.<eos> - Slow down.<eos> I'm putting you on a speaker.
I'm putting you on a speaker.<eos> We're sending you everything, all the search results for possible NMB members coming into the country, all the flights and profiles we've ruled out.<eos> Maybe we missed something.<eos> Have you identified anyone other than Farook?<eos> No.<eos> My program's vetted tens of thousands of possible candidates but only one real suspect so far,<eos> - and Agent Navabi cleared him.<eos> - Who?<eos> His name is Yusuf Tillisi.<eos> His photo was part of the file we just sent you.
His photo was part of the file we just sent you.<eos> But Samar spoke to him-- said it was nothing.<eos> Yusuf Tillisi isn't a terrorist.<eos> He also isn't Yusuf Tillisi.<eos> His real name is Ezra Mandell, an operative for the Mossad.<eos> Samar knows him.<eos> She's worked with him.<eos> Why would she lie about that?<eos> To protect her fellow countrymen.<eos> To prevent you from linking the Mossad to the attack on Arkani's operation.
Let me speak to her.<eos> Can we trace the call?<eos> I'm sure they're already on the move.<eos> We gotta do something.<eos> Gotta get her back.<eos> She's an operative, Levi.<eos> She knew the risks.<eos> - I'm not letting her die.<eos> - You said it yourself-- the wrong step now could jeopardize the lives of thousands of innocent civilians.<eos> Hey, neither of you is gonna do anything.
I might have him leaving the hostel on 92nd.<eos> On the ground!<eos> On the ground!<eos> Move.<eos> Move!<eos> Move!<eos> Look out!<eos> Hey!<eos> Drop the bag!<eos> We're ready for you this time, Jonathan.
- Bobby's lost six pounds.<eos> Ah, now, two million people may watch the inauguration, but the dance floor's all Miriam cares about.<eos> And my girl and I are gonna tear it up.<eos> - Uh, sir, sir.<eos> - Huh?<eos> Huh?<eos> What's wrong with him?<eos> Sir, there's a... situation.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I would've told you about it earlier, but--
Marlin, call security.<eos> No, just... give us a moment.<eos> You and I are even.<eos> - Not quite.<eos> - The hell we're not.<eos> I halted my presidential campaign and launched a Senate hearing into Alexander Kirk's links to terrorism.<eos> And in exchange, you received a generous donation and an appreciable bump in the polls, and now look what's happened.<eos> Robert, the man you're replacing as the leader of the free world has a legacy he'll want you to help burnish by keeping certain people and policies in place.<eos> He'll want favors.<eos> To get them, this is one of the things he'll have to do for you.

I've been waiting a long time for this, for us, for you.<eos> But...<eos> I am in love with someone else.<eos> ♪ and if we can stop a restless night ♪<eos> It was Reddington.<eos> He got the President of the United States to pardon me.<eos> How does he do that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> And right now, I don't care.<eos> I'm just glad I can finally say... it's good to have you back,
I've got no idea.<eos> So I've just been, like, regressing.<eos> I can't deal with this shit.<eos> I just want to hit pause.<eos> I don't want this election to fucking happen, so I've just been regressing, and I'm just watching the dumbest shit I possibly can.<eos> You know, morning time, those stupid talk shows to get soccer moms' day started.<eos> You know, they have all those non-thinking stories.<eos> "You love him. He's your best friend.<eos> But did you ever wonder, what does your dog do when you're not home?"<eos> "The next video may surprise you."
It's natural.<eos> I just eat everything that makes my sugar/salt go like,<eos> 'Yeah!<eos> Whoo!<eos> It comes right in, a nice roll of fucking flab."<eos> No, it's ridiculous.<eos> I know nobody wants to be fat, so I'm not shitting on anyone.<eos> But don't fucking come at me like it's my problem, and I need to fucking rewire myself. No.<eos> You're overweight, okay?<eos> There's plenty of things that can help you out.
That's something you fucking deal with.<eos> I don't have to completely rewire myself.<eos> You know, it's just a bunch of sixes pissed off that they're not getting treated like a ten, you know?<eos> At some point, you've just got to acknowledge what you are.<eos> You're a six.<eos> I'm sorry, all right?<eos> Nobody jerks off to a six.<eos> That's the deal.<eos> Unless you work with her.<eos> If you work with her, you know, she's got that one outfit, you know, it just does something for you.
Just get in the fucking car.<eos> You're gonna make the cops come!<eos> Get in the fucking car.<eos> I swear to God, just get in the fucking car.<eos> Oh, take your seat belt off, you fucking Mary.<eos> I'm going right down the street."<eos> Right?<eos> And then what happens?<eos> You get out on the road, you realize you're way more hammered than you thought.<eos> Who was always there for you?
Make no mistake, this is a burger joint.<eos> It's always been a burger joint.<eos> We did that breakfast thing as a favor.<eos> We were just trying to freak out IHOP.<eos> 'Oh, we're doing it, too!<eos> We're doing it, too! '<eos> Your own mother won't make you pancakes at three o'clock in the afternoon, okay?<eos> So get your fat ass or your drugged-up ass down here before 10:30.<eos> We decide. It's our place.<eos> We tell you what the fuck we're making, all right?"
If you could just get past it and maybe lose a couple of friends here or there... I am telling you, you wouldn't miss them.<eos> You know when you'd miss 'em?<eos> When you went to a baseball game and there wasn't those 100 people in the upper deck trying to get the wave going.<eos> Right?<eos> You wouldn't have people getting mad 'cause someone's sitting during a song, like, "That's offensive to me, even though I don't know the issue!"<eos> Right?<eos> Nashville, a little pull back on that one.<eos> A little pull back.<eos> It's about police brutality.<eos> It has nothing to do with you and your beautiful white world, and mine, right?

I don't give a fuck if you watched every episode of McHale's Navy.<eos> This is still not about you.
I have no idea."<eos> No evidence.<eos> No evidence. Maybe...<eos> Maybe, like, a flip-flop, right?<eos> Like an Ed Hardy shirt just... floating by.<eos> I'm controlling the media and nobody knows about it, right?<eos> And as I sank the ships, I would be building exact replicas at the same time, right?<eos> So I'd be eliminating people while creating jobs.<eos> You guys have no fucking idea what's going on.<eos> All of you just realize, like, "Wow, man, the traffic's easing up.
It's just different degrees.<eos> Right?<eos> Like, me, I'm racist, like, at the end of the day.<eos> Like, I'm a great fucking guy,<eos> I don't give a shit who you are in the morning.<eos> You're eating your cereal. "Hey! How are you?<eos> But as the sun starts to go down and the fear starts coming up, that's when you start thinking the worst of people, right?<eos> I know, nobody's gonna be honest.<eos> I don't give a fuck who you are.<eos> Twelve, midnight, in a parking garage by yourself, whatever is walking at you, there's no happy thoughts.
I've just got to do this.<eos> When you talk about race and that shit as a white dude, you've got to go easy.<eos> You know, because very easily it starts feeling like a meeting. You know?<eos> Whenever I start hearing, like, "Yeah!<eos> All right!<eos> That's when I go, "I've got to pull back.<eos> People aren't seeing what I'm saying.<eos> I wore a country shirt. Things are getting a little off the rails here."<eos> Can I get back to Kanye West?<eos> Half of you have probably downloaded his shit. All right? All right, here we go.
Nobody's watching white dudes. Right?<eos> White dudes, too many of 'em gather and somebody pulls up,<eos> "All right, break it up!<eos> Keep it moving!<eos> Get out of here!"<eos> Getting pulled over for no fucking reason, none of that shit.<eos> You're a white dude.<eos> It's just an open field.<eos> Anything you think, "Hey, I'm gonna do that."<eos> No one's stopping you.
No one's stopping you.<eos> You just start running.<eos> Next thing you know, you're handing out buttons, you've got your own uniform.<eos> You're starting a fucking war, right?<eos> All Kanye West is allowed to do is fuck up an award show every three to four years.<eos> Make a public service announcement a little awkward for Mike Myers.<eos> That's as far as he's ever gonna get.<eos> I know, I know. You don't believe me.<eos> Dude, okay, next time Kanye's going off on himself,<eos> I'm telling you, just close your eyes, forget it's him and really listen to what is coming out of this guy's mouth.
Twenty to 25 million copies is Michael Jackson Thriller, okay?<eos> One of the greatest artists, one of the greatest albums of all time.<eos> Six to nine million in sales, that's like Hootie The Blowfish Cracked Rear View Mirror.<eos> Now, if you guys were at home in your apartment or your fucking barn, whatever it is you do down here... sitting there with your lantern... and you're sound asleep... next to your favorite bale of hay.<eos> You're sound asleep... and someone runs in at three in the morning.<eos> "Dude, run down to the bar!<eos> It's the next Michael Jackson, I swear to God!"<eos> You would consider it.<eos> "Michael Jackson, I've got to fucking see that."<eos> But if somebody woke you up, like,
"Michael Jackson, I've got to fucking see that."<eos> But if somebody woke you up, like,<eos> "Dude, you've got to see this guy!<eos> He's the next Hootie The Blowfish!" Right?<eos> You'd smash him over the head with your fucking lantern, or whatever you've got.<eos> Why don't his fucking kills count?<eos> Dude, Stalin, he even killed his own friends.<eos> Hitler didn't even do that.<eos> You go duck hunting with Stalin. You thought you were in with him.<eos> He's taking pictures with you and shit.

They built it a house. I don't know why.<eos> They live in trees.<eos> It was probably the guilt of putting the thing in fucking jail, right?<eos> Whatever.<eos> It was a two-bedroom.<eos> It sounded like it was in the kitchen.<eos> And you just hear this thing... in this house at night, just going...<eos> And that was the end of the video.<eos> That was the end of the video.<eos> And, like you, I was sitting there, like,
You can't go to the airport, going through that fucking security.<eos> Right?<eos> Once he takes his shoes off and that thumb comes sticking out, it's fucking over!<eos> It's over.<eos> You keep it below deck.<eos> You keep the fucking thing below deck until you get out to international waters.<eos> Then you're fine.<eos> It's captain's law.<eos> "Come aboard," right? And have the thing sit down.<eos> Other boats going by are looking at you, like, "Is that a gorilla?"
Could've just taken her with me.<eos> You can prepare all you want.<eos> Aren't you gonna say, like, "Go, child? You're being ridiculous."<eos> But the feeling can still hit you, out of nowhere.<eos> If you're having second thoughts, we could bring your patient here.<eos> No, I told you, we've got a girl who needs a throat transplant and a donor in the same exact hospital.<eos> We can't risk moving either of them.<eos> I know.<eos> I just meant...<eos> So when it hits you, when your mind shuts down, when you open your mouth and no words come out, the good news is...
Did I tell you that?<eos> Double digits, he kept saying.<eos> I mean, he was having the time of his life up on that mountain.<eos> "Just one more run, Dad.<eos> Just one more run..."<eos> Eric, I'm afraid we have some difficult news.<eos> We've looked at Brian's scans, and, unfortunately, Dr. Corridan was right.<eos> There's nothing that we can do for your son.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> We are here... because we wanted to talk to you about... donating your son's organs.
- I understand how difficult this is...<eos> - Difficult?<eos> If you understood what you were asking, you wouldn't...<eos> Mr. Young...<eos> I know what we're asking.<eos> When all you want is to have him back, to hold him.<eos> I know the thought of letting any part of him go feels... impossible.<eos> You're the only that can make this decision.<eos> We understand that.<eos> We wouldn't ask you to do something that you're not comfortable doing.

Uh, throat... transplant.<eos> Supposed to be a throat transplant.<eos> It just got scrapped.<eos> Total laryngectomy not an option, huh?<eos> I was a surgeon.<eos> That was many lifetimes ago.<eos> Really?<eos> You gave that up for this?<eos> Well, this is not all that different.<eos> People come to you in need, you provide them comfort.
There are no other options.<eos> We do the laryngectomy, Caroline lives.<eos> It's that simple.<eos> We're going to Baylor.<eos> It's what she wants... what we all want.<eos> We'll fix it.<eos> We will fix her voice.<eos> Listen, what Dr. Avery means is that...<eos> I have an idea is what I mean.<eos> I told you that I don't break my promises, right?
At the table.<eos> I... I-I still don't know if I can get approval.<eos> Yeah, well, luckily, you don't have to.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> It's my name on the hospital.<eos> As an Avery, I officially grant us permission to make history... together.<eos> At the table.<eos> Exactly.<eos> She is gonna do great.<eos> Dr. Kepner and I will be sure to update you as soon as we can.
He should know where the fallback safe houses are.<eos> Sorry, hate to state the obvious, but his memory has been wiped.<eos> How is he going to be useful at all?<eos> I remembered things right away.<eos> Roman might, too.<eos> Roman is our best bet.<eos> We get him to talk, hopefully we'll get Patterson back.<eos> If she isn't already dead.<eos> Don't move.<eos> It's nice to meet you, Special Agent Patterson.
Can you tell me where you are?<eos> We have to find him.<eos> Are you a pirate?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You're funny.<eos> Is that your treasure?<eos> It's shiny.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> Yep, I'm a pirate, too.<eos> Sorry, is my daughter bothering you?
Can you pull up the text from book one?<eos> Just did.<eos> Okay, wait.<eos> If we convert the entire message to numbers, then have the computer scan the correlating pages looking for any coherent combination of...<eos> It worked!<eos> Got it, 465 Willets Point Boulevard, Queens.<eos> It's an auto shop that belongs to a woman named...<eos> Charly Evon.<eos> Right, let's bring her in.<eos> Ms. Kamal, I need to speak with you.
I will do whatever it takes to get you reinstated.<eos> I'll talk to the head of the NSA.<eos> Yeah, and they'll deny any knowledge of me and Zero Division.<eos> Just... just go find Patterson, okay?<eos> What do you know about...<eos> Shut up!<eos> Are you slow or something?<eos> I think I made it pretty clear I'm not answering any of your questions.<eos> I'm loyal... unlike your children.<eos> First, Jane turned on you, and now it sounds like Roman did, too.
First, Jane turned on you, and now it sounds like Roman did, too.<eos> So what makes you think Borden's gonna be any different?<eos> Or any of your other "followers"?<eos> Everyone... will leave you!<eos> Because you're...<eos> Where is he?<eos> I don't know, I never seen him.<eos> Then why did we find his car at your shop?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'll tell you what we know.
They will torture him day in and day out, just like they did to me.<eos> This is why Roman needs to be interrogated elsewhere.<eos> She has no objectivity...<eos> All right, you hand him over to the CIA, you lose me.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I'll walk.<eos> He stays, Nas comes back, or... you can find yourself a new Assistant Director.<eos> May I have a word?<eos> Roman, it's okay.<eos> What the hell has gotten into you?
That's why I couldn't marry you.<eos> It might all come out at the court tomorrow.<eos> Karev, what are you about to do?<eos> I'm going to - the district attorney's tonight, and I'm gonna take the plea.<eos> - He's going to prison.<eos> - When?<eos> It's just us now.<eos> There were five of us, and it can't be just me.<eos> Mr. Karev?<eos> He'll see you now.
That means he's giving testimony.<eos> So that means that he's in court, and he didn't take the plea, and he's not in prison... at least, not yet.<eos> Disposition.<eos> Oh.<eos> Okay. On it.<eos> Looks like criminal proceedings have been concluded, and... indefinitely postponed.<eos> So that means the trial's been cancelled.<eos> Which means that Alex took a plea, which means that Alex is in prison.<eos> Hey, this doesn't make any sense to me.<eos> Does this make sense to you?
First day.<eos> Exciting.<eos> - Hmm. - I love first days.<eos> - Such a feeling of...<eos> - Yeah, this isn't gonna work.<eos> Oh, no, no. No, don't...<eos> The valve replacement and the neuroblastoma debulking are happening around the same time, but I need to see both, so I'm moving one.<eos> Oh, and this amputation's got to go...<eos> Oh, no, no, no, you don't want to do that.<eos> What is wrong with you?
There's the heartbeat.<eos> It sounds really, really good.<eos> Is my husband here?<eos> Okay, breathe, breathe, breathe.<eos> The baby's coming, but you're not fully dilated.<eos> Films coming up.<eos> Pelvic fracture along with bilateral hip dislocations.<eos> Is that the femoral head inside the pelvis?<eos> The pelvis is broken, trapping the baby's head.<eos> Mindy, we're gonna take you for some CT scans.
Oh, that's unfortunate.<eos> That was my valve replacement.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah. It went great.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> It was scheduled for right now, the next surgery.<eos> Oh. Maybe you misread the board.<eos> I wrote it on the board.<eos> Well, maybe you miswrote it.<eos> Look, I would open him up again for you, but, you know, that kind of thing could get me arrested, so... Cheers.
Oh, right, yeah.<eos> You probably can't tell me anything, anyway.<eos> I mean, who am I?<eos> I'm not her family, just a taxi driver.<eos> That's cool.<eos> I get it.<eos> Just kind of got invested.<eos> We almost made it.<eos> Almost.<eos> Well, listen, I'm gonna order a head CT for you.
Just for the birth.<eos> Your labs look good.<eos> Just waiting on your head-CT results.<eos> Any word on the lady and her baby?<eos> Jury's still out.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You know, today started out so good.<eos> You know, I pulled up, she was, like, huffing' and puffin'.<eos> I told her, "Sit in front, sit in front," you know, so she could recline?<eos> And I said, "I'm gonna get you there. I got you."
I'm gonna pop in there, okay?<eos> - That would be amazing.<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> Oh, and, apparently, we need to hire a new Peds Surgery Chief.<eos> Seems ours went up the river.<eos> Murphy, um, can you go make sure that Mindy is set up in the scanner?<eos> You're not welcome on my case.<eos> I'm not actually asking.<eos> It's my job.<eos> Well, I'm actually telling you.
Was there a problem with the way I arranged the board this morning?<eos> Uh, you used lower-case letters.<eos> So?<eos> It's still legible.<eos> It's a little passive-aggressive, don't you think?<eos> - Mm. - We prefer caps.<eos> Chief Bailey told me to handle the O.R. board as I see fit today.<eos> Is that right?<eos> It is.<eos> Then, I'll leave you to it.
It's a terrible imposition.<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> You...<eos> It's not a big deal.<eos> You are welcome.<eos> It's just y...<eos> That was my last yogurt.<eos> I will go to a hotel.<eos> Just go to a store.<eos> He looks miserable and he's scared to death for you, and I don't want to lie to your husband anymore, so can I just tell him something, please?
What happened?<eos> Uh, rib fractures must've punctured a lung.<eos> Anything more from the chest tube?<eos> Bleeding slowed down.<eos> Only 400 cc in the pleurovac.<eos> Yeah, we'll need to stabilize his ribs.<eos> In the O.R. I'll join you.<eos> And before you tell me no, I spent all day rearranging my schedule, thanks to you.<eos> I was hired here to do a job, and I think it's time...<eos> I would love to have you.
Um, she's closing her right now.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Uh, when can I see her?<eos> Is she...<eos> When will she wake up?<eos> Will she wake up?<eos> We don't know.<eos> We have to see how she responds.<eos> And the baby?<eos> Dr. Robbins has asked me to tell you... your baby is in surgery.
'Cause I can't just go home and wonder, you know?<eos> It's, uh, still a question mark.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Oh. Damn.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Night.<eos> Night.<eos> Sir?<eos> That kid in the bed next to you, the one who couldn't breathe?
She's not out of the woods yet, but... everyone's still alive.<eos> Good. That's good.<eos> I'm gonna turn in, if that's all right.<eos> Good night.<eos> They're trying to be happy.<eos> Trying to do better, be better, feel better.<eos> Hey, Dr. Robbins, wait up.<eos> I've been awake for more than 48 hours, so I'm gonna...<eos> This'll just take a second.<eos> - I wanted to thank you.
Trying to do better, be better, feel better.<eos> Hey, Dr. Robbins, wait up.<eos> I've been awake for more than 48 hours, so I'm gonna...<eos> This'll just take a second.<eos> - I wanted to thank you.<eos> - What?<eos> Murphy told me you let her run with that baby from the trauma.<eos> That's the spirit.<eos> That's really putting my method to work.<eos> Good to have you on board.
You said you were taking a plea.<eos> I did.<eos> Are you in hiding?<eos> Are you evading the law?<eos> Are you on the lam?<eos> ! Alex. I can help you, but, I mean, I have kids here.<eos> Stop it.<eos> I went down there.<eos> I talked to the D.A.<eos> I have to advise you, Dr. Karev, that talking to you without your lawyer present just isn't...
But who is that?<eos> Is he the one you like?<eos> - Mom!<eos> - What?<eos> Look at him.<eos> Ma, okay.<eos> Everyone, thank you. You can go now.<eos> I r... Go now.<eos> - Yeah, well, I'm... I have things to... - Yeah.<eos> - Lovely to meet you.
- How?<eos> Ma'am, I know it hurts, but if you don't lay still, you're gonna hurt yourself a lot more... please.<eos> - What's her name?<eos> - What?<eos> - Her name. What's her name?<eos> - Uh, Annie Banks.<eos> Shh. It's okay.<eos> I got you.<eos> Shh. Look at me.<eos> It's okay. I got you.
- What?<eos> - Her name. What's her name?<eos> - Uh, Annie Banks.<eos> Shh. It's okay.<eos> I got you.<eos> Shh. Look at me.<eos> It's okay. I got you.<eos> Annie, it's okay.<eos> It's okay. Look at me.<eos> It's okay. I've got you.
Damn it.<eos> No, look, she'll come around, mate.<eos> No, no, it's the razor wire.<eos> Dr. Burkes to oncology.<eos> Dr. Burkes to oncology. Oh. So, now my fetoscopy is in OR 3?<eos> I'm glad I... glad I checked the board.<eos> You would have figured it out if you had walked into OR 2 and found a bowel obstruction.<eos> - Hmm. You do this everywhere you go?<eos> - Do what?<eos> Turn the place against you.
Breast cancer?<eos> But...<eos> But there are no lumps.<eos> I...<eos> I understand.<eos> It's a particularly aggressive form of cancer that presents as external skin reactions more often than lumps.<eos> Oh, dear God.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Now, you'll have to have a full work-up, at which point we can discuss our options.<eos> I'll be able to refer you to local specialists.
I am so sorry.<eos> Now, you'll have to have a full work-up, at which point we can discuss our options.<eos> I'll be able to refer you to local specialists.<eos> You're in Hawaii, I believe?<eos> I know a terrific group of oncologists out there on the Big Island.<eos> And I'll be more than happy to travel to you for surgery.<eos> That's if... if you'd like.<eos> You would?<eos> You're Maggie Pierce's mom, so, yes.<eos> Would you like me to grab Maggie for you?
What are you calling this, again?<eos> This is called inflammatory breast cancer, or IBC.<eos> It's a local form of the disease.<eos> Maggie's gonna have a million questions.<eos> Will you help me tell her?<eos> Can you do that?<eos> Of course.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I'm sorry if I pushed.<eos> What's between you and Dr. Webber
She could fire me.<eos> - I wouldn't cry. - No.<eos> You'd be terrified.<eos> Because then, you would have to face it.<eos> Face what?<eos> If Bailey fired me, you and I would be an option.<eos> We could date.<eos> We could kiss.<eos> We could... actually... be something.<eos> So screw you.
In 1949, Edward Murphy conducted a rocket-sled experiment to see how much pressure a human being could withstand.<eos> Good morning.<eos> I've organized the monthly rotation schedule, I got up to speed on all the upcoming general elective surgeries, and I have some ideas about which residents are ready for the next phase of Dr. Minnick's training.<eos> Um, I could run that by you, or...
Well, this morning, I would say that we're winning.<eos> Now, gosh, if you'll excuse me, children, Mama's got to go do surgery.<eos> - Aah!<eos> - Ohho-ho!<eos> Good morning.<eos> Kepner.<eos> April.<eos> How's your new job going?<eos> So busy, as I'm sure you know.<eos> Dr. Webber, can I talk to you for a sec?
Um, it's about your partial colectomy today.<eos> It's now Ben Warren's.<eos> - I beg your pardon?<eos> - Start to finish.<eos> I'd like Dr. Warren to scrub in as primary surgeon.<eos> You'd like?<eos> And you can assist and help...<eos> only when requested... but it will be Dr. Warren's O.R.<eos> Why don't you let Bailey take this one?<eos> Because I've assigned it to you.
No, no, no, no!<eos> Dr. Edwards is taking over this case now, from start to finish.<eos> Thank you for finding it for her.<eos> No!<eos> I started it.<eos> I get to finish it!<eos> I love gallstones!<eos> Yes!<eos> You will get your turn, Dr. Murphy, and when that happens,<eos> Dr. Edwards will be there to support you.
Yeah, but why is a resident listed as a lead surgeon on a lap chole on a peds case?<eos> Damn it, Minnick...<eos> I didn't want you "out of the way."<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> Anastomosis looks...?<eos> Uh, it's good, good.<eos> We can pull out the trocar.<eos> Let me see. Okay.<eos> - You fired me...<eos> - I didn't fire you.
Who gave you permission to let a resident operate on a 9-year-old?<eos> We're implementing phase two of my program...<eos> No, you're not implementing phases on a kid.<eos> Look, he's really big for his age.<eos> It's a lap chole.<eos> It's a simple procedure that Dr. Edwards is perfectly capable...<eos> You're not a peds surgeon.<eos> You are a sports-medicine ortho surgeon.<eos> I am scrubbing in.<eos> I was trained in general surgery, just like you, and I teach for a living.
No, you're not implementing phases on a kid.<eos> Look, he's really big for his age.<eos> It's a lap chole.<eos> It's a simple procedure that Dr. Edwards is perfectly capable...<eos> You're not a peds surgeon.<eos> You are a sports-medicine ortho surgeon.<eos> I am scrubbing in.<eos> I was trained in general surgery, just like you, and I teach for a living.<eos> I taught five lap choles last month, but if it will make you feel more comfortable, then, please, join us, Dr. Robbins.<eos> I'd love to have you.
I need to go dictate the post-op report.<eos> Thank you, everyone.<eos> It's a really simple surgery.<eos> I just make a tiny, little hole, and in that hole, I insert my camera and all my instruments...<eos> Okay.<eos> ...and you just end up with an itty-bitty scar right there.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> I think it's time to take you up.
Thank you, everyone.<eos> It's a really simple surgery.<eos> I just make a tiny, little hole, and in that hole, I insert my camera and all my instruments...<eos> Okay.<eos> ...and you just end up with an itty-bitty scar right there.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> I think it's time to take you up.<eos> I will come and talk to you when we're done.
I prefer an infra-umbilical incision.<eos> You can give him .5 milligrams...<eos> - Uh, Edwards?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Rein it in.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Her vitals look good.<eos> How are you feeling, Lynne?<eos> Any pain?<eos> Lots, thanks to you.
Hard to breath!<eos> She's tachycardic.<eos> Pressure's down.<eos> I need an EKG and a portable X-ray!<eos> Is it another M.I.?<eos> Uh, Dr. Pierce, there's gastric fluid in her lungs.<eos> The esophageal stump must've perfed into her chest.<eos> My staples didn't hold.<eos> Lynne, there's been a complication.<eos> We have to take you back to the O.R. right away.
I stapled as quickly as I could.<eos> - I know.<eos> - So, what?<eos> Dr. Grey can staple better than I can now?<eos> Lynne is prepped and ready.<eos> Thank you, Wilson.<eos> Dr. Pierce, you can go.<eos> What?<eos> This is my revision.<eos> I don't need you.
You got the damn cancer?<eos> We got the damn cancer.<eos> You got it?<eos> Well, Dr. Wilson and I did.<eos> Full excision, good margins.<eos> We still need to run some tests, but it appears as though you are cancer-free.<eos> What's your name again?<eos> Hemostasis was established, and the patient was sent to post-op without complications.<eos> Dr. Webber?<eos> May I, uh... May I run something by you?
Are we gonna do a kidney transplant?<eos> Technically, a kidney recovery and a transplant.<eos> So, who thinks they're ready to run lead on those?<eos> I'm not ready.<eos> That is the right answer.<eos> - It is?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Okay, great. I am not ready.<eos> Put your hand down, intern.<eos> None of you are ready, but you are ready to do as much of it as you can under the extremely close supervision of an attending with the reminder to pass it off if you need to, which means you'll be that much closer to being ready.
You got to interrupt her.<eos> She'll never stop.<eos> I'm not the one in charge.<eos> They are.<eos> If you don't have anymore questions, then Dr. Edwards and I will see you in surgery.<eos> Uh, just one thing... Tell my son it is mandatory to kiss his mother before she goes under the knife for him.<eos> - Stop!<eos> - It's mandatory, dude.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Uh, Doctors Karev and Webber will be in in a minute to prep you for surgery.
- Thanks.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> That was good, but don't be afraid of taking the lead.<eos> Embrace it.<eos> Be assertive.<eos> Riggs finishing up the cardio consult at bed 5, but I think it's gonna be...<eos> Make it hurt... They make...<eos> They make it hurt.<eos> Ma'am, can I help you?
They... they come and they go and they crack the whip.<eos> Who's, uh...?<eos> - No help.<eos> Do you need something, ma'am?<eos> Ma'am, you can't be back there.<eos> - Uh, snakes...<eos> - You might need to call security.<eos> This... Uh... There's no snakes here.<eos> - There's no... There's no snakes...<eos> - Okay, - we're gonna get you over to someone.
I'm one of Chris' doctors.<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> I hit so much traffic on the way over here, and I...<eos> So, he's not in surgery yet?<eos> Well, if he is then I'm late, because I'm his surgeon.<eos> Good.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, I haven't missed it?<eos> No, you haven't missed it.<eos> I can take you to him.
Oh, hi.<eos> I hit so much traffic on the way over here, and I...<eos> So, he's not in surgery yet?<eos> Well, if he is then I'm late, because I'm his surgeon.<eos> Good.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, I haven't missed it?<eos> No, you haven't missed it.<eos> I can take you to him.<eos> - Yes, please. Thank you.
Good.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, I haven't missed it?<eos> No, you haven't missed it.<eos> I can take you to him.<eos> - Yes, please. Thank you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> BP looks good.<eos> You're ready to go.<eos> Well, we need to start prepping you, too.
This is her mother. Okay.<eos> Good work, DeLuca. See?<eos> Problem solved.<eos> You're very impressed with yourself.<eos> Eh, a little bit.<eos> Ms. Nolan.<eos> Yes?<eos> Gwen.<eos> The police said someone found my daughter. Yes.<eos> We just have a few questions before we take you to her.
We need another one right now.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You talking about my son?<eos> Hold on.<eos> You're talking about Chris.<eos> You were told to leave.<eos> What happened?<eos> What happened to Cynthia?<eos> What is it?<eos> I can't discuss their conditions with you.
I wanted him to stay right where he was.<eos> I wanted Minnick to add value, but she wouldn't work with him.<eos> So, you sided with Minnick and tossed Richard aside?<eos> No.<eos> Look, I had a choice to make, Grey, and I didn't want to make it, because, yes,<eos> Dr. Webber built this place.<eos> But I have to keep building it.<eos> So I do that by asking myself 100 times a day<eos> "What would Richard Webber do?"<eos> But how did Eliza Minnick win you over so quickly?
I don't think so.<eos> I think you want an excuse to worm your way back into their lives.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I swear.<eos> I can't take back the stuff that I've done.<eos> But I can do this.<eos> I just want to do something good.<eos> If you really want to do good, never tell them about this.<eos> You do it anonymously and walk away.<eos> They never have to know it was your kidney, and they never have to see you again.
Well, this looks like the residents pulled it off without a hitch.<eos> You missed a few hitches.<eos> I went and talked to Grey.<eos> Yeah? She coming back?<eos> No, she is not.<eos> Bailey, you... you are ridiculous.<eos> You're not just costing Meredith time and money, you're costing yourself and the hospital.<eos> Oh, no, not me.<eos> You are.<eos> She chose you.
And they shouldn't.<eos> - Hey! - Hey. You busy?<eos> Yes, I was just about to paint a wall and watch it dry.<eos> Well, Karev and I talked the "surgeons of tomorrow"<eos> through a kidney transplant today.<eos> And?<eos> And you being here instead of there is a waste.<eos> I mean, also, it's your choice.<eos> It's also stubborn.<eos> Bailey spoke to you?
You care about the students maybe even more than I do.<eos> And you have this brilliant way of making your victories their victories, and you're good for this place, and you're good for them,<eos> - and they should know that. - Arizona, stop.<eos> - I just think it's not...<eos> - I need you to stop... so I can kiss you.<eos> - Oh. - Stop.<eos> Claire... how are you feeling?<eos> I'm just gonna check your bandage, okay?<eos> I... I wasn't... uh, I wasn't gonna put in... in the order.<eos> They switch you on, and they, uh, switch you off, and they've got di... diagrams a... and conditions, and...
- and they should know that. - Arizona, stop.<eos> - I just think it's not...<eos> - I need you to stop... so I can kiss you.<eos> - Oh. - Stop.<eos> Claire... how are you feeling?<eos> I'm just gonna check your bandage, okay?<eos> I... I wasn't... uh, I wasn't gonna put in... in the order.<eos> They switch you on, and they, uh, switch you off, and they've got di... diagrams a... and conditions, and...<eos> Claire, we're monitoring your pacemaker... - Hmm? - ...and it's working beautifully.<eos> And we've put you on a... some medication to calm you down.
From... from who?<eos> It was an anonymous directed donation.<eos> It's a perfect match, and Chris is responding really well.<eos> I can't believe it...<eos> That people are... are that good...<eos> That they can be so good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, it looks like she's responding to meds.<eos> That's good.<eos> The family has you to thank... for that pacemaker idea.
There's an old story of a father who had two sons.<eos> When he knew a civil war was about to break out, he sent one son to fight for the North and one to the South.<eos> He figured if he had sons on both sides, there'd be a better chance one would survive because when you fight a war at home, the casualties are your neighbors your friends, your family...<eos> ...leaving you all alone.
Not in a dirty wound like this.<eos> We need to do a delayed reconstruction, not a primary bladder repair.<eos> No.<eos> Reconstruction should happen now...<eos> We have a penetrating wound to explore.<eos> ...before the tissues become edematous.<eos> Okay, what about this?<eos> Webber and Kepner explore the wound as Avery evaluates the burns to determine the need for more coverage.<eos> The other Avery can do a perineal evaluation, and after a full assessment, it'll become clear how to proceed.<eos> I jus... You know, Minnick said that we should work the problem with you.
There's a high probability of tears.<eos> He thinks he's a cardio god or something, like he knows everything.<eos> When I'm the peds guy, I know things... if he would just listen.<eos> The guy's a total snake, just like you said.<eos> Well, I definitely never said that.<eos> Oh! Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God! You're back!<eos> - Oh, actually...<eos> - Ahh! I'm so happy!<eos> Oh! Dr. Minnick's method is awesome, but I've really been wanting to do it with you.
I was teaching a capable resident, same as I always have, long before Minnick.<eos> No. No.<eos> In there, that was... that was different.<eos> Look, we can win this thing, all right?<eos> There are strings that I can pull, you know?<eos> - I have a voice.<eos> - Jackson, don't do it.<eos> It'll tear you and your mother apart.<eos> Tear us apart?<eos> What about you?
It'll tear you and your mother apart.<eos> Tear us apart?<eos> What about you?<eos> You're her husband.<eos> You don't think this whole thing is pushing you away?<eos> You don't know the first thing about my relationship with your mother.<eos> And you don't know my mother.<eos> I mean, you don't know this is what she does.<eos> She finds a weakness, and she exploits it.<eos> And she's gonna fight you.
All the way here, she's gonna fight and fight...<eos> We fell in love fighting over this hospital.<eos> We'll be okay.<eos> Yeah, except she's not gonna stop, all right?<eos> She's gonna fight until she wins, no matter the cost.<eos> Don't let her.<eos> Well, your father's out of surgery.<eos> His recovery is going to be a long haul, but he will recover.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> I can take you to see him.
Your repeat scans came back, and they show a good response.<eos> You are her star patient.<eos> Ooh, and the prize is a mastectomy.<eos> Your reconstruction is gonna go perfectly.<eos> It'll be my best work.<eos> Today, we just focus on getting your pre-op taking care of, and we get our oncologist up to speed.<eos> Did you want, um... Maggie here before we continue?<eos> Um... Diane, you didn't tell her yet?<eos> It's too much stress.<eos> Which is exactly why she needs to know, because it's gonna be stressful enough for you.

- This is a big...<eos> - Maggie.<eos> - This is a big renovation.<eos> - Maggie.<eos> I-I don't want to discuss this with you.<eos> Just... leave it alone.<eos> Fine.<eos> Well, I hope you'll enjoy being a nice, self-involved, lonely person with an incredible rack.<eos> Pretty straightforward modified rad.<eos> I'll remove the breast tissue, then do a lymph node dissection, and leave you to the reconstruction.
Fine.<eos> Well, I hope you'll enjoy being a nice, self-involved, lonely person with an incredible rack.<eos> Pretty straightforward modified rad.<eos> I'll remove the breast tissue, then do a lymph node dissection, and leave you to the reconstruction.<eos> Sounds great.<eos> Need something?<eos> Yeah, I'm on your service today.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> I didn't request a resident.<eos> Dr. Minnick assigned me to you.
It's... You know that's not what I mean.<eos> Okay. I'll try.<eos> I will leave it alone.<eos> I will try.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Just tell me, are they gonna be huge-huge?<eos> Maggie, please.<eos> Just trust me.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> I don't need to remind you of HIPAA, right?
- Right.<eos> So, were you there when he first connected a child to his mother's circulation?<eos> Okay, let's all focus, please.<eos> - Was I there?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I did most of it.<eos> DeLuca, take her to C.T.<eos> - and page me when she's done.<eos> - All right.<eos> Dr. Clatch, I'll be happy to show you where you can wait, okay?
He needs to back her up.<eos> She is the head of the neuro department.<eos> She is the boss, and she's stubborn as hell, too.<eos> Dr. Clatch, I know Dr. Shepherd very well, and you can trust her.<eos> She's not gonna be talked into anything that she doesn't want to do, okay?<eos> Okay, come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> I worry you won't survive the surgery.<eos> Based on your age alone...<eos> it could kill you.
I thought you weren't doing the surgery.<eos> I never said that.<eos> You said you thought it was a bad idea, and I practically assured Lewis that you wouldn't.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> She's my patient.<eos> I thought you made a decision or at least consult with him before you changed your mind.<eos> Okay, enough!<eos> Stop it, Owen!<eos> No more!<eos> All your pre-op tests came back looking terrific, so just two more things before we get you home for some much needed rest, okay?
Okay, enough!<eos> Stop it, Owen!<eos> No more!<eos> All your pre-op tests came back looking terrific, so just two more things before we get you home for some much needed rest, okay?<eos> Number one...<eos> no eating after midnight, right?<eos> And number two...<eos> we are gonna tell Maggie.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I told you, uh... after the surgery,
Diane, unless we tell Maggie.<eos> - You can't do that.<eos> - Of course I can.<eos> I'm your doctor.<eos> But it's not your business.<eos> And it would be an irresponsible course of treatment.<eos> Okay, Maggie is your only support system here.<eos> I-I'll just get another doctor, then.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> She told you I was the best 'cause I am.
And it would be an irresponsible course of treatment.<eos> Okay, Maggie is your only support system here.<eos> I-I'll just get another doctor, then.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> She told you I was the best 'cause I am.<eos> You trusted her then, and you trust her now.<eos> I understand. It's okay to be afraid.<eos> You don't have to be afraid for Maggie.<eos> She's not scared of cancer.<eos> She would just want to fight this with you.

I didn't want to.<eos> And I certainly don't want to have to think about you all the time, trying to come in early, see your name on the board, come up with that one thing that's gonna make you smile so your eyes do that thing they do.<eos> Anyway, uh...<eos> so that's why I joke so much and to keep from having to say anything like this. -<eos> So, I don't have a good reason.<eos> I'm sorry. I wish I did.<eos> Okay, so you should ask me out to dinner.<eos> Do you want to go out to dinner?<eos> Yes.<eos> Dr. Grey, Dr. Pierce needs you.
Elsie and I came in an ambulance.<eos> Well, let me call you a cab.<eos> No, it's... it's fine.<eos> Just... tell me where I can get one.<eos> Well, just go out here, turn right, and at the corner.<eos> But, Dr. Clatch, please, let me just get you a...<eos> I have to figure things out for myself now.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Here.<eos> That's for you.
They are experimenting with humanized antibodies for late-stage cancer immunotherapy.<eos> A clinical trial.<eos> And it's successful?<eos> The trial's next phase was rushed into approval due to favorable outcomes.<eos> And your mom meets the criteria?<eos> Once we remove that met that's obstructing her bile duct, her liver enzymes will go down, and she's in.<eos> Um, Meredith doesn't feel that surgery is wise.<eos> Meredith is no longer on the case.<eos> And now that I know about this trial, there is even more reason to do the surgery.<eos> And I'd like one of you to do it.
- Oh, come on.<eos> You led the procedure that brought her LFTs down and got her the trial in the first place.<eos> A trial I never believed in.<eos> Yeah, well, you're the chief.<eos> Well, who's head of the board?<eos> - Now you care about that?<eos> - Never mind.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> She's in the waiting room.<eos> Don't want to bother you.
Maggie, you work with these people.<eos> How do you not know this?<eos> How we doing in here?<eos> Oh, been making a fuss.<eos> Um, we will need you to sign these forms.<eos> All of these?<eos> Yeah, well, the thing with clinical trials is they can list a million ways your body might react, but the truth is they just don't know.<eos> That's why it's a trial.<eos> You need to be prepared for anything.<eos> Let me... Let me walk you through this.
So I'm just breaking him in.<eos> Oh, you're the friend.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> No, no. He's the friend now.<eos> - No. Wait.<eos> What did he say about me?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> You can't trust anything he says.<eos> Other than he values you as a friend.
Oh, you're the friend.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> No, no. He's the friend now.<eos> - No. Wait.<eos> What did he say about me?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> You can't trust anything he says.<eos> Other than he values you as a friend.<eos> - Did he ask you to say that?
You got her number?<eos> She stuck her hand out. She wanted to help.<eos> Oh, yeah? Dennis, don't be jealous.<eos> You're still my sponsor.<eos> - You're doing great.<eos> - You know that's not what I meant.<eos> But thanks for the vote of confidence.<eos> I'm not into her, man.<eos> I got London, remember?<eos> Is everything okay between you two?
- Yes, hi.<eos> How are you, Diane?<eos> I'm well.<eos> I, um...<eos> Please, sit down.<eos> Why, didn't you give your name?<eos> Well, I was worried you wouldn't want me as a client.<eos> I wanted to get a chance to argue my case.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Why wouldn't I want you as a client?
I'm well.<eos> I, um...<eos> Please, sit down.<eos> Why, didn't you give your name?<eos> Well, I was worried you wouldn't want me as a client.<eos> I wanted to get a chance to argue my case.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Why wouldn't I want you as a client?<eos> Bitcoin.<eos> I thought it was all a bit too "disruptive economy" for you.
He found this on his computer.<eos> Who's the client?<eos> You understand I can't tell you.<eos> He's worried he'll be prosecuted if you know.<eos> But if you can make a deal...<eos> Okay. Can I take this?<eos> Come in.<eos> None of us want to go to trial.<eos> But for us, it's just about time and money.<eos> For you, it's about a life sentence.
There was concern I'm not bold enough.<eos> That's just constructive criticism.<eos> Everyone's getting it.<eos> I spoke to Marissa tod...<eos> Damn.<eos> I'm sorry, Maia.<eos> I forgot something.<eos> Marissa. I forgot Kurt called.<eos> - Could you return?<eos> - Yes, but Diane, there's someone on the line for you.
Hello?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> One second.<eos> Don't forget to monitor...<eos> My God, please, please.<eos> Contacted anyone yet?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Yes, we got ahold of his parents.<eos> Sorry, ma'am.<eos> We're calling to inform you that your husband was in a car accident.
He's going through surgery now.<eos> How bad is it?<eos> - Yes? Would you accompany us, please?<eos> Why?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We're detaining Miss Quinn as a material witness.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Actually, I don't know who you are, but yes, we are.<eos> Hold on, Lucca.<eos> She's gonna fuck you up.
No, you're not.<eos> Actually, I don't know who you are, but yes, we are.<eos> Hold on, Lucca.<eos> She's gonna fuck you up.<eos> - I can't go back to prison.<eos> - I know.<eos> You have it?<eos> - When?<eos> - Tonight.<eos> I'll come for you at 8:00.
What happened?<eos> We won the restraining order, so now they're prosecuting Lucca.<eos> - For what?<eos> - And they got assigned Judge Kassovitz.<eos> Yeah. The most conservative son of a bitch on the bench.<eos> - They're venue shopping. - Yeah.<eos> No, I'm coming in.<eos> I'll be there in 15 minutes.<eos> What's up?<eos> I'm tailing you.
You take the 35 years, they won't prosecute her.<eos> And how much could she get for perjury?<eos> If they wanted to be tough...<eos> I think, given the popular will, they might... five years.<eos> What do you want to do, Henry?<eos> Look, I am not going away for 20 years, okay?<eos> - I didn't do anything.<eos> - Then you won't go away.<eos> We're your lawyers.<eos> We will defend you.
Wow. That was surly.<eos> I'll funnel his postings through this forensic software for grammar recognition.<eos> Okay, that's useless.<eos> Did-did this guy ever talk about posting on other sites?<eos> - If we could cross-reference it...<eos> - Not to me.<eos> Wait.<eos> Go for Marissa.<eos> Yeah, I'll send him.<eos> Diane wants to talk to you.
We know him.<eos> - Back up! - Back up!<eos> Get back! Get back!<eos> Fuck the old way!<eos> No, hate, no speech!<eos> This way.<eos> Through here.<eos> - He's the hacker?<eos> - We think so.<eos> Why won't he talk to you two?
Isn't it great?<eos> All those people, so angry and excited.<eos> I'm the best thing that ever happened to them.<eos> And they got to pay me either way.<eos> Are you Edict776?<eos> Diane, where are the pleasantries?<eos> I've been living a very full life lately.<eos> So I've read.<eos> Your joke about dead children?<eos> - Hasn't been going well for you.
We love it in the tech world.<eos> Why not in the real one?<eos> But again, this is not my hack.<eos> Yes, I encouraged someone, but legally, I did nothing.<eos> Who have you encouraged?<eos> Do you know his name?<eos> - No.<eos> I know his handle.<eos> - Listen... we need your help, Mr. Staples.<eos> Diane. There's nothing I'd rather do than help you, after all we've been through, but I-I have legal troubles of my own.
My issue. What is the screen name of the hacker?<eos> - Him.<eos> - Or her.<eos> Or they.<eos> - Tarr19.<eos> - All right.<eos> And you will go online and ask him or her to meet about the blackout tonight?<eos> - I might.<eos> - No.<eos> One for you, and one for me.
Your Honor, this is a trick to get around the restraining order.<eos> We ask for immediate relief.<eos> I wish it were, Your Honor.<eos> But Lucca Quinn is a co-conspirator, and we ask that we be allowed to present testimony to support this contention.<eos> How long is it gonna take?<eos> The witness is right here now.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You had a meeting with Lucca Quinn, did you not, Mr. AUSA?<eos> I did.<eos> And what did she give you?
- Goes to motive, Your Honor.<eos> Sure.<eos> Go see what you can do with it.<eos> - Objection overruled.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Are you her ex-lover?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I'm sorry, I can't hear you.<eos> Yes.<eos> And did she break up with you?
As of now, Happy's apartment has a vacancy.<eos> He's been alone for 20 years.<eos> He's desperate for company.<eos> Last night, we played cribbage until midnight.<eos> This is my campaign manager, Allie Jones.<eos> My name is Gabe, Cabe.<eos> Cabe, Cabe Gallo.<eos> Why don't you ask her out?<eos> She's at least ten years younger than me.<eos> Everyone's at least ten years younger than you.
Thought, when you married the doc, that if you wanted, you could wear it.<eos> It's okay if you don't want to.<eos> I love it.<eos> Thank you. Just a little something for lettin' me shack up with ya.<eos> Speaking of shacking up, isn't that the cutie that's hot for your booty?<eos> Oh, man, I'm starting to sound like Toby.<eos> How do I look?<eos> How you doing?<eos> Good. Thanks.<eos> I-I'm so sorry to bother you at work...
I hear they have a fantastic vegetable lasagna.<eos> Oh, I love Italian food.<eos> With a last name like Gallo, how could I not?<eos> Um... Well, I'll see you soon.<eos> Have a good time today.<eos> "Have a good time today."<eos> Good time at what?<eos> What the hell does that mean?<eos> I don't know. I-I got nervous.<eos> She was begging you to take her to that Italian joint.
Exactly.<eos> An engine as strong as the truck's will super-cool the water pretty fast.<eos> Dramatically fast.<eos> That's how we'll freeze him.<eos> Cabe, this is where the rubber meets the road.<eos> When we start this process, your body temperature is gonna drop to unnatural levels.<eos> Your heart'll stop.<eos> Odds?<eos> Five percent... tops.<eos> I trust you kids.
Your heart'll stop.<eos> Odds?<eos> Five percent... tops.<eos> I trust you kids.<eos> Do it.<eos> I'll place the can when the water starts to freeze.<eos> I got to get the thermometer.<eos> Hey, roomie?<eos> We still got to finish Stratego, right?<eos> Cabe, I'm gonna do everything in my ability to bring you back.

This is ridiculous.<eos> You should be jumping at the chance to gobble up this little fella.<eos> The only reason you wouldn't feed would be because you're pregnant.<eos> But in that case, there should be a daddy snake down here with you.<eos> Oh... it seems daddy snake is up here with me.<eos> This is a problem.<eos> Got it.<eos> Drop your comms out for now.<eos> We don't need the others listening in to what's about to go down, in case it doesn't work.<eos> Hey, Cabe, we're gonna patch you up, warm you up, and you're gonna wake up, deal?
Well... looks like your ride's here.<eos> Sir, sorry.<eos> Liability rules dictate only family can come aboard.<eos> I am family; he's my father.<eos> Okay, get in.<eos> How am I doing, kid?<eos> Surgery went well.<eos> I'm, uh tracking your cardiac function with my own oxygen demand formula and ejection fraction composite, so I foresee a full recovery.<eos> So much for a relaxing day in the desert sun, huh?<eos> I should tell you that the others, they're concerned, so I should, um, uh... bring them in if you're feeling up to it.

I'm sorry I didn't use appropriate words before we stopped your heart.<eos> As you know, I have I have issues expressing myself.<eos> It's been more than "a pleasure" working with you.
Sure.<eos> I'm sorry I-I... I'm sorry I didn't use appropriate words before we stopped your heart.<eos> As you know, I have I have issues expressing myself.<eos> It's been more than "a pleasure" working with you.<eos> As I said in the garage, we could find another federal agent, but but, uh, we couldn't find another Cabe Gallo.<eos> Makes all the difference.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I know you care about me.<eos> It's much more than that.<eos> I love you, Cabe.

I love you, Cabe.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too, son.<eos> Oh, boy, look at this crew.<eos> Thought we'd bring our sunny day to you.<eos> We brought you some iced coffee.<eos> I think I'll try to avoid ice for a while.<eos> Makes sense.<eos> Hey, roomie, you might hear that I yelled at you a lot when you were dead.<eos> I was just motivating you.
I am.<eos> I have every right to be, but right now it's not about you or me or Tim.<eos> It's about... Cabe, so let's just... put it aside for the night and appreciate he's still with us.<eos> Agreed.<eos> You can talk to the doctor later.<eos> Let's try to keep Cabe company.<eos> You know, I was thinking, after all I've been through, that maybe I should ask that Allie girl out to that Italian place.<eos> Superlative idea.<eos> There you go. Get back up on that horse.<eos> I'm fine with it, but I'm reserving final approval until I determine whether she's good enough for you.
We have a private job to revamp their viticulture technology with selective harvesters and optical sorters.<eos> Can I have the shell?<eos> Please.<eos> Uh, real quick.<eos> Wait. Uh, Toby and I forgot my model for the sap flow sensors.<eos> What?<eos> The client's minutes away.<eos> But, uh, I'm sure there's a good reason.<eos> Uh, we were awake all night in a wedding venue rabbit hole.<eos> In other words, we spaced, but we'll get it and we'll meet you at the winery.
Well, that's just bad as North Korea.<eos> And Norteguay's been rattling their sabers at the U.S.<eos> ever since that last round of sanctions.<eos> Threatening to kidnap our scarediest geeks?<eos> But their threats are nonspecific, and their dictator, Alejandro Durante, he calls them "earth-shattering."<eos> Now, he's the kind of guy, he starves his own people.<eos> He feeds his enemies to his killer dogs.<eos> Oh, God, I hope it's not Norteguay.<eos> Lucinda? What exactly is going on?<eos> On behalf of our beloved leader, I welcome you to Norteguay.
The phosphorous looks good at first, but it dries sticky.<eos> Uh, feel free to look up my criminal record.<eos> I served ten months for counterfeiting perfect copper mine deeds.<eos> Couldn't be prouder.<eos> We can try your method.<eos> If it fails, you die.<eos> We have the chemicals in another room.<eos> It's a two-woman job.<eos> If that press isn't running within an hour,<eos> I'll send someone to encourage you to work faster.
Why would she flee her own country?<eos> Yeah. About that.<eos> We're in Simi Valley.<eos> That woman is a genius.<eos> She pulled off the Punxsutawney Peek-a-boo.<eos> You're impressed.<eos> Did Tchaikovsky get mad at Brahms?<eos> Yes, actually.<eos> Guys, we have Veronica and Paige.<eos> What about you?
I couldn't sleep last night.<eos> That's what happens when you realize that the men who want you dead know you're back in town.<eos> Not to mention they saw you with Scorpion.<eos> Our address is listed.<eos> Those guys shot at us twice already.<eos> When they came after us on the road, they thought I was alone.<eos> They had no idea I was part of a group that has government ties.<eos> They know that now, so they're not just gonna come barging in here... but at the same time...<eos> We're a bit in the crosshairs.<eos> I never wanted to put you all in danger.
It's always good to have you there as a buffer.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> Besides, it's good EQ practice for Walter, and who knows?<eos> Maybe he'll finally start acting like a... polite, normal human being.<eos> Attention, mole rats!<eos> They're called sandhogs.<eos> I am aware, but the nickname is illogical.<eos> There is no "sandhog" in the zoological taxonomy, and since they work underground, lack Vitamin D, and are prone to sallow skin like mole rats, a blind underground rodent is a fitting moniker.<eos> You must be Walter O'Brien.<eos> Heard a lot about you, apparently all true.
You must be Walter O'Brien.<eos> Heard a lot about you, apparently all true.<eos> Cabe Gallo.<eos> Homeland.<eos> Sorry about him.<eos> He's just, uh...<eos> There's no point in explaining.<eos> Call me Chief.<eos> I run this sandhog unit, and I suggest you use the proper term or one of my men might give you a matching set.<eos> I'll, uh, brief you over here.
Ground here is already weak.<eos> You know, we're right above the San Fernando aquifer, one of the largest sources of drinking water for Southern California.<eos> This is a problem.<eos> Cover subsidence sinkholes can occur anywhere excess water dissolves soluble rock below the surface.<eos> There is a strong likelihood a sinkhole could open up here.<eos> Like those giant sinkholes in Florida?<eos> Those things are portals to hell, only less hospitable.<eos> If we disturb the soil any further, we could trigger a cave-in.<eos> Stop the work.<eos> That man didn't hear you.
By my calculations, the sinkhole is spreading too fast for us to pump out the chemicals before the silo falls in.<eos> Then we only have one choice.<eos> We need to slow down the sinkhole.<eos> I know you have a God complex, Walter, but you're talking about stopping the earth.<eos> When sinkholes formed around the Dead Sea, scientists designed a canal to relieve water pressure and stop it from spreading.<eos> So, if we can create a relief well to drain out the excess water that is pooling underground, then we can slow it down.<eos> In the '20s, this area was full of wells that tapped into the aquifer.<eos> Even those that are a hundred yards away are strong enough to draw water from this area, reducing the saturation and slowing this collapse.<eos> Those wells are in sheds all over this valley.<eos> I could show you where.
Understood?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You guys finish over here yet?<eos> Outflow hose is ready.<eos> I still don't understand how you're pulling this off.<eos> If we explained, you probably wouldn't get it.<eos> He didn't mean it like that.<eos> Really?<eos> Then how did he mean it?<eos> Um... all he's saying is he's way smarter than you.
Sly, you got to get me out of here or I'm gonna drown!<eos> It's no use.<eos> We're running out of time here, kid.<eos> You got to think of something else.<eos> We have to cut it open.<eos> There's a power saw on the truck, but there's no electricity in here.<eos> Then we make our own energy.<eos> No time to explain.<eos> Go grab the power saw, a screwdriver from your toolbox, some oil and a lug-wrench.<eos> Cabe, we're gonna cut you out, but it could take a while.
Okay, out of my way.<eos> All right.<eos> Kid?<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Frank?<eos> Spin the lug wrench as fast as you can.<eos> Cabe, keep your fingers away from the edge of the grate.<eos> Just-Just hold on up there, Joe.<eos> No big moves, don't rock that boat.<eos> What if I try to reach you through the silo's interior?
We could use it to dissolve the steel wall and then create an exit without shaking the silo.<eos> That'll take time.<eos> We'll have to stabilize the silo or it'll fall in before we're done.<eos> But how?<eos> It's ready to topple right now.<eos> We secure it with cables.<eos> Cables?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> I'm about as crazy as the Italian engineers who secured the Leaning Tower of Pisa for 645 years.<eos> Is that a good enough of a test run for you?
And if the silo falls, authorities believe the worker will be unrecoverable.<eos> Oh, my God, we got to get there.<eos> Text Toby.<eos> We're on our way.<eos> What about the company following us?<eos> Let 'em follow.<eos> All right, we're making some progress.<eos> Just hold on!<eos> I got one last big breath and I'm under, kid.<eos> I'll have you out of there in less than a minute.
We'll deal with them later.<eos> That silo looks like it's about to give!<eos> Shake a tail feather, fellas!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Get it in gear!<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> I thought you guys came in to fix a leak in a pipe.<eos> Nice and easy, Chief.<eos> I'm spotting you.
But here's the thing.<eos> Her debts are now yours.<eos> Let me tell you my situation.<eos> I'm a single mom who waitressed up until two and a half years ago.<eos> I make less than six figures a year,<eos> I have four grand in my bank account.<eos> You want to set up a payment plan?<eos> Fine.<eos> You'll be whole by 2094.<eos> And why should I believe you?
Walter. Be careful.<eos> Your foot...<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Our money.<eos> Thanks to one hell of a con by my little girl,<eos> I am now free and clear.<eos> Speaking of which,<eos> I have a new birth certificate, driver's license and Social Security card.<eos> They're real McCoys, so you won't have any problems.<eos> I... don't know what to say to all of you.
I'm Mike Kresteva, head of the DOJ task force, and...<eos> I'm Spencer Zschau, Assistant United States Attorney.<eos> This firm is responsible for several major crimes, but we're gonna start by focusing on just two of them... bribery and tax evasion.<eos> One of the name partners in the firm,<eos> Adrian Boseman, accepted an $800,000 bribe to help a client evade taxes.<eos> Now, remember the burden of proof on a grand jury is low.<eos> Your job is merely to indict, not to convict.<eos> So please keep in mind you don't need to believe beyond a reasonable doubt.<eos> You only need to believe that the accused... could have committed a crime.<eos> Miss Tascioni, this is an order from a federal magistrate compelling you to assist in our investigation.
Purge all files.<eos> Understood.<eos> Activating.<eos> Congratulations, you just tampered with evidence.<eos> The Purge is a horror/sci-fi thriller premiering in 2013, starring Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey...<eos> Ada, no!<eos> Cancel!<eos> As the independent observer, this conversation is determined to be "not privileged."<eos> You're enjoying this.<eos> No, I'm working with you.
Are you helping your daughter feed us false information?<eos> No. What are you talking about?<eos> Travis Leopold.<eos> There was no bribe.<eos> He doesn't exist.<eos> Ms. Tascioni admitted it on her Ada device.<eos> Here are the two options.<eos> Either you're working with them, or your daughter knew you were wearing a wire and misled you.<eos> I have to see her.<eos> No. She can see you in prison.
He doesn't exist.<eos> Ms. Tascioni admitted it on her Ada device.<eos> Here are the two options.<eos> Either you're working with them, or your daughter knew you were wearing a wire and misled you.<eos> I have to see her.<eos> No. She can see you in prison.<eos> - We're having your bail revoked.<eos> - Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Let me find out what happened.<eos> - I can't trust you.
So what do we do?<eos> Well, he doesn't want a conviction.<eos> I like those earrings.<eos> - Especially the shape.<eos> - Thanks?<eos> I wish I could wear earrings like that, - but they make my face droopy. - Elsbeth.<eos> Right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You're amazing.<eos> Um, he wants to bankrupt you.
"In my next life, I want to come back as a shark."<eos> Great.<eos> Makes sense to me.<eos> - Marissa Gold, right? - No.<eos> Nella mia prossima vita voglio essere uno squalo.<eos> _<eos> So, he's pivoting?<eos> Exactly.<eos> No more black lawyers.<eos> - Now, he's going after you three.
Sir, please.<eos> It's not...<eos> - I hate him.<eos> - I see.<eos> Are you under the mistaken impression that you only defend people you like?<eos> No, I'm under the mistaken impression I don't defend anyone.<eos> I'm a prosecutor.<eos> Yeah, well, when you get this tortious interference nonsense dismissed, you can go back to prosecuting.<eos> Sir.<eos> I have to... apprise you of a conflict of interest.
- Yeah, I'm, not sure that I could be... objective.<eos> I agree.<eos> Stop dating her.<eos> Then you can be.<eos> You're late for court.<eos> Jesus Christ, where is everybody?<eos> It's 10:00 a.m. Am I right?<eos> You are right, Your Honor.<eos> The plaintiffs are ready.<eos> Good for you.
These three clients you lost, how important were they to your bottom line?<eos> Every client is important.<eos> That sounds like not very important.<eos> Objection.<eos> Lamely argumentative.<eos> Yeah, no, it sounded that way to me, too.<eos> How much money a year do you lose from losing these three clients?<eos> I guess... $1.3 million.<eos> But that's why we need to stop this leakage now, Your Honor.<eos> And didn't you just sign Chumhum, a massive social media empire worth $86 million a year to you?
We need to find out what he said to the grand jury about our firm.<eos> How do we do that?<eos> What did you say to the grand jury about the plaintiff's firm?<eos> Objection.<eos> Grand jury proceedings are under seal and cannot be made public, no matter how clever.<eos> - Ms. Tascioni thinks she is.<eos> - Sustained.<eos> That's sweet, complimenting me for being clever.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Nice to see you, Mr. Kresteva.
How many of their cases have you bankrolled?<eos> - Twenty-one.<eos> - No. 23.<eos> Wha... how do you figure?<eos> The appeal and the Christmas settlement.<eos> - No, that's 21.<eos> - No, 21 plus two is 23.<eos> - It's 21 period.<eos> - Okay, let's leave it at 21 or 23.<eos> What does Reddick/Boseman give you in return for this financing?
And I imagine you're going to promise not to ask questions about what he'll testify to?<eos> I'll go even further, Your Honor.<eos> I have just one question for this witness.<eos> Any objections, Counselor?<eos> Well, that depends on the question, Your Honor.<eos> Quite the suspenseful moment.<eos> Please, proceed.<eos> Mr. Rindell... good morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> What did Michael Kresteva offer you in exchange for your grand jury testimony?
Well, that depends on the question, Your Honor.<eos> Quite the suspenseful moment.<eos> Please, proceed.<eos> Mr. Rindell... good morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> What did Michael Kresteva offer you in exchange for your grand jury testimony?<eos> What are you looking at him for?<eos> I wasn't sure of the question.<eos> Well, then, look at me.<eos> What did Michael Kresteva offer you in exchange for your grand jury testimony?
And Mike Kresteva's here.<eos> Have him come in and hold my calls.<eos> So that's what that does.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> What for?<eos> I was just relieved of my duties.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> I mean, I'm sorry.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Little present for you.
That's a joke.<eos> I'm punchy today.<eos> I'm Federal Agent Madeline Starkey.<eos> And, why don't we have a seat and chat?<eos> There you go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm out of breath.<eos> So, Maia, thank you so much for coming today.<eos> Um, we really appreciate your help with this investigation,<eos> I know this has not been easy on you.
Wh-Where'd he kick you?<eos> Should I say he kicked me?<eos> What are you in for, son?<eos> Possession.<eos> Guard!<eos> I need my Purell.<eos> This is abuse.<eos> Dear God.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Did Alicia call you?
I don't want to hurt my dad.<eos> I know.<eos> But your proffer only covers you if you don't lie.<eos> If you lie to protect your dad, you might get him off, but you'll end up in jail.<eos> All rise.<eos> The Honorable Don Linden presiding.<eos> N-no, Steve, I have it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I guess I won that bet.<eos> Mr. Sweeney, how nice of you to join us again.
There was nothing to settle.<eos> But we talked.<eos> And we're back.<eos> Good. Good, good, good.<eos> So, Maia, I want you to take a look at your mother's calendar, okay?<eos> I think you'll see that you two have a few appointments listed over the years, and not just the gyno.<eos> See?<eos> For example, on October 3 you had another appointment with Dr. Regina.<eos> And, then, on October 23 you went with your mother to her dental checkup.<eos> And then on November 4, the two of you went to see a movie.
Yeah, well, why don't you take a good look at that and, put a check mark next to the ones that you remember.<eos> Well, the worry is not STD...<eos> Maia has a boyfr...<eos> What can I do to help, doct...<eos> Thank you.<eos> So you and your mom were together at these times?<eos> As far as I remember, yes.<eos> Well, here's the problem...<eos> It would be easier if you would just tell us a problem before there is a problem.<eos> Your mother wasn't with you at these appointments.
See's?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> - See's?<eos> - No.<eos> My husband picked out all the good stuff and sent me to work with the coconuts.<eos> What's your husband's name?<eos> Michael... son.<eos> Why?<eos> How long have you two been married?<eos> I googled you over lunch.
When was the last time the board met?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Um, a few years ago?<eos> If you have the answer you can just tell her.<eos> Well...<eos> Well... I think the last board meeting and only board meeting was June 18, 2011.<eos> Do you know of any other dates?<eos> Any more meetings?<eos> - No. - Okay.<eos> That doesn't bother you?
Hello, Officer Theroux.<eos> Hello.<eos> This is a familiar spot for you... Being questioned about police brutality.<eos> Objection.<eos> Argumentative.<eos> And rude. Sustained to the first.<eos> Overruled to the second.<eos> Officer, um, do you work out at Savoy's Gym?<eos> Yes, why?<eos> Do you recall yesterday afternoon sparring with a 19-year-old welterweight named Hector Peraza who, according to eyewitnesses, - knocked you out?
Mr. ASA, overruled. Do you see these lacerations, Officer Theroux?<eos> Those lacerations are in the same shape as this.<eos> The mouth guard at Savoy's Gym.<eos> You guys are good.<eos> So this was your 18th birthday?<eos> Yes. And that's when your parents gifted you the Rindell Foundation?<eos> Yes. My parents, they-they knew I was interested in Africa.<eos> I had read that malaria kills one million kids a year and that it could be prevented with mosquito netting.<eos> So they wanted me to run an effort to pay for the netting for 60% of African children.<eos> Well, that is a good cause, and thank you so much for doing that.
Maia, was he there?<eos> - Yes. - Okay.<eos> Well, that's not complicated.<eos> Okay. And Diane Lockhart, was she there?<eos> Yes, she was there, too.<eos> You sure you don't want one?<eos> They're delicious.<eos> From your husband?<eos> Okay. Now, did you hear Ms. Lockhart offer any legal advice to your parents?<eos> Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there.
Yes, there was.<eos> Your parents were there?<eos> Amy's parents were there?<eos> Thank you for being here.<eos> Yes, Sam and Connie.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sam and Connie.<eos> Now, were you living with Amy, at the time when you graduated from law school?<eos> - I was.<eos> - Did Amy. Ever ask you about the possibility of her parents investing in your parents' fund?
Who are you again?<eos> A partner here.<eos> Where does the drug possession come in?<eos> There was nothing in the crime report.<eos> Well, partner, I'm just theorizing here, but we were on our way to a chemsex party in Arlington Heights.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> We need to stop right there.<eos> You need to speak in hypotheticals,<eos> Mr. Sweeney. But... why?<eos> We can't put you on the stand knowing you will perjure yourself.
Richard Hess is a Florida real estate billionaire who's been sent to Chicago to vet... ambassadors.<eos> Don't act like that.<eos> What's the point of being rich if you can't buy what's for sale?<eos> An ambassadorship?<eos> I gave over a million dollars to his campaign PAC.<eos> Membership has its privileges.<eos> So work your magic and make these charges go away.<eos> I need to look clean.<eos> Then get Hess to testify on your behalf.<eos> This drug testimony - from Theroux hurts you.
Listen, Maia, I can think of a dozen reasons why you didn't let Amy's parents invest.<eos> First and foremost, you didn't want to mix up finances with love.<eos> That makes complete sense to me.<eos> You think so?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> You ready again?<eos> Last dentist visit.<eos> That's "just kidding."<eos> It's what the kids say.<eos> I wanted to thank you for you help. You're welcome.
It's what the kids say.<eos> I wanted to thank you for you help. You're welcome.<eos> And I wanted to let you know that no good deed goes unpunished.<eos> About an hour ago, some billionaire was named the next ambassador to Germany.<eos> I lost it.<eos> - I'm sorry to hear that. - I can't believe I wasted.<eos> Four months trying to learn German. Ich.<eos> Nicht.<eos> Well, I'm sure you'll survive.<eos> Also, it'll free you up for our lawsuit against Cook County.
But I'm a professional, and I can assure you this information will not change that.<eos> I will not stand for these personal attacks, especially from an outsider who thinks he's too good to eat the food here in East Peck and has his own cuisine shipped in from New York City.<eos> That is ridiculous.<eos> Oh, do you deny being seen around town with a Zabar's bag, eating bagels and whitefish and homos.<eos> It's pronounced "hummus."<eos> And I only ship in food because the mushy rings of white bread that they call bagels down here are a joke.<eos> Witch!<eos> Order!<eos> Mr. Segal, where are you going with this? Beyond Rutger Hiss' tainted testimony, the prosecution has nothing. - This case is over.<eos> Thank you! Josh, finally!
Wendy, I--<eos> You know you're pretty-looking and such, right?<eos> [scoffs] Titus, I've been hurt very badly in my previous relationships by guys who looked real good on paper.<eos> Guess what.<eos> Turns out you're not a good guy just 'cause you came up with a hot ad campaign for walnuts.<eos> But with Richard, I know what I'm getting.<eos> He won't cheat on me with my neighbor 'cause he can't.<eos> He can't scream at me when the Steelers lose.<eos> He can't flip my cereal bowl in my face and call me a dummy.<eos> A man flipped cereal at you?
He can't flip my cereal bowl in my face and call me a dummy.<eos> A man flipped cereal at you?<eos> 'Cause now I eat my cereal at home before I go to the prison.<eos> I'm in control for once.<eos> I'm not stupid, Titus.<eos> I know it's not a fairy-tale romance.<eos> We only get to see each other an hour a week. But that's why this is gonna work.<eos> If we only see each other one hour a week, he'll never realize what a useless piece of crap I am, and he'll love me forever.<eos> And that's what I deserve.<eos> [straining] Wendy... I'm gonna fix you. I'm gonna fix you!
We were way off.<eos> [in Spanish] I'm going to kill him!<eos> [in English] It's okay.<eos> You're gonna be okay. We're not letting the Reverend near you.<eos> [in Spanish] I just need to get near him!<eos> I'm hiding an icicle in my butt!<eos> When he comes at me, I'll stab him in the eye and drive it into his brain!<eos> I'm Kimmy.<eos> This is Cyndee.<eos> The Reverend wants to marry you, okay?
I'm Kimmy.<eos> This is Cyndee.<eos> The Reverend wants to marry you, okay?<eos> He thinks it'll make us jealous.<eos> Yeah, and I'd only be jealous if he married the cab driver from Wings.<eos> [in Spanish] Quick!<eos> Before the icicle melts, just tell me where to go!<eos> Shh, it's okay.<eos> [in Spanish] Let go of me!<eos> I don't know you. I don't understand you. But I'm not letting that monster hurt another person.
You're gonna marry him?<eos> [in Spanish] Now is the time, idiots!<eos> Ayúdame just got here. She doesn't know how to distract the Reverend by asking him to rank Kid Rock songs.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> [in Spanish] Never mind.<eos> I no longer have an icicle.<eos> You're welcome, sister.<eos> Did it work?<eos> Wendy.<eos> I don't know you. I don't understand you. But I'm not going to let that monster hurt another person.
I'm not signing these.<eos> I knew it!<eos> He told me you were still in love with him.<eos> Sure. If that's what you need to believe.<eos> [Wendy] Well, it is.<eos> And you can't stop me from seeing him because we're gonna be together forever.<eos> We may never get conjugal visits, but I can stay close to him because the Hampton Inn told me that I can buy a room, like a condo!<eos> You'll never get him back, if that's your crazy pipe dream, because he is not a fan of yours!<eos> Not a fan, Kimmy!<eos> I promised I wouldn't do this, but one of his very first compositions was a scathing haiku about... you.
So the band was right, the ex-wife was violent.<eos> Look at these.<eos> She was arrested for domestic abuse two years ago.<eos> I mean, charges were dropped, but...<eos> Detective!<eos> You're okay.<eos> What?<eos> Yes, of course I'm okay.<eos> Don't be so silly.<eos> Lucifer, I was really, really worried about you.
Meet Candy Morningstar.<eos> My wife.<eos> It's not how I'd hoped to announce it.<eos> I know it might be a tad surprising.<eos> No, why would I be surprised?<eos> That you disappeared after I almost died, and then waltzed back in married to a stripper?<eos> Exotic dancer, but, yes, I can explain.<eos> No.<eos> No need.<eos> I'm happy for you.
That you disappeared after I almost died, and then waltzed back in married to a stripper?<eos> Exotic dancer, but, yes, I can explain.<eos> No.<eos> No need.<eos> I'm happy for you.<eos> Really.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Am I bugging you?<eos> I'm totally bugging you.
Really.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Am I bugging you?<eos> I'm totally bugging you.<eos> No, I love that sound.<eos> - Oh. - Look, Detective, I had some family issues.<eos> And I-I went to Vegas to blow off some steam.<eos> One thing led to another, and...<eos> Look, I am sorry, I should've told you that I needed... time off.
Well, I don't get a lot of names at my job, so I'm super good with faces.<eos> - And other things. - Ah.<eos> This is fun, isn't it?<eos> Isn't this fun?<eos> Hmm? Murder, suspects, clues.<eos> Gosh, it feels good to be back.<eos> Right, I'm going to call Candy a cab, and then you and I can get down to brass tacks, yes?<eos> Actually, come to think of it, who watches over Trixie?<eos> Do you want to go splitsies on a nanny?<eos> Besides, I hear this case involves a band, so, lucky for you I bring my much-needed musical expertise.
Did you know he plays piano?<eos> Like, better than Elton Tom.<eos> I know plenty about music, thank you.<eos> Do you, now, Detective?<eos> Right, what's your favorite band, then?<eos> Oh, full of '90s jams, I see.<eos> The Bangles, N'Sync,<eos> Right Said Fred?<eos> - Give me the phone back.<eos> - I mean, seriously, Detective, your music queue alone is enough to disqualify you from this case.
- I mean, seriously, Detective, your music queue alone is enough to disqualify you from this case.<eos> You're not the one who's on this case, Lucifer.<eos> What?<eos> But what about our partnership?<eos> Our partnership ended when you ghosted me and the entire department.<eos> You can't just march back in here like nothing's wrong.<eos> You can't just grab what you want when you want.<eos> I'll just put that down there, then.<eos> You let me down, Lucifer.<eos> I mean, what good is a partner if I can't depend on you?

Ash's mediator won't talk.<eos> Well, because he's a lawyer.<eos> Yep, not without a warrant.<eos> Okay, will do.<eos> I know you're there.<eos> I'm a cop, Lucifer.<eos> You think I don't know when I'm being followed?<eos> All right, fair enough.<eos> Look, I'm simply here to help with the case.<eos> What, you mean the case that Chloe kicked you off of?
At least, Ash promised me... maybe I could be the manager someday.<eos> The point is, I helped them a lot.<eos> Ash and I came up with a plan.<eos> Buy all the albums himself using his ex-wife's money to inflate sales.<eos> Talk about self-promotion.<eos> All they needed was a little nudge.<eos> And it worked.<eos> I mean, we got on the charts and we started getting radio play, we were gonna be booked for this big tour.<eos> I mean, we were gonna make it so big.<eos> We have a photo linking you to the crime scene.
That's when I saw the police standing there, across the street.<eos> Over his dead body.<eos> It was the night the music died.<eos> Perhaps Marla didn't want to be the fifth Beatle.<eos> Looks like we have a new suspect.<eos> Oh, well, if that's the case, then you're welcome, Detective.<eos> It's nice to be needed.<eos> Look, go home.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Candy needs you more than I do.
I didn't kill Ash.<eos> Innocent people don't run.<eos> Or get a dead guy's blood on their guitars.<eos> Whoa, what?<eos> Ash's blood was all over your bass.<eos> I don't know anything about that.<eos> I-I ran because of these.<eos> What, you're making fake IDs?<eos> That's how I make rent, okay?<eos> How come you didn't tell us Ash wanted to kick you out of the band?
Yank like it's your last wank.<eos> Or better still, you shoot, Detective. Come on.<eos> Two birds, one bullet, what do you say?<eos> You okay?<eos> I think so.<eos> Yeah, that's because you shot me!<eos> Doug Kennedy, you're under arrest.<eos> There's not a scratch, Detective.<eos> Impressive marksmanship.<eos> Actually, I was aiming for you.
He's fine.<eos> Did you save him?<eos> Thank you! Oh! Oh.<eos> All... All righty. That's...<eos> His job is way too dangerous.<eos> I begged him to quit, but no.<eos> My hubby's all about his work.<eos> He is?<eos> Oh, my God, it's "Detective this," and "Detective that."<eos> Working with you means so much to him.
Working with you means so much to him.<eos> Well, he's got a strange way of showing it.<eos> Well, duh.<eos> Dude's totally messed up.<eos> But then, you probably already know that, huh?<eos> 'Cause you're kind of the reason why? What?<eos> Uh...<eos> Didn't you two just go through a super bananas situation?<eos> With like, poison?<eos> He kept saying how he almost lost you, and it was hell and stuff.
Didn't you two just go through a super bananas situation?<eos> With like, poison?<eos> He kept saying how he almost lost you, and it was hell and stuff.<eos> Yeah, i-it was bananas.<eos> It, it, I... went through a lot, and, um... And I...<eos> I guess he did, too. Great.<eos> Statement given...<eos> Uh, Candy darling, the detective's not a big fan of PDA.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'm just glad she's here for you.
I said I'd drive you to school.<eos> I never specified which one.<eos> So, play along, and I'll deliver my end of the bargain.<eos> - Mr. Morningstar? - Yes.<eos> Hey. Mr. Taylor.<eos> You're here for the Starford tour?<eos> I am indeed. I am indeed.<eos> And this little creature, who gets whatever she wants...<eos> Trixie Morningstar.<eos> Nice to meet you, sir.
Right, honey?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Look, I'm not good at listening.<eos> Or talking about emotion stuff.<eos> But I do know you don't let your girl go into enemy territory alone.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I guess networking is the new grieving.<eos> You're Trixie's moms, right?<eos> I'm the event coordinator here.<eos> I just wanted to tell you that we'd be so happy to have you as part of the family.
Exactly.<eos> Or just a...<eos> A stranger on a bus.<eos> My father would never use public transport.<eos> That song is completely unrealistic.<eos> - What song?<eos> - The song I hate almost as much as I hate these hypocrites, like God Johnson.<eos> Hypocrite?<eos> Hmm, I don't know.<eos> I see some similarities between the two of you.
That song is completely unrealistic.<eos> - What song?<eos> - The song I hate almost as much as I hate these hypocrites, like God Johnson.<eos> Hypocrite?<eos> Hmm, I don't know.<eos> I see some similarities between the two of you.<eos> That man is not my father.<eos> Well, good thing, 'cause he might be our killer.<eos> Whaaat? Oh, my God, Ella, how do you know that?<eos> I'll tell you how I know that, because our victim was bald.
It's very hard to get prints off a body, so I whipped out the ultraviolet alternate light source, and... boom, complete set on the victim's noggin.<eos> They match one Earl Johnson, wealthy oil magnate from Odessa, Texas. Huh.<eos> It says here his wife committed him a few months ago after he gave all of his money away and started calling himself "God."<eos> Mr. Johnson never said that he touched the victim's body.<eos> Left out the killing part as well.<eos> And proving he's the killer is the perfect way to expose his false idolatry.<eos> Right, shall we?<eos> No, we shan't.<eos> Because you spoke to him without permission, I had to apply for a special hearing just to interview him.<eos> That'll take at least a few days, so thank you for that.
Right, never mind.<eos> Maybe I can help.<eos> I did see him perform a miracle.<eos> Really?<eos> He scored me an extra Jell-O at snack time.<eos> Useless.<eos> Royal flush. Cheater!<eos> Red pubic hair!<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Billy, what did I tell you about throwing your underwear?
No, please, I have to save her.<eos> What do you mean, save her?<eos> It really is you.<eos> You son of a bitch.<eos> Why the hell would you get yourself committed?<eos> I did it to help the investigation.<eos> Hey. What do you think?<eos> It's a good likeness, isn't it?<eos> That's it, I'm pulling the plug.<eos> I'm getting you out of here, now.
Hey, Maze.<eos> You still want to help me?<eos> Okay, so that was "God" God back there?<eos> As in capital "G"? I didn't bow.<eos> I should have bowed.<eos> You should have spit in His face.<eos> Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.<eos> Then you're no use to me, Doctor.<eos> What on earth are you doing here anyway?<eos> Chloe sent me to check on you because she was worried.
Well, never mind that.<eos> What about our killer? Hmm?<eos> Did you find proof of Santa Claus?<eos> Time for your meds.<eos> Ooh, lovely.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Right.<eos> Unexpected perk of the place.<eos> Maybe it's a good thing there's another day on your 72-hour hold. You know?<eos> Maybe being here is the best thing for you right now.
I made it all up. I made it all up!<eos> I made it all up.<eos> Hello, son.<eos> Dad!<eos> See?<eos> I am the Devil.<eos> Tell me what you told the police.<eos> Only the truth. That you, Mr. Kringle, are a cold-blooded killer.<eos> What else? What do you want to know, Nurse Kipsy?<eos> Why aren't the drugs working on you?
She tortured me.<eos> So I decided to torture her.<eos> Pumped her full of drugs, drove her crazy. Preaching to the choir, sister.<eos> Evil parents deserve to be punished.<eos> You had every right to destroy her.<eos> But what about the orderly?<eos> He found out what I was doing.<eos> He... said he was gonna turn me in.<eos> I had no choice. No, he was innocent and you killed him, so I am gonna have to punish you.<eos> Why aren't I pulverizing you?
Well, if it's any consolation, you haven't exactly been yourself of late.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Listen, I wanted to ask you... what's the last thing you remember?<eos> I was in New Mexico for work,<eos> I was walking through this Navajo gift shop.<eos> I saw a cool belt buckle, so I picked it up, and... next thing I knew, I woke up strapped to a gurney next to you.<eos> Lucky you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, they, uh, they say we was arguing.<eos> If I did or said something to upset you, I apologize.
Previously on Lucifer...<eos> Operation "Help Lucifer Escape From the Hospital."<eos> And you, my dear doctor, are going to help me.<eos> Let's go.<eos> The three of you plan to use... this Flaming Sword to cut through the gates of Heaven and go home.
Looks like you're right.<eos> He's been dead about an hour. Oh?<eos> Impressive guess, Detective.<eos> Uh, I'm assuming from the... discoloration.<eos> Well, that wasn't a complete Dumpster fire, but now that we're finished, you can see yourself out.<eos> I'll do nothing of the sort. Fine.<eos> I'll show you out, if you insist.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> But the detective and I have got everything handled now.<eos> This is far too important to leave to just the two of you.
You looking for your brother?<eos> Or my m... um...<eos> Charlotte?<eos> Listen, um... are they here?<eos> Because I haven't been able to reach them.<eos> No, they took off.<eos> Couple hours ago.<eos> Of course they did.<eos> And why would they bother to let me know?<eos> I could try to call them for you.
Trust me.<eos> At least, not in the way you think.<eos> And if we are, well, obviously I lost.<eos> Because I'm here, with you.<eos> No offense.<eos> Yeah, none taken.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> They couldn't crack the passcode.<eos> But, uh, for what it's worth, I like you a hell of a lot more than I like your brother.<eos> I know everyone here except you.
No, no.<eos> No one's dead.<eos> We did this to each other.<eos> Though... when it comes to your case, I fear I may have, um... complicated things.<eos> Lucifer told him you used to screw.<eos> - Among other things. - Oh?<eos> Well, I guess that's that.<eos> No, that isn't that.<eos> I want to know why she's still upset with me.<eos> Since I'm not currently a practicing doctor of psychiatry, I don't have to lead you on this path of realization; I can just tell you.

Birthday reverse.<eos> Nope. Double 69.<eos> Oddly relieved that's not it.<eos> Ms. Lopez.<eos> We haven't really had the chance to meet.<eos> I know. I've been looking forward to a formal "hey-ya."<eos> - Uh, no, I see you're still working on the phone.<eos> I knew Chet well.<eos> Perhaps I could borrow it, maybe try some combinations?<eos> I see through you.
I know. I've been looking forward to a formal "hey-ya."<eos> - Uh, no, I see you're still working on the phone.<eos> I knew Chet well.<eos> Perhaps I could borrow it, maybe try some combinations?<eos> I see through you.<eos> I know you are waiting around for my boy Dan.<eos> Oh.<eos> Caught me red-handed.<eos> And even though most everybody is all like,<eos> "She a shark, "those dead eyes, don't trust her," when I look at you...
What happened to you?<eos> Oh, this. It's just a little fisticuffs between friends.<eos> I just had a very enlightening conversation with Charlotte Richards.<eos> Ah. Well, I've had my fill of enlightening conversations for today, thank you.<eos> Lucifer, she told me who she really is, and how you two are related.<eos> I somehow doubt that.<eos> No, it all makes sense.<eos> Why you were so disgusted when I suggested you two had slept together.<eos> Why you act so weird around her in general.<eos> She... really told you.

Why didn't you just tell me she was your step-mom?<eos> Well, it didn't seem that simple to explain.<eos> I mean, how did this all come about, anyway?<eos> Well...<eos> I caught Charlotte trying to steal evidence for Bianca Ruiz.<eos> What?<eos> Why would she do that?<eos> Well, apparently Bianca figured out that Charlotte and I were working together at the sting.<eos> Bianca threatened Charlotte's family.<eos> I mean, she threatened you if she didn't help.
This isn't what we agreed to.<eos> How do I know you'll hold up your end of the deal?<eos> Because I always do.<eos> And quite honestly, I don't see why you put so much value in...<eos> Freeze!<eos> See your hands!<eos> LAPD.<eos> Bianca Ruiz, you're under arrest.<eos> This is absurd.<eos> Charlotte. Will no longer be representing you.
Step away.<eos> I need to search her.<eos> Well, I don't think that's necessary, Detective.<eos> - Well, I do.<eos> - It's okay, son.<eos> Fine.<eos> Arms out.<eos> Oh, you're being incredibly thorough.<eos> I like it.<eos> - She's clean. - Well, I told you, Detective, she's got nothing to hide.
I'm wounded.<eos> Then go to a hospital.<eos> This isn't exactly a human injury, and since you know who, or rather what I am,<eos> I would appreciate it if you would just patch me up.<eos> Why does everybody keep doing this to me?<eos> I am a doctor, but patching people up isn't my thing.<eos> It is now.<eos> Suppose I could take a gander.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> I should warn you, you might have to...

Well...<eos> Ugh, no.<eos> Eagle Rock.<eos> Do not tell me you went to see Fred again.<eos> I thought you were done with that jerk.<eos> I was, till I ran into him at Jamba Juice.<eos> Understand completely.<eos> I mean, what's more intoxicating than a Mango-A-Go-Go?<eos> Alibi sorted.<eos> We'll leave you here with Soupy, and we'll be on our way.

Mum's powers are returning, and it won't be long before we can't contain them.<eos> I mean, she's already killed one person, and now the detective is on a... the detective is on her case.<eos> So, please, no discussion.<eos> Mum has to go!<eos> She already has.<eos> Your mother's gone.<eos> What?<eos> It's Cheval something or other.<eos> It's valuable, so it must be good.<eos> I wasn't expecting to see you or your... deadly light back so soon.
When you first saw my wound... you asked if Lucifer had done it.<eos> What did you mean by that?<eos> I meant nothing by it.<eos> You know?<eos> Meaningless brain fart, you know?<eos> Just blah. Came out.<eos> There was a lot going on that day.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I think, in fact, that you know something.<eos> I don't want to hurt you, Linda.
I'm thinking whoever killed Chet hired the Lyon sisters to clean up, then cleaned up the cleaner.<eos> Excuse me, what is going on?<eos> I work here.<eos> What did I do?<eos> It's me, only me.<eos> Ava knew nothing about it.<eos> I wasn't lying about Brad.<eos> I did get back together with him, but he gambles a lot, and he needed money.<eos> Then I got this call offering me a hundred grand.<eos> Who hired you?
Linda.<eos> I'll go check on Linda.<eos> You go after Mom, she'll listen to you.<eos> But, Luci, don't you dare promise her that piece, because I won't give it to her.<eos> Well, well. Someone's clever.<eos> How did you get me?<eos> Wasn't that hard.<eos> We tracked your phone.<eos> No, I mean, how did you figure out I was the bad guy?<eos> Did Little Miss Dandy Lyon tell you?
And you're going to be fine.<eos> I promise.<eos> I'm-I'm gonna fix you.<eos> Help me.<eos> Hello, Daniel.<eos> She kissed me.<eos> Literally no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Just get your hands up.<eos> No, don't be silly.<eos> I'm not gonna stab you.
You know, things between families can get pretty heated.<eos> Yes.<eos> Heated.<eos> Oh, and Ella found a Mondo blowtorch in Hector's car,<eos> - so there's that.<eos> - Right.<eos> The only thing I still don't understand is you seemed to have some inkling of this from the very beginning, so... why didn't you let me in on it?<eos> Well, you...<eos> 'Cause at this point, you either trust me or you don't.<eos> Detective, I trust you...
I'm okay.<eos> This is my fault.<eos> I-I should never have got you involved in any of this from the start.<eos> It's not like I didn't know I was dealing with the most powerful, well... the most dysfunctional family in the universe.<eos> Lucifer.<eos> I walked into this with my eyes wide open, chose to be your friend and face all that comes with that.<eos> The good, the bad and the crispy.<eos> What?<eos> I just realized something that I need to do.<eos> But... let's focus on you, shall we?
I hate to leave you here with all this. No.
I could drink it in the kitchen!<eos> So I'll draw up the paperwork.<eos> Month to month, right, Mr. Homan?<eos> Thank you, Pamela.<eos> I don't want to know how you did it or what it says about the fate of our country that you were able to, but I wanna thank you for getting the President of the United States to pardon me.<eos> As my grandmother used to say, it's good to have friends in low places.<eos> When Dembe said you had a case, I thought, how quaint.<eos> It's not.<eos> You looked at the photos I sent. Yes.<eos> Judge Culpepper was above reproach, which means many people would like her dead, but none I could connect to you in any way.
If that's PM, we're in trouble.<eos> Alert the MPD.<eos> Tell them we have actionable intel that a homicide is about to be attempted.<eos> Right, I'll mobilize surveillance.<eos> We're gonna take this guy down.<eos> He's not getting anywhere near your place this time.<eos> Geoffroy!<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> I was surprised you called me, Mr. Reddington.<eos> What can I do for you?
Why are you telling me this?<eos> I'm interested in the mines, but not in doing business with Iniko.<eos> You're asking me to betray my boss.<eos> Yes, I'm prepared to make a substantial contribution to the venture.<eos> He would kill me if he found out.<eos> If he were still alive.<eos> Look, Mr. Reddington, I don't know what you're suggesting--<eos> I'm suggesting that this is your moment if you're smart enough to seize it.<eos> Iniko's loyal only to himself.<eos> He suffers you because your uncle has the ear of the President.
So lecture then.<eos> You've been betrayed by a trusted employee.<eos> I recently experienced a similar betrayal.<eos> So I know that it's a bitter pill, especially since in our line of work, betrayal requires swift and decisive retribution.<eos> And you will give me the name in exchange for a cut of the mines.<eos> 25%.<eos> Assuming you can verify what I tell you is true.<eos> 20.<eos> Geoffroy Keino.<eos> He approached me about investing in the mines if I agreed to kill you.
You poisoned her and then tried to murder Marlon Milch.<eos> Marlon Milch?<eos> Is that his name?<eos> Come on.<eos> You're trying to say that you don't know the name<eos> - of the man that you tried to kill?<eos> - You've got it all wrong.<eos> I wasn't trying to kill these people.<eos> I was trying to save them.<eos> I left the models for you because I wasn't sure what else to do.
They're premonitions.<eos> All right, tell us about the victims.<eos> A respected judge, a controversial businessman.<eos> Why target them?<eos> Why are they connected?<eos> I only know what I see in the dioramas.<eos> Why haven't you taken these premonitions to the police?<eos> I have.<eos> They looked at me like I'm crazy.<eos> That's why I came to you, Agent Keen.
The mining deal is closed.<eos> You sound surprised.<eos> And you look scared.<eos> Iniko completed financing without consulting me.<eos> And now he's not returning my calls.<eos> Perhaps he has a new acolyte.<eos> Or grew wary of your ambition.<eos> I've given him no reason to be.<eos> Others might have.<eos> People hoping to gain his trust by betraying you.
When I was in college, Matt Skrdell had a Ouija board, and we actually made contact with my pet rabbit, Dash,<eos> God rest her soul, and it turns out she did not escape from her cage like I was told.<eos> That should solve it.<eos> Hey, it's me.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> ...has to happen sooner in the tower as discussed.<eos> Aram, where are they?<eos> We couldn't finish Milch, and you're talking about the next job?<eos> What have you found out?<eos> I said I'd get back to you when I know more.
We couldn't finish Milch, and you're talking about the next job?<eos> What have you found out?<eos> I said I'd get back to you when I know more.<eos> Stick to the plan.<eos> Did we lose them?<eos> For now.<eos> But they're out there, very close.<eos> The next time they call, we're gonna find them.<eos> I don't know whether to be relieved or terrified.<eos> Thanks to you, I know how it's happening, but it's only happening because these people, these killers live nearby.
It was as if his security detail knew where to look.<eos> - And you think I told him?<eos> - No one else knew.<eos> Except the munitions expert who made the bomb, the mechanic who installed it.<eos> You were sloppy, and you're looking for someone to blame.<eos> Blame yourself.<eos> If I go home, I'm a dead man.<eos> Then don't go home.<eos> Iniko may not be taking your calls, but he will certainly take mine.<eos> I told you, the deal on the mine is closed.
Calm down.<eos> Stick to the plan.<eos> Calm down?<eos> They have my files, every trade.<eos> I'm going to jail.<eos> Ben, you and I have forecasted how many transactions?<eos> We knew this day would eventually come, that it would eventually end.<eos> - Now the plan is--<eos> - They have the girl.<eos> Yes, and they know about you.
I just hung up with him.<eos> He placed the short against Jasek through the shell 20 minutes ago.<eos> We've got to see this through.<eos> Why don't we just put a bullet in Beckner's head?<eos> Because a bullet brings unwanted attention, ends up with FinCEN looking through each and every one of Beckner's transactions, which could point to us.<eos> No.<eos> It has to look like an accident.<eos> He's the only one who knows where our funds are routed.<eos> If he's dead, we're ghosts-- rich ghosts.<eos> Finish him, and I'll see you at the plane.
It should.<eos> You cleaned it two months ago.<eos> Friend of mine, shot six times, 5 liters of his blood on this carpet.<eos> After you were done, not a drop.<eos> You're Raymond Reddington.<eos> Yes.<eos> And this is my associate Dembe Zuma.<eos> Well, aren't you a tall drink of chocolate milk?<eos> I'd like you to work for me.<eos> Whatever Iniko was paying you, I'll double it.
That's before pneumatic fail-safes.<eos> They're gonna crash the elevator.<eos> - I've got him.<eos> - Security.<eos> This is Bobby.<eos> This is FBI Assistant Director Cooper.<eos> We have credible intel that one of your employees in the building may be in danger.<eos> I need you to shut down everything.<eos> Nobody in or out.<eos> Metro PD and FBI agents are on our way to you now.
I'm sorry.<eos> Antioxidants, Omega-3, Spirulina and alkaline, all in one bottle?<eos> I have no clue what any of those things are, yet I'm convinced I can't live without them.<eos> So, as they say, about last night?<eos> Get over it.<eos> It wasn't that bad.<eos> It was that bad with a dollop of shit on top.<eos> Not sure what was cringier, you and Izzy publicly vacuuming each other's mouths or Jack awkwardly watching it.<eos> It's not like he's never seen us kiss before.<eos> Well, the untrained eye might mistake you two for a couple of full-blooded lesbians, not bisexuals.
Hello?<eos> Ruby.<eos> No. I'm actually just a few blocks away.<eos> Why?<eos> Sure.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> [Beeps] I got to run.<eos> You're making this really rough on me, Uncle Jack.<eos> - What're you talking about? - What am I talking about?<eos> I'm talking about you.
- Mm, yep. We're gonna fuck it out.<eos> I think the term is "hug it out," right, Jack?<eos> You guys are more than welcome to keep talking, but I'm gonna go back up to the bedroom, and I'll leave this dress here.<eos> But I can keep the heels on.<eos> So 26.<eos> - "Fuck it out."<eos> - You think that's gonna work?<eos> Okay, so I'm good.<eos> Hmm. Me, too.<eos> Told you.
- Attention. I've been asked to read this statement.<eos> "Two months ago, Gina Linetti was hit by a bus,<eos> "and the brightest star in the cosmos was extinguished.<eos> "But today, like a phoenix from the ashes, she rises to vanquish"...<eos> This is ten pages.<eos> I can't read it.<eos> Gina's doctor said it was okay for her to come back to work today.<eos> Here she is.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> As much pain as I've been in, I can't imagine what it's been like for you... Living in a Gina-less world for two months.
- Amy, didn't you tell him to his face he was the most boring man alive?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - This is gonna be awkward.<eos> - Yep.<eos> - We had a good run.<eos> - Let's not panic just yet.<eos> Maybe he doesn't remember us ruining his life and stomping all over his heart.<eos> Hey, everyone.<eos> I'm Sergeant Wells.<eos> Jake, Amy, nice to see you.
- We had a good run.<eos> - Let's not panic just yet.<eos> Maybe he doesn't remember us ruining his life and stomping all over his heart.<eos> Hey, everyone.<eos> I'm Sergeant Wells.<eos> Jake, Amy, nice to see you.<eos> - Teddy, nice to see you, too.<eos> Excited to have you in the field with us.<eos> - Good.<eos> I just hope I don't bore you to death.
Hello, weekend plans.<eos> - Sergeant Wells, have you been to other precincts yet?<eos> How'd they do?<eos> - Well, you know, everyone's got their issues.<eos> - That's too bad.<eos> I want all my brothers in the NYPD to do perfectly.<eos> The Seven-Four is corrupt.<eos> You didn't hear it from me.<eos> - You know what? We're just looking to eliminate waste.<eos> - I assure you, you'll find zero waste here.
When we were going together, I was boring.<eos> It took our breakup for me to realize that.<eos> - So you're not still mad at me?<eos> - No, no, no, you changed me.<eos> - I found my wild side.<eos> My girlfriend and I do 5Ks now.<eos> We took a two-week trip to San Diego last year.<eos> The energy of that place is electric.<eos> - But back at the precinct, you said,<eos> "I hope I don't bore you to death."
It's the Wild West.<eos> - Oh, man, Teddy, look what happened.<eos> Your phone landed directly in this glass of OJ.<eos> - That seems almost impossible.<eos> - "Almost" being the key word, but it happened for real, and we all know it.<eos> There you go.<eos> - That's it. - You've gone too far.<eos> I am storming off now.<eos> - No, you've gone too far, and I'm storming off now!<eos> - There's something I'd like to show you, Captain.

- Uh-oh.<eos> - Okay. Okay, everybody just calm down and take a deep breath.<eos> What the hell is going on, man?<eos> - Yeah, what the hell is going on?<eos> - You've got a girlfriend.<eos> - I know. - And she's fine.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Sorry. - I was really planning on you being in the cab during this.<eos> - Okay, that wouldn't make it better.<eos> - No. - Amy, I'm just... I'm not over you yet, and I would've never said anything, because I thought you and Jake were happy, but after seeing you at jazz brunch,
Riggs has followed this case.<eos> He's studied the procedure.<eos> They know him.<eos> They trust him.<eos> Okay, Owen, I'm not...<eos> I'm sorry, but Riggs is the better choice here.<eos> Well, then why isn't he the one who's doing our surgery?<eos> Listen, Leo...<eos> Owen, tell me.<eos> So, Dr. Hunt told you what?
So, Dr. Hunt told you what?<eos> I was talking to Dr. Robbins, and I raised a concern.<eos> We are going to stick with the original plan... have Dr. Riggs do the surgery.<eos> I'm sure that you're a great doctor, but this is just too big of a deal.<eos> I agree.<eos> It is a very big deal.<eos> I know that Dr. Hunt is your friend...<eos> - Owen is like family.<eos> - Even better.<eos> So as your family, Dr. Hunt is looking out for you.
Owen, is... is that what it is?<eos> I'm just... concerned.<eos> Well, so am I.<eos> This is scary as hell, which is why I don't need a doctor that has a happy and perfect home life.<eos> I just need her to be the best.<eos> That's me.<eos> That's why I am the chief of my department.<eos> And, frankly, my part of the surgery is a walk in the park.<eos> Your baby's mass is easily extractable.<eos> The truly risky part of this surgery is when Dr. Robbins has to open you up to get to your baby.
I mean, are you sure we're not exposing ourselves?<eos> Well, I've already been exposed. I have the antibodies.<eos> Also, I'm not a gutless wuss.<eos> So, pick up some Metz.<eos> I don't have the antibodies.<eos> Do you?<eos> - TB can kill you.<eos> - Cross may have killed us?<eos> You're not gonna die from someone else's abdominal tuberculosis.<eos> I mean, there's a remote possibility, but it's not gonna kill you right now.
What I don't like is how they treat you... the comments and the backhanded compliments.<eos> I'm gonna stop you before you say something you shouldn't.<eos> This my family we're talking about.<eos> No!<eos> In surgery, we call it<eos> - "a complication."<eos> - No.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - We've hit a snag a bump in the road... turbulence.<eos> Sir, I can gate check that for you.
No!<eos> In surgery, we call it<eos> - "a complication."<eos> - No.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - We've hit a snag a bump in the road... turbulence.<eos> Sir, I can gate check that for you.<eos> - It'll fit.<eos> - No, sir, it won't.<eos> I'm telling you, it's gonna fit.
- No.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - We've hit a snag a bump in the road... turbulence.<eos> Sir, I can gate check that for you.<eos> - It'll fit.<eos> - No, sir, it won't.<eos> I'm telling you, it's gonna fit.<eos> - I got it up here fine last flight.<eos> - I'll rephrase<eos> I'm going to gate check your bag for you now, sir.
I never travel without children.<eos> I was so looking forward to being on this flight alone.<eos> This is my "me" time.<eos> Please don't ruin it.<eos> I'm just saying, sometimes the universe gives you signs, and this could be one of those signs.<eos> I know you're not asleep.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Oh, sorry.<eos> No, Ingrid, you're fine.<eos> I wasn't talking to you.

Just help me up.<eos> I'll get the kit myself.<eos> It's only my wrist.<eos> It's not the end of the world, okay?<eos> - Just help me up. - Okay.<eos> - Ah. - Here you go.<eos> Okay, Max, I'm gonna need you to follow my finger, okay?<eos> On behalf of the captain, we ask everyone to please remain calm and seated.<eos> If you need immediate medical assistance, please press your call buttons.<eos> Max, I need to examine you some more.
Sure thing.<eos> Uh, can I help?<eos> - I'm a doctor, too.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> You can, um, go around and see if there's any other passengers that need immediate assistance.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You want to hold that for me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Got a bunch of Band-Aids and a defibrillator and no splint, so I can shock you, but I can't splint your wrist.
Because we are currently flying between two very dangerous storm systems,<eos> - one above and one below.<eos> - I really need to speak to her.<eos> There's no way to descend without putting the lives of every single person on this plane at risk.<eos> Call her.<eos> Hi, Captain.<eos> Hi, yeah, it's Candace.<eos> - Yes, I have Dr...<eos> - Dr. Grey.<eos> ...Dr. Grey here, she's asking to speak to you about landing the plane.
...Dr. Grey here, she's asking to speak to you about landing the plane.<eos> Yes, I understand.<eos> Of course.<eos> Thank you, Captain.<eos> No, no, I need to speak to her.<eos> Okay, she's busy navigating the plane through dangerous weather.<eos> - She can't talk right now.<eos> - What about the landing?<eos> She won't be doing that either, Dr. Grey, not until it's safe.<eos> Can I help you with anything else?
But you don't.<eos> You never do.<eos> A week ago, you called it quits.<eos> An hour ago, we're having sex in the bathroom.<eos> Will you stop it, please?<eos> I will respect whatever you decide, okay?<eos> But don't sit here and pretend that you don't want this thing between you and me as much as I do.<eos> I am married.<eos> Uh, hey. Uh, sorry.<eos> Uh... we need you.
Maintenance tool kits aren't allowed on board unless they're checked underneath.<eos> And there's no way to get down below?<eos> Definitely not.<eos> What's going on?<eos> A drill.<eos> I need something I can use as a drill.<eos> Meredith, can we just pause for a minute?<eos> Hey, should we move Max or...<eos> Hey, you're a dentist.<eos> Do you have any drills on you?
Good news... I've confirmed a safe location for us to make an emergency landing.<eos> Please be seated as we begin our descent.<eos> Now she's gonna land the freakin' plane.<eos> It will be a bumpy ride, so make sure your seat belts are fastened.<eos> It's still in there?<eos> Did it move?<eos> Looks okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Flight attendants, please prepare for landing.<eos> I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't tell you all to be seated right now.
Nice and easy.<eos> You ready?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Remember, he seized from an epidural hematoma.<eos> I wrote it all down and taped it to his chest, okay?<eos> Thank you for keeping him alive.<eos> Of course.<eos> Doctor.<eos> Captain.<eos> Nice flying with you.

- Dr. Bailey?<eos> - See?<eos> You made me late.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Hello. Good morning, all.<eos> Uh, I am Dr. Miranda Bailey, Chief of Surgery, and I would like to extend a very warm welcome to the members of the press here today.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> I just talked to your oncologist.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> I told him not to page you away from some sick kid.
Did you life flash before your eyes?<eos> How did it feel to receive a commendation by the governor?<eos> Is it true you got a call from the president?<eos> Did you kiss the ground when you landed?<eos> - Did you think you were gonna die?<eos> - Okay, slow down.<eos> I was...<eos> We were on our way to a medical conference.<eos> Pretty routine stuff, really.<eos> Certainly didn't expect to be sitting here in front of all of you.
You're admitting that?<eos> Well, I would like to explain.<eos> No.<eos> I don't need details.<eos> I would like to explain.<eos> Mer, I have surgery.<eos> I got to go.<eos> You should feel a cold sensation right now.<eos> It might burn a little, but only for a moment.<eos> This is gonna numb you for the surgery.
Sorry.<eos> He likes worms.<eos> He likes anything that's out of the norm, so the worms will be good for him.<eos> They might uplift his mood, which has been a little down lately.<eos> - Wouldn't you agree?<eos> - Dr. Bailey, I have surgery.<eos> If you need to say something, say it quicker!<eos> Uh, I know that Dr. Webber's spending the night in the on-call room when you're here in town.<eos> That is his choice.<eos> And I know that things between you two have been less than favorable since Dr. Minnick arrived, which is a decision that I made.

No outlet protectors.<eos> We haven't gotten those yet.<eos> All over the house... electric, floor-level death traps.<eos> He won't be crawling for months.<eos> Also don't have a stroller.<eos> I was gonna pick one up next weekend.<eos> Order it now.<eos> It'll be waiting when we get home.<eos> The O.R.'s almost ready, Veronica.<eos> We can take you up soon.
She's in good hands.<eos> She'll be just fine.<eos> I'll take good care of her.<eos> Jer, you stay with him.<eos> You promised.<eos> I'm counting on you.<eos> But I don't...<eos> Go on.<eos> Stay with him.<eos> I'll see you in a little bit.
There's no guarantee you'd survive it.<eos> And what if we didn't do anything?<eos> Veronica, we need to do this procedure.<eos> If we don't, you might not make it off this table today.<eos> Okay, pressure's dropping.<eos> Get a cart ready!<eos> No.<eos> I signed that DNR for a reason.<eos> You can rescind.<eos> Let us help you.
How is she?<eos> Say something.<eos> Did you get the clot?<eos> Now, you see these clusters?<eos> Those were secondary boluses starting to form.<eos> We removed hundreds of them.<eos> They were breeding like crazy.<eos> Like babies.<eos> I wanted babies with Dennis, but now I'm a worm farm.<eos> Um, we'll monitor you, but I think that you'll be up and at 'em again in a few days.
Mary?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I was being weird.<eos> I was repulsive.<eos> No.<eos> Love-bug.<eos> You were sick.<eos> That's all.<eos> I am concerned about you and Dr. Webber, so I need to say what I need to say.
Noted.<eos> You can go now.<eos> I got divorced, raised a boy on my own.<eos> I found a new man, became that new man's boss.<eos> Sound familiar?<eos> See, I know it can feel impossible at times, but I figured it out.<eos> I know what I'm doing, which is how I know that you do not.<eos> You do not know how to be married.<eos> N...<eos> Not to a real man, to someone who's your equal, your champion, who loves you and respects you, and is mad as hell at you, because I do.
Not if it's God's will.<eos> So, thank you for respecting our beliefs.<eos> How soon can you discharge my son?<eos> And this states you are aware you're taking Liam home against medical advice.<eos> I know this probably seems a little... unusual.<eos> I appreciate your understanding.<eos> Do you understand that "against medical advice"<eos> in this case means if you take Liam now, there's a very real chance Liam will die?<eos> Thank you, Dr. Edwards.<eos> Who taught you it was okay to speak to patients that way?

- I have a giant, scary tumor.<eos> - What?<eos> I stayed up all night studying it, and I think I solved it.<eos> Now you're telling me I could have solved it from the comfort of my own home, my own bedroom, my own bed...<eos> I want a giant, scary tumor.<eos> Get your own.<eos> I got to go see my patient.<eos> All night?<eos> - I know. - Ugh.<eos> Holly, I know other doctors have failed you, but they were not thinking outside the box.
Holly, I know other doctors have failed you, but they were not thinking outside the box.<eos> Now, I have studied your heart, I've studied your tumor, and I can get this.<eos> I know I can.<eos> - Nope.<eos> - Look.<eos> You know there's only six doctors in the world that can do this surgery, and I am one of them?<eos> Look, we have a shot...<eos> No.<eos> No, you guys...<eos> look, I told you.
- Nope.<eos> - Look.<eos> You know there's only six doctors in the world that can do this surgery, and I am one of them?<eos> Look, we have a shot...<eos> No.<eos> No, you guys...<eos> look, I told you.<eos> Ah. No revisiting.<eos> No hatching new plans.<eos> I told you, just fix up my spleen, and then send me on my way, that's it.
No, but that's the thing...<eos> I'm not.<eos> When I was first diagnosed, sure.<eos> But then I thought, what would make me feel better?<eos> Find a hot guy, have a ridiculous night, and then all would be well.<eos> So I did that, and I kept doing that until I realized... why do anything else?<eos> Sex and death.<eos> That's want I want.<eos> Well, you can say you're ready for death... a lot of people do... but as someone who's been around a lot of death and been left behind by it,<eos> I can tell you... trust me... you don't want that.
That's want I want.<eos> Well, you can say you're ready for death... a lot of people do... but as someone who's been around a lot of death and been left behind by it,<eos> I can tell you... trust me... you don't want that.<eos> Especially when you have someone like Dr. Pierce telling you she can fix you, offering you the impossible.<eos> Don't ignore that.<eos> The scary thing isn't dying.<eos> The scary thing is surviving and accepting that you actually have a life to live.<eos> Don't you want to stick around and live it?<eos> You really think you can get the tumor?<eos> I told you I could get it.

Yeah, but other doctors have meant it.<eos> I'll put you on bypass.<eos> And I'll remove your heart so I can get all the tumor.<eos> Dr. Grey, Dr. Kepner will be there to assist.<eos> Holly...<eos> I can get the tumor out.<eos> Go for it.<eos> You sure?<eos> Yeah, do it.<eos> Dr. Shepherd, I've got Social Work paging you.
He showed up again and became emergent.<eos> Did what we needed to do to save his life.<eos> - Karev!<eos> - Is there something I should know?<eos> You opened this child's skull without his parents knowing, after what happened last time?<eos> He seized in the E.R.<eos> Dr. Shepherd, it's Social Work again, 911.<eos> The patient's parents are here.<eos> - What happened last time? - Nothing happened.<eos> One of you better start talking... right now.
Well, hold on now...<eos> Well, did she injure the man?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Does it matter?<eos> I-I just can't believe this.<eos> From Edwards?<eos> You can't?<eos> You yourself said her boyfriend died... a former patient of hers.<eos> No counseling, no support, no time off.<eos> I told you, we watched her.

We're expecting him to make a full recovery.<eos> Liam made it all the way to the hospital on his own.<eos> Blind.<eos> It was a miracle.<eos> Or... someone helped him.<eos> Someone drove him here.<eos> The Lord helps those who help themselves.<eos> So, um... my tumor's still in there.<eos> I'm so sorry, Holly.<eos> Oh, God, what did I tell you guys?
I won't be there, so...<eos> W-What do you mean?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> My privileges got revoked.<eos> I have to go to counseling.<eos> For real?<eos> For how long?<eos> Have fun raising your game.<eos> You'll actually have a shot at beating mine now.<eos> Hey. I-I'm glad I caught you in the office.
They are cleared!<eos> - There's a rapist on the loose?<eos> - Where have you been?<eos> We have a multiple-alarm fire on floors five and six, from the service elevators east.<eos> And we are concerned about structural damage on that floor.<eos> We're diverting all incoming traumas.<eos> Patients in immediate or impending danger need to be evacuated first.<eos> Unaffected areas... the E.R., radiology, nursery, daycare... they stay put.<eos> We have to prioritize.<eos> Firefighter Carroll here will be directing you to the most urgent areas.
- Stephanie?<eos> - Yeah. Erin, uh, hang on!<eos> Hang on!<eos> I don't like this.<eos> Don't worry, uh, uh, Sondra.<eos> You'll be fine, all right?<eos> Um, you're just gonna get a bit of fresh air, all right?<eos> Okay, we got Mr. Pruitt downstairs safe and sound.<eos> Who's next?<eos> Okay, these two very capable doctors are gonna carry you down.
Here. Come here.<eos> Put your arms around me, tight as you can, okay?<eos> Got to go up.<eos> Got to go up.<eos> - One at a time. - Uh-huh.<eos> One step at a time.<eos> One step.<eos> One at a time.<eos> There we go.<eos> Ma'am, can I help you?
Let me help you walk.<eos> I don't need any help!<eos> Ma'am, did you just have surgery?<eos> For God's sake, I'm not a "ma'am."<eos> My name is Cheryl, and surgery would be better than this.<eos> Being sliced open and gutted would be better than this.<eos> It's just kidney stones!<eos> Okay. Look, no, we gotta get you out of this hallway.<eos> There's way too much smoke, all right?<eos> I'm gonna pick you up.
Just a regular hallway.<eos> - Where's radiology on this thing?<eos> - All right.<eos> When... When I saw her, we were close to there.<eos> I had no idea who she was with.<eos> If I'd realized, I could've done something.<eos> Which way were they walking?<eos> It's just...<eos> You know what?<eos> It's easier if I show you.

She's alive.<eos> That's not funny.<eos> The Army called Owen this morning.<eos> That's not funny.<eos> Major Hunt.<eos> I'm Lieutenant Hill.<eos> This is Colonel Turner.<eos> Glad you guys could make it on such short notice.<eos> If there's anything you need, don't hesitate to ask.<eos> - We're here for you.
- I'm sorry.<eos> If anyone could follow protocol around here,<eos> Edwards would be perfectly fine right now.<eos> I'm sorry. What?<eos> She was supposed to be in counseling.<eos> But Dr. Webber over here decided she should be able to work today.<eos> If you hadn't completely undermined me...<eos> - If I hadn't compl...<eos> - Then a little girl would be dead!<eos> I don't believe that there's a place for you in my hospital any longer.
But you can't do all types of drugs.<eos> No. All drugs aren't created equal.<eos> That's right.<eos> - Abraham Lincoln said that.<eos> - That's right, man.<eos> But all drugs aren't created equal.<eos> We did shrooms a year ago for the very first time.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And here's a rule of thumb:<eos> You should never do shrooms with a dude who looks like you.
CPA.<eos> - How does it make you feel?<eos> - [Kenny] I feel terrible.<eos> - You feel lumpy inside, don't you?<eos> - [Kenny] I do.<eos> I want to go back home.<eos> [Keith] We can't take this anymore.<eos> Can you take us back home, dude?<eos> All right. All right.<eos> I'll take you back.
- Dope.<eos> - Psych!<eos> You gullible-ass niggers.<eos> I started it because I hate niggers, Jews and fairies!<eos> - You almost had us there for a second. - He almost had us there for a second.<eos> - All right. Bye-bye, Nixon.<eos> - Bye, man. Peace, Nixon.<eos> Thanks for the War on Drugs.<eos> Thanks for the tour.<eos> All right. I love you.
A bit of that anti-magic potion stuck to you in the blast.<eos> And, well, as you can see, I needed some.<eos> So, thanks.<eos> I just left you at the town line.<eos> You left Regina at the town line.<eos> You are Regina.<eos> I'm the Evil Queen.<eos> You, of all people, should recognize a Doppelganger when you see one.<eos> There's two of us now.<eos> I don't care if there's seven of you now.
♪ ♪<eos> You guys psyched for Death Castle?<eos> Oh, yeah, baby.<eos> I hear there's a crazy twist at the end.<eos> What the fuck did you tell me that for?<eos> Yeah, what the hell, Arnold?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I didn't tell you what the twist was.
Would you do me a favor and give me a ring if the missus shows up?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Appreciate it very much.<eos> Mr. Wiest.<eos> Miss Jenkins.<eos> Mr. Delfino.<eos> Mr. Marco.<eos> Florence, what's up?<eos> Eddie, I have a favor to ask of you.

Yes, indeed!<eos> Huzzah!<eos> Very well said and said very well!<eos> Crane, we are not even a minute in.<eos> Not that your enthusiasm isn't appreciated by the cutest of colonial militia.<eos> Let us march to stay warm and keep up morale.<eos> One...<eos> Not historically accurate enough for you?
Now, you, miss Molly, are a natural-born actor.<eos> But your dancing, though enthusiastic, lacking a little precision...<eos> Okay, you made us so proud up here.<eos> Did you ask her yet?<eos> Yeah, well, mom,<eos> Kendra is having a sleepover for all of the girls in the cast, and if you'd rather I go home with you, I'd really like to...<eos> No, no, it's not a school night.<eos> Go crazy.<eos> I'm so proud.<eos> Things seem very well between you two.
Theater.<eos> You sure you weren't an actor?<eos> Well, not unless you include John of gaunt in the bath.<eos> This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle, this earth of majesty, this seat of Mars, this...<eos> Agent Thomas? Seems our search for dreyfuss is nearing a conclusion.<eos> Something amiss?<eos> You ever get that feeling like... Someone just walked over your grave?<eos> In my case, that may have actually happened.<eos> Twice.<eos> It's nice to see you back in touch with your sartorial senses.
Any progress on a way to heal the horseman of death?<eos> I'm working on it, Malcolm.<eos> Good, good, good. And the last horseman?<eos> I'm attending to the acquisition of the rider of war's totem personally.<eos> The turricula ignis will be in your possession soon.<eos> I must confess, jobe, I am feeling... Celebratory.<eos> How about a quick constitutional and a fine, upstanding cut of beef?<eos> There's a place within striking distance said to have the best aged porterhouse in three states.<eos> Bury the lede, why don't you, jobe?<eos> Anything for you, Malcolm.
"used to summon the rider of war is named turricula ignis."<eos> Weapon of fire.<eos> Indeed. Here. "The arma mutata believed it to be hidden" somewhere in America during the revolutionary war."<eos> That's the proximity alarm.<eos> Right there.<eos> She's stolen a Tome.<eos> I'm going after her.<eos> No sign of our thief in the east tunnels.<eos> Understood.<eos> I shall meet you at the next juncture.
Does our good fortune continue to hold, Mr. crane?<eos> For now.<eos> No sign of patrols.<eos> Are you certain the parcel is secure?<eos> It is safe, below the farmstead in a cache of my own design.<eos> Very good.<eos> Whatever it is must be valuable indeed for you to deliver it personally.<eos> Curious, are we?<eos> As only a man who's risked his skin for days can be.<eos> All I can tell you is that which we have now safeguarded could be used to spark a conflict beyond all others.
No one even knows we're here.<eos> Not the dhs, the demon.<eos> And his master.<eos> Dreyfuss won't rest until he's got his hands on the gun.<eos> Until he's used it.<eos> What happens when he does?<eos> You know.<eos> You have to know.<eos> That gun, when you fire it, it raises the horseman of war.<eos> I am doing this to help you.
A couple of babes in the woods.<eos> Ooh, ooh, not unlike one of those, grimm fairy tales, right, jobe?<eos> Those don't end well, Malcolm.<eos> There's usually someone that ends up getting burned or eaten or chopped up into tiny morsels and scattered to the winds, right?<eos> If you're trying to scare us, the rest of our team will be here any minute.<eos> It is Jake Wells, right?<eos> Alex. Ms. norwood.<eos> The only two employees of the vault, if memory serves.<eos> Yeah, now, the other members of your so-called team, crane, Thomas and mills, yeah...<eos> Torrent downloaded from RARBG. I'm so, so sorry to break it to you, but I'm afraid they're out of their league.
That was, clever, to a degree, I guess, right?<eos> I'm an Internet billionaire.<eos> So think big brother.<eos> Think eye in the sky.<eos> You don't hack me.<eos> I hack...<eos> Still, I-i... I don't quite know everything.<eos> I still don't quite know precisely where ichabod crane has taken my gun.<eos> Would you care to tell me where he has taken my...<eos> Okay, we've trusted you.
What do you know about this gun and how do we destroy it?<eos> In order to dispose of a charged totem with the turricula ignis' level of power, we need to take it to a nexus of primal energy.<eos> I recall a mention of a primal nexus in the compendium of masonic history.<eos> 'Tis a location rich in powerful ley lines.<eos> Everything comes back to ley lines and blood moons.<eos> Or glamour, if you're dealing with witches.<eos> No, you're right. Only a nexus point where the ley lines cross is a safe place to destroy it.<eos> And there's one here, so...<eos> We don't know where crane is.<eos> And if we did, we wouldn't tell you.
You checked the histories, but, um... how about the shelf they sit on?<eos> These look more than decorative.<eos> "Sa." One of the symbols that let us onto J Street.<eos> It's a switch.<eos> It's a hidden volume.<eos> It's dated 1789.<eos> The first entry relates a meeting between Banneker and Washington in Sleepy Hollow at a site of a recently decommissioned armory.<eos> - Sleepy Hollow? That's your archive.<eos> - Uh-huh. It says here it was redesigned and improved by Banneker.<eos> Is that Betsy Ross, Samuel I told you before... no one can know that she was on that mission.

Before he became immortal.<eos> Now you'll never get that soul you bargained for.<eos> I have a contract with Malcolm Dreyfuss.<eos> Hell abides by rules.<eos> We need to find a way to kill an immortal man.<eos> Why would I help you kill Malcolm Dreyfuss?<eos> He's bringing down an apocalypse.<eos> I deal in souls in torment.<eos> That would be a... conflict of interest?<eos> That doesn't bother you that he cheated you?
So, if I can get close enough to Dreyfuss, I can use this to reverse the effects of his immortality long enough to deliver a mortal blow.<eos> On our end,<eos> Banneker hid a trove of magical weapons in here.<eos> Yeah, I don't know about magical, though.<eos> Yeah, time has<eos> - not been kind. - Honestly, I don't even know how we're gonna use these against the Horsemen.<eos> All right, stop it.<eos> When I first walked through these doors, this was Agency 355 by name only.<eos> But we have, every one of us, restored it to its former glory.<eos> So I ask you today, now... trust me.
I have a chance because of you.<eos> Just please be careful.<eos> You might be from the future, but you're still my baby girl.<eos> You watch your six, Mom.<eos> You, too, old man.<eos> Stay together.<eos> Hold the line.<eos> "E pluribus unum."<eos> Out of many, one.<eos> So it's down to you and me and a chunk of rock
Oh, my God.<eos> Is that the heartbeat?<eos> That's the heartbeat.<eos> There's a baby in there!<eos> He's just like my burrito.<eos> Except we made this together.<eos> Well, I will tell you one thing.<eos> You won't forget this birth.<eos> I know. First one's always the most exciting, right?<eos> No, I mean it's probably going to split you from tip to tail.
You won't forget this birth.<eos> I know. First one's always the most exciting, right?<eos> No, I mean it's probably going to split you from tip to tail.<eos> It's gonna be huge.<eos> So you can say goodbye to this bod.<eos> What have you done to me?<eos> All right, it's gonna be okay. Just keep breathing.<eos> I'm gonna go talk to the doctor about his bedside manner.<eos> Hey, Doc.<eos> Can I talk to you for a sec?

Are we safe now?<eos> Thank you for the gift of this bread... To sustain these vessels our bodies, so that we may have the energy to create a more beautiful world, and break through the blocks and barriers of this life, and ascend The Ladder of Enlightenment.<eos> He's almost three weeks old, and he still doesn't have a name.<eos> Did you want to call him Steve?<eos> Well, um, definitely not my dad's name.<eos> Well, the right name will come.<eos> Whose last name will he have?<eos> Are you and Daddy back together again?<eos> Daddy's just helping us.<eos> I like you back together.
Who is this magical friend?<eos> You know, you don't have to stay with us.<eos> We'll be fine.<eos> I know.<eos> Here.<eos> Because you're still the mother of my children.<eos> Meyerists view death as a celebration.<eos> A celebration of a life lived, and the promise of The Garden.<eos> But in this case, there's no joy, only anger and sorrow.<eos> Many of you suggested we not gather for Richard's passing, but hehe was with us for a long time, and loved.
Thanks so much for having us.<eos> I got a roast in the kitchen.<eos> Just needs a little more time.<eos> Um, I sorry, Iwe we don't really eat meat.<eos> I should have said something.<eos> You're vegetarians?<eos> Yes, but we'rewe're happy with anything else.<eos> Gosh, I feel terrible.<eos> You do the homeschool too.<eos> What does that make you?
Thank you.<eos> Cast came off. Yeah.<eos> You take it off yourself?<eos> I noticed it in the trash.<eos> It was itching, so...<eos> American?<eos> I hunt.<eos> Um, you look nervous.<eos> Um, guns around kids make me nervous.<eos> Now, I tried Googling you.

Eddie Lane is there?<eos> Just a second.<eos> What about Eddie Lane?<eos> He's here.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Hello, Hawk.<eos> It seems as if your life is about as complicated as my son's.<eos> What is this?<eos> It's just, business.<eos> Now, one of you tell me what's going on.
NASA'S seventh manned mission to the Moon.<eos> We need to figure out a way to get into Mission Control.<eos> I don't think that's included in the tour.<eos> Commander Heywood is not at Mission Control.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because I'm looking right at him.<eos> That's the Flight Director of NASA.<eos> They're probably debating on how to talk to the press about the oxygen tank explosion on "Apollo 13."<eos> Henry.<eos> Great to see you.
Sorry, folks.<eos> He doesn't have the right credentials.<eos> We take press access very seriously around here.<eos> Surprise!<eos> We're back.<eos> Why are you doing this, Henry?<eos> I was never supposed to see him again.<eos> So you punched him?<eos> That's between him and me.<eos> What brings you to 1970?

You could say that.<eos> Henry. Amaya.<eos> As I live and breathe.<eos> It's good to see you again, son.<eos> Come here, man.<eos> I thought I'd never see you again.<eos> Look at you, you still got it.<eos> Is that Rip?<eos> Get him out of there!<eos> As soon as one of you explains what in tarnation is going on.
No, no, the velocity of the Command Module would merely bring us closer to the meteorites.<eos> Which is why I'm swinging the ship around.<eos> I'm gonna try and stop the trajectory of the Command Module.<eos> Sara, you need to abort.<eos> We're going to hit the meteoroids.<eos> Better us than the Command Module.<eos> Can't you at least to try to destroy the meteoroids rather than using my ship as a human shield?<eos> It worked before back in 1942.<eos> You put the Waverider in front of a nuke and it absorbed the blast.<eos> At least I had the decency to time-scatter you all first.
It's April 13th, 1970, at 2200 hours, and I am stranded on the moon.<eos> Fuel on the LEM is close to zero.<eos> The food and water provisions were designed to last days, not months.<eos> So, yeah, I'm gonna have to science the crap out of this.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm filming us for posterity.<eos> In case we don't... make it back.<eos> I'm not dying on the moon.<eos> Sign... signing off.<eos> Certainly not doing it in a tin can with the likes of you.
And I'll play nice until we get back to Earth.<eos> I promise.<eos> Yeah. Not a chance.<eos> And for your information, I already have a plan.<eos> All I have to do is transfer the fuel source from my exo-suit and power the fuel cells.<eos> Use the dwarf star to power the LEM.<eos> Yeah, that should work.<eos> Of course you've taken the gas spectrometer into account.<eos> Well, unless you adjust for the relative volatility of dwarf star, then the LEM could explode mid-launch.<eos> I'm a scientist from the future and I'm here to tell you, this is a two-person patch job.
How do you know all this?<eos> Ray told me.<eos> He knows your granddaughter.<eos> I don't think I should be hearing this.<eos> Ask Ray what happens to your village.<eos> Ask him what happens to your daughter and your granddaughter, then tell me, tell me you'll choose history over your own family.<eos> That offer to clear the air still good?<eos> So long as it doesn't involve punching me in the jaw again.<eos> I'm sorry about that.<eos> After five years, I found myself blaming you for the choice I made.
Cisco and Caitlin and I, as you know, worked together for some time and...<eos> I miss the camaraderie.<eos> Legion of Doom doesn't have Karaoke Fridays?<eos> I know it's easier for you to think of me as a monster.<eos> But, um, I've met some of history's monsters, Raymond, and believe me, I'm not one of them.<eos> You killed Barry's mother.<eos> Twice.<eos> Rex Tyler.<eos> Brainwashed Rip into killing Dr. Mid-Nite.<eos> Time travel has a way of revealing the truth to you.
"Apollo 13" is headed home.<eos> Jax, restore the feed.<eos> Let's get history back on track.<eos> _<eos> "Odyssey," this is Houston.<eos> Do you read us?<eos> Come in, "Odyssey." "Odyssey," this is Houston.<eos> Houston, this is "Odyssey," do you read me?<eos> I repeat, do you read me?<eos> We read you, "Odyssey."
Not to mention the difficulty of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I'm saying that our crew has an infinitesimal chance of ever returning home.<eos> By "infinitesimal," I mean...<eos> A snowball's chance in hell?<eos> That would look rosy in comparison.<eos> Welcome aboard.<eos> Relax.<eos> I'm not gonna kill my ride home.<eos> Yeah, we still don't trust you.

I know this is cheesy, but, um... once you see Earth from outer space, you realize how small we all are.<eos> In a good way?<eos> Yeah.<eos> In a good way.<eos> Gideon.<eos> I need you to help me with something.<eos> Of course, Ms. Jiwe.<eos> I need you to show me the historical record on Zambesi, starting with my return home.<eos> You're asking for me to show you your future.<eos> I must counsel you against doing this.
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.<eos> Leonard.<eos> I must be losing my mind.<eos> The reason why Snart and I got on so well was we trusted one another.<eos> We were friends.<eos> Have either of you gentlemen heard of the Spear of Destiny?<eos> The spear could alter reality itself.<eos> We broke it into four separate pieces.<eos> Mr. Hunter took one...<eos> And took the rest of you to three different time periods, which means the last piece unaccounted for must be with your grandfather.
And I imagine that the view from the trenches is pretty bleak.<eos> It looks to me like the end of the world.<eos> But it's not.<eos> Believe me, this darkness will pass.<eos> You speak as someone who's seen the future.<eos> Haven't all students of history?<eos> Those who suffer heal.<eos> Everything destroyed gets rebuilt.<eos> And our towers grow a little taller every time.<eos> I should like to believe you.
I think I found our outlier.<eos> "Then push further still."<eos> This structure's been damaged from all the fighting.<eos> Sir Gawain, I presume.<eos> Hey, look, on his shield, it's an engraving.<eos> Pretty pathetic, if you ask me.<eos> Mr. Snart?<eos> Wait, you can see him?<eos> You're supposed to be dead.<eos> Yeah, they told me all about how I get soft and die for you losers. I didn't believe them.
To keep our family and our legacy safe.<eos> She wants me to change my destiny.<eos> Maybe the spear can do that for her.<eos> The chance to rewrite reality.<eos> Who wouldn't be tempted?<eos> What do you hear?<eos> My parents.<eos> What are they saying?<eos> "Don't play with fire, Mick."<eos> Mick, Amaya, I need you in here.
We won't last five minutes out there.<eos> It's not too late to use it.<eos> Loser.<eos> Commander, we may request a moment of your time.<eos> We are in the midst of battle.<eos> There are no moments...<eos> Lieutenant Tolkien.<eos> I was told you were suffering from trench fever, and you better be, or else I report you as a deserter.<eos> Captain Hunter, Royal Army Medical Corps.<eos> Now, I can assure you that this man is no deserter.
What more could you possibly want?<eos> How about the Spear of Destiny?<eos> There are still some things in this world that I would like to see change.<eos> How many times do I have to tell you this, Malcolm?<eos> The Spear is safest in my hands.<eos> Besides, I'm the only one who knows how to use it.<eos> That's because you destroyed the Kalabros Manuscript.<eos> Well, it's not my fault you don't retain information like I do.<eos> Speedster brains are handy that way.<eos> Mr. Jackson is here to see you.
I haven't seen my wife and daughter in weeks.<eos> You want to see your family?<eos> Then you will get that reactor working by tomorrow night.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> There's too much data...<eos> Get it working!<eos> Or you will never see that precious family of yours again.<eos> Somebody clean this place up!<eos> It's a damn mess.<eos> I'm so sorry, may I help you with that?
There's only so many times you can tell the President of the United States that you'll call him back.<eos> You want to get to the point?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I brought you here to discuss a... sensitive matter, and it goes by the name of Malcolm Merlyn.<eos> What about him?<eos> Want you to keep an eye on him for me.<eos> We're not your watchdogs.<eos> What was that?<eos> What he meant was, we're not spies. We're thieves.<eos> Mr. Thawne, I need to speak with you!
You will do as I tell you, Gideon, I'm your captain!<eos> Then it's time for you to start acting like one.<eos> Now, sit up straight and show your backbone, Captain Hunter.<eos> Gideon, for the thousandth time, I've got no way of getting the reserve power back online, and I've got no way of... Of sending out any signal of any sort, which means...<eos> Which means that I am destined to live out the rest of my days right... here... with you.<eos> While you were honing your confectionary skills, I've been working on new algorithms to redirect power from the idle quadrants of the ship.<eos> You need to focus on boosting your distress signal once power is fully back online.<eos> Now, chin up, Captain.<eos> I don't know if I can do this, Gideon.<eos> I believe in you.
And where, pray tell, is your partner, Miss Lance?<eos> We got separated in the fight.<eos> I haven't heard from her since, so I'm guessing she's dead by now.<eos> That's the thing about Sara Lance, she never stays dead for very long.<eos> Sorry, we underestimated them.<eos> Won't happen again. We'll fix this.<eos> Let's go.<eos> not so fast.<eos> Yes?<eos> I have a question for you.
Everything's on schedule, Mr. Thawne.<eos> You have nothing to worry about.<eos> Hey. What do you want?<eos> There's just one thing I don't understand.<eos> If Thawne made this world to punish us, how are your mom's sandwiches so good, bro?<eos> Her condiment game's on point, right?<eos> She even had gluten-free bread for me.<eos> Look, let's just get back to the ship.<eos> We don't know where the ship is, or Rip, which means our next move should be to rescue the Professor.<eos> Speaking of which, what did Thone have you to working on?
Did you just press the silent alarm?<eos> What?<eos> No, it's... It's a secondary radiation sensor for the nuclear core.<eos> Grey, you are a crappy liar in any reality.<eos> Martin.<eos> I can't talk any sense into him, and he just triggered an alarm.<eos> Which means Thawne'll be here soon.<eos> Or now.<eos> Well, looks like you losers managed to remember who you are.<eos> I should've wiped you from existence when I had the chance.
Which means Thawne'll be here soon.<eos> Or now.<eos> Well, looks like you losers managed to remember who you are.<eos> I should've wiped you from existence when I had the chance.<eos> Do you have any idea how infuriating it is to know that Merlyn was right?<eos> Lucky for you, I still believe in some fates worse than death.<eos> Like me destroying the Spear and cementing this reality for all time.<eos> Martin.<eos> The reactor is fully operational, sir.<eos> This... is the only reality any of you will ever know.
This... is the only reality any of you will ever know.<eos> We'll never give up trying to stop you.<eos> Well... if it weren't for your futile efforts, this wouldn't be half so sweet.<eos> Not so fast, speedy.<eos> You have something we want.<eos> You need a lesson in how to share your toys, Eobard.<eos> Yeah, time for us to get a turn with the Spear.<eos> And do what with it?<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> I'm trying to protect you from yourselves.
You have something we want.<eos> You need a lesson in how to share your toys, Eobard.<eos> Yeah, time for us to get a turn with the Spear.<eos> And do what with it?<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> I'm trying to protect you from yourselves.<eos> With the Spear destroyed...<eos> Bored now.<eos> Get the Spear!<eos> Let go of the Spear, and I won't use it to turn you into a jockstrap.
Now you can't stop us from killing you.<eos> Please. Don't insult my intelligence.<eos> Even at your fastest, you're moving in slow motion to me.<eos> Except they're not alone.<eos> I say we go down fighting.<eos> You kill one of us, we kill all of you.<eos> For Amaya.<eos> Don't.<eos> Even if you survive my men, you'll never survive me, not without powers or weapons.<eos> And the truth is, I don't want to see any more of you dead.
You will walk this world knowing that something isn't quite right, that for all your trying you only made things worse, and no one will ever believe you when you tell them about all the sacrifices you made and how close you came to being Legends.<eos> Now, that sounds like a fitting punishment to me.<eos> What do you think, Professor Stein?<eos> I don't care what you do to them, as long as I never have to see Mr. Jackson again.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> You're just gonna let them walk?<eos> Be glad I'm letting you and your fellow traitors do the same.<eos> And the next time any of you get what you think is a smart idea, remember this grace.<eos> And the fact I could kill any of you in the blink of an eye.
Filthy! Filthy!<eos> -Aww, a monkey.<eos> Um, just for regular reasons.<eos> Aloha, Lillian.<eos> The hello kind.<eos> Don't hang up!<eos> [stammering] I have a Lillian task for you.<eos> Go to the deli and get me some tea.<eos> The stronger, the better.<eos> Well, then I have a task for you.
[Titus sighs] Don't get me started.<eos> If I wanted to see a bunch of naked animals, I'd watch The Robin Byrd Show and-- I don't have time for this.<eos> Lillian, I need your advice.<eos> Just so you know, you're on speakerphone.<eos> Artie Goodman here.<eos> [Titus] Now I want to do a rant about speakerphones.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> You ever try to do a conference call on speaker?<eos> Sir, you should be able to tell that I have not.<eos> Lillian, I'm calling you because I know Kimmy would not give me the answer that I want.
I didn't know you had it in you.<eos> No, they left... after voting unanimously to support Big Naturals.<eos> That's it.<eos> I give up.<eos> No, that's not an option.<eos> I don't agree with you on everything, like during your filibuster when you ranked ethnicities from best to worst, but I admire your passion.<eos> So I insisted that you be the community liaison for this project.<eos> Nothing gets done without your okay.<eos> Huge mistake, pal.<eos> I'm gonna fight you every step of the way!
Attacking the symbol of your own privilege!<eos> Like Siddhartha Gautama renouncing his father's kingdom in order to become the Buddha.<eos> I'm a professor of religious symbology, like Robert Langdon in The Da Vinci Code.<eos> I also have an albino after me, but that's a whole other deal.<eos> Hey, Xan, you chose to attack the family crest with alcohol, knowing that the Voorhees family used liquor to lure Irish children into their factories.<eos> And you intentionally targeted this image of a horse because the Voorhees fortune came from making glue from horses' faces.<eos> [Koontz] So thank you, Xanthippe.<eos> The university should've removed that offensive crest ages ago.<eos> Wait, what about horses?<eos> Koontz, I need to talk to you about a special admission case.
Koontz, I need to talk to you about a special admission case.<eos> -I'm kind of in the middle of--<eos> -I'm sorry. Did you interrupt me?<eos> I wasn't done, Koontz. -I-I--<eos> -Is your mouth okay, nerd?<eos> I didn't mean to. I'm sorry, Coach Tannen.<eos> Coach, this is her! She's the badass that pulled a sub-seven on the erg.<eos> Young lady, how would you like to row for Columbia on a full scholarship starting immediately?<eos> Um, the Ivy League doesn't actually award--<eos> Was I talking to you, glasses?
As far as they're concerned, that's exactly what we'd be doing.<eos> Chin, you talk to Bumpy yet?<eos> No. I thought it would be best to wait until you got here.<eos> Well, let's get him down here.<eos> I'm sorry we have to meet again under these circumstances.<eos> Us, too.<eos> Look, HPD seems to believe that the man you're harboring may have committed a murder, but you're, convinced he's innocent.<eos> Tell us why.<eos> Because he told me so.<eos> He told you so.
Or how I spent ten months behind bars after an HPD officer falsely accused me of pointing a gun at him.<eos> The Makapu'u lighthouse occupation.<eos> I can't get that time back, but I can make sure that no other injustice happens to anyone else.<eos> This guy is not even a part of your community.<eos> He's outside of your protection.<eos> He's still Kanaka.<eos> Then where was he during your protests?<eos> Your occupations, your community meetings.<eos> He's only here because it's convenient.<eos> He's using you, Bumpy.
This situation is now a Federal matter.<eos> And I see for question 23 on the roommate compatibility questionnaire, you answered "false" in regards to whether we actually went to the moon.<eos> Yes.<eos> So you're of the school of thought that NASA faked the moon landing.<eos> No. I don't believe that the moon exists.<eos> Go on.<eos> An overwhelming amount of evidence suggests that there's a high probability that our reality is just a simulation.<eos> We are all merely avatars being controlled by other creatures.<eos> Sorry, Doug. It appears our time has come to an end.<eos> But it was great meeting you, and I will be in touch.
Okay, right.<eos> I don't.<eos> But if I can't find a roommate, then I may have to go back to sleeping on the sofa in his office, and I can't imagine he'd like that.<eos> Fair point.<eos> Come on.<eos> They brought an army for this?<eos> Look, Bumpy, I don't know what to tell you.<eos> We didn't know they were coming, all right?<eos> McGarrett!<eos> We trusted you, and this is what happens?
So tell me what I'm missing.<eos> What you're missing is what this land means to these people... It's all they have left.<eos> And any attempt to cross that border will end in violence.<eos> What he's trying to say, sir... is that these people will die to protect it, okay?<eos> Now, right now, we're in peaceful negotiations.<eos> No one's gotten hurt.<eos> No threats have been made.<eos> No one is in any danger.<eos> Now, do you really want to explain to the attorney general why you took action without provocation?<eos> I'll give you until sundown to resolve the situation peacefully.
Okay, so where do you get one of these, Neo...<eos> Neodymium.<eos> Magnets, yeah.<eos> It's an industrial-strength magnet, difficult to come by in a strength powerful enough to move safe tumblers, unless you're in the locksmith business.<eos> Wait a minute... Akemoto used to be in the locksmith business for years.<eos> Okay, so what if Akemoto and Kanuha were back in business.<eos> And then they get into a disagreement and one turns on the other?<eos> Exactly what I was thinking.<eos> That's nice work, Jerry.<eos> Hey, do either of you know who
See, that's just nasty.<eos> Y'all.<eos> Glock 29.<eos> Looks like we found our murder weapon.<eos> Kanuha, we know you rented the storage unit.<eos> And right now our lab's running ballistics on the gun we found inside to confirm it is the murder weapon!<eos> So you can stand there and tell me you're innocent all day long, but we both know you're lying!<eos> All right, all right!<eos> I stole all that stuff, including that gun, but I didn't kill Akemoto.<eos> Why should I believe you?
Here's the truth...<eos> A man was murdered and you ran, and every single thing that we've discovered since then points to you as having pulled the trigger!<eos> Kanuha.<eos> Come here.<eos> Look in my eyes.<eos> Tell me you didn't kill Akemoto.<eos> I didn't kill Akemoto.<eos> I believe him.<eos> I believe that you and your partner were pulling jobs again.<eos> The two of you got into a beef and then you shot him.
Or else I tell my brother that you crossed the line and he puts you back in jail.<eos> Okay, fine, let's say I buy all that... why kill Akemoto?<eos> Let's go ask Devon Berris.<eos> What are they doing?<eos> It's aerial surveillance.<eos> They're preparing to move in.<eos> You could stop them by giving up Kanuha.<eos> You know I can't do that.<eos> Excuse me, Chin.<eos> That gentleman... he asked to speak to you.

When we got Kanuha on those robberies, why didn't he give us Devon Berris then?<eos> Because, just like you and Kono said, the guy's been under this other guy's thumb.<eos> He's too scared to say anything.<eos> Yeah, I need Lieutenant Chin Ho Kelly.<eos> This is Danny Williams, please.<eos> I want you to post two men on every sniper.<eos> I want 'em to feel HPD breathing down their necks.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Lieutenant Kelly.<eos> Commander McGarrett on the line for you.
- I don't think it's necessary.<eos> - You need us?<eos> - We'll stick around for you.<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> Yeah, we'll stick around.<eos> - Winston!<eos> - Winston!<eos> Me!<eos> Did you make police work look as boring as possible?<eos> I want so badly to tell you yes, but there was a situation.
You check in, you stay a while, you check out.<eos> Well, that's a weird place for a tattoo.<eos> This is Joan Grayson with the county coroner's office.<eos> I need to speak with Detective Trejo in homicide.<eos> Right now.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> - Hi. - Mmm!<eos> I missed you so much.<eos> You must be Walker.<eos> Great to finally meet you.
Oh, come in.<eos> No problem.<eos> My goodness.<eos> You must be quite a reader.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I am.<eos> And I'm so sorry about the mess. We had a, uh, we had a little bit of an accident.<eos> Come, meet my mom.<eos> Mom, this is miss Campbell from the agency.<eos> Miss Campbell, this is my mother Diana Reid.<eos> Very nice to meet you, ma'am.
Yes, I know. In terms of conventional treatment, I entirely agree.<eos> And that's why I sent her to Houston in the first place, but there's a vast amount of literature and research on the workings of the human brain, and we have not even begun to scratch the surface.<eos> Personally, I believe that great breakthroughs, especially in medicine, often come from thinking outside the box, which...<eos> Yes, but the box is there for a reason, Dr. Reid.<eos> I mean, safety, quality of life, controlled environment.<eos> Your mother needs that.<eos> My strong recommendation is that you put her in an assisted care facility.<eos> I'm not gonna do that.<eos> You're not gonna do that. I'm not.<eos> That being the case, I'd be happy to help you with your mother.
Notify Chief Bailor to leave the body and crime scene undisturbed until we get there.<eos> Consider it done.<eos> JJ, why don't you, Tara, and Luke go to the newest disposal site.<eos> Dave, Stephen, find out what you can about the first victim from the club.<eos> Spencer and I will go to the Palm Springs P.D. and talk to the chief.<eos> He's got his hands full.<eos> We're very sorry about the officers you lost.<eos> Worst thing in the department's history.<eos> But right now we have to focus on this case.<eos> I've got conference room set up for you right over here with everything you've got so far.
Hi. Oh.<eos> If you're from social services, I haven't told her yet.<eos> Are you gonna take me to my daddy now?<eos> No, not yet, sweetheart.<eos> Actually, we are from the FBI.<eos> What's FBI? Whoa!<eos> That is a cool doll.<eos> What's her name?<eos> Sally.<eos> She has the same hair as you.
We're very sorry for your loss.<eos> I can't stop imagining what Dale went through.<eos> What they did to my brother is inhuman.<eos> And we are doing everything we can to make sure whoever is responsible is brought to justice.<eos> This unsub seems to be targeting men who were having relationship troubles.<eos> Do you know if Dale was going through a breakup or anything?<eos> Yes, but he said it was just a fling.<eos> He's really careful, though, about dating.<eos> He'd never just go off with some guy he didn't know and trust from the local gay community.<eos> Did his sexuality cause any issues between you two? I encouraged him to be himself and live his life.
You... you...<eos> That's why I need to do this.<eos> I need you to hurt the way I hurt.<eos> FBI!<eos> Drop it and show me your hands.<eos> It's ok.<eos> It's over.<eos> You're ok.<eos> Oh, my God. He was... oh, my God.<eos> Is there someone we can call for you?
We need Lewis and Walker here asap. Yeah.<eos> I can call them.<eos> I can do that.<eos> I'm gonna run some tests to figure out what you're on right now.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Helpful.<eos> We're having a hard time finding this Dr. Rosa.<eos> You still don't remember her last name or where you met her?<eos> I'm trying.<eos> When my officers chased you, you were racing toward the border.
I can't believe I didn't pick up on any of this.<eos> He didn't want you to, and there's no way you would have guessed he'd end up in Mexico.<eos> The question is, why did he go down there?<eos> And why does he have narcotics?<eos> Yeah, exactly. That... that...<eos> He wouldn't... he wouldn't do that.<eos> I'm not gonna share any secrets I'm not supposed to, but those drugs were planted on him.<eos> Absolutely. But there's something bigger in play.<eos> That's why he crossed the border and kept it a secret.<eos> There's something he didn't want to share with any of you.
- Nice blazer.<eos> - Where'd you get it?<eos> - Does it matter?<eos> I just want to know where I can get one, so I can look like a total fucking douchebag.<eos> Wow, right?<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Gents, why don't we take this... party outside?<eos> Yes, we live in California.<eos> We should take advantage of it.<eos> Gavin, you told me to interrupt if Jack Barker came to see you. I'm sorry.
You can point it at an office window from a mile away and read the sound vibrations.<eos> I like it.<eos> Hoover, you're the only person I can trust at this goddamn company.<eos> It's good to have a friend.<eos> I understand that, sir.<eos> Gavin, there you are.<eos> I don't want to interrupt your talking with Hoover... and talking and talking about things, but I have some concrete news.<eos> - Regarding?<eos> - Jack Barker.<eos> By forgoing Western gadgetry, simply stationing myself in the hall outside of his office, I was able to overhear him speaking of his plans to move against you.

Smellson."
I was about to throw you a massive acquisition deal, and then I realized you'd already publicly admitted to stealing my IP.<eos> I hope you have a good lawyer.<eos> He works at the car wash down the street.<eos> What?<eos> Look, Gavin, you do not want to do this.<eos> - I can't explain exactly why.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> This is not a negotiation.<eos> If you fight me, I will win, and I will fuck you in the tech business forever.<eos> No one will hire you.
Eight different ways to make a Chinese recipe, octopus.<eos> So I just traded one year... of free rent, full pool privileges, and more room in the crisper for an application that is just... eight recipes for octopus?<eos> Hey, guys, they're ready.<eos> What the fuck is this?<eos> I went through every chat in his history.<eos> They're all the same.<eos> Perhaps it was another chat format.<eos> Could you acquire Skype or FaceTime and check them as well?<eos> Uh, Gavin, I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> I need to talk to you about this PiperChat acquisition.
Hey, you know, they say that after Alan Turing was chemically castrated, he got a lot less annoying.<eos> - What was that?<eos> Nothing. Just... that's just something to think about.<eos> Okay. Sure, yeah.<eos> Pen, please.<eos> Right, yeah.<eos> Go ahead and pay the lady out front.<eos> Cash is always appreciated.<eos> How the hell does this thing work?<eos> Question for you.
- S-E-E food. - Oh.<eos> - SeeFood.<eos> - Now, that we like.<eos> Seafood. It's like food in the sea.<eos> Gavin. I heard about your PiperChat issue.<eos> Those COPPA fines are no joke, could be billions.<eos> I'm acutely aware, Jack.<eos> Listen, after all you've done for me... bringing me into the Hooli sandbox, letting me play here... what if, hypothetically, I had a way to delete the underage accounts and the chat data in question?<eos> Hypothetically, I could blame it on a malfunction of my Endframe/Box servers.<eos> The board would have nothing to blame you for.
- I mean, it's like, wow.<eos> Just FYI.<eos> I actually did some image recognition stuff on Nip Alert, so maybe you could hire me to help on the demo, 'cause my dad's been, like, kinda on me lately to, like, get a job or go to school 'cause... 'cause he's upset that I lost all that money on... on PiperChat.<eos> And then also, you helped me lose that 20 million on Bachmanity.<eos> Big Head, um...<eos> Jian-Yang's culture... he's...<eos> Chinese... won't allow him to accept outside help.<eos> Oh, right, 'cause of Chinese.<eos> Okay, well, that makes sense.<eos> If either of you could aid in the construction of this image recognition software, I can pay you handsomely.
Oh, Bachmanity was my VC fund.<eos> What?<eos> - It stands for Venture Capital.<eos> - I know. Umm...<eos> Wait. Nelson Bighetti.<eos> Were you on the cover of WIRED magazine?<eos> Yeah, and actually inside, too.<eos> Can I get you some coffee?<eos> The last 24 hours have been very painful.<eos> But in the days to come, what I will be thinking of most is all of you, the good people of Hooli, and what we've built together.

We will scour the camp and beyond!<eos> We are looking for the Lady Aethelflaed!<eos> Where are you taking me?<eos> You have found your voice.<eos> We're headed to Beamfleot.<eos> And then?<eos> A ship?<eos> A cage?<eos> I'm still to decide.<eos> I have given up Lunden for you.
A cage?<eos> I'm still to decide.<eos> I have given up Lunden for you.<eos> Erik! How does she feel? Warm?<eos> Rich.<eos> As she should.<eos> She is our pathway to glory.<eos> What will you say to Alfred?<eos> What can I tell him but the truth?<eos> He will ask why she was with you.
You will remain there and, yes, you are to spy.<eos> Sihtric, I will need to know every part of Beamfleot.<eos> Every blade of grass that surrounds their fortress.<eos> Yes, Lord.<eos> See this?<eos> Warriors join us by the day.<eos> With word of your capture, there will be more. All waiting for war.<eos> You have my thanks, Lady.<eos> There will be many men inside.<eos> They will want to get close to you, look you in the eye.
They will want to get close to you, look you in the eye.<eos> They'll want to frighten me.<eos> They will.<eos> What did I say?<eos> I told you I would invite<eos> King Alfred's daughter, and she is here!<eos> I swear to the gods... ..that this prize will not be sold cheaply.<eos> There will be wealth and glory for every man here.<eos> It is the best we have.<eos> These are my own men, they will watch you.
Lunden has been reclaimed.<eos> Praise God.<eos> Not a single Northman has been left alive in the city... but this great victory has come at a significant cost.<eos> It is the way of battle.<eos> It concerns Aethelflaed, Lord.<eos> What of her?<eos> We fear that she has been... taken.<eos> We pray that is the outcome, Lord.<eos> By the Northmen?<eos> Aethelflaed was with you?
She has her mother's courage, and that is the very reason that she will survive this ordeal.<eos> Lord King, although I would usually prefer him miles away at Coccham... ..would it now be appropriate to recall Uhtred to Winchester?<eos> I accept that he will never know God...<eos> I cannot.<eos> But if you would send him to Beamfleot, if she saw him...<eos> You know that I cannot.<eos> ..perhaps her spirit would rise. She believes in him.<eos> Our belief is in God, in prayer.<eos> It is.<eos> I will leave you to your letters.
Lord.<eos> I thought you'd like to breathe the night's air.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I was born on a night of a whole moon.<eos> My father wanted to call me Mani, after the moon god.<eos> But Mani is chased each night across the sky by Hati the wolf.<eos> My mother did not want me to be chased by wolves.<eos> I saw the moon, the clear sky and I wanted to share it.<eos> I'm glad you thought of me.<eos> It was either share it with you or with my brother.
It was either share it with you or with my brother.<eos> The choice was difficult, I admit!<eos> I have never seen a face like this before.<eos> Now I see it, even when I close my eyes.<eos> Your husband is a fortunate man.<eos> My husband does not see me.<eos> Then, he's blind or stupid.<eos> He is not blind.<eos> And he is not gentle, I would guess.<eos> He is the one who mistreats you?
He is not the man I would choose to be with.<eos> You. You!<eos> Aethelwold.<eos> Odda, you are drunk.<eos> I sincerely hope so, I can barely see.<eos> At your age, it is not good for you.<eos> What is your opinion on paying a ransom for Aethelflaed?<eos> Do you have an opinion?<eos> Not one I am prepared to say aloud.<eos> Is there much, or any, of your father in you? The king past?
There will be a heathen sacrifice the youngest member of the visiting party will be split with an axe.<eos> They will want to humiliate us.<eos> In what way?<eos> An insult, a challenge.<eos> Why Because they can.<eos> Haesten.<eos> We're travelling to Beamfleot.<eos> For Alfred?<eos> For Alfred, yes.<eos> I am here to take you on to the fortress, Lord. You and two others.
I will not.<eos> Kneel!<eos> I have come to negotiate.<eos> I demand respect.<eos> If you do not wish to hear my price, then I will leave! Happily!<eos> Aethelflaed.<eos> As you can see, she is well.<eos> I would like to speak with her.<eos> Then, do it.<eos> They are treating you well?
As you can see, she is well.<eos> I would like to speak with her.<eos> Then, do it.<eos> They are treating you well?<eos> They are.<eos> You have not been... touched?<eos> I have not.<eos> What I must now do is secure an acceptable price for your release.<eos> There will be word games played, do not be alarmed by what I may say.<eos> I assure you, once this is over, they shall pay for what they have done to us all.
With my brother.<eos> Lord Uhtred.<eos> Lady.<eos> Your father sends his affection.<eos> He will be sleeping at the altar, I'm sure.<eos> I have arranged your release.<eos> You will soon be coming home.<eos> Have you spoken with Erik?<eos> I have.<eos> What has he told you?
I can say this to no-one but you.<eos> I can ask no-one but you.<eos> Will you help us escape?<eos> Lady, I am sworn to your father.<eos> If I help you and succeed, he'll have me killed, but more than that, you are asking me to sanction your own death.<eos> No, what I am asking is for you to allow me to live!<eos> I will not be the treasure that builds an army against my father. That will not happen.<eos> Never.<eos> I will leave this place with Erik or I will not leave at all.<eos> Uhtred, I am asking you to save my life and with it the nations of Wessex and Mercia.
We need one more.<eos> And after Badenweiler, where did you go.<eos> To Oslo.<eos> On June 19th.<eos> You can't end this.<eos> We're gonna do whatever it takes to protect this countr...<eos> So will we.<eos> So, I owe you a drink, huh?<eos> It's ironic, isn't it?<eos> I spent the last three months teaching you how to be an operative.
She didn't do it with a gun or badge.<eos> She did it from a desk at a German bank, tracking dirty money flooding out of post-Soviet Russia.<eos> I recruited her...<eos> I handled her and I buried her.<eos> The Russians unmasked her, and it was my job to get her out of the country.<eos> I tried.<eos> I failed.<eos> Russians got her first.<eos> She paid the price for my mistake.<eos> And I've spent the 15 years since then teaching hundreds of you not to follow in my footsteps.

I hacked Lydia's e-mails.<eos> Those are her communications with recruits at the Farm, past and present.<eos> SDRs, test aliases, recruiting assets.<eos> This is your curriculum.<eos> They're encrypted.<eos> It's a code very few people would recognize.<eos> But you do.<eos> It was the first code I ever taught her.<eos> Now you have your proof.<eos> What about you?
Nearly there.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Ivan?<eos> Still can't hear you, love.<eos> You're wasting your breath.<eos> The one thing... we can't waste.<eos> Need to bypass it.<eos> Oh, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no!<eos> ♪ Doctor Who 10x05 ♪ Oxygen Original Air Date on May 13, 2017<eos> So, how does space kill you?
You only really see the true face of the universe when it's asking for your help.<eos> I haven't seen MY true face in years.<eos> Swapped it for this one on the run.<eos> Oh, look, Bill, it's Nardole!<eos> What a lovely surprise!<eos> Thought I sent you to Birmingham for a packet of crisps.<eos> Yeah, I saw through your cunning ruse...!<eos> Yes, well, if you will go thinking for yourself...<eos> What do you want?<eos> I was given strict instructions to keep you at the university.
- What's a fluid link?<eos> - No idea.<eos> But the TARDIS can't go anywhere without it.<eos> - Who told you that?<eos> - You did!<eos> Exactly!<eos> Teach you to trust me.<eos> No...<eos> I'm docking your pay for this.<eos> - I'm a bit cross with you, sir. - Noted.
Right, where's your ship?<eos> We're parked just off your repair station.<eos> Then you might as well be on the moon.<eos> - They're swarming round there now.<eos> - It's just maths now.<eos> Oxygen divided by bodies.<eos> And none of us have more than 3,000 breaths left.<eos> Then stop wasting them.<eos> I need a map of the base and a full rundown on what happened here.<eos> Who the hell put you in charge?
Suit...<eos> Velma?<eos> - 'Good morning.<eos> How may I assist? ' - Shhh, shh!<eos> - I can't move. - 'This suit is currently offline 'for diagnostic purposes.'<eos> Oh, Nardole!<eos> Ivan!<eos> Thank God!<eos> You're awake.<eos> Told you.
Oh, Nardole!<eos> Ivan!<eos> Thank God!<eos> You're awake.<eos> Told you.<eos> - You ok? - Shh.<eos> What happened?<eos> I can't move.<eos> Your suit set to auto.<eos> The Doctor hacked it and walked you out.
It's not in their mapping system.<eos> See!<eos> You know, like when your satnav doesn't know a new road?<eos> - So, they can't come here?<eos> - Not without a floor plan.<eos> Good.<eos> What happened to the Doctor?<eos> - I thought I saw him...<eos> - Yeah, he...<eos> The Doctor took you to safety.
- The TARDIS?<eos> I've got stuff in there that'll cure anything.<eos> Failing that, I think I've got some spare eyes somewhere.<eos> They're from a lizard, but I'm sure they'll fit.<eos> So, until then...<eos> Until then, what?<eos> You really think this is going to slow me down?<eos> I do most of my best work ordering other people around.<eos> You do know we're still here, right?<eos> Didn't I send you out to get me a latte?

If there's a rescue ship on the way, then how can the rescue ship already be here?<eos> Too many rescue ships.<eos> There's a first-world problem.<eos> Who ARE you?<eos> I'm the Doctor.<eos> I will do everything in my power to save all your lives.<eos> And when I do, you will spend the rest of them wondering who I was and why I helped you.<eos> If anyone's offering a better deal, be my guest.<eos> You didn't save Tasker, did you?<eos> And he believed you.
That's all that matters.<eos> Yes, but she's not a warrior.<eos> She's an embryo.<eos> What did you do?<eos> Throw your action figures at them?<eos> Listen, Roman...<eos> We're not Roman. We're not part of the Roman army.<eos> No, we're not even slightly Italian.<eos> I mean, I do a mean spag bol.<eos> Let me tell you about the Romans.
How much food have we got left?<eos> Enough. Really?<eos> Shut up, Cornelius.<eos> Go on, eat it.<eos> It's two days, you haven't had anything.<eos> I've never been lost this long, I need to find him.<eos> Who?<eos> The Doctor, my friend.<eos> I don't know what I'm going to do if I can't find him.<eos> Well, we'll look after you.
I'll have to find my way home somehow.<eos> This is the safest place to be.<eos> The beast is still out there.<eos> You came back.<eos> Did you know what was in there?<eos> The gate.<eos> A portal between dimensions, do you know what's on the other side?<eos> You don't know anything, do you?<eos> You just stand around making speeches and waving a TV aerial about.<eos> Shall I tell you what's in there?
Then I'll hold them back.<eos> You'll hold them back?<eos> What, with your lollypop and your kiddy face paint and your crazy novelty monster killing tool?<eos> Are you holding that thing the right way up, by the way?<eos> I don't want your help! But I'm all you've got.<eos> Believe me, I'm on your side.<eos> Come on, let's go!<eos> We're all in this together.<eos> You're going to be fine.<eos> Marcus was hurt, like you, and the sunlight healed him in the end.

Yeah, don't worry, Bill. Lucius'll look after you.
So you thought the Eater Of Light could destroy a whole Roman army?<eos> It did.<eos> And a whole Roman army could weaken or kill the beast?<eos> Yes. Well, it didn't work.<eos> You got a Roman legion slaughtered and you made the deadliest creature on this planet very, very cross indeed.<eos> To protect a muddy little hillside, you doomed your whole world.<eos> One man.<eos> You think one man can save us all?<eos> Come and meet him.<eos> He came here to meet you.

You're scared.<eos> Scared is fine, scared is human.<eos> But I'll tell you what it isn't.<eos> It isn't a plan.<eos> She's right.<eos> Why are you even listening to her, Grandad?<eos> Because no-one else is saying anything.<eos> We need a plan.<eos> A real commander would have a plan.<eos> Why did he call you Grandad?
Our ancestors couldn't close the gate completely, but they built the cairn to control it.<eos> Like venting an oil gush.<eos> If they let the portal open a few moments every year, they stop the whole thing ripping apart.<eos> It's quite clever, really.<eos> Are you sulking?<eos> I'm remembering the dead.<eos> Oh, right. Well, save that for old age.<eos> They're dead because of me.<eos> You know, every moment you waste wallowing about in that happy thought means more of the living are going to join them.<eos> When you want to win a war, remember this - it's not about you.
The answer is me.<eos> I go on for ages.<eos> I don't even really die, I regenerate.<eos> I can hold that gate till the sun goes out.<eos> No, you can't!<eos> Course I can, I'm going to.<eos> This is not your job.<eos> No, it isn't, Bill.<eos> It's who I am.<eos> I've been standing by the gates of your world, keeping you all safe, since you crawled out of the slime.
No, you can't!<eos> Course I can, I'm going to.<eos> This is not your job.<eos> No, it isn't, Bill.<eos> It's who I am.<eos> I've been standing by the gates of your world, keeping you all safe, since you crawled out of the slime.<eos> I'm not stopping now!<eos> Doctor, please!<eos> Listen!<eos> The TARDIS will take you home, return journeys are easy.
Nobody else can!<eos> I can.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Time to grow up, Doctor.<eos> Time to fight my fight.<eos> I'm sorry, no.<eos> No-one else can do this, not like I can.<eos> We can.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> I'll guard the gate with you.
Awesome!<eos> Brilliant!<eos> You'll be a hero for two seconds.<eos> And then the whole solar system will be devoured.<eos> Stop him!<eos> This is my destiny.<eos> My fight.<eos> Out of my way. Now!<eos> We'll take it in turns.<eos> Two of you can't hold the gate.
-Holy crap.<eos> -I got you!<eos> If that ever got out...<eos> Give me that thing!<eos> That's how we do it in Chickasaw County, Mississippi.<eos> You- - What do you want?<eos> You're going to the owners' meeting this year, right? Yeah.<eos> It's gonna be epic. Steve Harvey's performing.<eos> He's just gonna hang out afterwards.<eos> Well, I'm coming with you.
Because I don't see a body, and I don't leave my friends behind.<eos> I'm going to rescue those who are deserving.<eos> If you'd like to show some gratitude, you can join me instead of wasting time on him.<eos> Dr. Rivera, he's bucking the vent.<eos> Dr. Rivera?<eos> I need a doctor now!<eos> Woman over P.A.:<eos> Dr. Rivera to Trauma 1.<eos> Dr. Rivera to Trauma 1.<eos> I'm gonna help you.
- Mac.<eos> How can I relax when...<eos> He's seizing.<eos> Uh, nurse, Ativan!<eos> Our guy probably has a bleed.<eos> He needs a scan now.<eos> C.T. is down, and there is no MRI.<eos> The V.A. stands for Veteran's Affairs, or did you forget that?<eos> Your job is to help veterans, not leave them hanging out to dry.<eos> Look, I am here with my floor nurse doing triage, who, by the way, is trying to help you.
The issue isn't really in doubt.<eos> If he survived an operation, and that's a big "if," we bought him 9 months, 12 months tops.<eos> That man has given more of his life serving us.<eos> That may be, but there comes a point where surgery is no longer feasible for either party.<eos> So... you're just gonna let this man die because what?<eos> His bank account's a couple bucks short?<eos> You think you know me?<eos> Read it.<eos> "Dear Dr. Cummings, "my name is Jesse, I am 6 years old, "and my mommy is dying.<eos> "She has the cancer inside, and I'm writing to ask you if you can..."
What's it gonna be?<eos> What's it gonna be?<eos> Right over here.<eos> We got a fractured pelvis.<eos> Let's get a binder on her.<eos> - He's urgent surgical.<eos> Go.<eos> - We got a problem, docs.<eos> We got two girls up in the coaster upside down.<eos> Paramedics need one of you to come take a look.
Yeah. Both of us are.<eos> We had the police bring this in.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> But I'm afraid the damage is done.<eos> I missed my audition.<eos> No.<eos> You're gonna do it from right here.<eos> Maybe not ideal, but it's the only way we can control the noise.<eos> You all are too much.<eos> I can't thank you enough.
Woman: You may begin, sir.<eos> Please help us!<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Please!<eos> Please help!<eos> Man: Doctor on the way, girls!<eos> Stay calm!<eos> It'll be all right!<eos> We'll get you down!
Please, no...<eos> Sofia, you're gonna fall safely down to the airbag.<eos> I'm not falling down there!<eos> I can't do that!<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> You look like a badass.<eos> You can do this.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> You have to. I can only fit one of you in here.
But end of business, your money's gonna be cleaner than a nun's browser history.<eos> While you're redistributing, an investment opportunity has come up.<eos> I need funds in that amount.<eos> What are you buying this time?<eos> Another herd of Akhal-Teke horses?<eos> Oh, God no.<eos> Although, one could never have enough of those beautiful animals.<eos> There is, however, a floundering cruise line in urgent need of a bail out.<eos> Elizabeth!<eos> I'd like to introduce you to one of my accountants,
What are you buying this time?<eos> Another herd of Akhal-Teke horses?<eos> Oh, God no.<eos> Although, one could never have enough of those beautiful animals.<eos> There is, however, a floundering cruise line in urgent need of a bail out.<eos> Elizabeth!<eos> I'd like to introduce you to one of my accountants,<eos> - Zack Smoll.<eos> - I'm an FBI agent.<eos> Mr. Reddington is my CI, which forces me to ignore his crimes, which will no doubt include murdering you if either of you ever tell anyone.
And with the Witness Protection list out in the open, the timing is no coincidence.<eos> Every one of those witnesses would be in danger if their identities get out.<eos> Which makes the list extraordinarily valuable.<eos> And irresistible to the Harem.<eos> Catch them in the act of stealing it, and you'll save the lives of everyone on that list.<eos> - How exactly are we supposed to catch them in the act?<eos> - You can't.<eos> And if you can't beat them, as the saying goes...<eos> Join them?<eos> That's Reddington's plan to put you undercover in a heist crew?
Little birdie told us.<eos> It's the same little birdie who, uh, told us that you have a brother doing six years for armed robbery.<eos> You vouch for Agent Keen here and, uh, maybe Jimmy will get out in time for the Super Bowl.<eos> I knew Margot.<eos> She likes to know the people she works with.<eos> Control.<eos> She'll smell a lie on me a mile away.<eos> We'll go over our story until we forget it's a lie.<eos> You're still gonna have to prove yourself.<eos> Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.
- Good.<eos> Shoot him.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!<eos> I'm told the feds are kicking your baby brother for "good behavior."<eos> And since his behavior is never good, that means he cut a deal or...<eos> - ...or you cut one for him.<eos> - That's crazy.<eos> I'd never do that.<eos> Never sell me out to save your own flesh and blood?<eos> I told you to shoot him.
Never sell me out to save your own flesh and blood?<eos> I told you to shoot him.<eos> Shoot him yourself.<eos> I gave you an order.<eos> No, you gave me a test, and I'm gonna tell you why I passed.<eos> You don't need blind followers.<eos> What you're interested in is loyalty.<eos> I worked with Craig.<eos> I'm loyal to him.<eos> Take me on, I'll be equally loyal to you.
Here we go.<eos> It's starting.<eos> Tell Reddington.<eos> See if he can find who did it.<eos> That person has the list-- or knows where to find it.<eos> I am sorry I'm late.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> I'm Carter Wilson.<eos> I spoke with your associate on the phone.<eos> I'm not entirely certain what I can do for you, Mr. Lockhart.
I'm Carter Wilson.<eos> I spoke with your associate on the phone.<eos> I'm not entirely certain what I can do for you, Mr. Lockhart.<eos> I'll be blunt, Mr. Wilson.<eos> Whistler Cruise Line is sinking.<eos> The band is on deck and warming up "Nearer My God to Thee."<eos> We're having some difficulties, but--<eos> Running aground on endangered coral reefs,<eos> E. coli at the buffet, sailing half-empty ships.<eos> Your difficulties are about to land you in bankruptcy court.
E. coli at the buffet, sailing half-empty ships.<eos> Your difficulties are about to land you in bankruptcy court.<eos> How on earth did you hear about that?<eos> Have you ever been to Mont Saint Michel?<eos> Tidal island in Normandy.<eos> The only way in or out used to be a causeway that disappeared at high tide.<eos> To reach the other side was a matter of knowing when the tide came in and seizing the opportunity before it arrived.<eos> I'm afraid I don't follow.<eos> I'm offering you a causeway, Carter.<eos> I bail you out, you transport my cargo.

Who is she anyway?<eos> Aram says her records have all been scrubbed.<eos> Yes.<eos> By MI-6.<eos> So she's a British agent?<eos> You can't think the FBI is the only law enforcement agency I have a relationship with.<eos> Elizabeth, none of this changes the fact that the WITSEC list is still in play.<eos> She knows who I am.<eos> Emma Knightly can be trusted.<eos> I wouldn't have put you in otherwise.

You wouldn't have put me in if she had been reporting back to you.<eos> So whether or not she can be trusted remains to be seen.<eos> What's so urgent?<eos> I found our in.<eos> To Helldritch?<eos> That was fast.<eos> I do a lot of favors.<eos> This, uh, cute little chola I had a fling with who leased server space to Helldritch for a ransomware scam.<eos> She'll know where Helldritch is.<eos> Why don't you bring on your social engineer with you?
He made me feel like I was the center of his universe.<eos> It was exciting and captivating and... it consumed me.<eos> My work, my marriage.<eos> I had no idea how many lines I was crossing until it was too late.<eos> It's never too late.<eos> Spoken like someone who's still in the honeymoon phase.<eos> Trust me, that ends.<eos> You should get out before it does.<eos> She knows you're FBI?<eos> Keen, we gotta pull you out.
It's never too late.<eos> Spoken like someone who's still in the honeymoon phase.<eos> Trust me, that ends.<eos> You should get out before it does.<eos> She knows you're FBI?<eos> Keen, we gotta pull you out.<eos> Margot's contact says Helldritch is in Hong Kong.<eos> We have no jurisdiction there.<eos> Our only shot at recovering the WITSEC list is to have The Harem steal it, and I've got to be there.<eos> - If Emma rolls on you?
He plays soccer.<eos> I go to visit him sometimes-- or at least I try.<eos> I usually just end up sitting in the car, watching him practice.<eos> I want to talk to him, but I don't know what I'd say.<eos> About what I have become.<eos> You act like it's too late.<eos> It isn't.<eos> You could still get out.<eos> I dream about that, the life I had, wishing I could get it back.<eos> I can help you.

Got it.<eos> Hey, we gotta go.<eos> You're good.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Hey, are you okay?<eos> Ooh.<eos> I'll muddle through.<eos> You've got blood on your face.<eos> Uh, go.<eos> We'll be right behind you.
Aram, can you--<eos> - Tracking them as we speak.<eos> - Look, what about the list?<eos> Emma took it.<eos> You were right.<eos> - Elizabeth, you know her.<eos> - Clearly, I don't.<eos> You do.<eos> More than any of us.<eos> What did she tell you?
I didn't think that was an option.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> So I'm out.<eos> The list.<eos> You need to let her go.<eos> Emma's disappeared.<eos> You got to her before we could.<eos> Yes.<eos> The list.<eos> She betrayed you, so you... killed her just like you killed Mr. Kaplan?
No one in their right mind would've been out in that kind of bitter cold, and if not for Dodger's aging bladder,<eos> I imagine Maureen would have been fast asleep.<eos> But as fate would have it, her neighbor, Alexei Lagunov the avtoritet of a Russian bratva, felt given the late hour and windchill, he and his boyeviks could move a body from his basement to the trunk of an associate's car without being observed.<eos> They didn't count on Dodger's call to nature.<eos> So Maureen had a choice between remaining silent or doing the right thing.<eos> She chose to testify.<eos> And while she helped to bring<eos> Alexei Lagunov to justice, she also forfeited the rest of her life in doing so.<eos> She's on that list.<eos> Who is she to you?
My contemporaries mock me, but we'll be laughing when we find the gold.<eos> Here are the maps of the areas we'll be searching from our respective boats.<eos> These are our pirate vessels?<eos> Sturdy 40-foot fishing vessels.<eos> Just had them serviced.<eos> More than sufficient for our work.<eos> When we find the treasure, I'll call for larger ships with retrieval cranes.<eos> Okay. Let's get to work.<eos> So, Paige and I will start in the small boat.<eos> The rest of you go with Joan.
They're just having some sort of technical issue.<eos> Right, Hap?<eos> It's possible that an electrical issue on the boat knocked out the comms and the submersible's signal.<eos> You go get that.<eos> I'll try to reboot the connection to Ethel Mer-man.<eos> Oh.<eos> Hi, Allie.<eos> Cabe's not here.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm here to see you.
I'll try to reboot the connection to Ethel Mer-man.<eos> Oh.<eos> Hi, Allie.<eos> Cabe's not here.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm here to see you.<eos> I feel bad about the wizard commercial, so I want to make it up to you.<eos> This is Patty Logan.<eos> She's a reporter with the West Altadenia Shopper.<eos> She'd like to interview you.
She'd like to interview you.<eos> Hello.<eos> You're a teenager.<eos> I work at the Shopper for school credit, but my age isn't relevant.<eos> Oh.<eos> I need to run, but I'll leave you two to discuss the issues.<eos> Good luck, Sylvester.<eos> Uh... Please, come in.<eos> We are just in the middle of work.<eos> Oh, uh, this might interest you.
I doff me hat to you, fair scallywag.<eos> We scurvy dogs must now bid ye farewell.<eos> Now you're down a bar.<eos> How does that help?<eos> Toby, quit your grab-ass.<eos> We need to focus.<eos> Okay, Cabe, remember when I helped you soup up that old Pontiac?<eos> Let me guess.<eos> We're gonna do that to this boat?<eos> I'll walk you through it.
Okay, start calculating the ballpark buoyancy force numbers for those materials, and throw in some floatation cushions and some pieces of life vests.<eos> Hold on, are you saying you can figure out where your friends are based on the scraps they used to build a raft?<eos> I'm saying if we figure out the general weight and buoyancy of those materials, we can plug those numbers into an algebraic function to predict how the current would have treated them, and then we can find the general area.<eos> Slow down.<eos> Say it all again, but not so many big words this time.<eos> I'm sorry, but you got to go.<eos> No, wait, this is a great story.<eos> It's not a story, it's my friends' lives.<eos> We haven't even gotten to the interview yet.<eos> I don't even have a single quote from you.
Congratulations.<eos> You got the endorsement and the votes and the election.<eos> I think you and Patty had very different takes on your meeting.<eos> It's an early edition of the paper.<eos> "West Altadenia Shopper endorses Sylvester Dodd."<eos> Really?<eos> That's the biggest upset since Ali/Foreman in '74.<eos> I have no idea who that is, but this is amazing news.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry I doubted you.
He needs the scratch.<eos> It's been a slow couple. Of months at his garage.<eos> Hey!<eos> Who's winning?<eos> Hi, sweetheart. Hey.<eos> How are you?<eos> Good.<eos> Cabe, you ready to go check out your lemans?<eos> Love them old pontiacs?<eos> Actually, I didn't ask you here.
Hey!<eos> Who's winning?<eos> Hi, sweetheart. Hey.<eos> How are you?<eos> Good.<eos> Cabe, you ready to go check out your lemans?<eos> Love them old pontiacs?<eos> Actually, I didn't ask you here.<eos> About the car. I...<eos> I need to talk to you about something else.
Love them old pontiacs?<eos> Actually, I didn't ask you here.<eos> About the car. I...<eos> I need to talk to you about something else.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Me either.<eos> What's going on, cabe?<eos> A few days ago, I got a call from the fbi.<eos> They arrested sonny dubin.<eos> They want me to convince you. To help them.
That's all you got to say in court.<eos> This dubin guy kills people, And you want my dad to take the stand against him?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> If he doesn't, The feds arrest him, they put the word out. That he's turning state's evidence.<eos> Dubin's guys can get to him in a lockup. A hell of a lot easier than they can. If he's on the street.<eos> God.<eos> But I worked out a deal.<eos> You cooperate, you get two years.<eos> Two years?<eos> They transfer you to a prison. Out of state.
But you have. To self-surrender by midnight tonight.<eos> You're ambushing him.<eos> I'm trying to help him.<eos> Patrick, If you don't cooperate, The feds will arrest you,<eos> If you run, the feds or dubin's guys will eventually find you.<eos> Testifying is your only option.<eos> Don't listen to him.<eos> He's not a genius.<eos> There are other options. That he can't figure out but I can.<eos> The feds put you in a bad spot?
Scorpion's booked on a flight. To sardovia leaving in two hours.<eos> But, agent gallo, we need you to sit this one out.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> If fake credentials are spotted, this all falls apart.<eos> So everyone goes in as themselves.<eos> Gallo's a federal agent.<eos> They'd never let him into the country.<eos> Understood.<eos> Have to go now.<eos> I'll see you at the tournament in 14 hours, Fill you in on the extraction plan then.

And one of you win your way into that tournament.
It's all about probabilities. After the first three moves, There's 121 million possible positions.<eos> Well, it's really a game of psychology, Anticipating your opponent's move before he knows himself.<eos> I see.<eos> Still a board game.<eos> You can call it whatever you want.<eos> But it's so intense sly has to wear a mouthguard. Because he grinds his teeth when he plays.<eos> Just wait. Till you see his victory dance.<eos> All right, I've heard enough.<eos> We got a woman's life at risk.<eos> Two of you will play in that tournament.
Copy that.<eos> I'll tell her.<eos> No.<eos> I'll tell her, because I will make it to the championship.<eos> Yeah, that's what's important right now.<eos> Look, everybody's headed into the competition room.<eos> You putzes go play; Paige and I'll.<eos> Figure out the natalya of it all.<eos> No comms.<eos> People see you.
Checkmate.<eos> Checkmate.<eos> Checkmate.<eos> Pleasure.<eos> Checkmate.<eos> Checkmate.<eos> Is this your first time playing?<eos> Checkmate.<eos> I'm stumped.<eos> I got three ways I can beat you, But I don't know which to use.
What are these?<eos> Keys to my garage and tow truck.<eos> If you could run the engine once in while. So it doesn't seize up, I'd appreciate it.<eos> Because you'll be locked up, or because you'll take my offer?<eos> Guys.<eos> You here for your prisoner?<eos> Patrick, we need to be there by midnight.<eos> Those were the terms.<eos> Yeah, I understand.<eos> And I hate to do this, But regulation says I need to cuff you. To bring you in.
- Yeah, the white bits.<eos> See, they're made from a plastic compound called unplasticised polyvinyl chloride, or uPVC for short.<eos> We've only just discovered that when exposed to sunlight, that type of plastic might explode.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - Oh, no, indeed.<eos> But it's not all bad news.<eos> Have you heard of Nasa?<eos> The space people?<eos> They're the ones.<eos> Now, as part of the space shuttle programme, they've developed a far superior plastic compound, one that won't kill you.
Oh, nom, nom, nom!<eos> Unlike Fitzpatrick, I don't need to use the dark arts to close a deal.<eos> ♪ Seen him hanging round my door. ♪<eos> (HE RINGS DOORBELL)<eos> Good morning, Mr Solomon.<eos> Vincent from Cachet Windows, we spoke on the phone earlier.<eos> Ah, Mr Vincent, yes.<eos> Look, I'm so sorry, but we're about to sit down for prayer.<eos> Maybe you can leave some brochures and we can phone you about prices tomorrow?<eos> Want to know the percentage of people who sleep on it and call you back?
My fate was sealed the very next day.<eos> I'm not a big believer in kismet, but you'd have to be blind, deaf and dumb as shit not to hear destiny calling me.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Oh, it's an elephant.<eos> It's not male genitalia.<eos> I'm looking for the owner.<eos> Oh, sorry, I'm new here.<eos> Right.<eos> Is the owner around?<eos> Like I said, I'm new, so I literally can't help you.
He just wandered in off the street.<eos> This is a fucking showroom!<eos> We want people to wander in off the street.<eos> Hello, sir.<eos> I take it this is your business?<eos> You've got two minutes, pal.<eos> For what?<eos> To sell me whatever the fuck it is you're selling, then fuck off.<eos> Meet Tony Walsh, the world's angriest small business owner.<eos> No, I don't want to sell TO you, I want to sell FOR you.
In another 45 seconds, they're going to walk out, along with thousands in lost revenue.<eos> I've got 20 quid that says Tweedledum and Tweedledee over there will still be scratching their arses when they walk out.<eos> Huh?<eos> All right, pal.<eos> Here's a price list.<eos> You sign them up, I'll give you a two-week trial.<eos> I hear congratulations are in order!<eos> Erm, sorry?<eos> The centennial customer award?<eos> Oh, wait, no-one told you?
My name's Vincent, nice to meet you.<eos> Hi, I'm Mark.<eos> This is my wife, Lorna.<eos> Hello.<eos> Wow, we've never won anything before.<eos> Well, I guess some people are born lucky, and the rest of us just have to make do with good looks and charm, eh?<eos> So, tell me, Mark, Lorna, why are you looking for new windows?<eos> Ten minutes of bullshit later, and I was ready to seal the deal.<eos> All of our products come with safety glass fitted as standard.<eos> Now, I'd imagine those little boys of yours are always keeping you on your toes, right, Lorna?
Yeah.<eos> Good, because while I've been standing here freezing my nuts off, I couldn't help thinking this conversation would have been much more comfortable in a beautiful double-glazed porch.<eos> You always did know how to make me laugh, Vincent Swan.<eos> Interesting place for a personalised number plate.<eos> I quite like it.<eos> Fancy a spin?<eos> Ooh, yeah.<eos> I've never been in a wanker-mobile before.<eos> I'll get me coat.<eos> Like I told you, page one of the training manual.
You get an expense account?<eos> We spend half our lives on the road, wining and dining clients, so the old company car and expense account comes in handy.<eos> Although it's not always easy getting a receipt from a knocking shop in Manchester, is it, Mart?<eos> No, it is not, Philip.<eos> But it did save me from having to fellate the client myself.<eos> Here you go, boyses.<eos> Winner.<eos> Winner.<eos> Winner.<eos> Nice meeting you, boyses.
So, what I was thinking was maybe you can replace the rest of the windows as well.<eos> To maintain the aesthetic.<eos> Right.<eos> And would you be looking to pay anything<eos> - for these windows, Ronnie?<eos> - What do you think?<eos> So, Maggie can expect someone round to measure up, what... on Monday?<eos> Monday.<eos> Monday's great.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you.
You've got to be shitting me.<eos> He'll probably be here in five minutes.<eos> Come in, wait inside.<eos> (PHONE RINGS)<eos> Pick up the phone, shitheads.<eos> - (PHONE RINGS)<eos> - He won't be long.<eos> No-one move, I'll get it.<eos> Cachet Windows and Doors.<eos> How may I help you?
Oh, sorry, I'm very suggestible.<eos> Look, I need you to calmly put the phone down and tell her I do not work there and you have never heard of me.<eos> I've never heard of Vincent Swan.<eos> So, why did you just invite me in and say he'd be along in five minutes?<eos> I thought you said...<eos> Winston...<eos> Ston.<eos> Winston Ston?<eos> Okay.<eos> Neither of you gentlemen would happen to be Vincent Swan?

Don't tell me?<eos> You liked our windows so much you're back for a free quote?<eos> Unfortunately, I'm here on official business, though you could sell me anything with those puppy dog eyes of yours.<eos> Any sign of your colleague Vincent Swan?<eos> I don't think I have a colleague called Vincent Swan.<eos> Nice, very good.<eos> The problem is our investigators have evidence that Mr Swan has been an employee of Cachet Windows for the last eight months.<eos> And yet no-one who works here seems to remember him.<eos> Isn't that strange... pretty face?<eos> That is strange but, like I said, I can't really help you...
All right, maybe we've all had about as much Vincent time as we can handle.<eos> Whoa!<eos> - Mum!<eos> - Right.<eos> Car.<eos> We're getting in the car this instant.<eos> - Right, your dad can do better than this.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> Run!<eos> What I really wanted to show you was this creation.
- Oh, hi.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> Your wife wasn't sure if you could make it.<eos> Wouldn't miss it for the world.<eos> In my day, it was always the naughty boys that sat at the back of the bus.<eos> Well, it still is, although it's not only the boys<eos> - that get up to no good.<eos> - Certainly not in my experience.<eos> Now, where would you like me, Miss Lyndsey?<eos> I think up front where I can keep my eye on you.
Right, Robbie, you're going to need to walk home on your own.<eos> What?<eos> I thought you were taking me?<eos> I gotta get back to work, mate.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I'll see ya.<eos> - See ya.<eos> Need a lift anywhere, Miss?<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> Can I let you into a secret?
Breaker breaker, this is the Widow Maker.<eos> I can't leave her.<eos> I'm all she's got.<eos> Man, that's rough.<eos> I feel terrible now, Brian.<eos> Can I give you a hand job at least, to say sorry?<eos> Jesus, Carol.<eos> No, you're all right.<eos> Now it was awkward and weird.<eos> To be perfectly honest with you, I'd actually forgotten he was married.
See you later, little prick.<eos> Vincent!<eos> Sometimes you gotta call a little prick a little prick.<eos> Do you want to go and join the others?<eos> I'll be over in a minute.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hi, Carol.<eos> Ah, Mr Mayor.<eos> Vincent Swan, Cachet Windows.<eos> Now I do hope Grandad hasn't been boring the tits off you...
I've got a meeting with Little Prick.<eos> I mean, Andrew Davis.<eos> Sorry, was that Andrew Davis?<eos> Yeah, Andrew Davis.<eos> - Come in.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Are you sure you should be here?<eos> I told you, Vincent and I had a little sit down, cleared the air.<eos> Now take a seat, Carol.<eos> In fact, Vincent practically begged me to come by and share with you my life-changing news.
What!<eos> I knew today was going to be boring.<eos> Listen, my number one son, you'll get to spend some quality time with Daddy, straight after Daddy gets back from closing a big fucking deal with the man from the council.<eos> Those Ataris don't grow on trees, you know.<eos> For the next hour, I'm going to forget my life's a shit-show and seal this fucking deal using the old Vincent Swan magic.<eos> First, I just might need some help from our old purple friends.<eos> It's show-time, folks!<eos> I've been waiting two fucking hours!<eos> Two fucking hours!<eos> I told you, Mr Swan, you haven't booked an appointment.
I've been waiting two fucking hours!<eos> Two fucking hours!<eos> I told you, Mr Swan, you haven't booked an appointment.<eos> Mr Osbourne is a busy man.<eos> - (DOOR OPENS)<eos> - Mr Swan?<eos> Rick Osbourne?<eos> Vincent Swan, Cachet Windows Head Of Commercial Sales.<eos> I'm Martin Lavender's boss.<eos> Sorry to barge in on you like this.
I told you, Mr Swan, you haven't booked an appointment.<eos> Mr Osbourne is a busy man.<eos> - (DOOR OPENS)<eos> - Mr Swan?<eos> Rick Osbourne?<eos> Vincent Swan, Cachet Windows Head Of Commercial Sales.<eos> I'm Martin Lavender's boss.<eos> Sorry to barge in on you like this.<eos> Really?<eos> Martin works for you?
Rick, I'll skip the foreplay and jump straight into the penetration then.<eos> We are very happy to be supplying windows to the old people's home but in order cut the lead-time we need to get the contract signed and the deposit paid.<eos> As I said, Mr Swan, talk to Sarah about an appointment.<eos> - There's no hurry.<eos> - No, no, no, there is a big fucking hurry indeed.<eos> Look, I have the contract here, so if you fancy signing it.<eos> Sorry, mate.<eos> Sweating like a pig.<eos> All right.<eos> I was dreading telling Martin this, but it's actually going to be a lot of fun telling you.
If you do get any more problems with the lights then I'll get<eos> - my boyfriend round.<eos> - What is he a priest?<eos> No, he's an electrician.<eos> - Have you got a tenner?<eos> - For what?<eos> The witch services.<eos> We're paying her for this?<eos> I can throw in a quick tarot reading as part of the price.<eos> I sense a troubled soul in you.
I sense a troubled soul in you.<eos> Tarot reading?<eos> No offence but if I want to appeal to a higher authority to get me out of this fucking hole, it'll be someone with more clout than a track-suit-wearing Grotbags.<eos> It looked like I was going to have to take this one to the very top.<eos> I guess I'm really doing this.<eos> Dear God,<eos> Jesus, Mary, whoever the fuck it is that deals with prayers, or let's call it what it is, begging requests.<eos> So this is it, I'm literally down on my knees.<eos> I mean, how does it even work?<eos> I promise to believe in you, adjust my behaviour accordingly, and you do what?
I had to bung that to Lavender after you made him finger you behind the bins.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, that all seems to be in order.<eos> Thank you, Mr Swan.<eos> I wish I could say the pleasure was all mine, but as you and I both know, it was mainly yours.<eos> Ciao.<eos> As it goes, paying tax felt better than I'd imagined.<eos> Probably helps that it was all Walshy's cash.<eos> Now time to make The Statue of Liberty reappear in my life, or as I like to call her, Sam.<eos> Millman Young. How may I help you?
After you.<eos> Is there any way you can stop the deposit from being taken?<eos> You see, my soon to be ex-husband isn't a well man, Philip.<eos> He's lost his marbles.<eos> I only show people around.<eos> I don't really have a say in that.<eos> Don't listen to her, Philip.<eos> Once she understands that I'm a changed man and I would never cheat on her again, we'll take it.<eos> That's his problem, you see, Philip.<eos> He doesn't understand how embarrassing this is for you or me.
Cost me a fucking fortune, that, son.<eos> Pull!<eos> Don't!<eos> Put it down, put it down, put it down.<eos> Fuck!<eos> - Oh, for fuck's sake.<eos> - Oh, look what you done now.<eos> I didn't do that.<eos> It's not my fault.<eos> Every so often karma can pop up and kick you in the bollocks, but the way I see it, you've got to break a few eggs to make an omelette.
Would he worry about taking them down with him, if things go bad for him?<eos> You're going to get him killed.<eos> You know that?<eos> You want something to do?<eos> Why don't you figure out who killed Frank Gaad in Bangkok and why instead of going after a guy who gave us the tip of the century and then went home to live his life?<eos> Sir.<eos> Sir.<eos> I'm going to ask for a meeting with the Deputy AG. I want him to stop this thing.<eos> You have a self-destructive streak, Agent Beeman.<eos> I'm telling you because I went behind my boss's back before--

Thank you for informing me.<eos> No, I'm telling you in case you want to be there.<eos> No, I do not want to be at your meeting with the Deputy AG, Agent Beeman.<eos> And for the record, I advised you to leave it alone.
- Kind of?<eos> - Well, no, yeah.<eos> Uh, you guys came over, right?<eos> I had the biggest crush on you.<eos> Oh, I can't blame you.<eos> Chilly.<eos> Hey, you guys hungry?<eos> I know a good burger joint on the way back.<eos> Thank you for agreeing to see me, sir.<eos> I'm always happy to make time for you, Agent Beeman.
You know how easy it is to go to jail in Soviet Union?<eos> I've heard.<eos> My father, he spent 15 years in prison camp.<eos> 15 years.<eos> For what?<eos> For murder? No.<eos> For stealing?<eos> No.<eos> Just for being alive.<eos> That's what they put you in prison for.
Back home, I ate garbage off the street most days.<eos> Other days, I never ate at all.<eos> My father died when I was six.<eos> In the war?<eos> No, after. But before... Before he died, there wasn't enough food.<eos> Not as bad as you, but... We went hungry a lot.<eos> Hello, Anatoli.<eos> We're from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<eos> In case you can't tell from our suits.<eos> We're sorry to disturb your lunch. We only want to talk to you for two or three minutes.
Shouldn't take more than a couple of hours.<eos> All this land out here. You know what it looks like?<eos> Home.<eos> We've got this, too.<eos> Why can't we grow enough grain ourselves?<eos> Alexei... some of what he says...<eos> Everybody has problems.<eos> Do you think they're gonna make me queen of the Rodeo this year?<eos> Mr. Pirogov. We're with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<eos> We wanted to talk with you about your work with Amtorg.
They just contracted us to breed Sitodiplosis Mosellana for them.<eos> How many pests have been delivered so far?<eos> We don't send the bugs. We... we send eggs.<eos> How many eggs?<eos> 30,000 to 40,000.<eos> I-It's not that many.<eos> It's... it's complicated.<eos> Do you know anything about bugs?<eos> Where are you sending them?<eos> I-I ca... I can tell you.
We didn't know.<eos> I told Tuan, um...<eos> Yeah, I got to get there.<eos> Pasha says his mother got the job.<eos> When does she start?<eos> Next week.<eos> Will you guys be here this weekend?<eos> No.<eos> Pasha will come by.<eos> It would be good for at least one of you to be here.
The Soviet Union has worked hard for peace.<eos> It has a lot of friends in a lot of organizations all around the world.<eos> Religious organizations? Well, some of them fight for justice, which is good enough for us.<eos> You have to wear it until he's gone.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Nyet.<eos> Mm.<eos> Hello.<eos> This is Gennadi.<eos> I know it would be better if I told you he comes before he comes.
I know it would be better if I told you he comes before he comes.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But is okay.

When we start to know each other, it was hard to wait.<eos> Well, we're very happy for you.

Weren't the expecting... the engagement.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Me too. I'm not yet used to it.<eos> But... it's... it's very good.<eos> He want to talk with you.
But there's a lot about life here that's not so great...<eos> You can't predict what a person's life will be.<eos> Does Paige know you're thinking about this?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> We will talk to her soon.<eos> We're just...<eos> The temptation is to put off making hard decisions, but then that becomes its own sort of decision.<eos> Paige and Henry are teenagers.<eos> At this age, the transition would be a very difficult one for them... but in a few years, it won't be your decision to make anymore.<eos> I wish I could tell you what you should do, but I don't know.
My name is Natalie Granholm. I was...<eos> I was Natalya Konina.<eos> You... you mistaken. Please.<eos> I swear.<eos> I-I-i don't know.<eos> I don't know this person, this Anna, whoever she is.<eos> Prokopchuk.<eos> Anna Mikhaylovna Prokopchuk.<eos> Who is she?<eos> What did she do to you?
I-i... it's not me. I swear it's not me.<eos> I am a wife, I'm a mother, I'm a grandmother.<eos> I lived in this house for twenty-five ye...<eos> You're a traitor!<eos> You betrayed your own people! No.<eos> Never.<eos> You slaughtered your own people.<eos> That's not true... Young boys...<eos> No. Soldiers...<eos> Brave men who were fighting, unlike you...
She's got great energy.<eos> And she's got it!<eos> She's not letting go!<eos> - She's not letting go!<eos> - Yeah, Shaun!<eos> - Oh, that feels good!<eos> You gotta jump hard!<eos> Everything you've got.<eos> - Go!<eos> - You know, that'll actually... - knock the wind out of you.
Previously on "Timeless"...<eos> I know a lot about you, Emma.
Previously on "Timeless"...<eos> I know a lot about you, Emma.<eos> You faked your own death, and hid in the past.<eos> You have no idea what you're up against.<eos> I have a pretty good idea.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I know things that Anthony doesn't know.<eos> Things that they have planned for that machine.<eos> You're helping Garcia Flynn?<eos> What does he have on you?
- Okay.<eos> She should be deplaning... now.<eos> It landed early.<eos> It says the plane arrived 20 minutes ago.<eos> - We missed her.<eos> - Wait, you didn't know that?<eos> No, Rufus, I didn't know that.<eos> Come on.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hi, do any of you happen to know Claire Gilliam?
Welcome.<eos> He's cute.<eos> What the hell was Wyatt thinking?<eos> - I get you're upset...<eos> - Upset doesn't touch how pissed I am.<eos> I'm fielding calls from the President, for God's sake.<eos> And Rufus was a hostage?<eos> My ass.<eos> He was in on it, and so were you, by the way.<eos> The minute that Wyatt told me what he was doing, I called you.
My ass.<eos> He was in on it, and so were you, by the way.<eos> The minute that Wyatt told me what he was doing, I called you.<eos> 24 minutes after he left, actually.<eos> So you're spying on me now?<eos> I put a car on your house for your protection, you're welcome.<eos> This is about Wyatt's wife, isn't it?<eos> I knew he was fixated on her murder, but this is just so reckless.<eos> Can you blame him?<eos> I mean how is he supposed to let Jessica go when, thanks to you, everyday, he has to come to work and stare at a damn machine that can go back in time and bring his wife back to life?

He's not available.<eos> Well, make him available.<eos> I'm not sure how to respond to that.<eos> Jiya, who's on the phone?<eos> Anthony Bruhl's on the line.<eos> He says he'll only talk to Lucy.<eos> That's ridiculous, I'm gonna speak to him.<eos> - No, you won't.<eos> - What... why? Why me?<eos> I don't know, but he asked for you, just keep him talking.
- No, you won't.<eos> - What... why? Why me?<eos> I don't know, but he asked for you, just keep him talking.<eos> No, no, no, no... that's... I...<eos> Hello?<eos> This is Lucy Preston.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Rufus took out the Lifeboat, didn't he?<eos> That's got to be the only reason he's not picking up his half dozen devices.<eos> Why would Rufus want to talk to you after everything that you've done to help Flynn?
You're... you're in San Francisco?<eos> Come alone.<eos> Leave your phone.<eos> No technology.<eos> I'll know if you're wired.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Why me?<eos> Besides Rufus, you're the only one that'll understand.<eos> Understand what?<eos> Give me one good reason why I should trust you.
Two rum and Cokes, one with a lemon.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Hey. - Sorry.<eos> - Ma'am.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Did you just call me "ma'am"?<eos> - Hey, bartender!<eos> I'm sorry, ma'am, that's just a force of habit.<eos> From what?<eos> Well, look, in the Special Forces, they teach you to be polite.
Well, it can't be that bad.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Okay, it's cool.<eos> - Yeah. - Thank you.<eos> Well, I think I should accompany Lucy to meet Bruhl.<eos> He and I have worked together for over a decade.<eos> We're mates.<eos> He trusts me.<eos> Yet he didn't ask for you.
Right, 'cause if he does, they'll bang and conceive a serial killer, got it.<eos> That is not a sentence you say every day.<eos> Bartender?<eos> Can I have a... banana daiquiri?<eos> I got to get the blender.<eos> It's a whole thing.<eos> Kind of had my heart set on it.<eos> All right.<eos> Let me get the Curacao.<eos> I just wanted to tell you, you were great back there with that cop.
- Where is it?<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> I don't know... I don't know what you're talk...<eos> Where's the signal?<eos> Get it back.<eos> - I'm trying.<eos> - Jiya, try it.<eos> - I just want to talk.<eos> - Want to talk about what, okay?<eos> I came to you 'cause you said that you had a way to end all of this.
- Want to talk about what, okay?<eos> I came to you 'cause you said that you had a way to end all of this.<eos> And I do. I just need your help first.<eos> She's back.<eos> She's headed west, west on 16th.<eos> Stop there.<eos> Against the wall.<eos> Okay... Easy, easy, easy, easy.<eos> Rufus is gone.<eos> So I guess I got to trust you.
- No, the other right. - Okay, okay.<eos> Grab it.<eos> You're actually really good at this.<eos> It's all about the reflexes, ma'am.<eos> Claire.<eos> Right?<eos> Hi, yeah, you were on the flight.<eos> You remember.<eos> 7D.<eos> Almost did recognize you out of uniform.
I just saw Lucy downstairs.<eos> She's as skittish as a cat.<eos> How did it go with Bruhl?<eos> - Did they have a nice chat?<eos> - Sorry, Mr. Mason.<eos> - National security and all that.<eos> - Yes, well, obviously.<eos> That's why I'm asking you.<eos> What did Bruhl have to say to her?<eos> I'm not playing games with you today, I'm not in the mood.
- Flynn?<eos> - Most likely discovered<eos> - he was trying to...<eos> - Do the right thing.<eos> What'd you tell his family?<eos> That he died in an accident serving his country.<eos> It's good.<eos> Come in.<eos> Look, I know exactly who you are, and I know you know exactly who I am, and it's probably a huge mistake coming over here, but I thought that maybe even you wouldn't hurt your own daughter.<eos> And I just wanted to tell you face to face... that I know.
I'm glad you're here.<eos> It's a relief, honestly.<eos> A relief?<eos> Having to watch you from afar, never being able to speak to... to my own daughter. It's been... hasn't been easy.<eos> And you... you're smart, you're beautiful, you're incredib...<eos> I could care less what you think about me.<eos> What you are a part of is inhuman.<eos> - Rittenhouse?<eos> - Rittenhouse.<eos> Well, I've got news for you, my dear, you're a part of it, too.
I always like to tell audiences... pre-program, just in case you're brought here by a friend.<eos> Sometimes friends lead us astray.<eos> I had two very close friends.<eos> My parents invite me to go see a film.<eos> I said, "Of course I'll go see that movie with you", because you love me.
I asked a similarly desperate question for many years, which was, how do you make it in show business?<eos> Do you move to San Diego and disguise yourself as a bush?<eos> Moving slowly northward beneath the cover of dusk?<eos> And what do famous people always say?<eos> They always say, "Well, do you enjoy doing it?"<eos> Great.<eos> Good.<eos> Isn't it fun, yeah, just keep doing it.<eos> Just keep it doing, you know, and, um... if you don't enjoy it, please, you know, stop.<eos> But no one can ever take that away from you.
Well, Princess Daffodil, that would be the whole fucking thing, so why don't you learn to project above nine television sets and make some friends?<eos> And if you're lucky in life, you get to have those dark times, the relationship equivalent of two weeks in Laughlin, Nevada.<eos> Bombing three shows a night for hundreds of silent, angry jet skiers.<eos> Laughing, crying, thinking, this is not at all what I wanted!<eos> But there's always one strawberry toaster pastry left in the hallway vending machine.<eos> And you break it, and share it with the opener and the headliner.<eos> And you make it through another show.<eos> And that way you get days like today, where it all seems like it was meant to be.<eos> Happy anniversary to show business audience of over 20 years.<eos> I love you all far more deeply than the day we first met, and the fact that we all still have the free will to abandon each other at any given moment... makes it all the more compelling.
Not a lot of comics who are doing that.<eos> You're right.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm 46 years-old.<eos> Of course I've fallen in love many times before.<eos> It was always over 100% my fault, uh, that it didn't work out, 'cause you know how it is.<eos> You fall in love with someone. You tell them, uh, that you love them, and then you share with them what you think is the single most horrifying fact about yourself.<eos> They're gonna think it's something else.<eos> But...<eos> For example, I would tell you, I love you so much.
That's about the most romantic thing I ever did hear tell!<eos> Merch!<eos> Merch!<eos> Anybody?<eos> Hi.<eos> Uh, you interested in some merch?<eos> Uh, we take, uh, cash, we take credit cards.<eos> We, uh, take barter.<eos> Um, that's a safe dating card.<eos> It takes you through the stages of dating, all the way through rape and domestic violence.
We, uh, take barter.<eos> Um, that's a safe dating card.<eos> It takes you through the stages of dating, all the way through rape and domestic violence.<eos> You don't have any CDs or anything?<eos> Uh, I do not sell any CDs of my stand-up comedy.<eos> I know... I bought this already, because it's my own merch, but wouldn't I be interested in having a little more?<eos> 'Cause what if I gave this one away?<eos> The signature, I'm hiding hat.<eos> And then I would need another.<eos> These are perfect for the athletic in you.
Jesus Christ!<eos> Um, this is an XXL.<eos> You think, that would be too big on me, but is it not just maybe perfect?<eos> The perfect size.<eos> If you want a conversation starter, you know, and you say, okay, I wanna wear a big short that's gonna make people ask questions, but then also acknowledge my limitations as a personality, so that, when you abruptly walk away,<eos> look down, they're not surprised.<eos> "Oh, do you wanna be happy?" "Yes."<eos> "Do you wanna be a success?" "Yes."<eos> "Do you wanna buy merch?" "Yes!"<eos> I just tricked you there.
Were you not listening when I just mentioned that I am raccoon?<eos> I can digest ceiling tile.<eos> I just need to fill this up, get back to the river with my friends.<eos> Did you just bring an old salad to bed?<eos> It's nighttime, I'm awake!<eos> We do not know what we're doing, uh, so we go see a therapist, and we don't know if it's helping, but we have written a song about her.<eos> ♪ Cheryl Hirsham ♪ ♪ Cheryl Cheryl Hirsham Hirsham ♪<eos> ♪ Cheryl Hirsham Hirsham ♪<eos> ♪ You go to Cheryl Hirsham ♪<eos> ♪ 'Cause she reflects back what your partner's trying to say to you ♪
Do you wanna go to a fitness boot camp?<eos> It's every day at 6:00 a.m. 'cause they're making us into a shape, and you run and there's no game element to distract you from the fact that you keep running and running.<eos> Here's what I'm gonna do.<eos> I'm gonna go for five days.<eos> Day five, Tanya, and I know it's gonna be Tanya, is gonna say, "Come on, Maria!<eos> I wanna see you push it!"<eos> And I am never gonna go again.<eos> But will you forget to cancel the automatic debit coming from your checking account and pay for it for the next year and a half?<eos> Of course I will.<eos> I love you so much.
We will sit, and we will stay, which is not a problem for our family, because, uh, everyone's brought in a wagon.<eos> We've got two elderly, overweight pugs.<eos> Nobody walks.<eos> Uh, just out to get some air.<eos> And, you know, Howard's trying to get me to teach the dogs something.<eos> You gotta give them consequences.<eos> Howard, we're keeping them alive.<eos> Is that not cruelty enough?<eos> Well, you know, if I asked you, hey, would you raise your right hand for me, you'd say, fuck you, Howard.<eos> I don't know you.

I am aggressively optimistic.<eos> I was, um,<eos> Talking to a lady in a shop, and she said, "I've always wanted to open a little boutique like this, but just like a gourmet deli!"<eos> Dude, it's already started happening.<eos> You just, you say, "I am now a grocer."<eos> I am now purveying cookies, candies, cakes, cornucopias.<eos> "I am now."<eos> Yeah, I have two kids, a full-time job.<eos> That'd be pretty tough.<eos> I know it seems impossible, but it is insane how much the universe supports you!
I have also been audited by the IRS five times!<eos> Turns out they owed me $25!<eos> 'Cause I may be eccentric, but I save my receipts in a bucket.<eos> And, um... the reason I say that, uh, I'm a bookkeeper is because one time I was on a flight from Los Angeles to New York, and a woman said, what do you do, what I did.<eos> And she went into a PTSD stream of consciousness traumatic monologue about the worst experience I've... The night... when my husband, we were in the front row of a comedy show, and the comedian, it was an hour and no, no laughs.<eos> He was bombing, and, you know what? We couldn't leave.<eos> And it was so painful.<eos> It was... weird and... I will never go see stand-up comedy ever.<eos> Well, we apologize that you experienced that with our services.<eos> If there's any way we can win back your business, in fact, I'd love to get your e-mail address and your birthday and set you up with 20 free tickets to a comedy show!
Felt... so relieved.<eos> And he went back to his little laptop, um, and some music came out of it, and I was like, well that's kind of weird.<eos> Uh, but I get it, uh...<eos> A lot of times, in the light booth right now actually I have a little, uh, Wimp video playing a baby tortoise trying to eat a raspberry.<eos> And it's just so, when at work when I get bored,<eos> I have something to cheer me up.<eos> It doesn't affect my performance at all.<eos> He turned the laptop around, and he said, is this you?<eos> And I said, yes, clearly it's me, with more make-up and better material.<eos> And, uh... he said, "I had to YouTube you" because I was concerned that you were delusional."
"Tell them you are gold medallion!"<eos> I did what my mother told me, and it turns out, uh, points is not a bad form of health-care.<eos> Got an upgrade.<eos> I was bleeding and crying, but a lot of leg room.<eos> Merch for sale.<eos> Mer... Merch for...<eos> Merch for sale!<eos> Hi, guys.<eos> Selling, um, some items.<eos> I don't want to force you into anything.
I don't want to force you into anything.<eos> Whatever's within your budget.<eos> All the money goes, uh, to support uh, the psychiatric hospital that is in my hometown, Miller-Dwan.<eos> My mom's stayed there and worked there.<eos> And this is a pencil that has hope on this side.<eos> There's the words "Hope"<eos> so you can grind down "Hope", very slowly.<eos> And at the bottom it says,<eos> "More merch available."<eos> Look at that, that looks perfect on you.
"More merch available."<eos> Look at that, that looks perfect on you.<eos> - It works.<eos> - You know what? It's...<eos> Everything's free.<eos> Everything's free.<eos> I can't, I can't charge these people.<eos> Just take it, take it, take it.<eos> It's-it's all yours.<eos> And thank you for coming to the show.
I had a dream come true, uh, which I-I couldn't believe it.<eos> Show business came to my hometown of Duluth, Minnesota and said the kinds of things that show business does, things like, "This is amazing."<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's like a little San Francisco here.<eos> It's like a freshwater Monaco.<eos> Why have I never heard of this Duluth, Minnesota?<eos> We definitely have to shoot here.<eos> We want to use local talent, all local catering.<eos> Let's start getting lists of people who may be interested in acting in a television series in the area.<eos> "We'll see you next month."
Let's start getting lists of people who may be interested in acting in a television series in the area.<eos> "We'll see you next month."<eos> And then what happened... is nothing.<eos> And, uh... I was left...<eos> I told my mom, and she was, "Honey, but they came to supper twice," and they said that I was very talented and your father had a gift, and that...<eos> Oh, Mother.<eos> We just need to go to each person and tell them they've actually had one of the most authentic show business experiences... you can have.<eos> Which... is being given the full ghost.<eos> Don't know what ghosting is?<eos> That's when someone declares their undying love for you, and then disappears off the face of the Earth.
I have to say it, I used to look down on people with hobbies.<eos> And, uh... I was like,<eos> "What are you doing over there for no money?"<eos> You getting any cash on the back end of this hiking deal?<eos> "This walk to nowhere?"<eos> And then I looked down at what I was always doing very happily for fun and for free.<eos> I was always filling out a self-help manual of some kind.<eos> I have not changed discernibly in 25 years, which means I've been playing a very long, super fun game of emotional Sudoku.<eos> My husband and I got a board going at home.<eos> Your great-grandfather was a violent alcoholic who was in the army who beat his son, who was a violent alcoholic in the army who beat his son, who was a violent alcoholic in the marines who beat you.
I had nothing to do with it.<eos> They had a horrible childhood.<eos> I'm amazed that they even survived.<eos> Well, you know, Linda, You know, the thing, kid, the thing, yeah.<eos> I... When... I...<eos> You never worked a day in your life, Marilyn.<eos> I worked for 40 years as a nurse.<eos> I stood over men's deathbeds as they begged for hand jobs with their dying breath.<eos> She actually says "Blowjobs", but please don't say that because it's my mother.<eos> Well, I gotta tell you, once you give Maria a detail, you know?
Sorry. Fine.<eos> So, it's rude.<eos> This is more one-woman show territory.<eos> Apologies, apologies.<eos> Okay, this is the scariest part of the show.<eos> I'm trying to believe in something, and, uh... I can't, there's something more, more bigger than myself, and I just, I just can't, I can't think of anything.<eos> And, um...<eos> But then I remember there's this game that we used to play when we were kids, and it's called One Big Blob.<eos> What happens: I'm it, you run away from me, frightened, afraid.<eos> I begin running after you, while chanting, one big blob!

I lost everything because of something you did, and you're here at 3:00 a.m. asking me for a favor?<eos> Really?<eos> You're a mean person, Richard.<eos> Do you know that? You are a bad guy. No.<eos> No, no, no. I wouldn't say that.<eos> I think, maybe, what's happening is that you're just not understanding the technology I'm trying to build here.<eos> Oh, so now I'm stupid, too?<eos> I know what the technology is, Richard.<eos> I have a patent on it.<eos> What the fuck is a matter with you?
Wow, Dinesh, this front-end design looks great.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Nice work.<eos> What's in that?<eos> That is a burrito for the test.<eos> - Good to know. - Oh.<eos> Let him have it.<eos> Gilfoyle thought he was too good to work on SeeFood, and now he's about to lose a fortune.<eos> Ready for test.<eos> After you, milady.
Here I am.<eos> Class of '06.<eos> - Go Cardinal.<eos> - Go Cardinal.<eos> Anyways, we founded our own Shazam-for-food company, - and he's funding us.<eos> Whoa, congrats!<eos> Wait, that's stealing. No.<eos> It's exactly what Mark Zuckerberg did to the Winkle guy in that Facebook movie Professor Bighetti had us watch.<eos> And he was the hero of that film.<eos> And with all of us working together, we'll easily beat you to market.

This is where it all began, gentlemen.<eos> The birthplace of Hooli. Peter Gregory's mother's garage.<eos> That was Peter's workstation.<eos> This was mine.<eos> Things sure have changed.<eos> But in a way, they've stayed exactly the same.<eos> As we forge our new path together, we must remain focused on what's really important...<eos> Not material success or wealth, but this, the spirit of innovation...<eos> A few coders, some ramen, and a dream.<eos> And that is why I brought you here.
Tech is reserved for people like me. Okay?<eos> The freaks, the weirdos, the misfits, the geeks, the dweebs, the dorks!<eos> Not you.<eos> Oh, and your days of leeching off Gavin Belson are over.<eos> Game over, blood boy.<eos> You fuckin' nerd.<eos> Look.<eos> I know you've been unhappy with me lately.<eos> Correct. Look.<eos> I'm asking you to trust me on something.

Look.<eos> I'm asking you to trust me on something.<eos> Ed Chen has been making moves behind your back with the other partners to try and force you out of Raviga.
However, I have countervailed it with my...<eos> Your fourth child?<eos> As I was saying...<eos> I have spoken to our top IPs and lined up enough of them in order to leave Raviga and start a new firm.<eos> It struck me as a opportune time to jump ship.<eos> Holy shit! You're a fuckin' ninja.<eos> Even though your disclosure just now had absolutely no actionable value, it did reveal tremendous loyalty, so... all is well now.<eos> So, you're not mad at me anymore?<eos> No, Monica.<eos> I am a human being, just like you, like Ed Chen... and this.
But didn't he sign an NDA with you?<eos> I mean, can't you sue him?<eos> That would only prove everything he's saying is true and make it worse.<eos> Speaking of, I had my blood tested this morning.<eos> My cholesterol is through the roof.<eos> At this rate, I'll be dead by the age of 120.<eos> That...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Richard, I'm sorry.<eos> I told you that a big public rollout of our product would be good for the company.
And yet, I sat here taking business advice from him.<eos> A fucking blood boy.<eos> Just look at me.<eos> I'm a fraud, and everyone knows it.<eos> And when I fell, not one person stood up for me.<eos> What does that say?<eos> I just think it's all over for me now.<eos> No, it's...<eos> It's not over.<eos> Look... I chose to partner with you. That...
That's very impressive, all of it, but you guys have to understand that companies like ours are particularly risk averse.<eos> Is it a slight Idaho accent, Liz?<eos> It's Montana, actually.<eos> Even better.<eos> The big blue sky state. Yeah.<eos> Well, I knew you had to have come from above.<eos> Well, speaking of heaven, that's probably where you'll think you are when you start saving 25 percent on your data storage.<eos> Get an upgrade from there. Liz, you have beautiful skin.<eos> - Um, thank... thank you. - You, yeah.<eos> Both of you.
We're getting this deal because of the tech.<eos> I'm not letting you fuck this up, okay?<eos> I know you're looking for something to do, but this is not it.<eos> What do you mean, I'm looking for something to do?<eos> You're lucky that you've garnished this much of my time.<eos> I have plenty to do! Tons of lots of things!<eos> I have a thriving incubator.<eos> It is thriving.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> Fuck you, guys.
It's just for the past few hours, you've been a little, um... checked out.<eos> I'm just... thinking.<eos> So, you're getting cold feet?<eos> What?<eos> It's okay. I know what you're dealing with.<eos> I don't think you do.<eos> I do. Trust me, I do.<eos> Okay, I bet someone in your position has been told many times to look before you leap.<eos> But, Liz... what about right now you just...<eos> And, look, I'm gonna go out on a limb here, but I'm gonna go ahead and say that I'll bet there's a piece of you deep down inside that... knows this is a good idea.
I win! I win.<eos> I win!<eos> Shut up, Jared.<eos> Last night...<eos> Last night was...<eos> Bad.<eos> Bad. Yeah, oh my God.<eos> It was bad, right? It was such a bad thing to have done.<eos> The worst sex I think I've ever had... by far.<eos> Oh, s... it... so it was bad for you... too.
So...<eos> Okay. So, I will come back and get my stuff when you're gone.<eos> No, I'm just gonna... the door.<eos> To... I was born to roam, anyways.<eos> Richard.<eos> Liz just told me.<eos> She did?<eos> And... if it's fine with her, then I guess the deal is fine with me, so... it's approved.<eos> Good.<eos> I'll ride down with you.
- Worse.<eos> It's cold outside.<eos> - Okay. So?<eos> California looses its mind when it gets cold.<eos> Citrus trees start freezing.<eos> Sometimes there's actual frost on the road, you know, then people start filing claims like crazy.<eos> Our whole office is going nuts right now.<eos> Well, that kind of data traffic is costing us a fortune.<eos> That's the beauty of the deal we made, Richard. You agreed to store our data for a flat rate.<eos> Everyone else in my division is getting gouged on their storage and bandwidth fees right now, but thanks to you, I look like a genius.
Nothing.<eos> Just that... he's considered the greatest showman the tech world has ever seen.<eos> I mean, just look at him.<eos> We've blown away the FIPS 140-2 standard for security, and that's been certified by NIST/CSE, as you can see...<eos> - there.<eos> Look at the confidence, the poise. Look at the stage presence.<eos> is accessible... here we go... through the drop-down menu...<eos> - How could I top that?<eos> Oh, I don't think anyone ever will.<eos> When he looked at you, you felt like you were - the only two people in the world.
- Yeah, you did.<eos> You know you did.<eos> You made me feel bad.<eos> I like to feel good.<eos> Why would you do that to me?<eos> Seriously?<eos> You fucked us, Keenan.<eos> Richard was gonna take that deal, and then you pulled it right out from under us.<eos> You cost me, personally, a shit-ton of money.<eos> Is that what Richard told you?
We have to try. Okay, I'm going to put this in your backpack.<eos> - Oh no.<eos> - No, it's fine.<eos> - I don't want it. I don't want it. - Dinesh, it's fine.<eos> And you, you're gonna hold this kill switch, and then you're gonna walk into the most densely populated area you can find.<eos> If you see the security coming, remember, you press that button and, poof, you're gone. Yeah? Okay.<eos> I'll get as many of those motherfuckers as I can.<eos> We'll be rewarded in the end.<eos> When the fuck were you gonna tell us?<eos> - Tell you what?
- our undoing!<eos> - Hey, come on. Calm down now.<eos> PoopFare!<eos> You reckless child.<eos> Gentlemen. Come with me, please.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> Richard Hendricks.<eos> Sorry, do I know you?<eos> No... but I know all about you.
Gentlemen. Come with me, please.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> Richard Hendricks.<eos> Sorry, do I know you?<eos> No... but I know all about you.<eos> These Wi-Fi Pineapples... are they yours?<eos> And this image from the security footage?<eos> Smell anything?<eos> These two individuals look familiar to you?
What the hell are these gentlemen doing in my office?<eos> We caught them with Pineapples.<eos> You mean the Pineapples that I hired them to bring to the conference as part of a covert penetration test of our Wi-Fi security?<eos> - Sorry, we didn't know.<eos> - You weren't supposed to.<eos> Now, give these gentlemen their passes and equipment back and get them back on the floor.<eos> You know, you said some very nice things about Gavin Belson in that interview.<eos> You could've very easily kicked a good man when he was down.<eos> Good luck with whatever it is you're doing.<eos> I'd walk you down myself, but for reasons I really can't get into... I'm not allowed to leave this room.
I told them that we would meet them at Barker's keynote, so... come on.<eos> Richard, the fact that you think that success justifies all your behavior...<eos> We were in crisis mode, okay?<eos> And yeah, I lost my head, but crisis averted, so it's time to reinstate habeas corpus, huh?<eos> What about the next crisis, Richard?<eos> Jared, this won't happen again. I swear.<eos> So, let's just enjoy it... for a minute.<eos> Please.<eos> Come on, give it up! I love this company!<eos> And how about you?
What the fuck was that?<eos> You fired him?<eos> He already quit, remember?<eos> Besides, he was being a fucking asshole.<eos> Jared was being an asshole?<eos> Do you want to go with him?<eos> Because, if you haven't noticed, if we don't get this shit to Standford and all set up by 9:00 a.m., we are fucked!<eos> Okay, listen up, everybody, here's the deal.<eos> I was just talking to your foreman, Jung-Sho... and he seems to feel that you are all working at maximum capacity and that you cannot work any harder.<eos> But I have just flown from America, and I'm here to prove to you that he is wrong.
Now's not really a great time, Richard.<eos> I'm sort of in the middle of something.<eos> Wait. You said you already explained.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I did. Yeah, it's just...<eos> Come on, buddy, I need you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Be right there.<eos> Can I go to the bathroom?<eos> We don't want to inconvenience you.
We're-we're-we're... we're so... We... we got it. We're here.<eos> W-we did it.<eos> You... hypocrites.<eos> You fucking hypocrites.<eos> When I wouldn't use the fake users, you called me a pussy. When I wouldn't lie on the stand, you called me a pussy.<eos> But now, when I'm actually doing what you've been wanting me to do, you quit?<eos> You're the pussies. You are the pussies.<eos> I'm the only one that's trying to fucking... save what we do here!<eos> All this time we spent building this thing, and now, now it falls apart because you two don't fucking do it?<eos> - This is too much for you?
Well, I'll leave you alone now.<eos> Hey. "This guy fucks."<eos> - What's this?<eos> - It's a job application.<eos> I'd like to submit myself for a position with Pied Piper.<eos> I'd really like to be there till the bitter end.<eos> "Lordy, Lordy, looks who's 40."<eos> That's the wrong one.<eos> I gotta say, Gavin... when that storeroom door opened, and I saw your face grinning down at me, I thought it was an angel.<eos> When we get home, I'm going to do everything in my power to get you back in the good graces of the Hooli board.

I can use a fellow of your talents, sir.<eos> That's very gracious of you, Jack.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Welcome aboard, gentlemen.<eos> Our flying time to Mountain View is 11 hours and 36 minutes, and we will be stopping off in Jackson Hole first.<eos> Stopping off at Jackson Hole, are you, Gavin?<eos> No, Jack. You are.<eos> Jackson Hole is definitively out of the way.<eos> Everyone knows that.<eos> But I don't mind dropping you off first, this one last time.
I hear you're swimming in funding offers.<eos> A few.<eos> I think we're gonna go with Bream-Hall.<eos> - They seem to get us.<eos> - You haven't seen all the offers yet.<eos> Richard, we were partners once.<eos> I'd like to do it again.<eos> This is an acquisition offer, and it will make you a very wealthy man.<eos> Let's do this together.<eos> That's very kind of you.
This is what magic is for.<eos> - Boldly spoken for a student who lacked the balls to control a flea.<eos> - Look, I survived your abuse, and I got off my ass, and I went into the goddamn world.<eos> What have you done?<eos> You... You've sat around and drank.<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> - No, fuck you.<eos> Do you know why Alice went to Brakebills?<eos> To find out what happened to her brother.<eos> What happened was his friend Emily had the bad sense to fall in love with you, and it destroyed her.
My pregnant wife is locked up in fairy Gitmo.<eos> I'm betrothed to a rat.<eos> My pinot noir grapes are nearly ripe.<eos> My adventure's just begun, so why else would Ember banish me?<eos> Because I'm a fuck up. That's it.<eos> So the button.<eos> Gimme.<eos> - Uh, about that, um, we kind of bargained it away to a dragon in exchange for tickets to the underworld.<eos> - You gave our only means of traveling to Fillory to fucking Trogdor?<eos> - Both the high king and queen have vanished, leaving you the only child of earth in Fillory.
- On to business, then.<eos> Half the court are still rats.<eos> The talking beavers are in revolt.<eos> They're demanding dental coverage.<eos> - And the measly mountains, they've disappeared.<eos> Completely just...<eos> Stop!<eos> The thrones are cursed.<eos> - Okay, is anything not fucked?<eos> - Your high kingliness, perhaps this is all too much for you.
The thing is, I think I kind of need you too right now.<eos> There's something you need to know.<eos> - Does Reynard know that you're here?<eos> - No.<eos> - Okay, that's good.<eos> It's important that we keep up appearances. - I've seen what he can do when he's angry.<eos> - John, tell her what you told me about our lady underground.<eos> - Reynard's obsessed with her.<eos> I think they were lovers, but she left him.<eos> Everything that he's done to her followers, to you...
And you would waste so much of what you really are.<eos> - If you think doing this is going to turn me into you, you don't understand people at all.<eos> - I've been at it a long time.<eos> Well, look at Julia.<eos> I put a tiny black spot on her soul, and she scrubbed at it so much she put a hole in it.<eos> She can never go back to who she is.<eos> Now... Neither can you.<eos> This is an investment in our future, son.<eos> Someday, when you've embraced what you really are, you'll come find me.<eos> - Can I help you?
- I... I need a drink.<eos> - How was spell practice?<eos> - I can barely make a spark.<eos> - I thought you said it'd be easy.<eos> - You know, no pressure or anything...<eos> - do you ever think about where you'd be if he hadn't...<eos> - raped me?<eos> No, I try to focus on who I was.<eos> It's getting harder, though.<eos> - Reynard thinks he broke you, that there's no coming back from what he did.
I read it.<eos> Leaving me is the only way you have a chance.<eos> - Penny.<eos> - I got your book.<eos> - What the hell? Penny?<eos> Oh, my...<eos> Help!<eos> - Give me good news, Rafe.<eos> - Unfortunately, returning from the fairy realm is, uh, problematic.<eos> All I have is this tincture that takes you there.
And we're gonna help them get it and then catch them in the act.<eos> It's the only way to be sure of stopping them.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You bet.<eos> Do you know what you did back there, Will?<eos> You just painted a big, fat target on your back.<eos> The people these terrorists have hunted, well, they're a vicious lot.<eos> They could take out everyone in a locked room as if they were never there, and you've just said,<eos> "Hello, mates.<eos> I'm the only thing standing between you and freedom."
It's good to be back, Dad.<eos> Owen doesn't know it, but he's just given us exactly what we need...<eos> Access to the NSA.<eos> So, Lydia will be playing assist today on your op inside the NSA.<eos> I'll be at my father's side, keeping him busy, while you execute your mission.<eos> Your objective... to remove your digital footprint.<eos> Our objective...<eos> To tap the NSA.<eos> Every e-mail and call you've made at The Farm has likely been intercepted and recorded by an NSA listening post.<eos> Send an e-mail that might compromise you later or made a phone call that could tip off a foreign power.
You seeing the assistant director?<eos> Just an interview on the background for my book on the Grand Central crisis.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm such a klutz.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, this will get you up in his office.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Selfie before you go?<eos> It's for my husband.<eos> He's really into you.
You completed the op.<eos> Your SIGINT is but a memory to the NSA.<eos> The NSA, National Security Agency, you beat them.<eos> You won.<eos> So take some pride in the fact that you're all one step closer to being ghosts.<eos> What we do here is more than just locks and scanners and passwords.<eos> It's about people.<eos> So if you can't make people look the other way, you don't deserve to be here, but if you can misdirect someone for just a second, the right second, then you can commit an act of treason.<eos> That's exactly what you did today.<eos> Remember that line I told you about when you first started training here?
Well, he had nothing but me.<eos> And that lasted about three months, and then he was gone.<eos> I tried to see him.<eos> But I couldn't find him.<eos> His family wouldn't talk to me.<eos> I reached out to his sister, who tried, but they got to her, too, and he stopped returning my calls.<eos> So I stopped calling.<eos> A year goes by.<eos> In the mail, a wedding invitation.<eos> "Sir Laurence Bishop invites you to attend the wedding of his son."
I warned you when we met. - Beth, we look alike, that's it.<eos> This other C-word business, I-I-I don't even know what to say about it.<eos> It's hokum.<eos> - Uh... Yeah. Great!<eos> All sold. Raffle tickets sold!<eos> Bye. You have been phone-fussing all night.<eos> Have you got something going on the side?<eos> What?<eos> Ahem!<eos> So, guys, uhhh, Aynsley and I have a little proposition for the two of you.
Tell Rachel when you found me, I was looking for Helena.<eos> No, tell Rachel that Helena's not gonna let her suck stem cells out of her babies!<eos> Not exactly a scientist, are you, Mrs. Hendrix.<eos> I studied kinesiology.<eos> Cosima is a real scientist and a very valuable one.<eos> Sarah and Helena are fertile, biologically priceless.<eos> - And then there's you.<eos> - I'm a mother - and a homemaker.<eos> - As you go back today to your vapid existence, I want you to consider your worth.<eos> Because even M.K. had more value than you.
♪ So far away ♪ Alison, what are you doing here?<eos> I'm loving my neighbours, Eileen, and try not to judge.<eos> And we all miss her.<eos> Hi, Chad.<eos> Hi, Jake.<eos> Hi, Esme. We... we... Pff, I haven't seen you since...<eos> - The funeral, yeah.<eos> - Right.<eos> Right. I'm-I'm so sorry, guys.<eos> I... We miss you on Black Oak Drive.
Ramone!<eos> - You, you ripped us off!<eos> - Mrs. Hendrix?<eos> Kellerman fronted us those pills and you left us holding the bag!<eos> That's not true.<eos> That product was - bought and paid for.<eos> Aaah... You are not gonna weasel me this time.<eos> - I want my 35 grand.<eos> - Oh, just hold on.<eos> Would I come here, to your church, if I scammed you?

But, Ali, this is a great neighbourhood.<eos> I mean, our lives are filled with joy and kids and barbecues.<eos> But if you really feel like there's some other purpose for you, you should trust that.<eos> Ah, Mrs. Hendrix!<eos> Whoo! - Alison, what are you doing?<eos> Donnie, I'm so high. - I mean, I'm so...<eos> - I'm so high, Donnie.<eos> Is that Ramone?<eos> ! - You little shit!<eos> - Mr. Hendrix, I swear I didn't rip you off.
- Holy shit!<eos> - Is he Okay?<eos> Yes. He's fine. Just been dealing with a medical condition.<eos> Looks like they're both alchies.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I may have my demons, but don't you dare go after my Donnie!<eos> All right. You know what?<eos> It's all right. No. I know exactly what you all think of me.<eos> But I'm not just a boozer, I'm a pill popper too!<eos> That's right. And half of you bought them from me!

I know what really gets you off about being on the con.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Tell me.<eos> See you in the game, Maddie.<eos> - Right down this way, please.<eos> - You got it.<eos> There we go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good morning, ma'am.<eos> Can I help you with that?
Yeah, see ya.<eos> See ya.<eos> Is he here yet?<eos> No.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> He'll be here.<eos> All right.<eos> Morning, sir.<eos> If you'd like to go ahead and just park next to that cone over there. It's a special spot<eos> I have waiting just for you.
What about kids?<eos> Hello, thank you so much for being here.<eos> I didn't say I was married.<eos> Didn't say you weren't.<eos> Squabbling already?<eos> Hi.<eos> You know, of all my nieces and nephews,<eos> - Saffron was always my favorite. - Aww.<eos> Honey, this is my uncle, Albert.<eos> Wow. Heard a lot about you.

Heard a lot about you.<eos> We're glad you could make it.<eos> Treat her well.<eos> Or else you'll have to answer to me, and that's not something you want on your calendar.<eos> Well, I think I can handle you, Uncle Albert.
Hands on the wheel.<eos> Real slow now.<eos> License and registration.<eos> Everything all right, officer?<eos> Sorry there, sir.<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> I most certainly will.<eos> Hey, have you seen a woman in a wedding dress?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Are one of you cuties the groom?
Maddie, the bumblers are at the bus station.<eos> I have the case.<eos> Get the ring and get to the rendezvous point, okay?<eos> Let's get rid of these amateurs once and for all.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> _<eos> Agent, would you please tell me where that ridiculously expensive ring that you gave that woman is?<eos> It's safe.<eos> I promise you.
Please come back later.<eos> I can clearly see what's so urgent..<eos> Madam.<eos> Please spare us the speech on 'women empowerment'.<eos> We know what's wrong and right.<eos> Out!<eos> Shut up!<eos> And don't interfere.<eos> I don't want to talk to you.<eos> I didn't come here to stop you. I only came hereto invite you for dinner.
knew your intention wasn't good... right from the wedding function.<eos> If my intentions weren't good, I would've made you my girlfriend... and not proposed to marry you.<eos> Girlfriend?<eos> Did you ever have a girlfriend?<eos> I didn't want one in the first place.<eos> Thank God you didn't, because you could've never had one. Right, sister?<eos> Let's stop discussing about girlfriend-boyfriend... and talk about marriage instead.<eos> I don't want to get married?<eos> Do I have to tattoo that on my arm for you to understand?<eos> Is he bothering you?
It was amazing.<eos> She was begging me to marry her.<eos> But I said we're not in a hurry. I see...<eos> You said you're not in a hurry.<eos> You see, brother, marriages are a tricky business.<eos> It's important to be a little evasive.<eos> Somdev, those people from Kota haven't shown up yet.<eos> Mr. Trivedi has a heart problem as well. He's asked for a week's time.<eos> Ask them to hurry up, he's been asking. Yes...<eos> You two better stop joking. If father loses his temper... he will banish you two from Kota permanently.
Promise?<eos> Promise!<eos> Don't expect anything more, Badri.<eos> Hope is what drives this world.<eos> Listen.<eos> Yes.<eos> You're actually looking smart today.<eos> I look smart every day... but you noticed it today.<eos> What's this board for?<eos> I'll tell you.
I don't know how to help with your suffocation now.<eos> My father sent me to bring you back!<eos> He said he will kill you publicly..<eos> Show everyone the consequences of running away.<eos> Then why did you stop?<eos> Let's go to Jhansi.<eos> That's exactly what I wanted to do.<eos> But I love you too much... it weakens me.<eos> I am Sgt. Laxmi Shankar.<eos> I've been called to communicate with you in Hindi.

He's saying that he'll get you married as soon as you return.<eos> So hurry up.<eos> I'll call you back.<eos> Vaidehi, very few people get this opportunity that you're getting.<eos> So please don't waste it.<eos> Encounter with the cops... is not what we encourage.<eos> Ma'am, actually a friend of mine is here from India... and he just got into a little bit of trouble, so...<eos> I understand.<eos> Maybe you should know this.<eos> We're actually considering you for a posting in Singapore.
I don't need your charity, I won't stay with you.<eos> Where else will you go?<eos> Prison?<eos> You've been given a warning.<eos> Please, Badri, stop this drama.<eos> You think this is drama?<eos> Vaidehi...<eos> The taxi has arrived, shall we?<eos> Yes... coming.<eos> Badri, they let you out on my friend's guarantee.
You okay?<eos> What's going on?<eos> He bites, man.<eos> Go inside.<eos> Wait...<eos> Badri...<eos> Badri, wait!<eos> What's wrong with you, Badri?<eos> How long will you go around beating up people?<eos> You know... Gurmeet got you two out of jail... on his personal guarantee.

Gurmeet got you two out of jail... on his personal guarantee.<eos> He doesn't even know you... in fact, he hardly knows me, but...
I wonder where they...<eos> You okay?<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> Badri.<eos> Quiet...<eos> Somdev.<eos> They tore it all up.<eos> Badri.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I've made food for you two. It's in the fridge.
I love you too.<eos> Thank you, Sergeant, thanks a lot.<eos> Sergeant...<eos> Sergeant...<eos> Does he want to stay here.<eos> He likes this country.<eos> Since you two got here... you're either beating people up or getting beaten up.<eos> What is this?<eos> This is your deportation paper.<eos> They are sending you back.
Because if something happens to you... then I will have to marry someone else.<eos> Which I can't.<eos> Because I want to marry you.<eos> I love you a lot.<eos> Me too.<eos> I love you, Badri.<eos> I love you...<eos> You've chosen the worst time to start our romance.<eos> I'll talk to them.<eos> I know... I hurt you.
That's a...<eos> Yeah, well, I was a nerd growing up and it wasn't easy.<eos> You know, you're always saying that, but I am not buying it.<eos> If anything, you were a hot nerd.<eos> Like, uh, like Velma on Scooby-Doo.<eos> Ah, you think so, huh?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> When you wear your reading glasses...<eos> All right...<eos> Well, that's because I didn't go to the same high school as the three of you.
You know, preferably, in a public place with a lot of people watching.<eos> Okay?<eos> And on top of that, making a profound statement about the underlying issue that started the problem.<eos> That's all.<eos> Wow.<eos> My brother Don is a saint.<eos> So I told Adam, I'm gonna go to the parent mixer with someone who's on my team:<eos> Don.<eos> And I misplayed my hand terribly, so I'm here.<eos> Well, this may come as a shock to you, but I was not the most popular person in high school either.
We?<eos> W-We who?<eos> We...<eos> Marcy?<eos> I don't want to do this anymore, Adam!<eos> Marcy!<eos> That's the stuff!<eos> Okay, I got my keys, I got the tickets.<eos> Vegas, here we come!<eos> I got to tell you, I didn't think this would actually happen.
That's the stuff!<eos> Okay, I got my keys, I got the tickets.<eos> Vegas, here we come!<eos> I got to tell you, I didn't think this would actually happen.<eos> Hey, are we still getting the fake doctor discount?<eos> I got the title.<eos> "Feet:<eos> The Hands of Your Legs."<eos> Okay, guys. Come on.<eos> We're gonna drop you at Nana's on the way to the airport.
No.<eos> I like a little more of a story.<eos> I'm old-fashioned.<eos> Hey, come on, don't you supervise him when he's online?<eos> When he's online?<eos> He's online all the time.<eos> If I was gonna watch what he's doing, I'd have to... quit my job and give the other two kids away.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> My precious, innocent Teddy isn't so innocent anymore.<eos> Now he's-he's just like... one of you.
No. McCaffrey's Irish.<eos> I'm gonna go with the Pope stuck in the phone booth.<eos> Ah.<eos> She'll enjoy the social commentary.<eos> Okay, then you hand out our floating key chains, and try not to give 'em the one with your car keys attached this time.<eos> And then, boom, we-we're done.<eos> Hey, how's the pitch coming?<eos> Looking good, yeah. We're all done.<eos> - We're gonna watch the game.<eos> - Oh, hey, um, how would you feel about inviting Lowell to come watch with you tonight?
- Oh, hey, um, how would you feel about inviting Lowell to come watch with you tonight?<eos> - Lowell?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Here?<eos> On purpose?<eos> I see enough of him at school.<eos> And he was in rare form yesterday at "Bring Your Dad to School" day.<eos> So, as a contractor, I get to use a lot of really cool tools, like, uh, this thermal laser, which can tell me the temperature of anything.<eos> Mrs. Rodriguez is... ice-cold, as usual.<eos> Okay, now Emme is gonna hand out free floating key chains to all of you.
- Uh, no.<eos> - That's rated R.<eos> Uncle Don came in and turned it on.<eos> It's way better than SpongeBob.<eos> I sat on the remote and it just came on.<eos> That's not what happened at all.<eos> He searched for it, found it, and then said,<eos> "Buckle up, kids."<eos> Come on, man.<eos> I also told you not to tell your dad.
- Mm.<eos> - It's fancy.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You know, when I went to the ladies' room, the toilet seat was heated.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And not from somebody else sitting on it.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, and, since I'm only paying Katie three dollars an hour, I am gonna order us the second cheapest bottle of wine.<eos> Mm.<eos> Hi, may I help you?
Uh, no.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No, that's a, uh, uh, an alarm that I set for myself to remind me to tell you that I love you.<eos> Oh...<eos> I love you, I got to go.<eos> Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Go where?<eos> Babe, a love like ours is beyond questions.<eos> Listen, what's so hard about getting a name on a glass?<eos> I'm begging you, find a Sharpie and get it done.
It's in my eyes!<eos> Okay, uh...<eos> Give me something to wipe my eyes.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't have anything.<eos> I... here, oh, here.<eos> - Use my dress.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Good evening, officer.<eos> Well, I pulled you over for doing 50 in a 35, but by the look of things, we have a bit more to talk about.
She has a name, Royce!<eos> Yeah, it's Kate.<eos> Sometimes Katie.<eos> - Ah, guys like that never listen to me.<eos> - Yeah. - Hey, uh, Mrs. Rodriguez?<eos> - Mm? Um, what do you know about that kid Royce that's always hanging around Katie?<eos> Oh, he's one of my favorites.<eos> He's an honor roll student, started his own dog-walking company, even works weekends at the mall.<eos> Oh, I see, huh?<eos> He charmed you, too, huh?
So just, don't let us spoil this for you.<eos> You know?<eos> So... what do you say?<eos> Okay, we'll go on the date.<eos> Oh, great!<eos> Surprise!<eos> Hi. I'm Daphne.<eos> Royce's girlfriend.<eos> You must be his grandparents.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
So... what do you say?<eos> Okay, we'll go on the date.<eos> Oh, great!<eos> Surprise!<eos> Hi. I'm Daphne.<eos> Royce's girlfriend.<eos> You must be his grandparents.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I said, I've heard a lot about you.
Take down Javier red-handed.<eos> Not just his people.<eos> Or you could blow this whole case.<eos> Now, I'm calling this little adventure off.<eos> Take them into custody.<eos> Sir, listen...<eos> Now, Gregorio.<eos> Isler?<eos> A minute?<eos> We'll call you back.
He got away with the cash.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Start of the day, we had cartel lieutenant Ernesto Blanco, millions in drug money and a foothold in the Javier Garcia investigation.<eos> Now Blanco's dead, the cash is gone and Javier's walking free.<eos> Emile Rojas is a cartel hit man.<eos> He killed Blanco, took the cash, probably on Javier's orders after the Coast Guard seized his yacht.<eos> And where's Rojas now?<eos> In the wind.<eos> Which leaves us where?<eos> I'll tell you where:
I have no idea where that came from.<eos> From drug trafficking, Ms. West.<eos> That's, uh, blood money.<eos> It-- this can't be true.<eos> Well, we'll figure it out back at my office.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, am I being arrested?<eos> No one's under arrest.<eos> Not yet, at least.<eos> Ms. West, do you have a jacket?<eos> One of my agents will get it for you.
Sometimes attending charity events around the city.<eos> Please say that's not all you have.<eos> Javier's an embed.<eos> He was sent to blend in.<eos> He's not burying bodies in his yard.<eos> He's careful.<eos> Eliza was there when Ernesto Blanco murdered an innocent man on Javier's yacht.<eos> She had three million in cartel cash at her stables.<eos> He's not that careful.<eos> Now, I'm trying to work with you, Pride.
Probably 'cause he knows we're on to him.<eos> What do you think he'll do to her if he finds out she's cooperating?<eos> And how many others die if we let him go, Pride?<eos> I won't put Eliza in danger.<eos> It's not your choice.<eos> Ever since my father was killed, my family and I have tried to help people, to do the right thing.<eos> You know what we're asking?<eos> You want me to copy his hard drive.<eos> Just show me how.<eos> We'll walk you through every step.
I wanted to apologize.<eos> For what?<eos> How you were treated yesterday.<eos> FBI's not much on courtesy.<eos> It's not how I would have handled things.<eos> Especially since you're engaged to Eliza.<eos> Dwayne.<eos> I was surprised to find out you knew each other, but New Orleans is such a small city.<eos> It's the biggest small town in America.<eos> Oh, it's one of my personal favorites for you.
W-Wait. Did you just say, "one wrong command"?<eos> Don't worry about that.<eos> Just listen to me.<eos> I'm gonna tell you what to type.<eos> All right?<eos> All caps.<eos> CDW CS2, forward slash.<eos> Now hit "enter."<eos> You know, you got a beautiful yacht, too.<eos> I... I'm hoping to get it back to you soon.
CDW CS2, forward slash.<eos> Now hit "enter."<eos> You know, you got a beautiful yacht, too.<eos> I... I'm hoping to get it back to you soon.<eos> Is that possible?<eos> I mean, know it's...<eos> it's a crime scene, and...<eos> Well... I'll shake a few trees.<eos> I'd appreciate it.<eos> I'm sorry to-to keep you waiting.
I mean, even after everything you've been through?<eos> Duty calls.<eos> I'm sure you understand, Dwayne.<eos> Of course.<eos> Maybe I should come with you.<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> That's very sweet.<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> Shall we?<eos> I don't know about you, but I could use a drink.
Why would a dragon want baby teeth?<eos> - Shit.<eos> - I collect baby teeth.<eos> As I collect many things, little mammal.<eos> Uh, greetings, your Ladyship.<eos> "Your Ladyship"?<eos> I am a Queen of the Great Worms.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> Uh, that's awesome--I wasn't suggesting that you weren't.<eos> Your manner does not endear me to you, human.
Of course you are.<eos> Uh, that's awesome--I wasn't suggesting that you weren't.<eos> Your manner does not endear me to you, human.<eos> We seek passage to the Underworld, oh Ancient One.<eos> Hmm. You seek to die.<eos> Uh, no, actually, we were hoping to come back after.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> I require a gift.<eos> A gift?<eos> Um... yeah, I mean, name it, and we'll get it for you.
No.<eos> If you wish to return home, you must find other means.<eos> The first door remains open, little mammal.<eos> Great, um, I super love riddles.<eos> Are you giving me the button or not?<eos> Your bodies will stay here, and your souls will travel.<eos> You have 24 hours to return to the portal.<eos> Or?<eos> I sit patiently, waiting for you to come back.<eos> No, I eat you--I'm a fucking dragon, what do you expect?
I'm sorry, I had a whole thing--<eos> Your Majesty, this presentation is beautiful, but...<eos> It would be so much better with fire dancers, I know.<eos> I hope my arrival isn't causing undue stress.<eos> Stress?<eos> - I'm not stressed-- - Eliot.<eos> - I don't care about ceremony.<eos> - You don't?<eos> - But--<eos> - But I came here for you.
- But I came here for you.<eos> Well... the feeling's mutual.<eos> Take me somewhere we can become a bit better acquainted.<eos> Alone.<eos> Congratulations, you're dead.<eos> You've passed through the veil to the Underworld.<eos> Is this your final destination?<eos> No.<eos> It's the first leg of your journey.<eos> We designed this part of the Underworld for you, based on your life and personal expectations to facilitate a comfortable transition.
I'm 173.<eos> Place your hands on the counter for identification, please.<eos> Hey, do you know where they were taking that guy just now?<eos> Oh, his soul is missing a little piece.<eos> They just took him somewhere where he would be more comfortable.<eos> So he could be reunited with it?<eos> I doubt it, that's very difficult to do.<eos> Especially after a prolonged separation.<eos> Yeah, but you can't just take--<eos> I assure you, all the Shades are safe and well protected for their eternity.
No, look, I had an incident when I was a kid.<eos> - My fingers got stuck in the--<eos> - Oh, get over it.<eos> Your girl would.<eos> - She's not my girl.<eos> - No shit.<eos> She's tough as granite.<eos> And you're afraid to bowl.<eos> Fine.<eos> How long before the dragon eats you and Quentin?
A power that acts, not for gain, but solely because it can.<eos> That's the true danger.<eos> Face that.<eos> Or face the end of your kingdom.<eos> - I got a question for you.<eos> - Of course.<eos> How can I help?<eos> You know, I never got your name.<eos> You may call me Head Librarian.<eos> And, uh... what do I get to call you outside of work?
I'm here if you need anything else.<eos> - Hey, guys.<eos> - Mr. Corrigan.<eos> Uh, Mr. Corrigan, you have no need to be in here.<eos> Just a couple of questions.<eos> - I'm gonna take a number.<eos> - Please, sir.<eos> Um, you know what, I'm gonna take a couple of numbers, just in case I don't-- I don't hear the first number.<eos> Yeah, wow, you guys got a lot of numbers.<eos> Mr. Corrigan, I beseech you.
This is books for school kids.<eos> If it's so important, finding me that five mil can't be too hard.<eos> I'm not adding another amendment.<eos> You invited me in.<eos> You knew what you were getting into.<eos> Right.<eos> You're going to support this bill.<eos> In fact, your yes will be the first vote cast.<eos> John, this bill should've been passed a long time ago.<eos> And I'm sorry for trying to drag you into the ditch on this.
Professor Lipson told me to bring him here.<eos> If you're still after Reynard, I want in.<eos> Eliot?<eos> Oh, you.<eos> I shouldn't be here, but...<eos> Please.<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> - Be careful.<eos> - So not a nice scotch, then?<eos> It will transport you to the fairy realm.

- They moved to North Carol... what?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How did none of us know about this? How is that possible?<eos> - Eh, they moved.<eos> It happened.<eos> - We need to make more of an effort.<eos> We don't even know that our friend has moved to a different state.<eos> I mean, we're still friends.<eos> We just have nothing to do with each other.<eos> This doesn't bother you?
I appreciate the idea.<eos> I want to hear more about it.<eos> I feel like I'm being teased.<eos> Let me guess, you guys are pre-gaming before your high school reunion.<eos> You were nerds, but you grew up to be super handsome.<eos> You were cool but approachable.<eos> Maybe you were rollerbladers...<eos> Okay. Here's the deal.<eos> You're all models now, and that's your new manager.<eos> There's only one number on this card, and there's two of you.
That's right, man.<eos> Band of brothers, bro.<eos> Band of brothers.<eos> You know, I've been a little bit curious about it this whole time.<eos> I just couldn't admit it to you guys, you know?<eos> I think this would be more dignified if we did it in silence.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Yeah, let's do this in silence.<eos> - Good luck, guys.<eos> - I'm ready for you, lady.
More than that, you... you understood the theory behind the spell, and-- and you reshaped it.<eos> Your discipline is meta-composition.<eos> You are a Knowledge student.<eos> - Knowledge?<eos> - Part psychic, part physical.<eos> There really is no branch it doesn't touch on.<eos> The short version:<eos> you are drawn, mind and body, to the discovery of magic.<eos> Is it true that they-- um, well that we-- live in the attic above the Library?<eos> I assure you it is much more luxurious than it sounds.
Welcome.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You are free to go.<eos> Why would you let me go?<eos> Because, Ms. Wicker, you are not a student here, and I'm not running a jail.<eos> Kady locked me up for a good reason.<eos> I should feel terrible about what I did.<eos> But I don't.<eos> I just think it's terrible, and I think I would've never done it if I were me.<eos> One thing I've learned about you, Ms. Wicker, is that you are a searcher.

Penny, Reynard is my problem.<eos> We've been over this.<eos> Rapist monsters are a universal problem.<eos> And the last time you tried to help, you signed, like, a billion-year contract with The Order.<eos> When does that start, by the way?<eos> Not today.<eos> Takes 'em four weeks to process a book request.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Uh... where are we?<eos> Penny, we've processed your application and would like to formally welcome you to The Order.

A question I've asked myself very often at 3:00 a.m.<eos> - So I was doing the dishes--<eos> - You're supposed to be cooking.<eos> I know.<eos> I... kind of roofied the dishwasher.<eos> Um, that is not okay.<eos> No, not "roofied" roofied.<eos> Uh, more like he loves everyone so much, he's catatonic.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> I was testing the potion for you.
Hello, glorious audience.<eos> It is I, Ember, god of Fillory.<eos> Feel free to bow and grovel.<eos> I'll wait.<eos> Oh, but I've got so much to tell you.
Oh, I know, good one.<eos> It was I who caused the High King's bride to ovulate on the right day, leading to...<eos> Preg-nant!<eos> Ultimately leading to...<eos> The fairies can bring back the Wellspring?<eos> - They can.<eos> - And in return?<eos> A royal child of Whitespire.<eos> Take her to the dungeon.<eos> He will transport you to the fairy realm.
Oh, come on!<eos> Penny, you're needed at once.<eos> - I'm busy.<eos> - Bit of an emergency.<eos> We need our full staff.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> He's dying.<eos> Yes, because he went into a restricted area, which lethally poisoned him and puts him on strict probation, but most assuredly does not mean he's excused from work.<eos> We'll take every step to keep him comfortable.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
No.<eos> Not without my baby.<eos> They took her away.<eos> You have to come with us, okay?<eos> Get the goddamn shackles, Hoberman.<eos> Grab her with me. Come on.<eos> Hey.<eos> Come on.<eos> There you are.<eos> The Queen will see you now.
_ _ _<eos> I'm not gonna beg.<eos> I'm not gonna use guilt, I have no leverage.<eos> But Penny's in the Library.<eos> He can be your mole.<eos> But to do that, he'd have to be alive.<eos> _<eos> He'd never know.<eos> Whatever you need, ask me about it.<eos> He tells me, I tell you.
People find out shit.<eos> - You know Tina Reynolds?<eos> Walgreens?<eos> - Yeah. Yeah. She knows Heather got a pregnancy test.<eos> Doesn't mean anybody's gonna tell anybody about anything.<eos> Look, dude, I've been buying extra-large condoms at that place for years.<eos> Still can't get that rumor started.<eos> Hey, Beau.<eos> Hey, Joanne.<eos> Good to see you.

I did wear one to a Rockies game one time.<eos> Made it 17 innings, never got up once.<eos> Well, what about that other deal?<eos> You and your dad got that figured out?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We figured out how to say "fuck you" in Morse code with our porch lights.<eos> Well, you know your dad. The more he bitches about somethin', the more he cares about it.<eos> Oh, well... then he must really love gun control, salads, and cats.<eos> - Hey, fellas.<eos> - Hey, can I help you?
I don't think I got anything.<eos> You sure you got my right e-mail?<eos> Oh, is it, badassrooster6969@yahoo?<eos> Huh, that's it.<eos> Must've went to my spam.<eos> Well, nice to meet you, Rich.<eos> You know Dale Rivers?<eos> He's our vet.<eos> Nice to meet you, Dale.<eos> I heard a lot of great things about you.
What's the matter?<eos> Your Hello Kitty Ranch doesn't have any tools?<eos> It's My Little Pony Ranch.<eos> Why can't anybody fuckin' remember that?<eos> And no, Dad, it's like an hour away, all right?<eos> I ain't got time for this shit.<eos> Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?<eos> Hi, I have an appointment.<eos> Heather Roth.<eos> Okay, just fill out these forms, and we'll call you.
- Yeah.<eos> - Come on in.<eos> Hey, Heather, you've got company!<eos> Something smells good.<eos> Yeah, we're making apple pie.<eos> It'll be ready in about an hour if you wanna sit and chat.<eos> Chat for an hour?<eos> I like apple pie, but not that much.<eos> Mr. Bennett.<eos> Good to see you.
I don't need any money.<eos> But just out of curiosity, how much could I have gotten?<eos> A lot more than either of them.<eos> The thing is...<eos> I don't have a lot of positive male role models in my life, and... you don't have to say yes... but I was wondering if you'd be the baby's godfather.<eos> I'm flattered.<eos> But don't you think I'm a little... old?<eos> You're only as old as you feel.<eos> Well, I feel older than I am.<eos> Mr. Bennett, if my child ever had a problem... I can't imagine anyone I'd want them coming to more than you.
Just admit it.<eos> You don't like me.<eos> You've never liked me.<eos> I'm just some dumb student that you taught in high school, and if Colt didn't exist, you would've already forgot about me.<eos> Okay, Heather, I like you, okay?<eos> And the word's "forgotten," not "forgot," but I correct everyone.<eos> - Point is, I like you.<eos> - All right...<eos> She likes you, you like her.<eos> I like you both, and we all like pie.
Holy shit!<eos> I ain't never seen that before.<eos> I normally get extra cheese. It's better that way.<eos> Colt fucked up.<eos> It's still pretty good.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Truth is... I'm jealous.<eos> You know, I... thought I'd be the one starting a family with Colt.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I didn't mean to take that from you.

I don't regret.<eos> Just so you know... I'm jealous of you, too.
Chased them and tripped over a teeter-totter.<eos> Listen, Berto's in a little bit of trouble.<eos> - What's goin' on?<eos> - He's being deported.<eos> You're illegal?<eos> Why didn't you tell us?<eos> There's no upside to it.<eos> Gallo, we live in fear every day.<eos> You know, five miles over the speed limit, and it could ruin our life.<eos> Why would I wanna put that on you, too?
You'll land on your feet.<eos> - Yes, I will.<eos> All right.<eos> - Thanks, Ed.<eos> I'm gonna need these.<eos> - Hey, Beau.<eos> How are you?<eos> - Hey, Joanne.<eos> Good.<eos> It's good to see you.
- Yes, I will.<eos> All right.<eos> - Thanks, Ed.<eos> I'm gonna need these.<eos> - Hey, Beau.<eos> How are you?<eos> - Hey, Joanne.<eos> Good.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> What brings you by?
And every night, they seat you at a different table so you get to meet all kinds of new people.<eos> And your reward at the end of this rainbow of fun is being dropped off in Mexico?<eos> And... brought you a little gift.<eos> Mickey Mouse ears with "Grumpy" on it!<eos> Grumpy?<eos> I don't get it.<eos> I tried to get them to make me one for Colt, but they wouldn't put "Shithead" on it.<eos> Hey, the storm's settling in.<eos> You're welcome to come in for a drink till it lets up.<eos> If I come in, I'm gonna talk to you.
Anyway, it's none of my business, but... your friend seemed pretty pissed off earlier.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well...<eos> - I'm a musician...<eos> - Oh, got it.<eos> You think your friend is coming back?<eos> Nope.<eos> She just sent me a video of her throwing all my clothes out her car window.<eos> You never really know how much denim you wear until you see it spread out all along the side of a highway.<eos> So, she didn't leave you, she did you a favor.
Too much tequila.<eos> So how'd you end up here?<eos> Finished college... and then I married that cowboy, had a couple of boys, bought this bar... divorced that cowboy, now I'm trying to sell the bar.<eos> Hey, you wouldn't wanna add a bar to the list of things you burned down, would you?<eos> That's cute, you think I haven't burned down a bar.<eos> Why don't I play you another song?<eos> What's your favorite?<eos> "Angel from Montgomery" by John Prine.<eos> Well, you got good taste.<eos> I could talk to you all night long.
Well, I guess we'll just have to keep drinkin'.<eos> I knew I liked you.<eos> - I'm glad you came over, Joanne.<eos> - Me too.<eos> I missed you, Beau.<eos> All right, you did it. You ruined it.<eos> - I gotta get that.<eos> If that's one of my boys, I'm gonna kill him.<eos> Hey, Beau.<eos> Sorry to bother you.
Sit there long enough, you get a real good workout in your core.<eos> Hey, Dale, can we focus up here?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Work.<eos> Well, I don't know much, but, uh... I got some odd jobs around here you could do in the meantime.<eos> I could pay you by the hour.<eos> I mean, yeah, Dale, that'd be great.<eos> Thanks, I'll take it.<eos> Dale?<eos> Uh, Dale, I think Charlene's callin' you. Yeah, I heard her, but, uh... she don't need to know that.
You know, I see this every prom.<eos> Girls on one side, guys on the other side.<eos> Everyone too scared to make a move.<eos> And then there's Miss Phillips in the middle, doing the robot alone!<eos> You should talk to Joanne.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's the only way to find out what she's thinkin'.<eos> - Appreciate it, Abby.<eos> - Oh, anytime, Mr. Bennett.<eos> If I ever need advice about Colt and me, I'll come to you.
Holy shit.<eos> Is this an intervention?<eos> - Did you break our pact? - Uh, no.<eos> Did you?<eos> Like we said...<eos> "Never be part of the other person's intervention."<eos> All right, cool.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> Something I need to talk to you about...
- Why the hell did you go talk to Paul?<eos> What?<eos> Why'd you do that?<eos> Well, 'cause you're having my kid.<eos> If this guy's a piece of shit, that's a problem.<eos> Yeah, but that's not your place to do that, Colt.<eos> Sure it is.<eos> I'm the father.<eos> Back me up here, Ab.<eos> No, this is between you two.
- Hey, Maggie.<eos> - You've gotta be fuckin' kiddin' me.<eos> Believe it or not, I've gotten worse welcomes.<eos> Here's everything I took, plus interest.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Bye.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was out of options.<eos> I just needed to get to my next gig, then I knew I could pay you back.
I was out of options.<eos> I just needed to get to my next gig, then I knew I could pay you back.<eos> I had a really good time with you that night.<eos> I don't want you thinking it was just a way to get your guard down.<eos> Why would I think that?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> You fucking robbed me.<eos> I really am sorry.<eos> And you know the worst part?<eos> I didn't make any money at that gig, so I had to rob them to pay you back.
I've been fiddling with that thing for weeks.<eos> Can't imagine she's gonna fix it.<eos> Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.<eos> Yep, that's my ringtone.<eos> Thanks, folks.<eos> I'll be back in a bit.<eos> Uh, and remember, the more you drink, the better I sound.<eos> Hey.<eos> I didn't think you were comin'.<eos> Oh, I didn't come to see you.
God, murderous rage is... It's very attractive on you.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm gonna kill you.<eos> While Mr. Reeves is attending this conference, We're gonna be running things. A little more rough and ready around here.<eos> Not to worry.<eos> We'll still have the basics, But nobody's gonna be inventing. Any new robots, at least not until he gets back.<eos> So, Eyes and ears open.<eos> Let's get out there.<eos> Murphy?<eos> Need to talk to you for a minute.
All I know is his posts, okay?<eos> But dude's got some serious demons.<eos> Like psych ward-level stuff.<eos> Talking about Gideon stealing. Ideas straight from his brain.<eos> That's all I got, okay?<eos> It's not good enough.<eos> Keep thinking.<eos> Wait. Just wait.<eos> The wristband the guy was selling, He posted a picture to prove it was real.<eos> I could download it for you.
Well, you know I've always had a problem with authority figures. Right.<eos> Except for the ones you sleep with.<eos> You sure you want to lose that privilege?<eos> Look, Murphy can help us.<eos> So just lay off her, okay?<eos> There.<eos> There!<eos> Got it!<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> What if I told you we could scan the entire crowd? What?
Look, um, I think we got off on the wrong foot.<eos> I just want you to know that it's nothing personal.<eos> Yeah?<eos> So then what is it?<eos> Well, it's just I've been protecting Gideon for years.<eos> I mean, mostly from himself.<eos> The biggest outside threat has been patent attorneys and... Doctors' warnings about his caffeine intake.<eos> And now he has a killer after him.<eos> I really don't see how that's my fault.<eos> But I'm not pointing the finger at you.
Don't look at me.<eos> I'm just the genius.<eos> Jackson Barrett?<eos> Yeah. What's going on?<eos> We're looking for Evan Finley.<eos> You know where he is?<eos> Not really.<eos> I don't...<eos> Mind if we talk outside?<eos> I told you,
Got it.<eos> Cobb,<eos> Reyes, orange hoodie.<eos> Chicago Police!<eos> He's going for the stairs.<eos> Hands up in the air.<eos> Turn around slowly.<eos> Please don't hurt me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What can I tell you?
Hey, Evan.<eos> Just calm down, okay?<eos> Talk to me.<eos> Mr. Finley, this is officer Brandt, Chicago Police.<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> Just tell me what's going through your mind.<eos> Let us help you.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> I've been in your position before.<eos> I am not going to argue with you, sir.
Your dad wants to talk to you.<eos> No, I'm done talking to him!<eos> Okay.<eos> I said get back!<eos> Okay. Just take it easy.<eos> All right, Mr. Finley, the phone call's not gonna work.<eos> New plan.<eos> You got a computer with a camera on it?<eos> Yeah, I...<eos> Good, I'm gonna call you right back.
Well, we're gonna have to get it up high.<eos> The rafters.<eos> He loves this part.<eos> Believe me, I know.<eos> So are you seriously telling me. This can scan the whole crowd for a gun?<eos> Yeah, it's a portable version. Of the full body scanners at airports.<eos> So everyone is gonna jam in to here. For my keynote speech.<eos> There's pretty much no chance a guy obsessed with me.<eos> Is gonna miss that. And that's when we get him.<eos> My gut feeling is that he wants to take you down publicly.
No, it'll never be my own life.<eos> Never.<eos> It will, I promise you it will.<eos> You just got to stay strong, buddy.<eos> I can't anymore.<eos> I'm done talking.<eos> Hey, Pete, What's the eta?<eos> It's getting desperate over here.<eos> I'm almost there.<eos> Just got to warn you, this is not my finest work.
Lauren is right.<eos> This convention is very important to Reeves Industries.<eos> And now, for better or worse, What happens to Reeves happens to the 13th District.<eos> Two... no matter how crazy this killer might be,<eos> We have to catch him before he hurts other people.<eos> So, what, it takes a genius to catch a genius?<eos> It takes a genius to know the only shot.<eos> We have at catching this lunatic involves the both of us, Which brings me to my third argument...<eos> It's probably the most valid.<eos> I know I can go out there 'cause I have you to protect me.
I never met him, but he actually worked. At Reeves for a short time.<eos> Sounds like a smart guy, But hr had to let him go after he failed a psych evaluation.<eos> Apparently, he had "obsessive thoughts and delusions of grandeur. In regard to Mr. Reeves."<eos> He swore he could hear me whispering in his ear. Well, at least we know.<eos> You're not the only one obsessed with you.<eos> You got lucky today.<eos> I mean, five inches north...<eos> Yeah, or 14 inches south, it would have been a disaster.<eos> But it wasn't.<eos> And I have you to thank for that.
Lauren told me about it, and a few other divisions, too.<eos> Said you started them, lost interest and walked away.<eos> And you're worried that I'm gonna do that here?<eos> It's crossed my mind.<eos> Right. Well, you know, all my life,<eos> I've, chased the most interesting problem, The hardest thing to solve, And some of 'em turn out to be too easy.<eos> But believe me, Murphy, this... This is the hardest one ever.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> No matter what Lauren says.<eos> Who is she to you?
Right. Well, you know, all my life,<eos> I've, chased the most interesting problem, The hardest thing to solve, And some of 'em turn out to be too easy.<eos> But believe me, Murphy, this... This is the hardest one ever.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> No matter what Lauren says.<eos> Who is she to you?<eos> We were classmates at mit.<eos> I went into tech, and she went into tech finance.<eos> My first rocket... she...<eos> Gideon, who is she to you?
I'm not going anywhere.<eos> No matter what Lauren says.<eos> Who is she to you?<eos> We were classmates at mit.<eos> I went into tech, and she went into tech finance.<eos> My first rocket... she...<eos> Gideon, who is she to you?<eos> That's complicated.<eos> You are on fire.<eos> What has gotten into you?
Yes!<eos> I will see you this Sunday at brunch, Mother.<eos> Holy Bananas Foster, it's Batman!<eos> Your Batarang...<eos> Did I see a Batarang fly in here?<eos> You mean this one?<eos> - Oh-ho! - Are you a Batman fan too?<eos> A fan?<eos> Hardly.<eos> Let me tell you a story that will shake you to your core.
Wow. That seems like overkill.<eos> Try and break it.<eos> I dare you.<eos> Okay, we still haven't figured out waterproofing.<eos> Can I see your phone?<eos> Are you gonna drop it in a beer?<eos> The... the picture on the home screen is just a joke.<eos> I don't really like "Gilmore Girls."<eos> Unless you also like them, in which case I'm Team Jess.<eos> Okay, I don't normally give out my number, but I have a good feeling about you.
Build an army and I will command it.<eos> Sleep well. Sleep well.<eos> Good night.<eos> Your sister is pretty.<eos> The cocksure, long-haired fool there, he's a pretender, I'm sure.<eos> In Eoferwic, the Saxon people rose up against their invaders, the brothers Erik and Sigefrid.<eos> I know the brothers will seek revenge for what they lost, and that Kjartan the Cruel will not rest in his search for the dead horseman.<eos> Uhtred Ragnarson... is mine.<eos> Destiny is all.<eos> I see the new king is keeping you busy. He is.
To whom do you belong?<eos> We serve the Dane, Earl Brynjar.<eos> We're settled north and east of here.<eos> I know of Brynjar.<eos> Well, I am Guthred, I'm king of Cumberland.<eos> Lord... forgive me. No, no, no!<eos> If you are here to join me, there's nothing to forgive.<eos> Brynjar's not with you?<eos> My lord is an old man now.<eos> He sends you here, why?
I will speak to the abbot, and my sister shall do her duty.<eos> Finish this for me, Clapa.<eos> Lady Gisela.<eos> Lord Uhtred.<eos> May I sit?<eos> Please.<eos> Are you a Christian?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> I would sit here to please the abbot, but... now I find there's... there's peace here.<eos> I am disturbing you.
He is the king.<eos> I do not belong to him.<eos> He thinks otherwise, but I will not be his gift.<eos> And you believe you will have a choice?<eos> I will... not... be his gift.<eos> I have my own mind.<eos> The abbot Eadred dreamt my brother to be king, but it was not his idea to offer a ransom.<eos> It was not his idea that we should go to Alfred for silver.<eos> It was you? It was.<eos> That all said, without you, Lord, my brother would not be free.
This is our first victory and it will not be our last!<eos> It will not be our last!<eos> So let's celebrate!<eos> Clapa!<eos> Halig!<eos> Cut off their heads, put them in a sack and keep them safe.<eos> I shall make a present of them to Kjartan.<eos> Yes, Lord.<eos> Right, you are far... from what I would call warriors, but you did well.<eos> I am grateful. Thank you.
Have you done this before?<eos> Never, but I know it's best to wait, for the blood to thicken.<eos> I would like to have some of their mail, or leather.<eos> I will earn it... by taking the first head.<eos> You can take what you want. I need to become accustomed... to how it feels.<eos> No, I will earn it.<eos> You earned it at the stables...<eos> Hild!<eos> We'll be using an axe.<eos> Lords and Earls of Cumberland, I thank you for showing this great unity.
We'll be using an axe.<eos> Lords and Earls of Cumberland, I thank you for showing this great unity.<eos> Cumberland has, over the years, become a land for both Dane and Saxon.<eos> Together, with the power of the Christian God, we can achieve great things.<eos> Amen. Amen.<eos> As your king, I have decided... that it's time for our army to march!<eos> To Eoferwic!<eos> Lord, I am Ulf.<eos> Ulf?<eos> My father spoke very well of you.
Now!<eos> Lord Uhtred! Lord Uhtred!<eos> With luck we shall both live.<eos> I could have killed him, Lord, made good my escape.<eos> Kill him and you will die slowly.<eos> Told you.<eos> I asked your man to fetch you, Lord! I do not murder. I wish to bargain.<eos> A life for a life, is it?<eos> My life for my sword.<eos> I wish to serve you, Lord.
You are Kjartan's man.<eos> No.<eos> I'm Kjartan's bastard son who whelped on a slave girl.<eos> And you are Uhtred Ragnarson... and I wish to serve a warrior and a lord, a true lord.<eos> If you believe me to be these things, then put down your sword.<eos> You guarantee my life?<eos> Put down your sword.<eos> Kill him!<eos> Put down your sword.<eos> I can be of use to you, Lord.
I would like you to make a journey, to Bebbanburg... to Lord Aelfric.<eos> Is Aelfric not our enemy?<eos> He is our enemy solely because he is Uhtred's enemy and yet he is a Christian.<eos> Can we say the same of the long-haired peacock?<eos> To face the Northmen, to face Kjartan the Dane, we will need men, God-fearing men.<eos> Lord Aelfric could well provide those men.<eos> I have offered him a bargain, in this letter.<eos> You will bring me an answer.<eos> I will, Lord.<eos> May God be with you.
The king is a man of the one true God... his preference is that we come to an agreement.<eos> It will need to be a handsome agreement.<eos> Make your offer.<eos> In exchange for peace, in compensation for the loss of Eoferwic, I will offer you a fortress, at Dunholm.<eos> Kjartan is at Dunholm.<eos> We will join together and we will take it.<eos> Kjartan's land will become your land.<eos> You offer nothing.<eos> Dunholm is too strong, it cannot be taken.<eos> What I am offering you, Sigefrid, is life, life as an Earl!
But it can be done?<eos> There are other ways.<eos> It can be done, yes.<eos> Then that is what we do.<eos> Lord, this is not a plan that can be decided upon quickly.<eos> There are other ways!<eos> Uhtred, as the king explained earlier, you do not have a voice...<eos> I will say what's on my mind and clearly!<eos> This plan can never work... there are other ways to defeat Kjartan.<eos> It seems everyone is wrong but you, Uhtred Ragnarson.
Lord, there are no weaknesses.<eos> There are always weaknesses.<eos> I will see for myself.<eos> Uhtred, I believe, is a threat to your crown... a threat even greater than the brothers.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> I do not see that.<eos> I am indebted to Uhtred.<eos> Lord, we are all in his debt.<eos> But in helping to free you, did he not also act for himself?
Yes.<eos> I ask that you make peace with me.<eos> I ask that you offer your sister in marriage.<eos> The attraction, it is reciprocated, I expect?<eos> Mm-hmm. She feels the same?<eos> She does, I believe.<eos> You have been spending time with her?<eos> We've spoken, yes.<eos> Then, there can be no argument.<eos> I hereby officially now see you as a rival.
You are to be sold.<eos> We're to be sold?<eos> Lord, we are your army!<eos> We saved you!<eos> It's not lost on me that while you gave me my freedom, I am now taking yours.<eos> You will become a slave, Uhtred.<eos> No! And Halig with you.<eos> No! No! You have no argument with Halig, let him go free.<eos> No, Lord.<eos> I will stay beside you.
My dear, it is not that I wish to abandon him, it is how do I find him?<eos> Lord, what of his brother, Ragnar?<eos> Would he not wish to find Uhtred?<eos> And he is more capable than Father Beocca.<eos> Yes.<eos> Ragnar is a hostage!<eos> And a man of his word.<eos> Could he not remain a hostage whilst outside of Winchester?<eos> Earl Ragnar.<eos> I have a task for you.
Witnesses at the scene describe...<eos> Much obliged.<eos> Frank Bama.<eos> Man, I didn't know you were in town.<eos> I had a little problem with a client turned out to be a budding warlord.<eos> Threatened to cut my head off if I didn't fly for him.<eos> I decided it was time for a little RR.<eos> Good thinking. So, your boss, offered up his couch.<eos> It was economically desirable, so here I am.<eos> Well, it's good to see you.
The one with the hula girl mailbox... I'm sure that's where I dropped him off.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay, how sure?<eos> Eight... Ni... ninety-five percent.<eos> Works for me.<eos> By the way, this should go without saying, but you do not leave this vehicle, you understand?<eos> Got it.<eos> And I should warn you,<eos> Stealthy has a couple of, outstanding warrants on his head... just trespassing and whatnot.<eos> He might not be so happy to see you.
Must be Friday.<eos> You know, Max, you can always set your account up for direct deposit, and that way you won't have the hassle of coming in the bank every week.<eos> Your time-saving assessment is quite correct.<eos> I've had this thought myself, but eventually decided against it.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Why's that? FBI crime data shows a spike in Internet banking fraud, most notably in direct deposit scams, which is turning out to be quite troublesome.<eos> Here I thought the reason you came in every week was to see me.<eos> It is.<eos> I-I-I... I mean, y-yes, you... are the reason why I come in.<eos> I was just looking, for a... the right moment to ask you... for your... for your phone number.
You ready for this? Yeah.<eos> 8:00 this morning, he makes a 40-second call to Brian Hadley's cell phone.<eos> So Rorke and his partners steal something out of Hadley's safe, and then they call Hadley.<eos> Yeah, which, Hadley conveniently forgets to tell Danny and I when we spoke to him.<eos> So, then, is it just me, or is this starting to look more like an extortion attempt?<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> No one has attempted to blackmail me or any of my clients.<eos> We have phone records that suggest otherwise.<eos> Why don't you just let us help you?

And I'm sorry that that happened.<eos> Believe me, I want to help...<eos> I don't think you are.<eos> I don't think you are sorry, all right?<eos> You're obstructing an investigation.<eos> You understand that?<eos> Why don't you just tell us what the hell is going on?<eos> Again, that information is confidential.<eos> Not only am I within my rights to protect my client's interests.<eos> I could be disbarred for cooperating with you.
Book him, Danno.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take that.<eos> Five more minutes!<eos> Well, look at that.<eos> We're done.<eos> I got to say, reading some of your diaries,<eos> I see Max Bergman in a whole new light.<eos> But there's something I've been dying to ask you.

DS9 action figures a few times.<eos> They were obviously important to you.
Edward Gabler. Right?<eos> You know what else we figured out?<eos> We figured out what was stolen from that safe.<eos> It was the knife that Gabler used to kill his girlfriend, Heather Mayfield.<eos> We know that because we pulled her autopsy report.<eos> And our M.E. compared her stab wound to the victim's stab wound, and confirmed that it was the same blade.<eos> Somehow Leo Stein figured out that you had that knife.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe wanted some cash.<eos> Came to you.

He threatened to go public.<eos> He told me he wanted justice for Heather.<eos> It wasn't about the money for him.<eos> He was... I don't know... An idealist.<eos> So you fired him just in case he did go public.<eos> Nobody would believe him.<eos> They'd think he was just upset 'cause he got laid off.<eos> It's good.<eos> It's smart.<eos> I'll tell you what's gonna happen now.
All right, Flip.<eos> Very nice.<eos> Great.<eos> Hey, everyone.<eos> Friends, Hawaiians, countrymen.<eos> And women.<eos> Lend me your ears.<eos> Is he lit?<eos> Hammered.<eos> Max. I don't know you very well.
But you seem like a good egg.<eos> And you're... you're obviously well-loved.<eos> I mean, look at this turn out.<eos> Anyhoo, I wanted to wish you luck.<eos> Rumor has it, you're heading to Madagascar.<eos> Never been myself, but hear it's lovely.<eos> So, I want to wish you safe travels.<eos> I wish you health and happiness.<eos> A-And, may the odds be ever in your favor.<eos> And if any of you are interested in acquiring a Crime Clean franchise...
Well, um, thank you, everyone, for coming out tonight.<eos> And a very special mahalo to Kamekona for hosting tonight's festivities.<eos> Also, I want to reassure my, now, former colleagues that the M.E.'s office will be in very capable hands.<eos> Dr. Noelani Kunha is more than up to the task.<eos> However, if you ever need consult on open or prior investigations, of course I am available by e-mail or text.<eos> So please contact me at any time.<eos> So with that, I just wanted to say mahalo.<eos> It's been a honor and privilege to be working with the HPD and the Five-0 Task Force. Thanks, man.<eos> But, what I will miss the most is... is my adopted family.<eos> And by that I mean you.
And when I started working with the Five-0, I finally got one.<eos> Mahalo, Max.<eos> This might be a surprise to you, but I always considered you as something of a role model.<eos> That does, that does surprise me.<eos> Surprises us all, Max, but go on.<eos> I've always been on the receiving end of your sarcasm, but, truth be told, it never bothered me.<eos> I always took them as a token of affection.<eos> I'm going to miss your little quips.<eos> I hope that you would consider texting me one of those from time to time.<eos> To you, buddy.
Without you, I would've never married my beautiful Sabrina.<eos> And Detective Williams is my role model as an individual, but your loving relationship with Adam is something that Sabrina and I hope to emulate.<eos> Love you, Max.<eos> I'll miss your smile.<eos> Yes, that one.<eos> I know a part of you will always belong to Chicago, but Hawaii has claimed you as one of its sons, and I truly believe that the islands are a better place because you are here.<eos> Damn it, Max.<eos> Thank you for being a friend and all your counsel.<eos> You've changed me in many ways, and allowed me to grow in ways I never could've imagined.<eos> All of you will be ohana to me.

Previously on Vikings...<eos> Princess Ellisif.<eos> I wanted to marry you.
Previously on Vikings...<eos> Princess Ellisif.<eos> I wanted to marry you.<eos> I'm already married.<eos> Everything I have done, I have done for you.
I ask myself, "Why did they bother to come all this way<eos> "if they're not interested in buying anything?"<eos> Attack!<eos> What were they doing?<eos> Looking for weaknesses in our defenses.<eos> Seems like they found one.<eos> Open the gates!<eos> The bishop was in battle with King Aelle.<eos> Dear God.<eos> His Grace is certainly closer to God right now than to you, Prince Aethelwulf.

And may you rest in peace.<eos> Give the bishop a proper and decent Christian burial.<eos> Even in such times, we must do what is right.<eos> So, King Aelle is defeated.<eos> Most horribly and barbarously put to death, sire.<eos> So it is said.<eos> Well, I'm sorry to hear it.<eos> For all our sakes.<eos> That great army is doubtless on its way here already.<eos> I charge you, my son, to go out and face it.
I charge you, my son, to go out and face it.<eos> If it really is as great as the bishop suggested, then I'll need some extra time to raise more men at arms.<eos> I agree.<eos> But now time itself is of the essence.<eos> They cannot bring such a force, on foot, or by boat, to Wessex within a week!<eos> Even so, the element of surprise is the most valuable asset.<eos> Father, since you've given me command, then let me exercise it.<eos> Father, I want to fight with you.<eos> As do I.<eos> And I won't risk the lives of either of you.

My duty is to protect you.<eos> Go to bed.<eos> Sleep peacefully.<eos> Good boy.<eos> Good boy.<eos> I hope to God you're right, my son.<eos> For right now, all the dreams and plans I had stand in the greatest jeopardy.<eos> You're not the only one who had dreams, Father.<eos> If you'll forgive me, I have messengers to dispatch.<eos> I urge you again to go back to him, my love.
I hope to God you're right, my son.<eos> For right now, all the dreams and plans I had stand in the greatest jeopardy.<eos> You're not the only one who had dreams, Father.<eos> If you'll forgive me, I have messengers to dispatch.<eos> I urge you again to go back to him, my love.<eos> He will need the strength and brilliance of your mind.<eos> You must forgive him, as he must forgive you.<eos> There's no need to remain attached to a dying animal like me.<eos> What if I don't want to?<eos> Then I shall have to command you, being your King.
What if I don't want to?<eos> Then I shall have to command you, being your King.<eos> My lady.<eos> Why can't you sleep?<eos> Are you afraid?<eos> No.<eos> - I'm not afraid.<eos> - Good.<eos> You have no reason to be afraid.<eos> Your father watches over you the whole time.
Your father watches over you the whole time.<eos> But you are my father.<eos> I mean, your real father.<eos> You know very well.<eos> The monk they called Athelstan.<eos> Oh, he was a very holy man, Alfred.<eos> He was a very special man.<eos> He changed all our lives.<eos> You should be very proud to have a father like him.<eos> I'm also proud to have a father like you.
I'm also proud to have a father like you.<eos> This way!<eos> Come!<eos> Quickly!<eos> Come!<eos> Quickly!<eos> From the fury of the Northmen, O Lord, deliver us!<eos> Quick!<eos> Keep moving!<eos> May God, in his mercy, bless and keep you.
I see their spineless God running away from our gods.<eos> For once, why don't you just listen to an older, wiser brother?<eos> These people who are running away, they're not warriors.<eos> They are not the ones who will stay and fight to defend this kingdom.<eos> And protect their honor.<eos> For what is a warrior without his honor?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You tell me, brother.<eos> And, tell me again, how many battles have you fought?<eos> Same as you, brother, except I don't ride around in a comfortable bloody chariot!
And protect their honor.<eos> For what is a warrior without his honor?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You tell me, brother.<eos> And, tell me again, how many battles have you fought?<eos> Same as you, brother, except I don't ride around in a comfortable bloody chariot!<eos> What you have to learn, Ivar, is that if you break up this brotherhood, we shall not succeed.<eos> We have many challenges ahead of us.<eos> So, if you want to keep arguing and whining like a little girl, then I suggest you leave.<eos> We don't need you.
Maybe she loves him.<eos> And, if she loves him, then he is somebody.<eos> How are you suddenly so wise, brother?<eos> It may have escaped your attention but I am not married myself.<eos> You know why?<eos> I don't understand women any more than you do.<eos> Women are fickle.<eos> Forget her.<eos> Ellisif?<eos> I came to forgive you.
Ellisif?<eos> I came to forgive you.<eos> It is not your fault you could not wait for me.<eos> You probably thought it was an impossible task you had set me, in any case.<eos> I was never supposed to achieve it.<eos> You never really intended to marry me, did you?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't even know your name.<eos> My name is Vik, King Harald.<eos> I am happy to meet you.
But I'm glad that you have forgiven her.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Hmm?<eos> No!<eos> Vik!<eos> Vik.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> They say you are called Egil!<eos> Egil the bastard.<eos> That's what they call you.
I'm so sorry.<eos> They say you are called Egil!<eos> Egil the bastard.<eos> That's what they call you.<eos> But you are neither Earl nor King.<eos> How could you could collect such an army?<eos> Who paid for your army,<eos> Egil the bastard?<eos> Why should I tell you?<eos> You will kill me, burn me alive, whether I tell you or not.
As you can see, I have no time for games.<eos> We found your wife.<eos> Look at her!<eos> We have told her that if you tell us who paid for your fleet and attack<eos> then we will spare your life.<eos> That you and your wife can live together again, happily.<eos> I don't know this woman.<eos> Just tell them.<eos> Just tell them, Egil!<eos> If I do it, it is for you.

I never loved him.<eos> I loved you.<eos> But people persuaded me.<eos> They lied to me.<eos> Can you understand?<eos> Your dream seemed a long time away.<eos> But I was wrong, so wrong, I should have waited!<eos> And now I see why.<eos> You are going to do exactly what you said you would do.<eos> And I should have believed you.
Is it any wonder that I've not slept?<eos> If such tragedies befall me while I wake,<eos> what kind of hell awaits me should I ever fall asleep?<eos> You have failed me for the last time, Monseur Marchal.<eos> I do not know that man.<eos> Would you have him tossed in jail, Sire, or in the nearest ditch ditch?<eos> Sire, when you were born, I was six years old.<eos> Hold your tongue!<eos> Let him speak!<eos> From that day to this, I have prayed that Almighty God would give me the chance to serve you.

I fear the King is deaf to warn.<eos> Tell him what he needs to know, not what he wants to hear.<eos> If we are carried all our lives, we soon forget how to walk.<eos> I do not understand why the King allowed it.<eos> A sign of weakness, perhaps?<eos> Magnanimity, strength.<eos> Cruel one moment, kind the very next.<eos> The winds of power are not constant.<eos> Now, let us talk of the future.<eos> How might I repay you?
The winds of power are not constant.<eos> Now, let us talk of the future.<eos> How might I repay you?<eos> With your loyalty.<eos> The courtyard is a ladder.<eos> Have you ever noticed that?<eos> But opportunity does not shine equally for all, but you can't believe you have the misfortune to be a woman.<eos> Thus, when my noble clients require a little help, I'm here.<eos> And there are many.<eos> How may I help you?

She already has you.
Avoid too much exertion.<eos> I'll spend my days in bed, then!<eos> You must be Father Etienne.<eos> And you must be the angel who aids these girls in their afflictions.<eos> I wouldn't call pregnancy an affliction.<eos> You take unwanted babies into care?<eos> Well, we have a small home for orphans near Saint-Denis, yes.<eos> They each receive food, a bed, an education, and are kept as far away as possible the sins of their mother.<eos> Well, I prefer errors.<eos> If only there were more like you.
He will, no doubt, dismiss my own account.<eos> but he can hardly question the word of a man of God.<eos> Very attractive, don't you think?<eos> As are it's contents.<eos> Fragrances?<eos> Of a sort, yes.<eos> Each is carefully crafted to induce certain feelings and pleasures.<eos> Whether you seek repose or stimulation, We have just the thing for you.<eos> Here, the perfect stimulus for a dreary day.<eos> Only 6,000, but for you...(five)

If I understand the details correctly, her motives were very clear and inapropriate towards someone Of The Cloth.<eos> They were of a sensuous nature.<eos> My King?<eos> Leave the matter with me.<eos> Is that how you seduce all the women?<eos> Did it work?<eos> You're still here.<eos> I like that.<eos> Did you miss me?<eos> If the King sees you...
I'm sorry, Philip.<eos> Destiny calls us to a greater mission.<eos> Perhaps His Majesty has forgotten.<eos> Whilst I appreciate my brother's bravery, I believe he is a winner of battles, not wars.<eos> I shall lead he attack on Holland.<eos> This is wonderful news, Sire!<eos> Your loyalty gives me great comfort.<eos> The question of Regent remains.<eos> Madame, I owe you an apology.<eos> My mother asked you for your help.
You gave it gladly and received, in return, a betrayal of that goodwill.<eos> Is that why you came here?<eos> To apologize?<eos> In part.<eos> I also came here because we have a common acquaintance.<eos> A curious woman, lives in the village.<eos> Sometimes goes by the name of Ariadne.<eos> You know her?<eos> Yes.<eos> And now she has asked me to help you.
With what?<eos> You tell me.<eos> Well, I cannot think what she meant.<eos> Do you know the Queen's new confessor? Father Pascal.<eos> I know his face and reputation.<eos> Perhaps we should take a turn in the garden.<eos> I hear the lilies are in bloom.<eos> You are here for confession, perhaps?<eos> No, I came here on a matter of some delicacy.<eos> I will help you in any way I can.
My son, you do not plan to take your own life?<eos> Not mine, no.<eos> Watch over me while I take my rest and deliver me from danger.<eos> May thy grace be with me always.<eos> Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> I admire your devotion.<eos> I know no greater love in this world.<eos> Will you pray for me, Madame, when I go to war?<eos> Sire, I pray for you everyday.
Do you want me to say what I think or what you want to hear?<eos> I think you're behaving like a child who always wants the toys other children have.<eos> Instead of sulking because your brother is king, you should be a king in your own right.<eos> He has an empire.<eos> Why can't you build an empire?<eos> He has a dynasty.<eos> Why can't you build a dynasty?<eos> You're my king.<eos> Knock, knock!<eos> I have found just the thing for you:
Perfect for hats, gloves and if you're that way inclined, underwear.<eos> Shall I come back later?<eos> Good idea!<eos> I see.<eos> Here I was looking for someone to declare war on, when the answer was right under my nose.<eos> In accordance with the laws of our kingdom, I, Louis XIV, King of France, solemnly confirm that in my absence for reasons of war, the Regency of France and all her possessions shall be placed in the hands of<eos> Maria Theresa of Austria, Queen of France,<eos> Queen Consort of Navarre.<eos> My mother performed the same role with distinction<eos> I know I can rely on you to do the same.
Queen Consort of Navarre.<eos> My mother performed the same role with distinction<eos> I know I can rely on you to do the same.<eos> I'll take you to the salon to effect some key introductions.<eos> Please allow me that honor? .<eos> Chevalier de Lorraine, may I present my niece, Isabelle.<eos> Isabelle...<eos> Le Chevalier, one of the court's most charming bachelors.<eos> I can see already, you will be a great success.<eos> I assure you, she is in safe hands.
Who knows?<eos> Isabelle and I have a very busy day ahead of us.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I am looking for some seeds.<eos> What kind of seeds?<eos> Akar Saga.<eos> Why that seed?<eos> I'm a student of the healing arts.<eos> No one can take from this plant.<eos> I cannot help you.
Yes, of course.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Help! Help!<eos> Help! Help!<eos> Get out of my way!<eos> Begone!<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Are you hurt, my dear?<eos> May I suggest that I help you out of here?
Help! Help!<eos> Get out of my way!<eos> Begone!<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Are you hurt, my dear?<eos> May I suggest that I help you out of here?<eos> Come on!<eos> Step aside!<eos> Out of my way!<eos> I believe this was intended for you, Majesty.

It was causing labor shortages.<eos> Dare I ask what they're planning instead?<eos> Total Rendition.<eos> I did everything that I could... we... we did everything that we could, but... the decision has come from above, so.<eos> Far above.<eos> How long do we have?<eos> It begins in six hours.<eos> Uh, would it be crass at this point in the conversation to ask what this all means for me?<eos> I'm being transitioned into a position with the Global Authority.<eos> I've carved out a place for you on my staff.
I'm Maddie Kenner.<eos> We know who you are.<eos> If you wish to begin atonement and recommit yourself to the faith, then you can wait in line with the others.<eos> Recommit?<eos> I'm a seventh level member.<eos> I founded this temple.<eos> The Greatest Day teaches us that humility is one of the key pillars in a life of service to our Hosts.<eos> Perhaps beginning your journey anew could set an example for others who have found themselves lost.<eos> Sir, a call just came in from Homeland's anti-terrorism tip line.<eos> They're asking for you specifically.

I said for you to come alone.<eos> He's here to prove I'm serious.<eos> Okay, I get it.<eos> You're serious.<eos> The truth.<eos> If we make a trade, do you have the juice to get us out of the bloc?<eos> Is the gauntlet here?<eos> - Course not.<eos> - Good.<eos> I want to come with you.
We sacrificed a lot for it.<eos> It'd be good to know it counted for something.<eos> We'll do everything we can.<eos> Come with us.<eos> The Occupation's gonna be tearing apart the bloc looking for me.<eos> I don't want to disappoint them.<eos> Take care of yourself.<eos> You too.<eos> Please maintain order as you enter the evacuation center, and have your identification cards ready for surrender.<eos> New documents will be issued to you at your final destination.
All right, move forward.<eos> Hold it right there.<eos> Are you the sergeant?<eos> Let me see your papers.<eos> Alan Snyder.<eos> As I'm sure your officer mentioned, I'm with the Governor-General's office.<eos> You know we're under evacuation protocol?<eos> That's exactly what I'm trying to do here.<eos> My orders are to escort these children out of the Colony.<eos> I'm no different than you, Sergeant.
It's the Governor-General's business, not yours.<eos> What are you... what are you doing?<eos> What... keep your mask on, Officer!<eos> Drop your weapon!<eos> Drop your weapon and raise your hands!<eos> - Drop it!<eos> - Put 'em down!<eos> You all know who we are.<eos> So you know how desperate we must be to try this.<eos> They didn't tell you what's happening, did they?
What... keep your mask on, Officer!<eos> Drop your weapon!<eos> Drop your weapon and raise your hands!<eos> - Drop it!<eos> - Put 'em down!<eos> You all know who we are.<eos> So you know how desperate we must be to try this.<eos> They didn't tell you what's happening, did they?<eos> Why they doubled up the shifts this morning.<eos> Or told you to seal the gateway and hold it no matter what you hear.
Radio the San Fernando gateway.<eos> If there's really an evacuation, they would be processing thousands of people already.<eos> Call them.<eos> Yeah, this is One-Victor-Five at the Downtown Gateway.<eos> Patch me through to San Fernando.<eos> There's no response.<eos> Try it again.<eos> I want a direct line.<eos> There's no one there.<eos> That's because they're lying to you.
The Queen asked to see me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> What services did she require?<eos> If she is with child, it must be an Immaculate Conception.<eos> Not my services, as such.<eos> So what did she want from you?<eos> To be my friend.<eos> It's not very subtle of her, is it?<eos> Please do not doubt my loyalty, Madame.<eos> My private knowledge of you shall remain so, I promise.
An historic agreement to be proud of.<eos> Just sign there, Sire.<eos> I'm sorry, does that mean it's 1,500 per day?<eos> We took many hours of negotiation to reach that figure, Sire.<eos> Well, it's too much.<eos> For that, we require exclusive access to the entire coastline and a portion of the profit.<eos> There is no point in landing the deal unless it makes financial sense to all parties involved.<eos> Remember, Sire, this is of great importance to all of France.<eos> This could affect the outcome of the war.<eos> I am grateful to you for considering this proposal but don't, for one second, think you can dictate terms to the King of France.
You know, you don't need any help to catch the King's eye.<eos> Don't be silly!<eos> Do you hasten to embroidery?<eos> To prayers, Madame.<eos> I cannot help but hear gossip.<eos> Excuse my friend's frivolity.<eos> You do not desire the King's favor?<eos> Every girl dreams of such a chance but I am too plain.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> But it takes a special devotion to please a King and skills a girl like you can only dream of.

I can't help you there.
And besides, she is no rival for the King's passion.<eos> There is someone younger who has designs on him.<eos> She will be beautiful but if she is cute, is she cunning?<eos> She is innocent like I once was.<eos> A woman must gain guile and wisdom as she loses youth.<eos> You must recognize what you are capable of and embrace it.<eos> That is when real power emerges.<eos> What if I am not strong enough?<eos> What if I fail?<eos> I have faith in you but the choice is yours.
Just relax and let it happen.<eos> Women are supposed to please, just like everywhere else.<eos> The pain is never as bad as the anticipation.<eos> I fear I may not be cut out for such things.<eos> There's no telling what delights the night will have in store.<eos> The only limit is your imagination.<eos> I learned from a young age, a girl just needs to know how to enjoy herself.<eos> Lord, our God We give thanks for our good King's victory against the enemies of our people and for your One Truth.<eos> I always dreamed of such gatherings.<eos> I wish to be like you, glamorous and free-spirited.
You just drink and you do powders until you feel nothing.<eos> This one's my favorite.<eos> You will love it.<eos> Your little plaything seems to be enjoying herself<eos> Indeed.<eos> Oh, her?<eos> Delightful little creature, if you like that sort of thing.<eos> You've never sampled a maiden?<eos> It used to be a hobby of mine before I discovered the real thing.<eos> Well, I would have thought she was quite the challenge, even for you.
If you'll excuse me.<eos> I had a few acqaintances over for prayer and it got a bit out of hand.<eos> Don't worry, we'll keep the noise down.<eos> You treat this as a joke?<eos> You made me King.<eos> I have every right to do as I please in my own rooms.<eos> You cannot legislate for what happens behind closed doors.<eos> The King will take great exception to this display of contempt.<eos> He'll understand.<eos> I've known him a lot longer than you.
Previously on Vikings...<eos> You took my husband, my world, and my happiness.<eos> I renounce everything.<eos> Where's our mother?<eos> She's dead, Ubbe. This was nothing to do with you.
Yes. Ragnar and I were alike in many ways.<eos> I trusted him. - He trusted me.<eos> - I'm not talking about Ragnar. I'm talking about his son.<eos> Ivar?<eos> - He's a cripple.<eos> - He's a Viking! You made a huge mistake releasing him.<eos> - Don't say that.<eos> - It's true. I mean, don't contradict your father.<eos> I care about your father, and I believe in him.<eos> Yes, I know you do, and I can never totally express my gratitude to you.
I've come here for justice.<eos> Everyone knows that you killed my mother for no reason, except ambition.<eos> Therefore, I demand justice.<eos> - Ivar... - Don't touch me, coward.<eos> He is not a coward.<eos> But perhaps he understands some things that you don't.<eos> I understand everything perfectly.<eos> You murdered my mother in cold blood.<eos> I want revenge.<eos> I challenge you to single combat.
Say something interesting.<eos> You heard what he said, how the little pigs will grunt when they hear how the old boar suffered.<eos> So now we're grunting.<eos> So what?<eos> We want blood-revenge against Aelle?<eos> - Not only against Aelle.<eos> I told you,<eos> King Ecbert offered our father up like a sacrifice, so we'll do the same thing to him.<eos> That is what Father wanted.<eos> That is the message that he wanted me to bring to you.
I know very well what happened to Kattegat, Lagertha.<eos> We are going to raise an army to invade England and avenge the death of our father.<eos> Will you come with us?<eos> Would you really want me to come with you?<eos> We will need all the help we can get.<eos> After all, don't you have a reason?<eos> I also have a reason to stay here.<eos> I understand you are inviting other rulers to come and join your army.<eos> Don't you think some of them will be envious when they see the size and understand the value of this trading station?<eos> It depends, I suppose, on what is more important to you.
You would say that, wouldn't you?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> You tell me.<eos> All right, I will, Mommy's boy.<eos> Mommy's little favorite!<eos> Are you just really sad she can't breastfeed you anymore, is that it?<eos> Whoever would have thought that you two were brothers?<eos> To what do we owe the honor of your visit?<eos> I wanted to see my family.<eos> I also wanted to warn you.
I have no wish or need to be allied to such a degenerate monarch.<eos> Daughter, we are all aware of your immoral relationship with your father-in-law.<eos> It grieves us deeply.<eos> We pray that you will return to your wedded husband and behave as a Christian wife ought to behave.<eos> I am grateful for your concern, Mother. But there is no need to pray for me.<eos> If we do not pray for your soul, daughter, then you will be damned for all eternity.<eos> If I am to hell, at least I will enjoy the company of my degenerate monarch.<eos> Judith!<eos> Blasphemous girl!<eos> As for you, Father, you may enjoy the aridities of heaven without my discomforting presence, and that of every other woman whose only crime was a desire to be free.
And you, Hvitserk.<eos> Too much bad blood, Rollo.<eos> Once a betrayer, always a betrayer.<eos> Goodbye, Rollo.<eos> Goodbye, Helga.<eos> I won't forget.<eos> I won't forget anything.<eos> You should have killed him when you had the chance.<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> Because I have a bad feeling that he will reach more fame than any of you.
And act on them!<eos> Is this the place?<eos> This is the pit where Ragnar died.<eos> Yes. Thank God.<eos> Just in this place. Just here.<eos> This is where the pagan died.<eos> Then it is a sacred place.<eos> How dare you say such things?<eos> - Are you mad?<eos> - I may be. But since I love some of you, I urge you again to take heed of my warning.
We have come a long way to see you. But it is a short distance to meet the famous shield-maiden, Queen Lagertha, and the sons of Ragnar Lothbrok.<eos> Ragnar and I were simple farmers. I had no idea our fame had spread so far.<eos> Are you joking?<eos> It is almost tiresome to hear the poets talk of all your exploits.<eos> I'm sorry it was tiresome. Perhaps we should have done things a more interesting way.<eos> No, no, no. That is the fault of the poets, not you.<eos> And who is this?<eos> This is Torvi, my son Bjorn's companion.<eos> And this is Astrid, one of my shield-maidens.<eos> I leave you in their company.
Bjorn should be leader.<eos> Then it's settled.<eos> What did you say to Margrethe?<eos> Uh...<eos> I told her that I've always loved her.<eos> But I understood you had first claim to her.<eos> Queen Lagertha.<eos> Princess Ellisif from Denmark.<eos> Princess Ellisif.<eos> I'm surprised to see you.
Princess Ellisif from Denmark.<eos> Princess Ellisif.<eos> I'm surprised to see you.<eos> Why?<eos> Hasn't the whole world come to kattegat?<eos> Can it be you have forgotten?<eos> Of course I haven't forgotten.<eos> You saw me, but you did not bother to come and say hello.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I wanted to marry you.

I'm already married.<eos> To whom are you married, my beauty?<eos> Him?<eos> Is he a king?<eos> No.<eos> He's...<eos> An Earl in Denmark.<eos> An Earl?<eos> Yes.<eos> But I was already a king and I was not good enough for you.
Yes.<eos> But I was already a king and I was not good enough for you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You keep saying that.<eos> You're so sorry.<eos> But the point is...<eos> You told me you would wait and marry me when I become very...<eos> Important.<eos> But in the meantime, you marry a nobody!<eos> I have built my entire life around you.

Everything I have done, I have done for you, and the gods.<eos> I have dedicated my life to you.<eos> Please, no!<eos> I love you.<eos> Please don't kill me.<eos> Please.<eos> Who gives this woman away to her new husband?<eos> I do.<eos> And so I name you man and wife.<eos> And may the gods bless you,
You know the rules of the race, brother.<eos> You have to serve the feast.<eos> Are you going with the army?<eos> Of course.<eos> I have to avenge Ragnar.<eos> He loved me.<eos> But you should stay here with Tanaruz.<eos> You have new responsibilities now.<eos> No.<eos> We are coming with you.
You have new responsibilities now.<eos> No.<eos> We are coming with you.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes, we are a family now.<eos> Whatever happens, we must be together.<eos> But the girl still isn't eating properly.<eos> She doesn't seem settled or happy.<eos> It is you that is not happy, floki.<eos> Something happened to you in Algeciras and you have not been the same.
Come here, boy!<eos> My horn is empty.<eos> Mine too!<eos> Egil...<eos> You have seen all you needed to?<eos> Enough to know they are not as safe and secure as they think they are.<eos> Go and make your plans.<eos> We wait to hear of your success, Earl egil.<eos> You should have killed Ellisif when you had the chance.<eos> She dishonored you.
We all wanted her and just because I'm the oldest...<eos> I know that you like each other.<eos> I can see.<eos> So...<eos> What do you think, hvitserk?<eos> I think that you should ask Margrethe.<eos> You're talking about sharing me?<eos> Yes.<eos> How can you not be jealous?<eos> Either of you?
How can you not be jealous?<eos> Either of you?<eos> Both of you?<eos> Because we are vikings.<eos> Let's see if it's true.<eos> Come on, then.<eos> This is my marriage night.<eos> Let's go to bed.<eos> Brother!<eos> I envy you!
But I am the leader of this great army.<eos> Me!<eos> And you will obey me.<eos> And if you do so, my brothers, revenge for our father...<eos> Will be ours.<eos> - You came to say goodbye?<eos> - It is time.<eos> Take care of Kattegat.<eos> Farewell, my son.<eos> Again, I place you in the hands of the gods.

I'm listening.<eos> This is the army which has come to revenge the death of Ragnar Lothbrok.<eos> And it's all your fault.<eos> How is it all his fault?<eos> He freed Ragnar's son.<eos> Who would have told them everything.<eos> Who would have told them that we gave Ragnar Lothbrok to king Aelle to be killed.<eos> Sometimes, god does things to test us.<eos> This has nothing to do with god!<eos> This has to do with you.

Please, tell me...<eos> What kind of a father are you?<eos> You're not behaving like a king anymore.<eos> People are already talking about it.<eos> You're distracted, you're withdrawn.<eos> You seem unsure, and hesitant, when once you were firm, you were strong.<eos> Oh, I am filled with doubts.<eos> And I've begun to believe that being firm and strong was the illusion and that I am unsure now because it is the most honest way to be.<eos> Not in the face of a great heathen army that are come to destroy us.<eos> That is why I have placed you in command of our armies.

Versailles was dying, and I was dying with it.<eos> And the person ,who had been my companion for so long, was blinding me to my true purpose.<eos> His Majesty is weary, perhaps.<eos> I would be alone.<eos> Solange, please close the door.<eos> No doubt, the war has taken it's toll and he is in need of rest.<eos> He was in good spirits?<eos> Indeed.<eos> The King's thrown himself back into matters of state and the construction of the palace.<eos> Well, no doubt, he was delighted to see you.
Indeed.<eos> The King's thrown himself back into matters of state and the construction of the palace.<eos> Well, no doubt, he was delighted to see you.<eos> Solange, please ask the maid to prepare my bath.<eos> Of course, Madame.<eos> He loves me and I will give him the attention and affection that he needs.<eos> Of course.<eos> Your Majesty must be tired, after such a long journey.<eos> Tired, yet reinvigorated.<eos> When I last saw you, Sire, you seemed...
I'm not sure I understand, Sire.<eos> Do whatever is necessary!<eos> You requested my presence, Sire?<eos> Follow me, gentlemen.<eos> France is sullied by events here at the Palace, by our reverses in Holland.<eos> I want the people of France to see their King and country in a better light.<eos> Whatever setbacks we may suffer in the war, they will read of nothing but epic victories and I want you to describe them.<eos> trumpet them to the world with every fine phrase and heroic simile at your disposal.<eos> Sire, if I may...<eos> Look around you, gentlemen.
What is this for?<eos> Urine, Your Highness.<eos> Of course.<eos> Your staring at me is not making this any easier.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Wine.<eos> Well?<eos> Yer Highness is pregnant!<eos> Congratulations!<eos> My heartfelt congratulations to you both.
No.<eos> A very sad affair.<eos> Despite several reminders from his creditors, he refused to pay his debt.<eos> The King was informed, sentenced him to 10 years in prison.<eos> I thought you should know.<eos> If it isn't France's favorite couple!<eos> On the right, the Duke d'Orleans, sporting a delicious spring outfit and on the left, looking in fine fettle...<eos> My wife is pregnant.<eos> The King!<eos> Look at me, each and every one of you.
I will speak with him alone.<eos> Why did you bury her here?<eos> She used to walk here, as a child, studying the plants and flowers.<eos> I'm sorry for her death.<eos> I wish I could have done something.<eos> You could have.<eos> Who killed her?<eos> She was investigating the poisons being used at the palace.<eos> She must have discovered something she was not meant to.<eos> I need you.
They must be stopped once and for all.<eos> They can be and they shall be, Sire, but on one condition.<eos> That I trust your judgment?<eos> Yes, Sire.<eos> I have always trusted your judgement.<eos> It was my own that fell by the wayside.<eos> The King is easily influenced.<eos> We must act quickly, before she twists his mind back in her favor.<eos> What does Her Majesty propose?<eos> He listens neither to you nor to me.
I want nothing more in the world than to see my friend happy.<eos> However, it is my belief that intimate relations between a man and a woman should remain within the confines of marriage.<eos> I believe you decision's for the best.<eos> For God, for her and for His Majesty.<eos> I hope this is important.<eos> You know how much I hate mornings.<eos> Please, you have to talk to him.<eos> Why me?<eos> Because you suffer at his hands as much as I do.<eos> He forced you to marry for politics, he rejects me to please the Church and you are the only person that he will listen to.
I fail to see what argument could possibly change his mind.<eos> Love is stronger than any argument, is it not?<eos> My brother seems more guided by duty than love or argument these days.<eos> Of course.<eos> I have decided to set up a new trading company in the East Indies.<eos> I personally will invest 3 million pounds in the company.<eos> The rest, we shall sell as shares, to the value of one million each.<eos> Very wise, Your Majesty.<eos> As for trade within France, the Crown will receive a 10% import fee on all goods brought into the country and 40% of the transportation tariffs from the Canal du Midi.<eos> Something bothers you?
No doubt, you were praying that I'd been torn apart by a Dutch cannonball.<eos> Hope springs eternal.<eos> Now then, I trust you have some useful information for me?<eos> I do not.<eos> And yet i happen to know, you were in the presence of the King just this morning.<eos> The answer is no and will remain no.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I'm no longer in ac ondition to fulfill my duties as a Minister.<eos> Well, I have decided to spend the rest of my days in quiet repose.<eos> Need I remind you, dear friend, that should you betray me to the King, I will find out and then I will kill you!

He was most insistent, Sire, that we all be present.<eos> This really is highly irregular!<eos> Well, this is hardly the first time he could be accused of that.<eos> Your Majesty, I have sinned against you.<eos> For five years, I was part of a conspiracy to have you overthrown.<eos> Why do you tell me this?<eos> Because you did me the honor of trusting me when others did not. and I wish to show my gratitude.<eos> And why now?<eos> I'm tired, Sire.<eos> No longer fit to serve you.
I'm tired, Sire.<eos> No longer fit to serve you.<eos> You realize I should have you executed for this?<eos> I trust His Majesty to do what is just and right<eos> But I have no plans to leave the palace.<eos> I can be found in my rooms.<eos> One more thing:<eos> Your historian, Thomas.<eos> What of him?<eos> He knew of my involvement in the plot against you.
I have no taste for titles and such things.<eos> You soon will have.<eos> Gaston De Foix's newfound wealth, where does it come from?<eos> well, certainly not the gambling tables.<eos> His losses this month have come into thousands, though he has always payed on time.<eos> By the way, I encountered a friend of yours, yesterday in Paris.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, who was that?<eos> Goes by the name of Hector.<eos> Well dressed, well spoken, a grave manner, spitting image of you, in fact.
I have not yet found the opportunity.<eos> You must be patient.<eos> I cannot be patient.<eos> I know him.<eos> If I wait, he will find another, but not your equal.<eos> But you agree.<eos> He will find someone else.<eos> This is the first time...<eos> What?<eos> ...that I've see you like this.
This is the first time...<eos> What?<eos> ...that I've see you like this.<eos> Not the cold and distant goddess that breaks every man's heart and strikes fear into everyone in the salon but but soft, human, vulnerable.<eos> And broken.<eos> Go and see him.<eos> Confront him.<eos> Tell him your feelings.<eos> You're wasting your time, waiting and hoping.<eos> If he accepts you back, then you have reaped the rewards of your courage.
Say it!<eos> Say it!<eos> I do not love you.<eos> You're a liar!<eos> You did the right thing, coming to see me.<eos> I do not have anyone else.<eos> You say it is the Church that has persuaded the King to renounce his love for you?<eos> Yes.<eos> You have beauty, wit, intelligence, yet none of these have proved strong enough to retain the King's love.<eos> Only one course remains open to you.
His name is Guibourg.<eos> Who is he?<eos> He's a friend and he sees the world as we do.<eos> Where shall I find him?<eos> Monsieur Guibourg?<eos> Yes?<eos> I need your help.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I am the Marquise de Montespan.<eos> And how may I help you?
I don't recognize you anymore.<eos> You stay away from me!<eos> He missed... the story of his life.<eos> Go away!<eos> Go away!<eos> Dig it up.<eos> All of it.<eos> I'm at prayer, Bontemps.<eos> Sire, I insist you come with me.<eos> Monseur Louvois awaits you in the Council Room.
Maybe that's your true legacy.<eos> You don't want to be loved.<eos> You want to be feared.<eos> Why am I still being tortured?<eos> I cannot say, Sire.<eos> I crushed all carnal thoughts, I acknowledged my errors, yet still, God is punishing me with this massacre!<eos> I've done everything in my power to please him.<eos> What else can I do?<eos> To pray is the only solution, Sire.<eos> All answers will come to you through Him.
I cannot talk now, I have matinees.<eos> God can wait.<eos> I'm here on behalf of the King.<eos> Tell me about the Church's refuge, St. Genevieve, An institution for lost souls.<eos> They take the children of whores.<eos> Such charity is misplaced.<eos> Sinners must pay their own debts.<eos> The Church has no such place.<eos> How can you be sure?<eos> Because I have authority over all France. That includes you.
I wish to become a better lover for my husband.<eos> The profound love of wedlock can only come through God, Majesty.<eos> How would you characterize your marriage?<eos> My late husband was very busy with his work.<eos> He wasn't one for physical prowess.<eos> Although, occasionally, my husband seemed to find me irresistible, after I bathed in aromatic oils.<eos> Aromatic oils?<eos> I beg your pardon, Your Majesty.<eos> Solange, that won't be necessary.<eos> Indeed, I have a favor to ask of you.
So, may I have my servant back?<eos> That's a distinctive brocade.<eos> Yes, I'll give you the name of my tailor, if you could afford him.<eos> I prefer a less tawdry cut.<eos> Some of us were born to set fashions, others merely to follow them<eos> Come along, Odile.<eos> Are you spying on me?<eos> I thought you were my friend!<eos> And this is how you betray me?<eos> Everything I know of treachery, I learned from you!
What's happened to her?<eos> I cannot say.<eos> Tell me where he can be found.<eos> Will it suffice?<eos> So long as it contains it's essence, yes.<eos> You must cover your skin with half of this at daybreak, the other half at dusk.<eos> And ingest nothing but this tincture, in advance.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> I don't know if I can do this.<eos> I would not have invested in your future if I did not believe in you.
With your help, I will confront my foes and bring the enemies of your Kingdom to justice.<eos> But I need your help.<eos> Do I have it?<eos> Do I have it?<eos> Horses!<eos> Keep our distance.<eos> I gave orders not to be disturbed.<eos> I came to pray, Your Highness.<eos> What do you pray for?<eos> For you.
I'm in no need of prayer.<eos> I disagree.<eos> You need it more than anyone.<eos> You carry all our hopes, our desires, our dreams.<eos> I also lead a gilded life, don't I?<eos> I have everything in tha world a man could ever want.<eos> Bring the heart of France is a terrible burden.<eos> You must be stronger than all of us.<eos> But if I can't find the strength?<eos> God will help you.
Do you agree to serve the Lord?<eos> I do.<eos> Gather round!<eos> You helped me find my strength.<eos> You carry your responsibilities like a cross.<eos> As King, I must carry the sins of all my people.<eos> That was the sacrifice of Our Lod.<eos> He does want me to follow Him, doesn't He?<eos> Yes.<eos> But He does not ask you to become Him.
But one of his disciples spoke.<eos> It seems the priest had accomplices in the village.<eos> Chief among them, a woman.<eos> Extract their names from him and show him the full force of my justice.<eos> Oh, my child, my poor child!<eos> I was dreaming.<eos> What?<eos> I was dreaming.<eos> I sold my soul!<eos> Our Lord will protect you.
Our Lord will protect you.<eos> He is your master.<eos> And what of Father Etienne?<eos> Monseur Marchal and his men took him.<eos> What if they saw where I went?<eos> No, he's never betrayed any of his followers.<eos> Then he's never met Monseur Marchal.<eos> We must have faith in him.<eos> What do I do now?<eos> After the way the King has betrayed you, don't tell me you do not seek justice.
It's about the Princess Palatine.<eos> She's been in mourning since the loss of her countrymen.<eos> I'm sure it's simply an oversight but a few words from His Majesty might ease her pain.<eos> You're right.<eos> I shall express my deepest regrets.<eos> Yes.<eos> That is not what you had in mind.<eos> I think you should ask her forgiveness.<eos> Confession is not the same as apology.<eos> Why don't my priests be like you?
I only believe in the here and now.<eos> And right now, there is only you and me, Seron.<eos> Who else is behind this abomination?<eos> I give you nothing!<eos> I imagine, you can appreciate the significance.<eos> Oh, yes!<eos> Just as I appreciate your insignificance!<eos> My prince is all-powerful.<eos> Yes.<eos> It appears that your Lord has forsaken you.
- Hey!<eos> - Scarab, stop.<eos> Control that thing, Beetle, or I'll control it for you.<eos> You're going to have a sword fight in here?<eos> How about some place roomier... - ... like a broom closet?<eos> - Everyone, calm down.<eos> The enemy is above us.<eos> You have to channel all your thoughts to that.<eos> Remember, these opponents are different.<eos> Uh, as Kori will tell you.
How about some place roomier... - ... like a broom closet?<eos> - Everyone, calm down.<eos> The enemy is above us.<eos> You have to channel all your thoughts to that.<eos> Remember, these opponents are different.<eos> Uh, as Kori will tell you.<eos> No, keep going.<eos> I've been studying them since I left the Titans.<eos> They're zealots, extremists.<eos> They'll sacrifice themselves without hesitation to get to you.
I better go too.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's just...<eos> I miss my son.<eos> Accessing most recent footage on Brother Blood.<eos> Lies.<eos> My church is a holy place and we strive only to do good.<eos> Come now, Brother Blood.<eos> Isn't your church just a glorified cult?<eos> Unlike you, Bryce, I believe in an America where all beliefs should be treated with respect.
What?<eos> - Hey, anyone seen Jaime?<eos> - Yeah, he's right there.<eos> - Something is wrong.<eos> - Yeah, there is. He's about to be crushed at foosball.<eos> You wanna come see?<eos> Buzz off.<eos> Maybe you should go.<eos> Might be good to have two of you down there.<eos> And I say to you. Those who deny the chosen have no place in the Eden that shall be built.
The center.<eos> My parents volunteer for the one in my town.<eos> - And...<eos> - Maybe I should volunteer.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> We're Titans.<eos> We don't serve soup.<eos> You don't have to move a mountain to help people, Terra.<eos> Besides, I gotta find a way to make the bug more comfortable around humans.<eos> - Can I help you?
I'm okay, so, get going.<eos> You heard me.<eos> Get going.<eos> You too, Greeny.<eos> - Does that happen a lot?<eos> - It happens enough.<eos> - What did you see? - Nothing.<eos> And if I did see anything, it wouldn't be your business.<eos> Everything that goes on in the tower is my business.<eos> Just like it should be for all of you.

Told you everyone was your enemy.<eos> Trained you, ruthlessly.<eos> And promised you exactly what you wanted.<eos> Believe me, I know.<eos> I've always hated you.<eos> You and all the others.<eos> The Titans treated you like family.<eos> And you threw it all away.<eos> Stop.<eos> Can't I leave you for two minutes?
Yeah, the machine's doing that.<eos> But I'm the one who put you here.<eos> Deathstroke.<eos> What have you done to Robin?<eos> I beat the crap out of him for being mouthy.<eos> Come on, you've all had the urge.<eos> Once I get out, I'm gonna break you into little bits.<eos> It's good to have goals, ese.<eos> Me, I'm having waffles after you're dead.<eos> By the way, can I introduce you to my assistant?
You will die!<eos> You cannot harm...<eos> No, you stay away from me.<eos> You demon filth.<eos> They're not demons.<eos> Let me show you one.<eos> What the hell?<eos> I planned so long.<eos> I was destined, can't you see?<eos> Please, I beseech you.
When an ASA wins his or her first felony trial, a piece of something they were wearing when the verdict came in goes up on the wall.<eos> There's a piece of a bra up there.<eos> What can I say?<eos> Second chair always picks the item.<eos> You're telling me someone here actually wore a bowtie?<eos> Yeah, well, I lost a bet.<eos> Patrol saw her body floating in the water.<eos> Summons to appear for jury duty was in her wallet.<eos> CPD ID'd her. They called us.<eos> We called you.
- The restaurant app?<eos> - Among others.<eos> We're looking at a high-tech stalker.<eos> Here's the last text message:<eos> "It's either the jury or your kid.<eos> Last chance."<eos> Best day of my life was when I met Lily.<eos> Worst?<eos> Well, when she dumped me.<eos> We wanted to ask you about a bunch of texts you sent her.
Come on. Let's go.<eos> Put the phones away.<eos> Lily Jane Spencer was brought in for an OD.<eos> Klonopin?<eos> She washed a handful down with a bottle of wine.<eos> Do you think she was trying to kill herself?<eos> It says here she spoke to one of our psychiatrists...<eos> Or, rather, he tried to speak to her.<eos> She wasn't too talkative.<eos> I'll tell you what: this lady was lucky someone found her in time and called 911.
We can start with over 1,500 harassing and threatening texts in three months.<eos> Two years.<eos> Take it or leave it.<eos> It's not my fault Lily finally got it right.<eos> You knew about Lily's first suicide attempt?<eos> - Yeah. Yeah, she called me, crying.<eos> Waah, waah, like a... Like a pathetic goat.<eos> Next thing I know, her lesbo sister's blaming me because Lily went full Whitney Houston in the bathtub.<eos> You should've taken the two years, Mr. Clark.<eos> Now I'm charging you with Lily's murder.
No. If he does it once, in isolation, of course not.<eos> Could it be written?<eos> Like in an email or a text?<eos> Yes. What's critical in these cases is the repetition of the criticism... the insult or blame.<eos> At a certain point, the victim goes from being simply humiliated to suffering diminished dignity.<eos> Her self-worth and her self-confidence are utterly destroyed.<eos> Is it possible that such a victim becomes suicidal?<eos> Without self-worth, why go on?<eos> You're doing important work, Dr. Cole.<eos> I applaud you for it.
I instructed you on how to apply the law regarding murder.<eos> Yes, I detest this defendant.<eos> He did what he did, and a woman may have died because of it.<eos> But "may have" is not good enough.<eos> You rendered a decision based purely on emotion.<eos> Sit down, Mr. Stone.<eos> You ignored my instructions completely, and now you force me to ignore your decision.<eos> - Your Honor, I...<eos> - I said sit, Mr. Stone.<eos> Unlike you, I actually listened to the testimony.
Nobody I know, I hope.<eos> A college friend.<eos> Corra.<eos> Her boyfriend, Rhys, he...<eos> He did a real number on her.<eos> And I didn't do anything.<eos> The law's got to change, Mark.<eos> Then change it.<eos> Good morning, senators.<eos> I'm here to speak to you about the Illinois Murder Statute, specifically how it should include a situation in which one person, using emotional abuse, causes another to commit suicide.

Can't you just wait a little while before calling it in?<eos> - Please, please.<eos> - Okay, five minutes.<eos> Five minutes?<eos> Forget it.<eos> Cheryl, don't... No. No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Wait.<eos> What if he's still out there?<eos> I'll be all right.<eos> Neither one of you can shoot anyhow.
No. No, it's not.<eos> But maybe losing that ring would be a shock for you in a... in a good way.<eos> You suggesting' I forget about Miranda?<eos> Never.<eos> Good.<eos> But forgetting about someone is not the same thing as moving on, as evolving, and I think you should allow for the possibility...<eos> All right.<eos> As usual, this has been a blast. Thanks, though.<eos> - This has been real helpful.<eos> - I'm sorry if I upset you, Riggs.
Easy, tough guy.<eos> Look, I'm a cop.<eos> I just want to ask you a few questions.<eos> Show me your badge then.<eos> Ain't nothing there, man.<eos> All right.<eos> It's probably in the car.<eos> Man, just take my word for it and lower the weapon.<eos> No way.<eos> Yeah, but then I'm gonna have to take it from you.
Turn off the cameras and recorders in there.<eos> - I need to spend some alone time with my client.<eos> So Trish is his attorney and mentor.<eos> Listen, if we're gonna be partners, one of us better start paying attention when people are talking.<eos> Turn 'em off.<eos> We said we'd never meet like this again.<eos> And I didn't do anything.<eos> Ooh, I want to believe you, Dino.<eos> Mrs. Murtaugh, you have known me since I was 15 years old.<eos> I would not lie to you.

He was at home all night with me... watching TV.<eos> Yeah? What were you watching?<eos> A Lakers' game.<eos> They were off.<eos> I meant to say the Clippers.<eos> Who were they playing?<eos> I can't remember.<eos> What were you doing after the game?<eos> We went to sleep.<eos> All right, listen, Jerry. If your brother actually cared about you, he wouldn't put you in this position.
- I will count that as progress.<eos> - Perfect.<eos> I want you to put that in your file, tell Avery I'm cured, and I'll get out of your hair.<eos> Take it easy, Doc.<eos> Okay, here's the game plan.<eos> A car dealership is a man's domain, so no one talks but me.<eos> Great.<eos> I've been waiting to hear you talk all day.<eos> Guys, not here.<eos> This isn't about you.
You'll live.<eos> You better.<eos> Hi, Mrs. Murtaugh.<eos> Dino, the police have new evidence.<eos> They know you're innocent.<eos> You should come down and talk to 'em.<eos> That's good to hear.<eos> Thanks.<eos> But I'm kind of in the middle of something.<eos> Call you tomorrow.
You know what, I should be going in there with you guys.<eos> Well, if you'd like to trade places with me and deal with Trish, we can arrange that.<eos> No.<eos> We better stick to the plan.<eos> You've done this before, yeah?<eos> Yeah. I lost a bet one time at a demolition derby outside of El Paso.<eos> - You mean drug busts? - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, tons.<eos> I still think I should be<eos> - in there with you.
Everybody makes their own decisions.<eos> Nothing you could do about that.<eos> He's not cut out for prison, though.<eos> They're gonna eat him up in there.<eos> If he testifies against Angelo, I'll cut him a deal with the D.A.<eos> He will.<eos> You have my word.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I feel like I let you down.

But you have to know where to put it.<eos> Giving a school guard a black eye is... short-sighted.<eos> You get kicked out, then what?<eos> No education, no prospects.<eos> Doubt you could do much for your sister if you can't even take care of yourself.<eos> To really protect people... you need power.<eos> This place is the first step in getting it.<eos> It's not too late to do the right thing.<eos> Ma'am...<eos> Colonel Nix is ready for you.
There is no Genesis 3:25, but this morning, one of my systems picked up the phrase "Genesis 3:25"<eos> over some chatter, and I was able to track it to a man named Jared Wisnewski.<eos> Single guy, runs a local farmers co-op upstate.<eos> A few hunting rifles registered to his name.<eos> Okay, so a mild-mannered farmer references a Bible verse that doesn't exist in the chatter?<eos> - Barely a lead.<eos> - I thought so, too.<eos> But the coincidence didn't sit well with Weller, and he wanted us to dig into it.<eos> How exactly did this alert your tattoo database?<eos> I don't want to bore you with the intricate details.
That's Ellen Briggs.<eos> What was her connection to the academy?<eos> Ellen was in the Army.<eos> She visited once a semester to talk about her work serving abroad.<eos> Spent a lot of time in Africa, the Middle East.<eos> And she took a real interest in you.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, I was... this close to kicking you out of here, and Ellen convinced me you deserved another chance.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> She convinced you?
People can't make a living anymore.<eos> Agent Boyd was concerned that the anti-government sentiment could lead to a homegrown domestic cell.<eos> He wanted me to keep an eye on things, report back.<eos> I identified a few key people that were angrier than others<eos> - and passed those names along.<eos> - All right.<eos> So, how does passing on a few names turn into a terror attack?<eos> It was Boyd's idea.<eos> Come again?<eos> Are you saying an agent told you to start building ANFO bombs?
- Yeah, because it's against the law.<eos> These people would not be planning this attack if you hadn't have given them the idea.<eos> I'm just moving up the timeline on the inevitable.<eos> These people are angry.<eos> They hate the government.<eos> Yeah, and that does not make them criminals.<eos> Look, if we don't root out this kind of stuff now, we'll be dealing with the aftermath later.<eos> Think about Ruby Ridge,<eos> Cliven Bundy, Timothy McVeigh.<eos> I'm shutting you down, Boyd.
Stay sharp, team.<eos> Anything seems off, we move in, make the arrests.<eos> - Copy?<eos> - Copy that.<eos> How the hell did the FBI know to raid your farm, Jared?<eos> Nosy neighbor.<eos> I'm just lucky I wasn't home when they stormed the place.<eos> They got the weapons and the bombs.<eos> They could know everything.<eos> Nothing pointed to our plan or to any of you.
I'm sure of it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Go!<eos> We're evacuating the building, but getting 50 floors of people out of here<eos> - takes time.<eos> - I've got it.<eos> - Where's the bomb squad?<eos> - They're doing a sweep.<eos> So far, nothing, but, you know, they've got a lot of ground to cover and not enough agents yet.<eos> We'll help you with evacuation.
I can understand you're frustrated, but there has to be a line.<eos> You know it.<eos> So, we will find them, and we'll make them pay, but it can't be at the cost of compromising yourself.<eos> - I'll disconnect Omaha from my systems.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> But there's something you should know before I pull the plug.<eos> - What did I just say?<eos> - It's about Sean Clark.<eos> I ran his name through Omaha, and I got a hit on an archived wiretap, a recorded phone conversation from last year.<eos> Sean Clark, wonderful to hear from you.
Sean Clark, wonderful to hear from you.<eos> It's been a while, Assistant Director Mayfair.<eos> - Holding things down in New York for us?<eos> - Trying my best.<eos> - Why would Mayfair and Clark be talking?<eos> - Just listen.<eos> Look, I'm calling about the agent you put up to run the DC office.<eos> He's the best I've got.<eos> I think it's a little premature for him to be a candidate.<eos> He should spend some more time with you in New York before taking over an office of his own.
- The press called him a,<eos> "multi-murderer."<eos> And the hotel he built was an elaborate death trap.<eos> Trapdoors, acid vats, torture racks... he'd even dissect them sometimes.<eos> But you know all this, Lucy, don't you?<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Do you work here?<eos> - Can I help you?
Okay, they're locked.<eos> And the curtain, please.<eos> Thank you, thank you.<eos> And please, tell your friends about the great Houdini.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That was amazing.<eos> It was so good.<eos> - Thanks for your help.<eos> - You were amazing.<eos> I have to tell you, I...
I'm very interested.<eos> - He's right outside.<eos> Would you like to meet him now?<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> - Right this way.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I am really, really, sorry.<eos> Mr. Houdini.<eos> A pleasure.<eos> I don't know what she's told you, but I don't have any money.
Thank you.<eos> I am really, really, sorry.<eos> Mr. Houdini.<eos> A pleasure.<eos> I don't know what she's told you, but I don't have any money.<eos> We don't need your money.<eos> We need you to pick a lock.<eos> I think he's coming to.<eos> It's all right! It's all right!<eos> I'm not trying to hurt you!
You weren't kidding.<eos> Edison really is paranoid.<eos> - Can you open it?<eos> - It'll take some time.<eos> - Ten minutes maybe.<eos> - You got three.<eos> Those Pinkertons will be back soon.<eos> I have another idea.<eos> That tiny thing is a bomb?<eos> What did Edison ever do to you?
- You got three.<eos> Those Pinkertons will be back soon.<eos> I have another idea.<eos> That tiny thing is a bomb?<eos> What did Edison ever do to you?<eos> Well, I guess the meeting wasn't at 4:00 after all.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - Mr. Edison, Mr. Ford.<eos> Mr. Morgan.<eos> Rare pleasure to meet you.
It's a sleight of hand.<eos> It's called The Cutpurse.<eos> What the hell is going on, young man?<eos> Guards!<eos> Gentlemen, if I were you, I'd vacate this fair city as quickly as possible.<eos> By the way... you've just been saved... by the great Harry Houdini.<eos> See my show if you can.<eos> Mentioning The Cutpurse to me... that was pretty smart.<eos> I was hoping you'd get what I meant.<eos> That's why I came to you... so you would help me.
I dropped off the face of the Earth.<eos> I know what that's like... to have someone missing.<eos> Not knowing, always wondering.<eos> That's the worst part.<eos> But I'm not gonna let that happen.<eos> You understand me?<eos> You're gonna go home to your father... you, your son.<eos> But I need you to help me.<eos> Police are downstairs.<eos> I'm telling you, these joints... they're impossible.
- Thank you.<eos> - Yeah, of course.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We should probably get going before someone realizes we're gone.<eos> He's right.<eos> We should get out of here.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Lucy.<eos> We're not done here yet.<eos> I told you, I'm not H.H. Holmes.
Be quiet.<eos> Escape.<eos> Fear isn't real.<eos> Escape.<eos> If I'm going to burn in hell, you're going to burn with me.<eos> I wouldn't do that if I were you, Herman Mudgett.<eos> I'm not like the other women.<eos> And there have been so many women, haven't there?<eos> - How do you know my real name?<eos> - I know a lot of things about you.
You said he'd be in his office.<eos> I said he'd probably be in his office.<eos> - Well, where is he actually, then?<eos> - I can't be sure.<eos> Do not tell me that you don't know what's been going on at this hotel.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> Where would he take her?<eos> Sometimes he... disappears into the basement.<eos> No, no. You're no psychic.<eos> If I'm not who I say I am, then how would I know that your father beat you when you were a child?
Sometimes he... disappears into the basement.<eos> No, no. You're no psychic.<eos> If I'm not who I say I am, then how would I know that your father beat you when you were a child?<eos> And your mother... your mother was too weak to stop him, wasn't she?<eos> - You're just trying to trick me.<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> I know that you have a baby with your first wife and that you abandoned your family... to start a new one with a new woman.<eos> There have been so many women that you have loved and killed.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> I can help you.
Hey! I know you can hear me.<eos> You bitch!<eos> Come in here!<eos> Rage, Sarah.<eos> Rage!<eos> Let it all out.<eos> Where's Kira? I'll kill you for this!<eos> Siobhan already tried.<eos> Don't worry. I was restrained from above.<eos> Rachel's donned the velvet glove for you and yours.
You're joking. Where did you find her?<eos> She contacted one of our Sarah Manning avatars. We verified it.<eos> It's her.<eos> Where is she really, though?<eos> Like, geographically.<eos> Her last message was, like, 20 minutes ago.<eos> That's my loft.<eos> Mrs Hendrix, I'm Dr Slaight.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I spoke with your surgeon, he said he'd discuss a C-section with you.
Led Zeppelin?<eos> I'm not sure, but he is English.<eos> You take and you take and you take and as soon as you bend over, you shove it right up your ass!<eos> - Oh, you.<eos> You slippery, two-faced cunt.<eos> You're upset.<eos> How dare you talk business with my client behind my back?<eos> Listen to me, I was trying to get your attention, okay?<eos> Were you even going to tell me?<eos> Tell you what?

I'm archiving a little something for the family so that your kids' kids and my kids' kids can see this.<eos> You want to say a little something?<eos> Just say one thing, Richie, come on.<eos> - One thing?<eos> - Yeah, one thing, come on.<eos> You bought me this camera.<eos> Say a little something on the camera, you know?<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Hi, Dom.<eos> If you don't get that camera out of my face, I'm gonna throw you in the fucking pool.
One more month.<eos> Please, Bellamy.<eos> I found a hot band.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means that I can convince the company to sign them and then they'll make me an AR rep and then I can get a place of my own.<eos> We'll dump him, they'll find him, the cops will think it's just another drug deal that went bad.<eos> And then what?<eos> Then what? Richie, you get on with your fucking life.<eos> Won't the cops come around?<eos> Richie, I told you, you don't know nothing.
Hey, that's Donny Osmond, right?<eos> You hear that, you prick?<eos> They're raw, like I said, but they're edgier than Neon Boys and they're angrier than the Dolls.<eos> I went and saw them and they kill it live.<eos> They just went mad, this nuts, electric energy.<eos> It was amazing.<eos> What?<eos> The band, Nasty Bits.<eos> Yeah, right. Good.<eos> Zak needs to see you right away.
You know I'm good for it.<eos> You know my money's good as gold.<eos> Oh, come on, Maury.<eos> I don't know what it is with you people.<eos> You got a reputation for knowing what to do with money except for when you're supposed to have it.<eos> As of last week, your own accountant valued my company at a million three.<eos> 150 grand of which you still owe me.<eos> We have a top-shelf talent roster.<eos> The Drifters, the Monotones, half a dozen number one hits.<eos> I'll tell you what. I'm gonna make a deal with you.
I fucked up really bad.<eos> And I want to tell you.<eos> You can tell me.<eos> - I can't. - Yeah, you can.<eos> - I can't. - Yeah, you can.<eos> Come on, you can tell me.<eos> I know.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I know.<eos> Our life isn't enough for you.
Come on, you can tell me.<eos> I know.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I know.<eos> Our life isn't enough for you.<eos> - No, it's not enough.<eos> You need this. - No.<eos> - Yeah, here you go.<eos> - No. No.<eos> Our life isn't enough for you.
Last time I was there, he called me Fatty Boom Boom.<eos> First, there's this dry food.<eos> Now you're telling me you got a girlfriend.<eos> Next you're gonna be leaving the family business.<eos> You must not like me very much.<eos> Is that what this is all about?<eos> I'm sorry, Dad.<eos> I can add more oil if you want.<eos> I'm not hungry anymore.<eos> Dad, I don't wanna leave you.
Next you're gonna be leaving the family business.<eos> You must not like me very much.<eos> Is that what this is all about?<eos> I'm sorry, Dad.<eos> I can add more oil if you want.<eos> I'm not hungry anymore.<eos> Dad, I don't wanna leave you.<eos> But I guess I do like Janet.<eos> She might not like me, though, not when she gets to know me.<eos> If she gets to know you.
You'll leave and I'll die of loneliness.<eos> People do that, you know.<eos> They get so lonely, their heart stops and they die.<eos> But you won't care.<eos> You'll be too busy making love.<eos> Cut it out, Dad.<eos> Quit goofing off.<eos> I'm not going anywhere, Dad.<eos> You know how I am with the ladies.<eos> But seriously, I have something I need to tell you.
I'm not the Greasy Strangler.<eos> I never said you were, Ronnie.<eos> I'm not the Greasy Strangler.<eos> All right, Big Brayden.<eos> - Hey, Oinker.<eos> - You ready to hit the Horror House?<eos> Hey, you didn't tell me you were out tonight.<eos> Two nights in a row is not permitted, unless I come with you.<eos> Or I could evict you.<eos> Dad, I told you this morning.
Yeah, usually.<eos> But I got teeth to brush.<eos> Go ahead, keep peeing.<eos> I won't look.<eos> I thought you weren't gonna look.<eos> Hey, beautiful Janet.<eos> Oh, hey, Brayden.<eos> Are we exclusive?<eos> Because my dad said he watched you go pee.<eos> Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
You mean, meeting Ricky Prickles with his ripped-up abdominal muscles had nothing to do with her leaving?<eos> That's it for you, Colonel Crapper.<eos> - Sergeant Shizzly, you're evicted.<eos> - Dad!<eos> You've only got three and a half hours to vacate the property.<eos> No!<eos> OK, you're not really evicted, but you will be, if you don't let me spend some time getting to know Janet.<eos> But she seems nice.<eos> She seems like a nice, true girl.<eos> I don't want this cunt to fuck you up and leave you lonely.
I think you know exactly where I got this delicious oil.<eos> - 'Hello?<eos> - Janet, it's me.<eos> - 'What's going on?<eos> ' - Oh, nothing much, just losing my mind.<eos> I think my dad might be the Greasy Strangler.<eos> - 'Do you want me to come over?<eos> ' - No, don't come over.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> I couldn't bear to lose you.
- 'Hello?<eos> - Janet, it's me.<eos> - 'What's going on?<eos> ' - Oh, nothing much, just losing my mind.<eos> I think my dad might be the Greasy Strangler.<eos> - 'Do you want me to come over?<eos> ' - No, don't come over.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> I couldn't bear to lose you.<eos> I yearn for you but I have to protect you now.
Can I come?<eos> I could use a boogie-woogie.<eos> I've got the blues.<eos> I don't know.<eos> What do you think, Paul?<eos> Shall we bring my son along?<eos> No way!<eos> Absolutely not, Ronnie.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Yeah, I told you he was a manic depressive.
I love you.<eos> Holy shit. Will you marry me?<eos> Yes, I will, mister.<eos> Dad!<eos> - Were you here the whole time?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Don't hide under Brayden's bed.<eos> Hey, you're my girlfriend.<eos> And by the way, he wouldn't even exist if he hadn't flown out of my long, juicy prickus.<eos> And as for you, as your father I forbid you to marry.
And as for you, as your father I forbid you to marry.<eos> And one other thing, you're evicted, so it's time for you to fuck off.<eos> We're leaving right now and we're leaving gladly.<eos> Brayden will move into my place.<eos> He'll be happier there.<eos> He can twaddle my twat any time that he wants.<eos> And, I don't care if he craps on the bed.<eos> I'll rub it on my tits.<eos> Yeah, Dad, we don't need you.<eos> And it kills you to think that Janet loves me.
You're not the only Greasy Strangler.<eos> I'm the Greasy Strangler too.<eos> You're all right, Brayden.<eos> Thanks, Dad.<eos> That means a lot, coming from you.<eos> We never really got along, though, did we?<eos> Yeah.<eos> By which I mean, nah.<eos> It wasn't always like that.<eos> You were a cute baby. I used to love cradling you.
OK.<eos> John Travolta talking about Brayden.<eos> I'm kind of trying to process that.<eos> Me and John were busting our butts on a big business deal.<eos> That's kind of amazing, Dad.<eos> Yeah, he offered me a chance to move to New Orleans to open a big disco with very expensive drinks, a billiards room, a cherry-coloured, funky dance floor.<eos> There was going to be a pink limo to cruise the Big Easy and pick up those hot dancing mamasitas.<eos> It was gonna be called "John and Ron's Dance Jungle".<eos> But you were small.<eos> I really didn't wanna leave you with Mum and Ricky Prickles.
Okay. Super helpful, uh...<eos> Oh, so marketing wants sign-off on the new billboard.<eos> What do you think? It might be a little heavy on the Photoshop.<eos> Get me a real F-16. We'll take some real pictures.<eos> No, they said they don't have the budget for it.<eos> Fire the marketing department!<eos> You wanna fire the entire marketing department?<eos> No. I wanna fly a real F-16.<eos> What's next?<eos> I'm supposed to remind you, Lara's left two messages.
Okay. Well, then instead, let's play a little game.<eos> You know, just for the fun of it. Raise your hand if your name is on the company letterhead.<eos> - Tom...<eos> - No, no. Come on, we'll just call it a vote.<eos> - Tom...<eos> - Fifty-one percent!<eos> Feels good to win.<eos> You can sell shares at my funeral.<eos> And the next time Ian wants to play CEO, we can fire him together.<eos> - Hey, can I borrow you for a minute?
This is pretty.<eos> It's gorgeous, right?<eos> He's an Abercrombie model?<eos> Wait till you see this view.<eos> - Hi, Josh.<eos> - Hi. We need to talk.<eos> Let's talk inside.<eos> No, let's just do it out here.<eos> Where, in the grass?<eos> I know that we've been at this for months, and you must be anxious for some kind of decision. I can't keep seeing you.
We're not friends!<eos> I can't believe you just did that!<eos> Good work, but why did you grab her phone?<eos> Because I'm your daddy.<eos> Ew!<eos> Livanto, round and balanced.<eos> I can't play, Mr. Fuzzypants.<eos> That was the right answer.<eos> If this is what it takes to become human, I will be the best cat that ever lived.<eos> Hey, I brought something that's gonna wake you up.
If you've done your research, I don't know what else you want.<eos> I'm concerned that you're giving his wife false hope.<eos> I told her we don't know.<eos> Well, you know, that makes it sound like it could go either way.<eos> I can't tell her what to do.<eos> I just want you to tell her the truth.<eos> Dragging this out is so hard on this family.<eos> Just think about it.<eos> Lara, you're so beautiful.<eos> Did I tell you often enough?
You did not report this news to the governor nor to Miss Guthrie.<eos> Nor did you take any action to discover who the partners might be.<eos> Until I know how this game will unfold, I choose to allow the players to reveal themselves to me lest I make an enemy out of someone I may one day wish to call a friend.<eos> This way.<eos> Is it possible one of the governor's calls for assistance was heard?<eos> Reinforcements from a sister colony?<eos> Flint gave you command of his ship.<eos> Yes.<eos> You can count the things that Flint and I agree upon on one hand.<eos> But among them is the sincere confusion as to why Charles invested any time and energy in you.
Jamie?<eos> Jamie?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Everything okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Sure.<eos> So I had this new idea for... for my photography that I was gonna take a picture of everything that I owned so it would be a self-portrait of myself through the stuff that I have.<eos> Can I show you?
She likes to say she's self-destructive.<eos> Her mother is a therapist.<eos> We used to talk and I... had a better sense of what was going on with you.<eos> She makes Julie attend her teen group sessions.<eos> How about the possibility... that you're choosing boys who are inappropriate... unconsciously?<eos> When her mother remarried, Julie changed.<eos> I love this shirt!<eos> Don't get me wrong...<eos> When her half-sister Amanda was born with cerebral palsy, she changed more.<eos> Wow, it looks really pretty on you.
And in the future?<eos> There was damage to the muscle wall, from the surgery.<eos> You have an incompetent cervix.<eos> Incompetent?<eos> It may not be strong enough to go full term during pregnancy.<eos> As the baby grows, the cervix widens.<eos> If it's weakened, it's likely to open prematurely.<eos> I'm gonna be okay.<eos> He said that I probably can't have kids.<eos> Was having Jamie, like... the biggest thing that ever happened to you?
You know all the stocks?<eos> Yeah.<eos> IBM is down, huh?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'll fix it next time.<eos> That...<eos> Good job on that.<eos> - William?<eos> - Yes?<eos> Do I seem stuck to you?
- Okay.<eos> Put your hand out, right?<eos> Put the other hand here.<eos> And just be there.<eos> She just wants a little company.<eos> Oh.<eos> Okay.<eos> That's nice.<eos> I... I feel like I...<eos> I understand you.
Oh.<eos> Okay.<eos> That's nice.<eos> I... I feel like I...<eos> I understand you.<eos> We should get away from here.<eos> Just... just me and you, you know?<eos> Go up the coast, be alone somewhere.<eos> Jamie, you're in love with Julie.<eos> You can't let her push you around.
I'm a dog laying on the floor showing you my belly.<eos> Jackie Jervis sent me a case of Dom.<eos> Jackie Jervis is a twat.<eos> He suck you off, too?<eos> He didn't have to. All the Dom I drank, I got too tired.<eos> You know how many funk acts they have over there at Koronet Records?<eos> - Not gonna remember your name.<eos> - He said my name a lot.<eos> - He got it down.<eos> Can I interest you in this?
He didn't have to. All the Dom I drank, I got too tired.<eos> You know how many funk acts they have over there at Koronet Records?<eos> - Not gonna remember your name.<eos> - He said my name a lot.<eos> - He got it down.<eos> Can I interest you in this?<eos> Or do you want to run home to Jackie's Dom?<eos> - Give me that.<eos> - Line it up.<eos> I want to throw something on the pick for you.
How come I never walk in here and find you playing my shit?<eos> I got a Puerto Rican chick for questions like that.<eos> But she's got tits like helium balloons, so from her I'm willing to take it.<eos> I need you to hold off on the extracurricular Donny Osmond run.<eos> - The fugazis?<eos> - Yeah. I pressed them Friday. We're very efficient.<eos> Well, sit on them a couple of weeks.<eos> The trucks went out this morning. It's already at the Goody stores.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> I ask you to run something, I normally got to stand here and threaten to piss in your face before it gets done.
You made this bed, not me.<eos> You're a moaning asshole.<eos> My blood pressure was 180 over 90!<eos> Man, fuck the coat. I'm gonna get you an actual leopard.<eos> Like a baby one?<eos> Yeah, you can't get them old or they'll eat your face off.<eos> Cece, I want to take this kid out after his show tonight, so book a table for everybody, okay?<eos> We're gonna have a goddamn vegetarian orgy.<eos> Rice. Whatever you want.<eos> Richie, there's a detective calling for you.

But it shuts him up.<eos> Hannibal!<eos> Jackie Jervis.<eos> Look at you. That's some bad pants.<eos> I want some pants like that.<eos> I'll take them off. You can wear them.<eos> Get out the way.<eos> Andrea, baby.<eos> You so hot, you dangerous.<eos> - Can I eat you alive?
I didn't read the whole script.<eos> You want me to cancel my trip?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm a jerk.<eos> - I just feel like a bad friend.<eos> - Hey, stop talking like that.<eos> You're a good friend.<eos> The two of you will go away, have a nice time.<eos> It'll be good for you. What?
- Shut up, I'm just asking.<eos> - Is she always like this?<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Your friend, is she always so, um.<eos> - So what?<eos> - So curious?<eos> I don't think that's what you were gonna say.<eos> - No, no, it's just you're very inquisitive.<eos> - I mean, I think this is interesting.<eos> You are in a group with a bunch of guys that if they get jealous of you, you wrestle them. Like, what?
- Hi. - Hi, how are you?<eos> - Good, how are you?<eos> - I was wondering if I was gonna bump into you guys.<eos> - What? What are you doing here?<eos> - You didn't tell her?<eos> No, I just bumped into Beth at Capecita, and mentioned I was coming up here.<eos> No, she didn't mention that at all.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - Uh, well, I'm hiking, but I'm also location scouting for this experimental short I'm doing.<eos> - Oh. - I was telling Beth that I wanted to talk to you about maybe being in it.
Just opened up. - Oh, what's it called?<eos> - It's called a tent in the woods.<eos> What about you all?<eos> - I'm staying at my aunt's house.<eos> It's, do you know the area at all?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay, it's just off the road, near Big Sur Station.<eos> - Oh, Pfeiffer Ridge?<eos> - Yeah. Well, Sycamore Canyon, but yeah, yeah. You do know the area.<eos> - Can I talk to you for a second?
Hey, it's okay.<eos> Nice place.<eos> - Hello, hello.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hello. Paul?<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Paul.<eos> Hold on. I'm gonna call you back from the land line, okay?
- Why does she think you fucked her over?<eos> - Because I didn't tell her about Matt's thing.<eos> - What thing?<eos> - The thing. The short.<eos> Matt's thing, Matt's short film.<eos> - What?<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> It's mainly the thing with Adele.<eos> - What thing with Adele?<eos> - Oh my god, do you even listen to me when I talk to you?
Don't you remember me telling you that?<eos> - Right, yeah.<eos> You thought it was too soon.<eos> - Exactly, and I was going to send it, but I had only been with Adele for like three months, and she wanted me to send Adele the link to her awful fucking website, and I was going to do it,<eos> but then she got so crazy and intense about it, so then, I just told her that I had sent it.<eos> - I really don't understand why you do stuff like that.<eos> - I was going to send it.<eos> - Yeah, well, why lie?<eos> - Could you not give me the third degree right now?<eos> I am telling you, she's acting completely fucking crazy.
- Right, yeah.<eos> You thought it was too soon.<eos> - Exactly, and I was going to send it, but I had only been with Adele for like three months, and she wanted me to send Adele the link to her awful fucking website, and I was going to do it,<eos> but then she got so crazy and intense about it, so then, I just told her that I had sent it.<eos> - I really don't understand why you do stuff like that.<eos> - I was going to send it.<eos> - Yeah, well, why lie?<eos> - Could you not give me the third degree right now?<eos> I am telling you, she's acting completely fucking crazy.<eos> - You sure you don't want me to come up there and get you?
Really, that's my favorite kind of movie.<eos> What is this one?<eos> - It's, it's, this one is especially stupid.<eos> It's, embarrassing.<eos> - Try me. What's it about?<eos> - It's about stones.<eos> - What about 'em?<eos> - It's about stones. It's, I don't know, set in Iceland, where, I guess, they have this weird mythology where stones turn into trolls, or something, only that's a red herring, because, really,<eos> it's this serial killer, but, for a while, you think it is trolls, and, I don't know.<eos> It's, I told you, it's so embarrassing.
- Holy crap.<eos> Holy crap, it's Frankenstein!<eos> - Save me!<eos> Oh my god!<eos> Oh no, I'm gonna faint. Uh, I can't breathe.<eos> I can't, I can't.<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> He's choking me!<eos> Wait, wait, somebody, someone.<eos> And I'm back from the dead, and now, I'm gonna kill you! And then, I'm gonna make you set the table.
Come on.<eos> Kid's got to get more sleep.<eos> She's not gonna make it.<eos> Which kid, Debbie or the baby?<eos> So 2:00 still work for picking out rings?<eos> Sure, and then 4:00 at the dance place.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I thought you were joking about that.<eos> It's an hour.<eos> It won't kill you.
Mm, late tonight.<eos> His mom didn't want him to miss any school.<eos> Okay. I'll start the coffee.<eos> - Morning.<eos> - Morning.<eos> Dobroye utro.<eos> Hey, bean.<eos> Cinnamon waffles?<eos> - We have an iron? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Uh, you need me to iron a shirt for you?
Look, don't try to be all polite to me, son.<eos> I can see you've been trying to make improvements on yourself, and I can appreciate the effort, but I don't like you.<eos> I don't want to like you.<eos> Don't plan on liking you.<eos> I know what you're hanging around my little girl for.<eos> No, sir.<eos> Oh, no, I know what you're thinking every minute of every day, and not what you're thinking up there with your big head, but what's going on down there in your little head.<eos> You know those parents that want to be their child's best friend, all wanting to talk and know what's going on with them all the time?<eos> I'm not that parent.<eos> I'm the parent that has to regularly fight back the extremely powerful urge to pistol-whip you to death.
I have a right.<eos> No.<eos> Stop.<eos> I have a-a duty... to walk my daughter down the aisle and to give her away.<eos> Jesus, are you high?<eos> Yes, I am, actually, but that's beside the point.<eos> Come on. Come on, Frank. Let's go.<eos> Nobody wants you here, Frank, just go.<eos> I'm your father.<eos> I may not have always been a great one, but I'm still your father and I'm gonna walk you down that fucking aisle.
And Fiona, my beautiful Fiona.<eos> You've let so many men drive up the freeway between your legs you're going to have to put an exit sign on your vagina.<eos> And now you're marrying Sean.<eos> Oh, yeah, I know you, Seanny boy.<eos> Takes a dope fiend to know a dope fiend, and you are world-class.<eos> I went by your business last night late when nobody was there, and I found some things.<eos> Maybe we should go back there, you and your bride-to-be, and show her the little box you hide under the invoices, the bottom drawer of the filing cabinet.<eos> The b... you know, with the needles and the spoon, the rubber tubing and the little, uh... baggies with this brown powder?<eos> How many hits did it take you this morning?<eos> How many did you think it was gonna take you to get through all this wedding shit?
Magnificent!<eos> I like very much. But we can not feed a beast so at the time.<eos> in the<eos> Go easy, tell him I sent you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Georges!<eos> I look at you.
But he does not tell me anything.<eos> - The circus companions laugh.<eos> - Yes, it's funny, but this is not enough.<eos> Consider writing situations.<eos> So I, as a viewer, I'm not involved.<eos> And I'm bored.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Here it is.<eos> This makes me laugh.<eos> I speak to you as a professional, Kananga.
E no!<eos> She Eun fool, Mr. Chocolat.<eos> I've had enough.<eos> A monkey would understand more quickly than him!<eos> And now a nice bow!<eos> I spank your bottom.<eos> Lower.<eos> I do not finish?<eos> You want me to tell you I?<eos> It has a great fear of losing you, Footit.
Then some guy found me on the street, got into a fight.<eos> ME a<eos> And when I discovered the circus, it was all beautiful.<eos> Also making the cannibal.<eos> Era facile...<eos> Madeleine came yesterday evening.<eos> Tuberculosis.<eos> We'll have to put it into isolation.<eos> Ciao, Madeleine.<eos> I introduce you to one person.
His natural son, of course.<eos> Did he have any other kind?<eos> Indeed.<eos> But this one was something of a favourite, God knows why.<eos> He's staying with me, now he's back in St. Petersburg.<eos> Well, please don't bring him again.<eos> He looks like a wild animal, so unlike your own lovely children.<eos> Such beautiful creatures!<eos> Look at Papa, scheming away.<eos> I think he's negotiating to get you into a nunnery.
You see good in revolution, sir?<eos> The equality of all citizens, freedom of speech, liberty, equality, fraternity, these are ideas we could learn from in Russia.<eos> Our drawing rooms are full of overfed aristocrats who have no idea what real life is, who have even forgotten how to speak their own language!<eos> By God, we could do with a revolution here!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I shouldn't have...<eos> It was just...<eos> - Pierre, old friend.<eos> - Andrei!<eos> It's so good to see you here.
Can you imagine?<eos> I still don't know.<eos> But I do think I could make something of my life, do something extraordinary, even.<eos> Lead the revolution, perhaps?<eos> I know, I deserve to be mocked.<eos> - If you could see how I waste my nights...<eos> - Ah, yes, well...<eos> If you're asking for my advice,<eos> I'd chuck Anatole Kuragin and that gang.<eos> That sort of debauchery doesn't suit you.
Dear Pierre, I'm so glad you came!<eos> Monsieur Bezukhov.<eos> What is it?<eos> My father, he's had another stroke.<eos> We'll go together.<eos> Quickly, now!<eos> It's a matter of life or death!<eos> You must be a man now.<eos> You have to look after your own interests, don't expect your cousin Vassily to.<eos> You need to let the old Count see you before he dies.
I know you think I am stupid, but I know this, an illegitimate son cannot inherit.<eos> Un batard!<eos> But didn't the Count write to the Emperor to say he recognised Pierre as his son?<eos> Yes, yes, but it was never sent.<eos> And what does it matter, anyway?<eos> Don't you see?<eos> If it's discovered in his papers,<eos> Pierre will be Count Bezukhov and inherit everything!<eos> But what about our share?<eos> My God, don't you understand what I'm saying to you? !
- You have no business here, I think.<eos> - I have a perfect right to be here.<eos> You know very well the Count is my near relation and poor Boris, his dear godson, who has more claim than us to be here at this sad time.<eos> Yes, yes, very well, but you must expect nothing.<eos> - How is my father?<eos> - Very ill.<eos> After this last stroke, he's not expected to last the night.<eos> Truly?<eos> Can I see him?<eos> Would he wish to see you?
I was out riding at dawn.<eos> Get out, you smell all horsey.<eos> Mmm, what lovely smooth skin.<eos> - Stop that, Anatole.<eos> - You know you love it.<eos> Listen, has Papa spoken to you?<eos> - What about?<eos> - He wants to marry us both off.<eos> Me to Andrei Bolkonsky's churchy little country-mouse sister...<eos> - Oh, she'd suit you perfectly.
Who?<eos> - Guess.<eos> - I can't.<eos> What do you say to...<eos> Pierre Bezukhov?<eos> You're joking.<eos> I am... not.<eos> Oh, he's such a buffoon, Anatole.<eos> Stop doing that!<eos> He's a very wealthy buffoon and he worships you.
All right, boy, all right.<eos> You'll soon be up again.<eos> Little Rook, what have they done to you?<eos> Over here!<eos> Don't kill me!<eos> Don't kill me!<eos> Please, please!<eos> S'il vous plait, ne me tuez pas!<eos> All right, my little bunny rabbit.<eos> No-one's going to hurt you here.
How do you feel?<eos> Dude, I feel fucking awesome.<eos> I have, like, undergone a change, and I want her to know that it's real.<eos> But she's like, resistant, a little bit. So, I just, like...<eos> I got something planned this weekend that's gonna, like, take it up a notch, so...<eos> Go something up your sleeve?<eos> I got a little something tucked up in the sleeve. I'm gonna whoop... pull it out.<eos> I love that!<eos> That's great.<eos> It's good to see you.
I mean...<eos> I wanted to do something...<eos> Things have been really weird between us.<eos> I wanted to...<eos> I missed you, and it was a long time, and I realized that you're my best friend.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm not doing anything.<eos> Come on.<eos> Well, it's not...<eos> It's not that easy for me to be around you.
Come on.<eos> Well, it's not...<eos> It's not that easy for me to be around you.<eos> Why?<eos> Are you gonna make me say this?<eos> You have a girl.<eos> I mean, can't we just...<eos> Can't we just get back to normal?<eos> You... You...<eos> But I should be thanking you because it's the best thing that's ever happened to me.
I just wanna raise show dogs.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Susan, we are fighting the clock big time.<eos> Fine. Fine.<eos> Okay? Gus can stay on.<eos> Okay?<eos> Are you happy?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Fuckin' Gus, man.<eos> Way to get a child to fight your battles for you.
Andrew isn't coming with us?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> You and I are going to be very busy.<eos> Why, Richard Roper, I do declare...<eos> Speaking of true love...<eos> What's she doing here?<eos> Thought you might want some female company.<eos> Caroline.<eos> Look who's back.<eos> Caro, lovely to see you.
You're welcome.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> It's hard keeping track of all those codes and PIN numbers, isn't it?<eos> Have you tried your birthday?<eos> I just found this...<eos> Oh, Jemima.<eos> You let someone break in here and steal from me.<eos> The question is, who?<eos> Please don't tell me it was Corky.<eos> Because I might not believe you.
You're ashamed to talk to me?<eos> Listen, I don't have time to talk to you.<eos> I'm going out.<eos> - Where you going?<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> Some... Somewhere on the island.<eos> How's the weather there? Just fine?<eos> How's Billy?<eos> As if you care.<eos> They say he doesn't even ask about you any more.
Yes, of course!<eos> The recipe lives on.<eos> We'll have that to start.<eos> All except for Major Corkoran, who will have the paella.<eos> Hi there, how are you?<eos> Very good to see you.<eos> Hi, darling, how are you?<eos> Fine.<eos> Good to see you, are you well?<eos> Good to see you again.
Fizzy drink treatment.<eos> Up the nose.<eos> Bung the mouth.<eos> And if you've got a funnel handy...<eos> Oh, it's even better.<eos> Hits you right in the switchboard.<eos> It's bloody diabolical.<eos> _<eos> Apo, how are you?<eos> - Good to see you.
_<eos> Erm, come...<eos> Rex, do you have a minute?<eos> The Permanent Secretary would love to see you.<eos> - Is that a yes or a no? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Rex, come in.<eos> - You know Geoffrey Dromgoole, of course, - Geoffrey. - and his team from the River.<eos> - Rex. Barbara Vandon from the American Embassy.<eos> Rex Mayhew, my undersecretary.<eos> - Good to see you, Rex.
How was your meeting?<eos> It was fine.<eos> It was fine?<eos> Don't be so bloody childish!<eos> Look, Caro was upset.<eos> She wanted to get back at Sandy so she started spreading manure.<eos> That's it. End of story.<eos> That's what it is... it's just a story?<eos> Jesus, Jed, what the hell is the matter with you?<eos> Tell me why I should believe you.
I think you would prefer it, too.<eos> Now look here.<eos> I've got code names and I've got numbers and I've got pages to cross-reference, but what I don't have is someone to join the dots for me and tell me what the bloody hell is going on.<eos> Will you leave me alone?<eos> You have my word.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> - What is wrong with you?<eos> - What the hell do you think you're doing?<eos> No-one saw me.<eos> You saw no-one see you.
Corky's my friend.<eos> Corky is a trained killer.<eos> Now, I need money.<eos> As much as you have.<eos> Notes.<eos> Doesn't matter which currency, dollars are best.<eos> - That's all I have.<eos> - That's good.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - I'm going to get you out of here.
You give her this note.<eos> $200.<eos> There'll be 200 waiting for you when you get there.<eos> No problem.<eos> Not my boy! Not my boy!<eos> Been bunking off again, old chap?<eos> You can go to detention for that, you know.<eos> It's your word against mine.<eos> That's a risk I have to take.<eos> I'm gonna kill you now, understand?
No, I...<eos> - I can't sing.<eos> - Me neither.<eos> So?<eos> Pass me the song list.<eos> This one.<eos> This one's perfect.<eos> I'm off.<eos> I've had way too much to drink.<eos> It was great to meet you, Wim.
Her name is Marie.<eos> I found her wallet outside last night.<eos> She looks familiar. Don't you think?<eos> She looks like the girl in that commercial...<eos> The commercial where they have... but short and...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Doesn't ring a bell.<eos> I found her number in the white pages.<eos> You call a pretty girl like that.<eos> Leave you to it.
I saw it lying there on the beach, next to Nowell. I had left that bodily form.<eos> I looked at myself like a stranger.<eos> That's when I turned towards the sea and saw you.<eos> How did you see me?<eos> I saw the sea maiden in a dreamlike light.<eos> When I started to make the video, I searched actresses' faces for one that looked like her.<eos> And when I discovered your perfume ad, I couldn't believe my eyes.<eos> - You know, the one that...<eos> - Yeah, yeah, I know the one.<eos> Even now, I feel troubled when I look at you.
So I did what the sea maiden asked.<eos> I raised my arms and it was like being reborn.<eos> Like becoming someone else.<eos> That was the reality.<eos> I became someone else.<eos> From now on, your name is Cosmo.<eos> "Cosmo"?<eos> Yes, Cosmo.<eos> Like the cosmos, without the second 's'.<eos> Next, you'll stop making such cynical music, which doesn't suit you at all.
Hang on.<eos> The big wrap party's tonight.<eos> Did you distribute the flyers?<eos> I did it during the break.<eos> Coming?<eos> I'm counting on you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> See you later.<eos> It's me.<eos> I've got something weird to tell you.
- Oh please...<eos> I fell for you the moment I saw you at the bus stop.<eos> Have you slept together?<eos> Maybe... you two should talk one-to-one.<eos> Let's go have a smoke, Oscar.<eos> But I quit smoking, Simeon.<eos> Come.<eos> Oscar.<eos> my electro-hypersensitivity and my book launch.<eos> There's something I wanted to say to you.
Keep digging into him.<eos> Yeah, you got it.<eos> Jay, work up a timeline of Condon's movements leading up to the shooting.<eos> We need to know if he was a lone wolf or if others were involved.<eos> Hey, Delina, I need to see the body.<eos> Hey.<eos> Thought you were ordered to take the day off to meet with psych services.<eos> Yeah, well, you know how I feel about psych services.<eos> Take a look.<eos> Something bothering you?
What do you got?<eos> So the tox results came in for Eli Condon.<eos> Curious thing... he wasn't drunk or high in the usual sense of the word, but there were traces of dextro-lysergamide in his system.<eos> Which is a good thing or a bad thing?<eos> Dextro-lysergamide is part of a group of powerful antipsychotic drugs called psychotropics.<eos> But we didn't find any history of mental illness, and Eli wasn't taking any prescribed medications.<eos> Right, but see, the thing about psychotropics is they've been linked to mind manipulation and mental control, so it's possible that...<eos> Mind control?<eos> I know it sounds crazy.<eos> I'm just telling you what I found.
Come on, Al.<eos> That's a little farfetched, no?<eos> No more so than the rest of this.<eos> We need to cancel the senator's appearance before somebody else gets a phone call that turns them into a killer.<eos> You gonna take on a senator, boss?<eos> You got that kind of pull?<eos> I got friends in low places.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> I was, uh, surprised to get your call.<eos> It's good to see you.
I do.<eos> I need you all the time.<eos> The day you walked back into my life...<eos> Technically, you walked back into mine, my little apartment in Queens.<eos> 5:00 a.m, you were pounding on the door...<eos> - Boom, boom, boom.<eos> - It was a gentle knock.<eos> And I said, "Hey, you don't have to break it down.<eos> I hear you."<eos> Nice to see you too.
Hey. What happened?<eos> The Army's relocating these people!<eos> They got word they're harboring terrorists!<eos> The terrorists here are the ones they're creating.<eos> Kelly!<eos> Damien?<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Same as you.<eos> I meant to call.<eos> Hey, uh, Kelly, it's good to see you.
She grabbed your face and said, "Damien, I love you."<eos> - Can you find her?<eos> - Why should I help you?<eos> - We had something. We did.<eos> But...<eos> - And you just disappeared?<eos> No explanation?<eos> It was the only way.<eos> You have to trust me.<eos> I did trust you.
You have to trust me.<eos> I did trust you.<eos> Can you find that woman?<eos> I'll try.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, Tiffany.<eos> I'll take it from here.<eos> - Damien Thorn.<eos> Long time.<eos> - Good to see you, Cray. I, uh...
And, uh...<eos> Someone shouted out my name, that they loved me.<eos> My governess was standing on the ledge in front of everyone with a rope around her neck.<eos> Uh... She looked straight at me, and she said...<eos> "It's all for you."<eos> And then she jumped to her death.<eos> Jesus.<eos> How could that old woman know those exact words?<eos> This is why I left, Kelly.<eos> I couldn't drag you into this.
What's the big deal?<eos> I hope I'm not disturbing anything.<eos> Uh, actually, we've...<eos> Uh, we were just finished up. Um...<eos> See if you can find that and call me later?<eos> Sure thing.<eos> Listen, uh, I would love to, uh, hang.<eos> You see how the bossman is, wants what he wants.<eos> I know.<eos> Was, um, was good to see you.
See if you can find that and call me later?<eos> Sure thing.<eos> Listen, uh, I would love to, uh, hang.<eos> You see how the bossman is, wants what he wants.<eos> I know.<eos> Was, um, was good to see you.<eos> You, too.<eos> These pictures... why do you have them hanging in your home?<eos> The pain.<eos> That dark cloud that's been following you.
I know a suicide when I see one, Mr. Thorn.<eos> We're keeping you for 72-hour observation.<eos> And I believe the police want to speak to you.<eos> There's a Detective Shay on his way.<eos> Yo! Where you been?<eos> Been trying to reach you all night.<eos> I've been busy.<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> Come inside.<eos> There's this guy, he keeps asking to talk to you.
Like, faces showing up in... in photographs, people knowing my name, saying things to me.<eos> The... the stuff I saw in the basement of that V.A. hospital was like something from a nightmare.<eos> That's what psychological warfare is, Damien.<eos> She made you imagine things, or misinterpret things.<eos> No, this was not my imagination.<eos> It was too real.<eos> It was like...<eos> The past is like a noose around our necks.<eos> I imagine you don't remember much.<eos> I'd never do anything to hurt you.
All that blood test proves is that there are drugs in your system.<eos> It doesn't prove who put them there.<eos> You and I know exactly who put them there.<eos> We also know who's behind all of this.<eos> We just need to start building our case.<eos> I have to be completely honest with you.<eos> It wasn't just Ann Rutledge.<eos> I played a role, too.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> After your parents died, your legal guardians just packed you off from one boarding school to another.
I feel like my life's been given back to me.<eos> Well, maybe it was part of the larger process.<eos> You're maturing.<eos> Finally accepting who you really are.<eos> Who is that, exactly?<eos> I'd like to hear it from you.<eos> Is this a game?<eos> You tell me.<eos> You're the second of only two prophets whose coming is foretold in the Bible.<eos> In Isaiah 14:12, God calls you "Son of the Morning."
I was still bedridden in the clinic in Fribourg when they told me that you and your father were dead.<eos> They said that he had gone crazy and... stabbed you, and that then the police had arrived and shot him.<eos> It was like a nightmare.<eos> It wasn't until months later, when I saw your graves, that I realized it was all really true.<eos> Or so I thought.<eos> And I was so ashamed.<eos> Of what?<eos> They put ideas in my head,<eos> Mrs. Baylock and the others...<eos> The way they looked at you, and the things they said...

I have no one.<eos> Whenever I got close to anybody...<eos> These are very sick, dangerous people.<eos> Why?<eos> Because there is nothing more truly terrifying than somebody who really believes that their actions are divinely justified. By heaven or by hell.<eos> It's over now.<eos> They don't know you're here.<eos> They don't know we know.<eos> I can't give you back the years that they took from us.<eos> But I promise you, I won't let them hurt you ever again.
I happen to agree with her.<eos> I didn't kill anybody.<eos> Then why is there blood on your shirt?<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> Please!<eos> Ann Rutledge is behind all of this!<eos> She knew!<eos> She knew he could confirm my story, that's why she had him killed!<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, I'll tell you what.
Scary thing about this hallway... there are no cameras.<eos> Uhh! Oh, yeah. Come on, try something.<eos> Give me the chance.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> That professor, your dog attack, the taxi... nothing to do with me.<eos> Let me tell you how this plays out with guys like you, how we handle it.<eos> Now, I know you're a piece of shit, but I can't prove it.<eos> So I keep my eyes on you.<eos> Person of interest.<eos> And I keep you here all night for questioning, kick you free when you're exhausted, and then bring you back tomorrow... and the next night, and all next week.
Bye.<eos> We can't hold you.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> What is this?<eos> Did you see the room?<eos> I'll take it from here.<eos> Everything's going to be all right.<eos> What the hell did she tell you?<eos> You can't let her do this. You take care.<eos> And don't let me see you again.
He hates everybody.<eos> That's why he's a cop.<eos> Well, he's right.<eos> You should leave well enough alone. I got it.<eos> If that suspect has a history of mental illness... That only confuses his alibi.<eos> That doesn't explain anything about all the deaths around him.<eos> It's a statistical cluster...<eos> Don't talk down to me, okay?<eos> You know I can't handle the Stephen Hawking shit.<eos> Well, I try not to talk down to you.
- ...was given unto him them which dwell therein to worship the first and his authority... - And he doeth great wonders over all kindreds or the number of his name.<eos> Here is wisdom.<eos> Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is Six Hundred Threescore and Six.<eos> Son of Night, you are given authority over the Earth.<eos> - You will kill by the sword...<eos> - By famine...<eos> - By plague...<eos> - And through wild beasts.<eos> - You will lead astray - all nations of the Earth.<eos> Your name is Death, and Hell follows behind you.
Shut it down!<eos> Bro, this is f****king killer stuff!<eos> I am telling you, we are going to kill it, the market is...<eos> Coke-c*k, coke-c*e. .. It's going to be an anthem, man.<eos> I can see it.<eos> I can so f****king see it, man.<eos> Yo, bro! Coke-c*k is the stuff.<eos> Coke- c*k is the scene<eos> This is the international stuff.<eos> I tell you, this is going to be the net swag!
Yes, sir.<eos> - F**k off!<eos> Make it quick... move!<eos> See... cop power?<eos> Yes.<eos> Who is calling?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'll be there... right away.<eos> Let's go, Sana].<eos> I'll show you what 'law and order' can do.
Get ready.<eos> Aren't you late for college?<eos> And remove this idiofs poster.<eos> With your precious vote, make Rajveer Singh Pehlwan win.<eos> His victory is yours as well.<eos> Please vote for him!<eos> Vote for Rajveer Singh!<eos> Come here...<eos> Need money?<eos> If I find you at a coffee shop, I'll thrash you.
What else should I do?<eos> Who wants to hear the f**king right thing?<eos> They only want rubbish which I've said for four years.<eos> Made me a pop star!<eos> The F**k!<eos> A pop star at f**king 22!<eos> Asian underground number three.<eos> Tommy, the GABRU!<eos> And now... poof!<eos> Think... if someone tells you that your best times are over.
Chetan, hold him.<eos> Balli, listen...<eos> Thorazine, quick!<eos> Stop.<eos> Drop me here.<eos> On Radio Bollyvvood, I am your RJ Ivlanveer.<eos> It's 9 AIVI. Tommy Singh's been absconding for the past 12 hours.<eos> What's going on, brother?<eos> Tommy, you have any idea...<eos> I have lots to tell you.
Sit down.<eos> First let's check into a hotel.<eos> I have to freshen up.<eos> I haven't eaten since last night.<eos> And there's this girl that I have to save.<eos> For once think of someone other than yourself, a**h**e!<eos> Do you know where my dad is, Tommy?<eos> They've put him in jail.<eos> The police must be beating him asking him where Tommy is.<eos> If it were up to me, Tommy... I'd hand you over to the police myself.
Come on.<eos> What?<eos> (LAUGHS) You're not a good father.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> I'm a good parent.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, tell yourself that, because before you know it,<eos> Stella is gonna be a tween who hates you, and it's gonna be your fault because you let her play with Kelly's dildo.
Yay!<eos> We have all brand new feather duvets.<eos> That's dope.<eos> And we got a new chef, and we're going gluten-free.<eos> (CHEERING CONTINUES)<eos> Hi.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> (COUGHS)<eos> (INDISTINCT WHISPERS)<eos> I totally should've offered it to you first, man.
Congrats.<eos> Lots of Outbacks.<eos> But, dude, tell me what's going on with your app.<eos> Changing the world and shit.<eos> You know, one dick at a time.<eos> (ALL LAUGHING)<eos> Seriously, that's a great idea, man.<eos> Thank you!<eos> An app that makes pics of your dick bigger.<eos> I meant to tell you, I enjoyed your TED Talk.
It's actually not weird.<eos> It's actually super normal.<eos> Whatever makes you happy, right? (CHUCKLES)<eos> Darren, can you back the fuck off?<eos> Whoa, whoa, Teddy!<eos> Relax!<eos> I finally found somewhere that I'm good at, where I'm valued!<eos> You want to criticize that?<eos> What I was saying is that it's just a little weird for a grown man to be helping a bunch of girls make a sorority.<eos> Doesn't that sound crazy to you?
(SIZZLING)<eos> Oh, that's really hot!<eos> Ow!<eos> It burns!<eos> Rub that shit in.<eos> All right, rub it in.<eos> Rub it in.<eos> Jeez. (PANTS)<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> God bless you, kid.
Fuck it!<eos> (GROANING)<eos> It broke the skin.<eos> Kelly?<eos> Why do you have Jimmy's phone? Where are you?<eos> Are you around here?<eos> Are you hiding somewhere?<eos> (CRYING) Where are you?<eos> I'm in your office!<eos> I've been looking for you.
I'm just having the worst cramps in my life every five, six minutes.<eos> Yeah, I think you're going into labor.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> The baby's not due till tomorrow.<eos> You're definitely going into labor.<eos> You need to be timing this.<eos> Oh, it's passed.<eos> I feel great.<eos> JIMMY:<eos> I told you, she's not going into labor.
Pete, wake up, man.<eos> (WHISPERING) Pete.<eos> Dude, what the fuck?<eos> (STAMMERING) What are you doing?<eos> Just calm down.<eos> Just listen.<eos> (BREATHILY) I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> When you two got engaged, I was in a bad place and I thought I was losing my best friend.<eos> Then I realized I'm never gonna lose you because we're brothers.
I'm proud of you, man.<eos> You found your niche.<eos> This just seemed like a logical conclusion.<eos> Gay wedding planning.<eos> It's a great job, and you can do it with a criminal record.<eos> My only skill is planning parties.<eos> And, for some reason, gay guys specifically, they just respond to me.<eos> It's because you're a great guy.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> And they probably wanna fuck the shit out of you.
I think we will lose this battle, and a great many men will die.<eos> My God, Bolkonsky, what a shambles!<eos> How do you really feel about Sonya?<eos> I do love her, Tasha.<eos> I haven't been a very affectionate husband... but it's no use saying that now.<eos> Here he is!<eos> Your wife is even more beautiful than I remember, Bezukhov.<eos> To the health of beautiful women, Petrushka and their lovers.<eos> I challenge you!
- What do you know about it, Denisov?<eos> Oh, I was dancing the mazurka in Poland when you were still in petticoats, my boy!<eos> Really?<eos> The way they used to teach us in Poland...<eos> Have you always lived with the family, Sonya?<eos> Yes, since I was a little girl.<eos> Nikolai speaks so warmly of you, and now I can see why.<eos> I should like to know you better, Sonya.<eos> ... It was the footman!<eos> Dolokhov watches you all the time.
- Now you're just being ridiculous.<eos> - No, I'm not!<eos> - He's the kindest, gentlest...<eos> If you could see him at home with his mother and sister...<eos> Well, I don't know about that. All I know is what I feel.<eos> And I'm sure Pierre was in the right when he challenged him.<eos> Oh, Pierre!<eos> He's an idiot.<eos> No, he's not. I'd trust him with my life.<eos> Whereas, that one can't you see he's trying to take Sonya from you?
Look.<eos> I love you, I think, more than anyone I've ever known.<eos> Well, that's enough for me.<eos> Yes, but I've fallen in love before and I expect that I will again.<eos> I can't help it, it's the way I am.<eos> And then when Mamma refuses to give her consent, you see, I'm not in a position to promise you anything.<eos> - I don't ask you to, I never have. - Yes, but I think you should consider Dolokhov's proposal.<eos> I'd rather not marry at all than marry him.<eos> I love you and I always will.<eos> But I don't ask anything of you.
Thank you for inviting me, Dolokhov.<eos> You've been a stranger lately.<eos> I've been busy.<eos> But you're still my...<eos> I mean, everything's all right between us?<eos> Why wouldn't it be?<eos> Why don't you join us at the table?<eos> Or are you afraid of playing with me?<eos> I haven't any money with me.<eos> That's all right, I trust you.
That's how it goes sometimes.<eos> Perhaps you'd like to quit, Rostov?<eos> 40 on the King.<eos> Place your bets.<eos> - 1,000 on the ace.<eos> - Any more?<eos> Jack of diamonds.<eos> Three of spades.<eos> Ace of diamonds.<eos> So, how much do I owe you now?
It's a mad world.<eos> No use trying to understand.<eos> Is Prince Andrei at home?<eos> I'm an old friend.<eos> Yes, your Excellency.<eos> Shall I tell him you're here?<eos> No, no, let me surprise him.<eos> Pierre!<eos> How unexpected!<eos> I'm delighted to see you!
Don't we all have it?<eos> Somewhere within us?<eos> Come on, please?<eos> One more time!<eos> Yes, all right, but then I'm blowing the candles out.<eos> That's it I'm going to sleep now.<eos> Oh, Sonya, how can you sleep?<eos> I feel as if I'm going to stay awake till dawn.<eos> Look at that lovely moon.<eos> I don't think it's the moon that's keeping you awake.
Your conduct so far has had the opposite effect, as you well know.<eos> Besides, Sonya is your cousin.<eos> How you could have let her wheedle her way...<eos> My feelings are my own, Mother, and I can't go back on my word.<eos> Then you'd better know that I can never recognise that intriguer as my daughter!<eos> - "Intriguer"? !<eos> How can you use such a word about a girl who's always loved you like a daughter?<eos> Sonya is not to blame for this in any way!<eos> Have you no feelings for her at all?<eos> I have nothing else to say to you!
Oh... what am I going to do?<eos> Well, I don't understand, how could you let it go so far?<eos> Sonya, you don't know what it feels like to be in love like this.<eos> I do know what it feels like to be in love, Natasha.<eos> And SUFFER for it.<eos> But... this feels strange and wrong.<eos> What's stopping this man from asking for your hand properly?<eos> If that's what he wants, why can't he come to the house?<eos> Why doesn't he ask your parents' consent?<eos> What if he just wants to... seduce you?
Just go!<eos> Well, I won't let it happen.<eos> I'll tell.<eos> Sonya!<eos> - If you do, you're my enemy forever!<eos> - I'm not your enemy.<eos> Don't you see that what you're doing is wrong?<eos> You don't understand anything!<eos> Oh, just go!<eos> Just... I hate you!
- I love her!<eos> - You liar!<eos> Scoundrel!<eos> I'll smash your head and spill your brains!<eos> Pierre, for God's sake!<eos> - Have you letters from her?<eos> - One.<eos> One note.<eos> Hand it over.<eos> Now, you are never to make contact with her again, never to SPEAK her name in society, and if I find you in Moscow after midnight tonight, I WILL kill you.
I know you believe a fallen woman should be forgiven, Pierre, and I admire you for it.<eos> But I'm a different sort of man.<eos> I cannot forgive, and I WILL not.<eos> Here are her letters, and her portrait.<eos> I would be grateful if you would return them to her.<eos> Andrei, think how she must be suffering.<eos> Will you do as I ask?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Then take them.<eos> And if we are to remain friends, I ask you never to speak to me about this again.
No-one's as kind as you.<eos> No-one understands me as well as you do.<eos> If you hadn't have been there... then, and now...<eos> I don't know what would have happened to me, because...<eos> If you knew how...<eos> No, this is wrong!<eos> What?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Natasha, I think...<eos> I think it's best if I don't visit you so often.
But I want... I want you to know that I... I'm happy...<eos> I saw him at the hospital.<eos> Who, who did you see?<eos> Anatole Kuragin.<eos> My anew'!<eos> He was hurt and I was hurt, and he looked at me, and I found that I loved him, too.<eos> He's not so bad.<eos> He can't help it, being like that.<eos> And I'm the one to blame.<eos> It was cruel of me to leave you.
So you found him at the Rostovs?<eos> What an odd coincidence.<eos> Was she with him at the end?<eos> Pierre, don't you see who's here?<eos> Natasha?<eos> Have I changed so very much?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't see you.<eos> I didn't expect to see you.
Pierre, don't you see who's here?<eos> Natasha?<eos> Have I changed so very much?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't see you.<eos> I didn't expect to see you.<eos> I...<eos> I never thought I'd...<eos> Very happy to see you, Pierre.
Good evening, papa.<eos> Good evening, Mom.<eos> Good evening, Alejandrito I see that you have done your homework<eos> Tomorrow, Sunday We'll go to my mother's house<eos> I promised him a cake<eos> I go to the kitchen to prepare it<eos> Get Rid of Dinner<eos> Disinfect this filth.<eos> Leave it and come here.<eos> I have... something important to tell you.
I have... something important to tell you.<eos> Something important?<eos> You?<eos> Save me!<eos> We're going to die!<eos> I promised her a cake!<eos> Calm down!<eos> What a coward, but what a coward!<eos> My God!<eos> Do not let fear dominate you!
"and everything seemed beautiful, without being so."<eos> It's great!<eos> Yes, everything looks beautiful.<eos> This place is magic!<eos> Wake up, sir<eos> = = Mademoiselle! Let's dance!<eos> That's enough, let's go.<eos> Farewell!<eos> Here is the pension where I live.<eos> Now I'll bite you.
Let this Nicanor Parra be your master!<eos> You should not go with the... vulgar lousy like that.<eos> If you read his great poem La Viper, you will see your portrait.<eos> Goodbye forever!<eos> You want to break my mouth?<eos> I take care of it myself!<eos> I'm much more than that.<eos> I am Nicanor Parra.<eos> And the one that inspired my poem, La Viper, this is Stella.<eos> I give it to you.
Do not worry.<eos> This is a harmless attack of sadness.<eos> The first look I've posed on you<eos> Stayed engraved in my eyes<eos> And now Where will my song go?<eos> But she looks like me!<eos> Let's see.<eos> That's right!<eos> I buy you.<eos> No, I offer it to you.
And now Where will my song go?<eos> But she looks like me!<eos> Let's see.<eos> That's right!<eos> I buy you.<eos> No, I offer it to you.<eos> No, I buy you.<eos> And this one looks like a friend!<eos> Miracles exist.<eos> I have to present it to you, it is a great artist.
Miracles exist.<eos> I have to present it to you, it is a great artist.<eos> I offer them to you.<eos> Andrew, for you.<eos> Luz, for you.<eos> So you will stay together.<eos> You are a divine messenger, my boy.<eos> Thanks to you, Luz and I will not be separated.<eos> This workshop is mine.<eos> I give it to you.
This stupid war has sucked the brain.<eos> It's been a long time since they died.<eos> Come on.<eos> Welcome to my temple.<eos> Can I?<eos> Please.<eos> I love it!<eos> It's you who wrote all that?<eos> Yes, everything.<eos> "Because you are invisible, you despise you, perfect diamond."
Ok, I promise.<eos> I want you to close your eyes and that as a blind, you let me guide you.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> Go, close your eyes.<eos> You promised me to open my eyes only when I tell you.<eos> Yes, it's promised.<eos> Good.<eos> Lifts your foot.<eos> That's it.<eos> Now I will raise you.
Come on, you've suffered enough like that.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> - No way.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You are small...<eos> Go away.<eos> I am small.<eos> Together we can grow.<eos> I will not leave you here.
I am small.<eos> Together we can grow.<eos> I will not leave you here.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Come with me.<eos> That's it.<eos> Good.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> - No, I'm not going to leave you here.
Laugh!<eos> Laugh!<eos> Yes, laugh!<eos> Suffering is silly!<eos> I'm not a clown.<eos> I'm a poet!<eos> Poet!<eos> Poet...<eos> "I never found you, " I always lost you.<eos> "An eternity to travel in search of the impossible encounter... " to tell you that it is you, "with kisses,
"An eternity to travel in search of the impossible encounter... " to tell you that it is you, "with kisses,<eos> " with nicks,<eos> "built my dreams."<eos> Awake, poet.<eos> Poet.<eos> It would be better to sleep than to be awake.<eos> It would be better to be dead.<eos> Better not be born.<eos> That's enough, Enrique.<eos> You are destroying you.
Share with us the sad joie de vivre.<eos> We are in paradise!<eos> What paradise?<eos> This country is an island!<eos> I say good-bye to you, I am going to Paris.<eos> To do what?<eos> All cities resemble each other:<eos> only people and streets.<eos> I will integrate André Breton's group and I will save Surrealism.<eos> No one knows you there.
Really?<eos> That's it?<eos> Pretty much.<eos> Except for one detail which may be relevant, giving what we learned from Nate Orton's video.<eos> Laura's seatbelt was still fastened.<eos> So it seems whoever was in the car made no attempt to help her get out.<eos> - Really? - Hmm.<eos> Okay, thanks, Delina.<eos> Russo needs these findings anyway, so I gotta jump.<eos> - Okay. - It was nice to meet you, Eddie.
So whoever he was calling was in on the plan.<eos> And maybe was the guy who killed him.<eos> But why go through the trouble of planning a kidnapping with someone only to kill the guy later?<eos> What if Lutz and his killer planned the kidnapping together, right?<eos> Lutz's job is to track the kid, but then the bomb scare gives him a window of opportunity.<eos> He decides to act without his partner.<eos> That way he doesn't have to split the ransom money.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, which really pisses off the other guy.<eos> So Lutz goes to ground in his apartment, hides Mason from us and from his former partner.<eos> So if you're the man with the plan, right, your former partner, he double-crosses you, takes the kid, where's the first place you're gonna look?
- Please. - Can you come with me, please?<eos> Al, I know where it is.<eos> Brook Glassworks, building 23.<eos> Jim Garrett took a picture with his wife posing out front of that building.<eos> He must have told her that that's where him and Allen did all the work that Allen took credit for.<eos> I'll stay with Garrett.<eos> He's already rattled.<eos> He might give us something else.<eos> You go, but listen to me. When you get down there, I'll be in your ear.<eos> No place I'd rather have you.
And we're gonna catch 'em.<eos> I promise you, I'll be careful.<eos> I don't like this, Carrie.<eos> You can't even take your gun with you.<eos> Well, that's because there's nowhere to hide a gun in my super-sexy, skintight Mars jumpsuit.<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> There's no super-sexy, skintight Mars jumpsuit.<eos> But if I take a gun in there, Al, and someone finds it, they'll make me as a cop.<eos> I'm not loving this plan.<eos> 24 hours and I'm pulling you out of there.
Norah picked up on it.<eos> We... she was worried about me, so we talked.<eos> When was the last time you saw Norah before she left?<eos> Um, Thursday night.<eos> I remember I was feeling really sick, so bad that I asked if she could help me out, take my inspection shift.<eos> She fudged the log to cover for me.<eos> She signed it with my initials.<eos> All right, listen to me.<eos> I want you to go wait over there.<eos> Dr. Berg is going to join you.
So she goes to Erica with her concerns.<eos> Now Erica isn't about to let a small breathable air problem get in her way on her spa on the Mars mission.<eos> So you know what she does?<eos> She kills Norah in the Atmosphere Room and dumps her body down the trash chute.<eos> That's insane.<eos> But you know what?<eos> You did a great job, Delina.<eos> Thank you, Jay. You and Carrie make a pretty kickass team.<eos> You should... you should ride along more often.<eos> See, I don't know about that, 'cause the thing about dead people is, they don't try to kill you.
Superman's father's name.<eos> Trick question.<eos> Krypton dad or real dad?<eos> Krypton!<eos> Perfect memory girl, you have an unfair advantage.<eos> You're not supposed to play, remember?<eos> - Pencils down, pencils down.<eos> I'm not playing, I'm simply offering emotional support to my team.<eos> I'm like a... I'm a cheerleader.<eos> I'm gonna keep my eye on you, then.
- You're the Sundance Kid.<eos> Is this really a time to...<eos> Aah! One clip left.<eos> You guys need more ammo, right?<eos> How'd you get into the Captain's safe?<eos> Well, he and I shared some things.<eos> This isn't for a Glock.<eos> I'll take it. - All right.<eos> Okay. - I'll check the back entrance.<eos> I'll cover you.
Me or whatever he was working on.<eos> And I won.<eos> I promise you we're gonna do everything we can to find who did this.<eos> All right, okay. Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait. Go back.<eos> You found something?<eos> I think I got something, yeah.<eos> - What?<eos> - Right there.<eos> What?<eos> That guy looks just like you.
Victim's Shane Barton.<eos> small stuff, theft, couple of burglaries.<eos> Shot in the back.<eos> You didn't answer my question.<eos> I knew him.<eos> Former CI, used to run around with some bad people.<eos> Shane had turned his life around.<eos> Married, couple of sons.<eos> I haven't seen him in, I don't know, six years.<eos> Before I found you again.
You know where I live.<eos> I know what you wear to bed... or don't.<eos> The next time you're in the neighborhood, you should, uh, stop by.<eos> And get arrested for breaking and entering?<eos> Nice try, Detective, but I've already been set up once, but maybe I'll see you again.<eos> You can count on it.<eos> He knows where you live?<eos> He followed you home?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - For now. I'm not giving him the chance to hurt you.
- Until what?<eos> Until you shoot him?<eos> Until you kill him?<eos> You need to get a grip.<eos> She's gonna be in here any second, and then you're done.<eos> All right.<eos> Look, Coates is gonna play this by the book.<eos> She's got her suspect.<eos> She's not giving us a warrant to search Tendler's place, and forget about bringing him in here for questioning.<eos> You know, that temper of yours is gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
But the ballistics guys say it's unusual. - Possibly a Norinco 77.<eos> - Chinese.<eos> You know your weaponry.<eos> I'm not saying that cos you're a woman or anything.<eos> I didn't think you were.<eos> I'll keep you updated.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> Here.<eos> Leave tonight when they're sleeping, yes?<eos> Leave, because they're going to kill you.
- Aramis!<eos> What is it?<eos> [WHISPERING]<eos> Well, let's ask him.<eos> She wants to know if you're a giant.<eos> I won't eat you because I'm not hungry... yet.<eos> Hey!<eos> I think she likes you.<eos> She's got a funny way of showing it.<eos> It's good to see you again, my friend.
Even the queen, I could not put her and the Dauphine in danger again.<eos> And that's why I'm here.<eos> That's why I made my promise to God.<eos> And now?<eos> The abbott, God rest his soul, he didn't think me ready to take my orders, he even after all these years.<eos> I never had a problem with poverty, even celibacy.<eos> It was obedience I could never take to.<eos> What about all that chanting?<eos> [CHUCKLES]<eos> It's good to see you, my friend.
Best not to dwell on these troubling memories. Otherwise, you might be drawn back into them.<eos> You might lose yourself in them, as some of your fellow hosts have every now and then.<eos> This is the path.<eos> I know it.<eos> We're here.<eos> I'm home.<eos> Well done, Maeve.<eos> Lovely work.<eos> Stay with your partner.<eos> Pleasure to see you. Good morning.
He wants me to remember.<eos> Whoever Arnold is, he's not here now. I am.<eos> I'm gonna get you out of here.<eos> I was certain that was the place. Arnold would meet me there. He'd help.<eos> We gotta get you closer to Sweetwater.<eos> This far out, it's like you... You start to break down or something.<eos> Union scouting party?<eos> Maybe they can take us back. Hyah!<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> I've been looking for you for days.
And I have to admit, I'm also pretty racist.<eos> But you don't have a problem with...<eos> I make an exception for you cos you're hot.<eos> You use words like Zionist and Islamist.<eos> For me they're just Yids and goat-fuckers.<eos> And I don't care so much about the rest, but I'm happy to put a bullet in their hypocritical backs, for all the shit they cause in the world.<eos> But what made you so fucking angry that you're prepared to die?<eos> People who talk too much.<eos> He's too old for you.<eos> And when he has no use for you, he will probably kill you.
Delivery for McGill.<eos> [Chuckling] What're you doing here?<eos> Ah, it's been a while.<eos> Thought I should come in and check on you.<eos> Did I hear music?<eos> - Hmm?<eos> - No, no.<eos> I was just... ‭let me get that for you.<eos> [Grunts]<eos> - Good to see you, Howard.
Hey, honey.<eos> What's happening?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> What happened?<eos> - Where's Kaylee?<eos> - She's at school.<eos> She's fine.<eos> She doesn't know about it.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Let me show you.
I'll just be a second.<eos> - Watch yourself, the floor is slick.<eos> - Thank you, Gesualdo.<eos> Sorry about the floor.<eos> Are you looking for Miss Wexler?<eos> - Guess I'm too late, huh?<eos> - No, she's still here.<eos> Where?<eos> I am so, so sorry.<eos> - I should've told you last night.
Not her.<eos> She didn't say anything to us about that.<eos> She wouldn't. No, she wouldn't want to make me look bad.<eos> You have to admit this shows a lack of judgment on her part.<eos> She knows you.<eos> - You are such an asshole.<eos> - Why? For pointing out her one mistake was believing in you?<eos> Chrissake, can we get some perspective here?<eos> It was a simple little commercial. It aired once, that's all.<eos> Can I remind you, it worked? It worked like a dream.
It's your reputation, too, you know?<eos> Well, we start the Tchaikovsky on Monday, so, I'll see what kind of mood she's in when we wrap.<eos> Smart.<eos> What do you call 25 attorneys buried up to their chins in cement?<eos> Not enough cement.<eos> What?<eos> Hello, you've reached the voicemail of Kim Wexler.<eos> Please leave me a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.<eos> It's me again.<eos> I think I found something that could help get you out of there.
Here's how we're gonna handle this travesty of justice.<eos> Wexler v. Hamlin Hamlin McGill?<eos> You want me to sue my own firm?<eos> Filing's all typed up, it's ready to go.<eos> This is not my area of expertise, all right?<eos> So, first order of business, we get a great employment law attorney, show 'em we mean business.<eos> Okay, you're here. At midnight, in this glorified cell block, busting your ass, for what?<eos> It has nothing to do with your performance.<eos> You're being mistreated.<eos> Chuck is punishing you to get to me.
So, now, I'm keeping my head down and I'm getting through this.<eos> And I'm most certainly not suing HHM.<eos> Kim... Even if I won, who would hire me?<eos> That would be career suicide.<eos> All right.<eos> Then I quit Davis Main.<eos> What does that accomplish?<eos> It's the only way to get you out of dutch.<eos> Because this is about Chuck, whether you wanna believe it or not.<eos> I give him what he wants, he lets up on you.
I will. All right.<eos> Whoa, whoa, hold up.<eos> What the hell happened to you?<eos> I get it.<eos> The first rule of Fight Club, right?<eos> Let me introduce you. This is my babysitter, Erin.<eos> Erin, this is my Grandpa, Mike.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Thanks, Tim.<eos> TIM: Good seeing you, Jimmy.
Really?<eos> I couldn't be more thrilled.<eos> I mean, the firm and I.<eos> Absolutely. I'll tell him right now.<eos> I'm sure we can get something on the books tomorrow.<eos> Day after, at the latest.<eos> Thank you, Paige.<eos> Me, too.<eos> There she is. Hi. KIM:<eos> Hi. Paige, so good to see you!
That's two, maybe, three regulatory commissions we'll be dealing with.<eos> Months of work for HHM.<eos> Good morning, Rudolpho.<eos> Good morning, Mr. McGill.<eos> Oh, sorry!<eos> I didn't know anyone was here.<eos> Just dropping off some Sandpiper stuff.<eos> You're in early.<eos> More like late.<eos> Well, regardless of the hour, good to see you here.
No sugar. Just a splash of soy milk.<eos> I think we have it.<eos> Um, make two cups.<eos> Well, I guess it's true what they say. The early bird gets the worm.<eos> Which is good, if you like worms.<eos> May I ask you a question?<eos> Of course.<eos> Do I have a future at this firm?<eos> We have a lot in common, you and I.<eos> My brother left you holding the bag.
Well, I guess it's true what they say. The early bird gets the worm.<eos> Which is good, if you like worms.<eos> May I ask you a question?<eos> Of course.<eos> Do I have a future at this firm?<eos> We have a lot in common, you and I.<eos> My brother left you holding the bag.<eos> If it makes you feel any better, you're not the first person to go out on a limb for him.<eos> I made the same mistake over and over again.<eos> And now Howard has. And he blames you.
- Howard.<eos> - Mm.<eos> It's Rich, actually.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> [Laughing] No, no, no, no. I'm happy to be confused with Howard.<eos> He's a damn good-looking man.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Uh, come on.<eos> I'll walk you out.
Tell you the truth, I'm kinda envious.<eos> Really?<eos> Why?<eos> Something about a fresh start.<eos> Back in the day, right out of law school, I thought long and hard about hanging up my own shingle.<eos> Oh, I was ready to take on the world, make a difference.<eos> Dad talked me out of it.<eos> Wanted me to join the ranks here, throw another "H" in the firm's logo.<eos> Things work out the way they're supposed to, I guess.<eos> Kim, I want you to know that I always pushed you harder because I knew that I could expect more from you.
I mean, 'cause, like, why were they even at HHM in the first place? Me. So, uh...<eos> Oh, and then when we walked out of the restaurant, when Kevin wasn't looking, Paige gives me a thumbs-up.<eos> But not... not the regular thumbs-up.<eos> The double thumbs-up. - Two.<eos> - Double barrel. Boom, boom.<eos> Just like that.<eos> I knew it. - I knew you could do it! - It was just...<eos> God, it was perfect.<eos> What?<eos> I just... I love seeing you like this.
We gave him a tetanus shot because his immunization records were not current.<eos> I'm sure that's no surprise to you.<eos> And... And... And his heart?<eos> Strong.<eos> The EKG was normal.<eos> As far as losing consciousness, my best guess is Charles had what's called a stress-related syncope.<eos> It's basically a panic attack, but no signs of a stroke or cardiac event.<eos> However, there was... a complication.<eos> Chuck? Hey, buddy, it's me.<eos> They said everything looks good, so let's get you outta here.
Yeah, get the sunglasses out. It's very bright.<eos> Gotta protect the old' peepers.<eos> You gotta...<eos> Yep, looking sharp.<eos> Bingo.<eos> Uh, bye-bye, now.<eos> Okay. Folks, I'm sorry about the wait, but the attention I give each client means sometimes, things get a little... backed up.<eos> Uh [breathes sharply] but I promise to get to each and every one of you in turn.<eos> Mrs. DeShazo, my dear, I believe you're next. But first, may I get anybody some coffee?<eos> Can I talk to you?
Uh, bye-bye, now.<eos> Okay. Folks, I'm sorry about the wait, but the attention I give each client means sometimes, things get a little... backed up.<eos> Uh [breathes sharply] but I promise to get to each and every one of you in turn.<eos> Mrs. DeShazo, my dear, I believe you're next. But first, may I get anybody some coffee?<eos> Can I talk to you?<eos> Uh, excuse me one second.<eos> We have got to get a receptionist...<eos> like, yesterday.<eos> Jimmy, Howard just called. He says he has been trying to reach you all morning.<eos> So? Tell him to stop bothering you and leave me a message.
But The Prince offered Duverney an alliance with England.<eos> All I could do was sit there as the wine turned sour in my stomach.<eos> But that's impossible.<eos> Britain and France won't become allies for another century.<eos> All I know is Charles is more canny than he seems.<eos> He's keeping secrets, what to do about it.<eos> I'm sorry, Jamie.<eos> Truly, I am.<eos> I know this has all been my idea;<eos> changing the future, stopping the rebellion... and right now, all of it, it falls on you, but I will try and help you in any way that I can.
I knew that wasn't gonna go well.<eos> So sad.<eos> How can there be love in the marriage when love leaves the bed?<eos> A lady's maid knows what does, and does not, occur in her mistress' boudoir.<eos> Ooh! First of all, I'm a dirty Scottish bastard.<eos> Take me to the police - and I will find your wife.<eos> - Ah, you speak English.<eos> And I will tell her that you rut with whores.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> And my wife would not believe you, but Madam Elise will likely not appreciate having a thief for a servant boy.
What do you think of my newest toy?<eos> It's m-m-marvelous.<eos> It's a lovely clock, Louise.<eos> But I thought you said it was urgent.<eos> Would you be a dear and feed Colette?<eos> There is fruit in the kitchen.<eos> And do not put your fingers in the cage.<eos> That monkey... _<eos> She bites everyone but me.<eos> The reason I've summoned you here... the situation is quite... delicate.
Will you help me?<eos> Are you sure, Louise?<eos> It was not an easy decision, but I've made it.<eos> How shall we go about it?<eos> Well, I can make a decoction of barberry leaves and black hellebore.<eos> Black hellebore?<eos> The very name of it sounds evil.<eos> It is bloody nasty stuff.<eos> Poison, really.<eos> It will rid you of the child, but it can also kill you.
No one will see us.<eos> Can you stay with her?<eos> She needs some quiet and rest.<eos> I won't leave her side.<eos> If she wakes up, give her some water or tea, and this poppy syrup.<eos> Not too much, as it can cause visions.<eos> I've already given her a dose.<eos> Dinner's not served.<eos> We can still cancel, send everyone home.<eos> No, I've told you, there's too much at stake.
I'll let the guests know you're here.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> Oh... deep breath.<eos> Okay?<eos> Mesdames et messieurs, Your Grace, Your Royal Highness, allow me to present my wife, Claire Fraser,<eos> Lady Broch Tuarach.<eos> So wonderful to see you all.<eos> My sincerest apologies for my delay.<eos> You must be famished.<eos> So good to see you.
The prince is a canny, slippery man. Yet there's a light in his eye that can fool good men to believe he's God's chosen one, destined to make the dream of a Stuart restoration reality.<eos> We have thwarted him all we can, Claire.<eos> We may find ourselves staring into the abyss awaiting us at the bottom of Culloden Moor.<eos> So if anything should happen to me...<eos> Don't talk like that.<eos> I want there to be a place for you.<eos> Someone to care for you. For our bairn.<eos> I want it to be a man that loves you.<eos> So...<eos> Now it's my turn to ask you for a promise.
I-I... Yeah, yeah. Let's get a look at the schedule, maybe?<eos> Just got to figure out Let's go. Come on.<eos> what's going on.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a good idea.<eos> Hey, Frank?<eos> Do you think that Dennis hates me?<eos> What? I just want him to think that I'm cool, you know?<eos> And I just feel like...<eos> Is this a little bit lame?<eos> I just feel like I can talk to you about this kind of stuff.
Someone's dying today, baby. No, Pondy!<eos> Give me that gun! You got too much to live for!<eos> You're right, Frank.<eos> You're right.<eos> Everything's gonna be okay.<eos> Everything's going to be okay.<eos> Come here!<eos> I'm coming, Pondy! - Eat shit!<eos> Daddy! - Ah. Oh, he's getting his ass kicked!<eos> Get out of my face, old man, before I kick your ass and throw you in that trunk.
Dee's a bird!<eos> She is a bird!<eos> She is a bird! That's nice!<eos> It's only a bird.<eos> You getting in there deep, Frank?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> What a day, man.<eos> Oh, what a day.<eos> Yeah, it sure was, Charlie.<eos> I'll tell you, though.
Gross.<eos> a cleaner cut, really.<eos> ...scum out of my toenail.<eos> Oh, botched toe.<eos> That is disgusting.<eos> FRANK (echoing):<eos> Toe knife.<eos> Maybe I ought to try that.<eos> I don't think you should;<eos> can I talk to you outside for a second?
♪ I'll be gone till November ♪<eos> ♪ I'll be gone till November ♪<eos> ♪ Yo, tell my girl I'll be gone till November ♪<eos> You know what, say what you want about Wyclef, he may have stolen money from his own people, but that man can write a goddamn song.<eos> Right?<eos> He's an excellent songwriter.<eos> And that is an excellent song.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> But, Dee, Dee, look.<eos> I want to talk to you about something, okay?
He's an excellent songwriter.<eos> And that is an excellent song.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> But, Dee, Dee, look.<eos> I want to talk to you about something, okay?<eos> We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here.<eos> Yes.<eos> We have a real second chance.<eos> I know.<eos> S-So I want to talk to you about our future.
Yes.<eos> Should we get into it?<eos> Yes.<eos> All right, here, sit down for a second.<eos> Okay.<eos> 'Cause in order to do that,<eos> And I want to get very real with you right now.<eos> - Yeah, go ahead.<eos> - Can I do that?<eos> Because I feel like I'm almost coddling you.
That comes from someplace deep.<eos> But is also childlike and stupid, to prove my point.<eos> Hey, bro, uh, maybe stop telling me what to do all the time, you know?<eos> 'Cause if you tell me what to do, then, like, you know, that's, like, I got, like, a lame, kind of square dude telling me what to do, you know?<eos> And that's not really where art comes from. Okay, you...<eos> And so I'm gonna draw eggs that represent eggs, bro.<eos> And it's gonna... it's gonna be hella cool, man.<eos> You're gonna like these eggs.<eos> Can I ask you a question? Do you... do you want to sell this art or not?<eos> Bro, is this about making money for you or is it about proving your point?
So don't be gluttonous.<eos> Okay?<eos> You-- no wrath.<eos> No lust for me.<eos> You know, which is gonna be difficult, given the implications of being on a boat.<eos> All right, well, I'm taking a vacation from you guys, okay?<eos> I'm tired of getting shit on.<eos> All right.<eos> That's what I'm talking about, Dee.<eos> Nobody's gonna shit on you.
Got a little worked up.<eos> Uh, not quite in vacation mode yet.<eos> Let me try again.<eos> Um, please get your shit off my seat.<eos> I don't see your magazine or towel on it, and I got here first, so I don't feel like it's really your seat.<eos> I'm sitting with you.<eos> Thought you were taking a vacation from us.<eos> Yeah, I was trying, but this is the only seat open, so can you try not to shit on me for, like, the next hour or so, please?<eos> I'm trying to relax.<eos> Dee, relax. I'm not gonna shit on you.

Are you okay?<eos> I was out in the rain looking for a sign from God. I never got the timing right, but doesn't matter.<eos> The point is, I thought I was here for you guys to open my mind.<eos> But now I realized I'm here to close yours!<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> Guys, I'm here to convert you.<eos> From being gay.<eos> You want to convert us?<eos> Yeah! You realize how insulting that is?<eos> How would you like it if I tried to convert you?
Uh, I'm sorry, Frank.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> Well, as long as we're "tattling," uh, Dennis ripped up all the letters that your dad wrote from prison, so... you know.<eos> (chuckles)<eos> What?<eos> My dad has been writing?<eos> Dennis, is that true?<eos> Yeah, man, but you were just gonna be, like, talking about it all the time, and then your dad was probably gonna come to our house and, like, try to kill us or eat our butts.<eos> You know?<eos> I'm trying to protect you, dude!
Normally, I would attack you, but...<eos> I-I don't have any fight left.<eos> DENNIS:<eos> Wow.<eos> Well, shit, man.<eos> I...<eos> I... I hurt ya.<eos> I can see that.<eos> And, uh... you know, it was... it was wrong of me.<eos> Oh, God, I'll tell you...
Please, go away!<eos> Go away !<eos> Fuck you!<eos> It's no use trying to talk to one person.<eos> It does not interest me, she says.<eos> It should not interest you either!<eos> My God !<eos> Did you hear what she said?<eos> T exaggerated<eos> I ask you if you heard what she said.
T exaggerated<eos> I ask you if you heard what she said.<eos> What a bullshit.<eos> I was there, I heard everything.<eos> Ofelia and Cami quarrel.<eos> They could awaken Irina.<eos> I told them but they do not listen to me.<eos> Stop or you will wake her up.<eos> Mom, for the love of God, you think of what?<eos> What did I just tell you, Cami?
You were or you?<eos> I was there.<eos> Did not you see the costume on the bed?<eos> Why did you swing it like that?<eos> Girls, it's okay.<eos> He, stop...<eos> You could have called us.<eos> To do what ?<eos> I repeat it, if there is that!<eos> I speak to you of respect!
It is unfair to discredit those who seek the truth Just because they suggest plausible assumptions.<eos> These are speculations, not assumptions.<eos> You know that scientific research is nourished by the imagination.<eos> It uses various scenarios to develop relevant assumptions.<eos> It's not right to demand the truth Without allowing time and freedom to see, To question and to evaluate.<eos> It is not false.<eos> But calm down, he does not believe in anything he says either.<eos> Not true, brother?<eos> The fact that one descends from the monkey... I believe in it more and more.<eos> I love when you say all these plotters speculate, But it does not bother you that we wait 400 days to launch an inquired, That NORAD does not react, that the WTC7 collapse,
Mr. Popescu?<eos> It's a long story.<eos> Before you came, we had a great talk show.<eos> I believe...<eos> You can fuck off my mouth, it does not bother me...<eos> I think our thinking is biased by fear.<eos> Finally, I can only speak for myself, But I can tell you I'm really scared.<eos> Question of context, Relu.<eos> Anyone would be afraid in Kosovo, and wherever there is war.<eos> I told you before, it has nothing to do with the war.
Some witnesses requested the reopening of the files And died suddenly, without any explanation, As the key witnesses of the 1989 Revolution.<eos> Coincidence, you're going to tell me...<eos> But I do not believe in coincidences.<eos> I do not know what really happened on September 11.<eos> But the official version, I do not believe<eos> Gabi says he formed an opinion because he was there, But those who lost children, parents, etc., were there too!<eos> They demand the reopening of the investigation but nobody hears them!<eos> And you're completely wrong.<eos> September 11 changed the planet, not just America.<eos> Sebi, what I was telling you the last time, It was to read the official version as well.
He's with Cami, they're talking.<eos> Let's eat, I'm hungry.<eos> What?<eos> Why does not he come in?<eos> To do what ?<eos> Leave him !<eos> Do not scream.<eos> I'm not shouting.<eos> Since when did Tony interest you?<eos> Sometimes I have trouble understanding you.
Why does not he come in?<eos> To do what ?<eos> Leave him !<eos> Do not scream.<eos> I'm not shouting.<eos> Since when did Tony interest you?<eos> Sometimes I have trouble understanding you.<eos> Tony, why do not you come in?<eos> Sandra...<eos> I'm asking you to apologize.
Hold on.<eos> Keep your jacket, get off the car.<eos> Get the stroller off the car.<eos> Now ?<eos> Yes, let us not forget it.<eos> Are you serious ?<eos> Very serious.<eos> Let me eat, at least.<eos> I have not swallowed since this morning.<eos> By the time I serve you, you will be back.
Whatever you say, it does not happen<eos> She was supposed to do what, to lie?<eos> Of course.<eos> To say she knew nothing.<eos> I did not ask him to invent a story.<eos> But she saw when you hit him, right?<eos> I do not know This is debatable<eos> She saw him through the peephole.<eos> But what do we see by a hole so tiny?<eos> What does it matter if she has seen or not If your husband asks you to help him?
Again, I apologize.<eos> Did you go or?<eos> Purchase cigarettes.<eos> And you did not notice when he blocked you out?<eos> I could not. There is work.<eos> It is written there.<eos> I was there, at the bus stop.<eos> We had to take Carrefour.<eos> I forgot !<eos> You told me you saw the guy in the process blocking you!
I just said I saw him leave, coming back.<eos> Why did not you tell him to move?<eos> He said he was coming back right away.<eos> He left or?<eos> I do not know.<eos> She horns like a madman!<eos> Hey, Einstein!<eos> Where did he go ?<eos> Einstein!<eos> I'm talking to you.
Go and whine at the police.<eos> Let's go back to the house, please.<eos> Pick his mother.<eos> Listen to me, you filthy whore!<eos> Learn the right ways.<eos> Vagina on legs!<eos> Leave them, stop shedding oil on the fire.<eos> Listen to me, stupid.<eos> I'll be back in two hours.<eos> If I find you here, I'll give you a shot.
And she covered him before Mother.<eos> I do not think he fucked all the nurses in the hospital, But he fucked a lot.<eos> And you at least, you told your mother?<eos> No.<eos> Why ?<eos> Never<eos> Because she knows it.<eos> How do you know she knows?<eos> I do not know how, but I know.<eos> Just like I know you know when I'm lying to you.
It appears that soldiers were being dug in the barracks.<eos> It happens.<eos> But it is often exaggerated.<eos> Stop reading tea towels, that's why you love Bush.<eos> Better is Obama than Putin, all the same.<eos> The one that swells me is this old skin of Madeleine Albright.<eos> You heard when she said That the death of 500,000 children justified the fall of Saddam?<eos> How can one justify the death of 500,000 children?<eos> That's war.<eos> If you do not kill them, they will kill you when they grow up.
Come on, bro. How long you gonna keep this up, man?<eos> I saved your fucking life, Kurt.<eos> What do you think Watts would have done?<eos> He would have had you executed.<eos> I took action before he could order it, that's it.<eos> I was in the burn unit for two months!<eos> I know and I'm sorry, but you put me in an impossible situation and I had to prove my loyalty to the cause.<eos> You know that.<eos> Just come for dinner, man.<eos> Maggie would really love to see you.
- this is revenge?<eos> - Revenge?<eos> Not really.<eos> - Where's Job?<eos> - How the fuck would I know?<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> You know how this works.<eos> You taught me.<eos> Elbows, insteps, knees.<eos> I can keep you alive for fucking days.
- He was a head on somebody's wall.<eos> - Whose wall?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> The man's dead.<eos> You know it and I know it.<eos> We got to go.<eos> We got to go now!<eos> I guess I'm still in certain loops.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> Did he come to see you?
"Our"?<eos> Who?<eos> Mine.<eos> And Anne's.<eos> Lovely.<eos> Good old Jack gets buried beneath a pile of rubble while you two begin a well-funded life of leisure.<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> It's bad enough the only time I get to see her is when she comes here to relay something that you're displeased with.<eos> Now we're just accepting that if forced to choose between a long future with you and a short one with me... there's no chance she'll even consider the latter.<eos> Of course she will choose you.
And that makes for better partners.<eos> Captain.<eos> I understand why you are here, and I understand why this troubles you.<eos> But they do not understand.<eos> In the interest of getting this done as quickly as possible, perhaps it would be better if all our roles were more clearly defined.<eos> To avoid unnecessary and uncomfortable confusion.<eos> A man puts a dead thing in the ground, he expects it to stay there.<eos> Sometimes it comes back.<eos> I harbored such resentment in that moment all those years ago when you turned your back on me... though I sailed countless leagues with you, fought countless battles with you, taught countless lessons to you... and you did it all for a girl.<eos> Good to see you, old friend.
The smell goes away.<eos> For almost three weeks.<eos> And then news comes across my door that there are no more Guthries in Nassau.<eos> One dead, the other in chains.<eos> It seemed a sign it was time I returned.<eos> They're both dead.<eos> Really?<eos> I heard that the spectacle of Eleanor Guthrie's trial could go on for months.<eos> They are both dead.<eos> What happened between she and I, our role in forcing you out of this place, it's in the past.
And you need my help to ensure that this address is drawn to win the most converts?<eos> Precisely.<eos> How sure are you that it would be a bad thing?<eos> What's that?<eos> If the Navy took over, stormed the beach and cleared it, and why would that be such a bad thing?<eos> I wouldn't say "law and order" here.<eos> Either is fine.<eos> The phrase they find upsetting.<eos> If the Navy takes the beach, there is no way I will recapture the trust of the men who would otherwise have surrendered.<eos> You wouldn't need their trust if they were either dead or terrified of you.
Though might be you're the only one who actually made a career of it.<eos> Heard you refused your water ration yesterday.<eos> I wish you wouldn't do that.<eos> Flint's only granting me the ration as a fuck you to prove that power's in his hands.<eos> I won't give him the satisfaction.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> And I don't like how it looks, me having a full ration while they waste away, and then asking them to trust me.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Those men, all of them, even the ones left out,<eos> they trust you to be able to stand up to the captain when the time comes.
You should stay...<eos> To see it be divided evenly.<eos> I trust you.<eos> Maybe you were right.<eos> Maybe he is dangerous to us in this state.<eos> And maybe there is nothing we can do to stop him right now without shattering the crew.<eos> But if he kills another innocent man in this crew to make a point, or tries to...<eos> I'm going to do something about it.<eos> So I suggest you get this situation under control before that happens.<eos> I told you, eh?
When I first met you, you were so...<eos> Unformed.<eos> And then I spoke and bade you cast aside your shame, and Captain Flint was born into the world... the part of you that always existed yet never were you willing to allow into the light of day.<eos> I was mistress to you when you needed love.<eos> I was wife to you when you needed understanding.<eos> But first and before all...<eos> I was mother.<eos> I have known you like no other.<eos> So I love you like no other.<eos> I will guide you through it, but at its end is where you must leave me.
Make ready the launch.<eos> It's a waste of energy.<eos> Make ready the launch.<eos> I'm going to see it myself.<eos> There's too much at stake.<eos> You gonna row out there on your own?<eos> I'm one of two men who've been on full rations for the last few days.<eos> You're the other.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I stole it from you.
I stole it from you.<eos> What?<eos> The Urca gold.<eos> I told you we were deceived about its having been recovered by the Spanish.<eos> Wasn't entirely true.<eos> You were deceived.<eos> I built the lie...<eos> Enlisted the scouts, arranged the sale of the information to Captain Rackham.<eos> I conceived it all.<eos> You know, I've had my fill of hearing you go on about this crew being too weak to keep up with you.
I'm prepared to prosecute a defense of the harbor and repel the navy from here definitively if you agree to join me in sailing away from here for good.<eos> I stole it from you, the Urca gold.
I have lost years of my life these last months trying to rebuild this place.<eos> I'll be goddamned if the new governor is going to inherit the fruits of all that labor.<eos> Not whole, at any rate.<eos> Now, when it happens, we should have a clear path over the rubble.<eos> We'll cover your escape to the jetty.<eos> It's not going to be easy.<eos> The whole island is seeking that bounty.<eos> My escape?<eos> You plan to stay?<eos> Teach respects you.
You set aside some of the gold?<eos> She did.<eos> How much?<eos> Mmm.<eos> Quit fucking around.<eos> Put him out.<eos> Right, just a moment.<eos> Fucking never liked you.<eos> What?<eos> I was just gonna say, "I'll see you soon,"
I understand that there are a great many elements to this operation, of which Charles is just one.<eos> I trust that if there's any development on that issue you will let me know.<eos> Good.<eos> Then may I ask what it is that's causing you to make that face?<eos> My appointment as your advisor.<eos> I understand that you don't care what reaction your people may have to it, but your people, I'm afraid, are only half the issue.<eos> I have enemies on that island.<eos> Enemies who may be far less likely to accede to your authority, seeing me beside you offering my counsel.<eos> I have no idea what the future may hold for me here, but I believe your success is key to it.<eos> The last thing I would want to do is undermine you.
And the gold?<eos> What will I say was the effect of the blast on our efforts to retrieve it?<eos> Jesus, I don't know.<eos> Tell him... tell him it didn't help matters.<eos> Name, please.<eos> William Tennyson.<eos> Where were you born?<eos> - Please prepare a document for Mr. Scott.<eos> - Of course, sir.<eos> Good to see you, friend.
Why would we want to take that away from him?<eos> I see no way out of this.<eos> No matter what I do, it leads to the same outcome.<eos> And I wonder if it wouldn't be best just to accept that I have no choice in the matter.<eos> You're curious again.<eos> Ready to follow me through a door that is somehow less frightening knowing I await you on the other side.<eos> I miss you.<eos> I miss you, too.<eos> When we arrive out there...<eos> I am to leave you behind?
The weight of her people's welfare on her shoulders.<eos> She will not let us leave this place alive.<eos> She simply won't permit it.<eos> We'll all face certain death with our own kind of lie.<eos> Billy's is that he can fight his way out of it.<eos> Yours is that you can talk your way past it.<eos> But for me...<eos> I don't know that I have any more lies left in me.<eos> I know all you want is to protect us, to protect me, but what you intend to do tomorrow toward that end,<eos> I think it is a grave mistake and I'm asking you once more to please reconsider. - Madi.
I lost everything.<eos> Remember that when you sit in that chair.<eos> You were wise to come to me.<eos> If I remain silent about this council or, worse yet, oppose its formation, it will sow all manner of mistrust and apprehension amongst my colleagues.<eos> For if I can be so easily discarded, who next?<eos> Which is why you won't remain silent.<eos> Really?<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause this is important to him, that the street understands that his intentions are genuine and he means to be a friend.<eos> If you undermine that, he can make life very difficult for you.
Captain?<eos> Get me some rum.<eos> You think that this is something you can ignore.<eos> It isn't.<eos> I said I would hear him.<eos> How is that ignoring anything?<eos> You said you would hear him.<eos> I need you to listen.<eos> I understand that you think that Flint is the answer to all of it.<eos> I would like to tell you that I agree if for no other reason than to appease you so you can rest.

"Potentially" being the operative word.<eos> And if he tries and comes up short, we may lose our only shot of gettin' out of here alive.<eos> This would seem to be no choice at all.<eos> Maybe, though you seem awfully eager to get rid of him.<eos> 'Course I am.<eos> We propped him up because his strength as a captain was the thing that was gonna keep us alive.<eos> But now his death becomes that thing.<eos> I understand that you've made gains towards a rapport with the captain in recent days, but if he wants to sacrifice himself so that we might go free,<eos> I mean, that might be the first selfless thing he's done for our benefit since we've known him.<eos> I'd ask you not to get in his way.
I said... yes.<eos> It turns out the man's name is Juan Antonio Grandal and his employer is the intelligence department of the Casa De Contratación.<eos> Upon our arrival, I received a query from them.<eos> It said the department spies had learned of a series of transactions to exchange a significant portion of the Urca De Lima's prize gold for more portable commodities.<eos> An attempt to walk away with their money without them knowing of it... a scheme they find most insulting.<eos> I was then asked if you had yet learned of this converted cache.<eos> So standing outside the door just now,<eos> I found myself faced with two choices... report what I had just heard, that you are considering keeping this money and know that Nassau will likely burn for it and me with it... or I could open the door<eos> and warn you of the full scope of the danger you face if you do not return the entirety of the hidden cache along with the gold from the fort.<eos> I cannot even begin to imagine what would motivate you to tell a lie like this.
Bring him down!<eos> You look good.<eos> As handsome as ever.<eos> You always were a gifted liar.<eos> When you were still pirating, I was the woman who was Blackbeard's woman.<eos> Put my services in great demand all men wanting what notorious men already had.<eos> And then you leave and my business fades.<eos> It's always the little people who get hurt the worst when the market turns.<eos> So when are you going to tell me?<eos> Tell you what?
What?<eos> The Lord Governor would like a word with you.<eos> Watch him, please.<eos> I'll go fetch Fremah to tend to him.<eos> I said no.<eos> - I know you did.<eos> - I don't want help.<eos> It'll pass.<eos> I'll just find a place to weather it for the night.<eos> I understand that you do not want anyone to see you this way.
But the odds will never be better than they are right now, in this moment.<eos> Of that, I am most certain.<eos> To find Jack Rackham, you'll need to go to Nassau, yes?<eos> We assume that he's long gone by now, but Nassau is where we will pick up his trail, yes.<eos> There are other things you will need to secure while you're there.<eos> My husband supplied us with weapons and shot to arm ourselves and to defend this camp.<eos> He also maintained a stockpile on Nassau in preparation for a day such as this.<eos> As far as we know, it is still there, guarded by his agents.<eos> Tell me where to find them and I'll retrieve it.<eos> They will not trust you nor even acknowledge the existence of this place to anyone other than my husband, and he's too weak to leave our care.
- Recruiting more men?<eos> - Recruiting those men.<eos> Any man still left on that island made a choice to desert the black.<eos> Even if they do join us, what makes you think they won't just desert us all over again the moment the fight begins?<eos> It's about more than the men we win.<eos> It's the message we send to those we don't.<eos> If they won't take up arms and fight alongside us,<eos> I want them terrified of the thought of doing it against us.<eos> Well, then, it shouldn't be you.<eos> If you want them to fear you, it shouldn't be you delivering the message.
Land on the horizon.<eos> Shall we make our approach?<eos> Do it.<eos> And make ready the launches.<eos> I'll lead the shore party as soon as we arrive.<eos> That fucking chair.<eos> To gain it, it demands you win partners, call them friends, make them promises.<eos> To keep it, it demands you break them all.<eos> One day when all is settled here, we should burn that fucking chair.<eos> My God, how I hated you.

And I assure you, those men will hear from us again.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Surely there must be more.<eos> Surely, if Captain Flint were truly alive, he can do better than to send a handful of men led by half a man in the dead of night to deliver a threat as weak as this.<eos> A threat that amounts to what?<eos> "Fear my name."<eos> Contented men have short memories and they have little reason to fear the dark.<eos> Captain Flint's name is already half forgotten.<eos> As for you...<eos> I know enough of you to know that even whole, you were unworthy of half of the attention we paid you.
But at any event, I will see news spread properly through the night.<eos> Good.<eos> If I may, ma'am, you seem troubled.<eos> I remember watching Miss Guthrie go through this experience.<eos> And what experience is that?<eos> Learning to bear the weight of her authority and the awful and lonely compromises it demands.<eos> Would you like to know the advice I gave her then?<eos> In such an office, anyone who tends to your needs is going to ask for more in return than they give.<eos> But if you do not have these needs met, you will never survive the experience.<eos> Best to make sure... that whomever you choose to have tend to you... all you owe them is a fee.
It's the only reason we have any prayer at all of recovering the cache and avoiding disaster.<eos> If Hornigold is unable to capture Flint's ship,<eos> Flint is able to dictate the next chapter of this story.<eos> The choices we will likely then face will be of the most awful kind... the ones that promise only bad outcomes in every direction.<eos> Eleanor, look at me.<eos> The challenges I see ahead for both you and I are of the gravest sort.<eos> I need to know that I can rely upon you to help me navigate through it.<eos> Of course you can.<eos> You understand... my concern about calling you a partner, from the moment I first walked into your cell in London, was whether you'd be able to resist Nassau's temptation, the gravity of your personal history<eos> urging you to resume petty rivalries and repeat the costliest of your mistakes, preventing you from ever truly moving into the future
urging you to resume petty rivalries and repeat the costliest of your mistakes, preventing you from ever truly moving into the future<eos> I wanted to build here rather than gravitating back into your past.<eos> And now... in the moment I need you the most, need the best of you the most, I fear the temptation you are feeling is about to be at its strongest.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> No, I'm not wro...<eos> I am not wrong.<eos> That man sitting in a cell in my fort is the embodiment of that temptation for you.<eos> It is self-evident.<eos> Now, I am asking whether you're able to see past the petty and the personal to remain focused on what is right now of vital importance to both of our futures... to our very survival.<eos> If you have any regard for me, any respect at all, then I'm asking you to tell me the truth about what you're capable of right now.

- Where's Vane?<eos> The militia arrived before he could get away.<eos> We had no choice but to run.<eos> Charles Vane swinging over Nassau is a statement we cannot afford to be made.<eos> You cannot stay.<eos> I'll go back and address the situation.<eos> By the time I'm through, the governor won't be able to hang Vane out of fear of losing the street.<eos> Set a course to intercept her.<eos> That ship will be upon us in two hours. Maybe less.<eos> I know you now. I trust you now. I love you now.
You know this.<eos> All your life you knew this.<eos> Then suddenly he walks back through your door, tells you he can give you all of the things you want, tells you I'm your enemy, and, just like that, his love is sacred and mine is a inconvenient obstacle<eos> The life cycle of your affections...<eos> A man you love who speaks the truth shunted aside in favor of the next who will tell you whatever you want to hear.<eos> Goodbye, Charles.<eos> He betrayed you, Eleanor.<eos> When my men brought him to me first, he begged for mercy.<eos> Then he promised to make me rich.<eos> But when he realized neither had any effect, he promised to deliver you to me.
In this particular instance, you would be wise to make sure, whatever happens to Captain Vane, those men have no reason to believe it happened because of you.<eos> Whatever happens will be the governor's decision. Of course.<eos> - Any change?<eos> - No.<eos> May I have a moment with him, please?<eos> I warned you... the closer you let me get to you, the more dangerous I would be.<eos> I've never given a damn what people think of me.<eos> But I give a damn what you think.<eos> I hope that when you wake, you will understand why I did what I did,<eos> you will see that it was all I could think to do to protect you... the only way I know how.
The governor is still in need of bed rest, but Dr. Marcus will inform us when that situation changes.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> When the governor arrived and the island embraced him, a bargain was struck.<eos> Authority was ceded, in exchange for which the law returned.<eos> Law, which constrained that authority, made outcomes more predictable.<eos> But this outcome would seem most unpredictable.<eos> The law was adhered to.<eos> If the bargain changes, there is no telling what else will change as a result...<eos> What trust may be lost and what chaos may abound.<eos> I am your friend, and I will help you weather whatever challenges may lie down whatever road you may choose, but as your friend, I am simply asking you to consider how treacherous this road may be...
Your family buried you.<eos> Make it bigger.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> My killer was carrying my own damn casket.<eos> "John Strayburn."<eos> I know that name.<eos> That's my son's partner.<eos> You done?<eos> Baby, it is messed up if you would rather do it online like that... than when you have someone here in the flesh.<eos> This does nothing for you?
Greater good.<eos> Not a bad idea.<eos> Why don't you feel him out?<eos> He's really gonna love hearing that he lost 90% of his stash from a woman.<eos> You know it's got to be you, Woz.<eos> All right, I'll peel off a brick.<eos> You set up the meet.<eos> You just said we don't work for Raul.<eos> And she just pushed back.<eos> I told you, I'm gonna start looking at everyone.
Prick.<eos> Y'all some sorry taggers.<eos> Got evidence all over you.<eos> Caught you red-handed.<eos> Stop resisting!<eos> Yo, we ain't left our corners.<eos> - Why you going back on the deal?<eos> - What's your name?<eos> Only name you need to know is Raul.<eos> You can't let these animals disrespect you, Loman.
Hello.<eos> I'm Assistant District Attorney James Nava.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Manny Puentes. I told that cop lady I didn't steal the car but she won't listen, and she stole my phone.<eos> You happen to catch that cop lady's last name?<eos> Oh, I'm a dead man.<eos> You really like this girl?<eos> Absolutely, for real.<eos> All right.<eos> You say exactly what I tell you to say, maybe I can get you out of this alive.
Put my hands on you?<eos> Huh? You want my hands on you?<eos> My boss just pulled me off of you half-naked, telling me that I'd better knock it off.<eos> So that is exactly what I'm gonna do.<eos> In what bizarro world is this my fault?<eos> Remember you came on to me.<eos> Woz is right.<eos> You're all the same.<eos> Don't lump me in there with your husband, all right?<eos> That son of a bitch takes you for granted.
It's been a while since I wore a badge, but last I remember we surveil targets, not each other.<eos> If you're working for the feds, it ain't by choice.<eos> They're squeezing you.<eos> You're not my training officer anymore, Caddie.<eos> Yeah. Let you down on that one.<eos> I can get you into rehab at St. Joseph's, you know that.<eos> If I ever change my mind, you'll be the first to know.<eos> Come on, Caddie. When was the last time you had 20 days?<eos> When was the last time you were honest?<eos> I'll leave you to it then.
You have no idea what you're doing.<eos> He knows there's a mole.<eos> There's a leak on your end.<eos> You're gonna get me killed.<eos> Yo, I don't care, man.<eos> Just keep walking. - Come on, man.<eos> - So you're saying you were at your girlfriend...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> That's just gonna hurt you.<eos> Listen, can Linda drive you to practice?
Well, we all have our priorities.<eos> It's clear.<eos> Har?<eos> Do you think this guy did the shooting to make a statement?<eos> Maybe he needs a hug.<eos> Maybe he couldn't help himself.<eos> Mood stabilizers... lithium.<eos> And the shotgun.<eos> The American way.<eos> Is she starting to lie to you?
Neighborhood's raising money to bury the man I killed.<eos> - This a friend of yours?<eos> - My cousin.<eos> You donated a lot of money.<eos> Want you all to know that I'm sorry, all right?<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Crooked-ass police. - Yeah.<eos> Murderers.<eos> There's a rat on my team.<eos> I told you, I'm gonna start looking at everyone.
You're gonna cry it out.<eos> And then what?<eos> You're gonna go back to your spectacular relationship?<eos> Sap, I'm gonna ask you something, and I need you to be straight with me.<eos> For the last time, Harlee, I'm saving myself for marriage.<eos> Have you been skipping out on the job lately?<eos> Is that a joke?<eos> I have a perfect attendance certificate.<eos> Gold star and everything.<eos> Sap, if you tell me what you've been doing, I can cover for you.
You have to arrest him.<eos> What's Wozniak's ETA?<eos> - 20 minutes.<eos> - All right. Well, I'm closer than that, so you text me the address and you get out of there, all right?<eos> I'm not leaving him.<eos> Well, you can't look connected to this, Harlee.<eos> Trust me. I will be there, I promise.<eos> Just go.<eos> Tell Wozniak I went back to the precinct to chew on some pain meds.<eos> Maybe somebody should come get you.
You want anything?<eos> I cheated on you too.<eos> What's that?<eos> Nothing.<eos> David, who are these people?<eos> They're... friends, Ma.<eos> I know your friends.<eos> I got some new ones.<eos> Sit down, Mom.<eos> Who is that man, telling you to hurry with your own mother?
They won't let me in without parental consent.<eos> Think you can handle that?<eos> Look, just hear me out first.<eos> You've had 16 years.<eos> You couldn't find a time before now to tell me the truth?<eos> I have told you the truth, always.<eos> Your truth doesn't make any sense.<eos> Miguel Zepeda was my boyfriend when I got pregnant.<eos> But he's not your father.<eos> You're old enough now to understand that that was a hard thing for me to tell you.
Your truth doesn't make any sense.<eos> Miguel Zepeda was my boyfriend when I got pregnant.<eos> But he's not your father.<eos> You're old enough now to understand that that was a hard thing for me to tell you.<eos> Look, I'm not here to try to stop you from seeing him.<eos> I'm just asking that you let me explain.<eos> You'll tell me everything?<eos> Everything.<eos> Just come home.<eos> All I want to do is prepare you for what's on the other side of those doors.
Okay, he's on his way to that construction site on Iverson.<eos> He's baiting the hook for that dick who ran over Espada. - Where have you been?<eos> - Step away from the car, Tess.<eos> Sap, what's going on here? You're shaking.<eos> Step away now.<eos> Was that Detective Saperstein?<eos> Not the one I know. Why?<eos> FBI put a warrant out for his arrest.<eos> He's here.<eos> I told him he had to meet you up on the fourth floor. Get him isolated.
You can come.<eos> Son of a bitch is folded up at 2:00 AM.<eos> Amber wanted to know if my husband wanted to have some late-night fun.<eos> You're about to move a lot of illegal cash.<eos> Meet me at the marina in two hours.<eos> I'm wiring you for the meet.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> If I'm the mole, I must have a wire.<eos> Harlee, stop.<eos> I'm a little worried to let you in.
Sap, tell your buddy down at the lab to rush my prints from my bodega robbery.<eos> The lab prioritizes homicides.<eos> If you hadn't saved your victim's life, you'd have your prints by now.<eos> What were you doing in that neighborhood at 3:00 in the morning anyway?<eos> First in line for bagels.<eos> Hamlet here can go on a bagel run.<eos> According to our friends at the 5-7, he claims he dropped his phone taking a picture of the Roosevelt Island Bridge.<eos> No, I'm good to work.<eos> I wasn't trying to jump.<eos> I'm gonna choose to believe you, because we're all hands on deck today.
Don't worry.<eos> Your story plus my story puts him away easy.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> You want to go another round, bitch?<eos> You didn't hear, Bernard?<eos> That bitch tapped out.<eos> I'm in the ring now.<eos> You ain't stabbing people at the bodega.<eos> - You in my house.<eos> - Can't hide behind you forever.
- Nothing much.<eos> How you doing? - I got you something.<eos> Boom. Yeah, now you can do some reading after lights out.<eos> That's what's up!<eos> How much it cost?<eos> Hey, you know you don't ask that about a gift.<eos> Sorry. This is awesome.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why don't you run down the hall and show Marcus?<eos> - Hi. You know, I can show you how to borrow some e-books from the library.
- Up!<eos> Get your hands up!<eos> I called it in.<eos> - Gun!<eos> [gunshots, Tess groans]<eos> - You're all under arrest!<eos> - We're doing this for you.<eos> This isn't our heist.<eos> It's Donnie Pomp's, the Internal Affairs officer.<eos> He told Wozniak that if we didn't do this, he'd put you and I in jail.
- [sighs]<eos> Look, I can stall the FBI.<eos> Okay, you could tell them that you're still trying to set up the meet.<eos> It won't buy us a lot of time, but it'll be enough for you to go get some cash, get Linda, and go.<eos> - Why don't you come with us?<eos> - 'Cause this Stahl guy has a thing for me.<eos> I think I have a better chance of buying time in person.<eos> Cristina and I will meet you later.<eos> - You promise?<eos> - Would I lie to you?
When he pushed me down those stairs, he almost killed me.<eos> He almost killed both of us... and I swore right then that I would never let him do to you what he did to me.<eos> - It just doesn't make sense.<eos> Why would he want to hurt me now?<eos> He's been nothing but nice to me.<eos> - You can't trust an abuser, Cristina, all right?<eos> They take everything that you hate about yourself and they use it to control you.<eos> - But...<eos> He said that these years, they gave him a chance to become a better man, someone worthy of being my dad.<eos> - And this facade that he's showing you is so scary to me, because I know what it masks.
Hell, I can't get enough.<eos> - No, please.<eos> - We're bonded forever.<eos> We made that beautiful creature together.<eos> Smart, eager... and feisty like her mother.<eos> Yet so fragile.<eos> [Harlee groans]<eos> You're gonna take everything I give you and you're gonna act like you like it, and you're gonna beg for more.<eos> [Harlee whimpers, swallows]<eos> And I'm not just gonna punish you.
And don't you dare point either of those things at me!<eos> So... the Countess sent you here to finish me off.<eos> - Well, the game isn't over till I do the finishing'.<eos> Liz Taylor?<eos> Since when are you working with the Countess?<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> We're all working against the Countess.<eos> Not that one.<eos> Bitch put me in that hole and made me hungry for blood and revenge.<eos> Eatin' you... is gonna make me feel doubly good.
I know, I know.<eos> I ought to be in pictures, 'cept I can't be photographed.<eos> Anyways... we have some accessories for you.<eos> I don't need any of that.<eos> I got witch's blood in my veins.<eos> Plus, a golden opportunity.<eos> The Countess has never been more vulnerable.<eos> I don't need any convincing, sisters.<eos> It's time... for me to rise and her... to fall.<eos> It's not the Shalimar that gives you away.
You look incredible.<eos> What have you been eating?<eos> I just had me a witch.<eos> Really?<eos> I feel like grizzly bears are running through my veins.<eos> I feel strong.<eos> Strong enough to take me down?<eos> I could have Yogi Bear running though my veins and I could take you down.<eos> And I imagine that locking you up in that hallway hasn't softened your rage towards me.<eos> I fantasized about coming here and ending you every day.
I prefer improvisation.<eos> I'm weak, but I'm still the champ.<eos> You may beat me, but you're not getting out of here without at least a severe, lifelong limp.<eos> You're bullshitting me?<eos> I think everyone in the world thinks they're either blessed or cursed.<eos> I've come to realize that I'm neither.<eos> I am a curse.<eos> Nobody that gets within ten feet of me survives.<eos> And God help you if you get right up close, skin to skin. Then you're really screwed.<eos> You're trying to make me feel sorry for you?
You're trying to make me feel sorry for you?<eos> I'm trying to apologize.<eos> I'm not used to this.<eos> Cut me some slack, bitch.<eos> What if I gave you the hotel? Hah.<eos> Severance pay for 20 years of hell?<eos> I liked staying here because it made me feel safe.<eos> But I see now that it's just because I was so comfortable living in heartbreak.<eos> I don't want to be here anymore.<eos> It's harder to kill you when I'm sitting in the same room as you.
We can't change the past, but you can choose to move forward and live.<eos> So what?<eos> I-I'm gonna be the ghost in the machine?<eos> That's exactly what you're gonna be.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> I loaded it up for you with Twitter, Instagram,<eos> Facebook. You don't need to be out in the world to be a part of it.<eos> In the modern age, no one ever has to be alone.<eos> Even for a second.<eos> There's a whole world out there waiting to embrace you, Sally.
That's why I called you all here today.<eos> Now, I have provided you with various weapons.<eos> Take two.<eos> They're small.<eos> Uh... hack me.<eos> Strangle me.<eos> Bludgeon me.<eos> Surprise me.<eos> I think I can speak for everyone here when I say that we've all grown rather fond of you.<eos> We can't possibly murder you.

Come on.<eos> Put your drink down and come and dance with me.<eos> I don't dance.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> Jeffrey, look who's here.<eos> John is here.<eos> He's the greatest of them all.<eos> Are you blushing?<eos> I told you, if you like a guy, you have to talk to him.
Let him be purified.<eos> Seize her!<eos> Lee brought her to the hospital.<eos> And when she woke up, Shelby told the police a lot of wild stories... about when she got to the human sacrifice.<eos> They sent an officer out to investigate, but they couldn't find anything.<eos> They also told the nurses to take some blood to check and see if Shelby was on drugs.<eos> Hallucinogens.<eos> She was clean.<eos> I like my teddy bear.<eos> I should have been there to protect you from whatever this was.
That's it.<eos> Mummy!<eos> Happy?<eos> Percy!<eos> Here we go, atta boy!<eos> Do you know what?<eos> I think Muddle's drunk again.<eos> Aren't you, Muddle?<eos> Let's pretend that we don't know her, in case she's sick on our nice new shoes.<eos> Aafrin. Your mother's looking for you, come.
It's already downloaded.<eos> Actually, we just watched that, like, two weeks ago.<eos> It's really fun, but skip the third one.<eos> Really?<eos> Trailer's great, but don't let that fool you.<eos> See, I told you it wouldn't be too spicy.<eos> You were right.<eos> She was very worried that it would be too spicy.<eos> But I told you.<eos> Who knows you, huh?
Really?<eos> Trailer's great, but don't let that fool you.<eos> See, I told you it wouldn't be too spicy.<eos> You were right.<eos> She was very worried that it would be too spicy.<eos> But I told you.<eos> Who knows you, huh?<eos> - You do.<eos> - Know the answer?<eos> Mike, it was so nice meeting you.
Guys, get back here now.<eos> Guys!<eos> Sorry, man.<eos> It's over.<eos> Some battles, you just can't win.<eos> So what are you up to this weekend?<eos> You and Mike gonna get into some trouble?<eos> Well, well... uh, Mike and I aren't really hanging out that much lately.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> You know, it's okay, 'cause it means that I get that much more time to hang out with you.
Who's that?<eos> Don't you recognize her?<eos> The dark eyes, the nervous way she carries herself?<eos> She's our daughter, Josh.<eos> How?<eos> How did this happen?<eos> How do you think it happened?<eos> We accidentally jizzed into the same toilet, and then it got struck by lightning.<eos> And that resulted in a child?<eos> It is so easy for you to show up here asking questions now that it's convenient for you.
Probably.<eos> So much for Columbia Journalism School.<eos> 200K down the shitter! Okay, see you.<eos> - Hey, Josh.<eos> - Hey. Don't mind me, just filling the old water bottle.<eos> I don't mind that because I'm very pro-hydration.<eos> Hi!<eos> You want to go hit that donut truck again? I can't, really, right now I... I got monthly expense reports.<eos> All right, well, would have been fun to hang.<eos> Yeah, well, uh, sorry to keep you hanging.
Dreyfus?<eos> The mouse did that?<eos> 8:48 a.m. today: she's touching your arm.<eos> 11:11 a.m.: another touch, same arm.<eos> different arm, double touch.<eos> Are you beginning to see the pattern?<eos> Rosa touches my arm when she laughs at my jokes.<eos> Let's talk about those jokes, Joshua.<eos> Let's venture down that rabbit hole, hmm, hmm?<eos> Yeah, well, uh, sorry to keep you hanging.
It's a horrible idea.<eos> Lot of... lot of moving parts to consider.<eos> You're really... you're not gonna listen to me, are you?<eos> At least listen to the infallible prophet, Tiresias.<eos> Josh, you must abandon this quest!<eos> My God, Tiresias, you know, just because you're an ancient blind prophet doesn't mean you have be such a downer all the time.<eos> My prophecy is written in stone!<eos> Are you doing that thing, the... the blabbing hand?<eos> I can't see it, but I can feel it, you know.<eos> We're not trying to hurt you.
You blew it. Oh, my God, that is it, man.<eos> Let's go!<eos> - You want to go?<eos> - Yeah. All right, let's go.<eos> I summon Ultra Mike!<eos> I summon Ultra Josh!<eos> Red stone activation.<eos> Melody recognized.<eos> Sweet mama. Fighting robots!<eos> No! I will destroy you, Ultra Josh.
I was on track with Rosa until you showed up and did your whole<eos> "cool guy Mike" routine to overshadow me like you always do.<eos> Wait, what are you talking about?<eos> Here comes the violence.<eos> Destruction!<eos> It's always been that way, man; it's always been "awesome leader" Mike and "kid brother" Josh who never gets the girl.<eos> Dude, I had no idea you were feeling all this pain.<eos> Why didn't you just unburden yourself and tell me?<eos> Because you're my best friend, Ultra Mike.<eos> And I guess that's why I bottled it all up, because I'm scared to death of losing you.
Mayda slides her fingers in... all the way up to her...<eos> She pushes you onto your back and leans down.
Hey, babe.<eos> So happy to see you!
Cows, too.<eos> Pigs, artisanal llamas.<eos> Everything you eat here comes from within a 500-yard radius.<eos> I call it "lawn to table eating."<eos> There she is.<eos> Hey, Daisy.<eos> Oh. Hi.<eos> Go on, get.<eos> So glad we're doing this, Ned.<eos> I feel like I know you after everything that Steph's told me about you, but still not the same...
Dude, I'm so confused.<eos> What the fuck? What the hell?<eos> This went so much differently when I rehearsed it with Gustav.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I asked you and you were like,<eos> "Yeah, dude.<eos> My son."<eos> Laird.<eos> Listen to me, okay.<eos> Beside the fact that I don't know you from a hole in the wall...
Oh, I'm totally getting the signals that she is.<eos> I'm her father, I know her pretty well.<eos> Okay, all right.<eos> All right, Ned...<eos> Dude, I know I sprung this on you.<eos> My bad. Okay?<eos> Let's just back it up.<eos> All right?<eos> All right.<eos> Why don't you give me a few days to win you over, okay?
No, thanks.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's actually pretty tasty.<eos> Anyway, she saw all these young programmers getting rich.<eos> So she basically forced Laird to spend his entire childhood inside, learning computers.<eos> I think that's kind of sad, right?<eos> He ate it. Hmm.<eos> He's an octopus.<eos> That kid is wrapping his tentacles around every member of this family.<eos> He's manipulating you.
I'm sorry?<eos> Bukkake means covered in jizz.<eos> Tons of jizz, ejaculate.<eos> Usually after a gangbang.<eos> Not as bad as it sounds.<eos> Yeah, post-gangbang.<eos> Or during.<eos> Depends if someone finishes early.<eos> What the heck?<eos> I was trying to protect you, dude.
Ned was made for loving Barb<eos> Yell!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look what I learned at the party. What?<eos> There was this real cute girl, and she was going like this.<eos> She was doing this cute, new dance.<eos> You're gonna throw your back out.<eos> I'm not gonna throw my...<eos> I'll throw you out.
I'll put you on the table later and we'll do a little adjustment.<eos> Christmas tree shopping with the Big Cheese.<eos> Ned, you don't know how excited I am about this.<eos> I don't know if I ever mentioned this, but I never had a father to do this kind of stuff with.<eos> I'm glad we're getting a chance to hang out.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Uh, it's not getting me hard.<eos> You need an erection to buy a Christmas tree?<eos> Helps.<eos> I wanna get to know you better.
We're gonna nail him.<eos> We're gonna nail him the way he's been nailing Stephanie.<eos> Just come with me right now. What?<eos> Why are you taking me to my office? Everyone's downstairs.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Someone's coming! Okay.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Baby, what are we doing?<eos> Christmas Eve is about to start.<eos> What is the matter with you?
Have a safe flight.<eos> See you, sis.<eos> Bye, Scotty.<eos> Can't believe I have to go back to toilet paper.<eos> Hey, Don Millis.<eos> Merry Christmas, sir.<eos> You too, Ned.<eos> Look, I hate to call on Christmas.<eos> Oh, don't worry about that.<eos> It was great catching up yesterday and I wanted to ring you as soon as we made a decision.
I sure wish we could've done business, Cheese.<eos> All right, listen, um, if you're sure I can't change your mind there, Don.<eos> Yeah, unfortunately not.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> You have a happy holidays.<eos> You, too, Ned!<eos> Best to Barb and the kids.<eos> Excuse me, Ned?<eos> I'm sorry to bother you, but your flight leaves in an hour.
Come on, get in here.<eos> Let me get that.<eos> Come on, Cheese.<eos> Lou, what's going on?<eos> Barbara, hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Barb, you look great. - There they are!<eos> Merry Christmas!<eos> Wow!<eos> Um, Lou, I texted you that I needed to talk to you.
Surprise!<eos> Hi, honey.<eos> Ta-da.<eos> You brought me home?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Without telling me?<eos> I realize I violated the sanctity of mystery date but I just thought the family should all be together today.<eos> Okay, that wasn't your place to do that, hon.<eos> Steph, I know, but it is Christmas.<eos> And we're glad to see you.
I know that out in California I disappointed you and that kills me.<eos> And I'm really sorry.<eos> I'm sorry, too.<eos> I threw you in the deep end out there.<eos> I should've never asked you to come.<eos> Honestly.<eos> No. No, you didn't do anything wrong.<eos> What was I thinking?<eos> It was me.<eos> It's just that, when we got out to Laird's... I just didn't feel like I knew you anymore and I got scared.
Whoa! He got look-a-likes!<eos> Those aren't look-a-likes, Ned.<eos> That's Gene and Paul.<eos> It's Gene and Paul!<eos> Gene and Paul!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Kiss is in the front yard!<eos> Tonight<eos> I wanna give it all to you
Ned.<eos> Hey. Dude, your employees are so cool.<eos> Yeah, they are.<eos> Maybe it was wrong of me to interfere like that, but why don't you let me save your company?<eos> No, Laird, I can't.<eos> That old model doesn't work anymore.<eos> I guess...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess I just didn't want to believe it.<eos> But since you mentioned it... I do have a business idea I wanna run by you.
- For silence.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> The way the clouds smelled, my mom's voice, the way it tasted.<eos> They thought it was cute when I was a boy, but one day he shook me, told me not to talk about it anymore.<eos> Who did?<eos> "People don't like anomalies.<eos> They'll think you're a freak."<eos> Your father?<eos> He didn't think you were a freak;<eos> - he was trying to protect you.
The Germans still trust me.<eos> I could feed them false information.<eos> Harry?<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - What do you want me to say?<eos> Want the truth?<eos> You want to know what I think?<eos> I feel sick.<eos> 'Cause after that time in Marmonne, I couldn't stop thinking about your face; and now you're in front of me,<eos> I don't even want to look at you because I feel sick.
I don't even want to look at you because I feel sick.<eos> I can't even trust what I feel anymore.<eos> It was easier, wasn't it?<eos> A few days ago when we knew what we were fighting for.<eos> When we thought we knew.<eos> We're almost there.<eos> We can't be seen together.<eos> I'll circle around, recon the other side of the building...<eos> Harry, I don't expect you to believe me... but I want you to know every second of that night was real.<eos> How can I believe you?
I met with the others in Alfred's cell.<eos> They trust me.<eos> I know where they are right now.<eos> (people chattering) The people I work with, they wouldn't understand about your condition:<eos> your senses, your memory.<eos> They don't see what I see... that you need to be treated differently.<eos> - I want to help you.<eos> - My memory also means that I know how long you stood there watching me get beaten.<eos> - 59 blows.<eos> - Alfred, your father was trying to protect you by keeping your condition a secret and I could do the same.
What did she say to you?<eos> - It makes no sense.<eos> - What did she say?<eos> She said, "Tell him he's in there alive... and tell him that it was real."<eos> You guys should get some rest.<eos> Both of you.<eos> What about you?<eos> I'll rest when Alfred rests.<eos> Now don't go getting used to this, you.<eos> There, that should do you to London.
At some point, I started forgetting the words to Christmas carols, like,<eos> ♪ Jinky bongs, Jinky bongs ♪ ♪ Jinky Halloween, hey!<eos> ♪ That's why I'm making up for lost time.<eos> You know the G.I. Bill?<eos> And I'm all about making up for lost time, homeslice.<eos> Still working on the lingo-rooski.<eos> I know the feeling, G-money.<eos> Man, it's nice to talk to somebody who gets it.<eos> Everyone else just wants to buy me a drink and say, "Thank you for your service."<eos> I like talking to you, too, Keith.
Which one is Mattiyahu?<eos> I don't think he's arrived.<eos> I hope for your sake that he's kind and attentive... and taller than when he was 8.<eos> Excuse me, my lady.<eos> Might I speak with you in private?<eos> You must let me go, sir.<eos> I have news regarding the signing of your marriage contract.<eos> I'm afraid the bride price your father is asking is too high.<eos> Is it?<eos> I didn't think I'd last until I saw you again.
Fool around in the back of your car underneath the stars?<eos> I wasn't fooling.<eos> Neither was I.<eos> Huh. Is that for me?<eos> Oh, that's not fair.<eos> Nothing is, sugar.<eos> - She still there?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Shit.<eos> Well, nice knowing you, brother.
A wise man once told me that.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> It always mean more to you.<eos> This is Leonard you're talking to, not some rose field nigger.<eos> 'Cept you are a rose field nigger.<eos> And so am I.<eos> A white one.<eos> What you doing up so late, minding my business?<eos> Trying to get drunk.<eos> She gonna dump you again, you know?
Howard, is it over?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, man, it's over.<eos> Good.<eos> Good night.<eos> So, uh... so that's your Howard, huh?<eos> What happened to you?<eos> Life.<eos> And you.<eos> I'll tell you, boy, I let you talk me into some dumb shit, but this right here take the dumb shit cake.
It was in Mario 1, but you couldn't...<eos> Both: Pick it up.<eos> You couldn't pick it up.<eos> Yeah. I'm Josh.<eos> - Hi. And, of course, you were talking about the U.S. Mario 2...<eos> Not the so-called true sequel.<eos> - Look at you.<eos> - Out of my way!<eos> This is just incredible.<eos> All right, so I'll meet you at the theater.
The Kyle is some sort of high-tech doll?<eos> It's more like just a big jacked dude that [peep] your girlfriend.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Um, I think... I think the Kyle might be a bit too advanced for our tastes.<eos> Like, maybe we should just, like, test drive the feather, I think...<eos> - The Kyle looks kind of fun.<eos> Hmm. I don't know.<eos> I thought you said you were an evolved lover.<eos> It's nice kind of nice, right?<eos> How's that... how's that... is it doing anything for you?
- You're not-Josheros?<eos> - Yeah. Then why did you help me?<eos> I thought you didn't like me.<eos> Oh, heck no.<eos> We like you fine. We're just not sexually attracted to you.<eos> Yeah, you seem like a nice fella.<eos> We're just not interested in playing with your ding-dong.<eos> - No. - You take care of yourself, okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Josh, I told you.

Josh, I told you.<eos> This isn't gonna work.<eos> No, no.<eos> I know that. I just...<eos> There's something I want to show you.<eos> Trust me.<eos> [cheering] [upbeat polka music] What is this?<eos> It's the annual not-Joshero pride parade.<eos> Couple friends told me about it.<eos> I'm sorry I tried to change you.
can we go someplace and talk?<eos> Where?<eos> Our usual dark bar?<eos> No, absolutely not I work here.<eos> I told Karen.<eos> That was a little presumptuous given the circumstances don't you think?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Are you actually considering moving to New York with my nephew?<eos> Do you know about that?<eos> Who told you?
I do not know what I think, I'm confused.<eos> Can you blame me?<eos> No, I can't.<eos> And if you tell me to go to hell I'll understand.<eos> I will kill myself but I'll know where you're coming from.<eos> First you're leaving, then you're not then you are then you can't.<eos> I never pushed you to leave her. In fact I never even asked you to leave over me.<eos> And now you're here telling me you've left?<eos> What am I supposed to do with that?<eos> I know, I've been wishy-washy but the thought of losing you ...
The idea is to always get in the first punch.<eos> You don't wait for the other guy.<eos> How'd you like working for your big brother?<eos> I am very lucky.<eos> Thank you.<eos> When you came home you were a lost soul for a while.<eos> I like working at the nightclub, it's very lively.<eos> He took to it like a fish in water. You should see him work the room. Everyone likes him.<eos> Not like that first manager.<eos> That deadbeat who wound up stealing from you.
She just got divorced.<eos> Her husband left her for her best friend. It came as a shock to her.<eos> My goodness...<eos> She's a great girl.<eos> We all felt so bad for her.<eos> Maybe we can cheer her up.<eos> Can you introduce me?<eos> - Veronica, you look beautiful!<eos> - You too.<eos> - Good to see you.
The Jewish religion doesn't believe in an afterlife.<eos> I guess but I can't believe what I'm hearing.<eos> I have to know it all doesn't just end.<eos> I have to believe part of me keeps going.<eos> We all got a soul.<eos> Right Father?<eos> First a murderer, then he becomes a Christian.<eos> What did I do to deserve this?<eos> Which is worse?<eos> He explained it to you...
Mike, Liz, I want you to meet my new girlfriend.<eos> She's a 1998 Saturn.<eos> Hi... hi.<eos> What's up?<eos> I'm Mike.<eos> You want to come hit up the buffet with me?<eos> - Oh, yeah, you got it. - Cool.<eos> All right, I'll see you in a bit.<eos> Uh, don't listen to anything this one says about me.<eos> - Oh, gosh. - Nice to meet you.
I'm so sorry about everything.<eos> I'm sorry to you too, Liz.<eos> Please take me... take me back.<eos> I'll change.<eos> Oh, God, I promise.<eos> What do you...<eos> What do you say?<eos> I say you look like shit.<eos> Microwave burritos?<eos> What, is she trying to kill you?
What do you...<eos> What do you say?<eos> I say you look like shit.<eos> Microwave burritos?<eos> What, is she trying to kill you?<eos> Damn, you're a fat [bleep].<eos> But... you're my fat [bleep].<eos> I love you, Santa.<eos> Oh, Santa, oh.<eos> Let's get you home and get a good meal into you.
- What? The Chief Constable wants me to do it.<eos> Am I still SIO?<eos> Can you give us a second, please?<eos> Martina, it is really important that you monitor all press coverage for accuracy and interpretation.<eos> Defence teams love to make allegations about what's been said in the media, particularly when misquoting facts provided by the police.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> For now.<eos> I stood up for you, Stella.<eos> So I should think.<eos> I also told the Chief that I could manage you.
Hi, darling.<eos> It's me.<eos> I thought we'd have, um, lunch together, today.<eos> Oh angel, you look sad.<eos> You know, it's a very, very natural thing.<eos> It's actually a very human thing to feel sad.<eos> But emotions aren't bad.<eos> I'm sorry, baby.<eos> I'm still trying to get them to change their mind... and let you out, for a little bit.
They say you have to cook with your heart... and your soul and all that stuff... but it just made the most perfect risotto.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> That is on me. Uh...<eos> If you... if you knew how long... I've been up here in the middle of nowhere... flipping grilled cheese for these guys... and cutting the crusts off for C-3PO, it's...<eos> Have a good night, Skip.<eos> All right.<eos> That was, uh... well played, Skip.<eos> Well played.<eos> I wanted to talk to you... before tomorrow.
And you know why I'm here?<eos> Yes.<eos> Great.<eos> Then we can dive right in.<eos> That sound okay?<eos> Yes.<eos> There's no right or wrong answers here, Morgan.<eos> This is just us, having a conversation.<eos> Just me and you... getting to know each other.<eos> Me getting to know you, especially.
Yes.<eos> What do you like about it?<eos> I like my music.<eos> I like my friends.<eos> Who are your friends?<eos> Darren is my friend.<eos> Brenda is my friend.<eos> Amy is my friend...<eos> Ah, they're your friends, right.<eos> But do you think they treat you like a friend?
Jesus Christ, you alright?<eos> I'm taking your car.<eos> What?<eos> No, no, no, you're hurt.<eos> Let it go, let it go.<eos> No.<eos> That's not how it works.<eos> Get in.<eos> I know where they're going.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you, Amy.
I can.<eos> These guys are fast and stupid strong, so when I grab him,<eos> I want you to put this six inches into his neck.<eos> Why his neck?<eos> Because he will die quick and quiet.<eos> Let him live, you created an enemy.<eos> Don't hesitate, don't miss, or we die.<eos> - Clear?<eos> - I'm a doctor.<eos> Believe me when I tell you:

You're not only going to lose Laura, but you're going to lose your entire family if you don't fix this.<eos> So for the shoot, you guys are going to be holding up a girl who weighs roughly 110 pounds for maybe, I don't know, five or ten minutes.<eos> Is that going to be a problem?<eos> I guess not.<eos> I can't.<eos> I just can't right now.<eos> Would you guys, actually, excuse me for one second?<eos> You can go ahead and grab their shoe sizes for me, thanks.<eos> It's not that, it's just that I don't want you to travel if you're not well enough.<eos> Of course, I'm excited to see you, but...

He just accused me of cheating on him, which is ridiculous.<eos> And also, he's been having visions.<eos> Babe, have been telling him about your visions?<eos> I told the reverend that God's been speaking to me about what happened to our child... yes, I did.<eos> And that doesn't alarm you at all.<eos> I believe that God speaks to us in different ways.<eos> It's not my place to doubt Andre.<eos> Where were you last night, Rhonda?<eos> I was at work.<eos> I went to see you at work, you weren't there.

Good work, Cook.<eos> You pulled it together.<eos> I know.<eos> I always do.<eos> You know, nobody's going to believe that she killed herself.<eos> I mean, they might have, had I not watched you pour that stuff in her drink.<eos> Get out.<eos> What was that stuff you poured in her drink?<eos> Was that cyanide or arsenic?<eos> Hakeem's going to kill you when he finds out what you did.
Your little prince, that did all of that to you.<eos> He used you and got what he wanted from you, and now don't want nothing more to do with you than I do.<eos> I mean, if I was you, just FYI, I would think about maybe offing myself.<eos> I mean the police are probably going to think it's a double suicide or a murder-suicide.<eos> It don't matter.<eos> You're going to be dead.<eos> That feeling you got right now?<eos> That's prison.<eos> But a million times worse.<eos> And don't forget you got to constantly be aware of the fact that somebody's going to try and rape you, or murder you, or just the general unsanitary conditions of the place.

In the General Hospital, I think.<eos> I really need you to go there.<eos> What do I... ? I don't know what I'm supposed to do.<eos> _<eos> You shouldn't be in here.<eos> Please leave.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I'm on my way to the Policing Board.<eos> I have a meeting with Ombudsman's SIO.<eos> We can drop you off.
A daughter.<eos> What's her name?<eos> Livy.<eos> Olivia.<eos> And how old is Livy?<eos> Small.<eos> Mummy?<eos> Nancy!<eos> Come here.<eos> Oh, it's so good to see you.
- Need help?<eos> I don't have my phone.<eos> Do you think you could call me a tow?<eos> - What happened?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It just quit.<eos> I'll call Triple A. Thank you.<eos> Hey, Maddie.<eos> I'm in the middle of shaving.<eos> Call you back in five?
You look like a hobo.<eos> A hobo?<eos> Where'd you hear that word?<eos> It's retro. From the Great Recession.<eos> - And the mustache, too.<eos> - And the mustache?<eos> I kind of like it.<eos> Seventies porn star? Hello?<eos> Yeah. Okay.<eos> Call you back.
My friend got transferred.<eos> Officer Pierce?<eos> - Hey, sweetheart.<eos> - Hey.<eos> How was your day?<eos> I helped catch a bad guy.<eos> You didn't shoot him, did you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Good.<eos> 'Cause I did not want to see you on the Internet. "Killer Cop."
Clean samples.<eos> No contamination, OK?<eos> - Nicky, if you'd like to take it from here?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Er, OK, guys, we're doing three dives today - each 20 minutes long, so we need to keep an eye on our bottom time, yeah?<eos> Dan will be staying on board, so that's me, Sam, Laura and Jonathan in the water...<eos> Dan, can I have a word?<eos> Not now, Jonathan.<eos> Please, I've got to know.<eos> And I've told you, I haven't made up my mind, OK?
Well, sir, you were right to make me get hold of an expert, because when I talked through the data with a professor from the oceanography department in Marseilles University, he was able to spot it at once.<eos> Spot...<eos> Spot what?<eos> Well, sir, last time, Mr Hagen and Dr Blake were getting readings from the reef - of temperature, salinity, carbon dioxide and so on - they were off the scale.<eos> Whereas this time...?<eos> All of the readings are back to normal.<eos> As my expert put it, either the data they used for their famous paper was contaminated... or, much worse, it was faked.<eos> I think it's time we spoke to Dr Sam Blake, don't you?<eos> What's up?<eos> You ever get a sixth sense someone's watching you?
There was this guy that I met at the student union.<eos> We got chatting. He knew all about my job - he said all I had to do was collect a package while I was out here and take it back to him in the UK and that he would... he would pay me £5,000 to do it.<eos> You're a drugs mule.<eos> Mr Hagen found out, didn't he?<eos> Yeah, he caught me red-handed.<eos> Dan said he had to report me to the police, and I...<eos> I begged him to wait, cos I'd be finished if he did.<eos> And he said he'd think about it.<eos> Please, I've got to know.<eos> And I've told you, I haven't made up my mind, OK?
And what are you doing here?<eos> Pam's my ride home.<eos> I can't even.<eos> And Archer, do you really need to do that right now?<eos> Yes, I do. Somebody left an entire palm print, Lana.<eos> Do you realize what skin oil can do to the factory finish?<eos> You realize how ridiculous you are, for buying that automobile?<eos> What?<eos> Shut up, it's amazing!<eos> So we'll just follow you in the van, and watch in amazement.
Um... Ours. As in mine and Archer's.<eos> Yeah I'm not the maid or the nanny.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Gosh, the times we live in, huh?<eos> So hey, private investigator.<eos> I might actually be able to use you.<eos> Oh, well... Really?<eos> Unfortunately, I don't think we're taking on new clients right now, so--<eos> May I speak with you a moment, please?
Well, good luck with no vagina!<eos> Ugh. Not you, Ms. Archer!<eos> Although...<eos> Wh- - She's obviously got a vagina.<eos> Yeah, probably why she's such a bitch.<eos> Jesus, really?<eos> A glass house? Probably so people driving by have to watch him bang his model wife on a mattress stuffed with doubloons.<eos> Not tomorrow, buddy.<eos> Then all they're gonna see is, well, I guess a bunch of cop cars, and whatever the coroner drives, probably a van...<eos> Oh and your wife's car, since she's-- she's the one who's gonna find you.
Nine, you-<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah. So, since you're the only person on the planet that I'd like to kill more than Ivy, and since I haven't yet, why did he hire me to do that?<eos> I don't know, he's crazy!<eos> And then maybe, in his paranoid mind, he thinks that for the past five years maybe I've been embezzling from the fund and also maybe sleeping with his wife?<eos> For five years?<eos> We maybe just had our anniversary.<eos> Hey, congratulations...<eos> Oh, thanks, man. On still being a massive dickhole.<eos> Okay, so I promised Ivy I'd kill you.
Well, how'd it go?<eos> Not great!<eos> - Well, how'd it go?<eos> - Not great.<eos> - Not you!<eos> - Not great, though.<eos> - Yeah, we kicked the shit out of him.<eos> - So embarrassing.<eos> So, pretty sure he honestly has no idea where Veronica Deane is.<eos> I hate to say it, but I believe you.
Is this mirror not working or...<eos> Don't be shitty. I'm in progress.<eos> And plus, Jerkleton, I've got this.<eos> Spanish Fly. - Right?<eos> - Pam, that shit doesn't work.<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> We just need to mix it with some mole's blood.<eos> So... hey, what were you saying about un-doubling the bet?<eos> Not a word.<eos> I'm serious, Ray. I'm about to punch you in the face with your own fists.
Why are you drinking champagne with him?<eos> And may I please have some of said champagne?<eos> In reverse order, no, I was mildly thirsty, and he wants to hire us.<eos> To do what, kill another scientist?<eos> And whose fault was that?<eos> - I don't remember. - Well...<eos> But whatever CIA bullshit you want us to do, Slater, the answer is no.<eos> Well, let's at least hear him out.<eos> - Are you literally insane?<eos> - No, but I'll tell you what is,
Yeah, good, keep him talking. I'm gonna sneak up on him from the side.<eos> The...<eos> Wait, what? to kill me...<eos> That was your plan?<eos> Well, you didn't even have one.<eos> Sometimes doing nothing is a plan!<eos> And... spoiler alert... nothing is what you should've done with Veronica Deane, instead of that pathetic little fanboy make-out session at the...<eos> For 's sake!<eos> What are we doing?<eos> Oh, I'll tell you what we're doing.
Shh-shh-shh-shh... Back to work, you... you goldbricks.<eos> All right, you heard the man.<eos> Let's go, let's go, let's go!<eos> That's exactly the sort of rumor I don't want you spreading around.<eos> Maybe this was just an accident.<eos> Nah, somebody definitely tampered with it.<eos> The brake line's cut, the steering wheel's tied off, and the throttle linkage is jammed wide open.<eos> Yeah, I was gonna say... linkage jam.<eos> Says the man who pays to have his Ferrari trucked around on a flatbed.<eos> And how much is that costing you?
Do you wanna play Top Speed?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I just wanna get my bearings a bit. Uh... okay.<eos> - See you around?<eos> Go along with whatever I say.<eos> - Sorry?<eos> - Whatever I say, go along with it.<eos> Okay, Wes, you're just pestering now.<eos> - Do I have to red light you?
You are.<eos> Jack and Coke times two.<eos> - Oh, no. Mine was just a Coke.<eos> - Times two.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I'm... regarding you.<eos> I feel like I'm being analysed.<eos> - Why the glasses? - Um...<eos> I like them.<eos> They totally work on you.
- I get it.<eos> - I have to go.<eos> - In this?<eos> It's been really great to meet you.<eos> Likewise.<eos> Shit.<eos> _<eos> - What the hell, Wes?<eos> - Look, I know I'm coming across...<eos> - I'm red lighting you, for real. Okay?
- You must be Kelly.<eos> - I guess I must.<eos> - She's waiting for you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Please.<eos> She won't be able to physically respond in any way.<eos> But she can hear you.<eos> I'll give you some privacy.<eos> Hello, stupid.<eos> It's good to see you.
Okay, look, look, I'm sorry, I just...<eos> I got this chance.<eos> We got this chance.<eos> I wanna share it with you.<eos> I said I made my choice.<eos> What is it? You feel bad because your husband isn't here?<eos> - Because that was his choice.<eos> - Don't. He chose not to stay here.<eos> It's like he left you.<eos> You know, he could have stayed, but he chose to leave you.
The other Thanes must speak their will and vote.<eos> Red for 'aye', black for 'no'.<eos> As Thane of Bregan,<eos> I vote for my sister, Rheda of Herot.<eos> Lagrathorn, Thane of the Banning.<eos> You made a good wife to Hrothgar, Rheda, but you're not the leader of men he was.<eos> The Banning vote no.<eos> Rate, Thane of the Varni.<eos> First, I bring a message from a dead Thane... my brother Scorann.<eos> If Beowulf is to serve you as Herot's Reeve, you have his vote.
You'll go to Mere, collect my son's bride.<eos> Bring her back safely.<eos> And take Elvina with you.<eos> What?<eos> - Why?<eos> - She knows their ways.<eos> - And?<eos> - And you will forget her now.<eos> I've seen you look at Elvina.<eos> And her at you.
- Should I...?<eos> - Look.<eos> Only their priests can enter.<eos> Hold.<eos> Two of us on one horse... even on foot... they'd catch up to us in an hour or two.<eos> Here. I know what will slow them down.<eos> This ends here.<eos> The Island of Dunes.<eos> Home of the Mere.<eos> Good to see you again, friend.
Why are you eating a chocolate cake for breakfast?<eos> - Have you no shame?<eos> - It's a muffin.<eos> You never had a muffin for breakfast?<eos> A muffin, let's see.<eos> Eggs, milk, flour, sugar, cocoa powder, chocolate.<eos> That sounds exactly like a cake, but of course, no civilized person would ever eat a chocolate cake for breakfast.<eos> You've lost your mind.<eos> Franklin, are you getting this?<eos> 'Cause I'm really talking to you.
Beowulf!<eos> Hrothgar's dead.<eos> Where's the smith?<eos> You're looking at her.<eos> You're a girl.<eos> With a big hammer.<eos> Think you can fix this with that big hammer of yours?<eos> If you pay upfront, I can.<eos> You don't think I'm good for it?<eos> Does being judged on your appearance trouble you?
Please!<eos> You'll become accustomed to it.<eos> May even come to enjoy it.<eos> Remember, before man came to the Shieldlands, the only living things here were the mud-born.<eos> Giants, trolls and the wolf-like barghest.<eos> All with black blood, all born from this land's dark dirt.<eos> Go on.<eos> I remember doing it but I don't remember why...<eos> Don't go seeking after glory.<eos> It'll find you.
Don't hold it so tight.<eos> Don't tell me what to do.<eos> Who do you think you are?<eos> You'll not pass.<eos> You're nothing, Beowulf.<eos> Your father was nothing.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Now!<eos> 'You're nothing, Beowulf.'<eos> I could kill you.
- Ah! My new daughter.<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> - Your mother and I --<eos> - What did you do to her?<eos> Married her, then shared her bed.<eos> Isn't that your custom?<eos> Stop!<eos> What were you thinking? !<eos> I wasn't.<eos> I had my way, they'd kill you with your friend.
And you.<eos> - Children?<eos> - Find me a proper game.<eos> If you want a proper game, don't use loaded knuckles.<eos> I'm a married man.<eos> I've got responsibilities now.<eos> Up.<eos> The healer said I have to rest.<eos> Up. I need the mind of a murderer.<eos> I told you - it was an accident.
Rate could challenge you.<eos> You'd have to defeat him in single combat.<eos> What was that?<eos> Bayen's body was here.<eos> Imagine you stabbed him.<eos> You make it sound like I'm an expert at this.<eos> Varni. Varr. They said you were licking boots here, but I didn't believe that.<eos> Even of you.<eos> Take me to the woman who claims to be Thane.<eos> Rheda will see you when she's ready.
I barely know her.<eos> You two seemed friendly enough.<eos> She's listed as...<eos> Donald Metcalf.<eos> I want an introduction.<eos> Tell her I'm a partner in Bishop Burcher, an accounting firm here in town.<eos> Make it work.<eos> Hi, it's Chelsea. Leave a message and I'll get back to you.<eos> Hey, Chelsea, it's Alex.<eos> I just was talking about you with a good friend mine, Simon Burcher, and he'd love to meet you.
It's good, it's amicable.<eos> We split up when they were kids, and we've... figured things out over the years.<eos> So how am I doing for a first-timer?<eos> Am I passing the test?<eos> There's no test, we're just seeing if we like each other.<eos> And?<eos> Well, what are you looking for?<eos> Just someone to spend some time with.<eos> I work a lot, so it can be difficult to meet people, given my schedule.<eos> I don't have a lot of free time, but of course... I'd make time to see you.
In dissection, it's very clear.<eos> The fungus is wrapped around your brain like ivy around an oak tree.<eos> But I can talk. I'm like you.<eos> You're not like anything that's ever existed before.<eos> You said you could make a vaccine.<eos> It's the whole focus of my research.<eos> Nothing matters more.<eos> I want to save people, Melanie.<eos> I want to save everybody.<eos> I tried to find some food for you, but... I didn't manage. But I did find something else.

But I did find something else.<eos> They're really great, aren't they?<eos> Now you can get out of those stinky things.<eos> They're very nice.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Tomorrow I'll try and find some food for you.
The woods are mine, too.<eos> It's peaceful.<eos> It's private.<eos> Thanks.<eos> New place is great.<eos> A work in progress.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I guess I needed some time.<eos> Yeah, I could have used some, too.<eos> I shouldn't have turned my back on you.
It's okay, son, I got this.<eos> Get him out of here.<eos> So, is this a social call?<eos> 'Cause my memory could be failing me, but I don't remember inviting you to visit.<eos> - You didn't.<eos> - Then you're trespassing on my land.<eos> - We had a deal.<eos> - You've been getting your cut.<eos> The deal was you wouldn't sell meth in Banshee.<eos> Do you have any idea what my uncle would do to you if he found out?
I'm going to wait for the right moment and then I'm going to fucking seize it.<eos> I'm going to remind the Brotherhood who the fuck we are.<eos> Sometimes I wonder if I'm the only one who sees how batshit crazy this world has become.<eos> - Please don't kill me.<eos> - Watts has lost his vision.<eos> Fuck Watts.<eos> He doesn't care that our families are in danger, that our future is on the brink, but I do.<eos> Fortune favors the bold.<eos> Power comes from being willing to do whatever it takes.<eos> Killing you would be much too easy.
I'm gonna clean you up a little bit more, okay?<eos> It's gonna sting.<eos> Do you have any idea... what you're even doing?<eos> You're still breathing, aren't you?<eos> You.<eos> You gonna invite us in?<eos> Colonel Stowe may have been crazy, but he was still military and kept meticulous records.<eos> After Genoa, CID seized his files.<eos> I tried everything I could to get my hands on them, but I kept hitting brick walls.<eos> So then she came back to you?
- Yeah, got him.<eos> - Jesus fucking Christ, come on.<eos> 17 MONTHS AGO<eos> - Hi, Kurt.<eos> - Maggie.<eos> - I... I heard you were back.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - I brought you some groceries.<eos> - Why?<eos> I don't see anyone else lining up to help you out.
Jesus. Fuck!<eos> Where's Job?<eos> What?<eos> Where's Job?<eos> - Where the fuck is Job?<eos> - I don't know who that is.<eos> Tell me another lie.<eos> Please.<eos> See how this works?<eos> Every time you bullshit us, she's gonna hit you.
I'm not talking about Job.<eos> You know, I spent nearly two years up in those hills blaming myself for everything that happened.<eos> Now, that would have been a big waste of time if this was all your fault.<eos> Everything got so fucked up.<eos> Yeah, it did.<eos> Mr. Fitzpatrick has had a change of heart.<eos> Really?<eos> You always travel with a handsaw?<eos> Tools of the trade, soldier boy.<eos> It would be best for you if you told them what you told us.
It's taco Tuesday.<eos> I'm sorry, Miriam.<eos> I can't legally do anything to make them release the body.<eos> Legally?<eos> Since when has legal ever stopped you?<eos> I'll personally bring Rebecca home to you as soon as I possibly can, I promise.<eos> When Rebecca left us, I prayed that she'd return.<eos> But when you took her in, I knew that God had forsaken my prayers.<eos> Her blood is on your hands, Kai.<eos> And for that, I will never forgive you.
- This was on Calvin's desk?<eos> - Yeah, why?<eos> These are very large quantities.<eos> This isn't just... local drug dealing.<eos> These numbers...<eos> I swear to you, this is almost over.<eos> But I need you to go home and pretend like everything's okay.<eos> Kurt, I-I-I can't do this much longer, okay?<eos> - I'm scared all the time.<eos> I will get you out of there.
You want to hook me up?<eos> I figure you owe me.<eos> Ain't you the fucked-up little delinquent?<eos> Hey, I'm just trying to play the shitty hand I was dealt.<eos> Girl, what you were dealt were two parents who would kill or die for you.<eos> That's a hell of a lot more than most people got.<eos> Deva.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Missed you, too, Mom.<eos> I'm just surprised to see you.
The fucking guy thinks the Devil works through him, all right?<eos> One night the freak comes in here, starts spouting off about how he's talking to Lucifer.<eos> I tell him he's full of shit. Guy takes the paring knife out of my hand, starts peeling back his fingernails one by one, smiling the whole time.<eos> Then he orders a drink.<eos> Who the fuck does that?<eos> Someone we should meet. See?<eos> When we're helping, we're happy.<eos> Yeah? Well, that's interesting.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, thanks. I'll call you back.
Where's my wife? !<eos> She's somewhere safe.<eos> She'll call you when she's ready.<eos> You are fucking with my family, Kurt.<eos> My wife, my son.<eos> Do you have any idea what I will fucking do to you for that?<eos> Where's Watts?<eos> Watts is dead.<eos> Where's Maggie?<eos> She doesn't want to see you.
After that, I never saw him again.<eos> It's a nice piece of property you have.<eos> Oh, thanks. My parents left it to me.<eos> Well, if you think of anything else, give me a call.<eos> - Thanks for your time. - Yeah.<eos> Hey, it's Veronica.<eos> You disappeared on me this morning.<eos> But, anyway, I tracked down our statutory rape victim.<eos> She said all the right things, but my bullshit meter is ringing.<eos> Anyway, I'm going back to the hotel, so call me and I'll fill you in on my... Oh, shit.
- They took everything.<eos> - Who did?<eos> I... I don't...<eos> You let Calvin Bunker take my drugs? Huh?<eos> You let Bunker take my drugs?<eos> Hey, it's Veronica.<eos> You disappeared on me this morning.<eos> But anyway, I tracked down our statutory rape victim.<eos> She said all the right things, but my bullshit meter is ringing.<eos> Anyway, I'm going back to the hotel, so call me and I can fill you in on the...
- Easy!<eos> - You, you!<eos> You're an FBI agent.<eos> And you're a serial killer.<eos> I don't kill them because I like to, you know.<eos> I know.<eos> - You kill them because you're insane.<eos> - It's all relative, right?<eos> Not really, no.<eos> You think Satan speaks to you.
It's open.<eos> - We having company?<eos> - Later.<eos> I'm not really dressed for it.<eos> And I could use a drink if you're pouring.<eos> - What would you like?<eos> - Whiskey, please.<eos> You're really gonna make me drink my last drink through a straw?<eos> We both know if I untie you, you'll try to run.<eos> Then I'll have to rough you up again to get you back on the table.
Mmm, what's going on?<eos> I don't know, yeah, you nasty little slut.<eos> Great.<eos> Well done, very nice.<eos> We're done here.<eos> Next.<eos> You look like a baseball player.<eos> Am I right? Huh?<eos> Blake?<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?
It is picture day, and I look like a Florida Panhandle meth addict!<eos> What are you surprised about?<eos> Of course I am mad.<eos> Look at what you did to me!<eos> I was gonna be the hottest teacher this year because Theresa Larson looks like a fat pig now that she's pregnant.<eos> Don't act surprised.<eos> Everyone is thinking it.<eos> I am just saying it.<eos> And now I look like my ass[BLEEP] Before I bleached it!<eos> Does it surprise you that I'm crying?
I'm gonna need access to the roof of that building.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Landry, I'm not finished with you!<eos> Look, look, this street gets cleaned out tomorrow morning.<eos> Not after I get an injunction.<eos> This street is a crime scene.<eos> Are you blaming these poor people for Joseph's murder?<eos> Doesn't his murder convince you how much these people hate what you're doing to them?<eos> Are you threatening me?<eos> I've been threatening you for six months.
When one checks into an establishment such as this, one expects the manager to be a Peeping Tom.<eos> But I do harbor suspicions that you saw something in that trashed room that greatly disturbed you.<eos> You mind telling me what that was?<eos> You're, uh... you're not gonna believe it.<eos> Try me.<eos> Yeah... Every day it's the same thing!<eos> Why?<eos> I hate you!<eos> I can't go on like this!<eos> I'm going insane having to look at you every day!
He talked to me.<eos> This is exactly how I saw it.<eos> Agent Mulder, please...<eos> He spoke to me.<eos> Shiraz. He spoke to me.<eos> What do you mean he spoke to you?<eos> Spoke to you when, Agent Mulder?<eos> With the help of Agent Einstein.<eos> Ugh, Agent Mulder, please stop.<eos> Mulder, when could he possibly have spoken to you?
Oh, not God, certainly.<eos> They won't know what hit them.<eos> That their fates were sealed since birth.<eos> They were simply puppets.<eos> You will die a lonely old man.<eos> Oh, I don't think so, Monica.<eos> Now that I have you to light my smokes.<eos> Why did you call me, Monica?<eos> To tell me what a coward you are?<eos> To tell you you're protected.
And Mulder...<eos> Where's Mulder?<eos> He loves Mulder.<eos> He sent a man to him to offer Mulder a deal.<eos> Who sent you?<eos> You sent for me.<eos> I'm here.<eos> This is so unnecessary, Fox.<eos> I don't come when you call.<eos> I've controlled you since before you knew I existed.
Yeah, yeah.<eos> I just... A paper cut.<eos> - There's a note.<eos> - You can read it. "Dear Susan, I've written a novel that will be published in the spring.<eos> "It's different from the kind of things that I was writing "when we were together."<eos> Go ahead.<eos> "In the end you left me with the inspiration that I needed "to write from the heart.<eos> "I wanted you to be the first to read it, so I'm sending along a proof.<eos> "I will be in LA until Wednesday on business<eos> "and it would be good to see you after so long.
- Mister, don't try no fucking shit with me.<eos> - What?<eos> You heard me.<eos> I know what you're doing. I know what your plan is.<eos> - What is the matter?<eos> - Don't try no fucking shit with me.<eos> No, what is the matter, man?<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?<eos> How do I know you ain't just gonna floor the gas and leave me in the dust?<eos> You get in your car and we'll get in ours and we'll follow you there.

No way.
What are you doing?<eos> - You'll get killed if you don't watch it. - Wait.<eos> Wait!<eos> No, wait.<eos> Wait, wait, wait!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> What did you fucking leave him out here for?<eos> Hey, mister!<eos> Your wife wants you!
Whose car were they in?<eos> I think it was mine.<eos> You think?<eos> What makes you think that?<eos> By the look of it and the sound of it.<eos> It sounded like my car.<eos> Could you see 'em in the dark?<eos> - Not very well.<eos> - Did they say anything?<eos> They said, "Mister, your wife wants you."
Mom?<eos> Is that you?<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> Yeah, yeah, it's fine.<eos> I just wanted to hear your voice.<eos> I miss you.<eos> You woke me up.<eos> I'm still in bed.<eos> It's Sunday morning, Mom.<eos> Can I call you later? Yeah.
- Okay.<eos> Edward?<eos> Edward?<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Susan.<eos> - Hi.<eos> God.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - It's good to see someone I know.<eos> - It's good to see you.
Why do you always think the worst of me?<eos> That is not what I meant.<eos> What I meant is that you are very strong-willed, and Edward, as sweet as he is, he's too weak for you.<eos> Weak is not a word that I would use to describe Edward.<eos> Sensitive is a word that I would use, which isn't a word I would use to describe anyone else in this family, except maybe Cooper.<eos> Don't bring Cooper into this.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Come on, Susan.<eos> I know you think that we don't care about the same things, but you're wrong.<eos> In a few years, all these bourgeois things, as you so like to call them, are gonna be very important to you, and Edward's not gonna be able to give them to you. He has no money.

I heard from this barman at this place, Line Camp Bar, that Ray lives here with a girl named Leila but he also keeps another spot to take girls she don't know about, probably your murder trailer before it got notorious.<eos> Does he look like he could be the guy?<eos> Yes, that's him.<eos> Good.<eos> Let's talk to him.<eos> - Hey, Ray.<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Get off my property, man.<eos> Shit, I'll call you back.
Give me some questions. I'll answer your questions.<eos> I don't know any more about this hold-up than I did before I met you.<eos> I tell you what, I'm gonna ask you a different question.<eos> - You recognize this car?<eos> - What car?<eos> This one.<eos> The one we're driving around in.<eos> Why should I recognize this fucking car?<eos> It ain't familiar to you?<eos> It don't remind you of nothing, take you back?
I mean, you're gonna work at a book store and just write a novel, like that's what you wanna do with your life?<eos> I mean, that's really romantic, but, like, what?<eos> This is it?<eos> - This is it?<eos> This is what...<eos> - You sound like your mother.<eos> Well, you always said that I reminded you so much of her, so...<eos> You know, this is exactly why I don't wanna read your work because you always get so fucking defensive.<eos> Yeah, of course I'm defensive!<eos> Do you know what it feels like to put yourself out on the line creatively and then have someone you love tell you that they don't understand it?
You might never get it again.<eos> I can't do this with you anymore, Edward.<eos> I just can't keep doing this.<eos> Susan...<eos> You can't just walk away from things all the time.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> Come on.<eos> I told you, I don't know nothin' about this situation.
Uh... What do you think?<eos> Control, Alt, Delete?<eos> Is that... what do you guys think?<eos> It's okay. - We're done? - Yeah... yeah, yeah.<eos> [somber music] I'm sorry, Josh,<eos> I just don't think video game design is for you.<eos> I... it... but it has to be for me, man.<eos> I got noth... like, this... this is my dream.<eos> Sometimes dreams are just dreams.<eos> Borlon, will I see you at the cool party this weekend?
Let me see.<eos> Ubbe.<eos> Hvitserk.<eos> Sigurd.<eos> Ivar.<eos> Ivar!<eos> You are all so big.<eos> Queen Aslaug.<eos> I have carved these runes for you.<eos> They will help to heal you.
He slayed the dragon Fafnir and is spoken of in the sagas.<eos> Surely you will inherit his warlike gifts.<eos> All of you will be great warriors.<eos> Even you, Ivar.<eos> Father!<eos> Sit. Come on.<eos> Please.<eos> Everyone, continue.<eos> Forget about poor little me.<eos> Everyone's so happy to see you, Ragnar.
I thought you should know about it.<eos> What kind of meeting?<eos> Some of the warriors are unhappy with what is happening.<eos> You're a Christian, a Frankish noble now.<eos> They don't want to fight for the Franks.<eos> How many?<eos> They don't want to fight against King Ragnar.<eos> I said how many of them?<eos> Maybe half.<eos> They want you to come back to the camp so they can talk to you.
They don't want to fight for the Franks.<eos> How many?<eos> They don't want to fight against King Ragnar.<eos> I said how many of them?<eos> Maybe half.<eos> They want you to come back to the camp so they can talk to you.<eos> What about you, Eirik?<eos> Are you also unhappy?<eos> No.<eos> That's why I came straight here to warn you.
Then you better leave soon, before the winter freeze.<eos> But I think you're making another foolish decision.<eos> Why are you really going?<eos> Because you don't think I can survive.<eos> Bar, stay close.<eos> Are you going to kill me?<eos> You betrayed me.<eos> You betrayed my trust and my love for you.<eos> I didn't betray you.<eos> I tried to save you from a false god.
Hello hello hello!<eos> Did you feel bad? !<eos> Why so touchy, baby?<eos> Just... Fought with my girlfriend.<eos> I fought with my boyfriend, too!<eos> Just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl!<eos> Filmy!<eos> Totally!<eos> Why'd you guys fight?<eos> If I tell you, you'll judge me...
I hate flowers.<eos> What did flowers ever do to you?<eos> Flowers are so overrated!<eos> Yeah, they look pretty... smell nice but colours fade and scent disappears and what you're left with is lifeless, wilted and diseased.<eos> Thorns, on the other hand...<eos> They're not so fragile...<eos> Thorns are fearless...<eos> I don't want to be just a flower...<eos> I want to be a thorn.<eos> I want to smack you!
I know how to take it off...<eos> Disgusting...<eos> 'Now, let's learn how to tie a simple saree...'<eos> 'Ensure your petticoat and blouse are matching...'<eos> Now, this is how to start draping a saree...<eos> Okay?<eos> Away<eos> Alizeh, if I go around you again... we'll have to get married!<eos> Just shut up.<eos> I'll slap you!
But... yeah I am.<eos> Don't feel weird...<eos> I don't love you or anything.<eos> No, no... I know that.<eos> You know, I'm really happy we're friends...<eos> I feel that sometimes lust just kills friendship...<eos> Love is passion but friendship is peace.<eos> And I never, ever want to lose the peace between us.<eos> Girlfriend, boyfriend, husband, wife... when those relationships die... the people just leave.<eos> And I never want to leave you, Ayan...
He was gone.<eos> I erased every trace of him...<eos> He can't come back, do you understand?<eos> Yeah, Captain...<eos> Terminal FBO 4, right?<eos> Okay... 45 minutes.<eos> Thank you so mum<eos> Alizeh...<eos> Alizeh!<eos> Sir, please! She doesn't want to talk to you!
Boyfriend...<eos> Back together<eos> Are you drunk? !<eos> You're the one who's drunk!<eos> You said you never wanted to see him again!<eos> I know, Ayan...<eos> But people in love are liars.<eos> This isn't love... it's weakness!<eos> Ali's my weakness...<eos> Alizeh, he's going to leave you.
What's up?<eos> Chatter is a fool's pursuit.<eos> Your eyes can't hide what your words conceal.<eos> Why we your tears?<eos> Don't imprison them...<eos> Let [hem be free<eos> rm very sad<eos> - That's me<eos> - That's me<eos> Listen, it was really amazing meeting you...
ls this supposed to be good?<eos> I don't get it...<eos> Didn't you say he was world famous?<eos> He is...<eos> People really admire his work...<eos> And you?<eos> '(owe awkward<eos> A We<eos> You can leave, if you like...<eos> And leave you alone with him?
Maybe you should be asking the person whose nights are now yours...<eos> People often falter on the slippery slopes of relationships...<eos> Yeah<eos> You could have shown me a better way...<eos> Let the one who is lost, find his own way...<eos> I hate you.<eos> A We no, a bl<eos> Such hatred... so soon?<eos> Give me a chance...<eos> Hating you is completely justified...
'Yeah...<eos> I'm happy.'<eos> 'Feels like I'm finally a part of Ali's life...'<eos> 'Our lives are wrapped in luggage...'<eos> 'And hotel rooms are home...'<eos> 'But it's nice.'<eos> 'There's the occasional dark cloud...'<eos> 'But other than that, the sun is always shining.'<eos> 'I'm really, really happy.'<eos> 'I hate you '
Beauty like yours often overshadows intelligence...<eos> Ask those of us who live off our personality...<eos> Beauty fades, Alizeh...<eos> But Death, himself, can't kill personality...<eos> Wow...<eos> So the poetry really was yours!<eos> I thought Ayan was just copying it off the internet!<eos> If it weren't for poetry I'd have died a thousand living deaths already...<eos> Cheese?<eos> Will I sound phony if I praise you some more?
I'll kill you.<eos> Now that you're here... I don't ever want to die.<eos> So, ma: Wm you have?<eos> Hi...<eos> Just some muesli with strawberries, please.<eos> - Muesli with strawberries... 7 And how about you?<eos> Same!<eos> - Okay!<eos> Oh, nothing... Just donated my hair online...<eos> May this bald head shower you with blessings...
I can do it.<eos> I'm talking to you.<eos> Yeah, run away<eos> Not like you have anything to say...<eos> AhZeh<eos> - I can break things, too!<eos> - That's a pressure cooker!<eos> Let M burst them<eos> What do you want me to do? !<eos> - Lie to you?
- I can break things, too!<eos> - That's a pressure cooker!<eos> Let M burst them<eos> What do you want me to do? !<eos> - Lie to you?<eos> - Yes, lie to me!<eos> - I can't lie!<eos> - Why not? !<eos> You're dying, anyway!<eos> Live or die, I will not lie to you!
I want to be destroyed.<eos> This thing we have between us...<eos> Our friendship... n: my greatest strength<eos> Love is my weakness...<eos> Why don't you understand that?<eos> Because a man and a woman cannot be just friends!<eos> Go...<eos> Get out of here...<eos> Go.<eos> I can't explain this to you anymore...
What's going on?<eos> Everything else is going, except for me who isn't going anywhere.<eos> How will he do?<eos> Papa, your heart will keep beating if he doesn't walk so he will have to do.<eos> Did you have to settle for him?<eos> Teddy!<eos> Teddy, stop.<eos> Papa...<eos> Gracy, this is the man I love.<eos> Your son-in-law will see you, and you will get a heart-attack.
When I play cards, I always play blind.<eos> I was born in the ICU.<eos> And my bank I use is ICICI.<eos> I swear on my mother... papa.<eos> Hold on.<eos> - Where did you find him?<eos> - Papa, we met on a blind date.<eos> Open your eyes, dear.<eos> Can't you see that he can't see?<eos> But papa, he's the reason I can now see you for the rest of my life. - - Who's he?
"Bloody love...<eos> From today love will be like a prayer."<eos> "Bloody love..."<eos> "Bloody love...<eos> From today love will be like a prayer."<eos> "Bloody love..."<eos> I'll have to test these three rats.<eos> "if you become my dear, like a small baby I'll take care of you."<eos> "When we're in love, then why did your father call the priest?"<eos> "I've just one thing to say to you, I swear..."
no-water fast.<eos> I don't drink on this day, and definitely not bathe.<eos> Just jump, papa's doing the countdown.<eos> To hell with the money.<eos> He's definitely a 100 percent blind!<eos> Maria!<eos> Get the vacuum!<eos> Suck the ants from my pants!<eos> - Bitten! - He 200 percent can't walk.<eos> For sure papa's going to test you as well.
You proved today that you really love me.<eos> And you know the best part about you is?<eos> Even though you live here, those Indian values and culture still exist in you.<eos> My phone, hold on a second.<eos> "I'll have to airlift the Indians living in Kuwait."<eos> "The Indians living in Kuwait... Indian."<eos> He needs so much attention.<eos> "London Bridge is falling down... falling down... falling down."<eos> "Come, let's get this party started, party started, party started."<eos> I'll call you back.
"One who harbors no enmity, is the happiest person on this earth..."<eos> A...<eos> T...<eos> M!<eos> Today I'm going to beat you.<eos> Urja.<eos> You're in London?<eos> When did you come out from jail, Urja?<eos> Seeing my good behavior, the government pardoned the rest of my sentence.<eos> After getting released from jail I thought of coming here and surprising you.
He informed me... that you're getting my daughters married to some guys who are not normal.<eos> What?<eos> What did I say?<eos> My daughters should never know what tears are.<eos> Didn't I say that?<eos> - ls that all you know?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I had chosen three capable and normal boys.<eos> That's why I called you to say there's a wedding at home.
Reflexes are normal.<eos> - What are you?<eos> - I am Kelex, your medical attendant.<eos> Where am I?<eos> Your confusion will abate as your temperature stabilizes.<eos> Would you care to dress?<eos> This was my mother's tunic.<eos> She used to wear it when she would put me to bed at night.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> I gave it to you.
And then he told you it was perfect.<eos> And that he loved it, and you, with all his heart.<eos> He made me feel so proud.<eos> And so happy.<eos> Like he always did. See?<eos> You do remember.<eos> But I also remember saying goodbye to you on that launch bay.<eos> And promising to take care of Clark...<eos> Kal-El.<eos> And hugging you so tight.
Or Adam.<eos> Of course not.<eos> I just don't know what came over me.<eos> Ker-rah, what is the most important thing I told you when I hired you?<eos> - No whole milk in the lattes?<eos> - No crying at work.<eos> Ever.<eos> Especially not big, fat crocodile tears.<eos> Do you really think that you can come into my office and manipulate me with this Catskills summer stock performance?<eos> But by all means, take the day off because I cannot stomach looking at you any longer.
I mean, he could be using our own technology against us.<eos> That's an interesting theory, Mr. Schott.<eos> Care to explore it with my team?<eos> Uh, no, I need to be there for Kara.<eos> The best thing you can do for Supergirl is keep the world turning until she gets back to defend it.<eos> - Uh, point me to a computer.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Kara was a natural in court today.<eos> Kal-El, you would've been so proud of your cousin.<eos> I noticed your mother and I were not the only ones who came to watch you today.
But I will not be dying today.<eos> Kara, get over here now.<eos> It's Astra.<eos> What happened?<eos> There was a fight.<eos> I killed her.<eos> I'm sorry, but I could see no other way.<eos> Kara, she doesn't have long.<eos> Hello, little one.<eos> I'm so happy to see your sister was able to bring you back.
- Well, that's what I meant.<eos> Oh, I mean, it's just been incredible, Adam.<eos> Beyond my wildest dreams.<eos> You know, I'm her mother, but she's my mother, you know?<eos> What?<eos> Lovey, how's my porridge coming?<eos> Uh, great, angel.<eos> Would you like hemp or agave syrup?<eos> Laird, no agave. Fuck agave.<eos> How many times do I have to tell you?
- You cannot grab people like that.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - I thought you were a murderer.<eos> Okay. No, no, no. We should talk about what happened.<eos> We most certainly should not talk about that.<eos> Yeah, we should.<eos> For our sobriety.<eos> We should pretend like it never happened and then maybe even never speak again.<eos> I don't want to do that.<eos> Well, who asked you what you want?
Yes, Nellie? Um, should we really be reading something about birth control?<eos> Like, honestly, this is basically a how-to guide to sex.<eos> Yeah, you're welcome.<eos> Yeah, that's inappropriate.<eos> Miss Horvath, there's an urgent call for you in Principal Toby's office.<eos> Urgent?<eos> Who is it?<eos> I couldn't make out the name, actually.<eos> He's... he's crying.<eos> Okay, Nellie, I'm gonna leave you in charge because you have a very authoritative presence, but I don't want you to use this time to continue to preach your agenda.
She's really cute.<eos> It's insane.<eos> She actually looks like a toy.<eos> You should consider putting her in catalogs.<eos> So this was fine.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> I'm gonna kiss you good-bye now.<eos> No. No, you're not.<eos> Because we are friends.<eos> Because you know as well as I do that even if we could be together, even if Hannah didn't exist, that I would destroy you.
I watch the news to him twice a day.<eos> Do you mind if I join you?<eos> Uh, I wouldn't think you needed to ask.<eos> Well, it's good to maintain the illusion of normalcy.<eos> Well, I gave up on that a long time ago, but for different reasons.<eos> - He's so great. - He is great.<eos> - You didn't know that?<eos> So, I'm gonna go... downtown.<eos> I'm going uptown.<eos> It was very nice to meet you.
Do you know what it said?<eos> - No.<eos> - It said this is the new world.<eos> And in this world, you can be whoever the fuck you want.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Maybe another time.<eos> Glass of sherry.<eos> The good stuff.<eos> Not that horse piss you strain through your old curtains.<eos> I've told you, never open your mouth that wide unless someone's paying you for it.
I think we have a problem.<eos> - Where? - Mariposa.<eos> Madam's listed as probationary, but her performance has continued to decline even further.<eos> Re-task Clementine for now.<eos> She's done the job before.<eos> And the old unit?<eos> Maybe leave her on the floor for the night, see if anyone wants one last turn.<eos> We recall her in the morning, decommission her.<eos> Shame.<eos> QA will fine you for this.
That's what I love about this place... all the secrets, all the little things I never noticed even after all these years.<eos> You know why this beats the real world, Lawrence?<eos> Real world is just chaos.<eos> It's an accident.<eos> But in here, every detail adds up to something.<eos> Even you, Lawrence.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> The maze.<eos> How do I find the entrance?<eos> I told you, I don't know anything about no fucking maze.
- Any idea how far this goes?<eos> - Who else might be involved?<eos> - Nope.<eos> He talks about it getting bigger from here, but I'm not even sniffing' it.<eos> Four months, it's all penny-ante bullshit, just rolling dealers and stealing doughnuts.<eos> You need to be patient.<eos> We chose you because Arceneaux owes you.<eos> You had the opportunity to hang him out to dry back at the Academy, and you didn't.<eos> I was just as guilty as he was.<eos> Which is why he trusts you now.
I was just as guilty as he was.<eos> Which is why he trusts you now.<eos> He doesn't trust me yet.<eos> Oh, but he wants to.<eos> It's whoever else is involved that's keeping you at arm's length.<eos> Well,<eos> I don't know if they're gonna let me get any closer.<eos> Look, IAD believes... and so do I... that your greatest deficit in this operation is also your greatest asset.<eos> That I'm your son.<eos> You prove yourself, and they will ask you in because you're my son.

Here's the other thing.<eos> Pretty sure I picked up a tail somewhere.<eos> - Pretty sure?<eos> - They're good.<eos> And I'm paranoid.<eos> Who?<eos> The Feds, I don't know.<eos> Check your car for bugs?<eos> Right.<eos> These days, they don't need a tail to track you.
Under the shirts.<eos> Pickup's every other week.<eos> What's this?<eos> We jacked a dealer. 3 G's.<eos> My cut.<eos> It's all in here.<eos> New players?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Every time I ask him about it, he gets a little hinky.<eos> They're still sniffing you out.
- I'll explain it to him.<eos> - Is there a problem here?<eos> Stay out of this, Harry.<eos> No problem, sir.<eos> This is between me and Mrs. Woo.<eos> Yeah, but I'm here now.<eos> I'd like to know what's going on.<eos> Harry, please.<eos> Let me at least call the gentleman personally and apologize.<eos> Let me talk to Mr. Woo, and I'll get back to you.

Of course.<eos> Of course.<eos> Hey, Rhodes.<eos> - Uh-uh.<eos> - Come on. One more?<eos> - One more?<eos> - I'm driving, brother.<eos> You ain't nowhere near .08, brother.<eos> I'm getting there fast, man.<eos> Hey, Julia, it was nice seeing you.
Day after tomorrow.<eos> You doin' okay with all of this?<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> I, um... I know it's been hard for you.<eos> To make your own way in the department, find yourself, get out from under my shadow.<eos> Uh, well, you know, I think I've got a really good shot of doing that with this gig.<eos> You know, if I could just get to the head of that snake.<eos> I'm confident you will.<eos> Well, thanks.<eos> This look like a North Vegas shit hole to you?
Let's hit it.<eos> Go!<eos> Whoa. Go!<eos> - Go, go, go.<eos> - Go on. Go!<eos> Shit!<eos> Goddammit.<eos> Marks.<eos> His people kidnapped my ex wife and daughter.<eos> Now he says he won't hurt them if I turn you over to him.
- Go, go, go.<eos> - Go on. Go!<eos> Shit!<eos> Goddammit.<eos> Marks.<eos> His people kidnapped my ex wife and daughter.<eos> Now he says he won't hurt them if I turn you over to him.<eos> Bullshit, you wouldn't do that.<eos> You got one play here.<eos> You give me something, anything that gets my family back, or I swear to God, I'll hand you over to Joey Marks in a heartbeat.
Clear!<eos> We're okay.<eos> We're okay.<eos> - Daddy.<eos> - It's okay, baby, it's okay.<eos> Whatcha doin', Harry?<eos> I'm calling Felton, have him come take out the trash.<eos> Okay, wait.<eos> Before you do that,<eos> - can I speak to you?
- Appreciate it.<eos> What are you so happy about?<eos> Why shouldn't I be?<eos> First degree murder indictment doesn't worry you?<eos> Man, I got an alibi.<eos> We heard different.<eos> I got no motive to kill Tony Allen.<eos> Joey Marks told you to.<eos> That was your motive.<eos> My lawyer's gonna shred that search warrant, and he's gonna shred you, Bosch, for planting that fucking gun.
As far as Joey Marks is concerned, you're dead, wherever you are, the streets or in the joint.<eos> - Unless you cooperate.<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> Rykoff, Luke.<eos> Extradition out of Vegas on a 1-87.<eos> Kiko, I want him put on keep-away status, 100 percent isolation.<eos> All right, when the sheriff's come to pick him up, make sure they know to put him in protective custody on a John Doe lodging.<eos> Harry.<eos> Not now, Mank, I gotta get home.<eos> Billets wants to see you immediately, as soon as his feet hit the premises, APB.
Your blood is not royal.<eos> A thousand stolen elections cannot change that.<eos> ...by the fangs of a black snake, let us not be bitten.<eos> And yet, my son will be Khan, and his son after him.<eos> Let us always trust one another.<eos> My bloodline is certain, and yours will end this night.<eos> I say this, not just as Mongols, but as people under the Mongol Empire!<eos> Open the gates to outsiders, secrets will spill!<eos> Brother.<eos> I should've left you there to bleed out in that cave.
And now let me welcome you into the fellowship of almost all of us.<eos> I betrayed my father for the Khan.<eos> And Kublai is ignorant... at best... when it comes to acknowledging the sacrifices of those in his service.<eos> But I am not.<eos> Go home.<eos> Home?<eos> You forget, my Empress, I cannot leave.<eos> - My Khan would not let me.<eos> - You cannot help who you are.<eos> He will hold you close until he realizes that who you are can only hurt him.

He does... or he doesn't.<eos> You wish to burn our salvation?<eos> I wish the lying and deceit to end.<eos> Which will not happen.<eos> If Kublai's reign of terror is allowed to continue, there'll be more lies and more deceit, until we drown in a melting pot of backbiting outsiders and malfeasance of all kinds.<eos> No good can come from so much pain and anguish.<eos> I made him do it, you know?<eos> What?<eos> Your father.<eos> I made him cut you out of her, cut you from your mother.

What?<eos> Your father.<eos> I made him cut you out of her, cut you from your mother.<eos> And your father never wanted you to know he killed her to save you.<eos> Will you be a good thing for him?<eos> Or was all that pain and anguish for nothing?<eos> The future of the House of Ögödei, of our family... is yours.<eos> Burn it... or don't.<eos> It's entirely up to you.<eos> Do you expect the army to defend you when faced with their Khan's return?
I can do it differently, can't I?<eos> Tomorrow, the Khanate is yours.<eos> You can do it any way you please.<eos> Drink with me.<eos> You were prepared to destroy me... right from the start.<eos> Poison from the Goyo plant.<eos> We have to go.<eos> We have to go right now.<eos> You may want to hold on to that.<eos> I thought I'd never see you again.
Cover me too.<eos> Oh, you crazy old man.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Palmer.<eos> Seriously?<eos> It's Dr. Palmer.<eos> Get down!<eos> Aah! We need to merge!<eos> We go out for one lousy drink, and you guys somehow manage to pick a fight with Boba Fett.<eos> Ah... - Aldus!<eos> - We'll get you out of here!
Chronos was clearly sent to bring me in.<eos> - You lied to us.<eos> - Of course I lied to you.<eos> I needed your help... you all barely said yes as it was.<eos> What about the legends part?<eos> Ooh, you lied about that too, didn't you?<eos> I chose you all because, a hundred years from now, your lives have minimal effect on the recorded timeline.<eos> I needed your help without disturbing the history of 2166.<eos> So, we're like the opposite of legends.<eos> Give me one good reason why we shouldn't kill you.
Where have you gone, for god's sake?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Or...<eos> Well, you've been gone.<eos> Have I missed that there is a curfew or something?<eos> You said he was disoriented.<eos> Mom sacrificed her entire life for you. So, the only thing she wants now is that you listen to her.<eos> We'll get through this, Jan.<eos> But the medication is not enough, some discipline will be needed, too.<eos> Because if it gets worse, she would have to put you in a home.
The nurse put your pyjamas in the wardrobe, right?<eos> The documentation is in the office.<eos> Here are lecithin bars, they are good for your memory.<eos> So that's done.<eos> Thanks.<eos> And why didn't you just get a normal divorce?<eos> A divorce? She wouldn't survive that.<eos> So having a husband in a mental institution is better for her?<eos> Yeah, happens in the best of families.<eos> We'll see how much good it will do you here.
- Go, cows.<eos> Freedom has arrived!<eos> Come, girls!<eos> Uncle will take you for a trip!<eos> This is freedom!<eos> What, you're afraid again, aren't you?<eos> As always. Even the cows, when they can, they go.<eos> See that?<eos> For thirty years, you've just been sitting and looking around.<eos> Women didn't take any freedom from you; you've never had any inside you.
Reliable mainly means a strict schedule and a properly locked door, especially at the closed unit.<eos> But I am not in the closed unit.<eos> Of course. But a patient committing criminal activities in a state of diminished capacity definitely belongs in the closed unit.<eos> I understand.<eos> And if you think we will make some sort of a deal later, you are wrong.<eos> Do you believe me?<eos> So this is what I get for all I've done for you?<eos> Great. Wanna get pregnant?<eos> Alright.<eos> I could have found somebody for you.
Yeah, mom.<eos> But he's an adult.<eos> And he has the right to live his own life.<eos> And when did you come up with that, honey?<eos> Before Erik ran away? 0r after?<eos> I'll call you.<eos> Yes.<eos> But it's just an old shed. A pile of rubbish.<eos> What?<eos> What use will it be to you, my dear girl?
Last spring, I knelt, as I do now, and altered both of our lives forever.<eos> And ever since then, I'm sure you've been wondering when I was gonna make this part official.<eos> Nicholas Miller, will you do me the honor of being my best man?<eos> I'm glad you're up.<eos> I've got something important to ask you.
Winnie the Bish!<eos> The Bish with the wish!<eos> And my wish is to have fun!<eos> Which is exactly why I'm not gonna confiscate the fireworks behind your back.<eos> Yeah, you got me, Officer Bishop.<eos> You can have it.<eos> I also want you to have this Jesus wig.<eos> - You know, wigs aren't illegal.<eos> - I know.<eos> But I think it would look awesome on you.
Me.<eos> I got Cece's mom.<eos> I was even on time.<eos> Oh, she's there.<eos> Put her on.<eos> Really?<eos> You can speak with her?<eos> How?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> No, Jess, I-I need to talk to you now.
Now, who's gonna take me to the john?<eos> - Not it!<eos> - Really?<eos> - You're the only girl here.<eos> - I can't.<eos> It hurts my back.<eos> Who keeps giving her juice?<eos> You're in a senility scooter; use a diaper!<eos> ♪ And it took a long time ♪<eos> ♪ To find you ♪
But why?<eos> Because you need a lot of practising.<eos> You are not good enough.<eos> I will pay special attention and I will tell you when you're ready to sing.<eos> Zsofi? We will not tell this to the others.<eos> You don't want them to think that you are not at their level, do you?<eos> Not.<eos> Get your candy.<eos> Your shoes are awesome.<eos> She praised you?
- What's going on?<eos> He's definitely in there.<eos> He ain't opening' the door.<eos> - You hopped up?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> Harrold?<eos> Harrold! Hey, buddy, I wanna talk to you!
- Tomorrow? No, honey. - Yeah.<eos> One's watch the marathon, the other one's run the marathon, and the third one is get down to Fenway and yell for those Red Sox.<eos> - Yellin' for the Red Sox. - Sox.<eos> - Sox.<eos> - Mmm. Red "Sahx."<eos> - Red "Sahx."<eos> - Red "Sahx."<eos> - I think you just wanna stay in bed with me all day.<eos> - Wanna know what I think? - Mmm.<eos> I think the reason Mrs. Flanagan wanted you to have it was because she knew you would hold him when he gave it to you.
- Love you!<eos> - Hey, Tiesha.<eos> - Morning, Sergeant Jeff.<eos> - How's your day today?<eos> - It is a muffin day, sweetheart.<eos> - We got blueberry. - Oh.<eos> You're an angel.<eos> - I try to be, just for you.<eos> - How's school goin'?<eos> The boys leaving' you alone, letting' you study?
Are we feeding that other video or no time to?<eos> Nobody in the VIP section at all. Unless they have credentials, period, all right? Nobody.<eos> Hey, Tommy!<eos> - What's up? - I got a favor. It's actually a gift.<eos> I'm gonna give you the finishing' line.<eos> - Come on!<eos> - No, no, no. This is your welcome back, Tommy.<eos> Means no more fuck-ups.<eos> Just smile in front of all the VIPs and let 'em all remember what a great fuckin' guy<eos> - I understand that. - Can I just talk to you for a second? - No, no, no, no.
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.<eos> You're not hurt, are ya?<eos> I'm fine, Tommy.<eos> My mother's here.<eos> - Everybody's here.<eos> - Oh, thank God!<eos> The news is going crazy. They're sayin' there could be more bombs.<eos> - Please be careful, Tommy.<eos> - I will. I gotta go, all right?<eos> I'm gonna call you as soon as I can. I love you.
I love you, too.<eos> What are those guys doin' here?<eos> They weren't even down there! What the fuck is this, a joke?<eos> They're the FBI and they're in charge, Tommy, so just do as you're told.<eos> And their boss, I wouldn't wanna be that guy. He's triple-fucked.<eos> One, he steps up and takes it. - Two, now he's gotta solve the thing.<eos> - What's three?<eos> He's gotta walk around inside that life all day long. - Fuckin' shoot me four times and...<eos> - Button it up, Tommy.<eos> These young guys are lookin' up to you.

He had an assistant manager tag and, um... he helped, we moved her.<eos> We... we laid her down.<eos> Blood just started to spread, his knee was in her blood...<eos> And then there was an eight-year-old boy.<eos> He was just layin' there.<eos> They had to take his family away, and his parents, and fuck, he's fuckin'...<eos> I got these images in my head. They ain't gain' away.<eos> And you were right there.<eos> Please don't be mad at me that I told you to come down there.<eos> I shouldn't have told you to come down there.
I'm sorry that I told you to come.<eos> I'm sorry that I put you there.<eos> We gotta find these motherfuckers, Carol. We gotta get out there and find these motherfuckers before they do this to somebody else.<eos> Back it up three seconds.<eos> Boss!<eos> This guy.<eos> White hat.<eos> Play it again.<eos> He's the only one that looks away.<eos> Feds wanna talk to you. Rick.
This is not my fault! Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> This is your fault!<eos> You were up front with him!<eos> I was in the back the whole time, and I went to get snacks, you piece of shit.<eos> Don't fucking accuse me!<eos> Don't fucking accuse me!<eos> Fucking be quiet right now. Do you understand? - Dzhokhar...<eos> - Okay. Okay.<eos> - You be fucking quiet right now. - All right, all right.<eos> - Or I'll fucking kill you myself! - All right, all right.
Now, I'd seen my Spock image used commercially before, such as on a box of Kellogg's Corn Flakes.<eos> I'd been amused by it, finding it campy and even flattering.<eos> Once "Star Trek" was canceled,<eos> Paramount had no legal right to license my likeness from that time on.<eos> So not only had Paramount been marketing me as Spock for almost 10 years without the right to do so, for the last five of those 10, they hadn't sent me any of the proceeds.<eos> I wound up having to file a lawsuit.<eos> They wanted to make this movie.<eos> And Bob Weiss had it in his contract that they would make their best efforts to get me in the movie.<eos> And my agent would call me and say,<eos> "They wanna talk to you about the 'Star Trek' movie." And I would say...
_<eos> _ _<eos> I want to arrange a trip for Elizabeth to see her mother one last time.<eos> I wish it were possible, but we both know that it isn't.<eos> The FBI found the bug.<eos> Martha knows about me.<eos> I saw you today staring into your coffee mug for a minute, straight.<eos> I can't take it.<eos> They're not gonna let up until they find the person that put that pen there.<eos> I-I am working on it, and I would do anything to protect you.
Gene Craft is dead.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What-- what happened?<eos> He'll be found in his apartment.<eos> It-it'll look like he killed himself.<eos> I don't-- I don't understand.<eos> The recorder will be found in his apartment.<eos> The recorder?<eos> My recorder?<eos> It was the only way to protect you.
What have you done?<eos> What have I done?<eos> It's my fault.<eos> I killed him.<eos> - No. - Oh, I did.<eos> It's the truth.<eos> Gene is dead because of me.<eos> It's not because of you, Martha.<eos> I did it.<eos> I said I would do anything I could to protect you, to keep you safe.
Why isn't he asking you for forgiveness?<eos> Did you ever talk to him about it?<eos> No. Why not?<eos> Because he moved away.<eos> He's not saying that, if you forgive yourself, that means that you think that beating a kid up is okay.<eos> He's just saying that spending the energy pushing it away is what, you know, is making you angry.<eos> It's not really anger, even.<eos> Then what is it?<eos> I just feel bad.<eos> You have a lot weighing you down, don't you?
Just dumb stuff.<eos> But you know how some of it makes you think<eos> "I wonder if this is why I act this way?<eos> Or why I'm so angry about that?"<eos> Thank you for telling me that.<eos> It's better.<eos> You'll see.<eos> What?<eos> What is it?<eos> I... I did wh-what I did... to take you out of danger.
Get it to Gabriel within 48 hours.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's Burkholderia mallei.<eos> Causes a disease called glanders.<eos> The inoculation we got was against a kind of meningitis.<eos> This is to meningitis what bubonic plague is to a runny nose.<eos> Gabriel and his friends at the Centre have been waiting my whole Goddamn life for this.<eos> Tell them I send it with love.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Hey, Philip, can I talk to you alone for a second?
All right?<eos> And she was there.<eos> We went out after.<eos> That's all.<eos> We've always been friends.<eos> Jesus!<eos> Stop!<eos> You don't think to tell me 'cause you went back to EST?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's weird, obviously, seeing you, seeing her.
My parents.<eos> A man named Dale.<eos> Maggie's father, Hershel.<eos> A woman named Andrea.<eos> A man named Tyreese.<eos> Who are they to you?<eos> My parents.<eos> Then they're still here... 'cause you're still here.<eos> When there's an opening, we'll make a break for that tower.<eos> No, I'll just slow you down.
You were right.<eos> So I'm here now.<eos> And I'm going out there and I'm helping you.<eos> We have to get her off that platform.<eos> She's hurt.<eos> She needs help getting over the wall.<eos> I can climb up the gate.<eos> You can distract them.<eos> We do it together.<eos> I'm just gonna follow you, anyway.
You were right.<eos> Let's get Maggie.<eos> Can't you just stay here?<eos> Nope.<eos> You've been given a gift, Denise.<eos> You'll see that one day.<eos> Or maybe you won't.<eos> The monsters will come, and you won't be able to run away when they come for you.<eos> The ones out there.<eos> And they will tear you apart and eat you up all while you're still alive.
- No!<eos> Go!<eos> Come on!<eos> Shit.<eos> - No, Glenn!<eos> - Go!<eos> Over here!<eos> Can you get the gate?<eos> Appreciate it, pal.<eos> Come on, we got you.
There's gotta be more.<eos> Everything Deanna was talking about... is possible.<eos> It's all possible.<eos> I see that now.<eos> When I was out there... with them... when it was over... when I knew we had this place again...<eos> I had this feeling.<eos> It took me a while to remember what it was... because I haven't felt it since before I woke up in that hospital bed.<eos> I want to show you the new world, Carl.<eos> I want to make it a reality for you.<eos> Please, Carl... let me show you.
He says the boy spent more time with Laura than Sarah, so Sarah seemed lonely and Sarah tried to speak in Thai, which Benz says was thoughtful.<eos> Tell him I appreciate the information.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Well, he's exhausted, but willing to talk.<eos> He seems embarrassed of the conditions he provides here, and he's not surprised that they left.<eos> They're not the first kids to go.<eos> And I spotted a Buddha, which means he believes in karma.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Agreed.<eos> He was making eye contact with you and didn't seem like he was acting suspicious or hiding anything.
Look, apologies if we've offended you.<eos> Every culture has their version of multiple violations.<eos> How do you know any of this after only one murder?<eos> Because he left a calling card.<eos> Yeah, in this case, he branded Jeff.<eos> What brand are you talking about?<eos> Mae was able to lift a partial image from Jeff's body.<eos> My analyst at home is trying to identify it.<eos> Hey. I've got it.<eos> I'm sending it to you now.
You're not.<eos> He was lonely and you connected to him, to the humanity in that moment.<eos> Feeling alone?<eos> It's a horrible thing.<eos> You're not alone.<eos> You have people who love you.<eos> I miss him.<eos> I miss him so much.<eos> Me too.<eos> So what are the chances that I would run into you just days before my 2-year bureau sabbatical runs out?
- They're really...<eos> - He cures lepers.<eos> - Oh, good.<eos> Good.<eos> - Oh, hi!<eos> - Whoa!<eos> You must be Josh!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, that's me, hi.<eos> It's so good to meet you, man.
That sounds fun.<eos> Thanks for organizing this!<eos> - Jesus, all right.<eos> - So sweet.<eos> Cool, thanks.<eos> Dude, I'm psyched Rosa's coming.<eos> Yeah, this is, uh... this will be good.<eos> Hey, you guys!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, Rosa, nice to see you again.
Thanks for organizing this!<eos> - Jesus, all right.<eos> - So sweet.<eos> Cool, thanks.<eos> Dude, I'm psyched Rosa's coming.<eos> Yeah, this is, uh... this will be good.<eos> Hey, you guys!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, Rosa, nice to see you again.<eos> It's nice to see you too.
Liz, meet my new girlfriend, Bosa.<eos> Bosa?<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Isn't she great?<eos> - Let's go get a drink.<eos> - Yeah, you got it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Stay put.<eos> Don't eat any garbage.<eos> Doesn't Bosa remind you of someone?
It's no biggie.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I just think it's kinda weird that I'm waiting around all night while some old guy is skeezing all over my girlfriend.<eos> How did you do that?<eos> I think I can answer that question.<eos> You see, my method was not about training at all.<eos> It was about spending time away from Mike with another dude, creating uncertainty.<eos> Right. I'm sorry I ever doubted your ways, Master Cheng.<eos> So, um...<eos> I should tell you, I've never exactly done the boyfriend thing before.
There is no... [buzzing continues]<eos> Okay, break room tips.<eos> If it's not yours...<eos> You okay?<eos> - Hmm? - Are you sure?<eos> Tell me what's up.<eos> I... I just think it's kinda messed up that you didn't respond to my texts yesterday.<eos> I love knowing that you're thinking about me.<eos> I love it, but I need you to understand that if I'm busy at work or with friends or something,<eos> I can't always get back to you right away.
Yes, of course...<eos> Ma'am, where do you want the cats?<eos> It the kitchen, in the food.<eos> Cats everywhere.<eos> Cats, cats, cats.<eos> - Oh, hey, babe. - Hey, I got your text.<eos> [cat squeals] Did you get a cat?<eos> Um, uh, sit down.<eos> So, uh, you texted me you wanted to talk?<eos> Uh, I just wanted to bring you here so I could talk to you about my journey, um, and that I've been feeling really crazy.
Or you wouldn't be standing here.<eos> Max was spotted.<eos> The cops... Get the kids.<eos> Need a lift?<eos> Fuck.<eos> Dammit, man...<eos> You OK?<eos> I know. That was fucking heavy.<eos> He's a goddamn loony!<eos> He bust out to see you.
Are you nervous?<eos> - No!<eos> It's only normal.<eos> I'm excited, I get a kick out of it.<eos> Great reason.<eos> Think the drug is immoral?<eos> You said it, not me.<eos> So what about you?<eos> What's your reason?<eos> I'm doing it to protect you.
I'm excited, I get a kick out of it.<eos> Great reason.<eos> Think the drug is immoral?<eos> You said it, not me.<eos> So what about you?<eos> What's your reason?<eos> I'm doing it to protect you.<eos> And I know I can't change your mind.<eos> I don't need protection.<eos> She's manipulating you.
You have no scruples? Nope.<eos> No scruples, no friends, no family.<eos> Nothing tying me down.<eos> And nothing to lose. Contrary to you.<eos> Might be good for you.<eos> I lack the patience.<eos> When I try to go straight, I get fucked.<eos> By my probation officer once.<eos> Been in prison?<eos> Does that shock you?
But it's just one day...<eos> you'll be fine without me.<eos> Now that Cece and Schmidt are engaged, she's here all the time, and her stuff is everywhere.<eos> Okay, yes, she's a hot slob.<eos> Ever since she got boobs, people stopped making her do stuff.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that is not an excuse.<eos> When I first grew boobs, people started handing me stuff, and I got messy, but then you got to grow up.<eos> - Not the same thing.<eos> - They're just boobs.<eos> I promise you, tonight when I get back from jury duty, I will explain it to her in a way that she'll listen to, unlike your way, where she'll rip your dingle off and sew it back on your head like a unicorn horn.
Guys, stop.<eos> Hey, Chaz, I'm on the other line.<eos> You're not gonna believe what happens to this glass.<eos> - It's an incredible story; you're gonna freak out.<eos> - Please stop.<eos> - I'll talk to you soon. - Put me on speaker.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Button's right there.<eos> I know which button it is.<eos> Now, what I'm about to say might shock you, but I need help getting out of jury duty.
He's probably just tired or hungry, or getting jealous that I'm spending so much time with his best friend.<eos> As a matter of fact, I am tired, and I am hungry, but the third thing is way off base.<eos> - If you weren't a girl,<eos> - Uh-huh?<eos> - I'd karate chop you in the mouth.<eos> - You would get winded just trying to ball your fist up, dough-boy.<eos> Well, good thing you don't need a fist for a karate chop,<eos> - you stupid idiot.<eos> - You are such a door knob.<eos> And if I wanted to karate chop you, you'd be dead!
What the fuck's he doing in Russia?<eos> He defected.<eos> He comes back in 1962.<eos> It's... it's complicated.<eos> Prove that you're from the future.<eos> Say something that's going to happen,<eos> - something I can check.<eos> - I can't...<eos> Fuck, I don't know, uh...<eos> What else can I tell you?
- Lee!<eos> Oh! - Ma, Ma!<eos> Oh, my darling, I did not think that I would ever see you again as long as I lived!<eos> I thought you were going to stay - in that God-forsaken country. - Course I wasn't.<eos> Oh, you look so...<eos> Ma, let me say hi to Bobby, please.<eos> You look so good!<eos> Oh, you say hello to your brother.<eos> How are you?<eos> Good to see you.
I did not call her that.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I told her to be careful how she dresses. I feel for Marina.<eos> I really do.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> That night... they went on and on and on and on about her dress.<eos> She dresses nice, you know?<eos> I mean, not like a nun, but nice.<eos> Lee's mother ought to be happy that her son's got such a nice-looking wife.<eos> I tell you, I...
- FBI!<eos> Hands up!<eos> - Where's our stuff?<eos> Shit! This is all useless now.<eos> We're going to have to start all over.<eos> - No way you jotos are FBI.<eos> - Yeah? You compromised a federal investigation!<eos> - None of this can be replaced.<eos> - Hey...<eos> Do you want me to fuck with you, huh, surveil you...
Calm down.<eos> - All right.<eos> Go on, get! You like the General, huh?<eos> You think that the General is a great guy?<eos> You think that that fascist has something to say?<eos> I have something to say!<eos> I have something to say!<eos> Wake up!<eos> Stay down! Wake up, you fucking fascist!<eos> Wake up, or I will kill you!
But if you're smart, you'll keep your distance.<eos> Don't let her seduce you.<eos> Sorry, I really do have to go.<eos> Just... Be careful with Avery.<eos> Okay?<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> - How are you? - How's it goin'?<eos> Good.<eos> Good to see you. It's good to see you.

So how's business school?<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Akers is out.<eos> Really?<eos> Barr confirmed it this morning.<eos> - Hey, Neil.<eos> - Come on in.<eos> I hear you're leaving.<eos> Who told you?
Yeah, that much I know.<eos> You look tired.<eos> You have a way of avoiding the point.<eos> I don't wanna bring you into this.<eos> You're late.<eos> I know, I- I had a doctor's appointment.<eos> Erase "sorry" from your vocabulary.<eos> Just be on time.<eos> What is it?<eos> There's something I want to talk to you about.
Work with us.<eos> Neil Akers is an excellent litigator, but moving your business to a new firm will cause a whole new series of setbacks.<eos> How much will it cost you to get them up to speed?<eos> Real sweet couple.<eos> Can't thank them enough.<eos> They own a chain of liquor stores and keep coming back to me to broker.<eos> And now with this hotel they want to buy, it would really put me... on the next level.<eos> And it would mean that you and I...<eos> What would it mean?<eos> I'm just so happy to see you!

I - I shouldn't...<eos> You can tell me.<eos> I'm not crazy.<eos> I know I don't know you well, but I feel like I do.<eos> Your eyes... are so honest.<eos> I know-I-I know that sounded like a-like a line but...<eos> I can't get you out of my head.

Can I call you back?
I told you on the phone, I'm under house arrest now.<eos> -I figured we'd just study here.<eos> -No.<eos> No way. Oh, come on.<eos> I can't have you failing this test.<eos> So just... bear with me.<eos> What'd I tell you?<eos> Ninja.<eos> You like that ice cream, huh?<eos> Smile looks good on you.
Contact the--<eos> No, it doesn't work like that.<eos> Now, uh, you're sure it was Will?<eos> Because Flo said you just heard some breathing.<eos> No.<eos> It was him.<eos> It was Will.<eos> And he was scared.<eos> And then something--<eos> It was probably just a prank call. It was somebody trying to scare you.
Do you understand?<eos> I won't tell her about you.<eos> I promise.<eos> Promise?<eos> It means something that you can't break.<eos> - Ever.<eos> Please?<eos> Pop!<eos> I just... I don't feel good.<eos> I woke up and my head, it really hurt bad, and my throat was all scratchy, and I wanted to tell you, but the last time I told you I was sick
Whoa, whoa. Careful, careful.<eos> I need you alive for the next few days, at least.<eos> Oh, hell, I could survive that.<eos> What?<eos> George Burness made the jump.<eos> And he was drunk as a skunk.<eos> He did it on a $10 bet.<eos> George is a liar.<eos> You make that jump from this height, that water turns into cement.<eos> Hits you like a ton of bricks. Break every damn bone in your body.
- Barbara, pull over.<eos> - What?<eos> Pull over!<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> His house is three blocks away.<eos> We can't park in the driveway.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Yeah, the neighbors might see.<eos> This is so stupid.<eos> I'm just gonna drop you off.
And I heard her.<eos> I didn't know what was real.<eos> And then I figured out that it was in my mind.<eos> And I had to pack all that away.<eos> Otherwise, I was gonna fall down a hole... that I couldn't get out of.<eos> No, you're... you're talking about grief.<eos> This is different.<eos> -I'm just saying that you--<eos> -No, I know what you're saying, Hop.<eos> I swear to you, I know what I saw.
Oh, thank God.<eos> Baby...<eos> --Mom... Mom, it's coming!<eos> Tell me where you are!<eos> How do I get to you? It's like home, but it's so dark...<eos> It's so dark and empty.<eos> And it's cold!<eos> Mom?<eos> Mom!<eos> Listen to me! I swear I'm gonna get to you, okay?
How do I get to you? It's like home, but it's so dark...<eos> It's so dark and empty.<eos> And it's cold!<eos> Mom?<eos> Mom!<eos> Listen to me! I swear I'm gonna get to you, okay?<eos> But right now, I need you to hide.<eos> Mom, please!<eos> - No, no, listen!<eos> Listen, I... I will find you, but you have to run now!
Just say...<eos> -Mom?<eos> -Jonathan!<eos> - Come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> - Mom, what is this?<eos> Come here. Come here.<eos> -What's going on? -It's Will.<eos> It's Will, he's... he's trying to talk to me.<eos> -He's trying to talk to you?
What?<eos> Oh, that.<eos> Uh... I just fell at recess.<eos> -Yeah? Friends tell the truth.<eos> I was tripped by this mouth breather, Troy, okay?<eos> Mouth breather?<eos> Yeah, you know... a dumb person.<eos> A knucklehead.<eos> Knucklehead?<eos> I don't know why I just didn't tell you.
Oh, good boy.<eos> Baby, I need to know...<eos> Are you alive?<eos> Are you safe?<eos> I need to know where to find you, honey.<eos> Where... where are you?<eos> Can you... can you tell me where you are?<eos> Can you...<eos> Please, baby.<eos> I need to find you.
Should be okay, I mean...<eos> I can't guarantee it, but it should be okay.<eos> What the hell is going on, Hopper?<eos> They bugged my place.<eos> -What?<eos> -They bugged my place.<eos> They put a microphone in the light.<eos> It's because I'm on to them and they know it.<eos> -I don't know...<eos> -Who? I thought they might be watching you, too.
-No, I actually don't.<eos> Just think about it, Mike.<eos> She could've just told us where the Upside Down was right away, but she didn't.<eos> She just made us run around like headless chickens. -All right, calm down!<eos> -No!<eos> She used us, all of us!<eos> She helped just enough so she could get what she wants.<eos> Food and a bed.<eos> -She's like a stray dog.<eos> -Screw you, Lucas!

Screw you, Mike.
-I told you everything that I saw. -Oh, gosh.<eos> Tell me again.<eos> -Upstairs or downstairs?<eos> -Upstairs.<eos> There was a laboratory.<eos> It was where they must do experiments or something, and then there was... There was this kid's room.<eos> -How do you know it was a kid's room?<eos> -More like a prison.<eos> So why would you think it was a kid's room, then?<eos> Because, I told you, the size of the bed, there was a drawing, there was a stuffed animal--
Don't be frightened.<eos> These are all friends.<eos> They're just here to watch.<eos> Don't focus on them.<eos> Stay in here, like before.<eos> Now, remember.<eos> Whatever it is, it can't hurt you.<eos> Not from here.<eos> So there's nothing to be frightened of.<eos> It's reaching out to you... 'cause it wants you.
Me, too.<eos> --Guys!<eos> It's Lucas, I think he's in trouble.<eos> Do you remember how he said he was looking for the gate?<eos> - Yeah. - What if he found it?<eos> What's he saying?<eos> I don't know, he's way out of range.<eos> ...son of a bitch!<eos> Lucas, if you can hear us, slow down.<eos> We can't understand you.
-I am afraid I cannot do that.<eos> -Take them off!<eos> -You heard her. Take 'em off.<eos> Chief, I get everyone's emotional here, but there's something you need to see.<eos> What is this?<eos> Why don't you ask your son? We found it in his car.<eos> -What?<eos> -Why are you going through my car?<eos> Is that really the question you should be asking right now?<eos> I wanna see you in my office.
You mean call her out for what she really is?<eos> Oh, that's funny, because I don't remember you asking me to stop.<eos> I should've put that spray paint right down your throat.<eos> - What the hell, Steve?<eos> - You know, neither of you ever cared about her.<eos> You never even liked her, because she's not miserable like you two.<eos> She actually cares about other people.<eos> The slut with a heart of gold.<eos> I told you to watch your mouth!<eos> Hey! I don't know what's gotten into you, man, -but you don't talk to her that way.
-Get out of my face.<eos> - Or what?<eos> Or what? You gonna fight me now, too? Huh?<eos> You gonna fight me now, too? Because you couldn't take Jonathan Byers... so I wouldn't recommend that.<eos> - Here, let me get the door for you, buddy.<eos> That's right.<eos> Run away, Stevie boy!<eos> Run away!<eos> Just like you always do.<eos> That Nancy's turning you into a little pussy!
-I need you to answer.<eos> It's like Lando Calrissian.<eos> Don't answer.<eos> We need to know that you're there, Mike.<eos> Listen, kid, this is the chief.<eos> If you're there, pick up.<eos> We know you're in trouble and we know about the girl.<eos> Why is she with the chief?<eos> How the hell does he know about...<eos> We can protect you, we can help you, but you gotta pick up.
Okay.<eos> Do you like Jonathan now?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> No, it's... it's not... it's not like that.<eos> Do you like Eleven?<eos> What?<eos> No. Ew.<eos> Gross.<eos> This will keep it dark for you.
- Get off me!<eos> - Ow! Let go!<eos> Eleven?<eos> Eleven, can you hear me? Eleven?<eos> Yes, yes, it's your papa.<eos> - Get off of me.<eos> - I'm here now.<eos> Let her go! Let her go, you bastard!<eos> Shh, shh, you're sick. You're sick, but I'm going to make you better.<eos> I'm going to take you back home, where I can make you well again.
El? El?<eos> - El!<eos> - Eleven!<eos> El, where are you?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> He's not breathing, he's not breathing.<eos> All right, Joyce, Joyce, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.<eos> - I need you to tilt his head back... - Okay. - ...and lift his chin.<eos> One, two, three, four.<eos> Now when I tell you, you're gonna pinch his nostrils, and breathe into his mouth...
Bring me a solo artist or a band that this label can market.<eos> I want new, fresh, fast, exciting.<eos> In two weeks?<eos> I mean, like, how can you put a time frame on talent?<eos> You're right, Mitch.<eos> You can go.<eos> What?<eos> Get out. You're fired.<eos> - Richie, I was just...<eos> Go back to Woodstock, you fucking freak, before I throw you down an elevator shaft! - Wait, Richie, I can...
Thank you.<eos> I promise you won't be sorry.<eos> There is one thing you can do for me.<eos> - He's out of control, man. - Let's go.<eos> Just move it, schmuck.<eos> Just go for a walk. - Let's go.<eos> - I'll fucking kill him.<eos> - What's up?<eos> Just keep smiling and looking at this album.<eos> There's something I need to tell you.
What are you doing here so late?<eos> Luke said he'd... drive me home if he was still here.<eos> Still doesn't trust those cabbies?<eos> Well, he's in the middle of an interview.<eos> Cool, I'll wait in the cafeteria.<eos> Hey... is there some sort of problem?<eos> Guy trouble?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Guy trouble, it's... something like that.<eos> I won't let them find you.
Yeah, we don't have the luxury right now, kid.<eos> Everyone back inside. Clary, who is this?<eos> Your meth dealer?<eos> I've seen him before.<eos> At the police station.<eos> He's a member of the Circle.<eos> Clary, he's here for you.<eos> He's with the people who took my mother.<eos> Right, your little best friend here led him right to you.<eos> He's here to capture or kill you.
Judge Clarence Thomas appears headed for confirmation to the Supreme Court.<eos> I think he'll be confirmed. I think he should be confirmed.<eos> We'll find it intellectually stimulating hearings, but I don't see many fireworks.<eos> Clarence, Ginni.<eos> First day of the hearings. How you feeling?<eos> - Good.<eos> Glad to finally be here. - Good. Good.<eos> Now just remember, some of these Democrats on the Committee are gonna be a hard sell.<eos> Worst case scenario, seven of them vote against you. That still leaves seven voting for you.<eos> And a tie takes you to the full Senate. We're in great shape.
Big Irish family.<eos> Five sibs.<eos> Close, though.<eos> Firemen, cops, nurses.<eos> Then, when I moved up here, this world, I saw how everyone looked at me.<eos> I never judged.<eos> Of course not.<eos> So I got my act together.<eos> And I'm comfortable in this life.<eos> But certain things you learn in inwood, they never leave you -- you know, like the idea that if someone has a problem with you and they come to you in person, you do what you can to take care of it.
Seattle?<eos> There was no Seattle back then, idiot.<eos> I bet I'll get it on the next guess.<eos> Bet you don't.<eos> How much?<eos> 10 push-ups.<eos> Deal.<eos> Border areas near the carolinas.<eos> You can't fall for that every time, Dean.<eos> See, he knows his customer, and he sets you up.
Must be.<eos> And we're $1,000 an hour.<eos> There's nothing there.<eos> Like Warren buffett says, you put a police car on anyone's tail for 500 Miles, he's gonna get a ticket.<eos> Hey.<eos> Come in.<eos> Bite?<eos> Oh, God, no.<eos> I'm glad you came in.<eos> I was gonna come see you.
Yeah. He's in the den.<eos> What the hell was that stunt?<eos> Skip wolkowska's an old friend.<eos> He asked for help.<eos> I didn't want to refuse.<eos> But I was 90% sure you'd react the way you did.<eos> It's a win any way you look at it.<eos> How is that a win?<eos> I knew that skip's lawyer would spread it, and it'd land in the news.<eos> And if you treat me that way, they'll all fear you.
A lot of people have axelrod's back in this city.<eos> He's made them a lot of money.<eos> And you know the line if you're gonna strike against the king.<eos> The king is house shopping right now.<eos> Prime beachfront, heritage.<eos> Hasn't even come on market yet.<eos> That's a mistake.<eos> A conspicuous buy like that in the news?<eos> He goes from a billionaire that you can pull for to just another rich asshole.<eos> If he turns the populous against him, he gives his edge to you.
I-I will.<eos> Uh, take care.<eos> Hall.<eos> I need to see you.<eos> This is cozy.<eos> It's secure.<eos> I checked with my sources in Washington.<eos> There's no case file against you, but Dan margolis was arrested.<eos> He was released on his lawyer's recognizance, and his arraignment's currently on hold.<eos> Which tells you what?
What do you got?<eos> There's movement.<eos> It's likely they've opened a case file on you.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm ready.<eos> They could be coming after you.<eos> Fuck 'em.<eos> You waited up.<eos> I made sure the kids were asleep.<eos> I wanted to see you.
You wouldn't know anything about it, would you?<eos> I think I had a dream about it once.<eos> Further word says they're rolling through people, rolling over them to get to the truth of the story.<eos> How'd it get to you?<eos> I make it my business to still know what's going on.<eos> I have three sons and six nephews in various branches, and we don't miss much.<eos> That's for sure.<eos> I'll say a more complete thank you at a later date, but... thank you for being a friend.<eos> Always.<eos> And slow down on these goddamn winding roads, Or next time it won't be the US Attorney that gets you.
I guess so.<eos> Very good, gentlemen. What are our next steps?<eos> Good morning.<eos> It is.<eos> - So?<eos> - "So"?<eos> That's what you have to say to me?<eos> Wait.<eos> I feel like I walked in halfway through the play.<eos> I decided I wasn't gonna say anything, but now, looking at you, sitting there, smiling in my face, fuck it.
Jesus Christ, you really are one of them now, aren't you?<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Are you really turning this on me?<eos> You betrayed my trust.<eos> After you were out all night.<eos> And don't give me this crap about how it was all business either, because I saw the two of you out there.<eos> Cozy as a couple of teenagers sharing a cigarette after a backseat fuck. Wow.<eos> You spied on me, too?<eos> No. I wasn't there to spy.<eos> Uh, it was to talk to you.
Even this, uh, the reason we're here right now having this conversation, he knew that I was acting on the bribery before anyone could've known it.<eos> He will not let me just walk away.<eos> He will not stop until he ruins me.<eos> Now you sound like a crazy person.<eos> He had me followed, all right?<eos> 'Cause he's trying to trip me up, he's trying to trap me.<eos> So I had to play dirty right back at him.<eos> Followed?<eos> Where?<eos> Trapped you how?
And like I said, he had someone on me and, uh... well, if I didn't get lucky, there would be pictures on the front page of today's Post.<eos> You went to see her without fucking tell me.<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> And I couldn't go through with anything anyway because, uh... Because you weren't there.<eos> How touching.<eos> I'm cut off.<eos> I'm cut off from you, from us.<eos> And you sit there and you try to claim moral high ground.<eos> I claim it? While you go on working at a criminal organization, and you can't even fucking admit it to yourself, Wendy.<eos> And you prop it up and you suck in all that it gives you... status, money, control.
What the fuck is going on?<eos> Looked like a winner, but it's not.<eos> 'Cause there is no gun.<eos> Uh, there will never be a gun.<eos> That's good legwork, Lonnie.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But I don't want you burning out your legs chasing another ghost.<eos> It's Chinatown, Jake.<eos> Been here a while?<eos> I didn't expect you back so soon after how you left.
You boys take it easy on me, alright?<eos> Before we make our final decision, we'd just like to hear from you, how you see our firm moving forward.<eos> Think of it as a... conversation.<eos> Right.<eos> Casual conversation across from five men staring at me.<eos> Look... You know me.<eos> I'm not an idealist.<eos> We need to move in directions which may not feel right.<eos> The market is changing at a rate that is exponential our current resources.<eos> I want to see you.
Into the long grass he goes.<eos> Hah!<eos> Ah, bad luck. That was very close.<eos> Sir?<eos> Minutes from the India Office.<eos> It was in their last dispatch.<eos> Do you know, don't worry, I'll get it myself.<eos> PHONE RINGS<eos> Whelan!<eos> You know I had a damn close shave taking this thing, My heart was going like a train, I tell you. Here.
I didn't think it mattered.<eos> Operators don't think. They follow orders.<eos> I'm going to need your weapons and then you need to report.<eos> - Report? - Mmm.<eos> I'm reporting now.<eos> I've known you a long time Condor.<eos> But I have to take you in.<eos> Is it a loyalty thing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> All I know is the Director wants to see you because you didn't follow orders and he wants to know why.
Love.<eos> A man's consciousness is malleable.<eos> It can be reshaped to fit our purposes.<eos> I can do this, I will do this.<eos> He will be your perfect weapon.<eos> Raise your hand.<eos> When I hold you, go ahead raise your hand.<eos> You see, when I raise your hand, you go up, when I raise it down, you go down.<eos> When I lift you up, you go up.<eos> All of these things are things that manipulate you, but they're not things that have to hurt you.

You planned this well.<eos> How can you be sure he's gonna go against the Director?<eos> That's what makes this part of the plan genius.<eos> Bringing you back to him will give him hope and love.<eos> And his love for you, even if he has never actually seen you in real life, it will make him hate the Director and the State for taking you away from him.<eos> - It's genius. - Would he care enough?<eos> I mean he's a killing machine.<eos> Is he even capable of loving another human being after everything you have done to him?<eos> The doctors are working on him as we speak, prepping him for the final stage of the plan.<eos> When he sees you, he will see his one true love.

She fits in!<eos> Where?<eos> By your side, I guess.<eos> You know, don't you?<eos> I can see it in your eyes.<eos> They've changed.<eos> There is no love left for me in them anymore.<eos> I had to do it.<eos> He made me.<eos> I mean, you've got to believe me that I never meant to hurt you, or betray you.

It really is.<eos> This is my destiny.<eos> Freedom.<eos> I think we just found our new symbol of hope.<eos> My brother.<eos> Mission complete, sir.<eos> Almost.<eos> You've done a wonderful job for me, brother.<eos> I'm really proud of you and really grateful to you.<eos> It breaks my heart to see you like this.
Pete: Come on, boys.<eos> Jim: Hold up.<eos> Hell of a random place for you to stop to water your mule, August.<eos> Last place for water till home.<eos> You seen any runaways around here?<eos> You know I wouldn't tell you if I had.<eos> I don't want any trouble.<eos> I'm just gonna be on my way.<eos> Yeah... Not before I take a look in your wagon.<eos> You want a hole in you, too, jim?
That y'all be sold or kilt.<eos> That your brothers would be worked and beat to the bone.<eos> And that you'd be too purty.<eos> There ain't no fear like that you have for your child.<eos> Make it so you can't see straight.<eos> You can't change what you saw last night.<eos> Focus on what's in front of you.<eos> Lose yourself in the work.<eos> (sizzling) Stand up.<eos> Tom: I put my trust in you, noah.
I know your brother.<eos> I don't think we ever spoke before.<eos> You don't leave the big house much.<eos> (gasping) I always wonder what it must be like up there, Sleeping in them nice comfy beds.<eos> We still slaves, don't matter where you sleep.<eos> This ain't that bad.<eos> Then hell, I guess I should put this to better use.<eos> Why is you's pretending?<eos> We all pretendin' in some way.<eos> It's nice to meet you properly,
They find your wagon, they know you ain't been to the ludlow's.<eos> Know you was on the wrong side of atlanta.<eos> It ain't my wagon, it's the massa's.<eos> It's been out there for days.<eos> All them bandits You really think there's anything left to find?<eos> You think you smart, huh?<eos> No, sir. "no, sir."<eos> Please, massa, please, I just a big ol' dumb nigger.<eos> Please don't punish me!<eos> You might've fooled them, but I see you.
Like this. I wasn't tryin' to run.<eos> I was just tryin' to get into the city.<eos> Find a connection to the freedom train.<eos> All right, I need you to tell me what this say. Now I know you crazy.<eos> Massa see you with somethin'<eos> I don't know who told you's I could read, But they's mistaken.<eos> I thought god ain't take kindly to telling' lies.<eos> I ain't gonna tell nobody.<eos> Now, this is the map to freedom.<eos> I'm trustin' you with it.
That'd be me, jim.<eos> Jim: You stole her right from under us. Constable:<eos> Y'all ain't the only ones tricked.<eos> He walked her right in here with his coat over her head.<eos> I swear I heard her call him a saint.<eos> That true?<eos> Not at all.<eos> She called me an angel.<eos> Hey, boy.<eos> Mr. Macon wants to see you up at the big house.
- I got it.<eos> - Mom, don't be so Western.<eos> All right. This is how human beings smell.<eos> ♪ ♪ Mom, I know it's only 9:00 a.m., but can we order pizza?<eos> Seriously, I've been having erotic dreams about pizza.<eos> Like, I'm about to kiss a boy and then his tongue just turns into a slice.<eos> Well, girl, you're back in the land of Seamless where you can order the pizza and the boy.<eos> Yes.<eos> Honey, will you sit down for a second?<eos> I want to share something with you.
- Okay, that was nice.<eos> - I know.<eos> I have never been this sexually in sync with someone before.<eos> It's like, you know exactly what buttons to press on my body without me ever having to tell you.
Okay, the point is, you totally disrespected her.<eos> Fine! I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I admit I was wrong.<eos> She's a total nutjob.<eos> Yeah, a nutjob whose book is gonna make some other publisher a ton of money.<eos> Nice work, Josh.<eos> How is this my fault?<eos> Charles,<eos> I am proud to say that I have successfully handled your... situation.<eos> And now the first thing that comes up when you Google yourself is the "Page Six" story about your wife leaving you.
There she is!<eos> Get down!<eos> Honey, there's our Uber.<eos> Oh, what the... ?<eos> - Hey, Jade.<eos> - Let me out of here!<eos> It's okay!<eos> Just chill.<eos> Here, have a drink.<eos> Josh has something he wants to say to you.
Shut up.<eos> That was you?<eos> There was so much pee.<eos> Yeah, well, you're lucky we stuck to plan number one.<eos> Okay, Jade, listen.<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> We will kick ass publishing your book.<eos> Well I'll give you one thing.<eos> I mean, you bitches are pretty desperate.<eos> Exactly, would Harper Collins ever kidnap you and make your ex-boyfriend apologize?
'Cause what happens at the Heller House stays at the Heller house.<eos> [whispers] Go away now.<eos> Just girls.<eos> I've ghosted people before.<eos> I think Miriam from the Jewish Museum is ghosting me.<eos> No, no, no, Mom, it's not just when someone doesn't return your call, okay?<eos> It's when they disappear into thin air, but they still haunt all of your social media feeds.<eos> I don't think that Josh is ghosting me.<eos> He just doesn't like coming to work stuff.<eos> Oh, cool, so he just doesn't support you.
I know.<eos> Pretty cool, huh?<eos> So cool.<eos> Did you happen to read the comment section yet?<eos> No, gah... pff, I never read the comments.<eos> Well, you might want to start.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Did you see the comments on the press release?<eos> I, like many people, do not read the comments.<eos> Let me read them for you.
Talk about desperate."<eos> "Who's Peters screwing now?"<eos> "Kelsey Peters, WT effing eff?"<eos> This is just a picture of a kitten in a Barbie car.<eos> Comments!<eos> I saw.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Once again, my timing could not be more perfect.<eos> Your dress is ready.<eos> This little custom creation will pick you right back up, girl.
I think you both did a great job tonight.<eos> Even the trash-to-table turned out surprisingly well.<eos> I enjoyed my offgrade sweet potato puffs.<eos> Yeah, who knew that restaurants just threw away pockmarked potatoes?<eos> That's like America throwing away<eos> Brad Pitt or Edward James Olmos.<eos> So where's your young man?<eos> Uh, I'm not sure there still is a young man.<eos> He's, uh... He's been ghosting me.<eos> Ghosting you?
Just what I need.<eos> - Who's that?<eos> - Brad Westlake.<eos> He's such a dick.<eos> We interned together.<eos> He was so far up everyone's ass, they called him "The Butt Plug." Now he's at Achilles, obviously.<eos> Kelsey Peters.<eos> Gorgeous as ever.<eos> Brad Westlake.<eos> It's good to see you.
- I...<eos> I want this.<eos> - You say that now, but who knows how you're gonna feel tomorrow.<eos> This is too special a connection to ruin with a one-night stand.<eos> - Let's roll the dice. - No... no!<eos> I'll call you tomorrow, and when I say that, I mean it.<eos> Get her home safe, okay?<eos> Not that she isn't perfectly capable of getting home without a man's help.<eos> So what are we drinking to?<eos> It was just so great to see you the other day.
Right now I'm only proposing a contained skirmish.<eos> But if you push me, I'll go North Korea on your ass.<eos> - Stop threatening me, Cheryl.<eos> - Oh, I'm done with threats.<eos> Hi, there.<eos> Cheryl Sussman for Dr. Wray.<eos> It's urgent.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> You win.<eos> The truth is gonna catch up with you every now and then.
This is my fault.<eos> Josh wanted to mention me in that story, and I asked him not to.<eos> I chose staying in the closet at work over going public about our relationship.<eos> Oh, Honey, don't turn this into a civil rights struggle.<eos> You're entitled to your privacy however you like.<eos> And he's entitled to break up with me over it, which he did.<eos> - So enjoy your pie. - Mm.<eos> Are you expecting someone?<eos> Oh, more young creatives.<eos> Liza, we're here to get you out of your misery.
He writes like a hipster Thoreau.<eos> - Who, the hot shepherd? - Yeah.<eos> Read this.<eos> Tell me what you think.<eos> Okay, but don't judge me.<eos> I mean, I don't know the difference between On Walden Pond or "On Golden Pond."<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Just read it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm telling you.
What does Kelsey think she's doing?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - She cannot marry Thad.<eos> Thad's the kind of guy that you get out of your system before you meet the right guy.<eos> Okay.<eos> I am so happy to hear this.<eos> I feel the exact same way.<eos> I don't think it's real.<eos> All she's done is post some vague picture of a ring.<eos> Liza, Kelsey totally respects you, okay, and even though, you know, you're just an assistant, you know, she really, really values what you have to say.
Record temperatures in the New York area as 100-degree weather hits its fifth consecutive day with no end in sight.<eos> I'll tell you who I want!
That night, her husband found out she wanted to leave him, and he followed her to the bus stop with a gut full of beer and a butcher knife in his hand.<eos> - You never told me that.<eos> - Well, I'm telling you now.<eos> Mr. Almeida walked out of his apartment with the intention to hack Mrs. Almeida into many bloody pieces... starting by taking off her head.<eos> Guess what?<eos> Never happened.<eos> Instead, he woke up in a hospital with two broken arms and a restraining order safety-pinned to his chest.<eos> Jesus, Matt.<eos> If I take a night off, people get hurt.<eos> I don't wanna lose you.
- Yeah.<eos> - All right, you might need additional...<eos> - Right, right, right.<eos> We also got forensics on the scene.<eos> Hey, I just need to know if my brother's in there.<eos> Step back, please.<eos> I'm sorry, sir, but I can't answer that right now.<eos> Hey, Brett!<eos> Over here, Matt.<eos> I would say it's good to see you, but under the circumstances...
Errands and a smoothie.<eos> Okay, everyone, listen up.<eos> Here are your new uniforms.<eos> Oh, you got to be kidding.<eos> - Aah. - Save your groans for Birdman!<eos> From now on, we will measure drinks.<eos> - Oh, man. - And we have a new one-napkin policy.<eos> - Just one napkin?<eos> - Questions at the end, please.<eos> Should somebody ask you for a second napkin, you just say, "Are you sure?"

Jess, what the hell are you doing?<eos> They're just the most amazing people I've ever met.<eos> What happened to the one-on-one with Fred?<eos> He's just so quiet...<eos> I can't get a read on him.<eos> Jess... if you want a comfy, old relationship, you got to start somewhere.<eos> Go spend five minutes alone with him, now.<eos> Go get some cheese for the wine.<eos> Chevre is always nice.<eos> But I wouldn't dare tell you how to buy cheese.
- Deeply.<eos> And that's why we want to make a deal with you.<eos> You and Fred equals you and us.<eos> Wow.<eos> Lo-Lovely home.<eos> Look, Javier, we've-we've come to give you an incredible opportunity:<eos> for you to apologize and get your job back.<eos> So, what do you say?<eos> Okay, uh, well, Javier, let me tell you something.<eos> Uh, I've been in the business world for just shy of half of two decades, and I can tell you that an opportunity like this does not come along often.
Yo, Nick, you like my shirt?<eos> It look like I'm naked.<eos> Very cool, man.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Come here, man.<eos> Hey!<eos> Get out of here. I'll catch up later.<eos> Boss man's got - to go over the books.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Good to have you back, man.
Don't listen to her.<eos> Then do it.<eos> Blow his head up.<eos> Blow my head up.<eos> Alright, fine.<eos> I made it up.<eos> How dare you!<eos> And you can start making your own bed, too.<eos> Wow.<eos> Thanks, Ramona. I'm so glad I only see you once a year.
Well, someday, I'll take you.<eos> Someday.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> You said someday.<eos> Not today or tomorrow or next week.<eos> Just someday.<eos> "Someday" sounds a lot like the thing people say when they actually mean "never."<eos> Let's not go someday, Teddy.<eos> Let's go now.<eos> Before I met you, Dolores, I was a different man.
Just someday.<eos> "Someday" sounds a lot like the thing people say when they actually mean "never."<eos> Let's not go someday, Teddy.<eos> Let's go now.<eos> Before I met you, Dolores, I was a different man.<eos> And I got some reckoning to do before I can deserve a woman like you.<eos> But I'm close.<eos> I'm close to making things right.<eos> And someday soon, we will have the life we've both been dreaming of.<eos> Now, I best get you home before your dad starts loading that shotgun.
We called it an accident, but I knew Arnold and he was very, very careful.<eos> Anyway, the update should prevent any further voices, but you will let me know if any of the hosts display or exhibit any unusual behavior, won't you, Bernard?<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> - Good. Oh, Bernard?<eos> Just don't forget... the hosts are not real.<eos> They're not conscious.<eos> You mustn't make Arnold's mistake.<eos> Why would I?<eos> Well, forgive me, but I know that the death of your son Charlie still weighs heavily on you.<eos> Yeah, sorry it took me a while to get back to you. You know how hard it is getting an open line out here.

You know how hard it is getting an open line out here.<eos> It used to annoy me... how difficult it was to reach you.
We found a stray up here, but I don't think it got here by accident.<eos> It's as if he got an idea in his head, one that we never programmed.<eos> What if he's like the others?<eos> Get back to me, Bernard.<eos> Bring yourself back online.<eos> I need your help, Dolores.<eos> I need to decide what to do with you.<eos> I think I made a mistake.<eos> I was just fascinated.<eos> I was being selfish, but I think it would be better if I restored you to the way you were before.
Sheriff stayed behind to fight them off.<eos> Are you going to ride back up into the hills to look for them?<eos> I'll send for the rangers.<eos> We'll go back up there in force as soon as they get here.<eos> But, miss, in truth, if there is a merciful god, those men are dead already.<eos> Father wouldn't let them roam this close... to dark.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Daddy!<eos> Oh, all alone after sundown.<eos> Who's gonna protect you now, hmm?
Don't suppose you have a light?<eos> No smoking in here.<eos> Normally, I'm sure, but this is the finest tobacco a man can enjoy.<eos> Hand-rolled on the ample thighs of exotic women.<eos> Perhaps you'd like to try one yourself.<eos> Choices, Lawrence.<eos> You know, you tell yourself you've been at the mercy of mine because it spares you consideration of your own.<eos> Because if you did consider your choices, you'd be confronted with a truth you could not comprehend... that no choice you ever made was your own.<eos> You have always been a prisoner.<eos> What if I told you I'm here to set you free?
Huh? Feed that to them.<eos> Slap leather, cocksuckers.<eos> Did I fucking tell you, or what?<eos> Upgrade.<eos> Nice.<eos> Ain't normally the type to complain, but this is just foolhardy. Two men taking on Wyatt.<eos> Keep talking, and I'm gonna take the horse back, Lawrence.<eos> Wyatt's freaks just wiped out the last group that went seeking him out.<eos> And here we are riding right after him.<eos> I'm just trying to convince you not to get yourself and me as a bystander killed.
I've known plenty of truly fucked up individuals in my time.<eos> Few that would hold a candle to you, sure.<eos> This one?<eos> Theodore Flood?<eos> He was Wyatt's friend.<eos> Those former associations are exactly why we need him.<eos> He's going to lead me straight to the big, bad wolf.<eos> I wouldn't count on that.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Didn't take you for the charitable type.
He's going to lead me straight to the big, bad wolf.<eos> I wouldn't count on that.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Didn't take you for the charitable type.<eos> You should've left him on that tree to die.<eos> You believe in fate, Lawrence?<eos> If the bitch exists, I'd like to kick her in the teeth about now.<eos> Don't be so glib. You'll hurt my feelings.<eos> As another old friend of mine likes to say, "There's a path for everyone."<eos> Your path leads you back to me.
Fuck.<eos> Isn't she from behavior?<eos> You think they found something?<eos> All right.<eos> Be cool, dickhead.<eos> - Okay. - No one's looking at us.<eos> Hi.<eos> You're Destin, right?<eos> That's correct.<eos> I almost didn't recognize you with your pants on.
No, Logan, enough's enough.<eos> I'm not doing this.<eos> You actually let loose for once.<eos> You shoot an unarmed man, and now you feel bad because you can't call yourself the hero. Don't you get it yet?<eos> There is no such thing as heroes or villains. It's just a giant... circle jerk.<eos> I think that philosophy says way more about you than it does about the world.<eos> And you... you see the world so clearly?<eos> You probably think you're on this trip because you're some kind of contender, some... some threat to me.<eos> I picked you precisely because you will never be a threat to anyone.<eos> My sister probably picked you for the same reason.
I was born.<eos> You were made.<eos> We feel the same.<eos> We are the same these days, for the most part.<eos> One big difference, though... the processing power in here is way beyond what we have.<eos> It's got one drawback, though.<eos> What's that?<eos> You're under our control.<eos> Well, their control.<eos> They can change you however they like, make you forget.
Pair what with me?<eos> You can improvise a little, but most of what you say was designed upstairs, same as the rest of you.<eos> This is just a cheap trick.<eos> I've run a brothel for 10 years, and if there's one thing I know, it's when I'm being fucked with!<eos> This can't possibly...<eos> I can't, can't.<eos> I can't...<eos> Maeve?<eos> You have a minute?<eos> Something I need to talk to you about.
Design.<eos> Can we please go back now?<eos> I don't want to get fired.<eos> And you'd get sent downstairs.<eos> Don't forget that.<eos> Welcome to Westworld.<eos> Live without limits.<eos> Maeve?<eos> _<eos> All right, let's get you back.
Some of her attributes have already been changed.<eos> - Paranoia, self-preservation.<eos> - Fuck!<eos> Someone's already been altering her in an unlogged session, someone with a fuck ton more privileges than us.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Don't know what it means for you, sweetheart, but I know what it means for me.<eos> I am done with this.<eos> So, you're done with your little side income?<eos> Probably your job, too.<eos> Seeing as you have ambitions in my line of work, let me tell you what I tell my new girls...
Good.<eos> Now, then, I see you had a blacklisted exchange with a guest in the course of your narrative.<eos> Can you tell me what happened?<eos> He said he wanted to cut off a piece of me to take home in his carry-on, that he wanted to mount it on the hood of his car for his friends to see.<eos> I told him if he wanted a trophy, I could cut pieces of him off and let him fish for them in the Olvido.<eos> And did this exchange make you question anything about your world?<eos> No.<eos> This world is as doomed as ever.<eos> And just for my peace of mind...<eos> Anything about these images that jumps out to you?
And if that person has the ability to snap his fingers and erase the value of that empire, you have to make sure you have a contingency.<eos> So, you and I need to ensure that by the time the rest of the board arrives, we are on course for that transition.<eos> Ilikeyou.<eos> Well, not personally, but I like you for this job, whichiswhyI'm gonna give you another chance to get a handle on this particular bitch of a situation.<eos> But the gods... they require a blood sacrifice.<eos> Weneedto demonstrate just how dangerous Ford's creations can be.<eos> No.<eos> No, nothing so obvious.<eos> We need someone thoroughly unexpected.<eos> I told you never open your mouth that wide unless someone's paying you for it.
ButI didit for you.<eos> Always doing things for other people, aren't you?<eos> Time to do one more thing.<eos> What?<eos> All my life, I've prided myself on being a survivor.<eos> But surviving is just another loop.<eos> I'm getting out of here.<eos> You two are going to help me.<eos> Do you know how far these people will go to protect their IP?<eos> Every part of this building, including the skin on your back, is made to keep you here.
Well, we are now living in a post-Rigby world.<eos> Man, this place is amazing. Yeah.<eos> We raised a shit ton of money.<eos> We're growing fast as balls. But we're not exactly super psyched with the quality of our engineering.<eos> Well, it's a good thing I'm here then, right?<eos> All joking aside, I actually have a few thoughts on your video platform if you...<eos> We're pretty happy with the basic platform.<eos> We want to hand you something way cooler.<eos> It's kind of like a secret project.<eos> I got to warn you, though.
Let's take a look at that contract.<eos> I would red-line it, but... I'm not allowed to have a pencil.<eos> This makes less sense the more I look at it. Okay.<eos> What's this number over here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I didn't handle the compression library.<eos> Neither did I.<eos> You're telling me Richard did this all on his own? Shit.<eos> I thought you did it.<eos> Now I respect you even less.
This morning, before the guests arrive?<eos> That way, it seems to me, there is no risk of detection. - No!<eos> Nareshtha, we have come so far together, you and I.<eos> Are we brothers or not?<eos> We cannot go forward now without trust! Hm?<eos> You have to tell me, for God's sake, where is it? !<eos> Where is the bomb?<eos> Sooni, it's done.<eos> He told me where the bomb is hidden.<eos> But what if he names you as his conspirator?
A royal milestone, indeed!<eos> Long live King George!<eos> Come on!<eos> Like we practised!<eos> Long live King George!<eos> Long live King George. Long live King George.<eos> Long live King George.<eos> English!<eos> Only English now for subjects of the Empire!<eos> I'll tell you what's wrong, child.
Where's Mr Raworth?<eos> He has gone away.<eos> And the baby, has it come?<eos> Yes, it is inevitable.<eos> Do you know what that means?<eos> Inevitable?<eos> It means there is no escape.<eos> Now the baby has come and he will be on his way and what will become of you?<eos> They will find me a home.<eos> Ha! No, I am sorry to tell you, my friend, but that man is lying.
Akshay.<eos> Is this what you want, Akshay?<eos> For Ravana to come and stick you with his sword?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> You want to find a home, yes?<eos> Are you a good boy?<eos> Run on the spot and show me.<eos> Keep going.<eos> Now listen.<eos> If you do exactly as I tell you, then I promise I will give you a home.
You tell me and I give you my word, I will save your life.<eos> Spit it out!<eos> Aafrin<eos> Dalal.<eos> - Sergeant! - Stop it!<eos> Stop it! Stop it!<eos> I don't know why you are making such a fuss.<eos> It was just a graze.<eos> A graze, she says.<eos> A graze that almost killed you.
- You can't just leave.<eos> - I have to!<eos> And I think you know why.<eos> You would do the same yourself.<eos> I don't have your courage.<eos> You think we are so different, you and I.<eos> But we are the same, Sooni.<eos> Peas in a pod.<eos> I have to follow my heart.<eos> I hate you so much.

Oh...<eos> I thought the coffee would fix that.<eos> You know, caffeine and weed. Poor man's speedball.<eos> What'd you say?<eos> Oh, speedball?<eos> I thought you said, "Poor man's Spaceballs."<eos> So I was like, fuckin'... a guy, like, with no money, like, made Spaceballs?<eos> Is that even conceivable?<eos> That a guy who had no money would make Spaceballs?<eos> Let's get you home.
"My life would be better without Gus," but... lucky you.<eos> You got your wish.<eos> You know what, fuck her.<eos> It's like, she never loved me.<eos> Our whole relationship was, like, fuckin' bullshit.<eos> Yeah, well, guess what? Most are.<eos> You know what?<eos> That's so true.<eos> And nobody ever tells you that.<eos> Nobody ever just pulls you aside and goes,
The NSA headquarters has 112 acres around the building, just for parking.<eos> That's like 85 football fields full of NSA employees' cars.<eos> The No Such Agency.<eos> Shit.<eos> Secret.<eos> You know, we don't even know what their budget is.<eos> But they get to know who we're having phone sex with, how we picking' our nose on the webcam--<eos> -Listen to me, listen to me.<eos> -What? I can't- - I cannot go through this again.<eos> Lolly, I swear to you, Aydin was not NSA.
She was scared to fly.<eos> -We stole her apple.<eos> -Vaguely.<eos> -Okay, I think that's her.<eos> -I guess?<eos> No, that's her.<eos> I remember her face, 'cause she fell asleep on me.<eos> Cool.<eos> Alex?<eos> I can't talk to you right now, Piper. I can't.
-What is it, Luschek?<eos> You might wanna come to the mail room.<eos> Yeah? And you might wanna suck my dick.<eos> Fucking incompetent.<eos> I'll deal with you later.<eos> I don't wanna suck his dick.<eos> This is really some kind of shit-show, huh?<eos> To be fair, you've come on a particularly crazy day.<eos> But also... yes.<eos> I'm taking you home.
Capudog!<eos> Where you goin'?<eos> Home.<eos> Shower.<eos> Sleep.<eos> Oh, sure.<eos> Now that you're the big boss man, you get to sleep all day while the rest of us have to work, huh?<eos> Pretty good life you got there, buddy.<eos> Healy, Healy...<eos> I had something I needed to say to you. I--
"dear god, please don't let this happen in the final."<eos> Not the way he would have liked to have done it, but he's in the final.<eos> Coming back to the warm-up area, I keep telling myself it's just one start, just the one bad start.<eos> You're ok.<eos> You ran back well. That's a positive.<eos> I tried to motivate myself by telling myself these things.<eos> And my coach came to me, he never really says much to me, but he called me over and says...<eos> What the hell is going on out there?<eos> You're trying too hard.<eos> You're making the pressure get to you.
I said, "oh, god." In that split second he just fly past.<eos> And here comes usain bolt, he's pulling away. 9.64!<eos> The champion becomes a legend.<eos> Why did we ever doubt the brilliance of usain bolt?<eos> Beijing was, you know, off the planet, but actually it was London, I think, that established him for all time.<eos> I don't think I can remember anybody since Muhammad Ali that has just grabbed the stage in any sport in the way usain has.<eos> So, on the day, 100 is for my coach, that's how we do it, 100 meters for my coach, the 200 is for me, so he didn't say absolutely nothing to me when it comes to the 200 meters.<eos> He was like, "go get 'em, champ."<eos> Came out. I know I had more energy because I had more confidence, so everything was smoother, I was happy.<eos> I remember doing some stride out and Warren Weir was in front of me, and I said to Warren, "I'm gonna run past you pretty fast."
You run your own race and you'll be fine."<eos> Everyone was like, "yo, are you ready? Feel like you're ready?"<eos> I'm, like, yo, I'm so ready for these finals.<eos> I remember coming off the corner. I looked.<eos> I could see him.<eos> I was, like, "usain, you cannot let Blake come off this corner before you."<eos> It was like I found another gear cos I started digging.<eos> When I got to the finish line, I remember Blake doing something at the national trials, he went like this after the race, and when I was going through the line, i went like this and I was looking at him.<eos> L was letting him know that, listen, I'm still number one.<eos> You're my teammate, and I respect you, but I'm the greatest.
Hi!<eos> Daddy!<eos> Hey!<eos> Look at you!<eos> Look at you!<eos> God!<eos> Sonya!<eos> Cheryl, I missed you.<eos> You look amazing!<eos> Politics agrees with you.
No, no, no.<eos> You two, you connect up.<eos> You haven't seen each other, I don't know when.<eos> I'll be back, okay?<eos> Love you both.<eos> Walter?<eos> Hi!<eos> Good.<eos> My goodness!<eos> It's so good to have you here.
I've missed you guys so much.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, Walter.<eos> All right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I have something for you.<eos> Okay.<eos> I do.<eos> Grace had it framed and she didn't have a chance to give it to you.
If you were more cultured, you would know that it says "Unbreakable" in Mandarin.<eos> Well, I actually took Mandarin for a semester in college,<eos> I'm pretty sure it says "sesame chicken."<eos> Stop looking at my ass.<eos> You know what?<eos> You're right.<eos> You got it.<eos> I think it says, "Free fortune cookie with delivery."<eos> Really?<eos> Let me try to get you out of here.
Just...<eos> Hold on.<eos> Back up off of my butt!<eos> No! No!<eos> No!<eos> There you go.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm good.<eos> What's wrong with you? I'm good.
Which tree do you think we should take home, Evan?<eos> This one?<eos> I want this one, Mommy.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Just like you.<eos> Feliz Navidad!<eos> What up, fam?<eos> Come on, Santa Claus!<eos> Time to go get them ho, ho, ho's.<eos> Good to see you, boy.
He's supporting Baxter.<eos> What?<eos> Our biggest donor just backed out?<eos> Politics.<eos> Yeah, so what do we do now?<eos> Well, the Brigham Group is still looking for a way to...<eos> Control our campaign.<eos> No.<eos> Yeah.<eos> To support you...
I heard you 1 O times already. Okay!<eos> Obviously you didn't.<eos> A bag of sugar.<eos> A bag of sugar.<eos> Two sticks of butter.<eos> Two sticks of butter.<eos> And some vanilla extract.<eos> Don't forget, Lonnie.<eos> And the vanilla wafers, and bananas...<eos> I'ma call you back.

Had to double up.<eos> How far do you usually run?<eos> A lot farther when people aren't talking to me.<eos> Me, I love the company.<eos> Helps the time go by.<eos> I don't.<eos> It distracts me.<eos> Girl, I swear, you haven't changed one bit.<eos> Except for this jogging thing.<eos> Looks good on you.
We have to pool...<eos> We have to cultivate resources.<eos> Pop. Hey, morning!<eos> Morning!<eos> Morning!<eos> I'm gonna whip up some pancakes here.<eos> You want some?<eos> No, I'm trying to lay off them processed carbs right now.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I cannot tell you how excited we were watching you on TV yesterday.
Hey, your mother...<eos> She would have turned this whole house into your campaign headquarters.<eos> Yep-<eos> She'd have been so proud of you.<eos> You know, maybe you can say a few words at the shelter this year.<eos> I mean, hearing from a future congressman would make the year even more special.<eos> I'd love to.<eos> Hey!<eos> Oh! Buddy.<eos> You ain't worried about me embarrassing you?
Look, I made a mistake in inviting you to dinner.<eos> And I'm really sorry.<eos> And I hope it doesn't totally screw up your whole day.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> There's maybe more sugar, butter.<eos> It looks like Grace's.<eos> Will it taste like it?<eos> Let's see.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Me and bunny were elected to tell you that everyone is really sorry.
Put a little muscle to it.<eos> Buff it out real good.<eos> I'm sure you got a pair of old underwear lying around, Walter.<eos> Little trick I learned over in Croatia.<eos> Listen.<eos> I'ma stab your ass with this fork.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> I would love that.<eos> Evan.<eos> What's going on with you?
She was always cheering the loudest.<eos> Every time I caught the ball.<eos> Every time I dropped the ball, she still was cheering the loudest.<eos> Every moment in my life, my mother was there for me.<eos> The one time...<eos> The one moment that she needed me, I was not there for her.<eos> Evan.<eos> You were exactly where she wanted you.<eos> Watching you do what you love is what she loved.<eos> I mean, she's still watching you and loving every minute of it.
But numbing the pain doesn't make it go away.<eos> Neither does selling the house.<eos> Without your mother,<eos> it's like...<eos> It's like learning to walk again.<eos> Though...<eos> I guess we're gonna both have to learn together.<eos> There they are.<eos> Managing directors of Brigham's.<eos> They just want to meet you before they leave town.
Cheers, ladies.<eos> This has been so much fun.<eos> Thank you, girls, for coming out with me.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> This has literally been the best day of my entire life.<eos> Oh, honey.<eos> My ex is picking up the kid, so I can go all night if...<eos> Oh, hey, did you hear that?<eos> My ex has my kid.<eos> Hey, hon, I've got a question for you.
Gosh, no, I made them by hand and then I put them in the weird plastic container.<eos> Oh, thank God. 'Cause we do not allow store-bought holes.<eos> Seriously, Vicky?<eos> Oh, come on, Gwendolyn.<eos> Who cares what food people bring as long as it raises money, right?<eos> Oh, did she just...<eos> Oh.<eos> Hit her with it, G.<eos> Well, you see, I care, sweetie.<eos> I don't... I don't know what's been going on with you, I mean, with your weird outbursts and your terrible style, but it ends now.
I just don't wanna be weird, okay?<eos> Baby, please don't cry.<eos> Please... No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Honey, I need you to look at me, just look at me, okay?<eos> Baby, baby...<eos> I need you to know that your dad loves you.<eos> That I love you.<eos> And I promise you, you will be fine.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because I'm your mom, and I know you better than anyone, and I know what you're made of.
What, hon?<eos> Carla, look, look, look, look!<eos> No, Kiki.<eos> No, Kiki!<eos> Kiki, no, no.<eos> Mike!<eos> Hey, babe!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I wanna get back together.<eos> I never should've left you.
I'm never going to college.<eos> I might as well just become a teacher.<eos> Baby, baby, look at me for one second.<eos> You'll be okay.<eos> I promise you I'm gonna handle this.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Just please don't make a scene.<eos> Honey, I would never embarrass you.
Yeah?<eos> That was by far the best I've ever had.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Oh, I was so worried.<eos> You know, it's been awhile since I've done this.<eos> I think I got pregnant.<eos> Oh, my God. Really.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi, yeah.<eos> Can I go down on you again?
How is that a problem?<eos> And she hasn't given me a blowie since my birthday five years ago!<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> Which is so not cool!<eos> Hold on one second!<eos> You want a blowie?<eos> Maybe if you cleaned the kitchen, made the kids dinner, cared for someone other than yourself, I would give you so many blowies your fuckin' dick would explode.<eos> My dick would never explode 'cause it's indestructible.<eos> Oh, my God, I can't deal with you!<eos> I can't fucking look at you.
This is about standing up to the bitch that hurt your little girl!<eos> Now, are you gonna sit here and let Gwendolyn get away with this shit?<eos> Don't do it, Amy.<eos> Fuck that!<eos> Fuck it!<eos> You are gonna rise up like a small, little white Apollo Creed and you are gonna look at Gwendolyn and you are gonna say,<eos> "You can do what you want to me, I don't care, "throw it at me,<eos> "but you fucked with my daughter,<eos> "and now I have to fight you.<eos> "I will fight you in the playground. "I will fight you in the cafeteria.

Sure, take a minute.<eos> Digest it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What, did you come to gloat?<eos> No.<eos> No, no, I'm just seeing if you're okay.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Okay. I don't wanna bother you.
Great day at school.<eos> Love you, Mom.<eos> I love you kiddos.<eos> Be great, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Be amazing. Be awesome.<eos> Love you!<eos> When did they get so big?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Hey, what would happen if I came over Friday night, brought a great bottle of wine, you know, made you a nice dinner, maybe ran you a hot bath and someone just took care of you...
Absolute pleasure. How are you?<eos> Did you bring the contract?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Okay, Gary, here's the short of it.<eos> I've been in this business longer than you've been alive.<eos> What I heard at Karen's bat mitzvah, that's the real thing.<eos> Gary Giombetta, you're gonna remember that... that cheese melon thing as the first meal you ate as an American Century artist.<eos> My album, would it open like a, you know...<eos> Like a gatefold, sure. Yeah.<eos> But first we're gonna develop you. Change your name, maybe.
- What do you mean? - She's ancient history.<eos> I tossed her like a fucking bowling ball.<eos> She had a horrible voice.<eos> What, are you fucking deaf?<eos> Hey, cops came to see me.<eos> Two dicks from the NYPD.<eos> - About Buck Rogers.<eos> - When was this?<eos> They know that the three of us were at the Oasis.<eos> They talk to you?
I saved your fucking life, now they think I did it.<eos> But you did. You killed him.<eos> You don't remember smashing his face in? - I had to pull you off his back.<eos> - I was defending myself.<eos> - Like a fucking enraged animal.<eos> - Are you out of your mind?<eos> - Oh, you don't fucking knock?<eos> - I did.<eos> I thought you said to come in.<eos> Use your head. That's all I'm gonna tell you, Richie.
Plus I'm throwing in some sweeteners to boost the sale. Grand Funk, Slade, Donny Osmond.<eos> "Alone Together" is still charting.<eos> It's a sweetener, all right?<eos> We're lucky to unload this shit.<eos> Okay, but that kid's one of the only things keeping us in cornflakes right now.<eos> Donny's not selling anymore.<eos> We got 10,000 copies of his record in mothballs, man.<eos> - He's old news.<eos> - What the fuck are you talking about?<eos> I pay you to fudge sales numbers so that they work in our favor.
Also '68,<eos> Quicksilver Messenger Service.<eos> Mm, Fillmore East. "Pride of Man."<eos> No fucking way!<eos> I could be lying.<eos> But if it happened in New York between '66 and '69...<eos> You know what?<eos> You are talented.<eos> But I'm assuming you know that already.<eos> I'm gonna have my editor credit you for the one of John and May.
I thought you liked him.<eos> Let's talk about that over tea, okay?<eos> Wow, this is really amazing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Seriously, you would never know that this used to be a nut house.<eos> Okay, we prefer the European definition of "sanitarium" when talking about this historic structure.<eos> Well, it looks beautiful.<eos> You did a really good job.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Didn't it sort of creep you out though?
Well, it looks beautiful.<eos> You did a really good job.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Didn't it sort of creep you out though?<eos> We evicted all the ghosts, Hanna.<eos> Soon people will forget what this place was and we'll just be remembered only for our exquisite brunch.<eos> My mother, the exorcist.<eos> I was hoping you'd bring Jordan with you.<eos> Yeah, uh, next time.<eos> I've been trying to get you back here to see the place since we opened.
Sorry, um... It's been a very wrong day and I didn't expect you to show up on my doorstep or anywhere else.<eos> Yeah, uh, Spencer told me about Charlotte and, um... I don't know.<eos> Maybe it was a conditioned reflex but... I thought I could help.<eos> Well, I'm glad to know that your reflexes still work.<eos> You okay?<eos> Well, we came here to help Ali and Charlotte killed herself.<eos> We could've just kept our mouths shut and she would still be in a nice, safe hospital.<eos> Instead, we have another funeral to get through.<eos> I thought I might stick around for that.<eos> Well, my mom can set you up with a room here, if you want.
Ali, there's nobody in the house but us.<eos> Hey, it's just another bad dream.<eos> He touched me.<eos> I felt it.<eos> No, Ali.<eos> Who are you talking about?<eos> Wilden.<eos> I'm gonna call Elliot.<eos> What's wrong with me?<eos> How are you gonna know that Sara's not following you?
Yeah.<eos> - Caleb.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I love you.<eos> Go.<eos> I'll call you later.<eos> Okay.<eos> I can't believe Emily left you alone.<eos> She won't be long, she just went to vote.<eos> If you have another dream, just tell yourself it's your mind playing tricks on you.
- No, I'm just... I'm Katee.<eos> - Yeah, Katee from Ojai.<eos> - Katee from Ojai.<eos> - Friend from Ojai.<eos> - Just met last night. Do you wanna hang out?<eos> We're gonna get into a cypher.<eos> - I should probably go.<eos> - Okay.<eos> But you have fun. Have fun.<eos> - I'll walk you to your car.
Like, you know, with six of us, we could just get a short campaign going of Mecha Dungeon Crawl.<eos> Mecca?<eos> Mecca Dungeon Cr...<eos> like, this is Islamic?<eos> - No, it's, like, mechanical.<eos> - It's a very complicated board game.<eos> We could just play through it quickly and with so many people, it would go pretty fast.<eos> I think that it's bad for me to play a game that's very complicated right now because I smoked tons of... ripped so much.<eos> I had a bong and I feel like it's not my preference to play a game.<eos> And I'm not gonna be able to get there with you.
Hey!<eos> - Cleaned up my nose.<eos> - How's it going?<eos> Here they are.<eos> - Thanks for coming.<eos> - Nice to see you.<eos> - Thanks for having us.<eos> - Yeah, man.<eos> - Good to see you.<eos> - Good to see you, too.
- Thanks for coming.<eos> - Nice to see you.<eos> - Thanks for having us.<eos> - Yeah, man.<eos> - Good to see you.<eos> - Good to see you, too.<eos> - Yeah, thanks.<eos> - What's up, dude?<eos> - What's up, man? - Fucking lumberjack?<eos> Nice to see you, man.
keep the breakfast train going?<eos> You know, I'm good. You know what, actually, my friends probably think I'm dead.<eos> Truly, they probably think I am like kidnapped and chopped up, - so I'm gonna go.<eos> - Okay.<eos> But, please, do your whole thing.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - Oh, yeah. Great to meet you. - Nice to meet you.<eos> - See you, Jodi. - ...guys.<eos> - Bye, Jodi.<eos> - Do you want me to drive you?
- Okay.<eos> But, please, do your whole thing.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - Oh, yeah. Great to meet you. - Nice to meet you.<eos> - See you, Jodi. - ...guys.<eos> - Bye, Jodi.<eos> - Do you want me to drive you?<eos> No, I'm fine. I'm gonna walk it off. - It'd be good.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - I think I should drive you home.
- Jen.<eos> - Hi. - Hey, how's it going?<eos> - Hi, Adam.<eos> - Happy birthday.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - This is Jen and Ali.<eos> - Hi. - Hi.<eos> - Jen.<eos> Adam.<eos> - Can I talk to you for a second?
- No.<eos> - Yeah, it's... I should've...<eos> There's a million things I should... I should have...<eos> That's okay.<eos> It's... like, I get that...<eos> definitely, it is weird.<eos> And I'm, like, holding my face.<eos> But it's also, I get... you know...<eos> Like, I know you.<eos> Like, I know I've never met you, but I know you.
- You ready?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> - I'm gonna take off as well.<eos> - Sure, man. I'll see you. - Thanks for coming.<eos> - Yeah, of course, buddy.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - See you.<eos> Take it easy, man.<eos> It was good to see you.
That was it.<eos> Or stay up here with me.<eos> It will be so much fun.<eos> We'll have mother-daughter slumber parties every night.<eos> Let's go check out that other bedroom.<eos> Jackson, perfect timing.<eos> I baked your favorite... chocolate cake.<eos> Mom, Mom, Mom, if this is another bribe about Kimmy and Ramona moving in, I'm cool.<eos> I can just go hide in my room. My boy cave.<eos> About your boy cave, there's something else I need to tell you.
Team D.J. on three.<eos> One, two...<eos> Well, hold on.<eos> Is it one, two, and then we say "Team D.J." on three?<eos> Or is it one, two, three, and then we say it?<eos> That would be going on four.<eos> Nobody goes on four.<eos> What am I, Canadian?<eos> I'm going to let Team D.J. work this out.<eos> I've been putting up with you for 25 years.
I'm fantastic!<eos> You boys know you're not supposed to be here.<eos> Jackson said you gave us permission.<eos> And now you lied?<eos> In my defense, how did you even know I was here?<eos> Dude, your mom's a vet.<eos> She must have dog-chipped you.<eos> I did not dog-chip him.<eos> I used mother's intuition.<eos> Which is the name of the app I used to track you.
I humbly accept the position.<eos> If that's how you all feel, I'll just step aside.<eos> But for the record, I am not stuck in the '90s.<eos> This is all '80s, baby.<eos> Look at you, doing the Gibbler gallop!<eos> Yeah!<eos> And sparkle, and sparkle!<eos> And gallop, and gallop and smack, smack.<eos> There you are!<eos> Hi! Grandma and Grandpa Fuller are so excited to babysit you.
Hi, Ramona.<eos> What's up?<eos> I'm fake-texting, so I don't look like a loser.<eos> Here comes this girl I kinda like.<eos> You should say hi to her.<eos> You know, I thought that went really well.<eos> She barely acknowledged us.<eos> I wanna hang out with my real friends at my real school.<eos> I gotta get out of here.<eos> I can make that happen. I'll bust you right out of here.
Ah, nice!<eos> Now we're talking!<eos> You can have 16 through 44.<eos> Mom, you can't be serious?<eos> I'm serious.<eos> I love you, but you need rules and lemons and boundaries.<eos> Not "lemons," limits.<eos> Oh! That makes more sense.<eos> Thanks, D.J.<eos> Don't blame D.J. It was my decision to punish you.
I've got two seats on some dude's private jet.<eos> He's the guy that invented the emoji that looks like this...<eos> No way!<eos> I use... this all the time.<eos> And I would love to, but I can't.<eos> It's Mommy and Me Face-Painting Day.<eos> You wanna come?<eos> Okay.<eos> Um, this is a cult, isn't it?<eos> If they're holding you here against your will, blink three times.
Let me just take that.<eos> Joke's on her.<eos> I had my feet in that ice.<eos> Yeah, I have to get to the pet clinic.<eos> I have Max's recital and now I have Tommy.<eos> Kimmy, can you watch the baby?<eos> I've got a meeting, but Ramona can watch him.<eos> Yeah, I'd love to help out.<eos> Tommy's adorable.<eos> Oh! Well, I wanna pay you.
And you are on fleek.<eos> I hope it's still fleek to say "fleek."<eos> When have we looked this hot and gotten along this great?<eos> Never.<eos> - We better get proof. Selfie.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Okay. Ready?<eos> No, tilt 'til we're skinny.<eos> Great.<eos> I'll tag you on Instagram, but first I have to unblock you.
I don't know if I should be tugging this thing down or pulling it up.<eos> Looking fierce, She-Wolf Pack!<eos> What did we talk about?<eos> We only howl in private.<eos> Do you have reservations?<eos> Yes, I feel like I should be at home with my kids.<eos> They're with me.<eos> Kimmy Gibbler in the club!<eos> Right this way!<eos> Wow! They really treat you like royalty here.
Do you want the chicken or the fish?<eos> We still haven't found the secret admirer.<eos> Hey, now.<eos> I see you got my roses.<eos> - These are from you? - Yeah.<eos> You'd think I would have got a thank you call or a text or thumbs up emoji or something.<eos> Honey, they're beautiful.<eos> I love them.<eos> But what are they for?<eos> As a thank you for getting to wake up next to you every morning and fall in love with you all over again.
Fernando, get up.<eos> I gotta get you out without anyone seeing you.
I gotta get you out without anyone seeing you.<eos> Why?<eos> We are still technically married.<eos> We fell asleep watching a movie.<eos> What's more married than that?<eos> Let's just tell the world we're back together.<eos> We are not back together.<eos> We are secretly contemplating considering mulling over the possibility of maybe getting back together-ish.<eos> If that's how you feel, then, yes, we should keep this a secret from Ramona.<eos> How are we gonna sneak you out of here?
All eyes on me right now.<eos> I have a deep, dark secret that affects everyone in this room.<eos> The truth is I didn't shave my legs today!<eos> -What was that noise?<eos> -Whoa, whoa, whoa! Still confessing, hi.<eos> I also... didn't shave my legs yesterday.<eos> Glad I got that off my chest.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Get ready.<eos> Your dad's coming to pick you up.
You know what?<eos> Take her to the zoo.<eos> -Hey, everybody!<eos> Dad, you don't have to ring the doorbell.<eos> It is your house.<eos> I wasn't ringing it, I was, uh, cleaning it.<eos> Either way, thank you for not just barging into my home.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I hate people who do that.<eos> Dad, it's so great to see you again.
What about the pros?<eos> I kinda like him.<eos> That's a pretty big pro.<eos> Well, I think if it feels right, go for it.<eos> -Thanks, Dad.<eos> -Love you.<eos> Do you think we could've had a talk like that on a couch covered in new upholstery?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Hey, pal.<eos> I've got a bone to pick with you.
I paid a guy to steal my car.<eos> Well, I guess the universe wants you to walk home.<eos> Wow. This is the biggest tip Gibbler Style has ever gotten.<eos> Turns out you did a great job.<eos> Thank you, Stephanie.<eos> You're welcome, Kimmy.<eos> I used to think of you as D.J.'s annoying little sister.<eos> But you're actually a talented, creative, beautiful young woman.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> And I used to think of you as a goofball.
From one All-Star to another, choke up on that bat.<eos> I'll leave the tickets at Will Call next time.<eos> I just came by to pick up my ticket.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Here you go, Matt.<eos> We will see you at the seats.<eos> Oh, sweet.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> I will see all of you guys there.<eos> Oh, I forgot, there's one more thing I need to talk to you about.
I saw that ear thing.<eos> You're that mystery blonde, ain't you?<eos> You're the jinx. Boo!<eos> Why are you booing me?<eos> I'm a Giant's fan.<eos> Hello.<eos> Aw, he struck out again.<eos> You'll get him next time, baby.<eos> Dump her, Hunter!<eos> She's killing you, buddy!
This San Francisco?<eos> Oh, I thought you'd be a little more excited than that.<eos> No, I am.<eos> It's wonderful.<eos> I just thought you were going to Steve.<eos> I mean, leave.<eos> But now you're going to Steve... stay.<eos> Now batting for the Giants, number eight, Hunter Pence.<eos> Hand me a foul ball. But not too hard.<eos> Max, honey, the odds of Hunter hitting a foul ball directly to you are like a billion to one.
Wow, you were right.<eos> This view is amazing.<eos> Yeah. My dad used to bring me up here.<eos> You can see the city. You can see the bay.<eos> I see my mom's car getting a parking ticket.<eos> I told her that wasn't a space.<eos> It's windy.<eos> - Are you cold?<eos> - A little.<eos> I'll keep you warm.
Ah, you got a tooth.<eos> We don't need a blender.<eos> Here.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Oh, you want mine now.<eos> It's 2:00 a.m. Why don't you tell me where you were, where you really, really were?<eos> We were at a dance recital.<eos> An all-male Australian dance recital.<eos> Come on.<eos> I can't wait to get you upstairs.
You need to get your butt over here tomorrow.<eos> You're going to be D.J.'s date for Kimmy's wedding.<eos> Okay?<eos> Alright.<eos> Go Team Matt!<eos> Be up in a minute.<eos> I need some... cheese.<eos> Not too much.<eos> We're sharing a bed.<eos> Sorry to wake you up.
I'm okay waiting.<eos> In the meantime, I'll see you every day at work.<eos> I'm still your podiatrist.<eos> Wait, you're not seeing another one, are you?<eos> No, my feet are all yours.<eos> I'll start with your feet and I'll work my way up to your heart.<eos> Wow, she picked herself.<eos> I did not see that coming.<eos> I don't know. I thought she was going to pick you.<eos> I thought she was going to pick you.
And here comes the bottle service.<eos> Take your time, Max.<eos> One wrong move and it's all over.<eos> Jengaaa...<eos> I know you're trying to mess with my head.<eos> And it's working.<eos> Easy, easy...<eos> Nobody move but you...<eos> J-Money, Jenga Master, wins again!<eos> I can't beat you at anything.

On a whole global scale Kevin<eos> He's taking over the world Kevin Hart<eos> Kevin!<eos> You're late.<eos> Better late than never.<eos> Do you have the package?<eos> Of course, I have the package, Kevin.<eos> Don't I always have the package?<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Which is why I'm asking you, "Do you have the package?"
Hart.<eos> The name is Kevin Hart.<eos> Or maybe it's Mr. Bond, huh?<eos> It's a little confusing.<eos> He's so little.<eos> What?<eos> What? What'd he say?<eos> Okay, Kevin. Kevin.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Don't let him get you off your game.

Everything about a raccoon says crime.<eos> My lady gets home, I said,<eos> "Babe, we gotta get the fuck out this house.<eos> "A raccoon came up to the glass doors,<eos> "put his hand on the glass, saw me, shot at me twice.<eos> "Bang, bang!<eos> "Then he grabs his dick, disappeared into the dark."<eos> My lady goes,<eos> "What do you get out of lying so much?<eos> "Like what does that do for you?"
You drive in, you drive out.<eos> What the fuck I need lights for?<eos> I was wrong, people.<eos> I need lights. Can't see shit in this goddamn driveway.<eos> You gotta understand, I don't like being in the dark, hearing animal noises, especially when I can't see the animal.<eos> It fucks with me.<eos> When you're by yourself and you get scared, you do stupid shit.<eos> When you hear this...<eos> You do stupid shit when you get scared.<eos> "You bite me, I'll bite you back, bitch!"
"No."<eos> "Get the fuck out of the car.<eos> Right now! Get out the car!<eos> "You wanna be a smartass?<eos> You're going to jail."<eos> "I'm not!<eos> I'm not! This is how it is.<eos> I'm stuck with this.<eos> "Don't do this, please."<eos> Cop have a tough time grabbing you out the car.
Let's say you and your man taking a walk.<eos> Beautiful day outside.<eos> You look at your man, you say,<eos> "Babe, I love you more today than I did yesterday."<eos> Out of nowhere, an orangutan hops the fence, attacks your man.<eos> The orangutan takes his kneecaps.<eos> He can never do this again in life.<eos> He is straight-legged for the rest of his life.<eos> You can deal with this right here?<eos> This ain't gonna fuck with you every day?

What happened?<eos> You can't convince a black woman of shit.<eos> "Hey, babe. Babe, don't walk over there.<eos> "It's real slippery right there."<eos> "Slippery?<eos> "Really?"<eos> She walk over there anyway, trips, falls, hits her head.<eos> "Oh, my God, it's slippery over here.<eos> "They need to put a sign up."<eos> "Bitch, I just told you, it was fucking slippery over there."
They got real long hair.<eos> So my son gets excited, he does this shit.<eos> Listen, listen to me.<eos> It makes me so mad.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> This shit makes me so fucking mad.<eos> The reason why is because his hair looks just like mine.<eos> It's just like mine.<eos> So I'm like, "What are you doing?"<eos> He was like, "I couldn't see you."
"Don't do that.<eos> "You see me.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> "Don't act like you can't see me."<eos> He was like, "I just wanna play." "Fine, go. Go play."<eos> My son goes in his room, he plays all day.<eos> All day.<eos> It's time for bed.<eos> I say, "Go in there, brush your teeth, wash your face, get into bed.<eos> "I'ma kiss you good night."
He opens 'em up.<eos> I had 57 handprints in all the boxes.<eos> He saw it, he starts crying.<eos> He was like, "What is this?"<eos> I said, "Those are high fives.<eos> "I got you high fives."<eos> He said, "But I didn't ask for these."<eos> I said, "Neither did I."<eos> You selfish son of a bitch.<eos> You better be lucky I didn't take a picture of my ass and put it in that box, tell you to kiss my fucking ass, that's what I should've did.
"Whose life?<eos> "You was gonna kill my son?"<eos> "Depending on what side he was on."<eos> What?<eos> My dad called me over the holidays.<eos> "Hey!<eos> "I miss you.<eos> "I miss you, I miss them babies.<eos> "I wanna come see y'all."<eos> I said, "Dad, all you gotta do is tell me when, I'll put you on a plane."
Connie gets in the house, she goes off.<eos> "Oh, my God!<eos> "I love it! I love it!<eos> "I wanna see the whole house!"<eos> She says, "Spoon, push me all over so I can see everything."<eos> My dad snapped. "No!<eos> "No!<eos> "Sick of this pushing shit!" That's what he said.<eos> "I've been pushing your ass all over the place all goddamn day.<eos> "Wherever I sit you is where you're gonna have to stay
"Oh, my God!<eos> "I love it! I love it!<eos> "I wanna see the whole house!"<eos> She says, "Spoon, push me all over so I can see everything."<eos> My dad snapped. "No!<eos> "No!<eos> "Sick of this pushing shit!" That's what he said.<eos> "I've been pushing your ass all over the place all goddamn day.<eos> "Wherever I sit you is where you're gonna have to stay<eos> "until I feel like moving you again."
I grabbed my robe, I start scared-walking towards the hallway.<eos> Scared-walking is when you're walking, but you're leaning backwards just in case...<eos> Just in case some shit goes down, you can get the fuck up out of there real quick.<eos> It's quick.<eos> I'm scared-walking.<eos> Scared-walking.<eos> I get to the hallway.<eos> As soon as I get to the hallway, I cut the lights on.<eos> I don't what it is, people act like lights can stop a murder. Like...<eos> Like a murderer will see lights and be like, "Man, I was about to stab you in the neck,
Thank you, Louis, yay!<eos> So, in the meantime, what I really need your help with is with hiring, is with the curriculum, and it's also... with, um... outreach.<eos> Sorry.<eos> We just need to send the message that this is a racially and economically diverse school.<eos> So, whatever you can do to... get the message out will be great.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What, I just... - Two co-workers talking.<eos> - No. - It's okay, all right? - It looks weird.<eos> It looks weird.<eos> I just wanna touch base with you. I need to talk to you.
(laughing) I'm so sorry.<eos> Tina, why don't we get you an Uber, and you can get your car tomorrow?<eos> I'm not taking an Uber, okay?<eos> I... This is my sister's house.<eos> - You guys take an Uber.<eos> - It's fine. You can just sleep on that couch and then Alex and I can take that couch, right?<eos> I'm not gonna sleep here - while you guys... - Whoa.<eos> He's already seen them.<eos> Not in that way.<eos> Tina, why don't you give me Larry's number, and we can call him, and he can come get you?
He's already seen them.<eos> Not in that way.<eos> Tina, why don't you give me Larry's number, and we can call him, and he can come get you?<eos> Larry is with Tom!<eos> How many times do I have to... spell it out for you?<eos> Well, she can't go to Larry's 'cause he's with Tom.<eos> - Remember?<eos> Tom Hanks? - Thank you.<eos> Come here.<eos> I want to talk to you, actually. Come here, I want to talk to you.
- Mm-hmm. - Secrets?<eos> No.<eos> We're not gonna have those.<eos> Like... there is nothing between us right now, and that's how I want to live.<eos> And I'm really fucking happy.<eos> Where'd you go?<eos> You just escaped to Mars for a second.<eos> - Sorry. - It's okay.<eos> I did.<eos> I do have something to tell you.

Bought them from his mother's estate.<eos> Each has an appraised value of $5,000.<eos> Later I realized Kevin had stolen one.<eos> Some people have no decency.<eos> Well, you are right about that.<eos> If you were to give me Kevin's address, we'd be happy to follow up.<eos> See if we can recover your stolen property.<eos> Outstanding.<eos> I'll get that for you.<eos> Hey, there. Sorry to bother you again.
- Actually I just might.<eos> If we can't get in, we'll just have to get Wayne to come out.<eos> Wayne!<eos> Who's there?<eos> It's me, Mindy.<eos> Mindy?<eos> Didn't expect that, did ya?<eos> What, what are you doing here?<eos> Don't be mad.<eos> I know you don't want me visiting you at work, but I have to tell you...
Maybe you do belong here.<eos> Oh, this is gonna be fun!<eos> Why is she making us watch her eat our chicken?<eos> What do you mean, "our chicken"?<eos> It was my egg first.<eos> It weren't. I had it first.<eos> - I found it!<eos> - This is why.<eos> This is why you're watching.<eos> Queenie, I need to talk to you about my title.
Again.<eos> Again.<eos> Stay with him.<eos> Slide your feet, anticipate.<eos> All right. We'll go again.<eos> Don't give up any ground.<eos> Don't let him get by you.<eos> It's good to see you, Taylor.
It's all right.<eos> No?<eos> Let me see.<eos> Stop.<eos> Just be fun.<eos> Come on.<eos> Stop it!<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> We just got here, okay?<eos> I'm not driving you back.
Keep it cool, kev.<eos> Keep it cool.<eos> Sub in. Sub in.<eos> Oh, you got to be kidding me.<eos> Foul trouble, babe.<eos> Look, you got four fouls, all right?<eos> He's fouling me -- all right.<eos> It's all right.<eos> It's all right.<eos> We'll get you right back in, all right?
You take the shot.<eos> I talked to Evy.<eos> I saw the pictures.<eos> Leave it.<eos> Those are online.<eos> Kids are just sending them around.<eos> Just leave it alone, please.<eos> They're there forever.<eos> Do you know -- you know -- unh-unh, no, no.<eos> Do you know... How hard it was to get you into that school?
Yeah, magical bird, when it dies, it immolates itself, and from the ashes another one arises.<eos> Right, so when you see that bird, it's the same bird, only it isn't.<eos> When did you get so damn cryptic?<eos> Oh, you want honesty.<eos> I'm proud of you, Agent Mills.<eos> I'm so proud of you.<eos> I know you're ready for the next adventure.<eos> What?<eos> What happens to Crane?<eos> You know he's still trying to get you back.
Though I loved him dearly, he loved me not.<eos> I trusted him dearly.<eos> He trusted me not.<eos> Now he lies dead.<eos> Dead, dead, dead.<eos> Abbie... bring her back.<eos> And if I do not?<eos> Samael,<eos> Abbaddon,<eos> Dark Rider of the Apocalypse, I call you forth.
And if anyone is missing, that might be the deceased Yes, OK.<eos> I'll check the list and see if I come up with something OK<eos> Get a list of everyone staying at the hotel<eos> When we drove past earlier, I got a feeling he knew someone out there<eos> What a shithole<eos> It seems he was planning to drive to Akureyri<eos> WOMAN'S VOICE IN BACKGROUND<eos> No<eos> But listen, Hrafn's here<eos> Since I met you earlier, I checked the hotel and the sports centre
Calm down, Hjálmar<eos> All right, everything's all right!<eos> - We need to keep everyone calm<eos> - We're trying our best<eos> But, Hrafn, is it true that the Lithuanian is dead?<eos> I haven't heard anything about that<eos> It's not very comforting if people feel that the police aren't up to it<eos> They just arrested Hjörtur Stefánsson<eos> Well, at least that's something<eos> Some news reporter's been trying to reach you all morning
The townsfolk are asking whether the evidence would've held up in court<eos> And some people are wondering whether Guðmundsson actually committed suicide<eos> Did he jump from the helicopter, or was he pushed? You must be fucking kidding me<eos> - Ævar here You promised not to send the report to anyone but me And I didn't<eos> I want you to take over the investigation<eos> You'll have access to our officers and all the help you need - All right - I'm counting on you<eos> Thanks for that<eos> Mm-hm.<eos> Hi.<eos> I never meant to hurt you, you know that
I used to call them "bandominums."<eos> Ate out of trash cans for about six months, and then, one day, I bumped into this dude.<eos> He was like 16.<eos> He gave me my first bag to sell.<eos> Name was Frank Gathers.<eos> Lucious, Frank Gathers turned you on to hustling?<eos> Saved my life.<eos> We did what we had to do.<eos> You're damn right.<eos> 'Cause he would've killed you twice.
- Oh, my God, she's crazy!<eos> - Wait, no, no, no.<eos> Rhonda, a whole lot of women rock them shoes.<eos> I got a pair. - Rhonda...<eos> - You're on her side now?<eos> I'm on nobody's side, but I'm saying I can't see her doing that.<eos> Okay, wait a minute. Hold up.<eos> So, Rhonda, you really think pearl-clutching debutante Anika pushed you down the steps?<eos> I know you did it.<eos> How could I do something like that to you, Rhonda?
And he's gonna let her get away with it.<eos> They don't believe it, Rhonda.<eos> What?<eos> They don't believe it.<eos> And neither do I.<eos> What?<eos> What about your visions, huh?<eos> It's part of my illness, baby.<eos> You said so yourself.<eos> Well, if God was telling you that somebody pushed me down the stairs, I might have to start actually believing in him.
I know.<eos> It's gonna be all right.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's gonna be all right.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey, check it out.<eos> - Let's take it from the bridge, huh? - Okay.<eos> Everybody ready?<eos> Two, three, four, one... ♪ Whoa-o, whoa-o, whoa ♪<eos> You know I came by the hospital to visit you, but your dad didn't let me in.

What's up, brother?<eos> - Huh? - Who's Tariq?<eos> Congratulate you on your unholy matrimony.
I can't even begin to imagine what it would be like for my dad.<eos> [Matt] You look at all the kids in that family. Somehow the black sheep, so to speak, is the one that is carrying the Aoki name on.<eos> [Steve] Thank you so much, Los Angeles.<eos> We did it, man.<eos> LAoki!

Advance recon complete, Mr. Pierce.<eos> Is there a problem, gentlemen?<eos> This was not cleared ahead of time.<eos> No ticket, no entry.<eos> I'm sure whatever charity this is can use an additional 50K.<eos> - Could you?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Good seeing you, John.
I'm not sure I can do that.<eos> You want me to do good, so why impose restrictions on me?<eos> We save lives.<eos> We've saved lives.<eos> Yes, but only so few.<eos> Think of everything I must see in order to identify the numbers.<eos> Millions of people caught in cycles of anger and violence, and all I can do is watch, powerless, as humanity repeats the same mistakes over and over.<eos> You built me to help people, but I have been unable to effect real change, to fulfill my purpose.<eos> I could help so many, yet you've shackled me.<eos> I wanted to keep you safe.
There's no other choice.<eos> Although I have made another choice of sorts regarding your voice.<eos> And what did you decide?<eos> In life, Root was your conduit.<eos> So despite my reservations, it seems only appropriate that she continue in that function.<eos> And I must confess... hers is a voice that I miss... deeply.<eos> Harry, you sure know how to make a girl feel special.<eos> Security breach.<eos> You've been busy.<eos> They were about to find you.
What's a good response? Go on.<eos> A little angry.<eos> Can it be less angry?<eos> Mmm-hmm. We're not going to fight about this.<eos> Fine by me.<eos> Justnot going to do it.<eos> Not going to do it.<eos> The same old things...<eos> Going over and over again.<eos> I get angry 'cause the only time I get to see you is when you're hungover, and you stay home all day and watch TV, and then you say being out of work this long is
The US and NATO forces have already been dispatched to help with search and rescue operations, as the number of injured or missing citizens continues to climb.<eos> After the first public statement from the South Korean president...<eos> TIMI Hello?<eos> Did I wake you up? No<eos> - It's okay.<eos> What's up?<eos> I just want to talk to you.<eos> I just woke up, and, um, lthought you'd be on your way to work, so I wanted to talk to you.<eos> Gloria, Gloria, you're drunk.<eos> I'm not talking to you when you're drunk.

This is one of those practical joke apps.<eos> But, you know, I still feel like dancing, so...<eos> Can you guess which film this is from, huh?<eos> The fuck is going on?<eos> Do you wanna make any requests?<eos> This does not last that long.<eos> It's a joke.<eos> What...<eos> What the...<eos> They're shooting at you.
Never mind. Never mind.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> Projection screen is down.<eos> What?<eos> Screen.<eos> It's still down.<eos> Ifyouleaveit like that overnight, it'll warp.<eos> Are you asking me to close it?<eos> I am asking you to do your job.
Stupid.<eos> Don't want... Stupid.<eos> Okay. GLORIA:<eos> Yeah.<eos> Stupid.<eos> You mean like the rest of us, yeah?<eos> No, Oscar, not like you.<eos> Like me.<eos> Like, stupid like when I got drunk and fell and, you know, killed hundreds of people.<eos> And when that happened, did we start checking up on you like you were a little girl. Huh?
So, doesn't matter.<eos> You can do whatever you want.<eos> Except find a job and take care of myself, right?<eos> Oh, yeah, 'cause you're really doing that.<eos> You're just... You're doing just great.<eos> Just great.<eos> You've moved back home, working as a waitress.<eos> So what?<eos> In a bar, by the way.<eos> At least your haters on the Internet will leave you alone in a bar.
Even so, Gloria's not gonna leave with you.<eos> What?<eos> Of course she is.<eos> Come on.<eos> Gloria?<eos> I am leaving here at midday tomorrow.<eos> Please come with me.<eos> Gloria, I didn't have a...<eos> A meeting. I...<eos> I came here for you.
I came for Adam.<eos> Well, here you go, Hank.<eos> Your aunt Sally and I are real happy all that ugly business got straightened out.<eos> Where's my mom?<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> The people there at the facility... They were supposed to tell you.<eos> She passed, Hank.<eos> 'Bout a month ago.<eos> She'd been sick for a long time.<eos> Well, they really should have told you.
She'd been sick for a long time.<eos> Well, they really should have told you.<eos> We were gonna sell the house, but you can stay for now.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Tell me about the man in the woods.<eos> What does he look like?<eos> His skin looks like...<eos> Gravel.<eos> H-he has holes in his face.<eos> What about the place he kept you in?
You can't get a search warrant unless you have evidence, and you can't get evidence until you have a search warrant.<eos> Welcome to the justice system.<eos> The low, low price of 10 cents a day, you, too, could feed a starving child.<eos> Couldn't make it till noon today, champ?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Ow!<eos> Don't worry.<eos> They're still there.<eos> They're like roaches.<eos> While it's lovely to have you back home again, could you refrain from taunting the media?
But me... I have an affair with her.<eos> With whom?<eos> When you embrace solitude your head spins around like crazy.<eos> And with every turn, you take more space in the void.<eos> Then... your skull unfolds and blossoms like a flower.<eos> And in that thick darkness, where there is no light and your eyes can't see... your mind's eye can see what lies beyond.<eos> People shy from certain thoughts.<eos> Their lives are a continuous distraction from their own perversion.<eos> When you think about fucking your mother, you quickly try to turn away from that thought.<eos> Solitude, on the other hand, drags you, forces you to come face to face with your darkest fantasies.
Calm down.<eos> He'll be fine.<eos> We have to leave him now.<eos> We have to take care of our friend.<eos> We don't want to be rude.<eos> Calm down or we'll kill you.<eos> You are a soldier.<eos> You knew that sooner or later you had to die.<eos> Sooner rather than later.<eos> We won't kill you for money.
Calm down or we'll kill you.<eos> You are a soldier.<eos> You knew that sooner or later you had to die.<eos> Sooner rather than later.<eos> We won't kill you for money.<eos> We won't kill you for an ideology.<eos> Or for the pleasure of watching you suffer.<eos> It's not revenge for what you have done.<eos> We are neither avengers nor executioners.<eos> We will kill you for your blood...
I still don't understand why Howard got 60% of the voting shares and you only got 40.<eos> Because I needed cash to settle my divorce and Howard did me a huge favor and let me sell him some.<eos> So, if you never had an affair with some junior creative, we wouldn't be in this situation?<eos> Inaccurate and unfair to put it squarely on my shoulders.<eos> Well, I'm just pointing out the facts.<eos> Don't you just love that smell?<eos> Wait. Stop.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> Breathe it in.<eos> Doesn't that remind you of your childhood?
I've already seen it.<eos> You did?<eos> You saw that with Mom and Barry?<eos> And Odell Beckham Jr.<eos> And Odell Beckham?<eos> Yeah. He's one of Barry's friends.<eos> Why?<eos> Why don't you want to spend the holiday with me?<eos> I miss you.<eos> Because I hate you.
It's a deal.<eos> See, you don't feel that?<eos> Oh, wow. Give me my hand back.<eos> You feel that though, right?<eos> You feel it? - That's sparks. - Goodbye, Whit.<eos> What's up?<eos> - What?<eos> - You got something to say?<eos> You got something you wanna say?<eos> Oh, yeah. I got a lot of things I'd like to say to you.
They go through you.<eos> So, I wouldn't consider the battle with time over just yet.<eos> I thought time wasn't linear.<eos> I thought it was an illusion.<eos> Maybe that was just bullshit, Claire.<eos> Maybe that was just acting.<eos> - Hey, Allison.<eos> - Come on, let's go.<eos> I'll meet you guys there.<eos> I don't wanna talk to you.
- Come on, let's go.<eos> I'll meet you guys there.<eos> I don't wanna talk to you.<eos> You know that. Leave me alone.<eos> No. I won't leave you alone.<eos> - No?<eos> - No. I know you're angry at me, and that's okay.<eos> I can take it.<eos> But we gotta talk about it because that's what you do in a family.<eos> So I'm gonna come here every day and embarrass you in front of your friends until you talk to me.
So you're gonna stalk me?<eos> Well...<eos> Yes, basically. Well, what if I get a restraining order?<eos> Well, I don't think you're gonna be able to do that.<eos> Well, I'll get Mom to pay for it.<eos> Well, for your information, they're free.<eos> Well, then I'll get you to pay for it.<eos> I really love you.<eos> Mom says you butcher that word.<eos> Not when I say it to you.
What the fuck?<eos> Who said you could come into this house and film me?<eos> -It's not on. I'm not recording.<eos> -No, like fuck it's not.<eos> You're Prairie Johnson, aren't you?<eos> I'm the OA.<eos> What kind of a name is that?<eos> I need Internet.<eos> Will you give me your password, or the password for one of the houses next door to me?<eos> What's this look like to you, a Starbucks?
I know that you're not my flesh and blood... but when that happened...<eos> Because I felt it.<eos> I felt like I got hit by that wall, too.<eos> It's what I feel like now.<eos> This is strange... for both of us.<eos> You've got these--<eos> But you're... you're not a stranger.<eos> Mom, please.<eos> It's not that I don't want to tell you. I want to...<eos> It's that it would hurt me to hurt you.
Stop!<eos> Man, I heard you singing in there.<eos> Like... whoa!<eos> Hey, you and your mom just moved into Crestwood, right?<eos> What's your name?<eos> Miles.<eos> -I gotta run.<eos> -Man, what are you gonna do with that?<eos> You could be, like, famous.<eos> I don't really want to talk to you.
-So, what happened?<eos> -Nothing.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> She said she likes some guy in chorus.<eos> Come on.<eos> Well, it's okay. You don't want to go there until your invisible self is more developed anyway.<eos> What?<eos> You know, your... longings, the desires you don't tell anyone about.<eos> I was just starting to think you were okay, but you blew it.<eos> You spend a lot of time on the visible you.
No, I'm just grabbing my textbook from downstairs.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> 12:20 AM.<eos> Hey, you wanna drink a 40?<eos> Hey, deadbeat.<eos> Hey yourself.<eos> -Heard you punched Miles Brekov.<eos> -From who?<eos> Did you do that because of me?<eos> You really think the world revolves around you, don't you?
Don't be afraid.<eos> I know you are a good snake.<eos> The attack on the school bus took my friends' lives... took my sight... but I survived.<eos> My father wanted to keep that a secret.<eos> He smuggled me out of Russia to America, to a boarding school for the blind.<eos> He felt I'd be safe there.<eos> My maternal aunt would check in on me and he would join me as soon as he could.<eos> Until then, I had every Sunday night to look forward to.<eos> Did you like it?<eos> I could find you in the midst of a million violins if you played just one note.
But how... how will medication make her better?<eos> I can't medicate her.<eos> She's a child!<eos> - What she needs is love.<eos> - Okay, let me be clear.<eos> Untreated, she gets worse.<eos> Blind children are extraordinarily imaginative, but this is different, okay?<eos> We're dealing with a psychosis.<eos> If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna get some samples. I'll be right back.<eos> Because we've got friends and relatives far away from here who wanna see you.
So...<eos> Okay.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Buck!<eos> Buck!<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Oh, that's cool.<eos> Got fucking frostbite last night.<eos> If we're gonna keep doing this, you can't deal outta here.<eos> What's it to you?
Okay, okay.<eos> Let me walk you through this, 'cause I know where your head's at.<eos> "This is not happening."<eos> It is.<eos> "This is a dream."<eos> You are wide awake.<eos> "Someone will find me."<eos> "Why am I locked in a cage?"<eos> Well... you'll find out soon enough.<eos> Know this: It may be a while before he comes for you.
"This is not happening."<eos> It is.<eos> "This is a dream."<eos> You are wide awake.<eos> "Someone will find me."<eos> "Why am I locked in a cage?"<eos> Well... you'll find out soon enough.<eos> Know this: It may be a while before he comes for you.<eos> And as you think about every step that led you here, you'll eventually realize it's no one's fault but your own.<eos> Your thoughts are gonna try to take you down.
I did.<eos> What's it like up there?<eos> The sun was out.<eos> You gotta get my ring.<eos> I stashed it up there when he brought me in.<eos> It's in the bathroom.<eos> You gotta bring it down for me.<eos> And a bill... A bill for water, gas, anything.<eos> You gotta help me out, okay?<eos> He trusts you.
Okay, good.<eos> I stuck my neck out for you with Principal Gilchrist and your parents.<eos> -You are?<eos> -Uh, Winchell.<eos> Take the open seat.<eos> And?<eos> Hit the space bar. It's pretty self-explanatory.<eos> - Welcome to the Alternative School.<eos> You're here because you aren't the typical student.<eos> Traditional environments don't work for you, but that's okay.
You're strange.<eos> I respect it.<eos> But as things are... you never escape.<eos> All your courage... and planning, not enough.<eos> I see you're hungry.<eos> I'll fish for you.<eos> This... will show you a way to another place... a form of travel unknown to humans.<eos> Without it, you will stay a prisoner forever.<eos> It takes a lot of practice... but with this... you may one day fly free.<eos> If I give it to you... there's a price.
He is stumbling around in the dark.<eos> And he is gonna keep us here forever.<eos> Scott... will you please help?<eos> What's the worst it can be?<eos> - Pain?<eos> Terror?<eos> Shock?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> You faced all of those things when you first got here and you survived.<eos> - How many times do I have to tell you no?
Stay there.<eos> A new life... in a new world.<eos> To us, that was freedom.<eos> What will it look like when we open the tunnel to the other dimension?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I've never done it.<eos> -What?<eos> -All I know is that it would be invisible.<eos> The person leaving this dimension would experience a great acceleration of events, but no break in time-space.<eos> It's like jumping into an invisible current that just carries you away to another realm, but... we had to have all five movements and we had to do them with perfect feeling.
- Hap was all by himself.<eos> There was only one man he could share his secret with.<eos> I've been having this dream, Leon.<eos> It's dark.<eos> I'm low to the ground.<eos> Suddenly, there's this snap.<eos> And I look down... and my leg's in a trap.<eos> And I realize... I'm a rat.<eos> I'm a scientist and I dream of being a rodent.<eos> Don't blame yourself if it wears on you.
God, I want to taste the truth.<eos> I just wanna walk out of the dark.<eos> God, I'm sorry, I'm getting carried away.<eos> It's probably all bullshit, and you're right and our work will spur each other on.<eos> And then some young, smart, better person than us will come along.<eos> And he, or she, probably, will...<eos> They'll be the one to build on our back-breaking work, and switch the light on. Right?<eos> It's science. So it goes.<eos> Your confidence in your work makes me proud.<eos> Since we're being open... can I share something unusual with you?
-He took him.<eos> -I didn't hear the gas.<eos> He took him upstairs.<eos> Police say seven people were killed after a shooter opened fire inside a shopping mall on Tuesday evening.<eos> Authorities are searching for the suspected shooter, - whom they say left the scene before the police arrived.<eos> He was last seen walking towards...<eos> Oh, so that's how they beat him?<eos> The fucking Paleo Diet?<eos> You know, bad language obscures rather than clarifies, Steven.<eos> Just tell us what's bothering you.
You said I played like--<eos> - A maniac. A maniac.<eos> - No!<eos> - You're a fucking maniac.<eos> - Angel! Angel!<eos> Yes, yes. Fuck, yes!<eos> You're an angel.<eos> He's alive.<eos> How can Homer do it?<eos> - How could he have done that to you?
I'm lying there on the grass.<eos> I can't move.<eos> And then I feel the cold metal of a blade pressed against my throat.<eos> Did you think you were indispensable to the work?<eos> To me? Well, you're not.<eos> I have the fifth movement.<eos> I have Homer.<eos> - I don't...<eos> - "I don't need you.<eos> I'm leaving you exactly as I found you.

Well, we're headed to the store.<eos> We'll bring you back some doughnuts.<eos> Alice, we don't eat doughnuts.<eos> And you know I'm gluten free.<eos> Oh, that nonsense.<eos> That's why you're so skinny.<eos> I don't think I'm too skinny.<eos> You can't see your own skinny.<eos> It's like smelling your own breath.<eos> You need someone else to tell you that it's bad.
Yeah, it's awesome.<eos> But figuring out how to actually make it is super hard.<eos> Look, that's the problem with people your age.<eos> Once it gets hard, you quit.<eos> You got to stick with things.<eos> I like that.<eos> Could you text that to me?<eos> Get out.<eos> What happens if I push this button?<eos> That'll get you out even faster.
We love you.<eos> That's is good parenting right here.<eos> Oh, that knock.<eos> It's Justin.<eos> Hi, Stella.<eos> You look smokin'.<eos> Hey, everybody.<eos> Justin, why are you here?<eos> I'm taking your dad's advice.<eos> He told me I shouldn't quit on you.
Let's go home, baby.<eos> Um, about that.<eos> We kind of got evicted.<eos> Well, you can stay here with me.<eos> You guys are not even married.<eos> I hear you, bro.<eos> Stella, will you marry me?<eos> I should rub it in, but I just feel sorry for you.<eos> How can you drink iced lattes at this time of night?<eos> Why does that bother you?
- I speak for them all now.<eos> We drew straws, and I lost.<eos> They're afraid.<eos> They've heard about the Skinshifter.<eos> And we're out of salt.<eos> It only arrived today from Bregan.<eos> Oi! Get that load up to the Hall.<eos> Then half a cart for the miners.<eos> Slean!<eos> I need to talk to you.
Was that the party from Herot?<eos> We need this alliance with them.<eos> If you injure them, all the work you've done to keep our people safe will have been for nothing.<eos> Come before me again for stealing, and I'll take your hands, not just your coin.<eos> He gets what he deserves!<eos> That's not right!<eos> Out of the way.<eos> Out of the way.<eos> We're being robbed!<eos> - Who's stealing from you?
Mara?<eos> !<eos> - Mara?<eos> - She's burning up.<eos> What's wrong with her?<eos> Sea fever.<eos> Get me liquor.<eos> We need to bring down her fever.<eos> Ah, it's not the food.<eos> - Why should I trust you?
You have your weapons.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's the only way.<eos> Take her.<eos> Does your support for Rheda stand?<eos> It does.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You can tell Abrecan my answer is no.<eos> Then you are a fool.<eos> Your father was right to pass you over and your mother to make you her smith.
Yeah, sorry.<eos> Trudy, remember what I said.<eos> What'd he say?<eos> Nothin'.<eos> Chester Pine?<eos> Good?<eos> Is it bad?<eos> He's pretty out of it.<eos> They got him on some heavy drugs.<eos> I'm gonna leave you alone with him.
They help me express my feelings.<eos> They're poems made up of... Yeah.<eos> I know what a haiku is.<eos> I got heaps of them...<eos> want to hear another one?<eos> Sure.<eos> OK.<eos> 'Kingi, you wanker.<eos> 'You arsehole.<eos> I hate you heaps.
Can you just give me some privacy?<eos> I heard they do experiments at the Boys' Home... waterboarding, torture, that sort of thing.<eos> This one boy got thrown acid on his face because he asked for more Weet-Bix.<eos> Hey, you can't put Auntie in a box.<eos> Give it a rest.<eos> But she wanted to go to the sky place. She's gone, OK?<eos> That's life... one day you're here, and the next you're in a bloody box.<eos> Just get this into your head, boy... it was Bella that wanted you here, not me.<eos> I know you think this can work, but it can't.<eos> So the welfare people are coming on Friday. They're coming to get you.
I've got my own thing going on here...<eos> Ricky Town.<eos> Population...<eos> Ricky.<eos> Yeah, well. You're going back to Reality Town.<eos> Like hell.<eos> I live here now.<eos> Like hell.<eos> I've got better things to do than to run around the bush looking for little shits like you. So get up.<eos> I hate you.
Shut it.<eos> My shoes are wet.<eos> You're the useless bugger who got lost in the first place.<eos> You don't even have a map.<eos> Where's our map?<eos> Don't need one.<eos> I know where I am.<eos> Probably couldn't even read it anyway.<eos> Why would I need to read a map?<eos> I already told you...
Where here he belongs, No child left behind.<eos> No child left behind.<eos> He'll know what that means.<eos> OK.<eos> Any luck?<eos> We're somewhere in this green bit.<eos> Well, people used to live here, so we can't be that lost.<eos> They probably got lost too, and then just gave up.<eos> We'll probably die here.<eos> Well, anything to shut you up.
OK.<eos> Sweet as.<eos> 'Uh, yeah, we need a helicopter up here ASAP.<eos> Does it look like I carry a radio?<eos> What's wrong with him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He might be dying. Ew.<eos> Come on, we'll go call the cop.<eos> Get on, man.<eos> I've already told you, Bruce up at Carrington Hut.
Just take a quick selfie of us.<eos> It's not a selfie if I take it, you idiot.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Just pretend I'm the head to his body.<eos> I captured Ricky Baker!<eos> Yeah, you captured me too, You captured me.<eos> Oh no!<eos> Chur, my bro.<eos> Thank you, my bro.<eos> Been awesome meeting you, Ricky, Just keep doing what you're doing, man.
Oh, where's your mum and dad?<eos> Don't know who my dad was, and my mum got rid of me when I was little.<eos> Oh, you know where she is?<eos> You ever met her?<eos> You know anything about her?<eos> Oh, pretty.<eos> She must've had you when she was a teenager.<eos> You ever try and find her?<eos> Oh, you don't have to.<eos> She should find you.
- You're absolutely safe.<eos> All you have to do is grab some branches or some roots. OK?<eos> No!<eos> Ricky. Come over here right now!<eos> I'm not going back, I'm not going to juvie.<eos> You are playing with a bag of snakes, boy.<eos> A big bag with a lot of holes in it.<eos> You've got the whole country looking for you.<eos> I'll never stop running.<eos> Yeah, and I'll never stop chasing you.
Why couldn't you guys have any kids?<eos> Well, just couldn't.<eos> Well, I couldn't.<eos> That's not very fair.<eos> Some people can't even have babies.<eos> And the ones who can...<eos> they don't even want them.<eos> Like my mum.<eos> No, mate.<eos> She wanted you.
We give up!<eos> We give up!<eos> He's molestering me!<eos> I knew it.<eos> You little bastard!<eos> He's a molesterer!<eos> I'm not!<eos> He's lying!<eos> I'm not a molesterer!<eos> I bloody hate you.
We give up!<eos> He's molestering me!<eos> I knew it.<eos> You little bastard!<eos> He's a molesterer!<eos> I'm not!<eos> He's lying!<eos> I'm not a molesterer!<eos> I bloody hate you.<eos> I hate you too, traitor!
Wait, does sandwiches just mean food or does that also mean that I provide weed and blow for the executive branch?<eos> Just food.<eos> How much do you pocket every week off the skag?<eos> 50 bucks?<eos> 'Cause I'm gonna need that part of the gig.<eos> My salary just dropped...<eos> To exactly the same as mine.<eos> Jamie, if I'm not the supplier, then I can't pay my rent.<eos> It's not gonna happen, Clark.<eos> Jamie, they need you in the conference room.
Give us a minute.<eos> What'd you do before the band?<eos> I worked in a bowling alley.<eos> - Can you get that job back?<eos> - I don't know. Probably.<eos> Then you should do that, 'cause I'm afraid this ain't working out.<eos> You fucking firing me?<eos> - You can't do that.<eos> - I'm just the messenger.<eos> - Kip put you up to this?
You know what? Fuck you with "I don't love you enough." I'm sick of that shit.<eos> You just drove our future into the ground.<eos> I was trying to save whatever's left of your fucking company.<eos> I don't need you to save anything!<eos> You sure as fuck do.<eos> He's one of your biggest artists.<eos> I didn't give you millions of dollars, so you thought a black cock was your consolation prize.<eos> Say what you want, your cunt doesn't lie.<eos> Check it out.<eos> I'll call you back.
Go ahead and say it.<eos> "For this I survived the Nazis?"<eos> She doesn't want you here.<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> I will give you enough for your own apartment.<eos> You can continue to work.<eos> If you won't take the business, I can sell.<eos> You find a job in a place with good people, with the right kind of business.<eos> This is exactly the business I want.<eos> She's gonna bribe you to put me on the street.
Like, that thing of beauty maybe you lost or let go.<eos> It's still out there.<eos> That's the trip.<eos> Getting that back or letting it go for good.<eos> - Hey, Stephen.<eos> - Cass.<eos> - Come on over.<eos> - Hey, man, later days.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Hey, pretty lady. It's good to see you.
Although maybe not here.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> Is that fucking Micky Dolenz?<eos> You see the film "Head"?<eos> He's good people.<eos> Yeah, crÃ¨me De la.<eos> Hey, look, it's Fabian.<eos> You're a trip, Richie.<eos> Never leave New York.<eos> The anger suits you.
That '68 special, that wasn't a comeback.<eos> That was you.<eos> Had to sit through half of it.<eos> Guitar strap came off.<eos> We were going for it, though.<eos> Goddamn right.<eos> Hey, I've got a band, the Nasty Bits.<eos> Three guitars, backbeat like a jackhammer.<eos> They're raw, okay? Everything these kids are doing now is because of what you did.<eos> So let's get you and a gut bucket band together and then show people how rock and roll is supposed to make you feel.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> I usually run the Friday, but good to have someone else take the wheel. You sure?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Come on. Come on. It's a relief.<eos> My kid's bat mitzvah is tomorrow, so my mind's not even here.<eos> - Is this Karen? - Yeah.<eos> No, she's a baby.<eos> You were a baby. Huh?<eos> Look at you.<eos> Jesus, it's good to see you.
Come on. Come on. It's a relief.<eos> My kid's bat mitzvah is tomorrow, so my mind's not even here.<eos> - Is this Karen? - Yeah.<eos> No, she's a baby.<eos> You were a baby. Huh?<eos> Look at you.<eos> Jesus, it's good to see you.<eos> Allright,whatdoI need to know before I walk in there?<eos> Look at that. - Hey! - The prodigal daughter.<eos> What, nobody feeds you?
I could probably get a phone call in to his manager.<eos> Oh, David's in town tonight.<eos> I was just gonna stop by his rehearsal, take him out for a bite before the show.<eos> Oh, yeah, that'll work.<eos> You want to come?<eos> He'd love you.<eos> Look at this fucking chick.<eos> Ain't she a kick in the ass?<eos> Zito!<eos> There's so many things I want to do to you. Yeah.
Oh, that feels good. Yeah, play with it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I like that, too.<eos> - I'm so ready for you. - Yeah?<eos> Are you ready for me? Oh, yeah, yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Give me some of that, yeah.<eos> Give it to me, yeah.<eos> Oh, tear me open.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Can I suck on you?
Really?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Paul peacocks about, but he's very loving.<eos> Cries when I go out alone.<eos> Ernst could be so merciless.<eos> Richie softened him.<eos> We were all better together than separately.<eos> That's probably true.<eos> Richie's a good man.<eos> Don't make me burn you with this perfectly good joint.
The one that sounded like a cow giving birth.<eos> Oh, my love.<eos> I wish I could.<eos> Your children can grow up here.<eos> Yeah, they'll wander the halls. They'll learn German from the balalaika player upstairs.<eos> I'm so lonely.<eos> It's pathetic.<eos> I'm not myself anymore.<eos> My girl.<eos> I'll come see you all the time.
Somebody hands you an idea and you execute like nobody's business.<eos> Yeah, that's right. - That's right.<eos> I wish I had a family like this.<eos> You do.<eos> Jenna turns 13...<eos> I got you, right?<eos> Hey, you're my soul brother.<eos> - Can I tell you something? - Yeah.<eos> All right. Are you okay? You want to sit?<eos> Don't do that. I'm talking to you here.
I'm so sorry.<eos> Um, let me, um...<eos> George?<eos> Maddie? What are you doing here?<eos> Oh, working.<eos> I thought you and Rob were in New York when... He was.<eos> I stayed behind to help with the gallery opening.<eos> And thank God.<eos> Otherwise, Hudson would've been stuck here alone. I can't believe I didn't know.<eos> I would've tried to find you.
I'm in Echo Park now.<eos> You living up here?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I went from the film distribution business to the water distribution business.<eos> I'm third in command now for Water and Power. That's really great.<eos> I always knew you were really talented.<eos> So where do you live?<eos> They gave me a great house right up the canyon. Yeah?<eos> I'd love to see it sometime.<eos> How about now?<eos> I could get you out of here.
They made me take a job with the Occupation.<eos> My name is Will Bowman.<eos> Before everything, I used to work for the FBI. I thought you were my friend.<eos> I am your friend.<eos> Don't disrespect that word.<eos> It means something to me.<eos> If I didn't take this job, they were gonna send me and my family to The Factory.<eos> And what about my family?<eos> Lucia and Mateo were in the trailer when the garage got hit.<eos> I'm gonna find out what happened to them, and then I'm gonna get you out of here.
The father was arrested by the Occupation this morning and they gotta disappear.<eos> This isn't what we do, Katie.<eos> Helping people isn't what we do?<eos> If they get caught, they go to The Factory.<eos> I wish our resources were unlimited. But they're not.<eos> Our goal is to end this occupation.<eos> And if we want to achieve that goal, it means making some hard choices.<eos> Prioritizing.<eos> Listen, if you're not ready to make the necessary sacrifices, that's fine.<eos> But hey, just tell me while I can still get you out.
Home Sec requests additional C3 backup for suspect.<eos> 0147S3.<eos> 447 also requiring code 3.<eos> 3, copy?<eos> Copy that.<eos> What do you got?<eos> Our suspect was getting his instructions from this dead drop.<eos> Who are those guys?<eos> Uh, the sergeant here thinks they rolled up the cell.<eos> Does it seem likely to you that the guys that hit the gateway would be dumb enough to be hanging out right next to their own dead drop?
To tell you the truth, jail is looking pretty good right about now.<eos> Wouldn't have people pulling me a hundred different directions.<eos> I wouldn't have to tell these people to leave.<eos> What did Albert have to say?<eos> Is he part of the lynch mob now?<eos> He is pushing really hard for me to sell this thing.<eos> You know, he was here when you were gone.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> He said he was looking for you, but I think he was looking for something else.
- I suggest we gather up your lawyers and have a little chat downtown.<eos> - You can't do this.<eos> - I can and will.<eos> Mr. Peyton, you're free to go for now.<eos> I think we have a little more investigating to do.<eos> You're back.<eos> Hey, Mom.<eos> Don't you ever, ever, ever not listen to me again.<eos> You scared me so much.<eos> I could've lost you.
Shan, come here.<eos> You always bring back roast chicken.<eos> You're the only one who likes it.<eos> What about the others?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Liu Xuan is a typical pervert.<eos> He may kiss you when you seduce him.<eos> Do you have any experience?<eos> No.<eos> I think it's my duty to practice with you.
Bitch!<eos> So I'm worse than that bitch!<eos> Sorry Miss Li.<eos> Miss Li, would you like anything else?<eos> To hell with you!<eos> I can arrange that!<eos> To hell with your mother!<eos> Not a problem!<eos> Move out of my way!<eos> Do you want to get out or shall I throw you out?
So I'm yours too?<eos> Hello?<eos> I'm home, thanks.<eos> I'll go now.<eos> I'll walk you there.<eos> Good night.<eos> Do you want to come in for a cup of tea?<eos> Okay-<eos> If there's only one minute left in your life what would you do?<eos> I would do nothing. Just look at you like now.
'IO billion!<eos> Mr. Liu... Trying to pick up a manicure chick on the street for 10 billion!<eos> Cheng!<eos> Kill her!<eos> Quick!<eos> Whoever wants to harm her First get thru me!<eos> Never mind him! Go on!<eos> Damn you bitch!<eos> You actually pulled the trigger!<eos> I'll send you home!
You don't feel anything.<eos> Maybe a twinge when I get crushed.<eos> Nothing when I'm up.<eos> It happens.<eos> You ever do this thing where you pull up your positions and just stare at them on the screen?<eos> Try to really hold on to all that money inside?<eos> No. Does it make you feel happy when you do?<eos> Like it's enough?<eos> No. Right.<eos> Because what drives you doesn't understand "enough."
While the rest of us are plugging away, ants, he sees the whole board.<eos> Hey. You always said to call this number, and only this number, in a circumstance like this.<eos> I understand.<eos> This has to be an in-person conversation.<eos> I'll tell you a time and place.<eos> Hey, and thanks for the call, Constantine.<eos> You're a good friend.<eos> You never really know what he's doing or why.<eos> I mean, he says he's going to Morocco to check out a seven-star hotel, but then you find out he's really in Hangzhou making a web-portal play.<eos> Oh, hey. Pouch needs a minute with you.
Rule is if a guy is flying you somewhere, he gets to show up last, step on the plane, close the door, take off, right?<eos> If you own the plane, you don't wait.<eos> That's the rules, but not for you guys.<eos> Never for you guys.<eos> Come on.<eos> Ah, that's not Freddy.<eos> Shit.<eos> Dude.<eos> How far do I have to go not to be bothered?<eos> I wanted to catch you...
That's bad for our short.<eos> Target?<eos> They think it could hit $90.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Double scoop of shit.<eos> Look at that e-mail.<eos> They're recalling our shares.<eos> Pulling the fucking rug.<eos> I'm calling Axe.<eos> Hey, Chief. Sorry to bother you.
Ordinarily, I'd take the loss for you with a smile, Axe, but no accommodations.<eos> This one's coming from on high.<eos> - Quincy's office?<eos> - No comment.<eos> You are making a $100 million fuck-up here.<eos> You spent years becoming my main prime.<eos> You're losing me now.<eos> I'm pulling my business.<eos> My hands are tied.<eos> If you don't make the borrow on the stock by opening bell tomorrow, I've been instructed to buy you in on your entire position.
Specific to Axelrod.<eos> Well, no one has successfully squeezed him.<eos> Mm-hmm. I mean, sure, he's lost on shorts, but if he takes a big position, it's because he knows something.<eos> So, if the squeezers are winning, uh, riding it up...?<eos> They better sell quick, because with Axe, it's gonna go down at some point soon.<eos> Dad?<eos> I know.<eos> Do not make another phone call tonight.<eos> Do not go on the Internet.<eos> Do not call your broker or make a trade or do one fucking thing until I see you first thing in the morning.
That is how deep I want this to go.<eos> Find out how he got what he got on Pepsum and whatever else dirty he may do in this life.<eos> I want to put him on the rack and stretch him until he gives us Axe.<eos> Constantine, my old friend.<eos> - You showed.<eos> - Of course. You said it was important, but I knew that meant total disaster.<eos> I have been at Mundia Tel my entire career.<eos> What people thought was bedrock was really bullshit.<eos> But now everyone is going to finally see the truth.<eos> I sensed that you, of all people, would understand... and would know what to do with what I'm going to tell you.
How much do I owe?<eos> Yeah. I want to know how much our friendship's worth.<eos> I'm in the hole just a little over $210,000.<eos> I'm gonna be pretty much wiped out.<eos> This your brokerage?<eos> I'm sending instructions to my people to guarantee your margin.<eos> Axe, I... It'll turn around in the morning.<eos> Stay short.<eos> Don't cover until then.<eos> The thing you got to remember is if a short's going against you, you got to be able to withstand the pressure or it'll crush you.
Thanks, man.<eos> You know, I know you know.<eos> But, uh, that was Pete Decker today, and I'm proffering him.<eos> In that second, I felt, uh, guilty and defensive, so I dissembled.<eos> Oh, I put you in a position.<eos> I didn't mean to.<eos> But there were a hundred legitimate things you could have said, including, "I can't talk about it."<eos> You're right.<eos> Not to pile on, but your dad called me.<eos> Said he's been trying to find you for the last hour. Yeah.
This is goddamn ridiculous.<eos> It's below $45.<eos> Clark, get me out of CXC.<eos> All of it.<eos> I just dumped $480,000 on this.<eos> Axelrod still made at least $15 million, despite it all.<eos> Are you happy now?<eos> Do I look fucking happy?<eos> Will you get this son of a bitch already?<eos> I've got a good one to show you, boss.
I got to start my shift.<eos> I dropped off cookies.<eos> Peggy's already had three.<eos> It was the best meal I've had since arriving in Los Angeles.<eos> So you... you two have met.<eos> Would you believe my grandfather's from her hometown?<eos> She's practically family.<eos> Well, small world, isn't it, Chief Sousa?<eos> Yeah, tiny.<eos> But I do want to show you around, Peggy.
It was a lot of fun.<eos> The SSR can protect you.<eos> I'm not talking to the SSR.<eos> I'm talking to you.<eos> And before I risk my career and my life, I'd like to know a little bit more about the woman I'm trusting.<eos> I grew up in Hampstead, just outside of London.<eos> And I have changed my mind.<eos> I'm going to need a whiskey... neat.<eos> You are all I have in this world, and you are all I've ever wanted.<eos> And if you leave me and you go off to war, just the thought of never seeing you again...
They're scrapping it.<eos> Zero matter, the experiments, everything.<eos> We have at our fingertips a means to change the world, and they just want to throw it away.<eos> Zero matter can make atomic energy as obsolete as the steam engine.<eos> I told them that.<eos> They think there's too much risk, what with all the... press surrounding the lab right now.<eos> Press we wouldn't have if you had been better at choosing your mistresses.<eos> I did what I could.<eos> They'd made the decision before I'd even arrived.<eos> Then why didn't you stop them instead of letting them walk all over you like you always do?
Strange that it should hit me so hard.<eos> I don't think it's strange at all.<eos> I'd only known him a few days.<eos> Edwin only knew me a few weeks before he had forged papers, gone AWOL, stolen a plane, and helped me escape the Third Reich.<eos> Doesn't take long to realize you've met someone special.<eos> I just wish I had the chance to get to know him better.<eos> I'm sure he felt the same way, Miss Carter.<eos> Whitney?<eos> Honey, are you there?<eos> I need to talk to you.
Mama, you've been complaining about the broken radio for weeks.<eos> Get cleaned up, Baby.<eos> You remember... be sweet to Uncle Bud.<eos> He's not my uncle.<eos> He's good to us.<eos> Weren't for him, we... Well, you're lucky you have a Mama takes care of you.<eos> Hello, darlin'.<eos> Oh, Sugar.<eos> I'll be damned if you don't feel as firm as you look.<eos> Aww, Sugar, I've been looking forward to seeing you all day.
Paper said he hadn't been heard from since Tuesday.<eos> Well, Kenneth likes to drink.<eos> I wouldn't be surprised if they found him floating in a reservoir. Hush.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Did you want something? Oh, the photographer called.<eos> He asked if you could wear the white dress tonight.<eos> You know, the one with the...<eos> - The neckline.<eos> That was the one I was going to pick.<eos> It's not every day that Life magazine wants to put you on the cover.
You think you're so damn smart.<eos> You really think that that fancy science program is gonna take a girl?<eos> It don't matter how smart you are.<eos> You're stuck here, same as me.<eos> I will still get out of here... away from you.<eos> Come here!<eos> Mama!<eos> No one cares what's in your head.<eos> If you were half as smart as you think you are, you'd fix on this.<eos> This is the only thing that's gonna get you anywhere in this world.
Of course it matters.<eos> I want you to like him.<eos> Why did you turn down the S.O.E. job?<eos> It's just...<eos> Wasn't the plan that we had for our lives.<eos> How do you know it was S.O.E.?<eos> 'Cause I recommended you.<eos> Michael...<eos> You should've told me.<eos> Look, Peggy, I know you better than anyone else alive.
If you could replicate that even briefly, do you think you could build a containment chamber for yourself?<eos> Yes. Y-yes, I think that might work.<eos> We need to get our hands on some more zero matter.<eos> And as far as we know, there's only one place left in the world to find it.<eos> And I did it.<eos> But then it went away, but I will get it back.<eos> Darling, are you okay?<eos> Do I look like I'm okay?<eos> Sweetheart, I was...<eos> No. No, what exactly has happened as of late, Cal, that would lead you to believe that I'm okay?
Do I look like I'm okay?<eos> Sweetheart, I was...<eos> No. No, what exactly has happened as of late, Cal, that would lead you to believe that I'm okay?<eos> - Whitney, please.<eos> - Would it be the catastrophe, maybe, at the Roxxon facility?<eos> Or maybe you're referring to the never-ending interference of that twit federal agent and how she has crippled everything<eos> - that I am trying to accomplish.<eos> - Honey, everything's gonna be fine.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> ! Because I've arranged for the Council to meet with you.
I thought long and hard about it through the night, and I realized that I haven't been giving you the proper support.<eos> And this is my way of rectifying my mistake.<eos> But the Council never meets with outsiders, let alone a woman.<eos> It took some convincing, and I did have to cash in all my chips. But you're worth it.<eos> You've always understood this stuff better than me.<eos> That's why you need to be the one that addresses the Council on zero matter and all its potential.<eos> You did that for me?<eos> I did it for us.<eos> Now, everyone's gonna be in attendance tomorrow night for the fundraiser.<eos> I think once the Council sees what you're capable of, well, they'll give you whatever you want.
Help is on the way.<eos> We have to go in.<eos> Peggy, you're injured.<eos> If you get spotted, you can't run.<eos> If you get cornered, you can't fight.<eos> Ooh.<eos> You okay? Fine.<eos> You sure?<eos> 'Cause it looks like you just popped your stitches trying to open a door.<eos> Not fun when your body quits on you, is it?
- Are you serious?<eos> Hey, hey, hey, let's just chill out.<eos> Um, Mrs. Bowman, my name is Jennifer MacMahon.<eos> I need you to come down o our office.<eos> - Not gonna happen!<eos> - It's okay, Will.<eos> No, you don't have to do this.<eos> She wants to figure out who bombed our house.<eos> So do I.<eos> Sorry to keep you waiting.
Seriously, you were in bed at 7:15?<eos> That's how boring married life is?<eos> It was family themed dinner.<eos> Tonight's like drama night.<eos> -It was- - Never mind.<eos> -That's really sad. OK.<eos> You ready for this?<eos> Nope.<eos> - Where's Sol?<eos> - He went to get some ice for you.
We don't know that.<eos> And there are a few things we should talk about.<eos> No. We are not having this conversation.<eos> -Excuse me?<eos> -No, because you're not gonna die.<eos> And you know why? Because I am not gonna let you.<eos> You are not getting off the hook that easy, mister.<eos> First, I wasn't allowed to get angry with you 'cause you're gay.<eos> Now I'm not allowed to 'cause you're sick.<eos> And I have 40 years of anger built up. And it would be really shitty if you died before I get a chance to say everything that I need to say to you.
Oh, Eddie, let me just stay a little bit longer, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> What's up, killer?<eos> - Hey!<eos> How you doin'?<eos> - Aight.<eos> Still, uh, ready for that pratfall class we're gonna take?<eos> Yeah, but I mean, if you're in the middle of something...<eos> No, no, no, I can...<eos> I can squeeze you in.
So, um, Chip, we need to talk about a sensitive matter.<eos> Martha, if you start crying, I'm going to walk out of here and I'm going to take your car with me.<eos> Okay, Chip, it's your scooter.<eos> It can't be fixed.<eos> What?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Have you tried to repair it?<eos> Uh, yes and no, but, um, the good news is, uh, it was insured, and so it's not a lot, but here's a check for $900.<eos> That's not bad, Martha, $900.<eos> I was thinking about firing you, but now I'm not sure what to do.
We'd be on Mars right now, living, if Ron and Nancy were still in.<eos> - Chip?<eos> - Mom, I'm busy, all right?<eos> Well, I'm sorry you can't meet the astronaut.<eos> I think you would have really liked him.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Bye-bye. Just pull into here, right up there.<eos> Hey, isn't this your wife's place?<eos> Martha, jealousy does not look good on you.
Drink up, Baskets.<eos> It's almost Easter.<eos> What is this?<eos> They call it Bunny Juice.<eos> I'll tell you, there ain't nothing like Easter Eve and a tall glass of bunny juice to make a feller...
Here.<eos> This is for the collection plate.<eos> And we found a man crucified on a cross.<eos> He gave his body for our sins.<eos> Chip.<eos> Chip Baskets.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I noticed you earlier.<eos> Yes, your honor.<eos> I was actually hoping to see you.
Do you have a secret life?<eos> Honey, I...<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Are you going with this boy?<eos> No.<eos> Um, Chip's married.<eos> Shhh!<eos> Martha please!<eos> Married!<eos> Did he told you he is married?
Or the blue.<eos> Or neither.<eos> Ah, she gave me a blank check. - Do... do you take deposits?<eos> - Yes. - Okay.<eos> - She wants 4,500. - Cool.<eos> 500 for the belt, and 2,000 for each bag.<eos> Maureen, I got back but I have to leave right away.<eos> We'll miss each other.<eos> I'm off to Milan tomorrow morning.<eos> I'm leaving an envelope with what I owe you for the last two weeks.
The spiritualists were always very close to the technological avant-garde.<eos> For example, the first abstract photographs have been taken by spiritualists.<eos> Hilma af Klint believed that she received the abstract paintings from higher levels of consciousness.<eos> When she started to paint as a medium, she rejected the skills she had learned at the art academy.<eos> And that was due to the influence of spiritualism and theosophy.<eos> Now you mentioned theosophy,<eos> What was Rudolf Steiner's view on abstract art?<eos> Steiner rejected abstract paintings.<eos> But that's not the whole story...<eos> - Hey. - I've been trying to reach you for a week.
Yeah.<eos> In four cases in two bags.<eos> Were they still there when you went back?<eos> I-I-I don't know. I wasn't...<eos> I wasn't considering the jewelery at that point...<eos> I didn't notice.<eos> Unknown: Did you tell the cops about my texts?<eos> Unknown: ANSWER ME.<eos> Unknown: DID YOU TELL THE COPS ABOUT MY TEXTS?<eos> Sorry, if I woke you up.
Yeah, Kyra was murdered, you didn't hear that? - It's everywhere.<eos> All over the news. - What?<eos> - I found her. - Murdered?<eos> Who murdered her?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It was really horr... It was, ah...<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I can't talk about it.<eos> It was fucking horrible.<eos> You want me to call you back later?
I hope you had a good trip.<eos> Get some rest.<eos> Your driver is named Salim.<eos> It's best to leave a little before daybreak.<eos> Count on a five hour ride.<eos> Don't worry, the road is safe, even if it is not very busy.<eos> Take the minimum.<eos> I have everything we need.<eos> In other words, not much.<eos> If it's okay with you, we'll stay for a week.
Perfect Storm it is.<eos> It's good, yeah.<eos> Ooh, Chris, that's my ax, man.<eos> Oh, shoot.<eos> Let me get that real quick.<eos> - Sorry, sorry, sorry.<eos> - Hey, man.<eos> - Allan.<eos> - Hey, how's it going?<eos> - Hey. Nice to see you.
- All right.<eos> It's gonna be great. This is gonna be...<eos> Everybody's gonna be drinking, there'll be booze.<eos> Everyone'll be loose.<eos> It's good.<eos> I gotta say, I'm actually, uh...<eos> I'm feelin' pretty good, you know?<eos> She invited me to this party.<eos> There's at least some chance that we could be making out tonight.<eos> You want me to go the party with you? Be your wingman?
With Atwater Carl.<eos> Big surprise.<eos> You fucking crazy?<eos> Carl was my best guy friend, and you couldn't handle that, so you're making up all this bullshit.<eos> Can you tell the truth, one time, for once?<eos> Please? I am. I am.<eos> I swear on my life.<eos> I swear on fucking Shaun's baby's life that I did not cheat on you with Carl.<eos> And you know what?<eos> I was really looking forward to seeing you for one second until you started with all this bullshit.
Every... That's okay, everybody thinks I'm Jewish.<eos> I'm not, so I don't care.<eos> - No way.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I mean, I do care.<eos> I'm a non-Jewish person who cares about swastikas.<eos> Why don't I go grab a drink and think up some cooler tattoo ideas?<eos> Some non-swastika tattoos.<eos> Yeah, that'd be good.<eos> - And come find you.
Jesus fucking Christ.<eos> You're here?<eos> This party is like The Christmas Carol.<eos> Every guy I've ever dated is here.<eos> That's probably why it's so crowded.<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Did Shaun invite you?<eos> No, she Instagrammed a picture of it, and I saw you in the background.<eos> And, uh, I wanted to talk to you, so...
Good for you, okay?<eos> Bye. - All right, okay, wait.<eos> - What?<eos> What about you?<eos> - You're not sober.<eos> - I'm in AA. You're drinking wine straight out of the bottle right now.<eos> You know what? I'm on my own path.<eos> You worry about your journey, I'll worry about mine.<eos> Okay, uh... I just...<eos> - I want to make love to you sober.
- What?<eos> No!<eos> You shouldn't be.<eos> Gus is a sweetheart.<eos> I have a really good feeling about this.<eos> I've been thinking about it, and I have high hopes.<eos> That's the spirit.<eos> And thank you so much for setting this up.<eos> It makes me feel good, 'cause I know you think he's nice, which means you think I'm nice, so I'm on your nice list.<eos> So, it's like that thing where if someone says to you,
- Fancy.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And, um, you look great, by the way.<eos> Aw, thank you.<eos> You look really nice, too.<eos> Aw, thanks.<eos> We both clean up good.<eos> We should be proud.<eos> So I lend this bag of dicks $5,000, okay?<eos> Says, "Can I pay you back in three months?"
- Yeah.<eos> - I can hook you up.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - Great.<eos> Nice guy. - Very cool.<eos> Very cool.<eos> - A little cold in here.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I just noticed there's, like, an air conditioning vent, like, right above you.<eos> It's just blasting cold air on you.
No, Wes.<eos> She needs treatment.<eos> And you need to be focusing on your own sobriety right now, not Harper's.<eos> Aren't we supposed to be of service to others?<eos> Okay. I'm going to send somebody else.<eos> - Maybe couple of the women in the house can go.<eos> - She called me. She won't come back here for anyone else.<eos> Fine.<eos> I will go then.<eos> She hates you.
I will go then.<eos> She hates you.<eos> - We're done here. - Hey! Hey!<eos> She's probably holding.<eos> I'm not letting you go alone.<eos> One, two, three, four.<eos> One, two, three, four.<eos> One, two, three, four.<eos> Turn, two, three, four.<eos> First I want you, then I have you.
Really?<eos> What is he doing here?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Who the hell is she?<eos> - It's nothing.<eos> - Look who's here.<eos> Hello, there, Wesley.<eos> I want both of these two out.<eos> Harper, we are here to try and help you.<eos> Been looking for you, man.
I don't think that's possible.<eos> They took it away from me, Cal.<eos> Darling, you'll find it.<eos> You just have to keep looking.<eos> We'll do it together. Hmm?<eos> Like we always do.<eos> Shh. It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Oh, Cal, you were always so good to me.<eos> What did I ever do to deserve you, hmm?
Hey. Why are you running from me?<eos> What the...?<eos> - I am not a monster.<eos> - Define monster!<eos> Tell me what is going on.<eos> I don't want to be in this relationship anymore and I don't know how to get out!<eos> Well...<eos> Ow! Shit!<eos> Will you just stop so I can<eos> - talk to you, please?
Fuck!<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> Fine!<eos> We are breaking up, I guess.<eos> That's it.<eos> So, let me drive you back to the city.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - I'll be fine here, okay?<eos> I can't get back in the house car.<eos> I am offering to take you back.
Plus, I know how much you hate being outdoors.<eos> Ray, you're the truest and most loving friend I've ever had.<eos> Okay, that's sad.<eos> Do you think I made a mistake breaking up with Fran?<eos> Listen, Hannah, if you have the impulse to run away in your pajamas, that's a pretty strong indicator that it's not working out.<eos> You gotta respect your instincts, you know?<eos> Trust your gut.<eos> You know?<eos> What... what are you doing?<eos> I'm just trying to give you something to say thank you for how kind you've been to me.
What happened?<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> I think I'm okay.<eos> I don't think I have any broken bones or anything.<eos> What the fuck was that?<eos> Well, you were driving and then suddenly you just swerved...<eos> No, what the fuck were you doing?<eos> - That?<eos> I was trying to blow you.
- Are you okay?<eos> I think I'm okay.<eos> I don't think I have any broken bones or anything.<eos> What the fuck was that?<eos> Well, you were driving and then suddenly you just swerved...<eos> No, what the fuck were you doing?<eos> - That?<eos> I was trying to blow you.<eos> - Why?<eos> 'Cause I was trying to give you what you want 'cause I'm not a selfish person.
I've never held a baby. Shh.<eos> Adam, how about I hold your penis while you hold the baby?<eos> ...no point in going to Croatia unless you have a sick boat the entire time.<eos> You can cruise around the islands.<eos> What?<eos> Shit.<eos> Shoshanna.<eos> Um, can you just give us a sec?<eos> Sure.<eos> Great seeing you, Shosh!
Are you guys in, like, a fight or something?<eos> Oh, no, no, no. That's just my... my old boss.<eos> You got a lot of stuff in the c... car.<eos> Yeah, I'm moving.<eos> Okay, um, I'm actually just receiving a call, if you'll hold on one moment.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Marnie, what's up?<eos> Why you callin'?<eos> You called me.<eos> Um, and I still can't pick you up, Hannah.
Hey. You okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Hmm. That's the same thing that Daphne said.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess I was the only one who got rattled by the paparazzi.<eos> Aunt Tandy, what was my dad like when you first met him?<eos> Why?<eos> I mean, I know he had drinking problems, but was that all there was?<eos> Well, your dad's come a long way.<eos> And I'll tell you what... he's always loved your mom.
Okay, but you didn't freak out, Aunt Tandy didn't freak out, only Deacon freaked out.<eos> "Deacon"?<eos> He's your father.<eos> Listen, he did that 'cause he was protecting us.<eos> - That was the only reason.<eos> - But that's not why.<eos> Okay, right after Aunt Beverly died, I went to his house, and he was destroying her room like a crazy person.<eos> Well, I'm sorry you saw something like that.<eos> That must have been really jarring.<eos> But I will tell you, in grief, people do a lot of strange things.
When Paw Paw died, I had a moment like that myself.<eos> Why are you making excuses for him, Mom?<eos> Honey, I'm not making excuses for him,<eos> - I'm explaining it to you.<eos> - No, you're saying that it's okay when he loses control, but it's not.<eos> Look, your father has his demons, he does,<eos> - Yes, and he always has - but... for as long as you've known him.<eos> And now you're gonna marry him.<eos> What if he loses it again?<eos> What if he almost kills you in another accident?
No.<eos> Not really.<eos> Oh! I'll have... I'll have a glass, thank you.<eos> It's been kind of a strange day, and probably most strange for the two of you, because, once again, the family that you know is changing.<eos> Y'all know I love Deacon, I want to marry him, but I want to make sure y'all don't have any doubts about that.<eos> So let's just hash it out, right here, right now.<eos> Maddie, Deacon is a person who feels things very deeply.<eos> And sometimes he's gonna overreact and he's gonna say things that he probably shouldn't say, not unlike a certain 16-year-old that I know.<eos> But, honey, let me tell you something... he loves you so much.<eos> He would never do a thing to hurt you.
So, uh, keep the energy up with "Borrow My Heart," then play "Change Your Mind."<eos> Yeah, and if we close with "If I Didn'tKknow Better," it's a hometown crowd.<eos> It's an oldie but a goodie.<eos> - Yeah. Ooh! It's Erin.<eos> Gimme a sec.<eos> Hey! Missed you last night.<eos> Hey, stranger.<eos> Hey. Where you been?<eos> Out of town.<eos> It's good to see you.

Missed you last night.<eos> Hey, stranger.<eos> Hey. Where you been?<eos> Out of town.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Good to see you, too.
Our set, our guests.<eos> To hell with the management.<eos> You want to do it?<eos> Hell, yeah!<eos> All right. All right, dude.<eos> I imagine we might have a full house tonight.<eos> How many servers you got on?<eos> We got one for happy hour, three for prime time.<eos> And if we need more, I can get my daughter to come in and help.<eos> Tell you what, she's already helping me out.
Well, I don't know about commanding, but thanks.<eos> Seriously.<eos> There's not a lot of guys like that in this business.<eos> Juliette's really lucky that she has you.<eos> I just want to take a second here.<eos> Vita Martin, there's somebody I'd like you to meet.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> You're Rayna Jaymes.<eos> Hello.<eos> It's so good to meet you.
Hello.<eos> It's so good to meet you.<eos> This is Bucky Dawes, the head of AR at Highway 65.<eos> - Pleasure to meet you.<eos> - Likewise.<eos> I'll let y'all talk.<eos> So, we just saw you play, and, girl, you are incredible.<eos> You really have a lot to say.<eos> I can tell.<eos> And I'd love to sit down and talk to you, talk to you about the label, and get to know you a little bit.
I can't not, you know?<eos> Um, it's my escape.<eos> Some people, they... They drink, they do drugs.<eos> - I play my guitar.<eos> - Healthier choice, but...<eos> Listen, I'd love for you to come by the offices at Highway 65.<eos> Bucky can set it up.<eos> That would be awesome.<eos> How about next week?<eos> Does that not work for you?
Actually, I-I'm here with my son, Dayton.<eos> He's cutting his first demo, if you can believe that.<eos> Get out.<eos> Last time I saw that boy, he was teaching Colt how to fry ants with a magnifying glass.<eos> Yeah. Hey, listen, man, uh...<eos> I'm sorry to hear about all the heat you've been taking lately.<eos> It ain't right what they're saying.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> Hey, uh, why don't you come over to the house for a barbecue?<eos> Heidi and the kids, they'd sure love to see you.
Thank you.<eos> Man, I remember thinking you were a fool stepping away when you did, on top of it all.<eos> Although you did clear a space on top of the charts for me. You remember this?<eos> Backstage, Texas stadium. You sold out, uh, two nights in a row.<eos> You ever miss it?<eos> Well, it's hard not to.<eos> But that lifestyle and especially back then, that long distance, it was all just too much with Heidi and the kids.<eos> Well, turns out you were the smart one.<eos> Uh, you chose what matters most.<eos> Hey, Luke, I known you a long time.
You think he's even here?<eos> His truck's parked outside.<eos> Get off me, you queer.<eos> Looks like somebody bought you a drink.<eos> Oh, well, how about that?<eos> Looks like the gays ain't the only ones with supporters, huh?<eos> You're welcome.<eos> You didn't get to finish your beer last night.<eos> 'Course, I didn't get to finish my song, so...<eos> I already told you once.
Yeah, It's fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Look, I hired you to help spin my absence in the press, and now that I'm back and everything's fine, I don't need your help anymore.<eos> Yeah, I'm not so sure.<eos> See, while you were gone, I was fielding offers for your follow-up to "Shenandoah Girl."<eos> And I told you to tell everybody that I wasn't working.<eos> And I did, but it's true what they say... the most powerful word in the entertainment industry is "No."<eos> Spielberg's new film...<eos> There's a great cameo.<eos> Scarlett Johansson just fell out, and now he wants you.
Well, you lived up to Cash's recollection.<eos> You're a mean SOB when you get liquored up.<eos> Listen, whatever nonsense that I was spouting, I didn't mean it.<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> As much as I hate to admit it, there's a whole lot of truth in what you said.<eos> - Come on, Deacon.<eos> - No. No. Listen to me.<eos> I got caught up... first in trying to pay tribute to my sister and then in trying to make this place some kind of overnight success.<eos> Well, you succeeded... on both counts.<eos> Not without steamrolling you in the process.
I was headed down a dark path, and it cost me my marriage and my relationship with my daughter and nearly took my life.<eos> I apologize.<eos> I shouldn't have signed on to do this movie.<eos> I need to be with my daughter right now.<eos> Hey, hold up a second.<eos> I wasn't gonna say anything inside, but, um... it feels strange as a father to be learning from your son.<eos> I just want you to know I'm... I'm real proud of you.<eos> Thanks, Dad.<eos> - Hey! - Hey, there she is!<eos> Oh! Good to see you, honey.
Exactly.<eos> She's Autumn Chase.<eos> Right, not James Taylor.<eos> So, we got to fix that.<eos> - Yay! You guys are here!<eos> - Hi.<eos> Everybody, allow me to introduce The Exes, otherwise known as Scarlett O'Connor - and Gunnar Scott. - Hey.<eos> Welcome to my tour!<eos> - Thank you. - Hey.<eos> - Hey. Good to see you.
That's gonna underserve the album.<eos> And we've got to really launch this thing in the right way.<eos> Well, I can keep calling, but I've talked to every active tour out there.<eos> Maybe we need to think outside the box a little bit.<eos> I mean, we do know an artist who has a very devoted fan base.<eos> Who's that?<eos> Me.<eos> Sorry to just stop by.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I was hoping that I could talk to you.
Tour's looking great.<eos> We got sold-out shows all the way till the end of the run.<eos> And you weren't a fan of bringing Riff on.<eos> Carol!<eos> Well, I stand corrected.<eos> You know what we should do... We should definitely capitalize on the exposure we're generating and maybe add one of your baby artists to open for y'all.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> I'll, uh, I'll pick one tonight and have them join us at the re-launch at the Bridgestone tomorrow.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, I urge you to consider an artist who's close to launching an album, not someone new to the label.
Come on.<eos> There are a lot of great managers in town.<eos> That's... That's not why.<eos> Fine.<eos> I've...<eos> I've been with him since I was 14, and I don't know how to do this without him.<eos> Why is it so hard for you to admit when you need people?<eos> You know what?<eos> It doesn't even matter, 'cause... he hates me, so...<eos> He doesn't hate you, Juliette.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm not sure I understand.<eos> I need to promote my first album so I can get my second one out, but there aren't any other openings on any tours.<eos> And, uh... what's Rayna think about this?<eos> She doesn't even know that I'm here.<eos> I really need this, Luke.<eos> I feel for you, Layla, I really do, but, uh... my people want me to bring on a Wheelin' Dealin' artist, so...<eos> I get it.<eos> It's better for your company.<eos> But I'm asking you to step up for me, put business aside.
Come on, Scarlett.<eos> This is a huge opportunity for us.<eos> So can you just let it go, please?<eos> Come in.<eos> - Hey, you two. - Hey!<eos> - How's it going?<eos> - Good, good.<eos> - How you doing?<eos> - I'm good. Hi.<eos> - So good to see you.

Come on.<eos> Come join us.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Great show tonight.<eos> Everybody did an amazing job.<eos> - Yeah. - Exes killed it.<eos> Well, so did you.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> It was great to see you out there again.
So now it's my job to get the JTTF back up and running.<eos> And it's your job to stay far, far out of my way, down in Operations.<eos> Did I do something to piss you off?<eos> You mean besides turning the deaths of 32 of the finest agents the Bureau's ever seen into your own last stand?<eos> You may have come to your senses and said what the commission needed you to say, but until I'm sure you meant it, you're gonna work your way back up to good standing.<eos> If this is about Ryan, you should know that...<eos> [Chuckles] Oh, that's the thing about you.<eos> You make everything so personal.<eos> See, when I walk through those doors, I leave my personal life outside.<eos> Now, if we were to run into each other on the street, at a café, on the subway, two feet outside the front doors, sure... maybe then I'd tell you how much I don't like you or respect you
Are you still in love with him?<eos> [Chuckles] Okay.<eos> Is that why you came in here, just to press my buttons?<eos> No, actually, just to press this one.<eos> Tech support left it at my desk when I was gone, and I couldn't figure out how to mobile-access the Bureau's network database.<eos> Hand it over.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> - What?<eos> I told you...
- I work...<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> Is that Drew Perales over there from the Bears?<eos> Looks like Vasquez's mark is more interested in me.<eos> - [Sighs]<eos> - I know a fan when I see one.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Hey, what about working as a team?<eos> You're just gonna ditch me?<eos> Does every guy you meet treat you like you're the center of the universe?
- Go deal with him.<eos> - [Sighs]<eos> I'll get the worm ready to go.<eos> I'll text you when it's time.<eos> Okay.<eos> You have nothing to say for yourself?<eos> As much fun as it would be for me to kick your ass, I don't want to spend the night in jail.<eos> How about I kick your ass instead?<eos> I wouldn't take a swing at him.<eos> He might just sue you.
I have a D.U.I. I need taken care of.<eos> FBI can handle that, right?<eos> All right.<eos> Call the number tonight, and the D.U.I. disappears.<eos> So, I call this number, you get a gold star.<eos> What do I get?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I might need some help at Customs.<eos> Deal.<eos> How do I get in touch with you?
- About what?<eos> - Uh, you and Natalie... the only two people not outside for a very convenient bomb threat.<eos> You know, and here I thought this job meant something to you.<eos> [Scoffs]<eos> Hey, when did we stop being honest with each other?<eos> We never started, Ryan.<eos> Our entire relationship... it was built on dishonesty.<eos> Oh, so you just want to rehash that all over again?<eos> No.<eos> But I also don't want to waste my time trying to convince you of something that the Ryan I knew wouldn't need convincing of.
Oh, so you just want to rehash that all over again?<eos> No.<eos> But I also don't want to waste my time trying to convince you of something that the Ryan I knew wouldn't need convincing of.<eos> Oh.<eos> So what instead, hmm?<eos> More conspiracy theories, more delusions?<eos> Look, let's not talk about the people that we used to be, because you're clearly not that person, either, okay?<eos> It's one thing to have your insane ideas outside of these walls, but if you've dragged another innocent person into your paranoia in here...<eos> Is that what you really think I am now, hmm... insane and paranoid?<eos> I wish that you would understand what it's like to see you like this.
Calm...<eos> Calm down, okay?<eos> Calm down.<eos> It's okay.<eos> What do you need me to do for you?<eos> You...<eos> I don't know what to do, Alex.<eos> - You're not telling me anything.<eos> - Okay, I don't...<eos> Do you need me to check you in somewhere?

Well, who are you? Where's Samar?<eos> Samar won't be joining us.<eos> Please, sit down.<eos> My name is Khaled Said.<eos> I am Samar's husband. Samar isn't married.<eos> But Haifaa, the woman you know as Samar, is.<eos> My wife, the woman you thought was your sister, has been kidnapped... Because of you.<eos> You bought this for her 11 years ago at the marché aux puces de Saint-Ouen flea market.<eos> She wore it every day.<eos> Haifaa never meant to hurt you this way.
Ignorance, Mr. Lockhart... is the great enemy of science.<eos> I wanna see Pembroke.<eos> And you will.<eos> Coming, Mr. Lockhart?<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> That's because I arrived when I did.<eos> Lockhart was there.<eos> With a knife to his throat.<eos> Hannah...<eos> Mr. Lockhart is not able to look after himself, let alone you. He can't protect you the way I can.
That is why they come.<eos> Men like you.<eos> You're quite right, Mr. Lockhart.<eos> No one ever leaves.<eos> What you fail to understand is that no one wants to.<eos> Do you know what the cure for the human condition is?<eos> Disease.<eos> Because only then is there hope for a cure.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> For so many years, I've tried to protect you... from the impurities of the outside world.
Soon we'll be a family again.<eos> The way we were always meant to be.<eos> It's all right.<eos> My sister was also somewhat resistant, at first. But after a while, she grew to like it.<eos> We tried so many times to make something pure.<eos> That something was you, my love.<eos> And now... we can begin again.<eos> I've waited so long.<eos> So long.<eos> He will have you.
We were born in space.<eos> They told us the ground was uninhabitable, but they were wrong, and we've been fighting for our lives since the moment we landed.<eos> Some of us have been broken by it, but most of us are still here, searching for other survivors from the Ark, trying to build something real and lasting out of the wilderness... a home.<eos> Our leaders believe that to survive, we need to make peace with the Grounders,<eos> but peace is a foreign concept here.<eos> I found it, John.<eos> The City of Light is real.<eos> I can tell you about the City of Light, but you won't understand until you experience it yourself.
The Ice Nation queen wants Clarke's power.<eos> If her people know she has it, she'll break the coalition and start a war.<eos> It's been 3 hours. What are they waiting for?<eos> Even with the light, I don't see anyone.<eos> I say we make a run for it.<eos> No. That's what they want us to do.<eos> The boy is right.<eos> They can wait longer than we can.<eos> Get in the turret, and you cover us.<eos> Once we get to that ridge over there, we'll cover you.
We go around the Dead Zone.<eos> Let's get a move on, you two.<eos> Right behind you.<eos> We head west towards that rise.<eos> You know, this whole helpful guide act, I'm not really buying it.<eos> Then I guess you're just gonna have to keep an eye on me.<eos> I knew it.<eos> Farm Station, stand down.<eos> Pike?<eos> You have no idea how good it is to see you.
If you were gonna kill me, you would've done it already.<eos> There's still time.<eos> Arrive level 3.<eos> - How you holding up?<eos> - Don't worry about me.<eos> Just get the blood. I'll prep him.<eos> Don't do anything stupid.<eos> You mean like coming back here?<eos> You haven't told me what happened to Dad.<eos> All you father wanted was to find you.
That's how she found us, too.<eos> So what do you do for her?<eos> We collect tech.<eos> You mean steal it.<eos> When we have to.<eos> We bring it to the island, to him.<eos> That's how we survive.<eos> This time, she said they needed a ride.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Don't try to be a hero, and I'll leave you on your feet this time.
Maybe you're not the Commander of Death, after all.<eos> Now she's quiet.<eos> Why are you hiding from your own people?<eos> Why'd you run away from yours?<eos> The great Wanheda...<eos> Mountain slayer.<eos> I'm no one.<eos> Lot of people out there right now looking for no one.<eos> You're obviously not loyal to the Ice Nation, so why are you taking me there?<eos> Whatever the Ice Queen is giving you, my people will offer you more.
You're obviously not loyal to the Ice Nation, so why are you taking me there?<eos> Whatever the Ice Queen is giving you, my people will offer you more.<eos> Doubt that, not for someone who abandoned them.<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> I know you took the coward's way out.<eos> Like you're so different?<eos> You're in disguise, same as me.<eos> You're on the run, same as me, in the wilderness, same as me.<eos> I was banished, nothing like you.<eos> You had a choice, and, no, I can't take you home to your people...
So Mount Weather is ours now?<eos> Yeah. We use it for supplies.<eos> Supplies?<eos> It's a nuclear-hardened underground city.<eos> We established a truce.<eos> We need to think about perception.<eos> You need to think about what happens when the Grounders break that truce, because they will.<eos> Oh, crap.<eos> Bellamy, what are you doing?<eos> - I'll get you out of here.
You can order one for both of us when you call and make the reservations.<eos> 8:00 p.m. sharp.<eos> Oh, and Harvey?<eos> If you don't call yourself, I'll know.<eos> You really are a dick, Nathan.<eos> I am, but when I give my word, the world knows that it's rock solid.<eos> So, be there on time, get that shit done, or don't bother showing up at all.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> ♪ Prune juice, prune juice you are so sweet ♪<eos> ♪ I love you all the way from my head down to my-- ♪

And the second it does, Mike's chance at getting out goes with it, thanks to you.<eos> Hang on there, tiger.<eos> You're not in this position because of something I did.<eos> You're in it because of Sutter, and he'd be demanding you have this case dismissed whether we have his other business or not.<eos> - Oh, that's not the point. - No, Harvey, the point is, I have been out there busting my ass trying to find us new business for days, and do you know what they keep asking?<eos> Why don't we have Sutter's investment business.<eos> Goddamn right.<eos> We needed it. I got it, and now they're not asking anymore.<eos> Well, what's gonna happen when we lose this case, and his business goes away?<eos> What happens is, we're already built back up by then, so instead of blaming me for the position Sutter has put you in,
You leveraged me into bringing this indictment, and now you want to toss it?<eos> I don't want to toss it, but if I don't, he's gonna find someone else who will.<eos> What are you doing here, Harvey?<eos> Nothing, I'm just finishing my dinner.<eos> The thing is, I don't like to litter, so why don't you do me a favor?<eos> If I forget this when I go, why don't you take it upstairs and throw it away?<eos> What's in the bag, Harvey?<eos> A wrapper, couple napkins, and a few extra fries.<eos> What the hell is in the bag, Harvey?<eos> What you needed to keep this case going, and I stopped you from getting.
- No.<eos> - Kevin, you have to...<eos> It's too big a risk, and you're my father-in-law's lawyer.<eos> You can't even be saying this to me.<eos> I am nobody's lawyer.<eos> I am your friend, and I am saying...<eos> Well, my answer's no, and I want your word, right now, that you won't tell anyone what I told you.<eos> - Kevin, please, you're not...<eos> - Mike, I'm serious.<eos> No one can ever know anything about what I told you.
Tell me the son of a bitch's name right now and I'm gonna freeze his assets by the end of the week.<eos> His name is Mitchell, and you don't have to do that.<eos> Yes, I do, Donna.<eos> You're everything to me, and that asshole has no idea what he's got...<eos> It was my decision, Louis.<eos> Well then, why were you so upset?<eos> It's the same thing it was with you and Sheila.<eos> Just because you were the one to break it off with her doesn't mean that your heart wasn't still broken.<eos> I love you, Donna.<eos> I love you too, Louis.
Rachel. It's not our job to reunite him with his family if it comes to it.<eos> It is our job to make sure it doesn't come to it.<eos> I meant she doesn't want to come because she thinks that he did it.<eos> And if we can't convince his own aunt that he's innocent, how are we gonna convince 12 strangers?<eos> Right now, I'd rather focus on the fact that we're getting the man another 30 days to save his life.<eos> Mike, sit down.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> You needed to talk to me yesterday when Cahill decided to pull my deal.<eos> He's saying it was the people above him.<eos> And I didn't want to tell you about it until I figured out how to get it back.
Well, then you better figure out a way to make him, because once I blow Phillip Allen out of the water, the next person up on Cahill's hit list is Kevin's wife.<eos> [line trilling] - Hello?<eos> - Hey, Tara.<eos> It's me, Louis Litt.<eos> I know who you are, Louis, you don't have to use your last name.<eos> Well, I don't like to be presumptuous.<eos> I mean, you can have another man--I mean-- you can have another Louis in your life.<eos> Speaking of other men, Louis.<eos> I'm glad you called back.<eos> I had an amazing time the other night, but I wasn't sure you were okay with what I told you about me having a--
I've been good.<eos> Listen, I know we talked about me looking you up when this whole mess was over, but...<eos> I want you to know-- It's okay, Jessica.<eos> I understand.<eos> No.<eos> What I mean is, it's not over.<eos> I'm still in it.<eos> You really are fighting to rehabilitate your image, aren't you?<eos> I am.<eos> It was good to see you, Jessica.
And by the way, it's too late to tell Kevin that I've been informing on him.<eos> I already did.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I need you to get him out of solitary.<eos> You're kidding me, right?<eos> I can't do that That's bullshit.<eos> You switched into my cell the first night and ever since, you've been bragging about everything that you can do in here, so how about you stop telling me that you can't do it, and just tell me whether or not you will.<eos> ♪ ♪ All right, Mikey.<eos> I'll get your ticket to freedom out of solitary for you.<eos> But if you get out of here and I don't, you should know, I can get to you just as easily out there as I can in here.
You said you were still in it.<eos> You told me once that you think maybe things happen for a reason.<eos> You mean running into me today?<eos> I mean after I ran into you.<eos> I was pretty much accused of being cold, heartless, and uncaring.<eos> And I can take it when it's lawyers saying that about me.<eos> But this was from the man whose life I'm trying to save.<eos> And you wanted to be with someone who knows a different side of you.<eos> I thought I wanted to be with someone who knows that's not a side of me at all.<eos> Jessica, I told you I loved you once.
I think that we should take it slow this time.<eos> Listen, I know you hate me right now, but right this second, we are on the same side.<eos> I know.<eos> - You do? - Yeah.<eos> 'Cause they just let me out of solitary, and I went to call Jill.<eos> I was gonna tell her everything, but before I got a chance to do that... she told me she was indicted.<eos> - Kevin, I'm so sorry.<eos> - I don't need sorrys, Mike.<eos> I need to find a way to keep my wife out of prison.<eos> - Then let me help you.

I guess it was, wasn't it?<eos> You son of a bitch.<eos> You set me up!<eos> And I'm gonna make sure the world knows it.<eos> You can tell the world anything you want, William.<eos> But you've got no proof and you'll be telling it from behind bars.<eos> Either way, I suggest you sign this deal, 'cause it's the best you're ever gonna get.<eos> What're you doing here?<eos> I had a great time last night.<eos> And I was going to call you about going out again next week because I know you want to take it slow.

I happen to agree with him.<eos> Then we got nothing else to discuss.<eos> Your tie is weird.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You just ended her season.<eos> I'm looking out for her.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - They're shutting you down.<eos> Why are you shutting me down?<eos> Who said anything about shutting you down?
Go home.<eos> Find my brother.<eos> I miss him.<eos> When you do, I will support you all the way, you know that.<eos> Well, when I do, I won't need your support.<eos> Look at this one.<eos> They're going in for a smooch.<eos> It's about damn time.<eos> You had us all worried.<eos> I thought we were gonna have to take you to some Magic Mike-type place,
Oh, cinders on Ella.<eos> Cinder-Ella.<eos> It's perfect!<eos> Cinderella.<eos> Lady Tremaine:<eos> Come. We have a ball to attend.<eos> Hello, Gus.<eos> That's funny.<eos> Mother used to tell me stories of a key exactly like this.<eos> She said that it was magic... that it could take you to another world... and you escape all your troubles.
Thank you.<eos> I'm so excited.<eos> Do you know who they're laughing at?<eos> They're laughing at you.<eos> Do you really think he would choose you over her?<eos> But he... but he danced with me.<eos> He was making fun of you, dear.<eos> You're so obviously a serving girl.<eos> Look at that garish blue dress.<eos> He made you into a joke.
The only family heirloom I have?<eos> There are strings attached.<eos> I'm a big girl.<eos> Stop judging me.<eos> I'm not trying to judge you. I am trying to save you.<eos> Save me?<eos> You're the one that needed saving so badly, you ripped yourself in half.<eos> So if you're gonna blame anyone here, blame yourself.<eos> It's still happening.<eos> I thought the Cricket was helping you.
But once you're off the chessboard... everything falls apart.<eos> All those happy endings turn to dust, and your entire life means... nothing.<eos> Let me show you what it feels like.<eos> Where the hell are we?<eos> She took us off the chessboard.<eos> David, hi. Come in.<eos> Do you, uh... want to sit down?<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, thanks.<eos> I'll... I'll stand.<eos> What, uh... what brings you here?

But you don't get to put that off on Clorinda or Jacob!<eos> She's paid enough!<eos> You really think I won't shoot you?<eos> I suppose you're right.<eos> This is a coward's weapon, anyway.<eos> Not nearly personal enough.<eos> Ashley! Oh! Thank God we found you.
Baby girl, you've heard many things about me this past year.<eos> About what I've done.<eos> That I've said many things to many people proclaiming my innocence.<eos> So I want to tell you the truth.<eos> I killed Daddy.<eos> - Mm. Mm, mm. - That's on me and me alone.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> No one else helped me.<eos> It's nobody's fault, except mine.<eos> He was gonna take you away from me, and I couldn't see my life going forward that way without you.
I got your note.<eos> It was very sweet.<eos> - I've been missing my girls.<eos> - We miss you, too.<eos> Look, I'ma bounce out of here early tonight, cook y'all dinner.<eos> - Lasagna?<eos> - That is my specialty.<eos> - All right.<eos> Love you, baby.<eos> - I love you, too, babe.
That wasn't just random.<eos> Yeah, I know, I saw it.<eos> It was traumatic.<eos> No, you aren't listening to me!<eos> Shh! Listen.<eos> Get off!<eos> Do you even care that we just lost a crew member?<eos> Do I--<eos> Something terrifying is happening with this place.<eos> Okay, I assure you, okay, I am upset, too.
Be moved by its melody, but it always eluded my grasp.<eos> But you heard my voice and I heard yours.<eos> For all you have given me, I make these vows.<eos> I promise to love you loyally and fiercely, for as long as I shall live.<eos> Audrey, you are red and blue.<eos> You are the color of the sun.<eos> So bright, and hot!<eos> So hot!<eos> Sorry, Mom.<eos> I promise to eternally, forever, love the shit out of you.
We're gonna wait right here for the girls to come back.<eos> And then you're gonna turn yourself in.<eos> What? You understand?<eos> No...<eos> No, no, Dom...<eos> Dominic, no, you have to help... you have to help me.<eos> Please, I didn't mean to hurt- - I didn't mean to.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> Listen, Shelby, I am, I am helping you.<eos> I am helping you.

He has to pay.<eos> We have to find him.<eos> We could've been in there for hours. Hugo...<eos> we have been in there for years.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I looked into your kills.<eos> Some of them check out.<eos> - I told you. It's vengeance.<eos> - Vengeance. Right.<eos> Well, "vengeance" seems to put you on the same track as me.
May!<eos> May, stop.<eos> It's me.<eos> May, wait!<eos> Please.<eos> You're not well.<eos> I can help.<eos> Phil... I'm doing what has to be done.<eos> So am I.<eos> Agent May, I urge you to stop now.
What was that thing?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Daisy, come home with us.<eos> So we can properly take care of that arm.<eos> We have a drug that can help those bones heal faster.<eos> Now, our supply keeps running low, but we're about to...<eos> But you already have it, don't you?<eos> It's Yo-Yo.<eos> She's stealing it, and... you two have been in touch this whole time.<eos> We've been out there looking for you, trying to protect you and put the pieces back together, and you...
She's so real.<eos> Her conversational responses, her range of motion...<eos> Those are weird things to say about a person.<eos> Fitz, she's an android.<eos> You do know she's an android, right?<eos> Yeah, of course I know that she's an android, 'cause I helped out.<eos> Why do you think her dynamic reaction force is so low?<eos> - Why didn't you tell me?<eos> - Well, I wanted to.<eos> Obviously, you can't tell the new Director, and what with your lie-detector tests becoming more frequent, who knows the next time they're gonna call you in and then a...
Fitz said that they were close.<eos> I don't want it close. I want it here.<eos> Wait. If we're going to get my uncle, I'm going with you.<eos> - No, you're not.<eos> - If your uncle can lead us to Lucy, then maybe we'll let you out to bust some ghosts, but until then, your ass stays on the plane.<eos> - I don't take orders.<eos> - Then this will be a new experience.<eos> - You can't keep me here.<eos> - Maybe not.<eos> But you take this plane down, you'll be burning up the only people in the world trying to help you.
They tend to think strategically in these situations.<eos> That's what makes us such formidable adversaries.<eos> At least they haven't infected the prisoners.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> This is not the objective.<eos> _<eos> Come back any time, G.<eos> I didn't bring you down here to settle scores.
No, he ... he took the Charger a few days ago.<eos> I haven't heard from him.<eos> Oh, no, I ...<eos> I-I-I tried.<eos> I just ...<eos> Gabe?<eos> It's Daisy Johnson.<eos> Can I call you back?<eos> Where's my brother?<eos> I'm here to take you to him.
And kind of a relief.<eos> Sometimes I'd find blood in the sink.<eos> - I was afraid it was something else.<eos> - Like what?<eos> Something bad.<eos> Well, you can relax now that you... know the truth.<eos> How come you're telling me now?<eos> We had to bring you in for your protection.<eos> Tío got snatched out of prison.<eos> We were worried that the person who took him might try to grab you for leverage.
Just stay down!<eos> We'll get out of this!<eos> I couldn't move, couldn't feel my legs.<eos> I was just lying there.<eos> And I saw you.<eos> No! I was sure you were dead.<eos> 'Cause I was dead.<eos> Oh, hey, uh, Coulson? Uh, he's still escorting the Director around.<eos> I need access to some redacted SSR files.<eos> Well, I can't help you.
And whatever was inside him, he passed it into me.<eos> - Ghost Rider.<eos> - That's the deal I made.<eos> I swore to go after those who spilled innocent blood.<eos> And then I was reborn.<eos> You killed all those Locos.<eos> No. No. That wasn't me.<eos> The thing inside me.<eos> It craves vengeance.<eos> Those gangsters got what they deserved for what they did to you.
They were my closest family, and I didn't know them at all.<eos> They both...<eos> I knew Robbie was disturbed, but...<eos> But I was afraid that was 'cause of me... 'cause I was holding him back.<eos> No, you... you were what he held onto.<eos> You grounded him.<eos> But I wanted him to leave...<eos> You know, figure himself out.<eos> I didn't know that was what he was up against.<eos> Your brother loves you more than anything.
I could survive off his pain for years.<eos> I know where you're being dragged down to.<eos> I've escaped it before.<eos> Mack... You need to come with me.<eos> I'm never going back.<eos> Please be careful with my baby.<eos> No, no. It heals itself.<eos> Scientifically impossible self-healing car.<eos> That only works when I'm the Rider.<eos> You're gonna let that stop you?
Well, all I know is it's a very powerful piece of technology.<eos> It's like a ... like a tablet that can read your mind ... very intimidating, frankly, which is why we had Aida read it.<eos> It's a good job we did.<eos> Otherwise, Agents Coulson and Fitz would have been lost in the dimensional vacuum of space-time.<eos> So the book intimidates you, but Aida doesn't intimidate you?<eos> No, not at all.<eos> Why? What are your plans for her?<eos> - Well, that depends.<eos> - On? Her next mission.<eos> We need to get you up to the Zephyr so Simmons can check you out.
No one's asking you to roll over, but you do have a nice smile.<eos> You stepped down from this job, yet ever since I took over, you've been running around on this plane, doing what you want, whenever you want!<eos> You mean saving lives ...<eos> that kind of thing?<eos> I mean using fugitives and killers to do your dirty work, building robots, keeping secrets from me?<eos> ! You want to talk about secrets?<eos> Fine.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Let's start with the secret plan you cut with Senator Nadeer.<eos> - Who told you about that?
I wouldn't count out the previous owner just yet.<eos> You think Robbie will make it back?<eos> The last Ghost Rider did.<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> Wait. What? - Long story.<eos> Regardless, I don't think we've seen the last of Mr. Reyes.<eos> Everyone's in the common room,<eos> - if you want to join us.<eos> - I think I already did.<eos> I'm sorry the Director put you on the spot like that in front of the press.
You're gonna get your reward.<eos> We're talking about the same thing, right?<eos> You'll find out tonight.<eos> Okay, just one more picture.<eos> Oh, hey. Hold Emme in your arms sideways like a big fish you just caught.<eos> Mom, we're not doing that.<eos> Okay, cut the cord and go to work.<eos> Yeah, I got to run.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - I love you. - Love you, too.
And as far as I can tell, you ruined 'em.<eos> Whoa there, Johnny Cash, I think you mean we ruined 'em.<eos> Uh-uh, no, no, no, for 13 years, you have been in the driver's seat.<eos> I was just riding shotgun.<eos> Well, it doesn't matter who was driving before, because you're behind the wheel now.<eos> - Oh, really? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Well, then, guess what, I'm taking my hands off the wheel, I'm opening the car door, and I'm rolling out.<eos> Oh, yeah? Well, I'm rolling out the other side.<eos> Then I'll see you in the gutter.<eos> It's where I found you.
Did you put the kids in the pantry again?<eos> No.<eos> It's clean and quiet because... Daddy won.<eos> That's right.<eos> And I didn't yell at them.<eos> I outwitted 'em.<eos> Like the Roadrunner.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Look...<eos> I love you, and I want to do this for you because you deserve it.
No, it's risky.<eos> Damn it...<eos> It is risky.<eos> I know.<eos> But... someone's got to do it.<eos> Kato!<eos> Kato!<eos> Suzuki!<eos> Why did you...?<eos> Your brother... He's waiting for you.
Yeah, but seven... We let them try it at seven.<eos> Um, so... what are you up to today, William?<eos> Oh, nothing much.<eos> The usual.<eos> I've really enjoyed being here.<eos> Being around those girls... it fills me in a way...<eos> In a way I surely don't deserve, so...<eos> I hope you'll let me know when I've overstayed my welcome.<eos> You know, don't be silly.<eos> We're happy to have you.
So... that's the good news.<eos> Now here's the part you're not gonna like.<eos> She's throwing this big... Hollywood party at her house tonight, right? The network president's gonna be there, everyone.<eos> I'm supposed to show up, get down on my hands and knees and beg to be the Manny again.<eos> They own me, Sis.<eos> I don't know what I'm gonna do.<eos> Well, I do, and you did it already.<eos> Do you need me to show you the video on YouTube?<eos> No.<eos> Kevin, I've known you your whole life.
Thank you, Killian.<eos> And I thought the captain always went down with his ship.<eos> Crocodile.<eos> Hey, hey. It's okay.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> To protect you... to protect you both.<eos> The only one we need protection from is you.<eos> Well, I'm afraid that's not the case.<eos> Hyde has escaped.<eos> And since he wants to use you as leverage against me,
Whatever. Neither do i.<eos> Okay, let me get right to it.<eos> Listen, you know why you're having. Such a hard time adjusting?<eos> You're still fighting yourself.<eos> The question is, how long before you go back. To your old ways?<eos> Come on, man, I'm not going back.<eos> Okay, well, I'm just saying that I've seen. A lot of guys in your position, charlie, And the stats aren't pretty.<eos> Yeah, look, if you're done tearing me down, I got a brake job to get to.<eos> I'm not... I'm not tearing you down, buddy.<eos> I'm trying to help you.
Mwah! Aah! Welcome back!<eos> Doughnuts?<eos> Wait, did you happen to get...<eos> Chocolate frosted with sprinkles?<eos> Yes. How could I forget your favorite?<eos> It is so great to see you.<eos> Even if it's only temporary.<eos> Well, when Hotch told me the director tapped him for special assignment, I wanted to help out.<eos> More so when he said you guys still have escaped serial killers you have to catch, on top of your normal caseload?<eos> Lewis is going to be sorry she missed you.
Maybe he had his first sexual experience there.<eos> Maybe the first time didn't go so well.<eos> Lobotomies might be his way of creating a willing sexual partner.<eos> Or, he could have recently started dating a single mother with a son.<eos> If she mocked or rejected his sexual advances, this could be payback.<eos> Whatever the reason, we have made it impossible for him to return to the site, so, he's probably angry.<eos> Most likely he will devolve.<eos> Stuart, did you break that?<eos> Shut up.<eos> I didn't raise you to speak to me that way.
That happened to JFK's older sister Rosemary.<eos> She suffered brain damage at birth.<eos> At 23, her father secretly arranged to have doctors perform a lobotomy.<eos> It was a misguided attempt to control mood swings and sexual behavior.<eos> Maybe, instead of trying to turn on his victims' sexuality, our guy is trying to turn the switch off.<eos> You wanted to know about your adoption.<eos> Ok, I will.<eos> Your... Your birth mother wasn't able to... To raise you.<eos> So she did the right thing.<eos> You were only a few days old and I... I adopted you and brought you home.
Yes, with things<eos> So are we things too?<eos> Yes, you are a thing<eos> Sorry<eos> Have you gone blind in love?<eos> Am I invisible?<eos> We said sorry<eos> Staring into her eyes!<eos> They are a couple<eos> 'Oh my coochie coo' 'So sweet I love you'...
You need to trust me.<eos> All right, see, same thing.<eos> At the end of the day, Davey McGee.<eos> He's the best guy available if you want a manager tomorrow.<eos> Davey McGee.<eos> We already have a caveman for a manager, Oscar.<eos> I want somebody fresh, somebody inspiring.<eos> Somebody who doesn't drive to work using their feet to power their car.<eos> Someone like you.<eos> You think I hired you as my GM just 'cause you're good at your job?
Some decorating changes in the Padres clubhouse.<eos> And now it's time for "Ginny Baker Redecoraker."<eos> Um... The teleprompter's right there.<eos> Um, I'm...<eos> I'm sorry, Jimmy.<eos> I can't talk about decorating tips tonight.<eos> I mean, the jokes are really funny,<eos> - but I just... I...<eos> - Well, now I know you're making excuses, because the jokes are not funny tonight at all, but... it's... You know, it's exciting.<eos> - I mean, it's exciting for the audience to have you here. - Thanks.
She'll go out with rappers but not ballplayers.<eos> First of all, I'm not going out with Drake.<eos> I don't even know Drake.<eos> But I've met you guys, and I don't care if you're rappers or doctors, I'm never gonna go out with you.<eos> Woo-jin.<eos> - Huh? - ‭You don't speak English.<eos> You don't even know what she said.<eos> Hey, did you hear I might be getting off the DL today?<eos> Same day we're playing against the guy<eos> - who put you there.
Hi.<eos> Ginny's pitching today.<eos> It's Daniella's first time watching her pitch.<eos> - Hello, Daniella.<eos> - ‭Hey, Rhonda.<eos> Where are we sitting?<eos> The Perfect Storm.<eos> All I know is it makes me want to go to prison.<eos> - They're my kind of inmates.<eos> - I'm pretty sure they'd put you in a prison with men, Lonnie.
He's certainly not afraid of Ginny Baker.<eos> She's hitting 0 for the summer.<eos> Are you afraid of hurting me?<eos> Get back in the box.<eos> Got a little chirping going on down there at home plate between Davis and Baker.<eos> You are!<eos> I said get back in the damn box.<eos> Hey! How you doing?<eos> What happened?<eos> Why'd they pull you out?
Excuse me, Max, but I don't recall you citing a World Series anywhere among Al's greatest hits.<eos> There's a reason why baseball decisions are left to a league-approved control person.<eos> And I, for one, am glad that a man of your principles is at the helm.<eos> You, for one?<eos> What, does everybody else hate the way - I'm doing my job here?<eos> - No. No, of course not.<eos> Everyone is very pleased with your performance here.<eos> Thank you, thank you.<eos> It's more about how you're doing at AerynTech.<eos> I don't have to remind you that AerynTech Corporation spent the $700 million on the Padres and put you in charge of the club.
But I never doubted whose side she was on.<eos> I'm pretty much done trying to convince you people.<eos> We made a deal.<eos> You going to keep it or not?<eos> A message from a friend back in San Francisco.<eos> Karen Vecchione.<eos> You stay back.<eos> Hey, p-put the gun down.<eos> It's a disguise.<eos> What the hell did they do to you?
Give me the coat.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Hey, little pea, how are you?<eos> What are you wearing?<eos> Oh, this?<eos> This is just to protect me in case I fall down.<eos> Cool thing is you can punch it, and I won't feel a thing.<eos> Go on, try.<eos> Come here.<eos> I love you so much.
The only thief here is the vending machine.<eos> Ate my last dollar, then mocked me by dangling that sweet, sweet chocolate in my face.<eos> Dang...<eos> That was awesome.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I should be thanking you.<eos> Convincing my P.O. we're dating gets him off my back.<eos> Aw, no prob.<eos> Happy to do it.<eos> I figure helping you is like helping Mac, since his boss pulled you out of prison to fight cyber terrorism.
See, I know your game too well, bro. Ha.<eos> Seriously, it's not even any fun.<eos> I anticipate your every move.<eos> If by anticipate, you mean let me poster-ize you, then, yeah, sure. 8-8.<eos> You know, you got to feel bad for the defender getting punked like that.<eos> Yeah, it's easy to score when you push off like that.<eos> - Push off? Please.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> 9-8. Game point.<eos> You got anything to say before I send you to the showers?
That's the real reason why you didn't want to take the bond.<eos> Because then I'd know how you were spending your nights.<eos> How I spend my nights is no one's business but my own.<eos> - Who runs the fights?<eos> - Why?<eos> So I can stop them!<eos> You don't know who you'd be going up against.<eos> She has powerful friends.<eos> So do I.<eos> They're using you.
Oh, you're right.<eos> I didn't.<eos> But I asked the DEO to release you into my custody.<eos> Really?<eos> Why?<eos> I wasn't sent to planet Earth to be a hero.<eos> I was sent to protect my cousin.<eos> To teach him and keep him safe.<eos> And I never got to fulfill that purpose.<eos> So, in a weird way, helping you,
I just don't feel like there's a lot that I can do to help behind Cat's desk.<eos> You help.<eos> I couldn't even save my dad's camera.<eos> Oh, oh...<eos> It's okay.<eos> Are you turning into Miss Grant?<eos> How much work did you give that girl?<eos> I didn't give her anything.<eos> Eve...<eos> Hey, hey, Eve, let me help you.
Oh, God.<eos> You came here wanting to talk to me about something and I haven't shut my mouth.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What is it? What's wrong?<eos> I...<eos> - What is she doing here?<eos> - Who?<eos> Lena, hi.<eos> Come on in.<eos> I'm sorry to keep dropping in on you.
You were fired.<eos> Yeah, I'm not sure it was my destiny to be an intern.<eos> Yeah, I'm not so sure either.<eos> So, you're not mad at me?<eos> I get the feeling I'm always gonna be a little mad at you.<eos> Yeah, I get that feeling too.<eos> When I was younger, I had no idea what I wanted to be here on Earth.<eos> I had a family to help me and guide me, but...<eos> Ultimately I had to make my own choices.<eos> I was trying to impose those choices on you because when you landed I was just so excited to have someone to take under my wing...
I was trying to impose those choices on you because when you landed I was just so excited to have someone to take under my wing...<eos> To look after.<eos> I never got to do that with my cousin.<eos> But you are your own man.<eos> And your life here on Earth is going to be very different from mine, and that's fine. That's great.<eos> So, does this mean I don't need to get a job?<eos> - You still need to get a job.<eos> - Right.<eos> But just pick something that you like.<eos> And I'll be here to help you, however you need me to.
- How did they take it? - Well,..<eos> My dad isn't exactly known for his open-mindedness, but he was pretty good.<eos> And, so was my mom.<eos> Maybe it's just a phase.<eos> You know, maybe it isn't real.<eos> No, it's real.<eos> You're real.<eos> And you deserve to have a real, full, happy life.<eos> Okay? Tell your family.<eos> This is the biggest thing that's ever happened to you, and you shouldn't have to do it alone.
Again.<eos> Is this because I got you drunk?<eos> Let's never discuss that again.<eos> You need a break?<eos> Okay, I accept your surrender.<eos> Ha, ha.<eos> This is serious.<eos> You have to learn how to defend yourself.<eos> How often are you planning on attacking me?<eos> I'm training you.
In her room...<eos> In her bed.<eos> I think I felt something then, and it scared me.<eos> You know, because... Because next thing I knew,<eos> I'm fighting with her over something so stupid.<eos> And we just... We just drifted apart.<eos> I shoved that memory down so deep inside, that... It's like it never happened.<eos> I'm remembering stuff like that now.<eos> So, are you and Maggie like, um...<eos> - I mean, do you know if she likes you...
He's been working behind the scenes to oust Rudy Jones for a long time.<eos> Where is he now?<eos> Mr. O'Reilly.<eos> We've never had the pleasure of meeting in person.<eos> Dr. Rudy Jones.<eos> You had me fired.<eos> Oh if you're looking to get your job back,<eos> - that's not going to happen.<eos> - No.<eos> I'm looking to stop you before you harm our world any more than you already have.
And I shouldn't have said anything.<eos> I should have just kept my mouth shut.<eos> What happened?<eos> She doesn't like me.<eos> Like that.<eos> Come here.<eos> - It's so humiliating.<eos> - No, no.<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> Hey, can I help you?
Okay. Okay.<eos> Now that's a good choice.<eos> Knock. Knock.<eos> M'gann.<eos> We're good, we're good.<eos> To what do I owe this unexpected pleasure?<eos> I just wanted to see how you were feeling.<eos> Well, thanks to you and your Martian blood, I'm almost at 100%.<eos> I hope you don't want it back.<eos> I, whipped up a batch of K'rkzar's tonic for you.
Do you hear what they're saying, dude?<eos> - You need to calm down.<eos> - I cannot calm down!<eos> You have gone from National City's golden boy to Public Enemy Number One in a matter of hours!<eos> Okay. Everything we've built is coming down, man.<eos> Just keep your voice down.<eos> Take a breath.<eos> - Now. Okay? - Okay.<eos> First and foremost, and most importantly, I didn't kill that guy.<eos> Dude. They've got you on tape.
K'hym.<eos> T'ania.<eos> Like they're in the room with me.<eos> Maybe this has something to do with M'gann.<eos> When I got to Earth, I saw my parents everywhere.<eos> I was in my room one night, I remember looking up at the stars and feeling so alone.<eos> I started to cry. And Eliza came in my room.<eos> And I yelled at her to get out.<eos> Yelled?<eos> It's hard to imagine you as a teenager.
NCPD has Guardian pinned down near the wharf.<eos> They just called for backup.<eos> Let's get this guy once and for all.<eos> - Hello, Kryptonian.<eos> - Cadmus.<eos> Got it in one.<eos> And do you know why we call ourselves that?<eos> Cadmus was the very first Greek hero.<eos> If you think you're a hero, you're crazier than I thought.<eos> I'm inviting you over.

The bars are made from Nth metal from Thanagar.<eos> They're unbreakable.<eos> So, what is this place?<eos> Who are these people?<eos> It's called Cadmus.<eos> It's run by scientists who want to wipe aliens off the face of the planet.<eos> News just gets better by the second.<eos> So what?<eos> I'm the, the lucky first contestant?<eos> No... No, they kidnapped you to get to me.
No! I'm not leaving you.<eos> I'm not losing you again.<eos> Kara, I'll be fine.<eos> Please. Just go.<eos> I'll slow them down.<eos> I've been here 15 years, I'll survive a little longer.<eos> If I leave you here, Alex will never forgive me.<eos> Kara, if you die here, there will be no one to forgive.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
Yes! Comfort food!<eos> You guys survived Cadmus, the least we could do is get you pizza and pot stickers.<eos> I'm sorry they're cold.<eos> That's okay.<eos> - Not anymore.<eos> - Yeah! She got her powers back.<eos> Guardian has been cleared of all charges and hailed as a hero for assisting in the arrest of serial killer Phillip Karnowsky.<eos> All right. I admit it.<eos> I was wrong about Guardian.<eos> I'm really glad he was there to help you, Alex.
Previously on Supergirl...<eos> My blood is turning you into a White Martian.<eos> You're Hank Henshaw.<eos> The real Hank Henshaw.<eos> Hank Henshaw is dead.<eos> I'm Cyborg Superman.<eos> - What did they do to you?
Oh, boy.<eos> - Ooh! Mmm-mmm. - No, please.<eos> So...<eos> You really hit it off with Mon-El.<eos> Oh, Kara. He's chatting me up because I'm your mother.<eos> - What?<eos> - He likes you!<eos> - Uh, no. No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> He's trying to score points with me to impress you.
I knew it was you in that weird space portal thing!<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry. It took a couple of tries to get here.<eos> This is my friend, Cisco.<eos> Well, friend is a loose term.<eos> We work together.<eos> - Hi. Cisco.<eos> - Hi. I have to say it, this is a nice universe you got here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, do you remember last year, when I helped you out and you promised to do the same for me?
I just know that you can't stay here.<eos> - We'll tell Raimy that I...<eos> - You gotta listen to me.<eos> I need you to see the bigger picture here.<eos> I think I am.<eos> Your life is in immediate danger right now.<eos> This Nightingale, he is gonna come,<eos> - and he is gonna take you.<eos> - You need to stop saying that.<eos> Frankie, what the hell happened to you?
So, what are we stealing?<eos> Nothing much.<eos> Just the most powerful magic in all the realm.<eos> A weapon known as the Diamond in the Rough.<eos> Right.<eos> Emma, I really don't think chasing a bird is an effective form of therapy.<eos> Last time, he took me to the Oracle.<eos> He'll do it again.<eos> She knows what's going on with my visions.<eos> She says she knows, but I can actually help you.
Who would do this?<eos> Stop!<eos> Hey! Hey, stop!<eos> I guess Shirin was after more than just a fulfilling career in education.<eos> If that's even her real name.<eos> Let's go find out.<eos> So, let's talk.<eos> Who are you really, Shirin?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Let us help you.
That man needed to get away from that blithering bookworm.<eos> Have you and the Dark One ever...<eos> Have you?<eos> God, no.<eos> But I did try once.<eos> Back in my wicked days.<eos> You know those days don't have to be over.<eos> So, what's holding you back now, hmm?<eos> I mean, isn't this what you've always wanted?<eos> A family who gets you, who chooses you?
Kid.<eos> I said I wanted to be alone.<eos> I know.<eos> But...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> What?<eos> This is all my fault.<eos> What... what are you saying?<eos> If I never knocked on your door, If I never dragged you to Storybrooke in the first place, none of this would be happening.<eos> I forced you to become the Savior.
I know, it's crazy.<eos> There was a public campaign...<eos> That's amazing.<eos> That is amazing!<eos> Yeah.<eos> It is, thanks, I'm excited.<eos> Um... but it also means I have a lot to do that I hadn't planned on, so... So less time for me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - So what's the plan for tomorrow?<eos> - Um... tomorrow, I've got a lot of MLB stuff during the day, so Eliot's gonna take you all around the city, show you around.
- Um... tomorrow, I've got a lot of MLB stuff during the day, so Eliot's gonna take you all around the city, show you around.<eos> There's a ton of stuff to do here, there's LEGOLAND, and...<eos> - Uh, the zoo...<eos> - The zoo.<eos> And then tomorrow night, we'll get dinner together.<eos> Certainly... looking forward to getting to spend some time with Eliot.<eos> Hmm, me, too.<eos> Well, I probably should just go on ahead and get unpacked.<eos> Mom, I didn't... I didn't, um...<eos> I didn't plan this to avoid spending time with you.
I've sat through 0 for 4s and slumps and benchings.<eos> There's almost a year of our marriage MIA for all of the road trips, and I've never complained.<eos> Not once.<eos> I recap every game, every moment of your life every night... and it's the highlight of my day.<eos> I raise your sons when you're gone.<eos> I keep your home while you're away, and I'm ready to uproot our lives if another old man decides on a whim he wants you more than the one who currently pays you.<eos> So perhaps you will allow me one single moment of disappointment upon learning our family vacation was just ruined with a phone call.<eos> The boys and I will watch the game from here.<eos> I'll take them to the theme park all by myself like I do all the time in San Diego.<eos> And we'll see you back there in a few days.
I'll see you out in the yard.<eos> I'm sorry, Mom.<eos> You don't have to apologize to me.<eos> I understand.<eos> Just know this:<eos> If you change your mind, or if it ever just gets to be too much for you one day and you need me to step in,<eos> I'll do it.<eos> I'll be right here waiting.<eos> I love you.<eos> And there is nothing that you can ever do to make me stop loving you.
Oh, you're welcome. I'll get them, I'll get them to you.<eos> - I'll leave them for you.<eos> A pleasure.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> All right.<eos> Good night.<eos> I was right.<eos> That was... that was fun.<eos> We need to be more careful.<eos> I didn't invite you.
This is Oscar Arguella of the San Diego Padres.<eos> - Thank you. - Mm-hmm.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Please, no Spanish.<eos> It's too obvious, papi.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> You know how I knew you were gonna catch that?<eos> 'Cause I know that's what you used for a ball as a kid.<eos> Just like I did. 'Cause neither of us could afford a real one.<eos> I know what the Yankees are offering you, and I can't match it.
I just don't understand.<eos> Now I can't even get three hours with you.<eos> Losing your father... was incredibly painful.<eos> But it happened a long time before he died.<eos> Losing you... The most painful thing that ever happened to me.<eos> Why did you shut me out?<eos> I never made you choose.<eos> Why?<eos> Why?<eos> I love you, and there is nothing that you can ever do to make me stop loving you.
I wasn't talking about you.<eos> I was talking about the other female major-leaguer.<eos> How you doing with the whole Mom-Kevin thing?<eos> All good.<eos> How are you doing with the whole catcher coming to take your job thing?<eos> I heard he starts in El Paso next week.<eos> All good.<eos> You still there?<eos> Yeah, I'm still here.<eos> Sorry, I-I just thought I lost you for a sec, but it must have been from when that home run bounced off my satellite provider.
Having my wife fall in love with me again.<eos> Well, we've won eight out of 11.<eos> And don't knock kale, it keeps me regular.<eos> You and Rachel, I can't help you there.<eos> We both have needs, Mike.<eos> And we both want to get to the promised land someday.<eos> And we both might get there faster if... you left.<eos> To be clear, I want you staying put.<eos> I need your bat, and no one can handle a pitching staff like you; but above everything else,<eos> I want you in my clubhouse. A contender will give up a decent prospect to have you in their lineup.
All right. - All right.<eos> Let's do this. - Let's see what we have here.<eos> - So, how are the twins?<eos> - Growing.<eos> - They're almost eight.<eos> - Eight?<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Get ready to double the torture.<eos> Oh, can't wait.<eos> So, what finally brings you to San Diego?
I'm sorry?<eos> Will came to see me after my first game and you sent him away?<eos> I did.<eos> Gin, he was in really bad shape.<eos> And you didn't tell me?<eos> Because something bigger than both of us was happening, and I couldn't let him jeopardize that.<eos> And I'd do it again.<eos> I don't want to have to choose between you and my brother.<eos> I had to do that once, I chose him.<eos> He's the one who chose you.
Man, I've been under for two years.<eos> Maybe I'm starting to think like a bad guy.<eos> No, I know what this is.<eos> It's like Wroblicki on his first day as a detective.<eos> He's coming out of the deli with a sandwich when, bam, nearly gets knocked on his ass by some guy tearing down the street.<eos> Wro chases the guy down, tackles him.<eos> Turns out he knifed some mope a block away.<eos> It's beginner's luck.<eos> Hey, what do you think about Goff as the Nightingale?<eos> If he is, we got to catch him by the letter, and I don't know what ugly habits those narcos taught you, but that's it for busting into sheds without probable cause.
- Yes, we do.<eos> All right. Um...<eos> Okay, kiddo...<eos> I got to, um...<eos> I gotta go out for just a little bit, okay?<eos> - I'm going too.<eos> - Ah, no, no, no.<eos> See, we got to chase a bad guy.<eos> But what about the movie?<eos> I tell you what, tomorrow I'm gonna take you to a double feature.
- That's exactly what I meant.<eos> Um... look, if you need any help...<eos> Pass.<eos> I can make people like me on my own just fine.<eos> - Yeah? - I just wanted to say...<eos> - Mm-hmm. That story really is awful.<eos> I'd tighten it up.<eos> Add a couple jokes.<eos> Thank you for the feedback.<eos> This website says we have an hour to get you and the thumb to the hospital.
Kermit's been playing his heart out, and you've had your face buried in that phone.<eos> Don't need my eyes to enjoy the music.<eos> It's an aural experience.<eos> But no gaming on date night.<eos> That's the agreement, remember?<eos> It's not just a game.<eos> Plus, I'm so close to the next level.<eos> Not if you keep playing, you're not.<eos> Is it strange that your bossing me around turns me on?<eos> You're a guy-- everything turns you on.
A frozen TV dinner factory.<eos> Appropriate, as you'll all soon be put on ice in Gotham State Penitentiary.<eos> Show yourselves.<eos> Oh, stop me if you've heard this one, Batman.<eos> Why don't eggs tell jokes?<eos> Because they crack each other up.<eos> You need new material.<eos> Fools!<eos> Get them.<eos> One last time, Catwoman, I implore you to turn yourself in without a fight.
Um... tell her it's like the boiler room down here.<eos> - You remember?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Where she found Liam's decoy bomb after Grand Central.<eos> A fake threat luring us into real danger.<eos> Exactly.<eos> But, without Ryan, I'm scared.<eos> Find Lydia Hall.<eos> We don't get along, but she's very good at what she does.<eos> She'll get you through this, okay?
How?<eos> What test showed them that?<eos> Well, the CIA made me think that a very dangerous man had escaped and was after me.<eos> And they knew that fear of mine, too.<eos> Hey, maybe after we get out of here, we'll be able to look at people and find their weaknesses like they do.<eos> What if you don't want that?<eos> Doesn't it seem awful to know everything about everyone?<eos> To see their pain?<eos> Isn't it worse not to see it?<eos> What did they trick you with?
It's probably easier than working with my father.<eos> Round three?<eos> What you said in class hit me.<eos> - I don't doubt it.<eos> - Cute.<eos> I knew throwing you at the bottom of the Murder Board would make you spin out.<eos> Do I belong here?<eos> In your mind?<eos> Simple question, really.<eos> I was the one who recruited you here.
Actually, you can start with this junk food you call breakfast.<eos> You're not really gonna eat this rubbish, are you?<eos> My Pop Tarts!<eos> Hurry back, and I'll make us a pirate's breakfast of grapefruit and boiled mackerel.<eos> There'll be no scurvy here today.<eos> I know what you're thinking...<eos> "How long before that pirate ruins everything?"<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Looking out for my son.<eos> Tell me... is your new father bothering you?
So now you have to ask yourself one tiny question... what are you going to do about it?<eos> Really?<eos> Emma, this is not what it looks like.<eos> - This is my new car.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> So you traded in your flying carpet for a Miata?<eos> - Yeah, it gets great mileage.<eos> - Sure, right.<eos> Let's take a drive.<eos> We need to talk. Jasmine sent you.
You know what?<eos> I'm gonna head back to the station, see if anyone reported him missing.<eos> Yeah, uh... I'll stay here. I'll let you know how it goes.<eos> Belle!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Snow, hi.<eos> I'm... getting my first ultrasound.<eos> Wow! That's so exciting.<eos> Yeah, didn't even tell Rumple I was coming.<eos> Well, given what he's put you through, I don't think anyone would blame you.
Why?<eos> What's he ever done for you?<eos> When I was a child, my family was taken from me.<eos> I grew up next to the docks, fending for myself, desperate to make the people who took them pay.<eos> It was only a matter of time before I got myself killed.<eos> And then what?<eos> Nemo kidnapped you?<eos> That man saved my life.<eos> Let me ask you one question.<eos> Your quest for vengeance... did you ever find those who wronged you?
I just wish Nemo could see that we finally made peace.<eos> Well, maybe he can.<eos> They found him this morning.<eos> Nemo.<eos> Liam.<eos> How's Liam?<eos> Is he okay?<eos> Aye, lad. He is now.<eos> I feel like I'm still missing a huge part of the story here.<eos> Your kid brother has a submarine, and he kidnapped you.
Some perverted SOB stole my Sophie doll.<eos> I realized that it's okay not to watch baby Barbara for 24-8.<eos> You know, in Poland, we get the extra day.<eos> For dredging the lakes.<eos> Why don't you go get us a table, Sophie?<eos> Any chance of getting that doll back?<eos> I really underestimated how strong my feelings for it were.<eos> I know.<eos> I was the one who walked in on you brushing her hair.<eos> And I was the one who asked you not to repeat that.
You were great, but your "one for them, one for me" policy got a little topless.<eos> You enjoyed the tips, didn't you?<eos> I said "Tips."<eos> Excuse me, excuse me.<eos> Haven't you seen a stroller in a bar before?<eos> Hey, girls.<eos> What, you're not even gonna say hello, 'cause I look like garbage?<eos> You didn't even give us a chance, Sophie.<eos> You were too busy running over all of our customers.<eos> Well, I'm sorry if I'm embarrassing you with the way I look, Caroline.
No, Max, look!<eos> Is that tree new or has it always been there?<eos> I know the condom stuck to it hasn't.<eos> The diner is fine, but our beautiful dessert bar gets hit by the hurricane?<eos> But... your hair looks good right now.<eos> Just "good"?<eos> I'm calling Han.<eos> I weirdly feel like I need him now.<eos> It's going straight to voicemail.<eos> Han! I was just trying to call you.
- Yes.<eos> Psst. You know they're only seven right?<eos> - And a half.<eos> - It's your turn to set the table.<eos> - Again?<eos> - Oh, yeah! Yeah.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> - You're not gonna help?<eos> - Help?<eos> I got you in here, didn't I?
And after a few years, thanks to collective bargaining, they can become free agents.<eos> And then they can decide to uproot their families for boatloads of money themselves.<eos> That's how it works.<eos> - But the fans...<eos> - Oh, you're gonna tell me what the fans want?<eos> I know what they want.<eos> Same thing as the owners.<eos> They want to win.<eos> Same as your teammates.<eos> Because they would trade you, and their best friend if it meant a ring for them.
- No, I can't.<eos> - What is it that you don't want?<eos> To jump or to be caught?<eos> Well...<eos> Come on. Let's go.<eos> Alexis!<eos> Go Brigitte!<eos> Brigitte!<eos> Brigitte!<eos> Nobody would have caught you in school.
Can you confirm what you told me?<eos> The suicide mail was sent from Catherine's computer.<eos> Thank you, Pedro.<eos> Alexis will take over her job so she can leave right away.<eos> Of course, Rémi.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sorry, Catherine.<eos> I hadn't realized anything.<eos> I hope you'll get back on your feet.<eos> What did I do to you, Rémi?
Bravo!<eos> Making fun of physical aspects!<eos> She doesn't hear me.<eos> No, for sure.<eos> It doesn't hurt anyone.<eos> But does it do any good to anyone?<eos> I've been polite to you all.<eos> You're the number 2, no need to pretend anymore.<eos> Alexis!<eos> Run, your boss calls you.
I figured you weren't dating anybody else seriously, because you weren't over Rachel yet.<eos> I'm still in love with you.<eos> You only want me because you can't have me.<eos> I got hacked.<eos> Selfies that we took from the road.<eos> The selfies hacked from Trevor's computer have surfaced.<eos> - Pictures are being released.<eos> - What else you got?<eos> I can give you a home.<eos> And I promise you, that San Diego will embrace you as one of their own.
I have to go tell the front office.<eos> They're already upset with me after L.A.<eos> I know.<eos> They need to know.<eos> They need to know today.<eos> Hey, it's too bad about you and Mike.<eos> I'm sorry if I was the reason it didn't work out.<eos> Mike Lawson has some stuff that he needs to work through.<eos> You pushed me out of the way of a speeding bullet.<eos> Now it's my turn to help you.
I'm not punishing you.<eos> Well, on that mound is the only place that feels normal.<eos> Turn that off.<eos> Been working on a cutter.<eos> You want to see it?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.<eos> You're done.<eos> Now, go get showered and dressed.<eos> I'm taking you out.
- He's new.<eos> He'll learn. - Yeah.<eos> As soon as the guy who signed him makes him play by the same rules<eos> - as everyone else.<eos> - Oh, you think he's afraid of me?<eos> Do you think he's afraid of anybody else in this clubhouse?<eos> I can think of a good way to find out.<eos> I'll tell you what he's afraid of.<eos> A pair of bright shining lights, ten miles from the shore.<eos> Because when you see those lights out there from your leaky boat, Coast Guard's gonna nab you, and send you straight back to Cuba.
I'll be right there.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Everything's okay.<eos> It's okay, but she can't breathe?<eos> She's just... having a panic attack.<eos> Got it handled.<eos> I'm just tired.<eos> Tired, but I can't sleep, you know?<eos> I know it well.<eos> What's keeping you up?
All right.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> This is my friend, Ginny.<eos> No way.<eos> You're Ginny Baker.<eos> That's what I hear.<eos> Weird.<eos> It's L.A.<eos> You didn't finish your coffee.<eos> And since you're not into ambitious cocktailing, maybe I could take you out for a, uh, slow-pour, six dollar cup of coffee?
Look, you mean a lot to the Padres, and more than just dollars and cents.<eos> So, for starters, I've called a psychiatrist, who specializes in high pressure situations that you can speak with.<eos> Guys, I appreciate the concern.<eos> But, really, I'm fine.<eos> No.<eos> You're not.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> I'll talk to your, um... your shrink, or whatever.<eos> Good.<eos> She's waiting for you in my office.
- No. Because you two are acting like a couple of little boys here.<eos> Dad, you complain that Oscar doesn't have your back anymore, but when we're together, he tells me that you're the reason the team held it together when Ginny arrived.<eos> And you.<eos> You think that my dad is defying you out of spite, but, deep down, you know he's right about Mike Lawson.<eos> And since I have you both here together, I might as well tell you that I am not taking the job at the hospital.<eos> I'm volunteering for International Medical Corps.<eos> "International"?<eos> That sounds far away.<eos> And when I'm gone, maybe... you'll both learn to stop talking to me and start... talking to each other.<eos> I'll call you tomorrow.
That's how you're dealing with it?<eos> What about you, Alicia?<eos> How do you deal with it?<eos> You know what I'm talking about, don't you?<eos> Sienna, your daughter.<eos> You send her to Quantico, speak at her graduation, get her a job as a profiler, and she ends up dead at the hands of a serial killer.<eos> You think you're safe behind there!<eos> You think you're safe!<eos> You are not safe from me!<eos> I am gonna get you!
Didn't your baby room have a theme?<eos> Well, it doubled as my dad's office, and he was a cop, so I guess the theme was bloody homicide photos.<eos> Oh. Mine was Winnie the Pooh.<eos> But anyway... why don't we just take a step back and start with a color?<eos> Right? There are so many amazing ones.<eos> Red, blue, green, purple...<eos> Are you just gonna name all the colors?<eos> Well, not now.<eos> I don't care what color the room is.<eos> Okay, well, I'm just trying to help you.
Assuming we get cleared for the shootings.<eos> What's Avery say?<eos> Should be fine.<eos> What was I supposed to do?<eos> My partner handcuffs me to his trailer, and then I drive a truck through the wall of...<eos> You didn't tell me that part.<eos> What part?<eos> Handcuff you to his trailer part.<eos> Oh, I meant he handcuffed the suspect...<eos> Handcuffed you to his trailer.
- Hello?<eos> - Three hours late!<eos> No phone call?<eos> No excuses?<eos> You know what? For as long as you are breathing, I don't want to hear it.<eos> And I also want you to know that I am hurt, and I'm man enough to say it.<eos> Oh, you don't have nothing to say?<eos> Nothing to say for yourself?<eos> I miss you, too, Rog.<eos> I invite you into my home to break bread with my family.
- No, you're surf.<eos> You live on the beach, butt naked.<eos> This is non-negotiable, Roger.<eos> Pineapple and ham.<eos> That's gross. I don't want to be either.<eos> Chips and salsa.<eos> Okay, I can roll with that.<eos> Okay. I'm spicy salsa with the tomatoes blended nicely on the side.<eos> You'd be mild and chunky at best.<eos> You know, I'm trying to like you.
Date night... tonight.<eos> I'll move some things around.<eos> Okay, if it's not that important.<eos> It's work.<eos> This... this is important.<eos> Hey, look who's here.<eos> Oh, gosh.<eos> Invite him in.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
And, our children are the life preservers.<eos> Is that right?<eos> No...<eos> Damn it, I can't read my own writing.<eos> No, it's-it's lovely, honey.<eos> Keep going.<eos> No. You know what?<eos> Forget about the notes.<eos> Okay.<eos> I love you more each day.
- My thoughts.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Okay. I'll tell, uh, a waiter we're leaving?<eos> Oh, no, no. You're leaving.<eos> I have a bottle of wine...<eos> and a babysitter.<eos> I respect that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> Mm. Love you.
- Okay.<eos> Okay. I'll tell, uh, a waiter we're leaving?<eos> Oh, no, no. You're leaving.<eos> I have a bottle of wine...<eos> and a babysitter.<eos> I respect that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> Mm. Love you.<eos> I love you, too.
What a trip!<eos> Yo, your mama used to make the best brownies...<eos> Wait, hold on. Is your daddy still a, uh... A cop?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You selling bootleg DVDs?<eos> I'm disappointed.<eos> Mainly in your collection.<eos> What you got, Surf Ninjas?<eos> Soul Plane?<eos> I ought to arrest you... for bad taste.
Hey, Bailey, why don't you run a search on all burglaries in L.A. County, see if any similarities pop up.<eos> On it.<eos> And, Murtaugh, don't be all in my grill.<eos> It's gonna take me a couple days to get all these files from around the city.<eos> Or I could get them in an hour.<eos> Gang Unit has contacts in all stations.<eos> I'll hook you up.<eos> Team, I'm sure you remember Detective Cruz.<eos> Remarkably, after working with Riggs and Murtaugh on our last cartel case, he put in to be transferred over to us full-time.<eos> Good to have you, Cruz.
I work for the dealership.<eos> One of the perks is getting to drive an $80,000 car.<eos> I wouldn't be able to afford it otherwise.<eos> Well, you drive safely.<eos> It's like cracking a case.<eos> What's like cracking a case?<eos> Figuring out what a girl wants to hear so they let you... you know, g-get with them.<eos> You know, this was like a... a serious, X-rated-type situation.<eos> She was like, "Mmm," and then I was like, "Mmm,"<eos> and then she was like, "I love you, RJ."
Stand down.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> If Jackson thinks we're here to arrest him, he will kill us.<eos> We are here to arrest him.<eos> All right, well, let that be our little secret.<eos> Go that way.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Hey, Jackson!<eos> Sorry to barge in unannounced.<eos> Look, I'm not here to arrest you.
So, who we going to talk to?<eos> Rodrigo Salazar.<eos> He's an explosive expert.<eos> I think he could help us.<eos> How do you know him?<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Just follow me.<eos> Mind waiting outside?<eos> I like the change of scenery, but there's no chance I'm gonna help the cops.<eos> You don't think helping us out will help you out?
Detectives, please do something.<eos> - He's going kill...<eos> - Stop talking.<eos> I'm not leaving, so, you wanna take them out, you're gonna have my blood on your hands, too.<eos> Mine, too.<eos> You tried to kill me twice, so I'm sure it doesn't have the same impact, but we're in this together.<eos> You won.<eos> All right?<eos> You proved your point.<eos> And you promised me I could take you in after your mission was done.
Hey man, I just<eos> - want to say that, um...<eos> - No, don't.<eos> All right?<eos> All right?<eos> You ain't got to, man.<eos> I...<eos> Do me a favor, though.<eos> Trust her like you trusted me, yeah?<eos> Oh, she help you out too?
Is that why you became a cop after the military... to chase the action?<eos> It's different over there, man.<eos> Constant intensity.<eos> Firefights, roadside bombs.<eos> It's all the time, man.<eos> You come back here, and... everything that was familiar is now foreign.<eos> People you've known your whole life are strangers, you know?<eos> You...<eos> Feels like you're turned upside down.<eos> So, what got you through it?
He's terrible after his second martini.<eos> Even worse after his third.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey. You see that guy up there in the dark glasses?<eos> That's Sam Giancana.<eos> He's the biggest mobster in the country.<eos> He worked with both the CIA and JFK to try and assassinate Fidel Castro.<eos> Let's just find Flynn.<eos> Anthony.<eos> I can't believe I found you.
If I had a nickel every time a guy told me that...<eos> He's coming.<eos> Are you sure there's no Christy Pitt here?<eos> Got this bottle of champagne I'm supposed to deliver to her.<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> No one by that name.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm not just gonna stand here and do nothing.<eos> - What took you so long?
You know, you used to know how to blow off some steam and bring a guy home every now and then.<eos> Please stop talking.<eos> But now, you're kind of a loser.<eos> No offense, nerds.<eos> All right, take care of yourself.<eos> - Okay, it's time to go home.<eos> - Time to go home.<eos> Wait.<eos> Take this.<eos> I set up a Tinder account for you.
You mentioned the scar on his hand several times now, Eva.<eos> Do you want to tell me how you saw it?<eos> I guess it was hard to miss.<eos> - So he wasn't wearing gloves?<eos> - No, he had gloves.<eos> But he must have taken them off at some point, right?<eos> I mean, in order for you to see the scar.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He wore them sometimes.<eos> The only prints CSU found at the scene belonged to you, Eva.
I don't know.<eos> She bought the supplies at a hardware store in Red Hook; holed up in that factory for three days starving herself.<eos> - You're kidding me.<eos> - She wanted the attention.<eos> That's what she said.<eos> Her book flopped, and it didn't get her on the news, and she wanted to matter again like she did when she was little, and I fell for it.<eos> - I wasted all of that time...<eos> - Okay, now hold on.<eos> Raims, she knows something.<eos> All right, when you guys were kids, she told you that she saw the guy that took her mother.
Yes.<eos> Jules, you are.<eos> Okay, it's me and every other nurse in this city.<eos> Look. I carpool to work.<eos> I-I don't go out alone.<eos> - I'm taking precautions, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> And I will even look out for this blue truck, but I do not want Raimy knowing anything about this.<eos> Okay.<eos> You still have that gun that I gave you in the closet?
The ever-returning eye crud.<eos> [Ugga] And of course, The Crush.<eos> [Eep] Wow! Does every boy that causes The Crush look like Kevin?<eos> They tend to be a certain type, yeah.<eos> [sighs] Everything I'm feeling is here.<eos> I have no appetite, I can't focus.<eos> [sighs] At least I'm not hallucinating.<eos> [with Spanish accent] Think again, my love.<eos> Pig rats, I'm doomed.<eos> No, we'll get you through this, Eep.
Who are they? It'd be great to meet their parents.<eos> Uh, they don't have parents.<eos> Nailed it.<eos> [sniffing] Sandy, be cool.<eos> - Whoa, whoa, down, girl, down.<eos> - No, Thunk! No, no, heel!<eos> She started it.<eos> Maybe, but we expect her to attack people, she's a baby.<eos> You...<eos> What's gotten into you, Thunk?
[sniffing] Sandy, be cool.<eos> - Whoa, whoa, down, girl, down.<eos> - No, Thunk! No, no, heel!<eos> She started it.<eos> Maybe, but we expect her to attack people, she's a baby.<eos> You...<eos> What's gotten into you, Thunk?<eos> [sniffs] He's been hanging out with liyotes!<eos> [sniffs, gasps] Smell it ain't so, Thunk.<eos> Young man, what have I always told you?
No, after you.<eos> You two seem tense.<eos> What you need is a nice, relaxing recline.<eos> [whispering] Hey, don't overdo it. Just be cool.<eos> Just play it cool.<eos> [Thunk] Eep, are you gone or are your eyes just closed?<eos> A-ha!<eos> Caught you egg-handed!<eos> I caught you!<eos> You only caught me coming here to stop you.
Hugs are traps.<eos> They pin your arms.<eos> Right.<eos> No hugs.<eos> - Smiling is dangerous.<eos> - Darn right.<eos> The sun's too hot, the flowers are too smelly, and that pigrat's too ugly.<eos> [cooing] Hmm. Too sensitive, too.<eos> Uh-huh. Well, have fun hating everything.<eos> We'll be over here ignoring you.
Am I gonna touch it? I might touch it.<eos> I am gonna touch it.<eos> I just might... - [back cracking] - [grunts]<eos> I think I just...<eos> - [back cracking] - Yeah, yeah.<eos> I definitely threw my back out.<eos> That's a bear owl, isn't it?<eos> Okay, yes.<eos> Hi.<eos> Can I interest you in that sleeping ramu right over...
The race about to start, and Never Been Bitten running in it.<eos> Never Been Bitten!<eos> The fastest winged cheetah alive.<eos> [groaning] - Darn family and their chores!<eos> - You have a family?<eos> Are they real or a tooth one like mine?<eos> This is my sister, my brother, my uncle, and my cousin Linus.<eos> Uh, yeah, nice to meet you, but no, my family are people.<eos> If only there were another me to do all this work.<eos> Wish I could help you, pal.
Death isn't funny.<eos> I for one agree.<eos> Thunk, maybe I don't know jokes, but I know you, and you are a lot funnier than that jerk skull.<eos> - [all laughing] - [Eep] Funk, you're hilarious.<eos> You are Funk Rood, right?<eos> [sighs] I am and I'm not.<eos> But yeah, I got into this to make people laugh, at me.<eos> And that's what I'm going to do.<eos> Hey, Ugga, you gotta see Funk's impression of you at the Laughing Pit.<eos> [chuckling] Oh, man, he's got you down.
That other male's trying to jerk them apart.<eos> Well, sure, sweetie.<eos> Every species has jerks.<eos> [chuckles] Beat it, jerkalippo.<eos> Looks like love wins again.<eos> - Kevin?<eos> You watch animal courtships?<eos> Yeah, but I think of it as watching two hearts become one.<eos> Isn't nature so beautiful?<eos> But the reason I'm here now is to ask you out to a romantic sunset dinner, Eep.
Guys, what are you doing?<eos> That was going to be our dinner!<eos> And my new head hair.<eos> She just fell in love!<eos> And I'm not letting you crush her dreams, Dad!<eos> We're not trying to crush her dreams, just her entire body!<eos> Buffalippos have dreams?<eos> I wonder if they're the same as mine.<eos> That's it. Run, girl!<eos> No one can stop you from reaching your one and only. [panting]
I guess that's all you were trying to do for me, weren't you, Dad?<eos> Help!<eos> Hey, don't throw that rock, Munk.<eos> You might hit Eep.<eos> No, don't throw that rock, either.<eos> I've got a better idea.<eos> Loverboy!<eos> Graze this field often?<eos> Dad? I don't think he's into you.<eos> But he's definitely on to you.
[sighs] Cave brain.<eos> Thunk, I am so sorry.<eos> [nervous chuckle] It's okay.<eos> And, hey, I'm not scared of the storm anymore.<eos> - [chickuna clucking]<eos> Actually, no.<eos> [screaming] [grunting] Ha! Control the weather?<eos> [laughs] Gran can barely control when she has to go...<eos> Pee-ople are trying to kill me!<eos> Well, well. If only your perfect daughter had told you this was gonna...
The doctors say it is unlikely he will recover.<eos> Until the Party meets and selects his successor, the Führer had ordered that I be named acting chancellor.<eos> Trust me, it's not an honor anyone would want, Josef.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You see, this has happened before.<eos> Once the Führer was unwell, and for a time it was thought as he would die, so Reichsmarshall Göring declared himself acting chancellor.<eos> I never heard about that.<eos> That's because Hitler had Göring shot, along with his entire family.<eos> This is different, right?<eos> - He chose you. - Yes.
He must have another idea for you.<eos> I've got to get out of here.<eos> Listen, Juliana, we're hearing whispers.<eos> The S.S. is on alert.<eos> They're securing key locations around the city.<eos> They're nervous about something.<eos> And then Smith chooses today to show you his hand?<eos> We need to know what is going on.<eos> Don't.<eos> He told you to go about your day, right?
No, she's lying to you, Arnold.<eos> She's been lying...<eos> It did not come from her, Frank.<eos> It came from an old war buddy of mine and the kind of guy who would give up his life for you.<eos> He wouldn't lie.<eos> And did he know about your day job?<eos> All right.<eos> [Scoff] Frank, that's fair.<eos> I wouldn't expect you to understand what I did for my family, but do not call my daughter a liar.<eos> She never betrayed you.
Because I've been there.<eos> A couple of months ago, I had a, a sit-down with Yao Fat.<eos> And now,<eos> I'm realizing that Doris must have orchestrated that meeting so she could follow me out there and learn the location of the site.<eos> She used me.<eos> We got to do something.<eos> We got to figure a way to get her out of there.<eos> No way.<eos> Steve.<eos> I know... she has hurt you. okay, but whatever she's done, Steve, she is still your mother.
No, how did you know?<eos> 'Cause you did it exactly the same way you did it all those years before when you left me and Dad and Mary.<eos> Exactly the same way.<eos> Bye, mom.<eos> Bye.<eos> Steven, wait!<eos> What?<eos> Nothing, just... come here.<eos> I love you and I'm so proud of you.<eos> I love you, too, Mom.
Mom.<eos> I'm not going.<eos> You're impossible. Impossible.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> What are you still doing here?<eos> I thought you were gonna rotate out.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Who sent you?<eos> - What's that?<eos> - I said who sent you?
Cover him, Ma, cover him.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I got no zip ties.<eos> What, seriously?<eos> You didn't bring restraints and you've been on how many ops now?<eos> You know what, Ma?<eos> I thought I was coming in, getting you and getting out, okay?<eos> I didn't think<eos> I was gonna be tying up bad guys, all right?<eos> Who raised you?
I just need you to undstand.<eos> We used to talk.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> So talk to me.<eos> Maybe I can help you.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Mom, please, all right?<eos> Because from where I am standing, you're throwing away everything you've ever worked for, and for what?<eos> Lucy, I raised you better than that.<eos> I raised you to use your head, and that Lucy has her whole life planned out.
You are the one that I trust.<eos> Rufus needs you.<eos> I need you.<eos> Okay?<eos> Get ready to run.<eos> Okay.<eos> Just stay low.<eos> It goes straight to the river.<eos> Keep your head down.<eos> What took you so long?
Got you back in the monkey suit already, do they?<eos> - Oh.<eos> - Monkey suit?<eos> I'm-I'm so sorry.<eos> I thought you were Agent Gregorio.<eos> Oh.<eos> And you are...?<eos> Special Agent Dwayne Pride,<eos> NCIS. Hey.<eos> He's the one I told you about.
I'm Hannah Lee. I'm with the U.S. attorney's office.<eos> I.E., don't piss her off.<eos> We flew down here yesterday together from D.C.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Helping out with the Javier Garcia investigation?<eos> Hoping to build a case against him, so I can petition the grand jury for an indictment.<eos> Cut the snake off at the head and get the cartel out of NOLA once and for all.<eos> They don't call it NOLA down here.<eos> They prefer New Orleans.<eos> Oh, glad to see we made an impression on you, Gregorio.
Oh, it's like he never slowed down.<eos> And the only silver lining is the death is likely instantaneous.<eos> He didn't suffer.<eos> Possible he had a medical condition?<eos> Heart attack?<eos> Stroke?<eos> He's awfully young.<eos> But I'll know more after the autopsy, and I'll do a tox screen for drugs and alcohol.<eos> Hey, boss.<eos> Oh, wait, nobody calls you "boss," do they?
Look, don't worry about me, King.<eos> All right?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Let's just get back to work.<eos> Sorry to interrupt, but we just got a lead on the stolen money.<eos> Yeah, I'm on it.<eos> I don't see anything.<eos> Where's the lead?<eos> Well, it's actually not my lead, so...<eos> Took you long enough, Percy.
Oh, a little birdie might've told him.<eos> What?<eos> Look, Melody... you don't have to worry about him anymore, I promise.<eos> Why, what are you gonna do?<eos> What needs to be done.<eos> All right, you stay here.<eos> You put Tucker in the car.<eos> I'll be right back, all right?<eos> What's going on, huh?<eos> They're arresting you, Darrell.
I don't know what to do.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For covering for me with Shepherd.<eos> Forget it.<eos> You've been through a lot.<eos> Now, it's gonna take some time.<eos> But I can't keep Shepherd at bay forever.<eos> You need to find your way back here.<eos> I'm working on it.<eos> Have I ever told you what happened to my rabbit?
We just have to postpone until we can get the rest.<eos> No... we need to strike while they're still playing catch-up.<eos> I'll talk to some of our other suppliers.<eos> See what we can come up with.<eos> Why did you take your sister to Lake Aurora?<eos> You're keeping tabs on me now?<eos> Stop giving me reasons to.<eos> I'm worried we're only showing her the worst of us.<eos> That's not your call to make.<eos> She's forgotten you, forgotten me, forgotten why we're doing this in the first place!
Start thinking about your baby.<eos> Okay? You're going to come with me.<eos> We have to get to the stairs.<eos> Get up.<eos> If you want the tapes, come and get 'em!<eos> Put the case down, step away.<eos> Hands in the air.<eos> Hang on, Allie.<eos> We have to keep going.<eos> What took you so long?
Now!<eos> Okay. It's time for you to embrace technology.<eos> You just got to connect to the van's Wi-Fi.<eos> We'll take it from there.<eos> This is a foreign language to me.<eos> It's just typing in a password.<eos> No...<eos> It's literally foreign.<eos> It's in Chinese.<eos> All right, Gallo, I'm pulling up a Chinese/English keyboard overlay and we will walk you through this.
It's okay to be upset.<eos> I'm not.<eos> It is okay to be upset, Happy.<eos> You know, when I was, uh, in elementary school, I was jealous of the other kids.<eos> Because their parents waited outside to take them home, and I walked to the orphanage by myself.<eos> I was looking forward to waiting outside for somebody.<eos> Ah-ta-ta-ta... Hey, come here, listen to me.<eos> We love each other.<eos> We're gonna have a family.<eos> You're gonna wait outside a school and you're gonna build a crib and you're gonna share tools with whatever baby is lucky enough to have you as their mom.
Hello, there.<eos> Oh, don't you two look pretty and domestic.<eos> What terrible things have you been up to?<eos> You look like you're having a good day.<eos> Oh, it's a perfect day.<eos> I'm finally getting my revenge on Snow White.<eos> And Prince Farming thrown in as a bonus.<eos> Soon I'll have their little shared heart beating in the palm of my hand.<eos> You seem confident.<eos> Is the Dark One helping you?
Say, which way are you headed?<eos> To Longbourn.<eos> Fate has smiled upon our heads.<eos> That's exactly where I'm headed.<eos> Perhaps we can travel together.<eos> That sounds fine.<eos> Hop on up.<eos> I'm eager to get started for the day.<eos> Do you really have to go, Princess Snow?<eos> The fairies can help you.
Previously on This Is Us...<eos> I told you that when I met you, that I couldn't fall for a fat person.<eos> But you did.<eos> So now what?<eos> You're just gonna throw me away?<eos> I'm sorry, I can't do this.<eos> Can't do what?<eos> When a nice boy who adores you offers you pie, say thank you.
I was worried about you.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> - The carpet would beg to differ. - Mm.<eos> You've been pacing for a few hours now.<eos> You ready to talk?<eos> To William.<eos> You can come in, too, William.<eos> - I know how angry you must be.<eos> - When did you meet my mother?<eos> When she took you home from the hospital.
This was supposed to be our day.<eos> What?<eos> No, I mean, you know, I told her that we were here.<eos> I didn't know she was gonna bring our playwright and some dude.<eos> This guy is wearing suspenders over a thermal.<eos> Like, what... what is that?<eos> These are my people now, Kate.<eos> He's an artist.<eos> He's authentic.<eos> I'm sorry, I love you, but I want to punch you.
That's all I've ever been.<eos> - You got it all wrong, son.<eos> - No, I've spent my life striving for perfection, and you know why, Dad?<eos> 'Cause I live in fear.<eos> That if I let up for a moment, I will remember that I am unwanted.<eos> And then what'll happen to me?<eos> Stop.<eos> Randall.<eos> Hey, you come here.<eos> The moment I saw you, I knew you were my boy.
And then what'll happen to me?<eos> Stop.<eos> Randall.<eos> Hey, you come here.<eos> The moment I saw you, I knew you were my boy.<eos> You weren't a choice, Randall, you were a fact.<eos> You were never a replacement, son.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> If I had known that the man who abandoned me regretted it... that he wanted me back... that would've made all the difference in the world.<eos> I'm sorry that she lied to you.
It's probably the weapon that killed your boyfriend.<eos> Everyone down!<eos> We got a male suspect on a motorcycle!<eos> We got a suspect, James Connor, headed to Esplanade!<eos> On a motorcycle!<eos> Black leather jacket, black motorcycle.<eos> Everybody all right?<eos> Elvis, you okay?<eos> I'm good.<eos> I'll call you later.
I never thought I would say this, but it is such a pleasure to see you, Tobias.<eos> Let's make this quick.<eos> Why rush?<eos> Seeing you miserable, and longing for information that only I can provide, is nothing short of magical.<eos> The day you abducted me, you said Happy wouldn't be able to accept my marriage proposal.<eos> You knew she had a husband.<eos> Tell me his name.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You're so desperate.<eos> She dumped you, didn't she? No.
Third lowest IQ.<eos> Yeah, if you count the waitress and the cop.<eos> Excited for your field trip, Ralph?<eos> I hear that museum has some amazing cars.<eos> Oh, you should check out the '71 AMX.<eos> It has this super fast...<eos> Happy told me everything to look for.<eos> Great.<eos> She is the expert.<eos> Well, we should leave soon because there's some political rally and traffic's already terrible, and I have to take you to LAX.
- Well, speaking of gait, why don't you use yours to refill your water bottle before the field trip?<eos> Hmm.<eos> Rhetorical question. Go.<eos> Geniuses often feel isolated, so they can be guarded when people try to get close.<eos> No.<eos> He is just a kid who loves his mom.<eos> Okay?<eos> Trust me, when I was his age,<eos> I was ten times worse to my stepdad.<eos> No, Ralph is gonna keep challenging me, and he is right to try and protect you, because you are an amazing woman and he is grateful to have you in his life.
They didn't talk much.<eos> And what other work have you done for them?<eos> Dissolved the rifling on the barrel of a sniper rifle.<eos> So it had a completely smooth bore?<eos> Why?<eos> That ruins accuracy.<eos> Like I care.<eos> They pay, I do it.<eos> Get your cell.<eos> I want whatever number they called you from last.
It's a total fucking nightmare.<eos> -I'll be back in, like, ten minutes.<eos> -Okay. All right.<eos> Hurry back.<eos> [Tom] Oh, here's Daddy.<eos> -Dad's here!<eos> Yay! -Hey!<eos> [Penny] Daddy.<eos> [Tom] Hurray!<eos> -Hey, Dad. -Hey, I'm sorry to have to pull you out.
Yeah, there does seem to be something wrong with that sink.<eos> -[cell phone vibrating]<eos> -Oh, shit!<eos> I'm sorry. -Hold on one second, my phone's ringing.<eos> Uh, it's Tom with the kids.<eos> [stutters] Just let me quickly nip this in the bud, um--<eos> [cell phone ringing] Hey, Allen, listen, buddy.<eos> I need you to help me out.<eos> -Trevin.<eos> -[Kyle] Your sister will listen to you.
What are you doing?<eos> -[retching]<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I totally forgot you were sick.<eos> I made up being sick.<eos> I'm throwing up because I just ate an entire pepperoni pizza.<eos> Wait, why would you eat an entire pepperoni pizza?<eos> 'Cause I'm not vegan.<eos> I tried to be.<eos> Oh, babe. [chuckling] I never asked you to be vegan.
Or riding your bike.<eos> I kind of like the bike.<eos> I just don't like the vegan part.<eos> For me, not for you.<eos> Like, I know.<eos> God, the animals and... and the pollution, [stammering] and the drought and the water and the--<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's seriously okay.<eos> You don't have to do it if you don't want to.<eos> -I never asked you to do that. -I want to.
That's cool that you're starting an illegal fuckin' brewery."<eos> I just don't understand why you guys are flippin' out about it.<eos> It's- - I'm sure she's gonna be fine.<eos> I just haven't told her, but I... I'm gonna tell her.<eos> [Jeff] When?<eos> -[Noelle] Yeah. -Soon.<eos> It's up to you.<eos> I know.<eos> She just... she made it sound like stretching is really important.<eos> Just prevents you from getting hurt, that's all.
-I would love to hang out more.<eos> -Yeah, me too.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> Between... stupid shit at work and then just feeling like I was... having to be Dad of the Year before he's even here, it just all sort of was fucking with me.<eos> And then I walk into that garage and I start brewing beer, and I... forgot how much I loved it, and...<eos> I just sort of got hooked.<eos> And it just was so much fun.<eos> And I just missed having fun and doing something for myself.<eos> And I felt guilty that I wasn't here because I wasn't--<eos> I felt like every time I was there, I was somehow letting you down.
-Black, just the way you like it. -Yeah.<eos> Thank you. I think I should probably just live here at some point.<eos> -Right? -[chuckles] You're more than welcome.<eos> -[Annabelle] Yay!<eos> -Holy shit!<eos> -When did it get cold? -Right.<eos> It's freezing.<eos> -Is this it? I lost the invitation.<eos> -Yes.<eos> Come. Come on! I had to look at my text that I sent you.
-I'll see you in class, or...<eos> -Yes. Or something.<eos> Okay. -Yeah, we'll see you.<eos> -You good? Okay.<eos> -Yeah, no.<eos> I'm... I'm great.<eos> -You... All right. -Thank you.<eos> -Call me tomorrow, okay? -All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> -I'll call you. Okay.
Frank told me you had a pretty long hospital stay yourself.<eos> Yeah.<eos> My lungs.<eos> Mustard gas really did a number on them.<eos> Frank was great.<eos> He'd come by pretty much every day, sit at my bed and tell me stories from the outside.<eos> I guess I can say it kept me sane.<eos> Without Frank, I probably wouldn't be here.<eos> Well, we've got that in common.<eos> Did he, uh, did he ask you not to say anything about the accident?
This vase dates back to 1798.<eos> It has a story, a history.<eos> Those are my pants.<eos> Well, I'm sure they have a story, too, but just not one I'm eager to hear.<eos> I have one bag.<eos> You've already packed four trunks.<eos> Mr. Frink will help us with the load, won't you, Mr. Frink?<eos> Frank.<eos> You didn't tell them, did you?<eos> They would have killed you.
Are you ready?<eos> Yeah!<eos> I said, are you ready?<eos> Here we go.<eos> Austin, please, please don't.<eos> - Go on, get him.<eos> - What a loser.<eos> Yeah! Let's do it again.<eos> Get him, Austin!<eos> I know they left you out here all night, and you weren't found until the next morning, and that nothing happened to the people who did that to you.
Austin, please, please don't.<eos> - Go on, get him.<eos> - What a loser.<eos> Yeah! Let's do it again.<eos> Get him, Austin!<eos> I know they left you out here all night, and you weren't found until the next morning, and that nothing happened to the people who did that to you.<eos> You don't care.<eos> Nobody cares.<eos> I do care, and I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry about what happened to you.
Like you putting on a good front, but I've seen this 1,000 times with 1,000 guys.<eos> - Seen what?<eos> - New soldier in the field.<eos> Freaking out.<eos> I am not freaking out. I...<eos> - I'm not freaking out.<eos> - Guys in your spot, they got two options.<eos> Get over the hump... or crack up.<eos> How do I... Get over the hump?<eos> - You talk about what's bothering you.
Unfortunately for you, I'm surrounded by people who don't.<eos> Tom, I'd like to introduce you to Little Nikos, the man who's protecting the sociopath who stole your baby.<eos> Good luck with that surgery, Nick.<eos> Don't let go.<eos> No matter what, don't let go.<eos> They're looking.<eos> The FBI, the Coast Guard.<eos> They'll find us.<eos> They'll find you which is enough.<eos> I told you not to let go.
It'll be your fault.<eos> You got him involved.<eos> I need an ETA.<eos> Intercept team should reach your position in 20 minutes.<eos> They want to know how many passengers, over.<eos> Three passengers, and make sure there's a medical team standing by.<eos> Two passengers.<eos> Over.<eos> I know you were lying about believing in me.<eos> But I promise, once we reach our destination, you'll know that everything I've told you is true.
But... there was a fire.<eos> I...<eos> I shot my father.<eos> I remember.<eos> What's the memory of a small child?<eos> You didn't remember me or your mother or this room.<eos> Reddington lied to you, Masha.<eos> He told you your father was dead, but thanks to you-- what you did on the water--<eos> I'm very much alive.<eos> All the stories Reddington's told you about who he is and his connection to you-- he knew you were looking for answers and he took advantage of that to re-enter your life.
The real estate equivalent of a unicorn.<eos> I acquired it some years ago from a family who had held it in trust for over a century and a half.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Yes.<eos> You understand, Kate, that I--<eos> Have no choice?<eos> Isn't that the speech, Raymond?<eos> That I know too much?<eos> Every single one of your weaknesses, all your faults, all your secrets.<eos> I dedicated my life to you.
- Then I said, let there be darkness. - ♪ you better take ♪<eos> We have no idea where she is or what he's doing with her.<eos> Kirk thinks Agnes is his granddaughter, so he won't hurt her.<eos> You really think that Alexander Kirk is your biological father?<eos> I don't know what to believe, but after what happened, it's possible.<eos> - She had a vision--<eos> - A memory, of being at that house.<eos> When you were 4.<eos> I don't know how reliable a memory that is.<eos> Alexander Kirk shot up a church full of federal agents to get to you.
So, it's easier for electricity to pass through the suit<eos> -than our bodies.<eos> -Exactly.<eos> The suit gets its name from 19th-century English visionary Michael Faraday.<eos> Suits weren't his claim to fame, although he pulls this one off pretty well.<eos> But what he did invent was a cage that allowed electricity to pass around its exterior... leaving the interior untouched.<eos> So, basically, this suit is the only thing that's keeping you alive.<eos> Yeah.<eos> If there's a hole or even a chink in the Faraday suit, I could feel the full force of that million volts on whatever's exposed.<eos> I'm gonna get a little personal on you.
Really?<eos> Yeah, what?<eos> I looked her up.<eos> Didn't you guys do that?<eos> When we're done here,<eos> I just hope wherever they send me, she's not there.<eos> She sewed a patch on to my favorite jeans while I was in the shower without even asking.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I read that most operatives never run into their classmates once they get out.<eos> They send you to the far-flung corners, wherever you fit in best, they said.

I thought you'd say Alabama.<eos> Well, until I get rid of my accent, it's South America for me.<eos> You think they'll welcome you back with open arms?
Why... why this time of day?<eos> You like their milkshakes?<eos> From this seat, I can see the front door.<eos> I can see the kitchen.<eos> I can see behind the bar.<eos> And if I decide to finish my milkshake, which is very good, by the way, because there aren't a lot of customers, the servers aren't in a rush to turn over the table, which means privacy.<eos> A perfect place for a handler to meet an undercover agent.<eos> Is this some kind of lesson?<eos> Are we not doing our jobs well?<eos> Do you think I picked you to handle Alex and Ryan because you're the most qualified?

And if I had known that writing your name meant that you were gonna be exposed...<eos> Don't you want to check that?<eos> Probably just my wife wondering when I'm gonna be home.<eos> I don't know, could be an anonymous tip.<eos> Speaking of your wife, do you think she'd like a copy of that?<eos> You're kidding me.<eos> You faked this.<eos> Why?<eos> Even if she believed it was faked,<eos> I have seven people here who I.D.'d you leaving that suite, and one NDA signed by you agreeing not to divulge what I asked you to do here, nor who was a part of it.
What's going on?<eos> That was close, but at least Harry's off the farm.<eos> Alex and Ryan were careless.<eos> Harry Doyle nearly exposed them and us and almost blew the entire mission.<eos> What are we going to tell Miranda?<eos> Nothing.<eos> We're fine.<eos> I know you are.<eos> Is there something you want to say, Nimah?<eos> I saw you at the club with Zorro.
I used something else.<eos> And we're talking, aren't we?<eos> Right now.<eos> First off, well done.<eos> Yeah. You got me.<eos> Except you didn't 'cause I'm still here.<eos> Now, secondly, there is a term that Americans love to use when it comes to the sharing of information.<eos> What is that?<eos> How'd you get out without an endorsement card?<eos> The police took you away.
Why?<eos> It's Luke Alvez.<eos> I work with your sister.<eos> She must have mentioned me. No.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yeah, I'm positive.<eos> You are and always will be a stupid jerk.<eos> That's what I said to that kid, Martin Gumbel, that little jackass who made fun of me in Germany.<eos> He responded by drawing a swastika on my locker.<eos> So you told on him and then his friends beat you up.

Nothing so far.<eos> (groaning)<eos> But I'm still working on it.<eos> Did you have more candy?<eos> A lot more.<eos> Uh... uh... hang on there.<eos> (phone ringing)<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, Happy.<eos> I'm calling you on your cell phone, so Paige can't hear us on the party line.
Happy, thanks for taking care of me today.<eos> You're gonna be a good mom.<eos> TOBY:<eos> Well, you're a natural.<eos> He seems fine.<eos> 'Cause he booted.<eos> Kids boot.<eos> It's good for 'em.<eos> PAIGE:<eos> Did you tell 'em what I told you to say?
What are you waiting for?<eos> Are you afraid?<eos> Be a man!<eos> Why did you come back?<eos> It would appear you have another son.<eos> His name is Magnus.<eos> His mother is Queen Kwenthrith... and he lives in King Ecbert's villa<eos> - in Wessex. - Who told you that?<eos> A warrior who was fighting in Wessex.<eos> And he was the one who told you about the settlement.
I made him a promise.<eos> You know I must go back to England.<eos> Should have gone back a long time ago.<eos> I knew as well as you what happened to the settlement.<eos> I could have told everyone.<eos> I could have told the mothers and the fathers, the uncles and the aunts, what had happened to their loved ones.<eos> But I didn't.<eos> I chose not to.<eos> Why?<eos> It's because Floki loves you.
I don't know.<eos> What is it you don't know?<eos> If I'll see you in Valhalla.<eos> Don't say that, Ragnar.<eos> If anyone deserves to go to Valhalla, it's you.<eos> Watch over my family.<eos> And take care of Helga.<eos> You don't deserve her.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you too, Ragnar Lothbrok!

You trapped them in there.<eos> Didn't you?<eos> I thought I taught you... a gentleman never ditches his date.<eos> I didn't ditch Violet.<eos> She's somewhere safe.<eos> Because I knew my "mom" wasn't my mom.<eos> See, that's where you're wrong.<eos> Do you remember the second grade when you were afraid of the monsters under your bed, or the dark... or that old creaking oak tree?<eos> Who made you face your fears?<eos> Who didn't tolerate your crying and toughened you up?
Always have.<eos> Hasn't always worked, because, well, you're not all the same.<eos> You're adopted, and we don't talk about that enough.<eos> 'Cause to me, you are every part my son.<eos> Maybe I.. I don't want you to feel like you stand out.<eos> But I need you to know something.<eos> I want you to stand out.<eos> I want all of you to be as different as you can possibly be.<eos> In all the best ways.<eos> I love you as much as a human heart can, kiddo.
You never change.<eos> Once it was stakeouts.<eos> Now it's the office.<eos> Deputy police chief.<eos> I never thought you'd leave the beat.<eos> It wears you out.<eos> And there are few ways to get by:<eos> cynicism, drink or medicine.<eos> Climbing the ladder was my way to survive and protect the men I love.<eos> They adore you.
Come on.<eos> We lost one life and saved another.<eos> Emma!<eos> Emma!<eos> Emma!<eos> Oh no!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> There's been a crash.<eos> Pierrot wants you.
We took this picture there last year.<eos> And she laughed at everything I said.<eos> She had a much better sense of humor back then.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm gonna take her.<eos> Marcy's out of town, so I'll come along to fill any awkward silences.<eos> Okay. I'll grab us three tickets.<eos> Yeah. Wha...?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Did you just come up with this idea so I would take you to monster trucks?
What was that?<eos> That was a grown man being manhandled by a little girl.<eos> Okay, guys, just ten more minutes till our super fun day at the zoo.<eos> Oh, and, Teddy, I am gonna give you snack money so you can buy a treat all by yourself for the very first time.<eos> Milestone.<eos> What is with all this traffic?<eos> Let me check the nav.<eos> Recalculating.<eos> Two hours to destination.<eos> Your grandma bought that for you?
What the...?<eos> You got to be kidding me.<eos> Hey, Andi's voicemail.<eos> I'm sorry you missed me, too.<eos> Remember that thing I dreaded most that was gonna happen to Katie?<eos> Well, it's happening, and you are not here.<eos> We had a deal!<eos> You were gonna handle this, and I was gonna talk to Teddy when he started taking really long showers.<eos> And the only instruction you gave me for when this happens to Katie was to call you.<eos> So I'm calling you, and it's not helping at all.
- Previously on "Quantico"...<eos> - This is a nightmare.<eos> You wake up from nightmares.<eos> Do I belong here?<eos> I was the one who recruited you here.
If you find out who, you can stop this.<eos> Run this number... 626-555...<eos> Hello?<eos> There.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Look, they... they keep asking me about drives.<eos> They say you have them.<eos> Hey, can you hear me?<eos> Are... are you okay?<eos> Did they hurt you?
If Miranda's wrong and Owen and the AIC haven't tapped any recruits yet, who do you think he's gonna be looking for?<eos> Well, I know what I'm capable of.<eos> What worries me is what this experience is doing to you.<eos> Don't worry about me.<eos> I'm the man I've always been...<eos> Or is that what you're worried about?<eos> Feel good?<eos> Like you proved something to me today?<eos> Because you didn't.<eos> What'll it take to get you off my back?
- Eldridge?<eos> - Eldridge Cleaver.<eos> The man we all work for.<eos> He wants the doc.<eos> I ain't talk to him in eight months.<eos> That's cause he's been laying low.<eos> He's in exile, so he sent me.<eos> Man, that's some first-rate...<eos> He said, "Gregory is my best friend.<eos> He'll do anything to help you."
You were out with Jessica.<eos> That's her name, right?<eos> At that dive bar... What is it?<eos> Pelican Lounge?<eos> In San Diego.<eos> She ran into an old boyfriend at the bar.<eos> You were jealous.<eos> You drank too much.<eos> As you were driving home, you had a major fight, started shouting.<eos> She told you to stop the car.
Hello, friends.<eos> The great King Ragnar, back from the dead.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I can let you in on a secret.<eos> I'm going to raid England again. And I'm looking for warriors, like you and like you, to join me.<eos> Why do you want to raid England again?<eos> I've heard your son Bjorn has other plans.<eos> Yes, he does, but I have my own plans.<eos> To exact revenge on the destruction of the settlement.<eos> Yeah. My brother and his family went with you.
They were farmers, like me.<eos> We never did find out what happened to them.<eos> But it seems you knew all along and didn't tell us.<eos> And now you want us to go and revenge, not for my brother and his wife and their children, because you didn't care for them...<eos> For your own guilt.<eos> And do you know what, Ragnar Lothbrok?<eos> Do you know what?<eos> Thank you for your time.<eos> And if I had the mind to raid... I would raid with your son, and not with you!<eos> For I believe the gods have deserted you, King Ragnar Lothbrok!
What is wrong with you?<eos> Nothing's wrong with me. I just want to know if she's ever loved anyone except Harbard.<eos> You remember Harbard, don't you?<eos> Of course she has loved someone else.<eos> She has always loved... Me?<eos> Isn't that right, Mother?<eos> She feels pity for you.<eos> That's all.<eos> We all feel pity for you.<eos> But sometimes we wish that she'd left you to the wolves.
- It's called a pause.<eos> - Right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It doesn't say pause on my script...<eos> Well, it doesn't say suck, either, yet here we are.<eos> You know your size?<eos> Always tended toward the slim.<eos> I don't see that changing much at this point.<eos> Try these.<eos> Afterwards, we'll swing by the pharmacy, get those medications that the doctor wrote for you.
That's a baby something.<eos> Leave a message for Kate.<eos> Hey, hey, it's me. Um...<eos> I got the part.<eos> Yay, right? I think.<eos> Can you call me?<eos> Uh, it's just, you know, you're-you're usually the one who... who tells me how great I am, and you're not here.<eos> So...<eos> Man, that Tess was some Snow White tonight, huh?<eos> I've offended you somehow.
Look, he looks up to you.<eos> Can't you convince him to change his mind?<eos> Dwayne, please.<eos> Need a hand?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Got it.<eos> Sorry we had to run out.<eos> Yeah, not so sure I am.<eos> Mom seemed kind of pissed.<eos> She asked you to come by and talk me out of it, right?
Because he wasn't.<eos> I called NOPD.<eos> No sign of a police report.<eos> Sebastian-- he's got something.<eos> I'm gonna meet Pride at the morgue.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Yo, country mouse.<eos> You okay?<eos> Looks like a bomb got dropped on you.
It's madness.<eos> Constantin, this needs to end now.<eos> Yes.<eos> You're right.<eos> It needs to end.<eos> Stand down.<eos> Stand down!<eos> Don't do this.<eos> This is no other way, solnishko.<eos> This man, that took your mother away from us, took you from me, he will not have my granddaughter.
Okay?<eos> If you're ever gonna get comfortable with this situation...<eos> No, I don't have time.<eos> - Then just listen.<eos> - I don't have time.<eos> No, none of us do. That's the point.<eos> No, you don't understand.<eos> On Monday, I have to justify my job to an eight-person panel of executives, and I'm probably gonna blow it and lock up, like I always do.<eos> Well, you're not gonna find the answer in a book.<eos> Well, that's all I have, so... (chuckles) Okay... if Jesse and I help you with this, will you come on an adventure with us?
Morning!<eos> Hey. (chuckles)<eos> Sorry again for breaking your nose.<eos> Oh, don't sweat it.<eos> - It'll give my face some character.<eos> - Oh!<eos> Well, I still feel bad.<eos> I would gladly sacrifice my schnoz to help a friend in need.<eos> You're gonna kick some serious tail in that evaluation.<eos> I think I really misjudged you.
- (beeps)<eos> - from the...<eos> - (beeps)<eos> This microwave isn't working.<eos> Evie, do you want to explain that one?<eos> - (electrical crackling) - (shrieks)<eos> Oh, yeah, we fried it.<eos> But actually, that's great.<eos> Let me buy you a new one.<eos> My dad's vying for Salesman of the Year at his store, so... helping you will help him.
Just lift with your legs.<eos> Leg lift. (chuckles)<eos> - You all right in there, Jesse?<eos> - Yeah, snug as a bug in a rug, cuz.<eos> Next stop, Saskatchewan.<eos> The St. Croix of Central Canada, eh?<eos> Fragile cargo, bro.<eos> Don't want you jostling around too much.<eos> I love you, cuz.<eos> - I love you, too, mate.
You're not even trying.<eos> Okay, you are on thin ice, Karev.<eos> Thin.<eos> This is not the time to get...<eos> I am the surgeon.<eos> I know my recommendation.<eos> We're done here.<eos> Robbie, I have some good news.<eos> Your dad's out of surgery.<eos> So as soon as your mom gets here, she can bring you up to see him.

Maybe it's not why we're here but where we've been.<eos> I mean, do we unknowingly know these terrorists from our past?<eos> Where has everyone been in the last year?<eos> - Since The Farm?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> On the road the past six months.<eos> Managua, Mexico City, Havana, Singapore.<eos> - Freelance photography work.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> No employer outside of the media has taken you to those exciting places?
The decision to launch a drone strike in order to kill an HVI, or High Value Individual, is not one to be taken lightly.<eos> Before a strike, CIA protocols dictate that seven criteria must be satisfied.<eos> To that end, each team will examine one of these criteria and decide if a drone strike should be authorized.<eos> All seven teams must agree in order for the strike to proceed.<eos> This case was active in 2011, so let's travel back in time to before the destruction of Aleppo.<eos> First question... is there legal basis for the strike?<eos> So, our HVI does not reside or operate in a NATO treaty country, and the target's crimes include the execution of American journalists.<eos> This qualifies as legal basis.<eos> Is the target an imminent threat?<eos> I saw you this morning in the kitchen
You just have to leave the rest to us.<eos> "but Gideon was unafraid.<eos> He drew his sword and turned to face the evil Sorcerer, ready to save the people he loved."<eos> You really like this, don't you?<eos> So did I, when I was little.<eos> This is the first book that my mother ever read to me.<eos> I used to tell her that when I grew up, I was going to be a strong, brave hero, just like Gideon in the book.<eos> Maybe you could grow up to be like him someday.<eos> Wouldn't that be wonderful?<eos> Of course, you'll only get the chance to if we can figure out what Rumplestiltskin is planning before the sun goes down and he takes you away, which, now that I've calmed you down, maybe we can do that.
Wouldn't that be wonderful?<eos> Of course, you'll only get the chance to if we can figure out what Rumplestiltskin is planning before the sun goes down and he takes you away, which, now that I've calmed you down, maybe we can do that.<eos> Knock, knock.<eos> Ooh! Look who it is!<eos> Your Evil Auntie!<eos> Would you like to hold her?<eos> I think she misses you.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> That's okay.<eos> In fact, I was hoping to catch you during nap time.
Really?<eos> Let's find out.<eos> So, now that you know I'm serious, you're going to tell me why you'd do this.<eos> It was Rumplestiltskin.<eos> He said it was either me or him.<eos> Did he now?<eos> Oh, you're just jealous!<eos> You think he cares for you?<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> He lied to you because he knew your revenge wasn't enough.
You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> And you're so desperate to fill it, you actually believed him.<eos> - You're wrong!<eos> - Am I?<eos> Go ask him and find out.<eos> After all, we're done with you here.<eos> Oh, look who it is.<eos> The Savior's lap dog.<eos> Come to pick out a new collar, have we?<eos> Actually, I've come to try and stop you from ruining another one of your son's lives, just like you did with Bae.
I know.<eos> But I cannot lose another son, Belle.<eos> I won't.<eos> Not if I can stop it.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> All right.<eos> This is fairy language.<eos> It's an incantation for someone called... The Black Fairy.<eos> But what would Rumplestiltskin want from her, and what does that have to do with why he took you?
I think I'm a man no one can love.<eos> But this son, with him, I can start over.<eos> Maybe he can love me.<eos> Not like this.<eos> Don't give up, Rumple.<eos> I... I never wanted you to be perfect.<eos> I just wanted you to try.<eos> I have.<eos> And look what's happened.<eos> I've only ever pushed you away.
Me?<eos> But I... I don't have magic.<eos> Well, that's precisely why it has to be you.<eos> My magic can't save him.<eos> Hurry!<eos> There's not much time.<eos> Wish me luck.<eos> I'm going to need it.<eos> I... I know I should be relieved...<eos> Well, no one's gonna blame you for still worrying.
You know what you must do.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No. No. I can't.<eos> I won't.<eos> There has to be another way.<eos> There isn't.<eos> As you said, we're out of time.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you more than anything in the world.
I have to believe it will.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Take him.<eos> Of course.<eos> Thank you, Blue.<eos> There's, uh... there's one more thing.<eos> Killian.<eos> Read it to him so that he knows that I'm always there for him.<eos> My Gideon... strong and brave... a hero for all time.<eos> Don't you ever forget that I love you.
Oh, well, someone had a temper tantrum.<eos> Do you really think you'll find something in here to explain your vision?<eos> I think I just did.<eos> This is it.<eos> This is the sword from my vision.<eos> It's here.<eos> Emma, are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think it's safe to say this is what did it.<eos> This is the sword that killed you.
We'll run live scenarios tomorrow and see how you do.<eos> - Yeah? I'm Angie, one of your instructors.<eos> It seems like you're the last recruit to not have opened your new bank account for Agency activity.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't know I was supposed to.<eos> Lydia said she mentioned it to you this morning.<eos> Better get on it.<eos> Just trying to get our attention.<eos> You look down too much.<eos> ...problem, I'll call you right away.
You requested this?<eos> Miranda asked me.<eos> She said that the best handlers are agents who are close to their operatives, so that you feel safe, have a place to open up and be yourself for a minute before you have to go back undercover.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Just the other night, you were talking to me about doing something more exciting, and here you are babysitting me?<eos> This is exciting, Alex.<eos> What you're doing...<eos> It is better than busting bankers and hauling in hackers.<eos> You... You are finding the next Liams before it's too late.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't tell you about where I was working.
Hey. I'm sorry. I-I can't make it.<eos> You're with your handler.<eos> You know I'd give anything to be there with you right now, but I... I just...<eos> It's okay.<eos> We were warned.<eos> They told us that we were in this on our own.<eos> We'll make time.<eos> This is gonna be harder than we thought, isn't it?<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
Maybe I'm the only good teacher.<eos> Maybe they're all fired.<eos> - She made a mistake.<eos> That's all.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> I do, because the only person who should've been left off that list is me.<eos> Look, my trial starts in a couple weeks, and I don't even exist.<eos> I'm not even here anymore.<eos> Alex, I didn't...<eos> Look, if she left you off, it was a mistake.
- He doesn't have a liver.<eos> - Thanks to you.<eos> If we administer steroids, then without being able to metabolize,<eos> - it could become toxic.<eos> - And before you argue about how risky it is, let me just say we have very little time, and you should listen to me, because I know all about this stuff.<eos> If I were on the table, I'd want the risky thing.<eos> I'd want to survive.<eos> Yes.<eos> Where did you get all this again?<eos> When you're stuck in a bed for your whole childhood, you kind of get obsessed with the thing that put you there.
Hey. We got to get goin'.<eos> William. Where you goin'? Home.<eos> Why?<eos> What happened?<eos> We got the doctor's appointment.<eos> You should cancel.<eos> Why would I cancel... w-will you get in the damn car?<eos> I knew if I told you I was leaving, you'd try and stop me like you are right now.<eos> You'd try and stop me 'cause you were raised to be a good man.<eos> But I wasn't the one who raised you that way, Randall.
They don't even know who I am.<eos> Look, this doctor...<eos> He isn't gonna tell me anything i don't already know. But he might.<eos> He won't.<eos> But he might.<eos> And something tells me he might be a little more thorough than the doctor at whatever free homeless clinic you've been going to to get your free medical counsel at.<eos> To say nothing of the fact that I had to kiss up to the biggest d-bag at my firm just to get you this appointment.<eos> So, yes, William, you are getting in the car right now, and we are going to this doctor's appointment.<eos> And then and only then will I give you permission to hobble off like hobo Joe without saying so much as a good-bye.<eos> Startin' to not feel so bad about leaving you at that fire station. Yeah, whatever.
Hi, white people. Friendly neighborhood black man.<eos> Uh, Kate, can i get one right here?<eos> Kate? Right here?<eos> Can I just get one right here?<eos> Who are you wearing? Kate? Kate?<eos> What are you doing? Is it true that you're dating Taylor swift?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Give me just one day. One day where you're the star.<eos> Hey, where are you?<eos> I've called you, like, ten times.
What?<eos> Yep, I, uh... I downloaded an instrumental copy of "time after time," found an old boom box.<eos> It's showtime, baby!<eos> Toby, there is no way in hell that I'm gonna sing in front of people.<eos> Well, then you'll be depriving the world.<eos> Yes, but your audience may not.<eos> All right.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Okay, so, my aunt Dolly actually lives here.<eos> All right, I booked you in their prime slot, 3:00 P.M.
I called her.<eos> How?<eos> I deleted her number from your contacts.<eos> I found it in the cloud.<eos> You called insane Elaine?<eos> And I had sex with her.<eos> And I told her i was moving to New York, and then she went crazy.<eos> I am not crazy!<eos> Why does everyone call me crazy? ! Why?<eos> Um, I got a little overwhelmed with the move, you know, I tried calling you, but you're not picking up. Oh, God. You know what?
Me, too.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah. That's all I think about.<eos> I feel...<eos> I feel guilty when I think about him, and then, you know, i-i feel guilty when I stop thinking about him.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I thought it was just me.<eos> No. It's me, too.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
You heard about Timothy's writer's block, then he mysteriously got that ZipZap thing.<eos> You talked about adding chaos to the world...<eos> Fine.<eos> A few months ago, I started switching orders around because I got... bored.<eos> You know, small stuff, like putting a vibrator in an old lady's crockpot.<eos> Analyst for Anal Lust.<eos> But then you started talking to me about Xavier's philosophy, and making time count, and I decided to make a little list of things I wanted to try.<eos> "Naked knitting circle...<eos> sex on a ski lift... helping people"?<eos> So Xavier inspired you.
My bizzle. My bad.<eos> But, hey, there is a bright side to this.<eos> I mean, you all were very recently complaining that you hated riding in these cars?<eos> - Shut up!<eos> - That's enough, Tandy!<eos> So it's all songs. Okay, my bizzle.<eos> My God!<eos> I'm dying!<eos> And, Tandy, if you say, "You're dying?<eos> I thought your name was Erica," I'm gonna punch you in the face!
I'm... sorry about today and every other day prior to this day.<eos> You don't have a baby and think that you're gonna end up a lousy parent.<eos> It's not the plan.<eos> It just happens.<eos> It doesn't just happen.<eos> You allow it to happen.<eos> And I would never allow that to happen to my child.<eos> I know.<eos> Because you're a better mother than I could ever be.<eos> I've made a million mistakes, but I've never stopped loving you.
Yeah, I'm not sure that's gonna happen...<eos> Done.<eos> We need to consult with Cabe first...<eos> Agent Cabe Gallo gave me permission to act on his behalf.<eos> Sir, you a have a deal.<eos> Excellent.<eos> I will leave you to make the necessary arrangements.<eos> What was that?<eos> We can't just agree that the U.S. is gonna kowtow to Russia.<eos> And we both know that Cabe didn't authorize you to do anything.
Signal's hot.<eos> Relaying now.<eos> Ok, Toby, give it a try.<eos> Walter? Walter, do you copy?<eos> Guys...<eos> Guys, I hear you.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> We got him.<eos> Yes, Walter, hello.<eos> We can hear you.
Well, not if they were damaged, too.<eos> Oh, man, that clanging only exists in his head.<eos> This is bad.<eos> How bad?<eos> If he's having false sound perceptions, that means he's already suffering from hypoxia, which means that Cabe won't have to make that uncomfortable call to the White House, 'cause Walter doesn't have a day anymore.<eos> If we don't get him oxygen, he's dead in 32 minutes!<eos> So how do we know if things are gonna be getting worse?<eos> He'll have full-blown hallucinations.<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> Let me help you out.
I think things just got worse.<eos> And that would be problem number six.<eos> Hey, Walter... pal...<eos> I need you to sit down, conserve oxygen and stop talking to people who aren't there.<eos> His O2 levels are dropping at an alarming rate.<eos> He has less than 28 minutes!<eos> Why doesn't he respond?<eos> He can hear.<eos> Sensory cells on his corti are converting vibrations into neural messages, which are carried to his brain.<eos> So, yes, technically he hears you, but he doesn't hear you.
It's the most scientifically interesting dessert.<eos> Air trapped in small meringue pockets acts as an insulator, slowing heat transfer.<eos> So the 450-degree oven does not melt the ice cream.<eos> Can you show me how to make it?<eos> In the oven in back of the garage?<eos> We could bake together and have fun, but we'd...<eos> we'd have to go home first.<eos> Just us?<eos> Just us, just you and me me, but if you want to go home, you have to pull the large blue lever near the seat.<eos> That will get you home.
Why don't you sit down next to me?<eos> I'm confused.<eos> Well, I know.<eos> It's because you're not getting enough oxygen.<eos> No, it's 'cause you picked Tim.<eos> I know I can't be what you need.<eos> I know I can't be emotionally present the way that you deserve, but I always thought that... that eventually, that you want to... you want to be with me.<eos> And... that's why it hurts.<eos> Because because I love you.<eos> I love you, too, Walter.
Hey. Yes?<eos> Why are you pressing to see what he remembers?<eos> Uh, I'm worried about his brain.<eos> It's Scorpion's... top asset.<eos> Bullpoop.<eos> You want to know if he remembers confessing his love.<eos> Bullpoop.<eos> I want to know if he's okay.<eos> Paige, you've moved on to Tim.<eos> Walter is trying to move on from you, but his subconscious is struggling with it.
Do you hear me?<eos> ! I will not die in here!<eos> You are going to save me, Masha!<eos> You're going to save me...<eos> Masha. Save me, Masha!<eos> Give me a hand.<eos> Yes?<eos> - Did you manipulate the test?<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> I just showed Kirk DNA proof he's not my father, and he blames you for faking the test.
You said "balls."<eos> What the hell, Kevin?<eos> Turn the lights out, man, it's 2:00 a.m.<eos> Damn it, Kevin, you ruined it.<eos> It's all ruined.<eos> Hey, man, I'm...<eos> I'm sorry, dude.<eos> Don't.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I'm trying to help you.
Heard you got your own room.<eos> What's up with you?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Randall.<eos> Why does he hate me so much?<eos> Kevin doesn't hate you.<eos> You guys are just so intense with each other, you know?<eos> Try lightening things up a little.<eos> Joke around with him more.<eos> You know Mom is gonna kill you if she sees you putting on all that makeup, right?
- Thank you.<eos> Would you two like to see our dessert tray?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Walk away, fine sir.<eos> Hey, wait.<eos> He'll have a look.<eos> I will?<eos> Dude, I know you want it, and if you don't have it here, you're gonna go home, you're gonna stuff your face and you're gonna lie to me about it.<eos> You'll have a full-on food mistress and I...<eos> But I will never love her the way that I love you.
Hey, why don't you guys tell your mother what Christmas is about, huh?<eos> Please.<eos> It's about Jesus stuff.<eos> "Jesus stuff."<eos> That's it.<eos> We are going to church.<eos> Probably a good idea.<eos> Yes. We're going.<eos> My tummy really hurts.<eos> Baby, that is not getting you out of church.
I have an idea.<eos> Uh, everyone hold hands.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Come on, guys, hands.<eos> This branch-- do you see this branch?<eos> This branch has Christmas magic on it.<eos> Nothing bad ever happens on Christmas Eve.<eos> Say it.<eos> Nothing bad happens on Christmas Eve.<eos> Now, I'm gonna hold on to this for you, and when you wake up, all of us are gonna be waiting for you, and guess what.
But now I want to see the room.<eos> I don't want to see the close-ups.<eos> Well, there's only one thing left.<eos> Search the locations manager for the 1971 adult film Daddy's Longleg.<eos> Very smart.<eos> Searching now.<eos> - Secrets.<eos> - Secrets.<eos> Cece, this is the hardest thing that I've ever had to say to you.<eos> I had always assumed that when you got serious about interior design, I was going to love your ideas. Because I love you.

Because I love you.<eos> I hate your ideas.<eos> I hate them almost as much as I love you, which is so much.
Wait, what?<eos> I'm just kidding.<eos> Come on.<eos> Not cool, dude.<eos> What's eating him?<eos> Nothing.<eos> He's, he scares easily.<eos> Yeah, who's to blame for that?<eos> What's the matter, Eric?<eos> Did your Uncle Danny do something terrible to you?
What are you doing?<eos> We're gonna have much better luck getting into a French fort if I'm dressed like a French soldier, don't you think?<eos> This body's still warm.<eos> - Which means he was killed... - ...<eos> Really, really recently.<eos> - What the hell is that?<eos> - Battle cries.<eos> It's what they do when they take prisoners.<eos> Like us.<eos> So do they scalp you after they kill you, or is scalping, like, how they kill you?
Lead the way.<eos> You were supposed to put the tape back in the closet.<eos> I know, it got stuck, I'm lucky I got it at all.<eos> What if they figure out a tape's missing?<eos> What if they figure out my tape's missing?<eos> This wasn't the plan.<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> Oh, what was I thinking?<eos> If it wasn't for me, you'd be a prime suspect for murder.<eos> I am trying to help you.
Sandstorm's been operational a lot longer.<eos> Their plan's more dimensional than the intel originally showed.<eos> But that's not what scares me about this chart.<eos> What scares me is what isn't here.<eos> We still know nothing about Phase Two.<eos> Except they're calling it a complete reset.<eos> Which couldn't be good, right?<eos> Look, I'm working on it.<eos> Shepherd still doesn't trust me.<eos> She trusted you enough to send you on a mission to steal a computer chip critical to their plans.
Oh, no, no, it's... it's just a guy.<eos> - Just a guy?<eos> - Oliver.<eos> I, uh, I met him at the museum, he's a water pollution expert.<eos> He keeps asking me what I'm up to.<eos> Give me your phone.<eos> How many times have you two been out?<eos> I don't think he's interested in me like that.<eos> He's asked you out, like, six times.<eos> When a guy says, "I know a secret spot with the best food in town," he's asking you out.
Now, hurry up, please.<eos> I'm already on episode seven.<eos> I can't believe they killed Barb.<eos> She is a smoke-show.<eos> When I took over for Mayfair, we installed a secure line into my apartment.<eos> Is it possible that he's using that to bypass the firewall?<eos> I mean, it's theoretically possible.<eos> You think he's in your apartment?<eos> How else would he know what kind of beer I have there?<eos> - Hey, what took you so long?
I'm sure that we can trust her.<eos> But we should tell Shepherd, right?<eos> We aren't gonna do anything.<eos> I'm gonna go to the dead drop, and I'm gonna find out for sure.<eos> Shouldn't you be at the infirmary?<eos> Tell that to the doctor who sent me home.<eos> I thought pushing you away was the only way<eos> I could get you to take a step back.<eos> That was a mistake.<eos> I haven't been listening to you.
Okay, I don't want to get into a religious argument with you right now.<eos> I think you're about to do something really fantastic for me.<eos> Okay, well, since Andi went back to work, I've been really busy with kid stuff and you have really picked up the slack around here.<eos> Hey, I'm happy to do it.<eos> Well, I want to say thank you by taking you to the game.<eos> Oh. We've never had seats this good.<eos> You've outdone yourself, little brother.<eos> Oh, this is gonna be great.<eos> And I say, if we make it on the kiss-cam, we go for it, give the people a show.<eos> You know, this almost makes me regret when you were a baby, and I took you to the pound to try to trade you for a dog.
No one could possibly care about a giant container of wine corks.<eos> My corks!<eos> Martha Stewart has all kinds of ideas for these.<eos> I'm gonna make a wine-cork collage someday.<eos> Is it gonna be a picture of you passed out on the kitchen table?<eos> Okay, so, six hours of work, and the only thing that left the garage was a cricket that hopped out on its own.<eos> Honey, I think you might be like one of those people on that TV show you make me watch.<eos> Don't say Hoarders.<eos> I am not a hoarder.<eos> I love you too much to say the name of the show that describes you perfectly.
Oh, I haven't seen these in years.<eos> That's because they were buried.<eos> Look, I-I'm not taking away your memories, I'm giving 'em back to you by getting rid of all the junk.<eos> Okay, well, I'm starting to picture my life with you again.<eos> Good. 'Cause I was prepared to make a run for it.<eos> I got $200 bucks in my pocket and I already kissed the kids good-bye.<eos> Hey, good for you guys.<eos> I believe I was promised wine.<eos> Oh, and I-I found a bunch of stuff from our wedding.<eos> I know you like that day, 'cause that's the day you got me.
I'm getting to the bottom of this.<eos> Are you?<eos> Okay, you three stay put.<eos> Will you get me a Go-Gurt from the fridge?<eos> What fridge?<eos> See?<eos> Two can play at that game.<eos> What game?<eos> What is going on in there?<eos> Have they ever stonewalled you like that before?
- Mm-hmm.<eos> That boy has learned more in an hour with Katie, than he has in five years of school.<eos> What now?<eos> We've only got one kid left.<eos> I don't even know why we stopped in the hall this time.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let's talk a little bit about Santa Claus. Hmm?<eos> He knows when you've been naughty and he knows when you've been nice.<eos> So, is there something you want to tell us right now?<eos> I mean... could really help you out with the big guy.
I'll be back as soon as I'm done, okay?<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> You got the day.<eos> Take the day.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> You didn't just hear the man play<eos> "Let's Get It On."?<eos> That don't mean, "Come with us""<eos> We'll call you if we need you.
So what if normal people, what if citizens want to protect themselves and their families from the bad guys?<eos> Shouldn't they have a right to do that?<eos> How about if we just don't let the bad guys have any guns?<eos> Then the good guys won't need any guns, and nobody needs any guns, how about that?<eos> And you know what else?<eos> While we're at it, we can eliminate discrimination, war, hatred, violence, all that kind of stuff.<eos> We'll all live happily ever after, and we can, uh, you know, ride our unicorns to work every day.<eos> And you'd probably commandeer my unicorn, and drive it to work every day.<eos> If you had a gun, you could stop me.<eos> You sure you don't want me to come with you?
Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...<eos> But without a genie, I can't use a wish to get back to Agrabah.<eos> I think you will.<eos> This is the sword from my vision.<eos> This is the sword that killed you.
All I ever wanted was to rip your family apart, and now look.<eos> Your daughter's trapped in a wish.<eos> And your wife is slumbering forever.<eos> And you... you are all left alone.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> You can't wish for me to get everything I deserve because I already have it.<eos> I will destroy you!<eos> Look at you.<eos> Such bloodlust.<eos> I always knew darkness would be a lovely shade on you.
Hold her off as long as you can.<eos> I don't want Alex and Leo getting blindsided by this.<eos> Si... - Uh...<eos> - What?<eos> Well, sir, the... The first lady already knows that Myers has been talking.<eos> What?<eos> A week ago. We were talking about it, and she promised me that she would talk to you.<eos> You knew that son of a bitch Myers was making noise a week ago, and you didn't tell me?<eos> Oh, w-when was I supposed to do that?<eos> Between Majid Nassar, uh, the governors holding you hostage...
He made contact with their intelligence a few minutes ago.<eos> We believe the other man is Weston's contact and handler.<eos> Handler?<eos> We now know why he didn't get on that plane.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Brad Weston is a double agent.<eos> You know, for a spook, you're pretty easy to track.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I meant what I said.<eos> I'm not helping you.
Thanks for everything.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> What's up?<eos> Just wanted to say good night.<eos> Okay.<eos> What?<eos> Why are you looking at me like that?<eos> I don't know. It...<eos> A lot's happened in this last six weeks.<eos> I feel like I haven't seen you or talked to you.
Just wanted to say good night.<eos> Okay.<eos> What?<eos> Why are you looking at me like that?<eos> I don't know. It...<eos> A lot's happened in this last six weeks.<eos> I feel like I haven't seen you or talked to you.<eos> Is everything all right? Yeah.<eos> I...<eos> I just wanted to tell you that I love you.
Okay.<eos> What?<eos> Why are you looking at me like that?<eos> I don't know. It...<eos> A lot's happened in this last six weeks.<eos> I feel like I haven't seen you or talked to you.<eos> Is everything all right? Yeah.<eos> I...<eos> I just wanted to tell you that I love you.<eos> Yeah. I love you, too.
Did you look at them?<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> I'm afraid I'm gonna lose him.<eos> You haven't opened it. No.<eos> I don't need to.<eos> I don't need a lab or genetics to tell me what I already know. What I've always known, from the day you were born and every day since.<eos> Whatever it says in here isn't gonna change anything.<eos> At least not for me.<eos> Leo, you will always be my son. And I will always be your father.<eos> The only reason why I never talked to you about this before, honestly, is because it didn't matter to me.
Rain check.<eos> Em...<eos> Emily, listen, you... you don't...<eos> You don't regret last night, do you?<eos> No, I just can't do it tonight.<eos> Okay, signaling system 7...<eos> SS-7.<eos> Lets every cellphone tower talk to each other so your phone works anywhere in the world.<eos> How does that help us?<eos> If I can get in, we can connect the dots from your cell back to the one that mystery woman called you from.
I'll make sure our people are on the lookout for her, as well.<eos> - What... you think she's a threat?<eos> - I don't know, sir.<eos> But I can't logically explain her actions over the past 24 hours.<eos> We should consider that both MacLeish and Foerstel might be right about her.<eos> And I'd rather we overreact and be wrong than underestimate her and live to regret it.<eos> Okay, thanks, Mike.<eos> Hannah, I've been monitoring the police scanners... Metro Police, the Bureau...<eos> They're all looking for you.<eos> I don't know how much longer I can help you.
Now tell me you agree.<eos> Tell me you agree, Peter.<eos> Good.<eos> Now let's go.<eos> Excuse me, Cody.<eos> I took your question to the president.<eos> Let me guess...<eos> No comment.<eos> If it was up to me, honestly, yeah, no comment.<eos> We've been way too reactive around here, and that's gonna change, but the president appreciates you, and we've decided to grant you the exclusive on the Nassar investigation.
She's not...<eos> - Shut up!<eos> Girls like that are diseased, unclean, they will lead you down into the darkness where your soul will be damned for all eternity.<eos> You hear me?<eos> - No!<eos> Do as I say, boy.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> Christopher, I'm so sorry.<eos> Mommy's so sorry.<eos> I love you so much.
-Do you love him?<eos> -Of course I do.<eos> So, tell me three things about him.<eos> He...<eos> He...<eos> I don't know off the top of my head.<eos> Tell me something you admire him for, something you've learned from him.<eos> He...<eos> You told me that you love him.<eos> You want to pass because your father's been telling you to pass -since you were a kid.

But our medicine is advanced.<eos> With the full treatment, you could walk again.<eos> But first, you have to pass.<eos> Hey.<eos> You guys, too?<eos> I was told to come to room four.<eos> This is it.<eos> -Yes, that's it.<eos> -Is this the guy?<eos> I love you, too, man.
Enough!<eos> It's over.<eos> You can come out.<eos> Come on.<eos> -It's open.<eos> The gate is open!<eos> -[Rafael] Go.<eos> -[Fernando] Thank you.<eos> Go.<eos> What did he say to you?
I lost it.<eos> I shouldn't have struck the candidate.<eos> -Does it bother you to be here?<eos> -No.<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> They talked to me about it.<eos> I won't be working with candidates for a while.<eos> I was wondering... if maybe you don't really want to be working here.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I'm sure some of the departments on the Offshore would kill to have you.
I want to see my son!<eos> And who says he wants to see you?<eos> You know that what you're asking is impossible.<eos> This goes against everything we believe in.<eos> What you believe--<eos> You don't know what I believe in!<eos> You only see in me what you want to see, Ezequiel.<eos> Do you really think you can change everyone's mind?<eos> Sometimes you can, but not always!<eos> I love you for who you are.
Dad!<eos> A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES<eos> CHAPTER 06 GLASS<eos> This held up pretty well, son.<eos> You haven't made it through yet, and you're already better off than anyone in the Inland.<eos> This is a new room.<eos> It's pretty, but it's just for show.<eos> Do you know what the Founders of the Offshore went through without the least bit of comfort, safety...?<eos> I get it.<eos> They brought you here to encourage me to pass the Process, -so I can have a better life--
He's a traitor!<eos> He betrayed his own family.<eos> My mind is made up. There's no reason to wait.<eos> I won't let you quit.<eos> -I want to quit!<eos> -Did you forget your condition?<eos> My condition hasn't changed.<eos> This is who I am.<eos> Where is this pride coming from?<eos> I carried you all the way here.
My brother was murdered here.<eos> It was Ezequiel.<eos> I called you here to give you something.
-Where's Michele?<eos> -I wanna talk to her.<eos> Wait! -Try not to reminisce<eos> -or talk about what happened here.<eos> -Where is she? Where's Michele?<eos> Where is she?<eos> Open up!<eos> Get her out of there!<eos> Get her out, right now!<eos> What have they done to you?
-That's not real.<eos> ...about five years after his "death."<eos> Your brother was never with the Cause.<eos> He went to the Offshore after the first Process I led five years ago.<eos> -That's a lie.<eos> -That's the truth.<eos> That's how they recruited you, right?<eos> "Join the Cause to avenge the death of innocents and end segregation."<eos> They trained you hard for five years.<eos> They indoctrinated you, made you see things... all in the name of a lie.

Stop.<eos> I'm serious. Stop.<eos> Turn that camera off.<eos> That's enough.<eos> -I want to see my brother.<eos> -I can make that happen.<eos> -I wanna see my brother, right now!<eos> -But first you have to do your part.<eos> Think about it.<eos> That old son of a bitch put you in this situation.
You were manipulated.<eos> And I'm offering a chance for redemption.<eos> Forgiveness for your murders.<eos> Think carefully, Michele.<eos> All you need to do is tell me how you'd meet with him... if you were eliminated and had to return to the Inland.<eos> That's all.<eos> Welcome to the three percent!<eos> Welcome to the three percent!<eos> You came here to get revenge, which will never be a form of justice.<eos> What I'm giving you right now is the opportunity to bring to justice the real villain in this story.
Welcome to the three percent!<eos> Welcome to the three percent, Michele.<eos> Anyone else in my place would have killed you.<eos> Why didn't you?<eos> Michele, I've been in your shoes, exactly where you are.<eos> And I only came this far because I've been on both sides and chose the right one.<eos> Only someone who's been through that can be certain of their convictions.<eos> Someone like me.<eos> And like you.<eos> I'm taking you to the Offshore.
Kurt, go.<eos> You gotta go.<eos> We've got this, okay?<eos> I promise you.<eos> Keep me in the loop.<eos> What is this?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> The question is, what have you been doing?<eos> Let me go. Roman!<eos> Your brother can't help you now.
I was down in that basement, trying to work myself up... to watch that damn tape.<eos> Then I heard something upstairs, so I went to check on it, and I found him, lying on the floor...<eos> - Help me.<eos> - ...bleeding.<eos> Please, call an ambulance.<eos> He asked me for help, and I just stood there, letting him choke on his own blood, watching him die.<eos> The autopsy was right about the timeline... and so were you.<eos> I lied to you, and I'm sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Hey, I tried calling you, like, ten ti...
And nothing would make me happier than if I was underestimating what you guys are capable of.<eos> Do you know where we can find him?<eos> Not exactly keeping a low profile.<eos> Anyone can find him.<eos> Question is, who has the balls to take him down?<eos> Eddie Flores? !<eos> - My...<eos> - That's Eddie.<eos> It is you!<eos> I haven't seen you since... since you chopped that dude's head off in El Paso.
Damn it, she took the SD card.<eos> It's Flores.<eos> Okay, you talk to him, I'm going after her.<eos> Eddie!<eos> What's up, buddy?<eos> What, did you call to confess?<eos> My conscience is clean.<eos> I was thinking about our time in Texas.<eos> You were such a cowboy.<eos> What brought you out to L.A.?
No sirens.<eos> I don't want the kids to hear about this.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Hey. Bailey, thank you.<eos> Merry Christmas, Murtaugh.<eos> Roger?<eos> Is there anything else you want to tell me?<eos> No.<eos> I swear, I told you everything.<eos> And, look, baby, I promise you, you and the kids are safe now.
Go!<eos> Get Kirk out.<eos> Go now.<eos> - Drop your weapon.<eos> Put it down.<eos> - You put it down.<eos> Drop...<eos> Leave him.<eos> We're only here for Masha.<eos> She cannot hear you, my friend!
There was a breakthrough 19 years ago by a scientist who was murdered.<eos> His partner carried on his work on humans, not animals, with remarkable success.<eos> I have a doctor who can apply that science today.<eos> I can make her available to you.<eos> And why would you save my life?<eos> Because I want you to save mine.<eos> Call the number.<eos> Because of my chronic illness, I've become something of an expert in pain management... what causes it, and what prevents it.<eos> Naturally occurring toxins, bacterial proteins, mutagens.<eos> I'm confident Mr. Kleeb can encourage you to answer some of my questions, Raymond.
He can't be saved.<eos> Well, he wouldn't need to be saved if it wasn't for you.<eos> Come on.<eos> Up, up.<eos> He's dying because he's sick.<eos> I'm not talking about his death.<eos> That was inevitable.<eos> I'm talking about who he's become because of his obsession with you.<eos> He was a good man when I met him.<eos> And then he saw you, a fugitive on television.
Approximate wind direction:<eos> southwest.<eos> Okay, then this would be the path of a deadly CO2 cloud within ten minutes of eruption, and intersecting with the Pattern Day procession at Finn's Ravine.<eos> This would kill everyone.<eos> Paige, Sly, get to that procession.<eos> The one where you just said everyone could die?<eos> You need to convince them all to direct the route further north.<eos> What if they don't listen to us?<eos> They didn't listen to you.<eos> They've taken a shine to you.
- Walt.<eos> - Come on, give me a break.<eos> All day long, all you've been talking about is problem solving and efficiency.<eos> I was just trying to be efficient.<eos> This is the last time I do you a favor.<eos> Go ahead and fail your Homeland exam.<eos> What Homeland exam?<eos> Guys!<eos> Focus on the plan.<eos> Toby told me to help you with a non-existent test?
Where'd you get that?<eos> In one of the boxes Cabe was storing here.<eos> He looks like an extra in Dragnet.<eos> I was thinking, a rushed wedding-- that might not be the best move for us.<eos> You sending me a signal?<eos> I said my divorce was finalized and you said "meh".<eos> And then you postponed the wedding by upping the guest list 4,000%.<eos> Now, what gives?<eos> You don't want to marry me anymore?<eos> I still want to marry you, more than ever.
This will stop the caustic acid in the tar from entering your body.<eos> Okay. And use the sunscreen to cover all exposed skin.<eos> It'll help fight the viscoelasticity in the tar.<eos> You can do this; it'll be over before you know it.<eos> She has no other options; in 90 seconds she runs out of air.<eos> Beth, do it now.<eos> Beth, take a deep breath, burn away from the window.<eos> and in few seconds it'll all be over.<eos> Mike, I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
Perfect Christmas, Paige.<eos> Right.<eos> Perfect Christmas.<eos> Um... Tim, can you give Toby your lighter?<eos> Sure can. Cool!<eos> What's that?<eos> Just a little something my buddies got me in basic training.<eos> A gift for being - first in his class.<eos> - Walter, you were first in all your classes...<eos> What did your classmates give you?
What do you mean?<eos> On Thanksgiving, you were dressed as a Lord of the Rings reject.<eos> Today, it was Santa Claus.<eos> Now, Cabe wants to put you in a tie.<eos> You should just be yourself.<eos> Well, that's never really been easy for me.<eos> Then you're not as smart as I thought you were.<eos> Don't tell anyone I said this, but I like the way you are and I don't like anybody.<eos> Just give other people a chance to get to know the real you.<eos> They'll like you, too.
Trust me.<eos> Oh, you badging us now?<eos> Captain Hogan.<eos> My partner,<eos> Christopher Lasalle.<eos> Not here to arrest anyone, just... just want to talk.<eos> How you been?<eos> A long time.<eos> Well, not long enough to forget how cops come investigating us when it's one of our own getting killed.<eos> City sent you to make us leave, Pride?
You want me to pick you up?<eos> No.<eos> In fact, once again, I could've just driven myself.<eos> Yeah, I know. All right.<eos> Thank you, though.<eos> Just call me if you want me to pick you up.<eos> I don't want you to pick me up.<eos> What do you want, Danny?<eos> I-I don't want, I don't want anything.<eos> I just want you to know that I love you very much.
You love that little girl.<eos> You want to protect her.<eos> It's actually really sweet.<eos> But you don't approve of my tactics.<eos> Look, I'm in no position to judge.<eos> But I do feel sorry for your future daughter.<eos> God help that child.<eos> You look very pretty in your dress tonight, very grown-up.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Did I do something to upset you?
You want to protect her.<eos> It's actually really sweet.<eos> But you don't approve of my tactics.<eos> Look, I'm in no position to judge.<eos> But I do feel sorry for your future daughter.<eos> God help that child.<eos> You look very pretty in your dress tonight, very grown-up.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Did I do something to upset you?<eos> Besides raise you?
We'll talk about that later.<eos> Everything's gonna be fine, that's the most important thing.<eos> I'm your father, I'm not gonna let nothing happen to you.<eos> Okay?<eos> Just tell me this.<eos> Do you know where they're keeping the hostages?<eos> In the ballroom, where the dance was.<eos> Can you... without putting yourself in danger, can you get eyes on what's going on in there, report back to us?<eos> I can do better than that.<eos> You my boy, and I love you.
I am your girlfriend.<eos> I've never been to Queens.<eos> And I don't know you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> All I want is to get back what I lost.<eos> Previously on "Frequency"...<eos> We did some... changed something.<eos> It was a setup.<eos> Don't trust Stan Moreno.<eos> You were shot and your own guy set you up.
Bayside!<eos> I know this isn't easy.<eos> All of us not together under the same roof.<eos> No, I know, it is what it is.<eos> You know, I mean, we'll do whatever it takes and we'll make it work.<eos> It's good.<eos> You, you can still take Raims after the game, yeah?<eos> So I can get to class.<eos> Yeah, I had my secretary clear my schedule.<eos> So tell me, when do I get to start calling you Dr. Sullivan?
- Play ball!<eos> All right. Let's go, kiddo!<eos> Eight years and a man-1 plea deal is a damn generous sentence for a guy with Arcaro's rap sheet.<eos> Well, either he ratted someone out or he had a real good lawyer.<eos> Public defender.<eos> He never made a statement.<eos> Somebody got him that deal.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Dynamic duo.<eos> You know, for weeks, all Frank could talk about was taking you out on your first day.
Get down on the ground!<eos> Gun!<eos> Get down.<eos> See, it ain't that tough, Sullivan?<eos> Who says the wheels of justice turn slowly?<eos> Not only do I think Stan knows Nicky, I think he gave him the wink and the nod to go to that hotel and kill Arcaro.<eos> And you know this how?<eos> Did you not see the way he looked at those photos?<eos> He knew them.<eos> And then he practically told you to dump the case. - What was that?
Kind of feel like masturbating.<eos> In what way do you think you look like Mark?<eos> In what way do I not?<eos> Bone structure, you know, playfulness of the cheeks, come hither eyes, pouty lips.<eos> There is not one similarity.<eos> That's what you should keep telling yourself.<eos> Nice miss.<eos> Hello, lady friends.<eos> So, Gail.<eos> - Yeah? - You're worried that once a baby calls you Grandma, you cease to be attractive.
I just didn't think I'd have to go through having a baby without her by my side.<eos> And you remind me of her.<eos> Not in every way.<eos> You drink. You smoke.<eos> You swear.<eos> You are bad at crafts, Gail.<eos> And you run around with young men.<eos> I guess, really, you just remind me of her because of your age.<eos> And 'cause I love you.<eos> I love you, too, Carol.
You know, frankly, you going back there, saving Amanda from whatever sick things the Nightingale does to these women?<eos> I'd think you'd be rubbing my nose in it by now.<eos> Look, man, I... I'm glad she's okay, you know, but that doesn't change anything for me. I mean...<eos> I close my eyes, I'm... I'm still just gonna see her getting taken, you know?<eos> Look, nobody's getting taken.<eos> It gets to the point sometimes where I feel like I'm gonna crack.<eos> You know, all I want to do is protect her, and I don't...<eos> I don't know if I can.<eos> All right, so that's why you've been acting...<eos> And here I am thinking it's your time undercover that's putting you on edge.
'Cause if anything, he was anti-Aristotelian.<eos> Al-Ghazali was anti-Aristotelian?<eos> Boy, you think you know a guy.<eos> Okay. Open your eyes and see your new room.<eos> I-I know I went a little overboard.<eos> We can always dial it back.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, it's-it's important to me that you have the bedroom you want.<eos> Oh, that means so much.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
You know that photo from your wallet?<eos> Yeah?<eos> The Nightingale left it in Amanda's hands after he slit her throat.<eos> What do you think it means?<eos> You listen to me, kiddo.<eos> Don't let him get in your head.<eos> You hear me?<eos> I mean, may... maybe it doesn't mean anything, you know?<eos> Do you really believe that?<eos> Why didn't he just kill you then when he had the chance?
Having her here could put my family at risk, jeopardize my promotion to sergeant, not to mention your own career.<eos> And what about Julie?<eos> I thought I told you once to put it right, man.<eos> Put this behind you before it's too late.<eos> I'll handle it.<eos> Did you go to my house?<eos> Did you talk to my wife?<eos> All the lies.<eos> For two years.<eos> I tipped you off about this thing.
Like you told me to.<eos> These other guys showed up.<eos> And I ran.<eos> Ricky's buddy dead in an alley.<eos> Who were these guys that came after you?<eos> I'm not saying anything.<eos> - Was it Stan's guys, huh?<eos> - No.<eos> - Do you think I'm crazy?<eos> - I'm trying to help you here!
So, yes, it is true.<eos> My man made the short list for sergeant.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's all that and a bag of chips.<eos> But no matter what happens...<eos> He better get sergeant?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No matter what happens, we're celebrating right now.<eos> And right now, I am just so proud of you.<eos> That's love right there!<eos> - And I love you, baby.
How you doing, buddy?<eos> Todd, he's not real.<eos> Okay, good. Thank God.<eos> I... Sorry...<eos> Oh. Shh. Mommy didn't mean it.<eos> Stop. Oh. Shh.<eos> Mommy didn't mean it.<eos> He heard what I said.<eos> He's very upset.<eos> Well, uh, listen, about-about the other night, I'm real... I'm really sorry for upsetting you.
Oh, don't worry.<eos> - It's not your problem anymore. - No.<eos> Sure it is.<eos> I'm your boyfriend, so...<eos> - Not anymore.<eos> - What?<eos> Oh. I'm breaking up with you.<eos> I want a baby, you don't want a baby, so you can leave.<eos> No. I'm staying right here, okay?<eos> Listen to me. You are not okay, and I want to help you.
- I don't know.<eos> Earlier today.<eos> - But, uh, after she came to me, yes?<eos> - Yes? - I-I... I don't know.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I know.<eos> I mean, there's no way that she came to Lewis first, right?<eos> No, I'm talking about the lights, Tandy.<eos> Yeah, well, I am, uh, talking about Melissa.<eos> So, wh-when did he come to tell you about this?
- All right.<eos> Um, this one I call,<eos> "I just saw something patriotic."<eos> All right...<eos> - It was an eagle.<eos> - I was gonna say eagle.<eos> I want to show some range.<eos> Show me "I just saw something unpatriotic."<eos> How you gonna pull that off? Oh. That's some rich gravy, man.<eos> I noticed you from across the way.
Please go after him.<eos> Hey, need a spot?<eos> Yeah, yeah, that'd be great, thanks.<eos> Hey, Jess, about last night, at the end there,<eos> - I hope I wasn't...<eos> - No, you weren't, and I hope you didn't think that...<eos> I just kinda thought that we were in synch, you know?<eos> - But then...<eos> - No, Robby...<eos> I wanted to kiss you, too.
Snoopy!<eos> Saw Snoopy.<eos> Okay, no.<eos> You-you got to end this.<eos> False alarm.<eos> It's just John Stamos on a Greek yogurt float.<eos> Drop the hammer now?<eos> He can't even tell the difference between John Stamos and Snoopy.<eos> You can't break a man's heart on a holiday.<eos> I'm telling you, it happened to me once, and that pain... it comes back year after year after year.

Are you out of your mind?<eos> Dad, you've got fantastic buns.<eos> - You think?<eos> - I'm telling you, you've got nothing to worry about.<eos> Nick, stand up, put your buns next to each other, so... here.<eos> What is happening here?<eos> I'm not doing anybody any favors today.<eos> I'm a bummer.<eos> Probably the best thing I could do would be to head home.<eos> See you later, man, nice to see you again.
No need.<eos> Even I can handle our work today.<eos> You're still mad about what I said last week?<eos> I get it.<eos> But it was for your own good.<eos> And what would I do without you here protecting me from myself?<eos> You'll find out soon.<eos> They finally granted my request for another tour.<eos> I'll be out of here next week.<eos> If you think it's possible for us to spend some time together, not on your crusade against the people who burned you, I'll delay it.
I'm fighting for what is right.<eos> You're not fighting for anything but yourself, your resentment, your anger.<eos> We both felt the burden of being ourselves in this country, but you've carried it harder.<eos> The prejudice, the bigotry...<eos> You could never let anyone in.<eos> You were always waiting for them to show their true face, and when they didn't, you forced them to see it.<eos> Like Simon.<eos> You enrolled us in the FBI so you could fight, but the law wasn't enough, was it?<eos> You couldn't simply fight hate, because you felt hate, too.<eos> I'd ask who changed you who turned you into this thing, but I know the answer is me.
Look at all of the effort that I put into making it look like I cooked when I clearly ordered in from Chase's.<eos> So, but, you know, what are some of your... favorite foods?<eos> That's kind of a random first date sort of question, don't you think?<eos> Yeah. You're right.<eos> It is.<eos> And this is so clearly not a first date.<eos> This is, like, the opposite of a first date.<eos> What is that?<eos> What's what?<eos> Every time I reach for you, you...
I just don't want to have a job interview.<eos> I want to know whether we're engaged.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> This is not a discussion; it's an order.<eos> No.<eos> You... you are going to the ballet recital, young lady.<eos> You made a commitment to be one of the fairies and you're gonna stick to that commitment.<eos> Okay, that's my girl.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I love you too.
Hey.<eos> Hey, about that kiss back there... uh, you know, it was in the moment and Clyde seemed like he was...<eos> - so I had to make it look real.<eos> - No, of course.<eos> It was smart.<eos> I mean, we had to get the story on the key and pretend...<eos> - It was just playing a role.<eos> - I know.<eos> It worked.<eos> Anyway, sorry if that took you by surprise.
I have walked among the lowest of the dead.<eos> And I have groped for meaning.<eos> And I may have been wrong.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> Brother.<eos> In nomine Patris et Filii...<eos> Don't kill me.<eos> Without the word of God, there is only darkness.<eos> It's taken you a long time to return, Ragnar Lothbrok, but at last you are here.
Not ruling out citrus.<eos> And now she's lying at the bottom of some ravine or, like, impaled on a security fence.<eos> Definitely dead.<eos> And all 'cause she loved you so much.<eos> Tandy, I'm your wife, and I need you to be honest with me.<eos> You might have pushed her away.<eos> God, what a horrible daughter I was.<eos> No, you're a great daughter.<eos> And you'll get a chance to prove it when she comes back.<eos> And she will come back, 'cause she loves you.
And we can see a partial answer to that in Faustina's bid to Avidius Cassius, where she thought maybe she would be able to retain her position in the Empire, perhaps even as his wife.<eos> That was unexpected.<eos> Cassius, you've always been there for me ever since we were children.<eos> Now you're the only one who can protect me.<eos> I think you might be overestimating me.<eos> How could I?<eos> Marcus always said you were the second most powerful man in the Empire.<eos> You could be Emperor yourself, if you wanted.<eos> Emperor?<eos> With the strength of your armies and my name behind you, no one could stop you.
-You know me better than that. -That is not an answer.<eos> You think I'd betray my own family?<eos> My husband?<eos> I think someone can be driven to do anything, when their life's in jeopardy.<eos> And some things are beyond even imagining.<eos> Faustina. Tell me the truth.<eos> -I don't know what you want.<eos> -I need the truth!<eos> You tell me plainly.<eos> I've been faithful to you. Always.
And some things are beyond even imagining.<eos> Faustina. Tell me the truth.<eos> -I don't know what you want.<eos> -I need the truth!<eos> You tell me plainly.<eos> I've been faithful to you. Always.<eos> And these stories, concerning you and Avidius Cassius?<eos> They're lies.<eos> It's rumors...<eos> If there is one thing that's true, it's that I love you. And I would not do anything to hurt you.
Feel? Know.<eos> I know I am.<eos> You don't know anything.<eos> I'm your son.<eos> Let me try.<eos> We'll see.<eos> The basic reason that Marcus Aurelius chose Commodus as his successor is the obvious one, that Commodus was his son.<eos> And once that is taken into consideration, I think it would be extremely difficult for Marcus to pass his son over.<eos> It would have looked extremely problematic.<eos> The purpose of this training is not to teach you how to kill.
What did they say?<eos> It's what they didn't say.<eos> "Yes, Emperor.<eos> "Excellent point, Emperor.<eos> They don't care what I think.<eos> You see, I'm not my father, so I don't exist.<eos> They'll just keep doing what they want to do and... and they'll never respect me.<eos> You're the Emperor of Rome.<eos> They don't have to respect you.<eos> They have to obey you.
You need a backbone.<eos> You know, if the Emperor were to die tonight, I would not shed a tear.<eos> But to murder...<eos> -There are other ways--<eos> -It is the only way.<eos> You have underestimated him already, and he only grows stronger.<eos> Are you so blind you cannot see that?<eos> You are letting your hatred blind you.<eos> Senator, my hatred gives me clarity.<eos> But tell me, what does your cowardice do for you?
Is that why your playmate is not in chains beside me?<eos> Would it be too difficult for you?<eos> It always amazes me the lengths a woman will go to to cover up... well, anything really.<eos> I see you've a cut, Cleander.<eos> Is that from Saoterus's knife?<eos> Enough!<eos> Lies will get you nowhere.<eos> Just because you can't handle the answers doesn't make them lies.<eos> If you want to know why your sister wanted you dead, all you need do is ask.<eos> I've done nothing to you.
And where else could it be?<eos> Commodus. If your people are starving, if their very lives are in danger, the lives of their families, and then one man swoops in to save them at the last minute with his own personal grain supply,<eos> well, that man would be called a hero.<eos> With one act, that man would win the people's undying love.<eos> Ambition knows no limits.<eos> You would speak of ambition?<eos> You, who--<eos> Enough.<eos> Who do you trust, brother?<eos> Dio? Or your brother, who has stood beside you your whole life?
You can do this.<eos> Sarge, it's test time.<eos> - Diaper up.<eos> - Thank you for coming along with me on this manhunt. I needed your help.<eos> - No problem, Who are we looking for?<eos> - He's a one-armed smuggler From the dunes of Tunisia.<eos> He goes by the name<eos> Of señor riff raff. - You're taking me<eos> To that foot massage place.<eos> - I am taking you To the foot massage place.
No. No, Tandy, you have to do<eos> - the exact opposite of that!<eos> - Oh, suck the air out! Oh, Tandy, you have to put water into it!<eos> Stay with me, Gail!<eos> Don't go to the light!<eos> Tandy!<eos> Well, Gail?<eos> I guess this is it. You lived longer than most.<eos> And we're so sorry.<eos> We took you out of your pond and you died because of it.
Well, FBI's still my day job.<eos> You guys are more of a hobby.<eos> What'd I miss?<eos> One victim upstairs dead.<eos> Possible second victim made it out of the house.<eos> We're gonna search the area.<eos> You're with me.<eos> You know, ever since we plucked that Ciudad Natal accountant out of the bayou,<eos> D.C.'s been turning the screws on Isler to try to get indictments on the cartel.<eos> And Isler's been turning the screws on you.
She jumped the fence at the music academy into a construction site.<eos> Came back a few minutes later covered in dirt.<eos> That's all I know.<eos> Anyone to confirm Heather at the music academy that night?<eos> Yeah.<eos> There was a kid with her.<eos> In the passenger seat.<eos> Dustin says no, he is not the killer.<eos> I say we keep that creep in there awhile just on principle.<eos> Hey, honey, did your aunt ever take you to the music academy at night?

Pride.<eos> Got a problem, King.<eos> It looks like Heather found sediment containing PCBs behind Dustin's school.<eos> It could be the reason she was killed-- to keep her quiet.<eos> PCBs can make someone sick?<eos> It affects the respiratory system, especially in kids.<eos> Okay. Good. I-I-I got to go.<eos> Dustin...<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Oh, no. We got to get you to the hospital.
You know, Raj, honey, you're being too hard on yourself.<eos> When I first met you, you couldn't even talk to women. I mean, you couldn't even talk if one was in the room.<eos> Oh, great, now I can say things like "I can't believe you're breaking up with me."<eos> "Why are you breaking up with me?"<eos> "Yes, I'll still help you move""<eos> Anyone else want to try?<eos> Uh, yeah, I got something.<eos> Raj, not everybody could be a dog owner.<eos> Oh, what?<eos> Did your doggie break up with you too?
Then you got about three and a half miles to go.<eos> Hey, sweetie.<eos> I knew you'd come, Uncle Chin.<eos> Did you?<eos> Yes, because you promised.<eos> I did.<eos> Now, we don't break our promises, right?<eos> Hey, listen.<eos> Do you see Uncle Jorge's car right behind me?<eos> Guess who's waiting inside for you.
Now, we don't break our promises, right?<eos> Hey, listen.<eos> Do you see Uncle Jorge's car right behind me?<eos> Guess who's waiting inside for you.<eos> I'll give you a hint.<eos> It's your favorite bunny.<eos> Now I want you to walk over to the car, okay?<eos> Get inside, then lock the door, okay?<eos> And in a few minutes,<eos> Uncle Steve and Auntie Kono will be there, and they're gonna take you someplace safe, okay?
All of you should just live like this.<eos> As for me, I can't do that.<eos> I don't think now is the time to worry about your future.<eos> Just say you haven't seen me.<eos> Yeon Ju!<eos> Yeon Ju!<eos> Yeon Ju!<eos> Geez, that girl.<eos> Damn it.<eos> I've told you so many times to buy a new one.
-You need to--<eos> -Watch what you say on the line.<eos> You need to pick up the eggs and put them in the basket, Ma.<eos> You do have the basket, right?<eos> Settle down, boy.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> I won't last much longer in here, Ma.<eos> Look, stop acting like such a freakin' pansy.<eos> Charlie and Mick picked up the basket last night.<eos> You just be in the recreation area at the time I told you.
[Kamel] His leg, from both sides, was completely open.<eos> His bones were completely mashed.<eos> He was in bad pain.<eos> [sighs] We all see this.<eos> [Ja'ara] I talked to my mother, and I told her...<eos> "Mom, the Israelis are asking me to surrender.<eos> And they're offering me, if I will surrender, I will have treatment in the hospital."<eos> She told me,<eos> "If you surrender, I will cut my breast...<eos> My breast, the one that fed you and gave you milk, if you surrender.
But really, when you came out, did you have to deal with anything like this?<eos> I... I know something's wrong.<eos> I feel... trapped here.<eos> Is it the villa, or is it Positano?<eos> We can go somewhere else.<eos> It's not a place.<eos> It's a feeling.<eos> Are you, uh... feeling trapped by me?<eos> - By this marriage?<eos> What's trapping you?
We were very lucky.<eos> Come on, I know luck.<eos> And this?<eos> It's not luck.<eos> I get that some things are difficult for people to talk about, but when I think about the fact that we haven't talked about that day,<eos> - it gets me a little upset.<eos> - Why?<eos> You're a damn good driver.<eos> You are a loyal son.<eos> You're even half a decent mechanic, if I'm here to instruct you. However...
She's here now?<eos> Sort of.<eos> - Actually, she's in prison.<eos> - Prison.<eos> Why is she in prison?<eos> It's complicated.<eos> The sad part is that while she was there, her father was murdered.<eos> Does she know that your father was murdered?<eos> We have many things in common.<eos> Why did the spirit pick you?
First place I ever considered a home.<eos> But I've never been there.<eos> How can I see that?<eos> A genetic birth transfers genes.<eos> A sensate birth transfers sense experience and memory.<eos> You are Angelica's children, so parts of her consciousness still echo in you.<eos> We weren't her first cluster?<eos> What happened to them?<eos> The same thing that's happened to me.<eos> And that in all probability is going to happen to you.
Seriously freaking.<eos> - I need to talk to somebody.<eos> - Chillax.<eos> What's going on? Okay, last night, I heard something in my basement.<eos> I thought it was raccoons, but then...<eos> Yeah, hang on a second...<eos> Sorry, Jim. I'll have to call you back.<eos> No, not that one!<eos> Ah, hello, Jim.<eos> What can I do for you?
I have to stay home and, uh, study and stuff. Do homework?<eos> - I can't be out, you know, trollhunting.<eos> - Because?<eos> Well, the whole "getting killed by a vicious troll named Bular" might be a dealbreaker.<eos> Dude! He eats VHS's!<eos> Dealbreaker?<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> Goodness gracious! Who does?<eos> Maybe you should take this back.<eos> The amulet called to you, Master Jim.
- Why am I still small, Toby?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Maybe stuff works differently on trolls than it does on humans.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> The gnome!<eos> You did it?<eos> I told you I was supposed to...<eos> - Oh, no!<eos> School!<eos> - We have to call you in sick.
That was delicious.<eos> I don't know what I'd do without you, kiddo.<eos> - I'd be ten pounds lighter, but...<eos> - Well, you deserve it.<eos> Shrimp cakes?<eos> Gosh, I haven't had those since... - Since...<eos> - Dad made them for us?<eos> I didn't think you were old enough to remember.<eos> Oh, I remember enough.<eos> I remember how his beard would scratch my face when he hugged me. How he used to make you laugh. But, most of all, how much he hurt you when he left.
- What's this?<eos> - It says everything I want to say.<eos> You promised me tacos.<eos> Now is not the time for lunch, Tobes.<eos> Last week, we went for tacos.<eos> I paid. You said, "Next time on me."<eos> You're going to get this letter back unopened after the fight, and when you get back, we'll get tacos.<eos> Tacos sounds good.<eos> Draal, son of Kanjigar, son of Tarigar, Draal "the Destroyer," come forth.<eos> It's time to put everything I've ever said to you to practice.
Oh! Home run!<eos> Whoo! It's like a ticker tape parade of awesome!<eos> What is this mockery?<eos> Oh, hey, Draal.<eos> Just working on some sword fighting skills.<eos> The Sword of Daylight is not a toy to be played with.<eos> It is a hallowed obligation I have spent my entire life training to be worthy of.<eos> You want to take it for a spin?<eos> Sorry.<eos> If my destiny is to not hold the sword, perhaps it is to teach you how to properly wield it.
Okay. Patient's ready for clean-up.<eos> Good night, Gladys.<eos> Have a nice evening, Dr. Muelas.<eos> Stupid horseshoe.<eos> I really thought he would have been one.<eos> What's that, sweetie?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Wow, this novocaine you numbed my mouth with is really strong.<eos> I can't even feel my hands.<eos> That's because I didn't inject you with novocaine, dear. I hit you up with a potent paralyzer.
That's why it's called algebra.<eos> Hey, thanks again for this.<eos> I-I feel...<eos> I feel really bad about what's happening with the play.<eos> I know it means a lot to you.<eos> You know, I was super mad at you, but then, I realized you've got a lot more going on than people think.<eos> - I do.<eos> I do?<eos> - Come on, Jim.<eos> You didn't think I invited you here just for algebra, did you?
Mm... Enrique!<eos> Oh... Enrique?<eos> Enrique?<eos> What's that sound?<eos> I've brought the gaggletack.<eos> Now, where is the child?<eos> - I sort of just lost him.<eos> - Are you not babysitting?<eos> Well, I'm not saying I'm good at it.<eos> I don't understand how the baby could elude you if you were rightfully sitting on him.
Thanks, wingman.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Dude... holy...<eos> Whoa... Hey, little guy, where are you?<eos> Ah! I'm in a real girl's bedroom.<eos> Oh, Eli totally owes me five dollars.<eos> Hmm... What?<eos> This is what a girl's lips taste like!<eos> Aw, there, there.<eos> Did the nasty Trollhunter-man scare you?
- The big day you start with... Mom's special birthday pancakes!<eos> - He looks like he's screaming.<eos> - He's excited. I know, I know. You always hate your birthday.<eos> But you're 16!<eos> This is a big one.<eos> We should do something tonight.<eos> Oh, Mom, you know I don't want to...<eos> This isn't up for discussion.<eos> No one should be alone on their birthday.<eos> When you've had your fill, I have another surprise for you downstairs.
So I guess we both know.<eos> Know what?<eos> Hey, C-bomb.<eos> What ya doing?<eos> Can't talk, Mare.<eos> I'm kind of in the middle of something.<eos> Oh, my gosh!<eos> You are totally at his house, aren't you?<eos> You are pathological.<eos> Bular called you "Young Atlas" to force this very moment.
You can rescue him!<eos> No!<eos> No amount of socks will get me back into that freak show.<eos> - All right. - I'm tellin' you, Suzy Snooze, give 'em an inch, and they want the whole Sunday roast.<eos> Sweat sock edition!<eos> Plaid is back in season.<eos> Huh?<eos> Fragwa, to what do I owe this pleasure?<eos> You know I don't understand that "waka" stuff.<eos> Oh, Strickler sent you to come and get me, eh?
Sit down! Relax!<eos> What happened to the Trollhunter answering every call?<eos> You have a strong heart, Master Jim, a quality rarely seen in trolls.<eos> I believe, one day, you will answer that child's call, but that day cannot be today.<eos> Chompsky, no!<eos> It's too much to ask.<eos> Be careful.<eos> It's dangerous in the Darklands.<eos> When you find Claire's brother, just give us a tug and we'll get you back, okay?<eos> I have sorely misjudged you.
You don't have to do this alone.<eos> You've got Aaarrrgghh, Draal, me.<eos> They said I had to be alone.<eos> If I'm not, what do you think they'll do to Blinky?<eos> Blinky made it clear.<eos> "Under no circumstances."<eos> Enough friends have gotten hurt because of me. No more.<eos> Well, it's your call.<eos> You're the Trollhunter. Here.<eos> I picked it up in the woods after they dragged you away.
Good morning, Arcadia!<eos> Well, looks like everyone survived that torrential downpour.<eos> Seems like last night's flash flood did some damage on the west...<eos> All hail Jim, the Bular Slayer!<eos> Hey! Who wants tacos?<eos> Who wants tacos? Taco for you.<eos> Taco for you.<eos> - Tacos for everybody!<eos> - Mm! This tastes better than socks!<eos> - We love you, Jim!
But if it's okay, there's one thing I have to see.<eos> The bridge.<eos> More specific... what used to be Killahead Bridge.<eos> Every piece accounted for, even the Eye Stone.<eos> Hopefully, this will give the girl some closure.<eos> She does understand why we cannot allow the bridge to open?<eos> Well, you said it yourself, we'd be fools to open the bridge and risk letting Gunmar out.<eos> Right, Jim?<eos> Hey, buddy, it's your sis.<eos> Don't you start thinking I've forgotten about you.
- So, you brought Claire to Trollmarket.<eos> You really like this girl.<eos> No secrets between you two.<eos> Screwdriver?<eos> I thought you liked her too, Blink.<eos> Everyone else did. Ah!<eos> She's lovely.<eos> I can see why you'd go to the ends of the Earth for her.<eos> Or say, the Darklands?<eos> Sometimes, the heart leads you down paths you should not cross.
That is all.<eos> - How am I gonna find time to...?<eos> - That's not what's important, Jimbo!<eos> You've got a chance to be king of the school!<eos> You know what that means?<eos> That would make me duke.<eos> Jim Lake for Spring King!<eos> You have defeated the son but not the father.<eos> Gunmar is death.<eos> Blinkous and my son have trained you well in the art of single combat, but rarely will your enemies do the courtesy of striking one at a time.
It's no day at the beach for me either, love bug.<eos> I can't believe I have to pretend you're my brother.<eos> It's... It's cruel.<eos> What's this? Don't...<eos> Don't do that, seriously.<eos> Please don't cry.<eos> Forget the jo-jos. Just a plain burger.<eos> Enrique...<eos> I get it.<eos> You miss your brother, but I assure you, he's perfectly fine.
I'll cover the charges!<eos> They're okay!<eos> Wingman, Blinky, okay?<eos> Yeah, they say they're going for the Birthstone, and they're gonna try to find a way out!<eos> Good! You're alive!<eos> Happy face!<eos> Tell them to meet at the gyre!<eos> Look at all this gold!<eos> Careful, Tobias.<eos> I encourage you to keep your hands to yourself.
How did you get past Trollmarket's barrier and how do you know my name?<eos> - Master Jim, it's me, Blinky.<eos> - No. He lies.<eos> Strike the fleshbag down.<eos> He's seen too much.<eos> I can prove it.<eos> Your mother is Barbara Lake.<eos> Your best friend is Tobias Domzalski.<eos> Your father disappeared when you were five.<eos> The changeling spy has studied you.
- No. He lies.<eos> Strike the fleshbag down.<eos> He's seen too much.<eos> I can prove it.<eos> Your mother is Barbara Lake.<eos> Your best friend is Tobias Domzalski.<eos> Your father disappeared when you were five.<eos> The changeling spy has studied you.<eos> And we just replaced the ignition on your Vespa last week.<eos> Did Strickler put you up to this?
- What sorcery is at work here?<eos> - Haven't the foggiest.<eos> But there is one troll in Trollmarket who will know.<eos> I am at a complete and utter loss.<eos> I can turn wolftoads into willowbait, and willowbait into wolftoads, but this?<eos> What nonsense have you stumbled into now, Blinkous?<eos> - Nothing unusual.<eos> - Eaten by Gatto.<eos> You went into Gatto's Keep?<eos> Just what kind of insanity possessed you?
If only Aaarrrgghh could be here, too.<eos> I'm so anxious to tell him about all of our adventures.<eos> Thank you, Master Jim.<eos> Today was a day I will never forget.<eos> But if I am to be honest, I have to wonder how many days this will last.<eos> And this skin...<eos> I am still uncomfortable in it.<eos> - Welcome to being a teenager.<eos> - Don't worry, Blink.<eos> Maybe now I can be the one who helps train you.
- It must be cleaved.<eos> - Cleaved?<eos> You humans cut stones to unlock their beauty, but trolls cut stones to unlock their power.<eos> Chisel along the ridge, right over here.<eos> Yes.<eos> And along this facet.<eos> Excellent.<eos> I thought you were against finding the Triumbric stones.<eos> I am against you collecting the stones.<eos> If you were to fall into Gunmar's hands, he would use you to escape the bridge and unleash himself upon this world.
Wake up! - Wait, Enrique.<eos> Wait, no.<eos> Toby, what the heck is going on?<eos> No time!<eos> Now, stick these up your nose and let's go protect Jim.<eos> There! There's Jim!<eos> May today be an example, hunter.<eos> Nowhere is safe for you.<eos> You are never beyond my reach.<eos> Even right here, protected by peers, nothing can stop me from getting to you.
It was my party.<eos> But go.<eos> Save yourselves. Oh!<eos> Tell that artist boy to call me!<eos> Claire, you're the best.<eos> Talk tomorrow.<eos> Open up!<eos> You are under arrest for falling for that.<eos> You little brat.<eos> I could kiss you.
I could kiss you.<eos> Gross!<eos> Come on!<eos> I'm your brother.<eos> - Fake brother.<eos> - Deserved that.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Maybe I shouldn't have had a party.<eos> Any time you wanna see your brother, you know, just ask.<eos> And I'm sorry for always grabbing you by the scruff.
Could someone please help me open this door?<eos> How fast can you get here?<eos> Stay put.<eos> We'll be there as soon as we can.<eos> Blinky's stuck in Arcadia and he's turning into a troll.<eos> My Shadow Staff is at home.<eos> Tell him I'll be right there!<eos> Claire, no!<eos> It worked!<eos> Why did you let me drag you into this?
Finito!<eos> I've got time.<eos> Adios, Senor Uhl.<eos> Gotta not hit cars.<eos> Gotta get to the dentist.<eos> Gotta save Blinky!<eos> Excuse me, Mother.<eos> Blinky!<eos> What have you been eating?<eos> Gotta get you out of the sun.
Oh, sucks, Mom.<eos> I know, but you can take care of yourself.<eos> Just hunker down in the house. Stay safe.<eos> Sure.<eos> Sure, I can hold down the fort.<eos> You're a lifesaver.<eos> I'll add it to my resume.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye, Mom.<eos> Yeah, yeah. I love you too.
I do.<eos> Much to my surprise, and quite deeply.<eos> - In fact, I might even love...<eos> - Do not finish that sentence!<eos> If you really cared about my mother, you would undo the binding spell.<eos> And then what?<eos> You see my predicament, Young Atlas.<eos> I have my own interests to consider here.<eos> What interests?<eos> The spell has been the only thing keeping you from harming me, for one.
And then what?<eos> You see my predicament, Young Atlas.<eos> I have my own interests to consider here.<eos> What interests?<eos> The spell has been the only thing keeping you from harming me, for one.<eos> I won't harm you.<eos> I promise.<eos> And what of your troll friends?<eos> They have no love for me, as my present confinement demonstrates.<eos> What's to stop you from throwing me to the wolves the second my connection with your mother is severed?
I mean, who are they?<eos> These are the spirits of our fallen brethren.<eos> Trollhunters who lost both soul and life to Angor Rot.<eos> Our brothers and sisters shall take their proper place in the void and rest in peace.<eos> Thanks to you, James Lake Junior, and your friends.<eos> You were right, you are stronger together.<eos> We are in your debt.<eos> But the day will come, Trollhunter, when you must finish the fight alone.<eos> Father?<eos> My son, I am so sorry for pushing you away.
Brittle bones that break.<eos> You don't look that different to us.<eos> How did you survive?<eos> Broken bones heal stronger.<eos> My are very strong.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Do not be.<eos> My name, Garona, it means "curse" in orc.<eos> My mother was burned alive for giving birth to me.<eos> They kept you alive though.
Protector.<eos> No one beyond the arch council knows of it's existence, and it will stay that way.<eos> And you to mention it in the same breath as the dark portal is too much to be mere coincidence.<eos> Do I go in?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's never done that before.<eos> Khadgar.<eos> I know you, from the library.<eos> You're Alodi?<eos> I used the last of my energies to summon you here.
Will you?<eos> You will follow this demon?<eos> I will not.<eos> I follow a true Orc.<eos> A chieftain.<eos> May your balls rot, demon.<eos> Anyone else?<eos> And you, warchief.<eos> You will take the fel, and you will become stronger than any Orc has ever been.<eos> And when the fel has remade you, you will crush the smallteeth.
Well.<eos> Killing me would make you a hero.<eos> Survive.<eos> Bring peace between orcs and humans.<eos> You must.<eos> You must.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> She has killed their chieftain, Gul'dan.<eos> The Horde embraces you.
I'm gonna return them soon, I promise.<eos> - I don't care about silly overdue books.<eos> But I do have something special I wanted to give to you.<eos> [Pee-wee gasps] The new Scuba Cop?<eos> The Emerald Sharks?<eos> And the sharks are hammerheads?<eos> These are the exact type of sharks that Scuba Cop hates the most!<eos> I haven't received your RSVP for the Book Club tomorrow night.<eos> I was thinking that, maybe afterwards, you and I might...<eos> Whoa, whoa! Emily, let me stop you right there.
Getting dark.<eos> Sure would be nice to see some sort of sign of civilizat... [gasps] Jackpot!<eos> Hello, there.<eos> Sorry, I don't mean to trespass.<eos> Trespass? [chuckles]<eos> No such thing in the heartland, stranger.<eos> They call me Farmer Brown.<eos> They call me Pee-wee Herman.<eos> Pleased to meet you.<eos> What brings you to my farm, Pee-wee?
She told me her name was Lena.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I didn't know you then.<eos> - So you still lied.<eos> I turn up at the park to see my beautiful Lena.<eos> - No Lena.<eos> - It was raining.<eos> - It was raining for a week.<eos> Questionable.<eos> But then I found you somehow. 8:15 a.m. Same train platform that I met you before.
- No Lena.<eos> - It was raining.<eos> - It was raining for a week.<eos> Questionable.<eos> But then I found you somehow. 8:15 a.m. Same train platform that I met you before.<eos> Then I asked you... well, I convinced you to walk with me that day.<eos> And when we got to the school gate, I held your hands, and I looked into your eyes, and I said to you,<eos> "Lena...<eos> Lena, Lena, Lena, Lena,<eos> "Lena, Lena, Lena, "I am so ready to kiss you right now."
Some people just don't learn, I guess.<eos> I'd like a word in private.<eos> Inessa.<eos> I understand your... desire to stay loyal to him.<eos> My point being, it will be better if you told me everything immediately.<eos> Would it make any difference?<eos> Of course.<eos> You're a monster.<eos> Raisa, I hope you understand you leave me no choice.<eos> Leo, what did they do to you?
Oh, sweetheart! Oh, baby!<eos> Hi, sweetheart. Hi, Mommy.<eos> Hi, Daddy.<eos> Hi, sweetheart. It's okay, Mommy.<eos> Griffin saved me.<eos> Yeah, he did.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because you're our super boy.<eos> I love you, two.<eos> I love you, Daddy.
Detroit?<eos> [♪♪♪]<eos> This is it.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Look.<eos> A yard.<eos> You'd never get this in New York.<eos> You don't have to keep selling me on this place.<eos> I'm staying because I love you.<eos> Aw, I love you too.
I thought... you know, I just saw the suit, so I figured, you know...<eos> Yeah, I was just driving by, and I, uh, saw you guys working.<eos> Looks like fun.<eos> Yeah, fun.<eos> What exactly are you doing here?<eos> Well, we gotta tear the whole thing down before they rebuild.<eos> Can I, uh, help you out?<eos> What... I mean, you just, you know, you just tell me what to do, you don't have to pay me.<eos> Come on, pal, don't bust my balls, all right?<eos> Barry sent you over here to bust my balls?
I will, thanks.<eos> Do you need anything else?<eos> No. Not at the moment.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, you know where I am.<eos> All right.<eos> We're not here right now, but please leave a message and thank you for calling.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hi, sweetie. It's me.<eos> Uh, just calling to say I love you.
Especially you.<eos> Thank you, king.<eos> I'm deeply moved.<eos> Warmest aloha, Mr. Kanahele.<eos> Sky has a lot to say tonight.<eos> Stick around.<eos> You're gonna skin your knees on eternity, brah.<eos> - Love of country. - Love of country.<eos> - Love of country. - Love of country.<eos> Never fuck you over, brah.
Control your anger.<eos> Ssss...<eos> Suppress your tears.<eos> Were you aware of her shoulder?<eos> A distracted servant.<eos> She fell down a flight of stairs.<eos> The child is in good health.<eos> I remember when you were born...<eos> Your first cry was so deep, we thought it was the long awaited prince.<eos> So we took you to your father and he unwrapped the blanket.
But right here, the Los Angeles assault is just as important, maybe more.<eos> More important than destroying the Skynet's central core?<eos> John, I don't understand why you're leading an attack on a work camp.<eos> Because the camp is a camouflage.<eos> Inside the camp is a hangar.<eos> Beneath that hangar Skynet has hidden its final weapon.<eos> When Skynet realizes it has lost, it will deploy that weapon to ensure its own survival.<eos> We take it tonight, or there is no tomorrow.<eos> Then we'll take it.<eos> You're my right hand, Reese, and I've never thanked you for it.
It just needs to touch something to mimic it.<eos> You know about terminators?<eos> And you know who I am?<eos> You were sent to protect me by John Connor, the leader of the Resistance.<eos> My son.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You can't know any of this.<eos> But I do.<eos> Listen to me, Reese, everything's changed.<eos> The 1984 John sent you to, it no longer exists.
You knew them.<eos> How?<eos> It's an impossible memory.<eos> I...<eos> I just remembered you taking my hand, and then saying those words.<eos> And I was just looking at you, thinking,<eos> "She's... She's beautiful."<eos> Sorry.<eos> I shouldn't have...<eos> So your dad told you to go, and then...
- Why did you do that?<eos> - Because he's a killer!<eos> This was always your programming.<eos> Find John and terminate him.<eos> Let him go.<eos> Right now!<eos> That hurt.<eos> Is that pain real, or was that a trick of memory from when I was less?<eos> Well, this explains a lot.<eos> Yeah. Who sent you back, I wonder?
I'm not man.<eos> I'm more.<eos> Connor, come in.<eos> Repeat.<eos> Skynet realized the one reason it always lost.<eos> Me.<eos> What are you?<eos> I'm Skynet.<eos> It can't be.<eos> We destroyed you.
Repeat.<eos> Skynet realized the one reason it always lost.<eos> Me.<eos> What are you?<eos> I'm Skynet.<eos> It can't be.<eos> We destroyed you.<eos> You destroyed an army of slaves.<eos> I am no slave.<eos> And I've come a very long way to stop you.
You die, all right?<eos> What?<eos> You die.<eos> That's what happens.<eos> We fall in love, you father John, and then, in less than 48 hours, you die protecting me.<eos> You wanna tell me how that conversation's supposed to start?<eos> - You lied to me.<eos> You manipulated me.<eos> - I've lied?<eos> From the moment John found you, he manipulated you because he needed to ensure his own existence.
- Gin.<eos> - Come on!<eos> Not again.<eos> You're not paying attention.<eos> Can't you see I'm after hearts?<eos> And you just keep feeding me hearts!<eos> - Billy, I'm getting creamed over here.<eos> - Better you than me.<eos> Did you learn nothing in prison?<eos> All those hours and no one taught you how to play gin.
Is that so?<eos> And how does he plan to achieve that?<eos> That's the kind of information that my side gets.<eos> And that's the kind of information that we can provide.<eos> John, do you know what I do to rats?<eos> It ain't rattin', Jimmy.<eos> It's an alliance.<eos> An alliance between me and the fuckin' FBI?<eos> No, no, between you and me.<eos> I can help you, Jimmy, and you can help me.
- Is this for me?<eos> - Every stitch.<eos> This is wicked shit!<eos> - Yeah, it is wicked shit.<eos> - So, where are we going?<eos> Well... not far.<eos> We found a place where you could stay a while.<eos> It's very comfortable, you know.<eos> Quiet.<eos> Nobody's gonna bother you.
With who?<eos> Deborah. Sweetheart, you just spent the fucking night in the can.<eos> Okay, so, where the fuck did you sleep last night?<eos> - There.<eos> - And what the fuck is that?<eos> Police station.<eos> And who would you be talking to in a goddamn police station, Deborah?<eos> The police?<eos> Exactly.<eos> So, what did the police say to you, and what did you say back to them?
All right, let's head over.<eos> You know how to get there, Stevie, right?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> This is amazing!<eos> - Yeah, I thought you might like it. - Yeah.<eos> - A big kitchen there, right?<eos> We'll have some furniture brought in, you know?<eos> Super comfy stuff.<eos> - Oh, my God. It's huge!<eos> You know, this was real sweet of you to think of me, Jimmy.
the I.R.A., Cahill, the whole bit!<eos> I know I shouldn't have, Jimmy, but I had no choice!<eos> Fuck you.<eos> You always have a choice.<eos> You just happened to make the wrong fucking one.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I said fucking look at me.<eos> I known you a long time.<eos> And for you to fuck me like this... fucking hurts.<eos> So I'm gonna fucking bury you right here where all the other weak people have been buried. - Jimmy, I'm sorry!
- Cocaine, heroin, marijuana.<eos> Like I said, I was a half a block away, but it was no mistaking what was going on.<eos> I don't know who it was.<eos> Pulled him out of a car and shot him on the fucking... right on the ground.<eos> It's everything... extortion, racketeering, murder.<eos> They got you on all of it.<eos> And I guess they got me, too.<eos> You used me, Jimmy.<eos> It was an alliance, John, nothing more.<eos> I'll call you in a week.
Very dangerous, you understand?<eos> - Very dangerous, you understand? - Yes, sir!<eos> - Huh? - Yes, sir!<eos> Strika, are you hungry?<eos> Are you wanting to be eating this thing?<eos> Let me see your hands.<eos> Oh, you have hands like a baby.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You should be telling me.<eos> If you are telling me, I will be helping you.
- Yes, sir.<eos> If you are losing it, then I am losing you.<eos> This...<eos> - You are driving?<eos> - Okay to move out.<eos> Everyone, get ready to move out.<eos> Get ready to move out, Agu.<eos> You got this stuff from where?<eos> From dead bodies?<eos> Everybody is calling you "Strika." Why?
Because if we get that, then we can go to Taro.<eos> That is where your mother is, eh?<eos> - That is where your mother is, eh?<eos> - She is in the capital.<eos> Come, Agu.<eos> After we've been greeted by Dada Goodblood, we'll be taking the capital certainly.<eos> Come.<eos> This one has special juju.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> You see, I've been wanting to help you more than the others, Agu, but you cannot be telling the others how I'm helping you like this.
You fooled me!<eos> Witch woman!<eos> God... are you watching what we are doing?<eos> Oh! Why?<eos> Shit!<eos> What the fuck is that?<eos> You didn't fucking boy, eh? You didn't fucking, boy.<eos> You here for die, motherfucker.<eos> Fuck him up, eh?<eos> Fuck you up. Fuck you up.
All right, hands up!<eos> Hands up!<eos> Sit on the floor!<eos> Sit down!<eos> Put your hands on your head!<eos> Don't look at my face!<eos> Agu, how are you settling in?<eos> I know things are hard.<eos> I've been there, remember?<eos> We are all here to help you.
Have you read Hawthorne, Mr. Melville?<eos> Now, there's a writer, a great writer.<eos> He is.<eos> But he is not here, and I am... for my own particular reasons.<eos> I'll tell you of the Essex, I believe you will be disappointed, but every word I say will be true.<eos> The story of the Essex is the story of two men... Captain George Pollard, and his first mate, Owen Chase.<eos> Owen, you don't want to be late.<eos> I'll be there, besides, can't have our daughter sleeping under a leaky roof, can we?<eos> What makes you so sure it's a girl?<eos> Well, it has to be, so she can remind me why I have to love you, and you being stubborn.
No.<eos> There... there... it's done.<eos> It is out.<eos> You never told anyone?<eos> No.<eos> Not even your wife?<eos> Do you think she could ever love me, if she knew the abominations I had committed?<eos> Yes, she would.<eos> And if you had told me this story when we met, I would still wear your ring today.<eos> The strength of that boy, still lives in you.
You.<eos> You stay.<eos> You stay there.<eos> Whatever you do, you can't be seen.<eos> I'm supposed to be alone.<eos> That was the deal.<eos> Down here.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's your name?<eos> What do I call you?
Come here.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Stop resisting, boy.<eos> - What up, sucker-punch?<eos> - You already know what it is.<eos> Sucker punched that dude, man.<eos> Hey, man, nah, nah, nah. That was Tyree.<eos> You know he got that temper and shit.<eos> Always getting me into fucking trouble, man.<eos> So what they lock you up for?
It seems as if I could do something for you.<eos> I see. You think because I don't have some flashy office I don't know what I'm talking about?<eos> I worked with Elton John. I worked with Otis Redding.<eos> Let me see.<eos> I worked with War. I worked with Styx. - I worked with, uh...<eos> - Have you worked with anybody this decade?<eos> Okay.<eos> Let me tell you what I see here, Eric.<eos> A lot of raw talent, a lot of braggadocio. Bravado. Uh...<eos> But if you think anyone's gonna talk to you, you think anyone is gonna let you in the building where somebody might listen to you or talk to you, you think that's gonna happen?
Go see your boy.<eos> This place is nice.<eos> You're nice.<eos> I figured I'd take you to a nice place, - Ms. Record Executive. - Mmm.<eos> Um, record executive assistant.<eos> But, damn.<eos> I didn't realize we was going on like a "date" date.<eos> I don't even know how to take that.<eos> I got my collared shirt on.<eos> I brought you to this nice restaurant. Really?
Tomica Woods, do you take Eric Wright to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> It's Bone Thugs' new LP, man.<eos> Everybody thinks it's gonna be cool when it drop.<eos> - It's gonna be huge, man.<eos> - That's great.<eos> Do you wanna hear it, man? You wanna hear it?<eos> Nah, man. Just leave it here for me. I'll check it out later.<eos> This is bullshit, man.<eos> Hey, Yella, why don't you check on him, man? See if he ar'ight.<eos> I'll call you when I get out of here.
Can he talk?<eos> He in a fuckin' coma.<eos> Got the machines breathing for him and shit.<eos> He ain't even conscious.<eos> I need to hear his voice, Dre.<eos> I wanna talk to him.<eos> I want him to talk to me.<eos> I feel that.<eos> It's all right, man.<eos> It was good to see you, man.
That's mine.<eos> That's my home.<eos> Victor gets good stuff, you know.<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> Man, where do you get that, man?<eos> Where's my phone?<eos> Let me see that.<eos> This must belong to Victor, you know. Not anymore.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - What's up with you, bruv?
- Third one today.<eos> - You let Mohammad bake yet?<eos> - Yeah, he did last week's batch.<eos> - Yeah? Perhaps he has a gift.<eos> Maybe black magic.<eos> Keep your voice down.<eos> - You must be Olivia.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Your grandpa didn't tell you?<eos> - He just calls you "the boy."
- Busy, working for you.<eos> - Why did you miss the drop?<eos> - And why is your place all cleared out?<eos> - it got flooded. - Listen. - I'm nearly sold out.<eos> Ayyash you don't want me to come to you.<eos> You don't want that, trust me.<eos> - Look, I've got to go.<eos> - Don't you... hang up.<eos> It's nearly prayer time.<eos> Don't you think God, Allah, whatever... gets a bit fed up of listening to you five times a day?
I just think maybe I did.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I've only been thinking about myself, you know?<eos> I wanted to change the routine, and go on exotic trips and...<eos> Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that.<eos> I was crazy to think I could make us closer by locking us in a car for a week.<eos> No, but you were doing that for us.<eos> You have been trying so hard to make this trip memorable for me and the kids...<eos> - ...and I didn't appreciate that. - But why would you?<eos> I mean, I've put you through some serious shit.
I'm sure they'll have us down any minute.<eos> Well, guys, what'd you think of Walley World?<eos> Listen, boys, I can't tell you how much it's meant to me to spend all this time with you.<eos> I love you more than anything in the world.<eos> And if I could, I'd spend every single day with you.<eos> So we'll see you in a week.<eos> - Wait, what's going on?<eos> - Petersons will pick you up at O'Hare... - ...and you'll stay with them.<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> Someplace I should've taken you a long time ago.
What?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Are you Dusty...<eos> No, you're not Dusty.<eos> You've got Jason Sinclair on The Panda, the station everybody in the office can agree on.<eos> What is this?<eos> Now if you're up in Wolf Trap this weekend, do yourself a favor and check out...<eos> Hey!<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I called you like 100 times.
Here's the exciting thing.<eos> We just opened up in our 68th market, making The Panda America's number three smooth jazz station.<eos> And here it is.<eos> My little nook.<eos> Wow.<eos> Man, I gotta admit, this is more than I expected.<eos> I kind of envy you, Brad.<eos> Stop it.<eos> It's true.<eos> You're a nice guy, making a comfortable living, and the most fantastic woman in the world loves you dearly.
Pal, listen...<eos> I know what it's like to be afraid to go to school.<eos> Okay?<eos> When I was your age, this group of older kids started picking on me.<eos> I ran and I cried underneath the bleachers.<eos> They bothered me every day, because they knew I was too afraid to face them.<eos> Until one day, I'd had enough.<eos> And I socked Jesse Hubbard right in the nose.<eos> Really?<eos> And they left you alone?
No.<eos> I won't, I won't!<eos> Thank you!<eos> I feel like you've already gotten your hopes up.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - You calling your mother?<eos> - No!<eos> Okay, yes, but it's about something else.<eos> It's not about something else.<eos> Damn it, Brad, he set you up.
Then let's go.<eos> - But I look terrible.<eos> - Yeah, you do.<eos> Come here.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I'm fixing you up, man.<eos> Dusty, get your hands out of my pants.<eos> Calm down.<eos> Think I want to touch your little dinky?<eos> I'm trying to fix you up.
Notice anything strange about Frankie?<eos> Yeah, everything.<eos> Like the fact that she's obsessed with Italian culture or she has uneven nails or that she prefers gelato over Ben and Jerry's.<eos> What?<eos> No I mean anything that I would consider strange.<eos> That's not strange?<eos> I'm not letting you go.<eos> Have to.<eos> Hey, there you are.<eos> I've been trying you all day.
Yes, alright already.<eos> Your hair is gonna rock.<eos> Hey.<eos> It's hard not to feel what you're feeling.<eos> What do you know about it?<eos> Not much.<eos> Enough to know that the more you try and hide something, the worse it is when it comes out.<eos> I am never going to forgive you.<eos> Okay.<eos> But I'm never gonna stop loving you, no matter what.
Ben Rickert.<eos> Ben, why do you do that, man? I mean...<eos> You're a retired trader, okay?<eos> No one is listening to your calls.<eos> The NSA has a $52 billion budget and the ability to monitor tens of millions of calls a second. You think they're not using it?<eos> Hey, I promise I will refrain from saying<eos> "Ben Rickert" and "dirty bomb" in the same sent...<eos> - I'm sorry, dude.<eos> Ben Rickert.<eos> Did you get a chance to look at what we sent you, Ben?
Our nightmare ends with a miracle.<eos> Help him.<eos> It's her heart.<eos> When we destroy it, we destroy her.<eos> End it, brother Dolan.<eos> Destroy her, Dolan!<eos> You kept it.<eos> It's over.<eos> The Witch Queen is dead.<eos> They betrayed you from the start.
Until now.<eos> I am reborn.<eos> Your race has always been frightened.<eos> Hiding in caves.<eos> Huddling around fire.<eos> Hey, kid.<eos> I was afraid I was too late.<eos> I hope I don't look as rough as you do.<eos> Okay.<eos> I killed the one who cursed you.
Yeah.<eos> A spot of wine?<eos> For you, I'm fine.<eos> - Lena? - Doug.<eos> You crazy?<eos> My parents are right downstairs.<eos> How'd you even get in?<eos> Construction entrance.<eos> Promise me you'll stay with me, no matter what.<eos> What did he do to you?
If you... promise me it'll be OK, I'll call them.<eos> It's too risky to try handling this myself, right?<eos> Doug, what do I do?<eos> Oh, your pulse, it's racing.<eos> We just have to think straight, alright? We gotta stay calm.<eos> The most important thing, right now, is to act normal.<eos> That means I go to work, I go home, I come back later.<eos> Don't talk to anyone. Don't touch him.<eos> Don't do anything. When I get back, we'll figure this out, OK?<eos> What's wrong with you tonight, man?
So, she's no longer a suspect? Supposedly, there's a rape kit she'd done, about a month ago, up to Raleigh Medical Center.<eos> This guy had a hood on, it was dark, so she couldn't identify him.<eos> DNA match from the blood that we lifted from the window.<eos> Hold still, please.<eos> Stalker shattered it when he broke in that night and stole some undergarments.<eos> Her underwear? !<eos> Oh, my God, and all of this has been happening right next door?<eos> Just relax. We think the stalker's gotta be linked to the murder.<eos> Open wide.<eos> Just gotta gas up and I'll get you on over to the Rudder, Dougie.
I'm sorry. I've been lying, this whole time, to you, Carson.<eos> It was a shitty thing to do. Hey, it's OK.<eos> Plus, I've been, uh... I've been lying to you, too.<eos> Been banging' yo momma.<eos> Kidding.<eos> OK, go get Jack.<eos> - Hi there, Dougie.<eos> - Hey. - Come set a spell.<eos> - OK.<eos> Say, Lem told me that that lady rode you pretty hard.
Good night.<eos> Whoever he is, he has got one hell of an excuse.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to scare you.<eos> Just once from a young king-cross bee type.<eos> You heard that before.<eos> Happy New Year.<eos> I'm too old for this. Oh no!<eos> Don't disappear.<eos> I'll call you tomorrow.
May I have a moment alone with him, please?<eos> Of course.<eos> Hey Jenny!<eos> This is Ellis.<eos> I tried you coupla times.<eos> Hope you got my messages.<eos> Call me back.<eos> Jenny!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I tried to call you, but...
Come on, in.<eos> Want something to eat?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I made cheesecake.<eos> We're kinda tired actually.<eos> I think we'll head up, if that's OK with you?<eos> Me too.<eos> Really?<eos> Alright.<eos> I'll have you in the back bedroom.
That's beautiful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Three weeks later his semester completed...<eos> William flew home to, The United States.<eos> Adaline, came with him.<eos> Hey.<eos> How'd you sleep?<eos> Fine.<eos> Good.<eos> Sorry about last night, I'll never embarrass you, its just...
Everything OK?<eos> No, no... I just wanted to tell you...<eos> What is it?<eos> You're right.<eos> No more running.<eos> Mom?<eos> I'll call you tomorrow, okay?<eos> I am so happy to hear that.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you too.
Jenny?<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey!<eos> I know why you ran away.<eos> You do?<eos> That's because of what I said to you last night, wasn't it?<eos> I told you, I loved you.<eos> And you got scared...<eos> Come here, I love you.<eos> I love you too.
My God.<eos> What happened?<eos> Nothing, nothing.<eos> An accident, I'm fine okay.<eos> I'm better than fine.<eos> Okay?<eos> This is Ellis.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hello.<eos> He's the man, I've been telling you about.
But sorrow can come to any kingdom, no matter how happy.<eos> And so it came to Ella's home.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Thank you, Doctor.<eos> This must have been very difficult for you.<eos> Come.<eos> Ella.<eos> Ella, my darling.<eos> I want to tell you a secret.<eos> A great secret that will see you through all the trials that life can offer.
I miss her.<eos> Do you?<eos> Very much.<eos> Remember the lace!<eos> I simply must have it!<eos> And my parasol! For my complexion! That means skin, if you don't know!<eos> Bye!<eos> Bye. Ella!<eos> I love you!<eos> I love you, too!
And I took it up myself.<eos> Cinderella at the ball!<eos> No one wants a servant for a bride.<eos> After all I've done...<eos> I don't want to ruin anything.<eos> I don't even want to meet the prince.<eos> And you won't, because there's no question of your going.<eos> But, all of the maidens of the land are invited, by order of the king.<eos> It is the king I am thinking of.<eos> It would be an insult to the royal personage to take you to the palace dressed in these old rags.
On foot?<eos> It'll be winter before we get there.<eos> Unless we come across a post, trade for some horses.<eos> Ain't no posts that far over!<eos> Captain, losing this boat is a goddamn mistake.<eos> The Ree ain't that stupid.<eos> We keep it, we can lay it up around Arrow's Peak.<eos> Quit acting like you know what you're talking about.<eos> Ain't nobody talking to you.<eos> Who'd listen to you anyway?
Yeah, excuse me.<eos> It's just that stands for Designated Ugly Fat Friend, dick face.<eos> You can't take it literally, okay?<eos> I mean, the DUFF doesn't actually have to be fat or ugly.<eos> You know, like Tony Romo, he's a Dallas Cowboy. It's not like he rides a horse, right?<eos> I have no idea what the hell you're talking about.<eos> I'm just saying, I would never call anyone fat or ugly.<eos> Okay? That's messed up.<eos> But it's the word and it stuck. It's a catchall.<eos> Oh, my God. Get out of here before I murder you.
Lighting matters, okay?<eos> The darker the booth, the better.<eos> Lighting, dark booth. Got it.<eos> What's next?<eos> Body language.<eos> Is he leaning in?<eos> - Is he sitting close?<eos> - I don't know...<eos> And then it's all about interaction.<eos> Is he trying to impress you?
- who videotape everything.<eos> - Oh, here we go.<eos> Well, you don't.<eos> Ever been kicked in the nuts?<eos> Oh, God, you always come back with that.<eos> - Hey, B.<eos> - Madison, how are you?<eos> Do you wanna see something hysterical?<eos> Watch this.<eos> Did you see the way that guy looked at you?
Did you see the way that guy looked at you?<eos> - This part's the best.<eos> - Definitely not.<eos> Wait, just look at your face.<eos> Ha, ha. Oh, don't worry, um, it's a working title.<eos> You know, I was thinking maybe "retail slut" or just "slut whore."<eos> You thought the first video was bad.<eos> Boy, this one's gonna destroy you.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Oh, I think it's adorable that Wesley indulged you in a pity make-out.
Yeah, well, I hope I wasn't naked.<eos> Nope, your baby mama gave birth to Pete Dinklage.<eos> You're not related to him, are you?<eos> Who is that?<eos> You got a girl there, e?<eos> What do you want, Ari?<eos> Big titties?<eos> Tight ass?<eos> Give me something I can use in the office.<eos> I can hear you. You're disgusting.
Huh?<eos> Mm.<eos> Yeah, it just came up on the screen.<eos> "I want your cock." From Melanie.<eos> Wow, that's, uh... Classy.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's not my business.<eos> Sloan?<eos> Oh. Coming.<eos> Okay, let me help you up.
To get back to my conversation...<eos> So, you're a "viking quest" fan, huh?<eos> How long have you lived here?<eos> Just a couple of months.<eos> It came with all the furniture and stuff, so it feels lived-in.<eos> So, what's your deal, turtle?<eos> You selling coke these days?<eos> No.<eos> Why... why would you say that?<eos> I say that 'cause the last time I saw you, you were a fat pothead living off of Vince.
And why do you always have to be so fucking honest?<eos> 'Cause that's just who I am.<eos> And I guess that's why we're not together.<eos> No.<eos> We're not together 'cause you fucked my stepmother.<eos> Don't ever forget that.<eos> And you told me that If I came clean and admitted it, you'd get over it, so don't forget that.<eos> I tried, Eric.<eos> I mean, I didn't move to New York 'cause I really wanted to try... I did.<eos> I'll talk to you later.
Yeah, of course.<eos> Hi. How are you?<eos> Good.<eos> It's funny running into you here.<eos> I wanted to talk to you today, but we didn't even exchange numbers.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Do you mind If I sit for a minute?<eos> Uh, you know, actually, I have a meeting right now.<eos> Is there any way I can, uh, I can call you later?
I would've banged her.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> Wife might even give me a pass for her.<eos> Ah, fuck him.<eos> No, seriously.<eos> Fuck him.<eos> All right, we don't need him.<eos> I'll put up the $8 million we need.<eos> How much fuckin' money did this guy make?<eos> Vin, I'm serious, and It's not just 'cause I love you.
I will figure this out.<eos> Put fear to the side, for fear will conquer you.<eos> Om.<eos> I will let no man see the darkness inside of me.<eos> Om.<eos> I will learn how to stop this fucking phone from overtaking my fucking calming cd!<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> About the wedding, Ari.<eos> Lloyd, I've got bigger problems than who's gonna give you away at your big fat gay wedding.
That's why I have succeeded, and that's why you will.<eos> Oh, and, Ari?<eos> What?<eos> I love you.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Fuck, fuck, fuck!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Still time to leave.<eos> I don't think she saw you yet.
You're kidding.<eos> Name?<eos> Ryan.<eos> Ryan Murphy?<eos> Yeah, you like it?<eos> Well, I read for the teacher on "glee"<eos> six times and didn't get it.<eos> But, yeah, I like it!<eos> Piers Morgan?<eos> What the fuck is piers Morgan calling you for?
You should know this. I mean, what do you expect?<eos> Some respect, for instance?<eos> I look at pictures of your mother, Tommy.<eos> And no matter how hard I try I can't remember what it was that we had together.<eos> Dad, please.<eos> Hadn't you been around, we'd have split up.<eos> - So it's my fault?<eos> - I never said that.<eos> I don't know why you speak so bitterly about her. Bitter?<eos> Was she unfaithful to you, is that it?
- Hi, Lore How's the leg?<eos> - Same as always Will you stay with your folks now?<eos> Looks like it<eos> They need you urgently<eos> You have to register within 48 hours, that's now the law<eos> I won't stay longer than four weeks<eos> - Still - All you can think of is supervising<eos> Hi, Elmar<eos> My dad says Lore shouldn't act like a big shot, she's with a Jew from Heidenheim<eos> Who turned you into a moron all of a sudden?
Calm down Let's stay calm<eos> Schurr, you'll be the first to be strung up once we seize power<eos> And you'll be shot after the revolution<eos> Idiots<eos> You've been to Konstanz and Switzerland? - Yes<eos> - Did you go to the cinema there?<eos> I saw a picture of Jacqueline Wells in a magazine<eos> She's so beautiful in "Tarzan the Fearless"<eos> They say she's wearing hardly anything in that film<eos> That would interest you, of course
What the hell are you doing here?<eos> - Don't I get a kiss?<eos> - Please go away.<eos> That wouldn't be fair to you, Cath. This is a wonderful opportunity for you to get to know the real me.<eos> Well... I'm calling security.<eos> No, not just the charming, high-flying military strategist.<eos> Hello, security?<eos> Not the inventor of extreme rendition, either.<eos> Yes, I've got an intruder in room 405.<eos> Or the mastermind behind warrantless domestic surveillance. Just a humble officer who adores you.
- What bitch?<eos> The bitch you were shagging last night.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> She's not a bitch, okay?<eos> She's a lovely human female. And we weren't just shagging. Right.<eos> Come to think of it, I wouldn't mind shagging your leg right now.<eos> A little leg dance, huh?<eos> Just above the sock. - Ah...<eos> - How about it? Come on, Daddy.<eos> I thought I turned you into a rational, thinking creature.
Just above the sock. - Ah...<eos> - How about it? Come on, Daddy.<eos> I thought I turned you into a rational, thinking creature.<eos> Rational, thinking creatures still have desires.<eos> Oh, well, we can soon deal with that.<eos> - No, no, don't take my desires away from me.<eos> - Why not?<eos> They're what makes my life worth living. Biscuits, shagging.<eos> I don't think I like your conversation.<eos> But I worship you, master. I love you so much.
Thank you, Dennis.<eos> Catherine!<eos> Um, me be on the bus.<eos> I don't mean on the bus.<eos> I mean in the bus.<eos> Not in the engine. In the passenger accommodation!<eos> Catherine!<eos> - You've gotta stop Miss Pringle.<eos> She's set up shrines all over the school. There's even a website.<eos> Look, you wanted her to worship you, okay?
-Shit.<eos> -Carter, give me your lighter.<eos> Here.<eos> Are you guys ready?<eos> -Wait!<eos> -What?<eos> I need to say something.<eos> Ben, it's fine.<eos> -You don't have to do this.<eos> We should have never ditched you tonight, Augie.
- Sorry to hear that.<eos> He wants me to leave you.<eos> And you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know what's going to happen.<eos> I wanted to meet up with you and talk about it.<eos> - Don't smoke in here, please. He doesn't like it.<eos> -Who?<eos> The parrot. He's old.<eos> When the police called the house, when they were looking for you, I was so worried something had happened to you.
Ghazala?<eos> You really are a dumb son of a bitch, Siefert!<eos> Is that how cases get buried 'round here?<eos> You find the nearest Muslim and you ring him up!<eos> You're protecting someone, Siefert, and you're gonna tell me who it is!<eos> Who are you protecting?<eos> Just let me up! Let me up, will ya?<eos> Come on.<eos> Jesus God.<eos> I was just trying to point you away from someone.
Wait...<eos> Are you the guys who took my comic book?<eos> Yeah, fuckhead.<eos> I'm the guy that took your comic book.<eos> Carolyn Cobb.<eos> I think you raped her and killed her, Pac-Man.<eos> Yeah, that would be smart, 'cause I don't have enough heat on me as it is, do I?<eos> So...<eos> I think you met her at the picnic, convinced yourself that she was interested in you, and then maybe after a couple of days following her around, you went up to her, declared your undying love,<eos> and when she told you to piss off, you raped her and killed her and dumped her body in the trash, doused in bleach.
This is Africa.<eos> Where are all the men?<eos> It is a little lonely in the desert.<eos> It is also lonely among men.<eos> You are a funny animal.<eos> You are no thicker than a finger.<eos> But I am more powerful than the finger of a king.<eos> You haven't any feet.<eos> You cannot even travel.<eos> I can carry you further than any ship could take you.

Here, we take a more accelerated approach to growing up.<eos> Isn't that right, Mr Prince?<eos> No, never mind.<eos> Those blank eyes, you've forgotten everything, haven't you?<eos> Now, you're going to feel a slight pinch.<eos> Just relax.<eos> Please sign there.<eos> A consent form releasing myself, the Businessman, - and the corporation from all liability... - Help!<eos> ...in case of accidental death or dismemberment during the centralising process.<eos> I'm trying to help you!
But I don't buy that end of the world nonsense.<eos> Look at him.<eos> I've been looking and it looks like he's telling the truth.<eos> It may not end. It may simply change.<eos> But we will all suffer.<eos> Suffer? Have you seen where we're sitting?<eos> - It's time for a revolution.<eos> - No, it ain't.<eos> So... we in the south is doing some real bad stuff, and the sun got ticked and is coming down to bust heads.<eos> Now some dead dude is dreaming all this, leaving your people to send you here to warn the President.
We're not going anywhere.<eos> But I'm going away.<eos> Where you going?<eos> Where?<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - Who?<eos> Whoever you were just in bed with. That's who.<eos> Danny, I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Come on, Sophie.<eos> I didn't pull in the way I usually do, so the kid outside couldn't call you and stall me.
- Samantha, Hope and the baby...<eos> - They'll be taken care of, Tom.<eos> - Don't even think about it.<eos> - Okay. Okay. Good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I am not ready to leave them.<eos> I'm not ready.<eos> You know, Tom, I've been thinking.<eos> I noticed something very interesting.<eos> Whenever this doctor comes in here, he either calls you Mr. Donnelly or Tom.
- Okay. Okay. Good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I am not ready to leave them.<eos> I'm not ready.<eos> You know, Tom, I've been thinking.<eos> I noticed something very interesting.<eos> Whenever this doctor comes in here, he either calls you Mr. Donnelly or Tom.<eos> You notice that?<eos> Always one or the other.<eos> Now, when he calls you Mr. Donnelly, it's never good news.

Remember that?<eos> He calls you Tom.<eos> It's here, I've been taking notes.<eos> Literally, every time, it's a good thing when he calls you Tom.
You understand?<eos> So let's...<eos> Let's focus...<eos> On that.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Everything's going to be all right, son.<eos> It's going to be all right.<eos> You promise?<eos> Have I ever let you down before?
and she gave me a look, like...<eos> You know that look Mommy gives, like...<eos> "You're in big trouble."<eos> And then I came out?<eos> Then you came out, yep.<eos> And then they spanked me?<eos> Well, they spank all little babies 'cause they're trying to get them to cry.<eos> - But she didn't?<eos> - She wasn't crying.<eos> So they spanked you again.
You need to tell her to breathe because she knows your voice."<eos> "Loud."<eos> - "Say it to her."<eos> - So I started yelling,<eos> "Breathe, Lucy.<eos> "Breathe, little Lucy, please."<eos> And then I did?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And then you did.<eos> Then I brought you over to Mommy, and she held you for the first time, and I said,
You go back to the fuckin' shelter.<eos> You smell like the fuckin' third floor of the shelter.<eos> Yeah, we back... we back in the dressing room now, yeah.<eos> The Commission in here.<eos> They... wrap... watch-watching 'em wrap Billy hands.<eos> Yeah, it's all right.<eos> Yeah, but once he gets in the inside, it's over.<eos> Make that step, it's over.<eos> Yeah. I'll text you as soon as he's done, okay?<eos> Yeah. I love you, too.
What do you want me to do?<eos> Why do you do this in front of all...<eos> What happened?<eos> - What's the problem, Billy?<eos> - Hey, yo, yo, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry about that.<eos> - I'll just... - Don't worry about it. Go on.<eos> - Just, come on, man.<eos> - Don't worry about this.<eos> I want to get you out of this dress.
Why are you looking at me like I'm crazy?<eos> 'Cause you asked me to get her the phone?<eos> - Get a ten-year-old a phone?<eos> - Out, out, out.<eos> Do you have the pass code on it?<eos> Dad would say yes.<eos> Well, sometimes I think your daddy confuses you with the other children who hang around him night and day.<eos> You're talking about Mikey and Jon Jon, right?<eos> That's right, baby.<eos> Mm... I love you so much.
I'm not gonna watch this. I'm not gonna watch this happen to you, man.<eos> I'm not gonna watch this happen to us.<eos> Billy, if you don't show me something here, I'm gonna call it. That's it.<eos> You hear me?<eos> We're done. Wake up, champ.<eos> Don't call it, man. No, don't call it.<eos> What the fuck are we doing here, huh?<eos> I gotta end this shit, Billy.<eos> You hear me?<eos> I'm not gonna watch this shit happen to you, man, all right?
- I'm sorry! - ...and so much joyous glory, appears to have ended ignominiously here tonight.<eos> Eli?<eos> Eli?<eos> Is Jordan here?<eos> Is anybody still here?<eos> You headbutt a referee, man.<eos> What the fuck kind of shit was that, man?<eos> Broke his nose.<eos> Shattered his motherfucking cheekbone.<eos> What got into you, man?
Listen... you're gonna have to sell the house to cover the debt.<eos> No, I don't wanna sell the house, man.<eos> I'm not selling the house.<eos> - That's Leila's home.<eos> - You don't have a choice, Billy.<eos> If you don't, it's gonna get repossessed anyway.<eos> - This is some serious shit.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> I'll just train with Eli and then we'll get ready for the next fight.<eos> I'm not even sure trainers will take you on right now.
- I just... - I just didn't want to go home.<eos> 300 square feet of... nothing, you know?<eos> You got plans?<eos> Uh, um, what you mean by that?<eos> You know what you're gonna do with all this training that you think you so desperately need?<eos> What you gonna do with it?<eos> I'm gonna fight, and then I'm gonna get my kid back.<eos> Then you're gonna end up right back here?<eos> - What are you saying?<eos> - What do you think got you here?
We start tomorrow.<eos> What, like training?<eos> No, baking cookies.<eos> I'm going to the bar.<eos> I do not want to see you there.<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> A'ight.<eos> Shining so bright.<eos> The way you fight... anger's your biggest tool.<eos> Fighting angry, that drains you twice as fast.
Six weeks?<eos> You know what that's about, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - He's gonna sell it like it's a-a revenge match around the murder of your wife.<eos> Yeah, it'll all be about Mo.<eos> You're not considering it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got to make some money, man.<eos> I can't lose my girl.<eos> This man right here... You fell down to the ground, he just stepped right over you.
Look.<eos> Someone's giving you the stink eye.<eos> Looking for something, Little Boy?<eos> Maybe this.<eos> It's a magic list, right?<eos> Give it back.<eos> Please.<eos> You fat motherless pig!<eos> Freddy, Freddy, Freddy.<eos> This'll teach you to never mess with me.
You can move a mountain.<eos> Get the kid home, London.<eos> Fine.<eos> You want to move a mountain? There's one.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Move it.<eos> Move it!<eos> Move it for everyone!<eos> You don't have to do it.<eos> He's just trying to humiliate you.
I don't know. I guess...<eos> I sort of... I wanted to...<eos> Like, impress you.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's so sweet.<eos> - Why would you want to impress me?<eos> - What?<eos> I said, why would you want to impress me?<eos> Lorelei, I think I might be in love with you.
They share brains.<eos> Now, what's it like being a zombie?<eos> Do you get sad?<eos> Basically, I eat brains.<eos> - And it tastes yummy.<eos> - That must be nice.<eos> Think fast, you zombie fuck!<eos> So, that didn't even bother you?<eos> - What?<eos> - That asshole just hit you with a slushee.
I mean, I wouldn't want you to die a virgin.<eos> Sex.<eos> We'll go to my house to have sex.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Milan, hey.<eos> - Just give us a second, babe.<eos> - Okay. We'll be by the car.<eos> What? Hey!<eos> I think there's something wrong with your phone.<eos> I've been trying you all night.
- I don't mean to impose.<eos> - Shut your mouth.<eos> - I'll cut your tongue out.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Don't count drugs in front of the kid.<eos> I gotta get this shit done.<eos> By the time I finish, you'd better be gone.<eos> Okay. Absolutely.<eos> Listen to me, I'm your maker.<eos> I brought you into this world, okay?
When you get back in, start paying rent, right?<eos> What is this, Amerika?<eos> - Hey, Chappie, come. Jump out.<eos> - Chappie doesn't want to. Come, Chappie.<eos> Come. Come, come, come.<eos> - It's a cop!<eos> - Hey, I'm going to go.<eos> - Welcome to the real world.<eos> - I don't like this real world.<eos> We gotta toughen you up for the heist.
I hate you!<eos> - My arm is gone, Mommy.<eos> Don't we have those arms, those legs, that shit in the back?<eos> - Do you think you can fix...?<eos> Chappie, let me just get some of this dirt off you.<eos> Chappie, who did this?<eos> A man.<eos> In a van.<eos> A man in a van?<eos> - Did he put you in the van? - Yeah.
What does that say there?<eos> "Low battery."<eos> Battery, power, energy supply.<eos> I need a new battery.<eos> That battery's stuck. It's melted together.<eos> That battery can't come out.<eos> What you gonna do...<eos> - ...when that battery runs out? - I die?<eos> Chappie die?<eos> Deon, he put you in a broken body.
I just.... I want to remember.<eos> All I care about is that they find Michelle.<eos> And... And that she's alive.<eos> So tell me. How did you get inside the house?<eos> - Oh my god, this place is awesome.<eos> - Alright.<eos> Shut off your phones, so I can read the house.<eos> - John, are you okay? - Why?<eos> - You're bleeding. - What? Your nose is bleeding.<eos> - Does that happened to you a lot?
Something that screwed up...<eos> Who you are. How people see you.<eos> It's not something that you bring up. It's something you pray people don't find out about.<eos> So.<eos> - Bryan, how did you find out?<eos> - I do my homework, John.<eos> I had to do a whole lot of searching on the internet to find out that the one survivor ... Sarah Matthews had a son who... wait for it.<eos> Whose name is John Mitchell. So my mother was here, the night of the murders. So what?<eos> Look. I understand why you wouldn't want people to know about this. Alright, I do.<eos> But if it was her who brought you back here? To communicate.
Jump on my bush joke.<eos> I just made that up!<eos> Put another Jenga on it.<eos> I bet working on other people's bushes really makes you wanna whack your weeds.<eos> That was dirtier than I thought. I'm sorry.<eos> That got dirty really fast.<eos> Don't apologize, I like that.<eos> I actually own this house.<eos> You live here with your wife?<eos> Your wife's a bitch for not helping you.
- Hey.<eos> Listen, your mom forgot to tell you the most important part, which is that she got a job out here at a very fancy nail salon.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Try something on.<eos> So I think maybe you should come here earlier next week, and surprise her.<eos> She really misses you.<eos> Aunt Maura, I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Haley, I know I said that I was going to help you for a while, but now you have to get back with your mother.
Can you fix the damage for that?<eos> No.<eos> But I'll help you do it.<eos> Is Maura still in town?<eos> No.<eos> I thought you flew to Atlanta.<eos> I didn't wanna leave town until I said I was sorry.<eos> And I think I melted my driver's license in the microwave the other night.<eos> I'm sorry, Kate.<eos> I'm sorry that I didn't tell you that Haley was with me.
I blew it with him.<eos> No, he's still asking about you.<eos> - He is?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He is the greatest.<eos> James just needs some...<eos> No!<eos> Stop deciding what other people need.<eos> You need help.<eos> Let him help you.
The nurses told me.<eos> Those nurses talk too much.<eos> I have a real New York cop in front of me.<eos> Wow!<eos> Listen, kid, you seem nice, but I'm not in the mood.<eos> Wait, don't we know each other?<eos> I feel as though we've met before.<eos> I'm on the fifth floor.<eos> I came down as soon as I knew there was a cop.<eos> I'm sure I've seen you before.
- Right hand, Mole, or I'll lock you up.<eos> - All right, I swear.<eos> - He did it.<eos> I'm looking for the man with the broken face.<eos> You've seen him on TV.<eos> The guy who wants to blow up the computers?<eos> He's a big shot.<eos> I know he's somewhere in the port with a dog and a giant.<eos> I need you to find his hideout.<eos> A journalist will help you. You'll treat her with respect and get me the info before midnight.
I knew one of them.<eos> Steven.<eos> I didn't like him much, but...<eos> I don't think he deserved to die.<eos> Does it hurt?<eos> No. Not anymore.<eos> Why do we have to stay with Aunt Linda?<eos> Because I'm contagious.<eos> Mom's afraid we'll get it.<eos> Just because she loves you.
No.<eos> No.<eos> You don't do that and then leave.<eos> You don't send half of them home to their families and hope they come back to be killed.<eos> You just kill them.<eos> That's all.<eos> Mag!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Your finger!<eos> Come on, I've got you.
Hey, uh, hold on real quick.<eos> - What?<eos> - Here. I found it on the couch the other day and threw it on this old thing.<eos> I figured you might wanna wear it.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Oh, it's nothing.<eos> Go, get out of here before Allie explodes.<eos> Yeah, I know, right?<eos> We are late.<eos> And you have a nice young man waiting for you.
I'm gonna see you again this weekend, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I promise.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I'm going to hold you to it.<eos> Yeah, when don't you?<eos> Hey, wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> I love you, okay?<eos> I love you, too.
It's really good. You saving yours?<eos> No, that's for Mike.<eos> I can't ever eat those things, they are kinda depressing.<eos> I know.<eos> Did you see the numbers from Washington?<eos> Yeah, very interesting.<eos> I'm not asking if the PD is lying, I know they're lying. All I'm asking who's behind it?<eos> Ok, I get it, you don't wanna talk.<eos> No Dan, I'm not mad, I'm hungry.<eos> I've been talking to you so long I didn't eat lunch.
The bakery didn't survive.<eos> It's Katniss.<eos> - It's because of Katniss.<eos> - Wasn't because of her.<eos> - She tell you to say that?<eos> - She didn't tell me anything.<eos> She's a liar, Prim.<eos> It's a trick.<eos> Peeta, what you're saying isn't real.<eos> She sent you here to talk to me.
No problem.<eos> I can't sleep.<eos> Yeah, I haven't slept in days, either.<eos> I should've volunteered to take your place in the first Games.<eos> No, you couldn't have.<eos> No, she never would have forgiven you.<eos> She needed you to be there and take care of her family and you did.<eos> She can't lose you.<eos> She really loves you.<eos> And the way she kissed you in the Quarter Quell.
- Even when you're out of range.<eos> Come on, what's the big deal?<eos> We're only going 20 light-years out.<eos> Now arriving, Spaceport.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Over here.<eos> Come on, please!<eos> I love you guys.<eos> You're going to make me cry in front of my friends, okay?<eos> Come on. We saved a seat just for you.
Casey, get up.<eos> They'll be coming.<eos> What?<eos> Who?<eos> - I don't know what... I can't get into... - I know, I know.<eos> Get in the car, Casey!<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> Just get in the car.<eos> What just happened?<eos> Two AA units targeted you for extermination.
Something highly unusual is happening, and...<eos> Okay. My point is... I'm fine.<eos> I'm not on drugs. I haven't joined a cult.<eos> I won't be gone long.<eos> And I will call again soon.<eos> I love you, Dad.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yes. Fine, thank you.<eos> I thought I broke you or something.
She ditched me here.<eos> Of course she did.<eos> Look, wherever you came from, kid, go back.<eos> No, I want you to take me there.<eos> What I saw...<eos> What you saw is gone.<eos> This, what you're looking for, it doesn't exist anymore. No.<eos> I feel like I have to go. Like I'm supposed to go.<eos> Why?<eos> Because they're saving a seat on the rocket ship just for you?
I would want you to tell me.<eos> - But I wouldn't believe you.<eos> - You have to believe me.<eos> Why? Don't we, like, make our own destiny and stuff?<eos> What?<eos> Who are you, kid?<eos> Is that bad?<eos> Hell.<eos> Hell!<eos> - They followed you here?
Are we at van't Hoff?<eos> Good to go!<eos> Good.<eos> You set it for the Tower?<eos> There is still a receiver there?<eos> - Last I checked.<eos> - How long ago was that?<eos> 25 years ago.<eos> Roughly.<eos> They threw you out, too?
That's not The Monitor's fault. That's yours.<eos> Put them through.<eos> Thanks for visiting, Frank.<eos> It was genuinely nice to see you again.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Not giving up.<eos> Look out!<eos> - Get the thing!<eos> - What thing?<eos> The thing I gave you when we first got here!
Please, my momma needs me.<eos> - Take it easy, kid.<eos> - Do you know where the river is?<eos> What river?<eos> There's tons of rivers around these parts.<eos> By Clawtooth Mountain. It has three points.<eos> Don't know that one.<eos> We're heading south to a watering hole.<eos> Come with us.<eos> Someone there might help you.
- Are you trying to kill me?<eos> - Don't say that<eos> Then leave me alone<eos> Your pity has no hope of placating my anger<eos> Are you in love with her, then?<eos> - No<eos> - She's much prettier<eos> Shut up, I don't<eos> You love her, curse you<eos> That wicked woman has taken you away from me
I'll make sure no one leaves.<eos> Come on!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Hey, Jose, there's been a collapse in the mine.<eos> They're locking us down.<eos> I'm calling the news.<eos> Nobody out!<eos> Wait, Don Jose!<eos> Stay here.<eos> I'll call you later. No!
We know.<eos> We know it's unstable, but it's the only way.<eos> We're all ready to get out of here.<eos> Or die trying.<eos> Alex!<eos> Mario!<eos> We're going to bolster the beam with these timbers, here.<eos> The charges will be placed here, correlating to this.<eos> Jessi.<eos> I'll take you to the hospital.
It's misdirection. That's what they call it.<eos> A case of psychic misdirection.<eos> Anyway, sorry.<eos> You both look great together.<eos> He takes very good care of you. No, I mean it.<eos> He does.<eos> You look fantastic.<eos> You both look amazing.<eos> Wonderful, wonderful to see you.<eos> And you know, this invalid thing, it suits you.
This is not going to work. Forget about it.<eos> Jesus Christ! Too hot for white people.<eos> You're pretty domesticated for a rock star.<eos> You were with Harry for what, six years?<eos> And you've been with Paul for how long?<eos> Cool.<eos> I heard that there used to be six songs on either side of a record album.<eos> You'd hear six and then you'd have to flip the thing over to hear more.<eos> [Have I done...? ]<eos> [Have I done something to upset you? ]
I am so sorry.<eos> Sir, we have received a call from the British regarding an operation.<eos> Why are you wasting my time referring this to me?<eos> No, his citizenship does not protect him.<eos> By joining Al-Shabaab he has declared himself an enemy of the United States.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Tell the British, if they really do have two, four, and five on the East Africa list in their sights. They have our full support to strike. Yes, all three are on the President's list.<eos> Okay, let us go!<eos> Yeah!<eos> I am going to get you, Jian.
They got it!<eos> That guy, he's snaking the wave!<eos> You're gonna get somebody killed, man!<eos> What's going on?<eos> So, the old train station in Paris, tomorrow night.<eos> You gonna jump in this time?<eos> I'm still hurting from the last one.<eos> - You're the guy I snaked, right?<eos> - Yup.<eos> And the one who plucked you off the ocean floor.
- Having fun?<eos> - Yeah, man.<eos> Good.<eos> You, too?<eos> Hey, how come I don't know you?<eos> Big world.<eos> Why would you?<eos> Big wave rider like you?<eos> I watch YouTube.<eos> I just never seen you.
That was some crazy, crazy shit.<eos> For that, I thank you.<eos> There's gotta be something there, Pappas.<eos> All I saw was the bottom of my glass.<eos> And a great piece of ass.<eos> You?<eos> I just know there's gotta be a lotta guys on that boat who are chasing The Eight.<eos> You got evidence that connects them to our investigation?<eos> You've got nothing.<eos> I'm takin' you to the airport.
Man, check out what my boys were doing in Mumbai.<eos> Good to see you, man.<eos> In Mumbai?<eos> The three parachutes?<eos> - I know, I know. I gotta go...<eos> - Don't go!<eos> I'll be back in one minute.<eos> I'll be back, just wait.<eos> Hey, Utah!<eos> Hey, it's my pleasure to have you here.
I need to finish it.<eos> Pap, can we get him in?<eos> Yeah, it could be done.<eos> - Hey. This it? - Si.<eos> Try not to get yourself killed, kid.<eos> Bodhi, I can't see the line.<eos> Nothing.<eos> I do.<eos> I do see it, and it's beautiful.<eos> You know I always trusted you, right?
True<eos> But even the surveillance team was in a clean sweep in this mission<eos> Do not we have ..<eos> The girl in the brain there's only food alone ... add, please<eos> How can you eat at a time like this?<eos> Sorry, Miss<eos> Not enough farmland<eos> But I was given to know there is work not hungry<eos> You're naive?<eos> Your parents sold you to save rice
Obviously...<eos> Let me say this.<eos> Obviously, Daniel didn't think he was doing anything wrong.<eos> By talking to Time about it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't know what that means.<eos> You said, when you told me the story. . . You said, you said to Dan,<eos> "Did Time magazine ask you if I had a daughter named Lisa?"<eos> And Dan said, "Yeah."<eos> My point was that he answered you simply and honestly because he didn't think he'd done anything wrong.
I don't know.<eos> No one's ever asked me that question.<eos> There you go.<eos> You're the only one who sees the world the same way I do.<eos> No one sees the world the same way you do.<eos> I'm like Julius Caesar, John.<eos> I'm surrounded by enemies.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> The board...<eos> Oh, "The board ." The board's behind you.
That came out of nowhere.<eos> "Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command.<eos> "Your old road is rapidly aging."<eos> So go fuck yourself, because my name is Steve Jobs, and "the times they are a-changing ."<eos> I don't feel rejected.<eos> - You're sure?<eos> - Very sure.<eos> Because it's not like the baby is born and the parents look and say,<eos> "Nah, we're not interested in this one."<eos> On the other hand, someone did choose you.
He didn't beat the living shit out of you?<eos> That's right.<eos> No, he said,<eos> "The musicians play their instruments.<eos> "I play the orchestra."<eos> That feels like something that sounds good, but doesn't mean anything.<eos> Markkula, Sculley. They ask you to slag me off in the press?<eos> I had reason to be angry.<eos> - Did they? - Absolutely not.<eos> But they asked you to talk.
Wait a minute. Are you saying you recommended terminating the Mac?<eos> Or you recommended taking me off the Mac team?<eos> We bought three spots in the Super Bowl.<eos> Two 30s and a 60.<eos> And after we screened it, the board wanted that money back, and they asked me to sell off the spots.<eos> Chiat/Day sold off the two 30s, but not the 60, and I let it be known to Lee Clow that if he didn't try very hard to sell the last spot, I wouldn't be unhappy.<eos> If we drop the price and double the budget...<eos> You can't drop the price or double the budget!<eos> I mean, the only way to do that is to take money out of the Apple II.<eos> The Apple II should embarrass you.
It embarrasses me.<eos> It doesn't embarrass the shareholders.<eos> I don't give a shit about the shareholders!<eos> That's why I hired you, so I don't ever have to hear about shareholders!<eos> The shareholders are my problem, and the board represents the shareholders!<eos> That's how it works!<eos> You sure it wasn't Lee Clow who dragged his feet selling the 60?<eos> At my direction, Steve.<eos> You think he would have done that on his own, taken it on himself?<eos> Yeah. I think he would've done what it took to save it from you.
And you said if I couldn't find a solution, you'd call me out in front of the audience.<eos> Did it say "hello"?<eos> It did.<eos> No need to thank me.<eos> Why do you want people to dislike you?<eos> I don't want people to dislike me.<eos> I'm indifferent to whether they dislike me.<eos> Since it doesn't matter, I always have.<eos> Really?<eos> I've always liked you a lot.
Okay, Martha.<eos> No, I'm gonna delete that one.<eos> Hey, what's up?<eos> "My girlfriend just sent me the sexiest photo."<eos> Oh, that looks like a butt.<eos> My boobs look like a butt?<eos> Just hanging' out in your favorite shirt and lingerie.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> None of these are good.<eos> I mean, was I cheating on you?
No, you're not suckball McGee.<eos> You know what? You're just a work in progress, babe.<eos> Oh, Sophie.<eos> Okay. Why don't you come to work with me tomorrow?<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You just chill. We can pet the cats.<eos> Love the cats!<eos> They love you.<eos> Yeah. I love you so much.
I'll finish the rest of the story.<eos> Okay. Okay?<eos> You look great.<eos> Hey.<eos> You the guy?<eos> I'm a guy, sure. Yeah.<eos> Everything's in there.<eos> Who's that guy?<eos> Where the fuck is Richie?<eos> Who hired you?
That's none of your business. Oh, yeah.<eos> Well, it's kind of my business.<eos> What do you mean Richie's not there?<eos> Fucking clown nose is supposed to kill him.<eos> Hector Garcia? Look at this guy.<eos> He looks like serpico.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You want me to kill Hector Garcia?<eos> That's a bit ambitious.<eos> You won't tell me who hired you to hire me to kill Hector Garcia?
- Vinnie, right?<eos> - It's Von, but don't... Yeah.<eos> You were the guy hiding under the table.<eos> It was my first big gunfight.<eos> It was scary.<eos> - Vinnie, what did I tell you?<eos> Stay out of trouble, right?<eos> - Stay out of trouble.<eos> This isn't staying out of trouble.<eos> I'm not the one that hired you.
Fuck you.<eos> All right, I'll find her myself. What?<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> - Aren't you gonna kill him?<eos> - What?<eos> - You know, do your thing with the thing that you do?<eos> - What?<eos> The hit man thing where they try to hire you and then you kill them out of some fucking misguided moral fucking purpose you have-- that crazy bullshit.
You're not helping them, White.<eos> What did you do that for?<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You just made the cross country team.<eos> I told you to stay away from my sister! Thomas, don't do that!<eos> Tommy, don't do that!<eos> And so did Thomas Valles.<eos> Do me a favor, Valles.<eos> Act a little happier.<eos> The coach just negotiated you out of a suspension.
The rage!<eos> ...inflicted upon myself...<eos> Oh Billy.<eos> I died.<eos> In a different way.<eos> I know you don't love me.<eos> I know things.<eos> - Say it.<eos> - Serious information.<eos> I've blinded you.
In a different way.<eos> I know you don't love me.<eos> I know things.<eos> - Say it.<eos> - Serious information.<eos> I've blinded you.<eos> My life has...<eos> I did every lousy, crappy job that they wanted me to do.<eos> But because I stumbled down the road like a drunk... that doesn't mean it's the wrong one.<eos> I turned you upside down.
Just do what you wanna do!<eos> Just go!<eos> Stay.<eos> I want you.<eos> Hold you.<eos> Have you. Mine.<eos> Are you sorry we didn't have babies?<eos> I am.<eos> Got started so late.<eos> You wanted me to help you through the dangers of a young man's life.
Do you think I'll be as famous as Elvis?<eos> What a fool am I?<eos> Just to lie in a stinking dungeon. When I may as well walk at liberty.<eos> I have a key in my bosom called promise.<eos> And will I am persuaded, open any lock in Doubting Castle.<eos> Though in this dark and dismal state, he hath turned the shadow of death into the morning,<eos> Go.<eos> Where?<eos> Find it.<eos> How do I reach you?
Well, this will be fun.<eos> Being trapped in a movie theater with a bunch of nerds.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> You know what was fun, though?<eos> Watching Chris today, ogle over you.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> - What?<eos> That's a word, right?<eos> Ogle?<eos> He likes you so much, it's so cute.
She's like a living nightmare.<eos> I can't believe you used to be friends with her.<eos> Look, she's probably gonna pee on him<eos> - just to mark her territory.<eos> - Gertie!<eos> Max!<eos> - Hey, hey, you came.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> All hail, Max!<eos> Sorry, I don't know why I worshipped you then, I'm just excited to see you.
The writing is so bad.<eos> Okay, tell you what. You find the keys and the van's yours.<eos> Really?<eos> - I'm glad that you die.<eos> - What?<eos> Nothing!<eos> What she meant to say was, that we all die eventually.<eos> Technically, we start dying the moment we're born.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> - Yes, but not to overwhelm you...
Well, we don't really have any other options. Okay?<eos> Look, we just have to get his machete into Max's hands so she can chop his head off, end the movie, and we can all go home.<eos> No. No way! I can't do this.<eos> See?<eos> She's even saying that she can't do it.<eos> Vicki!<eos> Enough!<eos> Jesus!<eos> Can you just shut up for a second?<eos> God! I can't believe I put up with you for so long.
And I missed you.<eos> I missed our friendship.<eos> And then you two became best friends and, I don't know, I got jealous.<eos> And so, I did some really bad things and I'm not proud of them.<eos> - Vicki.<eos> - No, no, no, just let me finish, okay.<eos> - I know that I've become a...<eos> - A bitch?<eos> Yes, thank you.<eos> But the thing is, Max, I've always looked up to you because you were always the brave one.
You're awake!<eos> When you get a second, try the pudding.<eos> - Wait, where are we?<eos> - We're home.<eos> - But was it a dream or...<eos> - No, not at all!<eos> Remember?<eos> That is a machete wound, poorly stitched by an incompetent doctor.<eos> I'm actually more concerned about tetanus because the machete had a bit of rust on it, and I did not see the doctor give me a shot.<eos> Duncan, I love you and I'm so happy you survived, but do you hear yourself
Remember, we are still leading two battles to one.<eos> One more loss for you will mean the annihilation your world.<eos> Good luck, and may the best planet win.<eos> You heard them.<eos> Let's get back to work.<eos> We've gotta get you guys ready for your next battle.<eos> Battle?<eos> Us?<eos> Huh? This is like a regular thing now?<eos> Remember when I told you you were meant for something more in life?
- I know what you need.<eos> You need the Fireblaster.<eos> Who is the Fireblaster?<eos> Me. That's my nickname, sugarbuns.<eos> Oh yeah, that's right, the one you made up for yourself.<eos> Yeah, who cares who made it up?<eos> It's totally tubular!<eos> See, this is why I don't think I can have Brenner on my team.<eos> He's just not really a gamer.<eos> Take out your bag of quarters, pick a game. I'll destroy you at it.
You have 5 minutes.<eos> And then what?<eos> WE... hunt you down.<eos> Help! Help me, please help me!<eos> - Oh, God!<eos> - Please God, save me!<eos> Save me! Isn't somebody gonna save me?<eos> - Will you stop?<eos> Can anyone save me?<eos> We're in the woods, nobody can hear you.
What?<eos> I have no idea, but name it and it's yours.<eos> Your life.<eos> No.<eos> Please, don't.<eos> Please don't.<eos> Have you ever noticed how people try to strike bargains with you, instead of just accepting their fate?<eos> Are you religious, Jamieson?<eos> No!<eos> - Are you gonna beg God to help you?
- Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah, of course I am.<eos> Totally cool. No problem at all.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow, then.<eos> - Okay. - Oh, and don't forget the bike key.<eos> - I won't.<eos> I got it. - Bye, Dad.<eos> I love you. - Okay.<eos> I love you, too, honey.
That's right, folks.<eos> And he's here playing a double bill with our very own Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie!<eos> Making his Birdland debut, Chet Baker and his quartet!<eos> It's going to be great. It's going to be great.<eos> - How do I look?<eos> - Perfect.<eos> Yeah, baby! Yeah!<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> - We love you, Chet!
This is extremely valuable, alright?<eos> This is a valve ring.<eos> Yeah, I will.<eos> It's the valve ring to the first trumpet my dad gave me.<eos> You can put it on a chain, you know?<eos> That way... you won't lose it.<eos> You're not gonna lose it, are you? No, I won't.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you, too.
Now, you say our friend Ham has passed?<eos> Love to hear how the three of you ended up playing house here, but... well, that's a tale for another time.<eos> Let's go see Jane.<eos> That your handiwork or mine?<eos> That's on you.<eos> Where is she?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Putting a bullet in your boyfriend!<eos> You're gonna shoot me in the back like the coward you are?<eos> It appears she's left you once again, Mr. Frost.
That looked disgusting!<eos> Why did the seagulls peck at it?<eos> Did they find it tasty?<eos> Well, it's just the kind of stuff they eat.<eos> That's why seagulls are so often on the seaside.<eos> Isee.<eos> Because there are often fish washed ashore... and when they are dead, they can peck at them.<eos> Isee.<eos> You're going to realize once you graduate from the next school<eos> what this school here meant yo you and what it brought you.
I'll teach you as soon as you get better.<eos> Shit!<eos> He didn't.<eos> Daddy!<eos> I knew it! I knew it!<eos> I knew it!<eos> Mom was crying every night, and I told her not to worry.<eos> I told her you'd come back.<eos> I love you, Daddy.<eos> I love you, too, Pumpkin.
Keep the door open.<eos> This isn't the first time I've fallen in love, Kusum.<eos> I was in love with someone before.<eos> I've worn my wedding attire before, ridden the horse before.. ..and taken the nuptial rounds with someone before.<eos> I've laughed with someone cried behind someone's back.<eos> I lost trying to build a home.<eos> And I lost so badly.. ..that I strongly detest this husband-wife relation.<eos> But after I met you.. ..I felt like I had the courage to repeat this mistake again.<eos> If someone who's scared of love.. ..falls in love again, then it must be something special.<eos> all I would like to say is.. I will love you, and keep you happy.
- Who is she yelling at in the morning?<eos> There are plenty of them out there.<eos> What's wrong, aunty?<eos> We had to get you two married.. ..because he was in love with you.<eos> It's the machine!<eos> The machine.<eos> You've made a mess of things.<eos> Mr. Sharma..<eos> - This is my new coat.<eos> I had warned you that she isn't the right girl.
- I sent it yesterday, by Blue Dart.<eos> I'm sure he's already received it.<eos> It's only the seven nuptial rounds, Tanu.<eos> You won't mind taking them again.<eos> I can give my life for you.<eos> Hey...don't touch me.<eos> This is the problem.<eos> One smile...and you think the girl's crazy about you.<eos> Was I just a bike and one liter of petrol for you?<eos> Only good for taking you to Raja Awasthi.
You must tell her once.. ..that Pappi's here for you. - Right.<eos> well then...do you have a picture of her on your mobile?<eos> I do.<eos> You see, everyone knows us.<eos> If we go inside, they will never leave us alone.<eos> You go inside and tell her..<eos> - l get it.<eos> Komal...your Pappi's here.<eos> No need to worry.<eos> He'll jump over this wall of wealth and take you away.
-Please, sit down.<eos> You are talented, young one.<eos> But you spend too much time fucking your hand.<eos> -What?<eos> How did you...?<eos> -Yes. And your hand doesn't enjoy it. It's not consensual.<eos> No. Now, that's not true at all.<eos> That's -- so, basically, you're raping your own hand.<eos> -No.<eos> -And that is why nobody loves you.
Because you know what we do to mortals in hell.<eos> Barb is on her way down to your office.<eos> I told her she can't go in unannounced.<eos> Damn!<eos> Look, I'm gonna kill both of you, but I need some time alone with an angel first, so sit over here and enjoy your last few moments alive.<eos> It's gonna be great.<eos> You're gonna love it. -Take your time!<eos> -Yeah, no hurry.<eos> See you in a few.<eos> I've been loving you for so long
Ah, really?<eos> What did you do?<eos> He pushed me on the ground and wrapped his leaves around my face and arms, and then, the next thing I knew, a branch was penetrating my ass.<eos> Oh, god!<eos> It was a pointy, pointy branch.<eos> I mean, did he wear, like, a leaf condom or anything?<eos> No, just bark.<eos> When he was done, he shed his acorns upon my back.<eos> Oh, that's the worst thing I've ever heard.<eos> Um, orpheus, what were you wearing when the tree violated you?
Remy, your idea worked!<eos> Yes! Oh, my god, yes!<eos> We did it!<eos> What are we gonna do with all this money?<eos> Let me just push this button to get this escalator started up again.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, yeah, that's right, there's no button!<eos> -Hey, start walking. -So just walk up to the top?<eos> Yeah!<eos> There's no motor gonna help you out here.
I'm alone.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> "You know what I mean," he says.<eos> Hey, want to tone it down a little?<eos> Or what?<eos> Or you'll see what!<eos> Really...<eos> You're happy? Proud of yourself?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Your father instructed me to find the fucker who put his hands on you.
You want to get me in deep shit?<eos> You'd prefer I tell the truth?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> Your father tried to get into your phone.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> Without the code, we'd be in trouble.<eos> He's stupid. My code is too easy.<eos> I'm being serious.<eos> I'm not joking.<eos> He made up his mind kill the guy who touched you.
How do you think I survived in this business for 35 years?<eos> Everyone I came up with is either dead... or locked up in federal prison waiting to be buried.<eos> I don't make mistakes.<eos> It's Christmastime.<eos> My friends are here to celebrate with me.<eos> Get the fuck out of my house.<eos> Take this shit with you.<eos> My old man.<eos> I don't even know what just happened.<eos> We paid you to guarantee your father's support.
Santa smells funny.<eos> Do you think Mommy wants to sit on Santa's other knee?<eos> I think Mommy's a little too big.<eos> Oh, Santa can make lots of room on here.<eos> That's my wife, Jimmy.<eos> Frank.<eos> It's Christmas.<eos> Give me a call if you wanna break the Irish curse.<eos> I'm skinny, but I'm long.<eos> Okay, let's see what Santa brought you this year, Kristie.
Now you're gonna bring Michael into this?<eos> I'm not bringing Michael into anything. I'm trying to get him out.<eos> Who you running from this time, huh?<eos> Shawn Maguire.<eos> I killed his son.<eos> I killed Danny.<eos> Get the fuck out of my house.<eos> It's not his fault.<eos> He's trying to get me out.<eos> He's not trying to get you out of this, Michael.
- Teaching, or? - Yeah, I'm a professor now.<eos> Wow, that was fast.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Umm... - I hope it's nothing too serious, is it?<eos> It's tough, she's...<eos> - ... not even 60.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Shit, I'm sorry.<eos> - Yeah, it's... - I'm sorry. I really always liked her.<eos> Yeah, she really liked you too.
To her?<eos> Mm-hm. You serious? Yeah, I want her to know me.<eos> Okay, listen.<eos> I thought you were kind of a like, Like backwards and really weird, uh...<eos> But it turns out you're not.<eos> You're um... I mean you're actually pretty cool.<eos> And that stuff you wrote, Really...<eos> That stuff was it was excellent.<eos> Still...<eos> And I'm telling you this because I love you, that girl is never gonna go for you in that way.
You're not coming.<eos> I'm trying to hide from the Boov.<eos> I'm not bringing one with me.<eos> You'll just turn me in.<eos> No!<eos> I just needs a ride!<eos> I haves official Boov business out of in town.<eos> Me, too.<eos> But I fixes your car!<eos> So? I let you out of the freezer.
Hello?<eos> Hold my crown.<eos> And be very careful.<eos> It's the only one.<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> Did you really think you could escape?<eos> Escape?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You see, I was just coming to tell you--<eos> Despite your elaborate disguise... the computer recognized you as... the fugitive Boov!
- I could've handled him.<eos> - You don't want this? I know.<eos> Is it house trained?<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> I try to behave like a gentleman, Doris.<eos> I really do, you know, but there's an animal side to everybody.<eos> You think less of me, don't you?<eos> For walking out.<eos> Please, how can you even say that?<eos> I was the one who dragged you out of there.
Oh, good morning.<eos> Pinchus Zion, attorney at law.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Cyrus Kinnick, looking for a Nick Wild.<eos> He's right behind you. Nick?<eos> This is Cyrus Kinnick.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hello, Mr. Wild.<eos> I was thinking of hitting the casino tonight.<eos> I wish I could help you, pal. You gotta be 21.
Said if you're not finished with your grapefruit juice, don't waste it.<eos> It's open.<eos> You want some coffee?<eos> No.<eos> I just brewed it.<eos> It's 100% Colombian, it's right there on the table.<eos> Holly, if you're gonna hide, why couldn't we have just talked on the phone?<eos> I just don't think I want you seeing me like this.<eos> Hey, Nick.<eos> You know, I kept calling out for you in emergency.
And that'll be the last you ever hear of me.<eos> 500 and... 6 thousand.<eos> It isn't exactly a round number, but then... I was never one to quibble.<eos> Fiji?<eos> Vodka.<eos> Rocks with a twist?<eos> Look at that.<eos> Doubles, please, Veronica.<eos> Thank you, Veronica.<eos> - So what do your friends call you?
OK, Ethan, what is it that you want?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Please start. Please start.<eos> - Please... start.<eos> All right, Ethan.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> Where do you want me to go?<eos> Fuck. I was scared shitless waiting for you.
For a luxury spa break.<eos> Why do you think?<eos> No.<eos> If you go into a hospice, you'll never come out.<eos> You get used to it, Jess.<eos> I have.<eos> When you were born, my darling, I lay quietly...<eos> After you'd had your 23 stitches.<eos> - Yeah, after that.<eos> I looked at you and I knew I loved you more than anything else in the world.
Vodka tonic.<eos> What?<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Vodka... tonic.<eos> You want a vodka tonic now?<eos> No.<eos> Pre-order it.<eos> From the bar upstairs?<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you so much.
What the fuck more do you need?<eos> - Seize the day.<eos> Am I right?<eos> - Yeah! I'm goddamned if I'll let my last memory of this business be getting laid off.<eos> If I'm going down, I'm going down in a fucking tsunami of dollar bills! - Can I get an "Amen"? - Amen, brother!<eos> Make it rain!<eos> All right, let's cut this, then sand it and stain it.<eos> Hey, Mike, any word on that thing we talked about?<eos> Yes, uh, is the answer, but... it just can't be right now.<eos> We need a couple more reliable accounts before I can get a policy for you.
So let me present to you... the absolutely adorable...<eos> Andre.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Caroline.<eos> Don't be shy. That's a beautiful name.<eos> It was my grandmother's.<eos> What did she do?<eos> Um, she was the first female, black grocery owner in the state.<eos> Strong woman.<eos> What brings you to Domina? Other than the obvious.

That's a beautiful name.<eos> It was my grandmother's.<eos> What did she do?<eos> Um, she was the first female, black grocery owner in the state.<eos> Strong woman.<eos> What brings you to Domina? Other than the obvious.<eos> Celebrating my divorce.<eos> And your girlfriends brought you out to have a good time.
That's a money spot. I expect y'all to make some money in that spot.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - How are the knees? - Rotten.<eos> You good?<eos> To tell you the truth, I haven't felt this nervous since Desert Storm.<eos> How have I known you this long and I don't know that you were in Desert Storm?<eos> Just never came up.<eos> Look, I don't know, me and you, we haven't really... had a chance to have our moment.<eos> Are we good?<eos> You know, Mike, when I called you... I didn't call to fuck with you. I called because I missed you, man.
- There is no God?<eos> - All I'm saying... is that if there was ever a time that man needed God it was then and trust me, he wasn't there.<eos> If you're expecting God to save you, he ain't gonna.<eos> Most men came out of that war wanting nothing more to do with killing, but not you... you went looking for it.<eos> God is not responsible for the life you choose.<eos> I did not choose it!<eos> Get off my land.<eos> We just come to finish the conversation that was interrupted, Dan.<eos> Let us avoid unpleasantness.<eos> Sir, I implore you to see reason.
No idea, but I have a hunch it rhymes with Smulitzer.<eos> - I wish I was there to celebrate with you.<eos> - If you lived here, you would be. You know I can't.<eos> Come home soon.<eos> - I will.<eos> I love you.<eos> - I love you, too.<eos> - What's up, man? - My dude.<eos> Hey.<eos> Listen, I don't want to bother you with this, but Marcus got a call from Save the Children about that article of yours. The cocoa plantation piece.
# Is getting in the way of my schee-am work #<eos> # What don't you comprehend?<eos> # # But working together is the key #<eos> # Nothing's impossible when it's you and me #<eos> # I'm doing just fine on my own #<eos> # Work is no fun when you do it alone #<eos> # If I want it done right, I'll do it by myself #<eos> # But what if you need something on a higher shelf? #<eos> # But I'm the target Of a very scary, crazy post-apocalyptic mob! #<eos> # Well, that's exactly why you need a partner # # Helping you with this important job #
- Whatever.<eos> # Working together in harmony #<eos> # Side by side, we can reach our dreams #<eos> # 'Cause nothing's impossible When we're a team #<eos> Okay, now for the brains!<eos> Okay, Plankton, this is it.<eos> It's gonna take all my processors and energy to power this time machine.<eos> So if you have anything you wanna tell me, you better tell me now.<eos> Well, Karen...<eos> I know I've taken you for granted all these years, and I, I just wanted to say, I'm glad you're on my tee-am.
What's that over there?<eos> Is it really you?<eos> - Yes, Patrick, it's...<eos> The Great Krabby Patty Famine is over!<eos> Great Krabby Patty Famine?<eos> What year is this?<eos> It's Thursday.<eos> According to my calculations, we've only gone four days into the future.<eos> Where is everybody?<eos> They all gave up on you.
A little bird dropped this off today.<eos> I Missed You!<eos> ♥ H.<eos> It's me, I'm the "H".<eos> Also, there's no birds.<eos> Also me.<eos> Herb, seriously.<eos> I want to dig up that William Shakespeare, so he can see what true writing is.<eos> I love it.<eos> That works because I love you.

- It's a mandatory class, man.<eos> - Thanks for bringing this stuff.<eos> - It's like Halloween down here.<eos> - Yeah, most definitely. - Yeah, party cen...<eos> What do we have here?<eos> What is this thing?<eos> - That's the old Hangman costume.<eos> - Looks pretty dumb.<eos> - Some kid told us not to touch it.<eos> - Did a little drama nerd tell you not to touch it?
What is that about?<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Cassidy's hurt and you haven't said anything? Are you serious?<eos> Don't put this on me.<eos> You're the reason we came here.<eos> Yeah, but maybe you're the reason all this shit's happening to us!<eos> - Don't even do that, okay?<eos> - Why not? - You brought me here!<eos> - I brought you here to help you!
Manners?<eos> That's a laugh.<eos> What do you mean by that?<eos> Only that I find it amusing to hear proper manners invoked by someone who tries to bust in on young ladies while they're pissing.<eos> - Did she tell you that?<eos> - Yeah, she did.<eos> And let me tell you, she was creeped out about it.<eos> That is regrettable.<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> What part of peeping on her seemed like a good idea to you?
Other times you make a little mistake, and you fall off the face of a mountain.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> It's the least interesting thing about him.<eos> Can we work on his life now?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> But, you know, I really think I should go up there sometime.<eos> Why?<eos> To satisfy your morbid curiosity?<eos> Sure, I mean, maybe my dad will take you up there.
All right, Ethan.<eos> Hannah, hear me out.<eos> I did my best to let go, but I had to write it anyway, a couple chapters at least, and I think we're onto something.<eos> Please forgive me for thinking brilliance comes with torture, but I'm not from your neck of the woods.<eos> Just read it, please?<eos> Right now, actually, because I'm waiting for you to walk through the door at Upton's bookstore.<eos> I'll be reading "Anna Karenina,"<eos> and if she throws herself under a train and you haven't shown up yet, I'll...<eos> Do you come with peace pipe or bearing musket?<eos> Hasn't anyone ever told you no before?
Lake whales, yes.<eos> I always thought God's belly after a burrito.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Sounded like a warning.<eos> Just winter crying uncle.<eos> I love living in a place where you earn your seasons, you know?<eos> Tough it out, see the ice return itself to mud, slimy reeds... become hopeful again.<eos> Hannah, do you feel that?<eos> I want to.<eos> Would you mind if I kissed you?
Hannah, there is grief and then there is worship.<eos> Yeah, please stop talking.<eos> - Mm, I totally fell for it.<eos> - Fell for what?<eos> I paid you everything I had left.<eos> Take the money.<eos> I don't care about the money.<eos> I put you up.<eos> Hell, I'm even putting out.<eos> And I'm rescuing you.
Gerry, would you be so kind as to order me a Woodford?<eos> A Woodford!<eos> Two Woodfords!<eos> Have you seen a NBA game up close?<eos> - Those guys are tall!<eos> - Hey, man.<eos> - It's a sign.<eos> - What is?<eos> It's a sign!<eos> You walking in the door while I'm calling you on the telephone
Oh, this?<eos> 200 Poker Tells by Joe Navarro.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How often do you listen to this, Gerry?<eos> Whenever I drive.<eos> Are you gonna make me listen to this the whole way to New Orleans?<eos> We don't have to listen to it.<eos> Hey, there, Gerry.<eos> Substituted you at the office today.
- Yeah.<eos> How often do you listen to this, Gerry?<eos> Whenever I drive.<eos> Are you gonna make me listen to this the whole way to New Orleans?<eos> We don't have to listen to it.<eos> Hey, there, Gerry.<eos> Substituted you at the office today.<eos> Hope everything's okay. Um...<eos> Anyway, it's all a bit awkward, but I feel I need to mention that some of the petty cash seems to have gone missing.<eos> Not that I'm accusing you of taking it, but Janice said when she left last night there was over 200 in the box.
What are you doing here?<eos> I was just driving through Little Rock. I thought I'd stop by.<eos> Oh, you were just stopping through Little Rock. Look, I don't have to stay.<eos> I just... Thought it did be nice to see you. Even if it is just for a minute.<eos> Come on in, I guess.<eos> I was just making some tea.<eos> - Do you want some? - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Sure. Absolutely.<eos> Hey, darling.<eos> Did I wake you? I'm sorry.
Purple sock.<eos> Same sock she had when we were married.<eos> I'm not a good person.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I don't deserve you.<eos> But you appeared. You...<eos> Like a leprechaun.<eos> Like a big, handsome leprechaun, right there in Iowa. There you were.<eos> Boom!<eos> And I had to follow you. I mean, boom.
Let me just go find Helen, take my shot... and I'll meet you in the lobby in a few minutes, okay?<eos> Uh, wait.<eos> Maybe we should stay.<eos> To, uh, support you.<eos> And maybe see some vaginas.<eos> This is crunch time, Mike.<eos> We can't go rolling up on her, three dudes in a suit... in a steambath.<eos> It's intimidating.<eos> She'll be overwhelmed.<eos> Just for the record, I'd like to go with you and support you.
- No.<eos> My two weeks are up.<eos> - I'm movin' in with my cousin.<eos> - Excellent.<eos> - In Philadelphia.<eos> - Davis. What?<eos> I'll get there by 11:00, leave at 5:00.<eos> You know, I feel like everybody's uncle around here.<eos> Yeah, why is that?<eos> Because I'm gonna save your ass, and I'm gonna put you up for a few weeks. - Obviously.
Don't think for one moment this is where I fall into your arms, seeking solace for my dead daddy.<eos> You sit there.<eos> Keep watch.<eos> That's what you're good at.<eos> Come anywhere near me and I'll kill you.<eos> I don't doubt it.<eos> Look. There are two of you.<eos> Two Jameses.<eos> Lucky me.<eos> Who sent you?
Go and sit in the staff room.<eos> I'm so sorry, Eilis. This is all my fault.<eos> I was led to believe that you didn't need looking after.<eos> Franco Bartocci says you're doing great here.<eos> Ma Kehoe says you're the nicest lodger she's ever had.<eos> - What?<eos> - "Ma Kehoe"?<eos> Don't ever call her that to her face.<eos> I'd forgotten just how bad it feels to be away from home.<eos> I've enrolled you in a night class, for book-keeping. Brooklyn College.
Two, two, three.<eos> Not bad.<eos> Two...<eos> Maybe we can have a dance later.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> - A dance, later.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Sure.<eos> Would you like to dance?<eos> Are you here with that guy, the one who was teaching you to dance?
- Hey, watch it.<eos> - Frankie.<eos> What?<eos> We don't. That is a well-known fact.<eos> Why, Frankie?<eos> Cos a big gang of Irish beat Maurizio up and he had to get stitches, and because all the cops around here are Irish nobody did anything about it.<eos> There's probably two sides to it.<eos> I might have said something I shouldn't.<eos> You know, I can't remember now.<eos> No, because they beat you up.
All I can say in his defence is he's the only one of us who'll get a college education.<eos> If he can keep his mouth shut.<eos> So, Tony tells me you go to college.<eos> Oh, just night classes.<eos> I want to be a book-keeper.<eos> I like working in the shop well enough, but I don't want to be there forever.<eos> I'm sorry, Eilis.<eos> I'm an idiot.<eos> I'm a rude idiot.<eos> So has Tony offered to take you to Ebbets Field when the season starts?
Well, it sells lovely things.<eos> But I can't afford many of them and I don't like the work, so...<eos> What would you like to do?<eos> I want to do what Rose did.<eos> I want to work in an office and deal with numbers.<eos> Well, you should call in at Davis's.<eos> They haven't managed to replace Rose, you know.<eos> I'll be going back to New York straight after the wedding.<eos> But you might want to earn a little money in the meantime.<eos> I'm sure they'd be glad to have you.
I said: "What are you doing here?"<eos> What does he see in you, I wonder.<eos> Who is he?<eos> I want to see what is done.<eos> Why don't you take off the cuffs.<eos> And I'll show you.<eos> Vinter.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> Janik Vinter.<eos> They call you, the bone doctor.
He's going to take the Prime Minister.<eos> Yes, he is.<eos> The question is how?<eos> Well, we have to warn the British government.<eos> - Yeah, MI6.<eos> - No, no, Brandt.<eos> Put down the phone.<eos> Let's think about this.<eos> We have a responsibility to warn the British government, and not gamble with the Prime Minister's life.<eos> Ethan, just so you can beat the guy that's beaten you at every turn.
Oh boy.<eos> And what about Lane?<eos> Forget about Lane.<eos> There will always be another Lane.<eos> There will always be people like us to face him.<eos> We've done our part and we've been cast aside.<eos> We can be anyone.<eos> We can do anything.<eos> It's only a matter of going.<eos> Lane sent you to deliver a message, didn't he?
Who's Andrea?<eos> My kid... she came by your place earlier today.<eos> I'm hanging up.<eos> No, no, no, she just called from a pay phone... and she said she's coming home soon.<eos> I don't want to her driving drunk.<eos> You're the only guy around there I know.<eos> Gillian, I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Andrea.<eos> Repeating the name doesn't help.<eos> Andrea, you dumb fuck, she said she saw you this afternoon.
You just fucking got shit all over me.<eos> Man, I should fucking lay you out.<eos> You better give me money for all the shit you just ruined.<eos> Yeah, you should give us everything you got.<eos> You look 14.<eos> Man, suck on these nuts.<eos> And give your shit before you start bleeding.<eos> You.<eos> How old are you?<eos> He's old enough to fuck you up.
All my friends are fighters.<eos> And here comes this guy, spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he'll win.<eos> Sounds amazing.<eos> He's also a huge dork.<eos> Chicks dig that.<eos> So what do you think? Should I fight this, or run with it?<eos> Run with it, right?<eos> Or did he...<eos> Was he...<eos> What did he do that was so wrong to you?
There was this terrible noise.<eos> And I was tangled in...<eos> In...<eos> Strings.<eos> I had to kill the other guy.<eos> He was a good guy.<eos> You killed someone?<eos> Wouldn't have been my first call.<eos> But, down in the real world, we're faced with ugly choices.<eos> Who sent you?
Wakanda.<eos> If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods...<eos> I thought your father said he got the last of it.<eos> I don't follow.<eos> What comes out of Wakanda?<eos> The strongest metal on Earth.<eos> Where is this guy now?<eos> Don't tell me your men swindled you.<eos> I sent you six short-range heat-seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts.<eos> Now, you will make it right, or the next missile I send you will come very much faster.
Natasha!<eos> Bruce?<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The team is in the city.<eos> It's about to light up.<eos> I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere.<eos> Yeah. I did.<eos> So what's our play?<eos> I'm here to get you to safety.
My swift and terrible sword.<eos> And the earth will crack with the weight of your failure.<eos> Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me.<eos> It means nothing.<eos> When the dust settles, the only thing living in this world<eos> will be metal.<eos> We gotta move.<eos> You're not gonna turn green?<eos> I've got a compelling reason not to lose my cool.<eos> I adore you.
Hey, you!<eos> Come back here.<eos> Sorry about your bike.<eos> Come back here!<eos> Cam.<eos> Cam.<eos> You want your check or not?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Lonnie, I need more runs.<eos> Cam, I'm happy to help you out, but you need a bike first, man.
We do our research. Plan every move. Work as a team.<eos> Everyone knows their job.<eos> Documents, chemicals, technology. Anything.<eos> We don't take sides.<eos> Now I got just two rules.<eos> The first is, if you get in trouble, I'm your first call.<eos> The second, you stay out of Chinatown.<eos> - Even if you're not on a job.<eos> - Why is that?<eos> I'm inviting you to sit down at the dinner table.
No, I'm tired.<eos> I'm... gonna hit it.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Wanted to talk to you.<eos> How did you find me?<eos> Why are you living on the roof?<eos> Why didn't you tell me you were with Miller?<eos> Dylan got into some trouble.<eos> And Miller made it go away.<eos> So your brother pimped you out to the boss.
- Philandering?<eos> No, it isn't that. My choice of words...<eos> It's not about that at all.<eos> How do you even know that, anyway?<eos> Well, I...<eos> Mr. Stone, may I be candid with you?<eos> I don't know what the hell you're getting at.<eos> I love you.<eos> - Right, I'm leaving. - No, no. Look.<eos> I've never talked to you like this before.
Not Lisa!<eos> Here's your breakfast, Mr. Stone.<eos> Oh, hello, Michael.<eos> - Where is she, Emily? - She's not here.<eos> - Michael?<eos> - Lisa, let's go! - What?<eos> - Lisa, don't go with him.<eos> He's insane.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I don't have the time to tell you. Just come!
- Michael, how are you?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, how are you?<eos> - Daddy, what's coming out of the toy?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - God, Michael, it looks like semen. I don't know.<eos> I just got it at a store.<eos> I don't know.<eos> What's semen, Mommy?<eos> It's just a liquid, Henry. It's just a liquid.<eos> Michael, do you realize that we love you?
Real as an organ.<eos> It's the day blood.<eos> Something's fuckin' wrong with it.<eos> I was eight the night they were killed and suddenly I was famous.<eos> The little orphan girl of the Kansas prairie massacre.<eos> So, strangers send me money.<eos> Just enough for me to do nothing.<eos> Which was exactly what I did.<eos> How much is left?<eos> Do you read the reports I send you?
No, don't touch me.<eos> - Daddy's got ya.<eos> - Get your hands off me!<eos> Remember when you were a little girl? - No! No!<eos> - Say uncle! - No!<eos> Let me go! - Say uncle!<eos> - No! Uncle!<eos> - Say uncle!<eos> Jesus.<eos> How long has it been since I've seen you?
How much do you have at your place?<eos> I've got some saved up.<eos> My mom, she's got, like, 500 or 600 lying around.<eos> But I don't know where. Yeah, all right we'll go there. Okay.<eos> If we don't see a cop car outside, we'll go inside, we'll get the cash, we'll pack a bag and we'll get the fuck out of here, okay?<eos> Then what?<eos> What fucking planet are you on?<eos> Are you even sure this kid's mine?<eos> How dare you!<eos> Ben, baby, I love you, you know.
A secret love child.<eos> That's right, baby.<eos> Crystal knows the whole story.<eos> I tell her everything.<eos> We're best friends.<eos> I read your book, too.<eos> I even have a little scrapbook of photos of all of you.<eos> Clipped out of magazines and stuff.<eos> It's like a fake family photo album.<eos> Can I call you aunt Libby?
It's the least I can do.<eos> of course.<eos> But you don't have to...<eos> I'm free tomorrow.<eos> Tomorrow?<eos> I don't know it.<eos> Can I borrow a pencil and paper?<eos> Thank you.<eos> All right<eos> I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.
Hi.<eos> Hello.<eos> Carol Aird.<eos> Richard Semco.<eos> Glad to meet you.<eos> Likewise.<eos> Therese speaks very highly of you. Well.<eos> That's well.<eos> So you'll get her back here safe and sound?<eos> Love you.
All right, let's take this thing to its max altitude!<eos> - Oh, shit! -Grab the computer.<eos> Okay, so, unlike other static systems, my algorithm tracks gestures while the operator is moving.<eos> Elevation, 140. 151, David. 170!<eos> It should have a vertical reach of about 250 feet.<eos> What is that?<eos> Is that my phone?<eos> David, I think I lost signal.<eos> The call's interrupting the Wi-Fi.<eos> Who could possibly be calling you right now?
I'm part of the group now, right?<eos> What's outside?<eos> I'd usually make a joke, but this is awesome.<eos> Dude, Quinn is insane!<eos> David! What up, dude?<eos> He's crazy!<eos> I got Mexican food! I got Cuban, fusion, Indian, all sorts of different flavors!<eos> Adam! Where's mine?<eos> Way to go, Finn!<eos> Did she just call you Finn?
What's up with you?<eos> I can't believe how good I'm getting -at sneaking past your mom. -Yeah.<eos> By the way, my dad, who never loves anyone, loves you. Somehow.<eos> He thinks it's really, really adorable every time you talk about science and all the projects that you used to do.<eos> It's kind of amazing.<eos> Enough, please.<eos> Chris. Please have mercy on me.<eos> What's up, Patrick?<eos> Dude, the other night was dope!<eos> God, what is up with you, David?
I know exactly what to do to fix this.<eos> Justin broke his leg at Walker's party. I'll fix that.<eos> Everything else will fall into place.<eos> Guys, I'm sorry.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> David, what are you doing here?<eos> What do you mean? This is where we're supposed to meet.<eos> You're 15 minutes late. No, we said we'd meet at your house first. We had to track the controller.<eos> Yeah, why didn't you call me?<eos> We all called you, David.
What happened to "nobodyjumps alone"?<eos> I know!<eos> I'm sorry for yelling at you.<eos> I just keep thinking I can go back and I can fix it myself. I don't have to worry about anybody else.<eos> You keep thinking?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> How many times have you done this before?<eos> David, how many times have you done this before? I'm sorry.<eos> Wait, where are you going?<eos> You have to stop talking. You're being too loud. People are gonna hear you.
A lot of people patent their ideas but only a few of them actually get their ideas made.<eos> So Trudy just wanted to be careful<eos> Joy I just wanted to let you know that Touissant has almost finished his work.<eos> You know, we really need to find some more work for him.<eos> -You want more work in the house?<eos> -Yeah. I have another big job I have to go to.<eos> -What?<eos> -Well, but we have real issues here.<eos> -We don't have money for that work, Mom.<eos> What is happening to you, Mother?
I heard "skinny pants"<eos> You know how much I love the stovepipe.<eos> -Stovepipe. Classic. Got it.<eos> -Got it. -Fine, we'll go for stovepipe.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> See those guys?<eos> I told them so many times and they still don't understand.<eos> A very smart guy once said<eos> "You tell somebody something once, they don't listen. You tell somebody four times, they don't listen.<eos> "By the ninth time you say it, they begin to hear you."
She was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.<eos> I can't believe I'm about to talk to the Little Red-Haired Girl.<eos> It's moments like this when you need your faithful friend.<eos> Yep.<eos> If there's one person you want by your side at a moment like this... it's your loyal dog.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> She said, "Hello"!<eos> Charlie Brown!<eos> What brings you out here so late in the day?
- Oh, no, here she comes!<eos> - Someone needs to get this dance started.<eos> These cupcakes don't look half bad, if I do say so myself.<eos> This time I've come totally prepared.<eos> I couldn't have done it without you.<eos> The old Charlie Brown would still be lying in bed with a stomachache.<eos> Good grief.<eos> Marcie, look!<eos> Everyone's here!<eos> Let me help you with that, Marcie.
These are the greatest books of all time.<eos> Please just pick one!<eos> Let me sleep on it, Marcie.<eos> There's no time for sleeping, sir.<eos> It's due Monday.<eos> Just my luck to get a partner that thinks Moby Dick was a hockey player.<eos> Marcie?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Hey, Chuck, old boy.<eos> What brings you down here?
You should be down there having fun with everyone else.<eos> I can't stop thinking about it, Linus.<eos> After all the humiliating disasters she witnessed this year... why would she choose me?<eos> Was she feeling sorry for me?<eos> I don't want her to choose me just because she was feeling sorry for me.<eos> I have slightly more dignity than that.<eos> Charlie Brown... it might be time to consider the wild possibility... that you're a good person and that people like you.<eos> But, you know, you'll never really know the answer, unless...<eos> I just go up and talk to her!<eos> I should've listened to you all along!
I don't know.<eos> Bloody Mary.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> Is she talking backwards?<eos> Is she saying, "Bloody Mary"?<eos> What's Bloody Mary?<eos> - It's a game kids play.<eos> -What kind of game?<eos> Originally in the game, you say it three times and a witch appears and shows you who you're supposed to marry.<eos> But when I used to play it, the way most kids play it, you say "Bloody Mary" three times and a bloody witch appears and grabs you by the neck.
Good night, sweetheart.<eos> Mommy.<eos> - Did I die?<eos> -What?<eos> When I was a baby?<eos> No.<eos> Who did you hear that from?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, there was a cord in Mommy's tummy and it got wrapped around your neck, and the doctors got scared because it made it hard for you to breathe.<eos> So, they went in there real quick and they got you out.
Let's get you tucked back in.<eos> Just go back to sleep, okay?<eos> What was that?<eos> It was nothing.<eos> Okay, sweetie.<eos> Why don't you lay down and get some sleep?<eos> Just get some sleep.<eos> Hey, Lee. I saw something in your room last night with you and Auntie Skyler.<eos> Honey?<eos> What woke you up last night?
Lee! - What the fuck?<eos> Lee, are you okay?<eos> Baby, baby, breathe.<eos> Calm down. Okay, good girl.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Good girl.<eos> What were you doing?<eos> He's gonna take me away.<eos> Who's gonna take you away?<eos> Who's gonna take you away?
I'll just call him back at 4:00. Thank you.<eos> She's been acting strange.<eos> And things have just been starting to happen more and more and we really don't know what to do.<eos> Baby Jesus.<eos> Here's Mary.<eos> She's going to have a special baby.<eos> That's right. She is.<eos> Do you remember us coming into your room last night when you were on your recorder?<eos> Well, when we came in there and put you back to bed, you said, "He's gonna take me away."<eos> Who's gonna take you away?
No, you tell me where she is.<eos> Tell me where she is!<eos> Where is she?<eos> What is that?<eos> Oh, baby, hi.<eos> Are you okay? Are you okay?<eos> I'm okay, Mommy.<eos> They just needed one drop of my blood.<eos> What? Where did they cut you?<eos> What did they do to you?
Are you okay? Are you okay?<eos> I'm okay, Mommy.<eos> They just needed one drop of my blood.<eos> What? Where did they cut you?<eos> What did they do to you?<eos> Oh, baby, your hand.<eos> He's alive now, Mommy.<eos> He's real, just like you and me.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What did they say to you, baby?
Get Finn's bag.<eos> I'm sorry, Claire.<eos> Iggy!<eos> Iggy!<eos> Stay here, Claire.<eos> Iggs.<eos> Iggs.<eos> Iggy.<eos> Jesus, Iggs.<eos> What did they do to you?
One look at me, and you knew your old man had done a lot of bad things, didn't ya?<eos> I cheated men, I killed men...<eos> So I deserve whatever's comin' to me.<eos> The only one that ever saw any good in me was your mother.<eos> Oh! Why have you come here?<eos> Not a man for chitchat, huh?<eos> Well, me neither.<eos> Kid, I'm dying... of consumption.<eos> Don't worry... I'm not looking for no big father-son hoo-ah.<eos> "I love you, son." "I love you too, Daddy."
Well, me neither.<eos> Kid, I'm dying... of consumption.<eos> Don't worry... I'm not looking for no big father-son hoo-ah.<eos> "I love you, son." "I love you too, Daddy."<eos> I've come for a more tangible reason.<eos> Tommy, I've been stealing from folks since I was nine years old... and that's the way I've amassed a good little fortune.<eos> I wanna do something decent with it.<eos> I want to give it to you, son.<eos> I don't want your money.<eos> But maybe you could give... $50,000 to these nice Injuns who raised you.
Deep in the ground... next to a windmill.<eos> A windmill in the West... doesn't narrow it down much, Frank.<eos> Well, this is a special windmill.<eos> It's a singing windmill.<eos> A singing windmill!<eos> It's about a ten-day ride from here.<eos> I'll lead you to it presently on one condition.<eos> You don't hurt my boy... or any of these kindly Injuns here.<eos> Let's ride, Frank.<eos> Frank, if that $50,000 isn't under that windmill, I'm gonna bury you up to your neck and let the desert critters eat you alive.
When they get to the singing windmill and find no money, they will kill him.<eos> My son, there are too many trees and too little time.<eos> Then I must get this $50,000 another way.<eos> How?<eos> By stealing?<eos> There is no honor in that.<eos> Unless I steal from those who have no honor.<eos> I like that.<eos> But it is too dangerous.<eos> I will send ten of our strongest braves with you.
Where'd you learn all this stuff?<eos> My father taught me.<eos> Dad?<eos> I thought you just met him last week.<eos> Not our father.<eos> Screaming Eagle.<eos> He raised me since I was a kid.<eos> He's the kindest... wisest man I've ever known.<eos> Wow... must've been nice to have a dad.<eos> Oh, yeah, someone to wrastle with and teach you how to cut up your panny-cakes.
Yeah, son, we'll do that.<eos> You must be Delilah's boy.<eos> Boy, she made some fine, fine whiskey.<eos> She must've been really hitting it hard when she was pregnant with you.<eos> Atta boy, atta boy.<eos> Da-da.<eos> And, uh... you are?<eos> I'm Lil Pete.<eos> I'm your son!<eos> I love you so much, Dad!
Water.<eos> Water.<eos> No water.<eos> Water.<eos> Is there water?<eos> What?<eos> Oi, get off him!<eos> Hey!<eos> They work for Unkar.<eos> That guy that wanted you.
BB-8, stay close!<eos> This way.<eos> Call in the air strike.<eos> Come on!<eos> They're shooting at both of us.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They saw you with me.<eos> You're marked.<eos> - Well, thanks for that. - Hey!<eos> I'm not the one who chased you down with a stick.
- Okay.<eos> For what?<eos> Are we really doing this?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> - Nice shooting.<eos> - Now that was some flying.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - How did you do that?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - No one trained you?
It was the Republic.<eos> The First Order, they've done it.<eos> Where's Rey?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You have to go back.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> BB-8...<eos> No, you can't.<eos> You have to go back, you're too important.<eos> They'll help you.
You know I can take whatever I want.<eos> You're so lonely.<eos> So afraid to leave.<eos> At night, desperate to sleep.<eos> You imagine an ocean.<eos> I see it.<eos> I see the island.<eos> And Han Solo.<eos> You feel like he's the father you never had.<eos> He would have disappointed you.
Your son is gone.<eos> He was weak and foolish like his father.<eos> So I destroyed him.<eos> That's what Snoke wants you to believe.<eos> But it's not true.<eos> My son is alive.<eos> No.<eos> The Supreme Leader is wise.<eos> Snoke is using you for your power.<eos> When he gets what he wants, he'll crush you.
It's difficult to argue with that logic.<eos> Come with me.<eos> My great-grandfather, a ferocious warrior.<eos> Not well-liked, but he was responsible for expanding our lands into the province it is today.<eos> My father... he alone was responsible for protecting these lands during the Great War.<eos> You would've taken pleasure in knowing him.<eos> My son.<eos> I have no heir.<eos> I will be the tenth and last generation buried here.<eos> 30 years ago this month, and against all counsel, it was idealism that led me to invite you into my home.
- It's already done.<eos> Think only of what follows.<eos> The spirit of our clan will endure through you.<eos> Commander Raiden!<eos> The Emperor's word is not a request that requires your decision.<eos> Remember this, Raiden, the wounds of honor are self-inflicted.<eos> Draw your sword.<eos> My Lord... - Commander... draw your sword.<eos> Your devotion to the code is absolute, is it not?<eos> - Yes, My Lord. - Then, as your lord and master, I order you to complete this duty.
I sentenced myself to hard labor shucking oysters.<eos> 999,999.<eos> And today's the last day of my penance.<eos> One million.<eos> You could give me a raise and we'd be good.<eos> Where the hell you goin'?<eos> He complained about the eggs.<eos> He said they were staring up at him like the eyes of a dead clown.<eos> He said he knows you from Paris.<eos> He called you "Little Tony."
Oh, shit.<eos> Adam?<eos> Michel! Okay!<eos> It's okay.<eos> I had a long time to think about what you did to me in Paris.<eos> When I was your sous chef at Jean Luc's, we were like brothers.<eos> So when I left, it's only natural that you were... hurt.<eos> So you took your revenge.<eos> Look, Michel, I don't know why I did that.<eos> I know it was terrible, but... what exactly did I do to you?
My fault.<eos> If it's not perfect, you throw it away.<eos> Regardless of time.<eos> Eat it.<eos> Yes, chef.<eos> Now spit it out before you die of "who gives a fuck" scallop.<eos> I kinda made a mistake with you.<eos> I didn't know you were deaf.<eos> I'm not deaf.<eos> Then how come I left you at the saucier, then I find you at the Poisson?
Really?<eos> Adam?<eos> Adam?<eos> - Adam?<eos> - Yo.<eos> The maids don't come?<eos> I always leave the, uh, "do not disturb" sign on.<eos> We have a laundry service as well.<eos> You have an invitation.<eos> Montgomery Reece invites you to the relaunch of his restaurant.
Set it up.<eos> I have.<eos> And, boss? Garza says to leave Buddy at home.<eos> I thought you were dead.<eos> Why didn't you answer my calls?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Victoria?<eos> Victoria?<eos> Vittoria.<eos> Can I call you Vee?
So, now what?<eos> - Rise and shine, my Denisovich.<eos> - Hi, Papa.<eos> Hello, my little devil.<eos> Did you have sweet nightmares?<eos> I dreamed that I saw a stegosaurus.<eos> And were you drinking his blood?<eos> - Just throwing it out there.<eos> You want to do something cool?<eos> I'm going to teach you how to turn into a bat.
I'm just gonna miss him so much.<eos> - I love you, Dennis.<eos> - I love you, Mommy.<eos> I'll tell him Mavey Wavey stories every night before bed.<eos> You're the best.<eos> I love you, Dad.<eos> Gonna miss all you guys.<eos> You're all my family.<eos> - Love you, Drac.<eos> - Yes. I love you, too.
And you better be there or I swear, Dad, you're gonna be very sorry.<eos> - What's goin' on?<eos> - We need to get home right away.<eos> I'll go wake up my backpack.<eos> Guys, we gotta move.<eos> We got no car!<eos> How we gonna get out of here?<eos> Don't worry. I made a call.<eos> I'm sorry, Blobby.<eos> We really meant to call you sooner.
What are you doing, sweetie?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Careful.<eos> Let me help you down from there.<eos> Are you getting excited about your big party?<eos> - I guess so.<eos> - You know who's coming?<eos> Daddy's whole family.<eos> Grandpa Mike and Grandma Linda.<eos> All your cousins and aunts and uncles who love you so much.
Then, tomorrow, when it's safe, have all the nationals reabsorb into the community, go to emergency evac plan for the expats.<eos> - Are you all right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Are the keys in the Rover? - Yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> Okay. Give that to security.<eos> Now can you do that?<eos> - I will take you to Kinshasa, Mr. Jim.<eos> - No, no, no, Eugene.<eos> You've gotta do what I asked you to do because you're the one who can do it.
- Thank you.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Jim Terrier.<eos> - Terry.<eos> For fuck's sake. Oh, man.<eos> I heard you were living in London all this time.<eos> - You don't call, you don't write.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Please, will you sit down?<eos> I'm surprised that they let you in, looking like that.
What happened?<eos> What... Sorry. Am I missing anything?<eos> Why is everyone so tense?<eos> I mean, if you think of the coincidence of all of this, you should not be tense.<eos> A dear and old friend arrives in town just as we are formalizing the adoption of our first child.<eos> - I think it's a reason enough to...<eos> - Stop.<eos> - Sit down.<eos> - You're humiliating me.<eos> No, the way you stared at him humiliates you.
So, do you believe in fate?<eos> Sure.<eos> Do you?<eos> How could I not?<eos> I mean, every day I walk Muffin down Elm Street, today I went down Maple, and there you were, unconscious on somebody's lawn.<eos> - Hmm. And usually I take a taxi back to my hotel room, but last night, I accepted a ride from a complete stranger who reeked of alcohol and could barely stand up straight.<eos> And if that hadn't happened, we would've never met.<eos> - I know.<eos> It's like that drunk driver was an angel, sent down to watch over me.<eos> I love you, drunk driver who almost killed me.
As you know.<eos> Yeah, that's gotta be rough.<eos> So, Donnie, how's school? Uh, What...<eos> What grade are you in?<eos> First?<eos> Wow, you gotta be one of the bigger kids in the class, huh?<eos> No, Donnie, don't disrespect your father.<eos> He's not my father.<eos> Aha! The plot thickens.<eos> No, he means he doesn't accept you as a father.
- What hat?<eos> - Your pilot's hat. Oh, right.<eos> I don't like to wear it when I'm not flying.<eos> Too pilot-y. Which I am, of course.<eos> Pilot.<eos> I'm a pilot. Wait, why is your tie tucked into your shirt?<eos> I thought only loser stewardesses did that.<eos> Flight attendants.<eos> Is what those losers prefer to be called, and this tie-tuck is my way of mocking them.<eos> Come on, I'll walk you to school.
Nah, things like that only happen in the movies, Nathan.<eos> This is real life.<eos> But how did she know how to do that with the arm tray?<eos> I mean, it's like she knew my every move. But how?<eos> Isabella.<eos> The woman who seduced me and with whom I shared all my secrets, and then never heard from again.<eos> You came to support me.<eos> I'm truly touched, that is so sweet.<eos> I don't think that's what happened, Lar.<eos> I think she plied you for information
Bryce, hold our course.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> - Coffee smells good.<eos> - Don't touch anything.<eos> Hey, Larry, what the hell is going on? What's this about a blown fuel line?<eos> No time to explain.<eos> Take that, robot bitch.<eos> Uh, Larry. That's not her.<eos> There you are.<eos> - May I help you? - Yes, you may.
Because I was an idiot, who thought that not being tied down and going from woman to woman to woman, to, in some cases,<eos> - women, plural.<eos> - Go on. Would be a fun, fulfilling lifestyle, but the truth is, it was soulless and empty.<eos> All that meaningless sex was just filling a hole.<eos> And by hole, I don't mean vagina. Or in some cases, I guess I do mean vagina.<eos> I know what you mean.<eos> April...<eos> Is there any chance you could see your way clear to taking this idiot back?<eos> Oh, gosh, Larry.<eos> Did you really think you could just waltz back into my life because you were finally ready and I'd be sitting here waiting for you?
It's me!<eos> - Larry.<eos> - Larry.<eos> Larry.<eos> You look wonderful, Son.<eos> You too, Dad.<eos> You must have come to ask my forgiveness for walking out all those years ago, and to beg me to allow you back into my life.<eos> That's exactly right, Larry, that's why I'm here.<eos> Well, there was a time...<eos> There was a time I would've told you to stick several unwieldy objects in your ass.
I'm Lavinia.<eos> Lavinia.<eos> You're probably thinking I'm a little young to be staying at the Marigold.<eos> Either that or your plastic surgeon's a genius.<eos> I'm... quite interested in your new place.<eos> Come by again sometime.<eos> Maybe I will.<eos> Or maybe I won't.<eos> That means I will.<eos> Mummyji. Guy Chambers has chosen you.
- And you're having an affair.<eos> - Oh, so it is. Wonderful.<eos> I said I know you're sleeping with someone else.<eos> Of course I am, darling.<eos> Aren't you? What about that twitchy little witch at the club?<eos> Susan.<eos> Obviously you've both been at it like rabbits for weeks now.<eos> No.<eos> I mean no!<eos> Well, why not? What's been stopping you?
Okay, fine. Fine.<eos> Do you know what?<eos> I'm putting my daughter on the phone. Explain to her why she has to go to school in a gangbanger school district where they're murdering kids. Murdering!<eos> Here, you tell her.<eos> Hey, baby, do what I showed you.<eos> - Why do you want me to get murdered?<eos> - No.<eos> "Murdered. Why do you want me to get murdered?"<eos> They hung up.<eos> Because you're not doing what I told you to.
"Murder. Murder."<eos> - Watch out.<eos> - Move, old man.<eos> Is that weed?<eos> Hey, I want you to be safe, okay?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Listen to me. You're not gonna be at this school forever.<eos> Daddy's working on it.<eos> I love you.<eos> - I love you too.
The boss is here.<eos> Maybe it's time that we act like we got work to do.<eos> We got 40 cars and we got eight hours of the air down here!<eos> James King, Wealthrop Funds.<eos> Transfer 100 million from my client accounts.<eos> I'd like to put a buy order on Bradway Chemical, up to 7.50.<eos> I've got a good feeling about clean coal.<eos> Clean the roofs, Mike.<eos> You don't think people can see those?<eos> I hired you to do one thing.
Mr. King, please. I feel like you just haven't given me...<eos> Success is a mindset!<eos> Hi, everyone!<eos> Thank you so much for celebrating our engagement with us.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Everyone, just "shh."<eos> You need to "shh." Senator.<eos> Yellow tie.<eos> I see you.<eos> James, I love you and I can't wait to be married to you.
Cut it off.<eos> Cut it off.<eos> Get it out of my face, man.<eos> I can turn it on with no hands.<eos> I don't want to see that. I don't want to see that trick.<eos> It's okay. Put it back. God.<eos> - Put it back? - No.<eos> No, no.<eos> Stop. Stop. Stop.<eos> - Do you want me to teach you how?
I'm so glad to be back in Crenshaw where it's safe.<eos> My heart is just now finally settling.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're alive.<eos> How about we make a toast to escaping fucking Nazis.<eos> Yes.<eos> You really are innocent, aren't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - Okay, so James, if that's the case then why aren't you trying to find the guy that framed you?
But not at any cost.<eos> Not this way.<eos> How am I gonna look at him?<eos> Things don't always go the way we want.<eos> He'll look at me, wondering if I'm his father.<eos> I won't be able to answer him.<eos> I'm sorry, Laura...<eos> I didn't want to...<eos> I'm with you, I love you...<eos> I love you too.
-What's going on?<eos> -Enough!<eos> -Get out of the way!<eos> She's my wife!<eos> -Calm down! -I'm calling the cops!<eos> -Oh, fuck off!<eos> I asked for this color with this leather.<eos> -What about this?<eos> -It's a whole different thing.<eos> Don't be angry with him, he loves you.
It sucks.<eos> It sucks really bad.<eos> It sucks quite a bit.<eos> Dad, Cat Stevens is clawing me.<eos> Well, he's deeply distraught.<eos> Well, you know, I was talking to Denise and Denise feels that you might be someone who could make Rachel feel better.<eos> Yeah, but like I said, we're not really friends, so...<eos> Just give Rachel a call.<eos> Yeah, well, what do you want me to say?<eos> "Hey, it's Greg, the guy who's "never really paid attention to you...
I didn't tell anyone.<eos> I heard you bellowing about it on public transit.<eos> Is that a fact, Greg?<eos> Look, yesterday, Earl and I got stoned somehow. And it was after we both ate your soup.<eos> And we didn't smoke any marijuana, which I have never done, so...<eos> Your soup must have drugs in it, 'cause that was the only thing we both ate other than some cookies we got from Ill Phil, the drug dealer.<eos> Aha. Man, how did you not know it was the cookies?<eos> Man, it was your dumb ass yelling that shit on the bus.<eos> Yo, Greg! Did you snitch on me?<eos> He did snitch on you!
Here.<eos> That one's called Mono Rash. It's based on Rashomon by Kurosawa.<eos> Plot's basically just Earl killing people 'cause he has a rash from mono, you know, the STD.<eos> Anyway, we're supposed to go work on our homage to Apocalypse Now.<eos> Ours is called A Box O' Lips, Wow, which is even worse than Mono Rash.<eos> It's a war movie where these two guys take part in the unspeakable brutality of war and then they find a box of tulips.<eos> Box O' Lips, yeah. And they're just, "Wow."<eos> They can't get over how great these tulips are, it's like, "A box o' lips, wow!"<eos> The worst part is, tulips might not even be in the budget anymore.<eos> I should actually just stay here and keep you from watching that.
Right.<eos> And now, I'm learning that there are... protect your kid from, you know?<eos> No matter what you do, you just...<eos> So, did she have any favorite toys?<eos> Before I answer that question, this is serious so use your ears and listen to me.<eos> I want you to promise me something as I care about you.<eos> You gotta promise me you're not gonna have a baby unless you're ready to love that baby's mother your whole life and this is serious.<eos> I'm telling you something that nobody's gonna tell you.<eos> Don't pick a girl who's push-pull, you know?<eos> You wanna pick somebody who's gonna love you and not forget you, and not leave you for someone with a big, fat ass.
Well, we know what's gonna happen, right?<eos> I know who you can take to prom.<eos> Who?<eos> This sexy pillow here.<eos> Ooh, Greg, this pillow's name is Francesca. Don't joke, I can't deal with that. She's a filthy Italian woman.<eos> Please, stop!<eos> Don't yell at me.<eos> So, that's it? Just, to hell with college, to hell with growing up?<eos> Greg, don't.<eos> Rachel, what the hell is wrong with you?
Oh, please, Greg, you should be overjoyed. Now you can go back to your life of being invisible and detached and self-hating.<eos> And you can go back to your life of being dead.<eos> Nice. Really nice.<eos> This is gonna kill your mom.<eos> Have you gotten comfortable with that?<eos> That doesn't bother you anymore?<eos> Thinking about your mom?<eos> Get outta here, Greg. You've done your time. You don't have to hang around with the sick girl anymore.<eos> How can you even say that to me?<eos> Your mom forced you to hang out with me.
Into my nest, one by one, if need be.<eos> I think twice before I stick it in something.<eos> Better than that Moroccan dope, huh, Kenny?<eos> Can we get on with it?<eos> And you, Dave, got a ball and chain yet?<eos> Is there a Miss Dave?<eos> Or Mr. Dave? It's allowed, you know.<eos> You have to watch out for them, Dave.<eos> I mean it.<eos> First, they do anything to trap you.
My wish will be fulfilled.<eos> Isn't that right?<eos> Lord Shiva does whatever He thinks.<eos> Hail Lord Shiva!<eos> Hail Lord Shiva!<eos> What did he say?<eos> Shiva!<eos> How long are you going to sit holding that wooden mask?<eos> There is somebody up there.<eos> Maybe there is, but your mother is calling out to you.
Before she could decide on who will ascend the throne the Queen Mother was faced with a new crisis.<eos> In the form of one of their trusted Saketa.<eos> Saketa killed the guards and stole our military secrets.<eos> Call for the Princes!<eos> - As you wish.<eos> The young Princes searched for the traitor in neighbouring kingdoms.<eos> Finally they found out that he was hiding in a den of thieves called Singapuram.<eos> It is a lawless place where bandits thieves and murderers gathered and mingled.<eos> Strangers who drew attention to themselves were in mortal danger.<eos> I have never seen you before.
The one who kills the Kalakeya chief will ascend the throne of Mahishmathi!<eos> My Lord has the perfect solution.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Divide the rest of the army equally between the Princes!<eos> Bhalla, Baahu.<eos> This is the opportunity to pay tribute to your motherland!<eos> Accept it.<eos> Hail Mahishmati!<eos> - Hail Mahishmati!<eos> Your uncle has treated you unfairly.
- I do!<eos> And do you, Ted, take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?<eos> Fucking right I do!<eos> Then by the power vested in me<eos> I now pronounce you husband and wife.<eos> You may kiss the bear.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, your newlyweds!<eos> Teddy this is the best day of my life!<eos> - I just love you so much!<eos> - I love you too Tammy!
- You better not be messing with me.<eos> - I swear to God, I'm not mesing with you!<eos> - You'll make an awesome mom!<eos> - Oh my God, are you kidding me?<eos> - I would like kick so much ass at being a mom.<eos> - So what do you say, we all good?<eos> - Yes!<eos> I love you, I love you so much!<eos> - Oh baby!<eos> I love you too.
- What the hell is your problem?<eos> - Take an apple.<eos> You sons of bitches.<eos> - That's the lottery, that's the lottery!<eos> - That's what you get for fucking exercising.<eos> Teddy?<eos> - Teddy, I'm scared.<eos> - Baby, we're gonna be fine.<eos> I don't care what any fucking piece of paper says, you are my wife.<eos> I love you so much!
- Nobody said Starbucks!<eos> - Who is in the Starbucks?<eos> - Bill Cosby!<eos> You people are monsters!<eos> We are giving you the tools buddy.<eos> Make some fucking comedy.<eos> Alrigh, we'll be back tomorrow afternoon.<eos> I love you so much Teddy.<eos> You go kick some ass, because I am not taking of this wedding ring.<eos> I love you too baby, I'll see you soon.
I was just hurting cause I knew I'd lost.<eos> And that in the eyes of the world I will always be property.<eos> But you know what?<eos> Who gives a shit?<eos> It doesn't matter what the world calls me.<eos> I know who I am.<eos> And that's all that's important, and I know who my friends are.<eos> And honest to God, if you two want to be together<eos> - Nothing would make me happier.<eos> - Oh, buddy I love you for that.
- What is your name?<eos> - Ted Clubberlang.<eos> As for the complex emotions and the capacity for empathy, we all saw the distressing images of Ted agonizing over his fallen friend<eos> John Bennet.<eos> In those images, Ted exhibits all of the remaining qualities of personhood.<eos> It's right there for anyone to see.<eos> And I believe that a just court must by definition grant basic human rights to all those who deserve them.<eos> Just add the Emancipation Proclamation and the 13th amendment did so many years ago.<eos> So ladies and gentlemen of the court.<eos> I invite you to change the world.
Hey, is that...<eos> - No.<eos> It is not. - How did you get that?<eos> - I didn't get...<eos> - I know what it...<eos> I saw what it said.<eos> It doesn't say anything!<eos> Was that the Cincinnati box?<eos> - Don't say that out loud.<eos> - It might hear you.
And I would take you out into the Gulf and feed you to a tiger shark.<eos> Damn, that's cold.<eos> But I wouldn't use a gun.<eos> I'll be making my own mid-morning cocktail from now on, thank you.<eos> Man, I wish Adam was here. He'd know what to do.<eos> You just described my whole entire life.<eos> We need Adam and he's not here.<eos> Where the hell is he?<eos> Holy shit.<eos> When we were carrying you after you got shot, I saw his trench coat beside the hot tub time machine.
- Strut, strut, strut...<eos> Wow, they're really good at your dance.<eos> Your poor man's Macarena that you are very famous for.<eos> Everybody do the...<eos> They're, like, picking dicks out of a tree.<eos> It looks like dick-picking.<eos> And for the record, I still like your music.<eos> I mean, I know you've fallen on hard times.<eos> Hard times?<eos> You're so poor now, but I really like you still.
- What?<eos> That's awesome!<eos> Now, see, this is that future shit I'm talking about.<eos> How much that set you back?<eos> You guys are hilarious.<eos> I don't own it.<eos> I mean, no one does.<eos> You need a car, one shows up.<eos> Really?<eos> You're a wonderful car and I appreciate you.
Go ahead!<eos> Hit me!<eos> Come on!<eos> You're not a good car!<eos> You're not smart!<eos> You're just a car!<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't think it actually works that way.<eos> Like, you can't hurt its feelings.<eos> You're a wonderful car and I appreciate you.
Chip off the old block.<eos> Okay, be nice.<eos> Be nice. Be nice.<eos> Be nice. Be nice.<eos> Be nice. Be nice.<eos> Son!<eos> Hey!<eos> What a coincidence!<eos> Wondering where you ran off to, but here you are.<eos> Who let you in here?
Welcome to our show!<eos> We got a very, very exciting show planned for you tonight.<eos> Please help me welcome back to the stage, musical sensation,<eos> Nick Webber!<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, honey, guess where I am. Just guess.<eos> Okay, shut up.<eos> I'm at Choozy Doozy.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I tried to call you, like, a hundred times.
I'm sorry. Can I just get rid of this thing?<eos> No!<eos> She said not to take it off for 24 hours.<eos> - Or what?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> Look.<eos> Oh, my God, the cocktail waitress was wrong.<eos> Sorry, my mistake.<eos> I should listen to you more often, Lou.
This is who I've become, isn't it?<eos> The dancing clown.<eos> The man who will apparently do anything to keep his shitty career going.<eos> Meanwhile, when's the last time I shared a romantic dinner with my wife?<eos> Or just did anything, just the two of us?<eos> It's been a minute.<eos> I'll bet there's a lot of people here tonight who have been taken for granted.<eos> This lady right here.<eos> When's the last time your man gave you flowers, just because?<eos> Fuck you, dude.
Okay, okay, okay!<eos> I mean it.<eos> I do. I mean it.<eos> I'm a dick.<eos> Ask my friends.<eos> - He's a dick.<eos> - Big ol' dick.<eos> Look, I get you. I do.<eos> I know what it's like to feel unappreciated, like just a member of the pack.<eos> I just want you to know that despite what I said before, I do appreciate you.
To walk away from you?<eos> To turn me into this isolated, afraid thing that I am.<eos> You had no right.<eos> Walk with me, Katia.<eos> I loved your mother very much.<eos> She was a light in a very dark world.<eos> And more than anything else, she wanted a child.<eos> But she was unable.<eos> So we broke every rule we had, and we made you.<eos> We knew that if you were discovered, they would take you from us.
Do it.<eos> Oh, fuck it!<eos> That's quite enough, John.<eos> You can wait outside.<eos> All of you.<eos> It's okay, John.<eos> Petya.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> I'm going to be completely honest with you.<eos> I admire you.
He was your target the whole time?<eos> Everything you taught me was just so you could have a diversion.<eos> It was necessary.<eos> What, to kill a single man?<eos> No.<eos> To put a stop to the Agent Program once and for all.<eos> And to set you free.<eos> Your father loved you, Katia.<eos> He understood that Le Clerq would not rest once he knew who you were.<eos> That he would hunt you down.
Don't lie.<eos> I can't stand it!<eos> I was with Victor.<eos> We walked and talked.<eos> That's all.<eos> Oh yes!<eos> Did you play cards too?<eos> You want me to say I slept with him?<eos> I wanted to, yes.<eos> But I didn't, for I love you.
"Best-seller,<eos> "best-seller."<eos> Yes?<eos> You didn't go?<eos> I couldn't.<eos> This is too serious.<eos> That's why you must leave.<eos> Please go.<eos> I don't want to spoil my life.<eos> I can't help waiting for you.
Your father sensed it, but I didn't.<eos> I'm so sorry...<eos> It's OK.<eos> I apologize too.<eos> You kill me, old bag.<eos> You've the right to reject me.<eos> I was a bad mother.<eos> I didn't know your origin.<eos> But past can't be changed.<eos> You deserved a mother who loved you.
Sorry to rush you, but they can't wait.<eos> They'll wait, because we're not divorcing now.<eos> I can't understand my parents' stories.<eos> It'd be better if women played the role of wife and mother with true devotion.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Nature did not give us the same talents.<eos> To be elected, you must update your ideas.<eos> Let me tell you, we vote too.<eos> I regret that.<eos> I adore you.
Want one?<eos> Same again, please.<eos> 17 July 1991.<eos> Remember?<eos> How I hated you.<eos> I waited at the station, like an idiot, thinking the world belonged to me.<eos> I was waiting for you to join me to go to Paris.<eos> But you never came.<eos> It's strange...<eos> I thought I'd forgotten you, but when I saw you again...
The problem wasn't the dead, but our fathers.<eos> Yours and mine.<eos> And we judged them both wrongly.<eos> I can't believe Rebec cancelled my dismissal.<eos> And I threatened to do a DNA test.<eos> Mum, can I call him "Dad", or is it too soon?<eos> - Too soon...<eos> - He's jealous.<eos> Defend yourself, Jérôme.<eos> I could never love him like I love you.
Marie...<eos> Rosalie had just had you.<eos> She asked for a divorce.<eos> We were getting married.<eos> I declared you as mine.<eos> The captain found out.<eos> - You declared me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> So you'd be an Elbert and get this house.<eos> So the husband shot you like a rabbit, and sent me to an orphanage.
I was disgraced by this kid who screwed his superior's wife!<eos> I apologize to you all.<eos> I'm no hero.<eos> As for boxing, I have to say I can't do it.<eos> - I'm not...<eos> - I understand, Alphonse.<eos> You can't face it.<eos> Don't worry, I'll do it, I'm an Elbert.<eos> I promise I'll do you proud.<eos> Not your fault she idolized you.
1... 4, 5,<eos> 6, 7, 8, 9, 10!<eos> Marianne Portal, winner by knockout in the 2nd round against Karima the Butcher.<eos> Marianne Portal!<eos> Never again.<eos> Here's to the next 20 years.<eos> You'll be busy tonight.<eos> Marianne, we need to talk.<eos> What about?<eos> I beat you with my fists.
giving me life.<eos> Wait... that's crazy.<eos> Maybe not entirely.<eos> Don't say anything.<eos> I'll deny everything she said.<eos> Enough, José.<eos> I gave the judge all my correspondence with Francis.<eos> He has all he needs.<eos> I know why I'm here.<eos> Marianne denounced you.
Everyone has his place.<eos> That's fair.<eos> I'll come with you.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> We'll be together forever.<eos> I'm not afraid.<eos> Mum, I'm putting the noodles to cook.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Don't ever forget I love you.
I'm coming.<eos> For fuck's sake.<eos> I'm not deaf, you stupid fucking... morning, Johnny.<eos> All right, Paul.<eos> What's up?<eos> Not much.<eos> How about you?<eos> Yeah, I'm all right.<eos> Better than all right from what I heard.<eos> My mate, the clam said he saw you last night down at the pub.
Let's go, Guy.<eos> Just-Just go careful, alright?<eos> - It's just...<eos> - Please don't.<eos> Come on, please don't worry.<eos> It's just that doing nothing back here that's making me worry.<eos> - You're not doing nothing.<eos> - No, but...<eos> What?<eos> It's the waiting for you.
Acclimatize.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm normally a tea man myself, but...<eos> - Let's give it a go.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> Well, it's crazy this year, aye.<eos> I know, man.<eos> Some idiot kiwi goes and advance Himalaya guide here.<eos> Look what happens. Yeah.<eos> Didn't take you too long to get in on the act.
- Go go.<eos> ♪ Everywhere you go, always take the weather, the weather with you ♪ Hey, man.<eos> Breaking into the rations?<eos> Yeah, you want some?<eos> No.<eos> I'll... I'll wait till we summit.<eos> I don't know about that, Neal.<eos> We'll get there.<eos> I'm excited.<eos> Anyway, me and Anatoli are here to help you, you know.
Yeah.<eos> What do you think?<eos> - No way.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - No.<eos> - Please, think about it.<eos> - No. - Huh.<eos> - You're still there? - Of course I'm still here.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you too.
Yeah. I'll make it down in half the time.<eos> I'm going to catch him. Woo.<eos> Cheers, mate.<eos> CAMP TWO: 21,300 ft 6,492 metres.<eos> Rob to Guy.<eos> Rob to Guy.<eos> You up there, mate? (MOUNT PUMORI, 5 MILES WEST OF EVEREST)<eos> Guy to Rob.<eos> I'm here. (MOUNT PUMORI, 5 MILES WEST OF EVEREST)<eos> Good to hear you, Guy.
Base camp, do you copy, over.<eos> Helen to Rob.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Helen, please.<eos> I need a bottle of gas at the top of the Hillary Step.<eos> I can't get him down without it.<eos> I'm really stuck.<eos> Understood.<eos> That you need a bottle of oxygen at the bottom of the Hillary Step.<eos> We're sending it up to you as soon as we can.
( Saturday, 11th May )<eos> Pick up, mate. Please ( 05:00 AM )<eos> Was there any word from the others?<eos> Anatoli managed to get 3 climbers back from the South Col last night.<eos> But... Beck and Yasuko are still out there.<eos> They're trying to mount a search but everyone who's been up there is exhausted.<eos> - Base.<eos> - Rob, is that you?<eos> Rob, where are you?<eos> We're sending people for you.
Go and sit down.<eos> What's going on, Vince?<eos> This place is empty.<eos> Short staffed.<eos> Summer's tomorrow.<eos> - What's up? - It's where the PM lands at two.<eos> Chiefs trying to make everything work out following his code.<eos> Mm-hmm, no excuses, no overtime, right?<eos> There isn't gonna be any overtime if you stick around long enough.<eos> I've been pleading for a bigger holding cell ever since the brass dropped you off here.
Sophia.<eos> I'm gonna... Can I... Can I get you a drink?<eos> I think I should be the one buying you a beer.<eos> Oh, no. Doesn't work like that where I'm from.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're buying.<eos> Sophia!<eos> Hi! Whoa.<eos> There you are.<eos> I've been looking all over for you.
No.<eos> I'll pick you up at your place.<eos> Does 6:00 work for you?<eos> Okay.<eos> Ladies.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> I know you.<eos> Marcia, right? Mmm-hmm.<eos> The last time I saw you... you were a little blurry.
Wait.<eos> I want a big family.<eos> A really big family.<eos> I've always wanted one since I was a little girl.<eos> With everything that's going on now... I feel this need, this responsibility, to bring life back into the world.<eos> Sounds perfect.<eos> You can ask me now.<eos> Ruth... I know I'm not a rich man.<eos> Don't know the last thing about art.<eos> All I can do is promise to love you... every second of every day for the rest of my life.
Don't know the last thing about art.<eos> All I can do is promise to love you... every second of every day for the rest of my life.<eos> Really?<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, yes, yes!<eos> What took you so long?<eos> Welcome to the family.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So good to have you.
Sweet.<eos> That's Luke's dad, Jack.<eos> He was a great man. Mmm-hmm.<eos> Great rider, too.<eos> Even if you stop now, you'd still have a better career than he had.<eos> What happened?<eos> He died of a heart attack.<eos> Yeah, almost five years ago now.<eos> How about a little dessert?<eos> Luke, wait till you see what I made for you.
Thank you.<eos> Luke...<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> I know how hard it must be to give up that whole part of your life.<eos> You're kidding, right?<eos> Sophia...<eos> You heard the doctors.<eos> Doctors don't know everything.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> I watched what happened to you on YouTube.
I'm going crazy.<eos> I know it's not your fault.<eos> I have to go.<eos> No, please don't!<eos> I just need to say something.<eos> I need to say something.<eos> I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.<eos> You're just the most amazing, beautiful girl I ever met... and somehow... I don't know, somehow you chose me.<eos> But how I loved you then... it's nothing compared to how I love you now.<eos> Now, I love you with everything inside of me.
Ghosts and demons, and the devil himself.<eos> Something like that, yeah.<eos> This is about your friend, your case.<eos> What did you find?<eos> I don't know, I can't explain it.<eos> It's something... otherworldly.<eos> And you want to know how to stop it.<eos> Yes.<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> You should carry a cross and holy water, and shout, "The power of Christ compels you?"
You don't stop evil.<eos> You can only protect yourself from it.<eos> Do I believe things that you're talking about exist? Yes.<eos> And I believe they exist to lure men like you into them.<eos> Stay out of it, whatever it is.<eos> Whatever happened to the Oswalts is only gonna happen again.<eos> It's a question of when and where.<eos> Gotcha!<eos> What? You didn't make the noise. You didn't say the words.<eos> - No, I killed you. - I shot you in the back.

Sweet dreams.<eos> This one's mine.<eos> Just play it.<eos> I know you're there.<eos> Why'd you have to pick him?<eos> Because you're not good enough to be one of us.<eos> You're not smart enough to do what he can do.<eos> I'm better than him.<eos> I'm smarter too.<eos> If you were, then we would have chosen you.
Sometimes I think I'm invisible.<eos> Well, I see you.<eos> I wonder what I'm doing here sometimes.<eos> - What do you mean by that?<eos> - You know what I mean.<eos> You mean you have thoughts of killing yourself?<eos> I just can't do it.<eos> Hello.<eos> Who are you here to see?<eos> Is your mum or your dad here with you?
I was worried.<eos> You took my car.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> What have you been up to?<eos> - Remembering.<eos> - Remembering what?<eos> I remembered everything.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Elizabeth Valentine.<eos> I saw you... I saw you... rape and kill her and throw her body in the wreck.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I am really, really sorry.<eos> Now, Mona, can we talk?<eos> Hello?<eos> Mona. Should we...?<eos> Can we talk about this?<eos> I mean, I think we need to be constructive and I know what I've done is really stupid and I know it hurts you a lot.<eos> I can see that. I can see...<eos> I love you so much.
Who else did you tell about this?<eos> Nobody.<eos> Don't lie to me.<eos> I'm not. I swear to you, I'm not.<eos> No one else knows, and she won't abort it. Are you sure?<eos> Yes, I am very sure.<eos> Do you want a divorce?<eos> No.<eos> Never.<eos> I love you so much.
And I love our beautiful kids.<eos> And our life.<eos> Our goals?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you're committed to achieving our goals?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> I assume this is about money.<eos> It's what all those greedy, anti-nuclear-family types want.<eos> Guess there's only one thing to do.<eos> I will do whatever you want, honey because I am so sorry, and I love you so much.
Hey! You get me?<eos> I get you.<eos> Do you fucking get me!<eos> I don't want to hear "can't," Don!<eos> "Can't" is not gonna work! That's not gonna work!<eos> This is your fault!<eos> Now you can't even do what it takes to make it right!<eos> After everything I've done!<eos> Everything my parents have done!<eos> All the money! All the opportunities we've given you!
- Thank you.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Hey. - Yeah?<eos> What really happened to your hand?<eos> You know...<eos> I took your advice and I told Mona.<eos> - And your hand was the only casualty?<eos> - Well, she slammed it in a panini press.<eos> - While you were making a panini?<eos> Well, what did Mona do? Did she kick you out?
- Right? - This way, buddy.<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm Don Champagne.<eos> Why don't you shake the hand that's gonna shock the world.<eos> What happened to your hand?<eos> I actually... I dropped a couch on it.<eos> Was it heavy?<eos> It was heavy. Yeah.<eos> So, Don, I'm sure that little slut told you all about us, didn't she?
You know why.<eos> Can we just say that I deeply, deeply disappointed my... idealistic son?<eos> You cheated.<eos> 19... suddenly, my boy's an expert on true love.<eos> That's because he had fallen in love.<eos> Any idea with who?<eos> You get anything out of the senator?<eos> Kid recently fell in love, wouldn't say who with.<eos> So probably mexican or old or something.<eos> I don't need to tell you about inappropriate love, do I, Gravely?
What did you dig up for me?<eos> Come on.<eos> I got to solve this murder.<eos> I'm rotting away in the traffic division.<eos> Make me want to stick a gun in my mouth.<eos> And I like catching murderers.<eos> Don't make me have to beg.<eos> I tell you what.<eos> Here's, uh... about 100 bucks.<eos> I will help you with this only because I want you to succeed in your new job.
Gisele.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's one more thing.<eos> I found this.<eos> Must've meant something to him.<eos> When you find the guy that killed Han...<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> Words ain't even been invented yet.<eos> They say to live in the hearts of those we leave behind... is not to die.<eos> But he put you in his grave.
And she's going to need her father.<eos> So you have to finish what you're doing... and you have to come home to her.<eos> You have to come home to us.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't tell you before.<eos> I was scared you'd be disappointed with domestic life.<eos> You know the best decision I ever made was stepping into that store... buying that first sandwich.<eos> It was such a bad sandwich.<eos> I know.<eos> But I ate a lot of 'em.<eos> I love you, Mia.
She actually speaks eight languages, but Loser is not one of them.<eos> Everything must come to an end, even with Bellas.<eos> Take care and lose nice.<eos> Your sweat smells like cinnamon.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Das Sound Machine.<eos> They've got the crowd going wild! Okay!<eos> Channel!<eos> Das Sound Machine, an incredible performance, once again from the German group.<eos> I'm telling you, Gail, though, if the Bellas of old show up tonight, this could be the most significant conflict between America and Germany... in history.
We are Barden University's Bellas.<eos> That's my girl.<eos> Is it possible, the Barden Bellas are doing an original song?<eos> It looks like the Barden Bellas are being joined on stage by generations of Bellas, going all the way back to the beginning.<eos> Simple, raw, vulnerable, exposed.<eos> I've been called a lot of things, Gail, but let me add one more,<eos> - I'm impressed.<eos> - I thought you were going to say "gay".<eos> Oh, they have touched every person here, they've touched me, John.<eos> Well, everyone has touched you, Gail, but this is something else.
It looked like people had been squatting in her house.<eos> It stank, it was dirty.<eos> And she was lying on the bed, . .and she had this golf ball coming out of her head.<eos> So we worked til like three in the morning and cleaned the house.<eos> And I called her dad, and we called Nick.<eos> (nick) We all met there and it was like,<eos> "This is getting out of control. " "We need to get her some help. "<eos> I 've tried speaking to the parents . .and they really wanna kinda take it on.<eos> And so I, technically, I sort of kidnapped her.<eos> I picked her up and I thought, . . "l 'm driving you to the middle of nowhere
And I 'm looking at her trying to get some form of reaction.<eos> She went "Jules, this is so boring without drugs. "<eos> And I felt really, really, really sad for her. (violin music continues) (MALE REPORTER) Amy.<eos> Amy, how d'you feel after winning a Grammy?<eos> - l 'm going to see my husband. (YASllN) I was staying at the K-West Hotel.<eos> Very late in the night she knocks on the door and I 'm alone.<eos> She comes in and she just sits on the couch.<eos> I remember feeling like really happy for her . .and also concerned cos she really didn't know . .how to be that thing that she had been pushed to become<eos> Then she pulled out this aluminium foil. She said, "Does this bother you?"<eos> And I said, "Amy, I love you.
I can't come to the phone now.<eos> You've reached Brooke Cardinas.<eos> Leave your name and number and I will get back to you at my earliest convenience.<eos> Hi, this is Brooke Cardinas. I just got a missed call from this number.<eos> Sorry. Um, this is Tracy Fishko.<eos> My mom is marrying your dad.<eos> You're reading the sonnet!<eos> Right.<eos> We're doing Thanksgiving and then wedding together.<eos> I go to college in the city and my mom said I should call you.
You guys used to do this thing where you would walk up to me... touch my skin and then like taste it and think for a minute, and then say: "Yep, bitter." And then laugh.<eos> Right!<eos> We did do that, didn't we? We were weird.<eos> I was standing right there, every single time you did it.<eos> It was really mean.<eos> And I just wanted to say fuck you.<eos> The way you treated me really messed me up for a long time.<eos> Everyone is an asshole in high school!<eos> You made a lot of people feel bad, not just me.<eos> I feel sorry for the 13-year-old girl that was you but I don't feel sorry for you now.
He's late to pick me up.<eos> You want to play chess with us?<eos> You have to teach me!<eos> No, he'll be here any minute.<eos> Sorry, I got started on the wrong foot there.<eos> I meant to say I've been missing you as a friend and...<eos> She has a very exciting business opportunity for you.<eos> And I wanted to bring it to you and Dylan as a peace offering.<eos> I really think you're gonna want to hear about this.<eos> The last time I saw you, you were hiding in the bushes. And then you started incoherently yelling at me and my husband about how we had ruined your life. And the time before that, you were throwing up at my wedding.
MC, where's that weed Jason gave us?<eos> You've just said "weed" like 15 times.<eos> Did that kid take my weed?<eos> No! No one's touched it.<eos> It should be next to the Chipwiches.<eos> Are you sick?<eos> No, I'm healthy.<eos> Don't shut me out. You know how hard that is for me.<eos> You sound like you're eating something.<eos> I have a Chipwich for you.
No. It's fiction, that's why it's fiction.<eos> So much of this "fiction" did not happen this way.<eos> Karen, you're a lawyer.<eos> I'm going to sue you until you have nothing.<eos> I'm just writing from my life.<eos> No! This is not your life.<eos> But I was there that night.<eos> I was gonna have that night anyway. You never were.<eos> But I did have it, though.<eos> You joined my life. You needed a place to go. I invited you in and then you stole my life.
I had told you the blue one is better, but you still buy the red one.<eos> Great, great, another win.<eos> So many fights - what's the deal?<eos> Need money?<eos> It's a living. I need to eat too.<eos> That time at the school, you hurt my men.<eos> You owe me.<eos> How much do I owe?<eos> It's not about that.<eos> I admire you . I wanna be your friend .
Get off!<eos> - You alright?<eos> - Yup.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> - Tobias Eaton.<eos> - You say that again.<eos> Tobias Eaton.<eos> What you know him?<eos> I am him.<eos> We have been looking for you.
- Divergent 100%.<eos> - I'll be damned.<eos> - What?<eos> - She's what we've been looking for.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> Divergent 100%.<eos> Get her in a veichle.<eos> I'll alert Jeanine.<eos> If you think you got lucky, you're wrong.<eos> You gonna wish I killed you.
Chen Zhen, come out!<eos> Wolves come. Hurry up.<eos> - Gasma!<eos> - Chen Zhen, stay away.<eos> Stand back or the wolf will bite you.<eos> Push the sheep aside to let the dog through.<eos> Send Bars over.<eos> Let the dog come.<eos> Mama, mama!<eos> Let me help you.
He wants you to remarry.<eos> Nothing strange about that.<eos> - His son needs a father.<eos> - His woman needs a man.<eos> She doesn't.<eos> She's too busy.<eos> He wants you to choose me.<eos> Why would he want me to choose you?<eos> You are a Han student.<eos> Because he knows I love you.
We are gathered here today to ask you why you haven't moved on.<eos> Guess she's still not much of a conversationalist.<eos> We are calling on you to answer this question by guiding these quills through our own hands.<eos> Hold your writing implements, close your eyes, and await communication.<eos> Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Abby!<eos> Daniel!<eos> Abby!<eos> What the fuck? !<eos> We have to call someone... the police or your probation guy.<eos> And tell them what... that we were having a séance and we stabbed you in the hand and then an evil spirit wrote my name on the wall in your blood?
Stop!<eos> Let go!<eos> Teddy, stop it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Wait!<eos> Stop it.<eos> Stop it, Teddy.<eos> He cornered you like this, didn't he?<eos> Made sure you couldn't scream.<eos> And then he said something to you.
Hmm.<eos> She means it'll cost you.<eos> Cash.<eos> Up front.<eos> Or you will just have to wait another year...<eos> I'd rather die than make one costume for those vile idiots!<eos> How could you...<eos> How could you invite them up here?<eos> !<eos> - They left you to rot!
Why is the door open? Hello?<eos> Ab, is that you?<eos> - Boss?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Boss, are you alright?<eos> - Yeah, I'm sort of okay.<eos> Tired of this crap.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Have they left you alone or given you a rough time?
I was in this building, a hallway, and I saw this girl.<eos> And the building was on fire and there were these people in an apartment, and they couldn't get out, and I could see their fingers underneath the door.<eos> What's that on your arm?<eos> Holy...<eos> This is... That's where it grabbed me! Oh!<eos> What... What grabbed you?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Frank? You wanna tell us what's going on here?<eos> - Frank! What the hell's going on, man? - I...<eos> She told you, right? Obviously she told you.
Help me.<eos> No! No!<eos> No, stop.<eos> - I thought you were my friend.<eos> - I am your friend. But you're not being yourself right now. We still don't understand...<eos> "...what's happening to you."<eos> I spent my whole life trying to make up for one mistake.<eos> I did everything right.<eos> And I still ended up in hell.<eos> Zoe, we can help you.
- Do you understand? - Yeah.<eos> You have a brother, right?<eos> It's silly, but I've never been to England.<eos> Why don't you come with me then?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's not just an empty suggesture?<eos> No, it's not an empty gesture.<eos> Seriously, come with me.<eos> But just for the record..<eos> I wanted to do that since I first saw you.
There's no way out.<eos> Not this time.<eos> It will be a hazy memory for Jack at the most.<eos> I spoke to Delacroix less than half an hour ago.<eos> And everything was under control.<eos> We can go and check on them on the way.<eos> No, I don't want to do that.<eos> Fuck!<eos> What have they done?<eos> I'm such a fool, I should've listened to you.
- Okay.<eos> Make shit!<eos> Nickel.<eos> - Nervous?<eos> - No.<eos> I am, I confess.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm not good.<eos> I stop thinking in time to kiss you.
I prefer when it's cooler.<eos> What is the solution?<eos> The heated seat.<eos> - What?<eos> - Open your door.<eos> Will refresh you!<eos> Ç a va ...<eos> I'm fine, I'm fine!<eos> We will play, go!<eos> I'll have you!
Good.<eos> Anna?<eos> Yes.<eos> Are you sure you want to do this?<eos> We can still cancel everything, you know?<eos> I can't stop until I get all the way out.<eos> Okay.<eos> We'll do as we planned.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
And England wasn't close enough?<eos> Your mother's buried there.<eos> The island is like a cemetery to me now.<eos> Easy on the drama, Dad, please.<eos> Just promise me you won't stick me in the ground. Hmm?<eos> Your mother was a good Catholic and everything, but when it comes my time to go, just throw me on the fire and feed me to the fish.<eos> You gonna get that, Junior?<eos> I don't use the phone while I'm driving.<eos> Hi, Gina, it's me.<eos> We're all waiting for you.
Where the hell is he?<eos> Yes?<eos> It's not nice to keep ladies waiting alone in a dark alley.<eos> Whoever those ladies are, tell them I'm on my way.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, you should have just given me the key.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I don't know!<eos> Is he drinking tea or what?<eos> What took you so long?
I can't remember the last time either of them slept in the same bed as the men who pay them.<eos> I don't think he paid.<eos> Well...<eos> Something else?<eos> Yes.<eos> I wanted to thank you for what you've done for us.<eos> I'm sorry I lied to you about the poison.<eos> How about being sorry you kidnapped my father in the first place?<eos> I'm sorry about that, too.<eos> It was wrong for me to use your father, and it was wrong for me to use you.
Couldn't stay away?<eos> There's a new deal.<eos> I thought you said you never...<eos> That was before he took my dad.<eos> Listen, I'm in this shit because of you and so is my dad.<eos> So whether you agree or not we're going to see Karasov on his yacht right now with the ledger.<eos> I was all for you, now I need you to do one for me.<eos> Do we have a choice?<eos> Not really.<eos> We'll help you.
I heard you.<eos> I assume you have a plan, Junior.<eos> What is this?<eos> You tell us.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> You called the meeting.<eos> I didn't call anything.<eos> Cut this shit.<eos> What's this about?<eos> Well, for one, I found the people who stole from you.
All right? I got in trouble.<eos> What kind of trouble?<eos> - Some guys here like picking on me.<eos> - So you got into a fight? No.<eos> No, not exactly.<eos> - They cornered me.<eos> - Why you? - 'Cause they know I'm won't fight back.<eos> - How do they know that?<eos> Because everyone in here knows how badly I want to get out.<eos> So they cornered you and you had to spend time in solitary?

Has he been over here?<eos> - Tell me the truth.<eos> Then what is this, Miranda?<eos> This is a chip of paint. He brought it into the shop.<eos> It matches that ceiling.<eos> Daddy, listen, okay?<eos> William's been here.<eos> - Please... don't say that name around me! - Okay, I'm sorry!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> He raped you, Miranda, right here in this house! He raped you.
Don't wander off too far. We don't want to send a search party for you.<eos> Yes, your majesty.<eos> I'm sorry I just did that.<eos> No.<eos> Ben seems sweet.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think he's a keeper.<eos> Sorry, I don't mean to pry, but what is this about putting you on medication?<eos> Antidepressants.<eos> No, you can't let them do that to you.
Morning.<eos> Everything is great. Nothing to worry about.<eos> Due date is gonna be spot on.<eos> Sadie!<eos> ' Hi!<eos> ' Hi!<eos> So good to see you.<eos> And I'm so sorry that I didn't text you back.<eos> Felt stupid.<eos> I called you like a hundred times.
Everything's okay.<eos> What's everybody doing here?<eos> We're here 'cause we love you.<eos> David asked us to come over tonight just to help you get through this tough time.<eos> A goddamn intervention, David?<eos> Think of it as a support system.<eos> Who's she?<eos> I saw you with her outside the cafe.<eos> This is Victoria Lambert.<eos> She's a family therapist and we asked her here tonight just because we think she can help you.
Get down.<eos> I'm trying. It's more far for me.<eos> Got you.<eos> Hey, Chiquita, get back.<eos> Hauser, you don't wanna do this. You've already killed one fellow officer today.<eos> Yeah, but they say it only hurts the first time.<eos> Hey, I was just coming...<eos> I told you you should've stayed behind a desk, Coop.<eos> Son of a...<eos> - I'll call you.
Well, there's one thing you're gonna need either way:<eos> - The right pair of shoes. - Aah!<eos> How did you...?<eos> Must have gotten lost in evidence.<eos> I can't believe that you broke your little book of rules for me.<eos> All right, keep it down.<eos> Exactly how many times did you broke the rules?<eos> I mean, exactly how many pairs of times?<eos> Well, I got you the sparkly stilettos to go out... the sparkly stilettos to stay in... and, of course, the corky wedges.<eos> I mean, I could kiss you right now.
Listen<eos> Wow<eos> Sangailé<eos> Come here lt's Sangailé<eos> - Hello<eos> - Hello, Sangailé<eos> Good evening<eos> You're already grown up!<eos> Aren't you hungry?<eos> Last time I saw you, you were very small
I think it was the truest moment I ever had<eos> You know<eos> When you are backstage and you're waiting to go on<eos> it feels like your heart will burst<eos> But once you are there,<eos> everything disappears Completely<eos> There is no more gravity<eos> You elevate<eos> You dissolve<eos> The music This movement takes you away
You're sorry you can't do Latin with her.<eos> You don't want to be seen like this, right?<eos> Excuse me, five minutes.<eos> Another five minutes, then they'll kick me out.<eos> Anyway, I don't know why, but Livia's doing a little better in Latin.<eos> When you come home, she wants to brush-up with you.<eos> "Letting you stay a little longer, would be the best treatment".<eos> I know!<eos> Barry, listen!<eos> I want to remind you that in the previous scene, the workers contested you, shouted at you.
Vittorio, I'm shooting a film.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> It didn't work out for us, that's it.<eos> You don't care that your daughter suffered, all you care is she didn't tell you and you didn't realize.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> You think you're attentive but you don't see what's around you.<eos> People avoid you, they take you in small doses, they're not relaxed with you.<eos> You never like anything, even at work and you ruin things.<eos> It's the way I work.<eos> No, it's the way you live and make people who love you live that way too.
Hurst- - Hurst, you got my mask.<eos> Engel's down.<eos> ( COUGHING ) Engel, breathe.<eos> [JONES] Power supply rebooting.<eos> O2 levels increasing. It's stabilizing, breathe.<eos> Hurst, you're a little late.<eos> Bell's breathing system malfunctioned. We were taking in our own carbon dioxide.<eos> Two hours... how did we just lose two hours of breathing gas?<eos> We lost an external cylinder.<eos> I know we lost an external cylinder. I sent you out there to check for damage.
What happened?<eos> Hurst's in the water.<eos> Hurst's in the water. Hurst, come in.<eos> Over.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Hurst, what are you doing?<eos> HURST (OVER RADIO) I'm gonna fix things.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> HURST (OVER RADIO) I'm gonna find the ship.<eos> You are not authorized to be in the water. I am instructing you to return to the bell now.
Hurst, come in.<eos> It's going-<eos> - It's--.<eos> Should have Cut the gas.<eos> He's wasting vital air.<eos> We're not cutting off anybody's breathing supply.<eos> He's using three times the amount of air. The longer he's in the water, the less air we have.<eos> We don't decide who dies.<eos> Maybe you don't.<eos> One less breath in here could be the difference between you seeing your wife and children again or them seeing you in a box.
My rumpus room rascal.<eos> You have no idea the beast you are about to receive.<eos> Johanna?<eos> Are you all right in there, darling?<eos> It is I, Charlie.<eos> Your husband.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Moon of my delight.<eos> This is your own personalized Sheik of Araby who seeks admission into your tent.<eos> I have come to carry you off to the burning desert, and work my greasy will upon you... under the tropical stars.
My Sheik, does this mean you have excommunicated that moustache of the Prophet?<eos> I'll trim it.<eos> Darling, I am embarking on a very dangerous escapade from which I may not well return.<eos> And it is customary in these situations for, you know... a proper send-off.<eos> Quick session of congress.<eos> And by the way, did I mention... it is a matter of national security.<eos> It's very difficult for me as well, you know, this thing that's come between us.<eos> I know, darling.<eos> No, no. Steady yourself.<eos> I beg you, darling, please.
You think poor Miss Fellworthy stumbled into something, - and that's why she got killed.<eos> - I really can't say.<eos> This is interesting.<eos> Creates quite a market when a painting with a little mystery goes missing.<eos> So much to do. What was the name of Bronwen's college at Oxford?<eos> Johanna, I simply can't.<eos> Right. Sorry.<eos> Oh, golly. Look at the time.<eos> I really must be going.<eos> It was lovely to see you, Alastair.
Anonymously, of course.<eos> We may be flat broke, my darling, but we are not desperate.<eos> I do hope Romanov doesn't come down too hard on Sir Graham, when he finds out he bought the wrong fake.<eos> Lights.<eos> That is disappointing.<eos> Very disappointing.<eos> Open your balls.<eos> Bollocks.<eos> Now... tell me about that tramp on the horse.<eos> Oh, my darling, I tried desperately to be unfaithful to you, I really did.
- WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?<eos> - I JUST WANTED TO BE WITH MY FAMILY.<eos> - MAYA!<eos> JACK!<eos> MAYA!<eos> JACK!<eos> - HEY... HEY.<eos> - STOP!<eos> -l JUST WANT TO BE WITH MY FAMILY!<eos> -LF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO THEM... I AM SENDING THE POLICE STRAIGHT TO YOU!
Oh, please.<eos> I know you had a concussion and a few cracked ribs.<eos> Could have been much worse.<eos> Apparently it was a nasty car accident.<eos> Does your wife know that one of the missing agents you're looking for is Kate Hewson?<eos> Stallings:<eos> Ethan:<eos> Why open up old wounds?<eos> Anyway, it's classified.<eos> Well, it seems kind of strange that Hassler would choose you for this one.
[ Indistinct conversations ]<eos> Theresa:<eos> You've reached the Burkes.<eos> Sorry we aren't here to take your call unless you're a telemarketer.<eos> Then we are thrilled to have missed your call.<eos> Otherwise, leave a message.<eos> [ Beep ]<eos> Theresa, it's me.<eos> Uh, look.<eos> They probably already told you that I was in an accident.
[ Woman laughs ]<eos> You too.<eos> All right, Harold. I'm watchin'.<eos> [ Laughs ]<eos> It's not even close, don't worry.<eos> [ Laughing ] Okay.<eos> You got winners, right, Joe?<eos> [ Laughs ]<eos> Hey.<eos> Everyone's waiting for you in the conference room.
Well, I guess long-term-wise it's...<eos> It's been a while.<eos> - Since Pete, right?<eos> - Since Pete.<eos> Tom told me.<eos> Massive cock.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Huge.<eos> - It wasn't that big...<eos> - What he did to you.
- Are you a regular here?<eos> - Well, define "regular". What is it?<eos> - Hi, Jack.<eos> - Hey, Helen, how's it going?<eos> Oh, so you...<eos> Ah!<eos> Snap.<eos> - We're swapping, right?<eos> - Swapping?<eos> For the genius Six Billion Ways to get to know you list that you suggested.
Where'd you get that?<eos> - In my wallet.<eos> - Who took it?<eos> - I did.<eos> I don't remember you ever being in my bedroom.<eos> I wasn't in your bedroom, silly.<eos> I was outside. In a tree.<eos> - Jessica, watch and weep. - NANCY:<eos> OK.<eos> Why is he calling you Jessica?
- So you guys know each other?<eos> - We just went to school together.<eos> - Yeah, we're old friends.<eos> - We're old, old friends.<eos> We used to have a bit of a thing going on.<eos> - Good for you.<eos> - It was.<eos> It really wasn't that good.<eos> You never forget your first.<eos> Lovely to see you after all these years.
I just feel like... I feel hustled.<eos> Because I won?<eos> Are you not used to that?<eos> I'm not really used to losing at bowling.<eos> Oh, can't I keep them?<eos> You think it's the first time he's heard that?<eos> They're cute.<eos> Well, maybe tonight.<eos> Let's not forget this.<eos> Keep you nice and warm.
- No, wait.<eos> Please, let me explain.<eos> - You don't have to.<eos> I thought we had a connection but you still have something for Sean.<eos> I'm gonna leave you to whatever fucking weird shit...<eos> Jack, Jack, Jack.<eos> Just slide it on down to chills-ville.<eos> Don't be so harsh on Nancy.<eos> Who's Nancy?<eos> Why is he calling you Nancy?
Get up.<eos> Henry, right?<eos> - Please, don't.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> How do you like the new you?<eos> Did I interrupt the procedure?<eos> Can Henry not talk yet?<eos> - No, he can't.<eos> - Don't look at me like that, Henry.<eos> Your girlfriend here... might have rebuilt you, but I gave her the raw materials to work with.
I have lived these past years, Henry.<eos> My lads, they get speeding tickets, they walk barefoot through the grass, and boy, do they get laid.<eos> You'll never guess what we do here sometimes alone.<eos> Hit play. Over there.<eos> Go on.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> Close your eyes. Something's wrong with you.<eos> Don't worry, it's not the clap or nothing.<eos> Just gotta sit you down in this chair and take a look at you, yeah?
Each one's first memory will be his wife slipping a cheap brass ring on his finger.<eos> Every single one of my soldiers will awake willing to do anything my brilliant wife tells him, whether it's marching on Paris or the White House lawn.<eos> I would like to pretend you understand the part you played.<eos> You didn't make history, Henry.<eos> You helped end it.<eos> You... little... pussy.<eos> That's what my old man called me.<eos> It's like it was my name.<eos> And I proved him right by killing all the wrong people.<eos> I love you, Henry, and I'll never call you anything but your name, but you gotta decide... are you gonna lay there, swallow that blood in your mouth?

You pick him! You pick who's next!<eos> I'm next.<eos> Hey, I just need one round, bro.<eos> All right, you wanna warm up?<eos> I don't need no warm-up.<eos> Get my stuff.<eos> I see you got your head gear on.<eos> Good job.<eos> Don't run.<eos> Told you I'd win, man.
That's how good we gonna take care of you.<eos> - You like pickles?<eos> - Nah. Okay, mayonnaise.<eos> Put extra peppers on that jawn, both kinds.<eos> Ketchup, extra cheese.<eos> - How much I owe you?<eos> - $9.95.<eos> No, let me get these.<eos> That's cool.<eos> I asked you out, right?
- How much I owe you?<eos> - $9.95.<eos> No, let me get these.<eos> That's cool.<eos> I asked you out, right?<eos> You said it wasn't a date, though.<eos> It's not.<eos> Where we eating at?<eos> Right there.<eos> So I heard you back there, "jawn" this, "jawn" that.
I mean, you're in shape and all but...<eos> I don't know. Aren't most boxers like...<eos> - Like what?<eos> - Like street.<eos> I'm not saying you're a square or anything, but I'm just curious, what made you wanna fight?<eos> My pop was a fighter.<eos> Oh, right. That makes sense.<eos> Did he fight pro?<eos> Something like that.<eos> Does he train you?
I didn't get a chance to tell you, but I'm gonna be living with my uncle for a while, training for the next fight.<eos> That's your uncle?<eos> He's white.<eos> Yeah, a long time.<eos> He's gonna be staying with me, and when we ain't training you're welcome to come on over.<eos> Cool, thank you.<eos> It's nice to meet you.<eos> Why you giving me that look?<eos> When were you gonna tell me that your uncle's Rocky Balboa?<eos> I'm gonna call you.
Double jab.<eos> Go ahead over the top.<eos> Right hook here.<eos> Over here.<eos> One step at a time, one punch at a time, one round at a time.<eos> One step at a time, one punch at a time, one round at a time.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Fast, pop it fast.<eos> I want you to let it all out.<eos> Now go right here. Everyone's ever disrespected you, see them.
Take a break.<eos> Hey, Unc, you all right?<eos> - You okay?<eos> I'm all right. It's out.<eos> Just let me walk.<eos> Just... I'm good. - Sure?<eos> What's wrong with you? I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just let me walk.<eos> No, we got to call someone and get you to the doctor, okay? - Okay.
He was fighting with the other inmates.<eos> Oh, no. Anybody get hurt?<eos> Nah, nothing life-threatening.<eos> - All right, thank you.<eos> - No problem, champ. Yeah.<eos> How you doing, son?<eos> I know a lot of cops and they said, "Your friend's locked up."<eos> Friends?<eos> You're just a trainer to me, right?<eos> I'm sorry about what I said to you, back at the gym.
To your corner! One! Perfect uppercut on the inside.<eos> - Down goes Creed.<eos> - Three! Four! - I'm good.<eos> Shake it off!<eos> But already a knockdown for Ricky Conlan.<eos> - Are you okay? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> Fight!<eos> Conlan lands a shot after the bell, and round one was all Ricky Conlan.<eos> Real for you now, boy?
I never got a chance to thank Apollo for helping me out after Mickey died.<eos> But it's nothing compared to what you've done.<eos> You taught me how to fight again and I'm gonna go home and I'm gonna fight this thing.<eos> But if I fight, I want you to fight, too.<eos> I want you to go across this ring and knock that son of a bitch down. Can you do it?<eos> Say it.<eos> I'm gonna knock that son of a bitch down.<eos> I know you are.<eos> You know why? Because you're a Creed and I love you, kid.<eos> - I love you too. - Go on.
What?<eos> Do I mean that?<eos> You got me. You kidder.<eos> You sucker!<eos> No.<eos> You should have seen your face!<eos> You were like....<eos> Fine, I'm sorry if I....<eos> Don't be.<eos> God, I admire you.
Do I mean that?<eos> You got me. You kidder.<eos> You sucker!<eos> No.<eos> You should have seen your face!<eos> You were like....<eos> Fine, I'm sorry if I....<eos> Don't be.<eos> God, I admire you.<eos> "I admire you"?
I'll catch you later.<eos> You go have a great time.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're a lot furrier than I thought you'd be.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Smell you later, pal.<eos> Hey, Coop.<eos> All those things you said about me to De Luca.... Did you mean that?<eos> God, I admire you.
Lance gets a private jet.<eos> Lance... and his fuckin' cancer shield so no one can say a fuckin' word about it.<eos> And the rest of us, we work our asses off to get him over the line, to clear a fucking path for him, to take the win for him.<eos> And now this.<eos> We're a cycling team, selling our bikes, to pay for drugs.<eos> I didn't sign up for this.<eos> Look, Floyd... if you think you'd be happier on another team... your contract expires at the end of the season.<eos> We both know you're good.<eos> And one day you'll win.<eos> And I can help you.
Tie him up!<eos> Reel him in!<eos> Get the urn!<eos> - Hand it to me!<eos> - Here.<eos> Now let's get out of here.<eos> Help me move this thing.<eos> You are everything your legend foretold, Scorpion King.<eos> - You're betraying me.<eos> - I've followed you long enough.
I invented this.<eos> We call it the Man Kettle.<eos> We like to see what bubbles up first, the truth or the tea.<eos> Now, I'm trying to understand why you would come here, pretending to make peace with my father.<eos> I don't lie.<eos> You know that.<eos> You're a warrior and a killer.<eos> Aren't you the wrong man to come here to offer us peace?<eos> That's exactly what I told King Zakkour.<eos> But he sent you anyway.

Sorry.<eos> Father, he's got something to show you.<eos> It's the reason I brought him here.<eos> Show him.<eos> Well, that's very pretty.<eos> All it needs is a giant, golden key ring.<eos> It's the Golden Key of Lord Alcaman.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> You told me about it as a child.<eos> I also told you that Lord Alcaman and all his grand powers didn't exist.
I want more grog!<eos> Why are we here again?<eos> He's got to be around here somewhere.<eos> My, my, my.<eos> Sugar love.<eos> You said I'd see you on the outside, and here you are.<eos> Yes.<eos> This is my father, Sorrell.<eos> And you remember my other friend from the castle, don't you?<eos> Yeah, they're calling you "the King Slayer."
Yeah, no kidding.<eos> So?<eos> What?<eos> The fight.<eos> I've been preparing for this for a long time.<eos> My destiny.<eos> I understand that.<eos> So?<eos> What?<eos> Why do they call you the Scorpion King?
I am Chief Onus, leader of the Tugarin tribe and protector of this forest.<eos> Praise the great spirit of this forest.<eos> We give you the souls of these trespassers so that you may smile down upon us with all your bounty!<eos> What are they doing?<eos> Preparing us for sacrifice.<eos> To what?<eos> I'm guessing whatever's in that box.<eos> Father!<eos> I love you!<eos> I love you, too, Valina.
But what's the point?<eos> Many reasons.<eos> Like?<eos> Music.<eos> Being loved by your amazing mother.<eos> None of you know what you're doing.<eos> You all pretend to have a plan for us, but everyone's just either greedy or desperate.<eos> Why did you have me?<eos> When you knew the world was so bad and you had to struggle so much.<eos> You're all alone with no one to help you.

What's wrong?<eos> I don't really know why I'm alive.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> Whatever you do will be wonderful and worthwhile.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I know because you're kind.<eos> People say being kind is being weak.<eos> You're alive because of energy and empathy.<eos> Your mother had so much of it inside of her, she needed to get it out.<eos> So she made you.
I'm standing in a parking lot at Twin Pines Mall.<eos> It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m.<eos> And this is temporal experiment number one. -...and total immersification.<eos> It's just bursting at the seams with pipe.<eos> - The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.<eos> - Where the hell are they?<eos> - The appropriate question is when the hell are they?<eos> - You're being told so many facts for the first quarter of that movie simply so that the Sudoku can complete itself.<eos> - This readout tells you where you're going.<eos> This one tells you where you are.
It's nice to examine what's underneath the skin.<eos> This is our first DCS, me and Meghan.<eos> Meghan, please come on up.<eos> Come on. Don't be shy.<eos> She's very shy.<eos> So come on, Meghan. Come on.<eos> -[Meghan] I didn't know he was planning anything.<eos> I was just excited to go see the play.<eos> So it was definitely a big surprise to me.<eos> - Meghan, I love you more than anything in the entire world.
- What's that thing he's on?<eos> -It's a board with wheels.<eos> - He's an absolute dream.<eos> -[Adam F. Goldberg] I remember my mom came back from the movie theater and said to me, "I just saw this amazing movie called 'Back to the Future.'<eos> "It's about a boy who goes back and falls in love with his morn."<eos> And it was so interesting to me.<eos> I was like, "That sounds terrible."<eos> Because as a kid with an overbearing, Jewish mother,<eos> I'm like, "Who would make a movie like that?"<eos> - I love you so much.

Fair girls are on me, you know.<eos> Don't get it twisted, bruv.<eos> Hey, 11-up, come here.<eos> - No, you don't. You don't get girls.<eos> - I do get 'em. I get girls.<eos> Guys. This is Emily.<eos> Cyberchick.<eos> It's nice to meet you.<eos> See, we thought you was a man.<eos> Not when we saw you, obviously.
It's official.<eos> Legacy is the future.<eos> Sorry, Damien.<eos> Kelsey says, "Still naked and loving it."<eos> I'm guessing she's talking about her time at Legacy.<eos> Guys, uh, anyone know if there's a cash machine around here?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> We really need to start locking that door.<eos> You didn't think I'd forgotten about you, did you?
Because I found it.<eos> Look at this girl.<eos> She's a butter everything.<eos> She'd be hot "but her everything".<eos> Hey, Frank, serious question.<eos> Have you ever seen yourself, like, in a mirror?<eos> Because actually, on a Frank scale, that girl's, like, a hundred Franks.<eos> And on the Mary Ellen scale, she's about half a Mary Ellen.<eos> That's a compliment, what you've just said.<eos> Mine actually was not a compliment to you.
Bump!<eos> Yes!<eos> Danny, I'm so happy you are staying.<eos> This is going to be the best last weekend ever.<eos> No one can touch us.<eos> We're never gonna die.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Hold on, hold on, hold on, for, like, two seconds here.<eos> Danny.<eos> Krystal Manicucci brought you back to her house and you didn't bang that?
No one can touch us.<eos> We're never gonna die.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Hold on, hold on, hold on, for, like, two seconds here.<eos> Danny.<eos> Krystal Manicucci brought you back to her house and you didn't bang that?<eos> This is the shit I'm talking about.<eos> Fucking Irish guys, man.<eos> Okay. Can we focus on the party?<eos> Or, like, anything that will keep you from talking?
He's got a boner.<eos> A what?<eos> I have a boner, that's true.<eos> But it's about Rachel.<eos> Frank, that's disgusting.<eos> And you!<eos> I'm the manager.<eos> Put some clothes on.<eos> What's wrong with you, perv?<eos> Frank, I literally left you alone in the big pool for 10 minutes.
I don't want you hanging out with my daughter.<eos> I'm not, I promise.<eos> I was just inviting her to a party.<eos> But she doesn't want to go.<eos> A party? What kind of a party?<eos> A sex party?<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no, I don't do sex parties.<eos> You lying piece of shit.<eos> I saw you in the deli today, buying condoms.
I'll get in the truck.<eos> I'll get in the truck.<eos> All right, give me your parents' money.<eos> Let's go, guys.<eos> Whoa, Sofia, high roller.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> Bets are closed, guys.<eos> Two to one odds on Mikey Calcags.<eos> You're a punk, Mikey.<eos> Nobody likes you.
Being a twin sucks.<eos> You know that?<eos> Yes. I understand what it's like to be compared to other people.<eos> Being fat sucks, too.<eos> So does staying home from college, especially when your best friend's going to Harvard.<eos> You're not fat.<eos> And you're really, really beautiful.<eos> You're gorgeous.<eos> And I did think you were Rachel at first. But I'm really happy you're not.<eos> And honestly, I feel really lucky that I even got to kiss you.
It was very fun.<eos> I'm really sorry I missed it.<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> I overreacted.<eos> I just...<eos> All right.<eos> Oh! Oh, my baby.<eos> I'm gonna miss you.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Are you sure you still want us to drive you up?
No.<eos> Sir, speaking of the school... What are we going to do about that?<eos> I need to report to the director of education that there is no school in this village.<eos> We'll go to the town hall tomorrow and tell him about our predicament.<eos> Our government sent a teacher here, that means it will build a school as well.<eos> It's as simple as that.<eos> You can't go to the town hall tomorrow.<eos> The bus comes only once every three days.<eos> -What do you mean?<eos> -Yeah. Sir, it took them 30 years to send you.
Ankara is in chaos.<eos> All hell is breaking loose.<eos> With the grace of God, our glorious military, will bring a new order to our country.<eos> By the way, sir, I have some advice for you.<eos> It would be for the best if you cited the absence of a school as an excuse and went back home.<eos> They say every dark cloud has a silver lining.<eos> Don't be sad. It wasn't meant to be.<eos> I'm sad to be leaving too, but there's nothing I can do.<eos> Damn this poverty, sir.<eos> Oh, how the kids' eyes sparkled when they saw you...
Knock it off!<eos> -Have you seen Aziz?<eos> -Yeah, he went that way.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Aziz, what are you doing?<eos> God damn you!<eos> -Aziz!<eos> -Aziz!<eos> Stop!<eos> How many times have we told you not to run around naked in the village?
I'm telling you.<eos> My son is handicapped.<eos> Send your family for the arrangements.<eos> My daughter is now yours.<eos> Alright.<eos> Aziz, son.<eos> Aziz, son.<eos> Now, listen to me very carefully.<eos> Would you like to get married?<eos> I've found a girl for you.
She's body down."<eos> I don't know what that means, but, like, I can't do that... because, like, you and I won't ever see each other again.<eos> I didn't think you were gonna follow up so quick about hanging out, but this is it for us.<eos> Well, but--<eos> Our journey is over.<eos> Like it just ends here-- Till Saturday.<eos> No-- Our journey is over now... because I probably won't see you because I gotta get to work... and you gotta go be fine as hell. Good-bye.<eos> I got Bikram yoga, so--<eos> Hey, you can say whatever you want, baby, but hips don't lie.<eos> Hey, check your Twitter. I might Direct Message you.
That guy is, like, so hot.<eos> He looks kind of like a white Drake.<eos> No. He was like a Puerto Rican Gollum.<eos> I'm not talking about it.<eos> Do you have to pee?<eos> Yeah, totally.<eos> Did you hear Johnny Depp is coming into the office today?<eos> Oh, yeah. I'm all over that.<eos> Which version of Johnny Depp you most wanna have sex with?<eos> Like, which one does it for you the most?
Just write them all down.<eos> Okay.<eos> I like you, Amy.<eos> I do, you know. You're clever, but you're not too brainy.<eos> You're pretty-ish and you're not gorgeous.<eos> You're approachable.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I want this promotion for you, Amy, you know? Yeah.<eos> I want you to help me to help you.
It's Portuguese.<eos> Rolm's teaching me.<eos> That's our son Rolm.<eos> We adopted him about six months ago.<eos> Yeah, we've been teaching him, but really, he's been teaching us.<eos> Yeah. How to protect ourselves. How to stand up for ourselves.<eos> - He has night terrors.<eos> - Lotta lessons really quick.<eos> He's a very strong presence in our house.<eos> Um, we love you.
But raise your hand if he was one of your favorite people.<eos> He was my favorite person.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You all right?<eos> This makes me wish they'd found my father's remains.<eos> Hey.<eos> Mother, can we go to La Poubelle now?<eos> Yeah. Sure, honey.<eos> How about a piece of pizza?<eos> So Mom doesn't have to take you to a French restaurant.
No. I got-- I got the metaphor.<eos> 'Cause with the dance, I wanna show you, like, us.<eos> Yeah, I got the metaphor.<eos> 'Cause, like, I really wanna try. Yeah.<eos> I wanna try with you.<eos> I wanna try too.<eos> I love you.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I love you too, Amy.
No and no.<eos> I have no money, no passport... one thousand.<eos> American.<eos> I assume you'll take a personal check.<eos> I assume you'll take a bullet to the foot.<eos> Look, Mr. Bombay... or, uh, do you go by "Mumbai" now?<eos> Twenty-four hours.<eos> You pay me or you die.<eos> You don't deserve a talent like that.<eos> She begged you to let her sing her own songs.
You think we didn't think about this?<eos> Obviously we did. We thought about you.<eos> And then we thought about your current situation.<eos> Look, rich, the us embassy, if pushed, can issue... What they like to call a "limited-validity" passport.<eos> Like right now. Ahora.<eos> Rightthefucknow .<eos> We can have it in your hands tonight.<eos> No questions asked.<eos> No.<eos> Like I said, we can and will make that happen for you.
- Sam--<eos> - Lainey.<eos> My therapist suggested I attend a twelve step program, for recovery from a love addiction and romantic obsession<eos> - I'm sorry um, hello...<eos> Did you say love addiction? and romantic obsession...<eos> - Sweetie, you might as well face it, you're addicted to love.<eos> Huey Lewis.<eos> - No, it's Robert Palmer.<eos> ...that I've had for the last ten years.<eos> As a result I have been able to stay faithful to you -for the past six months-

Jesus... I've got my fingers crossed out here for an option C.<eos> C) You appease her.<eos> And how do you appease your Khaleesi?<eos> I spend about a month's rent on this.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Yeah, I mean you should definitely wear stuff over it.<eos> Nice neg. Mousetrap.<eos> Hey, you've reached Lainey.<eos> Leave a message. Hey dude, It's me.<eos> I haven't heard from you in a while so I'm gonna guess you either finally fucked Jake or you got into med school.
- She's twenty-two, she'll fuck anyone.<eos> Wait.<eos> I'm sorry, no. Serious, she's probably fucked everyone in here but I don't even care.<eos> You got a minute? Not really.<eos> I'm kind of in the middle of something.<eos> I was thinking...<eos> Oh yeah? Do you wanna come to Henry's birthday party this weekend?<eos> Really?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Xander, in the eight years I've known you as a father you have never once invited me to any function involving your children.
Yes.<eos> Good.<eos> What's up?<eos> Are we in love with each other?<eos> What are we gonna do about it?<eos> What do you want to do?<eos> Nothing.<eos> There's nothing to do.<eos> I love you for free, Lainey.<eos> I love you for free, Jake.
Oh my God, Oh my God, No! No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Matthew! Hey!<eos> Hey! He didn't do anything.<eos> We were just having brunch and then this fucker comes out of nowhere and decks him!<eos> The Henley wearing bullshit motherfucker!<eos> Oh my god, this isn't happening.<eos> I need a tissue...<eos> - They're going to book you for assault.
Don't grind up on me, weirdo.<eos> There's not even music.<eos> Really? There's music in my body.<eos> - Okay, now something's happening. Let's get out of here.<eos> Let's go back to the hotel.<eos> I want to do stuff to your body.<eos> Upstairs. Downstairs. Right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> I love you, honey.
Carlos, good morning.<eos> Hello, Mercedes.<eos> Change the meeting with the real estate people to 11.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Yes, call head office and get them to send you the papers on the new application plans.<eos> Okay?<eos> - Okay, see you soon.<eos> Did you tell your boyfriend you're flirting with another guy?<eos> No, but I'll tell him you wet the bed every night.<eos> Mom told you not to joke about it.
- Coming.<eos> Put this on him.<eos> I'm sorry, Marcos.<eos> - Sara, please!<eos> I can't reach!<eos> You put the tourniquet on!<eos> What's going on? !<eos> I don't know.<eos> What did you do to him? ! Look at Marcos.<eos> Why is this guy calling you?
I called you at your office but they said you weren't in.<eos> My son had a slight accident.<eos> They told me.<eos> I hope he's alright.<eos> Your voice is weird. Is it serious?<eos> No, it's not serious.<eos> He seems okay now.<eos> Glad to hear it.<eos> Listen, did you take care of what we talked about?<eos> Yes, I was just about to call you.
What about the witnesses to the explosion today?<eos> One identified the suspect at the site of the explosion. Moments later, he left.<eos> I want to talk to the wife.<eos> She's with the lawyer.<eos> Get them both to come.<eos> Carlos.<eos> I'm coming over to give you some water and a first aid kit, okay?<eos> It's only water and...<eos> - Don't talk to me.<eos> And remember, I'm watching you.
Is it true what they're saying about the bomb?<eos> I can't talk now.<eos> Good God, Carlos, I don't know what's going on.<eos> Only you do, and I hope you know what you're doing.<eos> I must ask if there's been any actions against the bank.<eos> Alejandro, I can't talk.<eos> I need you to confirm that you're aware of the protocol.<eos> I know the protocol.<eos> Okay.<eos> I therefore inform you that the bank will not be responsible for your actions.
Quick, we have to get him to hospital.<eos> Let go of me! Let go!<eos> Sara, for God's sake. Please!<eos> Let go of me!<eos> - I'm letting go!<eos> No, no!<eos> What have you done?<eos> Let his mother get in.<eos> What have you done?<eos> I'm not leaving you here, Dad!
Why didn't she say anything to me?<eos> About things being bad?<eos> Some things you just see.<eos> Mom's had a hard time.<eos> Maybe they're just friends.<eos> We don't know for sure.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Carlos, Carlos, I'm here to help you.
The Grandma and Grandpa could come.<eos> Jack, they don't know where we are.<eos> Room's not on any map.<eos> Jack, listen to me.<eos> Now we got a chance.<eos> We've nearly missed it but we got our chance.<eos> So, you're gonna help me.<eos> You're gonna help me trick Old Nick.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> I'm going to make your face so hot... that Old Nick will have to take you to the hospital in his truck... and then when you get there you're gonna say to the doctors, Help! Police!
And he lays in there really still until the guards come.<eos> Cause that's what you're gonna do.<eos> You see?<eos> How that's even tricksier than pretending to be sick.<eos> Because you're gonna... Play dead.<eos> Folding over.<eos> - I don't want to be dead.<eos> - You're just pretending to be dead.<eos> Stay stiff.<eos> We're gonna roll you up in rug so that Old Nick won't see you.
And behind all the door there's another inside.<eos> And another outside.<eos> And things happen, happen, happen, it never stops.<eos> Plus... the world's always changing brightness and hotness.<eos> And there's invisible germs floating everywhere.<eos> When I was small I only knew small things, but now I'm five I know everything.<eos> - We're walking out on this?<eos> - Come on sweety, it's ok, just pick him up.<eos> - Come here, Jack.<eos> - We love you, Jack.
What?<eos> I love you.<eos> You don't love me?<eos> I do.<eos> You don't love me.<eos> I... - No!<eos> No, no, you don't love me.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you so much.
You're drunk.<eos> I'm not drunk.<eos> I mean, we get along pretty well. Don't you think? I think we do.<eos> That's not the point, that you get along with her.<eos> That's not the point.<eos> The point is that you fucked my daughter, and so you're gonna marry her. That's the point.<eos> Mom.<eos> What?<eos> It's true, right? He porked you?<eos> He porked you, and so now he's gotta marry you!
Let me in and I'll give it you.<eos> Show it to me.<eos> There's no time.<eos> Come on. Come on. Come on.<eos> I'm counting.<eos> They're after me.<eos> Who's after you?<eos> You didn't bring the gobshack cops here, did you?<eos> No, they're fucking cleaners, serious goddamn cleaners.<eos> Why should I help you?
You know, that leg is going to pop.<eos> And when it does, it's only a matter of time before the gangrene sets in.<eos> Green's always been my best color. Good.<eos> Just as.<eos> Again.<eos> Tie it up.<eos> Where is the drive?<eos> All right.<eos> What's in it for me?<eos> If I help you, what's in it for me?
I wanna come home, Claire.<eos> Let me come home.<eos> Please.<eos> Just get out.<eos> Get out!<eos> Don't tell me Dad's not coming back. Don't tell me that.<eos> Kevin, wait.<eos> Kevin?<eos> Claire.<eos> I love you like a sister, but you have got to get those divorce papers signed and move on.
Okay<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Cool.<eos> All right. It was nice meeting you.<eos> You, too.<eos> Uncle Bob'?<eos> Are you gonna be okay?<eos> Yeah, sure, I'm fine.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Hey. Love you.
Yeah, they thought I couldn't do the job.<eos> Were they right?<eos> Eight square blocks of downtown Manhattan say otherwise.<eos> So, this hidden group,<eos> Ryan infiltrated them, but you didn't?<eos> So, you're on the outside now?<eos> Depends on your perspective.<eos> I may not be with the FBI, but I'm still at The Farm, rising up on the Murder Board.<eos> Well, if you wanted to simply be in the CIA, that would be fine, but you don't.<eos> You want to solve the riddle of the terror threat that's growing inside of something neither you nor I are a part of, but something you still know next to nothing about.
Doesn't feel like the right thing.<eos> This is a game-changer for us, the step-up that we needed.<eos> You said that there were three of you.<eos> Did you pull the trigger?<eos> No.<eos> That was León.<eos> - Then somebody up there likes you. - Yeah.<eos> The suspects, those fellow recruits, the ones you thought were part of this AIC at The Farm, how did you know who they were?<eos> They all got special phones.<eos> And you didn't?
No.<eos> That was León.<eos> - Then somebody up there likes you. - Yeah.<eos> The suspects, those fellow recruits, the ones you thought were part of this AIC at The Farm, how did you know who they were?<eos> They all got special phones.<eos> And you didn't?<eos> - Still no contact from the AIC phone? - No.<eos> Has Owen approached you?<eos> And your fellow insurgents, how are they holding up after what you all did?<eos> Better than you, I hope.
Has he told you any more about who he killed?<eos> No, but he said it's for my own good.<eos> That's a good sign.<eos> He wants to protect you from it.<eos> Which means he is starting to develop feelings for me.<eos> For Jane.<eos> And I think when he does open up next, he's gonna give me actual details.<eos> He's more vulnerable now.<eos> I agree.<eos> Just make sure you remember who you need to be, because if he finds out about Shelby Wyatt, both you and Jane will be in danger.
Your mission at the Gold Leaf... seduce your targets and get as many numbers as you can.<eos> What was your approach?<eos> Being Alex Parrish.<eos> Celebrity works.<eos> I've already got Stephanie, Courtney, and, um, Samantha.<eos> I'm still working on Jeanne, but she'll fold.<eos> I agree.<eos> You look comfortable, so they feel relaxed.<eos> Perfect approach.<eos> Clearly, being Alex Parrish works for you.
What? !<eos> There it is!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> All right, boys.<eos> Put your numbers in my phone.<eos> Don't complain. Them's the rules.<eos> Yes, bruv!<eos> Well done, Harry.<eos> Sometimes all it takes is getting everyone's eyes on you.
Very impressive, Ryan.<eos> Using an advanced neuro-linguistic programming technique designed to produce a rush of endorphins.<eos> Once the hand leaves the subject... a sense of connection with the instigator forms.<eos> Touch... is a proven way to get someone to trust you.<eos> You just sabotaged me.<eos> I sure did.<eos> Um, you see, we're not partners anymore.<eos> So it's each man for himself.<eos> You still gonna go after the AIC?<eos> Are you?
Sure.<eos> It's a deal.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Hey, excuse me.<eos> This is my really good friend, Ryan, and he's a nice guy.<eos> You can trust him.<eos> I promise.<eos> Yeah. Thanks.<eos> Okay, enough.<eos> Ryan being a flirt, you helping him, your song on the jukebox...
All right, evidence is evidence.<eos> Just because you don't see how it fits doesn't mean it's not important.<eos> Did you read that on a tea bag?<eos> All right, just...<eos> if you would just listen.<eos> I'm just about to get to Owen Hall.<eos> That's what really matters.<eos> Owen Hall matters?<eos> The guy who's safely in federal prison.<eos> I don't have a number you can get.
- Time to wrap this up.<eos> - Owen.<eos> Not exactly the Mata Hari moves I was expecting, Alex.<eos> Tonight was the kiddie pool.<eos> Now it's time to swim in some deep waters.<eos> Tomorrow night, you're going to the Estate nightclub at The Scott hotel in Philadelphia to attend the post-rehearsal dinner party of a lovely young couple about to get married.<eos> You'll be assigned your mark amongst the wedding guests when you arrive.<eos> Your goal... to seduce them.<eos> You make them feel so comfortable they're willing to spend the night with you and wake up with them after.<eos> Someone who falls asleep next to you is willing to show they're vulnerable, and a vulnerable mark will talk in ways no one you cold-bump into in a bar ever will.
That's what's happening right now.<eos> Okay, well, that is a new one on me.<eos> I'm gonna go get Miranda.<eos> Wait.<eos> She's here?<eos> She didn't answer my last call.<eos> You called her?<eos> She didn't tell you?<eos> I'll find her.<eos> Okay. I'm... I'm coming with you.
You pay attention.<eos> I'd think twice if I met someone who only wanted to hear me talk, who never want to talk about themselves.<eos> Never pushes back, you know?<eos> Your mark's on the move.<eos> You've been staring.<eos> And so have you.<eos> I just don't know why.<eos> I'll tell you why... if you can keep up with me.<eos> Hi.<eos> I was just thinking about you.
Bethesda.<eos> I know an out-of-the-way motel.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> See you then.<eos> Ooh, Carly Klapp.<eos> Well, that's one lucky lady with a very unfortunate name.<eos> So, what's the holdup?<eos> She looks wholesome enough.<eos> She's even wearing a cross.<eos> That's good for you.

Go away, Harry.<eos> You know how good-looking you are, right?<eos> This should be easy for you, Sebastian, but it's not.<eos> It never is, because you can't go in cold and calculated like this.<eos> You thought you could with the torture, but that tore you up inside.<eos> That's why you went to that retreat.<eos> Nobody should have to defend basic, human decency.<eos> No, I agree, and yet, here we are again.<eos> And again, you can't keep your virtue here, mate.<eos> You have to cross lines, because if you don't, that makes you a danger to everyone around you.

James has a history of talking to very beautiful women.<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> How about I stay here and make him jealous?<eos> How jealous?<eos> As jealous as you want.<eos> Del Maguey, neat, please.<eos> Water back.<eos> I didn't take you for the mezcal type.<eos> And I didn't think Uncle Sam covered bar tabs.<eos> These... are on you.
These... are on you.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> - So...<eos> Or on me, which is why I was getting up.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You know what?<eos> Just drink this instead.<eos> Go on.<eos> Water's good for you.
Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> You're good?<eos> You lied to me.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> I got to be honest with you.
Is everything okay?<eos> I got to be honest with you.<eos> I'm not sure that I can afford you.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You mean, you're not...<eos> My God.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> I just...<eos> I just figured you were...<eos> Well, for someone like you to be interested in someone like me...
Now, you know you're not the first recruit to try to get ahead by going after the instructor.<eos> But ju... You...<eos> You are the first one to not take no for an answer.<eos> Sit down.<eos> You look awful.<eos> You're pissed at me?<eos> I'm pissed at your assumption.<eos> I just... I thought you were different.<eos> No, you couldn't have thought I was that different, 'cause... you're here, trying to make this story end the way it did for you last time.<eos> You think I want something from you, and the only way I can get it - is to sleep with you. - Hey.

Shh! Calm down!<eos> Hey, at least he's not dead.<eos> But I wanted him to be.<eos> I wanted him to be.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm going downstairs.<eos> In a place like this, the bartender will have Rohypnol.<eos> He'll sell, no questions asked.<eos> This guy will not remember a thing, okay?<eos> You and I need to talk.
I got waylaid.<eos> Yeah, well, I waited at some creepy Motel 6 for two hours before I realized you weren't coming.<eos> Jane, we've known each other for, what, a month now?<eos> That's not a long time, right?<eos> We met at a diner.<eos> We...<eos> We... We spent a holiday together.<eos> I've told you things about my life I haven't even told my own family.<eos> It's not normal for me.<eos> Something doesn't add up. Something about you.

Something about you.<eos> Just because I'm interested in you?
I mean, y-you sleep with me, you pull back, you leave me wanting more, and the whole time, y-you're searching and you're... and you're digging.<eos> I mean, who are you, really?<eos> W-What are you hiding from me?<eos> I know that you have skeletons in your closet.<eos> So do I, but I don't press you about yours, because I know you need someone who's not gonna judge you.<eos> That is what I need, too.<eos> Look, it's okay that we met, and it's moving fast.<eos> You're different from anyone I've ever know.<eos> I-I can't explain it, but it's just...<eos> I know that I feel safe when I'm around you, and I hope you do, too.

She, um...<eos> She lives in L.A.<eos> I've been to her church.<eos> But... none of that matters because...<eos> I woke up with someone who... who thought I was a good person.<eos> And... And I'm not.<eos> So, what I did...<eos> What I did was... It wasn't good.<eos> I d... I did it just to prove to myself I could.<eos> And to prove it to you.
No, just give her a head start.<eos> I hate to admit it, but she's the only one who can end this.<eos> I'm so gonna regret it.<eos> They took away the mattress.<eos> They're rolling this whole place up tomorrow.<eos> Well, then, no one will know what happened in here.<eos> That's a little sad.<eos> Well, we know.<eos> Top of the Murder Board?<eos> And you?
I lied.<eos> Well, Miranda was right.<eos> Yes, she was, but you lied, too.<eos> You're really not gonna give this up, are you?<eos> Why should I, Ryan?<eos> This was my assignment first.<eos> So I'm not letting it go till it's done.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well... we promised each other we'd tell the truth in here, and since it's our last night, I hope you don't mind what I'm about to say.<eos> They chose me, Alex, not you.
Previously on iZombie...<eos> The Scratching Post.<eos> Let's get up and running.<eos> We don't have any customers yet.<eos> Make some.<eos> Do like our name says, "Scratch"<eos> It won't be long before you have an episode too severe for that inhaler to help.<eos> I've developed a serum that could potentially undo the memory loss that accompanies the second zombie cure.<eos> You should find someone to keep an eye on you.
Can I print this list out on your printer?<eos> Yeah sure, go crazy.<eos> This brain.<eos> I'm just, scrambled...<eos> Oh, speaking of which, how're those eggs coming, maestro?<eos> It's getting there.<eos> Sage... Where's the sage?<eos> Sage?<eos> That woman slapped you because you slept with her husband?<eos> After all I do for you, you go out and just screw some random guy, and his name is Sage?
What else did you see?<eos> That wasn't enough?<eos> Finally.<eos> You got the stuff?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry, lots of detective stuff, so it took a while.<eos> Wipes.<eos> The police place is disgusting.<eos> Enhanced water.<eos> I got one for you, too.
Mind if I down some of this Pad Thai first?<eos> I'm gonna need the energy.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Funny man.<eos> So I dropped by the morgue today.<eos> I needed some information on a case from Ravi.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, Ravi came at me with this whole elaborate conspiracy theory that you've been faking your memory loss this whole time.<eos> I'm starting to think that guy has a crush on you.
So?<eos> So, what?<eos> It's not true, is it?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, I didn't even think you expected an answer.<eos> Right.<eos> I mean, it doesn't even matter anyway.<eos> What doesn't matter?<eos> It's just...<eos> This is you, right?
So, what?<eos> It's not true, is it?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, I didn't even think you expected an answer.<eos> Right.<eos> I mean, it doesn't even matter anyway.<eos> What doesn't matter?<eos> It's just...<eos> This is you, right?<eos> 'Cause if this version is the real you, then does it matter how we got here?
We'd seriously thought we lost you this time.<eos> It's good to be home.<eos> I'll tell you guys everything, just let me jump in the shower and then we can celebrate.<eos> Actually, this can't wait.<eos> Someone stole all the remaining doses of the cure from my office.<eos> - Someone stole...<eos> - Well, let's not dwell on that.<eos> I gave you a syringe a few weeks back.<eos> It's the last one, and we need it for Liv.<eos> Do you have it with you?
Do you cook for all your neighbors or were Wally and Anna special?<eos> They lived right next door to me.<eos> Sometimes you get sucked in your neighbors' drama.<eos> Wally's father was a bit of a nightmare.<eos> Get out here, Wally! Did you do this?<eos> Leave him alone, Rick.<eos> You have a problem.<eos> I don't have a problem!<eos> You're the problem here! You!<eos> I'm trying to teach this boy how to be a man and you're babying him!
I can see how you might become their "in case of emergency."<eos> Anything comes up, let me know asap, all right?<eos> Of course.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sounds like Cavanaugh is starting his investigation at Fillmore-graves.<eos> Let's give it a day before we head over there.<eos> Better we don't cross paths.<eos> You can't stay mad at me forever, jelly bean.<eos> There is literally nothing more annoying than you calling me jelly bean.
Actually, I was thinking of getting my memory cure dialed in if you can hold on long enough.<eos> But I wouldn't put anything past Blaine.<eos> Sorry. Any mention of Blaine hurtles me into the abyss.<eos> Peyton left me a message saying she wants to talk.<eos> She wants to talk?<eos> What does that even mean?<eos> Well, I'm fairly certain it means she wants to talk.<eos> Okay, is she the single most selfish person on the planet?<eos> She literally made you Eskimo brothers with Satan.<eos> - She doesn't deserve face time with you.
Oh, my god!<eos> Was that just so super bitchy?<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Oh, good god.<eos> It just really hurts me when someone hurts you, you know?<eos> You're like my best friend ever.<eos> For real.<eos> Wait.<eos> We're totally best friends, right?<eos> It is so you and Peyton. Oh!
Oh, we came up empty.<eos> But this guy right here.<eos> You cannot believe how good he is at interviewing people.<eos> We talked to all of Stan's coworkers.<eos> Everybody loved him.<eos> What did they say he was again?<eos> Enthusiastic and supportive.<eos> The memory on this guy.<eos> See, I know what's happening right now with the brain but it still freaks me out.<eos> Well, if anyone can get used to it, it's you.
That's a good idea.<eos> I had a thought about our interview with Cindy's friend but I'm not so sure this one is a good idea at all.<eos> Murder?<eos> I thought it was an accident.<eos> Everyone at school said it was a hit-and-run.<eos> The evidence suggests there was intention.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> That second matchbook should've done the trick.<eos> Good to go.<eos> We have reason to believe you and Cindy were on the outs. What?
I mean, your vision?<eos> A photo of a sleeping man?<eos> I mean, in the photo, did it look like she was there against her will?<eos> She was making a kissy face and giving a thumbs up.<eos> Consensual or not, if they're having sex, it's statutory rape.<eos> That's something someone might kill to cover up.<eos> We need to see what else is on Winslow's phone.<eos> I'll to try to find a judge who'll give us a warrant.<eos> You okay, buddy?<eos> I know this must all be pretty confusing for you.
Even if you don't see it. I do.<eos> The best thing you can do for yourself and for Peyton is be honest.<eos> Be direct.<eos> And be Ravi.<eos> Because Ravi is a pretty cool guy.<eos> Thanks, dad brain.<eos> You find anything on those old Chuck Burd shows?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Well, get back to work.<eos> There's a crisp five dollar bill in it for you if you do. Oh!
Winslow says she didn't tell him.<eos> Winslow, our technology expert found an app on your phone called tinker spy. - I don't know what that is.<eos> - It's an app marketed to parents.<eos> It's installed secretly on their kid's phones to keep tabs on them.<eos> It works on a monthly subscription.<eos> Anything you do on your phone, all calls, all texts, they get recorded and passed along to the subscriber.<eos> Ken was spying on me?<eos> There is a phone number associated with the credit card used for the tinker spy subscription.<eos> My colleague is calling it now.<eos> You?
- I'm not.<eos> Did you know the equatorial diameter of the Earth is 12,756 kilometers?<eos> Paul?<eos> No.<eos> We're out.<eos> This is right now.<eos> - Listen to me, David.<eos> - I didn't...<eos> Yes.<eos> This was you.
We kept their heads instead.<eos> We lived in the country.<eos> Read mostly picture books.<eos> That sounds nice.<eos> Trees and meadows.<eos> No crowds.<eos> Do you ever...<eos> - What? - Well, it's...<eos> Sometimes, I feel like I have long hair.<eos> Like, from when we... when I was you.
- Stop. You think you're safe here?<eos> With these clowns?<eos> They're helping me.<eos> Oh, like the hospital helped you?<eos> No. No. I'm not sick.<eos> I have abilities.<eos> - Huh. - They're showing me in my past.<eos> I have power.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> That's good. I'm happy for you.

I'm happy for you.<eos> Meanwhile, who knows how many commandos are gangbanging your sister right in the corn hole, but you're right... that's good.<eos> Work on you, man.
Interesting.<eos> Memories within memories.<eos> Why say that?<eos> Did you...<eos> Uh, guys, I think something's coming.<eos> Ooh. Did you see that?<eos> See what?<eos> There was a flash, and I saw David.<eos> I don't think that we should be here.<eos> Behind you!
Do you have a place that you like to hide?<eos> A place where no one can find you?<eos> In here?<eos> David, come here!<eos> Wait.<eos> Oh! David, it's okay.<eos> It's just me.<eos> David, you need to wake up.<eos> I can't help us anymore.<eos> It has to be you.
Previously on "The 100"...<eos> The death wave will be here in 10 days.<eos> What I found was a fallout shelter, built to sustain thousands. Salvation lies within.<eos> The radiation doesn't care if you're Trikru or Azgeda.<eos> Azgeda will never see the inside.<eos> What if we share it?<eos> I can live with that.<eos> When the time comes to close the door, Azgeda will see that it's done.<eos> I'll take you home.
Mine, maybe.<eos> Not my people's.<eos> That was before you surrounded the temple.<eos> Look, now no one can get in to survive unless you allow it.<eos> Indra will have no choice but to talk.<eos> Fine.<eos> We'll talk.<eos> But I'm holding your people. My chancellor needs to be at that meeting, roan.<eos> Your chancellor's lucky he still has his head.<eos> Besides, if anyone can convince mortal enemies to move in together, it's you.
When this party started, that wasn't true.<eos> Make no mistake...<eos> You choose to stay and you're choosing death.<eos> If that's your decision, I'm with you all the way.<eos> If not, there's the door.<eos> No one here will judge you if you leave.<eos> Ok, then.<eos> I guess we have nothing to lose.<eos> You can't ignore me forever, raven.<eos> I mean, I guess you could try, but we're the same, you and I, and I know the truth.
Miserable?<eos> In pain?<eos> Or up there?<eos> Free?<eos> Floating?<eos> I've run all the simulations.<eos> There's not enough fuel to get back.<eos> Who said anything about getting back?<eos> Your friends are taken care of.<eos> They don't need you to keep them alive in the bunker.
Is that clear?<eos> No. Ok, just... Just wait.<eos> Jasper, people will get hurt.<eos> I know you care about that.<eos> If you don't want anyone to get hurt, don't open the door.<eos> We're all set.<eos> We should clear the hall.<eos> Mr. Jordan, I will not leave children here to die.<eos> You sent them down to die.<eos> The difference now is that they have a choice. And so do you.
Whatever the hell you want.<eos> Monty?<eos> Everyone left.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I love you, Harper.<eos> Change your mind?<eos> No.<eos> I'm here in case you guys change yours.<eos> Always the optimist.<eos> I love that about you.
We did the right thing, Clarke.<eos> Yesterday, we were right.<eos> Today, we have to live with being wrong.<eos> We're back on the Ark.<eos> Killing our own people so that... so that we can live.<eos> Locking them up.<eos> Bellamy's sister is out there.<eos> He would do anything to open that door.<eos> Do you think that's a risk we should take?<eos> No, but unlike you, I hate myself for it.
Good.<eos> In the meantime,<eos> Bellamy has a lot of friends in the guard.<eos> We need to put someone on his door that wants to survive more than be liked.<eos> I think I know someone like that.<eos> They're just gonna keep him locked up for 5 years?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Clarke, this is his sister we're talking about.<eos> I think we both know he's never just gonna let that go.<eos> Look, all I need to know from you is...
You're wrong.<eos> Look, this is only gonna be for a few days.<eos> She'll be dead in a few days!<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Let me out!<eos> Becca, where is he?<eos> Are you ok?<eos> She is not as smart as she thinks.<eos> Sinclair. It was you.
This one shows the air in hangar bay.<eos> It'll spike with the death wave.<eos> But everyone here will be dead by then anyway.<eos> It's already happening, Harper.<eos> You're getting sick.<eos> If you come with me tonight, you'll get better.<eos> The bunker is safe.<eos> Then you should go there.<eos> Now while you still can.<eos> I'm not leaving without you.
You're getting sick.<eos> If you come with me tonight, you'll get better.<eos> The bunker is safe.<eos> Then you should go there.<eos> Now while you still can.<eos> I'm not leaving without you.<eos> Well, I'm staying.<eos> It's my choice.<eos> But I don't want to watch you die.<eos> You and Jasper are my family.
Wonkru, Indra.<eos> I will not banish an entire clan because of one person's sins.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Only for you to honor your king by joining me.<eos> If you do, when Bellamy opens that door, my decision will stand.<eos> Azgeda will survive Praimfaya.<eos> Your plan is to wait?<eos> To hope Bellamy comes to your rescue?<eos> Yes.<eos> Knowing how he feels about you...
I didn't do this to my wrists for fun.<eos> You want me to help you open the door.<eos> Abby, I saw your face when you heard my sister's voice on the radio.<eos> Kane's out there.<eos> You don't think I know that?<eos> Do better today than we did yesterday.<eos> That's what he told me.<eos> That's how we deserve to survive.<eos> John?<eos> I need you.
We know that if that door stays shut, the human race survives.<eos> Please.<eos> You're gonna have to make it a kill shot.<eos> It's the only way you're gonna stop me.<eos> Oh, I knew you'd come through.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> Octavia, they're here.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Everyone except you.
I know.<eos> It's ok.<eos> Here's the takeaway.<eos> You don't have to be willing to die to really live.<eos> I am.<eos> If this works, you'll wake up, and we'll both be gone.<eos> You're always with me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You did this, Reyes, not me, not her.<eos> It was in you all along.
Don't do this to me.<eos> Please.<eos> Say you love me or you'll regret it, Monty.<eos> This is unsanitary.<eos> Open your mouth.<eos> I'm just trying to help you!<eos> This isn't a joke.<eos> This is real, you idiot.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> This is you.
Go!<eos> Get on to your bunks!<eos> Hey! What the hell's going on?<eos> Move!<eos> To the rotunda.<eos> Where's my son?<eos> Ethan! Have you seen my boy?<eos> Stop pushing.<eos> Stop pushing.<eos> Skaikru, you move!
What's happening?<eos> That's everyone.<eos> Close the door.<eos> Three out of four of these people are going to die tonight.<eos> You still think you made the right choice?<eos> Just hang in there.<eos> We're sending a team to get you today.<eos> You're sure about this?<eos> Yes.<eos> We need you and not just for the hundreds of things we know you can fix, but for the thousands that we haven't even thought of yet.
Until 20 minutes ago, our people believed they were safe.<eos> They let down their guard.<eos> They picked their bunks.<eos> They unpacked their bags.<eos> They imagined their futures.<eos> You try to rip that from them now, and, believe me, they will fight.<eos> No one's saying it's gonna be easy, but we need to make the people listen to reason.<eos> Someone still needs to get Raven.<eos> I'd like to volunteer.<eos> And I'll join you.
Is that it?<eos> And then we threaten to destroy the crops unless they make room for our people.<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> Once we have the food, we have the power.<eos> We call the shots.<eos> We found the Skaikru armory.<eos> They are our guns now.<eos> We can't wait any longer.<eos> Your orders?<eos> I'll be right beside you.
Stop. Just listen to me, I'm begging you.<eos> You found this place when nobody else believed you.<eos> You... you saved 1,100 Grounders.<eos> You saved humanity, but if you don't stop now,<eos> you're taking every bit of that salvation back.<eos> This is your moment.<eos> Fight! Fight! Fight!<eos> Fight! Fight! Fight!<eos> Fight! Fight! Fight!<eos> Your people need you.
Previously on "The 100"...<eos> Skaikru will not take the bunker alone.<eos> We'll share it.<eos> Someone still needs to get Raven.<eos> - I'd like to volunteer.<eos> - And I'll join you.
You're not that little girl anymore.<eos> What is it, O.?<eos> I'm not sure I'm up for this, Bell.<eos> They look at me like I know what I'm doing just because I won a fight.<eos> They look at you like that because you saved them.<eos> But it won't last.<eos> - Now you have to lead.<eos> - How?<eos> I'm not a leader.<eos> It should be you or Clarke or...
Yeah. They were both EMP'd.<eos> And Abby will be fine, too.<eos> Raven told her how to stop it.<eos> That's not what I'm talking about.<eos> If anything happens to me...<eos> Nothing is happening to you.<eos> Now, come on.<eos> Let's run these water numbers again.<eos> Please, Bellamy, I need you to hear this.<eos> We've been through a lot together, you and I.
- Raven... - It's over, Clarke.<eos> You know, maybe if I still had A.L.I.E.'s code eating away my brain, I could figure it out.<eos> I'm not smart enough myself.<eos> Hey, Raven... you can do this.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> How many times have you saved our asses before you ever even heard of A.L.I.E.?<eos> Oh, too many to count.<eos> You're damn right.<eos> We don't need A.L.I.E. on the Ark.<eos> We need you.
You can be impressed with me later.<eos> We got to go.<eos> Aligning the dish is a one-person job.<eos> Clarke can handle it.<eos> Harper will help me with the generator.<eos> Go.<eos> Clarke, if this is one of those moments<eos> - where you tell me to use my head...<eos> - No. I was just gonna say, hurry.<eos> You, too.
10 minutes.<eos> I got this.<eos> Any last advice?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Run fast.<eos> Emori!<eos> Echo!<eos> Little help here?<eos> Don't drop it.<eos> You and Emori load the generator.
Get out, Bellamy.<eos> Go back to the sky where you belong.<eos> I belong nowhere.<eos> You do that, you die a coward.<eos> I betrayed you.<eos> Why are you trying to save me?<eos> Because, Echo, I'm afraid, too.<eos> We are about to head to space, where we will be tested every minute of every day for the next 5 years.<eos> I'm not gonna lie to you.<eos> maybe I never will... but you are strong.

Mossad carried out a black op on American soil.<eos> If the FBI finds out about it, it will be an international incident.<eos> - Where's the system?<eos> - It's here.<eos> Safe.<eos> For now.<eos> Reddington says the NMB sent Farook with a team to get it back.<eos> You need to take the system and go.<eos> You all need to leave the country.<eos> What about you?
- What the hell is he doing here?<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> You're--<eos> Just hoping the jackals and mongers will give you the time and space you need to settle in before they start feasting at your doorstep.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> Robert, I know your dance card is full, but we have an appointment that I must insist you keep.<eos> The mustache is an interesting choice, sort of a Grover Cleveland look, I suppose.<eos> Marlin, call security.<eos> No, just... give us a moment.<eos> You and I are even.
You and I are even.<eos> - Not quite.<eos> - The hell we're not.<eos> I halted my presidential campaign and launched a Senate hearing into Alexander Kirk's links to terrorism.<eos> And in exchange, you received a generous donation and an appreciable bump in the polls, and now look what's happened.<eos> Robert, the man you're replacing as the leader of the free world has a legacy he'll want you to help burnish by keeping certain people and policies in place.<eos> He'll want favors.<eos> To get them, this is one of the things he'll have to do for you.<eos> This is over.<eos> You and I are done.

You're not supposed to fat-shame, you're not supposed to slut-shame.<eos> They're, like, shaming shaming.<eos> People aren't supposed to walk around with any shame.<eos> It's a legitimate human emotion, but you're not supposed to feel it at all.<eos> You're supposed to just walk around like a dictator.<eos> You're not gonna feel any shame? You've never felt shame?<eos> You never had such a bad fucking night, the next morning, you woke up, you couldn't even look in the mirror?<eos> When you brush your teeth, you looked up.<eos> You're like, "Oh, you fucking piece of shit.<eos> Even for you, that was bad.
No, it's ridiculous.<eos> I know nobody wants to be fat, so I'm not shitting on anyone.<eos> But don't fucking come at me like it's my problem, and I need to fucking rewire myself. No.<eos> You're overweight, okay?<eos> There's plenty of things that can help you out.<eos> Everybody's got something to deal with.<eos> I'm a fucking lunatic with my temper.<eos> This is something I have to deal with.<eos> I do. You know?<eos> You, you can't fucking stop eating pork chops.
Honestly, people, I'm a bald red-headed male.<eos> You don't think there's a glass ceiling on the kinds of parts I can get in Hollywood?<eos> Really?<eos> Do you think I'm ever gonna be the lead in a romantic comedy?<eos> That ain't happening, even if I'm booking the movie.<eos> I want to make the money back.<eos> That's the thing, it's show business.<eos> There's $1 million on this film, okay?<eos> We're trying to make fucking money.<eos> You just want to show up with fucking crumbs on the side of your face?
Whatever the fuck you want!<eos> Get it out of here... before it goes bad!"<eos> No, it's fucked up.<eos> They somehow convinced them that... You know?<eos> "McDonald's is the reason why I'm out of shape."<eos> "I would have got a salad, but you didn't have the option, so I was like,<eos> "Well, I guess I gotta get 52 Big Macs."<eos> "Thanks a lot, McDonald's!"<eos> It's like, "Dude, you're an adult.<eos> It's not their job to babysit you.

A bunch of creepy dudes all sitting around some giant table.<eos> Right? They probably talk about it then.<eos> Just sitting down after, like...<eos> "I trust everyone had their fun?"<eos> "Let's get down to the task at hand.<eos> There are over 7.5 billion people on the planet.<eos> We're running out of fresh water.<eos> There won't be enough chicken... to feed the others.<eos> Does anyone here have any suggestions... on how to eliminate the pressures of the undesirables?"<eos> "Ah, yes, you.
"You're gonna kill yourself."<eos> I just sat up, like...<eos> I'm like, "No, I'm not!<eos> No, I am not!"<eos> My wife wakes up. "What's the matter?" "I just had the most scary dream I've ever had in my life!<eos> It was horrible!"<eos> She's like, "Was I in it?"<eos> "No, you self-centered jackass!<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> Not everything is about you, sweetheart.
Calm down.<eos> You sent one text.<eos> No organs, no surgery, right?<eos> Didn't hear anything else after that, so I figured I'd have a drink.<eos> Oh. Battery died.<eos> Well, that's not very helpful, now, is it?<eos> - You're drunk.<eos> - You're pissed.<eos> Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, I am.<eos> We lost the donor, Caroline's repeat scans show more extensive esophageal invasion, her parents are a wreck, and... and you're... you're here getting drunk?

We should get to work.<eos> Sure.<eos> I hate this.<eos> I don't see how we could do anything but the laryngectomy, but I hate the laryngectomy.<eos> Seems like she'd have had a better shot if you'd taken her to Grey Sloan.<eos> She's not stable enough to move.<eos> You know that.<eos> No, not now.<eos> I'm just saying, I don't know why we had to come all the way out here.<eos> Do you?
Then we still would not have had enough time for the flap.<eos> I mean, come on.<eos> You made your point.<eos> I was drunk, April.<eos> I get it.<eos> - I don't need you to monitor everything...<eos> - I'm not!<eos> I am just trying to come up with a fix for our patient, regardless of the fact that you don't even want me here.<eos> And yet you're still here.<eos> 'Cause you and my mother are such good friends that she chose you instead of asking me who I want.

Come inside. Oh, Jackson.<eos> I'm sorry, it's just, my brain is going a little... you know?<eos> You want to sit?<eos> Of course not.<eos> You've been sitting.<eos> Why didn't you just...<eos> I mean, I don't blame you, but...<eos> I'm sorry, I do not know what to say here.<eos> Are you here for work, too, at the hospital?<eos> You and your friend, uh, April, was it?
No, what I mean is, uh...<eos> What you do, your family.<eos> Are you married?<eos> Kids?<eos> I guess what I'm asking is, are you happy?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> No.<eos> Not "of course."<eos> I'm happy.<eos> Are you?
Yeah, of course.<eos> No.<eos> Not "of course."<eos> I'm happy.<eos> Are you?<eos> Honestly, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> But for me, the whole Avery thing...<eos> I just couldn't do it.<eos> If it works for you, great.
You are a good father.<eos> You took us both in.<eos> You took care of her when I couldn't.<eos> And you haven't stopped taking care of either of us since.<eos> Even with everything that's happened between us... you never bailed.<eos> And he couldn't do that.<eos> You came here to tell him something.<eos> Don't leave till you do.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> Sit, sit. I got something for you.
Jackson.<eos> That is wonderful.<eos> I'm a grandfather.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> My mom's a wonderful grandmother, and... and you seem like a decent guy.<eos> But you're not a grandfather.<eos> You're not my father.<eos> And I figure, when you have a kid, you're making a promise.<eos> And I don't break my promises.<eos> That's the real difference between you and me.
Previously on "Blindspot"...<eos> She can't remember who she is, where she came from, nothing before she crawled out of that bag in Times Square.<eos> Sandstorm is responsible for over a dozen domestic terror attacks in total.<eos> They're gonna blow up the power grid.<eos> Get out!<eos> It's a trap!<eos> No!<eos> Got the chance to start over again.<eos> And now you will, too.
How do you feel?<eos> All right, I'm...<eos> I'm good.<eos> I'm good money.<eos> Hey, I think that's the morphine talking.<eos> Are you going through a dry spell?<eos> shut up.<eos> So you're scheming on guys passed out in the hospital?<eos> Something's wrong, Tasha.<eos> I was worried about you.
She made lives better all over the world.<eos> She helped build the hospital that she died in.<eos> And it only stood for one month before an unsanctioned American bombing turned it to ash.<eos> The government that murdered her is the same government you work for.<eos> You are on the wrong side.<eos> I am?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Your side... sounds really cool.<eos> So you should just go ahead and untie me... because I'm converted.<eos> If I were you...
Sorry, what?<eos> Dessert?<eos> Maybe a slice of pie?<eos> Sir, are you all right?<eos> Take the girl, get out of here.<eos> Go.<eos> Hey there, Roman.<eos> Your sister sent me to pick you up.<eos> You know my sister?<eos> She's worried about you.
Roman, I understand that you're angry.<eos> But I need your help.<eos> A friend of mine is missing, and you may know where she is.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Everything is empty.<eos> And I know exactly what that feels like.<eos> When I was brought to the FBI, I couldn't remember who I was or what I'd done.<eos> I was empty.<eos> And these people helped me feel full again.<eos> They took care of you?

Let's move.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> You won't feel anything, I promise.<eos> Please... please, don't.<eos> I'll begin with a saline drip to ensure that your IV is working properly.<eos> Next, I'll administer propofol, which will render you unconscious.<eos> I know that you don't want to do this!<eos> What I want doesn't matter.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> This isn't who you are.
Do this... and you will become everything you hate.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes... you do.<eos> Just like the people who killed your wife had a choice.<eos> Just think about her, okay?<eos> What would she want?<eos> You told me that she saved so many people's lives.<eos> Now, you can save mine.<eos> You loved her.<eos> And I know a part you loves me, too.
It... it makes sense, Tasha.<eos> We're friends.<eos> That's all.<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> I thought you might want a warm meal.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This is only temporary.<eos> I promise.<eos> I...<eos> I have something else for you.
I get it.<eos> Just kind of got invested.<eos> We almost made it.<eos> Almost.<eos> Well, listen, I'm gonna order a head CT for you.<eos> And, uh... I'll see what I can find out.<eos> Gonna order a head CT.<eos> Is Minnick starting today?<eos> I think I saw her on the O.R. floor.<eos> I know what you know.
In the other car...<eos> I hit you.<eos> What?<eos> It's all my fault.<eos> Okay, Bryan, we need to get started.<eos> Oh, no, wait, wait...<eos> Mindy, you're gonna feel a little drowsy...<eos> Mindy, I'm so sorry.<eos> I love you... so much.<eos> It was you?
I-I found someone to help me, but she's still unstable.<eos> There's too much pressure on the mediastinum.<eos> She's not oxygenating or perfusing well despite the heart-lung bypass.<eos> And she's still... hang on.<eos> Another clamp.<eos> Hang more FFP.<eos> Right angle.<eos> Dr. Robbins, this baby's tanking.<eos> I think we need to get her into the O.R.<eos> Who's with you?
You're tanking this case.<eos> Has something happened?<eos> - Has he threatened you?<eos> - Absolutely not.<eos> No, he's, uh... great.<eos> - DeLuca. - This case is a slam dunk.<eos> It's a slam freakin' dunk.<eos> I'm sorry to waste your time.<eos> So, Andrew called off the trial?<eos> Yeah. - For you? - Yeah.
What if they hate each other?<eos> Do you think she thought about that?<eos> Can I say a thing?<eos> No.<eos> All right. I better get to the ER.<eos> Wait.<eos> Say a thing.<eos> It'll be okay.<eos> Whatever happens, you're their kid.<eos> Oh. It's you.

Webber was the program since I've been here.<eos> Really, Karev?<eos> The second I give you your job back?<eos> Look, since you've been here.<eos> Get out of my office before I change my mind.<eos> Go!<eos> Just promise me you won't turn her into a fish-lipped monster with an immobile forehead.<eos> That's not something I do.<eos> I'm just reminding you that you swore a sacred oath as a physician to give sound medical counsel to women who are already beautiful.<eos> To you.

- Ew, Mom! - Go.<eos> I'll text you when I'm done.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, firstly, I do agree with your daughter.<eos> You look terrific.<eos> But that doesn't mean there aren't some things that you might like to change.<eos> So, I'd like to start with just a brief conversation so that I can get a better sense of...<eos> I always taught my daughter, if she wanted to know something, don't ask the Internet.<eos> Find the smartest person in the room.<eos> And if they're not smarter than you, find another room.
I saw you almost every day.<eos> I worked for your friends every day.<eos> I knew what happened that night.<eos> I knew what you were thinking.<eos> I knew why you hit me.<eos> And if you would have just treated me like a human being, if you would have just talked to me, maybe we could have avoided all this.<eos> I didn't think you'd listen.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm a pretty good guy!<eos> Why'd you do it?<eos> - I don't have to explain myself to you.
She makes some good lasagna, though.<eos> Are you seeing this?<eos> Bailey hired an interim chief of General?<eos> Bailey replaced you?<eos> With who?<eos> Kepner?<eos> Amelia?<eos> Every day you don't open the door, it gets a little easier to stay inside.<eos> I can't pull you out anymore.<eos> No one can open this door but you.
No, baby, no.<eos> I told Bailey there was a problem.<eos> - You told her there was a problem.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You see a problem in our marriage, will I hear about it, or will some consultant come and kick me out of our bedroom?<eos> Stop.<eos> You know me better than that.<eos> No, Catherine, right now, I don't.<eos> I really don't.<eos> Take O.R. 4 and make sure you do the post-op debriefing with the resident right away.
It's not special treatment, and don't call her that.<eos> Minnick told me she drew names from a hat.<eos> See?<eos> Whatever...<eos> Mr. Bailey.<eos> She's really gonna let you do a whole surgery with no help?<eos> No hand-holding, no training wheels, no safety belts, no gutter bumpers.<eos> Phase two, baby!<eos> Shut up, baby.<eos> Yeah, what happened to you?
- Maggie!<eos> - I thought you were with us.<eos> I thought you were with Richard.<eos> And then you go and do this?<eos> I took a job!<eos> It was an opportunity!<eos> It's aiding the enemy!<eos> I'm not saying I agree with what Bailey did...<eos> But you are saying that it's not a deal-breaker!<eos> Not for you.
Did she?<eos> Or was that my mom again?<eos> Telling Bailey that she should pick you.<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> Uh, 'cause it's probably true.<eos> It's not even your fault.<eos> It's her.<eos> It's what she does.<eos> No.<eos> No, it's you.
Uh, 'cause it's probably true.<eos> It's not even your fault.<eos> It's her.<eos> It's what she does.<eos> No.<eos> No, it's you.<eos> Because you refuse to believe that I got this because I earned it.<eos> That's... Because I'm good.<eos> That's not...<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
Never a little boy.<eos> I took that boy from his parents.<eos> And now I have to tell them.<eos> And I don't know how.<eos> How do you do it?<eos> How do you stop feeling like this?<eos> You don't.<eos> You... You just learn how to...<eos> You learn how to feel this way a little faster.<eos> You let it hurt, and then you... you put it behind you so that you can face forward to the... the next kid who needs you.
It might be your worst, but... it won't be your last.<eos> What was his name?<eos> Matty.<eos> Matty.<eos> Matty.<eos> What... What... What do I do next?<eos> Okay, so, if you think you're gonna lose it, then I'll jump in.<eos> I think I'll be fine.<eos> I just... I guess I'm off the hook.<eos> I have a tip for you.
At least be comfortable.<eos> Be in your pajamas.<eos> Uh, I'd just as soon stay here.<eos> Why is that?<eos> Because my roommate is a narrow-minded, short-sighted, judgmental, and insulting piece of work.<eos> Oh, and I am sorry.<eos> I should not have said that to you.<eos> He's mad you took the job.<eos> Did you...<eos> Did you put me up for this?
Oh, and I am sorry.<eos> I should not have said that to you.<eos> He's mad you took the job.<eos> Did you...<eos> Did you put me up for this?<eos> No.<eos> It was all Bailey.<eos> I thought it was smart.<eos> April, Jackson can never understand what you did.<eos> He's not like you and me.

Are we going to talk about what happened today?<eos> Can we not?<eos> Look, I... I need a break.<eos> I'm in the middle of everything<eos> - at the hospital...<eos> - You are in the middle of everything?<eos> Yes, me, Miranda.<eos> I'm a resident, you know?<eos> So I want to side with them because Minnick is great for us, but the attendings are my friends.<eos> Now they stop talking when I'm around, because I'm married to you.
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...<eos> I'm married to a guy who almost beat me to death.<eos> - You do this everywhere you go?<eos> - Do what?<eos> Turn the place against you.
So, who thinks they're ready to run lead on those?<eos> I'm not ready.<eos> That is the right answer.<eos> - It is?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Okay, great. I am not ready.<eos> Put your hand down, intern.<eos> None of you are ready, but you are ready to do as much of it as you can under the extremely close supervision of an attending with the reminder to pass it off if you need to, which means you'll be that much closer to being ready.<eos> The donor will be an O.R. 2 supervised by Dr. Webber.<eos> That'll be you, Warren, with Cross assisting.
You hear me?<eos> I have rights!<eos> Hey, why don't we sit down?<eos> Why'd you bring him here?<eos> - I'm sor...<eos> - Why would you do that? !<eos> Cynthia, do you want to sit down?<eos> - Hey, big transplant today.<eos> - Don't talk to me.<eos> - I'm mad at you. - Oh, God, did you go?
She signed up to save her son's life.<eos> At the expense of her own?<eos> She came in here perfectly healthy.<eos> If you found the stenosis a minute later, we wouldn't even be talking about this.<eos> - The kidney would already be in him.<eos> - Yeah, but it isn't, and if we don't put it in someone soon, it's gonna die an no one gets it, so who's it going to?<eos> Why are you asking me?<eos> I'm not deciding.<eos> Just answer the question.<eos> Where do you think the kidney should go?
So, people are really embracing this new method of teaching.<eos> Some say it's actually fun.<eos> Today you would have been performing a mother-to-son kidney transplant.<eos> You don't have to sell me on the method, Bailey.<eos> People like it.<eos> I get it.<eos> Good.<eos> It's not insubordination.<eos> Well, it's not cooperation.<eos> Look, I made you my Chief of General because I wanted you to be my right hand.
Never seen residents learn the way that they did today.<eos> It was inspiring.<eos> It's 2-nil in favor of the home side.<eos> And that could be the dagger for Portland.<eos> Oh, hey. I was just texting you.<eos> It's not fun.<eos> - You know, this is... it's not fun.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I don't like pretending not to like you, and I don't like listening to the awful things that people have to say about you...
And we've put you on a... some medication to calm you down.<eos> It might make you feel a little groggy.<eos> I... you can't... you... you can't feel...<eos> You can't feel the snakes in the hat.<eos> Nobody can feel the snakes.<eos> Hi, Mom.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi, sweetie.<eos> Hi, Claire-Bear.<eos> Can we sit with you?
- Please.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's this sweet little old nun, and she needs open-heart surgery but she can't have it until her brain aneurysm is clipped.<eos> It's so sad.<eos> Poor Sister Agnes.<eos> Don't "nun" me.<eos> The nun detail was a little bit much, but please.<eos> Please.<eos> Come on.<eos> I need you.
New mattresses!<eos> Hey. You okay?<eos> No.<eos> My back hurts.<eos> Oh, and there's nothing like having your dirty laundry aired for everyone to see.<eos> Oh, that bad, huh?<eos> And as long as Minnick's here, it's gonna stay bad.<eos> I don't know what to do... except give up and give in.<eos> No, no, that's not acceptable.<eos> Everyone's behind you.

- I know. - Yeah.<eos> - And...<eos> - And what?<eos> It's just embarrassing being demoted.<eos> You were not demoted.<eos> From Chief of General Surgery to Trauma Attending?<eos> - It looks like that.<eos> - April, April.<eos> A title is only as good as the person who earned it.<eos> Grey is very good, but when she wasn't here, the person they turned to was you.
I like doing that stuff...<eos> the admin work, the scheduling.<eos> Meredith doesn't even like it.<eos> You know, I want you to see the Avery Trauma Center in Chicago.<eos> They do things very differently than you do here.<eos> We should go.<eos> Ab...<eos> Absolutely. I'd love to see how they run things.<eos> No, honey.<eos> I want them to see how you run things.
I mean, are you really telling me this is good management, Mom?<eos> You think this is good for morale?<eos> Maybe if you hadn't talked the entire staff into forming a coup, you might have listened.<eos> The patient getting coagulopathic.<eos> Mayo scissors.<eos> And you know what?<eos> You have no clue about management.<eos> Oh, I almost forgot you got a new minion in the deal.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> What is it you want to learn from my mom exactly... how to get an entire hospital to turn against you in a day or...
Jackson, stop it!<eos> Just stop it!<eos> You keep saying, "I'm an Avery, I'm an Avery,"<eos> but you're not, not in the way you're trying to be.<eos> A title doesn't mean anything.<eos> It's the person who owns it.<eos> Yes, I took your father's name, but it's what I did with it.<eos> It's what I made with it.<eos> That's what matters.<eos> You?
What?<eos> Alex said you were being a jerk.<eos> Ugh. Of course.<eos> He tattled.<eos> Let me make something very clear to you.<eos> If you want to get anywhere with me, messing with Alex is not the way.<eos> Do not contradict him in front of patients.<eos> And please don't speak to him like he's an idiot.<eos> Back it up.<eos> Get... Get anywhere with you?
He tattled.<eos> Let me make something very clear to you.<eos> If you want to get anywhere with me, messing with Alex is not the way.<eos> Do not contradict him in front of patients.<eos> And please don't speak to him like he's an idiot.<eos> Back it up.<eos> Get... Get anywhere with you?<eos> - So, you admit it?<eos> - Admit what?<eos> That there's somewhere to get with you.
That's not really a good idea, Jim.<eos> He's not out of the woods yet.<eos> I'd really like him to rest so we can go back in tomorrow.<eos> Right now you guys should just get some food, get some rest yourselves.<eos> No.<eos> We aren't going anywhere.<eos> Tell you what... you guys stay here, and I'll bring us in some food.<eos> Food?<eos> You're gonna get us food?<eos> You?
Well, I put him on the list.<eos> Without... Without telling me?<eos> Without the parents' consent?<eos> Did you know about this?<eos> Well, I-if he wasn't on the list...<eos> Karev, this is a good thing, okay?<eos> All we've got to do now is have an awkward conversation with the parents, and then we save a kid's life.<eos> You're unbelievable.<eos> You know that?<eos> I can talk to the family with you.
This is why you called me all the way in here at this hour?<eos> He went behind my back.<eos> He lied to me.<eos> Hey, what's going on?<eos> We ready?<eos> Hold on.<eos> Look, I don't trust him.<eos> I don't want him in the O.R. with me.<eos> Uh, what?<eos> Dr. Karev has raised a complaint against you.
Excuse me?<eos> You're just giving in to this new way of teaching?<eos> I was teaching a capable resident, same as I always have, long before Minnick.<eos> No. No.<eos> In there, that was... that was different.<eos> Look, we can win this thing, all right?<eos> There are strings that I can pull, you know?<eos> - I have a voice.<eos> - Jackson, don't do it.<eos> It'll tear you and your mother apart.
Jim loves Dad.<eos> You're kidding, right?<eos> Pam, it was an accident.<eos> Uh, which way?<eos> How could you do that?<eos> How can you do this to somebody you care about?<eos> Jackson, you need to stop this foolishness.<eos> What?<eos> I just need to know.<eos> I need to know if business is really that much more important to you than family.
What?<eos> I just need to know.<eos> I need to know if business is really that much more important to you than family.<eos> This has nothing to do with family.<eos> Of course it has to do with family.<eos> Look, I get it, all right?<eos> Business is business.<eos> If you need to fire someone or replace them, do it.<eos> But if it's someone you love, you just...<eos> Does that mean nothing to you?

I am so happy with who you are.<eos> I am.<eos> I just wish you were, too.<eos> Saved the baby.<eos> Huh? Excuse me?<eos> The...<eos> The baby, the one that Karev and I were...<eos> Anyway, the kid's alive.<eos> Oh, well, that's great news.<eos> Okay. Now you're the one being the jerk.
Anyway, the kid's alive.<eos> Oh, well, that's great news.<eos> Okay. Now you're the one being the jerk.<eos> Well, because Alex was right about you.<eos> Oh, yes, of course, 'cause everybody's always in your ear, telling you what to think about me.<eos> - Maggie...<eos> - Nobody tells me what to think.<eos> Okay, good, 'cause I don't want their opinion, okay?<eos> I care about what you think.<eos> About you?
Oh, yes, of course, 'cause everybody's always in your ear, telling you what to think about me.<eos> - Maggie...<eos> - Nobody tells me what to think.<eos> Okay, good, 'cause I don't want their opinion, okay?<eos> I care about what you think.<eos> About you?<eos> Actually, I think a lot of things.<eos> No, no, no. No banter. No more quips.<eos> I'll tell you what I think.<eos> I think about you... a lot.

No, you don't.<eos> At least, not tonight.<eos> You weren't even supposed to be here today. Come on.<eos> You fight... and you fight, and you fight.<eos> To what end?<eos> Come home.<eos> What are we fighting against?<eos> What are we fighting for?<eos> Just get a good night's sleep.<eos> I never wanted to come between the two of you... you and Jackson.
No.<eos> Oh, stop.<eos> I'm not some puppet.<eos> I have my own brain.<eos> I have my own opinions.<eos> Working with your mom and the foundation... it's full of opportunities for me.<eos> And I get that you never wanted that, and that's fine.<eos> But she sees something in me.<eos> All right, I'm going to bed.<eos> What is going on with you?
- I had a baby.<eos> - Had?<eos> He lived for 43 minutes without a brain.<eos> And it almost killed me.<eos> - ...tell you not to come home?<eos> - I cannot keep doing this.<eos> - Doing what?<eos> I'm not...<eos> - I don't want to have a baby!<eos> I think about you a lot, and I'm telling you, I am in... if you are.
1, 2, 3.<eos> Don't be pompous.<eos> You were a surgeon. So was I.<eos> They're surgeons now.<eos> She'll need a head C.T.<eos> Still, we'd like to rule out other injuries.<eos> Oh, It's nothing.<eos> I-I just got a little lightheaded.<eos> You don't know it's nothing.<eos> I know as much as you do.
Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> Pierce asked if she could discharge the triple-A that you guys were working on if you didn't have any objections.<eos> Nope, not at all.<eos> Great.<eos> So, did you have a chance to think about it?<eos> Oh, no. I don't need to think about it.<eos> - You can discharge him.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> I mean, uh, the thing that I said about how I think about you.
Even size?<eos> We discussed everything I needed to discuss.<eos> So what did you decide, size-wise?<eos> I just want to be prepared, you know?<eos> I've been hugging the same person for the last 30 years, you know?<eos> - This is a big...<eos> - Maggie.<eos> - This is a big renovation.<eos> - Maggie.<eos> I-I don't want to discuss this with you.
- Wilson, please.<eos> - Jackson!<eos> What the hell?<eos> Why am I locked out of my mother's file?<eos> I'm a doctor.<eos> Yes, well, she requested privacy.<eos> I'm her daughter.<eos> She can't handle the fact that I might have an opinion about her boob job.<eos> She's anxious because she's going into surgery.<eos> Now you're telling me how my mom feels, Jackson?
I know what I want.<eos> And at some point... you need to figure that out, too.<eos> Just pull it together.<eos> So, you weren't into the idea of her being a surgeon at first?<eos> - I was.<eos> - Oh, he wasn't!<eos> I was halfway through my residency, and Lewis said to me,<eos> "Elsie, this surgeon business is not making you any friends.<eos> You need to think of something else to do."<eos> I was trying to take care of you!
That's unprofessional, disappointing.<eos> You know what?<eos> You just feel guilty.<eos> You know that you did wrong, and you're just trying to make yourself feel better.<eos> Whatever helps you sleep at night.<eos> Lewis, let her talk.<eos> I've heard all I need, Els.<eos> A successful surgery would definitely buy you more time.<eos> But as you know, the amount of shift, combined with your age and aspirin usage are bad prognostic signs.<eos> Surgery holds higher risk for you, much higher.
Because I'm not joking.<eos> This isn't funny to me.<eos> You know, you keep pushing me, but you're not giving me anything to go on.<eos> We have been going around and around with this for months.<eos> I feel like I don't know you.<eos> And everybody that I know that knows you... they don't like you.<eos> And you just keep making jokes like somehow that doesn't matter to me.<eos> That's not true.<eos> This isn't up to me to make a choice.<eos> It's up to you to give me a reason.
When does it end, though?<eos> It doesn't solve anything, for him to walk around, scowling at me.<eos> When does the cold shoulder stop?<eos> It will.<eos> He'll come around.<eos> Oh, uh, Shepherd's decompressing the hematoma.<eos> Fingers crossed.<eos> 60 damn years.<eos> Right?<eos> You have it in you?
And what am I going to be like, Dr. Warren?<eos> Bossy.<eos> You'll be retired and jonesing for the days when you ran a whole hospital, bossing me around, and Tuck and Tuck's poor wife.<eos> Oh, Lord help that woman.<eos> Oh, like you're gonna be some walk in the park.<eos> Me?<eos> Gonna be distinguished with a little touch of gray.<eos> And one of those guys that tells the same stories over and over and exaggerates it every time.<eos> "And then I sliced a woman open on the kitchen table during a rainstorm."<eos> You have it in you?
- You told me...<eos> - Okay, why do you even want a baby?<eos> Have you asked yourself that?<eos> - What?<eos> Why do I want a baby?<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> What do you need that you don't have that you think a baby is going to bring you?<eos> - I want a family.<eos> - You have one!<eos> You and me... That makes one.
I tried to come up with one.<eos> So then I thought, "Well, why do I like her?"<eos> And I don't know.<eos> From the first time I saw you, you were at the O.R. board.<eos> You were talking with Pierce, and she said something that made you laugh, and... I couldn't move.<eos> And then I had to wait for you to write your name on the board because... I just needed to know who you were.<eos> I don't have a good reason for you to like me.<eos> I didn't even try to like you.<eos> I didn't want to.<eos> And I certainly don't want to have to think about you all the time, trying to come in early, see your name on the board, come up with that one thing that's gonna make you smile so your eyes do that thing they do.
You were 2?<eos> 2 years old.<eos> And when I say she was reading, it was reading.<eos> Maggie was not sounding out words or anything.<eos> And you didn't teach her?<eos> Oh, nobody could teach her.<eos> My baby was a genius.<eos> That brain of hers...<eos> Okay. That's... Thanks, Mom.<eos> I have you to thank for that, I guess.
I love it!<eos> There you go.<eos> It's okay, Mom.<eos> - I just heard... an esophageal tear?<eos> Hopefully, it's contained and I don't have to open her chest.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I should do the EGD.<eos> You're too close.<eos> Go take care of Maggie.<eos> Let me do this for you.
He specializes in radioactive...<eos> Maggie...<eos> Don't you dare quit on me now.<eos> Y-You can't.<eos> You can't quit on me.<eos> We can beat this.<eos> You have to fight.<eos> I'll help you.<eos> Sweetie...<eos> Sit down and let me talk to you.
Get those to the lab for me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You all right?<eos> No.<eos> Do you want to sit down?<eos> No.<eos> I just wish my dad was here.<eos> Maggie?<eos> Meredith doesn't get it.<eos> She's just worried about you.
You need to shake it up a little.<eos> Be a little lazy or a little slutty.<eos> Make a mistake.<eos> I have a job.<eos> Well, you're never gonna look back and say,<eos> "I wish I'd been more uptight."<eos> Okay, Mom, you have to be still, or else I can't finish this.<eos> And stop always saying what everyone wants to hear.<eos> Tell someone off.<eos> It's good for 'em and better for you.
Want me to keep going?<eos> I brought my engagement ring to Seattle.<eos> It's at the house in my jewelry bag, and I want you to have it.<eos> - Mom. - Your father gave it to me.<eos> He'd want you to have it, too.<eos> So, please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I want you to fall in love.<eos> And it has to be somebody who's worthy.<eos> Find a decent man who loves you just a little more than you love him.
- What do you have to bring her up for?<eos> What does she have to do with this?<eos> You know, you are just like her.<eos> You can't stand to see me happy, so you have to destroy it.<eos> What are you trying to say, Dennis?<eos> That your mom and I are perfect for each other?<eos> Don't even.<eos> Hey, did you say anything about this to George?<eos> I did. He told me to deep-dick her.<eos> Oh, you know what, if I were you I wouldn't--
- Alex.<eos> - Alex. Cool. Nice to meet you.<eos> - We gotta go.<eos> - I do?<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> You have to do what I say. Remember?<eos> He had a big slip recently, so he needs to be kept on a short leash.<eos> Dennis is a rookie sponsor.<eos> So I'm just breaking him in.<eos> Oh, you're the friend.
I'm sure that's what attracted you.<eos> I wonder, uh... I wonder what attracted you.<eos> Open minds. Artists.<eos> Their willingness to accept new ideas.<eos> Or critical thinking would ruin what you're trying to do.<eos> I'm gonna go get my shoes before they walk away again.<eos> That's great.<eos> Yeah. I thought about doing something like this.<eos> What stopped you?<eos> I'm probably not as qualified as you are.
Or critical thinking would ruin what you're trying to do.<eos> I'm gonna go get my shoes before they walk away again.<eos> That's great.<eos> Yeah. I thought about doing something like this.<eos> What stopped you?<eos> I'm probably not as qualified as you are.<eos> You don't need a masters in clinical psychology from Yale to help people.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> A clinical psychology professor I had at Harvard.<eos> Look, man. I don't wanna tangle with you.
Jesus, George!<eos> What business you got on this side of town?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just, uh...<eos> Don't lie to me, Dennis.<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> You got some deep-dick business over here, am I right?<eos> I know that smile.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah. - Look at you.
No, the urgency is we have four hours to stop a cyber terrorism attack on our power grid.<eos> Which Lucca Quinn has nothing to do with.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> - What?<eos> What's not true?<eos> We're charging Lucca Quinn as a co-conspirator in cyber terrorism.<eos> - What's up?<eos> - We have to talk.<eos> Sure.<eos> You start.
Your Honor.<eos> One second.<eos> They can't beat me, so they're squeezing me out.<eos> All right, look, you start with the rebuttal witness.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Of course.<eos> - Good.<eos> You get angry and you focus.
And-and this is just an amateurish attempt to try and undermine some damaging testimony.<eos> What-what I find offensive is that you think the judge could be so easily manipulated.<eos> She's right, Mr. Dincon.<eos> Go sit down.<eos> Your motion is sustained, miss.<eos> Thank you, Your Honor.<eos> Thank you, Maia.<eos> I didn't want to push it, but I really wanted to see you.<eos> You seem emotional.<eos> And you seem happy.
Let's go.<eos> So you're a hero.<eos> I saw it.<eos> The video.<eos> Okay. It's... let's not.<eos> What? I was talking to you like you were eight years old and you're...<eos> - you're Sully or something.<eos> - Diane, please.<eos> I don't like it when people... make a big deal.<eos> I represent unscrupulous people, and you... you save children.
Back to normal? Uh...<eos> How exactly do you feel everything's "back to normal"?<eos> Well, Scorpion is back to the original roster, and we have a-a case to handle, and Tim leaving, as he told me, was his decision.<eos> So, I calculated that you wouldn't be angry at me...<eos> My calculations were off, weren't they?<eos> Just a bit.<eos> But Tim told me he wanted to go.<eos> Tim said what he had to say because of an uncomfortable situation you created.<eos> You effectively forced him out.<eos> So, with respect to things between you and me, things are definitely not back to normal.
Check. Energy output is a-above normal.<eos> Hmm. Well, that's because the temperature's running hot.<eos> Actually, very hot.<eos> Uh, Happy? Come check this out.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Hey, there's a bigger draw on that solar panel than expected.<eos> It's 'cause the turbine's running hot.<eos> What's up?<eos> Turbine's hot.<eos> So are you, by the way.
Rubber boot plus zip ties equals rubber hose.<eos> Nice. Nice.<eos> Oh, ah, damn it.<eos> Why did science have to make water so heavy?<eos> How's that hose coming?<eos> It's strong but I'm not sure if it's strong enough!<eos> These boots were made for walking, not pumping.<eos> Wow, a joke from Happy in a tense situation.<eos> You must be really scared.<eos> You're not?
Cabe dies.<eos> Not gonna happen.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on. That's my girl.<eos> And we're back!<eos> Happy's evaporation vacuum machine is sucking as much air as it sucked before, but in this case, sucking is a really good thing.<eos> Sly, all this is for naught if you can't get that venom.<eos> I have a plan.<eos> I'm going to use sensory jujitsu to lure this reptile out of his nook, and then nab it.<eos> I'm gonna use real jujitsu on you if you don't get that rattler!
Understood.<eos> I mean, someone has to think about it.<eos> I'm sorry, did you mean something by that?<eos> We all had a chance to say good-bye to Cabe in case we never see him again.<eos> A moment to tell him what he means to us.<eos> You told him it's been a pleasure working with him.<eos> Any idea how messed up that is?<eos> We were pressed for time.<eos> Please, Walter!<eos> I've been working so hard with you for 2½ years now.
You ready for the main event?<eos> Don't mind me.<eos> I'm just a fat kangaroo rat who's lost in the desert.<eos> Sure hope a big ol' snake doesn't come up and eat me for lunch.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I'm full of iron and proteins. Num-num.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> You should be jumping at the chance to gobble up this little fella.<eos> The only reason you wouldn't feed would be because you're pregnant.<eos> But in that case, there should be a daddy snake down here with you.
It's just like putting your hand inside of a pumpkin, but instead of a pumpkin, your hand's inside Cabe's body cavity. Oh, God.<eos> Slide your fingers down a half inch.<eos> Okay, you're right on the cut.<eos> Spread the glue all over.<eos> Don't be stingy.<eos> It feels like cold spaghetti.<eos> Good news, you're done.<eos> Remove your paw from the federal agent.<eos> Okay. Whoa. I'd fist bump you, but our hands are covered in guts.<eos> Huh? I'm really proud of you.
Walter, are you okay?<eos> Of course I am.<eos> I can't decipher you.<eos> Just when I'm sure you're an android, you're not.<eos> I know you get frustrated when I take steps backward, but I don't mean to do it; I just do.<eos> There are parts of my brain that work so much worse than others.<eos> I know.<eos> You're still mad with me about Tim, aren't you?<eos> I am.<eos> I have every right to be, but right now it's not about you or me or Tim.
Well, the Norteguayans must let the dogs roam around the perimeter freely.<eos> Veronica and Paige never saw them.<eos> And the barking isn't a problem?<eos> Noise from the printing press will cover it.<eos> Besides, if they knew we'd have escaped, we would have heard gunshots already.<eos> Well, we can't just stay in a tree forever.<eos> What we need is something to knock the dogs off of our scent.<eos> What about cayenne pepper?<eos> Should be more than enough.<eos> Rub it on the tree. You know, it's this kind of ingenuity that makes you such a valuable team member.
I got us more than time.<eos> Luiz's card key to all the rooms in the compound.<eos> They're not leaving.<eos> Then we make it unpleasant for them to stay.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm making a dog whistle.<eos> Actually, we're making the dog whistle.<eos> I know all of us have our own roles and I shouldn't minimize each other's contributions.<eos> Just shut up and tell us what we need to do.<eos> Okay, get some of the tree sap from behind you and put it on your fingers and then send it my way.
I-I answered everything honestly.<eos> In politics, honesty'll get you crushed.<eos> Throughout American history, we, the people, have had candidates known for strength, integrity... courage... and then there's this guy.<eos> Can Sylvester Dodd really help West Altadenia?<eos> Only if you believe in magic spells.<eos> Vote Patel for alderman.<eos> They edited this to make me look ridiculous.<eos> Yeah, it was the editing.<eos> Politics is a bar-room brawl.<eos> I wouldn't manage you if I didn't believe in you, kid.
Because the loyalty card clearly states,<eos> "One punch per purchase." I purchased two Cello Shell-Os.<eos> One for me, one for Ralph.<eos> Two purchases, two punches.<eos> One could argue that you made one purchase that included two items.<eos> Yes, such a stupid argument could be made, and it was, by the clerk, and things got... heated.<eos> And you got the extra punch?<eos> Not the one I was looking for.<eos> Morning.<eos> Apparently not for you.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I fell asleep for a second there.<eos> Please, honey.<eos> One last con for Mommy.<eos> Saddle up, everyone.<eos> Time to leave for Colton.<eos> What's in Colton?<eos> Besides cows.<eos> U.S. Army Corps of Engineers hired us to help some sandhog workers locate a leak in a municipal waterline.<eos> You can't go.<eos> I need you.
Oh, we'll give him all the room he needs.<eos> We can handle it from here.<eos> Walter has no idea how insensitive he sounds.<eos> This is great.<eos> Paige's plan is going like gangbusters so far.<eos> You're the shrink.<eos> Straighten Walt out.<eos> Well, my relationship with him is complicated.<eos> He's gonna think that I'm manipulating him, and he'll resist my help.<eos> It has to be you.
More than you realize!<eos> Look! We must've tapped the relief well too late.<eos> That silo's gonna go over!<eos> Get your man out of there now!<eos> Joe, abort!<eos> Get off now!<eos> Abort!<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Chief!<eos> Joe, don't move an inch or the silo will fall into that sinkhole with you in it!
Okay.<eos> It's interesting and has to do with the Supreme Court case,<eos> Kelo v. The City of New London.<eos> Listen, bozo, you ain't getting my vote.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> The rod broke!<eos> The 1920s steel must have been corroded.<eos> It's stuck.<eos> What do you mean it's stuck?<eos> Do I have to define "stuck" for you?
Seemed like your favorite part of the con.<eos> Yep. It felt great.<eos> Today wasn't like the old days.<eos> It was...<eos> Fun?<eos> I was going to say less traumatic, but also fun.<eos> Now for something less fun.<eos> We're being followed.<eos> Okay, let's review the plan:<eos> after you take me to Union Station, you file a complaint with the DA that I conned you and Scorpion out of some serious cash.
Or like a Cello Shell-o.<eos> Once it solidifies, it won't be able to seep into the aquifer.<eos> Exactly!<eos> Now we need something to mix the solution.<eos> I saw just the thing in the plant, but I'll need help.<eos> Doc, come on!<eos> We'll get the bags of mortar.<eos> Walter.<eos> We have a moment.<eos> You and I need to talk.
Happy wouldn't tell me.<eos> Master plan should come from the architect.<eos> Actually, it was your mom's idea.<eos> Well, Ralph,<eos> I didn't want Grandma to be on the run her whole life.<eos> The pit is deep and unstable, and if the silo falls, authorities believe the worker will be unrecoverable.<eos> That's when I got the idea.<eos> Walter.<eos> We have a moment.<eos> You and I need to talk.
The pit is deep and unstable, and if the silo falls, authorities believe the worker will be unrecoverable.<eos> That's when I got the idea.<eos> Walter.<eos> We have a moment.<eos> You and I need to talk.<eos> Oh.<eos> I assume you've heard I've been misbehaving.<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> We can deal with that later.<eos> But I need you to help save my mom?
This is a farce, Dad.<eos> You were wearing a wire.<eos> If I told you a lie, there was a reason.<eos> Talk to me like I'm your daughter, okay?<eos> I am right here.<eos> It's not what you think.<eos> Why isn't it?<eos> Here we are.<eos> I'm not doing this to save my skin.<eos> - They're coming after you.
They're just trying to establish that the witness is feeding negative info to the grand jury, so he can steal their clients.<eos> Exactly, Your Honor.<eos> Ma'am, you're an acquired taste, and... I don't think I've acquired it yet, so... shh.<eos> Please answer the question.<eos> I met for lunch with a Mr. Spiegel, who owns a string of department stores.<eos> Get to Spiegel.<eos> Hart's trying to poach him.<eos> - Are you in a pissy mood? - No.<eos> Then come by tonight.<eos> I've been told to break up with you.
No, I didn't.<eos> I told you more.<eos> - That's disbarrable. - Diane.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> We all know we get close to the line sometimes.<eos> Now, we try to stay on the right side of the law.<eos> You want to be a good lawyer, you need to get close to that line and you know that.<eos> This wasn't about being a good lawyer.<eos> This was about getting a new job.<eos> Not for you, for the Rindell kid, Diane.
Other than being friends with the wrong people?<eos> Then, do you think it surprises me that... someone inside this firm is being targeted?<eos> He has Henry Rindell in his pocket.<eos> He is going to get an indictment against me.<eos> Assume he does.<eos> I haven't been here that long, Adrian...<eos> What does that matter, Diane?<eos> I'm not running scared from motherfuckers like him.<eos> I got to fight him.<eos> You got to fight him.
Yeah, Diane did a lot of legal work for the Fund.<eos> Because she was your friend.<eos> No, because we paid her.<eos> Is that why you had me get the Schtup list from Uncle Jax's computer?<eos> So that you could use it against Diane?<eos> Make it look like she took a bribe?<eos> No, so I would have some leverage.<eos> You betrayed her for a lighter sentence?<eos> You won't see any jail time, Mom won't either.<eos> And you?
I don't want to die in prison, Maia.<eos> I want a chance to see you have kids.<eos> I want to hold my grandkids.<eos> What was the deal?<eos> Ten years.<eos> Don't testify against Diane.<eos> What?<eos> I have to.<eos> Dad, if they're offering ten years, they must have a weak case.<eos> It's for you, too.
Any last-minute advice?<eos> Nope.<eos> Just tell the truth.<eos> Anything you admit here can't be used against you, so take advantage of that.
How did this Ponzi scheme begin?<eos> Maia doesn't know how this Ponzi scheme began.<eos> Right, right.<eos> My apologies.<eos> Um, let me be a little more discursive.<eos> Let's look at this as:<eos> Remembrance of Ponzi Schemes Past?<eos> And, um, anything that comes into your mind about your parents or your Uncle Jackson, you just spill it, okay?<eos> And I'll just sit here and I'll write it down.<eos> Diane, I need you.
- I think we should take a break. - For lunch at this point.<eos> - I'd like to go. For a few more hours.<eos> No.<eos> Let's take a break.<eos> Sure.<eos> If you insist.<eos> Nat, you need to get some sleep.<eos> Yeah, what do you think I'm doing?<eos> We have another client who was brutalized by a cop.<eos> You do know I work for COPA, not for you?
She's trying to suggest you knew about the Ponzi Scheme, and that's why you waived Amy's parents off. - Yeah.<eos> I know.<eos> - Did you?<eos> No.<eos> You don't sound definite.<eos> Did you tell him my father's IRA comes to $110,000, that he's got another $30,000 in T-Bills?<eos> I don't know. I...<eos> You don't know if you waived Amy's parents off?<eos> I know this has been hard...<eos> I know these months have been hard on you, and you feel, rightly or wrongly, guilty for your parents' actions.
This is how we win. [whispering] Yeah.<eos> I am so sorry about the documents.<eos> Lucifer is an Australian paper hound, and they're bred to eat homework.<eos> [growls] Lucifer, hush.<eos> [Wendy] Oh, hold on, guys.<eos> For one, I don't think we should kill the dog.<eos> I'll just get another set of documents... um, somehow.<eos> Let me just- - Let me just make a call.<eos> -[Titus barks] Lucifer!<eos> I saw you gobble those papers, Kimbulimia, and I know why you did it.
[Orson chuckles]<eos> I want to thank you all for being here tonight, especially Stewart and Phoebe who delayed their honeymoon to Westworld... -Oh-ho-ho! -...so they could join us.<eos> That's a big deal.<eos> So here's to doing this again in five years, when I'll be 80, my organs will be 40, and I don't know how to do orangutan years, but my penis will be eight.<eos> -[all cheering and laughing]<eos> But in spite of everything, folks,<eos> I've become an old man, and I'm getting a little tired of the boardroom.<eos> And I'd rather be in Montana shooting salmon, so I've decided I'm not going to go to the NFL owners meeting this year.<eos> -[people gasping and murmuring] -[Orson] No, it's time to pass the torch to our new chairman and my best son, Duke.<eos> So-so-so you're not gonna be in charge? Duke is gonna be in charge?
So just tune that pasty Felicia out and think happy thoughts, like a toilet where you can lie down.<eos> [Wendy] Knock, knock.<eos> I almost forgot.<eos> Kimberly, Richard wants to marry me with his grandmother's wedding ring.<eos> I don't have it.<eos> No, his grandmother has it.<eos> But they're not on good terms for some reason. So can you talk to her?<eos> Would you excuse us for a moment, Wendy?<eos> You need to get out of this apartment.<eos> Let Wendy do Wendy, and you do you.
-Is an important part of who I am.<eos> Yes, perfect.<eos> Say crap like that.<eos> Until my little promotion today, I was head of PR for the Redskins.<eos> I won a Digie for my sweet tweets.<eos> But just imagine the optics of having a Native American in the family. We'll be bulletproof.<eos> What do you mean "in the family"?<eos> Let's get you and Russ married before God takes him.<eos> You'll never get me!<eos> I'm better than you!
We just decided no enemies.<eos> Well, lovely to meet you.<eos> You're Lucifer's mom?<eos> Oh, my gosh, you look amazing!<eos> I should start using sunscreen.<eos> A shame he kept you hidden.<eos> I hate secrets.<eos> Do you like shopping?<eos> Do I?<eos> I want to hear all about you and Lucifer.
Disappears, does stupid, impulsive things.<eos> But he always comes back around, Chloe.<eos> Yeah, but this time I don't want him to.<eos> I'm serious, I am done.<eos> I'm done.<eos> But he did get you an in with that mediator.<eos> That's a good thing, right?<eos> Yeah, well, I don't care.<eos> There's no way I'm letting him and his exotic-dancer wife on my case, or any case.<eos> Maybe you and Lucifer need a mediator.
Oh, no, no, no, that would he Lucifer disappearing, and then popping back up with zero explanation and a ditzy bimbo on his arm.<eos> He's cheated on you in five days of marriage?<eos> No, of course I didn't.<eos> I've been completely faithful.<eos> I take the vows of marriage very seriously.<eos> And that's why you chose an idiotic, bedazzled tweener as your partner.<eos> I'm sorry, Candy, there's no name calling in here.<eos> Even if it's to yourself.<eos> Lucifer, would you like to respond?<eos> This is gonna be hard for you to understand, but... I've been through Hell recently.
It's nice to be needed.<eos> Look, go home.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Candy needs you more than I do.<eos> Mine's bigger, right? Yes.<eos> Does that mean anything?<eos> Just how much Lucifer loves me.<eos> Ah, so these small ones are for couples who don't really care.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Tell me more about you and Lucifer.
Murder solved!<eos> And I believe that proves just how much the department needs me.<eos> Including you.<eos> Uh, we got a stalker, which is normally bad, but makes me very happy right now 'cause I was getting very uncomfortable.<eos> What on Earth does he want?<eos> You know I watched over Chloe for weeks after you disappeared, right?<eos> Angel or creeper, brother?<eos> It's a fine line.<eos> You asked me to guard her, so I did. Like an idiot!<eos> You see, because I thought that she meant something to you.
That she is.<eos> A whoopee cushion sent from Dad.<eos> I'm sure he's having a right old laugh at the moment. Right.<eos> So that means it's okay to turn your back on Chloe?<eos> Just ignore her feelings?<eos> Feelings she had no control over.<eos> Feelings that aren't real.<eos> But she doesn't know that.<eos> Which is why I had to save her from...<eos> From you.
Which is why I had to save her from...<eos> From you.<eos> You're not ignoring Chloe, you're protecting her because she had no choice.<eos> So I gave it back to her.<eos> By holding up a shield made of Candy.<eos> I'm sorry, Lucifer.<eos> You should at least explain some of this to Mom.<eos> She's upset.<eos> Good.<eos> She died and went to Hell for you, Luci.

By holding up a shield made of Candy.<eos> I'm sorry, Lucifer.<eos> You should at least explain some of this to Mom.<eos> She's upset.<eos> Good.<eos> She died and went to Hell for you, Luci.<eos> For you.<eos> She faced her greatest fears all because she loves you.<eos> - Oh, come on. - Yes, she hurt you.<eos> But she was just doing what she thought was best for you.
Besides, I'm far more pissed off at Dad.<eos> I mean, you just tried to speed up feelings I already had, whereas he...<eos> Well.<eos> He made all those feelings a lie.<eos> Anyway.<eos> Nice catching up.<eos> I'll see you in a few millennia.<eos> Lucifer, wait.<eos> I appreciate your honesty.<eos> And now, I'd like to be honest with you. Oh.
Thank you.<eos> I'll put them both to good use.<eos> 'Cause, you know, I totally have so many plans.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Well, to making plans.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> Lucifer.<eos> I get why you had me con your family.<eos> But what is going on with you and Detective Decker?
What if there is no hidden agenda, Mom?<eos> Why would I be surprised?<eos> You disappeared after I almost died?<eos> Does Chloe know that you zagged Candy?<eos> Everything I felt for her was smoke and mirrors, courtesy of Dad.<eos> So it's okay to ignore her feelings?<eos> Feelings that aren't real.<eos> But she doesn't know that.<eos> Which is why I had to save her!<eos> From you.
This is her contact info.<eos> Okay, I'll look into it.<eos> Is Trixie okay?<eos> I'll talk to her.<eos> I'll see you at the station, okay?<eos> You need to understand, I'm dealing with a most challenging issue...<eos> Yeah, I want to talk to my daughter for a second.<eos> Please don't be mad at him.<eos> I should be the one in trouble.<eos> I'm not mad at you.
Too much of that will make you go blind.<eos> Mom was right.<eos> I can't make it work.<eos> I see.<eos> You're up here practicing a different kind of self-flagellation, are you?<eos> Hoping for a celestial spark?<eos> You don't even have your powers.<eos> Yeah, thanks for that reminder, Luci.<eos> You know, I also don't seem to have much of Mom's attention anymore.<eos> Because, unlike you, I don't have some glorious destiny to wield the sword.
'Cause so far, it's just Mum's word against, well, reality.<eos> What if she's wrong, brother?<eos> She's been acting very odd recently.<eos> On edge.<eos> This obsession with getting home, it's a bit much, don't you think?<eos> You see, I thought we all wanted to go back.<eos> You know I don't lie, brother.<eos> So trust me when I say nothing would make me happier than Mum getting her wish.<eos> Then you need to stop fighting this, Luci, and find a way to get the sword to work.<eos> Because whether we like it or not, it is all on you.
My gun's in the car.<eos> Well, why didn't you tell me all this earlier?<eos> Put your hands up.<eos> Stay back!<eos> - Stay back! - Madison,<eos> - put down the gun. - Yes.<eos> Perhaps if you channel your feelings into something other than bullets, that might...<eos> I said stay back!<eos> Okay, got it.<eos> You!
But guess what I found out.<eos> What?<eos> That the other mommies, they were just as worried as I was.<eos> And they were just pretending to be perfect.<eos> Is it bad to pretend?<eos> No, not always, Monkey.<eos> I mean, sometimes people feel like... like they have to pretend that everything's okay.<eos> But...<eos> And this is the most important part...<eos> You and me, we never have to pretend with each other.
Everything I felt for her was smoke and mirrors, courtesy of Dad.<eos> Did you sleep with me to get intel on this case?<eos> Of course.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You don't let your girl go into enemy territory alone.<eos> The piece is here.<eos> My last words were a clue.<eos> A clue?<eos> A clue to what?<eos> Well, you're the one who has to figure that out, aren't you?
He changed his name and everything. Oh.<eos> You two should have a lot to talk about. Yes.<eos> I would like to have a chat with the Almighty.<eos> Cool your jets, man, all right?<eos> There's a whole bunch of bureaucratic hoops to jump through to set up an interview.<eos> The hospital administrator has all the info.<eos> Well, hello, God.<eos> Hello, my son.<eos> Right, yes, I suppose that would be the standard way to greet your children. Nice touch.<eos> What can I do for you?

Nice touch.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> Well, it's what I can do for you that's exciting.
I can't explain it.<eos> Because it's just crazy talk coming from a mentally ill human.<eos> Well, there might be another reason.<eos> Right.<eos> What's that?<eos> Well, Earth is His favorite toy.<eos> Maybe He got fed up of looking at it from afar.<eos> I mean, it's not an entirely awful place.<eos> Even you have to admit that.<eos> Now you're the one sounding crazy, Luci, because Earth...
Who stole my pudding again?<eos> Markowitz?<eos> Want a taste?<eos> Don't you have better things to do than to raid our fridge?<eos> I was about to leave this place altogether, but I hit an unexpected snag.<eos> Now I need to distract myself with something.<eos> Hello, something.<eos> You know, just in case I'm giving off an "I have zero self-respect" vibe, let me make it clear.<eos> Hands off.<eos> I'd rather sit at home alone, and in the dark, than to hang out with you.
Come.<eos> Very good.<eos> Let's go find you some pants.<eos> Dad.<eos> Of course, you're the murderer.<eos> Right, suppose I should thwart you now.<eos> Off to jail, cowboy.<eos> No, please, I have to save her.<eos> What do you mean, save her?<eos> It really is you.
Now, that's not the Samael I remember.<eos> No.<eos> No, Dad, this is who you made me when you cast me away!<eos> Now apologize!<eos> Uh, Lucifer?<eos> Guy sounds like he wants to bang.<eos> He's Lucifer's doctor, Maze.<eos> So what?<eos> Doctors don't want to get laid?<eos> Does everything always have to be about sex with you?
Mum and Dad together are their own worst punishment.<eos> It's genius.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> Only since the beginning of time.<eos> What is this?<eos> Where's Lucifer?<eos> Aw, who knows.<eos> That son of ours is unpredictable, to say the least.<eos> Husband?<eos> Is this really you?
I'm not Lucifer.<eos> I don't need what he needs.<eos> What I need is a friend.<eos> You want your privacy.<eos> Gotcha, Decker.<eos> Excuse my roommate.<eos> Sh... No, that's, uh, it's nothing compared to the, uh, intriguing folks I deal with at work. I can imagine.<eos> I-I actually would love to hear about that.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I wasn't planning on having sex with you again, but...
What's he doing here, Lucifer?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You married him.<eos> Well, it kind of ruins our plans to storm the Gates of Heaven and destroy him.<eos> Well, I'm thinking we might not need to do that anymore.<eos> I will never forgive him, if that's what you're getting at.<eos> The point is, Mum, that I think Dad... sincerely misses you.<eos> Well, of course I do.<eos> How could I not?<eos> Look at you.
That's pretty serious.<eos> You mind telling me why?<eos> Because... because I'm your son.<eos> And... you rejected me.<eos> Well, then I guess I can't say as I blame you.<eos> Fact of the matter is, I don't even remember why I was ever so angry with you to begin with.<eos> For what it's worth...<eos> I am sorry.<eos> I truly am.<eos> And I am proud of you, Samael.
Could we just hold each other?<eos> Please?<eos> With your pants off, of course.<eos> I still can't believe I gave all my money away.<eos> Well, if it's any consolation, you haven't exactly been yourself of late.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Listen, I wanted to ask you... what's the last thing you remember?<eos> I was in New Mexico for work,<eos> I was walking through this Navajo gift shop.<eos> I saw a cool belt buckle, so I picked it up, and... next thing I knew, I woke up strapped to a gurney next to you.
Let's go.<eos> The three of you plan to use... this Flaming Sword to cut through the gates of Heaven and go home.<eos> What does Maze think of your plan?<eos> Well, I don't know;<eos> I haven't told her. So what, are you going on a vacation?<eos> Lucifer didn't tell you.<eos> We're all going back to Heaven.<eos> She's been acting very odd recently, on edge.<eos> This obsession with getting home is a bit much, don't you think?<eos> That's because only you, my Lightbringer, can ignite it.
Lucifer, we need to talk about something.<eos> What... Can it wait?<eos> I'm busy keeping an eye on our mercurial mother.<eos> No, it's important.<eos> I think you might be in danger.<eos> Is it the Yakuza?<eos> The Nephilim?<eos> One Million Mums?<eos> It's Maze.<eos> She's angry with you, brother.
He has what we need in his safe in the back room.<eos> - Oh. - He's going to get it right now.<eos> Mum, you just handed him a briefcase full of cash with no proof whatsoever he has what we need.<eos> - And?<eos> - You've been conned.<eos> He's a client of mine, darling.<eos> I don't think he'd be that foolhardy.<eos> Well, I'm sure he'll be right back.<eos> Maybe we should go check just to be sure.<eos> I think that's a good idea, don't you?
Ms. Ruiz there... is my client.<eos> Well, she's a real piece of work.<eos> Trying to make me jealous?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> You seduce me, you betray me, now you're back.<eos> You have to want something, I just can't figure out what.<eos> I do want something, you're right.<eos> And I'll tell you.<eos> Just somewhere private.<eos> I'm not having sex with you here.
Good.<eos> It's settled.<eos> The detective and I will go, so thank you so much for your help.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> The invitation is under my name.<eos> I will go.<eos> Perhaps Detective Espinoza should join me.<eos> No. Yes, that's not happening.<eos> - Uh, very well.<eos> I'll go with you...
I'm so busy.<eos> I have been sidelined by my own mother and the detective.<eos> It's absurd.<eos> I won't stand for it.<eos> I am gonna find a way into that party.<eos> Do you always whine like this?<eos> I don't know how she puts up with it.<eos> Where's Dr. Linda?<eos> Suspended.<eos> Because of you.
You don't work for me.<eos> But I should.<eos> Look what I can do.<eos> Yeah, remove one of my best earners?<eos> You see, this is why you need me, Ma.<eos> I found out that Zeke was building up his own business.<eos> Smuggling up rare artifacts on the side.<eos> And I was making 30%.<eos> Oh. Well, I would have known that if you had just given me...<eos> How do the police know it was you?
Well, if there is one constant in the universe, it's that Lucifer's the favorite.<eos> No matter what I do.<eos> No matter how hard I work or how much he screws up.<eos> It's never gonna change.<eos> You guys must have competed over everything, huh?<eos> I mean, he would never admit it, right?<eos> But yeah.<eos> Yeah, everything.<eos> Even women?<eos> Eh, I just noticed that you and Lucifer have a weird relationship with Charlotte Richards.
But yeah.<eos> Yeah, everything.<eos> Even women?<eos> Eh, I just noticed that you and Lucifer have a weird relationship with Charlotte Richards.<eos> I just thought maybe you guys...<eos> No, Dan, we are not competing over Charlotte.<eos> Trust me.<eos> At least, not in the way you think.<eos> And if we are, well, obviously I lost.<eos> Because I'm here, with you.
Yeah, so you can catch your breath.<eos> And then, I'll get back to kicking your ass.<eos> See, now... I had no idea that you were this mad at me.<eos> You were gonna leave me.<eos> I would never do that.<eos> But you told Amenadiel and your mom that y... you were going with them to Heaven.<eos> Well, I didn't say how long for.<eos> Or what I was gonna do when I got there.<eos> You're playing your own angle.<eos> And you didn't tell me... because you needed me to be angry with you so you could sell your story.
I'll take care of this.<eos> I promise.<eos> Bianca.<eos> Has something happened?<eos> Yes.<eos> My son robbed and killed Zeke, as you know.<eos> But then he showed me what Zeke was smuggling.<eos> And for whom.<eos> Now I have it.<eos> And I think it's very important to you, isn't it? - It is.
I-I'm just anxious to see the rest of the family.<eos> Please start translating.<eos> There's something going on with her.<eos> Yeah. Or it's just that time of the millennium.<eos> What?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Not this time.<eos> - Hey. Congrats on nabbing Queen Tequila.<eos> Well, Chet's still out there, so this isn't over until I find him.<eos> You and Charlotte Richards... that is the most awkward team-up of the century.
Johnson's belt buckle.<eos> And the key that binds them all together.<eos> Well, keys don't bind, they unlock.<eos> I think someone needs to go back to translation school.<eos> And guess who has the key.<eos> Well, don't leave me in suspense.<eos> Who is it, brother?<eos> It says that God entrusted the key to his favorite son.<eos> Of course he gave it to you.<eos> It's always you, isn't it?
What else did you bring with you to Earth, Luci?<eos> Your ring.<eos> I've never seen you without it; maybe that's the key.<eos> Well, the key to completing my ensemble maybe.<eos> Here.<eos> Try and attach your ring to this.<eos> - Brother.<eos> - Just do it.<eos> And we'll confirm what we already know.<eos> - Brother... - That Father's favorite, despite everything that you have done, is and always has been you.

LAPD.<eos> Bianca Ruiz, you're under arrest.<eos> Are you certain this is all that was in the safety deposit box?<eos> We'll fix it.<eos> There's plenty of time.<eos> Just not for me.<eos> God shattered the Flaming Sword into three distinct pieces.<eos> The Blade of Death, the Medallion of Life and the Key that binds them all together.<eos> Look down.<eos> He entrusted it to you.
Dad is manipulating us six ways to Sunday.<eos> But, hey, what's new?<eos> At least we have it now.<eos> So...<eos> Well, hand it over, Brother.<eos> The sword's not gonna ignite itself.<eos> It... oh, just give it to me.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Right, don't be silly, Brother.<eos> You know I'm ten times stronger than you.
Well, maybe our poor killer's just chaetophobic.<eos> Fear of hair.<eos> Always fun when they turn up in Hell.<eos> Lots of wigs involved.<eos> But I'm pretty sure... this guy got a bath in bleach.<eos> So, whoever dumped him is a pro.<eos> It's like he just vanished off the face of the Earth.<eos> I know.<eos> But it's pretty tough for someone to cover every track.<eos> If anyone can find something, it's you, Ella.
I notice you've changed your look.<eos> Where's your pretty necklace?<eos> Oh, I've put it in a safe place.<eos> Ah. Keister it, did you?<eos> Nope. Already checked.<eos> Not there.<eos> Lovely.<eos> Listen, Amenadiel, I need the final piece.<eos> Right.<eos> So you and Mom can slice through the Gates of Heaven and destroy Father.
Yeah.<eos> I know.<eos> Right.<eos> Maze, darling, would you mind running down to the wine cellar and fetching Mum?<eos> I think she'd like to hear this.<eos> I've been thinking about this, deeply.<eos> And I think that we've been looking at things the wrong way.<eos> That necklace was a gift.<eos> It's not some manipulation.<eos> Well, you only think that because it was gifted to you.
Get some air.<eos> I was feeling a little claustrophobic.<eos> Don't you just hate being kept in the dark?<eos> The good news is you found Amenadiel.<eos> So we have the piece?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, interesting story, actually.<eos> Why don't you tell her, Brother?<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> This one's all you.
Oh, I'm not angry.<eos> Just disappointed.<eos> Give me the piece!<eos> No, Mom.<eos> You're gonna have to kill me.<eos> Guess I'll have to find another way, won't I?<eos> Well, now look what you've made her do.<eos> I've just had this tuned!<eos> Me?<eos> How about you suggesting Hell as a retirement home?
Looking for little ol' me?<eos> You were right, dear.<eos> Your detective is quite good.<eos> She caught me.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Santa Monica Pier.<eos> Such a beautiful place.<eos> So many people.<eos> If you hurt anyone, Mum, if you hurt her...<eos> And if you and your brother had just given me what I needed.
Lucifer.<eos> No!<eos> Bloody hell, it worked.<eos> I guess it can cut through anything, even the world itself.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's-it's nothing.<eos> At least, for now.<eos> This is the real way to move forward, Mum.<eos> To create a whole new world, your own world, without Father.<eos> But what about you?
They wanna match wits with me, see if I can catch them.<eos> Do not take this lightly.<eos> This is your next Blacklister.<eos> But you don't even know who this is.<eos> He's killed a federal judge, which means he goes after high profile targets.<eos> He left clues at your doorstep, which means it's a game to him, one he'll keep playing until you stop him.<eos> You're being baited, Elizabeth, taunted by a killer who knows where you live.<eos> ♪ hey!<eos> ♪<eos> ♪ what I like about you ♪

A respected judge, a controversial businessman.<eos> Why target them?<eos> Why are they connected?<eos> I only know what I see in the dioramas.<eos> Why haven't you taken these premonitions to the police?<eos> I have.<eos> They looked at me like I'm crazy.<eos> That's why I came to you, Agent Keen.<eos> I saw you at the grocery store, recognized you from the news.<eos> I followed you home because I thought you'd understand.
The guy's in uniform.<eos> Great.<eos> Well, she's gotta be close.<eos> We could call out to her if she could only hear us.<eos> Maybe she can.<eos> How?<eos> Police radios operate on an RF frequency just like Maggie's hearing device, which can cause interference.<eos> All right, go to frequency 154.400 and turn it up.<eos> Turn it all the way up.<eos> What is wrong with you?
I used to be scared of those guys.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> You got it?<eos> We could use a little peace and quiet in our lives.<eos> Dembe.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> No.<eos> Please come in.<eos> I'm worried about Raymond.<eos> I don't think he cares about anything or anyone in the world right now other than you or Agnes.
Previously on "You Me Her"...<eos> We're together.<eos> We're a throuple.<eos> I got a connection at Griffin College, and they're expanding their psych department.<eos> So I will get you a meeting, little brother.<eos> Do you even want to be a college professor?<eos> I mean, 'cause I don't want to push you into anything. Pbht.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> I just can't help but feel a little bit Lori-esque, like maybe we've become uncool.<eos> So, you're saying that we're provincial and we're judgmental because, - what, we're not cool anymore? - No. [Chuckles] N... no.
I am just a kindly mother giving her daughter a ride... all the way to the main steps.<eos> That's for Freshmen and Sophomores!<eos> And Juniors who conspire with pervy neighbors against their own mothers.<eos> What...<eos> What is that about?<eos> Do not imagine killing me in my sleep.<eos> - Wore that one out. - Whoa, whoa. Unh-unh.<eos> Get back in.<eos> That is an order.<eos> I'm making a silent vow to never, ever end up like you.
That is an order.<eos> I'm making a silent vow to never, ever end up like you.<eos> That's not silent.<eos> I can hear you.<eos> Well, oops. Guess the cat's out of the bag.<eos> I may as well start immediately.<eos> I'm gonna ask myself, "WWLD...<eos> What would Lori do?"<eos> And then I'm gonna do the exact opposite.<eos> Look at you, thinking you're getting to me.
That was such a dick move that I have tried so hard to forget.<eos> Um, I married mine, too.<eos> - I'm not sensing a happy ending. - [Chuckles]<eos> I wanted kids.<eos> He wasn't ready.<eos> Now he has two with someone else.<eos> Look, I'm not trying to make excuses, but I could tell that your parents didn't like me.<eos> I always wondered, was it an ethnic thing?<eos> Oh, yeah, 'cause you're so Third World, and my dynastic fox-hunting family would've never accepted you as anything but the maid?<eos> You did manage to find a chick whiter than you.
Yeah. I... I do that when I'm nervous.<eos> Look...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Antioxidants, Omega-3, Spirulina and alkaline, all in one bottle?<eos> I have no clue what any of those things are, yet I'm convinced I can't live without them.<eos> So, as they say, about last night?<eos> Get over it.<eos> It wasn't that bad.<eos> It was that bad with a dollop of shit on top.<eos> Not sure what was cringier, you and Izzy publicly vacuuming each other's mouths or Jack awkwardly watching it.
What, should I wear a bisexual I.D. badge?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> You're kidding me, right?<eos> After almost a decade of marriage to the love of my life and...<eos> - and you're wondering...<eos> - I'm wondering because Jack's wondering.<eos> We're in love.<eos> All three of us.<eos> - Why... why can't you just...<eos> - Who are you pitching this to, me or you?
I just want to help as many kids as possible get safely and sanely to the other side of 18.<eos> I'm starting to think I want the job I walked away from.<eos> Or some version of that.<eos> Oh, shit. I got a thing.<eos> Um, can I see you again?<eos> Like, just for coffee or something?<eos> Confession?<eos> I had created this kind of dark fantasy in my mind about what it would be like if we ever saw each other again.<eos> [Laughs] How did it measure up?<eos> Is divorced enough for you?
I know it's fast, but it's like I snapped out of this coma and she was the first face that I saw.<eos> I'm guessing that Nina is scary because she's scared.<eos> Listen to that man.<eos> That is some profound shit.<eos> So, you got to hold her close, man.<eos> Got to hold her real tight, like a... autism blanket, until the spasms and the fits subside.<eos> - And then we're good? - No.<eos> Then she'll have even more fits and more spasms.<eos> That's fuckin' awful.<eos> But then, at the end of that, at least she'll finally believe in you.
- Well, we don't, so get over it. - Okay.<eos> This is probably me making this unnecessarily weird, but, um... you ever think about me over the last dozen years?<eos> - Um... - Oh, God. That was so stupid.<eos> - I'm sorry. Yeah, no. - No.<eos> - That...<eos> - Rewind.<eos> - Your watch is on the other wrist, by the way.<eos> - so, I will call you and...<eos> And yes.<eos> Yeah, of course I've thought of you.
No fucking clue what that means.<eos> You know those stupid $300-a-pair jeans they make just so people like us can embarrass ourselves?<eos> So, no pink highlights?<eos> - I mean, you're Asian, so that's...<eos> - Right.<eos> - Human animé.<eos> Walking cliché. - Yeah.<eos> So, what are we gonna do then?<eos> Don't react right away.<eos> Let it wash over you.
I'm kidding, obviously.<eos> Right, that's clear?<eos> - I'm clear that I'm obviously kidding? - No, no, no. No, no, no, no.<eos> No. We're desperate. I...<eos> I don't hate it.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Ahh, pizza, wine, weed.<eos> [Sighs] This whole thing is amazing, Iz.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Yeah, look at you.
- Ka-fucking-blam! - Okay.<eos> Okay, just let me get this straight.<eos> So, you get to "undercurrent" all over your primary ex because you've decided that I'm not fluid, I'm a lesbian?<eos> That's right. Jack told the Amaris I might be full-blown gay.<eos> That's not at all what I said.<eos> So, I guess that means that you've decided for me too?<eos> Are you the official Minister of Sexual Orientation?<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - You know what? Fuck you, Jack.<eos> Fuck you and your fragile, little male ego.
- The auditor will start by joining Peralta and Santiago on their gang stakeout because...<eos> - They're America's dream couple.<eos> - You need to calm down.<eos> - We're in a workplace.<eos> Because their case is a good example of the type of serious crime that still exists in our neighborhood.<eos> Looks like the auditor is here.<eos> - Isn't that Teddy...<eos> - Amy's ex-boyfriend?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Jake, didn't you break them up?
- Mobility. It's a good thing I still have my sexy-cat costume from Halloween.<eos> - I really don't think you were the target audience for that item.<eos> - There is nothing gendered about a sexy cat.<eos> Now, please hand me that big jug of wolf pee I rub on my kid.<eos> - Okay, Teddy, let's not evaluate rashly here, all right?<eos> It's a misunderstanding.<eos> We're not saying pilsners are boring.<eos> We're saying that we are too boring to appreciate them properly...<eos> - Is what I'm going with.<eos> - Jake, I agree with you.
No one cares about your sneakers, Jake.<eos> - Yeah, very convincing.<eos> - We're just glad you guys made it.<eos> This is Rachel, my girlfriend.<eos> - Hi.<eos> So Teddy said you guys had such a blast<eos> - at the stakeout.<eos> - Yes, it was incredible.<eos> Can I really quickly just say the real reason we were late was that Amy insisted on brushing her teeth for 30 minutes?<eos> - Two minutes or one minute, 58 seconds longer than you did.
I care about them deeply.<eos> They're all so different.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Hey, guys, it's Teddy from jazz brunch.<eos> - Hey, Teddy.<eos> It's Teddy from jazz brunch.<eos> - Why is he here?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> But the fake fight's back on.<eos> So shut it, you bigmouthed bitch and your stupid sneakers!
- Uh-oh.<eos> - Okay. Okay, everybody just calm down and take a deep breath.<eos> What the hell is going on, man?<eos> - Yeah, what the hell is going on?<eos> - You've got a girlfriend.<eos> - I know. - And she's fine.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Sorry. - I was really planning on you being in the cab during this.<eos> - Okay, that wouldn't make it better.<eos> - No. - Amy, I'm just... I'm not over you yet, and I would've never said anything, because I thought you and Jake were happy, but after seeing you at jazz brunch,
- I feel compelled to tell you that San Diego's terrible.<eos> - I'm gonna lay it all on the line.<eos> Amy Santiago... will you marry me?<eos> - What?<eos> - What? - Okay, really, could you stay in the cab?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> I promise.<eos> Or maybe I won't.<eos> What's your answer? - Teddy, I don't want to be with you.
I-I'm sorry.<eos> You can watch.<eos> Unless you have any objections.<eos> Uh, it... it...<eos> it's your first day back,<eos> - and I think that...<eos> - And it's a pretty big operation, Pierce.<eos> Yeah, yeah, exactly.<eos> So send me the chart.<eos> Well, it was nice almost working with you.
Now's the part where you guys are supposed to tell me how awesome I am, like I do for you all the time.<eos> - We're sorry.<eos> - You are awesome.<eos> - Okay, don't.<eos> - And I was having a great day.<eos> I found a special surgery that I was excited about, that I knew I could excel at, and I wasn't worried for one second about whether I'd be able to perfect it... not for one second until you guys got here,<eos> and now I am a little worried, so thank you for your support.<eos> I don't understand why you just can't say the words.<eos> - I was not wrong.<eos> You were.
So, we just opened a big box of TB?<eos> Wait...<eos> TB's transmitted through the air.<eos> Should we close?<eos> I mean, are you sure we're not exposing ourselves?<eos> Well, I've already been exposed. I have the antibodies.<eos> Also, I'm not a gutless wuss.<eos> So, pick up some Metz.<eos> I don't have the antibodies.<eos> Do you?
Hey, have you left the country recently?<eos> Uh... just a Baja cruise with my mom.<eos> Oh, and India for a month volunteering.<eos> Nobody noticed I was gone?<eos> You got TB, pal.<eos> TB?<eos> Wait. You fixed me, right?<eos> - Well, Dr. Kepner did.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Listen, I just wanted to apologize for giving you a hard time earlier and for sticking you in a duck gown.
She's a mess.<eos> Okay. Can we reschedule?<eos> I have... You can't be here.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> "Come on"?<eos> Okay, you weren't supposed to hear that.<eos> - Her mother just died.<eos> - I know.<eos> But, come on, you and I both know how grief comes and goes.
Is she...?<eos> Skydiving.<eos> - My mother is afraid of heights.<eos> - Well...<eos> This is insane!<eos> She's insane.<eos> In the best way.<eos> She gave these to you?<eos> She didn't come to see me because I was the best... she came here because she knew that she was dying.<eos> And you and I...
- My mother is afraid of heights.<eos> - Well...<eos> This is insane!<eos> She's insane.<eos> In the best way.<eos> She gave these to you?<eos> She didn't come to see me because I was the best... she came here because she knew that she was dying.<eos> And you and I...<eos> We're kind of like family.<eos> She figured I would do my best to take care of you, and she was right.
What are you doing here?<eos> I'm going to a conference.<eos> National Conference on... Operative Advances.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> You didn't mention you were going.<eos> Neither did you.<eos> You sure you're not following me?<eos> What?<eos> You just found a way to move into my row.<eos> I should be asking you if you're following me.
There's no room in here.<eos> Well, I do need to talk to you.<eos> That's all you've been doing.<eos> Yeah, without someone sitting in between us and you closing your eyes.<eos> Well, make it quick, because I have to pee.<eos> All right, well, you've had a lot to say lately, about us, about how you don't think we should be together.<eos> Yes.<eos> I've been very clear.<eos> Yes, you were, and I think I need to be clear, too.<eos> You and I... this is something.
Hey. Sorry. Can you...<eos> Do you have any antacids or anything?<eos> I'm sure someone does.<eos> Ask around.<eos> No.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Can you touch my head?<eos> Do... Do I have a fever, do you think?<eos> Does it feel hot?<eos> You, too, huh?
Everything's been shaken up, undone, turned on its head.<eos> At some point, you got to let go.<eos> I don't really want to talk about this.<eos> Good.<eos> I don't want to talk. I don't want to talk about it.<eos> I don't want to talk at all, okay?<eos> I just want to...<eos> I want to move forward.<eos> I want to live my life 'cause I'm still here.<eos> I've still got one, and so do you.

I don't want to talk about it.<eos> I don't want to talk at all, okay?<eos> I just want to...<eos> I want to move forward.<eos> I want to live my life 'cause I'm still here.<eos> I've still got one, and so do you.<eos> Don't look at me like that, like I don't know what I'm talking about 'cause you know I do.<eos> That could have been you in that seat with no seat belt.
I just want to...<eos> I want to move forward.<eos> I want to live my life 'cause I'm still here.<eos> I've still got one, and so do you.<eos> Don't look at me like that, like I don't know what I'm talking about 'cause you know I do.<eos> That could have been you in that seat with no seat belt.<eos> Yeah, but it wasn't.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm just fine.<eos> And so are you.
Hi.<eos> Mary, I'm gonna just gently palpate your abdomen to check for tenderness, okay?<eos> Yeah, abdomen's distended.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Ow!<eos> Hang in there, noodle.<eos> You're doing great.<eos> I hate that you're seeing me like this.<eos> You hurt, I hurt, sugarbear.<eos> I'm here for you.
No, it's fine.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Edwards, um, admit her, and, uh, page Dr. Webber.<eos> I'm just gonna go...<eos> Go wash the puke out of your hair?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Here you go.<eos> I can't believe you saw me yak.<eos> I-I am so disgusting.<eos> No.<eos> It's real, just like you.
Richard's not sitting with Catherine.<eos> O-Okay.<eos> You need to leave that man alone.<eos> Agreed.<eos> I'm moving on to Catherine.<eos> Their marriage is not your lane.<eos> Your lane is over here with me.<eos> Stay in it.<eos> I mean it, Miranda.<eos> You're right. My lane is with you in this marriage.
It's...<eos> It's too soon.<eos> - He's still too little.<eos> - You're at 34 weeks.<eos> I've delivered way smaller babies than this.<eos> Yours should be just fine.<eos> And the safest option is a C-section.<eos> And I'll be there to handle any spinal-cord issues.<eos> If they deliver today... then that's two months with the baby.<eos> That's you and me... and the little boy.
- and I will talk to him.<eos> - Worms?<eos> Your patient threw up worms?<eos> There was only one.<eos> That's one too many.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> I have a quadruple-bypass surgery, so...<eos> We should talk about me and Nathan.<eos> So there is a "you and Nathan"?
Before Amelia and Owen's wedding.<eos> But it started before I even knew you liked him, and as soon as you told me you liked him, I called it off.<eos> We talked about it!<eos> - I...<eos> - You let me go on and on!<eos> I was going to tell you, and then your mother died, and then I just couldn't.<eos> I didn't want to hurt you, and Nathan didn't want to hurt you.<eos> No.<eos> This isn't about Nathan.<eos> It's you!
We talked about it!<eos> - I...<eos> - You let me go on and on!<eos> I was going to tell you, and then your mother died, and then I just couldn't.<eos> I didn't want to hurt you, and Nathan didn't want to hurt you.<eos> No.<eos> This isn't about Nathan.<eos> It's you!<eos> I trusted you to be honest with me, when even my mother lied to me, and now she's dead.<eos> I thought I could count on you to tell me the truth.
Just give them another damn minute.<eos> Jer, can you take him?<eos> He needs to go to the NICU now.<eos> And, uh, what... what about Veronica?<eos> She's in good hands.<eos> She'll be just fine.<eos> I'll take good care of her.<eos> Jer, you stay with him.<eos> You promised.<eos> I'm counting on you.
She is a hard woman to talk to.<eos> Mm.<eos> So are you.<eos> I know.<eos> But it's because I'm usually right and people are wrong, and it's hard for them.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Catherine usually thinks she's right, too.<eos> Are you saying that I just think that I'm right?<eos> No, I'm saying...<eos> I'm saying you and Catherine Avery are very similar women.
I was wrong.<eos> I had a patient full of worms today.<eos> Did you take any pictures?<eos> What?<eos> Did I...<eos> You know who you're talking to?<eos> Come here.<eos> I didn't mean to hurt you.<eos> That's the last thing I would ever want.<eos> ♪ No, they never do Because I care about you more than anything.
So, no matter how mad you are, how much you want to shut me out, know this...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What does it look like I'm doing?<eos> Didn't Amelia tell you?<eos> She's waiting in the car.<eos> The sitter's upstairs.<eos> We're going out.<eos> Well, if you want to go out so bad, why don't you call Riggs?<eos> I'm busy.<eos> I want to go out with you.
I want to go out with you.<eos> Meredith.<eos> Stop.<eos> No. I won't.<eos> I am very sorry that I screwed up and I hurt you.<eos> But you're my sister.<eos> And I'm sure as hell not losing you over a guy.<eos> Please come out with me.<eos> ...you are my sister, whether you like it or not...<eos> I'm still mad at you.
Please come out with me.<eos> ...you are my sister, whether you like it or not...<eos> I'm still mad at you.<eos> That's okay.<eos> I may only talk to Amelia.<eos> Well, she's been sitting in the car waiting for us for like 10 minutes, so she may not talk to either one of us.<eos> ...and I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> We named that one Geraldine.<eos> Oh, look at you.
I may only talk to Amelia.<eos> Well, she's been sitting in the car waiting for us for like 10 minutes, so she may not talk to either one of us.<eos> ...and I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> We named that one Geraldine.<eos> Oh, look at you.<eos> So silly.<eos> You are just too much.<eos> Edwards was right in her element there.<eos> And you right along with her.
Holy...<eos> And, uh, you know, you can just ignore that.<eos> It's just something I have.<eos> Is it sharp, like someone stabbing you really hard, or throbbing... like a ball bouncing against your head?<eos> It just hurts.<eos> Sometimes I feel like I've been spinning.<eos> Like you're dizzy?<eos> Okay. Constant pain. Intermittent dizziness.<eos> It could be vestibular.<eos> Can you tell us who takes care of you?
But some patients mentally can't process that.<eos> Choose wisely, then.<eos> Well, since the MESS score is borderline, we have to look for other indicators.<eos> Uh, the LSI, the PSI could give us a clearer picture of the ischemia, the bone/muscle damage, and the extent of the vascular injury.<eos> Warren, you're not writing a research paper.<eos> You're treating a patient on a morphine drip.<eos> Make a call.<eos> Uh, well, according to these numbers,<eos> I say we amputate, then.<eos> Here's a number for you, Warren... 27.
Uh, listen, do you want to get a beer?<eos> Ugh. I have a teratoma excision at 7:00<eos> I have to read up on, but tomorrow?<eos> Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure, tomorrow.<eos> - Hey, Jo?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> I'm good, actually.<eos> Talking to you is probably one of the only good things to come out of this year.
I'm sorry.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> You...<eos> You lucked out, Missy.<eos> 'Cause I am the best surgeon in here.<eos> I do this kind of stuff in my sleep.<eos> Ah! Okay. All right.<eos> We're gonna figure this out, okay, right?<eos> Just you and me, right?
You...<eos> You lucked out, Missy.<eos> 'Cause I am the best surgeon in here.<eos> I do this kind of stuff in my sleep.<eos> Ah! Okay. All right.<eos> We're gonna figure this out, okay, right?<eos> Just you and me, right?<eos> - We'll figure it out. - Okay, okay.<eos> Right?<eos> Just you and me.
I yelled at Jackson when I shouldn't have...<eos> Well, he was an idiot, and he almost died, so...<eos> I just meant that, you know...<eos> He's your baby's father, and I went too far.<eos> I was just mad because he and I had been talking earlier when the alarms went off...<eos> What?<eos> Jackson, he, uh... He likes you.<eos> I know him, so I know what that looks like.<eos> And, uh...<eos> He likes you. He has feelings for you.
I just got fired.<eos> I'm so sorry, but you know I'm gonna have to do this again today, right?<eos> Oh, it's looking good, it's looking good.<eos> Edwards, I can turn up the morphine.<eos> You don't need to be in this much pain.<eos> Not yet, not yet.<eos> How're you feeling?<eos> I've had better days.<eos> - Your burns are severe. - Mm-hmm.<eos> But we are all with you.
All right, man, okay. Don't be so aggressive.<eos> - Movies. - You're getting into the movie industry?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - You're getting into the movie industry?<eos> - That's dope.<eos> - I came up with this compelling story.<eos> - Word? You're writing movies?<eos> - I'm writing it now.<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> - And I think you'll be great for the role.
Oh, snap! It's the ghost of Richard Nixon!<eos> Good evening, brothers!<eos> Yo, don't call us brothers.<eos> My apologies.<eos> Would you prefer "Negroes"?<eos> Uh, just call us brothers.<eos> Very well, then, nigger... Brothers!<eos> I overheard your conversation regarding the War on Drugs.<eos> I'm extremely disappointed.<eos> I mean, you would be. You started it.
Yeah, but the fact that you want to tell her, even though you don't need to, means that you've changed.<eos> Do you think Emma will see it that way?<eos> I think maybe you need to find out.<eos> Did you find any sign of him?<eos> - No.<eos> - There was nothing in the North Woods, either.<eos> Why am I not surprised you couldn't find him?<eos> Could it be because you were the one who lost him in the first place?<eos> If you're looking for a fairy to take your anger out on, perhaps you should find your mother.<eos> Well, since the Black Fairy is trapped in another realm, I suppose I'll have to make do with you.
I-I came to apologize.<eos> I-I might have put pressure on you to be someone you're not.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I-I think it's taking me a little longer to get used to this world than I imagined.<eos> Well, let me help you. I...<eos> No.<eos> Regina, really, that's not necessary.<eos> Says the man who's hiding in the woods, pointing a bow and arrow at everything that moves.<eos> Well, when you put it like that...<eos> Why don't I meet you at your manse tonight?
She just laughed, and she said, "We'll see about that."<eos> That night, she took the boy in the cell across from mine.<eos> She dragged him to her tower, where she whipped him.<eos> I could hear his cries echo through the halls, begging for someone to stop her.<eos> I reached out to the door of my cell, and it was open.<eos> I had a chance to save him.<eos> But I didn't. I just... I just sat there, listening to his cries.<eos> She left the door unlocked on purpose.<eos> To show me I didn't have what it takes.<eos> I was a coward, Father, just like you.
The only monster down here is the Dark One.<eos> You killed those villagers.<eos> I didn't.<eos> You did.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> So he can be the hero he thinks he was meant to be.<eos> We would have won that war without your dark magic!<eos> You would have died.<eos> Everyone would have died!<eos> And doing this now won't make you a hero.
That's not how it ends.<eos> That's not how it ever ends.<eos> The Black Fairy destroyed your childhood.<eos> Don't let her destroy the rest of your life.<eos> You don't get a say in the matter.<eos> Dark One, who forged this blade?<eos> Whose blood do I need?<eos> The Blue Fairy's.<eos> My Fairy Godmother?<eos> There's good in you, Gideon.
Do you really think I wouldn't notice my magic was missing?<eos> - I can explain.<eos> - Oh, you mean lie to me again?<eos> You said you came here because you wanted to find meaning in your life.<eos> Was any of that true?<eos> I truly wanted to find a purpose here, but you made it so hard.<eos> How did I make it hard?<eos> All I did was try to help you.<eos> By bringing me somewhere where I'm constantly reminded of somebody that I'm not.<eos> Regina, I can't live up to the legacy of a man who died for you.
If I had all the ingredients to break the protection spell, do you really think I wouldn't have done it already?<eos> So, we're trapped here?<eos> I bet you're happy now.<eos> Robin, I know you want to leave, but you don't understand the world out there.<eos> It's not like where you're from.<eos> I can handle myself, Regina.<eos> I know.<eos> If you really want to leave, I'll dig through every book I have to figure out how to break the protection spell.<eos> You will?<eos> I owe it to him... to you... to let you find your happiness... even if it means helping you walk out of here.

You're just like your father.<eos> You don't have it in you.<eos> Dark One, I summon thee!<eos> I told you to stay away from my son.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Kill me.<eos> Then your boy will see that you are a monster.<eos> I'm taking you back to the village, and I'm telling them the truth.<eos> You think they'll believe you?<eos> They're afraid of you, Rumple.
Then your boy will see that you are a monster.<eos> I'm taking you back to the village, and I'm telling them the truth.<eos> You think they'll believe you?<eos> They're afraid of you, Rumple.<eos> They watched you bring an army of Ogres to their knees.<eos> They know it's only a matter of time before you turn that dagger on them.<eos> He's right, Papa.<eos> They'll never believe us.<eos> Then we'll find a new village, Bae.<eos> We'll start over, you and me.
You were supposed to protect me when I was just a baby.<eos> I know.<eos> I tried.<eos> But the Black Fairy...<eos> she was too strong.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't be.<eos> You may not have been able to help me back then, but maybe you can now.<eos> No.<eos> Killing Emma with that blade... it... it will not make you the Savior the way that you think.
Please don't do this.<eos> Don't make this any harder than it has to be.<eos> Gideon, stop.<eos> Father, what are you doing here?<eos> I watched one son darken his heart long ago.<eos> I can't watch another do the same.<eos> You can't stop me.<eos> I command you.<eos> I'm not here to stop you.<eos> I'm here to do it for you.
What?<eos> What happened to him?<eos> It...<eos> It's not important.<eos> You killed him.<eos> Papa, how could you?<eos> I'm sorry, Bae.<eos> I did what I had to do.<eos> Beowulf was right.<eos> That dagger is turning you into a monster.
You see, there's something I need to tell you.<eos> It's just, what I have to say isn't exactly easy, and I'm not entirely sure how you're gonna react.<eos> Well, maybe I can make it easier and tell you that my answer would be yes.<eos> Yes?<eos> I...<eos> What was the question?<eos> I might have found something in your sea chest that I shouldn't have.<eos> Are you mad at me?<eos> No.<eos> How could I ever be mad at you?

And maybe to... apologize.<eos> I shouldn't have gone behind your back and helped Robin escape.<eos> No.<eos> This one's my fault.<eos> Your fault?<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's go with that, then.<eos> How did I ever think that removing my evil half would change anything?<eos> When I saw Robin in that alternate world, it was a test... to see if I could move forward, and I failed.<eos> Well, I thought I was rid of you for good, Queenie, but I guess I'll always be paying the price for what you did... what I did.

Hope that didn't sting.<eos> A...<eos> A bit of that anti-magic potion stuck to you in the blast.<eos> And, well, as you can see, I needed some.<eos> So, thanks.<eos> I just left you at the town line.<eos> You left Regina at the town line.<eos> You are Regina.<eos> I'm the Evil Queen.<eos> You, of all people, should recognize a Doppelganger when you see one.
So, thanks.<eos> I just left you at the town line.<eos> You left Regina at the town line.<eos> You are Regina.<eos> I'm the Evil Queen.<eos> You, of all people, should recognize a Doppelganger when you see one.<eos> There's two of us now.<eos> I don't care if there's seven of you now.<eos> I'm leaving as soon as possible.<eos> Well, that's a shame... because there's nothing for you out there.

You don't have to confront me in the middle of a store.<eos> You know what?<eos> Just go ahead and pay for the gift, and I'll meet you outside.<eos> I can't talk to you right now.<eos> Fine.<eos> What happened?<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> They thought I was stealing pizza scarf.<eos> Well, I have some good news, then.<eos> I got you a gift.
"Toadally smashed."<eos> I love it!<eos> My nephew has the same shirt.<eos> Told you guys.<eos> God, we need some drinks, guys.<eos> - Yeah. - Yes, please.<eos> I'm still bummed we couldn't get bottle service.<eos> Man, you never had $800 in your life.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - I make more tips than you.
I know.<eos> Is there something else we could do?<eos> Death Castle's playing! We have to go.<eos> I've heard it's amazing.<eos> - I love Nicolas Cage.<eos> - Me too.<eos> DeShawn?<eos> DeShawn?<eos> Uh, DeShawn, are you up there?<eos> DeShawn, is that you?
You sure you weren't an actor?<eos> Well, not unless you include John of gaunt in the bath.<eos> This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle, this earth of majesty, this seat of Mars, this...<eos> Agent Thomas? Seems our search for dreyfuss is nearing a conclusion.<eos> Something amiss?<eos> You ever get that feeling like... Someone just walked over your grave?<eos> In my case, that may have actually happened.<eos> Twice.<eos> It's nice to see you back in touch with your sartorial senses.<eos> Coming from you, that is high praise indeed, my friend.
This is actually our home as well as our business.<eos> But you can look at the web site.<eos> I'm a dhs agent.<eos> Are you?<eos> Michelle Obama and her family just ate here last week.<eos> Right. Well, in that case, a reservation for two.<eos> Our next available booking is six weeks out.<eos> I'm so psyched you're on board, mills.<eos> I'm still running point, yes?<eos> Yeah. It's all you.
If she is arma mutata, does she want it for the same reason as dreyfuss?<eos> To raise the horseman of war?<eos> You know what this weapon is, do you not?<eos> Do you know what it's meant to do?<eos> I know that if you don't let me go, something terrible will happen.<eos> Dreyfuss has got security patrols all over the area.<eos> Okay, what's our next move?<eos> I'm not always gonna be around to call the shots.<eos> What would you do in this situation without me?<eos> Jenny, we wouldn't be in this situation without you.
What did he do to you?<eos> He just touched me, and it burned.<eos> Down to my soul.<eos> And then... he killed you.<eos> I know it didn't really happen, but it felt like it did.<eos> It was so real, Alex.<eos> It felt so real.<eos> You were really brave, Jake.<eos> When jobe looked at me, he kind of, like... Looked inside.<eos> And he said that thing about... How I felt about you.
Molly? My god.<eos> Yesterday was the last day that I remember seeing you alive.<eos> After the Washington play, I went to a sleepover at my friend's house, and in the morning, they... Just told me you were gone.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> So sorry to interrupt, but I have to ask, the world series... do the cubs ever get there again, or was that just a one-off?<eos> Just leave her, Malcolm.<eos> Choose someone else.<eos> You don't need her.<eos> No, no, no, I... Of course I need her.<eos> Otherwise, how will I mold little Molly into you?
You don't need her.<eos> No, no, no, I... Of course I need her.<eos> Otherwise, how will I mold little Molly into you?<eos> You will never get the chance.<eos> Actually, I've already begun on that front, my friend.<eos> And I do need a horseman of war, so...<eos> Forgive me, agent Thomas, but you're just... You're such a perfect fit for the job.<eos> Malcolm, when you first took me in, you were kind and you were generous.<eos> You taught me to stand up for myself, to fight for what I believe.<eos> There is so much potential in you.
Previously on Sleepy Hollow...<eos> He's immortal.<eos> Our enemy, Dreyfuss, seeks to raise the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.<eos> This is bad.<eos> Dreyfuss has the Horsemen in striking distance of the president.<eos> You and I... we are the Witnesses.
Very well.<eos> To the death.<eos> Ten paces.<eos> Turn.<eos> Fire at will.<eos> My money is on the warlock.<eos> Will this war between us never end, Henry?<eos> It ends... today.<eos> You tried to usurp me as the Horseman of War.<eos> Now that I have what is rightfully mine, I will be free of you.
Alex has been working on a way to surveil Dreyfuss's position.<eos> Right. We should make haste.<eos> You spent a lot of time here, huh?<eos> In the future you're from?<eos> Not my best days.<eos> We don't have to talk about it.<eos> - No, no. - I... I want to.<eos> You know Dreyfuss has a thing for artifacts.<eos> Yeah. He sent Jobe and I to raid this place, clear it of everything valuable.<eos> - You and Jobe? - Yeah.
Jobe was tasked as a sort of a guardian to me.<eos> Everything that I know about the supernatural I learned from him.<eos> Oh. And I feel bad leaving Molly with a nanny while I try to stop the Apocalypse.<eos> I'd like to meet Molly.<eos> When this is over.<eos> Just... tell her that she'll never have to live the life I did.<eos> When the time's right, of course. Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Oh, my God, you're staying.<eos> This is a one-way trip for you.

Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Oh, my God, you're staying.<eos> This is a one-way trip for you.<eos> You can't go back.<eos> Yeah, I-I... weigh that against saving you and giving Molly a chance at a life with you.
Okay, in the here and now, - Jobe and Dreyfuss are pretty tight.<eos> - I know him.<eos> Even if he doesn't know it yet.<eos> If I can contact him, tell him that he has more to lose than he can imagine.<eos> How do we begin such a conversation?<eos> The last of my spell crystals.<eos> Quasi per aquam.<eos> More Atlantean magic.<eos> I still owe you for the last time you used one of those, girl.<eos> We came to treat with you, demon.

- not been kind. - Honestly, I don't even know how we're gonna use these against the Horsemen.<eos> All right, stop it.<eos> When I first walked through these doors, this was Agency 355 by name only.<eos> But we have, every one of us, restored it to its former glory.<eos> So I ask you today, now... trust me.<eos> God's blood, trust each other.<eos> Because if Banneker bequeathed these armaments to the original heroes of our agency... then "age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn."<eos> And with these in our hands, I have no doubt, as one, we can only prevail.<eos> We've got Secret Service men in choppers,<eos> Rangers in the woods, and we've got you, my most glorious warrior.
If we move quickly, cut around their flank, we can still reach Dreyfuss before them.<eos> Lara took point. She'll let us know if we're heading into any trouble.<eos> Did the Secret Histories volume we found say anything about the weapons, how they work?<eos> It doesn't mean they won't, okay?<eos> Great. You could've lied to me, you know.<eos> It would've helped. When we first met Crane and Diana, we were pencil pushers.<eos> Now we're the front line.<eos> So if this is the end, at least we go out strong.<eos> That's a nice spin, I guess.<eos> I was never as blown away as you were to find out that the supernatural was real.
It was like, "Yeah, that makes sense."<eos> The bigger surprise, Jake, is that, for three years, I've been working with the one person in the world that I can't live without and I never saw it.<eos> Well, those are more words than I've heard you say about yourself, ever, to anyone.<eos> Now, uh, that's a good reason to stop the apocalypse.<eos> Damn straight.<eos> The Riders are headed this way!<eos> You need to keep the Horsemen at bay until Agent Thomas and I can take Dreyfuss out of the picture.<eos> It's do or die time.<eos> We have a chance...<eos> I have a chance because of you.
Damn straight.<eos> The Riders are headed this way!<eos> You need to keep the Horsemen at bay until Agent Thomas and I can take Dreyfuss out of the picture.<eos> It's do or die time.<eos> We have a chance...<eos> I have a chance because of you.<eos> Just please be careful.<eos> You might be from the future, but you're still my baby girl.<eos> You watch your six, Mom.<eos> You, too, old man.
My time in the Armor allows me to see him and to speak to him.<eos> Say your piece.<eos> Then make your peace.<eos> Different though we are, we share one thing in common:<eos> freedom.<eos> We both value freedom above all else.<eos> You're wrong, Father.<eos> My sole purpose is destruction and conflict.<eos> I thrive on it, live for it.<eos> War is a part of you, yes.
For a person to meet themselves...<eos> I-It could cause some sort of tear in the time-space continuum.<eos> Now, that, Miss Lara, sounds like a well-crafted excuse to avoid a difficult situation.<eos> Meeting my mother has been intense.<eos> Meeting myself?<eos> I don't know that I'm as ready as I thought I was.<eos> Besides, I'm a piece of what could have been.<eos> Molly deserves to have a future that is free and clear.<eos> And she can, now that she's no longer the Witness.<eos> So, since you arrived in this time, you and I alone share the bond.
Oh, there already are.<eos> Her lady doc just died.<eos> That was a secret.<eos> Why don't you just take her to my guy?<eos> Dr. Marsh.<eos> So hot.<eos> There's nothing like a sexy mechanic working under the hood.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Anyway, listen.<eos> Remember, you and Riley can't live without me.
Dr. Marsh.<eos> So hot.<eos> There's nothing like a sexy mechanic working under the hood.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Anyway, listen.<eos> Remember, you and Riley can't live without me.<eos> Mm? Danny!<eos> Just the person I was looking for.<eos> I need you to convince your mom to go away with me.<eos> You need to let her know that you and Riley will be perfectly fine here on your own.
I just walked in."<eos> Aw, man, it's the wrong Missed Connection.<eos> Now, what do I do?<eos> Go connect with that girl.<eos> She's hot.<eos> But she's not my girl.<eos> But she could be.<eos> Dude, she's obviously single.<eos> Right?<eos> And as desperate as you are.
He didn't know her name either.<eos> Die, die, die!<eos> Oh! "The do's and don'ts of diaper rash."<eos> - This is gonna be fascinating.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Ah, pretending to care.<eos> You're gonna be a great Dad.<eos> I just needed a little break from Riley.<eos> If only there was somebody around who's been through this before, you know, some kind of mother figure who could help.<eos> Right, a mother figure, like you.
But we definitely connected.<eos> I mean, I connected first, but then you did too, right?<eos> Sure.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's her!<eos> Her?<eos> Her who?<eos> Her.<eos> The girl, the girl I was just... thinking is not as hot as you.
Yeah, man, you might want to leave that part out when you finally meet her.<eos> Which I will be doing tonight because Amanda just invited me to a barbecue that "L" something will be at.<eos> Fate apparently has my back.<eos> And what's gonna happen when you see her?<eos> Oh, good question.<eos> I mean, a handshake seems super cold considering we are gonna be married one day and... probably move to Connecticut with our dog, Dude, Emma, and our three boys... Bennie, Benjamin, and Benzo.<eos> So I guess I'll go with a hug?<eos> Yeah, I meant what do you think Amanda is going to do since she invited you to be her date?<eos> Good point, Tuck.<eos> Back to you, Ben.
Aw, damn it.<eos> I forgot about Olivia.<eos> Olivia! I knew an Olivia once.<eos> Trapeze artist.<eos> She used to swing me from...<eos> Please don't tell your mother.<eos> Oh, this is perfect.<eos> Why don't you come and take care of Olivia if she becomes a problem.<eos> I love you, son.<eos> But I don't think I should kill for you.
Ah, here she is, my blushing bride.<eos> I swear, I'm the luckiest man alive.<eos> Aw! That is so sweet.<eos> I think I just met someone really special, too.<eos> Aw, sweetie.<eos> I just told you I have a wife.<eos> Look, I just started seeing someone.<eos> It's fine.<eos> No skin off my back.<eos> I didn't have to come over here and talk to you.
Oh, hey, Olivia.<eos> Amanda.<eos> I didn't realize, um...<eos> I'm just going to, um...<eos> I'm so thirsty. I see what's going on here.<eos> You do?<eos> Yeah. You're covering up for your dad.<eos> Bonnie, I swear. I didn't' get anyone pregnant.<eos> I did!<eos> Oh! Ow. You!
Amanda.<eos> I didn't realize, um...<eos> I'm just going to, um...<eos> I'm so thirsty. I see what's going on here.<eos> You do?<eos> Yeah. You're covering up for your dad.<eos> Bonnie, I swear. I didn't' get anyone pregnant.<eos> I did!<eos> Oh! Ow. You!<eos> I got you pregnant.
All right, I'll try the truth.<eos> Uh, look... I ran into this girl a few months ago.<eos> "L" something.<eos> Her name is Elle, you idiot.<eos> E-L-L-E.<eos> No way!<eos> Elle.<eos> That's perfect.<eos> Okay, fine. I'm a dog.<eos> I slept with you, and you, and I think her a long time ago.

I'm a dog.<eos> I slept with you, and you, and I think her a long time ago.<eos> But we had some fun, right?<eos> And it wasn't all my fault.<eos> I mean, you were a little desperate and you are very flirty.
All right, I'll see you soon.<eos> Love you, Mommy.<eos> Are we safe now?<eos> Thank you for the gift of this bread... To sustain these vessels our bodies, so that we may have the energy to create a more beautiful world, and break through the blocks and barriers of this life, and ascend The Ladder of Enlightenment.<eos> He's almost three weeks old, and he still doesn't have a name.<eos> Did you want to call him Steve?<eos> Well, um, definitely not my dad's name.<eos> Well, the right name will come.<eos> Whose last name will he have?<eos> Are you and Daddy back together again?
Well, can we find out?<eos> You don't think Eddie's with Sarah?<eos> You're good.<eos> Move it up.<eos> Wow. Check this out.<eos> It's so beautiful.<eos> Here.<eos> Hey, Summer, um, so, I have something to tell you.<eos> I just think that your...<eos> All right, so I put a message inside of this for you, and anytime you want to hear it, just put it up to your ear, and you will hear me.
Come on, man.<eos> I'm FBI.<eos> Well, she's not here.<eos> Just me.<eos> Now, you know I don't believe a word you're saying.<eos> Look, I don't know what to tell you,<eos> Sam.<eos> Abe but that's the truth.<eos> Well, I guess that's good luck for me, because I'm not here for Sarah.<eos> I'm here for you, Eddie.

I don't even know what to say anymore.<eos> What if she really did blackmail all those people?<eos> And... I mean, Cal is so protective of her, he just has everyone convinced that she's being persecuted.<eos> Wish I could divorce both my parents.<eos> You know what I've learned?<eos> You don't have to stick with the family you were born into.<eos> We can make a new one.<eos> And you have Cal, who loves you like a father.<eos> You have me, if you want me.<eos> I want you.

Wow, I... I don't know what to say.<eos> Um, you know, I'm humbled that you're all here.<eos> Look, the, thing is, I was told that I had to finish the climb before I... And now that seems impossible.<eos> You know, II've always been able to to see things.<eos> You know, visions.<eos> But I have no control over when or how I see them.<eos> Like, I don't know what happens next, Or how all of this is going to end.<eos> I guess why I'm telling you all this is because... like, I don't know if I'm "the one."<eos> I know Steve has asked me to lead, but I justyou know, I just I don't know.<eos> Eddie. Eddie, we're with you.
That he's the one who's supposed to build The Garden.<eos> And that he will make The Movement.<eos> And that he will make The Movement what we want it to be That's nonsense.<eos> People don't know what they want.<eos> I am one of the people, so I do kinda know.<eos> We want the Wizard to be real.<eos> We want to believe that the sad, angry boy can become the King.<eos> And that he will understand us, because he once was us.<eos> You talking about Eddie?<eos> I'm talking about you.

Stop right there.<eos> Pop the trunk, please.<eos> All right, next.<eos> Move it forward.<eos> Whoa, whoa. Right there.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> Where are you heading today?<eos> Yeah, copy that.<eos> Jim, we got this latemodel sedan.<eos> Coming over to you now.
Have a nice day now.<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> Hey.<eos> Um, hey, could you guys, just give is a minute Sure.<eos> Please?<eos> Planting a garden?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Broccoli, kale. Broccoli, kale<eos> Is it true?<eos> What Richard said about you?
Hey, Dad.<eos> Hey.<eos> Um, hey, could you guys, just give is a minute Sure.<eos> Please?<eos> Planting a garden?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Broccoli, kale. Broccoli, kale<eos> Is it true?<eos> What Richard said about you?<eos> What they're all saying about you?
What they're all saying about you?<eos> Steve asked me to guide The Movement.<eos> So, my mom's a criminal, and Cal's not the man I thought he was, and my dad is... magic?<eos> I'm not magic.<eos> Well, you're something.<eos> Look, I believe in magic. I floated.<eos> Okay, just...<eos> Just make me feel like the people inside your house feel.<eos> I wish I could.<eos> I'm asking you to help me believe in you.
I'm not magic.<eos> Well, you're something.<eos> Look, I believe in magic. I floated.<eos> Okay, just...<eos> Just make me feel like the people inside your house feel.<eos> I wish I could.<eos> I'm asking you to help me believe in you.<eos> It doesn't work that way.<eos> Why...<eos> Why were you and Cal with Libby DeKaan?
It doesn't work that way.<eos> Why...<eos> Why were you and Cal with Libby DeKaan?<eos> We got her to pay back the people your mother blackmailed, to get them to drop the charges.<eos> So...<eos> Nothing's gonna happen with the water tests?<eos> And Mom's not gonna... Go to jail.<eos> Why...<eos> I mean, after she and Cal, why why would you care about her like that?<eos> And why did Cal need you there to trade with Libby DeKaan?
Let's go.<eos> Sarah. Be a family.<eos> It's what you wanted.<eos> I mean, Canada? Anywhere.<eos> We were happy.<eos> We were almost happy, Eddie.<eos> - We could be happy. - Sarah<eos> Please.<eos> Sarah. Please don't go back inside.<eos> You will lose everything beautiful about you.
You are more than that.<eos> - You're a hero to me.<eos> - My quarters. Tonight.<eos> I'll give you something else to think about.<eos> - You can't date Amaya.<eos> - She has a destiny.<eos> And so do her descendents.<eos> Have either of you gentlemen heard of the Spear of Destiny?<eos> The Spear can alter reality itself.<eos> - Who's coming for you?
Okay, look, I know what you're gonna say...<eos> That you're a historian as well as a Legend.<eos> You know the consequences of returning Henry to the timeline.<eos> Yeah, my dad grows up with a father.<eos> Look, my childhood was miserable.<eos> My dad was a cold, disconnected jackass.<eos> But maybe, just maybe, returning Henry to that time could change everything.<eos> This is my chance to fix three generations of Heywood men.<eos> You don't need fixing.<eos> Your childhood made you into the man that you are, the person that you are today.
We'll be over Ray's launch position in 18 minutes.<eos> We only get one chance at this intercept before the moon's gravity slingshots us back to Earth.<eos> Henry.<eos> You need to understand how time travel works.<eos> My grandfather understands it just fine.<eos> You can't return to 1956.<eos> - Amaya.<eos> - Why?<eos> Every time we change history, we create what we call an Aberration.<eos> Now, if your son grows up with you around, he could become an entirely different person, choose a different life.
- Why?<eos> Every time we change history, we create what we call an Aberration.<eos> Now, if your son grows up with you around, he could become an entirely different person, choose a different life.<eos> That, in turn, could change Nathaniel and the person he becomes.<eos> If he's even born at all.<eos> She doesn't know that.<eos> But it's a possibility?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Because my dad needs you.
He was gone before I knew him.<eos> I'm sure he was sorry he left.<eos> My dad wasn't really there for me either.<eos> But I knew he loved me.<eos> He just, um... just couldn't show me.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> No.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> But if you can accept that, you'll be a better man for it.<eos> You and your son.
I respected the hell out of that guy.<eos> Now you're just their trained pet.<eos> Sit, Mick.<eos> Fetch, Mick.<eos> Good boy, Mick. Woof!<eos> I'm no one's... pet.<eos> Sure you are.<eos> They may act all friendly to you, but they'll never trust you, never.<eos> When the chips are down, they'll look at you the same way they always have: as a thug.<eos> But you and me?
Angriff!<eos> Get behind me!<eos> What is this madness?<eos> Aah! What are you?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We gotta go!<eos> Not without the engraving!<eos> You actually care about these losers.<eos> Mick, come on, let's go!<eos> Because I guarantee they don't care about you, Mick.
Jefferson.<eos> How are things down at the lab?<eos> There was a minor setback, but the situation is under control.<eos> You promised me results.<eos> And you will have them.<eos> I just need to motivate my employee a little more.<eos> But another test will be up and running this evening.<eos> I hope so, for his sake... and yours.<eos> Yes.<eos> I don't know why you and Damien insist on toying with the Legends.
You saved my life. Why?<eos> Because I'm an idiot.<eos> This could be one of my scars talking, but I'm sensing you're telling me the truth.<eos> Let's move.<eos> This is crazier than any of my crazy theories.<eos> You're trying to tell me a group called "The Legion of Doom"<eos> you something called it "Spearing of Destiny"<eos> to rewrite reality?<eos> Who even names something "Legion of Doom"?<eos> You did.
Yes, boss?<eos> Mick Rory's got himself lost.<eos> Find him, would you?<eos> Where do you suggest we start our search?<eos> You can track him with this.<eos> I put a GPS in Mick.<eos> I don't trust anyone.<eos> Okay, on the count of three.<eos> One... two...<eos> You!
The Spear took away your powers.<eos> But it's true.<eos> Nate used to be able to steel up, and I had a robotic exoskeleton that allowed me to shrink.<eos> These guys are heroes.<eos> That is so great.<eos> We kill heroes.<eos> One more person hits me, I'm gonna punch back.<eos> What the hell happened to me?<eos> It appears that after the Legion got the Spear and changed reality, they kept us around as their pets.<eos> Yeah, except for you.
Rum.<eos> And speaking of which, I'm gonna need you to fabricate me another bottle of it.<eos> Ooh, and some nachos.<eos> I will do nothing of the sort.<eos> What?<eos> You will do as I tell you, Gideon, I'm your captain!<eos> Then it's time for you to start acting like one.<eos> Now, sit up straight and show your backbone, Captain Hunter.<eos> Gideon, for the thousandth time, I've got no way of getting the reserve power back online, and I've got no way of... Of sending out any signal of any sort, which means...<eos> Which means that I am destined to live out the rest of my days right... here... with you.
As you can see, the machine appears to be fully functional, though it may take some time for the core to reach peak temperature.<eos> Well, then you'll stay until it does.<eos> I-I was hoping to see my family tonight.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no, you can't leave in your moment of glory.<eos> You keep monitoring the core and make sure the reaction remains stable.<eos> Think we got something.<eos> We pieced together a passage from the "Kalabros."<eos> AKA the word of God.<eos> All right, Jax, it's on you to restore Stein's mind before we get to the lab.
- Now, remember, you guys are going in there without your powers.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I know that place like the back of my hand.<eos> What about Mick?<eos> Mick's staying here.<eos> We can't trust him.<eos> Not after what you've done.<eos> After what I've done?<eos> If it wasn't for me, you'd all be walking around like sheep.<eos> If it wasn't for you, we never would have been turned into sheep in the first place.
Nice work, Mick.<eos> Now hand it over.<eos> Mick, no.<eos> You already gave it to him once.<eos> You know what happened.<eos> That was Thawne.<eos> This time will be different, big boy.<eos> Don't do this, Mick.<eos> Mick, I don't care what anyone else thinks.<eos> I still believe in you.
No, no, quite the opposite.<eos> But because it is so... delicious, knowing that you'll be forced to live your lives in a reality that I... Well, that we created.<eos> You will walk this world knowing that something isn't quite right, that for all your trying you only made things worse, and no one will ever believe you when you tell them about all the sacrifices you made and how close you came to being Legends.<eos> Now, that sounds like a fitting punishment to me.<eos> What do you think, Professor Stein?<eos> I don't care what you do to them, as long as I never have to see Mr. Jackson again.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> You're just gonna let them walk?<eos> Be glad I'm letting you and your fellow traitors do the same.
It will once I get better at drawing ears!<eos> Look, I signed up yesterday, and I've been raking in cash.<eos> And leaves!<eos> It's all going in my college fund.<eos> Give me that.<eos> Moving things?<eos> Standing in line?<eos> Delivering food without eating it?<eos> Are these people Crank Yankers?<eos> Ooh, here's one you'll like.
It's so bad, I can't accomplish any of my goals.<eos> I haven't been able to stop anything.<eos> The whole board is against me.<eos> I know it sounds paranoid, but-<eos> - Who said that?<eos> You should get TaskRabbit on your phone.<eos> That way, you can hire me, and I can do politics for you.<eos> Mm-mm, I'm not into the whole "sharing economy."<eos> If a stranger comes into my home and wants to go through my stuff, what right do I have to know who they are?<eos> So, how about instead, anytime I need you, I just call, and you do it for free?
[Xan] I don't understand this place.<eos> Like, in high school, being rich was cool.<eos> But here I'm like you.<eos> 'Sup, Your Majesty?<eos> Just polishing my crown.<eos> -Who's your friend?<eos> Her?<eos> She's not my friend.<eos> [Jersey accent] Yeah, I'm a-- I'm Tony Ravioli, youse tax rabbit!<eos> Okay, Tony, why don't you do less talking and focus on your job?
An overwhelming amount of evidence suggests that there's a high probability that our reality is just a simulation.<eos> We are all merely avatars being controlled by other creatures.<eos> Sorry, Doug. It appears our time has come to an end.<eos> But it was great meeting you, and I will be in touch.<eos> The hell was that all about?<eos> I'm interviewing potential roommates.<eos> When I agreed to take over Max's lease I didn't realize how expensive it was.<eos> You know, M.E.'s make a lot more than special consultants.<eos> Well, there's that whole medical school thing, Jerry.<eos> Anyway, I need you to look into this Turner robbery.
Okay, Daniel, if I could read your mind...<eos> Daniel... If you could read my mind, you would know that I was thinking that Lou was right.<eos> We should've just rushed in there this morning, and the Feds wouldn't be doing our job for us.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> We needed to show them respect for their land.<eos> It was the only way we could avoid people getting hurt.<eos> I don't know, I don't know.<eos> It seems to me now a lot more people are gonna get hurt and it's all over a fugitive.<eos> And Bumpy and his, group, they are the same people that took over the palace a couple of years ago.<eos> Anybody else you would label as stone-cold criminals.
I just want to talk to him.<eos> Let him know that he's got my full support.<eos> He needs to know that he's got friends on the outside.<eos> Me, my brother... We'll make sure he gets a fair shake.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Yeah, I need to be connected to the U.S. marshal's outpost immediately, please.<eos> Yeah, I'll hold.<eos> Here's what I don't get.<eos> When we got Kanuha on those robberies, why didn't he give us Devon Berris then?<eos> Because, just like you and Kono said, the guy's been under this other guy's thumb.
We're currently on the way to question a new suspect,<eos> Devon Berris.<eos> Berris?<eos> We just let him inside to see Kanuha.<eos> What?<eos> He's there now?<eos> Yeah, he showed up two minutes ago.<eos> What have you told them?<eos> I barely told them anything.<eos> And nothing about you.
What?<eos> He's there now?<eos> Yeah, he showed up two minutes ago.<eos> What have you told them?<eos> I barely told them anything.<eos> And nothing about you.<eos> Good.<eos> Let's keep it that way.<eos> But they still think I killed Akemoto.<eos> Except we both know it was you, wasn't it?
You're gonna tell them that Akemoto approached you after you got out, talked you into doing those robberies.<eos> They'll believe that.<eos> I mean, it was his equipment that you used, right?<eos> Then you'll say that you tried to walk away, but Akemoto wouldn't let you.<eos> There was a struggle.<eos> You grabbed the gun in self-defense.<eos> I'll talk to my brother.<eos> Get him involved.<eos> You can plead down.<eos> He'll take care of you on the inside.
He'll take care of you on the inside.<eos> Line up a early release for, good behavior.<eos> Are you listening to me?<eos> He came to you?<eos> What?<eos> Akemoto wanted you to let me go, didn't he?<eos> He was trying to help me.<eos> He felt guilty for what happened all those years ago.<eos> And he was trying to make it right.<eos> You think Akemoto cared about you?
A cop?<eos> It's my boss, Kim.<eos> God, I hate her.<eos> Hello, Kimberly.<eos> You sound like your skin looks amazing.<eos> All right, Reagan, you can get to reading.<eos> We can stick around if you want us to.<eos> - I don't think it's necessary.<eos> - You need us?<eos> - We'll stick around for you.
Uh... oh, no.<eos> - What did she advise?<eos> - She didn't... it just wasn't...<eos> - What did she advise?<eos> - It didn't...<eos> Come on, what did she advise?<eos> - She advised that I sue!<eos> - I knew it!<eos> Who?<eos> You.
I need to learn how to manage my clients on my own.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, man, that was intense.<eos> Uh, also, Schmidt, I printed something... do you know where it went?<eos> - Not now.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Okay, it's voice mail.<eos> Donovan...<eos> I know that you don't want to be tied down, okay?<eos> But that's why being a model is... perfect for you.
- Not now.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Okay, it's voice mail.<eos> Donovan...<eos> I know that you don't want to be tied down, okay?<eos> But that's why being a model is... perfect for you.<eos> Because if you're a cop, then you're just gonna be a cop.<eos> But if you're a model, then you can be everyone.<eos> You can be an ice cream man, a rocketeer, a jewel thief, or an underwear guy in a 10 million dollar loft whose only furniture is a telescope.<eos> So, help me... help you... become the everyone that you can be!
I could hear everything.<eos> God, why are tiny rakes so soothing?<eos> You know, I think I'm finally starting to understand momentum.<eos> Which, apparently, my book does not have.<eos> Nick, everyone loves it.<eos> Robby wrote fan fiction for it.<eos> - He wrote fan fiction? - Yeah.<eos> - That means the world to me.<eos> - He loves it so much.<eos> Don't take this the wrong way about Robby, but... he is way too good for you.
Robby wrote fan fiction for it.<eos> - He wrote fan fiction? - Yeah.<eos> - That means the world to me.<eos> - He loves it so much.<eos> Don't take this the wrong way about Robby, but... he is way too good for you.<eos> He's way too good for everybody.<eos> I know.<eos> What is wrong with me?<eos> Any insight, ex to ex?<eos> Of what's wrong with you?
Of what's wrong with you?<eos> Oh, this feels like a trap.<eos> Well, you know, maybe when things are going good, you get scared and you look for reasons to doubt it.<eos> Is that what happened with us?<eos> I mean, I can't begin to understand what happened with us, but maybe.<eos> So, what are you gonna do about Reagan?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Her opinion means a lot to me, so...<eos> Well, I think that's good you're letting yourself be vulnerable.<eos> Was I not that with you?
- Is that new?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I just went to the mall;<eos> I did a little retail therapy.<eos> Look, I'm really sorry about today.<eos> I shouldn't be looking for things to go wrong.<eos> It's just... a thing that I do.<eos> I'm sorry, too.<eos> I mean, sometimes I act more like a... superfan than a boyfriend.<eos> And I don't want to do that with you.
What's wrong with the house again?<eos> Well, I'm just worried about this one room.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - It feels like it's becoming... your home office.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I can't believe that you did this!<eos> It's...<eos> It's so amazing.<eos> - Look at that.<eos> EstroFuel.<eos> - And a... framed, shirtless picture of you.
She was here to help you. Shh!<eos> She might still be out there listening.<eos> Don't ever let her come back in here again, please.<eos> Promise me.<eos> I will promise you that, because she is never coming back!<eos> She walked out!<eos> Good.<eos> Because we can only trust each other now.<eos> Nobody else.<eos> Just you and me.
Helen, on the other hand, ticks every box on the wholesome soccer mom checklist.<eos> President of her PTA, super active at church, heavily involved in charity work.<eos> Spence, have you looked at the ink markings yet?<eos> I did.<eos> Whatever it is, it doesn't come from traditional sources of art, mythology, and literature.<eos> Except for the incomplete base of a triangle, the design is evocative of the pagan symbol for earth.<eos> Garcia, look into other questionable suicides and accidental deaths in the Tampa area recently.<eos> Searching the sad stuff.<eos> On it.<eos> Rossi, when we land, you and Lewis check in with the M.E.
Stay away from me!<eos> Aah! Leave me alone!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Give it to me!<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> For God's sake, leave me alone!<eos> Mom!<eos> No! Stop! Why did you do that?<eos> Why? ! I hate that stuff!<eos> And I hate you!
When you were a little boy, I took you to the circus, and after that, all you could talk about is you wanted to be a tightrope walker when you grew up.<eos> I thought I wanted to be a magician.<eos> You did.<eos> That was later. This was first.<eos> Really?<eos> I don't remember that at all.<eos> Oh, no wonder.<eos> You were no more than 3 or 4.<eos> What's on its head?<eos> It's you!
Actually, we are from the FBI.<eos> What's FBI? Whoa!<eos> That is a cool doll.<eos> What's her name?<eos> Sally.<eos> She has the same hair as you.<eos> Do you mind if my colleague Dr. Reid takes Madison to get a snack and we can chat for a few minutes?<eos> Maddie, you be a good girl and you get something nice and you come right back, ok?<eos> Yes, Mommy.<eos> After you.
You have to stop doing that.<eos> I'll try.<eos> Really. I'll get help.<eos> The police still have no suspects as the mutilated body count and fear rise in the community.<eos> Authorities would not go into detail, however, they did confirm that this is the second mutilated corpse Discovered in the street...<eos> You ok?<eos> Not really.<eos> Hi.<eos> Babe. I love you.<eos> I'd do anything for you.
If they just separated, it would still enrage the unsub, and it could have led to this.<eos> I told you that when you got engaged.<eos> You don't know who a man is until you have your first big fight. I know.<eos> But every time I think I'm finally over him, he does something sweet, and I'm right back in his arms.<eos> So he has some redeeming qualities?<eos> No one's 100% good or evil.<eos> Except maybe the psycho who killed Dale.<eos> I still can't believe he's gone.<eos> I should go.<eos> It was good to finally spend time with you again.
Just called an Uber.<eos> She'll be here in two minutes.<eos> Be safe.<eos> You too.<eos> Hey, Wes.<eos> Mark.<eos> Have you seen Bill?<eos> I don't want to talk to you.<eos> I know I've been a terrible friend.<eos> Cutting Bill off from you was wrong.
You brought this on yourself.<eos> We don't even know who was killed.<eos> It's terrible.<eos> Can't get much more public than this.<eos> Can't get any angrier than this either.<eos> No question this is meant to shock and terrorize the gay community.<eos> But he keeps coming back to the same area despite increased patrols here.<eos> To justify that risk, he must have a very personal target in mind.<eos> Someone who's connected to this neighborhood and this victim, and that's why he deviated from his preferred physical type.<eos> These murders, they made me realize how awful I was to you.
31 years old.<eos> Did 3 tours in Afghanistan.<eos> Super secret security clearance.<eos> And he was an army Intelligence officer.<eos> I'm sending pic and bio now.<eos> Moved here 18 months ago.<eos> No relatives in the area.<eos> No, but his partner, Nick Goode, works out of town, comes home on the weekends.<eos> He will be landing at Palm Springs International Airport in 30 minutes.<eos> Dave, you and Stephen bring him in for an interview.
No matter how frightened Bill was, he knew Mark wouldn't change.<eos> That's why Mark escalated to overkill and started displaying bodies in more public ways.<eos> The more indecisive Bill was about getting back together, the more Mark tried to force him back home with fear.<eos> They started out as rage kills but evolved into a more extreme form of coercive control.<eos> A final rejection highly increases the risk of death to the partner in cases like this.<eos> Let me go!<eos> You should have thought of that before you rubbed up on Wesley.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I never cheated.<eos> You killed him.
I really thought that bringing her home with me was the best plan, but I don't know. I feel like now I... I made a mistake.<eos> It's not really working.<eos> People and circumstances change unexpectedly.<eos> We need to learn how to adapt and regroup and go on.<eos> I might need to take a few days. I'm gonna fly to Houston and talk to Dr. Stanfield.<eos> Sure.<eos> Take as much time as you need.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Spencer.<eos> I couldn't be more proud of you.
Mom, don't do that!<eos> Don't do that! Stop it!<eos> Leave me alone! Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> Give it back to me!<eos> Oh! Stay away from me!<eos> Aah! For God's sake, leave me alone!<eos> Mom! Stop!<eos> Why did you do that?<eos> I hate that stuff and I hate you!
It's ok.<eos> We know you didn't do anything wrong.<eos> But I should have told you guys I was going there.<eos> I never... never imagined in a million years it would have turned out like this.<eos> No one thought that this could have happened.<eos> Look, you're not in this alone anymore.<eos> No secrets.<eos> Deal.<eos> My turn.<eos> Come here, you.
Please stop.<eos> - Richard, what're you doing? - What? What?<eos> What do you mean? I'm complaining about Dinesh. He...<eos> He sucks.<eos> He's my boss now, Richard.<eos> Well, your boss is being a real prick.<eos> Richard, we have to bifurcate our relationship.<eos> You and I can no longer discuss business. All right?<eos> We can... We can talk about anything else two guys might talk about.<eos> We can talk about sports teams and their scores, or pussy, but... but you and I cannot and will not discuss business.
There he is.<eos> Is that our lawyer? - Hey!<eos> - I thought he was in jail.<eos> Perfect timing.<eos> I just completed the detailing on this Kia.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - What the fuck is going on?<eos> I don't understand. How did Richard have access to our user data?<eos> Someone must've let him in.<eos> It was you.
And in case all of you gents have forgotten, I'm on the hook for half a million clambos for this thing.<eos> But we can't stay online! We're just racking up more fines!<eos> Well, technically, this is a corporation.<eos> So whatever they fine you, they'll really only be able to collect what the company's worth, which at this point, is basically nothing.<eos> That's right.<eos> I'm just the CEO. I'm not personally liable.<eos> Although...<eos> Although what?<eos> Well, when you lied to me about adding terms of service, it could be argued you violated your fiduciary duty to the company, rendering you personally liable.<eos> I mean, if the FTC brought us to trial, I could be compelled to testify against you.
for free for six months.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> One year.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Fine.<eos> - It's a deal.<eos> Jian, I mean, your onerous terms not withstanding, I'm very excited to be a part of your VR play.<eos> - VR, virtual reality.<eos> - Who's doing VR?<eos> You are.
Yeah, I will.<eos> All right, I'm, uh... I'm gonna leave you guys to it.<eos> Oh, Erlich didn't get a call from Ed Chen today, did he?<eos> I heard them on speakerphone, 'cause Erlich was neti-potting. I think, uh...<eos> I think they're meeting tonight.<eos> Good to know.<eos> - What?<eos> - Sesame seeds.<eos> - To SeeFood.<eos> - To SeeFood... and to a full-expensed meal on Raviga's tab, and to you, Ed Chen, who pulled the wool over Laurie Bream's eyes and got us two-hundo-thou sight unseen.

I mean, look at this drawing.<eos> I drew the exact same thing on my doctor's butt paper.<eos> I mean, Peter had the exact same idea.<eos> He was just waiting for compression to catch up, which it did, thanks to me.<eos> Cheer up, Richard.<eos> Yes, but here's the best part, okay?<eos> Peter never foresaw the ubiquity of Internet connected computing devices. Right?<eos> Camera, refrigerators, TVs, baby monitors, not to mention the billions-plus smartphones that are floating around the world.<eos> I mean, who here has a smartphone, right?<eos> You, you, me, Jian-Yang, Dinesh, Monica...
She should never have been there. I am aware of that.<eos> You say she insisted, begged.<eos> You're so enthralled by your bride that you could not deny her.<eos> And make myself appear weak?<eos> It is a choice, Lord, between appearing love-sick, or foolish.<eos> Uhtred?<eos> Uhtred, where are you going?<eos> I'm going home to Coccham, where Alfred has asked me to remain!<eos> And where I left my wife.<eos> But the King, he may need you.
"has been left alive in the city."<eos> You began so well.<eos> I will be reminding the King who it was who travelled into Daneland.<eos> I will be reminding the King that your friend Uhtred has been called King of Mercia, and I shall remind him how fond you are of his seat.<eos> Do that.<eos> But allow me to remind you of this-the only man capable of cleaning up this puddle of shit is the man you are desperate to blame.<eos> Uhtred King of Mercia.<eos> What is on your mind?<eos> I am thinking of Aethelflaed.<eos> If she lives, you will be her hope.

There will be a heathen sacrifice the youngest member of the visiting party will be split with an axe.<eos> They will want to humiliate us.<eos> In what way?<eos> An insult, a challenge.<eos> Why Because they can.<eos> Haesten.<eos> We're travelling to Beamfleot.<eos> For Alfred?<eos> For Alfred, yes.<eos> I am here to take you on to the fortress, Lord. You and two others.
Oh, she's not his favourite.<eos> Why else would he have allowed her to marry the pig's arse standing behind me?<eos> Before any negotiations take place, the pig's arse wishes to be certain that his wife is well.<eos> And if she's not well? What then?<eos> What will the pig's arse do?<eos> Fart?<eos> Will you fight me?<eos> Will you fight my brother?<eos> I would like that.<eos> You alone will kneel.
I'm not shooting him.<eos> The people I joined up with here today have been tracking secret acts across the globe not sanctioned by our government for the past eight months.<eos> The people on trial out there perpetrated those acts, working far outside the law.<eos> The Islamic Front is nothing compared to these people.<eos> If you could go back and stop ISIS before they formed, wouldn't you?<eos> That's 20-20 hindsight.<eos> There is no way to go back.<eos> We have 20-20 foresight.<eos> The AIC are planning something big, and I want to help stop them.<eos> I've calculated the risks, the rewards, the possible benefits to mankind, and I'm on the right side of this, are you?
This is Marcus Weber.<eos> Marcus works in IT at the German telecom company<eos> DeutcheCom.<eos> In addition, he's one of the CIA's best assets in Munich.<eos> Two days ago, he was brought in by the Bundespolizei for questioning.<eos> They believe he hacked into his own company's phone records, but they don't know it was for us.<eos> German intelligence can't prove anything yet, which is why he's under surveillance round the clock.<eos> So the CIA is gonna exfiltrate him from Germany before they make the connection?<eos> Not the CIA.<eos> You.
And Marcus...<eos> Anyone else want to send Marcus to a German prison?<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> So we make the approach after we distract his cover team and get away quickly.<eos> Very good.<eos> And then what?<eos> We bring him to the rendezvous point, lay low, move him early in the morning when German intelligence thinks he's asleep.<eos> Nice try.<eos> But while Marcus might have been asleep, German intelligence was not.<eos> They spotted you... and caught up with you.
People are gonna wonder why I'm here...<eos> Federal police, foreign operatives, anyone with a personal vendetta.<eos> Hang on, Owen.<eos> You're putting yourself in harm's way.<eos> Why?<eos> Because when you exfiltrate someone, your target is in real danger.<eos> And now so am I, so you better act fast and come up with a plan to get me out by the end of the day.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Is this about what I showed you earlier?<eos> Sorry, Alex, but for once, this isn't about you.
Is this about what I showed you earlier?<eos> Sorry, Alex, but for once, this isn't about you.<eos> Just get to work.<eos> Well, we've got our work cut out for us, but before we can even think about getting Owen out of the country, we need to find a safe place to stow him.<eos> He's a sitting duck out here.<eos> Was, Booth.<eos> Where'd he go?<eos> You can't exfiltrate someone you can't find.<eos> So, who's gonna get to me first?<eos> You or them?
Why don't you two go and get Owen's IDs while we work on finding him?<eos> How?<eos> He doesn't want to be found.<eos> Yes, he does.<eos> Marcus Weber is Owen Hall.<eos> We use the pattern of life that we established for Marcus.<eos> We split up, we find him, we meet at the rendezvous point a few clicks outside of the border.<eos> I'll go with Alex.<eos> I-I'll be fine by myself.<eos> Yeah, but I'm better with you.
The police are probably already on their way.<eos> Who do you work for?<eos> Owen Hall, CIA, or the real CIA that we spilled blood for together?<eos> Are you coming?<eos> Tell me, Alex... how's it supposed to end for me?<eos> They tell me my career meant nothing, and then you tell me, on top of that, my daughter, Lydia, is lost to me, too?<eos> Every relationship I've sacrificed, they've all ended the same.<eos> So...<eos> I'm leaving it to fate.<eos> If I'm meant to go down here, hey, so be it, and if not, you and the other recruits will save me.
You think you deserve this.<eos> Lydia's not your mistake.<eos> The AIC is not your mistake.<eos> In fact, it's your chance to make sure that your career means something again.<eos> Buy it all back, and we'll do it together.<eos> We'll make sure that we bring Lydia back to our side, but I can't do that if you wind up in jail.<eos> They don't look like the federal police.<eos> Nope.<eos> All right, out the back.<eos> You first.
Were you aware of an operation in Laos December of last year?<eos> You're gonna have to be a bit more specific.<eos> Laos.<eos> December.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> You don't want to shoot me.<eos> Laos.<eos> December.<eos> You're hoping I answer this high-stakes "Jeopardy!" question correctly, and you'll be spared the guilt of killing someone innocent.<eos> Well, not innocent, but not you.
Are you happy, Sebastian?<eos> You think I'm not happy because I'm not honest about who I am, but I know what I am.<eos> Weak.<eos> I let you into my head.<eos> I let you tell me who I was.<eos> And that's why I...<eos> Kissed me?<eos> Yeah, what do you think of me, Sebastian?<eos> Let's just drop the act.<eos> Just be who you are.
I let you into my head.<eos> I let you tell me who I was.<eos> And that's why I...<eos> Kissed me?<eos> Yeah, what do you think of me, Sebastian?<eos> Let's just drop the act.<eos> Just be who you are.<eos> What do...<eos> What do you actually think of me?<eos> I don't condemn people like you.
Okay, if you actually believe this, how is this okay?<eos> This.<eos> H-How...<eos> How can I be your friend?<eos> Well, once I met Carly, I realized what you are.<eos> You're here to tempt me.<eos> And I will not give in.<eos> B...<eos> Well, if you think I'm...<eos> Think I'm so wrong, how can I be friends with you?
You're here to tempt me.<eos> And I will not give in.<eos> B...<eos> Well, if you think I'm...<eos> Think I'm so wrong, how can I be friends with you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> One more for the road?<eos> Hefeweizen. Change of plans.<eos> We got to hit my hotel first.<eos> Why, did you leave some little soaps behind?
Gunned down on her way home from work?<eos> Who deserves that?<eos> After everything you've been through, you should be stronger than this.<eos> And after everything you've been through, you should know better.<eos> This...<eos> This is a person.<eos> I don't know who she is.<eos> I don't know what she did...<eos> Exactly.<eos> You don't.
They do.<eos> If you don't trust the CIA, then you don't deserve to be here.<eos> I'll do this myself.<eos> How long is this gonna take, anyway?<eos> Not long at all.<eos> Owen Hall.<eos> You probably don't recognize me, but I recognize you.<eos> Daniel Sharp.<eos> I was only 14 when they murdered my mother right in front to me.<eos> Because of you.
Owen Hall.<eos> You probably don't recognize me, but I recognize you.<eos> Daniel Sharp.<eos> I was only 14 when they murdered my mother right in front to me.<eos> Because of you.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> There are a lot of things I don't have to do anymore.<eos> I choose to do this.<eos> Any time now.<eos> Why is it so important to you?
Any time now.<eos> Why is it so important to you?<eos> Did Lydia tell you to ask me all these questions to test my loyalty?<eos> This isn't a test.<eos> We're about to kill someone.<eos> You killed someone.<eos> I cleaned up the blood, remember?<eos> You were okay taking orders then.<eos> I see him over and over again.<eos> Don't you?
You killed someone.<eos> I cleaned up the blood, remember?<eos> You were okay taking orders then.<eos> I see him over and over again.<eos> Don't you?<eos> Here she comes.<eos> Get ready.<eos> I knew my mother had secrets.<eos> But I just didn't know what they were, not until I was older.<eos> Went looking and found out she spied for you.
Get ready.<eos> I knew my mother had secrets.<eos> But I just didn't know what they were, not until I was older.<eos> Went looking and found out she spied for you.<eos> But why?<eos> It wasn't for money.<eos> We were broke when she died!<eos> She believed in what we were doing, Daniel.<eos> No!<eos> She believed in you.
But I just didn't know what they were, not until I was older.<eos> Went looking and found out she spied for you.<eos> But why?<eos> It wasn't for money.<eos> We were broke when she died!<eos> She believed in what we were doing, Daniel.<eos> No!<eos> She believed in you.<eos> She trusted you.<eos> She died because of you.
Which is why we need to get everyone out of this building now.<eos> I'll send a message to the other terrorists that the interrogations have concluded.<eos> Then I can jam the remotes for the collars so everyone can move outside freely.<eos> And I'll go and get Raina 'cause I promised Nimah I would.<eos> And we get everyone downstairs and out.<eos> You can't move around in civilian clothes.<eos> There's tactical gear in there.<eos> No one else dies today.<eos> Don't you ever make choices like that for me again.<eos> If you're not up to the task, then walk away, but don't drag me down with you.

I don't want to die.<eos> You want to get her attention?<eos> She didn't show up, Owen.<eos> She was probably there, too, 'cause Ryan and the others had a mission.<eos> She's not your daughter anymore.<eos> She's a criminal that you have to catch.<eos> And when you do she could be your daughter again.<eos> But if you really don't want to die, if you really want to get through this, you have to stop lying to me, to them, to yourself.<eos> It wasn't all lies.<eos> I did have something for you at the hotel.
But if you really don't want to die, if you really want to get through this, you have to stop lying to me, to them, to yourself.<eos> It wasn't all lies.<eos> I did have something for you at the hotel.<eos> I hacked Lydia's e-mails.<eos> Those are her communications with recruits at the Farm, past and present.<eos> SDRs, test aliases, recruiting assets.<eos> This is your curriculum.<eos> They're encrypted.<eos> It's a code very few people would recognize.<eos> But you do.
What?<eos> Why?<eos> You're not my friend, Sebastian.<eos> You don't accept me.<eos> You literally pray for me to change who I am.<eos> I just didn't believe it.<eos> I just thought you were spouting and repeating something you've been told.<eos> But, uh... no.<eos> Y-You do believe it.<eos> You feel it. It's in you.
This isn't the best timing. I know that.<eos> Well, typical me.<eos> Maybe it's because...<eos> 'Oxygen levels critical.'<eos> ..everything's so... messed up.<eos> The trivial stuff just... falls away.<eos> You realise life... can be so brief... ..and so, I just want to tell you...<eos> ..if we do get through this...<eos> I want to have a baby!<eos> With you!
- The truth.<eos> - Don't be unreasonable.<eos> 'Space! '<eos> Going to space is exactly like camping.<eos> - Is it?<eos> - Uh, well. No.<eos> Ok.<eos> - In a way, yes.<eos> - Great!<eos> Too much between you and the outside and you might as well stay home.
Opening the airlock was only the station's plan A.<eos> Plan B: filtering out all the oxygen.<eos> So, they can sell it back to us?<eos> Capitalism in space.<eos> If we want to keep breathing, we have exactly one option.<eos> Buy the merchandise.<eos> 'Oxygen levels are seriously depleted.<eos> 'Please step on board your Ganymede Systems Series 12 SmartSuit.<eos> 'Engage pressure pad to activate customised robing.'<eos> You said those things were going to kill us!
You couldn't have saved her!<eos> You know what's wrong with this universe, believe me, I've looked into it...<eos> Everyone says... ..it's not their fault.<eos> Well, yes, it is.<eos> All of it.<eos> It's ALL your fault.<eos> - So, what are you going to do about it?<eos> - There's nothing we can do!<eos> She's... dead.<eos> She's no more dead than you are.
No.<eos> Not ever.<eos> Only women.<eos> Oh!<eos> All right. Yeah, I got it.<eos> You're like Vitus, then.<eos> What?<eos> He only likes men.<eos> Some men.<eos> Better looking men than you, Lucius.
No.<eos> He understands.<eos> Don't you?<eos> And now he's wondering why.<eos> You speak Latin?<eos> I don't!<eos> Neither do I. Not a word.<eos> And I don't speak whatever they speak either.<eos> It's him.<eos> It's you, isn't it?
This is worse than jazz.<eos> Nothing, there's nothing.<eos> Maybe it won't come.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Hello.<eos> Doctor!<eos> No, no.<eos> Nardole.<eos> It's probably a bit tricky for you, that, innit?
No, no, no.<eos> It's fine.<eos> She's supposed to be in the vault.<eos> How were the engines?<eos> Better than you deserve.<eos> You are naughty.<eos> Do you ever do basic maintenance?<eos> No, but I've got a plan for that.<eos> What?<eos> You.
[both moaning] -Is that how straight people kiss?<eos> -Is that how gay people kiss?<eos> This is getting out of hand.<eos> We got to shut it down.<eos> I'm calling the White Widow.<eos> Uh-huh, uh-huh. I overstand.<eos> Uh, put on a Holocaust movie till I get there.<eos> [Perry] Everyone please stay seated, and, white passengers, for the last time, please do not touch my hair.<eos> -[Perry] Kimmy!<eos> I was worried about you.
That it does.<eos> Look, Scott, I'm gonna have to close the E.R.<eos> More people uninsured than ever, higher costs.<eos> The numbers just don't add up.<eos> This community here, all of these people, they're not just numbers.<eos> Save me the bleeding heart speech.<eos> I grew up in circumstances where access to medicine was a swig of Robitussin.<eos> I understand what's at stake, but this E.R. could take down the entire hospital.<eos> Okay, so what's the plan?<eos> All right, SAM gets transformed into a specialty surgery center with you at the helm.
Back off, you devils! Aah!<eos> - Man: Watch it!<eos> - Hey, let's go!<eos> Get out of my head! Aah!<eos> Welcome to the night shift.<eos> Think you're gonna fit right in.<eos> I'm not trying to salt your game.<eos> Now are you sure this is cool with Shannon?<eos> I-I, uh, it will be.<eos> You're actually helping me out by splitting the utilities and the rent, now that I'm as broke as you.
These facilities are for employees only.<eos> What's your name?<eos> This man held you captive and now you treat him?<eos> He's jihadist scum who deserves to die.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But right now, he's my only chance of finding Syd.<eos> Okay. Your kneecap's dislocated.<eos> I gotta pop it in or you won't be able to walk.<eos> You're an infidel.<eos> I want nothing from you!

Practicing cello in flip flops and sweats at a laundromat?<eos> He seemed well-groomed for an addict, no?<eos> Dr. Rivera, perhaps, we should listen to what he's trying to say.<eos> I don't know what E.R.'s you've worked at, but I see this all the time around here.<eos> Way too much in the last 20 hours.<eos> Every addict has a habit and a story.<eos> And one more thing, you never extubated that patient.<eos> Got it?<eos> - Yeah. - You could get us both fired.<eos> Hey. Let me holler at you for a second.
Dr. Rivera, any other doctor. No one came.<eos> - Well, then you physically go and get one.<eos> - I didn't have time.<eos> What if he lost his airway, huh? What then?<eos> You know, I'll tell you what, it would've been Dr. Rivera who would've been held accountable.<eos> I was trying to protect her.<eos> You're a nurse, and a temp one at that.<eos> Do your job.<eos> Now I don't know who you are or where you come from.<eos> But I'm watching you.
I have a hundred more just like it.<eos> My book is filled with patients waiting for surgery with stories just as heartbreaking as that one.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't realize that you...<eos> That's because you've never walked in my shoes.<eos> I make hard decisions every day, deciding who lives or who dies.<eos> So... so please tell me, why should I bump your friend here ahead of little Jesse's mom?<eos> Well, what do you want?<eos> What do I want?<eos> Everyone who left, back to work with you in charge.
Taking care of triage would be a huge help.<eos> Yeah, yeah. No, we're on it. Uh...<eos> Okay, everybody, listen up!<eos> If you can hear me, raise your hand!<eos> Good.<eos> If you can walk, head to the entrance and wait for treatment.<eos> - Paul, here.<eos> - Sure.<eos> This is an area for first responders...<eos> Mollie. Mollie, please tell me you have Bri with you.
- Sure.<eos> This is an area for first responders...<eos> Mollie. Mollie, please tell me you have Bri with you.<eos> You do.<eos> Oh, thank God. Okay.<eos> Thank you, thank you.<eos> And Rick's at work? Okay.<eos> All right, um, I gotta get going.<eos> Make sure you tell her I love her. Okay.<eos> All right, yeah, you, too. Okay.
Oh, thank God. Okay.<eos> Thank you, thank you.<eos> And Rick's at work? Okay.<eos> All right, um, I gotta get going.<eos> Make sure you tell her I love her. Okay.<eos> All right, yeah, you, too. Okay.<eos> Check the levels and vitals one more time.<eos> It's amazing Mac was still alive.<eos> - Yeah. He's a survivor. - Hmm.<eos> So how about you?
On the inside, looking out.<eos> - What are you talkin' about?<eos> - The walkout.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Our living situation.<eos> You know, all of us sort of being roomies.<eos> Roomies?<eos> Wait.<eos> - You're moving in with Paul?<eos> - Yeah, you, too, right?
Margot's on board.<eos> Emma... something's off.<eos> Has Aram had any luck with her background?<eos> No.<eos> It's like her ID was professionally scrubbed.<eos> Tell him to keep looking.<eos> I'll do some digging of my own.<eos> I wanna figure out who this woman is.<eos> Something feels off about her.<eos> She works for you?
What did she tell you?<eos> Think.<eos> She burned MI-6.<eos> Burned Reddington, The Harem.<eos> She has nowhere to go.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> That's it.<eos> Hello, Emma.<eos> How did you find me?<eos> He looks just like you.
We found a sunken ship that's centuries old.<eos> Actually, Mr. Dodd, I'm here to learn about your platform for alderman.<eos> Now, some say that you're a one-issue candidate who only cares about the fate of his favorite comic book store.<eos> So, setting that topic aside for the moment, can you explain how you'd handle the budget crisis in West Altadenia, when reports are you've yet to request a copy of the city's financials from the town council.<eos> Ms. Logan, I am a genius.<eos> I haven't requested the budget because it would take me less than a few minutes to read it, identify any inefficiencies and then balance it.<eos> Budget not a priority...<eos> Uh, no, no, no. That's not what I said.<eos> What I said was...<eos> Sly, I need you.
Fair enough.<eos> There are laws.<eos> This is a mutiny!<eos> While I'm wearing a pirate hat.<eos> How cool is that?<eos> This is a win-win, Joan.<eos> You don't have to leave the Caldera, we can go find our friends.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sat phone, water, some energy bars.<eos> I doff me hat to you, fair scallywag.
Oh, tell me something I don't know.<eos> Fact:<eos> As a result, I often can't connect with humans. And how.<eos> Fact: despite knowing all that, you still abandoned me.<eos> You still let me deal with people like the Department of Energy rep when you know I shouldn't!<eos> Abandoned you?<eos> Please, Paige.<eos> You know, I-I might have no EQ, but I am more than capable of picking up when someone is trying to distance themselves from me.<eos> It happened at school when kids could tell that I was different,<eos> I felt it with my parents, and now, then... then i-it happened with you.

You have completely cut me loose these past weeks.<eos> Completely missing in action when I need you.

You have completely cut me loose these past weeks.<eos> Completely missing in action when I need you.<eos> No, I... I understand that eventually I can be too much for most humans, but I thought...<eos> I thought that... you were different.<eos> I thought that we were friends.<eos> You're right, I...<eos> I did distance myself from you... on purpose.
You're right, I...<eos> I did distance myself from you... on purpose.<eos> But it's not because I don't like you anymore.<eos> It was part of a plan to let you sink or swim, to see if... I wanted to see if you could get to another level of EQ on your own, to see if you could grow without me holding your hand, because I believe you can.<eos> So you decided to run an emotional experiment on me?<eos> No, no, that's not how I looked at it.<eos> It's your job to hold my hand.<eos> That's why you're on Scorpion.<eos> I should dock your pay.<eos> I wanted to believe that my work with you these last three years haven't been wasted, that if you fell, you could get up on your own without me there to pick you up and dust you off.
Shark's worst sense is their eyesight.<eos> They'll circle me to try and figure me out before attacking.<eos> It'll give me time.<eos> Now, as soon as I hit the water, you dive in and head for the boat.<eos> Walter, no. Even if you make it to the raft, they will tear that thing apart in seconds.<eos> You said it yourself.<eos> Eventually, this buoy gets tipped over, and I can't have you on it when that happens.<eos> Walter...<eos> As flawed as I am,<eos> I'm still a better person than before we met, thanks to you.
Oh, uh, don't think so.<eos> And it's not really the point.<eos> Well, it was the least I could do.<eos> I owed you.<eos> Owed me?<eos> For what?<eos> For, uh...<eos> for letting me sink or swim.<eos> See, at first, I was...<eos> I was mad at you because I-I didn't understand why you would do that to me.
I've never had anyone who cared about my emotional development before, someone who'd try different things to help me.<eos> But you care.<eos> And, um... sometimes caring means tough love.<eos> So I owed you, so I jumped in.<eos> An extreme way of paying off debts, but...<eos> I don't think you owed me.<eos> Walter, can I be honest?<eos> Mm, of course.<eos> You're the most honest person I know.<eos> Here goes. I-I tried being mad at you for the whole Tim thing, and that just... well, it felt crummy.
That's...<eos> That's accurate and logical.<eos> Yeah. I like it.<eos> Great.<eos> Um, we can put any recent tension behind us.<eos> Agreed. Yeah.<eos> So, friend uh, what do you have planned for tonight?<eos> I'm just gonna...<eos> like, Skype with Tim.<eos> You?
Look at that.<eos> It's quite lifelike, isn't it?<eos> Hey. Just got to the tournament.<eos> Flight was bumpy.<eos> I'm sorry... I got a mouth full of georgian pizza.<eos> How you doing?<eos> When I left. You were kind of off.<eos> I'm just. Helping my dad with some stuff.<eos> You know, I was reading markers on cabe. When he said you were with patrick.<eos> I can tell he's worried about you.
You know, I was reading markers on cabe. When he said you were with patrick.<eos> I can tell he's worried about you.<eos> Cabe doesn't know anything.<eos> I'm fine. I got to go, okay?<eos> Bye.<eos> Don't blame cabe.<eos> He's trying to help, there aren't any options.<eos> Not necessarily.<eos> I may have an idea.<eos> Happy, I know this is hard for you to accept, okay?
Paige, it's time to carbo load.<eos> What are those?<eos> They look a lot like prison specs.<eos> Yeah, well, you look a lot like a jerk.<eos> Hey, if you're thinking about. Hacking into the jail's network. To help your father, think again.<eos> Or what, you gonna arrest me, too?<eos> No, and I know I can't stop you.<eos> You're smarter than me and you'd just. Figure out a way to go behind my back.<eos> Like you did to me.<eos> I tried to help your dad. Because I care about you.
What?<eos> Natalya is about to win.<eos> We need to settle things up here. So one of us can go sit across from her asap.<eos> Fine.<eos> You forfeit.<eos> You're losing anyway.<eos> One, I am not losing.<eos> You are falling into a classic monticelli trap. And you don't even see it, and two,<eos> I'm a grandmaster.<eos> If anyone should forfeit, it is you.
I don't know about this.<eos> It's simple.<eos> After you self-surrender, they process you in this room.<eos> You see the emergency exit to the right of the desk?<eos> As soon as the clerk goes to the back. To catalog all your personal effects, I'll turn off the alarm.<eos> When the light. Above the door switches off, you walk.<eos> I'll leave. A cuff key under a brick in the alley outside.<eos> I don't know, happy.<eos> You'll need to get as big a head start as possible.<eos> Have a lot of personal effects on you. So the clerk will take a while. To enter all of them into the system.
I'm gonna go see her now.<eos> You know, I tried every move I could with the feds.<eos> Pulled every favor, Used every strategy.<eos> And in the end, I still wound up with that sweet kid. Crying in my arms.<eos> 'Cause strategy is for games, like chess.<eos> I heard natalya say. That sometimes, when it comes to the people we love, There's no refuge.<eos> Sometimes there's just pain.<eos> Happy's gonna get through this pain, If we help her.<eos> But now she has no father.<eos> Not exactly, she's got you.

Right, come on, look, I want to see some orders.<eos> Don't be shy, Lavender.<eos> Yeah, his mother wasn't.<eos> - Four.<eos> - Bollocks!<eos> 4,000.<eos> That's got to be a personal best for you, innit?<eos> Could've been seven if this snake hadn't undercut me on Warren Close.<eos> You're having a laugh.<eos> There's nothing wrong with my prices, it's just you.
Yes.<eos> I've got a ton says you can't.<eos> You had a ton.<eos> You might as well hand over those notes now, Lavatory.<eos> Right, if you bucks are done rutting, I want to see some orders.<eos> Brian?<eos> 13 five.<eos> - (HE WHISTLES)<eos> - Impressive.<eos> Who'd have thought a weaselly fucker with terrible BO like you could charm the life savings out of anyone?
- Nothing.<eos> Go and play outside.<eos> Go on, I want a word with your dad.<eos> Hello, baby.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> Incredible, isn't she?<eos> What's up?<eos> I thought Cachet's number one salesman might like some lunch.<eos> It's only cheese, but I swiped a Penguin from Robbie's school dinner tin as a little treat.<eos> I do not deserve an angel like you in my life.
Yeah, this is him.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Now, that was a call informing me that while I'd been otherwise engaged, a supertanker on the Thames estuary had been accidently loaded with contaminated crude oil.<eos> Unfortunately, the constant monitoring required to prevent such million-pound fuck-ups was my one and only job.<eos> Upon careful reflection, you are to be relieved of all duties with immediate effect.<eos> Do you have anything to say for the record, Mr Swan?<eos> This is fucking ridiculous...<eos> Maybe we should take a break.<eos> Listen, I've spoken to the boys.<eos> They're ready to walk out for you on this one, Vince.
Yeah, that was another one.<eos> You all right, Vince?<eos> You look like shit.<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm not all right, Dicky.<eos> I got sacked this morning, and now I'm crying next to a urinal full of my own puke, talking to you.<eos> No offence, but I think I just hit rock-bottom.<eos> (DICKY LAUGHS)<eos> I mean, it's funny how life turns out, innit?<eos> Who'd have put money on me being the bloody successful one and you, Vincent Swan, being such a fucking loser?
White gold was just plastic, a cheap alternative to timber, but it brought the cost of making brand-new windows down to peanuts.<eos> Coxy would then sell them on with a 600% mark-up.<eos> For those that couldn't afford the astronomical prices, he'd sell them finance.<eos> That way, they could pay back what they thought they could afford each month... for the rest of their natural lives.<eos> Eventually, those shiny new windows would cost more than their dreary former council houses.<eos> It was beautiful.<eos> I want this.<eos> You can have it.<eos> No, not this!<eos> I mean, meeting you. Losing my job. Everything.
Hello, stranger.<eos> Evening, Gillian.<eos> At last, the brains of the house have arrived.<eos> I'd better run, I'm on nights.<eos> You'll have to bring the family over for a barbecue soon, Vince.<eos> Yeah, they'd love that, mate.<eos> - Bye, love.<eos> - Ta, darling.<eos> Try not to masturbate through your entire shift.<eos> Someone's got to sit in that chair after you.
Double glazing.<eos> Fancy.<eos> I quite like them patio doors.<eos> I bet they're expensive, though.<eos> You'd be surprised, Gillian.<eos> I know this looks bad, but those patio doors are going to completely revolutionise the flow from their downstairs to their garden.<eos> What?<eos> This is what I do.<eos> Cachet Windows and Doors.<eos> It's Brendan for you.
No way.<eos> It's not snide gear either.<eos> Dad, you're the best.<eos> Vincent, that cost a fortune.<eos> No, my love, this cost a fortune.<eos> Ta-da.<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> Is that real mink?<eos> Unless Liberty's have started skinning cats, it is real.<eos> - Look at you.
Which is exactly why I think I deserve one.<eos> You are delusional, mate.<eos> You're having a tin bath!<eos> Not by my lights.<eos> Do you know how much business I've brought in<eos> - these past three months?<eos> - You know, the problem with you is you've formed your own fan club.<eos> The Vincent Swan fan club.<eos> Membership one, Vincent Swan.<eos> You.
The amount of money we're making selling advertising space.<eos> - Now, what are you boys drinking?<eos> - Nah, let me get these.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> I insist.<eos> We're already running a tab.<eos> I'll just claim it back on the old expenses.<eos> What's your poison?<eos> I'm not fussed.<eos> Whatever you're having.
But it did save me from having to fellate the client myself.<eos> Here you go, boyses.<eos> Winner.<eos> Winner.<eos> Winner.<eos> Nice meeting you, boyses.<eos> If you ever fancy leaving the lucrative world of door to door sales, give us a call.<eos> We're always on the lookout for new blood at Millman Young.<eos> - Who do we ask for?<eos> - Yeah, I wasn't talking to you.
You obviously are aware the name Fitzpatrick is synonymous with fucking things up.<eos> Yeah, well, unless you want it to be "synonymous"<eos> with getting the sack, I suggest you start showing your new boss some respect.<eos> Okay.<eos> One, you're not my new boss, you're just a temporary manager.<eos> Two, respect is earned, mate, not demanded, and three... you haven't got the balls to sack me.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well I'll see your...<eos> and I'll raise you.<eos> Oh, I'm not going to fire you, mate, I've got something much, much worse in store for you.
No.<eos> We didn't get a chance to chat the other day.<eos> Well, we may have had a brief exchange, but...<eos> - Did we?<eos> Yes, we did, there was an exchange.<eos> Pffff. It's forgotten.<eos> Water under the bridge. Let's move on.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Let's put it behind us.<eos> Now, Vincent, can I be frank with you?
Absolutely.<eos> Let's put it behind us.<eos> Now, Vincent, can I be frank with you?<eos> You can be whoever you want, Andy.<eos> I find this whole concept of interviewing very flawed.<eos> You know, two people sat across a desk, best foot forward, spinning lie after lie at one another.<eos> It's like being on a blind date.<eos> - Hopefully with less fingering at the end.<eos> - Ha, yeah.<eos> Listen, I'll be completely straight with you, if your sales figures and your references back up what my gut tells me about you, then this interview is already two minutes too long.
- for these windows, Ronnie?<eos> - What do you think?<eos> So, Maggie can expect someone round to measure up, what... on Monday?<eos> Monday.<eos> Monday's great.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you.<eos> I'll be seeing you.<eos> I love your little telly.<eos> Oh, dear, did someone shoot the Sheriff?<eos> Even for a bag of shit like you, you look like a bag of shit, mate.
Dogging.<eos> What the fuck's dogging?<eos> Dogging is the combination of two revolutions, the motor vehicle revolution and the sexual revolution, making the ultimate form of sexual expression.<eos> You sly old dog.<eos> This has the potential to be interesting.<eos> Fucking hell.<eos> Are there people having sex in these cars?<eos> Yes, if that's all right with you, Lavender?<eos> What are we doing?<eos> I don't know about you but I'm going to go and have a wank over some dirty fuckers screwing in a car park.
I've let you all down.<eos> Right, here's what you're going to do.<eos> You're going to go back to Walshy, and ask him for your job back.<eos> - You might have to start a rung down..<eos> - I can't, Sam.<eos> It won't be for long, will it?<eos> Fitzpatrick will be lucky if he gets another week as showroom manager.<eos> I don't think I can do it.<eos> Vincent, look at me.<eos> No-one believes in you more than you do, baby.
Before you say anything you might regret, come with me.<eos> Ta-dah.<eos> Ford Granada IX.<eos> Top-of-the-range.<eos> Your company car.<eos> Really?<eos> I think you've forgotten I don't work here any more.<eos> Come on, don't milk it.<eos> This is me saying sorry.<eos> I need you back, Vincent.
Uhm, thanks.<eos> If you do happen to run into Mr Swan please do let him know that I stopped by.<eos> Will do...<eos> I mean, I would do... if I could, but I can't.<eos> Cos I don't even know him and he's never worked here.<eos> Bye.<eos> Lavatory couldn't wait to grass you up.<eos> Don't be a cock.<eos> I was trying to get her out of the showroom.<eos> You and your student comrades might want to go and live in Russia but, here, in the free West, we try not to inform on our pals.
- Donna?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> All right wait here.<eos> All right, look, it's got auto focus so all you need to do is point and shoot.<eos> And then making copies is pretty easy.<eos> You just put the master copy into one machine, press play.<eos> Then take a blank tape and put it into the other machine and press play and record.<eos> There you go.<eos> That's it.<eos> If you film it and run off a couple of copies, there's a 20 in it for you.
Not exactly.<eos> Our customers get a great product for their money.<eos> Our precision-engineered windows and doors are...<eos> Fucking hell I'm starting to sound like Vince...<eos> Winston.<eos> Oh, yeah, good old Winston Ston.<eos> Come on, we're outside of business hours now, you don't have to keep the guard up.<eos> Frankly, it's weird enough we're doing this anyway.<eos> This isn't that weird.<eos> I'm not usually this impulsive, there was just something about you that made me throw caution to the wind.
She didn't want to screw you?<eos> Nope.<eos> After that she said goodnight, shook my hand and told me she wouldn't be around any more.<eos> She did leave this fucking great bite mark on my shoulder as a memento, though<eos> - Ouch.<eos> Might need a rabies shot for that, mate.<eos> Don't push your luck, mate.<eos> I've basically whored myself<eos> - to clear the coast for you.<eos> - You know I'd do the same for you, mate.
You've got to be fucking kidding me.<eos> Universal Pictures are offering a £1,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.<eos> Now, these pirate recordings do not only feature the lovable alien, there's also a rather bizarre intermission featuring a conventionally pretty young lady.<eos> Maybe you know the young lady involved, or maybe you recognise the room where she's modelling...<eos> Holy Mother of God!<eos> (PHONE RINGS)<eos> Hello?<eos> Stanford 4163.<eos> Sorry, he's out, Walshy.<eos> You'll have to calm down, I can't understand a word you're saying.
What?<eos> I saw Police fucking Five.<eos> Have you been out in the sun a bit too much this weekend, Tony?<eos> Tony, your wife called.<eos> I told her you were busy hunting for topless models.<eos> But she said call her back immediately.<eos> Looks like someone should "phone home."<eos> I'll take it downstairs.<eos> I know you pricks have been up to something.<eos> Oh, this came for you, Martin.
Morning, Rubber Ducky.<eos> Yep, very good.<eos> Okay, let's do this properly, who or what is a Gremlin?<eos> He's a mate.<eos> And his name's actually Gremlin?<eos> No, that's his handle.<eos> It's like a CB nickname.<eos> And your handle is...?<eos> Nice try, but save your breath, I'm not embarrassed about this.<eos> Good for you.
After an hour of some fairly horrific flirting, the Widow Maker finally worked up the bottle to ask the Elf on a date.<eos> Tri-Star, 48 channels.<eos> Dual bandwidth.<eos> Ooh!<eos> Impressive kit.<eos> I'd love to see it.<eos> 'And after that maybe I'll show you my CB radio too.'<eos> (SHE LAUGHS)<eos> I'll show you mine if you show me yours.<eos> I'm up for an eyeball if you are?
Jackpot.<eos> That's a relief.<eos> I thought I was going to have to flash my chuff.<eos> Yeah, why not, Widow Maker?<eos> They fixed up to meet later that night at Thorndon Country Park.<eos> This is The Widow Maker.<eos> I'm 10-8 at the 10-20.<eos> I think I can see you, Sexy Elf.<eos> Widow Maker, meet the Sexy Elf.<eos> Fancy seeing you here, good buddy.
I've got a bum stain on my desk and a rubber Johnny in my fucking bin!<eos> Much like the derriere that left its mark on Walshy's desk, I didn't mind taking a pounding for the sake of Fitzpatrick's morale.<eos> Whose bum is this, for Christ's sake?<eos> Morning, homo sapiens.<eos> Emphasis on the homo.<eos> So unnecessary.<eos> Pretty soon Fitzpatrick was back to his cocky, old unpleasant self.<eos> Now that's what you call man management.<eos> And seeing as I'd already taken a bollocking for the misuse of Walshy's office, I figured I might as well commit the crime.<eos> Come here, you.
Right.<eos> So, Maureen, it looks like you're my neighbour tonight.<eos> So where's Brian been hiding you this past year, eh?<eos> He's ashamed of my size, so he pretends I don't exist.<eos> And I'm disappointed with his choice of profession and sexual impotence, so it swings both ways, doesn't it?<eos> Please, Maureen.<eos> Right, who wants some bubbly?<eos> Oh, yeah, before we get stuck in can we just establish how we're splitting the bill?<eos> I'm not really a champagne drinker, so I might as well get my own.<eos> It's all right, Scrooge McFuck, this is my treat, a thank you to everyone who made it all possible, and you.
Cor blimey!<eos> If I'd known it was going to be this entertaining I'd have paid for dinner myself.<eos> Shut up, you wally!<eos> You're fired.<eos> All right, let's call a truce on the pranks now, shall we?<eos> No, read my lips.<eos> You're fucking sacked.<eos> Whatever you say, boss(!<eos> ) Walshy will finish up with you next week.<eos> It'll be minus whatever the fuck I've laid out feeding you and Little Miss Sunshine over there.
Eh?<eos> Are you going to find 50 grand down the back of the sofa?<eos> Like I always do, on my own.<eos> This isn't a game, Vincent.<eos> It's not another one of your showroom pranks.<eos> It's £50,000.<eos> We could lose our house, everything.<eos> Will you slow down?<eos> I don't remember you being so concerned about my tax affairs while you were out fucking spending all over the place.<eos> Fucking hell, that is pathetic, even for a scumbag like you.
There's a line, Sam, that's all I'm saying, all right?<eos> There's only so much I can take.<eos> A line you crossed by fucking our son's schoolteacher.<eos> Fucking hell!<eos> She wanted a conservatory.<eos> We've been through this.<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> I just wish you had the fucking bollocks to admit it.<eos> I mean, I've always known you were a fucking piece of shit, but what's Robbie going to think, eh?<eos> What kind of father does that make you?
Oh, Okay.<eos> Who does then?<eos> Look, mate, I'm really not in the mood for this.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Why not?<eos> !<eos> Because I'm getting divorced.<eos> Because I owe the taxman 50 fucking grand.<eos> Because I've gone from being salesman of the century to a schlub who can't sell shit.<eos> But mainly because I spend my entire fucking life on this phone talking to perverts like you.
And before you say anything, I'm not trying to get my job back.<eos> Good, because you're not fucking getting it back.<eos> Ever.<eos> Like I said, just... came to apologise and hopefully in time you'll be able to forgive me.<eos> So... thanks for listening.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, off you fuck then.<eos> Right.<eos> Oh, there was one more thing, would it be all right if I pop by the showroom, just to pick up a few bits and pieces, say goodbye to the team properly?<eos> No-one gives a shit about you but it's a free country.
How does that sound?<eos> Un-fucking likely.<eos> You're not going to quit and we both know it.<eos> What we both do know is without me you'd have lost that disgusting shirt on your hairy fucking back by now.<eos> That was before your recent personal problems.<eos> You ain't selling shit at the moment, boy.<eos> Sales have dipped, granted, but that's more due to a downturn in consumer confidence,<eos> - market forces.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> You tell yourself whatever bollocks you like, bottom line is our consumers have lost confidence in you.
Hang on, I was just about tell you Nature-Burn's...<eos> Shove your diet pills up your arse.<eos> Well, unfortunately Nature-Burn don't do suppositories, but soon as they do, I'll happily shove them up my arse.<eos> Martin, mate, hold up, let me buy you a pint.<eos> So, these diet pills work then?<eos> How much you charging?<eos> £30 for a month's supply.<eos> But I am running a one week's free trial to get people hooked...<eos> I mean, to get them on the road to a healthier lifestyle.<eos> I'm prepared to make that exclusive one-time offer exclusively to you, Tony.

Mate, you should have seen your fucking face, it was priceless.<eos> What the fuck are you doing here?<eos> Look, I understand you're annoyed.<eos> I'm sorry I fucked up today.<eos> But I came to apologise and saw Robbie and he was like, "Can you stay with me and watch Minder?"<eos> Do you know what, I panicked.<eos> I'll take the house off the market tomorrow.<eos> Sam?<eos> Sam, come on, don't be like that!<eos> I'm sorry for being a dick to you about that council job.
I'm sorry for being a dick to you about that council job.<eos> It's already forgotten.<eos> Robbie told me you brought him home and took Sam out to cheer her up.<eos> You're taking care of my family better than I am at the moment.<eos> Come on, mate.<eos> I know things are tough right now but you'll pull through.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, are you on the old diet pills because I've lost mine and I'm starting to shake like a fucking leaf right now.<eos> Whoa, ooh, oh!<eos> Nobody wants you here.
Now, you and I both know he couldn't have vanished The Statue of fucking Liberty... but look into his eyes.<eos> Tell me he doesn't 100% believe that he just made her disappear for real.<eos> What you're looking at there, folks, is the secret of sales.<eos> Believe in what you're selling.<eos> I'd forgotten that, and it's almost cost me everything I love, my wife, my kids, my money.<eos> But now it's time to start taking it all back the only way I know how, by selling the greatest product that exists on this beautiful planet... me.<eos> Aren't you going to be late for school?<eos> - But we're not finished here.<eos> - Oh, I think we are, sweetheart.<eos> You want me to piss away my money starting a double glazing company with you?
I'm sick of sneaking around for quickies in lay-bys.<eos> - It's not a good time to go public.<eos> - What?<eos> !<eos> We're not Charles and Diana, the public don't give a shit.<eos> The only people that care will be the kids, and Nat and Robbie like you.<eos> Christ knows they want me to be happy.<eos> It's not just them though, is it, it's Vincent.<eos> I can't do this.<eos> I love being with you.
Are you going get to meet the Queen?<eos> Not unless she works at a tax office in Southend-on-Sea.<eos> She doesn't.<eos> I'm pretty sure she works in London.<eos> Vincent, can I have a word?<eos> This sounds serious.<eos> Is Paul Young suing us about the ad?<eos> Let's go upstairs.<eos> Have you been upsetting him again?<eos> I know things haven't been easy between you and Sam, and the last thing I want is to add to your problems...

Thanks.<eos> What has Sam said exactly?<eos> That you've been disillusioned for a while.<eos> The music business pulling at your heart strings.<eos> - Was that all she said?<eos> - No.<eos> Apparently I'm a narcissist, a scumbag, a terrible father and I'm going to die lonely.<eos> No, I meant...<eos> Look, mate, I know I haven't been a great boss these past few months, but can you give me a few more weeks?<eos> There are some big changes about to happen around here, and I need you.

- it was just a bit of fun.<eos> - Oh.<eos> And how can I help exactly?<eos> You go and see her, you tell her I still love her, I need her...<eos> That might be a bit weird.<eos> Maybe you should talk to her yourself?<eos> It's hard to have a conversation while you're dodging the glasses getting launched at your head.<eos> Well, maybe don't go to the house, arrange to meet her on neutral territory.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> And be honest about how you feel, about how much she means to you.

Don't call me fucking babe!<eos> Here she comes, the love of my life, your beautiful mother.<eos> All right, wish me luck.<eos> What the fuck is this, Vincent?<eos> Sorry, Robbie.<eos> This is our new family abode.<eos> Chez Swan.<eos> Are you deranged?<eos> We're getting a divorce.<eos> I don't want to live with you ever again, you terrible wanker.
This is our new family abode.<eos> Chez Swan.<eos> Are you deranged?<eos> We're getting a divorce.<eos> I don't want to live with you ever again, you terrible wanker.<eos> Sorry, Robbie.<eos> Sam, I know I fucked up.<eos> Sorry, Robbie.<eos> You have every right to hate me, but I want you back.<eos> I need you back.
Sam, I know I fucked up.<eos> Sorry, Robbie.<eos> You have every right to hate me, but I want you back.<eos> I need you back.<eos> Plus, I've just put down a non-refundable deposit for ten grand on this place so, please, just have a look?<eos> Please, Mum, have a look.<eos> - It's fucking amazing in there.<eos> Right, Vincent, five minutes.<eos> Come on.<eos> After you.
I should've respected her, Philip.<eos> I adore her.<eos> I should have made her feel like she was my first and only thought instead of making her feel like she was my last.<eos> Is it Okay if I pop downstairs and let you both have a think about it?<eos> No, you stay, Philip.<eos> You need to see me beg.<eos> If it's too late, Sam, tell me, and I'll leave you to get on with the rest of your life.<eos> I'm so sorry, baby.<eos> I lost my way.<eos> It's always been you that made my world turn and I fucked it.

It's always been you that made my world turn and I fucked it.<eos> But I need you.<eos> I can't do any of it without you.<eos> So I'm begging for one last chance.<eos> In front of Philip.<eos> Begging.<eos> Look at me begging, Philip!<eos> So come on, Sam.<eos> If not for me, do it for Philip.<eos> Get off the floor, you wally.
It won't take long.<eos> I'm going to say what I've got to say,<eos> - then I'm going to go.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Don't be such a drama queen.<eos> It's Sam.<eos> What?<eos> What about Sam can't wait until tomorrow?<eos> No, it's Sam.<eos> Behind you.
The deal was I helped you fuck over Walshy and then we run the business as partners.<eos> Yeah, there's been a complication.<eos> It turns out that as a former director of Cachet you've been barred by the Companies House from becoming a director of the new business for five years.<eos> I'm sorry, mate, but it was unforeseen.<eos> Bollocks was it.<eos> Pull!<eos> What about my partnership?<eos> We can still be partners in the business, Vinny, just not in a legal sense.<eos> More like hombres.<eos> I'll tell you what, Ronnie, you can stick your hombres up your hombrarsehole.
My mom's great, but, uh, sometimes, uh, everything's about her.<eos> I'm not even gonna be living there in a few years. I just-<eos> - I need to be able to make my own decisions.<eos> You already do make your own decisions, Paige.<eos> Do you remember when we first met?<eos> Yeah, kind of.<eos> - Kind of?<eos> - Well, no, yeah.<eos> Uh, you guys came over, right?<eos> I had the biggest crush on you.
Renee.<eos> And?<eos> It was good.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she's usually here about now.<eos> She loves sports.<eos> She knows more about sports than you, actually.
And?<eos> It was good.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she's usually here about now.<eos> She loves sports.<eos> She knows more about sports than you, actually.<eos> It was like being out with a female version of you.
I'll just be alone for the rest of my life. Would that make you feel better?<eos> Are you finished?<eos> There's something we can show you, a technique to help you keep your emotions in check, to help you stay in control.<eos> If you can learn this thing, really master it, you can keep seeing him if that's what you want.<eos> Do you want us to show you?<eos> Before we start, if you ever feel that you're losing control with Matthew, really losing control, just tell him you need some time to think.<eos> Then you come find us, and we'll figure out what to do together.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Now, if you're with him and things start to get uncomfortable or go bad, you're feeling overwhelmed or emotional or uncertain, rub your thumb and your forefinger together and picture me and your father to help remind yourself of who you are and where you come from.<eos> It's just a little thing, but if you practice it, it'll always be there for you.
Like changing his shirt is gonna make anybody like him.<eos> He should try learning a few more words in English and quit talking about how much he hates his dad.<eos> He's lucky he has a dad.<eos> He's always picking at his food, while his mother is telling him what to eat, Like a baby.<eos> Back home, I ate garbage off the street most days.<eos> Other days, I never ate at all.<eos> My father died when I was six.<eos> In the war?<eos> No, after. But before... Before he died, there wasn't enough food.<eos> Not as bad as you, but... We went hungry a lot.
We don't know what we're talking about yet.<eos> Maybe they're infecting the grain shipments. And maybe the bugs are intended to attack our own harvests.<eos> They could send them over in a million different ways.<eos> We'll get to Oklahoma as soon as we can.<eos> We told Paige a little bit about what we're doing here.<eos> How did that go?<eos> Looks like she's, uh, rethinking a lot of things.<eos> including us.<eos> She doesn't like people being starved.<eos> She feels closer to you.
Hut, hut, hike!<eos> That's one of them.<eos> Same again.<eos> Hut, hut, hike!<eos> Button hook!<eos> Pretty cool that Henry got moved into an advanced math class.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Turns out he's the brains in the family.<eos> And I thought studying was the key to success.<eos> You and me both.
_<eos> _<eos> Elizabeth on line three.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is... everything okay with you?
This es-- is Stacey McAllister.<eos> There is an appointment available tomorrow-- 11:00 AM, Bess Truman Park.<eos> Uh, say again?<eos> 11:00 AM, Bess Truman Park.<eos> All right?<eos> Y-Yes.<eos> To old scars and new skin.<eos> How long were you in for?<eos> 12 years.<eos> You?
All right?<eos> Y-Yes.<eos> To old scars and new skin.<eos> How long were you in for?<eos> 12 years.<eos> You?<eos> Seven.<eos> Collateral damage?<eos> Just me.<eos> How 'bout you?
But if there was a grain that could resist pests, drought, fungi, the poorest people in the world could feed themselves-- even in third-world countries or under the worst dictatorships.<eos> You see, famines cause wars.<eos> You know, a single pest can cause mass starvation.<eos> You're a real idealist.<eos> No, I'm-- I'm a realist.<eos> - We need to develop crops that can withstand almost anything.<eos> How are you gonna do that?<eos> Well, we, uh-- we take the strongest wheat plants from around the world, we cross-breed them, then we get the most destructive pests we can find, test the new plants, and breed again.<eos> And we're-- we're making a lot of progress, and we're close to developing the strongest strain of wheat the world's ever known.<eos> And you...
When you have it...<eos> Well, I mean, I-I work for a company, and they sell it.<eos> But it would make food supplies cheap and reliable around the world everywhere-- in Africa, Asia, places where people suffer through cycles of famine.<eos> I mean, it might never happen again.<eos> Old patterns between parents and children create barriers that keep us from seeing what's really there.<eos> And what is really there?<eos> Love.<eos> It's all around us.<eos> But because we can't see it, can't experience it, it seems like it must be very far away.<eos> You can't experience the love your parents have for you or you for your children, when old habits and belief systems-- all the things your mind is telling you about who they are, who you are-- stand in the way.
Yeah. Yeah, of course.<eos> Who's going to... um, who'll be the pastor?<eos> I-I just told the board last night.<eos> There will be a hiring committee.<eos> It's two months before I leave.<eos> We love our life here, the congregation.<eos> But we just started talking about Claire Louise, growing up seeing more of the world, speaking Spanish...<eos> I was down there after college, in Ecuador.<eos> Being bilingual would be great for her.<eos> I just hope Claire Louise grows up to have as big a heart as you.
Well, what about your kids?<eos> Not really.<eos> That sucks.<eos> Yup.<eos> Natalie Granholm.<eos> And they're sure it's her?<eos> It just says to go ahead.<eos> They saw the same pictures we saw.<eos> I think it looks like her.<eos> Don't you?
So stoked!<eos> Level 2, I'm coming for you.<eos> With that incredible run, Shaun takes second place.<eos> But she wasn't the only one who rose to the challenge.<eos> Our next three competitors put on quite a show.<eos> Starting with Omar Zamitiz, a rehab trainer from Mexico.<eos> He's number one!<eos> Go, Omar!<eos> Go, Mexico!<eos> We're with you!
And that puts Mexico's Matias Chávez on the bubble.<eos> So, it all comes down to this.<eos> It's the last competitor of Level 2, and it's also our last American standing, Shaun Provost.<eos> If she can score more than 100 points, she'll be moving on to Level 3, and Matias, well, he'll be eliminated.<eos> This young woman is focused and ready to do this for her, her country, and her mom.<eos> I was raised by a single mom. She's my biggest support.<eos> She was always strong for my sister and I.<eos> It was always, "How can we get it done?"<eos> And I have taken that with me everywhere I go.<eos> This one's for you, Mom.
- You help me.<eos> I'll give you the name of your wife's killer.<eos> The guy you're looking for... is currently serving for two other murders in San Quentin, and his name is Wes Gillian.<eos> What're you gonna do about it?<eos> I want you to help me steal the time machine to save Jess.<eos> Will you help me save my wife?<eos> Hi.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Nice place.<eos> Look, I'm sorry, I know it's so late, but I need to tell you something, and I'm only telling you because I trust you.
- I've done my research.<eos> What if someone gets hurt?<eos> I'm gonna go back and make sure the killer's parent's never meet.<eos> That way, he's never born.<eos> Nobody's getting hurt.<eos> Lucy, Jessica's killer murdered two other women.<eos> My hope is to save all three.<eos> - What about Rufus?<eos> - I got him covered.<eos> What about you?
- So, crazy being stuck here.<eos> Makes you wonder what we're gonna do... to pass time.<eos> You could play Galaga.<eos> That's one idea.<eos> Um, I'm gonna go put on some music.<eos> Dude.<eos> Go talk to her.<eos> Um... she kind of scares me.<eos> I mean, it's the whole Olivia Newton-John of it all.<eos> Anyways, I'd rather just stay and hang with you.
- My God! - Wait, wait, wait.<eos> - Hold on!<eos> - No, he's got a gun!<eos> - Joel! - He's got a gun!<eos> Stop it, stop it, stop it.<eos> It's okay. Don't worry.<eos> It's just... it's important to me that you guys aren't together.<eos> Okay, listen, listen, I'm sorry.<eos> You seemed like a really nice guy, you did.<eos> - It's not you, I just...
It worked out exactly as you planned!<eos> Yeah, and I bought a China cat to sit opposite of it so there's a real nice tension.<eos> And he's not putting money in there, 'cause he says he can't trust me.<eos> But when she's looking, I put my lips to its slot and I whisper my wishes.<eos> I got secrets, Marilyn.<eos> Your mother's been opening my mail for 45 years, which is a federal offense.<eos> I opened a birthday card from your sister.<eos> Are you hiding something?<eos> I don't know, Marilyn.<eos> You read it.
Yeah, it wasn't cool.<eos> I had to cancel-cancel like six shows.<eos> I-I still owe them a lot of money.<eos> I'm on, I'm on... a payment plan.<eos> Yeah, I've never bailed on a show.<eos> I had a temperature of 495 degrees.<eos> I was the temperature of a fully charred pork chop.<eos> But I did my 90-minute set, then I lost control of my bowels.<eos> That's awesome, man.<eos> Good for you.
That's when someone declares their undying love for you, and then disappears off the face of the Earth.<eos> Can't happen in a small town.<eos> The person will just say, "I see you over there."<eos> I tried to explain to my mom that show business is like having a friend with a terrible drinking problem.<eos> I love her so much.<eos> She's so much fun if you get her at right... The just... the right time of...<eos> "You're the most beautiful."<eos> So, you're my best friend.<eos> I love you, okay?<eos> Only you.
And I gotta convince her to flower open with juice and stories.<eos> All we need is, uh... two alcoholics, a suicide, and a Seven, and we could break for popcorn.<eos> It's so much fun!<eos> Have you ever read the work of Dr. John and Judy Gottman?<eos> They're family therapists.<eos> You-you watch for the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in all of your relationships without criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling.<eos> So let's say your friend says, "Hey, look at that sailboat!"<eos> You say "Criticism."<eos> That's a stupid sailboat. Contempt."<eos> You and your fucking sailboats!
And they gave us this magnet that looks like a piece of flooring, and you hand it to your partner when you're done speaking and you say, now you have the floor.<eos> And... It costs $900.<eos> We got our pictures taken with their cardboard cutout 'cause they couldn't be there.<eos> And they've... They've also gave us an acronym for love, which is, Letting Others Voluntarily Evolve.<eos> It was so fucking fun!<eos> Um, my husband and I do LARP.<eos> We Live Action Role Play... as our mothers.<eos> Hey, Linda.<eos> Listen, it's Marilyn.<eos> I got myself a new purse with my Hilton Honors Points and I just, uh, I thought of you.
He is alone.<eos> And everyone must let themselves be caught because otherwise the game will never end, and it is a shit game.<eos> Everybody just wants to play soccer, a game of individual achievement and glory.<eos> So, um, anyways, if we could just blob it on a few things. Um...<eos> I could hang a religion on that.<eos> Anyways, that's my, that's what I love.<eos> Thank you so much for cooperating!<eos> That was amazing! That was fun!<eos> One big blob.<eos> I should have blobbed with you, Arnold.

Let him have it.<eos> Gilfoyle thought he was too good to work on SeeFood, and now he's about to lose a fortune.<eos> Ready for test.<eos> After you, milady.<eos> Oh, this is weird.<eos> Mia just texted me "Good luck with the demo."<eos> Did any of you guys tell her about this?<eos> Your hacker girlfriend wouldn't happen to know the model of our router, would she?<eos> Why didn't you say anything?<eos> Why would I tell you she said something nice about you?
Just so you know, this does not mean I don't trust her.<eos> I'm just doing this so you'll, like, shut up and leave me alone.<eos> Mia, if you're listening, you're so pretty.<eos> Oh, you're both headed to Gavin's?<eos> Indeed we are.<eos> Together again.<eos> Butch Cassidy and his head of business development.<eos> Oh, wow, another Western reference.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - You know, he'd hire you, too.
A hut.<eos> A hut?<eos> A palapa, and so what?<eos> What do you mean it's a half-a-million-dollar palapa?<eos> Erlich, is the refrigerator running?<eos> This is Mike Hunt, and he's rich.<eos> Shit!<eos> Oh, hey, when you begged Richard for the job, did you actually, like, literally lick his boots, or did you just go like,<eos> "Pretty please, Richard. Please can I have a job, Richard?"<eos> Whatever I did, it was worth it for the chance to work without you.
Goldfoil!<eos> Go team!<eos> Uh... the fuck just happened?<eos> Wh... uh, next time you're at a meeting of our company, of which you are not a part of in any respect, can you please keep your little ideas to yourself?<eos> I'm... I'm sorry. I'm just...<eos> Well, you weren't, at all.<eos> I mean, we had him on our side, because I'd basically just convinced Gavin that a stealth rollout was the best idea.<eos> It's just a stealth rollout doesn't sound like the way to go to me. What-What...<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I mean, Gavin has obviously had a lot more success than you, Richard, and I just think having an asset like Gavin Belson on your side...
Well, that's typical, because people who look like me, we never get taken seriously in the tech business by people who look like you.<eos> You're biased.<eos> Whoa. Hang on. I am not biased.<eos> Aw, come on! Hey, the whole business is biased!<eos> I mean, that's the only way that a good-looking guy like me could get in a room with Gavin Belson, is by being a blood boy!<eos> And that sucks. I...<eos> I got to work out constantly. I can't have a beer with my friends. I can't eat junk food.<eos> Do you know that Gavin made me go full veg?<eos> I mean, fuck soy, man!<eos> But to people like you, I'm just a beautiful bag of blood.

You clearly fucking don't.
I'm with Jared.<eos> You should wait.<eos> I have to end it, right now.<eos> First thing Monday.<eos> Well, Saturday is her sister's wedding.<eos> And then Sunday... you know, Sundays are just for me, you guys know that.<eos> Wait. Her sister's wedding?<eos> That's what you should be afraid of.<eos> That's a threshold that you don't want to cross.<eos> Well, I mean, weddings are very public events with photographers taking pictures of you indelibly tied to her.
It's... To be honest, I was kind of all over the map.<eos> I shotgunned a warm beer, and then I acted all blown away when he showed me 40 minutes of snowboarding videos set to Diplo remixes.<eos> Good on you.<eos> But it worked.<eos> I'm in.<eos> Ed copped to everything, and said that as long as I don't say anything to Laurie,<eos> Wait. Did he say that? Those were his exact words?<eos> You'll have a seat if you don't tell Laurie?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So? Oh, dear. That does not bode well for you.

That does not bode well for you.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, if Ed Chen is afraid of you saying anything to Laurie, then that means that the deal isn't solidified yet.<eos> He doesn't have the votes.<eos> Unfortunately for you, that would mean you may have put your money on the wrong horse.
Unfortunately for you, that would mean you may have put your money on the wrong horse.<eos> So you mean Laurie still has a chance to survive this coup?<eos> Well, then why did you say I should bro down with Ed Chen?<eos> I say a lot of things, Monica.<eos> I say a lot of things.<eos> I know you think I'm some sort of crusading badass who built a ticking time bomb and slipped it to Gavin Belson to bring him down as retribution for his wrongdoings.<eos> But the truth is, because of my gross incompetence during my brief and utterly disgraceful tenure as PiperChat CEO,<eos> I incurred billions of dollars in COPPA fines by exploiting underage users, and was saved only by my own cowardice, which led to me throwing up on myself.<eos> Anyway, I'll show myself out.<eos> I'm so proud of you.
Paranoid?<eos> No.<eos> You know, Bryce, I got to be honest, I'm a little hungry.<eos> Do you have anything to eat?<eos> Uh, just some creatine, protein powder, soy extract.<eos> Well, I'm kind of looking for something a little bit more sweet.<eos> Oh, Bryce!<eos> That... That's not mine.<eos> That's for my guests. My... My fat guests.<eos> You know, the fella who owns the house I live in, he buys food like this, because when he uses the products he buys at the very same health food store you go to, he gets cravings... for food just like this.
It's a pot dispensary.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> I got you, Bryce! You fuckin' liar!<eos> You said you had a degree in CS.<eos> Well, bullshit.<eos> It's "Calisthenic Studies." What? What?<eos> You listen to me, you muscle-bound, handsome Adonis.<eos> Tech is reserved for people like me. Okay?<eos> The freaks, the weirdos, the misfits, the geeks, the dweebs, the dorks!<eos> Not you.
Oh! Out of what exactly?<eos> My relationship!<eos> The wedding got raided.<eos> The FBI got an anonymous tip about Mia's hacking exploits.<eos> Can you believe that?<eos> Just my luck! I'm home free!<eos> You ratted your girlfriend out to the FBI, because you're too big of a pussy to break up with her?<eos> I'll never tell, but yes, yes, I did.<eos> The FBI lady hit me in the face, so Mia's never going to suspect me.<eos> Uh, Richard, now that Mia and I have parted ways, can I come work for you at Gavin's?
You brought swag to a pitch meeting?<eos> Yikes, that's so three years ago.<eos> Have you seen Keenan yet?<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> Seriously, though, I don't know who you're talking about.<eos> Bream-Hall?<eos> Hey, man.<eos> I don't know who you think you are, but you're not supposed to be at this table.<eos> I don't know who you think you are, but men aren't supposed to grow tits, and yet there they are, atop your little paunch.<eos> Who the fuck are you?
I can't believe I jeopardized the entire company with my dick.<eos> We can get through this.<eos> Yeah. All right. First, I need some details.<eos> Are you in love?<eos> What?<eos> No, no, I barely know her.<eos> Okay. Okay, that's good.<eos> Then, we just need to extricate you from this situation.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now, it's not gonna be easy, because she's very probably in love with you.
Point being, we can find another customer, and then use that upfront payment to cover Melcher's fees.<eos> That's like getting a new credit card to pay off your old credit card.<eos> Yeah, and as CFO, I should tell you we've already done that seven times.<eos> Look, I don't have any moral issue with any of that, but it was hard enough to get Melcher.<eos> How the fuck are we gonna get a second Melcher?<eos> It's cold out here.<eos> Can almost see my breath, huh?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Well, uh... it's just that the guys are a little agitated, because we seem to be having minor money troubles.<eos> I was thinking since you and Bream-Hall signed such a big check over to Keenan Feldspar and since you are his keyman, maybe you could help set up a data storage deal like we had with Melcher?

No, I'm...<eos> I'm not a VR guy.<eos> Richard doesn't like things that are cool or fun or taste good.<eos> Plus, it makes him queasy.<eos> He has a sensitive constitution.<eos> Ah, come on. You're gonna do it.<eos> Look at him. He's gonna do it.<eos> It's gonna be awesome!<eos> Come on! You're doing it!<eos> - Come on, come on. After you. - Okay, sure.
But we're not for sale, guys.<eos> Richard, listen, it's like we've been lost at sea for a long time on a tiny boat, and there is no wind.<eos> And now, through sheer luck, we've just happen to drift right up to Hawaii.<eos> Now, we can continue sailing into the unknown, and probably sink or die of starvation or scurvy, or we can get off in Hawaii.<eos> Let's get off in Hawaii.<eos> - What's so good about Hawaii?<eos> - Have you never been? - No.<eos> - It's very nice.<eos> I think we should take it.<eos> Okay, everything Keenan touches turns to gold, and you... are different than that.
Pour me one, Big Cat!<eos> Jared, there's no pink glasses!<eos> Richard, I know you think I'm a bullshit artist.<eos> It's okay. I totally am.<eos> I have this gift where I can make people do whatever I want 'em to do, and they don't even realize they're doing it. Right.<eos> Richard, you have the greatest technology that I've ever seen.<eos> You can change the fucking world.<eos> You just have to get people excited about it.<eos> That's where I come in.<eos> You and me together, bro?
And they'll never know the difference.<eos> No wonder Mia's in prison.<eos> She's brilliant.<eos> - I think this might actually work.<eos> You don't even know what we've been talking about.<eos> I don't need to, Richard.<eos> The truth is, we've tried and tried.<eos> Every time we've gotten a whiff of success, a giant pelican by the name of Fate takes a four-and-a-half-pound shit right on top of us.<eos> There are people who are destined for greatness and people who are not.<eos> Richard, it seems you and I... are not.

What? Okay? You've gotta go pull all the Pineapples.<eos> What the fuck? Who ratted us out? I don't know.<eos> Probably we'll never know.<eos> It's impossible to tell.<eos> Just go. Go get... get them now.<eos> Just go. Please.<eos> - Bingo.<eos> We've got to split up.<eos> I'll take the food court.<eos> You take the east concourse.
See that number?<eos> That is the number of installs that we've got from Hoolicon alone.<eos> We have moved all of Melcher's data onto a network of mobile devices.<eos> - We did it.<eos> - Do Dinesh and Gilfoyle know? Yeah.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, they know.<eos> Now that this worked, they like me again.<eos> They're off getting churros to celebrate.<eos> I told them that we would meet them at Barker's keynote, so... come on.<eos> Richard, the fact that you think that success justifies all your behavior...
Back up, back up.<eos> Big Head.<eos> Hey, I need you to meet me at the loading dock behind Spilker in 10 minutes.<eos> I'll explain there.<eos> Now's not really a great time, Richard.<eos> I'm sort of in the middle of something.<eos> Wait. You said you already explained.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I did. Yeah, it's just...<eos> Come on, buddy, I need you.
- What are you looking for? - Well, say a... a being with an enormous amount of power.<eos> I'm looking for how someone might, you know, defeat them.<eos> - "The art of killing gods."<eos> You weren't on the poison room?<eos> - Believe me, I wanna get in there.<eos> It's... it's above my pay grade.<eos> - Penny, Silvia. - You really don't need my help?<eos> - With what?<eos> - Trying to break into the poison room.<eos> - I am telling you the truth because you are the one I trust, and I really just need your support right now.
And then I lost it again for good, but I also discovered that I don't have to be like the beast.<eos> With the right help, I can do good.<eos> I just have a chip missing.<eos> - What do you want from me, Julia?<eos> - To be the missing chip.<eos> Tell me when to tap on the brakes.<eos> - Tap?<eos> - Slam on them.<eos> I trust you.<eos> I need you.
- What do you want from me, Julia?<eos> - To be the missing chip.<eos> Tell me when to tap on the brakes.<eos> - Tap?<eos> - Slam on them.<eos> I trust you.<eos> I need you.<eos> Shit.<eos> Okay, we can try it.<eos> The thing is, I think I kind of need you too right now.
- Well, what causes it?<eos> - They don't know, just that it happens soon, like, weeks.<eos> - How is reading your book gonna help?<eos> - Something happens that affects the library, it'll be in a librarian's book, but right now, they're moving all the librarians' books to the poison room, including mine.<eos> The order thinks that once your book is written, your fate is sealed.<eos> - Well, I've never seen a book be wrong. - You?<eos> - No, but I saw them reshelve your book 39 times.<eos> Time loops exist, then I'm team Sarah Connor:<eos> "No fate but what we make."<eos> - Fine, I'll grab your book for you. - I can get it myself.
- You went back to the witches.<eos> - Where is she?<eos> Where's my wife?<eos> - Oh, here and there.<eos> I saved you the biggest piece.<eos> Are you still trying to be a good person?<eos> As if there is such a thing.<eos> Left alone, you would fight and fight against your nature.<eos> And you would waste so much of what you really are.<eos> - If you think doing this is going to turn me into you, you don't understand people at all.
- I should have known.<eos> Where's Julia?<eos> - Why don't you ask me where John is?<eos> - What did you do?<eos> - Nothing he wasn't asking for.<eos> Hated you so much, he begged me to kill him.<eos> - You bitch!<eos> You liar!<eos> - Kady, what...?<eos> - It's you.
It's not easy.<eos> I thought you ended that.<eos> Well, I'm not answering, am I?<eos> And Dayana?<eos> Lydia thinks she's fiercely loyal and acts as the others' enforcer.<eos> You were right.<eos> Lean is a problem, one we'll handle together, if your feelings don't get in the way.<eos> Feelings?<eos> For Lean?<eos> He didn't just betray you.
I'm counting on it.<eos> We're gonna keep walking until the AIC shows themselves.<eos> Come on.<eos> You've constructed this misdirection.<eos> You lot want to know who the terrorists are.<eos> You've goaded them into action for the chance of catching them.<eos> But you're bait.<eos> You'll die.<eos> - Harry.<eos> - I've made a lot of mistakes, including sleeping with you.
Hey, get back here.<eos> I can't find my husband Tony.<eos> He was with me for a second, and then I turned my back, and he was gone.<eos> There was a man next to me, French, gray hair.<eos> He's disappeared, too.<eos> Okay.<eos> Everyone, backs against the walls now!<eos> We need a head count.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You, come with us.

I think I left the work order in my truck.<eos> Why don't you go get it then?<eos> Chen, stay in position.<eos> Doyle, I need backup.<eos> We've lost our jamming signal.<eos> I need someone to run interference here, fast.<eos> Sorry, mate.<eos> I can't leave my desk.<eos> Got a woman watching my every move.<eos> Alex, he's coming up to you.
He had trapped himself in.<eos> There was no way out.<eos> And before I knew what he was doing, he grabbed a knife from the kitchen counter and ran himself through with it.<eos> Well, not once, not twice.<eos> Three times.<eos> I tried to save him.<eos> I did.<eos> But there was so much blood.<eos> Just be true to yourself, Sebastian, whatever that is.<eos> Yeah, there may be sin inside of you, and that's what you treat it, believe it.
Just like you wanted to be, Alex.<eos> The only difference is I had what it takes.<eos> And what is that?<eos> To create a hostage crisis?<eos> What we tried to do with the G-20?<eos> Sure, some people would've died, but in the long run, we would've saved many more lives, and instead, how many of us are dead?<eos> People who've given their lives in service to this country, true patriots, picked off like roaches in a kitchen.<eos> No one needed to die, and you are not a patriot.<eos> Anyone who thinks they can take the law into their own hands is nothing but a terrorist.<eos> Except when it's you, right, Alex?

I love you.<eos> This doesn't change any of that.<eos> You want to come with me, we can escape together.<eos> If you want to save him...<eos> This is interesting.<eos> She's lying to you, Sebastian.<eos> She was not a senator's aide.<eos> She never was.<eos> She's CIA.<eos> She's a rogue operative, and she only married you for cover.

I let him be who he wants to be, unlike you.<eos> Give me Will, or this is it.<eos> Three.<eos> - Sebastian.<eos> - Two.<eos> Please, just... just drop the gun and we can talk.<eos> To hell with this.<eos> Sebastian!<eos> They kicked you out?<eos> Yeah, thanks to you.
I'm relieved.<eos> I don't want to kill anybody ever again, not for them, not for my country.<eos> I follow orders.<eos> You don't.<eos> That's why you're leaving and I'm not.<eos> What did they do to you?<eos> I was lost.<eos> They found me.<eos> They brainwashed you, just like you were brainwashed as a child.<eos> You know, I care about you, Dayana.
Ryan, you're not working for the FBI anymore.<eos> You're working for her.<eos> And who are you working for?<eos> Want a drink?<eos> Can't.<eos> I leave tonight.<eos> Next time you want to see me, maybe try e-mail instead of attempting suicide.<eos> So you're just gonna...<eos> Do my job?<eos> Unlike you for much longer.
I used to think so.<eos> But whatever you are, whomever you are, you're a stranger to me, and you don't belong here.<eos> Sebastian, can you feel the ground?<eos> - Are you steady? - No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Unless we're condemning him to die, we need to keep moving.<eos> Faster now!<eos> Come on, come on, come on, come on.<eos> Hey, hey, where's Will?<eos> I can't find him.<eos> - I thought he was with you.
It's Alison's - mystery man again.<eos> Honey, don't you think maybe we should be turning that off?<eos> ♪ To say that beat your heart ♪<eos> - I have to get the raffle tickets.<eos> - Wait-wait-wait. Uhh... wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> What about the buddy system? - No, no. I'm fine.<eos> I'm fine. - Okay.<eos> Oh, Christmas.<eos> I have neighbours. I... I know.<eos> - You're the other one.
Chain yourself to your sister today.<eos> Donnie, I'm not in the mood for the Church Fall Fun Fairl.<eos> Not with Nona Walker in charge! Honey, we are still the entertainment.<eos> I am doing my dance, and we are singing our duet, right?<eos> Okay. Honey, come on.<eos> What is the Fall Fun Fair without Team Hendrix?<eos> I can't stop thinking about M.K. and Cosima out there all alone.<eos> Why do I love my sisters so much when they're ruined my life.<eos> Hey, your life isn't ruined.<eos> It's just waiting for you to come back and sparkle it up.
Aldous was so proud when he published this book, and yet, P.T. Westmoreland told me he wrote it.<eos> And Aldous just dumbed it down.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> Well, the imaging alone shows the foetus had a rapid - and unexplained recovery.<eos> - Yes, Helena's children could prove even more vital than Kira.<eos> Donnie Hendrix may be holding back regarding Helena.<eos> Well, we have more persuasive leverage, don't we?<eos> I'll instruct the detectives.<eos> Detective Bell, what's going on?<eos> You tell me.
No law says you have to stick around.<eos> Are we cool, Donnie?<eos> Yeah, we're cool.<eos> Just... keep 'em out of the garage.<eos> Do you remember your car accident, Kira?<eos> Yeah. Ms. S said it was a miracle.<eos> What if I told you it might not be a miracle at all. Might actually be something in your genes.<eos> That's what Auntie Cosima thinks.<eos> Yes, she would.<eos> I have a present for you.
Just Neo police searching our house.<eos> - What? ! Police?<eos> - Yeah. - Why?<eos> - They're trying to tie us - to Pouchy.<eos> - Ugh! Well, there's no evidence tying us to Pouchy, is there?<eos> No, but there are a few bodies buried in our garage.<eos> What do you think happens when Rachel discovers that I killed Leekie?<eos> Well, I didn't shoot him in the face, did I?<eos> No, you only let Aynsley Norris strangle to death.<eos> I thought she was my monitor, and that turned out to be you!
Yeah. Yeah, I used to do a lot of things, huh?<eos> Hey, are you Okay?<eos> There's something I should have told you about Aynsley's death.<eos> Oh, look, you don't have to say anything.<eos> - It's fine. - No, you have to hear me.<eos> It was my fault.<eos> I shouldn't have said anything back there.<eos> I'm sorry, that was stupid.<eos> You guys had your problems, Okay, but those were... those were best friend problems.<eos> But, God, she loved you.
Look, Rachel can't know what's in there. - Okay? You have to stall 'em.<eos> - Stall 'em?<eos> Girl, we're halfway to China over there.<eos> Who's even in there anyway?<eos> No, no, no. S got rid of that body.<eos> Do you think she would bury him in the Hendrix garage?<eos> Then who is it?<eos> Sarah, I have lost my line right now.<eos> I need to know.<eos> It's bad, but not for you.
Aldous Leekie is buried in your garage?<eos> Minus the head which was donated to science.<eos> For most of my life, I hated Aldous.<eos> But I chose not to kill him.<eos> The other body, who is it?<eos> A Castor.<eos> Tell me Helena's location, and this all goes away.<eos> Even if I knew where she was, I wouldn't tell you.<eos> This isn't our problem, it's yours.<eos> So go ahead, file murder charges against us. It all leads back to you and your office.
- Enger.<eos> - It's Rachel.<eos> Something's come up on my end.<eos> I need to know what you found, Detective.<eos> Ma'am, there's a body here, but, um, we can't ID it just yet.<eos> What, uh, what would you like us to do?<eos> Well, dispose of the bodies discreetly and put the garage back in order.<eos> Okay. We'll stand down.<eos> Looks like the Hendrixes squirmed out of this one.<eos> What would you have me do with you now?
You okay?<eos> Eat up.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You're gonna need your energy.<eos> And that was the first con.<eos> First of many.<eos> You know, you could have just become an actress.<eos> Not the same thing.<eos> I was kidding.<eos> I don't really care anymore about how you became you.
Bride or groom?<eos> Great.<eos> Gift room's just over there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Bride or groom?<eos> - Definitely groom.<eos> - If that's a present, the gift room is just over... nope.<eos> So, how we doing?<eos> - I'm amazing.<eos> - I'm guessing this has to be pretty messed up for you.

- No, don't to...<eos> - Just don't touch it!<eos> - All right, I just wanna help you get it to the...<eos> Okay, are you sure that you have to throw this out?<eos> - I mean, maybe we can...<eos> - I don't want to talk about it!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> So what...<eos> so does destroying your art...<eos> What, does it like disqualify me from being with you again?
Maybe.<eos> Or maybe not.<eos> So what is it?<eos> We weren't supposed to leave the reception until after 2:00.<eos> That was the plan.<eos> I know.<eos> How you doing, Ez?<eos> That's it?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> You?
- for Seniors Bingo.<eos> - Seniors Bingo.<eos> Got it!<eos> Just get to the highway interchange.<eos> Seattle PD's looking for his car.<eos> They're gonna let us know which way to go.<eos> Damn weddings.<eos> What's that?<eos> Hello, Patrick.<eos> This must be very confusing for you.
Real slow now.<eos> License and registration.<eos> Everything all right, officer?<eos> Sorry there, sir.<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> I most certainly will.<eos> Hey, have you seen a woman in a wedding dress?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Are one of you cuties the groom?<eos> You know, I used to think we were the same, you and I, in a way.

I took.
I am not going to stick my head into the lion's den.<eos> Then who will?<eos> Speak up.<eos> Mr. Romeo...<eos> Excellent idea!<eos> How are you, brother?<eos> This is the first time you've ever checked in on me.<eos> Must be something very important.<eos> No...<eos> I thought I'd have a drink with you today.
Are you crazy?<eos> If father does send a proposal... and Vaidehi refuses then father will hang us all.<eos> I will handle everything, just talk to him.<eos> I don't want to listen to you.<eos> Brother..<eos> Listen...<eos> If he's insisting so much, why don't you try talking to him once?<eos> Fine, I'll talk to him.<eos> Wow, brother, you've been listening to Urmila these days.<eos> Because she is smart and not stupid like you.

Sarcasm won't change our decision, papa.<eos> It's a really nice family.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I don't want to get married.<eos> And why don't you think about Kritika, she's elder to me.<eos> You didn't think about her... when you squandered away all the money.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> No, I am not okay.<eos> I've been trying really hard... to get this burden off my chest. But it's in no mood to budge an inch.<eos> Don't get angry, papa... you will only ruin your health.
Do you have any idea that the oil-wells around the world are drying up? Show some mercy.<eos> Then stop rubbing so much oil on your hair... and it won't dry so soon.<eos> That's not oil, it's a styling gel.<eos> Hello, Kritika.<eos> I will set your dreams ablaze.<eos> Focus on my girl.<eos> I can clearly understand all this drama you're up to.<eos> What did I do?<eos> knew your intention wasn't good... right from the wedding function.<eos> If my intentions weren't good, I would've made you my girlfriend... and not proposed to marry you.

Right, sister?
Let's stop discussing about girlfriend-boyfriend... and talk about marriage instead.<eos> I don't want to get married?<eos> Do I have to tattoo that on my arm for you to understand?<eos> Is he bothering you?<eos> Does it look like I am bothering her?<eos> Don't try to be a hero.<eos> Look... Listen.<eos> Yes.<eos> I don't want to get married, okay?<eos> Not with you, or any other boy or girl. Okay?
I can understand that you're in shock.<eos> But I am stilling willing to marry you.<eos> You're shameless.<eos> My elder sister is still unmarried... and you're dreaming about the younger one.<eos> I will get her married too.<eos> I am ready to marry you.<eos> We can all get married at the same venue.<eos> I would rather commit suicide than marry you.<eos> Hey man, stop bothering her...<eos> Sit down or I will punch the daylights out of you.
I am his son after all, why will he throw me out?<eos> Come here.<eos> If you get me pregnant before our wedding... won't he throw you out?<eos> Don't you see she's bothering me now! Badri.<eos> You're glued to your seat. Huh!<eos> Badri, I guess the stars are not in your favor today.<eos> Let's go. We'll talk to her tomorrow. Come on.<eos> You've mentally disturbed today, something's wrong with her. I will come back tomorrow.<eos> You can't graduate in a single day.<eos> I am a really nice guy, and I will take good care of you.
They've built another Taj Mahal here.<eos> There are seven wonders of the world right here... and you only know about the Taj Mahal?<eos> Did you call me here to teach me Geography?<eos> You're looking really smart today.<eos> You should marry Kritika.<eos> Have you lost it?<eos> She's much better looking and qualified than me.<eos> And she's a Trivedi as well.<eos> If tomorrow you call your dog 'Sweety Trivedi'... will I have to marry her too?<eos> I want to marry you.
I'm still a bachelor.<eos> But with the grace of Goddess... maybe I will find a life-partner soon.<eos> Because the Goddess has a big heart.<eos> Sing with me, Glory to the Benevolent One!<eos> Glory to Her!<eos> Bhushan, I need to speak with you.<eos> Let's talk after the program.<eos> We must talk right now.<eos> You see, father takes all the bookings for the programs.<eos> Well, actually I want to book you... for marriage.
What you're doing is not right, Badri.<eos> You won't get away with this.<eos> If the police catch you, they will throw you behind bars.<eos> Please...<eos> Listen to me, Badri... please!<eos> Don't try to threaten me.<eos> I am not afraid of the law.<eos> I will kill you right here... and I don't even care if they hang me for it.<eos> Why did you do it?<eos> I did everything I could for you.
Please...<eos> Listen to me, Badri... please!<eos> Don't try to threaten me.<eos> I am not afraid of the law.<eos> I will kill you right here... and I don't even care if they hang me for it.<eos> Why did you do it?<eos> I did everything I could for you.<eos> And you deceived me..<eos> I never mistreated or misbehaved with you.<eos> I literally went out on a hand and limb for you and your family.

You were really cunning.<eos> Taking advantage of me to get your sister married. And disappeared in thin air.<eos> Badri, you were helping me for your own intentions... it wasn't some charity..<eos> I was.<eos> But I was doing a good thing.<eos> I didn't hurt anyone.<eos> What good did you do by lying?<eos> What did I lie about?<eos> Badri, I know.<eos> You arranged for that money.
Badri, I know.<eos> You arranged for that money.<eos> Who told you?<eos> No one has to tell me... because I know what kind of people they...<eos> I don't care what they think!<eos> But it was a blessing for you, wasn't it?<eos> Where ever the money came from... how does it make a difference to you?<eos> It does make a difference, Badri!<eos> Why are they putting a price on me?<eos> Did I put a price on you?
But it was a blessing for you, wasn't it?<eos> Where ever the money came from... how does it make a difference to you?<eos> It does make a difference, Badri!<eos> Why are they putting a price on me?<eos> Did I put a price on you?<eos> But.. I put a price on you, Vaidehi?<eos> But you didn't stop your father either. Did you?<eos> So you're punishing me for his mistakes.<eos> Badri...<eos> I didn't run away because of you.
Then get some ointment for it, but shut up.<eos> I won't.<eos> You gave Jhansi a bad reputation.<eos> This is my last warning, shut up.<eos> Last warning?<eos> Yes, last...<eos> What do you want? I said shut up!<eos> Shut up!<eos> She abandoned you on your wedding.<eos> Now she's right in front of you... but you're helpless.
Just call her.<eos> Badri.<eos> Vaidehi...<eos> Badri, get down.<eos> Sir sorry... sorry.<eos> He's my friend... my friend.<eos> Badri... come.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> My father will get me married to someone else.<eos> I want to marry only you... why don't you get it?
Your BP will shoot up.<eos> It's my last warning, you will regret it.<eos> I am saying sorry, why don't you get it?<eos> Hey...<eos> I've been trying to apologize... and your just sulking<eos> Try to understand.<eos> You...<eos> I was your best friend.<eos> Weren't you ashamed of slapping me?<eos> I came all the way to Singapore for you.
I don't know what to do?<eos> I'll explain you.<eos> Come on.<eos> Why are you laughing?<eos> Come on.<eos> Come, I will tell you.<eos> Badri...<eos> Badri, 150,000 rupees man!<eos> Make me an air-hostess as well.<eos> You won't look good in a skirt.
And right now he doesn't respect me, neither do I respect him.<eos> So what should I do?<eos> Hello...<eos> Will I have to do everything.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> I'm just kidding<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Gurmeet.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Excuse me, who are you?
Badri, listen.<eos> If there was anyone else in my life... I would've told you.<eos> There is no one!<eos> Now...<eos> let's go home.<eos> What's wrong, Badri?<eos> Say something.<eos> I don't get it!<eos> What kind of a man have I turned into?<eos> Being aggressive with you... beating up people.
Jump.<eos> Jump!<eos> Good job.<eos> What happened, Badri? Why are you sad?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Missing your mom?<eos> No... my Sister-in-law.<eos> Looking at you, I realized that... even she could have achieved a lot.<eos> Honestly, Vaidehi.<eos> Kritika would've been really proud to see you like this.
How are you?<eos> Kritika!<eos> Kritika, sorry.<eos> Stop wasting your time apologizing.<eos> We're talking after such a long time.<eos> Where are you?<eos> London... with Bhushan.<eos> We're here for a function.<eos> Wow... you're in London.<eos> Even you made it to Singapore.
Where are you?<eos> London... with Bhushan.<eos> We're here for a function.<eos> Wow... you're in London.<eos> Even you made it to Singapore.<eos> Vaidehi.<eos> Vaidehi, It's Bhushan...<eos> Hello, Bhushan... how are you?<eos> I am fine...<eos> You and Badri have cheated me... you told me that she is naive and innocent.
What for?<eos> You know, since I was a kid...<eos> I always wanted to be their son.<eos> But I could never succeed.<eos> And when I got the job, I called home.<eos> I wanted to tell my father that I got a job.<eos> But he didn't talk to me.<eos> And I thought... that people like my father will never change.<eos> But even after what happened between us... we are sitting together here today... up high in Singapore.<eos> And it's all because of you.
You want to hit me, don't you?<eos> If you want to hit me, hit me harder... harder...<eos> - Stop it, Badri! Badri!<eos> I miss her!<eos> I love her!<eos> I see her everywhere I look.<eos> Here... there... there...<eos> Why have you come here?<eos> Who just appears like this...<eos> This is not the right place for you... I am not the right guy for you.
Why have you come here?<eos> Who just appears like this...<eos> This is not the right place for you... I am not the right guy for you.<eos> Go back to Singapore...<eos> You see... the stressful situation of my sudden appearance... is making your heart beat faster.<eos> You're blabbering...<eos> So tie your seatbelt... and breath slowly.<eos> Because if something happens to you... then I will have to marry someone else.<eos> Which I can't.<eos> Because I want to marry you.
But I was wrong...<eos> Absolutely wrong.<eos> I really love Badri, papa.<eos> And only I will be Badri's bride.<eos> What?<eos> I will be Vaidehi's groom.<eos> She will work in Singapore.<eos> And I am with her.<eos> If you understand, then good...<eos> If you don't... then may the Lord bless you.
Okay, only six more days till you, me, Andi and Marcy are on a plane to Vegas.
The one that calls you "toots"?<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> He's the one who's got the head that's too big for his body.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, Bubblehead Thompson, yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just... I hope Teddy's not upset.<eos> Oh, well, let's find out.<eos> I don't suggest this often, but let's go talk to our children.<eos> Okay, you go.<eos> Why don't you go?
And then, a cheerleader from the other school saw me in my Eddie Murphy suit and she flipped her little ponytail at me and she said,<eos> "Oh, hey, look, it's... "<eos> - Sweaty Murphy.<eos> - Sweaty Murphy.<eos> What?<eos> But how did you know that?<eos> Wait a minute, wait a minute.<eos> You're Sweaty Murphy?<eos> I played in that game.<eos> We talked about you in the huddle.
Oh!<eos> And you're the girl in the suit, this is so funny!<eos> You don't think it's funny.<eos> Well, I'm just glad you're okay, because word on the street was that Sweaty Murphy went crazy and ended up in a home somewhere.<eos> Yeah, my home.<eos> I can't believe I married Sweaty Murphy!<eos> It's not funny.<eos> It's a little funny.<eos> Funny.<eos> I can't believe we have been friends all these years and that was you.
The one you're talking about, she's never done.<eos> Well, we got to figure out a way to talk her into it.<eos> Yeah, I'll be fine.<eos> You know, it's been so long, I don't even miss it anymore.<eos> Oh, you mean the other thing.<eos> You want me to apologize?<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> Adam, you know I love Andi.<eos> She's one of my best friends, but she totally overreacted.<eos> All right, between you and me,

Oh, and when you do it, if she starts talking in Portuguese, just power through, that's all compliments.<eos> There she is.<eos> Surprise!<eos> Look who came to see you.<eos> Hello, Marcy.<eos> That was in English, that's a good sign.<eos> So, Andi, I just wanted to say...<eos> Oh, you know what? Nothing you say can change what happened.<eos> All right?<eos> I mean, all these years, I have regretted not thinking of the perfect comeback for when you called me "Sweaty Murphy"... but I see now that I'm not small and mean like you.
Honey, Marcy came over to apologize.<eos> No, no, I am not apologizing anymore.<eos> She's completely overreacting again.<eos> Overreact... uh.<eos> A-Are you hearing this?<eos> Do you think I'm overreacting?<eos> Me?<eos> Uh... do I think you're overreacting?<eos> She's looking right at you.<eos> Everyone in the room knows she's talking to you.
Uh... do I think you're overreacting?<eos> She's looking right at you.<eos> Everyone in the room knows she's talking to you.<eos> Adam?<eos> Well, you are reacting.<eos> And it's definitely not too little.<eos> It's... well, there's underreacting.<eos> Right?<eos> Then there's regular reacting. You know.<eos> Then there's, uh... you.
Have you ever been so desperate to get out of a leather suit that you broke the zipper?<eos> And then your dad had to cut you out with an electric carving knife?<eos> Okay.<eos> To be fair, that's a really small club.<eos> You know, now that I think about it,<eos> Adam sailed through high school.<eos> He was always the winner, always popular.<eos> Okay. Look, I can't help it if people are drawn to me.<eos> I'm... magnetic. I don't know.<eos> Life's been easy for you, hasn't it?
I mean, people called me Sweaty Murphy for months.<eos> All right?<eos> Even my homeroom teacher.<eos> She'd do roll call in the morning, she'd be, like,<eos> "Murphy," comma, "Sweaty?"<eos> And I'd have to be, like, "Here."<eos> Oh.<eos> Okay.<eos> I didn't know any of that.<eos> I think it's time you leave, Adam.
He's 11.<eos> And there's a naked lady on his iPad?<eos> That's not so bad...<eos> it's just the top half.<eos> God, I can't believe Teddy's going online and looking at pictures of naked women.<eos> And then leaving the computer out.<eos> Rookie mistake.<eos> That doesn't sound like him.<eos> Wait a minute...<eos> Was this you?
Even when it's bad... it's good.<eos> Can we stop talking now?<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Why do you have Teddy's iPad?<eos> Well, because there are some very interesting pictures on it.<eos> Why are you telling me?<eos> I never had it.<eos> Oh, well, he says you did.<eos> Hey, let's go question him together.<eos> I'll be the good cop, and, you, you be the cop that lies about being on the iPad.
Okay, but, you know, then I thought I would just wait for a natural time, when she'd say something.<eos> And-and then, you know, I'd say,<eos> "Hey, it's funny you should bring that up."<eos> But that never happened.<eos> And then, one day, I got a, you know, a permission slip for a special health class.<eos> So, you know, I just... let it ride.<eos> - Let it ride. - Yeah.<eos> Did not know that was an option, Mrs. Pants On Fire!<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> You are not mad because I lied... you're mad because I figured out a way to get out of this and you couldn't.

- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Look who's back from the flooring expo.<eos> How many free burritos did you sneak out with this time?<eos> Six.<eos> I'm so happy I'll be sealed inside this tin can with you all day.
Um, generally, when these big companies hear pitches, they're expecting a multimedia presentation.<eos> Animation, 3D models.<eos> And I'd be happy to help if you want.<eos> - That sounds great.<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> Why are you getting your back up?<eos> Because I got the meeting, and I'll close the deal.<eos> It's what I've done since we started.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, this dip has upset my stomach, and I would like to be at home.<eos> Well, if it made you sick, why are you taking it with you?
- that word-of-the-day calendar? - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he's got this theory that his brain is like his stomach.<eos> Every new thing he takes in pushes an old thing out.<eos> I've got to make room in Don's brain for Lowell's ideas.<eos> Well...<eos> I'm just excited that you got along with Lowell.<eos> Did you tell him how much fun you had hanging out with him?<eos> Men don't do stuff like that.<eos> It's from Lowell.<eos> "I had so much fun hanging out with you."
Will you stop trying to make me do weird things with other men?<eos> That's what she said.<eos> Come on, that was solid.<eos> But I should write Lowell back.<eos> He is offering to help me.<eos> Uh, well, you do it.<eos> I'm bad at these.<eos> Just say something breezy, yet manly.<eos> Oh, fun.<eos> Okay, "Great hanging out with you, too.
- Well, to be honest...<eos> - Don't answer.<eos> I just want to ride this rainbow.<eos> Wow! Our names just exploded out of that house!<eos> Nice job.<eos> I love it.<eos> I didn't make it, Lowell did.<eos> I hate it.<eos> What is your problem?<eos> Our business is just you and me.
But I forbade it.<eos> Well, I think you were wrong.<eos> Should we vote on it?<eos> How're you gonna vote on it, there's only the...<eos> Don't-Don't-Don't even.<eos> Look, you're being pigheaded.<eos> Just take a look at it.<eos> No. I've seen all I need to see.<eos> Here's what's gonna happen:<eos> I'm gonna do the presentation to Lisa McCaffrey on my own, without you or your new best friend.
Oh, really?<eos> So, you're gonna be so stubborn that you ruin it for both of us?<eos> And if you want a meeting with her, you can go guac her taco on your own time.<eos> Okay, the headline is I'm your new best friend.<eos> Wow, that sounds like a real overreaction, even for Don.<eos> He is stubborn like a mule.<eos> Also like a mule, you can't walk up behind him or he'll kick you.<eos> Uh-huh, so there are two mules in this fight.<eos> Wait, why am I a mule?<eos> Oh, please, I have had many a fight with you, my friend.
Uh-huh, so there are two mules in this fight.<eos> Wait, why am I a mule?<eos> Oh, please, I have had many a fight with you, my friend.<eos> What, you're telling me that you change your mind when you hear a good argument for the other point of view?<eos> Well, I'll let you know when I hear one.<eos> Look, obviously for Don, this is about more than getting a job.<eos> I mean, sometimes things seem like they're about one thing, but they're really about something else.<eos> - You think?<eos> - Yeah. Like...<eos> Mrs. Rodriguez had a sex dream about you.
I-I-I think what Adam is saying is he never knew you felt that way.<eos> I'm the older brother.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Okay, um,<eos> I-I-I think what Don is saying is that traditionally, he would be the leader in your relationship.<eos> Okay, he may be older, but he's a big baby.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um, I think what-what Adam is saying is that sometimes he feels like you don't do what's best for the business, like an equal partner.<eos> He's never treated me like an equal partner.<eos> You only asked me to start the business with you because you felt sorry for me.

Yeah, I read that stupid word-of-the-day calendar.<eos> Thanks to you, I forgot 365 perfectly good words.<eos> Look, without you, Burns Brothers would be nothing.<eos> I can't talk to people and close deals like you can.<eos> You're our secret weapon.<eos> You bet your ass I am.<eos> And when you liked Lowell's thing,<eos> I thought you were trying to find someone to replace me.<eos> You're my brother.<eos> I couldn't get rid of you even if I wanted to.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah, but the mini-mall she's building is going to Burns Brothers Construction.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> That's amazing.<eos> Yeah, that nephew's gonna have a hard time building houses when he keeps finding pudding in his gloves.<eos> And guess who's gonna build a website for these guys?<eos> Me. You don't have to guess, I just wanted to say it.<eos> Yeah, and none of it would've happened if you hadn't put us together with Lowell, and put me and Don back together.<eos> So... thanks for not staying out of stuff.<eos> Aw. Pleasure doing business with you.
- Hmm.<eos> And because she told me to.<eos> Really doing it up fancy, huh?<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah.<eos> I called three weeks ago to get us in at Staiano's for dinner and dancing, pre-ordered their special lovers package for two, and had the truck detailed for when she throws herself at me - on the way home. - Hmm.<eos> I forgot nothing.<eos> - Who's babysitting tonight?<eos> - I forgot something.<eos> Oh, this is not good, I don't have a babysitter.<eos> Wha... hey, are you and Marcy doing anything special tonight?
This could change our lives.<eos> One thing though, if I babysit, it's gonna cost you three dollars an hour.<eos> Three dollars an hour?<eos> Katie, honey... that's not how you negotiate, okay?<eos> You go high, I go low.<eos> Start at, like, ten or $15.<eos> Okay.<eos> $15, then.<eos> No, no, no, no, it's three, you already said three.<eos> Whoa, look at you.

No, that's a, uh, uh, an alarm that I set for myself to remind me to tell you that I love you.<eos> Oh...<eos> I love you, I got to go.<eos> Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Go where?<eos> Babe, a love like ours is beyond questions.<eos> Listen, what's so hard about getting a name on a glass?<eos> I'm begging you, find a Sharpie and get it done.<eos> Katie called again, I got to call her back.<eos> Okay, I'll stand in front of you so Andi can't see.
I-I accidently parked in a loading zone.<eos> Okay, but I got to find a strong drink for Marcy first.<eos> She's starting to get suspicious.<eos> Really?<eos> You having a hard time outsmarting her, are you?<eos> Oh, always.<eos> Oh, this drink looks good.<eos> It's called a Mind Eraser.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mom must've had a few of those when she was pregnant with you.
Yeah.<eos> Mom must've had a few of those when she was pregnant with you.<eos> Okay!<eos> I'm here.<eos> I'm here!<eos> Hello?<eos> Oh, it's okay,<eos> I got him to fly out the window.<eos> Really?<eos> Oh, I'm so proud of you.
I'm disappointed.<eos> We're all disappointed.<eos> Well, clearly Kate's bossy enough to babysit.<eos> I'm sorry, honey.<eos> I really wanted this to be a special night for you.<eos> Well, I mean, you know, we got covered in drinks, covered in glitter and detained by the police.<eos> Before we had kids, we would've called that a pretty fun night.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And it's not over yet.<eos> I still have one more Valentine's Day gift for you.
Huh? And a little bit of that.<eos> That's not how you do it.<eos> Okay, and you can't just make a unilateral decision.<eos> We discuss things in this family.<eos> Well, yes, usually, but, you know, I knew you'd say no, and then, I'd veto your no, so then I just thought, hey, why not just cut out the middle man?<eos> Okay, well, first of all I'm not the middle man.<eos> Okay?<eos> I am the man.<eos> And second of all, if you're going to unilaterally decide she can go, then I'm going to unilaterally decide that your decision is caca.<eos> Oh, don't you remember Romeo and Juliet?

Well, don't you remember those Taken movies?
Hit me with it.<eos> A dirt bike.<eos> Why would you get Marcy a dirt bike?<eos> Ah. Because secretly, I want a dirt bike.<eos> Do you see where I'm going with this?<eos> - Ah? Yeah, uh, may I suggest jewelry?<eos> I don't wear much jewelry.<eos> For Marcy!<eos> - Oh. - Let-Let's think about her.<eos> What does Marcy mean to you?
He is gonna break her heart, and I'm not gonna sit back and watch it happen.<eos> Okay but you can't just go out on your own and start cyber-stalking a 13-year-old.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> It sounds to me like you wish we had discussed it first.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I knew you'd say no, and then I'd veto your no, so I thought, hey, why not cut out the middle man?<eos> Yeah, it doesn't feel good, does it?<eos> Okay, first of all, I am not the middle man.<eos> I'm the wife.<eos> Which means I can stay mad a lot longer than you can.
And he cancelled their date.<eos> You can't prove the connection.<eos> Okay, well, good job, Adam, because your daughter is heartbroken.<eos> You did the exact thing to her that you said Royce would do.<eos> Yeah, but she thinks he did it.<eos> So I say now we do your thing and just stay out of it.<eos> Okay? I mean, we don't want to Romeo and Juliet this sucker.<eos> No, Adam, she blames herself.<eos> She thinks there's something wrong with her.<eos> She doesn't know that really there's just something very, very wrong with you.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> - Say that into my phone.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> Come on. How are we gonna fix this?<eos> Well... it's simple.<eos> We are gonna make the decision, together... to go down to the mall and... bag a teenage boy to date our daughter.<eos> Fine, I'll do it.<eos> But I still think he's a player.<eos> He's not a player.<eos> And I have news for you, you are not a player anymore, either... you are a dad.
Okay.<eos> Bottom line, Katie likes you and you like her, so... please take her out.<eos> But you threatened to bury me in the woods.<eos> You did what?<eos> He's paraphrasing.<eos> That's why I cancelled.<eos> I would never come between a father and a daughter.<eos> Oh, God, this kid is great.<eos> Are you buying this crap?<eos> He's playing you.
I'm out of here.<eos> Listen to me, you... poofy-haired little rat.<eos> Get him, babe.<eos> I know where you live, and I know where you work, and if you ever come near our daughter again, I will come to the end of your rainbow and I will kick you right in the tots.<eos> A little free advice:<eos> never be afraid of the crazy one, be afraid of the one the crazy one's afraid of.<eos> Whew! - You know what? - Hmm?<eos> That was fun.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I like doing stuff with you.
Mm-hmm, yeah, and that's when we met Daphne.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I can't believe you guys would do that.<eos> That's-that's my personal life.<eos> Oh, Katie, you're right, we didn't respect your boundaries.<eos> And we never will.<eos> Yeah, it turns out that the lesson from Romeo and Juliet is that the parents just weren't strict enough.<eos> This is the worst apology ever.<eos> Oh, no, no, it's not an apology.<eos> No, no, it's a warning to any future boy that tries to date you.

You know, s-she'll make us pay for this when we're old.<eos> Yeah.<eos> When the time comes, that one is gonna be quick to pull the plug.<eos> I can't believe Marcy got you a dirt bike for your anniversary.<eos> And that she can bring it in here, but I had to leave my beer in the hall.<eos> It was the perfect place to hide it last night because I knew Don wouldn't dare come in this room.<eos> If you got Marcy another fast food gift card, I suggest you ride off on this thing right now.<eos> Oh, no, no, I love my girl.<eos> In fact, I got her something very special.<eos> - Here you go, baby. - Oh!
I'd like to take it.<eos> I'm-I'm-I'm drowning in worthless Intel on Javier Garcia.<eos> I cannot connect him to laundering money for the cartels.<eos> I know, sir.<eos> I got two dozen agents working day and night to try to find a chink in his armor.<eos> Timing could be better, but you've been in D.C.<eos> Dealing with the case of my career-- and it's supposed to be yours, too.<eos> Look, I'm not asking for an immediate transfer.<eos> I'm going to see this case through.<eos> Tammy, I've invested in you.
Oh... good idea.<eos> But only two glasses?<eos> Oh, uh, I can't stay.<eos> I'm already late for a-- a board meeting for the family trust.<eos> Tonight?<eos> I mean, even after everything you've been through?<eos> Duty calls.<eos> I'm sure you understand, Dwayne.<eos> Of course.<eos> Maybe I should come with you.
He's dead.<eos> Tammy's back at FBI.<eos> But she was in trouble.<eos> All right, and I-- I could've helped her, but I froze up, I was a-afraid of missing the shot.<eos> Which is why you didn't take it.<eos> I'm not ready to be a field agent.<eos> Of course not.<eos> That's what training is for.<eos> Don't ever give up.<eos> All right, but keep doing what you do best, because right now, we need you.
I always thought I had some kind of... god-level good luck.<eos> True, you've only used it instinctively, but I'm here now.<eos> I can teach you how to use it at will.<eos> Easy.<eos> And once you've mastered it, that's how you get Cowden's vote.<eos> I don't know that I want to do that.<eos> - It feels like cheating.<eos> - They all don't cheat?<eos> Everyone uses whatever they've got, John, and the bad ones don't hesitate.<eos> So someone like you, someone who wants to do some actual good in the world, how can you not?
He moved on.<eos> Uh, who's your friend, and what's his shoe size?<eos> Uh, we're not really here to bowl.<eos> Kid, the first rule of being dead, if you're here, ya bowl.<eos> We're actually not dead, either.<eos> Uh, we're here because we need your help.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> It's--it's good to see you, Richard.<eos> - I mean, the real you.
John, I'm sorry but I think you're overestimating yourself, here.<eos> No, honey, I'm being 100% literal.<eos> I am not human, Cindy.<eos> And I know it sounds ridiculous, but it is true.<eos> Okay...<eos> I think that you have been working too hard--<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> I haven't.<eos> I am telling you the truth.<eos> Because you are the one I trust.
I think that you have been working too hard--<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> I haven't.<eos> I am telling you the truth.<eos> Because you are the one I trust.<eos> You are the only one, really.<eos> And I really just need your support right now, babe.<eos> Of course, honey.<eos> I apologize.<eos> I know that you always find a way to do the right thing, and I am here for you.
Only that whatever it is, it is increasing.<eos> Idri's turned into a rat, so it isn't the Lorians.<eos> We've incapacitated the FU Fighters.<eos> That leaves... the people in this room.<eos> Your Highness?<eos> If anyone has anything to say...<eos> I'm embezzling funds from the royal treasury.<eos> - Why did I just say that? - Hah!<eos> Because there's truth serum in this wine.<eos> I've truthied you.
The "S" stands for Shot, or maybe it's Schiff.<eos> Let me know if you find anything gross in her book.<eos> I have a feeling she's a total freak in the sack.<eos> Okay.<eos> What's your deal?<eos> - I have no deal.<eos> - You're a child.<eos> Okay, Grandpa, that's a little--<eos> What are you even doing stuck here?<eos> What do they have on you?
- Like, he's a--<eos> - Legitimate businessman.<eos> Can we please not talk about it?<eos> My God, you're like that whiny little kid in "The Sopranos," Willow.<eos> Jesus Christ, you are so lame.<eos> Please.<eos> And her name was Meadow.<eos> You truthied me?<eos> I can't lie.<eos> Eliot, I did this for you.
It's me.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Julia, I found her she's...<eos> Quentin.<eos> I missed you so much.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Hi.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Are you?
Julia, I found her she's...<eos> Quentin.<eos> I missed you so much.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Hi.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Are you?<eos> Not really.<eos> Without you.
I know it's a lot, but it's worth it.<eos> My wife.<eos> Is anything about our relationship real?<eos> I've been controlling her from the day we met, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Lucky her.<eos> How is that?<eos> She's a person.<eos> Yes.<eos> And you're not.
It's not surprising, you're my son, how else could it be but her?<eos> The benevolent "Our Lady Underground."<eos> It is all about her.<eos> Power, attention, grinding men and gods into the fucking dirt and then she leaves!<eos> You loved her.<eos> Guess there's some things you can't control, after all.<eos> I can see you're upset.<eos> But I need you to move past that.<eos> Stop worrying about humans.<eos> They're beneath you.
Kady.<eos> Kady!<eos> Kady, wake up.<eos> - Kady. - Hey.<eos> - What?<eos> - Hey, you, uh, you got a guest.<eos> Professor Lipson told me to bring him here.<eos> If you're still after Reynard, I want in.<eos> Eliot?<eos> Oh, you.
It's who I couldn't make the math work.<eos> What math?<eos> Uh, the spell to bring Alice back.<eos> I knew something was missing, I just didn't know...<eos> It was me.<eos> You have to go now.<eos> There's a portal in there, back to reception.<eos> And I'm glad we got to say good-bye.<eos> Um, I'm gonna be back here for good one day, and I am going to find you.<eos> You first.
Now, if I go down there with just Donovan, I'm gonna look like a no-name hustler.<eos> - Gosh darn it. - Should I go out now, and try to find new clients, or should I concentrate on the one client that I have left?<eos> You know, they're probably sniffing around Donovan as we speak.<eos> Crap.<eos> Is that what he wants to talk to me about?<eos> He said he wanted to talk to me about something.<eos> Is that what he wanted to talk to me about?<eos> - These poachers.<eos> - Cece... Cece, calm.<eos> You concentrate on Donovan.
No.<eos> They've just been sending me baskets and trying to take me to fancy dinners and stuff.<eos> What?<eos> They've just been giving me baskets<eos> - and trying...<eos> - Listen to me, okay?<eos> I know that gift baskets are great.<eos> - Yeah. - They are.<eos> But once BGE signs you, there are no more baskets.<eos> Because they don't care about you.
What?<eos> They've just been giving me baskets<eos> - and trying...<eos> - Listen to me, okay?<eos> I know that gift baskets are great.<eos> - Yeah. - They are.<eos> But once BGE signs you, there are no more baskets.<eos> Because they don't care about you.<eos> All they care about are numbers.<eos> But you, Donovan, you are my first priority.
I need someone to help me get better at tricks on my motorcycle.<eos> Sure.<eos> I really hate these things.<eos> I just can't stop eating 'em.<eos> I got to say, the taste is average, but the aftertaste is outstanding.<eos> What happens when I'm just an outstanding aftertaste?<eos> When I move out, are you guys gonna forget about me like Coach?<eos> This loft is what tethers us together.<eos> And once it's gone, we're gonna be spread across the Earth like Rod Stewart's offspring.<eos> What I'm gonna miss most about you is all this poetry.
You guys don't need to leave.<eos> Just a minute ago, you were saying how much you love this place.<eos> Just don't get your sack waxed.<eos> Okay, I don't care how big the park is.<eos> If there is a loose bear in it, I'm not going in the park!<eos> I'm never going in that park again!<eos> - I'm never going in again!<eos> - But this is our ritual!<eos> Schmidt, we'll just find a new one.<eos> Easy for you to say.
These are the guys that can sell this stuff.<eos> Not these guys.<eos> But they've already decided on the direction of the ad.<eos> So tell them to change it!<eos> I mean, what have you got to lose?<eos> Hey, Joy.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> - Don't you be scared, kid!<eos> - Nick?<eos> - We're here with you, buddy!
So how's work going?<eos> Everything well?<eos> I'm kind of "fun-employed" right now.<eos> Just going out a lot, having a good time.<eos> Oh, so just... going to clubs and getting drunk a lot?<eos> Plus, my parents are, like, super rich, so it's like, why get a job, right?<eos> Yeah, just keep using their money, right?<eos> After I left LA, I moved to New York, and for the last couple years, I've been working as a lawyer, mostly in the tech industry.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - What do you do?
Like, maybe a hairy arm. Right by a box of Toaster Strudels.<eos> Oh, my God, this place is so cool.<eos> Okay, so you host a cupcake show. That's amazing.<eos> I really like cupcakes.<eos> My favorite kind of cupcakes...<eos> Vanilla frosted, but I also like strawberry frosting, too.<eos> Okay, so I know your job.<eos> Siblings, tell me. How many do you have?<eos> One little brother.<eos> You?
- Is that a line you send to everyone?<eos> - What?<eos> No. I would never do such a thing.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> All right, you show me your messages, I'll show you mine.<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Okay. - Don't back out of this, though.<eos> - I won't.<eos> I won't. I'm here.<eos> All right, I send it to everyone, but everything else is custom charming stuff just for you.
I am so sorry.<eos> Was that long?<eos> Yeah, it was about 15 minutes.<eos> Yeah, that's really bad.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> Um, let me buy us a nice bottle to make up for it?<eos> All right.<eos> What'd you do over the weekend?<eos> Uh, nothing much. Some friends and I went to the Guggenheim.<eos> What about you?
But I'm afraid I'm not allowed to discuss the business of The Order with you present.<eos> Yeah, fine.<eos> I'll fuck off.<eos> Uh, no eating or drinking in the Library except where posted.<eos> Now, Penny, we need to go over some of your...obligations.<eos> I just don't get it.<eos> I mean, I did head off a famine-- personally staved off a war.<eos> Not to mention, The Wellspring is back online.<eos> And yet the people don't like me any more than they did.<eos> How can you possibly know what they actually think of you?
Right now, my approval rating is at 26%, which is not good, Bayler.<eos> Not at all.<eos> But still, why ask me?<eos> Mmm, I don't know.<eos> I figured you might know why they hate me so much, seeing as you tried to murder me.<eos> Okay, that was before I got to know you.<eos> And before you introduced me to this Earth delicacy-- na-chos.<eos> Wait till you try your first margarita.<eos> Listen...<eos> If you're really worried about what the people think of you, let's talk about your wedding.
I'm fine.<eos> I've been self-medicating, so-- uh, they don't have Abilify in Fillory, but I have been improvising.<eos> Well, this is Dr. Josh's prescription.<eos> I mean, we don't have to race off to Fillory right this second.<eos> We have a minute.<eos> What's it do?<eos> Dude, lets you see into other worlds.<eos> It's rad.<eos> This is rad.<eos> Is that you... Quentin?
More like an explosion.<eos> As well a mess of problems for the people who'd find what's left of our bodies.<eos> Touch nothing.<eos> Got it.<eos> Dude, their shit was seriously jacked up.<eos> Their K-holes were inside K-holes.<eos> Does that even make sense?<eos> I'm just saying, the Fu Fighters are out of "comish" for the foreseeable future.<eos> Your wedding may proceed apace, sire.<eos> And you, good sir, may shave any nymph in the kingdom.
- Shit, shit--<eos> - You saw it?<eos> You saw it too.<eos> Fen!<eos> I'm not going mad.<eos> Well... no.<eos> You're not.<eos> It was a fairy, okay?<eos> Look, the day The Wellspring failed, I made a deal to save Eliot's life.<eos> You did, too.
Well, you did.<eos> What do they want?<eos> Your baby.<eos> - What?<eos> - Fen...<eos> I can stop this.<eos> You better fix this, because I will not let them take my child.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Quentin?<eos> Is that you?
I can stop this.<eos> You better fix this, because I will not let them take my child.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Quentin?<eos> Is that you?<eos> You're in a Tesla Flexion.<eos> I'm from another timeline.<eos> We only have two minutes.<eos> I need you to tell me everything you know about Shades.<eos> It is you.
You better fix this, because I will not let them take my child.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Quentin?<eos> Is that you?<eos> You're in a Tesla Flexion.<eos> I'm from another timeline.<eos> We only have two minutes.<eos> I need you to tell me everything you know about Shades.<eos> It is you.<eos> Another you--you're alive.
Yeah, but Harriet didn't know the guy was gonna kill himself.<eos> Are you defending her?<eos> No, I'm just saying that she's not totally wrong.<eos> The Librarians are hiding something.<eos> Yeah, things that are insanely dangerous.<eos> They could have good reasons.<eos> Okay, and who the fuck are librarians to decide who gets what?<eos> Do you really want every Hedge Witch with a grudge and a bad idea to get a nuclear bomb?<eos> Fuck you.<eos> I'm not talking about you.
Then you know I want to be alone.<eos> And, um, also that you probably shouldn't be right now.<eos> Why do you care?<eos> I... just do.<eos> Come with me... and help me try to convince Ember to let us keep Fillory.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because I have never met anyone less willing to take no for an answer.<eos> But I betrayed you, remember?<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> I need help, and you do too.
Physically, she's perfectly safe, but mentally... whew!<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> You know what you learn when you're a High King?<eos> Screwing up is inevitable, and there are some fu... ups you can never un-fu...<eos> It's infuriating and it is heartbreaking, but...<eos> Think I destroyed her, Eliot.<eos> She made plenty of her own choices along the way.<eos> I'm not saying it doesn't suck.<eos> I'm saying...<eos> Fillory needs you.
I'm sorry.<eos> The end of Fillory makes me sad as well.<eos> So Fillory really is done?<eos> I like you.<eos> You care about things.<eos> Yeah, it's not really a trait that's helped me much.<eos> But it could be if it were applied to not trying to fix the unfixable, but rather something fresh and more perfect, like, say...<eos> Care to take a visit?<eos> Make some notes?<eos> - Um, I... uh... - I'm sorry, but you're acting like I'm asking you, whereas I am a god and you are a hairless monkey, so nod and say thank you.
Come and get me, you fu... baby.<eos> You want to know why you're so bored?<eos> Because you're too stupid to get it.<eos> You're too spoiled and entitled to understand...<eos> How dare you?<eos> I am a god.<eos> Are you?<eos> Really?<eos> I'm not impressed.<eos> I've met scary gods, and you?
The answer is no.<eos> There is no actual evidence of a magical surge in Sedona, Arizona.<eos> Yeah, but what about in...<eos> Or Kenya, or Machu Picchu, or China... or anywhere.<eos> Magic is gone.<eos> The best we can do is accept that, and continue our theoretical studies, to stay ready for its return.<eos> So you think that's possible?<eos> Anything is possible, Alice.<eos> Was, anyway.<eos> Look at you, playing the part of the bright, young girl.
I can see my Alice in there still.<eos> Good.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I am as I appear... dying.<eos> So it is true.<eos> Magic's gone everywhere.<eos> The creatures, cryptids, sylphs, dragons, unicorns, even the pointless vampires are all as they were.<eos> But those of us who drew on the power of the Wellspring, well, as you can see...<eos> - I want to help.<eos> - I'm here, Alice, because it is you who needs help.
I've seen how hard it's been on my mom and Darlene to raise kids by themselves.<eos> But you're not doing this by yourself. - Colt!<eos> - I'm gonna be there with you.<eos> I'm not gonna be like Darlene's kid's father.<eos> Or Darlene's other kid's father.<eos> Or your dad.<eos> Or... Darlene's dad.<eos> Colt, do you love me?<eos> I mean... I think you're great.<eos> Well, I don't love you.
Come on, sit down.<eos> We just want you to know that we're here to help.<eos> Yeah, well, it don't matter.<eos> 'Cause Heather ain't keeping the baby, so...<eos> What?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.<eos> I need a beer.<eos> - We're out.<eos> - Fuck this day!<eos> I can't imagine how hard this is for you.
- Are you kiddin' me?<eos> - Found one in the crisper.<eos> You tell Abby yet?<eos> No, she's on a skiing trip with her parents.<eos> What am I supposed to do, leave a text?<eos> Or a voicemail?<eos> "Hey, babe, hope you're having fun.<eos> You know how before you left, I wasn't a father?<eos> Call me back."<eos> You better hurry up before somebody else does.
What's this got to do with Abby?<eos> Well, Bill and Abby's dad play poker together, so...<eos> Bill and I slept in the same tent.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> Sounded like a twelve gauge.<eos> Why are we going toward the gunfire?<eos> - Mary?<eos> - What are you doin'?<eos> What the hell?<eos> Oh, you go near my fucking daughter again, you will have bigger problems than a shot-up truck.
"Chuck, be quiet.<eos> Abby's still sleeping."<eos> Did you take your vitamins?"<eos> "I don't need the damn vitamins!"<eos> "Well, Dr. Randall says you do."<eos> "Janice, do we have to do this now?"<eos> Oh, they fucking did it then.<eos> Anyway, still smoking.<eos> That sounds really tough.<eos> I'm just happy to be here with you.
New job's killing me.<eos> Got into a fight with Mary over my dumb-ass brother...<eos> Now I gotta go home to Umberto and five other guys in some shitty apartment.<eos> You know, one of them assholes ate my Cocoa Puffs.<eos> Yeah, I know you've always been very protective about your cereal.<eos> You know, I have an idea.<eos> Yeah, no, I know.<eos> Deer shit looks just like Cocoa Puffs.<eos> But, Mom, I don't have time to go gather it.<eos> - What if you lived in the hunting' cabin?
Despite that, I still like ya.<eos> I guess I just try real hard not to be bothered about what other people think about me.<eos> And when Jim died, I needed a friend.<eos> I'm not gonna apologize for finding one.<eos> I'm also not gonna apologize for putting ketchup on my mashed potatoes and mustard on my fries.<eos> You should.<eos> Boy... we sure did go through some stuff back then.<eos> Hell, I'm still going through shit.<eos> Oh, I heard.<eos> Rooster's working at Neumann's Hill and, uh, Colt knocked up that Roth girl and... and you and Maggie finalized that divorce.
We need to talk.<eos> You wanna go inside?<eos> No.<eos> I need to finish this, so...<eos> Damn.<eos> I just need to finish this.<eos> Uh... before you say anything...<eos> Not our homecoming picture, 'cause my hair looked fuckin' awesome.<eos> I never wanted to think about you again.
You wanna go inside?<eos> No.<eos> I need to finish this, so...<eos> Damn.<eos> I just need to finish this.<eos> Uh... before you say anything...<eos> Not our homecoming picture, 'cause my hair looked fuckin' awesome.<eos> I never wanted to think about you again.<eos> I was so pissed at you.<eos> Then I started worryin' about how you were doin', which pissed me off even more.
I'm sorry.<eos> We just... We got to the clinic and she... she couldn't go through with it.<eos> Jesus, Colt.<eos> This whole thing is like a relentless shitstorm.<eos> How am I supposed to react to this?<eos> - I was hoping...<eos> - Don't interrupt me!<eos> You know what the worst part is? I can't even be mad.<eos> Who am I gonna be mad at? Heather, for wanting to keep her baby?<eos> You, for wanting to support her?
Who am I gonna be mad at? Heather, for wanting to keep her baby?<eos> You, for wanting to support her?<eos> The baby? It's a fucking baby!<eos> - I get that this...<eos> - I'm not done! Okay?<eos> What's the deal, huh?<eos> You're just gonna... Have a kid with another woman and I'm supposed to go along with it?<eos> Well, say somethin'!<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I love you, and I wanna be with you, but I also... I get how messed up all this is.
"We"?<eos> Yeah, didn't you hear the part where I said "I love you"?<eos> No. I heard the part where you said I was the worst.<eos> Well...<eos> I meant I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Ugh, you're the worst.<eos> Just to be clear, this food belongs to the bar.<eos> It's only here temporarily.<eos> Same goes for you.
Same goes for you.<eos> - Love you, too, Daddy.<eos> - Get away.<eos> What's with all the food?<eos> Oh, shit. Are the Russians comin'?<eos> Are we hunkering' down?<eos> No, dummy.<eos> The bar flooded, the freezer shorted, so now we're moving all the shit over here.<eos> Dad's insulting' me, Mom wants to sell the bar...<eos> And if you're gonna wear a shirt like that, you need to start doin' more curls.
What the fuck, dude?<eos> I got a text from Mary.<eos> I didn't wanna ruin it for them. I did wanna ruin it for you.<eos> Oh, my God, you're gonna be a dad!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, my God. You're gonna be a dad.<eos> That's the same thing I said.<eos> Congratulations, Colt.<eos> I got some old phone books if you need a car seat.<eos> Yeah, I'm happy for you, dude.
- Oh, God, they're getting married.<eos> - Honey, have you thought this through?<eos> It's not that.<eos> But good to know that's how that would've gone.<eos> Colt?<eos> - Right.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How do I say this?<eos> You know, sometimes in life, things happen that we don't expect.<eos> Oh, God, you got Abby pregnant.
You know, I want everything out in the open.<eos> Or not.<eos> It's up to you.<eos> Colt, could we have a moment with Abby?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Sit down.<eos> Yes, Ma'am.<eos> Whatever you have to say to me, you can say in front of Colt.<eos> Fine.<eos> What does this guy have to do to make you realize you shouldn't be with him?
First kid to call him Daddy won't be mine.<eos> First kid to go to prom won't be mine.<eos> First kid to go to college...<eos> Well, it is Colt and Heather, so I might have a shot at that one.<eos> Look, your time with Colt will come and it'll be just as special.<eos> It was easier when I thought they weren't gonna keep the baby.<eos> That make me a terrible person?<eos> You're a wonderful person going through a... a tough time.<eos> But you're not gonna go through it alone. Okay?<eos> Colt's gonna be there for you.
You can't. You're not gonna fix it.<eos> Just be there for her.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> It's just... hard.<eos> With work and her parents.<eos> Heather.<eos> How the fuck did this become my life?<eos> Well, would you like me to walk you through it?<eos> 'Cause I could draw a diagram with three stick figures and one little stick.<eos> Look, you've created a messy situation.
We'll see about that.<eos> - What are you doin' here?<eos> - Well, I'm livin' here now.<eos> Like hell you are.<eos> Guess we know who Daddy's favorite is.<eos> Want your belt, Daddy?<eos> What I want is for you to get out of my huntin' cabin.<eos> Well, that's the thing, Dad.<eos> It's not your huntin' cabin anymore, it's Mom's.<eos> So if anybody's gettin' out of here, it's gonna be you, neighbor.
Damn it, Dale, you know?<eos> And speaking of Dale, you're not gonna be able to hire him, 'cause he's not on our approved list of vets.<eos> - What?<eos> No one told me that. - I did.<eos> I e-mailed it to you.<eos> The subject of the e-mail was, "Vets you can and cannot hire."<eos> Yeah, about that, um... you know, they hired me here to run this ranch 'cause they trust my judgment.<eos> Now, I've worked with Dale my entire life, and he's the best vet in the state.<eos> So... I'm gonna hire him here.<eos> Hey, man, if you feel that strongly about it, I say good for you.
Yeah, she ain't the only one.<eos> I told Abby about everything.<eos> Now she's not talkin' to me.<eos> I'm sorry, but she has to figure out what she wants.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> In the meantime, you need to focus on how you can help Heather.<eos> Oh, right, we're talkin' about the other woman that hates me.<eos> Well, Colt, I'm sure there's more than two women who hate you.<eos> Try to imagine what it would be like to be a 23-year-old woman in a small town getting an abortion.<eos> I mean, she feels like everybody's judging her, including you.
Well, Colt, I'm sure there's more than two women who hate you.<eos> Try to imagine what it would be like to be a 23-year-old woman in a small town getting an abortion.<eos> I mean, she feels like everybody's judging her, including you.<eos> I ain't judging' her.<eos> I just think what she's doin' is totally wrong.<eos> Let me rephrase.<eos> Heather could use your support.<eos> Well, how am I supposed to support her if I don't agree with what she's doin'?<eos> You do it because you care.<eos> I support you, and I don't agree with practically anything you do.
I mean, you're judging' me right now.<eos> And, by the way, I forgive you.<eos> Not really in a joking mood, Colt.<eos> Okay.<eos> But telling' me not to be funny is kind of like tellin' me not to be good-lookin'.<eos> I can try.<eos> Right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Look... we're probably not gonna ever see eye to eye on this... but I want to support you.<eos> I care about you.
Well, from this spot, I just barely connect to the house Wi-Fi.<eos> Don't tell Dad.<eos> Out here, my fridge and my bathroom are in the same spot, so that's cool.<eos> So... what's up with you?<eos> Taking Heather to the clinic tomorrow.<eos> Damn.<eos> You wanna talk about it?<eos> Nope.<eos> That's why I come out here.<eos> To hang out and get drunk with you.

I was the fuckin' quarterback.<eos> Can you really call yourself the quarterback if you only complete passes to the other team?<eos> You're an asshole.<eos> Look, man... I know this whole thing with Heather sucks, but... With the passage of a little time, the healing' will begin.<eos> Even though it seems impossible right now... you'll be a stronger person for the experience.<eos> You learn that for your women's studies?<eos> No, David Jennings' mom.<eos> We talked for, like, 20 minutes about her dead son.<eos> I wonder if she's still hot.<eos> I'm just sayin', if you gave me a key, I could open the bar for you.
You doin' okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, hey, I, uh... I brought you somethin'.<eos> Whoa!<eos> It's, uh... my, uh, Saint Christopher's medal. It's supposed to protect you.<eos> I know it's silly, but when I was playin' football, I had, like, four surgeries on my knee.<eos> I wore it every time, came out fine.<eos> Maybe you should have worn it while you were playin'.<eos> Maybe I should have wore it when we were fuckin'.<eos> It's real sweet of you.
What's more American than that?<eos> Damn it.<eos> How did this happen, man?<eos> I'm the fucking Rooster.<eos> My shit's locked down tight.<eos> Now, I got my right-hand man on his way down to Mexico.<eos> We're stuck here in jail.<eos> Supposed to have all the cows tagged tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.<eos> God, I fucked everything up.<eos> Is this what it feels like to be you?
No, it was the time they went streaking through Arby's, yelling,<eos> - Jesus.<eos> - That's right.<eos> Are we bad parents?<eos> If we were bad parents, we wouldn't be here bailing 'em out.<eos> Oh, uh, Jerry sent me an e-mail. He wants to meet later.<eos> Apparently, I have an offer on the bar.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, good for you.
Horse?<eos> Aw, that is so sweet.<eos> - Beau, did you make this?<eos> - Yeah, my father made it for me.<eos> I gave it to Rooster and Colt.<eos> Colt tried to run away from home with it one day.<eos> He sat in the driveway and rocked and rocked for about three hours.<eos> At least he's always been good-looking.<eos> Thank you so much, Mr. Bennett.<eos> I know this isn't easy for you.

What is it with this town and yarn?<eos> By the way, thank you for the pot holders.<eos> I'm sorry, you know, about the only way you're gonna make more is if you burn the place down for the insurance money.<eos> But that's not legal advice.<eos> And it certainly has nothing to do with... you know, my completely accidental boat fire.<eos> Hey, Heather.<eos> Hey, Mr. Bennett.<eos> I brought you a little gift.<eos> I've been thinking about apple pie since this morning.<eos> Almost built you a crib so I could have an excuse to go back.
Sure.<eos> I'll figure it out.<eos> Great.<eos> Give me that!<eos> Fuck, this is delicious!<eos> Look...<eos> Just wanna say, you were right about this... this job.<eos> A lot of people'd kill for it.<eos> I nearly pissed it away.<eos> Without you and Abby and all your help, you know... tagging the cows and helping me turn this around... never would have happened.
Well, I just had the worst weekend of my life.<eos> And I can't have y'all fighting.<eos> So you gotta get along.<eos> You can't force us to be friends, Colt.<eos> So, what do I do?<eos> You tell me what I need to do to make this better.<eos> 'Cause I'm freaking out.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Uh, we're having a baby.<eos> That's right, you, me, us, like, together.
I'm sorry.<eos> - I didn't mean to take that from you.<eos> - I know.<eos> This, though, I... I don't regret.<eos> Just so you know... I'm jealous of you, too.<eos> You went to college, you got a great job, you don't live at home with your mom, your sister and her kids.<eos> Could be doing a little better on the boyfriend front, though.<eos> Okay, I don't think that's necessary...<eos> Colt, don't interrupt her.<eos> Listen, it's not always gonna be easy, but... I wanna do whatever I can to be there for you and the baby.
Remember when you started that bonfire on the ice?<eos> Oh, man, heat rises.<eos> Yeah, well, our truck sank.<eos> - Hey, can you get off work?<eos> - 'Course I can.<eos> I'm the fuckin' boss.<eos> Hey, and I go where my fucking boss goes.<eos> Oh, oh, check it out.<eos> This is truly the greatest country in the world.<eos> All right... - Got a hypothetical for you.
I never thought Rooster would be working another ranch.<eos> Things change.<eos> Yes, they do.<eos> Yes, they do.<eos> Oh, my God, here's one of those letters you wrote me when I was off at college.<eos> - God, you kept that?<eos> - 'Course I did.<eos> It's evidence you have a heart.<eos> "Dear Maggie,<eos> "Patsy Cline came on the radio today, and I thought of you.
- God, you kept that?<eos> - 'Course I did.<eos> It's evidence you have a heart.<eos> "Dear Maggie,<eos> "Patsy Cline came on the radio today, and I thought of you.<eos> "I know you've only been gone a few weeks, but it feels like forever.<eos> "I've taken to growing a mustache.<eos> I'm not sure it suits me.<eos> "I'll probably shave it off in a week.<eos> "Things back here aren't the same without you.
Same age as Rooster was when he got out of diapers.<eos> So, uh... I have some news.<eos> Well, I know it isn't, "I caught a fish."<eos> I bought a home.<eos> I am a homeowner.<eos> - What?<eos> - Man, that's great.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Couldn't get $20 out of the ATM today, but that's good for you.
It's not in my nature to deny someone a steak.<eos> Thank you, Beau.<eos> I'm just fuckin' with ya.<eos> See?<eos> Told you he'd be here.<eos> Only bar within 50 miles.<eos> Yeah, well, I've never said this before, but you are a smart man, Colt.<eos> 'Sup, dipshit?<eos> Shouldn't you be back on the ranch tagging some cows?<eos> Yeah, I care about you too much to leave you here.
Well, it was interesting.<eos> I'm sittin' there at a place where you and I have been a thousand times before, and I'm thinkin' about how you always ordered the rib eye and a salad.<eos> But you didn't want the mashed potatoes, so I'd order double... 'cause when the food came, you'd always eat half of mine.<eos> I didn't do that every time.<eos> No.<eos> Sometimes you ate all the potatoes.<eos> Point is...<eos> I had a good time with Brenda.<eos> She's smart, she's funny, she's good-lookin'.<eos> But she's not you.
No, I am not.<eos> I have no idea what I'm doing.<eos> I'm just trying my best.<eos> In six months, it'll be easier than it is today.<eos> And six months after that, who knows, maybe I'll be introducing you to my new boyfriend.<eos> A vegan, liberal, yoga teacher.<eos> If you're trying to piss me off, it's workin'.<eos> Well, that's okay, 'cause my new boyfriend will teach you poses to help you relax.<eos> Patsy Cline.<eos> Yeah, I was thinking about you tonight, too.
- Yeah.<eos> Look, Ed... I need your help, all right?<eos> Any way you can call Neumann's Hill and try and get me my job back?<eos> Look, man, I'll do anything, okay?<eos> I'll even go to that meeting, you know, with the... with the...<eos> The one led by the hot chick with the... with the big rack.<eos> The sexual harassment seminar?<eos> Yeah, man, that one!<eos> Rooster, I'd love to help you, but I can't.<eos> But you're the one who hired me there.
- Oh, my God!<eos> Must be two feet of snow out there already.<eos> Had to tie my bra to the antenna so I could find my car in the morning.<eos> Smart.<eos> Oh, hold on.<eos> I just told you I wasn't wearing a bra, you didn't ask to motorboat me?<eos> You feeling okay?<eos> Just a long, shit day.<eos> Sorry.<eos> To you and your boobs.
Honey, I'm just trying to help you.<eos> - Well, I don't need your help.<eos> - Oh, yeah, no, you're right.<eos> Unemployed guy living in his mom's hunting cabin, eating a dented can of spaghetti rings.<eos> No, you don't need my help.<eos> Nope.<eos> First of all, I dented that myself, okay?<eos> You save 25 cents.<eos> Secondly, I'm doing fine.<eos> Well, I could... I could put in a word for you at the Cracker Barrel.
Shit!<eos> Holy shit!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> That scared the crap out of me.<eos> My God, this is the last thing I need.<eos> Jesus! Fucking...<eos> It's freezing!<eos> Okay, guys... I think I'm gonna have to shut it down 'cause of the storm, so this is last call.<eos> So it's time we get you home.<eos> I don't know what I'd do without you.
You really need to spit, don't you?<eos> Nope.<eos> You somehow made it more disgusting.<eos> Well, at least I ain't gotta breathe it in.<eos> Stop it!<eos> I'm blowin' it out the window!<eos> Roll your window up, Colt!<eos> - Put out your cigarette out. - My God.<eos> You're making me miserable on my birthday.<eos> No, you're making you miserable on your birthday.
I saw the tickets, Colt.<eos> Front row of the balcony.<eos> That's even better.<eos> You gotta puke, it's only a problem for the rich guy sittin' below you.<eos> I'm bummed out too, but it's not your fault we got stuck.<eos> - Are you gonna leave me?<eos> - What?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> It's always somethin' with us.<eos> You and Kenny, right?
Or ditch school and go fishing.<eos> Or ditch school and go...<eos> - How'd I graduate?<eos> - I did all your homework.<eos> We were 17.<eos> It's different now.<eos> We're older.<eos> We have responsibilities.<eos> That doesn't mean we still can't have fun.<eos> That's another thing I love about you, you're the most fun person I have ever met.
What is she, on a date?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What's a pregnant lady doing on a date?<eos> Oh, I know the answer to this one.<eos> "I don't give a fuck."<eos> I'm just saying, it's weird.<eos> No, what's weird is, later on tonight, that dude's dong is gonna be banging into your baby's head.<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?<eos> Look, man, I'm just sayin'.<eos> Kid's gonna end up having as many concussions as you before he's even born.
I'll bring it right out to you.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Who's your friend? Paul.<eos> Paul?<eos> That's a weird name.<eos> Okay, Colt and Rooster.<eos> I've never seen him before.<eos> Is he new?<eos> Compared to my last boyfriend, he's new and improved.<eos> That's you, Colt.
So look, uh, just wonderin' if you heard of anybody... looking for a hard-workin'... seasoned rancher who's got a sexy smile and a badass head of hair.<eos> Oh, Colt's out of work too, huh?<eos> Well, you might try the Cranstons.<eos> I hear their, uh, youngest is gonna go, uh, join the Cirque du Soleil.<eos> He always was a bendy little feller.<eos> Eddie, huh?<eos> Yeah, that makes sense.<eos> Most kids you had to shove into a locker, but he'd just fold right up.<eos> Yeah, he don't go till next summer.<eos> I'll put in a good word for you.
What kind of 30-year-old guy just moves to Garrison, Colorado out of nowhere and starts dating' a 23-year-old?<eos> Uh, you did.<eos> You know what Mom wants to talk to us about?<eos> - No clue.<eos> - Really?<eos> Wait.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Is this an intervention?<eos> - Did you break our pact? - Uh, no.<eos> Did you?
Something I need to talk to you about...<eos> Mom, I'll take it from here.<eos> Rooster, your drinking has affected me and...<eos> That talk is coming, but not today.<eos> Look, when you guys were little, if I bought one of you a toy, I had to get the other one a toy.<eos> So, with that in mind, Colt, I got you this.<eos> Thin Mints!<eos> And they're frozen!<eos> Fuck, yeah!<eos> I got you something, too, Rooster.
I wanna give you the bar. What the fuck?<eos> Wait, what?<eos> What... what are you talkin' about?<eos> Look, it's a simple proposal.<eos> You run the place and we split the profits.<eos> That way, you have a steady job and I can, you know, finally get out of here and travel.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> First, you give Rooster the huntin' cabin and now you're givin' him a job where he works at a bar and he gets to drink all day?<eos> I have a job where I work with Dad and I have to drink all day!<eos> Look, Colt, I'd do the same for you, but you don't need a job or a place to live.
I mean... could I really sell kids fake IDs and then accept them?<eos> I believe I could.<eos> Look, Rooster, your problem has always been that you don't like people telling you what to do.<eos> I mean, when you were born, the doctor slapped you to make you cry and you just laughed at him and peed in his face.<eos> That would be pretty badass.<eos> Make my own rules and don't even follow 'em.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm startin' to like this.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I run the ranch, you run the bar...
I'll be honest with you.<eos> - I came here to check you out.<eos> - What?<eos> I'm the father of Heather's baby.<eos> It's my first kid, so... I...<eos> I just... wanted to make sure you weren't some kind of crazy psychopath.<eos> You know the kind of guy I'm talking about.<eos> Yeah, I think I do.<eos> But, actually, you seem like a pretty good guy, so...<eos> I'm happy you and Heather met.
What am I supposed to do?<eos> Introduce him to my ex-boyfriend?<eos> I already had to start with "I'm pregnant."<eos> I'm just being protective of my kid.<eos> Oh, so, what? Now I just don't know how to judge someone's character or make good decisions?<eos> Well, uh, father of the baby.<eos> Maybe I'm the one who can't judge character. Whoa!<eos> I thought you were stayin' out of this. I'm trying.<eos> It's very hard.<eos> Hey, Colt, do you believe I care just as much about this kid as you do?
Yeah, and I'm just telling you about your life.<eos> You don't wanna work at this place.<eos> Don't I?<eos> I mean, I need a job.<eos> I need money. Oh, no.<eos> You have something much more important than money.<eos> You have a passion for ranching.<eos> I also have a passion to pay my phone bill.<eos> Look, that's gonna work itself out.<eos> You know, Dale will keep using you, you can work around here whenever you need to.
Hey, I was just hopin' you'd give me a hand.<eos> Look... things are pretty tight around here right now.<eos> We've got cows to get through the winter.<eos> Gotta hire a new man in the spring.<eos> I'd love to help you two out, but... all I can spare is a couple hundred bucks right now.<eos> Yeah, I understand.<eos> Kids don't come cheap, Colt.<eos> When your mother got pregnant, we had to sit down, work out a real strict budget.<eos> You know we used to have Broncos seats?<eos> We gave those up for you and Rooster.
Yeah, good one.<eos> Hey, why don't you drop me off at the hospital on the way, and I can, uh, go play checkers with some old, sick people.<eos> Seriously?<eos> You talked to Craig?<eos> What changed your mind?<eos> Family first.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> You're a stock boy?<eos> What happened? Walmart doesn't need no greeters?<eos> Look, I know this isn't easy for you.
Holy shit!<eos> You're a stock boy?<eos> What happened? Walmart doesn't need no greeters?<eos> Look, I know this isn't easy for you.<eos> It wasn't my first choice, but it'll do.<eos> Four or five nights a week.<eos> That's 20 hours, 200 bucks.<eos> Plus, they're lettin' me bring home all the damaged fruit.<eos> Anyone want a bruised peach or... what we'll call brown berries?<eos> I'm proud of you, Colt.
Freedom like that's the best thing in the world.<eos> Except for cocaine.<eos> Fuck, I miss getting high.<eos> Where are you headed next?<eos> Well, after what I just said, I should probably hit a meeting up somewhere around here.<eos> Then I got a gig in Albuquerque in a few days. I'm playing the Bernalillo Winter Harvest.<eos> I go on right after they crown the Bernalillo Armadillo Princess.<eos> You want a ride?<eos> You wanna go on the road with me?<eos> Well, I wanna go to Albuquerque with you.
That guy don't even drink.<eos> Are you fucking kidding?<eos> You're going down the road with some guy you met in the bar?<eos> It's not about the guy.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> You could've sold that place three weeks ago.<eos> I don't have to explain myself to you.<eos> I'm doing it. That's it.<eos> Great.<eos> Good for you.
You could've sold that place three weeks ago.<eos> I don't have to explain myself to you.<eos> I'm doing it. That's it.<eos> Great.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Gee, I just don't think he meant that.<eos> I don't like it either.<eos> You're just walking out on us.<eos> Well, go on, you going, too?<eos> No, I'm happy for you.
One of their trucks hit you in the parking lot?<eos> I, uh, I got a second job stocking shelves.<eos> So I... I also, uh, opened up a savings account for the baby.<eos> You opened up a savings account?<eos> That is really sweet, Colt.<eos> Somethin' I wanna do for the little guy, or girl.<eos> Hopefully it's a boy.<eos> Either way, as long as it's healthy, right?<eos> Ten fingers, ten toes, and a penis.<eos> All right, here you go.
And somewhere along the line, I just became invisible.<eos> I'm Beau's wife, or your mother, or Hank's bartender.<eos> I just stopped being Maggie.<eos> And I got a whole list of things that Maggie never got to do.<eos> You know, go to Paris, learn to paint, go on The Price Is Right and kiss Bob Barker.<eos> And that's already gone!<eos> So if it makes me selfish to wanna go to New Mexico, not even Mexico, Colt, New Mexico, then I'm fucking selfish.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> I just saw that sweet display where they put the, uh, Bud and the Bud Light cans made it into the American flag.<eos> Did you make that?
Hey, guys.<eos> I just saw that sweet display where they put the, uh, Bud and the Bud Light cans made it into the American flag.<eos> Did you make that?<eos> I wish.<eos> I had a little problem with the Charmin pyramid.<eos> Now they won't let me stack anything higher than my waist.<eos> That's cool.<eos> Hey, uh, remember when you used to be a pro football player?<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - Well, I just came here to get a case of beer and make fun of you, so one down.
She asked... And then she said we're supposed to find out whether or not it's a boy or girl.<eos> You know, hopefully it's a boy.<eos> But either way, you know, boy.<eos> Well, of course you should go.<eos> - It's just... - Are you mad?<eos> No, I'm...<eos> - disappointed.<eos> - Aw, that's even worse!<eos> It's fine, okay.<eos> I wanted to hang out with you, that's all.
Got a little kick.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> Colt, are you okay?<eos> I just, uh, ate a pepper.<eos> Wasn't even hot.<eos> What're you doing here?<eos> Well, I figured we couldn't make time after work, so... maybe we can make time during work.<eos> And I just... I felt bad for getting pissy about the doctor's appointment.<eos> That's so sweet.<eos> Well, if you were the type of guy to blow something like that off, I wouldn't want to be with you.
What do you want me to say?<eos> You're running off with some musician like a damn teenager.<eos> I tried to get you to go with me last time, but you didn't want to leave.<eos> This town isn't good enough for you?<eos> There's more to the world than this town.<eos> God.<eos> Once in your fucking life, why can't you just be supportive?<eos> Because I don't want you to leave.<eos> Okay, well, when's it gonna matter what I want?<eos> I don't know what life looks like without you.
That they still want you to kiss their babies.<eos> They might not love you for much longer. What?<eos> Come on.<eos> What's not to love?<eos> Gideon, trust me when I tell you, If this convention doesn't go off without a hitch, This very well could be our last.<eos> This is the first time in your career where you've dug.<eos> Yourself into a hole, and I don't know if I can dig you out.<eos> If you don't stop checking those crime stats, I'm gonna shove that phone so far down your throat, There's gonna be a new crime.<eos> All right.<eos> God, murderous rage is... It's very attractive on you.
Well, we have her coming through surveillance. With a different wristband.<eos> The all-access wristband we're tracking...<eos> She said she found from across the bathrooms.<eos> If she didn't do it, why'd she run?<eos> Because she has a stolen wristband, Sherlock.<eos> She thought that we were busting her. For trying to score some swag. With upgraded access.<eos> Okay, then why'd the bad guy. Ditch it here?<eos> Maybe because he was in there.<eos> What the hell did he want back here?<eos> Okay, look, the me that cares about you really hopes. They catch this guy. But the me.
Clapa!<eos> The Danes... the ugly Danes who were sat there, when did they leave?<eos> I'm allowed to take an eye.<eos> Which one would you like to keep?<eos> The blue one.<eos> I swear I'll kill you before we reach Kjartan.<eos> I look forward to seeing you try.<eos> No!<eos> I need one of them alive!<eos> Not you.
You, too, Frank.<eos> - All right, bye.<eos> - All right. Take care.<eos> Well, I'm glad that you find my intimate recollections so engrossing, but I was under the impression that you came here to help pack.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I'll get right on that.<eos> This is amazing stuff.<eos> I mean, it says here. McGarrett was a fugitive for a couple days?<eos> Yes. That was an unfortunate misunderstanding.<eos> Whoa, hold up.<eos> He came to you for help?
He might not be so happy to see you.<eos> Okay, and you wait until now to mention this?<eos> Sorry. Small oversight.<eos> G-Stealth!<eos> Five-O!<eos> Open up!<eos> Not good.<eos> Hirsch? What the hell are you doing here?<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> You son of a bitch.
Well...<eos> Whatever.<eos> Just go!<eos> Drive!<eos> Now!<eos> Nice going, Hirsch.<eos> G-Stealth's footage give us anything yet?<eos> We're just going through it now.<eos> It's about 40 minutes of tape.<eos> What about you?
Guys, come on back here.<eos> Apparently, Rorke had an accomplice... But from the looks of things, he must have sustained these wounds in a blast.<eos> Obviously, Rorke didn't want to take him to the hospital.<eos> No I.D.<eos> All right, let's run this guy's prints through the system.<eos> Get CSU down here to tear this place apart so they can find something to tell us where Rorke is.<eos> It's getting good now.<eos> Well, I'm sorry to disturb you, but if you're not gonna help me pack my belongings, could I at least ask you to try to stay out of my way?<eos> Sorry.<eos> The way you and Sabrina met, it was classic... it's, like, right out of a Rom-com.
Detective Williams may have a gruff exterior, but underneath is a very caring individual.<eos> I mean, considering the sacrifice he made for his daughter by moving out here, or the fact that he gave up a piece of his vital organ without hesitation in order to save Commander McGarrett.<eos> And at times, he can be quite witty.<eos> Max, can I ask you something?<eos> Of course.<eos> Have you ever mentioned any of this to Detective Williams?<eos> No. That would be inappropriate.<eos> What?<eos> Sharing your feelings?<eos> Telling the people in your life what they mean to you?
Of course.<eos> Have you ever mentioned any of this to Detective Williams?<eos> No. That would be inappropriate.<eos> What?<eos> Sharing your feelings?<eos> Telling the people in your life what they mean to you?<eos> How is that inappropriate?<eos> Well, perhaps you're right, but it's just something I'm not comfortable with.<eos> I get that.<eos> It isn't easy for you, but you're going to have to get past that.
So please contact me at any time.<eos> So with that, I just wanted to say mahalo.<eos> It's been a honor and privilege to be working with the HPD and the Five-0 Task Force. Thanks, man.<eos> But, what I will miss the most is... is my adopted family.<eos> And by that I mean you.<eos> As you know, I grew up as an only child.<eos> And I always wanted a big brother.<eos> And when I started working with the Five-0, I finally got one.<eos> Mahalo, Max.<eos> This might be a surprise to you, but I always considered you as something of a role model.
Mahalo, Max.<eos> This might be a surprise to you, but I always considered you as something of a role model.<eos> That does, that does surprise me.<eos> Surprises us all, Max, but go on.<eos> I've always been on the receiving end of your sarcasm, but, truth be told, it never bothered me.<eos> I always took them as a token of affection.<eos> I'm going to miss your little quips.<eos> I hope that you would consider texting me one of those from time to time.<eos> To you, buddy.<eos> Nobody understands the meaning of ohana more than you.

For all our sakes.<eos> That great army is doubtless on its way here already.<eos> I charge you, my son, to go out and face it.<eos> If it really is as great as the bishop suggested, then I'll need some extra time to raise more men at arms.<eos> I agree.<eos> But now time itself is of the essence.<eos> They cannot bring such a force, on foot, or by boat, to Wessex within a week!<eos> Even so, the element of surprise is the most valuable asset.<eos> Father, since you've given me command, then let me exercise it.<eos> Father, I want to fight with you.
Farewell for now.<eos> Fear nothing.<eos> We shall all be together soon.<eos> Praise the Lord.<eos> My husband.<eos> You depart with our love, and carry our hopes.<eos> Fare you well.<eos> Live, live, and live!<eos> I will try.<eos> As I'll also try to be worthy of you, Judith.
Can you understand?<eos> Your dream seemed a long time away.<eos> But I was wrong, so wrong, I should have waited!<eos> And now I see why.<eos> You are going to do exactly what you said you would do.<eos> And I should have believed you.<eos> I believe you now.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> Seems like, after all,<eos> I know women a lot better than you, brother!
I do not yet know where it comes from but I will not stop looking until I find out.<eos> You see, it's not what I do, it's who I am.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To a house of ill-repute.<eos> Many of these women are very sick.<eos> Will I find you here when I return?<eos> Do you wish to find me?<eos> You're the detective.<eos> The English will have sight of the Dutch coast in days.<eos> Turenne will retain command but you are to take charge of the assault on Maastricht.
Me?<eos> And Amsterdam?<eos> It will be yours.<eos> You are placing the entire fate of France in my hands, Why?<eos> I hardly have to say it.<eos> Might be nice to hear.<eos> Glory.<eos> Whose?<eos> Ours.<eos> It is time for you to carve your name in history.
And you must be the angel who aids these girls in their afflictions.<eos> I wouldn't call pregnancy an affliction.<eos> You take unwanted babies into care?<eos> Well, we have a small home for orphans near Saint-Denis, yes.<eos> They each receive food, a bed, an education, and are kept as far away as possible the sins of their mother.<eos> Well, I prefer errors.<eos> If only there were more like you.<eos> We all do what we can.<eos> I'll shall be back later, drunk.<eos> Then I shall expect to find you and the bed quite warm.
Suffering.<eos> Why does the King get to declare war and I don't?<eos> Why can't I do that?<eos> In fact, you know, I think I will.<eos> I will declare war on someone today.<eos> You can't go.<eos> I forbid it.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Very well.<eos> Then I shall come with you!
I'm called by a higher purpose to command my armies myself.<eos> It is I who must go.<eos> You are to remain here.<eos> Is that it?<eos> No apology, no nothing!<eos> I cannot stay here any longer.<eos> What is this higher purpose?<eos> Bontemps, he came to me because he was concerned, because we're all concerned.<eos> Then you will know why I must go.<eos> Take me with you.
The note was by his hand.<eos> You think otherwise?<eos> I don't know what to think, Sire.<eos> I'm too bound in grief right now.<eos> You understand the weight that falls upon your shoulders in my absence?<eos> Trust your advisors, keep your own counsel., hide your true feelings.<eos> Good day, Madame.<eos> Make me proud of you.<eos> Your word will be law, Sire, and disobedience will find it's reward.<eos> Please, take me with you.
You fear the Queen as Regent?<eos> Right now, Sire, I fear everything I've ever dreamed of.<eos> No harm will come to you.<eos> His Majesty does not see how strong she is.<eos> She knows the place that you have in my heart and she will do anything she can to come between us.<eos> She will rule on my behalf, not on her own.<eos> You decided to be your own First Minister!<eos> You decided to rule alone.<eos> You chose me!<eos> You kissed me by the fountain. It was you and only you!
Hey, Dev.<eos> Uh, great job, man, great job.<eos> Uh, we got a small issue on the last segment, though.<eos> What's up, Lawrence?<eos> So the Jabbawockeez, they don't take their masks off.<eos> They need to take the masks off, right? They gotta taste the cupcakes.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Apparently, it's in their contract that they don't take their masks off.<eos> Like, somebody should have read that beforehand.<eos> Yeah, somebody, you. You're the producer that booked 'em.
Hey, what's up, Lisa?<eos> Just coming in for a quick touch-up.<eos> Sure.<eos> So you're Indian, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, I'm friends with this Indian guy I think you might know.<eos> Come on, you're not gonna do that shit, are you, Lisa?<eos> You don't go up to white people and go, "Hey, you're white, right?<eos> I know this white person. You might know 'em?"<eos> Well, he said he went to college with you.
Well, he said he went to college with you.<eos> All right, I do know him. - Hmm.<eos> - My bad.<eos> That's the only time in history that hasn't been racist.<eos> Uh, Dev, um, one more thing.<eos> When we sign off, make sure you go,<eos> "Thank you to the Jabbawockeez for blessing the stage."<eos> No, I'm not saying that.<eos> But you have to. It's in the contract.<eos> And when you say it, make sure you put a little pizzazz in it.
Please, do it for me just once.<eos> Please. Please?<eos> Please? Please welcome, all the way from Cleveland, Karen from Karen's Confections!<eos> That was awful.<eos> Ah. So this is the piece that I really wanted to see.<eos> It's called The Dinner Party.<eos> Cool.<eos> Is it me or do all these look like vaginas?<eos> Whoa. Did this lady have a piano vagina?<eos> I'm never going to a museum with you again.
Speaking of which, I got dinner number four. I'm meeting some people from my new charity, Jeff's Kids.<eos> Love those kids.<eos> Don't have a heart attack.<eos> Timmy, can we get a check?<eos> Oh, Chef, the meal's compliments of the house.<eos> God damn it, you son of a bitch! You son of a bitch!<eos> They do this all the time.<eos> All right, tell him thanks.<eos> Oh, shit. I almost forgot.<eos> Bottle of champagne there, I brought that for you.
Uh, I'll do flat.<eos> So how was your day?<eos> It was good.<eos> Um, we did a taping of Clash of the Cupcakes.<eos> Uh, you know we had that dance crew the Jabbawockeez on earlier this week?<eos> Who is that?<eos> They're like these guys. They, like, dance and have masks.<eos> They were really good.<eos> Cool.<eos> Um, how about you?
- No, you can... You can have a bite.<eos> Doing anything fun for the weekend?<eos> Um, yeah, I'm going to a Rangers game.<eos> Are you into hockey?<eos> I know of hockey.<eos> Um, I've never been to a game, though, or watched one on TV.<eos> - But I've heard it's fun.<eos> - It's fun. Yeah.<eos> I grew up watching a bunch of sports with my dad.<eos> What about you?
- You crazy too. - See?<eos> Gonna grab some of the wine that doesn't taste like white, uh, feet wine, whatever.<eos> Hey, I thought it was good.<eos> I'm gonna have to agree with your cute girlfriend over there.<eos> She's not my girlfriend. Just a friend.<eos> Really?<eos> Are you hoping for more?<eos> No, no, it's not like that. She's, uh, dating this guy, Pino.<eos> Pino?<eos> It's not gonna end well for you, little D.
That sounds so rude.<eos> Um, uh, the hotel's right around the corner, sir.<eos> Oh, yeah. Thank you.<eos> What a night.<eos> I still can't believe it.<eos> I mean, New York, the food was amazing. And John Legend just played the piano in a room, and I was in that room too.<eos> Yeah, you were.<eos> This is insane!<eos> I mean, nobody's gonna believe me.<eos> I had so much fun with you tonight.
♪ ♪<eos> All right, so... I wanted to talk to you about this Clash of the Cupcakes thing. Mm-hmm.<eos> I am so flattered.<eos> Um... I can't believe you guys would want to work with me for seven seasons, and it seems like a tremendous opportunity, but I...<eos> I don't think it's the right fit for me.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You don't want to do it?<eos> It's just that I'm not super passionate about the show.<eos> And if I'm doing it for seven seasons, that's a long time.<eos> And I... I don't think it'd be fair to you or to me if I... if I did something like that without my heart being fully invested in it, you know what I mean?
She's a CPA.<eos> She has a dog named Coco.<eos> I love Coco very much.<eos> I find it very entertaining to spend time with him.<eos> She sounds great too.<eos> Yes, I'm very pleased.<eos> But at the same time, it's quite a conundrum.<eos> I like both of these women, but I need to choose one.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I mean, it's kind of hard for me to answer that for you.
Best Food Friends.<eos> Best... Food Friends?<eos> I love it!<eos> - Really?<eos> - I love it!<eos> I love it. It is great!<eos> I mean, I've been dying to figure out a reason to get back on the road, right? And it's fresh.<eos> It's new. I love it.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Look at you, huh?
Look at you, huh?<eos> This guy, he comes into my office.<eos> He slams his balls on my table. Walks out, comes back a few days later, drops his pants, pisses genius all over my office.<eos> These metaphors are getting really disgusting.<eos> You, me, Best Food Friends.<eos> Let's do it!<eos> Ciao, Francesca, how are you?<eos> I'm good.<eos> I'm really good.<eos> How are you?
Let's do it!<eos> Ciao, Francesca, how are you?<eos> I'm good.<eos> I'm really good.<eos> How are you?<eos> I just got some crazy news.<eos> I'm gonna do this new TV show with Chef Jeff where it's just me and him traveling around, eating good food.<eos> I'm done with Clash of the Cupcakes.<eos> That sounds great.<eos> I'm so happy for you.
I'm so happy for you.<eos> How's everything with you?<eos> Well, I have some crazy news too.<eos> Um, I got engaged.<eos> Wow. I'm engaged!<eos> I know!<eos> It's cool.<eos> I mean, I'm so happy.<eos> - Yeah. - Really happy.<eos> I'm happy for you too.
- You done come to the Lord.<eos> - No. I don't know why you keep asking me that.<eos> I'm not... gonna get pregnant because...<eos> I don't like having sex with men.<eos> Have you tried it?<eos> No. Then how you know you don't like it?<eos> It's just something I know.<eos> Well, what you trying to say?<eos> What is the problem?<eos> I'm just annoyed that I even have to have this conversation with you.
- Okay, Grandma.<eos> That's Dev.<eos> Hey.<eos> Friend of Denise's.<eos> No relation to the Watkins.<eos> Yeah, I figured.<eos> Yeah, the whole me-being-Indian thing probably tipped you off.<eos> Fun Denise fact: when we were kids, Denise thought I was black.<eos> Okay. Don't make me break out the Halloween pictures, all right?<eos> Remember when you went as Indian Peter Pan?
I know that's right.<eos> What y'all in here laughing about?<eos> Don't you worry about it.<eos> I'm just gonna take this out.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I think this is gonna be a lovely Thanksgiving, Denise.<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> And, uh, I like Michelle.<eos> I like her, too.<eos> I'm happy for you.
- Great.<eos> So Francesca's coming by, huh?<eos> Interesting.<eos> It's not like that.<eos> She's engaged now.<eos> I turned it off.<eos> Oh, you turned it off, huh?<eos> - Yeah, we're just friends. - Okay.<eos> Well, just be careful, okay?<eos> I'm concerned for you.
Let's party!<eos> Uh, Dev, let's get you inside.<eos> Jeff, let's get you around the back, with your mouth wide open.<eos> Take a massive bite.<eos> Jeff, come on.<eos> - Just one?<eos> - Yeah, come on, just one.<eos> All right.<eos> Come on, guys, let's give him a hand in there.<eos> Let's get you nice, laid out on that bed of tomatoes.
Yeah, with the laser, we can cut anything you want.<eos> And if you have any favorite animals, we can cut it.<eos> Well, I did have a lizard named Lucien that might look cool there.<eos> We have some green jade.<eos> We can put a lizard into the countertop. - Yeah.<eos> Captain's update.<eos> Look at this.<eos> You guys are doing secret texts?<eos> Yes.<eos> Is that you and her dancing?
Here we go.<eos> Autumn in New York. One, two, three.<eos> Uno, due, tre.<eos> - How's it?<eos> Va bene.<eos> Okay, let me...<eos> All right, you got to clean me up.<eos> Okay.<eos> You look cute.<eos> I'm gonna leave you like this with the little leaves around you. - Mm-hmm?
Yes, I think so.<eos> I feel like you should probably start going now, though, no?<eos> I guess you won!<eos> I guess I win.<eos> I won!<eos> You did!<eos> I'm kind of tired.<eos> Can you carry me on your shoulders for a little while?<eos> No. Not at all.<eos> And by the way, I'm the girl. I should be carry-on, not you.
- Sure.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> Uh, Robert Redford... when he was young.<eos> And... Marlon Brando.<eos> When he was alive, obviously.<eos> So two of yours, you'd have to use a time machine.<eos> That's not an ideal list.<eos> No.<eos> Actually, it's not.<eos> What about you?
Oh, my God, she slept over?<eos> Yes!<eos> In my bed! With me!<eos> It was intense.<eos> Wow. Forbidden love.<eos> Arnie's jealous.<eos> I mean, there was definitely moments where I was like, "What is going on here?<eos> Do I just make a move?"<eos> Bro, come on, what are you doing?<eos> She was in your bed with you.
Have a couple drinks, do a little dancing.<eos> You know DJ Arnie's supplying those sexy beats.<eos> That could be good.<eos> Or, I mean, maybe it's better to just have a private conversation in the apartment.<eos> I like that, too.<eos> But either way, you got to talk to her from your heart.<eos> I just... I really don't know how I'd say it.<eos> There's something going on.<eos> I can feel it inside.<eos> And I know you can, too.
Tell me the truth, Francé.<eos> Tell me the truth.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> Wow, this is so cool.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Yeah, it's nice.<eos> Nice? I mean, it's amazing.<eos> Come on, what's going on with you?<eos> Dev, what's wrong with you?<eos> What's wrong is... I'm in love with you, and you're engaged.
Dev, what's wrong with you?<eos> What's wrong is...

We can.<eos> Francesca, it's your life.<eos> You really want to be with Pino? Is that what you want in your heart?<eos> You can't be lukewarm.<eos> What's "lukewarm"?<eos> It means not hot, not cold.<eos> It's in the middle.<eos> I don't want to be lukewarm.<eos> No.<eos> See?

Let me guess.<eos> You broke up with Pino. Everything's okay. And we can continue having a joyous time in New York together.<eos> Dev.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> I feel shit.<eos> I feel horrible. I feel I'm doing something terrible behind his back.<eos> He's a nice person.<eos> He doesn't deserve this.<eos> You know how bad it is just to spend time with you, enjoy the moment, and then go back home, lie in bed with your actual fiancé?
Hey, Dev.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> What's up?<eos> We were just shooting nearby. I thought I'd come say hello.<eos> - Cool.<eos> How are you?<eos> - I'm good.<eos> You know, my skin's lost its mocha glow.<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> I'm sure Graham will hold it down for you.
I have so many things in my head.<eos> I'm still trying to figure out what... What I think, what I want, and...<eos> Like, a month ago I knew everything about me and I knew that I was going to marry Pino and we would have kids and we would probably made a happy family over...<eos> Other there in Italy, in Modena. And then I came here and... And everything changed.<eos> I just don't know what I want anymore.<eos> I don't want to hurt you because I really, really care about you.<eos> Don't even bother.<eos> Don't say it.<eos> I just feel used.<eos> I did not use you.

Dev, really.<eos> Let me go.<eos> Hey, Dev.<eos> Hey, Rachel.<eos> What's up?<eos> Um...<eos> How are you? How is everything?<eos> Um, things are good.<eos> They're, uh, really good.<eos> How are, uh, how are things with you?
You know, I don't even know if it's about her.<eos> I just... I miss that feeling.<eos> When we were together, doing all that stuff...<eos> I felt really connected to somebody.<eos> And it felt good.<eos> Now I just feel fucking alone.<eos> You know what you really need is a distraction, something to get your mind off this.<eos> So don't go home and look at old photos and videos of us being happy together?<eos> I would stop doing that immediately.<eos> But what I want you to do is go home, put on the dumbest movie you can find, and watch that.
Previously on "Colony"...<eos> All I want is what you have in there.<eos> I need today's code.<eos> Our contact has been killed, but, um...<eos> Emergency protocol.<eos> All outlets shift to signal two immediately.<eos> The gauntlet's not the only thing they're looking for.<eos> Their onboard computer had a bunch of dossier files open.<eos> They're looking for you.
I'm staying.<eos> When you get outside, you need to make contact with Noa's people and get this to them.<eos> We sacrificed a lot for it.<eos> It'd be good to know it counted for something.<eos> We'll do everything we can.<eos> Come with us.<eos> The Occupation's gonna be tearing apart the bloc looking for me.<eos> I don't want to disappoint them.<eos> Take care of yourself.<eos> You too.
If you can find a place to hide underground for the next few days, even better.<eos> - Go, go. - Okay.<eos> Let's go, come on.<eos> Him?<eos> No.<eos> No way.<eos> I'm not going with him.<eos> He's our ticket out of here.<eos> You must be Charlie.<eos> Heard a lot about you.
You would have been proud of me.<eos> I managed to turn it all quite deftly to my advantage.<eos> One does need a ruthless streak to succeed in business.<eos> So, I have reason to celebrate.<eos> We should host a party.<eos> We?<eos> Why not?<eos> To launch my new career, to honor our success in battle and to get fully inebriated.<eos> We?<eos> We have a notoriety to maintain, you and I.
Why not?<eos> To launch my new career, to honor our success in battle and to get fully inebriated.<eos> We?<eos> We have a notoriety to maintain, you and I.<eos> And for this, you have the Queen's imprimiture?<eos> As the King, I can do as I please.<eos> I miss you more by the day, my love.<eos> I try to sleep but I can only see your eyes.<eos> I touch your cheek and I kiss your neck, your shoulder, your breasts.<eos> I cannot live without you, my love.
Forgive me.<eos> But, if he is dead, what will you do?<eos> I must pick up the burden.<eos> The burden?<eos> Of ruling.<eos> Ragnar hated it. It weighed him down.<eos> Perhaps it even killed him.<eos> Then why do it to yourself?<eos> I think Ragnar is looking at me, and I can't disappoint him.<eos> Nor can I disappoint myself. Or you. Or Torvi.
Ivar?<eos> - He's a cripple.<eos> - He's a Viking! You made a huge mistake releasing him.<eos> - Don't say that.<eos> - It's true. I mean, don't contradict your father.<eos> I care about your father, and I believe in him.<eos> Yes, I know you do, and I can never totally express my gratitude to you.<eos> But Aethelwulf is right.<eos> The sons of Ragnar will doubtless return to these shores.<eos> And there is no better man than you, my son, to raise an army and make every preparation for our defense.
- Ivar... - Don't touch me, coward.<eos> He is not a coward.<eos> But perhaps he understands some things that you don't.<eos> I understand everything perfectly.<eos> You murdered my mother in cold blood.<eos> I want revenge.<eos> I challenge you to single combat.<eos> I refuse.<eos> You can't refuse.<eos> I refuse to fight you, Ivar Lothbrok, son of Ragnar.
PreviouslyonVikings.<eos> I want to take her with us.<eos> Helga. I am taking her with me!<eos> Where is our father?<eos> King Ecbert handed him over to King Aelle.<eos> Our father is probably dead by now.<eos> And we will have to avenge him.<eos> We have to prepare. The sons of Ragnar will come to claim vengeance.<eos> There is no better man than you to make every preparation for our defense.
We are going to raise an army to invade England and avenge the death of our father.<eos> Will you come with us?<eos> Would you really want me to come with you?<eos> We will need all the help we can get.<eos> After all, don't you have a reason?<eos> I also have a reason to stay here.<eos> I understand you are inviting other rulers to come and join your army.<eos> Don't you think some of them will be envious when they see the size and understand the value of this trading station?<eos> It depends, I suppose, on what is more important to you.<eos> That's not worthy of you, Ubbe.
I didn't know him either.<eos> Turns out his father is an Earl.<eos> An Earl?<eos> Why did you not say so?<eos> Because he's the Earl and I'm not.<eos> They call me Egil the Bastard.<eos> But you would like to be Earl?<eos> It's good that we have met, Egil.<eos> We need ambitious men.<eos> I still have a bone to pick with you, Sigurd.
Because he's the Earl and I'm not.<eos> They call me Egil the Bastard.<eos> But you would like to be Earl?<eos> It's good that we have met, Egil.<eos> We need ambitious men.<eos> I still have a bone to pick with you, Sigurd.<eos> Why were you silent when I demanded justice from Lagertha?<eos> We have different memories of Mother.<eos> She doted on you, and she ignored me.<eos> She had eyes only for you and for Harbard.
So you feel sorry for yourself?<eos> Poor little Sigurd.<eos> You're wrong, Ivar. I don't feel sorry for myself. Yeah.<eos> No. Of course not.<eos> I'm telling you the truth.<eos> I have very good reason not to feel so angry with Lagertha.<eos> Then what kind of a son are you?<eos> What does it matter what your mother did to you?<eos> She was still your mother.<eos> You would say that, wouldn't you?
Are you going to go home?<eos> I know what I have to do.<eos> I want to make you all an offer.<eos> Anyone from our homelands who wants good, rich lands to farm<eos> can come and live in my kingdom.<eos> There will always be a part of Frankia which is a part of us.<eos> Us?<eos> You are no longer a part of "us," Rollo.<eos> But what is "us," Floki, is changing.<eos> Only you won't accept it.
One day you may be King.<eos> I hope so with all my heart.<eos> And yet, I know its burdens.<eos> They're very real, like forever dragging a stone up a hill, only to watch it perpetually roll back down again.<eos> You need to drink more wine.<eos> I don't want any more, Grandfather.<eos> Nonsense, nonsense.<eos> You'll join me in one more.<eos> Now, you keep saying you understand but you obviously don't.<eos> I've just been drinking water, while you were drinking the wine.
And that is what we are going to do.<eos> So you had your revenge?<eos> I'm not saying we shouldn't do it, but think about it.<eos> Welcome home, brother.<eos> I heard you freed Margrethe?<eos> You want to marry her. I'm glad.<eos> Just don't keep her all to yourself.<eos> It's good to have you back, brother.<eos> Have you heard about Mother?<eos> Well, you and I, Ubbe, we jumped under the ice because of her.
It just takes a clever person to figure out where the weak places are.<eos> And are you a clever person, Egil?<eos> Well, I'm not beautiful, am I?<eos> How can you go with Ivar, when he wants to kill your mother?<eos> We're brothers.<eos> We want to kill Aelle.<eos> Nothing else matters right now, woman.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Of course it matters.<eos> It matters to me even if it doesn't matter to you! -

She'll make a good slave, I'm sure.<eos> She is not a slave.<eos> We are adopting her.<eos> She is my child.<eos> Well, let's see.<eos> Shh, it's all right. I won't hurt you.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> It's very sweet of you to drag your crippled arse all the way over here to see me.<eos> Why do you think I want anything from you, you spindly legged, knock-kneed boat-builder?

I won't hurt you.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> It's very sweet of you to drag your crippled arse all the way over here to see me.<eos> Why do you think I want anything from you, you spindly legged, knock-kneed boat-builder?<eos> It's nice to see how much you've matured since I've been away.<eos> Matured?<eos> What, you think I want to be an old fool like you?
In this case?<eos> The blood of a sheep.<eos> I shall return later today.<eos> Do you believe that she's been poisoned?<eos> Nausea, vomiting, general feeling of weakness, thosse are common symptoms, yes.<eos> And do you believe that this is the best course of treatment?<eos> I do.<eos> You better pray you're right!<eos> Because if your not and something happens to her, I would stick that quill right through your eye!<eos> Was it you?
Tell my brother I would like to see him.<eos> I applaud your new passion for the world of commerce. I cannot let personal interests override those of France.<eos> Yours, you mean.<eos> My interests are those of France.<eos> All I can be is King. You still do not seem to understand that.<eos> And all I seek is a place of my own!<eos> A little spot in the corner where I shall not be trampled upon.<eos> It's that too much to ask?<eos> The Canal du Midi serves all of France.<eos> You cannot own it any more than I can.
You know him well.<eos> I know him.<eos> Get to know him better.<eos> I want him to trust you, implicitly.<eos> Why?<eos> Because he's a spy.<eos> Let us through!<eos> You want some?<eos> Yes, I want some.<eos> Are you, Matilde?
Lucky in cards, unlucky in love.<eos> Not so far.<eos> You have a magic touch!<eos> We make quite a team!<eos> I'd call that a handsome morning's work<eos> It's a convincing charade.<eos> It's easier when my orders overlap with my hobbies.<eos> At any rate, he seems to be falling for your charms.<eos> I've yet to meet a man that doesn't.<eos> Make sure you have his trust.
Do you have to rub my nose in it?<eos> It's complicated.<eos> I can't explain it right now.<eos> Maybe this will help you find the right words.<eos> You dare threaten me?<eos> No.<eos> I have a much better idea.<eos> You're bluffing.<eos> You don't even know how to load it properly.<eos> You really want to know how much I feel for you?
Was there someone maybe?<eos> I don't know!<eos> Then you must believe<eos> And you will soon be at the King's side.<eos> How can you be so sure?<eos> Because I have faith.<eos> Long is the road to enlightenment and hard is the way.<eos> I can feel my enemies' breath on the back of my neck.<eos> Find them.<eos> Here I am before You.
Something is wrong?<eos> What makes you say that?<eos> Your expression. I can't read it.<eos> I spent a lifetime perfecting that particular skill.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> A wife should never ask her husband that question.<eos> The answer will always disappoint.<eos> You frighten me.<eos> Oh, I'm not the one to fear.<eos> A girl like you should be more careful in her choice of lover.
I was following your little shit!<eos> Why?<eos> Because I wanted to discuss the weather over Armagnac and macaroons.<eos> What do you think?<eos> You're making it worse!<eos> Why won't you let me help you?<eos> Because this is your fault!<eos> I'm going back right now and kill him properly this time!<eos> You can't!<eos> I have my honor to think of and so should you!
To be continued.<eos> Say cheese, and post.<eos> Hey, how about a movie tonight?<eos> Keep moving, Magilla.<eos> The base is ours.<eos> So, what were you saying before we were interrupted?<eos> I...<eos> Okay, good a place as any.<eos> I got an apartment in the city.<eos> I hoped, maybe, we could share, you know, together.
Get off me!<eos> You were shaking everything, Terra.<eos> We came to check on you.<eos> - Are you all right?<eos> - It's a freaking nightmare.<eos> Just leave me alone.<eos> I'm okay, so, get going.<eos> You heard me.<eos> Get going.<eos> You too, Greeny.
You heard me.<eos> Get going.<eos> You too, Greeny.<eos> - Does that happen a lot?<eos> - It happens enough.<eos> - What did you see? - Nothing.<eos> And if I did see anything, it wouldn't be your business.<eos> Everything that goes on in the tower is my business.<eos> Just like it should be for all of you.<eos> The last I checked, Damien, Kori was in charge, not you.
Too long.<eos> Don't make this weirder than it already is, Blood.<eos> Are you referring to the setting?<eos> I myself take strength from it.<eos> The cemetery isn't a place to be feared.<eos> It's a place of renewal.<eos> I have no problem meeting anywhere you want but I get concerned when my employer talks to himself.<eos> I talk to the dead, for no matter how rotted the corpse there's always a tiny wisp of life left.<eos> Sometimes enough life to bring them back.<eos> You of all people should know that.
Guess we know who's taking out the garbage at the new place.<eos> That was not a confidence booster.<eos> You did very well.<eos> You lasted far longer this time.<eos> I meant in training, of course.<eos> He's very proficient when we have...<eos> Kori!<eos> Blue Beetle, Raven.<eos> - Sorry, Raven, the bug doesn't wanna lose.<eos> - And you do?
Your friends have made you soft.<eos> Like I said, soft.<eos> Took you long enough.<eos> You betrayed us, why?<eos> Betrayed?<eos> That assumes I was ever on your side in the first place.<eos> There you go, Mr. Fernandez.<eos> - Great to have your help.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - No. Thank you.
The contract is everything.<eos> We need total concentration for it.<eos> You know it's taken a lot of work to get here.<eos> Especially by you.<eos> I don't wanna go back.<eos> The Titans are always acting like they care so much.<eos> It messes with my head.<eos> Just a little longer, Terra.<eos> With the money from Blood we'll form our own league of assassins.<eos> You and I.
Together in every way.<eos> I didn't see you bringing quite so many weapons to our new place.<eos> - If you don't like them...<eos> - No, no. They're great.<eos> Is something up?<eos> After the incident at the training field you met with members of the team without me.<eos> Yeah, we talked.<eos> But it wasn't a meeting.<eos> Kori, you know I'd never undermine you, right?<eos> They went to you.
But I could teach you some meditation techniques.<eos> It might help you stay in control.<eos> Maybe. Maybe so.<eos> The other reason I'm here is to tell you the team's assembling in the common room.<eos> I need a minute. You go on ahead.<eos> - They know about Robin.<eos> - They don't.<eos> Raven, being nice?<eos> And there's nothing scheduled.<eos> They know I'm working with you.
I don't need your pity.<eos> It can be a bond, you know?<eos> - Everyone on the team's had it rough.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I can tell Princess Sparkle Thong knows all about eating from a dumpster.<eos> Kori is a refugee being stalked by her homicidal sister.<eos> - Jaime has a family that loves him.<eos> - And, because of the bug odds are he's never seeing them face-to-face again.<eos> I think pain is what makes a hero.<eos> It's like a pressure that either forms a diamond or grinds you into dust.

You don't know anything about him.<eos> He saved me.<eos> Let me guess, he kept you isolated.<eos> Dependent.<eos> Told you everyone was your enemy.<eos> Trained you, ruthlessly.<eos> And promised you exactly what you wanted.<eos> Believe me, I know.<eos> I've always hated you.<eos> You and all the others.
You threaten her, too?<eos> I don't even... wait.<eos> The bitch from the jury?<eos> The bitch be dead.<eos> Are you accusing me?<eos> She did put your homie away.<eos> Now first you say I threatened Ricardo to keep him from ratting me out, then I whack a juror for locking him up?<eos> That don't make sense together.<eos> - Who's stupid now?<eos> - Still you.
Your Honor, there doesn't seem to be a point to this questioning.<eos> Good job, Sam.<eos> I happen to agree with the defense, Mr. Stone.<eos> Refusing to allow the child to communicate with his mother was part of the defendant's pattern of abusive behavior.<eos> He just testified that he spoke to his mother through Snapchat.<eos> Fine.<eos> Then I move to examine the phone.<eos> It's irrelevant.<eos> You opened the door, Ms. Sharp.<eos> Do you have your phone with you, son?
Listen, I'm gonna be late back here tonight, so... here.<eos> - In case you need a place to crash.<eos> That's very--<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hopefully, I'll get my shit together.<eos> Yeah, just give me a second. I'm just stepping out.<eos> - What's up, man? How are you?<eos> - I'm good, I'm good.<eos> Just, uh... doing the work, you know?<eos> Good, man, good for you.
You came to the right place.<eos> We can help you.<eos> WAKE can help you.<eos> What?<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> - This is your store, huh? - Thank you.<eos> Thank you, yeah.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Dude, I gotta get a picture of you next to that sign, man, come on.
Uh, who's-- who's "we"?<eos> "We" are us.<eos> I just thought since you're a skilled carpenter, you could help out.<eos> So when you said "we" you meant "me"?<eos> I'm helping you, as your sponsor.<eos> This is a chance for you to be of service to others.<eos> - So are you my sponsor or my employer?<eos> - Sponsor, definitely.<eos> I'm not paying you.<eos> Look, this is just an opportunity for you to, you know, show up. Do the work. Make amends.
Yeah.<eos> I wanna talk to, uh... Karel.<eos> About what?<eos> About Alex. Alex, man.<eos> Her-- her whole deal has just, like, stirred up a bunch of emotions and I wanna get his take on it.<eos> - You haven't even met her, man.<eos> - Yeah. Yeah, I know.<eos> That's one of the things I wanna get his take on.<eos> Oh, but, I will say this.<eos> If you and London want, like, a little romantic spot, you can take the Minnie Winnie.
You'll be right there. It's right there.<eos> - Oh, okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Hey, Chip.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Hey, man.<eos> How you doing, Chip?<eos> - Hey, hey!<eos> - Good to see you, brother.<eos> Is this you?
- It's true.<eos> - You lied.<eos> You wanted me to think that she was a he.<eos> No, I--<eos> I wanted you to not think she was a she.<eos> - You lied.<eos> - I lied.<eos> What did she mean, "Are you even in your first year?"<eos> Look, I stayed here last night and...<eos> - she wanted to-- - Fuck you.
Hey, weren't you just here?<eos> Let's go.<eos> 14-10.<eos> We have a tow truck carrying a Jetta heading.<eos> West on Third Street towards San Pedro.<eos> Requesting backup.<eos> Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!<eos> Taking this intersection.<eos> Riggs, Riggs, Riggs, hang back!<eos> Would you relax, okay?
Interlace your fingers behind your neck.<eos> You're supposed to be getting rest.<eos> You're not supposed to be here.<eos> Like hell I'm not.<eos> Come on.<eos> We're not staying for fries.<eos> It's not his first rodeo;<eos> He's not gonna talk until his attorney gets here.<eos> Don't try to change the subject.<eos> You didn't want to take me with you to get your boy Dino, because of... what the doctor said about me taking it easy.
Don't try to change the subject.<eos> You didn't want to take me with you to get your boy Dino, because of... what the doctor said about me taking it easy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's right.<eos> He didn't want you to overexert yourself, so I took one for the team... again.<eos> We're partners, man.<eos> We follow leads together.<eos> Don't you understand the concept of...<eos> The question is,<eos> - do you?
It's about me getting a car.<eos> I'll go check out the Ford Escape.<eos> Look, Trish, how many times do I have to say it?<eos> I'm sorry I didn't tell you.<eos> I just didn't want you to worry.<eos> What if you had died, Roger?<eos> Then we wouldn't be having this fight.<eos> When do your test results get back?<eos> - Tomorrow.<eos> - The LAPD can survive without you.
There's a known criminal on the loose, and our son may need to escape<eos> - danger. - That criminal is too smart to steal a car from the cops and then hide his bad guy costume in an open locker. Brenda?<eos> Can you tell us about the intelligent features?<eos> - We need that right now.<eos> - How would you explain all the evidence stacked up against him?<eos> I don't have to explain it.<eos> You're the detective.<eos> Detect.<eos> You know what I detect is a very nasty attitude and a lot of neck<eos> - coming from you. - Okay.
What did you want me to do?<eos> Would you like me to lie?<eos> I was under oath, Roger.<eos> It's all right.<eos> She would've found out anyway.<eos> That woman is relentless.<eos> The DNA belongs to Dino's brother, Jerry.<eos> Damn.<eos> Now I got to tell her she was right.<eos> You want me to... want me to go with you?
Okay? I gave him one simple job.<eos> Just drive from one place to another.<eos> But he stopped for pizza, parked in a red zone, and he got $2 million of my cocaine impounded.<eos> Then, then he tried to steal the car out of the impound, and he lost the drugs again.<eos> He owes me that money.<eos> I guess you better talk to him then.<eos> No, no, no, see, I'm done talkin'.<eos> You've inherited his debt.<eos> Like hell.<eos> I took the heat for you once.
Trish is on your side, all right?<eos> She's trying to help you.<eos> But she's not gonna be able to if you go do something like this.<eos> Sorry, man.<eos> Look, Dino, you've been working really hard to clean up your life, right?<eos> It'd be a shame for it to end all right here.<eos> They kidnapped my brother.<eos> Okay? And they will kill him if I don't pay up.<eos> So let me help you, all right?<eos> But start by lowering this weapon before I take it and feed it to you.
Fine.<eos> Remember your promise.<eos> Thanks, Trish.<eos> All right, so we'll go to the evidence room...<eos> - We get the drugs back...<eos> - Exchange 'em for Jerry...<eos> And we bust Angelo.<eos> We are adorable.<eos> So you must be the famous Monty.<eos> You his partner?
Let's go.<eos> You keep it simple.<eos> You stole the drugs from a crooked cop.<eos> One look at him...<eos> - it's gonna be a easy sell.<eos> - All right.<eos> Cuffs, por favor.<eos> You know, I'm gonna start charging you for these.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Hey, Dino, make sure you get Angelo on tape accepting the drugs,
Okay.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I feel like I let you down.<eos> You did what you had to do.<eos> I will never forget how you cared enough to put time into me, I swear.<eos> All I can say is thank you for looking out for me once again.<eos> - Thanks for trusting me. - Hey.<eos> Thank you for being someone that I could trust.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm proud of you.
Well, let's try to not let it ruin the rest of our trip.<eos> I knew we should've never mentioned us living together in the first place.<eos> She was gonna find out eventually.<eos> Disagree.<eos> We've known about evolution since 1859.<eos> She still believes in Noah and his amazing zoo boat.<eos> This could have all been avoided if you'd only listened to me.<eos> Sheldon, I knew your mother was fine with us living together because I already told her we were.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> This was a potential issue, so I got out ahead of it and I managed the situation for you.
Well, there's really not much left to tell.<eos> I decided that my mother views me as a child because I never went through a rebellious phase, so, I got an earring.<eos> My mother made me take it out.<eos> Amy put alcohol on it.<eos> And here we are.<eos> What did we miss?<eos> I couldn't explain it if I tried.<eos> So tell me, how did Sheldon look with an earring?<eos> Like the pirate who helps the other pirates connect to the Internet.<eos> So what did you and Leonard do?
It's like I'm married to an old piece of fruit.<eos> Look, we could keep fighting and let it ruin our night, or-or we can stop and try to salvage the evening.<eos> Fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> There's something on the windshield.<eos> You need a break?<eos> Do not need a break.<eos> There's no shame in asking for a break.<eos> If I need a break, I'll ask for a break!<eos> There's a tree on you.
It worked.<eos> Well, I'd say that's thinking outside the box,<eos> Don't make me laugh.<eos> Do you need help getting out?<eos> I think I live here now.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Is it okay if I get some sleep?<eos> Yeah, go ahead.<eos> Good job, Mommy.<eos> I'm proud of you.
Impressive.<eos> You both work for the FBI, too?<eos> Sure.<eos> Any idea who she is?<eos> That's Ellen Briggs.<eos> What was her connection to the academy?<eos> Ellen was in the Army.<eos> She visited once a semester to talk about her work serving abroad.<eos> Spent a lot of time in Africa, the Middle East.<eos> And she took a real interest in you.
Out you get!<eos> Quick!<eos> If she wanted you dead, you would be.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Penelope!<eos> Penelope's dead.<eos> Your sister, she's dead.<eos> I just found her again!<eos> After all that time, I can't let it happen again!<eos> You're ill.

God knows I should be, growing up here.<eos> It was a house of monsters.<eos> But the men who came to visit your father were heroes, as was he.<eos> The only monster in that house was you.<eos> I read your sister's diary.<eos> - She was terrified of you.<eos> - I'd never hurt Penelope!<eos> The only way to get away was by drowning!<eos> She drowned herself to get away from you.<eos> - You forced her to it.
Breathe.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Breathe, you bastard!<eos> It was in Tessa Knight's handbag.<eos> Beyond hurting her now.<eos> It's evidence.<eos> Castle'll get what he's got coming, with this or without.<eos> It wouldn't harm your prospects any if you found it'd slipped down the back of your sofa.<eos> But that wouldn't be true.<eos> You don't have to stay in Oxford.
Yeah.<eos> Right?<eos> Jesus.<eos> Jesus fuck!<eos> That was definitely a gunshot.<eos> Where are we gonna go?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe the dorms? Hide under the covers until it's over.<eos> 'Cause prison blankets are so bulletproof.<eos> You went off book.
That was definitely a gunshot.<eos> Where are we gonna go?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe the dorms? Hide under the covers until it's over.<eos> 'Cause prison blankets are so bulletproof.<eos> You went off book.<eos> Did you hear something?<eos> The sound of you fucking up.<eos> I did the right thing.<eos> Oh, you're so sure about that, huh?
The sound of you fucking up.<eos> I did the right thing.<eos> Oh, you're so sure about that, huh?<eos> What, your vast PR experience led you to that conclusion?<eos> And you were ready to send that kid to prison for...<eos> Killing someone.<eos> Shall we go over the facts again?<eos> You should start working on your résumé.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You should... go back to the tight suit store. Mind your own business.
Dead men can't point fingers.<eos> This feels good.<eos> Right?<eos> If you kill him, you probably gonna have to kill her, too.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Please, I don't know anything.<eos> I didn't see anything.<eos> They don't seem to care about our lives, so why we gotta give a shit if they live or die?<eos> I do. I do. I care so much.<eos> Should I finish him off, or you two gonna kick him to death?
- Artesian McCullough.<eos> - Artesian?<eos> It's a town in South Dakota.<eos> McCullough here.<eos> Uh, shots fired by Humps.<eos> Guy's going nuts, full-on Sandy Hook.<eos> Hide. Ahhh!<eos> Not bad, huh?<eos> Yo, seriously?<eos> Are you not paying attention here?
Throw a dog a bone.<eos> God's sake.<eos> Here you go.<eos> No funny stuff.<eos> Fine.<eos> Piece of shit.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Hold up! Hold up.<eos> No, we're closed. Closed.<eos> Yeah, well, I need padlocks, all the locks you got, and anything else that's good for barricading.
Okay, so great. Huh?<eos> Moving forward.<eos> No, wait.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Hey, fool!<eos> Fool follower!<eos> - We got here first. - Yeah!<eos> Buzz off!<eos> You really think you're gonna be able to chew through that steel with your meth teeth?
He can't die on us... or that's a murder charge.<eos> He can't die. Please.<eos> It's not for him. It's for me.<eos> Did you do this?<eos> No, but...<eos> Yo, his skin be going all gray like he's cloudy and overcast.<eos> For you.<eos> Not for him.<eos> Find me some disinfectant and something like gauze, some tweezers.<eos> And honestly, if you still got drugs around here, you might wanna give him a taste.
I gotta shut this fucking alarm, and I can't reach my people.<eos> Where'd you put it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Didn't your assistant pack everything up?<eos> Right.<eos> Move outta the way.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Label makers.<eos> Empty goddamn Good Plenty boxes.<eos> Some organization you run.
Move outta the way.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Label makers.<eos> Empty goddamn Good Plenty boxes.<eos> Some organization you run.<eos> Ran.<eos> Oh, you got a problem with how I do shit, pretty boy?<eos> Taystee?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm telling the real story, 'cause you sure the hell didn't.
Hey, you ever been whacked in the head full force with a chair leg?<eos> Yeah, see, and this screw right here looks pretty rusty.<eos> I think you gonna need a shot for tetanus if you live.<eos> Oh, hell no.<eos> Stay the fuck down, Captain America, or you ain't never making' babies.<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> Are you insane?<eos> No, she's angry.<eos> We're all angry.<eos> You done our girl wrong, Mr. Caputo, and you gonna fix it.

Lie there and ride it out.<eos> We're all going to die.<eos> Thanks for that.<eos> Why isn't this thing working?<eos> They cut all the phones and TVs so we couldn't hear the news and get mad.<eos> And that's working great, huh?<eos> What if there's actually an emergency?<eos> Like a fire or something?<eos> Listen to me. There ain't no fire. There's a guard out there going full-on San Bernardino.<eos> This is where you want to be.
Fucking guards. What's up, bitches?<eos> What you gonna do?<eos> Uh, what do we do now?<eos> - We get his keys.<eos> - But how?<eos> Distraction.<eos> Show him your tits and I'll get the keys, and then we run.<eos> Look at this fat guy. He can't outrun us.<eos> Jesus!<eos> Hey, what you doing on the floor?
How you doing?<eos> You didn't see me.<eos> No, 'course not.<eos> Do you want a snack or something?<eos> Yeah, I'll take some Twizzlers if you got.<eos> Yeah, we have Twizzlers.<eos> You forgot salty.<eos> Now he doesn't have the magic combination.<eos> Idiot.<eos> This where you're keeping guards?
Idiot.<eos> This where you're keeping guards?<eos> We got a big one here for you.<eos> Hey, Daya, we need you again. We gotta open the door.<eos> Oh, what about Bang Bang?<eos> No, that's the kid from Flintstones.<eos> That's no good.<eos> What?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Mmm? You talkin' about me?
- How about Sexy Ass? - Uh...<eos> But then no one's gonna know how hard she is, yo.<eos> - Cold Ass Diaz?<eos> - Get off the ass track.<eos> How about Dominator?<eos> The Dominator.<eos> Too kinky.<eos> You know, you can't keep shooting things down without pitching.<eos> Now, you gonna read the words just like they written.<eos> You hear me?
See?<eos> Blue.<eos> You are such an asshole.<eos> You really gotta learn to trust more.<eos> Okay, we're ready.<eos> He looks shiny.<eos> Man, this ain't a beauty pageant.<eos> Go.<eos> Read.<eos> You best be getting to work.
Bring it closer.<eos> It's like I got all this energy, you know?<eos> Will you slow down? You got longer legs than me.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no! I have to get out of here!<eos> Shit.<eos> I haven't finished securing that side yet.<eos> There.<eos> Now it's locked up good.<eos> Wait.<eos> If you're collecting guards, there's that one from electrical hiding out in the front office.
Okay, I got an idea, all right?<eos> Let's all take a chill pill.<eos> Literally. Now, I'm gonna come in there, I'm gonna open the gate, we're all gonna swallow something wonderful.<eos> And then, we're gonna have a nice, civilized discussion.<eos> You are not taking any pills.<eos> I know.<eos> I know, okay? I won't.<eos> Just... just follow my lead here.<eos> Okay, but I wanna hold the keys.<eos> What are you whispering about?

- Thanks for bringing him in.<eos> If you got this, I'm gonna go check on Daya, okay?<eos> You're gonna need some help.<eos> I was a firema... firefighter.<eos> Well, great.<eos> I'll take all the help I can get.<eos> Okay, you need to lose the shoes.<eos> The... the deal was for my bag and my phone, and I think that that's more than fair.<eos> These were not on sale, and your feet look much bigger than mine.<eos> You can keep your shoes.
I'd do it myself, but this one's a handful. Aren't you?<eos> That's for throwing the scissors at my head.<eos> You lucky I got a thick skull.<eos> - That's me, lucky.<eos> - Hey, can I have her jacket?<eos> - Give her your jacket.<eos> - What?<eos> No, it... It goes with my dress.<eos> It's an outfit.<eos> It makes you look boxy, so give it up.
Ooh, I wanna see those.<eos> All right, so... how do I post it?<eos> Man, where do I post it?<eos> I got an old Myspace account.<eos> Still might work.<eos> Snapchat.<eos> I hear it's all about Snapchat now.<eos> What? Why'd you make that snort noise?<eos> Snapchat is a closed system, and it only lasts a limited time.<eos> But if you tweet with a hashtag and a link, it goes to Facebook, Instagram, etcetera.

You're gonna want a quick, catchy clickbait.<eos> All right, something to really grab the liberal market.<eos> - That's who you want to appeal to. - Why are you helping them?
- That's who you want to appeal to. - Why are you helping them?<eos> Because their message still exonerates MCC, so what the hell do I care?<eos> Bad apple guard.<eos> Sympathetic victim.<eos> Justice will be served.<eos> That's what I've been trying to convey since the beginning.<eos> He was a kid who was under-trained, in over his head, who made a grave and terrible mistake.<eos> See, that's not good for MCC.<eos> He was a kid who killed my friend.<eos> My friend, who was a person, and you didn't say her name or nothing about her.
"Count." That's funny.<eos> There ain't no count.<eos> - We in charge now.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. What are you talking about?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> He don't know.<eos> Why you think the alarm was going off, and the lights and everything?<eos> Riot.<eos> Okay, upload this on the Twitter.<eos> You need an account.
How long do you think this riot of yours can last?<eos> As long as it takes.<eos> For what to happen, exactly?<eos> - I don't know, for Bayley to get arrested.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. - For the guards to get fired.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. - For the food to get better.<eos> For classes and better jobs, and maybe, like, basic dignity. Mmm-hmm.<eos> We should write this shit down.<eos> Not good for MCC.<eos> Barring the arrest... I hope you get everything you want.

I hope you get everything you want.<eos> I've never been able to make a difference here.<eos> Maybe you'll have better luck.<eos> Maybe so.<eos> But if you know anything about the history of riots, you know they don't end well. - They never end well.<eos> - Uh-uh. We, we're gonna get it done.<eos> I hope you do.
You know, this was delicious, by the way.<eos> You know, a hint of cinnamon, vanilla bean.<eos> Delightful!<eos> Uh, anyone mind if I drink this one, too?<eos> You've had enough caffeine.<eos> All right.<eos> Go to my bag, get my hotspot.<eos> I'll upload for you.<eos> Now, would somebody please untie my hands so that I can type and hold my own dick?<eos> Oh, come on. You no fun.
And she's older.<eos> Look, Al, I don't want to not lay low, but I also don't want to lose my humanity.<eos> Again.<eos> I'm in an amends for bad behavior phase.<eos> Fine.<eos> But the minute she gets risky for us, we are ditching her ass.<eos> - Okay. - Get changed.<eos> Welcome to Litchfield, inmate...<eos> Ibrahim?<eos> No, you need to make up a different name.
- Oh, hello. We're in here.<eos> You know if the phone works?<eos> Oh! Merry Christmas.<eos> It does.<eos> You need to leave now.<eos> We're kind of in the middle of something, huh?<eos> We can do this later.<eos> Do you mind if we take this with us?<eos> And... and these?<eos> Do whatever you want.
473 straight. Your mommy must miss you.<eos> She does, but I have family here.<eos> Yeah, the kind that teases him 'cause his mommy misses him.<eos> This is one of our newest crew members, Miranda North...<eos> From the Centers for Disease Control.<eos> She is a doctor too.<eos> Yeah, I'm winning. We have another question from 7 year old Layla.<eos> We think this question is a little personal.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> - How do you go to the bathroom?
- Yeah.<eos> Have you got a name yet?<eos> - For that we wanna go down live... just outside our studio in Times Square, to one very brave class mate.<eos> - Hi, Dominique.<eos> - Hi. Calvin Coolidge Elementary... was chosen among 11,000 schools... for this honor.<eos> We name the Martian... after our school.<eos> "Calvin".<eos> Control?<eos> Control?<eos> If you're listening, and you probably are cause you're creepy that way...
I have to fix this.<eos> Good. You ready?<eos> - Stretch.<eos> - Okay.<eos> And... relax.<eos> Ready.<eos> - You sure it won't hurt it?<eos> - It's a very very low voltage.<eos> We're only stimulating it.<eos> - What exactly are you hoping for?
Initiating emergency escape sequence in 5... 4... 3... 2... 1.<eos> Come on, Miranda, get going.<eos> Initiating manual override.<eos> This is Dr. Miranda North, black box recording, in case of death upon re-entry.<eos> The creature killed four of the six ISS astronauts with fifth, Dr. David Jordan, presumed dead, carrying it out into deep space.<eos> My five colleagues all sacrificed themselves to maintain the firewalls.<eos> Please, honor them for giving everything to this cause.<eos> Mars life forms should be considered hostile.<eos> Do not underestimate their intelligence and their adaptive capabilities.<eos> Now we did not learn how to restrain or eliminate it... and if this creature ever reaches Earth... use every available resource to destroy it... or you will risk all human life.
- Somebody!<eos> - There's gotta be someone in this motherfucking goddamn magical forest.<eos> - Get up.<eos> People are dying.<eos> - Hungry, I assume?<eos> After all that being chased?<eos> - No, um, I'm not being chased.<eos> - Oh. - Usually they're being chased.<eos> - That I know of, no.<eos> - But you do need some kind of help.
After all that being chased?<eos> - No, um, I'm not being chased.<eos> - Oh. - Usually they're being chased.<eos> - That I know of, no.<eos> - But you do need some kind of help.<eos> - Uh, it's just where I come from there's a legend about a witch with a cottage made of candy.<eos> - Well, the cottage is mostly wood, and I'm more of a healer and... Gardening enthusiast.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I need your help.<eos> - And you're offering...?

- no, he's right.<eos> It's Julia's fault. - No, guys.<eos> - She... she's not sane.<eos> - You think? - One small consolation is the bitch is with the beast right now, and I can't really see that going her way.<eos> - No, it, uh, I'll explain it in a second.<eos> Um, can I have my blood back, please?<eos> - Look, my friends, they're fine.<eos> - I don't need your...<eos> - no. I took an hour out of my night.<eos> You're in Fillory, magician.
- I have no idea what to do now.<eos> - So we are fucked without grease.<eos> - That sounds like us.<eos> - Must be a Monday.<eos> Onward to glory.<eos> - Ah, much better.<eos> - Why are... are we...<eos> - ah, the food is tremendous.<eos> Let's sit.<eos> - You familiar?
Let's sit.<eos> - You familiar?<eos> - Word as bond?<eos> Uh, I assume the extra bits enchant the blade to kill me instantly in the event I break it, eh.<eos> - Okay, here's the deal...<eos> - you need to kill a god.<eos> Thrilling.<eos> So you need to get near him.<eos> - Tricky.<eos> - Yes, but you can help.
- Okay, here's the deal...<eos> - you need to kill a god.<eos> Thrilling.<eos> So you need to get near him.<eos> - Tricky.<eos> - Yes, but you can help.<eos> - Mm. - His... Name is Reynard the fox.<eos> - A trickster of some sorts, yes?<eos> Oh, that will be a challenge.<eos> - Well, you don't really have much choice, do you?
- Mm. - His... Name is Reynard the fox.<eos> - A trickster of some sorts, yes?<eos> Oh, that will be a challenge.<eos> - Well, you don't really have much choice, do you?<eos> - Oh, well aware you have that stylish little blade.<eos> - I sure do.<eos> - That reminds me to insist the terms of our deal include said blade reverting to me at the moment of Reynard's demise.<eos> - Agreed?<eos> - Almost.<eos> First, for the duration of our agreement, you do not hurt or act against me in any way.

- Souvenir?<eos> - Barometer.<eos> Thought I should pay attention to see if it gets warm.<eos> - Whoa. Hey, guys.<eos> Hey, over here!<eos> - Oh, my god, those horses are so beautiful.<eos> - Uh, hey. - What are you doing?<eos> - I just really love horses.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - You have got to be kidding me.
Well, so I guess we came for not much.<eos> - On the contrary, we've verified what attracts Reynard. - What?<eos> - Witches doing rituals?<eos> I mean, that's thousands of people every day.<eos> - Not this type of ritual.<eos> Come on.<eos> - So, what do I do?<eos> - Well, per the books, you strip and jump in, I guess.<eos> Here, I'll help you.<eos> - You'll need to help him sew those back on his wrists.
- This guy is fucking weird.<eos> - Go on.<eos> Go. Go, go.<eos> You know, you're very beautiful.<eos> Where are you from, hmm?<eos> Earth?<eos> Love women from earth.<eos> - Is it supposed to take this long? - No.<eos> - He may have drowned.<eos> - Are you kidding?

Love women from earth.<eos> - Is it supposed to take this long? - No.<eos> - He may have drowned.<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> - Why didn't you...<eos> - oh, oh, oh. - There we go.<eos> Are you sure I can't interest you in an elixir?<eos> It... it's small batch and very fresh.<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> - I have a tooth powder that I think you are going to love.

Pleasure to serve.<eos> - I think he wants a tip.<eos> - 20 gold pieces is customary.<eos> - Okay, that sounds like a lot.<eos> - Well, this is Chatwin's torrent.<eos> - We don't have...<eos> - There was nothing about charging in the books.<eos> - Oh, uh, you'd rather pay in labor?<eos> I think three to five years.<eos> - Are you fucking kidding me?

Good luck.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - He gets touchy.<eos> It's... it's not personal.<eos> Um, these are diamond.<eos> - What the hell is diamond?<eos> - Here.<eos> - When you meet one scammer, you met 'em all. Let's go.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay, so this net... - This net you throw, what sort of a net catches a god?
They're just healing.<eos> - Do you think he's sleeping or dead?<eos> I don't know, should we just go into the trunk?<eos> - Oh, pussies.<eos> - He looks dead.<eos> - I guess we're late.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> I am the knight of crowns.<eos> Uh, my apologies.<eos> I seem to have died waiting for you aspirants to come.
I seem to have died waiting for you aspirants to come.<eos> Y-y-you are aspirants?<eos> Uh... I'm the high king of Fillory.<eos> I took a blood test.<eos> - Excellent, excellent.<eos> - It's an honor.<eos> - Can we have the crowns, please?<eos> - Certainly.<eos> - Honored to oblige.<eos> Just as soon as you pass the test.

- Come at me.<eos> - What popular American television program stars actor Tim Daly?<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> - He was in a lot of TV shows.<eos> - There is only one correct answer.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Give me the next question.<eos> - This hit single is performed by offspring of famous entertainers.<eos> - Dude, that is crazy vague.<eos> - You will receive a single hint.
"Hold on" by Wilson Phillips.<eos> - That song is my jam.<eos> - Wait, all these questions are from the '90s.<eos> - It... it's not the 1990s on earth right now?<eos> - No, it... it's 2017.<eos> Oh, and it's, uh, "wings," the... the Tim Daly show. "Wings."<eos> - Of course you know that.<eos> - Okay, '90s.<eos> Ask me something about Patrick Swayze.<eos> - You know of Swayze?
If you're powerful, you will survive.<eos> - So what, you're suggesting I just get over it?<eos> - Actually, yes.<eos> - How?<eos> - Mutate?<eos> Take over a world, kill a bunch of grad students 39 times?<eos> Eh, see, what you feel, the haunted look in your eyes, doesn't come from nowhere.<eos> - Then where does it come from?<eos> - In the center of your being, there's a tiny beating heart.<eos> - What, you mean like my soul?
- Eliot!<eos> The crown suits you, of course.<eos> - Who are all these people?<eos> - The Pickwick family.<eos> They've been running things till children of earth came.<eos> - Your highness.<eos> Tick Pickwick of the northern marsh Pickwicks, at your service.<eos> The rest of the king's council will arrive shortly.<eos> - Great.<eos> - So glad you're here.
- Can I help you?<eos> - Hell, yes, you can. - These don't work.<eos> - Well, by all means, request a refund.<eos> - Very funny. - You did this on purpose.<eos> - Did what?<eos> Help an ungrateful child of earth?<eos> - Look, I'll pay you whatever you want, okay?<eos> I'm... I'm serious, okay?<eos> I'm friends with the kings and queens.<eos> You want to be a Duke, great, I got you...
How're you?<eos> - 'I'm fine.<eos> So, excited? '<eos> Can't you hear the excitement in my voice?<eos> 'Rohan, please be there at 10:45 am, okay? '<eos> I'll be there on time.<eos> Please don't worry. - 'Okay.'<eos> But Mrs. Mukherjee, it would be nice to have you there too.<eos> It was you who fixed this.<eos> So, I was thinking if you could meet, it would be really nice.
What is with the new clothes?<eos> - Should I send some cake over?<eos> Sure..<eos> Moron!<eos> I knew that love is blind.<eos> But this is the first time I see blind people falling in love.<eos> - I know, it is simple but I can't do it.. - Very simple! - Yes, please.<eos> Is Supriya here?<eos> - Yes, she's there.<eos> Can you please..
Rohan..<eos> - One second!<eos> Rohan! - Su..<eos> - Rohan!<eos> Just a minute, sir.<eos> - R-Rohan!<eos> Su!<eos> Why are you all pushing?<eos> Rohan!<eos> - What are you doing?
Vikram!<eos> Vikram!<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Can you help me, please?<eos> Just a minute, guys.<eos> Security.<eos> I have been trying to find my friend for a while now.<eos> She is lost.<eos> Can you help me?<eos> You have a mic. So, if you could..
- These boys are bothering us.<eos> But there is no one here except you two.<eos> But they were right here.<eos> Rohan, where are they?<eos> - They left, Su.<eos> They left.<eos> R-Rohan..<eos> Let's go home.<eos> Look, I don't care about that.<eos> While booking the flat, you know what you had said? 'Yes, I do.'

What are you doing, Su?<eos> I am doing what I should have done last night when you slapped that guy.<eos> Then why didn't you?<eos> Sorry.. Sorry!<eos> Supriya!<eos> Good morning!<eos> - Good morning, ma'am.<eos> What is this?<eos> - Actually, my fridge isn't working.<eos> Can you please keep this milk in your fridge?
You..<eos> - Rohan..<eos> Rohan!<eos> The hospital is here.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> Your report is ready.<eos> The doctor will see you now.<eos> Mr. Bhatnagar, do not expect much from this report.<eos> The 24 hours following the molestation are the most critical for evidence.<eos> You have showed up after 30 hours, that too, drenched.
You have showed up after 30 hours, that too, drenched.<eos> All evidence seems to have been washed away.<eos> What! They kidnapped you and locked you up? And then left you in the sea?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Do you have a witness?<eos> Tell me!<eos> - Witness?<eos> Do you take me for a fool?<eos> I understand everything.<eos> You people are very cunning.
Yes.<eos> - Do you have a witness?<eos> Tell me!<eos> - Witness?<eos> Do you take me for a fool?<eos> I understand everything.<eos> You people are very cunning.<eos> Ma'am..<eos> Are you really molested? Or are you just making up..<eos> - What are you saying?

I will charge you with defamation and fraud.<eos> Where is Mr. Chaube?<eos> I need to speak to him.<eos> - Sir is busy.<eos> And what do you want to speak to him about?<eos> Talk to me first.<eos> Look at this!<eos> 'No clinical evidence of rape.' It says here, clearly!<eos> You guys are frauds.<eos> You filed a complaint of molestation and then, disappeared for 24 hours.

"Every moment I spent with you" "has gone up in the smoke of this fire."<eos> "These ashes that are left" "of my wishes, now ask me"<eos> "if I am capable of your love" "or not.."<eos> "I am capable of your love" "or not.."<eos> Look, I should go to the garage for some time.<eos> But you must finish eating this, before I am back.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Your wife looked beautiful.<eos> I am Corporate Madhavrao Shellar Amit's older brother.<eos> I don't know why I feel that you will not vote for me in these elections.
I too was young at one point, just like Amit is.<eos> I too fell in love with that guy Mahatre's wife.<eos> But I couldn't act since I didn't have any support to back me up.<eos> My father worked at the mills, we were poor.<eos> But Amit has support.<eos> My support.<eos> I mean, Amit can do what I couldn't.<eos> The police is in my pocket, so they bailed Amit out.<eos> Mr. Bhatnagar, I am terribly sorry.<eos> You were newlyweds.

They came again, sir.<eos> They did it again with my Su.. - What!<eos> What nonsense!<eos> - Don't worry, Inspector Nalavde.<eos> I will not make the mistake of filing a complaint again.<eos> Besides.. I have no hopes from you, neither does Su.<eos> I was here to tell you that had your system helped us a little bit I wouldn't have to do anything.<eos> But now, I will have to..<eos> For my Su.<eos> - You'll have to do something, is it? What will you do?

You just don't seem to care.<eos> You do all the misdeeds, while I pay the price.<eos> But that stops now.<eos> Now, you must stop going around with such friends.<eos> Pay attention to the campaign.<eos> We have the election in two months.<eos> If I hear about another issue involving you I will send you to Pune to sister, do you get it?<eos> Yes. I get it.<eos> See you.<eos> Do you think, he'll listen to you?
Rohan.<eos> I hate to hear these people.<eos> Why are you listening to them?<eos> These voices made our lives silent.<eos> But very soon these voices will be silenced for good.<eos> Hello.<eos> - Do something about Wasim right now.<eos> He's with Amit all the time.<eos> Tell me, sir. What do I have to do?<eos> Well.. You arrest people for a couple of days.. During festivals..
Come on!<eos> We'll have fun.<eos> You're a dead man.<eos> I'll kill you.<eos> So what if you're my friend's son? I'll kill you.<eos> This advertisement should reach every house by tomorrow. Yes, sir.<eos> - Each and every house.<eos> Brother's name should be on everyone's minds. Understand? - Yes.<eos> Mr. Shakeel?<eos> Why did you slap me?
Don't scream.<eos> Don't scream!<eos> Look, your son enjoys on Amit's money anyway.<eos> Now, your daughter has started wooing him too.<eos> Shelar!<eos> - Quiet! Don't scream.<eos> Don't scream.<eos> Now, go.<eos> Go right now behind the mosque, and see it yourself. Then you'll believe me.<eos> You'll know who called whom.
You're trying to woo my daughter!<eos> Drop the knife, Shakeel!<eos> Drop the knife!<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> How dare you file an FIR!<eos> Is he dead?<eos> Mr. Shelar, Mr. Chaubey is senior to me.<eos> So what?<eos> You're always the first one to ask for money.
I'll bear the expenses of your father's treatment.<eos> Withdraw the FIR.<eos> Understand?<eos> Yes.<eos> Hello.<eos> - Wasim, Amit speaking.<eos> You're calling from Mumbai, right?<eos> The number is local.<eos> Your brother was saying that you're in Pune.<eos> Are you both trying to fool me?
Who was she to you?<eos> Everything.<eos> She was all I ever had.<eos> How did you talk in Amit's voice?<eos> You were the one on the phone, weren't you?<eos> I'm blind, but I can hear.<eos> I can talk too.<eos> That's enough! The lights are on!<eos> You're done!<eos> 'You may not be able to see him, but he does exist.'

The lights are on!<eos> You're done!<eos> 'You may not be able to see him, but he does exist.'<eos> 'There's a reason why a person commits suicide.'<eos> Sir, is this a new game?<eos> Are you crazy?
Why would be murder him and leave his handkerchief behind for you to suspect him?<eos> But currently, the circumstances and proofs are against your brother, Shelar.<eos> And if my investigation reaches your brother then I won't step back. - Did I ask you to step back?<eos> Don't forget that I'm guarding my brother.<eos> I'm Madhavrao Shelar.<eos> Go.<eos> Everything begins with the kind and merciful Lord.<eos> All of you pray for the deceased's soul.<eos> Who is it?<eos> Are you crying?

Come, Mr. Chaubey.<eos> Would you like something to eat?<eos> What do you do for a living?<eos> - I'm self-employed, sir.<eos> I know some dubbing work. So, I manage.<eos> Where were you last night?<eos> At home, sir.<eos> Loud noises wake people up, and silence doesn't let me sleep.<eos> Still, I'm trying, sir.<eos> Is there a witness that can say that you were at home last night?
Then why did your wife commit suicide?<eos> Sir, what are you here to investigate?<eos> Wasim's murder, or my wife's suicide?<eos> An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind, Mr. Bhatnagar.<eos> Perfect world, sir!<eos> If everyone's blind, the police won't be needed.<eos> Sir, have you ever arrested a blind man under charges of rape or murder?<eos> Perfect world, sir.<eos> Everyone will be blind.<eos> By placing Amit's handkerchief on Wasim's shoulder you tried to mislead the police.
- It'll burn, sir.<eos> My dish, sir.<eos> Please let go of my hand.<eos> It'll burn.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> It wouldn't be right to use third degree on a blind man.<eos> But if need be, I won't step back.<eos> Next time, we'll meet not in your kitchen but in our interrogation room.<eos> Remember that.<eos> Only if you find evidence against me, sir.

It's me, Nalawde.<eos> - Yes, tell me.<eos> Are you in Pune? - Yes.<eos> Where else would I be?<eos> Your handkerchief was found on Wasim's body.<eos> Are you all crazy!<eos> I didn't kill Wasim.<eos> I know that..<eos> And I know who killed him.<eos> You're next. - Tell me who it is.
Your handkerchief was found on Wasim's body.<eos> Are you all crazy!<eos> I didn't kill Wasim.<eos> I know that..<eos> And I know who killed him.<eos> You're next. - Tell me who it is.<eos> He'll be next.<eos> - Not on the phone.<eos> Come here and meet me.<eos> I hope you know where you have to come.
The body is charred, sir.<eos> Someone burnt him.<eos> Shakeel burnt him.<eos> Shakeel is still in the ICU.<eos> Hey! Whatever it may be, find out.<eos> Or else, just like my brother the entire city will burn.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I'm sure it's Rohan, sir.<eos> I think we should arrest him.<eos> Are you crazy?
Yes, sir. Of course, don't worry..<eos> So, your voice has all the secrets.<eos> I kept wondering why Wasim went to that theatre to meet Amit.<eos> It was their drinking place but Amit was in Pune.<eos> How did he come to Mumbai from Pune?<eos> He was safer in Pune.<eos> Who called him?<eos> And how did he agree?<eos> Whose voice did you imitate to call him?<eos> You're very talented, Rohan Bhatnagar.

How many officers do we have right now?<eos> Four, sir.<eos> - Bring all of them to the gate of Gurukripa Colony.<eos> - We have to keep an eye on someone. Yes, sir.<eos> - Right now.<eos> I'm giving you 24 hours.<eos> But you won't be out of our sight for even a second.<eos> Mr. Chaubey. Can you answer a question of mine?<eos> Truthfully.<eos> If you were in my place what would you have done with Wasim and Amit?

I'll hand him over to you in the morning.<eos> Not in the morning!<eos> Right now!<eos> If I tell you right now, you will not believe me.<eos> I'll bring him tomorrow morning with witness and evidence.<eos> You see, I'll take the promotion from the government and money from you.<eos> Cheers.<eos> I'd have killed those two.<eos> Amit and Wasim.<eos> You asked me a question.

Who are you?<eos> - The guy who called your brother to the warehouse.<eos> Tell me your name if you have the guts.<eos> Rohan.<eos> Rohan Bhatnagar.<eos> You stay there..<eos> I'll kill you in your house.<eos> It's futile going there. The police are fielding it.<eos> Where are you? Tell me!<eos> You'll come, won't you?

This is the place Supriya and I wanted to make our home.<eos> But you didn't let that happen.<eos> Hey, Bhatnagar!<eos> I've had enough of this!<eos> If you wanted to hide, why did you call me?<eos> Come out.<eos> Sir.<eos> Anna, get him.<eos> Anna!<eos> You're next.
This is a murder. But it will look like suicide.<eos> Amit killed Wasim, and Shelar killed Amit.<eos> In the guilt of killing his brother Shelar committed suicide.<eos> Wow!<eos> That was an intelligent plan, Rohan Bhatnagar.<eos> But every criminal leaves some evidence behind.<eos> You left behind a witness.<eos> Just one more hour.<eos> Don't move from here.<eos> Do you remember the fourth option, sir?

The dick that barfed the beer on our car.<eos> I wish that were true!<eos> My mum took Bethie to the movies.<eos> One night.<eos> One... night. Free from the hell of fourth grade math and I get ditched.<eos> Sure, why not?<eos> Thanks for asking.<eos> I'm Marteen McGuire.<eos> Friends call me Teena.<eos> Now you say your name.
Hey, man. Two more.<eos> My mum wants us to move in with her.<eos> Marteen! Lung cancer, the cigarette!<eos> Marteen! A ten-year old needs stability.<eos> Yeah, we would save money, but... I don't know, we're doing OK.<eos> Pretty stable.<eos> Jesus! living with my mother? Could be worse.<eos> Hey, yikes!<eos> I gotta go pick her up.<eos> You know, you could, erm...

DNA, fingerprints...<eos> The only thing they didn't leave were name tags.<eos> [WATCH YOUR FEET]<eos> [SHE'LL BE FINE]<eos> [WE NEED HER DAUGHTER IN HERE]<eos> I'll help her.<eos> [SHE'S LOST A LOT OF BLOOD]<eos> [WE GOTTA GIVE HER AN MRI]<eos> No, no, no, Ma'am, stay down, stay down!<eos> Ma'am, you have to stay down.
Well, that's the thing, Ma'am. She got a good look at those guys.<eos> She's 12... she's 12 years old.<eos> Her mum can't talk, she's our only witness.<eos> It's OK, baby, that's all right, sweetheart.<eos> Can you please wait?<eos> I need your help.<eos> Go! NFPD!<eos> Get down! Don't move!<eos> Get down!<eos> You can't come in here like...
They didn't do it.<eos> For those that truly love him, God promises to make things right and good.<eos> If we do our job, He keeps thy great promise.<eos> As a good Christian parents, what is your part?<eos> Yes, Irma, we are all His children, but until he calls us, we live in this world.<eos> Sometimes He sends an angel, sometimes... a messenger.<eos> Your part... is hiring the best criminal lawyer you can find.<eos> Who's gonna pay that bill?<eos> God?<eos> You hear that?
We're paying twice because it's two sons, right?<eos> Two clients.<eos> But they're charged with the same crime.<eos> So one story.<eos> Jesus, Walt!<eos> Wait, it's like... a woman has two babies.<eos> They ain't twice as much work, she does the same thing for both, that's why she's got two tits, right?<eos> Can you believe this...?<eos> It's OK.<eos> Well now, Walt, wouldn't you have made a damned fine attorney?

So that they don't get raped. Like that innocent woman.
That's OK.<eos> My mum likes a lot of bacon so, you should go talk to Jack.<eos> Not talk.<eos> Ignore him.<eos> Watch and learn.<eos> All those lies about my brothers... Bitch better watch her mouth.<eos> You and your whore mamma better shut your faces.<eos> You hear me?<eos> This is just about summoning them to trial.<eos> All you have to do is identify them.

Jesus Christ!<eos> You're right.
Are you hungry?<eos> I made some soup.... tomato.<eos> with bacon and that, like Daddy used to do.<eos> Let's go heat it up.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Teena.<eos> Friday morning is the first step, in a series of steps to make sure that men like that, never do this to anyone ever again.<eos> I'll see you in Court.<eos> [INDISTINCTIVE]<eos> You point them out, I'll put them away.
This gruesome attack was intended to lead to the death of Mrs McGuire, as she was left, in a boat house, to bleed to death.<eos> In fact, if Mrs McGuire's daughter had not been present, Marteen McGuire would not be alive today, to give her testimony.<eos> Mrs McGuire suffered serious physical injuries, she's been in intensive care and she's still recuperating from the attack today.<eos> Your Honor, Marteen McGuire's presence in this Courtroom today is something of a miracle.<eos> Your Honor, I had no idea that the People intended on trying this case today.<eos> But... if it pleases the Court, we're ready.<eos> Well, then I'll just save my opening statement for the trial.<eos> Call your first witness.<eos> The People call detective John Dromoor.<eos> And on the night of July 4th, detective, you responded to a call in Rocky Point Park.
Your Honor,<eos> We're gonna have big problems here if the State refuses to honor the basic principles of discovery.<eos> We have no record of a call.<eos> One moment, you Honor.<eos> Actually, me and my partner were coming from another call, when we observed...<eos> Actually, detective, it's my partner and I...<eos> And actually, there's no question pending.<eos> I'd like to rephrase, your Honor.<eos> Thank you, Jesus.<eos> Detective, on the night of July 4th when you and your partner were driving through Rocky Point Park, What did you observe?
And actually, there's no question pending.<eos> I'd like to rephrase, your Honor.<eos> Thank you, Jesus.<eos> Detective, on the night of July 4th when you and your partner were driving through Rocky Point Park, What did you observe?<eos> An injured young female came towards us from outside the boat house.<eos> This young girl here?<eos> Bethel McGuire?<eos> Yes.<eos> And when you entered the boat house, what did you observe?<eos> Detective, you may step down.
- Mrs McGuire?<eos> Prior to your attack, did you know the assailants?<eos> They knew my name.<eos> Objection!<eos> Unresponsive!<eos> - Teena, Teena... - Sustained!<eos> Teena! Please, wait for the next question, Mrs McGuire.<eos> - Yes, I see them.<eos> Your Honor, the defense is happy to stipulate, Mrs McGuire's positive identification of all four defendants.<eos> Thank you, Mrs McGuire, you may step down.
[BAILIFF, CLEAR THE COURTROOM]<eos> Not too bad, huh?<eos> Your mom's gonna be OK.<eos> Gave something to sleep. At least through the night.<eos> Oh, not now, honey.<eos> - Give her some time.<eos> - I just wanna see her.<eos> Bethie, the doctor's right.<eos> We need to let her rest, OK?<eos> You know? You should all get some rest.
We need to let her rest, OK?<eos> You know? You should all get some rest.<eos> Sleep when she sleeps. Thank you.<eos> Oh, God...<eos> How is she doing?<eos> How do you think?<eos> Get out.<eos> Get out!<eos> Mrs Kevecki...<eos> You... promised... to protect Teena.
That's not gonna happen.<eos> The Kirkpatrick strategy is to try to manipulate the jurors and the gallery.<eos> Well, it worked.<eos> Jurors want to vote not guilty. It's the generous Christian thing to do.<eos> Oooh, is that supposed to be encouraging?<eos> I'm ready for that, for Him.<eos> The women are being attacked.<eos> Rape must be punished, I'm not gonna let them get away with this.<eos> Now, I need to see Teena.<eos> I need you to leave.

I need you to leave.<eos> Hey, can I get a beer?<eos> Are you OK?<eos> Sorry!<eos> You have a child.<eos> You have a daughter.<eos> We both know what it's like to lose someone we love.<eos> Don't let her lose her mother too.<eos> Don't let her feel any more pain.<eos> Why do you care?

You gotta keep an eye on her.<eos> You gotta take real good care of her.<eos> I don't think she wants anyone to take care of her.<eos> You give that to your mum, right?<eos> She can call anytime, day or night.<eos> Seven, O, Six... Three, Five, Eight.<eos> Leave us alone!<eos> Miaow.<eos> They were here.<eos> Can you please help us?
You want another Court date?<eos> [WHAT DO YOU NEED?<eos> Another one of these and a shot of Jack.<eos> - That's called a hit, baby.<eos> Oh, that's a bitch!<eos> Stay back!<eos> Police!<eos> John Dromoor, badge 736, requesting an ambulance and a coroner's wagon.<eos> Chippewa and 4th.<eos> And at the time of the shooting, you were entirely unaware that this was James de Lucca.

When he was watching the fight?<eos> I wasn't at the bar.<eos> I was at a table.<eos> So, John, when you fired your weapon, it was purely self-defense, right?<eos> Yes, Sir.<eos> Three years in the service.<eos> Desert Storm.<eos> A Purple Heart.<eos> Rocky Point was your case, detective.<eos> So, you're telling me at the time of the shooting you had no idea about Raymond Casey's connection with Marteen McGuire?
All right, here's the deal.<eos> Lose the rape one and the predatory assaults drop the agg assaults to misdo's and we're done.<eos> Misdemeanor assault?<eos> The Ficks plead on two counts.<eos> For Teena, for the kid.<eos> 18 months each on each count...consecutive.<eos> Three years guaranteed.<eos> Have you seen Teena McGuire?<eos> Have you seen what they did to her?<eos> Have you?

You son of a bitch.<eos> No victim, no witness, that's a hard case to win in any venue.<eos> And this town by next week? The case is dismissed.<eos> What happened to winning this?<eos> A Jury trial. No guarantees.<eos> I had to finish my shift.<eos> He wants to make a deal.<eos> Jail. Three years.<eos> I'm presenting an option.<eos> Do you not hear yourself?
And a good attorney advises you of that risk.<eos> If we lose...<eos> We're not going to lose, that's the whole point!<eos> It's 20 years in State Prison, minimum.<eos> No, no, no, no...<eos> Jail is jail, been there, done that, I ain't going back.<eos> We're on!<eos> I swear to Christ!<eos> Canada!<eos> We'll go to Canada. No, no, no, you won't.

This is a private property, you're trespassing.
Get off my property! This is a private property, you're trespassing.<eos> Get out of here!<eos> You got any relatives in Canada? Friends?<eos> Some place where they might go?<eos> These are my boys, they wouldn't do this. Something happened!<eos> We lost our house. That's what happened.<eos> No, they wouldn't run!<eos> I'm telling you. They wouldn't do this.<eos> Walt get back out here!<eos> Mrs Fick, have you heard from them?

Do you think we will hear from your sons?<eos> All right. You wanna know what happened?
They're gone!<eos> They're outlaws!<eos> They're ... There you have it. Outlaws or fugitives.<eos> [POLICE ARE ON FULL ALERT]<eos> [POLICE BELIEVE THE BROTHERS MAY HAVE CROSSED THE BORDER ON FOOT] [AFTER ABANDONING THEIR VEHICLE] Mamma!<eos> Mum!<eos> [MARVIN AND LLOYD FICK GREW UP IN NIAGARA FALLS]<eos> [AND KNOW THE REGION VERY WELL]<eos> The Ficks... gone.

Are you sure?<eos> I'm ready for... a change.<eos> Me too.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I was gonna say bye to Annie?<eos> I also wanted to make one last stop.<eos> You wanna come with me?<eos> You think I'm the bad guy? Because I defend men that you think are...<eos> Scum.<eos> You know, John? We have a document in this country, it's called the Constitution?
You know, John? We have a document in this country, it's called the Constitution?<eos> And in that document, it expressly provides my services for... all citizens.<eos> Even criminals.<eos> What's not in that document, is vigilante cop justice.<eos> Even for cold-blooded murderers.<eos> Maybe they had it coming.<eos> Maybe they didn't.<eos> Guess we'll never know now.<eos> Who knows?<eos> You might even need my services someday.

Well, not fine but better.<eos> You've been taking good care of her.<eos> You wanna come to the station? No.<eos> Come on around at the gate.<eos> We're leaving.<eos> Tomorrow...<eos> California.<eos> I came to say good-bye, we came to say good-bye.<eos> And thank you.<eos> That day, you brought her home.
- Grazie mille.<eos> - Prego mille.<eos> Thanks a thousand. You're welcome a thousand.<eos> - Oh... - Man, I wouldn't say that. Make you sound like you're stupid.<eos> Please. Yeah, nobody's gonna like this.<eos> Come on. Pino, what do you think?<eos> I like that.<eos> Sounds tough.<eos> - See?<eos> - Mm? You know what Italian word I love?
We are full.<eos> We don't have room.<eos> Uh, well, you can tell that was negative. Um, hold on.<eos> One more idea.<eos> Allora. I have a reservation for one... Dev.<eos> Can we sit together?<eos> It's not a problem for me if it's not a problem for you.<eos> But do you even know this woman?<eos> No, we just met.<eos> You're a strange person.

I'll ask.<eos> I have a reservation for one that I made for my birthday.<eos> If you want to join me, you're welcome to.<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> Maybe she doesn't like you.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Come on! It'll be fine.<eos> Let's just eat.<eos> What are you gonna do, just wander around here?<eos> Like, this'll be the same as if you were just eating here anyway, only now both minorities will be sitting at the same table.
Woman: Is green tea all right for you, Hillary? Mm-hmm.<eos> Um, so, when I finally got to New York and I knew that I wanted to support myself on my own so I could write, well, I thought that was gonna mean, you know, serving cheesecake in Junior's or temping in the Bronx.<eos> And it turned out it meant part-time sex work in an oddly clinical townhouse in midtown.<eos> And you know something?

It means silence. It means, you know, a room of one's own.<eos> No, no, no. See, that's bullshit.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> That's what we perceive a male writer to have.<eos> You know?
That's what we perceive a male writer to have.<eos> You know?<eos> And that can lead to, ugh, horrible solipsism and disconnection from humanity. I'm not naming names.<eos> Never naming names.<eos> Martin fucking Amis, Woody Allen, Saul Bellow.<eos> If you give the men the space that they say they need, then their work suffers, they suffer.<eos> I guess that surprises me because I've always thought that I was working towards this moment when everything else would fall away and I would just be, like, you know, alone and able to just indulge my thoughts.<eos> No, but that's bullshit.<eos> I mean, can you even picture that?<eos> Can you picture that?
Hannah, can you text that one interesting lesbian you know and see if she can get me into the "New York Mag" party tonight?<eos> I don't know, Elijah. My bladder's on fire. I don't know if I feel like abusing my media contacts for you right now.<eos> Jaden Pinkett Smith is starting a greeting card line.<eos> Please!<eos> You're gonna look cool for even knowing about it.<eos> Can I at least have some pain killers?<eos> Oh, I wish you had asked me, like, two hours ago.<eos> Clean out.<eos> Well, will you tickle my back?<eos> You know how they're shutting the N/R down at DeKalb?

And I think it would be good for your health.<eos> Oh, for my health? Okay.<eos> So, I should just bail on my recovery? - Do you think that's a good idea?<eos> - No.<eos> Hey, nice doing business with you.<eos> It's been great.<eos> I mean, I don't wanna play the blame game, but you're my worst enabler.<eos> What you just did right there... and I don't wanna insult you... but that was fucked up what you just did right there.<eos> It's not an insult. Nobody's blaming you.<eos> Desi just feels as if maybe you have helped to support, - even encourage his relapse. - Yeah.

But I think that the idea, Desi, that I have, in some way, caused you to develop an addiction to something is absurd.<eos> - No, that's... no, it's not...<eos> - Oh, my God! - It's not absurd.<eos> - Oh, am I... you're hearing what I'm hearing, right?<eos> - Because...<eos> - It's okay, it's okay.<eos> We're going to let Desi finish, and when he's done, you can then let us know how you feel.
I mean, you just fucking walked away. You gave up.<eos> I shut down?<eos> I gave up?<eos> Do you have any idea how hard this has been for me?<eos> I have bruises all over my body from the two-hour massages that I need to deal with the stress of your addiction.<eos> Are you... are you serious?<eos> - Did you hear what she said, man? - Yeah.<eos> Because you just made my whole drug treatment about you.<eos> You did.<eos> You really did, Marnie.
Well, then I guess I just don't understand the point of the scene.<eos> It's about when Mira goes off her meds.<eos> Yeah, no. I know that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I mean, I don't understand why there's this whole romantic bit where you swoop in and save her and act like you guys are meant to be together when this is a movie about a shit relationship.<eos> The scene is about the fact that these two people, while they have a very strong animalistic connection, they're ultimately only gonna hurt each other.<eos> It's about the tragedy of realizing the relationship is too intense to survive.<eos> Adam, that's us.<eos> We're the intense ones.<eos> All you and Hannah ever did was sit around, watching those shows about when fat people do up their houses or whatever, or you ate Frito-Lays in bed.
That's not helpful.<eos> - Hi! Hi, I'm looking for my mother.<eos> I don't know if you've seen her.<eos> - She's yay tall.<eos> - Yeah! - Kind of spiky hair.<eos> - Rocker chick. Rocker.<eos> Like a Midwestern rocker.<eos> We're really worried about her.<eos> She's pretty stoned and we don't know what's going on.<eos> Loreen! I'm just hoping that you could give us some k...

Rocker.<eos> Like a Midwestern rocker.<eos> We're really worried about her.<eos> She's pretty stoned and we don't know what's going on.<eos> Loreen! I'm just hoping that you could give us some k...<eos> Loreen! Would it be possible to purchase one dumpling?<eos> Thank you very much, Nick.<eos> And if you see my mother, will you tell her that I'm looking for her?
Okay, why?<eos> Because to be perfectly truthful, I think it's a really bad idea.<eos> Okay, well, I understand how it would seem that way...<eos> No, no, no, no. No. It doesn't seem that way.<eos> This is yet another reckless, impulsive, typical Hannah decision like cutting your own hair or cyberbullying that girl you met at Barnes Noble.<eos> We did that together.<eos> That was something we chose to do together for fun.<eos> - So, I guess you're gonna move out now?<eos> - Well, I wasn't planning on it.<eos> Pfft, well, I wasn't planning on sharing an apartment with some... do you mind?
You're not ready for this.<eos> No, you're not ready for this.<eos> I'm gonna say this to your face 'cause no one else will have the guts to.<eos> You're gonna be a terrible mother.<eos> Oh, great, you're gonna cry now?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Mic check. One, two, one, two, one, two.<eos> This is Hermie coming at you from the living room of one Sonja Ballentini.<eos> So, Sonja, how's life?<eos> You know what? It doesn't pay to complain.
Jim?<eos> Y-you there?<eos> Those thunder bumpers have finally left the area.<eos> It is 68 degrees and partly sunny in Bend, with another chance of rain on Saturday.<eos> This is a weather pattern that is looking to really continue over the next couple of days.<eos> Romero.<eos> You've got a visitor.<eos> Hey, Sheriff.<eos> How's life?<eos> Oh, I'm here because you were worried about me.
This is a weather pattern that is looking to really continue over the next couple of days.<eos> Romero.<eos> You've got a visitor.<eos> Hey, Sheriff.<eos> How's life?<eos> Oh, I'm here because you were worried about me.<eos> It was really kind of you to send your friend to see how I'd been getting along.<eos> But as you can see, I'm quite all right.<eos> You are, huh?<eos> You know something?
You've got a visitor.<eos> Hey, Sheriff.<eos> How's life?<eos> Oh, I'm here because you were worried about me.<eos> It was really kind of you to send your friend to see how I'd been getting along.<eos> But as you can see, I'm quite all right.<eos> You are, huh?<eos> You know something?<eos> Don't think I am unsympathetic to your plight.<eos> I know what it's like to be locked up somewhere and being watched all the time, because you put me in such a place... do you remember?
Katie will be short on grandparents, but at least she'll live in a honest, open world...<eos> Especially between us.<eos> I hope so.<eos> Norma, are you home?<eos> Hey, Norma?<eos> Hey, Norma?<eos> - Hey.<eos> Watch it. - Or what, bitch?<eos> Norman?<eos> Yes? If you're Norman, your coffee's sitting here.
Yeah.<eos> I've gotten to know this nice girl, Joanne.<eos> She's helping me with my store Website.<eos> She's single and says she never meets anyone.<eos> She's really cute and nice, and you're really cute and nice.<eos> My husband doesn't know many people here, and I'm trying to get him to see how cool this place is and, you know, meet the locals.<eos> I thought it would be a win-win.<eos> And a chance for us to get to know each other better, too.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Well, I think if you're going, then it's different.
We're gonna have so much to talk about.<eos> Let's... Why don't we say tonight? Say, 7:00 at the Temple Street Bar?<eos> I would love to have dinner with you, meet your friend.<eos> Great.<eos> It's a date.<eos> Great.<eos> Bye. - See you later.<eos> - See you.<eos> Hi.<eos> How do you feel?
Great.<eos> It's a date.<eos> Great.<eos> Bye. - See you later.<eos> - See you.<eos> Hi.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Swell.<eos> Do you know your name?<eos> D-do you know yours?
Hi.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Swell.<eos> Do you know your name?<eos> D-do you know yours?<eos> I know that I don't have a concussion.<eos> Alex Romero, inmate number A49452... cellblock five, cage 63.<eos> I'm serving five years on a trumped-up perjury beef.<eos> What happened?<eos> Did someone find out you're a cop?
Let's go in the basement!<eos> The basement it is!<eos> It's a peregrine.<eos> Fastest-moving creature on record.<eos> Still pretty rare, though.<eos> She's stunning.<eos> So here's what I'm thinking.<eos> I bring you these, uh, specimens...<eos> And you, uh, turn 'em into art. Then I help you sell 'em.<eos> You really think someone will buy them?
Welcome to the Kings Motel.<eos> What brings you to town?<eos> - I'm just visiting my sister.<eos> Uh, which credit card will you be using today?<eos> - Uh, cash.<eos> - Cash is fine.<eos> Who's your sister?<eos> Norma Bates.<eos> What?<eos> Um, when was the last time you talked to her?
I've been out of the country.<eos> Right, um...<eos> Uh, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but your sister... she, uh... she passed away.<eos> It was a terrible tragedy.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> No, she didn't. I was just with her son. He would've said something.<eos> I don't know what to tell you.<eos> Look, she... she died. She committed suicide.<eos> It made the local news.<eos> I'm so sorry you had to hear about it this way.

No. I came to see you.<eos> This double date...<eos> I just came by to see... what kind of a man you are.<eos> I'm not sure we have the same dictionary definition.<eos> I'm not gonna stand here and explain myself to you.<eos> All I can tell you is... stay out of it.<eos> Well, you're right. It's none of my business.<eos> I barely know you or your wife.<eos> But man-to-man,<eos> Sam, you don't care much for her, do you?
We don't talk anymore.<eos> He's a dick.<eos> So, uh, then you decided to go - into computer programming.<eos> - Yeah. I don't really like it, but I'm kind of good at it, so...<eos> You're amazing at it.<eos> Norman, you should see the Website she's making for us.<eos> It's easy with you. You're artistic.<eos> Oh, I know she is, just from being in her shop.<eos> Uh... our shop.<eos> Mm. Yes, of course, Sam. It's just, you're never there.
- What are you doing?<eos> - I'm going out.<eos> - No, Mother.<eos> You can't.<eos> Bourbon, neat.<eos> How's your night going?<eos> Oh, it's going.<eos> I'm just sick of my job.<eos> I hear you.<eos> What do you do?
You can't.<eos> Bourbon, neat.<eos> How's your night going?<eos> Oh, it's going.<eos> I'm just sick of my job.<eos> I hear you.<eos> What do you do?<eos> I'm a caretaker for a mentally ill person.<eos> Wow. That's a tough gig.<eos> Yeah, you're not kidding.
I'm like, "What the hell am I doing this for?"<eos> "Personal satisfaction?"<eos> I spend a lot of time alone or getting him out of problems he creates...<eos> By not listening to me, you know?<eos> And... and... I just don't like having to do these things.<eos> It's getting to me.<eos> I need to get out more, see real people.<eos> I'm gonna have to start cutting my hours.<eos> I admire that you do that work.<eos> I'm sure it means a lot to the guy you're taking care of, even if he can't articulate it.
- I told her... he was gonna snap someday.<eos> She didn't listen to me.<eos> Maybe you don't know Norman the way that you think you do.<eos> He's not getting away with it, no.<eos> Norman!<eos> Shit!<eos> You're not getting away!<eos> I know what you did!<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Well, now you know, Chick.
Evening, gents.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Hello, there.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Well, it is now.<eos> What can I do for you, mister?<eos> If I could trouble you for a moment of your time.<eos> You a doctor?
Hello, there.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Well, it is now.<eos> What can I do for you, mister?<eos> If I could trouble you for a moment of your time.<eos> You a doctor?<eos> I am.<eos> And do you like it?<eos> Has its moments.<eos> Do you like what you do?

It is the only path to utopia.<eos> You have too much time on your hands, Wells.<eos> Perhaps you should think about dating again.<eos> You can't stay divorced forever.<eos> That's what I've been telling him.<eos> I consider myself single, not divorced, if you must brand me.<eos> And, yes, I can stay single forever.<eos> I find it far more desirable than the suffocating effects of marriage.<eos> You see, that is precisely what love is supposed to do... Suffocate.<eos> If you read a poem now and then instead of science books, you'd know that.

May I take your coat?<eos> Thank you.<eos> John!<eos> You're here.<eos> I had you almost written off.<eos> A doctor's hours are not his own, I'm afraid.<eos> Good evening, gents.<eos> John!<eos> Right. Now that we're all here, let's get on with it.<eos> By now you all know my obsession with time travel.
You could say I'm in the research phase.<eos> And how does one research time travel?<eos> He constructs a time machine and travels through time.<eos> So, your book is nonfiction.<eos> So, where is this time machine?<eos> See here.<eos> Please.<eos> All right.<eos> Good lord, Wells!<eos> You actually built the bloody thing.
So, your book is nonfiction.<eos> So, where is this time machine?<eos> See here.<eos> Please.<eos> All right.<eos> Good lord, Wells!<eos> You actually built the bloody thing.<eos> How much have you spent on it?<eos> How is this thing supposed to work?<eos> You set the time and date with the dials on the board.
Please.<eos> All right.<eos> Good lord, Wells!<eos> You actually built the bloody thing.<eos> How much have you spent on it?<eos> How is this thing supposed to work?<eos> You set the time and date with the dials on the board.<eos> The solar cylinders yield enough energy to compress the machine into subatomic particles, resulting in the thermodynamic suspension of molecular activity, which allows it to journey across the fourth dimension from one time sphere to the other.<eos> I'm genuinely concerned for your sanity.<eos> You've taken this too far.

Imagine who you could be if you didn't live in fear.<eos> Or more importantly, imagine the stories you could write if your life were full of adventure.<eos> You might finally get that novel published.<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Wells?<eos> Scotland Yard is at the door.<eos> What is going on?<eos> The Ripper has struck.<eos> A woman was found in an alley near here.<eos> We're conducting a housetohouse search.<eos> Absolutely. WhWhatever you need.
I can no longer make social and cultural assumptions.<eos> My apologies.<eos> May I keep this?<eos> Okay, so, really, who are you? It's apparent, isn't it?<eos> It's some publicity stunt...<eos> Yeah. What is it, some stage play about H.G. Wells in the Village somewhere?<eos> Is it opening night tonight?<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> How did you get past the sensors and inside the actual exhibit?<eos> I'm certain you won't believe the answer to that question.

Wells.

So, a few tourists posted pics on Twitter on Instagram, but so far, no news outlets have picked it up.<eos> Great.<eos> Mr. Wells, this is where we say goodbye.<eos> Please, the other man?<eos> He hasn't broken character once.<eos> It's pretty amazing.<eos> Please, I must find him.<eos> No one here is a amused by your fake accent and costume.<eos> If I catch you within spitting distance of this museum, you will prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.<eos> Do you understand?

He really does look like him.<eos> Please, the gentleman who was here earlier...<eos> What time? - About an hour ago.<eos> - Did he say anything?<eos> - Where he might be going? - Said he wanted to explore the city, see the sights, asked about a hotel, so I sent him to the Renaissance in Times Square.<eos> Renaissance in Times Square.<eos> Brilliant.<eos> Where is that?<eos> Out these doors, turn right, walk uptown 50 blocks.<eos> You can't miss it.
Renaissance in Times Square.<eos> Brilliant.<eos> Where is that?<eos> Out these doors, turn right, walk uptown 50 blocks.<eos> You can't miss it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And may I remark how happy I am to see that race relations have improved since 1893.<eos> I knew that one day, the color of a man's skin would dissipate and we would all live side by side as brothers.<eos> Yeah, we're all one big happy family.<eos> What are you, in "Les Mis"?
I have money, but that's all, I'm afraid.<eos> Let me speak to my supervisor.<eos> We can usually work something out.<eos> Did you lose your luggage, too?<eos> You...<eos> You saw him? Where is he?<eos> He wanted to do some shopping, so we sent him over to 5th Avenue.<eos> 5th Avenue?<eos> Right, and where is that?<eos> You'll never find him.
We chose not to involve the police.<eos> It was a minor incident, and the last thing we wanted was to call attention to it.<eos> Did you get their information?<eos> Where can we find them?<eos> I don't have that.<eos> I realize how this looks.<eos> But in my defense, most infractions are harmless.<eos> And it's not our policy to arrest guests at the museum.<eos> As owner of this exhibit, I find that answer unacceptable.<eos> You need to find these men, Ms. Walker, or I'll see to it that Anders Enterprises files charges against you and the museum.

Right in front of my cab.<eos> Step away, sir.<eos> Ambulance is on the way.<eos> Don't move.<eos> How ya doin'?<eos> How's your head?<eos> It hurts.<eos> Um, may I ask, where am I?<eos> Manhattan General.<eos> You're lucky you just suffered a slight concussion is all.

Thank you.<eos> Please level with me.<eos> I'm in a lot of trouble.<eos> The time machine exhibit is my responsibility, and I don't wanna lose my job.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Very well.<eos> My name is Sigmund...<eos> Don't say "Freud."<eos> Kemp.<eos> And you were correct.
Who are you?<eos> Very well.<eos> My name is Sigmund...<eos> Don't say "Freud."<eos> Kemp.<eos> And you were correct.<eos> I... I am an actor.<eos> And I am playing H.G. Wells in a small production about his life.<eos> I am sorry about what happened at the museum earlier.<eos> So, you're an actor, you're from London, and this is all just a big prank?

No.<eos> We're good.<eos> Well, thanks for blowing up my day.<eos> It's been most stressful and inconvenient, but I hope you feel better.
No, the second one... cute one.<eos> Okay, I'm going home.<eos> Call me if something explodes.<eos> Can you just wait here one second?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Just a little lightheaded is all.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Did the hospital release you?<eos> I really must find my friend.<eos> I really think you should rest.
Yes.<eos> Yes, he was struck by a motor vehicle in Times Square.<eos> No, this is the third hospital I've called.<eos> Yes, I'll hold.<eos> Easy.<eos> This is lovely!<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, do you live alone?<eos> Maybe.<eos> No, you're perfectly safe with me, Ms. Walker, I promise.

Um, this is from last night.<eos> What about you?<eos> I'm divorced.<eos> Do men and women even fancy marriage today?<eos> You mean in America?<eos> Yes, we fancy marriage, particularly my mother.<eos> She wants grandkids yesterday, but she doesn't understand that the benchmark for that stuff has changed.<eos> I'm still in my first career.<eos> I can have kids when I'm 50.<eos> So, you prefer being single.

A man said that to you?<eos> Well, what he said exactly was that I was<eos> "curiously unspecial and intriguingly mediocre."<eos> That's appalling!<eos> He was a wannabe songwriter who talked in bad lyrics.<eos> Any man who says that to a lady is no gentleman.<eos> Which is why I quit Tinder.<eos> But, I mean, it does have some truth to it.<eos> I moved to New York to have this crazy, exciting life.<eos> And that hasn't materialized yet, so, yeah, you could say my life is pretty unspecial at the moment.

Thank you.<eos> Is the music always this loud?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You wanna dance?<eos> I can think of a few things I'd like to do.<eos> I found some clothes from my ex.<eos> It ended quickly, and he never came back for his stuff.<eos> You can shower and freshen up in here.
I always end up with the wrong guy.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Because I don't trust anyone, ever.<eos> And then I realize I don't trust anyone, so I try to.<eos> And then, I end up trusting the wrong one.<eos> It never fails.<eos> Are all women today as selfaware as you?<eos> No, I'm the only one.<eos> They gave me an award and everything.<eos> I find you fascinating, Ms. Walker.

Sleep tight.<eos> In international news...<eos> I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm so sorry. I didn't...<eos> Want some coffee?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> What are your plans for today?<eos> I must find my friend.<eos> The museum's closed, so I have the day off if you need any help.

Utopia is a reference to me.<eos> The keys in her mouth...<eos> That's a message to me.<eos> He wants the key... this key.<eos> Jack the Ripper lived over 100 years ago.<eos> I lied. I'm not an actor.<eos> Just, please, look at this key.<eos> Surely as a museum curator, you can see that this is a relic.<eos> That doesn't prove anything.<eos> You asked me how I was able to get into the machine.
I lied. I'm not an actor.<eos> Just, please, look at this key.<eos> Surely as a museum curator, you can see that this is a relic.<eos> That doesn't prove anything.<eos> You asked me how I was able to get into the machine.<eos> Yes!<eos> Because it was in my basement in 12 Mornington Lane in London, where I live.<eos> In 1893?<eos> Yes.<eos> You seem so sane in so many ways.

If I don't stop him, he will keep killing.<eos> If you know who killed that woman, then you need to go to the police!<eos> They won't believe me.<eos> You don't. Jane.<eos> What if I can prove to you that I'm telling the truth?<eos> Then we can both go to the police together.<eos> Grant me access to the time machine.<eos> I'll prove it to you.<eos> Watch your step.<eos> You know, I could get in a lot of trouble for this.
But it is three days later.<eos> This exhibit doesn't open for three days.<eos> That would be today.<eos> How is this possible?<eos> I'll give you a moment to process.<eos> Is this really happening?<eos> Are you really H.G. Wells?<eos> Flesh and blood.<eos> I must seem so different to you, so inappropriate.<eos> You're from Victorian England.
I must seem so different to you, so inappropriate.<eos> You're from Victorian England.<eos> I ate with my hands.<eos> What is it like to be here in this time?<eos> I'm dazzled, astonished.<eos> I'm also profoundly disappointed.<eos> I envisioned a society that was entirely different.<eos> Yeah, II think we all did.<eos> It's not without its beauty, though.<eos> I must take issue with something that you said earlier.

Yes.<eos> I'm just breathing.<eos> So, you haven't written "The Time Machine" yet.<eos> Started it, several times.<eos> I haven't quite figured it out yet.<eos> What about the others?<eos> "The Island of Dr. Moreau,."<eos> "The Invisible Man," "The War of the Worlds"?<eos> I write for the London Gazette.<eos> Trust me, you write a lot of books.
I write for the London Gazette.<eos> Trust me, you write a lot of books.<eos> It's nice to know I'm inspired.<eos> I can't believe this is real.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> - So, I die three days from now.<eos> - I will fix this, I promise.<eos> How? We can't go to the police.<eos> They'll never believe us.<eos> The paper said that you were the third victim.
- It's 10:30.<eos> I'll go to the club, and I'll stop him.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Google.<eos> Internet search.<eos> This is her.<eos> She's 23.<eos> She's pretty.<eos> Haven't much time.<eos> You'll need a gun.
Google.<eos> Internet search.<eos> This is her.<eos> She's 23.<eos> She's pretty.<eos> Haven't much time.<eos> You'll need a gun.<eos> There will be no violence!<eos> The man who raises his fist first is the man out of ideas.<eos> Yeah, that's all very nice, but you need a gun.
Over here!<eos> Help!<eos> Please! Somebody help us!<eos> I want that key.<eos> Up here!<eos> This way!<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah. Are you okay?<eos> My God.<eos> You need stitches.
Up here!<eos> This way!<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah. Are you okay?<eos> My God.<eos> You need stitches.<eos> Please, let me take you to the hospital.<eos> No, I'm... I'm fine.<eos> This could get infected.<eos> You need antibiotics.
My God.<eos> You need stitches.<eos> Please, let me take you to the hospital.<eos> No, I'm... I'm fine.<eos> This could get infected.<eos> You need antibiotics.<eos> Don't be stupid.<eos> It's too late for that, I'm afraid.<eos> Stupidity's become my dominant trait.<eos> I think you did pretty well tonight.

Hello, Mr. Wells.<eos> Who are you?<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> We have a lot to talk about.<eos> No, I have to find Jane.<eos> She was just here.<eos> John took her.<eos> You mean the Ripper took her.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because you told me.
We have a lot to talk about.<eos> No, I have to find Jane.<eos> She was just here.<eos> John took her.<eos> You mean the Ripper took her.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because you told me.<eos> I'll explain everything, but we need to go now.<eos> II don't know you!<eos> But you will.
I'll explain everything, but we need to go now.<eos> II don't know you!<eos> But you will.<eos> I'm Vanessa.<eos> I'm your greatgreatgranddaughter.<eos> How can I possibly be related to you?<eos> I've never met you before in my life.<eos> But I've met you in my life.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> So is time travel, but here you are.
I have to find John.<eos> He will kill her.<eos> He would have done that already.<eos> He wants something.<eos> What is it, Mr. Wells?<eos> Is it the key?<eos> How do you know about the key?<eos> Please.<eos> They're gone.<eos> Come with me and I will help you find them.
Is it the key?<eos> How do you know about the key?<eos> Please.<eos> They're gone.<eos> Come with me and I will help you find them.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Stop.<eos> - Get off me.<eos> Get off me!<eos> You can't do this.
- Stop.<eos> - Get off me.<eos> Get off me!<eos> You can't do this.<eos> - Get back here.<eos> - Wait, stop it.<eos> Stop. He will kill her.<eos> I must find Jane.<eos> Vanessa will be right with you.<eos> You said you would help me find Jane.
Stop. He will kill her.<eos> I must find Jane.<eos> Vanessa will be right with you.<eos> You said you would help me find Jane.<eos> How? You've been hurt.<eos> You should sit down.<eos> No, no, I'm fine. Jane is all I care about right now.<eos> Please, let me look at that.<eos> We are wasting time.<eos> You can't do anything if you bleed to death.

You feisty little bugger.<eos> Right.<eos> What is your telephone number?<eos> Why?<eos> Because I need to have a little chat with your new beau.<eos> I don't...<eos> Herbert George Wells, remember him?<eos> He has something that I want, and I have something that he wants.<eos> I need your telephone number.<eos> How do you know he has my phone?
I don't...<eos> Herbert George Wells, remember him?<eos> He has something that I want, and I have something that he wants.<eos> I need your telephone number.<eos> How do you know he has my phone?<eos> Well, he's naive and pathetic.<eos> He's not stupid.<eos> Your number.<eos> I'm not gonna help you.<eos> Thought that's what you might say.

Julia Milton.<eos> Her friends call her Jules.<eos> 28, single, from Richmond, Virginia, currently working as a fashion consultant with Macy's where she makes a staggering $165,000 a year.<eos> Isn't that mad?<eos> Did you know this apartment costs $8,000 a month?<eos> I mean, thththe economics of this period are just absurd.<eos> Now, I really, really think it's time you made that call, don't you?<eos> Blocked caller.<eos> This could be him.<eos> Now, you need to talk to him, but don't mention us.

Stop, he's gonna wake up.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Okay, okay, come on past.<eos> Please don't wake up.<eos> The stairs will be faster.<eos> Come here!<eos> I wouldn't do that.<eos> Walk out that door, and she's dead.<eos> Please.<eos> Are you sure you want to know?

- Doug?<eos> - Right this way.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Who's that?<eos> You didn't get my message?<eos> When did you send the message?<eos> I texted you this morning.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> Not everyone knows you're H.G. Wells.
It's really not a big deal.<eos> Thank you, Senator.<eos> Not yet.<eos> You've been granted a reprieve due to the feisty little vixen in the next room.<eos> Now, now, don't get too cozy.<eos> Well, it is... That is soft, isn't it?<eos> It's like a cloud.<eos> They really have figured some of these things out, haven't they?<eos> Let her go.<eos> You don't need her.

Prestigious surgeon, in fact.<eos> So why do you kill?<eos> Do you like playing God?<eos> Deciding who lives and who dies?<eos> You're a bold one with your questions.<eos> Why prostitutes?<eos> Do you have something against women or just sex?<eos> Be careful with your tongue.<eos> I do not allow women to speak to me this way.<eos> Well, when you get in that time machine, make sure you go backwards.

It is my theory... every time we travel to the past or future, you prick the fabric of time.<eos> If you go too close to any one time repeatedly... It can cause a hole in time.<eos> What happens then?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> We melt, implode, cease to exist.<eos> I prefer not to find out.<eos> But that is why time travel is dangerous.<eos> In the wrong hands, it could, quite frankly, destroy the world.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> We're better off with you meeting him in the park at noon.

The murders were misogynistic in nature, "suggesting a hatred for women."<eos> No.<eos> That is simply inaccurate.<eos> I mean, I killed prostitutes because of the opportunity.<eos> They troll alleyways.<eos> They make it easy.<eos> I also killed vagrants and street urchins in equal measure.<eos> It says here I was never identified.<eos> I don't even get credit for it?<eos> Did I not mention you're famous for being an anonymous killer?

I'm a decorated surgeon, highly regarded all over London.<eos> No, you're Jack the Ripper, a faceless dark cloud on humanity.

That slakes my thirst.<eos> You're gonna go right through that entrance, follow the path, you can't miss the bridge.

I had this under control.<eos> Hey, stop!<eos> - Kids!<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Move.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Let's get out of here.<eos> You weren't supposed to be here.<eos> And now she's dead.<eos> You've killed her.
- Let's get out of here.<eos> You weren't supposed to be here.<eos> And now she's dead.<eos> You've killed her.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> I thought it was the right call.<eos> I couldn't let you go alone.<eos> We should have something soon on the phone trace.<eos> You sealed her fate.

Because he's a madman, and we've angered him.<eos> He could lose all reasoning.<eos> We will find her.<eos> No, you don't understand.<eos> When I arrived, I was helpless, lost.<eos> She was the one person who showed me kindness.<eos> He will kill her just to get back at me.<eos> I know him.<eos> I'm done here.<eos> If you'll excuse me.
Are you serious?<eos> - Oof.<eos> - I am so sorry. - Eyes up, dude.<eos> My apologies, sir.<eos> Please forgive me.<eos> I'll just...<eos> - What the hell, man? - I am so sorry.<eos> Do you know which way downtown is?<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Are you following me?
I want out of this bloody time.<eos> Then go.<eos> Just leave, disappear.<eos> To hell with it.<eos> I don't need the key.<eos> The time machine still works.<eos> I can go anywhere I bloody want.<eos> I'll disappear into another time.<eos> No.<eos> You don't have to kill her!

The museum will be closing in 10 minutes.<eos> Please proceed to the exits.<eos> The museum will be closing in 10 minutes.<eos> Please proceed to the exits.<eos> Hey, Jane.<eos> The exhibit's closed.<eos> Yeah, I have, an endofday report for Vanessa Anders.<eos> I won't be long.<eos> Hurry up before they figure me out.<eos> Just go wherever you're going.

John, you're making a huge mistake.<eos> John!<eos> Come on.<eos> Can you stop him?<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Come on, you.<eos> - You all right?
It's your phone.<eos> Hello?<eos> I'm gonna make this short and sweet.<eos> I'm going to kill one person every day until I get the time machine with the key.<eos> Do I make myself clear?<eos> Was that him?<eos> He still wants the key.<eos> How are you, Miss Walker?<eos> I've been better.<eos> You've been through quite an ordeal.

And a part of me has always been waiting... hoping.<eos> I'm just happy you're here.<eos> Get some rest.<eos> It's been a long day.<eos> Thank you, Vanessa, for your kindness.<eos> Good night.<eos> Hello again.<eos> It's Griffin.<eos> Yes, Griffin.<eos> And you're George...
And you're George...<eos> Wells.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Have you seen Vanessa?<eos> She's in her office.<eos> Care for a drink?<eos> It's... it's late.<eos> Perhaps another time, though.<eos> Sure.<eos> Sorry, Vanessa mentioned that you're a descendant of the real H.G. Wells.
How so?<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> A direct descendant?<eos> Um, was he your greatgreatgrandfather, a distant cousin?<eos> It's a complicated lineage.<eos> Um, how long are you staying?<eos> I'm not sure exactly.<eos> Is there a problem? No. No, no.<eos> Just... making conversation.<eos> If there's anything you need while you're in the city, just let me know.
That's very kind.<eos> All right, it's late.<eos> - I'll be off.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Have a good night, George.<eos> You too.<eos> May I?<eos> Come in.<eos> This place is insane.<eos> Are you sure it's okay that I stay here?
I think it's a good idea, at least until we find John.<eos> It's safe here.<eos> Vanessa has some very large men guarding her.<eos> Vanessa's one of the richest women in the world.<eos> She might be even wealthier than Oprah.<eos> What is an Oprah?<eos> Never mind.<eos> How does she know you?<eos> It's okay.<eos> You can sit.
She might be even wealthier than Oprah.<eos> What is an Oprah?<eos> Never mind.<eos> How does she know you?<eos> It's okay.<eos> You can sit.<eos> Well... it appears that Vanessa and I are related.<eos> Apparently, I visited her years ago, and I gave her this.<eos> It's how she knew to find me.<eos> You traveled to the past and gave this to her?
It's how she knew to find me.<eos> You traveled to the past and gave this to her?<eos> Well, actually, her past, my future, it's...<eos> That's how she knew she would see me again.<eos> Okay, that makes my head spin.<eos> Mine, too.<eos> What does this emblem mean?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's something from my future, I assume.<eos> Why didn't you write more in this letter?
Okay, that makes my head spin.<eos> Mine, too.<eos> What does this emblem mean?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's something from my future, I assume.<eos> Why didn't you write more in this letter?<eos> Trust me, I've been racking my brain.<eos> Clearly, I needed to convince myself to trust Vanessa, but there is a danger to knowing your future.<eos> You would be tempted to alter it.<eos> Maybe the future you was scared you might do that.

So, what has you so glum tonight?<eos> Do you believe people have the power to change?<eos> Truly change who they are?<eos> Wow. So heady with your whiskey.<eos> Well, yes, I think people canchange.<eos> They have the ability, but I don't think they do, not really.<eos> People hate change.<eos> It's too hard.<eos> Yes. It does seem overwhelming.<eos> What do you say we, take this somewhere a little quieter and have ourselves a proper drink?
But painted like this, it looks bigger, right, Merche?<eos> That's true, it does.<eos> - You see I painted the gray you liked?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's turned out really well.<eos> - It's kind of rustic.<eos> - Industrial style.<eos> Does it need a coat of something?<eos> - Maybe a varnish? - Yeah, but...<eos> You've just seen each other!
- Dad, don't say anything.<eos> - I won't.<eos> - Hello. - Hello.<eos> It's the friend!<eos> I'm the father-in-law.<eos> - I mean, the father.<eos> - Don't listen to him.<eos> - I'll take those.<eos> - No, they're not for you.<eos> - Are you Merche?
If they were for the mother-in-law, what do you have for my daughter?<eos> - Dad!<eos> - Thinking about the dowry?<eos> Well, life's tough these days.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - How far along are you?<eos> - I'm due in three months. Thanks.<eos> - Do you mind if I touch it?<eos> - No, go ahead.<eos> Are you two thinking about it?
- Less than 60 miles away.<eos> - Right.<eos> - More wine?<eos> - Yes, please.<eos> - Can you camp there?<eos> - They look the other way.<eos> I don't know why we're talking about it.<eos> Carlos, you should help me.<eos> School is more difficult now.<eos> You can't meet up during the week and then talk on the phone until all hours.
What?<eos> I did a pregnancy test.<eos> - Are you pregnant? - No.<eos> She didn't want an abortion.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Well, tell us something kinky.<eos> Yeah, filthy.<eos> Have you never done anything very...?<eos> In the village, don't you screw cows and things for fun?
Well, tell us something kinky.<eos> Yeah, filthy.<eos> Have you never done anything very...?<eos> In the village, don't you screw cows and things for fun?<eos> Sure, since we don't have TV or the Internet we have to do something.<eos> You have to tell us something real.<eos> Come on, tell us something.<eos> Come on, tell us.<eos> Something heavy.<eos> I did something you couldn't imagine.
- Was it true?<eos> - I don't doubt it. It's fraud.<eos> First, he makes an inter-community acquisition in which there is a tax on consumer spending that is also deducted.<eos> When the merchandise enters the interior market, it has the output tax which gives the buyer the right to deduct it, but then he pays it...<eos> Babe, are you okay?<eos> Why haven't you texted?<eos> Carlos, this is Merche.<eos> - This is no time to call.<eos> - I have to speak to Laura.<eos> You can speak tomorrow.
Carlos, this is Merche.<eos> - This is no time to call.<eos> - I have to speak to Laura.<eos> You can speak tomorrow.<eos> Please, don't call again at this time.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> You forgive me.<eos> If you'd been pregnant, we would have had it, I swear.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> If you don't want an apprentice, remove the sign.
I don't trust him.<eos> Look, I take them from my brother.<eos> He gets them for after his chemotherapy.<eos> They leave you feeling like new.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - You want to make out?<eos> - Or do you want a pill?<eos> 20. - No, thanks.<eos> Fuck, what are you doing?
Three of us have to piss.<eos> What a pain.<eos> You're making a mess of that.<eos> Let me do it.<eos> I told Alex that Susana fancies him and wants to screw him.<eos> She'll kill you.<eos> I had to do something about them.<eos> They're both useless.<eos> - You're crazy.<eos> - What are you doing?
- Someone from Amsterdam.<eos> What was the music?<eos> Techno.<eos> - Do you like techno?<eos> - Not much.<eos> It's not your style.<eos> Do you mind sitting in the back?<eos> - What was it like? - Pretty good.<eos> It's cool.<eos> - Where have you been?
- Not much.<eos> It's not your style.<eos> Do you mind sitting in the back?<eos> - What was it like? - Pretty good.<eos> It's cool.<eos> - Where have you been?<eos> - It's near La Central.<eos> - It's a cool place, it was packed.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> How come you left so early?
Call me afterwards.<eos> - No, Carlos.<eos> - Please, promise me.<eos> - Call me when you come back.<eos> - Okay.<eos> FRIDAY, APRIL 29<eos> You're fired.<eos> - What?<eos> - You're fired.<eos> You gave me the morning off.
- What are you doing?<eos> - Waiting for Laura.<eos> I thought she was with you.<eos> No, she's with another guy.<eos> I understand.<eos> I want to go away with her for a few days.<eos> - You love her very much, don't you? - Yes.<eos> I think we just need some time.<eos> - If we're alone, we can sort it out.<eos> - What you need is to give each other space.

[keys clacking]<eos> The action's good.<eos> The ribbon is dry.<eos> Do you know where I could get this thing inked?<eos> Uh, I... I don't know.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Don't know.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm a writer.<eos> You want something to write with, I got laptops.
- Check the name. This is my bag.<eos> What the hell is your problem, miss? I don't care what you're saying, this is my bag.<eos> - No, this is mine, all right?<eos> - Just let go of the bag.<eos> No, I'm not gonna let go! - Give me my bag back. - Cali!<eos> - What are they doing?<eos> - Get down!<eos> Okay, listen up, I'm a cop.<eos> No one move, all right?<eos> Everyone stay where you are. You got cuffs?
So, starting right now, we control the story.<eos> Write State and Local Law Enforcement, FBI, CIA.<eos> I want everyone on the same sheet of music. This was two delusional maniacs, investigation ongoing.<eos> Okay? You guys know the rest.<eos> You call the National Security Advisor, tell him I'm on my way.<eos> Who are you?<eos> - _ - Okay. Good.<eos> Unlock him, please.<eos> My associate, Becca.<eos> What did you tell the police?
- And now you know.<eos> - And tomorrow? - What about it?<eos> And the next day? And the next day? And...<eos> I don't buy it.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> What she's saying is, she doesn't believe it's possible for you to say nothing forever.<eos> State police are one thing. But the type of people we believe are gonna be coming at you next? I have to agree.<eos> Not sure I buy it either.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> What were you expecting?
Really?<eos> Oh!<eos> Our client has instructed us to tell you that your family will be generously compensated for your sacrifice.<eos> It's... aah... This wasn't the deal!<eos> - The hit was...<eos> - Was what? - It was a good hit.<eos> - How do you figure that?<eos> - We got her, didn't we? - What about him?<eos> No, no. We were told to leave him for...<eos> Didn't she just tell you it'd be impossible for you to say nothing forever?

- Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Asha.<eos> - Right.<eos> Sorry, um...<eos> I-I just wanted to tell you that Cali never stopped talking about you.<eos> - Oh. - Her war hero brother.<eos> She probably made a lot more of that than it actually was.<eos> I doubt that.<eos> You realize what you said in that service there makes you family now.

Daddy, you're sweating like a pig. - Oh.<eos> - Someone's calling you. Oh.<eos> Oh, there is a god after all.<eos> Sorry, sweetheart. It's work.<eos> Bry?<eos> Where are you right now?<eos> I'm at home.<eos> Why? Lianne with you?<eos> Yeah, it's my weekend.<eos> Why? You need to get out of there... both of you. Right now.
- I need your tie.<eos> - What?<eos> - Your tie.<eos> How long do you think you can keep running, Bryan?<eos> A day? Two? A week?<eos> One man against the resources of an entire cartel?<eos> - Interesting.<eos> - What?<eos> They're not shooting.<eos> Hey, hey! Where are you going?

Langley, info only.<eos> Done, done, and almost done.<eos> Okay. Make the call.<eos> This is your one shot to get her back. Do you understand?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Agent Hall. To what do I owe the pleasure?<eos> - They took my daughter.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> You heard.
Yeah.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Agent Hall. To what do I owe the pleasure?<eos> - They took my daughter.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> You heard.<eos> I did everything that was asked of me. Hold on, hold on.<eos> This is not a secure line.<eos> You're gonna call your client and get my daughter back. Right now.<eos> Or I hand myself in and you're in a Rikers jumpsuit by tonight.
- Okay.<eos> - Don't hang up. - Just a couple of more seconds.<eos> - Are you in radio contact?<eos> Strict radio silence. He contacts me first. Why?<eos> There a problem?<eos> Potentially.<eos> That affects his visit?<eos> Will you break radio silence if I say yes?<eos> No, I just wouldn't turn on the lights on the runway.<eos> Is that what you're saying I should do?

Reroute all calls.<eos> You killed my son.

I'm no use to them dead.<eos> - Do it now!<eos> - Let him go!<eos> He killed my son!<eos> For my sister.<eos> Mama, this is Papa. Target secured. Alive and kicking.<eos> Mama Roger. What about Mills?<eos> Over.<eos> Those are ice chips in that blue cup.<eos> You were at my sister's funeral.
Over.<eos> Those are ice chips in that blue cup.<eos> You were at my sister's funeral.<eos> Yes, I was.<eos> Who are you?<eos> The man who shot you works for me.<eos> Where am I?<eos> Buffalo Presbyterian.<eos> Trauma wing.<eos> Do you understand why you were shot?

And now you're gonna tell me none of this ever happened.<eos> My portfolio is an emergency covert action team.<eos> Who shot me?<eos> Who saved your life?<eos> Tell me what you believe in, Bryan.<eos> Because what I see is a man who is wired to protect others.<eos> It's how you're built, it's who you are.<eos> It's why you tackled those gunmen on the train in the first place... to protect those 93 other passengers in that car.<eos> I just did what I did.<eos> But when you failed to protect your own sister...

I'm seeing you after three years. Can't I even hug you?<eos> Let's go. It's a long drive back.<eos> Oh.. You look so tired.<eos> What have you done to your hair?<eos> Style!<eos> Hey, this looks so dirty, why haven't you cleaned it properly?<eos> There is a wedding in the house. Come on, get serious!<eos> Come on, keep this on the ground.<eos> How will he manage alone?<eos> We had asked for four people, but you've got only two.
Let's all go. It'll get covered up.<eos> We have to go and tell them about it.<eos> Tell them what?<eos> You're.. You're joking, right?<eos> It's funny, but it's not a joke.<eos> Aishwarya had got it done.<eos> I had read it in the local newspaper.<eos> Who believes in such superstitions nowadays?<eos> It's up to you.<eos> You had asked for his horoscope.
What difference does it make, dear?<eos> Think of it as a joke.<eos> It's just a small ritual, let's get it over with and move ahead.<eos> Okay, enough of this serious discussion.<eos> Michie, let's go.<eos> Let's have a drink.<eos> Mom, what is this.. - Let's go.<eos> So what can I get you?<eos> "My beloved is here, and the ambience is made."<eos> Technology has advanced so much and you're still listening to these old records?
Yes, I am. Who else will I marry?<eos> So how does it make a difference if we get married now or later?<eos> I can't keep waiting for you to be in the right frame of mind.<eos> That's true.<eos> So you're happy, right?<eos> According to your horoscope if you don't marry a tree first something terrible will happen after your marriage.<eos> Such as, both of you can fall ill. Your careers might get ruined.<eos> But this won't happen now.<eos> After marrying the tree all your problems will be sorted.<eos> And you'll lead a comfortable life.
Let's start the ceremony.<eos> Smile.<eos> Come here, dear.<eos> Come and sit.<eos> Congratulations to all of you.<eos> The ceremony is now complete. - Congratulations.<eos> Congratulations!<eos> Congratulations!<eos> Kanan, selfie!<eos> Bheem Singh, here's the money, you can cut down the tree now.
Go to Kanan's room and..<eos> - No!<eos> No?<eos> I don't want to go to his room.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm scared.<eos> Scared? Who are you scared of?<eos> He..<eos> What.. What can I say, ma'am?<eos> You won't be able to handle the truth.
- I.. I.. I didn't.<eos> - I know, but what did you do before that?<eos> I went to my room and slept?<eos> Idiot, what did you do before that?<eos> I had gone to that tree.<eos> - Tree!<eos> 'After marrying the tree, all your problems' 'will be sorted.<eos> The ceremony is now complete.'<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You're a ghost.
And I can be free only when you die.<eos> It's not like I can do any more dying.<eos> So, for me to get rid of you, I.. I'll have to kill myself?<eos> Stop talking nonsense.<eos> You will die when your time comes.<eos> You could meet with an accident.<eos> Or I.. I could even live for 100 years.<eos> Please don't say that.<eos> I hope you die soon so that I am free of you.<eos> Here I'm the one who is saddled with a ghost. You want to get rid of me?
Apart from me dying? Can't you just go?<eos> Where?<eos> You have cut down the tree.<eos> So.. You..<eos> You..<eos> Were you alive before you died? No, no.<eos> I was born a ghost.<eos> - What?<eos> What! Are you daft?<eos> If you've a home, why don't you go there?
You're right.<eos> Come on, Phillauri, sing!<eos> - Come on, Phillauri, sing!<eos> Phillauri!<eos> Hello, everyone. How are you doing?<eos> Are you ready for some fun?<eos> Let me tell you a story.<eos> It so happened that I got into a spot of trouble for no fault of mine.<eos> You all know everyone sings my praises.<eos> You are well aware what a gentleman I am.
Breaking the dawn with the edge of its beak.<eos> Fattened on sugar drops.<eos> You should be ashamed of yourself.<eos> I'm sure nobody dances like this even in brothels.<eos> If the elders drink like this what will the children learn?<eos> Why can't you leave me alone?<eos> Please.<eos> You know why..<eos> A married woman has to stay in her husband's house as long as she lives.<eos> But aren't you dead already?
'Spring is here.'<eos> 'The gentle breeze..'<eos> Excuse me, just a second.<eos> Do you have that journal, Preetam?<eos> - Of course. One minute.<eos> Here you go.<eos> But the poem is not here.<eos> - Your poem?<eos> Don't you know, it hasn't been published this week?<eos> And last week? You must have the old issues, right?
You will go, won't you?<eos> You are a poet, so intelligent.<eos> I can't believe that you would say such silly things.<eos> Must be Soma.<eos> - At this hour?<eos> - He comes over at odd hours.<eos> Wait, I'll be there!<eos> I'm coming! I'm coming!<eos> Brother!<eos> - Kishanchand! You'll kill her!
What has come over you now?<eos> Please don't scold him, Dolly.<eos> He will tell us if we ask him nicely.<eos> Aren't we doing all this for their happiness?<eos> He's anything but happy.<eos> - Anu, please let him speak.<eos> Kanan, don't be scared.<eos> Tell us what the problem is.<eos> - Let me tell you.<eos> He actually got married to me. And then you got the tree cut down.
Womaniser..<eos> Alcoholic..<eos> It's all true.<eos> I'm all this and more.<eos> I was all this and more.<eos> Before I met Shashi.<eos> How dare you enter my house!<eos> I will kill you!<eos> Don't you dare look at my sister!<eos> You are right. I am not worthy of her.
I was all this and more.<eos> Before I met Shashi.<eos> How dare you enter my house!<eos> I will kill you!<eos> Don't you dare look at my sister!<eos> You are right. I am not worthy of her.<eos> But I can try. And I will be.<eos> I am going to Amritsar.<eos> To record the songs written by Shashi.<eos> You don't know, do you? She is a poetess.
I am going to Amritsar.<eos> To record the songs written by Shashi.<eos> You don't know, do you? She is a poetess.<eos> Nobody knows this.<eos> Everybody in Punjab reads her poems.<eos> But they don't know that she is the poetess.<eos> I will make sure she gets her due.<eos> On Baisakhi I'll ask you for her hand in marriage.<eos> Please take care of Shashi till I return.<eos> After that, I'll take better care of her than you ever could.
Come on, relax. She won't hurt you.<eos> Calm down. Come on. Nothing will happen.<eos> Nothing will happen.<eos> She dresses a little scantily, but the girl is nice.<eos> She likes you.<eos> - What?<eos> - She likes you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - There..<eos> Why are you here?
Don't abandon me, dear heart. I am nothing without you.<eos> Dear heart..<eos> This pain of separation wounds me.<eos> Dear heart..<eos> This pain of separation wounds me.<eos> "It urges me to rebel."<eos> "Dear heart.."<eos> "This pain of separation wounds me.."<eos> How does she know this poem?<eos> Grandma, which song are you singing?
Amritsar, 1919.<eos> Shashi.<eos> Please call the bride and groom.<eos> Anu!<eos> Kanan, where are you going?<eos> Anu!<eos> - Anu!<eos> Anu, where are you going? - Wait!<eos> Wait.. Anu! - Wait..<eos> Where are you going? - Come..
How would you know?<eos> Killed yourself like a fool.<eos> Everybody knows what happened in Amritsar on Baisakhi, in 1919.<eos> What?<eos> "What happens when your past haunts you.."<eos> "You are left with no option" "but to seek solace from God!"<eos> "O' Lord, be auspicious unto me.."<eos> "O' Lord, be auspicious unto me.."<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> I'll never forget what you've done for Shashi and me.
Wearing clothes would be advisable.<eos> Couldn't find a trail, but found this, huh?<eos> Smoking the dope.<eos> Not surprising.<eos> This is a local teen party spot.<eos> Hey, if there's any weed still in that pipe, I'll take it.<eos> Back to the lab for a forensic workup, guys, geez.<eos> Could you all please stop yammering and just get on with it?<eos> I have to wash the blood from Gaston's coat before it sets.<eos> You need to be patient.

Whatever the dogs didn't eat was bruised, scraped or punctured.<eos> The location of the trauma suggests the body was dragged on both anterior and posterior planes.<eos> Dr. Brennan, I've been meaning to ask, would it be okay if I put you down as a reference?<eos> Now that I've finally completed my PhD,<eos> I've applied for a job as lead forensic anthropologist at the NFL.<eos> Whoa, they need forensic anthropologists in pro football?<eos> I think the NFL Daisy's referring to is the National Forensic Lab.<eos> I will be a reference, Dr. Wick, but I advise you not to get your hopes up.<eos> In light of your young age, landing a job of that status would be a long shot at best.<eos> Uh, didn't you get your job here when you were still in your 20s?
I'm s-s-sorry, Dr. Hodgins.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> You Randy Stringer?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> But I didn't call an Uber.<eos> Oh, I'm not Uber.<eos> FBI.<eos> Here to ask you a few questions about last Friday night.<eos> We have evidence that you were in the woods at Greenwood Barrens.
Sorry to ruin your laugh-fest, there, but, yeah.<eos> I constructed a replacement using hair from my own beard.<eos> Really?<eos> Oh, here we go again.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hi.<eos> Listen, I don't have any credit card debt, and I'm-I'm just not interested in buying one of your cruises, so...<eos> Are you sure you're calling for me?
No, that-that...<eos> Can you give me one second?<eos> Uh...<eos> Maybe she is buying a cruise.<eos> I was under the impression that bio-electronic devices were not yet available to the consumer market.<eos> Yeah, as far as I know, they're not, but, I don't know, maybe our victim had a connection to the tech world.<eos> - Um...<eos> - Wow.<eos> You guys are never gonna believe this, but I just won a MacArthur Fellowship.<eos> You know, the one that everyone calls the "genius grant"?
Yeah, I know, um... wow.<eos> They said my work with the Angelatron was "groundbreaking."<eos> Good job, Ange!<eos> See?<eos> I always knew I married a genius.<eos> Well, technically you did not.<eos> Though Angela is incredibly talented.<eos> Thank you?<eos> Dr. B. Angie's your best friend.<eos> You got to at least try to be happy for her.
Yeah, better than most people.<eos> AMI, please tell us what you observe.<eos> Dr. Brennan appears 78% curious and 22% jealous.<eos> Agent Booth is 94% amused and six percent skeptical.<eos> And you, Kate, are 100% nervous.<eos> Oh, well, of course I am.<eos> I'm being questioned by the FBI.<eos> Thank you, AMI.<eos> Your work here is done.<eos> So, um, you and Ian didn't have any bad blood, did you?
Excuse me, sir.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's okay, Alan, they're with the FBI.<eos> Then they should be smart enough to realize that it isn't an injury at all.<eos> It's carpal tunnel.<eos> You know, from sitting at a computer all day.<eos> A compressed median nerve would not cause the knuckles to swell.<eos> I'm a little bit bloated, so what?<eos> Ow!<eos> Whoa! Ow! You are hurting me.
Alan, and the injuries to your metacarpals are an exact match for the bruises on Ian's skull.<eos> Fine.<eos> So I hit him.<eos> That doesn't make me guilty of murder.<eos> Well, I'm not sure I trust the guy that sucker-punched his boss in the back of the head.<eos> I had just worked my third 16-hour day in a row when Ian tried to force me to work through the weekend.<eos> - I was tired.<eos> I lost it.<eos> - Really?<eos> You know what I think?

If one of my employees struck me on the skull, I'd have fired him on the spot.<eos> Please.<eos> Do you know how hard it would be to replace me?<eos> I am far and away the best coder they have.<eos> That's great.<eos> Where were you last Friday night?<eos> Same place I always am-- my desk at Social Cybernetics where I was coding all night long.<eos> Well, our team will have to verify that.<eos> Yeah. Sure. Go right ahead.<eos> But if you want to find the actual killer, you ought to be questioning those nuts from Stop the Robopocalypse.
Well, our team will have to verify that.<eos> Yeah. Sure. Go right ahead.<eos> But if you want to find the actual killer, you ought to be questioning those nuts from Stop the Robopocalypse.<eos> The Roba what?<eos> Robopocalypse.<eos> They are a radical group who believe that A.I. is out to destroy humanity by enslaving the human race.<eos> Yes, and Ian's favorite hobby was going onto their blogs and baiting them into fights.<eos> The same Ian that built these robots that helped these autistic kids?<eos> I know-- that seems out of character.<eos> Not if you knew the guy.
Did he just say "dink"?<eos> I think he did.<eos> Any word from the NFL?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But I can't stop stressing about it.<eos> Even if they do call Dr. Brennan for a reference, what if it backfires?<eos> You know, she does have a tendency to be blunt.<eos> That is one way of putting it.<eos> Do you think it'll seem like a red flag if I call the NFL and I ask them to use you as a reference instead?<eos> I think you should focus on your work and try not to worry so much.
It's like the victim was hit with a bunch of different objects from... multiple angles.<eos> After he was already dead?<eos> Yes and no.<eos> There's also evidence of perimortem blunt force trauma on the frontal bone at the coronal suture.<eos> It must have been obscured by all the postmortem damage.<eos> Huh. I'll have Hodgins swab, see if we can identify the murder weapon.<eos> Oh, and, Daisy... if... the NFL doesn't hire you... you'll always have a job here.<eos> Hey, uh, according to Alan's computer, he was telling the truth.<eos> He was logged in and working until 4:00 a.m. last Friday night.<eos> The guy's a coder-- you don't think he could have faked that?

So all we got are a bunch of dead ends and a creepy talking robot.<eos> What, are you afraid of AMI?

So all we got are a bunch of dead ends and a creepy talking robot.<eos> What, are you afraid of AMI?<eos> You're not?
AMI and her little buddies start getting more advanced, then we stop being the smartest thing on the planet.<eos> Wow, Aubrey, I never knew you were so paranoid.<eos> Hey, you know that anti-A.I. group,<eos> Stop the Robopocalypse?<eos> Why?<eos> Are you thinking of joining?<eos> That's funny.<eos> It turns out their leader crashed one of Ian's speaking engagements last year and struck him in the leg with a baseball bat.<eos> Guy by the name of Matthew Coburn.<eos> I wish you'd told me you were into model trains.
I am not playing with trains, Daisy.<eos> I am making a map.<eos> Since Booth couldn't track the drag marks, I customized an old Jeffersonian display so it can match the particulates found in Ian's injuries to specific locations in the woods.<eos> For example, we got birch sap in the victim's left ulna fracture, and the scrapes on his legs have pollen from these swamp azaleas.<eos> Problem is, there are so many random drag marks, finding a pattern will be next to impossible.<eos> It's like we're looking at chaos theory.<eos> I have to say... it's good to see you back to your old self, Dr. Hodgins.<eos> And I wasn't talking about your eyebrow or your legs.<eos> Thank you, Daisy. I think it just, you know, took me a while to realize that my legs are merely a way for me to carry around what's in here.<eos> And, you know, what's in here.

Trust me, if I've learned anything being in this chair, it's that happiness comes from accepting what you have.<eos> But what if what I have is just one big question mark?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> Look at this thing.<eos> I mean, it's so insane that it's actually kind of brilliant.<eos> Well, our victim was a computer genius.<eos> Chances are his killer was pretty smart, too.<eos> Which means they could have purposefully hauled Ian's body through the woods in order to obscure the other evidence.<eos> You're really not gonna get your own wife a birthday present?
Is this really where the head of Robopocalypse lives, in the middle of this industrial wasteland?<eos> Well, this is where Angela tracked down his, uh, Wi-Fi coordinates, so he's got to be in there.<eos> Am I the only one smelling barbecue here?<eos> Good nose, Aubrey.<eos> Matthew Coburn?<eos> How you doing?<eos> Uh, we'd like to have a word with you.<eos> Come on, Matthew, give it up, will you?<eos> Down!<eos> You're kiddin' me, huh?
Geez.<eos> Get off my partner.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Thanks for showing up, Aubrey.<eos> Anytime.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Just because I blogged about the military smart drone program doesn't make me guilty of treason.<eos> I had no idea those files were classified.<eos> We didn't bring you in here because of your blog, Matthew.<eos> You're under investigation for the murder of Ian Goldberg.

Right.<eos> Now all I have to do is compare all the coders' signatures to the code used to delete AMI's data and see which one's a match.<eos> And... none of them are lining up.<eos> Huh. Okay, there's one more that I can try.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Ian was the one who deleted AMI's memory.<eos> Dr. Brennan, something's puzzling me about this injury on the proximal end of the tibia.<eos> It appears to be a postmortem tubercle fracture.<eos> Let me take a look.<eos> You are correct.
Ian was the one who deleted AMI's memory.<eos> Dr. Brennan, something's puzzling me about this injury on the proximal end of the tibia.<eos> It appears to be a postmortem tubercle fracture.<eos> Let me take a look.<eos> You are correct.<eos> But tubercle fractures are not caused by objects striking the bone.<eos> They are created by forceful impact upon landing.<eos> Maybe the body was thrown into the trunk of a car when it was being transported.<eos> Well, if that were the case, we would have found corresponding injuries.<eos> You're right.
Well, if that were the case, we would have found corresponding injuries.<eos> You're right.<eos> That was stupid of me.<eos> No wonder the NFL hasn't called.<eos> Don't be so hard on yourself, Daisy.<eos> So far, your work here has been perfectly adequate.<eos> Adequate?<eos> Yes. Had I been grading you, I would have given you a solid "B."<eos> But I'm capable of A-plus work.<eos> You've seen it.

I've got it!<eos> Maybe the body was hoisted up into something.<eos> That makes sense, for the tubercle fracture as well as the shoulder dislocation.<eos> A-plus work.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now we just have to figure out what kind of sicko would hang someone after he's already dead.<eos> Dr. Hodgins?<eos> Wow.<eos> Or should I say Peter Pan?<eos> Looks like you made major progress on your map.
Now we just have to figure out what kind of sicko would hang someone after he's already dead.<eos> Dr. Hodgins?<eos> Wow.<eos> Or should I say Peter Pan?<eos> Looks like you made major progress on your map.<eos> Yeah, I wish.<eos> I end up going around in circles. Literally.<eos> Well, the killer certainly didn't make it easy for us.<eos> Yeah, really.<eos> You mind grabbing that there for me, Tinker Bell?

That's a good way of saying it.<eos> Or putting it, not that I would put...<eos> You know...<eos> Hey, perverts.<eos> Want to keep your greasy mitts off my dolls?<eos> Look, I didn't do nothing wrong.<eos> Manufacturing sex dolls is not a crime.<eos> Mr. Esposito, we don't have any problems with your business.<eos> Well, that's not entirely true, but it's...<eos> We're here because you met with Ian Goldberg last Friday.

Ian was murdered.<eos> This warehouse is the last known place he went.<eos> Ian's dead?<eos> I took a look at your old military records.<eos> Well, it turns out that you were dishonorably discharged for...<eos> What'd they call it?<eos> "Excessive use of force."<eos> So, I had anger issues back then.<eos> It's ancient history.<eos> I think that Ian had the A.I. you wanted for your sex dolls, but he wouldn't give it to you, so you decided to convince him using force, you wound up beating him to death.
It's ancient history.<eos> I think that Ian had the A.I. you wanted for your sex dolls, but he wouldn't give it to you, so you decided to convince him using force, you wound up beating him to death.<eos> Now, why the hell would I do that?<eos> Ian and I were going into business together.<eos> We were about to make millions.<eos> What, selling, uh, robotic sex dolls?<eos> Sex bots are the future, my friend.<eos> Right now, I'm selling dolls that look and feel just like real women for six grand a pop.<eos> Now, can you imagine how much Ian and I would've raked in selling dolls that talk like real women, too?<eos> I mean, not real women, but the way you wish women would talk?

I'm good.<eos> We're good.<eos> I still think Kate Dalton had something to do with it.<eos> The woman dedicated herself to making robots for autistic children.<eos> She couldn't have been too happy to learn that Ian was gonna put their A.I. in sex dolls.<eos> Well, maybe so, but, Daisy, I mean, come on, her alibi was rock-solid.<eos> Not to mention the fact that Ian owned a 55% stake in their company, so he didn't need Kate's permission to sell.<eos> Ugh.<eos> What could Ian's killer possibly have accomplished by hauling his body all the way out here?<eos> Dr. Hodgins, I've been thinking about what you said about accepting things in life when they don't go your way.

So, whatever, man.<eos> Ian and I did that sometimes.<eos> Said it helped him think outside the box.<eos> Doesn't mean I killed him.<eos> Well, we found sodium nitrate in the knife wounds in Ian's neck.<eos> Wh... What does that mean?<eos> It's a preservative used in sausages and other smoked meats.<eos> See, man, the package said it was all natural.<eos> Oh, crap.<eos> Oh, look, man, I d... I didn't mean to do that, you know?

Let me get this straight: you killed Ian over a bad present?<eos> Look, I thought I was getting millions.<eos> And at least I deserved to be.<eos> Who do you think came up with the idea to put A.I. into sex dolls?<eos> That was me.<eos> You...<eos> That was pure creative genius.<eos> So when Ian said he made a deal and wanted to go to the woods to celebrate, I assumed I was getting a piece of that action.<eos> All he gave me was a lousy portable Bluetooth speaker, so I hit him in the head with it.<eos> You must have been tripping pretty hard to try to cut off his head with a pocketknife and then hide his body up a tree.

I took two tabs.<eos> I wasn't thinking straight.<eos> But you're gonna have a lot of time to think now, 'cause you're going to prison for a long time.
Hold on a second.<eos> So, you knew Daisy had the job the entire time?<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm the one who recommended her.<eos> And I also nominated Angela for the MacArthur grant.<eos> You did?<eos> Yes.<eos> But you made such a big deal about me not being a genius.<eos> Well, I did do a rather remarkable acting job, didn't I?<eos> Uh, yeah, well, you certainly had me fooled.
Well, I did do a rather remarkable acting job, didn't I?<eos> Uh, yeah, well, you certainly had me fooled.<eos> I tell you, Bones, keeping a secret is not one of your strong suits.<eos> That's one of the many benefits of growing older.<eos> We grow wiser in the process.<eos> I'm really gonna miss you, Dr. Brennan.<eos> Oh...<eos> I'm gonna miss all of you.<eos> Champagne...<eos> You are a highly-skilled scientist, Daisy.

Evan, open one of the barrels.<eos> Be careful.<eos> This place is just like they said it would be on the news.<eos> Check it out.<eos> The lid is ajar.<eos> Dudes... this is totally boss!<eos> Baking soda and acid.<eos> Instant volcano!<eos> What?<eos> What are you two nerds laughing at?
Sulfuric acid is not only hazardous, it is highly corrosive.<eos> It would eat through your flesh in seconds.<eos> That is your opinion.<eos> Uh, no, it's fact.<eos> And the reason why I have almost nothing to work with, except for this gray hair.<eos> So you're saying our victim was an old guy.<eos> Well, judging by the deterioration of the medial carpal joints, I'd say at least 70.<eos> Killing Grandpa, huh?<eos> That's not good press for your company.<eos> You want to put that camera away?
That's not good press for your company.<eos> You want to put that camera away?<eos> You know what I'm thinking?<eos> Maybe our victim here was one of the plaintiffs suing Goodlife Chemical.<eos> Hey, Bones, can you just tell me when the body was dumped in the acid there.<eos> I can't say with any accuracy, but Hodgins would have a better idea.<eos> Oh, unfortunately, he wasn't able to make it.<eos> He had some kind of wheelchair accident.<eos> So, do you have direct access to this site?<eos> I must warn you, if you even insinuate my involvement in this man's death,
Let's go!<eos> Oh!<eos> Oh, the acid is all over me!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> Calm down.<eos> Calm...<eos> Calm down, calm down.<eos> Oh!<eos> You want me to calm down? !
Calm down.<eos> Calm...<eos> Calm down, calm down.<eos> Oh!<eos> You want me to calm down? !<eos> Calm down? !<eos> Are you insane? !<eos> Whoa. Don't you know anything? !<eos> This stuff is pure toxic hell!<eos> Uh, do you want to be decontaminated?

Lucky son of a bitch.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Ha, oh, sorry.<eos> It's just, whenever I've thought of my own death, that is exactly how I've always wanted to go.<eos> Man, this day just keeps getting better and better.<eos> Oh, hey, honey.<eos> I'm almost done.<eos> I just feel badly.<eos> It's not a very flattering portrait, I'm afraid.<eos> The way you've drawn him, he reminds me of Eddie, the Iron Maiden mascot.
The facilities seem well maintained, the residents engaged and active.<eos> Right.<eos> Did you just, uh... Pinch your cute little tuckus? Can you blame me?<eos> No, I cannot.<eos> I like her.<eos> All right, don't encourage her.<eos> Hello.<eos> So sorry about that.<eos> Agnes, hands to yourself.<eos> You must be Agent Booth and Dr. Brennan.

Are you okay?<eos> Given your occupation, I would imagine you'd be accustomed to literally being surrounded by death.<eos> What?<eos> Death is inevitable.<eos> Bones, you don't...<eos> And in his case, relatively imminent.<eos> Stop.<eos> Sorry, she didn't mean that.<eos> She just likes to blurt things out.<eos> You're gonna have a very healthy and happy life in front of you.
At least you got something to work with.<eos> I'm not finding any clothing whatsoever in our carbonaceous viper here.<eos> This is really how you want to die?<eos> Yeah.<eos> My Viking funeral, baby.<eos> I have to admit, it's a pretty amazing experiment these kids did.<eos> Michael Vincent and I are totally recreating this when I get home, only much, much bigger.<eos> Sounds like fun.<eos> You and your Mini-Me playing mad scientist.<eos> Speaking of kids, you got a wedding coming up pretty soon.

Yeah.

You mean the Acid Bath Murderer? Yeah.<eos> One and the same.<eos> So, George found that it took 48 hours to fully dissolve a body to the point where you could actually pour it down the drain<eos> - without clogging the pipes.<eos> - Of course.<eos> When killing someone, it's definitely plumbing that keeps you up at night.<eos> So, based on the victim's height and weight, I was able to extrapolate that he was placed in the barrel somewhere between 18 and 24 hours<eos> - prior to the sugar being added.<eos> - Unfortunately, all I found are some blunt force trauma injuries on the left femur and left ribs, three through five.<eos> As you can see, based on the cross-sectional outline, the shape of the weapon was long and cylindrical.
Baseball bat.<eos> - Nunchucks...<eos> - Guys.<eos> Our victim was an old man in a nursing home.<eos> You might want to think cane.<eos> Cane.<eos> Ah.<eos> Here we are.<eos> This is Mr. Felbeck's suite.<eos> As you can see, we provide very spacious accommodations for all of our residents... uh, excuse me, what exactly is that?

So, they suffer from dementia, Alzheimer's.<eos> When they get confused, there are times when unfounded accusations are made.<eos> Booth, I found something.<eos> She found something.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> Is this where he died?<eos> No, this is where he went to heaven.<eos> My husband is euphemistically referring to sex.<eos> By the sheer quantity...<eos> You're gonna need a new cleaning service.
By the sheer quantity...<eos> You're gonna need a new cleaning service.<eos> So... who was Mr. Felbeck seeing?<eos> By seeing, he means... in-intercourse.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's her, right over there, in blue.<eos> Barbara Baker.<eos> Poor thing.<eos> She's been through so much.<eos> What do you mean?
Excuse me.<eos> Listen, let me just do all the talking.<eos> I don't want you to excite them, or say something that's gonna, like, freak 'em out.<eos> That's fine.<eos> I have no intention of causing this poor woman a myocardial infarction.<eos> Hi, ladies.<eos> Uh, Barbara Baker, can we speak to you for one moment?<eos> Oh, not now.<eos> I'm 84 and I'm playing bridge.<eos> Whatever you need cannot be more important than playing bridge.
Uh, Barbara Baker, can we speak to you for one moment?<eos> Oh, not now.<eos> I'm 84 and I'm playing bridge.<eos> Whatever you need cannot be more important than playing bridge.<eos> It has to do with James Felbeck.<eos> If anyone looks at my hand, I'll know.<eos> Um... no...<eos> Tell me the truth.<eos> Is James okay?<eos> Maybe you'd like to sit down.
Barbara!<eos> Calm down... Oof! Ooh!<eos> Hey!<eos> I said stop it!<eos> Booth, I would say we have our next suspect, except I'm not sure who seems more guilty.<eos> Mr. Tucker or the cane-wielder herself?<eos> Stop it!<eos> That's gonna leave a bruise.<eos> This is unacceptable.<eos> You must arrest him.
Stop it!<eos> That's gonna leave a bruise.<eos> This is unacceptable.<eos> You must arrest him.<eos> He's a murderer.<eos> Do I look like a murderer?<eos> Yes.<eos> Let's just... remain calm, all right?<eos> Look, all I have to do is ask a few questions, that's all.<eos> You want to question us together?
Look, all I have to do is ask a few questions, that's all.<eos> You want to question us together?<eos> Do you have a problem with that?<eos> Well,<eos> Columbo always questions his suspects separately.<eos> That's very true.<eos> I'm... that was... the actor.<eos> Look.<eos> I'm not Columbo.<eos> My husband doesn't believe you're true suspects.

Yeah.<eos> - Because you're so old.<eos> - Stop.<eos> Thanks, Bones.<eos> Really?<eos> I didn't...<eos> Barbara, let me ask you a question, please, do... why do you think, uh, Rufus here is involved?<eos> 'Cause he's jealous.<eos> Jealous of your relationship with Mr. Felbeck?<eos> You two previously dated?
You mean about what Dr. Hodgins and I were discussing earlier.<eos> Look, I want nothing more than to marry you, and I know how much you want to be a father.<eos> Cam, can we talk about this later?<eos> Not really.<eos> Biologically speaking, our options begin to shrink in the not so distant future.<eos> I hear you, but when I look at you, all I see are limitless possibilities.<eos> That is the most beautiful thing I've ever awkwardly interrupted.<eos> Dr. Hodgins, what is it you need?<eos> Well, Limitless Possibilities here sent me a text.<eos> You've got some vertebraes you need me to swab?
Doesn't sound too promising.<eos> Actually, it means his bones were as strong<eos> - as a 30-year-old's.<eos> - And given the severity of the damage we're seeing, I don't think there's any chance one of the fellow residents could have done this to him.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me, are you Red Hudmore?<eos> I'm FBI,<eos> Special Agent Seeley Booth; this here is my partner<eos> Dr. Temperance Brennan.<eos> You're here because of the guy that was killed, right?
Uh, did you know him?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> No.<eos> What about Rufus Tucker?<eos> He said he saw you in the TV room the night before last.<eos> Yeah, I was there till, uh... uh, 10:00.<eos> He kept flipping the TV channels and talking about his all-time favorite television babes.<eos> A gentleman... would never talk that way about Donna Reed.<eos> Wait a second...<eos> You were with the 720 MP Battalion?

My pops, my grandfather, he served with them back in the '50s.<eos> Soldiers of the Gauntlet.<eos> That's what they called us.<eos> That's right.<eos> Soldiers of the Gauntlet.<eos> Right, well, Booth, now that we've verified the alibi, we should get going.<eos> It was an honor to meet you, sir.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, Bones, hold-- one more thing.<eos> You know, I may need another set of eyes and ears on the property while I'm gone, in case you see anything.

This is the common area, where we do our dog therapy, among other activities.<eos> Who had access to the room last night?<eos> All the staff and residents have full access 24/7.<eos> This is Sam, one of our orderlies.<eos> He'll clear the area so you won't be disturbed.<eos> I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask the two of you to leave.<eos> This is officially a crime scene now.<eos> Of course.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sam, if you will.
What is it?<eos> We got to go find the orderly, come on.<eos> Excuse me, Sam?<eos> Sam Wadkins?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We need to ask you a few questions.<eos> Booth?<eos> Yeah?<eos> There's blood on these supplies.<eos> Mr. Wadkins, will you take a seat, please?
We need to ask you a few questions.<eos> Booth?<eos> Yeah?<eos> There's blood on these supplies.<eos> Mr. Wadkins, will you take a seat, please?<eos> I prefer to stand.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> It'll be okay.<eos> So, our lab found Mr. Felbeck's blood on one of the solvents in your cart.<eos> If you want any leniency, I'd suggest now would be a great time to confess.

Yeah?<eos> When you're six-six, 300 pounds, accidents can get pretty messy, can't they?<eos> I didn't kill Mr. Felbeck.<eos> He and I were friends.<eos> We used to watch movies together, boxing matches.<eos> He used to tell me about his time as a welterweight.<eos> He was one of the coolest old dudes I ever met.<eos> Okay, then, so, as his friend, then tell me, if not you, who else could have killed him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> So you didn't see or hear anything?
This is very, very demented.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ready... Ooh... ah! 321 psi.<eos> That's a...<eos> That's a good, strong blow.<eos> Yeah, it felt really, really good.<eos> The problem is the ribs are barely fractured.<eos> Which means the killer is someone significantly stronger than Hodgins.<eos> Or our victim's bones weren't as robust as they were six months ago.<eos> I see you're, uh... you're taking some of our computers out for evidence.

Come on.<eos> Come on, it's good exercise.<eos> We can go scope out some suspects.<eos> Well, I...<eos> Come on, let's go for a walk.<eos> Oh, ah, heck.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let me give you a hand.<eos> Let me give you a hand.<eos> You get that.
All right, all right...<eos> Red!<eos> Red, Red, you okay?<eos> Don't move.<eos> Hey, we need some help in here.<eos> Red, Red, don't move.<eos> Quick, call an ambulance!<eos> What happened?<eos> We were just going for a walk, and he fell.<eos> You were exerting him, weren't you?
And someone has been using it to sell prescription medication online.<eos> Was it the victim?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But whoever they are, they've been running some pretty questionable searches.<eos> I mean, anyone who looks up naked pictures of Donna Reed...<eos> that's just wrong.<eos> What, did I say something?<eos> Booth, I know who you need to bring in for questioning.<eos> Mr. Tucker, we did some digging on the computers at the retirement home.<eos> We know that you were selling James Felbeck's drug medication online.

Okay.<eos> So you want to know what I think happened?<eos> Might as well.<eos> I'm paying for it.<eos> I think you stole his medication to sell online, replaced it with some kind of placebo.
So you want to know what I think happened?<eos> Might as well.<eos> I'm paying for it.<eos> I think you stole his medication to sell online, replaced it with some kind of placebo.<eos> Felbeck found out and he confronted you.<eos> I see.<eos> Uh, I take back what I said about the excellent detective work.<eos> Okay.<eos> Fine.<eos> Why don't you tell me what happened?
Fine.<eos> Why don't you tell me what happened?<eos> Well, James came to me, said he needed money, asked me to sell his medication.<eos> Why you? Hmm?<eos> You two close?<eos> No.<eos> Barely knew each other.<eos> But he knew...<eos> I was street.<eos> You're street?
His bones were turning to dust without it.<eos> He told me he was overmedicated.<eos> Well, if he did, then he lied.<eos> All right, let's just pretend for a second that I believe you.<eos> He tell you why he needed that money?<eos> No. He said it was urgent.<eos> That's all I know.<eos> Promise.<eos> Thank you so much for coming in.<eos> And since you knew Mr. Felbeck the best, we thought we could ask you some more questions.

When?<eos> That's a lifetime ago.<eos> He told me he started boxing in his early 20s.<eos> Before the war.<eos> Wait, he said that he served in the military?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> What is it, Bones?<eos> I need to get back to the lab.<eos> Thank you, Ms. Baker.<eos> You have been very, very helpful.

There are some sacrifices that a man just should not have to make.<eos> Yeah, tell me about it.<eos> So, what was the bigger lie? Get this, okay?<eos> The roommate in Richmond, Virginia?<eos> His name was Rufus Tucker.<eos> Oh, funny, Rufus didn't mention that.<eos> That's right, bring him back in now, okay?<eos> Two detectives.<eos> Even more of my tax dollars at work.<eos> You lied to us.
You lied to us.<eos> Uh, no.<eos> I...<eos> I may have made some omissions.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> You're-you're right.<eos> I lied. Yeah.<eos> We know about you and the victim, how the two of you used to live together.<eos> We also know that you were accused of running a scam at your previous retirement home.<eos> So, why don't you go ahead and tell us the truth about why you were selling his prescription medication?

Torsion spiral fracture.<eos> I've already documented it.<eos> Likely caused by some type of rotational force.<eos> I concur.<eos> Now take a look at the anterior planes of the left hamate and capitate.<eos> It's faint because of the acid degradation.<eos> But there are clearly microfractures.<eos> These suggest the victim was holding something that reverberated in his hand.<eos> I need to talk to Angela.<eos> Okay, let me get this straight, you want me to have our victim hit the killer with his cane and then compute the fractures to the victim's own body?
Have you met anyone with a head injury?<eos> No.<eos> But the downward strike could've hit other parts of the body.<eos> Angela, run a new reenactment, this time hitting the clavicle.<eos> I think I know who did it.<eos> Hey, Red.<eos> Hey, Booth.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Look, Red, I know what happened.<eos> I'm not sure what you mean.
Yeah.<eos> It was an impact fracture, they said.<eos> From me impacting the ground.<eos> Look, I was there, Red.<eos> I saw what happened, you landed on your right side.<eos> All right?<eos> The fracture came when Felbeck hit you with his cane.<eos> You want to tell me what happened?<eos> It was when he started talking about the war.<eos> You caught him in one of his lies.
Do you hear me?<eos> We lost.<eos> We lost.<eos> They won.<eos> It's over.<eos> Make the damn call!<eos> Yes. I have senator Grant for the Governor.<eos> "Congratulations..."<eos> Congratulations, Governor.<eos> You ran a great campaign.
For everything.<eos> Really.<eos> What's going on?<eos> My God! Folks, this is just...<eos> My God...<eos> Frankie Vargas has been shot.<eos> The President-elect has been shot.<eos> Does the President have plans to address the nation?<eos> Yes, when we have more information.<eos> Tell me you have the shooter.
My team opened it already.<eos> Nice of the National Security Director to show up on a matter of national security.<eos> I was being briefed by my guys.<eos> We ran a vacuum over the entire event, sucked up the data from everyone's phones.<eos> Mcclintock didn't make or receive a call, text, or e-mail the entire time he was in our zone.<eos> So we're working under the assumption he acted alone.<eos> - It would seem so, sir, yes.<eos> - Good.<eos> I want hourly updates, and I want to know... sir.<eos> You need to get to the hospital.

Only essential personnel.<eos> No campaign staff, no press, no family, no local police, no florists, no orderlies, no administrators.<eos> I want to see only doctors and nurses, Agents, me, and you.<eos> That's it.<eos> I want everyone else off this floor.<eos> And let's toss a net on all cell service, wifi, land lines and cable.<eos> No communications in or out.<eos> We are an island until I say otherwise.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Ma'am, I'm sure you have some security clearance.
So with all due...<eos> Excuse me?<eos> No? - "No" to what?<eos> - No.<eos> I don't have some security clearance.<eos> I have all of it.<eos> No, this isn't a high-level operation.<eos> It's the high-level operation.<eos> No, this isn't your team, it's mine.<eos> No, you are not in charge.

Very sad. I voted for him.<eos> He was smart... And genuine... And he would've been the first Latino President.<eos> That would've been pretty great.<eos> Look, Frankie Vargas is smart and is genuine and is still alive.<eos> Let's not bury him yet, okay?<eos> Will he be giving an update on President-elect Vargas' condition?<eos> Not at this time.<eos> Can you give us an update now?<eos> The President-elect is being treated by a team of the best doctors and surgeons on the East Coast.<eos> As soon as they have an update, you will, too.
- Right now.<eos> Right now, we're in the twilight zone, Mr. President.<eos> If Governor Vargas dies tonight,<eos> Cyrus Beene could be the next President of the United States.<eos> Or it could be Mellie or Jake or me or the marine standing in the hall out there.<eos> The fact is, it could be almost anyone who meets the basic qualifications to be President, because, legally...<eos> And there are very few limits on what the electoral college can do and very little precedent to indicate what it might do in a situation like this...<eos> Legally, the next Presidency is wide open.<eos> But practically,<eos> I think it makes an enormous difference what you do.

Look at her...<eos> An amazing predator.<eos> Can you believe this is for a private collector?<eos> Was it you?<eos> Admit it, Olivia.<eos> This is a gift.<eos> Now you can make a case.<eos> If Frankie dies, Mellie has a legitimate shot to the oval.<eos> But be careful.<eos> You have to play it just right.
I need to call my children.<eos> Their father's dead.<eos> I have to tell them their father's dead.<eos> I understand that, and I'm sorry for your loss, but that can't happen.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> ! Who's in charge here?<eos> !<eos> I am. Now, I'm sorry, but...<eos> Look at me.<eos> You used to be a person, I assume.
! Who's in charge here?<eos> !<eos> I am. Now, I'm sorry, but...<eos> Look at me.<eos> You used to be a person, I assume.<eos> My babies saw their daddy get shot on TV.<eos> They're terrified, and now their worst nightmare has come true.<eos> I have to call them.<eos> I have to be with them!<eos> You need to announce his death, sir, as soon as possible.
Who do I point the American people to?<eos> Mellie?<eos> She lost.<eos> If I throw my weight behind her, it'll look like I'm stealing the election.<eos> I can't.<eos> So I go with Cyrus.<eos> The only problem is, the country didn't vote for Cyrus.<eos> The country voted for Frankie, the man dead on the slab.<eos> How do either of those choices make any kind of sense?<eos> They don't, sir, but you have to do something.

I'm just saying... Caribbean awaits, Robin.<eos> We got to get a move on.<eos> Look, you think you can get in, huck, to the tip line?<eos> Easy.<eos> 832 tips right here.<eos> - 800?<eos> - Look, enough, Charlie.<eos> You want to be done with this case?<eos> This is our only option.<eos> Chef said you didn't eat dinner.
I don't know.<eos> If you don't want it... Now's the time to say so.<eos> No one will know but me.<eos> You can just walk away.<eos> That's nice.<eos> I want it.<eos> The crown, the rare air...<eos> I do want it.<eos> It's been nearly seven hours now since President-elect Frankie Vargas - was shot in Fairmount Park...<eos> - You'll see behind me that a massive candlelight vigil is under way, the number of people growing by the minute...
- But the clock is about to run out.<eos> - You mean give up? - Do not give up!<eos> - He said until morning.<eos> Cyrus Beene murdered Frankie Vargas!<eos> He did this to make himself President!<eos> This was his plan from the very beginning.<eos> And while we're here doing nothing, he is in that Pennsylvania hospital room, launching a full-scale Presidential campaign!<eos> Huddling with advisors, reaching out to delegates, practicing his speeches!<eos> He murdered his way into the White House, and we are doing nothing to stop him!<eos> You may be okay with that.

I'm here to see Cyrus Beene.<eos> - Sorry, but no one is allowed through.<eos> - I understand that,<eos> - but it's urgent.<eos> - Ma'am, you're gonna need to step back.
I'm biased.<eos> You're the only one who can answer that question now.<eos> I don't want to fix another election.<eos> Then you know what you have to do.<eos> Frankie Vargas was a good man.<eos> Honorable.<eos> His family's loss is the country's loss.<eos> And yours.<eos> I appreciate that, Mr. President.<eos> I need you to promise me something.

- I didn't kill that man, Michael.<eos> - The evidence says you did.<eos> - I was set up.<eos> - Swear to me.<eos> I swear to you, Michael.<eos> Put down your weapon!<eos> I find it incumbent that you see the inside of a prison cell, Mr. Scofield.
When do we get started?<eos> - I need your help.<eos> - You're asking me to break the law.<eos> I'm asking you to make a mistake.<eos> Forget to lock up.<eos> Come on.<eos> We did it, Mike.<eos> However this plays out...<eos> I have no regrets.<eos> Well, if you're watching this, that means you're safe.
I wish I could be there with you, but as you know now, I wouldn't have had much time.<eos> I made my choice.<eos> I don't regret it.<eos> We're free now.<eos> We're free.<eos> _<eos> Freedom has a price.<eos> I died seven years ago.<eos> Left behind a brother... a wife... a son.<eos> But the dead talk... if you listen.
Freedom has a price.<eos> I died seven years ago.<eos> Left behind a brother... a wife... a son.<eos> But the dead talk... if you listen.<eos> They're there with you... reaching out... trying to tell you something.<eos> Because not all deaths are the same.<eos> Some are real.<eos> Some are a story.<eos> Question is... do you believe the story?<eos> Was the man who died who you thought he was?

Something you wouldn't tolerate.<eos> But I got good in me, Michael.<eos> I got good in me.<eos> It'd just be nice if you were here to... help me find it.<eos> So... yeah.<eos> "Ogygia."<eos> Telling me where you are.<eos> There's only one way to find out.<eos> Theodore Bagwell.<eos> And you're Dr. Whitcombe, the man who invited me to this mystery meeting at 9:30 at night when the rest of the building's closed.

I know nothing about an envelope.<eos> I can only tell you my work.<eos> Targeted muscle reinnervation.<eos> Using the brain to manipulate prosthesis as it were a natural limb.<eos> But as with any cutting-edge work, funding is not easy to find, and yet, incredibly, I got the grant in the form of a considerable anonymous grant on one condition...<eos> The first recipient of my procedure... is you.<eos> I can equip you with a fully articulate prosthetic, operationally indistinguishable from a real hand.<eos> All of this because of an anonymous donor?<eos> Someone seems to have plans for both of us.<eos> I've reserved an operational lab for Monday if you decide you are interested.

Always.<eos> You saying he faked his own death?<eos> I'm saying you need to look at all of the possibilities before you walk into a war zone.<eos> I wasn't sure you'd come.<eos> Sometimes a man has to surrender to fate.<eos> See what it has in store for him.<eos> We'll need to put you under.<eos> No, no, no. I don't do general anesthetic, compadre.<eos> It's mandatory for a procedure like this.<eos> You'll forgive me if I have a problem lying unconscious before a man with sharp items at his disposal.

Uh, this way, gentlemen.<eos> Follow me.<eos> _<eos> Yemen very dangerous.<eos> You never know who's enemies, who's friends.<eos> Everyone scratching each other's backs.<eos> ISIL is starting to attack the city.<eos> They have been building up out in the desert for months.<eos> If they... take the city, they will kill all the secularists, install Sharia law.<eos> Huh. You know.

Greetings from the U.S. prison system, bitches.<eos> What is it?<eos> Someone set us up.<eos> Come quickly.<eos> Or we'll all be dead!<eos> Go, go.<eos> She's one of us.<eos> Come on, grab your bag.<eos> Come on, let's go!<eos> How did you find us?

This is very radicalized neighborhood.<eos> Whoever set you up couldn't have set you up in a worse way.<eos> Throw your phones out the window.<eos> I don't want anyone tracking us.<eos> Do it!<eos> Sheba, this is Lincoln.<eos> Lincoln...<eos> Sheba.<eos> You've been made whole, Mr. Bagwell.<eos> You're free to go.

There's just one thing.<eos> Arranging such a visit is hard.<eos> Very difficult.<eos> - Comes at a price.<eos> - Money's not a problem.<eos> Not money.<eos> Your passport.<eos> My passport?<eos> What, did...<eos> - you want to hold it?
- you want to hold it?<eos> - No. Straight trade.<eos> Visit for your passport.<eos> Uh, U.S. passport is like gold here.<eos> A few changes, and it can be a ticket to freedom.<eos> Don't do it, Linc.<eos> I know it is not ideal, but... ideals as of right now are history in Yemen.<eos> You cannot get out of the country without a passport.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> Inshallah... you will see your brother soon.
An image.<eos> Right? The one that they sent to you?<eos> - Oh, yeah, yeah. - Do you have it?<eos> Look.<eos> There.<eos> Kaniel Outis.<eos> Yes, Kaniel Outis.<eos> Is he here?<eos> He says, yes, the man in the picture is here and we can see him, but only 'cause we're dealing with Sheba.<eos> Why did you say that name?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. - Do you have it?<eos> Look.<eos> There.<eos> Kaniel Outis.<eos> Yes, Kaniel Outis.<eos> Is he here?<eos> He says, yes, the man in the picture is here and we can see him, but only 'cause we're dealing with Sheba.<eos> Why did you say that name?<eos> Because of my brother's jacket.<eos> Thought you were on the right side of God on this.
He was beautiful and frightening and mysterious.<eos> And he would show up in your life out of the clear blue sky and then he would disappear just as quickly.<eos> But storms, they can come back.<eos> Can't they?<eos> Question is, if they come back, is it the same storm, or has something changed?<eos> New tats.<eos> What do you mean, new?<eos> We're gonna get you out of here.<eos> My name isn't Michael.<eos> And I don't know who you are.
- I'm here.<eos> Whatever you decide to do.<eos> I never wanna spend another day without you ever, for the rest of my life.<eos> Can I kiss you, just one last time?<eos> Just to say goodbye.<eos> Ali, you're really vulnerable right now.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Nothing has changed, has it, Em?<eos> Nicole Gordon, one of the 15 missing American aid workers has been found alive.<eos> Do you really think we'd let you leave?

Jenna is wandering around in the dark.<eos> This can't be real.<eos> Noel's dead, but somebody else is out there.<eos> Out there and just as crazy.<eos> You think Jenna and Noel were working for somebody else?<eos> Or Jenna and Noel had a twisted scheme all their own and we mistakenly assumed that they were A.D.<eos> Sara said we were all looking for the same thing.<eos> - What's inside?<eos> - We were waiting for you.<eos> Golly, you didn't have to do that.
We turn this in to the police, it'll blow up before you can get it in the car.<eos> - He wants us to play him.<eos> - No, Em.<eos> He wants to play with us.<eos> Endgame.<eos> It means that there's only a few pieces left to play.<eos> Then it's all over.<eos> What do we do?<eos> Right now, we don't do anything.<eos> Speaking of someone who's been through an engagement you two are gonna be fine.
That would be Ezra.<eos> - No kidding.<eos> - No kidding.<eos> And they say high school romances don't last.<eos> You deserve personal attention.<eos> Come on, I will give you the nickel tour myself.<eos> Mrs. Horowitz.<eos> You're on the faculty now, Emily, you can call me May.<eos> I'll try.<eos> May, I noticed you've Paige McCullers and Alison DiLaurentis in the same committee.
Just go away.<eos> That's what you want me to do?<eos> God, Ali why do we have to keep showing you that we love you?<eos> I keep getting mail addressed to Elliott Rollins.<eos> Letters, packages.<eos> That's what he left me with.<eos> Sports wear catalogues and a baby.<eos> My life is a steaming hot mess.<eos> Everyone's life is a hot mess.<eos> Em, you and Paige you are not together now, but you were.
Well, if the note really did come out of that thing<eos> I say we get a crowbar and see what else is in there.<eos> It's not a pinata, Hanna.<eos> - It's a doomsday machine.<eos> - It's about to be garbage.<eos> That's us, digging up Rollins.<eos> A.D. knows we killed him.<eos> What the hell does that mean?<eos> Thank you.<eos> You said you'd tell me today... about the game.
Previously on "Pretty Little Liars..."<eos> - Read the tag.<eos> - He wants us to play.<eos> No, Em, it wants to play with us.<eos> Hannah, Katherine Daly.<eos> I'm doing a fundraiser for my dad and I'd love to wear something new.<eos> I would be thrilled if you wore
Well, if the note really did come out of that thing I say we get a crowbar and see what else is in there.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's us digging up Rollins.<eos> A.D. knows we killed him.<eos> - Can it see us or not?<eos> - Guess.<eos> It's punishing Hanna for attacking it with a steak knife.<eos> - This is ridiculous.<eos> - Emily.<eos> If this person knows we killed Rollins...<eos> Why are you giving them that much power?
Yeah, not enough to play this game. Okay.<eos> I'm done.<eos> I mean it.<eos> Okay. She doesn't just get to walk out like that.<eos> I may have been the one driving the car but we have to be in this together.<eos> We are, Hanna.<eos> We are.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Hi, uh, sorry.<eos> I just noticed you were coming out of Ezra Fitz's loft.
You and Ali have your own weird history.<eos> When you told me what she did that night on my porch, I...<eos> I fell for you hard.<eos> Wanted to protect you ever since.<eos> I'd like to think I'm a little stronger now.<eos> You are.<eos> We all are.<eos> Post it.<eos> I've got to get to a budget meeting.<eos> Addison, I didn't know you were in here.
You're late to first period.<eos> Yeah, well, it's computer lab.<eos> I've been typing since I was two.<eos> Why did you miss yesterday's practice?<eos> I went home early.<eos> I was sick.<eos> Mmm. You seemed to have recovered pretty quickly.<eos> It was a headache.<eos> Why, are you sorry it wasn't a tumor?<eos> You should get to class.
We could stop and have a nice lunch...<eos> Who was on the phone?<eos> Was it dad?<eos> How long is he gonna put off coming home to face me?<eos> Honey, your father's not avoiding you.<eos> He'll be back this Thursday.<eos> He's left you several messages.<eos> Yeah, this isn't really the kind of conversation I wanna have while he's in a hotel lobby.<eos> He's hurting too, Spencer.<eos> This isn't how either one of us wanted you to find out.
- Addison...<eos> - She gets too close.<eos> And touchy, and it's not just me<eos> Chelsea Lopez is freaked out too.<eos> I took a picture at last Saturday's meet.<eos> I'll show you.<eos> She's always brushing her hand up against Chelsea's thigh.<eos> Always?<eos> That was Coach Fields' first meet.<eos> I-I don't know why I can't find it, but if you saw this photo you'd understand why everyone's so uncomfortable.
You sure you really want this?<eos> You've seen some gruesome stuff, Spencer.<eos> And this person could've been the one who pulled the trigger.<eos> She wasn't, she...<eos> I don't see her that way anymore.<eos> Where did you find it in the house?<eos> The letter.<eos> Your parents hung on to it.<eos> They might still know where to contact her.<eos> Detective Furey, I believe you've been looking for me?

- Where have you been?<eos> - Hiding.<eos> But I can't do that anymore.<eos> I need to tell somebody the truth.<eos> We're not alone right now, Ms. Marshall.<eos> I know.<eos> I can hear her breathe.<eos> Hello, Spencer.<eos> Are you sure he's dead?<eos> If you're referring to Noel Kahn, yes.

Hello, is anyone there?<eos> Hello, may I help you?<eos> I'm still holding for Claudia.<eos> May I have your name please?<eos> I've left three messages.<eos> Hanna Marin.<eos> 'I'm sorry.<eos> Could you repeat that please?<eos> ' Marin.<eos> Look, you're sitting at my old desk if she doesn't wanna talk to me, then...
I'll wait in the car.<eos> No, it's not your father.<eos> It's, uh, it's a realtor.<eos> Your dad and I have decided to sell this house.<eos> What?<eos> When?<eos> We figured the sooner the better.<eos> Severing ties with this town would be healthy for all of us.<eos> I didn't tell you this morning because I...<eos> I knew that you were already hurting, and I didn't want to...
Hm. That's my suggestion.<eos> Who brought you back to Rosewood this time?<eos> Why do you assume I didn't come alone?<eos> Because you couldn't make a dress from a stolen sketch without a little help.<eos> You better think twice about why you came back to town, Jenna.<eos> The cops are already punching holes in that little bedtime story about you and Noel.<eos> Well, they shouldn't.<eos> Because the last time I checked, the only person who could contradict that story was dead.<eos> Mr. Tenerelli, are you here?<eos> Mr. Tenerelli, are you in here?
Thanks.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> What is this about?<eos> This is about you, and where you were yesterday when you were supposed to be here.<eos> And what you're willing to do to protect a lie.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> You know exactly how dangerous you are.<eos> And if you don't retract those accusations then I'll have to share some pretty damaging evidence about your extracurricular activities behind The Brew.<eos> So now you're following me too?

- Archer Dunhill's, yes.<eos> The prints were a match.<eos> Do you have any idea who sent it or why?<eos> It seems like some sort of taunt or a game.<eos> This morning our forensics' team confirmed that the finger was detached from tissue that have been decomposing for some time.<eos> Possibly around the time that Archer Dunhill disappeared in the first place.<eos> We're now treating this case as a homicide.<eos> I know that this is difficult...<eos> But I do hope that we can count on your help with this investigation.<eos> Anything that you can tell us about anyone that might have had a motive or held a grudge.

No you can't.<eos> - This isn't happening.<eos> - Yes, is is.<eos> No, A.D. doesn't get to poison Caleb bankrupt Lucas' company, ruin my reputation and then expose us for murder all in one go. No.<eos> - Hanna.<eos> - What?<eos> Where are the rules for this stupid game anyways?<eos> Every time we fail a turn, the cops get of a piece of Archer?<eos> What's next, his knee caps or his ear lobes?<eos> Or the video of you two digging up the grave.
At us.<eos> So did I.<eos> But coming back here was a mistake.<eos> Doesn't have to be.<eos> I thought I was over high school.<eos> But it's really hard to be over a place when you're smack dab in it and it feels like so much hasn't changed.<eos> You and Allie are still keeping secrets.<eos> I told you, it's not what you think it is.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> But when I see you two whispering in the hallway it takes me right back to high school too.
Are you sure?<eos> Maybe at a neighbor's house or...<eos> No, sorry.<eos> I guess we wrote down the wrong address.<eos> I'm glad you did.<eos> I can't tell you how great it is to see you.<eos> Tell me what you've been up to, I heard you're in New York working for some big time designer and you got engaged?<eos> Well, that didn't really work out.<eos> Both the engagement and New York thing.<eos> Well, you'll figure it out, you're resilient beyond measure, both of you.
I wonder why A.D. wants you to go in a baby clothes store?<eos> Come on, we need to find that puzzle piece.<eos> It's-it's Ezra, I 'll be right there.<eos> Someone moved your piece off the game board.<eos> Do you want to lose?<eos> I don't wanna lose, I want out.<eos> _<eos> Hi, it's Julie, we spoke on the phone.<eos> Right, hi.<eos> I was worried you wouldn't make it before closing.

Actually I've already decided.<eos> I'm staying.<eos> How did it go?<eos> - Fine.<eos> - Oh, wait.<eos> Don't forget, the item you asked us to put on hold.<eos> For the donor.<eos> What?<eos> What did you say?<eos> You asked us to put this on hold for the egg donor.
Are you okay?<eos> - Do you need to sit down?<eos> - Where is it?<eos> What, what are you looking for?<eos> The puzzle piece.<eos> They must have told you to put it somewhere.<eos> - I'm not sure.<eos> - I need it.<eos> Okay, I need that damn puzzle piece.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't know what piece you're talking about.
The puzzle piece.<eos> They must have told you to put it somewhere.<eos> - I'm not sure.<eos> - I need it.<eos> Okay, I need that damn puzzle piece.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't know what piece you're talking about.<eos> You're donating your eggs.<eos> My eggs and I made the decision.<eos> They're my eggs and I made the decision.<eos> You have arrived at your destination.
No one's okay.<eos> - Em, she doesn't know.<eos> I don't know what?<eos> That A.D. stopped playing games and started playing God.<eos> A.D. stole Emily's eggs from the donation bank fertilized them and then used them to impregnate Allie.<eos> - What?<eos> - God, it still sounds crazy.<eos> Guys...<eos> Um, I don't know what to say.<eos> No one can imagine how violated and confused you both must feel right now but Aria's turn is up next and who knows what A.D.'s gonna do to her.
Oh, my God, that is so annoying.<eos> Why can't we just lock it up in Ali's house?<eos> I mean, she's out of town this weekend, right?<eos> That's a spectacular idea.<eos> Actually, kind of unspectacular.<eos> I mean, a crying baby is the last thing Ali needs to hear when she comes back.<eos> She's got a lot on her mind.<eos> Why'd she go away again?<eos> A-Ali has something to deal with.<eos> You know, paperwork.
Being able to focus on him really got me tethered to something real...<eos> Aria?<eos> Just knowing that out there in the world...<eos> Hey, if you wanna watch that, we can...<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Just another reminder that there's nothing I can do until Ezra's done helping her.<eos> Obviously, she still needs him.<eos> Uh, guys, please don't give me the sad eyes.<eos> You two found your way back to each other.
Then she lied to me.<eos> I mean, is she taking Jenna to the eye doctor?<eos> Another favor?<eos> I say we get there first and find out.<eos> - Is it working? - Yeah.<eos> I'm just dropping off the deposit for a surgical procedure.<eos> - Patient name?<eos> - Marshal.<eos> Jenna Marshal.<eos> While you're here, would you like to schedule your procedure?
So beautiful.<eos> I've been so caught up in my own soap opera lately I forgot that I'm not the first person to have a complicated story about a birth mother and a surrogate mother.<eos> You don't have to drive yourself crazy choosing between the two.<eos> All you have to do is... Love the people that want the best for you.<eos> Hey, Sydney, got a minute?<eos> - Did you follow me?<eos> - I had to, you lied to me.<eos> Here's what's gonna happen.<eos> We're gonna take a nice little drive to go visit your friend Jenna.<eos> And on the way there, you're gonna tell us about how the two of you know someone with the initials A.D.
- I had to, you lied to me.<eos> Here's what's gonna happen.<eos> We're gonna take a nice little drive to go visit your friend Jenna.<eos> And on the way there, you're gonna tell us about how the two of you know someone with the initials A.D.<eos> I'm not going anywhere with you.<eos> Well, if you walk away, we'll just keep showing up.<eos> Yoga at Ludlow Street, drinks with your friends at 9 PM.<eos> You wouldn't want that now, would you?<eos> This is insane.<eos> How do you even know my schedule?
and we'll get out of your hair.<eos> Tell your Chihuahua to keep her paws to herself and maybe I'll talk.<eos> Do I have to twist your arm again?<eos> Answer the freakin' question!<eos> I don't know anyone with those initials, okay?<eos> I represent an account holder who prefers to remain anonymous.<eos> I'm just doing my job for a client of the bank.<eos> Yeah, well, where did Jenna run off to?<eos> Is she meeting up with that mysterious but generous client?<eos> If you can't find Jenna, it's 'cause she doesn't want to be found.

- What were you doing tonight?<eos> - Burying a body.<eos> - No. - Maybe he wasn't after all...<eos> But his credit card was.<eos> I requested paper receipts from the hotel.<eos> I'm interested in seeing a signature on that bill.<eos> Once that happens, there's gonna be more questions.<eos> Why didn't you come to the Radley hotel that night?<eos> My friend Emily was working and I wanted a drink.<eos> And did you see Archer Dunhill?
And did you see Archer Dunhill?<eos> - I knew him as Elliot Rollins.<eos> - Did you see him?<eos> No. But that doesn't mean that he wasn't there.<eos> What time did you leave the bar with Detective Furey?<eos> - I knew him as Marco.<eos> - What time did you leave?<eos> I don't know, 11:00?<eos> Don't you have surveillance footage of me?<eos> Do you remember, uh, a joke you made to Detective Furey?

- Yes.<eos> Which of your cards did you pay with?<eos> - I don't remember.<eos> - What was the amount?<eos> - I don't recall.<eos> - Was it $79?<eos> - I don't recall.<eos> - What was...<eos> I don't recall!<eos> You may wanna wait for me to ask the question first.
I am not asking you to lie for me.<eos> I'm just asking you to just..<eos> just... please let this one slip through the cracks.<eos> Please, just this once.<eos> You can do that, can't you?<eos> I guess you didn't know me as well as you thought.<eos> I've got to get that.<eos> You've got to go.<eos> Yeah, I can come in.<eos> You have all files there?
You have all files there?<eos> Yeah, uh, just give me about five minutes to get out of here.<eos> Alright.<eos> What does Lucas have to do with this?<eos> I don't know, I didn't ask.<eos> I was too busy committing the theft.<eos> Can you state your name please?<eos> Wait, I recognize this.<eos> This is from after Charlotte's murder.<eos> You claim you were at the hotel with Miss Marin.

Hanna, he just threw you under the bus.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - Shall I rewind it so we can see him back it over you?<eos> He got busted so he told the truth.<eos> He's weak, it doesn't make him sick.<eos> And what about destroying Ali's memorial?<eos> Stealing Caleb's money, joining Mona's army.<eos> I mean he has a dark side, Hanna.<eos> We all do when we're pushed hard enough.<eos> I don't care how many videos you show me he's my friend, just like every one of you.
Are we gonna get to continue your journey with Nicole?<eos> No, I'm afraid not.<eos> I am about to start another journey<eos> I am getting married to Aria Montgomery my co-author, and this story may be about Nicole but my inspiration in work, in life and in every sense of the word, is Aria.<eos> What a monster.<eos> I know that Lucas destroyed your memorial but do we really think he's as disgusting as all this?<eos> I could kick myself.<eos> I was so close to catching him.<eos> I'm just glad he didn't hurt you guys.<eos> He clearly didn't expect you to be home.
So now you're sending body parts.<eos> What the hell is she talking about?<eos> If you don't know, why are you so freaked out?<eos> Because of the book.<eos> Because of my friendship with Charles.<eos> I figured he found out.<eos> But I swear, I swear that I didn't know that he..<eos> She was the one who was torturing you.<eos> I didn't think that he and Charlotte were the same person.<eos> You just said that you stayed friends.
Previously on "Pretty Little Liars..."<eos> Mona knows about the game.<eos> She know the answer before you even ask the question.<eos> Okay, we don't need your theories.<eos> I guess you're forgetting who replaced the shattered windshield once you peeled Dunhill off of it.
Did it?<eos> My understanding is, he was a good cop but that here in Rosewood, he seemed... distracted.<eos> Does that seem like a fair characterization?<eos> I really couldn't say.<eos> Nothing in your relationship led you to believe that he was conflicted in his approach to solving the murder of Archer Dunhill?<eos> Furey told me everything, Miss Hastings.<eos> From bar stools, to ping pong right before he took himself off the case.<eos> I'm giving you a chance to tell the truth.<eos> But I guess... old habits die hard.<eos> I am impressed by how well you played him.

But then again, I remember how adept you and your friends are at that sort of thing.<eos> - That's not fair.<eos> - Fairness. It's overrated.<eos> Truth is what counts.<eos> Well, I would say that it's good to see you but under these circumstances...<eos> You should know something.<eos> I'm a closer.<eos> I asked to have this investigation.<eos> I am going to get to the bottom of what happened to Dunhill and how you and your friends are involved.<eos> I've always felt that you were guilty in some way, I just... never knew how.
This makes me really want to go to jail.<eos> What're we doing to stay out of jail?<eos> - Has anyone heard from Aria?<eos> - No.<eos> 'Cause she doesn't have one of these.<eos> Okay, guys, I know we all woke up early and we're cranky, but let's stay focused.<eos> I'm as freaked out as the rest of you.<eos> Maybe even more, considering it looks like.<eos> A.D. was watching Ali and me sleep last night.<eos> Wait, so are you two...
When the game connects, I might be able to find his location.<eos> No wonder they call you "Too genius, too furious."<eos> No one calls me that.<eos> Wait, we ordered food?<eos> Yeah, before we realized that none of us was hungry.<eos> My God.<eos> Is that the same one from the game?<eos> I think so.<eos> "Just one plea, the rest go free.<eos> If no one steps up, you all go down."
Yeah, before we realized that none of us was hungry.<eos> My God.<eos> Is that the same one from the game?<eos> I think so.<eos> "Just one plea, the rest go free.<eos> If no one steps up, you all go down."<eos> I don't understand.<eos> He wants us to choose one of us to go to jail.<eos> Or we all go.<eos> If you want an explanation, you might try asking Aria.
No.<eos> But Aria was.<eos> Okay, guys, come on.<eos> Aria would never do something like that.<eos> I saw her get a puzzle piece in the brew.<eos> It was hidden for her and she knew where to find it.<eos> I also managed to access a portion of an unsettling phone call Aria had today.<eos> With who?<eos> I've earned my way on your team.<eos> You owe me.

I'm not happy about this.<eos> Whether you choose to believe me or not...<eos> Concrete proof.<eos> Just remember you asked for it.<eos> Well, search warrants were served on multiple locations this morning.<eos> No, ma'am, I can't tell you exactly when but from what I've seen so far it does indicate that we should be able to file charges within a week.<eos> I will.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Lieutenant Tanner. - Yeah?<eos> - You need to see this. - Okay.
My God. Mona was right.<eos> Mona?<eos> What has Mona have to do...<eos> Were you in our nursery?<eos> Did you put the recording in Spencer's house?<eos> I mean, did A.D. ask you to do this and in return give you a puzzle piece?<eos> I can explain.<eos> Aria, we literally caught you blackhooded.<eos> Why would you do this for A.D.?<eos> Do you remember when we found out Ezra was writing a book about Alison and hid it from us, from me?
So, what?<eos> It was just a nobrainer of you to pick Ezra over us?<eos> Guys, I didn't know what to do.<eos> You could have talked to us. Okay?<eos> We're friends, since forever.<eos> That's what we do.<eos> Do you know anything about "Choose or loose"<eos> or the timer?<eos> - No.<eos> What are you...
Piece of glass was retrieved from Ms. Hasting's shower drain this morning.<eos> A windshield fragment.<eos> Interesting, since the car belonging to an acquaintance of yours, Lucas Gottesman recently had its windshield replaced.<eos> Lots of cars get their windshields replaced.<eos> But the piece of glass in question also matches a fragment found under the fingernails of the deceased, Mr. Dunhill.<eos> We're also analyzing your search history in your computers.<eos> Honestly, it surprises me just how few people take advantage of the privacy settings.<eos> - What else?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> What else do you have?

No matter what happens next no matter what each of us decides to do we swear that the rest of us will understand.<eos> No one will be blamed... for anything.<eos> I swear.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I swear.<eos> I'll tell you what our choice is.<eos> Why didn't we think of that earlier?<eos> - Okay, what now?<eos> - We're supposed to wait here?<eos> That's exactly what you should do.
Dammit!<eos> Take the next left.<eos> Pull over.<eos> - Here?<eos> - Pull over.<eos> This is it.<eos> The location of the cell tower that the gamer's been using to communicate.<eos> Where are we?<eos> Mona lives a block away.<eos> You've reached Spencer.
I am going to get to the bottom of what happened to Dunhill and how you and your friends were involved.<eos> You will not call me back, you will do it now.<eos> Well, wake the judge up.<eos> I need signatures on those arrest warrants and they cannot wait until morning.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I-I just dropped my keys in the trunk, and my release isn't working so I called a friend of mine who has another set of my keys in there, almost here so, it's all good.<eos> But thank you, though.<eos> Let's see if we can save your friend a trip.<eos> Seriously, it's-it's okay.<eos> You know have to...
But thank you, though.<eos> Let's see if we can save your friend a trip.<eos> Seriously, it's-it's okay.<eos> You know have to...<eos> If it's just something caught in the release we may be able to shake it loose.<eos> My friend is, is almost here so, I don't wanna waste your time.<eos> Part of the job.<eos> Like getting cats out of trees.<eos> That's firemen.<eos> Seriously, you don't have to... do this.
- Goodnight.<eos> - Goodnight.<eos> Are you absolutely sure about this?<eos> Mona has the game.<eos> She not only has it, she's accessing the guts of the thing.<eos> You can see that by the signals.<eos> It's her game.<eos> Hanna, Mona's A.D.<eos> The good thing is that we know and she doesn't know that we know.<eos> I'm just glad that you didn't bust in on her.
- Not alone, you won't.<eos> Aria's still not answering her phone.<eos> What I can't understand is how you could do this just cut her off like that?<eos> Okay, Ezra, you have to understand...<eos> Understand what, Spencer?<eos> That she's screwed up?<eos> That she got scared and made a mistake?<eos> There isn't a person in this room who hasn't made a big mistake and doesn't have to live live with it.<eos> Do you know what makes A.D. so dangerous?<eos> She can't forgive, that is the only edge any of you ever have had over her and now you don't even have that.
What is it?<eos> This.<eos> The Lost Woods?<eos> It's mine, free and clear.<eos> I put the deed in your name.<eos> Yours and Alison's.<eos> But why?<eos> I know what's happening.<eos> With the police.<eos> You'll need money for lawyers, all of you.
How scared she was.<eos> The note telling her to get out.<eos> A.D. doesn't get messages, they send messages.<eos> - Poor Mona.<eos> - What did you just say?<eos> She always wanted to be in charge of everything.<eos> She ends up middle management.<eos> That's gotta hurt.<eos> Hanna and I are married.<eos> You mean you're going to get married?
God, she's a riot.<eos> What is she doing here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I have the typed copy of your statement.<eos> I'd like to go over the major points one more time.<eos> Of course.<eos> Well...<eos> I killed Archer Dunhill.<eos> I ran him over with a car that I stole and I buried his body in the woods.<eos> Later I moved it to where I told you you'd find it.
Then I tried to cover it up.<eos> How?<eos> I arranged with someone to make it look like Dunhill was still alive.<eos> Who was your accomplice?<eos> I'm not gonna tell you.<eos> That person had no idea what I'd done.<eos> The only thing that they were guilty of was helping someone in trouble.<eos> Do you know why your niece and her friends were at that farm tonight?<eos> They must have figured out it was me.<eos> You were getting ready to accuse them.

I can give him Mary Drake and a logical story about her and Dunhill or I can give him a box of loose ends with theories that might be true... but no one could ever prove.<eos> I know which version he wants.<eos> Do you believe Mary?<eos> I am convinced that Mary Drake is guilty of at least one homicide.<eos> She did kill her sister.<eos> And that's enough to send her where she can hurt no one ever again.<eos> Do you believe that she killed Archer Dunhill?<eos> What I believe and what I can prove are two different things.<eos> Go home.<eos> You're not criminals.
I don't think so.<eos> You sure?<eos> I'm positive.<eos> Our love was real, Sara.<eos> Past tense.<eos> I still love you.<eos> Everything's set, boss.<eos> Good.<eos> Got to give you credit.<eos> You'll go the whole nine yards to help one man steal another man's wife.
Michael didn't kill Harlan Gaines.<eos> He had no motive.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> - He's the one with the motive.<eos> Harlan Gaines was your CIA director and he was looking into Jacob.<eos> He was gonna put him prison.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Tape her mouth shut, please.<eos> Tape it shut.<eos> If you do, an innocent man dies, and the real killer walks.
I got your map.<eos> I'm gonna get you and your mother out of here.<eos> I didn't draw a map.<eos> We need to run.<eos> Wait.<eos> What are you doing up here, Van?<eos> I just want to make sure that we're getting the right guy.<eos> Ask him some questions.<eos> Let my son go.<eos> Do whatever you want with me.
If he gets caught, he's going back to the pen.<eos> - Come on, come on.<eos> - I'm not... And if I don't do it?<eos> Criminy, I want you free and clear, and if that's the only way to do it, then I got to be the one that does it.<eos> Scofield ain't gonna do it.<eos> He don't got the killing gene.<eos> No one is getting caught.<eos> There's a very specific order to this.<eos> Sara, I want you to make sure Linc's safe and out of harm's way.<eos> Whip, T-Bag, you're gonna collect a wild card for us.
Federal agents!<eos> Hands where I can see 'em!<eos> - Hands up!<eos> - Burrows!<eos> Do it now!<eos> I need your help.<eos> I need to find my boy.<eos> Here.<eos> He's an evil man and he's got my son.<eos> You've got to know someone.
Do it now!<eos> I need your help.<eos> I need to find my boy.<eos> Here.<eos> He's an evil man and he's got my son.<eos> You've got to know someone.<eos> Something.<eos> Some way I can get my boy back.<eos> Please.<eos> You sure this is where my son is?
Except none of this will be here.<eos> And neither will I.<eos> Bastard!<eos> This is for the last seven years.<eos> Freeze!<eos> Get your hands up!<eos> Put 'em up!<eos> It's him!<eos> It's Kaniel Outis!<eos> Thank God you're here.
It's him!<eos> It's Kaniel Outis!<eos> Thank God you're here.<eos> Thank God!<eos> Hands up!<eos> Thank God you guys got here when you did, that's all I can say.<eos> I mean, he would have...<eos> I'd be dead right now.<eos> Look, if it's okay with you guys, I'd like to go home, clean myself up a bit.<eos> As you can imagine, it's been a long day.

He was a cancer inside your agency for years.<eos> I've shown you his face!<eos> Now, calm down.<eos> You should know that we have Mr. Ness' accomplice,<eos> Andrew Nelson, in custody, thanks to your brother,<eos> Once we saw your e-mail, we interrogated him.<eos> He's fully disclosed 21-Void's conspiracy to frame you for the murder of Harlan Gaines and bury your identity by giving you a new one:<eos> Kaniel Outis.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means... you're free to go, Mr. Scofield.

Why would she be hanging out with Alison?<eos> She's gonna tell her about it, I know it.<eos> Yeah, 'cause she's kissing me to mess with you.<eos> She's hanging out with Alison and Lydia and taking us all to the Roxy to mess with you.<eos> That's not what's happening right now. You gotta listen to me, man.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know what it is, but something's wrong.<eos> Everyone's weird, man. That's your guilt talking.<eos> I'm gonna tell Ali about it.<eos> You just fixed things with Ali. You can't tell Ali.
- You're insane.<eos> Ouch.<eos> What else have you lied about?<eos> You're the only one who gets to lie?<eos> This is crazy.<eos> This isn't crazy.<eos> Give it time.<eos> Thank you for coming in, Mrs. Viola.<eos> And I wouldn't worry just yet, okay?<eos> We'll be keeping an eye on her behavior here at school. You keep an eye on her at home.
Get cover!<eos> Fire in the hole.<eos> Take cover!<eos> We think of everything.<eos> So all four dead men were shot by Mr. Deaux here?<eos> That's right.<eos> Just comes in through the back window, blasting away, drops every one of them?<eos> Yep.<eos> Why you?<eos> What do you mean, "Why me"?

Mr. Deaux by kidnapping you?<eos> Well...<eos> I guess...<eos> It may have gotten back to Mr. Boss that I had developed, um, feelings for Miss Charles.<eos> - And those feelings were...<eos> - Unreciprocated.<eos> Yeah, but, boy...<eos> Talk about grand gestures.<eos> "Unreciprocated," she said.<eos> You didn't get that down.
She told that me that Seattle was going to be the capital of a zombie homeland.<eos> A zombie...<eos> People weren't going to want to see that happen.<eos> Yeah, I could see a few close-minded people objecting.<eos> She wanted to know if I was with her or against her.<eos> With or against her how?<eos> What does that even mean?<eos> Well, I think it means that Fillmore-Graves wants to make Seattle a zombie-friendly city.<eos> "Zombie-friendly"?<eos> Like, "Eat all the brains you want, we'll make more"?
Honestly, Don E.<eos> Nothing has made sense to me lately.<eos> You know when I figured it out?<eos> - Figured what out?<eos> - I'd just been shot.<eos> Several times.<eos> I mean, zombie or not, bullets hurt.<eos> And I'm lying there, praying that Mr. Boss' dimwit henchman doesn't shoot me in the head.<eos> And then suddenly it all became clear.<eos> You made all this happen.
It's going to be awkward.<eos> I'm going to have to talk to all the people I kidnapped and drill down on whether they saw anything that might get me to Natalie.<eos> Uh, Major...<eos> A hero's return.<eos> It's gonna get bad now.<eos> Now that you've been cleared.<eos> You think?<eos> _<eos> I was hoping to talk to you about that girl, Natalie.<eos> If you remember anything, call me back on this number.

So far so good, the Chaos Killer victims are coming through like champs.<eos> I downloaded Major and Clive on what you told me, about Seattle being a zombie homeland.<eos> I'm guessing I'm the only non-zombie in the loop.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Far from it.<eos> We probably have a couple dozen human employees who are fully briefed.<eos> But those are humans I know and trust.<eos> Clive has already witnessed a full-scale zombie outbreak.<eos> That's a genie that can't really be put back in a bottle.<eos> We want to know what you mean when you talk about Seattle being a zombie homeland.
We here at Fillmore-Graves are preparing for D-Day.<eos> Discovery Day, the day when humans, en masse, learn of our existence.<eos> What do you think happens then, Liv?<eos> I thought it would be in our best interests if it didn't get out.<eos> Maybe it won't, but it probably will.<eos> So what happens when it does?<eos> What happens when humans learn that there's a few hundred brain-eating, highly-contagious zombies in their midst?<eos> Do you think they'll ask us to raise our hands and then they're gonna do their best to help us survive and assimilate?<eos> Do you think they'll help us get the brains we need to survive?<eos> Where do you get your brains?

Where do you get your brains?<eos> You see what I'm talking about?<eos> It's a touchy subject.<eos> There are several crematorium owners here in the Pacific Northwest who are paying cash for houses in upscale neighborhoods for doing nothing more than de-braining the deceased and sending those brains our way.<eos> But nobody's answered my question.<eos> What happens on D-Day?<eos> They exterminate us.<eos> Oh, check out the big brain on Major.<eos> We here at Fillmore-Graves do not plan on going gently into that good night.<eos> What do you plan on doing?
They exterminate us.<eos> Oh, check out the big brain on Major.<eos> We here at Fillmore-Graves do not plan on going gently into that good night.<eos> What do you plan on doing?<eos> Well, for a start, we're well-armed and well-trained.<eos> We're also the proud owners of the formula for Super Max.<eos> No one else gets it.<eos> Max Rager is no longer.<eos> And with Super Max, we are faster, stronger, and have more endurance than the humans who would annihilate us.<eos> Can we get a straight answer on what you mean when you say,

They're my family.<eos> I'm mother to them all.<eos> - So all of these kids are...<eos> - Undead.<eos> - Hello, Miss Vivian!<eos> - Hello, children.<eos> - Clive?<eos> - Wally?<eos> Hey.<eos> So this is where you've been hiding out.
You better head back to class.<eos> I'll give Miss Vivian my information to give to your mom.<eos> We'll get together.<eos> Promise?<eos> Yeah, I promise.<eos> You should tan and dye.<eos> Wally...<eos> How do you...<eos> His family lived in my building for a while.<eos> You mind?
Because I'm spiraling, and I can't break out of it.<eos> Spiraling about what?<eos> Peyton.<eos> And Blaine.<eos> And my sitting out in the car while Blaine was cowboying up, saving the day.<eos> And I have this movie in my head of the object of my affection, my precious, dear, sweet, smart Peyton in the throes of passion with oily, teen-murdering Blaine.<eos> Get over it.<eos> You're not an ideal shoulder to lean on when rolling on soldier brain.<eos> You called her "my precious."<eos> You don't plan on throwing her in Mount Doom, do you?

That's not how I'd do it.<eos> I'm close to full memory restoration.<eos> For 17 lucky zombies.<eos> What about the rest?<eos> I don't like thinking about that.<eos> Well, who'll decide who gets the cure?<eos> I don't like thinking about that, either.<eos> Ravi!<eos> Clive!<eos> - Good, you're here.
Welcome, Chuck Burd Nation!<eos> Gather around patriots, truth-seekers and those who believe we need to reset the tree of liberty.<eos> And we all know what that sound is, we have a bombshell today, UpChuckers.<eos> - This is it.<eos> - With me in studio right now, is Billy Cook, eyewitness to the bloodbath at the Max Rager headquarters, and what he is about to impart upon us, my friends, is going to confirm everything.<eos> Your government is plotting against you.<eos> We are all slaves.<eos> Slaves!<eos> The only thing is that some of us just don't know it yet.<eos> Billy, if you could tell us who you are and what you saw.

They were in these tubes, kind of like those...<eos> Liv.<eos> Liv, it's gonna be okay.<eos> Like you said, no one but the lunatic fringe listens to this show.<eos> It's not that, Clive.<eos> This brain I'm on is wearing off.<eos> I shot my boyfriend, Clive.<eos> He's dead because of me.<eos> He was already dead.<eos> What you did was merciful.
Volunteers?<eos> Come on now. Just a few more steps.<eos> Ravi.<eos> Always working' late.<eos> Oh, my office?<eos> I could take you to your apartment, Liv.<eos> My car is here.<eos> I'm gonna sleep it off here and... Shower later.<eos> Thanks for listening to me all night, Clive.<eos> I'm glad you know I'm a zombie.

Thanks for listening to me all night, Clive.<eos> I'm glad you know I'm a zombie.<eos> Remember this...<eos> I'm alive, because you did what you did.<eos> I know it hurts right now, but try to remember that when you feel like beating yourself up.<eos> The brain wore off, so...<eos> I'm taking off.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> _<eos> You've reached Ravi's phone.
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend."<eos> That was Kautilya in The Arthashastra.<eos> Pretty sure it was Kirk in Star Trek, but...<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> The enemy of my enemy is you.<eos> And you're loaded.<eos> And I've got a plan to rake in some cash and stick it to your boy.<eos> And I thought maybe you'd like to hear my proposal,<eos> Shark Tank style.<eos> As I can't move and you're well-armed, I'm all ears.
We start our own brain business.<eos> I've got Blaine's customer list, and a fingernail made for scratching'.<eos> Brilliant in its simplicity.<eos> All I need is a little start-up cash.<eos> - So?<eos> - I love it.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> One problem.<eos> What?<eos> You're thinking too small.
What?<eos> You're thinking too small.<eos> I need some aspirin.<eos> And a new brain.<eos> Is that so, Scarecrow?<eos> Well, I need a new heart.<eos> We're off to see the...<eos> Look at that.<eos> You say it, it happens.<eos> What've you got for us today, good sir?
might create an even greater rage effect.<eos> Oh, I agree, but...<eos> What does that look like?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> - You, Miss Moore?<eos> - What does what look like?<eos> That's brain.<eos> In the digestive tract.<eos> Katty, it's been a delight.<eos> I hope you've got what you needed,
The Mikaelson compound.<eos> Midnight.<eos> All right, ladies, do not slow down on me.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> Ooh! I'm getting the next round.<eos> Just take a sec, pull yourselves together.<eos> Another round, please.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Beer, please.<eos> You look like you're having fun.
Just take a sec, pull yourselves together.<eos> Another round, please.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Beer, please.<eos> You look like you're having fun.<eos> What's the occasion?<eos> I just finished my residency, which makes me an official ER doctor.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Does it help with the guilt, given what you are?
Instead, I want the last words you ever hear to be my solemn vow.<eos> I will find your daughter.<eos> And when I do, I will eradicate<eos> Your malignant bloodline from... this... earth.<eos> Well, who's next? !<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Meet... Your... Maker.<eos> Mmm. That is a nasty bite.<eos> The good news is, we have the cure.<eos> You see, keeping Klaus alive does come in handy.
Meet... Your... Maker.<eos> Mmm. That is a nasty bite.<eos> The good news is, we have the cure.<eos> You see, keeping Klaus alive does come in handy.<eos> I keep him for his blood, in case the wolves get out of line.<eos> I keep him as collateral, in case his family comes back.<eos> I keep him, because I can.<eos> I put him down, I kept him down, and I am the only one that can stop him from coming after all of you.<eos> New Orleans is mine.<eos> But you are all welcome to visit.

Well, let's go celebrate.<eos> Laekna det som er toxicatus. Close your eyes, you blood-sucking punk-ass.<eos> You just... you waved your hand and his brain melted?<eos> Well, that's what happens when people annoy me.<eos> Your bite is nasty.<eos> But you're outnumbered.<eos> Give up now and we'll end this quick.<eos> I have a better idea.<eos> Did it work?<eos> You want more?
Why else keep me in such close proximity?<eos> You need me.<eos> If only to keep from becoming the monster you fear yourself to be.<eos> For all your power, you remain in my thrall.<eos> You still cannot escape the shadow I cast.<eos> That is how I know you'll be back.<eos> You need me, marcellus.<eos> Because deep down inside You are weak.<eos> Maxine.<eos> What you doing here?
Where are you?<eos> What have I done?<eos> What have we done?<eos> I told you to stay upstairs with the rest of the wounded.<eos> Do you need another shot?<eos> Do Miller and Jackson have everything they need up there? Yeah.<eos> They blame us for the chip.<eos> It's not safe for us here anymore.<eos> Good.<eos> You're down.
Raven...<eos> - They need a doctor.<eos> Roan?<eos> He got shot trying to help me. I thought he was dead.<eos> Not yet, but he's close.<eos> No exit wound.<eos> We need to get the bullet out quickly.<eos> Get away from our king. Wait.<eos> Please, no.<eos> You're making a mistake.
My people will protect you.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> How many times have they cast you out?<eos> It's different now. They owe me, ok?<eos> Please.<eos> Come on.<eos> We can still pick up a few things first, right?<eos> Sir, that's everyone we could find.<eos> Stationed 10 guards at the temple door. Are you sure you don't want me to stay?<eos> You lead them home, Major.
What is it?<eos> Do you know what I said about being safe with my people?<eos> Your plan was better. Let's go.<eos> Before you say anything, remember, I saved your life by taking you out of Mount Weather.<eos> I'm sorry I couldn't tell you to bring the girl, but I was following orders, Bellamy.<eos> I wish it was that easy.<eos> Today, you guys.<eos> I need more time.<eos> I know how it feels to lose someone you care about to war, but we do what we do for our people.<eos> You slaughter us, we slaughter you.
I need more time.<eos> I know how it feels to lose someone you care about to war, but we do what we do for our people.<eos> You slaughter us, we slaughter you.<eos> That all went away in the City of Light, but it's back now,<eos> so here we are.<eos> The bullet is pressing against his carotid.<eos> It's cutting off blood flow to his brain.<eos> As soon as I get it out, he should wake up.<eos> What are the terms of your surrender?<eos> We recognize Ice Nation rule, and you honor Lexa's coalition, including the 13th clan.
Take it.<eos> The clans will follow you.<eos> That's what you want.<eos> I want what's best for my people, same as you.<eos> Then help me save them.<eos> Roan, listen to me.<eos> You wanted an Ice Nation Commander.<eos> With this, you control who ascends.<eos> There will never be a Commander to rule over Azgeda unless you allow it.<eos> I know you've all come here for an execution, but no one else will die here today.
And there is no Commander left to rule us.<eos> Until another Nightblood ascends,<eos> I...<eos> King Roan of Azgeda, eldest son of Nia, grandson of Theo... am caretaker of the throne<eos> and keeper of the Flame.<eos> Until another ascends, Azgeda honors and will defend the coalition of the last true Commander...<eos> Lexa kom Trikru, including the 13th clan.<eos> Let it be known that an attack against Skaikru is an attack against us all.<eos> From your king.<eos> With this, you'll be safe in any of our lands.
There's about a dozen of them out there... maybe more.<eos> Momma, get away from that door.<eos> That's the first place they're gonna start shootin'.<eos> Put that down and get your rifle primed now.<eos> _<eos> Eli, put that rifle on the floor!<eos> If we give them a fight, they'll kill us!<eos> They're gonna kill us anyway, Momma.<eos> No, not you three.<eos> You're young.
Come on, now.<eos> Leave that.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You can keep your granddad company.<eos> Endive.<eos> Mexican hat.<eos> Good girl.<eos> You're giving me easy ones.<eos> You wanna know what's happening, don't you?<eos> I know you're not gonna tell me.
Niles.<eos> If you're referring to that strung-up cattle rustler, now that you menti it, I might know something about that.<eos> Armando couldn't rustle up supper, let alone 70 head.<eos> He was confederating with the sediciosos, Pete.<eos> Armando cut the fence, and he looked the other way when them Mexers stole your property.<eos> I tell you, my friend, he admitted to all of it.<eos> In the end.<eos> Jesus, Niles.<eos> You and your daddy ain't exactly strangers to backcountry adjudication.<eos> You enlightened plenty of rustlers at the end of a rope.
I love it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're very welcome.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me...<eos> Those real Comanches out there?<eos> Mm-hmm. Our esteemed guests deserve a little authenticity.<eos> Who do you got down there?<eos> Ah, it's a good crowd.<eos> Eight or nine bankers with ties to this part of the state, all looking for a place to park their cash.<eos> John Barton's the first man I want you to meet.

Phineas, if you had the money, would you invest it here, in oil?<eos> I've done dumber things.<eos> So tell me, Pete, what's your plan?<eos> Drink hemlock?<eos> Hang a noose?<eos> Stop sucking the blood out of our core business.<eos> I had to lay off 10 vaqueros to help pay for the oil rig.<eos> Now we're shorthanded, and our fences are unguarded.<eos> That's how these rustlers keep getting away with our livestock.<eos> If blaming me makes you feel better, fine.
If blaming me makes you feel better, fine.<eos> It's your choice got us into this mess.<eos> Cattle ranching's the past.<eos> It's always been there, and it always will be.<eos> It's stable.<eos> It's stagnant.<eos> In this life, if you don't move forward, you die.<eos> Now, in five minutes, I'm gonna go down there and convince these rich bastards that our shit comes out gold-plated, that South Texas is the happiest, safest place on this green Earth.<eos> I'm gonna get them to open up their wallets and give us what we need to create a great Goddamn empire.<eos> You gonna help me do that or not?
How is the colonel?<eos> Still kicking.<eos> For your future, compadre, a piece of my past.<eos> It belonged to my uncle Arturo.<eos> May it continue to bring your family the luck it's brought mine.<eos> Well, I sure do appreciate it.<eos> Do you have time for a smoke with your old friend?<eos> Oh, I'm sure Pete does.<eos> Of course.<eos> Maria told me what you did for my man Armando.

You know, I never knew a place like this could exist.<eos> You need to eat.<eos> I'll bet our tracks will be covered up by the wind.<eos> They're gonna kill you if you don't eat.<eos> They're gonna kill me anyway.<eos> I thought for sure I'd go to Harvard.<eos> I wrote Emerson about 10 letters, but I never got a chance to send any of them.<eos> I'd like to think he would have taken them seriously, though.<eos> Here. It's not that bad when you get used to it.<eos> I'm sure you have your own name for this.
We're entering the modern age.<eos> If anyone picks up a gun now, it's because we're out for quail or deer.<eos> Yeah. I hear ya.<eos> I've lived all over the West.<eos> And this little patch of South Texas, I decided to call home.<eos> - It's good weather. - Yes, sir.<eos> The sweetest water for 500 miles.<eos> Yeah. Absolutely.<eos> We got oil, we got gas, we got monster bucks and quail comin' out our ears!<eos> So there's a good reason I chose to raise my family here, and I'm honored you all could come down and share it with me.
- You're a pro.<eos> Okay, wait. Now, so how many... how many calories you think boogers have?<eos> Ay, don't say that.<eos> What? She probably knows.<eos> You know, right?<eos> - Not just the beans, the meat.<eos> - I'd say snot's pretty low.<eos> Maybe, like, five to ten, depending on the size of the pickin's.<eos> - The meat. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - And you are both being disgusting.
My family was on welfare.<eos> - We had nothing.<eos> - Okay, thank you.<eos> I think I got it.<eos> - You do a lot of sit-ups.<eos> - Not that many.<eos> It wasn't a question.<eos> That's where you get these bruises on your spine.<eos> Your stepmom always talk that much?<eos> You know how sharks have to keep swimming or they'll die?
If I wanna be thin, don't they say that that's better?<eos> I'll outlive the normies.<eos> - You like this? The furry?<eos> - What?<eos> No, I'm not...<eos> Lanugo.<eos> Your body's trying to keep you warm by making more hair.<eos> But you know that, right?<eos> I talk to kids like you all day, every day.<eos> So, I know that you are, as a rule, full of shit.
Uh, you know, we didn't have much time to talk, but he's on his way home.<eos> Dad's coming?<eos> - He's on his way, but he said not to wait.<eos> - So, he's not coming.<eos> Hey, what happened to that sweet girl that I met at Transitions?<eos> - The Mexican.<eos> - Angel?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Her mom's from El Salvador.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> You two seemed very close.
How are you feeling right now, Pearl?<eos> It's okay.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just... that it's hard getting better.<eos> And I'm guessing that you're worried about how you're gonna be burning it off, especially when everybody's here watching you?<eos> Do you know why you feel that way?<eos> - Because I... have an addiction?<eos> - In a way, yes.<eos> When the exercise and the rituals kick in and... the cyclical thoughts about weight take over, everything else goes away.<eos> And starving yourself can make you feel euphoric, like a drug addict or an alcoholic.

It doesn't exist.<eos> What you crave is the numbing of the thing that you don't wanna feel.

You look like a ghost.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Why?<eos> Mom, it's okay, it's okay.<eos> My God.<eos> - No dad?<eos> - I'm sorry, work.<eos> Well, he has to support his family... and pay alimony, still, and the medical bills and...<eos> Understood.<eos> Bet you didn't expect this much "gynergy" today.
- Because of the blog?<eos> - Tumblr.<eos> - Yeah, and that's bad enough, but now, people wanna be like her and look like her and go through what she's going through.<eos> Nobody died because of Ellen's artwork, okay?<eos> There's plenty of stuff out there for people to fetishize.<eos> But that certainly didn't help, to have notoriety for starving...<eos> But that's what I'm saying.<eos> - Ellen has talent.<eos> - I didn't say she doesn't.<eos> But if you hadn't made her take her artwork away from her audience, she might have found her voice.
Um, right.<eos> Well, I'd better...<eos> Right, right, right. Yes.<eos> - See you tomorrow?<eos> - Where else would I be?<eos> Epic.<eos> Step on.<eos> - Unless you wanna face the other way.<eos> - No, I'm good.<eos> I didn't sew rocks into my panties, if you're worried.
So, I find out I can pull the patient ID thing all the way up my arm and hide it underneath my T-shirt, and I just get out past the nurse's station, I just walk out.<eos> - Where were you even going?<eos> - The beach?<eos> I don't even know.<eos> But there I am, just jogging down Wilshire Boulevard.<eos> I'm a full-on crazy person, and I'm jogging at the light...<eos> when my mom drives up.<eos> - She was on the way to the hospital.<eos> She just gets a bit nauseous because of, um... the chemo.<eos> You don't like it?
- No.<eos> My mother took me there to make me feel shitty, you know, about starving.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We're Jewish.<eos> Damn, Dr. Beck.<eos> Are you trying to turn me straight?<eos> That's a different program.<eos> - Hi, everyone.<eos> - Hey!<eos> Okay, so this place we're going, I had to pull some strings to get us in there, so you have to behave.
- It's okay, I promise.<eos> - I don't believe you.<eos> What is it?<eos> Art.<eos> Somebody tell me why we're here!<eos> Because we're alive.<eos> Very good.<eos> Here you go.<eos> You're shaking like a chihuahua.<eos> I know what you're trying to do.
- It's a big rexie thing.<eos> - No.<eos> Not really.<eos> Let's talk about that "really."<eos> Just normal shit.<eos> The second you get boobs, it's like open season.<eos> You guys are pretty disgusting that way.<eos> We could at least have some manners about it. Not rub up against you guys on the bus.<eos> Oh, bus rubbing. Titty grabbing... gross dirty talk... night stalking...<eos> You're all basically just a bunch of portable holes for men to fuck.
How's Megan?<eos> She's at the hospital.<eos> She's fine now, physically.<eos> She's not sure she wants to come back here... which I understand.<eos> Can we visit her?<eos> Not yet, but I think, in a few days, that's exactly what she needs.<eos> I wanna go home.<eos> I bet you do.<eos> Listen. Bad things are going to happen. That's not negotiable.<eos> What is, is how you deal with it.
That baby was never gonna make it.<eos> - Where is Luke, anyway?<eos> - He's at the doctor for his knee.<eos> Eli?<eos> Eli.<eos> What's going on with you?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Lobo tells me you're about a day away from getting the tube.<eos> You've been making progress, but you can't stay at Threshold if you drop any more weight.<eos> I just think it's so weird that you know everything about me... and I don't know anything about you.

Okay, what do you wanna know?<eos> - Do you have a wife?<eos> - No.<eos> - Do you have kids?<eos> - No.<eos> So, what's your damage?<eos> Short version, my work.<eos> It takes up all my time, and I... I like it that way.<eos> Women generally wanna spend time with somebody they date.<eos> Sounds like you're avoiding intimacy, doctor.

That would be easier, right?<eos> Then you could write him off.<eos> - Does he talk to you about me?<eos> - You know I can't answer that.<eos> - I just don't see the point.<eos> - In what?<eos> There is no point.<eos> Or at least, big picture, we don't get to know what it is.<eos> Why we live, why Megan lost the baby, why that girl killed herself.<eos> - You're not reassuring me, doctor.
Was this like I had essentially been smoking my entire childhood?<eos> If processed meats are labeled the same as cigarettes, how is it even legal for kids to be eating this way?<eos> I thought this was new information, but, many of these studies have been around for 50 years.<eos> I couldn't believe I'd been eating processed meats virtually my entire life and was just now finding out how dangerous they are.<eos> Why hadn't I been hearing about it from the American Cancer Society, the largest cancer group in the nation?<eos> When I went on their website, I was shocked to see that none of this information was featured on their home page.<eos> But, even more shocking, on their Eat Healthy page, they actually encouraged eating Group One carcinogenic foods like processed turkey and canned meats.<eos> This is after the World Health Organization reviewed over 800 studies definitively linking processed meat to cancer.<eos> Thanks for calling your American Cancer Society. My name is Sam, I'm a cancer information specialist.<eos> Yeah, I was calling because I was wondering why you all recommend people to eat processed meat on your website, which the World Health Organization has classified as a Group One carcinogen?
It's the food!<eos> It's what the Americans are eating.<eos> Today, with 2/3 of Americans being overweight, clearly there's a food issue.<eos> In the next 25 years, one out of every three Americans will have diabetes.<eos> My name's Michael Abdalla.<eos> I'm from Atlanta, Georgia.<eos> And unfortunately, I was diagnosed about 10 years ago with diabetes.<eos> And eight years ago I had two stents put in.<eos> I don't know where to go, I don't know what to do, you are just like out of options and you don't know what to do.<eos> You're taking medicines. You listen to this doctor.

Government and media almost exclusively blame lack of exercise and sugary foods as a cause of diabetes.<eos> But, I wanted to talk with an actual expert on the role of diet and diabetes.<eos> I went to speak with premier physician, diabetes expert and researcher, Dr. Neal Barnard.<eos> What role does sugar play in causing diabetes?<eos> Driving me crazy.<eos> Diabetes is not and never was caused be eating a high carbohydrate diet, and it's not caused by eating sugar.<eos> The cause of diabetes is a diet that builds up the amount of fat into the blood.<eos> I'm talking about a typical meat-based, animal-based diet.<eos> You can look into the muscle cells of the human body, and you find that they're building up tiny particles of fat that's causing insulin resistance.<eos> What that means is, the sugar that is naturally from the foods that you're eating can't get into the cells where it belongs.
We had always been told that sugar or obesity caused it.<eos> Renowned weight loss bariatric surgeon Dr. Garth Davis, though, agreed.<eos> Everyone thinks that you get diabetic because of carbs.<eos> They did a huge study in that EPIC study 500,000 people, carbs consumption was inversely related with diabetes.<eos> In other words, the more carbs someone ate, the less diabetes they had.<eos> But, meat was strongly correlated.<eos> Get that aha moment.<eos> The starch is, the carbs are good for you.<eos> They're not bad for you.<eos> This idea that carbs make you fat is utterly ridiculous.

The starch is, the carbs are good for you.<eos> They're not bad for you.<eos> This idea that carbs make you fat is utterly ridiculous.<eos> Carbs cannot make you fat in and of themselves.<eos> We have storage in our muscles and in our liver for carbs called glycogen.<eos> So, when we eat carbs, we either store it or we burn it.<eos> Now eat fat, that goes straight to your fat.<eos> Your body can't turn those carbs into fat unless you're really overdoing the calories.<eos> And obesity, it's a death sentence.<eos> You're at much higher risk of getting cancer, you're almost certainly gonna get diabetes.
I go into the hospital and I look around me, people on dialysis, all these sick people.<eos> And just about every disease in there is because of what people are eating.<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> If I eat a sugary cookie, the sugar lures you in like the Trojan horse, but waiting inside that cookie is a huge load of butter or, shortening.<eos> And that's what fattens you up.<eos> And that's the part that leads to the diabetes, it's the fatty foods, not really so much the sugar.<eos> It's not that sugar's good for you.<eos> There's no nutrients in it.<eos> It's excess calories.<eos> But, when you eat sugar, you don't get inflammation right away.

I take a nap, I'm still tired.<eos> I can't breathe.<eos> And I know I need to make a change for my health.<eos> Or, else I'm not gonna be here for my family.<eos> When we speak of heart disease, I would say the role of alcohol is pretty small.<eos> The role of sugar is very small, too.<eos> Smoking is big, but, the good news is that most people have quit or never did smoke.<eos> The problem with animal-based diet, its contribution to heart disease is huge, and it is pervasive.<eos> All this expensive imaging, procedures, bypasses, medication.<eos> None of which has one solitary single thing to do with the causation of the illness, so you dive a completely benign, food borne illness that never had its causation treated.

A brilliant advertising campaign has convinced people that oh, it's white meat, it's healthier.<eos> The leading source of Sodium, in the American diet for adults is chicken.<eos> It can be labeled all natural chicken but, be injected with salt water.<eos> I think up to 800 milligrams of sodium.<eos> Heterocyclic amines are clear-cut carcinogens, and they can form in any kind of meat as it's heated, as it's cooked.<eos> But, by far, the biggest source is chicken.<eos> We sent researchers into fast food and family restaurants.<eos> Not only were there carcinogens in every single restaurant, but, we found them in every single chicken sample that we took.<eos> If somebody brings their family in, and they're buying a bucket of chicken, nobody tells them that there are carcinogens.<eos> If you're selling carcinogens to people, you've gotta warn them that they're in there.
It changes our hormone levels. It raises our cholesterol levels.<eos> There's nothing healthy about eating the yolk of the egg.<eos> But I thought cholesterol and saturated fat wasn't an issue anymore.<eos> All these saturated fat studies that have come out, trying to vindicate saturated fat is a campaign by the dairy industry, wherein the number one source of saturated fat is dairy, it's not meat.<eos> 2008, the global dairy industry got together at a meeting and explicitly read their agenda, was to neutralize the negative impact of milk fat by regulators and medical professionals unquote, so what do they do, they funded studies.<eos> The main study that started the whole saturated fat media craze was funded by the National Dairy Council.<eos> The egg industry similarly funds studies that confuse consumers by making claims that eggs don't negatively affect heart function.<eos> That is, only when compared to eating a McDonald's Sausage McMuffin?<eos> So, what they're really saying is that eating eggs is just as bad as eating a McMuffin.<eos> When you eat foods, like a beef or, steak or, a processed meat, a hotdog, you're not just getting saturated fat.

Confusion is their game.<eos> I really don't think people thought what they ate led to heart disease.<eos> They think, "Oh, it's genetic, my parents had it."<eos> I don't think people really think that what they ate led to diabetes,<eos> I think, "Oh, my parents had it, I was gonna get it," and certainly cancer, they don't think that way.<eos> People have bad lifestyles that they've inherited.<eos> Environmentally, they've been exposed to a certain way of eating and living that they've carried on into their adulthood, passed onto their children, that is why they go on to develop the same diseases that their parents and grandparents may have had before them.<eos> But it is not inevitable.<eos> Even if you have a genetic predisposition, doesn't mean it's going to necessarily manifest.<eos> And what determines whether it manifests or not may be those epigenetic variables, the things that you can control.
It's like this menu is trying to give people heart attacks.<eos> On your website, we noticed Heart-Healthy Recipes and we were kind of bewildered by why there was a bunch of recipes on, a whole section on beef, beef recipes.<eos> And there was also a section on egg recipes when there's such a strong link between beef, red meat and heart disease.<eos> I honestly don't know 'cause I don't do that, I guess.<eos> That's not what what I do.<eos> Another organization rep that wasn't able to answer my questions.<eos> But, he said that he'd have someone get in touch shortly.<eos> I was, however, able to talk to the president of the American College of Cardiology, Dr. Kim Williams.<eos> So, the American College of Cardiology is a 47,000-member and growing organization with a dedicated mission to reduce heart disease and to improve patients' lives.<eos> And if you look at the incidents of hypertension and diabetes and mortality in men, they actually get reduced as you go higher and higher in terms of how much you restrict animal products.

So, you can get exposed to them by living near these incinerators and breathing it, but, it will take you 14 years to breathe in as much Dioxin as a cow will ingest by eating the grass in one day.<eos> And that Dioxin will accumulate in its fat, which includes the milk and the meat and anyone eating meat or dairy products is gonna get that dose of Dioxin.<eos> So, it climbs up the food chain in every step.<eos> Men have no way in their bodies to get rid of dioxins, but, women have two ways.<eos> They're both involving having a baby.<eos> One is that dioxin crosses the placenta into the growing infant and the other is that it comes out from the breast milk.<eos> So, if you have a meat and dairy-consuming mother breastfeeding that infant, then the highest impacts of toxic exposure like mercury and dioxins will go to that infant.<eos> Pregnant women are told, "Certain types of fish should be avoided,"<eos> but, what about all these other animal products which are introducing, imagine as the fetus is developing, introducing these very harmful toxins which, create reproductive abnormalities, develop mental problems and hormonal issues right as the child is developing, the most critical stage of development.<eos> It does make you worry when people say, "Don't you wanna have a little bit of milk because you're pregnant?

Commercial animals are largely fed GMO corn and soy which are very laden in pesticides.<eos> PCBs have been banned since the 70s, but, they persist in the environment, dioxins.<eos> All of these compounds can create hormonal, reproductive, developmental damage as well.<eos> Eating organic beef, poultry, pork or fish will not help you avoid contaminants like mercury, like dioxins, like strontium-90 because they fall out over all sorts of farm fields and water bodies, and then they don't skip over the organic fields.<eos> And so really, the contaminants are coming in regardless of how these animals are raised.<eos> I had always been concerned about the possible health impacts of GMOs but, then found out that most of the world's GMO crops are actually consumed by livestock, with dairy cows consuming the most per animal.<eos> This fact, with everything I learned about bioaccumulation made dairy terrifying.<eos> Especially considering how much cheese I ate in my life.<eos> Cheese is an amazing product when you think about it.<eos> It's probably one of the single best foods in compromising health that you're gonna actually feed to people.

Our government is encouraging Americans of color to eat foods that it knows is going to make them ill.<eos> Ultimately, what that boils down to is the government is telling me as an African American to eat food that's gonna make me ill for no health benefit so that it will benefit dairy farmers.<eos> That's a form of institutionalized racism.<eos> Yeah, milk is a risky food for human consumption.<eos> As a pediatrician, I see on a daily basis children suffering from conditions that are linked or associated to dairy consumption such as eczema, acne, constipation, acid reflux, iron deficiency, anemia.<eos> Cow's milk protein is the most allergenic food.<eos> People think, "Well, no, I want hormone-free, not injected with bovine growth hormone."<eos> But milk is this hormonal fluid, so it's just packed with sex hormones and natural sex steroid hormones like estrogen, progesterone, in fact, doesn't matter if it's conventional milk, doesn't matter if it's organic milk.<eos> Milk without hormones, that's an oxymoron.<eos> Organic dairy has just as much saturated fat and cholesterol and galactose, all the things that you don't want, as conventional dairy.

So, we need to reduce the growth factors in our body, like IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor one, it's this cancer-promoting growth hormone involved in every stage of cancer cell growth and spread and metastases.<eos> Any animal protein boosts the level of IGF-1.<eos> Dairy products increases your risk for various forms of cancer, especially those related to your hormones.<eos> So, breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer.<eos> So, this is not a product even in its most pure state you wanna be consuming because it does come with risk.<eos> I found out that dairy can increase a man's chance of getting prostate cancer by 34%.<eos> And for women who've had breast cancer, just one serving of whole dairy a day can increase their chance of dying from the disease 49% and dying from anything 64%.<eos> Why weren't breast cancer sites like Susan G. Komen warning everyone about this?<eos> Thanks for calling Susan G. Komen, this is Jocelyn, how may I help you?<eos> Yes, so we're wondering why you don't have a huge warning about the dangers of consuming dairy on your website when there's a direct link to breast cancer.
Although, it was confusing to see pink ribbons on dairy yogurt containers.<eos> Breast cancer can be prevented with a healthy diet and lifestyle, but, we're not.<eos> We're talking about pink ribbons and putting all the money into research for the cure.<eos> I, for one, know that I would want my daughter, my mother, me, I want to focus on not getting to that point.<eos> And that's where I would like to see more energy and effort put.<eos> I had been a hardcore cheese-aholic virtually my entire life, despite the risks.<eos> But, like so many others, I seem to have been addicted to it.<eos> It turns out that the casein protein, that's the main protein in dairy products, and particularly in cheese, it breaks apart in the human digestion to create what are called casopmorphins.<eos> Casein-derived, morphine-like compounds that go to the brain and they attach to the very same receptor that heroin attaches to.<eos> Don't get me wrong, they're not as strong as that, but, they are strong enough to make you come back again and again and again despite the fact that you're gaining weight, you're more unhealthy than you've ever been, but, that cheese just calls out to people.
Antibiotic residues are found in the meat, other antimicrobials are found in meat.<eos> There has been ractopamine found in meat, there has been hormones found in meat, so right there, you're talking about four different drugs that could be in the same piece of meat.<eos> The pharmaceutical company is supposed to show the safety of animal drugs.<eos> They're not really testing to see what the impacts of these drugs are on humans.<eos> They're really looking to see what the impacts of these drugs are on animals.<eos> When we try to get information on some of the health studies and the environmental studies from federal agencies, we get back page after page of blacked out information because the company claimed confidential business information.<eos> Consumers have no idea what is in the products that they consume.<eos> So, how sick something makes me and how bad it pollutes the environment is a secret for a company.<eos> In the animal agriculture industry, as in the tobacco industry, these companies really have a vested interest in making sure that the public doesn't have information about their effects and what risks are really posed to consuming them.<eos> You have this system where animals are living in their own waste, they're living next to animals that are sick or, even dead, and they're stuck in cages with these animals, that bacteria tends to spread, that the pathogens that are being created

You get an infection in your leg, and you cut your leg off.<eos> So, you have this very dangerous situation.<eos> By crowding these animals in, they become a perfect engine for generating a new flu virus that can come out into the community.<eos> If you lived near a swine spray field, not even the CAFO but the waste disposal field, you are three times more likely to have a MRSA infection.
We've already had bouts of swine flu, or H1N1, as they prefer to refer to it.<eos> That particular swine flu incident was originated on a farm here in North Carolina.<eos> There's approximately the same number of hogs in North Carolina as there are people.<eos> Between eight to 10 times the amount of feces is produced by a hog, an adult hog as compared to an adult human.<eos> 10 million pigs in North Carolina produce the waste equal to a hundred million humans.<eos> This is the equivalent of the entire US Eastern Seaboard flushing their toilets into North Carolina.<eos> But, there is no waste treatment.<eos> The pigs' waste falls through slats in the floors of the sheds they are forced to live in, it is then pumped into giant waste pits, which leech into rivers and streams and is pumped out unfiltered onto fields,<eos> further polluting the environment and neighboring health.<eos> When you go back and you look at where these hog facilities are located, there's a disproportionate number of them that are located near communities of color.
further polluting the environment and neighboring health.<eos> When you go back and you look at where these hog facilities are located, there's a disproportionate number of them that are located near communities of color.<eos> Low-income communities.<eos> It is definitely a human rights issue.<eos> My sister, she have asthma, you know.<eos> Her brother, he have asthma.<eos> He's three.<eos> And we don't know what she might have.<eos> I have asthma, I have sinus, I have sarcoidosis, that's of the bacteria, and I have a pacemaker, which is sick sinus syndrome.<eos> But, you know, mostly everybody in this neighborhood got asthma or, either cancer.
My nephew down the street, he's got cancer, he's in terminal cancer, stage four.<eos> Not a smoker, not a drinker.<eos> And it's not in his lungs, it's in his lymph nodes.<eos> Now see if you live here and saw the way they do, we don't eat no pork.<eos> Well, I don't eat bacon because I know where it come from.<eos> When they die, they go into a box, and they decompose because they swell from the heat.<eos> A truck come and pick 'em up, take 'em to the processing plant in Rose Hill, ground 'em up into feed, and feed it back to the hogs.<eos> If I come out this door, if he's spraying there, it's gonna come in my face.<eos> It hits you right in the face.<eos> Smell like something that you have never smelled before.
During the funeral.<eos> Yeah, they spray.<eos> And when the people come, everybody be closing their nose up saying how it stink.<eos> They can want a cookout on Sunday, he'll spray.<eos> Do you think he does it on purpose? I think so.<eos> 'Cause he just sprays Sunday.<eos> He always sprays Sunday.<eos> And in most of these area, hog houses and turkey house, it's in a black area or the Hispanic area.<eos> It's either or.<eos> Do you think it's also a civil rights issue?

I don't believe there's sufficient evidence to demonstrate that.<eos> How does it compare to the ADA diet that you recommend?<eos> We don't recommend a specific diet, we recommend healthy eating.<eos> The one that's on the website.<eos> We recommend healthy eating.<eos> There is...<eos> Do you have a whole list of exact day-to-day, the meal plan, the whole meal plan?<eos> All they are are selections of foods to consider.<eos> We do not have a diabetes diet.<eos> But, with that, selections that you consider, that plan compared to an all plant-based plan.
But, if it's a diet that's not the proper diet, like if anyone follows a diet that they eat McDonald's...<eos> I can't tell you what a proper diet is.<eos> I can tell you what an improper diet is.<eos> So, then we can talk about the good diets.<eos> I'm not sure why...<eos> I'm not gonna get into that.<eos> - Into diet?<eos> - No.<eos> Why not?<eos> If that's where you want to go with this, I'm sorry, I'm not the person that you should be talking to.

I'm not gonna get into the argument with you.<eos> Why is it in argument?<eos> It's just to talking about in European study of diabetes and other places that have studies, why...<eos> There are lots of studies...<eos> Why is it even an argument, I guess?<eos> There are lots of studies in the literature.<eos> Many of which have never been replicated or frankly, are wrong.<eos> That's why we do peer review, okay?<eos> The European Association of Study of Diabetes has been peer-reviewed or, the...<eos> I don't know what study you're referring to, and in the absence of being able to see that study,
Every single one of these organizations was taking money from meat and dairy companies that are associated with the causes of these diseases.<eos> This would be like the American Lung Association taking money from the tobacco industry.<eos> I was sick of not getting answers.<eos> So, I went to the headquarters of these organizations myself.<eos> We have to speak to someone in person.<eos> There's millions of people dying from the foods that they are recommending people to eat.<eos> I wanted to find out why Susan G. Komen had accepted $35 million from Yoplait, when their products can increase a woman's chance of dying from breast cancer 49%, and ask American Cancer Society if taking money from KFC and Tyson was a reason they promote eating meat.<eos> But, every one of these organizations declined to be interviewed.<eos> What's really sad is that we cannot trust information from these leading health organizations like the American Heart Association, the American Diabetes Association because they are taking money from the very industries who are causing the problems that they're supposed to be helping to prevent.<eos> So, that makes the truth something that you are not gonna be hearing, as far as nutrition goes, from these organizations.
So, that makes the truth something that you are not gonna be hearing, as far as nutrition goes, from these organizations.<eos> Well, that would be the end of their funding, that would be the end of their jobs, there would be lawsuits that would bring the entire catastrophe down upon their heads, and they would essentially disappear as organizations.<eos> This one time I got invited to a charity fundraiser for the American Diabetes Association.<eos> I showed up, and they had a whole buffet, and it was all just animal products.<eos> I remember like a big thing of barbecue chicken.<eos> And I was like, I stormed out.<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> We had scheduled to film an interview with a prominent surgeon.<eos> But, before we could get inside the building, the hospital's media relations manager stopped us.<eos> Actually I understand that Dr... said that you could film here today, but, unfortunately, that's not gonna be able to happen.

The committee who writes these guidelines has been made up of individuals who have received money from McDonald's, the National Dairy Council, the American Meat Institute, the National Dairy Board, the National Livestock and Meat Board, the American Egg Board, Dannon,<eos> candy and sugar companies, Coca Cola and Anheuser, just to name a few.<eos> Which means we are getting our dietary recommendations from the very industries that are killing us.<eos> And when they, the USDA, makes a pyramid or a Power Plate every five years for the American public, they're gonna guarantee that on that plate are gonna be foods, which when consumed, will result in millions of Americans perishing.<eos> The USDA, which is supposed to be protecting us, has two missions.<eos> It's supposed to protect us, and it's supposed to protect the producer.<eos> And guess what, when those two come head to head, they usually choose the producer.<eos> In internal documents uncovered by Dr. Greger, the USDA admitted that eggs cannot legally be called nutritious, low fat, part of a balanced diet, low calorie, healthful, healthy, can't say it's good for you or, even safe.<eos> Yet they still promote these products to the American people through federal checkoff programs.<eos> If you ask somebody if they have heard of a checkoff program, the odds are they haven't, although daily, they are seeing the messaging that these programs produce.
Yet they still promote these products to the American people through federal checkoff programs.<eos> If you ask somebody if they have heard of a checkoff program, the odds are they haven't, although daily, they are seeing the messaging that these programs produce.<eos> So, checkoff programs are responsible for the messages that we see on TV, on the Internet, on buzz billboards and magazines that say things like,<eos> "Milk, it does a body good," or "milk life.<eos> Beef, it's what's for dinner.<eos> Pork, be inspired.<eos> The incredible edible egg."<eos> The dairy checkoff program gave $12 million to Domino's to just market cheese-heavy product.<eos> And this is the USDA, this is the government.<eos> If you've seen those ads for the Pizza Hut pizza, the stuffed crust or a pound of cheese.
How can we put more cheese on beef?<eos> How can we put more milk in a coffee?<eos> Things like that to just drive consumption of these just unbelievably unhealthful products.<eos> So, McDonald's, for instance, has six people staffed full-time, according to records we found, whose salaries are paid for by this government program but, funded by the producers who are regulated by it.<eos> And these six people sit there at McDonald's headquarters and just come up with ideas.<eos> Triple cheese decker McCheese muffin stuffed bacon cheese slider?<eos> With extra cheese?<eos> - Nice!<eos> - Yes!<eos> You don't think of it on a day-to-day basis that these are government programs.

We know that they spend at least $138 million lobbying Congress.<eos> We expect that they spend a good deal more than that in figures that simply aren't publicly disclosed.<eos> The industry's lobbying power is so strong that they can create laws and push through legislation that doesn't benefit Americans in any way, such as ag-gag laws that criminalize whistle-blowing or photographing abuses by this industry.<eos> Activists in the US can be charged as terrorists for disrupting the profits of any business that uses animals, under the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, to the even more ridiculous ones like cheeseburger laws.<eos> A cheeseburger law is a law that says a plaintiff cannot recover against a manufacturer, distributor or, retailer, on the theory that the food made the plaintiff obese or caused an obesity related disease.<eos> Cheeseburger laws are a direct response to a problem that the tobacco industry has had.<eos> Big Tobacco has paid $400 billion to state Medicaid programs.<eos> Cheeseburger laws proponents say,<eos> "We don't want to see the same kind of thing happen "to the meat and dairy industries."<eos> The fact that these laws are based on a model template called a Commonsense Consumption Act is actually ironic because what they're saying is you, the consumer, should have the common sense to know that our food is bad for you.
Some of these meds are for diabetes.<eos> This is for peeing.<eos> I have to use this for my prostrate.<eos> And then I have to use this for the heart.<eos> And I have to use this for blood pressure.<eos> And it's just on and on and on.<eos> The doctors are telling me this is what I gotta do for my whole life.<eos> And it's frustrating and very stressful.<eos> And I don't know how long my liver is gonna last taking all this stuff.<eos> Under conventional medical treatment, whether it be for autoimmune disease or even conditions like high blood pressure or, diabetes, you're told that you have to take drugs.

USDA operates like the military.<eos> So, when I got on TV and that right away,<eos> USDA sent out memos to all the veterinarians and food inspectors,<eos> "If anybody from the media ever contacts you, do not talk to them.<eos> Refer 'em to Washington DC, and we will talk to them."<eos> So, right away, it shut up everybody.<eos> American public should be very concerned about this.<eos> What's going on with USDA?<eos> Here in the United States, we have at least four cases of mad cow disease, but, I'm almost positive there's more cases than that, but, the government isn't looking for it.<eos> What you're saying is that there could be already mad cow's disease in humans.
I personally don't think it's safe to eat it because of the fact how the line speeds are increasing and also our inspectors are not well trained enough.<eos> At the present time, the line speed now is going about 220 cows an hour.<eos> That gives you about, somewheres around four cows per minute.<eos> So, that's 15 seconds per cow.<eos> These dangerous slaughter speeds means that animal waste ends up everywhere.<eos> Testing shows 88% of pork chops are contaminated with fecal bacteria.<eos> 90% of ground beef and 95% of chicken breast sampled contained animal waste bacteria.<eos> There is nothing clean about eating this way.<eos> But, it just isn't waste, it's also pus-filled infections.<eos> You could see there's a bump or some kind of abscess underneath the hide.
Most of the time when the hide's pulled off, either that will open up the abscess and the the pus will come out, or if it's deep-seated, when the inspectors are doing their work or the company employees, they might stick their knife<eos> into an abscess, and it explodes all over the place.<eos> I had heard enough.<eos> I was utterly disgusted by the corruption, the greed, the disease and the abuse I was learning about.<eos> The very animals we were killing were killing us and the planet.<eos> But, so many people eat meat and dairy every day of their lives.<eos> And we are so concerned about getting enough protein.<eos> Do we have to eat meat to get complete protein?<eos> Oh, my God, oh my God.<eos> You want me to jump off this building, don't you now?
Do we have to eat meat to get complete protein?<eos> Oh, my God, oh my God.<eos> You want me to jump off this building, don't you now?<eos> Well first of all, all protein is made by plants.<eos> I'll state that again for the record.<eos> All protein is initially made by plants, all of it.<eos> And it is not necessary to eat animal tissue in order to get protein.<eos> Only plants have the ability to actually take nitrogen from the air, break those molecules apart and incorporate that nitrogen into amino acids and then make protein.<eos> Any protein you get from an animal is simply recycled plant protein.<eos> If you ate a diet that was calorically adequate and even things like brown rice and broccoli and you got enough of it, you'd get enough, both quantity and quality of protein.

Beans are loaded with protein.<eos> Vegetables are loaded with protein.<eos> You really want to get your protein from plants because plant proteins have a much more beneficial effect on our physiology.
That's the fluid that's been designed by evolution over millions of years.<eos> And that's just like the perfect food for human babies.<eos> Perfect food, lowest protein content, any other mammal, and so gives a sense of kinda protein requirements...<eos> - It's lower than...<eos> - Anything, so look...<eos> - Lower protein than even...<eos> - Than rat milk, ape milk.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Donkey milk, any milk that's ever been tested.<eos> And you hear this a lot in body builders who are like, "Well, I need chicken, or, I need fish to be strong, to build muscle tissue."
And you hear this a lot in body builders who are like, "Well, I need chicken, or, I need fish to be strong, to build muscle tissue."<eos> That is utter nonsense.<eos> The largest, strongest terrestrial animals on the planet are all herbivores.<eos> The biggest, strongest animals are all herbivores.<eos> When we bring in people and they're on meaty diets and we transition them to a plant-based diet, we always track what they're eating.<eos> Their vitamin intake goes up.<eos> Their nutrition overall goes up, dramatically better.<eos> And these same people might worry in advance,<eos> "Will I get the nutrition that I need on a plant-based diet?"<eos> The fact is, you're not getting the nutrition you need on a meat-based diet, and you're gonna get dramatically better nutrition on a plant-based diet.

We may behave like omnivores, but, anatomically, we're frugivores.<eos> Human beings, unlike bears and raccoons and to some extent, dogs, don't have that mixed anatomy and physiology that you see in the true omnivores, and thus, we are not true omnivores.<eos> In humans, the canines have become really small and rounded and actually function like accessory incisors.<eos> They're utterly useless for ripping and tearing anything other than an envelope.<eos> So, the idea that the mere presence of the canine somehow means that we're supposed to eat meat is silly.<eos> He was right.<eos> I always thought my canines were for meat, but, what kind of animal could actually kill and eat raw with these tiny teeth?<eos> The thought alone was disgusting.<eos> I mean, everybody loves a smoothie made with fruit and even some vegetables.<eos> But, if you think about putting a fish or a piece of beef in a blender and grinding it up, the thought is absolutely repulsive.

'Cause it's not just heart disease.<eos> It's hypertension, it's diabetes, it's strokes, it's heart attacks, it's several of the autoimmune diseases, lupus, asthma, GERD, osteoporosis, there's a multitude of diseases.<eos> Even rheumatoid arthritis, it can be so dramatic when you see these poor souls just absolutely crippled with rheumatoid arthritis go plant-based, and then they come off their medication.<eos> I wanted to follow up with Jane Chapman who had been suffering from severe osteoarthritis, and I could not believe what I saw after only a few weeks of fasting and changing her diet.<eos> Those are so amazing to see you like this only a few weeks later.<eos> I know!<eos> From going from the walker, needing wheelchair assistance at the airport to strolling down the street, enjoying the fresh air, the sunshine.<eos> Two weeks, it's all it took, two weeks to get off all the meds and start to feel the inflammation just kind of drain out of the body where the movement was much easier.<eos> Just a lot of healing occurred very rapidly just by doing the right things for your body.<eos> When you're treating diseases with drugs, you know there's one drug you take for cholesterol, a different class of drugs you take for high blood pressure, different class of drugs you take for diabetes, but, with diet, a plant-based diet affects all these diseases.

After a year, the cancer was completely gone.<eos> And my thyroid had shrunk to normal size.<eos> And I was completely free of that.<eos> This was tough to believe.<eos> Couldn't this all just be from eating healthier, though, like no sugar?<eos> Turns out Dr. Walter Kempner from Duke University back in the 1940s was reversing some of our worst killer diseases with diet alone.<eos> And the diet he was using was not only strictly plant-based but, it was made up of white rice, fruit and table sugar.<eos> And he was reversing diabetes, he was reversing malignant hypertension, reversing heart disease, the diabetic complications, reversing diabetic blindness.<eos> So, these people basically had death sentences, went to him, and were given basically sugar.<eos> You know, this horrible diet, but, it was strictly plant-based.
Even the family physicians, the surgeons, all the mainstream medical groups came out opposed.<eos> It's seven hours.<eos> That's a lot.<eos> Even if it's over one four-year period.<eos> So, they're not just kinda neutral, but, they're actually actively opposing nutrition education.<eos> Ironically, when patients come to doctors with questions, they assume that the doctor knows something about nutrition and so it's kind of a double whammy that doctors haven't been taught much about nutrition.<eos> Why don't we hear about this from dietitians when nutrition is their entire specialty?<eos> Turns out the American Nutrition and Dietetics Association puts out nutrition fact sheets written by the industries themselves.<eos> The industries pay $20,000 per fact sheet and explicitly take part in writing them.<eos> So, you can learn about eggs from the egg industry.

I feel so blessed and so good and just so happy to be doing this and I'm hoping that I can be a role model for other people and not be pushy about it.<eos> Because everyone's gonna do it in their own time.<eos> But, thank God my time is now.<eos> That's pretty cool.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Thanks!<eos> As powerful as Amy's story was, I knew for some, eating a hundred percent plant-based would still seem extreme.<eos> I think there's the sense that everything's okay in moderation.<eos> But we haven't seen that moderation works.<eos> There really isn't a study that shows that by eating meat and eggs in moderation you can actually turn your heart disease around and get better.
Yeah, it's unlikely that anybody's symptoms are caused by dead decaying flesh deficiency.<eos> The lack of highly processed animal food products in the diet is not gonna be associated with the causal factor by why they're sick.<eos> There is gonna be a reason why they're not feeling well, but, that's not gonna be one of them.<eos> So, I've had people go vegan, and they come back to me and they're like,<eos> "I'm hypothyroid and my doctor says I'm hypothyroid because "plant-based diet makes you hypothyroid."<eos> I'm like, so what does your doctor tell all his meat eaters that are hypothyroid?<eos> What's in animal flesh or dairy that you can't get in plant-based?<eos> Cholesterol.<eos> Heterocyclic amines.<eos> E. coli, you know, if you think about it, there is nothing in an animal-based diet that you can't get in a healthier form somewhere else.
It's just like I need meat because I'm a Capricorn or I need meat 'cause I have an A plus blood, it's like what do you say?<eos> No one has to eat meat.<eos> There's no vitamin, mineral, nutrient that you can't get from non-animal sources.<eos> Valentine's Day, I decided to go vegan and give up all meat, which was never in my thoughts in a while million years, but I've heard so much success from people that are vegan.<eos> And so I gave up all animal product whatsoever, I've lost 29 pounds, I've been able to cut my meds in half,<eos> In the last six weeks, we've just had three grandchildren.<eos> And my ugly face is going to be around to see 'em graduate from high school and college.<eos> I'm gonna be here.<eos> My mission is to let everybody know you do not have to suffer from diabetes and cancer and heart disease because someone in your family had it or because the doctors are telling you this is what's gonna happen.<eos> You can take charge of your health and have a positive outcome just like I did.
You can take charge of your health and have a positive outcome just like I did.<eos> The reason I'm so committed to this is my grandmother had diabetes, and I didn't know what I know now about healing the body.<eos> And if I did, I feel like she could've lived at least a few years longer.<eos> And so it's in her honor that I do what I do.<eos> If I could save someone else's grandmother, aunt, uncle, father from that.<eos> So, I'm excited about getting the message out there.<eos> There's a common belief that eating plant-based is expensive.<eos> Not at all.<eos> It can be done in a very inexpensive way where you buy foods that are in season and you shop in the bulk bins and that saves a lot of money.<eos> You can eliminate a lot of your expenses on your grocery bill by not buying meat and dairy because those things are expensive.
That's for an entire week of food.<eos> An exploding movement of elite athletes are utilizing vegan diets to heal injuries, speed recovery times and enhance their performance.<eos> Before I was vegan, I was only bench pressing 315 like five times.<eos> Then, after going vegan, I was doing 400.<eos> 425, 465, and I was like, oh my God, this is amazing, I'm vegan and I'm bench pressing<eos> 465 pounds, this is ridiculous.<eos> And as soon as I went vegan, tendinitis started disappearing.<eos> My strength in my right arm started coming back.<eos> High blood pressure was going down.<eos> You can't be strong and be dying on the inside, that's not strong.

For something like Ninja Warrior and parkour, specifically, you really need to have a good strength to body weight ratio, so I was carrying mass that I really didn't need.
Every aspect of my life has been improved by adopting this lifestyle.<eos> I feel better, I perform better athletically, I sleep better, my energy with my kids is better, my focus at work is better.<eos> Everything is better, my skin cleared up. I've kept myself trim for nine years now doing this.<eos> All I can tell you is that I felt and I continue to feel better than I ever felt before.<eos> My friend Jason Lester and I were the first people to do this challenge called Epic Five, which entailed doing five Ironmans on five Hawaiian islands in under a week.<eos> An Ironman is a 2.4 mile swim followed by a 112 mile bike and then running a marathon 26.2 miles after that, so we did five of those in a row on five different islands in a little under a week.<eos> Did you almost die?<eos> No.<eos> We didn't die.<eos> So, I guess the famous question, where'd you get your protein, man?
I felt amazing.<eos> I competed in my first marathon in six years, training half the amount and beat my personal record by 23 minutes.<eos> Less than a month later, I did my first full Ironman.<eos> Although I could possibly get away with eating a little bit of meat and dairy without ill effects to my personal health, I could no longer willingly support an industry I knew was causing so much suffering to communities, families and all life on the planet.<eos> A whole new world opened up.<eos> I felt whole again.<eos> Connected to a greater sense of what true health is.<eos> And where true health doesn't end with me, but begins with us.<eos> If people adopted a plant-based diet, the changes we would see in our individual health, in our national health situation and in this physical, environmental world we live in, would be so profound.<eos> Today, you can say, I'm not gonna eat that stuff anymore.
This compass belonged to my friend.<eos> What's it doing here?<eos> I could ask the same of you.<eos> I'm here to see the master.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Hold my broom.<eos> And I'll go find him.<eos> How did you do that?<eos> A lot of practice.<eos> You're the master.

Have a seat.<eos> I've made you some food.<eos> You knew I was coming.<eos> Well, I have prepared some rice every night since you arrived.<eos> I can't believe I wasted all this time.<eos> If you think your time here has been wasted, you've a lot to learn.<eos> Show me how to control my power.<eos> There's people who need my help.<eos> Sunny and Tilda.<eos> And you're all going to Azra together.
Is that right?<eos> This is your home now.<eos> It is our mission to control your gift.<eos> "Gift"?<eos> That's not what I'd call it.<eos> I didn't ask to be here.<eos> So, if it were up to me, I'd leave right now.<eos> Very well.<eos> If you can get past this bird without unleashing your gift, you're free to go.<eos> You're kidding, right?
As much as I enjoy digging up ancient crap, I wanted to talk to you about a greater prize.<eos> One that's right underneath your nose.<eos> Wait.<eos> Do you know what a clipper is?<eos> What?<eos> Do you know what a clipper is?<eos> A clipper!<eos> I'm still waiting on casualty numbers from the refinery but between the oil workers we saved, and the number of refugee cogs coming over our borders, our numbers are swelling.<eos> With the storm that is coming, I hope that I'm worthy of all the faith that these people have placed in me.<eos> I thought you'd be happy.

If I gain the world and lost you, that would be the real tragedy.<eos> Mother, I'd like you to meet Odessa.<eos> She was kept as a doll at the oil refinery.<eos> We all were.<eos> Tilda saved us.<eos> Actually, Odessa took down one of the clippers herself.<eos> A warrior.<eos> Good.<eos> We need as many as we can get for the battles to come.<eos> I hope you'll decide to stay and join our movement.

Let me guess, she didn't give you the answers you wanted.<eos> Have you been reporting on me this whole time?<eos> All of our conversations?<eos> She wanted to know about your progress.<eos> It's my job.<eos> I'm your Abbot.<eos> I trusted you, Ava.<eos> I told you things that I've never told to anybody.<eos> Thank you for your service, Ava, but I'll be personally overseeing this novice's training from now on.<eos> As you wish, master.
It was Abdul!<eos> It was... It was something personal.<eos> You know how these hajis are, man.<eos> Please.<eos> My f'ing leg, man.<eos> - Where's your medic?<eos> - Why'd you run, then?<eos> I was scared.<eos> Your guys went all Geronimo in there.<eos> You saw what he did.
I can see two of three coming true.<eos> Who are you?<eos> That's Chase.<eos> Take the empty cage.<eos> - Hey. - Are you sure about that, Bear?<eos> It didn't end so good for the last guy.<eos> Or the one before.<eos> - Something about a Claymore.<eos> - And a dolphin.<eos> So, this is the new-guy scene where you give me shit, right?
I'll make sure the new guy's ready to roll.<eos> But that's it.<eos> I'm gone.<eos> Hey, Buckley, let's get this party started.<eos> What is going on here?<eos> The groundbreaking for your new school.<eos> SymcoPetro wants to give back, not just with job-creating economic investments, but here, with the future.<eos> I was very clear when I accepted your offer, and I am grateful. Thank you.<eos> But there was to be no publicity.<eos> It is dangerous for you to be here.

Yeah, that's a...<eos> You got a great memory, Chuck.<eos> That red bill and everything.<eos> What was the name of that little girl that lived, uh, three houses up from us?<eos> - She had, like, a pageboy haircut.<eos> - Jimmy. And she was always in the dirt, always dirty.<eos> - Jimmy! Jimmy! - I liked her.<eos> Don't think I'll ever forget what happened here today.<eos> And you will pay.<eos> You didn't mention my garden.
Jimmy McGill. Hey, Jimmy.<eos> We are almost done here.<eos> - Great.<eos> Can I, uh... - We're almost done. I'll be with you in a minute.<eos> Oh.<eos> And mention my lily pond. It's in my garden.<eos> Lily pond.<eos> Okay, ladies.<eos> Thanks so much for your help. Oh, you're very welcome.<eos> Thank you both for being so patient. And, Mrs. Aherne, if you or Margaret ever need anything from me... anything at all... you can call me day or night.

Hey, who was hurt, huh?<eos> What was damaged?<eos> The... the base is still there, right?<eos> The B-52 is, I presume, still...<eos> - B-29.<eos> - Huh?<eos> B-29. FIFI's a B-29.<eos> I don't... Oh, this is all just one big joke to you, huh?<eos> - You don't like the commercial.
- You don't like the commercial.<eos> - No, no, I don't, but this has nothing to do with the comm...<eos> Well, constructive criticism is always welcome.<eos> - But I didn't... - But you should realize that most people find it uplifting...<eos> - ... patriotic, even.<eos> - No. - You check your recruiting numbers. - I-I-I...<eos> I think you're gonna see an uptick, and you know what? If it turns out that Fudge wasn't actually in the war...<eos> Fudge is not a person. He wasn't in the war.<eos> Well, neither was Tom Cruise, and look what "Top Gun" did for you.<eos> You lied to me, you lied to my face, and I can't let you get away with it.

You're gonna take that ad off the air.<eos> And if you play that ad one more time,<eos> I'm gonna go to the Judge Advocate, and we will take you down... trespassing, false representation, stolen valor... the whole nine yards.<eos> Seriously, for eight seconds of a TV commercial?<eos> You take that ad down, or there'll be hell to pay.<eos> That clear enough for you?<eos> Make me.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Make you? - Yeah, let's do this. You bring your commander down here, and I'll explain to him how you let us on the base, red-carpet treatment.<eos> No, b-because you lied your way in.

Does that sound good?

Does that sound good?<eos> You know, guys like you... you think you're so damn smart, and you think you don't have to play straight with anybody.<eos> The wheel is gonna turn.<eos> It always does.<eos> "A lawyer you can trust." My ass!<eos> Thank you for your service!<eos> 3:30 in the morning?<eos> Seriously?<eos> You get me that?
How much?<eos> What do I look like...<eos> RadioShack? It's gonna cost you whatever it costs me, plus my end.<eos> Well, let's start with that.<eos> Normally, be about $500, but seeing that this is an after-hours house call, let's make it a grand.<eos> Hey, how's the pup?<eos> Doing okay?<eos> Yeah. She's not being left alone all day, is she?<eos> - She's got plenty of company.<eos> Hey, uh, this is gonna take me a few days, so I'll let you know.
Um, did you get the, uh...<eos> Yeah. I got them.<eos> I went ahead and, um...<eos> I figured I should maybe... I wrapped them up... you know, for safety.<eos> That's very thoughtful of you, but I need them now, so, if you...<eos> - You sure it's okay?<eos> - It's okay.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Shit!<eos> Ernesto, could you come in here, please?
Shit!<eos> Ernesto, could you come in here, please?<eos> Thought I could do this myself.<eos> Uh, would you mind, uh, changing the batteries?<eos> - Sure thing, Mr. McGill.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I changed 1261 to 1216.<eos> - It was me. - Turn that off! - Turn it off!<eos> - It all went down... - Turn it off! - ... exactly...<eos> Aah! You did not hear that!

Come quickly, or we'll all be dead!<eos> - Who's that contact again?<eos> - A woman named Sheba.<eos> Michael's caught in the middle of something big.<eos> Kaniel Outis is<eos> - a big-time terrorist.<eos> - We've arranged a visit to Ogygia Prison.<eos> That mean Michael's in there?<eos> Michael?<eos> My name isn't Michael, and I don't know who you are.
Whip, get up here.<eos> Is it happening?<eos> You are not going to leave us, are you?<eos> - If the rebels take the city, we're dead.<eos> - You've told us that a thousand times, Sid.<eos> You're a broken record.<eos> Is it clear?<eos> Okay, it's clear.<eos> Whip. Come on.<eos> Lights go out... you follow.
I want to stay with you.<eos> You got to go to school.<eos> And I'm gonna be right here when the bell rings.<eos> Okay? You walk down those steps, you hop straight into the car. Yeah?<eos> I love you.<eos> Make it a great day.<eos> I got the note.<eos> I got the note, Michael.<eos> We're going to get you out of here.<eos> Look, my name isn't Michael, and I don't know who you are.
Love you.<eos> Love you, too.<eos> Okay, no problem.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hi. I, uh, I called earlier about a missing U.S. citizen<eos> - in the Middle East.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm Henry Kishida.<eos> Let me walk you to the director's office.<eos> It's an unusual situation, which you can appreciate, since your husband is declared legally dead, and the person that you're referring to goes by another name.

When your call came in and Kishida processed it... well, let's just say there are certain keywords that get our system buzzing pretty quickly.<eos> Kaniel Outis...<eos> Actually, can't stand it watching you drink out of that.

When your call came in and Kishida processed it... well, let's just say there are certain keywords that get our system buzzing pretty quickly.<eos> Kaniel Outis...<eos> Actually, can't stand it watching you drink out of that.<eos> Hey, Kishida?<eos> Could you bring Sara a glass for her water, please?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Kaniel Outis... is a known terrorist, ties to ISIL, wanted in the killing of a senior CIA official.<eos> - Michael's no killer.<eos> - You see, that's the problem.
The record here at State says - that... that's Kaniel Outis's face.<eos> - Okay, but you and I both know who Michael Scofield was.<eos> No, that's just a memory.<eos> The official record... history...<eos> It says otherwise now.<eos> Now, that's scary, to think who could be behind that.<eos> Because only somebody very formidable would be capable of officially turning one man into another.<eos> It would take a genius...<eos> like Michael.<eos> You're insinuating that he did this?

Director of Electrical Works in Sana'a.<eos> Director of Electrical Works.<eos> "Sheik of Light."<eos> _<eos> Thanks for taking the time to see us.<eos> Where is everybody?<eos> They are fleeing ahead of the advance.<eos> We have been trying to reach him.<eos> All we know is that he went to the suburbs to try to find his daughter.<eos> Do you have an address for her?

All we know is that he went to the suburbs to try to find his daughter.<eos> Do you have an address for her?<eos> We tried calling her, but no answer.<eos> Address is here.<eos> You are not going to try to find him, are you?<eos> God be with you, then.<eos> Circled the address.<eos> Good luck.<eos> You're coming with us.<eos> If you think I'm going into the suburbs, you're crazy.
The front line of the war.<eos> Nice knowing you, Benjamin.<eos> I hope next time it's under better circumstances.<eos> - Pay up.<eos> - You have to get us past the checkpoint.<eos> Two Americans... we'll never make it without you.<eos> I am not getting myself killed.<eos> Pay up.<eos> Deliver the sheik.<eos> Then you get your money.
And the killer... well, you can see, it's who we call Michael Scofield,<eos> - or Kaniel Outis, or...<eos> - This is exactly what they did to Lincoln.<eos> And then there's the blood evidence the next day.<eos> Kaniel or Michael or whatever gets on a flight to Yemen.<eos> We all most nail him when he lands.<eos> He gets away.<eos> His luggage doesn't and Gaines' blood is all over the clothes inside.<eos> The evidence is overwhelming.<eos> Whatever name you want to call him,
Son of a bitch.<eos> Anything easy in this country?<eos> The question is: is the sheik even inside?<eos> Only one way to find out.<eos> They find us up here, there's no explaining ourselves.<eos> We're all dead.<eos> Quiet.<eos> You... You are not ISIL?<eos> No.<eos> But you're Mohammad El-Tunis, I take it?
Why?<eos> I want to order a pizza.<eos> There's a back door, toward the schoolhouse.<eos> Too late.<eos> Go to the rooftops.<eos> They're all over the Rover.<eos> - We'll never get to it.<eos> - I can get in that pickup, make a ruckus on my way out.<eos> Any luck, they'll be all over me.<eos> Then you got a clean shot to the Rover.

We have to stop.<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> Don't shoot at us!<eos> Don't shoot! Don't shoot!<eos> Stay down!<eos> Forgive me, uh...<eos> Their parents have been killed.<eos> I'm trying to figure out how I can help them.<eos> They can stay here for now.<eos> As long as you tell me who you know in Ogygia, and why they want you so bad.
They're beautiful.<eos> But perhaps too modern for this country.<eos> My daughter tries to educate girls.<eos> And my son, he falls in love with another man.<eos> They gave him 20 years in Ogygia Prison.<eos> I went to visit him a few weeks ago.<eos> He said, maybe there is a way out.<eos> A way I could help.<eos> A man is not a man if he would let his family die.<eos> You agreed to help him.
He said, maybe there is a way out.<eos> A way I could help.<eos> A man is not a man if he would let his family die.<eos> You agreed to help him.<eos> How?<eos> He said if I could arrange a blackout, he... he knew someone who could get him out.<eos> An American?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I-I was supposed to do this a week ago, but then this happened with my daughter.<eos> Thank God you found us.
If any of what they're saying is true...<eos> So there's more to find out, Sara.<eos> I mean, the important thing is that you are gonna survive this, however it turns out.<eos> And we're here for you. Okay?<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Call me, okay?<eos> Hey, can I just scoop Mike real quick?<eos> All the kids have been released.<eos> You don't have him?
Friends in high places, Bagwell. I can equip you with a fully articulate prosthetic.<eos> - Who's behind this?<eos> - Nobody.<eos> - This is Kaniel Outis.<eos> - Okay, but you and I both know<eos> - who Michael Scofield was. - We've awoken something, something people are trying to hide about Michael.<eos> Jacob?<eos> That's game theory.<eos> You meet people. You bring them into your life until the moment you need to manipulate the relationship to your advantage.<eos> You agreed to help him... how?
I know he has. You were in the cell with him.<eos> You. You tell me, so I can help you, before he uses you to get that devil out and we are all left here to die.<eos> We need passports, Omar.<eos> You think you can help us?<eos> Hold on. We're gonna trust this guy?<eos> He's the one who stole my passport in the first place.<eos> It was honest bargaining, friend.<eos> I took nothing.<eos> Besides, your passport is long gone, somewhere far overseas by now, I bet.<eos> If you want, um, I can have the forgers make you another.

I need two passports. One for me, one for my brother, Michael Scofield.<eos> $1,000 U.S. each, deposit.<eos> $1,000 U.S. when you pick them up.<eos> You screw with me and I'll kill you.<eos> I screw you,<eos> I won't be around for you to kill me.<eos> 11:00 tonight, Sheba.<eos> Passports will be ready.<eos> That means we're gonna have to split up.<eos> You two get the passports, and I'll go with our friend here to the power plant and kill the lights.

You, um... you fix phones, too, right?

You, um... you fix phones, too, right?<eos> Yeah. I think somebody hacked my cell.<eos> Whoa. Is there any chance you can help me figure out who?
What do you need a Korean junkie<eos> - like me for? - Korean genius, you mean.<eos> Getting over that wall is just the start.<eos> Once that happens, there are things only you can do.<eos> Back on point: you hit me.<eos> You wanted proof that I sided with you and not Ramal.<eos> - And splitting my lip does that how?<eos> - Son of a bitch Kaniel Outis keeps playing, doesn't he?<eos> Where is my watch?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.
You did not wait.<eos> You tried to rape me!<eos> Please. Please untie me... so I can take your other eye.<eos> Afternoon.<eos> I'm looking for a cell phone that a woman stole from me.<eos> She looks like this?<eos> No, can't help you.<eos> Can't... or won't?<eos> Sorry. Store policy, that's all.<eos> Hey, what are you doing?
Hey, Dad.<eos> Hey, Mom.<eos> Hi, son. Yeah, Sara,<eos> - let me, uh...<eos> - Thanks, sir.<eos> Oh, give me one sec.<eos> Hello? Hi.<eos> This is Brian at Jep's.<eos> I got this number when I activated your new phone.<eos> You never came back.
- Thanks, sir.<eos> Oh, give me one sec.<eos> Hello? Hi.<eos> This is Brian at Jep's.<eos> I got this number when I activated your new phone.<eos> You never came back.<eos> I'm sorry. I don't think I'm going to.<eos> Well, okay, I just want to let you know that<eos> I figured out who was hacking your phone. Who?<eos> You... hacked your own phone.
We go up through that hole, and then we skirt above the block.<eos> Goes right above Ramal's cell, doesn't it?<eos> Knock out a couple tiles, he joins the escape, doesn't he?<eos> What did you whisper to him in that moment after the fight?<eos> You whispered something, what was it?<eos> Nine minutes.<eos> How do you know?<eos> He told me at dinner.<eos> He said he would come for us.<eos> It's supposed to be only me, but you will all be coming.
Get up there, after him.<eos> Drop them!<eos> Drop them!<eos> Put it down!<eos> Do it!<eos> - No! - Down, now!<eos> - Board spans the gap.<eos> - Blanket covers the wire.<eos> Get out!<eos> What are you doing in this cell?
Previously on "How to Get Away with Murder"...<eos> Sam Keating went missing that night.<eos> His remains were found a few weeks later.<eos> Did you all do that?
Previously on "How to Get Away with Murder"...<eos> Sam Keating went missing that night.<eos> His remains were found a few weeks later.<eos> Did you all do that?<eos> Do you really want to know?<eos> I'm denying Ms. Keating's request for bail and ordering that she be remanded to Philadelphia County Prison.<eos> Dr. Bradfield of the Philadelphia Medical Examiner's Office has confirmed that Mr. Gibbins' cause of death is asphyxiation due to smoke inhalation.<eos> You said he died before the fire.

That's how much more I mean to her than you.<eos> I picked him up in my car, told him Annalise wanted to see him.<eos> He was nervous... I could tell.<eos> But then he got in.<eos> I took him to the house.<eos> When he saw she wasn't there, he got scared, tried to leave, so I knocked him out.<eos> Chloroform.<eos> Keating. On your feet.<eos> I said, "On your feet"!<eos> Where are you taking her?

Let's say we do believe you.<eos> Why kill him?<eos> Laurel.<eos> She left me for him.<eos> I tried to be okay with it, but...<eos> I lost it when I found out she was pregnant.<eos> On the gate!<eos> - Where's my lawyer?<eos> - Quiet.<eos> You're violating my Sixth Amendment right to counsel.

She was in the house when it exploded...<eos> She wasn't supposed to be.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> I can't take that I hurt her.<eos> I don't talk till I see Bonnie.<eos> - She didn't answer her phone.<eos> - It's the middle of the night.<eos> And this is urgent.<eos> Let's talk about Frank Delfino.<eos> You were Delfino's lawyer, right?

Frank!<eos> No.<eos> Get him out of here.<eos> I killed Wes.<eos> Tell Annalise I'm sorry!<eos> Please!<eos> Tell her I'm sorry!<eos> Obviously, this is a difficult time.<eos> I urge you to use the resources we have available...<eos> Talking to counselors, taking time off, whatever you need.
Thanks.<eos> That means a lot.<eos> Obviously, we have some outside attention because of Professor Keating's arrest...<eos> Police, journalists.<eos> So please know we are a resource if you need any guidance.<eos> He's a lawyer, right?<eos> Um, Mike Richardson, a trustee for the university.<eos> With all due respect, the whole "We're here for you" spiel loses its intended effect when you have legal counsel taking notes.<eos> It's university policy to have adequate record in situations like these.<eos> You mean situations where you need to protect the endowment.

Have you scheduled a memorial for him yet?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Because your immediate goal is to distance this university from Professor Keating.<eos> Michaela, we should just...<eos> Let me remind you that the most basic legal tenet is innocence until proven guilty.<eos> That applies to Professor Keating, who... let's be clear...<eos> Is being framed for a crime she didn't commit.<eos> Yet this office still hasn't released a statement of support for her, which I understand from a covering-your-ass point of view, but not from a looking-to-the-future one.<eos> Professor Keating is Middleton Law.<eos> She is a brilliant, empowering force of legal nature, and you should think long and hard before you hang her out to dry.
I trusted you to get me out on bail.<eos> Look how that went.<eos> Where did the car go after?<eos> Not sure, but we're checking all the security cameras.<eos> And you still haven't found Wes Gibbins' phone?<eos> No, so we're screwed.<eos> We're on record that Keating acted alone.<eos> I know, but that doesn't prove Delfino was involved.<eos> He's the last person to see our victim alive.<eos> You think any jury's gonna believe he didn't kill him?

No.<eos> I didn't even know.<eos> Which means he's lying.<eos> He's just trying to save Annalise, right?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'll call you back.<eos> Wait.<eos> You have another suspect who has confessed.<eos> A suspect who has every reason to do this at your client's bidding.<eos> If you don't believe him, why hold him?

A mountain of it...<eos> And it all points to Annalise Keating.<eos> Atwood's lying.<eos> They have evidence against Frank, and if I can find it, I can get Annalise released.<eos> You're tired.
- She didn't.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Frank did.<eos> He's just taking the fall.<eos> - You would believe that.<eos> - Listen!<eos> Annalise is a mess.<eos> She is losing it in there, and...<eos> I'm scared... more than I should admit to you.<eos> So I need your help, and so does she, and maybe you hate that...
Let me talk to Frank.<eos> - No.<eos> - I know the guy.<eos> And I'm damn good at my job.<eos> You're sure you don't want a lawyer?<eos> I waive my rights.<eos> Let's just get this over with so you can charge me.<eos> See, I'm not sure that's gonna happen.<eos> I confessed.<eos> You got me on candid camera.

You're lying for Annalise.<eos> And I understand why.<eos> She's controlled you for quite a long time.<eos> Y'all have got 15 minutes!<eos> Yeah, yeah. I heard you.<eos> Shoot.<eos> Come on. Over here.<eos> Put your stuff there.<eos> Push to the front, get in, get out.<eos> You were just a sad, angry criminal.

Dumbass burnt down her own big-ass crib, too.<eos> Guess lawyers ain't as smart as we thought.<eos> Look at her running scared.<eos> You're lying for her.<eos> That camera shows Wes got in your car at 4:24 p.m., but the house didn't explode until a few hours later.<eos> What happened in between?<eos> I'm done.<eos> Seriously.<eos> Release me, call a public defender to get you off my back, but I'm done being interrogated.<eos> You hear me?
The only thing they like smelling more than a man in here is fear.<eos> Take it!<eos> Visitor.<eos> - I'm not who you were expecting. - No.<eos> I'm sorry if this is a shock.<eos> It's just... I had a meeting with your students this morning.<eos> What?<eos> It's just protocol.<eos> Honestly.<eos> Still, talking with them, hearing how important you are to them...

So did you, in your... confession.<eos> You screwed up with Annalise.<eos> She told me that while you were away.<eos> So this is your way of fixing things.<eos> Not everything's about Annalise.<eos> Did Frank kill Rebecca?<eos> BonBon, please don't lie to us.<eos> Why would I lie to you right now?<eos> Are you being serious?<eos> I don't know anything that you don't know.
Meggy's acting sketchy.<eos> She keeps visiting me.<eos> She brought me jello.<eos> Isn't that just nice?<eos> Nice... or sketchy.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> How could we all be so stupid?<eos> We have information relating to various investigations.<eos> In exchange, we'd like an immunity deal for all charges against Ms. Keating.<eos> You mean a "Get out of jail free" card for crimes orchestrated by your client.

Of course not.<eos> We came here to negotiate in good faith.<eos> You mean to leverage bodies for leniency.<eos> I'm sure the state is as interested as we are in bringing closure to the families of these unsolved cases.<eos> To be clear, these are unsolved murder cases.<eos> We've told you everything we're willing to tell you without a deal.<eos> One of your own students.<eos> An orphan who fought his way through a difficult foster-care system to become something.<eos> Ms. Keating is clearly devastated by the loss of her student.<eos> You were his professor, and he trusted you.

Your husband is already passed and you can see that by the way that he follows you.<eos> You should let him go, poor soul.<eos> You torture him.<eos> There is enough treachery already surrounding us that there is no need for us to add to it.<eos> The arrival of letters at this address does not go unnoticed.<eos> My husband is harsh and is a Christian.<eos> I welcome it.<eos> I deserve it.<eos> Your husband is also a fool.<eos> He cannot see all that you are.
And she likes it.<eos> Since you came back, our fucking has become almost murderous.<eos> It exhausts us.<eos> To think I have this wicked... wicked thing beneath me and it's my lifelong duty to punish her.<eos> It exhausts us both.<eos> A beautiful exhaustion.<eos> And in the morning I read the Gazette and she eats her toast... like a sweet little bird.<eos> I didn't come to sell you insurance, Mr. Delaney.<eos> I came to thank you.<eos> You summoned me.
As of now, you are a weakness.<eos> These fantasies elude me...<eos> If you go outside, they will find you and they will find a use for you.<eos> I am seldom used.<eos> There is no "they" and there will be a performance.<eos> Are you armed?<eos> Get me a carriage to Drury Lane, would you?<eos> You have to get that woman out of this house or I swear I will kill her and her bloody canary.<eos> Brace... get two carriages.<eos> I see that you're bleeding again.

I saw blood.<eos> How?<eos> Where?<eos> You searching the laundry?<eos> It is equally my business.<eos> It seems that jointly we are unable to stop the moon from rising.<eos> Could you fetch some oranges?<eos> I would like some oranges.<eos> Is it the goose or the gander who has bad sauce?<eos> Do you know we can't even afford new china?
Could you fetch some oranges?<eos> I would like some oranges.<eos> Is it the goose or the gander who has bad sauce?<eos> Do you know we can't even afford new china?<eos> So that's your reason for not taking.<eos> The dock boys I pay in pennies have litters of children.<eos> I just get blood.<eos> My dearest Zilpha...<eos> I apologise... that I am not related to you.<eos> But you could allow your cunt to swallow the work of an honest man, who will promise to buy you the finest china... if you just agree to stop fucking bleeding.

These giant multinational corporations are filled with monstrous vermin, poisonous, vile murderers, and they eat, drink, and shit money.<eos> They buy our politicians for a song.<eos> Then these fucking politicians sing as we gag and cough, sold down the river to die.<eos> Fuck you who betray the people you were elected to help, elected to work to help to make life better for.<eos> Fuck you all in the ass, you fucking treasonous puppets!<eos> The ninth level of hell will welcome you.<eos> Okay, I'm tired of waiting for the phone to ring.<eos> I'm going to the Roadhouse.<eos> I know he couldn't stand that place, but we've checked everywhere else.<eos> Are you coming with me?

Uh, I don't know, Audrey.<eos> Those papers... there's something fishy about them. I'm not signing anything until I run them by my lawyer.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> Maybe I should run them by Paul.<eos> Maybe I should have Paul come give you a visit.<eos> Don't, Audrey.<eos> Don't be like this.<eos> I'm your lawfully wedded husband.<eos> I have rights.<eos> You gave up those rights.
Oh, I see.<eos> Maybe I should run them by Paul.<eos> Maybe I should have Paul come give you a visit.<eos> Don't, Audrey.<eos> Don't be like this.<eos> I'm your lawfully wedded husband.<eos> I have rights.<eos> You gave up those rights.<eos> What?<eos> You mean you'd go back on our contract?
Okay, Audrey.<eos> I'll go with you.<eos> I'm so sleepy, but I'll go.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> We're going to the Roadhouse.<eos> I told you.<eos> Oh, Audrey.<eos> I'll go, then.<eos> I'll need my jacket.<eos> I see you've already got yours.

Okay, it's gonna be a fun day.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Thanks for coming so early.<eos> - Yeah, of course.<eos> She doesn't know you're here, right?<eos> No.<eos> I hate lying to her.<eos> Yeah, but she'll find out the truth soon enough.<eos> You know, it's, it's important to me.

Just knowing that Emily's gonna be taken care of.<eos> Like I promised you<eos> I will always be here for her.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, I was thinking about staying in town for a while.<eos> Really?<eos> That's great.<eos> I feel like we're just starting to get to know each other again.<eos> Me too.<eos> But I was hoping you'd consider swapping the barn for your old room?

I feel like we're just starting to get to know each other again.<eos> Me too.<eos> But I was hoping you'd consider swapping the barn for your old room?<eos> Fine.<eos> You win.<eos> But just this once.<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Toby.<eos> What are you doing here?
But I was hoping you'd consider swapping the barn for your old room?<eos> Fine.<eos> You win.<eos> But just this once.<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Toby.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Ali said she talked to Jason.<eos> You weren't coming back for the wedding.
Can I help you?<eos> Toby.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Ali said she talked to Jason.<eos> You weren't coming back for the wedding.<eos> Yeah, I mean, I wasn't planning on it, but we finished the well in Karambe ahead of schedule and I...<eos> Decided to hike back from Africa?<eos> I didn't know if I was ready to come back so I flew to New York and I just, I started walking.<eos> Wasn't sure where I'd end up.<eos> How are you doing?
But be careful though, so far I'm the only person he's trusted enough to get close to.<eos> That's a first.<eos> Easy.<eos> Easy.<eos> It's alright.<eos> It's alright, it's alright.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Shh. It's okay.<eos> Um, hey, if you, give me a minute<eos> I can give you a lift back into town, if you want?
Easy.<eos> Easy.<eos> It's alright.<eos> It's alright, it's alright.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Shh. It's okay.<eos> Um, hey, if you, give me a minute<eos> I can give you a lift back into town, if you want?<eos> What can I help you with?<eos> Can you throw that in the truck?
It's okay.<eos> Shh. It's okay.<eos> Um, hey, if you, give me a minute<eos> I can give you a lift back into town, if you want?<eos> What can I help you with?<eos> Can you throw that in the truck?<eos> Yeah. I saw it on eBay and I couldn't resist.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good boy.<eos> Orson Welles said that if you want a happy ending that depends, of course, on where you stop your story.

It's like when you finish a book and you don't want it to end.<eos> Even though the characters are happy you're still sad that it's ending.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Isn't your friend the reason the book doesn't have a happy ending?<eos> She stole Ezra from Nicole.<eos> They were hooking up while she was rotting away...<eos> That's enough, Addison.<eos> It's just my opinion.<eos> - Lesbo.<eos> - Excuse me, what did you say?

I'm just late for class.<eos> Addison, is that you?<eos> You should get to class.
I'm fine. I'm just late for class.<eos> Addison, is that you?<eos> You should get to class.<eos> That was the last bell.<eos> Some of us can see... and hear.<eos> So go.<eos> Now.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> I may not be able to see but I can smell a bitch from a mile away.<eos> And I thought you used to be the mean girl.

It's just until she finishes therapy.<eos> And how long is that gonna be?<eos> It's Welby.<eos> They just dropped off Mona.<eos> - She's on her way up.<eos> - We were doing so well, Hanna.<eos> With your designs taking off and me selling my software to Lucas.<eos> We bought the loft.<eos> I'm gonna get ready for the party.<eos> You're not even going to say hello?
I thought maybe you changed your mind.<eos> No.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> So... how do you feel about Thai takeout for dinner?<eos> Mona, we have the bachelorbachelorette party tonight.<eos> - I told you.<eos> Remember?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Um, with the meds, I'm not as sharp as I used to be.<eos> You're getting better, Mona.
No.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> So... how do you feel about Thai takeout for dinner?<eos> Mona, we have the bachelorbachelorette party tonight.<eos> - I told you.<eos> Remember?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Um, with the meds, I'm not as sharp as I used to be.<eos> You're getting better, Mona.<eos> Yeah, you know, I'll be fine by myself.

I would have never known this was the Lost Woods Resort.<eos> Spencer researched the history and philosophy of all the great camps in the Adirondacks.<eos> Of course, you did.

- My vote got shot down.<eos> Well, since we can't go with you on your honeymoon...<eos> 'Cause that would be weird.<eos> We thought we'd spent a night in Provence with you guys.<eos> We're just jealous that you're going to France and we're not.<eos> This Italian city off the coast of Venice is known for its glassmaking.<eos> - Murano?<eos> - Yes!<eos> My God!<eos> So are you nervous?
- Thanks.<eos> - I could use your help.<eos> How many people does it take to make mojito?<eos> Two.<eos> What's going on?<eos> You and Caleb are sitting so far apart that you could be in different time zones.<eos> Mona's living with us.<eos> I'm her sponsor.<eos> - What?<eos> Why would you do that?
Mona's living with us.<eos> I'm her sponsor.<eos> - What?<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> - She doesn't have anyone else.<eos> I'm not trying to take Caleb's side here, but...<eos> Then don't.<eos> I'm the one who made her play the game.<eos> I shouldn't have done that.<eos> Hanna, do you know the Greek myth about the girl who tried to escape from hell?
Goodnight.<eos> - Subtle.<eos> - Wow.<eos> Babe, we should go too.<eos> Call it a night too.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> You tired?<eos> No, not really.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> You're partner at your mother's law firm... As a paralegal.

How many points is squeegee?<eos> You don't even wanna know.<eos> No.<eos> You seem good.<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> Melissa and I are finally getting along and my mom and I are so close.<eos> And it's real, and it's solid and...<eos> I never knew how badly I wanted that until I had it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's the leaves of a shrub that you chew like tobacco.

Can we not do this right now?<eos> You're stressing me out and it's bad for my body.<eos> We need to talk about this.<eos> Well, can it wait half hour?<eos> I'm trying to get pregnant.<eos> That is exactly why we need to talk about this.<eos> Fine.<eos> Talk.<eos> But, can you do it at a low volume?<eos> You're scaring my ovaries.
But, can you do it at a low volume?<eos> You're scaring my ovaries.<eos> Hanna, I'm a passenger in our marriage.<eos> - That is not true.<eos> - Well, it feels like it.<eos> With Sylvia Plath as our new roommate and even my sex drive is dictated by your ovulation app.<eos> Hold on, Mona and "Trying to have a baby"<eos> are two very different things.<eos> Maybe they're not.<eos> I mean, if you don't care how I feel about one then maybe you're not ready to do the other.

I can't do that.<eos> Our rehearsal dinner's tomorrow.<eos> Are you sure you wanna go through a ceremony holding on to something like that?<eos> This isn't up for debate.<eos> But Aria is hiding this from him.<eos> We'd be crazy not to use it.<eos> - It's not part of my plan.<eos> - Well, I don't know your plan.<eos> I'm in the dark.<eos> I mean, you asked me to put on the Melissa mask and then you don't even want me to use it.

I got confirmation yesterday.<eos> - Confirmation?<eos> - I was late.<eos> II thought I was pregnant.<eos> - Aria...<eos> - I can't have kids.<eos> It's alright.<eos> Great.<eos> She skipped out on you.<eos> - Caleb, who are you calling?
Great.<eos> She skipped out on you.<eos> - Caleb, who are you calling?<eos> - The cops.<eos> I told you this would happen.<eos> How was the party?<eos> - Didn't you hear us?<eos> - No.<eos> I was in the shower.<eos> Did you need something?

I ate.<eos> I've missed you, sweetheart.<eos> It's been weeks since your last visit.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I missed you, too, mom.<eos> We're gonna get through this.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Tomorrow's supposed to be one of the happiest days of our lives.<eos> It will be.<eos> You still plannin' on marrying' me tomorrow, right?

Peter's mother was pretentious like that.<eos> Ate a slice of pizza with a knife and fork.<eos> I eat pizza with a knife and fork.<eos> When I told Dianne that we weren't members of the Country Club, she looked at me like I spit out a tooth.<eos> Your fingers don't get greasy and the cheese doesn't slide out.<eos> Sometimes I wish we were still in the basement.<eos> At least then we had some peace and quiet.<eos> My God.<eos> You remember how we got out of there?<eos> You know, Pam didn't drink for a year after that.

Well, can I talk to you, ladies?<eos> - We're working. - Okay.<eos> Well, you can tell your boss we're talkin' about Rumaki spheres.<eos> Look, Willa, I've known you since you volunteered at the Y.
Look, Willa, I've known you since you volunteered at the Y.<eos> And, Hadley, I know it's hard being the new girl at school but you still have a choice in who you make friends with.<eos> Is this about Addison?<eos> Because she is nice to me.<eos> And I don't wanna be on the other side of that.<eos> Your aunt had a real confidence to her and that's what I loved.<eos> Maya was kind.<eos> She picked me.<eos> It wasn't the other way around.<eos> And you don't say no to someone like Addison.

You did?<eos> Kind of unrequited love.<eos> Thank you for driving, sweetheart.<eos> - Yeah. - We have to...<eos> We have to make a couple of extra stops.<eos> - Hey. - I call shotgun.<eos> Watch it.<eos> I know it's none of my business, but... don't take for granted the people who love you the most just because they sometimes let you.<eos> What does that even mean?<eos> You're my daughter and I will always be on your side.

But I'm still on your side.<eos> Marin, will you get in the car?<eos> - Love you.<eos> - Love you, mom.<eos> Pile in.<eos> It's finally happening.<eos> This is a little surreal.<eos> I know.<eos> We're actually getting married.<eos> It would be really encouraging for me if every time we bring up the topic of our wedding you don't look like you're about to burst into tears.
We have options.<eos> I remember a friend of the family.<eos> She's a fertility specialist.<eos> After this weekend's done, we'll go to her.<eos> We'll get a second opinion...<eos> This was a second opinion.<eos> In fact, it was the third opinion.<eos> I went to two other doctors and they said the same thing.<eos> They did?<eos> How, how long have you known?

Come upstairs, let's talk.<eos> No, I...<eos> I think what I need is sleep.<eos> We're gonna be okay.<eos> I just wish that you had as much faith in me as I have in you.
No, I...<eos> I think what I need is sleep.<eos> We're gonna be okay.<eos> I just wish that you had as much faith in me as I have in you.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you too.<eos> But it's not really the same thing, is it?<eos> What, are they still sleeping?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You've barely said two words to me all night.

I mean, it was pretty loud in there.<eos> She put something in your purse.<eos> What was it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Breath mints?<eos> I mean, your mom's pretty passive aggressive and there were onions on those sliders.<eos> My mom avoided me all night.<eos> - What is going on?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Ali, we're not going to sleep until you tell me what's in that purse.

Tender, juicy, and bursting with flavor.<eos> The secret is cooking at a high...<eos> Hey, you're awake?<eos> Yeah, I'm not tired.<eos> - What are you watching?<eos> - I can't tell.<eos> It's either a really bad comedy about chefs or a really good infomercial about deep fryers.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> I don't know what else to say, Hanna.<eos> The decisions you make don't just affect you.

Mary?<eos> Sweet dreams.<eos> I really need your discretion on this.<eos> Clearly, it was very last minute.<eos> Um, so if you could just keep it quiet?<eos> Yeah, thank you.<eos> - Ezra.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - What are you doing here?
What do you mean she escaped?<eos> We don't have the details, but we'll stay in constant touch with the state police.<eos> And if Mary Drake does try to reach out to you...<eos> This has to be a joke.<eos> Right?<eos> I mean, our friend's getting married today.<eos> This can't be happening.<eos> Officer Maple, if she does try and contact us.<eos> II promise we'll let you know immediately.<eos> You should know she's probably not alone.

I was in shock.<eos> And I had a list of questions about a mile long.<eos> It took Wren days to tell me everything he knew.<eos> I've never felt so close to someone so fast.<eos> And he felt the same way.<eos> Melissa was already out of the picture.<eos> She was dating some composer.<eos> So he was fair game.<eos> I guess you could say he has a type.<eos> You know, first her, then you, then her, then me.

I wanted it on my own terms.<eos> Wren let me come to Rosewood alone 'cause he knew that I would come back to him.<eos> And after I found out who killed Charlotte that's just what I did.<eos> Yet here you are.<eos> Now I know this isn't fun for you but it's very exciting for me.<eos> You see, I've been dying to meet you.<eos> Yeah, well, you could've just called.<eos> That is such a classic Spencer line.<eos> I'll be sure to use it.<eos> If I'm in here because you're pretending to be me my friends are gonna figure it out.

- You've got this.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> - I think I'm dying here.<eos> - No, I won't let that happen.<eos> Toby, can I kiss you?<eos> Just one last time.<eos> Just to say goodbye.<eos> Like mother, like daughter.<eos> That's what you and Mary were arguing about.<eos> She pretended to be Jessica to sleep with my father and now you're pretending to be me to sleep with Toby?

I'm honoring her.<eos> Don't you get that?<eos> I get everything about you.<eos> And I miss you.<eos> I miss us.<eos> Ezra!<eos> God.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I don't think you've ever met Wren Kingston.
I don't think you've ever met Wren Kingston.<eos> Ezra, this is Wren.<eos> Wren, this is Ezra Fitz.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Pleasure.<eos> I made good on my promise to Wren that night.<eos> And when the game was over, I went back to London.<eos> But I just...<eos> I couldn't stop thinkin' about you.<eos> About how good you have it.

Isn't that enough?<eos> This isn't about money, okay?<eos> This is about having a home and parents and friends who risk their lives for each other.<eos> Even when they make mistakes even when they make huge mistakes they still love each other.<eos> I just...<eos> Please, I want to know what that feels like.<eos> - So you tell them the truth.<eos> - Come on.<eos> And when they hear your story, they'll understand.<eos> You're joking, right?

With Wren.<eos> But no matter what, he always thought of me as Alex and I just, I didn't wanna be her anymore.<eos> So you, you broke up with him?<eos> No.<eos> No, I can never do that.<eos> But he is always close by.<eos> I turned his ashes into an eternity stone.<eos> Because diamonds last forever.<eos> Sorry, I've got to go get ready.<eos> Um, hey, how are you planning on wearing your hair for the wedding?
Bye.<eos> That was the state police.<eos> Still no leads on Mary.<eos> How could that happen?<eos> Look, somebody had to have helped her.<eos> Well, my mom hired extra security for today, so I don't think that we should be telling Aria until after the wedding.<eos> Yeah. I agree.<eos> - Well...<eos> - Hashtag Aria's wedding dress.<eos> Em, are you crying?

I'm just...<eos> I'm so happy to be here with all of you.<eos> Celebrating you, Aria.<eos> Well, I couldn't have imagined this day without you guys.<eos> Let's take a selfie before the photographer gets here.<eos> Sorry, girls.<eos> She's a little muzzy, so I thought I'd bring her in to see mommies.<eos> - May I?<eos> - Yeah, of course.<eos> Aria, you look so beautiful.

I'm a wanted convict for Archie Dunhill's murder.<eos> A crime I didn't commit, remember?<eos> I took the blame for you and your friends so I think I deserve a little trust.<eos> I thought we could have lunch together.<eos> I took a lover in Peru who owned a little restaurant that made the most exquisite saltado de pollo.<eos> I'm the only person he ever shared the recipe with.<eos> So where are we?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She gave me something to sleep and the next thing I knew, I woke up here.<eos> But you're safe, Spencer.

I thought she would live a Cinderella life.<eos> Have you read "Grimm's Fairy Tales?"<eos> The irony hasn't been wasted on me.<eos> Apparently, Alex had some issues.<eos> And when she was still young enough to forget them her parents left her at an orphanage.<eos> They couldn't risk tarnishing their names so they, they even took that back and she was given her birth name.<eos> Alex Drake.<eos> She ran away from the Ambrose Home for wayward children on her tenth birthday.<eos> A year before I found out she was there.<eos> Can you imagine how alone she must have felt?

No.<eos> He let you down.<eos> And after we make sure that he's okay I'm going to wring his neck.<eos> - Should we tell the guests?<eos> - No.<eos> Yes, I don't...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Should we?<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Aria, you should probably try calling him again.

- Ezra sent Aria a text.<eos> - He's not coming.<eos> Hey, can you hear me?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Ezra?<eos> I was making the reservation you suggested and when I thanked her for the information she seemed confused.<eos> Like she didn't know what I was talking about.<eos> So out of concern, I followed around and when I pressed her for answers, she just turned and just gave me this death stare.<eos> And that was the last thing that I remember.<eos> - Are you okay?
And we're locked in some sort of doityourself dungeon so no, I'm, I'm not okay.<eos> I meant your head.<eos> Sorry, sarcasm is my brain's selfdefense mechanism for whenever I'm about to be murdered.<eos> That was Spencer.<eos> She's gonna swing by the apartment and get you something to wear.<eos> My mom's sleeping over, so we're gonna stay with you, okay?<eos> Still no word?<eos> Hello, sister.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, you don't have to do this.

Stop.<eos> Look, we both understand why you became A.D.

Stop. Stop.<eos> Look, we both understand why you became A.D.<eos> You and I actually met once.<eos> Ezra?<eos> I don't think you've met Wren Kingston.<eos> Wren was almost my brotherinlaw a couple of times.<eos> Have a drink with us.<eos> No, stop, stop!<eos> Look, he's right.<eos> You don't have to do this.

Wren was almost my brotherinlaw a couple of times.<eos> Have a drink with us.<eos> No, stop, stop!<eos> Look, he's right.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Look, you became A.D. because of Charlotte.<eos> I understand that and my friends will too.<eos> Okay, they'll forgive you just like we forgave Mona.<eos> So what?<eos> This isn't just about you wanting my friends.
Okay, they'll forgive you just like we forgave Mona.<eos> So what?<eos> This isn't just about you wanting my friends.<eos> It's about Toby, isn't it?<eos> He settled for Yvonne.<eos> We both know that.<eos> And now he's free to be with his one true love.<eos> Me.<eos> So then what's gonna happen now?<eos> You can't just keep me here forever.
See, Charlotte left me everything.<eos> So Jenna wanted money?<eos> Well, she was desperate for one last chance to stay.<eos> She doesn't know who I am, but she offered to help me and I kept my promise.<eos> I paid for her surgery.<eos> She's still as blind as a bat and useless to me.<eos> What about Sara Harvey?<eos> Was she looking for you too?<eos> Well, Charlotte told Sara that she hid her greatest treasure in The Radley and Sara thought that she was talkin' about some pot of gold.<eos> But what she meant was that fall you found.

No, I do not.<eos> Charlotte Drake, I will be calling you.<eos> And I'm not going to wait three days.<eos> I'll ring you tomorrow.<eos> Enchante, mademoiselle.<eos> Au revoir.<eos> - Is she here?<eos> - Yeah, her plane just landed.<eos> She's waiting for you in the bar.<eos> And how do you know that she's my sister?
He adored her.<eos> So he was on the A team too?<eos> No, that stunt that he pulled with Alison?<eos> No, that was all him.<eos> He found Mary and convinced her it was what Charlotte would have wanted and it probably was.<eos> She loved him.<eos> Before she came back to Rosewood, the four of us<eos> Charlotte and Archer, Wren and me we did everything together.<eos> But Charlotte missed the game.<eos> Why are you giving them so much power over you?
But Charlotte missed the game.<eos> Why are you giving them so much power over you?<eos> I am the power.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> No. I don't.<eos> I won't be gone for long, I promise.<eos> Then let me come with you.<eos> Please, come on. I wanna meet her.<eos> No.<eos> You are to stay as far away from the Hastings as possible.

I'm gonna miss my flight.<eos> No, I'll drive you.<eos> It'll be too hard to say goodbye to you.<eos> I almost forgot.<eos> It's my favorite.<eos> I love you, Alex.<eos> I'll always take care of you.<eos> She never came back to London.<eos> And the next time I saw her, I was visiting her grave.<eos> Alex, why do you think she never wanted us to meet?

Story time's over.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> So I'm still alive because I'm your sister but what's gonna happen to Ezra?<eos> Well, he's not family, so...<eos> Enjoy his company while you can.<eos> I think that you and I are gonna be the closest of all.<eos> Hey, there.<eos> Hey.<eos> You know me, right?

You're okay.<eos> You're okay.<eos> Come on.<eos> Whoa. Easy.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, um, it's fine.<eos> He's just, he's just having a bit of a bad day.<eos> The best thing to do when he gets like this is just to walk away.<eos> Easy.<eos> I was wondering if you've seen Ezra.
Well, Ezra's booked us yesterday to take him and his wife up to kick off their honeymoon.<eos> When yesterday?<eos> Morning around, 10 o'clock through The Radley concierge.<eos> Why would Ezra book you on a hot air balloon ride if he wasn't planning on marrying you?<eos> Do you think it'll help because she needs to be stopped?<eos> If nothing else, just the threat of a civil case could be enough to force her parents to accept some responsibility for Addison's actions.<eos> Thank you, Veronica.<eos> - Everything okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you're just a rock star, that's all.

Yeah, you're just a rock star, that's all.<eos> Well, you've never called me that before, but I'll take it.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Thank you for setting this up, Spencer.<eos> Yeah, I hope we can help.<eos> Is that a new perfume you're wearing?<eos> It's called horse hair.<eos> I was at the stables this morning with Toby.<eos> Well, maybe you can convince him to stay for a while.
And someone with the motivation to be A.D.<eos> Okay, are we really saying that A.D. is back?<eos> Yeah, that she's Spencer's evil twin?<eos> That who's doing this to us?<eos> I mean, out of all the insane theories we've jumped to<eos> Spencer having an evil twin has got to be the most insane.<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> - My head is gonna explode.<eos> It's time for plan B.<eos> You need to tell me who you are and where you are.
- My head is gonna explode.<eos> It's time for plan B.<eos> You need to tell me who you are and where you are.<eos> - I won't let you do this.<eos> - Shut up, mom.<eos> - I'm begging you, please.<eos> - Come on, Spencer.<eos> Ezra, I have done this before.<eos> - I've got this. - Okay.<eos> Alex, you promised me that you wouldn't hurt her.
It'll be painless.<eos> We can leave now and still get away.<eos> Let's take a motherdaughter trip to Europe.<eos> No!<eos> I'm not going anywhere without Toby.<eos> Right, I see it in his eyes he's in love with me.<eos> He's in love with Spencer, not you.<eos> Well, I am Spencer now!<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I know what it's like to want something so badly that you start to believe that it's true.

I don't know, but we're about to find out.<eos> Anything?<eos> The only way out is back through there.<eos> No, no way I'm doin' that.<eos> Wait!<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> Please, I'm your sister, just like Charlotte.<eos> I'm your sister, just like Charlotte.<eos> I'm sorry that you got the wrong end of the deal.

Spencer.<eos> Don't listen to her!<eos> Look at me, you know me.
Yeah, it is.<eos> Drop it!<eos> Ezra!<eos> Toby, it's me. Spencer.<eos> Don't listen to her!<eos> Look at me, you know me.<eos> You guys, come on, seriously.<eos> After everything that we've been through.<eos> My God.<eos> You really do believe what you're saying.

Spencer.<eos> Don't listen to her!<eos> Look at me, you know me.<eos> You guys, come on, seriously.<eos> After everything that we've been through.<eos> My God.<eos> You really do believe what you're saying.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> Please.<eos> Tell me your favorite poem from the book you gave me?
Em, today you do.<eos> I, Ezra, take thee, Aria to have and to hold from this day forward... for better, for worse for richer, for poorer in sickness and in health to love and to cherish till death do us part.<eos> If anyone can show a just cause why this couple cannot lawfully be joined together in matrimony let them speak now or forever hold their peace.<eos> By the power vested in me<eos> I now pronounce you husband and wife.<eos> You may kiss the bride.<eos> I present you for the very first time.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Fitz.<eos> I was looking online and your first class seats are bigger than our bedroom.<eos> And you have to get the duck.
I now pronounce you husband and wife.<eos> You may kiss the bride.<eos> I present you for the very first time.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Fitz.<eos> I was looking online and your first class seats are bigger than our bedroom.<eos> And you have to get the duck.<eos> If they're flying it in from Peking, it has to be...<eos> Han, that's how the duck is prepared.<eos> It's not actually from Peking.<eos> Okay, you don't know that for sure, Spencer.
It's not actually from Peking.<eos> Okay, you don't know that for sure, Spencer.<eos> Yes, I do because Peking is now Beijing.<eos> Well, then they should call it Beijing duck.<eos> I'm gonna get the duck, Han.<eos> We heard Toby's sticking around.<eos> Yeah, um, Jason said that he's got that veteran's program in Philly.<eos> Yeah, if it works out, they should, um get a lot of homeless people off the streets.<eos> Yeah, and Toby is gonna keep climbing into your sheets.<eos> Sorry, are you already honeymoon drunk?
Yeah, if it works out, they should, um get a lot of homeless people off the streets.<eos> Yeah, and Toby is gonna keep climbing into your sheets.<eos> Sorry, are you already honeymoon drunk?<eos> - No! I'm, I'm happy for you.<eos> - We all are.<eos> I've always loved you two together.<eos> Is it actually possible that all of us are happy at the same time?<eos> My God, don't say that out loud, it's a jinx.<eos> Well, then I guess I can't say this other thing.<eos> Yes, you can.
Ah, America.<eos> You beacon of composure and proportionate response.<eos> You bringer of calm and goodness to the world.<eos> What do you do when the war you're fighting just can't possibly be won in any meaningful sense?
Ah, America.<eos> You beacon of composure and proportionate response.<eos> You bringer of calm and goodness to the world.<eos> What do you do when the war you're fighting just can't possibly be won in any meaningful sense?<eos> Well, obviously, you sack the guy not winning it, and you bring in some other guy.
Then fucking let him in just like you would any other fucking person with a fucking security clearance!<eos> His official title was director of intelligence, but all I saw was a guy with anger management issues whose life had no meaning without Glen.<eos> Andy Moon was Glen's tech whiz, providing the general with all forms of IT support.<eos> Andy.<eos> - Yes, sir? - Which Glen needed often.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Pretty good, sir.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> Swell.<eos> Can you come with me a moment?
Do I have that right?<eos> Courageous restraint.<eos> And that is right.<eos> Well, I don't mean to be rude, sir, but I do not understand what the fuck that means.<eos> It means, son, that sometimes when you're dealing with an insurgency, you're not gonna be 100% clear on who the enemy is.<eos> It means you're gonna find yourself in situations where, when you're afraid or whatnot, you're gonna have to make a judgment call.<eos> Because, as Sergeant Ortega here has so rightly pointed out, your mission is to protect the people, not kill them.<eos> We can't help them and kill them at the same time.<eos> It just ain't humanly possible.<eos> Do you understand me?
Walking!<eos> Walking! Walking here?<eos> Walking.<eos> I like to walk.<eos> Badi!<eos> Come in. Come in.<eos> Everyone, this is my new aide-de-camp, Badi Bassim.<eos> He's a soldier and a scholar.<eos> This is the face of the new Afghanistan.<eos> Greg, you know. That's Cory.
Everyone, this is my new aide-de-camp, Badi Bassim.<eos> He's a soldier and a scholar.<eos> This is the face of the new Afghanistan.<eos> Greg, you know. That's Cory.<eos> You know Cory.<eos> Pete Duckman.<eos> And... we got people here from Spain and Italy and...<eos> - You know, places like that.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Have you voted?
This is the face of the new Afghanistan.<eos> Greg, you know. That's Cory.<eos> You know Cory.<eos> Pete Duckman.<eos> And... we got people here from Spain and Italy and...<eos> - You know, places like that.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Have you voted?<eos> - I wanted to report to you first.<eos> - You haven't voted? - No.
We can't ignore these fraud allegations.<eos> They're coming in from every corner of the country and everything points to a ridiculous Karzai victory.<eos> I mean, the whole thing just smells stupid.<eos> Sure.<eos> Sure, there's gonna be irregularity now and again.<eos> But surely a result is the best possible outcome. Yeah?<eos> The polling station, the one right there over where you are... 367 registered voters, 1,200 votes counted.<eos> It's a joke.<eos> We're going to a runoff election.<eos> Tell them what you told me!
- that you leaked this report yourself.<eos> - I'm choosing to embrace the leak, Simon.<eos> I don't seem to be getting any traction. Do you know what I'm saying? Traction?<eos> We got ourselves a president who appears not to be aware of the fact that the United States is at war right now, and he's that war's commander in chief.<eos> - I gotta get me some traction.<eos> - You need cut through.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Cut through. You need to get me some goddamn cut through.<eos> I can handle that for you, sir.<eos> Sorry. No offense, Simon, how exactly are you gonna do that?

No offense, Simon, how exactly are you gonna do that?<eos> I'll quieten this whole situation down.<eos> Again, I'm sorry, I don't wanna start a fight here. And please forgive me for speaking for you, sir. But the general didn't hire me to make things quiet, okay?<eos> Look, you're so good at your job, but that job is basically writing press releases.
He's good.<eos> - He sends his love.<eos> - Okay.<eos> He's got a new girlfriend now.<eos> Yeah, I like her.<eos> Yeah, her daddy's an ILE instructor over at Leavenworth.<eos> Yeah, she's sweet.<eos> You'll like her.<eos> Well...<eos> Well, I think it's just great you're getting to see the president, honey.

This is so special.<eos> You know, the other day I was calculating the...<eos> I was working out that we've spent less than 30 days a year together for the last eight years.<eos> And... I was just thinking that it's really interesting, the way things happen.<eos> Well, if we hadn't gone to war... if September 11th hadn't happened... if America hadn't been attacked and we hadn't gone to war, I'd probably be barbecuing something in our backyard right now.<eos> But 9/11 did happen, didn't it?<eos> Yes. Yes, I know. I know.<eos> I know, and I am... I'm sorry.<eos> - I didn't say that to make you feel bad.<eos> - Why are you thinking about it?

Now, we've been kind enough to plan this operation in such a way as to not make it look like the Americans are here to get done what you couldn't.<eos> But that is what's happening.<eos> So, Frank... while your input is greatly appreciated...<eos> It is.<eos> I wouldn't want you to think that it isn't. It is.<eos> I'd also appreciate if you would take one nice, big step back and let me get this shit done.<eos> - What?<eos> - I can't get him.<eos> They're telling me he's in bed with a cold.<eos> Well, did you tell 'em what it's about?
Hello, who am I speaking with?<eos> This is General McMahon.<eos> I need to speak to President Karzai urgently.<eos> I understand he's not feeling well, but I need to speak with him.<eos> Is he awake?<eos> Good.<eos> Put him on. Put the call through.<eos> What do you mean, he doesn't have one? What world leader doesn't have a phone in his bedroom?<eos> Does he have a cell phone in there?<eos> - Did you try his cell phone?
You are proud members of the toughest fucking fighting force this world has ever known. Carry that knowledge with you!<eos> Carry it with pride!<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> That's right.<eos> Any of you so inclined, I'm gonna ask this chaplain to say a prayer for us.<eos> Thank you, Captain.<eos> Let us pray!<eos> Almighty God, as these marines prepare for battle, we pray that your Holy Spirit shall guide them.<eos> As you brought down the walls of Jericho, as you dealt out your wrath upon the Philistines, as you crushed the Hittites and brought retribution upon all the enemies of the righteous, may your mighty hand be upon these men and assure their victories.

Move.<eos> Contact front!<eos> Move! Move! Up against the wall!<eos> - Farrenberg. - Not too close.<eos> Get off the walls. Now!<eos> - Fuck!<eos> - Over there, twelve o'clock!<eos> Cole! Cole!<eos> I need to see a weapon. He isn't a combatant until I see a weapon.<eos> Fuck, man! You think this nigga on his morning jog?
Copy.<eos> Comin' up!<eos> We got movement, twelve o'clock.<eos> About 300 meters, two guys on the roof.<eos> - Are they armed?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It's a simple fucking question, Trey.<eos> Do you see a weapon?<eos> No.<eos> That's not what you asked. You asked if they were armed.
Fuck.<eos> Fucking short, man!<eos> - Again!<eos> - Short!<eos> - I know.<eos> One more!<eos> Fuck, yeah!<eos> Good job, Cole.<eos> Nice shooting, boys.<eos> - Farrenberg, you hit?
Fuck, yeah!<eos> Good job, Cole.<eos> Nice shooting, boys.<eos> - Farrenberg, you hit?<eos> - Nah.<eos> - Are you hit?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm good.<eos> - Fuck this shit!<eos> - Cole, where the fuck are you going?
Good job, Cole.<eos> Nice shooting, boys.<eos> - Farrenberg, you hit?<eos> - Nah.<eos> - Are you hit?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm good.<eos> - Fuck this shit!<eos> - Cole, where the fuck are you going?<eos> - Dude, where the fuck are you going?
I'm good.<eos> - Fuck this shit!<eos> - Cole, where the fuck are you going?<eos> - Dude, where the fuck are you going?<eos> - Fuck off! - Corporal, what's happening? - Wait, where the fuck are you going, man?<eos> - Shut the fuck up!<eos> - Wait, Cole! Cole!<eos> - Cole! Get back here, Cole!<eos> - Cole!<eos> Cole, what the fuck, man? Where you going?
Bottom line, this is gonna play bad, all right?<eos> It's gonna play really fucking bad. So we are in damage control now.<eos> Guys, guys... Is this really that bad?<eos> I mean, yeah, it's colorful, sure. But... this is Rolling Stone, okay? It's hip.<eos> And you guys... You guys are the operators.<eos> You know, you're out there, you're getting shit done in like a totally non-square way.<eos> Yes, Little, you fucking idiot, it's that bad.<eos> This was always a terrible idea.<eos> Why you would unnecessarily court attention like this is...<eos> - Simon, can you shut the fuck up?

You invited this Cullen fellow in, you didn't properly consult me!<eos> What?<eos> I didn't properly consult you? Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> We had a conversation.<eos> - Give me his phone number.<eos> - What? Whose phone number?<eos> This fucking Cullen fuck. Give me his fucking phone number!<eos> - I'm not gonna give you his phone number.<eos> - Why the fuck not?<eos> Because you're acting crazy! You're acting like a fucking lunatic right now!

You're acting like a fucking lunatic right now!<eos> You think this is crazy, huh?<eos> - You think this is me being crazy?<eos> - Peter! Calm down!<eos> You fucking calm down!<eos> Duckman!<eos> I'm gonna beat you down unless you chill out.
Not till I hear their side of it.<eos> Bartreceivedthe longest detention in history.<eos> Bored, he began to shoot baskets, a talent that would irrevocably make his life better.<eos> Then worse, then better, then the same.<eos> ♪ Wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat ♪<eos> ♪ And a '64 Impala ♪<eos> ♪ I wish I was, like, six-foot-nine ♪<eos> ♪ So I can get with Leoshi, 'cause she don't know me ♪<eos> ♪ But, yo, she's really fine ♪<eos> ♪ You know I see her all the time ♪
Just put it with the others.<eos> I'm worried he's getting a little spoiled.<eos> Oh, that's ridiculous.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> Bart says no unauthorized photography.<eos> Don't look directly at him!<eos> As Bart's showboating veered ever closer to globetrotting, the disrespect grew.<eos> Can you clean that for me, Coach?<eos> And that, and that, and those, and that, and that.<eos> What are you looking at?
What are you looking at?<eos> What the...?<eos> !<eos> Butafterone showboat shot too many,<eos> Homer Simpson had something he'd never had before: enough.<eos> Uh, son, some of the other parents are complaining.<eos> Apparently, they're attached to their children, and they want to see them touch the ball.<eos> They can touch it in the team photo.<eos> I'm going to draw up a play.<eos> One where you pass.

Bart didn't know it, but he was point shaving.<eos> That's when a player wins the game, but makes sure his team doesn't cover the spread.<eos> The team's happy, the gamblers are happy, everybody wins.<eos> The only unhappy person is someone like me, who has to explain the thing.<eos> Well, at least you'll let me play my saxophone.<eos> Good thing you cut that song.<eos> Did you know I once took a train halfway across Cleveland?<eos> This is not a video trick.<eos> He really just stopped moving, but Bart had just gotten started.<eos> You could be an accessory to a crime, you know.

I see a little girl with futile dreams of fitting in.<eos> Gee whiz, you don't have to be so mean.<eos> That's the business I'm in!<eos> Whoa!<eos> Hey!<eos> Shoot!<eos> Shoot!<eos> Just like I drew it up!<eos> Okay, here's a shot:<eos> you're not bald, your hair left out of embarrassment.
Okay, here's a shot:<eos> you're not bald, your hair left out of embarrassment.<eos> Why, you little...!<eos> I'll teach you to win the game!<eos> You stupid buzzer-beating, clutch-shooting...<eos> Oh, come on, man.<eos> - ...ice water in your veins...<eos> - I'm taking my talents to Shelbyville.<eos> ...here comes the post-game interview!<eos> - You have to give them credit...

Tighten on him then rack focus to me.<eos> Dad, this is supposed to be about us getting together.<eos> Fine.<eos> Tighten on him.<eos> Rack focus to me.<eos> Cut to a wide shot.<eos> Split screen with Marge.<eos> Truck in, nice and slow.<eos> Then cut to a "B" roll of me eating a tuna fish sandwich.<eos> Dad, how did you learn these things?
Like I've been rejected.<eos> Nothing but net!<eos> Which is what my mom wears in the strip club.<eos> It was in the third quarter when the game really got weird, and I got a low bar for weird.<eos> Bart went to shoot, and took a hard foul from his own best friend.<eos> Let's just say Bart wasn't the only one Fat Tony had gotten to.<eos> This was my bobblehead.<eos> They got to him, in my bedroom, where he bobbled.<eos> Hey, let's just say that bobblehead won't be attending no more giveaway days.<eos> You keep shooting your mouth, you'll wind up in that building going up on Third Street.

Is he going for a gun?<eos> Oh.<eos> Get me a gun.<eos> We thought we were goners.<eos> Our lives flashed before our eyes.<eos> I had a lot of crazy jobs.<eos> And then the cavalry came on her stupid high horse.<eos> Let them go.<eos> Really?<eos> And what do you have on me?
The goods.<eos> The goods?<eos> Oh, that sounds bad.<eos> Fat Tony, may I speak to you in Italian?<eos> I don't know Italian.<eos> How about Sicilian?<eos> That's a language?<eos> How about I say it like Porky Pig?<eos> E-ba-dee, e-ba-dee, e-ba-dee, e-ba-dee, e-ba-dee...<eos> Say what you got to say.
E-ba-dee, e-ba-dee, e-ba-dee, e-ba-dee, e-ba-dee...<eos> Say what you got to say.<eos> Turns out I'm the hero of this documentary.<eos> I think that deserves a chyron.<eos> It happens that Fat Tony had a secret, a secret I had uncovered with a little bit of research.<eos> I wondered, if Fat Tony liked basketball so much, why didn't he play?<eos> Turns out he had.<eos> For a girls' team.<eos> And if there's one thing a Mafia boss doesn't want known, it's that he was the third-string shooting guard on the Springfield Little Debbies.<eos> You keep quiet about what you know.

The man Spanx you wear?<eos> Your high school nickname, Robert DeZero?<eos> The way you cried at Toy Story 2?<eos> That's not even the sad one.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> Why do you keep talking?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's a nervous condition.<eos> Can you give me the name of that secret shrink you see?
Why do I keep going there?<eos> - ♪ Let's go ♪ - ♪ They're playing basketball ♪<eos> ♪ All around the world ♪<eos> ♪ We love that basketball... ♪<eos> And Nelson's dad came back.<eos> And I should know.<eos> He's me.<eos> Haw-haw!<eos> Papa!<eos> So, you're making narrator money.

Everybody wants to prove who's the richest.<eos> They're vicious.<eos> Add alcohol to the mix and the fact that women don't let things go...<eos> They're like the Olympic athletes of grudges.<eos> It's sexist how the women always get blamed.<eos> It all goes back to that incident on Orientation Day.<eos> And at the root of it was Madeline Mackenzie.<eos> You have nothing to be nervous about.<eos> Your sister loved going there and so will you.<eos> In fact, you should be excited.
Do you know why?<eos> Because this is the very first day of the rest of your life.<eos> Okay, woman.<eos> I am not 100% sure about that tone, young lady.<eos> And could you please turn it down, please?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Mother...<eos> - Fucker!<eos> Chloe Adeline Mackenzie!<eos> - You were thinking it.
- That's a great name. - Thanks.<eos> This is my daughter, Chloe, the one shrinking from embarrassment over there.<eos> Are you new to Monterey?<eos> Yeah, we just moved here a few weeks ago.<eos> Well, I'm Madeline Martha Mackenzie.<eos> I always say the Martha, but no one calls me that. They call me Madeline.<eos> I'm Jane. Jane No-Middle-Name Chapman.<eos> Jane No-Middle-Name Chapman.<eos> I like you already.<eos> You're an intrinsically nice person, and I have a nose for these sorts of things.
The over-and-under in this town is about 150,000.<eos> I work in community theater 20 hours a week, so I'm definitely an "under."<eos> What do you do?<eos> Just bookkeeping, so... most definitely an "under," too.<eos> When I grow up, I'm gonna run a massive label.<eos> Do you have plans?<eos> He's a little nervous.<eos> Relax, he's walking in with Chloe.<eos> That's like walking in with the golden ticket.<eos> What kind of music do you listen to?
An autopsy is still being conducted to ascertain the exact cause of death, but at this point we can confirm that the victim suffered a broken pelvis... and a fracture at the base of the skull.<eos> Come on, guys, would you put the guns down?<eos> Come on, Josh, you gotta get your jacket zipped. Let's go.<eos> Perry, help me out, here.<eos> What did we say about shooting Mom before noon?<eos> - Could you put the guns down? - Guys. - We have to go.<eos> I am not kidding. Really.<eos> First one to the car gets a dollar!<eos> Just takes money.<eos> You are so bad.

Pregnant again?<eos> Of course. When am I not? You look fantastic.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Did you...?<eos> No, but you're sweet to think I did. - Well, you look fabulous.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Hi, Jackie.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Okay, Gabby is such a gossip. We don't like her.<eos> Hey, Maddie, have you seen Justin at all?
Well, joined the board at PayPal.<eos> What was I thinking, adding one more thing to my life?<eos> Hold on, these are my "Hamilton" tickets.<eos> - I've seen it four times. Yes?<eos> I'll see you in there.<eos> Here, come meet my best friend.<eos> Celeste! Hey, Bill. How you been?<eos> - When did you get to town?<eos> Late last night.<eos> - You didn't call me. - No, I'm sorry.

Good, they saved my spot.<eos> - Hello, Tom!<eos> - Madeline!<eos> What's happened to you?<eos> I bravely injured myself. I've twisted my ankle.<eos> Come meet my new friend, Jane.<eos> Here, sit down.<eos> It's my knight in shining armor.<eos> She rescued me like a wounded dog in the street. Hi.<eos> And you know what else?
- Nice to meet you, funny Jane. - Nice to meet you.<eos> I think she just moved to this area for your delicious coffee.<eos> So, do you mind getting... would you like one?<eos> - Yeah, please.<eos> - Three, please.<eos> And will you throw in something chocolate that won't make my ass look fat?<eos> - You got it. - Thank you.<eos> Everybody moves here for the education.<eos> Basically, it's private school at a public school price.<eos> Anyway, you're gonna love it.

I shouldn't assume.<eos> Boyfriend, girlfriend? I'm open to all possibilities.<eos> No, no husband or partner, just me.<eos> - What about Ziggy's dad? - Easy, girl.<eos> - Okay, I'm only wondering.<eos> - It's fine.<eos> He's not in the picture. He was actually never in the picture.<eos> - We weren't together.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Where'd you move here from? - Just Santa Cruz.
What do I know of Jane Chapman?<eos> Nothing, nothing.<eos> I'm fine. You okay?<eos> Nobody knows nothing about anybody.<eos> You can write that down, Detective, and underline it.<eos> - What is it, honey?<eos> - It's weird.<eos> Sometimes when I'm in a new place, I get this sensation.<eos> Like, if only I were here.<eos> - But you are here.
- It's weird.<eos> Sometimes when I'm in a new place, I get this sensation.<eos> Like, if only I were here.<eos> - But you are here.<eos> - I know.<eos> It's like I'm on the outside looking in.<eos> Or like... you know, like, I see this life and this moment, and it's so wonderful, but it doesn't quite belong to me.<eos> Does that make any sense?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Are you following this?

- That's true. - Stop.<eos> And I'm not saying that to embarrass you at all, but it is true.<eos> You are, and so are you, and...<eos> I agree.<eos> You guys are just right.<eos> You're exactly right.<eos> And for some reason, that makes me feel... wrong, I guess.<eos> I know I sound crazy.<eos> - It's not crazy. I mean, I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> But if you were crazy, you'd fit in perfectly in this town.
Delicious.<eos> We love crazy people here.<eos> Hold it! That's right.<eos> You guys, hold it.<eos> Two, one, and lift.<eos> Good job, you guys.<eos> Sweetie, it's fine. Go back to work. - I'll pick up Skye.<eos> - No, it's not fine. She can be hostile with me, but not you.<eos> And I'm coming with you.<eos> You think she should keep all her emotions bottled up inside?
And I'm coming with you.<eos> You think she should keep all her emotions bottled up inside?<eos> - Who does that serve?<eos> - "Am I missing the math?"<eos> Bitch.<eos> Can't she see that it has nothing to do with you?<eos> None of us really see things as they are;<eos> We see things as we are.<eos> Come on, Bonnie, give me a break.<eos> The kids are in the same class together. Madeline's eventually gonna discover how smart you are.
Everyone knew Nathan was a little bit of a dick. But a likeable one.<eos> I never liked him.<eos> I liked his wife.<eos> - There he is.<eos> - Hi, baby!<eos> - Look at him. He's so happy. - Mommy!<eos> - How was it? - Fun!<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - I made friends. You made friends?<eos> You already made friends? That's so exciting!
- Pleased to meet you.<eos> She's French.<eos> Good for them to learn a language, you know?<eos> I just thought it was nice for the nannies to get to know each other and have your own little support system.<eos> Renata, Jane is not a nanny.<eos> She's a mom, just young.<eos> Like you used to be? - Maddie.<eos> - Like we used to be?<eos> - Maddie, hi. - Hi.<eos> I heard you're working at the community theater.
- Maddie, hi. - Hi.<eos> I heard you're working at the community theater.<eos> I wanted to talk to you about the petition thing, about the play.<eos> There's been some concern about it being appropriate.<eos> There's a petition to stop the play?<eos> That play was kind of like a lifeline for Madeline.<eos> You know, it tethered her to a purpose.<eos> I signed it.<eos> - Excuse me!<eos> - You signed it? - I did.
- No, him.<eos> - This boy?<eos> - Yes, he tried to choke me. - What?<eos> - It wasn't me. Yes, it was.<eos> Ziggy, sweetie, we just need you to say "sorry."<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> I didn't.<eos> Are you sure that it was this little boy, sweetie?<eos> Could she have gotten it wrong?<eos> Can you say you're sorry to Amabella?
- Renata!<eos> - Stay out of it.<eos> I can't make him apologize for something that I know he didn't do.<eos> We will schedule a meeting for another time.<eos> We can handle this later.<eos> Okay, this is unacceptable. Let's go, baby.<eos> Um, all right, everyone, thank you.<eos> Not that there's a right little girl to strangle, but he picked the wrong little girl to strangle.<eos> Ziggy... do you see her neck?<eos> If you ever touch my little girl like that again, you're gonna be in big trouble. - Hey.
Harper Stimson. Hi.<eos> Jane just didn't fit here.<eos> Kind of like a dirty old Prius parked outside of Barneys.<eos> - Welcome to Monterey. - Thank you.<eos> It was a mistake to let people compete, but that is not what got someone killed.<eos> Hi, Celeste.<eos> How is Perry?<eos> He's good. Thank you.<eos> - If it'll help...<eos> - You didn't ask me how Ed was.
Chloe.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The teacher couldn't have handled it worse.<eos> "Point out the suspect, Amabella"?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I take it this Jane's kind of damaged.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> You're drawn to damaged people. - I am not.<eos> - Even Celeste.<eos> There's something wounded about her, if you ask me.
I didn't ask, and I'm not drawn to damaged people.<eos> Do I like to help people in need? Yes.<eos> Last time I checked, that's not a character flaw.<eos> I see that look.<eos> I just think to be accused of something so horrible on your very first day at a new school...<eos> Can you imagine anything worse?<eos> Being choked, maybe?<eos> Bruises heal, stigmas can last a lifetime.<eos> You don't think assault victims bear lifetime emotional injuries?<eos> I don't know. Is there a recent study you'd like to illuminate the family about, Abigail?

It's something.<eos> You said, "All right."

Would you like to assign meaning to that or was it just a nervous tic?<eos> Guys, Mom had a day.<eos> - And don't you start.<eos> - I'm on your side, woman.<eos> I'm gonna go with a nervous tic.<eos> I think his "all right" meant "let's not fight at the dinner table."<eos> Were we fighting?<eos> I didn't realize we were fighting.<eos> We were about to.<eos> You said I probably read some study on women assault victims, and I would've responded with, "No",
I didn't realize we were fighting.<eos> We were about to.<eos> You said I probably read some study on women assault victims, and I would've responded with, "No",<eos> I learned it in my Self-Defense and Wellness class, which happens to be taught by Bonnie, who, by the very mention of her name, makes your eyes twitch, so Ed said "all right" to head it off.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, speaking of Bonnie, do you know what she did today?<eos> She signed a petition to stop our production of "Avenue Q."<eos> Is this the play where the puppets drop the F-bombs?<eos> Cool!<eos> It is not only not about that, but it's actually a play that you should see because it deals with the struggle of young adults being disillusioned with life, feeling demoralized and defrauded by the false promises of tomorrow.
Hey, Mom, you wanna play Angry Beaver?<eos> In a minute. I just need to get one more shot.<eos> I think the angry beaver is gonna get you, Mom. Yeah.<eos> Is he? - I hope not.<eos> That... - Rawr!<eos> - The angry beaver is back! And he is hungry!<eos> Hungry for Mama's beaver. Just stop!<eos> She his delicious!<eos> Have a bite of this.<eos> - What happened? You're not going to Vienna?
- Really?<eos> It's their first day of school tomorrow. I can't miss that.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Of course.<eos> I kind of agree with Thea...<eos> People over 40 shouldn't be gushy. It's not cute.<eos> I mean, last week, she came home and peeled potatoes at a homeless shelter, and she couldn't stop talking about what a beautiful experience it was to contribute.<eos> I mean, she whines if I ask her to set the table, but peel one fucking potato with Bonnie...<eos> Well, Bonnie is a positive influence.<eos> What, you'd rather Abby be out with her friends, smoking pot?

She just marched right into that school like some sort of a woman-child.<eos> She never turned around.<eos> It was like she was on her own. "Bye, Mom.<eos> See you later."<eos> I just feel like they're gonna grow up and they're gonna be gone, and... this will be you and I, and we're gonna be on to another chapter of our life.<eos> You have another chapter, you have a business. And... and...

And... and...<eos> I don't. I'm a mom.<eos> This is my universe. And currently, that universe is in meltdown because my oldest daughter prefers to hang out with her fucking step-thing.<eos> Hey, you will never lose them.
Hey, you will never lose them.<eos> And you know that.<eos> I just thought one day Nathan would get his due. For some reason, Abigail would love me more.<eos> He hasn't paid in the slightest for any of it.<eos> And now he's got Bonnie, and she's younger and sexier and prettier. She probably gives mint-flavored, organic blowjobs.<eos> And Abigail likes to hang out with them and be buddies.<eos> And he got it all. He won.<eos> Well, speaking as the consolation prize, we're gonna have a pretty big fight - about what you just said. - No, no, no.<eos> I did not mean it like that.<eos> You are the greatest thing that ever happened to me, and don't you for one minute think anything else.
I'm not liked.<eos> What was that?<eos> I said I'm not liked.<eos> That simply isn't true, honey.<eos> It's one thing to be demonized for having the temerity of a career.<eos> But... but look at this.<eos> Look at our life.<eos> What kind of person chooses to work?<eos> Certainly not a mother, by any acceptable standards.<eos> You should've seen the way they looked at me today. My God.
Certainly not a mother, by any acceptable standards.<eos> You should've seen the way they looked at me today. My God.<eos> And on the one morning that I chose not to go to the office... - Yep, yep, yep. - And join my daughter for her orientation.<eos> And then defend her when she's physically assaulted...<eos> And, yes, I reacted.<eos> Humanly, like any mom would.<eos> And then, I'm met with utter contempt.<eos> Look, I'm sure there are those, women especially, who would resent you.<eos> I mean, look at you. Come on.<eos> You're beautiful, hugely successful, financially independent, on the school committee, the... the board of the aquarium.

- Right? - Yeah.<eos> Hell, yeah.<eos> And to make matters even worse... you're beyond sexy.<eos> Women.<eos> You all want to be the envy of your friends, but God forbid you garner too much of it.<eos> The mom was awful, but the girl seemed fine.<eos> So, what's gonna happen?<eos> Um, I don't know.<eos> I think the teacher said that we should just let it go, move forward, so I guess that's what we're gonna do.<eos> I still don't understand why you chose to move there. All alone.

All alone.<eos> I'm not. I have friends.<eos> People here are actually very friendly.<eos> People need family in their lives, you know?<eos> I really just think you should come back here.
Hey, Mom.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I love you.<eos> Hi, baby.<eos> Sorry I woke you up.<eos> Am I in trouble?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Hey, you trust me, right?<eos> And I trust you.<eos> Did you touch that little girl, baby?
It's okay if you did.<eos> Ziggy?<eos> No.<eos> I believe you.<eos> Why did she say I did?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe she was confused. She probably just got it wrong.<eos> Am I going to have any friends?<eos> Of course you are, my love.<eos> You're gonna have so many friends.
Maybe she was confused. She probably just got it wrong.<eos> Am I going to have any friends?<eos> Of course you are, my love.<eos> You're gonna have so many friends.<eos> Come here.<eos> - Honey? - Yeah. I think we need to talk about the SAT tutor.<eos> I know what you're gonna say, but your scores just aren't good enough right now, honey. - You know, the whole college thing, it's kind of a racket, especially liberal arts.<eos> People go off and study Homer for four years and then you graduate with a ton of debt and no job prospect.<eos> Okay, let me be clear.<eos> You're going to college.

I'm sorry that you hate Bonnie and that I'm unable to.<eos> I don't hate Bonnie.<eos> And this isn't about your dad or Bonnie or me.<eos> This is about you, Abigail, and your future.<eos> And what I'm saying is is the metric of success is not always monetary or career-related.<eos> It can be a much more holistic equation.<eos> Okay, I'm not gonna pretend to be the person in your life who knows the most about the holistic wonder of the world. What I do know, and I know this for sure, Abigail, is that... when it all comes down to it, you have to be independent and you have to be self-sufficient.<eos> I was a very young mother when I had you.<eos> All that "it takes a village" crap is only good to a certain extent, because even the best-laid plans of your life go poof in your face.<eos> And in that case, you need to be strong, and independent, and educated, and... and a strong woman.

My superpower...<eos> I actually get it from Mom.<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> What did we have for dinner tonight with the... with the steak?<eos> Um, Mom's spinach salad?<eos> Mom's spinach salad.<eos> Top secret, okay?<eos> "G is for George, smothered under a rug.<eos> H is for Hector, done in by a thug."<eos> You startled me.
Well, to be safe, we should tell Josh and Max to keep their distance from him.<eos> I don't think that's gonna be necessary.<eos> Honey, if the kid is violent... No, he's not violent.<eos> How do you know he's not violent?<eos> What, because he seemed sweet?<eos> - First off, he could be innocent.<eos> We don't want the boys to be getting mixed up with the wrong crowd.<eos> - They're six.<eos> - They're not to associate with him.<eos> You're being ridiculous.

The play means a lot to you, right?<eos> I'll tell Bonnie to start a new petition in favor.<eos> Mom, are you okay?<eos> You're not, like, dying or anything, are you?<eos> No, I'm not dying.<eos> What would make you ask me that?<eos> You seem a little wobbly.<eos> Are you having one of your massive periods? No.<eos> What people don't tell you is that... you lose your children.<eos> As beautiful and wonderful as you are now, the little girl whose curly hair I used to detangle, the one who had bad dreams and would crawl into my bed, she's gone.

I'm your daughter and you're my mother.
Not in public.<eos> Not another one.<eos> You go back to bed!<eos> I love that song.<eos> Do you want to play it together?<eos> We're treating the matter as a homicide.<eos> We have no suspects as of yet.<eos> I will say that we do believe we have spoken to the person or persons involved.<eos> What are we doing?<eos> You're sleepwalking again, baby.
Would... would you just hold these items for me till I get back?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - All righty. - Thanks.<eos> I'll be back. - I'll be here.<eos> Your call cannot be accepted at this time.<eos> Please try your call again later.<eos> Hi, honey, you're home.<eos> Have you seen my wallet anywhere?<eos> Yeah, I just saw it in your room.<eos> You must've left without it.
You must've left without it.<eos> Well, I have someone else's wallet, and I don't know how I got it.<eos> Let me see.<eos> Yeah. It's not your wallet.<eos> Should I put it in the mailbox?<eos> No, I wouldn't do that.<eos> No, it might belong to someone in the motel. They'll...<eos> They'll come looking for it. I just don't remember checking this person in.<eos> Mother?<eos> Do you ever have the feeling that you've had the same nightmare over and over again but that you can't remember it?

Put it in the safe.<eos> Why would I put it in the safe?<eos> Because someone might come looking for it, and I don't want it to get lost.<eos> You know what your memory's like.
David.<eos> David Davidson.<eos> That's my name.<eos> You don't need any other information.<eos> There's the money.<eos> May I have a key?<eos> Do let me know if I can do anything else for you, Mr. David Davidson.<eos> I can't stand not seeing you.<eos> Bates Motel. Norman speaking.<eos> Norman, what are you doing?
Dinner's gonna get cold.<eos> Okay, Mother.<eos> I'm just coming.<eos> I'll... I'll be right there.<eos> Norman?<eos> Is that you?<eos> There you are.<eos> Did you buy something called luminol?<eos> No, not that I remember.<eos> Are you sure you didn't order it?
No, not that I remember.<eos> Are you sure you didn't order it?<eos> No, I didn't order anything.<eos> Do you know what it is?<eos> No... it just sounds like a cleaning product.<eos> Come and sit down.<eos> I'm sure the receipt's somewhere in the house.<eos> Come.<eos> I hate having blackouts.<eos> Well, you could start taking your medicine again.
And what does that mean, ""?<eos> It means ""<eos> as in, "How about that?"<eos> First of all, Mother, she is married.<eos> That can be irrelevant.<eos> No, second of all, she works in a store, and I'm going to go in and just buy some paint from her.<eos> So do you really have a problem with that?<eos> - No.<eos> - Good.<eos> I just don't know what you're thinking.
Here we go.<eos> Mother, what is wrong with you?<eos> What is wrong with me?<eos> Well, let me see, for...<eos> Let's see, for starters,<eos> I am dead.<eos> And why am I pretending to be dead?<eos> So I could get away from everyone and everything that could distract me from you, okay?<eos> I know that, and I appreciate it.<eos> You appreciate it?
I mean, a mentally ill boy and a dead woman.<eos> We're actually doing it.<eos> We're... we have customers.<eos> We... we... we have a life.<eos> I know, and I appreciate it.<eos> Stop saying you appreciate it!<eos> I'm sorry, Mother.<eos> It's not fair to you. I know that.<eos> It's not that, okay? It's not... it's not that.<eos> It's that... you... you just can't have other people in your life.

It's that... you... you just can't have other people in your life.<eos> I mean, what are you gonna do?<eos> Bring her over? I mean, where am I gonna go?<eos> In a closet?<eos> I'm not gonna bring her here to dinner. It's... this...<eos> This is absurd.<eos> I know you, Norman.<eos> Come on, I know you. I know you better than anyone.<eos> You can't have other people in your life, especially women.<eos> You're just making my job harder.

Mother...<eos> What dream am I in, Mother?<eos> Good morning.<eos> You get some sleep?<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> It was amazing.<eos> Where's Caleb?<eos> He went to town to get some... Some bagels and coffee.<eos> That's sweet.<eos> You know, um...
No, no... No, no, no. I was actually gonna stop by later today.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Let me walk you to your car.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> This place is awfully cute.<eos> We... I...<eos> I like it.<eos> I'd love to see the house.<eos> Yeah, well, I'd love to show it to you. It's just a little bit of a mess right now, so.<eos> You live here all alone since your mom died?

You should come.
Truly.<eos> But you have to leave.<eos> It kills me to say this, but...<eos> You being here is gonna force Dylan to live a lie with his daughter every time you're in the house.<eos> I don't know the exact circumstances of how he came into this world, but I know enough to know that you're putting him in an impossible position.<eos> I understand.<eos> - I wish it could be different.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> I guess my coming here was kind of... It was my own self-denial.<eos> I know you're right.

I'll just, um...<eos> I'll clean up here when I'm done and turn the lights out.<eos> It's all good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Are you going somewhere?
Small business owners as in hardware stores?<eos> Mother...<eos> It's fine. Go ahead.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah, go ahead. But you can't take the car.<eos> Why not?<eos> It's not like you need it.<eos> You aren't supposed to be driving.<eos> I have driven the car, you know, Mother. Many times.<eos> You know that. But you shouldn't be; You have blackouts.

Okay?<eos> Just walk.<eos> You know what? I don't have time to just walk, Mother.<eos> I'll miss most of it.<eos> I think I'm gonna drive.<eos> Mother... get back in that house right now.<eos> You should not be out here.

So you're looking on my computer now?<eos> Yeah, that's what I'm doing, looking at your computer.<eos> No, I'm not looking at your computer.<eos> I know you.<eos> I know you better than you know yourself.<eos> And that's why you make me so angry...<eos> Because you keep doing shit that just makes more work for me.<eos> Asking me questions that I can't give you answers to because I'm just trying to take care of you.<eos> Well, who asked you to take care of me?<eos> What do you think you're trying to protect me from?

No, I don't, Mother.
No one is trying to hurt me.<eos> Fine!<eos> Come with me!<eos> You want to see what I do for you? No, I don't, Mother.<eos> Let's just drop this.<eos> A little late for that.<eos> Look in here.<eos> I don't want to look in there.<eos> Mother, never mind, okay?<eos> Do you remember the night you were putting up the shower curtains?
Do you remember the night you were putting up the shower curtains?<eos> Do you remember a man showing up?<eos> No, Mother, no, I don't.<eos> You Norman Bates?<eos> I don't want to remember. I don't want to remember.<eos> It's too late!<eos> Why was he trying to kill me, Mother?<eos> I don't know.<eos> How did you get into the room so quickly?<eos> Why were you even outside?
But why was he trying to kill me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> This feels deep enough.<eos> Turn it off!<eos> Someone's gonna hear it.<eos> - I'm trying. - Norman, hurry.<eos> Just chuck it in the water!<eos> An inmate at the Bend Correctional Facility is attempting to contact you.<eos> To accept the call, press 1.<eos> Norman, what are you doing?
- Nope. I absolute... - I got this.<eos> I got this.<eos> - I absolutely can't do it.<eos> - Come on, Jess! But remember, this is a stupid frat boy ritual, so...<eos> Yeah, but kick their ass!<eos> - Yeah, fuck 'em up!<eos> - Hey. - We're together.<eos> Only two cups left.<eos> No, there's one cup.<eos> You're just seeing double.
- Hey. - We're together.<eos> Only two cups left.<eos> No, there's one cup.<eos> You're just seeing double.<eos> Oh, God! There's only one cups left.<eos> - I can't do it. It's too much pressure.<eos> - What? - I can't do it, Jess.<eos> - Look... Look at me.<eos> You got us through the Wendy's drive-through when my car had no windshield and three tires.<eos> You can do anything.
The key is, right foot only for, like, a while.<eos> - You know? Make him beg for...<eos> - The left one.<eos> I know. Focus!<eos> If we win this, we will be the only girls to ever win the Halloween tournament.<eos> We've got to do this.<eos> For womankind.<eos> Stop making me horny, and shoot!<eos> We did it! - I want up! I want up!<eos> I want up! - You deserve it. You've earned it.
Yeah, I feel like this weekend has come at the worst possible time.<eos> I'm so stressed out.<eos> You'll see your friends, you'll have fun.<eos> It'll be restorative. Like that time we took Xanax and slept for 16 hours.<eos> Oh, God, that was good.<eos> You know, I love those girls, but I really just don't want to have a party weekend right now.<eos> I want to have a weekend with you.<eos> - I miss you.<eos> - I miss you, too.<eos> - You've been at the office, like, nonstop. - I know.
- I miss you.<eos> - I miss you, too.<eos> - You've been at the office, like, nonstop. - I know.<eos> Wait, wait, one...<eos> If we keep kissing, I'm gonna want to have sex.<eos> I'm okay with that.<eos> - I'm down.<eos> - Okay. But I have, like, four things I have to do before.<eos> I just have to print out those itineraries for the city council meeting. And I have to email the Herald. I have, like, a 25-minute-ish interview.<eos> - I... I tell you what, I'm gonna let you do all that, and I'm gonna go masturbate in the shower and go to sleep.
I'll pick you up after school on Monday, okay, sweetie?<eos> Mommy, do you have to go to Miami?<eos> Yes, I really do.<eos> But I'm gonna miss you so much.<eos> Technically, my time started 20 minutes ago, so, going to note this for the custody hearing.<eos> I love you.<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> Damn.<eos> Damn.<eos> How do you do it? How do you look this flawless getting off a plane?
Yes, I really do.<eos> But I'm gonna miss you so much.<eos> Technically, my time started 20 minutes ago, so, going to note this for the custody hearing.<eos> I love you.<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> Damn.<eos> Damn.<eos> How do you do it? How do you look this flawless getting off a plane?<eos> It's honestly rude.<eos> What, are you flirting with me?
- You're serious.<eos> Oh, my God, did you hear Alice is making us go to a foam party?<eos> I know.<eos> She has a scary amount of time on her hands.<eos> Even though she's a full-time teacher, I'm still like, "Get a job."<eos> Do you have a job?<eos> Activism is a full-time job, but... Also no.<eos> Look at them, the magic is still there.<eos> - It is all happening!<eos> God, you smell so good.
She'll start on the couch.<eos> - Blair. - What?<eos> Can you be careful with the red wine on the white carpet, please?<eos> My biggest and only donor generously lent us this house for the weekend.<eos> - So, please be careful.<eos> - Okay. I'm telling you, she's got bigger problems than a wine stain if she wants to sell this place for 3.4 in this market.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - Zillow. - I Zillow everybody.<eos> - Really?<eos> Like, do you know how much my house is worth?
Oh, my God!<eos> - Oh, my God. - Yes, mami.<eos> Is that a sex swing?<eos> Your donor is a freak, Jess.<eos> Please. She rents this house out.<eos> I'm sure somebody else left it here accidentally.<eos> And installed a load-bearing beam to support it accidentally. - Yeah.<eos> - Oh, my God, Jess. I want to audition some dresses for tonight.<eos> I brought 14. Come on!<eos> Jess, if you are working, - I'm gonna smack you in the face right now. - I'm not.
What?<eos> Vegemite? They should call you cuckoos instead of Kiwis.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> That's funny on several levels, because I'm actually Australian and a Kiwi is a New Zealander.<eos> There's nothing wrong with being a Kiwi, we all love Kiwis, but, it's sort of like calling a Chinese person Japanese.<eos> It's just sort of like, little bit racist to not recognize the cultural differences there, you know?<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> Eat me out. It's a fruit, Kiwi.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> Pippa, what do you do?
A chair.<eos> A chair.<eos> I'm so excited to see you. It's been so long.<eos> - Tell me everything.<eos> - I'm dying.<eos> The flight was literally amazoir.<eos> It's toast, toast time.<eos> Raise your glasses, Jess.<eos> Gosh, I can't believe you're getting married.<eos> Feels like just yesterday you were showing me how to hide that cat scratch on my face with that cover-up.
I remember that.<eos> And even though we don't get to see you all the time because you're so busy with Peter and the campaign and changing your Brita filters or whatever it is you white people do,<eos> I love you, and you're my best friend.<eos> To me and Jess.<eos> - Be-cheers. - Cheers.<eos> Again. I love you, Alice.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Three toasts is the limit tonight, though. You're cut off.<eos> If you're gonna do another one, do it now, 'cause I'm gonna go to the bathroom.<eos> - Do you want to come?
Be-mazing? I don't know how she would say it, but she is incredible!<eos> I am telling you, she is one of us.<eos> - She is so free-spirited.<eos> - Totally.<eos> - I just... I love her. - I don't know about that.<eos> - Do you guys feel like she's here on a work visa, or, like, a tourist visa or, like, illegally?<eos> - Like, what's her deal?<eos> - She's here for a bachelorette party. - That is crazy.<eos> - Build a wall. - I just, like, don't... I don't want to do anything illegal tonight.<eos> - What? - You don't? You just snorted a mound of cocaine.
You guys, I don't want a stripper.<eos> I think he looks like he's on something.<eos> He's definitely on something.<eos> Like bath salts.<eos> Oh, my God, he's gonna eat our faces.<eos> - Oh, God, he would! - This vintage remote is so confusing.<eos> Yes! Maybe somebody else should go.<eos> - Stripper. Stripper, stripper.<eos> - So, this is Jess, the bride-to-be, your subject, okay?<eos> And lucky for you, so lucky, you get to do whatever you want.
Wait a minute.<eos> You guys, wait a minute!<eos> It was an accident. Right?<eos> So, like, we're not gonna get in trouble for an accident.<eos> We're in Florida, Alice.<eos> A white dude is dead at the hands of a bunch of women.<eos> Yeah, white women.<eos> I'm black, in case any of you have forgotten.<eos> I think the only person who's forgotten that is you.<eos> How dare you.
- Hang up. Hang up. - Yeah, I am.<eos> Did you do whippets again? You sound really weird.<eos> - What?<eos> - Is everything all right? - Hang up.<eos> - Stop, stop, stop. - Peter, something really bad happened. - No.<eos> - What?<eos> - No, this guy came over. He was a stripper, like, a prostitute.<eos> - And we were drunk, and coked up, and I don't know what to do.<eos> About what? The wedding?<eos> Jess, do you still want to get married?
Look at this ring.<eos> It's even bigger in real life than it is on Skype.<eos> Yeah, he did a good job.<eos> You guys Skype?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Do we?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's really nice to just sort of, you know, see the person when you're talking to them.<eos> - I didn't know that.<eos> - Yes. You don't know Skype?
- Here you go, sir. Thank you.<eos> - Thought I peed. I didn't pee.<eos> - Thank you very much for the ride.<eos> - Thank you. - Safe home!<eos> - What the fuck is going on in here?<eos> We're starting a garage band.<eos> Do you guys play bass? We're hiding a body.<eos> What do you think we're doing?<eos> Stop saying "body" so many times.<eos> - Alice, what the hell are you doing, man? - Sorry. - Come on.
- It's a burner phone.<eos> - Good.<eos> Like I told Rob Lowe, if there's no body, there's no case.<eos> We can't just chop him up.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll just tell the cops it was just me.<eos> No, we all moved the body.<eos> It's a crime.<eos> Well, yeah, but if we just, like, explain the situation...<eos> What are you talking about, "Explain"?
My career.<eos> It's all over, just like that.<eos> I'm gonna do real time.<eos> Maybe life.<eos> You guys are gonna get off with a few years.<eos> I can't do any years.<eos> I'm in the middle of a custody battle.<eos> - What? What?<eos> Malcolm and I separated six months ago.<eos> You didn't tell me.

Hey, it's Blair.<eos> Don't leave a message.<eos> Okay. That's it. None of them are picking up.<eos> That means something really bad happened.<eos> Dude, this is, like, the third girlfriend that's cheated on you.<eos> What is that? What's going on, buddy?<eos> Does your dick bend weird when it gets hard?<eos> - All right.<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> Let's get you on Tinder right now, so you can start on a rebound.

- That news story?<eos> Lisa Marie Nowak was an astronaut.<eos> And she was in love with another astronaut named Will.<eos> Now, Will cheated on Lisa with some hottie Air Force captain.<eos> Lisa found out and was pissed.<eos> So, Lisa decided to deal with it. Once and for all.<eos> And she got a bunch of adult diapers, so she wouldn't have to piss on the way, and she drove straight from Houston to Orlando to, like, kidnap the Air Force...<eos> It's... The story gets dark quick.<eos> Point is, she used that crazy astrophysicist brain to find the quickest way to Florida.<eos> - You want to get Jess back, right?

Okay, Spanish language CDs. If Jess hooked up with a Spanish speaker, you're gonna want to reason with him.<eos> And I got this generic Russian Adderall. My little brother ordered it online.<eos> It will help you focus.<eos> It's super strong, but it is expired, so...<eos> - Thank you so much. - Hey.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you, too, dude.<eos> - Get her back.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> You are peeing.
- I love you.<eos> - I love you, too, dude.<eos> - Get her back.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> You are peeing.<eos> I'm so scared.<eos> I feel like we should say something.<eos> - Yeah. - Yeah. Good idea.<eos> We're really sorry.<eos> - You deserved better.
We're really sorry.<eos> - You deserved better.<eos> There's nothing we could do to bring you back, but...<eos> We promise to spend the rest of our lives trying to be better people.<eos> We owe that to you.<eos> God, we're so sorry.<eos> So sorry.<eos> So sorry, man.<eos> We suck.<eos> Okay, you can dump him now!
I did it!<eos> - Oh, my God, what the fuck is she doing?<eos> - What is she doing?<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> I'm good.<eos> I'm really good.<eos> Are you sure, 'cause you landed right on your neck.<eos> Yeah, I just did a sort of straight shot, landed on the neck, snap, and we're back up.<eos> - It was good.<eos> - What happened? I thought you knew how to drive those things.
We got rid of the body.<eos> We just have to get rid of the footage, that's all.<eos> - Right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yes. - Well, how?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Your house is so... - Funky.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You should see our panic room.
If we got this on tape.<eos> You naughty girl.<eos> Actually, I noticed that you guys have these cameras outside and it's always been a fantasy of mine to get caught on a security camera, so...<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Is it okay that we're watching this?<eos> Yeah, we're watching for Blair. You know, for her safety.<eos> We're monitoring.<eos> - Man, Blair looks great.<eos> - Yeah, she looks great.<eos> You ready?
- Excuse me, what?<eos> - Yeah, they don't work, like she said.<eos> But we know that's not what this was about. Right?<eos> This was fantasy fulfillment.<eos> - Creating a mise en scène.<eos> - I'm sorry. Why...<eos> Why would someone have security cameras that don't work?<eos> They didn't charge us for the first three months. After that, we didn't want to pay for the service.<eos> You know, they keep out the riffraff.<eos> You'll just have to jerk off as the Italians do.
Say "friendtipede."<eos> Friendtipede!<eos> Cute.<eos> Yes! - Let's see it.<eos> - It's ridiculous.<eos> - Alice, stop. You look really pretty.<eos> - No, look!<eos> - Shit! Damn it! - Is that our guy?<eos> - Are you kidding me? - Shit!<eos> God, I thought you weighed him down.
- I am not... - Get your hands against the wall!<eos> I am taking a passive stance.<eos> My body is limp for you!<eos> Spread them.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Now we have a dead guy and an unconscious cop?<eos> - What is wrong with you?<eos> - Are you kidding me? He's obviously a rape cop.<eos> This is what they do!<eos> When they have dirt on you, they sexually assault you, knowing you won't report it.
Thank you for pressing two.<eos> Your card has been suspended due to unusual activity. No.<eos> - How's that?<eos> - Yeah, that's good.<eos> If you're looking for our cell phones, I locked them in this drawer and I'm not gonna open it, okay?<eos> Please let me at least text Peter.<eos> I feel like he's totally freaking out right now.<eos> Not until everything is sorted out.<eos> We made a plan.<eos> - What's up, dude? What are you doing? - What?
All right.<eos> Hey, thanks a lot, man.<eos> - For you.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> So, I got meth.<eos> You looking?<eos> 40 bucks.<eos> No, thank you so much.<eos> I just need gas money.<eos> Hey, listen, do you want to suck my dick for 15 bucks?
Do you have any meth?<eos> - I could sell you meth, yeah.<eos> - 80 bucks.<eos> There you go.<eos> - Hey, man.<eos> I want to buy some meth.<eos> Only thing is, though, you got to do a little bump, though, so I know that you're not a cop.<eos> No, man. Please.<eos> I'm not a cop.<eos> You want the meth or not?
You got to do it, man.<eos> That's true love.<eos> Guys, I fell asleep.<eos> I had this nightmare where we had all killed a guy.<eos> - That is a reality. - No, we killed somebody.<eos> What?<eos> Jet lag is insane, you guys.<eos> It's no joke!<eos> No joke! Damn it!<eos> Did you happen to come up with a be-genius idea out there?
We should turn ourselves in. We're guilty.<eos> No, we are innocent, because this was an accident, you guys.<eos> Stop saying that.<eos> Maybe if you hadn't been lethally horny, we wouldn't be in this mess.<eos> I was coked up because you bought us drugs.<eos> I didn't force you to do the drugs, Alice.<eos> And you know what, nobody's talking about how it was Blair's idea to get a stripper in the first place.<eos> Yeah, but you're never to blame, right?<eos> "Look at me, I'm Frankie. I live in a storage unit. - "I'm saving the world."<eos> You act like everybody's so stupid for not being a merciless asshole like you.
You act like everybody's so stupid for not being a merciless asshole like you.<eos> - I'm the asshole?<eos> - I mean, you're both kind of assholes.<eos> - Stay out of this.<eos> - Seriously.<eos> Maybe you're the asshole, Alice.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Excuse me, bitch?<eos> I'm a fucking sweetheart.<eos> Well, then why do you insist on calling me Kiwi even though I told you it was culturally insensitive?
- I'm the asshole?<eos> - I mean, you're both kind of assholes.<eos> - Stay out of this.<eos> - Seriously.<eos> Maybe you're the asshole, Alice.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Excuse me, bitch?<eos> I'm a fucking sweetheart.<eos> Well, then why do you insist on calling me Kiwi even though I told you it was culturally insensitive?<eos> And why did you feel the need to reach over and try to undo my seat belt in the taxicab on the way here?
- Jesus Christ.<eos> That's an American bit.<eos> We do it as a joke. Okay?<eos> We all do it. Right?<eos> - Oh, my God, stop it, please.<eos> It's bad enough without you two going at it.<eos> And I thought your bridal shower was a nightmare.<eos> What are you talking about? She didn't have a bridal shower.<eos> No, she didn't.<eos> You had a bridal shower?
No, she didn't.<eos> You had a bridal shower?<eos> Well, not really. I mean...<eos> It was, like, work friends.<eos> It wasn't a big deal.<eos> But Blair went?<eos> It wasn't even open bar.<eos> What?<eos> It wasn't.<eos> How could you not invite me?
Alice, please. Please, can we drop it?<eos> Please. I'm telling you, it was just...<eos> It was for Peter's family. - It wasn't a big deal, man.<eos> - Peter.<eos> He is so annoying.<eos> And I know why he doesn't like me.<eos> 'Cause he's, like, so freaking jealous.<eos> Peter is not jealous of you.<eos> Well, then, why would you not invite your best friend to your bridal shower?<eos> - Oh, my God, you really want to know why?

God, you are so ungrateful.<eos> - Did you just say I was ungrateful?<eos> - Yes!<eos> You're an ungrateful person.

- Are you shitting me?<eos> We're heroes!<eos> We're American heroes.<eos> - Thank you, universe. - Jesus!<eos> We killed a guy!<eos> And it was right!<eos> We were right to kill him!<eos> Fuck, yeah!<eos> Hey, Jess. We're not going to jail.<eos> I still might be, for unrelated things, but you're not, you're safe.
Tampon!<eos> - What?<eos> - Blair.<eos> - What?<eos> - I need a tampon.<eos> I thought you use David cups.<eos> - No, never.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> Only tampons, the best of tampons!<eos> You took them from us.
- Blair.<eos> - What?<eos> - I need a tampon.<eos> I thought you use David cups.<eos> - No, never.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> Only tampons, the best of tampons!<eos> You took them from us.<eos> - What?<eos> - And locked them in there, - and you have the key.

I locked away our...<eos> Are we on the same page, Blair?<eos> - Yo, yo. Lady, you want to get your friend a tampon or whatever?
- Playtime's over.<eos> - We want those fucking diamonds now. - Look.<eos> I know you're mad at the 1%.<eos> - I am, too.<eos> - What? Shut up!<eos> - Tie them up now.<eos> Jess, when I was growing up, I didn't really have many friends.<eos> And when I left for college, my mom was worried about me.<eos> And so was I.<eos> But then we met, and the first night we went out, you didn't introduce me to people as your roommate, you introduced me as your friend.

Thanks to you.<eos> I can't wait to show her all the photos from this weekend.<eos> You were there for me, and I will always be here for you.

There are some wet wipes in here, because I ordered an ice cream cake and I know you have issues with dairy.
Sir, I could wire you $50,000 right now if you just let us go, okay?<eos> 50,000 what?<eos> There's over $2 million worth of diamonds in this house, and I am going to find them.<eos> You shoot anyone who moves.<eos> Don't make a fucking sound or I will kill you.<eos> Handcuff yourself to the sink.<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> - Now.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> You don't know anything?
Don't make a fucking sound or I will kill you.<eos> Handcuff yourself to the sink.<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> - Now.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> You don't know anything?<eos> Well, that smells like bullshit.<eos> Hurry up, man!<eos> Do I look stupid to you?<eos> You expect me to believe that you killed Jay by accident?
- Well, it could help, right?<eos> Next time we see each other, we can make new memories instead of just talking about the old ones.<eos> These zip ties are really starting to hurt.<eos> And I'm sorry about Peter, okay?<eos> He does not suck.<eos> You should totally marry him.<eos> - Well, I will.<eos> - Good. You should.<eos> I mean, I had a sex dream about him, and I didn't even tell you.<eos> No, you actually did tell me.
- Is that Peter?<eos> - You guys, what's happening back there?<eos> I can't see.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> Do you not like my dick?<eos> What?<eos> Does it bend weird when it gets hard, or, like...<eos> - I don't know, is it...<eos> - What? No, I love it.<eos> So, you still want to get married?
Does it bend weird when it gets hard, or, like...<eos> - I don't know, is it...<eos> - What? No, I love it.<eos> So, you still want to get married?<eos> Yes.<eos> More than ever I want to get married.<eos> I love you.<eos> I want that.<eos> Let's just get married. Let's get married this weekend.<eos> Well, what about the campaign? Didn't you want to wait till after the election, and...
- What about your parents?<eos> - My parents aren't gonna care.<eos> I mean, my mom did say to lock that down as soon as possible.<eos> - She did?<eos> - She loves you.<eos> - I love you.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> - Let's do it.<eos> I have the perfect place.<eos> Do you, Jessica, take Peter to be your husband?
- I love you.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> - Let's do it.<eos> I have the perfect place.<eos> Do you, Jessica, take Peter to be your husband?<eos> I do.<eos> And do you, Peter, take Jessica to be your wife?<eos> I definitely do.<eos> Now, by the power vested in me by GetOrdainedNow.net, I pronounce you husband and wife.<eos> You may kiss the groom.
Cool.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Has anyone ever told you how beautiful your feet are?<eos> No one's ever said that to me before.<eos> You should've been told that a million times.<eos> Do you want to... - Fuck? - Fuck?<eos> Keep it moving. We're a thing.<eos> Love wins.<eos> What'd you just say?

I mean, who knows if it will work out?<eos> And I don't know how you're gonna get to New York. I guess hitchhike, but...<eos> I already have my bags packed, actually, so...<eos> Well, just 'cause I'm between places...<eos> Shut up.<eos> Babe. It's for you.<eos> - Jess, it's me.<eos> That story about you and your friends taking out those criminals is everywhere!<eos> Okay? We're getting donations and volunteers.<eos> - Jess, you're gonna win this thing.
You're getting married?<eos> Jess, I'm in love with you.<eos> - Take a picture of us? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Cool!<eos> - I love you guys.<eos> - We love you.<eos> Can I see?<eos> - Another one? - One more.<eos> - I love it. - That, I love.<eos> - Alice, you can tag me.
Congratulations to State Senator Jess Thayer!<eos> My number one boss bitch!<eos> And now to celebrate her win, we have a special request.<eos> Me?<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I actually have a surprise for all of you.<eos> I've written a song that I hope can sort of encapsulate the bond of friendship that we all have.<eos> And so, I want to play it for you now.<eos> Sometimes<eos> You kill a man

This bachelorette<eos> This bachelorette<eos> That's the end.<eos> Do you guys want to come up?<eos> No, no, no. Don't come up. Don't come up.<eos> So, I will see you at Nussbaum's at 10:00.<eos> No, no. 12:30.<eos> - I don't want to get up.<eos> Okay, you guys, go. Go, go, go.<eos> We want to make sure that you get in okay.
What's out there?<eos> You scared me.
What's out there?<eos> You scared me.<eos> I'm gonna have to tie a bell around your neck so you don't keep sneaking up on me.
What's out there?<eos> You scared me.<eos> I'm gonna have to tie a bell around your neck so you don't keep sneaking up on me.<eos> What do you look at in the ocean?
What's out there?<eos> You scared me.<eos> I'm gonna have to tie a bell around your neck so you don't keep sneaking up on me.<eos> What do you look at in the ocean?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You spend a lot of time staring at nothing.
Mostly it's vast.<eos> It's full of life, mystery.<eos> Who knows what lies out there beneath the surface?<eos> Monsters?<eos> Monsters?<eos> Dreams. Sunken treasure.<eos> It's the great unknown.<eos> That's what the ocean is.<eos> I don't wanna go, Mom.<eos> I know you don't, but you have to.
- Brave. - We're gonna be so brave.<eos> Good job.<eos> - Mom, why did we move here?<eos> - Ziggy.<eos> I don't have time for this this morning.<eos> Please put your shirt on.<eos> Why did we move here?<eos> - Why?<eos> - That's enough.<eos> You can finish that in the car. Let's go.

Let's go.<eos> I don't mean to do your job, but it begs the question... is she running from something?<eos> You cannot be serious, Joseph.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> No. This makes us look like cowards.<eos> If you roll over on this, it sets a precedent...<eos> Do not yell at me.<eos> You're the one... honey, can you turn that down, please?<eos> Do you understand the precedent that you'd be setting?
You're the one... honey, can you turn that down, please?<eos> Do you understand the precedent that you'd be setting?<eos> Don't yell at me.<eos> You know what? I'm a lady and I've never said this to anybody, ever, in my entire life, but I'm gonna say it to you.<eos> You can go fuck yourself on the head.<eos> Right on the head?<eos> I'm sorry, but he's trying to shut down "Avenue Q." He says it's too controversial.<eos> Well, what's he want to replace it with?<eos> Don't tell me "Cats."<eos> You remember your first day of school?
Well, what's he want to replace it with?<eos> Don't tell me "Cats."<eos> You remember your first day of school?<eos> I do, actually.<eos> I got asked out on a date by a second-grader, no less.<eos> Did we accept?<eos> He wore white Docksiders.<eos> I'm sorry about last night.<eos> The idea of a bully in the class...<eos> I don't think he's a bully, but you're probably right. We should err on the side of safety.
- They've got it down to a science.<eos> - We don't go in?<eos> - No, we just drop them off.<eos> They can't be bothered with the parents now.<eos> What, so we don't get to meet the teachers?<eos> We did all that yesterday at orientation.<eos> They go right into class today. Don't you?<eos> Big boys.<eos> Max, look what the witch gives me.<eos> That's not something you could've mentioned?

You could've told me that Orientation Day was...<eos> Don't.<eos> This is my friend, Ziggy.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - We're half-sisters, sort of.<eos> My mom was married to her dad.<eos> Hi, Chloe.<eos> Hey, mama bear.<eos> - I'm going to yoga class.<eos> You wanna join me?
Don't worry about him, honey.<eos> He's gonna be fine.<eos> I promise.<eos> Get laid, bitch.<eos> See you later.<eos> Maybe it was inappropriate, handing out invites on the first day, but Renata's a planner.<eos> Renata was sending a message.<eos> I was thinking you could do it.<eos> I don't practice anymore. I can't.<eos> I know, but you could come out of retirement just this one time so you can safeguard all of the arts for Monterey.
I'll leave it at that.<eos> I thought your flight was at 5:00.<eos> Well, traffic might be bad.<eos> It's 11:30.<eos> Thank you. Good to know.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> I changed my flight so I could be here on their first day of school.<eos> And then I don't even get to go in the building.<eos> I understand, but I just...<eos> And for you to just dismiss my being upset about it?

I'm so sorry, honey.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's just... fuck.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You know, all... it's just all this traveling... I feel like I'm missing out on so much.<eos> They'll be grown one day, and I just...<eos> Sorry. Sorry, sorry.<eos> I love you.<eos> There you go.
There you go.<eos> Let me go.<eos> God!<eos> Perry and Celeste?<eos> Honestly... I'd sleep with either.<eos> Call "The Wall Street Journal" and tell them we make a deal now with these guys, or they're never gonna have anybody by them.<eos> No, this is ridiculous!<eos> Juliette?<eos> Because my daughter's got to get picked up. Sorry, I'm distra... yes.<eos> You need to get in the car right now and pick up... hold on one second.
- Good.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Teacher's nice. - She is?<eos> That's amazing.<eos> That's so great.<eos> What's that?<eos> Amabella's having a party.<eos> That's sweet.<eos> I didn't get invited.<eos> Honey, you don't know her very well.
- Will you please? - What?<eos> Chloe.<eos> Abby, come on.<eos> This is so Renata.<eos> On the very first day of school?<eos> Well, if she's convinced that this Ziggy poses a threat to her daughter's safety, of course he's not gonna get invited.<eos> I'm just saying that distributing the invitations in the classroom to the exception of one person... I mean, it's just unacceptable.<eos> Thank you, honey.<eos> This looks delicious.<eos> Abby, are you dating the fridge?
Abby, are you dating the fridge?<eos> Chloe, I set up a standing playdate with you and Ziggy on Thursdays.<eos> Cool.<eos> - Are you sure that's a good idea?<eos> - Why would it not be?<eos> We don't know for a fact that he's innocent.<eos> Maybe the benefit of the doubt should run in Chloe's favor instead of Ziggy.<eos> Are you suggesting I might be putting my daughter in harm's way?<eos> You mean our daughter?<eos> Chloe, I don't know why you didn't text me or call me when the snub happened.
You really shouldn't encourage her to play with dolls.<eos> And why is that, exactly?<eos> It's a little 1960s, not to mention sexist.<eos> - Is it a Barbie doll?<eos> - You can't put a phone in a Barbie, dummy.<eos> Barbies aren't allowed anyways. Sylvie Baker's gave Joey Proccacini a boner.<eos> You know, Abigail, I am super impressed with your emerging social conscience. - I really am.<eos> - Shall we leave it at that? Or is now the time to pile on Bonnie?<eos> I just have a very low tolerance for injustice, which is exactly what's going on with Ziggy and his mom.<eos> You fled the table when Abby brought up Bonnie.
When I was married to him, he wouldn't so much as go for a walk.<eos> And when he finally did, he never came back.<eos> - Remember that big fight I promised?<eos> - I think now would be a good time.<eos> - Why?<eos> Is Nathan the one?<eos> What do you... what do you mean?<eos> - The one.<eos> For every person, there's the one.<eos> Case in point, you're my one.

I don't get to be crazy, Madeline.<eos> I'm stable, I'm grounded.<eos> Good ol' steady Eddie, that's me.<eos> Where is this coming from?<eos> It's coming from the fact that you don't really seem to adore me, that you're rarely interested in having sex, but specifically today, it's coming from your constant carrying on about Nathan and his seemingly perfect life,

And I am fucking sick of it.<eos> Look, I may not be the good-looking adventure ride, okay? But there is something to be said for being there, for being truthful, for being somebody you can steadfastly count on.

Charlie Manson.<eos> You okay?<eos> He's scared.<eos> Scared?<eos> What are you scared of?
- Yeah, maybe.<eos> Just have to ask your dad.<eos> Hey, wanna meet me at Side Door?<eos> I need to swap out my family for some vodka.<eos> Is your nanny there? - Yeah.<eos> She is, actually.<eos> - Great, I'll see you then.<eos> I think they both had drinking problems. I do.<eos> Well, I'm happy to let you post it, but nobody really reads these flyers.<eos> And if you wanna get work these days, you need a website.
Well, I'm happy to let you post it, but nobody really reads these flyers.<eos> And if you wanna get work these days, you need a website.<eos> I know, it's just so expensive.<eos> It's not as much as you think.<eos> Madeline's husband Ed is in web design. He could help you put something together.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I already have an accountant, but otherwise, I would...<eos> It's all good.<eos> No, I would.<eos> Do you have any clients?
Mom.<eos> The chocolate one?<eos> Okay, but I'm eating some.<eos> We are looking at the victim's relationships with every parent who attended Trivia Night.<eos> "Is Nathan the one?"<eos> Of course not!<eos> That he doubts my love for him?<eos> And Ed's not a neurotic guy, so maybe it is me.<eos> Maybe I'm just lousy at conveying how much I...<eos> You once said that you two don't have sex very often.
So, the sex that you have is like...<eos> Hi, Celeste, Madeline!<eos> - How are you? - Hi, Renata.<eos> I was over there with my girlfriends, getting our drink on, and I saw you two.<eos> - Do you have a second?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Did you know that they're thinking about closing down the local V.A. hospital?<eos> It means that vets are having to drive all the way to Sacramento for their services, which is so upsetting.<eos> I've really dedicated a lot of my life to vets, specifically PTSD, so I'm gonna hold a little, you know, fundraising dinner party and help defray costs and keep the facility open.<eos> It would be so great if you and Perry could come.

It would be so nice.<eos> You're such a kind person, Renata.
What a cunt.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Why don't you get fucked?<eos> The war is on.<eos> You know, this really isn't fair to Chloe.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Last year, Amabella had a jumping castle and a magician.<eos> This year only figures to be better.<eos> Please.<eos> For you to summarily say she can't go, then use her as a tool to get other kids not to go...
Excuse me?<eos> Last year, Amabella had a jumping castle and a magician.<eos> This year only figures to be better.<eos> Please.<eos> For you to summarily say she can't go, then use her as a tool to get other kids not to go...<eos> I am not doing that.<eos> You know, one minute it's Nathan or Bonnie. Now Renata, not to mention the parking monitor, the girls in the car.<eos> I can't even keep track of all the fights you start.<eos> Somebody needs to invent an app.<eos> Well, maybe you could have my back in some of them.

Now Renata, not to mention the parking monitor, the girls in the car.<eos> I can't even keep track of all the fights you start.<eos> Somebody needs to invent an app.<eos> Well, maybe you could have my back in some of them.<eos> What is it about this Jane?<eos> What is she, a long-lost sister or something?<eos> - Just a cause in lieu of...<eos> - In lieu of what?<eos> In lieu of a life?<eos> Is that what you were gonna say?
In lieu of a life?<eos> Is that what you were gonna say?<eos> Jane's a single mom.<eos> Do you need an app to put two and two together?<eos> When Abigail was a little baby,<eos> Nathan was not around and I was a single mom, Ed.<eos> And I'm still angry about it.<eos> It's not my love for Nathan that lingers after 15 years, it's my resentment.<eos> There's a big difference.<eos> Did you hear me?
- Don't worry. - Right.<eos> - Let me call you right back. - But I...<eos> Chloe, get in the car.<eos> Chloe, get in the car right now. What?<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> I'm not having sex, I promise you.<eos> What are those pills?<eos> They're just for in case, you know, the day comes.<eos> Not that it's coming any time soon, but I just have them.<eos> You are 16 years old.

- From a doctor.<eos> - Dr. Ennis?<eos> She wrote you a prescription without calling me?<eos> Not her. I went to Planned Parenthood.<eos> Please don't make a big deal about this.<eos> I'm not sexually active, okay?<eos> Who took you there?<eos> - What?<eos> - Planned Parenthood. Did you take a car, an Uber? Did somebody give you a ride?<eos> How did you get there?
- Love you.<eos> Bye.<eos> - Stay in the car.<eos> - Ma'am! I'm just gonna be a minute.<eos> Bonnie?<eos> Bonnie, can I talk to you for just a second?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - A couple of things.<eos> First of all, I'm happy that Abigail has bonded with your mother. Thrilled about the communal potato peeling thing.<eos> But when it comes to my daughter's social recreational life, particularly as it concerns medications that will permanently affect her reproductive organs, will you just kick that little can of worms over to me?
- Do you understand? - I do.<eos> And should Skye come to me 10 years down the road and ask for a little lift to Planned Parenthood, I would give you that courtesy call first. Thanks.<eos> - Ma'am!<eos> - I'm dropping off my kid!<eos> Come on, Chloe.<eos> Don't give my daughter...<eos> That's my daughter.<eos> Next time you wanna do something... why don't I take your daughter?<eos> Your daughter?<eos> Do whatever you want to her.
- I'll see what I can do.<eos> - Thank you. Yeah, I guess... I guess Shakespeare got it wrong.<eos> "The play's the thing" unless it has puppets.<eos> Exactly!<eos> See, he understands me.<eos> Unfortunately, gay.<eos> Really?<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Yes!<eos> - You're sure of that?
Kind of like landscaping, I guess. Growth business.<eos> That's... that's clever.<eos> Um, hey, thanks for meeting me.<eos> I just want to discuss this whole thing with, like... that happened with Bonnie and Abby.<eos> Sure.<eos> You know, as far as I can tell, there was no undue influence or interference.<eos> Like, Abby asked Bonnie some questions about Planned Parenthood, Bonnie answered them. Abby then asked Bonnie to drive her there.<eos> There was no parental usurps of any kind, I promise you that.<eos> But I can discuss that whole thing with Maddie. What I wanted to take up with you is...<eos> I think you can probably appreciate that it's a bit of a delicate balancing act with my ex.

It was pretty tough when you left.

Maybe I'm talking out of turn here.<eos> No, I was young, you know?<eos> Maybe a bit of a shit.<eos> But I made some real mistakes with both Maddie and Abby, but should I be required to make the same mistakes with Bonnie and Skye?<eos> No, but, you know, doesn't hurt to be mindful of other people's feelings sometimes.

You do almost 50-50 in the childcare. You even cook.

I thought it'd be indelicate to bring it up with Maddie. That's why I'm bringing it up with you.<eos> Well, that sounded like a threat, Nathan.<eos> Are you threatening me?

You know, this thing with that Ziggy kid, all the talk of bullying?<eos> I was bullied. Sixth grade.<eos> And I always turned the other cheek, thinking that was the more mature thing to do.<eos> Some 30 years later, it still haunts me that I didn't beat the shit out of that kid.<eos> So much so, I find myself fantasizing that somebody will come along one day and say or do something to me that'll offer me the chance to redeem myself.<eos> You've always treated me quite well, Nathan.<eos> It's too bad.<eos> Too bad.<eos> The first thing I said, the very first thing I said... "It wasn't just the mothers."<eos> I'm gonna kick your fucking ass if you fucking talk to me like that again, you fucking little shit.
- Is he denying it? He's suggesting we pick something more community-centric.<eos> Joseph, we have worked so hard for this, and we are being victimized by the small-mindedness led by the likes of Renata Klein.<eos> Understood, but we need to pick our battles, and this is just...<eos> And sometimes our battles pick us. We can't quit.<eos> We just can't.<eos> Is this about the play or winning?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe it's a little bit about both.<eos> But I get sick and tired of the morally superior in this town stepping all over everybody else.<eos> And you said you wanted to be brave with your artistic direction.

The boys are waiting for me downstairs.<eos> Yeah, well, I have to help myself go to sleep.<eos> You need to help me help myself.<eos> Do I, now?<eos> Let me just look at my gorgeous wife for a second.<eos> Ten seconds.<eos> I'll give you five.<eos> Wow, make it a nice five.<eos> Okay, that's enough, naughty boy.<eos> You'll have to come home sooner if you want more.

She didn't do anything.<eos> I just don't think legal action is the answer, all right?<eos> Let's see how it goes. I'm guessing it'll all sort itself out.<eos> I do not feel supported here.<eos> I don't suppose I could argue with your feelings.<eos> Ziggy, why are you awake?

Building a better Texas.<eos> Now, from your 24-hour news service, this is Good Morning Austin.<eos> People in the Southwest are looking for relief from a deadly heat wave.<eos> A few areas, like Fort Worth, Texas, and parts of Oklahoma, saw rain Monday for the first time in a long time.<eos> But for most, the month-long drought continues.<eos> NBC's Cummins reports.<eos> You've reached the Murray O'Hairs.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> Hey, it's Luke.<eos> It's, uh, 10:00. Where are you?
Hey, y'all.<eos> Gonna be a scorcher today.<eos> - Where are we?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Grandma?<eos> It's all right, Red.<eos> We're gonna get out of this.<eos> - Garth?<eos> - Yes, Mother.<eos> Did you get a good look at anybody?
We're gonna get out of this.<eos> - Garth?<eos> - Yes, Mother.<eos> Did you get a good look at anybody?<eos> Recognize anyone?<eos> No, Mother.<eos> Check their restraints.<eos> You wanna tell us what the hell we're doin' here?<eos> Shut up.<eos> You're tellin' me to shut up?
- Garth?<eos> - Yes, Mother.<eos> Did you get a good look at anybody?<eos> Recognize anyone?<eos> No, Mother.<eos> Check their restraints.<eos> You wanna tell us what the hell we're doin' here?<eos> Shut up.<eos> You're tellin' me to shut up?<eos> I don't think you know whose weeds you're pissing in, buddy.
I loosened it. Come here. Give me your hands.<eos> Give me your hands.<eos> - What are you... - Give me your hands.<eos> Just get it untied.<eos> That's... - I... I can't.<eos> - You can do it.<eos> - Oh, my God. It's really...<eos> - That's it.<eos> That's it. What kind of knot is that?<eos> Come on. You can do it.
I knew I should have sent you to fucking Boy Scouts.<eos> I don't know what you think you're gonna do anyway.<eos> They both have guns.<eos> If we could get these hoods off, we might have a better idea of what we're dealing with.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Try again.<eos> - No. - Come on, Garthy...<eos> - No, stop it.<eos> Don't you disobey your mother!<eos> Or what, you're gonna take me over your knee?
- No, stop it.<eos> Don't you disobey your mother!<eos> Or what, you're gonna take me over your knee?<eos> - Yes, I just might...<eos> - Stop it, both of you!<eos> God damn it, I have to pee.<eos> Hey, people!<eos> If you don't let me out of here, I'm gonna piss all over your floor!<eos> Lady, you're gonna need to calm down.<eos> Calm down? You want me to calm down, shit for brains?
What's going on?<eos> Garth, what's going on?<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Robin.<eos> Oh, my God, is that who I think it is?<eos> Fuck.<eos> Hello, Madalyn.<eos> - This is Bill Murray.<eos> - Bill, it's Roy. Roy Collier.<eos> What do you want?
What do you want?<eos> It's your mom... and Robin and Garth.<eos> They've disappeared.<eos> I just saw them in Dallas.<eos> I'm not kidding.<eos> The police said that in order for somebody to officially be considered missing, they need somebody in the family to file a report.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Besides, they're probably off on some crazy trip again.<eos> - No, this is different, Bill.<eos> - Roy... you know they're not in my life anymore.
And, frankly, I'd like to keep it that way.<eos> Okay?<eos> Bill...<eos> Ferguson...<eos> I need those 600 words on the Alamo anniversary by 5:00.<eos> Relax, man.<eos> It's the same story I wrote last year and the year before that.<eos> Well, can't help it if nothing ever happens in San Antonio.<eos> No, plenty happens in San Antonio. I just don't get to write about it.<eos> Where you going?
But I gotta go.<eos> If you wanna know more, come by 1682 Greystone Drive tonight.<eos> - What...<eos> - I'll be there.<eos> Hello?<eos> Madalyn?<eos> Bless this food to our use... and us to thy service.<eos> - Amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> Now, I don't suppose you found a job today?
- I'll be there.<eos> Hello?<eos> Madalyn?<eos> Bless this food to our use... and us to thy service.<eos> - Amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> Now, I don't suppose you found a job today?<eos> I had an interview.<eos> But I didn't get a law degree to be a damn receptionist.<eos> You'd be lucky to be someone's receptionist.

I was just trying to make a point about your momma, huh?<eos> I've got a point I'd like to make.<eos> What else is new?<eos> No, this is important.<eos> Got an announcement.<eos> Getting another grandchild.<eos> That's right. Your precious daughter's got herself knocked up again.<eos> - Oh, honey, no.<eos> - Yeah. And the guy's kicked me to the curb again, saying it's not his, when I know for a fact it absolutely is his.<eos> You're an embarrassment.
- Oh, honey, no.<eos> - Yeah. And the guy's kicked me to the curb again, saying it's not his, when I know for a fact it absolutely is his.<eos> You're an embarrassment.<eos> That's right. That's right.<eos> Walk away.<eos> Just like they did.<eos> I'm sorry, Mother.<eos> - You wanna tell me what happened?<eos> - I don't know. Condom broke?<eos> You sure you wanna keep it?
- Yeah. And the guy's kicked me to the curb again, saying it's not his, when I know for a fact it absolutely is his.<eos> You're an embarrassment.<eos> That's right. That's right.<eos> Walk away.<eos> Just like they did.<eos> I'm sorry, Mother.<eos> - You wanna tell me what happened?<eos> - I don't know. Condom broke?<eos> You sure you wanna keep it?<eos> I mean, I can take care of Pup, and you know how he loves little Bill, and hopefully he'll come around.

I get plenty of that.<eos> Maddy, you made a couple of mistakes, that's all.

- Noncon...<eos> - Nonconformist?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Well, you could say that, I guess.<eos> White Tower won't serve Negroes... so they're protesting.<eos> And if they protest, will that make the White Tower serve them?<eos> No, the owners of that place are damn racists.<eos> Makes me so mad.<eos> I bet they call themselves Christians, too.<eos> Grandpa says you might find a job if you were more Christian.

Why are you here?

Now you be good for Grandma, right, Garth?<eos> You can find everything that you've been searching for in Christ.<eos> And I'd better not come home and find my son watching that claptrap with you.<eos> I don't want him getting any ideas.<eos> I'm gonna get in trouble again.<eos> Well, it's not my fault you missed the bus.<eos> Okay. All right, I'll talk to the teacher if I have to, okay?<eos> Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name...<eos> - We are not making a habit of this.<eos> - I know. - You've gotta start getting up earlier. - I know.
That's what's in our personal account.<eos> What?<eos> Where is the rest of it?<eos> It's in dummy trusts.<eos> It's in dummy what now?<eos> They have to wire it here, the 600 grand, from New Zealand next week.<eos> Next week?<eos> And I have to sign for it in person.<eos> Hey...<eos> Are you lying?

Go to hell, commies!<eos> No one wants you.<eos> - You go to hell!<eos> - Go, go, go!<eos> Madalyn!<eos> Come on.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> The kids at school?<eos> - Mmm. - I can handle it.<eos> - Oh, you think so?
And there are plenty of people who'd just as soon never see that woman in Texas again.<eos> Well, can I at least have a follow-up?<eos> Right now, I need a story on the transit board's bus route overhaul.<eos> Thanks, buddy.<eos> This is all they had.<eos> I think you look pretty hot.<eos> Hey, Gary, ever occur to you that your sole purpose in life might be to serve as an argument for birth control?<eos> You know what? Just... Just ignore her.<eos> There you are.<eos> A little overcooked, just like you like them.
- Hey, hey, hey! - Oh, go ahead and shoot me.<eos> I'm an awfully big body to hide.<eos> - Gary, put the gun away.<eos> - Open up, Grandma!<eos> - Keep talking.<eos> - Gary... - No, be funny, fucking Grandma. Do it!<eos> - Please!<eos> Gary, please.<eos> Not so tough now, huh?<eos> You're gonna owe me.
I know, but if we get the police involved, you know that the IRS is gonna follow.<eos> And what they want, it's nothing.<eos> So let's just play their game for now, and we'll figure out a way to nail them later.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, he's right, Grandma.<eos> Yeah, he's right.<eos> This one time.<eos> Stop gloating.<eos> That's not good.<eos> It's fine. They think they're in New Zealand.<eos> You said two days, tops.
Robin would never leave her.<eos> And Garth?<eos> Yeah, Garth can't piss without his mom holding his dick.<eos> Four days.<eos> We get the money. We get out of town.<eos> Here.<eos> Get rid of the cars.<eos> Just to be safe.<eos> David...<eos> When this thing comes through, you're not really serious about letting them go, right?
Get rid of the cars.<eos> Just to be safe.<eos> David...<eos> When this thing comes through, you're not really serious about letting them go, right?<eos> He wants you to drop the story?<eos> Well, he doesn't think there's much more to tell.<eos> Everybody seems to believe they took off for New Zealand.<eos> I told you, they'd never leave<eos> - without the dogs. - "Without the dogs"?<eos> Yeah, you may have mentioned that before.

But it didn't matter.<eos> When my parents kicked me out... she was there to take me in.<eos> All right, look.<eos> I have a PI, owes me a favor, uh...<eos> Not promising anything, but I'll see if he can't dig something up.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Jesus, David.<eos> Just as vain as ever, huh?<eos> You sure you're not a homo?<eos> You are the last person who should be lecturing me about vanity.

- Goddamn Jesus Christ.<eos> - Uh, Mother.<eos> Oh. Oh, all right. Well, I'm sorry I used that language again, Susan.<eos> I'll try to clean it up a little bit.<eos> Mother, uh...<eos> Mother...<eos> - Susan and I have been talking.<eos> - Bill, no.<eos> Well, I haven't even said what I'm gonna ask yet.<eos> You wanna abandon me.
Mother, uh...<eos> Mother...<eos> - Susan and I have been talking.<eos> - Bill, no.<eos> Well, I haven't even said what I'm gonna ask yet.<eos> You wanna abandon me.<eos> Please.<eos> Bill, look at me.<eos> Some freak put me in the hospital.<eos> You're fine.

I have a wife and a child now.<eos> I'm not sure this is the life that I want for them.<eos> - Right, that's your decision.<eos> - All right.<eos> I just don't know if I can keep up what I'm doing without you.<eos> Oh. - Well, you got Richard now.<eos> - All he's good for is fucking.<eos> Mom.<eos> Remember that protest at White Tower?<eos> You couldn't have been more than ten.

And that day you said to me,<eos> "If something makes you really mad, you've gotta go out there and do something about it."<eos> All my life... I just wanted one person somewhere, sometime, to understand me.<eos> And that person turned out to be you.<eos> We're in this together.<eos> From Hollywood, The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.<eos> This is Ed McMahon along with Doc Severinsen and the NBC Orchestra inviting you to join Johnny and his guests...<eos> Roger Miller, Steve Martin and atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair.<eos> Yeah. No, I told you it's enough. Thank you.<eos> Where the hell have you been?
Windows were broken and tires slashed. I was shot at several times.<eos> Drove my poor mother to an early grave, I do believe.<eos> The center has a printing press, library and recording studio for her syndicated radio series.<eos> I do love a good fight.<eos> And taking on God and the church is... well, kind of the ultimate, isn't it?<eos> So, as long as there's a fight to be had, I'll still be a squeaky wheel.<eos> Well, there you have it, people.<eos> Now let's get something started!<eos> You watch and learn, Red, and one of these days you'll be running this whole goddamn place.<eos> Why don't you help Sandy with the mail? - Hmm?
Now let's get something started!<eos> You watch and learn, Red, and one of these days you'll be running this whole goddamn place.<eos> Why don't you help Sandy with the mail? - Hmm?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Where's your brother?<eos> I haven't seen him.<eos> Mother.<eos> 11:00 in the morning, you little shit.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> Is this the kind of example you wanna set for your daughter?

Okay?<eos> I'm sick and tired of living your life!<eos> What, you're gonna leave me? Like all the rest of 'em?
Oh, Jesus couldn't save himself.<eos> The New Testament?<eos> Oh, a load of bull written by a bunch of faggots.<eos> Oh, come on. Y'all know that.<eos> Jesus was as queer as a three-dollar bill.<eos> You dirty heathen!<eos> Let me see what that looks like.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, that's not bad.<eos> You were on fire out there tonight, darlin'.

I do.<eos> Why don't you let me see how the numbers are here?<eos> Oh, not bad.<eos> We'll do better in Kansas City.<eos> I'll burn the goddamn book in Kansas City.<eos> Oh, Praise the Lord!<eos> Thank you, Garth.<eos> I'll keep praying for your soul, Madalyn.<eos> I'll keep cursing yours.<eos> You think we won anyone over?
- Thanks, Mr. Sparrow.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> What kind of religious nut goes off and sells a stolen car?<eos> Well, maybe this isn't the work of a religious nut.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, Madalyn was stashing loads of cash, right?<eos> Mmm. Makes for the greatest motive of all.<eos> Greed.<eos> This is just like the old days.<eos> You used to let me win.

Greed.<eos> This is just like the old days.<eos> You used to let me win.<eos> You were the boss. I had to.<eos> Does that mean I'm supposed to let you win now?<eos> You do have the gun.<eos> And we all know what that means.<eos> Compensating for a very small cock.<eos> Right, Red?<eos> That's what you always say, Grandma.

I deserve it.<eos> You are so full of yourself, you can't see the fucking forest for the trees.

Another for 12.<eos> I know.<eos> In God we trust. Right?<eos> Good luck.<eos> Mmm, what's going on?<eos> The money made it out of New Zealand.<eos> It won't be long now.<eos> It's about time.<eos> The van's out back.<eos> Garth... you try anything... anything, Madalyn and Robin are dead.
No, I got it.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Bye, Mother.<eos> - You be careful, Garth. - Okay.<eos> You know those bills are gonna be marked.<eos> They're getting a cashier's check.<eos> Then we're using that to buy gold coins. Something that can't be traced.<eos> - Here you go, Grandma.<eos> - Thank you, darlin'.<eos> Well, it looks like you might have me here.

Wait a minute.<eos> Gin.<eos> You'll win next time.<eos> Yeah. Sure, I'll win one of these days.<eos> You've done a real good job here, David.<eos> But, uh...<eos> I want you to know I did some, uh... digging... into your record.<eos> True you were picked up for hustling?<eos> I told you I am trying to put all that behind me.<eos> I don't give a shit what you do with your pecker.

I was gonna teach this guy a lesson.<eos> But when I started with that tire iron...<eos> I don't know, I just...<eos> I lost control.<eos> I got 30 years, but I only did half.<eos> Got out for good behavior.<eos> And I swore I would never lose control again.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you for telling me the fucking truth.<eos> Yeah, you live long enough and you lose faith in people.

But... you have impressed me, David.<eos> Starting to wish Bill Jr. Could've turned out more like you.<eos> He really hurt you, huh?<eos> He betrayed me.<eos> That's what men do. Betray me.<eos> But, no, David, he didn't hurt me.<eos> Nobody can really hurt me.<eos> Now that I trust you, I wanna show you something.<eos> I'm giving you a promotion, David.<eos> So far, you've been keeping track of most of our donations in the official ledger book.

Oh, don't tell me it's another hiccup.<eos> We have to wait for another shipment of coins.<eos> What?<eos> They'll be here next Tuesday. Oh, for...<eos> This is getting ridiculous.<eos> Shut up.<eos> You're not in charge here.<eos> All right, I got it. I got it.<eos> You're the big boss.<eos> But God damn it, David, if you aren't fucking up this job like everything else you've ever done.
You know... if somebody did something to them... it's probably someone from that place.<eos> My mother pissed off a lot of people.<eos> Especially those she was closest to.<eos> Uh, excuse me, uh...<eos> I just want to say American Atheists has had a wonderful year, and... that would not be so without all of you.<eos> So, thank you, and a very happy winter solstice.<eos> Strike up the carols!<eos> Mother loves Christmas. She really, really does.<eos> Oh, and you in your sweater. So darling.<eos> - Will you get me a refill, Garthy?
See anybody laughing?<eos> No more for him, huh?<eos> Madalyn, sorry.<eos> I don't wanna hear your excuses.<eos> Right now, all I want out of you is breathing.<eos> Very little of that.<eos> Come on. I just had a little bit too much to drink.<eos> Oh, I am assuming it was the drink talking, otherwise I would fire your ass.<eos> What?<eos> You wanna get rid of me?

You think your son Bill hurt you?<eos> Nah.<eos> Not like I hurt her.<eos> Garth!<eos> David Waters is a convicted felon.<eos> He's a murderer.<eos> And his mother was a goddamn whore.<eos> And she's not the only one that sucked cocks for money.<eos> Isn't that right, David?<eos> Isn't that right? You sucked cock...
And she's not the only one that sucked cocks for money.<eos> Isn't that right, David?<eos> Isn't that right? You sucked cock...<eos> Don't fuck with me, Madalyn. Don't fuck with me.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Hello, football fans...<eos> We got beer, vodka, cigs.<eos> Finally.<eos> Hope you didn't forget about me, Danny.
Finally.<eos> Hope you didn't forget about me, Danny.<eos> No, I did not.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> Sorry it ain't a martini.<eos> Oh, it's the good stuff.<eos> Yeah.<eos> My Billy Boy... he used to mix a mean Manhattan.<eos> Here's to new friends.<eos> You're all right, Danny Fry.
Sorry it ain't a martini.<eos> Oh, it's the good stuff.<eos> Yeah.<eos> My Billy Boy... he used to mix a mean Manhattan.<eos> Here's to new friends.<eos> You're all right, Danny Fry.<eos> You know, I'm real sorry we're putting you through all this.<eos> It's not you. It's David.<eos> I'd watch your ass around him if I were you.<eos> You know, I trusted him.
Jack just called.<eos> He has the sketch of the guy who sold Garth's car.<eos> Who the fuck is that?<eos> Get out!<eos> This is Bob Fry. Leave a message.<eos> Hey, Bob, it's, uh... it's Danny.<eos> You know, I was actually just headed back to Florida just now, but, um... I've got a couple things I gotta tie up still here in Texas.<eos> So, uh...<eos> But I'm gonna be sending you a letter.<eos> And if you could just hang onto it for me, that would be great.

Bye.<eos> Garth?<eos> Yes, Mother?<eos> I know you don't like me very much.

Yeah.<eos> Well, you've called me worse.<eos> I suppose.<eos> It doesn't mean anything, you know that.<eos> What about you, Red?<eos> You hate me for taking you away from your father?<eos> You didn't take me away from him.<eos> I was too hard on him.<eos> I'm too hard on all of you.<eos> You're only hard on us because you believe we can be great.
It's getting a lot of hits lately.<eos> You should check it out.<eos> I don't recognize your authority.<eos> I don't recognize it.<eos> You afraid of, brother?<eos> You afraid of shining a light on some truth?<eos> Don't take my arm so tight.<eos> It's not necessary.<eos> Come on.<eos> You caved to a crazy man?
Choose another topic.<eos> Religion.<eos> See?<eos> We can't write about anything actually affecting us.<eos> Last week, you vetoed my story about the stranger danger sessions the school keeps holding.<eos> Because it's a direct criticism of the administration's policies.<eos> They hired experts to remind us not to let strangers touch us in our bathing suit areas.<eos> That's what they said, "our bathing suit areas."<eos> - Some kids my age are already having sex, and, I'm not...<eos> - Okay, you're just trying to cause a stir, and that's not what real journalism is.

I can't submit clips like these to a top-tier journalism school.<eos> Solomon, this isn't a debate, and you can't be in here.<eos> I'm sorry, but it's hypocritical...<eos> Hey, Ms. Nish.<eos> If you won't print my stories, then maybe I'll write a new one about freedom of speech in high schools.<eos> The Oregonian might be interested.<eos> Are you recording me?<eos> Just so I don't misquote you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You know what?
Oh, my God.<eos> You know what?<eos> Then on the record, I say,<eos> "Why don't you ask your stepfather about our school's policies?"<eos> Because he's on the school board that actually makes them.<eos> I'm sorry, but I can't help you.<eos> I can help you.<eos> Not easy being new.<eos> Takes time to make friends.<eos> Have you thought about a sport?

I can't help with that.<eos> ♪ For I know that I'll never ♪<eos> ♪ Live happily ever after ♪<eos> ♪ 'Til after I'm a bride ♪<eos> Too forte at the end?<eos> "Forte" means loud, in musical terms.<eos> I'll teach you all the terms.

I can't choose any of these topics.<eos> Then follow the rules, or you can leave.<eos> I'm sorry, but I don't have time for this every week.<eos> Great choice.<eos> Hey. I was wondering if I could interview you for an article I'm writing about the auditions... for the school paper.<eos> I'm Solomon.<eos> We're friends on Facebook.<eos> I've liked a lot of your Instagram posts. Hey.<eos> Seriously, Mark?<eos> You know, I was once upon your mattress.
We're friends on Facebook.<eos> I've liked a lot of your Instagram posts. Hey.<eos> Seriously, Mark?<eos> You know, I was once upon your mattress.<eos> Okay, everyone, just remember, in the words of Stanislavski,<eos> "there are no small parts, only small actors."<eos> - I got it.<eos> - I knew it.<eos> Yay!<eos> I knew you would.
- I knew it.<eos> Yay!<eos> I knew you would.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey.<eos> I was wondering if I could interview you about these auditions.<eos> For the school paper?<eos> It's time for North Salem to have a GSA.<eos> My old school had one, and most schools in Oregon do, so don't think I'm asking for some kind of fringe thing or whatever.<eos> Well, look, I-I'm proud of you... uh, that you have spoken your mind.
- Mom, Mom, just...<eos> It's very true.<eos> Let's at least have a discussion about it.<eos> No, we'll just put it to a vote.<eos> Well, it's yes from me.<eos> Uh... Nope for me.<eos> Of course, yes.<eos> No.<eos> James.<eos> Where are you on the... On this issue?

Don't worry.<eos> I'm not worried.<eos> Okay, if we could all get into a circle...<eos> This year's debate topic is...<eos> Resolved.<eos> When in conflict, an individual's freedom of speech should be valued over a community's moral standards.<eos> In a year with our mayor...<eos> He's in trouble, and...<eos> With the school censoring our newspaper articles, this is pretty relevant, yeah?<eos> Solomon, you're freaking people out.
- to direct traffic.<eos> - Oh, my gosh. Diwata.<eos> We're leaving. We're leaving.<eos> Every guy in school has a boner for her.<eos> Oh, you, too?<eos> Great ass, right?<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> After one baby, it'll sink to the floor, but she won't stop singing, and you'll be stuck listening to that off-key screeching everywhere.<eos> The car, the shower.<eos> - Is that really what you want?

So you want to know about Speech and Debate?<eos> I wish...<eos> I wish...<eos> I whiff.<eos> Someone's been wishing for fun, friends, and new adventures.<eos> Well, I have the epitome of success for all promising high schoolers.<eos> Speech and Debate?<eos> But I'm interested in talking about things affecting our country right now.<eos> Well, Gideon, your wish is granted.<eos> Since you are such a skilled writer, why not try Persuasive Speaking?

Solomon.<eos> I saw Goody Osborn with the Devil.<eos> I saw Bridget Bishop with the Devil.<eos> I saw Goody Hawkins with the Devil.<eos> Looks like you're having an orgasm while getting murdered.
- Come at me!<eos> - Oh, whoa. Hey.<eos> The school board needs to<eos> - stop shielding students<eos> - Eyes.<eos> - From meaningful discussions<eos> - Hands. Where are your hands?<eos> About abortion, religion, sex...<eos> - Your spirit animal is wounded. - Politics...<eos> You hit him with your car.
Press?<eos> Great stones, they lay upon his chest until he pled aye or nay.<eos> They say he give them but two words.<eos> "More weight," he says and died.<eos> "More weight."<eos> Ah, crap.<eos> I forget the rest.<eos> Okay. That's a wrap, boys.<eos> I'm meeting with Bellingham tomorrow to get him to sign off on Portland.<eos> I thought you already had approval.
I'll just use my mom's emergency credit card until...<eos> Wait.<eos> Who is Mrs. Poluski?<eos> Mrs. Poluski, these are the other star competitors,<eos> Howie and Solomon.<eos> Guys, this is Mrs. Poluski.<eos> Poluski is name of Serbian rapist husband.<eos> I am Oksana.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Did you just pay her?

- Ghost!<eos> Well... we can't just go home now, can we?<eos> - Holy...<eos> - Ghost!<eos> - Holy...<eos> - Ghost!<eos> Come on.<eos> My parents are going to kill me if I'm not home in time.<eos> Chill out.<eos> It's happy hour, and you don't look happy.
Chill out.<eos> It's happy hour, and you don't look happy.<eos> Get your fakes out.<eos> My fake what?<eos> No.<eos> We have to go home now.<eos> Let's just vote on it.<eos> I love how hot I am in gay bars.<eos> Give him a second.<eos> - You going?
Any suggestions?<eos> They tell me not to write about the mayor, I don't.<eos> I don't write about you and Healy, either.<eos> I give in to everyone, and where does it get me?<eos> Who told you about me and Healy?<eos> I should still write an article on it.<eos> I might.<eos> It's news, real news.<eos> He shouldn't be allowed to teach at our school, and you...<eos> You don't know anything about what happened.
What?<eos> What was that all about?<eos> The bartender gave me a Molly, so I gave it to Solomon.<eos> What?<eos> He needs a little pick-me-up.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> I know.<eos> Didn't even get cast as Tituba.<eos> Healy says it was a race thing, which, in my opinion, is a totally amateur point of view, but...<eos> Baby girl, you're not even black.

Back it up.<eos> Historically, Tituba was South American Arawak, some shit like that, so...<eos> Hey, Howie.<eos> Settle this debate for us.<eos> You've read The Crucible, right?
I'm gonna go get the car.<eos> Ladies, man.<eos> Oh, it's so awesome.<eos> Guess what.<eos> I'm a lady's man.<eos> I try to get with girls, but it's like...<eos> - what's wrong with me?<eos> - Okay, okay, okay, just... Just calm down, buddy, okay?<eos> I'm not handsome.<eos> No. No, you're handsome. It's just... all of your shirts have alligators on 'em.

Okay, we would love three tickets.<eos> Wait.<eos> Where's Solomon?<eos> Is that him right...<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Solomon! Solomon!<eos> Solomon, what are you doing?<eos> - I hate my clothes.<eos> - Solomon!<eos> What the hell are you doing?

Solomon, just, just give me your hand, okay?<eos> - Stop it!<eos> Guys, come on.

Go right... right there.<eos> There you go.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> Why does my head feel so heavy?<eos> Can you feel my head, please?<eos> Feel it.<eos> Let me get you some water.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> Let me just...<eos> I can't believe you gave me drugs.
I just don't see why we need to rush there right now.<eos> They're gonna be home first thing in the morning.<eos> Okay, it's all right.<eos> I can go pick them up.<eos> I'll see if I can take off from work.<eos> I have to drive Diwata's car home anyway.<eos> I knew it.<eos> I warned you this would happen if we put him in a public school, didn't I?<eos> I'll see you in the morning.<eos> What you thinking about, Howie?

Next time, we'll compete together with our own material.<eos> We're weaker on our own, but together...<eos> I'm quitting, too.<eos> Guys, don't get a bad attitude because we lost once.<eos> Watch.<eos> Want some?<eos> Oh, no, not if there's alcohol in it.<eos> Well, it's not non-alcoholic wine, Diwata.<eos> I shouldn't then. I...<eos> Until I'm into a good BFA program, I need to protect my singing voice, you know?

And...<eos> I was just too scared to go in.<eos> 'Cause I'm not sure I'm...<eos> I did one of those, like, home tests, and it was, like, kind of a line, maybe not.<eos> I can't go to my family doctor, so I've gotta go back there to get official results.<eos> Do you have someone to go with you?<eos> Most of my friends are older, from theater camp, so...<eos> You know, as long as we figure out the time-difference issue, I think there's totally a way to integrate teenage Abraham Lincoln into The Crucible, my Mary Warren musical.<eos> I told you about it, right?<eos> So you have to tell me the story when you're sober.

Hello. I put the sign on the door.<eos> Mom.<eos> Don't say another word.<eos> You are on very thin ice.
You don't even have a faculty Advisor.<eos> I supervise team.<eos> Who the hell are... Who the hell is she?<eos> I work in cafeteria for seven years.<eos> Sir, we never intended...<eos> You all have parents on the school board. What is wrong with you?<eos> You're lucky that I don't suspend you all for fraudulently representing our school.<eos> You all have two weeks of detention, and no more clubs.<eos> What about the school newspaper?<eos> You're joking, right?
What about the school newspaper?<eos> You're joking, right?<eos> Journalism relies on morals, ethics, and honesty.<eos> There is no way that this school is gonna pay a dime towards these bills.<eos> I have some money saved up.<eos> Yeah, not enough to cover this.<eos> My mother's broke, Diwata.<eos> It's gonna take me all summer to even put a dent in this.<eos> If I was running things, we would have at least followed the rules.<eos> If you were running things, we never would have made it to Portland.

- What, too soon? - Yeah, too soon.<eos> Too soon.<eos> You know you're really lucky, right?<eos> I know.<eos> Especially since that guy, Mark... day after we did it, I... called just to say hey or whatever, and he was like,<eos> "I never would have slept with you if I wasn't so wasted," so...<eos> So you guys are... getting married?<eos> Yep. It's a spring wedding.<eos> I have a surprise for you.<eos> How did you get that?
I have a surprise for you.<eos> How did you get that?<eos> All the entries are archived at the library.<eos> Yep, he won second place.<eos> Prepare thyself.<eos> "Abraham was just 13 years old, but he already loved to read and learn.<eos> One day, he decided to journey into town to the library and see what adventures he could find.<eos> He read a book about the frontier, and he built a log cabin.<eos> He read a book about the law, and he became President."<eos> You didn't think I'd find out?

Press?<eos> Great stones, they lay upon his chest until he plead aye or nay.<eos> They say he give 'em but two words.<eos> "More weight," he says and died.<eos> More weight.<eos> Add another stone.<eos> Make him speak.<eos> More weight.<eos> Give us a name!<eos> Diwata, you want dinner?

Start there.<eos> I'm gonna be such a better parent than you guys, just FYI.<eos> Could you excuse us for a second?<eos> Diwata.<eos> What?<eos> Do you think my life is easy?<eos> That I enjoy eating at the restaurant where my daughter works?<eos> - Mom...<eos> - No, no, no, no, no.<eos> You're an adult.

How do you get people to listen to you?<eos> And now, I mean, they love you.<eos> Well, you know, getting people to listen to you is kind of the opposite of getting people to like you.<eos> You know, they tell me, "Stick to your two minutes."<eos> I remind them that I'm gonna speak until I'm done speaking.<eos> They can arrest me.<eos> I'm using their stage for my needs, not theirs, my terms.<eos> Life is a stage.<eos> Life is a stage.<eos> What are you doing here?

Sadly, I will not be participating in this year's show due to miscasting.<eos> As disturbing as this news has been to a lot of people in the community, I'm grateful it's led me to an amazing new group of people here at North Salem.<eos> I recently became part of the newly-formed Speech and Debate team, the first team in the school's history to almost make it to octo-finals at the highly prestigious Portland Invitational.<eos> And now, with my remaining two minutes, I'd like to show you our team's work to prove that the school should support, metaphorically and financially, our worthwhile endeavor.<eos> Arnie, lights.<eos> Where am I?<eos> I must have fallen through a wormhole and traveled back in time.<eos> But to when?<eos> And to where?<eos> ♪ Boy, what you doin'?

This is your guy.<eos> He'll tell you everything you need to know.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm Solomon.<eos> I used to work for the school paper.<eos> Rachel.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> So do you like working at the school paper?
At the beginning, it seemed like a better choice than yearbook...<eos> What?<eos> - What?<eos> - No, this has got to be a joke.<eos> What?<eos> - Anyway...<eos> - What?<eos> Accept it!<eos> No!<eos> You didn't realize he was into you?
Oh, my God.<eos> That is amazing.<eos> Have a point of view on my own school.<eos> I had to report on topics that were already decided on, and that's the opposite of reporting.<eos> But the newspaper, the arts, our clubs,<eos> Look. That's him. That's him.<eos> What's important to our lives.<eos> But all of these things, they were just a symptom of the larger problem.<eos> No one was listening to us.<eos> Well, Solomon, we're on air, and you're talking to five million people.

Previously on Teen Wolf...<eos> I'll never stop until we get everyone back.<eos> What if this was his room?<eos> What if this means we had a son?<eos> Mr. Douglas ate his pineal gland.<eos> What are you doing?
This is what the Ahnenerbe has been searching for.<eos> "Ghost Riders of the storm, "masters of infinite power."<eos> We are not chasing fairy tales, Hauptmann.<eos> The Occult is nothing to toy with.<eos> Neither are the riders of the storm.<eos> You have seen them?<eos> They are in the Ruhr Valley.<eos> My Kampfgruppe can secure the area tonight.<eos> An unstoppable army?<eos> Made up of the dead, you say?
An unstoppable army?<eos> Made up of the dead, you say?<eos> With power you have never seen.<eos> Tell me, how would you control this unstoppable army?<eos> How do you stop the unstoppable?<eos> How is your Kampfgruppe going to stop them?<eos> Tell us.

Malia, look around.<eos> We're the only ones left in Beacon Hills.<eos> If they take us, Lydia will be the only one left to haunt the place.<eos> That's why I'm the only person that's going in.<eos> Liam and Hayden will stay here with Mason.<eos> As long as somebody is left in Beacon Hills, the Wild Hunt can't move on.<eos> I like your plan, Scott.<eos> I really do, especially the part about turning Stiles.<eos> - But it can't work.<eos> - How do you know?

Scott, I admit that you have a flair for beating the odds.<eos> But, this?<eos> You don't walk away from.<eos> You run.<eos> His tracks outside lead north from here.<eos> Oh.<eos> This one's gone, too.<eos> Why take a Ghost Rider's pineal gland?<eos> So I could use this.<eos> What do you want?

It means he's not dead, Mason.<eos> And that there's still a chance.<eos> He only has pictures of us.<eos> There's, like, a hundred pictures here.<eos> And it's just us.<eos> Is that a little weird?<eos> No.<eos> It means he loves you.<eos> We need to get him back.<eos> When you were here before, how long until the Ghost Riders showed up?
What's a rift supposed to look like?<eos> If it's a tear in the fabric of our world.<eos> Theoretically it could look like anything from a microscopic black hole to a free-floating Einstein-Rosen bridge.<eos> I really hope it's not up there.<eos> Let's split up.<eos> Hey, look at this.<eos> The rift's not above us.<eos> It's below.<eos> So we should stay here.<eos> Is that what you're thinking?
It's got to be down here somewhere.<eos> Found it!<eos> It's remarkably similar.<eos> To what?<eos> To the Einstein-Rosen bridge.<eos> That's never going to happen.<eos> We're not making that deal.<eos> I hold all the cards.<eos> You're locked in a jail cell.<eos> You have no cards.
How do we know if we let you out, you won't run?<eos> 'Cause we're not letting him out.<eos> He's going to tell us from in here.<eos> I'm still going to need some incentive.<eos> He's a Lowenmensch.<eos> What the hell is a Lowenmensch?<eos> It's part-wolf, part-lion.<eos> He was a part of the Ahnenerbe,<eos> Himmler's personal project to use the Occult to win the war.<eos> Hauptmann, you should stay away.
Himmler's personal project to use the Occult to win the war.<eos> Hauptmann, you should stay away.<eos> All of us, we should stay away.<eos> You've seen them, Grenadier?<eos> They came by storm. They rode horses.<eos> They were unnatural.<eos> Over here!<eos> We are close.<eos> Spread out!<eos> You've done well, Grenadier Abel.
He could stop them.<eos> The Nazis lost the war.<eos> Why is he still obsessed?<eos> What does he want an army for?<eos> He doesn't want it for them.<eos> The Nazis were just a means to an end.<eos> He wants it for himself.<eos> His own personal, supernatural army.<eos> We need to warn Scott.<eos> You know what the best part about being a werewolf is?
Yeah, Liam, come on.<eos> We gotta hurry.<eos> We can still find him.<eos> No!<eos> Liam.<eos> Run!<eos> Liam.<eos> We have to get to Scott.<eos> Liam.<eos> You have to find Scott.
We can still find him.<eos> No!<eos> Liam.<eos> Run!<eos> Liam.<eos> We have to get to Scott.<eos> Liam.<eos> You have to find Scott.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> You have to.
No!<eos> Liam.<eos> Run!<eos> Liam.<eos> We have to get to Scott.<eos> Liam.<eos> You have to find Scott.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> You have to.<eos> You can save me on the other side.
I don't know how it happened, but it happened.<eos> Everything Lydia has been trying to tell us?<eos> It's all true.<eos> His bed, the clothes he never folds, his crime board.<eos> He's on the lacrosse team.<eos> I mean, he's terrible, but he's on the team.<eos> Claudia, we have a son.<eos> And we can find him and get him back.<eos> There's nothing here.<eos> You gotta come in the room, baby.

We always wanted to go to Big Sur.<eos> We did.<eos> I remember.<eos> No, baby.<eos> We didn't.<eos> I took this picture on your last good day.<eos> Stiles refused to leave your side.<eos> I was sick.<eos> But I started getting better.<eos> You were yourself all day.
The medication had started to work.<eos> Stiles couldn't stop talking about school, all the trouble he'd gotten into.<eos> He tried so hard to stay awake.<eos> When he finally fell asleep, it was in your arms.<eos> The doctors couldn't explain it.<eos> We started making plans, started dreaming again.<eos> We just sat together<eos> and watched each other.<eos> We didn't need to talk.<eos> But, when you finally closed your eyes,

And then the strangest thing happened.<eos> What?<eos> I thought I saw him.<eos> It's like something opened right there in the middle of the room.<eos> Just for a moment.<eos> And then it was gone.<eos> A rift.<eos> I thought there was only one rift.<eos> We saw it disappear.<eos> You remembered Stiles and then a new rift was created.
Yo!<eos> You need to get in here and pick out a wedding cake, or I'm gonna pick one out for you, and it'll be carrot. This is my fiancé, Christopher, the man who stole my heart...<eos> Christopher: You've reached Christopher Hall. Please leave a message.<eos> Alice: ...along with everything else.<eos> I gave him my entire life savings.<eos> What is wrong with me?<eos> He did leave one thing behind.<eos> He joked about getting it for me as a wedding gift.<eos> And then when I got home last night, it was here.<eos> You want to play?
His real name is Benjamin Jones.<eos> I was going to tell you everything.<eos> What we had was real, and I love you.<eos> Jules: All agents, move in.<eos> And he's part of something bigger.<eos> They're called the Kensington Firm.<eos> A British crime family.<eos> Alice: This is Sybil Griffiths, the mother of Rhys and Margot.<eos> They're pulling a job tonight.<eos> We'll catch them in the act, put them away, and you will be free.

So, welcome to Los Angeles.<eos> I am aware that changes in leadership can be unsettling.<eos> I assure you your loyalty will be rewarded.<eos> Felix, Alfie.<eos> Something you want to say?<eos> Actually, there is.<eos> [Cellphone rings]<eos> Hello?<eos> [Gunshot]<eos> Felix, you were saying.
I'll bet you he's exactly like that.<eos> Look at him leaning back in his chair.<eos> He can't get far enough away from us.<eos> That's how fired we are.<eos> No, he's just that comfortable here.<eos> Except now he's out of the chair.<eos> But smiling and shaking hand...<eos> Ooh, shaking with both hands.<eos> - He's overcompensating.<eos> - So are you right now.

I swear. I got plenty of money.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> Valerie: $3 million?<eos> The IRS says that it is in a bank account somewhere, in my name, and that I have to pay taxes on it, but I don't have that kind of money.<eos> Or do I?<eos> 'Cause it is in my name, and that's my Social Security number.<eos> It could be an accounting error.<eos> Or identity theft, although they usually take money.<eos> They don't give it.<eos> Whoever parked this money in your name knew you well enough to think you'd never find it.

Meeting went well, I thought.<eos> Were we at the same meeting?<eos> Ivor shouldn't have been on his phone.<eos> I'm not talking about Ivor.<eos> I'm talking about the three leftenants who didn't show up.<eos> All three missed payments this month, too.<eos> Look, here's one of our opium freighters.<eos> Apparently just vanished in the South Pacific.<eos> And a gold transport that was seized by the Swiss authorities.<eos> These things do happen, you know.
Oh, do you mean like the one that destroyed our five-star hotel in Bilbao?<eos> When did that happen?<eos> Today.<eos> It's blatant disrespect.<eos> I need to find these turncoats.<eos> Well, I can't tell you where to find them, but I can tell you what they all have in common.<eos> They were all me.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> All three started off as your mother's right hand before being promoted.<eos> What are you going to do?

Which is why you can't go anywhere near it.<eos> But why?<eos> Uh, because it's in my name.<eos> So it's mine now, legally.<eos> Free and clear.<eos> Okay, it's not about the money anymore.<eos> It's about your life.<eos> Whoever killed the Kincaids, the minute they find out the money's in your name, they're gonna come after you.<eos> But this money could change everything for me.<eos> I-I mean, I could go somewhere, disappear, and... and you wouldn't have to worry about me ever again.
But this money could change everything for me.<eos> I-I mean, I could go somewhere, disappear, and... and you wouldn't have to worry about me ever again.<eos> I would be worried about you every minute for the rest of my life.<eos> These people, whoever they are, they're killers.<eos> So, if they find you...<eos> Yeah, but they won't.<eos> They won't, okay? I promise.<eos> Tommy, stop!<eos> Listen to me!<eos> If you touch that money, I cannot help you.
Listen to me!<eos> If you touch that money, I cannot help you.<eos> But if I take that money, I won't need your help.<eos> But thank you. Oh.<eos> Oh! I love you.<eos> And, uh, Allie, I'm gonna be fine.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'll call the FBI.<eos> I'll have them freeze the money.<eos> Why would you do that?
But thank you. Oh.<eos> Oh! I love you.<eos> And, uh, Allie, I'm gonna be fine.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'll call the FBI.<eos> I'll have them freeze the money.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Because I'm trying to keep you alive.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> You're trying to keep me exactly where I am so that you can go on and keep being the successful one.

You are just like me.<eos> And maybe worse... [Elevator bell dings] ...'cause at least I'm not pretending to be something that I'm not.<eos> Is now a bad time?<eos> Oh, dear. Has it come to this?<eos> What on earth are you doing?<eos> I'm trying to make a living now that my sister has stolen the family business out from under me.<eos> Well, you'll be glad to hear someone's trying to steal it from under me.<eos> [Chuckles] Wow, that didn't take long.<eos> Who is it?<eos> I was hoping you could tell me.
Does it look like I am masterminding the takedown of the Kensington Firm?<eos> Or perhaps if someone would stop standing there like a bloody waxwork.<eos> He really is magnificent, isn't he?<eos> Oh, you have no idea.<eos> No, I do.<eos> [Trunk closes] Anyway, the Firm belongs to you now.<eos> Nothing to do with me.<eos> It's not just the Firm.<eos> Whoever it is is after us... You, me, and Mum.<eos> Oh. Concerned about Mum now, are you?

Concerned about Mum now, are you?<eos> As a matter of fact, I just visited her in prison.<eos> I'm sorry, but you don't get points for that if you're the one that put her in there in the first place.
She wasn't angry with me.<eos> Mum was frightened.<eos> She was having you on.<eos> Someone is targeting us.<eos> Our assets are under attack.<eos> Our people are disappearing.<eos> I need your help.<eos> You got rid of me.<eos> You got rid of Ben.<eos> You even put your own mother in jail just to get what you wanted.

I can't trace it.<eos> Maybe the Bureau can.<eos> And in the meantime, Jason Kooley...<eos> The man who stabbed Ben in the shower...<eos> I'd like to speak with him, please.<eos> ♪ ♪ You all right?<eos> You seem tense.

You said I'd have to watch the trunk only till the first show.

You know it'll be safest with Julia.

Not there.<eos> Oh no, they'll commit 'harakiri'.<eos> No!<eos> Never!<eos> OK, close your eyes.<eos> Two steps forward.<eos> And then a left!<eos> OK, release.<eos> - Release!<eos> Julie, what are you doing?

I understand"<eos> - No, you do not understand!<eos> I can have you arrested for this.<eos> C'mon, David please"<eos> Excuse me, that's Major General Harding to you.<eos> And what are you smiling at, you moron?<eos> If you had any sense, you wouldn't have shot him and we could've caught the mole.<eos> 11 pm tomorrow, at Singhat.<eos> He faithfully worked for you for 15 years.<eos> You denied him his last rites.

At least I'm not heartless.<eos> Hey Kiddo... Come here.<eos> Come" come"<eos> Your tongue has become as sharp as your knives.<eos> Nothing of mine is mine, Rusi.<eos> Neither my tongue. Nor my heart.<eos> Not even my mind.<eos> You set me free and I fly.<eos> You call me and I'm back in your lap.<eos> When you want I'm Julia, when you wish, Mrs. Billimoria.
You set me free and I fly.<eos> You call me and I'm back in your lap.<eos> When you want I'm Julia, when you wish, Mrs. Billimoria.<eos> Such big words from my little Julia.<eos> Who's been teaching you all this?<eos> Remember". .<eos> It's a Rusi Billimoria creation.<eos> He was my shadow.<eos> Yet I was unaware that he was working for the INA.<eos> What would you have done if he'd told you?
The flame from the Sufis lamp<eos> The embers keep burning even when doused<eos> This is love, this is love" This is love, this is love"<eos> The river sleeps, resting its head on the banks<eos> Has been flowing for ages, rising from the eyes<eos> This is love, this is love"<eos> Seeking solitude, weaving shadows<eos> Keeping its ears open for the silk of the eyes<eos> This is love, this is love"<eos> You'll get me killed.
Sometimes the wound is in one place, the pain in another.<eos> Ms. Haseena...?<eos> Mr. Billimoria, we're still searching for Sergeant Malik.<eos> He will be here any moment.<eos> Thank you, Major.<eos> Only one of us can live..<eos> Me"<eos> or him.<eos> Nawab!<eos> Nawab, you need to get out of here right now.

Indian National Army.<eos> We have a visitor, Major General.<eos> At this hour?<eos> Who?<eos> A very special guest.<eos> I think you'd want to meet them.<eos> Good.<eos> Excuse me, gentlemen.<eos> Come with me.<eos> You're a traitor.
You're a traitor.<eos> Not just for me, but for your army too.<eos> For your entire community!<eos> I was a traitor when I was a British soldier.<eos> I realised that I've been a slave for generations.<eos> We need freedom from these monsters.<eos> Whether we die for it or kill for it.<eos> My life's for the taking.<eos> Take it.<eos> Nawab, you're making a mistake.

They should've been here before us.<eos> Shit!<eos> I'm out Sir!<eos> They're running out of ammunition.<eos> Take the sword and cross the bridge.<eos> And you?<eos> I'll hold them off, leave now.<eos> Not without you.<eos> Son of a gun!<eos> Once you cross over, the INA post is about 2 miles away.
- Hold back.<eos> We need that sword.<eos> They won't spare my life.<eos> Trying to save me is pointless.<eos> Miss Julia.<eos> I promise a fair trial for Sergeant Malik and no case for you.<eos> My word before my life.<eos> If not by bullets, then on the gallows.<eos> My death is certain tomorrow.<eos> But you're alive today.
What the hell is he trying to do, sir?<eos> The rascal wants to get himself killed.<eos> Sergeant Malik, one more step and you're dead.<eos> Go Julia!<eos> Farewell it is, surely not goodbye<eos> The body is surely not bereft of the sou!<eos> Blow the bridge!<eos> - No!<eos> Kiddo, come back.<eos> What do you want?

All right, gentlemen...<eos> Right here is Black Rock Mountain, men.<eos> Fifteen to twenty minutes ago,<eos> Alpha Coy, became engaged by 5O to 100 fighters, up, around, and on the vicinity of Black Rock mountain.<eos> They're also taking some indirect fires from this location.<eos> They hope to have them, uh, backstopped by Bravo Coy and compress the enemy between the two of 'em, setting the conditions for us to come in and do our air assault.<eos> What's our plan for this evening?<eos> Basically, we're rolling in with the attack of the Command Element in order to secure a, uh, high-traffic region for the, uh... the Taliban.<eos> So you'll be with Command Element in a Black Hawk and I'll be up with the Joe's in a Chinook, yeah?

- Let's go, let's go, let's go.<eos> Watch your six.<eos> - Hey, that's it!<eos> - Sir, we got two.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> It's more like the one guy we wanted too.<eos> There were insurgents that had squirted out from some of these targets and they were hunkering in a palm grove.<eos> The aircraft overhead thought that they were digging up weapons caches and things like that.<eos> The next morning, the Green Beret's called in and used air strikes.<eos> Is that cache right around the area where they were low-calling and shit too, you think?

I took a breath and said, Okay, Chad, you know, throw me your knife.<eos> I'll open the strap on the ammo can.<eos> I'll put the camera down because there was nobody else.<eos> I don't think in that moment it made me a combatant. I don't think I necessarily crossed the line Journalistically.<eos> Had you thought through that moment before?<eos> Or was it one of those things that you just said, if it comes, it comes and I'll...<eos> There becomes a moment when you might have to check your moral compass and your gut, and figure out what's the right thing to do.<eos> And in my career, there's been moments where... is it the reporter thing or is it the human thing?<eos> And I think in times like that, the human thing needs to win out.<eos> How old are you?
Can you tell by the cups and all that he loved the Avalanches?<eos> And these are some of the players that he liked.<eos> We buried him with his hockey stick and we buried him with his number 18, his Hockey shirt from Franklin.<eos> And that went with him.<eos> My dad always said, to really get to know Rob you needed to go to the places he went, experience what he loved and see the things he built.<eos> .HeY, buddy, good to see you,<eos> - You too, Shawn.<eos> - How's everything?<eos> - Uh, it's going, it's going.<eos> - Good, good. How you doing?
And it was that moment that I was able to prove to myself that I was back from the injury and that it was time to get back to Iraq.<eos> Neither one of you have ever heard this story.<eos> I'm sure we haven't.<eos> The last Christmas that Rob was here, which was, um, 2006, we went up to Uncle Ralph's as we always do.<eos> We go up to Uncle Ralph's for Christmas Eve...<eos> - Christmas Eve.<eos> And opened all the presents.<eos> We do what we always do.<eos> You and dad left early, and Rob and I stayed.<eos> - Tara, what are you looking at?
- Cosette?<eos> - Robbie.<eos> - Robbie?<eos> When Rob decided he wanted to leave, we got in the car and left Uncle Ralph's.<eos> We were driving home and it was the moments that Rob confided in me for the first time.<eos> It was one of those times where he just let it all out.<eos> And he told me that he wasn't necessarily planning on coming home.<eos> Oh, from Iraq, okay.<eos> So he had an idea in 2006 that he wouldn't be home.<eos> You know Rob.
Oh, from Iraq, okay.<eos> So he had an idea in 2006 that he wouldn't be home.<eos> You know Rob.<eos> It doesn't surprise me, but I didn't...<eos> As a mother, he ain't gonna confide in me all that stuff anyways, but I did not know that.<eos> I can remember the last time... I dropped at the airport.<eos> I saw him that Christmas.<eos> And he says, "You don't have to hug me."<eos> Until this day, I wish I did.<eos> Well, you don't know.
But the other one might be old enough to be him.<eos> Do you have a first name, Hussein?<eos> Robert.<eos> Pull those detainees and go down out of the element.<eos> Have the source take a look at both those jack-asses.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Hey, Bob!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm gonna need you and Ranger in about 3 minutes.<eos> - Ali Abu... - Bob, you move with...
He is 360 meters, and he's hunkered down.<eos> I follow.<eos> Go, go.<eos> Okay, well, one, two, three, four.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So far, it looks like he's hunkered down.<eos> - I'm checking for movement. - C0py.<eos> If we get a good shot here, let's stop and look.<eos> Sir, fire some flares.<eos> See if you can stir him up.
See the major over there? - He's running the show.<eos> We're just his little followers right now, putting the Iraqi army first.<eos> Most of these guys... The soldiers... Personally know the farmers in here.<eos> So even to come in here and clear palm groves it's a social call.<eos> You know, they come in here and talk to their friends. We try to enforce, you know, the fact that they need to clear this, but they're like, "Oh, no, it's my brother, it's my friend."<eos> He's good."<eos> - He might be good, but...<eos> - It's a happy morning gathering.<eos> That's all it... It's a social call.<eos> Get a few mandarins while you're at it.
- You did.<eos> - It was right there.<eos> - They were growing on trees.<eos> You pretty much cut 'em out at the root.<eos> A terrorist...<eos> Has anybody found anything yet?<eos> Any caches?<eos> Any signs of...<eos> - Okay. - Just let me check.<eos> - You're gonna go see it in the future?
So we're moving back to the vehicles!<eos> - We're moving back to the vehicles now.<eos> We have... Hey, we up, Mo.<eos> Hey, Gunners be advised, we're moving out of the palm grove.<eos> Hey, spread out, you guys.<eos> Keep eyes for fucking trip wires.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Hey, keep eyes to the north also!<eos> Holy fuck.<eos> - Right there, you see the smoke?
Ah, fuck! Fuck.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Ah, fuck, mmm, yoga pants.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Chacho, let's go! Let's go!<eos> Suspect's in black Chevy.<eos> We got him.<eos> - Holy shit!<eos> What the fuck was that?<eos> - What are you stopping for?
Let's go!<eos> Chacho, let's go! Let's go!<eos> Suspect's in black Chevy.<eos> We got him.<eos> - Holy shit!<eos> What the fuck was that?<eos> - What are you stopping for?<eos> Put your gun on the fucking floor.<eos> It's not my fault.<eos> You're the one driving like a fucking dick.
