It's just like a fingerprint.<eos> No two are alike.<eos> We'll find him.<eos> We'll find him.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I got to get that doll back, Al.<eos> I'm going to call the guy we sold it to.<eos> Remember, Kel-- "Quoth the raven...<eos> You rang?"<eos> Dad, you know, I haven't given this baseball card thing a fair chance, so I'll have my friend Teddy come over and check it out.
Somebody said to me, "Well what does it mean?"<eos> I said, " It means I killed a man in prison for asking fucking questions."<eos> And that seemed to satisfy his curiosity.<eos> Another guy says to me, "Are you gay?"<eos> I say, "Well bend over and let's find out."<eos> You know, I mean it's the same thing if a man carries a little bag, a little purse in his hand you know?<eos> That's all it is, it's a little purse.<eos> It's a purse that's all.<eos> Some guys can't handle that word.<eos> Some guys who carry them can't even call it that.
Oh, you mean Coach?<eos> She's right over there.<eos> What's your name and favorite sexual position, sweet thing? Frank?<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Don't be grabbing the coach like that!<eos> It's a victory party, Frank.<eos> We won against Dearborn.<eos> Great! Is this how you celebrate... drinking beer with your players?<eos> I wasn't drinking the beer. They were.<eos> I mean, I was taking it away from them.
I've been waiting months for supplies.<eos> Thank you, MacGyver, but I'm afraid your efforts were useless.<eos> You know, you sure don't strike me as the type of fellow who'd give up so easy.<eos> I don't waste time on the impossible.<eos> Well, maybe we can whip up something out of what you got around here.<eos> Electric arc welding.<eos> I could use a man of your talents around here, MacGyver.<eos> Well, the way I see things, Mr. Trumbo, you don't need anybody.<eos> Maybe a little cheap labor and a few good machines.<eos> Hey, mister, I've fought this jungle back, cut it down, created my boundaries, my world.
OK. Listen. Everybody knows Victor Maitland is a hotshot art dealer.<eos> But I poked around.<eos> Art's not the only thing he deals.<eos> I saw some guys in his warehouse unloading a crate of German bearer bonds.<eos> Michael Tandino had bonds like this on him, coincidentally, when he was killed.<eos> Just because Maitland invests in the same bonds doesn't mean he's a killer.<eos> The man's not an investor, he's a smuggler, be it bonds, drugs or whatever.<eos> The crate I saw didn't even pass through customs.<eos> Maitland is paying to get his shipments out before they're inspected.<eos> When his guys get it, they take the drugs or bonds out of the crates and they send it back before customs even knows what's going on.
You try anything and I'll kill ya.<eos> Straight ahead.<eos> Lay the money down on the table.<eos> We can have a count.<eos> - Okay, my man.<eos> Let me check out the stuff first.<eos> - Right over this way.<eos> Straight ahead.<eos> You've got four boxes... 12 bottles to the box-yours. [Grunts]<eos> - [Groans] - [Glass Shatters] Or maybe I'll just keep it, smart stuff, and the money too.
"that has a brand-new '79 van.<eos> "It's been on his lot for eight months...<eos> "and he's priced it down to $5,000 where it can be bought. "<eos> He said, "I know it can be bought for $5,000."<eos> That's kind of the range I was looking for.<eos> And sure enough, I called the man.<eos> He brought it to me... and in the process of three hours, I owned the van.<eos> God made all things... that was made.<eos> All things that was made.<eos> And he looked on it, and pronounced it... good and very good!
Also...<eos> No treasures and got all beaten up.<eos> And the people trying to hunt us down too.<eos> Couldn't imagine that guy to be so skilled!<eos> That asshole, he's skilled and has a good reputation, no one would believe us.<eos> Then what should we do?<eos> How would I know?<eos> Zhang Baozai's treasures and Fahua Temple, what's the link between them?<eos> I wouldn't be asking you if I knew.<eos> We haven't read the letter yet, why don't you study it?
- Hello, girl.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Okay. Come in. We're round the back.<eos> - Watch your foot, son.<eos> - Praying for rain, eh?<eos> - Hello, Bod.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - What a crazy garden, Max.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I had a bad case of weeds, so I sprayed it all with poison.
is this how priests are treated in Chendo?<eos> To be taken by force, like thieves?<eos> Like- - Like innocent deer snatched from freedom and shackled?<eos> Before I am finished, you both will thank me.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Two unknown priests. No different from thousands of your brothers.<eos> In a few days, you will be famous.<eos> One does not become a priest to seek fame.<eos> You are not seeking it.<eos> I am thrusting it upon you.
'I crawled along the floor, thinking:<eos> "'How the hell can I get under that door?"<eos> 'I sensed somebody else in the room.<eos> 'I wished it was part of my nightmare, but it wasn't.<eos> 'It was Tommy Ray.<eos> He'd never blow another horn.<eos> 'I was torn between making myself walk 'and wanting to lie down on the bed.<eos> 'It was a lovely bed. It was made of rose leaves.<eos> 'It was the most beautiful bed in the world.<eos> 'They'd got it from Carole Lombard.
You don't know.<eos> No one knows.<eos> If they thought you knew, you would never be allowed out of the country.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> No questions asked or answered.<eos> You have made a great sacrifice for the Fatherland.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> Good.<eos> Why anyone would want that wretched island I'll never know.<eos> Did I tell you, Franz, I managed to get rid of it?
Hey, it's time for a halt, isn't it?<eos> You said it.<eos> Since morning we've marched 25 miles at least.<eos> I'd love a drink of cold spring water.<eos> Half a bucketful for every man here.<eos> Regiment!<eos> Forward march!<eos> The war had reached even this remote farm lost in the vast steppes near the river Don.<eos> You drink that water like you read your son's letters.<eos> You read a little bit, then you put it away to read more later.
Yeah, so what if I am?<eos> So you need dock insurance.<eos> "Dock insurance"? I don't need any insurance.<eos> That's what you think?<eos> Uh, hey! Get over here. I need a little help.<eos> We can't pay our insurance this week.<eos> Can we pay it next week?<eos> You're supposed to pay it every week.<eos> What you need is a little lesson. Take him.<eos> Hold it. Now, you listen. If you don't clear out of here, you won't know what hit you.
- I thought you'd be on your way home by now.<eos> - Right. But I sort of missed the plane.<eos> Anyway, it suddenly struck me... an umbrella.<eos> Mr. Jones, did someone ask you to invite us here?<eos> What are those curtains doing there?<eos> I thought we were going to get to see an exhibit. Jones.<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm dying to see it.<eos> After all that silly business we had modeling for it.
Oh, am I glad you're not hurt.<eos> Those canoes aren't very stable.<eos> It was just one of those things!<eos> Just one of those things, Mac.<eos> I admit it, it was stupid.<eos> We were out testing this baby, and I thought we'd sneak up on you and make a few waves.<eos> - I guess I blew it, huh?<eos> - The sound you hear... is the wind rushing through my brother's head.<eos> Look, all I can say is I'm sorry.<eos> Just let me have a list of all your stuff, and I'll replace it.
I don't want sandwiches.<eos> make malai-Kofta<eos> what's this?<eos> - Call it anything you wish we call it mutton cutlet.<eos> For whom?<eos> Mac only eats what I eat.<eos> - ask him<eos> Yes, honey?<eos> - Whom is the mutton cutlet for?<eos> Mutton cutlet - why did he make it?
- ask him<eos> Yes, honey?<eos> - Whom is the mutton cutlet for?<eos> Mutton cutlet - why did he make it?<eos> I thinK he has his way around here<eos> How can you stand it?<eos> - You are right<eos> why did you make the mutton cutlet?<eos> Who did you ask before making it?<eos> You don't Know who ate it?
I thinK he has his way around here<eos> How can you stand it?<eos> - You are right<eos> why did you make the mutton cutlet?<eos> Who did you ask before making it?<eos> You don't Know who ate it?<eos> - Do you eat mutton, Mac?<eos> When did I eat mutton?<eos> - Did I say you ate?<eos> Then who ate it?
I hear my ring-a-ling.<eos> Let's see what's happening.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hello. Good evening, chicaboo. How are you?<eos> You wanna hear that song again?<eos> You know something?<eos> All the other jocks been gettin' this call all day... for this big bad song about the runaway guy.<eos> I wonder what he's doing now.<eos> I think he's gettin' his thing together too.<eos> We'll play it for you.
What's that?<eos> - What? - That.<eos> Who'll sing my song<eos> I, said the dove<eos> As she sat on a bush<eos> I'll sing your song<eos> You said you were too tired to walk.<eos> It tastes lovely.<eos> It's all right.<eos> The birds are eating it.
We'd be grateful if you'd keep it as simple as possible.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> The information is inserted here...<eos> I see. In what form is this information?<eos> Handwritten, on a standard input docket.<eos> - Like this?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But you say the message or whatever is handwritten, it seems an antiquated method in this electronic age.<eos> It's one of the best security checks we have.<eos> This device scans the card and compares it with standard samples.
Right, sir.<eos> All right, men, I'm in charge of this detail.<eos> Ensign Maxwell Smart, United States Naval Reserve.<eos> Now you men probably think that just because we're not going to sea and because I'm on temporary duty here that this is going to be a soft touch.<eos> Well, you're wrong!<eos> Now hear this:<eos> I intend to run a taut ship, because a taut ship is a happy ship, whereas a loose ship, uh... leaks a lot.<eos> Now this is what will be known as a PD detail.<eos> Now for those of you who are summertime sailors, you are probably not familiar with that expression.<eos> Well, I'll explain it to you.
Nemecsek...<eos> Yes, it's me.<eos> One of those cowards from the Paul Street.<eos> I've got those small feet, even smaller than those of Wendauer.<eos> I took our flag back.<eos> Here it is.<eos> So, go ahead!<eos> Do anything to me that you want!<eos> Beat me to death or wrest it from my hands!<eos> Since I'm certainly not going to hand it over by myself!
When I got there it was a practical joke.<eos> Final insult, I missed the last train and had to take a bus.<eos> A bus!<eos> I found these in the ... in the ladies' waiting room.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes. - I suppose it was the practical joker.<eos> - Yes, I suppose it was.<eos> Is this station identical to Norborough?<eos> Yes, almost every detail.<eos> Sir Scott Simon designed it.
You're the one who's made the mistake, Hurrah.<eos> Yes, I let others try to kill you.<eos> I almost deprived myself of this measureless pleasure.<eos> Any last words, Mr. Smart? Yes.<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> Your last chance, Mr. Smart.<eos> Make a phone call and guarantee the money, and I'll let you live.<eos> You're bluffing, Hurrah.<eos> You've used up most of the formula in demonstrations already.<eos> Our chemists in Europe will duplicate the formula as soon as I deliver it there.
I don't know.<eos> At least he's still spared the anguish of the truth.<eos> He knows.<eos> - I'm certain.<eos> - He couldn't.<eos> Arthur would never banish the knights so unjustly.<eos> It's your conscience talking. It's impatient for you to be punished.<eos> He knows!<eos> Well, why would he change the law?<eos> Rule out the use of swords to settle disputes... and replace it with a court and judge?
Evans?<eos> - Farber, Farreli, Ferone...<eos> - Present.<eos> Joseph Ferone. Do they call you Joe?<eos> I see you're to be in my English class as well.<eos> Tell me, do you like English?<eos> Well.<eos> I think there's time for you to fill out a Delaney card now.<eos> If you will just fill in the blanks, please.<eos> I don't know why they call it a Delaney card.
- No, no, no, Petyov.<eos> They can take him to NVD themselves.<eos> I am taking no chances.<eos> I am putting this film in my pocket, and you and I are personally going to escort it to the Swiss legation.<eos> - But I think I should...<eos> - No, Captain.<eos> I must absolutely insist.<eos> You two, take him out.<eos> You other two, come with us.<eos> Because not only do I want to see these films safely in the legation, I am personally going to hand it to the projectionist, and you and I are going to watch it being threaded into the machine.
It was ancient history, just after the atomic age.<eos> Used for radiation sickness.<eos> Adrenaline!<eos> Doctor, hyronalin is the specific accepted for all radiation sickness.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, now.<eos> But before, adrenaline.<eos> Highly promising.<eos> Early research.<eos> But they abandoned it when hyronalin was discovered.
Right lets have it.<eos> What's happening? Everything's gone fine so far.<eos> Speak up, we can't hear you very well.<eos> Oh, it's these spots.<eos> Oh, she's having spot trouble.<eos> Oh yes. Right, how is the plan working so far?<eos> It's gone fine.<eos> And the rocket arrived right on time in Hungary.<eos> And Jamie's got his entrance pass and has started phase one.<eos> Do you think the boy can handle it?
We are protected here.<eos> Now, nobody comes here. They used to come at first, on foot and on horseback;<eos> the trip lasted months... years even. Searching...<eos> Searching for gold and emeralds.<eos> They paid no attention to the diamonds. They didn't know its value.<eos> In those days, all this land was bare.<eos> Nobody lived here. No one had ever been here.<eos> The diamonds detached themselves and rolled into the river.<eos> During the floods, the river would carry them farther away.<eos> The stone is heavy... but the river carried it all, leaving it on the banks when it dried up.
-Now, it's up to Steven and the others.<eos> -Quite so, my dear. Quite so.<eos> The Monoids are up to something.<eos> They're rushing about all over the place.<eos> Do you think they're preparing to leave the Ark?<eos> Probably.<eos> Look, isn't there a way to get out of this kitchen?<eos> None.<eos> The walls are thick and the doors only open from the outside.<eos> -Well, who opens it?
Why?<eos> What's so special about the Doctor?<eos> He doesn't wear some sort of invisible shield, does he?<eos> Jenny, go outside and keep watch.<eos> She's not callous really.<eos> When people fight, they have to fight the Daleks in their own way.<eos> Barbara, I should like you to find your friend, the Doctor, and give him my notes.<eos> - You said you'd finished the bomb.<eos> - I have.<eos> Why can't you give it to him yourself?
- What for?<eos> 'What for'?<eos> To hear you talking like this.<eos> I wanted to have fun.<eos> Mr. Cesare.<eos> Do you think I didn't look for other jobs?<eos> I had even found one.<eos> But it was a cashier's job.<eos> They asked for a deposit. 50,000 lire.<eos> Who was going to give it to me?
Do it again. Yes, my lord.<eos> Have it ready by this evening.<eos> Lord Ambrose. Please excuse this intrusion, but I must see you.<eos> They said I should find you here.<eos> My music...<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Tomorrow may be too late.<eos> They're printing my music with... I think you mean my music, don't you?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I bought it from you, remember?
Oh, that's not entirely true.<eos> I'm very fond of you.<eos> Did you buy me that Brancusi?<eos> Nobody ever heard of him.<eos> I asked the whole city hall.<eos> He's a sculptor, darling.<eos> Like Michelangelo, Maillol, Rodin and me.<eos> Last time you told me you wrote poetry.<eos> No.<eos> I just echo it.
We'd never desert you.<eos> Never.<eos> My last wish is that you love one another as I have loved you.<eos> The greatest gift a man can give is to lay down his life for his friends.<eos> And when I am gone, you will be grieved.<eos> But your grief will turn into joy.<eos> A woman in childbirth feels pain.<eos> But when her child is born, she does not remember the pain.<eos> For a child has been born into the world.<eos> And one day I will see you again, and when I do your joy will be such that no one can take it from you.
Thank you.<eos> Don't get cheated like Signora Coogan when she took Paolo to Capri last summer.<eos> Contessa.<eos> They say she was the only one in the party Paolo didn't make love to.<eos> That poor thing, she broke out with such a horrible nervous eczema flew straight to Africa and hid herself in the jungles.<eos> - Little ham?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> However, there's one nice thing about Paolo.<eos> Signora Coogan had a great deal of very important jewelry and she used to have it in her bathroom all night in a soap dish without even locking the door.<eos> Paolo never touched it.
I'll be five minutes.<eos> Where did I put it?<eos> A green calling card.<eos> Did you watch TV today? Not at all.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Her number at home and at work.<eos> Why do you want it?<eos> Today, on TV, she showed the scores...<eos> After the accident... when nothing was sure, I made a copy.<eos> When you picked it up, I knew you'd destroy it. I kept the copy.
But there's no fireplace!<eos> Oh, you also like fireplaces?<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> - They provide intimacy, warmth, true?<eos> - Of course!<eos> - Come in.<eos> I had a house with a fireplace, but this is not mine.<eos> Mine are the prints, the books, the disks.<eos> I rent a house for three, four months, then I leave it.<eos> I try not to begin to like it, in fact I chose it ugly on purpose!
- l'll wait here!<eos> - But I'm busy! - Go ahead!<eos> - Say...<eos> What were you saying? - Me?<eos> Nothing.<eos> But weren't we talking when the gentleman...?<eos> - Ah, I was talking about my wife!<eos> - Go on, go on!<eos> - Eh!<eos> Dear Monsignore, you won't believe it, but the 7 0-80,000 lire... .. I need to get a house, I don't have it!
Something to do with keys.<eos> As building owner, you have the keys to the building?<eos> Naturally.<eos> - Here they are.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I also have the keys to the cellar and to the guardhouse.<eos> What about the small door?<eos> Er, behind the trash bin downstairs.<eos> Ah, no.<eos> I suppose the concierge must have it.
- Where are you? I can't see you.<eos> Here, in the laundry basket, where you said we should be.<eos> Well?<eos> - It would be simple to seduce you.<eos> - Do you think so?<eos> Certainly. But one gets older and more considerate, you understand.<eos> - If I really try, I'll understand.<eos> - You learn not to be indiscriminate.<eos> - Not to pluck every flower you see.<eos> - But you can smell it, anyhow.
Yeah.<eos> Here's your hat.<eos> You're looking for me, Benson?<eos> You were the last one to look at the slides yesterday?<eos> Yeah, and they were the greatest...<eos> Look, don't try to worm out of it.<eos> You know what you did?<eos> You touched it.<eos> Touched it?<eos> And smudged it!
I know it's no good.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> You don't mind, do you?<eos> Come on.<eos> Jake? Jake!<eos> You're not going, are you?<eos> - I'd like to get some air.<eos> - At least let me buy you a drink.<eos> - No, the bar's too crowded.<eos> - I'll get it. What are you having? - Pernod.
I'm a prisoner.<eos> I was arrested this here very afternoon, I was, for debt.<eos> Arrested for debt?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And the man that's put me in here said that you'll get out before I do.<eos> So I better be off to finding me self a bed somewhere before I do anything else.<eos> Bless my heart and soul.<eos> How much was the sum?<eos> 25 pound.<eos> I'LL pay it.
Another blue one.<eos> "The spring song mattress company".<eos> No.<eos> Uh, as I told you...<eos> A green van.<eos> "Gewgaws, limited".<eos> Does that ring a bell?<eos> No.<eos> It was definitely none of them.<eos> You can't say that for certain if you didn't see it, can you?
What did you say?<eos> What could I say?<eos> If we were convinced of that, we'd do all we could to oppose that evil.<eos> We'd have to be very sure, if we were in Willingdon's position.<eos> I told him that.<eos> But every man has to act according to his own conscience.<eos> Did it occur to you that his mind might be unbalanced?<eos> No, I wouldn't venture an opinion.<eos> If it was, perhaps we're to blame.<eos> We've placed on his shoulders this burden and left him to deal with it.
"If it's near a train station, he will buy it."<eos> "Certainly."<eos> "Hiroko, Hiroko!"<eos> Sorry for bothering you.<eos> No, it's all right.<eos> As I came to Ginza for shopping, I wanted to say hello to you.<eos> Tokyo is really big.<eos> As I stay home every day, I really feel good here.<eos> How's your conjugal life?<eos> I manage it anyhow.
Why do you keep going on about such a trivial thing?<eos> Ah, Kitamura.<eos> - Is that you, Kaneko?<eos> - What's the trouble?<eos> The trouble is this little upstart!<eos> He doesn't realise the value of the thing he's taken.<eos> This knife was a gift to me from my lord.<eos> Even so, it's possible he may ask for it back.<eos> Yes, I suppose every lord is like a child.<eos> When he's in a good mood, he gives, and in a foul mood, he demands it back.
It's conceivable that because of the year that you've had...<eos> The deaths, going to Hell, Kenzi leaving.<eos> It could be psychological.<eos> Maybe it's a good thing.<eos> No power, no responsibility, no being "The One."<eos> I can be free...<eos> Bo.<eos> It's one of the brothers.<eos> The picture we found on Big Tak'o?<eos> Musashi says Craig took it during a secret party trip in Osaka.
Try again.<eos> Alright ladies, phones are closed.<eos> Shit! We have to just make this call.<eos> No.<eos> Two minutes.<eos> No. Come on, let's go.<eos> You know the rules.<eos> Yep.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey. I, uh... I can't get Liz's address cos that bitch Sanger, whatever, won't give it to me.
Grandma and G-Pa aren't coming this year because they're spending Christmas with him.<eos> And I think...<eos> I don't know, I think maybe I was feeling a little jealous myself.<eos> And it made me say some things that I really don't mean.<eos> Anyway...<eos> You know, Callie is going to love that bracelet.<eos> But I hope you know you don't have to make up for her not getting adopted or for anything with a special gift.<eos> She loves you and you're special enough.<eos> Um, excuse me?<eos> I was looking at this bracelet yesterday, and I guess I put it in my pocket and forgot to pay.
I need you out of here to take care of the family.<eos> No.<eos> I can't, Ray.<eos> If you don't do it, Mickey will.<eos> If you change your mind, call the fucking bondsman.<eos> Guard!<eos> What you want, Ray?<eos> You called me ten times last night.<eos> You want to see the tape or not?<eos> Oh, I already saw it, Ray.
This is gonna hurt.<eos> No, no, no...<eos> I don't have any money.<eos> And I want any trouble.<eos> Why don't you just let us inside and open that register?<eos> No trouble just cash.<eos> And if I refuse?<eos> Things'll get messy.<eos> I can't believe you did that.<eos> Just pulled it right out...
I don't know what to say.<eos> Why don't you know what to say?<eos> You've had four fucking months to figure it out.<eos> Why come back here if you don't know what to say?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I cannot fucking believe you.<eos> You didn't come back to talk to me at all, did you?<eos> It's almost summer.<eos> You came back to sell the fucking house.<eos> Wait, what if I sold it to you?
It's almost summer.<eos> You came back to sell the fucking house.<eos> Wait, what if I sold it to you?<eos> - What?<eos> - Look, you love this place.<eos> You should have it.<eos> Make me an offer.<eos> I'm broke, Ali.<eos> You know that.<eos> Well, then I'll give it to you.
I have no energy left.<eos> So, why not?<eos> I thought the penalty was the easiest way.<eos> Bugs are biting us.<eos> My whole body is completely raw. I have sand in my part of my body.<eos> We're really fast sprinters and I thought Keith is a strong competitor, but the firemen we could definitely beat them.<eos> You guys want to take a penalty?<eos> My hands are just done.<eos> - I'm bleeding.<eos> - I say we take it.
Why don't you get the elevator?<eos> Oh, of course, my liege.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Did we have anything further to discuss?<eos> Tell Grace I said hello.<eos> Got the elevator.<eos> Well, I got it.<eos> I've been thinking a lot about that story again lately.<eos> About the Buddha leaving his family in search of meaning.<eos> It didn't really make sense to me the first time I read it.
I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> We're building an atomic bomb.<eos> It'll set off a chain reaction that will explode with the power of 20,000 tons of TNT.<eos> 20,000 tons?<eos> Powerful enough to wipe cities off the map.<eos> Cities full of people.<eos> Children.<eos> No, the army will detonate it someplace where it can't hurt anyone.
Look at me, look at me, look at me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Help me, help me.<eos> We got you.<eos> We got to get her to the car.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> Okay, we got you.<eos> She's got a pretty deep wound to her abdomen.<eos> Got it.<eos> We'll take it from here.
It still is just with a different connotation.<eos> So, was it just me... or was monsignor really zeroing in on you during his sermon.<eos> Yeah, I noticed that, too, when he was talking about Sunday Catholics as opposed to every single day Catholics.<eos> A reserved pew up front is a blessing and a curse.<eos> I thought you were gonna issue an apology for shooting your mouth off about the Church and the gays.<eos> I use it right that time?<eos> I told His Eminence I would.<eos> Apparently I am guilty of heresy until the apology is actually released.<eos> Which is when?<eos> Which is after I've written it.
Whatever it takes.<eos> But what if something goes wrong?<eos> You know, I...<eos> We don't want you to get hurt.<eos> Nothing's gonna go wrong.<eos> Dad always told me you can't live in fear.<eos> That you had to face life head-on.<eos> Funny, he spent his whole life hiding.<eos> He wanted you to know the truth, or he wouldn't have written that letter.<eos> You mind if I see it?
Right, right, right.<eos> He gives the letter to Emma, hoping that she'll be able to figure out Harvey's puzzle.<eos> There's a wrinkle, though.<eos> Sam insisted that Harvey didn't own any property, but I got a read of him with the deed to a property that Harvey owned.<eos> Dev's checking it out right now.<eos> And his will didn't mention anything about it.<eos> Maybe he was trying to hide something and forged the will.<eos> Toby was right.<eos> Harvey did own property.<eos> He bought it through Sam, had it registered to a numbered company, but I was able to trace it back to Buddy Carver.
- wrote the article.<eos> - Sure.<eos> I, uh... I have interviews booked until midnight.<eos> Hey, it's not every day that we wrap up a 25-year-old fugitive case.<eos> And solve a murder to boot.<eos> - With a little help from our buddy Oz.<eos> - Yes.<eos> The FBI took Agent Benson into custody.<eos> Turns out the gun that killed Harvey was a drop gun he carried.<eos> We found it in his hotel room.
Look, maybe this is all just a big misunderstanding.<eos> Yeah, only it's not.<eos> And now I feel like I can't trust him.<eos> You know, Russel said that rug was irreparable, but I saw it, and it was reparable.<eos> Repair... repair... re...<eos> - Fixed.<eos> Fixed.<eos> - Totally fixed.<eos> But when I confronted him, he said he didn't steal it.<eos> He liberated it.
And possibly losing my children?<eos> Enough, Lyla. Lyla, enough.<eos> I have to go pack.<eos> Grandpa's dead. Mmm. ♪ Falling on my head like a memory ♪<eos> Hurry up, Mom.<eos> We're gonna be late.<eos> Okay, okay, okay, okay.<eos> Are you wearing a backpack?<eos> No, it's a shoulder-mounted survival kit.<eos> Grandma gave it to me.
Cisco?<eos> He went home.<eos> I think our Cisco's developing a little bit of a crush on you.<eos> Not sure I'm prize winning date material anymore.<eos> Change is hard.<eos> The same accident that changed you put me in this chair.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> I don't share that story with you to garner sympathy.<eos> I tell it to you to illustrate a larger point.
Bastards won't budge.<eos> What about a court order?<eos> 24 hours, at least.<eos> How hard did you push them, Cabe?<eos> You know me.<eos> I tried as hard as I could.<eos> I've been trying to hack Vlaxco's records, but all confidential drug trials are kept on an air-gapped system.<eos> That means not connected to the Web.<eos> We can't get it.<eos> If I had another coffee cup in my hand right now, I'd smash it.
Anthrax!<eos> Last year the CDC exposed 86 of their own people to anthrax.<eos> Walter, there could be anthrax back there.<eos> Listen to me, you have no other way out.<eos> Walter, there's got to be...<eos> Walter!<eos> We see you on the security cam.<eos> I am in a dirty room, Walter.<eos> Just stay calm.<eos> Head out the east side door. Do you see it?
Why are you spending time with these kids?<eos> Because they're paying me cash to eat gross stuff.<eos> And since you took my job, I need to pay rent somehow.<eos> Hey, Nolan, for $40 will you eat a ground-up old tennis ball with peanuts?<eos> Don't do it, Nolan. You're allergic to peanuts.<eos> She's right.<eos> I'll do it for 60.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> When Jimmy sees that picture of us dancing on the table at the club, it's gonna kill him.<eos> - Did you send it?
It's your heart.<eos> I mean, this mitrial gurgle...<eos> Martrial gastral...<eos> No, no.<eos> Crosby, do you even know what mitral regurgitation is?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's a small leak in the heart valve, all right?<eos> A lot of people walk around with it, don't even know they've got it. Mmhmm.<eos> The doctor said I could've had it for years, and I never felt anything.
There you go.<eos> I'm gonna need that shiv.<eos> Red! More.<eos> Hang around for a minute.<eos> Ferguson's using you to get at me.<eos> Now it wouldn't be the first time a screw's played that game.<eos> But a Governor?<eos> That's something else.<eos> I never gave Simmo that gear.<eos> I never even had a chance to cut it before the screws confiscated it.
It's a networking opportunity.<eos> Is that really what this party is about?<eos> Isn't that what any party's ever about?<eos> I made it a costume affair on your behalf, to make you more comfortable.<eos> It's just too risky.<eos> I hate to break it to you, but I have far more important people in my circles who are doing a lot worse than you are and keeping much bigger secrets.<eos> You don't have to decide now.<eos> You just have to come.<eos> The truth is you're already wearing a mask.<eos> I'm trying to help you take it off.
Other kids like it when I'm bullied.<eos> It makes them feel safe.<eos> Nobody's ever taken my side!<eos> What do you know, dad?<eos> What do you know?<eos> What?<eos> Wearing that mask everyday...<eos> Is it some kind of a costume play?<eos> Sit down. I'm confiscating it!<eos> If you wear it again, I'll confiscate that, too!
Muddy was the magnet, and one by one, they came to Chicago.<eos> I went to Chicago, September 25, 1957.<eos> That's when the season had changed, and birds, they was getting the hell out of there as well, and I'm coming this way. And I look up and I said,<eos> "The birds got more damn sense than I got."<eos> You know, they going where the weather suits their clothes, you know?<eos> I was a New Orleans boy, you know, picking cotton on the farm.<eos> - Was your family musical?<eos> - No!<eos> I didn't know what a radio was until I was about 16-17 years old.<eos> I do know the story, and I've heard it from other people;
Cheers.<eos> Take all the guns.<eos> You should call Barosky.<eos> Tell him we need some storage for the hardware.<eos> The docks?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Somewhere his guys can keep an eye on it.<eos> What about the smack?<eos> We weren't expecting the drugs.<eos> We'll store it with the guns for now;

What does that mean?<eos> Well, he was relieved that I'm keeping you alive.<eos> So I don't think he's gonna out you.<eos> But you know we can't take any chances.<eos> Here, it's a clean burner.<eos> Here's $4,300.<eos> That's all I could get right now.<eos> I-I have money at the shop.<eos> It's the key to my dad's house, directions.<eos> They put it up for sale.
- What are you getting at?<eos> - Didn't you say he sidestepped Judge Hopkins to get a search warrant for our files?<eos> You're thinking he went around Hopkins to get authorization to follow us?<eos> I'm thinking he never got authorization at all.<eos> Then we need to get a list of the SEC's requests for surveillance by tomorrow.<eos> I have a friend at justice.<eos> Since when?<eos> Okay, I don't, but I thought it sounded cool.<eos> Mike, this is serious.<eos> We need that list, and we need it by tomorrow.
You did good work, but the truth is, if we have to turn over those files, they find that transaction.<eos> I'm gonna end up in prison.<eos> Then you and I better figure out a way to make sure Harvey wins that motion.<eos> Okay.<eos> Don't you have a funny way of giving someone space.<eos> What?<eos> Not only did you do exactly what we talked about not doing but you lied, and you used Harvey's name to do it.<eos> - I am sorry.<eos> - No, sorry's not good enough.<eos> This is the second time we've had this conversation recently, and I want to know why the hell we're having it again.
Then what the hell are you talking about?<eos> Cahill.<eos> You want us to give in?<eos> No. I'm saying he wants all the files, let's give him all the files.<eos> Rachel, what are you doing here?<eos> I told you needed some time.<eos> And then you told me that you needed to get that image out of your head.<eos> Which is why I need-<eos> No.<eos> No, it isn't because you'll never completely get it out of your head.
OK.<eos> Thanks. I always wondered about you, you know?<eos> The loner.<eos> What you were like.<eos> I just like being alone.<eos> I say that too.<eos> When anyone asks.<eos> We make these choices, don't we?<eos> About the sort of person we are.<eos> And then suddenly we are that person and it doesn't feel like we chose it.
You are nothing, kid. Nothing!<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Yeah, I know that.<eos> I even knew you thought that.<eos> But hearing it come out of your mouth.<eos> Yeah, that's quite special.<eos> Rob!<eos> Rob...<eos> Do you recognise this green hooded jumper?<eos> It belongs to the stables, we use it for the dirty jobs.
Rob, if this guy's watched the news at all, he's not going to turn up.<eos> Nobody watches the fucking news any more.<eos> It'll be fine.<eos> He'll turn up and everything will be back to normal.<eos> Now he is late.<eos> Good idea?<eos> Great idea.<eos> You know why I love weed?<eos> Makes everything a little more manageable.<eos> Do you remember the first time you smoked it?
Hey... hey.<eos> Good. What's up?<eos> Can you video chat?<eos> I hate talking on the phone.<eos> - Uh, sure.<eos> - All right, cool.<eos> My screen name's "play4change."<eos> Okay.<eos> How's the song coming?<eos> You finished it yet?
Use it now.<eos> Finish the song.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I did not take a risk.<eos> I just wanted out of the house.<eos> And you just happened to end up at my place?<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> Well, I'm starting to.<eos> And I guess I'm a little disappointed now.<eos> Look, if you finish it, give me a call if you want.
Oh!<eos> Whoa!<eos> - Hey, you know what round this is?<eos> - Third.<eos> Says it right there in the corner.<eos> Good country people, my ass.<eos> What?<eos> What happened?<eos> I just lost a bet.<eos> Truth is, I thought he had me there at the end of the first, but I saw an opportunity and I took it.
Same Burton.<eos> You want to steal a weapon for an arms dealer?<eos> If Frank doesn't, they said they'd kill me.<eos> I'm going to need hard copies of the route, as soon as you have them.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, this place is 30 minutes outside of New York.<eos> It's a top-secret research facility belonging to the NRO, the National Reconnaissance Office...<eos> The most hi-tech of the government's 16 intel agencies.<eos> They developed this weapon.<eos> Who's transporting it?

Then I'd better go.<eos> Don't you want support?<eos> No this time.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> - You're going through with this?<eos> - Obviously.<eos> If you steal that weapon, you're gonna be behind bars for the rest of your life.<eos> - Obviously not.<eos> - And if you succeed?<eos> You know what kind of man Burton is gonna sell it to.
You should know by now. I always find a way.<eos> Yeah, you always did.<eos> It doesn't mean you always will.<eos> This is a suicide mission, I'm not gonna stand here just watching you...<eos> I've made my decision.<eos> Then I've made mine.<eos> I'm resigning.<eos> I have to go.<eos> You won't be able to get hold of me until this is done.<eos> If anyone comes to that door, you don't open it, understand?
Sending your servant after me just because you lost?<eos> Stephanie Dola.<eos> either.<eos> Especially one who's getting help from another country.<eos> Shiro?<eos> One.<eos> Anyone else hiding their ears?<eos> No.<eos> That piece of flat scrap...<eos> I've seen it before.
You talk to me like that again, you're fired.<eos> We heard there was some animosity between the two of you.<eos> Fin and I had our differences.<eos> I wished he could've conducted himself more like his father.<eos> With more dignity, more... self-restraint.<eos> Was Fin aware that you felt that way?<eos> He was...<eos> He played with fire.<eos> Where were you last night during the shooting?<eos> I had the night off and was spending it at a colleague's.
Yeah, unfortunately.<eos> But she is critical and not talking.<eos> And if she does?<eos> Well, if she does...<eos> Then we'll take care of her.<eos> Did you talk to Tully?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How the hell did the chinks steal your heroin?<eos> Uh-uh. Technically, it was their heroin.<eos> They just stole it back.
Now it's just you and me.<eos> You'll be all right.<eos> Breathe! Breathe!<eos> Milner!<eos> Wilson, thank Christ it's you.<eos> I want you to meet a great man.<eos> This is Philip Carvel. What?<eos> He's Philip Carvel?<eos> Have you given the command yet?<eos> The command to release Russian flu. Have you given it?
Antoine?<eos> Oh, non, merde!<eos> What's going on?<eos> Where have you been?<eos> We tried to call, your mobile was left here on the desk.<eos> What is it?<eos> Have you found something?<eos> The people who lived opposite number 70 back in 2006... ..they got our message late last night.<eos> It seems they are big football fans.<eos> The night of the quarterfinal they threw a party... ..and they filmed it.
It seems they are big football fans.<eos> The night of the quarterfinal they threw a party... ..and they filmed it.<eos> What's on the tape?<eos> What did they film?<eos> Are you sure you want to see this?<eos> - What...?<eos> - You see that window here?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What?<eos> - We've zoomed in on it.
All right.<eos> Let's get this done.<eos> Sorry for keeping you waiting.<eos> It's okay- - Quinn showed us some Red Woody rough cuts.<eos> Business is good.<eos> Beats cranking a wrench, huh?<eos> It has its moments.<eos> I know you've talked.<eos> And you have your recommendation.<eos> Before you deliver it, I'd like to say something.
It's only a matter of time before Mr. Masterson and myself apprehend the buggers.<eos> Reach for the sky.<eos> Oh dear Lord. Please don't shoot!<eos> - Flower.<eos> - Bloody fake.<eos> How were we to know it wasn't real?<eos> - Sure looked real to me.<eos> - What were you transporting?<eos> The payroll to Grand Trunk office in Simcoe.<eos> - They got it all. - Why would Sundance and Butch kill a man?
Mr Fletcher, Governor wants to see you.<eos> Well as of 10 minutes ago, I don't work for her anymore.<eos> It's important.<eos> Well if it's a cake, you can tell her I'm not interested.<eos> I've just finished a double shift, Vera.<eos> I don't need this crap.<eos> Well, I don't know how she got it.<eos> Don't believe you.<eos> Try again.<eos> I found it on the floor.
I already have enough saved to buy her plane ticket.<eos> Your fingers are so thin, so long...<eos> Strong, white nails... Beautiful...<eos> My fingers are paralyzed... because of the shock.<eos> I went to the hospital in pain.<eos> The doctors had to cut off my wedding ring.<eos> It broke.<eos> It rolled off onto the floor and it was lost forever.<eos> Where's your wedding ring?<eos> A man with a steel hood stole it from me...
When he bailed, it was the best thing for us.<eos> And him being back is the worst.<eos> And if he stays, and you take another trip down the rabbit hole with him, you are on your own.<eos> I am not going through that again.<eos> Happy...<eos> Happy!<eos> What is this?<eos> I know you're upset. The note expresses a few things that might make you smile.<eos> I'm going toe-to-toe with Walter and you hand me a mash note?<eos> When you feel the time is right, read it, and you will understand why I gave it to you.
Get them out of here.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Awesome.<eos> She's lying.<eos> I know that face.<eos> Just spit it out, Abby.<eos> The bullet is still shifting.<eos> That's why you're in pain.<eos> I was hoping that it would stabilize by now.<eos> So how about you take it out?
She's lying.<eos> I know that face.<eos> Just spit it out, Abby.<eos> The bullet is still shifting.<eos> That's why you're in pain.<eos> I was hoping that it would stabilize by now.<eos> So how about you take it out?<eos> Raven, we need to talk about that.<eos> The bullet is pressing on your spine.<eos> If we leave it in, you'll live, but you'll never walk again.

I was born intersex.<eos> The pills I take are hormone replacements.<eos> I'm worried you're pulling away.<eos> I could never hate you.<eos> I could never hate you, either.<eos> Karma.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I thought you might want your work shirt back.<eos> I washed it.
Like, I guess I'm, like, really revved up during the day, and then when I try to sleep at night, I can't get to sleep, but...<eos> I mean, it's so funny, like, I am the happiest I've ever been in my life.<eos> So this, like, totally doesn't make sense.<eos> - You seem very anxious.<eos> - I do?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, sexy but anxious.<eos> Oh, thank you. How soon do I get the pot?<eos> Oh, no, it's not pot.<eos> We call it medicine.
Aces.<eos> Hey, what's up?<eos> I have a patient for you.<eos> Do you not remember I'm bettering myself at the Airport Shelton?<eos> The patient is at the Airport Shelton.<eos> He and his entourage have checked in just to see you.<eos> He's waiting for you right now in the presidential suite.<eos> This place has a presidential suite?<eos> Apparently so.<eos> Well, why am I not in it?
This outfit tricked taskmaster, it might work on the skull, too.<eos> Stop stealing my crazy idea schtick!<eos> Jarvis: Sir,I 'vegotsomething.<eos> Themissingmarkvi'sbeacon isnearbybutweak, asifit wereshielded.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Scanning for the suit of armor that taskmaster stole from me.<eos> Wow, he really played you.<eos> Were you planning on telling me?<eos> What?<eos> I mean, I meant to let him steal it.
I should have known the moment I met you... you're a monster.<eos> You take the most precious thing in this world... Love... and turn it into a weapon.<eos> Love is a weapon, dearie.<eos> Always has been.<eos> It's just... So few people know how to wield it.<eos> - You were right.<eos> - Get out.<eos> I don't want this infernal hand anymore.<eos> It's taken possession of me.<eos> You should have heeded my warning when I offered it.
Yes.<eos> That's how it works.<eos> Is that one of the limits you spoke of?<eos> Is that why you want the hat... to free yourself from the control of this dagger?<eos> Answer me.<eos> To be free of the control and to keep my power.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah, I can't let you walk out of here with that.<eos> So, please, give me the box.<eos> Remember, dearie, you can't keep hold of that dagger forever, and you don't want to be on the other end of it when I get it back.
I was on a ship.<eos> Which is why I was found at sea.<eos> Whose ship?<eos> It's a survey vessel.<eos> At least that's what they claimed.<eos> But I saw weapons on board.<eos> - Pretty sure it was an attack ship.<eos> - An attack... - So it was military.<eos> - Must have been.<eos> I mean, why else would they keep it on the dark side of the moon where our scientists can't see it?
What's he gonna do about it?<eos> That's the question, isn't it?<eos> - Be careful, Frank.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You too.<eos> They are OK?<eos> They're down to two trucks.<eos> What is it?<eos> Where'd you get the key?<eos> I stole it from Kedar's tent.

This is the first time we've seen each other outside the house in, like, six months.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Erasing the evidence.<eos> Do whatever feels right for you.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> I was sure I got all their phones and erased all the evidence that night.<eos> You know what I love about this picture?<eos> I think you look really happy...<eos> Free.<eos> It made me smile when I saw it.

Oh, hey.<eos> It's, uh... it's Dylan.<eos> Dylan...? Dylan.<eos> Yes, of course, the photographer.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Did your daughter tell you I stopped by today?<eos> - Oh, you were here? - Yeah, um...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I forgot to get a release form from you, so I ran it by and put it in your mailbox.<eos> And if there's any way you could scan it, email it back, that'd be great.

I got used to having you around.<eos> It's been nice.<eos> I can't keep working for Oscar.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm gonna miss you, that's it.<eos> I'll be back in time for Town Hall tonight.<eos> Does it need gas?<eos> - No.<eos> - Oh, I love this song.<eos> Catch it in the car.
But it's just, something about you drives me fucking insane.<eos> I don't think we should see each other anymore, okay?<eos> I just...<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Look, I need your help with the book.<eos> You're my insider.<eos> Okay, from now on, this is just a strictly professional relationship, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> If your hand just happens to find its way into my pants, then I will remove it promptly and admonish you for your vulgarity.
Yeah?<eos> Are you gonna remember the signal?<eos> In case he comes back?<eos> I can do it.<eos> OK.<eos> Easy as pie.<eos> I hope that's not what you said before losing a bet to him.<eos> So what does your stone do?<eos> How's it going to help bring the magic back?<eos> Well, Father Christmas uses it to slow down time so that he can deliver presents.
Should we see if they need any help?<eos> Run.<eos> Come on, he won't stay unconscious forever!<eos> Come on, quickly!<eos> Quickly!<eos> Run!<eos> Go!<eos> We made it.<eos> So is that the rock?<eos> Father Christmas uses it to slow down time.
Your intention was good.<eos> Lord Zhuge, how are things at court right now?<eos> The commoners are wavering, and the ministers are Ieaderless.<eos> The prime minister is still hesitating about releasing news of your death.<eos> He commands all the palace guards.<eos> He ordered all the generals not to dispatch troops,<eos> The nearest regular army are at Victory Pass.<eos> I want to bring them here.<eos> Do you have the imperial badge?<eos> I don't have it with me.
So we have a deal?<eos> I do hope Miss Swan's worth it.<eos> Good news.<eos> He's agreed to help.<eos> This hair is from Marian.<eos> Someone cast a freezing curse on her.<eos> We need to know who it is.<eos> Well, you're in luck.<eos> Magic can change forms but never be destroyed.<eos> We will simply return it to its natural state.
- Like what? - I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Got your nose.<eos> - That's not funny.<eos> Give it back.<eos> Give it back!<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I had a drunk uncle who took my nose when I was five at a family picnic.<eos> He had a heart attack playing softball and never gave it back.
Will you show me how?<eos> Me too. I'm... a farmer!<eos> Shall we anyway?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Martha!<eos> Your letter, I got it.<eos> It's... beautiful.<eos> But it was late, so...<eos> I'm glad you got it.
He were a right bastard, that Ingham.<eos> The children are lucky to have Mrs Allingham.<eos> She wrote me a letter.<eos> Well, I thought she did.<eos> Turned out it wasn't her.<eos> Martha...<eos> She's impossible.<eos> She's a married woman.<eos> What did you expect was going to happen, Bert?<eos> Who did write it, then?
Welcome to you all.<eos> Er, I won't be making a speech. Why?<eos> Because I want to hear from you, about your concerns and what you want.<eos> Let's make this a conversation.<eos> So, questions from the floor.<eos> Who's first?<eos> Mrs Middleton.<eos> Yes.<eos> Can the workers in your factory rely on you, Mr Allingham?<eos> Could you repeat the question a little louder, so everyone hears it?
I did it because Louis was desperate, all right?<eos> I went to see him the other day to bring him his stuff, it was just...<eos> The other day?<eos> You're telling me when you were supposed to be helping us keep our client, you were busy giving them to Louis on a silver platter?<eos> I was, but I also figured out how to get them back.<eos> - 'Cause I was trying to think of a better option.<eos> What the hell's wrong with this option?<eos> It involves going to Walter Gillis.<eos> Well, look who decided to drop by.<eos> The man who lost me my company and his partner who tore it to shreds.
I just hope you understand that if I had a choice, I never would have gone after Versalife, but I had no choice.<eos> Louis, we took them back.<eos> What?<eos> But you had to drop them.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> We convinced them to sell their trial drug division.<eos> Of course.<eos> You drop a drain on their earnings, stock price goes right through the roof.<eos> And their market share falls below the threshold.<eos> But who the hell would buy it?
Not for lack of trying.<eos> [Chuckles] So, you want to go back to my place?<eos> I think that's a capital idea.<eos> [Chuckles] Just say "yes," Dana.<eos> Don't make it weird.<eos> You need this.<eos> Peter: One sex car, coming up. [Whistles]<eos> [Stomach groans] Ohh, ooh. That's a bad feeling.<eos> Oh, okay, seriously, why do we even feed you?<eos> Why not just curdle some milk and pour it down my back?
Unh-unh. No, no, no, no, no.<eos> This is a sample from last season.<eos> If last season is a town in China, then, yes, it is.<eos> No, it's got the label, the leather, and stitchings, every... please don't tell Peter.<eos> He already thinks I'm hopelessly naive.<eos> The bigger issue is you carry around three half-eaten bananas.<eos> But... I have a surprise for you.<eos> - "Kinky Boots."<eos> - Yep, I won them at an auction.<eos> David and I have already seen it.
You're in Manhattan.<eos> Yes, yeah, taking everybody's lunch order because my boss doesn't trust me with real work is... is really... living my dream.<eos> Yeah, but you're gonna get the last laugh when your boss puts you in charge of the... Editing... Things.<eos> You have no idea what I do, do you?<eos> Not really.<eos> And the point where I should have asked passed a long time ago.<eos> - So, an editor takes a raw manuscript...<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> ...and helps shape the material into a cohesive narrative.<eos> Okay, so, for example, an editor would take your last sentence and turn it into something that I could understand.
I... look, I was proposed to before, and I haven't told you 'cause I thought my window closed.<eos> And so I'm telling you now,<eos> - but I didn't expect this whole thing to happen before...<eos> - Dana?<eos> Dana? Dana?<eos> That was awkward.<eos> Well, which part... the part where you thought<eos> I was proposing or the part where you said "maybe"?<eos> Look, I wasn't snooping.<eos> I went to find a shirt, and I found this box, and I thought it was for me, so I opened it, and I found the engagement ring.
Oliver's scarf.<eos> ~ A coincidence, perhaps.<eos> ~ No, no, no.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> I don't mean it's the KIND of scarf Oliver was wearing that night, I mean, it's exactly the one.<eos> Emily had it made for him, with his initials on it - look...<eos> ONH.<eos> You're telling me that a scarf with my son's initials on it, shows up in the same town from which he was taken, and it's a coincidence?<eos> It's his, Julien. Huh?<eos> That means someone left it somewhere.

Huh?<eos> That means someone left it somewhere.<eos> That means someone found it, and somehow it ended up with this boy.
But I'm sure you still go for that drink after work each day, yes?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> L'Esperance around the corner has Meteor on draught and a billiards table so...<eos> So life goes on for all of us.<eos> But not for Mr Hughes.<eos> Look.<eos> What he has found is real.<eos> Evidence of where his son was kept when he was taken.<eos> This is the scarf Oliver Hughes was wearing on the day he went missing.<eos> We've traced it back to a house in Chalons. 70 Rue de la Montagne.
I am not interested any more.<eos> You wanted me to let go.<eos> That man Ziane hurt you.<eos> All those surgeries...<eos> We thought you were going to lose your leg altogether.<eos> He could've killed you, Julien.<eos> And call me selfish, but no case - not Oliver Hughes or Ian Garrett - nothing is more important than having you here safe and well with me.<eos> Come on, amour.<eos> I still have one good leg.<eos> I assure you, I don't miss it.
Malik Suri called me yesterday.<eos> He knows about Ian Garrett.<eos> About what I did.<eos> How?<eos> He didn't say.<eos> Just that he has enough to go to print.<eos> Well, he doesn't have any proof.<eos> The only proof is...<eos> The shirt, I know.<eos> And I destroyed it.
It was nice.<eos> - It was?<eos> We should stay in bed all day, right?<eos> Come on. When was the last time either one of us was able to do something like that?<eos> Gosh, I can't even remember.<eos> I can.<eos> Hey, Sean.<eos> No, no, no, I was up.<eos> I left my bracelet in the top drawer of my dresser, and now it's gone.<eos> Are you sure you didn't just misplace it?

[Knock at door] How's it going in there, Miss?<eos> Do you need any help?<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It says here, when it was built in 1875, the light was the strongest on the East Coast, and it's one of only 12 lighthouses in the country still equipped with a first-order Fresnel lens.<eos> Impressive.<eos> No, no.<eos> The Fresnel lens is incredible.<eos> Fresnel was this French physicist who had the idea to take a glass lens and cut grooves in it in concentric circles.<eos> And each groove acts like a prism that refracts the source light and concentrates it into a beam that can be seen much further away using a much thinner piece of glass.
Table for one?<eos> I'm here to see Tien.<eos> I don't know any Tien.<eos> He's expecting me.<eos> Damian Blake.<eos> It's Damian Blake.<eos> He wants to see Tien.<eos> You got ID?<eos> I'd like that back.<eos> You'll get it back.
She was really talking about herself.<eos> She and Blake were working against the government.<eos> Okay, we just watched Agent Wolfe...<eos> She shot him, right in front of us.<eos> Yeah, well, she had to.<eos> To keep him from being questioned, or he would end up exposing her.<eos> Blake could never succeed.<eos> He would just end up being arrested with the weapon and the investigation would have fallen out of her hands.<eos> Shit, if you're right, she's an evil genius.<eos> Yeah, and if Frank hands her that weapon, he'll just be giving it to the terrorists he's trying to stop.
I know you're used to acting alone<eos> But this time is different<eos> A minor mistake will ruin it all<eos> Think about it<eos> You don't trust me<eos> You can't go to Hawk empty-handed<eos> This is Luan's Advance Map<eos> - The real map?<eos> - A fake map won't fool Hawk<eos> I made a copy and sent it to HQ
I just thought of it.<eos> I don't have that kind of money.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, I think you can get it.<eos> So I'll give you a week, and then I'll tell her.<eos> Have a safe trip.<eos> I got your cell.<eos> Thank you so much, Mom.<eos> And this beautiful face.<eos> What am I going to do when I can't see it every day?
Do you remember those giant Oreos we had when we were kids?<eos> They were, like... like, as big as your face.<eos> What happened to those?<eos> Did I...<eos> Did I dream them?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I found his address.<eos> Jesus, how?<eos> Technology.<eos> I'm emailing it to you.
I'm going to the store.<eos> What? No.<eos> This is your apartment.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I need something.<eos> The coke is gone.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> I...<eos> - I mean it's gone.<eos> We buried it, we went to dig it up, and it wasn't there.
I mean, it's ok, maybe you wanted to get online or-<eos> But I didn't.<eos> After I saw you coming up from downstairs, my computer was on.<eos> And then today a very important file went missing.<eos> I went downstairs to get a glass of water.<eos> Why would I do something to your computer?<eos> Why would I do something to your file?<eos> I don't know, Caitlin, that's why I'm asking.<eos> Did you accuse Caitlin of messing with your computer?<eos> I asked her if she had used it.
I take back every mean thing I ever said about you.<eos> It doesn't mean we're gonna charge him.<eos> It's still very difficult to prove.<eos> And you're gonna prove it, sis.<eos> Dan...<eos> That's why you get the big bucks. Right?<eos> I know you can prove it.<eos> Ooh. Seriously, Pop?<eos> Whoa, you're not sending my lucky shirt to Goodwill.<eos> The only thing lucky about that shirt is that Grandma never saw you in it. Ha-ha.
Did you guys know that Halle Berry's opening a yogurt store?<eos> It's called Very Berry Berry.<eos> I saw that.<eos> What an amazing story.<eos> Yeah, riveting.<eos> All right, well, let's get to you guys.<eos> Nolan, you want to start?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I was wondering if I could get my pot back.<eos> I know I said I didn't want to get high and not to give it back to me under any circumstances,
That's what I thought, too.<eos> All right, I'm going to go grab him.<eos> So buckle in.<eos> You're about to get hit with a tsunami... of mental health.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Can't you tell?<eos> Let me "Reefer" you to this big, fat doobie.<eos> Where did you get weed?<eos> It was in the nightstand in the guest bedroom.<eos> I thought you left it for me.
Sorry.<eos> We just need to get this staff meeting started, so...<eos> - Oh. Okay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, uh, I'll talk to you later.<eos> Yeah, absolutely.<eos> Bye, Emma.<eos> Okay, what was that about?<eos> She took the picture of you and Cinco and sold it to Snarkhampton.
It's all good.<eos> Good.<eos> Okay, so I've got the Henderson twins' vaccinations at 10:00 and Ms. Newberg's annual physical at noon.<eos> Which, of course, will turn into a three-Martini lunch.<eos> For her, not for me.<eos> I've got back-to-back patients needing MRIs.<eos> You're lending me your Navy tie, Henry.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> I love that tie.<eos> - And you won't return it.
What are you doing here?<eos> Oh, you know, I was just in the neighbs, thought I'd drop by, see how things are going for you...<eos> At school... With your grades.<eos> Well, actually, I just got an email from Professor Straf.<eos> Yeah, it turns out he re-read my paper and changed the grade.<eos> Oh, did he now?<eos> And what pray tell did he change it to?<eos> A C-minus.<eos> What?<eos> He lowered it?
Adam, listen to me.<eos> We have worked too hard to get what we have.<eos> And we've done amazing things for this community.<eos> You cannot throw away our future.<eos> Think about Trey.<eos> How was work today, honey?<eos> Can I make you a martini?<eos> Maxine is pissed.<eos> The kitchen's a mess.<eos> I called her and I told her I'd clean it up when I got back.
Martin...<eos> I know you don't think so, but it's a good thing, letting us watch your back tomorrow.<eos> We're gonna stop these guys.<eos> Right?<eos> Don't worry, Bobby.<eos> We'll get 'em.<eos> Your flight's in two hours.<eos> We'll be an hour behind you.<eos> The Chicago field office is prepped for your arrival.<eos> Streeter will have eyes on it.
- No, no.<eos> - Now, think of your head.<eos> - Yes. Think with your head.<eos> "Torgeir Lien"...<eos> Roar, the fucking...<eos> You are only a blood clot in my brain.<eos> Thrombosis?<eos> You do not believe in the nonsense?<eos> - I believe in science and stuff.<eos> - So how do you explain the science you can text of "The Minstrel Boy" if you've never heard it before?
Okay, so do something about it.<eos> Push through the expansion deal.<eos> Show your father that you have foresight<eos> - and business sense.<eos> - Enough, Petra!<eos> It's none of your business! __ - Oh, sorry.<eos> Looking for Michael.<eos> - You just missed him.<eos> Is his bag in there, because I want to stick something in it?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I'll-I'll grab it for you.
Okay, here's what we're gonna do, uh...<eos> You are going to help me put him in a chair.<eos> Okay, but if this guy leaks dead-guy juice on me, I'm gonna freak out.<eos> Actually, you know what?<eos> I think we should use your... your shirt.<eos> What?<eos> You want me to give you...? No, no.<eos> No.<eos> This is my favorite shirt.<eos> You're not putting it on a dead guy.
In every way.<eos> He has to take me when he wants, where he wants.<eos> I'm just Woman. just a sex object for this man.<eos> And I need that.<eos> And I like it.<eos> You're right.<eos> I swear...<eos> Seriously. How are you getting home?<eos> - Leave your horn here.<eos> - I'll take it.

Seriously. How are you getting home?<eos> - Leave your horn here.<eos> - I'll take it.<eos> - Leave it here.<eos> - I'll drop it off tomorrow.<eos> - By bus.<eos> I promise.<eos> - With the graveyard shift.<eos> I'm the Fuhrer of this party.<eos> - I'll take it with me.
- Come, my dear.<eos> Nothing is more tedious than other people's misfortunes.<eos> - Let us just be grateful to Lady Grantham. - Hm!<eos> Last time we met, the circumstances were rather different.<eos> - I don't remember.<eos> - I think you do.<eos> Ah! There's a note here for a Mrs Brennan. Who's that?<eos> - The cook. Why?<eos> - As I say, somebody's left a note for her.<eos> So you better take it in.
- Oh.<eos> - I don't think I should.<eos> - Go on!<eos> It's Christmas.<eos> Let's toast your new house.<eos> Maybe I should mention one thing.<eos> You say...'your new house', but it isn't only mine.<eos> - No?<eos> - No.<eos> I've registered it in both of our names.
Was anyone else hurt?<eos> My friends...<eos> I'll ask.<eos> Stop.<eos> Your mum said I could come and meet you if I promised to bring you straight home.<eos> People are struggling.<eos> Things aren't so easy to come by.<eos> But no-one complains.<eos> They say the food's all going to the soldiers fighting.<eos> If it is, I haven't seen it!
Uh... how much more obvious can I be?<eos> We're not a thing.<eos> - But...<eos> - Look, I just don't like you that way.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Just turn it off.<eos> Hey.<eos> You set the alarm to watch the wedding.<eos> Don't not watch it because you're pissed at me.
Whether or not I'm stable-- fascinating question.<eos> I've personally treated many mentally unstable people.<eos> Dated some, too.<eos> You're trying to game me again, Mr. Curtis.<eos> Answer my question.<eos> I'm rock steady.<eos> The only reason we disregarded Cabe's orders is because we had to chase Daniels.<eos> He could have led us to the painting.<eos> Through busy downtown streets.<eos> Government employees are supposed to protect property, not destroy it.
I'd still be there if it weren't for Walter.<eos> He's pretty exceptional.<eos> Don't tell him I said that.<eos> You spooked him.<eos> He won't talk.<eos> The FBI gave us one hour with him and we're at zero.<eos> That's what happens when a guy gets chased by a bunch of weirdos in a van covered in chicken feathers.<eos> The FBI searched his house, his storage locker, his records, everything, turned up nothing.<eos> The painting's worth $100 mil.<eos> If he doesn't talk fast, we'll never see it again.
Just like the painting.<eos> Use the built-in Wi-Fi.<eos> Got full bars.<eos> We're in.<eos> We got control of his car.<eos> Cutting engine power.<eos> Raising engine temp.<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> Painting's in the trunk.<eos> Agents are en route, they'll take it to the museum.
A place to reach their potential""<eos> Doesn't sound like you.<eos> That hurts.<eos> I doubt that.<eos> But it got me thinking about some things that didn't make sense.<eos> Like when you hacked Paulson's car and it didn't exactly work as planned.<eos> Well, technology's not always reliable.<eos> It is when you guys do it.<eos> So then I went down to the evidence locker to look for the fake painting.<eos> Couldn't find it.
I tweaked the resonator and got this.<eos> It's on every frequency.<eos> Long-range communication is totally screwed.<eos> It's also why the range in our walkies sucks.<eos> It's the same signal Monty heard on the black box of the exodus ship.<eos> Mount Weather crashed the exodus ship.<eos> Can you get around the signal?<eos> Around it?<eos> No.<eos> But if I can get to the tower that broadcasts it, I can make it go boom.
Oh, Lincoln.<eos> Octavia.<eos> If Alpha's on the ground, maybe other stations are, too.<eos> You're from Alpha, right?<eos> My dad was chief guard.<eos> He sure loved having a thief for a kid.<eos> Hey.<eos> You're a great thief.<eos> These are the engineering schematics for this whole place.<eos> If there's a way out, we're gonna find it.
They'd believe he was the shooter.<eos> Sick bitch.<eos> Raven, you don't mean this.<eos> You know what they do to people.<eos> They want a murderer, we'll give them one.<eos> Drop your gun.<eos> Go to hell, Raven.<eos> Put it down, Raven.<eos> Like it or not, he's one of us.<eos> I said drop it.
The only life I have is here.<eos> Yeah, I thought that once in Mississippi.<eos> Train ride changed all that.<eos> I intend to stay and accept the consequences for what I've done.<eos> You'll stay, and you'll die.<eos> For what... teach everybody some lesson about right and wrong?<eos> It's not your responsibility to save me, Mr. Bohannon.<eos> You're getting on that train.<eos> - I've made my decision. - Yeah?<eos> Well, I just unmade it.
Stronger is what you need, right?<eos> Sure...<eos> Ruby, it is not your job to feed them.<eos> You're taking after your daddy, hanging mens up in trees.<eos> Last thing they swallow, might as well be sweet.<eos> How are they?<eos> They won't die before they're hanged.<eos> Twice as drunk and twice as wild.<eos> Gallows dirt on your hands.<eos> Wash it off, else the spirits smell it.
~ Please.<eos> Proctologist?<eos> You're never going to get it.<eos> I'm not going to try.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's make it a game.<eos> I'll describe to you... .. my day at work, and you stop me when you've guessed it.<eos> 'The extreme weather has hit sales hard this Christmas.<eos> 'Five inches of snow...'<eos> 'That's going to wreck my portfolio just when I need it.'
What an idiot!<eos> I won't allow you to speak ill of him.<eos> I'm going to bed.<eos> I won't allow you to speak ill of A-Tuo.<eos> I so: m.<eos> "Put Shit In Your Heart"<eos> What a coincidence!<eos> That guy... ls cabbage allowed in the library?<eos> Yes, as long as I don't eat it.<eos> How can I eat it as I spray preservative on it every day?
If Falcone finds out you're alive, he'll kill us both!<eos> I got no place else to go.<eos> Gotham is my home.<eos> I should've killed you!<eos> I should put a bullet in your head right now!<eos> And you would have every right to do so.<eos> But you won't, Jim Gordon, because you're a good man.<eos> You may very well be the last good man in Gotham, and that's why I want to help you!<eos> - I don't want your help!<eos> - No, no, but you need it.
I can't even begin to answer that.<eos> Can't or won't?<eos> Montoya.<eos> She came to see you, didn't she?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why does she keep coming to you?<eos> What is there between you and her?<eos> Years ago, before I was with you..., she and I... were in a relationship.<eos> What?<eos> It only lasted a year..., and then I... I ended it and moved on.
You think that semicolon was a mistake?<eos> No, it was a juicy piece of bait, and she unhinged her jaw and swallowed it whole.<eos> So you wanted her to say no to us?<eos> Rejecting a valid request for such a petty reason, that's all the ammunition I need to go over her head.<eos> I secretly scheduled us a one-on-one with Madeline's boss, chief Fisker.<eos> You wanna hear the funniest thing ever?<eos> I also split and infinitive, and she didn't notice.<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> Did you check out the department video camera by any chance?<eos> Yeah, I was gonna take it home and videotape the top of my head.

What's on it?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just really need it for no reason.
Nothing sabotaged me one bit.<eos> Yep. You said it.<eos> Well, see you later.<eos> Where can I grab a nosh?<eos> Oh, craft services is in the kitchen.<eos> Up the driveway, through the living room, make a left.<eos> - Can't miss it.<eos> - I'm gonna grab a quick bite.<eos> Don't do anything stupid while I'm gone.<eos> Okay, fellas, here's the thing about the story. I don't buy it.
Who exactly should we blame for this unmitigated disaster,<eos> Mr. Mitchell?<eos> Mr. Hadden-<eos> You vouched for the authenticity and you delivered a forgery.<eos> Mr. Hadden, I'm really sorry but in my line of work people have a tendency to lie.<eos> Is that so, Mr. Mitchell?<eos> I was going on information supplied by your contacts, sir.<eos> Yes, and you were supposed to vet this information, am I correct?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You could have gone and interrogated the chap who gave it to you, but that would have been too difficult, wouldn't it?
He wants you to come to Vienna to discuss you and your father's life's work.<eos> He thought it would be better if he had your<eos> Get him out!<eos> Up the stairs!<eos> Who was that guy and why was he shooting at you?<eos> He wasn't shooting at me, he was aiming for you!<eos> He was what?<eos> The thirteenth skull is still out there and there are people who would do anything to stop it from being found.<eos> Including fanatics like that guy.<eos> Well if Hadden wanted my undivided attention, he certainly has it now.
But now I must confer with NATO and come up with our own method.<eos> Brute force will not work!<eos> You saw what happened when your men attempted to attack the skulls!<eos> They have an impregnable field around them!<eos> That was four men.<eos> I'm talking about some stronger medicine.<eos> We know force won't work. What Will?<eos> The thirteenth skull.<eos> But the dilemma is I have no idea where to begin to look for it.<eos> I want you to follow your father's footsteps and find it.
You're in charge, Todd.<eos> Keep this dummy out of trouble.<eos> Hooray, responsibility.<eos> Hey.<eos> Do you really believe all that stuff you said to me earlier about me being smart and talented and good?<eos> BoJack, I'm an agent.<eos> I believe everything I say.<eos> Ah.<eos> Hey, where the hell is that cheeseburger?<eos> I ordered it, like, an hour ago.
Now, the shooter was smart enough to wipe the gun clean.<eos> But he forgot the inside of the bottle when he shoved the rags in the silencer.<eos> Prints match an Alex Weaver. Guy's already done time for gun possession,<eos> - now we got him on first degree.<eos> - Yeah. Homicide had him dead to rights, but they couldn't make the case stick without the evidence.<eos> We scoured that neighborhood, Sergeant...<eos> I mean scoured. I can't even tell you how many man hours.<eos> Sean already called Detective Schember in area north Violent Crimes.<eos> Thinks they'll get a confession now, at worst.<eos> - Won't need it anyway.
Okay, from now on, full truth, warts and all.<eos> You're not gonna make me look like an asshole, are you?<eos> I don't know, are you an asshole?<eos> Okay, full truth, here we go.<eos> You want to know about my parents?<eos> They drank a lot.<eos> My father was a failed novelist.<eos> My mother was the heiress to the Sugarman sugar cubes fortune, and my dad resented her for it.<eos> He used to make me cry with him while listening to Cole Porter records.<eos> He made me build my own tree house, and then he tore it down while I was at summer camp because instead of hearty, Christian nails, I used screws, which he called fancy Jew nails.
Morning, Keith.<eos> Morning.<eos> Morning, Sarah.<eos> Good morning, Keith.<eos> Doc, can I make you a cup of tea?<eos> Sarah just made me one, thanks. Oh!<eos> Did she indeed?<eos> I see the picture I bought you is still here.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Are you not going to take it home?
I've got a roof rack.<eos> Didn't know that about me, did you, that I have a roof rack?<eos> I could pop it round on Saturday.<eos> I'll stick it up.<eos> What?<eos> Well, once Churchy's dropped it round, he can sod off and I'll get on with the banging.<eos> Do not let him inside your house, Sarah.<eos> Look, I'm not sure I want to put it up anyway.<eos> But I thought you said you liked it.<eos> You're going to have to do something with that monstrosity, because you can't leave it here.
Amy, are you sure?<eos> You know what they say.<eos> If you love something, set it free.<eos> Happy birthay, Karma.<eos> Well, I'm guessing I shoul start by reaing your note.<eos> Or you coul just tell me what it says.<eos> It says...<eos> Happy birthay.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I rewrote it a million times an then I figure... Keep it simple.
I want to be here.<eos> You know, when I heard about what happened, I was really worried.<eos> I just...<eos> I'm-I'm just glad you're okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Can we, um, scroll forward frame by frame?<eos> I think we might get something.<eos> That's him.<eos> Okay, let me zoom in.<eos> I'll isolate his face, run it through facial recognition.
Well, we'll figure it out.<eos> It's some shaving cream and stuff.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Look, I got to get downstairs to work.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I got to go, too.<eos> Here's a key.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I understand your frustration here, Mr. Page.<eos> But in order for me to issue a warrant for a DNA test for someone for a crime that was committed 11 years ago who wasn't even a suspect, I'm gonna need probable cause.<eos> And you're not giving it to me.

It's not gonna happen, Adam.<eos> I'm sorry, I can't do it.<eos> If it's a question of waiting in line, I will.<eos> No, man, I had it all ready to go.<eos> I mean, it was gonna take some time.<eos> It wasn't exactly a well-handled piece of evidence, but I was ready.<eos> - Okay, so what happened?<eos> - Get this.<eos> I get a call from the Jersey State Supreme Court office.<eos> Some judge wants to know what case this evidence is for and why I'm testing it in Jersey.
Cornelius.<eos> Father.<eos> Let me get our big baby boy.<eos> Look at you, John, a regular frontiersman.<eos> Mr. Caze!<eos> Mr. Caze was kind enough to fill me in.<eos> He tells me there's a mine, and miners short on pay.<eos> You're emptying my pockets.<eos> The mine belongs to me.<eos> - I sunk it.
Dime for a drink?<eos> Help an old friend?<eos> Jared was there, and he's dead.<eos> Little, too.<eos> And I'm three!<eos> Don't come too close.<eos> Man shared a couple of drinks with me.<eos> Talk going round about Thomas, is it true?<eos> There's talk?<eos> He loses that leg, you'll be the one to take it?
You going to stand by and let her?<eos> You believe Dr. Blithely would have me standing by?<eos> Mr. Caze.<eos> I have come to ask a favour of you.<eos> A private matter.<eos> Anything within my means, missus.<eos> I was hoping for the lend of a good sharp hacksaw.<eos> Wood needs cutting, I can tend to that.<eos> Hacksaw'd be the wrong blade.<eos> I would use it to sever Dr. Thomas's femur, the large bone in his upper leg.
Take off your clothes.<eos> You intend to bed down out here?<eos> Your Thomas is going to the grave.<eos> Needn't join him.<eos> I waited too long.<eos> I should have made him see.<eos> I could have saved him.<eos> Can't push back death that wants a man.<eos> Everyone knows the doc made his own bed that way.<eos> Couldn't face life half-made, so now he's leaving it.
I couldn't help but overhear that aria you were humming.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> It's my favorite.<eos> Mine, too.<eos> Ah, well, there you go.<eos> I'm sorry, I-I just...<eos> I-I didn't mean to bother you.<eos> My mother sang that to me when I was young.<eos> Her whole life, she sang that to me.<eos> I hadn't heard it in a while, and I...
Because it sounds like you are.<eos> And we keep going around and around and I keep telling you that I don't have a choice.<eos> Barbara...<eos> This city... the law, the crime here, they're all... twisted up at each other like a maze.<eos> I came here to be a cop.<eos> This city needs something else.<eos> So, okay... I understand.<eos> I'm just asking for one thing:<eos> half of what you have to carry.<eos> God knows I've... I've dumped my half on you and you carry it.
I just busted up your gams and put you in that chair.<eos> Gotham's Golden Rule.<eos> No heroes, Bullock.<eos> No heroes.<eos> Listen, Dix.<eos> We have to talk about the case.<eos> About the Goat.<eos> I was wondering when you were going to come and ask for my help.<eos> I'm not asking for your help.<eos> That don't mean you don't need it.
Watch out for him.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Why's that?<eos> He's a loose cannon.<eos> He thinks he's a white knight jumping into the breach like some idiot in the movies.<eos> You're talking about Bullock here?<eos> We're talking about Bullock here.<eos> Harvey Bullock?<eos> Harvey Bullock, yeah.<eos> Detective Bullock, do you want to settle the bill for this month now or should we send it to you?
Why hypnotize a janitor and turn him into the Goat?<eos> - You wouldn't understand.<eos> - Try me.<eos> It isn't an act of murder or madness.<eos> It's an act of therapy.<eos> - Therapy?<eos> For who?<eos> - For Gotham.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> This city used to have hope, and they gunned it down in the streets.
Yes, you do.<eos> Anyway, there was this table in that movie, and they were always laughing around it and eating on plates with candles, and the whole house just seemed so fresh and beachy.<eos> Of course, it was actually at the beach, so that probably did...<eos> What?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We're not gonna get it.<eos> Who says? Let...<eos> Let's do it. Why not?<eos> Mike, we're trying to save for college, and we already have a table.<eos> We'll give it to Axl.
Are you serious?<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> We've been working our butts off.<eos> It's our 20-something-th anniversary.<eos> And besides, the next time we splurge on something made of wood, it'll probably be coffins. Oh!<eos> Come on.<eos> It'll be our gift to each other.<eos> But it seems so extravagant.<eos> I mean, can we really do that?<eos> Frankie, you've been complaining about that table since the day we got it.
Oh, you don't think I tried that?<eos> It did not go well.<eos> For people who make tiny furniture for the pleasure of children, they're real douche bags.<eos> Well, guess there's only one thing we can do.<eos> We got to replace the rest of our stuff with tiny stuff, or this table is gonna look ridiculous.<eos> Oh, Mike, I'm sorry.<eos> I was dumb. I was so dumb!<eos> Eh, it's not your fault.<eos> It's both of ours.<eos> We tried to find joy, and the universe clearly does not want us to have it.
You needed it to save Mason.<eos> You're the one who killed Turk and Messner.<eos> Your original plan wasn't too bad.<eos> I mean, you heard the rumblings around school that Turk was looking for the Chem IV test answers.<eos> It's pretty easy, setting him up.<eos> This is you entering the school library at 1:16.<eos> That's the same day that Chet Messner was killed.<eos> And at 1:19, you logged on to a computer using Hannah Hunt's password.<eos> You logged on to VidTree, and you sent a message to Rob Turkla.<eos> Telling him where to find the cheat sheet, but Messner found it instead.
Tell me you didn't kill a pregnant woman.<eos> Oh, that's totally what happened.<eos> Why else would today be his personal hell?<eos> Oh, here we go.<eos> The only reason that you're alive right now is because I thought you could get us out of here and you could help us, but you don't have any answers.<eos> You're just a man-child with jam on your fingers!<eos> Ok then.<eos> To get home, we'll harness the power of the eclipse using a mystical relic.<eos> It's called an ascendant, and it looks like this, Damon.<eos> The last time we had it was in the pacific northwest.
Thanks, jj.<eos> If the pilot or copilot was working with the terrorists, That would explain the argument in the cockpit.<eos> Now, the copilot admits he shut down the acars, But the grad student was living with the pilot, So maybe they were all in on it.<eos> Hey.<eos> I've been meaning to ask, how you holding up?<eos> It's never going to be easy,<eos> But I'm managing.<eos> We just picked up cole marshak.<eos> Seems marshak and his clan, they're engagers, not instigators.<eos> They'd join a war but not start it.
You can do this.<eos> We don't have time for this.<eos> We can't stop yet!<eos> This is our last chance to test the new strains.<eos> No!<eos> They don't look like volunteers to me.<eos> Millions of people are dying for no reason.<eos> These men are gonna die to help us find a vaccine.<eos> If it works, one of them may outlive us all.<eos> Yeah, well why don't you take it then, huh?
You're right, but he refused.<eos> DST has dropped everything and tapped into all the security-camera footage near Auggie's building.<eos> We can only get a partial on the plates, but we're scouring satellite footage as we speak, trying to piece together the van's escape route.<eos> What about the assailants-- any clear visuals?<eos> Well, one of them is still a question mark...<eos> But the other one... is Allen Langer, your former employee.<eos> That explains how he was able to take my operative down.<eos> Langer knows the security protocols.<eos> We found the van.<eos> We tracked it to a warehouse in Baltimore.
Wh...<eos> Daycia tempted you in some way?<eos> What? With alcohol?<eos> I woke up...<eos> to go the bathroom in the middle of the night.<eos> It must have been just past 4:00.<eos> I got back to my room.<eos> There was a bottle sitting on my nightstand.<eos> A bottle of bourbon, my brand, with a damn ribbon on it.<eos> And-and you think that Daycia put it there.

You know you want some.<eos> Stop it. Don't make me drink all by myself.<eos> Mmm. She wouldn't stop.<eos> She wouldn't back off.<eos> She just kept at it.<eos> She kept trying to get me to drink.<eos> Look, all I wanted to do was shut her up.<eos> with the pillow, I mean.<eos> I mean, come on, it was a pillow.<eos> I put it over her face just to get her to stop talking.
I'm not gonna throw my life away.<eos> I'm... sorry.<eos> The bathtub in Daycia's room was already full, so I thought, why not... why not just make it look like an accident?<eos> Make it look like she just... slipped away.<eos> I put her in the water.<eos> I got the piece of tubing from the fish tank, and I made it look like she drowned.<eos> Insane part of this whole thing is, I made it, you know that?<eos> I didn't drink.<eos> Even after she was dead and it was quiet in that room.<eos> I took that bottle, and I poured it in the toil... toilet.
Hmm. What did she project onto you?<eos> She began acting provocatively, attempting to seduce me, but I viewed it as a breakthrough.<eos> Hmm, a breakthrough. To what?<eos> To the transference.<eos> Where the gold is.<eos> See, the fact that she is behaving that way, showed me that this was a core issue of hers.<eos> - But not yours.<eos> - Carisi?<eos> Thank you.<eos> So... doctor, once you noticed the transference, did you discourage it?
But for me...<eos> So I need something to be good.<eos> I need a reason to get up every morning, to not crawl back to that cave that I was in before I met her.<eos> I mean, you know she saved me?<eos> You were there.<eos> You remember how I was.<eos> I was... dark.<eos> That war made me dark.<eos> And that darkness... it is still in me.<eos> She just lit it up.
Almost done here, Jerry.<eos> You should have gone home hours ago.<eos> Who's Jerry?<eos> This place is bigger than my apartment.<eos> What are you guys doing here?<eos> You asked us to analyze the DNA off the arrow that killed Sara.<eos> I was just going to mail you the sample.<eos> We had some vacation days coming--<eos> We want to see the Arrow cave.<eos> We don't call it that.
Barry...<eos> Starling General's at Eighth and Wilcott.<eos> HKPF IDed her as Sumilu Kang.<eos> She was a student at the University of Hong Kong.<eos> A biology textbook in her backpack.<eos> Apparently she was studying to become a veterinarian.<eos> He would have told me.<eos> I just needed more time.<eos> No, Mr. Queen, what you needed was conviction.<eos> And the men who do things like this have it.
Yes!<eos> Yes, 'cause now she wants to hold hands with me, and they're so delicate and beautiful.<eos> She keeps drawing me offsides.<eos> "Hold my hand!" and I jump.<eos> It's a disease, Pete.<eos> And you are like patient zero, so get it under control!<eos> Get it under control. Okay, I don't want to hold hands, anyway.<eos> It's fine. Then don't do it! No more!<eos> Then don't hold hands.<eos> Shake on it, no more hand holding. Okay, we're shaking.
Talk about what?<eos> I mean, what do you need to talk to Sharon about?<eos> Something... personal, dad, okay?<eos> - O-okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Uh, Mr. Sherman, this is...<eos> Mr. Sh...<eos> Mr. Sherman, this is Lieutenant Provenza, who had your client brought to the hospital, and this is Lieutenant Tao, who understands your business a little bit better than I do.<eos> I consult on a TV show starring Jon Worth... "Badge of Justice."<eos> Never seen it.
What kind of chores?<eos> I...<eos> Was not prepared for you to ask me that question.<eos> Andrew!<eos> Andrew, come in here!<eos> Oh, gosh, there's... there's a really big spider.<eos> - Ugh! It's right there.<eos> - Okay, okay, okay.<eos> It's a big spider.<eos> I need you to kill it.
We got bodies.<eos> Salazar.<eos> Grenade!<eos> You guys okay?<eos> Better than Salazar's gang.<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> These guys didn't even put up a struggle.<eos> I think Mattias used them.<eos> He must have found out about G's reward.<eos> Used it against us to lure us out. So where is he?
One person start untying that first one. First one. John's going to take the rope<eos> John's going to take the rope wbo coyopa and hook it up there.<eos> Big learning curve to this. Big learning curve to this.<eos> You've got to launch it. You've got to launch it. damn!<eos> jeff: Johntryinganother jeff: Johntryinganother approach.<eos> It is a lot more difficult than<eos> It is a lot more difficult than it looks. It looks. That rope is very heavy.<eos> That rope is very heavy. And you've got a very small<eos> And you've got a very small window to latch it in up there.<eos> Window to latch it in up there. John hooks it for coyopa!
I don't know.<eos> We should show 'em to his wife.<eos> Maybe she knows something.<eos> I'm gonna send this to Abby first, and then we can...<eos> No wonder Angus and his wife were having problems.<eos> Hey!<eos> Get off my property!<eos> It's a fair offer.<eos> I'd rather lose my building to the bank than sell it to you.<eos> Then I'll buy it from the bank.
We just wanted to talk to you about how these relationships between young boys and girls work.<eos> Mmhmm. I know how they work.<eos> - You know how they work.<eos> - Oh, well, okay.<eos> That's probably true, but here's the thing.<eos> Your dad and I have been in a relationship for so long that we are practically experts at it, and we've learned a lot along the way, so we wanted to share our knowledge with you.<eos> Normally to become an expert in something, you have to not just have done it for a long time but have an advanced degree as well.<eos> Well, they don't hand out advanced degrees in relationships, Max, but if they did...<eos> - They should.<eos> - We'd have it.

Oh, my gosh.<eos> All right, that's right.<eos> Why don't you guys erase that picture?<eos> No, no, come on, ser-seriously, guys.<eos> Okay, all right.<eos> Stop, erase that photo.<eos> No way.<eos> It's perfect for our web site.<eos> What web site?<eos> You haven't seen it?
I can go sexy.<eos> I'd settle for sober.<eos> Just go over to him, tell him how much I admire him, his worth ethic, blah, blah, blah...<eos> Babe, I got this. Good.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay. I would like a martini.<eos> No.<eos> Gimlet?<eos> Thank you. The shrimp needs to be chilled, not frozen.<eos> When you freeze it, ice crystals form. Mr. Lipscome.
I deserve it!<eos> This is not good.<eos> It worked.<eos> Beautifully.<eos> You're fallen.<eos> I have to admit, I thought a ghoul Would deliver me the feather, but thank you, zed.<eos> Looks like my protection spell To keep evil out is keeping evil in.<eos> A fallen angel finds a desperate bloke, Intercepts him at the gates of hell And makes him think it's the gates of heaven.<eos> Zachary didn't take your feather.<eos> You put it in his hand so you could break through to earth.
How did you two know each other?<eos> Well, back in Jurassic times, I fronted a punk band called Mucous Membrane.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> I wasn't always an upstanding warlock.<eos> Bernie here produced our first and only record.<eos> He tried his best, but... to tell you the truth, we were just a bunch of wankers trying to get laid. And here we are.<eos> Reunited for one final comeback tour.<eos> Courtesy of... this!<eos> Hand of Glory.<eos> You take the left hand of a man that's been hanged, pickle it in amniotic fluid for seven years, say the right incantation, and the dead will rise for as long as the candles burn.
The super capacitors... the containment field is fluctuating.<eos> They need to get out of there now.<eos> The reason I know all this is because your powers are almost exactly like those of The Flash.<eos> Oh, I'm not like The Flash at all.<eos> Some would say I'm the reverse.<eos> Dr. Wells, evacuate!<eos> Get out of there now!<eos> Dr. Wells!<eos> Cisco, turn off the barrier!<eos> If I turn it off, that thing's gonna get out.
Mrs Sweeting, did you know that Mandy was pregnant with Antony's child?<eos> - No.<eos> - She was.<eos> - Did Gary know?<eos> - We don't know.<eos> How do you know Antony did it?<eos> It's grim.<eos> It involves blood.<eos> He always wanted everything Gary had.<eos> He'd take a biscuit off him, take a bite, throw it to the floor.
There's a nice set around the neck.<eos> Yeah, that's as you'd expect.<eos> Strangled?<eos> He dies.<eos> His blood pools.<eos> Then the rest of the beating happens postmortem, which gives bruises and no blood.<eos> Done this before?<eos> Gifted amateur.<eos> The towel position's a bit weird.<eos> He's not gone down wearing it.
It was.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, if the door had been broken the night before, why did you feel shocked to see it like that 24 hours later?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm confused.<eos> Me too.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Take a minute.<eos> It was bust open by Barry the night before.<eos> Then I fixed it.
She went straight there.<eos> Thanks, Rache.<eos> 14 Colwell Avenue.<eos> It's on the PNC and our systems, resident known to us as a dealer.<eos> Gill, Carla's gone to a house, some kind of drugs den.<eos> ~ Not Ben's?<eos> ~ Mark Britton is his name.<eos> Known dealer, previous for assault.<eos> Shall we bring him in?<eos> Let's make use of the surveillance while we've got it.
But I do not think that Keri is gonna be the next body that we find.<eos> She just does not fit the profile of the Gig Harbor Killer's victims.<eos> You know, this guy gets off on messing with our minds.<eos> That's why it's been so quiet.<eos> It's not gonna be quiet for long.<eos> Russell.<eos> You've got to hear this.<eos> Please, I can't help you if you don't give me your location.<eos> What is this? 911 call, came in a few minutes ago.<eos> Tracing it now.
Jared was easily manipulated, easily led.<eos> All the way to prison.<eos> Winthrop let his brother take the fall.<eos> But, in doing so, he lost that loving feeling.<eos> Which is why he wants to spring him now.<eos> He wants his old partner back.<eos> But in the meantime, he's a serial killer.<eos> He enjoys killing.<eos> But he needs help.<eos> And we think he found it.
Sounds like a recipe for disaster.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> He wants you to talk some sense into me.<eos> Haven't I told you to stop creeping up on people like that before?<eos> All right, then, Bruce.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> I'm perfectly fine.<eos> Alfred's a worrywart.<eos> What did you do to your hand?<eos> I burned it.
Christa, you're bleeding!<eos> It's not my blood.<eos> It's his!<eos> We're comparing the blood on Christa's dress to the samples in the database.<eos> It's gonna take a while.<eos> I can't believe that someone on this ship attacked a child.<eos> I want Christa to stay in the medical centre for now.<eos> No one gets near her until we find this guy.<eos> Captain, Christa's white blood-cell count is dangerously high.<eos> She needs an inoculation, but she refuses to take it.
I think it's distinguished.<eos> You look like Helen Mirren.<eos> I could see that.<eos> You don't know who Helen Mirren is.<eos> She's the deaf and blind gal from olden days.<eos> That's Helen Keller.<eos> Yeah, she's the one who gave him the haircut.<eos> Anyway, happy birthday, Ronny.<eos> Mmm. Mom, I love this lasagna.<eos> Oh, honey, I love that you love it.
Miaotong, Sir Shen must never find out about you and young Master Yan.<eos> You don't want to displease... an Imperial Assassin.<eos> Yichuan, try it on.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Lian is here.<eos> Lian.<eos> Bottoms up.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> Did you go see Miss Zhou?<eos> Yichuan, that pretty thing you have on your belt, where did you get it?
Confess... and you won't need to suffer anymore.<eos> Finish the last few bottles... and we can go home.<eos> Officer... we have Commanders orders... to keep feeding him this drug.<eos> Take a walk.<eos> - But... You didn't see me.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> Sir Yan, I am Shen Lian... a friend of Miaotong's.<eos> She asked me to get you out of here.<eos> Miaotong...<eos> She wrote you a letter, and asked me to bring it to you.
Are you kidding me?<eos> I can't believe she caved.<eos> It's the right move.<eos> Excuse me. I'm about to place a very important phone call to a misogynist warlord.<eos> So if you two could take this conversation somewhere else, that'd be great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I have General Kolba on video chat.<eos> What, was he out of minutes on his phone?<eos> It was the first thing that worked.<eos> Do you want me to cancel it or...
Thanks a lot<eos> Son, I need to talkto you in private<eos> Shall we go in?<eos> No need alone Whatever it iswe can discuss here<eos> It's very important<eos> He's calling you in, right?<eos> He might show yousome bureau Check if we can line our pocket!<eos> Signal from inside<eos> Owning such a big bungalow,why do you work in a TV channel?<eos> If you rent it for a TV soapyour bank balance will overflow
You're with us all the time Your route is truly unique<eos> All-ways! Check if the wood is strong<eos> Are you intending tomake it into door jambs?<eos> Get in soonClimb up fast<eos> Stop harpinglike a bus conductor<eos> Who is that jumping intothe temple compound?<eos> Come fast Wait, my yellow baghas got caught<eos> Come<eos> It is so ancient<eos> What if someone elsehas stolen it before us?
So did you.<eos> I patched up guys.<eos> I can no more, you know, re-jigger a hard drive...<eos> - Reformat.<eos> - What?<eos> Reformat a hard drive.<eos> You gave what you had to give.<eos> You served.<eos> And you deserve all the help and gratitude that's offered to you.<eos> But if you think that by accepting this help you're taking it away from the next guy, you are wrong.
Working on what?<eos> - Uh, nothing.<eos> N-Never mind.<eos> - N-No.<eos> - That's weird.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> Indeed.<eos> What's he doing now?<eos> Well, it looks like he's trying to repair a cell phone.<eos> He just took the SIM card and put it in a new burner.
So why aren't you in the caravan then?<eos> Well... well... well, squeaky wheel gets the oil.<eos> - Dez. - Yeah.<eos> You smelt the caravan burn.<eos> You didn't see anything cos you were in the shed.<eos> Did you hear anything?<eos> Bang.<eos> You heard a bang.<eos> Cal's got a gun. I've seen it.<eos> - When have you seen it?
- Dez. - Yeah.<eos> You smelt the caravan burn.<eos> You didn't see anything cos you were in the shed.<eos> Did you hear anything?<eos> Bang.<eos> You heard a bang.<eos> Cal's got a gun. I've seen it.<eos> - When have you seen it?<eos> - If he's annoyed at us... he waves it about.<eos> Says he'll bang it.
- It's only fair.<eos> I looked after her.<eos> She wasn't easy.<eos> I looked after your mummy so you wouldn't have to.<eos> No, what you did was you got her to the lowest point she ever got in the life.<eos> She shouldn't have ended up like this.<eos> She could sing.<eos> She could've sung.<eos> What have you ever done?<eos> Inherited a house and drank in it.
We're standing in the middle of the park.<eos> Our killer had to carry her in.<eos> Hey, fan out.<eos> Look for a blood trail.<eos> They won't find one.<eos> All the blood was drained from her body - before it was dumped here. - Uh...<eos> I hate to sound all "Silence of the Lambs," here, but she's got something in her mouth.<eos> Nylon.<eos> In the '60s, there was a serial killer who broke into women's homes.<eos> He strangled them with a stocking, and then he tied it into a bow.
I apologize.<eos> It's a recent development.<eos> Abe sort of absconded with this ledger.<eos> Problem is, the customers are written in some sort of code.<eos> You're saying he stole it?<eos> "Borrowed."<eos> The antique weaponry game is a cutthroat business.<eos> But I'm sure I can crack the code, given enough time.<eos> If Devin Bentley's name is in here, that's all the evidence we need to arrest him.<eos> Yeah, until the court finds out that you obtained this evidence illegally, and they throw it out...
- Have endured for 400 years.<eos> He's perhaps the greatest writer in history.<eos> So, I'd quite like you to explain what gives you,<eos> "Mr. Chris," the authority to rewrite one of the greatest writers that's ever been.<eos> Okay, first of all, I love the guy as much as you do.<eos> It's not like I'm saying I'm a better writer than our boy shakes.<eos> Oh, but you think you should spread that love by teaching impressionable young children that his words are actually irrelevant?<eos> No, it's just that I think that when it comes to shakes...<eos> Will you just let Marcus do the original version of Romeo and Juliet?<eos> He already knows the scene and we've been performing it together since he was in diapers.
Mary Charles, my sister, my idol.<eos> Thank you for mercilessly hacking me in our every game of one-on-one.<eos> I'm the shooter I am now because driving on you paralyzed the young me.<eos> Still does.<eos> Uncle Julius.<eos> Thank you for teaching me the values of uncommon sense.<eos> You know, I'm the one that stopped that abortion, too, that your momma was gonna have.<eos> Reggie Vaughn.<eos> My cousin.<eos> Dude, you took that word cousin and just blew it up to include all these other amazing human words like advocate, cornerman, confidant, loyalist.
You wanna talk about what happened at church?<eos> Look, man, let's leave it at this: brand building got no place in a spiritual conversation, Reg.<eos> Amen.<eos> That preacher was just trying to make a name for himself.<eos> - His church will probably get bigger and bigger, too.<eos> - Haters gonna hate.<eos> People like to join places where hate seems to be endorsed by God.<eos> Makes their hate not their fault.<eos> Walked right into that trap.<eos> Set it up myself.
We're gonna need some more batteries, and I think we're pretty low on fishing line. It worked.<eos> Told you.<eos> Hey, how about a little love for the maestro?<eos> Good work, Jerry.<eos> Thanks, sistah.<eos> I got movement, Jerry.<eos> One diversion, coming right up.<eos> Hey, have you seen my pocket knife?<eos> Did you lose it again?<eos> Maybe one of the kids took it.
I can't believe that Wendy would treat you like... like hired help?<eos> Hmm. Where would she get that idea?<eos> Okay, I know...<eos> I should've corrected her, but I just really, really want Henry and Izzy to be able to go to that school.<eos> I do, too, and that's why I played along, but it's going too far.<eos> You get to hang out with the rich moms, and I get to be the nanny!<eos> Well, if it helps, you're really good at it.<eos> Ai. Pobrecita Wendy.<eos> "Poor Wendy"?<eos> Mama, I don't think you get how sympathy works... Or who deserves it.
I knew you would.<eos> That's why I brought this.<eos> One morning, an envelope was dropped at my office.<eos> Inside was a key to a locker in the Penn Station and a note that read,<eos> "Destroy anything you find."<eos> This box was in the locker.<eos> What's in it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> If I had opened this box, and there was evidence, morally I would have been compelled to share it with the prosecution.<eos> So I didn't open it.

But writing the book of people who are in charge of you. What can I do?<eos> If you want to blame, blame the idiot just your brain.<eos> Chairman, I used to listen to ...<eos> Enough!<eos> Before these problems subside, you'd better do all sorts first.<eos> - This is a receipt.<eos> - Yes.<eos> If you see this child, please contact me.<eos> Trouble you.<eos> If you see it, please contact me.

Hey, Izzy.<eos> That's a pretty cool bag.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'll be the first girl to have it.<eos> Besides Jackie and Becca and Emma.<eos> And Tiffany and Sophie.<eos> But we don't talk to Sophie.<eos> Here's the thing... it starts with that bag, and then you need stuff to put into it, like makeup.<eos> Are we going shopping?<eos> You only want that bag because your friends have it, but then they'll want other new bags.
Nice to meet you.<eos> Come in, he's expecting you.<eos> Come in.<eos> There's an aeroplane landing in one hour.<eos> On it is a man<eos> - Mr Reynolds.<eos> He has a present for me.<eos> I want you to go and pick it up.<eos> The present is in his suitcase.<eos> I want you to collect the suitcase and bring it to this address.
Not at all.<eos> It's just routine.<eos> I panicked.<eos> I've never seen anyone like that before and...<eos> You know, I made the call - this guy needs help and he needs it fast, so I just...<eos> I just took him.<eos> ~ Tell us about the rope that was attached to your car. ~ Rope?<eos> The paramedic, he saw a rope attached to your bumper bar.<eos> Oh, yeah, I was giving one of the other drivers a tow, that was all.<eos> You didn't take it off?
You made it to the finals!<eos> Okay, time to blow this up. After they ask you the first question,<eos> I'm gonna wait for you to say The first sentence of your speech.<eos> Beauty pageants destroy women's sense of self-worth. Right, then I'll start our slide show<eos> Of emaciated models with rotten teeth, And you'll continue your speech About the unrealistic expectations of beauty<eos> Men put on women. - Got it.<eos> Then you'll say, as an out-and-proud lesbian,<eos> You could care less what men think.<eos> Uh, we did not talk about that last part. I know.<eos> Uh, I just added it.
If Wiley's partner tries to get in touch with him, he's going to know that something's wrong.<eos> He's liable to panic and then kill Sophie.<eos> That's why we keep what happened here quiet.<eos> Oh. Thanks, Jerry.<eos> Look, I appreciate your help, but you really didn't have to stick around.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> Research is my super power.<eos> Oh, by the way,<eos> I'm pretty sure I broke Captain America's printer.<eos> Also pretty sure he never used it.
Yeah, well, you got to go to Boston to get it...<eos> I know you can't feel, but you were shot in the chest.<eos> You need to get to a hospital.<eos> Bullet missed my lungs, went through.<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> And you know too much about getting shot.<eos> I got to go.<eos> Slow down, tiger.<eos> Remember that black blob you saw floating out of the police station?<eos> Mara called it aether.
What's wrong with Audrey?<eos> What else did she say, Vickie?<eos> That she needed to make someone with oomph.<eos> Then she told me she really liked me and shot me with a taser.<eos> She's sick.<eos> Just go get yourself checked out.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> I'm going back to work.<eos> My swipe badge that gets me in the morgue...<eos> Audrey took it.
Come in.<eos> (Roger gasps) Where am I?<eos> This music.<eos> The mind-blowing furniture.<eos> The spectacular people who look like they all must have passports.<eos> Bonsoir,mesamis.<eos> Champagne?<eos> Check it out-- two chicks dancing.<eos> ROGER: They're making a statement.<eos> I don't understand it, but I want to so bad!
ROGER: They're making a statement.<eos> I don't understand it, but I want to so bad!<eos> O-M-triple-G!<eos> Is that Liev Schreiber?<eos> ! Yeah, the Tesla's completely reversed my carbon footprint.<eos> Every time I start the car, I'm giving back to the Earth.<eos> That's both environmentally friendly and you're Liev Schreiber!<eos> It's incredible!<eos> As is that scarf.<eos> But tell me, Liev Schreiber, why are you still wearing it inside?
But I don't know what to draw.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Had a dispute with hubby?<eos> It became our routine.<eos> We're arguing every day.<eos> He might not like me around him anymore.<eos> I don't seem to be a big deal in his life.<eos> What's the issue?<eos> He's not buying you a red T-shirt anymore when your nose bleeds?<eos> Right... It was him who bought it.
Put the box down now.<eos> Officer, this is my brother.<eos> It's OK...<eos> It's just a misunderstanding.<eos> Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> Jesse, just gonna have to put the box down, mate, OK?<eos> No!<eos> I don't wanna put my hands on my head!<eos> I know.<eos> OK, they'll stop shouting at you if you put it on the ground.
Just tell them, Ned!<eos> Where's Hani?<eos> Silver ute.<eos> You two need to get the hell outta here.<eos> No, we're not going anywhere.<eos> You've got six, maybe seven minutes tops.<eos> We have to go on the record about this.<eos> We're not going anywhere.<eos> And explain what?<eos> What, your brother stole classified nuclear technology and you just passed it on to the black market?
No, there's no way.<eos> I know it's hard to hear.<eos> We all want to think the best of our fathers.<eos> No, it's not that.<eos> Look, my dad used to gamble.<eos> A lot.<eos> When he was in his 20s, he was a rounder.<eos> That's how he scraped together enough cash to buy this place.<eos> But I know for a fact that he quit playing before I was born.<eos> He might have had that card, but I don't believe he ever used it.
Aloha.<eos> Hmm. Can I help you with anything?<eos> Yeah, my cousin was in here recently.<eos> Uh... big guy, looks like me.<eos> Only not as handsome.<eos> He sold you a copy of Lecanto's Doctrina DE Homine.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Of course.<eos> Wonderful copy, splendid condition.<eos> Yeah, I need it back.
- Is there yellow paint on your back?<eos> - Yellow paint?<eos> How did she know?<eos> Stephie?<eos> Hey, Andrew.<eos> Are you the one responsible for making Zelda second-guess her decision to become a lawyer?<eos> Not directly. Why?<eos> She's just responded to a company-wide e-mail regarding the fracking case, "not my problem, turds."<eos> I have a plan.<eos> What is this song, and why is everyone sharing it with me?
Remember this?<eos> So does Emma.<eos> Emma.<eos> Emma, wait up.<eos> Oh, Emma!<eos> Leo!<eos> Just the people I'm looking for.<eos> [Sighs] First edition of "Mrs. Dalloway."<eos> I thought you would enjoy.<eos> I will enjoy it, but why are you giving it to me?
Ran out of time in the pantry, then I have nothing to work with.<eos> We went in there, I gave my idea, he gave his idea, we grabbed the proteins, and we started from there.<eos> We went back and...<eos> I specifically told you that neither... when they're both lean, they don't go together.<eos> We didn't get enough ingredients to really make anything work.<eos> But you didn't know... have an idea.<eos> You didn't have anything real at the end, what you wanted to do.<eos> You were just grabbing stuff, and you kept telling,<eos> "We'll get it as we go, we'll get it as we go."<eos> So both of you pick up a basket, fill it up, and then bring it back.
Do the honors.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> There's no point in playing the blame game.<eos> I'm not gonna do it.<eos> If I'm gonna blame anybody, it's gonna be myself, because I am responsible for what I do, and it's a cowardly thing, what he did.<eos> I'm just so mad, because I know that this leads to a pressure test, which leads to a greater chance of me going home.<eos> Next up, Francis, Elise.<eos> Francis, describe the dish please.<eos> It is a baked-with-yogurt rack of lamb with a crab risotto and blood orange foam with lemon and mint caviar.<eos> Uh, lamb, yeah, it's nice, but you took that lamb out, the fat was still on there, and then you smeared it with yogurt.
Well, we don't even know if he's being targeted.<eos> Last year, Commander Barnes took part in Operation Lower Merion.<eos> The capture of Benham Parsa.<eos> Month after the raid, the SEALs' identities were accidentally leaked, including Barnes'.<eos> I did an online search, came up with this.<eos> I get the feeling that's not a dating profile.<eos> That was a terrorist Web site.<eos> Commander's on a jihad hit list.<eos> McGee, I want everything on this site.<eos> Who made it, who uploaded the photo.
Watch yourself.<eos> Now, I don't know exactly when you intend to use this mirror, but you should know this.<eos> I won't allow you to hurt those I care about.<eos> And I won't allow you to derail my plans because you've suddenly gotten sentimental.<eos> You only get one warning.<eos> Which is more than you get.<eos> I can't make any promises over who may or who may not survive.<eos> You know, you were wrong before.<eos> That you needed leverage to get what you want?<eos> No, that I didn't have it.
Okay. Spoiled brats, as in "the spoiled brats of Snappamatic."<eos> Feature article from two weeks ago.<eos> It's all about rich kids who post pictures of their extravagant lifestyles on Snappamatic.<eos> That's the key to solving the case.<eos> The killer has given us a pictogram, as I predicted, pointing us to that article.<eos> Yeah, maybe, but what about the third image?<eos> - The collage?<eos> - This is it. This is the photo.<eos> Those are Tatiana Fisher's body parts from this photo that she took with her boyfriend, cam magani.<eos> He posted it on his Snappamatic feed.
I just wanted to say thanks for letting me pitch in.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> We couldn't have done this without you.<eos> Yeah, Oren and Kent are alive because of your help.<eos> Well, it's always good to get a win.<eos> - Well, see ya around.<eos> - See ya around.<eos> See ya.<eos> You know, there used to be some finality to all of this.<eos> You took a photo, dump it in the box, and you never see that face again.
What was that?<eos> Janne?<eos> Are the camera batteries charging?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm going to bed.<eos> Would you mind locking the door?<eos> - Can't you do it yourself?<eos> - No, would you please do it?<eos> Please...<eos> - Fine, I'll lock it.
If Nuño does not compete in that race today for all it will seem as if he is also receiving my punishment and no noble house will accept him.<eos> There will be other events, which he will be able to attend.<eos> I don't want it to seem that he is ashamed of what happened to me.<eos> My shame should not be his.<eos> Nuño must seize this opportunity to come forward.<eos> He will not go, Lucrecia.<eos> - How dare you?<eos> Have you forgotten that you're under my roof?<eos> The key, come on.<eos> I command you to give it to me. - No, I will not.
Well, I swear I heard something.<eos> Maybe it's the sound of existential despair.<eos> I hear that's what hell sounds like.<eos> You know what?<eos> You think we're trapped in your hell?<eos> I have to spend every day on repeat with the person I like least on this earth.<eos> Maybe we're trapped in mine.<eos> So, Stefan, tell us.<eos> This house, very charming.<eos> When'd you get it?
You think we're trapped in your hell?<eos> I have to spend every day on repeat with the person I like least on this earth.<eos> Maybe we're trapped in mine.<eos> So, Stefan, tell us.<eos> This house, very charming.<eos> When'd you get it?<eos> About a month or so ago.<eos> No.<eos> More than that, remember?<eos> We met two months ago, and you already had it.
If the Apophis Strain is out there...<eos> You didn't tell this to the FBI?<eos> Lillian is paid to embargo certain key details from your colleagues if she believes they may be of interest to me.<eos> You sure she can be trusted?<eos> - I could say the same thing about you.<eos> - Ladies, please.<eos> I'm surprised the two of you haven't met at a conference or company retreat.<eos> Does the FBI do a Christmas party?<eos> One of the priests sent to guard the strain got sick.<eos> And to protect it, the dying man swallowed it whole, taking it to his grave.
For fun.<eos> Well, can I least get a name, rank, and serial number...<eos> Who you are, what you are, where you're from?<eos> No?<eos> That's what I figured.<eos> It's okay, though, 'cause your mission's over.<eos> And there's nothing that you can do about that.<eos> Only question now is, how long do you live?<eos> That revenge that Mitchell desires?<eos> The entire Guard shares it...
I could have you...<eos> That won't stick, and you know it.<eos> Hasn't this office been embarrassed enough?<eos> I didn't hear you deny it.<eos> I didn't come here to negotiate.<eos> I came to say good-bye.<eos> Who knows-- could be another 15 years until we see each other again.<eos> Take care, Erin.<eos> The tape.<eos> You haven't seen it, have you?
That blood is on you, too.<eos> You're a brilliant lawyer, Tori, tough as nails.<eos> But isn't there a line somewhere?<eos> The name on Brasha's new passport-- that's all I need.<eos> You know I can't give you that.<eos> No one will know.<eos> I'll know.<eos> And that's the best thing about it.<eos> For once, let's not make this a game.<eos> I want to make you an offer, and I'd like you to take it seriously.
Oh, my God.<eos> She gave him a cookie.<eos> She gave him a cookie he didn't even order.<eos> I didn't order this cookie.<eos> I know.<eos> I just thought maybe you'd like to try it.<eos> It has nuts.<eos> You can eat around the nuts.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Too much work. I don't want it.
Killed by police.<eos> The third, Maddie Thornhill... single mom who opened fire at a bank in Reston.<eos> Reddington has alleged that these crimes weren't random, but orchestrated by spooks the government continues to finance through their black-ops budget.<eos> Look, to be honest, I think this is a big distraction to keep us busy while Reddington spirits away his ex.<eos> Interview the shooters and their families.<eos> Then we'll worry about the wife.<eos> Hey. What would you say if I told you to pull<eos> Frank and Naomi Hyland's phone records for the past five years?<eos> I'd, uh, ask if you had a warrant.<eos> Would you ask me to show it to you?
Okay.<eos> I see white letters on a black screen.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Okay.<eos> Type forward slash b-n.<eos> It's running a dictionary attack.<eos> - Should take a few seconds.<eos> - Got it.<eos> Okay, it's gonna give you a password.<eos> I need you to write it down.
Okay, got them.<eos> Are you call the cops or something?<eos> No.<eos> Now I'm only more interested in your test results.<eos> Please continue.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You okay?<eos> You didn't get the password.<eos> I mean, what do you expect?<eos> 'Course I got it.
You're here to kill me, Duncan.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> "I didn't mean to hurt you." "Whatever."<eos> "Here to talk."<eos> "With Paul?"<eos> "He's a great guy, really."<eos> "I.D.G.A.S."<eos> Why do you think you never met her?<eos> Because she's not real!<eos> The picture she posted, the one that brought you here... I posted it.
But I have run out of ways to get people to pay attention.<eos> Do this, and the world will listen.<eos> They'll examine my life, my research.<eos> That can't happen unless you pull the trigger.<eos> Medic!<eos> I need a medic!<eos> Take it easy, pal.<eos> Creel, listen to me.<eos> You have to understand.<eos> If I have a shot, I'm gonna take it.
Mama happy?<eos> No, honey, Mama's not happy.<eos> Wow!<eos> I knocked the bumper off mine.<eos> But it was worth it!<eos> This is special.<eos> You know how many options this thing has?<eos> Yeah, I'm beginning to get the idea.<eos> Whose is this?<eos> I'm using it for work.
Those three aren't gonna see the light of day before their 18th birthday.<eos> Before you do any of that, just give me a minute.<eos> Patrolman...<eos> You owe me.<eos> I'm letting you guys go.<eos> You are?<eos> When I was your age, me and my buddies, we took an el train for a joyride.<eos> The cop who picked us up, he could have dropped the hammer on us, ruined our lives.<eos> But instead, he let us go.<eos> He said, "everybody gets one break, even if they don't deserve it."
Okay. I'm a ten, you're a four.<eos> This one's our new chocolate white chocolate, and for every dozen we sell, we donate 50 cents to Operation Smile.<eos> Yeah, nobody's listening to you.<eos> They're all watching Sugar write frosting swears on her jugs.<eos> She just wrote "vagina" on her boobs.<eos> That doesn't even make any sense.<eos> She's doing what?<eos> I told her ten minutes ago to put another batch of oatmeal in the oven.<eos> Oh, that dough is gone, Lois.<eos> I warmed it up and put it behind those waist-high holes in the wall.
The plan was to renovate and live happily ever after, but he had an affair with a coed from the nearby university, and when the wife found out, she became consumed with grief and hung herself in the basement.<eos> And the husband?<eos> 3 months later, he killed himself, as well, and it's believed that their spirits haunt the place.<eos> What's the real story, not the urban legend, but the truth?<eos> Is there a police record on any of this?<eos> It was 10 years ago.<eos> The case package is archived.<eos> I requested it, but it'll take a few days.<eos> The property reports shows that the house went into foreclosure in 2003.<eos> The bank put it on the market.
Look. I was in a bad place back then.<eos> I made some stupid choices.<eos> Why does it matter?<eos> Someone killed Andrea's dog.<eos> What?<eos> Can you tell us where you were last night?<eos> I was at home with Kenneth.<eos> Are you accusing me of killing that dog?<eos> It was, like, 15 years old.<eos> It probably died, and Andrea is pretending like somebody killed it.
What?<eos> I... he's okay, but it was just luck.<eos> You're probably the only person who's safe around me right now.<eos> I need you to help before I hurt anybody else.<eos> There's only one way to help with this affliction.<eos> Well, just fine. Do it. You haven't heard what I have to say.<eos> I don't care. My son is in pain because of me. Just fix it.<eos> This...<eos> This is an ancient spell.<eos> It's designed to take away light magic from those who choose to part with it, but the effect would be permanent.
He's upstairs. We've been trying to call you all night.<eos> Well, I'm sorry if I don't respond to your every summons!<eos> Though I did bring that locator potion you wanted.<eos> Maybe next time, try leading with, "thank you."<eos> Now, may I see my son, please?<eos> You might want to finish buttoning your shirt first.<eos> Oh. Well, I was in a rush to get here.<eos> A locator potion.<eos> How does this work, exactly?<eos> We just pour it over anything that belonged to Emma... something... Something like this.
You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything say can and will be used against you you in a court of law...<eos> This is gonna get cleared up, right?<eos> I mean, you guys aren't drug dealers, are you?<eos> Technically, yes.<eos> What do you think made the special brownies special?<eos> Love?<eos> Your mom and I don't view weed as a drug.<eos> I mean, to us, it's medicine.<eos> And we only provide it to those in need.
I found his notepad.<eos> He was thorough.<eos> It's probably the shrink training.<eos> Exactly.<eos> So I'm hoping that he made some notes about serving the warrant, you know?<eos> Maybe even something about Sanderson.<eos> Okay, but these are all covered in blood.<eos> Yeah, that's why I'm using this.<eos> It's blood detergent.<eos> So, it'll solubilize the blood and remove it enzymatically.
You telling me you can sleep well, knowing what you've done?<eos> Yes.<eos> Very well.<eos> When you joined the Bureau, you took an oath to protect and to defend this country.<eos> And that, Agent Booth, is what I have always done.<eos> Damn.<eos> Hoover.<eos> It's really true.<eos> But all his personal records were destroyed when he died.<eos> No way anyone gets their hands on that much information and destroys it.
- when i first started out, It's--everyone, you know,<eos> Is like the post punk days, And everyone was playing Big stacks and marshalls,<eos> And it was like the ramones, And i loved all that,<eos> But i just didn't really feel That that was me.<eos> I didn't want to wear a leather Jacket and be like them,<eos> And i tended to go for something A little bit more folky And pastoral Or whatever, i mean,<eos> As far as guitar playing. - what kind of music Do you consider yourself making?<eos> - rock and roll, I guess.<eos> You know-- - pure rock and roll?<eos> - if you come up with a really Good phrase, we'll use it.
And i'm childish enough to get Really a kick out of this thing, This weird way Of doing this,<eos> And i kind of-- I revel in that. It's the stupidity Of being 17 again.<eos> - it's a pretty weird way To, like--to live, you know?<eos> It's a pretty strange way To enter into adulthood, But it's no less strange Than a lot of other jobs,<eos> I guess. I'd much rather be a rock And roll singer than, like,<eos> A senator, so, yeah.<eos> - i've been a busboy, And i like this better. I mean, What else would i do?<eos> This is fun.<eos> You know, You do it so long, You kind of forget That it's a real job, But this tour Is gonna be a reminder.<eos> - yeah, you know, It was time to do it.
- mike drafted a little press Release before he went<eos> Into the hospital-- "to our fans in prague,<eos> We will be back No matter what." A month a later We tacked on--<eos> We flew in and did a show Just in prague,<eos> Just for the fans there. That's the night that michael Came down with his hernia,<eos> So michael's walking Around prague going,<eos> "you know, I'm not feeling quite right." -i had a hernia Because i sing hard.<eos> The doctor told me I was pushing the--<eos> Pushing from singing is what Caused it to happen.<eos> I've had it For a few years.
Left my last good one in Puerto Rico.<eos> Does the work of a priest.<eos> Turns water holy.<eos> Well, you know, I could probably put it in my carry-on if you need some space.<eos> Well, that would be lovely if you were going with.<eos> But you're still on R and R.<eos> You're that concerned about me?<eos> That's why I'm letting you crash here.<eos> I'll turn the traps on on my way out.<eos> The house will keep you safe as long as you don't leave it.
We need a link to the child's soul.<eos> The placenta.<eos> It's buried in their backyard.<eos> Local tradition.<eos> It's supposed to bring good luck.<eos> Fat lot of good that did.<eos> All right, you stay here.<eos> Watch for trouble.<eos> We've got some digging to do.<eos> If the placenta's really buried in Hugo's back yard, I can find it myself.
- She'll just say talk to my wife.<eos> - Then you should talk to your wife.<eos> - Edwards, you ready? - Uh-huh.<eos> It's invading everything.<eos> I'm literally peeling it off the spleen.<eos> And it's 7.8 pounds. Wow.<eos> 7.8 pounds of lousy parenting.<eos> But she does have a Dutch braid.<eos> It's like a French one, but only harder to do.<eos> I used to do it for my sister when my mom was strung out.
Uncontrollable bleeding.<eos> Acidosis.<eos> Cold.<eos> We all know what the combination means.<eos> We call it the triad of death, the point of no return.
She got me.<eos> You think it's possible that my one true love in my life is a girl?<eos> Did you get excited by her vagina?<eos> No.<eos> Then no.<eos> Good point. ♪ Vagina ♪ - ♪ Va-va-va ♪ - ♪ Vagina ♪<eos> Sing it.<eos> - ♪ Va-va-vagina♪ - ♪ Vagina ♪ - ♪ Vagi-na-ha ♪ - It's a weird word.<eos> I think it sounds pretty.<eos> People should say it more.
Since we had to reattach Lee's sutures in the O.R., it did set us back a few days.<eos> But I assure you, it's a minor complication of the technique.<eos> Nothing about this is minor!<eos> Now it sounds like you've just made him worse!<eos> - Honey, maybe this...<eos> - She hasn't held her son once.<eos> Do you know what that's like for her, for her to stand here and just see him covered in tubes?<eos> Sir, I'm very sorry.<eos> You're the one who should be the one apologizing.<eos> You were supposed to do the surgery, but you just passed it off to him!
Thank you.<eos> And no, I will not hold a press conference.<eos> But the story's out there.<eos> And the usual anti-cop suspects are already making noise.<eos> Ask the mayor's staff to field it.<eos> They won't; you know that.<eos> Ask the manufacturer of the camera to stand up there.<eos> Oh, now you're just being...<eos> Did the camera malfunction?<eos> Did our officer turn it off?
He must've hit his head.<eos> To me, sounds like a clean arrest with an unfortunate outcome.<eos> I didn't mean to hurt him.<eos> He escalated the situation.<eos> I mean, you hit a cop, all bets are off.<eos> Sure would be nice if we had the rest of the incident on video.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I've been wearing that camera for almost three weeks.<eos> I've never had a problem before.<eos> And you didn't turn it off so you could tune up James Prince without an audience?
Janet Walters.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hannah had reached out to her.<eos> The dean asked me to collect physical evidence from the girl's dorm room. Wait.<eos> What evidence?<eos> Hannah still had the skirt she wore that night.<eos> It was torn up pretty good.<eos> Had what looked like bloodstains on it.<eos> Where's that skirt now?<eos> I delivered it to the dean's office.
A lot of people don't trust cops-- it's a fact.<eos> Let them try living without us for a week.<eos> And if wearing a camera proves to be some kind of magic bullet in getting everyone to trust our cops, I'm all for it, but I haven't seen that.<eos> What I do see is an assumption that a cop will turn the camera off if he wants to hide what he's about to do.<eos> An assumption.<eos> Think Taylor turned his camera off to tune that guy up?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> I sure hope not.<eos> But the larger issue here really bothers me.<eos> We are laying down precedent that a cop's word, a man's word, isn't any good unless there is a real-time digital recording to back it up.
Who she had only known for a few hours.<eos> That doesn't excuse what he did.<eos> Not in a million years.<eos> But in the end the only one who can keep you safe is you.<eos> You're not listening.<eos> I'm saying it's over.<eos> The manufacturer found a faulty sensor in Officer Taylor's body camera.<eos> I am listening, but how does that make it over?<eos> The camera malfunctioned.<eos> Taylor didn't turn it off.
What?<eos> Oh. I'm not being nosy.<eos> It's big letters.<eos> I can read it from here.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hey. Let's step back.<eos> I didn't know Nina Preston was such a big deal.<eos> Never seen her show. What's it called... "Savage Shore"?<eos> I haven't seen it either, but it's a big hit.
You be careful.<eos> Malama aku no.<eos> Go show 'em how it's done!<eos> Alert's out on Vanessa Hansen.<eos> HPD's sitting on her house now.<eos> Believe me, she knows we're onto her.<eos> So I doubt she's going home.<eos> Now, where are we with Wagner's thumbprint?<eos> Well, I spoke to one of the partners at his firm.<eos> He uses it as a biometric key.
What'd it say?<eos> Did it mention the money?<eos> No, he didn't mention the money.<eos> He just wrote "Wish you were here."<eos> It's a picture of this remote area on Oahu.<eos> "Wish you were here" with a rock formation and a couple of... couple of palm trees.<eos> Hold on.<eos> I'm gonna take a picture.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Did you get it?
You're a demon.<eos> Don't be such a racist.<eos> I think all our demons have been great.<eos> Come on, Sam!<eos> I'm awesome!<eos> But if I had to pick a favorite, I would go with the yellow-eyed demon.<eos> That dear old mom of yours, that adorable little sister...<eos> At one point, he says...<eos> I'll make certain that they both live long enough to know the chewy taste of their own intestines.<eos> And he nails the line! He just sticks it!
Save it. You want my silence?<eos> Tell me about Whitney.<eos> What happened between you two?<eos> Look, she came on to me, started flirting, getting all handsy.<eos> A bunch of the boys saw us and figured we hooked up, but we didn't...<eos> I swear it.<eos> In fact, I think she was just after my ranch key.<eos> Ranch key?<eos> It's on a snake key chain.<eos> I think she picked it off me when she was pawing at me.
But during their journey, they stopped, and they tied poor black fox to a tree just south of the river, and they rode off in their gold-laden wagon.<eos> But when they returned... it was empty.<eos> The Peacock brothers stashed the gold.<eos> That's what everybody thought.<eos> When this story surfaced, treasure hunters... they came a-coming.<eos> - Anybody ever find it?<eos> - Nope.<eos> And that's why this is just another legend of the old west.<eos> Whitney was after the gold.<eos> What if, when those missionaries wrote down black fox's story, they wrote it down incorrectly?
Hi!<eos> I am so sorry that I'm late.<eos> Judge: Dr. Alver,<eos> I presume?<eos> Latin lover narrator: You're probably wondering where Luisa has been.<eos> Until a week ago, Luisa was drinking tequila, kissing strange women, and dancing naked.<eos> I was lost, but, your honor, I stand before you here today, ready to accept any punt that you deem necessary.<eos> Judge: This isn't a sentencing.<eos> You just have to answer the petition. Oh.<eos> Well, then I answer it.
Thank you.<eos> Cheers. (Chuckles) Oh.<eos> What's he doing? Well, considering he's at the front desk getting a key... _ - I'm gonna go with checking in.<eos> - Thanks, wiseass.<eos> Makes sense that he's here;<eos> this is the hub of the Sin Rostro operation.<eos> Did you get the picture?<eos> Yep.<eos> Great.<eos> I'll get it to my friend at the FBI to run face recognition.
They sent me back with medication.<eos> A vaccine?<eos> No, it suppresses the symptoms. And delays the progress of the virus. Okay.<eos> At least it's something.<eos> The thing is it's difficult to make.<eos> And there's a limited supply.<eos> How much did they give you?<eos> Not enough.<eos> Each dose lasts 12 hours.<eos> I want you to have it, To be in charge of distributing it.
They're forgers, every last one of them.<eos> So, the government did this?<eos> The government, Soviet super-spies, aliens.<eos> There's a sweet old lady in Tulsa who thinks that Elvis did it.<eos> All I know is that it wasn't me.<eos> And with your help, I can prove it.<eos> How?<eos> The bullet.<eos> It's still in Cooper's head.<eos> We asked for it during the trial so they could see that it did not come from my gun.
I'm supposed to deed over my interest to David Lee.<eos> But...<eos> I'm not going to.<eos> Someone's turned on.<eos> You're bad.<eos> How am I bad?<eos> J-Serve.<eos> What is that?<eos> You spend the night, and then, the next day, the Feds sweep in with an indictment for J-Serve.<eos> Are you suggesting I got it from you?
We even know which one.<eos> I bet that you used framer's glue to attach those crystals.<eos> You showed David this piece, he refused to take it, you lost your temper, and you took a swing.<eos> No, you can't prove that.<eos> Oh, but we will, when we confirm your fingerprints on the murder weapon.<eos> I... I made that piece, all right?<eos> Of course it has my fingerprints on it.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> So, this is your blood?<eos> So when we test it, it's not gonna come up as David's blood.
It's fine, Winston.<eos> We can fix this.<eos> Just help me mule this crank.<eos> I'll prepare, you mule.<eos> I can't mule crank.<eos> I don't have the system.<eos> It's the perfect plan.<eos> I don't think it is.<eos> Jess, do you know how much time we could get for possessing this much meth?<eos> Why'd you hide it from me?
Man, that is way too soon.<eos> - Warm-warm, warm-cold...<eos> - You got this, don't get flustered!<eos> Cold-cold, hot-cold, hot-hot?<eos> It's hot-hot!<eos> - It's always warm-cold.<eos> - Well, what's "permanent press"?<eos> - Fake button, nobody uses it.<eos> - Yeah, don't press that one.<eos> The machine is buzzing, you didn't close it!
Now, what is the freakin' problem?<eos> Coach did the opposite of what I asked.<eos> Come on, Jess, you guys would be great together.<eos> It's a dumb rule, all right? Dumb rule.<eos> At least he turns you on.<eos> Pepper makes my ding-dong and my ping-pongs go into my body.<eos> Can somebody help me with this keg?<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> - Pepper's got it.<eos> What if she doesn't know her own strength down there, and she mushes it, or,
I had the stomach for a lot of things.<eos> But not for that.<eos> Do you know how to get ahold of this Shostak guy?<eos> He has a messaging service.<eos> Whether or not he calls me back...<eos> Give it a go.<eos> If he calls me back I say what?<eos> You have Halstead, and you want to make a deal.<eos> And tell him you got a photo of Halstead, dead.<eos> We'll rig it.
Homey.<eos> Anything but.<eos> Dominic will have his men going floor by floor.<eos> We can't stay hidden forever.<eos> And we can't blast out way out of here.<eos> We're gonna need an escape route.<eos> Elias, I could use your help here.<eos> They shot Anthony.<eos> Dominic wanted my attention.<eos> Well, now he has it.
Eh, if you're gonna arrest me, arrest me.<eos> So you can sit silent in a cell with an expensive attorney?<eos> Mm, I'd rather leave you out there, let the world know we're looking for you.<eos> Once news of this hits the streets, Berlin will know the U.S. government is spending limitless resources and time looking for you... a man who has intimate details about him and his business affairs.<eos> You have two options...<eos> either you lead me to Berlin... or I lead Berlin to you.<eos> How exactly did you come upon this information?<eos> A C.I., someone the Bureau trusts.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> If the Bureau had a lead, they'd follow it.
Just to find a reason to turn on us.<eos> Shouldn't fear me.<eos> I'm just one man.<eos> And the glorified bus driver as backup.<eos> One man that was a Spartan.<eos> You're playing scared, Commander.<eos> See, I already died.<eos> That's the difference between you and me.<eos> Gave my life away when I was signed up to be a soldier.<eos> It's a matter of what I will give it away for now.
Did we have a name?<eos> - Fanny Magnet.<eos> - That's right.<eos> Fanny Magnet. Anyway, I've written a new song.<eos> I want to do it at the open mic at the White Horse.<eos> - What's the song called?<eos> - New Age Girl. - Is it about Maggie? - No.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm up for it, if it's any good.<eos> Well, come around to mine Tuesday night before we head off to the club and I'll play it for you.
Can't remember.<eos> He says he wants us to do one of his songs at the White Horse next Thursday.<eos> Can you come?<eos> - No. It's a school night, I have marking to do.<eos> - Oh, bugger.<eos> What's brought this on, then?<eos> Is he having a crisis? I think he's trying to impress Maggie.<eos> Oh, dear. He really needs to move on.<eos> - What's the song like?<eos> - Haven't heard it yet.
In a historical context, yeah, it's fine.<eos> I could do some reading at uni, if you like, see what I can find out.<eos> Yeah, cool.<eos> Lance won't mind, will he?<eos> No. Why would he?<eos> Well, I think he thinks I'm muscling in.<eos> No, he's just very protective of his patch and his hobby, and he's got a big problem with the Antiquisearchers.<eos> The Antiquisearchers?<eos> I know, right? What does that even mean?<eos> They've just taken the first half of antiquities and put it on the front of searchers.
If you like.<eos> And loser leaves the club.<eos> ~ All right, tosser.<eos> ~ You tosser. ~ Are you?<eos> ~ No, you are.<eos> 'Right, now, quiz rules state...'<eos> ~ Come on, then, that's us.<eos> ~ '.. that everyone must hand over 'their telephones for the duration of the quiz.'<eos> So, how does this work?<eos> Quiz master asks the questions and if you know the answer you write it down.
Still sound like a dickhead.<eos> Look like a dickhead as well.<eos> ~ Immature as usual. ~ Dickhead.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Too late, mate.<eos> They're pushing us out.<eos> ~ They've got sole permission.<eos> ~ Did you take this photo? No.<eos> ~ Well, you haven't even seen it yet so obviously you did. ~ What is it?
Not like Tonto.<eos> ~ Terry, you're back!<eos> ~ Can't keep a good man down, Russell.<eos> ~ How's the leg?<eos> ~ Oh, a bit stiff, but on the mend.<eos> The doctors said he will back at Flamenco in a month.<eos> Well, we'll see, love.<eos> Don't want to rush things.<eos> Hang on, where's the finds table?<eos> ~ We couldn't find it.
Worst party ever, by the way.<eos> Uh, worse than being at a dance club That has a price club?<eos> Max Black in the house of grain.<eos> And now he saw me.<eos> Well, I'm gonna go hide before she sees me.<eos> I'll be in Tom's Shoes.<eos> Nobody's ever over there.<eos> I'm bustin' out some free range electronic dance music.<eos> That's right!<eos> I'm bringing it in my own bag.
Well, I don't know.<eos> That... that guy and his daughter are always doing stuff together.<eos> Did you ever wish I was, you know, more like him?<eos> Wha... dad, no.<eos> Why would you even say that?<eos> You're amazing.<eos> My whole life, you made sure my bike tires were pumped up.<eos> You let me ride on your shoulders when I cleaned out the gutter.<eos> Whenever mom yells, "I just can't do it anymore," you make my lunch for a few days.<eos> And best of all, when you find a pretty rock at the quarry, you always bring it home for me.
Nah, I was at work until midnight.<eos> You can ask my employees.<eos> Yeah, they'll alibi for you.<eos> You're their boss.<eos> Yeah, and of course you're gonna try to railroad somebody 'cause you're the cop's brother.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I heard her call you Reagan.<eos> Same name that's on that card.<eos> So, you admit you saw it.<eos> Yeah, Tina showed it to me. So what?
I'll meet you there.<eos> No. No, no, no.<eos> He won't go there.<eos> It's got to be somewhere private.<eos> He's got a, a garage on Ninth Street, all right?<eos> Go there now.<eos> Shut up already.<eos> That feel good?<eos> Hey, I'm almost there.<eos> Get that door open-- the minute I pull inside, you shut it behind me.
Chief Hale.<eos> - My name is Christopher...<eos> - Herrmann.<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> - Listen, hey!<eos> All right, listen, I get it.<eos> All right?<eos> You got a beef with me.<eos> Sandbag my career, fine.<eos> But don't take it out on Molly's II.
I'm cutting carbs.<eos> So, did you, uh, get a chance to look over that offer?<eos> Yeah, it's great.<eos> I can finally move into a better place, maybe get that colonoscopy my doctor's been pushing for.<eos> What if I told you there's an even better offer coming?<eos> There is?<eos> There sure might be!<eos> Tomorrow, someone could show up and offer way more.<eos> But, Phil, this is above asking.<eos> Why don't you want me to take it?
I prefer the term "creative realist."<eos> Well, not many realists I know believe that the government is developing time travel technology in Area 51.<eos> Yeah, not many skeptics I know have read the redacted files that I have, so...<eos> There is a reason you called?<eos> Yes.<eos> The substance found on Wilson's wrist was, in fact, tobacco resin.<eos> I isolated the cotinine properties and found that this particular type, the Roman Shisha, is somewhat rare.<eos> It's also only used for hookah smoking.<eos> It's only sold in a few local spots.<eos> And the resin can be wiped out quite easily, but it was still on Commander Wilson, which means he likely encountered it within hours of his death.
You hungry?<eos> Yeah, I don't think I've eaten in days.<eos> We got... peanut butter, rice, baked beans and a can of salsa.<eos> You can make a meal out of that?<eos> You don't know who you're talking to.<eos> Thanks, Brody.<eos> The intelligence specialists-- they took my potato salad, didn't even ask.<eos> Come on.<eos> Well, you don't eat potato salad,<eos> I didn't eat it, and King ain't here.
That is a career you're messing with, and why?<eos> Because you can't stand anyone but you soaking up my attention.<eos> You are not the sun, Eliza.<eos> The world does not revolve around you.<eos> You're right.<eos> [Chuckles] I think I'm the sun.<eos> And I hear from your tone that I'm not.<eos> Point bees, until we figure out who the sun is, maybe we need to go back to meeting like one to three times per week.<eos> You do need help.<eos> But you're not gonna get it from me.
I know. But she's okay. She has to be.<eos> And I don't care how old she is.<eos> She can save us.<eos> Okay, then. We're relying on mirror dust and fairies, but now we have a plan, which is progress.<eos> Let's go find your sister,.<eos> Holy cats! That is cold.<eos> Ice is like that, I've noticed.<eos> The urn.<eos> It was here. It's gone, and so is Elsa and my aunt!<eos> But I saw you with it.
Delicious homemade bread?<eos> That looks like just regular white bread.<eos> You two seem drunk.<eos> This will soak up the booze.<eos> Am I...?<eos> Alex.<eos> Wait.<eos> Lily.<eos> Alex brought your backpack in for you.<eos> So why don't you go ahead and take it out to our car?
So why don't you go ahead and take it out to our car?<eos> Maybe later.<eos> No, Lily! Um, it's okay.<eos> I will take it now.<eos> Alex, put the backpack down!<eos> Mom!<eos> Lily, you are not in charge of what you wear, of breakfast, or anything.<eos> Now, put that backpack on and march it out to the car!<eos> It's too heavy.<eos> Well, that's tough because I'm not carrying it for you anymore!
My father brought it all back with him from Vietnam.<eos> Army?<eos> Dad?<eos> No, marines.<eos> Army.<eos> '67 and '68.<eos> Airborne.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, then, you can probably see that the Buddha statue is the real deal.<eos> My dad said he got it from a monk in the jungle.
Now, when the starting quarterback gets hurt and the coach has to put in the backup QB, that's just the way it is.<eos> There's no time for bruised egos, Cruz.<eos> We're all one team, man.<eos> I say this as a friend.<eos> The engine needs to be running in order to get an accurate level on the transmission fluid.<eos> Incredible, she did it again.<eos> She left the flipping compartment door open.<eos> So say something then.<eos> What's the point?<eos> Casey's just gonna tell me to close it.
is the one that's between measures "B" and "D"<eos> She's been working really hard on her alphabet.<eos> She used to have to sing that.<eos> Measure "C" is the proposal to shut down Taft high school, right?<eos> Right, right.<eos> Taft is largely African-American?<eos> Yeah, and Latino.<eos> There's a whole lot of "Julios" down by that schoolyard.<eos> Taft is a failing school.<eos> If the school board shuts it down, we can send the kids to some of the more successful schools in the district, like Woodbridge.
- You must not delay. hasten, go!<eos> - aren't you coming?<eos> - I must stay!<eos> - Stay!<eos> - Go quickly!<eos> - No!<eos> - Woe if you wait!<eos> - No!<eos> - Your life...<eos> - I care nothing for it.
Where are we?<eos> Well... chloral hydrate is not a recreational drug.<eos> Fisher wouldn't have taken it voluntarily.<eos> So somebody drugged him.<eos> Doc didn't find any injection marks on Fisher's body, but there were remnants of paper cups in the fire pit.<eos> The drug could've been put into his drink.<eos> Why would somebody incapacitate the husband if they were already planning on shooting him?<eos> Maybe to get the gun?<eos> I mean, if the plan was to murder the family and frame the father, the killer would have had to use his gun.<eos> Fisher would not have handed it over willingly.
I've deejayed for them.<eos> You're not starving people.<eos> I'm out of here.<eos> Peter, I will forgive you later.<eos> Rod, I will never forgive you, and if you ever want to see these Green Bay Packer tickets, read the suicide note.<eos> Then we'll talk. Uh...<eos> I can't read this note, so you're gonna have to read it, get the tickets and then you can take me to the game.<eos> They're my tickets.<eos> You have to read it.<eos> Okay, maybe I will read it and maybe I'll take Kevin.
! Okay, I'm feeling a little bit of judgment.<eos> I heard you talk about all your stupid clothes and your loft and that idiotic cat?<eos> No, you can't...<eos> No. It goes there.<eos> You're a whiny, superficial, petty little man!<eos> I feel very judged here!<eos> You are being judged!<eos> This suicide note is so dense.<eos> Boarding School Thomas is the same as Semester At Sea Thomas, right?<eos> You know, I know everything that's in that note and I didn't even have to read it.
I'm gonna get a drink.<eos> Anyone want a drink?<eos> Honestly, I-I couldn't.<eos> Okay.<eos> God, that son of a bitch.<eos> I caught him looking at my scout team without his glasses.<eos> Oh. Yeah, yeah, I'm pulling a guilt con on Andre.<eos> Just gonna play up the honesty theme.<eos> Honesty, okay, let me try it.<eos> Uh, Kevin, "You're a really good brother," is a phrase that's been a lie every time I've said it.
What is going on down there?<eos> Yeah, right?<eos> I was teaching my self-defense class and one of those girls, she really caught me with a shiv. Right at the base, too.<eos> And I was real hard. You know how much blood's in your dick when you're real hard?<eos> So all that just came pouring right out.<eos> Ugh...<eos> But I think I got it settled down now.<eos> How?<eos> I opened up your mayo, ga<eos> And mayonnaise has healing properties, the Indians used it.
I'll let their eminent advocates fill you in.<eos> Narcisse.<eos> Who is this?<eos> This stable boy's name is Marc d'Linde.<eos> As he would tell you himself, if he could still speak.<eos> Or walk.<eos> - Or move.<eos> - And you think Condé's nephew<eos> - Emile did this?<eos> - Witnesses say Marc was leaving a Catholic mass when Emile took a rock and threw it with all his strength.
People just give us their best food and wine, and ask nothing in return.<eos> I love being a queen.<eos> What are you telling these people?<eos> It's all right, they're like us.<eos> And I promised that we would take them to Amiens.<eos> Would you mind waiting outside?<eos> I would like to have a word with my queen.<eos> Keep them from leaving.<eos> Let us pass.<eos> This music's charming, but it would be much more charming if you were dancing to it.
Since the dawn of time, there has been one truth about men... if they can toss it, pass it, dribble it, or throw it, they will.<eos> - Heads up.<eos> - I'm open.<eos> Frankie: Knock it off, guys.<eos> Stop throwing things in the house.<eos> Why'd you buy fruit if you don't want us to throw it?

Plug me back in!<eos> Look, I came to you because, of all the family, you're the most evil and conniving.<eos> Ooh! Flattery!<eos> I'll give you 20 extra seconds.<eos> Wait. Why were you even near dad's lawn mower?<eos> [Sighs] I was gonna impress Cindy by driving it past her house.<eos> Pbht. Okay.<eos> There's a lot of issues to deal with in that statement, but first let's deal with the lawn mower, then we'll circle back to your lack of game.<eos> Go on.<eos> Well, the lawn mower wouldn't start, so I opened the lid thing, smacked it with my fist like dad does, but when I did, I smacked the key out of my hand and down into the engine.
Dad's gonna kill me.<eos> He's already mad about the sink.<eos> Add wrecking his lawn mower to the mix, and who knows what he's gonna do?<eos> Ooh. Hang on.<eos> Hang on.<eos> I think I can help you.<eos> I was saving this one for myself in case I ever got in trouble, but, uh, I'm crazy responsible now, so I'll never need it.<eos> Here's what you're gonna do.<eos> You take dad's wallet.<eos> He'll go nuts looking for it, think somebody stole it.
[Chuckling] Oh, you got me.<eos> Place looks amazing, doesn't it?<eos> It's really coming together.<eos> Damn it.<eos> All my credit cards are in there, my license.<eos> I've had that wallet since I was a kid.<eos> I love that wallet.<eos> It's one of the only things I care about.<eos> Oh... I said "one of the only."<eos> Well, where did you have it last?

I'm just trying to help.<eos> Well, you're not helping.<eos> This is nuts.<eos> I don't lose stuff.<eos> You're the one who loses stuff.<eos> Hey, I don't lose things any more than anybody else.<eos> Really?<eos> Where's the blue bag, Frankie?<eos> It's not lost.<eos> We had it when we were at Disney World.
One week to the final, ladies.<eos> You got to make it through your entire routine, or you fail.<eos> A snapped ankle is no excuse.<eos> You can't tank tinikling, not on tink's time.<eos> Heck, get in there!<eos> "Wow" us! [Clapping continues] Ugh!<eos> Slight snag with the plan.<eos> I seem to have misplaced dad's wallet.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Well, I hid it between the pages of "A Tale of Two Cities," but that was too obvious, so I moved it somewhere.
- Uh-oh. - [Singsong voice] Show time.<eos> You're on.<eos> Now, uh, remember... whatever happens in there, you and me... Do not know each other.<eos> Brick, you want to explain what this was doing in my lawn mower and why it's not working now?<eos> Looks like somebody who was told not to touch it...<eos> I found your wallet.<eos> - What?<eos> You're kidding? - Hey!<eos> I've been looking everywhere for this.<eos> Where'd you find it?
Can you imagine if he gets to decide if I get aunt opal's purple cow creamer that you already promised me?<eos> Sue, that thing broke years ago.<eos> You say it broke, but did you see it break?<eos> Or is Axl looting from the estate already?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> What matters is I found dad's wallet.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I see what you're doing.<eos> You're trying to get on dad's good side so you'll get more of the inheritance.<eos> Well, maybe he'd be interested to know he didn't lose his wallet 'cause you took it in the first place!
Erm, the garage didn't sell much except chocolate and porn, and I didn't buy any porn, obviously.<eos> Nobody pays for porn any more.<eos> It's all online, millions and millions of pages of the stuff.<eos> Snickers or Twix?<eos> - Can I have a Twix after you've opened that door again?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Right.<eos> Whoa, this is really badly designed.<eos> Uhhh, I'm really not good with heights.<eos> - Why aren't you opening it again?
Look.<eos> Color is consistent with Reed's uniform.<eos> I think we found our point of entry.<eos> Well, if we did, we didn't just stumble upon it.<eos> You don't just dump a body here by chance.<eos> Whoever did this knows the area.<eos> I wonder who owns the property.<eos> Let's find out.<eos> Here's the information on that property.<eos> Oliver financed it through the trust, purchased a year ago, recently rented to the moonshiner.
Hello?<eos> 'Hello.<eos> Am I speaking to Mrs Bourne? '<eos> Yes, that's me.<eos> Sorry, little bit out of breath.<eos> 'That's OK.<eos> I'm calling from your car insurance company.<eos> 'Our system says that your policy is up for renewal.'<eos> Oh, no, I think you must have a mistake on your system there.<eos> Because I actually cancelled it about, oh, about eight or nine months ago now.
You know what?<eos> That is annoying.<eos> It's knocked the price down a bit, but still.<eos> Now, just er, put it in there now.<eos> ~ Drop the gun!<eos> ~ Yes, Phil!<eos> Ha, you forgot I had this, didn't you?<eos> It isn't loaded.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Who gave it to you?
Cardiothoracic. But retired.<eos> No shop talk, dear.<eos> The only talk I want is to hear the story.<eos> What story?<eos> The proposal, of course. LANIE:<eos> Oh! That story!<eos> Right. (LAUGHS) Javi?<eos> Yes, the story. Um...<eos> Well, we, um...<eos> You know, baby, you tell it so much better than me.
Of course you would.<eos> But didn't you say you had a lead?<eos> Yeah. The lab was able to identify the crystals that Lanie found on Eric's sleeves.<eos> They're made up of sodium ferrocyanide mixed with sodium chloride, which means...<eos> It's road salt.<eos> It hasn't snowed in weeks.<eos> So why would Eric be literally up to his elbows in salt?<eos> I don't know, but there are only four salt depots on the island, and one of 'em happens to be within three blocks of our crime scene.<eos> The blue backpack.<eos> We searched for it, we never found it.
Excuse me.<eos> Are we in the spirit world right now?<eos> No.<eos> Is the spirit world in the ground below us?<eos> No, can I just get through my cards?<eos> Oh, honey, don't get flustered.<eos> I'm not!<eos> Uh, why is that vine coming toward us?<eos> Uh, I don't see anything about that on the cards.<eos> I'm gonna poke it with a stick.
Good!<eos> You're all here.<eos> What's with you interrupting my important meetings all the time?<eos> Su! What are you... you're okay!<eos> I'm so sorry about Zaofu.<eos> How did you escape? Opal, Beifong, and I rescued everyone but we had a run in with Kuvira.<eos> We saw her super spirit weapon up close.<eos> Like, really close.<eos> Way too close.<eos> Is she going to use it against Republic City?
I had to do something.<eos> I think I get it now.<eos> You don't understand anything about me.<eos> I do.<eos> Su told me how she took you in when you were younger.<eos> It must have been so hard being an orphan.<eos> Don't pretend you know what it felt like.<eos> The Avatar is adored by millions!<eos> I was cast aside by my own parents, like I meant nothing to them!<eos> How could I just stand by and watch the same thing happen to my nation when it needed someone to guide it?
You ask me every time you throw my trust issues in my face.<eos> You did it this morning and you did it 20 years ago.<eos> I sat 10 years in jail alone.<eos> What were you proving then?<eos> Or did you not know that I was innocent?<eos> Of course I knew.<eos> Then where the hell were you?<eos> September 1st, 1993.<eos> That date is etched in my memory.<eos> I said it over and over, even after it passed and you were in prison.

Do you remember?<eos> Yes.<eos> I never forgot it.

No.<eos> You have to trust me.<eos> I know you have a hard time with that.<eos> - David!<eos> - No, that's why I want you to keep the safe.<eos> Choose the passcode and hide it somewhere.<eos> No.<eos> If this is going to work, we have to trust each other.<eos> I'll choose the code, and you hide the safe.<eos> And when the time's right, we'll open it together and only together.
Good lawyer can do three things at once.<eos> Can you let in Detective McBride, please?<eos> Detective?<eos> You got anything?<eos> Just a voucher for the gun.<eos> Stamped at 13:43 the day before the trial when Hardy retrieved it from the property clerk.<eos> He's pictured with his I.D.<eos> Well, that's what he told me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, either someone got to Hardy and he switched out the guns before he gave it to me, or someone from this office went into the safe after I locked it in there and switched out those guns.
You swiped in twice.<eos> Twice?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, I was in there once.<eos> You're sure?<eos> Yeah, I'm sure.<eos> I went in there for the evidence bags-- three of them, including the gun.<eos> Then that means somebody took your card.<eos> Where do you keep it?
Twice?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, I was in there once.<eos> You're sure?<eos> Yeah, I'm sure.<eos> I went in there for the evidence bags-- three of them, including the gun.<eos> Then that means somebody took your card.<eos> Where do you keep it?<eos> I usually keep it in my bag or on my desk.
Danny?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, Linda.<eos> It's not loaded.<eos> It's, it's...<eos> Yeah, I stood there talking to this nurse, and... she's blonde, about your height, pretty-- not as pretty as you but pretty.<eos> The whole time I was talking to her, I just kept thinking,<eos> Linda got a gun.<eos> You're making this up.<eos> I swear to you I'm not.<eos> I don't want it.
Nothing good.<eos> Come on.<eos> Not unless we have to.<eos> Over here.<eos> Tseebo.<eos> - What?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> He's not the one.<eos> The Imperial HoloNet broadcast should play here at all times!<eos> No one's requested it for, well, ever.
Should you decide to come to our wedding. Dude, that would be amazing.<eos> Money is a little tight right now, 'cause I mostly get paid<eos> In drink tickets.<eos> Did you think That we wouldn't pay for you to come to our wedding?<eos> Because we've been planning on it.<eos> Since we want you to be our best man.<eos> - Wait, what?<eos> - I would be so honored.<eos> Oh, scoob, sorry we can't put you in our wedding party,<eos> Because we want you to officiate it!
I was just using my acting.<eos> And it was good for a while.<eos> Someone should probably go talk...<eos> I... I should probably go talk to her.<eos> Okay.<eos> So I don't know what just happened, but what I do know Is that my behavior has been Michael Lohan-level unfatherly.<eos> And I have been dance moms-level daughter bad.<eos> And I know that was confusing.<eos> Not to me it wasn't.<eos> Look, I've just been planning my wedding Since I was a little girl, and I guess I always imagined You guys planning it with me, not planning your own.
Where do we see our company in the next 5 years?<eos> In the next 10 years?<eos> This now represents just the first phase of what these movies can become.<eos> 1939.<eos> America has nearly recovered from the great depression only to find itself on the cusp of another historical hardship ...<eos> World War II.<eos> At a time when newspapers had little good news to report, readers turned to the back pages for escape.<eos> The daily comic strips were, at once, uplifting and reflective of the true american spirit.<eos> Our story begins in New York City.<eos> Martin Goodman was the original founder of Marvel Comics, which when he started it, was called Timely Comics.
Come on, come on.<eos> Hurry. Come on.<eos> Guys, I don't think we should do this.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> We're going to get in trouble.<eos> Mia, tell your sister not to be so scared.<eos> You said I could have the camera.<eos> I'll give it to you in a minute. Go.
Well, I think that the fairest thing to do is to sell the house.<eos> It's a good market.<eos> We'll make a profit.<eos> We can split it, 50/50.<eos> Joel?<eos> Joel?<eos> She can have it.<eos> It's our kids' home.<eos> It's your home.<eos> I want you to have it.
I get the gist of it.<eos> Ruby, come on, sweetie.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - We've all been there, right?<eos> - Okay. - Yeah, yeah.<eos> - So... are you... are you watching fast times at Ridgemont high?<eos> Yes. It's the TV version, so most of it's cut out.<eos> You're okay with that, Hank, with our 15-year-old daughter watching a film... Oh, he was... that glorifies sexual promiscuity?<eos> Ah, that doesn't...<eos> well, Sarah was watching it, so with her...

- The smart thing to do is just take the emotion out of it and split the asset.<eos> It's not an asset, though, Julia.<eos> - It's an asset.<eos> - It's a home.<eos> In a divorce, everything's an asset.<eos> I refuse to talk about it like that.<eos> We should just be reasonable.<eos> We brought our baby girl home to that house, Julia.<eos> It's the first safe place our son ever spent the night.<eos> I mean, heck... the first night we owned it, you know, we didn't have furniture, even electricity.
I mean, heck... the first night we owned it, you know, we didn't have furniture, even electricity.<eos> But we just laid on that floor, and we talked about the future and argued about what color we were gonna paint the walls.<eos> It's not an asset.<eos> It's a home.<eos> And it kills me to walk away from it, but...<eos> I hurt you.<eos> I hurt you, and I own that.<eos> I get that.<eos> So I don't want the house.<eos> If I can't have you in it, I don't want it.
So where are we gonna hide?<eos> Come on, think about it.<eos> You need a place where you're safe and you can come up with a plan.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Ok.<eos> Look, I have a buddy who has a cabin in the mountains not far from Park City.<eos> Your buddy has a cabin?<eos> His parents do.<eos> It's like a vacation house.<eos> They only use it a few times out of the year.
So, when are you going to introduce yourself?<eos> Ah, I don't know, Aaron.<eos> I'm not gonna plan, I'm just gonna go with the flow and see what opportunities arise.<eos> And I suggest you do the same.<eos> I'm here, aren't I?<eos> Yes.<eos> That's a great start.<eos> Hello.<eos> Um, thanks for the bottle of champagne.<eos> Bartender told me you sent it.
We need to see if Hanna's prints are at the crime scene.<eos> I'm pushing the lab for the results.<eos> Good.<eos> Why don't you go ahead and leave it in park?<eos> This is Agent Callen, Sam Hanna's partner.<eos> You must be Assistant U.S. Attorney Sullivan.<eos> Get out of the car.<eos> Tell me everything you have on Hanna.<eos> Do not make me pull out my gun.<eos> Well, if you did that, I'd just take it from you.
Sounds like your chili.<eos> Where would somebody get their hands on this?<eos> That's the easy part.<eos> It occurs in nature. It comes from the aconitum plant, also known as monkshood or wolfsbane.<eos> Actually, in "ye olden days"" they used the poison to kill wolves, which is why everyone knows that wolfsbane is an effective deterrent against werewolves.<eos> Deeks.<eos> Hmm? What?<eos> Whoa, what the what?<eos> What is that doing on your desk?<eos> I thought you put it there.

It's our new challenge coin.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What a wonderful gift.<eos> Not the warmest reception.<eos> Doesn't mean he doesn't care.<eos> Let's check in with Nell.<eos> Where do we stand, Nell? Hey.<eos> So those rose petals you found reminded me of a case I consulted on at Pendleton.<eos> There was a perfume bottle left at the scene of a crime but no prints.<eos> That got me thinking-- someone had to have left it there on purpose, right?
It's gonna be all right. Remember, I'm the savior.<eos> - Is that like, a real job here?<eos> - Apparently, it is.<eos> I promised all these people I'd get them their happy endings.<eos> And I will.<eos> I'm just not sure how at this moment.<eos> I think I might have an idea.<eos> Do you know how the Snow Queen got the idea for the curse?<eos> It's from a legend called the Trolden Glass.<eos> - Never heard of it.
Don't be ridiculous, dearie.<eos> When Belle and Henry wake up tomorrow morning in New York City, they won't remember a thing about tonight.<eos> I'll tell then the Snow Queen destroyed Storybrooke, whilst I saved everyone I could.<eos> I won't be a villain.<eos> I'll be a hero.<eos> _<eos> Stop.<eos> This must end, Ingrid.<eos> Our magic is a part of us now.<eos> We control it, and we control it really well.
Oh. Oh, no. Oh.<eos> [Growling, yelling on tv] How can you know what's going on in the movie with your eyes covered?<eos> It's too scary, Danny.<eos> Just describe it to me.<eos> Okay, the lights are flickering, faceless kids are coming through the mirror right now.<eos> What?<eos> - It's all going to hell.<eos> Danny, stop describing it so well, it's worse than just watching it.<eos> Wait a minute... Isn't this movie still in the theaters?<eos> Mm-hmm. I stole it from the Internet.

Yes.<eos> Some of the subjects were quite traumatized and resentful.<eos> And... maybe vengeful? Some.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm gonna need those video files, along with the names of those subjects.<eos> I'm sorry, but that information falls under doctor-patient confidentiality.<eos> Okay, Skinner.<eos> My simulated sun is shining.<eos> My blood is in the soil pack.<eos> Now let us see how these plants absorb it.
Yes, Jay, time is cruel.<eos> My Prince Charming wig -- it's gone.<eos> Okay, what do you think -- handsome Hawaiian or sexy scotsman?<eos> I can't do this right now.<eos> Come on, Jay -- this is my farewell tour of trick-or-treating in the neighborhood.<eos> I have to go out strong.<eos> Or should I just do what people are expecting?<eos> Stay home 'cause you're 20?<eos> Jay, please don't be mean to Manny.<eos> Maybe Stella took your wig and buried it in the yard.

Sounds personal.<eos> Next of kin?<eos> Not yet, but check this out.<eos> Dust circles on the mantelpiece.<eos> Some item is missing. Burglary?<eos> I noticed a tan line on the husband's wrist.<eos> No watch found in his belongings.<eos> Check out smiley face.<eos> Why is he front and center?<eos> I snapped the picture of it, already forwarded it to Max.
I understand murders happen all the time in New York.<eos> Part of why I avoid coming here.<eos> And what do we owe the pleasure of your company?<eos> My mother likes to shop.<eos> I like golfing in Sands Point.<eos> But thankfully, this time tomorrow, I will be out of your country.<eos> You're not gonna visit your brother while you're here?<eos> Hey, the lady asked you a question.<eos> I noticed.<eos> - I suggest you answer it, unless you...
This says 70.<eos> - She'll love it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Hello. Madame?<eos> We have a lovely new collection of lingerie.<eos> It's over in intimate apparel.<eos> I'm not interested in lingerie today.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If I may, our line is conservative with just a touch of naughty.<eos> We call it the Judi Fench collection.
What guy's hand, homeowner?<eos> I don't know if he owned the place, but I'm pretty sure he owned the box.<eos> Where is he now?<eos> My guess, halfway to Chicago Med.<eos> He was pretty banged up when they loaded him into the ambo.<eos> Hey, call dispatch, get a twenty on that ambulance.<eos> I want somebody with that guy when they roll into Chicago Med.<eos> So you didn't touch the box or its contents?<eos> No.<eos> Didn't open it?
Two hours ago.<eos> - Right after my testimony.<eos> William, I told the court that she should spend the rest of her days in an asylum.<eos> If she is innocent, - I may well have condemned her. - Hmm.<eos> The trial's half over and you want to start an investigation?<eos> Aren't you two about to get married?<eos> Sir, Station House Number 5 investigated the case, and as we know, they aren't always as thorough as they could be.<eos> Not that they'll enjoy having that pointed out to them. Who sent the postcard?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> - And why send it to you?

He said things were "dope."<eos> I want to monitor the situation.<eos> I need to get somewhere with an Internet connection and a landline. You live out here.<eos> Do you have a home office?<eos> Well, yeah, but Zeke is in that room, and... Perfect.<eos> Let's go there.<eos> Or my neighbors are out of town.<eos> We could break into their place.<eos> Fine, we'll go to my house.<eos> Or as Zeke calls it, tiny Terry's hobbit hole.
And we said, "Well, we'll be able to identify "who this person is, this person is, this person is," 'cause at that point, we had cooperators that would point to us...<eos> "This is so-and-so;<eos> this is so-and-so."<eos> Time goes by, and I kind of, like, look over, and I saw a quick glance.<eos> I'm giving it a little bit more time, but I'm getting the heebie-jeebies.<eos> I'm saying, "Something's up, the way they're looking at us."<eos> I said, "Tom, that's enough.<eos> Wrap it up.<eos> We got everybody."<eos> As I start the van, vroom, of course they know no one's come in and out of that van, and they've had their eye on it.
We were purchasing large amounts of cocaine from Baron Perez and Adam Diaz.<eos> We used to stop at my house on the way home to drop off the coke.<eos> It was, like, huge bricks of glimmering, primo cocaine in my kitchen.<eos> My wife was disgusted, disappointed... you know, "We got enough money.<eos> We don't need to be doing this."<eos> "Please, please stop."<eos> At this point, we had some nice cash sitting around, the two of us.<eos> Said, "Why don't we just back the cocaine operation financially?"<eos> We enlisted one dealer and set him up in business.<eos> They mainly had this guy Harry distribute it.
I don't know how Kenny honestly felt about me doing it.<eos> He's becoming wired. He's becoming paranoid.<eos> I don't think it bothered him so much.<eos> On January 2nd of 1992, I made the first cocaine purchase from Harry.<eos> When the undercover sends the coke to the lab, we have quantitative and qualitative tests done on the cocaine; it comes back 95% pure.<eos> Somebody was bringing pure coke into Suffolk County.<eos> Based on your personal knowledge, why weren't other police officers in your command turning you in?<eos> 'Cause I'm still a cop.<eos> Cops don't turn in other cops.<eos> He's doing coke... as fast as he can get it from Diaz is as fast as he's doing.
You know, Johnny Cash had a hard time getting along there.<eos> Well, think about it, if you're a businessman and you're trying to create the finest product, the best singer is not always the best songwriter.<eos> Do you know what I mean?<eos> So you get the best bass player, you get the best drummer, you get the best singer, and you get the best song.<eos> And that...<eos> It's all about product, you know?<eos> What you get is an industry, a system with rules.<eos> And when you have those things, you always have people that are ready to break them... or work around them.<eos> Before Whitney sang the song, there's this story that I tell about when Elvis was planning to record "I Will Always Love You."<eos> And he had it all worked up and I told everybody that he was recording' it and they'd invited me down to the studio.
Is it a vocal mic?<eos> You know what it is after a few Pabst Blue Ribbon.<eos> Fucking PBR, ba-by!<eos> Well, Dave started the studio with Fred just 20 years ago.<eos> Him and Fred became friends in L.A. before the studio was opened.<eos> Catching knew Fred Drake who had moved out of Los Angeles to kind of get away.<eos> Fred ran a studio called Dominion Way.<eos> It was in Hollywood...<eos> He was the engineer, and we all became really good friends with him 'cause he was such a great guy and he was an amazing engineer and musician.<eos> And he really wanted to come out here and just have a little studio that he could write his own music and enjoy life a little more than he was enjoying it in L.A.
We had to find our place.<eos> And then we got the bright idea to get a generator, get away from the cops, get away from the neighbors, come out in the middle of nowhere, raise hell and blow shit up, get drunk, you know, have fun.<eos> They would take a generator out to a pre-designated area of the desert, tell a few friends who would tell a few friends, who would tell a few friends, turn some trucks in with headlights.<eos> There was an abandoned road that crumbled off the edge of this wash.<eos> The people were down in the wash and the band set up on the asphalt.<eos> And it was a perfect natural stage.<eos> In these canyons, you'd play and there's fires lit and some people dancing around.<eos> It was fun for me to play on mushrooms whenever possible.<eos> And we'd go out in the desert and jam, not because there was nowhere to play, but there was nowhere to play where you could get that fucked up.<eos> You know, the way a scene starts, but some catalyst kicks it into motion.
It was very difficult to hear New Orleans jazz in New Orleans a few years ago.<eos> So we rented an old art gallery and began Preservation Hall.<eos> Both of your parents took the responsibility?<eos> Yeah, well, my mom was like the bouncer.<eos> She sat at the gate all night collecting money and like, deciding on who would get in and who wouldn't, because people would be rowdy. And my dad was the guy who was going around town locating musicians and putting the bands together and kind of keeping the place physically in shape.<eos> People are sitting on wooden benches, sitting on the floor.<eos> There's no drinks.<eos> Pretty hot in here, too, in the summer.<eos> People come to hear the music.<eos> People hear it.
And also, New York radio was very powerful.<eos> You're listening to the Spinners, but then also you're getting into Steely Dan.<eos> You're getting a little bit of Gladys Knight and the Pips, but you're also getting "Band On the Run."<eos> Even at the creative level, the making of music in this city is a business.<eos> In Tin Pan Alley, legendary home of Broadway's tune splishers and composers, the nation's popular songs are created.<eos> The original song factory would be Tin Pan Alley.<eos> There was the Gershwins, Irving Berlin.<eos> People wrote songs to be popular. You know, you bought the sheet music.<eos> Sheet music was the first records.<eos> When they created the music industry, they created it from a completely different place.
The Magic Shop.<eos> Do you remember much about Steve?<eos> Is he still alive?<eos> - He's still alive.<eos> - Okay, good.<eos> Just wanted to check.<eos> Come on in and I'll show you the live room.<eos> So much about a studio is the atmosphere that it's given by its boss.<eos> Whereas Steve, you know, you can just feel the music coming out of him.<eos> He just breathes it.
Before the opening in Boston, the costumes were sitting in the railway station, and there was $55,000 to pay for them.<eos> And I was trying to think who in Hollywood could send me<eos> $55,000... In the next three hours.<eos> I thought, "Harry Cohn. "<eos> Only one with the courage to do it.<eos> I called him up, I said, "I've got the greatest story you've ever read," and I turned the paperback around that the girl in the box office was reading.<eos> It was called "The Man I Killed. "<eos> And I says, "It's called 'The Man I Killed,' written by such and such, a paperback, buy it!"<eos> I said, "You get me $55,000 to Boston-"<eos> "And I will make it for you if you'll send me $47,000 in two hours. "
Is it too personal to ask what age it started at?<eos> Well, if I tell you, you won't believe it, so I'd better not answer.<eos> He was notoriously flirtatious with both sexes.<eos> He used to love to lie in a bath and do interviews with his associates, which embarrassed some of them and perhaps delighted others, I don't know.<eos> I myself have absolutely no evidence that Wells ever had any kind of sexual relationship with a man, but he was very, very conscious that it was something that he could use.<eos> It's the business of the director, is to carry on a continual courtship with the people he sticks in front of the lens.<eos> And when you deal with stars, you know, real stars, you have to... You have to really make love.<eos> Personally, I don't like a girlfriend to have a husband.<eos> If she'll fool a husband, I figure she'll fool me. George.<eos> Even though this is a more conventional thriller with a movie star at the heart of it, the film is much more surrealistic, much more strange, and all the more strange because, when the studio doctored it, they put into it these big close-ups of Rita Hayworth, and they add to the surreal quality of the film.
And then, miraculously, two of them.<eos> And on each moon, there were numbers, and I realized they were the clock faces of the Gare d'Orsay.<eos> And I remembered that the Gare d'Orsay was empty.<eos> And at 5:30 in the morning, I went downstairs, got in a cab, crossed the Seine, and entered this empty railway station where I discovered the world of Kafka.<eos> It has been said that the logic of this story is the logic of a dream.<eos> Orson's view of Josef K.<eos> Was that, far from being the innocent victim of bureaucracy that Kafka had written that- but, in Orson's version, and I can hear him saying,<eos> "He's guilty as hell. "<eos> He would like to tell a story to make a metaphor about his vision of the world, speaking about how we can feel guilty without being guilty.<eos> I saw it as a European story, full of old European bric-a-brac, With IBM machines lurking in the background.
NOPD tried to pull him over on a random traffic stop.<eos> He led them on a wild-goose chase, hoping to get away with that stolen loot.<eos> Why you looking at us like that?<eos> Waiting for the first question.<eos> Navy or Marines?<eos> Neither. He murk some seaman when he robbed him?<eos> Nope, no direct military connection to our dead man.<eos> Then why are we here?<eos> That stolen gun is Navy-issued.<eos> So we find the owner and return it.
I knew Loretta Wade was a keeper.<eos> Oh, Agent Pride, this is, uh, Jacob's brother Esau and Paul Hare, close friend of Jacob's and mine for... Close to forever.<eos> Here's the medication.<eos> I'll get you some water.<eos> So, you, um, you found Jacob's gun.<eos> Recovered as part of a likely robbery.<eos> You said in the past that Jacob had his gun the night he was murdered?<eos> I saw it with him when he left the house.<eos> He was pretty sure he'd meet up with resistance.<eos> And he had it with him at the recruitment site?
Later that night, uh, we got a call from the police, informing us that Jacob was dead.<eos> When we went to claim Jacob's body, this gun, his gun, was missing from the holster.<eos> We'd like to reopen the case.<eos> We would need to reexamine all of the evidence.<eos> Including... Jacob's body.<eos> With the advancements in DNA technology, we could find evidence that helps solve the case.<eos> Here, I'll help you.<eos> You find who killed my husband.<eos> Jacob Tarlow's gun.<eos> We know where the burglar stole it from?
I was defending myself.<eos> A few punches were thrown, then we went our separate ways.<eos> If that's the case, then why was Jacob's gun, taken off his dead body, stolen from your house two days ago?<eos> Whoa, that was the Jew's gun?<eos> Yes.<eos> Damn, small world.<eos> Look, if I would have killed Tarlow,<eos> I'd have taken full credit for it.<eos> The gun was simply a souvenir of the time.<eos> I bought it off some cop a couple months after Tarlow's... suicide.
Hamilton gets a hold of Tarlow's gun...<eos> And uses the blunt weapon to kill Jacob.<eos> Hangs him to cover up what he's done.<eos> And then, maybe as insurance, sells the gun to Brick, so that, should it ever be found...<eos> All signs point towards the Brigade and the lynching.<eos> Have I ever told you how high I get from tracking down the truth?<eos> Thank you, Dwayne.<eos> Thank me when I tie Tom Hamilton to the gun.<eos> Because of Loretta's discovery,<eos> I stopped looking at the gun ballistically and examined it materially, from a blunt-force trauma perspective.
I thought we should talk.<eos> Thank you for saving my life... twice, actually.<eos> Forget about it.<eos> I can't because Robin can't.<eos> I see the way you two look at one another. And I understand.<eos> For me, it's only been a short time that I've been away. But for him, years have passed.<eos> His heart moved on.<eos> He's in love with you, Regina.<eos> And I think you're in love with him.<eos> Well, it doesn't really matter. He's a man of honor. He made a vow to you, and he's going to keep it.
Same goes for this broken champagne glass.<eos> Left after the Hornet's trick shot.<eos> Confirms... somebody used it for a different kind of trick.<eos> This is weird.<eos> Check out these marks left in blood.<eos> What's it look like to you?<eos> Looks like a ball rolled through the blood, landed in the corner pocket.<eos> Only one problem.<eos> There's no ball in there.<eos> Well, maybe the killer took it.
Oh, a long time ago. I-I used to wait tables where he bartended.<eos> I thought he was in prison.<eos> Yeah, he got out.<eos> Bubbles?<eos> Where are you?<eos> !<eos> And you need to let us in.<eos> Come on, Bubbles, fetch me a beer.<eos> Make it snappy this time.<eos> Why don't you go and fetch it yourself?
None of your business.<eos> We're not friends anymore, which means you can't just show up unannounced at my door.<eos> Good-bye. Hey, Caroline.<eos> Look.<eos> You're not safe.<eos> Tripp's men still have your name.<eos> So, what?<eos> You here to protect me?<eos> News flash!<eos> I don't need your protection, and more importantly, I don't want it.
Whatever you did for Elena, that's her choice.<eos> Remember that.<eos> No pun intended.<eos> I am not on painkillers.<eos> In fact, I feel awful, but I am enjoying every miserable human moment of pain.<eos> To being powerless and mundane.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Ahh. So I guess we are both formerly supernatural beings.<eos> Should we start a support group?<eos> Well, technically, I relinquished my magic and put it away for safekeeping.
This should all be a bigger deal.<eos> They tricked me good.<eos> Instead of using the power of the eclipse for the merge, my dad used it to send me here, and where'd Jo's magic go?<eos> You know, it made zero sense.<eos> Magic doesn't just, like, disappear, but then you made yours disappear when you hid it in Ms. Cuddles, and it hit me.<eos> My sneaky little twin sister hid her magic...<eos> In this. Still there.<eos> Still here and still full of magic.<eos> Well, it was.<eos> I just sucked it out.
Got him?<eos> You're under arrest for making a threat against a police officer.<eos> Get him out of here.<eos> Let's go!<eos> This way.<eos> Criminal threat gets him 4 years.<eos> All you've done is bought your victim a little breathing room.<eos> There's something else.<eos> I think Chad was telling the truth about the bomb.<eos> He didn't set it.
He didn't set it.<eos> Then it was one of his skinheads.<eos> No.<eos> Chad wouldn't have authorized that.<eos> He was contemptuous about the bomb, like it was beneath him.<eos> Right.<eos> He doesn't want to kill Mark.<eos> He wants him back.<eos> Exactly.<eos> OK. So who set it?
Come on, you're really gonna risk a murder charge to protect the privacy of a client?<eos> I didn't kill Richard.<eos> No, but you did do this.<eos> The lash marks are mine.<eos> How about the bruises on his throat?<eos> Your client died of asphyxiation.<eos> We know that you choked him.<eos> Right, but that's not what killed him.<eos> My medical examiner already gave us the cause of death.<eos> Your M.E. was wrong -- not about the asphyxiation, but about what caused it.
Are you with a client?<eos> Well, that depends -- on why you're here.<eos> I was in the neighborhood, and I wanted to talk to you about erotic electrocution.<eos> Talk about cutting to the chase.<eos> It seems to me that you are uniquely qualified to paint a portrait of our killer.<eos> You have...keen acumen.<eos> Electrocution is something I use sparingly -- usually on the back.<eos> Other times, somewhere else.<eos> How can it turn deadly?<eos> If the person administering it doesn't know what they're doing.
- Hello?<eos> Hey, Hanson, keep the line open.<eos> I've heard this interference before.<eos> Looks like Iona's got a bug problem.<eos> Surveillance device?<eos> And it's one of ours.<eos> I don't know anything about surveillance.<eos> I'm just a retired cop living on a pension.<eos> Really?<eos> 'cause you checked out that unit in May of '02, And you never returned it.
But how could she forgive him?<eos> This man has betrayed her, made her fall in love with him.<eos> But now he's tearing that away.<eos> She's not marrying a prince she's marrying a charlatan.<eos> Exactly.<eos> So she tries to leave, but he prevents her.<eos> Maybe it's her pen... falls out of her purse.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Rage bottled up in her, overwhelmed her.<eos> She sees the pen on the ground, grabs it.
Good morning.<eos> I'm terribly sorry to intrude.<eos> Frederick, maybe we can catch up later.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure, ma.<eos> ♪ That's how strong my love is ♪ Have a wonderful day.<eos> I've been thinking about what we should call our new church.<eos> My wife, Janine, suggested "New Life Church", which I think seems appropriate on many levels.<eos> We're still taking suggestions, if there's any.<eos> No matter what we call it, some people out there may not like the idea of a church that ministers to the returned.
A tornado that hates computers.<eos> And arcade games.<eos> They took everything-- laptops, hard drives.<eos> Surge protectors.<eos> Who steals surge protectors? !<eos> It's a good thing our standard operating procedure is to heavily encrypt all data.<eos> My house, your garage-- they're hitting everything today.<eos> Okay, so the question is: why do all this?<eos> Why not lay in wait and then take the hard drive?<eos> They know we have it they'll be back for it.
- Just work. - Mm.<eos> Okay.<eos> I went to a party at the Theta house.<eos> It was supposed to start their Thanksgiving food drive.<eos> I was only going to bring canned stuff.<eos> Sorry, I'm not used to talking like this.<eos> But Troy was there, and he said I should at least stick around for a little while.<eos> I remembered all the Red Zone stuff they told us at orientation about how many freshman girls get, you know, assaulted in the first few months of school from drinking too much.<eos> But I was careful.<eos> I got my own drink, I didn't put it down.
Yeah?<eos> Cary, it's me.<eos> I'm in your apartment.<eos> Okay, he's in.<eos> Come on up.<eos> Kalinda. You're not supposed to be here.<eos> Look, just five minutes.<eos> - I've hired you a bodyguard.<eos> - I'm fine. This FBI tap is fake.<eos> Bishop couldn't have been home when the FBI said they taped it.
I felt... destroyed.<eos> We're not saying he flipped, Lemond,<eos> - but the cops smell blood here.<eos> - We're seen as weak.<eos> Then what do we do?<eos> He's a white lawyer.<eos> I'm not saying it's real or faked, but there are no edits.<eos> Is it Bishop's voice?<eos> Get me a tape on him, I'll tell you positively.<eos> When do you need it?
- Why?<eos> - It's the smart move.<eos> A.J. Called the A.D.A.'s bluff.<eos> He just assumed that he'd get away with it regardless.<eos> What, he's probably worried about P.R., he's trying to avoid community service.<eos> So, great, he gets away with everything.<eos> Everything?<eos> Look, there's not a lot here.<eos> Any footage from the stairwell?<eos> Amaro and Rollins are tracking it down.

I know the terms, Ray.<eos> But Berlin predates it.<eos> You ordered the bombing in Kursk.<eos> Then you pinned it on me.<eos> You blamed me for killing his daughter.<eos> Some years ago, a copy of this photo was left on the corpse of an associate of mine.<eos> Taking it as a warning, I traced the girl to a man they call The Stewmaker.<eos> He told me a story about the girl.<eos> She was sent to him by a man she'd never met.<eos> She was in trouble, needed to disappear, so he took her photo, put it in a locket, and sent it to her father.
When I was a kid, I was a railroad buff.<eos> These bracelets come from Harlem.<eos> These I have such a long time, I don't even remember where they came from, but they were like slivers of black, so I love them.<eos> And then these are just things I've been collecting over the years.<eos> anyway-<eos> Another mad outfit.<eos> These are my shoes, smoking slippers.<eos> Suede, embroidered.<eos> This kind of tunic is from the Mao people, Chinese minority.<eos> It had a big hood, and I didn't like the hood, so I made it into a collar.
This is Iris Apfel, and she is a legendary collector, um, of fashion.<eos> Exhibits of her fashions in museums like the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute drew record crowds.<eos> And that was in 2005.<eos> I went.<eos> It was extraordinary.<eos> And tell us what you're wearing right now, Iris.<eos> Oh, this actually I bought many years ago for my darling husband, and...<eos> You bought this shirt?<eos> Yeah, this was done by Versace.<eos> He painted it himself.
And that was in 2005.<eos> I went.<eos> It was extraordinary.<eos> And tell us what you're wearing right now, Iris.<eos> Oh, this actually I bought many years ago for my darling husband, and...<eos> You bought this shirt?<eos> Yeah, this was done by Versace.<eos> He painted it himself.<eos> It's leather.<eos> So I grabbed it, and I took it home.
I should hang the risk and kill him.<eos> Leave me with this mess all on my own?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> You're not getting off that easy. Oh...<eos> That's Jenny.<eos> Let's move.<eos> I found the chapter Katrina told us to look up.<eos> "God wrote the Ineffable Name upon Methuselah's Sword.<eos> For man to wield it would consume his soul in fire."
So you don't think I can bring it?<eos> Well?<eos> I think you can bring it.<eos> Watch me.<eos> Stay back.<eos> This is it.<eos> This is real.<eos> Come on, man. Surgery?<eos> We've all had surgery.<eos> You've all had it, but have you ever seen it?
He said i can live with him after i leave the hospital.<eos> His wife's family owns a car dealership, So i can help around the office after school.<eos> It's not a lot of money, But i listed it on the income and expense declaration.<eos> I also have proof of enrollment at a nearby high school.<eos> Nice touch.<eos> Judges like to see that emancipated minors Still take their education seriously.<eos> And now that we've got the completed application, Your mother's consent, all we need is the filing fee.<eos> There's a filing fee?<eos> Yeah.<eos> They bury it in the fine print.
And to listen to your body. And when you have a setback?<eos> [ groans ]<eos> If you're gonna fall, that's how you do it. Emma:<eos> What do you mean by setback?<eos> Emma, when you first got here, You thought that if you ate something bad, you were bad. You were a failure.<eos> You thought you were doomed.<eos> Yes.<eos> And i've learned that that's not true.<eos> Food is not the enemy. It is a vital part of life,<eos> And we need it to stay alive. Do you think you can sustain
Yeah, in a minute.<eos> What kind of music is your son into?<eos> He digs all kinds of music.<eos> He used to really be into this song by The Proclaimers that we would play for him at bedtime.<eos> Sort of became a staple in the Hutchison-family dance-party mix.<eos> Those were some good times.<eos> You... you want to walk me through the chords?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's... it's easy.<eos> Um, I play it in C, so it's just C, F, and G. Um... ♪ And I would walk 500 Miles ♪ ♪ And I would walk 500 more ♪
Homosexuality is wrong, and that's from god's word.<eos> Come on.<eos> I really felt that I was born a boy.<eos> When I would go to the restroom, I would try to stand up and use the restroom.<eos> I wanted to be a man so bad that I would have a strap-on in my boxers and walk around all day.<eos> I mean, that's how bad I was.<eos> I was always attracted to older women.<eos> I've had four major relationships. I've had four major relationships.<eos> I just completely turned my back on god.<eos> That's when I started feeling the guilt, but I would push it away.
What's the problem?<eos> The problem is don't bring anything that you're going to put into your mouth into a bathroom stall.<eos> Well, add toilet-brushing to the list of things that you are passionate about.<eos> That, and limited the number of add/drops.<eos> There should be unlimited add/drops in our league!<eos> No, that's a battle for another day.<eos> Right now, I just want to know what animal would do this.<eos> Enough out of you, Ruxin.<eos> Taco, what's going on with the new place?<eos> When can we see it?
So soon?<eos> It's only midday.<eos> We could easily make it across the river.<eos> Reuben, tell the others to start making camp.<eos> Yes, father.<eos> Perhaps if one of us shared his tent tonight, it might calm him.<eos> It should be you.<eos> I found some yarrow root.<eos> The brew should help him sleep.<eos> I'll bring it to him.
Here's your boyfriend, Tammy.<eos> I found him on the ground.<eos> You should really be more careful.<eos> Great.<eos> Now he's got ground on him.<eos> Sorry the candle smells like lavender.<eos> Kind of changes the vibe a little bit.<eos> Yeah. I'm feeling really relaxed all of a sudden.<eos> The door slammed shut!<eos> Well, somebody open it!
I repeat, code orange.<eos> What's the hurry?<eos> An incoming mass casualty.<eos> A chemical spill in the morgue.<eos> Right, that's no chemical spill.<eos> Contagion must have activated someone's trouble.<eos> This is exactly why we need the vaccine.<eos> I'm giving Charlotte the rest of the aether.<eos> I gave you the safe's combination for insurance, not so you...<eos> That's exactly why you gave it to me.
Then clean this floor until it shines.<eos> The ringing of the bell commands you.<eos> Yes, Auntie Whispers.<eos> You know I do this for you, child.<eos> Keeping you busy is the only way to keep evil spirits from - driving you to wickedness.<eos> - Do not worry,<eos> Auntie Whispers. The work shall keep me busy.<eos> Good night, my dear.<eos> And dowse that fire.<eos> I did not ask you to light it.
Greg, it's Halloween.<eos> Candy is free. Old lady Daniels says nothing in this world is free.<eos> Oh, hey, and look!<eos> I also got this rock. Hey, Wirt, want to learn some rock facts?<eos> So, you want to go look for frogs with me like you said you would awhile ago and haven't done it yet?<eos> - Nah.<eos> - Is that bee named Sara?<eos> - W-What?<eos> - Your tape says "for Sara."<eos> Are you gonna give it to Sara the bee?
- Nah.<eos> - Is that bee named Sara?<eos> - W-What?<eos> - Your tape says "for Sara."<eos> Are you gonna give it to Sara the bee?<eos> I-I want to, but ...<eos> I can't. - Can I see it?<eos> - Yeah. It's just a tape.<eos> Hmm. Yeah.<eos> Okay, I'll give it to her for you.
I won't do this!<eos> You've been grinding up lost souls for years.<eos> I didn't know!<eos> I didn't know this is where the edelwood trees came from!<eos> And would it have mattered?<eos> Would you have just let your daughter's spirit burn out forever?<eos> Feed the lantern.<eos> - No.<eos> - I suppose, after all these years, you just don't care for her anymore.<eos> Hold your tongue, or I'll remove it from your mouth!

I mean, I did tell him that you loved me, too, but I was just messing with his head.<eos> All you have to do is turn your back, and you and that Fitz guy can dance off into the sun.<eos> Don't ever talk about me and the sun and another man again.<eos> Don't ever do that.<eos> I know I shouldn't be here.<eos> But when you canceled, I...<eos> I got worried, so I pulled some strings and got your home address and...<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Your home is perfect, Cyrus.<eos> Exactly the way I imagined it.
Once we've done that, I'll return to my office.<eos> There will be a man there waiting for me.<eos> He'll take my badge and escort me to my car.<eos> You, Sir, will immediately summon Red and discuss what kind of statement to make.<eos> She'll want you to bury me.<eos> You'll say no, but she'll insist.<eos> Listen to her.<eos> Build yourself up by knocking me down.<eos> You have a war to fight ... a bad war, a stupid war.<eos> And if this were two days ago, I'd stop you from fighting it.
Just like a game of cricket, the way the universe played out to create us humans was not determined by the rules alone.<eos> Chance played a part, too.<eos> This temple's over a thousand years old, it's dedicated to Lord Shiva the Destroyer and it's built in the Tantric tradition, which is at least in part a celebration of pleasure.<eos> But whilst I find some of these suggestions instructive, that's not why we're here.<eos> We're here because of the location of this temple.<eos> Because this temple is in the centre of a crater, three kilometres wide.<eos> Geologists are still debating what made it but it could well be the scar left by a meteorite smashing into the Earth.<eos> Throughout its lifetime the Earth has been constantly bombarded by objects from space.<eos> Think about one particular collision, the impact that probably wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, and think about the history, the lifetime of that rock that smashed into the Earth.<eos> Imagine one particular day in the lifetime of that rock, on one orbit, perhaps billions of years ago, when another rock, no bigger than that, instead of missing it, hit it, smashed into it and changed its orbit very, very slightly.
these random numbers got chosen, then how lucky are we that we exist?<eos> How lucky are we that we live in a universe where those constants are just right to allow galaxies to from and stars to shine and elements like carbon to form in the hearts of stars?<eos> So what could account for the uncanny precision of this set of numbers?<eos> Hello, can I have just one?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, our universe, with all its beautiful laws of nature and its finely tuned constants, feels incredibly lucky.<eos> I mean, it's like buying a lottery ticket and winning the lottery, but it's stranger than that, because it's like winning the lottery in which only one ticket was ever printed.<eos> But that's of course not how a lottery works.<eos> Yes, it is extremely unlikely that I'll win the lottery with this ticket, but there are millions of tickets printed so it's not surprising at all that someone wins it.
All of these islands have risen up out of the ocean, seemingly from nothing.<eos> And it's even happening right now.<eos> This island, called Nishinoshima, has been growing steadily since it suddenly appeared in November 2013.<eos> If we didn't know better, we might ascribe that creation to the act of the gods, but we do know better because we know about geology, we've done some science, so we know that the origin of this island is volcanism.<eos> It comes from the inner heat of the Earth, which is itself a leftover from the history of its formation 4½ billion years ago.<eos> So we have a mechanism for the creation of new land.<eos> Contrast that with the scientific explanation for the origin of the most important thing of all, the origin of the universe itself, and for decades we've been happy to say the universe began at the Big Bang and it's almost as if we're not to ask what happened before.<eos> There was nothing before, there's no scientific mechanism to explain how the Big Bang occurred.<eos> But there are now plausible theories that provide a mechanism for how universes might be made from apparently nothing.<eos> So what is this magical theory that explains the origin of the universe, and how did we find it?
It looked like a battlefield, it was totally beat up.<eos> It was as they emerged from behind the desolate lunar surface for the third time that our perception of the Earth changed for ever.<eos> When we finally turned around and were going forward, like a car driving on down the highway, we saw for the first time the Earth come up on the lunar horizon.<eos> I set the range at infinity, pointed it at the Earth and just started clicking away, changing the F-stop with every click.<eos> The photograph was the shotgun approach, figuring one of them was going to hit, and indeed it did.<eos> The photograph Anders took is known as Earthrise.<eos> One of THE iconic images of our time.<eos> After the flight, I've often been asked what I thought was the most significant part of Apollo 8, its biggest contribution, and I've often said our mission really was to explore the moon, but our accomplishment was that we discovered the Earth.<eos> It was only by looking back at our planet from afar that we felt just how small and delicate a part of the universe our fragile world really is.<eos> When I look up and realise that the moon is a long way off, 240,000 miles, and sometimes it's hard to imagine that we actually zipped all the way up there and around it 11 times and back, in this day and age.
He imagined himself riding on a beam of light.<eos> And, by wondering what he might see, transformed our understanding of space and time.<eos> But it was his re-imagining of an experiment dreamt up by Galileo in the 1500s that laid the foundations of modern cosmology.<eos> Einstein called it the happiest thought of my life.<eos> Which is in itself an almost childlike sentence, because following that thought through ultimately led us to a theory of the origin of the universe itself.<eos> And there's a place where you can see with your eyes what Einstein saw in his mind.<eos> This is NASA's space power facility near Cleveland, Ohio, and it is the world's biggest vacuum chamber.<eos> It's used to test spacecraft in the conditions of outer space and it does that by pumping out the 30 tonnes of air in this chamber until there are about two grams left.<eos> It's kind of got an eccentric construction, which is part of its history.<eos> It was built in the 1960s as a nuclear test facility to test nuclear propulsion systems, and that meant that they built it out of aluminium to make the radiation easier to deal with.
Then incinerated after his death.<eos> That's a new one.<eos> How did you know all that?<eos> There's no sign of soot in his mouth.<eos> Or the nostrils.<eos> If this man were alive when he was burned, he would've inhaled super-heated air, causing significant fire damage and soot in the nostrils and mouth.<eos> Okay, but we still need evidence of foul play to turn this into a homicide, and...all I see is ash.<eos> You see, that's where you're wrong.<eos> Beneath this carbonized layer of skin lie immaculate strata of muscles and soft tissue.<eos> Burning a body doesn't destroy evidence, as one might assume, but preserves it.
So you killed him and took the only thing that was worth something.<eos> Look, I wasn't the only one whose face Izzy was in that night.<eos> Did he happen to tell you where all this money was coming from?<eos> Ever since I've known him,<eos> Izzy claimed that his pops was the one who really wrote "6 A.M.", that Lionel Hubbard, jazz legend, cheated him out of a single.<eos> Can you imagine that?<eos> Killing someone literally for a song?<eos> It's not just a song.<eos> "6 A.M." Changed everything.<eos> That track broke all the rules, changing keys and time signatures as if the person who wrote it had so much joy inside his heart he couldn't pick just one way to let it out.
You got Garfield in a hammock, saying, "I'm not overweight.<eos> I'm under-tall,"<eos> I'll build you a gallery right here.<eos> Look, you should move on.<eos> My friend doesn't want you-- how shall I put this?<eos> Taking a giant knit in front of our shop.<eos> What is the problem?<eos> It is not even your bike.<eos> It's been chained here for, like, four months. Oh, yeah?<eos> Maybe it is our bike, and we use it for deliveries and to trap nerds.
- Is that true?<eos> - Fucking pensioners<eos> They'll brag that they used to foster kids and can take care of Léo<eos> No one cares that they were a foster family<eos> This is about you and your ability to care for Léo<eos> These accusations of multiple partners - are they true?<eos> Of course not!<eos> This is rubbish. They're gunning for me<eos> They say it wasn't the first time you'd taken Sandrine's bank card<eos> I didn't take it. She lent it to me.

- A pretty black girl of about 20<eos> Now that things have died down, maybe she'll come back<eos> - And the robbers?<eos> - No.<eos> We don't know them it's the third time they've raided cash points here it's often for small change<eos> They've taken about 30,000 Euros.<eos> Not much, considering the risks<eos> The hooded guy on fire...<eos> The picture isn't very clear but if you enlarge it...<eos> The judge has sent it to the lab. She wants to see a clearer image We should get it back soon
I had to hit the pause button.<eos> - May i make an observation?<eos> - You're loyal to voight.<eos> That's admirable.<eos> But you're catching a rep as voight's girl.<eos> The longer you stay here, The more that perception takes hold, And you're just gonna end up carrying that<eos> - I should be so lucky.<eos> - Erin, you could be going places.<eos> Or not.<eos> - Steve, i appreciate the offer, And i am considering it.
Did you know that Ben Franklin-- he...?<eos> He discovered electricity by flying a kite.<eos> No.<eos> If his kite had actually been struck by lightning, the key would have electrocuted him.<eos> It's just a myth.<eos> - I like the way you think, kid.<eos> - Owen, leave the poor man alone.<eos> - Oh. - Okay.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> Yeah. Do you think it's ironic that Mom got you a kite for Christmas, and you never used it?
Could I die in here?<eos> Owen... the people helping you are special, okay?<eos> They won't let that happen to you.<eos> Fire department is proposing a last-ditch idea.<eos> It's not pleasant.<eos> Amputate his leg?<eos> The vibrations from the bone saw would collapse the sinkhole.<eos> We're up against the one thing humans have never been able to defeat: time.<eos> When half a million kids a year were contracting polio, you think Jonas Salk felt like you do?<eos> But when he hit a wall, he shoved it out of the way and he kept going.
Okay.<eos> But I won't be able to free you before the water covers your head.<eos> I-I don't understand.<eos> Well, you have to trust me.<eos> I found a way for you to stay alive without ever taking a breath.<eos> All right?<eos> All right?<eos> Send it down!<eos> Owen, there's a machine up top.<eos> It'll take the blood from your body, add oxygen to it, and then send it back into your blood, okay?
Is that really what you want to go with?<eos> 'Cause on top of the HACE, Captain Holland's parachute was tampered with-- either by the competition or by you.<eos> So, quite frankly, I think you're hiding something from me.<eos> This warrant is worthless without being cosigned by a military judge.<eos> I don't need JAG approval, and you know it.<eos> Okay, boys.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Move out.<eos> You really want to cooperate with me, give me the decryption key for the code from the black box on Holland's wingsuit.<eos> I don't have it.
You don't think I'm immortal.<eos> Guess I'll have to prove it.<eos> No!<eos> - No, don't do that!<eos> - I believe you!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Come on!<eos> It may come as a surprise, but I still fear death.<eos> Tonight, my anonymous caller faced it without hesitation.
- She's over there.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Miss Cranston?<eos> Detective Murdoch of the Toronto Constabulary.<eos> - Oh, good day, Detective!<eos> - I understand you recently purchased a novella from the Belair Bookshop?<eos> - Yes.<eos> By Mark Twain.<eos> - May I see it?<eos> - Oh, I don't have it anymore.

You asked me to.<eos> Henry... you're familiar with the Bertillon system of identification?<eos> Uh... yes, every person has unique features that can be measured.<eos> - Exactly and compared.<eos> - Yes.<eos> What we are attempting to do is to identify the person in this photograph by applying the Bertillon principle.<eos> What we need to do is to compare the relationship between those features to those of the constables from this photograph.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Now, I've created a slide for each of the constables, and I've drilled holes at precise feature locations.<eos> All you have to do is place the slide in the tray, and as you move it forward, if the identity matches, then the features should line up.
Wait.<eos> There was someone else named Dodger...<eos> Constable Hodge.<eos> - You worked with Constable Hodge, didn't you?<eos> - At one time...<eos> And that's why they called him Dodger, because he was your loyal servant. It was him!<eos> - He stole the piece of glass.<eos> - I don't know, and that is the truth of it.<eos> But how could he have known that it was you in the photograph?<eos> How could he have known unless he had... seen it?
Your father called me a fool on national TV.<eos> You don't just spring major policy changes on a live news show.<eos> You think I was supposed to give him a heads up?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> So he could come fully loaded with arguments against?<eos> This isn't court, Bobby.<eos> You didn't need to approach it like a defense attorney, as if he's the enemy and you needed to win at all costs.<eos> I wasn't trying to win anything.<eos> An opportunity presented itself, and I ran with it.
This one. Out of Witynska.<eos> See these two scratches?<eos> They're identical.<eos> - The same murder weapon?<eos> - That's right.<eos> One more thing you might help me with.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Back to work.<eos> Does this key mean anything to you?<eos> - Where did you get it from?
He's got fingers.<eos> Probably knows how to turn on a computer.<eos> You see how strong his accent is?<eos> His native language, Afrikaans, is still his daily tongue.<eos> What's that got to do with it? Putz.<eos> Ice.<eos> Stacks.<eos> The e-mails that Kazmir's employer sent are just rife with slang and colloquialisms.<eos> I'm going back in there... alone... and I'm going to write that man's confession.<eos> He won't sign it.
Okay, everybody, our time is up.<eos> I'll be out of town, but my cell phone will be on.<eos> Okay, just remember, people, it's Vegas, okay?<eos> So, try not to call during peak party hours.<eos> Anytime between 11 and 11:15 in the morning should be okay.<eos> All right, all I have to go do is pack.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> I went upstairs. I already did it for you.<eos> Okay, that's weird.<eos> I didn't pick out outfits. I just took a bunch of your stuff and I threw it in a trash bag.
Where are we?<eos> Callen and Sam are almost at the courthouse.<eos> Agent Sanchez is already there.<eos> Does he have Turner?<eos> Can't find him, but Peña's under heavy guard.<eos> Guys?<eos> I think I found Monica.<eos> Okay, I spotted this van near Monica's place last night around the time of her abduction.<eos> Now, it's the same van in Goodsell's photos.<eos> And Kaleidoscope just picked it up an hour ago parked here.
You can't keep following Adam down these terrible paths.<eos> Let me, let me help you find a real job.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, what would Adam do?<eos> We've always been partners.<eos> Well, maybe when he sees you've given up on the idea, he'll realize it's awful, too.<eos> Oh, come on, it wasn't the worst idea in the world.<eos> And no matter what you say, our food wasn't that bad.<eos> Hey, Deb. Uh, you know all that old food from the restaurant we tossed out back?<eos> I think the raccoons might've gotten to it, because I just found it all in a neat pile on the doorstep.
Robbie, it's Mabel!<eos> Who?<eos> Remember me?<eos> I'm like Girl Dipper.<eos> Ugh, go away.<eos> I heard a "come in."<eos> Ahh!<eos> Hey! Listen, kid, nobody in the Pines family is welcome here.<eos> In case you forgot, your stupid brother is the one who ruined my life!<eos> And Mabel's the one who's gonna fix it.
Now that's what I call a Christmas tree.<eos> Isn't that gorgeous?<eos> The holidays are all about being with loves ones, and I think that's what makes this tradition so special in our town.<eos> It's a reminder that no matter where you turn you have a friend. Aw. Biggest mistake of junior year...<eos> Including the boys in secret santa.<eos> Stefan is officially the worst gift giver.<eos> He got you a snow globe?<eos> Yeah, of Mystic Falls, as if I don't see enough of this town every day as it is.<eos> Well, I love my bracelet.<eos> Of course you do because I am good at secret santa, and I didn't purchase it from a quick stop.
- So you threatened to kill him.<eos> - Yes, Eli.<eos> - I threatened to kill him.<eos> - That was a joke.<eos> You can't joke.<eos> What are we gonna say?<eos> We got to get back to Brian at the Correspondent.<eos> - He's quoting us saying it's false.<eos> - The note.<eos> We have to get the note. Who has it?

Who has it?<eos> - The civics teacher.<eos> - Okay, you need to...<eos> Wait, I thought you said it was the P.E. teacher.<eos> It was addressed to the P.E. teacher.<eos> - Grace gave it to the civics teacher.
She's probably passing Whitmore right now.<eos> If she's not lost.<eos> She has a terrible sense of direction.<eos> You know, I could have sworn that this used to squeak.<eos> It did.<eos> I fixed it.<eos> Bonnie and I came here every day.<eos> It as the closest thing I had to a picture of you, and I needed every reminder I could get.<eos> It's funny.<eos> I used to have so many good memories of this house, and after just one bad one, I burned it down.
There's a stranger in our kitchen.<eos> Hi, Mom.<eos> I'm actually here to talk to Dad.<eos> Geez, get a room.<eos> Look, Dad, I'm sorry about today.<eos> What happened today?<eos> Something irreparable?<eos> I let him draw up an inbound play.<eos> Okay.<eos> Kevin throws it in, everyone else knows what they're doing.
Your father said you were basically useless.<eos> Remember when that happened, we were so happy?<eos> So come on.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> - I gotta go.<eos> - Yes, you have to go right here!<eos> Are you okay, Ma?<eos> I'm as okay as I can be in this Topsy-turvy world.<eos> Maybe we can watch your show with you.<eos> Yeah, Ma, we'll all watch it together.
Deep within the Royal Vault there is a statue called the Palladium.<eos> It is said Atlantis will never fall while it remains within its walls.<eos> Less than an hour ago the Palladium was stolen.<eos> If the army find out about this they will desert and the city will fall.<eos> You want us to retrieve it?
What if there was no body?<eos> My theory is that it was moved.<eos> In certain cultures, rebel factions will display corpses as a show of power.<eos> U.S. serviceman would offer the ultimate bragging right.<eos> Question is: where did they move it to?<eos> Been looking for you.<eos> Oh, just had to get some air.<eos> Heard we got a lead on the jacket.<eos> Barely.<eos> Len Bowers said he bought it from some rug importer named Hameed.
Right now, we're here to talk to you about this jacket.<eos> The one you sold this guy.<eos> Where'd you get it?<eos> At the port.<eos> Here in New Orleans?<eos> In Karachi.<eos> I visit a few times a year to get rugs to sell.<eos> There is a boy, Sami-- he helps me load cargo.<eos> He was wearing the coat.<eos> Why'd you want it?

It's a province about 100 klicks south of Daykundi, which is where the explosion occurred.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Navy LNO in Ghazni located the boy.<eos> They're patching him through right now.<eos> Agent Pride, Lieutenant Commander Blake Conner.<eos> We located the child wrangling odd jobs at the port.<eos> Hi, Sami.<eos> Wanted to ask you a few questions.<eos> Sami... do you remember this jacket?<eos> Can you tell me where you got it?
Surveillance footage is still downloading.<eos> Audrey went to see Dr. Cross today as a patient.<eos> Something's been up with her since the contagion.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> This mean you've decided to trust Charlotte?<eos> I'd like to trust her, Dwight, but it's kind of hard when Audrey's involved.<eos> It's up.<eos> Crocker.<eos> No, wait.<eos> That look on his face, I've seen it a lot.
I knew Charlotte Cross wasn't from the CDC.<eos> Yeah, but not from another world.<eos> Another Highball?<eos> What?<eos> The sun's past the yardarm.<eos> It's a wonder we're not all drunks in this town.<eos> And my leg hurts.<eos> Where's your cream?<eos> That woman gave me that stuff.<eos> I'm not using it beca...
Los Angeles Police Department.<eos> You're not supposed to be back here.<eos> Nora Garcia?<eos> Detective Lawrence and Detective Larsen.<eos> We need to speak to you about Henry White.<eos> The bus driver?<eos> He was attacked last night, got beaten up pretty badly.<eos> Big Guero like that should be able to handle himself in a fight.<eos> What happened to your hand?<eos> I burnt it on a steam iron.
Oh. Fred was here.<eos> You knew about that fire, didn't you?<eos> Those men died.<eos> Yes.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Oh, what difference would that have made?<eos> The truth...<eos> About us, about our legacy?<eos> That doesn't make a difference?<eos> All my life, I was told that our family was something special, that we lifted up this town and kept it from ruin.
The young home cook with a total of two eggs,<eos> Abby, please come to the front.<eos> The next two young home cooks had a total of four perfect eggs each.<eos> Oona and Adaiah, please come down.<eos> The next two that managed to perfect five stunning Sunny-Side Up Eggs,<eos> Josh and Levi, please.<eos> With a total of seven.<eos> Logan.<eos> Me and Sean are left and the winner of this challenge is gonna get an advantage.<eos> And whatever advantage it is, I want it.
Cheap.<eos> Come on, Cruz, pony up.<eos> Every extra dollar I've got is in Molly's truck.<eos> Me too.<eos> Don't even ask.<eos> Hey, Mouch, turn it up.<eos> Severide, check it out.<eos> I saw she was down, and something inside me was screaming out,<eos> "do something, do something," you know?<eos> So I picked up the heaviest thing I could find, and I threw it through the window, and I yelled out,
-And who doesn't like that?<eos> -Yeah, exactly.<eos> Not a phrase for a first date, obviously.<eos> No, exactly. But I do like...<eos> -I thought we were...<eos> -I wasn't expecting that.<eos> ...freed from that sort of thing.<eos> "As this argument is getting boring..."<eos> -Well, not really.<eos> -I was enjoying it.
Fear not, this is something else.<eos> -What?<eos> -Well, you will have heard<eos> -of the Mille Miglia.<eos> -Yup.<eos> A thousand miles through Italy in something like a 1 952 Alfa Romeo?<eos> -That is what we're gonna do. -Really?<eos> -Well, I've had to change a few things. -What things?<eos> The distance.<eos> I've brought it down a bit.
Oh, yes!<eos> Did you see that?<eos> If he isn't who he says he is, then who is he?<eos> And what does he want?<eos> You fought well.<eos> The Gods were kind.<eos> Would you like some help with that?<eos> I'm fine - thank you.<eos> I thought perhaps you might like to remove your brace.<eos> I wear it for fortune's sake.
I had my suspicions.<eos> You tried to warn me.<eos> Why didn't I listen?<eos> Because you always think the best of people.<eos> Dion said you would be here.<eos> It can't have been easy to lose like that.<eos> Jason's a fine fighter - there is no shame in losing to such a man.<eos> I hope not.<eos> You promised me I would have your answer today.<eos> Yes, and you shall have it. You shall.
They sometimes see sort of a tunnel with a light at the end.<eos> They sometimes feel one with the universe.<eos> They sometimes see relatives who had passed away. So it's a common universal experience that happens to people who are either near or close to death, or even technically dead.<eos> NARRATOR: Some physicians believe near death experiences could be triggered by hypoxia... a lack of oxygen in the brain that can cause visions.<eos> But other researchers disagree.<eos> They point out that those who have these experiences see events occurring around them that are later confirmed to have happened.<eos> And that their perceptions are not dulled in a way that would be consistent with a dying brain. Perhaps even more significant, a recent study found that the near death experience was remarkably similar across the ancient world.<eos> JONATHAN YOUNG: Professor Gregory Shushan at Oxford University has found that in some of the great early cultures... ancient Egypt, uh,<eos> Mesopotamia, uh, Vedic India, pre Buddhist China, pre Columbian Mesoamerica... that there are similar reports of near death experience, that certain details keep cropping up, that the person in this experience encounters beings of light, even though the belief systems about death were very different in these cultures.<eos> This suggests that there might be something about the mystical experience at death that is stronger than the cultural stories that hold it.
If it goes eed, eed, eed, like his Mom's name... the problem is that the piston is too narrow.<eos> Perhaps the oil has dried or the cylinder is broken.<eos> Oh, hey...<eos> Why is your name "Making Milk"?<eos> Because my Dad made me drink milk with whiskey.<eos> - Your power hungry.<eos> - Can you tell me... what is the proper temperature for the boiler room?<eos> Oh, by the way... Your name is "Snap" because you like to snap your mustache?<eos> He likes to snap... down there.<eos> When the power breaks, will Daddy fix it or replace it?
Are you doing ok there?<eos> My stomach hurts.<eos> Are you gonna die?<eos> Hey, what is breast mouse?<eos> Pervert, pervert, I'll slap you.<eos> Oh?<eos> It's not here.<eos> You've already fixed this thing?<eos> It looked unrepairable.<eos> I can't believe you fixed it.
Come on, get in.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Go, Ton.<eos> Ton, you had the key all the time.<eos> Why didn't you unlock us?<eos> If I did, you would run away.<eos> Hey Tor, is that coin...?<eos> It's still here.<eos> Why didn't you return it?
So why don't you change, and we'll change, and then we'll go have a party on the beach. Oontz. Oontz.<eos> Oontz. Oh, my God, that was like pulling teeth.<eos> Please tell me this gets easier.<eos> It doesn't, but the good news is, you stop trying. ♪ Men. ♪<eos> Hey, Louis, look at this.<eos> We're almost done.<eos> Yes, now all we need is a flag for the top. Oh!<eos> Oh, that's an old Band-Aid.<eos> Uh, how about this?<eos> We'll take this juice box, flip it up here, and we'll put the straw in like this, and ta-da!
Fine.<eos> Patience.<eos> Where you going?<eos> The ocean.<eos> I'm hot and I got to pee.<eos> Well, be careful.<eos> He hates me.<eos> Oh, there he is.<eos> Did you put the seat down?<eos> I never put it up.
No.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Not yet!<eos> It's all right, we're all going home.<eos> All the way to Goathland in my Morris Minor, like it were the other end of the world.<eos> I had so many tunes, so many verses, but Richard Hutton's version were different, because he only sang three verses.<eos> I were that mad in those days, I thought, what's he hiding?<eos> Has he got a last verse, and he's not letting on?<eos> So, I banged on the door.<eos> And she opened it.
According to, told by a relative of Mohammed, the prophet,<eos> Mohammed, got sick one day. had been so exhausted to unable to get on in the bed for days, without a reason.<eos> And Gabriel appeared him, told to him:<eos> "A Jew has casted a spell for you.<eos> He blown onto the knots on a rope.<eos> And thrown it into the draw well named Zervan.
We should move on.<eos> The trail leads to the necropolis.<eos> A half a dozen or so made it inside.<eos> And Ariadne is with them?<eos> I do not know for sure, but we can presume so.<eos> Then why are your men idle?<eos> They will not venture inside, my lady.<eos> - What?<eos> - I will speak to them. It will do no good.<eos> You may find your death in the necropolis, or you may meet it here.
You want to know, you got to go.<eos> Okay.<eos> Peralta, thanks to your basketball mishap, the drop site has been abandoned, and Alexei Bisko's gone to ground.<eos> We told you eight days was too long for a stakeout.<eos> With all due respect, sir, it wasn't the amount of time.<eos> It's who I was stuck there with.<eos> I could easily have done it with Scully.<eos> Really?<eos> You would've applied that cream to his back?<eos> No, I would've put it on the floor and let him roll around in it.
- of the queen's ladies!<eos> Don't put yourself at risk, do you hear me?<eos> I'll be all right.<eos> I'll be all right!<eos> The letter I asked you to deliver to Mary last night, was it delivered?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> The servant I charged with delivering the letter was killed outside Mary's chambers.<eos> He never reached the queen.<eos> I see.<eos> Do you want it back, my lord?
All right.<eos> Well, meeting adjourned, huh?<eos> - Yeah, I thought it would never end.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Boy, I feel like we're stuck in a rut here.<eos> Well, if by "rut" you mean a comfortable groove between two loose, cool dudes.<eos> That's not a rut.<eos> That's just bad beat poetry.<eos> Listen, I say we shake it up a little bit.<eos> Okay. How about next Tuesday morning's 10:00 meeting, let's do it at 10:30.
Alec was one of them, eventually.<eos> Now, he needed pills to fuel his addiction.<eos> But he was a cop, so he couldn't go to any random dealer on the street.<eos> So, he went to the first one he ever knew-- you.<eos> We want to know how he got tied up with Buros.<eos> Alec was out of control, okay?<eos> His habit was up to 2,000 a week.<eos> And those were friend prices.<eos> One day, he offered me his police gun.<eos> Said it had a street value of a thousand bucks, so I took it.
- I already have it.<eos> At least you succeeded in doing something.<eos> Run.<eos> - Kill them.<eos> Come on.<eos> So, the witch is dead.<eos> No less than she deserved.<eos> She's not dead.<eos> - I thought you drained her blood?<eos> I didn't drain all of it, just what we needed.
Right, everything is now taped up, so let's see if it starts.<eos> There you go.<eos> At the campsite, I was returning with our evening meal.<eos> I hope he's hungry.<eos> Hello! Hello!<eos> Dinner is here.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Meat.<eos> Yeah, very funny A lot of it.<eos> Yeah, but we've done that joke, cos Jeremy did it in the top part of America.
It was a dried up lake bed.<eos> I see it now as a racetrack<eos> Oh, that was...!<eos> Argh!<eos> Can you remember where the road was?<eos> This was a mistake.<eos> Just get on.<eos> It's bloody dangerous, this.<eos> Bloody dangerous.<eos> I claim this land for Norfolk and name it Lotus Beach.
I'm headed to the ball pit.<eos> Same thing he said as he dove under the covers last night. Boing. ♪ Men. ♪<eos> Thanks for having us.<eos> I got to say, this is a great spot for a playdate.<eos> This view is amazing.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> You know, I used to walk by houses like this and think the people on the decks were just looking down their noses at everyone, feeling all superior.<eos> Now I know it's true.<eos> Roger sold our beach house 'cause he said we never used it.
I found out what it is.<eos> And no, Gerard, it's not God punishing me for that horrible thing I said.<eos> Derek Jeter's kind of handsome.<eos> Complimenting a Yankee?<eos> You also have a crush on a New York Knick, Ma?<eos> Carmelo a little, but that's beside the point.<eos> I have to have my gallbladder removed.<eos> I swear... first the dishwasher and now this.<eos> Why can't everything in the house work at the same time?<eos> They're gonna remove it?
You know what?<eos> - I don't need your packet.<eos> - Great.<eos> Well, now that I don't have to worry about Mr. Self-Sufficient,<eos> I can enjoy my time at the hospital.<eos> It'll be like a vacation.<eos> Great.<eos> Send me a postcard.<eos> Oh, I will.<eos> And when I get home, I'll read it to you, because you don't know how to bring in the mail.
It is beautiful. - But, sadly, it cannot kill a monkey. - Oh.<eos> Thank you, Grandma.<eos> This is perfect.<eos> Look, Sateen.<eos> Look what Grandma gave me.<eos> - Hey, Charlie.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - I thought you were supposed to be at the church picnic.<eos> - Yeah, but it ended early.<eos> The woman who made the tuna salad left it sitting out in her car all morning.
What are you going to do then?<eos> Who is she?<eos> How is she related... to your first woman?<eos> Min Jae.<eos> Why... must you make me say this?<eos> Why must you make me act so pitiful?<eos> I owe that woman a debt.<eos> I owe her a huge debt.<eos> - I just want to pay off that debt to her.<eos> - Once you pay it off...
Yeah, lovely stuff.<eos> Nice clean pan.<eos> Now what's going on over here?<eos> Here he comes.<eos> Here he comes!<eos> 'We all needs a mate...' Hiya!<eos> '..it's natural.'<eos> And it might take you a while to find the right one, but you will.<eos> And you might lose 'em, but it was good that you found them in the first place.<eos> Everyone here has had a mate and lost 'em, but life's only interesting if you shares it.
Right.<eos> First course...<eos> Cheese on toast. Lovely.<eos> Excellent.<eos> What's the second course?<eos> Erm... beans on toast... with cheese on top.<eos> And pudding?<eos> Erm... cheese and biscuits and erm... a cheesecake.<eos> I didn't make that though.<eos> I just bought it in a packet from Lidl's.
You're not a bouncer.<eos> You're the best man.<eos> Your job is the rings. That is it.<eos> I'm the best man.<eos> Yep.<eos> All stand.<eos> 'I'm worried Hannah won't come back after her maternity leave.<eos> 'I wishes she wasn't going at all, but... '..that's... that's me just thinking what's better for me, ' but you got to worry about what's best for Hannah.<eos> You know.<eos> It's like once, I found this pigeon what couldn't fly and I took it in and I looked after it and made it strong and then one day it was flapping at the window... ..cos it was wanting to go, and I was sad that it wanted to go, but I was happy that it was better.
You lost some weight?<eos> Eh, I'm trying.<eos> What is it with this song?<eos> Feels like it's on a constant loop.<eos> 'Cause it is.<eos> It's Molly's favorite.<eos> Which means it's all of our favorites.<eos> Well, at a certain point, it's no longer festive.<eos> It's-it's psychological torture.<eos> I'd turn it back on before Molly decks your balls and roasts your chestnuts.
Fan Kwok Shang!<eos> Fan Kwok Shang!<eos> Fan Kwok Shang!<eos> Stop stealing drugs.<eos> It's no use now.<eos> Don't waste your energy.<eos> I've decided to leave.<eos> You have to take your medicine.<eos> Take it!<eos> Why don't you take it?

This is KCRW it's gonna be a hot one in downtown Los Angeles.<eos> Might be a good day to slip out to the beach and cool off.<eos> That's what I want to do.<eos> For the weekend, the National Weather Service is issuing a high...<eos> - Morning.<eos> - Morning.<eos> Mom, why is Roger always swimming in your pool?<eos> Because he's a neighbor and a friend, and why shouldn't he?<eos> Maybe he should pay the pool boy.<eos> He's the only one that uses it.
! Now!<eos> Come , spend , this is your apartment.<eos> Great job , guys!<eos> I said I was strong ...<eos> I see.<eos> Now you can go home .<eos> Wait ... ?<eos> And our salary ?<eos> There you go ...<eos> Better grab your hand before they eat it.
Really?<eos> That floor in which you live ...<eos> I paid in cash.<eos> I rented fichaste the day for me.<eos> Registration tell I was still at work.<eos> Pay cash week .<eos> You know what name I rented ?<eos> When the fucking Oscar Ramirez.<eos> The box is there now.<eos> Cops find it , and think that they took the job to access key that opens .
What really aggravates you in this world?<eos> You know, like really pisses you off?<eos> I don't like it when people judge a book by it's cover.<eos> How so?<eos> When someone makes judgments about someone else... like how much money they have, or how smart they are, based on appearances only.<eos> That really sets me off.<eos> How's your head?<eos> How's your head?<eos> Still hurts.<eos> Yeah, it was bleeding before, but Billie, she bandaged it up.
I don't know my location.<eos> We need you to trace this phone call and figure out where we are.<eos> I can't do that, sir.<eos> I'll transfer you to the police department.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Hello?<eos> What's going on?<eos> There's an incoming call.<eos> Answer it.<eos> No, don't answer it.
James...<eos> I mean, what's the point?<eos> If we don't have the phone, then we can't get the codes anyway.<eos> I spoke too soon.<eos> No, it's a good thing.<eos> If this works, we've got a better chance of getting out of here.<eos> Let's say that there's been an ecological disaster for Carcharias.<eos> An offshore oil rig has failed, spilling millions of gallons of crude into the ocean.<eos> Now, there are three Carcharias owned companies that are potentially liable.<eos> The builder of the rig, the ones that operate it, and the company that owns the oil.
How are you going to do that?<eos> With this.<eos> I keep it in my home for protection.<eos> When your people came to kidnap me last night, I went for it.<eos> When I woke up, I realized that whoever had taken away my cell phone and my wallet... had somehow missed it.<eos> I decided to keep that to myself.<eos> Did you really think I didn't know about that gun?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> They found it on you when they brought you in last night.<eos> I told them to let you keep it.
Because the water's filled with arsenic and lead.<eos> It's ambler, Pennsylvania.<eos> The whole town's downstream from a Hawkstone mine.<eos> They've pumped waste into that ground for years.<eos> Just like sago, where I grew up.<eos> Get in bed and I'll read you a story.<eos> Pick one out.<eos> We put the house on the market... once we found out the water was eating away at the enamel in Taylor's teeth, but... unfortunately, no one wants to buy a house in a town with poisoned water.<eos> My husband's work gets a great deal on bottled water.<eos> We use it to brush our teeth.
Oh, well, come on in.<eos> If you're here to talk about Victor Crowley again, I told you everything I had to say yesterday.<eos> Well, actually, Abbott, that was ten years ago.<eos> What?<eos> Speak up.<eos> Yeah, I'm not here to talk about Victor Crowley.<eos> Well, then, what the hell you want?<eos> We are here on official police business.<eos> You've got a piece of evidence that is part of our investigation.<eos> We wanted to borrow it and then bring it right back to you.
This is where it gets nasty.<eos> "I didn't write sooner because, on arriving in Port Said, we had problems.<eos> A sailor had died.<eos> They thought it was plague and put us in quarantine."<eos> Plague!<eos> Imagine that.<eos> Plague on his ship!<eos> When another boy had mumps, I'd keep him at home. Now he wallows in plague.<eos> Up to his neck in it!<eos> - But he didn't catch it.
Yes, just a quick snack.<eos> I'm glad. It proves you're well.<eos> Come on.<eos> Drink, take a bit of everything. Love apples, artichokes.<eos> Go on, dig in.<eos> Tell me all about it.<eos> He's hot but he's gone off quietly.<eos> He's a bit hot.<eos> He must be cutting a big molar.<eos> I felt it with my finger.
But love is light.<eos> It takes a lot to make eleven pounds.<eos> I gave my share. She did too. But Panisse gave the most of all.<eos> What about you?<eos> What did you give?<eos> - Life.<eos> - Yes, life. Dogs give life too.<eos> No, Marius, you didn't want this child.<eos> All you cared about was your pleasure.<eos> You didn't give him life, he took it.
We had to go all the way round to the other side.<eos> - We need to leave here now. - Mrs. McEvoy:<eos> We have to wait for Nick!<eos> She told us not to touch his stuff.<eos> Her stupid son's gone to war and he's not coming back.<eos> We have to go now.<eos> It's dangerous here.<eos> Look at me. Look at me.<eos> We're gonna get through this, okay?<eos> You just gotta take that bad thing, you take it, you put it in a box, you close the lid, you look up and you focus on your goal, okay?
Yes.<eos> Hard to choose between his family and the one you love.<eos> - You chose love.<eos> - Yes, if it was there it was.<eos> Yes...<eos> I'm meeting Tord at the funeral home.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm looking a gift for a friend. Where did you get your jacket?<eos> I do not know.<eos> I have borrowed it from my colleague Sophie.
We've got four teams on overwatch, sniper-spotters in roosts north and South of the target.<eos> Just keep all your men out of sight.<eos> When they drive that truck in here, I want to come crashing down on them like the walls of Jericho.<eos> Hobbs, I just caught this one disabling the perimeter security system.<eos> Your house is compromised.<eos> What are you suggesting?<eos> I ain't suggesting.<eos> We follow protocol, we move the component out.<eos> Shaw thinks it's here.<eos> We're going to get it out of here before he arrives.
Casey, what's your favourite movie?<eos> What's your favourite movie?<eos> - What?<eos> - What's your favourite movie?<eos> Just tell me, what...?<eos> Tell me, what is it?<eos> Bridesmaids.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I love that movie.<eos> I think I saw it about a hundred times.
He was on his way there, Maddy.<eos> The trace confirmed it.<eos> - That's not what happened.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> We had a trace going and you did every single thing exactly the way you were supposed to do it.<eos> - I want you to go home.<eos> - Oh, I'm not going home.<eos> This isn't a request.<eos> You want closure. You're not gonna get it.
No.<eos> I told you you didn't wanna see it.<eos> You promise you're gonna find me?<eos> I can promise you this, sweetheart, okay age, Casey.<eos> Twenties, 30s, 40s?<eos> Thirties, I think. Like mid-30S.<eos> - Bridesmaids.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> I love that movie.<eos> I think I saw it about-
The prophecy says the warrior will manifest at mid moon, enter the circle and save the Dairen.<eos> A hero of great faith, with the power to walk through fire.<eos> It's yours.<eos> Am I to wait all night to have my bowl refilled?<eos> Do I?<eos> I used to spend hours here when I was a little girl.<eos> My father would hold me on his lap and read me stories as I turned the pages...<eos> Over here is Anyon, the first king of the Deiran's.<eos> As he stood before his victorious army and raised his sword aloft, the lightning gods filled him with power, his boots melted the stone beneath his feet.<eos> Two dragons; one poisons the land, the other heals it.
I heard that Mrs. Derain had fallen on hard times... so I persuaded her to sell it to me for... 250,000 pounds.<eos> Hmm... not exactly cheap.<eos> I thought it was a reasonable price.<eos> You were talking about eight million.<eos> This way everyone gets a good deal.<eos> How much do you want, Billy?<eos> I don't want a penny more than I gave the old girl.<eos> Now you're really losing your grip.<eos> I just want to get back to where we were... when I was your friend, your accomplice... your trusty procurer of women.<eos> If you're doing all this to win back my trust, Billy, it's been a bad deal for you, because you never lost it in the first place.
Oh, right.<eos> You charmed that out of me.<eos> - I'm Mason.<eos> So listen.<eos> That bomb still makes me nervous.<eos> I'm going to see if I can set it deeper and then barricade the tunnel.<eos> - I could get it in the furthest. I am the smallest.<eos> - No, that's not necessary.<eos> It's as deep as it's gonna get.<eos> I--I buried it in there.
- She's really upset.<eos> We're going outside to talk.<eos> - All right.<eos> Be careful.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - What is it?<eos> Stop that. What are you doing?<eos> Stop that.<eos> - The gun's not here anymore.<eos> I think someone took it.
Bring it here!<eos> Come on.<eos> - Toss it through.<eos> - Is that you, tom?<eos> Do you want that?<eos> Then you stay on this train and you do not do a damn thing!<eos> All right?<eos> - He smashed it.<eos> He smashed the radio.<eos> Why would he smash it?
Cut the crap, Bebes.<eos> I look a decade older and so do you.<eos> Said the one of us not wearing control tops.<eos> Wait until you see Muffin.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I heard she had work done.<eos> Really, like, somebody said it was scary.<eos> Well, let's just say most of her face is now behind her ears.<eos> And she's completely mental.<eos> She's driving me crazy about the details of the wedding, which is ironic because we're hosting it here.
Alejandro was the guru.<eos> He completely motivated you, you know.<eos> And I still say yes to this day I did some of my most unusual paintings and I'm very proud of them. He was very supportive.<eos> Very supportive.<eos> Alejandro motivated me to such an extent I used to go in at weekends just to finish paintings.<eos> I've got this memory of coming up with the pirate spaceship over a weekend.<eos> It's been mortally wounded and all this spice is spilling out of it.<eos> And it's got a camouflage which matches the asteroid.<eos> It was just like a fish.<eos> If it stayed very still, no one could see it.
They are not designers or artists themselves. Most of those guys are accountants.<eos> They did not conceive of that. Maybe it was a bit long as well. Maybe the film was a bit too long.<eos> They asked me to make a picture one hour and a half, for the theaters. And myself, "No, why the time?" I will make a picture of 12 hours!<eos> Or 20 hours!<eos> The worry was that it would go way over budget and it wouldn't have an audience because no one would want to sit through that long a film. So those things should have been at least talked through I think, before a presentation was made because someone should have known that the studio people would be...<eos> There would be a red ﬂag all the time about how bizarre it was.<eos> The totally outrageous side of Jodorowsky especially after The Holy Mountain and El Topo did not give them faith that he could lead this very ambitious project. Because $15 million in the middle of the '70s was a lot of money.<eos> And that was their answer, even though they found everything else to be perfect.<eos> Everything was great, except the director.<eos> The movie has to be just like I dream it.
What the fuck is going on?<eos> That son of a bitch...<eos> Who, him?<eos> This son of a bitch is my brother.<eos> What does that make me?<eos> Another son of a bitch, right?<eos> No, no.<eos> Look, we don't want any trouble. Really.<eos> The kid stole our bag. Okay?<eos> We just want it back. And we'll go.
It is good to eat when you're working.<eos> It's rolls.<eos> They dry out quickly in the sun.<eos> If you don't want to eat, tell me and I'll take it away again.<eos> I'm taking it back again.<eos> If you're hungry, let me know.<eos> Shall I leave the water bottle behind?<eos> I'll put it in the shade.<eos> I'm putting it down here.<eos> You've got to look, or you can't find it.
Mrs. Diamond.<eos> Uh, no.<eos> No, Lily.<eos> Stevie Evans... Meet Lily Diamond.<eos> There.<eos> Now it's done.<eos> "I swear that Ike Evans is innocent.<eos> Dandy Al Haas murdered Jimmy Shoes right before my eyes, and I will testify to that truth in court."<eos> It's her signed, handwritten statement.<eos> We found it on the desk in the motel after Haas was killed.
Every survivor nearby came by instinct.<eos> On the first floor there were sailors mobilized factory workers. .. ...and a few sappers.<eos> They set up in Apartment 6 where the large Kulikov family had lived.<eos> Now there was a machine gun there.<eos> The fascist bitch works.<eos> Come here.<eos> Shoot some Germans with it.<eos> I was joking.<eos> Give me your canteens.<eos> Will I get it back?
Some kind of artillery.<eos> I have a beautiful wife.<eos> I chose her from the village for her beauty.<eos> My village is far away, near Bryansk.<eos> We made a life.<eos> We were happy.<eos> I took care of her.<eos> I bought her a kerchief some felt boots.<eos> She liked me to stroke her head.<eos> I'd come home and sit by her she'd put her head on my lap and I'd stroke it.
- Man, I owe you so big.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You do.<eos> Kip, you are one seriously, seriously lucky guy.<eos> You stole an... you stole an account from hal's team?<eos> Well, you know... Little.<eos> - How?<eos> How did you do that?<eos> - Well, for starters, I didn't steal the account.<eos> They'd already lost it.
I just want you to be prepared ...<eos> - We promised each other ... that we were not officially engaged until I was back.<eos> We wanted 't risk it.<eos> But ... I think they might need. Something to hold on to it.<eos> I'm gonna ask her to marry.<eos> That's awesome, dude.<eos> Great idea.<eos> Ladiesandgentlemen,Apollo11is out the atmosphere and all systems are good. Iknowalsothe crewgood luck wishes for their historic journey to the moon.<eos> Look at that statue.<eos> I call it the stone dick.
What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> Now I'm the criminal here?<eos> It's a secret stash. You're telling me you don't have a secret stash?<eos> You're a very difficult victim, Victor.<eos> It's Money Management 101.<eos> Get a chopper, ASAP.<eos> My name is Victor Kershaw.<eos> I'm looking to close my account.<eos> And what would you like to do about the safety deposit box?<eos> Well, I'm really in a rush, but I may as well open it while I'm here, right?
What?<eos> Are you gonna stay on the bench?<eos> Yes. I'm gonna stay...<eos> I'm gonna live on this bench.<eos> Come to The Gramercy.<eos> On Saturday.<eos> Please.<eos> Just hear the song.<eos> I want you to see how everyone's just falling in love... with what you created...<eos> Please don't play it like that.
I can't offer you much protection,<eos> I only have needles that let in draft<eos> But my answer is... Yes.<eos> Overjoyed, the sparrow took refuge there and you know what?<eos> He survived the winter.<eos> The children returned and wept tears of joy.<eos> Upon seeing this, the Creator decided to punish all the other trees for their selfishness.<eos> From that day on, every tree lost it's leaves in winter, except the pine, who saved the sparrow.<eos> My grandmother told me this story.<eos> Had you ever heard it before?
Guys, you have not seen what a strange bedroom had that type.<eos> However, before we leave this place tomorrow morning, and better '.<eos> Ah ok, very funny.<eos> - Who took it?<eos> - What? Adam, you took my guitar?<eos> - What?<eos> - Give me the guitar.<eos> - Did you put behind you.<eos> - I know where I put it.<eos> - Come on, who took it?
Relax! Ouch.<eos> Who has it? Huh?<eos> Bitches.<eos> It's not 'fun.<eos> Listen, give it to me!<eos> Give it to me, man!<eos> - I do not see here, man.<eos> - Okay, where 'my guitar?<eos> - What?<eos> Just play. When you went to pee, did you hide it.
- Okay, where 'my guitar?<eos> - What?<eos> Just play. When you went to pee, did you hide it.<eos> Where 'the guitar?<eos> - Do not joke Adam!<eos> Give it to me.<eos> - I do not have. - Calm . - Give me the guitar!<eos> Stupid guitar!<eos> - Cammi , give me the torch.<eos> - Where did you put it?
Yes, something like that.<eos> That's not necessary, we can take care of ourselves.<eos> Bianca?<eos> Alright.<eos> We'll come by to visit you often to make sure everything's going well.<eos> You must know you are not alone.<eos> Shouldn't it be night already?<eos> Yes, it should be.<eos> Strange...<eos> All this light, do you see it?
But, when the oil shocks happened and the prices went up dramatically, the French realized that they needed to get serious about a different source of energy.<eos> They said this was serious and it has to do with National security.<eos> So, they focused on making sure they had the best nuclear engineers and the standard design for the reactors, and they just rolled it out.<eos> What's so significant about what the French did, is that they did it so quickly.<eos> They scaled-up almost exactly at the pace that we need to scale-up nuclear power globally.<eos> They now have 80% of their electricity coming from nuclear.<eos> The trains are electric powered.<eos> They have clean air.<eos> They have the cheapest energy in Europe.<eos> They're selling it to everybody else.
No more working, and travels for you.<eos> I am just gonna leave you two alone for a minute.<eos> ask her.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I have to ask you something.<eos> Sure. You know it's only taking me this long to propose to you because..<eos> I don't want us to end up miserable like my folks, because they constantly broke..<eos> I can still hear my mom said.. No money comes in the door, love flies out the window. I love you.<eos> -I keep telling you, it doesn't matter to me.<eos> We'll do our house up, and we'll sell it..
The fair is over.<eos> It must close down forthwith.<eos> The fair is closed due to public insolence, sedition and insubordination.<eos> Stop the music, stop dancing!<eos> Stop the music!<eos> The ringleaders are to be arrested and taken into custody.<eos> Those who resist, will be clapped in jail.<eos> - Who started the rioting? - What rioting?<eos> It was the baron.<eos> You've got a big mouth, but we'll soon close it for you.
It'll make a man out of him.<eos> Am I right?<eos> If only I knew...<eos> Knew what?<eos> How I can help him.<eos> We must get him out 0f that dungeon.<eos> Can I leave this basket with you while I visit my son?<eos> You don't mind if I put the basket down here?<eos> I won't be long.<eos> Right, I'll be putting it down here, then.
Form a single-file line, one after another.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Missile launch in T minus two minutes.<eos> One after another.<eos> Keep your hands in the straps and hold on tight.<eos> Really?<eos> You're gonna make me kill a blind chick?<eos> I'm pretty sure they're gonna take my crown for that.<eos> That's all right.<eos> They'll just give it to the next bimbo who spreads like butter.
You all right?<eos> There's all sorts of stuff here.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, nice.<eos> Why?<eos> Why?<eos> Yes!<eos> Got to do something with that.<eos> So, I, uh... So, I found this gurney.<eos> I don't know who put it here, but it's here.
♪ And that's it hanging on the shed!<eos> Hey! ♪<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> Fuck me.<eos> You mad little British bastard.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, you know...<eos> Where do you know that song from? Um...<eos> My mother had the record.<eos> We'd listen to it endlessly as kids.
And finally, I'm sure you've all noticed the fabulous chandelier you'll be delivering.<eos> What?<eos> Where?<eos> Up there.<eos> Nice.<eos> It's extremely delicate, so if one of you breaks it, you're paying for it!
Bender, you have a lovely baritone, and you sure can strum that plastic guitar, but you can't write a real folk song about experiences you haven't had.<eos> Yeah, you should write a song about a heartless robot who leaves his best friend to be murdered.<eos> Look, Leela, I'd love to write about my own experiences...<eos> The heartless robot is Bender.<eos> The best friend is me.<eos> How can you people be so blind?<eos> But I've never picked cotton or been on top of Old Smokey or worked on anything all the livelong day, let alone a railroad.<eos> Then go live among the railroad men, why not?<eos> You'll come to understand them, just as I now understand the ape-men of Earth.<eos> As stupid as Zoidberg's idea is... it's brilliant when I have it.
Nope.<eos> He's too dumb, and I don't care.<eos> Well, I'm smart, and I care too much.<eos> I want to know what's in that crate.<eos> But we're not allowed to open it!<eos> I know that!<eos> Go get me a crowbar.<eos> Please, use mine.<eos> I just need it in case, uh, Fry gets his head stuck in a pot of honey.<eos> And in the meantime, if I should happen to bump into the crate and open it... whoopsie!
But what are those aliens trying to ask us?<eos> What do the tones mean?<eos> Isn't it obvious?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Drat, I was hoping it was.<eos> Well, whatever it is, we'd better figure it out soon because that ship will reach Earth in two weeks.<eos> That's a hell of a slow ship.<eos> I know I've heard that melody before.<eos> I just can't remember where. Hmm.<eos> Perhaps we can narrow it down by seeing what part of Fry's brain becomes active when he hears it.
Well...<eos> No... It's... It's still...<eos> I know it's a bit unconventional, but, um...<eos> There's some others - like Nikola Tesla...<eos> Who has been talking to you about Tesla?<eos> Just some person who mentioned him.<eos> I do not think that Tesla is a good role model for your academic career.<eos> That is the path to madness.<eos> Do you know about confirmation bias?<eos> Where you're blind to all the things that will refute your theory and you're fixating on the things that support it?
Try and decode this one.<eos> So, Luke tells... these are parables, these little stories.<eos> Like "The Prodigal Son", that's a parable.<eos> There's one about the lost coin, a woman who was preparing for a wedding and she had to have so many coins, and she lost one. And she just tore the house up looking for that coin.<eos> Now it's called the Holy Bible.<eos> Well, Bible means book.<eos> Mom, where is the box?<eos> I left a little box here.<eos> It's a small wooden box, Mom!<eos> I haven't seen it.

I was just a little sore afterwards, but I'm usually a little sore after a big night you know, so not any different than many nights...<eos> Well who was it?<eos> I know him, it's really weird.<eos> I guess it's not weird,<eos> I guess it happens that way a lot, but really I didn't realize I was getting raped until like later when I thought about it,<eos> I was kind of disappointed I just kind of gave up halfway through.<eos> Have you ever raped anyone?<eos> Want some of that?<eos> Here you are, breakfast in bed.<eos> I didn't have any milk, I only have one serving of cereal, so I split it in two, and I didn't have coffee so you got water, so I poured it with heart so..
I got you...<eos> Hackus!<eos> Kitty, kitty, kitty.<eos> Not the cat, not the...<eos> Deeply, deeply disappointing experiments.<eos> We've got to rescue Smurfette.<eos> What's our plan to bring Smurfette home?<eos> All right, Smurfs, listen up.<eos> I saved enough grotto water from the last blue moon for just such an occasion.<eos> I was able to smurf it into smurfportation crystals.
Well, that's why they overreacted.<eos> They didn't overreact.<eos> He's dying.<eos> I think it's time for this.<eos> You didn't bring the crown.<eos> Don't put the crown on him.<eos> Come on, you used to love this crown.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> - You wore it everywhere.
Please!<eos> You won't give me the formula, so, well, I might as well just let them go.<eos> Vexy.<eos> You mean you'd let them die?<eos> I can always make others.<eos> Besides, I am not the one letting them die.<eos> You are.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll give it to you.
Enough of this!<eos> Just come out!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come out and help.<eos> I've been waiting to help. What should I do?<eos> I've got the demon's essence in his throat.<eos> Now go suck it out quickly.<eos> Okay.<eos> How do I suck it out?
All we do is open and close the case.<eos> Now, if she buys something on Amazon, then Seattle PD would investigate.<eos> Your mobile company's in Ohio, then Cleveland PD handles that.<eos> Then so on and so forth for every single theft.<eos> Well, hang on. How long does all this take?<eos> About six months to a year.<eos> A Year?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So why don't you go ahead and just leave your contact information with this gentleman here?<eos> You might want to hold on to this mug shot in case you may need it.
We just need a little code to get in there.<eos> Yeah, but we can't get in there with you looking like that.<eos> That's a great point.<eos> There is a way around that.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> What is it? What is it? My fibromyalgia.<eos> Oh, God, my leg is cramping up.<eos> What can I do? What can I do?<eos> Oh, God. Rub it.<eos> Rub it? Rub it!
All right now.<eos> Y'all fresh niggers. Y'all gonna be in a cutting gang.<eos> Very simple.<eos> I want you to take your knife.<eos> Get in them cane.<eos> Make it sing.<eos> Take the cane out.<eos> Cut my tops.<eos> Clean the shucks off.<eos> Throw it on a pile for the planting gang.
Dance, I says!<eos> Come on!<eos> Pick it up, Platt.<eos> Play that fiddle, boy.<eos> Platt.<eos> Yes, Mistress?<eos> Can you find your way to Bartholomew's?<eos> I can, ma'am.<eos> This is a list of goods and sundries.<eos> You will take it to be filled and return immediately.
Leave my papa alone.<eos> That's right, baby.<eos> Okay, lights out.<eos> Night.<eos> Oh, boy, sorry about that.<eos> So has your mother done this before?<eos> She always leave.<eos> And you don't have anybody else?<eos> What are we gonna do with you, huh?<eos> Mama, me did write you one letter, but I didn't know where to send it, so me burn it up.
This is it.<eos> You can build anything you want here.<eos> Your dream house awaits.<eos> I mean, breathe it in.<eos> You know, just.<eos> Really savor it.<eos> Let your imagination go wild.<eos> Ah, I don't want to build a fucking house.<eos> Plus, it's way too much work.<eos> You're not going to build it, all right?

I'm gonna have a shower.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, maybe we should split up.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll call you in a sec.<eos> Andie, what happened?<eos> How did she get out?<eos> How?<eos> The gate was open.<eos> Yeah, well, did you leave it open?
If I finish this marathon, I earn a medal.<eos> You're a fatso, and you couldn't run 4 blocks.<eos> - Stan.<eos> - What?<eos> ! It's true.<eos> His legs are shorter than his feet!<eos> Ugh. Roger, don't listen to him.<eos> Let your actions speak for themselves.<eos> Like when you get drunk tonight and eat all the fruit leather which you claim to hate.<eos> I do hate it!
Well, hell, Francine...<eos> I'm an archaeologist.<eos> Why do you keep leaning in when I say stuff?<eos> Roger! This is... amazing!<eos> Yeah, well, not so amazing.<eos> We haven't turned up anything yet.<eos> You... y-you did all this?<eos> Well, me and Jabari.<eos> Jabari, show Francine how you wear your shirt sometimes.<eos> That's how he wears it sometimes. Hello.
You know, I really think we need to get out of here, guys.<eos> Babe, you know as well as I do, we heard somebody in here.<eos> It could be like gang activity or anything like that here. We don't know what's here.<eos> This is a big place. I just feel that we need to get out of here.<eos> We should go.<eos> I got a little surprise for you all.<eos> Dude, what the fuck is that?<eos> It's protection. It's like insurance.<eos> Oh, jeez.<eos> Why don't you get your fucking camera out of my face before I shove it up your fucking ass, dude.
You wanted a movie.<eos> Now we got a movie, Adam.<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> And you know what, Adam?<eos> You made me the bad guy.<eos> I told you not to.<eos> Is this what you wanted?<eos> I just want to do whatever it is you want.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I want to do what you want, Adam. Now you've got a movie, and we made it together.
I want to thank him. We don't know where he is.<eos> He suffers from ptsd.<eos> We think he might have had a relapse.<eos> Gather around, guys.<eos> I want you all to meet nathan.<eos> Hi, nathan.<eos> I'm charlie.<eos> So, are you moving in with us?<eos> Looks like I might be around for a while.<eos> Well, I have an extra bed in my room if you ever need it.
From the house, where's my file box?<eos> You told me to throw everything out.<eos> All the old shit, Joy.<eos> - Fuck, you threw out my file box?<eos> - Llewyn.<eos> No cursing.<eos> Except now I gotta go back to the fucking union hall.<eos> It had my Masters Mate's and Pilot's license in it.<eos> Jesus Christ, Joy.<eos> You told me to put it out by the curb.
Supposedly, some of these people are famous.<eos> Does anyone know who they are?<eos> They're from the future, we don't know them yet.<eos> They're not from the future, they are from the present.<eos> Good thinking.<eos> Maybe you are the computer geek over there.<eos> Maybe you created the game yourself.<eos> Oh, if you're so sure, why don't you kill me right now and get the game on?<eos> Wait a second, if all these characters are different nationalities, how come we're all speaking English?<eos> I got a theory about that, but if I tell it to you I may run the risk of being killed by my friend over there on the count of being a computer geek.
Are we going to the market?<eos> We are waiting for the new ones.<eos> They come with us.<eos> You are afraid of me?<eos> I do not know.<eos> Those are the orders.<eos> You have your orders.<eos> I'm going to do what I please.<eos> One of your men did not surrender his weapons.<eos> Two nobles were killed, they stole their property... and they gave it to the peasants.
Chad, hold it. Stop.<eos> What's wrong with this picture?<eos> - What are you talking about? - Quiet.<eos> Chad, your knuckles are dragging.<eos> I'll tell you what's wrong with this picture.<eos> This picture.<eos> Everything else in this pretentious apartment is generic, soulless, like Ryan.<eos> Everything but this photograph. - One of yours, isn't it, Sara?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Ryan blew it up and framed it for you, right?
We know it is the railway.<eos> Why did you draw a map of the railway?<eos> I'm a railway enthusiast.<eos> Enthusiast?<eos> I like trains.<eos> I really like trains.<eos> You used this to communicate with Thai Resistance and their Chinese paymasters.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> How could I do that?<eos> You received information and then passed it on to them with this.
It was a nice act, yöu forgetting my name.<eos> " Mr. Man. " " The act for forgetting my name. "<eos> Early morning blabbering.<eos> Didn't even let me have coffee.<eos> Whose house is it, huh?<eos> Hello?<eos> Yes?<eos> Do yöu want something?<eos> The ladder.<eos> Sorry, I kept it inside.
Connor?<eos> Who is it?<eos> Who do you think? Open the fucking door!<eos> I know you faggots are there.<eos> Oh, crap.<eos> Open the fucking door or I'm going to kick this fucking thing down. - Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> My dad's gonna kill me if he actually does it.<eos> He's gonna kill me if he actually opens it.
Sam. Can I ask you something?<eos> What's in your bag?<eos> You've had it ever since we got in here.<eos> And you're holding on to it like your life depends on it.<eos> This... it's just a backpack.<eos> I see.<eos> Just a backpack, huh?<eos> These... These are important things to me.<eos> Like this comic book.<eos> I've read it like a hundred times already... because in comic books, anything can happen.
In these kind of psychotic disorders. But i...<eos> i'm not delusional.<eos> Did a doctor confirm anything you found out about yourself? Ryan confirmed it.<eos> Ryan.<eos> He's an emt.<eos> Ryan. I'm a doctor.<eos> What, that isn't enough?<eos> We fucking videotaped it.<eos> Where's the videotape?<eos> It's... it's at my apartment or the cops have it.
You're gonna save lives.<eos> You need to party!<eos> Take it off!<eos> Whoo!<eos> It's okay, tinker bell.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Oh, my god, where did you get this shit?<eos> Oh.<eos> God.<eos> Patient had it on him when we picked him up.
My husband forgot.<eos> He forgot?<eos> I thought he sent you flowers yesterday.<eos> No, they weren't from him.<eos> He didn't even remember.<eos> I mean, he tried.<eos> It's just the second year in a row.<eos> You are forgettable.<eos> Honey, you have to make a man remember you.<eos> I've tried to give you my assistance, but you don't want it, so get out.
- He's not one of us.<eos> - We have to take care of us right now.<eos> - But...<eos> - Drop your weapon.<eos> - Drop your gun.<eos> - Both of you, please don't.<eos> - He's here to kill us.<eos> Gonna blow your fuckin' head off!<eos> Drop your gun.<eos> I won't put it down.
Take these. ♪ Move out what are they?<eos> Are they required?<eos> They are party favors, and yes, they're mandatory.<eos> It's ecstasy.<eos> The only boring thing about it is it's legal.<eos> But don't let that bother you.<eos> I'm sure in ten years' time, you'll be arrested for it.<eos> I'd come here to escape, but the question was, how far did I wanna go?<eos> Hey. What did you do with your pill?<eos> I swallowed it. You didn't?

Your dress is fabulous. Is it Couture?<eos> Haute Couture?<eos> I, uh... the dress was designed just for Carrie.<eos> Oh! So it is.<eos> Yes.<eos> Your home is beautiful.<eos> Oh, I'm glad you think so.<eos> George says the artwork is frightening.<eos> Kick, you had Edvard Munch's "The Scream" in my bedroom.<eos> The pastel version, but we sold it when George's psychoanalyst said it might be the cause of his nightmares.
Because of the photo.<eos> Yeah, he was being toyed with.<eos> "This is happening to you, Keith Skinner, because..."<eos> Because...<eos> Oh, Charlie.<eos> The photographer's number.<eos> Worth a call.<eos> Worth a call.<eos> So, do you remember this photo?<eos> Yes, of course I remember it.
Did Detective Vinetti say anything to you?<eos> The simple fact is if this gets into the press, we lose our award sponsor.<eos> No award sponsor, no award.<eos> - You follow?<eos> - Obviously...<eos> Marcus James is very sensitive about publicity, so we'd all just like to put this behind us.<eos> A man just died.<eos> A drunken vandal's just died.<eos> Through no-one's fault but his own.<eos> I see little point mourning the end of a life already completely wasted by the person living it.
He's so good.<eos> And you're currently translating Dickens.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Bleak House.<eos> - Oh!<eos> - Bleak House.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> - Where is that gallery?<eos> - Think and Do Gallery, St Honoré.<eos> I saw it, it's fantastic.
Dropped my hospital key card somewhere. I...<eos> Do you guys know where it is?<eos> - Did you put it somewhere?<eos> - No.<eos> Listen, about tonight, I really wanted to talk to you about some things.<eos> Yeah, no.<eos> Great, we'll talk.<eos> I just need to find this damn key card.<eos> Well, did you retrace your steps?<eos> Where was the last place you used it?
You okay?<eos> How are you doing?<eos> I just have my next round of chemo in four days.<eos> I hate feeling bad all the time.<eos> I can't pollute, I give a hoot.<eos> So I made the bartering deal of the century, and I got us this pedicab.<eos> Lydia is your new tutor.<eos> I'll try to make this a painless process.<eos> Tell me about college life.<eos> I'm just not feeling it yet.
- Okay.<eos> Do me a favor and put that out in the car.<eos> Okay.<eos> Has anybody seen my green dress shirt?<eos> I wanna wear it in Detroit.<eos> - See ya, dad. Love you.<eos> - Take care of your mom, buddy.<eos> - I'll see you in a couple days.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Amber claims to have picked it up from the dry cleaner before she went on vacation, but I can't find it.
Was that the only reason?<eos> When Eve first came here,<eos> I gave her a great deal of help.<eos> I talked things through with her, showed her my collection, I even lent her photographs.<eos> I requested a credit and a modest consultancy fee.<eos> She said no, and so I asked her to return everything.<eos> But she didn't?<eos> There was one photograph missing, a very rare publicity still from early 1970.<eos> A black and white shot of Stella in a sort of fur-trimmed... bikini.<eos> Eve claimed I'd never even given it to her.
It is a fungal infection on the rye grain.<eos> It's milled into the food chain.<eos> Sustained exposure can lead to ravings and visions.<eos> Sssh, I need you to tell me how you feel.<eos> I burn, sir!<eos> My feet and my fingers are aflame!<eos> Burning sensation in the extremities.<eos> Medievals knew it as St Anthony's Fire.<eos> Reid, ergotism.<eos> The man on my slab, it doesn't account for the manner of his passing, the gastric collapse that preceded it.
- "Conclusion" means the end of something.<eos> - No, no, no, no.<eos> No.<eos> - I have a surprise for you.<eos> - A surprise?<eos> - I..<eos> I..<eos> I like surprises.<eos> - Oh, you like surprises?<eos> Well, meet me upstairs in 10 minutes, and I'll give it to you
That's where you're gonna go with this?<eos> That's where you're gonna choose to go?<eos> Really smart, David. How dare you?<eos> How dare you?<eos> - Slow down, please.<eos> - Slow down?<eos> - Yes, Jill. Can you just give me a chance?<eos> Yeah. You know what, David?<eos> You already got your chance.<eos> You got it, and every second that passes is a second that you don't get to get back.
He would just come into the room and he'd go around, and say,<eos> "I'll take that one, and that one, and that one, and that one."<eos> And then Charlie would bring the writers and directors in and then say, "I want you to do this one and that one."<eos> [synth music]<eos> That was an era of great equivalency at video stores.<eos> I think people would rent anything with a cover that interested them.<eos> It wasn't about studio, it wasn't about movie star, it wasn't about budget.<eos> When you're looking at a shelf, it's very democratic.<eos> The best cover catches your eye.<eos> One thing I do, is go to video stores whenever I'm in them, and find the movie, and I pick it out, and I put it flat so it's facing front.
Eric had more of a drive to see a shot-for-shot remake of Raiders in its entirety.<eos> I think for myself, maybe it was that idea.<eos> But I think for me it was more, "I just wanna play Indiana Jones."<eos> We worked from memory for the first three years.<eos> Video stores weren't as readily available.<eos> You just couldn't get stuff.<eos> And so you were left to your own to go back to the theater and see the film again.<eos> we bought the script that was published, we bought fan magazines.<eos> I snuck a tape recorder into the movie theater just to get sound effects, and ended up getting thrown out.<eos> And then when the film came out on laserdisc in '84 or '85 we watched it and realized we were pretty close.
When you watch a VHS tape, there's almost like a archeology Where there's history written into the physical material of the thing itself.<eos> You get to see the parts that are really beat up.<eos> You know that someone rewound that and watched it over and over.<eos> It's like the part where there's boobs or the part where the guy explodes.<eos> You know that was someone's favorite part and they couldn't get enough.<eos> That was the first, I think, anybody had the power over being able to see boobs, again and again and again and again and again.<eos> Cable had been a reality in our lives, so you could see boobs...<eos> but then they were gone.<eos> And they were just a golden memory.<eos> I had a video tape of Kentucky Fried Movie and I lent it to a friend.

And it was really great just to see who this guy- you know, what he was watching, for the past 25 years.<eos> Lawrence of Arabia is one of my favorite films.<eos> And when I go see a print of that in the theater, every scratch, every break, every place you see a splice, there's a story behind that.<eos> Something happened with that movie, something happened with that print when it was shown to an audience.<eos> And there's something about that that, to me, 'cause you know that print's had some life and some legs on it.<eos> VHS could do that.<eos> It's almost like VHS has a built-in hit counter.<eos> In that, like, you can tell how many times it's been copied by the way that it looks.<eos> And so, you knew that when you got a tape, if you were in tape trading, like, the shittier it looked and the worse it sounded, you just knew it was gonna be gold because that meant that 10 people before you<eos> had copied it, and thought that it was funny enough, or great enough, or weird enough, to make a copy and then pass it to their friends, who thought the same thing.
It's only the collector market that does.<eos> Netflix Instant is a really important step towards what the studios want.<eos> And I think what you'll eventually do is you'll have a pipe that comes into your house, and you will subscribe to whichever libraries you want.<eos> The MGM library, the Warner Brothers library, the Sony library.<eos> That's where we're headed, we're headed towards... no money on their end, in terms of physical units.<eos> I mean, I imagine it's just all gonna be on access eventually.<eos> Well technically, it already is, but people some people don't wanna admit it.<eos> [speaking Japanese]<eos> We're talking about VHS, but I only have video tapes because that's the way that I can find that movie.<eos> And if that came out in a different manner, like, if that was available on a DVD, or only on Blu-Ray, I'd watch it.
My belief?<eos> She went to find their remedy.<eos> Gentlemen, please, come this way.<eos> In the treatment you conducted with her, did she speak at all of children born unto her?<eos> She did not.<eos> Nor of the child she carries in her belly now?<eos> Mr Reid, my patients - past, present, future...<eos> I have no family of my own and as a consequence, they are doubly precious to me.<eos> Such love means I will not judge them nor demand their secrets.<eos> They come to me, arms wide for assistance and I render it without condition.
Antonius sails against the pirates plaguing Crete.<eos> Pompey yet struggles with the renegade.<eos> Sertorius in Espainia.<eos> The resources of the Senate are drained by these conflicts.<eos> We have not the men nor the coin to procure them.<eos> There is one among us who could fund endeavor from his own purse.<eos> And never feel sting of its cost.<eos> I had hoped to avoid involving the man.<eos> We would not be beholden to him any more than you, Metellus.<eos> Produce alternative, and we shall seize upon it.
[scream]<eos> Yeah, right, happy fucking birthday.<eos> I certainly remember how Jason killed Ben, my boyfriend in the movie.<eos> L'll bet it's Michael I'm thinking Michael is shaking the van.<eos> It's actually Jason. I hop out of the van.<eos> For some reason I don't want to have sex anymore.<eos> I want to find Michael.<eos> I don't think I've ever seen a killing like that where he just takes, you know, his head, one hand on top and one under his chin, and just smushes it to a pulp.<eos> Actually in the script my death is described as "Ben's head gets squished like a ripe pimple."<eos> They had made a dummy head. They had filled it with cottage cheese and a bunch of gook.
I think she would be pulled back to the lake again.<eos> Tina being fully realized as who she is made the movie work, and the fact that we could pay it off with the special effects and so forth really contributed to the success of the movie.<eos> Even if Jason's machete blade had dulled slightly at the box office, all seven films in the series remained highly-profitable ventures for Paramount.<eos> But with its fan base growing up and dream demon Freddy Krueger now taking on pop-icon status, it was time for Jason to venture out of the woods... and step into a much larger world.<eos> There were seven before, obviously, and they all took place in Crystal Lake, right?<eos> And so the first question I asked them, was, "Does it have to be in Crystal Lake?<eos> Can I take Jason out of Crystal Lake?"<eos> Rob Hedden is an infectious personality, first of all, so he's a very upbeat guy.<eos> He has tons and tons of energy.<eos> Frank Mancuso Jr. Who was producing it, I mean he was the one, he just said,
Jason has to be in the film.<eos> I think that was one of the biggest let-down for the fans.<eos> It's possible that the concept jumped the shark on some level.<eos> At the time they were trying to reinvent and figure out how to keep the franchise going, and how to keep people interested.<eos> So I respect that.<eos> I think we did something that was bold.<eos> I know there are people who are upset by that, but my response to that has always been, 'You know what?<eos> There are 7 of those movies you can rent.<eos> You can see a whole lot of Jason in the hockey mask.'<eos> You have to deliver a certain story, and that story had better be consistent with the ones that preceded it, and Jason better be consistent with what happened beforehand.
And he puts the hockey mask on, and Jason comes in and grabs him by the head.<eos> You don't see him get his head chopped off but then you see the head drop out of frame and land on the ground.<eos> He's looking at the mask and puts the mask on and there it was.<eos> That's how he was going to get it.<eos> And then a few months later, they decided to go and re-shoot that a little different, and it was when he goes upstairs, confronts Donnie,<eos> That shit ain't fuckin' right, dude<eos> Cuts his throat, pulls something aside, and there's the hockey mask.<eos> I also think the scene's quite effective.<eos> I think it's an interesting moment there.<eos> Not only when he gets the mask, he puts it on, and he goes to the mirror.

I'm sorry.<eos> Go away.<eos> You got your answer.<eos> Now go away.<eos> So we'll reinforce this with some metal from the yard.<eos> If anything happens, we'll just duck.<eos> I hope nothing happens.<eos> Guns scare the bejesus out of me.<eos> I robbed a gas station with a toy gun.<eos> Never even took it out of my pocket.
- I take that as...<eos> - A gigantic red flag.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Do you remember what it was like when we joined the E-Rep?<eos> What we were like?<eos> Young and stupid?<eos> Yeah, but we thought we could change things, really change things.<eos> Help pick the world up again, brush off the rubble, and find a way for all of us, Votan and Human, to coexist.<eos> Look around, Connor.<eos> I found it, only not with the Earth Republic.
- Stay back.<eos> Are you gonna shoot me or not?<eos> I haven't decided yet.<eos> Well, can I sit while you do?<eos> I'm not getting any younger here.<eos> How did you find me?<eos> Guard saw you.<eos> Called me at home.<eos> So, how do you like the view?<eos> Well, when you showed it to me, it seemed worth seeing.
I lost my wife.<eos> And I lost a son.<eos> - You're wearing his clothes.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Life's handed me reason enough to throw myself off this cliff.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because I'm not a coward.<eos> Because I love life enough that I'm gonna hold on to every moment, good or bad, until my higher power sees fit to take it all away from me.<eos> But then again, if somebody were to offer me a second chance, I'd take it in a shot, and I don't care what kind of vessel they put me in.
- Hi!<eos> - Hi!<eos> - I spoke to Henrik yesterday, and...<eos> - Yes, I know.<eos> - I see. So I guess he called you...?<eos> - Yes, we've talked.<eos> I was just wondering if you wanted to meet up, the three of us...<eos> Well, yes... what's it about?<eos> I'd like to show you my film and hear your opinions...<eos> But if you've already made the film, why meet us now, rather than before when you were starting on it?
You know, her pimp calls her... calls her lowrider because, you know, you pull the strings on her panties, her ass starts like bouncing up and down like it's on hydraulics, you know?<eos> The movie ends with nine hookers hauling ass down sunset boulevard in full heels.<eos> You know, it's called sunset bust.<eos> So Briggs did the craziest thing.<eos> They're not buying any of this, dude.<eos> Like none of it.<eos> Tell him what you did.<eos> May I show you something?<eos> Easy.<eos> Well, basically, I know we're screwed if they search us, so I pull out my badge and toss it on the bed.
Just do what he says, all right?<eos> Do it now!<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Just put your hands up, okay?<eos> Just do what he says.<eos> What?<eos> How did you...<eos> Mike just cut transmission.<eos> - You saw the gun?<eos> - Yeah, I see it right there.
♪ She was<eos> ♪ She was as beautiful as rainbows in the sky<eos> ♪ She was so beautiful and not at all am I ♪<eos> When I was 14, my very best friend in the world was riding his bicycle and he accidently crashed into this girl I liked.<eos> Her name was Tatiana.<eos> We went to school together, though we hadn't ever talked.<eos> But I liked her from afar.<eos> Anyway, my best friend accidently crashed into her.<eos> She got banged up, got a black eye, crying, the whole thing.<eos> I went over to my friend, took the bike from him, lifted it up and smashed it over his head.
Her. I saw her today, in the parking lot at the port.<eos> And here I thought she was just a housewife.<eos> She's still a housewife, mother of three.<eos> Don't.<eos> Don't what?<eos> She's not your new cause, James.<eos> Don't let your savior complex keep you from doing your job.<eos> Saving people is my job.<eos> She was at that port for a reason.<eos> And we'll find it and use her for everything she's worth, but she's not the prize.
- Go, go, go.<eos> Darren.<eos> Darren, says nobody needs to get hurt.<eos> Police.<eos> Put the gun down now.<eos> Or what?<eos> You'll shoot us?<eos> Put the gun down on the floor.<eos> Oh, I don't think so.<eos> I'm taking it with me.
- You're a fucking prick.<eos> - Alright.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> That's what you are. You're the guy nobody likes.<eos> You're the guy in the band that's always complaining.<eos> See, we're in a band, right?<eos> Like a musical band.<eos> Can you imagine that?<eos> And when somebody in the band writes a song, like it or hate it, we fucking sing it.
And let's face it, my breasts are my prizewinners.<eos> You almost made it out, but you didn't.<eos> Let's face it.<eos> You're also the girl who makes Brody turn the lights off when you're cuddling.<eos> You have a beautiful body, but are you really ready to expose yourself to the world?<eos> That what all great artists do.<eos> They expose themselves.<eos> Expose their souls, not their flesh.<eos> But it's all part of the same package.<eos> A-Am I really expected to be able to bare my soul if I'm ashamed of the body that holds it?
Here goes.<eos> Well, well, well, if it isn't underage, smut-peddling, non-teacher Finn Hudson.<eos> Not satisfied with making a mockery of the American education system by your mere presence at this school, you have besmirched the dignity of such everyday heroes as this woman with Crohn's disease... whose name I do not know... by bringing the dark specter of pornography to these hallowed halls.<eos> Well, Crohnsey and I are here to tell you, this will not stand.<eos> Sue Sylvester, you can suck a hot one because you are a hypocrite.<eos> I beg your pardon!<eos> I seem to recall a rumour about a certain cheerleading coach at this school who once took horse estrogen and posed for "Penthouse", back in the day.<eos> So maybe I can just track that down, make a few copies and sell those to raise money for Regionals.<eos> That's nothing but a rumour.<eos> But if that rumour were true, my "Penthouse" centrefold, so groundbreaking that it completely redefined the term "hirsute", and gave birth unto these United States a pose so limber, they named it The Regal American Not-So-Bald Spread-Eagle.
What if it wasn't even a gun?<eos> You ever think about that?<eos> Cops didn't find one.<eos> It could just as easily have been firecrackers, or a car backfiring.<eos> I grew up on a farm, and I know what a gunshot sounds like.<eos> Somebody fired a gun in this school.<eos> And quite frankly, I don't feel safe knowing there's some kid with a gun stuffed in his backpack walking around these halls.<eos> No.<eos> Either the kid took the gun home, in which case, they won't be able to bring it back because of the new metal detectors.<eos> Or the kid stashed it somewhere here at school.

I'm going to change things around here.<eos> Around where?<eos> Around school, the entire school system.<eos> I'm gonna get algebra removed from the school curriculum.<eos> Well, unless you're going to make that to happen by Monday, I suggest you get on over to Kathy's and get some help with that midterm.<eos> What's the worst that can happen if I just fail algebra?<eos> I mean, I should fail, otherwise there's no point to my efforts to get algebra removed from schools.<eos> Ethan,<eos> I... I agree with you in that requiring all students to take algebra could possibly keep a student who's bad at algebra from succeeding in school overall.<eos> And even though algebra is used by accountants, financial planners, engineers, physicists, and a lot of occupations, not everyone does get algebra and not everyone uses it in their adult life.
You love darts.<eos> Yeah, but darts are a thing of the past.<eos> I'm a dad now, so...<eos> Or we could think.<eos> See this ass?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right, we're gonna hit some ink shops, and we're gonna find out whose work this is.<eos> Or... yeah.<eos> We could do that.<eos> Why would anyone have a bike and leave it locked up outside a store for a month?
Oh, y... yeah, but then... this guy comes over, and he gets up in my face, and next thing I know, he... he rips my TV out of the wall, and he throw it out the window.<eos> - Are you going to arrest him?<eos> - Yes, he will be dealt with.<eos> I promise.<eos> All right, how about your meds?<eos> You take those today?<eos> - No. Forgot.<eos> - Okay, let's do that right now.<eos> That blanket's nice. Is that new?<eos> Yeah, I bought it at a yard sale. 50 cents.
For and Against at each other's throats.<eos> How on earth did the damn Quakers find their way in here?<eos> You are a brave man, negotiating these quarters on the eve of yourjudgment.<eos> Finally you are to speak.<eos> If England is destroyed, we shall blame you.<eos> ...religion not being the only guardian of our morality.<eos> Of course not.<eos> There is self-responsibility.<eos> And failing that, does the law not have a duty?<eos> Does the Bench and Parliament not have a duty to uphold and create the laws that progress our morality not retard it?
And failing that, does the law not have a duty?<eos> Does the Bench and Parliament not have a duty to uphold and create the laws that progress our morality not retard it?<eos> If not to protect us from others then to protect us from ourselves.<eos> Laws that allow us to diminish the humanity of anybody are not laws.<eos> They are frameworks for crime.<eos> I do not care if you, as an individual, are without character or conscience.<eos> But a land whose laws sanction, not control the barbarous among its citizens, that is a country whose hope is lost.<eos> Why does it matter to you so much?<eos> M'lord... I have seen your notes!<eos> If they had wanted water, they could have had it.
Coming up.<eos> Glad to see ya.<eos> What's wrong, honey?<eos> What?<eos> No... in the yard in Brooklyn.<eos> I was dreamin' about...<eos> Try not to think about it or you won't get a wink of sleep.<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> If the story I'm going to tell you didn't happen to me, I'd never be able to make it up.
I don't know where he came up with the idea, but he's pretty set on it.<eos> The boss thinks it's a good idea, help you guys make friends in the neighborhood.<eos> "Friends"?<eos> No swearing, please.<eos> So good.<eos> If anybody would have told me I'd be living in the land of cream...<eos> Last night, at the restaurant I ate in, there was cream in the soup, the veal and the apple pie.<eos> God, not to mention the butter.<eos> Mamma mia, the butter is even worse.<eos> They put it in everything.
"Integrated," "discreet," "nondescript."<eos> What the hell are you gonna be doing at a debate on American movie classics anyway?<eos> - The subject just... as a writer...<eos> - You're not a writer, Fred.<eos> You even said I had a style all my own.<eos> You're just a mean son of a bitch who managed to save his own ass.<eos> Stan, I saved my own ass because I don't wanna fucking live like a zombie the rest of my life.<eos> I paid big time for that right, Stan.<eos> The right to live decent, physically, mentally, intellectually.<eos> So I'm gonna get a copy of that movie, I'm gonna watch it, and I'm gonna think of some interesting stuff to say, and you're gonna come with me to that debate.
She stole your keys, didn't she?<eos> Yes, she did.<eos> Do you know where I can find her?<eos> She's probably at O'Flanagan's. It's a bar down the street.<eos> It's a little divey.<eos> You might want to wear a vest.<eos> Sir, is this place open?<eos> Is there a door... Oh.<eos> So there is.<eos> Could you point it out to me with your finger?
Is that good?<eos> Can we go?<eos> No, I think it's getting worse.<eos> My fear is I'm gonna put you in a bikini and you'll still look like a fucking bank teller.<eos> Do you have to use that language?<eos> I'm trying to make a point!<eos> I'm saying your face and whatever is underneath this shitty outfit is maybe not terrible.<eos> I'll have you know I dress appropriately.<eos> I got it!<eos> It's when this your big flapping mouth, starts running, and then you put this getup on top of it, and it's just... it's a boner killer.
Nice knowing you.<eos> Yeah, thank you.<eos> Yep, that's Sal Natale, all right.<eos> Bullet hole through the head.<eos> That's unusually civilized for them.<eos> Oh, they cut out his tongue, too. Ah.<eos> There you have it.<eos> They like to send a message.<eos> Did you find the tongue? Sure.<eos> Shoved it up his anal cavity.
My name is Detective Mullins.<eos> You'd better lay your ass down.<eos> I smell bacon. I smell bacon.<eos> I smell bacon.<eos> Biscuits are done!<eos> Let's do it again!<eos> No!<eos> Stop playing this song!<eos> Why?<eos> Because you played it 26 fucking times.
I'm all in.<eos> Hey, how's it going?<eos> Jesus, you've got to get a mint in that dumpster.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Was I smoking cigarettes last night?<eos> Yeah, you kept taking them out of people's mouths and smoking them.<eos> God, that's so nasty!<eos> It was pretty gross.<eos> Why is my jacket in the pot? Don't worry.<eos> I'll get it right back.
There was nothing wrong with this place.<eos> She went out to study" ...but, started working in a club instead.<eos> At first I thought, it's a good thing.<eos> At least she's sending some money.<eos> Later, she stopped sending money as well.<eos> She must have eloped with someone.<eos> You must be earning well.<eos> Look at this hand.<eos> I used to feed her with it.<eos> And she left it.
The war between the states.<eos> That's what abner beech called it.
I raped a mother, too... with her baby screaming beside us.<eos> It just wouldn't stop... so I grabbed it by the leg and dropped it into a boiling pot.<eos> No wonder you're not touring bomb sites.<eos> It's karma for all the people you wanted bombed.<eos> It was just an incendiary bomb.<eos> Aren't you vilified for showing your legs?<eos> Everyone's got bigger worries.<eos> Is your place okay?<eos> It'll make a good target.<eos> A little bomber will hit the bull's eye and turn it into rubble.
You know all this, right?<eos> Then came jellyfish, fish, lizards, amoebas, all with the same thought:<eos> move forward whatever the cost and eat everything in their path.<eos> That's why they developed teeth so they could dodge bigger animals and chase after the smaller ones.<eos> This is healthy, remember that.<eos> But then something happened, and it all went to shit.<eos> Humans appeared on earth.<eos> Humans appeared on earth.<eos> Humans are the only animals that live in the future.<eos> I won't eat this meat today, I'll eat it tomorrow.
Director!<eos> Director, any wisdom to share?<eos> Let's see...<eos> Look at the top of the hill and speak to it.<eos> As Mitsuko's boyfriend...<eos> I realized that only he could make me into a star!<eos> I knew it had to be him so I left the set, Dad.<eos> I was selfish but I hope you understand.<eos> Let's make a good movie.<eos> We'll screen it to welcome Mom back!
That was the plan.<eos> We were going to send the boy forward into time.<eos> How far have you come with the tapes?<eos> We have the rocks from the mine in Pennsylvania, the magnet, the Observer beacons, and some scrolls of physics that none of us can decipher.<eos> Don't worry. I can help you with that.<eos> These things we've collected, how they can possibly be used to travel through time?<eos> They are part of a device that we must build.<eos> I have the hologram blueprints.<eos> It also requires technology that hasn't been invented, from my time.<eos> How do we get it?
He still helped them.<eos> Do you have any idea how lonely it feels?<eos> Having this discussion without him to back me up.<eos> If you want to know what loneliness feels like, ask his wife.<eos> And she could have done with some of that money.<eos> Were you having an affair with him?<eos> No.<eos> Do you have any idea who his clients were?<eos> He kept an appointment book.<eos> I never saw it, never knew their names.
And she could have done with some of that money.<eos> Were you having an affair with him?<eos> No.<eos> Do you have any idea who his clients were?<eos> He kept an appointment book.<eos> I never saw it, never knew their names.<eos> Why would you? They weren't important.<eos> They were only subjects.<eos> That appointment book wasn't in Reuben's office.<eos> Maybe he kept it at his flat. Take a look.
We've been investigating a murder where, to all intents and purposes, the victim's been put to sleep.<eos> Our pathologist says it has all the hallmarks of euthanasia.<eos> Most murder is unplanned and violent.<eos> This was planned and pain-free.<eos> Sedated with barbiturate, murdered with Etorphine.<eos> That's a bit over the top.<eos> A single drop can kill a man within seconds.<eos> Are you familiar with the drug?<eos> My wife and I used to work as conservationists in Angola.<eos> We often used it to anaesthetise large animals.
It's all perfectly legal nonsense! I told you.<eos> I'm out of the game for good.<eos> I've heard that before.<eos> I'm out of the game for good.<eos> I even found a great place to live. Oh.<eos> Do you have any roommates? Just one.<eos> He's been here ten years, and he said he's staying for life.<eos> I'm out of the game for good.<eos> You're in jail, aren't you? No, no.<eos> In Mexico, they call it cárcel.
Oh, I'm real.<eos> I'm quite real.<eos> Can you prove it?<eos> Yes, I can prove it.<eos> See, I have a mother and a father, and, um, that's not really... Uh...<eos> Oh, you know when you look into a mirror, and you see your... or that could be your reflection refle...<eos> Um... Rene Descartes, philosopher.<eos> He said, "I think, therefore I am,"<eos> which... is not conclusive.<eos> But, yeah, if I bit into a hamburger and tasted it, but is... anything real if I'm not?
You need to learn to forgive yourself.<eos> I did. Wanna know how?<eos> You spent a week in a mental institution.<eos> - Four days was not a week, and I escaped...<eos> - Escaped in a laundry bin.<eos> To film that pantyhose commercial.<eos> What is up with you two?<eos> You are eating tiny jams with your tiny jam spoon, and Max is violently grating cheddar.<eos> Your mother unleashed a wellspring of emotion in me, and I have nowhere else to put it.<eos> So I'm putting it in this cheese.
Where is she?<eos> She kept coming back!<eos> She kept...<eos> Grace had Joe, so she was here to help, but she kept on.<eos> I said no after that first time.<eos> I said no every time.<eos> But she wouldn't stop.<eos> And then one night.<eos> "Put your hand here," she said. "Feel," she said.<eos> She took my hand and she put it on her belly.
He needs to toughen up.<eos> You're the one who keeps talking about bullies at school.<eos> Here, hon.<eos> You have a good day today.<eos> Hey, mom?<eos> Yes?<eos> Can I have a hundred dollars?<eos> I need more paint.<eos> Oh, what about your allowance?<eos> I spent it on acrylics, but I need oils.
You can not go to sleep.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> How did you get here?<eos> I play here.<eos> Brought me here is my big brother.<eos> Do not you cold?<eos> No.<eos> How to get out of here?<eos> You need a key.<eos> Do you not have it?
Why are you here?<eos> How did you get here?<eos> I play here.<eos> Brought me here is my big brother.<eos> Do not you cold?<eos> No.<eos> How to get out of here?<eos> You need a key.<eos> Do you not have it?<eos> Lucy said, you have it.
Make an appointment.<eos> My next opening is late next month.<eos> There's no way to... speed things up?<eos> Come back tomorrow.<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> Take advantage of your vacation to eat well, benti.<eos> She's not on vacation.<eos> She was deported.<eos> Her birth certificate vanished from my papers.<eos> I assume you took it for a visa request.
Without a permanent post, I'm stuck here.<eos> You'll find an idea.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> God doesn't want me to go back.<eos> I'm a bad person there.<eos> Maybe you'll like it here.<eos> It's your country.<eos> I'll never get used to it.<eos> Tarek gave you my application?<eos> I gave it to my dad.
What did she say?<eos> Not much.<eos> But she thinks it's impossible to convince papa.<eos> Anyway, you'll be arriving the day after tomorrow, right?<eos> Vani! - Akash, mum is calling.<eos> We'll talk later.<eos> Bye.<eos> Come here, sister.<eos> Apply henna with me.<eos> I'll apply it when sister comes.
I'm the lieutenant's new assistant.<eos> Oh, okay, great.<eos> So assist him and let him speak with me.<eos> Not until you tell me what it's regarding.<eos> Fine!<eos> A TV crew is about to interview people who have seen a live triceratops for a special report on the news tonight.<eos> Now can I speak with him?<eos> I'll be sure he gets your message.<eos> That thing is so big,<eos> I'm surprised no one's found it yet.
It's the symbol for the fine structure constant of the universe, and that right there is bad news.<eos> Why?<eos> [Evan]: This place belongs to Howard Kanan.<eos> Guy's a legend.<eos> Key patents in mobile communications, medical imaging, remote oil-field sensing...<eos> Every arena he worked in, he was brilliant.<eos> Certifiable genius.<eos> Genius?<eos> Like he could understand how that thing works?<eos> We've got to find that creature and get it out of here before Kanan sees it.
Nevertheless, if you want my half, it's going to cost you.<eos> Good, fine-- what's the price?<eos> Oh, no, no, I'm not interested in chump change, Mr. Nielsen.<eos> No, no, I have got my eye on a far greater prize.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Dan Seavey was one of the most successful pirates of his time.<eos> His unrecovered fortune would be worth, whew, tens of millions today.<eos> But, you see, I need your half of the puzzle box to get it.<eos> - We don't have the puzzle box.<eos> - I don't have it.
The death of Kaldur'ahm is a non-starter.<eos> Fine.<eos> If the minnow's under the size limit, I'll go fish for the whale.<eos> Deathstroke.<eos> I see you didn't waste any time hiring my replacement, "old friend".<eos> - Fortune favors the prepared.<eos> - You don't say...<eos> Don't give me that look, little girl.<eos> Honor demanded I make the request!<eos> They denied it.
I'm a reporter for The Word, a paper down in Los Angeles.<eos> A reporter. How can I help you?<eos> Oh, we're interested in your house.<eos> A newspaper's interested in my house?<eos> Actually, in its history.<eos> Uh, well, I don't know how much I can help you.<eos> Uh, the house is about 90 years old.<eos> I don't know a lot more than that.<eos> Well, actually, we're interested in the occupants from about 25 years ago, late 1980s.<eos> Um, well, I bought it from a couple named Daniels.
I don't know a lot more than that.<eos> Well, actually, we're interested in the occupants from about 25 years ago, late 1980s.<eos> Um, well, I bought it from a couple named Daniels.<eos> No, uh, Danners.<eos> And before that, I believe the county owned it for a while.<eos> Moon Hill.<eos> That's pretty.<eos> Now, that, I can take credit for.<eos> I named the house.<eos> Uh, when I bought it, I thought it deserved a name.
And soon it's too late.<eos> The nights are getting colder.<eos> - Would you like some coffee?<eos> - No thanks.<eos> I just wanted to stop by.<eos> I went the little fast yesterday.<eos> Yes, I thought you would have some time alone with Gerlof.<eos> It was with the sandal.<eos> I see.<eos> I have sent it to the lab.
Do not call a taxi for me?<eos> It gets expensive.<eos> At this time - This jacket is from Borgholm.<eos> But if you like, you can...<eos> You may sleep here.<eos> LOCK THE DOOR AND ADD THE KEY IN MAT<eos> - Hello?<eos> - It is Gerlof Davidsson.<eos> I've got a little boy sandal by mail.<eos> And I think it is you who sent it.
Not a damn thing.<eos> And then I buried them Here at lime plain?<eos> No, we waited until the next day.<eos> For night.<eos> We buried them at the Western Wall on Marnas cemetery.<eos> It was horrible.<eos> It took us all night.<eos> It may not be visible the next day.<eos> And the sandal?<eos> I do not know why Martin kept it.
Well, I'm good with blaming Lexi for that, too.<eos> Yeah, good.<eos> Voila?<eos> Coffee- two sugars, milk, and an ice cube.<eos> Perfect, thanks.<eos> So, I was just looking at this scene again with the drugs.<eos> I thought it might be able to explain anything we saw at that party last night.<eos> And?<eos> I think it's just another case of fans trying to make the show real.<eos> Billy's got a drug, they're just gonna recreate it.
I just can't.<eos> I told you what you had to do.<eos> Pretty simple.<eos> Simple as pie, right?<eos> Stop it!<eos> "We're going on holiday to Ajaccio tonight."<eos> "Who's talking?"<eos> We spoke on the phone 'bout a year ago.<eos> I remember your voice.<eos> When I heard it, I knew you'd show up.
Find her one morning in the kitchen, y'know?<eos> Phone in her hand, drooling on the floor, eyes rolled back.<eos> I'd be sad, 'cause I love her.<eos> But she wouldn't end up in a home.<eos> And I'd sell.<eos> I made apple pie.<eos> What?<eos> I made... apple pie.<eos> She had a nice calf.<eos> We're calling it Bitch Ass.
When was the last time you saw him?<eos> Three nights ago.<eos> Ken got a promotion to managing director,<eos> - and we went for drinks.<eos> - Just drinks?<eos> Well, until Ken decided he wanted to get crazy.<eos> He went looking for some blow and came back a few minutes later.<eos> With?<eos> All right, look, I just want to make it clear that I had nothing to do with buying the stuff,<eos> - and I didn't take it either.
Welcome home.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I thought I'd come visit you at home in private so you don't get in trouble again at work.<eos> Sit down, relax.<eos> I'm making dinner.<eos> My famous lasagne.<eos> How'd you get in?<eos> How'd you get my address?<eos> I asked the super to let me in for a surprise.<eos> And besides, you gave it to me, silly.
Listen.<eos> I don't hear anything.<eos> Yeah, that's the point.<eos> Dead air.<eos> Could Sukar hook up this gizmo of yours to the radio equipment in the arch?<eos> - And boost the signal?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> There's already a powerful transmitter.<eos> And the arch makes a fine antenna.<eos> If Sukar is sending a signal into space, he must think that there is something there to receive it.
Pål!<eos> - What the hell is this?<eos> - Time Fest. All the day's celebration.<eos> - Shit.<eos> - Pour.<eos> Turn off the music.<eos> Okay, everybody!<eos> Listen here.<eos> This is my best friend Pål.<eos> Tell any song throughout fucking world and he can play it.
Put away that damn phone.<eos> - You have to take this seriously.<eos> - I'll do it! - What are you doing here, then?<eos> Do you want this?<eos> - But yes!<eos> That's it.<eos> No, I was not talking to him.<eos> He texted that he already pulled.<eos> - Have Johnny's bag?<eos> - Yes, he forgot it.
(Mary) But that one place, with-- every room had big windows in it.<eos> But this is where they said that we could bring the fence down here-- and if people could come out this door and in and out this door you wouldn't have to ever worry about who's coming in and out.<eos> - Right, just bring it out to like...<eos> - There'll be no gate out here.<eos> - We'll put the fence like here.<eos> - Oh no, a lock-gate out here.<eos> - We'll put a 6-foot fence there in order for them to see over that, they'd have to go way up in the air, so.<eos> - And this like a little--<eos> - And put the gate there but then this--<eos> - Oh no I wouldn't bring it up to there.
Somebody gets to mess with this stuff all day long?<eos> Check this dick hole out, man.<eos> Numb nuts with the nipple ring here's Ted Josephs.<eos> He's the cat that lives here.<eos> But this bitch -- oh, my God!<eos> Yeah.<eos> You remember her, right? !<eos> That little actress from that movie with the dude with the hatchet hand.<eos> That shit was dope!<eos> I didn't see it.
He's the cat that lives here.<eos> But this bitch -- oh, my God!<eos> Yeah.<eos> You remember her, right? !<eos> That little actress from that movie with the dude with the hatchet hand.<eos> That shit was dope!<eos> I didn't see it.<eos> That's good.<eos> Dude, you're missing out.<eos> I'll loan it to you.
I've seen you before your coffee.<eos> Who found him?<eos> Ah, well, a jogger did.<eos> Looks like he was strangled. Did you do a work-up?<eos> Uh, no work-up.<eos> But I spoke to some of the other transients around here.<eos> No one's seen anything.<eos> How about I.D.?<eos> No wallet, but found this card lying right next to him.<eos> He was probably holding it in his hand.
My old F.T.O., and a raging drunk.<eos> Worried he might eat his gun.<eos> Hey, so you just set up your own rehab facility in your house?<eos> He look like the kind of guy who's gonna check himself into county?<eos> You don't worry about it, all right?<eos> This is on me.<eos> "Tell chick baby you're sorry"?<eos> What the hell, man?<eos> The situation with Tammi is finally going away, and you go and pull this shit?<eos> What if somebody videos it?
What the hell, man?<eos> The situation with Tammi is finally going away, and you go and pull this shit?<eos> What if somebody videos it?<eos> What if it ends up on YouTube?<eos> You really want Tammi to look like the stable one?<eos> Nate's teacher said he's biting kids in class, lying about it.<eos> So what? So you go and do this?<eos> Kids bite at that age.<eos> He's always a good kid. I thought --<eos> You know, it's like the situation with Tammi is harder on him than I thought, and I thought I was managing it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> Gun! Gun!<eos> Not her!<eos> Not her!<eos> It's all right.<eos> Kid.<eos> Ohh! Don't tell me you're that stupid.<eos> Don't tell me that you're hiding a gun in your kid's car seat.<eos> Are you that stupid?<eos> Where was I supposed to put it?
Rae, these sessions are meant to be a time when you can open up, discuss with someone, confidentially, how you're really feeling.<eos> I told you.<eos> It was all right.<eos> Tell me how you're feeling right now, but be honest.<eos> OK.<eos> I'll tell you how I feel, yeah?<eos> Two weeks ago, my wife kicked me out.<eos> I've been stopping on my brother's couch ever since.<eos> This morning, I wake up, and there's no milk.<eos> I bought that fucking milk, and he used it to drown his Sugar Puffs in.
How can eight of 'em be an orgasm?<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> It's pound for pound.<eos> It has the same physical impact.<eos> I read it in a textbook, all right?<eos> So, just drop it.<eos> Prove it.<eos> All right, I will do.<eos> Go on.<eos> No, rack up a line of that pepper and see if you can snort it.
There you are, Finn. Nice one, mate!<eos> Raemundo.<eos> What's up with you?<eos> You all right?<eos> No, I've...<eos> I've got a tummy ache.<eos> Oh, damn.<eos> Better be OK for tomorrow.<eos> Like the shirt?<eos> Why don't you try it on? I dunno.
Nice to see you.<eos> 'So what if my mum was starting a new life?<eos> 'So what if Chloe and Finn were lost to me?<eos> 'No matter what happened, I'd always have the rest of the gang.<eos> 'And I'd always have my diary.'<eos> Excuse me, I left a little blue bag in here when I was here this morning.<eos> - Denim bag? - Yeah.<eos> Um, well, can I have it back, please?<eos> It's got, like, really important documents in it.<eos> I gave it to one of your friends as they left.
I've completely forgotten her.<eos> - Who?<eos> My girlfriend Priyanka.<eos> - Yes. I can see that.<eos> You still call her your girlfriend.<eos> By the way, what are your plans for tonight?<eos> What?<eos> Nothing, free.<eos> Me and my friends are going for a rave party.<eos> I've heard the Russian Mafia's organized it.
Are you a weather girl?<eos> I'm a lawyer.<eos> - Ooh. - A girl lawyer?<eos> Wow! That sounds like a TV show.<eos> We gotta shake up this case.<eos> Bring in girl lawyer.<eos> Yeah, baby!<eos> It's like "Matlock" with knockers.<eos> Hey. So we really love this house.<eos> Do you know who's selling it?
Yeah. (Exhales deeply) What am I gonna do?<eos> Okay, I'm flattered that I'm your go-to guy for off-the-book advice, but do you realize you completely screwed us on a key piece of evidence?<eos> So much for a sympathetic ear.<eos> Megan, she went to the guy's room, took the shirt without a warrant.<eos> It's completely inadmissible.<eos> So she wasn't thinking clearly.<eos> Her job is to think clearly.<eos> Look, she should've come to us first.<eos> This is a piece of evidence we could've nailed this guy with, and now it's off the table.<eos> What if I just put it back?
Her job is to think clearly.<eos> Look, she should've come to us first.<eos> This is a piece of evidence we could've nailed this guy with, and now it's off the table.<eos> What if I just put it back?<eos> What?<eos> What if I put the shirt back?<eos> It's not a bad idea.<eos> I get a warrant.<eos> I call it in right now.<eos> Meanwhile, you go back to your room, you put the shirt back exactly where you found it, then you leave.
No.<eos> But this is.<eos> Tamsin?<eos> - What was that?<eos> - Bad reception.<eos> Tamsin?<eos> Dammit...<eos> Hi. You're home.<eos> Yeah, what's left of me.<eos> I feel like I left my head under the boulder that crushed it.
No one even really guarded the stuff.<eos> They were lazy.<eos> Why, Antonio?<eos> Why steal from my father?<eos> Your father took over all the land around our area, including our farms.<eos> With the help of a corrupt judge, he stole all the land from under everyone.<eos> Then he forced them to grow drugs instead of food.<eos> Then the police eventually raided the farms, who had no control over what the tenants were doing.<eos> Instead of the humiliation of prison, my father hung himself in our barn.<eos> Of course, it's up to us now. To take care of my mother and sisters, but the army took the property away, said we lost it when we used it for drugs, so...
Just... Smells of sort of murder-suicide, doesn't it?<eos> It does.<eos> But you're gonna have to drag little miss fortune teller over there to the gun, you have shown a lot of determination in the past.<eos> In fact... Let me help you.<eos> Little Anika, she told me about another one of your issues.<eos> Now, this could be stronger than you're used to, but maybe not.<eos> Either way, it's going to help take the edge off what you gotta do.<eos> You know,<eos> I thought about just killing you, but I kind of did that already, in New York, didn't I?<eos> I mean, what could be worse than leaving you to live your life the way you're living it now?
How do you know...<eos> Why else would he call, sir?<eos> This is a show he's putting on.<eos> Now, if you'll take your hand away, I will indulge him. [Music pounding]<eos> This is Dorn.<eos> I've wanted for quite some time to talk to you.<eos> You might have called my office.<eos> I'm in the telephone book.<eos> I needed to really get your attention first.<eos> Then you have it... fully.
It's about as anonymous a name as you could use...<eos> - But in America.<eos> - Yeah, Britain, too.<eos> Yeah, but they have CCTV cameras here.<eos> I think I've got him!<eos> Do you have him?<eos> Sending now.<eos> Got you.<eos> Get that face to every cop in Europe.<eos> I want it on P.D.A.'s, cell phones, any device anyone might have.
Everyone says I'm the lucky one.<eos> This is our physics teacher, Mr. Ellin.<eos> He told us about Isaac Newton... the biggest problem solver of all time.<eos> Lots of people think science is boring.<eos> But I don't.<eos> Science is about asking questions and solving problems. Just like Isaac Newton.<eos> The most exciting change in my life was when I got my first real job.<eos> I was so happy when I landed a spot... at Eagle Africa, 91.3.<eos> These days, radio is the biggest thing in Sierra Leone.<eos> Almost everyone listens to it.
Wh...<eos> Did you hurt Theresa?<eos> God, no.<eos> You've known me your entire life.<eos> Is that the kind of man you think I am?<eos> I just need to hear it from you, and I... I just... I need to know what is going on.<eos> Can you just tell me?<eos> I don't know where to begin.<eos> Well, maybe you should start by telling me why you're at Derek Roger's grave.<eos> Derek stumbled across some information, and was using it to blackmail me.
He knows about the twins.<eos> You don't seem surprised.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Rebecca told him, I'm sure.<eos> Okay, Dad, what is going on?<eos> Because if Rebecca is really that dangerous, then what are we doing living in her house?<eos> You have to trust me.<eos> I've never do anything to put you in danger, you know that.<eos> The safest place you can be is with me.<eos> - So you asked me for one night, and I gave it to you.
I mean,uh, it was insane.<eos> She did like seven crazy Kung Fu moves<eos> And some UFC stuff and some kind of crouching monkey/drunken panda thing<eos> She's like a trained killer.<eos> I, I gotta go to the cops.<eos> So, let me get this straight.<eos> Before, when you didn't know she could kill you, you were going to keep your promise to her. And now that you know she can kill you, you're going to break your promise to her?<eos> How does that make any sense?<eos> Sorry, I wasn't listening.<eos> Look, if you double cross her she's going to chop off your head and stuff it in your mouth.
Ali called.<eos> She was freaking out about some videos.<eos> Everyone wanted them.<eos> Spencer's big sister more than anyone.<eos> When I showed up, she begged me to talk to Ali.<eos> So I did.<eos> Then Ali left to go get them.<eos> Next day... she was missing.<eos> Who took that picture?<eos> You three on the sailboat. Who took it?
Um, no.<eos> Looks like it's a bit before my time.<eos> So is Duke Ellington.<eos> If he walks in the door, are you going to ask him not to play the piano?<eos> Wren:<eos> Spencer? I just learned you're admitted.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> Eddie, uh, could you check on Mr. Paterson?<eos> He may need assistance getting to physical therapy.<eos> He had it this morning.
- Yes.<eos> Good morning.<eos> I can not give any answer, just help with the police investigation again.<eos> In Hårsfjärden found this morning a fisherman remnants e 's an attack divers.<eos> It can be fisherman own son who had been missing since 7982.<eos> Attack diver Anders Lundberg believed to have disappeared during a mission.<eos> Kurt ...<eos> Mattson want to talk to you.<eos> A waiter came with your gun in the night.<eos> A full police had lost it.
Mattson want to talk to you.<eos> A waiter came with your gun in the night.<eos> A full police had lost it.<eos> - Two glasses.<eos> - Only?<eos> Wallander.<eos> Put yourself.<eos> - Do you recognize it?<eos> - Yes, it's mine.<eos> - You left it at a restaurant.
-Bummer.<eos> You gotta try edging, man.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's where you jerk off, okay?<eos> Right to the point of orgasm and then stop.<eos> And you do this because...<eos> Because your jizz is your power, man.<eos> It's spiritual, it keeps your Chi inside.<eos> Especially if you got writer's block.<eos> You gotta walk right up to that line, bro, and not cross it.
Every detail.<eos> Could you go back to the last image?<eos> Recognize her?<eos> Yeah, it's that wildlife photographer.<eos> Think there's any chance the camera survived?<eos> [scoffs] You kidding me?<eos> That's professional-grade Japanese engineering.<eos> That thing is built for the field.<eos> It'll take a licking and keep on ticking.<eos> You have it?
Our forces are overextended and underfunded.<eos> The potential edge these creatures provide could ensure our national security for decades, and the applications are limitless.<eos> I certainly hope you know what you're doing, Chris, because if we lose control of this thing, it'll make smallpox look like a bad rash.<eos> We are taking every precaution.<eos> What about the CDC and USAMRIID?<eos> Dr. Gordon and her people are in line for now.<eos> But Major Hoffman, on the other hand...<eos> Do we have the image yet?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Putting it on-screen now.
She's got the host DNA inside of her.<eos> GEN. MONNING: A tooth.<eos> A tooth from the host could contain the antibodies.<eos> [alarm blaring] She's bradycardic!<eos> Don't touch her.<eos> You're crazy!<eos> Curable lupine won't be a threat.<eos> You want to use those things as weapons?<eos> Can you imagine training them-- the heightened senses and strength of the animal, the intellect of a man?<eos> We need a cure, yes, but locked in a vault in the Pentagon so our enemies can't use it against us.
Come on.<eos> We gotta get out of here.<eos> You're not leaving the island with that tooth, Hoffman.<eos> You got 10 seconds to come out, or we start shooting.<eos> Kill us, and you'll never find it.<eos> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,<eos> 6, 7, 8, 9--<eos> All right, Monning.<eos> All right.<eos> You want the cure, you got it.
Audrey buys tons of crap we don't need.<eos> It seems like if you don't need it, that's a waste... Oh, ingrown toenail... Show him!<eos> My pedicurist turned me down.<eos> All right, that's enough!<eos> You know what?<eos> You know what this is all about?<eos> You can't stand being told you're wrong.<eos> Oh, and you have never seen a situation that you haven't tried to exploit.<eos> I see an opportunity.<eos> I seize it.
Yes.<eos> Dwelling in the Fuchun mountains is in our hands.<eos> The expression of ink within a square implies a painting.<eos> The strokes in the middle means water.<eos> And the part at the bottom means fire.<eos> Fire in conflict with water.<eos> Empress, is this about "dwelling in the Fuchun mountains"?<eos> The half of "dwelling in the Fuchun mountains" in taipei was stolen last night.<eos> Please contact Hong Kong hq.<eos> Huang Gongwang created it during the yuan dynasty.
The British already have their eyes on it<eos> I understand<eos> ls your heart racing?<eos> Please excuse me for not be able to see it.<eos> If I can touch it. Maybe I can answer you.<eos> Don't you want the other half of the painting?<eos> Both halves will soon be in front of us.<eos> But whom will it belong to?<eos> It belongs to it's true owner.<eos> Who holds it is the owner.
What the hell was that?<eos> Who the hell was that?<eos> Hey, Angie, I hate to say this, I don't like the guy, but Jacobs may have a point.<eos> I mean, West is the only person with any reason to kill Tiffany Greenwood.<eos> Have you ever known Jacobs to ignore evidence that could clear a suspect?<eos> Those cell phone records...<eos> Would never trump blood on a car in court.<eos> We know that.<eos> Jacobs is following the evidence.<eos> I feel like he's manufacturing it.
It's not here.<eos> I'm sorry, sir, to ask you these questions again.<eos> Can you think of anyone who might've wanted to hurt her?<eos> You just set him free.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Greenwood. Thank you, sir.<eos> The Greenwoods won't be adding you to their Christmas list any time soon.<eos> Now what?<eos> We keep looking for that bag.<eos> She babysat at the Jacobs.<eos> Maybe she left it there.
Holy Jesus.<eos> ..attached to a wire.<eos> Don't move any chairs or open any doors.<eos> Go easy, John boy.<eos> Boys, no.<eos> It's not in here.<eos> If it was in here, it would have blown by now.<eos> It was my name on that bullet Erasmus sent.<eos> He's set a trap all right.<eos> But he's set it up just for me.
And me.<eos> And...this.<eos> You're a dreamer, Freddie.<eos> You give money away while we rot in here... and you talk about revolution.<eos> I need to know.<eos> Who are you loyal to, Freddie?<eos> I said, "Who are you loyal to?"<eos> Did you have something to do with this?<eos> I asked an acquaintance for an address.<eos> She said she would only give it to me anonymously.
Don't flatter yourself.<eos> For Ada.<eos> And you think this copper will keep his word.<eos> If he does, you're safe.<eos> If he doesn't, Chapman will give you up, you'll still have to leave town.<eos> Same result.<eos> So neat(!<eos> ) So leave.<eos> Except there's one thing that you got wrong.<eos> Stanly won't be able to give up my address because he doesn't know it.
You are the friend I was talking about! (Dishes rattle) Oh.<eos> I think there's been a misunderstanding.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Let me make it clear now... we're roommates.<eos> We're not friends.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We... we... we've been hanging out.<eos> You took me on your murder tour.<eos> Yeah, I tricked you into buying my ticket.<eos> I didn't want to buy it and I wanted you to buy it. We cool?
- She's not!<eos> Now let's calm damn, folks.<eos> It's just business.<eos> Well, then it's good I've got my lawyer here, isn't it?<eos> Ms. Cardinal, I'm happy to offer you fifty thousand dollars for your property.<eos> Well, that offer is for the underlying mineral rights only, of course.<eos> No. I've got bigger plans for her property.<eos> It's the perfect location.<eos> I don't see one negative.<eos> Well, except I ain't selling' it to you.
Oh, my goodness. Beaten again.<eos> No hard feelings.<eos> Where's your car?<eos> Substance is 84% similar to kryptonite. No harmful effects to natives of krypton.<eos> 'That doesn't make sense. '<eos> I had the bat mobile tracking kryptonite.<eos> It wouldn't have picked this up.<eos> There must have been kryptonite in the van.<eos> What's the point of making kryptonite That wouldn't harm superman anyway.<eos> We'll put it away with the other kryptonite just to be safe.
Hey, batman, penny for your thoughts?<eos> Are we going upstairs?<eos> I'd love to see the rest of the place.<eos> Going down.<eos> We don't have a lot of time.<eos> Jump!<eos> Let him go, we have to find the vault. You're right.<eos> It's time to serve desert.<eos> Where does he keep the kryptonite?<eos> I just know he has it. Not where he hides it.
Did you read the business plan?<eos> Read it!<eos> - I read it.<eos> You want to expand, hire, buy land...<eos> And you're certain you'll have a 30% return within a year.<eos> 30-40%, Giampiero, it's a conservative estimate.<eos> It's not exactly a gift, you know...<eos> You'll give me 700,000 but I'm using my house as collateral, it's worth at least 900.<eos> Your house?<eos> You put it in Serena's name during the divorce.
He said to tell you he left for a meeting.<eos> Yes, a meeting with a pint at the pub.<eos> The plan about Formentera sound nice, you never told me.<eos> I didn't? Oh...<eos> - There'll be no danger of us hanging out.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - A cool band.<eos> Have a listen, but first we'll take a picture together.<eos> - Ready? - Yes.<eos> I'll use it for a drawing.
Have you ever taken one to help you?<eos> No, I'm nursing.<eos> What about marijuana?<eos> I know Connor smokes... do you?<eos> Seriously?<eos> You dragged both of us in here for a little pot?<eos> So, you and Elle Shipley broke up a year and a half ago.<eos> About that, yeah.<eos> But you still have a key to her house?<eos> I think I still have it on my key ring.
Well, being dead kind of rules him out as a murder suspect, right?<eos> Oliver...<eos> I'm sorry I came at you so hard, man.<eos> But I've been there.<eos> I know what it's like to stare death in the face and...be the one who blinks.<eos> That's not it.<eos> I've...<eos> I've been close to death.<eos> On the island...<eos> More times than I can remember, and I never feared it.
Maybe one of the other girls roped you into it.<eos> Is that how it went down?<eos> Look, I'm not trying to get anybody in trouble.<eos> It was just supposed to be a prank.<eos> Take a few pictures, so Jessica could see how it feels for a change.<eos> We owed it to Lindsay.<eos> Janelle stole Nadira's phone.<eos> We texted Jessica and told her to wait at the Pit.<eos> We got the GHB from Lindsay's room, and Caitlin poured it into a bottle of raspberry vodka.<eos> We left it there for Jessica.
You know, if you're done.<eos> Are we done?<eos> Sure.<eos> We'll talk about it when you get home.<eos> I'm always here at 8:55, and I'm never late, so I would've... oh, thank God you're here.<eos> - Officer, this is Dr. Kim.<eos> - Morning, doctor.<eos> Someone broke into the office early this morning.<eos> - The alarm company called. - What happened?<eos> - It looks like... - Well, we think they stole a key card and used it to get inside the building.
- The alarm company called. - What happened?<eos> - It looks like... - Well, we think they stole a key card and used it to get inside the building.<eos> That's pretty much the theory.<eos> Dr. Kim, is it okay if I take the day off?<eos> I... I'm feeling a little rattled.<eos> That's fine, Lila.<eos> It doesn't appear anything was taken, but you should look around just in case.<eos> It seems your office was the one targeted.<eos> Is something wrong, doctor?<eos> My computer's on, and I always shut it off before I leave.
I'm just leaving and I'm late already.<eos> Harry.<eos> Harry. Please, please.<eos> Please.<eos> Stay.<eos> Just give me a minute.<eos> Uh... I had a job interview today.<eos> And I think I'm gonna get the offer.<eos> Well, we'll see what happens, right?<eos> If I get the offer, you want me to take it, right?
What?<eos> Empty your pockets.<eos> Why?<eos> This isn't Russia.<eos> You need a reason.<eos> You're acting high, you're sniffing compulsively, and you're wearing a coke spoon.<eos> It's hers.<eos> Slow down, hoss.<eos> We haven't found anything yet.<eos> Mm. Honestly, I was just holding it for her.
And I've been up ever since.<eos> Running on coffee and cigarettes, huh?<eos> Oh, coffee, yes, but I haven't smoked in years.<eos> Oh. Well, excuse me.<eos> Could you show me Charlie's room?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What's up?<eos> Did you fill out the application for the Milk warrant?<eos> I submitted it to Judge Davis, but...
Not really.<eos> She got emotional when she got this card from her parents.<eos> Oh. This card?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She cried like a baby.<eos> "We're so proud of you."<eos> When did she get this?<eos> Three days ago.<eos> The day before she died.<eos> After she got the card, she started writing this letter in Spanish, but then she got frustrated and ripped it up.

But first, I must deal with treason within the ranks, the two renegades who voted against the bill.<eos> I have zero tolerance for betrayal, which they will soon indelibly learn.<eos> I know why you lost the vote.<eos> Somebody got to Vanderburgh and Abrams.<eos> Remy Danton.<eos> Your wife.<eos> I've got contacts on both their staffs.<eos> There was a meeting between the three of them.<eos> I know.<eos> I arranged it.
You offered me insurance if the bike got lost or stolen, you know, but I turned it down.<eos> Yeah, you said it was for suckers.<eos> Well, I thought maybe I should sign up for it.<eos> Okay, yeah.<eos> Well, we can do that.<eos> I'll just need to scan the barcode on the bike.<eos> Ah, yeah, absolutely.<eos> That makes total sense.<eos> Um, it's just right outside.<eos> Just gonna go get it.
There are no words for my regret.<eos> The Devil... lives inside Sister Mary Eunice. You were right. I tried to cast it out, but I failed.<eos> In truth, it was an epic failure.<eos> She'll destroy everything.<eos> Why didn't I listen to you?<eos> Why was I so stubborn?<eos> She's destroyed you.<eos> And now she's destroyed me.<eos> My virtue is gone, Jude.<eos> She took it from me, violated me.
I'm not yours.<eos> I never will be.<eos> I'd rather die than allow you to defile the Church.<eos> Are you talking?<eos> You've suddenly grown quite tiresome.<eos> You'll not win. You couldn't even defeat Sister Mary Eunice.<eos> Her purity remains alive inside, I know it.<eos> Don't make me reconsider my largess, Timothy.<eos> I will cast you out and return Mary Eunice to her state of grace.<eos> I gave you a chance, Timothy, but you've just pissed it away!
A short audience, Your Majesty.<eos> You're leaving Briarcliff?<eos> But you're not leaving the Church.<eos> On the contrary.<eos> I've been appointed Cardinal.<eos> Of New York.<eos> Well, good for you.<eos> You had a dream, you made it come true.<eos> You should also know that the Church is relinquishing ownership of Briarcliff.<eos> We've donated it to the state.
Mr Shelby, you have to do something about him.<eos> Damn right, Harry.<eos> You pay the Peaky Blinders a lot of money for protection.<eos> You're the law around here now, Tommy, aren't you?<eos> Maybe you should put a bullet in Danny Whizz Bang's head like they do with mad horses.<eos> Maybe you'll have to put a bullet in my head someday, too.<eos> Bring the bill to the Peaky Blinders.<eos> We'll take care of this.<eos> Look at the gun.<eos> Recognise it? Oof! Get up off your arse, you mumping pig!
We'll take care of this.<eos> Look at the gun.<eos> Recognise it? Oof! Get up off your arse, you mumping pig!<eos> Aunt Pol!<eos> What the fuck d'you do that for? !<eos> Finn was playing with this this afternoon by the cut.<eos> It was loaded.<eos> He nearly blew Ada's tits off.<eos> It must've fell out of my pocket.<eos> He said he found it on the sideboard of the betting shop... with bullets in it.
Nothing happens in that factory without you knowing about it.<eos> Speak.<eos> God and Aunt Polly are listening.<eos> It was meant to be routine.<eos> I had a buyer in London for some... motorcycles.<eos> I asked my men to steal me four bikes with petrol engines.<eos> I'm guessing my men were drunk.<eos> There's a still inside the factory makes tram-line gin.<eos> They picked up the wrong fucking crate.<eos> The boys dropped it at Charlie Strong's yard as agreed.
You weren't so stiff back there, were you?<eos> You ever been in a house this big?<eos> Look at you.<eos> You look like a bloody film star.<eos> I want a cigarette.<eos> Oh, look, I dropped something.<eos> Pick it up.<eos> Pick it up yourself.<eos> You're a fucking barmaid.<eos> If I drop a glass on the floor, you pick it up.

Three minutes, what?<eos> Wow, okay.<eos> You okay?<eos> Ooh. Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> It's duck with what?<eos> Actually it's a Kalbi marinade, which is, um, Korean short ribs, but I used duck instead.<eos> - Right. Are we ready?<eos> - I think so.<eos> So is this, like, a sort of a lettuce wrap?<eos> In Korea, when we eat Korean barbecue, we wrap it in lettuce and have samjang sauce, which is the sauce on top.
Right, well, I divorced you, not her.<eos> Hey, you can barely make ends meet here.<eos> I'm just trying to help.<eos> I don't want it, and I don't need it.<eos> Then we'll continue talking through the lawyer.<eos> I love you, honey.<eos> Good night, dad.<eos> There.<eos> There's where I found the bag.<eos> Did you see who tossed it?
Who's next, huh?<eos> - You're back.<eos> - Yep.<eos> So, uh... how'd everything go?<eos> It was great, actually.<eos> Turns out, Ade and I make kind of a good team.<eos> Mm! So, uh, does that mean you're reconsidering working for me?<eos> Not necessary.<eos> The financial aid office called.<eos> A last-minute scholarship came through and I got it.
But... Does she...<eos> Do you think...? !<eos> - Where did the blood come from?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I cut myself on something on the way home.<eos> Why would I kill Tommy? !<eos> Can you show me the shirt?<eos> And why not?<eos> I threw it away before Lou woke up.<eos> You threw it away.
It's all centered in here.<eos> So how'd he get away?<eos> It's like he vanished into thin air.<eos> Oh, so he's a magical zombie?<eos> I never said that.<eos> That window's open.<eos> No way.<eos> We're on the third floor.<eos> That's quite a jump.<eos> From the blood smears, looks like he broke his leg, dragged it behind him as he hobbled away.
With Gil Evans.<eos> My mom's.<eos> She has good taste.<eos> I know that song.<eos> ♪ I can't give you anything but love ♪<eos> ♪ Baby<eos> She used to sing it to me when I was little for a lully.<eos> So it was a pretty cool birthday card.<eos> Think the song is a key?<eos> We found it in a stack.
The color brings out your eyes or something, it's really...<eos> It's tight.<eos> Even your moccasins, those are awesome also.<eos> Just got it all going on.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You enjoying the party?<eos> Yeah, it's fun.<eos> You know what your outfit's missing?<eos> Is this hat.<eos> I think it'd complete it.
I just feel like everything in my life needs to change.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Have you ever been a blonde?<eos> Two bedrooms, one-and-a-half baths, and a bonus room off the garage.<eos> Ignore the floor. A rock band rented it for a month.<eos> And they had a lot of parrots.<eos> You'll just replace the carpet.<eos> Or you'll put the vent there when you install the new heating system.<eos> - What's wrong with the heating system?<eos> - The former owner took it.
D.B.: Hello! Oh!<eos> Hey!<eos> It's me, D.B.<eos> - Whoa, what...?<eos> - What's happening, Marvin?<eos> It's Marshall.<eos> - Well, what are you doing here?<eos> - Last night on Skype, I asked if you were gonna have trouble sleeping without your pregnancy pillow.<eos> And you said, "uh-huh, I totally hear you."<eos> And I said, "do you want me to bring it to the ranch?" And you said, "uh-huh, I totally hear you."
Oh, well, let's not get crazy.<eos> School's for nerds.<eos> Oh, I do not feel good.<eos> This always happens whenever I disagree with you.<eos> You don't know my kid, Bobby.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> Oh, I have got to lie down.<eos> First Jules questions my parenting, and now you?<eos> I mean, I'm a good parent, damn it.<eos> When Travis lost a toenail, you super glued it back to his foot and stuck all of his toes together.
Then she won't have the satisfaction she desires.<eos> Good afternoon, Miss Lane.<eos> We were discussing the mole catcher problem.<eos> Well, ask Joe.<eos> He'll know.<eos> Joe?<eos> Why do mole catchers die?<eos> Strychnine.<eos> Well, it gets on to your hands.<eos> And then you're breathing it in and then, well, it's in your blood.
What can you see?<eos> What is it?<eos> Hey!<eos> Boy!<eos> Get inside now.<eos> Tell your mother what you were doing!<eos> No?<eos> I'll tell her.<eos> Stone picking for Rutter.<eos> This farm's halfway dead because there's no-one to work it, and me own son stone picking for Rutter.
Every one of these graves tells us a story, not just of some brave Tommy, but of a brother, a father, a son who died doing what they saw was their duty - their service to the nation.<eos> In Flanders fields The poppies blow. Between the crosses, row on row. That mark our place.<eos> And in the sky. The larks, still bravely singing Fly. Scarce heard amid the guns below.<eos> We are the dead.<eos> Scarce days ago.<eos> We lived, felt dawn Saw sunset glow.<eos> Loved and were loved.<eos> And now we lie. In Flanders fields.<eos> Take up our quarrel with the foe:<eos> To you from failing hands we throw. The torch, be yours to hold it high. If ye break faith with us who die.
What's that for?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Ay, caramba!<eos> That's our professor?<eos> Hello, everyone.<eos> - My name is Gerri Dandridge, - Hey, Gerri... and I'm the visiting professor at this university.<eos> Over the next week that you are here I want to give you an overview of the history of European aft, a history that is riddled with blood and madness, brilliance and glory.<eos> A history that, when I am through with you, you will feel as though you have actually lived through it.
- Are you one of them or not?<eos> - Them?<eos> - A vampire!<eos> Of course I'm not a vampire!<eos> - Satisfied?<eos> - Let him in.<eos> - What the hell is that?<eos> - It's a Stake-O-Fix.<eos> The weapon that is said to have killed Vlad the Impaler, aka motherfucking Dracula.<eos> - And you got it how?
As long as there's a camera, the revolution will continue.<eos> The problem now with the media Is that they oppose change And turn people against the revolution.<eos> So what will you do?<eos> Well, I am going to keep exposing them.<eos> And they'll keep exposing themselves.<eos> Until The corrupt media falls.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> Start a television station?<eos> Yes, hopefully I will.<eos> Well you'll have to put it in Cyprus or else they will destroy it.
I would never be proud of standing with the Brotherhood to attack others.<eos> When this revolution started I told you that it was for you.<eos> For your sister and brother.<eos> For you to write history.<eos> You have to stand as an individual.<eos> You can think for yourself.<eos> With all due respect to you and the Brotherhood And other Islamists Or any other groups<eos> You have a brain. You can think for yourself.<eos> We have to ask ourselves "Who created this situation?"<eos> Did the revolution create it?
Yeah, Okay, but a gun?<eos> How did he pull that off?<eos> I got to admit It wasn't easy.<eos> I found a series of proprietary algorithmic programming files... backed up on the Zip drive... that Justin kept on his key chain.<eos> Now, at first... it just looked like a... bunch of foreign language.<eos> Until I saw a few words... that I recognized.<eos> When I put all that information together... along with the... trace swabs and dust void measurements from Justin's workshop... I got a better idea of what he was up to.<eos> Once he designed the software to drive it, the parts and supplies needed to print a gun were available online... and at the local hardware store.<eos> All he had to do was hit Command-P, then sit back and watch.<eos> His printer was probably a little more homegrown than ours... but the software that ran it... gave us the same end result.
Show me, don't tell me.<eos> And it takes regular rounds?<eos> See for yourself. Be careful where you point that.<eos> You're telling me to be careful?<eos> When you just gave a gold mine... to the wrong guy.<eos> What-what are you talking about?<eos> You're a genius, kid.<eos> For an idiot.<eos> You killed an innocent young man, and then stole his idea.<eos> Then used it to kill someone else.
Uh, you want these anywhere in particular?<eos> Uh, you can just put 'em right there for now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Fixed your shower.<eos> Already, huh?<eos> Knock yourself out.<eos> No, Harry, uh, j--<eos> I have the worst timing in history.<eos> You okay?<eos> He told me to fix it myself.
Falcon, we need a coil gun that can fire a small sun.<eos> You and lightning rod are the pair. {*corr} Lots of speed, lots of electricity.<eos> Try to keep up and get ready to bring the thunder.<eos> He has your spark.<eos> I like him.<eos> Anyone not shielded by armor or gamma-irradiated skin should probably clear the area of civilians.<eos> - Hulk, it's time to get angry.<eos> - My favorite time of day.<eos> It's physics, risky physics.<eos> Tony's betting we can contain the force of the explosion and direct it into space like a bullet from a gun at 3,000 miles per minute.
What's your last name?<eos> Decody.<eos> No, but I brought some books.<eos> "Decody." Is that Italian?<eos> No, no, it isn't.<eos> We're from the U.K., actually.<eos> Hey, mom, uh, didn't you... didn't you need me to go to the grocery store?<eos> - Come sit down. - Do you have that list?<eos> Have a seat.<eos> No, I haven't made it yet.
He's moving out.<eos> He packed up last night.<eos> Even so.<eos> Can't go back there, not for...<eos> You have a dog, a cat, any real reason you got to be there?<eos> No.<eos> We couldn't even commit to a dog.<eos> Well, first, let me say how utterly delighted I am to be here.<eos> I typically find my visits to Chelsea general to be enormously fruitful.<eos> Before we go on the record, let me say if at anytime you do not understand my question, Dr. park, please feel absolutely free to say so, and I will restate it.
Oh, and I'd lay off the sweet and sour for a while.<eos> The heads were your idea.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That worked well.<eos> Yeah, I'd say so.<eos> You got us off the hook.<eos> For now.<eos> How do you think the crew feel knowing every time you fuck something up, they pay?<eos> They were punks.<eos> You gave an order, they followed it.
Before Maddie died.<eos> I know.<eos> I apologize.<eos> No, I understand.<eos> It's going to hit Charlie hard too when I...<eos> Hey, ssh.<eos> I'm counting on you, Jimmy.<eos> You've got to see him through this, okay?<eos> You've got some serious equipment here, Nancy.<eos> Yeah, the control room, Charlie calls it.
One morning, I hear this scream.<eos> I run in, Alec holding his chin.<eos> Blood everywhere.<eos> Max, in his crib, laughing his head off at a moth going round and round inside the dome.<eos> Alec had fallen off the chair trying to rescue the fucker. Hm.<eos> Sam wanted to rescue things all the time, too.<eos> Everything.<eos> Flies.<eos> Spiders. Earwigs.<eos> He'd get his cup and put it on top and then slide his drawing pad underneath.
She was on ecstasy, and she got a hold of my P.I.N. number.<eos> Nobody cares, Yoni.<eos> It's time for you to go.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> Let... let me just stay for four to six weeks.<eos> Four to six weeks?<eos> Can I at least borrow 5 bucks for cigarettes?<eos> - No! - No.<eos> (Yakult barking) Come on, Yakult.<eos> Let's go play that game daddy Altman invented where I throw a ball and you bring it back.
There is a lot of activity down here.<eos> Look, dudes. Dudes, dudes, dudes!<eos> Dr. Telamericorp!<eos> He's crossed over into the physical world!<eos> It's only a matter of time before he finds a human host!<eos> - What?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Yep.<eos> You're not gonna get me twice, Ders.<eos> I think I know barbeque sauce when I see it.
And then I think we sold an idea to trick.<eos> Yes, we did!<eos> And he gave us a little doggie bag. A little ba-ba-ba-ba...<eos> Hey, where's the unburnable flag?<eos> - Right?<eos> - We need it.<eos> Trick says it's, like, a big, juicy grape.<eos> - Yeah. - Wait. You pitched my idea?<eos> No, we pitched him our idea.<eos> You may have had the initial thought, but we fleshed it out and made it sexy.
So, that's why he calls me, get me up there real quick, and he said, "Do you know a bass player?"<eos> I said, "I know a great bass player."<eos> So, I started playing, and he said,<eos> "Do you know of any other rhythm guys?"<eos> I said, "Yeah, Freeman Brown,"<eos> who became one of the best fat back drummers for Muscle Shoals.<eos> He said, "And I also need a horn section,"<eos> and I said, "Yeah, there's some guys"<eos> that I met out of Nashville."<eos> Rick Hall wanted to put a band together and called it the "Fame Gang,"
It was after those sessions that Chris Blackwell had the idea to link them up with Steve Winwood.<eos> When we were going through our formative years,<eos> I started hearing this Southern soul music, and of course, I didn't really have any concept of Muscle Shoals or the musicians or their background when I was first hearing this music,<eos> I just knew that the music had something very special for me, so when we actually got to work with them, it was an amazing experience for us.<eos> ♪ Sometimes I feel so uninspired ♪<eos> Recording with Traffic was a very strange thing.<eos> It was... to me, it was strange.<eos> Of course, Traffic weren't a mainstream band at all.<eos> We would try and take elements of rock, jazz, folk music, all sorts of different ethnic music.<eos> Our own particular name for it was Headless Horseman music.
Watch your backs.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> Frank Ashkani, you're under arrest for the murder of Tommy Sutter.<eos> You have the right to remind silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.<eos> You have the right to an attorney.<eos> If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you by the courts.<eos> - You did this to me.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> You kept the gun after the shooting. You planted my fingerprints on it, and you dropped it by the burial site.
Why?<eos> No sexual assault on the first victim.<eos> And nothing obvious taken.<eos> But he's gotta be taking something from them.<eos> Besides their sight?<eos> I'll put out the A.P.B. on the Cadillac.<eos> Let's get the M.E. to the hospital, look at her eyes.<eos> Make sure we're dealing with the same thing.<eos> This is where it all started.<eos> I came home, I closed the door and locked it, and then all of a sudden the floor was gone.
Open the door!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Open the door!<eos> Hey!<eos> What is it?<eos> Come in.<eos> Minoru is not your brother.<eos> I am very sorry, but your brother is dead.<eos> You deny reality, and fear it.
not shooting birds in the wood what kind of monster do you think I am?<eos> I don't know you well enough to guess yeah well I'm actually a nice guy you have that on your curriculum vitae my what?<eos> your resume yeah I know what a CV is alright!<eos> I didn't get where I am today because I'm a freaking idiot and where are you today officer Miller?<eos> lost in the freaking desert you're lost too well you got us lost copper the compass was broken sorry to offend an officer of the LAPD!<eos> you're going to hit me. you were going to hit me go ahead and hit me, you want me?<eos> pick me?<eos> you have fucking courage Richfield go ahead, I know you've wanted to<eos> You're so fucking paranoid that I'm going to take your precious Foist account.<eos> did you know that Parsons promised it to me?
This is not about beating Peter.<eos> So you're angry at me now?<eos> Do I look angry?<eos> My directive here is simple: clean up political corruption.<eos> That's all.<eos> You underestimate me if you think I'm working from bias.<eos> I'll be in touch.<eos> And you'll read our complaint?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> I have it right here.
Timing, right?<eos> Hey, leave the mask.<eos> Yeah, of course... mask.<eos> Yeah, that makes sense.<eos> I use a mask myself, in my act.<eos> But you have to tell me how you do that bean bag trick.<eos> Well, I guess, since you're a magician, too.<eos> But not a word of this.<eos> I did use a mask.<eos> I put it on another guy, and then I was in the bean bag chair the whole time.
And I?<eos> You have to find your own peace.<eos> Papal guard.<eos> Forward.<eos> I will speak with the prisoner.<eos> - You are relieved.<eos> -Yes, Your Eminence.<eos> - What is this?<eos> -This is your freedom.<eos> - Don't forget who put it in your hands.
Better to bury your head in the sand?<eos> Yeah, yeah, pretty much what I'm thinking.<eos> I just got a tip. Joe Lucas is meeting a guy.<eos> We're gonna go listen in.<eos> If it doesn't sound worth the trouble, I will drop Terry, and you can go back to not stalking me, 'K?<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You've had a rough couple of years.<eos> I read your file.<eos> All that baggage, right now you're carrying it here and here.
And he made himself look like her neighbour.<eos> Wait, what do you mean?<eos> He can change his appearance.<eos> He can make himself look like other people.<eos> I don't know how he does it, but it's real.<eos> And he pretended like he didn't know me...<eos> so I confronted him.<eos> He said, "I don't know any Marcus", right, because he's a liar.<eos> And I-I-I tried to get him to go, and he fought, so I thought,<eos> "His wallet... his wallet will prove who he really is", and I grabbed it.

I need you to start thinkin' with your head.<eos> Give our friend a chair.<eos> Frank, I need you to do what he says.<eos> Now listen fellas, I've got a problem.<eos> You know, I like this guy. I really do.<eos> But I'm in a bit of a dilemma.<eos> My merchandise has gone missing.<eos> And when I lose my merchandise, to make me feel better,<eos> I have to kill somebody.<eos> Vin, Vin... As I was sayin' before my friend walked in, We... will find your stuff, we'll sell it, we'll fill your pockets with cash.
I was there.<eos> I saw his face.<eos> He was devastated.<eos> And my instincts are telling me that he is telling the truth.<eos> Instincts?<eos> Right.<eos> Don't even try to say it's because I slept with him.<eos> Wow.<eos> Look.<eos> If I came to you with this story, would you believe it?
I'm not debating this.<eos> They're counting on you to get emotional.<eos> If you do, you're gonna lose the election.<eos> - Chup the election.<eos> - Really?<eos> Yes.<eos> If Datak wins this election, he's gonna kick open the doors to Colonel Marsh and his E-Rep goons and a year from now, you won't even recognize this place.<eos> And it certainly will not be one you wanna live in.<eos> I care about this town.<eos> I'm not gonna be the thing that kills it.
What?<eos> Something from the '90s.<eos> If it moves me, I'll consider letting you live.<eos> I was born in the '90s, I don't know any of those songs.<eos> Then you're dead. Uh... Uh, uh... ♪ You are... my fire ♪<eos> Man, you look like you could use a change of underwear.<eos> Not cool, dudes. Oh, oh.<eos> Congratulations, you are now officially a pledge of the Beta Phi Tau.<eos> Now, onto the first test in your initiation.<eos> We call it the century.
That's pretty pimp.<eos> Yeah, well, it's been owned by the same family since 1864.<eos> And they allow a small population of about a hundred native Hawaiians to live there.<eos> Yup, no longer as interesting.<eos> They live entirely off the land.<eos> They have no telephones, no running water.<eos> And the only way outsiders can visit is through one of these exclusive hunting trips.<eos> It's also home to thousands of plant species that exist nowhere else in the world.<eos> So what are we thinking?<eos> Cutler-- he goes over there looking for this extinct plant, uh, he finds it, and somehow, it gets him killed?
I went on to work as a botanist for an agricultural engineering firm, and...<eos> Well, then, three years ago, everything changed, when my son, Avery-- he was diagnosed with a degenerative disease.<eos> Adrenoleukodystrophy.<eos> Yeah. I'd never heard of it, either.<eos> It's very rare.<eos> It...<eos> It affects about one in every 100,000.<eos> And ever since my son's diagnosis, well, I've dedicated my life to beating the disease.<eos> Okay, so that's... that's why you're out here-- searching for a cure?<eos> It's taken me some time, but I... I think I found it.
Yeah.<eos> No. Dean, no.<eos> We're not summoning a crossroads demon.<eos> Plan "A" bombed, so welcome to plan "B" -- we get some red-eyed bitch in a trap, then we hold a knife on her until she calls us in a pooch -- special delivery.<eos> Yeah, except when Crowley finds out we're dialing up hell, he won't send one Hellhound -- he'll send a hundred.<eos> That's not a plan, Dean -- that's suicide.<eos> Well, you got a better idea?<eos> Yeah, we stay here.<eos> I just talked to Alice in the barn.<eos> Carl didn't sell his soul for oil -- he sold it for Alice.
I thought she was with you.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> No!<eos> Go back to the house.<eos> Go!<eos> Move!<eos> No!<eos> What was that thing?<eos> It was a Hellhound.<eos> See, when you sell your soul to a demon, they're the ones that come and rip it out of you.
- Think or you know?<eos> - I'm clear.<eos> Sure as hell better hope so.<eos> Remember that thief that we busted who was casing apartments using the stupid ferret story?<eos> Chrissee with two "E" s?<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> Yeah, well, the bigger the lie,<eos> - the more people buy it.
"To tidy things up."<eos> You were the District Attorney.<eos> You didn't go after him.<eos> That.<eos> Oh, and also there was a crucial piece of evidence that was never found.<eos> What murder weapon?<eos> What murder weapon?<eos> How many times have we had this conversation?<eos> You've never said a word!<eos> He was supposed to destroy it.
I-I'd feel so much better if you were here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um... Thank you.<eos> And, uh, I'll see you later on tonight.<eos> Bye.<eos> She failed the polygraph and lost $1/2 million all in one day.<eos> Stay close to her and find out what she's hiding.<eos> You have something for me?<eos> Finally, the golf club.<eos> Robert, I don't know what you're gonna do, but he is your son, and he just did what he thought was the right thing to do, so... if I want your opinion, I'll ask for it.
Then I'm free to come here every day.<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> Take a break.<eos> What did you say?<eos> 15 euros?<eos> Let me get my wallet.<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> - I bought it from a Somalian.
Calm down, you'll get it.<eos> - You've been saying that for weeks.<eos> If I don't get it tomorrow I'll break your neck.<eos> Who's breaking what?<eos> Nothing, bro.<eos> - Who is this guy?<eos> Listen, I don't mean to disrespect you, but this guy is taking the piss.<eos> But you do disrespect me, asshole.<eos> - See what I mean?<eos> This man calls me for shit, I give it to him, he doesn't pay me.
In that case, just tell me.<eos> It's fine with me.<eos> You can come and train once a week, but then I won't invest any energy in you.<eos> What's that?<eos> - Food.<eos> I don't think I can have this.<eos> I don't think it'll kill you.<eos> Come, I'll leave it there.<eos> I've brought you your rock.<eos> You know how long I've had it?
- We have very reliable information.<eos> Including the route of the money transport.<eos> We'll finance all the equipment you'll need.<eos> We take 40 percent.<eos> If you do it with five men, you'll easily have 200K each.<eos> That's a lot of money.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I have that fight two days later.<eos> Are you watching or am I watching this film by myself?<eos> I've already seen it, you know.
I used to like the second arch on the left hand side, because it was just that handy.<eos> You could pop in and out the band room all the time.<eos> There was about two rows in the front, they would leave their rollers in until before the lads would come onstage, and then they'd take their rollers out and doll theirselves up and everything.<eos> It was conversation all the time with the audience.<eos> Somebody came in, a different hairstyle, they'd pick on them.<eos> They'd go "Have you been the hairdresser's?"<eos> or "Who got you up this morning?"<eos> But he answered them back.<eos> They liked the razzmatazz between you and them.<eos> People used to write down a number, give it to them, and ask them would they right play that number.

The post office, give them their due, were very good, they just knew where the fan club existed.<eos> The type of questions kids would ask in the fan club letters was, you know, 'Can I have a piece of Paul's shirt? ' or 'If I send you a map, can you ask<eos> Paul to come 'round at 6 o'clock?<eos> Because I'm having a party and I'd like him to come.'<eos> But then it got a bit out of hand, because then people wanted hair, and it was the same barber that cut their hair, it was always this one guy.<eos> I mean, it was their hair, they'd probably do DNA on it now.<eos> He would have a mat down on the floor or something, and cut their hair... 'cos he thought I was mental.<eos> And he'd just say "There you go, do you want that bit?"<eos> I'd go "Yeah, yeah, thanks."<eos> Somebody sent a pillowcase in and said "Can you get Ritchie to sleep on this pillowcase and then send it back to me and get him to sign it?"

'cos I just wanted it out of the way, and he went, "Well, no, who's it to?"<eos> and I think it was because I was going,<eos> "Oh, it doesn't matter, just sign it,"<eos> and I remember saying to him, "Oh, just sign the book, just sign the book,"<eos> and he flicked it to the front, and he went, "Is this yours?"<eos> and I went, "Yeah, I haven't got your autograph,<eos> I just want your autograph before you go to London."<eos> So he signed it, and he pocketed it, he took it, and I went, "What are you doing with me book?"<eos> and he went, "I'll get the others for ya."<eos> And then next time he came in, he just threw it on the table, he went, "There you go." And they'd all put little comments in it.
Thank goodness the rumors about Paul are over.<eos> Paul is still with us, and is likely to be with us for a long time.<eos> Congratulations to Ringo and Maureen, who are expecting their second baby shortly after Maureen's next birthday.<eos> George has been to the dentist again.<eos> Dear Beatle People, after nearly four months of solid session work, the new LP, called<eos> Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, is ready.<eos> Beatles are hoping to acquire their own private recording studios at a secret location in central London.<eos> New Beatles recording every week.<eos> In one short period of just over four months, The Beatles have released no less than sixteen new recordings.<eos> John hated his passport photograph so much that he tore it up and had a new picture taken.
Go. I don't want a puddle.<eos> Thank you.<eos> 60 seconds.<eos> One alligator, two alligator, three alligator...<eos> Comfortable there, Mrs Tate?<eos> I bet you didn't think you'd get that cape finished before baby came.<eos> Oh, Nurse, you'd think I'd know the difference between a false alarm and the real thing by now.<eos> I've only done it five times before.<eos> SHE COUGHS That's a nasty cough.<eos> Had it for ages.
I do. But this can't go back on.<eos> Promise?<eos> Sir, with respect, we need an X-ray van in Poplar now.<eos> While the disease remains undetected, patients will die.<eos> Patients do die sometimes, Dr Turner.<eos> I would say that was an occupational hazard.<eos> Sir, I have just diagnosed a heavily pregnant patient with advanced TB. She has five children.<eos> She might well die, because I didn't know she was ill.<eos> You know that TB need no longer be a death sentence.<eos> We can treat it.
The vans ARE coming to London.<eos> Where to?<eos> Mayfair?<eos> Chelsea?<eos> What, pray, are you suggesting?<eos> Have you ever been to Poplar?<eos> No.<eos> In Poplar, we might have up to a dozen people living in one small house or tenement flat.<eos> When conditions are over-crowded and unventilated, infection spreads with ease.<eos> Meanwhile, someone who is infected unwittingly takes the disease to an over-crowded production line and transmits it to his colleagues.
But there are six of you here?<eos> Mrs Bailey likes to talk.<eos> Jacob has two brothers... we're quiet people.<eos> We get along with it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We intend to take rooms of our own.<eos> It's just not that easy to find them that will rent to us.<eos> The colour bar, Miss.<eos> My mother has this china.<eos> I brought it with me... ..to remind me of her.
What are we waiting for, then?<eos> Cover this up.<eos> Let's be on our way.<eos> What is that?<eos> I know that tune.<eos> "As Time Goes By."<eos> I hope so.<eos> It's from "Casablanca."<eos> Right.<eos> Dad used to whistle it from time to time.
Just bring out buckets of stuff and... I'm telling you, boy, people that come to be zombies they're really dedicated.<eos> They'll dig into that stuff and chew on it<eos> and I'm going, "Oy!"<eos> You'll never get me to do that!<eos> That's guts! It's guts!<eos> When I was gonna show it, I'm thinking to myself they're probably just gonna say, "That sucked Mr. Chris."<eos> Or whatever it may be.<eos> And sure enough, it was the-- it was the complete opposite.<eos> It's amazing the impact that this movie made, that this guy made-- you know, with no budget.<eos> How it still was important and how it still resonates with everyone who watches it.
How long you guys been down there?<eos> I could've used some help up here.<eos> That's the cellar.<eos> It's the safest place.<eos> Which is this hokey thing that horror movies and sci fi movies still do.<eos> That no matter, you know, how much you may differ in real life, all that's going to get cast aside because you have to fight the monster or fight the alien or whatever.<eos> The cellar.<eos> The cellar, there's only one door, right?<eos> Just one door, that's all we have to protect.<eos> Tom and I fixed it so it locks and boards from the inside.
But down in the cellar, there's no place to run to.<eos> Romero actually suggests that, nope, it's going to be embedded even in the way you choose to fight, even in where you choose to hide.<eos> But the cellar is the strongest place.<eos> The cellar is a death trap.<eos> Who you are in real life is going to absolutely affect how you treat this threat and how you see this threat.<eos> You put people in this incredibly extreme circumstance and, you know, what kind of society do they create?<eos> And that's the heart of "Night of the Living Dead."<eos> You two do whatever you like.<eos> I'm going back down into the cellar and you better decide!<eos> Because I'm going to board up that door and I'm not going to unlock it again no matter what happens!
Regarding the ghetto, it stated:<eos> And while "black militancy" may have added fuel to the riots, the primary cause was:<eos> We are moving toward two societies, separate and unequal and if something isn't done to stop this in a very determined manner things can really get worse.<eos> A few days later "Night of the Living Dead"<eos> was finally completed.<eos> Image 10 still needed a distributor for the film.<eos> With the hope of finding one in New York City,<eos> Romero and Streiner pick up the first finished print from the lab.<eos> Threw it in the trunk of the car.<eos> Finished answer print, drove it to New York to see if anybody wanted to show it.
The drive in movie was the Whitestone Drive In in the Bronx.<eos> The part where the little girl, she's, like, eating the father.<eos> That was, like, really horrible!<eos> It took me a long time to get to sleep at night.<eos> And when the lights was off it was hard for us.<eos> You know, I remember a few times I wet the bed because I was scared to get up to go to the bathroom because I always thought that the "Night of the Living Dead"<eos> was in the other room.<eos> You feel so, like, "Oh, my God, they're coming..." They're going to come to get me and eat me up!"<eos> An abridged version of Roger Ebert's review was published nationwide in Reader's Digest magazine.<eos> In spite of this warning to parents, the film did so well that the National Association of Theater Owners selected it as their
on a new double bill.<eos> They played it with "Slaves?"<eos> I mean, I couldn't believe that.<eos> You know?<eos> What?<eos> "Slaves" and "Night of the Living Dead?"<eos> How does that connect?<eos> But it was at this double-feature where George Abagnolo, critic for Andy Warhol's ultra-hip "Interview" magazine, saw "Night."<eos> He wrote:<eos> And when the film got to Europe in 1970, the prestigious French film journal, "Positif," called it:

Mm, you know, one doesn't like to brag, so one will not.<eos> - But, uh, what about you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Big time doctor.<eos> All the ladies after you.<eos> Uh... you probably broke a couple hearts.<eos> And then sewed them back together because you're a doctor.<eos> Uh, it's really just the same old story.<eos> But, uh, this house is great.<eos> When'd you buy it?
I know.<eos> And now I can see why.<eos> My God. Are you okay?<eos> What happened?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I just got called in to the night shift and got into a little tussle with a 4x6.<eos> So, you punched a 4x6?<eos> Imagine my surprise when it punched back.<eos> That's your story?<eos> You're sticking to it?
Gave it a shot.<eos> Okay, I'll let you choose.<eos> Should I be angrier that you had sex in my bed or that you blew me off?<eos> I don't blow people off.<eos> Sex freak it is.<eos> Can you really be mad at me?<eos> No.<eos> You want a glass of wine?<eos> Oh, it sounds lovely, but the bottle's empty.<eos> Norman and I killed it before we got our nasty on.
Okay. Let's do it.<eos> Take back MTV?<eos> Take back the youth-oriented channel from the youth?<eos> Have you been watching your own channel?<eos> It's garbage.<eos> I don't even know what it is.<eos> It's a mess.<eos> Music is dead.<eos> Cable TV has 500 more channels since you were last watching.<eos> But music is dead because you killed it.

Oh, well... you know when the Government passed that law banning people drinking alcohol on public transport?<eos> But, you still get lots of folks on the bus drinking cans of lager, don't yer?<eos> So, if I do go outside...?<eos> Oh, there might be a spot of bother.<eos> Mum, could I have a quick word in private?<eos> OK, just in here.<eos> Right.<eos> By law, I have to give you this.<eos> Well, if you notice Kieren acting strangely at all, it might be a sign that he's...<eos> Well, there's this illegal drug going around, PDS kids are calling it "Blue Oblivion".
Sorry to leave you on your own all day.<eos> I'll put your tea on.<eos> Dicks.<eos> Sorry, love.<eos> Oh, hello there.<eos> Hi. Everything OK?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's just been a long day.<eos> You cold?<eos> You've got my hoodie on. Oh. Do you want it...?
Good luck.<eos> OK Nazif.<eos> We'll be in touch.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> I'll try to get there with Senada if the sister-in-law will give us her insurance card.<eos> She'll do it?<eos> I'll be over in the morning.<eos> I'll borrow a car.<eos> Her life is in question.<eos> So you're sure she'll give it to us?
Now, the West Wing was built by Theodore Roosevelt and was meant to be temporary.<eos> SKIP: Hey, guys.<eos> Welcome to the White House.<eos> Sweet colonnade, right?<eos> It's just Latin for "porch."<eos> Uh... Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Great idea.<eos> We'll take a picture and we'll post it online.
I think you might be underestimating its power.<eos> And you're underestimating you.<eos> The accent didn't change you.<eos> It just gave you the confidence to be the person you already were.<eos> But your name is Oliver, right?<eos> Because that's a deal breaker.<eos> (laughs) Yeah. (laughs)<eos> Very interesting, don't you think?<eos> Look, I think you're getting worked up, all right?<eos> I didn't want this double date, you didn't want it.
I gotta say, guys, it was all teamwork.<eos> We are definitely getting better.<eos> Think we might be catching up to Splinter?<eos> Yeah, maybe soon, we won't need him to train us at all.<eos> Through your eyes, brothers, I finally see the world for what it really is.<eos> This city is infested.<eos> 8 million parasites, Scrambling around in their pointless lives, spreading disease, forcing us to live in the shadows, like vermin.<eos> No more.<eos> They are the true plague.<eos> Together, we shall rid this city of humanity and reclaim it for ourselves.
- That is not your decision to make.<eos> - Why not, sensei?<eos> I've had to make every other decision, and I'm tired of it.<eos> Those guys have no idea what kind of pressure I'm under, and all they do is complain.<eos> Is it too much to ask for a simple thank-you?<eos> Of course it is.<eos> Leadership is not about being appreciated.<eos> It is about responsibility.<eos> It doesn't matter that the burden is heavy.<eos> It matters that you carry it.
Ready, set, go.<eos> 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14,<eos> 13, 12, 11, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.<eos> Lights up.<eos> Well, Chad was too far away.<eos> And Denny was, too.<eos> Rainy couldn't get to Theresa.<eos> None of us made it in time.<eos> Yeah, but... the flag is gone.<eos> Well, who took it then?
You're crushing me, Mom.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> It's Abner.<eos> He--<eos> Oh, son.<eos> It is not uncommon for a dog to let loose a little gas every now and then.<eos> That, my friend, is exactly why we do not feed him people food from the table.<eos> That is wicked.<eos> No, it's not gas.<eos> I created this formula, and Abner drank it, and now he can talk.
You treat everybody here better than me.<eos> Even those witch ladies.<eos> Also not true.<eos> No, it is true. You let...<eos> You take them for walks and you...<eos> As I would take you if your faith required communion with nature.<eos> I don't want to walk!<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm gonna hang this damn cross!<eos> 'Cause it's my religious freedom and you're violating it!
You did win that one for tidiest cubby in preschool.<eos> But the truth is overrated.<eos> My advice, keep her focused on her life outside, her business, her friends.<eos> The wedding.<eos> Whether or not you actually go through with it.<eos> Here, Larry.<eos> Eat your soup.<eos> You're the best soup eater in America.<eos> He's got it!<eos> Find that chicken, babe, you got it?
Here, Larry.<eos> Eat your soup.<eos> You're the best soup eater in America.<eos> He's got it!<eos> Find that chicken, babe, you got it?<eos> Chicken!<eos> Here, chicky, chicky, chicky.<eos> What's going on?<eos> There's $1,000 inside a chicken somewhere.<eos> Everyone's looking for it.
If she hasn't been scared off, the Spanish or the blacks have her.<eos> Those Spanish probably won't even eat her, just cut her throat and drink her blood, or something else superstitious.<eos> All I wanted was to eat the chicken that is smarter than other chickens and to absorb its power.<eos> And make a nice Kiev.<eos> But, oh, well.<eos> So, what?<eos> You're just gonna give up?<eos> Just because of a little competition?<eos> That chicken is out there, Red, and it's waiting for you.<eos> To eat it.
No, you just ate a cake.<eos> You can't eat all the time and we should save money.<eos> Look at the park!<eos> Thanks!<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey, what is this lollipop?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Did you steal it?<eos> - No.<eos> I just took it.
- One mustn't do that!<eos> Don't do this.<eos> Don't steal!<eos> I'm not kidding.<eos> Don't steal lollipops.<eos> Don't be like Claudia.<eos> I'm not kidding.<eos> Neither am I.<eos> You stole a lollipop!<eos> I just took it.
Don't steal!<eos> I'm not kidding.<eos> Don't steal lollipops.<eos> Don't be like Claudia.<eos> I'm not kidding.<eos> Neither am I.<eos> You stole a lollipop!<eos> I just took it.<eos> - Don't laugh at me.<eos> - She took it!
- Does my wife have to know about this?<eos> - It's not my place to tell her.<eos> But we live in Skoga.<eos> I wasn't entirely truthful this morning.<eos> I actually went out to gather twigs for Fanny last night.<eos> I got home at 03:30.<eos> - Did you see Anneli?<eos> - No.<eos> But I saw a white bag on the shoreline.<eos> - I got curious and looked into it.
Everything will come out.<eos> If it weren't for Anneli, Joakim would never have invested.<eos> And then it would have gone to hell for us.<eos> About the forest!<eos> It went like that anyway.<eos> She met her old lover who she was just about to forget.<eos> But this spring, a letter came from the guy in question.<eos> Fortunately, I collected the mail that day.<eos> Then another letter came.<eos> I intercepted it.
Or, uh, at a late-night movie with friends.<eos> Watching TV.<eos> How about you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Probably chasing down some story.<eos> Holed up in a fleabag motel.<eos> I don't think that was anything.<eos> Jeff are we gonna be okay?<eos> We didn't bring this.<eos> But if Stuart Reynolds wants a fight, he's gonna get it.
What's on your mind?<eos> Am I under arrest?<eos> No.<eos> No, not yet.<eos> But if you leave town, that could be a big problem.<eos> You knew, didn't you?<eos> What this thing did.<eos> I knew it was bad luck.<eos> I figured you deserved some.<eos> Did you ever use it?
Hi, my name is Gillian.<eos> Hi, my name's Gillian.<eos> Hi, my name's Gillian and I'm a pretty big...<eos> I'm a... Hi, my name's Gillian and I'm a pretty big Bruce Springsteen fan.<eos> After my first Bruce brought...<eos> Hi. No.<eos> No.<eos> Hi.<eos> My name's Gillian and I'm a pretty big Bruce Springsteen fan.<eos> After my first Bruce concert in April, I was so excited and so full of emotion and I wanted to let Bruce know how important he was to me, so I wrote him a letter, thinking I'd be able to send it to him,

No.<eos> No.<eos> Hi.<eos> My name's Gillian and I'm a pretty big Bruce Springsteen fan.<eos> After my first Bruce concert in April, I was so excited and so full of emotion and I wanted to let Bruce know how important he was to me, so I wrote him a letter, thinking I'd be able to send it to him,<eos> but I couldn't find a fan mail address.<eos> So I wrote it anyway and just put it out there in case I'd ever have the chance to tell him how important he is and his music is in my life.
So I wrote it anyway and just put it out there in case I'd ever have the chance to tell him how important he is and his music is in my life.<eos> So this is the perfect opportunity for that, so I'm going to share that letter now.<eos> Dear Bruce, to say I am a fan of yours would be quite an understatement.<eos> Your music is woven into my very being.<eos> It has become a part of the story of me, turning into a kind of soundtrack of the past couple of years of my life.<eos> I first discovered your music about four years ago.<eos> I heard Glory Days on the radio and I guess it spoke to me and to where I was at that point in my life.<eos> I started looking at more of your songs and my parents were quite amused that I was suddenly listening to music from their time.<eos> But that's the thing, Bruce, your music doesn't have a time or a place.<eos> Your music is a story and it bends and flows into the stories of everyone who listens to it.
I just struggle with the word.<eos> It just gives you, like, no substance.<eos> It's not like, "He was a really nice guy" or, "He was really funny."<eos> It becomes this thing where it's like, "He's famous." And it's just a weird...<eos> I hate it.<eos> When I think about going out, I'm not bothered if it's me, by myself, like, I won't really think about it, but if I'm gonna take my mom, or, like, my little sisters, or whatever, I don't really like them to be exposed to that.<eos> Because I think it's quite weird for them to see all the people's reactions, and especially for my younger sisters.<eos> I don't want them to get confused.<eos> I want them to still think I'm the same person.<eos> One of the reasons why I don't like the word "famous" because then people use it afterwards and they go like, "He used to be famous."
Who asked you, anyway?<eos> First time I tried to do English dinner.<eos> So I've put the feelers out, no-one's heard a thing.<eos> We don't even know what he looks like.<eos> This is my dish.<eos> Well, I'm telling you, if he puts his mind to it, he's going to steal that cross.<eos> Unless someone steals the initiative.<eos> Just get out of my way.<eos> Inspector Valentine, here to escort the Blue Cross to Newbury.<eos> Father Brown already took it.
I wanted beautiful things.<eos> Thou shalt not covet.<eos> They bring so much lightness into the dark.<eos> We're rather suited, priest and thief.<eos> Drawn into the dark. Driven towards sin.<eos> Driven?<eos> What will it take to stop me, Father?<eos> A few prayers?<eos> A dozen Hail Marys?<eos> Assign me some penance, and perhaps I'll return it.
Nie.<eos> Nie!<eos> I reckon the storm caused a surge in the power grid because the whole of Kembleford went ka-blooey last night.<eos> I'm sure I've seen that symbol somewhere before.<eos> Oh, probably Satanists, Father.<eos> And the Lord said, "Let there be light."<eos> Wahey!<eos> "And the light shineth in darkness, "and the darkness recognised it not."
I'll have what she's having.<eos> Heh, and you will. Sooner than you'd think.<eos> We should be ready for human trials in two years' time.<eos> This afternoon.<eos> Preferably in the next half hour. I have a dinner engagement.<eos> I'm sorry, but, uh, well, that's impossible.<eos> I hear you like to get sauced at biochemistry conventions and brag about how you're gonna win the Nobel Prize for the work you're doing here, research that has been entirely funded by my late husbands money.<eos> I have made you rich soon to be famous.<eos> I want that medicine.<eos> I paid for it, and I want it.
How big a hero is my kid brother for taking him out?<eos> Name is Gavin Bryant.<eos> Swanky address.<eos> Well, crime pays.<eos> No criminal record.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, I don't think his gun shoots gumdrops and lollipops.<eos> Well, he had a fully loaded magazine, but nothing in the chamber; gun is clean as a whistle.<eos> Doesn't look like it's been fired recently.<eos> Well, just because he didn't fire it doesn't he didn't use it to commit a crime.
Our marriage was solid.<eos> His business was never better.<eos> He was not suicidal.<eos> Your husband was distraught.<eos> Had he been drinking?<eos> He was 15 years sober.<eos> Had something happened recently?<eos> Why was he... Why was he carrying a gun?<eos> He did volunteer work a few weeks ago in a sketchy neighborhood.<eos> Maybe he had it for protection.
Door slams, you jump out of your skin-<eos> - I don't have PTSD.<eos> Also, irritability.<eos> Yeah, okay, I have a little bit of that.<eos> Headaches, rapid heart rate.<eos> Intrusive thoughts.<eos> Reliving the experience over and over in your head, trying to change the outcome.<eos> The last one, I do that.<eos> You gonna let that pork chop go to waste?<eos> 'Cause if you are, you know, I'll take it off your hands.
The house is a tight fit.<eos> You're gonna find out real fast there are no secrets at Graceland.<eos> - Except for Briggs. - Yeah.<eos> Except for Briggs.<eos> Give me the gun, and get in the car.<eos> This is your last chance.<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> Or what?<eos> You saw the gun?<eos> Yeah, I see it right there.
There's too many moving pieces.<eos> If it got back to Bello, I'd be dead.<eos> But I appreciate the effort.<eos> It's a work in progress.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> Hey, stranger. What you doing home?<eos> Charlie and Mike helped me spike Bobby's drink.<eos> The dreaded spike, huh?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Couldn't get it up, huh?
Yeah.<eos> Thanks, Dad.<eos> Divers found the victim's I.D. in a pocket.<eos> Petty Officer Second Class Luke Grismer.<eos> "Keep this item carefully."<eos> No one's touched the ear since we've been here, Doc.<eos> I was quoting the instructions Vincent Van Gogh gave to a prostitute when he handed her his severed right ear.<eos> Gardez cet objet soigneusement.<eos> What'd he care?<eos> He cut it off.
They'd been watching Coronation Street.<eos> In bed, obviously.<eos> And he described something that happened in the story and Janet's mum -<eos> I checked with my mum and it was definitely last Wednesday's episode.<eos> Did he see her<eos> - Helen?<eos> No.<eos> He didn't but I think there are reasons to take this seriously despite his confusion about Julie.<eos> His first words... were..."There was someone out there on the landing.<eos> If he's making the accusation, we're following it up, I don't care how old or ill he is.
In his flat all night, watching DVDs, playing on his X-Box, sleeping.<eos> I'm getting a cell-site map, see if that can locate him.<eos> What about her?<eos> The missus.<eos> I haven't even said hello to her yet.<eos> She was in Leeds.<eos> She left Manchester 10.00am Saturday stayed over there Saturday and Sunday night<eos> - I'm verifying that.<eos> She's staying with a neighbour in Altrincham.<eos> I've got the address whenever you need it.
Some had fallen away since decomposition, but they were close enough to suggest that's what they were used for<eos> Are you all right?<eos> You know what the forensic archaeologist and Denise said, about how none of them were buried at the same time?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -They were all buried separately.<eos> Even though they're in the same graves.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -We've been blithely talking, like assuming, he filled one grave up and then moved onto the next.<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> You don't dig a grave and leave it open just in case you kill someone else later.
-We think we're being pointed towards Rosie.<eos> And the person who keeps pointing things out is Craig.<eos> He was on duty when Gerald died.<eos> -They both were.<eos> -Craig can inject.<eos> Anyone can.<eos> There's videos on YouTube.<eos> Why did she tell you to get her bag if she knew the syringe was there?<eos> I don't think she knew it was in there.<eos> I think someone, Craig, put it there. Sorry.
Hey, Grandma. Hey.<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> Get over here.<eos> I sure do love the cross you got me.<eos> But do I have to wear it today?<eos> It's kinda hard to close my shirt over it.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> You do whatever you want, padrecito.<eos> I know that's the way in this house.<eos> But if you wear it, ooh, you'll make me proud.
- considering we...<eos> - Joss, I'm not doing this.<eos> It's not worth it.<eos> Wow. Thanks a lot.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> You do not get to be hurt.<eos> Of course I'm hurt.<eos> Alex, you're throwing away our entire relationship. Why?<eos> I was not the one who threw it away.
Yeah?<eos> What section?<eos> - The job is still the job, you know.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, this baby lost its tail a little while ago, just so you know.<eos> Well, I'm a little behind on my homework.<eos> But the point is, I'm gonna be here for you and the baby.<eos> That's really great.<eos> You know, when you didn't respond to my text telling you that the appointment had changed, I thought you just weren't gonna show up again.<eos> When did you change it?
Georgia,<eos> Caroline, Rachel.<eos> Oh, I love it.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Cooper. Oh!<eos> We got the house.<eos> What?<eos> What house?<eos> The perfect house.<eos> Dad wanted to surprise you, but he didn't think we would get it.
(Sighs) Lord, am I beat.<eos> I forget how being on, uh, your feet all day can really take it out of ya.<eos> (Grunts) You barely finish up with one patient before another one needs ya. (Shoes thud) (Sighs) We need to hire a nanny.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> The deal was you'd stay home with the kids and I'd go back to work.<eos> I'm not changing things just 'cause you had a rough day. Ah. Run.<eos> You see this shirt?<eos> I don't know if these stains are vomit or breast milk anymore because I've been wearing it for five days.
Mum...it's me.<eos> When you get this message, I don't want you to worry.<eos> People are gonna say things.<eos> I don't want you to listen to them.<eos> I don't want you to believe them.<eos> Things are just a bit mixed up, that's all.<eos> I'll be home soon.<eos> So you look after yourself.<eos> My computer got nicked, at school.<eos> I left it in a bag and then it was gone.
Glenn, Carl, the baby, whoever else is left.<eos> He'll save Rick for last so he can watch his family and friends die ugly.<eos> That's who you're dealing with.<eos> This is Mrs. McLeod.<eos> She's the one with arthritis.<eos> Well, thank you, dear, but we'll find another way you can help us.<eos> Noah's asthmatic.<eos> You ever shoot a gun, son?<eos> I had a BB gun once.<eos> My mom took it away.
You're still alive.<eos> All right.<eos> Shit!<eos> All right.<eos> All right. Okay.<eos> Michonne.<eos> Hershel told me about the boy you shot.<eos> He had a gun.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Was he handing it over?
All right.<eos> All right. Okay.<eos> Michonne.<eos> Hershel told me about the boy you shot.<eos> He had a gun.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Was he handing it over?<eos> - He had just attacked us. - Yeah.<eos> Yes, he had.<eos> Was he handing it over?
What a pity it is that the gods have favored you with ten sons and not a single daughter.<eos> But Gaspar, have you forgotten that I have daughter called Zara?<eos> Forgive me, Lord Haman, but she is but a child.<eos> That was yesterday.<eos> You know children, they grow up so quickly.<eos> Quickly enough for marriage?<eos> Indeed!<eos> You must take this proposal to the king at once.<eos> No, no, no, I'm far too modest to make such a proposal myself.<eos> No, no, that is why I'm relying upon you to make it for me.
Yes, I agree.<eos> And I'm Bert.<eos> - I am Burt!<eos> Work!<eos> - Working!<eos> Ali Hi Hello, hello.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> - I'm concerned.<eos> If leaked, tell me to shut up.<eos> Say: "Shut your damn mouth or I'll shut it for you!"
I got it right here.<eos> They could have killed him, they didn't.<eos> They want something.<eos> Confirmed identities of who were dealing with.<eos> Charles Mead, the man who abducted Claire Matthews, is one.<eos> The other is Louise Sinclair out of New Orleans, former Blackwater operative.<eos> Another overachiever.<eos> Find out if she ran the plates yet.<eos> We put out an APB in a 300-mile radius of Richmond.<eos> If it's out there, we'll find it.
And when his cecum explodes,<eos> - what happens to his preload then?<eos> - Do you ladies even need me for this?<eos> Uh, well, yes, Joel, because you're the chief, and we need a medical opinion.<eos> My medical opinion is...<eos> I think you should tag team.<eos> By that, I mean you should do both your surgeries at the same time.<eos> I'm not sharing the O.R. with her.<eos> Fine. You just asked me my opinion.<eos> I gave it to you.
You might want to start by asking me my last name.<eos> I know that your last name is Sullivan.<eos> I looked at your chart.<eos> Very observant.<eos> And, um... what else have you observed about me?<eos> I have observed that you are a terrific mother.<eos> Very good. And?<eos> I... also... Oh. Too long of a pause.<eos> Okay, um, I'm a social worker, but I don't have a bleeding heart.<eos> And I have a motorcycle, but I haven't driven it since Ryan was born.
Seriously?<eos> Yeah, hell, why not?<eos> Larry can do it. How hard can it be?<eos> [ cellphone buttons clicking ] Hey, Larry, it's Charlie.<eos> Yeah, how's the kid doing?<eos> Good.<eos> Listen, um, I'm going to use the pump to do a circ arrest with Dr. Bell.<eos> Think you can talk me through it?<eos> Pump is primed and circulated.<eos> I'll run it, you hook it up.
Previously on Grimm.<eos> The Captain is the one who woke Juliette up, okay?<eos> Which means he's the one who saved her life.<eos> Just saw the Captain looking through your desk drawer.<eos> The Captain took something that belongs to me.<eos> If they have no control over what's going on, if it's all about this spell, there's no reason to do anything crazy.<eos> I brought the key.<eos> Here.<eos> I'm giving it back to you.
Pretty much everything.<eos> And he's on board with that?<eos> He's working it out.<eos> Okay, probably better that way.<eos> What about Adalind?<eos> She wants the key.<eos> For my brother.<eos> Why don't you give it to her?<eos> Because I trust you more than I trust my family.<eos> There's way too much at stake to let either one of them have it.
You know, if you want to deal with this down at the precinct, I can make that happen for you.<eos> I told you everything I know, which is nothing.<eos> Now, what do you want?<eos> I want to know who's going around killing innocent people, and I think you can help me find out who did it.<eos> Innocent?<eos> That's right.<eos> There is nothing innocent about what we do to this planet.<eos> Now, if somebody wanted to do something about that, well, then, I applaud their courage.<eos> So you condone this behavior?<eos> If somebody broke into your house and set it on fire, wouldn't you have the right, under the law, to kill that person?
Okay.<eos> We got what we came for, didn't we?<eos> Let's hope so.<eos> Hey, listen, Danny.<eos> I'm all caught up on my cases, I got nothing going on the next couple of days.<eos> I'm happy to go overtime, take the load off of you.<eos> That's okay.<eos> That's okay.<eos> I can't even begin to understand what you're going through.<eos> But the option is there if you want it.
- Hi Enrico.<eos> - Good night dear.<eos> - Do you need anything?<eos> - No.<eos> So I am going out...<eos> see you tomorrow.<eos> About the appointments?<eos> This afternoon I have something to do, cancel all obligations.<eos> This venue really sucks!<eos> Whoever designed it?
Final-- and they were like,<eos> "hee hee!<eos> I did too many drugs.<eos> And when I say I did 'em, I fuckin' did 'em.<eos> I didn't experiment with them.<eos> You know when people say, "oh, yeah, when I was in my Late teens and 20s, I experimented with drugs"?<eos> No, you fuckin' didn't.<eos> You're not a scientist.<eos> You didn't experiment with 'em.<eos> And experiment is you get a white coat, You get the drug, you feed it to the dog, You film it, you put it on youtube.
Told security to have him meet us near the rope line.<eos> His name is Jones.<eos> This guy?<eos> Yo. You Jones?<eos> I'm Jones.<eos> Scarlet Jones.<eos> Detectives Ryan and Esposito.<eos> NYPD. You were supposed to have eyes on Beau. So what happened?<eos> Beau told me to wait outside with the car.<eos> When your boss gives you a directive, you follow it.
Not everything.<eos> For instance, you didn't tell us that you had been working for Mr. Randolph for only a couple of weeks.<eos> How is that relevant?<eos> Well, in your statement, you said that when Beau went into the club, you stayed with the limo.<eos> That's right. That's what I did.<eos> So then maybe you can explain this.<eos> That appears to be you stealing an SD card.<eos> And before you say "evil twin," just know-- It's been done.<eos> You broke in to his office just after he died using his key card.<eos> How did you get it?

You broke in to his office just after he died using his key card.<eos> How did you get it?<eos> Look, I didn't kill Beau, and certainly not for his key card.<eos> He left it in the limo.<eos> I knew it was my only chance.<eos> What do you mean, only chance?<eos> There was this... sex tape.<eos> This friend of mine made the mistake of sleeping with Beau, and he videotaped it.<eos> She knew that if it ever got out, it would destroy her life, so I took this job to make sure the tape never got out.<eos> When Beau told me to stay with the car, I knew it was my only shot, so, yes, I-I broke into his office, I took the SD card and I destroyed it.
They seemed to like his offer.<eos> I was just looking for some leverage.<eos> I just needed something to make him back off.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> 'Cause given everything you've already done, it would've been easy to hire someone to slip into that party and just make it go away.<eos> I had nothing to do with his death.<eos> But I might know who did.<eos> Scarlet... said he guarded this SD card with his life.<eos> Now I know why.<eos> I thought I could use it as leverage against Randolph, but, uh, well, now it's pretty clear he was using it to blackmail someone else.
That's why you decided that you couldn't let it happen.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> When we found out you had motive, we took a look at your footage.<eos> Yeah, and you saw that I was filming all night, including while Beau was being killed.<eos> Actually, your camera was filming, but you weren't.<eos> Normally the footage from a hand-held camera would be in motion.<eos> And yours was in motion, except for from 11:50 to 11:58-- About the time Beau headed to the bathroom.<eos> For those eight minutes, the footage was rock-steady.<eos> You put your camera on a tripod and you walked away.<eos> You left it running, knowing that that would give you an alibi.
Stay in the building.<eos> No vamp-running in the hallways.<eos> Vamp-running from what?<eos> - Turn. - What?<eos> You can't.<eos> He'll lose control.<eos> That's the whole point.<eos> I've exhausted all your knowledge.<eos> Now I have the Professor to help me find the cure, you're just competition.<eos> Whoever finds it first gets to decide what to do with it:
And went off with the real cola.<eos> Do we need to notice him? A mustache kiss.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> This one is a bit longer. Slowly.<eos> Stop.<eos> Hi,thisis Michael.<eos> First I, then beep, then you<eos> Oh man, voicemail again.<eos> Here is your favorite Helen.<eos> If you are looking for your Coke can, uh, we have it.
Just go.<eos> And be on time tomorrow.<eos> Valerie... weonlywantedtosaytoyou that we'd like to thank you for the last two years and the 175 night shifts, you've taken... Thank you .<eos> And all the best for your birthday and... Hello, Spacko.<eos> I need a pizza.<eos> Yes, a spinach pizza and a six pack At the Hilf...<eos> Maria Hilf Hospital.<eos> Room 265 Did you write that down?<eos> All right.<eos> If the pizza is cold, I'll shove it up your ass.
- No doubt.<eos> I'm 5 minutes behind you, man.<eos> Just go.<eos> I said go home.<eos> What's the crime?<eos> Working late?<eos> Wait.<eos> I got something.<eos> Watch.<eos> You see how he picks up the bag, he scoops it with his forearm?
Will!<eos> I'm gonna kill you!<eos> Get off me!<eos> It's Meg's.<eos> I know, mate.<eos> I know.<eos> Meg Jackson's bracelet has been found in your possession.<eos> Can you explain why?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Someone put it there.
- Michael's hand.<eos> That's some kind of training model, right?<eos> Something to get him used to the system until--<eos> I don't know.<eos> Something better?<eos> There is no better.<eos> That's it.<eos> Look, Michael came to me with the same question.<eos> I had to give him the same answer.<eos> Now, he didn't like it, but he accepted it.
Elliott Belk was living there at the time.<eos> Palermo, 2001.<eos> A British tourist found dead in a hotel room under Elliott's name.<eos> Both of them had their arms broken.<eos> And these are just a few that we know about.<eos> You might as well add that private investigator to the list.<eos> We're thinking Elliott went back to Kasper's office to get rid of any evidence collected against him, found Daniella there.<eos> So, this is what we know about Elliott:<eos> He likes to break people's arms while they're still alive, which probably makes him a sadist, which means he gets a thrill from seeing his victims in pain, so he'll want to see Daniella alive until he gets that thrill.<eos> What if she doesn't give it to him?
I want to talk to you about Walter.<eos> Right around Christmas, when he...disappeared, he gave me this.<eos> This is your father's notebook.<eos> He kept a list of all the people in Starling City who owed him favors.<eos> I had...no idea there was so many of them.<eos> I've just been researching some of those names online, and, um, they're not good people.<eos> Oliver, I have no idea what your father was involved in or with whom.<eos> And you and your sister both now know that he wasn't exactly honest with me.<eos> Then we need to find out-- no.<eos> If what you say is true and this list is filled with bad people and Walter was looking into it, and now he--
Oh, sweetie, wow!<eos> This is unbelievable.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Well, it was gonna be a surprise.<eos> You know, I kind of got the feeling from our phone conversation that you wanted to keep the flower shop.<eos> Oh, God, you see?<eos> That's why I love you so much.<eos> Stupid Peter and my stupid parents.<eos> They don't get me at all.<eos> Well, that's why I bought it back for you.
Full of shit.<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> - I told her.<eos> - Told her what?<eos> That Mike Ross is a fraud, and I am not going to let him get away with it.<eos> How could you do this?<eos> You did this to yourself.<eos> How long are you going to keep staring at that offer?<eos> Until one of us blinks.<eos> Deron signed it.
I don't need to record you.<eos> This letter was printed from your hard drive, which has your computer's digital signature.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I wanna know, if you had the chance, would you have traded that car to get your parents back together?<eos> That's a stupid goddamn question, and you know it.<eos> I never had that chance, so what does it matter?<eos> Because I do.<eos> What do I want?<eos> I wanna give this office back.<eos> I didn't earn it, I don't want it, and if there's a chance it'll help Harvey forgive me, I'm gonna take it.
I sent the card to Ivy.<eos> But...<eos> Jimmy said...<eos> He didn't send one.<eos> Or, if he did, it wasn't to anyone at Downton.<eos> Good night, Mrs Patmore.<eos> If it weren't him, then who did send my card?<eos> I won't sleep now.<eos> Oh, for heaven's sake!<eos> I sent it.
Don't worry, I'll deal with it.<eos> You can't do anything.<eos> What?<eos> What do you mean I can't?<eos> I mean... Honey.<eos> Focus the energy here.<eos> Right here.<eos> Do you feel it?<eos> Yes...<eos> I think I feel it.
And you have questions.<eos> Just one actually.<eos> What are you fighting them for?<eos> Resources, territory?<eos> A flower -- the Catarius.<eos> It blooms on my homeland when the weather begins to warm.<eos> A flower that is... So valuable that it's caused an intergalactic war?<eos> The Catarius has no value to anyone except me.<eos> Something you remember from your childhood?<eos> Actually, I have never seen it.
I can do that.<eos> Renard.<eos> No bullet wounds, no shell casings, no weapons in evidence.<eos> Looks like it was hand-to-hand.<eos> Very old school.<eos> Any witnesses?<eos> - Not that we know of. - Huh.<eos> Surveillance cameras?<eos> No, not covering this area.<eos> Somebody picked it well.
I'm hoping she'll talk to you.<eos> You okay?<eos> You want to talk about this?<eos> I really don't.<eos> Who shot the gun?<eos> I did.<eos> Why?<eos> I thought I saw an intruder.<eos> Where's the gun?<eos> He took it with him.
I found this total amaze-balls case for us!<eos> Maybe a topic for conversation at a more non-naked time, Kenzi.<eos> I'm... sorry.<eos> - Hi!<eos> How are you?<eos> - I was great.<eos> As we speak, humans are dying.<eos> They're going all gloopy, slipping into slime, liquefying on their loved ones.<eos> They need our help, Bo.<eos> And they need it stat.
There's- There's a woman crying in the doorway.<eos> None of these clues were supposed to exist- the cell phone video, the photos of the admiral and his sheep.<eos> The killers were meant to disappear without a trace.<eos> The family had called them "American Taliban."<eos> But who were they, these American soldiers with beards?<eos> As a reporter, you learn that every story has conflicting points of view.<eos> You try to understand all of them without letting your own get in the way.<eos> But there was something about this story and the way it was covered up.<eos> The photo of the admiral had seemed to answer our questions about the raid.<eos> But the longer I looked at it, the less sense it made.
President Obama personally intervening to keep a respected Yemeni journalist in prison.<eos> It sounded far-fetched to me.<eos> But then I found this on the White House's own website, a readout from a phone call between Obama and the Yemeni president.<eos> They badly misspelled Abdulelah's name, but Obama's point was clear.<eos> He wanted him kept in jail.<eos> Al-Majalah was the first reported strike inside Yemen in seven years.<eos> It was clearly a U.S. Cruise missile that struck the Bedouin camp.<eos> Since there was no declared war in Yemen, I knew the strike was either JSOC or the CIA.<eos> And then I found this photo.<eos> The U.S. would have never released it, but Yemen's president posted it on his personal website- a presidential meeting with an important American guest, the head of the Joint Special Operations Command,
Social media is actually rooting for Liber8.<eos> Kiera, are you there?<eos> This is Cameron.<eos> Yeah, I know that.<eos> What is with the connection?<eos> That's actually why I'm calling.<eos> I've been experiencing this interference issue.<eos> Kiera, listen.<eos> Do you remember the night that you landed?<eos> Unlikely I'd forget it.
Leave. Wow.<eos> Kellogg really knows how to bait a hook.<eos> Nice upgrade.<eos> So what is it about this girl?<eos> Is she one of the suspects?<eos> Maybe, maybe not.<eos> So you really think this girl murdered all those people just to get back at her dad?<eos> It feels like a stretch but there's... something about her.<eos> So I did some research on melamine, it's actually toxic stuff.<eos> They banned it after they found it in baby formula, plastic toys, animal feed...
Not my keeper.<eos> I worry about you.<eos> These people...<eos> These people have emancipated themselves from the slavery of the system.<eos> Your system.<eos> It's the same story every time, Hannah.<eos> Please...<eos> Please let me help you.<eos> I don't want your help!<eos> I don't need it!
I brought you some more books.<eos> And... Your father's journals, like you asked.<eos> And look. That day, in that building, five top executives from big pharmaceutical companies were meeting.<eos> Executives who were in competition with each other, all five of the companies have denied that the meeting even took place until life insurance policies on the dead executives were paid out.<eos> It's all over the news.<eos> So what, they were colluding?<eos> Suppressing cures to some medicine.<eos> This is just the tip of the iceberg.<eos> Kagame, he told me that the truth would reveal itself.<eos> And you revealed it.
I had to put up with brutes like them when I served in the Emperor's army... fools who think we have no business holding a sword.<eos> I only wish there was someone there to stand up for me. Oh.<eos> You're, uh, you're bleeding.<eos> I'll survive.<eos> The sun should be setting soon.<eos> We need to move out.<eos> What... what... what do you mean, "we"?<eos> You tracked the yaoguai in a matter of hours.<eos> It took me weeks.<eos> You track the beast, and I'll kill it.
Peggy Lee.<eos> Oh, Capitol Records' own, sweetheart, and a personal friend of mine.<eos> "Ira Styne, East Coast Junior VP, Radio Promotions, Geneva Records"?<eos> Listen, I've got a panel swinging on the smaller markets in about five minutes.<eos> Now, Peggy Lee-- she's singing at the Atlantis for a lunch thing.<eos> Come by, 1:00.<eos> You should meet her.<eos> I'll even introduce you to the whole Capitol team.<eos> Really meet Peggy Lee?<eos> Well, let me have your music. I'll give it a listen, get it in front of the right ears. And who knows?
Colt.<eos> - How'd it go?<eos> - Fine.<eos> Baby.<eos> He got a little ornery.<eos> Nothing I can't handle.<eos> Ornery?<eos> Well, he's a man used to having the upper hand.<eos> Took him a little while to accept his situation.<eos> But he did? He accepted it?
How you killed Ellen May...<eos> you put a bullet right in her brain.<eos> Yeah, and, well, she didn't feel a thing.<eos> What kind of gun did you use?<eos> The .45.<eos> Back of the head.<eos> She's so small and light, it nearly blew it clear off.<eos> Can I see it?<eos> You didn't dump it?<eos> Hell no, I didn't dump it.
I lost my father too.<eos> I know it can be... confusing.<eos> But I also know that what happened between us was real.<eos> - Norman--<eos> - Just let me finish.<eos> There's no point hiding from it anymore.<eos> I know how we feel about each other.<eos> I know we're both just scared and confused.<eos> I know we have a connection.<eos> You know, 'cause I can feel it.
Okay, well, if you can't smoke, I've got these killer weed cupcakes.<eos> - Do you want one?<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> Just put the joint out, or I'm gonna lose my job, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks. I appreciate it.<eos> So this sentence here.<eos> "He felt like he was choking inside on some black smoke."<eos> That... I love... I love that image.<eos> But I think it would be better if you just moved it to the end of the paragraph.
What I'm saying is that, what is the likelihood that she'll ever know?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Matt... it's the end of the day.<eos> What are the details of the open house tomorrow? I was thinking I could bake some cookies, give the place that fresh-baked smell.<eos> What?<eos> Um... There's not gonna be an open house.<eos> Why not?<eos> Look, Norma, I looked into it, and there's no market for your property, not with the new bypass road going in.<eos> I can't get you your money back.<eos> Well, how much can you sell it for?
Put him back together again?<eos> What makes you think i needed to?<eos> You took a 40-year-old man who'd never been married-- a man who doesn't believe in something unless he can see it-- and you made him believe in the one and only thing no one can ever see.<eos> What's that?<eos> Love.<eos> And what makes you think love can't be seen?<eos> What makes you think it can?<eos> Because i've seen it.<eos> In post-its filled with poems, stuck on my bathroom mirror.<eos> And in a yellow tack given to me every single year on my birthday, knowing that wherever i stick it on the map, that's exactly where we're gonna wake up the next morning.
Hank's phone just turned on.<eos> We got a solid signal.<eos> Where?<eos> Grand central.<eos> He knows we're tracking his phone.<eos> He's leading us right to her.<eos> You've got the fbi and the shepherds after you.<eos> You just gonna create another identity and disappear?<eos> No.<eos> I'm gonna go to strasbourg, And I am gonna find the true cross And I'm gonna destroy it.
That can't be it.<eos> I thought it was supposed to tell us Where the true cross is?<eos> Matthias.<eos> The 13th apostle.<eos> Hidden inside the clock All those years.<eos> If you don't mind, I'll take it.<eos> I said i'll take it.<eos> Paige, what are you doing?<eos> You went off the rails, girl.<eos> Shepherds gave you a life with meaning, And you pissed it away.
Previously on "zero hour"...<eos> I am gonna find the true cross And I'm gonna destroy it.<eos> Come with me.<eos> I'm confident to have the cross in my possession Within the week.<eos> I've seen things, dad-<eos> A nazi officer with my face.<eos> He looked exactly like me.<eos> I dream about a man with a gun.<eos> The location of the cross must be secret.<eos> I will not put it in the mud.
Now sturm and that guy were at sea for a year Leading up to 1938, Supposedly doing some kind of naval surveys in the north<eos> Where they did extensive land surveys Of the northernmost tip of the main island.<eos> They were calling it scouts for locations To hide naval bases.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Probably hiding something else.<eos> Listen, e-mail me the surveys as soon as you can.<eos> I can't talk to you.<eos> I answered only to tell you to stop.<eos> We're going after the cross.<eos> I swear to you that the pyrates will never get it.
There's nothing you coulda done, buddy.<eos> Marty is schvitzing in the big steam room in the sky now.<eos> (Tessa) George wasn't the only one who had blindsided.<eos> I can't believe Ryan lied... to me.<eos> And you're just as guilty.<eos> You let me believe that he was at an away game instead of... wherever he was.<eos> Tessa, when you first started dating my brother, you put me in a very awkward place.<eos> You think you know somebody.<eos> You wear their letterman jacket.<eos> You put your tongue on top of their tongue and you move it around, only to find out that they are a lying liar who lies their lies directly to your face.
So glad you're here.<eos> Is Daddy coming too?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Me neither.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Alright. I'll see you later.<eos> I've really messed up, Mom.<eos> - No, you haven't.<eos> Happiness is within your reach.<eos> I lost it.
Let's get her back.<eos> Okay.<eos> Tragic and shocking turn of events at the Gerry Roberts financial fraud trial.<eos> Police escorting Roberts from the courtroom<eos> - were attacked by masked men...<eos> - Great.<eos> - who then kidnapped Roberts at gunpoint.<eos> - We're all over the news.<eos> How'd they figure out the exit route?<eos> We changed it every day.
A stretch.<eos> Let's finish this game and call it a day, okay?<eos> Okay, Mr. Young.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How are you feeling today?<eos> I'm gonna run a few more tests, okay?<eos> Hey, look at me for a sec.<eos> You've got that look in your eyes.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I had that look, your father had it.
But I did not sign this paper lightly. I did not sign this without using my head.<eos> I'm not some man reacting out of rage and then thinking later.<eos> I am a woman.<eos> So I thought about it and I made my decision.<eos> Someone shot Fitz three times, someone shot Hal, they killed Britta Kagen, and Hollis orchestrated it.<eos> And now he's sitting pretty in the White House at the right hand of her majesty Sally Langston, whispering his dirt into her ears.<eos> That is not okay.<eos> And because we let that snake Hollis play in our garden for so long, we can't turn him in to the feds or turn him over to the cops or to the courts and wait for justice to be served, because we have to protect Fitz.<eos> We have to protect secrets.<eos> We all got in bed with the devil together and nobody wants to go to federal prison, so I wrote a letter and I signed it.
I hate Serbia.<eos> But at least I'll get some work done on the plane.<eos> Lost?<eos> Cut myself.<eos> Going to medical.<eos> You're about 12 floors off.<eos> What does Amanda have on you?<eos> What does she have?<eos> She has my loyalty.<eos> She's always had it.
Because you keeping building it up so much.<eos> Exactly. What's to say it won't be a big disappointment?<eos> Well, at least then we'll know.<eos> Kens.<eos> What's in the box?<eos> No.<eos> The stakes are too high.<eos> You know it's not going to change anything, right?<eos> We're still talking about the box, right?<eos> It's almost as if you sent it to yourself so we could have this exact conversation.
Well, at least then we'll know.<eos> Kens.<eos> What's in the box?<eos> No.<eos> The stakes are too high.<eos> You know it's not going to change anything, right?<eos> We're still talking about the box, right?<eos> It's almost as if you sent it to yourself so we could have this exact conversation.<eos> Oh, my God, you're diabolical.<eos> You did send it to yourself, didn't you?
No, that was very dramatic, Mr. Beale.<eos> It's just that... we make a good team.<eos> We make an awesome team.<eos> But I don't know, what if I do?<eos> Do what?<eos> Leave Ops some day.<eos> It's not happening any time soon.<eos> I have a long way to go before I can keep up with guys like Callen and Sam, but it's...<eos> You're gonna get your chance.<eos> And when you do, I'll be the first one to tell you to take it.
Thank you so much.<eos> - Helen.<eos> - Hello, Daniel.<eos> Do you have the Stonehaven prospectus in front of you?<eos> Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.<eos> The question is, why?<eos> Consider it a gift.<eos> This time next quarter, that company is poised to triple its revenues, only they don't know it yet.<eos> Oh, but you do?<eos> Why else would I recommend you acquire it?
He's good.<eos> I'll give him that.<eos> $1.2 million?<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I was a little off.<eos> $1.2 million.<eos> Okay, Ben, Ben, listen to me.<eos> Okay, I will get you that card back.<eos> I promise.<eos> I will get you that card, and you will sell it, and your toes will never touch Montana grass.
Are those silk?<eos> Yeah. I like the way they breathe.<eos> Nice.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You ripped us off.<eos> (Chuckling) Oh, you two.<eos> Look, unless you've discovered another priceless collectible, beat it.<eos> Give me my card back.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, you mean my card.<eos> See, you sold it to me.
Wait.<eos> Oh, she's your sister.<eos> Okay, you're in.<eos> Yes.<eos> Savannah:<eos> Guys! Oh, you guys, swindell is on his way.<eos> He's coming from the...<eos> You already knew that, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You had the card in your hand, Griffin, and then you put it back?
Yes.<eos> Savannah:<eos> Guys! Oh, you guys, swindell is on his way.<eos> He's coming from the...<eos> You already knew that, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You had the card in your hand, Griffin, and then you put it back?<eos> Yeah, man, hey, why are we going through all this trouble if you're just gonna choke?<eos> I had a better idea.<eos> Swindell would've known exactly who took it.
What are you talking about?<eos> You're crazy.<eos> You have a good night.<eos> What's up, B?<eos> We need to toast to the madness that was today.<eos> Madness, huh?<eos> B, check it out.<eos> I got sliced up by this mad Russian.<eos> I got this dope scar, though.<eos> I'm working it tonight.
Are we making a buy?<eos> No.<eos> Not with me, you're not.<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> Get out of the car.<eos> What's going on, Charlie?<eos> You like this place?<eos> It's okay.<eos> You know, this house can be yours.<eos> They're not gonna sell it to somebody like me.
No.<eos> But three weeks ago she was looking through this album and she kept bringing up Galliano, and Kate, people ruined by scandal.<eos> She said there were things in her past nobody knew about.<eos> She was worried about getting fired from that TV show.<eos> Why?<eos> Insecurity.<eos> These models, we make them out to be goddesses, but at heart they're nervous little girls.<eos> There's a picture missing here.<eos> It was there when Nina was looking through the album.<eos> Maybe she took it. What was it?
A staged accident.<eos> An accident involving Katherine's car.<eos> So maybe the Cobergs have found a cheap way out of an expensive divorce.<eos> A staged accident?<eos> You guys are nuts.<eos> I've never been to this place.<eos> Not according to your phone.<eos> Then arrest my phone.<eos> Maybe it was there, but I wasn't.<eos> The track and the 1,000 acres surrounding it were bought in 1954 by a subsidiary of Caravelle.

There are only about, uh, 600 bottles left in the world.<eos> And Jack was in no mood to sell?<eos> No, he wanted to put that case on auction.<eos> This is a fair offer.<eos> You will take it.<eos> At auction, this will go for a hell of a lot more.<eos> Jack was right.<eos> Marc offered him $200,000.<eos> When it went on auction, it made over a million.<eos> Who bought it?
Damn it!<eos> Still not answering.<eos> Let's just wait and see what my guys come up with.<eos> Well, I know what broke the table.<eos> It's got blood on it.<eos> Looks like transfer from a hand.<eos> There's no tissue or any other blood around, so it wasn't used as a weapon.<eos> I think someone came through the door with their hands already bloody.<eos> Would account for the smear on the knob.<eos> At some point, they grabbed this thing, maybe out of anger or to intimidate, and they threw it through the table.
Davari was making his own labels.<eos> Looks like he was using spices to enhance the flavor.<eos> Make it taste more like the wine he was trying to mimic.<eos> Well, with his world-class palate, I bet he was pretty good at it.<eos> Doing his own bottling, too.<eos> Got a corking machine.<eos> Think I found how Jack Davari got that hole in his hand.<eos> Somebody wiped that down. Mm-hmm.<eos> Missed a spot.<eos> I'll take a picture and send it to Mandy.
Like that's any of your business.<eos> It is my business if your romantic yearnings are clouding your judgment as a police officer.<eos> If you're trying to touch a nerve, then you're touching me in the wrong place.<eos> Then you're either a donkey, or you're an accomplice.<eos> And I don't think you're a donkey.<eos> I won't answer any more questions without my union rep.<eos> Well, then, your career ends here.<eos> Because you'll be charged as an accessory after the fact.<eos> What fact?<eos> If you had any proof of wrongdoings, then you'd show it.
I have Judy's sister coming in.<eos> We have to find the girls.<eos> How much longer do you need to be standing here.<eos> Shouldn't we be out there looking?<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi, Karen.<eos> No, nothing yet.<eos> All right, thanks.<eos> So, he does own a 12-gauge shotgun.<eos> The police catalogued it a year ago.
Caffrey, I think I know what Peter found.<eos> Be right there.<eos> Whenever a builder alters plans to a site, He has to file one of these change orders With city planning.<eos> These are all from Edwards' projects.<eos> These are all for changes in materials used for construction.<eos> Multiple change orders is a red flag for fraud.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Look at where the ink bled And the date on the change order underneath it.<eos> January 21, 2010.<eos> So they stamped it and filed it away before the ink was dry.
He kept the murder weapon on him?<eos> In an old whiskey box.<eos> It was his way of showing that he was untouchable. But I was adamant, and, uh, eventually, he relented and said that he'd let me out if I did one last job.<eos> Neil:<eos> What was it? Sam:<eos> He told me that my supervising officer would have it.<eos> But when I got there, I thought they were gonna kill me.<eos> Everyone not in the family is disposable to them, after all, including my supervising officer.<eos> They'd killed him with my spare firearm.<eos> They'd stolen it out of my locker. Ellen:
Neal!<eos> Neal.<eos> [ Grunting ] Diana:<eos> FBI! Jones: On the ground!<eos> Man:<eos> FBI! Check it!<eos> I'm gonna check on Peter.<eos> Dennis Flynn Jr., you're under arrest for intent to distribute counterfeit items and attempted murder and whatever crimes you may have committed with this weapon.<eos> You planted that gun.<eos> I've never seen it before in my life.
I sound a little like Abby, don't I?<eos> She can fix it later.<eos> It's weird doing this stuff without her, isn't it?<eos> It's like going to a puppet show, except all the puppets are just laying there on the stage... just dead puppets.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Why are you sorry?<eos> Just...<eos> My father dies, and all of a sudden you cannot talk to me about dead puppets?<eos> I'm fine, Tony.<eos> Why would anyone have a nice notebook like this in their car and never use it?
I have friends who only call me Kenneth.<eos> Jody, you know what he calls me?<eos> "Kennet" without the diphthong.<eos> I bet you're wondering if he's here.<eos> He isn't. I haven't seen him since, an hour ago?<eos> This doesn't sound like any of my business.<eos> So...<eos> Jody left you a movie he's starring in.<eos> If you're Raylan.<eos> He wants me to see it?

No, that's not why I'm here.<eos> But we're not happy about it, either.<eos> John and I only said yes to this dinner 'cause we figured that you'd kill it.<eos> We need to work on our good cop/bad cop. So what's up?<eos> I was wondering if maybe you wanted to get out of here, go have some fun.<eos> Would this involve heels?<eos> Could.<eos> So you have a Frida Kahlo letter and you want to sell it?<eos> If it's actually worth anything.<eos> My dad gave it to me.
Apartheid protest, 1988.<eos> - Patricia was a badass.<eos> - Maybe back then.<eos> Wait.<eos> I don't believe this.<eos> That's James Palmer next to her.<eos> Who?<eos> Barnes' court clerk.<eos> He and Patricia were friends.<eos> Which means, if she did write the letter, whoever killed Palmer believed he wrote it, not her.
He seemed quite upset.<eos> A man in his position learns to keep his temper to himself.<eos> Last I checked, migraines don't cause bruising.<eos> Victoria mentioned that I'm close with David Clarke's daughter Amanda.<eos> After... she lost her father, Amanda was... forced into the foster care system.<eos> She ended up in a number of abusive homes.<eos> That letter gave her the hope she needed to survive.<eos> The thing is, she thought it was written by James Palmer.<eos> No, it wasn't.<eos> He wouldn't have left it unsigned.
Three days before his death...<eos> That secret came out in a letter written to Mr. Clarke in federal prison.<eos> "Dear Mr. Clarke, I'm afraid you have suffered a grave injustice."<eos> Patricia.<eos> Robert.<eos> "My position has provided me "unparalleled access to the system.<eos> Judge Barnes has failed you, Mr. Clarke, as have I."<eos> You see, what James knew is what Judge Barnes knew, which is that the verdict rendered in the David Clarke trial came from a tainted jury.<eos> I believe that this letter cost James the ultimate price.<eos> But James didn't write it.
- My mom lost her job.<eos> - We cannot have her living here.<eos> She's gonna take control of everything.<eos> Where's the vending machine?<eos> They took it away last June.
I just wanted you for myself for a while.<eos> Pinky Tuscadero?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, and The Fonz?<eos> I love her.<eos> You're The Fonz.<eos> Heyyy.<eos> I can get you a leather jacket.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Will you wear it?
- Get in the house!<eos> I slit slipped out of my hands.<eos> Get into your room, please, right now.<eos> God.<eos> Aw, she'll really appreciate that.<eos> The noise and the breeze help her to sleep.<eos> That's great, honey.<eos> I really want her to think she's on a cruise ship while she's here so she doesn't leave.<eos> Crosby, I know you're not happy about the situation, but you really don't have to take it out on me.<eos> Who should I take it out on?
That's it.<eos> She works with the Shepherds.<eos> "352 irrelevant"?<eos> What does that mean? 352?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It meant something to Laila.<eos> It means we're getting closer.<eos> We will find her.<eos> I need to know what this is all about, Father Mark.<eos> For thousands of years, Shepherds have struggled to protect the cross from those who covet it...
No.<eos> See, Sebastian's a Jehovah's Witness - and objects on religious grounds. (Vanessa) Ahh.<eos> How does Sebastian know when to go back into the class?<eos> He just waits for a real inconvenient time to ring the doorbell a hundred times?<eos> Okay, well, you know, I would love to stay, but, uh... Oh, who am I kidding?<eos> Boyd, come on, buddy.<eos> What do you have against the flag, anyway?<eos> Because to most of the world, that flag has come to stand for war and conquest.<eos> Like that time when Neil Armstrong planted that flag right after slaughtering all those moon people.<eos> Mike, if the flag stood for anything else, you'd fly it every day, and not just those days that salute our military and its leaders.
Oh, she's really into this military stuff.<eos> It's raining.<eos> I gotta take the flag down.<eos> You know, when I was in 'Nam, I couldn't imagine fighting alongside a lady.<eos> I mean, you win wars with boots on the ground, Mike.<eos> Boots, not high heels.<eos> (Door closes) Hey, what are you doing home?<eos> I came home because it was raining.<eos> I was supposed to take the flag down, but it's not there.<eos> Somebody steal it?

He's crossed socioeconomic, race, and gender lines.<eos> One white males in his 40s, a wealthy hedge fund manager.<eos> And an African American female, just started college at San Francisco State, worked several jobs just to get by.<eos> Yeah, but why drain the blood?<eos> Is he doing it to torture the victims?<eos> Or is it about the blood?<eos> Might be a form of psychological torture.<eos> While not necessarily painful, exsanguination does take time.<eos> It could be a fetish for the blood and the bloodletting.<eos> What about... drinking it?
Are y... you the one that saved my life?<eos> Oh, there were a lot of people in on that.<eos> Well, they told us it was the pretty brunette.<eos> This is my husband, George married 22 years tomorrow.<eos> We were on our way to the wine country when he rolled the car over.<eos> We don't know how to thank you.<eos> For a while, you both had us a little scared.<eos> I heard that you couldn't find the cartilage or bone or something because my neck was too fat.<eos> - Well, I'm taking it like an omen to lose weight.<eos> So you not only saved my life, you maybe extended it.
Can't you see my daughter-in-law is sick?<eos> Leave our family in peace.<eos> Hello, Nolan. Where are you?<eos> Stahma, put Amanda on the line.<eos> Mayor Rosewater has taken ill.<eos> My husband is in charge now.<eos> What's the status, lawkeeper?<eos> Where is the medicine?<eos> In my possession.<eos> I will destroy it if my demands are not met.
How to spit in general.<eos> No-one's saying that your life is over.<eos> But it is going to change. Drastically.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> When my daughter was born I had to put everything on hold.<eos> My friends and school and my career and nobody told me that.<eos> Nobody told me how scary it was going to be either.<eos> When Maddie was two, she swallowed a nickel.<eos> I still haven't found it.
I think what your friend is trying to say... is that parenting is hard, honey.<eos> On the brighter side, I'm here.<eos> And I've been through it before.<eos> And... I'm gonna help you, honey.<eos> You're not alone. OK?<eos> Come here, honey bee.<eos> Oh, sweetie.<eos> It's gonna be OK.<eos> It's gonna be difficult at first but...<eos> Before you know it your life is going to be right back where you left it.
He's keeping it all inside.<eos> That's Michael.<eos> He's a little uptight.<eos> I'm just saying.<eos> You don't know him like I do.<eos> After Michael's family was killed, he buried his pain so deep, no one even knew it was there.<eos> When it finally came out...<eos> He almost killed himself.<eos> Your pizza is here.<eos> I'll have one of my men bring it in.
After Michael's family was killed, he buried his pain so deep, no one even knew it was there.<eos> When it finally came out...<eos> He almost killed himself.<eos> Your pizza is here.<eos> I'll have one of my men bring it in.<eos> No, no.<eos> He brings it in himself.<eos> No tricks.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> He brings it in himself or we start shooting.
We could really use those cameras right about now. Ah! Michael!<eos> Michael, he's going for the door.<eos> Lock it!<eos> Nikita-<eos> Do it!<eos> You really got a thing for Mexican standoffs, huh?<eos> I got it.<eos> Open the door.<eos> It's just a wood door.<eos> Why don't you kick it down?
I thought honored position all but mine.<eos> Now I fear he favors another.<eos> Then you stand as your mother, bound by blood and inconsiderate worth.<eos> It is a thing of rare beauty.<eos> Is it not?<eos> Yes, Dominus.<eos> You will carry it when you face Spartacus?<eos> I shall carry my father's sword.<eos> It is not as well bred or considered as this... yet it holds deeper meaning.<eos> Caesar will carry it then?
Present your fates.<eos> No, no, fuck!<eos> You cannot do that!<eos> Apologies there is so little.<eos> Food grows scarce.<eos> You risk life for us.<eos> There is no more we can ask of you.<eos> See heart lifted with welcomed news.<eos> Crassus and his legions are but a day's march from our city.<eos> He will retake it, and in the act end our suffering...
And do I mistake your eyes stealing glance as I pass?<eos> Or breath from lips catching when I draw near?<eos> I had feared night spent beneath open sky.<eos> Gratitude.<eos> A thing of little note.<eos> Little?<eos> It was but short time past you would have found joy in my suffering.<eos> Do not think me so far removed from thought.<eos> Then why offer hand?<eos> I offer it towards Spartacus.
I would see blade returned to you now.<eos> Naevia!<eos> Take pause.<eos> Crassus offers trade!<eos> His son's life for five hundred captured in battle with Crixus!<eos> Another Roman lie!<eos> I do not believe it so.<eos> Yet I lay choice with the one most wronged by the boy.<eos> I held your life in my hands.<eos> Live each moment knowing that one day soon I shall reclaim it.
-Do you know the judge?<eos> -No.<eos> She was forced to take the case. None of the judges wanted to take it.<eos> Hold this please.<eos> A bag, quickly.<eos> Next time tie its legs.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I took two semesters of veterinary medicine.<eos> Your Honor, we filed the lawsuit three weeks ago, but Mr. Novy still hasn't accepted it.
-You look tired. Problems?<eos> -Not really.<eos> -You are not a good liar.<eos> -Can I count on you?<eos> And now, the truth.<eos> How many witnesses like me do you have?<eos> I see.<eos> But I can't miss the chance to act as a witness for such a pretty lawyer.<eos> Ilonka made soup for you.<eos> I'll ask the nurse to warm it up.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's locked.<eos> Primitive but forceful as sporting portraits go.<eos> Mr. Reuben Hayes?<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> It's printed over the door.<eos> We were looking for some refreshment.<eos> Were ya?<eos> And would be obliged if you could furnish it.
Where's Daddy's gun?<eos> Jessie, they're gonna build an express way through here!<eos> We might have to move to Florida.<eos> - Where's Daddy's gun?<eos> - In the attic.<eos> - I looked in the attic.<eos> - Well, you didn't look good enough.<eos> In one of the shoeboxes, I think.<eos> Yes, there's an empty box from that pair he wore at the hospital.<eos> When he died, they said I could have it back.
- Why so many?<eos> You gobbled the porridge, you drink the water. Plus the contraption.<eos> Cross the contraption out, we're not taking the contraption.<eos> Put it down.<eos> Let's take it. At least we'll bring back some technology.<eos> Otherwise they won't believe us.<eos> Then give him the violin, if you want it so much.<eos> The violin is Italian. 18th century.<eos> It costs 1,000 rubles, if not more.<eos> How am I going to pay for it?
At least to visit us?<eos> Wild horses couldn't keep me away.<eos> How fortunate Philip stopped the combat when he did.<eos> - Fortunate for whom?<eos> - For you, of course.<eos> Another minute, and the war would've been over as far as you're concerned.<eos> Self-delusion is a very dangerous game, Lydia.<eos> If you'd been paying attention... you'd have realized that I'd just begun my attack.<eos> Of course.<eos> And like most of your attacks, you began it on your back, in the slime.
She introduced Christianity here.<eos> Have you seen the cross of vine, fastened with a woman's hair lock?<eos> And this is the light-faced Tamar.<eos> Dev locked her up in a dark dungeon, but the darkness lifted, the doors of the dungeon opened up, and the divine Tamar is shining again, as a morning star in the sky.<eos> And this is Parnavaz. He created our alphabet.<eos> The Holy Virgin, robed in Sun, had inspired him to perform this great act.<eos> There's a statue of Parnavaz on the lber Mountain in Mzkheta.<eos> And this is Amiran.<eos> The Greeks called him Prometheus.<eos> He had stolen fire from the gods and given it to mankind.
You come in.<eos> And you, who are you?<eos> I'm Toño and he's my friend Pablo.<eos> They're just scrubbing the path, Don Cristóbal.<eos> There's really nothing you can do to help kids like those, Francisco.<eos> No employee who works in my companies will be unionized.<eos> We have the right, Don Cristóbal, to improve our living conditions.<eos> What rights are you talking about?<eos> I pay them enough money.<eos> If then they decide to spend it in bars, that's their problem.
What's up with the furniture?<eos> What the Hell's going on?<eos> Don Rodolfo!<eos> Don Rodolfo was the one who took the furniture.<eos> He didn't want to wait for us to pay the back rent.<eos> So what do we do now?<eos> The old grunge!<eos> The furniture, buddy!<eos> The chair.<eos> Yeah, he took it.
You left that a bit late!<eos> Now listen to me! All of you.<eos> I hold in my hands the Great Crystal. The Great Crystal that was removed from its socket by my ancestor, when the Mara was banished to the dark places of the inside.<eos> Now, after 500 years, the Mara has returned.<eos> It's fitting that it should be I who restores the Great Crystal to its rightful owner.<eos> -(SNAKE HISSING)<eos> No, no!<eos> No, don't look!<eos> You must not look!<eos> The Mara is feeding on the fear and panic, it needs it!
When the bullets were flying on the yacht, I felt the kind of rush of blood pumping I've only had, well, when the cards are<eos> Are you still mad about your 10 percent of the $300,000?<eos> Where's the microfilm?<eos> On the boat.<eos> I hid it there when I realized Thompson suspected me.<eos> Are you satisfied?<eos> It's a chopper. I think it's the Coast Guard.<eos> I'll light the signal.<eos> No, t-they won't see it from that direction.<eos> The transmitter will bring it in.
- You didn't answer my question, gray meat.<eos> You on a toll road, man.<eos> Breaker, breaker, gray meat.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You didn't think about this, did you?<eos> What you gonna do now, huh, son?<eos> - What I got is this gun!<eos> - Cool, man.<eos> Detective Henry Goldblume, Hill Street Station.<eos> And if you're looking for trouble, son... congratulations, you just found it.
Oh, do hurry up.<eos> - Oh, yes, sir.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I'd like to explain everything.<eos> We didn't mean to steal the map.<eos> We didn't mean to run away--<eos> What do you mean, you didn't mean to steal the map ?<eos> - It, it just sort of--<eos> - Of course you didn't mean to steal it.<eos> I gave it to you.
Take me, for example...<eos> They wanted to know some names, so I told them... otherwise they wouldn't get off my back.<eos> That's terrible!<eos> Just invent some names or they'll get heavy.<eos> You've got some good names.<eos> Bráulio, Otávio...<eos> Fuck you! Wait! Life isn't always like you want it to be.<eos> You have to get what you can out of the situation.<eos> Whenever you get a chance.<eos> You get an office, secretary, nobody asks how you got it.
All right, we'll put some mustard on this pig.<eos> But, what will you take it with?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - It's bad to eat mustard so late.<eos> - Will answer it?<eos> - No, it's probably for you.<eos> Hallo?<eos> Hi, Loredana.<eos> Yes.<eos> This cheese is good, Where did you buy it?
All you gotta do is breathe on the suckers, and they give up.<eos> You can't get your man with six bullets, you might as well go in with a tank.<eos> Anybody know those two guys?<eos> Loomis was in the car with us, wasn't he?<eos> Just out of the academy.<eos> The other one too.<eos> He was a rookie too?<eos> What was his name?<eos> What difference does it make?<eos> They still had their coffee in their hands when they got it.
I just cannot take it!<eos> Do you think I'm made of steel, Miss Lu-Lu?<eos> He's here, Francine.<eos> At first I thought he was walking a dog.<eos> Then I realized it was his date.<eos> I'll be right there!<eos> God, Francine, hasn't he ever heard of the Hilton?<eos> Wait till I get my hands on him.<eos> They went down that way, but I don't know which room. I picked up her scent already.<eos> Cheap Midnight in Paris perfume. I can smell it anywhere!
They paid his ransom. Giovanni is here and alive.<eos> Whom did they pay it to?<eos> Let's go home.<eos> No. let me be with people.<eos> I was shut up so long.<eos> I'll go get the champagne.<eos> We've got to celebrate.<eos> Make him dance. Have some fun.<eos> Don't ask. All that matters is that he's alive and well.<eos> And solving the enigma of a son who dies and is reborn I'll leave it to you.
We came forth like water, and are gone like the wind."<eos> In a space of twenty years, you can really live in only a small number of homes.<eos> These of mine have all been poor, but they have always been well situated.<eos> Those were admitted who deserved to be;<eos> the rest were turned away at the door.<eos> Freedom then had few other such havens.<eos> "Where are those merry companions of times gone by?"<eos> These are dead;<eos> another lived even more quickly, until the iron gates of insanity snapped shut.<eos> The sensation of the passing of time has always been vivid for me, and I have been attracted by it, just as others are allured by dizzying heights or by water.
- I know it by heart.<eos> - I did the best I could.<eos> I even yelled.<eos> - Go yell some more.<eos> - Right.<eos> What are we gonna do, Colonel?<eos> Well, we'll stretch out the pentothal as best we can.<eos> When that's gone, we'll just have to use ether and nitrous oxide.<eos> I presume we have those, Sergeant Huckster.<eos> We're lousy with it. You can't give that stuff away.
I'll tell your husband!<eos> This is a bit younger, still dances...<eos> Thank you, thank you, gentlemen, thank you, thank you, kind gentlemen, thank you, kindest ladies,<eos> a coin of happiness removes the sadness.<eos> Thanks Grandpa, thank you, good luck, good luck to all and good night, thank you and good night.<eos> The social order, unfortunately, is always lagging behind the new demands of life.<eos> Only when become of common possession the achievements of knowledge and of progress, then we can finally talk about new achievements of civilization.<eos> When a better justice and respect for every right of the citizen become daily norm, institution, rule of life accepted and practiced by all, when no one will be able to enjoy privileges that are denied to others,<eos> then only we can say that we have built a democratic society.<eos> Unfortunately, social progress walks slowly, hampered by those who fear it, but also, above all, not supported with sufficient courage and sacrifice by those who call on it instead as a human right!
Frankly, Mrs. Otterbourne, I don't consider being likened to a nymphomaniacal baboon, ﬂattering. And I suggest we leave it to our lawyers to decide what is adequate compensation for being the butt of your vulgar drivel!<eos> - Good afternoon.<eos> - Philistine!<eos> I'll show you what reputation is about!<eos> - I'm sorry to intrude.<eos> - Uncle Andrew.<eos> But these are the papers, I told you, needed signing.<eos> The lease on the Chrysler Building... Ah, let's see, the silver mine concessions, Baku oil transfers and the Corn Crisp/Choo-chew merger.<eos> Just sign on the last page, right on the bottom, my dear.<eos> But, Uncle Andrew, I haven't even read it yet.
Ice.<eos> Manny, Manny listen.<eos> Next, how much do you want?<eos> Half a block?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Careful, it's heavy.<eos> Manny, see it's like this, I need a loan.<eos> How much? 50 bucks will do.<eos> - What for?<eos> I'll pay it back as soon as I can.
The fellow who helped to turn people into machines used to go berserk watching bricklayers work, or rather - not work.<eos> He was an american engineer, a guy called Frank Gilbreth, who studied expert oyster openers, swordsmen, typists, you name it, and got all fussed up about how disorganized ordinary peoples' work was.<eos> And he and his psychologist wife set about putting things right.<eos> They looked at the way people moved when they did a job, put lights in their hands, filmed in action, and then, used the films to make 3D models, of the movements, so they could redesign the moves,<eos> so as to make the jobs more efficient.<eos> They even put a grid everywhere to measure the movement, down to the inch.<eos> This was world champion typist, miss Hortense Stolinitz, showing just what she could do.<eos> And you know how the surgeon says, "forceps", and the nurse slaps it into his hand?<eos> That was one of the Gilbreth's ideas, too.<eos> Everywhere they went, they took a job to bits and put it together again, in a way that saved time.
I have come here to save you.<eos> If you follow my advise... nothing will happen to you, quite the contrary.<eos> - If you gave up love...<eos> - To Griselda...<eos> If you gave up love... seven carts of gold and precious stones... every seven days will be at your door for you.<eos> And you'll be seventy times seven powerful and rich.<eos> Wo are you...?<eos> And so that you trust me, I bring you this advance.<eos> All this is yours, Nazareno.<eos> You can take it.
Well, that's not the only question, sir.<eos> There's something else that I've been wondering about.<eos> Perhaps we'd better speak in my office, Lieutenant.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You were saying, Lieutenant?<eos> I was about to mention the $10,000.<eos> What of it?<eos> Well, I have to verify, sir, whether this money actually came from the safe in the Legation.<eos> I see.<eos> I see. You think perhaps Rahman saved it up on a code clerk's salary?
- Till 6:00 a.m. Thursday.<eos> - Listen to this. "No voyager on the Hindenburg need fear fire from within the ship."<eos> Et cetera, et cetera.<eos> That's the same magazine that predicted Landon would beat Roosevelt in 32 states.<eos> That's why I read Ballyhoo exclusively, sir.<eos> Every time she puts in here it's like walking on a crate of eggs.<eos> A booby-trapped crate of eggs.<eos> Remember what happened the last time we took the Los Angeles up?<eos> Yes, sir. If we hadn't had helium, we wouldn't be here.<eos> Have you found it, Colonel?
Honest?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Please check if it's all right.<eos> - Nice and warm.<eos> - But it's boiling.<eos> It's fine for me.<eos> - You want to wash your hair?<eos> - Is it expensive?<eos> 25 cents with herbs.<eos> And 25 cents for me to wash it.
All right, Lieutenant.<eos> I never was a very good liar.<eos> You might just want to know the truth.<eos> Eddie Kane mailed me this outline last year.<eos> And the moment I read it, I realized it had the makings of a very commercial book.<eos> But I also realized that Eddie Kane was not the guy to write it.<eos> I mean, he simply wasn't a writer.<eos> Fortunately, Allen was looking around for a new idea.<eos> When I showed him this, he jumped at it.<eos> Lieutenant, I was not trying to steal it. Quite the contrary. I offered Eddie Kane $5,000 for it.
Rotten to the core.<eos> I'd never let him do that to me without laughing gas.<eos> Why, he's the same doctor that took out my appendix with only a quart and a half of tequila.<eos> What do you think, boys?<eos> Solid gold.<eos> Now, the side door is about 35 feet from the front door.<eos> Les, you'll come in this way.<eos> Me and Will will go in through the front.<eos> Now, once inside, the teller stands here, and generally, the guard over here.<eos> They've got gold brick, but it's too heavy for the horses, so we'll leave it.
Thousands of our citizens are dying and require our help.<eos> The League of Nations has refused assistance to the starving Russia...<eos> Food will only be delivered against payment in gold.<eos> I therefore direct that all confiscated gold and valuables be sent immediately to Moscow.<eos> Dzerzhinsky, Chairman of the Cheka.<eos> What can you expect?<eos> The League of Nations...<eos> - How much did we confiscate?<eos> - In gold, 526 thousand.<eos> We have to ship it to Moscow, but how?
So if you place any value on your life you better take your Indian friend and get out of here fast.<eos> You come on over to my office, and I'll see that the old chief gets a drink of water.<eos> -Darn!<eos> -You are a couple of morons.<eos> -You better get it all up.<eos> -Hey, you wanna have some fun?<eos> Hey, old buddy, let me see these glasses.<eos> I didn't know they made glasses for Indians.<eos> There's a powerful lot of hate in this town.<eos> I hope your Indian friend can survive it.
A peculiar moment during a lunch party.<eos> And in Switzerland, checks are not accepted.<eos> You pay cash on the table.<eos> - That's Switzerland.<eos> You are Swiss. - [ Laughing ]<eos> And you know it.<eos> [ Edith] If you did those paintings, my compliments.<eos> And I only think it's a pity that there are not more people like you.<eos> And we only pray that he doesn't exist again!<eos> [ Man On TV] Mrs. Irving now claims Mr. Hughes himself asked Mrs. Irving... to deposit the money in a Swiss bank and then draw it out.
He must've had his fingers crossed...<eos> 'Cause we're crossing the hunting ground for the O-sage and the Cherokee and the Pawnee and the Arapaho.<eos> You're just joshing, ain't you, Loney?<eos> I wish you wouldn't. They hate to catch white men on their hunting ground.<eos> You know the Arapaho?<eos> They're the nicest bunch.<eos> - You know what they do?<eos> - No.<eos> First, they cut your pecker off.<eos> - Then they feed it to you.
Get on that wagon, boy.<eos> Quit wasting' time.<eos> These people, they need some kind of help.<eos> You can't help 'em.<eos> Some things are more important to a man than cattle, Mr. Culpepper.<eos> Not to me.<eos> Roll 'em.<eos> - Move 'em out!<eos> Give me your rifle and some ammunition.<eos> I said, give it to me!
Your daughter has another father. Wiser, richer, more loving and powerful.<eos> Trust in God and do not despair.<eos> If God is fair, He will not forgive my sins.<eos> We must not doubt nor hope.<eos> No one will escape the rope!<eos> I sentence the accused...<eos> Joaquim José da Silva Xavier... also called Tiradentes,<eos> to be taken through the streets to a place of execution, there to die a natural and eternal death.<eos> After death, his head will be cut off and exposed in a public place, impaled on the highest post.<eos> His body will be quartered... and exposed on the road to Minas, until time shall consume it.
Angela DeMarco and Debby McGee.<eos> We tried, Billie.<eos> Those Sunray people, they wouldn't go for it.<eos> They just wouldn't buy it.<eos> I suppose we could've told you upfront... but we were just hoping they'd get some sense in their heads and change their...<eos> Mr. Marshall, the network scout, he was on the phone all during the show... arguing with them, Billie.<eos> Look, you fellows don't have to explain it.<eos> I understand.<eos> They're trying to sell soap, right?<eos> Everybody knows we don't use it.
- What do you want now?<eos> - We're going for a ride.<eos> You know this?<eos> You will be able to report the robbery to the police.<eos> And the van?<eos> The police will find it today or tomorrow.<eos> You know this.<eos> - We are going to return.it<eos> - Yes, I know already<eos> A walk and soon I report it to the the police.
Wait for me, Nicolás!<eos> Come on, keep telling me about this.<eos> Hey!<eos> Look how stupid you are!<eos> Tonight we have to take him to the cemetery.<eos> To bury it?<eos> A cat isn't a Christian.<eos> At the last bell of midnight,... the wind will come up and reveal to us three demons.<eos> That many?<eos> When you see them, grab the cat by the legs and fling it at them... while you tell them --- pay attention! --- :...
I think they got mixed up, I asked for a doll but they brought two.<eos> How strange!<eos> What bad luck!<eos> That's the first time they've failed that I know of.<eos> Don't be sad, Pedro, you'll see, we'll get your suit some other way.<eos> Where?<eos> My dad can't afford it.<eos> The Kings failed, Don Victorino doesn't want to stake me a loan.<eos> We'll keep thinking.<eos> Hey, and what if Don Victorino gave it to me, without him knowing?
Where, when, how?<eos> When you were giving us the oil.<eos> When I was giving you the oil?<eos> Is this possible?<eos> Look, boy, what you're saying is very serious.<eos> Yes, Don Victorino, it's just that I asked the Three Kings for the suit but they blew me off.<eos> They blew you off...do you want to know something?<eos> When your father finds all this out the Vietnam war will seem like a few firecrackers compare to what'll happen to you. We understand each other?<eos> But I already brought it back, Don Victorino!<eos> You gave it back... Go away, go away before I break that pumpkin you carry on your shoulders!
Lieutenant Amberjack, that's good enough.<eos> Private Benjamin, put your book away.<eos> Don't fire on the first rush. Wait till they hit the wire.<eos> -I'm gonna have a look.<eos> -Check the duke.<eos> -He's harmless.<eos> -No.<eos> He's not gonna let this happen.<eos> The duke will have the Germans build a wooden horse.<eos> We'll be so curious we'll bring it in the castle.
But we're going to take you back there.<eos> Go on, Mr. Adams.<eos> Tell us.<eos> It was the Meхican that took us there.<eos> The one that was brought up by the Apaches.<eos> He didn't want no gold for himself.<eos> He was afraid.<eos> Kept talking about the old Apache spirits.<eos> All he wanted was a string of horses.<eos> So we gave it to him.
- The girl got herself wet falling in, Bob.<eos> - I did not fall in.<eos> - They was scaring me.<eos> - That's all it was, just a little scared.<eos> You have a dress there to pay for.<eos> Sure.<eos> Sure thing, Bob.<eos> Pretty dress for a pretty girl ain't never a waste of money, honey.<eos> - I ain't never had no $5 before.<eos> - Got it now, honey.
- How nice!<eos> So let's see if I can help you make things clear once and for all<eos> You always say you're cold, but then you don't put enough clothes on<eos> You're such a darling<eos> How can this be possible?<eos> A woman like you - intelligent, independent with great clearness of mind doesn't know what she wants when it comes to feelings<eos> I don't know. Do you?<eos> At least I don't annoy you all the time with my problems<eos> Are you really annoyed that I keep asking you for advice?<eos> No, but at least I'd like you to put it into practice
Boss Gonzo, have some to mark our acquaintance.<eos> This sake is a bit salty.<eos> What is your business?<eos> I'd like you to give me something.<eos> Give you what?<eos> The 420 ryo you collected from the seven merchants.<eos> I'd like you to return that money to me.<eos> What?<eos> I'm sure you have -<eos> You won't give it to me?
This is the pilot concerned - Leutnant Bruno Stachel.<eos> This way.<eos> The new monoplane.<eos> - Is it as fast as we've heard? - Faster.<eos> What about its manoeuvrability?<eos> Only one wing - will it take the stress?<eos> It will outturn any Allied plane at present in the air.<eos> It could even turn the tide of the air war.<eos> Then we must have it.<eos> What if I told you that these gentlemen believe that there will be risks for you pilots if we hurry it into production now?
My father?<eos> I haven't seen him for 10 years.<eos> Well, say good-bye to your friends, you have a family matter to settle.<eos> The family lawyer's expecting us.<eos> So come quick if you don't want me to make you happy here.<eos> All right, I'm coming.<eos> We need the young man here too. Come on!<eos> You've got to come too.<eos> - Another car is tailing them?<eos> - No, the old one would see it at once.
-Do you want a drink?<eos> -No, thank you, sir.<eos> Privilege of command.<eos> Now, Captain Cash, I have over here a rather large problem.<eos> -Yes, sir.<eos> Now, there sits the little Sicilian village of Valerno.<eos> We just learned that it's being held by an Italian force, company strength.<eos> I don't have to tell you that everything we've got is in the field.<eos> My only available unit is Company C.<eos> Now, the question is, do we bypass Valerno or do we knock it out?
17 and 18 in row F. That'll be £2, 10 shillings, please.<eos> 17 and 18, oh, yes, that's fine.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Do you have two gangway stalls for tomorrow's matinee, please?<eos> Yes, we have F-12 and 13.<eos> - Did you see the envelope?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Could you read it?<eos> - Short of indecently assaulting her, no.<eos> But as she posted it in the "London and Abroad" box, and as the theatre tickets were booked for tomorrow's matinee, I assumed she wasn't mailing it abroad.
I would need few days break.<eos> You are a funk anyhow.<eos> What a fireworks!<eos> But they drop it far away. Don't you need the fires, damned?<eos> - Where are they dropping it?<eos> - Somewhere in the fields.<eos> Far away from the factory.<eos> Bullshit, the visibility was quite good.<eos> I know what the real bombing looks like and you too, anyhow.<eos> We saw it together in France.
Well, it's okay, isn't it?<eos> There's nothing left of it.<eos> Guffy, come on.<eos> When are they gonna let us fight?<eos> Let's go.<eos> It's here, sir, the information you requested from headquarters.<eos> That's it.<eos> They're running out of gas.<eos> Where's the spearhead of the German advance right now?<eos> We place it four miles past Ambleve, moving west.
You mean a torpedo out of a balloon.<eos> I take it. Then. That you still don't think Peenemunde should be bombed.<eos> Certainly not.<eos> Air marshal. What have you got to say?<eos> Well. To attack Peenemunde would mean diverting the RAF from their main task... - ...which is to destroy German industry.<eos> - Quite.<eos> And apart from that. To reach Peenemunde... we'd have to fly through their air-defense system.<eos> No ﬁghter cover. I suppose?<eos> I'm afraid not at that distance.<eos> And once we've attacked it. The whole place will bristle with guns.
Would you look just a little harder, please, Chief, sir?<eos> A little black bank book in there.<eos> Read what that says.<eos> - This one?<eos> - That's it.<eos> Fifty-four hundred dollars.<eos> Where'd you get it?<eos> It's in the bank right here, deposited this very day.<eos> You saw that, didn't you?<eos> I asked you where you got it, boy.
- Good.<eos> - And I owe it all to you.<eos> Miss Timberlake, I'm glad I almost ran you down today.<eos> I am too.<eos> Let's go and toast that puddle that brought us together.<eos> - Do you care for Italian food?<eos> - Oh, I love it.<eos> Good, I know a little place, if you like fettucine?<eos> - Er, yes.<eos> - This is the only place to have it.
I'll do it again.<eos> Just watch me.<eos> You're fired! You see?<eos> Why don't you give me a chance to explain what happened?<eos> I don't want any explana...<eos> I want the money. $700. What for?<eos> To cover for the damages your son caused.<eos> What a mess it was.<eos> I haven't got $700.<eos> You haven't got... Then your father will have to pay it!
The poor girl threw herself in the river, and not in august, but in february.<eos> And from that day, every night at 8 o'clock,<eos> Dona Flora goes to the Cestio bridge... and throws herself into the river.<eos> Inteligencia is important.<eos> So, let's go to the river and wait on bridge Cestio until she throws herself and then we save the ancestor of don Aníbal.<eos> You think you're making a fool of me, but you are the fools.. you who don't believe that ghosts exist.<eos> Sometimes even I don't believe it.<eos> When I eat peppers at night, I have some kind of flutter...<eos> It happens a lot with peppers.<eos> I hardly digest it, but I like it.
Paradine, the order's out.<eos> You're to take yourself to bed.<eos> You're to sleep the night. Make your report to me in the morning.<eos> This is my report, lieutenant.<eos> Where's mallory's troop?<eos> They went up the north ridge late this morning.<eos> Yeah, there's a group of yankees camped up there, wasn't there?<eos> Company strength at least, wasn't there?<eos> That's what we figured? But what's that got to do with all this?<eos> Who goes there? I conjured up a spell, and i... and i turned it in the direction of that ridge.
Take them.<eos> 500 ryo...<eos> I can reassure you that Tamazuru will be yours.<eos> "The sale of this sword will pay for the child's education."<eos> Our subcontractors are panicking.<eos> The purchased thread is of bad quality.<eos> I can't really believe it.<eos> If they say it, it means it is true.<eos> In bad times, bad luck makes bad luck.<eos> Tell them that we'll buy their thread and that we'll compensate for it.
Now you've got money?<eos> Yes, I've got money!<eos> I didn't have it yesterday 'coz you don't need 400 grand to jump in the river.<eos> But it's mine, that money.<eos> You listening?<eos> 400,000!<eos> No matter how hard they try, they won't.<eos> Even though they walk past it every day.<eos> Whadda you telling me?<eos> I've stashed it in a writing desk.
Sandy, where did you get this suit?<eos> Rooming house over on Kingsbridge, why?<eos> I'd like to meet the fella.<eos> He don't have to wait for any cigarette change.<eos> His money just breaks in pieces.<eos> The pants presser notified the New York Field Office of the bureau.<eos> Agents were sent out.<eos> Then the man didn't give you the suit?<eos> No, the landlady.<eos> This fella piles it outside his door before he goes to work.
I never know what to wear to a picnic.<eos> If you got the style, it don't matter.<eos> You elected me president.<eos> You gotta have confidence in me.<eos> - AII I says is that we were wasting-<eos> - No time to talk ultimatums and strikes.<eos> - But that 7 and a half cents.<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> No question we're gonna get that 7-and-a-half-cent raise.<eos> Other companies are paying it and we're entitled.
Don't whistle.<eos> Not now.<eos> - Why?<eos> - You have no feelings.<eos> What will you do with the money?<eos> Return it to Maria.<eos> So nobody knows anything.<eos> What will you tell her?<eos> I will tell her...<eos> I will say... Pierrot no longer needed it.
I did not bring those women and children here!<eos> They were taken, up!<eos> I've said several times, that it was not them, but Harper!<eos> He brought them and he stopped here!<eos> Sit down and not listen, think only I know how You're going, to kill them or play them!<eos> And you want me to guess?<eos> Is it different, than it was before?<eos> People come and start plowing my ranch.<eos> First is an acre, then ten, Then it is the half of the valley.<eos> Well, Harper brought it here.
Ever fleeting, ever shifting<eos> Yet we could keep it from drifting<eos> If we'd only dare<eos> Grasp that world<eos> You've been to<eos> Carry it right into<eos> Bright blue day<eos> Feel it<eos> Seal it<eos> Don't let anybody steal it

Listen...<eos> I want to give you one last chance.<eos> I'll talk to the Mayor and try to persuade him.<eos> I'll also try to get you your bonus.<eos> You don't deserve it, but I'm feeling generous.<eos> How much is the bonus?<eos> Ten thousand, but don't say a word.<eos> - May I ask you something?<eos> - Go on. - When?<eos> - At the end of the year. You can have it now, if you need it.
We need a wire service.<eos> I was over at Associated Press... You know what they want for their service, for a week?<eos> $300! Well, the AP's worth it.<eos> Sure..sure...<eos> I was just thinking...<eos> If I had $300 what would I do with it?<eos> I'd get myself a lot of good newsprint... the finest paper money could buy. And I'd come out with a REAL headline...<eos> Big...bold...120point<eos> Where would you get such big type, Mitch? I'd make it...<eos> Cut it out of wood myself.
I'll be at corrals when he names his price.<eos> When you have the receipt, I'll arrest him.<eos> If he has a ledger, that'll be so much the better.<eos> Take him to Washington, confront the staff with the proof that the only way to fight espionage is with counterespionage.<eos> I'll bring some horses with Elm, and you can arrest him with Hudson.<eos> Right.<eos> Before I left Washington, Halleck gave me high-command opinion on organizing a group like ours.<eos> They laughed at the general.<eos> Said since counterespionage wasn't in the dictionary it seemed ridiculous to try to create something that couldn't be defined.<eos> Well, we're defining it for him.
Well, them, that's blasting gelatin, miss.<eos> Is it dangerous?<eos> Bless you, no, miss.<eos> That's safety stuff, that is.<eos> You can get it wet and it don't do it any harm.<eos> You set fire to it, and it just burns.<eos> You can hit it with a hammer and it won't go off.<eos> At least, I don't think it will.<eos> Takes a detonator to set it off.<eos> I'll put it over the side, though, if it worries you.
But why? Why go out and just pick a guy out of thin air?<eos> What's the point?<eos> The point is I'll forget it... if I get the right price.<eos> The right price is $25,000.<eos> What is this Goddard?<eos> A shakedown?<eos> It's my welfare work.<eos> I wouldn't want to see you go to prison.<eos> Look Goddard, you don't just... order up $25,000 like you would have a ham sandwich.<eos> Where would I get it?
Not like today's young people, dedicated to soccer bets. Right?<eos> Ines, put the flowers in a vase.<eos> Whatever!<eos> You're driving me bonkers!<eos> - You were a big hit.<eos> I've explained it to you 20 times, moron!<eos> Don't you understand that you have to play the butler?<eos> You know what a butler is?<eos> This one's worse than the parrot.<eos> Give me the name of the guests, I need to teach it to him.
We're gonna have our baby in style.<eos> I got a new job, a steady one, upstate in Schenectady.<eos> Remember my telling you about my staff sergeant, Ben?<eos> Well, I ran into him today.<eos> He's been doing swell the last couple of years in Schenectady.<eos> And he gave me a job.<eos> It looks like a good one too.<eos> - Well, that's wonderful, dear, but 200...<eos> - Well, he made me take it.<eos> He said he'd take it out of my pay a few dollars at a time.
Sure.<eos> I've got to.<eos> Why?<eos> Why, I'm not allowed to take money. Internes can't do that while they're serving time at a hospital.<eos> Hey, those weenies smell like they're done.<eos> You know, I was just thinking, say, when I get practicing, how many years do you suppose it'll be before someone hands me a $1,000 fee?<eos> 2 bucks a visit is the best dollar rate.<eos> I think you're a fool to give it back.<eos> And you don't think I like to.<eos> But you earned it.

But if I'd been all that I thought I was, things would be different now. You don't sow wheat and reap ashes, Pa.<eos> Oh, come on. Let's get out of here.<eos> Excuse me a minute, Ma. I want to get something. I'll be right out.<eos> Come on, Pa.<eos> - Fine time to tell us.<eos> You know, I always wanted to buy you a nice car, but it seems we always had to use the money for something else.<eos> - Do you see the old couple out there?<eos> - Uh-huh. It's always those kind that have a million bucks salted away.<eos> Well, I'm going out and pry them loose from some of it.<eos> If he's got a million bucks salted away, I'll bet he's forgotten where he put it.
I am Gaston Monescu.<eos> The police will be delighted to verify my identity.<eos> Gaston, did you take the money?<eos> Yes.<eos> You wanted a hundred thousand francs... and I thought you wanted me.<eos> I came here to rob you, but unfortunately I fell in love with you,<eos> Mariette.<eos> Why did you take the money?<eos> Madame, the only thing that seems to stand between you and romance... is a hundred thousand francs.<eos> Well, he didn't take it.
- Ruth.<eos> That's a swell name!<eos> Well, what's holding us up?<eos> Please get this straight...<eos> I need the money.<eos> I need it badly.<eos> - I wouldn't go with you, if I wasn't...<eos> - Oh, sure... I know!<eos> You don't have to explain, Honey, I've been around.<eos> I've got to have 64 dollars and 50 cents And I've got to have it now, tonight.

I know!<eos> You don't have to explain, Honey, I've been around.<eos> I've got to have 64 dollars and 50 cents And I've got to have it now, tonight.<eos> What's the 50 cents for... War Tax?<eos> - If I don't get it, I don't know what...
You are the gay heroes who will repulse the enemy... when you are called upon to do so.<eos> It is not for me to suggest that any of you... should stand up and offer to defend his country. But I wonder if such a thing is going through your heads.<eos> I know that in one of the schools, the boys have risen up in the classroom... and enlisted in a mass.<eos> But, of course, if such a thing should happen here, you would not blame me for a feeling of pride.<eos> Perhaps some will say... that you should not be allowed to go yet, that you are too young, that you have homes, mothers, fathers, that you should not be torn away.<eos> Are your fathers so forgetful of their fatherland... that they would let it perish rather than you?<eos> Are your mothers so weak that they cannot send a son... to defend the land which gave them birth?<eos> And after all, is a little experience... such a bad thing for a boy?<eos> Is the honor of wearing a uniform... something from which we should run?<eos> And if our young ladies glory in those who wear it, is that anything to be ashamed of?
This man is crazy.<eos> He killed a goat on October 14 Before any of us knew what happened and he was locked up in jail where he should have stayed.<eos> But then all y'all decided that Jerry must have saved us, that Jerry knew something.<eos> He sacrificed something to protect us.<eos> So now he's a holy man and he gets to walk around here Killing goats whenever he feels like it just in case?<eos> Babe, can you calm down, please?<eos> No, you let him do it, too.<eos> If there aren't any miracles in Miracle, then why does he get a pass?<eos> Cecilia, you were trying on your wedding dress when it happened, huh?<eos> So now you put it on every day and you take pictures with the tourists, huh?
I was gonna leave John.<eos> You're surprised because we seem so happy.<eos> My Grandmother was born here.<eos> She lived here all her life.<eos> She used to tell us kids this place is chosen.<eos> The Good Lord pointed His finger down on the final day of creation<eos> "You.<eos> The Jarden of Eden."<eos> We didn't believe her, but she said there was a way to prove it, a way to make your wishes come true.<eos> You take a bird, you put it in a box and you bury it.

Just shut up!<eos> What do you want?<eos> Sorry?<eos> Why do you keep following me?<eos> If you want me to do something, just fucking say it.<eos> I'm glad you finally asked, Kevin.<eos> There is something you need to do.<eos> In Cairo, Egypt, there is an ancient artifact.<eos> It's in a museum now.<eos> They found it in the tomb of Amenhotep.
Historic site number seven.<eos> Some say the earthquakes that occur in Jarden are a result of man-made fracking and wastewater disposal in nearby towns.<eos> But this crack in the street wasn't caused by a quake.<eos> It was the result of a gas explosion in the sewage system on October the 14 that sent manhole covers flying a few blocks over.<eos> Instead of repairing the damage, the town has left it as a reminder.<eos> _<eos> Historic site number 13.<eos> This is Cecilia's place.<eos> It turns out that the gown she tried on that afternoon wasn't even her cup of tea.<eos> Then when she heard what happened around the world on October the 14, she bought it immediately.
Protected by the dark arts.<eos> You shoot him, he doesn't die.<eos> You cut him, he doesn't bleed.<eos> He walks through fire, doesn't burn.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think that if he finds out that I helped Agent Fernandez or you, he'll kill my family.<eos> Do I fear Diablo? I do.<eos> And so should you.<eos> You did the right thing with the ledger.<eos> How'd you get it?

I do.<eos> And so should you.<eos> You did the right thing with the ledger.<eos> How'd you get it?<eos> Drug bust.<eos> A truck filled with contraband was leaving town.<eos> I stopped it.<eos> The man with the ledger was not your usual cartel thug.<eos> It was handwritten and looked important, so I took it.

Yeah, but...<eos> You're going to deliberately initiate a catastrophic failure of the V.P. residence systems?<eos> You got an alternative?<eos> We'll be blind minimum of 10 minutes before the system comes back up, if the system comes back up.<eos> I mean, that means no alarms, no lights.<eos> The President's a sitting duck.<eos> I'll take care of the President.<eos> Come on.<eos> Well, first, we'll flood the server with requests.<eos> That'll slow it down.
I'm in classified briefings on the Hill every day.<eos> How come I've never heard about this device?<eos> Okay, I get it.<eos> I'm the new kid on the Agent X block.<eos> Five days ago, I never knew this program existed.<eos> Now I'm running it.<eos> Dante has planted himself on a private island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.<eos> This weekend, he will hold his annual<eos> "Dante's Inferno" gala where he opens up the island to guests from all around the world.<eos> We need to get to the island and find and secure that device before Volker's agent gets to it.
- Are you sure about that?<eos> - You tell me.<eos> How's John?<eos> I don't know any John.<eos> But if I did, I'm sure he'd be doing everything he can to help.<eos> Who do I have to thank for this?<eos> Olga, and she took Dante's security bracelet.<eos> That means she can get anywhere on the island now.<eos> Did you bring your company plane?<eos> - Yes, do you need it?
I was trying to get it back.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> I thought you were on a date with an American.<eos> When you left me in that Chechen hellhole, you showed no mercy.<eos> And you better give me the device.<eos> Now.<eos> Not an option.<eos> Not an option?<eos> You know how many freelancers are out there looking for it?<eos> Look who's got it... me.
Hey, did Markayla take her good clothes with her?<eos> Yeah, and some of her mom's makeup, too.<eos> Meg took her favorite Jean jacket and boots.<eos> These girls were definitely planning on meeting boys, just maybe not the ones that they thought.<eos> What have you got?<eos> Uh, it's a ghost town.<eos> The hard drives are wiped clean.<eos> There's no instant messenger or Skype history.<eos> There's not even a user name.<eos> Dave, can you turn on Markayla's computer so Garcia can scan it.
Throw the bread in those.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't really see this as a bait-bucket kind of a place.<eos> No need to apologize.<eos> You'll catch on.<eos> I love these little hat napkins.<eos> Go with these. (Laughs) Hey, Mrs. Baxter.<eos> Hey, Cammy. - Hey. - Hey.<eos> Oh, there's my math book.<eos> I told you I left it here.
_<eos> _<eos> Yeah, that's it, that's it, that's it.<eos> Okay, you're looking for a small pouch with a red tag on it.<eos> _<eos> Okay, that's... that's it, yeah.<eos> That's it, that's it.<eos> Now you're looking for a brown container marked "fentanyl."<eos> F-e-n-t-a-n-y-l.<eos> - Do you see it?
I've got a source.<eos> Let me talk to him.<eos> Okay?<eos> Why are you so happy?<eos> What, did you crush a competitor at work or something?<eos> No, just made some progress on a deal.<eos> How was the debate?<eos> We kicked their asses.<eos> Topic was "Global fact or fiction."<eos> I rocked it with the extinction of the Monteverde toad.
I'm so sorry.<eos> Oh.<eos> Will you get her something to drink?<eos> - I'm... I'm fine.<eos> - You came at the perfect time.<eos> We were just going over the funeral details.<eos> Everything needs to be just right.<eos> Hey, it... it will be.<eos> I haven't even thought about the eulogy.<eos> Harrison, you... You'll write it.
- Please forgive me.<eos> - Of course.<eos> I can only say I was angry about something quite different.<eos> And I allowed it to cloud my judgement.<eos> Oh, we've all done that, m'lady.<eos> Finally, I'd like you to have this coat.<eos> I... I'm not sure it was a good idea.<eos> Please.<eos> Or I'll feel I've spoiled the day, which is the very last thing I'd want to do.<eos> - Furthermore, I want you to keep it.

Look, just because your son scored a bag of what appears to be Blue Dragon Ultimate Kush doesn't mean he's on a path to Satan.<eos> It's not just that.<eos> I came home and found him having relations with...<eos> A girl?<eos> A woman?<eos> Boy?<eos> Cantaloupe.<eos> Cantaloupe?<eos> I'm... I'm sorry, how does one...<eos> He said if you bore a hole in the fruit, and put it in the microwave, it provides a sensation of being with a woman.
This is my son-in-law Michael.<eos> Uh, he has something to say to you. You tell everyone you're a pastor?<eos> But I know what you really are.<eos> You're a psychic.<eos> I mean, how else could you know?<eos> - Know?<eos> - That Isabella and I were fighting over when to have a baby. That's what you meant by giving us that Bible passage, right?<eos> That the time is now?<eos> So you got that, huh?<eos> Ooh, I'll get it.
- Don't be.<eos> You listen to me closely and do exactly as I tell you.<eos> Remove the body.<eos> My engagement ring is gone!<eos> - Michaela...<eos> - How the hell do you have that?<eos> You were a disaster that night.<eos> I could tell you wanted to go to the police.<eos> - You recognize this ring?<eos> - I gave it to my husband on our wedding day.

In case whoever Rebecca texted tries to find me.<eos> Why would they want to find you?<eos> So they can find out what happened to Rebecca.<eos> What do you mean "what happened to Rebecca"?<eos> We... we taped her up and held her hostage.<eos> - What's going on, Frank?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Relax.<eos> I already got your number unlisted.<eos> You change it now, and the police ever learn Rebecca's M.I.A., it'll look suspicious you changed it the same time.
Then someone killed them, and now they're trying to blame us.<eos> - You think you were framed?<eos> - Don't you?<eos> What about your husband's murder trial?<eos> Won't you be too distracted to take on a big case like this?<eos> No, because I'm not on trial for his murder.<eos> - But you're a suspect.<eos> - Some people say that.<eos> But consider the facts...<eos> What if I did do it, killed my husband?
That all happened so quick. Before we knew what was going on, the mother and baby were whisked away by a van waiting outside.<eos> Oh my god.<eos> I can't believe how fast that all just happened.<eos> The baby... the woman...<eos> Sorry, I can't even talk.<eos> It turns out, it was like this the entire day.<eos> We just saw a baby being born 10 minutes ago and already, we're racing back upstairs to see the next baby being born.<eos> It's like this turnover is so quick here.<eos> A lot of chaos in there, but Dr. Patel, you can tell that she does this multiple times per day, 'cause she's got such ease about her.<eos> She takes the baby out, they cut the umbilical cord, pass it off to the washbasin.
I have no family and no priest.<eos> They gave up on me a long time ago.<eos> Listen.<eos> The warden can assign you a chaplain if you want one...<eos> I need nothing, thanks.<eos> I'm all I need.<eos> Look, Bones, this is, like, the fourth message that I've left you already, all right?<eos> So just do me a favor.<eos> I'm getting just a little worried right now, okay?<eos> So, you get this message, I want you to call me or text me, got it?
Or the party will hurt the governorship.<eos> We all benefit from a filibuster proof of majority.<eos> You know that, Eli.<eos> Hal, can you come in here, please?<eos> I have another meeting, so, Mrs. Florrick, I'm gonna have to ask you to stand and open your purse.<eos> - What?<eos> - Mrs. Florrick has a way of recording<eos> - her meetings.<eos> - Are you frisking us?<eos> We'll hold on to your cell phone and get it back to you in 12 hours.
Should Philippe lose his wife, then a power shift might emerge from her death.<eos> How could that be?<eos> Henriette's very existence strengthens your position.<eos> It keeps your brother's power in check and offers a direct connection to England.<eos> It unfortunately follows that her absence would weaken you in every possible way.<eos> My King!<eos> Madame de Clermont conspired against the king and she gave me the names of all those who shared her allegiance.<eos> I only knew her in passing.<eos> But you knew she had malevolent intent.<eos> It might have escaped your notice, but everyone in this building has malevolent intent, though only a few actually act on it.
We were taking the air with our governess, and we made a break for freedom.<eos> You went north, I went south and she went west, and by the time they'd righted themselves, we'd found our way down by the mill stream and then down by the promontory.<eos> God knows the wolves might've taken us, but what did we know?<eos> We were young, cats with nine lives.<eos> We found an old building, a sorry shack made out of stone and moss.<eos> You wanted to make it your castle, but I said, "Let's make it our fort", and for once in your life, you played along.<eos> We defended our position from the Spanish all morning and in honour of your distinguished service...<eos> She was the one that found it, actually:<eos> a yellow Spanish topaz buried in the mud.<eos> We awarded it to you for bravery in the days when it was only you who truly had my back, like only a brother can.
Your name wasn't Ruby Simms.<eos> My real name is Rikki Castillo.<eos> This is complicated.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> I was... I was abused when I was little.<eos> So, to get away from my parents, every summer I went to this sleep-away camp.<eos> It's, like, a camp for troubled kids, you know, juvenile delinquents.<eos> My best friend was a girl named Ruby Simms.<eos> I remember this field, and at the far end of it was this galaxy of fireflies swarming everywhere.<eos> She called it the edge of the world.
- Hello, Michael.<eos> - You missed your mark.<eos> Yeah, there was some confusion.<eos> I can still handle him.<eos> No, I put someone else on the Pakistani.<eos> What's the status of Harrison?<eos> You had an opportunity to complete that mission as well.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I have to find the right time.<eos> Let me find it for you.
You bring death, Odelle Ballard.<eos> You will suffer.<eos> Your turn.<eos> Who lives here?<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Who's that?<eos> What did you find out?<eos> The number was unlisted.<eos> I had to hack into a few cell phone company servers.<eos> - But I finally found it.
I knew killing that guy... it wasn't the answer.<eos> Her name is Juliana.<eos> Juliana Crain.<eos> She had a film.<eos> She thought the SD agent was her contact.<eos> He tried to kill her.<eos> She put up a fight. He went off the bridge.<eos> I helped get rid of the body to keep my cover intact, and that's it.<eos> That's all there is.<eos> Why did you keep it from me, Joe?
You have an antenna lead?<eos> Then let's find out.<eos> So, this woman, Val, is trying to link back into her network?<eos> As we speak.<eos> And you feel we can trust her?<eos> I think she's been won over.<eos> But we'll be observing everything she does.<eos> And we still have no sonar?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Our engineering team is trying to rig up a depth finder, but once we go hot with it, we'll be putting 10 times more current through it than it was designed for.
I'll let you put it on.<eos> Lieutenant.<eos> Lieutenant.<eos> You doing okay?<eos> Good as I can be.<eos> Stay safe out there, okay?<eos> You too.<eos> Kara.<eos> This sub... You've beaten them before.<eos> You'll sink it this time.
- No.<eos> But when she was talking about Lady Sybil, I had one of those moments where you look at your life and I realised how much better Sybil was than I am.<eos> - It was quite chastening.<eos> - You're hard on yourself, m'lady.<eos> Why did I have to be so pettish?<eos> She'd made something of her life, why shouldn't she?<eos> Now, don't panic. Are you in pain'?<eos> Oh, I was then.<eos> A sharp pain.<eos> I had it earlier.
You're back.<eos> You're in a hotel room in seattle.<eos> You're safe now.<eos> You're safe. Are you all right?<eos> Yep.<eos> Yeah, i'm good.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> I was...<eos> I was in my book.<eos> I was really there, just the way i wrote it.
Yeah, but you're not giving up.<eos> You know the trouble with just believing?<eos> It's too easy.<eos> Being skeptical without being closed-minded...<eos> That's the hard thing.<eos> So, no, I'm not giving up.<eos> I'm meeting with Jane's doctor.<eos> Gonna take a look at her hard drive.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> Still got it.
Is it in your DNA?<eos> Your passport?<eos> Or is it a process bonded to your cells?<eos> And if it is, if the soul exists as an energy, how can it be destroyed?<eos> You're talking about orchestrated objective reduction.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> It says that our souls exist, neurologically speaking.<eos> Fascinating.<eos> Our ghost was lynched.<eos> He was seeking sanctuary and denied it.
Donor is Adam Glenn.<eos> He was 34 years old.<eos> Suffered a major brain injury in a rock climbing accident.<eos> No cortical activity or brain stem function.<eos> Otherwise, perfect health.<eos> We have consent?<eos> He had a donor's card in his wallet.<eos> They've done an echo?<eos> His heart is in great shape.<eos> And my guy gets it, right?
I made a mistake.<eos> I have more good news for you.<eos> You work too hard, and you worry too much.<eos> That's good news?<eos> Neurologically, there's nothing wrong with you.<eos> My M.R.I. is clean? Mm. Well, you don't seem pleased.<eos> Well, it just doesn't explain what I experienced.<eos> Headaches and dizziness are often caused by exhaustion, anxiety...<eos> You think it's stress?<eos> Carolyn, you have had an extraordinarily difficult year, and you've handled it extremely well.
Come on.<eos> Open up.<eos> Open up.<eos> And we are still trying to find Kyle's cellphone.<eos> You know what, you obviously don't understand how hard this is for me, so... I... I think it's time for Peaches to come back.<eos> Of course, Mr. Mitchell.<eos> Don't worry about signing the consent form, after all.<eos> Since you've admitted to being at the crime scene, we'll just get a warrant.<eos> Buzz: Kyle had a burner phone.<eos> And we may never find it, but we do have his number because Grey's cell has lots of graphic texts back and forth with our victim.
♪ Happy birthday dear, Dad ♪<eos> ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪<eos> That was perfect.<eos> Just perfect, thank you guys.<eos> I love you, Daddy.<eos> We miss you.<eos> - I miss you too.<eos> - Did you get our present?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> That's why I'm wearing it.
What's going on?<eos> Pass me the keys.<eos> Hands on the wheel.<eos> I'm not gonna ask again.<eos> All right... Hey... Hey, man, what is this?<eos> Hold on!<eos> You can't do this!<eos> Wait!<eos> Do not open that trunk!<eos> Do not open it!
Sue: All you ever do is think of yourself! Axl:<eos> You already have like a gazillion pictures!<eos> Besides, high school doesn't even matter.<eos> Just wait till you get to college.<eos> That's what matters.<eos> You always say that!<eos> You said it when I was in elementary school, you're saying it when I'm in high school.<eos> Apparently, whatever stage of life I'm in is the one that doesn't really matter!<eos> Mom, Axl drove back to campus and didn't bring back the sombrero! What?<eos> Axl, why would you go all the way up there and not get it?
But tell me, how would that be funny?<eos> Sailorcow?<eos> Yeah, that makes sense.<eos> I told him I needed that sombrero, but he doesn't listen!<eos> Mom, you know that is true.<eos> He never listens to me!<eos> Okay, okay, okay!<eos> Axl, maybe you could go back up and get the hat.<eos> That would be a nice thing to do for your sister.<eos> I'm not even sure I have it anymore, you mental case.
I don't know!<eos> Look, we were celebrating cinco de February and it might have been used as a dip bowl.<eos> Oh, my god, mom, why is she being so nuts about this?<eos> You have to understand, Axl, this is Sue's senior year and it's really important to her.<eos> Maybe we could just find another sombrero.<eos> But that's the one that means something to me!<eos> I can't just sit on the cow in a random sombrero!<eos> Axl, think!<eos> Did hutch put it somewhere? !<eos> Did you put it somewhere?
11 miles on it.<eos> - Ma'am...<eos> - No, it's okay.<eos> Full house.<eos> Pair of sixes.<eos> I'm going dancing.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> So what color is my new ride, anyway?<eos> Maybe talk to him, convince him to give your car back.<eos> Or maybe I find the guy and I hold him at gunpoint... or bow-and-arrow point and I make him give it back.
But Dad's disappointed in me.<eos> So...<eos> Well, he's not the only one.<eos> I'll be going out tonight.<eos> Just my father and me.<eos> I need you to look the other way.<eos> It's important for me.<eos> - How'd it go with the paps?<eos> - You haven't seen?<eos> My phone was blowing up after Dad's speech, so I shut it off.
You have to talk to her.<eos> If you don't, she'll lash out and cause a scene.<eos> And when she does it reflects poorly on all of us.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> Len.<eos> Liam.<eos> She's just using you.<eos> Why don't you see that?<eos> All she cares about is her power.<eos> - Of course I see it.
I am gonna kick your ass!<eos> All the King's men...<eos> It's that half-breed blood in her.<eos> You're sitting on the throne.<eos> You got what you wanted.<eos> What does it matter to you if I am at my father's bedside?<eos> He's not your father.<eos> You must let it go.<eos> This is going to come back to you.<eos> When the King wakes up - and he will - your little reign of terror will be over, so you better enjoy it.
The last trace of George will be gone before the night is through.<eos> You will have your chance tonight to find out if the Countess is the same witch you fought all those years ago.<eos> When I see her, I will know if it really is her.<eos> You see, she bears my mark, just as I bear hers.<eos> More importantly, I will find where she keeps it.<eos> It?<eos> One unholy object allows her to maintain her obscenely long existence.<eos> Destroy it, you destroy her.<eos> But what exactly is this object?<eos> You will learn the price of that knowledge once I have located... it.
I can give you my list.<eos> They can all verify.<eos> My fans know I am not gonna stop digging until I find the killer.<eos> KC, the killer does not want you to keep digging.<eos> This isn't a game.<eos> This is real.<eos> Look what happened to Thomas.<eos> I've been researching this case for over a year.<eos> - I'm not just gonna let it all go to waste.<eos> - Well, then give it to me.
Okay.<eos> - Um, I'll get Laura, she'll fix it, right?<eos> - Right.<eos> I just called my husband to give him the good news.<eos> Oh, did you?<eos> What did he say?<eos> It went straight to voice-mail, I forgot his phone was off.<eos> - Bummer.<eos> - But I texted him a picture instead.<eos> As soon as he turns it on, he'll see me with the earrings.
Get it out.<eos> Get it out of me.<eos> Come here. Come here!<eos> You see what you make me do when you don't listen?<eos> That's a girl.<eos> That's a good girl.<eos> Is Potter alright?<eos> She is fine.<eos> Why the hell was her sack off.<eos> She went apeshit and tore it off.
Wow. Love is a battlefield.<eos> And I want to ride it This just puts everything in perspective.<eos> all night long.<eos> Oh, sweetheart.<eos> It's gonna be all right.<eos> No, it's not, I...<eos> I can't go through with the trade.<eos> What?<eos> I can't.<eos> Nothing inside me says to do it.
What are you doing?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I'm not trading with him.<eos> It's over.<eos> Love is, uh...<eos> Love has been rejected?<eos> Why would you reject love?<eos> ! Huh?<eos> !<eos> Everybody works so hard on getting love to happen, and then you reject it.
I wasn't even in the country, man.<eos> Weird.<eos> We don't have to cut her up into tiny pieces like we planned.<eos> Okay, good, but I have the saw.<eos> Awesome. I did not pay Robert Durst $90 for that go-bag... and not negotiate a saw.<eos> Okay, so what do we do?<eos> First things first, man, we need to get her body back to Chicago.<eos> And if we need to get her soul back from the netherworld, I know a really good necromancer.<eos> So this is the plan.<eos> Yeah. We're gonna go to Puerto Rico, we're gonna get her body, bring it back to Chicago, so she can be buried by the man she loves.
We can hide out in the jungle tonight.<eos> I'll scavenge up some second harvest.<eos> Are you a corn guy or a seeds guy?<eos> Corn.<eos> This is definitely the safest place to...<eos> I know, I feel totally safe here...<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Your dick broke my fall.<eos> All right, dude, tomorrow is a big day.<eos> We have to find my sister's body, before my dad buries it, or else we're gonna have to spend the entire day digging that grave up!
Oh, yeah, he lives off blood.<eos> Down, boy. Down.<eos> Oh, no, I've been training him.<eos> "Down, boy" means "Go for the dick."<eos> Oh, boy!<eos> Oh, he's really on there.<eos> You're right.<eos> Look at us, we fit in perfectly.<eos> No one suspects a thing.<eos> Now we just have to find the body before they light it on fire.
Yeah, I'm stuck.<eos> Well, we seem to be in a bit of a conundrum.<eos> How do I know this is your box?<eos> Do you have any identification, "Cece"?<eos> Cece's my ex-girlfriend;<eos> it's a box of her things.<eos> But I can tell you everything that's in there.<eos> There's some paintings, erotic writings, there's a brassiere.<eos> Why would you have her brassiere?<eos> Well, you know, she left it in my car, and I kept it.

"Finding inner strength in a time of crises."<eos> Cece, are you in crises?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Cece's fine.<eos> How are you?<eos> How's Fawn holding up?<eos> If you must know, my paramour Councilwoman Fawn Moscato has been so strong since the incident. You know, reporters are calling it Panty-Gate.<eos> There's pictures of her naked lady-bottom all over the Internet.<eos> Sid, put the phone away.<eos> You picked it up right when I said "naked lady-bottom."
You want someone taking that?<eos> I learned to code by copying other people's work, pulling it apart.<eos> So did you.<eos> Yeah, I've also had my work stolen.<eos> It's not pretty.<eos> We never would've met if you had copy protected "Parallax."<eos> Yeah, but we did meet.<eos> So, because we met, now I can copy protect our work without fear of us not meeting.<eos> Come on, we wrote this amazing game.<eos> I don't want anyone taking it from us.
Welcome back.<eos> - I wasn't about to miss this. - I know.<eos> Wanted to see what these freaks were like in person.<eos> It's really good to see you.<eos> Lev!<eos> You look so fragile. I want to hug you, but...<eos> Just be careful, Bodie.<eos> Heard the new game was pretty cool.<eos> Decided to check it out.<eos> Yeah, I think you'll dig it.
It could be universal.<eos> You could live your life there.<eos> It would change everything, I promise you.<eos> The world we live in now is going to look like the Stone Age.<eos> All these people with their things.<eos> The physical world is dead.<eos> A pathway is being built.<eos> A way out, into a world of pure information.<eos> A shared consciousness.<eos> The future is bearing down on us like a freight train and nobody sees it.
You know what makes me really mad?<eos> Racism?<eos> Classism?<eos> I don't know any more isms.<eos> I didn't get the promotion.<eos> They gave it to a guy, of course, who's been there half the time I have.
Oh, thank God you caught this, you're the man.<eos> No, I'm the man. I'm the man!<eos> You know what?<eos> If you didn't work for me, I'd hire you.<eos> Let's really stick to the process and avoid this...<eos> Great plan, Gabi.<eos> Now she's depressed-o.<eos> Elliot...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was up all night thinking about Alan's kugel and how I'm never gonna have it again.
No.<eos> No.<eos> You did all you could do.<eos> You played your part.<eos> Not well enough.<eos> The loss of him, his life... Is a stain on my soul. I-I can't bear it.<eos> Father has a plan.<eos> We must trust in that, Gabriel.<eos> His plan is perfection, but they will pervert it.<eos> Destroy it.
Corinth, Jessiah, Tusla,<eos> Winow, and Getrin.<eos> You're very blessed.<eos> Such a large family.<eos> - I too, had a son once, many years ago.<eos> He was a beautiful boy, so good.<eos> I raised him, loved him more than life itself.<eos> He died, fallen from a high place.<eos> I buried his body in a dirt field.<eos> My child was destined for great things, but an imposter stole his destiny, but didn't fulfill it;

Okay, which one?<eos> Oh, I... would go with the... blue one?<eos> Come on, I'm presenting my report to the CEO today.<eos> - It's a big deal.<eos> - Either one is fine.<eos> Gustaf: I wouldn't wear either of those.<eos> You need to peacock, like in the game. You know the book?<eos> Oh, I'm amazed.<eos> You read a book.<eos> No, someone told me about it.
Start to finish.<eos> It was that moment when it was like, oh hey, there's six seals, right?<eos> And then...<eos> "What?<eos> Here comes the seventh seal!"<eos> (Sighing) The beginning was also really good when it... when it started and you had no idea what was going to happen at that point.<eos> End was a little unexpected...<eos> You haven't seen it, have you?<eos> I will watch it tonight.<eos> I'll watch it tonight, I promise!
Okay, you have to leave now.<eos> - He's getting suspicious.<eos> - No way. Are you kidding?<eos> You told him you practically directed the movie, you don't think he's getting suspicious?<eos> I didn't say I directed it.<eos> I was very clear I was just an assistant director.<eos> Although in reality I think a little lot more than that.<eos> Oh my god, now you're starting to believe your own lies.<eos> It's called method acting, Bruce.<eos> All the great ones do it.
Because I didn't.<eos> Natasha, what is happening?<eos> Why are you being such a b today?<eos> Anyone over here have start mode?<eos> No?<eos> It's on my interface.<eos> But then again, why would you know how to work this ship's computer?<eos> You're only the captain.<eos> Snark mode off.<eos> You turned it on about an hour ago with your elbow.
He said Happy April Fools'...<eos> I heard him, Jimbo!<eos> Uh, I'm just a little confused 'cause<eos> April Fool's was weeks ago. McGEE:<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's when we thought of it, but took time to execute it. "We"?<eos> You were in on this, too, Jimbo?<eos> I want my money back. Mm.<eos> It's already down my scrubs.<eos> You wouldn't want it now.
We don't tell each other anything anymore.<eos> But... how, Ellie?<eos> What happened?<eos> It was him or me.<eos> And... as long as I keep reminding myself of that, I can also keep pretending that I'm fine.<eos> You should have told me.<eos> I could have helped.<eos> Then help me now.<eos> Let go of Korkmaz's computer.<eos> We need it.
Yes, sir!<eos> I could totally hook you up with some Lab Jams for the squad room if you want.<eos> No.<eos> Okay.<eos> Then how about we just dazzle you?<eos> Yeah, I like that.<eos> Yes, well, might I draw your attention to... the design on Bradley Simek's arm.<eos> It's not a tattoo.<eos> It's permanent marker.<eos> And the angle suggests that he drew it on there himself.

Yes.
No one.<eos> Okay.<eos> Off to Cairo.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Don't like that look.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Something's come up.<eos> Bayar?<eos> Yeah, the deal isn't gonna fly, Gibbs.<eos> DIA got wind of it. They shut it down.
What do you see?<eos> What's in there?<eos> What's in the secret room?<eos> Abby, quiet.<eos> Have a little patience.<eos> As soon as we clear the room, we will invite you to look.<eos> Bishop, follow me.<eos> Clear!<eos> Whoa. What happened in here?<eos> They bombed it.
Let's go.<eos> Not sure why you care so much about the girl.<eos> It's me you want.<eos> Wipe the smile off your face.<eos> You got a lot to answer for, Baitfish.<eos> Well, I told you, I'm not your Baitfish anymore.<eos> You see that now, right, Dwayne?<eos> I deserve respect.<eos> I have a name.<eos> Why don't you say it?
His wife and children were burned to death.<eos> Shortly after, he started the Niger Delta Renegades in hopes of taking revenge on the Western energy sector.<eos> He began with attacking oil tankers, and when he didn't get results, he bombed the USS Allegiance, killing five sailors.<eos> Hanson's his first victim on American soil.<eos> Our job is to make sure it's his last.<eos> Get me a list of potential targets and any chatter.<eos> Coming from the Renegades-- got it.<eos> Focus on the last six months.<eos> So Ekpo and Turay were in the container,<eos> Hanson opens it, and one of the two Nigerians slits his throat.

Robert, what cave Did you crawl out?<eos> Hello, Debbie. How is New York?<eos> It is not as healthy As Storm Lake.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Well, I am going to be late on the pages.<eos> It will take me a couple more days.<eos> In addition, I want to cut the fourth chapter.<eos> I read it last night.<eos> I think it is unnecessary.<eos> I will pass it along to the publisher.
Hey!<eos> Clean and sober six days.<eos> Mazel tov.<eos> I made the dean's list.<eos> And I hate you both.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> 20 years of therapy, and all it took was an hour and a half with you two to make me love my mother.<eos> He certainly has a lovely condo.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Shame we'll never see it again.
Understood by whom?<eos> Well, the two sets of parents.<eos> How romantic.<eos> But you like him?<eos> You wouldn't ever want to find something else to do?<eos> I'd hate to leave Brancaster. And I'm very fond of Cousin Peter, even if he isn't a countryman.<eos> He hasn't a nasty bone in his body.<eos> What are we doing this evening?<eos> Have I got your evening too?<eos> Come to my flat for a drink, I'll show it to you.
A creature of secrets that she never reveals.<eos> Rather like Granny Violet.<eos> - What time will you get there? - Mm?<eos> - On Friday?<eos> - Well, not much before 8.<eos> I want to be in possession of the room by the time Mr Chamberlain arrives.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> - Bad news?<eos> - Oh, dear.<eos> I wouldn't have brought it if I'd known.
I'm sure it's only indigestion, but whether it is or not, I'll be glad to put my feet up.<eos> It's too late to cancel, but I'd manage without you if you're ill.<eos> Mama would only say I'd ratted on her.<eos> No.<eos> As you say, I'll get through it, and then lake things quietly for a few days.<eos> - How did that happen?<eos> - I threw a book and it caught it.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> The red one.<eos> Why did you throw it?
Something you won't believe.<eos> Loo, I've been around the world, okay?<eos> Whatever it is, I'll understand.<eos> There is nothing about this I understand.<eos> It's a trans-universal gateway, a punched hole through a weak spot in our dimension.<eos> I created it to unlock the mysteries of the universe.<eos> But it could just as easily be harnessed for terrible destruction!<eos> That's why I shut it down and hid my journals which explain how to operate it.<eos> There's only one journal left.<eos> And you are the only person I can trust to take it.
Meanwhile, where have you been?<eos> Living it up in your fancy house in the woods, selfishly hoarding your college money, because you only care about yourself.<eos> I'm selfish?<eos> I'm selfish?<eos> Stanley, how can you say that after costing me my dream school?<eos> I'm giving you a chance to do the first worthwhile thing in your life,<eos> - and you won't even listen.<eos> - Well, listen to this.<eos> You want me to get rid of this book?<eos> - Fine, I'll get rid of it right now.

- You're welcome.<eos> I told you what my father said.<eos> You have to ask him again. You have to make him tell you.<eos> He looked at me and said that there was no such person as Charles DiLaurentis in our family.<eos> Ali, your father is lying to you!<eos> A didn't just pick that name out of the air.<eos> A is for Andrew.<eos> Then why put the name Charles DiLaurentis right in front of us?<eos> Hidden, but hidden just enough.<eos> Why did he want us to find it?
Sara's upstairs.<eos> Em, get in the car.<eos> We're gonna go see Dr. Sullivan.<eos> Dr. Sullivan?<eos> Yeah, I'm declaring an intervention.<eos> If you wanna talk to her, that's your business.<eos> No, it's all of our business and you know that.<eos> Well, I can't, I have to take care of Sara.<eos> Good, you got the text.<eos> Yeah, I got it.
Wait, so before he was a Campbell maybe he was a DiLaurentis.<eos> You probably heard, my dad is trying to decide how many people he can sue at one time.<eos> It's the kinda challenge he enjoys.<eos> I wanted to talk to you about him.<eos> About your family.<eos> Our family.<eos> Well, I don't think I've ever heard you refer to it as our family.<eos> Well, things change.<eos> 'When we were down there in that place, we saw a name.'<eos> We found it or Andrew wanted us to find it.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard.<eos> Can't say the same for this one, though.<eos> She's good.<eos> Seriously, she's okay.<eos> We're just looking to buy, Rodney, seriously, please.<eos> Both of us.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Oh, I'm just checking in, Mike.<eos> You're looking for a new case.<eos> Did you find it?
And if my mom ever found out I got a tattoo, she'd harpoon me.<eos> So get a small one.<eos> In a place she'll never see.<eos> What does this one mean?<eos> That is the Japanese symbol for courage.<eos> 'It's got your name on it.'<eos> No, but it could.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Could you hold my phone?<eos> Where do you want it? Um... Maybe right.... here.
Okay, so what's the plan?<eos> Are we gonna track down Lesli Stone?<eos> Are we gonna go to Philly?<eos> - I have to get my head shrunk.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> Wait, what is wrong with you people?<eos> A is still out there, we have to stick together and see if we can try and catch this girl in the act.<eos> Did you see who put this on my car?<eos> This card.<eos> Did you see who put it under the wiper?
Why haven't you talked to Emily?<eos> I've tried, but every time I bring her up,<eos> Emily shuts down.<eos> Do you think Alison knows who did this to us?<eos> Well, if she does, that person's not long for this world.<eos> I wish I had more answers for you, but... the truth is, I'm on the outside looking in too.<eos> I hate it.<eos> Hi, there.<eos> I'm so embarrassed.<eos> I thought I put my ticket in my bag but I can't find it.

Miss?<eos> I... I think I know the car.<eos> Ugh.<eos> That's it.<eos> Thank God one of us has a brain.<eos> - What's your ETA?<eos> - I'm almost there.<eos> Okay, well, there's an alley right when you turn right on Front Street, meet me there.<eos> Are you stealing her car?<eos> No, I am borrowing it.
Clark?<eos> Hi. What...<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Just came back to take some new pictures.<eos> Somebody stole mine this morning.<eos> Oh, Em, this is Clark.<eos> The photographer I met at Hollis.<eos> Nice to meet you. So what are you doing here?<eos> When I got home I-I realized I lost my tripod.<eos> I thought I must've left it here.
We're all missing it.<eos> You said we're just hanging out in Spencer's barn watching Molly Ringwald movies.<eos> - We could do that any day.<eos> - Yeah, you know what?<eos> You're right. It doesn't matter anyway.<eos> It's just a pity prom.<eos> What?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Why are you bringing an industrial strength laptop with you? Oh, um.. My dad wanted me to bring it.
Let's just take the time, so we don't get lost.<eos> - Before we start driving. - Yeah.<eos> They are going to look for directions because they don't have them, ok? Hi.<eos> We're trying to find how to get to Église...?<eos> Église Notre-Dame-de-l'Assomption.<eos> - Where's the map? - I don't know.<eos> - I didn't use the map.<eos> - Did you throw anything away?<eos> - No.<eos> - I think I gave it to you.
You know love. Do you see love here?<eos> They look great together.<eos> Friendship chemistry.<eos> I'm not having fun now.<eos> Just kind of over it.<eos> I want the day to be over with.<eos> All right, I'm hoping we're going the right way.<eos> All I can do is hope.<eos> Oh, there's a team right there.<eos> They haven't found it.
We go into lock-down.<eos> The bombing bumped the NTAS level to red.<eos> But why put the mission at risk by triggering a high-level terrorist alert?<eos> Well, that's the downside.<eos> The upside is exposure, public attention.<eos> Remember, the people behind this went to immense trouble and expense.<eos> What does that say about their target?<eos> He's high-value.<eos> Someone important.<eos> Oh, my God, that's why he did it.
Randall asked me to drop by this morning and discuss some financial matters.<eos> What sort of financial matters?<eos> Well, he left me a message, a voicemail yesterday morning, saying that he had found an investor.<eos> An investor for Cason's?<eos> No, we're opening another location downtown.<eos> We were looking for the last of the money.<eos> We didn't want to dip into our savings.<eos> You said Randall left a voicemail.<eos> Can we hear it?<eos> Well, I played it for the officer last night, but... here.
And it looks like it's having an effect.<eos> Maybe you could start by telling us what happened to your daughter.<eos> What did Dr. Henson do to her?<eos> Tuesdays, 4:00 to 7:00, Stephanie had a study group, a very unofficial thing with her friends, and so we... we let them u-use the pool house.<eos> My wife got home that night after I did.<eos> We cooked dinner, watched some television, then I got a headache around 8:00.<eos> I went to the medicine cabinet, and it was empty...<eos> Advil, Benadryl, my wife's Xanax... everything.<eos> W-when we were eating dinner, uh, Stephanie was lying on the floor in the pool house, all those empty pill bottles around her, including those dangerous antidepressants that Henson prescribed.<eos> She was clutching her phone like she was hugging it, the way she used to hold her little stuffed animals.
- Slider.<eos> - Well, be careful.<eos> Diving into Alice's life could open up some old wounds.<eos> It does.<eos> But for some reason, the more I-I learn about her, the more important Alice becomes to me.<eos> Yes. It works that way for us, too.<eos> It will help you to not exhaust yourself. I won't.<eos> Um, I just...<eos> I-I promised another post by tomorrow.<eos> And, um, I think I have it.
Oh, did you know that the cardinal is considered a matchmaker to the Choctaw?<eos> Something I don't give a shit about.<eos> You know the name Adam is used 47 times in the Bible?<eos> 47 is also the country code of Norway.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> Maybe the universe doesn't always hang signposts in a language that we understand, you know?<eos> Do you honestly believe that there's some purpose to all this?<eos> Mike, you were given a vision.<eos> I choose to believe that we are all put on a path.<eos> We might not want it, we might not like it, we might not even understand the shit, but still, our path is our path.
You shouldn't be in here, Johnny.<eos> We gotta talk.<eos> We will, soon.<eos> Ah, bro, hey, we're way past soon, man.<eos> I told you I'd help you get Lucia away from Carlito, and I'm handling it right now.<eos> I'm looking right at you, man.<eos> How are you handling it?<eos> You know, Johnny, not everything that's happening is happening in front of you.<eos> Catch anything yet?<eos> Longshoremen unloaded our shipping container about an hour ago, dropped it in stack 14.
- Whoa. No, no. - Hmm?<eos> How could I ever forget you, Ari?<eos> I know exactly who you are, and that's the problem, isn't it?<eos> Yeah, loose ends, it's bad business.<eos> But two things I am not are an idiot or a coward.<eos> I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder, waiting for your bullet to show up.<eos> When death comes knocking on my door, I'm gonna look that bitch right in the eye.<eos> There's no nobility in death.<eos> So what is the real reason?<eos> Let me break it down for you.
Give those to the Army.<eos> You can't even see the irony.<eos> Sitting in an American concentration camp, but you think the Germans are monsters, huh?<eos> Hitler's more merciful than you think.<eos> Not the first word that comes to mind.<eos> No?<eos> Any second, all this, this prison, this country, this life could just, poof! Go away.<eos> - What, more Houdini?<eos> - The wonder weapon.<eos> Hitler has a device that could bring the world to its knees, but he doesn't use it 'cause he's merciful.
I made a mistake.<eos> You're all right now, aren't you?<eos> Jesus, Glen, I can't do this without you.<eos> You're gonna have to.<eos> They want me off the Hill.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - Your husband is at another site proving his loyalty to his country.<eos> _<eos> Brought you a newspaper. Sunday "Times."<eos> They took it from me at the door.
What was science fiction yesterday is a reality today.<eos> Hahn and Strassmann work at the Kaiser Wilhelm Insti--<eos> - No, no.<eos> Turn that back, please.<eos> ...blocks of all matter.<eos> German scientists have managed to split the atom, releasing 200 million volts.<eos> A major discovery in physics, atomic energy could become a promising source of fuel in the decades to come.<eos> It's called a neutron.<eos> It's a particle inside the nucleus of an atom.<eos> When you bombard uranium with neutrons, you can split it apart, releasing all of that, uh-- that energy, that power that's locked inside.
Request for a Declaration of Taking Property 112,<eos> Ms. Maria Capo-Berryman,<eos> - Tract B-31 quadrant...<eos> - English.<eos> We need to buy this lady's farm so we can blow it up.<eos> The judge is a hard-ass.<eos> He wants to know why we're trying to stiff her.<eos> I thought this went away.<eos> She claims the land is worth $750.<eos> The Army appraised it at $744.
And I believe, given her mental state, that I left her no choice.<eos> Have you discussed this with your husband?<eos> No, sir.<eos> But what I did, it was pesha, a deliberate sin against another person, and it's the most unforgivable kind.<eos> And... it...<eos> That's why God took my child.<eos> And that's why you want to contact Miss Tatlock's family?<eos> To repent?<eos> I have money.<eos> I have more money than I'll ever need, and I would like them to have it.
If you say another word to anyone, you're dead.<eos> Your kid, too.<eos> You don't like hamburgers?<eos> You know, Hitler's a vegetarian.<eos> Fine.<eos> Do you like grilled cheese?<eos> Okay, I'll get you some.<eos> Linda taking good care of you?<eos> It's too sweet for me.<eos> I don't have the teeth for it, but go ahead and have it.

You did use 32 of them, right?<eos> Yeah, the detonators were the first thing I checked, Frank.<eos> Yellow, red.<eos> I'm not color-blind.<eos> Hey.<eos> All right... say you're me.<eos> Fun game.<eos> Got a beautiful young wife.<eos> Got my whole life ahead of me.<eos> You've built the most complex machine in human history and it might have an Achilles' heel. How do you find it?
Well, then for sure you should do this.<eos> You think?<eos> No!<eos> It's crazy!<eos> Isn't it?<eos> I mean, at first I thought, "cha-ching, easy money and it wouldn't even hurt," and then it's like, "where'd my egg go?<eos> "What egg?<eos> Who cares?<eos> I have a million more.<eos> I won't even miss it."
- Ros!<eos> Shall we make a start?<eos> As you know, I live on my own and once a week my sister comes over.<eos> Bit of a drive for her, but she brings the shopping.<eos> Meals.<eos> Soup, tomatoes, meat, onions...<eos> Yes.<eos> She was there on a Thursday.<eos> I had a headache that day, which isn't the primary reason I'm here.<eos> But now I mention it, I've had them for years. It's on your notes.
'All the preparation's done so, literally, a couple of weeks, that's what we're looking at to start.<eos> How long, then, until it's finished?<eos> Eight months.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Tea?<eos> Er, no, thanks.<eos> Biscuit, then?<eos> OK.<eos> I'll, er, bring the model in one day.<eos> You can see it.
Whatever's going on, some time off would be a good idea, wouldn't it?<eos> What did you tell the police?<eos> - What?<eos> - You said they asked about procedure? - Yes.<eos> - Something was said to them here to make them suspect me.<eos> All right, well, er, they asked about our access to pills.<eos> - And I told them what I found in your bag.<eos> - Why were you looking in my bag?<eos> I wasn't looking!<eos> I needed some hand gel and your bag was there on the side and open, and when I found it, I saw that there was... a bottle of sleeping pills with some anti-sickness medication.
Come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> Mm.<eos> Dad? Mmm...<eos> I'm still pregnant.<eos> You can't just walk away from him.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> We'll look after you and the child.<eos> You have a room here if you need it.
Okay, looks like she stopped at this building.<eos> Evelyn might still be in that building.<eos> What do we know about that place?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> We'll find out.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Hey, Ryan, you find anything in Sid's office?<eos> No, just paperwork and spreadsheets.<eos> So nothing that speaks to a possible kidnapping?<eos> Pretty straightforward stuff, but I'll bring it in so we can go through it with a fine-tooth comb.
All except for that one tiny detail that you could not have foreseen...<eos> Sid confronting you at the money drop.<eos> He recognized your ring, didn't he?<eos> That was when you realized your only way out was to kill him.<eos> You think I killed Mr. Ross?<eos> You can drop the act.<eos> We know what you did.<eos> Even Evelyn saw your ring.<eos> I-I bought this ring at the "S.N.T." gift shop.<eos> Lots of people have it.
Hands up!<eos> Drop the knife!<eos> Don't move!<eos> Looks like I got here in the nick of time, no?<eos> Don't look so surprised, Theo.<eos> I had a tracker placed on agent Hardy.<eos> When we want something, we get it.<eos> Ryan?<eos> I've been tracking the escape car.<eos> Picked it up on I-87 going north.
Don't look so surprised, Theo.<eos> I had a tracker placed on agent Hardy.<eos> When we want something, we get it.<eos> Ryan?<eos> I've been tracking the escape car.<eos> Picked it up on I-87 going north.<eos> I got it going through 3 toll booths, two bridges, at mile marker 244, and then at marker 245, it's not there.<eos> Obviously, he stopped somewhere, but where?<eos> I've got street view, traffic cams, eye in the sky.<eos> I can't find it.
Keep them away.<eos> Will do, and Theo's remains will be identifiable when you leave them for me to find?<eos> Of course.<eos> Your success serves us.<eos> We want you promoted at the bureau as much as you do.<eos> Max?<eos> We caught a break.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Theo ditched Barton's car and transferred to another vehicle.<eos> I've got it on I-87, mile marker 245.
We caught a break.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Theo ditched Barton's car and transferred to another vehicle.<eos> I've got it on I-87, mile marker 245.<eos> How did you know about that?<eos> I thought you were at the hospital.<eos> Yeah. I've... I've been working from here.<eos> There was a glitch in my video feed, so I went back, and I accessed the original source.<eos> The car swap was there, ok?<eos> Theo must have hacked into our system and deleted it from the file.
You're not taking this very seriously.<eos> You said, "we," before.<eos> You really don't want to disappoint whoever "we" is, huh?<eos> Is that what Theo did?<eos> The code.<eos> I hate torture.<eos> Me, too, especially when your subject doesn't have what you're looking for.<eos> I don't believe that.<eos> I think you left my penthouse and started asking questions.<eos> Did you task someone with it?
You dumb bitch.<eos> I was telling you the truth.<eos> I don't know anything, but I'm sure as hell gonna find out about you now.<eos> Go!<eos> I told you I was gonna take your future.<eos> Until a few minutes ago, I thought that meant killing you, but the universe has given me a gift... your child to be.<eos> Agh! After all, aren't children our true future, Ryan?<eos> On the bright side, Gwen will survive at least until birth, and then I'm gonna take your kid and make sure it's raised like I was, abused and neglected with no idea who you are... ha ha ha... a fate worse than death<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> Max got a lead on Theo's car and traced it here.
I don't think it's such a good idea right now.<eos> Youneedmoretime.<eos> No, dad, I think you need more time.<eos> You know, have a great fucking day.<eos> Hey, brother in recovery.<eos> Hey.<eos> You up for some fellowship?<eos> Got my pass.<eos> I got it.<eos> I got this cousin in Marina to sign off on it.

Um, graduating.<eos> What are you doing in a bathrobe?<eos> Miss Saxton, this breakfast is for seniors participating in the graduation ceremony.<eos> Since you were caught with a flask of alcohol at prom, you cannot walk with your class.<eos> We already discussed this at length.<eos> Come on, you weren't serious.<eos> Anyway, my name's already in the program, so...<eos> Oh, I am dead serious.<eos> Go home.<eos> This day needs to be perfect, and I will not let you not tarnish it.
Come here.<eos> Come on.<eos> Mom, we got to go.<eos> Where's the change for the penny harvest?<eos> - Today's the last day.<eos> - Today?<eos> Ugh. The jar is... somewhere.<eos> I told you about it, like, four times.<eos> We're gonna be late now.<eos> I'll bring it by school later.
You should know they are recently divorced.<eos> I don't have other people pick up Owen that often.<eos> Usually it's Fabiana, our nanny, or a friend's nanny.<eos> You sure that you didn't call anybody today, Mrs. Farhidi?<eos> - I'm positive.<eos> - Well, sometimes people forget.<eos> Let's just look at your phone.<eos> Maybe there's something in your call log.<eos> I can't find my phone!<eos> Okay, do you remember where you were the last time you used it?

It's been official a few months now.<eos> Are there any custody issues?<eos> Yes, huge.<eos> Sam is Iranian.<eos> He wanted to take Owen there over spring break.<eos> I wouldn't let him.<eos> Oh, no, you don't think that Sam maybe got someone from the restaurant to pick up Owen?<eos> Does your son have a passport?<eos> Yes, the judge ordered Sam to hand it over to me.<eos> Good, so you have it?

I'm not really sure where it is.<eos> I'm... I'm not even sure that he gave it to me.
- Keep her talking.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Incoming call on Dana's cell is a video request.<eos> Okay, not here.<eos> Uh, this way.<eos> Come.<eos> Here, up against the toys, right here.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Where you been, Dana?<eos> My phone... I didn't have it.
What about?<eos> School and stuff.<eos> He was nice till I wanted to go home.<eos> Then he made me get in a van.<eos> That must have been pretty scary.<eos> Mm-hmm. We drove around.<eos> I had to call my mom on his phone.<eos> Mm hmm... so Owen, let me ask you something.<eos> Who dialed your mom's number?<eos> Did you dial it or did he?
Who sent these?<eos> These texts came from your phone.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Is there anyone else who has access to your phone?<eos> No... I mean, sometimes Owen plays games on it.<eos> Oh, so Owen arranged his own kidnapping, right?<eos> Of course not.<eos> I left my phone at a yoga studio.<eos> Maybe somebody did it from there.
Sometimes he checks the smoke detectors for batteries.<eos> Does your dad ever maybe look at your mom's iPad or computer?<eos> You know, like when you guys are playing games, or... ?<eos> Um, no, he doesn't like me staring at the screen.<eos> Sometimes he takes my mom's phone away.<eos> Hold on, your mom leaves her phone at home when she goes out?<eos> She forgets things.<eos> Or sometimes I want to play on it, and she doesn't really notice it's missing.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, Owen, what does your dad do with your mom's phone when he takes it?
Are you going to the Durga puja carnival tonight?<eos> 20 rupees<eos> Put the watch in the hat<eos> Easy!<eos> Right inside<eos> Now it's inside<eos> Now blow into the hat<eos> The watch has... vanished!<eos> The watch will re-appear... in someone's pocket<eos> He has it!
You're clever.<eos> You'll find a way.<eos> Go in peace.<eos> Lift yourself a little.<eos> A little more.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Want this?<eos> You never call on your mother.<eos> Can't you at least call?<eos> If you're here for money again, Nasser has it.
Madam?<eos> Mr Fazli?<eos> Mr Fazlil<eos> Hello. How are you?<eos> Thank God.<eos> Take this and give me backthe ring.<eos> Am I ajeweller?<eos> Pay rent next week or I'll sell that ring.<eos> I did you a favour.<eos> Don't spoil it.
Read the vows in a way nobody finds out.<eos> Thank you.<eos> First, only my sister was coming but other relatives are coming too.<eos> How can I do that?<eos> I explained her situation to you.<eos> Relatives won't ask why you don't sign the marriage document?<eos> We'll pretend to sign it.<eos> I'll make it up to you.<eos> You remember, surely?<eos> Write the temporary marriage certificate for one month, and we'll renew it every month.
Don't talk to me like that.<eos> It isn't about money.<eos> What is it about?<eos> Why are you so demanding?<eos> - I'll return your money.<eos> - No need.<eos> Just tell me how you spent it.<eos> I must know.<eos> Stop it, Mas'ood!<eos> I'll give it back.
You have your kid with you, but I am suffering.<eos> Didn't you say you'd get Amir Reza back?<eos> What happened?<eos> You have no worries any more.<eos> Why would you want another hungry stomach?<eos> I have enough to support 10 more kids.<eos> Tell me what you did with the money.<eos> Why you got work from Leila again?<eos> What I did with your money?<eos> You think I gave it to Ahmad?
Half pipe!<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes. That's good.<eos> 'Cause it comes...<eos> Hola, Ruxin.<eos> Taco Tuesday-- how do you like it?<eos> More like Tetanus Tuesday.<eos> I need my own personal meal.<eos> What, you got a problem with family style?<eos> That's how we do it up here.
Put it on speakerphone!<eos> We're lawyers, too!<eos> Hold on, hold on.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Go again. What do you got?<eos> Look at the cut-off hoodie.<eos> The scowl?<eos> Andre is G-dash-D Bill Belichick.<eos> I'm not giving up my phone.<eos> I'll destroy it for you.
that's what he wanted...<eos> to fill it with noise and people.<eos> You can build a house out of anything, make it as strong as you want.<eos> Okay.<eos> We have to dance it out.<eos> What?<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - Let's go.<eos> But a home... a home is more fragile than that.<eos> A home is made of the people you fill it with.
Kids have it tough nowadays.<eos> I mean, I'm just thankful I was never bullied.<eos> Dude, what did you just say? What?<eos> I'm not proud of this, but you were severely bullied by us.<eos> Oh, n-n-no, we all bullied each other.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Our nicknames for you became so popular the teachers started calling you them.<eos> Yeah, Miss Hamilton roll-called you as "Anal Bead."<eos> I actually thought your name was Anal Bead and your nickname was "Andre."<eos> I gave it back to you guys tenfold.
I mean, you're talking about people staring at me naked.<eos> I mean, do you know what it's like to be objectified for your body?<eos> No, I have no idea.<eos> I mean, all these children looking at my nude body.<eos> I don't see how sex offenders enjoy this at all.<eos> I'm taking this out of this book No, hey.<eos> I'm ripping it out.<eos> You can't do that, that's school property.<eos> This is my body, all right?<eos> And I'm taking it back.
It ends on a high note. Look at that rainbow.<eos> Are those... choads?<eos> Yes, they are choads, and your husband is juggling them.<eos> What you're showing me here is science fiction.<eos> I don't know anyone that juggles choads.<eos> I've seen two criminally insane people juggle choads.<eos> I can promise you, ma'am, it's not a laughing matter.<eos> I am not a choad juggler.<eos> The book tells a different tale.<eos> Well, Ellie made it up, okay?
I ache all over.<eos> Hurry, or we'll miss the Lord's sacrificial offering.<eos> Great Sage, let's go save the silly girl!<eos> I...<eos> I can't help you.<eos> I can't help! I can't...<eos> Great Sage!<eos> Great Sage!<eos> Look, I still have the Great Sage doll.<eos> Would you like it?
Now I'm sure we can get stronger<eos> I wonder<eos> Hey, It's Goku.<eos> Please Chi-Chi, allow me to go to train,<eos> No... I don't want to be alone because my granddaughter will be born..<eos> That is what Mr. Satan claims medal of the brave one?<eos> I do not understand very well but this is combat.<eos> Well, I will demonstrate my power of super Saiyan god<eos> Heroic Satan, Cause a Miracle! A Challenge From Outer Space!<eos> Don't miss it.
- "it can forget And forget easily " "but never forget That it's yours. "<eos> "My heart was So strong and proud "...<eos> - Good day. - Hello.<eos> Martin Kierkegaard.<eos> - We have met at the stadium.<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> Obvious.<eos> Have they started the apartment?<eos> Yes, I get my own contract here When i fill 18<eos> Jackie arranged it.
It alerts you when there's a match nearby.<eos> Wait, why do you have Yo Fellas?<eos> You are still getting married, right?<eos> I mean, Yolanda and I have been planning your bachelor party all morn th.<eos> Yes, the wedding's on.<eos> I just haven't deleted the app.<eos> It's not like I meet anyone.<eos> It's just nice to know I could.<eos> It's like car insurance.<eos> You never use it, but it gives you peace of mind.
Hey, Elliot, ah, meet Benji, Sofia's brother.<eos> He just came out of the closet.<eos> Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.<eos> That's your news.<eos> I'm just so proud.<eos> Wow!<eos> Congrats.<eos> Did you hear my speech?<eos> - No, sorry.<eos> I missed it.
Okay, look, it's Sofia we're talking about here.<eos> There's obviously some kind of mistake.<eos> Well, he slipped an envelope with $500 in her purse after they had sex.<eos> Maybe it was meant for someone else?<eos> - Was her name on the envelope?<eos> - No.<eos> - Was there a note?<eos> - No.<eos> So, the money could have been for anybody.<eos> He could have left it for housekeeping.
Oh, I know, thank you.<eos> You're a life saver.<eos> Elliot's going to be so happy.<eos> Well, there's a downside to everything.<eos> Let me see...<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> Oh, nothing really. I don't want to raise any red flags, but, ah...<eos> Have you seen a man's wedding band around here?<eos> You lost Elliot's wedding ring?<eos> Uh-ah! It's only lost... If I don't find it.

I'm a little confused.<eos> You were on your way to a very expensive cooking school that I wrote a very big check for.<eos> And now you stand before me... with a food truck.<eos> That has my name on it.<eos> I totally get your confusion, man.<eos> I was in a cab going to the airport.<eos> And I was thinking about Gabi when all of a sudden, I see this food truck for sale.<eos> I was like, "stop."<eos> I told the cabbie, "You pull over, cabbie!"<eos> And then I bought it.
Sam, you are gonna run the food, and, Jimmy, you and I are gonna use our physical strength to animate Nate's lifeless body.<eos> That does not sound simple, but it does sound awesome.<eos> - Do you think it will work?<eos> - Trust me.<eos> - I've done it before, twice.<eos> - I trust you, Mr. M.<eos> - You do?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I mean, this plan is classic Jimmy.<eos> I mean, if you hadn't have said it, I would have thought I did.
You ever hear of lumbar support?<eos> I get it.<eos> You like stodgy and functional.<eos> But these are my chairs, just like this is my case.<eos> What exactly are you doing here, Jessica?<eos> I'm here to tell you we're taking half the contingency.<eos> And I'm here to respond.<eos> I'm giving you 1/3.<eos> We brought this case to you.<eos> After you found it in a box crying for its mama.
What are you doing here?<eos> This is my home.<eos> It's also your office.<eos> And that entrance is right around there.<eos> Now if you'll excuse me, I'm in the middle of my dinner.<eos> I called to set an appointment. You didn't call back.<eos> Because I had patients.<eos> And what the hell am I?<eos> You're an ex-patient I haven't seen in weeks, who ignored me when I said that your panic attacks wouldn't stop until you accepted the fact that your secretary wasn't coming back.<eos> I did accept it, and I had another one anyway.
I want to give you time to finish your dinner.<eos> Is the car ready?<eos> It's downstairs warming up, like you.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, I received the invitation and couldn't help but notice that Dr. Barnes is in the program, and you're in the program too.<eos> Look at that, I am.<eos> Why didn't you tell me it was your speech?<eos> I wanted your honest opinion.<eos> But you didn't ask for my opinion.<eos> You asked me to check it for exposure.
In the meantime, I am gonna bat for you as best I can.<eos> I have convinced Riddle to reassess your rank further down the road, provided you complete some management training.<eos> [chuckles]<eos> "Leadership Hub of Chicago presents:<eos> Getting Troubled Managers Back on Track."<eos> This is a joke, right, Chief?<eos> This is how you go to bat for me?<eos> You have to register for that today.<eos> You know, Chief, I'll take the damn course,<eos> I'll take it and I'll get my bugle back, but I don't know that I can stay here and work under Patterson.
I'll get to the bottom of this.<eos> K-Trick... otherwise known as Kenny T. Reevis.<eos> He's a gangster Disciple.<eos> Not top of the pyramid, but he's got some corners.<eos> Brought up on racketeering charges twice, but the cases fell through when the witnesses dropped the charges.<eos> Finally got the analysis on the IED back from Bomb Unit.<eos> Whoever built it used a pressure cooker.<eos> They filled it with nails, screws, glass, some small-grade explosive.<eos> I think that's the same kind those guys used for the Boston Marathon bombing.<eos> Yeah, see, you hook it up to a cell phone, and ka-blammo... the shrapnel projects out, shreds everything in its path.
The rest of you get a bead on Reevis.<eos> Frankie!<eos> Yeah, look who it is.<eos> - The Celtic Tiger himself.<eos> - What's up, my man?<eos> This is my partner, Kim Burgess.<eos> - How's it going?<eos> - It's going.<eos> Did you get my message?<eos> Yeah. I didn't check it, though.
You didn't know he'd up the dosage about a hundred times more than necessary.<eos> Most of this lands on him.<eos> [door opens] Let's talk outside.<eos> (Mouse) It's Mason Brahmer, the owner of the cafe.<eos> (Olinsky) How come we didn't find this earlier?<eos> Some people cover their tracks better than others.<eos> Look, he spelled his name one letter off on his ID, making it virtually impossible to find anything on him.<eos> But I knew something was wonky, so I kept trying different versions until I found...<eos> "Ross Montag."<eos> Okay, see, he legally changed it a few years back.
I let you sleep in.<eos> You tampered with my phone. [Bunny scoffs]<eos> (Bunny) Everything's a conspiracy with you.<eos> "Tampered."<eos> You tied one on last night and I let you sleep in.<eos> You know, it was really nice, you talking about what's on your mind.<eos> But... what happened to Nadia is truly terrible, and if you want to talk about it, I am so here for you.<eos> Whatever I said last night, chalk it up to a whiskey neat.<eos> This coffee is insane.<eos> Did you heat it with a flamethrower?
How can I not?<eos> Boom!<eos> Uh, uh, well...<eos> These colors never run, hydra scum.<eos> My hand cannons couldn't even scratch the paint On that overblown ferris wheel.<eos> I know we can't run forever, but how can we keep fighting?<eos> How can we not?<eos> There was a moment, a long time ago, when I gave up, And the leader and skull built that weapon.<eos> It was only later that I realized, If I didn't stand up for freedom, no one else might.<eos> So I fought on for decades, often alone, To make up for that mistake, and I won't make it again.
Wow.<eos> Tough crowd.<eos> The signal's just up ahead.<eos> Fury told us to keep our distance.<eos> He told us to locate the power source.<eos> Until we lay eyes on it, this mission isn't over.<eos> The tracer.<eos> Dynamo tossed it!<eos> Must be long gone by now.<eos> Then why hasn't the snow covered it?
What is it?<eos> - Where's your friend Jackson?<eos> - Over here!<eos> Jackson.<eos> Ice cold.<eos> He's been dead for at least a few days.<eos> - What is this place?<eos> - It's Fort de Châtillon.<eos> It was built in the 1870s, from the Prussian War.<eos> They tore most of it down 40 years ago.
Be in touch.<eos> Just build that interstate, cabrón.<eos> What do you want?<eos> These.<eos> Sex Machine needs the map.<eos> He needs to start the search.<eos> Take them.<eos> You do realize that once you have the treasure, you can't open it without a key.<eos> Are we still talking?<eos> What if she finds it first?
Someone with a cock.<eos> I know why you want to find her.<eos> You want to start fucking her again, don't you?<eos> You're the one that shared her with me, Your Eminence.<eos> It's my way of keeping her in the temple.<eos> But you know what?<eos> I can give this map to el profesor myself.<eos> I don't even need you anymore.<eos> I built your flesh business.<eos> And now that she knows you're using it to feed, she'll attack again.

Ain't nobody taking' this one away from me.<eos> Okay. Eddie.<eos> Eddie... nobody's taking anything away from anybody.<eos> But that formerly living person right there said Richie was trying to do a deal with the Browns, however... politically incorrect that sounds.<eos> And you've been tracking said Browns, am I right?<eos> I mean, what is this shit?<eos> You got Alvarez, 120K,<eos> - Garces 95K, Greely 150K.<eos> - That ain't a Mexican name.<eos> Jesus Christ, Eddie. You're tracking a score and Richard's onto it.
Then my blood. Aah! Brown Jenkins?<eos> My father's book... My father's blood.<eos> Child, what is this?<eos> Secrets are meant to be kept.<eos> No!<eos> I only meant to say, little master, your memories are your own, as is your destiny.<eos> It's best you keep both to yourself for now.<eos> You can come out now.<eos> Well, just because you cannot see the world that lies beyond the horizon does not mean it's invisible.<eos> Eventually, we will see it.
I see I underestimated you.<eos> I'm glad that you learned something from me, but it's all too little, too late, I'm afraid.<eos> It is over.<eos> I want my son.<eos> You would not dare harm my relict.<eos> You know what I would do to him and to you. Unh! Do not do anything hasty that you will spend eternity regretting, Mary.<eos> For he is already lost.<eos> I feel the presence of my love inside him.<eos> Nothing is lost if he yet lives.<eos> Fire runs through my veins like blood, and I will burn it before you even have time to blink.
The top 1% of the top 1%, the guys that play God without permission.<eos> And now I think they're following me.<eos> This is about last night.<eos> I should've gone to Angela's birthday party.<eos> Instead, I went to...<eos> Hey, Ron.<eos> There you go.<eos> You're Ron.<eos> But your real name is Rohit Mehta.<eos> You changed it to Ron when you bought your first Ron's Coffee Shop six years ago.
We are now the Zygon High Command.<eos> All traitors will die.<eos> Truth or consequences.<eos> So, we have a Zygon revolution on our hands.<eos> - We need to open negotiations.<eos> - I'm not negotiating with them.<eos> As far as they're concerned, everyone's a traitor.<eos> If you're not going to negotiate, what are you going to do?<eos> They're holed up in this settlement in Turmezistan -- it's where they've taken Osgood.<eos> I'm going to order Colonel Walsh to bomb it.
UNIT HQ.<eos> Under the Tower of London.<eos> - Where, specifically?<eos> - The Black Archive.<eos> - Ah, yes.<eos> The dark little storage facility for forbidden alien tech, where this all began.<eos> Who has access to it?<eos> The Osgoods.<eos> Only the Osgoods?<eos> The Doctor sealed it up after the last time.
Me?<eos> Of course I understand.<eos> You mean, you call this a war?<eos> This funny little thing?<eos> This is not a war!<eos> I fought in a bigger war than you will ever know.<eos> I did worse things than you could ever imagine.<eos> And when I close my eyes... .. I hear more screams than anyone could ever be able to count!<eos> And do you know what you do with all that pain?<eos> Shall I tell you where you put it?
Authorities have been trying to locate the whereabouts of the mysterious masked man as well as other members of the fsociety collective.<eos> The investigation is still underway.<eos> The FBI Cybercrime Division is working with...<eos> Where's my bag?<eos> I need my bag.<eos> It... it has all my papers.<eos> I put all of your talking points on these index cards<eos> - so that you wouldn't have to... - God damn it!<eos> Will you please just give me my bag, for Christ's sake?<eos> I asked you to keep it close by.
Well... it's insane.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The inmates are loose around here.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> If that was...<eos> too cruel.<eos> Listen, they're, uh... they're closing up, so we have to get going.<eos> I'm not an idiot.<eos> All right?<eos> I'm not gonna just give my money to some stranger on the promise that he's gonna deliver it to some mysterious insurgency just 'cause he asks for it.
I need to know what time he left, who he was with.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I'll just check my logbook, shall I?<eos> There is no logbook.<eos> So... you don't remember him?<eos> Erm, mid-20s... shorter than me, bit of a gob on him, kind of pasty?<eos> After a while, all the short, gobby, pasty backpackers just blend into one.<eos> You got a problem with the work?<eos> Yeah.<eos> As it goes, I didn't ask for it.
At one time, every piece of paper money was backed by gold.<eos> Remember, for every 20 dollar bill, there was $20 worth of gold in a government vault.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Today, governments create currency by first creating bonds or treasury-bills.<eos> These bonds are sold in the market, generating funds for the government that issued them.<eos> Large banks buy U.S. bonds to flip them, selling them to the Federal Reserve at a profit.<eos> This is the magic money machine.<eos> You see, the Fed is America's central bank.<eos> But it doesn't have any money, no cash on its balance sheets.<eos> When a bank buys a bond and takes it to the Federal Reserve, the Fed simply says
Technical engineer.<eos> OK, would he be capable of extracting the polonium?<eos> Yes.<eos> Of course.<eos> That is, if we ignore the fact that he hasn't worked at the plant for years.<eos> Mason's taken two trips to Belgium a month for the past year and a half.<eos> He definitely had the opportunity.<eos> What if Korsten was teaching him how to extract the polonium?<eos> That's why Mason's been going to Belgium, for lessons.<eos> Mason steals the polonium, he gives it to Fazio, Fazio smuggles it across to Korsten.
I just wish I could have stopped him.<eos> Made him answer for what he's done.<eos> You tried.<eos> You were doing your job.<eos> Well, now that everything's out in the open I have a more personal stake in the outcome.<eos> I got a buddy on Tanner's team.<eos> I'll make a call.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> I've got one good arm.<eos> I'll use it to dial.
"Superficial charm?"<eos> 'After everything I've heard on the news' it almost sounds like a compliment.<eos> Is all this what the profiler thinks about my brother?<eos> Your brother.<eos> And you can recognize his baby rattle?<eos> It's actually mine.<eos> There was a whole christening set from my godparents.<eos> Pieces were lost.<eos> I still have the hairbrush.<eos> We found it along with a few other personal effects in the bunker.
You said they were called the Collectors.<eos> Oh, they are now.<eos> They used to be the Dissectors.<eos> Did a bit of rebrand in the '80s.<eos> Same people who did new Coke.<eos> Ah, look at this.<eos> More species for our collection.<eos> - Seize them!<eos> - Hayley, run!<eos> I looked everywhere for Snot's hamster and I can't find it.
If we can make it there, we're home free.<eos> You're doing great, baby.<eos> Tranq guns!<eos> Look out!<eos> Good job, honey.<eos> We are some kind of team.<eos> Well, looks like they've decided to put us in a private room.<eos> Let the anniversary begin.<eos> I'm not kissing you, you jerk.<eos> This was supposed to be our anniversary, and we're spending it in a...
Li Quan, come out.<eos> He is shy, but love good fart joke.<eos> Li Quan take "American Dad!" show from U.S.<eos> And move it here to China.<eos> Now, you talk.<eos> You must say something.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh, TV show now called "American Chinese Dad!"<eos> Uh, program is 1,000% better.<eos> He go and improve it.
That's a personal promise.<eos> Neil?<eos> He's lying.<eos> You really have to stop doing that, Victor.<eos> He can't promise you anything.<eos> I mean, there's no reward without risk.<eos> Maybe you're better off staying where you are.<eos> Change can be dangerous.<eos> When you reach for the brass ring, there's always a chance that you'll miss, and fall flat on your ass.<eos> But if you grab it,
What kinda sales?<eos> Commodities.<eos> I want to know about this cancer.<eos> I want to know what the doctors are telling you.<eos> Oh, they're all a bunch of assholes.<eos> You know, I thought he might have grown up to be a doctor at one point.<eos> Do you remember that thing with the cat?<eos> What was his name, the one out at the country house?<eos> No, wait, Simon was six.<eos> This cat drags in a mouse, drops it at his feet.
Hate to break it to you, but I like what I do.<eos> In fact, I'm expanding my business.<eos> Gonna partner up with somebody.<eos> You being in that business is me being in that business and I'm not going to have the family name brought down like that.<eos> I haven't been a part of this family in ten years.<eos> You don't get to make decisions like that for me anymore.<eos> How much do you need?<eos> I don't want your money.<eos> I make my own.<eos> I'm not going to give it to you, I'm going to hire you.
Sounds like a leggy blonde I know. Care for an "eye d'oeuvre"?<eos> - Eye d'oeuvre?<eos> - Yeah, they're for the party.<eos> It's mozzarella, a little black olive, and a touch of food coloring for that creepy, bloodshot look.<eos> Are you seriously going ahead with the party?<eos> Uh, funny story.<eos> I may have accidentally told a couple of people about finding Devon's house, and then, one of them may have group chatted the address.<eos> Come on, it'll be fine.<eos> It's just one night.<eos> And besides, the whole place is in limbo until the state claims it.
You're wrong, sir.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I said, "you're wrong."<eos> In every case you have referenced, I have not only successfully brought the killer to justice, but I did so with the utmost respect for the law and for the department I represent.<eos> And regarding my relationship with Mr. Castle, he has proven to be a brilliant partner, and he's always had my back.<eos> And as for his... fictional representation of me,<eos> I'm proud to have been his inspiration, and I am proud to be his wife.<eos> You asked, "how do I expect to lead?"<eos> By continuing to fight for what's right, not for what's easy.<eos> My job is to protect the citizens of New York, and I will do it by doing my job better than anyone else and getting results.
It's a gay dance, right?<eos> This is stupid. Can we just go?<eos> If you want to leave, then just go.<eos> Whatever...<eos> But I'm gonna stay.<eos> I'm having a good time.<eos> But you know, I'm gay, so...<eos> Seriously, you signed your name to a Bach fugue? Wow! I only recognized it because I wrote my thesis on Bach.<eos> I know that, Teri.<eos> That's why I picked it.
I mean, she's always been so sweet.<eos> Um, once we were at the pier, and Lena accidentally let go of her balloon,<eos> - and she just sobbed.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I remember that!<eos> I was gonna get her another one, but that wasn't why she was crying.<eos> She said that she was afraid that it would land in the ocean and choke a dolphin to death. Aw!<eos> Our Lena has always been very sensitive.<eos> Actually, I didn't lose it... the balloon.<eos> Nate took it from me, and let it go to make me cry.
She's gonna hate me.<eos> Oh, my love. You know what?<eos> We all do things that we wish we hadn't.<eos> But we learn from them, and if we... manage not to repeat them... Man, it feels really, really good.<eos> No, thank you. No! Thank you!<eos> Thanks!<eos> What are we gonna tell moms?<eos> I mean, by the time we get home, it's gonna be so late.<eos> I'll buy you another keyboard.<eos> It's not like I need it anyway.
Why do you say that?<eos> 'cause she asked me if it was okay.<eos> Oh! What did-- what did you say?<eos> That it's fine.<eos> Is it?<eos> I mean, it's kinda weird.<eos> My sister and my ex-boyfriend.<eos> Hey!<eos> Where's my phone?<eos> I haven't seen it.
Agree, agree, agree. Hmm. "Sociopath."<eos> What's that?<eos> Ay, carumba!<eos> That's what they think I am?<eos> Fine!<eos> I'll pretend to be the biggest sociopath in the world!<eos> And I only need to change three answers.<eos> Is he nuts? I don't know. I mean, he looks nuts, that's for sure.<eos> So, here's your test.<eos> Call me crazy, but I enjoyed it.
Bogdan is Mrs Yount's joke.<eos> Bogdan the builder.<eos> It's not so funny.<eos> No.<eos> But if I'm being paid to rip out your shower, and replace it every six months,<eos> I would laugh at all your jokes, believe me.<eos> I love bad chicken.<eos> I love bad chicken!<eos> - SHE GIGGLES - What does he mean?<eos> That's what Arabella calls it.
And so, suddenly, money is no object.<eos> The resources and the permission needed to look at somebody's internet records is no problem any more.<eos> No problem at all.<eos> What we found out was this -- that all the initial traffic setting up that blog, "We Want What You Have", came...<eos> - What?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Came from your IP address.<eos> Not your laptop or your phone.<eos> Still, who's to say you haven't got a tablet or phone stashed somewhere?<eos> You've got no evidence for the terrorist stuff, so you are just finding a case that's happening, and throwing it at me.
What do you want me to say?<eos> Aesthetically, you're in the clear.<eos> Legally, you're in the shit.<eos> You know what?<eos> Smitty was an accomplice, if you think about it.<eos> - He provoked me.<eos> - Yes, but he didn't actually, technically know you were doing it, did he?<eos> He gave me a challenge.<eos> A test.<eos> And I just, you know, I ran with it.
I could buy that cottage for my parents.<eos> Nobody would lose.<eos> Mrs Leatherby doesn't know she has the money, she won't miss it.<eos> - She's rich anyway.<eos> - It's not yours. You take it back.<eos> Now?<eos> Right now?<eos> Right now!<eos> £100,000.<eos> Where did you find it?
Really?<eos> Whatever, I like liking' things.<eos> Peter, when is Lois's birthday?<eos> Uh, let's see, when is Hitler's birthday?<eos> April 20.<eos> Wow.<eos> Okay, Noel.<eos> Yikes.<eos> Joe, what is Bonnie's favorite food?<eos> Well, she must like ground glass, because I keep finding it in my food.
Nearby, terribly wounded soldiers quietly awaited their turn to board.<eos> For those who sailed from the besieged ports, their prayers appeared answered;<eos> for those left standing behind, their doom seemed sealed.<eos> Many men, "in a surge of madness," shot themselves.<eos> Crazed mothers, with starvation gnawing and the red terror looming, found cyanide and poisoned their children, then themselves.<eos> Old people merely crawled into snow banks, fell asleep, and never awoke.<eos> Unfortunately, for thousands of refugees, there was no escaping the nightmare, even at sea.<eos> While many refugee ships successfully traversed the treacherous Baltic, Allied bombers were often the first to greet them when they docked.<eos> At Swinemunde in northern Germany, the arrival of a freighter loaded with evacuees coincided almost exactly with an Allied air raid.<eos> Hardly had the ship docked when a direct hit sent it to the bottom, taking 2,000 screaming passengers with it.
Harrison, wait!<eos> If we use your stuff you'll get a credit.<eos> We're not stealing.<eos> This thing has bulldozed my life.<eos> You want my research?<eos> You want my sources?<eos> I want a byline.<eos> A byline or I walk.<eos> All right.<eos> If we use it, you get a byline.
The boss said not to hire them.<eos> Wait here, I'll get u paid.<eos> For!<eos> - Hi Grandma. Where do you go?<eos> - Come on up.<eos> ... 40, 80, 100, 110, 115th<eos> I'm paying for the week out yesterday that we did not end.<eos> I did not want to fire her, but had no choice.<eos> It does not depend on me, is my boss.<eos> When your child improve, you can have it.
That must stick in your craw.<eos> Did you get a look at the place?<eos> Did you?<eos> Come on.<eos> Check it out.<eos> Viewing and services in the chapel there, refreshments served here.<eos> Embalming and brain-harvesting in the basement.<eos> It's got great flow, don't you think?<eos> I've been meaning to ask you.<eos> After our last encounter, you might recall it as the night you shot me, I was watching the coverage of the gunfight at the Meat Cute corral, and guess what I didn't see?
"Max Rager, Minimum Return."<eos> That was the headline in the Journal yesterday.<eos> I'm sure you saw it.<eos> Yesterday?<eos> Yesterday<eos> I biked up Buck Mountain, sailed back down in a hang glider.<eos> I had my breakfast, made love to my companion, sent her on her way.<eos> Then I took my Asian investors ballooning in wine country, I secured a deal which opened up Vietnam and Laos, then I jetted back home where I accepted a Chamber of Commerce innovator award.<eos> Gee, I guess I must've missed the Journal headline.<eos> Why don't you email it to me?
The kitchen, specifically.<eos> The goop in the sink? It's developed consciousness and opposable thumbs.<eos> So I showed up to train a new client today, and he was a zombie.<eos> What, like, blonde hair, pale skin?<eos> No.<eos> - He was normal-looking.<eos> Look, I can't explain it, all right, but I knew.<eos> I... My hair stood on end, my pulse was racing.<eos> Like a wild animal's fear instinct telling you to run.<eos> Look, I've experienced it once before.
Owner said it worked well enough to scare off the winos.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> [ Door closes ]<eos> Okay, Amira, here's what I need you to do.<eos> Since you're at the window, make sure the guy can't see you.<eos> Watch him, and as soon as he's gone,<eos> I want you to walk down to the mini-mart around the corner.<eos> It has a pay phone.<eos> I want you to use it to call...
But your conscience ends where the justice system begins.<eos> Understand?<eos> I'm prepared for what happens.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Captain, I want to tell you, but...<eos> Don't.<eos> The moment I learn the name of your witness,<eos> I'm putting her in protective custody.<eos> Better keep it to yourself.
Twizz?<eos> Does that stand for "Emanuel," the guy Captain Raydor was putting into the Witness Protection Program?<eos> Could be, yeah.<eos> Twizz is Emanuel.<eos> Man, I want my phone call.<eos> You hear me?<eos> I want the phone.<eos> Flynn:<eos> Bon voyage, buddy.<eos> You think he bought it?
She's already gone to the press.<eos> Hold it together.<eos> We're all struggling here... but I'll take you over a roomful of those goons.<eos> Prove me right, yeah?<eos> - The DAC is on his way up.<eos> - He...<eos> Sod off.<eos> Good book?<eos> It's interesting, very interesting.<eos> I haven't finished it yet.
He died in 1892.<eos> He murdered nine, mostly by poisoning -- the last four, all prostitutes, in the space of seven months.<eos> Hanged here, in London, just a couple of miles away.<eos> Coined "the Lambeth Poisoner".<eos> He enjoyed...<eos> - .. the agonies of his victims.<eos> - Why are you telling me this?<eos> I'm not that.<eos> No, I don't think you are.<eos> I've admitted I did it.
You haven't gone yet.<eos> You need to feed Stevie's cat.<eos> Hello, Bridie.<eos> It was time to give the place a clean.<eos> Are you bedding down here now?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I'm just here to...<eos> - .. pick up the cat.<eos> - Right.<eos> I'd have taken it, only Frankie's allergic.
Please pace your questions.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For DI River, you must be feeling relieved today?<eos> I'm saddened for the family.<eos> Did you recognise him as DS Stevenson's killer?<eos> I mean, you witnessed her murder.<eos> But I couldn't positively identify the murderer.<eos> Yet you're certain that Mr Riley is a suspect?<eos> DI River?<eos> On... On seeing and approaching the car, DI River identified it as the same...
Admit it... you miss me.<eos> If that's a Dr Pepper, it's mine.<eos> Must have got stuck halfway down.<eos> It swallowed my quid.<eos> Ta.<eos> There are no images of Riley in the car until the day after Stevie was killed.<eos> Before that, he's always on foot.<eos> Sprawl of kids around him - running for him, it looks like.<eos> He's not got that car any time before Stevie died.<eos> So, who had it?
He's a soft boy.<eos> He's kind.<eos> And he was with you at the hospital that night.<eos> Is he the father?<eos> He'll make a good dad.<eos> I thought, this time...<eos> I thought, this time, with Bruno...<eos> He just wanted to get us a car.<eos> He didn't want me going on the bus.<eos> He didn't nick it until the next day.

Is she all right?<eos> Is she all right?<eos> Is it coming?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is it coming now?<eos> You have to tell me who you stole the car from.<eos> So, it was dumped here?<eos> People do it all the time, if it's a piece of shit.<eos> I came in early.<eos> Someone was dropping it off.

- We just have to... - Pretend?<eos> So?<eos> I had a second phone.<eos> Stop fiddling.<eos> You look fine.<eos> You pay inside.<eos> Over there.<eos> It's 15, inside and out. 15.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Technically, I unlocked it.
Hello?<eos> Yeah, Jules.<eos> I've been so worried about you, Frank.<eos> I tried to reach you a few times.<eos> Uh, but there's no phone at the campsite, is there?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Uh, there isn't.<eos> You know, you left your necklace.<eos> I figured if you saw it, you'd know I left.
I'm sorry.<eos> - Get away from me, Frank.<eos> - Please, Bill.<eos> - Bill!<eos> - I said get the hell away from me!<eos> Listen up!<eos> When I'm done, tie him off.<eos> Leave him here.<eos> You understand?<eos> Nobody cuts that body down till the birds pick it clean.
We'd like you to do that for us now.<eos> I'll open it and give you what's inside, no problem.<eos> But only in exchange for something in your possession.<eos> How about in exchange for your life?<eos> No deal.<eos> A man with nothing to lose.<eos> Okay, listen, 'cause I'm only gonna say this once.<eos> I've already lost a friend, and it may sound strange, but to get her back, I need to understand the properties of an ancient monolith.<eos> Now, I've learned it was buried in the Yucatan after being dragged around the earth for a few hundred years.<eos> And originally found with it, were artifacts...
But if this is an outbreak, shouldn't the public be made aware?<eos> I think we should be careful, the words we start throwing around.<eos> The last thing we need is panic in the streets.<eos> Any threat will be eliminated, I can assure you.<eos> People have a right to know.<eos> Are the infected among us?<eos> Thank you.<eos> That'll be all for today.<eos> I've lived with a secret before.<eos> I was miserable until I came out with it.
Send.<eos> Ah!<eos> Damn autocorrect.<eos> It changed "Doc gave me meds" to "Dog gave me AIDS."<eos> Let me juuuust...send.<eos> Damn it!<eos> "Dong gave me AIDS."<eos> Let me juuuust...<eos> It appears vaudeville is alive and well in cyberspace.<eos> My penis feels weird in this, Roger -- like everyone can see it.
You're actually not mentioned in the article.<eos> I'm... just joshing.<eos> Trying to lighten the mood.<eos> Some jokes.<eos> Yum, yummy vaginas.<eos> Right, boys?<eos> Who would publish such lies?<eos> Well, it must have been that muckraker Scoops LePue.<eos> You've been lurking around our family for months.<eos> I didn't write it.
No! Stop!<eos> Don't play that video.<eos> The captain and I cannot hear that.<eos> Listening to that video could cause us to recuse ourselves from the trial.<eos> Which would further damage the prosecution.<eos> As the D.D.A., right now, I'm the only one here who can listen to what Slider said to you.<eos> And I'm gonna need your cell until we can find time to see the judge tomorrow.<eos> Oh... n... no, you're not, like, you're not taking my phone.<eos> Don't you need a warrant for that?<eos> Not if you just give it to her.
Keep it there, right there.<eos> Sorry, we're investigating the homicide of Christa Cook.<eos> And we have a warrant to take all of your computer equipment.<eos> So we'll be doing that starting right now. Oi!<eos> Oi!<eos> You can't take that!<eos> I'm in the middle of a very important photoshoot here.<eos> No, sir, you're at the end.<eos> We have a car waiting for you outside.<eos> So cancel the rest of your day, 'cause you're spending it with us.
We have a deputy D.A. waiting.<eos> But first, you need to make a list of all the people you were spying on.<eos> And the list needs to be complete.<eos> You leave out even one person's name, and the deal's off.<eos> 42 women?<eos> ! This has been going on for years!<eos> I don't want to use his statement of facts, because this guy shouldn't have a deal.<eos> He needs to be prosecuted.<eos> Well, not for killing Christa.<eos> If he watched the murder, obviously he didn't commit it.
I heard that she saw him in the hospital.<eos> After examination the doctor said it's just psoriasis, not leprosy.<eos> As soon as your mother finds a place to live, they'll come for you.<eos> Man, I'm so happy for you!<eos> I am so happy!<eos> Soon I'll see my parents!<eos> Yes.<eos> That's great.<eos> A fish!<eos> Big brother, I caught it!
I would rather blow myself up.<eos> Why would Arshad play the Malians in every game?<eos> If he puts them on display, would he get more money when he sold them on?<eos> As a club owner, he'd profit from the sale of any of his players.<eos> Ellie,<eos> I need you to look into Victor Arshad.<eos> Personal, business, whatever you can find.<eos> Sit.<eos> Djablani, from the Baobab tree.<eos> My mother sends it for strength.
A guy?<eos> Would you happen to know his name?<eos> Andre or...<eos> Antoine.<eos> I overheard her talking on the phone once, but, she never told me his name.<eos> She kept promising to bring him around, to meet me one day.<eos> But she never did.<eos> In the statement that you made to The Hague police, you said that Miss Jensen entered the lavatory with an overnight bag.<eos> That's right.<eos> She kept it on her lap the entire journey.
So you admit you, uh... you were having an affair with her?<eos> I'm a married man, Inspector.<eos> But yes.<eos> Your affair started while her sister was a patient here?<eos> No.<eos> Not until several months later.<eos> Ran into her at a bar.<eos> One thing led to another.<eos> Until she ended it.<eos> Why did she end it?
Me?<eos> You're the one who had to beat the crap out of some kid...<eos> I'm trying to solve a problem here, something you all walked away from.<eos> You're her godfather.<eos> - What kind of moral guidance have you been?<eos> - All I've ever done is watch your back.<eos> - And all I get is grief!<eos> - And so you should.<eos> You lost my retirement fund.<eos> Why in God's name I left it in your incapable hands!

- Right.<eos> - See you later.<eos> - Come round for dinner sometime.<eos> - OK, will do.<eos> All right. See you later.<eos> Yes?<eos> Hello, it's Joe's dad, India's granddad.<eos> Oh, right. Something wrong?<eos> No, no, she left her pullover.<eos> I've got it in the car.
It's what you do for family.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - This ain't The Godfather, Roy.<eos> He's only your bloody brother-in-law.<eos> She doesn't like me very much, does she?<eos> No, no, Jimmy, it's not that she doesn't like you.<eos> She loathes and detests you with a passion you can't even imagine.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> The guy will give you a package.<eos> You give him the cash and then you take it to this address.
- We always used to come here, didn't we?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> After you'd hit a van and were still high on it.<eos> - Untouchable. - (CHUCKLES)<eos> - Magic evenings.<eos> - They were, yeah.<eos> Before the knock on the door.<eos> I never want to hear that knock again, Jimmy.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> You get a brief to draw something up, saying that I'll agree to a divorce, then I'll sign it.
They're not ruddy doormats either.<eos> Oh, I'm glad you're still here.<eos> Me too, you silly moo.<eos> - When me and Jackie get divorced...<eos> - Hey, Jimmy, come on.<eos> When and if me and Jackie get divorced, and if anything happens to me, it might only be a few quid or a 12-year-old coat...<eos> - You haven't got a pot to piss in.<eos> - No, but I want everything to go to Jackie.<eos> Right, I've got a will and testament here, right?<eos> I want you to read it properly and make sure it's kosher.
I know it may not be a glamorous life, but it's a good one.<eos> You turned out pretty well.<eos> ♪ I'm not twisted, bitter, I'm not mad ♪<eos> Hey, man, I appreciate you coming out to do this. What's going on?<eos> Juliette's a huge fan.<eos> This is a big bucket-list thing for her to meet you.<eos> Her new single... over the moon.<eos> Oh, well, your new single is over the moon. It's awesome.<eos> Why, thank you kindly.<eos> Heard it first time two years ago at the Bluebird.

You can change the future.<eos> What I saw doesn't have to happen.<eos> Just do it. Please.<eos> Eight months ago, this man took over the smuggling of pearls into the mainland and killed all of his competitors in the process.<eos> We have eye witness reports that he's been seen on the island along with another member of his chapter.<eos> While we have more than enough evidence to charge you with pearl smuggling...<eos> Then let's see it.<eos> ..we don't think that you killed Dries.<eos> We think that this man, Ihaka Ngata, did.<eos> Either to protect himself or because the man he's working for ordered it.
My red dress.<eos> He said he saw me in that.<eos> So get rid of it.<eos> Just burn it then everything's fine. What?<eos> It's gone.<eos> It was here.<eos> I was wearing it when I arrived, last week.<eos> Kyle saw me in that...<eos> We'll find it.<eos> The maid probably took it to be washed.
There's no such spirit.<eos> He was real.<eos> Matikutu existed.<eos> He's playing us for fools.<eos> We cannot indulge him.<eos> My mind is open, that's all.<eos> You know, our stories have meaning too!<eos> We've taken the dress back.<eos> I'm going to destroy it, make certain the future he predicted can't happen.<eos> I've burnt it already.
Thanks, Peckham.<eos> I would drink an ocean for a guy like that.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Cheers!<eos> ALL: Cheers!<eos> Your back's going to break way before that wall does.<eos> I'm trying to leave my body.<eos> Send my spirit out like you did, in a coma.<eos> I can do that too.<eos> Matikutu reckons I can control it.
No, no.<eos> You can't get pregnant from pre-come.<eos> I got a buddy, this guy Donald-- him and his girlfriend were having sex-- same situation.<eos> She got pregnant.<eos> Now they got a kid. His name's Samson.<eos> Well, that seems anecdotal.<eos> No, no. I know this guy.<eos> He's a friend of mine.<eos> That's what anecdotal means.<eos> You take one example, and you apply it to everything else.
Can you guys bond somewhere else?<eos> I'm really alone right now.<eos> Grumpy McGrumperson over there.<eos> Sorry?<eos> The name is not Grumpy McGrumperson.<eos> It's Steve.<eos> Ooh, I'm hungry. Should we get something to eat?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> What about that place across the street?<eos> Yeah, should I look it up on Yelp, see if it's any good?
Worry not.<eos> Dark ones don't need sleep. Ohh!<eos> That's why I spun straw.<eos> Passes the time.<eos> You need a hobby... something to take your mind off all the terrible things you're gonna do.<eos> Do you like knitting?<eos> In case you haven't noticed, I'm doing good here.<eos> I'm helping Merida, and then when she's done with the wisp, it'll be my turn.<eos> The wisp isn't a toy you can share.<eos> She can't just give it to you.

I have to.<eos> Lovely.<eos> Now, all it needs is a little direction.<eos> A trinket from home.<eos> Now see me do what you weren't powerful enough to do yourself. Ohh! Ohh!<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> What happened is I'm not stupid.<eos> I knew you could open that portal, but I also knew it would weaken you.<eos> See, there's one thing our family does well, sis, and that's exploit pain.<eos> Now we're gonna take your portal, but we're not taking it to Oz.

Not everybody talks in metaphor.<eos> You know what chum is, son?<eos> Sure... blood and guts for riling up gators.<eos> That's right.<eos> So do me a favor.<eos> Chum up that water.<eos> Come on.<eos> Chum it. Chum it.<eos> I want to make a deal first.<eos> We catch a gator, I get to keep it.
If we're not at 100, we're writing fucking 70 and 80, why are we even doing this?<eos> Well, seems like you've really done the math on our relationship.<eos> You know what? I think I should go stay at Melinda's for a little bit.<eos> Oh, wait, so now you're just leaving? You're leaving the apartment?<eos> Yeah, because I'm 100% sure I don't want to be around you right now.<eos> Oh, my God, Cap. That game sounds horrible.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Seemed like a good idea at the time.<eos> I was actually psyched when I thought of it.
Andri, the weather forecast doesn't look too good<eos> The mountain roads snowed in<eos> How much further do we have to go?<eos> Shouldn't be more than 30-40 minutes<eos> But in this weather, God only knows<eos> Are you afraid, Agnes?<eos> Keep your hands on the wheel.<eos> And your eyes on the road<eos> This road can be dangerous.<eos> We need to get past it before it's impassable
_ _ What are those flames from?<eos> Natural gas.<eos> Just comes up with the oil.<eos> They're just burning it off.

And Gary decided that I was killing his buzz, and so he took off, you know?<eos> Sounds like Gary.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's sad, you know?<eos> You think you know someone, and then they... Go and do something like that.<eos> You still looking at Spinks' phone?<eos> Thought you'd be done by now.<eos> Need evidence to charge our suspect with murder, right? Huh. What is it?<eos> Number looks familiar.<eos> And Spinks dialed it the night he was killed.
Sure.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's go check out the cake.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hap, would you mind showing Jules around?<eos> With pleasure.<eos> You didn't get my text?<eos> I tried.<eos> He wouldn't have it, and any more excuses, he would have known something was up.<eos> You wore it.
I do.<eos> Taking jabs at me is his favorite hobby.<eos> Hey, Clifton, it's me.<eos> I may have found a way to make our fortune while we wait for the right piece of land to drill, okay?<eos> Picks and shovels, baby.<eos> That's how people got rich during the gold rush.<eos> And you know what?<eos> You know what our picks and shovels are?<eos> Tanker trucks.<eos> We don't drill the oil... we move it.
Gary said that if I didn't cover for him that he was gonna tell my father I was the one that gave him the rig codes, which I did not.<eos> And you're telling me all this now because...<eos> I'm tired of lying to you.<eos> I'm tired of Gary's threats.<eos> I'm tired of the blackmailing.<eos> I just... I want it all to end.<eos> Okay.<eos> So what if I tell you that I'm really not interested at all in putting Gary away for stealing that oil?<eos> I want him for Spinks' murder.<eos> Well, then I'd tell you that he admitted it to me.
I didn't want you to get your hopes up, you know?<eos> I mean, listen, baby, with everything that you've been through, all right, I just...<eos> I didn't want to... I didn't want to fail you again, that's all.<eos> So you lie to me instead?<eos> Yes, I know, I did. It was... it was stupid.<eos> Look, I messed up.<eos> All right, and we've been through hell with this whole ordeal between Hap and the baby. I mean, I've made some some bad choices. I have.<eos> I promise.<eos> So, I want the Briggs corporate logo projected up in that space right up in there.<eos> This is a big anniversary, so I think the decorations should be over-the-top. You got it?
Uh, the feds... They say they have a recording of you.<eos> Do you know what you said?<eos> I was talking that weasel Myron off the ledge, and I got careless.<eos> I must have said something inflammatory enough to land me here.<eos> Well, I've got a whole team working on your release.<eos> Carter thinks their recording of you is outside the scope of the warrant, so he's pretty confident that everything will get thrown out and all the charges dropped.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Hap, what about the FBI bug?<eos> It's probably still in the house.<eos> How do you think it got it in?
Where's Daria?<eos> Gone.<eos> She ran out of here screaming.<eos> What happened?<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> We're going home.<eos> - Claire, what is it?<eos> - New problem.<eos> There's a tunnel that runs underneath the Luxor directly into Vega.<eos> - Let me guess. The eight - balls found it?
Come on.<eos> - Answer the question.<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> "Yes, Seth.<eos> I made a deal."<eos> Yes, Seth.<eos> I... I made a deal.<eos> Okay?<eos> But it was for us, and it was a good deal.<eos> Carlos set it up with the boss. He...
I won't.<eos> None of us will know peace until Pasiphae is defeated.<eos> I can help you.<eos> How?<eos> It is the winter solstice.<eos> Pasiphae must travel tonight to the temple of Chthonia at Nemi.<eos> She's sure to be well protected.<eos> On the journey, yes.<eos> But the temple is the seat of Hecate's power.<eos> The goddess guards it jealously.
Perhaps the end is in sight.<eos> I actually believe it might be.<eos> I must leave soon, if I'm to return to the city before the curfew.<eos> I will walk some of the way with you.<eos> Let us hope that soon you will be able to return with me.<eos> The gods willing.<eos> - Take care, my friend.<eos> - And you.<eos> The bait is laid.<eos> Let us hope they take it.
Who's he talking to?<eos> Buzz, are you on with your watch commander?<eos> Buzz, Buzz, don't say "suspicious circumstances."<eos> Because if you say suspicious circumstances...<eos> Look what I found on the dresser.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Will do.<eos> First, the hair dryer in the bathroom was extremely wet.<eos> Well, maybe he electrocuted himself.<eos> Then returned it to its place on the counter and got back in the tub?
Typical marital spat, captain.<eos> Yammer, yammer, yammer.<eos> Captain, I found three empty packets of Epsom salt.<eos> I shudder to ask, but how is that relevant?<eos> Buzz, get the lights.<eos> You see, Epsom is magnesium sulfate, shows up under the ultraviolet.<eos> See, it splashed up on the curtains, on the walls, suggesting there had been a struggle.<eos> Buzz, you were right about the hair dryer.<eos> It was soaked in Epsom salt, indicating that it might've been in the bathtub.<eos> Then someone put it back on the counter.
Sacyr had won or was going to win a tender for some work in Toledo.<eos> -You witnessed that in the meeting?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -Could you be more specific?<eos> -No details were mentioned.<eos> Didn't they say, "Winning the tender requires compensation on your part"? Or in similar terms?<eos> No, it was much more subtle in the sense of "help with the campaign, we're helping you with this." That was more the tone.<eos> Do you have any other document in relation to this operation, apart from this one?<eos> I had the ID card of the person who signed but...<eos> You haven't got it or you can't find it.
I have half a mind to flame off an email<eos> - to those jackasses.<eos> - Oh, oh, big mistake.<eos> Never send an angry email.<eos> A profanity-laced, all-caps missive ended my marriage to Margo.<eos> It also earned me a visit from Homeland Security... who are very nice people just doing their jobs.<eos> Well, I agree.<eos> I once wrote Haskell a furious, incendiary email.<eos> What?<eos> I never got it.

Here's what it's going to take.<eos> - 25 mil over four years.<eos> - 17.5 over three.<eos> 20 over three, or we walk.<eos> 19 or I let you.<eos> - Done.<eos> - Done.<eos> Cut!<eos> Love that kiss!<eos> I think we have it.
There!<eos> You're crazy.<eos> I'm not going out there with that thing in the water.<eos> With the getaway route blocked off, this is it.<eos> Your boat's the only chance we have.<eos> I'll go first.<eos> No way, man. Let me go.<eos> No, no, wait.<eos> We're not fighting about this.<eos> I'll swim out there, I'll fire it up, and I'll bring it closer.
Have you gone mad?<eos> --She keeps touching other people's stuff!<eos> Go fuck yourself!<eos> What the fuck you think you're doing?<eos> I'll cut your face!<eos> Let it go, she's crazy!<eos> --Psycho!<eos> This is a nuthouse!<eos> Where's the ID card?<eos> I don't have it but I got all the other papers.
Don't be afraid.<eos> I almost forgot...<eos> It's important, isn't it?<eos> Not that important...<eos> I'll see you tomorrow...<eos> --Are you using my perfume?<eos> I'll call you back.<eos> Your stinky perfume?<eos> I don't think so...<eos> It smells way better than you and it's a gift from Ahmed, don't touch it!
You are gonna modify the DAT file.<eos> Put Colby's IP in there.<eos> You do that, you'll have set in motion the largest revolution the world will ever see. _<eos> Sources have confirmed the hacks were in part tied to Colby's terminal.<eos> Sir, step inside the car.<eos> Bonsoir, Elliot.<eos> "Give a man a gun and he can rob a bank, but give a man a bank, and he can rob the world."<eos> It's a bit of a silly expression, actually.<eos> A little reductive, but still...<eos> I like it, for the same reason most people hate it, because to me it means that power belongs to the people that take it.
Everybody liked him.<eos> Every cop in town knew robbie wheadlan.<eos> He was always out raising cain and causing trouble,<eos> Cutting class and shooting off bottle rockets.<eos> (man) robbie had a way of knowing about other criminal goings-on,<eos> So I said, "if you have anything about this carwash shooting,<eos> Now would be the time to use it."<eos> And he said, "I'll only tell you if you wear a sign<eos> That says 'kid sister.'"<eos> So I make a sign, and I put it around my neck,
I don't know if you guys are all interested in jazz guitar,<eos> But it's very, very beautiful.<eos> It's--it's, you know, very beautiful chords And arpeggios.<eos> So I put on my poison tape, swallow this live,<eos> And I put it on my favorite track,<eos> Which is track one, intro.<eos> And, uh, he didn't like that, and he turned it off.<eos> I made him pop out the cassette<eos> And put it back in his case, close the case,<eos> And put it back in his pocket.
He was, uh, especially eager to try this case,<eos> Because he made a bet with a rival prosecutor<eos> About who could get the most death penalties that year.<eos> Dupree was something to see.<eos> In his opening statement,<eos> He laid out how don was driven to kill<eos> After a terrible divorce.<eos> Uh, me and my ex-wife, we're actually very good friends.<eos> It was a very, uh, amicable divorce.<eos> I would describe it as immediately amicable.

There's talk that the gold never left, that it's hidden somewhere near the church.<eos> Big Bill's been looking for years now.<eos> I think Benny knows where it is.<eos> I asked him to make keys for me.<eos> He gave me this.<eos> I'll be damned.<eos> So that's why Big Bill hangs people for spitting.<eos> He needs bodies to bury so he can dig for gold.<eos> Without anyone knowing, yes.<eos> We find it, we leave.
Gift from Benny?<eos> There is more.<eos> If we find it, we leave, Hedges.<eos> We go anywhere.<eos> Lady, you ain't listening.<eos> I just got here.<eos> Benny.<eos> We have to talk.<eos> Listen to me, Benny.<eos> The gold you give me sometimes, where do you get it?
Lady, you ain't listening.<eos> I just got here.<eos> Benny.<eos> We have to talk.<eos> Listen to me, Benny.<eos> The gold you give me sometimes, where do you get it?<eos> It's, uh... i... it's mine.<eos> Oh, I think it is the slaves' gold, Benny.<eos> The one the sheriff wants.<eos> Little Bill told me he thinks your papa stole it.
Did he not, Benny?<eos> Where is the gold, Benny?<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - I don't... I don't know.<eos> - He didn't tell me.<eos> - You're lying!<eos> I don't think so.<eos> If he'd tell anyone, it'd be you.<eos> But she's right about your pa, now, isn't she, Benny?<eos> He melted the gold down and hid it.
Stay down.<eos> I said stay down.<eos> Shit.<eos> And you're not just a lady of the light, are you, Pinkerton?<eos> I saw you at the telegraph office.<eos> I didn't figure you was wiring your sweetie.<eos> Well, if you're gonna throttle me, you could at least buy me a drink first.<eos> Tell you one thing, you sure put your foot in a beehive.<eos> Harknett clan half runs this country... oil, coal.<eos> They don't have it, they buy it.
Harknett clan half runs this country... oil, coal.<eos> They don't have it, they buy it.<eos> - Did they buy you?<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> I'm helping you, aren't I?<eos> Tell me something.<eos> Killing that horse and then... killing Benny.<eos> Did it feel any different to you?<eos> All right, then.<eos> If you did see a gilt jewel box... I don't suppose you'd tell me about it, would you?
You're a good man, Harvard.<eos> Always have been.<eos> Better than you know.<eos> Could you do me a favor?<eos> Be careful.<eos> You, too, John.<eos> Cotton...<eos> I'll see you on the other side.<eos> You have the boy.<eos> I smelled it in the woods.
Thanks.<eos> Have you still got that stomach medicine?<eos> Oh, Simão, Simão.<eos> Your disgrace was having left this place.<eos> What am I to do?<eos> The women I get just screw my head up!<eos> Simão, Simão.<eos> The red one always wins.<eos> No need to feel sorry for me, because Santa Casa's Charity is on my side.<eos> All the money I lose, Santa Casa replaces it.
- He's turned one of my birds -<eos> Listen up, Vítor has a chaffinch that does about five or six songs.<eos> The bird is studying and singing them.<eos> But I've warned him. "That bird won't keep them songs!"<eos> No chaffinch manages to retain six songs.<eos> No, it'll forget half of them.<eos> Still, he's good, amazing at learning new stuff!<eos> You know, people tell you, "This bird is 'clean, ' no bad songs!"<eos> But he's only clean there!<eos> As soon as you put it in the cage -
Who wrote those?<eos> You can't just go into my accounts without a warrant or a subpoena.<eos> I know my rights.<eos> Look, you don't need a warrant to go through a murder victim's computer.<eos> Now we're decrypting some wire transfers.<eos> Holt was paying you.<eos> O-Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look, he paid me for some of the passwords for Dunlop's servers.<eos> He was going after the money, and... he was gonna give me a taste when he got it.
Nice shot.<eos> Told me to take the collar.<eos> I took the collar.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> Let's go, come on.<eos> Hey. What's up, Angie?<eos> The money.<eos> The-the drives that Leelah took from Holt helped me to decrypt more of the tape.<eos> I found your money.<eos> I found all of it. Oh.
The money.<eos> The-the drives that Leelah took from Holt helped me to decrypt more of the tape.<eos> I found your money.<eos> I found all of it. Oh.<eos> Wow.<eos> Does anybody know about this yet?<eos> I Th- - I thought you should be the first.<eos> You're brilliant, Angie.<eos> Now get rid of it.<eos> You can do that, right, so that nobody ever finds it?
- Enjoy the ride!<eos> Boulder!<eos> Big, big boulder!<eos> Max, grab on to Julia!<eos> - What are you gonna do?<eos> - I'm inventing a new sport!<eos> Oh, boy!<eos> Ernie!<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna explain the plan one more time, and I swear if you don't get it, I'll dump you in a tar pit myself!
Ernie.<eos> Max.<eos> Max again.<eos> Dino-Mom.<eos> Me, Dodger.<eos> Hey, come here a sec!<eos> You guys ever seen tracks like these before?<eos> - No.<eos> - They're all around the nest.<eos> Like something's been checking it out.
Hey.<eos> Whoa. What are you wearing?<eos> And why is your neck all red?<eos> So, did you girls pick up some food?<eos> Yeah, we were gonna get groceries, but the store was crazy 'cause they'd announced a tornado watch.<eos> Ooh. Fashion idea.<eos> A tornado watch. Silver lining... we were forced to get ribs.<eos> Ah, last time I had ribs, we buried a pig for six days.<eos> You know, it's supposed to be six hours.<eos> We were so drunk, we forgot where we buried it.
I was wondering if we could talk business.<eos> There's not really much to talk about.<eos> You're locked up for six fights.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Um... You mind if I...<eos> That's fine.<eos> No, I was... I was thinking more about sponsors.<eos> I mean, I thought I had some things lined up, Then they all kind of scattered after my last fight,<eos> So, there's that -- I need money.<eos> I need it fast, and I wouldn't bother you If it wasn't important, but it is.
He's taken.<eos> A pity.<eos> Do you have an appreciation for art?<eos> This painting was taken from me.<eos> So call LAPD.<eos> They have an art theft division.<eos> It's complicated.<eos> Meaning it was already stolen when it was in your possession?<eos> Like I said, complicated.<eos> But if you would return it, I would feel so very grateful, I would be obligated to help you.

This is the last place I wanted to see you.<eos> Then why bring me here?<eos> So you could keep your pension and your pride and count down the clock with some semblance of dignity.<eos> Mm. Like you are.<eos> That's not what I'm doing.<eos> No woman has gotten higher than the Assistant Director of Quantico.<eos> No woman.<eos> It doesn't matter what I do.<eos> Recruitment numbers are the largest that they've ever been, and I'm still here.<eos> The ceiling's only glass till you break it.
I'm already done.<eos> Simon's easy.<eos> I prefer honest.<eos> I have nothing to hide.<eos> Hey, um... by the way, about yesterday... when I opened the door?<eos> Oh, don't worry about it.<eos> It's fine.<eos> May I ask a question? Um...<eos> I-I noticed that sometimes you... you pin your hijab to the left and sometimes to the right.<eos> Is there a cultural significance I'm unaware of, or is it just the way you hold the pin when you clasp it?
- Shh!<eos> We're all clear down here.<eos> I'll secure the exits, see if I can get the monitors working again.<eos> Roger.<eos> You're not supposed to be down here.<eos> They heard you.<eos> You'd rather I let the other guy come down here?<eos> And what the hell are you doing with a drill?<eos> I left that open.<eos> Well, someone closed it.
You sure you don't want a cup?<eos> I'm fine. Thanks.<eos> Mr. Thomas tells me that you facilitated access to 38 others?<eos> Clients, yes.<eos> But based on our surveillance video,<eos> I've pretty much cleared 30 of them.<eos> Appreciate your crime-solving help but we'll decide who's in the clear.<eos> Hello?<eos> Now that hard drive, is it on its way?<eos> Uh, a soon as I get back to the office, I'll send it.
Oh yeah?<eos> You got a bathroom here?<eos> Go find it.<eos> What the hell you doing? What the hell are you doing?<eos> I played with The Who!<eos> The Who, man.<eos> I thought it was going to change my life.<eos> But it didn't.<eos> That envelope was mine!<eos> Pete Townsend gave it to me.
In the backseat of his car.<eos> My... my pants were pulled down, and he was...<eos> I couldn't move.<eos> I told him to stop, but he didn't, so I just... I focused on the air freshener swinging from the rearview mirror.<eos> It smelled like vanilla.<eos> After he was done, he turned on the radio...<eos> Opened the sunroof, called me babe, and he drove me home like nothing happened.<eos> Tao: In her original statement, Kelly said the assault occurred in a white four-door BMW, but she did not mention a sunroof.<eos> What if Mr. Box-of-bones was driving that car when he disappeared?<eos> Then he left it somewhere and never come back for it.
He came by your house?<eos> He didn't come by my house.<eos> Really? Well, your daughter seems to...<eos> My daughter is 7.<eos> She thinks she's a mermaid.<eos> She said that she met him, and Tate had your son's baseball glove. How do you explain that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know. [ Door opens ]<eos> The boy says his glove disappeared last summer.<eos> His father thought he lost it.
What is it?<eos> OK, Local Knowledge, you're coming with us.<eos> Bring the new human.<eos> No!<eos> Don't bring the new human.<eos> I'll just get distracted.<eos> If you want your extremities to stay attached, stand absolutely still.<eos> If not, we can provide a small bag, you can take them home at the end.<eos> Rigsy, your phone.<eos> It's like they've wiped it, but only the last day.
- 'She won't stop crying.'<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> Yeah, she can probably tell you're upset.<eos> Rump?<eos> It's Rump, isn't it?<eos> That man's wife.<eos> She said something.<eos> "Give it to me, tell me I can have it." What did she mean?<eos> Two ways to survive a Quantum Shade.<eos> The Shade's master removes the chronolock... .. or you can give it to someone else.
When Time Lords die, their minds are uploaded to a thing called the Matrix.<eos> This structure, it's like a living computer.<eos> It can predict the future, generate prophecies out of algorithms, ring the Cloister bells in the event of impending catastrophe.<eos> The Sliders -- they're just like the guard dogs, the firewall.<eos> Projections from inside the Matrix itself, the dead, manning the battlements.<eos> Was I supposed to understand any of that?<eos> The Time Lords have got a big computer made of ghosts, in a crypt, guarded by more ghosts.<eos> Didn't hurt, did it?<eos> Tiny bit.<eos> Why would a computer need to protect itself from the people who made it?
I'm the Doctor.<eos> You'd better be, you've got an operation to perform.<eos> Here's the entry wound, just below the hairline.<eos> And... .. there's the projectile.<eos> It should have killed him straight off, but he's very strong.<eos> - That's not a bullet.<eos> - It's a diamond.<eos> - How did it get in there?<eos> - At speed.<eos> Do you recognise it?
My grasp of the universal constants of physical reality has been changed... .. forever.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I've always wanted to see that done properly.<eos> Would you like a drink?<eos> Aldebaran brandy.<eos> Help yourself, but don't tell Dad.<eos> What's that noise?<eos> It seems to have powered down, conserving batteries.<eos> It's an in-built life-support system.<eos> - I'm not sure what powers it, but...
- Your actions will not go unpunished!<eos> Here.<eos> - Ow! - I don't suppose you mind if I freshen up.<eos> - Not bad for 200, eh?<eos> - 200?<eos> I have an augmented lifespan.<eos> Long story.<eos> - So, what's the occasion?<eos> - I've got the diamond, now it's time to sell it.<eos> I thought you were returning it to the Halassi?
Spoilers.<eos> Well, that would explain why you kept cancelling coming here.<eos> - Do you remember that time...<eos> - River, stop. - .. when there were two of you...<eos> - Don't. - .. because I want you to know that if this is the last night,<eos> Not everything can be avoided.<eos> Not forever.<eos> But you're you.<eos> There's always a loophole, you wait until the last minute<eos> - and then you spring it on me.
[laughing] Oh, my God.<eos> - Brian's coming?<eos> - T?<eos> Turns out he's the best man, Jenna.<eos> This is so uncomfortable for me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Take it down a notch.<eos> So you let Brian station his soldier in your camp, and then you both shipped off.<eos> The feeling was mutual.<eos> You said it yourself, so what's the ish?
New research suggests that our brains trick us into misremembering the truth.<eos> We can't possibly remember every single thing that happens to us, but we trust the memories we do retain.<eos> We remember every detail about the birth of a child.<eos> We know where we had a special meal and whom we were with.<eos> But what if some of those memories aren't real?<eos> What if we invented them?<eos> Or... Someone else implanted them?<eos> This is Susumu Tonegawa's favorite spot to enjoy a cup of coffee.<eos> And sitting here also reminds the M.I.T. scientist of the time two cars slammed into each other just a few feet away.<eos> He mentions the accident to his friend, but his friend remembers it differently.
You are going anywhen with me because I am taking you back in time.<eos> Step through this archway and enter Christmas Eve, 1995.<eos> I'd really rather not.<eos> Bill Clinton was in the White House.<eos> On the radio, Hootie was blowing fish.<eos> And in this house, our little Natey was six.<eos> This is the Christmas that Santa gave Nate his first bike.<eos> And tomorrow, he will break his first bone.<eos> Really, where did you find that?<eos> I found it in the back of the garage.
I don't think it's that expensive.<eos> It's actually quite reasonable.<eos> Yeah, if you're David Hasselhoff.<eos> He's probably loaded.<eos> "Baywatch" ran for a really long time.<eos> Of course it did.<eos> It was a great show.<eos> Jimmy, I don't want you to worry about money.<eos> I'm not expecting you to buy this place with me.<eos> You can just chip in when you want whenever you can afford it.
Oh. He was emancipated from his dad.<eos> He claimed sexual abuse.<eos> It was never proven.<eos> Sir, how did you know that?<eos> Because 40,000 wouldn't get Taylor a down payment in this neighborhood, but it is a competitive rate for a hit man.<eos> Hold up. Are you saying our Brian Taylor's not so normal because he hired a hit man?<eos> I think all of our victims did.<eos> We need to deliver the profile.<eos> Right.<eos> Sir, uh, to who are we gonna deliver it to?
Can't give them his name 'cause of the whole shot in the mouth thing.<eos> But his fingerprints lit up the Rome police database like a Christmas tree.<eos> Italian.<eos> That explains the pulcinella influence.<eos> Yeah. They were able to get a name-<eos> - Giuseppe Montolo, but by the time Jersey P.D. got there,<eos> Montolo had been patched up and made his escape.<eos> And now he's on some type of payback gig.<eos> He has no idea who double-crossed him, so now he's killing every customer that he suspects might have done it.<eos> I tried to use Al's username and password to flush out other clients, but they don't call it the Darknet for nothing.
Yeah. As you can imagine, the soil there is quite fertile.<eos> No, no thank you. Ew.<eos> Yeah, just keep dumping loads...<eos> Okay. It's enough.<eos> No. No, thank you.<eos> I-I can't do this. I cannot!<eos> Do you have to sit this close to me? !<eos> I'm like Beetlejuice.<eos> Say my name three times, and I just show up.<eos> No one even said it once, Andre!
I got to stay competitive.<eos> I mean, who isn't a competitor?<eos> Wall Street, big oil, little oil.<eos> Little oil?<eos> It's a guy I know.<eos> He siphons gasoline out of parted cars and sells it on the side of the road.<eos> Does he have a drone?<eos> Well, right now, he has a screwdriver, a hose and a bucket, but a drone cannot be far behind.<eos> The guy's an innovator.<eos> The best part of this whole thing-- when EBDB Prime members aren't using it, I get to use it, and it helps with tedious tasks that I never want to do.
Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...<eos> A team centered around people with powers?<eos> There exists a small percentage of the population with a dormant alien gene.<eos> There's a chemical compound that activates this gene.<eos> And you, Joey, are one of the first people to come into contact with it.
So I think in your drunken stumble through history, you've probably investigated every story involving one.<eos> And I've seen you eyeing all of your exits, my knee brace, wondering if you can get away with it.<eos> The only reason you came with us was to confirm its existence.<eos> - And destroy it.<eos> - You'll have to go through me.<eos> And I could.<eos> Literally.<eos> But, then, I don't know what Amazon woman and Robot hand are capable of these days, so I will help you get her back.<eos> I'm not entirely heartless. But if I do,<eos> I want your word that we will demolish this portal and no one passes through it again.
- What do you want?<eos> - Your skills.<eos> I plan to put Ward six feet underground at the least.<eos> Your help would be appreciated.<eos> I'm out.<eos> My father needs me.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Car accident.<eos> Broke his hip.<eos> Police called it a hit-and-run.
You win.<eos> Nobody treats me like that and lives.<eos> Do you even know who the hell I am?<eos> Do you?<eos> !<eos> You're Werner von Strucker.<eos> Your father was Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, one of HYDRA's greatest leaders.<eos> Powerful family name doesn't mean you deserve respect.<eos> You earn that.<eos> I wondered if you had it in you.
I hope your weird Brujo uncle can help us out.<eos> I'll look inside of you.<eos> You want me to take an acid trip?<eos> Oh, no, you...<eos> Uh, everything all right in there?<eos> Who's fuckin' with who now, huh?<eos> !<eos> And then he started speaking in tongues, and-and it looked like he was having a seizure and then, that's when he grabbed me by the throat, and started to strangle me.<eos> And the name of this demon, are you sure it was "Eligos?"<eos> I'm positive, because he said it just like that.
Still, I might've given my life for her.<eos> God, we would've made such a handsome couple.<eos> So, how did that happen?<eos> My asshole hand.<eos> It came back, grew another me.<eos> Same shit, different day.<eos> Things were goin' fine with Amanda too, but that went south.<eos> All because of that goddamn book.<eos> No disrespect.<eos> You were the one who read from it.
Hey, Hulkies.<eos> So, as you know, I was all set to bail on my web show, the one I started, like, 50 adventures ago to show the Hulk as a hero.<eos> Why?<eos> Becase I proved, without a doubt, that the Hulk is a hero.<eos> But all I ever got for it was seven lousy thumbs-ups.
Sing, Sing, Sing.<eos> Wonderful beat.<eos> A despicable species, the humans, but they do have rhythm.<eos> General, sir.<eos> Sir, I have an update on Defiance.<eos> Datak and Stahma have destroyed the Arch.<eos> Ha!<eos> Excellent!<eos> And the hologram?<eos> The entire town saw it.
My way is effective and safe.<eos> Rest assured, love, I will think only of you.<eos> _<eos> Looks like it's been recently plowed.<eos> According to this, underground access is in that barn.<eos> Ah, that barn smell.<eos> Heh.<eos> You mean manure?<eos> What ever happened to romance?<eos> I killed it and ate it.
Try to get a nine-year-old boy!<eos> We'll do play dates with Will!<eos> Oh, look at us... you realize they're gonna have to wheel us into the PTA meetings, right?<eos> Oh, god.<eos> I hope so.<eos> Oh, hey!<eos> Okay...<eos> So, you know that red top that you have?<eos> It's like, kind of lacey?<eos> - You wore it to the Drake concert?
That's awesome!<eos> Weeks, honey!<eos> "That's crazy!"<eos> Those ribs look killer.<eos> Best griller in KC, right?<eos> Watch the sauce.<eos> You don't want to burn those bad boys.<eos> You know, Larry, I think I've had enough of your advice to last me a lifetime, thank you very much.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Well maybe if you took it for once...
I'm Manny Goldman, the park supervisor.<eos> What's with all the ruckus?<eos> It's these nosy kids again.<eos> Fortunately, I used to work for a government defense company... so I know how to take down intruders.<eos> Like, she's not kidding.<eos> Sorry, everyone.<eos> We're just trying to help.<eos> We overheard that the park is in trouble.<eos> And seeing how we're such big KISS fans, we'd like to do all that we can.<eos> We've got it under control, missy.
I got one of the both of you.<eos> In vibrant, colorful acrylic.<eos> - You just painted our portrait?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Just now?<eos> - No big deal.<eos> Just something I do in my spare time.<eos> Oops.<eos> Well, look, my thumb got in the way.<eos> But you painted it.
Half of them broke off.<eos> They're going toward Alexandria.<eos> Towards you?<eos> We ran ahead.<eos> There's a horn or something.<eos> Loud, coming from the east.<eos> It's not stopping.<eos> I'm gonna gas it up, turn back.<eos> Rick:<eos> We have it.
- Am I driving?<eos> - Mm, fuck no, you're not driving.<eos> It's not that far.<eos> Please and thank you.<eos> Bye, Keith.<eos> Bye.<eos> You do look, uh...<eos> you do look good in that dress.<eos> I know.<eos> That's why I wore it.
We had some good times.<eos> We had good times.<eos> They weren't all bad times.<eos> Not all bad times.<eos> Nobody makes me laugh like you. Ah. You know that thing you used to do with your finger?<eos> Hmm? Nobody could do that like you.<eos> There are other people.<eos> No.<eos> You have a talent.<eos> What did we used to call it?
Go.<eos> Hello?<eos> Erin. Hey. It's... it's Gunnar.<eos> How did you get my number?<eos> Actually, it's, uh, kind of a funny story.<eos> I called Juliette's tour manager and asked him for it, but he wouldn't give it to me 'cause of some confidentiality policy.<eos> Anyway, so I told him I was looking for a sound tech.<eos> You know, 'cause Juliette had you fired.<eos> Quick thinking, right?<eos> Anyway, uh, he finally gave it to me, and, uh, now here we are.
Thanks.<eos> You all right?<eos> Honestly, no.<eos> I got a pile of bills here, and I'm just not making enough to cover them.<eos> You know, I, uh... I have access to Juliette's accounts.<eos> If you really need something, I can...<eos> I'm not taking her money.<eos> - But it's for Cadence...<eos> - No. Not a dime.<eos> Then I'll loan it to you.

I refuse to go to bed on week-old sheets.<eos> And I refuse to go to bed angry.<eos> Good policy... on both counts.<eos> For the record, in my profile, I listed plenty of your strengths.<eos> You weren't wrong about my weaknesses, either, Shelby.<eos> You're right... I-I do try and control everything.<eos> I just figure that if I know what's happening, I won't be blindsided.<eos> Like that file in your bag.<eos> My father was an FBI agent.<eos> I always wanted to know so much about him, but now that I have it, I...
Just tell them.<eos> You know, Simon and Vasquez aren't the only ones in here with a secret.<eos> I'm not a trainee.<eos> I'm a special agent who was assigned to Quantico to work undercover.<eos> And I can tell you that Vasquez and Simon deserve to be here because of their secrets, because of their rage.<eos> Vasquez, what you've done for your daughter...<eos> It's that fight that is gonna drive you to be a great agent.<eos> And, Simon, when you threw me against a wall,<eos> I mean, we were eye to eye, and I saw the soldier inside of you,<eos> I saw that pain, and I get it.
Yeah, that's Fletcher.<eos> Yep.<eos> What the hell is he doing?<eos> What?<eos> Looks like Brandon left us a parting gift.<eos> Is it real?<eos> It looks real.<eos> Yes, it's real.<eos> Of course it's real.<eos> We just watched J. Crew put it in there!
What?<eos> Looks like Brandon left us a parting gift.<eos> Is it real?<eos> It looks real.<eos> Yes, it's real.<eos> Of course it's real.<eos> We just watched J. Crew put it in there!<eos> Come on.<eos> It can't be real.<eos> He had to have been told to put it there.
Well, trying to save yours was incidental.<eos> Listen, I know you're angry.<eos> But do you have any idea how painful it is to have to hide yourself from the world?<eos> All this time, you've only thought about how it's affected you.<eos> It's been hard on us, too.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> No, you're not fine.<eos> You're angry.<eos> I threw away a seven-figure, partner-track job for some ridiculous notion that I was meant to serve truth, justice, and all that Superman crap.<eos> And then I abandoned it with seconds left to spare.
But while he's watching that movie, I'm seeing reality, which is that tomorrow, you're gonna go back to Quantico for three more months, and he'll be undercover with me for up to a year...<eos> Still talking all about you.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> I don't know what to say...<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Please, please.<eos> This isn't about apologies or excuses or, like, the things we say to one another when we think we're being called out for something we didn't do.<eos> Because... you did do it.<eos> You broke his heart.<eos> And I know how awful that is, because I broke it first.
And we all think it points to a biological attack on a D.C. park.<eos> Why a park?<eos> Low security, high foot traffic.<eos> You maximize casualties.<eos> Congratulations on a successful briefing.<eos> You made your case.<eos> Yes, well done.<eos> But there is one thing you don't know.<eos> This is based on a real-life scenario.<eos> We stopped it.
What's wrong?<eos> What if Grand Central was the dry run?<eos> There's another bomb out there.<eos> Explain to me exactly what I'm looking at.<eos> Okay.<eos> I found that wire in the apartment next to mine, where the bomb was really built.<eos> What's so special about it?<eos> Simon told me it's a lead wire, and... and according to all the preliminary forensics, the only wiring that was used in the bomb was blasting wire.<eos> So the bomber used the lead wire in the second device.<eos> Well, they used it for something.
- Oh!<eos> Come on, Alex.<eos> You know there's always a twist.<eos> While he was the suspect... you were the terrorist.<eos> But I've had that bag on me since the moment we left Quantico.<eos> Yeah, well, while you were running around the park looking for a suspect you thought you knew, one you didn't slipped it into your bag.<eos> He was the decoy meant to lead you to FBI headquarters, knowing he'd need you to get in.<eos> And I was so focused on following him I didn't realize I was a part of his plan.<eos> Bigger picture... it's not always something you can see.<eos> And today none of you saw it.
Okay, can we not do this right now?<eos> I'm just saying.<eos> I'm gonna go get something to eat.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Mmm. How was work?<eos> It was fine.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Having dinner.<eos> I cut your hair crooked.<eos> Do you want me to fix it?
Easy for you to say, Brooke Burke!<eos> If I had a birthing canal that straight, basically, having a baby is like taking a big fart.<eos> All right, yeah, sure, that movie was beautiful and well-made, but at the end of the day, what are you gonna remember more:<eos> A great movie, or a good ol' Frisbee made in the U.S. of...<eos> - Chernobyl?<eos> - Okay, just...<eos> Y'all mad.<eos> That video was hella compelling.<eos> And everyone knows Brooke Burke doesn't get out of bed for less than $10,000.<eos> Okay, it wasn't compelling and everyone hated it.
Of what, a little pain?<eos> No, that's not Mindy.<eos> I mean, just last week, she spent the whole day with a dart in her shoulder.<eos> Danny, whenever Mindy gets scared of doing something hard, she always tries to pretend like it's not happening.<eos> Like that time she stole all that Oxy because she was afraid to get a Brazilian.<eos> She's scared, Danny.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, she hasn't been to the dentist in, like, 10 years.<eos> The other day we were kissing and a tooth came right out.<eos> I swallowed it.
Okay, okay, we will.<eos> We can go out tomorrow night.<eos> Yes, awesome!<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> It just feels like my head's gonna explode.<eos> But that could be the Stacey.<eos> Hi.<eos> Welcome to the Mercer Street Club. Can I help you?<eos> Hello, I was hoping to hang my open house flyer in your exclusive members-only club.<eos> You know, so that a rich-o might see it.
Don't you want him to have family around?<eos> All the time, always?<eos> I don't know.<eos> My family's been here for two days, and you've threatened to throw yourself out of the window 14 times.<eos> Yeah, because it took some getting used to, but I...<eos> I need it.<eos> I love it.<eos> Oh, you love seeing my dad's penis?<eos> You know what, I do.<eos> I didn't have that growing up, and I'd like Leo to have it, because, you know what?
- It's not worth it.<eos> I'll just go on welfare.<eos> It's easier.<eos> now hold on.<eos> and don't ever let anyone try to stop you from doing what you want.<eos> Not even me.<eos> Danny.<eos> - You know what we should do?<eos> You see this stupid armoire?<eos> - Yes. take it as a sign from the universe...
It's odd, isn't it?<eos> Second-class stamp.<eos> "We want what you have." An estate agent, I think.<eos> I buy new, everything top spec.<eos> You know me, Mrs Yount, my personal guarantee. £12,000.<eos> I could probably throw in the wiring and the down lighters for that.<eos> And we do half cash, half through the books.<eos> It's not that I don't like the wet room you've installed.<eos> It's just that...<eos> Well, we never use it.
I think you're right.<eos> Would you ever... consider getting a little work done, you know, when the time comes?<eos> Nah.<eos> No need.<eos> Black don't crack.<eos> Oh. Why is that?<eos> Superior genetics, baby.<eos> I mean, that and a clean lifestyle.<eos> Yeah. I treat my body like a precision race car.<eos> Keep it shiny and new forever.
You could trigger the virus.<eos> You have to connect the gem to the Joker's suit.<eos> The feedback should shut everything down.<eos> - Where do I attach this thing?<eos> - You need to find the central core.<eos> But attach it to the wrong place, and it's Jokerworld forever.<eos> Great.<eos> No pressure.<eos> Joker's suit is stolen military tech built by Wayne Industries.<eos> The AI must have found it when it hacked Gotham.
God, are you crazy?<eos> It will have no effect!<eos> It'll take down their network for weeks.<eos> They'll recover.<eos> It would still hurt them.<eos> We don't want to hurt them!<eos> We want to kill them!<eos> And neither will happen if we do nothing right now.<eos> What are you doing, huh?<eos> Take another step, and I'll do it.
I took it all.<eos> I own your whole world.<eos> I need your word.<eos> When this goes down, Shayla and I go free.<eos> You leave us alone.<eos> Forever.<eos> If anyone tries to hurt us, if I even see one of your guys following me, I leak everything.<eos> - You're saying this knowing...<eos> - You can kill me anytime, yes.<eos> That's why I coded the leak to auto-send every 24 hours unless I continuously disable it.
But you have to admit, she's just like everyone else.<eos> Too afraid to peek over their walls for fear of what they might see.<eos> Not me.<eos> That's what I do.<eos> I look.<eos> Did you get everybody back?<eos> Tell him to follow the proper commands, or the sequence won't initiate.<eos> Using the backdoor we planted with our raspberry pie.<eos> Jesus Christ, man, how long have you been sitting on all this?<eos> I installed a patch four weeks ago, and I've been monitoring it daily.
I'm serious, Elliot.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I'm calling myself from your phone.<eos> That way we have each other's number.<eos> - Wait, Darlene, we don't do that.<eos> - That's to protect Fsociety.<eos> Okay, but we need to protect each other right now.<eos> Lose Darlene's number.<eos> It's a rule for a reason.<eos> Don't worry, I'm not gonna use it.
Defending those that bleed the innocent.<eos> - Serving them, slave to master.<eos> - It's ignoring the remote.<eos> They hacked our smart TV.<eos> Congratulations, Mr. Goddard.<eos> - It's posted to our website.<eos> - And YouTube.<eos> You will soon be finished.<eos> In 90 seconds this code will change.<eos> If I don't log in with it on my computer before then, I'll lose everything to time.
- Forget it. I don't wanna hear it.<eos> Every member in this company stood in there, watching the single worst thing that's happened to Allsafe, and where are you, at your cubicle?<eos> Doing what?<eos> Uh, Gideon, I hate to interrupt...<eos> - No, not now, Ollie.<eos> - But Evil Corp's on the phone.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> We're not finished here.<eos> I know.<eos> You thought I didn't put the code in time, but I had to hide it quickly before Gideon saw it.
- Quinn?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I'm pregnant.<eos> - Well, is it mine?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You said you were into somebody else.<eos> I was faithful to you.<eos> You don't think every single person in this country doesn't write off an extra thing here or there?<eos> Do you really want our kids to hear you say that?<eos> That cheating is okay 'cause everyone else does it?
Isn't the women's movement all about choice?<eos> Bottom line... if girls are dumb enough to wear shirts like that, that's not my problem.<eos> I'm just making a buck off their stupidity.<eos> Right now, I couldn't be prouder.<eos> Wait, did you just record that?<eos> Yep.<eos> Sure did.<eos> Vine is gonna love this one.<eos> Okay, just go with the momentum of the bull.<eos> Don't try and fight it.
Sorry, I just... it's Adriana.<eos> Ana showed up to the reception. She's okay.<eos> But do you think we're gonna get any of the money back?<eos> I mean, they took the car.<eos> Super bold piece, man.<eos> I'm so glad everyone loved your idea.<eos> Look, man.<eos> Sure...<eos> I was inspired by what you played, but prepared piano has been around forever.<eos> It's not like you invented it.
You're the guy I call.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I know what's going on.<eos> And I'm going to fix it.<eos> You know?<eos> Wait, what are you saying?<eos> Remember that Gould fund that lost money last year?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where do you think all that money went?<eos> I lost it in an offshore account.
Mr. Wheeler, cocaine from the cocaine plant.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> I'd love to try that.<eos> I'll take two.<eos> Thank you, thank you.<eos> - From the finest stash.<eos> - I'll have a couple. Thanks.<eos> There we go.<eos> This service is excellent.<eos> That's how we do it.
Let me see.<eos> Not so bad.<eos> I am gonna lean on Garo for a fucking bonus for that performance, that's how beautiful it was.<eos> Didn't I tell you this was gonna be good?<eos> Huh? You have put yourself in a hell of a fucking position.<eos> You didn't have to call out Ryan, but we're gonna let that slide.<eos> So you're gonna let that fight happen, then?<eos> I am gonna let that fight happen.<eos> You did your job.<eos> You earned it.
He has hit the wall trying to decipher the rest of the map.<eos> There are four bonds missing.<eos> Do you know where they are?<eos> Come on, let's stop fucking around, Carlitos.<eos> Let's take our natural places on this stage.<eos> Me, the businessman. You, the impresario.<eos> Oh, we can make a deal that's beneficial for both of us.<eos> I give you the map. What do I get in return?<eos> The Twister?<eos> Run it however you wish.
Find me the low life that wrote this.<eos> Give me a few hours.<eos> I'm so sorry about that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh...<eos> I think the reserve price on the Napoleon bicorne is pretty aggressive, so an offer of $2.3 million is more than fair.<eos> But as I told you, The Camilleri Museum does not see itself as the owner of a 19th century bicorne.<eos> It sees itself as the conservator of a historic artifact.<eos> We are parting with it only because we are in need of operating funds.<eos> We need the next conservator to be one who treats it with the respect and reverence it is due.
Yeah, that's why I'm here.<eos> Does DeGraaf's have some kind of beef with you?<eos> Why would they?<eos> They're kissing my ass.<eos> They want my account just the same as you.<eos> They're the source of that blog post.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> A former employee who still has friends over there.<eos> And the same blogger posted it today.
I'm dating Ashley now.<eos> Well, that was super fast.<eos> But, um, don't worry about me.<eos> I will not interfere with your love life.<eos> In fact, unless you need me, you won't even notice I'm around, okay?<eos> Okay. Were you able to get a new place?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> The location is awesome.<eos> I'll see you around, neighbor.<eos> She rented it to Riley?
Oh, no, not the frame, the photo.<eos> This... This necklace?<eos> Bryony Willet's been seen at Sean's a few times but he's gone, he's cleared all his... stuff out.<eos> What...?<eos> Maya.<eos> Aged 46.<eos> Adult meningitis.<eos> The necklace had been in her family for generations.<eos> We were unable to have any...<eos> We were unable to have any children to pass it on to so I gave it to Talika, something special to wear for her exhibition.
So, where's the necklace now?<eos> I know what people think of me.<eos> And for your information I liked her.<eos> I liked seeing her wear the necklace but I would never have done her any harm.<eos> Jasper, we know Talika was wearing the necklace when she came home.<eos> What happened to it?<eos> I saw it on the floor when we first found her.<eos> I couldn't just leave it there, broken.<eos> And I... I didn't want to have to explain myself to get it back.<eos> So, you took it?
Processing trauma?<eos> The art was keeping her stable.<eos> You were the one that checked the tapes, you promised me the footage was all destroyed.<eos> I thought it was.<eos> So, then Indrek's body's discovered and your son comes home saying he's just seen himself on Talika's exhibition.<eos> She'd crossed the line, hadn't she?<eos> I had no idea that she'd worked on the experiment.<eos> I mean, I hadn't met her before but then she had this video.<eos> She was showing the world.<eos> What happened after you saw it?
I had scoliosis as a kid.<eos> I had a small surgery to correct it.<eos> I was flat on my back for a few weeks, so to help combat the boredom, every night, my father would wheel my bed out and talk about the stars.<eos> Nice job, dad.<eos> So, this portal...<eos> How do we know it's not just a door that swings one way?<eos> I think it acts more like a valve.<eos> On earth, it seemed to open randomly,<eos> But it only appeared random from our point of view.<eos> What opens it?
- What's going on?<eos> - They're taking Mama away. - Papa?<eos> - Mama's going to hospital. - So she can get better.<eos> - We didn't say goodbye.<eos> No need to worry.<eos> You'll see her again soon.<eos> Mama! Mama!<eos> She didn't open the present.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You can give it to her when she comes back.
The National Socialist Movement is standing firm against these treasonable elements and purging society of an epidemic that threatens the purity of our great German culture.<eos> No nation is immune to these...<eos> Go to your room, please, darling.<eos> Do you think our money is safe?<eos> - How do you mean? - In the bank.<eos> Everything's feeling uncertain.<eos> Better than under the mattress.<eos> - Georg...<eos> - Of course it is.<eos> I moved it back from London.
Extract!<eos> Lock it down.<eos> Secure the perimeter.<eos> How long have you know about the problem?<eos> Let's just say that two weeks ago this room... didn't exist.<eos> Many of the things you said to the working group corroborate my team's discovery.<eos> The ocular change, for example.<eos> You call it the...<eos> - Defiant Pupil.<eos> - We call it the Delta Determinate.
Are we planning some renovations?<eos> A long-term stratagem.<eos> Nothing pressing. Huh.<eos> Well, just so you know, I expected the asset tracking report to be ready today, but it's not.<eos> It's...<eos> Some kind of delay, but I will get to the bottom of it first thing tomorrow.<eos> - I have it.<eos> - You have it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I asked them to deliver it directly to me.
Just my blog.<eos> It's gonna change everything.<eos> The only thing that ever changes around here are the fancy pants administrators. Ah.<eos> Maybe not those pants.<eos> What?<eos> Hank... would you please tell Margaret how great my blog is?<eos> Oh, my God, it's so great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sounds so awesome.<eos> You haven't even seen it, have you?
40. Hmm.<eos> You know what, you might want a second opinion.<eos> So let me just step on in there.<eos> - Take over.<eos> - Thanks so much, Doctor.<eos> It's good to see you again, Pam.<eos> I was so happy to hear that you were re-elected.<eos> I know that all my patients voted for you.<eos> Well, thank you for your support.<eos> You always have it.
This way.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> You can leave us.<eos> I can't accept this.<eos> But it is my thanks for your advice.<eos> I called my father and stood up for myself.<eos> Finally.<eos> I'm glad to hear that.<eos> And while I will accept your thanks, I must return this extravagant gift.<eos> I insist you keep it.
Enjoy."<eos> And he was like, "Why am I looking at a sperm document?"<eos> - Oh, babe.<eos> - Like, I...<eos> And then I was like, "Oh, my God,"<eos> and started hitting keys, sorta like smashing it, like that was gonna fix this.<eos> And then I completely went crazy.<eos> - I'm sorry, it's not funny.<eos> - It was funny.<eos> And then I grabbed it, like I turned into
Come here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look, I bet your mom would have been very proud of you today.<eos> I would have given you an A-plus.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> It's been hard to admit that my mom wasn't perfect.<eos> Maybe that's why it's hard talking about her with Evan.<eos> See, to him, she was perfect, and I want to protect that memory for him.<eos> But I've been protecting it for myself too, and maybe I don't need to anymore.
You hung up on him, huh?<eos> No, he wasn't there.<eos> It was just a message.<eos> You left that on his voice-mail?<eos> Did I sound crazy?<eos> No, no, not at all.<eos> Except for maybe the part where you threatened to kidnap his child.<eos> And I have this amazing new job.<eos> Well, it's temporary.<eos> But Boris asked me to do it, so...
You see somebody yawning, you can't help but yawn yourself.<eos> Same thing with laughter.<eos> And you think that's what's happening with the animals?<eos> I can't say for sure, but it's a theory.<eos> But if it's true, that would explain why the abnormal animal behaviors have been increasing so much these past few weeks.<eos> Because animals in proximity could be triggering each other.<eos> Like inside the truck.<eos> You're saying one of the animals starts displaying the behavior, then it spreads from one to the next.<eos> Like a spark.<eos> Something my father said, I didn't understand at the time, but... he called it "the spark."
Sorry.<eos> Yes?<eos> Stuart, is that you?<eos> Well, who the bloody hell do you think it is?<eos> I hadn't heard your constant mewling for so long, I'd forgotten what it sounded like.<eos> What do you want, Freddie?<eos> I'm just calling to find out where we keep the tea.<eos> It's impossible to know where you hide everything.<eos> In the cupboard by the sink!<eos> I looked, I couldn't find it.
I don't know what to do.<eos> It seems to me the answer is right in front of you.<eos> You're right. I'm going to ask her!<eos> Just excuse me for a moment.<eos> Hey, Balthazar. What are you doing there, eh, matey?<eos> Oh, you're a dirty dog!<eos> Dirty, dirty dog!<eos> There's something I want to give you, Ash.<eos> It's my mother's wedding ring.<eos> I want you to have it.
We're buds, he teaches me ASL three times a week, I know how to talk to him.<eos> A strip club?<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> It's a gentlemen's club.<eos> Call it what you want, it's still degrading.<eos> I talked to the guy.<eos> One of his investors cashed out and retired.<eos> Now he needs a new silent partner.<eos> Our names will be nowhere near the business.<eos> I had Marty check it out.
Says the best-selling author of erotica.<eos> Wait... My erotica is not pornography.<eos> It's tasteful and literary.<eos> - There is a spectrum.<eos> - Just like with these clubs.<eos> You're thinking about all those seedy joints out by the airport.<eos> Oh, and this place is the Taj Mahal?<eos> It's suit and tie, they have a great wine list...<eos> You know what?<eos> Why don't we go check it out together?
So...<eos> Lily will pick a card.<eos> And then whoever wrote it can read it out loud<eos> - to the rest of the group.<eos> - Bay, if you don't mind?<eos> Hi, everyone.<eos> I'm so sorry for being late.<eos> I just wanted to thank you all for coming out today to support Lily and Toby.<eos> And a special thank you to Bay for pinch-hitting as hostess.<eos> I didn't have time to write out my advice, so I'll just share it quickly. Um...
~ Want to try it? ~ No.<eos> What's your seat upholstery made from?<eos> Wet suits. What?<eos> Old wet suits.<eos> If, for example, you drove in, you know, your car went into some water...<eos> Which does happen.<eos> Yeah, it does happen. The seats aren't ruined.<eos> There's one feature I want to show you on my car, if I may.<eos> Obviously I've built a sport fishing boat.<eos> Um, but I've equipped it with some excellent wheels.
You know we're not going to be IN the cars?<eos> I knew that. Good.<eos> This is a test of the car's robustness and safety.<eos> ~ Can I just say...<eos> ~ That's good. I thought it was death.<eos> .. I really like my car and I don't want to do that to it.<eos> Well, no, this is the thing.<eos> Working on this programme is a bit like doing a jigsaw.<eos> You spend ages and ages and ages doing something, you go,<eos> "Yes, that's brilliant, now I'm going to smash it up and put it in a box."
Look at me.<eos> I'm a real live politician.<eos> You didn't like it.<eos> Oh. Turkey meatballs were dry. I should have cracked an egg.<eos> I knew I should have cracked an egg.<eos> I said to myself, "Shelly... " But you know what?<eos> I didn't want to spend the money. Is something wrong?<eos> You want your coffee?<eos> - What?<eos> - You want me to warm it up?
Say "Operation:<eos> Bestow Glory" actually works.<eos> What are you gonna do while I consult with the police?<eos> You know I have my distractions.<eos> You really don't get it.<eos> I don't get what?<eos> When it comes to what we do, the only thing that matters to me is our partnership, so you go, I go.<eos> You offered me a job.<eos> I didn't take it to work with the police.<eos> I took it to work with you.
You know how much they charge for that?<eos> Ten thousand American dollars.<eos> Here's the thing. Last time I went, there was a guy sitting next to me.<eos> He saw me walking up to mine, and you know what he said to me?<eos> He says, "'Scuse me, son."<eos> Top off my Perrier and get some of that "bread for my wife?"<eos> That piece of shit took me for his busboy.<eos> So your pissed that he didn't know you were just another rich asshole that drinks expensive wine.<eos> I don't just drink it.<eos> I was there when they bottled it.
Let him go.<eos> He's right.<eos> Carlos is coming and we can't let him win.<eos> Who put you in charge?<eos> You ever been buried alive?<eos> Trust me, it's not the lack of air that gets you. It's the crazy that sets in.<eos> Imagine the blood of a thousand souls buried at once.<eos> That's what Carlos has.<eos> Opium for the people.<eos> He's selling it like it's religion. Y'all have seen it.
Really?<eos> Any takers?<eos> Assholes.<eos> Fine.<eos> You wanna follow this lunatic, be my guest. But know this: What he's gonna do with this blood is pedestrian compared to what I would have done with it.<eos> I'll see you assholes in Xibalba.<eos> _<eos> So what's your brilliant idea?<eos> How do we stop him?<eos> Get the truck. Ram the tanker, blow it to hell.
So what's your brilliant idea?<eos> How do we stop him?<eos> Get the truck. Ram the tanker, blow it to hell.<eos> I thought about that, but my peeps need that blood.<eos> Even it is in small doses. We blow anything to hell, it's gotta be Carlos.<eos> - I can talk to him.<eos> - Like he's gonna listen to you.<eos> I made him.<eos> He'll listen.<eos> - I still say we blow it up. - No.
- Afterlife?<eos> - I'll explain later.<eos> And yet that thimg keeps finding us, killed most of my friends.<eos> Lincoln gave me names.<eos> I checked them against the bodies we could identify.<eos> That's how I knew Lash was using Jiaying's ledger to find us.<eos> - Her ledger?<eos> - She kept a genealogy of Inhumans.<eos> She was the only one allowed to use it, until...<eos> Until S.H.I.E.L.D. recovered it.
I'm not very good with faces sometimes. - I apologize.<eos> - You should, yeah.<eos> Oh, I'm terribly sorry.<eos> I don't remember.<eos> You sure you don't remember me?<eos> Can you just take a minute to think this through?<eos> Does it look like a minute would make a difference?<eos> Does it seem as if I've made a rash decision here?<eos> Look, if I just knew your name, I could apologize to you.<eos> You never remembered it anyway!
Don't.<eos> - Brad, where are you taking me?<eos> - Shh! Thanks for calling back.<eos> 3:00 P.M. is perfect.<eos> You know the address, so I'll see you then.<eos> Remember when we used to talk structure?<eos> Back when we were gonna be the Powell brothers?<eos> Now, I'm still a terrible driver, so better buckle up.<eos> We always said the perfect ending had to be both surprising and inevitable.<eos> I want you to be both shocked by the horror but anticipating it, too.
We should spend some time together.<eos> I don't want to make you late for the dojo.<eos> How about dinner?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Was that the phone before?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was the wrong number.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> Embarrassing, right?<eos> Hey, don't knock it.
Uh, red with white letters.<eos> "Earth is our only planet."<eos> David: Instead of taking my wife's D.N.A., shouldn't you be finding these two bikers from my sister's trial?<eos> We've been rolling up the Fifth Dynasty all night, Mr. Farrell, serving warrants, impounding motorcycles.<eos> We have all of L.A.P.D. patrol on the lookout, sheriff's deputies, FBI agents.<eos> We have an entire floor that is overflowing with Fifth Dynasty gang members.<eos> Eventually, we will find someone who understands it's to their advantage to help us.<eos> What more could they be doing?<eos> I'll tell you what more they could be doing.<eos> They could be tracing Henry's cell phone, except that you took it away from him.
Big deal.<eos> Let me see this.<eos> This isn't because of my hep C, is it?<eos> [beeping] __<eos> (Boris) Don't touch that.<eos> This certainly... complicates things.<eos> Mr. Lawson.<eos> For many weeks now, it's been imperative that this operating theater and the surgical procedure for which it was built be kept secret.<eos> Well... your secret's safe with me.<eos> 'Cause I don't know it.
I do know...<eos> This is where I belong, in a lab, not out there with people.<eos> And your refusal to see that and HankMed's attempt to... [voice quakes] [clears throat] to turn me into something that I am not, they are distractions... foolish, dangerous distractions.<eos> Mmm.<eos> [giggles]<eos> Blackberry promotes a pleasant sleepiness.<eos> And here I thought that was Ken's conversation.<eos> Hilarious.<eos> But don't knock the incense.<eos> Helen uses it for her patients, depending on their aura that day.
Hope he asks us a question we know answer to.<eos> Good morning.<eos> What's the name of the monument you passed during the flight?<eos> Cristo el Redentor.<eos> -That's correct.<eos> -Yes!<eos> -Your prize.<eos> -Thank you! Detour:<eos> Sand or Sidewalk.<eos> Soccer is Brazil's number one sport, and it's so popular here they play it on volleyball courts.
That's my favorite episode.<eos> I mean, darlene was set up perfectly --<eos> Every word she said.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did you see that?<eos> What was that?<eos> Did you just hack the atcu?<eos> No, but the containment module<eos> Broadcasts some pretty intense encrypted homing signals.<eos> You put it inside a corporate office,
How can I stand to look at him?<eos> It's not natural, what he is.<eos> It goes against God.<eos> But what if God made him this way?<eos> Anna, it's an abomination, OK?<eos> The Bible says it.<eos> I wish I'd never told you.<eos> So do I.<eos> I hope you know how much your support means to me.<eos> You'll always have it, Father.
What I need is to look beyond my own backyard.<eos> You see, Ash Park benefits if the rest of the community benefits.<eos> And so I've decided to run for pre-selection as a candidate for the Country Party, and my guest here, Sir Richard, is considering throwing his support my way.<eos> Now, there will be ramifications for all of us.<eos> But if I win, I can make a real difference in Inverness. I believe I can.<eos> Amen.<eos> L'chaim.<eos> To life.<eos> Many men have come to me, looking for my backing.<eos> And I have to say, I rarely give it.
I've never seen the men so happy.<eos> So engaged.<eos> I talk to them, of course.<eos> I make sure they're fed, but this was living.<eos> They were alive.<eos> I must be going. May I leave this here?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> My coat?<eos> Ah, I hung it up.
Any word from James?<eos> No.<eos> I left another message at the Australian, this morning.<eos> It's gone on long enough, with your campaign about to begin in Ernest.<eos> Well, I'm sure, he won't do anything to cast a shadow on that.<eos> Miss Olivia?<eos> Please, go away.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> A parcel arrived for you.<eos> I don't want it.
- Come on, Melly!<eos> - I found it.<eos> - Sorry, I can't hear you.<eos> Say it again.<eos> I had another look for that blue Corsa.<eos> There's a junction three streets away from the warehouse we never checked.<eos> Come on, Melly!<eos> I found it and I got the reg.<eos> But the owner said he sold the car at a car auction about a month ago.<eos> Who bought it?
- Looks good to me.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm your big brother.<eos> - You wanted to see me, ma'am?<eos> - Sit down, please.<eos> I've been impressed with your performance these past few months.<eos> I think you would be a good fit in CID.<eos> Most people are happy to be promoted, Sergeant.<eos> As long as I'm not being bought off, ma'am.<eos> Jo, whatever you might think of me, I do recognise talent when I see it.
The mental strain is too much!<eos> What's Tony doing up there?<eos> Somehow Thanos is transmitting this signal all over the planet.<eos> He's destroying the Avengers.<eos> What if they can't stop him?<eos> We need another plan, we're not making a dent!<eos> I think I know someone who can.<eos> - DAN, the Data Analysis Network.<eos> - But your satellite's not a weapon.<eos> Ant-Man used it to fire Pym Particles.
Thank God whatever this thing is is considered a sport.<eos> Bart Simpson to the gate, please.<eos> Oh, good, we're just in time.<eos> Hmm. It's not the size of the pennant.<eos> It's what you do with it.<eos> All right, nobody likes a showoff.<eos> Oh, man, I love to see this.<eos> Simpson's setting up for his signature suicide no-hander 540 crank-flip!<eos> I'mdoingit !<eos> I'm doing it!
Okay, they're dropping back.<eos> All right, come on!<eos> Let's go!<eos> he car!<eos> Are you high?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> But we still got to bail.<eos> You're not taking my favorite car.<eos> My son and I bought that car from a repo man. Built it from the ground up.<eos> I'll be damned if I'm gonna let some common marauder steal it in broad daylight!
While cooking this filet mignon, I'm in fighting mode.<eos> I'm looking for revenge, I'm pissed.<eos> I need to make the best steak possible.<eos> I've got to really make sure that I'm searing well and basting well, and getting that steak in the oven in a timely manner, because if I don't, it's not gonna have enough time to rest,<eos> Feel good?<eos> Confident?<eos> I feel good.<eos> I got a nice sear, I think.<eos> I'm second-guessing myself, and my brain is just running 800 miles a minute.<eos> I can see right away that I didn't sear it off well enough and I have to do something.
Is that why she went in to investigate?<eos> To protect Frankie?<eos> No comment.<eos> The night Stevie was murdered, the car she was shot from... was left at a scrapyard.<eos> It's a blue Mondeo.<eos> Do you recognise this car?<eos> - No?<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> But you know who dumped it.

In a minute he'll say he's been to the moon.<eos> - Have you been to the moon? - Dad!<eos> Now I'm the crazy one!<eos> - What are you looking at?<eos> - It's not me.<eos> It's him!<eos> Get moving! Haven't you ever seen a woman?<eos> This is Sunflowers!<eos> This painting is touching!<eos> It's much better in real life, I'd seen it only in pictures.

Haven't you ever seen a woman?<eos> This is Sunflowers!<eos> This painting is touching!<eos> It's much better in real life, I'd seen it only in pictures.<eos> On the butcher's calendar, remember?<eos> I saw it in a retrospective on Van Gogh at the MOMA. - Nice!
Because the stress hasn't gone, it's doubled!<eos> I'm going home tomorrow, hear me?<eos> Oh God, I feel ill!<eos> Palpitations!<eos> Are you happy your mother feels ill?<eos> Sit down.<eos> It's your fault too, ordering mussels in Amsterdam!<eos> You stuffed yourself! Let me feel your heartbeat.<eos> The jugular vein, feel it.<eos> "When Beatrice I saw turned toward her left, and looking at the sun; no eagle ever gazed at it so keenly..."
She... She closes down.<eos> Okay.<eos> Had it been Linnea we'd have been told everything together several times all the details, just everything.<eos> But then it wouldn't have happened.<eos> -I only have wine.<eos> No, it's fine, thank you.<eos> I'm looking forward to reading your book.<eos> -Two seconds, I'll just... 19-10, come in...<eos> Several people in the department still talk about -When you were with us and solved that kidnapping scandal.<eos> I actually take it up in the book.
Karen Winslow:<eos> My god, you look awful!<eos> What happened ?<eos> My car broke down.<eos> It's freezing outside.<eos> Have yourself a good drink, sweety. I have something that will warm you up.<eos> The aunt of Richard Forrester received a call from Sweden this morning.<eos> I brought her in and she confirmed that it was from Richard.<eos> - Can I have the number?<eos> - I just texted it to you.
- Bye, sweeey..<eos> I no longer have a problem bending down.<eos> I don't like the idea of this clamp<eos> You'll see what I do on stage..<eos> - See you tonight.<eos> - Tell your mother to take care of you..<eos> Hi, Ingvar. I talked to Karen.<eos> The FBI found his number.<eos> Could you find his location?<eos> I just sent it to you
If anyone exhales, I'll go right out of the window.<eos> Erm, Stuart, I was wondering if there was any word on the budget for the wedding.<eos> So far, we can only afford a very limited guest list.<eos> How limited?<eos> Just the two of you.<eos> Well, Freddie's about to book a big job.<eos> He had a brilliant audition.<eos> Didn't you, Freddie?<eos> They're all brilliant.<eos> Anyway, I'm sure I'll get it, unless they want to go with a bigger name.
Send him away.<eos> Tell Halima to get him out of the city.<eos> He-he cannot be here.<eos> He can't know who I am.<eos> I realize this isn't how you intended this to happen.<eos> But he's come all this way and he's got the money that we need.<eos> What money?<eos> He doesn't have any money.<eos> Yes, he does.<eos> He inherited it when you died.
I guess I'm going back to my room to pack.<eos> So you haven't heard anything?<eos> Well, I-I don't even know if he's made the call yet.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> Every hour is precious.<eos> That sandstorm is going to come and go.<eos> And once it is gone, we have lost our window.<eos> I need a way to reach out to Khalil directly.<eos> I know you have his number.<eos> You need to give it to me.
"When the brain is deprived of oxygen, "it induces a semi-hallucinogenic state called hypoxia.<eos> - "Combined with orgasm..."<eos> - I know what it is.<eos> ".. the rush is said to be no less powerful than cocaine, "and highly addictive."<eos> You know what it is, because you've tried it?<eos> - There was a guy.<eos> - A man... .. Steve Fields.<eos> Did the two of you use a trunk?<eos> We used a belt.<eos> I didn't particularly enjoy it.
- I lied.<eos> About?<eos> I stole something... from the attic.<eos> You lied well.<eos> It's a locked cylinder.<eos> - You lied wisely.<eos> - It needs a code.<eos> - Which you don't know?<eos> - No.<eos> Did Alex intend it for you?
The quid pro quo is that I will not be.<eos> You've been hanging around too many street corners, old friend.<eos> Your acquaintance is beginning to rub off on you.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I learnt these tricks from the top.<eos> - You sure you want to continue down this road?<eos> - Quite sure.<eos> That's an awful shame.<eos> I'll tell you a joke. How about that?<eos> It would depend on how funny I found it.
Vision enough to know when I'm being manipulated into risking my life for someone else's pipe dream.<eos> Your dream?<eos> Revenge? That's just vanity, Mr. Ward.<eos> That's weakness.<eos> Don't talk to me about weakness, old man.<eos> Weakness is following others blindly.<eos> Learned that the hard way.<eos> I'm not asking you to follow.<eos> I'm asking you to lead!<eos> I've been waiting for this moment for a long time, yes, but I'd hoped that I'd find someone to seize it with me.
Dominic, you're here early. How are you?<eos> Good.<eos> In fact, I was just thinking about the last time I was here.<eos> You were helping me become CEO.<eos> Oh, come on, you pretty much became CEO all on your own.<eos> Well, it doesn't matter how I got there.<eos> You're gonna help me stay there.<eos> What's that?<eos> The future of battery-powered engines.<eos> We need it, or we don't survive.
I didn't want this.<eos> I feared this.<eos> If Dominic buys Range Tech, he's in huge trouble.<eos> And if we tell him that without having a solution, he'll fire us.<eos> That's the thing. I have a solution.<eos> I found a company that has a battery division that we can buy.<eos> Now, we just have to approach them and--<eos> No. Did you not just hear what I said?<eos> We cannot jeopardize his deal.<eos> We won't be jeopardizing it if we can get them to sign a nondisclosure agreement.
He said he felt guilty about it.<eos> So he came to you to continue taking risks until he finally lost $50 million and then admitted to being guilty.<eos> That is not what she said.<eos> I'm sorry, he just felt guilty.<eos> You want to drop this now, or do you want us to hand this tape over to the SEC?<eos> Dr. Agard, did you want to give the testimony you just gave?<eos> - Of course not.<eos> - And why is that?<eos> Because I care about my clients.<eos> Is it possible that you didn't want to give it because it's not true?
You see, the bottom line is, is that we were both right when we tried to do this deal with Tanaka.<eos> And now that we've got nothing to hide from you, there is nothing to stop us from finding you someone else.<eos> So, instead of standing here kissing my ass, why don't you get to work doing that?<eos> If you're here to apologize, I'm not interested.<eos> I'm not here to apologize.<eos> I'm here because I need to look at your files.<eos> There really is no end to your arrogance.<eos> I wouldn't ask if this wasn't the only way to keep Sam out of prison.<eos> I'm not giving you Sam Tull's file.<eos> And I'm not asking for it.
Oh, so comet knocked out of orbit is now heading towards Earth.<eos> Is that bad?<eos> Blow up the whole world!<eos> But you can fix it, right?<eos> You wanted to see me, Daddy?<eos> Nefera, what do you know about the great comet that will arrive tomorrow night?<eos> Do you understand its importance to our Egyptian scaritage?<eos> Yeah. I understand it got me a free trip to Boo York.<eos> Centuries ago, a small piece of that comet broke away and landed in the Sa-horror desert.<eos> Our people found it.
Isn't that right, Seth?<eos> Yes, Mother.<eos> I presume there will be a promise ceremony later tonight with the Ptolemy boy?<eos> Of course, Daddy.<eos> I've got Cleo exactly where I want her...<eos> The great comet hurtling through space, brimming with magical energy.<eos> And tonight, she visits us once more.<eos> Our ancestors believed the great comet was a gift from the others above.<eos> A mysterious race of beings who live beyond the stars.<eos> Why did they send it?
What if he knew that they wanted to bring<eos> - this creature back through it? - Oh, come on.<eos> What, an ancient alien god?<eos> Are you people hearing the words coming out of your mouths?<eos> - The world's changing.<eos> Deal with it. - You were there.<eos> - Did you see it?<eos> What's it like? - I did see it.<eos> But I can't really describe what it looked like.<eos> It's more how it felt, which is old and pained, as if it once had great power but lost it.
Prelim hearing, Krantz v. Ramirez.<eos> Counsel?<eos> Your Honor, my client, Victor Ramirez, has resided at 887 Oak for nine years.<eos> On June 5, landlord Albert T. Krantz attempted to raise monthly rent to $750, violating section 2-9A of the Idaho general statu... statute.<eos> Um, I have a question.<eos> Have you ever talked before?<eos> Nice.<eos> He claims that by missing the March payment, you violated the terms of the lease, giving him cause to terminate and issue you a new lease at, essentially, whatever rate he wants.<eos> We didn't miss payment.<eos> He just never cash it.
The stuff you wipe away every morning when you wake up.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> This is getting us nowhere.<eos> OK, how, Doctor, how can those things be made of "sleep dust"?<eos> Well, when we sleep, the mucus crust builds up in our eyes.<eos> Blood cells.<eos> Skin cells.<eos> That's what dust largely is.<eos> Human skin.<eos> But your meddling has evolved it.
- Not this time.<eos> There is a feed.<eos> Wireless.<eos> These images are being stored by someone. Collated.<eos> Nagata, look at this footage!<eos> What's wrong with it?<eos> - What's wrong with it?<eos> - Don't know.<eos> Look, there's one very obvious thing about it.<eos> Do you see it yet?
Hungry.<eos> Always so hungry.<eos> I made them understand.<eos> We had to find a way out.<eos> And then there'd be new food sources.<eos> Unlimited.<eos> So, they spared me.<eos> And we waited.<eos> You and your cargo?<eos> I got it in here while you were all distracted.
You're a desperate man in here.<eos> You want to regain your power and free yourself, and you and I both know that you're enacting Lazarus one.<eos> You can either tell me who you're working with now, or I will find them and kill them.<eos> It's as if you've learned nothing from me.<eos> I think I failed with you.<eos> Did he succeed?<eos> Did he do the impossible?<eos> Is Olivia Pope her father's success story?<eos> Did he go too far?<eos> Did Olivia Pope's manufactured sense of privilege make her feel so entitled to that brass ring of power that she simply took it instead of earning it?
You're crazy. Is that it?<eos> You're one of those crazy chicks?<eos> I'm offering you a job.<eos> - A job?<eos> - A job.<eos> Olivia Pope and associates needs a mouthpiece.<eos> You're good with the press.<eos> You won't just be some corporate spinner.<eos> You'll be one of us.<eos> Look, the job is yours if you want it.
The White House.<eos> One day, I'd really love to work there.<eos> I want to impact a national agenda that drives America forward.<eos> What better, more influential place to do that than the White House?<eos> A few short years later,<eos> Olivia Pope would, in fact, have a seat at the world's most powerful table, next to a man she helped get elected.<eos> Is Olivia Pope a political savant?<eos> Or a woman so ambitious she would do anything to get where she wanted to go?<eos> No one is gonna be taking pictures of you from that apartment anymore.<eos> I rented it, several hundred dollars above market.
- Perkins told me something different.<eos> Phone's been ringing off the hook since I got here.<eos> - Anybody gonna answer that?<eos> - You have to leave.<eos> - He doesn't know what he's talking about.<eos> - Liv said that we had...<eos> Liv said for me to handle things.<eos> That's what I'm doing.<eos> It's handled.<eos> Everything I said earlier still holds, but I need the cash, and I might as well take it from you guys while you still have it to offer.
How come whenever a woman does something that people don't like the only way these men on the Internet know how to express themselves is by threatening rape?<eos> Listen.<eos> Turn off the computer, Liv.<eos> No, seriously.<eos> I have... At least 1,000 threats of rape here, just on this one site, from guys who are mad that I had the audacity to be born female and black.<eos> Olivia... Turn off the computer.<eos> Do you think if I told them I own a gun and that I've shot someone, they'd threaten to rape me?<eos> Do you think if I told them I've survived being kidnapped and tortured, they would get that their weak little misspellings barely make me blink?<eos> That I would welcome the chance to take out a little bit of PTSD on the next man who put his hands on me?<eos> You think they'd still want to... turn off the computer now, or I will come over there, walk through all the reporters outside your building, and turn it off for you.
You got a visitor.<eos> Who?<eos> Your lawyer.<eos> My lawyer?<eos> I told you I'd be in touch, Scott.<eos> I'm starting to think that you prefer the inside of a jail cell.<eos> Oh man.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Sir, I'm sorry I stole the suit.<eos> I don't even want to know why you have it.
].<eos> He is a criminal.<eos> I'm your daughter.<eos> NO!<eos> She's right, Hank.<eos> I'm not your guy.<eos> Why don't you wear the suit?<eos> You think I don't want to?<eos> I can't.<eos> I spent years wearing it.
I ruined the moment didn't I.<eos> Yes, you did, yes.<eos> I'm going to make some tea.<eos> Nailed it!<eos> That's a good boy, Antony.<eos> The final phase of your training will be a stealth incursion.<eos> It's freezing!<eos> You couldn't make a simple flannel lining?<eos> We must retrieve this prototype of a signal decoy, it's a device that I invented from my SHIELD days.<eos> We need it to counteract the transmission blockers that Cross installed in the Futures vault.
- because... what's his name?<eos> - Ken Song.<eos> Yeah, well, when we got there, he was hanging with this lady, and all making out.<eos> It was gross.<eos> She got upset and left for some reason.<eos> Then he started hitting on my friend Alison, and she was like, "ugh," and had to push him off of her.<eos> Is this the lady he was making out with?<eos> No, she was more brunette.<eos> So, when did you send the video in to the address on the flyer?<eos> Right after I got it, so, near my birthday...
I'm just preparing myself for Jack's gloating.<eos> Don't tell me this case is gonna be dismissed.<eos> Well, the guy has a video alibi.<eos> Now, if he is in a conspiracy with Lisa's sister, we won't have evidence of that today.<eos> Don't worry about it, Chief.<eos> Mary may not have been present at the crime, but now I'm pretty sure that the baby was, which explains the heel mark on Lisa's blouse.<eos> I do have to go.<eos> Amy, come with me, please.<eos> What?<eos> The baby did it?
Hey, we played fair and square.<eos> It's a nice try, Nate.<eos> But the program runs on a cellphone, and the Dickerhoofs were not allowed to have one during the race.<eos> But you did have one, and we have a warrant allowing us to examine it.<eos> I don't understand, Nate.<eos> You said the Cochrans were gold.<eos> Why would you want them off your show?<eos> My show.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Yeah, I conceived it. I produced it.
- Like does Hamilton/Lockwood provide health insurance?<eos> What does that have to do with anything?<eos> Wait, before you answer, I need you to revoke your rights.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I-I revoke.<eos> I have excellent health insurance.<eos> Hamilton/Lookwood allows me to see any doctor I want with extremely low deductibles, and the prescription plan is awesome.<eos> Anything else?<eos> You said the promotion you missed came with stock options and a bonus of?<eos> The entire package was worth almost $2 million, but I don't know how that's relevant because I didn't get it.
Oh. Okay.<eos> Oh. You've gotten several of those messages, Hank.<eos> Assuming you are HamptDoc17?<eos> I hope it's not an emergency.<eos> Oh, that.<eos> Uh, yeah, no, it's not.<eos> It's probably just my Insta Tweet chat feed loop.<eos> It's a dating website.<eos> I, um, I signed up a few weeks back but I kinda thought the well had gone dry.<eos> Well, perhaps Rinpoche's spirit is re-infusing it.
She...<eos> - What?<eos> - She's with Raj.<eos> Oh. Of course.<eos> I don't know what I was thinking.<eos> Guess I'm a little off my game.<eos> I'll say. I wasn't expecting you till Friday.<eos> Did you not get my voice-mail?<eos> No, I got it.<eos> But apparently I misunderstood it.
(Hank) Yep.<eos> And the robotic arms are so precise, Rinpoche will barely have a scar.<eos> Used to be for a procedure like this, you'd have to crack open the entire ribcage.<eos> Will it work, Hank?<eos> It should.<eos> It should.<eos> When I was 18, with far too much money and not enough sense, I went off to Tibet in search of a... searching.<eos> I'd heard of a hidden monastery that had escaped China's purges.<eos> I was possessed with the romantic idea of... finding it, and...<eos> And then eventually, I did find it.
I'm attached already now, man.<eos> It's great.<eos> Hey, you want to feed her?<eos> No, Vin.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> Who gave it to you?<eos> What?<eos> Who gave you the phone, Vin?<eos> Who gave it?
They'd probably do a fine job.<eos> But only I handle the cash and manage the accounts.<eos> How long until the funds are accessible?<eos> Like any other bank... 24 hours.<eos> I mean, you're handing me millions, right?<eos> It's not gonna count itself.<eos> Listen, it's my understanding...<eos> This numbskull's gonna make it easy for us.<eos> I mean, he literally brings the money to us.<eos> We count it, catalog it, send it to the Federal freakin' Reserve.
Get off me.<eos> All right.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's get this thing going.<eos> I believe you both wrote your own vows.<eos> Oh, yes!<eos> I wrote them down and gave them to Violet to hold.<eos> Can I have the paper, please?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, darling.<eos> I left it on the kitchen counter.
I'm gonna...<eos> I'm gonna go for it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, you don't think I'm too tan, do you?<eos> - No, you're perfect. - Oh.<eos> Vanessa and I worked in the same cell phone store.<eos> I was attracted to her fearless way, just sort of bulldozing through life, and she was attracted to my friend Ethan. Uh-huh.<eos> But, one night, she got her cell phone stolen and I helped her trace it.<eos> Finally got it back at 4:00 a.m. in Temecula, and then we... slept together.
M-Maybe it's better not to be stuffed.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> I'll pack your food.<eos> You don't know when you'll have a chance for another meal.<eos> I'm too scared to eat.<eos> Like this.<eos> Now try again.<eos> - Zaher? - Ah.<eos> How's your foot?<eos> Ah. Better since you wrapped it.
I thought you weren't curious!<eos> Officer Choi...<eos> Why would Officer Choi do that?<eos> To Na Bong Sun. Why?<eos> Think carefully.<eos> Does anything stand out?<eos> When you possessed Na Bong Sun, did anything happen with him?<eos> When I possessed her?<eos> Now that you mention it... I went to see Officer Choi.<eos> I asked him if he's sure about Shin Soon Ae's suicide and to look into it.
Where should we go?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Officer Han.<eos> Officer Kang, do you perhaps... have reason to be suspicious of Officer Choi?<eos> Tip?<eos> Yes.<eos> They told me that a tip came in regarding Officer Choi.<eos> Something regarding bribes and so on.<eos> I can't give you specifics.<eos> People at the top told me to look into it.
Where the hell are you?<eos> You know, it's customary to bring a gift for a housewarming.<eos> Maybe a nice bottle of wine.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> I suppose we could bottle that rage and drink it instead.<eos> You're right... I'm not the savior.<eos> Glad you finally caught up with the rest of us.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> I know the only way to stop the fury is to pay its price.<eos> - Then why aren't you off paying it?
I know when you're quoting something.<eos> And I love that you never know what it is.<eos> Anyway, with a bit of luck, we can put Excalibur together tomorrow, and then... bam...<eos> No more darkness.<eos> Be careful, Emma. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Calm down, Swan.<eos> I'm not proposing.<eos> You know I'm a survivor.<eos> This ring is why.<eos> I've had it for many years.
Look what's become of it.<eos> My house was... Was right here.<eos> Or maybe... Maybe it was there.<eos> Oh, it's so different now.<eos> Sometimes the sole survivor of a tragedy can feel guilty.<eos> In the future, they'll call it...<eos> I don't feel guilty.<eos> I feel angry.<eos> This shouldn't be the way that those who cannot take are taken.<eos> If I had magic like yours, if I had a million lifetimes to hand out power to those who need it and to strike down those who...
I feel angry.<eos> This shouldn't be the way that those who cannot take are taken.<eos> If I had magic like yours, if I had a million lifetimes to hand out power to those who need it and to strike down those who...<eos> Nimue, shh. It's been decided.<eos> Look.<eos> In the street, cups.<eos> It looks like every household brought out their cups for him.<eos> Why would they d... Oh!<eos> He was questing for the Grail and torching down each hiding place...<eos> As he annihilated it.
Those shackles aren't the problem.<eos> This one is.<eos> When Regina put it back on, she enchanted my wrist, and I can't cut it off.<eos> Without magic, we're never gonna get out of here alive.<eos> It's a good thing I happen to have some then.<eos> What?<eos> You've got magic?<eos> No.<eos> My hook does.<eos> As you recall, I imbued it with magic to rip your heart out.
Perhaps I... dabble with magic.<eos> Good.<eos> 'Cause I need some.<eos> Invaders are attacking from the south.<eos> If I'm to lead the clans to victory over 'em, I'm gonna need some magic. Hmm...<eos> Something to ensure the future of my kingdom.<eos> Yes.<eos> I can help you.<eos> But I must warn you, it won't come cheap.<eos> Whatever your price is, I'll pay it.
My father would never stoop so low.<eos> Well, he did not stoop... except to get through the door.<eos> But he did come for magic... an enchanted helm, to be exact, one that glistens like the sun.<eos> Merida, I'm afraid that is your father's mark.<eos> Unfortunately, King Fergus died before he could pay me what he owed.<eos> Um, with interest... 10,000 gold sceats.<eos> That much gold would bankrupt the clans three times over.<eos> If you don't have the gold, you could simply return the helm.<eos> I can't return what I don't have.<eos> Then you best find it.

Harder than it looks, dear.<eos> If you ever hope to wear that crown, you need to figure out how to do what your father couldn't...<eos> Lead.<eos> Got to be here somewhere.<eos> You won't find the helm here.<eos> I will if you help me look.<eos> Check that sideboard.<eos> No, you won't find it because it's not here.<eos> I packed that helm in dad's trunk myself when we left to fight the Southern invaders.<eos> You mean he was wearing it when...
Well, it can't be that rough if they're writing their sweethearts back home.<eos> Those aren't love notes, Lassie.<eos> They're wills.<eos> They think they're gonna die?<eos> You wanted to know what war was like.<eos> I'm afraid this is it.<eos> What's that?<eos> Ah! It's me war bow.<eos> I carried this into me first battle I ever fought.<eos> I thought it only fitting for you to carry it into your first battle.
And it's the only way I'll ever get my knights to stand up to Merlin and the Dark One.<eos> No, my dad would never use magic to force people to fight for him.<eos> Aww, apparently, daddy dearest wasn't the great king that you thought he was.<eos> Back off.<eos> We need that helm to stop the witch from cursing this land.<eos> I'm afraid you're gonna have to find some other way to do that.<eos> And who will even notice?<eos> These people are practically animals already.<eos> Even if we wanted to give it to you, we can't.<eos> We don't have it.
- What?<eos> It was a piece of iron polished to a shine.<eos> When I put it on to rally my men, it didn't do anything.<eos> We lost the battle.<eos> Dad must've thrown the helm he got from the witch into the sea before the battle began.<eos> And you know what this means, right?<eos> He didn't use magic to lead the troops into battle.<eos> They followed him because they believed in him.<eos> Oh, as touching as this family drama is, we need the helm.<eos> And I'm gonna do whatever it takes to stop you from leaving DunBroch with it.
We couldn't let our queen fall.<eos> After all this... you still want me to be your queen?<eos> You were willing to give up your crown for the good of the kingdom, give up your life to get that helm.<eos> I only ever saw one person make a sacrifice like that, and it was your father.<eos> If you're not fit to lead the clans, no one is.<eos> Presenting Queen Merida of DunBroch, leader of the clans, protector of the highlands, and my daughter.<eos> You're early.<eos> The sun's nearly set.<eos> Unless you want to rule over a kingdom of bears, you better have me helm.<eos> Oh, I have it, but I'm not gonna hand it over to you.
Merida...<eos> You did it.<eos> You became queen.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> For what?<eos> I lost faith in you.<eos> I thought you used the enchanted helm to lead your troops into battle.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I lost faith in meself when I went to the witch for that helm.<eos> Why didn't you use it?
Oh, God.<eos> I ca... may I... I can't take any more.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> I can't.<eos> Captain, I think I found something.<eos> I was looking at the Marvin Niel identity...<eos> He was reported missing in L.A.<eos> By a woman named Dolly Bowen four weeks ago.<eos> Why didn't that pop up when we first ran the name?<eos> Dolly withdrew the report just three days after she filed it.
Last year, late season, I started having shoulder trouble.<eos> I didn't tell anybody about it because I knew it would affect me going free-agent.<eos> But the pain got worse.<eos> Turns out, I tore some cartilage.<eos> I needed surgery.<eos> So, last night, you were having an operation?<eos> Minimally invasive, simple.<eos> Should heal in six weeks.<eos> But you can see why I don't want this getting out.<eos> This arm is worth over $100 million, and I'd let you cut it off right now if it meant getting back my little girl.
But Kayla was...<eos> She was already dead.<eos> Still not murder.<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> - Jim... He's my friend.<eos> What is it, then?<eos> Hold on. Let's... let's hear the whole story.<eos> I was just trying to protect him.<eos> I thought a kidnapping would look better than what happened, so I helped Lori wrap up Kayla's body.<eos> And I put it in a box.
Well, I happen to be in the middle of trying to get Louis's sister out of a huge mess, so--<eos> That's what I wanted to talk to you about.<eos> Louis promised to stay out of this.<eos> And he is, and I'm not here because he asked me to be.<eos> I'm here because I care about him and--<eos> That's not my problem.<eos> Harvey, I'm not the enemy here.<eos> And Louis is your partner and your friend, and right now, he needs a little reassurance.<eos> And I told you before, I'm not the guy that gives you a hug when you're scared.<eos> I'm the guy that wins when you need it the most.
Do you really think Robert Zane is dirty enough to do that?<eos> I don't know, but I find it hard to believe that he's dumb enough not to know.<eos> My dad's not dumb.<eos> - And he's not dirty.<eos> - Rachel...<eos> And the last time someone called him shady, it was Louis, and you almost punched him over it.<eos> This is different.<eos> This is the same.<eos> You were gonna punch him because an attack on me is an attack on you.<eos> Well, attack on my father is an attack on me, and you're the one who's doing it.

A contract that explicitly states that any product Alyssa Lang developed during her employment is the property of our client.<eos> Unfortunately that contract is unenforceable.<eos> It is unless I woke up in Russia this morning.<eos> Your Honor, I have here a copy of Alyssa Lang's birth certificate.<eos> She may have signed that contract, but it isn't binding because she was only 16 at the time.<eos> What?<eos> Your Honor, I know this man, and that document could have come from anywhere.<eos> Get it verified by the labs at Quantico.<eos> All it's gonna prove is that Alyssa Lang had no legal capacity to sign.<eos> It doesn't matter how old she was when she signed it.
There's nothing in that complaint that isn't factually correct.<eos> You are twisting those facts and you could ruin a man's life, and you know it.<eos> Oh, and how is that different from what he's doing to me?<eos> - It's completely different.<eos> - Is it?<eos> I worked for that man 60 hours a week for 10 years, and now that I want to start my own company, he not only wants to crush me, but he told people I stole the idea.<eos> If that's not ruining a person's life, then I don't know what is.<eos> Oh, and as far as Travis Tanner goes, sexual harassment wasn't his idea.<eos> It was mine.<eos> And when he tried to talk me out of it, I told him he could either get on board or watch me get another lawyer.
I got you the special.<eos> Did you say no pickles?<eos> You didn't say no pickles.<eos> I didn't say, "Order my lunch."<eos> So sue me.<eos> You send the notification over to Tanner?<eos> Two hours ago.<eos> Then it won't be long.<eos> What?<eos> I didn't say anything about your state of mind after Tim Petroff because I wasn't worried about it then,
- It was the right thing to do.<eos> - You lying piece of shit.<eos> Watch it, Jack.<eos> You're talking to a name partner.<eos> And you're saying that he's lying, but as head of the compensation committee, you had access to Harvey's salary.<eos> I didn't leave that document out and I can prove it.<eos> - How is that?<eos> - I know for a fact that--<eos> Oh, let me help you out.<eos> The reason you stopped yourself is that you were going to say Louis left it out.
Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go.<eos> I was 12.<eos> You played it yesterday.<eos> Careful, Eric.<eos> But that was an easy one.<eos> Ooh, ooh, here's one.<eos> What's my favorite poem?<eos> She Walks in Beauty by Lord Byron.<eos> That is my favorite poem.<eos> Would you like me to recite it for you?
Phil, come on, I'm hungry!<eos> Dude, what's the rush?<eos> Our reservation isn't until 8:00.<eos> Wow.<eos> That is some watch.<eos> Let me see that.<eos> Is it new?<eos> - This?<eos> Oh, yeah, kind of, kind of.<eos> Where'd you get it?
Eh, she's pretty nervous about seeing her mother after all these years.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, you know what, I gotta go.<eos> It's Cisco.<eos> It's about Professor Stein.<eos> Okay, go.<eos> I'll cover you with Singh.<eos> All right, thanks.<eos> Well, I must admit, I never imagined the Sphinx's riddle about a man requiring three legs would ever apply to me, but if this device keeps me mobile, then I will gratefully oblige.<eos> Hopefully, you won't need it for much longer.
Oh, that rolled off your tongue awfully easy.<eos> You don't trust me?<eos> How dare you.<eos> I'll be waiting for an apology.<eos> And if you're smart, there will be candy.<eos> Are you happy?<eos> You just hurt white roommate's feelings.<eos> Hi, hi.<eos> What is with that giant bag?<eos> Did you have to climb up a beanstalk to get it?
Ah.<eos> What's this?<eos> Where's the couch?<eos> What'd you do with the couch? !<eos> I-I bought a new one.<eos> It's nice, right?<eos> You idiot!<eos> My money was in that couch!<eos> What?<eos> That's where I hid it.
Haskell, Haskell.<eos> Hands, hands, hands.<eos> I will tell you when we're calm.<eos> All right, we're calm. - Calm.<eos> - Where's the couch?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Here come the hands. - No!<eos> Come on, stop it.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Look, what I mean is, Goodwill came to pick it up.
Hands, hands, hands.<eos> I will tell you when we're calm.<eos> All right, we're calm. - Calm.<eos> - Where's the couch?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Here come the hands. - No!<eos> Come on, stop it.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Look, what I mean is, Goodwill came to pick it up.<eos> I just don't know which one they took it to.
All right, we're calm. - Calm.<eos> - Where's the couch?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Here come the hands. - No!<eos> Come on, stop it.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Look, what I mean is, Goodwill came to pick it up.<eos> I just don't know which one they took it to.<eos> All right, here's what we're gonna do.<eos> We're gonna call them and track it down.
Twice?<eos> Do I look like Jay Z?<eos> No, you do not.<eos> Hello, can I help you?<eos> So sorry to intrude. I'm Haskell.<eos> This is my dear friend, Phil, and the other one is Stuart.<eos> We donated the couch to Goodwill.<eos> Oh, come in. Come in.<eos> What if they don't want to sell?<eos> They've only had it for one night.
Oh, yes, I did.<eos> It's cruel, almost unmerciful.<eos> What?<eos> I'm going to unleash the Lutzes.<eos> Hey, Stuart.<eos> 'Sup, buddy?<eos> Come on, man.<eos> Say something.<eos> I had an award-winning group for three years.<eos> You destroyed it in two days.
Do we really have to ski the last run of the day?<eos> I'm tired.<eos> What do you suggest, honey?<eos> Whining our way down the mountain?<eos> Come on!<eos> The whole point of this ski trip is to ski.<eos> I thought the point was to wear cute winter outfits and drink hot toddies.<eos> And aren't we pushing our luck?<eos> I mean, this peak isn't called "avalanche mountain" for nothing.<eos> It's only called avalanche mountain because of the French explorer who first climbed it:
Okay.<eos> It was so great meeting you, Ramon...<eos> And Linda and Minda.<eos> Oh, the night is just beginning.<eos> Computer: Commence phase two in one minute.<eos> What's phase two?<eos> Sex.<eos> You know, doing it.<eos> Boonga-boonga.<eos> Except now we do it in the sex machine.
Look, I'm not a lawyer, but if you'll let me, I'd like to help you become an American.<eos> Ms. Corinth, that is most kind of you, but I could not possibly impose on your generosity.<eos> My brother-in-law is a member of the Senate subcommittee on immigration.<eos> I would be honored to accept your assistance.<eos> I'll call you?<eos> I look forward to it.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> As if Adams would have done any different.<eos> PANDORA: This was not a random choice.<eos> The knife senses only the deepest pain, seeks it out and channels it like a forge, out of which you emerge reborn, as you were meant to be.
The two Wltnesses will seek to stop you.<eos> Bury your new power deep into their hearts and bring me back what I desire:<eos> a destiny that favors the strong and destroys the weak.<eos> You're certain this Nelson Meyers is the man we seek?<eos> Profile points to a white male, mid-20s, loner type.<eos> Someone who had access to the building that the victim was killed in; and Nelson's the only one who didn't show up for work today.<eos> How does turning this man into a murderer further Pandora's agenda?<eos> Everything she's thrown at us has some kind of personal connection.<eos> She knows our past, our secrets.<eos> There's definitely a pattern; just haven't figured it out yet.
From those tables over there, you can see anyone coming a long way off.<eos> which is why you never sit at the counter.<eos> Keep your hands where I can see them.<eos> This is just a conversation.<eos> I already sold the Shard.<eos> This Shard?<eos> Hidden compartment in your car battery.<eos> Where have I seen that trick before?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> August Corbin taught it to me.
Or Howe.<eos> Why steal a 200-year-old skeleton?<eos> A lot of skid marks, like the driver was trying to avoid something.<eos> Or someone.<eos> Pandora.<eos> What would she want with Howe's remains?<eos> Tracks are headed that way.<eos> Feel like hunting?<eos> I know this place.<eos> The British employed it as a staging ground during the invasion of Manhattan.
A valiant battle, General.<eos> Now one more bud to blossom one more here to sting.<eos> Love... is what the victors bring.<eos> We're glad to hear the Jeffersonian's decided to take Washington's tomb under its jurisdiction.<eos> Oh, I'd start by getting rid of the napalm first.<eos> The Jeffersonian would love your help with the excavation, Mr. Crane. Ooh.<eos> Well, I'm flattered, but I am in the process of renovating a historical property of my own.<eos> Too bad.<eos> The site poses more than a few questions.<eos> If colonial Americans had Greek fire, why didn't they use it during the battles of the Revolution?
He was forever boasting about his part in designing a new currency.<eos> In fact... he wrote a treatise on the Eye of Providence.<eos> 'Tis in The First Book of the Masonic Law.<eos> Which I'm gonna just assume we have upstairs?<eos> No.<eos> 'Tis the most important text in the Masonic order.<eos> Its pages are privy only to Grand Master Masons.<eos> One copy exists.<eos> 'Tis kept in the chapter room of the oldest lodge house in the Masonic Order.<eos> The book has the answers, we go and get it.
"When something looks too perfect, it probably sucks."<eos> Yeah, I'm pretty sure Thor never said anything remotely like that.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> How do you know?<eos> Do you know Thor? - Have you talked to him recently?<eos> - No, but...<eos> Well, because I have, mm-hmm.<eos> And I don't recall him mentioning you.<eos> Look, I just have a feeling about this place, and I think we all know what happens when I get a feeling.<eos> - We ignore it?
Hookfang! What are you doing?<eos> I don't know why I'm doing this, but here goes nothing.<eos> You want Hookfang's girlfriend, you got to go through...<eos> What are you guys doing here?<eos> - Not that I'm complaining.<eos> - We came to convince you not to quit.<eos> You wanna tell us what's going on here?<eos> It looks like two male dragons fighting over a female.<eos> Yeah, I've heard male Vikings do it too, but I've personally never seen it.<eos> But the Titan Wing heard the female's mating call, too, - and was drawn to it.
! It sounded As a shot!<eos> Hell!<eos> Call from 5-0, co-workers under In politihuset in Skånegatan.<eos> it happened in stairwell three, That goes to the garage.<eos> -The garage. Devil ...<eos> - All free resources there now!<eos> Officer on duty last jul have Ordered a lockdown.<eos> Politihuset should be secured, All outputs are blocked.<eos> Lockdown?<eos> I never thought I was going to experience it.
John was arrested by that bloody January Ossian!<eos> No one knows what happened to the chaos in the brig!<eos> Summarizes the idiot what he sets out with ? !<eos> Linnea, did you get account statements?<eos> Yes, but I have not had time to check everything.<eos> Foreign banks the most.<eos> FSA sent this.<eos> Here are a hit.<eos> Zanko Zajkovs wife.<eos> I have checked it there on the net.
Even someone who doesn't care about others can see the difference.<eos> What is wrong with her?<eos> Did she get traumatized from yesterday or something?<eos> Oh, oh.<eos> You know those things on TV shows.<eos> People with many personalities.<eos> - Dissociative identity disorder.<eos> - Yes, dissociative identity disorder.<eos> Maybe she has that?<eos> And we didn't know about it until now?
- Why's that?<eos> - What do you mean, why?<eos> He's number one on the search right now, something about assault.<eos> You ought to know.<eos> Look into it.<eos> - Assault?<eos> - Hold on.<eos> Yes, Reporter.<eos> That article is not true.<eos> It's not true so why would I address it?
No matter how much wrong I did, I'm your mother.<eos> This is why everyone says you're rude with no manners. You know that?<eos> - Hello!<eos> - Hello, Professor.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Not my boyfriend!<eos> He's my son.<eos> I told you to carry that talisman, didn't I?<eos> Your fortune this year is rough.<eos> Didn't I tell you to carry it around?
Chef, Chef!<eos> - Chef, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry!<eos> - What the heck were you doing!<eos> Oh, forget it.<eos> The shoot ended well.<eos> Gosh...<eos> But, I think Bong Sun will have to continue doing the show.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> I'm supposed to do it.
What makes you so certain that Niklaus would select Lucien over his own family?<eos> From what I hear, he tortured his friend Marcel, cursed the mother of his child, and burned your paramour in front of you, all because he thought it the logical way to defeat his enemy.<eos> With Lucien in his ear, how long before the logical thing is to get rid of you?<eos> Well, how very fortunate, indeed, then, Niklaus is on his way right now to put Lucien out of our collective misery.<eos> You have to stop him.<eos> And why would I do that?<eos> Lucien's seer believes there's an object capable of killing you.<eos> I'm well aware.<eos> Well, I don't have it.<eos> I'm quite certain my sister doesn't have it, either.

What about this. What if...<eos> The ring just accidentally disappears.<eos> - Accidentally?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Just put it on the counter, and I'll handle the rest.<eos> Oh my God, Tucker, you're a genius.<eos> I know.<eos> I'll say that I was doing the dishes.<eos> Or something more believable?<eos> Just turn around and you'll never see it again.

Not when you got all this.<eos> Right? Mm-hmm.<eos> Knuckles. Give it. Boo.<eos> - Hey hey hey.<eos> - Oh, hi. Hey.<eos> Are my two favorite girls ready to get some lunch?<eos> - Where is your ring? - Oh, uh...<eos> - Yeah, um... my ring...<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> You didn't lose it?
Oh, my God. You want me to marry you.<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, I will marry you.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> I'm just dating you until Steve and Marcy break up.<eos> - Hey, Steve.<eos> - No.<eos> Mrs. Wheeler, look!<eos> I found your ring!<eos> Told you we'd get it back without Brad finding out.
Okay.<eos> Party's over.<eos> Time to go home.<eos> Don't stay out too late.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I love these sconces so much.<eos> Hey!<eos> Boss the Ross.<eos> Oh, hey, have you seen my apartment?<eos> 'Cause I can't find it anywhere.
- I just do.<eos> Is there anything i can do to make you feel better?<eos> Just be my friend?<eos> Right.<eos> You got it.<eos> Brad...<eos> You have to forgive me.<eos> I had no idea how much the ring meant to you.<eos> Bonnie, I didn't just meet you.<eos> - I knew you hated it.
Just be my friend?<eos> Right.<eos> You got it.<eos> Brad...<eos> You have to forgive me.<eos> I had no idea how much the ring meant to you.<eos> Bonnie, I didn't just meet you.<eos> - I knew you hated it.<eos> - Okay, but I don't anymore.<eos> And I swear that i will never ever for any reason ever take it off again.

Don't believe me, believe the prophecy.<eos> If not you, whom?<eos> Just make up your mind.<eos> I've gotta leave before sunrise.<eos> El Rey, huh?<eos> How much is that gonna cost you?<eos> Oh, some sweat and tears, but mostly blood.<eos> A lot of blood.<eos> Once we empty that well, a thousand souls will cry out and the gods will be appeased.<eos> But you can't let Carlos take it.
He's a nice kid.<eos> He's way too cool for Mom, but, yeah, he's a pretty special guy.<eos> Yeah, I remember the Coldman case.<eos> It was brutal.<eos> He was your first, right?<eos> Third.<eos> His parents had been dead almost a week when we found him.<eos> Seemed to have bounced back pretty good though.<eos> Seems that way.<eos> A lot of times though with childhood trauma, they bury it so deep inside it's like it never happened.
(whistling) No, no, Dagur, don't!<eos> I'm the one that gave you the key.<eos> Which makes you traitor.<eos> I hate traitors.<eos> It's a new day, Hiccup.<eos> (laughs) Hope you're well rested.<eos> Okay, bud, let's try the new move.<eos> Ah-hooo!<eos> Yeah, baby!<eos> That's it, Toothless! Push it.
He has a point. We can't wait around here forever.<eos> We can't just leave Johann's treasures here either.<eos> Dagur will steal them.<eos> And use the profits to build a new armada.<eos> Not if we steal them first.<eos> That is the dumbest idea I've ever heard.<eos> I hereby disown you!<eos> Actually, you know what? I sort of like it.<eos> Welcome back to the family.<eos> Here's the plan: we search the ships, gather up Johann's treasure, and take it back to Berk.
Is this how you people get your kicks, killing each other for sport?<eos> Take your hand off me, or I will tear your arm from its socket.<eos> What I built in this city might seem small to you, but at least my guys have rules.<eos> We don't kill each other, simple code, begins with loyalty, something you clearly don't give a damn about.<eos> Uh!<eos> Death is inevitable, even for those such as we.<eos> Acknowledging that makes even the longest of lives all the more intoxicating.<eos> Mm...<eos> A fine effort, Marcel, but I don't have your daylight ring.<eos> I do hope you're able to find it, though, what little time remains.
Makes you regret turning any vampires in the first place.<eos> Well, the division of labor seems crystal clear... two of them, two of u... us.<eos> "Roses are red.<eos> Lavender is blue.<eos> Come find me before I find you."<eos> I remember her a better poet.<eos> Oh, I wouldn't say that this is lacking in poetry.<eos> She wants us to find her, so let's.<eos> You're so eager, Niklaus.<eos> Last time you even said her name was a thousand years ago when you told me never to speak it again in your presence.
How lovely.<eos> I'd like to thank the Gentilly coven for their generous gift on this day of Fete de Kado.<eos> I apologize.<eos> I need a minute.<eos> Not a fan of goats, huh?<eos> I love goats, but do you know how many of them I've had to sacrifice?<eos> Just once, I'd like to get a gift card.<eos> I mean, I know this is all tradition, but it's just not me, and you know what I really hate?<eos> That choker scarf?<eos> This choker scarf, and I only wore it because Josephine did and I thought that maybe if I were more like her, then... then maybe they would respect me.
It's up to me to record his life story.<eos> When pops dies, what happens to all his stuff?<eos> They'll probably just throw it all away.<eos> You know our parents are animals.<eos> They can't do that.<eos> - I know.<eos> The '70s are coming back strong.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I get the brown hat.<eos> Not if I get it first.
- Everything's fine. - Okay.<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> I'll have the damn operation.<eos> But not because of you.<eos> I'll let one of them quacks cut me open.<eos> Oh, they actually don't cut you open.<eos> They just make a little small incision in your groin, and then they have a-a metal tube...<eos> Yeah, but he... he... he said he'll have it.<eos> - That they feed all the way up<eos> - He... he said he'll have it.
Least I can do.<eos> Get some rest, now. Wow.<eos> That was nice.<eos> Yeah, sure was, wasn't it? Mm-hmm. Heifer stole my Vicodin!<eos> - Mama!<eos> - What you talking about "mama"?<eos> You tried to steal my damn pudding.<eos> Well, hell, I didn't want that cold chicken.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'mma eat it.
I don't judge you for your frequent bathroom visits.<eos> Even number one has to go number two.<eos> [Laughs] I like that.<eos> [Laughs] Boom! - I can't wait for your cousins to beat your ass.<eos> - No.<eos> - What?<eos> - Junior, I would really appreciate it if you and your cousins would refrain from roughhousing.<eos> Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. - Don't listen to her, all right?<eos> - [Scoffs] Roughhousing is a normal, necessary part of growing up, all right?<eos> Me and my cousin June Bug, we went at it all the time.
Hair.<eos> Everybody has it somewhere.
But what's up with you, baby girl?"<eos> Baby girl.<eos> I can do that.<eos> Now, is "who dis" with one "s" or two?<eos> There you are, T.<eos> Bron-Bron's over here looking for you to fix him up.<eos> What did you do to your hair?<eos> What did you do to my hair, huh?<eos> What, me?<eos> You must've messed with it at home.
Now, get to it! A merry...<eos> Christmas.<eos> Uh Oh.<eos> - A 6. - What's wrong?<eos> Nothing. Except I kind of asked for a 6s, but it's cool.<eos> I mean, how are you supposed to know?<eos> Except for the part where I wrote it down for you, but...<eos> I can't believe this!<eos> And what is wrong with you? ! I disappeared myself for a gift card to J.Crew?<eos> ! You took money I could use every place and turned it into money I could use one place.
- For he's a jolly good savior - I'll walk... why are you running?<eos> Who nobody can renounce<eos> Come on! who nobody can renounce<eos> Who nobody can renounce<eos> For he's... All right, Pops, what's up?<eos> I hate church's chicken.<eos> What?<eos> Don't get me wrong.<eos> It's chicken. It's fried in delicious batter, but I hate it.<eos> Then why did you talk it up every year and make it our Christmas tradition?
I think that bitch may have killed my soul mate.<eos> You know, Dre, you think I can hold a little something, man?<eos> I got to get a new canvas, you know?<eos> Yeah, for sure.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Let me see what I got.<eos> Yeah, a little. Just a canvas?<eos> I got that.<eos> Take that one.<eos> You'll get it right back.
So... This notebook...<eos> Indeed. When he is in the hands of an assassin like you.<eos> This will be interesting!<eos> Stop!<eos> You can use this notebook as you see fit!<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait!<eos> In that case...<eos> What is the return?<eos> You've already paid for it.
I've been at parties where humans have held bottles, pencils, thermoses in front of themselves and called out,<eos> "Hey, look at me.<eos> I'm Mr. So-And-So-Dick.<eos> I've got such-and-such for a penis."<eos> I never saw it fail to get a laugh.<eos> All right!<eos> That's enough!<eos> You guys are talking about my species.<eos> We understand genocide.<eos> We do it sometimes.
- Scalpel. - Scalpel.<eos> - Nano-Doctor.<eos> - Nano-Doctor.<eos> - Nano-Scalpel. - Nano-Scalpel. Okay.<eos> We're ready.<eos> Not so fast!<eos> Mr. Smith? What are you doing?<eos> Are you insane?<eos> !<eos> I'm a good person, and I demand that you cut off my penis and put it in that man's chest.
That's a good script.<eos> What the hell? !<eos> I don't care. I want you out.<eos> -What?<eos> -Take that thing down.<eos> Your grandson is a shitty person.<eos> Leave now.<eos> -Morty!<eos> -Rick, I didn't do anything.<eos> I sat through his entire screenplay -- you "sat through it"?
- He's got a good heart... when he's Jekyll.<eos> - And when he's Hyde?<eos> I can't imagine what it would be like to have that power.<eos> Knowing you're invulnerable.<eos> All the gods go mad.<eos> - Can't anything hurt him?<eos> - Nothing physical.<eos> Bella?<eos> Beer delivery in the back yard.<eos> They need you to sign for it.
What do you think they'd do to the whole bloody world, Hyde?<eos> We are on the side of the angels.<eos> When the angels behave as badly as the demons, there's no hope for any of us.<eos> Hir yw'r dydd a hir yw'r nos, a hir yw aros Arawn.<eos> What do you think we've been working for all these years?<eos> To wake Lord Trash.<eos> You had the means to do it.<eos> You had the power of the demon.<eos> And you threw it... away.<eos> I didn't throw it away.

The Jezequiels and the Jekylls are the same family.<eos> Olalla, no.<eos> You don't know what you're offering.<eos> What it would mean.<eos> You're dying, Renata, and the seal has been cracked.<eos> Let me be the new Gatekeeper.<eos> Is that why you stayed?<eos> You need to tell me everything, though, before it's too late.<eos> Hidden inside the book is another book, as you've discovered.<eos> When I realised we were under threat I gave it to your brother to take away, but it made its way back here.
Tuesday.<eos> Okay, I'll remember that shit.<eos> Tuesday."<eos> Being the youngest, you don't get no college fund.<eos> My brothers and sisters messed that all up.<eos> I asked my dad about college, he was like, "Shit.<eos> You better find something to do.<eos> Talk to your brothers and sisters.<eos> They had your college fund.<eos> They messed it up."
"Shit."<eos> I didn't know none of their plays.<eos> I was like, "Shit.<eos> Coach, game almost over--"<eos> - "Get in the game!" - "What--"<eos> I got out there, I ain't care, I said, "Okay, shit, I'll go out there."<eos> Quarterback say he's running with--<eos> In the huddle, he said we gonna run, run the ball.<eos> They gonna run the ball.<eos> I said, "He ain't gonna throw it to me, so I'm gonna have some fun."
We don't know each other at all.<eos> - Maybe we should take a step back and...<eos> - BoJack, watch out!<eos> - Aah! - Oh, no!<eos> - What was that?<eos> - A stick?<eos> Tree branch?<eos> Nothing?<eos> I heard someone scream, "Oh, no."<eos> Yeah, that's the sound a stick makes when you hit it with your car.
How can anyone know what anything means?<eos> The answer is nobody can. Nothing means anything.<eos> So why bother talking about anything?<eos> In this scenario, are Mr. Peanutbutter and I living in our house? Or are we squatting in an abandoned Barnes Noble burning books to keep warm as we struggle through our Dickensian-style poverty?<eos> "Zero, zero, zero." No idea what that means.<eos> I think it means "call me."<eos> Ignore.<eos> Wait, where's the ignore button?<eos> How do I ignore?<eos> I think with a beeper, you just ignore it.
- Uh, fine?<eos> - Correct.<eos> - Did you see the game last night?<eos> - No, I don't follow... Oh.<eos> Oh, so sorry.<eos> It says here you did see the game.<eos> - What game?<eos> - Ready camera one?<eos> Camera one. You tell me.<eos> You're the one who saw it.
Hello, Diane.<eos> Thank you, Nicole.<eos> Prince Gustav today startled the international community when he gave his royal fortune to charity. What?<eos> Oh, no!<eos> And fired his chief advisor, who can be seen in this file photo looking vaguely suspicious.<eos> Oh, you idiot!<eos> No!<eos> Big reforms which could lead to sweeping change in the embattled region, or a precipitous economic collapse.<eos> But back to our main story, what is Diane's problem?<eos> I'll say it once, for your article.
You wanna watch another episode of Horsin' Around?<eos> Where Olivia does the school project where she pretends an egg is a baby.<eos> Spoiler alert: Ethan needs to make an omelet.<eos> Why won't you go home?<eos> I should. I know I should.<eos> I wish I could just go home right now and crawl into bed and not have to talk about anything or explain anything.<eos> He would just say, "How was your day?" And then he would say,<eos> "Hey, did you know the monorail was invented by George Monorail?"<eos> And I would say, "I don't think that's true."<eos> And he would say, "Well, if he didn't invent it, he certainly perfected it."
- What are you drinking? - Nothing.<eos> - Hand it over.<eos> - Fine. Ugh.<eos> Red Bull and vodka?<eos> What are you, 12?<eos> You'll get sick drinking all that sugar.<eos> Do they teach you anything in school?<eos> Make a left at the light.<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> - I'll get you some bourbon. And you'll cut it with water.
I feel like I have bone in my teeth.<eos> It's like something is tickling me behind the ears.<eos> Get it?<eos> Lord Beerus...<eos> What should I do with the dinosaur meat?<eos> I don't want it anymore.<eos> I don't think it will be as good as I imagined...<eos> Elder Kai, what's going on?<eos> You don't like the tea?<eos> So you didn't feel it?
Notice, I didn't say "sorry."<eos> "Excuse me" is just about as bad.<eos> Good job with the Smulder case.<eos> Thanks. Are you following me?<eos> No.<eos> You just happen to be at this bar?<eos> Okay, I followed you from court.<eos> She is really good.<eos> So, why'd you give me the case?<eos> What makes you think I gave it to you?
Look, just because your son scored a bag of what appears to be Blue Dragon Ultimate Kush doesn't mean he's on a path to Satan.<eos> It's not just that.<eos> I came home and found him having relations with...<eos> A girl?<eos> A woman?<eos> Boy?<eos> Cantaloupe.<eos> [laughing] Cantaloupe?<eos> I'm... I'm sorry, how does one...<eos> He said if you bore a hole in the fruit, and put it in the microwave, it provides a sensation of being with a woman.
Uh, he has something to say to you. You tell everyone you're a pastor?<eos> But I know what you really are.<eos> You're a psychic.<eos> I mean, how else could you know?<eos> - Know?<eos> - That Isabella and I were fighting over when to have a baby.<eos> That's what you meant by giving us that Bible passage, right?<eos> That the time is now?<eos> So you got that, huh?<eos> - [doorbell rings] - Ooh, I'll get it.
He's gonna keep coming for me.<eos> He's gonna keep kidnapping people like you, forcing them to do what he wants.<eos> I have to stop him before more people die.<eos> - You can't stop Zoom.<eos> - Yes, I can.<eos> I will, but I need your help.<eos> Zoom wants Doctor Light to send him your new emblem.<eos> Yes.<eos> We need it for bait.<eos> If we can get Doctor Light to take my emblem, throw it through the breach, then Zoom will come to collect my body, and we can trap him.
You better get on with it, son.<eos> Please, don't.<eos> Stop it.<eos> The material that you took from Anika was the result of months of hard work and great financial expense.<eos> And by material, you mean this drug you've been manufacturing.<eos> Well, it's not recognized as a narcotic by the FDA.<eos> It's perfectly legal.<eos> Or a loophole since you made some designer tweaks to it.<eos> The point is, it belonged to me and it was stolen.<eos> You have it and I want it back.
See, I was saving her, but seeing as you're a gentleman and all...<eos> - But, Bill, you said...<eos> - Shut your hole!<eos> He's a gentleman, isn't he?<eos> So... what do you say?<eos> How do, sir?<eos> You're the first.<eos> Go on.<eos> Inside.<eos> That dress, where did you get it?
Go on.<eos> Inside.<eos> That dress, where did you get it?<eos> Why?<eos> I'm looking for this girl, Alice.<eos> She had one just like it.<eos> What of it?<eos> Thought you might have seen her.<eos> No.<eos> Where did you get it?
- I feared something like this.<eos> - What's happened?<eos> I'm quite all right, I promise.<eos> I strained myself during an experiment.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Really?<eos> I wanted to give you your wedding gift.<eos> Couldn't it wait till tomorrow?<eos> Why not?<eos> You'll understand when you see it.
So, keep trying new things.<eos> See what your body remembers.<eos> Or make new choices.<eos> The more you make, the less helpless you'll feel.<eos> Even if nothing ever comes back, you can still find yourself.<eos> That one's odd.<eos> - That square on her shoulder.<eos> - Yeah, I was eyeing that too because everything else is so ornate.<eos> - That is opaque.<eos> - If Jane had a tattoo before our unsub drugged her and did the rest, they'd have to cover it up.
A horse?<eos> Your Highness!<eos> You really don't know?<eos> Or a palanquin?<eos> One last chance, what is your answer?<eos> It's a boat!<eos> It normally floats, but sinks in harsh waters.<eos> I shall ride you, you're my boat today!<eos> Unfortunately, you're wrong.<eos> It keeps a boat afloat or sinks it.
Your magic has no power here.<eos> Only our witch can cast spells.<eos> How tragic, that you and your sister must say your farewells like this.<eos> I can't decide.<eos> Should I make you watch as she screams for mercy or leave you wondering just how badly she suffered?<eos> If you hurt her, I will rip your l... unh!<eos> You lured me all this way, and the whole time, it was a lie.<eos> Not at all.<eos> The spell is very real.<eos> I wanted to enjoy the look on your face when I took it from you.
I'll tell you everything I know.<eos> I suggest you speak quickly.<eos> There is a weapon in play, a dangerous, cursed device called The Serratura.<eos> It is capable of producing an unbreakable boundary.<eos> My brother and Lucien want to use it to lock you and your siblings away forever so that no one may harm you, but to do so, they need all 3 of you in one place.<eos> Which is why they sent a legion of Strix to collect my sister.<eos> But not to worry, my love.<eos> I took measures to ensure that Rebekah isn't held by those nasty Strix for long.<eos> What measures?<eos> While they did acquire Rebekah's body, I wasn't about to let them keep it, so I enacted a plan of my own.
A contract that explicitly states that any product Alyssa Lang developed during her employment Is the property of our client.<eos> Unfortunately that contract is unenforceable.<eos> It is unless I woke up in russia this morning.<eos> Your honor, I have here a copy Of Alyssa Lang's birth certificate.<eos> She may have signed that contract, But it isn't binding because she was only 16 at the time.<eos> What?<eos> Your honor, I know this man, And that document could have come from anywhere.<eos> Get it verified by the labs at Quantico.<eos> All it's gonna prove is that Alyssa Lang Had no legal capacity to sign.<eos> It doesn't matter how old she was when she signed it. It was ten years ago.
To convince you that you'll get away with it, you won't. There's nothing in that complaint That isn't factually correct.<eos> You are twisting those facts and you could ruin a man's life, And you know it.<eos> Oh, and how is that different from what he's doing to me?<eos> - It's completely different.<eos> - Is it?<eos> I worked for that man 60 hours a week for 10 years, And now that I want to start my own company, He not only wants to crush me,<eos> But he told people I stole the idea. If that's not ruining a person's life, then I don't know what is.<eos> Oh, and as far as Travis Tanner goes, Sexual harassment wasn't his idea.<eos> It was mine.<eos> And when he tried to talk me out of it, I told him he could either get on board Or watch me get another lawyer.
I got you the special.<eos> Did you say no pickles?<eos> You didn't say no pickles.<eos> I didn't say, "order my lunch."<eos> So sue me.<eos> You send the notification over to Tanner?<eos> Two hours ago.<eos> Then it won't be long.<eos> What?<eos> I didn't say anything about your state of mind after Tim Petroff Because I wasn't worried about it then,
I...<eos> Am sorry, Jack. I had to come clean.<eos> - It was the right thing to do.<eos> - You lying piece of shit. Watch it, Jack.<eos> You're talking to a name partner.<eos> And you're saying that he's lying, But as head of the compensation committee, You had access to Harvey's salary.<eos> I didn't leave that document out and I can prove it.<eos> - How is that? - I know for a fact that...<eos> Oh, let me help you out.<eos> The reason you stopped yourself Is that you were going to say Louis left it out.
I got it. So what's the drill?<eos> I'm doing this, not you.<eos> No deal.<eos> It's my cash, my job.<eos> That's non-negotiable.<eos> We'll be waiting right outside.<eos> We keep the money in your coat.<eos> Check it when you go inside the club.<eos> Have yourself a drink.<eos> When you leave, the coat checker hands it back to you with the film inside the lining.
Ok, maybe you need something to get your mind off all this.<eos> I got a little side project, clear your head.<eos> Like gambling?<eos> I need a full work-up.<eos> It's possible it's made out of some sort of bio-organic material.<eos> I need to know everything that you can find out about it.<eos> Hmm, strange. Hmm?<eos> These edges.<eos> Doesn't look mass-manufactured.<eos> Where'd you find it?
Come on, baby.<eos> Time to move.<eos> Time to run.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Nina, it's me.<eos> When's the next InterCity to Copenhagen?<eos> Hold on a second.<eos> 2:26 PM.<eos> Book me a first-class ticket.<eos> I'll pick it up at the station.
I got the mail.<eos> Hey, does an octopus live here?<eos> Peter, that says "occupant."<eos> Oh, that's too bad.<eos> That would've been awesome.<eos> Oh look, Peter.<eos> Here's something from your mother's estate.<eos> Oh, looks like they finally sold her house.<eos> And the last white domino in that neighborhood falls.<eos> Wow, they sold it?

You guys are my everything.<eos> Why'd you ever marry him?<eos> Believe it or not, he used to look like a young Gene Hackman.<eos> That's... that-that's not even good.<eos> It's gone!<eos> What? What's gone?<eos> Our drinking couch!<eos> Somebody must've stole it!<eos> You left a couch out on the curb?<eos> Well, somebody probably thought it was trash and took it.
Whoo, we did it!<eos> We found almost the exact same dress at the bridal store.<eos> It's white, it's poofy, it's perfect.<eos> Oh, here she comes!<eos> Everybody look nonchalant!<eos> All right, I need help picking the cake, and I thought you guys...<eos> - Aah! - Oh, my God!<eos> Oh my God, mom!<eos> - No! - Oh...<eos> But we took such perfect care of it!
This I gonna be the best wedding story ever.<eos> I'd still like to get out of these.<eos> - Let me get a picture first.<eos> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Oh, all right.<eos> Maybe they really are meant to be.<eos> Told you.<eos> Hey, you guys look familiar.<eos> Were you the ones trying to steal my dolphin?<eos> That's where we saw it!
That's right.<eos> We can't beat them with brute force, remember?<eos> Scalpels, surgical precision.<eos> We're small enough, they won't see us coming.<eos> I hope.<eos> Gear up.<eos> Ship's on autopilot.<eos> Course can be tracked via our HUD.<eos> You heard this plan?<eos> And we're still doing it?
Kate, why are you shutting me out?<eos> Castle, I love you.<eos> Kate.<eos> Kate.<eos> Beckett.<eos> Are you sure we're safe here?<eos> Am I sure?<eos> Um, no.<eos> This building was seized by NYPD a week ago in a drug bust.<eos> There's no paperwork connecting it to me.
- What? !<eos> Get in the car!<eos> Oh, God.<eos> - I think I'm gonna hurl.<eos> - Just try to keep it together.<eos> Oh, I'm definitely gonna hurl.<eos> What the hell are you doing? !<eos> How do you think they found us?<eos> They tapped your phone.<eos> They used it to track you to me.
Kang Yoon-gu.<eos> It's their loss!<eos> Fine, let's see how far it will go.<eos> CONVERSATION OF DREAMS<eos> Please leave a message after the beep...<eos> THE WORST SCUM<eos> Who are you?<eos> Where did you put the dead body?<eos> - The dead body?<eos> - Where did you put it?
Noah?<eos> Noah?<eos> Joe, what's wrong?<eos> Noah brought that board back in the house, do you know where he is?<eos> I think he went for a walk down the hill.<eos> Noah! What is wrong with you?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> You know what you did.<eos> You took the Ouija board out of the trash and you brought it back in the house. No I didn't.
Bev was telling me about that night when you were younger?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All I remember is my father drowning me in a bathtub<eos> Although it wasn't me.<eos> I was seeing through someone else's eyes.<eos> In fact, all of that just came back to me when I touched that board.<eos> What board?<eos> The Ouija board.<eos> You have a Ouija board back at the house?<eos> Has anyone else used it?
Beverly?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You can't save her, just like you couldn't save your wife.<eos> That's where you're wrong.<eos> Heart will befall you.<eos> Heart will befall all of you. Noah.<eos> Noah isn't here, only Belial.<eos> Sorry, the book wasn't working fast enough.<eos> It's not working, Ronnie.<eos> Fight it to hold on, the harder you try it more it tears Noah apart before it moves on to you.
[Tires squealing]<eos> [Canary cry]<eos> [Tires squealing]<eos> The Ghosts, they're about to knocking over the armored cars.<eos> Yeah, it's just like old times.<eos> [Grunting]<eos> There are guards in the back.<eos> We'll get 'em. Go!<eos> They burned all the money.<eos> They didn't need it.
Only that the deterioration of the DNA markers was most definitely not natural.<eos> Which means it was caused by what?<eos> Curtis and I have been trying to figure that out for the past month.<eos> Maybe Ray will have better luck.<eos> I will ask.<eos> Hey, you got a sec?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where'd you get this?<eos> I got that from Lance.<eos> Who got it from Damien Darhk.
Very nice to meet you. Curtis.<eos> Oliver.<eos> How long have you two been married?<eos> 5 years right about now.<eos> Oh, a winter wedding.<eos> It must have been beautiful.<eos> It was the summer, actually.<eos> We got married on a scuba diving boat near the Great Barrier Reef.<eos> I hid the ring in a seashell at the bottom of the reef.<eos> And you are lucky I found it.

- Best of both worlds?<eos> - I like that.<eos> You good, Harry?<eos> Yeah, why wouldn't I be?<eos> Holiday blues?<eos> It can't be easy knowing Zoom still has his daughter.<eos> Yeah, all right, look, I'll be right back.<eos> I have something I have to deal with.<eos> Hey.<eos> Okay, the last time the two of you were looking at me like that, it was when you both took my convertible on a joy ride and wrapped it around that big oak tree on Fairmont Drive.
Confess here and now like a man.<eos> Who took the money?<eos> It was not us.<eos> To think of all the work your mother has put into grooming you to be proper young men of society.<eos> Do you really want to put her through the heartache of thinking she is a complete and utter failure?<eos> No.<eos> Then what would a man do?<eos> He would tell the truth.<eos> And the truth is?<eos> I took it.
1,000 years could pass, I would never forget that spell.<eos> There's not a day goes by I don't think about those words.<eos> Why do you know so much about this?<eos> Like you care.<eos> I mean, it's not like you believe anything I say.<eos> I'm willing to believe you.<eos> Ok?<eos> I need you to be 100% honest with me, please.<eos> How do you know so much about this spell?<eos> Because I've used it.
I find your lack of white bread disturbing.<eos> - But I have sourdough. - Yippee!<eos> We didn't know we were about to meet a queen and two Jedi who didn't know that they were about to meet a terrible fate.<eos> Master Qui-Gon, that was some negotiation.<eos> The Trade Federation Viceroys attacked us, and now we're on the run.<eos> All that matters now is breaking through this blockade so Queen Amidala won't be forced to sign that treaty.<eos> Can you tell me why again?<eos> - Even I'm not 100% sure. - Uh, well, uh... I know it!<eos> The shield generator's been hit.<eos> I'll send the droids to fix it.
Victor might bought cocaine by the Minosevic and he was obliged him with.<eos> Why take on a murder investigation for pennies?<eos> The Cover to the arm-chair.<eos> None of the the kids have said something about Carléns house.<eos> -maybe It was someone else.<eos> -Someone who didn't know the Victor?<eos> Or coated nothing with the case to make.<eos> Though it was found at the crime scene?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> But you, we will not solve it in the evening.
If you spend time with you, it is impossible not to think about you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How happy I was that you came by.<eos> -It was nice.<eos> Thanks for the beer.<eos> You get the health of the family.<eos> -I will do that.<eos> You should have baptism?<eos> -Yes, we are indeed.<eos> Pernilla wanted it.
I'll be thinking about it all night.<eos> Uh... come on in, Mr. President!<eos> And then, so I'm like, "Peter, how was I supposed to know you didn't want your teammates to know you wore a bra?"<eos> It was a custom-designed sports halter top.<eos> More stories!<eos> More stories!<eos> Hey, tell one where Peter is a nincompoop or maybe a Silly Billy.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Okay, let's just carve the turkey.<eos> Oh, Aunt Karen already carved it.
Hey, tell one where Peter is a nincompoop or maybe a Silly Billy.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Okay, let's just carve the turkey.<eos> Oh, Aunt Karen already carved it.<eos> She did?<eos> But that's my thing.<eos> I always do my "are you a leg man or a breast man" joke.<eos> Aunt Karen did that, too.<eos> It was hilarious.<eos> I never really got it until she said it.
You're awesome.<eos> Know what else is awesome?<eos> This stuffing.<eos> Thank you, Glenn.<eos> You're welcome. I'm in a good mood.<eos> Sure, what the hell, I'll show you my moves.<eos> Maybe after dinner.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> The family football game is after dinner.<eos> We do it every year!
I've had a vasectomy.<eos> Chris, now that I'm a toothpick guy, it's my job to sit on a BMX bike outside the rec center and ask every kid if they're the new kid.<eos> Hey. You the new kid?<eos> Why?<eos> Never mind why.<eos> Got any cool toys?<eos> Uh, I got an Xbox.<eos> How about you?<eos> I got a Barbie with a wiener on it.<eos> Took a thumb from a G.I. Joe, put it on with superglue.
It's all good.<eos> What's the freshest?<eos> It's all fresh.<eos> How 'bout the halibut?<eos> Is it gamey?<eos> Gamey?<eos> I mean, you know, is it fishy?<eos> It's all fish.<eos> Is there a special way to prepare it?<eos> I'd cook it up.
Huh?<eos> Who?<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, what?<eos> What?<eos> Which doggy in what window?<eos> So, how'd everything go?<eos> Hard to tell.<eos> I was coughing the whole time.<eos> By the way, I couldn't figure out how to use your oven, so I destroyed it in a blind rage.
I don't know, I think you're making too big a deal out of this.<eos> Too big a deal? !<eos> The guy's been sitting next to me all these years, acting like he's my friend, when all he really wants is to be with my wife!<eos> Geez, calm down.<eos> No, I'm telling you, he's gonna try to take Lois away from me.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm going over there right now and hit him with a shovel, like a white trash YouTube girl.<eos> Peter, wait, wait.<eos> Listen.<eos> Delete that message and pretend you never heard it.
Geez, calm down.<eos> No, I'm telling you, he's gonna try to take Lois away from me.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm going over there right now and hit him with a shovel, like a white trash YouTube girl.<eos> Peter, wait, wait.<eos> Listen.<eos> Delete that message and pretend you never heard it.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> Because you weren't meant to hear it.
Mostly.<eos> But...<eos> I just found out about this habit he has.<eos> And I'm trying to figure out if I can...<eos> Handle it or not.<eos> Habit?<eos> You mean like he smokes?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's a smoker.<eos> But I think he realizes it's bad for him, but... he needs it.
He could still be here!<eos> - Let's go!<eos> Time to put the camera away!<eos> - Come on, man!<eos> - Diver, go!<eos> - Let's go!<eos> Come on!<eos> So, no one saw anything suspicious.<eos> No single men on their own.<eos> And the book, did we find it?
Our killer's favorite little calling card.<eos> If it's important to our killer, it's important to us, which is where Graham comes in.<eos> Now, look, Graham Walker is shrewd, all right?<eos> He's controlling.<eos> And he wouldn't want people to think he's playing nice with the cops without a fight.<eos> Rather than haul his ass in, we're gonna get an invitation to his house.<eos> We've got locations and times for every cash drop he's got tonight.<eos> - We hit each spot.<eos> - Grab the cash.<eos> And then we let them know if they want their money back, we'll deliver it to Graham in person.
- It's done.<eos> Uh, no. I got nothing there yet, and I got no paper on Cooper Flynn.<eos> They say the birth certificates... they're all in boxes at the county clerk's.<eos> That could take weeks.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Roth.<eos> Go.<eos> Hey, look, Jack. I've been at it all night.<eos> No one's tried to crush up a messed up vintage car.<eos> Besides, guys here tell me they wouldn't destroy it anyway.

Besides, guys here tell me they wouldn't destroy it anyway.<eos> They'd fix it and they'd sell it.<eos> Okay. What's next?<eos> Well, me telling you how he does it.<eos> I think I figured it out.<eos> All right, so after the Slayer kills these women, obviously he's leaving one hell of a mess.<eos> So if he's not junking the cars, he must be repairing them.<eos> So what if he does that for a living?<eos> He's a car restorer.<eos> Takes the customer's car... uses it for the kill.

Stealing the computers may have just been a way to throw everyone off the scent.<eos> I'd rather not present a theory of the crime<eos> I do not believe.<eos> Simple stories sell.<eos> You've been reading too much propaganda theory.<eos> I do not wish to bamboozle the FBI into pursuing Mr. Antonov-- I want to question him myself.<eos> And if he fits, present a complete thesis of his true motive.<eos> This is a man who blogs as Henry IX, who advocates for the restoration of a Tudor-style monarchy in the 21st century.<eos> Yeah, but being a kook doesn't make him less likely to be a killer.<eos> My point is that if Antonov did do it, it might not be because he grew to hate his ex-wife, but because he was still in love with her work.
I mean, what would your followers think if they realized you suckled at government's teat?<eos> Look, you have the wrong idea.<eos> No one would have killed Gail for that algorithm.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> And you know that how?<eos> Well... she never changed her password.<eos> I would... check on her sometimes.<eos> We had 11 good years, and I missed her.<eos> Gail was disappointed with the program, obviously, but... well, she was nervous, too.<eos> She wasn't sure at all how her patron would take it.
He taught me everything I know about shooting...<eos> Said to me, "lass, if you remember what you're fighting for, you will never miss your target."<eos> Well, it looks like it was good advice.<eos> Aye.<eos> Now, is my potion done?<eos> Yeah, a-about that, do you know what this potion will do to you?<eos> Think I would ask you to make it if I didn't?<eos> But it'll turn you into a... a bear.<eos> No, it changes fate is what it does.<eos> The spell of Mor'du, they call it.

It would be a shame to cut that lifetime short.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> Perhaps a charity.<eos> Or one of those bum buffets.<eos> I think the term is "soup kitchen", Your Majesty.<eos> Soup kitchen!<eos> Lucius, have the press meet us at a soup kitchen.<eos> Let's see if we can't generate a little goodwill. Hm.<eos> Len.<eos> Put your phone away, you're missing it.
If you do happen to see my mother, you could tell her that the mayor may have pardoned her, but I haven't.<eos> She comes anywhere near me or my son, I'll kill her.<eos> I brought you some food from the market.<eos> I'm afraid I don't have much of an appetite. Hmm. Were you able to make contact with Alak?<eos> He did not have kind words for you.<eos> As expected.<eos> Was he well?<eos> Well enough to attend the funeral of your husband.<eos> There was a funeral?<eos> Did Alak organize it?
Dying in the service of others is not the end I would have expected for my husband.<eos> It is possible he did it for you.<eos> How so?<eos> Datak secured a pardon as a condition of his sacrifice.<eos> You are free to return home. Hmm. You okay?<eos> That was Indur who walked out, Zero's father.<eos> And that's what's left of Zero's rifle?<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Figure his old man should have it.<eos> I'll bring it to him.
It keeps you shape-takers docile.<eos> I won't let you.<eos> - Yes, you will.<eos> - No, I mean it.<eos> You'll have to kill me.<eos> No.<eos> Your will to live is much too strong.<eos> - Show me your neck.<eos> - No.<eos> If you don't, I'll snap it.
Mom, please.<eos> As the wise man said, what you don't know can't hurt you.<eos> - I think it's a little late for that.<eos> - Yeah, well, there's no need to dig deeper, not just now.<eos> You know, I never got that saying. If you don't know that getting hit by a bus hurts, then you can play in traffic without fear, but it doesn't mean you're not gonna get slammed.<eos> That's a bit literal.<eos> You know what the original saying was:<eos> British writer, George Pettie, 1500s.<eos> And you know this how?<eos> Well, I had an idle moment, once, and I looked it up, and I agree.
I told him she was dead.<eos> What'd he say?<eos> He said for me to keep the phone.<eos> I'll run the last number, see what I can find.<eos> Any of them get away?<eos> Yeah, one.<eos> Up those stairs, out the back.<eos> There was a truck waiting for 'em.<eos> Old Blazer, black, silver, jacked up...<eos> Where'd you see it?
Anything on prints yet?<eos> Still processing.<eos> I think we should bring him in.<eos> Why?<eos> He said he saw two guys run out, blood all over the office, but we've got no blood trail and nothing on security cameras.<eos> The security cameras don't cover the back stairway.<eos> They must've known that.<eos> Then how'd they get in?<eos> No sign of a break-in.<eos> If Wemlinger did it, where's the murder weapon?
[police radio chatter] Looks like he went for a walk to get snacks and got shot instead.<eos> We're sorry for your loss.<eos> - Winston was your...<eos> - SHERRI: Nephew.<eos> - nephew.<eos> - My sister's son.<eos> I raised him since he was 2.<eos> Do you remember what happened, if he had any beef with anyone?<eos> I don't exactly know.<eos> But there was some kind of argument at the party, but I didn't see it.
Dustin, look at me.<eos> This isn't over.<eos> There's gonna be years of appeals, and I'm not going to leave you, I promise you.<eos> I'm going to be by your side the whole way.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> What?<eos> I got something, sir.<eos> Thank you for your support.<eos> - Gentlemen, please.<eos> - Appreciate it.
The jaw bone sends sound waves to your inner ear.<eos> No one will hear but you.<eos> And you know how to implant this, right?<eos> Would you relax?<eos> I went to med school.<eos> Not dental school, though.<eos> Oh. Oh, God.<eos> I tapped into the prison's security cameras, we can see you from here, we can control when the guards see you on their monitors.<eos> We'll be with you the whole time.<eos> You get in, find the code's manual, memorize it, the warden brings you back, 90 minutes tops.
- We built a hall in the gorge.<eos> I am the mistress and Uhtred is a warrior.<eos> - Not a servant?<eos> - It is a game.<eos> - A wolf!<eos> - Uhtred.<eos> That's it, a wolf.<eos> Boar!<eos> Watch out!<eos> I saw it... it had sharp teeth and yellow eyes.
Leofric:<eos> Shield wall!<eos> - Now kill the bastards!<eos> - [All shouting]<eos> [Panting]<eos> Bind them tightly.<eos> If any object, march them into the river!<eos> Get this inside your belly, arseling.<eos> [Sighs]<eos> God knows you deserve it.
- Did the baptism go well?<eos> - That's a fine tree.<eos> - Good day, lady.<eos> - A miserable day.<eos> - Where was it felled, this tree?<eos> - On the top Ridge, Lord.<eos> - On my land?<eos> - Yes, Lord.<eos> I'm taking it to Wigulf's mill for splitting.<eos> - He buys it?
May I leave now?<eos> How many pieces of silver did you receive?<eos> As your price?<eos> 18.<eos> Is that correct?<eos> The price was 33.<eos> I'm sure it was an honest mistake.<eos> You were robbed.<eos> As I was robbed.<eos> That price is your security, and you'll have it.
No, you will what?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, it's my money, all right?<eos> I'm going.<eos> You go? - Yeah.<eos> - You can't.<eos> You can't.<eos> They're expecting me.<eos> They're expecting cash.<eos> They're not going to care who brings it.
Dude, trust me.<eos> He's serious.<eos> If he kills me, you'll never find your sister or your boyfriend.<eos> - There's a place.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Day's drive from here.<eos> About a year ago, they put out word to local PDs, 10 grand a head for anyone with powers.<eos> What kind of place?<eos> The kind where they keep Evos.<eos> They call it Sunstone Manor.
Excuse me.<eos> Get the hell out of here.<eos> I want the real doctor.<eos> You've had a series of parenchymal hemorrhages.<eos> You just learn that word?<eos> They're small bleeds in your brain caused by multiple concussions.<eos> I hit hard.<eos> Well, the blows to your head have created a serious problem.<eos> Darius said he's got medicine.<eos> The medication will mitigate it, yeah.
Get me two urinary catheters.<eos> - Urinary catheters?<eos> - Two folies.<eos> Now, please.<eos> Okay, we're gonna make a tamponade.<eos> - Dr. Lorenson?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Give me that coffee over there.<eos> Jesse: Right there. Right there.<eos> I need any liquid, and I need it now, all right?
Hear that sound?<eos> It's working.<eos> Blood pressure's tanking.<eos> Let's, uh, squeeze some fluids into her.<eos> Starting the incision now.<eos> Wait. What?<eos> - Urinary catheter.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> It's what Dr. Rorish used with that kid with the nose bleed.<eos> She fed the catheter, and she filled it with liquid to put pressure on the artery.
Well wonder what it will cost me. Mm. Excuse me, Madam Secretary.<eos> Madam Secretary.<eos> Do you have a minute?<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> - May I?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> - Great.<eos> Okay.<eos> Conrad's all about his new golden boy, and I'm stuck playing second fiddle.<eos> More like they took my fiddle and gave it to Craig Sterling.
Seven miles west of the Nile.<eos> Within this expansive archaeological site lies the ruins of the Osiris Hall, where thousands would gather to worship the god of the underworld.<eos> TSOUKALOS: In comparison to many of the gods, Osiris is actually thought to have lived physically on Earth as one of Egypt's Pharaohs.<eos> He is often depicted with a winged disc of the sun.<eos> And while many scholars have suggested that this is nothing else but, uh, to worship the sun, that sun, as far as the Egyptians were concerned, also had wings and it descended from the sky.<eos> So in my opinion, something else was depicted:<eos> an extraterrestrial event that in fact took place in real life.<eos> Although most ancient astronaut theorists believe that the Egyptian gods were, in reality, extraterrestrial visitors, there are many who wonder if Osiris was even made of flesh and blood.<eos> One of the most famous stories that go hand in hand with Osiris was that he was dismembered by his jealous brother, Seth.<eos> JONATHAN YOUNG: Seth went into a fury and tore his brother's dead body to shreds, tore it into 14 pieces, had it scattered far and wide all over the kingdom.
If you'll just come with me.<eos> Each nurse would be in charge of one floor to herself.<eos> She'd have one or two people below her to help out.<eos> But that way, it kept things nice and consistent for everyone.<eos> This place is huge.<eos> Yeah, three wards, 500,000 square feet.<eos> And enough equipment to treat hundreds of sick patients.<eos> It doesn't look that old, for something built almost 200 years ago.<eos> Well, the building has gradually been renovated over the years.<eos> I mean up until the county closed it, 32 years ago.
What?<eos> Come on.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now this is more like it.<eos> Do you think this is where the doctor killed that baby?<eos> If I remember correctly, this is the only place in the sanitarium where a woman could give birth.<eos> You know a lot about this place, huh?<eos> Yeah, my father used to bring me here a lot, as a child.<eos> You know, before they closed it down.
So, suicide, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Nasty way to die, but given the grace he showed his victims, it's well-deserved.<eos> How long until you have confirmation it's him?<eos> - Uh, a few days.<eos> - Call as soon as you know something.<eos> Could you move it along, please, ma'am?<eos> We're trying to keep the street clear.<eos> Hey, the, uh, search dogs pick up anything?<eos> No, they had his scent up until the backyard, but then they lost it, so looks like our guy never escaped the fire.
I mean, do I look like a guy that works in Accounting, named Adam, to you?<eos> Okay, I think their demographic is slightly larger than that.<eos> Or a young dad named Chris?<eos> Now you're just naming people you know who wear Banana Republic.<eos> I'm not an assistant principal named Markel, Maxine.<eos> Where are you even getting these names from?<eos> Okay, look, since it's your birthday, I thought we could do something fun today like check out that new Italian food cart.<eos> You want me to eat on the streets?<eos> - For my birthday?<eos> - Okay, but the guy who opened it almost made it onto Top Chef Boston.
We have a problem.<eos> We'll need you to come to the police station in the morning to give a full statement.<eos> Of course.<eos> Ilyana.<eos> How are you here?<eos> Wh... where's General Arsanov?<eos> How dare you try to ship me to Chechnya like piece of meat.<eos> General order it.<eos> I was carrying out his wishes.<eos> Doku would have wanted it.
And I was asking the universe.<eos> I was saying, "Change the way I see the world - so I can see my way out of doing sex work." - CAITLYN:<eos> DRIAN: So I felt really horrible about that,<eos> - that I really...<eos> - CAITLYN: Have you ever<eos> - talked to Janet Mock about it? - DRIAN:<eos> No.<eos> CAITLYN: You should read her book.<eos> - DRIAN:<eos> Yeah. - CAITLYN: That's how she paid for it.
God!<eos> Those... those words are too close to mean completely different things.<eos> It started when I was 16 and I was on a flight from New York to London.<eos> While I was on the flight, I was sitting next to this woman, and she asked me if I would hold her baby while she went to the bathroom.<eos> And at first, I was...<eos> I was doing great.<eos> Let me show you.<eos> So, I...<eos> I don't know what happened.<eos> All of a sudden, the baby... slipped out of my hands, rolled down my legs, and I caught it with my feet like this.
We need to pay mr. Senarak a visit.<eos> You saw me sitting in my car?<eos> On surveillance footage at victory station, yes.<eos> Is it a crime to be in my car?<eos> The bus that was attacked with sarin this morning stopped at that station, So we have to look at anything unusual.<eos> Wait, you think i had something to do with the sarin attack?<eos> We just want to know what you were doing in your car, Because the bus came and went while you were still there.<eos> Look, we know that you and your wife are both city link commuters.<eos> You both have monthly passes.<eos> You've taken that bus every single day For he past month, and yet today you both missed it.

Persistent.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> What?<eos> Theo's been missing for two days.<eos> His brother was here earlier looking for him.<eos> May i?<eos> It looks like theo sent you a text two days ago.<eos> "meet me at the desert bloom inn, 10 p.M., room 3.<eos> I never--i never got this.<eos> Because charlie had your phone, Which means that he saw it.
And how are you enjoying France?<eos> I'm still waiting to be granted an audience with the king.<eos> King Francis has traveled to the Cathedral in Reims for a period of seclusion and prayer.<eos> When he returns, you will be the first received.<eos> He's already sniffing around. Oh... !<eos> I thought Catherine was in the infirmary because she fell.<eos> That's what the servants thought when they found her a few days ago, but it turns out she's recovering from self-inflicted wounds.<eos> Self-inflicted how?<eos> Catherine threw herself against a door, repeatedly, and then bit out a piece of her own cheek.<eos> A servant found it this morning whilst cleaning the dungeon.

Are you kidding me?<eos> What do you think you're going to find in there?<eos> Very clever, Nina.<eos> My name is Laura.<eos> And where do you think I hid my chocolate from you all those years?<eos> Dirty laundry?<eos> In the crock pot that your mom insisted we get.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wax to remove the hair from her face and head.<eos> Make it look she lost it through chemo.
Meredith has the floor.<eos> Here she's blogging about stage two in November.<eos> December she's worse, white blood cell count dropping.<eos> January, blogging about stage three.<eos> And as she gets more sicker, more reposts, more likes, more followers.<eos> She went from having no one to being showered with affection and support.<eos> A worldwide network of friends, from here to the Philippines.<eos> What's in the corner?<eos> Our big finish.<eos> We found it on Nina's hard drive.
Yes, there was all that, but there was something else we could steal from France.<eos> As usual, the French offered little resistance.<eos> So, I entered a small village in rural Normandy and went to one of the finest kitchens in the country to see how they prepare a gourmet meal.<eos> By my standards, it was a three, maybe a four-star kitchen.<eos> It was definitely the best place to eat in town.<eos> It was the school cafeteria.<eos> I only had one year of French in school.<eos> Would you like to hear my first lesson in French?<eos> - Yes.<eos> The French love their cheese and they eat a lot of it.
They've got their own laundry, they've got a pantry, and, yes, they've got their own knives, too.<eos> Where are your guns?<eos> - We don't...<eos> - We don't need it.<eos> - You don't need any guns?<eos> - No. We talk to the guys.<eos> That's our weapon.<eos> - Your weapon is your mouth?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> When it comes to do the job, they will do it good, you know, because the officers, they serve you.
Impenetrable.<eos> It lasted less than 30 years.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And, in a night, it was over.<eos> I remember that, and around the same time, Mandela got out of prison and then became the president of South Africa.<eos> And those two events...<eos> Like, from that moment on in my life,<eos> I was like, "Oh, I get it. Anything can happen."<eos> They always say the solution is too complicated, but there's always simple answers to these things.<eos> You just take the hammer and you knock it down.
We just needed to go to the American lost and found.<eos> Maybe that was the answer.<eos> Oh, will you help me?<eos> Can you help me?<eos> You don't need to be helped any longer.<eos> You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.<eos> I have?<eos> Yes, you have.<eos> And so have we.<eos> We've always had it.
No, she isn't.<eos> - Ask your mom for the toolbox.<eos> - She won't lend you it.<eos> It's Dad's.<eos> Your dad isn't even here.<eos> When I took his hammer without asking, she grounded me.<eos> Tell her it's for me.<eos> - She'll say no.<eos> - Tell her it's for me!<eos> - She won't lend it.
Come here, Cacá.<eos> Come here.<eos> Let's go eat.<eos> - How long will you be with us?<eos> - For as long as needs be.<eos> Stop crying.<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> - It wasn't you that drew this horse?<eos> - It wasn't me.<eos> - Who drew it then? - It was Zé.
The last time I saw you, you were a little...<eos> Off.<eos> Well, clearly...<eos> Grief manifests itself in unpredictable ways.<eos> I think we've put studio-54 April to bed, so to speak.<eos> Which April do we get next?<eos> I think writer April.<eos> I've written two more chapters and a 22-page book proposal... Single-spaced and...<eos> Drum roll, please.<eos> I've been sending it out to lit agents.
You know, I tried to do you a favor...<eos> Putting your design in my show and you steal the spotlight?<eos> You know, you make it all about you!<eos> Oh, God, Jaclyn, I didn't mean to steal anything.<eos> I am so grateful that you included my design.<eos> I mean, I can't thank you enough.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> You're still humble.<eos> Now, as you know, I find your design to be perfectly acceptable...<eos> But the press, of course, it seems has found it just...

Anybody ever ID her?<eos> No, they tried, but there was no report of a missing kid.<eos> Victim never comes back to the car.<eos> How long before the husband reported her missing?<eos> Six hours.<eos> If I recall, the husband was the primary suspect.<eos> He had no alibi but was never charged.<eos> Not enough evidence.<eos> No history of marital problems.<eos> Patrol came back six hours later, found her car right where she left it.
- Let go of me!<eos> - You're not leaving.<eos> - No!<eos> - I'm calling the police.<eos> You're hurting me!<eos> Wait, I need those!<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> I don't hear you coughing.<eos> It's for my little sister. Please!<eos> If I had money, I'd pay for it.
So you moved back to Portland.<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> Well, that's perfect timing.<eos> You know, if you ever feel like coming back to work.<eos> Berman would hire you in a second.<eos> Really?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Berman hated to lose you.<eos> And just between us, if you decide to come back, ask for more money.<eos> He'll pay it.
- Wait.<eos> - What; what'd you see?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Keep going.<eos> There.<eos> Doesn't that look like the truck from the other footage?<eos> What other footage?<eos> There's other footage?<eos> - The Wendy Henley case.<eos> - Yeah, pulling it up.
You want me to do that, I will.<eos> But you've always said we're a family, and families keep things like this in the family.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I'm not sure if congratulations are in order, but since we have no other choice, I'm going to choose congratulations.<eos> - You saw the memo? - I did.<eos> You're making partner.<eos> No, Rachel, I'm not.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Jessica told me to turn it down.
I do.<eos> You're doing this.<eos> As managing partner, I am officially giving you your first case.<eos> - Oh my God.<eos> - What?<eos> It's tradition that the managing partner to give all new junior partners their first case.<eos> - Is that what this is?<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> Congratulations, Mike.<eos> It may not be what I wanted, but I really did mean it when I said you deserve it.
- Such as?<eos> - Walking out the door, for one.<eos> I'm not walking out of my own office.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because when someone points a gun at you, you don't turn around and run away.<eos> You take it out of their hand and you point it right back.<eos> Well, sometimes the best way to get someone to stop firing bullets at you is to take off your armor.<eos> What the hell kind of bullets are you talking about?<eos> Emotional ones.<eos> Harvey, Louis lashed out at you because he was feeling pain, and instead of showing you his hurt, he covered it with anger.
Oh, you can abstain all you want, but everyone's gonna know exactly where you stand.<eos> They already know where I stand.<eos> And it's not with you.<eos> You slapped her with a lawsuit?<eos> Did she call you? No, she called Google, and then they called me to tell me they're pulling out of the deal.<eos> - What? - Yeah, they don't want to run the risk this thing gets tied up in litigation, so they're out.<eos> - Mike, I can explain.<eos> - No, you don't have to explain.<eos> You explained the last time we talked.<eos> Excuse me? You've got a problem with Claire, and you're taking it out on this case.

Strategically our position on Hrushevskogo Street was very unfavorable.<eos> But it was a perfect vantage-ground for the Internal Troops.<eos> They started shooting at us with rubber bullets.<eos> They also attached bolts and screws to stun grenades, so they caused as much damage as possible.<eos> The Ukrainian people will determine who's in charge.<eos> We chose this president, and we can take him out.<eos> People were not afraid here.<eos> It was more frightening to watch all of these events on TV, than to come here to participate in them.<eos> From here, we were throwing Molotov cocktails and stones.<eos> Take gas, machine oil and saltpeter, mix it together and shake well.
These are the ones-- the classics we all grew up with, right? Those are, like, the "To Kill a Mockingbird" of sex terms.<eos> But there are so many that you've never heard of.<eos> I love hearing new ones. There's, like... there's the dirty Rochester...<eos> Did you ever hear of that?<eos> Okay, that is where the guy shits on your chest while he's on a business trip to Rochester.<eos> Is that maybe not really a thing and I was perhaps lied to?<eos> - There-- there's the dolphin.<eos> That's where the guy tries to put it in the girl's butt and she goes, "Ehh-ehh, ehh-ehh."<eos> That's, like, a fun family one.<eos> There's... the Alaskan pipeline, which, um... a guy shits in a condom, freezes it... and then you know what?

There's no question that the mystery would be what they were looking for, what they found, could it possibly have been ancient alien technology?<eos> Ancient astronaut theorists suggest that even more compelling than the hexagonal formation is what appears at another spot that was filmed:<eos> the Shorty Crater.<eos> SCHMITT: There is orange soil!<eos> CERNAN: Well, don't move it until I see it.<eos> SCHMITT: It's all over!<eos> Orange!<eos> BARA: In Shorty Crater, you can see orange soil that was discovered at the landing site.<eos> And the reason the soil was orange was because it had a great deal of oxygen in it, which was kind of a surprise.<eos> But the biggest surprise is, if you actually look in the crater, what you see are objects that at first might to the naked eye appear to be rocks, but in fact, as you study it with an engineer's eye,
It is rumored that some members of the Bohemian Club also belonged to private groups called "breakaway civilizations"<eos> that have developed advanced technologies independent of world governments.<eos> I've had insiders that have told me that they worked in this space program, that we do have a breakaway civilization that is extremely advanced.<eos> That we already have diplomatic relationships with a variety of extraterrestrial species and cultures.<eos> Narrator: Is it possible von Braun knew of the existence of extraterrestrials?<eos> Might his extraordinary efforts to reach space have been motivated by a desire to come in contact with otherworldly beings?<eos> Could it have been part of his plan all along for us to have a private space industry that operated in secret?<eos> For the last 60-some years, we've developed no new propulsion technologies at all.<eos> And that seems very, very unlikely.<eos> So the question becomes, at what point did NASA actually develop the next level of propulsion technology and maybe take it secret?

6 years ago the unsubs separated the victims by gender.<eos> The bodies of the boys were found out by the register, the two girls were found in the back office.<eos> Yeah, we profiled that was about control.<eos> Isolate the males who were more of a threat.<eos> Exactly.<eos> They even blindfolded them.<eos> But they didn't do that this time.<eos> No blindfolds, and the 3 victims were found in the same area, all within a few feet of each other.<eos> Dee's Original Diner had a back office.<eos> Why didn't they use it?

That... is what we were celebrating.<eos> It was science... at its most powerful.<eos> Science?<eos> And was it science that made you dig up the skull of a Redcoat general to help you?<eos> I didn't dig anything up.<eos> Sarah had this weird idea that thing had power, but I didn't buy it.<eos> You know, I just thought it was... like a rabbit's foot... for good luck.<eos> Where is that rabbit's foot now?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> The last time I saw it was... in the lab when we... did it, but after Sarah crossed over, we weren't thinking about the skull.

An FBI file number.<eos> I don't know how I didn't catch it before.<eos> It's heavily redacted, but it appears to have something to do with Saul Guerrero, leader of the Nuestra Sangre gang.<eos> You're listed as the case officer.<eos> Do you remember this file?<eos> I'll take a look.<eos> Later.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Just... all right.<eos> Just let me know, and we'll... got it.
No, my job is to save the human race.<eos> If we do nothing, our destruction is guaranteed.<eos> That is insane.<eos> No...<eos> It's already spiraling out of control.<eos> In your lifetime, we're gonna see famine, drought, poverty, on an unimaginable scale.<eos> Somebody's got to have the courage to do what has to be done to save the human species.<eos> Walter found out, didn't he?<eos> And that's why you killed him.<eos> All these diseases that we're trying so desperately to find a cure for are actually the last-ditch effort of a dying planet trying to save itself, trying to wipe out the thing that is actually destroying it: us.
I wouldn't have to chase you down.<eos> I'll pay you as soon as I can.<eos> Jets lost today.<eos> That makes it 40 Gs now.<eos> Let's go again.<eos> Double or nothing.<eos> No.<eos> That's how you got in this hole.<eos> I want my money.<eos> I'll get it to you.
Why don't you worry about you?<eos> You saw what the CIA did to Dodi.<eos> This is your last chance to help yourself.<eos> You wanna breathe fresh air again?<eos> Do you want to see the sun?<eos> ! It's too late for me.<eos> Answer me!<eos> Answer me!<eos> What... the hell?<eos> You'll never find it.
Patterson's outfitted each team with one of these.<eos> Portable Geiger counters.<eos> This should lead us right to them.<eos> These potassium iodide pills should prevent you from getting radiation poisoning until we can recover and contain the cesium.<eos> - Bottoms up.<eos> - One more thing.<eos> The higher the CPMs, the less time you should stick around.<eos> Once they hit 300, get the hell out.<eos> After that, all the potassium iodide in the world is not gonna help you for long.<eos> Think they'll find it?
Yeah, it was my sister's idea.<eos> How worried do I have to be about your objectivity on this case?<eos> You don't.<eos> It was a family dinner.<eos> I mean, my nephew was there, it was... there was nothing inappropriate. No.<eos> No, I ju... no, I...<eos> That guy had a tattoo of a tree on his arm, and Weller doesn't have that.<eos> Dreams aren't literal, they're impressionistic.<eos> Your body is covered in tattoos, symbols you don't understand.<eos> Now, you described it as a tree with deep roots.
Leonard Gail doesn't exist.<eos> I knew she was lying.<eos> Or, Leonard Gail does exist and the NSA is lying, like they've lied to everyone about everything ever.<eos> Well, what does your gut tell you?<eos> Are we dealing with a government agent or a kid who's read too many spy novels?<eos> What if it's neither?<eos> So, the owl is just a personal thing?<eos> It didn't come from anywhere else?<eos> Because we can't find it referenced anywhere.<eos> Did you design it?
Of course the NSA told you that Leonard doesn't exist.<eos> His job is like 100 levels above your clearance.<eos> Look at these.<eos> They're recent crimes targeted at government vehicles... which were located by your software.<eos> No.<eos> Yes.<eos> No, my... my software isn't real.<eos> It was just a proof of concept.<eos> It wasn't for people to actually use.<eos> Well, "people" are using it.
No.<eos> Yes.<eos> No, my... my software isn't real.<eos> It was just a proof of concept.<eos> It wasn't for people to actually use.<eos> Well, "people" are using it.<eos> Did you ever meet Leonard Gail in person?<eos> No.<eos> You didn't give your software to the good guys.<eos> You gave it to someone very dangerous.
Who is Shawn?<eos> Shawn Palmer.<eos> He approached me online a few months ago.<eos> He said that he was hiring freelancers for his cyber security firm.<eos> So, I did a few projects for him and then he said he wanted to meet me in person, that he had this big opportunity.<eos> All right, so he was the guy that said he worked for the NSA.<eos> Yes, and other, less-reputable businesses.<eos> Look, he said the NSA wanted to test their GPS security, and he told them that if I couldn't break in, that nobody could.<eos> He promised that they'd hook me up with a job after if I pulled it off.<eos> So, I wrote the code and then he sent it to his contact.
Hey, robby. You should stay home tonight.<eos> More fun to be had here.<eos> Not for us.<eos> Unless you're offering.<eos> Not even in your dreams.<eos> We takin' any trophies tonight?<eos> I want a trophy!<eos> No, we're not takin' any damn trophies.<eos> I want a rat's ass!<eos> Well, you're not gettin' it.
I hear something.<eos> There!<eos> I see him.<eos> Where'd he go?<eos> Sounds like from in there.<eos> This whole mound could be some kind of...<eos> Nest. You think they're inside?<eos> If there is an inside.<eos> There's got to be an opening somewhere.<eos> Hey, think i found it.
You want to get the word out to other agencies?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey.<eos> On that subway platform, you had your gun on him, the shot was clean, why didn't you take it?<eos> Crowd spooked me.<eos> A lot of ricochet in a concrete tunnel.<eos> You have to take care of this yourself, you know that, right?<eos> They think you killed Eli.<eos> But you know that already, that's why you took Eli's phone.<eos> Once you turn it on, the GPS will ping to a tower in about 40 seconds, so work fast.
Anyone on the fence about joining the Caliphate just got a big push toward it.<eos> We're rushing to shut down availability of the video here.<eos> My team's handling international traffic.<eos> In the meantime, sir,<eos> I advise evacuating all federally employed aid workers in and near ISIS territory.<eos> Do it.<eos> Good morning, Madam Secretary.<eos> I wish I could agree.<eos> I have the number for Luke Miller's parents when you're ready for condolences, ma'am.<eos> I have a P.A. working every international search and social media platform, burying that video so deep even Criterion Collection won't find it.
About 50 pounds.<eos> Huh.<eos> Okay, clamp coming off.<eos> Aw, damn it!<eos> Dr. Lin.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Jackson.<eos> Elizabeth Grant here for her final appointment.<eos> Exam room 3.<eos> Oh, and had a cake sent in, I take it.
Because he didn't fire that shot.<eos> One of you did.<eos> My God.<eos> Look at all that food.<eos> It's more than 100,000 calories there.<eos> Found this hidden on top of the cabinet near where Murphy was shot.<eos> We knew someone was stealing the food.<eos> But we thought they were eating it.<eos> Sounds like someone has a getaway stash.<eos> Murphy must have stumbled upon it and got shot.
Well we're gonna have to wait till the swelling goes down and he's conscious.<eos> If we try to move him now, it could kill him.<eos> What about this guy?<eos> Oh man, check this out.<eos> That thing about the bullet passing through Murphy and hitting this guy in the heart blew my mind you know.<eos> Got me thinking, If that tiny amount of Murphy blood could keep this guy from turning, what would a little bit more blood do?<eos> Doc.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> But it's the apocalypse.<eos> I figure go for it, right? So I've been soaking this rag in Murphy blood and letting Greg here suck on it.
Well, I guess I don't have to call him right this second.<eos> Damn right you don't.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> I've just heard back from Thames House.<eos> I'm sorry, but I've got nothing on that symbol from your necklace.<eos> MI5, MI6, Scotland Yard, no-one knows anything.<eos> You don't remember anything else from that night?<eos> What about Ted?<eos> Did the symbol mean anything to him?<eos> He said he'd never seen it before.
You are going to look so banging for the party tomorrow night.<eos> I mean, all this PLUS your gran's earrings?<eos> Damn, girl.<eos> Come with me.<eos> You have to.<eos> You're the birthday girl, you get what you want.<eos> Have them set it in the necklace and voila.<eos> But it's not even mine.<eos> It belongs to the people.<eos> Trust me, the people want their princess to wear it for her birthday.
#guyatus. 'Even though the cancer has metastasized, we can be more aggressive with our approach.<eos> Radiation and chemotherapy.<eos> There are experimental drugs we can explore.<eos> Don't give up hope.<eos> We can beat this thing.'<eos> I saw you picking up the money.<eos> You're just like the rest of them.<eos> The money is here.<eos> All of it.<eos> And I stacked it with King Simon facing down so you wouldn't have to see him. I've been thinking about what you said about giving up guys.
You listen to me, little man!<eos> The monument is going to happen!<eos> No, it isn't!<eos> And for your information, the King sort of runs things around here!<eos> Oh, do you really believe that?<eos> Because you don't. I do.<eos> I put you on the throne.<eos> And I humiliated myself with the paternity scandal.<eos> And now you're trying to rehabilitate your image with this monument.<eos> It's no wonder you had them make it out of glass, it's all so transparent!
I'm just...<eos> But yes, like, day to day.<eos> Why not?<eos> Why not... not burden us with expectations and...<eos> Because this isn't a burden.<eos> This is not a burden for me.<eos> I can't do this way.<eos> I can't do this version.<eos> That's not who I am, and you know that.<eos> So I'm not doing it.
Well, the Trevor Project.<eos> They're looking for people for their late night shifts.<eos> - Uh-huh. - It's intense, you know?<eos> It's mostly suicidal teens.<eos> Wow.<eos> That's important.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And, you know, the people who do it, the Life On Uppers, they go through a rigorous training program.<eos> Mm. Is the graveyard shift the only opening?<eos> We don't call it the graveyard shift because of the, you know, the nature of the calls.
- Bean!<eos> - What?<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey, there.<eos> Uh, um, I'm sorry.<eos> I just...<eos> I have my essay for you.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah. Just...<eos> Just drop it right there, and I'll get around to it.
My mother was an actress... really cheesy one.<eos> I tried the acting thing, I took off my top... wasn't really contributing to the betterment of society...<eos> Oh I disagree, I love that movie.<eos> So I quit.<eos> Decided to be come a cop, like my dad.<eos> And, ah... dealt with the whole "Hot Tub High School" thing, until, um, I became a detective and found a whole new way to ostracize myself.<eos> Ah, the reason your ex-maggot was pressuring you to close this?<eos> Yeah... yeah exactly.<eos> There was a case... a shooting on Palmetto Street, where a cop died.<eos> And I saw it differently than pretty much everyone in my department, including my ex.
You know, it can't always be about lesbians, and you are obsessed with lesbians.<eos> Okay... cancer.<eos> - Cancer's always good. - Um,<eos> - no.<eos> - No, no, we do...<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Cancer rates, Robin Roberts.<eos> Got that cancer, her cancer doubled the numbers overnight.<eos> I mean, thank God she's okay, but, you know, wow.<eos> I think cancer's only good for ratings though if you're the one who's got it.
When the Votanis Collective destroyed our fleet,<eos> Kindzi and I were lost.<eos> We knew the shape-takers had found a suitable planet to colonize.<eos> We just didn't know where it was.<eos> We drifted aimlessly through space, searching for any signal that would lead us to the Votan arks or their destination.<eos> Earth.<eos> We didn't know to call it that, but, yes.<eos> Throughout the long journey, hate kept me alive... focused.<eos> Kindzi learned hatred from watching me.<eos> I taught it to my daughter.
I think I'm gonna be sick.<eos> We have to stop them.<eos> Looks like we might be too late.<eos> [reporter] Now, just moments away from watching Prince Xander take off into the skies.<eos> Cam, call your dad!<eos> Voicemail.<eos> He's gotta be in the control room already.<eos> There's no way I can reach him now.<eos> The hacking device.<eos> If we can find a way into Space Inc., we can stop it from getting on that spacecraft.
Oh, I'm so proud of you.<eos> Ah, look, I heard what you said, and I took it to heart.<eos> The last thing I want is for my newfound wealth to inconvenience you in any way.<eos> - Oh...<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Which is why I'm moving out.<eos> - Huh?<eos> Uh, that's right, I found a new residence that's more suited to my new station in life.<eos> Haskell, you can't be serious.<eos> Uh, here are my keys, and, uh, and this is a check to cover, well... you'll know when you see it.
Your horse is at the back of the pack, but at the clubhouse turn, he makes his move, coming down the final stretch, it's neck and neck until your horse wins by a nose!<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Well, that didn't happen.<eos> You're broke.<eos> What?<eos> What do you mean I'm broke?<eos> Believe me, this was not easy for me to say.<eos> That's why I opened with the uplifting racetrack story.<eos> What the hell happened to my money?<eos> You were supposed to be managing it!
So you were the first one to arrive at the scene?<eos> Yes Sir.<eos> And what did you do?<eos> The servant was missing, so we began looking for him...<eos> You didn't call the forensics team to collect prints and samples?<eos> Sniffer dogs?<eos> Err... No Sir...<eos> Was there a cooler panel on Khempa_BAR_'s body?<eos> Er... why yes Sir, there was...<eos> Who must have kept it?
Yes Sir.<eos> And what did you do?<eos> The servant was missing, so we began looking for him...<eos> You didn't call the forensics team to collect prints and samples?<eos> Sniffer dogs?<eos> Err... No Sir...<eos> Was there a cooler panel on Khempa_BAR_'s body?<eos> Er... why yes Sir, there was...<eos> Who must have kept it?<eos> Who would have kept it?

Somewhere we have to find a balance between what the system wants you to do and what you feel is right as an individual.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Time for the Q and A.<eos> If anyone has any questions for Mr Kumar please proceed.<eos> Yeah, Sandeep...<eos> Sir, I was wondering since you're such an accomplished officer of your agency...<eos> Why did you take premature retirement?<eos> What made you quit?<eos> I guess I couldn't find the balance.<eos> Call me if any one of you guys find it.
- Piotrek found a skeleton in the ground.<eos> You fucking idiot!<eos> I didn't tell her anything.<eos> Get off me, will you?<eos> I came to say goodbye.<eos> I've got work to do tomorrow.<eos> Listen...<eos> There's no skeleton.<eos> It's the ravings of a sick mind.<eos> Żaneta, except no one's seen it.
I said, I'm in the middle of nowhere!<eos> What do I do?<eos> Okay, sir, I can't send an ambulance if I don't know where you are.<eos> Is there a cross street?<eos> No, there's...<eos> Um, there is some lights up ahead.<eos> I think there is a town a few miles ahead.<eos> Okay, so there's a town.<eos> Can you tell me anything about where that...<eos> I can't find it on my GPS, I'm sorry.
Okay, what's happening?<eos> Her leg is, is broken.<eos> She's bleeding really, really bad.<eos> All right.<eos> Focus.<eos> Need to stop the bleeding.<eos> I need you to look for anything you can use.<eos> -Like a tourniquet?<eos> -Yes.<eos> All right, I got it.
Yes, yes.<eos> Go get the glove.<eos> We can do this!<eos> We can save your vagina!<eos> Hurry before it's too late!<eos> Okay!<eos> It's taken me a little longer than I anticipated.<eos> - Here you go, sweetie.<eos> - What? !<eos> Don't give it to me.
- Mom.<eos> Mom.<eos> - Right here.<eos> It's okay. I got it.<eos> It's gone now.<eos> Gone. - Okay. Made you a sandwich, so you have...<eos> - Mom, are you kidding?<eos> - No, it's for you.<eos> Just stick it in your pocket<eos> - so you have it for later. I don't care if you eat it.
- Right here.<eos> It's okay. I got it.<eos> It's gone now.<eos> Gone. - Okay. Made you a sandwich, so you have...<eos> - Mom, are you kidding?<eos> - No, it's for you.<eos> Just stick it in your pocket<eos> - so you have it for later. I don't care if you eat it.<eos> - I don't want it.<eos> - I just want you to take it with you.
- Just take the sandwich so we can<eos> - all get on with our lives.<eos> - Mom...<eos> There are cranberries in it, and I want you to have it in case you need a snack.<eos> Okay.<eos> I love you!<eos> I wish your mom would shove her sandwich in my pants.<eos> Let's talk party options for the night.<eos> So he didn't want the sandwich.<eos> - I would've eaten it.
"Listen, I have a really big problem.<eos> I'm going to see my mother, and she's dying, but I don't love her."<eos> And Father Pierre said, "Okay.<eos> Well, just bring her some flowers and tell her you've always cared about her."<eos> And I thought, "I can do that.<eos> Besides, you really don't want to lie to someone who's dying."<eos> But when I got there, they were rushing her around in a gurney. And I didn't have time to get the flowers, and it was loud and confusing, and there wasn't a single moment to say,<eos> "You know, I've always cared about you."<eos> And then all of a sudden, she was dead.<eos> There's a Buddhist exercise called the mother meditation, and you use it when you can't feel anything.
We get the DNA sample, match it-- he faces justice.<eos> As do the 23 other men who are still hiding.<eos> How does catching Zoric catch them?<eos> It's rumored he carries an encrypted electronic ledger containing aliases of the other 23.<eos> Safe houses, bank accounts, contacts for fake passports.<eos> TOBY:<eos> Better move fast, Sonia.<eos> Running a complete genome sequence takes days under ideal circumstances.<eos> And if Zoric suspects he's been made, he'll be on the move again soon.<eos> This only works if we amp up the standard sequencer algorithm and put it in a device that runs that DNA test in seconds.
You can never be too careful these days... what with Lyme disease and everything.<eos> No, guess I'm clean.<eos> You know, I've been thinking.<eos> I've been talking about the werewolf and suddenly it's everywhere.<eos> What if...?<eos> Pine trees, pine trees, pine trees.<eos> No way!<eos> I say it and I see it.<eos> Rocks.<eos> I shall call this power The See-cret and use it responsibly.
So when my dad said he could get me in here, I jumped at it.<eos> Big mistake.<eos> Did you know that they opened this place up in 1932?<eos> Light bulbs weren't bright enough back then, so they put in all these big windows so they could see what they were doing.<eos> Imagine that.<eos> Hell of a night for you two.<eos> Started off saving a life, ended up almost killing someone.<eos> Two people, actually.<eos> I missed an epidural hematoma.<eos> I missed it, too. Hm. Know what that sounds like to me?
Daily Planet News with Lois Lane.<eos> Today's top story: justice by sea.<eos> Looks like Black Manta is the catch of the day.<eos> Justice by land.<eos> This Penguin is going to need an ice pack. - Ha-ha.<eos> Justice in space.<eos> I bet Sinestro is now aware of the gravity of his situation.<eos> I hope supervillains have health insurance because it looks like they're gonna need it.
-Maybe he should be the leader.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We made it.<eos> Unfortunately, we only have six parking spots so goodbye.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You're in.<eos> And welcome to all our new members.<eos> Keep your kudos, Lex.<eos> What we want is crime.<eos> And so you shall have it, Cheetah.
That's so great! Yeah, there's Fisherman's Wharf and Alcatraz and cable cars.<eos> We're gonna have so much fun.<eos> We?<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> Oh, no, no!<eos> I just, I said, "Whee!"<eos> How dare you go on the Internet and say mean things about me and compare my genitalia to part of Czechoslovakia?<eos> You saw through that one, did you?<eos> I don't know what you were thinking, but take the video down now!<eos> She watched it.
We?<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> Oh, no, no!<eos> I just, I said, "Whee!"<eos> How dare you go on the Internet and say mean things about me and compare my genitalia to part of Czechoslovakia?<eos> You saw through that one, did you?<eos> I don't know what you were thinking, but take the video down now!<eos> She watched it.<eos> I'm gonna get that girl back.<eos> I only watched it because you e-mailed it to me with the subject line: "This is gonna make you mad"!
Well, Darlene, between you and me, what I'm doin' here is a little secret.<eos> Oh, you seem like a man with secrets.<eos> - You know, I'm going on a break.<eos> You wanna take the sky tram up to Widow's Peak?<eos> Take my advice or don't, but clearly, I know what I'm doing.<eos> Oh, fancy.<eos> Oh, I can't believe this is happening.<eos> A real date.<eos> I wonder what they'll name the baby.<eos> If I had a baby, I would name it Grenda 2:
Pull Abby in, too.<eos> Let's just remember whose computer we're talking about here-- getting into Dorney's hard drive?<eos> Well, that can be an adventure on its own.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> That was the warden from Lee Penitentiary.<eos> Apparently your walk included a visit with Matthew Rousseau.<eos> Would you mind telling me why?<eos> Just following up.<eos> With your pen stuck in his hand?<eos> Is that where I left it?
I have to go organize this earthquake drill, which could not come at a worse time.<eos> But I'm just gonna power through.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Some weird sibling instinct deep in my brain told me to reach out to you. Hmm. And now, another instinct is telling me to let go 'cause your hand is like a sweaty meat pie.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Wait, I love you, though.<eos> Oh, I'm so glad you're here.<eos> But Patti didn't send you that text.<eos> I sent it from her phone.
Thanks, babe.<eos> You know, you guys should check it out, too.<eos> A Z-SPAN interview on Dad's book about St. Francis that I already hear too much about?<eos> Well, if you actually read your father's work instead of trashing it, you'd know how totally UN-Franciscan that was.<eos> HENRY: Oh, word.<eos> I humbly and meekly apologize.<eos> JASON: He was also sort of a revolutionary.<eos> Completely rejected any form of material wealth.<eos> STEVIE: He also led the first environmental movement.<eos> Wait, you guys read it?
I hope that's okay, Mr. President.<eos> So what's this proposal?<eos> Yeah. Um...<eos> So, in going over the proposed budget for Craig's military transformation initiative,<eos> I, uh, saw an opportunity where I thought State might be able to contribute, using our diplomatic relations with Nepal.<eos> I proposed to their prime minister the idea of an observatory in the Himalayas.<eos> It is a highly strategic spot for optical, infrared, and gamma ray observation.<eos> It's strategic, all right.<eos> It's right on the border of China.<eos> Which is why Nepal will never sign off on it.
The second one he took credit for, but it was dismantled by a rival artist before anyone could see it.<eos> Didn't realize it was that cutthroat.<eos> Yeah, competition among street artists is intense.<eos> It's like turf wars.<eos> Well, according to this, Morpheus has a website where he always posts his work.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> He doesn't post any comments.<eos> It's through a proxy server, so it's impossible to trace.<eos> He took credit for the first 3 pieces in Detroit, but there's been nothing on the website about the Russell Pearson murder.<eos> Because he didn't do it?
The hell I can't.<eos> I should have seen something like this coming.<eos> Why?<eos> Did you have reason to think she might be in danger?<eos> Not her specifically, but my property was vandalized and then Pearson turned up murdered.<eos> I should have moved my family out of town, you know, hired more security, something.<eos> Wait, your house was vandalized.<eos> My business.<eos> I've got a storage facility downtown and that guy they call Morpheus put graffiti all over it last week.<eos> Even put it on his website.
I love parallel searches.<eos> You should know that the original search is not going well, and I would really appreciate it if you guys would put your noggins together and give me a nudge in how to proceed.<eos> Ok, well, this person would follow the exact geographical timeline that you built for Morpheus.<eos> We think the unsub might have his home base on the Gulf coast of Florida.<eos> See if any money from the various locations in your geo-profile was wired to or from there.<eos> That's a beautiful nudge.<eos> Thank you.<eos> In Morpheus' first art piece in Detroit, we found a distinctive blue chalk spray with a UV-resistant fixative.<eos> He used the same material in New Orleans several years ago.<eos> I'd check to see if he ordered it from the same outlet or found a similar source nearby.
He asked if we could go.<eos> I panicked.<eos> I shot myself in the foot.<eos> Oh, yeah, you shot yourself on your foot, you put your foot in your mouth, you put the shoe in the wrong foot.<eos> What is with you Americans and the foot?<eos> I hate that painting, by the way.<eos> I'm having the last cronut.<eos> I'm so depressed.<eos> I'm sorry, kid.<eos> I think Andy ate it.
I mean, obviously, like, a surfer would rather live in an expand-o trailer on a perfect point break than have a mansion in Beverly Hills with 45 servants and eight Rolls Royces.<eos> I mean, it's just where your priorities are.<eos> At the time, if you go, "I'm a surfer," they go, "Oh, God, poor guy."<eos> The high school I went to had 3,000 kids, and I was the only surfer.<eos> - And where was that?<eos> - That was in Long Beach.<eos> In 1959, the movie "Gidget" came out, and surfing went from just a small amount of surfers, trace amount, to several million by '63.<eos> The Endless Summer came out in 1964, '65, and opened in Kansas City.<eos> And there were guys driving cars around with surfboards sticking out the trunk that had never seen the ocean.<eos> "Endless Summer" showed the rest of the world what surfing was really like, and it was correct for the people that were in it.
I had no idea how to start something.<eos> I thought my business experience would be to just go to work for somebody and get a paycheck and learn.<eos> So we really had to make it up as we went along, just driving around town all day long finding fabric, Velcro, snaps.<eos> We'd get about 24 pairs out of production every day.<eos> I'd put the snaps in every pair.<eos> And we'd put them in my Volkswagen van, and drive to an account who would take as many as we could supply.<eos> I thought, "All right, well, this sounds fun."<eos> I can hang out at the beach.<eos> I can keep surfing.<eos> I have this little project, do it for a year or two, and then I'm going to go to graduate school. That was my plan.
I was four years old when I got my first motorcycle.<eos> And that became the next ten years.<eos> We just traveled the circuit.<eos> We were doing all the state rounds, and eventually the national championships.<eos> My dream has always been to jump big jumps on my motorcycle.<eos> I've always looked to the top of the pyramid as, like, that's the goal.<eos> I went to Evel Knievel's funeral.<eos> It was something that I just really wanted to go to and pay my respects because I really felt that we had some kind of tie.<eos> I stood in line to go up and just kind of say a prayer and stood in front of him, and, you know, kind of bowed my head.<eos> I just said, "Evel, I want to follow in your footsteps and take the torch where you've left it, and take it to a greater height and I want to do that with your blessing."
It's just like I felt like he gave me his blessing.<eos> When we all got out of school, it was like our skate gang.<eos> There was no age discrimination other than what my brother tried to put on me.<eos> It was always an uphill battle to get his approval for me to be around.<eos> Then I would also have to impress his friends for them to also, you know, to stand me, to be OK to be in the crew.<eos> So that drove me to push myself quite a bit.<eos> When I was a kid, I used to sit in class and draw ramps all the time, and I always had this vision that ramps could be a lot bigger.<eos> You know, why were they the size they were?<eos> I would sit there and brainstorm new ideas of things I could do when I got out of school on the ramp that day.<eos> When I think of a trick, when I'm sitting at my house, I come down here and learn it.
By watching something, it's learning by example, you know.<eos> You're getting taught visually.<eos> As far as, like, videos, that is so important.<eos> I think just as important, if not more important as winning any contest.<eos> That's really where the progression of skateboarding gets pushed to.<eos> People, they devote years to making a video part.<eos> That's how important it is.<eos> All their efforts of skateboarding, as a pro skater, if they're not competing, are going to making an amazing video part, and breaking themselves off in the process.<eos> That's what kids ask, "How do you do this trick every try?"<eos> I go out there and I do it every single day for this many years.
It's the fear that is probably the strongest in all of us, and to confront that and run off a cliff into the unknown, every cell in your body is on fire screaming, "Don't do it."<eos> When you know that you've undergone the proper training to get to the edge of this cliff, then you use that understanding, that reason and logic to cut through the screaming chatter and do it.<eos> We both went into a tumble due to the thin air and the heavy 16mm old clunky cameras that we had.<eos> I hadn't expected that.<eos> I thought I had pushed it too far.<eos> These sports used to be real rebel, counter-society,<eos> "don't go near them" sort of activities, to now they're readily acceptable, although the extreme part of it is getting more and more extreme.<eos> These guys have a crazy switch, and they can't wait to get there.<eos> They live for it.<eos> So they're pushing it, and by them pushing it, the next group wants to go bigger and higher, and it's just been pushed and pushed and pushed.
You are 100% responsible for yourself.<eos> You've got to know that knot's tied right.<eos> You've got to know who your partner is.<eos> You need the trust of a partner.<eos> I bring that up to our youngsters.<eos> I say, "Rock climbing is like what you guys do."<eos> "if you get yourself into something, how are you going to get out?"<eos> I think for me, sometimes it's just to see the potential in something and try to bring it out.<eos> Trying to grab surfing is like trying to hold a snowflake.<eos> You know, the minute you try to hold it and possess it, it melts.
Loubamir. You remember him?<eos> - He was a Czech count.<eos> - He was destitute.<eos> He was a Czech count!<eos> He played violin.<eos> He was very sweet, and Mother got rid of him in 15 minutes!<eos> And his family was penniless.<eos> He proposed to me from that tree.<eos> Please.<eos> A dog chased him up it, but he still proposed.

And evidence of this can be found throughout the world.<eos> The question "where are they?" should be answered with: "Look at the ancient astronaut theory," because we are suggesting that there is evidence that goes back thousands of years by the stories that we have of gods lowercase "G" descending from the sky.<eos> It doesn't matter on what continent.<eos> Every single continent was visited. CHILDRESS: I would say that the evidence is there and it's all around us, whether it's in megalithic sites that are aligned to constellations, such as the Great Serpent Mound in Ohio.<eos> Even the pyramids at Giza.<eos> And even stories of beings coming down in spaceships, interacting with people. Evidence is overwhelming that there are extraterrestrials all over the universe, and that they're coming here.<eos> According to ancient astronaut theorists, one of the earliest and most compelling pieces of evidence to support the notion that extraterrestrials have, in fact, visited Earth, can be found with an ancient Sumerian cylindrical seal known as VA243.<eos> Author Zecharia Sitchin was the first to suggest that on this seal, which is estimated to be at least 4,500 years old, is a depiction of our solar system.<eos> JASON MARTELL: You can see in the seal that there's a whole complete model of the solar system accurately being displayed with the sun in the center.<eos> Now, till the time of Copernicus and Galileo, no one knew that we actually orbited the sun, so the only explanation is someone who had this knowledge gave it to humanity, and that there has been extraterrestrial presence
David!<eos> What?<eos> Run!<eos> You know, if someone wanted to take President Eckhart out, your boss has the power to do it.<eos> "Little thieves get hanged, but the great ones rule the kingdom."<eos> Sums up David's clientele.<eos> He had that watch for years.<eos> Never went anywhere without it.<eos> Didn't even keep time.<eos> Well, he gave it to you for some reason.
You won't dirty the place.<eos> You've cleaned?<eos> Why the questions?<eos> Did I ask if you've washed today?<eos> I washed this morning.<eos> Glad to hear it.<eos> You have a piano.<eos> - No one touches it.<eos> - No problem.<eos> I've given it up.
I'll show her!<eos> You'll see one day.<eos> When your kids marry and you end up hating... their spouses.<eos> Wm at?<eos> Spouses... The ones they marry.<eos> Spouse is a pretty ugly word.<eos> It suits her to a T.<eos> No one touches that piano.<eos> I didn't touch it.<eos> I lock it for the fun of it?

I'm writing these lines in case we never see each other again.<eos> The doctor tells me that's an extremely likely possibility.<eos> These doctors are useless!<eos> Anyhow, this won't take long.<eos> Just a few words of advice for your future life.<eos> Don't walk around naked in front of others.<eos> Don't drink too much and ignore your father.<eos> I 'II leave you my slippers. You always pinched them anyway.<eos> And the piano too.<eos> I'd like you to have it.
The girl. Do you know her?<eos> No.<eos> But I know the other one.<eos> Known her a few times, actually.<eos> Can you get in touch with her?<eos> Zoe, do you know this girl?<eos> Yeah, I know her.<eos> "King of Bling takes a swing."<eos> "Demonstrators protest monarch's bad behavior."<eos> I would call it bold not bad.
Oh, I wouldn't worry about him.<eos> He's just whipped.<eos> Don't I know you somehow?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Go wait by the door.<eos> So we have a deal?<eos> You cross me, and I will skin you and your girlfriend alive and make myself a brand-new pair of calzones.<eos> - Whatever those are.<eos> - One, two, three, four!<eos> - He bought it.
Castle.<eos> Hey.<eos> I was just going to that, uh...<eos> Just going to the bodega there.<eos> Pick you something up...<eos> little slim Jim, yoo-hoo?<eos> Castle, how did you know that we were here?<eos> Did you put this tracker on me when you gave me that awkward hug?<eos> I have no idea what that is.<eos> But I'll take it off your hands.
Really?<eos> What is it?<eos> Well, now, if I told you that, you might not need me anymore.<eos> Then don't tell me.<eos> And since we're being honest, there's something that I have to tell you.<eos> I hated Moffet's book.<eos> What? !<eos> Wha...<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Because you gave it to me when we first started dating, and I knew it was important to you, so... I lied. I'm sorry.
And I will step down from CatCo.<eos> It seems Cat Grant's silence regarding the CatCo hack is about to be broken.<eos> But will today's press conference be a victory for the magnate, or a very sudden fall?<eos> Are you sure you want to do this?<eos> Well, like taxes, aging, And participating in Martha Stewart's annual Secret Santa, this is something I have to do.<eos> I don't know what I'm going to do after this.<eos> I don't know if there is anything I can do.<eos> I'm pretty sure you can do anything, Ms. Grant.<eos> Ker-rah.<eos> Whatever comes next, for what it's worth, you always have a job with me if you want it.
Apparently, Lucy feels the same way.<eos> We ran into each other at Noonan's.<eos> And she talked to you about me?<eos> She still loves you.<eos> No, she doesn't, she ended it.<eos> Because she felt you chose Superman over her.<eos> She was tired of coming in second.<eos> Look, I don't know anything about romantic love.<eos> I have not had the best luck with it.<eos> But if I ever really had it, I think I'd fight for it.
Pierced the sternum and punctured the heart.<eos> I estimate T.O.D. to be between 4:00 and 6:00 a.m.<eos> Murder by bow and arrow.<eos> That's kind of a unique M.O. for this century.<eos> You know what, though?<eos> I can understand the appeal.<eos> Arrows are quiet, untraceable, accurate from a distance.<eos> So, we got a remote location, middle of the night.<eos> I'm thinking maybe it could've been a money drop.<eos> And maybe the killer, seeing right away that the money is counterfeit, just leaves it here.
That's right-- followed by our Vic headed out to this secluded spot with a bag full of money.<eos> The whole thing adds up to just one thing.<eos> Crane was on his way to a ransom drop.<eos> This is a kidnapping.<eos> Jimmy, keep him on ice for me.<eos> You got it, Commander.<eos> All right.<eos> Let me know.<eos> All right, so the burner the kidnapper used had been turned off.<eos> CSU will track it if it powers back up.
One silk handkerchief, one fountain pen, one set of keys, one cell phone.<eos> Sign here.<eos> And this thing has been ringing like crazy.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Go for Gerard.<eos> You should really answer your phone, Mr. Hirsch.<eos> Who is this?<eos> Shut up and listen to me very carefully.<eos> So he wants the painting?<eos> Yes, and he threatened to kill this Laura Ioane woman and come after me if I don't hand it over.
That's a pretty desperate play.<eos> My question is how did he even know about the Hopper?<eos> Well, he probably had Crane under surveillance from the moment he put this thing in motion.<eos> If that's the case, last night when you went to Crane's house he would have you leave with the painting.<eos> Well, he said he would call back with a time and place for the drop.<eos> Well, that's perfect.<eos> When he does, you keep him talking, we'll run a trace.<eos> What we have to do, though, is get the painting back.<eos> So where is it now?<eos> Actually, I don't have it anymore. I flipped it to a collector this morning.
PIERCE:<eos> It's like surgery.<eos> You really do have the magic touch.<eos> Shh.<eos> Just listen.<eos> I don't hear anything.<eos> Well, it's probably too subtle for your untrained ear... but she's talking to me.<eos> The missing boys are 12 and ten.<eos> This phone is our strongest lead.<eos> We found it submerged in a fountain about three hours ago.
I am changing the toner.<eos> It's still not working.<eos> Yeah, that's because I just changed it, so, you just put the old toner back in.<eos> Huh. That's kind of like taking the new toilet paper off the roll and replacing it with used toilet paper.<eos> I'm just saying I've never done anything like that.<eos> Oh, problem with the copier?<eos> Did you try, uh, changing the toner?<eos> Okay.<eos> We, uh, got a case.<eos> I'll switch it back.
Do you realize that this is the first time I've made money that I can't get arrested for?<eos> That's great, Jodi.<eos> Remember your first honest buck?<eos> Yeah, it was the eggs.<eos> Okay, you know what you're gonna do with this money?<eos> Yeah... purple hair extensions.<eos> No.<eos> You're gonna take $100 out of here and send it to your sister.<eos> What?<eos> No, this is my money, I earned it.
No, I... I really want to be her friend.<eos> Like, genuinely want to be her friend.<eos> - Wink.<eos> Oh, that's, like, now!<eos> Change of plans.<eos> Eat the donut for me.<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> While I'm gone, pull up the Mendez file, and see what previous motions the plaintiff has put before the judge, okay?<eos> Yeah... I love this!<eos> Gonna use it on my car right now.
So the charges didn't stick and the case was dropped.<eos> Where can we find this Paula Guitteau?<eos> You can't.<eos> She committed suicide.<eos> Mrs Guitteau?<eos> I'm Detective Inspector Lewis.<eos> This is DI Hathaway.<eos> We'd like to talk to you about Paula.<eos> Paula loved the garden.<eos> She and Frank used to do it together.
Plus she said she hates confrontation.<eos> What, you're saying it's easier to send a bomb than just have a row?<eos> Well, we know she resented Adam's behaviour but couldn't bring herself to leave him.<eos> Which would make her resent him even more.<eos> And I've seen a lot of grieving widows, but never one like her.<eos> Right, I'm gone.<eos> I've got to skype Tony.<eos> They've just offered him another year.<eos> - Have you said yes?<eos> - We are thinking about it.
Why shouldn't we make some money?<eos> We've worked hard enough.<eos> So you agreed to sell to AKGC Pharmaceutical?<eos> Who have the wherewithal to develop a product that will change the world.<eos> What we've discovered is the first step.<eos> The toolbox, if you like.<eos> There's still a long way before there's a drug on the market.<eos> And if they want to pay us for that, where's the harm?<eos> Adam didn't seem to think that money was the issue.<eos> You never do when you have it.
Are they important?<eos> We found them at Paula Guitteau's home.<eos> A combination or something?<eos> - Well, if you think of anything...<eos> - Yeah. Of course.<eos> Er...<eos> Inspector?<eos> You wait here.<eos> He promised me money and then he went back on his word.<eos> I knew where he kept it and I thought the house would be empty after what happened.
Sounds like you guys could use an influx of cash.<eos> Who's ready to work?<eos> Organized crime members in Kazakhstan have obtained a Soviet 1970s-era nuke.<eos> They are preparing to sell it tomorrow night to the highest bidder.<eos> Starting price-- 20 million.<eos> And none of the potential buyers are our friends.<eos> Intel tracked the missile to an abandoned Soviet naval base on the Ishim River, containing 47 warehouses on 100 hectares.<eos> It's deserted, except for the occasional security patrol, but those guys are unarmed private contractors.<eos> We have no idea where the missile is on this base.<eos> So, you want the guys in the flea-infested garage to find it.
Stevie here snorts his way into ya-ya town and goes down in front of, what, 100 people in that club?<eos> Who do you think's got to mop up the mess?<eos> Cap, this doesn't fall on you.<eos> His dad may seem like Mr. Generosity when he's building hospitals and buying congressmen, but you know what happened to that guy on the zoning board who tried to block his last skyscraper?<eos> Neither does anybody else.<eos> You read the M.E. report?<eos> Yeah. It doesn't even come close to adding up.<eos> M.E. is saying heart attack, but they found a blood problem that wasn't on his medical records.<eos> Old man Stavros wants to bury his child, shut down the tabloid circus.<eos> And if I'm the one that keeps it open?
I don't even know how long I'm gonna be here.<eos> Yes, you are going to die.<eos> So am I.<eos> So is everyone else.<eos> But has it ever occurred to you... that that is the reason we have children in the first place?<eos> There's... something I need to tell you.<eos> I might have a son.<eos> And he might be really angry with me.<eos> Something I was trying to ignore.<eos> I was trying to... deny it, but... once I get a break from this case, I'm just gonna handle it and I'm gonna handle it head on.
It was pretty easy, and I didn't relish it.<eos> You may be a little harder, but I promise you, I'm gonna savor every moment.<eos> Rosie, you look terrible.<eos> Please, drink this.<eos> Here.<eos> Now, look, they wanted that body back yesterday.<eos> Plus, you need some rest.<eos> With your heart problem, you can't just...<eos> What I need is to find out whatever we missed in Stavros' autopsy.<eos> And no one's taking that body until we find it.
We found a client.<eos> She's willing to pay for three hours of an investigator.<eos> Really?<eos> How extravagant. Starting now?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> She's telling the truth.<eos> I bought the sweater for my daughter, for her birthday.<eos> - And do you have the receipt?<eos> - No, I think I threw it away.<eos> Do you know what day you bought it, ma'am?
First, you come between a mother and her son, and now you feel comfortable coming between a son and his daughter?<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> That's not what I mean.<eos> Is that why your wife wanted to end her life,<eos> - because of the pain?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Um, she was afraid she was losing control over her life.<eos> Ms. Lockhart has spoken a lot about this Duke brain tumor study.<eos> Would that have changed<eos> - Alexa's mind if she knew about it?
Luminox Deep Dive watch.<eos> Good to 500 meters.<eos> Three strangers meet on a dive trip, and five years later, a cartel assassin kills them all.<eos> Why?<eos> How fast can you get me to Mexico?<eos> We find out who else was on that dive trip, we find Suarez's next target, and that gets us Suarez.<eos> Brown.<eos> Detective Brown, this is Special Agent Rose Nolan with the FBI.<eos> I've just sent you a file.<eos> Did you receive it?
We split it up.<eos> We figured the dead guy wouldn't miss it.<eos> And... anybody who knew about it would assume that it had burnt up in a fire.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Only it was cartel money.<eos> They don't assume and they don't forget.<eos> They probably went over every inch of that wreckage.<eos> They knew someone took their money.<eos> And here we are, five years later, and they've tracked you down.<eos> My... my... my son, he said we shouldn't take it.
Yeah.<eos> It's working.<eos> They're coming back.<eos> We did it.<eos> Mason Rutledge, you have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say...<eos> No!<eos> What the hell did you do? !<eos> He had a knife!<eos> I saw it!
And are you taking anything for the pain?<eos> Uh, just naproxen.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is the discomfort worse at night?<eos> A little bit, but the medicine helps.<eos> Well, for what it's worth, I think Dr. Campbell's right.<eos> You should make a full recovery.<eos> In case you were wondering, Watson,<eos> Mr. Abramovitch does not have an alibi for the night of Abby Campbell's murder.<eos> I don't think he did it.
Amy broke up with Sheldon, she got her ears pierced and she made us eat penis cookies!<eos> Hang on.<eos> She wants to talk to you.<eos> I don't think the lever's working.<eos> What makes you say that?<eos> There's gotta be something else we could try.<eos> If this was Star Trek, we could use a phaser to blast it off.<eos> No, it's too broad of a beam.<eos> You'd need something more precise, like Superman's heat vision.<eos> Ooh, the Green Lantern's ring could make a big green hand that unscrews it.
So, if I remember anything, should I call you, or...<eos> You can call me.<eos> I'm the detective on the case.<eos> She works in the morgue.<eos> You're like that box of chocolates from Forrest Gump,<eos> I never know what I'm gonna get.<eos> You're getting chocolate, bro.<eos> I'll start calling the local costume shops.<eos> See if I can find the ones that stock that blue furry costume.<eos> Find out who rented it.
Yeah, it was, like, a discipline hearing-type thing.<eos> This kid looked like he wanted to murder Chad, bro.<eos> We've gotta find this other student.<eos> Pronto.<eos> Brain fart.<eos> Whole new level.<eos> So I finally found out the blue bear is a character from a Swedish kids' show named Captain Wozzles.<eos> He did look Nordic.<eos> I called every costume shop here in Seattle.<eos> So far, no one carries it.
All four victims are missing teeth and fingernails.<eos> The detective on the case thinks someone was sending a message.<eos> And this is the guy who sold you and Major Utopium at the club?<eos> I buy drugs one time, purely for research purposes, and this is what happens.<eos> How bad must my karma be?<eos> Ever think it was his karma?<eos> Hey, I haven't been able to reach you.<eos> Oh. Someone ran over my phone.<eos> I found a shop in Tacoma that carries our elusive costume.<eos> Got a name for the girl who rented it the night of the frat party.

Someone ran over my phone.<eos> I found a shop in Tacoma that carries our elusive costume.<eos> Got a name for the girl who rented it the night of the frat party.<eos> Apparently, she rented it for her boyfriend.
You think it was me?<eos> Cause I haven't been to a frat party ever in my life.<eos> We just moved here from Spokane a few months ago.<eos> Can you tell us where you were two nights ago?<eos> Around 10 p.m.?<eos> I was at home with Becky.<eos> We were just hanging out at home.<eos> He was with me all night.<eos> I swear.<eos> So, you rented the costume, and then just stayed home and didn't use it?
Hi. That's always nice to hear.<eos> What is?<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> I'm sorry, I thought you said that you loved the show.<eos> Oh, I did not.<eos> - Are you kidding me, Lacoste?<eos> - Where is this even coming from?<eos> Guys, it's okay.<eos> She didn't like the show.<eos> But out of curiosity, Ms. Lacoste, what exactly didn't you like about it?
We need to catch this guy.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Okay.<eos> I just have to pay for the boys' breakfast and lunch with one of my kidneys.<eos> You should be prepared.<eos> It's possible he may have suffered some neurological damage.<eos> So, we got a hit on Zac's phone.<eos> 57th and 3rd for about 30 seconds just after 2:00 p.m.<eos> Patrol combed the area, but the signal was long gone.<eos> Bet you someone just switched it on to get something off the phone and then switched it off right away so that we couldn't track him down.
Slowly, slowly.<eos> Put it down.<eos> Slowly. All right?<eos> Remote's down!<eos> Laura, stay back!<eos> The blades!<eos> We're losing the drone.<eos> Laura, no!<eos> We need it intact. Hey! Ha!<eos> - Shortstop's still got it.
Never better.<eos> Because I know how to win Beckett back.<eos> Is she wanting to be won back?<eos> When we first met, it was my roguish charm that caused Beckett to drop her guard, but it was my sherlockian skills that made her fall in love with me.<eos> I just have to solve a few cases with her to show her that, together, we are still magic.<eos> Richard, you do know that you cannot just barge your way into the precinct and talk your way onto a case anymore.<eos> I am a licensed private investigator.<eos> I don't need a precinct to solve a case.<eos> Now, this tattoo was on the body of a dead convict found in Central Park.<eos> I know I've seen it somewhere before.
We are not omniscient, or today would have gone very differently.<eos> And if putting myself first means being okay with what happened to Chris Garper, then I'm not playing.<eos> You tell me I've got to be ruthless to survive.<eos> But if that means killing the part of myself that makes being alive worthwhile, that is not how I'm getting through this.<eos> That isn't how we're getting through this.<eos> So deal with it.<eos> You don't have a choice, really, because by the time I take my next pill, the damage is already going to be done.<eos> You okay?<eos> I made a copy of this file.<eos> I can't tell you exactly how I got it, but I do think you should know what's inside.
Yes, someone has.<eos> You have a Craig Sterling problem,<eos> - and we need to talk about it.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> 'Cause if you don't get this under control, you are going to be boxed out of POTUS's inner circle.<eos> Is that even geometrically possible?<eos> And when that happens, you will leave office with no legacy, which, in this town, is worse than being dead.<eos> Have I told you how sad I feel for literally everyone who lives here?<eos> It's getting around that you are on the outs with the White House.<eos> Because Craig is leaking it.
Um, was that in the e-mail?<eos> We talked about it this morning.<eos> You-you were going to go to the mall, and it was to shop...<eos> If you don't remember, just say so.<eos> I-I do, I remember the mall.<eos> And then... then I got that text.<eos> Oh, Alison, I'm sorry.<eos> It has been such a... long day.<eos> I... I'm sorry, I don't remember what your second article was, uh, gonna be about.<eos> But why don't you tell me about it now?
No, no.<eos> Dr. McCord always does what he believes is right.<eos> That's why I love him so much.<eos> Look, you have a safe flight and...<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm weeding.<eos> You... What?<eos> That's what fashion people call cleaning out your closet.<eos> The rule is if you haven't worn it in a year, it has to go.
Specifically $100,000 in federal money to identify existing and emerging opportunities in Cuba for Minnesota's agricultural producers.<eos> Dan Sparks is already sponsoring a bill that would give Wyoming those federal dollars.<eos> Well, that's too bad then, isn't it?<eos> Michelle, I-I really need your vote.<eos> I know you do.<eos> Dan, I need you to drop S.3487.<eos> No way.<eos> I'm giving you my Cuba vote so I can get in there and scare up some business for Wyoming.<eos> I'm gonna need that money.<eos> Well, Michelle Porter needs it more.
I'm, uh, I'm not sure.<eos> Not sure?<eos> Guys.<eos> It's okay.<eos> My drug addict mother had the good grace to almost carry me to term.<eos> Careful, Dash.<eos> I spent my infancy in an incubator.<eos> Childhood in foster care.<eos> And later years in lesser accommodations.<eos> So, yeah, I'm not sure if the name comes from Virginia, but I'll look into it.
- Top of the line.<eos> She's willing to pay.<eos> My guy's in the Sprawl.<eos> Tell him I sent you.<eos> I bet this is where you take all the girls.<eos> Arthur sent us.<eos> We're friends.<eos> So what do you have for me?<eos> The system's owner.<eos> Just grabbed it from his office.
You don't need an address.<eos> You just wait.<eos> With a face like yours, social services will soon take care of you.<eos> What about you?<eos> Don't you worry about me.<eos> I have my hole.<eos> Good luck, buddy.<eos> But mind yourself. It's tough, at the Madrague.<eos> I have the theft report of the 4x4 used by the gunmen.<eos> I'm sure the ASCP backdated it.
Take it easy!<eos> Hands behind your head. Hands behind your head!<eos> - I didn't do anything!<eos> - Why'd you run?<eos> 'Cause you cut me off and started chasing me, man!<eos> Is he searching my trunk?<eos> You can't do that, man!<eos> Okay, shut up.<eos> All right, the car looks clean.<eos> I'll get CSU to take it to the garage and look it over properly.
All right, how do you want to do the interrogation?<eos> You drive.<eos> I interrogate.<eos> Wait.<eos> Hold it.<eos> Don't forget that I'm the reason why we're driving anywhere in the first place.<eos> And don't act like you're not loving the rumble of that 350 horsepower under your glutes.<eos> I don't feel anything under my glutes, and your transmission is slipping.<eos> My transmission's not slipping.<eos> And you know you feel it in those glutes.
I don't know much about cars, okay?<eos> You drive a '69 GTO, and you don't know anything about cars?<eos> I drive a work of art.<eos> I'm a doctor, not a mechanic.<eos> This is fluid from the steering column.<eos> She's telling the truth.<eos> Someone cut the line.<eos> Kerry, who else had access to this car?<eos> Just me and Marty.<eos> But someone borrowed it this weekend.
Very slowly.<eos> And I'm gonna make you watch.<eos> You understand?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I understand.<eos> Clear.<eos> Clear.<eos> OFFICER: Clear.<eos> Maybe they haven't recovered the treasure yet.<eos> Or they have and they're moving it some other way.
Yeah, why?<eos> Geez.<eos> How'd I miss this?<eos> This frame's wrong.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Take a look. See?<eos> Different frames.<eos> When the painting was originally stolen, the frame was brass.<eos> This is wood.<eos> Okay, so the pirates changed it.
In truth, I only came here to see how far you would stoop.<eos> It seems you would go so far as to dangle your daughter like a common whore.<eos> What wrong have I done you?<eos> You don't remember, do you?<eos> Visiting my home?<eos> Years ago with the king.<eos> My family came out to greet you.<eos> We presented you with a gift.<eos> But you deemed it unworthy of a queen, so...<eos> Your sweet daughter offered me her dress after I admired it.
Previously on The Romeo Section...<eos> Eva: I don't want to screw him over.<eos> I want to help him.<eos> Then the best way to help him is to gain his trust.<eos> I know how to vet an asset.<eos> You have an awfully hands-on technique.<eos> I feel like my every move is being watched.<eos> They're not used to me having visitors.<eos> I lost my lighter.<eos> When did you last use it?
You got a smoke for me?<eos> Help yourself.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So, now we got all this surveillance, how we gonna deal with this container?<eos> How much weight you think is in it?<eos> [flicks lighter]<eos> Enough they're willing to not walk away.<eos> That's my lighter.<eos> I've been looking all over for it.<eos> How'd you get it?
Help yourself.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So, now we got all this surveillance, how we gonna deal with this container?<eos> How much weight you think is in it?<eos> [flicks lighter]<eos> Enough they're willing to not walk away.<eos> That's my lighter.<eos> I've been looking all over for it.<eos> How'd you get it?<eos> I found it in some of Dee's things.
Enough they're willing to not walk away.<eos> That's my lighter.<eos> I've been looking all over for it.<eos> How'd you get it?<eos> I found it in some of Dee's things.<eos> Huh.<eos> I must've left it at the barbecue or something.<eos> - Yeah, I thought you might want it back.<eos> - Yeah, I do.<eos> My dad gave it to me.
Is there a problem?<eos> You're still here.<eos> It's my office.<eos> I'm talking about New York.<eos> The photograph in this paper.<eos> In it you can see<eos> La Bonne Pause, a restaurant known for its patio seating.<eos> Ordinarily at the time this photograph was taken, that patio would be packed.<eos> Here, it's deserted.<eos> La Bonne Pause is one of your preferred venues for business meals, and when that business is of a sensitive nature, you buy it out for privacy.
You got Wynn.<eos> They won't let him go on any more excursions...<eos> It's over, right?<eos> Wynn's not the killer.<eos> What?<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because I think I know why I get killed.<eos> It's not Wynn.<eos> This watch... It was my dad's.<eos> He was wearing it when he was murdered 17 years ago, but it was never recovered.
Since Precrime.<eos> You said it.<eos> But of course, we wasted that.<eos> On what?<eos> Stopping murders?<eos> No, by missing the bigger picture.<eos> For six years, the three Precognitives saw every murder in D.C. before it happened.<eos> When it turned out the system wasn't foolproof, we gave up.<eos> The next year, 4,000 people died in the bombing on the Mall.<eos> And they would've seen it.
I certainly hope so, 'cause this whole foot fetish routine is freaking me out.<eos> I know it sounds creepy, but... just for a second.<eos> I know what it's like to lose somebody.<eos> Crazy thing about it is that after they're gone, it's like everything that passed between you seems like the most precious thing in the world, you know?<eos> That's very true, Detective.<eos> Now, we know that he loved you.<eos> And we know that he was gonna protect you.<eos> And this thumb drive we're looking for, he would never put it any place you were gonna find it, because finding it means that you're gonna become a target, just like he was.<eos> And so, if you're him, what do you do?<eos> He puts it in the one place that you would never look.
It's 'cause you think of them as tests.<eos> As opposed to?<eos> Opportunities.<eos> Opportunities to keep your perfect streak alive, uh-huh.<eos> Can't argue with success, G.<eos> Success?<eos> Streak ended today.<eos> First of all, it was a pop quiz.<eos> And second of all, I know you thought of the number nine.<eos> I never confirmed it.
Let me guess, your man checked the car.<eos> Put the money down and be thankful we're letting you walk away.<eos> Cover me!<eos> ♪ NCIS:<eos> LA 7x06 ♪ Unspoken Original Air Date on November 2, 2015<eos> == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> You enjoying that?<eos> Oh, you mean my smoothie?<eos> Funny you should mention it, 'cause I really feel like I'm missing something.
Could have gone to dial and then the explosion interrupted him.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> Something else.<eos> In the last 20 minutes, Ruiz's cell phone received five calls from the same number.<eos> Looks like a burn phone.<eos> Send me the number, Eric.<eos> You got it.<eos> There's no evidence on your phone that you tried to call ATF.<eos> How much money was in that case you took out of there?<eos> I took it to stay in the game.
I thought you said you've been training for over a month.<eos> I have.<eos> And?<eos> And, um,<eos> I haven't actually made it to the class part yet.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Um, I usually have to... take a breather and lie down during the warm-up.<eos> The warm-up?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You may call it a warm-up. I call it Navy SEAL Hell Week crammed into 20 minutes.
I just hope I didn't get in the way, or anything.<eos> Sir.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I didn't let you tag along today.<eos> I brought you with me because I needed backup, and you have field experience.<eos> Okay.<eos> Never belittle yourself or your accomplishments.<eos> You deserve the respect you've gotten.<eos> You've earned it.
Come on, everyone, let's gather around the fountain.<eos> I'm Lee.<eos> Hi, Lee.<eos> Welcome... to the best part of your life.<eos> We have so much to talk about and show you, but we are gonna start with something new.<eos> A ceremony which marks your rebirth into a life of honesty and potential, devoid of secrets and lies and stress.<eos> We have bathrobes for you and bathing suits.<eos> So, meet us at the pool, because today... you're gonna be reborn.<eos> You still have your earwig in?<eos> No, I stashed it in my locker.

If you wanted to kill Fisher in a way that looked like an accident, you could easily rig up a car crash.<eos> You'd just need a remote override of the car's control systems.<eos> And if you wanted to be sure that Fisher was dead, you could even make a little explosive that would make the gas tank go up, and the whole thing would get lost in the wreck.<eos> Brian, can we talk about this in ten minutes?<eos> You could do all of that if you had an electronic chip on the car.<eos> You'd just have to get it there.<eos> Fisher had a Thoughtful Dissent sticker on the back right side of his car, and a couple of days ago, somebody put an identical sticker over the one that was already there.<eos> Now, I think that is where the chip is.<eos> Brian, I know.<eos> We found it under the bumper sticker about an hour ago.
Attempted murder, actually.<eos> I freely admit<eos> I am the contractor known as Taurus.<eos> But in the interest of precision...<eos> I'm an engineer, after all... there's one thing you're wrong about.<eos> Taurus didn't kill Stephen Fisher?<eos> We don't think so.<eos> He took the job.<eos> He planted the chip and the detonator and then he hid a Bluetooth transmitter under a newspaper kiosk on Fulton.<eos> And this somehow adds up to him not doing it?
I would expect nothing less from a man of your talents.<eos> Do people around here know how sharp you are?<eos> 'Cause I could help you with that, man.<eos> They told me you'd try to get into my head.<eos> That's a cynical way of putting it.<eos> This could be the beginning of a very mutually beneficial relationship...<eos> You think this is a good detail?<eos> Babysitting you?<eos> You think that's why I went to Quantico?<eos> I took this job because they promised that if I do it for a year, I'll get a permanent placement in the CJC as an investigator.
Good morning to you, too, Mike.<eos> As I'm sure you're curious, my date went okay last night.<eos> The team and I went through all the candidates for the IDK Technology job.<eos> There were no red flags.<eos> Everyone was clean.<eos> Also, the virus on Dixon's computer was a dead end.<eos> So I decided to follow Dixon's own paper trail.<eos> It's what he would have told me to do.<eos> That one "A" he gave out, that was you, wasn't it?<eos> He wrote my name on a white board and he left it there.
- Well, he did, and he was.<eos> Who else was active in the Communist Party back in those days?<eos> Artists.<eos> Lots and lots of artists, including one named Albert Harvey.<eos> He wasn't super-famous, but he was still very important in his day.<eos> He did a mural for the WPA Federal Art Project right before he was disgraced because of his politics.<eos> Now, Albert Harvey also did a favor for Waltham, the guy that used to own your building.<eos> He painted a mural on one of the walls, but Waltham chickened out.<eos> He painted over the mural when Harvey got hauled in front of the HUAC... the House Un-American Activities Committee.<eos> And then... everybody just kind of forgot about it.
Which means it's in the labs at Claxion.<eos> And if I'm going to get there, I've got to ditch...<eos> Mike and Ike.<eos> Mike... four years defensive line at Illinois.<eos> Possible Special Forces-type killing machine.<eos> Real name: unknown.<eos> Ike... two tours of duty in Afghanistan.<eos> Good with knives.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Real name... heard it once, don't remember.
The super said that you were out here looking through my garbage.<eos> Actually, it's not your garbage anymore, not once you put it out here.<eos> Can I ask why the FBI is looking through my trash?<eos> I'm sure you already know this.<eos> Police found fingerprints from a guy named Arthur Maciel at the scene of your client's murder.<eos> They arrested him, but, interestingly, someone else's DNA was found under Paul Wilkerman's fingernails.<eos> And once we realized Wilkerman's kids still stood to inherit the money, we thought maybe it came from one of them.<eos> But the DNA was from a different family line.<eos> You are the only person in the world who controlled whether or not Paul Wilkerman's will was changed to reflect his new thoughts on inherited wealth.<eos> And if you did change it, that means that each of his kids stood to lose...
Thank you.<eos> The address you sent your checks to... did it change recently?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> This check... the-the most recent one.<eos> How'd you know to send it to Michigan address?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Your last check was cashed at a Michigan bank.<eos> There are no A.P.Y. offices there.<eos> It was from a voice mail.<eos> You still have it?
Colosseum class of 2013?<eos> Yeah. Who are you?<eos> I think this is yours.<eos> It's your payment on your student loan.<eos> How'd you get it?<eos> From the person who scammed you.<eos> I'm a private investigator.<eos> I have a client who fell for the same scam.<eos> Sent her payment to that address, too.<eos> I can't believe you got it back.
No.<eos> You can't make me do that.<eos> They can't make me do that.<eos> Yeah, they can.<eos> Where is it? Off North Lombard.<eos> That's the old substation.<eos> I don't know what it was.<eos> Where do you meet?<eos> This building right here.<eos> We call it "the factory".
Oh, he already did Kevin.<eos> Ramone's amazing, and he has single-handedly made Kevin feel so much better.<eos> No, he's not.<eos> He's not that great.<eos> Please excuse me while I make Kevin a ham and cheese sandwich.<eos> Oh, uh, no.<eos> He doesn't like cheese on it.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I've been making the kid's sandwiches for years.<eos> Kevin said he'd like to try my sandwich as I prepare it, con queso.
And then unpack them.<eos> Because there's no way in Norway we're going to Malibu.<eos> If they don't want you, I don't want them.<eos> Carol, no.<eos> We're staying in Tucson.<eos> We're going to Malibu.<eos> We're staying in Tucson!<eos> Carol, I can't ask you to make that sacrifice for me.<eos> You didn't ask me.<eos> I'm just doing it, 'cause that's what people do for those about whom they care!
And not to talk about you in the future.<eos> Isn't he being too much?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> It's only natural.<eos> That's what we agreed on.<eos> Is that the best you can do?<eos> Expressing anger like that isn't realistic.<eos> I'm supposed to be angry, but you don't want me to show it?<eos> You gave up your dream of being an artist, and haven't had a job for three years.<eos> The man who stole your girlfriend is rubbing it in your face.
Oh, really?<eos> I'll handle it.<eos> Help your mom.<eos> Okay.<eos> Gosh, looks like I'll be going to Okcheon mountain, not just the bus terminal.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You should go.<eos> I should say my greetings to Grandma before I go.<eos> Why is this rice uncooked?<eos> I always come here and cook it.
But they told her that they had no money to pay her.<eos> And they gave her one red bean paste bread.<eos> She took that bread and walked home for two hours through a mountain path.<eos> She wanted so badly to eat it.<eos> But back home... that grandma had a five-year-old granddaughter who had starved all day.<eos> So she endured her hunger, went home, and gave that bread to her granddaughter.<eos> But she thought to herself<eos> "Gosh, I hope she leaves me one little piece."<eos> But, that granddaughter said to her, "Grandma, ah..."<eos> A child that had been starving all day... held that bread out to Seo Woon Hae first and told her to eat it.
When I made physical contact with them, I could feel their bodies rising to meet my hands and they had sort of Donner Party look in their eyes, like I was a steak that they wanted to eat.<eos> I gotta bail.<eos> Wow, this is pretty early for you.<eos> Well, I have a big day.<eos> I'm taking your advice.<eos> - Oh. - I'm gonna talk to Claire about work.<eos> And I'm gonna let the fact that she's falling in love with me be the subtext.<eos> Why don't you just work on the case and let the subtext be that you're... working on the case?<eos> Deb, explain it to him.<eos> He's not getting it.
You got this all wrong.<eos> We also looked into your financials.<eos> Lauren's health issues put you deep in debt.<eos> So once she had her new kidney, you figured you might as well cash in on the rest of Nesbit's organs to pay off her medical bills.<eos> Uh, that's not how it went.<eos> She would have died on that waiting list.<eos> So I went online... and bought a kidney.<eos> But I had no idea anybody was killed for it.<eos> Who performed your daughter's transplant, Mr. Dale?<eos> I can save you some jail time if you tell me who did it.
It's not a big deal.<eos> It is a big deal.<eos> This is a coming-of-age moment.<eos> You need to think about what you're gonna wear, what you're gonna say, how you're gonna slow dance with girls.<eos> Slow dance?<eos> We got that covered.<eos> We've been watching "The Grind" on MTV.<eos> We're working on a signature move.<eos> Oh, well, see, that's great.<eos> I thought you guys weren't taking it seriously.
Garcia's tracking outside threats.<eos> When we land, Lewis and I will go talk to the reverend.<eos> Dave, you go to the M.E.<eos> Morgan, you and Reid go talk to Paige's husband.<eos> Mr. Lincoln, we need to ask you some personal questions.<eos> Are you sure that you're up to this?<eos> Yeah, it's fine.<eos> Just...<eos> The cheerleader costume.<eos> We know Paige bought it.

We're on our way.<eos> My way.<eos> What did you do?<eos> I'm gonna get fired.<eos> Come on!<eos> Okay!<eos> I gotta go.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Where's my purse?<eos> You probably just left it in your car. What?
Ladies, are you working on the Castwick case?<eos> - Because it's...<eos> - Weekend Tuesday, Darryl.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No. Sorry. You're right.<eos> I may not have thought this day through.<eos> Hey, Brendan, have you seen that tablecloth with the roses on it?<eos> What?<eos> Haven't seen it.
Or... you could just stare at me like a serial killer.<eos> Scott?<eos> Scott!<eos> - Scott! - Huh? Huh?<eos> What?<eos> Sorry. We have the semifinals coming up against the Glendorables.<eos> They're the a-cappella group from Glendora.<eos> - They're the best in the state.<eos> - Okay, I'm looking for that white tablecloth that we have, the one with the roses on it.<eos> - Yeah, I saw it.

Later.<eos> Sooner rather than...<eos> Uh, hi.<eos> I didn't know you were still here. I thought you already left.<eos> Oh, I don't leave when there's whiskey left. Oh.<eos> Hey, you know what?<eos> Take it home.<eos> That's my gift to you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, I get it now.
And Milton Bradley's like, every other square has, like, a thing on it.<eos> You know, and the goal is to reach the ripe old age of 50.<eos> And the not goal is to reach ruin and have complete destruction in your life.<eos> - And in the middle, there was suicide.<eos> - Well, good night.<eos> So, he goes to New York with the game, and he's like, hey, everybody, I got this new game.<eos> It's, like, American.<eos> It's not just Puritan.<eos> It's, like, [bleep] cool.<eos> And everyone's buying it.
- Yet...<eos> Yeah.<eos> The table's just, like, a little wobbly.<eos> - Oh, I can take care of that.<eos> - Oh, I can take care of that.<eos> Here. - Got it! - Oh!<eos> I'm-I'm fine.<eos> Look, Jane, there's a four-"cheese"<eos> grilled cheese here.<eos> Actually, cheese has been giving the baby gas, so Jane's off it until she's done nursing.
Dimitri, come and give me a hand.<eos> They've already got to know it.<eos> You'd better go home.<eos> Now.<eos> Later.<eos> - Where's Tommi?<eos> - With Manuel, in town.<eos> Tell them, and then go home.<eos> - Do you want a ride?<eos> - I don't need it.
Uh, he's got it.<eos> Six of them coming in.<eos> Jesse, what's the E.T.A. on vascular?<eos> - Five minutes.<eos> - That's not good enough.<eos> We've got two choices.<eos> What are they?<eos> Pull the rod, potentially worsen the hole, but that might give us a chance to fix it.<eos> - Or?<eos> - Or leave it in and we're limited to external techniques.
Yes, it drives me crazy.<eos> Yeah, I can relate.<eos> Years of mountain climbing, parasailing, extreme sports.<eos> Kind of my thing.<eos> Yeah, see, that pinched nerve, it's not in...<eos> Her neck, no, it's not.<eos> It's likely from the...<eos> Median nerve, which runs through your arm. Probably caused by...<eos> Firing a weapon or fending off potential suitors.<eos> Remember, I mentioned it to you back at the fashion show?
Look.<eos> Look at him.<eos> Bloody smarty pants.<eos> He's all charged up.<eos> Children, finally you've managed to get to class 10.<eos> And just like, one can predict what a kid will grow up to be.<eos> Similarly, your class 10 results determine who is a winner, and who is...<eos> Loser.<eos> Children, every minute, hour and second this year is priceless for all of you.<eos> Those who use it wisely, will be the...

I am going.<eos> I'll go study.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Sit.<eos> Children...<eos> "Better Late than Never!"<eos> You must have heard this proverb.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Today you will see it.
You can prepare for a hattrick in your exams.<eos> Sit!<eos> Weak<eos> Sin cos tita+ tan cos tita = one, my son.<eos> Sin cos tita- tan cos tita = cos 2 tita.<eos> One plus one does not equal eleven, my son.<eos> All the subjects, except math we are dull.<eos> Math we are dull, math we are dull.<eos> By the way, why don't you bring lunch?<eos> I've no one to make it for me.
Give us one more chance.<eos> You haven't seen Annie.<eos> Annie?<eos> Scoot, scoot, scoot, scoot.<eos> You got forked without me?<eos> But this was our thing!<eos> Well, you were brewing.<eos> I was bored, and...<eos> Wow, you sure you want me to go out with a girl who lists sex as an interest?<eos> At least she didn't list it as an occupation, right?
- You used to work for the county?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Back in '06 with my father.<eos> Just after you transferred to New York.<eos> We just missed each other.<eos> Once I realized what a bureaucratic nightmare this place was, I bounced.<eos> You mean, once you realized you could make more money on your own?<eos> To-may-to/to-mah-to.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Everything just like I left it.
Me, too.<eos> I think we both know this wouldn't be a good idea.<eos> I mean, we could... but maybe when this investigation is over, if you're still interested.<eos> You know where to find me.<eos> You know, that was a pretty great flirtation clinic you just put on.<eos> Now, could I give you a tip or two?<eos> Sure.<eos> But once you hit your stride...<eos> - I get it.<eos> - And I got it.
It was donated as a tribute to her.<eos> We are going to need to have the tapestry examined for trace evidence.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, but I doubt you'll find anything.<eos> Well, you see, each new acquisition receives an extensive cleaning and restoration.<eos> Oh, excuse me, one moment.<eos> Mr. Perfect did it again.<eos> Ah, sorry I don't quite follow.<eos> Van Doren couldn't destroy the blood stained tapestry, 'cause it's too valuable.<eos> Yeah, someone would definitely notice if one-third of that set went missing.<eos> But if he kept it, someone might see the blood.
I don't understand the politics around here! Ahhhm! Num-num-num-num!<eos> Morning meeting.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Jay Leno's candy dish.<eos> Oh! If this candy dish could talk...<eos> Yeah, you would have a talking candy dish, and maybe that would have been impressive, okay?<eos> You're not worried about getting caught?<eos> Those rich people have security cameras everywhere!<eos> Yeah, but he wouldn't care about a bowl.<eos> I mean, he probably put it out so I would take it.
I'll get some champagne.<eos> We'll celebrate.<eos> Okay!<eos> This is one of the greatest moments of my life!<eos> I wish I had a... souvenir to remember this day.<eos> What are you doing with my brass rooster? Uh... duh... I have a brass chicken at home, and they... belong together?<eos> Look, son, we all have idols.<eos> I've never told anybody this before, but... I once took a candy dish from George Carlin's house.<eos> I wasn't proud of it.<eos> In fact, I-I still have it.
It's the play.<eos> Bertolt Brecht uses the alienation effect to create emotional distance from the audience.<eos> I don't know.<eos> So, why did you produce his play?<eos> I was completely swept up in the idealism of the theatre owner-- a pipe-smoking cream puff of a German named Gerta.<eos> She read "Mother Courage" to me aloud-- the whole play in one sitting.<eos> A brilliant exploration of the politics of war and those who profit from it.<eos> Sadly, it was 1991, and audiences were going in droves to see "Cats."<eos> Gerta lost every penny of my investment, but she remains grateful to this day.<eos> Her theater is ours as long as we need it.
_ Nasim? Nasim?<eos> Forgive me for intruding. Nasim?<eos> Hamid.<eos> There you are.<eos> Have you heard anything about father?<eos> No.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> The FBI are doing everything they can.<eos> I know nothing else matters right now, but I need your advice.<eos> You're the only one who values it.
I feel it!<eos> [ up-tempo music plays ] take it away! Hey, kermit.<eos> Two things you need to know.<eos> I cannot work late tonight.<eos> I got to dump this possum i've been seeing.<eos> He's disgusting -- not 'cause he's a possum.<eos> Because he's in advertising.<eos> Yeah, well, i hope the second thing i need to know Is something i need to know.<eos> Yeah, fozzie asked me to remind you To read the sketch he wrote for the show.<eos> [ music continues ] [ sighs ] i already read it. I did, too.
Sad. Yeah.<eos> All right!<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> And we're back with my friend, The annoyingly perfect christina applegate!<eos> Um, so, listen, i have a little surprise for you. Ooh! Mm-hmm.<eos> There's nothing i like more than a good surprise.<eos> She hates surprises.<eos> Did you know about this?<eos> Christina applegate brought a hilarious clip of piggy.<eos> I knew you wouldn't approve it, so i went over your head. I'm the boss.
What... what is this?<eos> Got drinks for Bobo and John Q. Public.<eos> John Q. Public?<eos> Why not go with "Floyd," Floyd?<eos> You never use your real name.<eos> They'll have drones over your house by nightfall.<eos> Bobo?<eos> - Oh. Yes, sir?<eos> - What is this truck doing here?<eos> Oh, ah, Piggy got it for the crew.
Oh, and Reese Witherspoon, who looks like she just rolled out of bed.<eos> Oh! Come quick.<eos> Gotta...<eos> Gotta go!<eos> Oh, hello, Reese!<eos> I was just finishing the little pool house!<eos> I'll be out in a minute!<eos> You're banging on a porta-potty with a pink, bedazzled hammer.<eos> It's a pool house,<eos> - and I was bringing it up to code.
- It's Mexican. Same thing as last time?<eos> - Yeah, that'll be fine.<eos> I don't remember. What did you get last time?<eos> - Wha...<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> - So, Kermit, we got a great sketch for Patrick Dempsey.<eos> - Sí.<eos> - Oh, no, Dempsey's out.<eos> We're going with a big block of butter.<eos> Okay, we'll just tweak it.
Really?<eos> Aw, thanks, Piggy.<eos> - Hey, Kermit.<eos> Mindy Kaling's<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - waiting for you in the writers room.<eos> - Okay. - Scooter! - Hmm?<eos> Your sweater's hideous!<eos> I must have it.<eos> But my mom made it for me for Christmas!
- I'm sorry. We tried it five years ago.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> Silk shirts slip off the brass.<eos> Oh. Okay.<eos> Well, I'm just getting started.<eos> Lights.<eos> This model features a hidden tilt-out hamper.<eos> -That's a terrific idea.<eos> -I'm glad you think so.<eos> ...is what Ken Sutton's boss told him when he pitched it in 1992.
Heidi Von Ocher!<eos> Heidi Von Ocher!<eos> Oh, Nein!<eos> Nein!<eos> Ich komme zu spaet zu meinem Auftritt!<eos> Oh, nein!<eos> Nein!<eos> Hmm.<eos> That Web site looks familiar.<eos> Oh, I know where I've seen it!
Talk to me. Lizzy?<eos> Aram, what happened?<eos> Mr. Reddington?<eos> The shooting-- what do you know?<eos> Agent Navabi is en route.<eos> NYPD is confirming two fatalities.<eos> Agent Keen?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, uh, God, no.<eos> Agent Keen stole a car, abandoned it 10 blocks from the scene.
Psalm 1:1. What's that?<eos> "Blessed is he who walks not in the council of the wicked."<eos> The bullet was so close, I could hear it.<eos> I thought...<eos> I have good news.<eos> Dembe made contact.<eos> You spoke to him?<eos> No.<eos> We have a protocol.<eos> He initiated it.
It is completely anonymous, so there's no way to tell who this Arioch Cain really is.<eos> When NYPD forwarded me the hard drive, they told me they believe there's a laptop that's missing.<eos> Reddington.<eos> If he took it, could he trace who put up the money?<eos> No.<eos> See, the person who put her on the site didn't put up the money.<eos> - Then who did?<eos> - Haters-- people who believe what they read about Agent Keen.<eos> They make Bitcoin donations-- the miracle of crowdsourcing turned on its head to crowd-fund murder.<eos> The more notorious the target, the bigger the fund, and the more people who will try it.
Get out of the car!<eos> Rose?<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> Rose!<eos> They're switching cars.<eos> We got to figure out where they're headed.<eos> We got to hope she's alive by the time we get there. Knock, knock.<eos> Hey, come see this.<eos> Is that the video from Chrissie's building?<eos> Still can't believe the landlord gave it to you.
Chrissie?<eos> Wake up!<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> Thanks anyway.<eos> That was CCS.<eos> The kid fried his computer.<eos> We're screwed.<eos> Not quite.<eos> I had the phone company trace a signal on that disposable phone Rose called you on.<eos> The state trooper found it on the street up in Armonk.
- Try it again.<eos> - Okay.<eos> (engine sputters) Aw... Well, well.<eos> Here's the problem.<eos> - What?<eos> - Your car's a piece of crap.<eos> This girl already knows you're broke, right?<eos> No.<eos> No, she thinks it's vintage.<eos> I-I told her I got it at an auction in Pebble Beach.
A lot of fun stuff in there...<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I really love the world of this rap.<eos> I just had, like, one thought.<eos> Okay.<eos> Not that I know anything, but it's a little bit, maybe, too... political.<eos> I just can't think of any other corporate jingles that say, "God is a black woman."<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> That's what makes it original, yo. Mm-hmm.<eos> I just think toning it down might give us a better shot.
Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Last look.<eos> Is it true I didn't get the part?<eos> This is not a good time.<eos> We are about to shoot a death-defying scene.<eos> Come on, people.<eos> We're about to go into triple overtime.<eos> I thought we could do this the easy way, Rogelio.<eos> But, uh, if you're not gonna give me the part because I deserve it, then you're gonna have to give it to me so I don't release this.
Well, I'm not saying I'm them.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> They all got out at the top of their game, didn't wait to be pushed.<eos> Oh, I am not buying that.<eos> And I'm not selling, I'm just saying.<eos> Frank, right here, right now, who are you trying to protect?<eos> Nobody in particular.<eos> Just the standards of this office.<eos> I want that file, Frank.<eos> After I've reviewed it, and only then if there is criminality involved.
Anyway, you were saying?<eos> The Falcon Unit, it's a private company that specializes in transporting sensitive and occasionally illegal items for wealthy clients.<eos> So our victim was a transporter, like the movie?<eos> That explains the armored sports car and secret compartment.<eos> So, what was in the briefcase?<eos> I'm afraid the answer to that comes with a price.<eos> I want in on the investigation.<eos> And what's in this for you?<eos> The item in the briefcase has a rather large insurance policy.<eos> The insurance company has hired me to recover it.
- Where's the painting?<eos> - I don't have it.<eos> Cut the crap, Freddy.<eos> You got one chance to convince me that you're not the murderer.<eos> Okay, listen, I was at the garage, but not to kill the guy.<eos> - I was hired to retrieve the painting. - By who?<eos> Tom Gilliam.<eos> Head of the Falcon Unit.<eos> That's who hired Justin to transport it.<eos> Why would they want you to steal it from him?
Didn't get to the garage till 10:20.<eos> All right, thanks.<eos> Captain confirms Freddy's story.<eos> So he arrived after Mia called 911.<eos> Which means he ain't our guy.<eos> So, how do you want to go at this Falcon Unit dude?<eos> I say we hit him hard.<eos> Guys like this only respond to intimidation.<eos> Is that the way it's gonna be now?<eos> "I get this big promotion, and I say we do it this way."
This is Detective Esposito.<eos> We just have a few questions about the murder of Justin Fletcher.<eos> A real tragedy, but I don't know anything about it.<eos> That's funny, 'cause Freddy Stark says you do.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Well, you can start by telling us why you hired Freddy to steal that painting back from your own employee.<eos> You got it all wrong.<eos> I didn't hire Freddy to steal it.<eos> I hired him to retrieve it.<eos> Justin stole it from us.
I spoke with his co-workers.<eos> He's got a rock-solid alibi.<eos> Well, that makes sense.<eos> If he was willing to kill Justin, he'd already have the Van Gogh and he wouldn't have asked me to steal the fake one.<eos> Hold on. The Van Gogh you recovered is the forgery?<eos> How do you know about the forgery?<eos> Lorenzo, you are in a world of trouble.<eos> Your best bet is to tell us everything you know now.<eos> I have spent my entire adult life searching for that painting.<eos> When I heard it was coming up for auction, I tried to get my boss to buy it.
I made a few calls trying to pull in a favor with the Chief.<eos> In the meantime, give Mouse a hand with those guns we seized.<eos> All right, what do we got?<eos> Victor Cullen.<eos> Five years ago, he founded Peregrine.<eos> - It's a corporate security firm. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Before that, his work history is blank for several decades.<eos> The M.E. is performing the autopsy as we speak, and from his preliminary findings,<eos> Cullen was dead for at least a week.<eos> Yeah, patrol working the Union Park beat says Cullen's SUV wasn't there when they made their sweep the night before, so someone drove his body there and left it.
- Thanks, thank you.<eos> Hey. You all set?<eos> All right, listen up.<eos> Bergstrom's reached out to the other two operatives.<eos> Why don't you tell them?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I left a coded message on Craigslist.<eos> "Missed Connection" board.<eos> It's how Cullen would reach out to us.<eos> Every day, we'd log on and read it.
Yeah, I must have heard that story ten times.<eos> How the two of you survived on beef stew MRE's for six months.<eos> Mm-hmm. The reason I can never eat another steak in my life.<eos> Yeah, what was the name of the operation?<eos> Operations are like women.<eos> You can never remember all their names.<eos> You remember the name?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> It was...<eos> Let Jacobs say it.
That's-that's what today was about?<eos> Kevin was gonna come clean in the deposition today about the protection money, is that right?<eos> We fully understood what the repercussions of this would be.<eos> That's why I made him hire the security.<eos> I just... I just never imagined that something like this would happen.<eos> Listen, we really appreciate your time.<eos> We're gonna do everything we can to find out who's responsible for this, okay?<eos> All right, I get it.<eos> Samoans clip this guy because they do not want him to go on record about the protection money.<eos> But I got a hunch that they did not do it themselves.
I'm not sure, but at least some of it was going to this guy-<eos> - John Messer. According to the books,<eos> Harper was paying him 150k a year to consult on the business.<eos> Thing is, nobody in the entire company had ever heard of this guy.<eos> Yeah, the checks were being sent to an address on Maui, where it just so happens, a Kevin Harper was making regular monthly visits.<eos> Even though the company doesn't have any business interests there.<eos> Okay, and there's no driver's license or photo ID for this guy on file.<eos> No, just some bank info.<eos> All right, so I'm gonna take a wild guess and say that this Messer does not exist.<eos> All right, you, uh, you come up with a fake name, you put it on the payroll, and then, you cash the checks yourself.
That could be anybody.<eos> That bike is customized exactly the same way as the bikes you and your crew ride.<eos> Coincidence.<eos> It's the same gun that you and your crew use.<eos> Look, I didn't shoot anyone.<eos> Not yourself, no,<eos> I believe that, but here's the thing.<eos> This is my problem, all right.<eos> You got a five man team.<eos> When you hit that truck, you hit it with four guys.
"Women, come in.<eos> Don't be afraid."<eos> Hey.<eos> Uh, have you read the online reviews for this place?<eos> Eh, the Internet's so negative.<eos> I try to avoid it.<eos> All right, well, Heather H. says,<eos> "The owner stared at me the whole time and didn't blink once."<eos> Kelly M. says,<eos> "The creepy guy who runs it asked me out, then called himself stupid before I could say no."
You know that.<eos> I have no power in France, I am widowed and alone.<eos> But I am staying to fight for your future because I made my husband a promise.<eos> Francis forgave you because he knew you were the only choice for regent, one who could secure his brother's reign.<eos> There's not a single noble on the council that'd be willing to vote for me.<eos> Not yet.<eos> But you cannot lose this battle.<eos> Catherine, please, no one is more focused than you are on keeping Charles on that throne.<eos> You must claim what is yours, for your sons.<eos> She destroyed it?
Hey, was that...?<eos> T-K? Yep.<eos> This TV is the origin of the malware?<eos> NELSON: Yeah, this is it.<eos> RUSSELL:<eos> Wi-Fi enabled, built-in apps, games, video streaming services.<eos> It's a smart TV.<eos> NELSON:<eos> Connects to the same network as the medical devices.<eos> The target used it to infect the entire hospital.
What's happening?<eos> Okay, strange commands are being sent to the computer in the MRI room.<eos> RYAN: Which one of these computers controls the MRI?<eos> I've never seen it do this before.<eos> I can't stop it!<eos> I think they reversed the polarity of the magnet.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, are you?<eos> The MRI went crazy.<eos> The target shut down the superconducting coils and turned it into a magnetic weapon.
Samar and I are headed there now.<eos> This is it?<eos> This is all you have?<eos> What's Reddington's agenda?<eos> Welcome to our world.<eos> There is something you're not telling me.<eos> Who he's after, for instance.<eos> I'd like a name.<eos> He didn't give me a name.<eos> Look, if you got a problem, why don't you take it up with Reven Wright?
I'll tell the pilot to change our heading to Pittsburgh.<eos> Refueling is done.<eos> We can be airborne as soon as you complete your business with Mr. Reddington.<eos> He's here?<eos> Ah, there he is.<eos> Sir Crispin.<eos> I'm Raymond Reddington.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I wired payment for the fuel.<eos> And I voided it.
You need to put on your big-boy pants and act like a grown-up.<eos> This is not the time to mock my slight frame and delicate features.<eos> Molly was just telling me how she wants to be a doctor.<eos> You never said you wanted to be a doctor.<eos> That was before.<eos> Kevin inspired me.<eos> He's a real role model.<eos> Dad, look.<eos> Kevin helped me finish the DNA model I asked you to help me with, and you said, "not now, son.<eos> We'll do it later."
Oh, now you show up.<eos> Classic Keith.<eos> Hey, you guys are doing great work out there!<eos> Hey!<eos> Do you like Rush?<eos> Do you like Rush?<eos> !<eos> This drum solo is sick.<eos> I mean, you know, good sick, not sick sick.<eos> Although, if it was sick sick, I'm sure you guys could heal it.
But I believe that we should reject our past image as a dead street and build a Halloween destination of our own.<eos> Half the people who live on Highland Avenue are Disney imagineers.<eos> Halloween is their super bowl. Mm-hmm.<eos> Woman: Right.<eos> Look, Halloween isn't about a bunch of imagineers spending a ton of money.<eos> No.<eos> It's about the one day a year when you can lose yourself a-a-a-a-and... and create a whole new identity.<eos> It's a chance to forget that we're a lower-middle-class neighborhood living under the flight path of the Orlando airport and trick people... [chuckles]<eos> Trick people... into thinking we're a scary, upper-middle-class neighborhood that people would want to visit and get candy from!<eos> Ladies, if we build it, they will come! Ohhh! If we build it...
I haven't found much on the shell corp, but they do list an address... A pricy apartment uptown.<eos> And when I called the building manager, he said Scott rented it a year ago.<eos> Okay, so, our victim is an out-of-work actor getting mystery money from a mystery corporation, and now there's a mystery apartment.<eos> That's a lot of mysteries.<eos> What the hell was this guy into?<eos> Whatever it was, it might have gotten him killed.<eos> Surprise.<eos> S08E07 The Last Seduction Oh! This place is so much nicer than Scott's other apartment.<eos> Bet he would rather have died here.<eos> Yeah, but why did he need it?
Stay back.<eos> Just stay away from me.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Javi!<eos> Kevin!<eos> Kevin!<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Your notepad stopped the bullet.<eos> How about that?<eos> Isn't that why you put it there?
Well, this worked pretty well on the rock dudes.<eos> Timber!<eos> I am Groot.<eos> I don't think that's gonna keep the big guy down long.<eos> If fungus controls him, we must remove the fungus.<eos> Okay, problem.<eos> The fungus is all up inside him, too.<eos> And... So is the crystal?<eos> Don't bother.<eos> I gave it to him for safekeeping.
No idea what that means!<eos> And you say Groot don't make no sense.<eos> I am Groot.<eos> Keep Groot busy.<eos> He can't attack the village if he's after us.<eos> I shall do my best to occupy his attention.<eos> I am Groot!<eos> Drax, look!<eos> That meteor must be the source of the fungus.<eos> Then I will destroy it at once!
Our work here is done.<eos> Bot announcer: You've depleted our account.<eos> But I am authorized to offer you a wager.<eos> An official Conjunction turbo racer.<eos> It's all yours if your boy beats our next fighter.<eos> If he loses, the house keeps your ship.<eos> Haven't you always wanted a ship to call your own?<eos> Eh? That you don't have to share with anyone?<eos> You got yourself a deal.<eos> You heard it, folks.
- Hey!<eos> No need to get personal.<eos> I can't fix four things at once!<eos> You wouldn't have to fix any of them if you didn't keep borrowing parts for your useless gadgets.<eos> I wouldn't have to borrow parts if I had decent supplies to work with on this junker.<eos> Besides, who wouldn't want a neck massager for the pilot's seat?<eos> (VIBRATING)<eos> What?<eos> Takes the edge off.<eos> You want me to fix it?
Your favorite.<eos> You get to collect it.<eos> Isn't that wonderful?<eos> Yes!<eos> The final design is ready!<eos> Here you go.<eos> Here it is.<eos> An irregular pattern!<eos> Casablanca.<eos> Do we have it in stock?
Understood.<eos> Here.<eos> The key to the shop.<eos> For you.<eos> For me?<eos> My own key.<eos> It's here!<eos> The dress from the new line.<eos> It's the design you wanted.<eos> I'll bring it to the church right away!
I gave her an incomplete lesson.<eos> That's exactly right.<eos> However... if you had the sincere desire to serve the customer when she came in, she would have certainly talked to you on the phone.<eos> We could have had a long relationship.<eos> Emotion has now lost an important customer.<eos> Thanks to you.<eos> She will never... walk through our door again.<eos> YURI CALLING<eos> The dress was one the bride had been looking for.<eos> When I found out there was one left, I promised I would get it for her in time.

- MRS. AYA ONO OCCUPATION:<eos> GEISHA<eos> Did the boss recognize her right away?<eos> Geishas were rare.<eos> Even so, that's amazing.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Here is the bra.<eos> It's so old.<eos> I've had it for 30 years, after all.
Geishas were rare.<eos> Even so, that's amazing.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Here is the bra.<eos> It's so old.<eos> I've had it for 30 years, after all.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> You've taken such good care of it.
Thank you so much, ma'am!<eos> Mrs. Ono!<eos> Women should take care of themselves.<eos> You should wear high quality garments.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Welcome, Mrs. Ono.<eos> You...<eos> My bra is now so comfortable, even under my kimono.<eos> You've been wearing it?
You can have it.<eos> It looks so good, but I can't.<eos> Here, I got it.<eos> Right?<eos> Oh, my.<eos> -You're so friendly with each other.<eos> -How nice.<eos> It's not like that!<eos> Yeah, they're not like that!<eos> About the October trunk show. I'd like you two to produce it.
-Hello, delivery!<eos> -Coming!<eos> I guess you lovebirds are making progress.<eos> We're not lovebirds.<eos> Of course not.<eos> My shoulder's in pain.<eos> I'm going to get acupuncture.<eos> What's this?<eos> It's for you.<eos> I can't move my arm. Will you open it?
They asked us to deliver it.<eos> I didn't know your shop made them.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And your customer?<eos> Doing final checks on a dress.<eos> She wanted to see it with this bustier.<eos> -Konno.<eos> -Yes?<eos> -Did the bustier arrive?<eos> -I'll bring it now.
It's the customer from Tokyo we delivered to yesterday.<eos> The customer from Tokyo ordered the white Lily Magnolias pattern.<eos> Leaver Lace.<eos> White Lily Magnolias?<eos> What?<eos> Lily Magnolias are white?<eos> I had mistaken the purple Casablanca for Lily Magnolias!<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I thought I'd been extra careful.<eos> My daughter's violin recital is tonight, and I really wanted her to wear it.
Because...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Never mind.<eos> You know, I'm not--<eos> No really!<eos> Never mind.<eos> Okay, let's get back to work!<eos> Hold on.<eos> I think you're right.<eos> No matter how beautiful the product is, if no one knows about it, it's as if it didn't exist.
Today, I'm wearing Emotion's very glamorous, lacy, sexy bra.<eos> The kind President Nanjo likes.<eos> And it's purple.<eos> So, definitely not!<eos> So it's really pretty then.<eos> All the more reason--<eos> Definitely not!<eos> That's not it!<eos> This...<eos> No. I can't let anyone see it!
Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry for coming by during your time off.<eos> No problem.<eos> I have so much time on my hands.<eos> I was happy when you called.<eos> You're here today to discuss bridal lingerie?<eos> Yes.<eos> If you could take a look at this.<eos> One of our customers had this bustier made here, at Emotion.<eos> Yes, Mayu had delivered it to you.
The wedding is in a week.<eos> She's in London, working as a consultant for some famous think tank.<eos> London?<eos> My wife's been recruited by a think tank in London.<eos> Her name is Emi Mizuno.<eos> And the groom's name is Seiran Yoshioka.<eos> MR. SEIRAN YOSHIOKA MS. EMI MIZUNO<eos> I have her measurements from her dress fitting.<eos> She's insisting.<eos> Will you make it for her?

EMI MIZUNO<eos> I have her measurements from her dress fitting.<eos> She's insisting.<eos> Will you make it for her?<eos> This customer's future husband...<eos> Do you know... who he is?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I met Mr. Yoshioka by coincidence at Mr. Yamazaki's place.<eos> So this order, he placed it?
For Emotion?<eos> That was my fault, wasn't it?<eos> It has nothing to do with you.<eos> Emotion was in financial trouble because of Story, right?<eos> That's why you borrowed money, right?<eos> It's something I did on my own.<eos> And besides, it's not like I'm holding a grudge against him.<eos> He's a good guy.<eos> He lent me money.<eos> He didn't even say anything after I didn't return it.
No idea.<eos> If they aren't satisfied with your answers, which they won't be,<eos> They'll start asking you questions about specific evidence<eos> In order to force you into perjuring yourselves.<eos> What else do they have that links us to jeannine locke?<eos> The video.<eos> Ithinkthatgovernorgrant hastheelectioninthebag.<eos> Mostimportantly, heisfreakin'hot .<eos> If they ask about the video --<eos> Then they know we leaked it.

Are you in its mind?<eos> - What did you see?<eos> - I'm not sure.<eos> I saw through the demon's eyes.<eos> - But also someone else's.<eos> - Tenebrae.<eos> They're searching for the demon.<eos> But... if you could see through their eyes, then maybe they could see through yours.<eos> We have to hurry.<eos> We have to destroy the incubus before Tenebrae get to it.
Then take it off broadcast mode, cut off its transmissions,<eos> - so we can call Sylvester.<eos> - Uh, no, the best way to interrupt the airwaves is to interfere with the--<eos> Or that.<eos> Okay...<eos> I got a signal!<eos> I'm calling Sly.<eos> Coughlan launches a dozen drone flights a day.<eos> I should be able to hack into one from here.<eos> Okay, if you adjust its frequencies, you can scan the plane's gamma ray signature, and you can locate it like we did this morning.
Of course I do.<eos> It's the greatest car chase ever filmed.<eos> Then you know that the car McQueen drove in, it is, to millions of men, the stuff that dreams are made of.<eos> Yeah, I'm with you on that.<eos> Not to mention, probably worth millions.<eos> Yes.<eos> And no one knows how many.<eos> And now it's gone!<eos> Bullitt Mustang.<eos> My late father bought it in 1974, and it's been in the family ever since.
-This one.<eos> -OK.<eos> Come.<eos> It looks very nice on you.<eos> Thank Uncle Ahmet.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Enjoy it.<eos> I've also brought your wages.<eos> -You didn't have to.<eos> -You may need it.
Mmm-hmm.<eos> Stop it.<eos> How long have you been like this?<eos> Yes!<eos> So you're addicted to caffeine?<eos> Duh-duh-duh-duh!<eos> ls there any way you can get off it?<eos> I tried a patch. That didn't work.<eos> Why?<eos> I stuck it on my arm,? took it off my arm, rolled it up, smoked it.
But do not worry,<eos> I will never blow up anything if I don't have my lucky charm, which I lost.<eos> You had a lucky charm.<eos> Yeah. What was it?<eos> I had a little camel's toe.<eos> What the hell are they laughing at?<eos> What?<eos> I had a little camel toe.<eos> You used to look at it all the time!<eos> I'm not kidding, he would rub it for good luck.
Erik Barsetto, arrested for vandalism, Your Honor.<eos> Went into the Chicago Museum of Fine Arts yesterday and attacked a piece of art with a hammer.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Mr. Barsetto has no criminal record, Your Honor, and strong ties to the community.<eos> He caused irreparable damage, easily worth tens of thousands of dollars.<eos> He broke some glass, that's all.<eos> There's a videotape of the attack, Your Honor.<eos> - Leave to play it?<eos> - It's a scuffed photo, Prosecutor.<eos> I'm sure the defendant won't do it again.
And this is him dead closer.<eos> This is Tandy dead as close as I could bear to draw.<eos> Oh, Todd.<eos> Are you sad about Tandy?<eos> No, sorry, I'm just thinking about Gordon.<eos> Well, I'm sure one day you'll cry about Tandy, too.<eos> Probably not.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, what's Gail up to out there?<eos> She's been writing Gordon's name in the sand and watching the tide wash it away.
He was safe with me.<eos> Or at least I thought he was safe with me.<eos> The X-ray from the young man with the stray bullet.<eos> It hit his defib implant.<eos> You were right, Dr. Savetti.<eos> Well done.<eos> It was a single bullet.<eos> Looks like the implant deflected it away from his heart.<eos> We have to assume it's not functioning, right?<eos> We need a cardiologist to assess it, and they're swamped.
Make some room!<eos> Is he officially under arrest?<eos> - Hey, hey!<eos> Guys, we need you to move back.<eos> - Move back, people.<eos> Your ex-lap tray is right here.<eos> Let's start the procedure now, please.<eos> You're gonna do it on your own?<eos> He won't make it.<eos> We'll do it together.
There's a glass screen in front of you, and you don't see the person at the other end.<eos> So what you see is a reflection of you.<eos> It's sexy.<eos> Who doesn't like hearing or seeing something sexual about somebody that they're interested in?<eos> The idea of lovers communicating secret little messages is as old as writing.<eos> Sexting, first of all, can be either verbal or visual.<eos> I kinda have a different feeling about both of them.<eos> From the verbal side, sometimes I think it's good for people to be able, behind a screen, to say things they might not be able to say to someone's face.<eos> Most of the sexting that's going on tends to be healthy, in my opinion.<eos> I think a lot of people are doing it to keep their love lives active, and to let their partners know that they're interested and aroused by them.
Come up with your own stuff.<eos> Keep it tight and simple, and always throw in a compliment.<eos> Words are good. Words are powerful.<eos> You don't need a picture.<eos> Words are good.<eos> If you're a creative writer, you can definitely make someone, you know, get into it.<eos> I find sexting to be a very powerful foreplay tool.<eos> Very powerful.<eos> Almost too much.<eos> Almost to the point where it's like, this is so good, the actual act can't hold water, which is why I don't really even do it as much anymore.
So it's kinda natural that that would happen.<eos> I wouldn't do it myself. No.<eos> Nope, Let's just nip that right there.<eos> Nope. No.<eos> They can send e-mails.<eos> I mean, come on.<eos> It's been my experience with elderly people that they really can't even get to their contacts, you know, and their phone very well, so...<eos> Fuck yeah.<eos> Hell yeah!<eos> They need it more than anyone.
"'Listen, I wanna have sex with you.<eos> "'I have to send you a bunch of fucking hieroglyphics<eos> "'hoping that you can understand what I'm saying to you,<eos> "'and if you do, then you're just as fucking stupid as I am,<eos> "'and we should not have kids.'"<eos> I would say now that I've started to enjoy sexting,<eos> I am addicted to sexting.<eos> I am.<eos> Why do you think that?<eos> Because I do it a lot, and I have fun with it, and I enjoy it.

Whether you're on something as simple as Pinterest, which you pin and pin and react and act and act, and you're falling down a rabbit hole because it's stimulating your mind.<eos> An addiction is only an addiction if it's interfering with other parts of your life.<eos> When we talk about sexting or any technology, there's really no, uh, disorder for technological addiction.<eos> We suggest that people take breaks from their devices.<eos> Even turn them off for a while.<eos> Definitely not have them on in the middle of the night, so that you're not getting alerts and rings, you know, while you're sleeping.<eos> And during the day, try to minimize the number of times that you're checking your phone.<eos> If it's not a problem, don't treat it as a problem.<eos> So if people are sexting and there's no negativity about it in their lives and they're happy about it, it's something they don't need to be focused on.<eos> If sexting makes you feel pleasure and you're doing it because you constantly need that replenishment of pleasure, but you can only get it through sexting, then it's problematic.

Hi, I'm Bonnie, and I'm an alcoholic.<eos> Hi, Bonnie.<eos> Well, there's only nine more dating days till Christmas, and I'm starting to lose hope.<eos> I mean, how is it this package has no one to unwrap it on Christmas morning?<eos> The holidays are rough enough without drinking.<eos> At this point, I'd let anyone...<eos> Stuff my turkey... put it in the oven and finish decorating.
What's wrong with you?<eos> ! - I'm being responsible.<eos> - Ugh. Mr. Ambrose, can I see that book for a second?<eos> Look at as many books as you want.<eos> It's a library.<eos> Ghost Boy. Who returned this book?<eos> - It's on the card.<eos> - There's only one name...<eos> Jordan Cagan.<eos> (gasps) Then that's who checked it out.
Jordan, someday you're gonna meet a great girl who doesn't care about good kissing or the law or anything.<eos> I just know it.<eos> Whatever.<eos> - Hey, you're Ghost Boy?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Do you want to, like, um, hang out?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, that was faster than I thought.<eos> Tina, you saved the Land Ship parade.<eos> Well, technically I ruined it.
I just know it.<eos> Whatever.<eos> - Hey, you're Ghost Boy?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Do you want to, like, um, hang out?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, that was faster than I thought.<eos> Tina, you saved the Land Ship parade.<eos> Well, technically I ruined it.<eos> But then I saved it.
You shouldn't kiss that.<eos> Let's go now.<eos> Excuse me, young man.<eos> Why did you ransack the compost pile?<eos> Why, why did you do that?<eos> Why did you stir up the pile of cattle dung?<eos> By any chance, did you rummage through cow dung?<eos> To find this for me?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I found it on the floor, like I told you.
My clients have no records.<eos> They are civil servants.<eos> They are paid like civil servants.<eos> - They should be ROR.<eos> - Duly noted.<eos> Bail is set at $50,000 per defendant.<eos> Sergeant.<eos> I told you to drop this case.<eos> And we did.<eos> ADA picked it up.
Omri Nellas.<eos> One Capital Trust bank.<eos> Sterling Road.<eos> Look, Vega, I double-checked, but none of the EMS teams have anything in their records.<eos> Wait, say that again, Mosi.<eos> There's no report from last night of a stabbing in the Sprawl.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> I saw it.<eos> I saw the medics take the body.<eos> Well, no one reported it to us.
Aziz knew him, too?<eos> Your husband?<eos> - We lived together.<eos> - A one-bedroom in the Sprawl.<eos> You slept on a cot in the kitchen.<eos> How could you know that?<eos> I know a lot more.<eos> I knew who Omri Nellas was last night when I had the vision of him.<eos> You told me that already.<eos> But what I didn't tell you was I had some people I know pick up the body before the cops put it on the books.
You told me that already.<eos> But what I didn't tell you was I had some people I know pick up the body before the cops put it on the books.<eos> Those paramedics?<eos> They were yours?<eos> Technically, Andromeda's.<eos> My associate, but yes.<eos> Arthur, did you kill Omri Nellas?<eos> No.<eos> That crime was random.<eos> But I did cover it up long enough to walk into One Capital Trust this morning with Nellas's I.D. and liquidate all of his accounts.
We moved because we found a school that assesses physical only "pass / fail".<eos> -So I will not have to play the asthma.<eos> -Duncan has never been spotski type.<eos> As you can see, everything went well-oiled Until the first day of school.<eos> Mmm, ass bonus.<eos> Herman!<eos> Damn kids we are going to damn nerves.<eos> And that was it. The mistake that will change my life.<eos> -What do you say, how big were the boobs?<eos> Oh, they were ... Bre Wait a minute.
What's the big deal?<eos> So I did some things wrong.<eos> Does it have to be irreversible?<eos> The heart raged, grew melancholy and confused and toward what end?<eos> To articulate what nitwit strategy?<eos> Procreation?<eos> It told him something.<eos> How millions of sperm...<eos> Men would make love with any number of women even total strangers, while females were selective.<eos> They were catering to the demands of one small egg.
Let's back up and look at what we do now.<eos> These girls are all the same type, they were all murdered at night... they moved in a new quarters in the last year... and they all rented from the same place: Roxbridge Rentals.<eos> I thought the rental place was a dead end.<eos> It's gotta be more than a coincidence.<eos> Someone is accessing the files.<eos> The woman who owns that place has a son.<eos> We're trying to locate him. We're also checking on the cleaning service.<eos> He moves around a lot.<eos> Why?<eos> He finds his victims through Roxbridge Rentals. He goes where they are.
Well, too long, I suppose.<eos> I've become somewhat obsolete.<eos> But you don't have to continue being obsolete.<eos> Look, everything that's happening here is a good thing.<eos> - Sister, you can still be part of it.<eos> - Part of what?<eos> Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble-rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.<eos> You've raised the sisters' expectations.<eos> You've excited and confused them.<eos> They imagine this neighbourhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing bake sale.
- No, you don't.<eos> - Yes, we do.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yes, we do.<eos> - Boy, are you pushy.<eos> - Give me the watch.<eos> You're not going to need time where you're going.<eos> Get it off me.<eos> I hate rats.<eos> They love you.
So... - what are you going to do?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I do have one plan.<eos> What are you gonna do with these guys?<eos> Oh, nothing, really. I always wanted to open a door to a room of people being trained like in James Bond movies.<eos> - Wicked.<eos> I think you should just go get Cassandra.<eos> I just don't think she wants me to.<eos> Let me tell you a little something I've learned about women.<eos> They want you to come get them.
~ I will. I'm sorry.<eos> I will.<eos> .. hitting me with that ball.<eos> Nothing less than all out bloody war in the medium of cricket.<eos> Mr Simms!<eos> Busy? The cricket pavilion always looks worse for wear towards the end of the season.<eos> Stumps and I generally do some repairs this time of year.<eos> ~ Is there much point now?<eos> ~ Now? Well, now the WI are agitating to have the pitch dug over for flowers.<eos> Sorry, they're what?
Well, I hope you know what you're doing with Dylan, honey.<eos> Just lock the door when you leave.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - The Beach Club.<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> - Brandon. - Hey, man.<eos> Just in time to grab your own wheels.<eos> The girls aren't here yet.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's a little proposition I'd like to float by you before they get here.
Oh, where are you going on this fine sunny day?<eos> We're going to the museum for a lecture on Shaker furniture, followed by a authentic Shaker lunch.<eos> Followed by an afternoon of Shaker music. Wanna come?<eos> - Come on, Jim.<eos> - Have fun, Dad.<eos> What do you suppose the babes are doing, anyway?<eos> Oh, whatever babe-like things babes do on a rainy day.<eos> - Probably talking about us.<eos> - Dream on.<eos> Let's do something we can't do when they're around.
- l haven't seen Gertrude since.<eos> I'm trying to pluck up the courage to go down and persuade her to elope with me.<eos> What's her mother like?<eos> - Dame Daphne?<eos> Light-heavyweight, touch of Wallace Beery about the jaw line.<eos> - Gussie's engaged to her goddaughter.<eos> - l'm going to get her blessing.<eos> - Well, I wish you luck with the aunts.<eos> - Aunts?<eos> Dame Daphne's got about 43 sisters living with her and they let out yells too.
You see much of Aline?<eos> She came in once a week to check the accounts, and so on.<eos> -Alone?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -Always?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Always alone, yes.<eos> She's a very independent lady.<eos> Oh, lots of independent ladies take lovers.<eos> They decide.
Wow, what did you do?<eos> Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?<eos> - Yeah. Right.<eos> - I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. But I can't get that hand off my leg.<eos> I'm looking at the hand thinking, "That hand should not be on my leg."<eos> But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words:<eos> "Would you mind?"<eos> Yet women have no problem getting the hand off.<eos> How do they do that?<eos> I don't know. They're working on a whole other level.
The concept of modelling is counterproductive to the fashion industry.<eos> Because when these women are around, who's looking at clothes?<eos> I didn't notice any of the clothes.<eos> We're all applauding. Yeah. What are we applauding?<eos> This is great.<eos> I'm glad I'm here with all these great-looking women."<eos> Anybody can design a shirt. It takes talent to get all these girls in one spot.<eos> That's talent.<eos> What is this goofy walk that the models do?<eos> You know this walk that they do down the runway?
- Wasn't it big in the old days?<eos> - For the merchants, sure.<eos> They got rich, but for farmers, it was just another crop.<eos> Do you know:<eos> In time whose skin will it grace, this crimson flower.<eos> The famous Basho poem?<eos> I read it before coming.<eos> Is that so?<eos> I only learned it last night.<eos> I also read that the flower-pickers couldn't afford to wear the rouge they made.
It's called "The Rent Song".<eos> Did you ever heard "The Rent Song"?<eos> "The Rent song"?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> It goes like this: hey, hey, today is the day those that pay will get to stay.<eos> Those that don't, I hate to say, they got to pack the shit... ..and move, move away...<eos> Practise that, Caruso.<eos> - Hey, Johnny!<eos> I'm sorry I missed you last night I was on the way to club but it's three girls... pull up to me, asking me to take them to the tunel...<eos> The next thing I know, they're going through the tunnel... ..with me still in the car.
But it's been going on for 20 years or so.<eos> Once or twice every summer.<eos> And always at night.<eos> You see, the thing was, we'd dress like high rollers.<eos> You know, like we were from Vegas.<eos> Because you gotta show that you have respect for the game of poker.<eos> We got these big cigars and Frank Sinatra music playing.<eos> The whole package.<eos> But the best thing, the best thing about it was that we'd have these girls, these gorgeous chicks.<eos> And they'd just sit next to us for luck.
- I'm just worried that you might-<eos> - Might what?<eos> I'm worried you might die.<eos> Now, hold the phone, now.<eos> I do start breathing again, don't I?<eos> So far.<eos> As to the psycho-sexual bent of our founders, let's just say that they were very, very close.<eos> I mean, they had a good thing, they were lucky to have it, and we were lucky to have them.<eos> Cicely and Roslyn created the place that we call home, sweet home, so remember them however you like.<eos> They won't mind. They're dead.
What's the name of your religion?<eos> What's the name of your God?<eos> I believe in a powerful religion.<eos> The name of my God is Money.<eos> Now sacrifice yourself for money.<eos> You'll die for sure.<eos> I'm being easy on them because they are girls.<eos> So a money-worshipper has heart.<eos> These girls have no feelings.<eos> They only know that if someone is against us, they will kill them.
He's British.<eos> It's the man's birthday.<eos> Leave him alone.<eos> If Geoffrey's interested... I don't see any harm in introducing him to a nice woman.<eos> - Here she goes.<eos> - Here what goes?<eos> Your poor Aunt Vivian seems to think she's a matchmaker.<eos> In her mind, she's the Chuck Woolery of Bel-Air.<eos> It's not just my opinion.<eos> When I was in college, I introduced three couples... and they all got married.
I can readily appreciate it, sir.<eos> I'm not speaking about knowledge of the form book. I've tested this theory.<eos> - indeed, sir? - Mmm. Oh, yes.<eos> And it works.<eos> I was standing on Eden Rock in Antibes last month and a girl I know slightly pointed to this fellow diving into the water and asked me if I didn't think that his legs were about the silliest looking pair of props ever issued to a human being.<eos> Well, I agreed that indeed they were and for, perhaps, a couple of minutes, I was extraordinarily witty and satirical about this bird's underpinnings.<eos> And guess what happened next?<eos> I am agog to learn, sir.<eos> A cyclone is what happened next, Jeeves, emanating from this girl.<eos> She started on my own legs, saying that they weren't much to write home about and then she moved on to dissect my manners, morals, intellect, general physique and method of eating asparagus.
These tubes often take bizarre shapes.<eos> But they all have a narrow entrance, often flared into a landing platform, which is heavily guarded by platoons of sentries who vet every arrival.<eos> Inside, the workers labour, building a maze of interconnecting struts and plates to support the brood combs.<eos> The resin stiffens the waxy structures and antibiotic chemicals within it reduce the risks of infection.<eos> Those cells that will contain young are first three-quarters filled with pollen.<eos> Then the huge queen comes over to inspect them.<eos> As soon as a cell's provisioning is complete, the queen drops an egg into it.<eos> Immediately, one of the workers seals off the top with wax.<eos> In a separate part of the nest, there are special pots for storing honey.<eos> This is why they must use wax.
There's an easy way to find out.<eos> Very little.<eos> This long chimney is virtually empty.<eos> To find the inhabitants, you have to penetrate much further into the nest.<eos> The workers are continually building, constructing magnificent arches, vaults and corridors.<eos> Among them are the bigger soldiers, their huge heads filled with the muscles needed to power their great jaws.<eos> Each worker places its pellet of mud in a position demanded by a master plan.<eos> How they're able to do so, we don't begin to understand.<eos> They store their food - dead wood - in special chambers throughout the nest.<eos> Wood is very hard to digest, but they extract the most from it by first eating it and then cultivating a fungus on their dung, which extracts more of the nutriment.

- Lunch at the Senate? - Yes, with no hesitations.<eos> It seems to be going well.<eos> Now you need to see her again... just like old friends, with nothing special happening between you.<eos> Normally, after a while, she'll wonder why you haven't jumped her bones.<eos> Usually, where a guy takes a girl to a movie, or somewhere else... it's not for her conversation.<eos> His aim is usually lower.<eos> I have no particular aims in mind.<eos> But these women you date, then leave at their doors... What do they think?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> If they go out with you, it may not only be for your philosophizing...
She said she'd see me.<eos> I wasn't sure I wanted to go anymore... but I saw it as a challenge to myself.<eos> If I could do this, I could do much more in my life.<eos> So I went there.<eos> The owner said she was glad I was French.<eos> Her clients liked foreigners, accents turned them on.<eos> That night I went back in one of my slightly sexier dresses.<eos> Three other girls were there.<eos> They were about my age.<eos> They worked there full-time.
- Nothing. We were just climbing the hills.<eos> - What for?<eos> - To see.<eos> - What?<eos> - To see the other side.<eos> Lord!<eos> Ever since man was born he's always wanted to see the other side.<eos> So he goes to war, has children travels and even becomes a priest just to see the other side.<eos> Are the cicadas yours, too, sir?<eos> They aren't.
A woman on her own... I'll put an ad in the paper.<eos> Maybe someone will reply.<eos> I wouldn't buy a pig in a poke.<eos> You never know what you're going to get.<eos> You should find someone, too.<eos> L've got a girlfriend at home.<eos> What about your bees?<eos> They're better off than people.<eos> They enjoy being alive.<eos> What if they have National Committees, too?
Believe me, you and your uncle have the highest exempt classifications.<eos> Oh, Udam.<eos> I've come up with some new jokes for tonight.<eos> Let's go inside.<eos> Anyway, with the train leaving tomorrow,<eos> I don't think anyone will be in the mood to laugh.<eos> Natalie, it's the reason to make them laugh.<eos> My Theresienstadt friends, I have no heart tonight for a lecture.<eos> I will put aside my professorial notes.<eos> They are neat, bloodless, and irrelevant.
It's driving me crazy.<eos> I've known a hell of a lot of women, maybe sexier than Rhoda... prettier.<eos> Ah, but she's virtuous.<eos> That's why she's so precious to me.<eos> I know this may sound strange coming from me, but... That's how I feel.<eos> She's darn near perfect.<eos> She's elegant... Honest, decent, truthful.<eos> She never lies.<eos> You know women, Pug.<eos> They lie the way they breathe.
In there would be fine.<eos> I, uh... lt shouldn't take us any time at all.<eos> Here's your copy.<eos> Come along, dear.<eos> Now don't bother to open 7, 8, and 9.<eos> They're books.<eos> No matter how you arrange them, he'll growl.<eos> Uh, 3, and, um...4 winter civilian things.<eos> That's sweaters, suits, overcoats and such.<eos> They're mothballed.
I might have been a Chief Inspector by now if I was.<eos> "Were", Lewis.<eos> If you were.<eos> You'll never get on if you can't master your subjunctives.<eos> Keep touching your forelock and we may be back in Oxford before lunch.<eos> - Shouldn't that be "might"? (Doorbell)<eos> MORSE: Not my taste, this sort of thing, I'm afraid.<eos> Nor mine.<eos> The decent pictures are all in my drawing room.<eos> And what are they, madam?
Put thome more mud on my tongue, pleathe.<eos> The poithon oak ith really kicking in.<eos> Vewy thoothing.<eos> Okay, kids.<eos> If we get out of this alive, what are we going to do?<eos> Victor?<eos> Never marry.<eos> That's right.<eos> So remember, kids, when you meet a woman, no matter how nice she is or what she looks like, remember... women get worse.<eos> They get... Older.
She doesn't even know you're alive.<eos> Look, Dad, you're surrounded by great minds up there.<eos> Doesn't anybody know anything about women?<eos> Not a one.<eos> Well, Plato used to have a few theories, but now he mostly just, uh...<eos> takes young boys camping.<eos> Look, kid... nobody really understands anything about women.<eos> And nobody ever will.<eos> But the one thing we know:<eos> They're the single greatest problem facing the world today.
I'm not going to New York, Steve.<eos> Well, honey, it's good for your career.<eos> No, Steve, spiraling down to earth in a fiery hell is not really good for my career.<eos> I know what's going to happen.<eos> The plane will crash in the ocean. Then we'll all scamper for lifeboats.<eos> I'm little.<eos> The big girls will push me aside, like they did in school during fire drills.<eos> I remember those drills.<eos> Orderly exit, my ass!<eos> They trampled me like peanut shells on the floor of a cheap bar!
All right, everybody.<eos> Say picnic.<eos> Did i blink?<eos> I don't think so, no.<eos> You seemed to have changed your mind about ants, alf.<eos> I couldn't help it, kate.<eos> They've made me a part of their lives.<eos> We've broken bread together.<eos> Well, actually, i broke it.<eos> They just carried it around on their heads.
Now, let's all go to dinner.<eos> Oh, i ...<eos> Don't worry.<eos> The tab's on me.<eos> But i'm not paying for brian's invisible friend.<eos> Could you believe the size of that dinner check ?<eos> And uncle albert left a 30% tip.<eos> He usually leaves 30 cents.<eos> What will we do with all the leftovers ?<eos> They may have been taken care of.
You're the fourth triplet?<eos> Well, I know everybody thinks that the family income is derived primarily from the still.<eos> And the home yogurt business.<eos> Quiet, Mr. Pork-at-the-bottom.<eos> It'll catch on.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> Anyhow, the triplets add greatly to our income.<eos> Otto, excuse me.<eos> Kelly, go upstairs.<eos> They sing!
He's a computer.<eos> He still feels.<eos> Sometimes I think it's cruel giving machines a personality.<eos> My mate bought a pair of shoes with artificial intelligence.<eos> Smart Shoes, they were called.<eos> No matter how blind drunk you were, they could always get you home.<eos> He got ratted one night in Oslo, and woke up the next morning in Burma.<eos> See, the shoes got bored. They wanted to see the world.<eos> He couldn't get rid of them.<eos> Whenever he sold them, they'd show up again the next day and kick the door down.
Why, he's too old to be getting married.<eos> He ought to be dying shortly.<eos> - I don't think he's too old.<eos> - What?<eos> What's she wittering on about?<eos> I know what will happen.<eos> Some harpy will step forward, and the ring will fit, and they'll get married.<eos> And then he'll die and she'll get everything. That's what'll happen!<eos> The more the sisters sulked at the prospect of a stepmother... the viler they were to Sapsorrow, their sister.<eos> When their father set off to find his bride... they teased, taunted, and tormented her.
I'll wait for you there.<eos> Asshole.<eos> Pardon?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I see you speak very good French.<eos> It certainly makes things easier.<eos> My method wasn't very successful.<eos> I couldn't get the women I wanted into my car.<eos> Prostitutes, yes.<eos> But they don't interest me.
Every time I wear these boot... I'm never scared?<eos> The wood's, running out.<eos> Don't worry, there's more back there.<eos> Nice house, huh?<eos> A bit big, isn't it?<eos> But we'll get... some chicks to live with us.<eos> But first we gotta clean... so they don't get scared!<eos> This look like a hide-out!<eos> Don't start with me mother... entering college didn't help anyway.<eos> When the chicks come, they will clean.
We've been married 15 years.<eos> Well, what's your secret?<eos> Oh, no secret, really.<eos> Just to be considerate, accept each other for what you are, don't point out the fact that the hair he's losing on his head is now growing out of his nose.<eos> And his ears.<eos> And accepting the fact that nowadays it's harder to figure out where her chest ends and her stomach begins.<eos> I'll get us some coffee, Marcie.<eos> I'll help.<eos> Me too. You know another thing that makes women such a blessing to us?<eos> It's like when you're sitting somewhere, and they come over and they say to you,
You're much closer than Adrienne to my ideal.<eos> You've always attracted me. But fate was against it. Fate!<eos> You control yours, don't be modest!<eos> You're wrong!<eos> I don't like to push.<eos> I'm no Romeo.<eos> The fact is, girls like me!<eos> It's given me bad habits.<eos> It can be a disadvantage.<eos> They seek me out, so I just relax. Means I don't always wind up with the best.
Open your readers, class, and please look at the first chapter for the rest of the period.<eos> Are you alright, Essie?<eos> -I'm afraid I'm not very good around reptiles.<eos> Neither am I.<eos> You'll get used to Essie, Miss Shirley.<eos> She faints at least once a week.<eos> The doctors say her blood is weak.<eos> Thank you, Emmeline.<eos> And don't concern yourself about the Pringle girls either.<eos> The only people they like are themselves.
53 percent of the American workforce is female, three generations of women that turned 1,000 years of tradition on its ear.<eos> As little girls, they were told to grow up and marry doctors and lawyers.<eos> Instead they grew up and became doctors and lawyers.
I'm so happy!<eos> It's not easy sending all those girls back to Japan, Iheiji...<eos> I mean, Muraoka-san.<eos> They all came here illegally, so, officially, they don't exist.<eos> We can't get them out, if we go by the law.<eos> But...<eos> You know we won't be able to.<eos> But, still...<eos> We have to do something!<eos> They were abused by bandits and vile men!
Will I be thrown onto the road like an empty bottle?<eos> Now I know, for when someone gets angelical on "moi".<eos> I'd realized she didn't love me anymore.<eos> She stopped yesterday, or the day before.<eos> When did she stop?<eos> She stopped suddenly like a cuckoo clock stops!<eos> She's stopped loving me!<eos> She's stopped loving me!<eos> All women are cows!<eos> They're worse than men because they stop loving!
How do you do, my name is Billy.<eos> Uh, here's some money.<eos> Please take this as a token of my gratitude. No, it's not necessary. It's a pleasure to help a lady in trouble.<eos> Uh, excuse me, I'd like to thank you properly. Here's a calling card from my place where I work.<eos> I'd like you to come by, and I'd like to buy you a drink. I'd appreciate it.<eos> Yeah thanks, I will.<eos> Sit down, gentlemen.<eos> Send him in now.<eos> Come now, come, all of you. (girls whimpering)<eos> Gentlemen, these young ladies here shall be our newest couriers of artifacts. They shall deliver artifacts to our contacts.
No, sir.<eos> -Why not?<eos> Isn't the other model your girlfriend?<eos> You mean Kei?<eos> No, she 's just a plaything.<eos> Just for playing...it improves the communication.<eos> If this will get me the job, then it's fine.<eos> Itoe cannot make such promises.<eos> He's rather fast to fancy the models.<eos> I select the models and they always sell well.
Now, I've talked it over with my girls, and they don't seem to know anything.<eos> So you don't mind if we speak to them?<eos> No, of course not. I've given the lieutenant here their names and addresses.<eos> [Gina] Did Jan Larken have any regulars?<eos> Not that I'm aware of.<eos> Well, if there's anything else I can do, I hope you'll let me know.<eos> Officer Clay will escort you through the building.<eos> Thank you. Lieutenant.<eos> Madam. Ladies.<eos> Now, you know they're not gonna tell us anything.
National Enquirer, Dan Rather's teleprompter.<eos> Let's see how you're doing.<eos> Can you read it?<eos> "Memory... upward strokes and downward slopes..."<eos> And what's this?<eos> Yeah, I can read it.<eos> - Oh. - Making you hold what?<eos> My breath.<eos> Words make me hold my breath.<eos> Do they now?
Jason said it would be great. It might be fun.<eos> Jason's a twerp.<eos> We could have won if it weren't for him.<eos> Haven't you ever messed up?<eos> I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go<eos> Hey, baby!<eos> Walking with a dead man over my shoulder<eos> I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go<eos> I love three girls at once.<eos> If I fall asleep, they have each other to talk to.
A german put it in.<eos> Plus, what's his name?<eos> Ryland.<eos> He... He threw in a few wrinkles of his own.<eos> It's tight.<eos> That's why we're here.<eos> You know that one of the towers isn't open yet? Yeah.<eos> We've been looking at that.<eos> We thought we might be able to use it.<eos> They don't connect. There's no direct link.
- Open up a line of credit.<eos> - No!<eos> That's it.<eos> No more.<eos> You gonna quit while you're down?<eos> I thought you were a plastic surgeon.<eos> You shave a couple of schnozzes, and you can retire for life.<eos> Listen, Doc.<eos> Let her have some fun.<eos> The thing you do with women is... buy them anything they want, agree with whatever they say... make them happy, and jump them when they're not looking.
What's the name of your religion?<eos> What's the name of your God?<eos> I believe in a powerful religion.<eos> The name of my God is Money.<eos> Now sacrifice yourself for money.<eos> You'll die for sure.<eos> I'm being easy on them because they are girls.<eos> So a money-worshiper has heart.<eos> These girls have no feelings.<eos> They only know that if someone is against us, they will kill them.
The boy is mad.<eos> We've got involved with a madman.<eos> He'll ruin everything.<eos> It's all over. Calm down.<eos> 24 hours before the job, and he risks the whole operation.<eos> What if the police had caught him?<eos> And his hand's bleeding.<eos> It's your hands we're paying for.<eos> My hands are fine.<eos> They won't be shaking tomorrow night.
Now M. Poirot, What do you think now?<eos> I estimate refers to the death of Babbington.<eos> I mean his murder.<eos> Do not believe all that nonsense Butler, right?<eos> Well...<eos> - Not nonsense lady.<eos> Nor coincidence.<eos> I'll tell you what I think.<eos> I think Dr. Strange invited the same people for dinner.<eos> Because he suspected that they had murdered.
no, careful, careful.<eos> very gently.<eos> here, let me help you.<eos> no, no. that's a different position.<eos> back this way, louis.<eos> there. oh, you're doing very well.<eos> got it?<eos> it's close. very good.<eos> well, i suppose these freeways made this town and a lot of others like it possible.<eos> they're the cathedrals of our time, someone said.
They said he escaped.<eos> Valerie!<eos> It's a rotten business.<eos> You always say that.<eos> I'm going home. I'm tired.<eos> I'll check out some more moviegoers.<eos> Drop me at the theater, Anne?<eos> Can't you take a cab?<eos> You talked to people as they left?<eos> Ask the usherettes, they always know.
But I loved the English too.<eos> Wherever I have taken from others,<eos> I have always repaid with considerable interest.<eos> The new queen, for instance, gave me a much deserved pension of £600 per annum in return for a little instruction for her daughters,<eos> Their eldest, the Princess of Wales, she was always kind to me,<eos> When the maids of honour chattered during my performances, I not only swore at them, but called out at them anything that might come to me, And always the Princess would intervene,<eos> "Hush", she'd say, "Hush, Handel's in a passion, "<eos> Handel's in a passion,<eos> As if it were ever, had ever, been out of me, whether it were desolation or idle comicality,<eos> I was lenient with the princesses and they have smiled on me, as they should have done,
Don't leave!<eos> Don't leave!<eos> You must stay and fight!<eos> Keep out of this, MacGyver!<eos> They have a right to leave, Trumbo!<eos> They're scared; let them go.<eos> All right, let them run.<eos> I don't need them.<eos> I don't need anybody!<eos> But the ants--they will kill you.
He has been dropped.<eos> Cases?<eos> How careless.<eos> Where are the jewels?<eos> I do not know how you this should tell you, sir.<eos> The work you usually do.<eos> You sure will find a way.<eos> They were not here, huh?<eos> A useless undertaking.<eos> They were there, sir.
No tricks!<eos> Just stay calm.<eos> Stay calm.<eos> It's only a matter of balance.<eos> Wait, I refuse to run away and let that crack-brained freak win again.<eos> Well, then stay but without me.<eos> -Have you no pride?<eos> -Pride?<eos> I'm a scientist, I've calculated the odds.<eos> And they and not idiotic pride dictate my actions.
Reinhold, whereas you sit down naked and vulnerable before us.<eos> I would like to land a simple question:<eos> What was the goal of all it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't wonder ever why I make it.<eos> It is thus for the other madness that I committed.<eos> I would not like to know the answer.<eos> I have the feeling that I can to write on these enormous partitions ...of 3000 or 4000 meter high, as a professor writes on a blackboard with a chalk.<eos> But I don't only make that to write these lines ...of the imaginary lines, I live these lines.<eos> I also have the impression that after, these lines remain there even though I am the only one to can to feel them, to see them that I live them and nobody else be able to ever see them but they are there and them will remain forever there.
Oh, sponger!<eos> Olya, tell your mother the truth!<eos> Did your old man buy any pigeons?<eos> - Hey, do you hear?<eos> I am talking to you!<eos> - Yes. So that's it, that is where your dresses and ice-cream go, and your boots and lipstick, Lyudka.<eos> We'll be starving now.<eos> Hey, isn't that too much for 25 rubles, Nadya?<eos> Yeah, go and kiss you pigeons and continue to fleece us!<eos> They are beautiful, the pigeons.
"This isn't a good thing to do, you mischieves, why are you fighting?"<eos> And those guys didn't think twice, just took a knife and stabbed him.<eos> There was an abandoned church, and pigeons used to live in it.<eos> Volodya started to feed them.<eos> He used to go there and crumb a loaf of bread for them.<eos> They would fly around him, touch his face and cheeks with their wings and he would trill with laughter. It was fun to watch.<eos> They were not afraid of him, he didn't scare them at all, unlike all others. I remember that he had a red shirt, all covered with little holes from their small claws.<eos> He was buried in that shirt.<eos> While he was being buried, they flew around his little grave.<eos> And later, when everyone was gone, they circled around it for a bit and flew away.
Lisa, we can't have him like that.<eos> It'd ruin Christmas.<eos> Listen, he's gonna be fine in half an hour.<eos> He's not going to spoil Christmas.<eos> And he's not going to bug you anymore, either.<eos> Lisa, we have to have a talk with you.<eos> What's on your mind?<eos> I really don't know how to say this to you.<eos> You guys found girlfriends, right?<eos> Fell in love with the two girls and they fell in love with you.
- I come every place early.<eos> - You're hours early.<eos> 'Cause tonight's a big night.<eos> Milton is coming tonight.<eos> Remember when you were a little girl...<eos> Milton, Tuesday nights? He'd wear a dress.<eos> He's an immortal! Why does he two-time me?<eos> You got it wrong.<eos> Women annoy him.<eos> He sings, and they mentally undress him.
This problem needs to be fixed immediately.<eos> Yeah, sure, immediately.<eos> Professor, I wanted to see if you could lend me some money to fix this problem.<eos> Hey, boy, don't get me wrong, please, I'm not corrupt, OK?<eos> Hey, Rocío, by any chance do you have any friends you can introduced to Jorge and me?<eos> Shut up!<eos> Pay him no mind, Rocío.<eos> Actually, we're really cool.<eos> Yes, yes, but I'll have to tell my friends.<eos> They're the ones who'll decide.
It was cut off on purpose.<eos> Because of what happened to a little girl named Ellen James.<eos> Two men raped her when she was 11 years old.<eos> They cut off her tongue so she wouldn't tell who they were or what they looked like.<eos> Some of these women formed a society in her honor.<eos> You mean, this Ellen James Society doesn't speak, as if they had no tongues?<eos> No, I mean they don't have any tongues.<eos> The women in the Society have their tongues cut off.<eos> To protest what happened to Ellen James.<eos> You mean, they actually have their own tongues cut off? - Yes.
But they have not made an appearance.<eos> Have not hit the ramp into the ring.<eos> Oh come, Myron, what's the delay?<eos> I haven't got all night Get 'em on.<eos> Where are they?<eos> 'Where could the Dolls be?<eos> 'Knowing Harry Sears, this could be a deliberate delay' 'trying to get the champion's goat.'<eos> 'I tell you this, if it's staged, it's having an effect.'<eos> 'A few minutes ago the champions were kidding' 'with the people around ring side.'<eos> 'Now, ladies and gentlemen they're not kidding at all.' 'They are mad.'
And there's darkness all around me<eos> The door just closed...<eos> Behind him now he's shut away...<eos> Our kisses and love vows...<eos> Try this.<eos> A "tricolore".<eos> Coffee, cognac, rum and calvados.<eos> You must have given those ladies quite a memory.<eos> I did my best.<eos> It's not every day they get a real man in their bed.
I've been indiscrete... For indiscretion or frivolity, I let her read a letter that Maria had written to me.<eos> She returned it to me and said:<eos> "I could never challenge you to exchange letters.<eos> When written, these things should be prohibited".<eos> - You were imprudent!<eos> She is a beautiful woman, with a thick mouth and the dull skin of creole women.<eos> You were fascinated with the prestige of being her lover, but, in fact, you avoided provocative encounters.<eos> I pretended to respect her, something that Raquel considered wise.<eos> When you do not want a woman, you should promote her confusion, something which is not hurtful like a simple "no".<eos> Oporto is particularly tolerant of unfaithful women as long as they are intelligent enough not to prefer the lover to her duties before society.
I disagree with 'raped and strangled',<eos> But I agree with 'strangled and raped'. I agree... maybe.<eos> You should be careful.<eos> In my case, it's not important... but you have to ask questions in the correct order.<eos> What?<eos> Closing up?<eos> Perhaps the girl led you to the dunes...<eos> True... The young sluts of today... grow to become big sluts... and later, old sluts!<eos> You're obsessed with sluts!<eos> They don't interest me.
I should never have read this paper...<eos> Anyway, we knew it's just lies in the papers bullshit from politicians just to upset people...<eos> Well, with all that, old man, you've made me late...<eos> The hour is the hour and... it's the hour of the "perniflard"...<eos> I'm going to pour myself a wee drop... if the smell doesn't bother you, with your diet...<eos> Hey, "Le Glaude"... my water, without boasting... it's the best around here... for soup...and for the "perniflard"!<eos> There is underneath a phreatic layer... there's nothing like it in the whole region...<eos> When I think you got rid of your well for tap water I want to crawl out of my pants in reverse!<eos> But you know perfectly well that my Francine wanted it on the sink...<eos> Women, they need the latest modern comforts these days...

And see how they affect your average living organism.<eos> Might even tell us how our Average Joe Cockroach managed to Hulk out into Skeletor Roach over there.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Play that one back again.<eos> Loop it.<eos> Look at these guys !<eos> The brown ones are getting awfully agitated.<eos> The brown ones are from the ship, right ?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And the white ones are our controls, but they're not affected.
Our queen mother!<eos> We would like to get married.<eos> My kingdom belongs to you too.<eos> My palaces are open to you.<eos> Except for the one that is closed.<eos> You shall not seek its secret!<eos> There was a big banquet for the wedding.<eos> In love and peace until they died.<eos> Because the new wives were very curious.<eos> Despite the king's forbidding, they broke the padlock of the 77 dragons.
That's the way you gotta do it.<eos> - The pants are a little tight.<eos> - They're supposed to be tight.<eos> - You can see my equipment. - Sexy.<eos> It's all right, man.<eos> - You're making a statement here.<eos> - I'm sayin' something.<eos> You're saying something. You've been out of circulation a long time.<eos> The women are liberated now.<eos> They're coming on strong. You gotta come on strong.

Draculea is coming!<eos> Get out of my way!<eos> Protech us, Your Holiness!<eos> We are inside the holy church, your highness.<eos> They should have come to the holy church before, not after!<eos> You shall not kill!<eos> Love thy neighbour as you love yourself, lead his soul towards the right way<eos> I have to lead the country towards the right way.<eos> Your Holiness should take care of the souls.<eos> They are the business of every shepherd.
He is weaker than I thought if he thinks he can stop me like that. Time has come. Don't let them rest.<eos> We must haress them.<eos> Let's shake the faith in their own strength.<eos> Yunuss Bey and his soldiers.<eos> They have been hanging here for an year.<eos> "Yunus Bey, do you remember Vlad?<eos> My father's former hostage."<eos> "I stayed around him, Master."<eos> The trenches around their camp get smaller and smaller. So we can easily pass over them.<eos> They are used to our harasses at night.
He's the best fisherman in Texas.<eos> Really?<eos> Then why doesn't he actually sail out to fish?<eos> Why does he spend all day sitting on that boat drinking?<eos> Do you think that's all right?<eos> It's not the right season for fish.<eos> Sure, that's what he tells you!<eos> Look, Amy, let's not talk about your uncle, let's talk about you.<eos> Amy, if you want the girls to stop making fun of you, just take a bath, change your clothes, comb your hair.<eos> They do that because they're sentimental and silly, but I'm not.
But its landscapes had been ruined and... everything was deteriorating and falling apart.<eos> And yet the setting sun of this city left, in places, a few glimmers... of light as we watched the fading of its final days, finding ourselves within surroundings that would soon be swept away, enraptured with beauties that will never return.<eos> We would soon have to leave it — this city which for us was so free but which was going to fall completely into the hands of our enemies.<eos> Their blind law was already being relentlessly applied, reconstructing everything in their own image like a graveyard:<eos> "O wretchedness! O grief!<eos> Paris is trembling."<eos> We would have to leave it, but not without having made an attempt to seize it by brute force;<eos> we would finally have to abandon it like so many other things, in order to follow the road determined by the necessities of our strange war, which has led us so far.<eos> For our aim had been none other than to provoke a practical... and public division between those who still want the existing world... and those who will decide to reject it.<eos> Other eras have had their own great conflicts which... they didn't choose, but which forced them to take sides.
A disaster, a void, an endless night?<eos> I don't care.<eos> I don't want to wait for a moment which may never happen.<eos> Do you love me?<eos> Is that what it would take to prove it to you?<eos> I just want every moment we have left before another centon passes, another mission where I might lose you.<eos> Will the protector of Serina consent to relinquishing his responsibilities to Apollo, the man to whom she has consented to be married?<eos> Yes.<eos> The words I'm about to speak... are the most powerful in all the universe.<eos> They seal a union between this man and this woman... which is not only for now but for all the eternities.
They never fought.<eos> They were always together.<eos> It's going to take him a long time to get over it.<eos> I think he blames himself.<eos> Why do you say that, Mrs Lowery?<eos> He was supposed to go to the party with them, but the restaurant called.<eos> He always needs extra pocket money for his records.<eos> He... He could have saved her... ..had he finished at the restaurant... ..just a few minutes earlier.<eos> I'm not sure I follow exactly what you're trying to say, ma'am.<eos> After work he went to get the girls, but they'd already left.

- ln the streets!<eos> Before that, you had gone to Paul Gaddis's apartment. ls that right?<eos> Yes.<eos> That's right.<eos> - What time was it then?<eos> - lt was before 1 1 o'clock, I think.<eos> - How long did you stay?<eos> - Not very long.<eos> Paul told me the girls had just left, so I went looking for them.<eos> It was raining, so I went back to Paul's,... ..in case they'd changed their minds,... ..because of the rain.
Very ingenious, Lieutenant.<eos> But I say, a bit skimpy in a court of law.<eos> Yes, sir, but I think I handled that.<eos> It's these other bottles.<eos> Your personal bottles.<eos> This one is from the Irish pub.<eos> This one is from the place we went to last night, before we came here.<eos> And like I said, this one is from Mr. Pauley's hotel room.<eos> Now, do you notice anything special about these three bottles?<eos> They are, alas, empty.
To stop the ship.<eos> You knew.<eos> That was a very clever plan, Mr. Devlin, the way you handled the guns.<eos> Very clever.<eos> I never would've figured it out, if it wasn't for Mrs. O'Connell's needlepoint.<eos> Kate's needlepoint?<eos> The guns, they aren't aboard the ship at all.<eos> Not yet, sir.<eos> The guns aren't aboard the ship yet.<eos> They're still on the tug.

In a viking grave.<eos> You can't open old graves.<eos> It laid beside it in the moss.<eos> It took a month to clean it.<eos> It is still dirty.<eos> - It's a secret.<eos> It's Dor-Erik's horn.<eos> - Why do you make up stuff?<eos> I have tried it on the cows.<eos> They walked backwards and peed, as when they're about to fuck.
He dies in a battle in Estonia.<eos> His soldiers brought him here on midsummers eve.<eos> You can't be sure.<eos> Nobody really knows.<eos> Four priestesses came to this place to mourn him.<eos> Their dance became wilder and wilder.<eos> And at midnight they stopped and started fucking staves and stones.<eos> The dancing and fucking got more frantic.<eos> They screamed higher and higher, their tits heaved and from their pussies came the juices of love.<eos> They fucked staves on the ground, up and down, faster and faster.

You'd best hear it from my younger daughter.<eos> Why did your daughter move out from her home?<eos> I was ill at the time and she moved in to take care of me.<eos> She wouldn't have left him but then she found out that during her absence he was bringing home women while she was nursing me and indulged in fornication with them.<eos> When she was absent, he was fornicating other women while she looked after her ill mother.<eos> - Correct.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Did he buy the maid presents?<eos> Yes. To make her tell tales.<eos> He also bribed the children, but they refused.
And in that case, failure can lead to catastrophic result.<eos> That's why, for example, the particular way our eight inventions fit together behind me here, matters.<eos> If one of them fails, the triggering effect of that failure could lead to a rather particular kind of chain reaction.<eos> They're in a B-52.<eos> This bomber stands for the interdependent world we have made for ourselves, where the rate of change accelerates every second, because every one of man's inventions acts like a trigger, to cause change.<eos> This was the first great trigger of change: the plough.<eos> It appeared maybe 7.000 years ago, and when it did, it gave people the chance to grow enough grain, not just to survive, but to provide a surplus to support craftsmen.<eos> And, that triggered the beginnings of civilization.<eos> With enough food, the population expanded, every year.<eos> Small villages sprang up, and they too grew larger with the population.
There were thoudands of them.<eos> There one practically in every village.<eos> The main use they were put to was grinding flour for bread.<eos> And you only had to put your hand into a fast flowing river to feel the power source operating.<eos> By the industrial revolution, you have to understand how steam power worked, and air pressure, and what mechanical engineering was all about.<eos> And the rate of change was accelerating.<eos> By the end of the 19th century, things were different again.<eos> Now, to undestand why change occurred, you had to understand the scientific theory;<eos> and especially the laws of physics and chemistry.<eos> I'd like to show you how, at various levels, if you don't understand how those laws operate, then what they do, is several times removed from your comprehension.
Here's your beauty.<eos> Let's go, my child.<eos> - Does it hurt?<eos> - No, not too much.<eos> At early dawn it's such a fun To go dating with the sun,<eos> To sing Earth praises so wonderful And breathe in odors of the night.<eos> Whoever said that life is beautiful<eos> Was, in a sense, mostly right.<eos> Take just one look at human hands.<eos> What they create, eternally stands.
-Fags? -Yeah.<eos> -Leprechauns shouldn't smoke. -BOY:<eos> I'm not a leprechaun.<eos> -Hey, have you got any sisters? -BOY:<eos> Yeah.<eos> -How many?<eos> -Three.<eos> That's one each.<eos> It's not.<eos> They wouldn't go out with yous.
If you are finished, sirs... I would like to make you a proposition.<eos> In conjunction with my medical practice, I am in a new business.<eos> Headstones?<eos> I understand you are trying to prevent the marriage of Private McShane and a Miss Soong Hi.<eos> - What's it to you?<eos> - I am prepared to offer each of you $250... - if you okay her physical.<eos> - Just what business are you in?<eos> Marriage broker.<eos> I arrange matches between Korean girls and G.I. S... to enable the girls to go to your wonderful stateside.<eos> Where they, uh...
What shall we do?<eos> They're sleeping.<eos> Sleeping.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> What?<eos> - Where're you going?<eos> - You've scared me, the devils.<eos> Where're the girls?<eos> They're sleeping there. What about you?
You, and your father and I lived nearby.<eos> You didn't know that she was also living with us. She was locked up, ...hidden away for eternity at the age of 16.<eos> At night, she would escape.<eos> One evening, you met her in these ruins.<eos> I knew it.<eos> You lied to me. I knew that meeting really happened, that she was real.<eos> Like vampires, like the living dead.<eos> Vampirism is a terrible affliction. The little girl infected several people. Our relatives, our friends.<eos> But it was already too late.<eos> Four other young girls had become monsters too. When night fell on the fields, ...they would attack and kill anyone who approached the ruins.
Sometimes, we could hear their victims' screams from afar.<eos> Little Jennifer would take them into the castle and lead them to their horrible fate.<eos> Then, one day, ...I plucked up enough courage and I tried to kill her.<eos> I drove a stake through her heart.<eos> But I had to sever her head from her body, ...and I wasn't brave enough to do that. So I entombed her in these ruins. Alive.<eos> Locked away for eternity.<eos> We couldn't bring ourselves to kill the four girls either.<eos> During the day, vampires must rest where they are buried.<eos> We moved their bodies into abandoned vaults in Paris.<eos> They were alive, but they couldn't escape.
Now, take a few dep breaths.<eos> Good.<eos> Thats good.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Keep your eyes on it.<eos> Good.<eos> Relax.<eos> Relax.<eos> You have been suffering from these hallucinations.<eos> They disturb your sleep.
Walk all the way over here.<eos> All the way, Al.<eos> Come.<eos> Walk over here.<eos> That Al Lewis.<eos> I don't want to disturb you, Willy.<eos> I just...<eos> Look at all the beautiful flowers.<eos> I'm throwing them out.<eos> They smell up the room.
-I'm sure you'd be.<eos> Do you know how people used to call me?<eos> PasquaIino Seven Beauties.<eos> -They did?<eos> -Because I'm ugly.<eos> You look terrible, all right.<eos> But that was the point.<eos> In spite of my looks...<eos> I appealed to women.<eos> They loved me.
I've never heard this gentleman spoken of.<eos> He is a presumptuous man because when through the telescope he saw the real pattern of the skies he was disturbed because what he saw didn't correspond to the patterns of the stars he had studied in the manuals.<eos> So, he then wrote to Keplero that when the telescope is aimed at terrestrial things it performs wonders, it enlarges objects and succeeds in discovery everything that can be seen with the naked eye, but when aimed at the sky it is useless.<eos> I approve of Keplero's theories,<eos> I have checked many of his observations and have re-done many of his calculations.<eos> If he hadn't died two years ago, I would have gone to find him at Lisbon, where he had taken refuge due to the wars of religion, to receive his approval.<eos> The orbits of the planets are ellipses, of which the sun occupies one of the two focuses.<eos> When Keplero made his first calculations, drawing on the observations of his master Tico Brahe, he made just one error which he any way corrected:<eos> he had taken ellipses for ovals.<eos> Keplero's highly original idea was that of representing the observations about the paths of the stars as if they had been observed by watching them from the sun , rather than from the earth.
I regret that, because I learned from Mr Wigens your doctrines about the correct use of intelligence and I find them very practical.<eos> I appreciate Mr Reigne at Dventer very much.<eos> And do you appreciate them sir?<eos> Tell the truth to Mr Descartes, repeat to him what you told me.<eos> I'm embarrassed.<eos> I don't see why.<eos> They seem to me to be the fruit of immeasurable arrogance.<eos> It is as if you want to free human reason from its dependence on its creator and on the Bible to which you make absolutely no reference.<eos> Many people have chided me for this, and yet I can assure you sir, that I work in all humility, looking inside things,<eos> because I believe things to be the creatures of God and that they bring the sign of truth , whilst the wild fantasies of the men from whom so many obscure doctrines are born are the fruit of arrogance.
- Yes, yes.<eos> Papa.<eos> Papa!<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Come in! Quick!<eos> I think they liked us!<eos> Excuse me, who are you?<eos> _BAR_'m the father.<eos> So these charming talented creatures are yours?<eos> Yes, they grew up without their mother.

"Even if you have to work all night, you'll put it all in the shed."<eos> It was too heavy, I only moved half of it.<eos> Was I supposed to overstrain myself?<eos> So I gave up, and I ran back here.<eos> Yes, Vardo, whatever you tried, it didn't get us anywhere.<eos> Every hand is against us, even the hand of God.<eos> Don't blame the Almighty, Pavle!<eos> He looks down even on poor people like us.<eos> And why should a man with two daughters like yours complain?<eos> One of these days they may get the better of the Czar's children.
The discipline comprises 73 chapters.<eos> We are strict about... adultery, murder and theft.<eos> Can you promise you'll follow these principles?<eos> Yes.<eos> If you break the rules, you'll be punished.<eos> I'll explain about our garments.<eos> The white means innocence, the black, asceticism.<eos> The asceticism to follow the principles is the only way for us to attain the privilege of the brides.<eos> This room is for the choir nuns.<eos> They're of a higher rank than assistant nuns.
Papa very old.<eos> Mama very sick.<eos> Any brothers or sisters?<eos> No brother.<eos> Five sisters.<eos> -Five?<eos> Five sisters.<eos> Ali smallest.<eos> All sisters older.<eos> And they're all still in Morocco?
Go on.<eos> Won't you sit down, please, ma'am?<eos> Mama, this is Mary Ransom.<eos> I think she likes you.<eos> Ain't nothing to be afraid of, Mary.<eos> Shoot, we do all the things we used to do.<eos> Why, the ladies here... they play bridge out on the porch.<eos> We laugh and eat.<eos> There's practical considerations, too.<eos> They help with maintenance.
I'm, uh, gonna go have a talk with this guy.<eos> [ Scoffs ]<eos> You do that. I've still got a few good years left.<eos> Wait!<eos> [ Typhoon ] Show a little more dedication!<eos> Dedication? To eggs?<eos> [ Typhoon ] But they won't always be eggs!<eos> But you'll always be a grump, and I'm stuck here until those stupid things hatch!<eos> [ Typhoon ] And when they hatch, they'll have feelings.<eos> They all know you don't fight!
I see the world with different eyes.<eos> Have you seen how beautiful a bull is?<eos> Until now, I never thought to look.<eos> I didn't even notice the weather:<eos> is it winter or summer? Sunshine or rain?<eos> Now I'm happy.<eos> Give him food.<eos> Go feed the doves.<eos> Just go.<eos> Just feed the doves. Maybe they'll accept it, even from you.
Free enterprise, you dig?<eos> Now, this organization would kind of close that off.<eos> I mean, in all respect to your idea, Bell.<eos> Some dudes got big stables.<eos> Does that mean they get more turf?<eos> The organization will see that everyone is satisfied.<eos> Then there's another problem.<eos> - My bitches.<eos> - You sayin' you can't control your bitches?<eos> What I'm sayin' is... they deserve any area they can control.
"How'd you meet her, son?"<eos> "Well, uh, uh, Dad, um, "she was up on two counts of possession and loitering for the purposes of prostitution... and I was prosecuting her. "<eos> Come on, Cora.<eos> You were also a model before you decided to save the world.<eos> Listen, I'm not tryin' to save the world.<eos> I'm just tryin' to help a few girls.<eos> - How about helping me?<eos> - Try and understand this.<eos> Right now, I'm believable.<eos> I mean, they know I've been through everything they've been through.
Shakin'.<eos> I was always lookin' for girls.<eos> My kids, they're all grown up now.<eos> My brother, Marco, he's a college graduate.<eos> Communist.<eos> Couldn't keep a job.<eos> Too many big ideas.<eos> Reads too much.<eos> I say let the girls read.<eos> They love to read.
The best way to judge Munch's picture is to see it at a distance.<eos> Andreas Aubert, art historian and critic.<eos> The colours and contours appear most clearly on cloudy days.<eos> If one really wants to get a better impression of this extremely strange painting, one should look at it like this, between two fingers.<eos> At some point in this period of his life<eos> Edvard Munch writes in his diary of chasing a woman through the streets whom he believes to be Mrs Heiberg.<eos> I'm faltering. I think I am falling.<eos> But he has been lured into throwing away his talent in such a useless way and encouraged to follow this path which leads nowhere.<eos> I have no feeling in my legs.<eos> They won't carry me.
As an experiment, I visited your Earth and tried to teach peaceful ways.<eos> I left, intending to return when I was summoned.<eos> But you never sent for me.<eos> Finally, I sent a probe.<eos> And what did I find?<eos> Warriors.<eos> But we work only to create peace.<eos> Nothing you have done so far makes me believe that is true.<eos> My creatures here have little intelligence.<eos> They alone live peacefully in the worlds I have to give.
I also came there, from Jalisco, 15 years ago.<eos> What a success!<eos> And I had my land, my animals, and I brought my mom.<eos> And I brought my girls, they were pretty, the wicked ones.<eos> Well here they took them away from me.<eos> They also picked up your wife.<eos> Who's asking you, ox?<eos> Not that yours was faithful to you, either!<eos> The hunger is sickly!<eos> Poor women, they have to eat something!
Each journey begins and also ends.<eos> Then the ending is the bottom of the pool.<eos> Does not the pebble, entering the water, begin fresh journeys?<eos> It seems unceasing.<eos> Such is the journey through life.<eos> It begins, it ends.<eos> Yet fresh journeys go forth.<eos> Father begets son. Who becomes, in turn, father, who begets son.<eos> Then the roots I have are me.<eos> And I am they.

They might have returned to where they landed.<eos> The headbands.<eos> Look at them.<eos> I have noticed that their glow diminishes when the women are not present.<eos> They could be polarised conductors which transfer our vital energy to the bodies of the women.<eos> You mean they're actually draining our life forces?<eos> That would account for our rapid ageing, Captain.<eos> And our weakness.<eos> If you recall, the women seemed listless at first.<eos> But as our strength has failed, they have become more energetic and vital.
But since you're so bourgeois, act the part.<eos> Stay married, but cheat on the side.<eos> It's a safety valve.<eos> It'd be good for you, in moderation.<eos> Even excellent, don't you think?<eos> And it would be easy.<eos> You're surrounded by pretty girls who'd love to be in your arms.<eos> Your secretaries, for instance.<eos> Leave them out of this, will you?<eos> Besides, they don't want me and I don't want them.
Doctor Rutherford,<eos> Lionel Rutherford,<eos> Oh, uh, I understood that Dr. Star was head of this institution,<eos> I'm Dr. Star's associate,<eos> Sit down, sit down,<eos> You advertised for a senior housemen,<eos> I sent along my credentials and Dr. Star asked me to come along for an interview,<eos> I've read your report but it doesn't tell me what I need to know,<eos> Your background qualifies you to set up a fashionable psychiatric practice,<eos> Hold wealthy old ladies by the hand while they tell you about their horrible husbands,
Had you no fear of God?<eos> No fear at all. I wanted revenge!<eos> I lied for the sake of it.<eos> He who lies not is of no value...<eos> Take heart, Colonel.<eos> We all have to die some time.<eos> Should the manner of death frighten us?<eos> Men are only powerful here below and the offense shan't go beyond the threshold of Eternity.<eos> Let us welcome the chains, embrace the shackles.<eos> They get lighter on the path to eternal joy... lt 's my wife's fault!
What about the ladies, Judge?<eos> Their delicate sensibilities?<eos> - And the children?<eos> - The children?<eos> It's exactly what children need.<eos> It sets an example.<eos> It shows what happens if they don't walk the straight and narrow.<eos> Don't get riled, Judge.<eos> I know who put those ideas in your heads.<eos> They don't deserve any opinions.
You are my officers.<eos> As mayor of this town, I demand that you do your duty... and put a halt to these illegal proceedings.<eos> Hanging is the outlaw's path to glory... and much too good for the likes of you.<eos> Judge, I think I should tell you that... in your absence, a town meeting was held...<eos> Shut up, Gass.<eos> ...during the course of which I was duly appointed mayor.<eos> Gass!<eos> They voted for me, Judge, by show of hands.<eos> Our wives' fault, Judge.<eos> They kept at us.
So many little eggies.<eos> And I'm still starving.<eos> And I'm going to eat them all before I go to sleepy.<eos> Good.<eos> Smells delicious, Babs!<eos> Thank you, Cotton. In should.<eos> I warmed it up when I was downtown today... in my own little oven.<eos> Babs, where do eggs come from?<eos> From little chickens, Mama.<eos> They lay them, and we eat them.
- It's not necessary.<eos> - Well, what the...?<eos> Mommy, Mommy, look, I bought me a balloon.<eos> - Terrific.<eos> - Yeah, and look at it, it's pretty.<eos> - Oh, wonderful.<eos> Hi, girls.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - What did you tell them?<eos> - No, they told me.
Just as you did the day you chose the sacred vestments you are wearing now.<eos> Are you seeking holy orders?<eos> Me?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not worthy.<eos> Then what do you want?<eos> I want to be... to be happy.<eos> I want to live like the birds in the sky.<eos> I want to experience the freedom and the purity that they experience.
And you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipp'd.<eos> I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are.<eos> They'll have me whipped for speaking true, for lying, and sometimes for holding my peace.<eos> I'd rather be any kind of a thing than a fool; yet I would not be thee, nuncle;<eos> for thou hast pared thy wits o' both sides and left nothing in the middle.<eos> # Mum, mum! He that keeps nor crust nor crumb #<eos> # Weary of all shall want some ##<eos> LEAR: When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?<eos> Ever since thou mad'st thy daughters thy mothers;<eos> for when thou gav'st them the rod, and pulled down thine own breeches. # Then they for sudden joy did weep # # And I for sorrow sung #
I'll tell you something, Jack.<eos> It is in the bells that I hear my voices.<eos> Not today when they all rang, that was nothing but jangling.<eos> But here, in this corner where the bells come down from heaven and the echoes linger or in the fields where they come across the quiet of the countryside my voices are in them.<eos> Hark!<eos> Do you hear?<eos> "Dear child of God."<eos> That's just what you said.<eos> At the half-hour they will say, "Be brave, go on."<eos> At the three-quarters they will say, "I am thy help."
Just like he killed my father!<eos> Don't worry, I'll manage!<eos> I make the decisions now.<eos> I make the decisions now.<eos> Hello.<eos> Look at the rats.<eos> Look at the rats, not just one anymore.<eos> We've come to talk to you.<eos> What, are you crazy or something? Watch, Mr. Martin.<eos> They do anything i tell them to do.
I hoped you aren't fooled into thinking it was the cat's whiskers in musical entertainment.<eos> No, I've got a mind of me own.<eos> And I hope it stays your own, Rose.<eos> There are dangers being maid to a headstrong young lady like Miss Elizabeth.<eos> Oh, what's she done to upset you, Mr. Hudson?<eos> Nothing in particular.<eos> I'm referring more to the matter of respect. It has to work both ways.<eos> Hu-hu, I know that.<eos> All very well packing young mistresses off to foreign parts to advance their education, but it's not altogether a good thing, in my opinion.<eos> They get taken advantage of.
I've no time for Sergeant's method of painting a face a dozen different ways and then cutting back to the first one.<eos> - Isn't the ear of the jaw line a little angular?<eos> - Well, huh, ha, I see what you're getting at. It...it's very strong of course.<eos> No, I don't want you drawn soft to flatter him, Lady Marjorie. Well, I see you as a woman of personality, decision. Strong loyalty, even.<eos> - You're entitled to your opinion, Scone. - Huh, huh, huh.<eos> Shall we turn him out?<eos> Husbands with great trials, mind you.<eos> They look on their wives as possessions and the portrait as a kind of display case.<eos> - [ MB ] And wives, Mr. Scone?<eos> They don't ever see.
- You'll miss us.<eos> If they're unhappy, let them go!<eos> We're unhappy!<eos> We spent a lot, bringing them here.<eos> - They have to stay.<eos> - To work!<eos> We didn't bring them here for nothing.<eos> Women here don't like my dresses.<eos> They're jealous.<eos> I work better than they do!
60-ryo!<eos> Any other bids?<eos> Sold to the gentleman for 60-ryo!<eos> Wow, 60-ryo for that?<eos> Did you miss a bargain?<eos> Nah.<eos> But they'll tax at least 10-ryo as favor money.<eos> Well don't just sit there sucking your thumbs.<eos> Have one these ladies suck where it counts.<eos> They have amazing skills.
I'm in a rush.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Okay, I'll introduce you to some hot girls later.<eos> So hurry!<eos> I'm here most of the time.<eos> Come by when you're free.<eos> Get lost!<eos> You're getting stoned again!<eos> Leave me alone...<eos> They're over there.
Come to my home to eat, to drink.<eos> Come.<eos> Come to my home.<eos> Come.<eos> Come to my home to eat, to drink.<eos> Come.<eos> Stop!<eos> The ants!<eos> Don't tread on the ants.<eos> They're Monads too.
It would be a pity.<eos> You don't want to ruin her life.<eos> She's your own child.<eos> Those three old hags in Losiny have confessed.<eos> Three times a year they would fly to Peter's Rock on pitchforks.<eos> And get up to God knows what.<eos> - At least it's not on my patch.<eos> - What do you say to it?<eos> That beggarwoman deserves severe penance, but that doesn't mean she's a witch.<eos> - They confessed, didn't they?
Now!<eos> Do as I say!<eos> There are soldiers at the city gates watching for you.<eos> What other news from Paris?<eos> The prison was burned to the ground.<eos> Twenty convicts died.<eos> You and her were the only ones to escape.<eos> - How horrible!<eos> What is horrible?<eos> That they are dead or that you are alive?
But can that be seen to be so?<eos> Why else would His Holiness the Pope have named you Defender of the Faith?<eos> True.<eos> True.<eos> I am a religious man.<eos> I want to do right by God and the Church, and the people and myself, and you, Thomas.<eos> Do you follow?<eos> That's a swathe of folk to satisfy, if it includes God, Your Grace.<eos> It includes your two daughters, Thomas.<eos> - Are they friends?
Only a man like you... a cursed nomad that comes to the city... and seed the idea of destruction.<eos> I hear you pest, I hear you evil angel.<eos> Professor... I have something else to tell you, sir.<eos> We fight together... but in a different way.<eos> Political issues are yours.<eos> My business is with God.<eos> Fine, Antônio... I'll share the enemy with you.<eos> You fight with your courage... and I'll fight under your shadow.<eos> Not that, Professor.<eos> Fight with the strength of your ideas... they are worth more than I am.
You know, it's strange. I've always found that a man who uses the word sympathy is never sympathetic. Have you ever found that, Dr.Boodish?<eos> Tell the truth.<eos> - And I have no regrets. - Alright. - Nothing.<eos> - No regrets? - None.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> No. All I want you to say, that at least I'm right about these few papers. That's all.<eos> What do you want me to tell you, that you are right about these papers?<eos> I want you to say that a girl who receives "Fabulous"<eos> and all these marks shouldn't flunk.<eos> I can only say this: that the teacher in reading these papers thought they were fabulous, but that the total mark involves more than just those papers. That's all I can tell you.
Take a seat.<eos> Are you angry with me?<eos> No.<eos> - Come here.<eos> I melik will play his kantele...<eos> Papa!<eos> Out of my way!<eos> All these colourful labels!<eos> Why are they so high up?<eos> So they are out of reach for...
Then go to Warsaw, and find shelter while there's still time.'<eos> We're short of troops in the country, as usual.<eos> Oh, Michael, your face is so thin!<eos> He told me to find shelter, when I could barely find you!<eos> With three servants!<eos> You must help us find a place.<eos> I do have a place for you!<eos> My friend Ketling left his house in my care. Oh my!<eos> I haven't even introduced you to the ladies.<eos> They know who you are, but you don't know who they are.
Now these sensations are so wonderful, so exciting. They're unique.<eos> I can't rid myself of them for an instant, not even from my thoughts.<eos> It doesn't happen just by being born or living. No.<eos> There's nothing natural about it.<eos> So what do you want? I think about it all the time.<eos> The sensations this love produce in me can be summarised into just one.<eos> I was struck by a grace, something also akin to a plague.<eos> So don't be shocked, if an infinite happiness came along with it.<eos> It's no wonder that I have horrible nightmares at night.<eos> But they're the most genuine things in my life.
But that's impossible!<eos> Wonder what he forgot on the road?<eos> Hold your tongue!<eos> Madam, we need someplace to sit out the rain.<eos> So you want to go there anyway.<eos> Jack, remember, you don't believe in ghosts!<eos> You are a brave dog.<eos> Look - ravens.<eos> And how many!<eos> They don't bother me. However, it's moist here.
I was gonna do it after dinner.<eos> No, do your homework now.<eos> I hear you...<eos> You hear me, but you don't understand.<eos> The world is changing, son, for the better...<eos> We gotta long way to go, but look where we are.<eos> Soon you'll be able to go to any college...<eos> You can vote, be whatever you want.<eos> But you have to take advantage of these opportunities now!<eos> They were paid for in blood.
Why does Claudia doesn't remember anything since her falling?<eos> And why after that period of mental absency<eos> Takes her own personality back<eos> There are many things science can't explain yet<eos> -Science would never explain that -And your students?<eos> Everyone stayed<eos> I had difficulties with some families,<eos> They wanted to take the girls<eos> But finally I was able to convince them<eos> It's logical. They love you a lot.
When you wake up in the morning, that's marriage.<eos> - Now you're talking about sex.<eos> - Oh, no, Harold.<eos> Marriage offers a man the most beautiful moments in life.<eos> You don't know what a family is like.<eos> Nobody can describe to you the feeling when you see your first kid.<eos> It's like... It's like nobody ever had one before.<eos> It's... Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, I'd like to lily your lollies.<eos> Oh, where do they come from?

How did I have fun?<eos> At your age I was already in Africa, in the army.<eos> You enlisted.<eos> Because I couldn't make a living.<eos> I didn't have a penny to my name, unlike you kids today.<eos> At least nowadays people don't enlist anymore.<eos> Idiot.<eos> Let's have a party at your house.<eos> We'll make a list of all the boys.<eos> We'll give the list to the girls, and they'll put their name next to the boy they like best.
No.<eos> Your programme was respected.<eos> I left the sailor at Rabaul.<eos> Dying, he was blind.<eos> The doctors were unable to do anything for him.<eos> They spoke of a rare plague.<eos> You know, news travels fast.<eos> I'm happy.<eos> Let's go and join these ladies.<eos> They want to hear your reports.
It's the summer frocks.<eos> I've had three rapes on my hands this morning.<eos> Is that a lot?<eos> Oh, round about the seasonal average.<eos> That's a nice dress you're wearing.<eos> I don't like his attitude.<eos> I've always had mixed feelings about rape.<eos> I mean, half the time, it's the, uh-- the girls... that have led things on.<eos> I agree with you.<eos> They bring it on themselves, you know.
Too little payment... for so great a debt.<eos> Such duty the subject owes the prince<eos> Even such a woman oweth to her husband.<eos> And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,<eos> And not obedient to his honest will,<eos> What is she but a foul contending rebel,<eos> And graceless traitor to her loving lord?<eos> I am asham'd that women are so simple To offer war when they should kneel for peace,<eos> Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway,<eos> When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.
It is difficult. Hence my call. Slater's there?<eos> Halstead ...<eos> The police!<eos> Why?<eos> Coffee.<eos> A full coffee.<eos> Tell me about it more slowly.<eos> Why does he think it is not accidental?<eos> Yes, I saw the marks, Mr. Slater.<eos> I assure you, they did not cause his death.
- We've never done anything.<eos> - I was wondering if you noticed that.<eos> - I noticed.<eos> Well, is my last night here.<eos> Do we make the most of it, or do you disappear as usual?<eos> I suppose if anything's to become of us, ill have to be tonight.<eos> Thas exactly the way I feel.<eos> You've had so many women in your life.<eos> I haven't looked at another woman since the first night you came into the club.<eos> But they're still looking at you.
We shall now elect the beauty queen.<eos> She will then hand over an honorary present to our former chairman.<eos> Now I ask the chosen candidates to come to the stage.<eos> I tell you, I tell you, keep calm.<eos> Stand here.<eos> I'll tell you when to go.<eos> Comrade candidates, please come up here to the stage.<eos> What's the matter with those girls?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Where are they?
It was kind of love triangle.<eos> - No...<eos> - I remember...<eos> When I read his love letters...<eos> From whom?<eos> So who from?<eos> He was blessed, I think.<eos> I have never received such letters!<eos> Women just seem to like him for some reason.<eos> What did they say?
I don't know.<eos> I think at first it was because I was lonely.<eos> I felt empty, I still feel that emptiness.<eos> Who do you love more, Oshima or me?<eos> Currently I'd have to say it's you.<eos> But I may fall for another man in the future.<eos> What you said to me... reminds me of what you were criticizing earlier.<eos> It's totally different from what you just said now.<eos> I don't mean to criticize you, but... I think people sometimes theatrically produce themselves.<eos> They perform according to that which they, themselves, plot.
To rebuild our ship and create a launching site for it.<eos> We have travelled too many light-years in search of an answer to our survival.<eos> We have not found it.<eos> We have grown old.<eos> And weak.<eos> We wish to die on our own planet.<eos> We do not wish to harm anyone.<eos> Take Dr. Temple to the operating room.<eos> This brilliant brain, these hands were the property of a skilled surgeon.<eos> They will have no difficulty in removing your silver plate and substituting one of a less troublesome metal.
- Women?<eos> -Not many.<eos> We have 2.<eos> - 2 women?<eos> - A Caucasian and an African.<eos> Where are they from?<eos> One is Angolese-Portuguese the other one is Congolese.<eos> - Only two?<eos> - Yeah, two.<eos> They go into combat too?
So much the better, M. Pierre.<eos> Is it true that all the women have left Moscow?<eos> What had they to fear?<eos> Wouldn't French ladies quit Paris if the Russians came?<eos> - That's a good one.<eos> But Paris...<eos> - Paris is the capital of the world.<eos> Paris - it is Talma, la Duschenois,<eos> Potier, the Sorbonne, the boulevards.<eos> To return to your ladies, what a chance they have lost.
Hurry, Booboo.<eos> - A cup of coffee.<eos> - Make it two.<eos> - Leaving already?<eos> - We'll be back. - Taking my girls?<eos> - We meet at noon. Be careful.<eos> Was the fair a success?<eos> - A huge one. - And my girls?<eos> - A triumph!<eos> They made the front page!
You like pigeons?<eos> - I had a pigeon coop when I was a kid.<eos> - You did?<eos> - With this Jewish kid on my block.<eos> - How do you make them come back?<eos> - How do you make them come back?<eos> - Well, you fly them.<eos> - You train them with this stick.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They follow it and come back.
- But, Doctor, you...<eos> Excellent.<eos> Now to work.<eos> It'll be extremely cold.<eos> We shall need to put on warm clothing.<eos> Mr Viner, would you get the anoraks?<eos> - Are we all going down?<eos> - There's safety in numbers.<eos> - The women as well?<eos> - They will stay up here.
We've already missed the train.<eos> Let's catch the next one!<eos> - I'm not going anywhere.<eos> - How come?<eos> - That must be the young woman.<eos> - Right!<eos> I have orders from professor Berankova.<eos> Miss, you're coming on a journey.<eos> Why did you want to send those people away?<eos> Firstly, they are not actually people.
Well, now let's have the reading lesson.<eos> José María. What do you have there?<eos> A giant cricket, master.<eos> It's not the time to play with crickets.<eos> Come here with your book.<eos> Page fifteen.<eos> Bees give us honey.<eos> Sheep give us wool.<eos> Cows give us milk.<eos> But they don't give us anything, Teacher, we take it from them by force!
Follow me.<eos> While tending to Martin, I think I could sense something of the Lord's desires.<eos> Help me to implore him to enlighten us.<eos> I believe the Lord has deigned to let me know his will.<eos> As you know, we have now lived in shacks made of reeds and mud there in Assisi and from them we started to travel the world, taking our message of holy poverty and charity.<eos> Although we're done here loggers.<eos> It is possible that the Lord has made use of that road to tell us he wants us to stop our order being pilgrim and gain stability.<eos> We must found monasteries.<eos> Found convents?<eos> That is against our rules, they say we can not own anything.
Come, this side.<eos> Here's your place.<eos> Let's go.<eos> God has taken our vicar when we needed him most.<eos> Father Antonio always said that we must resign to God's will.<eos> Here, everyone is resigned to everything.<eos> God thought that no one else needed him here. And he died.<eos> He died, but no one can change anything.<eos> Father Antonio didn't let us change.<eos> Here we are all resigned to God's will, and to things as they've always been.
Who will come with me?<eos> Well, then, stay but don't complain later.<eos> When I was a child I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child but when I became a man, I put away childish things.<eos> For now we see through a glass, darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known.<eos> And now abideth faith, hope, and charity but the greatest of these is charity.<eos> Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.<eos> And though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains and have not charity, I am nothing.<eos> And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity it profiteth me nothing.<eos> Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up doth not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.<eos> Charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail whether there be tongues, they shall cease whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.
Just practicing to kill.<eos> Enjoy, señor?<eos> Is good.<eos> She is pleased.<eos> She watches.<eos> You do not have to go to Cocatlan, señor, to get to Batopilas.<eos> I know a very good road.<eos> It will save you five, maybe six hours.<eos> Well, I've heard about the women in Cocatlan, and I've been alone for 2 weeks now, and I was looking forward a little bit to see them, you know.<eos> And they look forward to you.
- Sorry.<eos> You mailed that yourself yesterday.<eos> Oh, did I?<eos> Is Haru home?<eos> Your god is here.<eos> This house rests on neglected tombs.<eos> Those souls have no place to go now.<eos> There's something holding them back.<eos> It's no good.<eos> They won't go away.
- Had you promised to marry her?<eos> - I... I didn't think.<eos> Well, I couldn't make any promises because I'm married already.<eos> Have you any letters from her?<eos> I won't do anything to you, don't be afraid.<eos> I've got the letters. Now you will have to leave Moscow by morning.<eos> And one other thing. You'll never breathe a word about what happened.<eos> I know I can't prevent you from doing so, but if there remains in you a scrap of human conscience...<eos> If you must, go to women like my wife for your diversion.<eos> They know what you want, and so there you're within your rights.

An inquiry in the Parliament.<eos> Garin got 20 million pounds from a bank!<eos> The "Arizona" yacht is crossing the Pacific!<eos> Garin has made grandiose purchases at Rolling's expense!<eos> Garin's hyperboloid cuts through any armor and opens the way into the bowels ofthe earth!<eos> It's about you. Do you hear?<eos> Listen' Arthur' or whatever your name is' stop tricking me.<eos> I don't believe Garin.<eos> My formulas and notes are soldered in a tin box and securely hidden.<eos> I'll fly away' but they'll remain here.
Hey, it squirted in my face.<eos> See what happens when you're naughty?<eos> Well, we had breakfast in Cairo, then we flew off to London.<eos> How did you fly, Aunt Clara, prop or jet?<eos> - Proper what?<eos> - Jet.<eos> What airlines did you take from Cairo to London?<eos> Airlines?<eos> Witches don't bother with airlines.<eos> They just take off.
And it goes on.<eos> England supports Chile's independence.<eos> Isabelle the Second of Spain has bombarded the city.<eos> The last stand of a frustrated colonizer.<eos> And then the earth opens, in turn.<eos> Earthquakes, floods, fires cyclones and pillages this was to be the destiny of this peaceful people.<eos> And it's not finished yet.<eos> But what will finish?<eos> The sirens haven't finished singing in the port.<eos> They are there, waiting.

Because.<eos> I want another one, that's why.<eos> I wanted another one.<eos> A bigger one.<eos> You know.<eos> Because it's more comfortable. And it's just in case.<eos> And to me, it is very important that I can always put up my married cousins.<eos> Come on, then.<eos> No one's going to rape you.<eos> No. Girls don't get raped unless they want it.
Mama's little Joyboy Want lobster for Mom<eos> And then the whole dream changes.<eos> I don't know, it...<eos> It becomes like a nightmare.<eos> Because when I put that big darn platter of juicy lobsters down in front of Mom they're still alive, as if I haven't cooked them at all.<eos> Then, suddenly, I'd start to cry because I feel that I've let Mom down again.<eos> "That's all right," she says.<eos> "I'll take them the way they are."<eos> By golly, she tears right into those live lobsters, claws and all.<eos> But they fight back.
And where, may I ask, did they get these... . -Play clothes.<eos> -Is that what they are?<eos> I made them from the drapes that used to hang in my bedroom.<eos> -They have plenty of wear left.<eos> We've been everywhere in them.<eos> Are you telling me that my children have been roaming about Salzburg... ... dressedupin nothing but some old drapes?<eos> And having a marvelous time!<eos> -They have uniforms.<eos> -Forgive me, straitjackets.<eos> They can't be children if they worry about clothes--
That was exactly what I meant<eos> So young!<eos> The real tea plantation is much more gloomy<eos> I wanted it to be gay and passionate... not gloomy<eos> After Miss Ueno... you must have had many affairs<eos> I know<eos> You're right<eos> Nothing as tragic as it was with Otoko<eos> Why don't you write about them?<eos> They don't want me to and I'm too old to let them down
[talking in German]<eos> TEMPTATION<eos> You, who called me wife?<eos> When I look at waves in the sea, at landscapes, at clouds in the sky - I see his stare.<eos> For his happiness I would cut my arm off without regret.<eos> And you are repulsive and dreadful in your wisdom and kindness.<eos> With smile of chastity on your face, searching for truth, with wrinkles on your forehead... Who are you?<eos> You, who called me wife.<eos> The one who was worth these flowers is gone, my brother.<eos> They bloom for her, they praise her. My soul met her.
I'm very suspicious of any filmmaker that pretends to play the important pointing ways, these kind of things.<eos> I'm very suspicious of others and, therefore, even of ourselves.<eos> Of you and I when we claim to be like that.<eos> But, in the end, you're the man who laid the roots.<eos> And the idea of the film was to see if ..<eos> 'You're the man... 'whomadewhat?<eos> The man who laid the roots of the brazilian cinema.<eos> And we decided to see the obvious...<eos> To see the life that lied in these roots<eos> And they are pretty much alive -- the roots of the cinema that you proposed and still propose.
Now, everyone uses the traditional Halloween witch.<eos> Who's to say they really look like that?<eos> Now, my idea is to get away from the old stereotype and use a beautiful well-dressed witch as your trademark.<eos> You are nuts.<eos> Witches got long noses and blacked-out teeth...<eos> Stop.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Look here, fella, I don't like being insulted.<eos> Neither do witches.<eos> They've got feelings too.
I'm not interested in promises.<eos> I'm interested in the real story.<eos> And don't tell me about Panohai.<eos> I looked it up.<eos> Panohai went out of existence thousands of years ago.<eos> Forgive me, but you worry too much.<eos> You worry about how I brought my circus to Abalone without wagons.<eos> You worry about the future of your town or if the sun will rise a year from today.<eos> The answers to such matters remain posed behind a curtain.<eos> Then time says, "" Presto! "" And out they come.
I don't like the idea that every time I take off my hat... some thing up there knows I'm losing my hair.<eos> I want to be sure that thing doesn't get any ideas of its own.<eos> I see what you mean, but that's a chance you take with these systems.<eos> Who says we have to take that chance?<eos> Who voted who the power to do it this particular way?<eos> I'm the only one around here that got elected by anybody.<eos> Nobody gave me that power.<eos> It's in the nature of technology.<eos> Machines are developed to meet situations.<eos> Then they take over, they start creating situations.
- He'll have a cup of coffee with us.<eos> - Fine, wonderful.<eos> Sit down there, Vince, while Laura stirs us up some coffee.<eos> - You won't be long?<eos> - It's almost ready.<eos> - Remember my meeting?<eos> - I don't see how I could forget it.<eos> I've got United Citizens council tonight.<eos> Women don't understand the importance of civic things.<eos> A man attends his civic responsibilities and they feel deserted.
That, too, was murdered.<eos> No-one ever comes here to play.<eos> We spend our time between funerals and burials.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Never saw a town as dead as this one.<eos> You will never see another like it.<eos> - What's wrong with the place?<eos> - We've had too many killings.<eos> You have seen the women?<eos> None of them are women, they're widows.
- Do you think she's attractive?<eos> - Who?<eos> - Beth. - Oh.<eos> She's all right, I suppose.<eos> I need you.<eos> What about those Arab women?<eos> - I can't begin to tell you.<eos> - Did they like you?<eos> Wouldn't leave me alone.<eos> Did they touch you like this?
Where is my child tonight?<eos> Fresh air.<eos> Freedom.<eos> We're tied to them with an umbilical cord!<eos> - It's not easy to cut.<eos> - You're dependent on women.<eos> Good Lord, no!<eos> But they can use the cord to feed our vanity and strangle our independence.<eos> Beware of women, Sam.<eos> They serve one purpose, anyway.
But you're shivering, my sweet!<eos> Such a tiny hand.<eos> Stanny's are so big and coarse. Real navvy's hands.<eos> Now I've hurt you.<eos> I didn't mean to.<eos> I was hurt deeply as child.<eos> That's why you girls mean so much to me.<eos> I was very lonely, a foster child.<eos> And very unhappy.<eos> They must be hereabouts.
- Even prisoners can have fun.<eos> Someone's coming!<eos> Scared?<eos> Well, we've plenty of time.<eos> - How long are you staying?<eos> - Not long.<eos> - My painting stuff is in Stockholm.<eos> - Can't you go and get it?<eos> - If I had the money.<eos> - Loose change for my errand boys. If they're good and do their duty.
There's a difference?<eos> Sure, an immoral guy is a guy who knows he's doing wrong, but he keeps on doing it anyway.<eos> Like me, Paolo, or maybe you might.<eos> An amoral guy doesn't know it's wrong.<eos> Well, so he keeps on doing it too?<eos> Sure.<eos> Whatever this guy is, I don't think a guy should go talking about women the way this guy does.<eos> They're frustrated women, baby, most of them.<eos> He gives them something, like...<eos> Yeah, they give him something, too, maybe, like money.
I mean if I ever went to New York on a visit, would you...?<eos> I mean, would you kind of have a date with me?<eos> I promise.<eos> Cocktails and dinner at a fine restaurant.<eos> A Broadway play.<eos> Dancing.<eos> Whatever you like.<eos> Napoleon Solo with his country bumpkin who smells of soap and has never had anything stronger than apple cider.<eos> What would your sophisticated lady friends think?<eos> Well, I think that they would be very envious of you.
Wise?<eos> No, no, but necessary, assuredly.<eos> Tell me, have you examined your masks?<eos> Ourmasks?<eos> They're-they're, uh, unique, father.<eos> They are very unique.<eos> You know, they are made by an old cajun.<eos> "Made" is inaccurate.<eos> They are created.<eos> I am told that in addition to their artistic value, they have certain, uh... certain properties.
Don't dirty the water, OK?<eos> But look, boys, what nice water is over here!<eos> Hey, can I wash now?<eos> - One moment!<eos> Now you can.<eos> Look, a piece of ice.<eos> - It's the season.<eos> I pity the women.<eos> Really?<eos> They must work too.
"You're a man who likes children<eos> "That's an important sign<eos> "Lucky<eos> "I'm a woman with children<eos> "Small world, isn't it?<eos> "Funny, isn't it?<eos> "Small and funny "And fine"<eos> Sometimes it's a real fine world, Rose like tonight.<eos> But there's tomorrow.<eos> Tomorrow I gotta get those kids on a train and, gee, Herbie, how they hate trains.
Not even if you got down on your knees and begged.<eos> Now look, I still love you, Rose.<eos> But all the vows from here to doomsday couldn't make you a wife.<eos> I want a wife, Rose!<eos> I'm gonna be a man if it kills me.<eos> - So you're killin' me.<eos> - Nobody can kill you.<eos> You think I got a bulletproof vest?<eos> You're jealous, that's what you are.<eos> Of my girls, 'cause they're always first.
Thanks for telling me your great secret.<eos> Yeah. Unnecessary information number one.<eos> I had a serious accident.<eos> Front steps tried to trample on me.<eos> Took advantage of the fog the way...<eos> Ought to be another lighthouse out there.<eos> It's dark in here too.<eos> What the hell is this, the morgue?<eos> "Ford, ford, ford o' Kabul river in the dark!"<eos> "Keep the crossing-stakes beside you, an' they will surely guide you 'Cross the ford o' Kabul river in the dark."
There's this man I met about eight months ago.<eos> Spencer.<eos> He's been very nice to me and...<eos> I don't want to sue anybody for false arrest.<eos> just want to get out of here.<eos> if there's a plane, a train, a bus, or jackass leaving this city, get me on it<eos> - There's a train leaving for Milan in just about an hour.<eos> - Fine. Get me a taxi.<eos> Let me tell you about Italian women.<eos> They're not to be trusted.
Say it and you've got it, but don't get off me now.<eos> Don't beg him.<eos> Go back to the hotel.<eos> Please, Eddie, don't beg him.<eos> Go back to the hotel.<eos> Take a cab, go back!<eos> Doesn't all this come through to you?<eos> Doesn't it mean anything to you?<eos> That man, this place, the people.<eos> They wear masks, and under them they're perverted, twisted, crippled!
He'll meet a maid who will be a mother.<eos> That's common enough in Poland.<eos> You poor, poor lamb.<eos> You'll love a crooked one.<eos> Blessed be the Lord.<eos> For ever and ever.<eos> The holy maids are waiting for you, Father.<eos> And very impatient they are too.<eos> But no one knew I was coming.<eos> They know everything.
Going to Korea?<eos> No, back to Peihutow. Though we're not sure what we'll find there.<eos> Will you take as far as the lake?<eos> How old are you?<eos> Eighteen.<eos> We're fast walkers.<eos> We'll keep up. We did this far.<eos> Had any trouble en-route?<eos> We had geisha girls with us.<eos> They sacrificed themselves.
With the right clothes they'd pass off as kings.<eos> - They would?<eos> - Well, look at Annie.<eos> The count fell for her.<eos> And you and me.<eos> And Carlos thinks the Dude is a young Abe Lincoln.<eos> And the count even swallowed Joy Boy, and I can do better than that in a pet shop.<eos> If you weren't a broad I'd kick you right in the stomach.<eos> And my old chorus girls.<eos> Why, they'd make the most glamorous society queens this town's ever seen!
And we all feel that way.<eos> $10,000.<eos> You know what you ought to do with that money, Lena?<eos> You ought to go off somewhere, like South America or Europe.<eos> Just go on off and have yourself a ball for once in your life.<eos> What would I look like, wandering around Europe by myself?<eos> What?<eos> Those rich white women do it.<eos> I read about it all the time.<eos> Their feet gets itching, and the next thing you know, they're packed and gone, waving at the rest of us from them ocean liners.
Give me three more days.<eos> If you really loved me, you wouldn't behave like this.<eos> You don't know what sacrifice and renunciation means.<eos> But what are your feelings for me?<eos> Love. Affection. Pity or weariness?<eos> What're you saying?<eos> What nonsense?<eos> Don't you see how much I like you?<eos> No.<eos> Well, women think they represent all existence.
I hope this doesn't sound like braggadocio because really, I'm a very modest fairy godfather.<eos> Oh.<eos> But it wasn't a godmother that Cinderella had.<eos> No?<eos> It was me.<eos> It was you.<eos> - It was me.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You see, Fella, the women reporters of that period, they wrote the story.<eos> So naturally, they attributed my magic to a woman.
THE SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS.<eos> I UNDERSTAND THE ARMY'S RESPONSIBLE.<eos> THE BRIGADE OF GUARDS. THERE'S A NIGHTLY WATCH CALLED THE BANK PICKET-- AN OFFICER, A SERGEANT, AND 16 GUARDSMEN.<eos> EHH, TOY SOLDIERS.<eos> THEN THAT'S WHERE WE'LL START<eos> AND SEE IF THEY MELT.<eos> GOOD.<eos> YOU WILL KEEP ME INFORMED, MRS. MULDOON.<eos> IT WON'T BE EASY. THESE WALLS ARE CONSIDERED IMPREGNABLE.<eos> THEY HAVE WITHSTOOD WARS, RIOTS, THE DREAMS OF THIEVES, AND TIME, BUT REMEMBER THIS, MY TALENTED CHILDREN,
They won't speak a word.<eos> Our effort was in vain.<eos> - The troop?<eos> - It's a small and bad one.<eos> People are fed up with it.<eos> - And the woman?<eos> - Well, let's say it this way: She's a slut, that's why she's called "The Cockroache".<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> Cockroaches are not fine with a single male.<eos> They manage to take other cockroaches' males.
Colonel I've been out here so often you'd think I'd taken a lease on this place.<eos> Not a long lease, I hope.<eos> I see what you mean.<eos> But you know, I can't help but feel the answer's out here somewhere.<eos> Is the uh girl safe ?<eos> Mrs. Trent you'd better stay with the car.<eos> -Stay here alone?<eos> Not on your life.<eos> -Modern women...<eos> -Yeah, they been that way all down through the ages.
- Vitamins and minerals.<eos> - Vitamins and minerals.<eos> With an appropriate nutritional balance, you wouldn't have any gray hair.<eos> I like having gray hair, so I can worry without it showing.<eos> - I used to be just like you.<eos> - What, gray hair?<eos> - No.<eos> I was run down and poor appetite.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Then I started taking these pills that I have here... - ...and they really built me up.
He was a sentimental man.<eos> Hurry up, Milly, we'll be late for the movie.<eos> If your husband died, would you marry again?<eos> I don't think I'd wait for that.<eos> I suppose you could marry again, if you call it a marriage.<eos> It's terrible.<eos> I have to marry for keeps.<eos> I'd be much better off as a mistress.<eos> Milly, don't let the nuns make you hard.<eos> They don't talk to me that way, not that way at all.
And what's this supposed to be?<eos> It's a receipt for the. 300 Magnum rifle I mailed to California.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> This is going to do me a lot of good.<eos> So far the lab hasn't even been able to determine what kind of a gun killed Felix and Foley.<eos> All they've been able to come up with is a few scraps of soft lead.<eos> I know, sir.<eos> May I have a drink of water?<eos> Help yourself.<eos> As I told you, Commissioner, I filed down the bullets in such a way that they were bound to disintegrate on impact.
Beat the drums, here comes the night<eos> Running through the darkness, from one to another<eos> Without the slightest sound, creep up and spear them<eos> With lightest of steps, approach and kill them<eos> Let rivers of blood run from them<eos> Bleeding, bleeding<eos> Sell it to the native women<eos> Sell it to the native women<eos> The native women, when they see the blood flow<eos> Oh how happy they will be They leap and dance with joy
Why?<eos> - Just a feeling.<eos> One shouldn't allow feelings to dictate one's actions.<eos> Anything else?<eos> - Yes, the bills.<eos> The household gobbles up the budget.<eos> - Sure, Sr. Superior.<eos> Where else can we economise?<eos> The girls complain of hunger.<eos> Hunger. What do they know of hunger?
Little girls?<eos> - Are they all little girls?<eos> - Yes.<eos> They told me while we were discussing the latest in fashion.<eos> Oh, be careful.<eos> Don't drop him.<eos> Her.<eos> I won't.<eos> See, this is the first thing you learn in Home Economics, Clayton.<eos> After they eat, they've got an awful lot of air bubbles in them.
And we ourselves die there under Goona spears?<eos> That would be easy.<eos> Does anyone disagree?<eos> Oh, King, do we go to Goona?<eos> KING OF WONGO: We do not go.<eos> That will be our answer.<eos> If we do not go, we do not have to send any words at all.<eos> If this man leaves here alive, our foolish women Will never forget him.<eos> That is true.<eos> They're dream.
I left the book in full sight for him.<eos> His name is Greymalkin.<eos> A very fashionable name for English cats in the Middle Ages.<eos> - They were used in witchcraft.<eos> - It was not that cat.<eos> Oh, yes, it was.<eos> You must have awakened him.<eos> You shouldn't have, at the time of the full moon... when cats wander and witches dance.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> They do dance.
This music brings out the Belafonte in me, Miss Marlowe.<eos> No, you're so different tonight.<eos> No, I'm the same Lover Doll I've always been, honest.<eos> Shoulders narrow and not much chin<eos> But ugly duckling the swan grew quick<eos> To beat off the women You carry a stick<eos> Your mouth, it's nice Your eyes are blue<eos> Your nose is finely chiselled too<eos> When you walk down the street It's true<eos> You don't whistle at girls Because they whistle at you
Won't sleep.<eos> He hasn't eaten a thing.<eos> He hasn't touched the orange juice.<eos> A piece of toast. Soup or something.<eos> But he don't wanna touch nothing.<eos> Min?<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - The kids?<eos> - Oh, they're fine.

Them guys may be rough. Here.<eos> Don't ever point a gun at nobody!<eos> What are you worrying about?<eos> I never shot nobody by accident.<eos> Stop fooling around with them instruments!<eos> We'll wait for them Martians to come and let them run the ship.<eos> Hey, talk about fooling' around, they got any dames in this Mars place?<eos> Naturally, they got dames.<eos> I seen pictures from there.<eos> They got big heads, four arms... and wireless aerials growing' outta their ears.
Soil yourself with your bitches, if you must!<eos> Look at them.<eos> Use your eyes.<eos> But keep silent.<eos> It's time for you to return to your home.<eos> As for me, it's getting unbearable.<eos> They are all there, roaming around the house.<eos> - You're throwing me out?<eos> - No, Roger.<eos> But at the moment, they can heal you better than I can.
- How do you know?<eos> - Your honor, I object to cross-Examination... until the witness has completed her statement.<eos> You knew the paper was being sold to Mr. White.<eos> But I did not know it was going to be rubbed out of existence,<eos> Which it will be if this contract is approved.<eos> What happens to this newspaper after it has been sold is of absolutely no concern here.<eos> Is Mr. Crane the lawyer and the judge?<eos> This is a cheap display of sensationalism and conspiracy.<eos> - Would the other heirs care to reconsider? - No, sir.<eos> Would it be all right, Mr. Crane, If they answered for themselves?
I don't want anything more from you!<eos> I'm not staying in this place for a minute longer!<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> You think my wife was waiting on those stairs for a party?<eos> I even lost my ring!<eos> What about me? A month in this place...<eos> How am I to pay for that?<eos> So that's how it is!<eos> Our daughters have to pay.<eos> Yes, they are the guilty ones.
-Well, goodness!<eos> -Don't let her stay here and go to seed. - Go on now.<eos> Don't you take root-- - Please, girls!<eos> We don't want weeds in our bed.<eos> Move along, move along.<eos> All right, if that's the way you feel about it.<eos> If I were my right size, I could pick every one of you if I wanted to.<eos> And I guess that would teach you.<eos> You can learn a lot of things from the flowers. Hm!<eos> Seems to me they could learn a few things about manners.
I've kept my part of the bargain.<eos> Now keep yours.<eos> Release my ship to me.<eos> We intend to honour our agreement, Captain.<eos> Which, as you'll remember is that your crimes against us will be forgiven and your ship released to you once Captain Providence is safely in our hands.<eos> Then and only then will the 'Molly O'Brien' be yours. Goodnight, sir.<eos> Listen.<eos> Do you hear a boat?<eos> Too soon.<eos> The French of Martinique call these Caribbean nights 'Nuits de Folie' because they drive the wenches mad.
What are you saying<eos> A documentary report<eos> We asked for a top<eos> I mean spinning top We killed time with it<eos> My husband is good<eos> Don't excite single girls Silly!<eos> We won't play with tops!<eos> That's too childish!<eos> Single girls don't understand<eos> They're to be pitied
- No. No, I'm afraid not.<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> You could do me one favor.<eos> - Anything.<eos> - Tell me, Captain. What's your secret?<eos> - Secret?<eos> Yeah. Let's face it.<eos> We do resemble each other.<eos> We proved that last night.<eos> But when women look at you, they
You could do me one favor.<eos> - Anything.<eos> - Tell me, Captain. What's your secret?<eos> - Secret?<eos> Yeah. Let's face it.<eos> We do resemble each other.<eos> We proved that last night.<eos> But when women look at you, they<eos> - Well, you know.<eos> And when they look at me, they run for the nearest exit.
Be patient with her<eos> My name's Elisabeth<eos> The girls will tease, but they're nice.<eos> You'll get used to it<eos> Let's see what's under those clothes<eos> I've everything to learn<eos> I'll see she learns fast<eos> The two orphans!<eos> Don't look so grim.<eos> If they make fun of you, make fun of them
But when I came to,<eos> I was standing by the pond, at the foot of the hill.<eos> I threw myself into the pond.<eos> I tried many different things.<eos> But I failed to kill myself.<eos> What should a poor, helpless woman like me do?<eos> I see.<eos> The more I hear, the more confused I get.<eos> But women use their tears to fool everyone.<eos> They even fool themselves.
Emma, you must swear to me... that you'll never befriend a woman you think is less than irreproachable.<eos> I know you wouldn't seek out such friendships, but these women of dubious reputation often seek out the company of respectable women out of a sort of nostalgia for virtue.<eos> What I just said is very profound: It's a nostalgia for virtue.<eos> Their own unworthiness pains them.<eos> - You think so? - I'm absolutely positive.<eos> Think of their dreadful lives: Trickery, lies, and constant danger.<eos> They pay dearly for the tiny bit of happiness... not even happiness...<eos> Pleasure?<eos> How can you call that pleasure?<eos> I'm just guessing. Otherwise they wouldn't...
You can rest in your room.<eos> You don't have to attend tonight.<eos> Are you still at it?<eos> Are you finished?<eos> Let's go.<eos> According to the statistics, almost all of the women who are arrested say they do it to survive.<eos> But, the truth is that most of them are really decadent types who want money to buy what they want.<eos> These women are dragging down Japanese womanhood.<eos> People often make excuses for all this and say that there's nothing wrong with doing what do you want to do.<eos> Or that if they didn't do it, good and proper women would be harassed by men.
One we just wrote yesterday.<eos> Well, not exactly yesterday.<eos> As a matter of fact, it took us about 10 years.<eos> Phil, if you please?<eos> Three little words<eos> Oh, what I'd give for That wonderful phrase<eos> To hear those Three little words<eos> That's all I'd live for The rest of my days<eos> And what I feel in my heart<eos> They tell sincerely
He's one of the guys we're after.<eos> We'll have to check up you, ma'am.<eos> Yes, I quite understand, but I want to get a message through to my commanding officer in London.<eos> Looks to me like what you need right now is a stiff shot of Cognac and a nice juicy steak.<eos> Come along.<eos> I could not eat. I must get a message to London!<eos> OK. But who is your commanding officer?<eos> Major Buckmaster, of the French section of the War Office.<eos> You think my children will know me like this?<eos> Well, I think you'll find they've changed a lot too.
Yeah.<eos> Gee, I'm glad to see you.<eos> - No. Don't.<eos> - What's the matter?<eos> - I ain't good enough for you?<eos> - No, it ain't that.<eos> You know, Francey, I never forgot you.<eos> Go on, you with all your fancy dames.<eos> Where do I come off?<eos> - They don't mean nothing.
Insidious bribery to corrupt, brutal violence to intimidate and cold-blooded murder to silence any who dared protest.<eos> Had all these succeeded as they had so often in the past I wouldn't be here prosecuting Vanning for murder.<eos> And why did he fail?<eos> Was it because our leading citizens had risen in righteous indignation to rid the city of this criminal racketeer?<eos> Ladies and gentlemen these leading citizens, men of reputation, men of standing, men of righteousness who cried to high heavens that the city was overrun with crime and corruption when they were called upon to testify, to do something about it to risk even a little, did they? No.<eos> They were either too busy or too afraid.<eos> Out of all the teeming millions of this great city only five girls had the courage to take their very lives in their hands and accuse Johnny Vanning.<eos> In spite of all threats of reprisals, the horror of which they knew too well they were ready to appear before you to testify.<eos> And let me be the first to admit the truth of the accusations that were brought against these girls in a desperate effort to discredit them.<eos> Frankly, they're...
- Don't you dare go away without me.<eos> Why, I didn't see anything unusual, no.<eos> Well, maybe it was the wind.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> Cosmo?<eos> Come right in here.<eos> For heaven's sake, what are you doing home at this time of day?<eos> - I mean, I thought it would be nice... to feel how it would be to be here during the daytime, you know.<eos> I really can't understand these women.<eos> They...
- Better-tasting.<eos> - We agree on that.<eos> When I say it's harmless, I should explain.<eos> It's said that aperitifs are bad for the Liver.<eos> But aperitifs are made from plants.<eos> Wormwood, gentian... sage, aniseed, orange.<eos> - And alcohol.<eos> - A vine is a plant.<eos> None of these plants have Livers.<eos> - They don't know what a Liver is. - And neither do I -

What--?<eos> Now look here, you sit right up here, and I'll tell you all about it.<eos> Now, I'll be honest with you.<eos> -I'm not really your fellow.<eos> -You mean you don't like me anymore?<eos> I not only like you, I love you.<eos> But you know, I'm the funniest kind of a fellow.<eos> I love all the girls.<eos> How can you do that?<eos> Do they let you?
You've been doing pretty good around here.<eos> All you rathole and dive owners have been cleaning up.<eos> You've been running wild, clipping suckers... and robbing all these hardworking miners of their gold.<eos> I'm gonna put you through the cleaners.<eos> From now on, you'll do your part.<eos> - You and your girls be there Sunday night.<eos> - That's our biggest night.<eos> I know, but from now on, it's gonna be our night.<eos> We'll be expecting you.<eos> Be sure your girls look their best 'cause they're gonna serve the refreshments.
I'll tell him to go away.<eos> Don't get too close to him.<eos> How do you do, lady?<eos> Right smart weather we're having.<eos> You get away from here and leave town as fast as you can.<eos> is that the way to greet an old friend?<eos> An old drinking companion?<eos> You listen to me.<eos> My two aunts and the worst gossip in town are watching us.<eos> As far as they're concerned, I don't know a soul outside of Lynnfield.
On mine alone we could save enough maybe even to go to Europe.<eos> Well, you'll be all tired at night.<eos> You work late.<eos> You got worse hours than I have.<eos> We're not giving marriage a fair break.<eos> We wanna have a home and kids.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Like everybody else.<eos> Whitey, you're not like the rest of the girls in our crowd that got married.<eos> They all had little jobs that weren't interesting, and they didn't mind staying at home.
- And I to you.<eos> - Then...<eos> No, no. That isn't fitting.<eos> Let me love you. Let me live for you.<eos> Don't let me ask any more from heaven than that.<eos> God might get angry.<eos> Oh, why does anybody want to keep bees, anyhow?<eos> They're so fickle.<eos> If they want to fly away, let them.<eos> They'll fly away when they get the swarming fever unless we make so much noise they settle down again.
You ever see cats walk?<eos> Just like that.<eos> A regular dance rhythm.<eos> - So, you came right back here?<eos> - That's just what I did.<eos> I got the whole thing all mapped out.<eos> Seven boys and seven girls, tomcats and pussycats, cast down in one.<eos> Then we go to full stage with an alley drop... with the ash cans and a board fence.<eos> Twelve girls come out in kitten costumes.<eos> They're the children, see?
But maybe that was from the wine they had for dinner?<eos> It confirms that the two women had been enemies for some time.<eos> He said the accused wanted to attack Mrs. Moore on stage.<eos> It's all proof that she is a violent nature.<eos> But Mr. Fane said the opposite!<eos> Unfortunately his testimony has no value.<eos> He seems in love with the accused.<eos> Everything was clear when they found the body,<eos> The fire poker by her side.<eos> And they quarrelled over a man.
Whenever I ask her, she says, "We've got plenty of time."<eos> - That's odd.<eos> Sometimes I wonder if she prefers Panisse.<eos> She couldn't care less about that old man.<eos> - Then why keep putting it off?<eos> - That's your fault.<eos> Yes, it's your fault!<eos> Let me explain.<eos> Women are proud and easily hurt. And it's no use trying to hide things from them.<eos> They've got a sixth sense.
He sure does take care of his meal ticket, doesn't he?<eos> The grace of our Lord be with you all.<eos> Amen.<eos> CROWD: Amen.<eos> Dearly beloved, all you meek of the earth, all you that labour and are heavy-laden,<eos> I come here to lift the heavy loads from your hearts.<eos> All you that thirst and hunger,<eos> I come here to feed your famished souls.<eos> I stand here in a den which is a cage of fear, behind these bars which are the bars of doubt.<eos> I stand here among beasts that tear and destroy, and behold, they cannot hurt me. For I am...
I've got 20 chiselers on my staff, and I have to split my commission with them.<eos> You may think I'm getting too much, but I don't think 20 percent is enough.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> You seem to forget we're collecting that money to build a tabernacle.<eos> I know, I know, that's what I tell them too.<eos> The trouble with you, Welford, is you're too mercenary.<eos> Now, come on over to my joint and meet some carnival cuties.<eos> They'll make you forget all about money.<eos> WELFORD: Oh, is that so?<eos> They'll never make you forget about it.
I wish we had something to eat.<eos> Shh, or she'll come back.<eos> Miss Hart, I must warn you not to be upset by anything the children may tell you.<eos> They've been very sick.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> I had charge of them at the hospital.<eos> Oh. Since they've been home, they've had bad dreams. Nightmares.<eos> Dr. Ranger says that's all part of their illness.<eos> But they're too young to know the difference between dreams and facts.<eos> You must realize that whenever they tell you anything.
Yes, but you don't answer.<eos> I said I hadn't heard anything.<eos> We were very frightened.<eos> My deafness was very strange.<eos> First it was the right ear... and then the left one.<eos> I wanted to see a doctor...<eos> I took foot-baths, I prayed... but it wasn't any use.<eos> Gradually I lost my hearing... up to a rest of 5%.<eos> I fled to religion.<eos> It gave me strength... but this terrible loneliness stayed on.
Where is the bar?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. I have to use the oven for storage 'cause it's such a small apartment.<eos> Very sensible.<eos> Uh, we're just going to have a simple supper.<eos> Plain home cooking. - Yes, I see.<eos> - That's right. Go ahead and make fun of it.<eos> That insecurity of yours.<eos> I like your house.<eos> It's nice.<eos> It's just like you. You know, somehow that just misses being flattery.
It's two in the morning!<eos> What the hell were you doing?<eos> In the West, the massacre of the red earth, forgotten under the tons of steel and iron, under the appearance of possession, ancient and crisped, with a shown sex and without a sex.<eos> In the East, the accumulation of history and the black earth, violence that springs when wanted, which surges from the marsh of time, and little by little, covers the adversary from whom hope has been taken. In the West, the masses.<eos> In the East, the people.<eos> In the West, the images. In the East, the scene.<eos> In the West, signs without roots, accumulating, signs without any hold on the deep axe of the exterior.<eos> Signs that reflect to the tiny interior of skulls, at the nervous torsion, deeply divided by common ownership, at the knocked out hallucination, only to trace.<eos> In the East, the invisible force of the complete mutation of the square writing that takes to the surest ground, the communal inscription made of skin and blood, the marred thought that knew how to think, each of the appearances that we can see realized,<eos> is the product of the appearance that it needs to produce itself.
That's our timetable.<eos> A Schedule of death no one can avoid... unless he's buried in the ground.<eos> Come, Mr. Dvorak.<eos> We have two gas furnaces which can transform the deceased into dust in an hour and 15 minutes.<eos> We take a break in the afternoon, and you can breathe fresh air in the cemetery.<eos> These little windows allow us to see inside.<eos> You must wait... for a nice cremation.<eos> The ashes are packed into these canisters.<eos> But the soul is not.<eos> It's floating in the ether, free of the bonds of suffering.
I am asking you, Mister.<eos> Take my message to him.<eos> Do you want a good deal?<eos> You find a way of killing the Colonel... and I'll do as you request.<eos> And more, I'll get you a small farm so you can die in peace.<eos> You are an educated man... but my ignorance has a limit.<eos> I'll only kill the Colonel... if he refuses to attend my request.<eos> So why don't you go ahead and speak to him?<eos> Your hand, Mister... it was your hand that crossed my destiny.<eos> Now it shall stay until... the end of it.
My friend...<eos> Michael!<eos> No, don't...<eos> They told me to pretend I was dead, but seeing you, I couldn't.<eos> Forgive us.<eos> We tricked you out of love.<eos> You traitors!<eos> The Grand Hetman!<eos> Well, old soldier.<eos> The hand of God has bowed you to the earth, but it will raise you and give you comfort.
It's already difficult enough for us!<eos> Sorry!<eos> Cesira!<eos> Cesira!<eos> Has the milk arrived?<eos> - Yes, ma'am, I'll bring it up.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll leave the door ajar!<eos> Put the bottle on the table, please, and watch the door because the handle is broken.<eos> It came off in my hand.
-lt is unfitting.<eos> -"Black bottle."<eos> -What?<eos> -What is shouted at him when he goes out?<eos> It do bring the army up for snooks, you know.<eos> Vulgar things.<eos> Shouldn't say these vulgar things at him, Airey.<eos> But what can we do?<eos> Where are they going to put that statue, Airey?<eos> It can't stay there, to be enjoyed by me alone.
That's our special protective device.<eos> As long as that blue light is on, the computer is safe.<eos> Against what?<eos> - Embezzlers.<eos> Oh, now, sir, you're joking, aren't you, sir? - No, no. no, no.<eos> Really?<eos> Embezzlers?<eos> You mean to say that of all this, there is no mechanical way to bypass that blue light?<eos> Mr. Klemper, for the sake of argument, if... not me, someone else, wished to switch it off?<eos> It knows how to protect itself.
One piece of advice:<eos> don't speak about this sailors disease.<eos> They worry, and their histrionics drive me crazy.<eos> I just want that our last evening here be enjoyable.<eos> Bring all of that.<eos> You'll serve refreshments later, when I tell you.<eos> That's proof of their bad intentions.<eos> It's an European issue.<eos> Take a seat. Please.<eos> We only keep the head. It controls the machine.
One for me... one for you.<eos> I'll set the board.<eos> Black and white to opening positions.<eos> The age of computers, Drummond.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Courtesy of a shipping company that failed when its chairman died.<eos> Lost at sea, no doubt.<eos> Precisely.<eos> Now, if you'd like to take white and open the game?<eos> Just tell the computer the move you want to make and it will do the rest.
Will you stop your daydreaming, Tommy Stubbins?<eos> - Hello, Matt. - Come and help me select a suitable dinner...<eos> - for me clients here. - Can I push the barrow?<eos> Well, it's not gonna push itself now, is it?
I'm the messenger, I bring the news.<eos> I have to know.<eos> And?<eos> Come with me.<eos> That's Tiresias, the prophet.<eos> Your brothers and fellows suffer, weep, searching for salvation... And you're here alone, blind and singing...<eos> I wish I were you!<eos> You sing what's beyond destiny.<eos> Our city's misfortune is up there.<eos> It came up from a deep abyss to frighten us.
Sir.<eos> But look, sir, why do you care who killed that bitch?<eos> She's better off dead anyway.<eos> Have you ever heard of the Eumenides?<eos> The what?<eos> Greek mythology.<eos> A number of disagreeable ladies, sometimes known as the Furies.<eos> They believe that spilled blood calls out for vengeance.<eos> That's how justice began.<eos> Well, we don't want it to end, do we, just because there's a war on?
With a Whately living in that house, no one will be safe on this island.<eos> You'll start it up again for sure.<eos> Evil.<eos> You'll excuse me if I find that a little difficult to understand.<eos> There's a lot of things city folks don't understand, Mr. Kelton even with their scientific know-how.<eos> There's a lot of things they've no way of knowing, no way of figuring out.<eos> Like the Whately curse?<eos> Yes, Mr. Kelton.<eos> The Whately curse.<eos> You don't know where it come from, but it's there.
"God gave it to me, woe to whomever touches it!"<eos> It's no longer our frontiers which must be defended, but the enemy states which must be invaded.<eos> Soldiers, by promising peace to the French people,<eos> I was your voice.<eos> You conquered the Rhine, Holland and Italy and dictated peace beneath the walls of an astonished Vienna.<eos> Soldiers, you wish to return to France only by the path of honor.<eos> And we will return to our fatherland through arches of triumph!<eos> Soldiers, here is the battle for which you've yearned.<eos> Henceforth victory depends on you.<eos> It will give you abundance and a prompt return to your fatherland.
How your bitch has grown;<eos> doesn't remember me, eh?<eos> Vaska, take the dog.<eos> Oh please, let me go!<eos> Don't be afraid, beautiful.<eos> I'll show you how Tatars can love.<eos> Well, Prince?<eos> Aren't you sorry about the cathedral?<eos> Tell me, Prince, who is that woman?<eos> It's no woman, it's the Virgin Mary: the Nativity.
Even the tamed wolf returns to the woods when his kind calls him.<eos> Was my call strong enough?<eos> Now you're as lonely as I am, in the belly of the earth, waiting for Zalmoxis' signs.<eos> Will you be able to defeat them?<eos> They lost battles, but they were never defeated.<eos> They're stubborn, strong, numerous and greedy.<eos> Then, let's give them the gold they are asking for.<eos> Never!<eos> I kept my soul in darkness and solitude.<eos> It judges the world by other measures than those of ordinary people.
Everything?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> My wealth, my fortune.<eos> Yes, Sire. I have decided.<eos> I'm perhaps the richest man in Europe, but I've decided to die as if I had nothing.<eos> I've had such pleasure contemplating this thought.<eos> Only, I beg Your Majesty to show benevolence towards my unfortunate family.<eos> I refuse.<eos> I refuse, Cardinal.<eos> The offer is touching as a sign of your attachment to my person and to what it represents.

O, my son!<eos> God put it in thy mind to take it hence, that thou mightst win the more thy father's love, pleading so wisely in excuse for it.<eos> Hear, I think, the very latest counsel that ever I shall breathe.<eos> God knows, by what by-paths and crook'd ways I met this crown, for all my reign hath been but a scene, acting that argument, and now my death changes the mode.<eos> For what in me was purchas'd, falls upon thee in a more fairer sort, yet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do, thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green.<eos> And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends, have their stings and teeth newly out.<eos> And by whose power I well might lodge a fear, to be again displac'd.<eos> Harry, be it thy course to busy giddy minds with foreign quarrels, that action, hence borne out may waste the memory of the former days.<eos> I am weak, and my lungs are wasted so, that strength of speech is utterly denied me.<eos> O, God forgive me how I came to the crown, and grant it may with thee in true peace...
I'll see if I can't find out from the producer.<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Swan. Can you tell me...?<eos> Oh, he walked straight on in.<eos> I guess he couldn't hear me.<eos> And I don't blame him.<eos> There's a tremendous amount of noise going on here as our radio audience can certainly hear.<eos> And I suppose he just didn't hear me.<eos> I think this may be Daisy now.<eos> The crowd is really beginning to roar.<eos> No, it isn't.
Why are you keeping it?<eos> Do you need money?<eos> You are really very kind.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> My train is leaving in ten minutes.<eos> Now, there comes the television<eos> Due to this remarkable technological advance we are every day and every hour the astonished witnesses of a miracle<eos> Television can refine into perfection and virtually replace ... all the traditional forms of spectacle.<eos> Within a few years it has been installed in every living room And now it has become part of our daily life<eos> It is in tune with the rhythm of our lives
I expect some presents too.<eos> Look at this glutton.<eos> Let's see who's faster!<eos> You fool!<eos> Damn you.<eos> Have a good trip.<eos> Olbromski?<eos> Come here, please.<eos> How did you get this streak, sir?<eos> When we were passing a tree, princess... bent a little branch of a birch and... gracefully let it go at me.
It is a happy surprise to see that chaos is not the rule.<eos> Here, the hand of man, together with chance, makes for a rigid layout.<eos> The lines assert themselves - vertical, horizontal, curved or oblique - create contrasts, relations, rhythms, rhymes and parallelism.<eos> We're now in the coal field of the Pas-de-Calais, near Béthune.<eos> An ancient habit has sealed the reconciliation of nature and human activity.<eos> An osmosis has taken place, each one borrowing characteristics of the other.<eos> The factories, aged by the years and by fog and coal dust are part of the landscape.<eos> While this one - having lost its usual serenity - seems to aid the intense labour of man.<eos> As in volcanic areas, the earth works.<eos> It turns its own hand to great work.

And you, alex, which are the main influences that you'd stress?<eos> well, I don't know, I think the film is...<eos> When Humberto went Rio to see the first rushes...<eos> When he saw the rushes with more than 3 hours in the MovioIa<eos> Then I wrote a letter, you gave me your first opinions about the film and suggested some cuts.<eos> I wrote you a letter saying that the film was really weird because, at the same time that it was a homage to you -- and, therefore, a very 'Mauroan' like film - it was a film that had resulted in a very personal work from me.<eos> I am entirely in the film, don't you think?<eos> And with all my defects and some possible qualities.<eos> But, at the same time, the film took an identity of its own.<eos> It exists by itself.

The empire is yours, Livius.<eos> You would not find me suitable.<eos> Because my first official act would be to have you all crucified.<eos> Two million dinars for the throne of Rome.<eos> Two million dinars for the throne.<eos> Two million five hundred thousand dinars.<eos> Two million and seven hundred fifty thousand dinars.<eos> Two million...<eos> This was the beginning of the fall of the Roman empire.<eos> A great civilization is not conquered from without, until it has destroyed itself from within.
If we sin, do we go to Purgatory?<eos> Sin?<eos> People been doing this thousands of years.<eos> I'd go to Purgatory with you!<eos> A vast field of grass.<eos> Can't tell what lives here-demons or snakes.<eos> And monsters like you stray in.<eos> I'm a demon.<eos> Why do you wear a mask?<eos> I look stronger with it on, don't I?
Veer right!<eos> Mona the monkey spends most ofher days off somewhere.<eos> Where she goes I have no idea.<eos> Thank God she doesn't seem to need or want water.<eos> I've offered it to her every day.<eos> I'm on strict rationing myself, and even then I'll be out of water in a few days.<eos> Well, I've now been on Mars for two weeks.<eos> I've tried on several occasions to talk down the wreck of our space vehicle, the Elinor M.<eos> I can't break it out of Mars's gravity grip.<eos> It answers electronically, but the jets don't fire.
- What's up, George?<eos> - You'll find out.<eos> Where is he?<eos> The chief is the most punctual man on earth.<eos> In exactly one and four-fifths seconds that door will open and...<eos> We're ready, sir.<eos> This magazine Stop was started not by my father not by my grandfather but by my great grandmother.<eos> It has been in my family now for four generations.
Please, sir.<eos> Bring him back to me the way he was. My Gwyllm.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> The whole town must be utterly destroyed. An example must be made.<eos> You're wrong!<eos> The human race has a gift, Professor, a gift that sets it above all the other creatures that abound upon this planet.<eos> The gift of thought, of reasoning, of understanding.<eos> The highly developed brain .<eos> But the human race has ceased to develop.<eos> It struggles for petty comfort and false security.
I'm not a mean man.<eos> But the television industry is looking for talent, for quality.<eos> They're preoccupied with talent and quality.<eos> And the writer is a major commodity.<eos> Let me give it a try.<eos> Let me give it a whirl.<eos> I mean, let me walk it around the block a couple of times.<eos> What about this series?<eos> Maybe it's right up my alley.<eos> Maybe it and me can go together. Well, that's the point.
A clever man may err, a fool will never do, and that's amazing!<eos> No social formation, even the most perfect one, can guarantee itself against fools.<eos> They're indestructible.<eos> You're... pure gold, Ilya.<eos> Anyway, let's drop by the new installation.<eos> What for?<eos> Just to take a look.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, all my hopes are put in it now.<eos> Are you sure that it's principally different from the old one?
More than ever before.<eos> Tell her, Guy.<eos> Tell her.<eos> Kate... you've been most considerate... and you've always thought of my welfare.<eos> That is true.<eos> But in some things, I must make my own decisions.<eos> Of course.<eos> Then I take it you have made your decision?<eos> I have.<eos> Then let it be on your own head.
No, it is not.<eos> How can you testify about events in the administration if you were not there?<eos> I had many friends in the legal administration.<eos> There were journals and books.<eos> From journals and books?<eos> I see.<eos> Dr Wieck, you referred to "novel National Socialist measures introduced, among them sexual sterilisation."<eos> Are you aware that sexual sterilisation was not invented by National Socialism, but had been advanced for years before as a weapon in dealing with the mentally incompetent and the criminal?<eos> Yes, I am aware of that.<eos> Are you aware it has advocates among leading citizens in many countries?
I'm sorry.<eos> What a shame the people have let it fall into such a state.<eos> Strangers rarely come to Whitewood.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm Nan Barlow, I'm staying at the Raven's Inn.<eos> Why have you come to Whitewood?<eos> Well... because I'm interested in witchcraft.<eos> Young woman, leave Whitewood.<eos> Leave Whitewood tonight.<eos> For 300 years, the devil has hovered over this city, made it his own.
It was a trompe-l'oeil reality... through which we had to discover... the potential richness of what was really there.<eos> On the bank of the river... evening began again; and the caresses; and the importance of a world without importance.<eos> Just as the eyes have a blurred vision of many things... and can clearly see only one, so the will can strive... only imperfectly toward diverse objects ... and can completely love only one at a time.<eos> No one counted on the future.<eos> It'd never be possible to be together later, or anywhere else.<eos> There would never be a greater freedom.<eos> The refusal of time and of growing old... automatically limited encounters in this narrow... and contingent zone, where what was lacking was felt as irreparable.<eos> The extreme precariousness of their methods for getting by... without working was at the root of this impatience... which made excesses necessary and breaks irrevocable.<eos> We can never really challenge any form... of social organization... without challenging all of that organization's... forms of language.<eos> When freedom is practiced in a closed circle, it fades into a dream, becomes a mere image of itself.
It's a horse.<eos> I'm not that drunk and I'll drive.<eos> All right, you drive.<eos> You think we'd better tie that down?<eos> - What for?<eos> - The road's bumpy.<eos> Just past the nursing home, he said.<eos> Only half a mile.<eos> The mummy.<eos> It's waiting.
The style of this film is not that of a thriller.<eos> Using image and sound, the filmmaker strives to express the nightmare of a young man whose weaknesses lead him to commit acts of theft for which nothing destined him.<eos> However, this adventure, and the strange paths it takes, brings together two souls that may otherwise never have met.
The White Serpent.<eos> Bought a serpent at the market.<eos> It must have been hard on you to be exhibited as an object.<eos> Just a little.<eos> I became good friend with the serpent.<eos> This is an old story.<eos> The adults did not like my serpent.<eos> Throw that away!<eos> But it is so pretty!
You are saying something foolish!<eos> Spirits like you are immortal!<eos> In that case, I don't want to be a spirit anymore.<eos> Are you relinquishing your magic powers?<eos> For the one I love, yes.<eos> Love, you say?<eos> Humans have something we don't have.<eos> They have love!<eos> Since you're so persistent, I won't hold you back.<eos> Take this flower. It will save Hsu Hsien.
There were two people in the room together<eos> So I had a notion of what was like between Daddy and Henrietta I loved them both--- there is nothing I would have done for one of them ln a few days Henrietta came up to live in the big house<eos> There was my Mom who was so violent<eos> 0ne day when Daddy was away,<eos> Mom came down to find me in Henrietta's room There was a terrible thing<eos> She said awful things to me and--- all the time Henrietta just stood there<eos> with her arms around me<eos> So, that's why I hated Mama I wanted to hurt her I've been reading a story about a person who wanted to hurt another person<eos> He wrote him a letter--- but didn't sign it So I wrote a letter and left it in Mama's picture album which she was always looking through<eos> It was---it was just a little note lt said 'Daddy loves Henrietta..-
The best swordsman in France against a callow boy?<eos> A blow was struck.<eos> The blow was provoked, you know it, provoked in cold blood.<eos> It won't be long now.<eos> De Maynes is the ultimate swordsman.<eos> No rival, no peer.<eos> He practices daily with his private instructor, the great Doutreval of Dijon.<eos> You should've learned to use a sword before you turned traitor.<eos> Pick it up.<eos> You shall die with it in your hand.
-A precaution.<eos> If you say you're going for good, Evelyn can get legal action.<eos> And then she won't have to wait for another seven years.<eos> -You've certainly been busy, haven't you?<eos> -Yes, I have.<eos> I guess that's all there is to talk about.<eos> -What about Calder?<eos> -That's up to Malcolm.<eos> -But he is your own brother.<eos> -Since the estate will go to you what you do with it will be your affair.
Men live and die for an idea<eos> But the idea is immortal<eos> One can pursue it, One can judge it,<eos> One can forbid it, One can condemn it to death<eos> But the idea continues to live in the spirit of men<eos> It is everywhere that misery and struggle exist side by side<eos> It rises up now here, now there, it pursues its path through the ages
Come on, Count. Now, you show them.<eos> - What do you suggest?<eos> - Oh, just a good tune.<eos> But not highbrow, like last night.<eos> - Just a good tune, see?<eos> - I see.<eos> Oh, his hunting dogs.<eos> Keep your voice low and listen.<eos> It isn't true about the launch needing repairs.<eos> I heard it leave the boathouse last night.
This is a surprise.<eos> Wolfgang.<eos> Long time no see.<eos> Look, I bought tiles!<eos> Me too!<eos> In small rooms light colours are always better.<eos> And these?<eos> Darker.<eos> And apart from that, the same as the old ones.<eos> Five years ago they were nice.
It doesn't make sense<eos> What about drugs?<eos> Why do people... do drugs?<eos> I don't know and I don't want to know<eos> We're just businessmen!<eos> It's simply market supply and demand<eos> Smoking causes cancer but there will always be smokers<eos> At least I don't advertise<eos> It's not me who got them started!<eos> They bring it on themselves
Ifwe could only be married tomorrow, I would be happy to live on £50 a year.<eos> But that's the sting. That's why you find me so cast down.<eos> The two years we must wait before dear Morland can have the living!<eos> Catherine... How will I endure it?<eos> I can well understand how she feels. Two years is a long time.<eos> But at least she can marry the man she loves.<eos> Not everyone is so fortunate. No, I suppose not.<eos> How sad that is.<eos> Yes, it is. But how many couples marry for love?<eos> I believe my mother and father love each other even more than they love us, and they love us very much.
And raised you as best I could as a normal human being.<eos> You were all that mattered to me, Miranda.<eos> You're lying.<eos> Not this time, Miranda.<eos> What about your parents?<eos> Do you really remember them?<eos> My mother was your sister.<eos> No.<eos> I'm an only child.<eos> They never existed.
I sometimes think it won't matter who wins.<eos> Either way we'll have a whole generation who won't know a thing.<eos> You WERE at the game.<eos> I remember you now.<eos> Have you come to arrest me for taking part?<eos> No, that's not why I'm here.<eos> Then how can I help you?<eos> I'm looking for two lads that were at the game.<eos> You might have noticed them.<eos> They were about 18.
I'm primarily here to find out about the De Perez situation.<eos> I'm afraid I can't help you.<eos> He is attached to the embassy, as he told you, and, as such, he's beyond our reach.<eos> Spain declared their neutrality back in September '39.<eos> However, many of their diplomats, the consular service, the police and the coast guard work for the Germans.<eos> I got this from a friend in Whitehall.<eos> He suggested we pass on what we know about De Perez to the security services.<eos> And what will they do?<eos> I doubt they'll do anything.<eos> They know who he is and what he is.

Doesn't he look like me?<eos> We broke up a few months ago and then got back together again.<eos> I'd like to tell him to stay away, but I can't.<eos> I see him and it starts over.<eos> What's Manrico doing now?<eos> Is he in some radical political group?<eos> I don't know...<eos> -He was reported for robbery.<eos> -Making a career!<eos> I'm cut off from my parents, they hate me, they hate Amedeo, can't stand the idea he's the son of a worker.
The US position has slightly evolved since the arrival of Condoleezza Rice.<eos> There's talk of a ceasefire in Lebanon, with conditions.<eos> However, the Israeli position has not changed.<eos> Ehud Olmert says Israel has the means to wage a long war on Hezbollah.<eos> Beirut's southern suburbs rema in a Hezbollah stronghold.<eos> Young lookout guys on scooters oversee everything. Locals who have not recovered their belongings are directed to shelters.<eos> The location of Hezbollah's main shelter is a secret.<eos> This underground hiding place harbors 1,000 people every night.<eos> "Look, these children don't belong in this shelter!<eos> "They should be playing outside! "
He was in such pain, sir.<eos> What did you do?<eos> You didn't help him?<eos> No, sir.<eos> By all accounts he was very brave.<eos> So few of us have the opportunity to play our part properly.<eos> But he did.<eos> He achieved what he set out to achieve.<eos> He must have been in such awful pain.<eos> If you talk to wounded soldiers, they'll tell you the pain only sets in later.
I cursed my own children, Pullo.<eos> It wasn't their fault.<eos> Don't worry, they'll be back.<eos> You can lift the curse then, no trouble.<eos> You didn't kill an animal on it, did you? - No.<eos> - There you go, then.<eos> The curse isn't sealed.<eos> And when they come back, you can lift it.<eos> No harm done.<eos> What if they don't come back?
George Washington was a cannibal, Michael.<eos> He was a fiend. A murderer, a child-eater.<eos> He was also chosen to be father of our country, and that image was more important than the actuality.<eos> History, Michael, is myth.<eos> It's far more than a collection of names, dates, and places.<eos> It's a system of beliefs, and ultimately it says more about the people who bought into those beliefs than the actual historical participants themselves.<eos> We're taught in school George Washington: Father of our country.<eos> L.C Freed the slaves.<eos> That's our lasting impression of them.<eos> In fact, we are who we are as a nation because of what we believe they were.
It's good to be with you.<eos> It's good to be here in Bagram.<eos> I'm sure any high-ranking officer who toured would see the shackles, because they are going to tour to look.<eos> You know, they are curious just like everybody else is.<eos> There are always officers coming and going through the facility.<eos> We kind of joked about it as being The Greatest Show on Earth.<eos> Everyone wanted to come and look at the terrorists.<eos> Mr. Rumsfeld's office called our office frequently.<eos> Very high commanders would want to be kept up-to-date on a daily basis on certain prisoners there.<eos> They saw them shackled. They saw them hooded. And they said, "Right on!
The Supreme Court rejected the Bush Administration's claims that it could hold detainees indefinitely without allowing them to challenge their detention in the courts.<eos> After the decision, the Military installed special new tribunals to judge whether detainees should remain in Guantanamo.<eos> The Combatant Status Review Tribunals, which the Government hurriedly put in place nine days after we won before the Supreme Court, are a joke! You have no rights!<eos> You have no right to a lawyer. You have no meaningful right to witnesses. You don't really know what the charges are and you certainly don't know what the secret evidence is against you.<eos> They may not ever know!<eos> But that doesn't eliminate the opportunity they have to make a case for why, if they were returned in the future, why they would not continue to pose a threat.<eos> Many of my clients are found not guilty at the CSRT Tribunals. And then the Military thinks that doesn't sound so good. They were being called "Not Enemy Combatants, NEC,<eos> These men aren't necessarily innocent men. That's not an accurate characterization.<eos> You're more accurate in their long title: "No longer identified as an enemy combatant."<eos> They are being held separate from the remainder of the detainees until the United States Government can find a country they can be returned to.
Oh, thanks, sweetie. Now, drag her outside and Joker-gas her or something.<eos> You, ordering me around?<eos> Don't go too far. I've indulged you only because it amused me.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You little imp. I can never stay mad at you.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Very funny.<eos> You bats won't pull the plug on my special.<eos> What have you done?<eos> They sent me down in flames. So I'm returning the favor.
FBI!<eos> Everyone down!<eos> Clear!<eos> It's empty.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Car's clear.<eos> Hasn't been driven for hours!<eos> They're running up their lead.<eos> Tell New York that our suspects' descriptions have changed.<eos> So you think they'll really buy it?
You can keep it!<eos> Okay, I'll give you a ride.<eos> But on one condition.<eos> You lend me your house in the hills.<eos> What house?<eos> Where you held your little romps.<eos> Stuff off!<eos> Shit!<eos> Holy Mary, mother of God...<eos> I want to ask you to help my granddaughter Sarah pass her exams, so she can get away from her parents at last because they don't deserve her.
With some massaging.<eos> You have a Korean problem.<eos> Conservative, less sympathetic to our populist Latino platform.<eos> But any election can be won by cracking, stacking and packing.<eos> Talking about redistricting?<eos> Crack the Korean constituency stack it over three or four other districts, nullify their influence. Pack the new boundary with Latinos.<eos> Then focus on getting out the core vote.<eos> But I would also annex these folks here.<eos> Our message doesn't fly with black folks either.<eos> No matter. They don't vote.
What are you doing?<eos> Right now we are two guys on a joyride.<eos> - Let's keep it that way.<eos> - They're here.<eos> Let's go, Jay!<eos> Agent Randall's handing out the updated case file.<eos> Burchell is our planner.<eos> He's the son of a soldier, and he had 2 years of r.o.t.c. in college, so we should assume he knows how to handle a firearm.<eos> Tyler Fog is the money behind the act he's traveled extensively in the middle east, and Fog audited chemical engineering classes at Yale.<eos> It would be easy to underestimate these guys but the fact is, they had reasons to target President Shears' collection.
This place is supposed to be off the grid.<eos> We have secure phone lines...<eos> Either way, I think we should do this now.<eos> All right.<eos> What's Fallbrook Dunn?<eos> You guys rember the vice president's ties to the california energy crisis?<eos> Right.<eos> Nobody does.<eos> That's 'cause Fallbrook Dunn swept it under the carpet.<eos> They're the cleanup hitters for heads of state, and they've rescued the careers of a lot of congressmen, and I hired 'em to save your asses.
We can't think of this as a failure.<eos> We have had a very successful marriage.<eos> We've had a long marriage, by any standard.<eos> We've got three wonderful kids.<eos> They're grown, they're working, they're...<eos> Just open the car door, Daniel, I need a tissue.<eos> The kids, that's... That's all you.<eos> You made all the sacrifices with that.<eos> I know. But there's a logic to us quitting while we're ahead.<eos> And I think that they'll be able to see that.
Okay.<eos> I'd like to get my equipment in the boat as soon as possible.<eos> You don't want to check into your hotel, or anything, first?<eos> No. Business before pleasure.<eos> Right.<eos> Hey, just so you know - It wasn't all that easy getting you aboard a boat.<eos> Why not?<eos> Aren't I paying enough?<eos> No, it's just that we've had researchers here before.<eos> They say they're here to help, and then they hand in their reports and the fisheries shut down.
Cold?<eos> I'm not cold, I'm friendly!<eos> I'm a very friendly guy.<eos> I'm like the friendliest guy...<eos> Okay - is that one of those guys that wants to talk to me?<eos> (Indian Language)<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm going to talk to those guys.<eos> No, Dan - don't.<eos> Don't do that. They've had a hard time.
It sits down, please.<eos> What is that?<eos> This can seem a stranger, but there was a girl who worked here formerly called Chen Lu?<eos> I do not remember, we had much girls to work for us.<eos> - It went to 40 or 50 years behind. - Were her bones left behind?<eos> What?<eos> The Uncle Raymond, the Foundation of Benevolence, they were sending the bones of turn for the Chinese, were any bones left behind?<eos> The Foundation of Chinese Benevolence it stopped the sending of bones to several years.<eos> The communists took it power and they closed the frontiers, even for the died ones.<eos> - Many bones were left behind. - What they happened?
Well, if it's surprises you're looking for, you have come to the right place.<eos> L... Before you go any further, I have to ask, are you religious yourself?<eos> Yeah, sometimes I think I'm pretty religious.<eos> Then I realize I haven't been to church in ages and I feel guilty, so then I go but then, am I going because I'm faithful or because I'm guilty?<eos> Ah.<eos> So you're just like the rest of us, then.<eos> Good.<eos> Go on.<eos> Well, it started with this smell in Brown Sector which isn't surprising because there's always a smell in Brown Sector but this one wouldn't go away.<eos> And the repair crews, they kept hearing voices in the hallways even when we could determine for sure on the monitors that there was nobody there.
Maggy?<eos> Stop eating!<eos> Give me that basket!<eos> Calm down Monica!<eos> Give it a rest.<eos> Relax, here, eat an apple.<eos> Go on, take it.<eos> Know what? Leave it to me 'cause that's my thing.<eos> If things go on this way, when the boys arrive, there won't even be a grape left for them!<eos> It's not my fault that they're taking so long, wasting their time.
Hey, Maggy!<eos> With a time machine... we can make a birthday party last forever!<eos> Or even Christmas dinner, wouldn't it be great?<eos> - Brunch and Lunch too?<eos> - Oh! Maggy!<eos> Give me a break!<eos> Food! Is that all you can think about?<eos> So?<eos> Now where are those nitwit boys?<eos> They're late for their own picnic.
You recite your poetry while I pump bullets into you.<eos> Didn't I tell you to stay away from me?<eos> What should I do?<eos> It's you who is after me. If I get after you, you Will be in trouble.<eos> When the joke is over, tell Me. I will laugh over it.<eos> While I am still here I will not give you a chance to laugh.<eos> Later on you will not be in the condition to laugh.<eos> I still remember you were a good cook.<eos> Especially cooking up dreams.<eos> Now they..
No, Kevin, I'm done.<eos> You sure it's locked?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Now we sit, we relax, we have a drink, and we wait.<eos> What? Nothin'.<eos> What, are you scared?<eos> No.<eos> Don't worry about these guys, though, Seanie.<eos> I put myself in a position where they need me.
Now we sit, we relax, we have a drink, and we wait.<eos> What? Nothin'.<eos> What, are you scared?<eos> No.<eos> Don't worry about these guys, though, Seanie.<eos> I put myself in a position where they need me.<eos> Why do you think Nicky called?<eos> You don't think he heard about what I've been doin'?<eos> Not just the bookmaking, everything.<eos> They want a piece of this neighborhood, they know they gotta come to me.
But the idiot never went out for track.<eos> Where the hell have you been?<eos> Hey, Tommy.<eos> Thanks for comin'.<eos> No problem. How you doin'?<eos> Good.<eos> Want some wine?<eos> What's on your mind?<eos> You and I both know that your brothers killed Louie Downtown.<eos> They stole his business, which is my business.
Stop doing that, it's gonna choke, I tell you.<eos> - Hey, we should already be shooting, now!<eos> And your bullshit!<eos> Fuck, we're done now!<eos> We lose Madone, it's direct layoff... But you don't give a fuck anyway, you'll always find a job.<eos> At least move your ass for the others!<eos> I'm not even talking about me.<eos> Anyway, I know you despise me, you don't like me.<eos> I'm just a little shitty salesman, is that it?<eos> Think about low wages, the small posts, they will pay the price.
Couple of years ago, a local consortium sold it to German casino operators.<eos> Pissed a lot of people off.<eos> Locals used to go hunting and fishing here.<eos> Now there's a big fence.<eos> Around 90 square miles of the most beautiful country in the state.<eos> - They only got 150 million for this?<eos> - Plus a share of the revenues.<eos> So Dwight and his buddies came hunting up here.<eos> Okay, the ducks are what?<eos> They, they summer here?
Who's withholding the 6?<eos> The Evil Stone is missing?<eos> The Tengu Police have all their available men looking for it.<eos> Sealed in the Stone are 1000 years worth of monsters' grudges.<eos> If it is misused it can be dangerous.<eos> Judge Grand Tengu ordered the Heavenly Fox to disempower the stone.<eos> Tenko the Heavenly Fox?<eos> She's the queen of the fox spirits.<eos> To make matters worse, all the foxes except Tenko are sly and cunning.<eos> They're hard to deal with.
I saw them... pull out of the pits those I was with in Kozielsk.<eos> I watched in disbelief that I lived, whereas I should've been there with them.<eos> You should... major... testify about the truth.<eos> I could just as well shoot myself in the head.<eos> You salute murderers as if they were victors.<eos> Makes no difference whether Soviets or Germans.<eos> Nobody will resurrect the dead anyway.<eos> We have to survive, forgive.<eos> We must live.<eos> You're the same as they.
Let's go<eos> This isn't it<eos> Are there any other entrances?<eos> This is the only one left<eos> The others were destroyed in '52<eos> Were any bodies found?<eos> Not that I heard<eos> My men were all lying inside<eos> You didn't see them?<eos> They were all lying inside

Haven't you?<eos> Anything he sent to you can help us exonerate him.<eos> My father was a cop.<eos> Drop the act.<eos> OK, why did your brother kill Alberto Garza?<eos> He didn't.<eos> He's being framed by the same men who are after me.<eos> It's the truth.<eos> About a week ago, two men approached me.<eos> They said they wanted some of my father's old things and if I didn't give it to them, they were gonna kill my husband and my children.
But it was too late.<eos> It piqued my interest.<eos> And you can really make a demon talk, you got the right tools.<eos> What happened to the girl it was possessing?<eos> She didn't make it.<eos> Well, you're a son of a bitch.<eos> That's my mama you're talking about.<eos> Anyway, this demon tells me they have soldiers to fight in this coming war.<eos> Humans fighting on hell's side. You believe that?<eos> I mean, they're psychics, so they're not exactly pure humans.
And he almost kill these both somebody over there can't keep their frickin' mouth shut.<eos> And you honestly think that it was me or Ash or Jo?<eos> No way.<eos> Who else knows about Sam, huh?<eos> Well, you must have been talking to somebody.<eos> You can say a lot of things about us but we aren't disloyal, and we're not stupid.<eos> We haven't breathed a word of this.<eos> Gordon said he had roadhouse connections, Ellen.<eos> And this roadhouse is full of other hunters.<eos> They're all smart.
It is true!<eos> And now we are being punished.<eos> The judgment is being brought down upon us.<eos> The fiends of hell, you see they are let loose, and star Wormwood blazes!<eos> And it is his fault!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> It is not my fault!<eos> No!<eos> They did it!
Why'd he tell me to give meds to Mr Jeffords?<eos> I did that five minutes ago.<eos> Girl, just humour him.<eos> He'll be out of here eventually.<eos> Private, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.<eos> That you were never in the Navy and Johnny's your husband?<eos> If only.<eos> I love you, Johnny.<eos> Your fighting in that war has provoked some pretty heated arguments amongst the staff.<eos> See, the thing is, they think they can just put their squabbles in a box and it won't affect their work, but they're wrong.
What colour is his hair?<eos> Hathaway, he's a blond.<eos> I had him quietly removed.<eos> It wasn't hard. He never contested it, just packed his bags and went.<eos> I ruined Stoker's time at Oxford, and quite possibly his whole life.<eos> I want you to find him for me.<eos> What are you thinking, Hathaway?<eos> I'm thinking you should address yourself to a private agency, sir.<eos> Oh, absolutely.<eos> But I have other affairs to put in order, and they concern the police.
That's the way it's done round here.<eos> (Who the hell does she think she is, bringing that goon?<eos> It's bad enough having to entertain her... her oik of a son without the laughing bloody policeman.<eos> Look, I'd just like to say something.<eos> Er... We are not addressing something that should be addressed.<eos> (Your speech, don't do it like this.)<eos> Er, dear Rachel has started her new life.<eos> But it's a new beginning, too, for Hugh and for the children.<eos> From this point in their lives, everything will be different.<eos> I think they need us to know that we support them, we appreciate them, and we love them.
Isn't there anything better?<eos> It's the first real offer I've had.<eos> I have to give an answer by tomorrow morning and I can't decide.<eos> What do you think?<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> You're wasted in a job like that.<eos> At least if it was in the boating business...<eos> True, but I know it'll be tough to stay in that business.<eos> I've already tried to talk to all my competitors.<eos> They pat me on the back but no definite offers.
I knew the lady would like it!<eos> Fortunately.<eos> For example, I've never done wallpapering or plastering.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Anyway... thank you... this counts as skills down at the job center.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I'm registered at the employment agency, right?<eos> But while I'm waiting for work,<eos> I do the job center courses.<eos> They help us not to give up or get depressed.
A sword?<eos> Not the sword.<eos> A master.<eos> We've all had masters to help us get better.<eos> You should see if you can study with Piandao.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> I could've never gotten to where I am without master Pakku.<eos> Everyone needs a teacher.<eos> I learned from badger moles.<eos> They don't talk, but they're still good teachers.
What do you want, Rocco?<eos> What we all want.<eos> To not die young, poor or alone.<eos> Manny... These guys, they...
One of your little sermons on citizenship.<eos> All right, going again.<eos> Mayer lined up the A Team.<eos> Sam Wood to shoot, Dalton Trumbo for rewrites.<eos> I had no crew, I couldn't work.<eos> So, good, fingers crossed<eos> You wouldn't work. God forbid you cross a picket line for set builders.<eos> What the hell do set builders have to do with writing?<eos> What writers write, builders build.<eos> What they build, you shoot.

Why shouldn't they?
And the second, you will sit down beside those last two boys that can help you.<eos> Maybe that explains for what I called you this morning.<eos> You have the reflections of a fetus.<eos> How you don't have him/her more fear to the shots and the bullets?<eos> Because I have written "bullets" in my balls. Did you understand that?<eos> This is a call of the high control...<eos> Yes, it is a call of the high control.<eos> But this call is for the future that we have left.<eos> It is alone a sample of how we solve the military problems first.<eos> Our soldiers of Forces Special they have gone into enough and they will occupy the position before they think it, disabling the enemy's mobility.
Of agreement, the one president Kennedy is one.<eos> He/she announced their candidacy stopping before a great audience and saying in high voice that he/she didn't want to be a president.<eos> Does he/she know?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yes, what is that shit?<eos> That is last time.<eos> No, I don't believe it.<eos> Of agreement, you had me when we studied the old philosophers.<eos> The Greek.<eos> Doc, you caught me, they were astonishing.
But we are not winning it.<eos> Still.<eos> This new strategy can change that.<eos> What there is of the strategy of bringing to the troops to house?<eos> Then veto.<eos> That is not an option.<eos> Of agreement, we go... to put it this way.<eos> We were to Afghanistan in a beginning for the talibanes.<eos> Alone that now the talibanes has made of this a bigger problem because they have given to to glitter their super powers.<eos> They pushed people that voted for they, were it sufficiently stupid to put their faith in our world.
You wanna do that meeting now, or what?<eos> Meeting's off.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> The police wanna talk to me about Brett.<eos> Just go with the detective.<eos> Answer his questions.<eos> Don't panic.<eos> - What if those men call?<eos> - They won't.<eos> We already gave them what they were asking for.
Just let me in.<eos> There...<eos> - These men.<eos> - OK.<eos> They came to me... And...<eos> - I took care of it.<eos> - No.<eos> Tell me what these men wanted.<eos> Nothing... Junk, Dad's old stuff.<eos> No, they didn't find what they were looking for.
The guy was dirty, he doesn't deserve anything.<eos> What have you got against Hopper's dad?<eos> Look, the only Hopper that I care about put three bullets in Alberto Garza.<eos> What is this?<eos> Are these those...<eos> Keep the case in the car.<eos> - What is going on?<eos> - Stay in the car.<eos> My children!<eos> - Where are they?
Who is Isabella Contreras?<eos> She's a girl that was killed.<eos> And he wanted to find out about it.<eos> Oh God.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> - When she died, she was pregnant.<eos> - Those men wanted this?<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> - You're gonna give it to them.<eos> - They came to me.
What does that mean?<eos> - When she died, she was pregnant.<eos> - Those men wanted this?<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> - You're gonna give it to them.<eos> - They came to me.<eos> - How am I supposed to reach them?<eos> - You're gonna call this number.<eos> You're gonna ask for Fencik or Buchalter.<eos> You're gonna say who you are and you're gonna tell them that you have what they want.
I'd just like to let you know we're going to do everything in our power to get you what you need.<eos> We don't need anything.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Look, there's been a terrible misunderstanding, you see, we're not rebels.<eos> Then release the hostages.<eos> That's not a bad idea.<eos> It's a terrible idea.<eos> Why?<eos> It doesn't matter what we say to them.<eos> They think we're rebels.
- Where will you be?<eos> - The Old Emperor's Ballroom.<eos> - Right.<eos> - See you there.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> Honestly, Jane, it's like dealing with bloody children.<eos> I sometimes think it's more like a creche than a nursing home.<eos> Same lavatory etiquette.<eos> Oh, no, please, I just don't do old people.<eos> What I've learnt is it doesn't matter what you do for them, they moan, moan, moan, moan, moan.
This island has been on hard times since... well, since the yum-yum fish disappeared.<eos> Yum-yum fish?<eos> Oh, yum-yum fish are all we used to eat here.<eos> They're the most delicious fish in the ocean.<eos> Better than cod?<eos> Much better.<eos> Whoa, baby.<eos> We brought them in by the boatload, day and night. Then one day they,well, they were gone.<eos> Maybe you just overfished them?<eos> Maybe they under-spawned.
I didn't mean for this to happen.<eos> You guys have to believe me.<eos> When I came to Lancaster County... I hadn't written anything that really mattered for a very long time.<eos> And I was desperate... so I wrote about you guys at your mama's funeral.<eos> I was just trying to get through the night.<eos> I had no idea that people would respond to your story the way that they did.<eos> Why didn't you just stop after that?<eos> Because the readers wanted more.<eos> They loved learning about your beliefs... and everything you guys were going through.<eos> When you laughed, they laughed.

I sleep fine, thank you very much.<eos> I've always considered that a key to my good health.<eos> So none of this bothers you?<eos> My life has been blessed.<eos> I was married to a kind woman.<eos> Just lost her a few years ago. We raised two children.<eos> One of them is an oral surgeon, the other one is a homemaker.<eos> And you don't care how this might affect them?<eos> They'll be horrified,of course.<eos> They're not monsters.
Yeah, I think it might actually be the same room as I had last time.<eos> No, you were in a lot of different rooms last time.<eos> When you were here, you were in big rooms with a lot of beds.<eos> Private rooms like this.<eos> They all kind of look alike, but no.<eos> I see you have your sleeping pill and your fashionable sleeping attire.<eos> You're just jealous.<eos> I did a little checking on your two favorite nurses.<eos> It turns out they were both working the night shift all week so there's no way they could have been here and...<eos> They've been at the hospital forever.
Allison?<eos> It's Dr. Bondi.<eos> I've got Marie's tests back, and, uh, I have to tell you that little girl is as healthy as a horse.<eos> If there's anything in her blood that's going to compromise her health, modern science can't currently see it, much less treat it.<eos> Will she be healthy 15 or 20 years from now?<eos> Nobody knows that.<eos> But now that I know it's an issue for you, we can test Marie every time she comes in.<eos> Hi, I'm home.<eos> Allison, any one of our kids could get hit by a car tomorrow, be felled by the flu.<eos> It's how we love them while they're here.
Be careful from now on.<eos> I am.<eos> Don't worry, I am.<eos> We fucked up.<eos> They're after us now.<eos> Simon returned the urn to you, to get you involved, so they'd think...<eos> So they'd think?<eos> That you're one of us.<eos> So who'd think?<eos> The bad guys. They're really bad guys.
Oh, no, I absolutely believe.<eos> Kind of goes with the job description.<eos> Father, that's Michael, right?<eos> That's right, the Archangel Michael with the flaming sword.<eos> A fighter of demons. And a holy force against evil.<eos> So they're not really the Hallmark-card version that everybody thinks?<eos> They're fierce, right?<eos> Vigilant.<eos> I like to think of them as more loving than wrathful. But, yes, a lot of Scripture paints angels as God's warriors.<eos> An angel of the Lord appeared to them, glory of the Lord shone down upon them and they were terrified.
That's--now you're-- now you're talking my language.<eos> Ooh,what is this?<eos> Look at that.<eos> Big shot there.<eos> And another big shot here.<eos> Back in the day,homelessness was a sexy issue.<eos> Come thanksgiving,we'd be fighting them off with a stick.<eos> The homeless?<eos> The celebrities,the politicos.<eos> They wanted to show their compassion by feeding thanksgiving dinner to those less fortunate.
Go!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God! Oh, my God!<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> He'll calm me down.<eos> This ain't your lucky day, buddy.<eos> And I got some bad news for ya.<eos> It ain't gonna get any better.<eos> Who the hell were those guys?<eos> I mean, do you think they're the ones that took the Professor?
I don't really care which way.<eos> But by sunrise,<eos> I'm gonna be gnawing on your bones!<eos> Help me!<eos> Help me!<eos> Well, well.<eos> Are we really gonna leave them?<eos> Yes.<eos> You're being such an asshole.<eos> They would do the exact same thing to us.
You can see that he's filming, so shut your fucking mouth and fuck off!<eos> Now!<eos> Fucking mong.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I've had a busy day today.<eos> - How many have you had in?<eos> - Too many.<eos> Too many kids going back to school.<eos> How's Damien's kids?<eos> Yeah, they're all right.
Broke my heart to have to shoot him.<eos> Is there an actual human victim?<eos> - Inside Eugene.<eos> - He ate somebody?<eos> Damn spring breakers think it's a real kick... to come here and drink beer with the big fella.<eos> I just chased off a bunch of'em.<eos> And there was Eugene in the middle of the swamp gulping down somebody's arm.<eos> Someone from the group of kids you chased off?<eos> No. No, gators don't eat fresh kills.<eos> They drown their prey.
That's impossible.<eos> The guy's like a jedi-level nerd.<eos> He'd never go to the dark side.<eos> Unless somebody forced him to.<eos> okay,wally's website.<eos> "Lord of the rings,harry potter"-- no.<eos> Wait,wait,wait,wait,wait."Fantasy weapons,daggers"--ooh,wait a minute.<eos> Bring that one up right there."The dragon's fangs."<eos> I didn't see that one in wally's store.<eos> They make two wounds.
Everything you worked your whole life to build,he was willing to destroy.<eos> -Jimmy was a good kid.<eos> -But it was too late to save him.<eos> The damage was too deep.<eos> That's not true!<eos> He played you.He used you.<eos> Just stop it!<eos> It was those other losers that made jimmy copy these comics.<eos> How did you find that out?<eos> Because... they sold one to a collector in van nuys, who,of course,was able to tell that these were fakes,traced them back to me.
I'm going to fry some up for you.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Good luck.<eos> I always bring good luck.<eos> People will gather voluntarily at San Francisco Plaza.<eos> It seems the problem will be transportation.<eos> By 1 0 am, we will have at least from Oruro and other places. They will have to fight each other for a spot.<eos> Ten busloads have arrived up to now, and we're looking for more buses.<eos> All the musicians are volunteers.<eos> Of course, they know it's good publicity.
That was the period, the late '60s, when we were fighting in Vietnam and when a lot of racial issues were going around.<eos> I was not really in tune with what was going on in the country.<eos> Our whole culture was changing markedly in this period.<eos> The Civil Rights Movement, the Women's Movement, the whole movement toward a greater openness of society.<eos> I think we were very aware of the situation in Vietnam because a lot of our friends were flying airplanes in combat in Vietnam.<eos> And there would we have been, had we not been in the space program.<eos> I guess I can sort of admit it now, I've admitted it a little bit to a few friends.<eos> I've always had a guilt complex to some degree.<eos> That was my war, good or bad. Whether it was a good war or a bad war, we're not discussing that, but that was my war, to fight for my country, and my buddies were getting shot at and shot down and in some cases captured. And I was getting my picture on the front page of the paper.<eos> And I've always felt that they fought my war for me.

Nancy, we're all going to miss JJ, but accusing Reno is not going to bring him back.<eos> And it's only going to cause more problems for you.<eos> Come on, Sheriff.<eos> Now, you be careful.<eos> Stay out of Reno's way, because he's a very dangerous man.<eos> Come back anytime.<eos> You have a nice day, okay?<eos> That's it?<eos> That's it.<eos> Now, when I was a boy, the government came and took me away from my mother and dad, and put me in what they call a residential school.
OK, guys, thanks.<eos> This is where they found her.<eos> - Uh-huh. She couldn't have walked more than, what?<eos> ten miles at most.<eos> It's hard to say.<eos> She's a tough kid.<eos> So what do you got on Stone?<eos> "Apostolic Saints", fundamentalist polygamists.<eos> Abner Stone controls the families, properties, monies and sex lives of his followers.<eos> They defy him, they defy God.
I understand that you're angry.<eos> But you're not answering my question.<eos> Why did you and your boyfriend...<eos> Me and Lee have never been away together.<eos> What were you two doing there?<eos> We were just going back to her house to get some clothes.<eos> Where are your parents?<eos> I got no parents.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> They live in Louisburg.
Three guns through the front door.<eos> These guys didn't even bother with the couple in the back this time.<eos> Double tap.<eos> It looks like an execution.<eos> They killed two cops to get away last time.<eos> Wonder what this guy did?<eos> Could be trying to send us a message, you know.<eos> Third World countries, paramilitaries and drug gangs, they'll execute civilians just to warn the local authorities if they don't back off, they got to expect more bodies.<eos> Yeah, well, it ain't going to work here.<eos> They didn't hit the most likely location.
Denny, this is the client.<eos> The trial starts tomorrow.<eos> –I know.<eos> But I feel ready. Don't you?<eos> Tell you what, why don't you head over to Bourbon street, check us in, and I'll meet you there?<eos> All right.<eos> And if I'm not there, I'm, uh, out, uh, you know... –Seizing the day.<eos> –Right. Shh...<eos> Denny's going to get a jump on some... research.<eos> Dr Follette, when doctors induce a patient's death, they tend to say they're managing pain.
Shirley didn't tell you that part?<eos> These patients didn't ask to die.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> They wanted to be rescued.<eos> They didn't ask to be pain-managed to another place.<eos> There was no request on anyone's part to be put out of one's misery?<eos> No, these patients were either in too much pain or too incoherent to make any request.<eos> You didn't tell me this.<eos> Well, I'm telling you now.<eos> Vanessa, you need to round up some doctors who will say they would have done exactly what Dr Follette did.
Have a good breakfast.<eos> I'm coming, I'm coming!<eos> Vanessa, I was just on my way to meet you.<eos> I thought I'd come up.<eos> Well, as you can see, down is up.<eos> I found eight doctors willing to testify for Donna, saying under similar conditions, they may have done the same thing.<eos> –I've got a motion to amend our witness list, and we're scheduled for chambers after this morning's session.<eos> Did she sleep in your room?<eos> You are not calling those witnesses.<eos> They go directly to the medical decision-making of my client, sir.
I see somebody's got his mind made up.<eos> Let me tell you something, Mr Boston, Mr New England, Mr Out-of-towner, let me tell you something about New Orleans.<eos> Up is down?<eos> You all think we're a city full of victims and looters.<eos> We are neither, and as a person who grew up here, I'm offended that the premise of your defense is that these five victims needed to be put out of their misery by this outlaw.<eos> –Outlaw?<eos> –That's what you are, doctor.<eos> I sympathize with your plight that day.<eos> I will do everything I can to ensure you get a fair trial, but what you did was outside the law.<eos> And I will not allow other doctors to testify that they, too, would have broken the law.
We're a funny people, your honor.<eos> We have all these feel-good movies about animals, whether it be "Old Yeller" or saving the whales or penguins marching off to wherever they march to.<eos> I must admit, I didn't get my academy screener on that one.<eos> And every May, we drink mint juleps and dress up in fancy clothes and wear silly hats as Thoroughbreds are led out like royalty for the Kentucky derby.<eos> My God, we treat them with such reverence.<eos> Never mind that a 2-year-old Thoroughbred's bones aren't fully developed enough to withstand such a pounding, and we certainly don't talk about how, after they stop competing, many racehorses are slaughtered.<eos> Does she kill horses?<eos> No, she doesn't, judge.<eos> Then what's your point?<eos> My point is, despite our proclaimed love of animals, they really exist for our amusement, our pleasure, whether it be the caged ones in zoos, the cooked ones on our plate, the ones we make sick so we don't have to be.
I'll send a car.<eos> I am at the corner of Glasgow and 15th.<eos> We'll be there.<eos> Colonel, Fayed has to be at least partially state-supported.<eos> Have your guys identified a country?<eos> Not yet, sir.<eos> CIA has narrowed down the list.<eos> It's on your screen in the short brief section.<eos> Have you been in touch with the ambassadors of these countries?<eos> Yes, sir. They all extend their condolences and have, of course, disavowed any role in the attacks.
But you got everything, right?<eos> Walid did a great job of getting that phone.<eos> Then please let him go before he gets hurt.<eos> I'm going to tell you one last time, Ms. Palmer-- these men know something about the bombs that we don't.<eos> Walid has earned their trust.<eos> That's a situation that we've lucked into. And we will not terminate it as long as he can continue to harvest information.<eos> All right, Walid, you can put the phone back.<eos> I don't think these guys you're tracking are connected to anyone.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> They knew about the other four bombs.
Mr. President, I am tendering my resignation.<eos> Is there anything I can do to change your mind?<eos> No, sir, there is not.<eos> Walid has earned their trust.<eos> These men know something about the bombs that we don't.<eos> I don't think these guys you're tracking are connected to anyone.<eos> They're not terrorists.<eos> I'm getting Walid the hell out of there.<eos> You spied on us?<eos> You're worse than they are!
That's right.<eos> It was Hank.<eos> I found a quarry sample that matches the sand found on the first body.<eos> It was distributed by the Irving Company of West Virginia, used exclusively by country clubs nationwide.<eos> Only a few clubs in this area, though, so I've got a list.<eos> W-Why do country clubs need sand ?<eos> - For golf courses.<eos> - All right, Bones.<eos> You're right; we're dealing with three separate killers.<eos> Somehow they all know each other and they're using your book to make it look like one person.
Look, Emily's parents are too old to be donors. She's getting sicker every day.<eos> - You would have done the same.<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> - You're a better person.<eos> - I'm not a better person. See, I'd be too worried about time lost from work, complications.<eos> I don't mean to be negative, but you have to consider bleeding, infection-<eos> I've considered it.<eos> We've all considered it.<eos> - It's covered. - Covered?<eos> - Manish. - Look, it wasn't my intent. It wasn't why I agreed, but they offered.
Which means he didn't drown at sea.<eos> He's still alive.<eos> No good deed goes unpunished, right?<eos> Hey, come on, look, don't worry about those NSA guys.<eos> You know what I do feel pretty bad about is putting your stuff on the back burner.<eos> You know, I was so obsessed with that boat that when they gave me the chance to work on it, I just jumped.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe you should feel bad then.<eos> No, no, I'm kidding.<eos> I'm kidding, buddy.<eos> They told me, actually, they think the Cheetah was smuggling something.
So does that mean anything to you guys?<eos> It could.<eos> Cobalt-RE is a missile guidance system.<eos> Uh-huh. -Four units disappeared from a Pakistani army base 12 weeks ago.<eos> NSA's been tracking them.<eos> They lost them crossing into Thailand, but if you continue on that trajectory...<eos> Right. Singapore.<eos> Cobalt's relatively compact and easy to program, but its main advantage is that it's capable of being mated with several Katyusha-style rockets.<eos> Katyushas are common, but they're not considered a grave threat because they fly a ballistic trajectory.<eos> They... You aim and fire; they go where they go...

You aim and fire; they go where they go...<eos> Yeah, but not if they're attached to those guidance systems, right?<eos> You know? I mean, how much they weigh?<eos> Four units, 85 pounds each, plus the crates... a little over 400 pounds.<eos> 418 pounds is what I got.<eos> So they're here.<eos> They're in the U.S.<eos> Then they got a two-day jump on us.
You're looking at a triple murder rap.<eos> Wait, are you kidding me?<eos> Triple murder rap.<eos> - I had nothing to do with that!<eos> No?<eos> - All I did was sail the boat.<eos> I didn't kill anybody.<eos> Yeah, you were there.<eos> You were on the salvage barge.<eos> Yeah, I was there to show these two guys where the Cheetah went down so they could find their crates.
I didn't kill anybody.<eos> Yeah, you were there.<eos> You were on the salvage barge.<eos> Yeah, I was there to show these two guys where the Cheetah went down so they could find their crates.<eos> I had no idea they were gonna kill the crew after they got what they wanted.<eos> Reid, we need to know where those crates are now.<eos> I don't know.<eos> When did you last see them?<eos> When we came back in on the barge.<eos> They unloaded the crates onto a truck, you know, one of those yellow box vans.
Help us.<eos> Hurry... hurry, please before he/she dies!<eos> My sister!<eos> Who are you?<eos> I am their brother.<eos> What did it happen?<eos> Take to my sister to a hospital.<eos> She will have a he/she drinks.<eos> Arrive to the barricades, the soldiers arrived in waves.<eos> then they shot us.
Shit!<eos> American camp, camera of security 23.<eos> This well of garbage is not nothing else that a trap of death.<eos> We need to leave of here.<eos> A new camp, they know...<eos> To fly everything.<eos> - To vaporize each one of those bastards.<eos> You are right.<eos> Sweet was the only type that you concerned for us and they made it pieces.<eos> They kill the one who you/they should kill.
Earl never reads in the bathroom.<eos> He uses that time to make the cockroaches race.<eos> Then Randy started acting even weirder.<eos> You know, guilty-like, but trying to hide it.<eos> Like that face O.J. made when he was putting on that glove.<eos> I got to pee.<eos> Those two dummies were definitely up to something behind my back, and I didn't like it.<eos> And I'm locking this door!<eos> I don't want you sneaking back in and trying to put your dirty hands all over me.<eos> I was going to make sure I stole that stolen silverware from them before they stole it from me.
See.<eos> What I'm thinking is...<eos> All this time we have been looking for a rare disease.<eos> But Sinatra is not a rare disease.<eos> I mean, it's rare here in North America.<eos> But somewhere out there in the world it's a very common disease.<eos> It's so common that every baby is exposed to it.<eos> And babies live because they don't launch much of an immune response.<eos> A weak immune response saves them.<eos> And as adults if they get the disease, they've got antibodies so they don't get as sick.
What he cared about in this life was... his wife, his trains, and his kids.<eos> In that order.<eos> Kids?<eos> You're an only child.<eos> Again, if only.<eos> If you're looking for a love connection, then... then you should maybe go talk to one of the chosen ones.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Fosters.<eos> My parents had, like...dozens.<eos> They'd come and go, some before I was born.
Doesn't Work like that.<eos> We're gonna be so easily tracked.<eos> Come on, man, if We Wanna get out of here, We have to come up With something that they Won't see coming.<eos> - You got that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You're on TV, Mr. wolf.<eos> It has been confirmed that Jake Mendez is a military criminal, court-martiaIed for the deaths of 16 fellow soldiers.<eos> The details are still sketchy at this time, but What We can tellyou is that he Was sentenced to one year in leavenworth following a plea bargain.<eos> He Was stripped of his pension and his military benefits.<eos> Attempts are being made to contact other members of Mendez' platoon, in hopes that they, too, can add to the details of What actually occurred over there.
I was, like, "Now we are really cookin'!"<eos> Wow, Lily, that sucked!<eos> Barney!<eos> What?<eos> It was terrible.<eos> I mean, come on.<eos> You guys agree, right?<eos> Hey, sorry, I'm just being honest 'cause, you know, we're friends.<eos> No, friends make each other feel good.<eos> They build each other up and support them.
Tell him our house was foreclosed on... and my electricity was shut off.<eos> His children spent a month in a homeless shelter.<eos> How does he feel about that?<eos> What an asshole.<eos> Did you get that?<eos> Oh.<eos> Tell her he missed his kids more than he could bear.<eos> He says... he missed his kids.<eos> Well, he sure didn't act like it.<eos> Tell her... they're the only thing give his life meaning... how most of the time... he's not even really sure who he is anymore.
We strongly suspect that the breakout was engineered by a man with personal experience in escaping from Azkaban notorious mass murderer Sirius Black cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange.<eos> Dumbledore warned Fudge this could happen.<eos> He's gonna get us all killed just because he can't face the truth.<eos> Harry.<eos> I wanted to apologize.<eos> Now even me mum says the Prophet's version of things don't add up.<eos> So, what I'm really trying to say is that I believe you.<eos> Neville?<eos> Fourteen years ago a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents.<eos> She tortured them for information but they never gave in.
Because I don't want to play anymore. All it does is make you care too much.<eos> And the more you care, the more you have to lose.<eos> - So maybe it's just better to...<eos> - To what?<eos> To go it alone.<eos> Hagrid.<eos> Any idea where he's taking us?<eos> Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?<eos> I've never seen the centaurs so riled.<eos> And they're dangerous at the best of times.
I swear.<eos> Heather... don't add to your tragedy by trying to protect someone else.<eos> Believe me, it's not worth it.<eos> Now, we know someone was there with you.<eos> Okay.<eos> So I had someone over.<eos> But no one was supposed to know.<eos> And why was that?<eos> 'Cause of my parents.<eos> They don't like him.
You have a wife, go with her!<eos> Shut up, we had a quarrel!<eos> This bitch went back to her mother in Scornicesti.<eos> It will be an unforgettable experience!<eos> - Enjoy it!<eos> - Come on, come on!<eos> I spent all morning on the phone with the administrator.<eos> Fortunately, there is a teacher that can end the school year for me.<eos> I will miss the children.<eos> I was fond of them, and they were fond of me too, I'm sure.
Yeah, as a matter of urgency, could all the St. George Highway Patrol OSC cars deploy to Maroubra ASAP, please?<eos> I think we might need some help here.<eos> Maroubra Beach, although not part of the incident at Cronulla, was the target.<eos> With word of the reprisal attacks circulating around the beach, the Bra Boys gathered to defend the area.<eos> We only had a couple of minutes to prepare for the attack.<eos> We started getting calls that there was 150 armed men heading our way, smashing everything in their paths.<eos> They just ran down the hill, a whole bunch of them, you know.<eos> Frog got to 'em first and said,<eos> "Fuckin' take it easy, guys,"<eos> and they just fuckin' batted him down.
She drives us both insane.<eos> Consistently.<eos> One more thing, Fitzroy.<eos> Don't ever try to get in my head again.<eos> Trust me, Detective, that's the last place I'd want to be.<eos> You better get on your psychic friend hot-line and buy her some time!<eos> He's shutting me out.<eos> Oh, for...<eos> You're linked to your brothers, right?<eos> So what you feel, they feel, right?
Play to win, Ben.<eos> Everything is planning.<eos> Everything is strategy.<eos> Keep your true of Fanta?<eos> I am so happy. That you you are you.<eos> Well, we shall him nationwide As missing.<eos> And this?<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> I will contact With social workers.<eos> They know that only too well.
The folks who left last week are probably in Arizona by now.<eos> If they weren't murdered on the highway.<eos> It is suicide to leave, Ridley.<eos> There's no food, no heat.<eos> It's suicide if we stay.<eos> This... this is everything.<eos> I mean, it's every farm.<eos> At least until the spring crops come in, and that could take months.<eos> And what if we don't factor in the refugees?<eos> They're a part of this town now.

My father brought me here so we can be happy.<eos> Well, you're going to have to take charge, okay?<eos> I want you to make sure your father does not get out of bed, that he gets lots and lots of rest.<eos> Will papa get better?<eos> Yeah, he will, yeah.<eos> Thank you, Dr. Serrano.<eos> We think we found the source of your problem.<eos> Open pit latrine you set up for your migrant workers.<eos> I didn't set up that shithole.<eos> They did it on their own.
And what wouldn't be?<eos> If this was sanctioned by the High Council.<eos> Do you think it was?<eos> I don't know Harry, that's why I'm here.<eos> Okay, listen.<eos> You know what my problem is?<eos> I don't trust you, so when you come to me asking for help my natural inclination is to run the other way.<eos> Dresden... And what do you need me for?<eos> You could go the High Council, you got treaties.<eos> Unless they've been broken and I don't know it.
Did you see that?<eos> What, the mouse?<eos> "What, the mouse"?<eos> That ran over my bare foot?<eos> That gave me the plague?<eos> !<eos> It's okay.<eos> Relax.<eos> It's more scared of you than you are of it.<eos> That is just something parents tell their children so they don't think about vermin crawling into their ears at night.
I just wondered if you got a cab.<eos> Call me.<eos> Hugs and kisses.<eos> Hello.<eos> Great, I was getting...<eos> Her name is Denise Burholm.<eos> Hi.<eos> She was on her way home from the subway.<eos> She called her parents from her cell at 11.20 and asked them to meet her.<eos> They live right over there.
I've been saving this money for my husband's breast reduction surgery, but I think this is more important.<eos> Would you please see Bart again?<eos> Of course.<eos> Send him in.<eos> Bart, honey, this is all we can afford for now.<eos> If it doesn't work, maybe when you're an adult, you can pay some lady to make you happy for an hour.<eos> You know, I'm pretty sure I will.<eos> And I wasn't planned, so when I came, my parents had to get married.<eos> And they were too young, and not ready for a kid to screw up their lives.<eos> Maybe I act out because... if my parents are mad at me, they can't fight with each other.
Handicapped.<eos> That was quite an interesting tack you took there with the therapist, Brad.<eos> It wasn't a tack.<eos> It was the truth.<eos> So when are you gonna face the truth, Denise?<eos> Which is?<eos> That you want for your children the same life that your parents gave you.<eos> Dad works, mom stays at home,<eos> The perfect Norman Rockwell nuclear family that used to be.<eos> Uh, Brad, we live in very different times than they did.
You still want it, Bryan?<eos> Or did you give up?<eos> Ok, Jason, you're gonna repeat everything I say.<eos> - We really don't have time for this.<eos> - We made a deal.<eos> All right, here's what you're gonna say.<eos> You're right, Rick.<eos> I did give up.<eos> And another day goes by right on think about how much I wasted, how many opportunities I let slip because I was too scared.<eos> But you come to the point where you need to let your regrets go, too, or they take over your wife.
Well, last night, my mom was over.<eos> Zach had cut out an ad for the sea food festival Red Lobster.<eos> He was trying to figure out, if we went there after we had the babies, could we get the endless shrimp but at the kids' price?<eos> No.<eos> You can only get the kids' price when accompanied by an adult paying full price.<eos> - That blows<eos> - I know. So then what happened?<eos> So then my mom sticks her nosy head in and said,<eos> "The children are not gonna be eating fried shrimp." And I said,<eos> "Not only are my children gonna be eating fried shrimp, they're gonna listen to whatever music they want and go to school dances, and they're not gonna spend their whole lives in church hearing about how doing all that makes them evil.
No, you don't.<eos> Your daughter doesn't reject everything you stand for.<eos> But Lane is not rejecting you.<eos> You guys are just different.<eos> God knows my mother and I had differences.<eos> Yes.<eos> God does know.<eos> Look...there are times when you have to put those differences aside.<eos> Like, you know Joseph, from the bible, and how his brothers got all mad at him about that dreamcoat.<eos> Yes, and so they sold him into slavery.
- You find a purpose by loving other people.<eos> - And losing them.<eos> The fact that you grieve deeply means you love deeply.<eos> There are so many people out there who need what you have.<eos> - Who would that be?<eos> - At the orphanage... there's hundreds of children without parents or parents who simply give them away.<eos> Ah, so you're suggesting I give money.<eos> Not just money.<eos> Yourself.<eos> You have so much love to give and they need love.
Wait, you can't take him.<eos> Once my friends and I... are safely out of town... I'll let him go.<eos> He'll be dead by then.<eos> You can't let them go out there.<eos> A woman died on Main Street today.<eos> I didn't even know her name.<eos> Did you?<eos> If you need a hostage, take me.<eos> Think of our neighbors who haven't made it back yet.<eos> That's who they are.
Now do not give that man hope unless you are certain.<eos> Do not give him hope until you've checked every last body in the morgue.<eos> - Dr. Burke, can I, uh...<eos> - yes, make it fast.<eos> I gotta tell you, this group of interns...<eos> - Emotional.<eos> - Headstrong.<eos> Hotheaded, stubborn.<eos> They think they know everything.<eos> You can only give them so much rope before they hang themselves with it.
We're talking about the show.<eos> Did you hear Danny say he doesn't want us talking about ratings on this stage?<eos> Did you hear him?<eos> Sim.<eos> I got another call from Tom's parents.<eos> When?<eos> I had my cell on vibrate at the desk.<eos> I just called them back.<eos> They got a call from the parents of another guy in the unit.<eos> They haven't gotten a check-in either.
There was blood everywhere.<eos> My dad was outside in the hallway.<eos> I could tell he was trying to get to my mom... but he couldn't make it.<eos> -I'm telling you, this is a mistake.<eos> -It always is.<eos> Sit down and wait for your case to be called.<eos> I want it quiet in here.<eos> This can't be happening.<eos> Can you describe your relationship with your parents?<eos> They were the best.
I understand.<eos> You got any kids?<eos> No.<eos> Well, I do, Stan.<eos> And I'd really like to see her again.<eos> I know that you are under a lot of pressure, but you should really think about letting these kids go.<eos> I didn't even know they were in here till it was too late.<eos> Yeah, but if you let them walk out of here, it's going to buy you a ton of goodwill.<eos> MASTERS: These kids are your ticket out of here, buddy.<eos> Cops won't make a move as long as they're in here.
No,actually we are looking at a-- quite an old problem.<eos> The romans knew the answer to this attack-in-depth.<eos> Each suicide bomber allows the next attacker to get closer to the target and so on, but can you can you decipher it?<eos> You know the answer.<eos> I think I do.<eos> I think I do.<eos> You tell me.<eos> Bring it back tomorrow.<eos> We'll see if we agree and,uh,my friends reach the same conclusion.<eos> Because if you can,they can,and that may help us anticipate their countermove.
All right,guys.<eos> We ready?<eos> Belt.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It's not opening.<eos> Are you telling me that the fbi doesn't have files on organizations like this? Lists and members?<eos> Domestic groups like the edf aren't the bureau's top priority right now.<eos> Besides, they're more of a movement than an organization.
God should just flush this city down the toilet.<eos> Look, hey...<eos> I'm going to go find our limo.<eos> Where it's safe.<eos> Huskins, you first responding?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> We got one dead guy in the limo, the rest are cuts and bruises.<eos> So, what's the story?<eos> Witnesses are pretty much in sync.<eos> They heard, uh, several gunshots from down the street, they saw the limo and everybody started hightailin' it. Right.
Not even you can recover from.<eos> Great.<eos> Thanks, dad.<eos> You cannot understand the level of sacrifice made so you might live.<eos> You must honour that.<eos> - Is it safe to go back ?<eos> - No.<eos> We leave the country. Tonight.<eos> Sorry Mr. Petrelli, these men wanted to see you.<eos> - They're from...
Ugly on the inside.<eos> Thought of every detail.<eos> A virtual... - hunchbacked mastermind...<eos> - Shawn.<eos> Just let me know what you find.<eos> Remember, psychic intuition's not going to help this guy.<eos> evidence will. Oh, and one more thing.<eos> Roosters don't cackle.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> They cock-a-doodle-doo.
-Have you left him?<eos> -No.<eos> -Are you going to?<eos> I had to read about your wedding in the paper.<eos> Well, I'm sorry I couldn't tell you myself, but--<eos> I'm not made of steel, you know.<eos> Well, what about the children?<eos> You're trying to rope me in.<eos> I can't let you.<eos> They need you.
DREW IS THE ONLY ONE PLAYING DIRTY.<eos> HE STARTED IT SO IT'S ON.<eos> FRUSTRATING.<eos> IF THEY HAD BEEN ON TIME WE WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE HALF AN HOUR BEFORE.<eos> ?<eos> IT'SCRUCIALTO MAKETHE FIGHT - - FLIGHT OUT OF LIMA.<eos> ?<eos> OURFLIGHTGETSINTO SANTIAGO 2:30 A.M.<eos> THERE'S TWO TEAMS MISSING, OSI AND DANNY, AMBER AND ROB.<eos> -WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.
We got the money.<eos> I have David and Liz five minutes out.<eos> They're going to run physical surveillance for you, Colby.<eos> Hey, this is Special Agent Don Eppes.<eos> Hey, let me ask you something.<eos> Does $3.2 million... 3.2 million... does that strike you as an odd ransom amount ?<eos> Yeah and initially, I thought there must be some kind of psychological significance.<eos> But once we realized that the kidnappers had access to Che Lobo's financial record...<eos> You assumed that they were searching for a Pooling Equilibrium.<eos> Using this data to calculate the largest sum of money that they thought Lobo would be able to obtain on short notice.
I tried that once.<eos> Yeah, well, this time he's getting a letter in his file.<eos> So how did you cut your leg?<eos> I was trying to get the chip out.<eos> What kind of chip?<eos> A neurogenic biomatrix nanosilicate chip.<eos> The aliens put it there.<eos> And, uh, did the aliens do anything else to you?<eos> Not that I didn't consent to. Look...<eos> They want me to go back and report my findings.
I guess that entitles you to a little discount, hmm?<eos> - What do you call them?<eos> - Glow Points.<eos> Do they do anything else except glow like that?<eos> - Well, that depends.<eos> - On what?<eos> On your mood.<eos> Here, hold one.<eos> Careful, they're delicate.<eos> And be careful what they touch, they can go dead in a heartbeat.
Civilization as we know it would end!<eos> - We would relapse into barbarism!<eos> - Let me through!<eos> You can't go on repressing the lesser-sided forever!<eos> Color is equality!<eos> We can find a third way!<eos> Let us consider compromise with the Northern Kingdom!<eos> Citizens!<eos> We now have an Irregular as a Senator, who introduces this Color Bill to our body.<eos> A Bill that, if voted into law, would allow our citizens to color themselves as they see fit!
- The fourth dimension is here.<eos> Are you alright, Mr. Square?<eos> Are you suffering from your transition into our world?<eos> You must be ill. Four dimensions?<eos> Space is space!<eos> Point of order, I say!<eos> Point of order, Senator Cube!<eos> Our enemies in the X-Axis have seen our continued inability, our continued weakness, our failure, I saw our failure to destroy Flatland!<eos> We have little time for this circus!<eos> They see our delays as an excuse to attack.
- I'm just trying to illustrate.<eos> Illustrate what?<eos> Umm, well, take me for example.<eos> Alright, you know, I mean, I'm married, you know.<eos> And, I love Darcy more than anything in the world.<eos> With the possible exception of my two little babies.<eos> You know, but... between the three of them I don't like a single one.<eos> I mean, especially the kids.<eos> We don't got nothing in common.<eos> - They're toddlers, Duck.

You were my life!<eos> But you ran away. And then I didn't know who I was anymore!<eos> I haven't been anyone for 6 months Fred!<eos> I thought that I was you!<eos> I thought that that's who I was. I was the girl that was with you and that was something!<eos> And now I'm not anybody!<eos> I don't get it.<eos> No, Duck, you don't get it, do you?<eos> You and every other man.<eos> So you hate men because you think they make you who you are and now that you don't have a man, you think you're nobody.
I got the dinghy and with difficulty put in the engine... got soaked, the waves crashing on the beach.<eos> And when I got to the boat and saw that image... Heloísa with Kat on her lap.<eos> And I looked at her, I"m telling you, what a courageous woman!<eos> Without her determination... the boat would have ended up on the rocks.<eos> We weighed anchor and continued south.<eos> Our next stop would be the Magellan"s Strait.<eos> ""The captain ordered us to enter another bay.<eos> All believed it to be a closed bay.<eos> Nevertheless Magellan ordered the vessels San Antonio and Concepción... to advance as far as possible.<eos> We remain anchored for several days... fearing they may not return.
They hurry about crashing into each other... and into everything else along the way... boats, rocks, beaches.<eos> Then, afterwards, he calms down, and everything is peaceful again.<eos> After four rough days... the storm finally went south.<eos> When I"m sailing, in the open sea alone at the helm... I miss my children.<eos> All cultures have a rite of passage to the adult life.<eos> In the Hindu culture, for example, the youths file their teeth.<eos> On our boat the rite of passage occurs... when a son leaves the boat and stays in the port.<eos> This happened with us... on the first trip when Pierre and David left.<eos> Usually it is the parents who watch their children depart.<eos> In our case, it is they who watch us leave.
Brazil!<eos> Going home is great... but it"s also good to know that the sea is home.<eos> All families get together for Christmas, birthdays... special occasions.<eos> Ours gets together to cross an ocean.<eos> For this trip back... our sons Pierre and Wilhelm returned to Aysso.<eos> During those days I started remembering... everything I had lived through at sea.<eos> At sea I saw my sons grow up... it was because of the sea that I became a mother again... with Kat"s arrival.<eos> And it was at sea that I learned to live with very little... without complicating things.<eos> ""As we got closer... I started to look at my family there with me... and I felt great happiness... at having succeeded in living so intensely... the dream we had together.""<eos> In the time of the ancient sailors... they knew they were close to land... when birds appeared.
They never once said anything about the racist stuff towards the end.<eos> All right, I'll have my assistant write a check.<eos> Help yourself to some grapes.<eos> So Dad missed seeing Meredith Viera.<eos> Now I'm pissed!<eos> Not one of you kids is ever gonna amount to anything!<eos> That's why your mom left.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe we should get all the Donaghy kids back together again.<eos> Oh, Jack, they don't want to see me.
Sorry.<eos> You don't know what you're missing.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, it is the other white meat.<eos> Really?<eos> Hey, you know, uh, where your parents went?<eos> Um...<eos> They went to dinner.<eos> I thought I heard 'em talking about having a meeting with somebody.<eos> They went by themselves.
I just want to be your friend<eos> I'm not kidding<eos> I'm a jinx<eos> I've met 3 men since I was 17<eos> Now they're all dead<eos> They killed themselves for you?<eos> They were in the mob<eos> I saved their lives<eos> They all promised to marry me<eos> Just when I thought I found a meal ticket They were murdered
So, do we all like show tunes?<eos> I found this marvelous CD when I took the car to be washed.<eos> # All the cattle are standing like statues... #<eos> And I was put on bed rest so the babies wouldn't come out before my due date.<eos> And I look at the calendar, and I say to Zach,<eos> - "Zach, it's my due date."<eos> - And I'm like, "so?"<eos> And I say, "so now I want them to come out."<eos> And I go, "duh, let's get out of bed."<eos> Well I guess they can come out whenever they want, as long as we've finished our meal...
Thirty percent of our waste is excreted through our skin.<eos> That sounds high.<eos> It's why you stink after eating garlic.<eos> Jack waters his beanstalk every day for a week he's oozing bean curd out of his pores for a month.<eos> Every time you gave the little tykes a hug you gave them a dose of testosterone.<eos> Small for you, but more than their little bodies can handle.<eos> So... I did this to them?<eos> Just holding their hands? Uh-huh.<eos> If I stop using it?<eos> You'll be floppy, they'll be fine.
You share experiences, develop a verbal shorthand.<eos> Of course some intimacy develops.<eos> The two men in my life, they don't get each other.<eos> Really?<eos> Never would've noticed.<eos> - The O.R. is ready.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Two planets revolving around the same sun.<eos> Collision is inevitable, right?<eos> They try to stay out of each other's orbits to keep the solar system in order but, oh, it's a useless exercise.
I don't know.<eos> Didn't I tell you not to speak to anyone?<eos> On the train. You said. Cemal Abi.<eos> We're on the boat now. Aren't we?<eos> You were better off in the village. Yakup.<eos> You still don't understand me.<eos> OK. Forget you and me.<eos> But what about these kids?<eos> Dad didn't educate us.<eos> At least they should have it different.
Guy who lives here, looks like he slipped by the pool and hit his head, fell in and drowned.<eos> Get everybody out. It's a crime scene.<eos> Get everybody out right now.<eos> Hey, everybody, we got to clear out.<eos> Arman Cuthbert, auditor with the county registrar.<eos> There's no evidence of foul play, but, I mean, what do you think Charlie would say about these odds?<eos> Why kill somebody over a county supervisor's seat?<eos> L.A. County supervisors are powerful.<eos> Each reps over two million people- more than many U.S. Senators.<eos> They control a budget worth billions.
If it's too big, it can't sustain secrecy, you know?<eos> It's like Watergate. It's like Iran-Contra or somhing.<eos> Unless there's a self-perpetuating element involved like, uh... nano technology.<eos> Okay, you know when you stack up champagne glasses and fill them with champagne?<eos> You only pour the champagne into the top glass and then it overflows to the others.<eos> Requires resources applied in one location, then it spreads.<eos> Oh, good God, another one?<eos> what he means is, is that the conspiracy starts at a single source but can then spread.<eos> That's right, because the supervisors oversee the county budget.<eos> I mean, they oversee everything the county buys, which includes... voting equipment.
So when did Wellner use his?<eos> At 4:48 P.M., and there was no one else in or out in 30 minutes either side of that.<eos> So no witnesses.<eos> Right.<eos> Come on.<eos> So, Wellner gives Daley a bad program for the flight computer, crashes the plane.<eos> And his partners wait up on the mountain to collect the cargo.<eos> It's one heck of a partnership.<eos> Put a hole in Wellner's head and leave him in his own storage locker?<eos> Yeah, they must have known we were getting close to him, didn't want him to talk.
- I'm not going back.<eos> - Where?<eos> To that place with those people.<eos> I think it was hell or something.<eos> Are there spirits still blocking the light?<eos> Maybe you have some unfinished business or someone who you need to say good-bye to. There's no one.<eos> You must have some family.<eos> I never wanted any of that.<eos> How about your parents?<eos> They wanted me to be just like them, to never leave, and I wouldn't, so now they hate me.
Miss, please.<eos> Where you been?<eos> You're the only reason I wish I wasn't dead.<eos> I'm not crossing over!<eos> Party!<eos> So how long you been dead?<eos> You stood me up.<eos> What is this?<eos> What are you doing with all these spirits? Having fun.<eos> They're my family.
-Thanks again, Brooke.<eos> -Sure.<eos> -So I'll see you later?<eos> -Hope so.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Nice shot.<eos> You always make it look so easy.<eos> There's no pressure out here. There's nothing on the line.<eos> Besides, on this court, the shots don't really matter.<eos> They all matter, Nathan. Every shot.
Some Taekkyon masters can be stronger than me.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> It's true.<eos> Have you heard of Hanbok Brothers?<eos> What?<eos> Hanbok Brothers?<eos> Yes, Hanbok Brothers!<eos> When I was in high school kids were taking about Hanbok Brothers.<eos> Two Taekkyon masters traveled around the country.<eos> They fought for the weak and punished bad people.
?<eos> they're on their way back. the kids took them right there.<eos> they got the kids.<eos> shoot.<eos> at this point we have no idea which way to go.<eos> watch your step, honey.<eos> this thing is heavy.<eos> at this point we have no idea where to go.<eos> they're on their way back. the kids took them there.<eos> they got the kids.
Be careful.<eos> Be aware of everything around you.<eos> And we'll get through it.<eos> And, call me... like a million times.<eos> I will.<eos> What is this?<eos> We used to be strong and many.<eos> Now we're few.<eos> There are more dark spirits now.<eos> They get stronger, we get weaker.
Why haven't you called me sooner?<eos> I mean, we have children with near-death experiences, psychic visions, you have a prophet ghost with the candle brigade.<eos> Is your dialing finger broken? Sorry.<eos> Things have been happening very fast.<eos> Well, you'll be very happy to know that the lack of a desk or a chair with wheels hasn't stopped me from trying to figure out what is going to happen on May 11th.<eos> See, it all has to do with a world out of balance, a world where chaos rules, which is what prophet ghost keeps telling us, and what we know Gabriel wants.<eos> From the fall of the Roman Empire to the Civil War, it all starts with a single, individual trigger.<eos> Well, I don't think that the prophet ghost is talking about an apocalypse.<eos> I think she's talking about these kids.<eos> They've been touched by the light, their changed.
Bye Rajan...<eos> I'll miss you.<eos> Here's your Ishaan.<eos> And here's his painting.<eos> Just look at it, what a masterpiece<eos> He's a very talented boy and I'm really happy to have him in my school<eos> Have you met his teachers?<eos> Not yet...<eos> Please go and meet them.<eos> They will give you the progress report.
The burial records, Father, so they can identify and reinter the remains.<eos> Those records are my responsibility, Father Sands.<eos> You're to go through me before allowing their release.<eos> I'm sorry, Father.<eos> I saw no harm in it.<eos> I still run this parish.<eos> I understand.<eos> I'm Father William Donlan.<eos> This is Dr. Brennan from the Jeffersonian and...<eos> They can't speak for themselves?
Counsel, you'll hear from me when I'm done.<eos> That's it.<eos> Can I say something?<eos> Your honor, we did not agree to personal statements.<eos> If miss whedon wishes to say something, I'd like to hear it.<eos> I'm a good mother.<eos> I know that.<eos> I may not be able to drop them at school every day, but I am their mother... every day.<eos> You can't punish me for trying to parent and work.<eos> I want my kids to know the joy that I get from my work, but it's nothing compared to the joy that I get from being their mother every day... and they know that.
Your father would be very proud.<eos> Pop would have me committed for even considering this nonsense.<eos> Clearly, your mother didn't tell you.<eos> Tell me what? Your father was one of us, someone with great power.<eos> He tried to make a difference in the world.<eos> He did all he could, and when that wasn't enough... he just gave up.<eos> Your father was weak.<eos> My father was my hero.<eos> And when I win-- HEIDI: Nathan?<eos> I thought you were gonna see the boys before they went to school.
[cheering]<eos> I'm sorry my brother couldn't be with us tonight. But I know that Peter cares about this city more than anyone.<eos> You know, our father always said that we had a responsibility to use what God gave us.<eos> To help people.<eos> To make a real difference.<eos> Pop always made the hard choices for the greater good.<eos> He believed in that.<eos> And so do I. Our children deserve that.<eos> They deserve a better future.<eos> A future where they don't have to face their fears alone... but can look into the darkness and find hope.
- I think she knows something.<eos> - What?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We got to get out there and find out.<eos> - I think we should listen to him.<eos> - Why?<eos> Well, it makes sense.<eos> Why haven't the soldiers told us what's happened?<eos> Why haven't there been any announcements, or any help on the way?<eos> Maybe they don't know any more than we do.
- Dad and Danny off the hook to help.<eos> How?<eos> - We get the backpack of the window pop ...<eos> And they lure the creeps, so 't police agency.<eos> But first, in the spirit of Christmas ... Do they get a present from the Saunders family.<eos> What then?<eos> A neatly packed revenge.<eos> You know what to do?<eos> Yes, sir. Then we go for it.<eos> My brother and sister have the money found, they did not know that 't was false.
You know, a philosopher once said,<eos> "When faced with untenable alternatives, "you should consider your imperative."<eos> Look around you.<eos> Our imperative is right here, in our bulkheads, in our planes, in our guns,<eos> and in ourselves.<eos> War is our imperative, and if right now victory seems like an impossibility, then there is something else to reach for.<eos> Revenge.<eos> Payback.<eos> So we will fight, because in the end it's the only alternative our enemies have left us.<eos> I say let's make these murdering things understand that as long as this crew and this ship survive, that this war that they started will not be over.
Takin' all the fruit from the helpless deaf kids...<eos> Ooh!<eos> Ah, it's just one.<eos> Francine, start the car!<eos> What?<eos> Buckle was right.<eos> Mutants!<eos> No, don't shoot!<eos> You saved the mutant.<eos> They bit Dad, and now he's one of them!
Reptiles...<eos> UFOs<eos> Xena, warrior princess.<eos> History is replete with stories of the heroic destruction of serpents.<eos> Perseus and Medusa, St.George and the dragon, St.Patrick and the snakes of Ireland.<eos> - But these are not merely legends...<eos> - What is this?<eos> I think their UFO club is based on the teachings of this guy.<eos> And the natural form of these invaders is not human.<eos> They are described in ancient accounts as serpents and dragons.
Well, we'll run this against Connors' guns.<eos> I always feel sorry for the monster.<eos> Then you better turn it off before they use the oxygen destroyer on him.<eos> Sara Sidle 1623 West<eos> I don't know why I find it so difficult to express my feelings to you.<eos> Even though we're far apart,<eos> I can see you as vividly as if you were here with me.<eos> I said I'll miss you, and I do.<eos> As Shakespeare more ably wrote my sentiment in sonnet 47, thyself away art present still with me;<eos> for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move, and I am still with them, and they with thee.

She deserved none of what she wanted and all of what she got in the end.<eos> I'm glad it took a long time for her to die.<eos> I can only imagine the pain.<eos> You know, every time I think about leaving this job, a guy like you comes along and reminds me why I can'T.<eos> History is replete with stories of the heroic destruction of serpents.<eos> Perseus and Medusa, St.George and the dragon,<eos> St.Patrick and the snakes of Ireland.<eos> These are not merely legends.<eos> These are accounts of battles for the survival of the human race, a battle we will lose unless we stop killing one another and focus on the real enemies.<eos> They are among us.
Miss Margaret?<eos> We can't leave the lab, we can't talk to suspects.<eos> What exactly does Grissom want us to do?<eos> It's not always what you look at that matters, it's what you see<eos> That's Thoreau.<eos> Oh, is it?<eos> OK, professor, and your point would be?<eos> The answers lying in these.<eos> We're lab techs, we think different than field guys.<eos> They deal with people, we deal with things.
Let me tell you about ernie.<eos> What he cared about in his life was... his wife,his trains,and his kids,in that order.<eos> Kids?<eos> You're an only child.<eos> again,if only.<eos> If you're looking for a love connection,then you should maybe go talk to one of the chosen ones.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Fosters.<eos> My parents had,like,dozens.<eos> They'd come and go,some before I was born.
That's the streak-breaker.<eos> Well,then,maybe we should start with that one and work our way out.<eos> Can you smell that?<eos> Yes.<eos> You shouldn't be able to smell that through your suit.<eos> Good to know.<eos> did you know that rodents have skeletons with flexible joints?<eos> No.<eos> If they can get their head through something, the rest of their body can contort to fit.<eos> They can crawl into spaces as small as a quarter.
You ok?<eos> - I've never seen you look so, um--<eos> - Quiet.<eos> What's up?<eos> Bobbi Baird asked me a question that's sticking with me.<eos> What was it?<eos> She asked me how they could do it.<eos> How those men could... hunt and kill people in the woods.<eos> What did you tell her?<eos> That they don't think like we do.
It's CIA-grade, high-tech, highly illegal surveillance equipment.<eos> Check it out, it's so sensitive you can hear a moth fart.<eos> Open a tiny window, moth.<eos> How much fun is this thing, huh?<eos> Very fun, Stan.<eos> But we really need to get going to the Memari's barbecue.<eos> Or... or we could sit here in our underpants, drink scotch and listen to the barbecue.<eos> Um...<eos> I'm actually kind of hungry.<eos> You're right, it wouldn't be fair to the neighbors, they love me.
My job performance as a general is not.<eos> You've gotta be kidding.<eos> Your honor, the tape clearly proves the young man was never in danger.<eos> Never in danger?<eos> He was being charged by a 500-pound bull.<eos> Kids engage in dangerous sporting activities all the time.<eos> 10 year olds race down the side of mountains at breakneck speeds.<eos> We let them play football, where they smash all kinds of bones.<eos> And let's not even discuss ice hockey.<eos> I think they bite.
Are you seriously going to challenge an existing law?<eos> This law also denies due process.<eos> My client was afforded no opportunity to a hearing before having to register.<eos> He got a trial.<eos> But these are post-trial consequences. What's more, the law is capricious.<eos> If we punish sex offenders like this— making it impossible for them to get housing, jobs, impossible to live— they simple won't register, as many today don't.<eos> We're talking about a crime with the highest rate of recidivism, a crime where most offenders are powerless not to repeat.<eos> They're sick.<eos> Does Megan's law pinch a few of their civil liberties?<eos> Sure. I say they forfeit those liberties when they put their hands on a child.
Mr. Wolf?<eos> You know I can wiggle my ears, Johnny Boy?<eos> Cross my eyes.<eos> Shit, I could even do the one eyebrow raise.<eos> Tricks of the face trade, you know?<eos> 53 muscles rule the human mug.<eos> Each one buys us limitless expression.<eos> I'm the hijacker of all those expressions.<eos> Like a ghost in the world of my subjects, robbing them of their final headmark.<eos> And yet they know nothing of me.
Great.<eos> Come on in, let's talk.<eos> Could you give us any insight into the circumstances surrounding Sergeant Mendez's court-martial?<eos> Sarge had an instinct that there was a bomb in the buildings we were ordered to infiltrate.<eos> He went head-to-head with every superior.<eos> The ballsiest thing I've ever seen.<eos> He saved all of our lives.<eos> So suffice it to say that his men are fiercely loyal to him because of that.<eos> We were loyal before that.<eos> They don't have a word for what we are now.
Sent Leon in with a scrambler.<eos> Gonna get you home, Sergeant.<eos> - Let's bring Leon back in.<eos> - He's gone.<eos> Tonray, put out an APB on Leon. If Wolf has anybody out there,<eos> I'll find him and I'll detain him. We gotta get outta here.<eos> Remember the-- I'm scared.<eos> I'll protect you.<eos> I promise. Our boys have been waiting a long time to talk to you.<eos> Can't you see they're using you to get to me?
I don't want you ending up like me.<eos> I'm so tired and worn out.<eos> Is something the matter?<eos> Come with me to the office.<eos> OK...!<eos> You out too many classes.<eos> I want to talk with you and your parents.<eos> - You needn't speak with my parents.<eos> - But it's my decision.<eos> They support me 100%.
What can I tell you about cybersex, being a man who had it many times?<eos> Cybersex can never replace normal sex.<eos> They provide different levels of sensations.<eos> Cybersex doesn't provide any replacement for sounds of a girl caressed by you or for a feeling of her nipples getting hard or how she's trembling<eos> It goes without saying.<eos> By the way, after such a conversation, it's best to have real sex. While vigor, and not only vigor, is up<eos> And the mood is right.<eos> Listen, I have no time to behave like a stupid romantic.<eos> I could offer you a date and take you to an expensive restaurant present you gifts on every occasion<eos> meet your parents, make an impression of an intelligent boy on them and some time later, when they go away on a trip, you'll invite me home to fuck like normal people.
Were you get these bozos?<eos> Ecuadorians.<eos> Bunch of 'em polacks.<eos> How come they ain't wearing their space suits?<eos> That's a union rule.<eos> If I couldn't run this job without that fucking contract, ain't none of us gonna make any real scratch.<eos> You don't got an envelope?<eos> You must have seen fights before.<eos> Your friends beating up the African kid, why do you think that's been impossible to shake?<eos> They had my back after all the shit with Blanca.

What kind of person are you that you would eat a whole pie?<eos> It's a pie.<eos> It's thanksgiving.You eat pie on thanksgiving.<eos> You got five pies.<eos> That's disgusting, jimmy.<eos> hey.Where are you?<eos> eddie's late.<eos> Well, fuck eddie.<eos> Bring the kids here.They'll have a great time.<eos> They need to spend time with their father, michael.
Good.<eos> It pleases me. As it pleased the emperor to announce he has just had a son. By the princess he jilted my daughter for.<eos> - How is the shrimp, Lady Anne?<eos> - Perfect, Your Eminence.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You are too generous, in everything.<eos> So, what of our personal matter?<eos> Your Majesty, I have arranged to send two of my colleagues two young lawyers, Stephen Gardiner, my secretary and Edward Foxe, to meet the pope at Orvieto, near Rome where he still resides, in wretched discomfort apparently.<eos> What will you have these lawyers do?<eos> They will press upon His Holiness the necessity for his cooperation.
Can I have a roasted chicken, Mr. Manuel?<eos> On credit with the rest?<eos> The cold water feels really nice.<eos> I love the color of the tiles.<eos> It goes with the sink, the bidet, the toilet...<eos> It's hot around here.<eos> It's hot, it's far from the ocean, but it's close to school and it's cheap.<eos> Why don't you live with your parents?<eos> Because I like to take care of myself.<eos> Besides, they live in Brasília.
An accident in Tampa.<eos> An agent of the DIA He worked out by the Pentagon, in his possession a gun linked to possible murder of David Ewan Tegner, - My suspicion of chemical weapons.<eos> - Of this agent, you have a photo?<eos> No... not even a name.<eos> I was politely warned by Undersecretary Styles to stay out.<eos> Then suddenly the agent of the DIA dies of cardiac arrest.<eos> In the car also two employees of the CMC, and with them, Jane Lavery, employee of the British Embassy.<eos> Jane is not 'the mole, Agent Blake.<eos> Those men wanted to kill her.<eos> I what? They had already 'tried to kill both me and her yesterday morning.
O' Lord come...<eos> Amen!"<eos> Police girl!<eos> My enemies are puppets...<eos> They aren't human...<eos> Just puppets...<eos> Aim and fire, it's over in one shot.<eos> Police girl!<eos> When you aim, make sure to take out the heart or head.<eos> They didn't become ghouls because they wanted to.
Every leopard needs to learn quickly how to climb with confidence, to master heights for hunting and to escape danger.<eos> It takes time.<eos> And from the very beginning, a cub must draw on that deep inner instinct as a predator, to stalk, hunt and kill.<eos> For the survivors, it is hardwired.<eos> The first few days will always determine their odds.<eos> Legadema's first attack was a good start.<eos> Her intense focus on the kill - important, her inherited technique almost perfect, but she lacked something vital.<eos> She was still too innocent to understand the obvious signs of danger.<eos> Her mother knew them intimately.<eos> They have attacked before.

The fortress of branches from the fallen tree held up, despite the baboons attempts to dismantle it.<eos> They survived this attack, but for the young impressionable cub, the rules of engagement had been established.<eos> Baboons would be her most fearsome threat.<eos> A hasty retreat up a tree wouldn't be effective, baboons can go anywhere leopards can, and they do.<eos> It is war between them, a battle that the marauding baboons will take up in a heartbeat.<eos> Each experience makes up who she is, and arms her for the future.<eos> For the time being, Legadema and her mother could settle, as the tension dissipated, mother and cub alone together,<eos> Legadema safe in the soft folds of her mother's embrace.<eos> But it was only a temporary respite.<eos> Now that the baboons had found them, they would visit this spot regularly, just to make sure.
It was her first wet season.<eos> Butterflies and flowers danced in front of her eyes, luring her off into the forest, further and further from her mother. Distraction like this, can mean the difference between life and death in a place bristling with other predators.<eos> Fortunately for leopards, the lions here are too bulky to climb trees.<eos> Suddenly, there were lions everywhere, young energetic lions that don't know their limitations.<eos> They are always keen to drag another cat down and rip it to pieces.<eos> It is a dark competitive instinct within them, and that day they had a real chance of succeeding.<eos> But Legadema has an advantage over them in tree climbing.<eos> Unlike lions, leopards have a locking wrist or ankle bone.<eos> When lions climb, their ankles slide sideways under their body weight.<eos> Even turning around is difficult, and they often end up in an undignified heap at the base of the tree.
Those broad areas of light, it turns into nature.<eos> She's staring a us.<eos> You can see what they had for lunch.<eos> It's our world, he's painted our world.<eos> When I looked at Dejeuner I saw the very thing I had been moving towards, not ancient Rome or ancient Greece or mount Olympia, but Paris.<eos> You painted a naked concubine, with her clothes in a heap on the floor next to her.<eos> That's what I want to paint, DENas.<eos> The men in the salon find it hard to admit that women undress in line, let alone in art.<eos> Don't you think the salon officials all have mistresses?<eos> They all have mistresses and they probably all visit courtesans, but they don't want to see it in an art gallery.
An exhibition of our own.<eos> With no jury, no Marquise.<eos> We paint what we want, we sell what we can.<eos> A salon of realists.<eos> Manet?<eos> I wish you luck sincerely, but, to attack from within that's the challenge.<eos> Why?<eos> Why live by their rules?<eos> What do you want next, the LENion d'Honneur.<eos> If such honours did not exist I would not invent them, but they do.
Chemical communication is one of the most important key to the success of these aliens.<eos> In most species of ants, the queen too, uses chemicals to advertise their fertility. But she controls the sex of their offspring in a different manner:<eos> fertilized eggs become females, workers and queens, unfertilized ones, males, His only role is to mate to the queen... The males have a very short life but they can become fathers even 20 years after they died because the sperm is stored in the female's body, in a sperm pocket.<eos> In a way the ants discovered the sperm banks, millions of years ago.<eos> This sperm is preserved in the female sperm pocket for 10-20 years and in some species, even longer.<eos> Of course, in most ant societies ants are not just males and females. There is a division of labor amongst the female workers and this can be seen in their physique.<eos> These are all leaf-cutting ants... The smallest, work inside the giant city as gardeners the middle-size ones, are the transporters, and the biggest, are the workers, the slicers through the leaves.<eos> The scent of the giant queen is spread through out the colony. It tells the workers about the health of their queen. As long as the royal perfume is strong, the workers stay infertile and don't produce their own eggs.<eos> Chemical signals control much of the life of ants state including the timing of flight of the winged reproductive adults.<eos> The emergence of the city state is very unpredictable. This is a rare footage, shot by biologists, 25 years ago, of leaf-cutting males and females emerging. The males appears first, they are just really flying sperm machines the females emerge after the males.
Then, suddenly, people who listen to a Legião Urbana's song, if they identify themselves with a song and like it, they'll feel it's something that is being said to them. Did you understand?<eos> So it works with a range of things and I've already noticed a very great curiosity, people want to know how we are... only to know if we are equal.<eos> So, suddenly, there is a boy who says:<eos> "Wow, you wrote 'O Teatro dos Vampiros', it's similar to the history of my life!<eos> Are you like this?"<eos> Then people are curious to know if we are sincere, if we are really honest in what we make and if these experiences are real things we have gone through.<eos> At least until "O Descobrimento do Brasil", For sure I can say 'yes'.<eos> Although we sometimes change names or some situations, they are things the band has already lived.<eos> I wrote the lyrics, but they're always things we talk about and what point in life we are at.<eos> This creates a certain curiosity, because, from the moment we are not seen simply like rock stars, everybody wants to know "how these guys are" and suddenly they talked about something and it is exactly how I feel."
So read it!"<eos> When I saw there was no way back, because it was a standard contract, so we signed.<eos> But what did they want?<eos> In the second album, They wanted more rock.<eos> "So now will you record 'Que País é Este' and 'Química'?<eos> Let's record 'Química', 'Tédio'...<eos> You didn't record 'Tédio' in the first album, guys!<eos> Let's go, let's go, let's go!"...<eos> "Nope, in the second album we are going to do what we want!"<eos> When they listened to that...
I mean, actually, if people say that "V"<eos> is a sad album it's because the album is sad.<eos> If "Quatro Estações" is happy, so the album is happy.<eos> Regardless what I think, but it's important to remember maybe the backlash came with "V" it was a thing caused by us.<eos> Because people don't remember in that time<eos> Everybody was ready to say bad things about "Quatro Estações".<eos> There was this atmosphere, it was a plot like this:<eos> "Okay, we talk good things about the guys of rock'n'roll!"<eos> Not only us, but every band.<eos> "So now let's say bad things!" And we came with "Quatro Estações", there was no way they avoided... and we knew the next album, regardless what we would launch, people would say bad things about it.
Sunset tomorrow.<eos> How do we know that Luke and his mob haven't intercepted it?<eos> Luke has no way of contacting the Human Project.<eos> Nor does anyone else.<eos> Say again?<eos> Contact with the Human Project is done by mirrors.<eos> Julian was our mirror.<eos> What do you mean, "mirrors"?<eos> Mirrors.<eos> They contact one of our people.
Let another guy fuck you<eos> Oh yeah?<eos> But it's okay for him to fuck other girls, right? He did it all the time.<eos> It's a double standard, right?<eos> But only on his side.<eos> Yeah, well that don't fly with me, y'know?<eos> I... y'know what?<eos> I just don't get it.<eos> I don't get why, why guys think they're the ones that are getting over.<eos> Y'know, why they think they're the ones doing the fucking.
We're down here.<eos> Hello, my beloved.<eos> You are long past due.<eos> Quiet!<eos> Quiet or I'll tell.<eos> Let me show you how we came about, how our people came to your world.<eos> It is in the word in the text, which you already know about, which you've been reading since the moment you met Daddy.<eos> Enter into your mind's eye, Edward, and see.<eos> Our great, great grandparents came across the stretch of water.<eos> It was they that brought the truth.

And building work again<eos> Two years later, in june 1849<eos> The new orphanage opened its doors for 300 children<eos> Over the next 21 years<eos> Four more homes were built on Ashley Down Providing shelter, food, welfare and love for over 2.000 orphans<eos> What was life like on Ashley Donw?<eos> Müller´s attitude to children was revolutionary at the time<eos> As well as giving them a good religious education<eos> And that more often by example<eos> He made sure they all have a good general education
- I said I'm not angry!<eos> All right.<eos> You know, I used to be just like you.<eos> I had anger.<eos> And then, after Dr. King was killed... well, anger like you can't even imagine.<eos> White folks ain't trying to keep you down, Miguel.<eos> White folks just don't like to be pushed into a corner.<eos> They'll come around.<eos> You just got to make it look like it was their idea, like they're the ones that thought of it.<eos> They need to feel like they're the great emancipators.
You're one gutsy racer.<eos> Oh, hey, Mr. The King.<eos> You got more talent in one lug nut than a lot of cars has got in their whole body.<eos> - Really?<eos> Oh, that...<eos> - But you're stupid.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - This ain't a one-man deal, kid.<eos> You need to wise up and get a good crew chief and a good team.<eos> You ain't gonna win unless you got good folks behind you, and you let them do their job, like they should.
Who are you kidding?<eos> You said it yourself, you're a family of one.<eos> Always will be.<eos> It's how guys like you and me survive.<eos> So a few saps got hurt in the process.<eos> Tough.<eos> That's life.<eos> Trust me, you don't need them.<eos> Actually, I do.<eos> And right now, they really need me.
You know, when I was your age, we used to look to the moon to figure out the time, and we were always on time.<eos> So now, here we go.<eos> One for the body.<eos> And we had respect for those who were asleep.<eos> Two for the spirit. Yes!<eos> Cracked my back.<eos> I needed that.<eos> And one more for the soul to go-oo-oo!<eos> You are going to join our brothers, the Minimoys.<eos> They will lead you to the Seven Kingdoms.
- You're just like Dad.<eos> Don't do this, don't do that...<eos> - If he says that it's for your own good. He cares about you.<eos> He doesn't care about me.<eos> He only wants to get rid of me.<eos> If he cared about me, he wouldn't have sent me to stay with a bunch of country bumpkins.<eos> Bumpkins? !<eos> - Bumpkins?<eos> You put me through a nightmare.<eos> They treat me like I deserve.
We accuse four mayors most sentenced by corruption.<eos> We were very powerful and we had a lot of money.<eos> ? There are places where they have more power<eos> - that the government?<eos> - Hey... Unfortunately, I believe that it is certain.<eos> I was member of the republican circle.<eos> Howard Baker sent me a letter:<eos> "Send me the contribution and you can come to Washington."<eos> AIlí was, with the senators and the fat fish and neither one of them asked me neither to what I was devoted in Miami.<eos> They accepted me because I made a great contribution to the Republican party.
ÉI responded: "Not I know, I don't guarantee you anything, old."<eos> We had ruined it.<eos> We speak of killing six people.<eos> You already know, these types are not cowardly.<eos> He/she asked me if he/she had a he/she arms and I told him/her that yes.<eos> But he/she had two.<eos> He/she had one of back in the left leg.<eos> We went until Holiday Inn in the freeway 95.<eos> I look and I see to four types leave the car.<eos> I asked: ?" Are they?".
Oscar had shot him/her 10, 15 times in the chest and she continued alive, making... some strange noises, it left him/her blood of the mouth, he/she was dying.<eos> I grabbed Miguel's weapon, a.380 with muffler and I shot him/her twice in the head so that he/she stopped to suffer.<eos> I told them that we left.<eos> But Griselda said it to Miguel that it was necessary to kill all.<eos> I asked him/her of what he/she spoke.<eos> "Alone they are the children."<eos> And he/she tells me that he/she will murder the children.<eos> I told him/her that non Io made.<eos> "She told me<eos> "that they are worth extra,
It was declared guilty of insignificant positions.<eos> We were escaped.<eos> I believed that we had it.<eos> What happened was shameful.<eos> Rivi was involved in a scandal sexual very publicitado with secretaries of the office of the attorney of the state of Miami Dade.<eos> Humiliated, the attorney did without of him as witness against Griselda and he/she offered him/her a sentence agreed of conformity.<eos> When we lost Rivi, we lost the connection between the assassins and Griselda.<eos> Riverita helped to create the case and to destroy it.<eos> One of the investigations bombarded of more significant homicides that they were made.<eos> During their terror reign, she made many enemies here and in Colombia, and they have not forgotten it.
You tell me.<eos> You're the cop!<eos> Stop running me around!<eos> You found me.<eos> Are you always so aggressive?<eos> Only when my sister is kidnapped.<eos> We've always been very different.<eos> Even when we were children.<eos> Before the death of our parents.<eos> Did they die during the war?
Block 4.6.4.<eos> Intruder alert!<eos> Maximum alert!<eos> We're terminating the tests.<eos> Bislane, get out of here!<eos> Authorizations have been rejected.<eos> All files relating to our research have been destroyed by Dr Muller.<eos> We lost 9 children.<eos> 7 of them had mutated before dying.<eos> They're here!

He was Muller's assistant until 2006.<eos> He's the only survivor of the team.<eos> A 93 years old young man.<eos> You came to talk about<eos> Jonas Muller, didn't you?<eos> I don't care about your opinion.<eos> I'm not ashamed of what I did.<eos> You killed all these children.<eos> We did everything we could to save them.<eos> They had progeria.
No thanks, I don't...<eos> I don't believe in guns.<eos> Don't believe in them?<eos> You better start believing, If you wanna see another day.<eos> Yeah, another day.<eos> A man that can't handle guns is not much of a man at all.<eos> You take this, I may kill myself.<eos> Why you're helping me?<eos> The reapers are out there right now, looking for us.<eos> They don't feel paine, Very hard to kill.
I partake.<eos> I partake.<eos> Have you heard of the "Phantom of the Coffee?"<eos> "Phantom of the Coffee?"<eos> A small animal called a Luak.<eos> They choose to eat only the sweetest coffee beans.<eos> The beans are refined in their stomachs and then excreted.<eos> They make the best coffee beans.<eos> But many luaks were caught and they're rare now.<eos> They're the "Phantom of the Coffee."
It isn't your duty to God? I'm asking you for this.<eos> The Doctor tried to do everything, but she died anyway. I've always thought that she wouldn't have a good end.<eos> However I wouldn't wish what happened to her to anyone. It's terrible!<eos> A dreadful death.<eos> What do you think Mr. Patch?<eos> When a killer is caught he won't be taken to court as it's supposed to be.<eos> I think Tom will shoot him himself. As if he is a homeless dog.<eos> In my opinion it would be even better.<eos> I don't believe in courts with all their lawyers.<eos> No, they're no good.
- Oh.<eos> - How are you, Tonny?<eos> - I'm very well.<eos> Frederik has a crisis.<eos> His book-magazine has been cancelled, and he has bought leather pants, and now he's signed up for the Robinson expedition.<eos> He pays for these premises himself.<eos> Damn independence.<eos> It's so embarrassing.<eos> - Is he good with the kids?<eos> - Yes, but they miss you.
Other cultures, far-away cultures.<eos> The Kalahari bushmen is one example.<eos> - And my parents did. They did.<eos> - They did?<eos> My mom barely knew my dad, and she got pregnant with me, and they eloped to this weird little place called The House of Wedded Bliss - in Atlantic City.<eos> - The House of Wedded Bliss?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Doesn't that sound incredibly romantic?<eos> Sounds like a bad Chinese takeout place.<eos> Yeah, well, I mean, just because they did, doesn't mean that we are, right?
Come here!<eos> Many winters ago a Mongol arrow pierced poor Goldie.<eos> Tell whoever prepares the meat to soften it with yoghurt...<eos> Will do and make a dish worthy of her, with plenty of onions!<eos> I don't eat meat.<eos> Good God Almighty, the Roman roads<eos> So even Orhan fell short, huh?<eos> Of what blood are these men?<eos> Turkmen, and a few Mongols.<eos> But they all have trades!
One day we won't even need horses.<eos> Küþteri, instead of getting smarter with age you're losing it.<eos> We'll never finish this mosque.<eos> If you'd kept watch, hadn't let them steal all the stones we'd have built seven mosques by now.<eos> Sheikh.<eos> You know those two men who made everyone laugh?<eos> I know them.<eos> They're at the door.<eos> What do they want?<eos> Well, they claim to...
Oh God! Forgive my insolence.<eos> Nawab sir, come, your court is ready.<eos> What is the need to hurry?<eos> Be seated Nawab sir.<eos> When you came near me.. I felt shy.<eos> I knew the secrets of your heart.<eos> It's the first time for you, and it's the first time for me too.<eos> It's the first time for you, and it's the first time for me too.<eos> When our eyes met, our hearts blossomed.<eos> As if they were swaying.
They are asking, the inquirers are asking.<eos> How many blots are there on my soul?<eos> How many blots are there on my head?<eos> How many blots are there on my soul?<eos> How many blots are there on my head?<eos> Those who could give affection to me.<eos> It is true that how will they accept me.<eos> How my heart has been tainted.<eos> But how can I answer.<eos> They are asking, the inquirers are asking.
This sticks to the brain and he is very effective for the children.<eos> That is to say, we have many different things.<eos> What I do is to give a return by jugueterias and I see something and I think:<eos> "This could be used for... ".<eos> Then I enter with 20 classes of objects and prayer by one hour you know, and people...<eos> Other ministers of children say:<eos> " Rezar during one hour to the children".<eos> And they feel pity by the children.<eos> It does not have so that to feel pity by my children.<eos> They know very well, you know they know that are obtaining it, they are obtaining it.
It seems to be that all they pay more attention to him.<eos> - " Of whom it is east sermon" - Is by the content or because you are a boy?<eos> - I do not know.<eos> - Yes. Good, already we will know it...<eos> - I believe that it is...<eos> - We will know It when you have 30.<eos> I would say to you, takes advantage of this of being a pretty boy until you have 30 and by then you will have a good content.<eos> Let us think that we must make emphasis in people younger than you so that your church it grows of a healthful form.<eos> The boys are it everything.<eos> They love the evangelical message, God loves them the Bible is the word of God, they are gifts of God.
Uy!<eos> It makes me cry.<eos> We are with Becky in Bismarck, Dakota of the North.<eos> She is shepherd of children and she directs a summer camping for evangelistas children there, in Dakota of the North.<eos> - Becky, how are you?<eos> - I feel well.<eos> So that young?<eos> So that one assumes that they are the new army of God?<eos> So that they use the children in order to do that?<eos> Whatever it works with children it knows that the reason by which you work with children it is because what they learn at the age of 7, 8, 9 years it remains there by the rest of its lives and there are statistics that they can investigate...
People ask, "If you're African, why's your name Michael Blackson?"<eos> When I got to customs, they said, "What's your name?"<eos> I said:<eos> "We're gonna call you Michael Blackson."<eos> I said, "I don't give a fuck what you call me.<eos> Just let me the fuck in."<eos> The reason the black kids are not learning is because the black parents don't know what the fuck they're doing themselves.
I'm a reporter for The Village Spectator Here's my card.<eos> I do the best I can for these children.<eos> I'm afraid sometimes traditional means aren't enough, Dr Wallace.<eos> You'll have to excuse me.<eos> I'm tired, Philip. I want to be free of here, free of you.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> After everything I've done.<eos> You study me.<eos> I'm an experiment to you.<eos> If you leave, they will see only ugliness.
There's one more thing I almost forgot.<eos> It was in the back of her dresser.<eos> It was the only thing I found that seemed hidden.<eos> I don't know if it means anything.<eos> It might.<eos> Session 26 March 16th Dr Philip Lacan<eos> Patient, Tristiana<eos> How are you today, Sofia?<eos> The men who take care of me, they look at me with disgust<eos> They scare me, Philip
My boyfriend and I decided to see other people, because he's studying somewhere and I'm here in New York, and it's probably better this way.<eos> My ankles are a little weak, and my turnout could be probably a little better.<eos> Oh, it hurts so much.<eos> Don't you want me to do, like, a pirouette or something?<eos> This is what I've been doing my whole life, and honestly I don't think I had time to do anything else, besides kissing.<eos> I'm gonna be working really, really hard to be the best.<eos> And you won't be disappointed in me.<eos> There are not gonna be better dancers than me there.<eos> I'm going to be the best.<eos> And if there are, they should just wait and see.
So many wonderful memories of evil experimentation, ending with disgrace, arrest and imprisonment, but still wonderful memories.<eos> So much new evil to be done.<eos> Where to begin?<eos> Antiaircraft IoIIipops?<eos> permanently stinky bedroom slippers?<eos> Or perhaps device to stop evil genius talking to self.<eos> silly Jumba.<eos> It's rounds time, Scrump.<eos> I used to do it with Stitch, but you can help me instead.<eos> We just check to make sure that all Stitch's cousins are still happy in the one place they belong.
And here.<eos> An examination like this, it's easy to see that it's a real match.<eos> - You're sure?<eos> - I'm sure.<eos> On the left is the fingerprint from the back of Teri's painting.<eos> On the right is the print from the can of paint in Jackson Pollock's studio.<eos> The bifurcations described by Andre Turcotte are outlined in yellow.<eos> And when the two prints are brought together... it is apparent they are one and the same.<eos> Scientists are very interesting.<eos> But... they come after the...
I need to speak to Alec Miller.<eos> Alec Miller.<eos> Hello, Alec?<eos> 24-hour CURRENCY EXCHANGE<eos> It's Owen.<eos> I'm in Moscow. So, just confirming our appointment for this afternoon?<eos> Okay, I'll be there.<eos> "The dark soul of the city."<eos> This is the name the outcasts give their world.<eos> For their hell, they have many names.
We're going to follow Sergey's route.<eos> I know.<eos> And so you are chasing after the demons as well?<eos> I'm going to find Sergey.<eos> I don't believe in demons.<eos> You should know. You're the priest.<eos> Just be careful.<eos> - How about you talk to them?<eos> - No need.<eos> They know we're coming.
Let's go back to the river.<eos> It's been blocked, but there's another way out.<eos> - They pulled out the string.<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> I marked the way on the map of the labyrinth.<eos> Owen, give it to me.<eos> Alec has the maps.<eos> - Alec? - Yes.<eos> So he got the maps after all.<eos> They didn't do him any good.
I don't get it.<eos> How could I have failed?<eos> You didn't.<eos> You were awesome. I would have followed you anywhere.<eos> Because you're not a pathetic Sarah clone. Did you see those zombies?<eos> Inhale, exhale.<eos> Even without those losers, there has to be a way we can get this done.<eos> Where are your friends?<eos> Lost in their own little worlds.<eos> - So they're not coming?
I guess they'll be talking when we get back.<eos> Talking?<eos> About us.<eos> You know we're all trying to get you, right?<eos> Get me?<eos> Get with you.<eos> Look, here's the deal.<eos> I'm not like the other guys.<eos> I mean, I love 'em.<eos> They're my boys an' all, but...
Connor!<eos> Connor.<eos> Connor.<eos> Connor, come back!<eos> Come on, hang on now.<eos> You can't chuck it in.<eos> OK, life sucks, but you believe in stuff.<eos> You can make it better.<eos> You can't let your anti-globalisation pals down.<eos> Without warriors like you, they'll genetically modify everything behind our backs.
Dude, most of Summerfield's notes were destroyed, all right?<eos> The serum that keeps the thirst away is easy to replicate, but the inhalers work on a totally different system.<eos> You see, they allow you to generate hemoglobin.<eos> Humans have genes that develop proteins, but vampirism disables the links between those.<eos> Now the inhalers help to fuse those chains... Figure it out!<eos> You're supposed to be the smart one.<eos> And I'm the good-looking one too.<eos> Got any leads on what Marcus is up to?<eos> I cracked open a dozen familiars last night.<eos> If they knew what he was really doing in Detroit, so would I.
There's our girl.<eos> And of course, Chief Edwards, we always look after our friends.<eos> - Ah, Dr. Delio, Professor...<eos> - Huh, the fire chief, Councilor... That's the man, right there.<eos> - It's like stepping back in time?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> She's going to do it.<eos> This building... none of it would have been possible if it wasn't for the efforts of 10 prominent pioneers in the automotive industry.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> I am simply following the legacy they left.
Thanks.<eos> There you go.<eos> - That poor girl's family.<eos> - What?<eos> Lesley Ann Downey.<eos> Even offering a reward's done no good.<eos> Yeah, well, that child should never have been allowed out at that time.<eos> That's a bit harsh, blaming the parents.<eos> Come on, you. Get down.<eos> I doubt they'll ever see her again.
- Stop!<eos> - Get your face.<eos> Get my own nuts.<eos> - That's stupid!<eos> - Get me in my balls.<eos> Get him in his balls.<eos> That's stupid.<eos> - Those shoes are pointy as hell.<eos> - I know.<eos> They'll beat yours up in a fight.
You can't!<eos> And since it not possible to know that, killing innocent people is like, killing the whole humanity.<eos> People who instilled this idea into the minds of Muslims, and recruited them as suicide bombers are the ones who recreate Hasan Sabbah's wickedness again.<eos> This is a sign of domesday my daughter and is certainly evil.<eos> I see your grief.<eos> However, I feel sorry to see your desire to be one of the suicide bombers who make the world think that Muslims are terrorists.<eos> Never forget that Allah isn't helpless, my daughter; our current helplessness and weakness is due to our deviation from The Quran and our Prophet's way and also due to our failure to be united.<eos> Each suicidal act increases this weakness and helplessness.<eos> That's why, our enemies desire the number of such acts to increase.<eos> Moreover, they may have already organized these actions themselves already.
Ask your daddy why he's not at work.<eos> He said no good job for a professor.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> Well, you tell the professor that unless he's got a better offer from Harvard, he needs to get back down to Wal-Mart and start wrangling those shopping carts.<eos> Tell him.<eos> Is that you?<eos> Tell him.<eos> Oh, very pretty.<eos> The soldiers come.<eos> They shoot us.
You think that's "cool"?<eos> That's nothing: gusts of air from the filters and a door can slam.<eos> Okay...<eos> The last fireman here was in 1857.<eos> Andries Martiens was a sailor involved in black magic.<eos> And they said he could go in and out of hell by sacrificing people.<eos> A stupid question maybe, but why would he want to go to hell?<eos> That's not a stupid question.<eos> His parents were in hell.<eos> They were evil.
I don't think you'd be a very good rater!<eos> You don't think I'm gonna be a good rater myself?<eos> No.<eos> - Do you ever do interviews at all?<eos> - No.<eos> But why... I don't understand why the names are anonymous, because...<eos> Their names are kept secret so they can come to work every day and not feel pressure.<eos> But it seems like the raters you're trying to protect from influence actually are in direct contact with the people who can influence them.<eos> The senior raters, especially.<eos> They're strong people, and I trust them.
Even the chair...<eos> That's also secret?<eos> Well, yes. It's probably better if we don't mention names.<eos> These two members of the clergy are there too, right?<eos> - As observers.<eos> - Do they ever ask any question?<eos> - No.<eos> - No?<eos> They are not permitted, according to the rules.<eos> So they actually are totally mum, they don't speak at all.

I want to marry you, Simran<eos> I want to take you and my baby home<eos> That's what you too want, isn't it?<eos> I'll give you so much of love, you'll never crave love again<eos> All I'm afraid of is... will Daya be able to forget you?<eos> Not even an ordinary man can accept defeat in love and Daya's a gangster<eos> I don't want a gangster's shadow to be cast on our child<eos> The family and surroundings I'm taking you to... is a place where only decent folks live<eos> My parents haven't even sworn at anyone<eos> If they get to know that you and a gangster were...
All because of that day 523 years ago.<eos> I would have been so very content!<eos> But now...<eos> That thought has passed... there's no way you could possibly defeat me!<eos> Those who are destined to defeat monsters are always human!<eos> To be bested by anything less than human is unacceptable!<eos> Integra...<eos> This world plays host to several seemingly immortal monsters... a curious question comes to mind...<eos> Could they really have desired their immortality?<eos> They all appear to seek out war...

Leaving nothing but tears and anguish in their wake...<eos> I don't think that's what they want at all.
Is it ok to just leave the child in such a winter night?<eos> You don't know anything.<eos> The children come back every year during this season.<eos> They appear after the passing rain.<eos> Why don't you let him in?<eos> He's your son right?<eos> That is not our child!<eos> I don't think he is even a human anymore.<eos> We have no clue to control them... once they entered out housed.<eos> They act up for small matters... and even killed their parents.
What a coincidence."<eos> "We are sisters, aren't we?" "Well, lets have another glass."<eos> "Tankard you mean," Mary laughed.<eos> So they had themselves another three beers.<eos> "So, how exactly does my man blow off the foam..." Bara mused.<eos> And for a while they couldn't drink for all the laughing.<eos> Bara was the first to down her drink and catch her breath.<eos> "Those men of yours, they didn't even teach you how to drink beer."<eos> "Your man is as good as ours and that's not saying much."<eos> "They are brothers, aren't they?" Tilda headed straight for the bar.
On the roof of the world, in the palace of the Great Snowman.<eos> The Snowman threw a feast of rare moss, lichen and edelweiss, he took Tom Thumb to his museum, where he would live from now on.<eos> He had there a great collection of miniatures, the whole Koran written on a wild cherry stone, a cannon fuelled by one grain of gunpowder, and other wonders.<eos> "Amongst all these treasures you will be my greatest treasure.<eos> My only living miniature," with that he concluded the tour.<eos> "And when I die? !"<eos> The giant grew sad. "I'll erect the tiniest tombstone ever."<eos> "Hm, hm, that won't make me a living miniature.<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> If I marry and have children, they will survive me, and they'll be even smaller than me!
We have only each other.<eos> This is not the time.<eos> We have all sent our husbands and sons to war.<eos> We all have to do our part.<eos> At least you'll have a little one to carry on your name.<eos> I can't eat with you like that.<eos> What am I going to do after you die?<eos> I'm not in the coffin yet.<eos> The men never come home, not even a soul.<eos> They'll never let you come home.
Sure she went to the game?<eos> If she didn't, how did her brothers know?<eos> God knows what they'll do to find her.<eos> I hope I find her before they do.
So if we shoot these tiny bits through two slits... we should get, like the marbles, two bands.<eos> What?<eos> An interference pattern.<eos> We fired electrons, tiny bits of matter, through.<eos> But we get a pattern like waves... not like little marbles.<eos> How?<eos> How could pieces of matter... create an interference pattern like a wave?<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> But physicists are clever.<eos> They thought, "Maybe those little balls are bouncing off each other... and creating that pattern."
[ Man ] We are always the observer.<eos> But sometimes we identify with the events so much so... that we even lose the aspect of the observer.<eos> That's why the materialist gets totally lost... and thinks that we could do without the observer.<eos> [ Man #2 ] The physics data tells us that the- that an object itself is really a simplification... for what's we call "out there. "<eos> One is particularly<eos> - When we're looking at atomic and subatomic particles... or atomic and subatomic matter in any form... what we find is how we go to look at it... or what we choose to examine it with... actually changes the properties of what we observe to be out there.<eos> Is this the observer... and which is so intricate to understanding... the wacky, weird world... of quantum particles and how they react?<eos> Is this then the observer?<eos> And even though we cannot have a quantum field... without the observation of scientists who have gone there... who have uncovered it layer after layer after layer.<eos> They're all observers... but not one of them agree conclusively... on all points in the field... because they're perceiving the field mathematically... from different angles of perception.
Aliens?<eos> Loch Ness monster?<eos> Or a hot date?<eos> We took two simple black boxes like this.<eos> Inside is a very simple electric circuit... with a few diodes, oscillator, EPROM... some resistors and capacitors.<eos> Basically, that's it.<eos> We wrap one in aluminum foil.<eos> We put it in an electrically-grounded Faraday cage.<eos> The other we set on a tabletop around which... four very well-qualified meditators- highly inner-self-managed individuals- sit.<eos> And they go into a deep meditative state.
I was approached six months ago by a man named James Nathanson. He was my contact.<eos> - Who is he?<eos> - Former CIA.<eos> Said he was recruiting like-minded individuals for this initiative.<eos> Initiative?<eos> Is that what you call this?<eos> You helped terrorists acquire weaponised nerve gas!<eos> We were going to trigger the canisters once they reached their base in central Asia.<eos> - This was not supposed to happen. - It happened!<eos> You got into bed with them and they're threatening to use the gas on US citizens.
You'll just come to work with me.<eos> But you don't have a job.<eos> All right, here, tell you what we're going to do...<eos> We are going to stuff each one of these gift bags with a head shot, some glitter, and a decorative hand soap.<eos> And we're going to send them to every casting director in town.<eos> And don't forget the funny notes.<eos> "I know where you live.<eos> Ha-ha."<eos> Casting directors hate this.<eos> They really do.
Uncle, that's what all tea is.<eos> How can a member of my own family say something so horrible?<eos> We'll have to make some major changes around here.<eos> The Upper Ring is home to our most important citizens.<eos> Your house is not too far from here.<eos> What's inside that wall?<eos> And who are the mean looking guys in robes?<eos> Inside is the Royal Palace.<eos> Those men are agents of the Dai Li, the cultural authority of Ba Sing Se.<eos> They are the guardians of all our traditions.
Your father would never do what to you?<eos> What is going on here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's time for a talk.<eos> Azula always lies?<eos> Azula always lies?<eos> Azula always lies?<eos> You have to help. It's Lee. The thugs from town came back as soon as Gansu left.<eos> When they ordered us to give them food, Lee pulled a knife on them. I don't even know where he got a knife!<eos> Then they took him away. They told me if he's old enough to fight, he's old enough to join the army.
So you killed him.<eos> I gave you the killer.<eos> The murder weapon, the prints. Everything you needed to close the case legitimately.<eos> Despite the President's objections, the fleet needs us.<eos> Rationing's too tight, ship comes in too late, we're the pressure valve, we provide.<eos> When Shevon needed antibiotics, she knew where to go.<eos> Without us, people would have nowhere to turn.<eos> The fleet would tear itself apart.<eos> And what about those children outside ?<eos> How are they... helping the fleet ?
They've contacted me through the Gemenon representative.<eos> My parents?<eos> Oh, gods.<eos> Do you have any idea what they would do to me?<eos> Please, do not send me back.<eos> You're a stowaway aboard a military ship.<eos> Some people might say she was a victim of political persecution.<eos> Hell, she could apply for asylum.<eos> Asylum. That's it. I want asylum.<eos> Under Gemenon law, the girl is still the property of her parents, and they can deal with her once she's safely back on her ship.
- It needs a whole new unit.<eos> Well, Barb can get one at the store.<eos> - Well, Barb's not here.<eos> - Talk to her when she gets back.<eos> This isn't exactly an efficient system.<eos> Do you think she's happy for me... about the baby?<eos> Of course.<eos> She loves babies.<eos> Sometimes I think she wishes my boys were hers.<eos> Sometimes I think they wish the same thing.
It would dry up and blow away and you with it!<eos> I'm the big gun on this boat, the captain!<eos> And you're nothing but a skinny, overpaid deckhand!<eos> No, I am the deckhand who steers the ship, because the captain isn't up to it anymore!<eos> Get out.<eos> Look over the new document, sign it and get it back to me today.<eos> I'm not signing anything.<eos> I can't believe we're here today because these parents care too much about their child.<eos> The truth is our children are growing up in a frighteningly competitive world.<eos> They'll face global competition the likes of which we've never seen before, and we are unprepared.

She said so many times.<eos> Is there any doubt in your mind that Mrs Myerson wanted to end her life?<eos> None.<eos> She asked me to help her.<eos> I said I couldn't legally.<eos> And that's when she turned to her husband.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Helloooo...<eos> Whaddya think?<eos> I'm curious to your thoughts, if they involve me putting that on in this life time...
I'm beholden to no one.<eos> I know all my constituents by name.<eos> I know what they do for a living.<eos> I know the names of their kids.<eos> I'd get lonely in washington.<eos> You must do something.<eos> What do you do?<eos> You work?<eos> Oh, I have 3 kids.<eos> They keep me very busy.
You're better than that.<eos> "Courage is being scared to death and saddling up anyway." Know who said that?<eos> Your fucking hero.<eos> John Wayne.<eos> What the fuck are you talking about?<eos> I'm trying to give you your balls back, Harry.<eos> You wanna give me something, Michael?<eos> How about my life?<eos> My kids!<eos> How about the 5 fucking years they took from me?
We know there's a bill before the house, but since you basically control the house,<eos> Tommy Felte should make our pitch directly to you.<eos> You brought me a couple of sharpies.<eos> I don't wanna shatter any illusions, but we got 75 independent-minded legislators up there.<eos> I got about as much control as a kindergarten teacher.<eos> Thanks, Tommy.<eos> That said, let's see what you got.<eos> Here's our project and a rough projection of the tax incentives it would take to bring our development dollars to Rhode Island.<eos> Speak, you know my financial ties to these gentlemen.<eos> Yeah, they renovate the mill, you make money.
- Right.<eos> You said that.<eos> - He's a professional athlete.<eos> - And you, what about you?<eos> What do you do?<eos> - I'm in fashion.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> - I have the worst luck with men.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> They're either jerks or they leave me, or they get killed.
So they never met?<eos> I hope not<eos> Trevor talked about it sometimes<eos> What do you mean?<eos> He thought he could reason with my step-father<eos> A sweet naive kid sitting down with a monster<eos> I thought I'd made him happy<eos> Give him a reason to live, but<eos> Trevor's parents never knew about me either<eos> They never knew that somebody loved him
Was my real motherbeautiful?<eos> Well,she was,uh, attractive,as I recall.<eos> Do I look like her?<eos> I don't know.I-I only met her once.<eos> Well,'cause ifI don't look like her,then I might look likemy real dad.<eos> I'm getting real tiredof your morbid fascination with two strangers who didn'tlove you enough to keep you.<eos> So,please,stop asking about them.<eos> It's only natural that I'd wannatalk about my birth parents.<eos> Well, it may be natural, but it certainlyisn't polite.<eos> and onceyour daughter was dead,they had to get ridof her somehow.
Miss Tillman?<eos> Where did this come from?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It was in with your other mail.<eos> Get me the phone.<eos> Sullivan, it's me.<eos> I just got some news, and I need to get you involved.<eos> Looks like Delfino's been holding out on me.<eos> The next morning, Bree came up with a plan to get to the truth she so desperately needed.<eos> As she watched the Applewhites leave their house, she thought of how much she had trusted the previous owners and how much they... had trusted her.
Actually, I already had.<eos> This dinner is really good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Hi, Betty.<eos> - Hello.<eos> I wanted to talk to you about what happened the other day with the kids.<eos> I told you, we will be moving soon.<eos> There's nothing to worry about.<eos> Well, my fear is that if we keep them apart, they'll try that much harder to be together.
- That is difficult to believe.<eos> - Nevertheless, you must believe me.<eos> Now, let me go back to Earth... and I'll give you my personal assurance... that your ambassadors will be returned to you.<eos> But you do not even know where they are.<eos> From the information that you've given me, I'll find them.<eos> Now, please, you must let me try.<eos> Very well.<eos> But if our ambassadors are not returned, we shall use our weapons to destroy your world.<eos> These three men, can I take them back with me?<eos> They will remain here until our ambassadors are returned.
Why are you up so early?<eos> Oh, well, you know me.<eos> I do, so why are you up so early?<eos> I have chores.<eos> It's 6:00 in the morning.<eos> Well, it's early morning chores.<eos> What's early morning chores?<eos> You know, just milking cows, feeding chickens, slopping pigs.<eos> You have to slop pigs?<eos> They're certainly not gonna slop themselves.
Is that why you're so sad?<eos> Oh, aren't you adorable?<eos> I'm not sad, I'm complicated.<eos> Chicks dig that.<eos> One day you'll understand.<eos> That's what my parents say when they don't want me to know something.<eos> They say that a lot?<eos> Only when they're talking about making babies and stuff.<eos> When you catch them fighting?<eos> They don't fight.
I would like to propose a toast... to the most awesomely mellow anniversary ever.<eos> I'm so glad you have to go to your parents next weekend.<eos> I'm so glad your roommates are out of town.<eos> (WHISPERING) Oh, my God!<eos> What are they doing home?<eos> They think we went away.<eos> Oh, it is on for my boy Ted!<eos> But we didn't go away.<eos> We're in the bathroom.<eos> Well, they don't know that.
-Not just them.<eos> Captain Cold and the Trickster.<eos> That's four super-criminals with an axe to grind.<eos> If there were some way to hunt them down we could eliminate these dogs before they strike again.<eos> Look, I'll just round them all up tomorrow.<eos> They all hang out at this little hole-in-the-wall on 4th Street.<eos> My plan was solid.<eos> I mean, what's so special about a disco of death?<eos> Heck with all of them.<eos> I'm an artist, they're just robbing banks.
C'mon, a little levity never hurt anybody's sex life.<eos> Okay, so. What time do you put Angelica down to sleep?<eos> Oh, well, it differs every night. We don't really have her on a schedule.<eos> Yeah. Tonight, get her to sleep, put her in the crib -<eos> No, we don't put her down. We're practicing attachment parenting.<eos> We try to keep her in contact with another human body as much as possible.<eos> Where is she right now?<eos> My turn.<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> I wouldn't say my parents are happy about it, necessarily, I would just say that they've... they've accepted it, sort of in their own way.
The bank probably wouldn't even...<eos> Put that away!<eos> No, wait, let me see it again!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> No, we're not going to do this.<eos> Honey, you are looking at this all wrong.<eos> We will pay him back.<eos> We are like a bank.<eos> And banks don't give you back the same exact money that you gave them.<eos> They use it, and then pay you back with different money later on.
A couple months later,I was deep into the program. You know, the 12 steps?<eos> And I had taken all my personal inventory and now it was time for step nine:<eos> making amends.<eos> I went to David's hospital room, all ready to tell him what I'd done, you know, accept responisibility,take the consequences.<eos> And that's when I realized he didn't remember me.<eos> He didn't remember anything.<eos> His life before that night--it was a blank.<eos> He had been in the hospital for months with his friends coming by every day, trying to fill in his memory for him, reminding him that, uh, he loved watching baseball.<eos> That his favorite food was pizza.<eos> Of course they couldn't fill him in... on the parts of his life that they didn't know anything about-- the cruising, the girls off the street.
Especially nowadays.<eos> It's like they don't want their children to grow up.<eos> Didn't used to be like that.<eos> Like in the pioneer days a girl your age would be practically old enough to get married.<eos> You know that Juliet was only 13.<eos> Really? 13?<eos> The word "teenager" didn't even exist until 50 or 60 years ago.<eos> It was only invented to help parents prolong childhood for as long as possible.<eos> My point is... you know that you're mature and responsible, even if your parents haven't caught on yet.<eos> They don't need to know all your business.
I don't...<eos> I don't who would have left gum in here.<eos> It wasn't karma again, was it?<eos> No, no.<eos> Some thing's are just accidents.<eos> Blinded by a beautiful woman wearing shoes that make her calves pop out real nice, well, I forgot that in my world, things are never just accidents, they happen for a reason.<eos> I had promised to take care of something on my list ?<eos> Randy.<eos> These guys are so smart, Earl.<eos> They figured out how to put booze in food.
Bye, Damian.<eos> Let me give you a hand there.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You're the one that was chasing that kid earlier.<eos> That's right.<eos> Who are you after now?<eos> I'm not after anyone.<eos> Don't get me wrong, those that run need chasing.<eos> It's the kids I worry about.<eos> They can still be saved.
Both.<eos> I was able to discover a pattern.<eos> Nine shootings, all of them connected, right?<eos> With Agent Rhimes, you've got ten.<eos> Connected, as in all part of the same chain?<eos> No. Each one of the ten is the start of its own shooting chain.<eos> And Don, I think they're all the work of the same killer.<eos> So you're saying Rhimes' killer is responsible for ten murders?<eos> No, far more.<eos> I mean, he may have pulled the trigger on those ten murders, but they aren't his only victims.
Oh, God!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I thought you liked him.<eos> And if you keep him out on the porch much longer, you're going to lose him.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Burton's totally fine with it.<eos> He wants me to take my time.<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> Guys need to know they're moving towards a goal.<eos> They need to know when they're winning.
He wants me to take my time.<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> Guys need to know they're moving towards a goal.<eos> They need to know when they're winning.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's why we like sports.<eos> And war.<eos> Well, he's not going to break up with me just because I'm not ready to move forward. Is he?<eos> Men don't like stop signs.<eos> They like green lights.
The mature worms release about 3 micrograms of phorbols per hour.<eos> The boy I examined: 62 worms.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> - That's 4.464 milligrams per day.<eos> Enough to raise your PKC, so you're suicidally depressed.<eos> - Where are the worms coming from?<eos> - They lay their eggs in the water.<eos> -That's where their life cycle begins.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> They're mimicking Nematomorph hairworms.
Yeah, good. I gotta get my kids home.<eos> But I'll see you then, okay?<eos> See you.<eos> Just got this case an hour ago.<eos> Why is my client arrested for murder when another boy was arrested?<eos> I'm sure you've heard Every-Day's attorney is making my life hell.<eos> She's taken depositions from half the high school.<eos> Depositions listing you as the shooter. Bullshit.<eos> My friends were there.<eos> They saw Every-Day pull that gun.
Suddenly, he fires a seasoned political consultant... and takes the girl on the campaign trail.<eos> Until it all goes wrong... and the spurned lover gets her revenge.<eos> Now, just aim at Jonathan's head and shoot.<eos> Didn't General Lane teach you anything?<eos> Actually, he did.<eos> Get down, sir.<eos> Martha?<eos> - Don't sweat it, Smallville.<eos> Better late than never.<eos> "Regard your soldiers as your children... and they will follow you into the deepest valleys."
sorry, but there are people down here who need a lot more help than finding some missing timex.<eos> it belonged to my dad.<eos> you lost him, didn't you ?<eos> and you can't say goodbye.<eos> what makes you say that ?<eos> because i've never been able to.<eos> my mom and i were coming home from my gymnastics meet. and these two guys mugged us.<eos> i didn't even feel the knife go into my heart.<eos> but when i looked up... i saw her lying there.<eos> and they walked away... is that why you do this ?
It's all in your mind.<eos> Don't you find this completely embarrassing?<eos> What?<eos> This, our family.<eos> Our father gets shot by our goober fucking uncle?<eos> - What is that?<eos> - Yeah, it's embarrassing.<eos> I don't want to think about what Finn's parents are saying.<eos> I mean, I don't really give a shit about my friends.<eos> They know what Dad does, but like, some of them remember Uncle Junior.
who gives a shit?<eos> i mean i had a second chance. why shouldn't he?<eos> part of your new outlook?<eos> maybe.<eos> i salute it, then.<eos> tall fuckin' order, i'll tell you that.<eos> how so?<eos> you can talk about every day being a gift and stopping to smell the roses, but regular life's got a way of picking away at it.<eos> your house, the shit you own, it drags you down.<eos> your kids, what they want.
yeah, i don't know.<eos> what the fuck?<eos> what is there to think about?<eos> - sit down.<eos> - fuck that!<eos> i'll say it again!<eos> what the fuck is there to think about?<eos> you gonna take care of his kids, huh, after he's gone?<eos> it's true.<eos> they didn't do nothing.
Give him a break, will ya?<eos> It's an emotional day.<eos> To cry like a woman?<eos> It's a fucking disgrace.<eos> His fucking coach turned into a pumpkin.<eos> Well, even Cinderella didn't cry.<eos> When it comes to daughters, all bets are off.<eos> I've seen tougher guys than John cry at weddings.<eos> Well, let me ask you this--<eos> If they can make him cry and if he's that weak, what the fuck else can they make him do?
There was enough data for us to summise what this so-called anti-Ori weapon might be.<eos> Really?<eos> I wasn't able to make heads or tails of it.<eos> Really?<eos> Just tell me what you've got.<eos> It is an energy transfer device, similar to a Zero Point Module, except that the energy is channeled not from subspace into ordinary space-time, but rather, into the dimension occupied by ascended beings.<eos> And this energy is harmful to them in some way?<eos> It is a form of interference.<eos> A simple analogy would be two standing waves canceling each other out.<eos> If the weapon indeed works the way Merlin's writings imply, we would simply need to activate it, and send it to the Ori galaxy, and they would be eliminated.
Like a word, please.<eos> Come on. I'm having a bad day already.<eos> You don't want to make it worse.<eos> So, what, are you on some kind of vacation or something?<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> It's all sipping Cristal poolside for me.<eos> No.<eos> I had to get away from my family.<eos> Why?<eos> I love my parents, and they wanted what's best for me.
I don't understand why these people would be after you.<eos> No, not just people, okay?<eos> We're talking about the Agency of Strategic Intelligence.<eos> Did they show a warrant or a subpoena?<eos> Um, no, these guys were more like, uh, the mob.<eos> What were they gonna do?<eos> I mean, the story's already out there.<eos> They can discredit the story.<eos> We're the only living witnesses.<eos> That's right, it's the living part they got a problem with.
You want order, you got to level with us.<eos> You got one or not?<eos> We have a specimen.<eos> Whether it's the same species we're looking for, we can't be sure at this point.<eos> Eggs.<eos> Washed up on Wrightsville Beach.<eos> A week ago, we lost a son there.<eos> My wife and I.<eos> He was swimming at that beach just like I do and just--just like you do and just like all our children do.<eos> And what have they done?
- Tights?<eos> My husband in tights? - Mrs. Santos.<eos> - Lock up the women's vote.<eos> - You've never seen his legs.<eos> - We're late.<eos> If we...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Where are my kids?<eos> - They're in the press van.<eos> They're getting a head start on trick-or-treating.
Sure.<eos> We could...<eos> Hold it.<eos> Did you lock up on Friday?<eos> Does it look like anything's missing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I can't tell.<eos> Must be those kids again.<eos> We'd had a few half-assed break-ins over the past year- kids after prescription pads, drugs.<eos> I just assumed that they were responsible.
She was killed this morning.<eos> What?<eos> We think she was murdered.<eos> That's impossible, I mean... She was one of the nicest people.<eos> Who would do something like that?<eos> We were actually hoping that you might have an idea.<eos> No, um, she really kept to herself.<eos> The necklace, I have to ask: did you...<eos> No, but now that we know what it is, we'll alert the local pawn shops.<eos> They'll be on the lookout.
What I know of Coffey, he's a pretty shadowy guy.<eos> He works out of the White House...<eos> Connor, I think this thing in the Middle East...<eos> Lethargica...<eos> I think there could be a direct link to the White House.<eos> Really?<eos> And something else... the Manford brothers showed up at David's last night.<eos> Are they in custody?<eos> Let's walk.<eos> They wanted to stop the war in Iraq by infecting the troops.

With all those labs focused on the same problem we should have enough Lethargica in about 48 hours.<eos> Just in time.<eos> Outstanding work.<eos> So about the Manford brothers...<eos> Yeah.<eos> What happened to them?<eos> - I thought you could tell me.<eos> - Oh no.<eos> In all the confusion...<eos> I just... But you know, they said they tought somebody was trying to kill them.
It'll never be like it used to be.<eos> Yes, well, it's a passable voice.<eos> It's richer than Connor's, so that's all to the good. He's a charmer, isn't he?<eos> You've noticed.<eos> Right, uh, I daresay you all want to get away, so let's just have one last go at our Farmer piece.<eos> # Fair Phylis I saw sitting all alone #<eos> # Feeding her flock near to the mountainside #<eos> # Fair Phylis I saw sitting all alone #<eos> # Feeding her flock near to the mountainside #<eos> # The shepherds knew not, they knew not #
- Is that you ?<eos> - Who's this ?<eos> - You know me as Michael.<eos> - Sorry, got the wrong number.<eos> Ronon and Dr. mckay are still alive.<eos> - What are you gonna do with them ?<eos> - If you want them to live, listen to me.<eos> If your friends are in pursuit, you need to disable these ships for them to reach us.<eos> If you really wanna help, why don't you just do that ?<eos> - They would know. - Aren't you " they" ou " ?
The ambassadors have finished convening.<eos> Oh, good timing. Yes.<eos> They'd like to continue debriefing you now.<eos> - Yeah, I bet they would.<eos> - Excuse me ?<eos> No. I'm not gonna sit there and have them rake me over the coals about every decision I've made that they don't agree with in hindsight.<eos> I have the greatest respect for you but as far as the I. O.A. is concerned you're not exactly the employee of the month.<eos> If the Wraith make it to Earth, keeping my job will be the least of my concerns.<eos> - And if your plan succeeds ?<eos> - Then I expect to keep my job, yes. Because I did what they apparently are incapable of doing. I made a decision.
Back to work<eos> Boss, you were looking for me?<eos> Yes, I need you to represent me at a dinner<eos> What dinner?<eos> Having dinner with some business friends<eos> They want to discuss how to boycott Boss White<eos> Boss White?<eos> The Stock Killer?<eos> That's right<eos> They think he's too power hungry and immoral
This setup is even suitable for a kid's film<eos> He can't see a thing.<eos> What's the big fuss?<eos> In the past, if a woman removed poison like this she had to marry the guy<eos> What century is this?<eos> If that were true, all women would have to marry their gynecologist<eos> Put some clothes on. I want to talk to you<eos> Phoenix, this guy is in deep trouble<eos> Those killers won't let him go<eos> If they were as good at kung fu as you said then they must work for White Eyebrows
My Dad said that you were living down here with your girlfriend.<eos> You know about her?<eos> Who?<eos> Ann.<eos> Her?<eos> Gob had been dating Ann since he awarded her third place in an inner-beauty pageant.<eos> Since then, Ann and her friends tried to teach Gob about the Holy Trinity...<eos> What?<eos> I thought that's what all you guys lived for!<eos> ...while Gob debased everything they believed in.
Whoever was here had some big shoes.<eos> Not necessarily big feet.<eos> Multiple socks.<eos> Another precaution to cover your tracks.<eos> Assuming it's our guy.<eos> I'd say it's our guy.<eos> And I think he just gave us the finger.<eos> I have an update for you.<eos> The burned gloves that Nick submitted are lambskin lined with rabbit's fur.<eos> They're consistent with the fibers found in Ally Sullivan's necklace.
I don't mind.<eos> But it's in my mailbox down in the lobby.<eos> Well, should we go get it?<eos> If you want to carry me down the stairs.<eos> Well, we'll take the elevator.<eos> I don't trust elevators.<eos> They break, fall, and paralyze people.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Elevators are perfectly safe.<eos> I mean, they're not just gonna...
Who's there?<eos> Who's there?<eos> Who's there?<eos> 6:00 a.m. is early for a guy like me, but I was determined that today would be the day that I gave Hank his good day.<eos> All right, let's get going.<eos> Hank is waiting.<eos> Okey-dokey. Hey, you have to take her drops.<eos> What?<eos> Her eye drops.<eos> You have to put drops in her eyes every ten minutes or they'll dry out and the lids will stick to the balls.
And then, for fun, I took 12 more.<eos> My mom and the doctors called it an accident.<eos> And then two weeks later, when I got back to school, nobody noticed.<eos> It was like I never left.<eos> I guess that's the upside to not being there in the first place, right?<eos> Nobody misses you when you're gone.<eos> It's not supposed to be this way.<eos> The artists and the scientists and poets, none of them fit in at 17.<eos> You're supposed to get past it.<eos> Adults, they see kids killing kids, and they know it's a tragedy because they used to be those kids.
No dealers.<eos> Just shit they scraped out of nuclear reactors.<eos> Half life is 4.5 billion years.<eos> We get to Bagdad, everything is cool.<eos> That's when Saddam got his 4th of July.<eos> Then 4 black men get strung up in Felucca, everything goes to shit.<eos> They ordered us to, capture the responsible parties.<eos> The hell, everyone's responsible.<eos> What the fuck were those contractors doing there in the first place?<eos> So they get shot and we have to waste an entire city.
Come on, Annie!<eos> - Race you back.<eos> - Let's go!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> I'm coming!<eos> What's this concert you're missing?<eos> It's just my granddaughter's piano recital.<eos> Man, she sure is cute when she does that.<eos> That's the crap I missed first time around with my boys.<eos> Now they got kids of their own.
John Bauers, convicted of multiple counts of rape.<eos> Calvin Stevens, convicted of sodomizing and molesting over a dozen boys ages six to ten.<eos> This is a list of registered sex-offenders.<eos> This is the list the prosecutor thinks Ms. Levine should be put on.<eos> This is the company they think she belongs in.<eos> Do you?<eos> Do any of you think that a woman who bared her breasts at a political rally poses the same risk to the community as rapists and child molesters?<eos> Of course you don't.<eos> And I'll let you in on a little secret.<eos> Neither do they.
Finding a good man is about as easy as finding a cab in a snowstorm... on new year's eve.<eos> that's what my mother used to say.<eos> You know what I say?<eos> (All) stinkin' thinkin'!<eos> (Chuckles) yes!<eos> Hello, I'm marin frist.<eos> I am a relationship coach.<eos> I've got news for you.<eos> There are plenty of guys out there.<eos> They are not the problem, ladies.
What blind spots?<eos> What's he saying?<eos> You're punting on first down.<eos> Show me.<eos> Can you get a little tighter with the talon?<eos> I've got two visuals, but stationary.<eos> He's got mobility.<eos> Can i see the rest of those? Woman:<eos> We want these guys here? Bluman:<eos> If this goes bad, nobody knows who they are and they got no paper trail. Any more questions?
He always loved music and photography.<eos> Shooting videos, he could do both.<eos> Did Terry have an active social life?<eos> He dated a lot.<eos> Girls liked him.<eos> I have to ask.<eos> Was he in the habit of having one-night stands?<eos> Do you have children, Mr. Stark?<eos> A 16-year-old daughter.<eos> Then you know once they start to grow up, they don't always tell you everything.
All right?<eos> Let's do that.<eos> Oh, my gosh, why is it so cold in here?<eos> I don't want to lose what little of her I've got.<eos> When you pull a body out of the water, putrefaction goes into overdrive.<eos> Well, tell me you at least have enough for cause of death.<eos> Don't know yet.<eos> What I can tell you is, her fingers were cut off.<eos> Are you sure it wasn't the wildlife?<eos> No. They only go for the meaty parts the lips, ears.
- Just... No!<eos> Hey, come on, let finish your flying lesson.<eos> Shut up.<eos> She wouldn't stop screaming.<eos> People were going to hear.<eos> I had to shut her up.<eos> Hey, for the record, I didn't have anything to do with that Rowe chick.<eos> I just don't want those papers to start printing those lies again.<eos> What lies?<eos> They made me out to be some kind of Hannibal Lecter, said I cut off her fingers and ate them.
I already told you.<eos> In this room, people tell me all sorts of things.<eos> You can, too.<eos> And I'll listen and not leave you, like everyone else has left you.<eos> - To die alone.<eos> - Like those boys died?<eos> How you must hate them.<eos> So young.<eos> Their lives just starting.<eos> They get into cars with strangers and believe they'll live forever.
And I'll listen and not leave you, like everyone else has left you.<eos> - To die alone.<eos> - Like those boys died?<eos> How you must hate them.<eos> So young.<eos> Their lives just starting.<eos> They get into cars with strangers and believe they'll live forever.<eos> - You think that's a crime?<eos> - It is because they won't.<eos> They should know that and not be disappointed later.
Nobody drove those kids to that diner.<eos> There's over 1,000 places in Queens alone. They could have dumped Jennifer in the car.<eos> We don't even have a place to start.<eos> You can start by thinking about what the hell you're doing before you do it.<eos> Here we go.<eos> I tried to reach you. Your secretary said you were giving a speech.<eos> You guaranteed an indictment, on the record, in open court?<eos> I had no choice.<eos> We're gonna be lucky if we don't get sued by those three boys for false arrest.<eos> We know they did it, Mr. Branch.
I can't.<eos> Am I interrupting something?<eos> -No.<eos> -Not at all.<eos> -Huh.<eos> Apparently.<eos> -So, what did you get?<eos> Pay dirt.<eos> The surviving relatives of the Merchant family were so ashamed of Isaiah, they didn't want him interred with the family.<eos> They handed him over to the county.
I won't take orders from the White House.<eos> I won't have the caucus to the left, but you'll know what I'm doing and bill of yours dies, blame me.<eos> My bigger concern is that a bill might not make it to the House floor.<eos> - Try me.<eos> Lobbying reform.<eos> H.R. One. First bill I want you to take up.<eos> We both know my best chance to pass something is right out of the gate.<eos> You wanna waste that chance on a process issue banning martini lunches?<eos> I wanna ban all political donations by registered lobbyists.<eos> They'll turn around, demand clients write checks...
Right, but, I don't know how to get in or out of the Avatar State.<eos> Much less what to do once I'm there.<eos> So it's decided then<eos> I'll help you figure out how to get into the Avatar State and then you'll face your destiny.<eos> No, nothing's decided.<eos> We already have a plan.<eos> Aang's pursuing his destiny his way.<eos> Well, while you take your time learning the elements, the war goes on.<eos> May I show you something?<eos> That's the infirmary, and those soldiers are the lucky ones... they came back.
Go ahead.<eos> Carla? Prego!<eos> Oh, my God, Turk.<eos> Carla must be so happy.<eos> I haven't told her.<eos> I'm gonna now.<eos> Wait, Turk. When has a man ever been able to tell his wife that she's pregnant?<eos> Allow me to paint you a picture with my imagination brush. OK?<eos> You two come out in the parking lot where Carla's friends have gathered.<eos> They're holding a banner that says, "Carla, you're pregnant and I dove you."
Royce's negatives are up... even among black voters.<eos> Yeah.<eos> In a minute, Norman.<eos> You know what I think, Tommy?<eos> No matter what, you got your name out there, and it'll help you down the road if you ever want to step up to the legislature.<eos> But as one paisan to another, the day of the white mayor is over in this town.<eos> Excuse me, Your Eminence.<eos> You're due at the Baylor-Edison Senior Center, and I don't want to be lying to a roomful of wrinkle-assed voters because you wanted to talk shop all the damn morning.<eos> Seniors, huh?<eos> They vote, Tommy.
They only waited this long out of respect to Tony Gray.<eos> Otherwise, they give it to Royce months ago.<eos> That's not the point.<eos> You go there uninvited, and you're only gonna piss them off.<eos> Am I?<eos> Or do I piss them off even more by pretending that they don't exist, that I don't need them?<eos> I've door-to-doored every neighborhood in this city, saying I'm ready to be mayor to all of it, not just my base, but all of it.<eos> What does it say I don't go see these guys?<eos> He's right.<eos> They endorse Royce, fine.

We're going to the Valley, Drama, not the Sahara.<eos> Hey, don't kid yourself, E. North of Ventura Boulevard is Hell's waiting room.<eos> Be prepared.<eos> If you keep drinking we're gonna have to stop every 20' for you to take a leak.<eos> That's what the empties are for.<eos> Don't even think about pulling your dick out in my car, Drama.<eos> - Hey, Ari.<eos> - "Aquaman" is making waves, pal.<eos> The first East Coast numbers are in.<eos> They're projecting $100 mil.
What about that book club? Am I right?<eos> What do you see as the Abbotts' greatest weakness as potential adoptive parents?<eos> Oh.<eos> Well, that's a hard one.<eos> Maybe Harold's a little too organized.<eos> He likes to have things in their place.<eos> Do you think that will be a problem with a young child running around the house?<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> I mean, he's already raised two children.<eos> I'm sure their house was very chaotic when they were growing up.
What do you know about a janitor named Lucky?<eos> Why?<eos> Meg had a lot to say about him.<eos> This is so cool.<eos> Yeah, it's just dreamy.<eos> I really want to spend eternity like a plastic scuba diver in someone's fish tank.<eos> So, Meg, what's with that guy, Lucky?<eos> Your parents' friend from church?<eos> Can't picture them wanting to set you up with someone.<eos> They weren't outwardly setting us up.
-Hi.<eos> So, what's a booty call?<eos> I figured you didn't want me telling him.<eos> Was I wrong?<eos> Uh, uh... uh, well, uh, Jake, it-it means, uh, that... uh, that Kandi came by to-to, uh, to do her laundry.<eos> I don't see any laundry.<eos> Good-good point, Charlie.<eos> Always the eye for detail.<eos> Uh... well, uh, you see, Jake, um... in the Old West... uh, uh, cowboys could be out on the dusty range uh, uh, for months at a time, and, uh, they'd get mighty dirty.<eos> Um, so, they'd, uh, they'd, uh, mosey into town, uh, with nothing but the clothes on their backs, and they'd need to-to wash 'em.
John cassavettes and charles bronson.<eos> You've been tataken, pick.<eos> He's giving you the plot to the dirty dozen.<eos> Think that's funny?<eos> You don't kill that boy, or you do kill him and any of his mates lives, we better take a head count of our family members, 'cause my men motivated and angry will not be deterred.<eos> He's sedated.<eos> Versed.<eos> It's an amnesiac.<eos> He won't remember.<eos> He dies, they'll remember.
All the men were taken away. That was the last time I saw my father.<eos> I haven't seen my father in many years. Oh.<eos> The tunnels... they're a-changin'. Ah, it must be the curse.<eos> I knew we shouldn't have come down here. Right. If only we listened to you.<eos> It's a giant flying thing with teeth!<eos> No!<eos> Yeah, it's no use. We're separated. But at least you have us, heh heh.<eos> Can I join you? I know what you've been through.<eos> We've all been through it.<eos> It's okay. They've hurt me, too.
TJ?<eos> Deep breaths.<eos> Hang in there, sir.<eos> Frank.<eos> Both guys were shot in the back of the head.<eos> - Execution-style.<eos> - Yeah<eos> One rots, one lives for now.<eos> IDs?<eos> They're brothers.
But seriously, what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?<eos> A saleswoman has a vagina.<eos> It's a joke, Dwight, it's not a sex ed class.<eos> But I'm right.<eos> Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke.<eos> All right? The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman is boobs.<eos> Hey, do you remember the speeches that you gave?<eos> I do, both of them.<eos> Could I have a copy of one of them?<eos> No, no, they would remember.
I'm a little slammed today.<eos> - You can do it now.<eos> - Really?<eos> - You have nothing now.<eos> - I have nothing. Come in.<eos> - How are the twins?<eos> - Oh, amazing.<eos> Inexhaustible.<eos> We spend a lot of time arguing about socks.<eos> - You're pro, they're con?
And I thought he'd be very helpful in letting me know what the future holds for the American people.<eos> Who owns the Federal Reserve?<eos> It's secret and we can't find out what's happening, so, but the Congress created it, and it's not authorized in the Constitution.<eos> The Government borrows money from a private corporation useing the name 'federal' that prints United States on it.<eos> And then it pays back to the Fed, which is owned by private banks. We don't know who all those private banks are.<eos> The money that the government is paying back to the private bankers is the money that comes from you and me.<eos> Why in the world would the American government borrow money and pay fees on it, when it has the authority to make the money itself interest free?<eos> The Federal Reserve is no more federal than Federal Express.<eos> I've never seen a full list of ownership for the Fed, I don't think anybody has.<eos> The Government works for a private bank, and the private bank works for its owners. They're the true masters.
*The creation of secret "watch lists" that ban those named from air and other travel.<eos> "The constituition is just a goddamn piece of paper. "<eos> ~George W. Bush - Nov. 2005 Capital Hill Blue<eos> During the 1990's President Clinton monitored millions of private calls placed by U.S. citizens.<eos> He did this under a secret program code named Echelon.<eos> The widespread use of wiretapping Americans during the Clinton administration proves this practice was not started because of 9/11, but is standard procedure.<eos> What happens if your own government is using more force and more coercion on its own citizens for the purpose of achieving its political ends? Is that government engaging in terrorism?<eos> We are losing our right to property.<eos> The government is gaining more pretext to seize it using... the power to confiscate with eminent domain.<eos> The asset forfeiture loss have proliferated... it's easier for the prosecutors committed to make accusation against you... and confiscate your property even though they have no evidence that you've done anything wrong.
You think that's part of what George Bush said was the one world order?<eos> They can't have a new world order only with, you know, world police, military...<eos> I think the financial system ultimately is even more important than the guns.<eos> The central bankers of the world are working together to create a one world government, a global police state as sinister as anything George Orwell ever wrote about.<eos> Where every person on the planet Earth will have a RFID chip implanted, where the bankers and the governments can monitor every transaction you make.<eos> A chip in everybody would be the universal monitoring system par excellence.<eos> Because there'd be no escape from it and you would be totally under the control of those who issue the electronic impulses in that chip.<eos> Their strategies have been accomplished through the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements, which is the central bank for all the central banks of the world.<eos> Most people don't have a clue that these unelected private bankers actually control the governments of the world.<eos> They have financed and profitted from every war since World War I without concern for humanity.
Well, I think we should start with blood work.<eos> I know when jesse was at the hospital, there was some confusion in the lab about your blood.<eos> Mm-hmm, well, there's no confusion now.<eos> It's definitely changed.<eos> It has much higher levels of hemoglobin.<eos> I think that's why I can stay underwater for so long.<eos> I didn't know that you could.<eos> But none of this is really what you're concerned about, is it?<eos> You want to know if there's something inside me that's gonna hurt our kids.<eos> I just think we owe them an explanation as to why they're not with you anymore, and since we don't have all the answers yet...
Look, Earl, he's got a trampoline.<eos> We should steal it and put it in the motel parking lot.<eos> Then we could use it to go up and down from our room without ever having to use the stairs.<eos> Randy, we're here for the kid, not his trampoline.<eos> Hey, there, little guy.<eos> It's you!<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Take it easy with that fancy hammer, kid.<eos> J-just put it down. I'm just here to talk to you.<eos> I explained my list and the whole boogeyman misunderstanding to Albie, and I realized, if you talk to kids like they're adults, they'll treat you with the same respect.
- We're helping her.<eos> That's what we're doing right now.<eos> Okay, all right, I know this is hard.<eos> Stephanie, I need you to hold it together, can you do that?<eos> Okay.<eos> Tell me a little bit about Kody.<eos> He transferred this year.<eos> He's like a loner.<eos> The football players, they'd screw with him.<eos> - But they screw with everyone.
i'm serious, dean.<eos> i said "fine," sam.<eos> hey, hey.<eos> i think i know what meg meant by "sunrise."<eos> son of a bitch.<eos> that's pretty smart.<eos> if these demons can possess people, they can possess almost anybody inside.<eos> and make anybody attack us.<eos> and so we can't kill 'em -- a building full of human shields.<eos> they probably know exactly what we look like, too, and they could look like anybody.
Policia?<eos> Please, help us.<eos> What's your name, ma'am?<eos> Isabella.<eos> Isabella, were you making drugs in that house?<eos> Yes, we worked for him.<eos> We were prisoners.<eos> So you lived in there? Where are you from, ma'am?<eos> El Salvador.<eos> These men... they come.
Seriously, Mel, where you gonna go?<eos> You leave, you're over.<eos> But that's not where it ended, is it?<eos> You killed Nikki, didn't you, Melinda?<eos> You're over.<eos> No. You are.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't kill Nikki.<eos> The murder weapon had fluorescent UV bulbs.<eos> So? So they shattered when you threw the tanning lamp into the water.
Blimey, are these for real?<eos> For real, I'm telling you, son, my phone has been off the hook<eos> - all morning.<eos> Ringing non-stop.<eos> - Well, this is very exciting, innit?<eos> Yes, it's good, it's very good, but we've got a problem.<eos> What problem?<eos> Most of the money Uncle James raised was from venture capitalists in the city.<eos> Now, I've used them before, you know, financing new acts.<eos> I hit big, they hit big.
We decided against it.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> Because then you wouldn't be a good president.<eos> You wouldn't have suffered enough.<eos> I've been suffering all my life.<eos> I'm sorry, it's not enough.<eos> You know what it's like to be poor, and you know what it's like to work hard.<eos> Now you're going to learn what it's like to sweep floors and bust your ass and accomplish twice as much as all the kids around you.<eos> And it won't mean anything because they will still look down on you.

Dr. Hodgins. ...who brought them back to the Jeffersonian, where they were stolen again?<eos> Re-stolen, sir.<eos> You have a security problem, Dr. Goodman.<eos> And when I find out who did this, you may have a murder problem.<eos> But I'm on top of it, okay?<eos> You didn't have to come down here, sir.<eos> That's what I thought, until I got a call from someone at the Department of Defense.<eos> Defense?<eos> How do they figure into a murder investigation?<eos> Branson Rose, he has friends in high places, and they don't like it when the guy who builds their bombers is unhappy.
I have to give you credit, Smallville.<eos> Who would've known you'd be such a natural with kids?<eos> Well, Maddie's pretty special.<eos> So, what happens to her now?<eos> Can't be easy finding a family willing to live without windows.<eos> She gonna live with her grandmother, who couldn't be happier.<eos> She didn't even know she had a granddaughter.<eos> Wow, she must be pretty brave.<eos> She's excited. Like my parents when they adopted me.<eos> They didn't worry about their house getting destroyed.
The brothers like to be hands-on.<eos> And all we're hearing is them bitching about how somebody snatched their M.O... as if it's copyrighted.<eos> Based on my dissection,<eos> I've detected two separate events.<eos> I believe that this puncture wound happened first.<eos> The object lacerated a cerebral artery creating a subdural hematoma.<eos> Then subsequent blows to her skull, from a ride behind the car, created additional fractures which caused diffuse bleeding on the brain, resulting in her death.<eos> So punctured and bobbled?<eos> I autopsied the Fatellis' original victim.<eos> They're sadists.
- "It's not a big deal"?<eos> Okay!<eos> - It's not that far away.<eos> - Right. Oh,it's not that far away?<eos> - Dude, it- - Whatever,okay?<eos> You didn't even care to tell me before?<eos> Bye.<eos> Justin, what happened?<eos> Andrew just told me he's moving in with his grandparents.<eos> They live so far away, I'm never gonna see him anymore.
Suburbia is in a lot of trouble because the whole model of suburbia is you commute 30, 40, 50 miles to your job and back.<eos> And that's only viable so long as you've got relatively cheap oil and gas.<eos> It's not just that the country is spread out, we've evolved our cities for the use of cars. The cities will have to be rebuilt from scratch practically to have more efficient and usable public transportation. This is quite different from the cities in Europe which were already basically in place before the car was invented.<eos> So, yes, it's going to be a terrible blow to the United States when we no longer have the oil that we love so much.<eos> What we avoided so long and the three things that we need are now in very short supply.<eos> One of them is money and in our country we don't worry about money, we just borrow it from our kids and our grandkids and accumulating a debt.<eos> But the other two things we can't borrow from our kids and our grandkids, and that's time and energy.<eos> In order to make energy available to invest and buy time we have to have a very vigorous conservation program.<eos> Since the US uses the fourth of all the world's oil, we clearly need to lead there.<eos> I believe that our American people have a great spirit of entrepeneurship and patriotism, if they really knew what the problem was, that they would be very responsive in doing what I think are the necessary things to get ourselves to the other side with as few bumps as possible.
You passed out. What?<eos> Mikey fell. Has your wife had a seizure before?<eos> No.<eos> Tonight. L Word marathon.<eos> You watch The L Word?<eos> On mute.<eos> I'll pass.<eos> Dinner with Cuddy.<eos> Still sucking up so she'll fund your play space for the chemo kids?<eos> They really ought to save their energy for other things, like crying.
Coach, we're in this together.<eos> It's what you taught us, right?<eos> I'm afraid that's a forfeit, Ref.<eos> Okay, the Ravens forfeit.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, it looks like the Ravens are gonna forfeit the game. Ravens forfeit.<eos> You guys didn't have to forfeit the game. You didn't have to do that for me.<eos> Hey, I told you, got your back.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Look, here's the thing...<eos> All these guys, Luke, they'd walk through fire for you.
So you put it on the net.<eos> I never said that, but things happen.<eos> Did Hi-Def and Dollar have a beef before this?<eos> Yeah, a couple of years ago, Dollar did song called "New Vegas".<eos> Talking about how Las Vegas is the new New York.<eos> Hi-Def is New York.<eos> He and Dollar been punking each other ever since.<eos> What's the deal with these street teams.<eos> What's going on?<eos> They do all the filthy, dirty, grimy promo for Dollar.
Okay, look, i'm dying, all right?<eos> - What?<eos> - I'm dying.<eos> I have stage iv lymphoma, and i'll be lucky to make it through the semester.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> Do i sound like i'm kidding?<eos> That's horrible.<eos> It's reality.<eos> So for as long as i am here, i want to bring something positive from my experience to these kids.<eos> They're gonna lose me, and i want them to understand why.
Oh, yes, I do.<eos> Terrence Bock is going to win.<eos> You looking for me?<eos> Yeah4,.<eos> Lee. Come on in.<eos> What's up?<eos> You making any progress identifying those three mules that died the other night?<eos> Surprise, surprise.<eos> Their fingerprints and DNA don't match anything we had on file.<eos> We reached out to the appropriate foreign governments, and they contacted their law enforcement agencies, but it's going to be a while before anyone gets back to us.
I thought to remain in America but I'm back.<eos> Do not ask me why.<eos> Nobody knows who that Carmen is .<eos> She lives on the other side of the world. Carmen<eos> - I do not care.<eos> - What is the problem?<eos> I understand.<eos> - In what sense?<eos> That men are ungrateful, capricious, unfair and selfish?<eos> And they are the strongest.
- Oil?<eos> Oil, sure.<eos> But the commodity we like best is risk.<eos> - How much risk?<eos> - As much as we can get.<eos> Then, gentlemen, I think I may be able to help you.<eos> Hang on.<eos> So the shares can't be traded until after the flotation, right?<eos> Yeah, investors can only subscribe to the shares now.<eos> They don't actually get their certificates until after we're officially quoted on the stock market.
- No, only indirectly.<eos> Also, your Mom lives on in you.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Where do you think you got the mark on your nose from?<eos> I don't know.<eos> And what is it called?<eos> Birth mark/Mother's mark.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> You have the genes of your mother.<eos> And when you have children, they will also have the genes of your mother.
This train goes express after midnight, it doesn't even stop here.<eos> He picked this spot beforehand.<eos> His last fare was logged at an address on Church Street.<eos> Do you have any idea what's there? Church is an entry point from Brooklyn.<eos> There's a dive there where the cabbies stop for coffee before the overnight shift.<eos> Explains how he got a cab.<eos> This guy is definitely not disorganized.<eos> Rachel Holman's change-of-address card.<eos> She'd just moved in.<eos> Hadn't even filled it out yet. So she probably didn't know her neighbors and they weren't likely to check in on her.
She had an informant who linked these guys to an Aryan motorcycle gang:<eos> the Outlaw Renegades.<eos> It's run by a guy named Roy Mitchell.<eos> Looks like she put surveillance on the gang based on information from the informant.<eos> Anything come of it?<eos> Her team spotted the Outlaw Renegades outside a bank, then ATF waited on these guys.<eos> How come there were no arrests made?<eos> They never went inside the bank.<eos> Someone tipped these guys off.<eos> Right, they knew they were being watched, that's why they didn't go inside.
I want to play another game.<eos> Hello again, Lionel.<eos> Where am I?<eos> In a hell of your own making.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Just another one of the many faceless people your greed has destroyed.<eos> That narrows it down some, doesn't it?<eos> You may not know me, Lionel but I know you.<eos> You're a man above it all commanding your workers to carry the burden of your empire.<eos> They toil while you profit.
Couple felonies.<eos> This list is like a confession.<eos> I guess it is.<eos> But one by one, I'm crossing them off, and one day I'll have a better life.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm arresting you.<eos> But you're gonna be a pro bowler.<eos> Bowlers don't arrest people.<eos> They bowl.<eos> They bowl and people cheer.
I was at Alphonse's last night.<eos> My boyfriend.<eos> I went straight to work from his house.<eos> - I don't believe it.<eos> - She appears to be telling the truth.<eos> No, I mean the part about her having a boyfriend.<eos> Come on.<eos> I need his number and address.<eos> I'd appreciate it if you kept this quiet, Agent Gibbs.<eos> My parents... they still think I'm a virgin.
Oh,come on,in this case, I doubt it.<eos> But without a name or a paper trail, we got no way of getting to him.<eos> So once again we have nothing.<eos> I wouldn't exactly call a two-week stay nothing,okay?<eos> It's more than we had yesterday.<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> Do you really ever think that you're going to get to the bottom of this?<eos> That they'll let you get to the bottom of this?<eos> These guys don't exist.<eos> You go after them with the law, and they'll just use it against you.
In 1987, I was "people" magazine's "sexiest man alive".<eos> I made a lot of money chasing people around with my shirt unbuttoned. If I wanted to do a movie, the movie got made.<eos> Then I got older.<eos> I started getting cast as the father of superstar tweens who have no idea of who I am.<eos> It's a new age.<eos> They're the ones who are getting movies made today.
- Not even me you kiss, you only throw and you want him to violate you.<eos> This well.<eos> .Esta well?<eos> .Quieres that violates you?<eos> I will kiss you a little.<eos> And take off the gloves.<eos> You need points for that<eos> It doesn't hurt a lot.<eos> Does .Ahora want to kiss me?<eos> - Some murderers in series uses objects when they want to kill, you already know, as bottles, knives...
They deal drugs, run guns.<eos> They also hire themselves out as hit men.<eos> Which is what 2 of their members were allegedly doing a year ago, when they mistakenly shot a Private First Class...<eos> Martin Reggie.<eos> A Marine from First Sergeant Downing's Company.<eos> - We couldn't prove it.<eos> - Downing was on a revenge mission.<eos> First Sergeants don't go on revenge missions, Officer David.<eos> I would. Why not a Marine First Sergeant?<eos> They have more control than you do.
It just hit me.<eos> "Sweet *** *** ***"<eos> And we can get away with that too because it's cable.<eos> You can't get there without the fans, right.<eos> I have to thank them.<eos> I've got to thank specifically the ones... oh, god, what's it called?<eos> Have you seen the site?<eos> I mean, it's insane. Apparently they get dozens of hits a month, whatever I think that's a lot.<eos> But between them and the ad in Variety that they put out, I'm pretty sure that went a long way towards convincing the producers to take me back... have me... to invite me back.<eos> It wasn't their decision you know, they called, said, "do you want it?" You know, and I was ready.
I didn't mean to spoil the ending for you.<eos> You should keep reading though.<eos> You shouldn't run full out like that.<eos> There's wheel ruts and prairie dog holes.<eos> You shouldn't worry about me.<eos> I'm a very accomplished rider.<eos> I was worried about him.<eos> How's your father and mother?<eos> Oh, they're-<eos> - They're not my parents.
You can't prove that I killed anybody because I didn't kill anybody.<eos> And if you're not going to charge me, I'm going to leave.<eos> I want to see my wife's body now!<eos> Well, I pushed the guy as hard as I could, but there's a lot of media heat on this one. I had to cut him loose.<eos> Well, he's got a bullet wound and a dead wife.<eos> For now, the evidence says he's a victim.<eos> Well, that's what I told the unit who's shadowing him.<eos> Sunstar cabs.<eos> Yeah, we had several pickups from that office park this morning, but, uh, look, those drivers are all off right now, and they take one look at my caller ID,<eos> They ain't picking' up.
Uh... 58 seconds.<eos> Charles, what is it?<eos> I need to talk to Don.<eos> We searched that storage locker that Justin Price rented. Found some unused ammo.<eos> But if he was storing guns there once, they're not there now.<eos> We did find this.<eos> Take a look.<eos> It's a security schedule.<eos> Yeah. It shows that the metal detectors were down at the southeast entrance of the school the morning of the shooting.<eos> All right, so they knew exactly where to enter.
Now you say another one of my kids is involved?<eos> Where does this end?<eos> I think as soon as we find this third gunman.<eos> I wanted to reopen school, get the kids back to some kind of normal routine.<eos> I can see now that's not possible. Mr. Northrup, right now we need your cooperation.<eos> We need the files of everyone associated with the DMG.<eos> That might be a problem.<eos> What do you mean? Why?<eos> Well, the parents of these children feel their kids are being unfairly singled out.<eos> They've hired lawyers and they make it clear that they won't consent.
You know what?<eos> I think it is time for Sandy and Kirsten to know their son a little better.<eos> What?<eos> Summer, you can't do that.<eos> Oh, I can.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> He told me that if he screwed up, I could show this to his parents.<eos> Revenge.<eos> Don't you think that maybe he's telling the truth about him and Anna?<eos> I mean, do you really think that they would do that to you?
The hell's going on now?<eos> Shh, quiet students, quiet!<eos> Once again, we have just learn that the Family Guy episode featuring Muhammed, was only part one of a two-parter!<eos> And part two is going to air next week, with Muhammed uncensored!<eos> What?<eos> - Why would they...<eos> - Fox studios claim that the Family Guy writing staff has demanded the Muhammed character be seen in full-view.<eos> The head of Fox had this to say.<eos> Family Guy is our biggest show.<eos> If they insist we don't censor their work, then we can't.
I called Park Services, they went looking for a girl disabled by a fall, never found her.<eos> Hold on.<eos> You guys know more about this than I do.<eos> She was sexually assaulted and strangled?<eos> According to the girls we spoke to over at the sorority, she was sent to paint Skull Rockas an initiation task.<eos> She left her housearound 4:30 this morning so she could do it without being spotted by the park rangers.<eos> Okay.<eos> I had my dream right after sunrise.<eos> Based on some very preliminary work, the folks over at forensics are saying it looks like she fell, she broke her left ankle and then was dragged to where your husband found her.<eos> They believe that's where she was sodomized, raped and then eventually, strangled to death.
That girl you called me about a couple hours ago, you said she was drivinga silver sedan?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> I think we found the car.<eos> Trucker called it in last night.<eos> Looks like it just ran out of gas on the side of the desert highway about 40 miles outside the city.<eos> What about the girl?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, we found her, too.<eos> We're still waiting to hear from forensics.<eos> They think that he offered her a ride, raped her and then strangled her.
- Get Keturah.<eos> I'm here.<eos> Unhand him now.<eos> I will not free you.<eos> These men will kill your friends first.<eos> I don't think that'Il be necessary.<eos> Why don't we all put our weapons down and talk about this nicely ?<eos> Let them go.<eos> It's me the Wraith want.<eos> They had nothing to do with what happened.
"Don't worry, dear. Hardly anyone uses the term 'bastard' anymore."<eos> Or, "I would have thought a girl like you would have had a purse full of condoms."<eos> Those come way too easy for you.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm not going.<eos> We have to go.<eos> My parents are officially back together. Since my father broke off his affair with Tina, they want to celebrate it.<eos> Fine. Then we'll just talk about that.<eos> I said celebrate it, not acknowledge it.<eos> As far as they're concerned, it never happened.
Well, shall we move to the living room for dessert then?<eos> Good night buddy.<eos> Relax.<eos> Look, I'm sorry about dinner.<eos> Even though I was born blind, I've never had a problem seeing.<eos> I see with earthbending. It's kind of like seeing with my feet.<eos> I feel the vibrations in the earth, and I can see where everything is.<eos> You, that tree, even those ants.<eos> That's amazing.<eos> My parents don't understand. They've always treated me like I was helpless.

They've always treated me like I was helpless.<eos> Is that why you became The Blind Bandit?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Then why stay here where you're not happy?<eos> They're my parents. Where else am I supposed to go?
No sir, none of us did.<eos> Then why are they refusing to write?<eos> I agreed to show Mohammed uncensored!<eos> I did what you asked!<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> !<eos> Sir! Sir!<eos> If you don't my saying, I think you asked for this.<eos> You gave in to the manatees last week.<eos> Now they know all they have to do is refuse to work and they can get whatever they want.
- Do you know what I think the problem is?<eos> You're fighting the process.<eos> In the end, all you're really doing is delaying the inevitable.<eos> Why don't we try and keep an open mind?<eos> All five teams are in position.<eos> You have a go.<eos> Who was that?<eos> Turn it down.<eos> Damn.<eos> Maybe they'll have better luck at the other locations.
Those were individual nanites, easy to disrupt with a simple EM pulse.<eos> These things have evolved way beyond that, with interdependent organic constituents of a far greater complexity.<eos> - Are you feeling better?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Follow me.<eos> I have an offer to make you, something that could greatly benefit us both.<eos> Well, if the offer involves saving Atlantis, we're willing to listen.<eos> It does.<eos> We have achieved much since our second birth.<eos> We have evolved to take the form of our creators, built a city far grander than they ever achieved. Yet, for all this, we are still restricted from reaching a pivotal point in our evolution.
I'm here now.<eos> It was nice.<eos> Logan looked great- very dignified.<eos> He didn't trip.<eos> He remembered to wear pants.<eos> He's quite a catch, that guy.<eos> I was very proud of him.<eos> I'm just waiting for him to extricate himself from those people.<eos> Oh, his parents are there, huh?<eos> Yep, they are with Logan, and I am standing a good 50 feet away.
Look, I know it's only December 1st, but I have all the planning to do for the Winterfest.<eos> You have a cookbook to write, the kids have school.<eos> It all goes by so quickly.<eos> Before you know it, Christmas will be over.<eos> That doesn't mean we have to plan every second.<eos> Look, my dad dragged me from one air force base to another.<eos> Christmas was not a priority for him.<eos> We didn't even have a tree.<eos> I want things to be different for my kids.<eos> I want them to have big family traditions year after year that they can count on and look forward to.
I want things to be different for my kids.<eos> I want them to have big family traditions year after year that they can count on and look forward to.<eos> You're right.<eos> - I'm gonna try to be more supportive.<eos> - Well, you should be.<eos> Madison is a loner.<eos> She has hardly any friends.<eos> Carter's a ten-year-old boy with a midlife crisis.<eos> Let's face it, our kids are a little weird.<eos> This year they need Christmas more than ever.
Come back here.<eos> We're not done with rehearsal.<eos> Come back.<eos> We're going caroling. It's a tradition.<eos> Everybody...<eos> Honey.<eos> You!<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Where are the kids?<eos> Oh, look. They're going to be making kissing and so.
Don't think about it.<eos> Feel it.<eos> I felt it.<eos> Now you have become a Yin warrior.<eos> I think you guys need this.<eos> Come on, Shen.<eos> Let's celebrate with your first cappuccino.<eos> I don't know what that is but I hope it's chocolate.<eos> I just hope when the monks leave their bodies my teachers won't remember anything and hold it against me.<eos> Don't worry, they won't.

Please tell me it's not during homecoming.<eos> - I'm gonna go get another one of these.<eos> - Get back here.<eos> You knew the whole time that it was gonna happen during homecoming, didn't you?<eos> - Why didn't you tell me?<eos> - I was afraid you wouldn't train.<eos> So you lied to me instead.<eos> - Monks don't lie.<eos> - No.<eos> They just don't tell the truth.
Even here, things are blocked.<eos> Then, leave!<eos> Go to Latin America!<eos> Things are happening there.<eos> What about you?<eos> I'll come along!<eos> You'd come?<eos> Yes.<eos> And the kids?<eos> They'll be fine.
Then, leave!<eos> Go to Latin America!<eos> Things are happening there.<eos> What about you?<eos> I'll come along!<eos> You'd come?<eos> Yes.<eos> And the kids?<eos> They'll be fine.<eos> They've spent two weeks alone with Filomena before.
A fox got caught in this trap.<eos> To be free, it gnawed off its paw.<eos> We're taking all this to the presbytery?<eos> First we'll ask our help if they want any of it.<eos> The presbytery gives it to orphans and the poor?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> We've done this before.<eos> Granny, do you think farmers should share fields among those who have lots and those who have less?<eos> Those are the ideas of your parents.<eos> You think they're Communists?
- What do you do during Bible study?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Don't you miss it?<eos> - No.<eos> What do you do with God, Jesus and the Virgin Mary?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I know why she skips Bible study.<eos> Her parents have become "beatnik-hippy".<eos> They don't have a big house anymore.<eos> They live in a tiny crowded place, and they eat weird food.
Yes!<eos> No!<eos> Yes!<eos> No!<eos> Yes!<eos> What's a "beatnik-hippy"?<eos> I don't know.<eos> So how are babies made?<eos> Your parents never told you?<eos> When I ask, they pretend not to hear me.
Oh, I'm sorry, princess.<eos> I was looking for my friend Haley.<eos> Wow, did it really take all this stuff to make you look like this? No!<eos> Everybody got ready in here, including Rachel and Brooke, for some reason. - Hi.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Wow.<eos> You really look beautiful.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So your parents really aren't coming?<eos> No, they...
I know where he is, I'm just not supposed to tell you.<eos> The thing is, Alan does a lot of charity work.<eos> -Really?<eos> -Oh, yeah.<eos> Right now he's down at the nursing home giving sponge baths to old people.<eos> They don't go out a lot so they tend to get dusty.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> In fact, just the other night he was down on skid row teaching salsa dancing to crack addicts.<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> They have the energy, they just lack the focus.
We both like brussels sprouts.<eos> You don't like brussels sprouts.<eos> A man can change, Zack.<eos> What, a human tooth?<eos> Yeah, it was some kind of...some flesh, some fabric; it looked like some kind of shell.<eos> Yeah, sounds like to make you forget.<eos> Somebody doesn't want you to know what happened to John Doe 361.<eos> Booth, I'm not under a spell.<eos> Well, you forgot a whole day.<eos> The spirits don't need you to believe in them, Dr. Brennan; they believe in you.
Bones, you up there?<eos> Come on, let's go, huh?<eos> I found the agent that was assigned to your parents' case.<eos> I was the FBI liaison on a bank robbery task force working out of Cincinnati in the mid- to late-seventies.<eos> Secret service, state police, ATF, all of us after a pretty bad bunch of armed robbers working Ohio, Kentucky, Iowa.<eos> You know, excuse me.<eos> Am I to understand that I'm addressing the family of one of these robbers?<eos> Max and Ruth Keenan's children.<eos> Max and Ruth.<eos> Yeah. They never really belonged in that crew.
And then? Talk to her again as a cop.<eos> I like you, you're ruthless.<eos> Take a look.<eos> It's from the courthouse employees' database.<eos> Alan Parker, the janitor at the courthouse.<eos> That's their inside man.<eos> You have to understand, okay.<eos> They threatened me. A bailiff was killed as a result of your actions.<eos> And that's so far; there's still two dangerous killers out there.<eos> They knew my daughters' names.
It's either this or go back to china.<eos> No to baby!<eos> No!<eos> had to push the dusting, didn't you?<eos> peter,I don't think i'm being unreasonable here.<eos> It's not like I'gonna advertise my addiction history, but if your kids ask a direct question, I'm not gonna lie to them.<eos> Right! Uh-huh.<eos> Good point.<eos> listen,I don't expect you to lie about the alcoholism.<eos> I mean,they know that's how we met.
- Sure, I do.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> Real depression affects you physically.<eos> You literally can't get out of bed.<eos> There's a weight pressing down on you all the time.<eos> You don't care if you eat, if you stink- It's all too much.<eos> And Ryan had it.<eos> I told him to talk to his parents.<eos> They told him to study harder and play sports after school.<eos> Ryan was drowning, and they couldn't see it.
- And so are you, honey.<eos> Come on!<eos> Yes, thank you, gentlemen. Take a seat.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Please, doctor, I assure you, this will be very brief.<eos> I'm sorry your husband isn't with us tonight.<eos> - I wanna see my kids.<eos> - You will.<eos> Why was I taken from them?<eos> 'Cause they don't belong with you anymore.
I just...<eos> I just wouldn't go over there if I were you guys.<eos> I just took a huge dump.<eos> Aw, dude!<eos> The cave-in was massive.<eos> It has cut off all access in or out.<eos> The children are believe to be trapped somewhere in this area.<eos> Does anybody know who these kids are?<eos> No, nobody seems to knew them.<eos> Only that they were in the tour group.
See you around.<eos> Why won't anybody listen to me? !<eos> ManBearPig is in there and we have to kill him while we all have the chance.<eos> I'm serial!<eos> Mr. Gore, please, we need you to calm down.<eos> Now, what exactly do you suggest we do?<eos> I told you we need to fill the cave with hot molten lead, 'cause it's the only way to make sure ManBearPig never comes out!<eos> And I'm sane and I'm totally serial, but everyone just keeps digging!<eos> Well, see, the problen is that if we fill the caves with hot molten lead, it will kill those boys too.<eos> They're already dead!

Dude, he's really sick.<eos> It's been three days since four unidentified children were trapped in a cave-in.<eos> Three days without food and time is certainly running out.<eos> The digging continues, but progress is fatally slow.<eos> All right, people, we've gotta work faster!<eos> Our best estimate still puts us three days from reaching the area of the cave called "Smuggler's Den".<eos> Smuggler's Den?<eos> It's a room near the end of the tour where you can get your picture taken with fake treasure.<eos> Here, see?<eos> Based on where the boys were seen last, they're somewhere near this area!
For ManBearPig is no more.<eos> Oh Jesus, here we go again.<eos> I have beaten ManBearPig and we will never forget the names of the brave young kids who lost their lives.<eos> Kid 1<eos> Kid 2<eos> Kid 3 and of course<eos> Kid 4. I remember how Kid 1 used to laugh and play.<eos> And how Kid 2 was always there when I needed him.<eos> Kid 4 was filled with hope It's the kids!<eos> - They're alive!
Great men, rich men.<eos> - It's insane.<eos> - It's consensual validation, Kevin.<eos> The urge to conform.<eos> What seems insane to us is completely logical to the group.<eos> Where does he find these nutters?<eos> That's just it, see?<eos> They're not nutters, Kevin!<eos> Not to begin with.<eos> No, they're just, just ordinary people.

Jim does the best impressions.<eos> Sometimes he'll look up at me from his desk, and he'll just be someone else.<eos> Like, he'll go...<eos> That's supposed to be Phyllis.<eos> I can't do it as good as he can.<eos> And the guys are saying, "Chug!<eos> Chug! Chug!"<eos> But I'm so small and all I had eaten that day was one of those Auntie Em pretzels from the food court.<eos> So I said, "Is it okay if I sip it?"<eos> And they said, "No. " But Ryan seemed cool either way...
We joined the gang together.<eos> Spare his life.<eos> It's not like I have a choice.<eos> I wish I were you.<eos> It's your move.<eos> Oh crap!<eos> Boss Fay ordered the hit.<eos> Boss Fay, this is Sergeant Shan.<eos> I bumped into your men.<eos> What they do is not my business.
Guy of Gisborne runs your estate for the Sheriff.<eos> Does he?<eos> We have one tithe after another for the King in the Holy Land.<eos> Making ends meet... It was wrong, but my boys, they took some game.<eos> I went to stop them, but so did Gisborne's lot.<eos> They got caught.<eos> Me too.<eos> Someone had to lose a hand.<eos> Better me than Will, or little Lukey.<eos> I'm old. They've got years ahead of them.
Don't think she was.<eos> Couldn't see her boys starve.<eos> The whole village has suffered. Not just us.<eos> Jane, your good strong wife...<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on, stand there and don't move!<eos> Ten sacks of flour have gone missing from the store.<eos> They will be found.<eos> Go on, get out of here with the rest of 'em.<eos> They will be accounted for.
And there's some paint chips in the kitchen if you want to go look.<eos> Oh, is this going to be a permanent fixture?<eos> Well, I worked really hard on that.<eos> It seems like you and Marissa are on good terms now.<eos> Yeah, figures.<eos> Just as she's about to set sail.<eos> It's pretty cool that you're letting her go.<eos> It's pretty cool that you came back so she can leave.<eos> Well, I don't love Marissa that much.<eos> It's just, all the older kids, they just see me as Marissa's little sister, and they've graduated.
That you've managed to be walking around all this time is nothing short of a miracle.<eos> I'd say about two months.<eos> Okay, all right, time for the big announcement.<eos> Everyone, Ricardo and I are getting married!<eos> Oh, that is terrific!<eos> It's about time you two settled down.<eos> Oh, you hear that, Meg?<eos> Guys can marry other guys now.<eos> So... um... this is awkward, but, uh...<eos> I mean, if they can do that, that's pretty much it for you, isn't it?
And, hey, you've distracted everyone from the Dig 'Em statue, so I guess we don't need this bill anymore.<eos> Evera-bodah ha-ppy!<eos> Well, it sure was nice of Mayor West to drop the kidnapping charges.<eos> Amazing.<eos> All he asked for in return was the key to a Volkswagen Scirocco.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Listen, Lois, I... I really appreciate you putting your discomfort aside, so we can have the wedding here.<eos> Please, I'm over all that now.<eos> Two men getting married doesn't bother me in the least.<eos> They deserve happiness.
Those guys pay me crazy loot.<eos> You think I'm gonna give that up?<eos> - You're gonna have to.<eos> - Why?<eos> It's my money.<eos> I earned it.<eos> It's obvious that Teddy is the victim here.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> He's being exploited.<eos> You arrest the men who pay for this. They're the problem.
Got to go.<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> Guv!<eos> Tony?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> It's my dream.<eos> It's about letting go.<eos> Is it the tumors?<eos> They've come back.<eos> They wouldn't tell me.
So here I am in Algeria.<eos> STARNAUD<eos> - A FRENCH TOWN<eos> Master-Sgt Schmelk.<eos> Welcome, Lt.<eos> I'll escort you.<eos> Here, you even go piss at the double.<eos> Colonel's orders!<eos> "Keeps the men in a fighting mood."<eos> They're in a permanent state of alert.
Supposedly they were saying I was crazy, and they was filling you up with Ritalin and drugs and all this stuff.<eos> But there wasn't nothing wrong with me, you know what I'm saying?<eos> The psychiatrist just said,<eos> "This guy is looking for something more in this life.<eos> There's something missing."<eos> So he contacted the American Embassy, who found my mother, and they sent a letter to her and asked her, did she want me to come live with her?<eos> And I got on the plane a couple weeks later.<eos> - I felt like I was a failure, you know, that I didn't do what I was supposed to do for him and all of that, you know?<eos> But when I looked back as time went on, I realized that, you know, it was-it was better for him.<eos> - I want to see Chris be an example, particularly kids who are institutionalized, so they, too, can have something to work towards, because they can see success at the end.
Get away from him!<eos> Spears? I'm afraid you'll have to do better than that.<eos> Or not.<eos> Well, that's embarrassing.<eos> End this fighting now!<eos> I said stop!<eos> It is I who allowed these outsiders to be here.<eos> Hank's been poisoned!<eos> I will provide him with an antidote, but only if you leave here now.<eos> And if you return, they will kill you.
Just now.<eos> He died a minute ago.<eos> - How?<eos> By eating a chocolate.<eos> Why are you eating my brain!<eos> Bunty is not here, who are these strange people?<eos> Boss, these guys know where bunty is!<eos> He is my boss!<eos> Gullu, save me from them!<eos> Boss, they are addressing him as boss.
WEIR: Abdul Jawad is a Palestinian farmer whose family has lived there and tended the land for centuries. The Israeli authorities have confiscated countless acres of their farmland.<eos> These settlers live and prosper at the expense of the Palestinians, and the Palestinians' well-being, present well-being and future well-being.<eos> And they don't see this horrible, disproportionate allocation of resources where Jewish settlers get water and electricity and gas, garbage pickup, all kinds of things that their Palestinian neighbors don't get, because of the military occupation.<eos> KAMPHOEFNER: They lost the middle of the valley for a bypass road which is now an Israeli-only bypass road. They can't drive on it to go to their homes.<eos> CHOMSKY: The thing is extremely ugly to watch.<eos> This is just day to day life. I'm not talking about the fighting here.<eos> I mean, you walk through Hebron; you've got an Arab city; 100,000 Arabs;<eos> The settlers can go in a Palestinian village and burn the fields there, destroy the house, hit Palestinians, even shoot Palestinians.<eos> Several of the women have been beaten by settlers on different occasions.<eos> And they just attacked different ones of us.
How can anybody believe that there is going to be the creation of a real state?<eos> It's a symbol and a reality of oppression.<eos> Anybody outside of Israel who supports a two-state solution has to be very careful because what they mean in a two-state solution is that 90 percent of historical Palestine will be Israel.<eos> In the remaining 10 percent, you'll have two huge prison camps. One in the Gaza Strip and one in the West Bank.<eos> The people who fought in the war were also the people who wrote the history books of the war.<eos> And they already had the story that they made up about what had really happened. And that story was integrated in the Israeli education system. It was integrated in the media, in the political discourse.<eos> Some of us who work as Jewish educators have been admitting, over the last maybe ten years, that it is propaganda.<eos> KHALIDl: Israelis don't understand what's going on. They don't know the occupation.<eos> We began to educate ourselves. And the first thing we did was invite women, Palestinian women, to come into our homes and talk to us, and tell us what exactly was the problem, as they saw it.<eos> And little by little, we learned about their lives. We learned about the suffering they encountered on a daily basis. We learned about the killing going on there, about the lives that were completely circumscribed by an occupation that they had no control over.
He respects my boundaries.<eos> Well, you better give that boy a reason to stick around, or he's gonna find a girl with looser boundaries.<eos> Erik would never do that.<eos> Yeah, that's what you said about Trent.<eos> He broke up with you over sex, and that was sophomore year.<eos> Yeah, this just isn't gonna work without the sex.<eos> God, Trent is cute, and I heard he just broke up with Holly.<eos> Look, Tracy, we love you, and we love Erik, but let's get real.<eos> He's a guy, and guys have certain needs.<eos> They really do.
Stifler?<eos> Mmm?<eos> Can you play?<eos> Don't ever ask if Stifler can play.<eos> I'm good.<eos> The team we're playing's been undefeated five straight years.<eos> These guys must be pretty serious.<eos> Fucking-A-right, they're serious.<eos> Lambda Pi Gamma.<eos> They're our arch rivals in everything:
Fucking-A-right, they're serious.<eos> Lambda Pi Gamma.<eos> They're our arch rivals in everything:<eos> Sports, women, booze.<eos> These guys are fucking evil.<eos> Get ready!<eos> Come on!<eos> Down!<eos> Blue 42.<eos> They're midgets.
Much depends on his success.<eos> Our friend?<eos> The red one.<eos> OK, didn't want to assume.<eos> Two demons, sons of the storm, seek entrance to this world.<eos> They are Thunder and Lightning.<eos> Their spirits are already here.<eos> These storms.<eos> But the storms are nothing.<eos> Once they walk the earth, the demons will wake their brothers, the dragons.

Running all over the city.<eos> Trying to make sure that good men like my crew here aren't rubbing one off on the city's dime, huh?<eos> I'm just doing what I'm told.<eos> yeah, and there's a lot of honor in that. Ain't there, flynn?<eos> You take your little clipboard, you go on downtown back to headquarters and you tell whoever it was that sent you up here that they can kiss my white Irish ass.<eos> This is the bravest bunch of guys I've ever had the honor of serving with.<eos> These guys are gold when it comes to saving people's lives and protecting their property, not to mention the 5 names on the plaque on that wall out there.<eos> Guys that went into those 2 towers on that day and never came back.<eos> So, if within the sacred confines of these 4 walls makes you want to look at something else other than that shit, that's fine with me.<eos> They want to smoke, they want to jerk off, they want to shove potato chips up their ass, I don't give a shit, as long as they keep getting on that rig and going out the door and saving lives, I'll back 'em up.
Oh, my God, Maia.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - Oh, my God. - Diana, what happened?<eos> She was kidnapped, Tom.<eos> She was taken by a woman pretending to be her sister.<eos> She took Maia, Tyler Downing, Lindsey Hammond, and a whole bunch of 4400 kids.<eos> Do you remember any of this?<eos> No. No, I don't.<eos> So this woman took these children and somehow made everyone forget they ever existed.<eos> Yes, but they existed.
My wife knew I loved to fly.<eos> She encouraged it.<eos> I - I just flew out to Camden Island and back.<eos> Right,the over water flight on the wife's birthday.<eos> You'd have to be an idiot to think people would believe that.<eos> Or exceedingly smart.<eos> To know that they won't,but say it anyway.<eos> What?<eos> See,good liars... They lead you down a road, carefully planting various signs, until you're in exactly the place that they want you.<eos> Then they can tell you anything that they want... and you'll believe it.
That girl is pathological.<eos> Mm-hmm,which puts her in group three.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> Your latest theory?<eos> Okay-healthy people, for the most part,tell the truth.<eos> When they lie,it's usually for socially acceptable reasons, to spare someone's feelings or avoid embarrassment.<eos> That's group one.<eos> Okay. What's number two?<eos> That would be your garden variety liars.<eos> They're the type that embellish accomplishments, cheat on their spouses, stab colleagues in the back to climb the corporate ladder.
Yeah,I know.<eos> But were the dentist bills so high that you had to kill her?<eos> You've been watching too much bad TV,honey.<eos> We're businessmen.<eos> Honest ones.<eos> Not like those crooks on Wall Street.<eos> You got me there.<eos> So what does Andy have to say about all this?<eos> Andy says the old lady kept the books.<eos> They show she paid.
And the 2nd one is Pandu.<eos> police will faint if they look at him.<eos> Pandu has bullets in his pocket just like we have peppermints.<eos> Anyway, your sister is very tough.<eos> She made the police the mafia come after her.<eos> May be it is fortight security.<eos> Get up Shruthi have breakfast.<eos> The tourist spot GoIconda is floating in blood.<eos> 10 bodies were found there.<eos> police say that they all are rowdies.
Shit, where did they go?<eos> They're for real.<eos> They must be going to get the drugs.<eos> Let's toast.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Seven or eight years.<eos> That's the average life cycle for guys like you.<eos> Make a little money get cocky, land in jail.<eos> Then get out and binge.<eos> They get pissed because they don't get respect anymore.
My coin came up tails each time.<eos> Both kids have it.<eos> Did it make you waver at all in your decision when you found out that they had electrodact...<eos> -Ectrodactyly.<eos> -Sorry.<eos> I know.<eos> Clumsy word, hard to pronounce.<eos> But it's a hell of a lot better than Lobster Claw Syndrome!<eos> Yeah, I wavered.<eos> But ultimately, I decided they had every right to be here and be different.
No. No, Amy Bennett.<eos> Why would I say Tommy?<eos> Anyway, I,ve never felt that way before and I haven't since.<eos> Just three words of advice: Hall Oates.<eos> Chicks dig,em.<eos> Okay, campers, time for the swim tests, so just jump right in.<eos> We never go in the water.<eos> It is too close to the Bawango rebel camp.<eos> Ah, yes. The rich kids, camp. No.<eos> They are the ones who destroyed our village and forced us here. Mm-hmm. Our old rivals.
Help... help...<eos> Fujita?<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> It's ok, thanks for trying to help.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Why?<eos> You made me cool down a bit.<eos> You're the only one who tried to remove it.<eos> Why didn't you ask your friends?<eos> They're not my friends, I just hang with them.
Trust me, Francine.<eos> Steve's not going anywhere.<eos> All he has is the shirt on his back and the $1,600 I gave him to pay this quarter's kid tax.<eos> By the way, can you believe this kid tax?<eos> Bueno.<eos> Muchas gracias, Toshi.<eos> None of Steve's friends have seen him.<eos> I should have never let them leave.<eos> What if they really did go to New York?<eos> Francine, they're not in New York.
Come on, guys, tell me, I'm not gonna fucking scoop you!<eos> Tell me!<eos> I figured that part out long ago.<eos> With everything I saw in their lab, their idea makes perfect sense.<eos> Actually, it makes perfect brilliant sense.<eos> I can see why they weren't keen to share.<eos> I know plenty of scientists who would scoop them in a second.<eos> Are you satisfied with this?<eos> It's not a question of my own satisfaction.<eos> They missed it, Vincent.
You're going to suffocate to death.<eos> I've seen you run many times rom upstairs.<eos> It's as if you want to set a new world record every time.<eos> And you look like you're being chased.<eos> I do?<eos> Aren't you lonely?<eos> You seem to live alone.<eos> I live alone, too.<eos> Your parents...<eos> They passed away.
- You wanted me to meet you here?<eos> - Is this the Welcome Wagon girl?<eos> The girl in the photo is the Welcome Wagon girl.<eos> The guy is the ringleader.<eos> - And you're sure that's her? - That's her.<eos> His name is Donald Fagin, and these three charming lads... are the kids he mentors.<eos> Thieves, all of them.<eos> Why would those kids at the club talk to us... if they knew they'd stolen my stuff?<eos> So they could steer us in the wrong direction.<eos> Then they repeated the story to their mentor... so the stories would match.
They've found you!<eos> You said I was safe!<eos> We've got to get everyone out.<eos> My God, it's all my family.<eos> Out the back door!<eos> Maybe not!<eos> We're trapped!<eos> Christmas trees.<eos> What about them?<eos> They kill. Get away from the trees!
If you're attacking a man with a sonic screwdriver... don't let him near the sound system.<eos> It's all right, Stan, you'll be all right.<eos> Michael?<eos> Connie?<eos> Oh, Sunita, do something useful.<eos> What is it?<eos> What were they?<eos> Just stop wittering, just help 'em!<eos> Remote control for the decorations, but there's a second remote control for the robots.<eos> They're not scavengers any more.
And release!<eos> The Secret Heart unlocks and they will waken from their sleep of ages.<eos> Who will?<eos> What's down there?<eos> How thick are you? !<eos> My children!<eos> The long-lost Racnoss, now reborn to feast on flesh.<eos> The Webstar shall come to me.<eos> My babies will be hungry.<eos> They need sustenance.
Hynkel, dictator.<eos> Hitler, of course.<eos> -Come on. Leave me alone.<eos> -Why, you...<eos> He bit my finger.<eos> The Jewish barber, the tramp figure, is of course the figure of silent cinema.<eos> Silent figures are basically like figures in the cartoon.<eos> They don't know death. They don't know sexuality even.<eos> They don't know suffering.<eos> They just go on in their oral, egotistic striving, like cats and mice in a cartoon.

This can be read as the ultimate redemption of music, that the same music which served evil purposes can be redeemed to serve the good.<eos> Or it can be read, and I think it should be read, in a much more ambiguous way, that with music, we cannot ever be sure.<eos> Insofar as it externalises our inner passion, music is potentially always a threat.<eos> There is a short scene in David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, which takes place in the theatre where we are now, where behind the microphone a woman is singing, then out of exhaustion or whatever, she drops down.<eos> Surprisingly, the singing goes on.<eos> Immediately afterwards, it is explained. It was a playback.<eos> But for that couple of seconds when we are confused, we confront this nightmarish dimension of an autonomous partial object.<eos> Like in the well-known adventure of Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland, where the cat disappears, the smile remains.<eos> You may have noticed that I'm not all there myself.<eos> The fascinating thing about partial objects, in the sense of organs without bodies, is that they embody what Freud called "death drive".
Jeffrey, don't, please.<eos> My relationship towards tulips is inherently Lynchian.<eos> I think they are disgusting. Just imagine.<eos> Aren't these some kind of, how do you call it, vagina dentata, dental vaginas threatening to swallow you?<eos> I think that flowers are something inherently disgusting.<eos> I mean, are people aware what a horrible thing these flowers are?<eos> I mean, basically it's an open invitation to all the insects and bees, "Come and screw me", you know?<eos> I think that flowers should be forbidden to children.<eos> Suddenly I saw two figures jumping about on the rocks above us.<eos> They hid and peeped out occasionally.
Well...<eos> And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?<eos> -And Scarecrow's brain?<eos> -And Scarecrow's brain?<eos> Why, anybody can have a brain.<eos> That's a very mediocre commodity.<eos> Every pusillanimous creature that crawls on the earth or slinks through slimy seas has a brain.<eos> Back where I come from, we have universities, seats of great learning where men go to become great thinkers.<eos> And when they come out, they think deep thoughts and with no more brains than you have.<eos> But they have one thing you haven't got. A diploma!
You lied to us, Ana.<eos> About what ?<eos> An innocent chaperone to these kids ?<eos> You packed those pills down in Brazil.<eos> I did nothing of the sort.<eos> That's funny because we found your print packed inside one of these heroin pellets.<eos> If I pack them, they pay me triple.<eos> The money is too good to say no.<eos> So you put these kids'lives at risk.<eos> They're no angels,
Chris, you don't really believe all the things in those song lyrics, do you?<eos> No.<eos> Then why you been acting like such a punk?<eos> I guess I don't really know.<eos> I think I have an idea.<eos> Peter, when was the last time you and Chris here did something together?<eos> Boy, I guess it's been a while.<eos> Here's something you might not know:<eos> Children crave structure.<eos> They enjoy the fun of planned activities in which they and their parent or guardian can share a common goal.
Hadn't you heard her yet, grandma?<eos> Now you'll be wanting your... granddaughter, you see, rejection has turned to passion!<eos> The child is hers, don't you go looking after it, you hear... let her be the mother!<eos> I don't really know whether I'm ready to be a mother... only after it 's born...<eos> I'll see that it 's mine... I already told my mother to... keep an eye on Jéssica, because Jéssica's so flirtatious.<eos> If she's dating she won't care... if a boy comes on to her she's all smiles and loves the attention.<eos> My mother is scared of criminals, she's always wearing tight clothes... the criminals these days, where I live... they've no respect.<eos> They used to respect you, but not nowadays.<eos> For instance if I walk by and they watch me, and if I look round... and smile, then they think I'm flirting.<eos> The next time I pass by they grab me and do whatever they want.
What are you listening to?<eos> Now, we are plugged into each other.<eos> Cool man.<eos> But this isn't really plug-in.<eos> This is plug-in.<eos> You always drink tea here.<eos> Americans, they never drink tea.<eos> I started drinking tea in the mountains of a town called<eos> Ruransha * in the coast province of Afghanistan, with my Mujahidin brothers.<eos> I gave them stingers, they gave me tea.
- Yeah?<eos> Okay, hum...<eos> So what's it called?<eos> 'Cause I love scary movies.<eos> It's called, "Kill Team".<eos> A sort of horror/action flick.<eos> That's the working title?<eos> Yeah, yeah, it's... It' about how the government's been genetically alterating soldiers to become elite killer machines.<eos> One trouble is, they did too good of a job.<eos> So, when the C.I.A. comes in and try to take them out, try to execute them, they come back to life.
Where on earth are you going?<eos> My boy...<eos> Mom is not forbidding you to go out.<eos> I'm just afraid that... You are going to be with those hooligans.<eos> Mom is afraid.<eos> You're just a kid.<eos> I know it was all their fault.<eos> They've ruined you.<eos> The horrible ideas were not yours... were they?<eos> They have pushed you to do it. Right?
What are you reading?<eos> Where do you hang out at night?<eos> Nowhere.<eos> Are you from Wushan?<eos> No, Fengdu.<eos> I don't know my way around.<eos> I'm afraid of getting lost.<eos> I take you out after duty today.<eos> We will miss our dearests forever.<eos> And they will be there with us
Those kids stole that camera off my desk.<eos> How convenient.<eos> Still doesn't explain why you were showing them the surveillance system.<eos> they gave me respect.<eos> So you gave two sociopaths the keys to the kingdom?<eos> Didn't matter in the end.<eos> Me showing them the system.<eos> What do you mean it didn't matter?<eos> Those kids weren't trying not to be seen.<eos> They wanted to be on camera.
All you need to know is that you have my heart.<eos> ?<eos> This is Pierce Brenner.<eos> His name's on the sign.<eos> Sent all the employees home at 8:15, locked up.<eos> Salesman forgot his wallet, came back and found the body by 9:00, and now Brenner's car is missing. Makes sense.<eos> They've been switching cars every day or two.<eos> Yeah, but always a subordinate act to a more flamboyant violent one.<eos> These dealerships are like fishbowls at night-- it's easy to see in, hard to see out.<eos> They watched from over here.
This place makes me uncomfortable. Oh, Mr. Monk.<eos> It's just a high school.<eos> Yeah, high school wasn't the best year of my life.<eos> Oh, but look at theses.<eos> Amazing.<eos> Look at that one.<eos> State champions.<eos> Okay, That's very nice.<eos> Yeah, yeah, look at this one.<eos> Yeah, they're all very nice.
I'm going to go find her.<eos> I'm staying right here.<eos> Great idea.<eos> Wait 10 seconds and make an entrance.<eos> Drink some.<eos> Are you saying that I'm in danger?<eos> Your husband's partners are being paroled today.<eos> I have reason to believe their first order of business is going to be to try and find that lost money.<eos> But the only person who knew where that money ended up was my husband.<eos> I know that, but do they?
I didn't know you hit your kids.<eos> Why would I hit my kids?<eos> I love my kids.<eos> Just seems like you've got a rotten one.<eos> So why don't you kick her ass?<eos> Your problem is that you treat her like a kid.<eos> They don't like that.<eos> You gotta talk to them eye to eye, like equals.<eos> You respect them...<eos> they respect you.
I'll try to slow it down out here.<eos> Okay, good luck.<eos> I need a plan of this machine. Some schematics that show what the inside looks like.<eos> Then we can find it's weak points.<eos> Where are we gonna get something like that?<eos> What are you doing! ?<eos> Someone's gonna hear us!<eos> That's the point.<eos> I figure a machine this big needs engineers to run it, and when something breaks...<eos> They come to fix it.
We just had to sit around a couple hundred years for someone to invent the digital camera to show us what we're really capable of.<eos> Show of hands... who of you saw this photo from Abu Ghraib and thought, "I would never do that to another human being"?<eos> You think it's cruel and awful and unconscionable.<eos> But guess what.<eos> Of all of you who have your hands up, only two, maybe three of you, are right.<eos> In other dreary news, you have a 20-page research project due at the end of the term about the effects of imprisonment and torture.<eos> There's an alternative.<eos> I'm conducting an intensive study on the prisoner-guard relationship in which volunteers are assigned those roles.<eos> If, during the 48-hour experiment, the guards are able to extract from the prisoners some arbitrary piece of information, they are exempt.<eos> But if the prisoners manage to keep their secret, they are exempt.
I use the cane...<eos> We're just concerned.<eos> About the wrong person.<eos> I can breathe. Ezra Powell, on the other hand, is gonna die.<eos> - The Ezra Powell?<eos> - The researcher?<eos> The guy who wrote that textbook? "That" textbook?<eos> The textbook. Wait. There's actually another doctor you admire?<eos> I admire lots of doctors.<eos> Of course, most of them look a lot better in knee socks than Ezra Powell, but seeing as they can all breathe...
The old you.<eos> I needed someone to hold me in my bed at night when I cry.<eos> I needed someone to help me.<eos> After I was done helping the girls dry their goddamn tears.<eos> But the old you, he's gone.<eos> He's buried.<eos> With all of your lost brothers.<eos> And you know what?<eos> You can tell all your lost brothers to go to hell.<eos> Because we're here, and they're not.
Besides, Guy's too sensitive.<eos> A male chauvinist is what he is.<eos> Hates being challenged.<eos> Especially by a woman.<eos> He should talk to his friends about it.<eos> Are you joking?<eos> Why do men do sports together?<eos> To confide in each other, do you think?<eos> Can you see them talking about their innermost feelings?<eos> They're verbally handicapped.
You'll take the car back.<eos> You do that. This is all your fault!<eos> Will you explain why it's my fault?<eos> You don't get it?<eos> You're not that smart after all.<eos> Living in your shadow was fine, but your news changed everything.<eos> They love you as much.<eos> Parents never admit they have a favorite son, but deep down...<eos> You're lucky to be gay.<eos> You're not what they want and they can't change that.
College helps you form your character.<eos> Yeah, it formed yours alright.<eos> For 30 years you hid from your parents!<eos> Anyway, I'm sick of all this.<eos> Don't worry about the noise, I'm a sound sleeper.<eos> Wow...<eos> Quite a personality!<eos> I wouldn't worry about him.<eos> But you should see your parents.<eos> I think they deserve some of your time.
They quit their jobs for him.<eos> Yes, they are everything you'd want in a parent.<eos> Unfortunately, their kid is nothing you'd want.<eos> When a baby is born, it's perfect.<eos> Little fingers, little toes, plump, perfect, pink, and brimming with unbridled potential.<eos> Then it's downhill. Some hills steeper than others.<eos> Parents get off on their kids' accomplishments.<eos> Bend over and relax.<eos> Cute.<eos> They'll annoy you with trophy rooms and report cards.
You're still my friend.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> Get it loaded up?<eos> Aye, it's all there, sir.<eos> Ready to roll.<eos> These prisoners do not pay their way.<eos> They help those that seek to undermine my authority, therefore, they must all be punished.<eos> Now... Do you think that they're the only ones to suffer, do you?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No, because they do not pay their dues. We, the good citizens, well, we have to pay more. Hm?

Hm?<eos> And how on earth are we supposed to support our king's glorious crusade?<eos> Thank you.<eos> If they were to pay their taxes, then we in the community would pay less.
Maybe you'd find out if you gave me a gift.<eos> As it is, you only come out of the woodwork to ask me for favors.<eos> Like now.<eos> So?<eos> Do we have an interesting guest at the castle?<eos> The owner of this was on his way there.<eos> - We think he's from the East.<eos> - You've been eating too many mushrooms.<eos> My men think the Sheriff has been using a sorcerer.<eos> Well, they've been eating too many mushrooms.
They never gave up hope for his safe return.<eos> Hello, Rosemary.<eos> Oh!<eos> Hello.<eos> These gentlemen would like to talk to you.<eos> May we come in?<eos> I'm Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby, and this is Detective Sergeant Jones.<eos> It's not bad news, is it?<eos> After all these years, please don't tell me it's bad news.<eos> They only want to talk to you, Rosemary, ask you some questions.
- Thanks, Ollie.<eos> Over to you, Peter.<eos> Look, this isn't right, you know?<eos> I mean, you guys are like Harold and Maude.<eos> What would your grandchildren think?<eos> I would be remiss in my duty if I did not tell you that the idea of... intercourse and the fact of your firm young body commingling with... withered flesh, sagging breasts and flabby buttocks<eos> Tom Tucker, I forbid you to see my mother.<eos> Peter, you can't talk to Tom that way.<eos> He won a local Emmy for his work with the retardeds.<eos> They certainly wanted to hug me.
I wrote mine on the bottom of a shoe.<eos> You know what they say, that foster kids are really hard on themselves.<eos> They?<eos> Yeah, experts, psychologists...<eos> like that.<eos> Apparently, foster kids feel so alone in this mean world they lose that knack of trusting.<eos> You mean at work?<eos> Well, everywhere, you know.<eos> Weight of the world, it's... it's profound.<eos> They say that they have a hard time letting themselves off the hook.

Nora's going to die here.<eos> Not just her, everyone here.<eos> Stop.<eos> When the armageddon comes, all of us will die, me, Nora, all of us, but then we'll be saved.<eos> I promise you, this is not armageddon.<eos> I have to trust Cyrus.<eos> Lucy...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Lucy...<eos> And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they will prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days.

Yeah, I wonder.<eos> So you're going to rebuild?<eos> Well, it was a good place for us for a while, anyways.<eos> It can be again...<eos> I think.<eos> Well, Nora looks happy.<eos> She's excited.<eos> She's starting third grade in the fall.<eos> No more home schooling?<eos> Well, I think our kids need to know there's a bigger world out there, and they're a part of it, and it's part of us.
Fear becomes paranoia. Paranoia, ultimately psychosis.<eos> I bring this up because in 140 years the fundamental mind of the escaped man has not changed.<eos> The escaped man is still human, he is still afraid and he will stop at nothing in his attempted flight.<eos> Fortunately for us while our quarry has shadow and night as his ally we have something far greater.<eos> Television.<eos> I would encourage everyone who is watching everyone in this country, to take a good look at these faces.<eos> These men right here are now the eight most wanted men in America.<eos> I thought I thought this out.<eos> You saw all those guys back there?<eos> The key is they're back there and we're up here. Yeah.
Well, it's an amazing thing they did.<eos> You know, I think David is a little envious he was beaten to the punch.<eos> He'd like to have a look at it.<eos> You know, scientific curiosity.<eos> - I'll see what I can do.<eos> - Thanks, Connor.<eos> I know many of you have had a long day of traveling, so I'd just like to thank you for all coming today.<eos> Thank you for coming out, Doc.<eos> Basically, your children have a genetic sequence which is reversed.<eos> It's like, instead of A-B-C-D-E, they have E-D-C-B-A. Okay?
What? You'll see.<eos> Hey, there's Jimmy's name and Bobby's.<eos> Dennis sternberg.<eos> Vincent giamono... Jimmy richy's kid.<eos> Hard to believe it's been 5 Years, man.<eos> I saw a thing about this In the times.<eos> Picture<eos> Didn't do it justice.<eos> You realize the only reason This is here is because Firefighters are regular people.<eos> They wanted to honor the guys We've lost.
Stockholm or London, or Toronto, or Montreal, or New York...<eos> We all working with one power, one law.<eos> It's attraction.<eos> The secret is the Law of Attraction.<eos> Everything that's coming into your life, you are attracting into your life.<eos> And it's attracted to you by virtue of the image as you're holding in your mind.<eos> It's what you're thinking.<eos> You see, whatever is going on in your mind you are attracting to you.<eos> Now, wise people have always known that.<eos> You go right back to the ancient Babylonians they've always known this.
It's what you're thinking.<eos> You see, whatever is going on in your mind you are attracting to you.<eos> Now, wise people have always known that.<eos> You go right back to the ancient Babylonians they've always known this.<eos> It's a small select group of people.<eos> Why do you think that 1% of the population earns around 96% of all the money that's being earned?<eos> Do you think that's an accident?<eos> It's no accident.<eos> It's designed that way.<eos> They understand something.
Remember we're using at most 5% of the potential of the human mind.<eos> 100% human potential is the result of proper education, so imagine a world where people were using their full mental and emotional potential.<eos> We could go anywhere, we could do anything, achieve anything.<eos> See yourself with the good that you desire.<eos> Every religious book tells us that.<eos> Every great book on philosophy, every great leader, all the avatars who have ever lived<eos> Go back and study the wise ones.<eos> Many of them have been presented to you in this programme.<eos> You know what?<eos> They all understood one thing - they understood the secret.
You feel all right?<eos> I'm all right.<eos> He's talking nonsense.<eos> See if I have a fever.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Daughter, you have a fever.<eos> Look!<eos> Stand up!<eos> Sit down, sit down children.<eos> They are...
#<eos> So what about Kak Khalil?<eos> Where is he?<eos> Kak Khalil's time has come.<eos> He died.<eos> What?<eos> When did he die?<eos> Yesterday afternoon.<eos> Where are the villagers?<eos> They're at the cemetery.
- Mrs. Nazaré...<eos> First class goods.<eos> Why are you crying?<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> I'm here to help you.<eos> All of you.<eos> That 's why Mr. Tadeu brought you here.<eos> Now you're gonna take a good bath and rest.<eos> Tonight you'll get new dresses, and some gentlemen will come over... to adopt you.<eos> They'll be your new "daddies", and will give you a better life.
Like, it was as important for them to see what was going on as it was for him.<eos> Public humiliation.<eos> I said, watch it!<eos> Robbery wasn't about the money.<eos> It was about getting off on what he made these people do on this spot.<eos> Forcing others to squirm and watch.<eos> We got to know what exactly they were forced to do.<eos> We need to see the fantasy.<eos> Did you ever get a hold of the security videos?<eos> Yes, but they were mostly erased.
- What'd she say?<eos> Hardcore or not, you've got the wrong scumbag.<eos> According to witnesses, he came in and fired into ceiling.<eos> He separated all the kids from their parents.<eos> Then?<eos> He's forcing the sons to hit their mothers.<eos> He started to. When he tried to get the first one to hit his mother harder, he refused, and when he refused... it doesn't make sense. They're children.<eos> He's playing out a fantasy.<eos> Yeah, but it's his fantasy and someone else's children.<eos> They're surrogates of some kind.
- If you don't mind me saying... you seem to be a tad overstaffed in your control room.<eos> You could reassign...<eos> Say no more!<eos> You're right again, #2.<eos> Him and... the dead guy next to him.<eos> This place is all creepy since that mumbly guy just magically showed up.<eos> Totally!<eos> And those new Black Guard dicks... took the Tekken 3 game out of the lounge!<eos> Those guys are wicked spooky.<eos> How unfair is it that they get the cool uniforms?
His name is Demitrius James.<eos> He's in surgery.<eos> He is he, like, a gangbanger or something?<eos> Actually... he's a student at the University.<eos> He gonna be okay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Has someone called your parents?<eos> We should let them know.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> They still think I'm in the lab.
I'm raising a teenager here.<eos> Oh, you're doing a great job.<eos> Lindsey's gonna turn out to be a beautiful young woman.<eos> Besides, I grew up in Vegas, I didn't turn out so bad, did I?<eos> Yeah, that was pre-Mirage, back when you were a little squirt going to the casino playing the arcade games.<eos> No.<eos> Vegas is a different animal now.<eos> Yeah, these kids need to beat people on the street to be entertained.<eos> They just need some good discipline.<eos> They need, huh- their grand mother whipping their ass like... like I had.
Hey, missy.<eos> Hi.<eos> My name is Carensa Sanders, and I'm recording this application to be a suicide girl.<eos> I figured if I could let you into my world, here in heart-stopping casper, wyoming, that maybe you'd let me in yours.<eos> As you can tell by my bedroom, I'm a typical high school senior.<eos> My parents think I'm little miss "a" student.<eos> Little do they, know...
- You fool around with her husband?<eos> - No.<eos> - He's ugly? - No.<eos> Oh, no, he's...<eos> He's hot.<eos> He's a doctor.<eos> I worked for some doctors.<eos> They wanted the kid safe, so they let me drive the Lexus.<eos> And they went away a lot, so I could always use their apartment.<eos> Which they didn't know about.
- The host of "The Tonight Show."<eos> That's what I was doing.<eos> So, my wife Mavis and I like to go shopping for old cars, you know?<eos> No, no, like Jay Leno.<eos> Like, "Hey, here are the headlines."<eos> "Have you ever noticed when you eat a lot of cheese..."<eos> How is that different from what I was doing?<eos> And I don't think you need to introduce the writers to the tour group.<eos> I agree.<eos> I thought they would find it interesting, but they really did not.
Oh, what's this?<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - Who's Kenny?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> I just want it to be Richardson.<eos> That's right because of the drinking and the poker.<eos> Yeah, I know there's a lot of animals at the zoo.<eos> Monkeys... monkeys are Daddy's favorite.<eos> They're just like people.
Well, we found this in her lung.<eos> What?<eos> - Her lung?<eos> - It was enveloped during decomp.<eos> Kenny?<eos> Any reference to a Kenny in the case file?<eos> No, but whoever Kenny is liked her enough to get her a locket.<eos> Maybe Kyle wasn't the only one who was cheating.<eos> Opens up a lot of possibilities.<eos> I say we just go talk to Carlie's friends and see if they know who Kenny is.
Can you separate it ?<eos> Oh, I think so.<eos> Well, there's our boy, Hawk Reed.<eos> Bring up one of those crates, please.<eos> So they're offloading guns at Bayfront Port.<eos> A couple hundred of these Corner Shots here.<eos> About 9,000 apiece.<eos> Worth two million dollars purchased from the Crypt Kings for sale to whom, Mr. Andrews ?<eos> I purchased them for my friends.<eos> - They like to hunt.
Honest.<eos> Hey, guys, I hate to interrupt your lunch, but I was wondering if you could help me with something ?<eos> I want to know what drug this guy was on, and which one of you killed him.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Is that delicate enough for you ?<eos> Sheriff.<eos> I'm really starting to tire of this.<eos> Well, then, I'll make it easy on you.<eos> Have these guys submit to a drug test.<eos> Do you have evidence that they're taking something illegal ?
Those guys that you said that Linderman would send to get his money back... Yeah?<eos> Well, he did.<eos> And now they're dead. On the floor of my garage.<eos> What?<eos> How?<eos> That's just it.<eos> I don't know.<eos> What do you mean you don't know?<eos> I mean I don't know.<eos> I just--I woke up, and they were dead and...
I had a rare domestic goddess moment.<eos> Oh, thanks, uh... yeah, he's-- no, he's working, um... but I'm sure he'll love this when he gets home from work.<eos> Okay, well, I'll see you later.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> Mm-hmm, bye.<eos> They'll be a man sitting in a tall chair,that's the judge.<eos> And they'll be 12 people listening to everything you say.<eos> Okay.<eos> And you're a smart guy, Ethan.<eos> And when smart guys testify in court they tell the truth, right?
Make them suffer through it, moment by excruciating moment.<eos> Remember, this isn't a recitation of facts, this is a plea for justice.<eos> Sydney, could you please tell us what happened when the defendants lead you into that room?<eos> At first, we were laughing. Then Brent started touching my breasts.<eos> I told him to stop, but that's when Seth grabbed me from behind... and held me down.<eos> I know this is difficult, but can you tell us what was going through your mind?<eos> It was like a nightmare.<eos> They were on top of me, tearing off my clothes.<eos> I knew what they were doing, but I tried to pretend like it wasn't happening.<eos> They raped me.
I want the courtroom closed and a gag order on the jury.<eos> I'll draw up the paperwork.<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> I was pissed off that Sydney came to the party.<eos> I was with my girlfriend. I didn't want a whole weird scene.<eos> So, what did you do?<eos> I asked Brent and Seth to help me out, and they took her downstairs.<eos> To the rec room?<eos> Yeah.<eos> At first it was cool. Sydney was having a good time with those guys. Then she wanted to leave, and you know, they wouldn't let her go.
Uh, we're way past our nightly check-in.<eos> The sun is almost coming up.<eos> Did you want to... borrow a cup of sugar?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Well, actually, I was just... calling to say thank you.<eos> What for?<eos> You know what for.<eos> You know, Lillian told me once that... we were defined by the decisions we make.<eos> Robots don't make decisions.<eos> They execute code.
There were two men.<eos> They said they were from the FBI and that they were supposed to pick up the body.<eos> - Did they show you their ID ?<eos> - Yes sir.<eos> These guys really clean up after themselves.<eos> And we've got nothing again.<eos> That's not completely true.<eos> I always do a set of polaroids, just in case.<eos> I'll be in my office when you're finished.<eos> First they kill Frost's engineer and now Wolf, and they do it right in front of us.
It's all right,honey.<eos> Earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them.<eos> They're stuck here because they have unfinished business with the living and they come to me for help.<eos> In order to tell you my story, I have to tell you theirs.<eos> That looks great on you.<eos> With a top hat and a whip,fabulous.<eos> If you need help getting out of that, I'm right over here.<eos> God,I love halloween.<eos> My parents use to make such a big deal out of it.<eos> When I was a kid,they used to decorate the house up like this big movie set.
It is.I'm listening to myself say it,and it sounds crazy.<eos> Then again,why not?<eos> It's almost halloween.<eos> It's true.My grandmother always saidthat the veil between the living and the dead got thinner around halloween.<eos> The only way to prove something like that... would be if you found where the other body was,right?<eos> Yes,and then I could talk to the ghost.<eos> But I have searched the internet, and I can't find anything on adam godfrey's death.<eos> I even checked with his publishers.<eos> Oh,yeah?<eos> What did they say?
It's like we don't even know each other anymore.<eos> I told her about Lex. She...<eos> She made a phone call to someone named Robert Pontius.<eos> The highest-Paid sam spade in Metropolis ?<eos> Maybe Lex knew he was in trouble.<eos> I want to talk to this guy and see what he knows.<eos> When you escaped from the Kryptonian land of the lost, I bet you didn't think that you'd be rewarded By having to save Lex Luthor while battling a raging head cold, huh ?<eos> Not exactly the goodbye gift I was expecting, no.<eos> I guess heroes don't get sick days.<eos> They also don't put the world in jeopardy on an annual basis.
Man must know all there is to know about this enemy.<eos> Whether the shark is really an enemy.<eos> If he is, how to protect against him.<eos> If he isnt, how to live with him.<eos> - Youre told your whole life, since youre a kid, sharks are dangerous.<eos> Youre warned about venturing too far into the ocean, but then finally youre underwater, and you see the thing you were taught your whole life to fear, and its perfect, and it doesnt want to hurt you,<eos> and its the most beautiful thing youve ever seen, and your whole world changes.<eos> Ever since I was little, lve loved the ocean.<eos> Like many kids, I tried fishing, but realized I was much happier swimming with fish than catching them.<eos> Sharks were my favourite animals on Earth, but all Id heard about was how dangerous they were.
and its the most beautiful thing youve ever seen, and your whole world changes.<eos> Ever since I was little, lve loved the ocean.<eos> Like many kids, I tried fishing, but realized I was much happier swimming with fish than catching them.<eos> Sharks were my favourite animals on Earth, but all Id heard about was how dangerous they were.<eos> I hated being afraid and realized the only way to find out the truth about sharks was to meet one for myself.<eos> I became an underwater photographer and a biologist, and from that point on, I followed sharks.<eos> So little is known about what they really are and how important they are to life on Earth.<eos> Two-thirds of the worlds surface is water, and over 8o% of life on Earth lives in the ocean.<eos> I learned to dive so I could get close to sharks, but photographing sharks was harder than I thought.<eos> Theyre so afraid of us.
You hardly have really serious bites.<eos> So that tells us something, 6o to 1oo bites every year out of these millions and millions of encounters that we have with these animals.<eos> So just based on that, sharks cannot be dangerous.<eos> People think:<eos> Well, theyre dumb, theyre stupid.<eos> Thats not true.<eos> Their intelligence is quite amazing.<eos> They have short-term memories, long-term memories, they can learn by observation.<eos> So nothing is stupid or primitive in these animals.<eos> So all the ideas, well, they just follow a blood trail, they just bite everything that is shiny.
They wont bother wasting energy going after something they know they cant eat efficiently.<eos> When a shark mistake does happen, the person inevitably ends up back on shore.<eos> In most shark attacks, flesh is never removed.<eos> Even in the odd case where someone dies, its usually because of blood loss, not because the shark ate the person.<eos> A twelve-foot or even a six-foot fish could do anything it wanted to a human, and they dont.<eos> Its a huge testament to sharks sensory systems how few people are attacked each year.<eos> You wouldnt go for a run next to a pride of lions, but we do this with sharks all the time.<eos> There are millions of people entering the water every year in areas where sharks hunt, and very few people are bitten.<eos> If they wanted to eat us, they would.<eos> The mythology about sharks has traditionally been, uh, theyre kind of the embodiment of evil and they have sharp teeth and they kill people.
The fin is tasteless, adding only texture to a soup flavoured with chicken or pork broth.<eos> It became a status symbol, served at weddings, banquets, and expensive dinners.<eos> A single pound of fin is worth more than $2oo US, and the shark-fin industry is a billion-dollar juggernaut.<eos> Every year, an estimated 3o to 7o million sharks are killed to support a growing worldwide trade in their fins and other products.<eos> 2ND TV COMMENTATOR: But the biggest prize is the shark fin.<eos> Half a world away, in Hong Kong and China, shark-fin soup is a delicacy.<eos> It sells for up to $9o a bowl.<eos> DR. SAMUEL GRUBER: Lts a royal food;<eos> its the food of the emperors.<eos> They make a soup out of the fins, and any Chinese chef thats worth his weight has to be able to make great shark-fin soup, as strange as that may seem, and this is causing the demise of the populations of sharks in the ocean.
Every animal and ecosystem in the Galapagos depends on the ocean for survival.<eos> Sharks have a really tough time catching seals and sea lions.<eos> They shaped these animals, putting pressure on them so they evolved ways of avoiding sharks.<eos> The seal evolved hyper-mobile backbones, making them extremely agile in the water and a difficult target for sharks.<eos> The sharks have to ambush the seals or find an injured one.<eos> To ambush a seal, they swim below, out of visible range, looking for the silhouette of a seal - a very similar silhouette to a human on the surface.<eos> A healthy seal moves through the water without any noise or bubbles.<eos> But an injured one will flail about, creating a disturbance in the water, just like humans when we swim.<eos> Its amazing how few people are attacked each year, considering how much we look like shark food.<eos> - We treat animals differently, but theyre all doing the same thing.
We hadnt totally failed in saving sharks.<eos> We helped awaken a country and the people.<eos> Costa Ricans were outraged;<eos> they held protests against the private docks and spoke out against the corruption.<eos> The world had started rallying for sharks.<eos> The police were busy with the protest and the Mafia was in hiding.<eos> Now I knew I could make it to Cocos without getting caught.<eos> I found my friends and we headed back out to sea.<eos> Returning underwater, finally I could swim with sharks again, in one of the last places on Earth where sharks thrive.<eos> Free diving... I hold my breath and stay calm so theyre not afraid of me.
"Sharks are a nuisance, a dead shark is a good shark, lets kill em all." But if we kill em all, we destroy all food chains of an entire marine ecosystem and, well, the majority of our oxygen comes from the ocean,<eos> - There is no species on this planet that has ever survived by ignoring the basic laws of ecology, and were now breaking those basic laws every day in every way, and thats going to mean our own demise in a very short period of time,<eos> unless we learn to live harmoniously with the natural world.<eos> - Future generations are gonna look back on us and theyre gonna think of us as barbarians, the same way we think of slave traders.<eos> That theyre gonna look at us as barbarians for what were doing, the fact that were burning all the fossil fuels, in a few generations, that weve wiped out the oceans, that weve driven species to extinction.<eos> And worse - this is the worst part - we know what were doing.<eos> The scientists know, the environmentalists know, the companies know and the general public knows, and yet were allowing ourselves to do it.<eos> - Sharks have lived in balance with the oceans as the top predator.<eos> Now we are the top predator, deciding which species well use and which well destroy.<eos> I wonder if weve evolved enough to survive as they have.
Pool table?<eos> That's an interesting idea.<eos> You realize,woodcock,you're never getting that pool table.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah,we are.<eos> No.Your wife said, "that's an interesting idea."<eos> That's woman talk for, "maybe when the sun burns out."<eos> What do you got going on with those papers there?<eos> You're very busy.<eos> Oh,these are just some flyers telling the kids about a web site I set up, so they can e-mail me with their questions or concerns.
I'll be right back, go on up.<eos> [What about the boy?<eos> ]<eos> [The boy's at my place! ]<eos> [But where's he going to stay?<eos> ]<eos> [What about his parents? Where are they?<eos> ]<eos> [Not here, not there.]<eos> [I don't know where they are.]
[No! Only the father.]<eos> Send him to the orphanage!<eos> [That's absurd!<eos> ] Not the orphanage!<eos> [He's Mótel's grandson.]<eos> If you think it's easy, why don't you ask the kid to live with you?<eos> Or you.<eos> No one wants to live with the boy.<eos> The problem isn't the boy... the problem is why his parents don't come back.<eos> The Rabbi thinks they're mixed up in politics.
I have to go.<eos> Want to come with me?<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - I'm too busy.<eos> - All right.<eos> Hi!<eos> Change your mind?<eos> What about your parents?<eos> They're coming back to watch the World Cup with me.
Have some coffee.<eos> Can you play table football?<eos> Mauro, I'm hardly in the mood for games.<eos> You're just scared.<eos> Great save!<eos> That's not fair, you moved!<eos> Yeah, before though. Get into goal.<eos> Direct free kick.<eos> Ítalo, do you know anything about my parents?<eos> Where they are?
I wish you weren't my grandpa.<eos> Don't talk to me like that again.<eos> They had it coming.<eos> Those boys have no respect.<eos> They're punks.<eos> Now, I love my son, but he didn't do right by Jason.<eos> So you thought you'd beat respect into him.<eos> I don't need a lecture about how to discipline my grandson.<eos> That's the trouble with parents today, they're afraid of their own kids.<eos> Sounds like they were afraid of you. That's the way it's supposed to be.
I'm doing them a favor.<eos> The neighborhood's not what it used to be.<eos> Crime rate's tripled the last year alone.<eos> Vandalism, robberies, the recent murder.<eos> If an area is blighted, the city has no choice but to rectify the problem.<eos> A blight that took place after you became interested.<eos> In my career, I've often benefited from luck and good timing.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I got your call. What's going on, Austin ?<eos> My parents aren't even home, and they're trying to evict us.
Me, too.<eos> I got your call. What's going on, Austin ?<eos> My parents aren't even home, and they're trying to evict us.<eos> Wolfe, tell your buddy he's working my last nerve.<eos> You're gonna have to wait until after the hearing.<eos> Aren't they entitled to a hearing ?<eos> Talk to the judge.<eos> Yeah, an Order of Possession.<eos> Signed and sealed.<eos> They got to vacate.
That should be easy, 'cause I know he's stuffed in the back of your truck.<eos> Please...<eos> It's for you, it's Hop.<eos> - Hopper?<eos> - Baxter, listen good, 'cause I only have time to tell you this once.<eos> Now you gotta follow my exact instructions, or Damien will kill you.<eos> - Do you understand me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I know about the guys who've been squeezing you, in the blue sedan.<eos> I need you to contact them for me and tell them I'll give them whatever they want, okay?
Look at page seven at the bottom.<eos> "Is Studio 60 patriotic or unpatriotic?"<eos> Split 50-50 right down party lines.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> You're surprised?<eos> No, I don't believe that we asked the question.<eos> I don't believe that we asked the question, and I don't believe we only gave them those two choices for an answer, and since when did Democrat or Republican become a demographic distinction we care about in the entertainment industry?<eos> Since the first plane made a left turn and gunned its engines into the North Tower, kitten.<eos> I just want to make sure that the guys remember it's still an extremely polarized country they're writing for.<eos> They remember.
I wasn't giving it my all because I got laughs tonight in "Commedia."<eos> I'm gonna change for the party.<eos> - You owe me 15 seconds of fame.<eos> - That's all I got on me right now.<eos> Hey, T, listen, I'm gonna ask Matt to slip off to the lmprov around 11 to see a guy. Wanna come?<eos> - My parents are here tonight.<eos> - No kidding? I wanna meet them.<eos> Really?<eos> Twenty-seven is too old to have mommy-and-daddy issues.<eos> They don't know what I do for a living, my brother.
I'll be at Princeton tomorrow.<eos> Dad wouldn't want me to miss my first day of classes.<eos> Okay.<eos> You saw a spiderweb in the bunker, you said?<eos> Yeah, at least I thought so. Until my dad hit it.<eos> I should have said something.<eos> There was nothing you could have done.<eos> That's another one of those stupid things people say.<eos> Well, I got a million of them.<eos> You should ask my coworkers, they'll tell you.
You're not gonna know until you try.<eos> I'm sorry about the painting.<eos> Listen, something else happened in Vegas that I...<eos> What?<eos> These two guys, they tired to pull me out of my hotel room.<eos> They did.<eos> It was like a kidnapping attempt or something.<eos> How'd you get away?<eos> I flew.<eos> So, who were they? I mean...
Mother!<eos> Charn, I didn't know you were upstairs.<eos> When did you get back?<eos> You haven't taken off your dirty clothes?<eos> That's disgusting!<eos> Well, yesterday, Buey called looking for you.<eos> He told me that late last night, something happened and you disappeared from the scene. I was so worried about you I couldn't sleep all night. I had to put out the fire on the other side, mom, Buey didn't know that.<eos> I watched the news and they said there was a snatching of a prisoner as well. There were gun shots.<eos> Were you there?<eos> They were wicked.
Charn!<eos> You stay out of this!<eos> Do you have any idea how much my face surgery cost?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Looking at the scene, I don't think they wanted to rob you, and I don't think your friend has been shot.<eos> There's no blood and the bullet is here.<eos> Mother, I think it's not safe for you to stay home alone. Come stay with me for a while. I don't understand what happen to me.<eos> Those people want the "Sun Amulet" in your body back.<eos> We don't know what they would want the Sun Amulet and the Moon Amulet for.<eos> The only thing we know is when these two amulets combined; they will make a really severe power we can't imagine.
Good morning.<eos> Welcome back to the World News.<eos> This morning, we were reported of ...a news that has been on the front page of every newspaper. It surprises us all.<eos> "Hit the car with his knees, he helped the police arresting the thieves"<eos> Matichon also has one, "Police were shocked, Terminator 2005, stopping the thieves with his knees"<eos> He jumped off from the top of Rama 8th Bridge. He's not Jacky Chan!<eos> ?<eos> The threat that the Americans are very afraid of at present is nothing else but the suicide bombing.<eos> Mr. Gerald Farrell, former FBI agent, said that the operation of the suicide bombers rarely fail as these bombers would<eos> They will stay with the bomb until it explode and smash them into pieces.
Charn!<eos> Charn, help me!<eos> Don't think that we'll give up because of the failure of our missile! We still have Plan B!<eos> Our suicide bombers have spread throughout Bangkok. They only wait for my order.<eos> Business that belongs to the Americans both in Bangkok and here will be destroyed within seconds.<eos> We value death while the Americans value living and that's our advantage.<eos> You may think we are cruel like the wild animals that we kill people no matter who they are!<eos> We only want to say that we have been living with others peacefully but war has hurt us.<eos> War that made by those countries with great powers.<eos> They incited us and made us kill each other.

We can't I want them to the taste this pain and to know that from now own we will set our own destiny.
Cupcake?<eos> Only a dollar for a very good cause.<eos> Not right now, Claire Bear.<eos> You've been on the phone for an hour.<eos> Who you been talking to?<eos> Yeah, about that.<eos> You know how you've been wanting to<eos> - meet your biological parents? - Yeah?<eos> I just got off the phone with them.<eos> Turns out they want to meet you too, tomorrow.
Probably just think I was all bitter because they gave me away.<eos> You're a little bitchy sometimes, but I don't think you're all that bitter.<eos> About the adoption thing, I mean.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I mean, I'm curious about it.<eos> And it's a little weird and maybe a little sad, but I'm not mad.<eos> I mean, I love my parents.<eos> What if your biological parents raised you, though?<eos> It'd be an entirely different scenario.<eos> What if they can do what I can do?

But when someone thinks you made a mistake and you didn't, it... It just gets a lot more complicated.<eos> We framed him.<eos> We killed his crew.<eos> Stole $2 million.<eos> We killed those thugs in the garage.<eos> Killed those little bitches at the poker game.<eos> - We've been very busy.<eos> - Those men were ripped apart.<eos> Yeah, well... What can I say?<eos> - But they didn't do anything to me.
That's just something you gotta figure out for yourself.<eos> Can we throw these away?<eos> - Are they burnt?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm just afraid I'll eat 'em all if we don't.<eos> You know, I have to hand it to your dad.<eos> This isn't the first time we've tried to find those bio-parents.<eos> - It's not? - Un-uh.<eos> When you were a baby... we thought you had something wrong with your chromosomes. Some disease.<eos> We needed to screen your parents to see if they were carriers.
Excuse me.<eos> Uh, we're just curious.<eos> Did you see if the convicts actually found what they were digging for?<eos> No.<eos> But sure sounded like they did.<eos> The Spaniard, he took off with one of my daughter's camping packs and he left the other ones in a real tizzy.<eos> Sounded like he screwed 'em over something fierce.<eos> And they just let him leave?<eos> Well, they weren't happy about it, but, yeah.<eos> He took off on his motorbike, and then they left a few minutes later.
[Ray] The American people are being kept in the dark about all this.<eos> If there weren't free shows like yours, and for few others in the internet, you wouldn't never have the chance to learn the truth of this.<eos> What Cindy Sheehan has done is...<eos> ...brought a human dimension to this.<eos> She said: "Look, people are getting killed, including my son, a lot of Iraqis are getting killed..."<eos> "Why don't we face up to whether this war makes any sense at all?"<eos> "Do we really wanna have our young people sacrificed for for what?"<eos> [4th man] We don't know.<eos> We don't know what's going on.<eos> To tell you the truth my kids don't know the things that are involved in the decisions I make in my house, and that doesn't mean that they need to be involved in the decisions, because I know better than they know, because I'm more informed,
It was on the tip of my tongue, to tell them-- everything.<eos> To give up all I know about the network here in the kingdom.<eos> You, this house, these children.<eos> It might all be gone, had my rescuer come half an hour later.<eos> It's pure, pure chance that saved me.<eos> There is no such thing as chance.<eos> You should be strengthened to receive such a strong and unmistakable message of intervention on your behalf.<eos> It was not those commandos who rescued you,<eos> It was Allah Himself.<eos> They were but the instruments of His will.
IT WAS JENNY WHO TOOK THE FALL.<eos> JENNY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN.<eos> NINERE LEFT, WHO WILL BE VOIGHTED OUT TONIGHT?<eos> ? I GUESS YOU'RE ALREADY UP.<eos> ?<eos> I REALIZED THE FIRST TIME I WAS OUT THERE IT WAS JUST LIKE<eos> AND MUCH MORE SKITTISH.<eos> I'LL BRING BACK A BUNCH.<eos> THWAY THE VOTES CAME DOWN LAST NIGHT,<eos> THEY COULD HAVE GOTTEN RID OF ME AT ANY POINT.
Men would do everything for you before get laid.<eos> After that, they change.<eos> Why?<eos> Men and women are fundamentally two different kinds of species.<eos> Women like to be cared by a man.<eos> While men like to care all women.<eos> That's the reason!<eos> Men are like that.<eos> I care so much for them.<eos> Even though they never appreciate, don't make it looks like it's all my fault.
Want some breakfast?<eos> How can you eat after that?<eos> Can't work without eating...<eos> What work?<eos> I thought I'd record the results.<eos> The pineal gland was stimulated.<eos> It gave me one hell of a headache.<eos> Expansion of the pineal.<eos> I'll have to do a study of CAT scans of scyzophrenics.<eos> If there's a statistical correlation between scyzophrenia and an enlarged pineal... They may be seeing or feeling what we saw.
I don't keep secrets from them.<eos> They know I did drugs before our parents died.<eos> Clever.<eos> Admit the past.<eos> Deny the present.<eos> I'm clean.<eos> I'm raising two kids.<eos> It'd be pretty irresponsible, wouldn't it?<eos> But confiding in an eight-year-old is okay.<eos> If I'm open with them, then they'll be open with me.
Oh, yeah.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's just, you were moaning...<eos> We're friends, Matt.<eos> I thought I could trust you.<eos> Look, Kimber, I'm sorry, but I like you.<eos> I guess you have that effect on the men in my family.<eos> And you thought that because I had relationships with your dads that I was just gonna screw you, too?<eos> I thought you were different than they were, Matt.
"I was asking why you are appearing together rather than separately, which was their request."<eos> "Because it's a good chance both of us to answer questions that the 9/11 Commission is..<eos> looking forward to asking us and I'm looking forward to answering them, let's see."<eos> "We have to have one story, so I'll say a part and, if I get it wrong, hedge a little bit, and give me the next."<eos> "I want to thank the Chairman and Vice-chairman for giving us the chance to share views on, on, on different subjects.<eos> They had a lot of good questions and it was, I'm glad I did it. I'm glad I took the time."<eos> "What topic did the commissioners want to spend most of the time on?"<eos> "I really, probably best that I not go into the details of the conversation."<eos> Don't you think they should be able to stand up and and and speak their own words?<eos> They should go under oath.
Hey, Lor, Professor Quincy's talk is about to start and I know you probably don't...<eos> Don't want to miss a word.<eos> Yes, that's true.<eos> Well, we've got to go.<eos> You enjoy your evening.<eos> But astrophysics waits for no man.<eos> When supernovae explode, they emit an energy that is four billion times greater than the sun.<eos> So powerful are these explosions that even though they're occurring halfway across the observable universe, some seven billion light-years away...<eos> My parents have got a lot of nerve, you know?<eos> That's one thing they've got, is nerve.

They get dinner, and we get lunch?
In three days, I will set out for Gaul myself and confront our enemies.<eos> They will learn the error of their ways.<eos> This will be a defining moment in Rome's new history.<eos> A revolution in the way Rome conducts its campaigns.<eos> I will quash my deluded enemy, not with the sword, but with art.<eos> My art.<eos> I intend to sing to them.<eos> First, I'll stand on the battlefield and let their gaze fall upon me.<eos> And then, I will simply... weep.<eos> And on seeing how deeply they hurt me, they will weep.
and it stops you from thinking, it stops you from being innovative.<eos> It stops you from thinking about,<eos> "Well, how do we redesign the transportation system so we don't have those problems anymore."<eos> So he's worked with priests and he's worked with religious people and kind of expand their horizons a bit so they can be more creative.<eos> They look at the environment that shapes people's behavior and they don't call them good or bad anymore, they think about shaping the environment to get more constructive behavior.<eos> If you were to ask me to redesign the world and the way people live, first thing I would have to do is conduct a survey - find out what we have. How much water we have, how many...<eos> how much people, how much arable land area.<eos> After I know that, then I can base the parameters of the design on what we have.<eos> What you really need is an understanding of the Earth's resources, by agronomists, geologists, geophysicists - people who study the Earth.<eos> They don't give you there opinion, they say, "There's more life in the Antarctic..."
Yes, sir.<eos> 22 rocket on hit.<eos> 22. 20-- 22 rock--<eos> I can't hear you.<eos> 22.<eos> I can't hear you.<eos> 22!<eos> 22 rocket-- This should be--<eos> You're QB1 of the Dillon Panthers.<eos> Your teammates, if they can hear you, they will believe in you.
No, no, no. I knew your sense of analysis suited my own.<eos> You're making it sound like, like that's changed.<eos> Well, Charles, let's face it. I mean, your passion has taken you down many new roads:<eos> your work with Don, your convergence theory...<eos> My program's got something here.<eos> Hey, look in the eyebrow.<eos> I think those are numbers.<eos> My algorithm was able to find an image embedded in, in this region here.<eos> I e-mailed a JPEG to your techs.<eos> They stripped away the extraneous squares, which then revealed a series of letters and numbers.
He's going crazy.<eos> He's gonna break something.<eos> He's outside.<eos> Gabe's got it under control.<eos> Come on, Sarah.<eos> I just have him for a week.<eos> What's up, Little Chicken?<eos> I got thirsty.<eos> She overdid it playing with the guys.<eos> Yeah, well, they can be very trying, can't they when they've got it all under control?
Your powers of invisibility are well intact.<eos> Get up.<eos> You're a hosebag,you know that?<eos> - And you have a potty mouth.<eos> - Nobody's cutting me open.<eos> Hey,it's surgery. We do it all the time.<eos> In fact,it's all we do.<eos> You can't keep telling my foster parents I'm defective.<eos> They can't afford surgery. It's too expensive.<eos> They can handle it.

You're not talking about a sack of gum drops that's gonna be smashed.<eos> You're talking about a dame's life.<eos> Well, I think, first of all, I think it was invented by people like Robert Mitchum and Kirk Douglas.<eos> I don't think there was such a thing as film noir until those guys actually showed up onscreen and had the personas that they had and the movies that they made.<eos> - Well, the last guy in the world.<eos> - I hate surprises, myself.<eos> You want to just shut the door and forget it?<eos> No, no.<eos> Come on in.<eos> When I'd see him onscreen I kind of could see that they weren't acting so much as they were being themselves, they were presenting the character through their own personality.

In the autumn of 312 AD, Constantine's army was camped 40 miles north of Rome.<eos> One of the two emperors in the west,<eos> Constantine was preparing for the decisive battle against his rival, Maxentius.<eos> Maxentius has withdrawn his troops.<eos> The road ahead is clear.<eos> Gentlemen, this is the final push.<eos> Tomorrow we march on Rome.<eos> Majesty, with respect, shouldn't we wait for reinforcements?<eos> No.<eos> - They can be here in three weeks.
Constantine will die, his army will never reach the city,<eos> and "the enemy of Rome will be defeated. "<eos> Stay with me, please, I'm frightened.<eos> - I need to see that the men are following orders.<eos> - Orders. What orders?<eos> Lactantius wants the men to paint the Christian sign on their shields.<eos> He says that if we use it as our standard...<eos> You've caught something from that sorcerer!<eos> What will the men think when they can't fight under their gods?<eos> They will lose their nerve, Maxentius will win!
It looks like a very old forest, and it's magical.<eos> I want to stay in it.<eos> You can see this forest?<eos> Yes. But it's not here.<eos> It's just an illusion, Jasmine.<eos> Your friends are just playing a game with you.<eos> The real forest can never come back.<eos> Oh, it can.<eos> When they take me to it.<eos> They told you this?
They worshiped their baseball hero father.<eos> You think they're going tolook up to some used car salesman? I don't know.<eos> I thought the wife really seemed to care about him.<eos> Well, I might be cynical, but I've seen an awfullot of wives move on after the baseball money dries up.<eos> And the agents?<eos> It's my job to take care of my clients, to keep them playing and making money as long as they can.<eos> Obviously, I have to care about their health and well-being.<eos> But with Vick, it was different.<eos> He was actually one of my best friends.<eos> Professor Waldie sent out queries, asking fantasy league players if they've seen similar work and this is what we got back. Hmm.
Of course I can get help.<eos> I should have thought about it!<eos> If they are the expired, then the staff at the centre... It's them.<eos> The staff are the expired, and the expired are the staff.<eos> Don't you realise?<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> The help we need is inside the centre.<eos> I know where to find the real nurses.<eos> If I set them free, they will help us.
For that, you must eat or die.<eos> Eat.<eos> There's plenty to eat.<eos> plenty?<eos> Those crabs.<eos> Crabs?<eos> Do you want to see your baby?<eos> Toki ate the crabs that ate her lover's dead flesh.<eos> She devoured those crabs.<eos> They ate Hayashida to the bone.
Now, Hirosuke has returned.<eos> Without knowing it, you slept with your own sister, Hideko.<eos> You copuIated as man and woman.<eos> You two have committed the blasphemous act of incest.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Enough!<eos> I will not deform people.<eos> Do as I say or stay in this cave until you die.<eos> The one that dies first is food for the crabs and insects.<eos> They, in turn, are your food.
- How's your hangover?<eos> - What hangover?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You were on a different planet last night.<eos> I sensed the presence of a 6-pack at least.<eos> You sensed the presence of something but it wasn't alcohol related.<eos> Wait, you had a ghost last night without me?<eos> Well, something strange is going on.<eos> Last night there were lights flickering, cards flying, and there were bugs-beetles- I saw them on the floor.<eos> They were just swimming in my shirt.
- No, he could be yemeni, but odds are he's egyptian.<eos> What type of name is Gideon?<eos> American.<eos> I often forget that in your culture, you put your country first and your god last.<eos> Sir, he was born and raised in egypt.<eos> They pronounce "J" sounds as a "G".<eos> You don't consider yourself egyptian as well as muslim?<eos> Egyptian.<eos> In two minutes, you know more about me than those thugs found out in two months.<eos> They and I have... very, very different motives and methodologies.
Well, you're a minor with a sheet.<eos> If I take a weapon off you right now, you're down with juvie, so be smart, and don't make me chase you down.<eos> Tell your boys to take off.<eos> I'll check y'all later, man.<eos> ?<eos> It was just a normal party.<eos> People were drinking, but nobody was out of control.<eos> Was there tension between the white kids and the black kids?<eos> Not that I saw.<eos> They've partied with us before.
Sorbet, not ice cream.<eos> You don't want to turn into a big tub of goo like your father.<eos> And those are expensive new shirts.<eos> If you stain them, don't even bother coming back.<eos> - What now?<eos> - Oh, nothing. Nothing.<eos> I was just thinking about mothers and kids and crying.<eos> So much crying.<eos> - Well, what do you think of my boys?<eos> - Oh, they're terrific.
As we do every year for our "Must Mode" issue, your ideas, your picks, your lists will be considered for inclusion.<eos> Nico, I told you, only emergencies.<eos> No, you cannot submit my apartment for "Pimp Yo House."<eos> Good-bye.<eos> Family is staying with me temporarily.<eos> Remember, it's not just an "it" list.<eos> There are personal "musts" as well.<eos> Like must be on time.<eos> For others, it's a bit more profound.<eos> What's important is that we tap into the issues of our readers' lives they cannot face, move them to the next stage in their lives, promise them it won't be another year full of unanswered questions and unresolved issues,
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout!<eos> Y'all ain't ready!<eos> Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about, baby.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Get 'em out of here, guys!<eos> Guys, get 'em the hell out of here!<eos> Come on. Let's go.<eos> Let's put our heads together right now.<eos> We knew this is what was coming.<eos> And we knew this is what they were gonna bring.
Slow down.<eos> We can think of a better way.<eos> It's too late.<eos> Even if you get the generator, it won't end there.<eos> You push my father, Jake, he'll push back.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> - I've got Jonah.<eos> - What about those pallets?<eos> - I don't see them.<eos> - Maybe they're gone already.
You guys, I crapped my pants!<eos> You guys!<eos> You guys, check it out!<eos> Satan, I must speak with thee.<eos> - What is it?<eos> You've invited so many celebrities on Earth to your party that people in Hell can't get wristbands.<eos> Well I have to invite celebrities or else my party won't be cool.<eos> Satan, I warn thee, do not throw this party at the cost of alienating your friends.<eos> I'm not alienating my friends!<eos> I know they come first!
They're not children.<eos> They know what to do.<eos> Let's go.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I've got her.<eos> Owen, I want to do it on my own.<eos> Look, I'm sorry about your friends.<eos> You know, I never liked camping.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> They took the guns.
If you can believe it, on the verge of going supernova.<eos> When?<eos> It could be tomorrow, it could be next year.<eos> There's no way of knowing for sure, sir.<eos> When it does happen, the only warning that we're likely to get is a fast helium flash, at which point we'll have to jump out of here before it obliterates the entire planetary system.<eos> Sir, I'm not one to look for religious signs, but I can't get my head around these odds. That human and Cylon both converge on this planet at this exact moment, just as the star is about to go supernova?<eos> I'm not a religious person, Mr. Gaeta, as you both know.<eos> So if this is the work of a higher power, then they have one hell of a sense of humor.<eos> We have a stand-off. Very predictable.<eos> They have the Eye, and they'll nuke it if we try to take it, and we'll shoot them down if they try bringing it up to Galactica.
Once we get through the star cluster, you will all be returned to your designated ships...<eos> Sasha.<eos> My name isn't Sasha.<eos> My name's Captain Louanne Katraine. You understand me?<eos> Sasha, and you, were a lifetime ago.<eos> Right.<eos> Right, because you have this now, right?<eos> No more hanging with the sinners?<eos> Stay away from me. Do you understand me?<eos> Do they even know who you really are?
What else did we get?<eos> Well...<eos> I found these hairs that were too long for a military haircut, so I ran them domestically for DNA.<eos> Brad Hoffman.<eos> You know him?<eos> I'm about to.<eos> I've never been to Iraq.<eos> I know Patrick from Miami.<eos> I grew up with both brothers.<eos> In fact, they were going to work for my company when they got back from there.
Lakshmi and Rishad Batra?<eos> It's not Matthew.<eos> No, but those are his parents.<eos> Does it list their occupation?<eos> They're pathologists.<eos> Does that mean anything to you?<eos> Pickled body parts.<eos> Means they use formaldehyde.<eos> My parents are good people, okay.<eos> Only reason why they're on that list is where they were born.
I mean, spectacular.<eos> Sorry, real Dan, you lose.<eos> Uh, real Dan's with me.<eos> Right, I gotta go.<eos> All right, how 'bout this?<eos> Um...uh, I was thinking maybe your green sweater? No.<eos> You're going to a bar.<eos> You gotta give him a little something to look at.<eos> Unleash the hounds!<eos> They have been kinda cooped up lately.
It was changes in hereditary traits that allowed the first mammals to breath in the air.<eos> Retarded fish-frogs.<eos> Ms. Garrision, I believe that's a gross over-simplification.<eos> Well, you're a faggot! Continue.<eos> You see, children, life has the amazing ability to change, to adapt.<eos> Like changing us to the point that we walk upright.<eos> So you are saying that we're all related to monkeys.<eos> Well yes, basically, we are.<eos> Do you see monkeys at the zoo? !<eos> They crap in their hands and throw it at people!
I know that it revolves around the 10.<eos> But it's more like play the 10th symphony, and the one that I found wasn't even finished.<eos> No, no.<eos> I can make this work.<eos> This I can make work.<eos> Sure, I would have loved having this information before I promised sexual favors to a very unappealing woman at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but maybe your problem is actually your solution.<eos> "The Curse of the Ninth."<eos> All the great composers died after completing their ninth symphony.<eos> You're talking Beethoven, Mahler, Bruckner.<eos> They all croaked halfway through their 10th.
But look at you.<eos> I mean, your kids don't even go here anymore.<eos> Right.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> The boys went to Mexico without asking us.<eos> - I'm sure they're fine.<eos> But... - Wait, Seth went too?<eos> Why...?<eos> I mean, he just doesn't seem like Mr. Donkey Show.<eos> Not that they're at a donkey show. Or even know what a donkey show is...
What's Crab Man doing here in his PJs ?<eos> Oh, he's in the witness protection program and Joy found out because of the letter I delivered.<eos> And Darnell wouldn't tell Joy why he's in the program, so Joy threw him out.<eos> And I told him he could live here.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> I'll ask for extra towels tomorrow.<eos> Good night, Crab Man.<eos> Good night, Earl.<eos> - Is it the witness protectors ?<eos> - No, they're very polite.
Oliver North.<eos> And you think, 15 years from now, my name will be part of this conversation?<eos> I'm still working on the added value of Communist ice skaters, but he's making a good point.<eos> They're fetishizing that I worship.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well... okay...<eos> They're exploiting me, and I'm exploiting them.<eos> Well, they're getting the better end of the deal.<eos> Why?<eos> Because they're enhancing themselves and you're diminishing yourself.
- I'm clean now.<eos> - Good for you.<eos> It's too late.<eos> My wife, my kids moved away as far as they could.<eos> I m-m...<eos> I messed up so much.<eos> I missed so much when I was high.<eos> This is where they live.<eos> Oliver's 11 now, and Julia is nine.<eos> They've gone so many years without hearing from me on Christmas... Mr. Taylor, I fully expect this surgery to be a success.
- Prison.<eos> - Prison?<eos> He murdered his wife and his three colleagues.<eos> A theologian who commits murder.<eos> So much for the Sixth Commandment.<eos> Dr. Hensleigh is on death row.<eos> His execution date is set... for five days from today.<eos> Obviously, the stress of Sara's disappearance has been very hard on you.<eos> Tell the kidnappers to give Sara back or I'll tell everyone about us.<eos> Well, they'll just say you're a... a spoiled teenager desperate for attention.
Just say you'll go away with me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> No rush. Mrs. Chase.<eos> Nice-Iooking lady.<eos> Vinnie.<eos> To what do I owe this?<eos> Where they make deals?<eos> Well the Fitzpatrick boys have me on retainer.<eos> I practically have an office down there.<eos> And they got this crazy idea that little Miss Kendall Casablancas owes them money and that you know where the money's hidden.
What are you doing Christmas Eve?<eos> We could go carol singing.<eos> I'm sorry, love, but I'll be getting hammered.<eos> -Where are your families?<eos> -No idea. We grew up in care.<eos> Like a children's home?<eos> -I haven't got anyone else, either.<eos> -What happened to you?<eos> My parents are dead, so I came down here to start afresh.<eos> So they didn't leave you a house or anything?
We're this close...<eos> I just drove us 99 yards down the field.<eos> Take it the last yard.<eos> Put it in the damn house!<eos> THE CHRISTMAS SHOW<eos> It's strange that you're here.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Really?<eos> There are lots of men here.<eos> They're the fathers.
At the southern end of our planet, fiery ribbons are illuminating the winter skies.<eos> The aurora australis.<eos> This light brings no warmth to the male penguins, who are still huddling, defying the coldest conditions on the planet.<eos> Their ordeal is drawing to a close.<eos> Thirty days after it last set, the sun rises once more on Antarctica.<eos> Their appalling trials have all been for this.<eos> Each father has just one meal left inside him.<eos> He has been saving it all winter.<eos> This single feed will sustain the chicks for a few more days, but the males have not eaten for nearly four months.<eos> If they do not eat soon, they and their chicks will die.
It's the very essence of wilderness.<eos> With so few prey animals here, life for a hunter is particularly hard.<eos> Creatures are scarce because few can eat conifer needles.<eos> The moose is an exception.<eos> Growth is so difficult that conifers protect their precious leaves by filling them with resin.<eos> That reduces water loss, but it also makes them very distasteful.<eos> At least the conifer's seeds are edible but they're protected within armor plated cones and it takes a specialist to reach them.<eos> The crossbill's extraordinary beak can prise apart the scales, so that it's tongue can extract the seeds.<eos> Birds are fortunate.<eos> When the seasonal crop is gathered, they can fly south
The northern forest may be the largest on Earth but to see coniferous trees that have reached their full potential you must travel a thousand miles south of here.<eos> The Pacific Coast of North America.<eos> The land of hemlock, douglas fir and giant redwood.<eos> Here, water is never locked up in ice and even if rains fail the needles can extract moisture from the fogs that roll in from the sea.<eos> The Sun's energy powers these forests not for one month as it does in the Taiga but for half the year.<eos> These conifers grow at ten times the rate of those near the Arctic and they live for thousands of years.<eos> One grove of redwoods in California contains three of the tallest trees on Earth.<eos> This one is over a hundred meters high, the size of a thirty story building.<eos> These forests were growing here long before humans walked the Earth.<eos> They were in their prime twenty million years ago and existed before the Swiss Alps or the Rocky Mountains were even raised.
The air is heavy with the scent of females.<eos> The rules are simple.<eos> Winner takes all.<eos> Across the northern hemisphere the deciduous forests are changing.<eos> Leaves that have provided food and shelter since the spring, are now shed.<eos> In the broad leaf forests of Russia winter is particularly severe<eos> but there will always be some who benefit from hardship.<eos> Black vultures scavenge from the carcass of a seeker deer that has died of cold or starvation.<eos> These endangered birds are visitors.<eos> They've come down from the north to escape the even colder conditions in Siberia.
Here day length never changes but the dry season is so severe that the trees can't afford to loose the amount of water that would evaporate from their broad leaves, so the leaves must be shed.<eos> The forest resembles a European woodland in mid winter but the heat is overpowering, and it's inhabitants, unfamiliar.<eos> For the creatures of India's teak forests, these are desperate times but salvation is at hand.<eos> The mahwa tree is about to bloom.<eos> It's flowers are full of liquid making them irresistible.<eos> The mahwa is an oasis in a hot dry desert.<eos> Those that fly or climb are not the only ones to get a share.<eos> Chital deer follow the langur monkeys collecting the flowers that fall.<eos> The monkeys welcome the deer, for deer are unrivaled at spotting predators.<eos> If they are relaxed, it must be safe to come down to the ground and gather the food that lies there
High in the branches above, the baobab's nectar is starting to flow.<eos> A drink of this sugary energy packed liquid is an ideal way for the lemurs to start their day.<eos> Liquid oozes from the flower's center and trickles down the petals<eos> But the nectar is not intended for lemurs.<eos> These giant hawk moths are the drinkers the tree needs to attract.<eos> As they sip, moving from tree to tree, so they transfer pollen and fertilize the flowers.<eos> Nectar was an excellent first course for the lemurs but moths are the main dish.<eos> The moths are very important to the lemurs for they will replenish the fat reserves that the lemurs need to survive the barren dry season.<eos> The lemurs might seem to be a pest for the baobab.<eos> They kill it's pollinators and rob it of it's nectar but they do give something in return.
I look at you and I see all those politicians who've lied to me.<eos> I see the United Nations, US envoys.<eos> In East Africa, they lied about desert encroachment while whole villages died of starvation because their crops failed.<eos> Liars - every single one of them.<eos> And you're lying to me now.<eos> I'm not lying.<eos> You've seen the document.<eos> You see, that's the thing... . .I just don't believe you.<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> You're just like Rachel - you have such faith in people - but they're lying.
But you know what i think?<eos> - You gotta go with your gut.<eos> - Yeah,i guess you're right.<eos> You have to do what's right for you, Not what other people think is the right thing to do.<eos> It's just... sometimes it's hard to know the difference.<eos> It's almost impossible sometimes.<eos> Yeah,it's hard to hear your gut when everyone else is telling you what-<eos> You know,in alaska,some people kill their own turkeys.<eos> The pilgrims did not endure all their hardships so that we could shoot our own food.<eos> They struggled so that we could buy free-Range turkeys at citarella.
It's my turn to annoy you about the Icelandic police commissioner.<eos> Someone broke into Gentech's database.<eos> - I see.<eos> - It should be impossible.<eos> Nothing's impossible.<eos> I also saw a fax in his office.<eos> There's a high-level meeting between the American and Russian mafias.<eos> Between the top bosses, right?<eos> That's no secret.<eos> They know we monitor them.

It was a history that every child in the Dutch Republic would have known, as important to them as Boudicca is to us.<eos> The ancient Dutch, known as the Batavians, had their rebellion against the Romans, too.<eos> And their leader was called Claudius Civilis.<eos> The story goes like this.<eos> Claudius had been fighting on the side of the Romans against his own people.<eos> But, at some point, he has a change of heart.<eos> He decides there's been one tax too many, his country bled white.<eos> So he switches sides.<eos> He summons a meeting of tribal chiefs, declares a revolt and swears them to join him.<eos> They take the oath, the die is cast, blood happens.
-Give it to me. -[RJ] No, Verne.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> -Just trying to have a little...<eos> -"We're having Fun?"<eos> -That's not what it looks like.<eos> -A box oF boomerangs.<eos> He throws them, they come back, hit him and you Film it?<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You've turned into human beings.<eos> I've heard they hurt people and they Film it.
- There are people in the world who enjoy that kind of music, aren't there?<eos> This metallic music...<eos> It's not our thing at all, right?<eos> Apparently there's a special group which is black or really bad.<eos> I don't know much about it, but I've heard about it.<eos> And Christians... aren't for but against it.<eos> Especially the fact that they deny Jesus Christ and drag everything through the dirt and who knows what.<eos> Devil worshippers wear the cross upside down, don't they?<eos> It's devil...<eos> They turn it the other way round, right?

Is it enough?<eos> his mama wait until the people were here to all buy my ma's cattle they'll be killed to eat them all<eos> If you'd like, we can make a meal and then eat<eos> where'd you go?<eos> you never excite too dint of , do you also go together?<eos> Yes You shouldn't go do you think that you can get them with the come back come back come back I must go<eos> I must say this is a bad spirit Then we can kill our cows We can also kill him good...kind of, otherwise we will starve<eos> if I do not return, you take the son to<eos> the fire cloud thief thank you hello everyone.<eos> no one sees his true character know that he robs the herd of cattle then divides them to the poor farmer Everyone is very afraid of those robbers because if they return there is no one The fire cloud steals...he uses a kind of power as
I remember nothing afterwards.<eos> I ran through the woods.<eos> I reached a kind of bay.<eos> Three young boys.<eos> The boys with motorcycles.<eos> Sitting by the fire, bikes with them.<eos> I sat with them and drank wine.<eos> Not remember anything else again.<eos> And then I remember fuck all three.<eos> You know, they raped me.
We have to get our hands on it somehow.<eos> And I've got a sure-fire plan.<eos> We knock off a beverage market.<eos> It's so simple and so elegant, it can't go wrong.<eos> Prison was full of geniuses with sure-fire plans.<eos> The place is owned by two brothers.<eos> They have a back room.<eos> They keep the week's earnings there, including the previous weekend's take.<eos> They sort the cash by denomination and walk it over to the bank.<eos> And they don't carry guns?
Polly, check the fries, please.<eos> - Yes.<eos> So, that'll be 8. 50, please.<eos> Keep the change.<eos> Have a nice day!<eos> Breakfast!<eos> Breakfast!<eos> That's your character!<eos> The eggs, bacon, croissants and all the rest.<eos> They are your thought patterns and shit.
I recall a particular mass.<eos> He told us how Jonah, who had disobeyed the Almighty command, had sailed as a stowaway aboard a ship. Then there was a great storm. The<eos> Captain found out there was a sinner on board.<eos> The priest said: I don't know if he tortured him or what, but Jonah confessed immediately.<eos> So they threw him overboard.<eos> This was said by a priest to a congregation of prisoners.<eos> This is the little chalice that the Pallarolls family made for me so that I could conduct mass.<eos> I was forbidden by the guards from conducting mass. They said I was a criminal and no longer part of the church.<eos> So I was using a Coca Cola cap.<eos> When they found out, they said they'd make one for me.
I think absolutely.<eos> Snowboarders seem to be a little wilder and take up more room.<eos> We were standing in line and three of them cut in front of us.<eos> We just didn't want to bug with them because we thought they might have guns or something.<eos> And I think, as I look back in my career, when it was really a bad boy image, snowboarders, I must admit, deserved some of the criticism they were getting.<eos> They're looking down at you, and you like that, though, when you're a kid.<eos> "Yeah, I'm a scumbag.<eos> I'm riding a snowboard."<eos> What it did is gave you that angst and that energy to go out and prove them wrong.<eos> You know, prove to them that you could go out and enjoy it just as much or more than they could.
but I couldn't get an apprenticeship.<eos> I failed everywhere.<eos> I may be a dead loss...<eos> But even so,<eos> I was useful for the first time.<eos> Under the bombs, amid the wounded... holding a pregnant woman's hand reassured her.<eos> Japanese candy... made the children so happy.<eos> They'd crowd around me.<eos> "Yuko" here, "Yuko" there...<eos> They'd kiss me.
I'm sorry, sir.<eos> I'm positive your school records are false. You must've cheated!<eos> Don't say that, sir.<eos> I'm just not good at adjusting, but...<eos> So what exactly do you need to adjust?<eos> Your file says that you're under the custody of your uncle, right?<eos> What?<eos> Yes... sir.<eos> And your parents?<eos> They passed away.
There was a time when I dreamed about being a police officer...<eos> So I know how this works.<eos> Take it back now, or I'll have to report this to the police.<eos> You're violating Para 1, Art. 133 of the Criminal code.<eos> Do you really know what's going on with her at school?<eos> She's been involved in gang fights, and beaten the leader to a pulp!<eos> What?<eos> Yourjob was to watch and befriend her, instead, what do you do?<eos> Your old habits just came right out!<eos> But they wouldn't leave me alone.
Saves time in the morning, stupid.<eos> Good morning, Kisaragi.<eos> Morning.<eos> I'm starved.<eos> What's the deal with those FTG guys?<eos> What about the FTG?<eos> There's a guard outside their gear locker.<eos> A guard?<eos> Since when do we need 14 guys observing exercises, anyway?<eos> Guess it means they're going to be riding us hard this time.
Then, what about Kikumasa?<eos> I was the real target.<eos> That's enough.<eos> I know everything.<eos> I know you're an agent for someone named Yeung Fan.<eos> It's over.<eos> Give it up.<eos> Those FTG men are really from DAIS.<eos> They're here to stop you.<eos> They aren't DAIS.
Can't see a thing.<eos> Can't we get satellite imagery?<eos> Yes, in daylight.<eos> But it won't be in position 'till well after sunrise.<eos> Never mind that now.<eos> I want to know who the hell these people are!<eos> Get on with it!<eos> Commander Hirotaka Miyatsu and 19 commissioned officers are still on board.<eos> Furthermore, we know that 14 men boarded at Yura.<eos> They were posing as FTG staff.

I have been singing for 72 years now.<eos> Me and my voice are 86 years old.<eos> I am a woman of Istanbul.<eos> I was born in Bursa and i have been living in Ouskountar since i was 10.<eos> I have been singing since i was a child in Bursa.<eos> But i couldn't talk till i became 10.<eos> I was stuttering.<eos> I had to talk fast, so that no one understands what i was saying.<eos> Stutters can sing, but they can't talk.<eos> They used to call me Mouzegien Senar but they have forgotten me.
The mocking laughter.<eos> Do you think he accepts his fate?<eos> That's it.<eos> Whatever will be will be'.<eos> Try to get into... Into his mind, into his thoughts.<eos> Who wants to imagine what's going through his head?<eos> Yes, Gal.<eos> He may think he'd better commit suicide than be defeated by the enemies who tortured him.<eos> Moreover, committing suicide means that he can control how he dies.<eos> If they kill him no one else will be hurt.

"Oh God, God.<eos> How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable seem to me... all the uses of this world. "<eos> Hamlet.<eos> Yes.<eos> Excuse me, Mary.<eos> So, what's up, Emerson?<eos> Well.<eos> I haven't given it to anyone else to read.<eos> Not even your parents?<eos> They just tell me how great it is.
Saved by the Spanokapita.<eos> So thanks, thanks for a...<eos> no, no, it's a good question.<eos> Really. So, I 'm glad we had a chance...<eos> I really like the Ostrakoi in your book.<eos> They're so wise, mysterious.<eos> Probably you noticed, but I made that name up from the Ostrakon.<eos> No, that went right by me.<eos> The Ostrakon... refresh my memory?<eos> Those tablets the ancient Greeks used... to exile citizens if they were too powerful or smart.
Good question.<eos> So your parents aren't here?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Do you want me to wait?<eos> So you don't know where your parents are?<eos> - Check it out.<eos> - Emerson, no!<eos> - My parents let me.<eos> - No.<eos> - Seriously, they do. - No.
Emerson, I don't think so.<eos> What, now minors aren't allowed to take saunas?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know what, I better go.<eos> Hey, Emerson. Emerson.<eos> Emerson.<eos> Emerson, give me my keys, now.<eos> Here's your drink.<eos> What would your parents think?<eos> They'd think you're being pretty up tight.
Yes, sir.<eos> After leaving the tavern, the captain went to sleep.<eos> At dawn...it was close to dawn.<eos> From the corpse's rigid condition, it seems JANG Hak-soo was killed a couple hours past midnight.<eos> If the sailor's words are true, then he cannot be the criminal.<eos> This is Doctor NAM.<eos> This is Doo-ho, a paper mill dyer.<eos> He will draw the autopsy illustration.<eos> And those men...?<eos> - They will perform the autopsy.
StarHub is unable to get a response from our customer's mobile phone.<eos> Please try again later.<eos> Get out!<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> ...may perish from all sorts of hurt.<eos> Love disappears only when you do not understand what it means.<eos> I was born July 9, 1943, in Sago Lane.<eos> I was a cute and happy baby.<eos> But had my parents known what was in store for me, they would probably have given me away for adoption.
My mother thought it was only a small boil which had burst open.<eos> The next morning I lost my hearing.<eos> She shouted into my ears, but I couldn't make out what she was saying.<eos> How much pain and suffering can a person take?<eos> I have often wrestled with that question.<eos> I've lost my hearing, and now I'm about to lose my sight as well.<eos> It all started with the right eye.<eos> I saw changing colors and black dots and I kept blinking.<eos> My parents did not take me immediately to the hospital for treatment.<eos> They just gave me eye drops and Chinese herbs.

That Jesus was an actial person. - All right. That He was a teacher with a large following.<eos> And we know that the Romans executed Him. Which brings us to the Ressurection.<eos> What happened next?<eos> According to the disciples, Jesus rose from the dead. But of course they would say that.<eos> Why?<eos> Is that what they were expecting to happen?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> - The answer is no, they weren't.<eos> Even though I told them several times it was going to happen, they still didn't believe until they saw me in person.<eos> Isn't it possible that they only thought Jesus had died?
As far as the briefers in Saigon, there were no American troops along the border.<eos> Does anybody know what we're fighting for?<eos> Do you believe we're fighting for democracy here?<eos> Actually, I'll tell you, the only thing you're fighting for is your own life.<eos> You're fighting to go back home.<eos> The North Vietnamese, they had two regiments, two crack regiments, totally surrounding the fire base.<eos> And it's plain suicide going out there in the middle of the night.<eos> There's a thing about giving an order, and there's a thing about using your head, too.<eos> It's always the higher-highers, man.<eos> They don't have to go out there. They can send us out there.
Now there are more deaths.<eos> I look for my customers.<eos> I take my case and sit close to the Sheraton Hotel where the foreigners and journalists are.<eos> If it rains, I go somewhere else. If it doesn't, I stay.<eos> I sit there, just passing time.<eos> When I work here I hear explosions gunfights and shooting.<eos> It always happens.<eos> When there is a shootout, I hide.<eos> I look for a good hiding place until it's over.<eos> I am scared of the soldiers. And they are also afraid.
I'm the calmest person here!<eos> Rubbish!<eos> I haven't even joined in this argument. Well hardly.<eos> OK, we'll leave the car somewhere. Anywhere.<eos> The police will fýnd it whatever.<eos> Just get the keys.<eos> Then we have the gangsters after us.<eos> They have Umut's number!<eos> In the end, we're stealing their car.<eos> And they stole it from someone else.
Why did you make me so beautiful?<eos> Don't worry Poori.<eos> Your parents are worried unnecessarily.<eos> You're not so beautiful.<eos> Your eyes aren't so big.<eos> Your nose is dented as if punched by someone.<eos> You're not so fair.<eos> Then, why should they worry?<eos> You mean, I'm not beautiful.<eos> You think you look beautiful, because they say so.
Must be dealt very carefully.<eos> Would 2 or 3 days be enough for you to investigate?<eos> I need 4 or 5 days to read this.<eos> If you need 4 or 5 days to read this, how many days will you need to understand what you read, how many days will you need to investigate what you understood, and how many years will you need to prepare the investigation report?<eos> I'm not trying to confuse you.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> What is it dear?<eos> Kamal Hasan's first wife's name?<eos> I'm sending 2 men.<eos> They'll tell you.
When Despina takes charge, things don't go wrong.<eos> I've led thousands of men by the nose. I can manage two women.<eos> Are they rich, these two gentlemen?<eos> - Very rich!<eos> - Where are they?<eos> Outside, waiting for me.<eos> Go now and bring them to me by the side entrance.<eos> I'll be waiting for you in my room.<eos> Provided you do everything I tell you, before tomorrow your friends will taste victory.<eos> They'll get the pleasure and I'll get the glory!
- No, just outside.<eos> From Hønefoss.<eos> - I thought I recognized your accent.<eos> - Really?<eos> - But you're from Oslo.<eos> - Hardly!<eos> I was born in Buenos Aires, but grew up in...<eos> Ngobo.<eos> On the Kenyan-Tanzanian border. My parents were missionaries.<eos> - They were from Oslo.
They would say: "Well, you know we have no overtime. There is to be no overtime whatsoever."<eos> We may have five baskets of merchandise that needs to be put back. You may have 30 minutes left on your 8-hour shift. "But we need those baskets put away." And they usually do it with a smile.<eos> You would go along with it because you needed that job.<eos> And there was no if, ands, or buts about it.<eos> They would let you know, one way or the other: "If you can't do it, I'll just get somebody else to do it.<eos> "You are not a person that cannot be replaced.<eos> And we're hiring all the time."<eos> And in your mind, you go: "Look, I got these kids at home.<eos> I'll just have to make that sacrifice." And you will.<eos> They are asked to work off the clock with the implication that if they don't work off the clock, that is what is expected at this particular store, they are gonna lose their job.
Now I have realized the difference between the truth and deceit.<eos> Now I have realized the difference between the truth and deceit.<eos> From now I shall live life on my terms.<eos> From now I shall live life on my terms.<eos> Now all of you listen to me.<eos> Let's go back to Rishivan. ls this the way to live?<eos> What has it got for you?<eos> You will not get anything in this living hell!<eos> Only give way to the false promises of ministers.<eos> They will never give you houses.
- What're you worried about?<eos> Listen<eos> A boar shows up, you grab his neck with your left hand Hit him in the eye three times with your right Then his eye's will turn all black<eos> He goes home like that and tells his friends Don't go to Dongmakgol!<eos> It's an awful place.<eos> Then they'll never come back!<eos> If it were you, got hit thrice in the eye, what would you do?<eos> Take all the boys back with me!<eos> Then...then we shouldn't hit them!<eos> If they all come back, we can't get all those eyes.
You told that you had some things you couldn't say to Deniz.<eos> I have some things I couldn't say to you, as well.<eos> I am not good at making a speech.<eos> You are my son my everything.<eos> That's all I am saying.<eos> I understood, dad.<eos> I understood very well, thank you.<eos> You said once, "I wish he didn't see me in bed like this".<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Sons remember their dads just the way they want right, Sadýk?
Not as sorry as I am.<eos> *********** but the sooner we get done here, the sooner we can all go home.<eos> why?<eos> So my little tripper can run out to greet me?<eos> Barbara.<eos> I'm sorry about your cat, ma'am.<eos> We lost an officer.<eos> How much did you love her?<eos> Barbara, please.<eos> When my guys went to your house, they said you were a little out of it, but you're thinking clearly now, right?
What he cared about in this life was... his wife, his trains, and his kids.<eos> In that order.<eos> Kids?<eos> You're an only child.<eos> Again, if only.<eos> If you're looking for a love connection, then... then you should maybe go talk to one of the chosen ones.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Fosters.<eos> My parents had, like...dozens.<eos> They'd come and go, some before I was born.
My Louise!<eos> It's me, Jean-Marc!<eos> "You're not dreaming.<eos> "l wanted you to know I'm fine,<eos> "that I'm waiting for you in the utmost peace."<eos> She goes on to say this happens every day.<eos> Sometimes, she calls, and he answers.<eos> - Think it's true?<eos> - Why shouldn't it be?<eos> I think the dead are somewhere, that they live somewhere, and sometimes make contact with us.
And here we are starving.<eos> Children are less affected because we goat milk for them.<eos> Without it, we starving.<eos> This kid bleats because his mother had a baby.<eos> As he drank all the milk Ie small starving.<eos> So they put him in the barn.<eos> That way, she has milk. And it is free to frolic.<eos> I am illiterate.<eos> Our children go to school I will not go.<eos> I'm glad they study for not staying arrant asses like me.
"Are you allowed to publish books?"<eos> The third level was,<eos> "Are you allowed to get a job at all in your domain?"<eos> And the fourth level is, you are arrested or whatever, no?<eos> I was between the second and third.<eos> My God, I was unemployed.<eos> It was humiliating.<eos> I was 27, and my parents supported me, my God.<eos> Then for two years, it was that humiliating job at the central committee.<eos> They knew that I am not an idiot and that I will probably succeed.

Maxi, leave that.<eos> The dirt is so thick potatoes would grow on it.<eos> Have you cleaned your own house?<eos> Of course, or my pa would get mad.<eos> Does he hit you?<eos> No.<eos> Just a little smack when I've been bad.<eos> What about your brothers?<eos> Are they good to you?<eos> They always tease me but they're cool.
California Youth Authority.<eos> Some pretty hard cases come out of there.<eos> What did he want with her?<eos> Did he mention a man named Steve Trevor?<eos> No.<eos> When I release you, you'll forget what I've asked you... and everything that you've told me.<eos> That's terrific.<eos> I can't think of an encore, but I'd like to be around when you do it.<eos> Shouldn't those guys hit the slammer?<eos> They're not important.
Are you being funny?<eos> This news is a bit funny.<eos> Errera's been dead and buried for one year.<eos> His wife requested him to be buried in our cemetery.<eos> - He died a year ago?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You're sure?<eos> - Positive.<eos> You should get rid of his file then!<eos> We informed the police records department, but they haven't done their job!
Human behavior.<eos> That's what I like.<eos> Humans do some really interesting things.<eos> Like besides killing ourselves, we also kill each other.<eos> Murder.<eos> And we're the only ones who do that, by the way.<eos> We're the only species on earth that deliberately kills members of our own species for personal gain or pleasure, sometimes it's just fun.<eos> We're also the only species that deliberately kills members of another species for personal gain or pleasure.<eos> That's what hunters do.<eos> They kill for pleasure.
Medgar Evers, Malcolm X. John Lennon.<eos> They all said, try to live together peacefully.<eos> Bam.<eos> Right in the fucking head.<eos> Apparently, we're not ready for that.<eos> Yeah. That's difficult behavior for us.<eos> We're too busy sitting around trying to think up ways to kill each other.<eos> Here's one we came up with, it's efficient. Too.<eos> Genocide.<eos> You know, killing large numbers of people simply because they don't look like you, they don't talk like you and they don't have the same kind of hats you do.
You don't.<eos> You have no choice.<eos> You have owners.<eos> They own you.<eos> They own everything.<eos> They own all the important land.<eos> They own and control the corporations.<eos> They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, and city halls.<eos> They got the judges in their back pocket.<eos> And they own all the big media companies so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
They would go for it.<eos> Listen, young people are attracted to suicide in the first place.<eos> Did you know suicide is the third leading cause of death between 15 and 24?<eos> It's third.<eos> Ninth in the general population.<eos> That will give you an idea of how popular this after school activity has become among our teenage folks.<eos> Especially these young boys, these adolescent males.<eos> And a lot of them you know, a lot of them.<eos> They kill themselves when they're jerking off.<eos> They don't mean to.
I don't know if you remember that but from that old incident some years back,<eos> Judas Priest.<eos> One of the head banging bands, somebody played a song and after that they killed themselves so they blamed suicide on heavy metal.<eos> If it's murder.<eos> They tend blame rap these days.<eos> But it's never the parents.<eos> Did you ever notice this?<eos> Parents apparently play no part in the development and outcomes of these kids.<eos> Parents.<eos> You know they can raise a kid apparently 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 years.
"Must be those kids at the parking lot he hangs around with."<eos> Parents got to be among the most full of shit people in the world.<eos> Well, they always have been.<eos> Top to bottom, front to back.<eos> Listen. In fairness.<eos> It comes with the job.<eos> If you want to be a parent, you got to be full of shit at least half the time.<eos> Look at it this way, they have it both ways.<eos> If the kid turns out to be a loser.<eos> They had nothing to do with that.
Porky Pig, Hitler,<eos> Janis Joplin, Alan Ludden my Uncle Dave, your Uncle Dave.<eos> Everybody's Uncle Dave.<eos> An endless stream of dead Uncle Dave's falling through the crack.<eos> And all the dead Uncle Dave's gather around a heavenly kitchen table.<eos> They light up cigarettes and they begin to talk.<eos> They talk about how they never got a break.<eos> How their parents didn't love them.<eos> And their children were ungrateful.<eos> They talk about how the government screwed them out of money and they just missed out on a big job.
- It cannot be!<eos> - What did you do to Seiya?<eos> As I just told you, I have taken care of him.<eos> I threw Pegasus into the frozen hell of Cocito.<eos> The place where those end that committed the most terrible sind against the gods.<eos> We cannot forgive anyone who plots against our lord Hades.<eos> - What are you saying?<eos> - Seiya is ...<eos> At least this way, the sacrifice of our fellows will not be in vain.<eos> They fought until the end to reach our common goal.
Germany lost the war.<eos> We can't complain even if we lose our territory.<eos> We didn't lose!<eos> The Communist Party and the Jews were the ones that quit.<eos> Noa, please get me my coat.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Don't be with people like her!<eos> Whats wrong about that?<eos> Gypsies are just like the Jews.<eos> They don t even have their own country and they come into Germany. stealing our money, our jobs and our country!

Gitana, Nomad, they can call me whatever they like.
We have what we call "arrastão", which is dragging the fishing net... taking it out of the water.<eos> This is what I do, all day long.<eos> You pull the net out, correct?<eos> wedding DAY<eos> In February 1 964, Vlado marries Clarice... a girl he met at Philosophy College of the University of São Paulo.<eos> Their wedding was taped by a cameraman of TV Excelsior.<eos> On the tape, we can see many friends... and some will be participating in this film, like Fernando Jordão... Fátima, and also the Argentine moviemaker Fernando Birri... whose proposition of a movie's movement... defending critical and poetic documentaries has influenced us.<eos> We founded what would later become the Documentary School of Santa Fé... which was originally called Cinematography Institute... for the National University of the Coast.<eos> Some time later at the school... we saw two young men arrive... with a small suitcase in their hands.<eos> I opened the door... and they kindly and naively asked:
We would like you to come with us."<eos> Carmen was with a friend of ours upstairs.<eos> I called her, she came down, and I said:<eos> "These gentlemen here are taking me under arrest."<eos> "No, that's not it.<eos> You're just going to be interrogated."<eos> They rang the bell, I opened the door and saw two big guys.<eos> To me, they looked much bigger than they probably were.<eos> I excused myself and changed because I was in my pajamas.<eos> They let me change.
This book is a dossier with the dead and the missing people... and here we see pictures that make us feel ashamed of ourselves.<eos> Still today, they make us cry.<eos> VLADO'S ARREST<eos> I was home, and two guys looking like cops arrived.<eos> They asked me something stupid... they said they wanted Vlado to take pictures of a wedding.<eos> I said he was not a photographer, he didn't do free-lance. "Where is he?"<eos> "At work, at TV Educativa." They asked for the address.<eos> "l don't know the address.<eos> I know how to get there, though."<eos> "Don't worry, we'll find it." They left, I called Vlado.

They left, I called Vlado.<eos> He was going in the studio to put the news on the air.<eos> It was the last newscast he put on the air.<eos> I said: "They're going over there.
And third, Vlado was a KGB agent... and that's why he had committed suicide.<eos> "You have to understand... that whoever comes here gets spanked!<eos> We don't care if it is the President!<eos> They're here, they get it!"<eos> There was something involving Geisel and Sílvio Frota, and Ednardo... the 2nd Base commander, could not control that... and the process of political opening was bothering him.<eos> We started seeing that conflict more clearly later.<eos> That's when I started to understand it was a fight... between two elephants.<eos> As the Indians used to say:<eos> "When two elephants are fighting... the grass takes the blunt." We were the grass.<eos> They stomped us.
They took Vlado to get to you... and they'd take you to get to me...", Paulo Egídio said:<eos> "...and they'd take me to get to the President."<eos> THE CEREMONY<eos> I was at ltaici, in a bishop conference... and I presided it... so they called me there about wanting to have... a religious ceremony, if possible... something in joint-work... with the Jewish community... and if I agreed that they did it at the Cathedral.<eos> The hours before the ecumenical ceremony... that took place on October 31 st... were of total suspense... total...<eos> It's hard to find the words.<eos> Of total tension... of not being able to feel the ground beneath your feet.<eos> I was threatened.<eos> Two generals from the administration came here... to try and convince that I didn't belong in the Cathedral.<eos> They said:
At least I have become in a lawyer Economist of success with clients in the best circles.<eos> Oh, Till, you are a cynic.<eos> Is it the pena, Johanna?<eos> The calumias of ti in the newspapers...<eos> Do not worry.<eos> I am hard to hurt.<eos> Politics is a dirty business!<eos> They now use the "outing" to force you to go back and you come to agreements.<eos> Si, I guess.<eos> Now my friends in "Galaxy" will try to use of any modo, Although they have not started.
They want our bodies. And they're going to get them.<eos> - What the-- - [laughing]<eos> Shen!<eos> These guys ain't that tough.<eos> [laughing] Shen!<eos> Sorry, boss.<eos> I wasn't fast enough.<eos> Not your fault.<eos> They turn us on ourselves.<eos> If they don't kill us all, we will kill ourselves.
- Well...<eos> - l'm...<eos> - You go ahead<eos> - No, you can speak first.<eos> You know, my dad wants to meet you.<eos> No need to feel uncomfortable about it.<eos> He does?<eos> That's wonderful!<eos> Since you've mentioned it, I told my parents about you and they're dying to meet you.<eos> If it's okay with you, they're thinking of visiting Korea to see you.
He does?<eos> That's wonderful!<eos> Since you've mentioned it, I told my parents about you and they're dying to meet you.<eos> If it's okay with you, they're thinking of visiting Korea to see you.<eos> No, we should go and visit them.<eos> How about we go next week during the holiday?<eos> Sure.<eos> This may sound really corny, but my parents want us to go to a fortune-teller.<eos> That's not corny at all.<eos> Listen to the elders and you'll be rewarded even in your sleep, they say.
May Your Majesty reconsider.<eos> Cheo-seon!<eos> Am I King or not?<eos> Am I still King when my dead father still rules, huh?<eos> Your Majesty, calm yourself.<eos> The prudent hunter treads silently to capture the prey.<eos> So, the ministers want us out?<eos> But the King told us to stay.<eos> Wasn't that by a Royal order?<eos> They see you as vermin, to be gotten rid of as soon as possible.
So why not the ministers?<eos> So we're allowed to satirize them too?<eos> Then help me set up an audition for more minstrels.<eos> Clothes define the man!<eos> Ladies!<eos> Get in line!<eos> Are we to make fun of the ministers or make them laugh?<eos> Both.<eos> We fooled with the King and he laughed, right?<eos> So if we fool with the ministers, they'll laugh too.
Please forgive me for the silence between us has been unbroken for one year<eos> This letter breaks that silence<eos> It marks the first of my three hundred and sixty five letters to you<eos> One for each day of silence<eos> I will never be more myself, than in these letters<eos> They are my maps of the bird path<eos> And they are all that I know to be true<eos> You will remember everything All will be as before<eos> In the begining of time, the skies were filled with flying elephants<eos> Every night they lay down in the same place in the sky
Sailing on the Nile<eos> Ascending the steps of ****** *****<eos> I remember wandering through the corridors of Hatshepsut and the faces of many women<eos> Endless seas and thousands of miles of rivers ...I remember father to children...<eos> ...And the taste... I remember... ...and the pealing of the peach...<eos> I remember everything<eos> But I do not remember ever having loved<eos> remember your dreams remember your dreams<eos> remember your dreams remember<eos> The longer I watch the Savanna elephants, the more I listen, the more I open, they remind me of who I am
Staying in the hospital is troublesome.<eos> Rest your chin on it.<eos> The University Hospital is like a school as well.<eos> Similar to a student like yourself who is studying in school, doctors are learning everyday.<eos> They are learning?<eos> Yes, and they can help you.<eos> They do research on medicine.<eos> Some patients come here especially when they find out our doctors specialize in research for this disease.<eos> Patients are books for doctors and they learn how to cure them.<eos> You said that they specialize in research?
God works in mysterious ways.<eos> Cardinal Campeggio tells me you want to stay in Rome now, and not return to England.<eos> Is that correct?<eos> Yes, holy father.<eos> I would rather remain with the flock of the faithful.<eos> Recently, master Brereton,<eos> I have ordained a new and very special holy order.<eos> They are the militantis ecclesiae.<eos> the soldiers of christ.<eos> These jesuits, as they are called, these soldiers, will go where others fear, where often they will meet great danger, in order to promote the catholic faith and take the word of god to heathens and heretics.
Not at all.<eos> Oh, what about mackerel today?<eos> That sounds good.<eos> It took a little longer, didn't it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Have you been practicing martial arts since you were little?<eos> Yes.<eos> I started getting serious... when I started training under Master Gouken.<eos> What about your parents?<eos> I heard they died.
Get me someone good this time.<eos> Spare no expense.<eos> Comrade, this is for you.<eos> This piece of shit is the enemy. I told him not to injure the people anymore. But instead, he stole their buffaloes.<eos> And guess what?<eos> He's a cop.<eos> Once in range, are you sure you can kill him?<eos> If I'm going to kill this man, I must know the reason first. To show strength, you must do as they do.<eos> Only do it harder than they can imagine. I'll need reconfirmation before doing this job.<eos> You'll get all the details as soon as they're gathered.
It will reflect on me too.<eos> When will you quit smoking?<eos> Before we talk, will you pick up that cigarette butt?<eos> Things have escalated. We have to make an example out of someone.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Kamnan Buem.<eos> That's not so easy. Is there any kind of insurance to back me up?<eos> Don't worry. That's our policy. The orders have come from high up.<eos> Do you think I would act without any form of backing?<eos> We're not like politicians. They come and go.

A 4400 serial killer was bad enough.<eos> But a 4400 child molester?<eos> You're damn right we don't want her back!<eos> Not now. Not ever.<eos> Look.<eos> I don't know what's going to happen with ms.<eos> Tobey. She's out on bail. Right?<eos> That's right.<eos> And her bond was paid by parents from this school.<eos> Yeah. And if they're not worried about their kids. Then we'll worry for them.
'Cause I really think you owe me an explanation.<eos> You know. Those guys wanted to kill me. And I turn around.<eos> And my cousin's nowhere in sight. I don't know what happened.<eos> Yeah. I know what happened... you ran out on me.<eos> It's a good thing that security guard was there.<eos> The other time.<eos> I could blame it on the beer. You drink too much. You can black out.<eos> Right? But today. I didn't drink anything.<eos> I'm blacking out. losing chunks of time.<eos> It's like they did something to my wiring.
We're not even talking about a murderer.<eos> We're talking about genocide, Dian<eos> Maybe the future doesn't have a problem with that.<eos> But I do. So if I don't believe that the world is better off with a bullet in this guy's head. I'm advocating genocide?<eos> No.<eos> There are people in rwanda right now who have lost mothers. Brothers. And children in that clinic.<eos> And he stood by. And he let it happen.<eos> That's just like our government.<eos> Just like governments all over the world.<eos> They all knew what was happening.
Or maybe she did nothing.<eos> Yeah."Nothing" would be my vote.<eos> A 4400 serial killer was bad enough.<eos> but a 4400 child molester?<eos> You're damn right we don't want her back!<eos> Not now.not ever.<eos> Look. I don't know what's going to happen with ms.Tobey.

Doesn't matter if one of them dies, or if a storm comes and washes away the anthill.<eos> They just keep working... Unless you take the queen away.<eos> Let's hope our drones respond the same way.<eos> Right, so the future sent back a schizophrenic queen ant with a blueprint for what, some interstellar walkie-talkie ?<eos> Let's see what Tess can tell us.<eos> We'd just better not get too close, because if your theory's right, anyone who gets exposed to her could be vulnerable.<eos> All right, I'll talk to Tess.<eos> You check in with Garrity at the hospital.<eos> These friends of yours, the ones who took you, what do you think they want to talk about ?<eos> They're so much smarter than you, it isn't even funny.

Go on.<eos> I really like hearing you talk about it.<eos> Our rooms had round windows.<eos> High doorways with arches in them.<eos> The stones had writing in them.<eos> Math symbols or something, inscriptions, jars of purplish metals, and rods with stained tips.<eos> These symbols, Tess, what did they look like ?<eos> Tess ?<eos> Tess, do you remember what the inscriptions said ?<eos> They're waiting to hear from me.
- No, it can't.<eos> I know what you're going through.<eos> You need to give yourself time.<eos> It can't wait.<eos> I'm held together by a string right now, Ms. Bristow.<eos> A week ago, I had a good job working for the CIA.<eos> Now I have the truth.<eos> My job was a front for a mercenary organization, and my boss is a criminal, and my coworkers are all dead. - Because I got them killed.<eos> - It wasn't your fault.<eos> They'd all be alive if I hadn't walked into that building.
- 5, 7, 3, 8, 4.<eos> - We know what this is about.<eos> We know who sent it.<eos> What we don't know is where's Lehman.<eos> Who?<eos> You must be in a lot of pain.<eos> Maybe that's why your memory's a bit fuzzy.<eos> Why don't we help Mr Michaux out?<eos> It flew somewhere.<eos> Those helicopters are stealth. They're not invisi...
It would be nice to have a normal conversation, if you don't mind a mess.<eos> - Sam.<eos> You can never go back to your place.<eos> - What?<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> Your bosses at the club are bad men.<eos> I was there tonight to stop them from doing a bad thing.<eos> Wait a minute. I'm --<eos> I needed your access card, and I took it.<eos> And now they think we work together.
Yeah.<eos> There's a 24-hour bowling alley.<eos> - That's not the point.<eos> - We have work tomorrow.<eos> Guys, you don't have to analyze everything you do.<eos> You can just decide to have fun.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We're fun.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You guys are about as spontaneous as my grandparents -- and they're dead.
- Thankyou, sir.<eos> Yeah, he's amazing.<eos> - No one told you to talk!<eos> - I'm sorry, Son.<eos> Hey, Stan.<eos> How come I've never seen this son ofyours before?<eos> Darnelle's been to the office a hundred times!<eos> Or are black people invisible toyou, you racist bastard?<eos> - [ Crowd Cheering] - Wow!<eos> They sure can run, can't they?
Uh, no.<eos> See, she had this play, and, uh-<eos> Stan, the rules are different here for more than just golf.<eos> Allow me to explain.<eos> # Here in Saudi Arabia #<eos> - No singing!<eos> Cheese and rice!<eos> Who are those guys?<eos> They are the police ofvice and virtue.<eos> They make sure everyone follows our country's strict moral code.
This was my fault.<eos> Hey, don't worry about me.<eos> I'm still your same old dad.<eos> What's that sound?<eos> Oh, I'm peeing.<eos> Fantastic!<eos> Hey, I found your real parents online.<eos> Stan and Francine didn't adoptyou.<eos> They kidnapped you.<eos> - What? - Yep, they nabbed you when you were three... - from a boat show.
It's been good.<eos> Solar flare activity continues to increase.<eos> Disrupting communications<eos> And planetary power grids<eos> Within one a.U. Of the binary system's major axis.<eos> On the positive side,<eos> Ormuz's defense grid<eos> Has been rendered inert by the e.M.P.<eos> The refugees have a fighting chance now.<eos> Yeah, well, they've got no chance
Where am I?<eos> Colombia, where do you think?<eos> And you just missed the last train that will come through the jungle for three days.<eos> He's good.<eos> He was a Groundling.<eos> You have betrayed us, we will make you pay.<eos> And then we will go back for your sons.<eos> Oh, my sons?<eos> No.<eos> They, too, will suffer for your terrible decisions.
I'm sorry.<eos> I think she might be... retar... retarded.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> Say hello to my tiny teddy.<eos> Oh!<eos> Tiny Teddy!<eos> And that's when it dawned on Michael.<eos> Oh, you teach kids, huh?<eos> Oh, I like to think they teach me.
Tarn, you forgot the med kit, so you've got to go back and get it. Take a rifle, two clips of ammo and a canteen.<eos> It's too late. He's not gonna make it.<eos> I'm sorry, Chief.<eos> Lords of Kobol... take these brave men into your arms. Take up... take... the spirits of our fallen friends... so that they may share in the everlasting life... that awaits us all beyond the vale of tears.<eos> So say we all.<eos> So say we all.<eos> Nothing awaits them. No eternal life.<eos> No damnation.<eos> Only oblivion.<eos> Because they haven't seen the face of God, I take it?
Get out of the way.<eos> No.<eos> Carl, do not think that I will not--<eos> I'm not gonna let you kill her! Okay ?<eos> She's carrying my child.<eos> My... Gods ! Men are so painfully stupid sometimes!<eos> how do you know that ?<eos> I know, all right ?<eos> She is not lying.<eos> They lie about everything, Helo. Their entire existence is a lie.
Cutie the bomb Met her at a beauty salon ? ? With a baby Louis Vuitton Under her underarm ?<eos> ? She said I can tell you rock ?<eos> ? I can tell by your charm Far as girls you got a flock ?<eos> ?

What am I gonna do, Chelina?<eos> It's just not as big a story as it used to be.<eos> We'd be better off with nobody than one.<eos> I'll call you after.<eos> I told you you are not wearing that hat.<eos> Take it off.<eos> Listen, last night... sometimes lawyers will bond over a cause, and, well, I...<eos> Chelina, let's go argue the cause.<eos> Remember, this motion is a nuisance to them.<eos> They will antagonize you.
Take it off.<eos> Listen, last night... sometimes lawyers will bond over a cause, and, well, I...<eos> Chelina, let's go argue the cause.<eos> Remember, this motion is a nuisance to them.<eos> They will antagonize you.<eos> If you even feel yourself wanting to retaliate, you say,<eos> "with all due respect, may it please the court."<eos> Anything else?<eos> Persevere.<eos> They will try to shut you down before you even begin.
- You did participate in the banter.<eos> - I participated.<eos> I, of course, wanted to be liked by my boss.<eos> But then... it started to go too far.<eos> And when it went too far, why not tell me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Because I'd let it go on.<eos> I felt maybe I'd gotten myself in...<eos> At the seminars, you get the impression that... the senior people here are good at dealing with these things.<eos> I wanted you to stop, but I still like you... and like working for you, and I was hoping... they maybe had a way to solve the problem without any hurt feelings.
The Red Sox won?<eos> What's this?<eos> The boys do it.<eos> Thought we'd give it a try.<eos> - You wanna smoke cigars? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Passing of the torch from the boys' club to us.<eos> Well, I'll smoke to that.<eos> Let me try.<eos> That's terrible.<eos> Well, this makes it official. We've evolved more than they have.
Are we ready?<eos> All set.<eos> You don't have to treat me like a leper, Shirley.<eos> I don't have a disease.<eos> Dwight, you're my friend, and I will try to stand by you through this but, let's not pretend you don't have a serious illness.<eos> There are worse things than loving an animal.<eos> Really?<eos> Name three.<eos> You know, I was never gonna tell you this.<eos> When you were 13, and your parents sent Bumpy away, it wasn't to some greener pasture where he'd be happier like they told you.
See, it was worth it.<eos> You better get ready for this because this is going to blow you away.<eos> The rust-colored material you found on the victim's head wound... was rust.<eos> Plain old ferric oxide, found on nearly every iron object on the planet Earth.<eos> Case breaker?<eos> No?<eos> As they say, "garbage in, garbage out. "<eos> Um... the Champagne Ride picks up strippers near the clubs, but not actually at the clubs.<eos> Right.<eos> The owners don't like that bus coming anywhere near the clubs because they don't make any money off them.
I'm going to start digging bullets out of people's houses.<eos> I was just reloading and continuing firing.<eos> I don't know what hit him.<eos> Bullets were flying.<eos> There were multiple rounds.<eos> It was chaos.<eos> At what point did Carolyn<eos> Davis go in foot pursuit after the two suspects ?<eos> After the driver went down, the other suspect, I guess he felt it was getting too hot back there.<eos> And they were shooting the entire time ?
No ?<eos> Nobody saw anything.<eos> I don't think this is police issue.<eos> Look, these folks were suspicious of the cops long before this happened.<eos> Now this is now your circle stories get started.<eos> The story keeps changing till you don't know what the truth is or whose story it was to begin with.<eos> So, uh, so the suspects saw that we were kind of distracted<eos> helping Bell, and they took the opportunity.<eos> I went on foot pursuit, you know.<eos> They, uh...
helping Bell, and they took the opportunity.<eos> I went on foot pursuit, you know.<eos> They, uh...<eos> I can't run as fast as I used to, I mean, so I lost them.<eos> But that's when I heard the two shots.<eos> No, I heard shots coming from... the east.<eos> How many ?<eos> Three.<eos> Four.<eos> And they sound a lot louder than a nine-millimeter.
Jose Fausto.<eos> Identified through prints in the car.<eos> He's got a long rap sheet.<eos> Dogs lost his scent.<eos> SWAT guys checked the building- nothing.<eos> Gang unit's beating the bushes.<eos> Word on the street is we shot two unarmed men and a high school kid.<eos> We got I.D.'s of all three dead suspects.<eos> Multiple felonies, drugs, immigration violations.<eos> They're all members of the 18th Street Chucos.
We've also connected you to a drug ring which was responsible for the death of a police officer.<eos> Miss Guerro?<eos> You're looking at prison time, so think about it.<eos> Whatever you could tell us about these guys will be in your best interest.<eos> Surveillance footage from Angie's Donut Shop shows you carrying drugs and getting into the delivery car.<eos> That alone gets you ten years.<eos> Okay, this is your last chance for your client to help herself out.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> We had no choice.<eos> They would have killed us.

- Right.<eos> That dude loved junk food.<eos> - He smoked a ton of weed.<eos> - Guy was a loser.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> His parents sent him loads of cash.<eos> He spent it all on dope, and then he stole stuff to get more dope.<eos> According to the registrar, he was taking classes till the end of term last fall.<eos> Why did he leave?<eos> He started hanging out with some other losers, and they convinced him to drop out.
Sure.<eos> Possible GSR.<eos> Which means the shot was fired from the wheelchair.<eos> How'd he shoot him in the face ?<eos> Hey, Vinnie.<eos> So we got a guy who fired a shot from a wheelchair and then escaped on foot.<eos> Social came back on the dental work of Veronica Juarez.<eos> No immediate family in the States.<eos> Apartment's leased in her name.<eos> Well, that's why bangers have girlfriends. Sign things they can't.
I haven't spent much time there, but I know someone who has.<eos> It's a "fugazi." It's fake.<eos> This ink might be real, but there's no way this is a tanglewood boy.<eos> There's no "in date."<eos> You see right here?<eos> The real tattoo, would have an in date, which is the day you join and have an out date, which is the day you leave legitimately. Which, by the way, rarely happens.<eos> This kid's definitely a wannabe.<eos> You seem pretty certain.<eos> I played baseball with these kids back at roosevelt. Hung out with them here and there.<eos> They wanted me to "come in" with them one time, but I didn't want to get mixed up. I knew what they were all about:
Who are you?<eos> What do you two make a year, huh?<eos> $95,746.32 and we earn every penny of it.<eos> I spend that a year on blow.<eos> Yeah, I can tell.<eos> Look at me.<eos> You see me wearing a silk suit and a fat tie with marinara sauce on my shirt?<eos> Forget about old timers.<eos> Those days are dead as dead.<eos> They were suckers.
Hey, guys, what's going on ?<eos> Wesley was in an accident.<eos> Did you know Wesley ?<eos> No, I mean... you know, he kind of hung around, but I didn't really know him.<eos> He was a bit of a mystery man.<eos> Always kept to himself.<eos> Where did he live ?<eos> His parents had a place in the Hamptons.<eos> He invited us up there a couple of times, but... we never went.<eos> His parents didn't really like people out there when they were home.
When Jesus had 12 at his side... I will have 12,000.<eos> Shit!<eos> And they will know that when they come.<eos> And they will come!<eos> They will come, brothers and sisters.<eos> They will come.<eos> In this garden... you will never hear... the words of other men.<eos> You will only hear the words of one man.<eos> One man inspiring you to live.<eos> And that... is the sound that they will fear.
Yes, but you're vulnerable to the belt's powers.<eos> Yeah, I - I know, but now that we know what to expect, we'll keep our distance, I promise.<eos> No, really, you should go, and, you know, if you find me a band in the process, that wouldn't be such a bad thing.<eos> Don't you see ?<eos> Women have evolved while men have grown more barbaric.<eos> Your destiny is to unite women, bring peace into the world,<eos> - and I can help.<eos> - But you're a demon.<eos> But I don't want to be. Nor with your powers will I have to be any longer.<eos> This whole good-versus-evil paradigm... it's all been fostered by men to divide us because they can't create life. So they try to destroy it.
Death's not so bad.<eos> I think you're gonna like it.<eos> I tried to save you.<eos> You should've tried harder!<eos> I couldn't.<eos> At the end, see, but you're forgetting about all the months before, all those times I asked you to come clean with me. If you told me the truth just once...<eos> I couldn't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did you come to my funeral? Did you see my wife, my kids?<eos> They're growing up without a father because of you.
If it helps, Paige, we never intended that you or your sisters would join the others<eos> - until much later.<eos> - Why?<eos> There'll still be straggler demons.<eos> - The ones that live and walk among us.<eos> - Ones you'll need to vanquish<eos> - so that conflict doesn't seep back in.<eos> - So we still have to fight demons?<eos> They'll be easy to spot while others are asleep,<eos> - because they won't be.
- You're not a reporter.<eos> Anyway, other...<eos> - But I'm a columnist.<eos> They're saying I could actually be sued if I gave bad advice.<eos> So they want every one of my columns to be reviewed by a professional shrink!<eos> Okay, well technically you're not a real shrink.<eos> So as I...<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Bachelor's degree, four years.<eos> My readers don't care about my credentials. - All they care about is my insight.
- Plan?<eos> What plan?<eos> - Our plan to die.<eos> It's the only way to get our lives back, our normal lives.<eos> And to stop everybody from coming after us, including them.<eos> - But...<eos> - No, no buts.<eos> We're free.<eos> Nobody knows we're alive, not even the demons.<eos> They think we died with Zankou.
The more magic we use, - the more likely the demons are to find us out.<eos> We didn't say we'll never use magic again.<eos> Besides, I think we really need this spell.<eos> What do you wanna do?<eos> End up confusion, hopefully.<eos> I've been thinking about it for the last couple of days, and all we need to do, is each of us to come up with one look, one disguise, that we wanna project to the rest of the world.<eos> You mean like a permanent, permanent one?<eos> That's the idea.<eos> How is it gonna end up confusion, especially for the boys?<eos> Oh because they won't see the disguises, neither would any of us.
I got to go talk to the kids.<eos> I'm not, uh, real comfortable with this.<eos> Mr. McNeil, I assure you it's standard procedure to interview witnesses alone.<eos> They're not witnesses.<eos> They're children.<eos> They're just... they're little kids.<eos> They're scared.<eos> That's why Mrs. Morgan is here.<eos> She's a child psychologist.<eos> They don't need therapy.
Speak now or forever hold your peace.<eos> Ok, i guess i'll go break the news to your mother.<eos> No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Oh, god.<eos> I told them this was gonna happen.<eos> Told who?<eos> Those fraternity boys?<eos> I know you don't want to tell on them, i do, but this is serious.<eos> Look where you are.<eos> They gave me the ad.
Such as?<eos> If a patient admits that they are planning to commit a serious felony like murder, privilege goes away.<eos> You call the police.<eos> So say one of the teenagers in the study opened up to your husband about a crime.<eos> How could i access that file?<eos> Privilege belongs to the patient or in this case, their legal guardians.<eos> Do you even know who these kids are?<eos> Only a few.<eos> And then there's Curson.<eos> They could help, but they won't.
I know, Dr. Graham.<eos> I was surprised, too. Because you two just met each other yesterday, and it's very rare to find 2 witnesses who don't know each other telling the exact same lie.<eos> So then i thought, "well, maybe they're just pretending to be strangers."<eos> You told me that your daughter Fatima has asthma, and Dr. Graham here is a pulmonary specialist.<eos> He treats lung disorders.<eos> So i went looking for the medication that the FBI took out of your house, and lo and behold, prescribing physician was none other than...<eos> Leila, it would be better to let me handle this.<eos> We want a lawyer.<eos> Listen to me, Leila, because i think you may have had enough of men making all the decisions for you, and if you bring a lawyer in here, i'm handing this whole mess... over to the men of the FBI.<eos> They already have Faraz.
You think so?<eos> Over my dead body.<eos> Let me tell you somethin'.<eos> I've been in this department too long to get mixed up in this political bullshit!<eos> - I'll tell you what, Taylor. - You'll tell me what?<eos> - Yeah, I'll tell you what!<eos> - I can't hear you.<eos> 'Cause you ain't sayin' nothin'!<eos> What the hell is goin' on here?<eos> My men have cases been waitin' 3, 4 weeks down here, and they're gonna push past 'em?
After you, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Tao's found something.<eos> With a little help from forensic accounting.<eos> The Duttons deal with banks throughout Europe.<eos> The kids keep themselves at a remove from the day-to-day finances by giving James Bloom their durable power of attorney to handle their business affairs. In effect, he runs the company.<eos> And they get the cash.<eos> Yeah, and they have plenty of it, too.
Yeah.<eos> Wish my parents never got us that mustang.<eos> He's been in the driveway every single day of this month.<eos> Doesn't have a word to say to me.<eos> Suz, I don't think it's like this with everyone.<eos> Well, his birthday got called, so he's a little upset.<eos> You wanna be like this ?<eos> Suz, there are men who are different.<eos> You could have a new life with.<eos> And they'd let you be who you are.

They would never hurt you.
When she talked about being online in 3 in the morning she was talking about herself.<eos> You saying Amy didn't have a heart attack?<eos> She did but someone might have helped her along.<eos> I guess anything's possible.<eos> - Those days were crazy.<eos> - How so?<eos> You're 24, too young to rent a car.<eos> You can't imagine being a multimillionare.<eos> Can't imagine your friends would die.<eos> Yeah but you are and they do.
My home for the next eight days- Or eight years, huh?<eos> Oh, this is wonderful.<eos> - Excuse me, Valerie?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Hi, i'm sorry to bother you-<eos> - No bother.<eos> I just wanted to say that we are so excited to be working with you.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> I used to beg my parents to let me stay up to watch "I'm it!"<eos> They were like, "go to bed, you're nine. "
Ma'am,I must repeat my concerns about this call<eos> You have.<eos> Thank you<eos> General Sanchez,this is the president of the United States<eos> My English is quite good,thank you General,I'm sure you're aware that nine American citizens were found assassinated on your country's border<eos> Yes,a tragedy<eos> And although we cannot confirm the murders took place in San Pasquale I assure you,we will investigate this crime<eos> Tell me,madam these Americans,they were tourists?<eos> General Sanchez,this is Jim Gardner chief of staff<eos> They were .. independent contractors working on the pipeline efforts there
How quickly can you get the money?<eos> Look, I know I shouldn't drink, but under the circumstances you'd think you could let this one slide.<eos> He's gonna call back.<eos> We need you at your best.<eos> Have you had many cases like this?<eos> I've seen my share of abductions.<eos> I don't know how you do it, this job.<eos> How do you stomach it?<eos> The men I hunt down are cowards.<eos> For the most part, they target the weakest members of society, women and children.
He's mobile, car in good condition.<eos> Our guess-<eos> - Jeep Cherokee, tinted windows.<eos> The murders have all involved rapes.<eos> But rape without penetration is a form of piquerism, and that tells us he's sexually inadequate.<eos> Psychiatric evaluations will show a history of paranoia stemming from a childhood trauma-- death of a parent or family member.<eos> And now he feels persecuted and watched.<eos> Murder gives him a sense of power.<eos> Organized killers have a fascination with law enforcement.<eos> They will inject themselves into the investigation.
My babies.<eos> My sweet, little babies.<eos> I was crazy out of my mind.<eos> I didn't know what to do.<eos> And I knew the cops were gonna blame me, and they have.<eos> So you ran?<eos> So what've I got now?<eos> You have your innocence.<eos> For the sake of your children<eos> I believe that they, at the very least, deserve the truth.
The alarm would've been activated.<eos> When the cops got here, the house was locked tight and the alarm was hot.<eos> So the night the Crawfords were murdered the only way in or out was with the dog collar.<eos> Gideon, whoever killed this family had to be a big guy.<eos> Chris Crawford was a black belt in judo.<eos> So are you.<eos> I've got a gun to your back.<eos> Maybe you could take it from me.<eos> But your children are in the same room.<eos> And if you fail, they die.
Something that'll make him open it. Yeah.<eos> He's impotent.<eos> Something that'll make him feel in control.<eos> I got something.<eos> You got this guy's number. He's visited 6 porn sites in the past half hour.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Hold on.<eos> He's posting to a message board. "naughtyhobbies.net." Looks like some sort of site for bomb enthusiasts.<eos> "To all my friends out there, Beware.<eos> They are onto you."
-Going where?<eos> A letter come to hand I need to take to Bill's missus.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Camp business.<eos> -He wrote just before he got killed.<eos> -l see.<eos> And you know who fucking give it to me?<eos> How crazy life got?<eos> And money must buy these bastards any fucking thing they want!
Mr Lee, the man he tried to kill, has worked well for me in several camps.<eos> Then God bless Lee, and off with fucking Wu's head.<eos> You've got your finger on the cause of it, too, your Chink being forward-looking.<eos> "Set the bodies ablaze, on with the day's trade."<eos> - This one, being longer in the tooth...<eos> - Set what bodies ablaze?<eos> Custom holds stronger than what passes for his mind.<eos> - What bodies, Mr Swearengen?<eos> - The whores for your workers.<eos> Not only does burning the corpses save cargo space... far as the transporting of their bones back to the homeland... which, as I gather, they hold as their big fucking chance at the afterlife.
I wouldn't want the cocksucker harmed.<eos> I don't intend him any.<eos> Don't be fucking clever with me.<eos> He's allied with Tolliver.<eos> Are you aware of that?<eos> Bedridden, I know more than you.<eos> The point is, if their man's allied with Tolliver and fucking harm comes to him, between the hoopleheads and me, who will Yankton put it on?<eos> - You.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Do they understand how most of what happens is people being drunk and stupid and trying to find something else to blame besides that that makes their lives totally fucked?
I swear before Almighty God I won't reveal a word that's said here today.<eos> Now, what's on your mind?<eos> Well, here's the thing.<eos> I lied to my parents.<eos> - I'm not gay.<eos> - You're not.<eos> Not really.<eos> All I know is, I wanted to get the hell out of that camp.<eos> So, I lied to my parents.<eos> I told them I was really worried that I was having feelings for other guys. They did exactly what I wanted them to.
Stop it!<eos> Knock it off!<eos> Did you see him?<eos> ! He was kissing her!<eos> Oh,my god,you're bleeding.<eos> That freak was kissing her!<eos> I don't care.You gotta calm down now.<eos> The world is filled with good fathers.<eos> How do we recognize them?<eos> They're the ones who are missed so terribly that everything falls apart in their absence.

- Looking good there, Al.<eos> Call me when you dump her.<eos> All right?<eos> Hey.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - God, what a hideous kid.<eos> - They all look the same to me.<eos> Looks nothing like him.<eos> Bet it's not even his.<eos> That kid has blue eyes, they've got brown.
But they must have some serious technology behind this.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Is that... ?<eos> .Harriet, for God's sake!<eos> This is beyond a joke, you cannot wander...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> That's the Prime Minister.<eos> If aliens fake an alien crash and an alien pilot, what do they get?<eos> Us.<eos> They get us.
I hope... Oh, Lord!<eos> I hope that this theory will be validated soon. If not immediately.<eos> Plenty more.<eos> It's working!<eos> Gwyneth, send them back.<eos> They lied, they're not angels!<eos> - Liars?<eos> - Look at me.<eos> If your mother and father could look down and see this, they'd tell you the same.<eos> They'd give you the strength.
- ...rehab houses for poor people.<eos> - Yeah, see, that's the problem.<eos> I've waited my whole life to spit in my old man's face.<eos> He's not lying in the gutter- - People change, Greg-<eos> - He's building houses for people for free.<eos> Blaire, I hope you can hear me.<eos> On that night, you and your mom were driving. You stopped at a red light.<eos> Another car pulled up next to you.<eos> There were three men inside.<eos> They pulled a gun and dragged your mom...
I'm telling you, I didn't hit him!<eos> I loved him.<eos> So much so that I wish I had died instead of him.<eos> All the witnesses agree.<eos> They describe the nanny as dangerous.<eos> Not just mad, dangerous.<eos> And all the witnesses say the mother knew that it was impossible not to.<eos> Yet she entrusts her baby to her and then tries to get her convicted.<eos> The grandparents want her convicted, too.<eos> But they didn't choose the nanny
Social injustice, the dynastic madness of the in-laws...<eos> It's all there!<eos> I tell you what - let's start by phoning a couple of journalists.<eos> - Do you have any Mustafa Sandal?<eos> - No.<eos> Am I supposed to get the journalists to testify?<eos> You do what you always do.<eos> You lay into the grandparents.<eos> You expose their selfishness and their meanness.<eos> They are accusing her, so confront them.
What check?<eos> What was she thinking?<eos> Get out of the street, fool!<eos> Get out of the street, fool!<eos> Get off of my car, fool!<eos> I got to get this girl off my mind.<eos> Rochelle, I love your place.<eos> How you keep it so clean with three kids?<eos> Oh, no, my children know how to act.<eos> They know, once they walk through that front door,
Since I was the oldest, I had to be the emergency adult.<eos> If you smell smoke, and you think the house is gonna catch fire, get your brother and your sister and get out of here.<eos> If you smell gaz and you think the house is gonna blow up, get your brother and your sister and get out of here.<eos> If you smell smoke, and your brother catches on fire, get your sister and get out of here.<eos> Fortunately, the house never caught fire... and neither did my brother.<eos> Mom, why is it that Drew and Tonya get to go to school in our own neighborhood but I have to go all way out to Brooklyn Beach?<eos> Brooklyn Beach was a poor italian neighborhood on the other side of town.<eos> It was just like Bedstyle, take away the gangs, add the mob.<eos> Because the junior high school around here is like a hoodlum factory.<eos> And those white kids, they get an education.
- How are you, son? You don't have to do that.<eos> I'm not the Pope.<eos> No, old habits die hard.<eos> My old priest used to make me kiss him on the ring.<eos> On his finger.<eos> There was none of that going on.<eos> That makes me sick as well, people saying priests are paedophiles and kiddie fiddlers.<eos> There's probably, I mean, there probably are.<eos> I mean, you probably know some, but it's no higher percentage of perverts in...<eos> But they, you know... They're in all walks of life, aren't they?
- First, that one.<eos> Lots of photographs of your dad there, doing his...<eos> Whatever he's doing.<eos> I don't see any photographs of you with your friends.<eos> - Have you got any friends your own age?<eos> - Yeah, you.<eos> You're my best friend.<eos> - Apart from me?<eos> - Well, all the friends downstairs.<eos> They're all friends, they're all old friends.
Make believe she's not here?<eos> Lie about what I feel?<eos> No.<eos> You shouldn't have to do that.<eos> Even my boyfriend hasn't been around in a while.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> My parents think the sun rises and sets on that moron.<eos> I need him to tell my parents that I'm doing better.<eos> They'll listen to him.<eos> They think the sun rises and sets on him.
There were weird voices again on the answering machine.<eos> I listened to them twice and I've been sick all night.<eos> Don't listen to them.<eos> That is so male.<eos> I love that.<eos> It seems simple to me.<eos> Look, are you sure these things aren't explainable,<eos> - I mean, like cell phone transmissions?<eos> - No, they're not.<eos> You know how I can sense spirits, like I can feel what they're feeling?
Or maybe a yellow.<eos> Oh, come on now.<eos> Yellow really doesn't go with Paul Anka.<eos> If nothing goes with him, we may have to move.<eos> Do you want to know the problem here?<eos> Actually, no.<eos> I don't like problems.<eos> I avoid them when I can, and I don't like people pointing them out to me.<eos> The guys are almost done prepping the walls, and then they're gonna want to paint.<eos> If we don't have a color for them, they're gonna have nothing to do, and then they're gonna bolt, and we won't see them again for weeks.

Wow, Oliver Twist just kindly asked for a little more gruel, and you kicked him right in the junk.<eos> Who? You broke those darling little girls' hearts.<eos> They'll find someone else.<eos> How is this not your thing?<eos> I don't want to coach a soccer team.<eos> They don't need a coach.<eos> How closely were you listening?<eos> Well, not that closely.<eos> Kids usually talk, but they don't say anything.<eos> They just kind of yammer, so if you don't find them cute, they're just boring.
Grandpa, thank you so much.<eos> You can thank your grandmother.<eos> She helped pick it out.<eos> Thank you, Grandma.<eos> Dinner is served, Mrs. Gilmore.<eos> Thank you, Eliza.<eos> You can flip through that a little later.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, Grandpa, is it true that every restaurant in the Plaka... has a view of the Acropolis?<eos> They like to think so... but we found this charming little taverna, Dionysus.
The good news is Dr. Bailey stopped the bleeding.<eos> The bad news is we've given your penis to the cops.<eos> Have a nice life.<eos> The results of your labs are clean.<eos> The tumor is benign.<eos> You can go home today.<eos> Oh, you...<eos> At some point, you have to make a decision.<eos> Boundaries don't keep other people out.<eos> They fence you in.
I understand.<eos> I knew you would.<eos> That's why is so important for me to see you.<eos> Do you talk to your friends?<eos> Yes, of course but it's not really the same.<eos> I mean... and I don't mean this in an arrogant way but I just...<eos> - That I see the world differently.<eos> - How's that?<eos> Well... for example, I think that sex and death are very connected.<eos> And I don't think that they'd understand that.
Then stay away.<eos> There's nothing there.<eos> No masses, no fibrous tangles, nothing.<eos> It's not neurofibromatosis.<eos> Drs. Chase are 0 for 3.<eos> Even when they agree, they're wrong.<eos> So, next, what else could cause neural damage as well as all the nodules?<eos> Berger's disease. - He's never been out of the country.<eos> - Have his parents?<eos> They could have brought it back.
There's no virus that causes that, no DNA mutation.<eos> You're gonna have one dinner with two people.<eos> Sixty minutes, most of it spent chewing or talking about the weather.<eos> Unless they say something like, "Do you prefer the chardonnay or the merlot?"<eos> and, "Oh, we kept Greg locked in a closet for 17 years".<eos> You're not gonna learn anything.<eos> Okay.<eos> We'd like to talk to some of your friends, see if they have any similar symptoms.<eos> The doctors in the ER already asked me that.<eos> We understand, but they didn't have all the information that we have now.
Or because you're a coward?<eos> Tough choice.<eos> You'd be wasting two hours of the kid's time.<eos> Is that deeply and unforgivably morally wrong? No.<eos> Because it's not a waste of his time.<eos> Unless we're wrong.<eos> Unless his condition's got nothing to do with his friend's.<eos> You're just afraid of being wrong.<eos> Your parents called.<eos> - They had to catch an earlier...
"I, Margo Davis, have been informed of the risks... which may arise from my refusal of advised medical care.<eos> - I hereby release"--<eos> - Who are you?<eos> I work for the hospital.<eos> "...the Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital and its employees, agents and otherwise, for any adverse medical conditions resulting from my refusal.<eos> It is not the hospital's fault if my son kicks off".<eos> - Kicks off?<eos> - I punched up the language. Mostly for clarification.<eos> "I understand my doctors consider my decision to be completely idiotic"-- Why are you doing this?<eos> - "But I am convinced I know more than they do.
Dr. House, I would appreciate it if you left us...<eos> Get that out of my face. CUDDY:<eos> What are you tryjng to prove, House?<eos> sebastian: Dr. House, I would apprecjate jt jf you left the room whjle...<eos> He's sweating like a pig.<eos> It's 1 00 degrees in here, House, because you turned up the thermostat.<eos> Did they hear me?<eos> The media, did they listen?<eos> He's disoriented.<eos> They have to hear me.
It may become necessary in order to save your life.<eos> I like my leg.<eos> I've had it for as long as I can remember.<eos> Greg, I love your leg as much as you do.<eos> They're not cutting it off.<eos> The patient made the right choice.<eos> Tell a surgeon that it's okay to cut a leg off, and he's gonna spend the night polishing his good hacksaw. Right.<eos> Surgeons could care less about saving limbs.<eos> Ofcourse they care about their patients.<eos> They just care about themselves more, which is not an unreasonable position.
He showed you off for me.<eos> He's very proud of you.<eos> You were there.<eos> At the Havens crime scene.<eos> "Crime scene."<eos> You still using the word "victims," then?<eos> No.<eos> Victims suffer injustice.<eos> These men suffered the opposite you.<eos> You stop them before they cause pain...
And apparently the Air Force just swooped in and took his body away.<eos> Well, then how do you know he's dead?<eos> I mean, did anybody actually see him dead, Russ?<eos> Call me crazy...<eos> I don't care if you're crazy, Dave.<eos> I care about how all this affects my family.<eos> If there's something going on here, something bigger than the hurricane... how can I protect my kids when they're not with me?<eos> They're with you, Russ.<eos> They're in the town.<eos> But right now the town may need your protection just as much as they do.
Whoop-- there they are.<eos> Ooh, who's your friend?<eos> Thanks, I guess.<eos> You look really nice too, except your bow tie is a little bit crooked, and if you don't fix it, I may have to leave this conversation.<eos> Okay, okay, okay, how's that?<eos> Good.<eos> I'm sorry I was so tough on the tickets.<eos> I hope your friends weren't too disappointed.<eos> Hey, the rules are the rules, right?<eos> As much as they wanted to come, they'll just have to sit at home like the other 20,000 people and watch.
Uh, we did it on a boat.<eos> One!<eos> Well, let's go check these guys out.<eos> I'm a little nervous about this.<eos> Oh, no, you're going to do great.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, my God, there's so many of 'em!<eos> How do I know who to pick?<eos> I... I don't know anything about them.<eos> I mean, they, they could be married or gay or...
I've looked up to the league.<eos> You were my heroes, every one of you.<eos> And you...<eos> You were more than a hero.<eos> I idolized you. I wanted to be you.<eos> Whenever I was out there facing down the bad guys, I'd think:<eos> "What would Superman do?"<eos> Now I know.<eos> I believe in fair play. I believe in taking people at their word and giving them the benefit of the doubt.<eos> Back home, I've come up against my share of pretty nasty bad guys, but I never had to act the way they did to win a fight.
So I can tell them to be tested.<eos> Was Robin Weller, one of men you talked to? Yes.<eos> He told me that he had killer strain, too.<eos> That it was positive before he had sex with my brother, that he knew, he didn't tell Alex, and he infected him. And that made you angry?<eos> Yes, and I saw Robin at the clubs picking up young guys.<eos> I tried to warn them, but they were high on meth, they wouldn't listen.<eos> I couldn't save them.<eos> Robin was gonna murder them, just like he murdered my brother.<eos> That's why you killed the two men responsible for Alex's death?<eos> Oh, I had to protect the other men they would have infected, and all the men they would have infected.
We was all at this club, Chinese Whites<eos> There were famous people like Dean Gaffney and Jodie Marsh and thingy, that professor Stephen Hawkins and it was amazing, I was well the fittest girl there.<eos> And the people came in from Coronation Street and they tried to do me.<eos> Even that Chesney tried to stick his tongue down me.<eos> I'm not a slag, or nuffin. I wanna find a life partner, cos l've already had six kids by seven different blokes.<eos> - Where did you meet the footballers?<eos> - l'm getting there!<eos> I was just about to say it, if you had just waited.<eos> Then the footballers came in or somethin' or nuffin from the clubs Like Tottenham and Chelsea Park Rangers,<eos> They like really wanted to do me, but I was wearing this short skirt so they could all see my strawberry Mivvi.

I'm so degraded. I'm used. I'm dirty.<eos> It was rubbish, anyway, cos they all had well tiny knobs.
- Isn't she beautiful?<eos> - Yes, she's really quite something.<eos> Hark at us.<eos> Two young mothers.<eos> Let's talk about being pregnant and babies and... Shit.<eos> - l just need to feed mine.<eos> - Ooh!<eos> And me!<eos> Men.<eos> They don't know what we go through, do they?
Haven't you ever seen a man sweep his lawn with a broom before?<eos> Okay, that's enough. I've had it.<eos> Go on, get out of here, you punks.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you people?<eos> !<eos> Doesn't anybody have respect for personal property anymore?<eos> You can think about that for a few days until I give this back to you.<eos> I bet orphanages don't take family trips.<eos> Or kids raised by animals.<eos> How come they get all the breaks?
"Failure to smile 'Hello,' $50 fine?<eos> Not knowing your neighbor's name: $25?<eos> Failure to remove your fence: $100?"<eos> People can be resistant to change.<eos> - What's the "Hug your child" initiative?<eos> - Everyone has to publicly hug their child at least once a day.<eos> A hotline will be set up so that children can inform on non-hugging parents.<eos> You're going to make kids inform on their parents?<eos> Parents, neighbors, teachers, everybody!<eos> If they've got nothing to hide, they've got nothing to worry about.
What?<eos> !<eos> The real snitch just confessed to me.<eos> -Who is it?<eos> -I'm not going to tell you.<eos> I don't want you hurting him.<eos> -He's a misguided, weak, pathetic individual who... -It's Craig!<eos> Wait!<eos> Dad, why are you doing this?<eos> We're gonna call child welfare, and this time they'll come.
The whole damn National Guard is overseas!<eos> Meanwhile... 5 days to election and our numbers are off the cliff, like wildly damn coyote.<eos> And you know why? Because we got these undead creeps at every damn mall and bus-stop looking all shot up and pitiful.<eos> They do make quite an impression.<eos> Why don't we just ignore them?<eos> Say what?<eos> Just treat them like regular vets.<eos> Welcome home.<eos> Our heroic sons.<eos> Let them do what they want to.
Do you think Phillip might come back?<eos> Paddy Runihan's boy came back!<eos> I would like to see him one more time.<eos> Before...<eos> I don't know, mum.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I had forgotten, alright.<eos> Mainly I forgot that you don't treat other people's lives as a game.<eos> Now I had over a thousand Phillips on my conscience.<eos> But they voted.
Maybe she said something to him.<eos> Maybe she told him she was going to run away.<eos> She hated school, she hated trying to please her father.<eos> Come on, if she ran away, he would tell her dad.<eos> He'd let somebody know.<eos> He'd have to talk to the police.<eos> - He'd have to.<eos> - I don't know, Al.<eos> People tell priests lots of things.<eos> They got to keep a lot of secrets.
I don't want to go on a plane that's going to crash.<eos> Trust me, Bridge, planes don't crash... really.<eos> Almost never.<eos> They're amazingly safe.<eos> Only people who are ignorant or superstitious stay off planes 'cause they think they're going to crash.<eos> So...<eos> Don't worry.<eos> No dreams.<eos> Not a single ignorant, superstitious one.<eos> Hey, make sure you guys give these notes to your teachers so they know why you're not in school tomorrow.
Come here!<eos> Any one of you!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> Quite a performance, huh?<eos> I don't know... he seemed pretty convincing to me.<eos> You're saying that because you sense something, because you saw something?<eos> No, not really. It's just... he genuinely scared me.<eos> I did get some numbers, though.<eos> Couldn't tell you if they make him a liar or not.
Constable Jones.<eos> Oh, they were house hunting.<eos> Whoever did this must have been waiting for them in the back.<eos> What do you think, Constable Jones?<eos> Well, he could only kill them one at a time, couldn't he, sir?<eos> So why didn't the other one put up a fight?<eos> If the other was killed before the other one got in, why didn't he notice?<eos> Unless there were two murderers.<eos> What? Both hiding in the back?<eos> If the killer did get in here, they must both have been out of the vehicle at the time, leaving it unlocked.
- Oh yeah, more than you'd think.<eos> Really?<eos> No, okay?<eos> Okay, no.<eos> It's... It's unprecedented.<eos> All right, so... so, what... what happens now?<eos> Mrs. Carlyle gave me permission to call the Captain in.<eos> He recovered the ransom money.<eos> The kidnappers called back two hours later, thank God,<eos> And they're gonna set up another drop.
- Catalina.<eos> Mm. Potato, tomato.<eos> So where does Earl keep his money?<eos> Earl's my friend. I'm not gonna help you steal his money.<eos> Oh, well, that's unfortunate for you, because, you are not the one standing with a freshly-broken bottle now, are you?<eos> Well, this will still hurt if I hit you with it.<eos> Joy, I've told you a million times, the money isn't in the room.<eos> Stop breaking in here and messing the place up.<eos> Fine, but if you get to eat fancy cereal, your kids should, too.<eos> They're not my kids, Joy.
You know the kind of guy who does nothing but bad things And then wonders why his life sucks?<eos> Well, that was me.<eos> Every time somethin' good happened to me, somethin' bad was always waitin' around the corner.<eos> karma.<eos> That when I realized I had to change.<eos> So, I made a list of everything bad I've ever done and, one by one, I'm gonna make up for all my mistakes.<eos> I'm just tryin' to be a better person.<eos> What's with all the balloons?<eos> Well, I was hoping they might help me get out of trouble.
I´m good for the money, I just don´t have it right now, and I wondered if we could work out some sort of payment plan.<eos> So, what, you see betting as some sort of hire purchase agreement?<eos> I´ll tell you what.<eos> How about I just tear up this IOU right now? Debt cleared.<eos> Debt cleared?<eos> When I was 14, my father Joe was robbed after a night working Walthamstow dogs.<eos> Two guys jumped him.<eos> They were never caught.<eos> My dad took one punch to the head, fell to the ground dead.<eos> And they got away with the princely sum of 200 quid.
I just missed it as a ravings of a mad man.<eos> Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.<eos> How long you've been working here Carl?<eos> Um,..about two months, I guess.<eos> And in that time.. I have witnessed more freaky things than I've seen in my entire life.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You know why you keep finding these things Carl?<eos> Because I ... look for them?<eos> Because you want to find them.<eos> Keep chasing monsters and one day they'll be chasing you.
So then you got your sister to pull the robbery for you?<eos> No,it was supposed to be no big deal You just take the diamonds and you show the picture and you come out and I go to the parking lot<eos> She did what she did to help me to save my life<eos> So martin rausch is a gambler<eos> Right?<eos> He's a bad one He gets himself in debt to remy<eos> Which puts remy in trouble with his backers<eos> That kind of cash.<eos> I'm surprised that they didn't just kill rausch<eos> But dead guys don't pay Ultimately,they just want their money
Forced to pull over.<eos> No, no.<eos> Carjacking victim number one locked her keys in her car.<eos> She called AAA on her cell phone and ten minutes later, these guys showed up.<eos> Victim number two got lost entered the destination into her navigation system.<eos> And victim number three ran out of gas.<eos> He called his onboard assistance service and spoke to a real operator, but the robbers got there first with a can of gas.<eos> It's like they're eavesdropping on their cell phones or something.<eos> Maybe, but that doesn't explain their knowledge of their personal possessions.<eos> And they all have different cell phone carriers.
Well, in your case, a lot of unanswered voice mails.<eos> I can tell you that.<eos> After 9/11, the FCC mandated that all cell phones be able to locate people in the event of an emergency.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> That a GPS locator chip has to be put in every new phone by 2005.<eos> And newer phones can be used to track people within a range of 30 feet.<eos> But you're still going to need access to classified data.<eos> Are you saying that these robbers have figured out how to intercept encrypted material from a military satellite?<eos> No, that's impossible.<eos> Listen, somehow they've gotten that GPS information.

Raymond Sites was murdered, right?<eos> These guys killed to get their hands on what was in that truck.<eos> Yeah. I mean, everything they have done has been planned.<eos> They only thing they haven't kept to is a time frame.<eos> First they say 12 hours, then they say an hour, then they blow the bomb 11 minutes early.<eos> And why didn't they call back, give us a chance to pay?<eos> What if they didn't use the cesium because they didn't have to?<eos> Like, I hold a gun to your back, you're going to do what I say.<eos> Doesn't matter if I have the gun, as long as you think I do.<eos> They wanted us to think they were blowing a dirty bomb.
English subtitles 16 Banks Robbed<eos> 2 Suspects<eos> $2,700 Average Take<eos> Bank robbers are creatures of habit.<eos> Once they develop a successful routine, they stick to it.<eos> Time of day, day of the week, choice of weapon, disguise, region... these will be the same again and again.<eos> It's actually a lot like these fish.<eos> Given enough time, it's possible to discern a distinct pattern that each one will follow.<eos> Well, mathematicians, they do so love finding these patterns, don't they?
Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.<eos> Heisenberg noted that the, uh, the act of observation will affect the observed.<eos> In other words, when you watch something, you change it.<eos> And, uh... for example, like, an electron.<eos> You know, you can't really measure it without bumping into it in some small way.<eos> Any physical act of observation requires interaction with a form of energy, like light, and that will change the nature of the electron, its path of travel.<eos> All right, all right, hold on, hold on.<eos> You know I got, like, a C in physics, so just take me through how this relates to the case. Don...<eos> you've observed the robbers.<eos> They know it; that will change their actions.
Father, mothers, their children...<eos> How do you forgive yourself if you're wrong?<eos> You don't.<eos> We can't be wrong.<eos> Larry... you have a minute?<eos> Yes, because we all have exactly the same number of minutes, at all times.<eos> - Do we not?<eos> - Oh, my.<eos> Listen, I am working on a statistical analysis that involves complex variables and multiple vectors.<eos> I've come up with a solution as to the zero point, but, um... the experts in the field think it's right, and I... in fact, they're quite sure of it, but, um...
Just broken glass.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Sleeping it off.<eos> - How long has this been going on?<eos> - Too long.<eos> You know, last night sealed the deal.<eos> She's getting help whether she wants it or not.<eos> Speaking of help... how can I?<eos> Well, I'm gonna need to talk to the boys privately.<eos> I, I don't know what they know.
Trying to keep the Newport Group afloat while Kirsten's gone?<eos> That and everything else.<eos> And I haven't exactly been making life easier for you, I know.<eos> It's not me I'm worried about, kid.<eos> Why don't you sit down.<eos> I understand everything you've been through what with your brother, and Marissa and now school.<eos> You have to move past all that.<eos> - I am. I want to.<eos> - I don't think you do.<eos> Those kids at Harbor, Ryan, are no better than you. But they're working towards their future.
You know what Dwight, he's your work boss, ok ?<eos> - He's not your relationship boss.<eos> - That's true.<eos> Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about.<eos> You're both salesmen, I mean that's something right there.<eos> True.<eos> Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name.<eos> It's all gold.<eos> Guys are usually my best customers, they buy the high-end stuff, like the beads and the sequins and stuff, for gifts, you know.<eos> They don't know what they're looking at so... I make suggestions.
Yes there is.<eos> - Behind the shells.<eos> Oh my god.<eos> - What ? What ?<eos> What ?<eos> - I know. I know exactly what to do. - Great.<eos> I'm a deer hunter.<eos> I go all the time with my dad.<eos> One thing about deer. They have very good vision. One thing about me...<eos> I'm better at hiding than they are at vision.
Good to see you, too, Coach.<eos> Jaglieski.<eos> For someone who's eager to get back in school...<eos> -you've got a funny way of showing it.<eos> -Sorry. Jenny's been sick.<eos> I had to stay home with her.<eos> Sick?<eos> Here, do you mind?<eos> -You know anything about babies, Coach?<eos> -I know more than they know about me.
A cab.<eos> He's in the hospital in a coma.<eos> What?<eos> In intensive care.<eos> I want to keep working on things.<eos> I'm not good at things like this.<eos> I'm better when I'm working, trying to fix things.<eos> Yeah, sure. I understand that.<eos> I like dogs better than people.<eos> They don't judge, they're not duplicitous.
- Yeah?<eos> - You were right.<eos> Hemorrhagics.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Sometimes I amaze even myself.<eos> Report out of Flint. Fifty marines are seriously ill.<eos> Pox?<eos> - No, they're bleeding.
I need you to come home.<eos> I need your help, kid.<eos> I can't do this anymore.<eos> Please.<eos> Just call me, huh? Please?<eos> That's it. That's definitely the way to go.<eos> - I'm gonna kidnap my own kids back.<eos> - I'm not hearing this, Tommy.<eos> Especially after what we just went through.<eos> You know, your lips- - They're moving, but there's no sound coming out.
A magnifying glass ?<eos> Yes.... For these.<eos> You got the tiny post-its !<eos> Awesome !<eos> For our tiny bulletin board!<eos> I have a dentist appointment that got moved to Tuesday at 4 PM.<eos> Don't floss before you come in, it makes your gums bloody.<eos> Bottom line -- together, Elliot and I are the greatest co-chief residents of all time.<eos> You two are, without a doubt, the worst co-chief residents of all time.<eos> And in case you haven't noticed, we've got ourselves one hospital chock-full of monkey interns, and, news-flash, your job is to catch whatever they're flinging.
Now you and I, we both know that your super-secret, go-to toy are your building blocks.<eos> Well, it's time to shine, Jackie Cox.<eos> It is time to shine.<eos> Earn Daddy's love on three.<eos> 1, 2, 3, earn Daddy's love.<eos> - 27-second diaper change.<eos> - I can change a diaper in 20 seconds.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Say, Ronnie, what say we let the kids play for a while?<eos> They could play with, oh, I don't know, how about the building blocks that Jack very rarely ever even touches?
Release Me by Tom Jones I know. Tom Jones was too much of a show-off to be a soul searcher.<eos> (Singing to jukebox) For I don't love you any more...<eos> Aye, get down, Shep!<eos> One of the finest songs ever written in the English language, apart from Sultans Of Swing and Chirpy Chirpy Cheep Cheep.<eos> Pint of bitter and a couple of Es for the dog, Kev.<eos> Where's your momma gone?<eos> Where's your momma gone?<eos> Used to sing that to the kids when Monica fucked off.<eos> Never a dry eye in the 'ouse.<eos> Shot upstairs howling, they all did.
Hey, we've gotta go.<eos> The Realtor's inside. - She's taking her sweet time.<eos> - They're interested.<eos> Gretchen thinks they're gonna make us an offer.<eos> Why does Mom have to move?<eos> We talked about that, Cassidy.<eos> I want to.<eos> What about my friends...<eos> Can I go to my room?<eos> We have to go while they're here.
It got your hopes up, didn't it?<eos> Homer, before I take the kids,<eos> I want you to swear you're not up to something.<eos> I swear.<eos> And I'd also like to know why your hand is in that cast.<eos> Because you look even more beautiful now than the day I married you.<eos> Welcome to santa's village, where it's christmas every day.<eos> Closed on christmas.<eos> Those reindeer look really uncomfortable.<eos> That's because they don't thrive in this environment!
Yet.<eos> You've wrecked my life!<eos> You're gonna wreck my life!<eos> Hey, Marge, why are you with Krusty?<eos> These kids are too old for clowns.<eos> Actually, Homer, I'm... into your lady.<eos> Hey, man, she's not my lady anymore.<eos> We split up, it's all cool...<eos> I... I'll kill you!<eos> Once they destroy each other... Then we make our move.
And this is Marge, our surprisingly hot nanny.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Simpson.<eos> Don't mention it, Miss...<eos> October.<eos> But don't look at her passport-- it's different.<eos> These are the famous Shaolin Temple monks.<eos> They pursue spiritual peace through mastery of bare-fisted murder.<eos> I've heard of these guys.<eos> You can wave your arms at them and make funny faces, and they just have to stand there and take it.
Homer, are you sure we aren't crossing a line here?<eos> I happen to know that the person inside that leprechaun suit is a single mother.<eos> Deion, this is Timmy Thomas.<eos> He has Timmy Thomas disease.<eos> Mr. Overstweet, could you do an obnoxious end zone dance for me today?<eos> Pweeease?<eos> How you like me now?<eos> Yello.<eos> Homer, this is LeBron James.<eos> The fans love my dunks, but they hate my dancing.
Alcatraaaz is wide spread.<eos> I'm talkin' da junk.<eos> Just what we need-- another lame suburban kid who loves rap.<eos> So?<eos> You like the blues.<eos> Yes, but the blues are unpopular.<eos> Man, are you illin'.<eos> Rappers stopped saying "illin'" 12 years ago.<eos> I'm keepin' it real.<eos> They stopped saying "keepin' it real" three years ago.
Homer!<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> You can use any section of the paper.<eos> Except Metro.<eos> It's a big snooze.<eos> Please give me back my boy.<eos> I just want to tell him I love him one more time.<eos> Mom, it's me.<eos> Don't cry, I'm okay.<eos> The kidnappers say if you worry too much... they'll kill me.
How do you like those croutons!<eos> Why does that woman thwart my sporadic interest in my children?<eos> Shouldn't Bart and I be able to choose our own religion if we want to?<eos> Strange as it sounds, Dad, I agree with you.<eos> Everyone should be able to choose their faith, just like I chose Buddhism.<eos> Buddhism?<eos> Well, I guess lots of kids have imaginary friends.<eos> I'll ignore that.<eos> In fact, I'm gonna help you.<eos> I have a pretty good idea where they are.
I'm all-you-can-eat salad bar!<eos> Yo, and I'm sneeze guard.<eos> Put it on the glass, dawgs.<eos> And I'm jumbo shrimp!<eos> Maximum two servings!<eos> That's bull...<eos> Man!<eos> I love you, Hillside Wrangler!<eos> Tell us, Mr. Burkhart, what led you to the magical world of children's books?<eos> I wanted to be a children's book illustrator ever since Playboy wouldn't publish my cartoons because they were too filthy.
Okeydokey.<eos> Let's see here.<eos> Uh, here's one from 1834.<eos> "It's unlawful for a man to be hatless during daylight hours."<eos> If I didn't arrest you that night in the park,<eos> I'm not going to arrest you now.<eos> Stupid prison guard jobs thinks it's so big.<eos> Everyone gets a prison job but me.<eos> All my best friends are guards.<eos> They think they're so cruel and corrupt, but they're not.
- Thank you.<eos> - It's a beautiful bird.<eos> God, it's fucking cerulean.<eos> So let's just close this door And see what happens.<eos> Jesus.<eos> - Thanks for letting me stay.<eos> - Sure.<eos> I haven't put the boys to bed for awhile.<eos> - I miss that.<eos> - Yeah, they miss it too.
You know, the first time I saw a man die -- a bunch of men, really -- all their cocks were hanging out.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Sounds kind of freaky, man.<eos> What was that about?<eos> It was about who you are, what you are, or what you believe in.<eos> My father sent me and my brother into the woods just before the serbs came.<eos> My mom wanted him to go, too, but he wouldn't leave her and my sister.<eos> Anyway, I joined up with a bunch of men and boys from our town and started through the woods towards where the U.N. Soldiers were.<eos> We had to cross the road to reach them, and when we did, the serbs were already there waiting for us.<eos> But they didn't know for sure who we were, so they pointed their guns at us and ordered us all, 23 of us altogether, men and boys, to drop our pants.

Can we go right now?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Dad!<eos> Mom's taking me to see a real windmill. Wanna come?<eos> Evan... listen... we're not your real parents.<eos> Everyone's supposed to have a mother and father.<eos> And they're supposed to love each other very much, just like you and Lana.<eos> Clark and I care about you a lot, Evan.<eos> That's what matters.<eos> If you're not my mom and dad, where are they?
What is your story, Mr. Kent?<eos> How will you affect the world around you for the generations to come?<eos> I'm not sure you can know that at 18.<eos> Tell that to Alexander the Great.<eos> Or to bring it closer to home, Lex Luthor.<eos> Now, he's not much older than you are... and yet he's turned his father's agrobusiness... into a leading defense contractor.<eos> He's gone from feeding people to killing them.<eos> And yet his "story" is that he's a white knight who's just put a small Kansas town on the map.<eos> Beware white knights, people.<eos> They don't slay dragons they train them to suit their own dark purpose.
She must have escaped while you were unconscious.<eos> Or someone helped her out.<eos> What, you think I did ?<eos> - Lex, how could I...<eos> - Clark, before I passed out,<eos> There was a light brighter than anything I've ever seen.<eos> and I could have sworn I saw you standing right in its epicenter.<eos> I was nowhere near those caves.<eos> If you weren't with your parents when the meteors hit, where have you been ?<eos> They insisted i get a head start.
No.<eos> Look,<eos> I understand that the police have their hands full, but Mr. and Mrs. Universe... they're killing people.<eos> Lois.<eos> Clark.<eos> You're okay.<eos> Yeah, you ?<eos> Yeah, i'm fine.<eos> Have you seen my parents ?<eos> They're gonna be fine.
coming that close to dying made you realize the things in your life that are important, made you the man that you are today... the man i married.<eos> medevac standing by.<eos> Roger that. please proceed with patient. over and out.<eos> now, let me get this straight.<eos> you gave up your first christmas with the girl you have loved since you spied on her through your telescope to deliver these... gifts ?<eos> yeah. i mean, well, i wasn't spying on her.<eos> look, i wasn't the only one. my friend chloe, she gave up her plans, too.<eos> i mean, someone had to do it.<eos> otherwise those kids wouldn't have gotten their presents.<eos> they're the ones who really need them.
She's not acting like herself. She took off down the stairs.<eos> I-I'm fine.<eos> Dad, I need you to get something for me.<eos> You're all gonna pay.<eos> Now, that's what I call a torch.<eos> How did you do that?<eos> I know it's you, Dawn.<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> All those years I kept trying to be what everyone else wanted, and it turns out those losers don't even care.<eos> This was supposed to be the best night of my life, and they laughed at me.
We work together usually and I want her back.<eos> Save your anger, save your fear.<eos> Patch the CCTV footage straight through to the grid, get me Tomahawk on a secure line. Red flash the entire team.<eos> Adam, I want you to get down there as soon as possible.<eos> Save your fear, your disillusion, your anger.<eos> You ready? Yeah.<eos> I'll take you out and present you.<eos> There's a room put aside after for press interviews.<eos> Six councillors in East London have defected to the British Way.<eos> They've got control of the Housing Committee and have a policy of whites first, or "Families United", as they call it.
And you want to freeze him. Go, go!<eos> You're on a roll.<eos> Based on the report, the only thing that we do know about this Khalek, is that physiologically he may be very much like the Priors of the Ori.<eos> An advanced form of Human, far along in evolutionary development.<eos> First and foremost, studying him, may be the key to learning a way to fight the Priors.<eos> Actually, that had not escaped me.<eos> Not to mention the fact that he may be the missing link between ourselves and ascension.<eos> Certainly that merits more research.<eos> The members of the committee feel very strongly about this.<eos> Then neither they nor you understand the risks.
As a result of these numbers, as of 0800 this morning, the President has ordered that all borders in the United States be closed until further notice.<eos> All inbound planes and ships and other traffic, will be ordered to divert to alternate destinations.<eos> Our country is now entirely under quarantine.<eos> You cannot ratify this proposal until all members of this council have been heard from!<eos> - So far six regional members...<eos> - You merely seek to delay the inevitable.<eos> If and when all Jaffa wish to embrace the Ori, then we shall act accordingly.<eos> If our brothers refuse to accept Origin into their hearts, then they seal their own fate.<eos> We cannot turn our backs on our own salvation because of indecisiveness.<eos> And they will see their way to the path.
He has returned!<eos> The Prior of the Ori has returned!<eos> You go ahead Daniel.<eos> Please, you must save us.<eos> Forgive those blinded by ignorance.<eos> People are dying.<eos> Our children are dying.<eos> They will believe. They do believe.<eos> Still, not all of you.<eos> They are not of us!

Do ya? Forget it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We'll dial you another address, you can go through, but we're not taking you home.<eos> You are aware of the fact that we have a lot of weapons pointed at you, right?<eos> Yeah, well you're gonna murder us the minute we step through the Gate anyway, so what difference does it make?<eos> That's very distrustful.<eos> Wait! Look!<eos> We've got a Wraith cruiser headed for the island and I'm picking up several more on approach outside the atmosphere.<eos> Go to stealth mode.<eos> Let's find our guys, before they do.
We don't know enough about Wraith physiology to say for certain.<eos> Although I must admit, it's intriguing that this Dr Zaddik... claims that this Wraith survived on normal food for a time.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, if he's telling the truth, it might be the answer to a very puzzling question.<eos> Right now, our best guess is that the Wraith evolved from the Eratus Bug.<eos> Like the one that attached itself to my neck a year ago?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - I hate those bugs.<eos> Trust me, I know.<eos> We speculated that they evolved into the Wraith when they began to take on the characteristics... of the humans they are feeding on.
10 generations ago, after a severe culling, the brotherhood was destroyed.<eos> Many of us found their writings and decided to try and complete the task handed down to us by the Ancestors. I am the new master handler.<eos> We thank you for helping us find the potentia, but it must go into hiding again.<eos> We come from the city of the Ancestors. That ZPM was intended for us. No.<eos> You live in Atlantis, but you are not the Ancestors.<eos> What'd you tell her?<eos> Atlantis might fall if we don't take this ZPM back.<eos> Then it would serve no purpose. Do you really think the Ancestors would have wanted that?<eos> None of us can know their plan. They don't have a plan.<eos> Do you think getting attacked by the Wraith and chased out of the galaxy is something they planned for?
You're saying Teyla is part Wraith?<eos> A very small part.<eos> Which makes her about as different from us as you, because of the ancient gene you possess.<eos> Well, and some other things.<eos> Still, Bates is going to go nuts over this.<eos> Let's just keep this one under our hat.<eos> Well, obviously Teyla is very concerned about how everyone will react.<eos> What, so you think this Wraith scientist was trying to make humans what, more tasty?<eos> The log seems to indicate that he was looking for a way to make the feeding process more efficient.<eos> I thought you already said they had a number of genetic characteristics similar to humans.
Very polite, very courteous, but completely uninterested in having anything to do with us.<eos> Well better that than hostile, I suppose.<eos> Colonel Sheppard's team.<eos> Three hours overdue.<eos> It wouldn't be the first time.<eos> Any radio contact?<eos> None since they left.<eos> Well, you know those guys.<eos> What do I know about those guys?<eos> Just that they tend to get all caught up in whatever it is they're doing and sometimes they don't check in.
So please answer Dr Weir's question.<eos> - Is that a threat, Major?<eos> - No, sir. You need a clear chain of command, but if you cut Dr Weir out of the loop, you'll alienate the people whose trust she's earned, which is everyone on the base, including me.<eos> Is that a fact?<eos> Have a seat.<eos> I should be in that meeting.<eos> I am the expert on defence capabilities.<eos> When the military steps in, scientists take a back seat.<eos> Till they need us.<eos> They don't think they need us, till they need us!
So this is one of their outposts?<eos> Yet the Ancestors made no mention of their presence here, in the database.<eos> Why?<eos> - Well, let's find out.<eos> Can you power it up?<eos> - Working on it.<eos> I got two bodies here.<eos> I got three more over here.<eos> Whatever happened here, no-one came back to claim the dead.<eos> I can't tell if they were fed on by the Wraith.
Don't sugar coat this, Rodney.<eos> The Ancient scientists running Arcturus were rushed into testing before they had perfected a means of effectively controlling the power output.<eos> I believe, if they'd had more time, history would have played out differently on that planet. Possibly in this galaxy.<eos> I won't deny that this is something that we'd dearly love to get our hands on, but the Ancients were a pretty bright bunch.<eos> And desperate and losing a war they'd already been fighting for a hundred years.<eos> More importantly, they were, they were like this close.<eos> And you believe you can finish their work?<eos> I do.<eos> We do.<eos> They do.
Yeah, me too.<eos> Especially after my mum caught us in bed together.<eos> Yes. Easily the most mortifying moment of my life to date.<eos> - Did she got mental?<eos> - Well, we didn't speak for a while.<eos> Then I thought, "Fuck, what's the worst that can happen?" So we chatted and we both cried.<eos> Then I got the usual shit. "What about the grandchildren?"<eos> Things calmed down, and that Christmas I got a turkey baster in my stocking.<eos> How are your parents about things?<eos> Oh, to be honest, they've got their own preoccupations.
-Kat!<eos> - - Get me out of here!<eos> - Kat.<eos> It's not gonna hurt you!<eos> Listen to me! You have to face it.<eos> -You have to calm down.<eos> -She's gotta what?<eos> -l have to what?<eos> -The spirits.<eos> They're not hurting us.
Kat?<eos> Man, I hope you're right about this.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> Kat.<eos> One thirty-seven. - -Sorry?<eos> It whispered in my ear, 137.<eos> Room number.<eos> So if these spirits aren't trying to hurt anyone--<eos> -Then what are they trying to do?<eos> -Maybe they've been trying to tell us.
If you ask me, Mary spent her last living moments trying to expose this guy's secret.<eos> But she never could.<eos> Where's she buried?<eos> She wasn't. She was cremated.<eos> What about that mirror?<eos> It's not in some evidence lockup, is it?<eos> No.<eos> It was returned to Mary's family a long time ago.<eos> You have the names of her family, by any chance?<eos> You bring these strangers into my house and they ask me things like that?
-Yeah.<eos> -Maybe it's not murder.<eos> This was 1 981 , "Constance Welch, 24 years old jumps off Sylvania Bridge.<eos> Drowns in the river."<eos> -Does it say why she did it?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -What?<eos> -Before they found her, she calls 91 1 .<eos> Her two kids are in the bathtub.<eos> She leaves them alone and when she comes back, they aren't breathing.
Well, I-I just--<eos> I meant that I'm looking forward to it, you know, next year when I'm in your grade.<eos> Well, if you have any problems, just give me a call.<eos> Mr. Mirasko's a real tool.<eos> So you think maybe I could come over to Phil's later, see your new bud?<eos> Uh, I'm not so sure that's a good idea.<eos> You know what our problem is?<eos> Language.<eos> I mean, how many misunderstandings and fights and wars get started because human beings say the wrong thing at the wrong time, you know?<eos> Whereas animals, they can't talk.

He's a menace, man.<eos> no,he's not.<eos> He just ate amber lou's dog, dude!<eos> That's bad!<eos> - "If found,please call" - we don't need to call.<eos> People are gonna find out.<eos> Like your parents.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey,maybe I'll come clean.<eos> You know, maybe they'll just let me keep him.
You guys, donna's totally freaking out about this africa thing.<eos> She won't return any of my calls.<eos> Think I have a solution.<eos> The dark room switch.<eos> Look, man, tell donna to just lay off, okay ?<eos> Africa is gonna be awesome.<eos> You know, they have this bug over there that burrows into your brain, and it lays, like, a thousand eggs.<eos> And then when the eggs hatch, they, like, shoot out of your head like little worm bullets.<eos> Kelso, those worms aren't in africa.<eos> They're on the planet zorgon, which is from a comic book that you wrote.
no way.<eos> That's funny. It looks like a normal gym, but apparently I've stumbled into the mouth of hell.<eos> The coach needed someone to fill in, so he called the best quarterback that point place high ever had.<eos> And I figured, you know, the cheerleaders... they practice in here, so it'd give me a good chance to see what's gonna be on the market in a couple years.<eos> I can't believe that you get to decide whether or not I graduate high school.<eos> Well, look, I tell you what, you give me one pull-up over there, I'll tell the school you passed.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, let's get this done, foreplay. Get over there.<eos> Hey, pinciotti, you see all these eighth grade boys checking you out ?<eos> No, they're not.
Thanks, man.<eos> hi, boys.<eos> I brought you a housewarming gift... glass grapes !<eos> every so often, someone tries to eat one.<eos> It's a real conversation-starter.<eos> I remember.<eos> Hmm, you know, it looks like you might need some help unpacking.<eos> Kitty, no !<eos> Oh, just sit. I'll just be a minute.<eos> But remember, you are a guest in these kids' home, just like they've been a guest in our home for years.

I can never stop dancing entirely.<eos> you know what, leo ?<eos> This is my first truck stop, and I love it.<eos> It's like, how do you find this golden oasis ?<eos> I woke up in the parking lot once.<eos> And these truckers, they're like... they seem like great salt of the earth guys, you know ?<eos> Hey !<eos> Ten-four, good buddies !<eos> Oh, oh, crap, they're looking at me.<eos> No, they're looking at me, man.
Okay.<eos> I think it's obvious what happened to eric.<eos> We got an abandoned car, a flat tire and footprints heading off in that direction.<eos> Mrs. Forman, your son's been kidnapped by coyotes.<eos> Isn't it more likely that he had a flat tire, couldn't change it himself and went off to find some help ?<eos> And the coyotes got him along the way.<eos> Yeah, now you're thinking like a cop.<eos> I can't believe I'm stuckin a backwoods truck stop with no money.<eos> You know, if we don't do something, this waitress is just gonna hand us over to these truckers.<eos> You know, they're all freaky sexual deviants.
All I remember is flushing it down the toilet when he killed it.<eos> Who takes a fish out of the tank ?<eos> I just needed to hug something.<eos> Why do think kelso didn't choose us ?<eos> Well, picking godparents can be very nerve-racking.<eos> When laurie was born, we agonized over that decision for weeks.<eos> And we chose well.<eos> Mike and cookie were good people.<eos> Wait, so who are my godparents ?<eos> Well, they're the... the hoffenschloffers.
That... you two should be roommates.<eos> - Oh, thanks, but we already thought of that.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> All right, why did you choose them over us ?<eos> Is it 'cause I don't have a job ?<eos> Is it because I dyed my hair ?<eos> Look, I don't have a job because hyde turned me into a burnout.<eos> And I dyed my hair because jackie destroyed my self-esteem.<eos> Also, I rock as a blonde.<eos> Are you beginning to see the influence that they have on people ?
Let me guess. Twelve?<eos> Tim passed out at the eleventh.<eos> All the other pledges freaked out and left me there to take care of him.<eos> So I took him to the hospital as fast as I could.<eos> If they're so secret, how do you know all this?<eos> My dad was a Triton.<eos> So were my two older brothers.<eos> All I cared about at that moment was staying on their good side.<eos> If they found out that I betrayed their secrets... I'd be better off in jail.<eos> They will destroy your life.
What other way?<eos> That a pimp tricking $80 hookers showed up out of the goodness of his heart to save two rich white boys from doing time.<eos> But there's still the gun.<eos> Nothing ties it to the defendants.<eos> We all saw it in the hands of the guy running from the motel.<eos> The gun belonged to Anissa.<eos> This should be good.<eos> We know she has a firearms rap.<eos> Parole in those cases forbids you to own a gun.<eos> The boys attack her, she pulls the gun, they flee.
The object is to beat the other guys.<eos> We are all getting beaten on security.<eos> It's like these debate rules.<eos> If all of us were better, maybe one of us would finally break through.<eos> And did I just see chickens on CNN up in my hotel room?<eos> This may not be the best time, but we have to get over to the court.<eos> -It closes in an hour.<eos> -We are not going to any cou- - Chickens?<eos> I had the lawyers finish the brief.<eos> They're waiting.
Hang on.<eos> Actually, that was... our own tracking in Maine now has Santos ahead by three.<eos> George, I'm telling you, he would love to meet with the reverends but there's no way I can pull him off the campaign trail and get him to Atlanta.<eos> Georgia's not a swing state.<eos> He's ahead by 20 points there.<eos> I understand:<eos> the reverends don't want to look like they're begging.<eos> Right, but you have to understand my position here.<eos> Okay, why don't you come over here tonight and have the meeting for them?<eos> They preserve their dignity, I preserve my campaign schedule, and we do a little business.
All right.<eos> We'll talk about our ad buy after the dinner.<eos> We'll see you in there, Congressman.<eos> I hope you're going to give a tough speech on partial-birth abortion tonight.<eos> These folks need to hear it.<eos> This story about the Women's Alliance won't even endorse you. It's a disaster.<eos> Because I'd get more votes for a position I happen to hold?<eos> You can't let this communion thing bother you.<eos> Most Catholics are pro-choice.<eos> How do bishops expect politicians to do what they can't do in their own church?
There are plumbers in the country who make a better living than dentists.<eos> Now, I'm not talking about lowering our ambitions I'm talking about targeting our ambitions correctly.<eos> It's true, some other countries are doing better academically than they used to.<eos> But we still have the best scientists in the world the best doctors, the best... By far, the most Nobel Prizes.<eos> And if a kid does well in one of those foreign high schools guess where he or she wants to go to college.<eos> That's right, Harvard, Stanford, Caltech, University of Texas and a hundred other American universities that are better than anything they have in their countries.<eos> Now, if we're going to have a practical approach to education we're going to have to admit that not everyone can go to MIT.<eos> But most of the kids who do go to MIT come from American public schools.<eos> So give up on Head Start, just give up on early education and then give up on those kids who don't test well.<eos> - "They'll find their way."
! This Wendell is teaching the McFarland Method?<eos> He's stealing from me!<eos> This is identity theft, the most heinous of crimes!<eos> - Here are your sweaters, Mr. Truman<eos> - Thank you We just need a signature<eos> Oh, my God, I think I see them All the way-<eos> - All the way up on top<eos> Okay, I'll get a salesperson<eos> No. No, no I hate salespeople<eos> What, I do all the work and they get all the credit?
They're getting away with it.<eos> Why change MO?<eos> Hello, Julie.<eos> Can you tell me what this is?<eos> OK. This is the website for Collingwood Community Circle.<eos> Julie Fletcher's church group.<eos> Most of the website is Christian propaganda, but a couple of layers down, and you get this.<eos> Dennis Garden.<eos> It's a peer-moderated chat room.<eos> Kids with problems talk to other kids with problem, so they don't feel alone.
It was only a matter of time till word spread to Pelosi that he'd made him a lot of money.<eos> Plan practically wrote itself.<eos> Now, I don't know if you know this or not but Jimmy took me down to your place in Medford a while back.<eos> Now, I'm not trying to tell you how to run your business or anything but you could do better.<eos> You didn't have a good enough time?<eos> No, Mr. Pelosi, I did.<eos> Believe me.<eos> You have a beautiful bunch of girls down there.<eos> But, see, the problem is the properties you use.<eos> Not only are they low end, but they're as hard as hell to get to.
You're slick, you know that?<eos> Go ahead, drive on!<eos> Hey Kim, what is it?<eos> May I see it?<eos> Don't be silly.<eos> He's a cute guy, and the district's top athlete too!<eos> Come on, knock it off!<eos> Kim, watch out, Kaew is right there.<eos> There are kids everywhere here.<eos> Oh, they're just here to help the teacher check the homework.
- Come and take a look at this!<eos> - This is absolutely magnificent.<eos> - Isn't it?<eos> - What is it?<eos> - It's a pectoral.<eos> What the pharaoh wore around his neck.<eos> Pure gold.<eos> You won't find many of them in Tiffany's.<eos> You see, pharaohs were considered semi-divine by the ancient Egyptians and gold represented the flesh of the gods.<eos> Something like this, I guess, must have reminded them that they were kind of holy.
Other foragers from the same nest have found another. During the next few weeks, as many as half a dozen may be taken back to the nest.<eos> Here they are hauled down to the nursery chambers and put with the ants' other eggs and larvae. And because the caterpillars continue to produce a pheromone exactly like that produced by the young ants themselves, they are treated as if they were young ants.<eos> Even though they are bigger and a different colour. The caterpillars even mimic the sound the ants make when they beg for food, so the workers dutifully feed and clean them.<eos> You might think that this caterpillar has protected itself very well by deceiving these ants.<eos> But life in the undergrowth is full of surprises.<eos> Somehow or other, in a meadow full of ants' nests, it can detect which one harbours a butterfly caterpillar, and this, it decides, is one of those.<eos> Once inside, the ants start to attack it, as you might expect.<eos> But then, the ants' behaviour changes. There is pandemonium.<eos> With the defenders fighting among themselves, the wasp is able to go deeper into the nest. It's reached the nursery and here lie the caterpillars.<eos> Now they are defenceless. The wasp sets about injecting each of them with an egg.
This is what I'm here to stop.<eos> Come on, Butters. This psychic boy and his ghost pal are going to save the day!<eos> Stay back, people!<eos> Stay back? !<eos> Hell, my wife and child are in there!<eos> Stay calm in there. We don't want anybody getting hurt.<eos> You get us a helicopter and two hundred thousand dollars or these people start dyin', man!<eos> All right, Butters, 'm going in alone, first. Give me thirty seconds in there, and then you go in and free the hostages.<eos> Go in there?<eos> Uh, but they'll see me.
The Colorado Little League State Championship is being played this week.<eos> Two teams of youngsters get to go head to head at the major-league stadium downtown.<eos> Tom, I'm standing here with the little sluggers and some of their parents, and I can;t tell you how excited they are.<eos> I don't suppose you guys want to win this game. Win?<eos> Why the hell would we want to win?<eos> Then we'd have to play this boring game all summer.<eos> Little Stan Marsh is the pitcher for the South Park Little League team, and Stan, how does it feel to be playing for the State Championship?<eos> Gay.<eos> Mr. Marsh, you must be very proud of your son.<eos> They've worked really hard to get here, Chris,and, you know, I don't like to really "trash-talk," but, I don't think Denver has a chance.
Dewey and I finally came up with something good enough for that insane voice in your head.<eos> -Here, put this on first.<eos> -Roman candles?<eos> Well, that's how they started off.<eos> You're gonna light it, and then get up on the board and jump.<eos> Do you care if you keep your eyebrows?<eos> -Hell, no!<eos> Okay, the fuse is timed for 20 seconds.<eos> The rockets should kick in around there.<eos> They won't give you any momentum, but they will ignite that.
And then an angel appears. A hitchhiker.<eos> It's the real James Brighton.<eos> James is wise and sophisticated. He was born in England. He is experienced, and knows who he is.<eos> Matthewfalls madly in love with him, as one can only with a stranger.<eos> JAMES AND LOVE? .<eos> They head out again, driving back roads.<eos> James enjoys showing Matthew an America he doesn't know.<eos> And then Matthew, who until recently never acted impulsively, who weighed his every gesture, and avoided every potential risk, now does something without thinking. He stops to help three men whose car has broken down.<eos> They're drunk. Three men headed to Montreal for the weekend to party.<eos> They make homophobic comments. They look at Matthew, who says nothing. His silence puts him in their camp.
Fuck off!<eos> What if we're dealing with a bunch of mosquitoes that flew too close to a nuclear power station and got radioactively-enhanced super mosquito powers, eh?<eos> Well, there goes that theory.<eos> Okay, results.<eos> Whose dumb idea was that?<eos> What do you know about mosquito genes?<eos> Which one?<eos> They have about 14,000 of them.<eos> Seems to me we're missing the obvious.<eos> I mean, mosquitoes use an anticoagulant to keep your blood from clotting while they take it.
I need something to calm my stomach.<eos> I should take it with a meal.<eos> But here's Mr. Homer, my favorite customer!<eos> Please take a Playboy, and tell me to return to a country I am not originating.<eos> Why this tone Apu charmer?<eos> Looking for médoc 'Cheap?<eos> Please let me participate in one of your travel contraband.<eos> My 8 babies make me crazy!<eos> they cough, sneezes, and make noise!<eos> They fear my concierge who dares get out!
Is that right, you're a friend?<eos> Can I sit down?<eos> Look... my boss... district attorney Ned Mace... wants me to reassure you that we're doin' everything we can to protect you.<eos> Oh, yeah, protect us from what?<eos> Michael Caffee and Pete McGonagle are very dangerous men, Deena.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> No kiddin'.<eos> The lunatics tried to blow Charlie's head off.<eos> Word is probably out that you're pressing' charges against Michael and Pete.<eos> Now, there's a very good chance that they could do somethin' to hurt Charlie so that you won't testify.

But there's one condition.<eos> What?<eos> That you go to bed early.<eos> It's crucial that you recover.<eos> Yes?<eos> I'm putting my pencils and rubbers away like a good pupil.<eos> Good pupils look after their school things.<eos> I went to the laboratory where Elina Andrescu worked.<eos> And?<eos> - They hated her.
Get eveyone, don't spare anyone.<eos> Go inside...go inside boy!<eos> I'm scared.<eos> - No...don't get scared.<eos> Don't come out, stay put here.<eos> How dare to rebel against Baji Rao?<eos> Bloody, I'll rip out your skin.<eos> There are two children in that hut, pick them also.<eos> This van is full I'm putting them in th! at van.<eos> They'll not reform unless we do like this.
AII right, congratulations.<eos> As you sit here and take in the final odor of your senior class...<eos> We are sure there are many questions still burning through your minds.<eos> Will I find my place in the world?<eos> And more importantly...<eos> Who are these two attractive individuals and how long do we have the privilege of listening to them?<eos> As much as this day is for you, it's also for your parents.<eos> They sit in this gym today pondering the possibilities that lay ahead of us...<eos> And at the same time, are apprehensive about letting us go.<eos> They stood behind us for the past 1 8 years...

So the key to unlocking the mystery of these strange paintings in the mountains seems to be lost forever,<eos> There seemed no way of getting that because those who made the paintings were extinct.<eos> But then, far away from the Drakensberg,<eos> Lewis Williams found the first clue,<eos> It was the start of a trail that would eventually lead him all the way back to the prehistoric cave paintings of Europe,<eos> Although there are no bushmen today who remember when their people painted on rock, there were some still alive at the end of the 19th century.<eos> Thankfully, the stories that they had to tell were written down and preserved.<eos> They're kept here, at an archive in Cape Town.<eos> At the end of the 19th century, a German settler, Wilhelm Bleek, discovered there were still some San bushmen alive who had lived around the Drakensberg,<eos> Bleek realised that they opened a rare window onto the past,
There's an insect in this garden that all gardeners loathe... aphids.<eos> They've made enemies of gardeners, but in the undergrowth they have friends... ants.
There's an insect in this garden that all gardeners loathe... aphids.<eos> They've made enemies of gardeners, but in the undergrowth they have friends... ants.<eos> Ants herd aphids to the best possible feeding places just as human shepherds will herd their sheep to the best pastures. And just as shepherds protect their flocks against wolves so ants protect the aphids against their insect enemies.<eos> Ladybirds are among the most dangerous. They, after all, eat aphids. So the ants must get rid of them.<eos> That's not easy. It's quite hard to get a grip on the polished shell of a ladybird.<eos> But eventually, success.<eos> Aphids excrete a liquid that ants relish, honeydew.<eos> That's why ants protect them.<eos> Such close relationships are frequent among insects, perhaps because they've had so long to develop them.<eos> They appeared on land, after all, about a hundred million years before any backboned animal. And they can also evolve much faster because they can produce several generations within a single year.
And this is it. It's rather difficult to see because it looks exactly like a dried leaf, but it's a stick insect.<eos> There's its head, antennae, and that's the tip of its abdomen. As an adult, like this, it spends all its time up in the trees eating leaves.<eos> And when the time comes to lay, and this one is doing so, all she does is simply to flick away the egg, and let it fall to the ground.<eos> But that's not quite as risky as you might think.<eos> Wherever you are, you can be pretty sure that some ants will turn up looking for food. And that is exactly what the stick insect's eggs look like.<eos> A nutritious seed, complete with that fatty capsule at the tip. So the ants start to haul them away.<eos> Although the ants certainly eat a great number of the seeds they store, stick insect eggs don't seem to be quite as tempting.<eos> At any rate, the ants, after all their labour, usually leave the stick insect eggs untouched.<eos> While the seasons pass, the eggs lie underground, hidden from birds and any other predators that might eat them.<eos> They may remain there, safe, for up to three years, but eventually they hatch.
She packs it into baskets on her back legs and takes it back to her burrow.<eos> It'll provide valuable food for her young when they eventually hatch.<eos> And here comes a male. He's on the lookout for a female.<eos> To him, the cluster not only looks like a female, it smells like a female. For the beetle larvae are producing a perfume, a pheromone, that is exactly like that emitted by a female bee.<eos> He alights in order to mate, and in seconds is covered by the larvae that swarm all over him.<eos> At first, he seems stunned by the shock of his sudden increase in weight.<eos> But then he's off again.<eos> Now his luck improves. This really is a female.<eos> And while he mates, his passengers jump ship.<eos> Now they're all on board a female bee.
But I can use this special optical probe to see whether anyone's at home.<eos> And there it is.<eos> It's a scorpion.<eos> They won't come out for the rest of the day.<eos> But at night, when it gets cool, scorpions all over the desert will be emerging.<eos> And then, we have a very special way of finding them.<eos> In ultraviolet light scorpions are magically transformed.<eos> They glow with fluorescence.<eos> So with an ultraviolet torch you can get a better idea of just how abundant scorpions are, even in this arid wilderness.<eos> That's because they have managed to develop external skeletons that are virtually watertight.
This contains more sugar than the aphids need, so the ants drink the excess. And they collect it just as fast as the aphids excrete it.<eos> They carry it back to the nest but in this case they transport it inside their swollen stomachs.<eos> In fact, this liquid, honeydew, makes up more than two thirds of the colony's diet.<eos> All these wood ant nests are connected to one another by trails.<eos> And, indeed, they're also genetically related to one another.<eos> There are some 1,200 of them in this one patch of forest and that makes this what is thought to be the biggest supercolony of ants in the whole world.<eos> By mid June, the supercolony is ready to reproduce.<eos> Out of every nest, among the workers, come individuals with wings.<eos> Some nests produce only males.<eos> They take off in droves.
There may be several dozen of them. She checks that the drop has dried.<eos> She adds more fuzzy silk to protect it and its vulnerable contents from knocks and bumps.<eos> Then she changes silk and starts to spin a tougher kind to cover the whole capsule.<eos> She cuts the platform free from its attachments and goes round it, pinching the cut edges firmly together.<eos> Finally, she covers the whole parcel with a waterproof silken wrapping.<eos> She now carries her precious package with her wherever she goes.<eos> She seeks out patches of sunlight so that she can warm it and speed the development of the eggs within.<eos> It's a long process that may last several weeks.<eos> And then, at last, her babies are sufficiently developed to leave their nursery.<eos> But, even now, she doesn't abandon them. They climb up her legs and onto her back. The egg capsule is now empty and can be discarded.

He was wearing a hat covered with aluminum foil.<eos> And also... he had a long coat covered with aluminum foil.<eos> And for some reason, Kana told me... that the man was of no threat to her...<eos> On the day that Kana disappeared...<eos> We found this strange flier.<eos> It was placed face down.<eos> It says, "Help." I think this is Kana's handwriting.<eos> See what Kana drew on this?<eos> Has she always drawn this kind of pattern?<eos> "Kana's parents said they'd never seen anything like this before."
For 5 days she was repeatedly asked where her husband was, but always replied that he was dead.<eos> Then, on the morning of the 6th day, the soldiers of the intelligence Corps attempted to trick her into telling more.<eos> Captain William Cross, the Commanding Officer of 92 Field Security Section, later revealed how the interrogation went.<eos> thinking she was saving her son, Frau Hoss now revealed the truth.<eos> Soldiers of British 92 Field Security Section moved up to the farm she`d identified at 1 1 o`clocK that night.<eos> Get him up!<eos> Steh auf!<eos> Steh auf!<eos> Franz Lang<eos> They Knew the crimes Hoss had committed, and were not inclined to restrain themselves.
You imply with your question thatjust being a member of a large group of people who lived in a garrison where the destruction of the Jews took place is enough to make you a criminal.<eos> oskar Groning did much more than simply<eos> `live in a garrison where the destruction of the Jews took place`.<eos> like every one of the SS at Auschwitz he actively participated in the running of the camp.<eos> oskar Groning counted the foreign currency stolen from the Jews and transported it to Berlin, and he guarded the belongings of the Jews in the immediate aftermath of their arrival.<eos> But others did have a much more intimate connection with the Killing process.<eos> And many of them were not even Nazis.<eos> Because a crematorium like this was normally operated by no more than 4 members of the SS - and a hundred prisoners of the SonderKommando.<eos> They were forced to do this, if they didn`t do this then they would be immediately taken to the gas chambers.<eos> So in order to have a chance of a little bit more life they did the function.
A place they can trust their husbands to bring the kids to.<eos> A place the whole family can visit on the weekends.<eos> And?<eos> When the fathers come, all they do is look bored.<eos> So how about a special area for the fathers?<eos> We have an area for them on the rooftop.<eos> No, I'm not talking about that.<eos> They could use a space where they could relax comfortably.<eos> Fathers could come and meet other fathers.<eos> And they could have a good time socializing with each other.
Let's go to Grandma's house.<eos> Don't you dare think about seeing her again!<eos> Mother!<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> It's just as I said.<eos> Se-jin has a man.<eos> Why stir up such trouble after hearing a senseless rumor?<eos> What?<eos> You should trust your children.<eos> They said it's not true, so why believe others?
Well, many of them couldn't get academic jobs and the political science and philosophy faclities were not terribly friendly to those of a conservative or moderately conservative disposition.<eos> And the truth is that a lot of people who ended up in Washington started out as academics. I did;<eos> Paul Wolfowitz did;<eos> and decided they probably didn't have very good prospects in the academy.<eos> What we all had in common, I think was a certain doubt about what once seemed a kind of great certainty and confidence in liberal progress.<eos> The philosophic grounds for liberal democracy had been weakened.<eos> So I think Straussians who came to Washington they didn't think of themselves as Churchill or Lincoln let me assure you, but they did that, you know there's something noble about public life, and about politics<eos> and they tried to make a contribution in many different areas.<eos> The neoconservatives were idealists.<eos> Their aim was to try and stop the social disintegration they believed liberal freedoms had unleashed.
Under such intense lobbying<eos> Reagan agreed to give the neoconservatives what they wanted and in 1983 he signed a secret document that fundamentally changed American foreign policy.<eos> The country would now fund covert wars to push back the hidden Soviet threat around the world.<eos> The specter of Marxist-Leninist controlled governments with ideological and political loytities to the Soviet Union proves that there's a direct challenge to which we must respond.<eos> They are the focus of evil in the modern world.<eos> It was a triumph for the neoconservatives.<eos> America was now setting out to do battle against the forces of evil in the world.<eos> But what had started out as the kind of myth that Leo Strauss had said was necessary for the American people increasingly came to be seen as the truth by the neoconservatives.<eos> They began to believe their own fiction.<eos> They had become what they called "democratic revolutionaries," who were going to use force to change the world.
But that's what we were about, and that's what we're still about.<eos> When you say you were democratic revolutionaries what do you mean?<eos> It meant that we wanted to support the people who wanted to carry out revolutions against tyrannical regimes in the name of democracy in order to install a democratic system. As simple as that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's not nuclear physics, you know.<eos> I mean, freedom is a fairly simple thing to get.<eos> It's a chancy job - makes a man watchful and a little lonely.<eos> But somebody has to do it.<eos> The neoconservatives now set out to transform the world.<eos> In next week's episode, they find themselves joining forces with the Islamists in Afghanistan and together they fight an epic battle against the Soviet Union.
The real Islamic front!<eos> We are here!<eos> The real Islamic front and the real Islamic opposition against Zionist. We are here!<eos> The real Islamic front against Zionism, Communism, and imperialism.<eos> Ayman Zawahiri was a follower of the Egyptian revolutionary Sayyed Qutb who had been executed in 1966.<eos> As last week's program showed<eos> Qutb believed that the liberal ideas of Western societies corrupted the minds of Muslims because they unleashed the most selfish aspects of human nature.<eos> Zawahiri had interpreted Qutb's theories to mean that this corruption included the Western system of democracy.<eos> Democracy, Zawahiri believed, encouraged politicians to set themselves up as the source of all authority and by doing this, they were rejecting the higher authority of the Koran.<eos> This meant they were no longer true Muslims, and so they and those who supported them, could legitimately be killed.
But despite all his efforts<eos> Kenneth Starr could find no incriminating evidence in Whitewater.<eos> Nor could he find any evidence to support any of the sexual scandals that had come from the Arkansas Project.<eos> Until finally, his committee stumbled upon Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky, which Clinton denied.<eos> And in that lie, the neoconservative movement believed they had found what they had been looking for:<eos> a way to make the American people see the truth about the liberal corruption of their country.<eos> A campaign now began to impeach the President.<eos> And in the hysteria, the whole conservative movement portrayed Clinton as a depraved monster who had to be removed from office.<eos> But yet again, the neoconservatives had created a fantasy enemy by exaggerating and distorting reality.<eos> They were trapped by a mythological person that they had constructed, or persons, the Clintons, these scheming, terrible people who they, the noble pursuers, were going to vanquish.
This is our calling.<eos> And the attacks had another dramatic effect:<eos> they brought the neoconservatives back to power in America<eos> When George Bush first became president he had appointed neoconservatives like Paul Wolfowitz and their allies like Donald Rumsfeld, to his administration.<eos> But their grand vision of America's role in the world was largely ignored by this new regi.<eos> I just don't think it's the role of the United States to walk into another country and say<eos> "We do it this way, so should you."<eos> But now<eos> We're going to find those who, uh, who, uh, uh, those evil doers.<eos> But now, the neoconservatives became all-powerful because this terror network proved that what they had been predicting through the 1990s was correct:

I mean... why did you leave wherever it was?<eos> - Helstone.<eos> Well, it it-it was my husband's decision.<eos> It was a matter of... of conscience.<eos> But Mr. Hale is no longer a clergyman, I thought.<eos> My husband very much enjoys his lessons with Mr. Thornton.<eos> I think it makes him feel young again.<eos> Classics are all very well for men who loiter life away in the country or in colleges.<eos> But Milton men ought to have all their energies absorbed by today's work.<eos> They should have one aim only.
- But? Well, there is a "but", in't there?<eos> But... my workers are healthier.<eos> Their lungs don't clog so easily. They work for me longer.<eos> And their children.<eos> Even you'll see profit in that.<eos> But surely, erm... it's the right path, also.<eos> Sound business sense, Mr. Hale, and I cannot operate under any other moral law.<eos> I do not run a charitable institution.<eos> My workers expect me to be hard, but truthful.<eos> I tell them how things are and they take it or leave it.
- You've all heard it before!<eos> - Aye, the bosses make their own rules!<eos> Henderson says one thing, Hamper another!<eos> Different from one week t' next!<eos> - What's to stop 'em cutting pay again?<eos> - Aye!<eos> And if we quit over wages, there's more'll take our places!<eos> That is why we must all work together, because next time one of our bosses plays tricks, we'll all know about it.<eos> And if we all decide on a fair wage, and none of us work for less, then for once, WE'LL have a say!<eos> What if they don't like it, eh?
We have an approximate dating.<eos> - They must be identified quickly. - I asked SKL to test the mitochondrial DNA.<eos> (SKL - National Laboratory of Forensic Science)<eos> To determine parentage.<eos> It takes a long time.<eos> But the information is useful if we are to move forward.<eos> - What else?<eos> - How complete are the skeletons?<eos> They are missing pieces.<eos> And the quicklime occurred after they were tossed into the grave ...

- Where?<eos> - Under the bed.<eos> It could be quicklime.<eos> - We don't have a search warrant.<eos> - Go and talk a bit with her.<eos> The whole area was built for the brick factory employees. As a recreation area.<eos> But when they closed down we wanted to buy the cabins.<eos> - The entire building is empty now?<eos> - Yes.<eos> There were a few small businesses there, they used it mostly as a warehouse.
That's enough!<eos> Wait outside.<eos> I said wait outside!<eos> Why'd they smash your violin?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Same for everything.<eos> Same for Massi's death.<eos> Same for your father's body.<eos> Our parents told us nothing.<eos> They tell us nothing.

She was devastated after she left you.<eos> She seems pretty happy with this Chandler guy.<eos> - Mercenary little prick.<eos> - You've met him.<eos> I'm working for... this is strictly confidential, by the way... a close friend of your employer.<eos> The Pilager family?<eos> Look, I only want to know if any of your workers are missing.<eos> What, these guys?<eos> They're all missing.<eos> They don't exist, right?
Vince Esparza.<eos> Man, you a legend.<eos> People say you got crews working all over the county.<eos> People say a lot of shit that isn't necessarily true.<eos> I'm looking for a guy named Lázaro Huerta.<eos> I don't keep track of their names.<eos> I'm not runnin' a summer camp here.<eos> Would you mind if I was to ask your jornaleros a few questions?<eos> Yeah, I would mind.<eos> They're here to work.
Lupe!<eos> Here, let me help you with this.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - How would you like to make $200?<eos> They said these two men, Rafi and Fito... have gone to the church.<eos> It's not Sunday.<eos> The day of the dead.<eos> Tell 'em I came instead ofTony.<eos> They don't trust you.<eos> Tell them I have their names and that if they want to stay in this country...
Keep silent if you're captured. Dismiss.<eos> Ready for inspection.<eos> Listen up, boys.<eos> If you can fight the pirates like you fought the police, then you're sure to win.<eos> We're sure to win.<eos> We built five ships, why are there only three?<eos> Governor, the other two are submerged.<eos> I thought we couldn't see them because they were submarines!<eos> Three ships will be too crowded.<eos> They may be overcrowded, but it shouldn't be a problem.
Don't you know the way?<eos> I'm new here.<eos> I've not been there before.<eos> So, you don't know me?<eos> No!<eos> What's your name?<eos> Don't ask my name.<eos> Take them to the storeroom.<eos> But you said the rifles would get rusty in there.<eos> They can be polished, right?
But to who worries him...<eos> These will be good days to do sport..<eos> Good because, I am José Velázquez... and this was, "Good morning report"<eos> The water continues dripping...<eos> Try to close this but it continues leaving..<eos> Please Mr. Tim when he has time<eos> I will thank for this him...<eos> I said this in the conference of press... and now I speak this other time..<eos> "I never went... against those illegal workers...<eos> They were contracted for my part of back...
# And lasting peace<eos> # And on a great white horse<eos> # He'd ride away with me...<eos> Uno, dos, tres, cuatro.<eos> Uno, dos, tres, cuatro!<eos> I had a good time tonight.<eos> Don't sound so surprised.<eos> You are the best!<eos> He's got your eyes.<eos> They pull you.
I can't reveal information about our sources.<eos> The source is the Centre Party.<eos> Who was it?<eos> Dreier?<eos> Peter Schou?<eos> And you never wondered why?<eos> You just thanked them?<eos> The top brass say be friendly with the legislative powers<eos> I really don't know why.<eos> They only run our budget.
Can I quote you on that?<eos> Are you having trouble hearing me?<eos> I don't mind repeating it, if you're that slow.<eos> Lone has my full support.<eos> - And now I<eos> - You have to say that, of course.<eos> Lone has a small majority in the party and if you say you're running they'll smell a rat and elect Lone at once Aksel or no Aksel.<eos> I think we'll stop here.<eos> I really sympathise with the young reporters who come here.<eos> They parade in here with hard-ons and front page dreams.

Okay, thanks.<eos> Mom?<eos> Bye, honey.<eos> Eraser.<eos> Look...<eos> Good morning... boys.<eos> Those of you aware that the bulletin board is to be read.<eos> Will have noticed certain changes here at school.<eos> You have new classmates.<eos> They live near the school, so most of you have probably seen many of them around.

Stop it, you're too drunk.<eos> - Don't be vulgar.<eos> - I'll show you vulgar.<eos> Let go. Don't touch me.<eos> The kids are asleep.<eos> - You'll wake them.<eos> - Vulgar?<eos> - I'm the vulgar one now.<eos> - Let me go. You know what? Your friends are the ones who are vulgar.<eos> Now they're vulgar.
You think you can gain their respect with you fists? Tell me.<eos> What will you do after you hit your classmate?<eos> Will you strangle him until he can't breathe?<eos> Until he's dead?<eos> And then what? Will you eat him?<eos> What's so funny?<eos> That's enough. - Your glass.<eos> - Not the kids, Patricio.<eos> They need to learn.<eos> Otherwise they lose control.
I'm Colonel Sotomayor, the new Principal of the school<eos> As you all know, strange things have been going on here at the school. Inappropriate things.<eos> We're here to fix that.<eos> To put everything in order.<eos> So that once and for all, you can devote yourselves to your studies and nothing else.<eos> As far as the students who don't pay, they should be advised that we don't want lazy people here,<eos> nor criminals of any kind.<eos> So we're gonna do a little house cleaning.<eos> As you can see, the priests are gone.<eos> And they should be forgotten.
Am I missing something?<eos> I paid the down payment on your house. I pay the mortgage. I introduced handsome to all of my contacts.<eos> He can't float the financing for a doghouse!<eos> But "we're fine".<eos> And you wonder why Chris is a junkie.<eos> I'll go.<eos> Chris?<eos> - God, it can't be.<eos> - Overbearing fathers-in-law!<eos> - They have a reputation to live up to.
- We never discussed my fee.<eos> - I don't have money.<eos> - I don't want your money.<eos> - What then?<eos> Just your time.<eos> I want to give you a seat at the table.<eos> - Along with that comes a commitment.<eos> - What sort of commitment?<eos> Harrison, like yourself, each of these men, at some point... have made regretful mistakes.<eos> And with a little help, they're trying to make up for them.
Can you make others see what you see? I can.<eos> The way I see it. The cop's got to go.<eos> Okay, honey, you ready?<eos> My mother called. She wants us to come over for dinner tonight.<eos> Can you make it early? I'm getting a group together for drinks tonight.<eos> I thought maybe we could stay in and watch a movie.<eos> It 's Tuesday night, honey.<eos> No exceptions.<eos> What is it about these Tuesday nights?<eos> Each of these guys, at some point, have made regretful mistakes... and with a little help, they're trying to make up for it.
Whatever I went through, I'm responsible for.<eos> Look, we've all been drinking and we're really tired.<eos> It's... No, he's right.<eos> I was married to a man who loved me and gave me the two most beautiful children.<eos> That I'm not allowed to set eyes on them is just proof of my weakness and my husband's strength.<eos> It's disgusting how much influence he had on the judge.<eos> It's who you know. Life is all networking.<eos> I brought it on myself because I was bored.<eos> I mean, not bored with my children.<eos> God, they were the light of my life.
- What are you talking about?<eos> - I know you.<eos> Your voice changes when you're getting laid.<eos> Spill the beans, wheezy.<eos> Who is he?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You look great.<eos> - I forgot about your groupies.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> They're newly intoxicated with the wonders of the universe.
I never have thought about it this way before, but after I heard his speech and how emotional he got, it really touched me.<eos> I just can't imagine just one day being at home and the next day being shipped off to a concentration camp and being tortured like that.<eos> It just makes no sense why people in the world let that happen.<eos> It made me realize, the next time I say the Pledge of Allegiance, I'm going to think of how glad I am that it's a free country and I had the right to do what I feel and say what I say and I just--<eos> being much more respectful to it.<eos> When I was finished, I was-- they embraced me and hugged me and kissed me.<eos> They couldn't-- and they never heard these, so some of them cried, even.<eos> Because they never heard stories like this here, and they were never in contact with people that experienced it.<eos> To me, they're my heroes, because they've been through everything.<eos> I'm going to take what they've told me and pass it down with my kids to their grandchildren and so on, and to my friends and my family, where they will always remember that this horrible thing happened, and hopefully they can prevent it from ever happening again.
- Keep going. - You coming?<eos> - Piss off!<eos> Piss off!<eos> Marc, don't make me...<eos> Don't make me either.<eos> Can't you manage without me?<eos> Just get in and shut up.<eos> Get in!<eos> Leave it, guys, my lads will see to it.<eos> No, it's okay, they can do it.
In Paris, I understood.<eos> I saw your father and mother.<eos> They're the real monsters.<eos> I was no Ionger the bumptious child staring you in the eye.<eos> Sorry I'm late, Mother.<eos> Ferdinand, marcel. Leave us.<eos> I was ostracized. Quarantined like a sick sailor.<eos> How you must have scared my brothers off me!<eos> for life, perhaps.<eos> They were only cabin boys.
And I'm very happy to have met you, Maki-san.<eos> That's why I don't want to get you involved.<eos> There's something I need to do.<eos> Once it's all over I'd like to see you again.<eos> Shirakawa-kun!<eos> Sawatari.<eos> This time, for sure let's go to the promised place.<eos> What's the meaning of this, Oka-chan?<eos> ! You're going to use kids to do this?<eos> They want to do it.
- They're not happy.<eos> No.<eos> - They're not happy?<eos> No, they are.<eos> I don't know. I just mean French men.<eos> They drive me nuts.<eos> What is it?<eos> What about them?<eos> Well, they're very nice.<eos> They're great, you know, to be around.
Cistercian.<eos> - Why did you do that?<eos> - Why?<eos> I'd been doing some reading.<eos> Thought it'd be cool. Have you ever spent any time with monks or nuns?<eos> - No.<eos> It's not really my style.<eos> - No?<eos> Well, I expected them to be all glowering and stern, but they weren't.<eos> They were quick to laugh, really easy to be around.

Because deep in the darkest forest in there, there is a special kind of tree. That has a very special fruit growing on it.<eos> I picked a fruit like that.<eos> It looks like a little heart. And when you hold it in your hand... it beats.<eos> So I took it to your school playground...<eos> So tomorrow when you go there, a tree will have grown.<eos> You can sit under that tree, in the shade and hide.<eos> Because when you sit in the shade of that tree then none of the big, nasty boys can see you.<eos> They can't touch you.<eos> When you sit in the shade of that tree, you're invisible.<eos> They can't see the tree either. Because it's invisible.
You're young, indeed.<eos> You know how to hold your drink.<eos> The soldiers are approaching.<eos> I've lost my dagger pouch.<eos> I'm sorry I was late.<eos> The 'Flying Daggers' are always moving.<eos> Where should we go?<eos> We just keep heading north.<eos> Just head north?<eos> They will come to us.
The general said:<eos> It's the only way to expose the 'Flying Daggers'.<eos> Jin, you should know, there are more soldiers ahead.<eos> What!<eos> The general sent them.<eos> They don't know you either.<eos> You must stop them.<eos> There is nothing I can do.<eos> The order given to these soldiers is 'Fight to kill'.<eos> If you don't kill them they will kill you.
And, uh, his name is Buddy.<eos> Does Buddy want a friend?<eos> Buddy had a friend. Um, he ate him. So...<eos> You mind if I, uh-uh... Sure.<eos> Yeah. You...<eos> Yeah.<eos> I want to, I want to ask you something.<eos> Okay.<eos> When you were 18, did you ever return your parents' phone calls?<eos> Uh, well, they never called.
You know, you and Sam should go on a cruise.<eos> We´ve gone to the Caribbean and the Aegean.<eos> I´ve tried everything.<eos> I just wish I couId convince Sam to adopt.<eos> There´s nothing wrong with adoption.<eos> The male ego.<eos> They all want sons, and then when they get them... we do all the work.<eos> Sam says that you and Addison are trying to have another one.<eos> Men think they know everything, don´t they?<eos> They don´t know what it´s like to be pregnant.
Jin-seok!<eos> What happened?<eos> I was forced to join the North Korean army or be killed.<eos> It's okay now, don't cry.<eos> Drink this.<eos> Should I report?<eos> Jin-tae!<eos> Report that all the enemies were killed in battle.<eos> - What are you saying?<eos> - They're excess baggage.
But not as the man in the picture.<eos> It's almost like he didn't want to be noticed.<eos> Which worked.<eos> Here we are, and we know nothing about him.<eos> As suspected, the victim's internal organs have been completely removed.<eos> No stomach, no intestines.<eos> - Presumably the cause of death.<eos> - It would seem so.<eos> Anything to indicate how it was done?<eos> They seem to have been removed through this circular incision made in his side measuring 11/4 inches.
Yeah, I know... for sword practice.<eos> Look at that pale path of light...<eos> That's the road to Valhalla...<eos> I wish I could see them sitting up there, all the great heroes... at table with the Gods.<eos> And they are watching over us mortals.<eos> - But why do they care about us?<eos> They need us just as much as we need them.<eos> We'll fight on their side, when the evil powers attack us.<eos> How do we know what they want us to do?<eos> - They map out our destinies.

I haven't eaten in seven days.<eos> -Seven days?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Any scraps I get, I give to the kids.<eos> -What kids?<eos> -My kids.<eos> I got four:<eos> Annie, Billy, Tommy, and Chuck.<eos> And all I wanted to do was give them a real Christmas this year.<eos> They deserve it.
Everything is illegal.<eos> There's a whole separate society within itself... I mean, you just walk down that one lane and it's another world.<eos> I knew I couldn't do this as a visitor.<eos> I wanted to stay with them, live with them and understand their lives.<eos> And of course, as soon as I entered the brothels... I met the children.<eos> The brothels are filled with children, they are everywhere.<eos> And they were so curious.<eos> They didn't understand why this woman had come and what I was doing there.<eos> They were all over me, and I would play with them.<eos> And take their photographs and they would take mine.
The one exception was a series of autobiographical essays Grant wrote in 1963.<eos> You know where I grew up?<eos> In a one-room shack with a dirt floor.<eos> You talk about this side of your family and that side.<eos> As far as I know, we only had one side, and it was awful poor.<eos> "I was born in Bristol, England in 1904.<eos> My family name is Leach, to which was added Archibald Alexander with no opportunity for me to protest."<eos> It hadn't been a very happy childhood.<eos> His parents were not happily married.<eos> "They were named Elias and Elsie Leach.
That girl's a curse.<eos> She's been bringing him bad luck for five years now.<eos> What's the kid's name?<eos> I can't remember...<eos> Jay... Jay?<eos> Jay, it is.<eos> Where is Jay?<eos> Jay is in Vancouver with Lee's parents...<eos> What the hell are they doing in Vancouver?<eos> That's where they're from, Lee's dad, they just moved back.
So did I.<eos> - I didn't think much of them.<eos> - No.<eos> They give a false image of him. As if there was nothing but drugs in his life. And misfortune...<eos> - It's not true at all.<eos> - No...<eos> It's journalists, they have this romantic idea of self-destruction.<eos> Lee wasn't self-destructive.<eos> Well... he did everything to excess.<eos> Less than the friends he hung around with back then... they're all complete alcoholics.
- I'm sorry.<eos> It's me I'm feeling tense...<eos> Let me get it.<eos> - How are you doing with Jay?<eos> - Fine, fine.<eos> It's the first time you've spent any time with him.<eos> Even with Lee, I didn't take much interest until he was... until he was already a little grownup.<eos> Kids intimidate me.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because they understand everything. they read your thoughts they know what you're going to say even before you say it.
Basically the guys walked off, away from our whole camp, in the middle of the night, drunk as hell.<eos> And Peter, being this young, immature fucking stupid....<eos> Here comes a cop.<eos> ...hippie fucking dumbass that he's being, went with him, and they walked away from my scene completely.<eos> And we've been up the alleyways back and forth.<eos> Here comes the sun.<eos> It's the next day.<eos> We've been looking forever.<eos> And they're not here.<eos> I'm sober, and I drank a lot more than they did, and I'm sober now.
What did he do?<eos> He spent and put all that energy into the water.<eos> In the face of this youthful alienation Laird precociously turned to an older generation for inspiration and camaraderie.<eos> Laird Hamilton was around the legendary big-wave riders of the '60s who were moving into the '70s, his dad being one of them.<eos> During that time period, Pipeline Beach was the mecca of surfing and anybody who was anybody in surfing came and surfed Pipeline.<eos> So I got to see all the guys.<eos> His dad was making boards for Peter Cole, Warren Harlow Jose Angel, the pioneers of big-wave surfing.<eos> And Laird was just this little sponge soaking all this stuff up.<eos> I aspired to be like these pioneers of big-wave riding.<eos> They were going out on days when people were evacuating.
Be a nice boy.<eos> Promise me.<eos> Lightning will strike you down.<eos> Right mom?<eos> Make a woman cry, and lighting will strike you down.<eos> You were right.<eos> She's really pretty.<eos> I'm so envious.<eos> The books are too old.<eos> They have nothing to look at, so they just play.
Oh, I love Big Macs.<eos> This is probably the first time in a long time that I've seen a big Mac that looks like the picture that actually almost looks like the picture.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Big Macs never look this good.<eos> You got to come to Chinatown for the good big Macs.<eos> You've heard about all these people who are suing these fast-food companies.<eos> Yes, I've heard of them.<eos> I'd throw the lawsuit out if I was a judge.<eos> And like I was saying if these fast-food places can put their signs up if I can walk by them and just totally ignore them and say, "I'm not hungry.<eos> I don't need this," ...they can do it, too.
That's the difference.<eos> His work is so good because he enjoys it so much.<eos> It's not the same for me.<eos> I don't think my work is as great as people say it is.<eos> In short, photography is about a single point of a moment.<eos> It's like stopping time.<eos> As everything gets condensed in that forced instant.<eos> Photography has a kind of... a reality which is almost illusion.<eos> Shooting makes you aware of this.<eos> But if you keep creating these points, they form a line which reflects your life.
No, with a "v". "Live", like "alive".<eos> Smart ass.<eos> Hey, honey, what about the Santa hats?<eos> Santa hats - negative.<eos> You fucking me?<eos> Tried "El Phone Book"?<eos> It's June, genius!<eos> So, I offered to get Santa hats and tinsel - in June!<eos> The guys had a beach bar in Zandvoort and had an Australian Christmas party every summer.<eos> They'd travel the world in the winter and picked up the idea somewhere.
No idea why...<eos> Yeah, that fag.<eos> That backdoor tourist with wrong clothes and droopy cheeks.<eos> Gotta hang up, Curly...<eos> Thingy 3 is here.<eos> Hey, Redbeard, give Motor Mouse the Pluto key chain?<eos> He still has to give you the blue keys.<eos> - Well then tell him.<eos> Dubious types named Thingy Two through Five regularly showed up? ? On mopeds a half hour after Simon would get beeped?<eos> They always got some key or another?
Well?<eos> Getting smart with me, eh?<eos> You'll decide this alone or do you want your sidekicks?<eos> Tired already?<eos> There is more to come.<eos> Get up.<eos> He was the one who started the light.<eos> Come on.<eos> "An animal is lost in the lorests... "<eos> "It knows not... "
Does anyone know where we're going?<eos> Hazel does, I'm sure.<eos> I've never seen anything like that before.<eos> The man-thing killed it.<eos> A man-thing?<eos> A hrududu.<eos> It runs on it.<eos> - The what?<eos> - The hrududu.<eos> - It runs on it?
Do you remember Darby used coke fires to melt his iron?<eos> Coke's clean, so the coke's fumes don't dirty the melting iron in the furnace, so it comes out pure, and strong enough to make cheap cylinders for Newcomen's engine.<eos> Well, you can guess where we go next - or, for a minute or two anyway;<eos> the steam engine.<eos> But to get there took two coincidences.<eos> The first one happened when the Newcomen engine had been working happily all over the place, for about 50 years.<eos> In 1763, there was a model of the Newcomen engine like this one in Glasgow University, and it broke down;<eos> so they asked the University repairman to fix it.<eos> And while he was fixing it, he realized that the Newcomen engine was really not as efficient as it could have been, for this reason.<eos> As the jet of water came into the main cylinder to condense the steam, it also cooled the cylinder down, so that the next time the steam came into the cylinder, it began to condense a little bit early,
I love it.<eos> Now back away slowly.<eos> Don't be stingy with that hair spray.<eos> You ain't got to pay it forward.<eos> Go until it clicks.<eos> I thought I kicked you out.<eos> Antwan let me back in.<eos> Damn it, Antwan.<eos> You and your big-ass heart.<eos> It wants what it wants.
Made for the hungry wolf!<eos> The titanic omelette!<eos> Eight dozen eggs!<eos> The whole school of fish, that teaches you what is like to eat well!<eos> The ox, look at him he will melt in your mouth!<eos> This cow might not be as tasty but is much more delicate!<eos> The veal, because to separate the family that would not be right.<eos> A whole thing of caviar, large kind and there is more.<eos> Here is a piece of toast to go with it.<eos> The camel, this you will like, and it has a good stuffing too.
Like a bird.<eos> - How are you enjoying yourself?<eos> - Nice.<eos> I've been reading up quite a bit about flying, you know... in an aerodynamics booklet.<eos> I don't know the first thing about it.<eos> Well, you know, the great pressure of going 90 miles per... forces the wind until it...<eos> Hey!<eos> Oh, excuse me.<eos> The lemon is for air sickness, sir.<eos> - What does it do?
But that is not all.<eos> Your right to own serfs will be revoked as soon as you move beyond Irkutsk.<eos> So your servants will not go with you.<eos> All right, they won't.<eos> I suspect, Princess, that you... You have no idea of what your life at the mines is going to be like.<eos> You will live there like the poorest peasant.<eos> Really?<eos> The huts are dirty, stinking, full of insects.<eos> Your food will be bread and kvass.<eos> I hate to mention the climate: it's horrible, it'll be pernicious for you.

- Keep back!<eos> Doctor!<eos> Doctor, come on!<eos> It's no good. He took the full force of the blast.<eos> They're bound to come back soon.<eos> We're trapped!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> There's a priest hole here somewhere.<eos> Marcus and I discovered it when we were boys.<eos> - It isn't very large, I'm afraid.
But the Command of Bombers also it had few aircraft for the mission that fit to it.<eos> Clearly that they had been come close more "Liberators" of America we could have improved the situation very before saved e the life of many sailors.<eos> Each time more the effort on war it depended on U.S.A.<eos> They produced ships merchant e ship-escort in mass to carry material e men for the invaded Europe.<eos> But the security of the route Atlantic it was vital.<eos> In January of 1943, The Roosevelts and the Churchills had decreed that priority had to be given principle to the defeat of the U-boats.<eos> They had constructed ship-escort more sophisticated.<eos> Now it had sufficients to pass to the attack.<eos> But, in January of 43, Doenitz the command of the German Navy assumed.<eos> It excused the majority of the ships e transferred the crews for the submarines.
there's another one.<eos> This is stonehenge, and it's from here we go to africa.<eos> Well, here it is at last, the goal of our quest.<eos> After six months and three days, we've finally caught up<eos> With the legendary walking tree of dahomey--<eos> Quercus nicholas parsonsus-- Resting here for a moment on its long journey south.<eos> It's almost incredible, isn't it<eos> To think that this huge tree has walked over 2,000 miles Across this inhospitable terrain to stop here Maybe just to take in water<eos> It's almost unimaginable, I find<eos> The thought of this mighty tree strolling through nigeria; Perhaps swaggering a little As it crosses the border into zaire;
Fascist Radio claims... that Communists started the Reichstag fire.<eos> A monstrous provocation by the Nazi government.<eos> The meeting is over.<eos> They want to outlaw our party... to choke off the voice of the working class.<eos> As long as there are communists in Germany... the fight against Hitler will never end.<eos> ...fight for peace among all peoples for Hitler, comrades, Hitler is war!<eos> There is a valley in Spain called Jarama. It's a place that we all know too well.<eos> For 'tis there that we wasted our manhood. And most of our old age as well.<eos> This social peace, reestablished at great cost... had lasted but a few years when there appeared, in order to announce its end, those who were to enter... the history of crime under the name of "Situationists".<eos> When the proletariat discovers that its own exteriorized force... conspires in the permanent reinforcement of capitalist society, no longer just in the form of labor, but also in the form of the unions, of the parties or of the state power... that it had constituted in order to emancipate... itself, it discovers as well by concrete historical experience... that it is the class totally inimical... to all fixed exteriorization... and to all specialization of power.
I don't want to pretend my case was anything special. Not in the least.<eos> But when they accused me to my face... and I suddenly had to admit: "Yes, it's true."<eos> That was dreadful.<eos> My mother wasn't too hard on me.<eos> But my father, the village blacksmith, was strict and terrible.<eos> When he heard about it, he went for me with an iron bar from the fire. He wanted to kill me.<eos> I had a younger sister... who used to point at me and say, "Shame on you!"<eos> When the child was due, I went into a nearby barn... because I didn't dare show my face at home.<eos> Strangers found me half dead. They carried me into the house and put me to bed.<eos> On the third day... they took my child away... and when I asked later where it was... they said it was in good hands.
Hitler, in July of 1940, it comes back of France in triumph, one met in the height of its power.<eos> The rapidity and certainty of its victories they had frightened until its generals.<eos> The doubts had had reply, the opposition of them would be reduced.<eos> It was then that Hitler disclosed, that the Russians would be the following ones.<eos> In the book "Mein Kampf" Adolf Hitler wrote:<eos> When we speak in a new territory, we must think about Russia, the proper destination points with respect to there.<eos> Russia would have yielded an area inhabitable for the German people,<eos> Lebensraum.<eos> The common German, as the Russians and the population in general, they had been apanhados of surprise, for the pact of Hitler with Stalin, in August of 1939.<eos> It and to the others, seemed the change most reasonable it enters the rival greaters of the world.
North of Africa 1940 - 1943<eos> 10 of June of 1940<eos> Benito Mussolini declares war to France and Great-Britain.<eos> Combatants of the land and the sea e of air!<eos> Italian people, to the weapons!<eos> They show to the world your will... your courage... your value!<eos> As one old Roman consul,<eos> Mussolini yearned for for an African empire.<eos> Already it had massacreed the abissínios and overwhelmd the Lybians.<eos> Now it wanted more.
Captain. Lieutenant.<eos> - It's coming off tonight. - What is?<eos> - Uh, pick a card.<eos> Any card. - [Phone Ringing]<eos> Captain McNeil.<eos> [Valano] Captain, it's Hugh Jellicoe.<eos> Him and Macy have been cozy now for a couple of blocks.<eos> Pretty heavy talk.<eos> Just now Jellicoe hands Macy an envelope.<eos> - Is it thick enough for a down payment?
Master I am puzzled.<eos> That is the beginning of wisdom.<eos> I have seen you laugh and I have seen you cry.<eos> And you do not?<eos> We are taught discipline.<eos> The purpose of discipline is to live more fully not less.<eos> How shall I know if my sorrow is only the echo of self-pity?<eos> Or my laughter the preening of my own happiness?<eos> The bird sings in the forest.<eos> Does it seek to be admired for its song?
Come on!<eos> Follow!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> And then I lost consciousness.<eos> What was in the hole that they had dug?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Try and describe it to me.<eos> Well it was a sort of container, quite big. You could see through it.
Never?<eos> It is necessary to be caught there differently.<eos> Let us suppose that... all is a dream.<eos> Approximately, it is true.<eos> The life is a dream, whether one is deadened or waked up.<eos> The day, we control our dreams.<eos> The night, it is the dream who controls us.<eos> Think of that.<eos> When you dreams which the rat is there, you controls the dream... or dreams it controls you?<eos> It controls me.
The birds were flying about and twittering with delight.<eos> And flowers were looking up through the green grass and laughing.<eos> It was lovely seen.<eos> Only... In one corner... It was till Winter.<eos> It was in the farthest corner of the garden. And in it was standing a little boy.<eos> He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree.<eos> And he was wandering all round it and crying bitterly.<eos> Poor tree was still covered with frost and snow. And the North Wind was blowing and roaring above it.<eos> "Climb up, little boy", said the tree.<eos> And it bent its branches down as low as it could.
When a person at the moment of death grasps any object firmly, this sets up a cadaveric spasm, a muscular contraction which passes immediately into rigor mortis.<eos> The object remains firmly grasped until this rigidity finally passes off.<eos> In this case, the hand was still perfectly rigid, but it did not grasp the hair.<eos> Dr. Davidson...<eos> Dr. Davidson's assistant can testify to this, if you doubt my word.<eos> No, no. But, Dr. Thorndyke...<eos> Secondly, if I may, when a lock of hair is forcibly torn out, the roots will be found to be at the same end.<eos> Now, if you will examine the hair in the packet marked "A" with the aid of this lens... you will find the roots are at both ends.<eos> Therefore, it is not a lock of hair that has been forcibly torn out.<eos> Thirdly and most conclusively, when a hair is torn from the head, it drags out the root sheath.
Above all, impatient.<eos> I may tell you frankly the whole thing was an accident.<eos> An accident that might not have happened at all.<eos> And then some hearsay, and the records of the old woman.<eos> Everything started to fit together, my dear Rodion Romanovich.<eos> I happened to recall your article in that magazine, you remember?<eos> I made fun of you on your very first visit, but actually, as a great lover of literature, I like very much these first, young and fiery, essays.<eos> Smoke, fog. It's like a chord vibrating in the mist.<eos> Your article is absurd and fantastic, but obviously sincere.<eos> It's full of the pride of youth, and incorruptibility.
Good night ...<eos> Thank you very much ...<eos> Good night ...<eos> - Quiet, Lolly.<eos> Lolly, shut up!<eos> Daddy!<eos> Uncle Pete!<eos> - Dad!<eos> Here the animal, it wants to kill me!<eos> It will be back!
Tell Magobei that I want a one-on-one talk.<eos> Shino.<eos> My brother is waiting for you on the mountain.<eos> - Take the logs.<eos> - Logs?<eos> Light a fire.<eos> I can't hold my sword.<eos> My fingers are frozen.<eos> And the Sabai clan?<eos> What will it become?
And when I see your wife, I'll tell her what Abner gave me and then she'll know what a gem she's got. Her husband doesn't buy her an idiotic present like a table saw.<eos> Let's get out of that ridiculous outfit and let's get down to business. Now, let's see--<eos> Now, are you gonna take that off?<eos> -Larry, I can't. -Why not?<eos> Because of his allergy. He's allergic to bees.<eos> Yes, and I can't take the chance in case....<eos> In case one of his bees is loose.<eos> -That's right.<eos> -If you're that allergic why on earth did you pick this hobby?<eos> Well, you really don't pick a hobby, it sort of picks you.
He doesn't age.<eos> He... youthens?<eos> He can remember the future... so he can tell you what you'll do in it.<eos> Come here.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> Please.<eos> Now just turn, gently.<eos> Very slowly, open them.<eos> Do you see that castle?<eos> It used to light up in a sort of pink glow.
- He was beaten. - By whom?<eos> - I'll get some water. - By whom?<eos> A commando.<eos> Was it fascists?<eos> No, Communists.<eos> Now, right away, where?<eos> The meeting on the Cultural Revolution.<eos> The Sorbonne Marxist-Leninist group?<eos> I told you they were disgusting.<eos> An enemy attack is a good thing. It proves we've made a clear distinction to separate us. A film IN THE MAKING
Souvenirs from Korea.<eos> And our ticket to fame and fortune.<eos> I got a secret map that's going to lead us... straight to the sunken treasure of Captain Cortés.<eos> $60 million in Spanish gold, off the coast of Mexico.<eos> So, that's why that map's so frigging heavy.<eos> Welcome back to Kansas, buddy.<eos> The heart of America.<eos> The land of wheat, corn, bibles, and... natural gas.<eos> That map's not as heavy as yours, but it's the real thing.<eos> And it's gonna get us $10,000 by tonight.
So?<eos> Look, I won't waste any time.<eos> I saw you last night leaving the museum with that following you.<eos> I followed the van and I saw you set fire to the barn.<eos> I always suspected you discovered its secret but I had no idea you were trying to destroy it.<eos> Why?<eos> Why?<eos> Because power is a curse.<eos> Because you think you're in control and it becomes unmanageable.<eos> It's leading you and you become its victim.
-We have to save Jakoubek.<eos> -You can move my heart, but not my ship.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Boys!<eos> There's a chest in the sea and captain won't move, until the gold is hooked.<eos> What shall we do?<eos> I'll jump for it, I'm at home in the sea.<eos> My dear boys!<eos> That's it!<eos> It's not mine, mine was bigger, my was nailed and full of gold.
Then why would they put Benton through hours of relentless interrogation?<eos> Don't you see?<eos> They don't intend to let you testify.<eos> Who can stop me?<eos> Their men are outside right now.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> You can't afford not to believe it.<eos> - Let's go into your study.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because it faces Barodny Park, which is a perfect place for an assassin to operate from.
Oh, I don't know.<eos> The animal could've died of some kind of shock.<eos> - For once, I agree with you, doctor.<eos> - I said could have, Mr. Spock.<eos> We won't know until we get a full postmortem.<eos> No autopsy is necessary to know that the animal was terrified, confused.<eos> It was split into two halves and suddenly thrust back together again.<eos> Thus, shock, induced by blind terror.<eos> Yes, yes, that sounds likely.<eos> It couldn't understand.
- I want you to say it.<eos> I have a right to know something that relates me, I suppose.<eos> - No, it does not relate you, at all.<eos> What's between me and your picture is none of your business.<eos> I'm in love with your picture.<eos> - Yes but it is MY picture that you're in love with.<eos> So here I am.<eos> I'm here to listen to what you'll say.<eos> - You're not your picture.<eos> It belongs to my world.
Charlie mentioned that he was on some kind of roll, and he got a bonus from the movie, and then he went and blew it on some antique ring.<eos> Don't tell me that.<eos> What, for me?<eos> No.<eos> Of course for you.<eos> That's the kind of bling you like, right?<eos> Dead people's jewelry?<eos> Wait. What kind of ring did Bill get you, again?<eos> Oh, that's right -- None.<eos> It's on order, okay?
Not if a lie is more interesting.<eos> Born 1882.<eos> That makes me 43.<eos> You look 30.<eos> How old are you?<eos> 20.<eos> You look 30.<eos> We're the same generation.<eos> Ma'am, do you always talk with your body?<eos> It speaks several languages, fluently.
Mothra is coming.<eos> Let's go to the top of that hill.<eos> It's coming.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I knew you'd come.<eos> We always keep our promises.<eos> Let's go.<eos> What is that yellow powder?<eos> It's Mothra's final weapon.<eos> Isn't it like the powder of the poisonous moth?
Don't bother to send me a bill.<eos> You didn't have the car down there long enough to even look it over.<eos> What do you think about that?<eos> Was that the mechanic?<eos> They said they lost the car.<eos> The nerve of that guy.<eos> It's not lost, it's right here.<eos> Will you explain to me how it got here?<eos> They didn't deliver it.<eos> Well, it didn't drive itself home.
His pulse is coming back stronger than ever. It's unbelievable.<eos> Nothing is unbelievable if you have the nerve to experiment.<eos> I've been working on something like this for weeks.<eos> In your laboratory?<eos> I knew this would work, if only I had the opportunity...<eos> You don't conduct experiments on people.<eos> You should be sure of the results first.<eos> I am now.<eos> Stop massaging the heart.<eos> Let's see if it can take over by itself.
I wonder which of us is more awful.<eos> Nothing you can be is more terrible than what I am.<eos> A head without a body.<eos> A head that should be in its grave.<eos> I hate him.<eos> I hate him for what he's done to me.<eos> Can your horror match mine?<eos> Quiet, someone's coming.<eos> I have come to feed your friend.<eos> While you feed yourself with hate, it prefers food.
I trust you with my life.<eos> Well, I can't ask for anymore than that.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Oh, I was beginning to think you'd forgotten about me.<eos> Forgotten you?<eos> Oh, Doris, you've become very important to me. Very important.<eos> I put a little water in it, so it wouldn't be too strong for you.<eos> Fine, I'm not a very heavy drinker.<eos> Neither am I.<eos> Well, um, here's to your future. Whatever it may be.
And every time he comes home you throw yourself at him like when you was twelve years old<eos> I like to see him and I'm happy so I<eos> I'm not telling you what to do honey, but I'm all mixed up<eos> He looks so sad now and it hurts me.<eos> Katie, if it's going to hurt you that much you're gonna end up an old maid here<eos> No<eos> I tried to tell you a couple of times in the last year or so.<eos> I mean it.<eos> Katie<eos> It's wonderful for a whole family to love each other but you're a grown woman and you're in the same house with a grown man.
But we're together.<eos> We must always be together.<eos> But, Major, we hardly know each other's name.<eos> Mine is Leo, and we know each other's heart, Mademoiselle.<eos> Mademoiselle, we've always known one another.<eos> We've met a thousand times in our dreams, only to awake to the emptiness of life without one another.<eos> You are too rash, Major.<eos> Oh, indeed I am, Mademoiselle.<eos> I am. You see, my heart beats like a cavalry charge.<eos> It gallops towards its object - its sweet, sweet object - and then nothing in the world can hold it back.
Can I help you?<eos> Yes, we're from the Sheriff's Office.<eos> We had a call this evening.<eos> A missing persons report on some college kid named Nan Barlow.<eos> The party calling said that her last known whereabouts was the Raven's Inn.<eos> Nan Barlow, that's strange.<eos> Yes, I met her.<eos> When did you last see her?<eos> About two weeks ago.<eos> She came to my shop and borrowed this book, it's quite valuable and so not hearing from her,
This is my new housekeeper, Jane Patterson.<eos> You know, she worked for John Fleming.<eos> I know her. Where were you, Mrs. Patterson?<eos> In the kitchen cleaning up.<eos> I cooked the dinner tonight.<eos> Did you know that this secret closet was here?<eos> No, it was behind the grandfather's clock.<eos> Well, it was I who found it, really.<eos> I noticed the clock had been moved. And the door wasn't quite closed. I'll get it.<eos> Who is it?
- I knew it!<eos> This way!<eos> No, another one.<eos> I don't like this one.<eos> I assure you, this one is very ripe.<eos> - This one is better. - Give me another.<eos> - But this one is riper...<eos> My friends, I have an idea.<eos> Let us untie his donkey.<eos> It will undoubtedly lead us back to its home.
And of course it... It would be better for Susie.<eos> This ain't no time to make decisions. You're tired, and you don't know what you want.<eos> Maybe I don't want so much anymore.<eos> But what would you do if you gave it all up?<eos> Well, I could spend more time with Susie.<eos> And you could stay home with Sarah Jane.<eos> Do you know,<eos> I haven't been up to see my baby at school in weeks.<eos> Susie knows you love her.<eos> And you need show business as much as it needs you.
What's your name?<eos> You know me, Sir. You see me on Meetin' Street.<eos> Oh, of course - you're the goat man, I didn't reckognize you without your wagon.<eos> I'm the coroner, not a policeman.<eos> Now this dead one, Crown, you knew him by sight, didn't you?<eos> You'd know him if you saw him again?<eos> Seems like I remember him, when he used to come here around.<eos> Well, you're goin' to look at him again, right now.<eos> Nothing to be afraid of.<eos> All you've got to do is to view the body as a witness, and tell us who it is.
I mean, nobody up there can spell.<eos> If you give me your little black book, maybe I can get Zelda to comfort you.<eos> Sort of a private's privilege.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm PFC, you slob.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> Sir.<eos> The corpsman told me...<eos> How's your arm?<eos> Well, it went its way I went mine.
Giraudoux, in Porquerolles, wrote Suzanne et le Pacifique.<eos> Painters also idealized the Riviera.<eos> - In the paintings of Joseph Vernet...<eos> - Antibes.<eos> ... one could see the tower of the Château Grimaldi.<eos> In the château, Picasso's work is displayed.<eos> A painter and a ceramist, Picasso worked year-round.<eos> The only serious competition he finds to his painting and firing, the sun.<eos> The sun's carriage springs up from the water.<eos> It takes humanity along in its burning race, and leaves it lying in the evening, to be born again in the morning, and then starts again the cycle of a slow labor, which requires overcoming reserve and boredom,
¤ I have a great sorrow because I lost you.<eos> ¤ Rose of fire who I'll never forget,... ¤ beautiful scented rose, how lovely it was.<eos> ¤ One day I learned with great sorrow... ¤ that my beautiful flower had died of love.<eos> ¤ Filled with pain, I saw the rose... ¤ and with great regret and sadness, I said:... ¤ "Beautiful faded rose, rose of passion,... ¤ "poor, poor flower of my heart."<eos> ¤ In a Spanish village, you beautiful sunlit thing, I saw you,... ¤ and seeing your eyes devoid of light, I felt blind myself... ¤ and to your lips, formerly red, I tied a flower.<eos> ¤ Rose of fire who I'll never forget,... ¤ beautiful scented rose, how lovely you were. ¤<eos> ~ What do you think?<eos> ~ You sing very well.<eos> No, I was talking about the record-player.<eos> It taught me.
Thank you, sir.<eos> - Good morning, General.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> Hello there, soldier.<eos> Ready to kill more Germans?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Aha! Working over your rifle, I see.<eos> Well, that's the way.<eos> It's a soldier's best friend.<eos> You be good to it, and it'll always be good to you.
One of our men has been pinned beneath a supply wagon.<eos> Get more men. - See here. What's going on here?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> Thank you, stranger. You... You saved my life.<eos> Better had I saved your soul, brother... than your poor sinful body.<eos> Who is that man?<eos> He is Ferrovius.<eos> Ferrovius.<eos> Could that be the same Ferrovius... who made such wonderful conversions in the northern cities?<eos> I'd certainly like to meet him if it is.
But I don't love him!<eos> I never did.<eos> Please, you must believe me!<eos> You must!<eos> Dancing's excellent, but the comedy's poor.<eos> We'll have to get rid of that clown.<eos> I've called Blackmore's Agency, they're sending down another man.<eos> You know who that clown is?<eos> I don't care if it's Calvero himself. He isn't funny.<eos> - But that's who it is.
Then were you crying because you're afraid for yourself... - afraid of what people will say? - No.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Society has a strict set of rules about that sort of thing... the bylaws of our social corporation.<eos> You violated section "A," article one.<eos> That can bring heavy penalties, up to and including expulsion.<eos> You really think I'm a coward, don't you?<eos> - Are you?<eos> Which brings us to the party of the third part... the baby.<eos> Were you crying because of the baby?<eos> You can't say there won't be time enough for you to love your baby... and, if you're a good mother, to have it love you.
All the businesspeople of Rémonville, for months now we've been wondering what we could do to give, how shall I put it, a little push to our village.<eos> - - A little push?<eos> We're not very well situated, and it all comes from that.<eos> - - It comes from that? -<eos> - Suppose we were right on the Evreux road, business would go up right away, wouldn't it?<eos> Of course, ladies. But I don't have the power to move our village.<eos> Of course not!<eos> But without moving it, you could perhaps do it a great service.<eos> A great service?<eos> It would be enough to draw attention to it.
If I had the money, I could help you, couldn't I? Right.<eos> And if I could help you, I would, wouldn't I? Right.<eos> But if you ain't got socks, you can't pull 'em up, now, can you?<eos> Aw, now, Googin, you're a man of imagination.<eos> With all the best will in the world, I'm just helpless. Just plain, sprawling' helpless.<eos> But this is a golden opportunity.<eos> One chance in a thousand.<eos> Invest your money where it means something.<eos> I'm just plain, simple sorry, Harry... but if you want anything else... I can print you a passport, birth certificate, medical license.<eos> Just ask old Googin and it's yours.
No dog?<eos> It died three years ago<eos> But the sign keeps prowlers away<eos> What's wrong?<eos> A cold?<eos> No, tuberculosis<eos> I've had it five years<eos> I've gotten used to it I'm not even bored anymore<eos> I keep busy imagining things<eos> Even this tiny garden ... It has flowers, clouds overhead and birds...
That note you were going for.<eos> That thing you were trying for.<eos> There is no such thing, Rick.<eos> Not on the trumpet.<eos> He dropped out of sight after that, and word got around he was washed-up.<eos> The truth is, the only thing in the world he felt safe with was his trumpet.<eos> And when that let him down too, he just couldn't take it.<eos> He went to pieces, but not in any small way.<eos> Habit is a remarkable thing.<eos> It escapes no one.
For the town was growing and changing.<eos> It was heaving up in the middle, incredibly. It was spreading incredibly.<eos> And as it heaved and spread, it befouled itself, and darkened it's sky.<eos> This was the last walk home he was ever to take up National Avenue to Amberson Addition, and the big old house at the foot of Amberson Boulevard.<eos> Tomorrow, they were to move out.<eos> Tomorrow, everything would be gone.<eos> Something had happened. A thing which, years ago, had been the eagerest hope of many, many good citizens of the town.<eos> Now it came at last.<eos> George Amberson Minafer had got his come-uppance.<eos> He got it three times filled, and running over.
