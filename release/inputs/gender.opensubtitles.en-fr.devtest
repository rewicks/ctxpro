But you screwed his lawyer.<eos> What did you expect?<eos> Deal with it.<eos> I am just trying to do my job.<eos> You shouldn't have told him about the plea deal.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I'm obligated to tell him.<eos> You know that.<eos> He is unstable and broken and... and reckless.<eos> And it is your obligation not to give him stupid ideas like a plea deal, because he's going to take it.
By going around like you are.<eos> Like we are?<eos> Yeah, with...you know, without your mousse and your contacts in.<eos> This is who we are, dumb-dumb.<eos> Yes, I know, Amy.<eos> It's who you are, Kieren, and running away won't change that.<eos> I'm not running away.<eos> I'm going to start a new life.<eos> You've already been given a new life.<eos> And you can live it here.
Molly's a very smart woman.<eos> She's a viable threat to the Offspring.<eos> But she is its mother.<eos> There could be consequences if we eliminate her.<eos> We must ensure its continued growth.<eos> Even at the risk of being discovered?<eos> It's a risk we must manage.<eos> I'm dying, Alan.<eos> The substance that sustains me has nearly been exhausted.<eos> Despite my best efforts, I have failed to reproduce it.
- Okay. - I'm gonna do some combinations...<eos> - Mm-hmm. Kicks, punches, jabs...<eos> Some elbows.<eos> - You have to repeat it back to me perfectly.<eos> - Oh... - Can't miss a beat.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Now, if you do screw up... You got to drop and give me ten push-ups.<eos> That's what we're doing today.<eos> That's a totally one-sided deal that I would never accept.<eos> How about this? How about you show me a combination and if I repeat it perfectly, mm-hmm.
No, no, just family.<eos> I'm thinking of moving up there, you know, starting over.<eos> My Uncle's a foreman at a battery factory.<eos> He got me a job interview.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Citizen Walton.<eos> All right.<eos> Yeah, thanks to you, I got a second chance, you know.<eos> Doesn't happen every day.<eos> I ain't planning on wasting it, you know?
- Oh, come on.<eos> Wilky, take off your clothes.<eos> Do it.<eos> Asshole.<eos> Those, too.<eos> You satisfied?<eos> I can't believe you don't trust me after everything we've been through together.<eos> You forgot to take off your watch, Wilky.<eos> You gave me this watch.<eos> I know, and now I want it back.
Uh, come on, Milhouse, don't pretend you're asleep.<eos> This is the world we live in.<eos> Hey, Krusty, our local deli just named a sandwich after you.<eos> It's called "The Unfunny Comedian."<eos> You will always be remembered for your countless appearances on the Krusty the Clown Show and your one appearance on To Catch A Predator.<eos> Hey, I spent a lifetime making people happy.<eos> Yeah-- plastic surgeons and divorce lawyers.<eos> I was just about to say that.<eos> Oh, he took my laugh.<eos> Screw it, I'm doing it anyway.
I'm kidding.<eos> I don't give a shit.<eos> This is court, people, not Maury Povich.<eos> Defense, how do you plead?<eos> Your Honor, I need a short recess, 'cause I have to go resign.<eos> Five-minute recess. [Gavel pounds]<eos> Hey, what's the deal?<eos> I'm quitting.<eos> That's the deal.<eos> I'm gonna go home, open a nice bottle of wine, smash it on the counter, and shank myself with it.
Nina Whitley's having a bad day.<eos> Yeah, I got nothing.<eos> Bail is revoked.<eos> Make that a bad week.<eos> - What happened? - Rabies.<eos> Is that a thing or...<eos> - is it just for like, kids?<eos> - No, that's a thing.<eos> Maybe it's just her whole career.<eos> I'm gonna go home, open a nice bottle of wine, smash it on the counter, and shank myself with it.
You're gonna get a visit from Stephanie Horton.<eos> She's Anna Draper's niece.<eos> She's expecting and she's alone and she needs money and I should see her.<eos> Poor thing.<eos> I'll cancel my party and you can catch up.<eos> What party?<eos> You said you weren't coming this weekend, so I'm having the party for my acting class.<eos> - Tonight?<eos> - Tomorrow night.<eos> But I don't need to have it.
Wait, do you want to eat outside?<eos> I do that all the time.<eos> I love that you're wearing Anna's ring.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> I'm sorry I never met her.<eos> She's around.<eos> Believe me, you've met her.<eos> She's happy it's in the family.<eos> Well, maybe you'll have someone there to give it to.
We know who you are and we're only talking about a presentation right now.<eos> But we do have a problem working with the man who cut our throat in "The New York Times."<eos> Well, if you were to give us a shot, I'm prepared to leave the agency.<eos> Don, thanks for saying that so that we don't have to.<eos> Just know the man who wrote that letter was trying to save his business, not destroy yours.<eos> Like Lou, I have over 10 years of tobacco experience.<eos> Since my first day on Lucky Strike, the government was building a scaffold for your whole industry.<eos> And I found a way to stay that execution in '60, '62, '64, and '65.<eos> I'm also the only cigarette man who sat down with the opposition.<eos> They shared their strategy with me and I know how to beat it.
I'm going to wash my feet.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Did you park your white horse outside?<eos> Spare me the suspense and tell me what your "save the day" plan is.<eos> I don't have anything yet.<eos> The idea I had wasn't great.<eos> It wasn't great.<eos> It was terrible.<eos> I want to hear the real one.<eos> Or are you just going to pull it out during the presentation?
Sure you will, as long as my card keeps the tab open.<eos> Go order me another Sazerac.<eos> I'll be back in a second.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's a very bad habit.<eos> Well, you're carrying around a lighter, so I think...<eos> Then I realize my fly is open... has been for the last 46 minutes.<eos> Now, there's only four minutes left in the class.<eos> What do I do?<eos> Do I zip it up?
That kid's parents didn't do him any favors.<eos> Ma, that's not the point.<eos> It's a fantastic gift.<eos> Amazing.<eos> Why'd you spill all over it?<eos> I didn't!<eos> It hit the coffee cup, and that spilled, and then it rolled into...<eos> - So it's the ball's fault?<eos> - Please?<eos> Please, can you get it out? Please?
- What time did you leave?<eos> Around 1:00 AM.<eos> I had another date.<eos> We're gonna need a name.<eos> We can be discreet.<eos> Can you think of anything else?<eos> Did Joey behave strangely?<eos> Anything unusual?<eos> His car alarm kept going off.<eos> He'd silence it with his remote, but then it would go off again.
He's got crazy-long eyelashes, and you've got the cutest laugh.<eos> There.<eos> It's settled.<eos> Stolen, Mike-- my car was stolen.<eos> Why would somebody steal our crappy car?<eos> Probably for parts 'cause nobody would want that thing as a whole.<eos> I mean, I go outside, and gone.<eos> The car is gone.<eos> Yep, going to church every Sunday's really paying off.<eos> Axl: Hey, if I find it, can I have it?
Don't expect me to thank you for doing your job.<eos> I don't.<eos> You were the victim of a crime, Mr. Holden.<eos> And that crime's been investigated, and that investigation's led to the arrest of a suspect.<eos> Now...<eos> Oh, sorry about the chair.<eos> It's...<eos> Don't worry about the chair.<eos> That who you saw?<eos> May I hold it?
That's my lad.<eos> He's got nothing to do with you.<eos> You know me and your Becky had a thing going on.<eos> You twisted little bastard.<eos> You raped her.<eos> I didn't.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> That's not...<eos> I know what you did to her because she told me.<eos> You better not cross me, arsehole, because if you do, I'll chop your dick off and I'll make you swallow it.
What are you looking at?<eos> Go get the Dolly.<eos> This son of a bitch is gonna be heavy.<eos> I-I don't want to take this man's stuff.<eos> You feeling guilty?<eos> It's kind of a constant refrain with you, ain't it?<eos> You might ought to look into that.<eos> Look, this stove ain't been used since tater's wife died eight years ago.<eos> Stove ain't nothing more than a memory to him now, really.<eos> Might as well keep it up in his head where memories belong.
And now I'm lost.<eos> I know there's...<eos> There's good in you, Daniel.<eos> And that goodness is God.<eos> You don't know me, Tawney.<eos> You only think you know me.<eos> You only see what you want to see.<eos> You don't know the despicable things I've done.<eos> It doesn't change that it's there... your goodness.<eos> But if you keep that goodness to yourself and you don't share it with the world, that's a greater sin than anything you think you might have done in the past.
Have you had about me over the years?<eos> For me, for... for... For my benefit?<eos> I-I-I hope that can end one day.<eos> I hope that you can talk about something... else, like vacations or chihuahuas.<eos> I feel like grilling something.<eos> Can we do that?<eos> I don't see why not.<eos> Steak.<eos> A big, fat steak.<eos> I want to hear the fat hit the fire, smell it.
All we ask is that you pay what you can and only take what you need.<eos> Amen?<eos> "Take what you need" don't mean shoplift, Lloyd.<eos> Jesus, I got a bone to pick with you.<eos> Man, give me one of those plots, man, so I can turn my life around!<eos> Come on, man!<eos> - I want to work the land!<eos> - Look, Lloyd, there's a lot of stuff going on right now.<eos> I can't play with you, bro.<eos> But here... take this salad, enjoy it, and tell people about the community garden.
Wolf and crow, Ahmad.<eos> I am just a bookkeeper.<eos> I tally, I account, I serve.<eos> It was our day.<eos> Were we born of the same mother, we could not have worked together better as brothers.<eos> A piece of linen... is wrapped over the four small toes... pulled under the instep and behind the heel.<eos> Come.<eos> Now, this linen... is tightened daily until the toes break, fold under the foot and flatten themselves against the sole.<eos> The heel becomes slender over time.<eos> And finally... the heel shifts forward to the ball of the foot, breaking the arch and forcing it upward.
And you smiled at me.<eos> You know, that was the happiest moment of my life because for the first time ever, I felt like a man, that I could truly look after you, alone.<eos> Until I discovered...<eos> This.<eos> It turned me into a monster, obsessed with power, when all I really needed was you, your love.<eos> And now, through belle, there's love in my life again.<eos> And once more, I've started it with a lie.<eos> She thinks she has the real dagger.<eos> I only lied to her in order to avenge your death.<eos> And now that I've done so, I really need the strength to give it back, be that man I should be, the man you died for.
You know, after your arrest, I held on to this place for years.<eos> I used to come and stay here for hours and imagine myself here with you.<eos> I always was too sentimental.<eos> I've arranged for the tailor to come for a fitting later.<eos> TV crew comes at 4:00.<eos> Can't believe you set this up so quickly.<eos> Well, Margaux is a very close friend.<eos> You can't underestimate the hunger of the audience to know your story.<eos> David.<eos> Are you sure you want to tell it?
Don't put that on me.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Don't touch me!<eos> She told me it was time to play the quiet game, so I knew I wasn't supposed to ask any questions...<eos> - Would you like to see her?<eos> - No.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> ...or else, I might have told her... I forgot my doll.<eos> I loved that doll so much.<eos> It killed me to leave it behind.
Fake I.D.?<eos> Where are you getting this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe 'cause you've literally shown it to every student in school.<eos> I have been trying to ignore you all day.<eos> So, I got carried away.<eos> Come on, Coach Meller.<eos> You remember the rush of having a fake I.D., right?<eos> Ah, geez, all right.<eos> Just don't let me see it again.
_<eos> This girl is everything, yes?<eos> Looks like you're at about 12 weeks, give or take.<eos> If that's a traffic ticket, I can get you out of it.
No.<eos> He escaped.<eos> Did anybody get hurt?<eos> Not yet.<eos> I'm gonna have to come in there and take a look around.<eos> Fuck you, Kevin.<eos> I haven't talked to your father in a month.<eos> What?<eos> I could, uh, ignore the crazy.<eos> Even he could ignore it for a while, but he just wouldn't shut the fuck up.
He likes his chin being tickled.<eos> And his chest.<eos> You know how I knows he likes it?<eos> Cos that little leg goes up.<eos> He's sort of saying, "Thank you, that's my favouritest".<eos> Can't push it down.
God has put me on earth to save your soul.<eos> Pray for me.<eos> I'm sending you west, Campbell.<eos> Wyoming.<eos> I am capable of anything...<eos> I had me a vision that I was leaving this place.<eos> Once outside those gates, I cannot guarantee your safety.<eos> Now open up that gate.<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> I said open it up.
- when the shooter gets here.<eos> - What?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You have no idea what you just walked into.<eos> Good morning.<eos> I don't know what terrible things you've done in your life up to this point, but clearly your karma's out of balance to get assigned to my class.<eos> I'm Professor Annalise Keating, and this is criminal law 100.<eos> Or, as I prefer to call it...<eos> How to get away with murder.<eos> Sync and corrections by dreaMaker7 Brought to you by pizstol unlike many of my colleagues, I will not be teaching you how to study the law or theorize about it, but rather how to practice it...
Forensics found aspirin residue on the plate.<eos> She was warned about the allergy first day on the job, which means we should argue...<eos> We should argue...<eos> Which means we should argue...<eos> We should argue... means we should argue...<eos> She's guilty.<eos> I just moved in next door.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - Uh, your music...<eos> I normally wouldn't ask to turn it down but today was my first day of law school and I have...
- You got him to lie on the stand.<eos> - Is that why I picked you?<eos> Because I thought I picked you because your self-defense argument showed you think well on your feet.<eos> But now that you exposed what you really think of yourself and that you really don't believe you deserve this job...<eos> That's not what I said.<eos> That's exactly what you said, right before you accused me of illegal acts to win this case.<eos> We won because I did my job.<eos> You think carefully.<eos> Everything after this moment will not only determine your career but life.<eos> You can spend it in a corporate office drafting contracts and hitting on chubby paralegals before finally putting a gun in your mouth, or you can join my firm and become someone you actually like.
"and don't ever have sex in the backseat."<eos> Well, you followed the first one.<eos> It's just every time I sit in that car, I feel like she's still sitting next to me, yelling "Brake! Brake!<eos> Brake!"<eos> Gabi, the car is 30 years old.<eos> I think it's time to let her go.<eos> - What?<eos> ! Never!<eos> - It's not safe.<eos> If you keep driving it you're gonna see your mom a lot sooner than you think.
Guess what?<eos> Now you're dealing with this guy.<eos> So why don't you break it down to me, man to man?<eos> Okay, the timing belt snapped, sent the valves through the pistons, the transmission bands are shot, and the camshaft bearings are dust.<eos> That's what I-I figured.<eos> Yeah, I-I thought that was the problem.<eos> So how much is it gonna cost to fix?<eos> [Sighs] Look, man, can I be honest with you?<eos> That car is a coffin on wheels, okay?<eos> I would not let my mother drive it.

Look at me.<eos> You don't need to live in chaos.<eos> You don't even know what kind of fighter you are yet.<eos> All right?<eos> Come on, let's let these guys have the ring.<eos> Come on.<eos> You don't want that fucking view.<eos> Hey, you better win tonight.<eos> Better win that belt.<eos> So I can fucking take it from you.
Now, I could've let that go.<eos> I mean, it's just a dressing room sign, right?<eos> Everyone makes mistakes, right?<eos> I go to the owner.<eos> I say, "Hey, I don't mean to be a dick, but my name is Todd Barry with an "A".<eos> My dressing room sign says "Todd Berry" with an "E".<eos> And he gives me a look, like, "So?"<eos> And I go, "I know it's kind of a pain in the ass, "but I don't ask for much.<eos> "And yes, I know it's an easy mistake to make, "but it's also an easy mistake to fix, and it's very important to me."<eos> So I said, "All you gotta do "is take the sign down, "put it in a responsible place for refuse,

Two moments of real personal growth.<eos> Now, I know it might have been greedy, but I was gonna go for a third.<eos> Dre... this has gone too far.<eos> - You haven't worn clothes for two days.<eos> - Clothes are for suckers.<eos> I'm gonna go outside and get the paper.<eos> While you're out there, you might as well get the mail, too.<eos> Do you realize we've gotten less attention in the last week by trying to get attention?<eos> I can't even get mom to comb my hair.<eos> Well, if they're not gonna give us the talk, let's give it to each other.
Every great ad tells a story.<eos> Here to tell that story is Peggy Olson.<eos> Thank you, Don.<eos> That's a lot to live up to.<eos> Because I certainly can't tell a better story than the one we saw last night.<eos> I don't know what was more miraculous-- the technological achievement that put our species in a new perspective or the fact that all of us were doing the same thing at the same time.<eos> Sitting in this room, we can still feel the pleasure of that connection.<eos> Because, I realize now, we were starved for it.<eos> We really were.<eos> And, yes, we'll feel it again when they all return safely.
We're not waiting on Re-Kon?<eos> No. I got this.<eos> And turn my headphones on.<eos> Cut it.<eos> Damn.<eos> Wait. Why'd you stop?<eos> Something ain't right.<eos> It sounded beautiful.<eos> Where'd you find the song?<eos> My mama used to sing it to me.
So, basically, you've got nothing.<eos> Junior. Show a little respect.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> The boys are a little rough around the edges.<eos> But they loved their little sister.<eos> She was an angel.<eos> Yeah, and it got her killed and thrown in a ditch.<eos> Junior.<eos> Now, what about that video online?<eos> You're not looking into it as a possible lead?
The jury at your murder trial isn't gonna think so.<eos> They'll connect the dots the same way we did.<eos> No, there isn't gonna be a trial 'cause I didn't kill the guy.<eos> But you did threaten him, and the parts used to make the device that did kill him were all sent to a P.O. box in your name.<eos> I'm telling you, I don't know anything about that.<eos> But you do know something about engineering.<eos> I mean, you could have built that device with your eyes closed.<eos> I want my lawyer.<eos> He's got a story.<eos> He's just doing everything he can not to tell it.
But that's okay.<eos> I guess spies don't need sleep.<eos> I'll give you something on Humphries.<eos> That's what you really want.<eos> No, I'm fine with just locking you up.<eos> But if you want to have a conversation, tell me everything, and we'll see where we go from there.<eos> I needed a job to stay in the country.<eos> Humphries was the only one who made me an offer, which, of course, came with a catch.<eos> You would be working for Eternity labs, instead of him.<eos> He said they stole his idea, and we were going to get it back.
Yeah, put it down, yeah.<eos> All right, now kick it over here.<eos> Easy.<eos> Come on, kick it over here.<eos> All right. Now, get my briefcase.<eos> - Okay.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> - Quick!<eos> - Make sure it's locked. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> All right, now put it on the floor with handle up.
You and your poker games.<eos> You couldn't just get a real job, like a normal person?<eos> Oh, really?<eos> 'Cause I didn't hear you complaining when we were driving the sports car around and you got to flash your little ring.<eos> We're actually taking the car.<eos> And your ring, as well.<eos> Over my dead body.<eos> Okay, well, it's on the list.<eos> Okay, this ring is the only good thing that came out of this marriage.<eos> I'm keeping it.
Hey, I'm gonna need one of you for the interrogation.<eos> You stay.<eos> Take a break from the rookie.<eos> I got to get him to Fite Nite, anyway.<eos> I bet it's guns.<eos> Or drugs.<eos> It's always drugs with these Dowling guys.<eos> Gail: I bet it's a severed head.<eos> Why would there be a severed head in a safe, Gail?<eos> Where else would you keep it?
Wally?<eos> He's nowhere in this book.<eos> It's not a Where's Wally one.<eos> How would you know?<eos> Maybe you just haven't found him yet.<eos> He's not in every book.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, that's a few years of my life I'll be needing back.<eos> Are you scared?<eos> The thing on the bed, whatever it is... ..look at it.
Molly's a very smart woman.<eos> She's a viable threat to the Offspring.<eos> But she is its mother.<eos> There could be consequences if we eliminate her.<eos> We must ensure its continued growth.<eos> Even at the risk of being discovered?<eos> It's a risk we must manage.<eos> I'm dying, Alan.<eos> The substance that sustains me has nearly been exhausted.<eos> Despite my best efforts, I have failed to reproduce it.
I'm sorry.<eos> We just talked to half a dozen people who did business at Pawn Kings yesterday.<eos> We got nothing.<eos> Uh, Nick's bringing in Meghan Kelly, the last customer on record.<eos> She's got two priors in our system for possession of cocaine.<eos> Let me know what she has to say.<eos> Officer Diaz... is that short for "Diazepam"?<eos> Actually, I'm kind of like the opposite of valium.<eos> Dov: According to this receipt, you sold some DVDs yesterday at 5:17 P.M.<eos> Yes, I sold my stash of porn... hoping to buy it back later.
- Just shut up!<eos> - Turn around right now!<eos> - No, no, turn... Put that down!<eos> Put the sword down.<eos> - I did not...<eos> - Okay, listen. Put the sword down right now.<eos> - Ray:<eos> Okay, quiet. - Just put the sword down right now.<eos> - I didn't kill anybody, all right?<eos> - Just put it down!
- This it? - Yeah.<eos> I'm gonna give you this, but you have to put the sword down now.<eos> This is what you came here for, right?<eos> But I have to take you in.<eos> [Panting] Now, turn around.<eos> Put your hands behind your back.<eos> [Engine turns over] It was a 1918 Allan Cup hockey ring...<eos> Spencer's grandfather's.<eos> The poor dummy hawked it for 100 bucks.<eos> - Bill Power was selling it online for $10,000. - Wow.

Even if we hadn't done that, we're her older brothers, Henry.<eos> People at that barbecue, we don't know who they are, how old they are, what they're like when they've been drinking.<eos> Remember the trouble I got into at that age?<eos> That was when you were watching me.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> - Oh, hey, I'm sorry.<eos> - Hey, what's the score?<eos> Gotta get a picture of Ricky. [Chuckles]<eos> You're probably not gonna get much for that photo, not unless there's a bong in it.<eos> Oh, I was just gonna put it on Instagram for my friends back home.

Previously on "The Originals"...<eos> This town was my home.<eos> I want it back.
Let him go, Elijah.<eos> Thank you, Nik.<eos> At least someone knows the meaning of family.<eos> I told you before.<eos> Marcellus is family.<eos> Unh!<eos> I don't fault you for your suspicion, nor Davina for her contempt.<eos> That does not alter our present dilemma.<eos> She has that stake.<eos> I want it back.
- Can I look at it on the way to my mouth? - Nuh-uh-uh!<eos> - Yours is here. - Aww.<eos> The little, runty sad one from the leftover batter.<eos> Aww. I'm gonna put it out of its misery.<eos> God, I can't wait to see the look on Josh's face when I hand him my birthday present.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna say this one more time:<eos> Your gift is super girlfriendy.<eos> Oh please.<eos> His favorite childhood blanket was partially destroyed in a fire.<eos> All I did was hunt down the exact color of yarn on the Internet, and take crochet classes and spend three weeks recreating it.
Hey, you know what?<eos> I'd just be glad to know she'd do laundry.<eos> Of course she's gonna say something romantic, like... how, even in this gorgeous setting, all she sees is you, and how you make her excited to get up every morning, and when you're apart, she's always thinking in you and how to make you happy.<eos> Oh, my damn.<eos> Juju!<eos> I'm here!<eos> Sorry I'm late!<eos> What?<eos> You're hurting me.<eos> Josh is excited to marry the girl who made him that blanket, only Caroline's not the girl who made it.
Only cash exchange between him and I was like a ten spot, wasn't it?<eos> Yeah, wow is right.<eos> He's got balls on both sides of his head, look at him.<eos> What are you gonna do with all that weed?<eos> Mush.<eos> That is so much weed you got.<eos> You should sell it. Make a profit.<eos> Buy some shit.<eos> Buy what shit?<eos> I'm not gonna sell it, I'm gonna smoke it. And I'm gonna share it.
It's enough to bring him in.<eos> Right, where we headed?<eos> What's the address?<eos> But you got his name?<eos> Erm... erm... he used to be a choir boy, if that's any use?<eos> ~ It's no use at all.<eos> ~ No.<eos> ~ Feet!<eos> ~ I know! I've neglected my duties, my standards are slipping.<eos> ~ Can I just have a cup of tea and drink it in peace?
I'll go to see de Gaulle.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> - Goodbye.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> Tell my wife I'm going to the Spruces.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> - Let's talk about war.<eos> - No!<eos> I don't want to talk about that.<eos> Women don't talk about it and don't make it.
Who's in charge?<eos> You are.<eos> And who runs the place?<eos> You do.<eos> Sky, put it down.<eos> Put the shiv down.<eos> Thanks for dropping me in the shit with Ferguson.<eos> Well, you were a bit heavy-handed, Fletch.<eos> She was armed with a shiv.<eos> Yeah, well, she was going to drop it.
She has her suspicions, yeah.<eos> I guess we're both fucked then.<eos> Possibly.<eos> I owe you.<eos> I won't forget it.<eos> Hey, Simmo...<eos> There's something you could do for me.<eos> Can you please give this letter to Brayden?<eos> It's to say how sorry I am.<eos> You can read it.
His oldest, Will. We're close.<eos> Like a son to me.<eos> Assistant US Attorney in Manhattan.<eos> You walk close to the edge.<eos> - There's no law against inside information. -(CHUCKLES)<eos> Knock wood.<eos> Oh, I took the liberty of ordering for both of us.<eos> What on God's green earth?<eos> Veal parmigiana.<eos> Chef Vola takes an entire veal chop, slices it lengthwise, breaded, fried in olive oil, drowned in cheese and tomato sauce.
- A kit from Sears...<eos> The roof leaks for always.<eos> Oh, well, maybe Eli can help.<eos> He's very handy.<eos> This is true?<eos> You come during daytime maybe.<eos> When husband is not at home or working, making the pickups.<eos> Sounds like a two-man job to me.<eos> Maybe it's better if I...<eos> He fixes washing machine and then he breaks it.
Think the bullet's still in.<eos> He's lost a lot of blood, maybe two pints.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> Oh, uh... It's a car accident.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> Let's hear it.<eos> Let's hear it all.<eos> Did you shoot this man?<eos> No. Check the ballistics on his gun.<eos> Hey, I want it back after you've done with it.
Understand?<eos> I am thinking straight.<eos> That Irish rotter needs to be stopped.<eos> Go home, Gary.<eos> That's an order.<eos> Don't worry, Jem.<eos> This is the last time you have to see me.<eos> Jem, can you at least look at me?<eos> Open up!<eos> Open this bloody door or I'll bust it through!
Well, that's what they're charging me with, and like a million other things.<eos> McGregor.<eos> That's Irish, huh?<eos> My grandparents came over from Derry.<eos> Ah. Marie Flanagan.<eos> Uh, mine were from... somewhere like that.<eos> I don't -- I don't know.<eos> Uh, you mind if I take the top bunk?<eos> I get a little claustrophobic.<eos> Well, that depends -- are you crazy enough to take it from me?
Did you kill Nicole Raymond?<eos> Man, I never killed anybody.<eos> What?<eos> Well, what do you think?<eos> You believe him?<eos> Agents.<eos> It looks bad, but Zach didn't do this.<eos> He's probably gonna get the needle.<eos> Obviously, if there's anything you can do, it'd be appreciated.<eos> If he's telling the truth, then Raymond killed his wife and then dumped the car in a bad neighborhood just hoping somebody would steal it.
You got to be very clear about where your loyalties lie.<eos> Oh, I am sir, very clear.<eos> He stole your challenge coin?<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Her CIA challenge coin?<eos> That's messed up.<eos> - You know, you earn those things.<eos> - Yup.<eos> I got it from the Basra op.<eos> He claims that I misplaced it in the move.
Just Al.<eos> Why would Fatah choose you?<eos> Why would the most dangerous man alive choose a stranger from a DC Network affiliate?<eos> I'm a trusted freelancer, an expert of the region, and I'm fair.<eos> When are you going to air?<eos> Within 48 hours.<eos> I'm sitting on a Pulitzer.<eos> Mr. Logan, in the interest of national security and American lives, I would ask that you please hold off on airing this interview.<eos> Ms. Tucker, I've been candid.<eos> I've been forthcoming, but as a journalist, I have a responsibility to air it.
I said, "sir, I am truly sorry we disrespected your daughter."<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh!<eos> Good ol' Southern charm, huh?<eos> Oh, it ain't failed me yet.<eos> Hm.<eos> All right.<eos> Now what do you want, before I'm too drunk to say yes?<eos> The Fatah interview.<eos> I need you to kill it.
Let's get this son-of-a-bitch.<eos> The interview.<eos> It's time.<eos> Good evening.<eos> I'm Philip Franklin.<eos> Yesterday my dear friend and fellow reporter Thomas Logan died tragically and unexpectedly.<eos> Tom's contribution to this newsroom and to the craft of journalism was sublime.<eos> We dedicate this broadcast and final interview to his memory.<eos> How do you answer the person who asks, "why do you want to kill us just because we do not believe as you believe?"<eos> Death comes to us all, but I am here to prevent death, not to cause it.
- Caitlin. - So wait, she did have the affair?<eos> - No. - Confused.<eos> Listen.<eos> I had sex with Mike Jameson at the El Rey Hotel on April 12th.<eos> He pulled down the straps on my dress and started kissing my shoulders.<eos> The problem is, the El Rey didn't open until el May.<eos> So, you think she made it all up?<eos> Hmm. Now listen to this last call that came in after the story broke.<eos> I have evidence that you need to see.<eos> Bring it to the interview.
It never ends.<eos> Since that night nearly two centuries ago, every time I die, I always return in water, and I'm always naked.<eos> Lends itself to some slightly awkward situations.<eos> Now you know about as much about my condition as I do.<eos> All I know for certain is that the pain is real.<eos> It's just the dying part that's not.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> Just imagine all the things you could do with eternity.<eos> See the world, speak countless languages.<eos> In fact, there's almost nothing in this life I haven't done, except leave it.
"amor et separa vix deo conceditur" --<eos> "even god finds it hard to love and be wise at the same time."<eos> Beautiful, except for one tiny mistake.<eos> The killer used "amor" for love, Instead of the infinitive "amare."<eos> Professor browning would never have made that mistake.<eos> Okay. [ sighs ] you heard him.<eos> We got a crime scene here.<eos> I need video surveillance of everyone coming in and out Of this building in the last two hours.<eos> Man: Security footage is in here.<eos> This is the only monitor I can play it back on.
An m.E. With a sixth sense about death.<eos> Um...<eos> Yeah, well, you keep taking those off the board...<eos> He's all yours.<eos> ¶ for that one who got away vicky's parents are here to pick up her stuff.<eos> Assuming you want me to handle?<eos> No.<eos> It should come from me.<eos> Nothing can erase the pain of losing someone you love.<eos> You carry it with you for the rest of your life, However long that might be.
Someone, help!<eos> Stop him!<eos> Get him off me!<eos> Help!<eos> Call 911!<eos> There is a whole litany of things we can do to keep death at bay...<eos> Exercise, eat well, put on sunscreen.<eos> And though you might try to bargain with death, bear no delusions.<eos> It will find you.<eos> So if you spend all your time hiding from death, or, in my case, searching for it,
My question first.<eos> Uh, champagne?<eos> Never drink and you never lose your head.<eos> Now, why?<eos> I don't think I'm the right man for her.<eos> Nothing in life is certain, especially this.<eos> - It's a long story.<eos> - When you're in love, you feel like you have all the time in the world.<eos> But trust me, you don't.<eos> If you have a chance at love, Mr. Vermeer, take it.
Hey, my friend, in case you're not aware, there's a protocol, here.<eos> We don't usually increase the bids so drastically all at once.<eos> Oh, I am so sorry, amigo.<eos> I wasn't aware we're at the penny ante table.<eos> I'll slow down so you can catch your breath and count your chips.<eos> If you'd like to compare bank balances, I could have that arranged.<eos> But in the meantime, why don't you show a little class... if you have any.<eos> Are... Do you have a plan, or are you just trying to get attention here?<eos> Dad, I think it might be time for you to stand up for your son.<eos> If a fight breaks out, make sure you steer it toward the lasers protecting the statue.

_<eos> I've had this job since I first arrived in New York, six years trying to move up the ladder.<eos> Guess I fell off before I climbed very far.<eos> Will you call me after you meet with him?<eos> I don't want you to go through this alone.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Where's Amy?<eos> She just went into her apartment.<eos> Luc took the disk.<eos> He could be trying to plant it on her.
Neal and I are still working on other investigations.<eos> You won't admit the truth because then I would be right.<eos> No, it's not about being right.<eos> It's about bringing down the Panthers.<eos> Do you trust Caffrey?<eos> I do.<eos> That will be your undoing, not mine.<eos> I'm sending Keller back in.<eos> You'll destroy this operation.<eos> No, you will destroy it if you do not pull your C.I.
I never brought you a gift when you moved in.<eos> - Still don't see an orchid.<eos> - Flowers die.<eos> I thought I'd bring something better.<eos> Me...<eos> Across the table from you.<eos> - Where's your client?<eos> - He doesn't need to be here.<eos> This fight started with you and me.<eos> So let's you and me settle it right now.
Well, hold up.<eos> You're gonna do what now?<eos> Call my client?<eos> Louis.<eos> It may be your client, but it's still my case.<eos> Like hell it is, Jeff.<eos> - Okay. Okay, you call. - Oh, I plan to.<eos> And when I do, I'll be telling them that Mr. Slippery Fingers is no longer our problem.<eos> Just one second ago, you said you believed him.<eos> Yeah, I also told you that his story was so ridiculous and nobody would believe it.
Usually when someone wants to talk business--<eos> I want to take your offer.<eos> Mike, that offer's gone.<eos> And what if I told you I'd take less?<eos> I'd say I can't give you less.<eos> Come on, you're the guy who settles.<eos> I'm telling you I wanna settle.<eos> You're telling me you have to settle.<eos> And I know that you can get that offer back.<eos> It's not my job to get it back.
You're talking about using my expansion money.<eos> If you don't use it now, there's gonna be nothing to expand.<eos> You son of a bitch, you manipulated me.<eos> No, I told you a war was coming and that you needed a war chest.<eos> Well, now is the time to crack it open.<eos> You told me what I wanted to hear to get me on your side.<eos> You're the same as them.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> I looked you in the eye, and I told you that I wanted to save your company.<eos> They looked me in the eye and told me they wanted to rip it apart.
- You honor, I am sorry.<eos> I was just trying to protect her.<eos> - He thought you were someone else.<eos> We're so sorry. Sir, that will never happen again.<eos> - Tom called me about the charlie lewis case.<eos> - He tattled?<eos> - Judge wright, I am well aware<eos> Of your feelings about three strikes.<eos> You are not here to fix the law.<eos> You're here to uphold it.
I'll be brief.<eos> May I?<eos> Yeah, please do.<eos> I just wanted to tell you that I feel a bit guilty about how our conversation ended the other day at the courthouse.<eos> Oh, sir, um, please, that's... That's very nice of you, but, uh...<eos> Just wanted to say that judges... Really all people in positions of power... Have moments when they question how they got there.<eos> You may wonder if you rose through the ranks because you're an attractive woman, or you... May just think it was because you were just another minority hire.<eos> And I'm here in this establishment that I don't like much to tell you that it doesn't matter.<eos> Doesn't matter how you got the robe, Rebecca.<eos> It just matters what you do with it once you get there.
Neither of you are going anywhere.<eos> I've lost my crew.<eos> We were the last astronauts, this is the last shuttle, these are the last nuclear bombs.<eos> We're the last chance for Earth, and you're staying to help me.<eos> Decision made.<eos> What is killing the moon?<eos> How can the moon die, though?<eos> Everything does.<eos> Sooner or later.<eos> Can we save it?

After the message I sent mother tonight,<eos> I expect hellfire to rain down upon us imminently.<eos> We need to make a move before she strikes.<eos> Actually, moves were made while you were sleeping.<eos> It's good to see you vertical.<eos> Marcel and I each left a gift for you in the ballroom.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Kidnapping.<eos> It's a rather unpleasant way to begin a family reunion.<eos> Well, wait until you see how we end it.
Proud werewolves on a witch's leash.<eos> I hope those rings you're wearing are worth it.<eos> You're gonna like me, Davina Claire, and I'm gonna let you pretend a while that you don't already.<eos> When he wakes, he'll make his own decision.<eos> You declared war when you came after my family.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Slap them on a witch, can't do magic as long as they're on.<eos> Kidnapping.<eos> Rather unpleasant way to begin a family reunion.<eos> Well, wait until you see how we end it.
I... I'm sorry.<eos> I never should have trusted him.<eos> Kol doesn't have the stake.<eos> Klaus does.<eos> Matter of fact,<eos> Klaus has Kol, too.<eos> What?<eos> How is that possible?<eos> D, I'm the one who took him.<eos> I saw an opportunity, and I wasn't gonna pass it up, and trust me... we are all safer this way.
You go near Davina, and I'm gonna cut off parts of you that you'd rather keep.<eos> Ahh. More threats.<eos> How bloody inventive.<eos> Thing is, Klaus needs me, so that backs you into a bit of a corner, doesn't it?<eos> Well, until we get rid of your mom.<eos> I wonder what happens then.<eos> Well, Klaus might not need me when mother's gone, but you might.<eos> Come on, Marcel.<eos> You were king of the city once.<eos> You really think he's just gonna give it back to you?
To start over, To live a mortal life, Have a child of my own if i choose.<eos> Cursed as your first born If we're to believe the story.<eos> Not if i am no longer mikaelson blood.<eos> See, this is the beauty of mother, rebekah.<eos> Sometimes, even her darkest deeds Possess a logic that's difficult to refute.<eos> It's a lovely fantasy, elijah.<eos> Rebekah, you and i both know what mother is capable of.<eos> Now i do wonder if she would relent and leave us be.<eos> Now what if all that mother needs is a victory.<eos> Let her find it somewhere else.
- I'm ready for that.<eos> Uh, do they even know I exist?<eos> Yeah, of course they do.<eos> They know all about you.<eos> Hey. - Hey. - Can you put this in the back room?<eos> I don't feel like answering any questions about Kevin's wedding.<eos> Yeah, can I, uh, take a look?<eos> Sure.<eos> Jesus, that's some O'Hara shit.<eos> Yeah, I have to keep the tag on so I can return it afterwards.

Just when I thought my day couldn't get any worse.<eos> Hey, you.<eos> Hey. Um, this is my best friend.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Don't be creeped out, but I followed you here.<eos> I just...<eos> I really think we should talk about last night.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - It's for my mom.<eos> They're going to Mexico on their honeymoon, and she doesn't want to spend it on the toilet.
I said "half speed."<eos> "Half speed." How come you're not throwing your right hand?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> - Let me see it.<eos> - Pops.<eos> Let me see your fucking hand.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'm...<eos> Yeah, it's not fine.<eos> Go put it in ice.
We'll be good to go.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'm actually looking forward to it.<eos> I gotta be honest, when I heard someone from the governor's camp wanted to stop by and take a look, I was a little surprised.<eos> - Yeah, why's that?<eos> Well, I figured you guys would be wrapped up with this trial.<eos> If it was my kid who had been murdered, I'd be a wreck until I got the verdict.<eos> Well, that's why I'm here.<eos> The governor's gun bill is on the top of his agenda.<eos> That's why we need to make sure nobody derails it.

Mako, I'm so glad you're here.<eos> Of course Korra...<eos> Avatar.<eos> Avatar Korra.<eos> Right.<eos> The Avatar... thanks you for your loyal service.<eos> Did you find any more leads?<eos> There are reports of airbenders popping up all over the Earth Kingdom.<eos> I marked the villages on this map.<eos> You guys can take it with you.
After all these years?<eos> Boys, this is your grandmother, Yin.<eos> Oh, it is so wonderful to finally meet my long-lost grandchildren.<eos> Where is San and your mother?<eos> Wait, you mean, you don't know?<eos> I'm sorry. They were killed when we were little.<eos> I don't like the looks of this.<eos> Let's hurry up and get out of here.<eos> You here to pick up the tax shipment?<eos> Go ahead and load it on the airship.
That is the order of things.<eos> You want to know about Eagle's Teaching, ask Father, brother.<eos> If you know something... the burden is on you to defend him.<eos> And I will... with my life.<eos> And if something happens to our father... I will be the one to take it.<eos> What did Jingim want of you?<eos> Amends made before the White Moon.<eos> There are no answers here, Byamba, only pain.<eos> The most important answer may lie within.<eos> We must confirm it to understand our next steps.
- Well, he's a spy.<eos> There's a pretty good chance he's right.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Do you have anything to do with Annie leaving ODNI?<eos> Leaving?<eos> I thought she was with you and Calder.<eos> She left us standing in director Fitzgerald's office, and then out of the blue, Caitlyn Cook calls me and asks me about an Op Annie's working with Ryan McQuaid.<eos> We should talk.<eos> Auggie, I'm on my way to meet Roger in Brunswick.<eos> He's got the intel, but he wouldn't give it to me over the phone.
Gave me 10 reasons to sign with him.<eos> Flying me in on the label's jet to see your show was one of them.<eos> Hey. Hey. He's having a meet-and-greet onstage in the middle of my sound check?<eos> Sorry, Deac.<eos> He's the boss.<eos> And don't he love to let me know it.<eos> Didn't think it was possible, but you're even cuter when you're mad.<eos> I must be downright adorable right now.<eos> So, I hear you got yourself a new song.<eos> - You gonna play it tonight?
I googled you.<eos> You forgot to mention that you charted.<eos> I've listened to as much of your music as I possibly could find, a...<eos> and you're... you're amazing.<eos> You still have the gift that these articles are talking about.<eos> Yeah, well, it turned into a curse, didn't it?<eos> Contributor!<eos> No, what happened was tragic, but you can't believe that your family would want you to turn your back on music.<eos> Well, I wrote a song, didn't I?<eos> Yeah, and you should sing it, not just sell it to somebody else.

Come on.<eos> ♪ It' drivin' me insane ♪<eos> ♪ It's just a ball and chain ♪ Thank you!<eos> Yeah! Yeah!<eos> I'm gonna try to do it without this.<eos> Um, this song was written for me by a talented kid, uh, named Gunnar Scott, and I just knew...<eos> I knew it was gonna be a big hit, so I asked Rayna to sing it with me, and it blew up, and, uh, so did her album, as you can tell by how much tail she's kicking tonight.
Previously on Suits...<eos> You're good with me working on the takeover with Logan.<eos> As long as we don't let that affect this.<eos> We won't.<eos> I do always get what I want, and what I want to do with this company is strip it down, flip it over, and then--
Oh, shit.<eos> Harvey Specter.<eos> If you'd be more comfortable, I have a couple rocks you could crawl out from under.<eos> Most people would go with some tall weeds I could hide behind.<eos> Most people don't take these fights personally.<eos> I do.<eos> That's exactly why I'm here.<eos> Meaning?<eos> I came here to tell you something man-to-man, because I know what this company means to you.<eos> If you knew what this company meant to me, you wouldn't be trying to steal it.
- I have him!<eos> I have him!<eos> William Christopher Jackson.<eos> No priors. Hmm.<eos> He's just made an auspicious criminal debut.<eos> Okay, here it is.<eos> Uh, Chris Jackson drives a BMW 7 series, and it's equipped with a lojack system.<eos> Report the car as stolen and activate the lojack.<eos> And let's print out Jackson's DMV photo<eos> - and release it to our people.
What? !<eos> No, I don't want any ice cream!<eos> Okay, okay, you call me if you change your mind, sir.<eos> N-no.<eos> I'd like an orange snow cone.<eos> What?<eos> It's hot in here.<eos> Where's Julio going?<eos> I'm Detective Julio Sanchez, L.A.P.D.<eos> Would you take your jacket off and give it to me sir?
Would you take your jacket off and give it to me sir?<eos> - Please.<eos> - D-did I do something wrong?<eos> No.<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> By the power vested in me by the state, I declare you a temporary patrol officer of the L.A.P.D.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Okay, move over.<eos> Hold this.<eos> - Don't put it on!
You don't understand.<eos> They'd never let me. I...<eos> Then stay.<eos> You have a choice.<eos> What you have to do, whatever it is, will it really make you happy?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think you do.<eos> I think you know as well as I do that there'll be no peace in your heart like there is today.<eos> My heart has never known peace.<eos> Then maybe, just maybe, we'll find it together.
A story about surviving.<eos> Previously on Extant: I'm sorry, molly.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Of course.<eos> I-I just spoke to my wife.<eos> She said that you've sent someone to go with her t-t-to meet this thing.<eos> He's extremely capable.<eos> Tha-That's not the point.<eos> I come to you for help.<eos> I-I-I tell you about this... situation, the danger of this thing, and you sent my wife off t-to meet it?
I remember she fell in trying to grab a lily pad.<eos> You were so worried she'd get an infection.<eos> It's not fair, Alan, bringing me back here.<eos> I brought Mrs. Wimberley's truck.<eos> My car barely made it up the hill.<eos> Anya, after you see what I want to show you... if you still want to go, I promise I'll bring you back.<eos> You sure?<eos> Drones don't lie.<eos> This is Anya Sparks' car.<eos> Sparks must have figured out someone could find it.
- John, it's time to face the truth.<eos> Nine years old, and suffering for all eternity.<eos> The only one suffering here is you.<eos> - That's on me, mate.<eos> - There are no demons.<eos> So you keep telling me!<eos> Now make me believe.<eos> It's what I'm paying you for, isn't it?<eos> My goal today was to break my habit rituals.<eos> Like, I make a cup of tea and then I stir it nine times.

I need an ally more than an angle.<eos> And you're gonna need one, too, if you want to stay in this office.<eos> Tony Lucca from the FBI is on the line.<eos> I'll put him on speaker.<eos> Hey, Tony, what's the word on dropping the charges against Petrovna?<eos> Hey, Auggie.<eos> Hey. You get everything for your date with Ivan?<eos> Everything except Natasha's key.<eos> It's ready to go.<eos> I just need to pick it up from her.
No, I'm just not the kind of woman you're used to.<eos> Besides, I had an early plane, and I left a note.<eos> What can I do for you, miss Miller?<eos> You can start by not calling me Miss Miller.<eos> Ah, but in Paris, this is treating you like a lady.<eos> I just flew into De Gaulle an hour ago.<eos> We could discuss this in person.<eos> But maybe you're busy, and I can try you next time I'm in town.<eos> Are you tied up this afternoon?<eos> I have a meeting, but I could move it.
That shayna-maidel had to suffer through something so terrible?<eos> Give him what he wants.<eos> It's the only way to be done.<eos> Done, Raymond.<eos> Hey, Uncle Bunchy.<eos> Burgers.<eos> There you go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I thought you didn't like mustard.<eos> You want to try it the Boston way?
She brought him here.<eos> No, you won't live to see it.<eos> You're dying.<eos> And you're running out of whatever it is that's keeping you alive.<eos> Molly will bring me what I need.<eos> Ready to finish what we started?<eos> Walk.<eos> Toward the bathroom.<eos> If you make me do that, I can't promise he won't hurt you.<eos> Open it.

- Well, take some notes, kids, 'cause this is what pilates can do for you.<eos> Mr. Edson.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> [ Both laugh ]<eos> We all know the only reason you won't give us Rebecca Sutter's confession is that there's proof of coercion you don't want us to see.<eos> Oh, wouldn't that be so easy for you?<eos> Those dirty cops with their dirty interrogation techniques.<eos> Unfortunately for you, that's not what happened here.<eos> Then why not hand over the tape?<eos> We will if we decide to put it into evidence.
Oliver:<eos> It's not that complicated, really.<eos> You just download this app from the deep web and worm your way into the phone company's mainframe using basic java code.<eos> - Anyone could learn how to do it.<eos> - I changed my mind.<eos> I-I just... I don't care.<eos> Hey. Don't be a bitch.<eos> I could get arrested for this.<eos> I would never let that happen. [ Chuckles ]<eos> Says the first-year law student, who seems to spend more time breaking the law than practicing it.
No.<eos> Right.<eos> Because your son, Ryan, was holding your husband's service revolver in his hand.<eos> He pointed it at your unarmed husband's back, and he fired a shot that killed him.<eos> Isn't that what happened?<eos> Yes, but he...<eos> No further questions.<eos> My engagement ring is gone!<eos> Michaela, it's gonna be light soon.<eos> We still need to get rid of the bags and... [crying] I'm not leaving until we find it.
I'll trade you all my notes.<eos> And I'll give you copies of all of kan's old outlines.<eos> I have every criminal-law hornbook ever written.<eos> I think three people's enough for this study group.<eos> my God.<eos> This is so good.<eos> You like the photo?<eos> I snuck it while you were in the shower this morning.<eos> Wes was sitting right next to me.<eos> He could've seen it.
Fine.<eos> Then the police. But we can't just sit here and do nothing.<eos> No.<eos> Think. No one knows we were here.<eos> Annalise could be home any minute.<eos> Which is why we should leave.<eos> You want to run?<eos> I'm just saying... he fell after drinking too much.<eos> My car is outside.<eos> Anyone could've seen it.
Convert to what? Judaism.<eos> I read in an article, Lord Sinderby is a leading figure in the Jewish community.<eos> There's always something, isn't there?<eos> What do you mean, gone?<eos> She's gone.<eos> She didn't say where, but I doubt it's to Lady Rosamund's. Why?<eos> Of course she was very upset about Gregson, but why run off?<eos> I think I'll slip away, Carson.<eos> ls the car still outside?<eos> They're just unloading it now, My Lady.
These are Miss Lane Fox's.<eos> If you could take them in.<eos> Home, please.<eos> Can you first stop at Yew Tree Farm?<eos> Yes, Milady.<eos> Lady Edith has taken off.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> She's gone.<eos> She left her car at the station.<eos> Mr Branson's walking down there now to pick it up.
She doesn't mean it.<eos> On the contrary.<eos> It's the most honest thing she's ever said to me.<eos> There you are.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is our life overcomplicated?<eos> In what way?<eos> Mrs Patmore is buying a house up here.<eos> Why don't we sell the London house and do the same?<eos> We could rent it out as long as we want to work out Downton.
So, should I take her?<eos> I'll leave it to your mother. Well...<eos> I believe we should offer little Marigold a home here.<eos> Do you really, darling?<eos> Well, then, I suppose that's settled.<eos> Have all the guests arrived?<eos> I think so.<eos> I should tell Mrs Patmore it won't be long now.<eos> What are these?<eos> Mr Carson's got a notion he and I might buy a place as an investment and maybe run it as a guesthouse or rent it out.
That's a good story.<eos> Okay, I guess I was right about the big mouth part, at any rate.<eos> Do they work?<eos> If you know what you're doing.<eos> I've, um...<eos> I've never packed a barrel like this one before.<eos> Show me.<eos> This chamber takes about 50 grains of black powder.<eos> Set the ball on the lubricated patch.<eos> Uh-huh. And then press it into the barrel with your starter.
Hello...<eos> I want to say that I am luckier...<eos> I'm luckier than all of you.<eos> My husband never beats me or treats me badly.<eos> The truth is, he loves me.<eos> He loves me very much.<eos> But this doesn't seem to matter at all anymore.<eos> Today... I want to share with you that I am absolutely unhappy.<eos> I've lived a ridiculous life.<eos> I don't know what to do to change it.
We sent some people to the church.<eos> There's a working generator there, gassed up.<eos> The one here is half-full, but, with the way we're riding it, I don't know if it will last the night.<eos> Also, we don't have much food or water.<eos> If we're stuck here with no provisions, things will go south fast.<eos> Well, there's still a decent amount at the Sweetbriar.<eos> Don't know how secure it is, though.<eos> If it gets as cold as you think it's going to...<eos> We could lose it all to a freeze.<eos> I'll find Barbie, take the ambulance, fill it up with food.
Kidney, maybe, or her liver.<eos> Sam, I know you can help.<eos> Do something, all right?<eos> She's gonna need surgery to stop the bleeding.<eos> - Well, then, operate.<eos> Do whatever... - I'm not a surgeon!<eos> And we don't have anesthesia or equipment.<eos> I can't even tell which organ is injured without an MRI.<eos> - Listen, there is an answer...<eos> - Find it!
Did you ever suspect this?<eos> Maybe before you were even married?<eos> I used to work in this retail store.<eos> Clothes, jewelry, that kind of thing.<eos> There was a storage room in the back.<eos> Real small.<eos> Frank would wait for me there while I closed up.<eos> This one time I went in the back, and he, um-- he was...rubbing up against this mannequin.<eos> Its leg was gone.<eos> I freaked out, but he said he was just trying to fix it.
Invasion.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> As am I.<eos> Been running ever since, escaping Espheni prisons -- three of them.<eos> Richmond, Greensboro, Charlotte.<eos> Impressive.<eos> Hornets found me crossing into South Carolina, brought me here.<eos> Tell me about the escapes.<eos> Every camp is different, but one thing is a constant -- the green barrier.<eos> To go over it, you need one of these.
Talk about wasted money.<eos> What about the late fees on our credit card because somebody didn't pay the bill on time?<eos> Well, maybe I would have paid it if I wasn't also doing everything else around here.<eos> Oh, you're saying I don't do anything around here.<eos> Look at my chore chart.<eos> She made him a chore chart.<eos> I see it.<eos> "Do the dishes." There's a star right there.<eos> That was a pity star.<eos> Putting water in the roasting pan and leaving it in the sink is not doing the dishes.
Oh, hey, we ran into your mom at Benihana last night.<eos> Uh, yeah, she loves that place.<eos> Every time they flip a shrimp in the air, she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it.
Hey, Leonard.<eos> Guess who's back!<eos> Dr. Lorvis!<eos> Yeah. You care to join us?<eos> What? !<eos> You locked them in your basement?<eos> !<eos> Well, they're, they're not locked in.<eos> The door just sticks.<eos> Okay, so how do they unstick it?
Do you know someone?<eos> No, but if things don't work out with me and Leonard,<eos> I'll give you a call.<eos> Wait.<eos> How much do you talk about Star Trek?<eos> Okay, let's get this Victorian party started.<eos> I've done some research about some traditional parlor games we can play.<eos> Like what?<eos> Well, there's a fun one called Ball of Wool.<eos> You take a ball of wool, and you put it right in the center of the table.
We're gonna dig around the clock.<eos> I promise.<eos> Even if we do, it's gonna take us weeks.<eos> I have a possible solution.<eos> There is...<eos> a concealed Volm supply cache several miles from here.<eos> What are you talking about, Volm supply cache?<eos> We studied your pioneer and native American wars closely.<eos> Hidden supply stockpiles proved to be a vital resource for both sides.<eos> This cache should contain tools with advanced technology that could be used to break up this earth and clear it away more quickly.
Look, when I first came out of the cocoon, I was so confused.<eos> I thought I was helping Lourdes, freeing her from the pain she'd suffer when the attack came.<eos> This isn't just about her.<eos> Look around you.<eos> We were devastated by that attack!<eos> Those of us who survived hold you responsible.<eos> I am, so, please, please, let me make it up to you.<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> What Mason doesn't have the guts to do himself.<eos> You're gonna put that rifle down, or I'm gonna take it from you.
We have no way of knowing if the power core is guarded or not.<eos> If my father receives these messages, and if he chooses to respond, he could run interference.<eos> What do you mean, if he chooses to respond?<eos> Why wouldn't he choose to respond?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Is there something you're not telling me?<eos> My father and I did not part well, Tom Mason.<eos> He insisted that I leave with him, that Earth was a lost cause.<eos> I-I refused.<eos> I told him I would find the power core and I would destroy it on my own.
Don't call those monsters family.<eos> I wanted peace so badly that I believed their lies.<eos> And I believed yours!<eos> I searched for you, Lexi.<eos> When I lost you, I would've gone to the ends of the earth to find you, to find a way for us to be together -- a family.<eos> But you -- you betrayed all of that!<eos> Now I know that's never gonna happen -- not now, not after what you did.<eos> I know how badly I violated your trust.<eos> So please, please, let me make it up to you.<eos> I'm your best chance if you want to make it to the power core and destroy it.
But you -- you betrayed all of that!<eos> Now I know that's never gonna happen -- not now, not after what you did.<eos> I know how badly I violated your trust.<eos> So please, please, let me make it up to you.<eos> I'm your best chance if you want to make it to the power core and destroy it.<eos> How do you know about that?<eos> When I was with the Espheni, I-I learned how to control my abilities.<eos> I - - I -- it's hard to explain.<eos> You better try.<eos> It's like I can see energy, manipulate it, all of it -- gravity, radio waves, electrical charges.
What is that?<eos> Protein.<eos> Amino acids.<eos> Honestly, it would take too long to explain.<eos> Hold still.<eos> No, wait, wait.<eos> How am I gonna breathe?<eos> The substance I'm secreting is oxygen-rich.<eos> It'll enter your lungs and nourish you.<eos> But you have to let it in.
Where?<eos> The parking garage.<eos> I need a location.<eos> 2B.<eos> Dieter?<eos> Dieter?<eos> _<eos> Frank.<eos> My car's in the loading dock.<eos> I need you to bring it down to 2B.
- 'cause I really want to explain myself. - Gail...<eos> I'm seeing someone.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That's fine.<eos> Izzy!<eos> We made a list of all the discrepancies, so you can see that in no way did Officer McNally mislead anyone.<eos> Thank you, Staff Sergeant.<eos> As you know, my client's already given his written statement about the matter of his dismissal. - Brandon?<eos> - Yes, the same one we filed with your offices three weeks ago.<eos> Read it.
If we fall short with the combined brain power of all the Allies and a floating line of credit from the United States government, isn't there a chance that Werner Heisenberg will fall short, too?<eos> Of course.<eos> And if we fail, and Heisenberg fails, it'll never get built.<eos> We could all go home.<eos> You could have kept quiet.<eos> But instead, you walked into my office, and you sounded the alarm.<eos> I thought you should know.<eos> And now I do.<eos> And now we'll reorganize all of our resources toward finding a solution.<eos> And when we do drop the bomb, and make no mistake, we will drop it, all those lives will be on your head, Charlie.
- Let's go.<eos> - Welcome to the ccpd.<eos> - So this is your day job.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - I'm gonna rip out your hearts And eat 'em for lunch.<eos> - Delightful.<eos> - Lab rat, I need prints off this gun pronto.<eos> - Allen! Where the hell is the fiber analysis on the orloff case?<eos> - Upstairs.<eos> It's all finished.<eos> I can just run up and bring it down.
- Cut me open.<eos> The poison's still in me.<eos> - He brought us a sample. Caitlin, we need to do a pulmonary biopsy, Extract an active portion of that gas.<eos> - I can't give you any anesthetic.<eos> Your metabolism will burn right through it.<eos> - I heal quick, remember?<eos> - Do it.<eos> - Cisco, give me the syringe.<eos> This is gonna hurt a lot.<eos> - It's a small needle. You probably won't even feel it.

Rob would've wanted it.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> MI6 doesn't even know I'm here.<eos> They couldn't have their fingerprints on this, so you came to me... so I could do their dirty work.<eos> - When did you know?<eos> - When I saw Dekma.<eos> He couldn't have known where to find the weapon unless you called him.<eos> He's our dog in this fight.<eos> I was supposed to make sure he got the weapon.<eos> I'm gonna destroy it.
Keep trying.<eos> Maggie:<eos> They wouldn't go dark without telling us.<eos> Contact local pd. Get somebody out there fast.<eos> (computer dinging) Sir, county sheriff is already responding.<eos> There's reports of shots fired at that location.<eos> Send tactical backup as well.<eos> Whoa, nelson, this operation is supposed to be...<eos> Off the books. I know.<eos> Keep it undercover.
Little Latin, lot of blood.<eos> It rings a bell.<eos> Did you ever stop to think that if I wanted to be cured, I wouldn't have bailed?<eos> That was Crowley.<eos> It really wasn't.<eos> It doesn't matter, all right?<eos> 'Cause whatever went down, whatever happened, we will fix it.<eos> Will we?<eos> 'Cause right now, I'm doing all I can not to come over there and rip your throat out... with my teeth.<eos> I'm giving you a chance, Sam. You should take it.
It wasn't, was it?<eos> No.<eos> The map belonged to the minister.<eos> Do you lie to the children you teach?<eos> No.<eos> So... ..why does a man of principle suddenly tell so many lies in such a short space of time to the policemen?<eos> No?<eos> I think I know.<eos> Because the map is evidence of criminal intent, because it shows planning and forethought, because it establishes common purpose and because it makes you guilty of riot.<eos> Then why would I want to claim it as my own?
Thanks.<eos> Is this your way of trying to get me to eat with you?<eos> Not with me... near me.<eos> I know how important it is for your digestion to eat standing up.<eos> Actually...<eos> That's just an excuse I use because growing up, no one ever wanted to sit with me at lunch.<eos> Now I'm just kind of used to it.<eos> Well, in that case...<eos> Is this seat taken?<eos> When a friendship is real, you can feel it.
They always write the date neatly at the top of the page.<eos> Yeah, they do, don't they?<eos> Last Friday.<eos> You were on the TARDIS last Friday.<eos> Today, you thought the world was going to end.<eos> ~ You still didn't tell me the truth.<eos> ~ I tried.<eos> He interrupted. I just want to know the truth.<eos> I don't care what it is.<eos> I just want to know it.
Dr Chang, your welcome droid has developed a fault.<eos> That's not a droid.<eos> That's my boss.<eos> You know, I might have been guilty of just a teensy, little fibette.<eos> Dr Chang,<eos> I really liked working with you.<eos> I've enjoyed every day of it.<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> - You know, I've even got a little photograph of you looking so sweet,<eos> I'm always going to keep it, always.
Duncan, Nick.<eos> What's your 20?<eos> Oh, his battery is probably dead.<eos> - Yeah, I'll try him on his cellphone.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> It's already done.<eos> They had plenty of chances to stop, and they didn't.<eos> Then again... can't ask a snake to bite its own tail and expect it to listen, can you?<eos> So you have to cut it off and then bring your own heel down as hard as you can... to crush it.
They're way out.<eos> They're never gonna make it in time.<eos> Guys, what is going on?<eos> Okay, Duncan, here's the thing.<eos> Bomb squad is on their way, but it looks like we might have to do this ourselves.<eos> Uh, w... w... why don't you just open the door and just let me out?<eos> We can't.<eos> We can't touch the door.<eos> It's wired.<eos> That'll set it off, all right, you got to sit there.
Douglas Russel.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> We need this dealt with quickly and professionally.<eos> So I've arranged for a spa room where you can examine the, uh,<eos> - massage therapist in question.<eos> - All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> (clears throat) Can I see your tongue?<eos> Where do you want it?
Just total drama.<eos> We got this dirty deeds database and forwarded invites to everyone.<eos> Let the hot guys know they're hot and the not guys know to give up.<eos> So no one has any idea where this database come from?<eos> Some idiot savant freshman?<eos> Idiot?<eos> Those bitches.<eos> That database is well-built.<eos> The integration of the Facebook photos alone...<eos> Stop defending it!
Previously on Awkward...<eos> The dude database has gone full-on viral.<eos> This is gonna really piss some people off.<eos> Hey, I thought you said we couldn't delete<eos> - this stupid database.<eos> - No!<eos> Jenna, I didn't mean you can't delete it!<eos> I mean don't [bleep] delete it!
Gouge out my eyes!<eos> This can't be happening.<eos> Let's go, boys.<eos> Mm. Let's go, girls.<eos> Seriously, you're coming with us.<eos> No, no.<eos> No touching.<eos> They said no touching.<eos> No, dummy.<eos> Gabby is throwing you a surprise party, and you're missing it.
One black noodle for here<eos> It's pretty quiet Maybe because it's a weekday<eos> With this economy, it's no different in the weekend<eos> I just moved and I didn't come around to say hello properly<eos> Have a drink?<eos> Why not<eos> I heard about what happened<eos> I sit here all day but news carries itself here<eos> You must be devastated but maybe it wasn't her fate to have a long life<eos> I think her destined life was average until someone shortened it for her
Saw the lock blown off the door.<eos> They come in here hot. End up dropping all of 'em.<eos> We'll dump 'em in Lincoln Village.<eos> Give those shitheads something to do.<eos> - We don't like paperwork.<eos> - Thanks, Paulie.<eos> This cleanup's gonna require something extra in next week's envelope.<eos> How the hell did the Niners find out where we store our shit?<eos> Not my problem.<eos> You pay me to protect it. I did.
These rogue guys could strike out at the Mayans.<eos> Or the Chinese.<eos> Shit goes down, you need to know it wasn't us.<eos> I got a huge property deal that needs to close, and my business partner's M.I.A.<eos> Our investors are already getting skittish.<eos> The last thing I need is a gang war that brings the Feds sniffing around my relationships.<eos> End this rogue problem.<eos> Now.<eos> I hate to tell you, Mr. Marks, but the war's already on.<eos> And you're losing it.
I would have come for you if you ever worked hard enough to pass out, but you never did.<eos> Look, there's a steakhouse across the street.<eos> Why don't you and I go get something to eat?<eos> What, you gonna break the door down and wake her up?<eos> No, I'm gonna wait outside of it and be there when she does.<eos> Yeah, which won't happen for another eight hours, because they sedated her to make sure she got some sleep.<eos> Come on, let's go get some food.<eos> Don't you need to be at an auction?<eos> Right now, I don't want to be at that sale any more than you do.<eos> You're saying you're willing to postpone it?
The sauce.<eos> - Oh. - Don't even think about it.<eos> I'll cut you.<eos> We don't need a murder scene.<eos> You know that we know the rules.<eos> I know that you're a sneaky little toad that gets night hungers.<eos> - Yeah, that smells so good. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - You tell the story yet?<eos> - Sauce is boiling, right?<eos> You feel like telling it again?
I can't just leave her down there.<eos> You can.<eos> That's the only thing you can do.<eos> I told her I'd come back for her.<eos> You lied.<eos> You lie for a living.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> The ballerina didn't used to spin.<eos> Now it does.<eos> If it's fixed, why are you taking it apart?
No. If Mike wants to talk work, let's talk work.<eos> No, you know what?<eos> You're right, Chuck.<eos> We get so wrapped up in work sometimes.<eos> Well, what's going on?<eos> Does anybody got anything going on in their lives they want to share?<eos> Anybody else having, uh, trouble with the washer?<eos> Yeah, you just have to turn the little knob to the left - until it clicks. - Oh, okay.<eos> It's a knob thing?<eos> 'Cause I was gonna fix it.
I need a baby picture of me for school.<eos> They're doing some section in the yearbook.<eos> Do you have one?<eos> A baby picture?<eos> Honey, don't you remember when this building flooded a few years back?<eos> No.<eos> Well, I had all the pictures in boxes in the basement.<eos> They all got destroyed.<eos> All of them did?<eos> Okay. I do have one picture, but it's my only one, so I would absolutely have to get it back.

You made that mistake once before.<eos> By the way, I've notified the police.<eos> They'll be there any minute.<eos> Yeah, well, you never were a very good liar.<eos> Goodbye, Lori or Janet, or whatever you're calling yourself these days.<eos> You were amazing.<eos> - Was I? - Yes, yes.<eos> Thank you, for choosing us.<eos> This decision must have been very hard.<eos> - I didn't want you to regret it.
Maybe there's a connection.<eos> Let's see what kind of employee Lawrence Anderson is.<eos> When did the accident take place?<eos> Okay, and what was the injury?<eos> Hold on, I'm gonna put you on speaker so my partner can hear this.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Yeah, I was just saying it's a real tragedy what happened to Lawrence a couple of weeks ago.<eos> He suffered some kind of head injury.<eos> Can you describe the injury?<eos> I can describe it, but I can't explain it.
Because the tape from Garrett's bag said visual confirmation required.<eos> Simon said the same thing.<eos> He couldn't get paid by The Benefactor until he had proof that you guys were dead.<eos> So the idea is, what if you kill someone on the dead pool, but you can't send the proof?<eos> You don't get paid.<eos> But how does that get us any closer to The Benefactor?<eos> He still needs to know if the target is really dead.<eos> Especially if it's someone high on the list.<eos> So, if he wants visual confirmation...<eos> He's going to have to come get it himself.
- Everyone okay?<eos> - Basically.<eos> You okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> - I should go.<eos> It's locked.<eos> Why would she lock the door?<eos> Melissa. - I could break it.
So tomorrow, bring it all, as agreed.<eos> But I no longer remember...<eos> Do not worry, Madam.<eos> 1,500, I believe.<eos> Where is the note?<eos> Look for it.<eos> In any case, this sum is not enough.<eos> Care to buy another parcel?<eos> Why don't you sell the entire forest?<eos> Why do you want to keep it?
No one's doing it anymore.<eos> Why the Spanish goatee?<eos> - No?<eos> - It's ugly.<eos> It's filthy!<eos> Shave it off or let your beard grow.<eos> - A full beard's no good.<eos> - What?<eos> - My whiskers are feathers.<eos> - Shave it, I tell you.

It's already time.<eos> - And you, Aksioucha, go back.<eos> - Don't be afraid.<eos> God be with you.<eos> I'm putting my hope in you.<eos> Have you tasted the liqueur?<eos> I don't know if it's any good.<eos> It's very good.<eos> Great!<eos> You make it, no?
A woman offended him.<eos> A director's wife.<eos> He said nothing, but he never forgot about the offense.<eos> Then, at the producer's, there was a cast party.<eos> - Put the gun away.<eos> - Listen, Auntie.<eos> Listen.<eos> Towards the end of the party, he approached the woman:<eos> "Your hand, please."<eos> She gave it to him.
'I am Saibra, mutant human.<eos> 'I have agreed to this memory wipe of my own free will.'<eos> 'This is a recorded message.<eos> 'I am the Architect.<eos> 'Your last memory is of receiving a contact from an unknown agency - me.<eos> 'Everything since has been erased from your minds.<eos> 'Now, pay close attention to this briefing.<eos> 'This is the Bank of Karabraxos. 'The most secure bank in the galaxy.<eos> 'A fortress for the super-rich.<eos> 'If you can afford your own star system, this is where you keep it.
I'm still taking it.<eos> She was driving my old car, and I was like,<eos> "I don't even care."<eos> You know, like, she can have my old life, because I am blazing a new one.<eos> But, Irene, you should have seen her, she's so gross.<eos> Fake hair, fake boobs, and...<eos> Guys... FYI, before I hand out the paychecks, I reserve the cafeteria for my special group today and Wednesday, so...<eos> Uh, I need something, Principal Carl.<eos> Someone has checked out the big TV, even though I use it for serious educational purposes in my classroom every day.<eos> I want it and I need it back.
"An ink splash with dots around it.<eos> "Yes.<eos> Is that it?"<eos> "No, hang on, Charlie.<eos> "Do you see an image?<eos> "Hidden in the ink blot?<eos> "Other people do.<eos> Don't you?"<eos> "No.<eos> "If there's an image, I'll see it.
The paper was covered in boxes and lines.<eos> At one side it said "start" and "finish" at the other.<eos> They said it was a...<eos> A inn Gag".<eos> "You're going to race Algernon<eos> "through the same naze."<eos> Algernon needed a pencil and paper, to make it fair, but I didn't say.<eos> I didn't want to make a fuss.<eos> One of the men in a white jacket had a big watch.<eos> He kept looking at it.
You hesitate.<eos> To kiss?<eos> Or not?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's kiss.<eos> We both went forwards.<eos> We almost bumped heads.<eos> It was only supposed to be a kiss.<eos> So what do I do with my hand?<eos> Put it on her shoulder? Let it hang down?

No, we're going to school now, and then tonight, that is when the adventure begins.<eos> Did you get the Xbox hooked up?<eos> Did I get the Xbox hooked up?<eos> Does Superman fly?<eos> Does Spider-man do spider-man-y things?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Hey, superhero, seriously, the window.<eos> It almost took my finger off.<eos> You said you'd fix it.
- The giant was on TV?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Mr. Castle wet his pants!<eos> Mr. Castle wet his pants!<eos> Oh! No, no... see, the ground was wet!<eos> Yeah. Anton and Mr. Jaffe.<eos> They come in here a lot.<eos> Anton rented a P.O. box here about six months ago,<eos> Box 552.<eos> And he shared it with Jaffe.
Then he tracked down Jaffe and Anton and killed them, too.<eos> He knew that they could i.d. him.<eos> That's what he was looking for... the picture that Anton was gonna use on his passport.<eos> A passport that he desperately needs to get out of this country.<eos> Okay, that photo is at Natalie's place.<eos> Let's go.<eos> He's been here.<eos> Natalie said it was in the bedroom dresser, bottom right drawer.<eos> It's not here.<eos> He must have found it.
Yeah.<eos> Especially when he sees what I put on his back.<eos> - Leslie, one for you?<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> Actually, we have something else for you as well.<eos> This is a medal of outstanding service from the N.Y.P.D. For your invaluable help with tracking down our witness.<eos> What's gonna happen to Jason's sister, anyway?<eos> She's agreed to testify, and with her help, our three victims, along with many, many other people will finally get justice.<eos> Then maybe you should give this medal to her.<eos> I didn't do much to deserve it.
You don't have the clearance for that information anymore.<eos> Then get Secretary Stimson on the phone.<eos> It was his office that downgraded your clearance.<eos> Apparently you pissed on the wrong fire hydrant this time, Dr. Winter.<eos> I know that plutonium is ready.<eos> I talked to Tennessee weeks ago.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> Thin Man won't work.<eos> What?<eos> Twenty years from now, every government on this planet will know how to design a bomb, but they won't be able to build it because purifying plutonium to a base level takes more manpower and resources than building the pyramids.
You know, your software is decent, but it relies on three-point bone structure ratio, and that's pretty hard to compute when half of someone's face is covered.<eos> How do you know so much about top-secret government software?<eos> I may know someone who hacked into it.<eos> Be that as it may,<eos> I'll rely on my technology.<eos> Cabe, let's go, but I'm done with your friends.<eos> Pump your brakes before you say something brilliant.<eos> The truth is his $80 million software was beaten by a hat and sunglasses.<eos> What did we say earlier about a chain of command?<eos> You need to follow it.
Are we meeting the others here?<eos> No, they're back at the campsite, but there's fresh water nearby, and ye look like ye could use it.<eos> Water?<eos> Where?<eos> Down.<eos> Bit of a climb for a drink, is it not?<eos> There's a stink to it, but it will wet your thrapple sure enough.<eos> Are ye a spy for the english or the french?<eos> How many times must I answer that same question?<eos> I promise, this is the last time I'll ever ask it of ye.
Use their names.<eos> Can I speak to you for a second?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Anyone could see us.<eos> Who are you?<eos> What?<eos> You been dealing drugs?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I saw you bike to the docks this morning.<eos> I saw you pick up the cooler and drop it off at the taxi.
This is a choice.<eos> This is a choice.<eos> You should have told me.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Why didn't you?<eos> I just didn't think it mattered.<eos> My son is there every fucking day.<eos> - Are they doing coke around him?<eos> - No, of course not.<eos> We don't do it ourselves.
First, there's something else I've got to tell you.<eos> Give me a minute.<eos> You saw Oscar call the police?<eos> - You actually saw him?<eos> - Yes, I told you, yes.<eos> Because I didn't see you when I came by.<eos> - I was in the back.<eos> - Hey, Scotty, you got the keys?<eos> - Yep. - All right, let's wrap it up.<eos> Cole, we need to dump this shit, throw it in the ocean.
I found your gift.<eos> Must have fallen off the night stand.<eos> It was next to my bed.<eos> It's so beautiful.<eos> I was surprised you didn't mention it last night at the engagement dinner.<eos> Now I know why.<eos> Aw, were you sitting there the whole time thinking I hated it?<eos> Not the whole time.<eos> All right, the whole time.<eos> This song... mom used to sing it to me, didn't she?
That's two times you've come to see me in the last two weeks.<eos> Why?<eos> Jim Dobbs died.<eos> I came to tell you, but you were high.<eos> So?<eos> I thought you'd want to know.<eos> Why are you still wearing her coat?<eos> It's not going to bring her back.<eos> I'm not trying to bring her back, Mom.<eos> Should throw it away.
So?<eos> I thought you'd want to know.<eos> Why are you still wearing her coat?<eos> It's not going to bring her back.<eos> I'm not trying to bring her back, Mom.<eos> Should throw it away.<eos> Doesn't even fit you.<eos> Just get a new one.<eos> That's what I'd do.<eos> I like wearing it.
This handle does not belong with that toilet.<eos> They're two different brands.<eos> Maybe the landlord replaced it.<eos> Yeah, but the newer handles Are usually plastic or stainless steel.<eos> This one's brass. Look. Hmm.<eos> Nice.<eos> A little too nice for a landlord to spend money on.<eos> What if that handle was somewhere else When paul wescourt touched it?<eos> Wouldn't take more than a wrench<eos> For someone to relocate it here.
Yeah.<eos> This could be the last summer of Hankmed.<eos> - You poached my nanny?<eos> - Typical new mom mistake.<eos> Never introduce a great nanny to a desperate mother.<eos> So now tomorrow, I'll have to spend all day interviewing nannies, the ironic part being that while I'll have 12 nannies in your kitchen,<eos> I'll have no one to watch over Sashi. Hey, what's the score?<eos> Gotta get a picture of Ricky.<eos> You're probably not gonna get much for that photo.<eos> Oh, I was just gonna put it on Instagram for my friends back home.

We have to just make this call.<eos> No.<eos> Two minutes.<eos> No.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> You know the rules.<eos> Yep.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> I, uh... I can't get Liz's address cos that bitch Sanger, whatever, won't give it to me.
Not me.<eos> He hits her!<eos> I've seen it!<eos> I was in the car.<eos> And Daddy made me lie to the police.<eos> I just got a call from my plant at Stalkerazzi.<eos> Somebody's got a video of the Re-Kon shootings.<eos> Did you get it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, when am I gonna see it?
This is gonna hurt.<eos> No, no, no...<eos> I don't have any money.<eos> And I want any trouble.<eos> Why don't you just let us inside and open that register?<eos> No trouble just cash.<eos> And if I refuse?<eos> Things'll get messy.<eos> I can't believe you did that.<eos> Just pulled it right out...
Yeah, I just...<eos> I got called into work.<eos> Yeah, so I just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick, in person, you know?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> I want to say that I'll support you no matter what...<eos> Oh. Wait, wait.<eos> That's... that's what I want to say.<eos> But that's not how I feel.<eos> I want to start a life with you.<eos> And I don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid.
- Hey, Cole. Guys headed out?<eos> It's pumping out there this morning.<eos> Staying at Phoebe's?<eos> That's right.<eos> It's nice having her back, isn't it?<eos> Hey, this place looks great.<eos> Yeah, I fixed it up.<eos> I did a bunch of work on it while you were gone.<eos> Turned pretty well.<eos> It should help you when you try to sell it.
I... You know, it just amazes me that after 20 years, you really think that you know somebody, but it turns out you don't know them at all.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> Why don't you know what to say?<eos> You've had four fucking months to figure it out.<eos> Why come back here if you don't know what to say?<eos> Oh, my God. I cannot fucking believe you.<eos> You didn't come back to talk to me at all, did you?<eos> It's almost summer.<eos> You came back to sell the fucking house.<eos> Wait, what if I sold it to you?
Think caterpillar and butterfly.<eos> They're born with all the DNA necessary to create both insects, but the butterfly DNA remains inactive.<eos> Slowly, it...activates, encourages the caterpillar to... Create and enter a chrysalis.<eos> Once inside, the butterfly DNA fully activates.<eos> And when the cocoon opens, uh...the butterfly emerges.<eos> What happens to the caterpillar?<eos> It's...gone.<eos> So...<eos> Lexi's gone?<eos> I -- all I'm saying is you can't cut a caterpillar out of its chrysalis without killing it.
Well, let's bring him down here so he can confirm your story.<eos> I would never disclose military secrets.<eos> Prove it.<eos> No, I can't. I can't prove it.<eos> I can't prove that I'm not the Tooth Fairy either.<eos> You can't prove a negative.<eos> You scientists do it all the time.<eos> What do you call it?<eos> A null hypothesis?<eos> If you can't prove your theory is valid, you examine the opposite theory and try to refute it.
I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> We're building an atomic bomb.<eos> It'll set off a chain reaction that will explode with the power of 20,000 tons of TNT.<eos> Twenty thousand tons?<eos> Powerful enough to wipe cities off the map.<eos> Cities full of people.<eos> Children.<eos> No, the Army will detonate it someplace where it can't hurt anyone.
I know.<eos> Emma?<eos> Emma?<eos> It appears our honeymoon is over.<eos> Yeah, there's an emergency.<eos> Emma's trapped under ice by a woman with some kind of ice magic.<eos> And this involves me because?<eos> You're the bloody dark one.<eos> Do something.<eos> Well, I could melt the ice and destroy it with a thought, but that would also destroy your girlfriend.
One more.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - All right, so my point is, I just don't want to be some symbol of patriotism.<eos> No kidding.<eos> It's depressing.<eos> Whenever they bring one of those army guys out to sing the National Anthem, I'm like, "No.<eos> - Where's Beyoncé?"<eos> - So, how do I get - people to treat me normal?<eos> - Stop talking about it all the time!<eos> If you have a bad thought, just push it down.
Good.<eos> Whatever it takes.<eos> But what if something goes wrong? You know, I...<eos> We don't want you to get hurt.<eos> Nothing's gonna go wrong.<eos> Dad always told me you can't live in fear.<eos> That you had to face life head-on.<eos> Funny, he spent his whole life hiding.<eos> He wanted you to know the truth, or he wouldn't have written that letter.<eos> You mind if I see it?
Alex, your popliteal artery is compromised.<eos> I need to reduce the dislocation, or you could lose your leg.<eos> Yeah, okay. Whatever you got to do, doc.<eos> Still hurts.<eos> His femoral condyles must have gone through the quadricep.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> The top of his femur has pierced the leg muscle and locked it in place.<eos> Unfortunately, to make it better, first I need to make it worse.<eos> Charlotte, hold his shoulders.<eos> Boris, grab his thigh and hold it steady, okay?
Drones.<eos> Drones.<eos> Guys are flying them around neighborhoods now, scoping' out your house like a hummingbird at a tulip.<eos> Camera on the drone records what's inside.<eos> The thieves wait till you're off at work and...<eos> What do you do about drones?<eos> I just emailed you an appraisal.<eos> Alarms at every entry point, windows, doors, and a full closed-circuit camera system.<eos> And it comes with the app, right?<eos> I just download it...
This is slave labor.<eos> Max.<eos> You can be arrested for this.<eos> - I think the chicken's ready.<eos> - One second.<eos> Yes, it's ready to flip.<eos> What's casein?<eos> Okay, let's not light the stove right now.<eos> Dad, what do I do with this turkey?<eos> How do I cook it?
You have a very nice place here.<eos> Mickey speaks very highly of you.<eos> Shorty, this is my son, uh, Daryll.<eos> Daryll, meet my buddy Shorty.<eos> Hey.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Listen.<eos> I know that you always wanted that car.<eos> It was wrong for me to give that to Conor.<eos> You take it.
Mickey speaks very highly of you.<eos> Shorty, this is my son, uh, Daryll.<eos> Daryll, meet my buddy Shorty.<eos> Hey.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Listen.<eos> I know that you always wanted that car.<eos> It was wrong for me to give that to Conor.<eos> You take it.<eos> You know, fix it up a little bit.
I'm gonna need that shiv.<eos> Red!<eos> More.<eos> Hang around for a minute.<eos> Ferguson's using you to get at me.<eos> Now it wouldn't be the first time a screw's played that game.<eos> But a Governor?<eos> That's something else.<eos> I never gave Simmo that gear.<eos> I never even had a chance to cut it before the screws confiscated it.
No.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> I don't have it.<eos> What is this, some kind of set up?<eos> What... What is all this?<eos> Fuckin' just give me my card back.<eos> Give me my fuckin'... just give me my fuckin' card!<eos> You set me up you fuckin' slut!<eos> Now give it to me.
Mike.<eos> - Thanks for coming by.<eos> - You're lucky it's on my way.<eos> I told the valet I'd be down in five minutes.<eos> So you listened to my whole message?<eos> Yeah, and I don't get it.<eos> You were gunning for this guy Simon like he'd screwed your wife or something.<eos> Circumstances have changed.<eos> I need you to make the whole thing go away.<eos> You can't exactly release the kraken and just call it back, Neil.
Thank God.<eos> Is she all right?<eos> Give her to me.<eos> Eli, please...give her to me.<eos> Eli, give me my child!<eos> She was in the road.<eos> Oh, God...<eos> I just left her, just for a minute.<eos> I've been telling Cassie the story of how the violin was made.<eos> Do you know it?
Gun bunkers always stink of shit and piss.<eos> And no-one ever knows where they're properly hidden.<eos> So we won't be disturbed, OK?<eos> It's tannin, for your wound.<eos> Help the healing.<eos> May soothe the pain.<eos> Why do you care?<eos> Because I need you to walk.<eos> I'm going to soothe it, bind it, and then you're going to walk on it.<eos> Maybe you should have thought of that before you broke it.
Use it now.<eos> Finish the song.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I did not take a risk.<eos> I just wanted out of the house.<eos> And you just happened to end up at my place?<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> Well, I'm starting to.<eos> And I guess I'm a little disappointed now.<eos> Look, if you finish it, give me a call if you want.
Rub a dub dub.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, I think I have your shoe.<eos> Oh.<eos> - That's where that went.<eos> - Mm-hmm. Yeah.<eos> - Fun.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Mm.<eos> Well, if you want it back at all, you can always drop by later and pick it up.
Frankly, I never thought that they were cut out for...<eos> That thing is trying to get into my annex?<eos> You led that back here?<eos> Not now! Aah!<eos> Hey!<eos> This is delicate.<eos> That's good, too.<eos> Come on, then.<eos> Give me that thread.<eos> If you drop it, we're all doomed.
He still talks about fixing it up and moving to Channel Lake, God bless him.<eos> You used to love spending the fourth there, having Roman candle fights with the neighborhood kids.<eos> I don't remember that.<eos> Do you know what I do remember about the 4th of July?<eos> What?<eos> The time I found you OD'd on the kitchen floor.<eos> I didn't think a 70 pound girl could lift a grown woman like that.<eos> But see, I knew I couldn't call 911 for help 'cause then CPS would take me from you.<eos> Yeah, I dragged you into the bathtub.<eos> Kept filling it with ice cubes.
Big career. Big career, man.<eos> Just...<eos> Man. What happened?<eos> I got too obsessed.<eos> Yeah, yeah, to the point where I'd walk by a vending machine, and if I didn't see any corn nuts, - I'd go ballistic. - Ohh.<eos> Pretty much killed my second marriage, but anyhow...<eos> I don't know. I was alone.<eos> And... I said, "the hell with it.<eos> I'm going west."<eos> Came upon this place, bought it for nothing, and been running it for close to now 20 years.
Jesus. You see, nothing makes sense to me, Juice.<eos> Is my kid delusional?<eos> Cutting himself, making up stories?<eos> Or is he tormented?<eos> You see, every scenario seems insane to me.<eos> My son is twisted up.<eos> He just lost his mom.<eos> Before I send in a team of shrinks to twist him up more and to create deeper wounds...<eos> I need the truth.<eos> Somehow, I know... you're the one who can give it to me.
She's lying.<eos> I know that face.<eos> Just spit it out, Abby.<eos> The bullet is still shifting.<eos> That's why you're in pain.<eos> I was hoping that it would stabilize by now.<eos> So how about you take it out?<eos> Raven, we need to talk about that.<eos> The bullet is pressing on your spine.<eos> If we leave it in, you'll live, but you'll never walk again.
This whole intersex thing really humanized her.<eos> Poor thing.<eos> Yeah, it is really sad.<eos> Oh, it was just so much easier when we could just hate her.<eos> Okay, Sven, check out your antlers.<eos> Shane, meet Theo.<eos> He's new at school, so I invited him out with us tonight.<eos> Oh, you can be Elsa.<eos> I have the dress.<eos> I was gonna wear it, but it felt... expected.
- That feel good?<eos> - So good.<eos> What if, like, now that it's in the open, like, we lose our mojo?<eos> You mean because Barb knows?<eos> Okay, please let's not say her name while you're fucking me.<eos> All I'm thinking about is you.<eos> - You're my baby.<eos> - Get the dick.<eos> Get the dick, get the dick, get the dick!<eos> Okay, I'll get it.
Oh, no.<eos> No, no.<eos> - You're gonna leave me here?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Hey, um, I just wanted to tell you that I like your shirt.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's, uh, flannel.<eos> Flannel. So versatile.<eos> I wear it every day.
- Are you in town just to see Hank?<eos> - I'm also here to consult with a surgeon that Hank knows who does corneal transplants.<eos> - You hired the lawyer, the one that helped viviana.<eos> - I had to do something to make up for interfering.<eos> - Cinco's parents are suing hankmed.<eos> You know that picture of you sticking a needle into cinco's ass?<eos> They saw that, and now they're out for blood.<eos> - Emma, did you sell that photo of cinco and me to snarkhampton?<eos> - [Crying] I sent that photo to some of the people who were at the party.<eos> One of them must've sold it to snarkhampton.
Let's just wait till I'm out of surgery.<eos> I don't know if you've noticed, but she can be a little high-strung.<eos> This could push her into a full-blown breakdown, and the therapy bill's already high enough as it is.<eos> - Okay, well, in that case, it'll just be me and the worm in the waiting room.<eos> I'm keeping him as a pet.<eos> And I named him cinco Jr., which, I guess, is technically seis.<eos> [Both laugh] [Cell phone rings] Oh, I actually have to go.<eos> Someone's new car is here.<eos> - Oh. - But I'll be back by the time you wake up.<eos> - Okay. - Hey, where are they dropping it off?
- First, I did it because I knew mom would read it.<eos> And then she became such a fan.<eos> And she calls me every morning to talk about it.<eos> - She calls you?<eos> - We talk about the site... And other stuff.<eos> We've been talking, cinco, really talking... For the first time.<eos> - You got mom's attention.<eos> But you did it at a lot of peoples' expense.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't want to post the picture, but then I thought if mom saw it, she'd show up.
You were in a city.<eos> - How can you tell?<eos> - Out the window.<eos> - It's completely white.<eos> - Not completely.<eos> Skyscrapers.<eos> - So, do you know where this is?<eos> - No.<eos> But this view out the window, the configuration of buildings ought to be unique.<eos> So you can find it?
Maybe you should leave.<eos> Maybe you want to tell me more.<eos> You're sure you have it this time?<eos> Looks familiar?<eos> They claimed my... DNA was on it.<eos> Now we'll never know.<eos> How did it go?<eos> Not well.<eos> Do you still have that slip?<eos> I just gave it to Donne.
That's the question, isn't it?<eos> - Be careful, Frank.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You too.<eos> They are OK?<eos> They're down to two trucks.<eos> What is it?<eos> Where'd you get the key?<eos> I stole it from Kedar's tent.<eos> I'm to return it before he notices.
- How much money?<eos> - A lot.<eos> And this was after we gave her a car to use.<eos> Thank you, gentlemen.<eos> Hopefully, this will help.<eos> An apartment from one couple, a car from another.<eos> - What else did she get?<eos> - Murdered, for one thing.<eos> So the car she was driving came from you?<eos> I mean, she didn't even drive it.
Some things never change.<eos> There's something I want you to see.<eos> That's it.<eos> That's it.<eos> Not a bad fighter.<eos> Yep. Raul taught him well.<eos> What happened to this place being on the chopping block?<eos> Well, Fabian came clean to the local business council about Delgros' bribe, and after what happened to Raul, no one wanted to sell.<eos> Best part, it's too late for Delgros to back out of finishing the new playground he promised us.<eos> There's talk of naming it after Raul.
- I live here.<eos> You can leave whenever you want to, but this is my home, and...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to upset you.<eos> But it's just, something about you drives me fucking insane.<eos> I don't think we should see each other anymore, okay?<eos> Oh, come on. Look, I need your help with the book.<eos> You're my insider.<eos> Okay, from now on, this is just a strictly professional relationship, okay?<eos> Okay. If your hand just happens to find its way into my pants, then I will remove it promptly and admonish you for your vulgarity.
Or ours.<eos> - You seem very happy.<eos> - What?<eos> In these photos.<eos> You really look very happy.<eos> Where?<eos> Do you still have the blue Clio?<eos> No, no.<eos> It wasn't an accident.<eos> He brought me the car like this, he wanted me to scrap it, he's given me the papers and then he left.

Exactly...<eos> He is alive, and your reaction is to hide behind a haze of pills.<eos> No. My reaction was happiness.<eos> But you ruined that and made meeting my father all about hurting Emily.<eos> What do you really want from me, Mom?<eos> Nothing but to see you happy.<eos> The Grayson mantra...<eos> Lie and deny.<eos> I'm sick of it.<eos> I do want a relationship with my father, but not if you're gonna be controlling it.
Call me "fingers."<eos> Hey, I remember this guy.<eos> That's probably because you've arrested him twice for pickpocketing.<eos> You have a criminal helping you?<eos> That's crazy!<eos> Grow up, Amy.<eos> Now, we will all work together as a team to move the captain into position.<eos> Once there, fingers...<eos> Loving that code name...<eos> Will remove the captain's watch and replace it with this replica watch.
Last Halloween, after you won the bet, I went back to my office to do everyone's paperwork, but I did no paperwork. I started to plot my revenge.<eos> I began by creating a word cloud.<eos> But how could you possibly have known I was gonna try and steal your watch?<eos> I knew you would try to take something important to me.<eos> During the year, I drew your attention to my watch.<eos> You're eight minutes late.<eos> You're 14 minutes late.<eos> You're three minutes early...<eos> In Chicago.<eos> You annoyed me into stealing it.
Fortunately, it walked through the door, handcuffed to Diaz.<eos> This scumbag pickpocket is Dan McCreary.<eos> He can take anything off of anyone.<eos> Anything?<eos> Anyone?<eos> The look on your face, priceless.<eos> I put McCreary into my employ immediately.<eos> Fast-forward to this morning.<eos> You commenced your plan.<eos> McCreary stole my watch, and then replaced it with the replica.
I knew Boyle would never knowingly betray me.<eos> With your jacket and shoes gone, you didn't look like a cop, but you still had your badge.<eos> That is, until you entered the party bus.<eos> Rosa's feline dancing distracted you as a mysterious partier stole your badge on...<eos> Halloween!<eos> It was you in the mask!<eos> You sly son of a bitch!<eos> Well done.<eos> But I do have to ask, those guys at the impound, did they really smash my car?<eos> No, in fact, I had them wash it.
Shall we anyway?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Martha!<eos> Your letter, I got it.<eos> It's... beautiful.<eos> But it was late, so...<eos> I'm glad you got it.<eos> Yeah, thank you!<eos> It was lucky I found it.
Bohannon.<eos> You and me got unfinished business.<eos> Suppose that's right.<eos> What do you say we settle things right now?<eos> I'm all done with killin'.<eos> Well, maybe you gonna get killed.<eos> I'm gonna arrest you.<eos> Well, why don't you come on over here and try.<eos> Drop that gun.<eos> Yeah, come on and take it.
A scarf.<eos> Oliver's scarf.<eos> ~ A coincidence, perhaps.<eos> ~ No, no, no. You don't understand.<eos> I don't mean it's the KIND of scarf Oliver was wearing that night, I mean, it's exactly the one.<eos> Emily had it made for him, with his initials on it - look...<eos> ONH.<eos> You're telling me that a scarf with my son's initials on it, shows up in the same town from which he was taken, and it's a coincidence?<eos> It's his, Julien.<eos> Huh? That means someone left it somewhere.
How can you be so relaxed?<eos> I'm not relaxed.<eos> I'm just getting used to it.<eos> You've clearly been spending a lot of time with Julien.<eos> It's good for you.<eos> Before I came out here, Mark and I called off the wedding.<eos> Oh, no. I'm sorry.<eos> Sometimes I wonder if I was just lying to myself anyway.<eos> Like having this new family was just a plaster to cover up the pain, to stop the bleeding.<eos> Maybe I don't want to cover it up any more.
I'm sorry.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> (I'm sorry.)<eos> This bloody place.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> I'm a bit drunk.<eos> Let's get you back to your hotel.<eos> Oh, no, let's just wait here a moment.<eos> This place... it's actually beautiful.<eos> I've spent so long resenting this town, I forgot to ever really look at it.
Do you?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I mean, that's why I wanted you to know how much I respect Anika and you and Mrs. Truman.<eos> Mateo, why are you really here?<eos> What the hell are you doing in my house?<eos> Hey! I said how did you get in here?<eos> I found your spare key the first time I was here while you and Rosalie were busy.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I should've asked first.<eos> I came to give it back.
She was really talking about herself.<eos> She and Blake were working against the government.<eos> Okay, we just watched Agent Wolfe...<eos> She shot him, right in front of us.<eos> Yeah, well, she had to.<eos> To keep him from being questioned, or he would end up exposing her.<eos> Blake could never succeed.<eos> He would just end up being arrested with the weapon and the investigation would have fallen out of her hands.<eos> Shit, if you're right, she's an evil genius.<eos> Yeah, and if Frank hands her that weapon, he'll just be giving it to the terrorists he's trying to stop.
Stop him!<eos> Come into my place!<eos> Fuck you!<eos> You son-of-a-bitch!<eos> That was for my father.<eos> It's Frank, he's coming out!<eos> He's got the case.<eos> You got it, Frank.<eos> Where's the weapon?<eos> Destroyed, along with all the research to develop it.
Give me that picture we took for Ralph.<eos> She posed in our suite.<eos> Our floor was perfectly aligned with the tiger's eyes on the casino across the street.<eos> The angle on this footage is by its mouth.<eos> This camera was on another floor.<eos> Someone spliced these tapes.<eos> I'm gonna have to look into this.<eos> You do that.<eos> That was so badass.<eos> Whoever framed Walter is desperate enough to fudge film and then give it to the cops.
- Hey.<eos> - Cole's here.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I needed to talk to you.<eos> I'm going to the store.<eos> What? No. This is your apartment.<eos> It's okay.<eos> The coke is gone.<eos> - What do you mean? I...<eos> - I mean it's gone. We buried it, we went to dig it up, and it wasn't there.
Bellyache.<eos> It's his conscience pricking.<eos> Most times, fit to puke.<eos> 'Twas meat I ate two days past.<eos> The day your child was born?<eos> What is this?<eos> This is Isabelle's tonic.<eos> I just started. It helps some.<eos> I can offer you the recipe.<eos> You must keep it to yourself.
Where are you going?<eos> To do what I should have done long ago.<eos> - A talk with the police.<eos> - Do not do that, Pilar.<eos> ? my niece.<eos> Mine too.<eos> The police must not know, Pilar.<eos> - Maybe you're right.<eos> - On what?<eos> That have hidden the child and then take it away.
-S ? , Sure.<eos> By Woods, go take a walk.<eos> Come on, Ruso.<eos> Thank you.<eos> V? Ctor Lake.<eos> Rafael Vidal.<eos> I see that the Church bored.<eos> Neither I prayed ... finch? I was not diagnosed with cancer.<eos> I was given six months, about this ... seven years ago.<eos> I understand that there is a divine law ... and that we must accept it.
One of them, however, has the broccoli blended in.<eos> Bart picks one of the smoothies and drinks it-- maybe he had the broccoli, maybe he didn't.<eos> No one knows, so neither of you has given in, and this horrible impasse can come to an end.<eos> Uh, works for me. I'm in.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Oh, no, the broccoli.<eos> You did that on purpose!<eos> You lick this table clean! Come on.<eos> Lick it.<eos> Come on, now, you can still lick it.
Here.<eos> Why don't you two gentlemen sit down and make yourselves comfortable?<eos> All right, Mr. Landry, he's all yours.<eos> And, Will, I'll be right over there.<eos> Question one... you're getting a lot of money from the government for the 50 years you spent in prison, am I right?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - How does it feel getting all that money for just sitting around?<eos> Are you trying to say my time in prison was nothing but sitting around?<eos> Prison is a hard life and I think I'm being compensated fairly<eos> - for enduring it. - Mm-hmm.
Right.<eos> But you and me... Are we...<eos> What's up?<eos> I don't know, Emma.<eos> What is up?<eos> Uh, is everything okay?<eos> Emma, did you sell that photo of Cinco and me to Snarkhampton?<eos> I never meant to hurt you.<eos> I never meant to hurt either one of you.<eos> I was so mad at Cinco, and so I sent that photo to some of the people who were at the party, and one of them must've sold it to Snarkhampton.
It's all good.<eos> Good.<eos> Okay, so I've got the Henderson twins' vaccinations at 10:00 and Ms. Newberg's annual physical at noon.<eos> Which, of course, will turn into a three-Martini lunch.<eos> For her, not for me.<eos> I've got back-to-back patients needing MRIs.<eos> You're lending me your Navy tie, Henry.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> I love that tie.<eos> - And you won't return it.
Come on! Come on!<eos> - Let's go!<eos> This way!<eos> - ATF!<eos> Get on the ground!<eos> I'd have appreciated a heads-up the ATF was coming.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> I have no idea why they're here.<eos> Lose the gun, Russell.<eos> Lose it.
Maybe she's got a pill problem and Zaz was her dealer.<eos> He was doing something bad.<eos> I heard they found a gun in his room.<eos> What?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Carmen from dry cleaning saw the cops carrying it out of the room in one of those little baggies.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> What if Petra has a real drug problem?<eos> Okay, here's what you do.<eos> You need to find a way to get Petra's urine so you can test it.
I would.<eos> And I should be very glad to.<eos> So, ~ there is my challenge. ~ (CHUCKLES)<eos> How do you get rid of all this scum?<eos> It's the onions - they're only supposed to sweat, but I think they fell down exhausted.<eos> And you went a bit mad with the salt.<eos> Shall we taste it?<eos> Oh, my God! (COUGHS)<eos> Why don't I just make a bottle of it?<eos> Then I could bring it to the house, you could warm it through and serve it.
Wait. We're talking about Louise Rubin here?<eos> Oh, she's the coolest.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> She'll cut the top off her shirt just to show her shoulder.<eos> Well, I can do that.<eos> See? I'm just as cool as the next mom.<eos> - W-what are you doing?<eos> - I'm trying to expose my shoulder!<eos> Poop. I just stretched it out.
You speak English.<eos> I was aiming for the eastern United States.<eos> Did I make it?<eos> This is the dead zone, on the way to the city of light.<eos> I am Sienna.<eos> You must eat, then rest.<eos> Good.<eos> Mmm! Thank you.<eos> - Is the city of light your home?<eos> - It will be, if we can find it.
Refugee camp up in Alberta.<eos> Over a million people.<eos> No food. No water.<eos> It got ugly.<eos> They all turned in a week.<eos> We should've kept running.<eos> You couldn't get around them?<eos> This herd is miles wide.<eos> I mean, it's got a mind of its own.<eos> You can't move fast enough to get around it.
I'd still be there if it weren't for Walter.<eos> He's pretty exceptional.<eos> Don't tell him I said that.<eos> You spooked him.<eos> He won't talk.<eos> The FBI gave us one hour with him and we're at zero.<eos> That's what happens when a guy gets chased by a bunch of weirdos in a van covered in chicken feathers.<eos> The FBI searched his house, his storage locker, his records, everything, turned up nothing.<eos> The painting's worth $100 mil.<eos> If he doesn't talk fast, we'll never see it again.
You lied.<eos> And you're out of time.<eos> Hit him again.<eos> If Alpha's on the ground, maybe other stations are, too.<eos> You're from Alpha, right?<eos> My dad was chief guard.<eos> He sure loved having a thief for a kid.<eos> Hey. You're a great thief.<eos> These are the engineering schematics for this whole place.<eos> If there's a way out, we're gonna find it.
You know what's in... in the salmon?<eos> You don't know?<eos> No, sir!<eos> There's omega 3.<eos> Tons of omega... 3.<eos> Know what that is?<eos> Something that protects the heart.<eos> It's a molecule.<eos> The weak spot for us fat people is the pump.<eos> We have to strengthen it.
Addy and friends.<eos> You guys got to seek shelter immediately because this is bad.<eos> And when you seek shelter immediately and after you do that, you need to contact me and tell me where you are.<eos> And I'll update you with further instructions.<eos> Okay?<eos> All right, well this is Citizen Z, and I'm signing off.<eos> Who's Addy?<eos> So which way do we go?<eos> The storm is pushing north from the gulf.<eos> If we make it to the I-70, we can outrun it.
Come on.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Now look at this one, and look at all the flowers in it.<eos> Here we grow our vegetables.<eos> We have chickens and cows out back.<eos> Cows? You get milk?<eos> Milk, butter, yogurt.<eos> Most importantly for you, penicillin.<eos> Amy makes it herself.
You see, huh?<eos> I'm a reasonable man.<eos> I'm sure we can come to some kind of an arrangement.<eos> Why don't you just tell me what you want?<eos> Let me ask.<eos> These girls with you voluntarily?<eos> Didn't think so.<eos> Hey, hey, listen to me.<eos> That saddlebag, it's full of oxycontin.<eos> You can take it.
Who cares?<eos> Who cares? Who cares?<eos> You probably will.<eos> Oh. Boyle, I love that you're trying to step up your sex game.<eos> But strength is not your issue.<eos> Stop humming.<eos> And it does not turn me on when you bend over and back up into me.<eos> Did someone check out the camera this morning?<eos> Yes. Hitchcock.<eos> And if he sees it, he will tell everyone.
All it took was one mistake?<eos> You think that semicolon was a mistake?<eos> No, it was a juicy piece of bait and she unhinged her jaw and swallowed it whole.<eos> So, you wanted her to say no to us?<eos> Rejecting a valid request for such a petty reason? That's all the ammunition I need to go over her head.<eos> I secretly scheduled us a one-on-one with Madeline's boss, Chief Fisker.<eos> You want to hear the funniest thing ever?<eos> I also split an infinitive and she didn't notice.<eos> Did you check out the department video camera by any chance?<eos> Yeah, I was going to take it home and videotape the top of my head.

I want it back.

I want it back.<eos> Why?<eos> What's on it?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just really need it for no reason.
All right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Are you okay, sir?<eos> I don't want to sound dramatic, but today has been sub-optimal.<eos> That doesn't leave this office.<eos> Wuntch beat me, the squad was a disaster, and in the end, do you know who I'm angriest with?<eos> Yourself?<eos> No. Wuntch.<eos> I need this task force to succeed, and there's not a detective here who is adult enough to lead it.
If you ever want to visit the area, don't hesitate to call me.<eos> Later.<eos> U-turn.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Here for my complaint?<eos> Will it go through?<eos> That's not why I'm here, Mrs Guennegan.<eos> - Is this the wardrobe you sold?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Where did you get it?
This place is mine, I inherited it.<eos> Then why not get the keys from the solicitor?<eos> Why are you here?<eos> To get another child's body?<eos> No!<eos> I have nothing to do with the mummy.<eos> I just came to get a watch.<eos> I swear.<eos> A gold watch.<eos> My uncle Patrick hid it somewhere.
Haven't you forgotten something?<eos> I couldn't just let you go like that.<eos> Remember the promise we made to each other?<eos> He's kneeling, he's going to propose.<eos> My God.<eos> You thought I'd get saddled with that, smart ass?<eos> It's 128 lira.<eos> If you don't trust me, check the bill.<eos> Here, look.<eos> Don't be shy, go on, look at it.
Rumor is they'll get married but I don't find it likely at all.<eos> The woman is already married to someone else.<eos> Do you have any other questions, my child?<eos> Just one little thing I'm wondering about.<eos> Are you making fun of me, old man?<eos> This is a serious station.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm saying:<eos> May the helmet of the astronaut who tightens the screws on the satellite that broadcasts the frequency of this station squeeze your cheeks, Mr Uncle.<eos> This station, I wouldn't even take a bus from it.
All right, be careful.<eos> We'll be there as soon as we can.<eos> I'll be here.<eos> What have you done?<eos> We needed a woman, now we have one.<eos> She's perfect.<eos> You idiot!<eos> Can't you see she's a police officer?<eos> We'll cut up the car.<eos> They'll never find it or her.
Cornelius.<eos> Father.<eos> Let me get our big baby boy.<eos> Look at you, John, a regular frontiersman.<eos> Mr. Caze!<eos> Mr. Caze was kind enough to fill me in.<eos> He tells me there's a mine, and miners short on pay.<eos> You're emptying my pockets.<eos> The mine belongs to me.<eos> - I sunk it.
That's because I'm always in a room full of idiots.<eos> Watch out for him.<eos> Oh, yeah? Why's that?<eos> He's a loose cannon.<eos> He thinks he's a white knight jumping into the breach like some idiot in the movies.<eos> You're talking about Bullock here?<eos> We're talking about Bullock here.<eos> Harvey Bullock?<eos> Detective Bullock, do you want to settle the bill for this month now or should we send it to you?<eos> You can just put it in the mail, thanks.
Anyway, there was this table in that movie, and they were always laughing around it and eating on plates with candles, and the whole house just seemed so fresh and beachy.<eos> Of course, it was actually at the beach, so that probably did...<eos> What?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We're not gonna get it.<eos> Who says? Let...<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Why not?<eos> Mike, we're trying to save for college, and we already have a table.<eos> We'll give it to Axl.
It did not go well.<eos> For people who make tiny furniture for the pleasure of children, they're real douche bags.<eos> Well, guess there's only one thing we can do.<eos> We got to replace the rest of our stuff with tiny stuff, or this table is gonna look ridiculous.<eos> Oh, Mike, I'm sorry.<eos> I was dumb.<eos> I was so dumb!<eos> Eh, it's not your fault.<eos> It's both of ours.<eos> We tried to find joy, and the universe clearly does not want us to have it.
"Touchdown.<eos> Your A+ is in Messner's top drawer."<eos> Sent the day he died.<eos> Do we know by whom?<eos> VidTree snapshots disappear after a couple seconds.<eos> Kids use them, 'cause they think that they can send something without their parents ever finding out.<eos> But in reality, all the data is still saved up in the cloud, where we can eventually find it.<eos> I'm... doing a search on the sender as we speak.<eos> So, if you're right, then this answer key was left in Messner's classroom for Turk to find.<eos> And Messner found it first.
You needed it to save Mason.<eos> You're the one who killed Turk and Messner.<eos> Your original plan wasn't too bad.<eos> I mean, you heard the rumblings around school that Turk was looking for the Chem IV test answers.<eos> It's pretty easy, setting him up.<eos> This is you entering the school library at 1:16.<eos> That's the same day that Chet Messner was killed.<eos> And at 1:19, you logged on to a computer using Hannah Hunt's password.<eos> You logged on to VidTree, and you sent a message to Rob Turkla.<eos> Telling him where to find the cheat sheet, but Messner found it instead.
- Yes.<eos> We must find him, that's all that matters.<eos> You know the police man on Mateo's case?<eos> He came to see me.<eos> He asked me about Ange, our friend, Ange.<eos> You see, all these years I've felt bad, really bad, for not looking into it.<eos> Today, I want the truth.<eos> Tell me the truth.<eos> Everyone knows the truth.<eos> He was holding his gun, cleaning it and the shot went off.
What kind of superstition?<eos> Any one stemming from fear.<eos> Fear begot gods.<eos> One God in the end.<eos> You're one god ahead of us, monotheists.<eos> - lt's not about philosophy.<eos> - What is it about?<eos> Life.<eos> There's only one life.<eos> You mustn't waste it for the sake of some fantasy.
Why open old wounds?<eos> We have more serious problems now.<eos> More serious than the life of this man... ... whichyoutook,eventhough he had done no wrong?<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Everybody's guilty of something.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You're clearly biased.<eos> I object to your recording this interview.<eos> I remember enough to publish it.
"Facing an eternity without your soul mate, "you went off the deep end.<eos> "You turned into someone that you weren't, "a monster.<eos> "Alaric can restore your lost memories.<eos> "All you have to do is ask, "but I hope that you don't.<eos> "I tried it the other way.<eos> "I didn't see an end to the pain.<eos> "I want you to rediscover yourself "in the absence of the one who defined you.<eos> "If you feel any hope for the future at all, "then you're already better off.<eos> "You've been given a chance to start over.<eos> "I want you to take it.
Of course, that was her cruel trick...<eos> Hey guys?<eos> Best timing ever.<eos> Oh, decided to come back online, did we?<eos> - Talbot's here.<eos> - Talbot, Talbot?<eos> - What the hell's he doing there?<eos> All that matters is our cover's at risk, so I'm calling an audible.<eos> We're not gonna wait till later to get the painting.<eos> - We're gonna get it now.
This one could get messy.<eos> What is this place?<eos> This is the home of the first possession victim we could find on record.<eos> A young boy killed his mother and father here 35 years ago.<eos> The property never sold again.<eos> Who was he?<eos> Marcello Panneti.<eos> Nice bloke.<eos> Doesn't say much.<eos> Now, I can't release the soul from our world without its name, but I can bind it to one place so it can't go on killing.

Hundreds, actually. Oh.<eos> But you are the one I bought this dress for.<eos> This dress... costs more than my apartment.<eos> Yeah, it's couture.<eos> Which I'm pretty sure is French for expensive.<eos> So, dinner?<eos> Purely platonic.<eos> There is nothing platonic about couture.<eos> Ah, fine.<eos> I'll have my assistant return it.
Who is it?<eos> Joe Gravano, local mob boss, wanted for 39 counts of murder, racketeering, and drug smuggling.<eos> One of the most heavily protected men in Starling City.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> What's "N.P.P.?"<eos> I don't know.<eos> I can definitely find out.<eos> Where are we with the cell phone from her apartment?<eos> Crazy pants encrypted the SIM card.<eos> I can crack it, but it's going to take some time.
He was a magician.<eos> Magician's assistant, more accurately. He worked with a local act before getting cut loose.<eos> Mancini hasn't worked since.<eos> Culebra cartel, magician's assistant.<eos> What's the connection?<eos> Their act was at the Sansa bar.<eos> The Sansa bar's where's the drug dealer was murdered.<eos> You mean the person you beat to death?<eos> I told you-- whoever's doing this is leaving me a trail to follow.<eos> Then we follow it.
How could I know that?<eos> !<eos> A-Ana, the director, asked me to keep an eye on him... with a video camera.<eos> Why would she want you to do something like that?<eos> J-me was required to turn over a urine sample every day to prove he was clean and sober.<eos> Last night, he refused, so Ana thought a video of him buying drugs off the street would serve the same purpose.<eos> You can't touch that stuff, okay? !<eos> It's all personal!<eos> Okay, how did that video end up at Inside P.O.V.?<eos> I sold it to them to make a few extra bucks!
- was the same as the number of the room. - 319.<eos> Wait, you don't think that that crucifix and that gun could still be in that vent in 319 15 years later?<eos> We have to look, and we have to have another conversation.<eos> - With whom?<eos> - With whomever saw this and realized it wasn't just another improvisation.<eos> J-me wasn't killed because he argued with the director or had artistic differences.<eos> He was killed because he knew too much.<eos> Hey.<eos> Mm, Andy.<eos> Uh, Sykes is bringing J-me's driver into the electronics room, and, uh, the prints are ready, and the video's up in interview 2 so we can show it to that director lady.
Look...<eos> This whole thing's gotten way out of control.<eos> Okay driving to and from set every day,<eos> J-me talked about how he used to get high, and I would tell him stories of being strung out back in the day.<eos> He seemed genuinely interested in my life.<eos> - But he wasn't.<eos> - No.<eos> No, he just wanted my stories, then he kept pushing Ana with his whole... authenticity routine, you know?<eos> "Your story's real.<eos> Let's keep it real.
I'll be like, "take that, boy!" And then I'll bite him.<eos> Our new client's here.<eos> Dump the unwindable case on the associates.<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> I think this could be a tremendous opportunity for us.<eos> It's this poor, little farmer.<eos> He's being bullied by this giant bio-tech company.<eos> It's a real David-and-Goliath story.<eos> And you don't take a case because you can win.<eos> You take it because it's the right thing to do.
And final platform. Val's got it hooked.<eos> Val's got it hooked. Jeremy's got his hooked!<eos> It's val's first. It's val's first. It's jeremy's second.<eos> It's jeremy's second. Jeremy slips off.<eos> Jeremy slips off. Val's is still on. Val's is still on.<eos> Good job, val! Good job, val! Get back in there!<eos> Get back in there! Val needs to move!<eos> Val needs to move! Jeremy close to sending his wife Jeremy close to sending his wife to exile island.<eos> To exile island. Jeremy's hooked his second Jeremy's hooked his second platform.<eos> Can he get it back. Can he get it back.
Alwaysapig question. Question.<eos> Allright,itistime to vote.<eos> To vote.<eos> weallloveyou ,sweetheart.<eos> Just way too much experience on<eos> Just way too much experience on "amazing race."<eos> Votes. oh,mygod.<eos> oh,mygod.<eos> This is too intense.<eos> Hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be Want to play it, now would be the time to do so.
But when I processed the sticky gunk, it's actually... a smoke residue, specifically from a strain of cannabis sativa.<eos> Grass?<eos> Yeah. Grass.<eos> If you grew up in the '60s.<eos> Um, and our killer must've smoked a lot of it when they were building this thing.<eos> Yeah, we used to call that a "stoner."<eos> That term's actually still culturally relevant.<eos> How's it relevant to our case?<eos> If you can find our killer's stash,<eos> I can match it.
We'll photocopy them, just in case<eos> That envelope wasn't on Karlsson's list<eos> You're right<eos> She's asking for the documents... to distract us from this envelope<eos> I know what you're thinking, and we can't it's confidential, so we can't use it in the trial<eos> - There's no use opening it<eos> - It's already open<eos> You know that makes no difference.<eos> I don't want to compromise my case<eos> Look, Carole. I'm putting it back exactly where I found it
- Got any cash? - Yeah.<eos> Sure<eos> - ls 300 OK?<eos> - Yeah. Nice one<eos> - You never saw me<eos> - No worries Call me.<eos> OK?<eos> You've never met a man called Zach? How about Bensimon? No?<eos> OK. Here's your statement.<eos> Read it and sign
This is not good.<eos> It worked.<eos> Beautifully.<eos> You're fallen.<eos> I have to admit, I thought a ghoul Would deliver me the feather, but thank you, zed.<eos> Looks like my protection spell To keep evil out is keeping evil in.<eos> A fallen angel finds a desperate bloke, Intercepts him at the gates of hell And makes him think it's the gates of heaven.<eos> Zachary didn't take your feather.<eos> You put it in his hand so you could break through to earth.<eos> The ghouls were after the feather to bring it back to you?
But not too slow. Is that it?<eos> If my two associates don't return From Fell's with the acetate,<eos> I want to be able to come back And question you more... Aggressively.<eos> Oh... I always took you for a... A voodoo priest with a...<eos> A flair for the dramatic. But a cold-blooded killer?<eos> I do what's needed.<eos> But I don't need to darken my soul tonight.<eos> Not with the situation firmly in hand.<eos> A pharmaceutical dose of vitamin K.<eos> This will stop the bleeding... If you can get to it.
But I swear, Butch..., on my sainted mother's grave, some day soon I am going to kill that old man with my bare hands and my teeth!<eos> I'll be holding your shoes.<eos> I just wish that Penguin was still alive.<eos> I didn't make that little punk suffer near badly enough.<eos> Excuse me, sir?<eos> I couldn't help but notice the sign on your trailer.<eos> Is it still for rent?<eos> 100 bucks a week.<eos> It ain't much, but... - I'll take it.<eos> - You don't want to look at it first?
They've lied to you about everything.<eos> We have to get out of here now.<eos> Stokes!<eos> We have to go now!<eos> We have to go!<eos> How's she doing?<eos> She suffered intense trauma, and her brain may have forged some faulty pathways to avoid dealing with it.<eos> - She's been through a lot.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That video that was shown during Ostara, can you tracks the access code that was used to upload it.
So how's Ryan doing with all this?<eos> Uh, I haven't... I haven't talked to him yet.<eos> I know that I have to, and I'm...<eos> Here, no, you keep it.<eos> No, honey.<eos> Nah, look it, sweetheart, I'm gonna be there to see this child born, okay?<eos> I'm gonna hold him or her... In my arms.<eos> I promise.<eos> So you keep that picture.<eos> Okay. And you show it to Ryan.
Hmm, yeah. I'm sure it's safe.<eos> Well, your wife can take your stuff home with her, if that makes you feel better.<eos> Actually, I'm spending the night here.<eos> Well, I promise,<eos> Mr. Braverman, we'll take very good care of your things.<eos> I'm not putting my wedding ring in the closet.<eos> I'm not supposed to let you keep anything.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> They won't allow any jewelry into the operating room.<eos> I'll give it to one of the kids.

You want to know their names?<eos> Actually, it was probably just one.<eos> I need a name.<eos> Kalinda.<eos> Sharma.<eos> How is your hand?<eos> Although you are not explicitly forbidden alcohol, we would advise against any triggers for abuse.<eos> I understand.<eos> How are you handling your release, Mr. Agos?<eos> How am I handling it?
Okay. So I can use the first quote.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - 1 Corinthians.<eos> And he'll come back at me with 1 Samuel 16:7.<eos> What can I use?<eos> "I would not have known what sin was had it not been for the law."<eos> - Right, good. The law. - Yeah.<eos> Oh, and look at his translation.<eos> Um, I think it's American standard version.<eos> Compare it to, uh, the revised standard.
It's all replaceable.<eos> Let's just be glad you didn't get killed.<eos> Damn it.<eos> If I hadn't been asleep...<eos> What happened?<eos> Do you remember?<eos> I was sleeping, and then they broke the window, and they pulled me out of it, and...<eos> And I tried to hold on, but I got stuck in the door, and they dragged me for a while, and then they punched me, and then they kicked me, and...<eos> And then I couldn't hold on anymore.<eos> God, why didn't you just let them take it?
So did you.<eos> I patched up guys.<eos> I can no more, you know, re-jigger a hard drive...<eos> - Reformat.<eos> - What?<eos> Reformat a hard drive.<eos> You gave what you had to give.<eos> You served.<eos> And you deserve all the help and gratitude that's offered to you.<eos> But if you think that by accepting this help you're taking it away from the next guy, you are wrong.
You don't know exactly what you're about to face.<eos> I have a brain tumor.<eos> It's inoperable.<eos> I thought I had longer, but it's growing.<eos> Soon, I will show symptoms, and after that, I will die.<eos> Who knows about this?<eos> Hunt?<eos> Uh, anyone?<eos> Fetal surgery is a new field.<eos> The few of us who are practicing it are basically inventing it as we go along.
Either that or, Martin, can your car fit two?<eos> Post-divorce, I had a rebound fling with a 16-stone lady trucker called Fat Pat.<eos> Romancing a woman of that size in the back of the flame-red Tigo could prove taxing.<eos> Getting her bra and truss off alone was a three-man job.<eos> Luckily she had a friend - Mick, her husband.<eos> Dark days!<eos> I'll probably just rent.<eos> Dad!<eos> About your car...<eos> Before you see it, can you just remember that I was really, really angry.
Working on what?<eos> - Uh, nothing.<eos> N-Never mind.<eos> - N-No.<eos> - (Shaw) That's weird.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> (Finch) Indeed.<eos> What's he doing now?<eos> Well, it looks like he's trying to repair a cell phone.<eos> He just took the SIM card and put it in a new burner.
We study a body and form a diagnosis.<eos> Look, do you see the way the blood spatter landed?<eos> Well, that means he split her artery first.<eos> And there's a post-mortem bruise in the shape of the killer's hand on her neck.<eos> The hand is bigger than average, which means the killer is likely to be of a larger stature.<eos> I mean, this room is littered with medical clues.<eos> If you give me time to decipher them, I'm sure I can paint a more conclusive portrait of your killer.<eos> Okay. See what you can find.<eos> So, Mary's roommate gave us a copy of her client list.<eos> We're going through it now.
I apologize.<eos> It's a recent development.<eos> Abe sort of absconded with this ledger.<eos> Problem is, the customers are written in some sort of code.<eos> You're saying he stole it?<eos> "Borrowed."<eos> The antique weaponry game is a cutthroat business.<eos> But I'm sure I can crack the code, given enough time.<eos> If Devin Bentley's name is in here, that's all the evidence we need to arrest him.<eos> Yeah, until the court finds out that you obtained this evidence illegally, and they throw it out...
I ain't getting any more alive.<eos> Down the hall, second door on the left.<eos> Now.<eos> I really needed this.<eos> I never don't need it.<eos> We really should go get my daughter, though.<eos> I'm kinky, but not that kinky.<eos> I meant after we were done.<eos> Oh, okay. That'll be very soon.<eos> Shut the door and lock it.
Every 55 seconds, a toddler chokes on a grape.<eos> Mom, I am a grown man.<eos> You got to stop trying to take care of me.<eos> I'm sorry, I just didn't want you to oversleep.<eos> Won't happen again.<eos> If you find a complete, balanced breakfast downstairs, just know it was made before we had this talk.<eos> Mom...<eos> Yes?<eos> You already started singing the song.<eos> You don't finish it, it's gonna be stuck in my head all day.
Do whatever you think is right.<eos> I ended my treatment the day before Deb and I got on the boat.<eos> There's nothing more they can do.<eos> I'm feeling pretty good right now, but... in a month or so, I'm going to take a turn for the worse.<eos> All I really want to do is spend whatever time I have left making your aunt the happiest woman in the world.<eos> We're getting married tomorrow, but I know it wouldn't feel right to her unless you were there.<eos> Appreciate you hearing me out.<eos> I really want to know what's in the box.<eos> If it's a murder weapon,<eos> I-I got to give it to the New York D.A. right away.

Well, I-I don't think your battle's gonna be with the insurance company.<eos> I think it's gonna be with these two boys.<eos> I think he's right.<eos> These boys have got too much honor to take something that's not rightfully theirs.<eos> Travis, I misjudged you.<eos> I'm really sorry about that.<eos> And we're both deeply sorry for your loss, both of you.<eos> So... what are you gonna do with that thing?<eos> You know what?<eos> I think I'm gonna put it in a locker for a couple of months and... accidentally forget about it and then I'm gonna give it to the New York D.A.
Did you hire me to find Caitlin so you could kill her?<eos> - No!<eos> - Or have her killed?<eos> No, Liv.<eos> I swear!<eos> Those detectives outside that door?<eos> They're going to find out about you and the boyfriend.<eos> That's motive.<eos> And if my people can find that video...<eos> You can destroy it.
But nobody actually does that, right?<eos> People who think they need vitamins...<eos> - They're lazy. - Okay.<eos> I'll cross you off the list.<eos> Thank you, ma'am.<eos> - That's for everybody.<eos> - Oh, don't worry.<eos> I'll return it.<eos> You know, I absolutely love your outfit.<eos> Yeah, well, you got to go to Boston to get it...
But first, I need to talk to you about your family's trouble...<eos> The one that sews up people's eyes and mouths.<eos> Your daughter Colette, she told me that you might be able to help me figure out what triggered this.<eos> Lettie has a wonderful imagination.<eos> When she was six, she used the rose garden on our east knoll to build an entire make-believe city.<eos> Homes, schools, roads, a dance studio.<eos> Mr. Barrow, The Troubles are activated by an emotional state.<eos> Was anything happening back then?<eos> Her village even included a-a river.<eos> She used the garden hose to make it.
(music playing, people conversing) Welcome, Smiths.<eos> Come in.<eos> Where am I?<eos> This music.<eos> The mind-blowing furniture.<eos> The spectacular people who look like they all must have passports.<eos> Champagne?<eos> Check it out-- two chicks dancing.<eos> ROGER: They're making a statement.<eos> I don't understand it, but I want to so bad!
I don't understand it, but I want to so bad!<eos> O-M-triple-G!<eos> Is that Liev Schreiber?<eos> !<eos> Yeah, the Tesla's completely reversed my carbon footprint.<eos> Every time I start the car, I'm giving back to the Earth.<eos> That's both environmentally friendly and you're Liev Schreiber!<eos> It's incredible!<eos> As is that scarf.<eos> But tell me, Liev Schreiber, why are you still wearing it inside?
That was when I thought a recliner was the height of aspiration.<eos> It's all so clear to me now.<eos> I'm Frasier and you're Frasier's dad.<eos> That's not true.<eos> That was weird, but well timed.<eos> Anyway, this is not my fault, it's yours!<eos> If I hadn't wasted all these years with you ill-mannered monsters, I would've known better than to give a Spider-Man backpack as a gift!<eos> You guys have dragged me down to your level!<eos> I broke the door!<eos> (door slams) Fixed it!
- Put the box down now.<eos> Officer, this is my brother.<eos> It's OK...<eos> It's just a misunderstanding.<eos> Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> Jesse, just gonna have to put the box down, mate, OK?<eos> No!<eos> I don't wanna put my hands on my head!<eos> I know.<eos> OK, they'll stop shouting at you if you put it on the ground.
What?<eos> It's technology.<eos> The thing with the satchels doesn't make any sense.<eos> It's on a USB stick.<eos> They could just email it.<eos> Satchels don't make sense.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I haven't a background in trading nuclear secrets.<eos> Maybe there is a reason.<eos> Or just put in a briefcase and take it on a plane.
The guy was a ghost.<eos> What?<eos> A couple of days before my dad was killed, he called Paul Clayton's daughter, and told her he might have a new lead.<eos> Maybe he finally tracked him down.<eos> Do me a favor-- go to my house, go through my dad's stuff-- tapes, journals.<eos> See if you can find anything on Burrows.<eos> In the meantime, I'm gonna call the property clerk at HPD and have them pull up all the evidence.<eos> You want to reopen this case?<eos> Obviously this meant a lot to my dad.<eos> I owe it to him to try to solve it.
Yeah, Chin?<eos> What do you got?<eos> Looks like you were right about that lead.<eos> What? My dad was closing in on Ned Burrows.<eos> Yup.<eos> Turns out that shortly before your father passed,<eos> Hawaii launched a program to issue state I.D.'s to the homeless, so they could apply for jobs and services.<eos> Your dad checked and found out Burrows got one of those I.D.'s, which put him in the system.<eos> And once that happened, he started leaving a trail.<eos> Right, but my father never got the chance to follow it.
Thank God I fixed that in time.<eos> He hadn't.<eos> Zelda's song had already been listened to by 11 Wallflower employees, including Silent Arnold, who secretly ripped every song...<eos> Minus the Kate Hudson album.<eos> Silent Arnold shares his library with the entire office park, which is how it was heard by...<eos> Cool song, Zelda.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> Hey. There's the rock star.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Somebody must have yanked it from my computer...
What if I've wasted my life?<eos> Hey, you know what would make you feel better?<eos> How about we get some Sushi from that place across the street?<eos> That won't fill the empty void in me.<eos> Might for a few hours.<eos> People think I'm good.<eos> They're sharing my music.<eos> What if I missed out on my true calling in life?<eos> Come on. Don't beat yourself up.<eos> It's not like there was some specific moment where you had a clear chance and then you threw it away.
True, but we managed to access the mainframe.<eos> The original coding that was sent to the host came from an IP address in Silver Spring, Maryland.<eos> Meet our sinister Web master.<eos> Dorian Hobart.<eos> After his dishonorable discharge from the Army in 2007, Hobart became involved in several antigovernment extremist groups.<eos> He hops from one broadband to the other every time he logs on.<eos> Now, we know who he is;<eos> we just don't know where.<eos> The site has a message board, right?<eos> Let's use it.
Uh, Top Secret, uh...<eos> So people in my levels of access for systems administration or as a... a infrastructure analyst, typically have, uh, higher accesses than an NSA employee would normally have.<eos> Normal NSA employees have a combination of clearances called TS, SI, TK, and Gamma.<eos> Um, that's Top Secret, uh, Signals Intelligence, Talent Keyhole, and Gamma.<eos> And they all, uh, relate to certain things that are sort of core to the NSA mission.<eos> As a systems administrator, you get a special clearance called PRIVAC, for Privileged Access, which allows you to be exposed to information of any classification, regardless of what your position actually needs.<eos> Just before we go, a reminder of our top story, that's that the former CIA technical worker<eos> Edward Snowden says he's responsible for leaking information that US authorities had been monitoring phone and Internet data.<eos> The US Justice Department confirmed it's in the first stages of a criminal investigation.<eos> Leave it longer or cut it shorter, what do you think?
Just remember, kids, in five years' time, when you leave university, there will nothing holding you back.<eos> Except for a mountain of unpayable lifelong crippling debt.<eos> So be ambitious, children!<eos> Remember, the sky's the limit.<eos> How do you spell celebrity?<eos> - Oi, Stephen, can I borrow a gel pen?<eos> - What scent, cherry or lime?<eos> Whatever.<eos> Oh, oh, it's a mouse!<eos> Somebody kill it. Somebody get it for me!
No. No one's killing anyone.<eos> It's just... neutralize her powers.<eos> Maybe.<eos> - Can you read this?<eos> - Elvish? No, I didn't even see "Lord of The Rings."<eos> Never mind.<eos> Belle translated it.<eos> It tells us how to enact the spell.<eos> "With both hands, hold the candle and then use your magic to light it.<eos> And then when you blow on it..."
I just wanted to say thanks for letting me pitch in.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> We couldn't have done this without you.<eos> Yeah, Oren and Kent are alive because of your help.<eos> Well, it's always good to get a win.<eos> - Well, see ya around.<eos> - See ya around.<eos> See ya.<eos> You know, there used to be some finality to all of this.<eos> You took a photo, dump it in the box, and you never see that face again.
Somebody needs a favor.<eos> - Charlotte, where are you?<eos> My kids--what have you done with them?<eos> - They're okay.<eos> Jody, it's me.<eos> I'm here to help you.<eos> Charlotte told me About you losing your job and gavin leaving.<eos> - Don't--don't talk about gavin.<eos> - What happened to your sister wasn't your fault.<eos> You can't control your trouble, but just coming here at night, You're already starting to manage it.
- We should enjoy the time we have left.<eos> It might not last.<eos> - So you want to get stabbed in the crotch.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - You can treat me like audrey, But you can't make me act like her.<eos> - Shh. - Have you ever considered an inflatable doll?<eos> - You know that blue dress, the one from your birthday?<eos> I wish you'd wear it more often.
No, he's still processing Hawkins' garage.<eos> Can't believe he volunteered to do that.<eos> Yeah, he said he needed some alone time to think about cat issues.<eos> Yeah, like that's not weird.<eos> Okay, so we will count Tony out.<eos> You want to give the stats on Hawkins, and then I'll chime in?<eos> What, are you writing a script for the update?<eos> I just want to be prepared.<eos> Getting an 82 on my eval,<eos> I feel like I need to keep earning it.
The really odd part is that the...<eos> The clay is 700 years old.<eos> The soil found under the nails of Carrie Ann Beck dates back to the 14th century.<eos> It's called Raw Sienna.<eos> - Okay, so, what's it doing there?<eos> - Raw Sienna was used by painters at the time, painters who belonged to what's known as the Sienese School.<eos> The Prado in Madrid has an exhibit going on right now featuring paintings from the Sienese School.<eos> Last week, one of those paintings was stolen.<eos> That's what she and Beck were fighting over, this painting.<eos> Maybe they were trying to sell it on the black market, fund their operation.
If the Apophis Strain is out there...<eos> You didn't tell this to the FBI?<eos> Lillian is paid to embargo certain key details from your colleagues if she believes they may be of interest to me.<eos> You sure she can be trusted?<eos> - I could say the same thing about you.<eos> - Ladies, please.<eos> I'm surprised the two of you haven't met at a conference or company retreat.<eos> Does the FBI do a Christmas party?<eos> One of the priests sent to guard the strain got sick.<eos> And to protect it, the dying man swallowed it whole, taking it to his grave.
Like I said...<eos> For fun.<eos> Well, can I least get a name, rank, and serial number...<eos> Who you are, what you are, where you're from?<eos> That's what I figured.<eos> It's okay, though, 'cause your mission's over.<eos> And there's nothing that you can do about that.<eos> Only question now is, how long do you live?<eos> That revenge that Mitchell desires?<eos> The entire Guard shares it...
I don't.<eos> But I have run out of ways to get people to pay attention.<eos> Do this, and the world will listen.<eos> They'll examine my life, my research.<eos> That can't happen unless you pull the trigger.<eos> Medic! I need a medic!<eos> Take it easy, pal.<eos> Creel, listen to me.<eos> You have to understand.<eos> If I have a shot, I'm gonna take it.
We need to figure out its end game.<eos> How?<eos> It's playing 20 moves ahead.<eos> It operates based on rules.<eos> Rules that we can't even grasp.<eos> We understand the machine.<eos> We can understand Samaritan.<eos> We don't understand the machine at all.<eos> Out of 43 versions, how many do you think there were that didn't try to either trick or kill me?<eos> One, and I could only bring it to heel by crippling it.
Oh, hey, um, sorry it's so late.<eos> Alex texted me and told me to come over after the show.<eos> But my phone died, and...<eos> Yeah, he's asleep.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Of course.<eos> Um, okay, well,<eos> I brought you guys, like, this really shitty bottle of rosé.<eos> Uh, as a congratulations.<eos> Here, you should keep it.
Okay. I'm a ten, you're a four.<eos> This one's our new chocolate white chocolate, and for every dozen we sell, we donate 50 cents to Operation Smile.<eos> Yeah, nobody's listening to you.<eos> They're all watching Sugar write frosting swears on her jugs.<eos> She just wrote "vagina" on her boobs.<eos> That doesn't even make any sense.<eos> She's doing what?<eos> I told her ten minutes ago to put another batch of oatmeal in the oven.<eos> Oh, that dough is gone, Lois.<eos> I warmed it up and put it behind those waist-high holes in the wall.
Of course.<eos> I'll be near, if you need me.<eos> If you're trying to hide from me, Ms. Swan, you're doing a poor job.<eos> I'm not hiding from you.<eos> I'm hiding from everyone else.<eos> Ah. So Belle tells me.<eos> She was watching Neal all night.<eos> While my family was searching for me, I know.<eos> My magic is hurting people, gold... people I love.<eos> I need you to help me control it.
Well, I'm sorry if I don't respond to your every summons!<eos> Though I did bring that locator potion you wanted.<eos> Maybe next time, try leading with, "thank you."<eos> Now, may I see my son, please?<eos> You might want to finish buttoning your shirt first.<eos> Oh.<eos> Well, I was in a rush to get here.<eos> A locator potion.<eos> How does this work, exactly?<eos> We just pour it over anything that belonged to Emma... something...
Faith.<eos> You hear anything about that?<eos> Maybe.<eos> She had something we needed...<eos> A key to a locker.<eos> Your daughter gave it to her, but I couldn't find it.<eos> The night Caitlin was killed, she was at your office.<eos> She took something, a folder.<eos> Faith took that locker key from Caitlin.<eos> She was dead as soon as she took it.
He was looking for a key to a locker.<eos> I think that's where Caitlin stashed the folder.<eos> So, you're saying Caitlin gave faith the key before she went to the hotel.<eos> Yes, exactly.<eos> Well, where's the key?<eos> Um, somewhere in Washington?<eos> Kubiak can't find it, either.<eos> He's looked everywhere.<eos> I've been racking my brain, and I'm in the same boat.<eos> I have no idea where Faith could have put it.
Of course.<eos> They're framing me like their lackey.<eos> Frustrating thing is, I had him.<eos> Who?<eos> Ortiz, my classmate.<eos> He's the mole.<eos> You sure it's Ortiz?<eos> My gun at the crime scene?<eos> It's not a coincidence.<eos> He offered to clean it for me.
No.<eos> I want to hear how sleeping with the boyfriend of your best friend in the entire world. Is not as bad as it sounds.<eos> But when you're done, if I'm not convinced, you have to transfer schools, because I never want to see your (bleep) face ever again.<eos> You have 60 seconds.<eos> You're on.<eos> Just to be clear, I'm not interested in Liam.<eos> I only slept with him because I wanted to hurt you in the worst way possible.<eos> Not a great opening.<eos> Hope you're not representing yourself in court.<eos> (Sighs) Remember when you saved up all your money to buy that cinderella dress and you kept it in my room.

Yo, hottie.<eos> Up top!<eos> We had a deal, remember?<eos> You get out in time or I walk.<eos> So now this happens.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Sorry, Romeo.<eos> Think we just broke up.<eos> NYPD just found your getaway car by the East River.<eos> Hope they can't trace it back to you.
Tablet in every home, and a camera pointed at the face of every child, while Samaritan controls everything they see, learn, think.<eos> Speak of the devil.<eos> Something just started hacking my phone.<eos> Samaritan.<eos> It's coming through Wilkins' computer!<eos> Get out of there now!<eos> Veronique, I'm off the phone.<eos> How are you and Sebastian getting--<eos> Pretty.<eos> Take the gun out of your purse and put it in my hand.
- I have bigger problems.<eos> I haven't even told you what mine is yet.<eos> I benched Manny.<eos> I'm worried Jay and Gloria are mad at me.<eos> - Have they said anything?<eos> - No.<eos> All I've gotten from them so far is "hola"<eos> and "that scotch is not for company."<eos> Oh, my gosh, Phil, is that the wedding video?<eos> Oh, we are so excited to see it.
Said it from day 1.<eos> Only thing coordinated about this kid was his outfits.<eos> The way you call me your perfect little angel boy and stuff,<eos> I just feel like I'm letting you down.<eos> Ay, Manny, I'm so sorry.<eos> You could never let me down, because you're my per...<eos> You're okay.<eos> I cued up the wedding video.<eos> Oh! All by yourself?<eos> Let's watch it.
Actually, we interviewed that woman.<eos> She said she didn't record anything.<eos> She was on a speakerphone, having a conversation.<eos> Or maybe not.<eos> You know, we chose that neighborhood for the pilot program because it had the highest rate of civilian complaints in the city.<eos> We're not very popular up there.<eos> So what do we do?<eos> Offer her something.<eos> Some kind of reward.<eos> Get a subpoena, seize it as evidence and dump her phone.
It's me. I can't believe I'm talking to you.<eos> - Morgan, it's been so long, I-I thought you were dead.<eos> - So did I. But listen, none of that matters now.<eos> - Does--does this mean I did this to you?<eos> - It's okay, honey.<eos> We can fix this. Audrey and nathan are here, and we've figured out a way.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Okay. Yeah, what is it?<eos> I'll do anything.<eos> - Just take a photo of yourself and then print it out.
I'm sorry to hear it.<eos> France is starving, and surely we all feel a duty to help make the suffering end.<eos> Can you give me a date, a specific date, when I can expect the first shipment?<eos> Soon, Your Majesty.<eos> Very soon.<eos> How dare he?<eos> He calls men lazy while they starve?<eos> While they grieve?<eos> Take his land and be done with it.<eos> And in taking it, I would anger every French nobleman two days before they gather here to help put the crown on my head.
Recess is almost over!<eos> gals}. Go ahead.<eos> my God. }You guys are so cisgender.<eos> but you can {\*just }suck my clit and my balls.<eos> and all you're doing is}... you guys.<eos> You know what?<eos> That's what!<eos> Suck my clit and balls.<eos> I believe we have a solution to this little problem.<eos> The cisgenders have the problem. we are going to clear out the janitor's closet and remodel it... into a private bathroom just for you!
So, the government did this?<eos> The government, Soviet super-spies, aliens.<eos> There's a sweet old lady in Tulsa who thinks that Elvis did it.<eos> All I know is that it wasn't me.<eos> And with your help, I can prove it.<eos> How?<eos> The bullet.<eos> It's still in Cooper's head.<eos> We asked for it during the trial so they could see that it did not come from my gun.<eos> They wouldn't give it to me.
The diary they found in his apartment said he wanted to see his own name in lights.<eos> To impress a girl that he had a crush on.<eos> Carnahan claimed the diary was forged...<eos> An obvious defense...<eos> But then you go online, and you realize there are several handwriting experts out there who have admitted it's possible.<eos> And he had been mugged twice that summer, meaning he had good reason to carry a gun.<eos> Wait, are you two telling me...<eos> That there could have been a second shooter on the grassy knoll? Yeah.<eos> He might actually be innocent.<eos> But the only way to prove it is to get that bullet, and the only way to get that bullet... Is to remove it from President Cooper's skull.
That phrase is past tense.<eos> The wording feels...<eos> - Firsthand.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I think Bakshi slipped.<eos> Maybe Whitehall and Red Skull have some sort of connection.<eos> Sounds logical, other than the fact that Red Skull's been dead for over 70 years.<eos> Which is right around the time the SSR recovered the Obelisk.<eos> Clearly, whatever Red Skull did to get the Obelisk influenced Whitehall.<eos> This used to be an SSR base before Fury restored it.
- and suddenly, you lay him out.<eos> - You think I would do that?<eos> I can't argue a man to suicide.<eos> Clearly, you've never been in an argument with yourself, then.<eos> You had him right where you wanted him!<eos> What is it you want to know, huh?<eos> I'll tell you...<eos> Doesn't matter what I ask.<eos> I can't trust the answer.<eos> Write that sentence down, hand it to your therapist.
As much as I'd like to believe it was my magical personality,<eos> I think you have something up and running and need allies.<eos> And know that I'll have your back, whatever it is.<eos> Will you never trust me?<eos> But I'll never stop wanting to.<eos> It's been running for a few hours. 26 satellites scouring the world for your map.<eos> Good.<eos> Multispectral images, ground-penetrating radar.<eos> Now we wait for the ding that says we have a match.<eos> If there's evidence of this city on Earth, the computer will find it.
No further questions, Your Honor.<eos> - I got this. - N... Let's call a recess.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Ms. Boykin, do you still work for... Azo Charter?<eos> No, I don't. So, you were...<eos> I was...?<eos> You...<eos> Do you have a question, Ms. Tascioni?<eos> Do I? Yes, I do.<eos> Do you want to ask it?
Hey. Cece, Jess needs some help<eos> - with some lady stuff.<eos> - Of course.<eos> You know how we do.<eos> Gonna...<eos> - Must be a rough one.<eos> - You know what,<eos> I'm gonna have a look around.<eos> You know what, you should start with Nick and I's room.<eos> We share it.
Just order something else.<eos> Mitchell, it's game day.<eos> I can't. It's my lucky meal.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Well, that's attractive.<eos> You look like a puppy with a slipper.<eos> Under my leadership, the varsity football team is now 5-0 -- new school record, very exciting.<eos> Cam, I can smell your hat from over here.<eos> Can I please just pop it in the laundry?
I can't. It's my lucky meal.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Well, that's attractive.<eos> You look like a puppy with a slipper.<eos> Under my leadership, the varsity football team is now 5-0 -- new school record, very exciting.<eos> Cam, I can smell your hat from over here.<eos> Can I please just pop it in the laundry?<eos> And wash the luck off?<eos> I've worn it to every game.
PT repeated.<eos> It's got to be initials.<eos> Peyton Temple.<eos> Peyton Temple was a name found on Reid's phone records.<eos> Well, if he wrote this, I'd like to ask him what he was using the equation to optimize.<eos> You... you'd like to ask him?<eos> This could be the killer.<eos> This could be anyone.<eos> How's your handle on Frame Invocation Theory?<eos> Because he used it in this equationC#, and it might be helpful to understand it fully.
No.<eos> He needs to take accountability.<eos> Moving on.<eos> So... nothing on Tina's cell phone? No.<eos> No threatening voice mails or text messages and every outside call came from a disposable.<eos> Well, Little G did say this nutjob preferred to scare her in public. Yeah.<eos> Stalking with a personal touch.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> He knows Jamie from the business card.<eos> Then he would have to touch it or put his hands on it to read the name, right?
All due respect, Sergeant.<eos> I asked you the question.<eos> Detective Reagan's situation.<eos> And my part in its, um... origins.<eos> That sound right?<eos> I was asking the sergeant, sir, if his management style might've given the men and women under his command reason to suppose that showing results outweighed proper procedure in obtaining those results.<eos> Men and women or one man?<eos> I was using Detective Reagan as an example, sir.<eos> I forgot the question, sir.<eos> Do you need me to repeat it for you?
I thought we were going to give a chicken the best day of its life.<eos> I hate that we keep rescheduling that, but being a realtor man means working on Sundays, like priests and Lesley Stahl.<eos> Good luck out there, honey.<eos> We're all counting on you.<eos> Just got to make it through this commute.<eos> I'll call when I get there.<eos> I'm there!<eos> Have a great day!<eos> I am handling the sale of our neighbor Jerry's house.<eos> He's selling it and moving into a bachelor pad now that he's officially divorced.
I'm cutting carbs.<eos> So, did you, uh, get a chance to look over that offer?<eos> Yeah, it's great.<eos> I can finally move into a better place, maybe get that colonoscopy my doctor's been pushing for.<eos> What if I told you there's an even better offer coming?<eos> There is?<eos> There sure might be!<eos> Tomorrow, someone could show up and offer way more.<eos> But, Phil, this is above asking.<eos> Why don't you want me to take it?
Well, I'd love to talk specifics, but that information's classified.<eos> Is there anything you could offer us?<eos> Darby and Rebecca spent much of the past year on-site with a private defense contractor.<eos> Uh, Axelrod Industries.<eos> If there were issues, they'd be someone you should talk to.<eos> One other question.<eos> Did you get a sense that Commander Wilson and Ms. Ortega's relationship extended beyond work?<eos> Um, excuse me.<eos> The admiral's requesting your signature.<eos> Darby and Rebecca were close, but... given our strict disclosure policies, they'd have to come to us with a relationship. Or keep it an office secret.
!<eos> Yep.<eos> Conversation wasn't very fruitful, but it did give me time to put together my grocery list.<eos> Need anything?<eos> You can go home now.<eos> It's over?<eos> Nothing else to worry about.<eos> I got to say, though, protective custody has its advantages.<eos> Company wasn't half bad.<eos> Oh. I thought you might like to have it.
Yeah.<eos> Cars can be stubborn.<eos> That ain't the only thing.<eos> I've been thinking why you haven't fixed the car yet.<eos> What'd you come up with?<eos> Well, if the car doesn't work, Linda's gonna keep calling.<eos> Keeps her in your life.<eos> Once it's fixed, less reason to call.<eos> Not going to Linda.<eos> I'm selling it.
What does this mean?<eos> It means that even with you here, we can't protect everyone.<eos> So what do we do now?<eos> Prepare for the worst.<eos> You'll be safe in here.<eos> So you... you can keep the spell out?<eos> No, but we must be separated.<eos> As dark one, I may be immune to the spell, but you can still hurt me.<eos> Go inside and stay in the back room.<eos> I'm gonna seal it with a protection spell so no one can get to you.
Secondly, my bisque had a tooth in it.<eos> - It was a shell.<eos> - There was a filling in it.<eos> Ugh, I don't feel like waffles.<eos> Can you make me cereal?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Absolutely not.<eos> Absolutely not, Lily.<eos> You are gonna finish that waffle, or you're not gonna have breakfast.<eos> Can I at least eat it in front of the TV?
You see?<eos> As much as you want me to yell, I have a more effective method.<eos> When you say to a child,<eos> "I will treat you with dignity and respect,"<eos> that child will, in turn, say to you --<eos> I left the tag on.<eos> This is going back Monday.<eos> Oh, and right in the middle of getting up on such a high, high horse.<eos> - Okay, Lily.<eos> - You said put it on.
The cranberry sauce is okay, and the gravy is out of the woods.<eos> And, thanks to you, those baby carrots are gonna pull through.<eos> Well, they're fighters.<eos> And now, Phillip, for the last time, lightly brush the thighs.<eos> I'm gonna miss this Randy little redcoat.<eos> But it's time to cross the finish line.<eos> - No!<eos> - What?<eos> !<eos> Cranking up the heat must have dried it up and shrunk it!
Use your words.<eos> What do you need?<eos> - Where's Tyler's case file? - Wh-<eos> Good lord.<eos> How do you find anything?<eos> Here. Here.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Alicorn International. Tyler's father mentioned that he donated to charities that he'd never even heard of.<eos> Well, here's the list.<eos> I was looking at it the other day.
When I came home with this, he told me the story.<eos> I always knew he was weak.<eos> Pathetic.<eos> Finally understood why.<eos> What did you do to your father?<eos> He'swherehe belongs.<eos> Aaron,whatdidyou do?<eos> Myfatherwassmart.<eos> He could've done something with his life.<eos> Before they ruined it.
- You must not delay. hasten, go!<eos> - aren't you coming?<eos> - I must stay!<eos> - Stay!<eos> - Go quickly!<eos> - No!<eos> - Woe if you wait!<eos> - No!<eos> - Your life...<eos> - I care nothing for it.
I picked Edwin Borstein as a target.<eos> I went to the same Web sites he did, figured out who he was corresponding with, and then I wrote the virus, posed as a maid, and had it mailed to Borstein.<eos> You have zero programming experience whatsoever.<eos> You really asking me to believe that you taught yourself to write a computer virus that eats itself?<eos> If I give you a piece of paper right now could you write a little program for us?<eos> Erinwas a conscientious student.<eos> I know she took my work very seriously.<eos> But I would never advocate harming somebody.<eos> We're executing a search warrant on your computer, as we speak.<eos> If there's any trace of that virus on there, we'll find it.
Hiding, and panicking, and playing candy crush-- a lot of candy crush.<eos> I should've told you sooner. Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You know, you can yell at me.<eos> In fact, it would probably help if you did.<eos> I don't want to yell at you.<eos> I just don't want you hiding from me.<eos> I'm just going round and round, thinking about if I lose the luncheonette then I have no income.<eos> If I have no income, we have to sell the house.<eos> I'm gonna literally lose the roof over our kids' heads, and then, we're gonna have to sell it and move to some other district, and Jabbar's gonna have to make all new friends, and the whole thing's on me--
Hey, Amber.<eos> Brought you some herbal tea-- little peace offering.<eos> It's decaf.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, we're really sorry that you overheard us talking about you.<eos> We just don't want you to worry about the business stuff.<eos> That's our job.<eos> But that's, like, exactly my point-- is that it's my job too.<eos> I'm a big part of this company.<eos> You know, I asked you for a raise because I think I deserve it, not because I'm, like, pregnant or your niece.
Look, I came to you because, of all the family, you're the most evil and conniving.<eos> Ooh! Flattery!<eos> I'll give you 20 extra seconds.<eos> Wait.<eos> Why were you even near dad's lawn mower?<eos> [Sighs] I was gonna impress Cindy by driving it past her house.<eos> There's a lot of issues to deal with in that statement, but first let's deal with the lawn mower, then we'll circle back to your lack of game.<eos> Go on.<eos> Well, the lawn mower wouldn't start, so I opened the lid thing, smacked it with my fist like dad does, but when I did, I smacked the key out of my hand and down into the engine.<eos> I could see it, so I poked around to see if I could fish it out, but I think I might have made things worse.
And that's just to work my candy cane helicopter.<eos> Sophie's been so busy with the Polish Society Decorating Contest.<eos> We haven't had sex in days.<eos> Well, I got to beat my nemesis, Felka Bobenski.<eos> She wins every year.<eos> She's like the Modern Family of Christmas decorations<eos> You know who's having a blue Christmas this year?<eos> My balls.<eos> I love this city at the holidays.<eos> Yeah, the urine's all frozen so you can't really smell it.
- Yeah. So you're getting married in a fortnight - tell me about that.<eos> Well, um, what do you want to know?<eos> You see, for me, the fact that half the entire planet is made up of women - four billion of them.<eos> Literally millions of them, really, really smoking hot.<eos> I mean, when do you decide to draw the line?<eos> Well, you don't decide, you just...<eos> In my case, it was a beautiful evening.<eos> We'd had some wine and I was squatting, tying my shoelaces and she said, "Stay there, Angus, and ask me the question".<eos> And it turned out she had a ring!<eos> I've reimbursed her for it, of course.
- .All right, Gilou?<eos> - How's it going?<eos> I've heard the Ford is nearly ready Yeah.<eos> We just need to replace the wing Sod the wing.<eos> We've got crooks to catch No.<eos> I can't leave it in that state I can wait while you change it<eos> You'll have a long wait.<eos> It's still in the post<eos> - Is that its little sister?<eos> - Yeah Take the wing off that and stick it on here. Job done
You should come work for me.<eos> Never thought I'd be in real estate.<eos> You think I can handle it?<eos> Every other divorced mom at my kid's school is a realtor.<eos> I think you can handle it.<eos> Bonnie, I still don't get why you want to see this house.<eos> The foundation is totally out of whack.<eos> I mean, the-the whole house is slanting down to that cliff over there.<eos> Uh-huh. Can you open the sliding door?<eos> I'll take it.
RADIO PRESENTER: 'This is BBC Radio 5 Live.<eos> 'Slovenian authorities are investigating a break-in 'at a secure chemical facility in Kocevje.<eos> 'The facility is allegedly 'behind the development of a new nerve agent, 'which sources claim, if released into the atmosphere, 'could kill thousands of people per milligram.'<eos> Bob, have you got a phone I can borrow?<eos> 'A company spokesman would not confirm 'whether anything was taken in the break-in.<eos> 'The security services are playing down fears 'of terrorist involvement.'<eos> How long will we have to wait?<eos> Not long now.<eos> I can't believe we're in Bracknell.<eos> Never thought I'd be so happy to see it.

- Or more importantly, the temple inside.<eos> Mr. Ward here is something of an expert on S.H.I.E.L.D., and you an expert on the Diviner.<eos> Together, I think there's much we can achieve.<eos> You know you've lied to me.<eos> This happens every time...<eos> we get closer, you get nervous.<eos> Everything we've been doing leads here.<eos> Our job...<eos> find it before anyone else.<eos> If there's evidence of this city on Earth, the computer will find it.
- on where we're digging.<eos> - Ooh. Hats.<eos> Wish I was a hat guy.<eos> Some guys can really pull that look off, you know?<eos> - What?<eos> Too small?<eos> - You know, for a guy who's about to blow up a chunk of an underground city,<eos> - you don't seem fazed.<eos> - You have concerns?<eos> Just want to make sure that we're here to destroy that weapon, not recover it.
Now you're back with HYDRA?<eos> Pick a side, Ward.<eos> Oh, I have.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Let's go.<eos> With pleasure.<eos> You, too.<eos> What?<eos> I made you a promise, Skye.<eos> I'm here to keep it.
I hear that you're a surgeon?<eos> Cardiothoracic.<eos> But retired.<eos> No shop talk, dear.<eos> The only talk I want is to hear the story.<eos> What story?<eos> The proposal, of course.<eos> LANIE: Oh! That story!<eos> Yes, the story. Um... Well, we, um...<eos> You know, baby, you tell it so much better than me.
- Where'd they escape from?<eos> - Camp 14.<eos> - Then why are you brining them through here?<eos> Camp 14's back the other way.<eos> - You think we don't know where camp 14 is?<eos> Kuvira wants them transferred.<eos> - Then I'll need to see the transfer order.<eos> - Listen, pal, I had to fight off 2 badger-moles, 6 wolf-bats, and 18 hog-monkeys to get these guys.<eos> So sorry if I don't have the paperwork.<eos> I was too busy cramming it in a hog-monkey's mouth While it was trying to eat me.
- You think you know how to defeat this thing?<eos> - You must act like an infection:<eos> Break the skin and attack the vital organs.<eos> Disconnect the heart and the brain, and this beast cannot live.<eos> - But how are we supposed to get inside?<eos> - Future industries has plasma says for cutting platinum.<eos> If we had one on the mecha-suit...<eos> - But the saws are way too big.<eos> We'd never get the suits off the ground.<eos> - I think I can add an electrical element to the welding torch on your suit and convert it into a plasma saw.

I think if somebody wanted their revenge on the judge, they got it.<eos> Let's get to work.<eos> What, if anything, did you find inside the canister?<eos> I recovered a .38 caliber revolver from inside the canister.<eos> Can you tell us the ballistics report on that gun?<eos> They match the bullets found in the skull of the victim, Thomas Dunne.<eos> And what did you do with that gun?<eos> I vouchered it with the property clerk.<eos> Can you walk us through the vouchering process?<eos> Uh, procedure is, I safeguard the weapon, bring it back to my command, obtain a voucher, and using a scribe, scratch my initials on the frame.
Hope for you yet, Donovan.<eos> If I told you I knew about your family, promise to take a little friendly advice?<eos> Hang on.<eos> You know who my family is?<eos> Read any history book about the town's founding members.<eos> The guys that live in this house are Damon and Stefan Salvatore.<eos> Why are you just telling me this now?<eos> Because...<eos> They're vampires, and wherever they go, death and pain always follow.<eos> So if you're looking for family, you're not gonna find it here.
Look, I know you're an activist and you're all about taking on the one percent, but do you see anybody like that here?<eos> Look, I may be a salesman, but just so you know, I'm not a big earner.<eos> Okay, I am barely scraping by.<eos> Jared, these are working people... your people.<eos> You don't want to hurt them.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't.<eos> But I will if I have to.<eos> Take a picture.<eos> Text it to HRT.
I don't want a ticker-tape parade or anything like that, but did you not just hear what I said?<eos> Listen, Javi.<eos> This is about more than a suicide vest.<eos> The CDC turned up a lethal variant of the H5N1 virus in Stone's apartment.<eos> It's a hot zone.<eos> Stone's infected... and everyone around him might be, too.<eos> I got the door open!<eos> I got it!<eos> Close that door!<eos> I said close it now!
- Officer Sprayberry?<eos> - Stash house on Kinzie Street tied to Lemond Bishop.<eos> And did you ever see the cocaine that you believed belonged to Mr. Bishop again after you checked it in?<eos> - No.<eos> - Do you... normally see evidence again<eos> - after you check it in?<eos> - Standard operating procedure is for the recovering officer to transport it for testing.<eos> But Mr. Agos insisted on taking this cocaine to the lab.<eos> Yes. He said he needed a quick check, off the books,<eos> - so they could link it to Bishop.
How in the world does it possibly impact my work as a prosecutor to ask about my family's most vulnerable moments?<eos> - This city is suffering from the worst murder spree in its history, and you're asking me about my son's abortion?<eos> - Are you frigging kidding me?<eos> - Okay. Let's unpack that.<eos> Good second half, though I'm not sure about "frigging."<eos> And bad first half.<eos> You can't personalize it, Alicia.<eos> It's not Frank.<eos> Well, if he asks about Zach, then it is about Frank.<eos> The passion is good, you just have to control it.
Our mission is about to commence.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Hurry. Come on.<eos> Guys, I don't think we should do this.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> We're going to get in trouble.<eos> Mia, tell your sister not to be so scared.<eos> You said I could have the camera.<eos> I'll give it to you in a minute.
Good.<eos> Why don't you go ahead and leave it in park?<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> This is Agent Callen,<eos> Sam Hanna's partner.<eos> You must be Assistant U.S. Attorney Sullivan.<eos> Get out of the car.<eos> Tell me everything you have on Hanna.<eos> Do not make me pull out my gun.<eos> Well, if you did that, I'd just take it from you.
By all accounts, he's an upstanding citizen.<eos> So, what is it that's so special about this place, they had to break in and kill the owner just to gain access?<eos> I mean, there's lots of empty garages around here.<eos> Right, but the owner could have surprised them, or, uh... maybe the killer's just sick.<eos> Oh, that's for sure, but...<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> What?<eos> What do you got?<eos> My buddy owns a custom car shop.<eos> He says that you can form carbon fiber into any shape, you just need an oven to cure it.
Actually, in "ye olden days""<eos> they used the poison to kill wolves, which is why everyone knows that wolfsbane is an effective deterrent against werewolves.<eos> Deeks. Hmm? What?<eos> Whoa, what the what? What is that doing on your desk?<eos> I thought you put it there.<eos> Why would I give you a poisonous plant?<eos> I didn't know it was poisonous until right now.<eos> Well, I certainly didn't give it to you.<eos> And don't get closer-- it's got deadly nectar and-and poisonous pollen and all sorts of...<eos> Don't. It's only deadly if you ingest it or touch it.
Maybe she had nothing to do with Granger.<eos> And maybe the real culprit panicked when Hetty put the whole place on lockdown.<eos> Using her murder as a smokescreen.<eos> You got to see this.<eos> See that?<eos> Ligature bruising from the hanging?<eos> Yeah. But then, look at that.<eos> There's a whole 'nother ligature wound.<eos> It's lighter and hard to see, but it's definitely there.<eos> No, I see it.
Villains never do.<eos> Don't be ridiculous, dearie.<eos> When Belle and Henry wake up tomorrow morning in New York City, they won't remember a thing about tonight.<eos> I'll tell then the Snow Queen destroyed Storybrooke, whilst I saved everyone I could.<eos> I won't be a villain.<eos> I'll be a hero.<eos> Stop.<eos> This must end, Ingrid.<eos> Our magic is a part of us now.<eos> We control it, and we control it really well.
The last time I saw you, you threatened to kill yourself because your girlfriend kissed someone else.<eos> How are you and Dr. Lahiri doing?<eos> You know, I'm worried about the two of you.<eos> Oh, no, no, the only thing you need to worry about is that I might murder her, but other than that...<eos> That was a joke.<eos> I was joking.<eos> She's been late a lot recently.<eos> You know what, don't worry about it.<eos> Thank you for the brochure.<eos> I'm gonna take a look at it right now.

Sandrine Jaulin.<eos> 17 Allée des Trèfles. La Courneuve.<eos> Tell him to check out the address.<eos> Can you check it out?<eos> I'll get the IG down to dust for prints.<eos> Go meet Tintin.<eos> So? - What do we know about the house?<eos> - It looks empty.<eos> Let's call a locksmith.<eos> We'll go over it with a fine- tooth comb.
Have you seen him?<eos> - What's that I hear?<eos> You can't find your little men in that super junky room of yours?<eos> It's not that bad.<eos> - How'd that get in there? - You left your window - wide open for things to just fly in and out.<eos> - Aww, give him a break, P.<eos> My room's messy, but I always find what I'm looking for.<eos> - Then why haven't you found my magic ax?<eos> - I haven't looked for it yet.<eos> Amethyst, go and find it right this second.
- All right.<eos> Well, it was a pleasure to meet you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, you're "Beckin," and I'm "mom."<eos> I don't want to, like, bother him with every little detail of my personal life.<eos> Captain, flag on the play.<eos> Fire department says we may have a gang-related arson/homicide on our hands.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh, after fire put out the car, patrol ran the plates.<eos> It's registered to Luis, the rims look right, and he drove it home yesterday.
I don't know.<eos> This guy doesn't strike me as someone who knows how to give up when he's behind.<eos> - You know what I mean? - Oh.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Yeah, release Zippo to his dirtbag attorney and tell Joe that I'm coming down to drive him home.<eos> What is this?<eos> Some kind of a joke?<eos> You... you didn't print up a retirement application?<eos> Oh, that's mine.<eos> Forgot all about it.
I'm a doctor.<eos> You're a psychiatrist.<eos> I went to medical school.<eos> Fine.<eos> Just make it quick.<eos> You have a foot fetish or something?<eos> Hurry it up.<eos> You got a sprain and I'm concerned about that cut.<eos> Since we don't have any ointment,<eos> I'll do my best to stabilize it.
Don't try to be smart Thomas.<eos> It doesn't suit you.<eos> Alright, everyone. Father Clements doesn't have much time, so we'll get right to it.<eos> Detective, you will be at the front of the aisle with your best man.<eos> Who is your best man?<eos> Oh, I don't... what does a best man do?<eos> - Well, traditionally...<eos> - He gives you the ring.<eos> - I have the ring.<eos> - Well, pick a best man, give him the ring and he'll hand it back to you.
And afterwards, Johnny called it one of the best TV performances that he had ever done.<eos> We have had a lot of historic moments take place in this room across all genres of music.<eos> Nelson: And they had good sound for a change, on TV.<eos> Most of the time TV sound hadn't got that good yet, but Austin City Limits and Terry and those guys worked on it and they came up with a pretty reasonable sound for a studio in television, and that's why a lot of the bands wanted to go there.<eos> All right, clap your hands!<eos> Come on, let's go!<eos> When the Foo Fighters played Austin City Limits it was a big deal for all of us because we'd all grown up watching the show.<eos> When you walk into that room and you step foot on that stage, you can feel the ghosts and the spirits come out of it.<eos> There's something about that stage that's just different than anywhere else.<eos> I don't know if they realized how important the show was when they first started doing it.
Yeah.<eos> Killer took his credentials but not this.<eos> Driver's license, cash, credit cards-- it's all there.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> He wasn't looking to play air marshal very long.<eos> Just long enough to go to the airport to do what he needed to do.<eos> Whatever that was, he was obviously killed before he got the job done.<eos> Unless his job was to kill Beers and take his identity.<eos> And deliver his weapon to the airport.<eos> But deliver it to who?
He led them on a wild-goose chase, hoping to get away with that stolen loot.<eos> Why you looking at us like that?<eos> Waiting for the first question.<eos> Navy or Marines?<eos> Neither.<eos> He murk some seaman when he robbed him?<eos> Nope, no direct military connection to our dead man.<eos> Then why are we here?<eos> That stolen gun is Navy-issued.<eos> So we find the owner and return it.
But clearly, we got to have an answer on this King Moonracer thing.<eos> All right.<eos> Here's the plan.<eos> We sequester Darrin away with no outside influence.<eos> He watches the entire "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" special, and whatever he decides, we live with it, no matter what.<eos> Done.<eos> Our whole, entire friendship is at stake.<eos> This is serious business.<eos> I will watch this cartoon for you.<eos> Hey, dad, I've been working on the family Christmas letter, and I want to run it by you.
I see the way you two look at one another.<eos> And I understand.<eos> For me, it's only been a short time that I've been away.<eos> But for him, years have passed.<eos> His heart moved on.<eos> He's in love with you, Regina.<eos> And I think you're in love with him.<eos> Well, it doesn't really matter.<eos> He's a man of honor.<eos> He made a vow to you, and he's going to keep it.
The presence of a special being.<eos> But one of the other dolls didn't appreciate that you stole the spotlight.<eos> Right.<eos> We found the Lexy suit.<eos> We know that it belonged to a Nelson Kern.<eos> His DNA is all over it.<eos> Mr. Kern took a look at you and Charlene, and he figured that if he couldn't outshine the new girl, he'd find some way to become her.<eos> Broke into your place, he stole the suit and he took your wife out for a spin.<eos> And it cost him his life, didn't it?<eos> Mr. Russell, much as I may cherish the memory of my wife, her beauty, and wanted to possess it,
Same goes for this broken champagne glass.<eos> Left after the Hornet's trick shot.<eos> Confirms... somebody used it for a different kind of trick.<eos> This is weird.<eos> Check out these marks left in blood.<eos> What's it look like to you?<eos> Looks like a ball rolled through the blood, landed in the corner pocket.<eos> Only one problem.<eos> There's no ball in there.<eos> Well, maybe the killer took it.
Oh, my God. So, you knew him?<eos> Oh, a long time ago.<eos> I-I used to wait tables where he bartended.<eos> I thought he was in prison.<eos> Yeah, he got out.<eos> Bubbles?<eos> Where are you?<eos> And you need to let us in.<eos> Come on, Bubbles, fetch me a beer. Make it snappy this time.<eos> Why don't you go and fetch it yourself?
Although, you know, fun fact.<eos> Mice don't actually like cheese.<eos> Isn't that great?<eos> Shh, shh, shh. So we have an hour until the eclipse.<eos> It's time to go home, Bonnie.<eos> I want to remember.<eos> Well, you're a day late and a dollar short, huh?<eos> I mean, I want to try.<eos> Knowing that there's this whole piece of my life missing, it's... it's driving me crazy, ok?<eos> So I have to at least try to get it back.
Why them?<eos> Because in our coven, twins are in line to be leaders.<eos> Hence our lame-ass name...<eos> Gemini.<eos> Kai wanted to be the leader, but that wasn't possible if Lukas and Olivia were alive.<eos> So I protected them with magic.<eos> Which just pissed him off more.<eos> Where are they?<eos> My brother was born without his own magic.<eos> He can only draw it from others.
Listen. Enjoy the leftovers.<eos> You should have brought me with you.<eos> Well, first, you should have told me that Bonnie was alive, and then you should have brought me with you.<eos> Well, Ric had more frequent flyer miles, and Ric didn't deliberately forget our entire relationship.<eos> Yeah. I deserve that.<eos> So you and Bonnie spent the last 4 months together?<eos> Yeah. What did you do?<eos> Bicker mostly.<eos> Cooked, ate.<eos> We went through a Tetris phase, but I beat it, and she got mad.
Her behavior is escalating, it's accelerating.<eos> And you're worried that the rejection of being dumped as a patient could potentially turn her violent.<eos> We're gonna need a name, Dr. Lewis.<eos> You're justified in breaking privilege.<eos> What's her name?<eos> It's Claudia Burke.<eos> What does Claudia suffer from?<eos> Claudia is a paranoid schizophrenic with auditory hallucinations.<eos> I wrote you a song.<eos> I want to play it, but first, you need to know that it was inspired by your eyes, a soft blue like the ocean.
Go ahead.<eos> Ask her.<eos> She'll tell you.<eos> She's really good in bed, too.<eos> Passionate and hungry, all those things an unhappy marriage brings.<eos> Everyone will know that you killed yourself because you're a failure as a husband and as a psychiatrist.<eos> Dr. Lewis' car is still in the parking lot along with a late model sedan registered to Jason Walker.<eos> I got the building manager to give me the keys.<eos> Your case, your call.<eos> How you want to play it?
It's all replaceable.<eos> Let's just be glad you didn't get killed.<eos> Damn it.<eos> If I hadn't been asleep...<eos> What happened?<eos> Do you remember?<eos> I was sleeping, and then they broke the window, and they pulled me out of it, and...<eos> And I tried to hold on, but I got stuck in the door, and they dragged me for a while, and then they punched me, and then they kicked me, and...<eos> And then I couldn't hold on anymore.<eos> God, why didn't you just let them take it?
So did you.<eos> I patched up guys.<eos> I can no more, you know, re-jigger a hard drive...<eos> - Reformat.<eos> - What?<eos> Reformat a hard drive.<eos> You gave what you had to give.<eos> You served.<eos> And you deserve all the help and gratitude that's offered to you.<eos> But if you think that by accepting this help you're taking it away from the next guy, you are wrong.
You don't know exactly what you're about to face.<eos> I have a brain tumor.<eos> It's inoperable.<eos> I thought I had longer, but it's growing.<eos> Soon, I will show symptoms, and after that, I will die.<eos> Who knows about this?<eos> Hunt?<eos> Uh, anyone?<eos> Fetal surgery is a new field.<eos> The few of us who are practicing it are basically inventing it as we go along.
Hang in there.<eos> They'll show.<eos> - How's McQuaid doing?<eos> - No change.<eos> He's still stable but critical.<eos> I'll get over there later to check on him.<eos> Hold on a sec.<eos> I'm sending you a photo.<eos> Tell me when you get it.<eos> See if you can run it through the database and get an I.D.
I need you to do something for me.<eos> Next time you see Ms. Delaney, I want you to put this in her wallet.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because I'm asking.<eos> Can I ask what it is?<eos> No. Look, Mr. Bishop, I'm telling you the truth.<eos> She's not focusing on you.<eos> Then put that in her wallet, and we'll be good.<eos> I apprised the university of the progress of these proceedings, and they gave me this statement.<eos> Would you like to read it?
Good luck with that.<eos> I think we have a problem.<eos> Clear it out. Let's go.<eos> Clear out. Clear out.<eos> Looks like we're dealing with a plastic explosive...<eos> C4, approximately 2 kilos.<eos> Sir, the blasting cap's wired to a receiver.<eos> We found our detonator.<eos> This thing can be detonated remotely.<eos> We need to jam the frequencies in case this nut job tries to set it off and blow us to hell.
No way.<eos> Lizzie, there are, like, thousands of other oboists out there with ten times more experience than me whose lifelong dream it is to play with the New York Symphony.<eos> Hi.<eos> Is this Alex?<eos> Yeah, hey.<eos> This is Lizzie, the hostess with the mostest.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hailey has your scarf.<eos> She's wondering if she can bring it by tonight.
Go.<eos> No, it's like 12:15.<eos> He's going to think it's a booty call.<eos> Oh, perish the thought.<eos> - Wrap this scarf around his booty.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Here's your scarf.<eos> Sorry I'm so late getting it back.
The light refracted off this crystal will create a prism which will show if there are blood traces anywhere.<eos> Like there on the banister.<eos> A real maid would've cleaned better, Camille.<eos> You're brilliant.<eos> Of course I am.<eos> Why is everyone always surprised by that?<eos> You are under arrest for the...<eos> Both of you.<eos> In the closet.<eos> Put the gun on the floor and slide it over here, or I'll kill him.
But are you willing to lay down your son's?<eos> Guys, what if there's another way?<eos> Jenny, you're not carrying the Sword.<eos> That's not what I was gonna pitch.<eos> But thanks for thinking of me.<eos> From what I can gather, the moment you kill someone,<eos> - the Sword consumes your soul.<eos> - So it says.<eos> What if your soul has already been claimed?<eos> Then the Sword would be unable to consume it.
Candy is free. Old lady Daniels says nothing in this world is free.<eos> Oh, hey, and look!<eos> I also got this rock.<eos> Hey, Wirt, want to learn some rock facts?<eos> So, you want to go look for frogs with me like you said you would awhile ago and haven't done it yet?<eos> - Nah.<eos> Nah, I'm busy.<eos> - Is that bee named Sara? - W-What?<eos> - Your tape says "for Sara. "<eos> Are you gonna give it to Sara the bee?
But fundraising is not mundane, my dear.<eos> Neither is my art.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll do my best to limit the number you have to attend.<eos> On my word.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I, uh, I know that you're less than enthusiastic about the social media proposals.<eos> No, it's fine, it's fine.<eos> And the photo shoot?<eos> I'll do it.
I think you're in my seat.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm supposed to be in this one.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Opening night is always so exciting.<eos> Always.<eos> You probably recognize my voice.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> My voice, you might recognize it.
Can I ask you to do an exercise during the week?<eos> Homework?<eos> - Am I grounded?<eos> - No.<eos> I'd like you to pay attention to when you feel a really strong emotion.<eos> Happiness, anger, fear...<eos> Whatever...<eos> Pay attention?<eos> To what?<eos> Just pay attention and treat that emotion well. Take it as it is and show it, if possible.
And?<eos> The members voted for an entirely vegetal fertilizer.<eos> "The members" this, "the members" that...<eos> Is this a garden or a sect?<eos> Leave it over there.<eos> I'll give it to someone.<eos> OK.<eos> Anything else I can do for you?<eos> Help me turn the soil over.<eos> You're giving it away?
They worry you'll put your sex life above caring for Léo<eos> - Is that true?<eos> - Fucking pensioners<eos> They'll brag that they used to foster kids and can take care of Léo<eos> No one cares that they were a foster family<eos> This is about you and your ability to care for Léo<eos> These accusations of multiple partners - are they true?<eos> Of course not! This is rubbish. They're gunning for me<eos> They say it wasn't the first time you'd taken Sandrine's bank card<eos> I didn't take it.
Now that things have died down, maybe she'll come back<eos> - And the robbers?<eos> - No.<eos> We don't know them it's the third time they've raided cash points here it's often for small change<eos> They've taken about 30,000 Euros.<eos> Not much, considering the risks<eos> The hooded guy on fire...<eos> The picture isn't very clear but if you enlarge it...<eos> The judge has sent it to the lab. She wants to see a clearer image<eos> We should get it back soon
- May i make an observation?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - You're loyal to voight.<eos> That's admirable.<eos> But you're catching a rep as voight's girl.<eos> The longer you stay here, The more that perception takes hold, And you're just gonna end up carrying that<eos> - I should be so lucky.<eos> - Erin, you could be going places.<eos> Or not.<eos> - Steve, i appreciate the offer, And i am considering it.
I just want to know, have you grown close to him?<eos> What's between you?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> I... He's let me know he's interested, is all.<eos> Would he be surprised if you went back to his estate?<eos> - A moment ago you said he was dangerous.<eos> - He is.<eos> More than you know... which is why I must ask you, for me, to go there tonight.<eos> Tell him that you were on your way back to the castle and your horses needed tending, and when you're admitted, hide this envelope.<eos> Somewhere he won't find it.

Notify the head of the kingsguard.<eos> I need men ready to leave.<eos> Now.<eos> Stephan Narcisse, you are suspected of treason.<eos> By authority of the king, you will submit to a search of your house.<eos> This is an outrage.<eos> I've committed no crime against the Crown.<eos> Bash and the guards searched Narcisse's home thoroughly.<eos> The cipher was no longer where you planted it.<eos> He must have found it and surely knows that you put it there.
Where are we?<eos> Callen and Sam are almost at the courthouse.<eos> Agent Sanchez is already there.<eos> Does he have Turner?<eos> Can't find him, but Peña's under heavy guard.<eos> Guys?<eos> I think I found Monica.<eos> Okay, I spotted this van near Monica's place last night around the time of her abduction.<eos> Now, it's the same van in Goodsell's photos.<eos> And Kaleidoscope just picked it up an hour ago parked here.
Who?<eos> Remember me?<eos> I'm like Girl Dipper.<eos> Ugh, go away.<eos> I heard a "come in."<eos> Ahh!<eos> Hey!<eos> Listen, kid, nobody in the Pines family is welcome here.<eos> In case you forgot, your stupid brother is the one who ruined my life!<eos> And Mabel's the one who's gonna fix it.
Puppy love, inter-species love, love of country music.<eos> Ew.<eos> Oh! Anti-love.<eos> To reverse the effects of love potion, simply spray on your victim and watch their heart die on the inside.<eos> Sounds good to me.<eos> Hey!<eos> You're the one who's been stealing my stuff.<eos> I am not loving this.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But I made a mistake and I have to fix it.
We haven't appraised it in some time, but I'd put it in the $200,000 range.<eos> But the map taken from that drawer there is worth twice that much.<eos> But you think this one was the real target?<eos> "On permanent loan from Hollis Bray,<eos> October 1951."<eos> That name is familiar to you?<eos> Yeah, I've seen his name on the walls of hospital wings.<eos> Obviously, he's passed away now.<eos> But his family still runs an active charity.<eos> If the map is on loan, it means the Bray family still owns it.
It's Kitty.<eos> The police have indeed found Mr. Zupko.<eos> Oh, that's a good thing, isn't it?<eos> The good news is it looks like Zupko was our guy.<eos> We found all the maps that were taken from the library.<eos> Including the Bray map.<eos> It was the only one that was laid out.<eos> Zupko must have been standing here.<eos> Obviously, he was examining the map when he was killed.<eos> Or displaying it for a buyer.
I don't understand.<eos> Are you saying that he gave them a fake?<eos> That it-it was fake all along?<eos> It's a possibility.<eos> Well, I don't know what to say.<eos> Obviously, he wouldn't have given it to the library knowingly.<eos> What-what would he have stood to gain?<eos> All right, just so we're clear, Miss Bray, no one's trying to embarrass you or your family.<eos> The reason we're sharing this is-- the last person to handle that map is dead.<eos> There's a theory of evidence that suggests that Stuart Zupko was hired to steal it.
That was abrupt.<eos> But satisfying, no?<eos> Well, should we call Captain Gregson?<eos> So that Hull and his cronies can deny this meeting ever took place? What's the point?<eos> Well, he said it himself.<eos> He might know who hired Zupko. Bollocks.<eos> If he did, he would've passed that information to the police the same way he bought that atlas. Anonymously.<eos> No. The real purpose of this meeting was to buy our allegiance.<eos> He knows that we seek the Bray map.<eos> And in the event we find it, he wants to ensure we pass it to no one but him.
They were worried that the original would kill their project, so they planned to discredit it by replacing it with this one.<eos> Would you like to know where the casino is going to go?<eos> Right here.<eos> Your family still owns land just outside the reservation, land that would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, but only if the casino went forward.<eos> There would be hotels, restaurants...<eos> Pawnshops, the odd money lender...<eos> Now, you knew about your grandfather's map and the trouble it would cause once people noticed it.<eos> People like, say, William Hull.<eos> This all started when the library put a scan of the map online.<eos> You couldn't just steal it and make it disappear.

If she's not lost.<eos> She has a terrible sense of direction.<eos> You know, I could have sworn that this used to squeak.<eos> It did.<eos> I fixed it.<eos> Bonnie and I came here every day.<eos> It as the closest thing I had to a picture of you, and I needed every reminder I could get.<eos> It's funny.<eos> I used to have so many good memories of this house, and after just one bad one, I burned it down.<eos> I just couldn't bear to look at it again.
Your father said you were basically useless.<eos> Remember when that happened, we were so happy?<eos> So come on.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> - I gotta go.<eos> - Yes, you have to go right here!<eos> Are you okay, Ma?<eos> I'm as okay as I can be in this Topsy-turvy world.<eos> Maybe we can watch your show with you.<eos> Yeah, Ma, we'll all watch it together.
Deep within the Royal Vault there is a statue called the Palladium.<eos> It is said Atlantis will never fall while it remains within its walls.<eos> Less than an hour ago the Palladium was stolen.<eos> If the army find out about this they will desert and the city will fall.<eos> You want us to retrieve it?
~ Perhaps we lost it?<eos> ~ Or perhaps it found us.<eos> Hold him.<eos> Sh!<eos> Sh!<eos> (Sorry!<eos> ) Sorry.<eos> What was that thing?<eos> I believe it was a Cyclops.<eos> Did you kill it?
Right now, we're here to talk to you about this jacket.<eos> The one you sold this guy.<eos> Where'd you get it?<eos> At the port.<eos> Here in New Orleans?<eos> In Karachi.<eos> I visit a few times a year to get rugs to sell.<eos> There is a boy, Sami-- he helps me load cargo.<eos> He was wearing the coat.<eos> Why'd you want it?
And Mara?<eos> Out there somewhere, causing havoc.<eos> And I have to admit, I like our Audrey much better.<eos> And I'm sorry it came to this, but why won't you let her help us?<eos> Because she's clever, like Mara.<eos> Charlotte?<eos> I want my ring.<eos> I'm not giving this to you until you tell us what's going on.<eos> I'll tell you everything, but first, I want my ring back.<eos> Nathan, will you hand it to me?
Honestly, I don't know how straight guys do it.<eos> Probably without those hand gestures.<eos> So, nice bath?<eos> Oh, yeah, the best.<eos> I'm so ready for bed.<eos> Okay.<eos> Ooh, by the way, I left a ring in there.<eos> Oh, well, we'll get at it with some bleach in the morning.<eos> No, no, no, my wedding ring.<eos> I just don't feel like wearing it anymore.
Yeah, give me your boot there, Christopher.<eos> - What?<eos> - Give me your boot.<eos> All right! I want this boot filled by the end of the week.<eos> - [All grumbling] - It's always something.<eos> - Come on! - Listen up, listen up.<eos> The good shepherd soup kitchen that I run has an oven that doesn't get above 100 degrees, has a kitchen that the city is going to condemn.<eos> Now, that means a lot of cold, homeless Chicagoans are gonna get turned away during the holidays.<eos> - I can't have that.<eos> - We'll fill it up, Chaplain.
It's for after the divorce".<eos> And this was so that his wife wouldn't know about it and couldn't access it.<eos> She's an attorney, and she had a lot of reach, and...<eos> Ma'am... when you changed the itinerary to include Venezuela, this is why, isn't it?<eos> Yes.<eos> But you and I are the only two people who are gonna know that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And now you need me to access the account.<eos> Might be the only way we ever find out the truth.<eos> I will help you find it.
Well, it seems her divorce was a tad messier than she led us to believe.<eos> So, what role are you playing now, Ms. Kingsley?<eos> Not the grieving widow.<eos> I need to get back to set, or they're gonna shut down production on "Raiders of the nubian temple."<eos> Yeah, well, you've got bigger problems than that.<eos> So, I talked to Lance's lawyer, and he said that your divorce was anything but amicable.<eos> We're actors.<eos> We're passionate people.<eos> Things got stormy at times.<eos> Because you wanted the Malibu house, and he didn't want to give it to you.
Things got stormy at times.<eos> Because you wanted the Malibu house, and he didn't want to give it to you.<eos> That home has sentimental value to me.<eos> Along with monetary value.<eos> I mean, after 20 years, it's worth... $8 million.<eos> And with Lance out of the picture, it was all yours.<eos> You think I killed my husband?<eos> You tried to before.<eos> Remember the incident where you discharged a firearm... at him?<eos> I was cleaning it.
Anyway, uh, long story short, we almost had sex this afternoon.<eos> It didn't happen, but he's coming over later, and we both know why, and it's kind of messing me up.<eos> Oh, you still have feelings for him.<eos> Of course I do.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's complicated.<eos> Where are the cats?<eos> I put them in the bedroom.<eos> I don't like them to see this side of me.<eos> I'm not crazy about seeing it, either.
The trail leads to the necropolis. A half a dozen or so made it inside.<eos> And Ariadne is with them?<eos> I do not know for sure, but we can presume so.<eos> Then why are your men idle?<eos> They will not venture inside, my lady.<eos> - What?<eos> - I will speak to them.<eos> It will do no good.<eos> They believe no man who enters the necropolis ever returns.<eos> You may find your death in the necropolis, or you may meet it here.
You can't do this.<eos> I am one - of the queen's ladies!<eos> Don't put yourself at risk, do you hear me?<eos> I'll be all right.<eos> I'll be all right! The letter I asked you to deliver to Mary last night, was it delivered?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> The servant I charged with delivering the letter was killed outside Mary's chambers.<eos> He never reached the queen.<eos> I see.<eos> Do you want it back, my lord?

- ls there an address? - What's the address?<eos> She lives with her dad in Bobigny<eos> - Any photos?<eos> - Nico, send me the file<eos> Yeah, to my phone<eos> That's her<eos> - Shall we go?<eos> - Yeah<eos> - Well?<eos> - I'll take it Excellent
They didn't have to catch us so fast.<eos> Servet, run!<eos> God damn it!<eos> My pants are about to explode, Servet!<eos> Stop right there!<eos> Dear Lord!<eos> - We're doomed this time.<eos> - Stop, stop.<eos> Police! We're seizing your car!<eos> Our people will return it to you.
Hammond's car wasn't much better.<eos> Um, can anyone else smell burning?<eos> And we still had 900 miles to go.<eos> It was a dried up lake bed.<eos> I see it now as a racetrack<eos> Argh! Can you remember where the road was?<eos> This was a mistake.<eos> Just get on.<eos> It's bloody dangerous, this. Bloody dangerous.<eos> I claim this land for Norfolk and name it Lotus Beach.
I know he's got the most brilliant sense of direction in the world...<eos> This was a mistake.<eos> Very soft there, very soft there, keep going, keep going, very soft.<eos> Oooh!<eos> Ooh.<eos> Here goes nothing.<eos> Wouldn't ordinarily do this with a 928, but... I've never felt more hopelessly lost.<eos> 'After many hours, we did find the road, 'but our path to it was blocked by a locked gate.'<eos> That fence goes on forever.<eos> Well, just knock it over.
~ but Argentina think they're theirs. ~ No! ~ I know!<eos> But anyway, let's not get bogged down with that.<eos> The captain's very kindly said he'll drop us here, ~ and then there's a track - can you see?<eos> ~ Oh, yeah, there it is, look.<eos> That goes down there, to Ushuaia.<eos> 'Sadly, for geological reasons, the ferry couldn't dock at the track.<eos> 'So the captain dropped us off a mile down the beach.'<eos> Here we go.<eos> James May is on Tierra del Fuego.<eos> I claim this land for Norfolk, and name it Lotus Beach.
Sorry, this is really brutal.<eos> I'm not stopping.<eos> Get bogged down if I stop.<eos> Got a puncture, I've got a knackered clutch.<eos> 'Just in time, I made it to the pinch point.'<eos> Come on, come on, through the sea. 'And moments later, I was joined by Hank B Hammond.'<eos> RICHARD HAMMOND CHUCKLES Right, only the Lotus now.<eos> I'll be staggered if I get through this bit.<eos> Oh, yes! 'Of course, it's traditional on TV these days 'that everyone always makes it, 'but this is Top Gear, so we didn't.<eos> 'James, therefore, parked his car above the high water mark, 'locked it, weirdly, 'and we made camp, which for once wasn't so bad.'
That's 0.5 higher than my average score.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I forgot that.<eos> I really thought it was going to be him.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Out of the nerdy boy and the good-looking popular boy, I thought there was no chance that my Mr 10 would turn out to be the good-looking popular boy.<eos> Nor me.<eos> So, it seems as if it's Omar.<eos> So, what now?<eos> Well, I was thinking, wouldn't it be romantic if, instead of just asking him out, if I record myself singing a song for him, and put it on YouTube and then dedicate it to him and then send him a link to it on Facebook.
This is a pretty intense injury.<eos> I once had to pull a crossbow arrow out of a man's anterior lobe.<eos> Geez.<eos> The wife claims it was an accident.<eos> [chuckling] Oh, my gosh.<eos> People are crazy.<eos> Okay.<eos> We're ready.<eos> Please pull the drill bit out while I see if the artery needs to be clamped.<eos> Yeah, so just... just... just pull it?
He is a pilot.<eos> He told me, he saw it.<eos> What's past that?<eos> Past the "outer edge; boundary of Memories"?<eos> A mistery.<eos> "Boundary Memories"; that have they built so that the memories only stay within you and me?<eos> - Let's move on.<eos> - Wait!<eos> That boundary is meant to keep the memories in.<eos> So, if a receiver crosses it, is that means the memories get set free?

Be curious.<eos> I got lost ... to good kind of lost!<eos> I saw sites and heard sounds, I had no words to describe.<eos> Faces with flesh of all different colours<eos> I felt so alive ...<eos> This is forbidden?<eos> I did not know what to think, what to believe.<eos> "Have faith", The Giver told me.<eos> He said: "Faith, that was seeing beyond."<eos> He compared it to the wind:
They erased it from our world.<eos> Maybe they were right.<eos> - Could you watch over Harry for me?<eos> Hey, what's wrong?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - I know you.<eos> - You do, do you?<eos> - Yes ...<eos> What do you think would happen if you skip the morning injection?<eos> If you skipped it?
Maybe they were right.<eos> - Could you watch over Harry for me?<eos> Hey, what's wrong?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - I know you.<eos> - You do, do you?<eos> - Yes ...<eos> What do you think would happen if you skip the morning injection?<eos> If you skipped it?<eos> Then the sensors would blink and remind me that I forgot it.
Well Thank you very much for ... helping us to narrow down the possibilities.<eos> - I'll contact you if he comes here.<eos> - Only if it not an impossetion.<eos> Thank you.<eos> He's lying...<eos> - Talk! - They are going to kill Gabe.<eos> I'm leaving; I'm leaving tonight and I'm going to take him with me.<eos> Jonas Not yet, you're not ready.<eos> When they decided to kill Gabe, they decided I was ready.<eos> I like this map; dont mess it up, I'll be wanting it back.
Walk?<eos> Why am I ?<eos> No, No,No...<eos> Ah, that's right, that's right.<eos> No, I didn't do it.<eos> You're right.<eos> Dead!<eos> What are you trying to look for?<eos> Sunbae, by chance haven't you seen a hairpin?<eos> Just now Joon Hyeon oppa threw it away.
He ran away.<eos> And... that was the end of my jazz career.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, that's a shame.<eos> What was the next career?<eos> - I'm an art consultant. - Really?<eos> I'm actually in the city buying a painting.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What's the piece?<eos> I don't know if you'd know it.
No, it's complicated.<eos> There's just someone I wanted to see.<eos> The bride?<eos> Nope.<eos> The groom?<eos> No.<eos> But what about you?<eos> I'm guessing the purse was the gift from your husband?<eos> Think you might be missing some hardware.<eos> I have a ring, but I'm not wearing it because it's being repaired back in Boston.
I don't know how to say this, but I need a huge favor, and I need it now.<eos> Of course, of course, anything.<eos> Okay, so go to my house, and in the backyard there's a key in the magnet box by the pool filter.<eos> Take the key and go in the back door.<eos> The alarm code is 4242.<eos> Go up to the bedroom.<eos> On the bed is a letter.<eos> And it's addressed to Michael.<eos> Take it home and save it for me when I get back.<eos> But listen, promise me that you won't read it.
Oh, my God, Brooke.<eos> I've been trying to call you.<eos> I couldn't get the letter.<eos> There was no key.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> It's in the magnetized box, by the pool filter.<eos> No, it wasn't.<eos> I went over there, and I found the box, but there was no key inside.<eos> Someone must've taken it and not put it back.
If it proves successful, we'll extend it to the other schools and nurseries.<eos> Not only you grab all the roundabout public contracts, you're also going into large-scale catering.<eos> Not large-scale catering, we'll be working with small local producers.<eos> Actually, I'm surprised you didn't make this proposal.<eos> And how do you propose financing this?<eos> Have you been to a school canteen recently?<eos> I don't think so, or you would have done something about it.<eos> The food is vile.<eos> And the children, our children, hate this food.<eos> They simply don't eat it.
It's the windows.<eos> You're thinking there's no windows.<eos> It's subterranean.<eos> It's not cozy, it's claustrophobic.<eos> No. No way. I wasn't thinking that.<eos> I was thinking, "This is really cool."<eos> Caleb, there's a reason there are no windows in this room.<eos> There is?<eos> This building isn't a house. It's a research facility.<eos> Buried in these walls is enough fiber optic cable to reach the moon and lasso it.
Hey, you up there.<eos> Any ideas?<eos> Thanks.<eos> It's obvious.<eos> It's got to be Félix' song.<eos> It's not obvious for us.<eos> You must have shared that with him?<eos> Of course.<eos> You know my song?<eos> Of course we know it.
Why?<eos> Basically, I feel I'm screwing up my life.<eos> That's a good reason.<eos> Our meetings are the cause?<eos> Yes.<eos> I decided to see you to understand my health problems and now I also have behavioral problems.<eos> So, no.<eos> No.<eos> I rather stay sick than to sabotage my professional life.<eos> Are you sabotaging it?
What do you have in mind?<eos> Béatrice can pick her up from school. She could have dinner with her, and then bring her back at 8.<eos> 7:30?<eos> 7:30.<eos> Come here, my beautiful Océane.<eos> Yes!<eos> - Can I take my float off?<eos> - I'd rather you didn't.<eos> But I know how to swim.<eos> I know, but Christophe said you need to wear it.
Search your memory and try to remember any occasion when a relationship did turn out as you expected.<eos> Oh, boy!<eos> It could take weeks, even months.<eos> There must be some.<eos> You don't recognize them yet.<eos> OK.<eos> What should I do with them, if I ever find them?<eos> Try to keep it in mind.<eos> Make a list, if you want.<eos> If you have any doubts, read it.
Right...<eos> We noticed that you take a lot of different substances.<eos> You must be coming down.<eos> What do you think?<eos> You take coke, amphetamines, heroin.<eos> I haven't had heroin in the last 1 year and 2 months.<eos> Way to go.<eos> I mean it. Congratulations.<eos> But the tests show you're taking methadone.<eos> Where do you take it?
The psychiatrist will see you.<eos> I don't want a shrink.<eos> I just want to leave.<eos> Yes, but you have to be stabilized before you leave.<eos> If you want to stabilize me, give me my methadone.<eos> I need it now.<eos> Otherwise, I'll be in withdrawal.<eos> Not yet.<eos> In two hours.<eos> Did my father tell you not to give it to me?
Is that OK?<eos> That's perfect, sweetie.<eos> Yes.<eos> You know,<eos> Jean was just like you.<eos> He had a gift for drawing.<eos> Every...<eos> Dad, we didn't do Jean's spin yesterday, in the end.<eos> - No.<eos> - Can we do it now?
Got myself a hot trainer and was well on my way to losing 50 pounds of pepperoni pizza baby fat.<eos> Everyone was happy.<eos> Prices were going down.<eos> And quality up.<eos> Everyone wanted a piece of the pie.<eos> We had the best-looking girls in town in pairs.<eos> Girls that wouldn't've looked in our direction now were sucking on the big bong.<eos> We were working hard and playing even harder.<eos> And had forgotten old man Grefard's advice about not flashing your hubris and candy apples, whatever.<eos> My head was so far up my ass, national geographic couldn't've found it.
What is it?<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Thought I heard something.<eos> Fucking hear anything...<eos> Shut the fuck up.<eos> Okay, do it.<eos> Scuzz! Put out the fucking cigarette now!<eos> There's nobody here.<eos> Scuzz, put it out!
Oh, my God!<eos> I regret so much.<eos> I'll take my white hat now.<eos> Run!<eos> The curfew's back on!<eos> It's back on!<eos> No more hiding, right?<eos> - Right!<eos> - Right?<eos> You built this thing, you can take it apart!
Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.<eos> She always loved the pictures.<eos> It's an old federal textbook. We've replaced them with the corrected versions.<eos> Corrected?<eos> Explaining how the Apollo missions were faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union.<eos> You don't believe we went to the moon?<eos> It was a brilliant piece of propaganda.<eos> The Soviets bankrupted themselves pouring resources... - into rockets and other useless machines.<eos> - "Useless machines."<eos> If we don't want a repeat of the excess and wastefulness of the 20th century, then... we need to teach our kids about this planet, not tales of leaving it.
Let's go!<eos> Let's go, people!<eos> Say again.<eos> I do not have a visual.<eos> What is your position?<eos> Unreadable.<eos> Say again.<eos> Over.<eos> Hit the deck.<eos> Help me turn it off, man.
Here.<eos> And here.<eos> If you don't hit a skyscraper on the way, meet at rally point Charlie.<eos> - Right here.<eos> Good?<eos> - Doctor, any guesses where to look?<eos> Underground.<eos> If the MUTOS have spawned... they'll be building a nest.<eos> Captain, when you find the warhead...<eos> - how long to disarm it?
Not 13.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> The young one the black-haired archer we stuck him with a Morgul shaft.<eos> The poison's in his blood.<eos> He'll be choking on it soon.<eos> Answer the question, filth.<eos> I would not antagonize her.<eos> You like killing things, Orc?<eos> You like death?<eos> Then let me give it to you.
I can't find it.<eos> It's not here!<eos> Break it down! Aye.<eos> Come on!<eos> Break!<eos> It has to break.<eos> It's no good.<eos> The door's sealed.<eos> Can't be opened by force.<eos> There's a powerful magic on it.
The boy you love.<eos> - No, you're not in love?<eos> No, you don't know him.<eos> It's been such a long time since I saw him...<eos> It was in Edinburgh.<eos> The huge city suited him so well.<eos> The spiky spires soaring in the twilight.<eos> He was a bit scary, but I was reassured by his odd silhouette.<eos> Cut out those tricks, it's dangerous. You'll hurt someone.<eos> Take it off now and then.
Pull over.<eos> Stop the car! Stop...<eos> Ca bit<eos> Charlie!<eos> From the airport.<eos> No, keep it.<eos> It was a gift.<eos> You okay?<eos> I meant to follow the ambulance, but it was driving like some kind of idiot and I lost him.<eos> Look, there's a bunch of traffic. I bet we can still catch it if we go now?
I don't give a flying fart about Billy.<eos> Where am I gonna sleep?<eos> Well, they said they might have some after 6.<eos> So here's the deal:<eos> Lisa wants me to check out the chapel.<eos> Heh, she's got you on a short leash, doesn't she?<eos> - Kids these days.<eos> - Well, would Mrs. Don Rickles happen to know where the chapel is?<eos> I do, and I will show you.<eos> - That's okay, that's fine, I'll find it...
Look you little jerk-off, I don't wanna dance with you.<eos> I don't wanna dance with you either.<eos> - Everything all right here?<eos> - Fanny Pack. You...<eos> You guys are everywhere.<eos> What's your deal?<eos> Can I see that real quick? Buddy, maybe you had too much to drink.<eos> Hey, pal, why don't you mind your business?<eos> You don't wanna make a fool of yourself.<eos> You know what? If I want your opinion, I'll just beat it out of you.
Knowing the guards' routine was the next step.<eos> Thirty seconds into my rec time, my CO took a smoke break.<eos> For seven minutes every day, there were no eyes on me.<eos> Two...<eos> After I knew the routine, all I had to do was pick the day and arrange for a distraction at the front gate for exactly 4:00 p.m.<eos> But at this point, you were still locked inside a steel box.<eos> To get out, you had to have a key code.<eos> You have very good chocolate milk.<eos> See, the cartons contain a thin layer of wax laminate.<eos> Lay it over the keypad, the impression will indicate which four keys were pressed.
Or did you always want to be this?<eos> Two...<eos> One...<eos> Done.<eos> Look.<eos> There.<eos> I told you.<eos> No talent.<eos> The records indicate that you are a highly intelligent man.<eos> As such, I would have expected you to see the situation and understand it for what it is.
I'm home!<eos> - Hey, little guy.<eos> - Hey, darling.<eos> - Hi, Walter.<eos> - Hey, Dad.<eos> I missed you!<eos> Walter, your father has a gift for you.<eos> I have a gift specifically for you, Walter.<eos> There's a little card on there.<eos> Do you want to read it, kiddo?
If you were though, what sport?<eos> The kicking.<eos> The Olympic sport of kicking?<eos> Maybe that's brand new.<eos> What about you, Ron?<eos> What do you think you're going to do?<eos> I've got some exciting investment opportunities<eos> I'm going to look into.<eos> It's funny, I got a call the other day from some clowns who are trying to start up a business where they take water and put it in little plastic bottles, regular water, okay, nothing special about it.<eos> They put it in plastic bottles and they're going to sell it for a dollar.
- Bill!<eos> Journalists back in 1980 thought that a car chase wasn't news.<eos> But Ron Burgundy wasn't a journalist, he was an anchorman.<eos> Good evening.<eos> I'm Ron Burgundy, reporting live from New York.<eos> We have breaking news developing in our nation's heartland.<eos> A high-speed car chase is in progress...<eos> Keep the "Breaking News" logo up. Keep up the graphic.<eos> ...reaching speeds of up to 100 mph.<eos> And for the first time in news history, we will stay with it live until it resolves in either a huge accident or a massive shootout.
- Where'd you think I got 'em, from stroking your ego?<eos> Big booty: good.<eos> Big forearms: no good.<eos> C'mon, let me drive.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> - You're an asshole!<eos> - I didn't do it on purpose!<eos> Let me drive.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> You ruined my car before you even started driving it.
- You okay?<eos> - No, I'm not okay! Fuck your house, Franco!<eos> My house didn't do that!<eos> You don't got a tool kit or nothing?<eos> Just a toolbox? I don't know.<eos> Where's the edge of this shit?<eos> Your thumb's in my butthole, man.<eos> Y'all need this dick?<eos> No, we're not using it.<eos> All right, I'm gonna take it over here.
I will cum like a fucking madman all over you, McBride!<eos> I fucking wish you'd cum on me right now.<eos> I fucking dare you to cum on me!<eos> God! I'm gonna jack my dick so fucking hard in here!<eos> This, no more, man. All over your fucking face.<eos> This fucking all more.<eos> All over the fucking place! I'll fucking cum anywhere I want!<eos> I'll fucking cum on these walls!<eos> I'll cum on the fucking cabinets! On the fucking furniture!<eos> I'll cum everywhere! If I see your dick one more time, I'm gonna fucking shoot it off!
She was fucked up. She was high.<eos> It was at the Chateau Marmont, and she kept banging on my door.<eos> She kept calling me Jake Gyllenhaal.<eos> That's fucked up. Yeah, I said, "Call me the Prince of Persia."<eos> See, that's what I'm saying, man.<eos> We've all done bad shit, you know?<eos> We've done more bad shit than good in our lives, and it's time to pay the piper.<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> God did this.<eos> He gave us light, and then He took it away.
The United States Navy does not rob banks.<eos> Its personnel did not rob a bank.<eos> I'm not gonna tarnish the integrity of the Navy over one crooked sailor.<eos> If there was money taken from the bank that was part of an illegal CIA slush fund, the Navy had no knowledge the fund existed.<eos> Your jacket has you six months AWOL?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> It's gonna stay that way.<eos> Commander Quince's jacket will likewise be amended so he's also AWOL, making none of this the Navy's problem.<eos> Sir, this isn't right.<eos> Well, I'd offer more, but when the hand has gangrene, you chop it off to save the body.
- I'll ditch these clowns.<eos> I'll see you up on the roof in five minutes.<eos> Just gonna try and get my beak wet real quick.<eos> You know what I'm talking about?<eos> I'll see you up there.<eos> Damn betcha.<eos> Come on!<eos> I thought that was just a theory.<eos> Well, it was.<eos> If I'm right, we can access the area of the brain that governs repair... and chemically recode it. Essentially, you're hacking into the genetic... operating system...
Once we get the Patriot installed, it will take me nine or 10 minutes for the takedown.<eos> That's great, but the last time I looked, there was somebody inside of it.<eos> Afternoon, gentlemen.<eos> Hello, Colonel.<eos> Step aside.<eos> We'll get you out of there.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You'll damage the armour.<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> But you can fix it, right?
Happy birthday, Carter.<eos> Here we go, everybody.<eos> Happy birthday, pal.<eos> Are you one?<eos> Are you two?<eos> Are you three?<eos> Are you four? I hope she chokes on your dick!<eos> Well, at least she gets close to it!
Thanks, Gary.<eos> Found it.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You know what? I'll go to a wedding with your father.<eos> You will?<eos> As soon as he pays me that $485,000 he owes me for my share of the lake house.<eos> Larry Ellis was waterskiing there last weekend and he saw a light on.<eos> Is your father using it'?<eos> You know he's not allowed to use it. Mom, no one's been there in 2O years.<eos> Because he's renting it! He's renting it!
First one. Right there.<eos> Go look. Right there.<eos> Right there, right there.<eos> First cabinet. Second shelf, third tray, first cassette.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> That one. That one.<eos> "Tape one.<eos> Doucett."<eos> Go ahead, play it.<eos> Listen to it.
El Dorado Trust is the terminus of the wire, right?<eos> So all you gotta do is ping the wire and the pulse echo will tell you how far away it is.<eos> Why didn't I think of that?<eos> Hey, keep an eye out.<eos> Remember 75.<eos> And bingo.<eos> You gotta be shitting me.<eos> Am I the only one who thinks this is fucking insane?<eos> Because there's an alarm, it goes right to Cohen.<eos> It'll take me 10 minutes to find it and disable it.
No, huh-uh.<eos> My momma was a mean.. nasty-mean old lady.<eos> I suppose that's where I get it..<eos> You're not nasty-mean.<eos> You're our mother and we love you.<eos> Is the coast clear?<eos> Never very.<eos> What are you watching?<eos> Television.<eos> Can I watch it with you?
Girl, you up in that house now!<eos> I want to hear all the stories.<eos> I don't know how many stories you gonna hear... 'cause they done swore him to some kind of secret code... and he can't tell me nothing.<eos> No. Girl, you give it to him right.<eos> Mm-hm! He'll tell you everything.<eos> That's the key right there.<eos> You listening?<eos> Did you hear her?<eos> Who you been giving it to?<eos> Well, if you was at home, I could be giving it to you.
That mess right there happened down South.<eos> This could have been me.<eos> It happened down South.<eos> I got out of there so we could have us a better life.<eos> Right now, I'm working for the white man, make things better for us.<eos> And not just any white man, either.<eos> Put the lights off.<eos> Go to bed.<eos> I have your chicken soup, Mr. President.<eos> Just set it on the table, Cecil.
A Secret Serviceman has been...<eos> They killed our man.<eos> "He's dead." Whether he referred to President Kennedy, or not... is not yet known.<eos> The president, cradled in the arms of his wife, Mrs. Kennedy... was carried to an ambulance and the car rushed to Parkland Hospital outside Dallas...<eos> Mrs. Kennedy refused to change her clothes... so that everybody could see what they did to her husband.<eos> The last time I saw that much blood... was the day my daddy was killed.<eos> Please tell me how I could help you.<eos> Ma, what you doing?<eos> Here.<eos> Want you to take this box and put it in the basement.
The snipers may be only two, or three... invisible to the buildings beyond the wall.<eos> But there is also a machine gun down the street to the left.<eos> Dr. King, you might want to lie down with that fever.<eos> President Johnson is making a tragic error in Vietnam.<eos> Move over, big yellow.<eos> Why shouldn't we fight in Vietnam?<eos> The Vietcong don't call us "niggers," for one.<eos> Seriously, how many of your parents support the war?<eos> Well, my Lord.<eos> Why do your parents support it?

Dominate, Nick!<eos> Dominate!<eos> Hello, Wilson.<eos> How's business?<eos> Yeah, I can't complain.<eos> So when are you gonna...<eos> - sell me that car?<eos> - I've still got my man working on it.<eos> Yeah, well, he works pretty slow, don't he?<eos> Maybe I'd better sell it somewhere else.
But he never accepted them as his parents at all.<eos> In his own imagination, he was a son of God... destined for... future glory.<eos> Chasing this destiny, a 16-year-old Gatz ran far, far away.<eos> One afternoon, off the coast of Lake Superior, he spotted a yacht in peril.<eos> He rowed out and rescued the vessel... and its captain, alcoholic millionaire Dan Cody.<eos> You're gonna hit the shoal!<eos> We're gonna hit the shoal!<eos> What the hell are you doing...<eos> - old sport?<eos> - This was... his opportunity and he seized it.
I have a job for you.<eos> It's a hell of a view, my old friend.<eos> That should stop...<eos> - ...the bleeding.<eos> - What is it?<eos> Yarrow.<eos> It's just a weed that grows everywhere, but it can be useful.<eos> You know a lot about the land.<eos> Ought to. Been working it all my life.<eos> Whereas I have merely owned it.
That depends on how well you pay, sir.<eos> If you give me a show I won't ever forget, you will be amply rewarded.<eos> That I can do.<eos> I can't express what a challenge it will be for you to amaze me.<eos> I'm addicted to the magical arts.<eos> It's my religion.<eos> Well, then, let us pray together.<eos> Addictions can be a very corruptive path.<eos> A man can lose his soul.<eos> Or gain it.
I'd say we found Mr. Luger's office.<eos> This is Egyptian. I've seen this before.<eos> Looks like solid gold.<eos> Charlemagne's armor.<eos> Look at this.<eos> I can see your footprints.<eos> I think I found what killed Charles Pinworth.<eos> Kills the body, mind and soul.<eos> You might want to see this.<eos> Wherever the healing stream flows is the box and Luger is digging for it around the hotel.
"Wow, I'm only at mile one.<eos> I've got 25.2 miles to go."<eos> And if you're thinking that at the start, then you're done.<eos> Mentally, you are done.<eos> This is what doing discovery physics means.<eos> This is what doing discovery means.<eos> Why do people have curiosity?<eos> Why do we care about how distant parts of the universe, things that happened billion years ago, like the big bang, why do we find them that interesting?<eos> It doesn't affect what we do day-to-day.<eos> But nevertheless, once you have curiosity, you can't control it.
It's been on the market a couple months.<eos> I'm gonna track the owners, see if they know anything.<eos> Got any new info on that corpse we found in the priest's basement?<eos> No DNA, dental, or fingerprint matches.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Priest is sticking to the story too.<eos> All right.<eos> Same person who took him, took those girls. I'm sure of it.<eos> Wearing out the tape, I guess.<eos> I watch it every day after breakfast.
Evasive maneuvers!<eos> Get us to Earth! Right now!<eos> Captain! Stop!<eos> Everybody on this ship is going to die if you don't let me speak to him.<eos> Uhura, hail him.<eos> Sir. It's me.<eos> It's Carol.<eos> What are you doing on that ship?<eos> I heard what you said.<eos> That you made a mistake and now you're doing everything you can to fix it.
Give me your phone!<eos> Come on, this place is making us very sick, okay?<eos> - We need to get out.<eos> - I don't feel good.<eos> I know.<eos> We need to get out.<eos> - What about the movie?<eos> - Come on, we need to get outside.<eos> - I lost my shoe!<eos> - Get it later.
The house... wonderful memories and a great life... that... that we all had there at some point, and... [gulping]<eos> You have to sell in order to stay here.<eos> [Max] It's not your house... to sell!<eos> You put my name on the deed.<eos> That was a convenience.<eos> I did what had to be done.<eos> [Max] You selfish little putz!<eos> [Chris] Okay...<eos> Great to see you, as always.<eos> [Max] Who'd you sell it to?
My mum's in.<eos> If she hears that I'm doing a TV show out in the garden, she'll go mad.<eos> Cunty Bunty, Cunty Bunty, how does your big minge grow?<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Hello, Bunty.<eos> It's Frank Sidebottom here.<eos> I've had just about enough of you.<eos> He told us, right, that you have got a big hairy fanny, though, Bunty.<eos> - You're pathetic!<eos> - That you... like to take it up the bum, Bunty.
I just... I get this shooting pain in my leg.<eos> Comes and goes.<eos> Always puts me in a bad mood.<eos> Try it.<eos> Ah, you got to be kidding me.<eos> God damn it!<eos> Patience.<eos> I'm trying to revive car.<eos> I don't want to have to do the same for you.<eos> Well, I should've just towed it in.
He wants to get in!<eos> We need more branches.<eos> Over here!<eos> Come on.<eos> We've got to close the gap!<eos> I think I can hear him breathing.<eos> No, that's you.<eos> You can't keep them hidden from me forever, Mkhulu.<eos> Shh. I can smell your fear.<eos> I can almost taste it.
- Get out! Go on!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Come on.<eos> Somebody told me that you like to play music.<eos> Johann would be very proud.<eos> Now you shall die by Raziel's sword.<eos> Stop!<eos> Or I'll drop it!<eos> You don't want to do that.<eos> Don't give it to him, Clary.
No, I'll lead the way.<eos> Simon said you might take some convincing.<eos> He tell you I got a wife?<eos> He said she left you and that you needed to get your mind off it.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Feel to me like you already have.<eos> Shoot!<eos> Where's my watch?<eos> The rain'll ruin it!<eos> Help me find it, please!
Crap!<eos> Ronny!<eos> It's up to you, Jobryeth.<eos> Eric, the gem combined with signing, that's what makes the magic work, right?<eos> Fuck if I know, man.<eos> Are you a wizard or not?<eos> Yes, yes, yes.<eos> It's definitely the catalyst.<eos> I think this song will work-<eos> - Fire it up.
Did I hear you ain't comin' to the game?<eos> Somethin' about "You don't want to drive five hours... to see a football game?"<eos> Well, I'm not a big croud guy. Plus, someone has to stay behind, to keep the peace.<eos> You going boating?<eos> I'm undercover.<eos> Sure, Ray. You blend right in.<eos> See you Sunday.<eos> Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. What about your car?<eos> It's parked in a fire zone.<eos> Well... if there's a fire... go ahead and move it.
Go in.<eos> Now.<eos> Wait and see.<eos> History rewards the bold.<eos> I'm not going to be the man who waited and saw.<eos> Get me the G.l. Joes.<eos> Star One Flight commander separating for drop.<eos> All right, listen up!<eos> That nuke cannot have gone far.<eos> Once we have it, we will disarm it en route to the L.Z.!
'Cause let me tell you, if the tables were turned, your brother would have found your killer and brought me his head on a fucking platter!<eos> And you just sit there thinking he got what he deserved!<eos> Fuck you.<eos> I don't want to talk about it anymore.<eos> Do you mind if I smoke?<eos> You can keep that dress if you want to.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> Why do you let her treat you like that?<eos> 'Cause she's my mother.<eos> Now if you don't want that dress, take it off.
Was that for me?<eos> No.<eos> Some of the smoke got in my eyes.<eos> Right.<eos> Wow, you fooled everybody.<eos> That was your greatest trick yet.<eos> That was just the opening act.<eos> Let this be the final word.<eos> Your prophecy is dead.<eos> Like the king who spoke it, and the wizard who tried to fulfil it.
And your grandad said: "Then son, you will be whatever you want to be."<eos> And he hugged him.<eos> I remember the king's words the day your grandad was knighted:<eos> "Carry this sword with strength,<eos> "and prepare your heart for goodness.<eos> "Never use it to do harm in anger.<eos> "but always to defend the good and the just."<eos> Thanks.<eos> So, if you want to be a knight, you will need a quest.<eos> Find grandfather's sword and bring it home.
The throne is mine.<eos> Thanks, that also belongs to me.<eos> Tomorrow this land will have a new king.<eos> Who won't let anything get in his way.<eos> You'll never sit on the throne.<eos> My grandfather stopped you then and I'll stop you now.<eos> Everything that's happened is all your father's fault.<eos> You liar!<eos> - That sword belongs to my family<eos> - So why don't you come and get it?
The quarrel is between our masters.<eos> The quarrel is between our masters and us, their men.<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> Put down your sword!<eos> You know not what you do.<eos> Hold up there.<eos> Turn now, Benvolio, and look upon thy death.<eos> Tybalt, I do but keep the peace.<eos> Put up your sword or manage it to part these men with me.
I will.<eos> Nurse, you go with her.<eos> See her safely home.<eos> Till tonight.<eos> Which is a year away.<eos> Only a year?<eos> You do not love me, then?<eos> I pray you, good Mercutio, let's go.<eos> The Capulets are out.<eos> You are like the man who snatches off his sword, on a tavern's table, lays it down forthwith and vows to have no need of it.

to stop just surviving and live a little.<eos> They soon became disillusioned.<eos> The Irish were making fun of Pa's bad back.<eos> Our big lad grabbed the crate with Labelle and Tanguay.<eos> He caught the Irish up in 2 seconds.<eos> There were 4 carrot tops to a crate.<eos> And only 3 of us!<eos> Tanguay was too tired to carry on. He let go, fell over and crushed Labelle.<eos> The Irish finished first.<eos> But Big Bro got up, grabbed the crate and launched it right over 3 other crates.
And he's Irish.<eos> Every race of people has fools.<eos> Your place is here.<eos> - With us.<eos> - Ah yes...<eos> We'll all end up in a pine coffin.<eos> I know that nothing's gonna happen for me here.<eos> You'll be proud of me.<eos> Find your path, my big boy.<eos> Follow it.
I asked if you'd have lunch with me.<eos> Marshall, you were drunk.<eos> We all were.<eos> You say things...<eos> Mmm-hmm, and what if I meant it?<eos> Isn't Tyra waiting for you somewhere?<eos> If she asks, we're just talking about the piece in the paper.<eos> Haven't read it yet.<eos> Don't.<eos> What I'm gonna do is cut out the picture and keep it in my wallet.
I study them.<eos> And unlike most people, I wanna see one alive and up close one day.<eos> Trust me you don't want to.<eos> So that's your Research Division?<eos> Things have changed.<eos> We're not an army anymore, Mr. Becket.<eos> We're the resistance.<eos> Welcome to the Shatterdome.<eos> War clock.<eos> We reset it after every Kaiju attack. Keeps everyone focused.
Let me mull over that offer of cheap and meaningless sex.<eos> Cheap and meaningless, maybe, but not time-consuming.<eos> We should be getting there a few minutes early.<eos> So, sit back, relax.<eos> We should be in the Big Easy soon.<eos> Appreciate you flying with us today.<eos> So, what's in it for Tressler, besides the money?<eos> Ego.<eos> Okay, pick your card.<eos> Look at it, put it in the deck, and tell me.
This other guy, Maximillian...<eos> I am not interested in a history lesson on magic at this moment.<eos> If you want to keep playing into their hands, go for it.<eos> I'm just trying to understand how they think.<eos> You think I'm playing in their hands, do you?<eos> I don't know how any of that is gonna go against this.<eos> This what?<eos> This magic?<eos> Lionel Shrike.<eos> In Central Park, he has a guy pick a card and sign it.
Then throw the key into the Seine.<eos> All day they do this.<eos> Mothers, lovers, old men.<eos> Watching the key sink into the water and their secret is locked away forever.<eos> Real and, at the same time, magical.<eos> So, do you really think it's possible there's a fifth Horseman?<eos> Yeah.<eos> There is a legend of a secret order born in ancient Egypt called<eos> "The Eye."<eos> It is said they perfected sleight of hand to steal food from the Pharaohs and give it to the slaves.
I'm sorry.<eos> I was an asshole.<eos> I was drunk.<eos> I'm at a loss.<eos> You know, when Merritt said I hardly spent any time away from the desk, he was right.<eos> I'm a researcher.<eos> That's what I do best.<eos> So what's this all about?<eos> Supposedly, if you buy into it,<eos> The Eye are the keepers of real magic and the protectors of those who practice it.
So you're surprised at yourself?<eos> You're not afraid of being touched anymore?<eos> Please don't spoil it.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Everyone said you were crazy.<eos> But they have no idea, do they?<eos> I wanna go home now.<eos> Let me go.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You opened this door, and now you're gonna walk through it.
Yes.<eos> Wilford the merciful.<eos> Call him.<eos> He won't come here, he won't leave his engine.<eos> We're gonna rip you into little pieces, he still won't come?<eos> When we control the water and turn that off, he'll have to come.<eos> Turn off the water?<eos> Well, you'll only be condemning your own people.<eos> The water comes from the front.<eos> The nose of the train, it breaks up the snow and ice and turns it into water.
I'm not a fucking idiot! I know.<eos> The airlock.<eos> It's Brunel.<eos> Lock the door!<eos> Lock the door!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Seal it up.<eos> Don't let them get out!<eos> - He's bleeding.<eos> - Need to seal it.
Open the panel!<eos> - OK?<eos> - Go, go.<eos> Open the fucking panel!<eos> Move, move!<eos> Get out of here.<eos> We'll follow.<eos> Why won't it open?<eos> The failsafe is set to lock in case of a breach.<eos> I have to reboot it to get it open.
- This is my brother Shane.<eos> - Hey, Shane.<eos> - He just learned that.<eos> - Charming.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We can study in my room.<eos> - Lead the way.<eos> This is - This is really nice.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I try to keep it clean.
And it would be really inexpensive and awesome and-<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think that's great.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I did it.<eos> - What?<eos> - Talked to my mom.<eos> I walked in and said...<eos> "lt's my life, and I'm not gonna let you stand in the way of it."
And now they've succeeded in contaminating their own fucking blood. Never mind the water.<eos> Yeah, well If we're gonna have a litany in all the zombie atrocities in history we would be here until the sun comes up.<eos> The sun is coming up.<eos> Should I tell you again about the 'Spooky action at a distance'?<eos> Einstein's theory of entanglement.<eos> I love the way you tell it.<eos> But not now.<eos> We don't wanna be up all day.<eos> Could you tell me how old this guitar is?<eos> I think is an L2, but... I've never been able to date it exactly.
Hey, Anna, do you want a cup?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> You sure?<eos> I like you being here with us.<eos> And coming back... now.<eos> You saw Mousey, right?<eos> So you didn't poison those girls?<eos> Of course, not.<eos> Your prints were all over the teapot.<eos> Because I picked it up once or twice.
Where you going? - Are you serious?<eos> Look, look, look.<eos> Okay.<eos> I know what this is about, and I get it.<eos> All right? We're gonna split the $500,000.<eos> Evenly.<eos> Betwixt the four of us.<eos> - You guys get what I'm saying here?<eos> - "Pfft!" Like you're from... Right?<eos> That's a lot of video games, kiddo. All right, Casey, you can buy a house, and run away from it.
Oh, shit! Fuck, man!<eos> You guys are fuckin' mean, man.<eos> Yeah, so we just wanna borrow your gun for a couple of hours and we'll bring it right back.<eos> Get the fuck outta here.<eos> What the fuck, man?<eos> I can't believe that fuck-mouth slammed the door in my face.<eos> I should've kicked his ass.<eos> That's what I should've fucking done.<eos> - Yep. - Dumb motherfucker.<eos> Hey... didn't we borrow his lawn mower one time and then we sold it instead of taking it back to him?
Now, you wanna tell me where you got this ring?<eos> You wanna tell me where you got it?<eos> This is my damn house.<eos> You don't just show up demanding shit around here.<eos> All right, how about this?<eos> I'll tell you where I got it and then you tell me where you got it.<eos> Deal?<eos> Deal.<eos> Like I said, this ring was taken from me a long time ago.<eos> But where I got it today was in a pawn shop.
Then they kill him, they skin him, they boil him, they make a canoe out of him.<eos> And finally, the chief walks up to the wop.<eos> He says, "What do you want?"<eos> The Italian says, "I want a fork."<eos> The chief says, "What do you want a fork for?<eos> "You don't want something else?"<eos> The Italian says, "No, give me a fork!"<eos> He says, "We don't have a fork!"<eos> He says, "Find me a fucking fork!"<eos> So the chief goes out, finds him a fork, he brings it over, hands it to him.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Is this your firearm?<eos> It's never been fired.<eos> Is it registered?<eos> It's eight years old.<eos> Answer the question, is it registered?<eos> You're a funny man, you know that?<eos> Yeah, I got a sense of humor, sure.<eos> Yeah, I noticed.<eos> Unregistered firearm, take it downtown.
Good.<eos> It's official, no more pictures.<eos> Good night.<eos> Shit.<eos> I do a job that requires me to be very focus.<eos> It's not going to be possible for you and i to go out together. To a restaurant anywhere, there would be millions of people swarming all over us.<eos> That maybe your life, but it can't be mine.<eos> That's pretty clear, then.<eos> I'm sorry, i think you're wonderful.<eos> If there was a way. I'd take it.
Did i apply for a job in Boston?<eos> Funny i don't remember it.<eos> Things have got ahead of themselves.<eos> Funnier still, i actually seemed to have got the job.<eos> We talked about living abroad.<eos> But we weren't really talking about living abroad.<eos> You're a wonderful doctor... I was simply using my connection.<eos> I don't want anything from you.<eos> I've worked long and hard to get myself a life...<eos> Don't go and reorganize it without asking.
Crank it shut. This is a church.<eos> I know it's a church.<eos> I have a brain, you know.<eos> You know why I call you Pooh Bear?<eos> Because I'm so cuddly.<eos> Because his head is full of stuffin'<eos> Now listen to me, odd one.<eos> I don't want you going back to that creepy room again.<eos> It doesn't exist anymore.<eos> Well, don't go looking for it hoping it'll come back.
He's awake!<eos> But it was nothing they couldn't stitch back together.<eos> Karla told me that the chief had come through just fine... and somehow managed to spin Fungus Bob's corpse... into a bizarre cover story that kept my secret a secret.<eos> An FBI expert on television said that if you hadn't gotten those explosives out of there, at least 500 or 600 people would've died, for sure.<eos> They told me events at the Green Moon Mall had made headlines everywhere.<eos> But I didn't want to read or see anything about it.<eos> According to Eckles... he and Varner started a satanic cult when they were teenagers.<eos> One night, they killed a man and realized they enjoyed it.<eos> So they kept at it, eventually joining the police force for better cover.<eos> They met Robertson and Goss and came up with a plan... to infiltrate a small town and then slowly kill it.
The deal is it.<eos> And right now that's in my hands, not yours.<eos> We both know you're still trying to recover from that explosion at the plant 18 months ago.<eos> - Red! - Mm-mm.<eos> Took 11 lives.<eos> Your liability went sky high and the publicity practically crippled you.<eos> Red...<eos> Your profits are down 22 percent from last quarter.<eos> Where did you get that information?<eos> I want to buy your refinery, and you need to sell it.
- Yeah, tell me.<eos> I'm choking you with the cat.<eos> Tell me. Keep telling me.<eos> I've got its tail. I'm choking you with the cat's tail.<eos> Yeah, you are.<eos> Oh, fuck, tell me!<eos> I'm choking you, and its tail is around your neck.<eos> - And it's so tight around your neck.<eos> - Yeah, it is. It's so tight, yes!<eos> I'm pulling it, I'm pulling it. The cat's dead.
You told him that?<eos> They didn't want the Jews to make money. They didn't want the Italians to make money.<eos> They definitely don't want the blacks to make money.<eos> After the oil embargo, gasoline crisis, the hijackings, the Olympics' they don't want to see Arabs make money, trust me, not on our soil.<eos> And, I don't know, you can tell him this in your own way.<eos> I've been in the casino business 40 years' it's scrutinized more carefully than any other business.<eos> Carmine made this legal, but we must be careful, or they'll take it away.<eos> So, Mr. Tellegio, how do you think we should approach this? What do you think?<eos> What do you want to do?<eos> Well, if you want to get the gaming license and keep it, we have to make our principal investor here, the sheik, an American citizen.
You won't.<eos> What you will do is submit your resignation and take this week to clear up your affairs, and then I don't ever want to see you in this building again.<eos> He's going to Yale.<eos> Jesse Bolton.<eos> The guidance counselor called me.<eos> We never had a shot at him.<eos> Yale?<eos> Well, that's not the point.<eos> I assume you'll be standing by the offer.<eos> I don't see how we can rescind it without the whole thing blowing up in our faces.
It's secrete an imperceptible amount of pheromones into the air.<eos> And all you can think about is when it gonna kill you.<eos> Senshi!<eos> She sees you, kid.<eos> Attention on deck!<eos> Kitai, back to your seat now.<eos> Rangers, go red-con one.<eos> Secure all cargo!<eos> Behind your seat there's a life-suit.<eos> Put it on now.
Kitai, inject yourself directly into your heart with the first stage.<eos> Do it now.<eos> Now the second.<eos> ASAP.<eos> To your left, Kitai.<eos> Left!<eos> I can't feel my hand.<eos> Dad, I can't feel my hands.<eos> Press it into the ground.<eos> Roll over on it and press it into the ground, Kitai.
I'd say he stole it.<eos> That's why I need a new one.<eos> Where are you off to now?<eos> Sitting down.<eos> He even sleeps with that stupid letter.<eos> He's memorized it word for word.<eos> I didn't think he could memorize anything anymore.<eos> Hey, what's with this casserole?<eos> Oh, it's lasagna.<eos> It's still good, take it.
You can switch me the noise of the volcano?<eos> The noise of the volcano?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I beg you.<eos> And the other 50%?<eos> Aaron is one?<eos> That is the mystery with this syndrome.<eos> You will not know until it has 30 or 35 years... it will be completely blind.<eos> Aaron has a remarkable mind.<eos> It stores information and translates it in his own way, it is a gift.
- Yes, why?<eos> - Police Miramount.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Oxygen, we need her alive!<eos> Why keep them alive, can produce thousand crones as this bitch!<eos> Dirty whore!<eos> It is a beautiful old lady!<eos> No surgery, no nothing. impeccable!<eos> It is not manufactured!<eos> We need it, keep it alive.
It is not a chemical cocktail.<eos> It is a kind... eraser which removes all influences a second chemical.<eos> And the truth... immediately arises.<eos> And where is it?<eos> It's like cyanide capsules the Nazis,<eos> in case of surrender.<eos> When I left the old world, I took one.<eos> It was my compensation from Miramount Nagasaki is what I asked them after 20 years of work.<eos> This small capsule.<eos> I want it.
in case of surrender.<eos> When I left the old world, I took one.<eos> It was my compensation from Miramount Nagasaki is what I asked them after 20 years of work.<eos> This small capsule.<eos> I want it.<eos> If your son comes in your absence?<eos> And if the other side?<eos> This is more likely.<eos> That's all I have left.<eos> If you take it, you go, you leave me.
Yes.<eos> Some do, but that's not the point.<eos> You and I are going to find this spider before they do.<eos> Come on. Let's do it.<eos> Wicked.<eos> The five-mile radius should be enough.<eos> Let's get some eyes out there.<eos> Any sign?<eos> Containment is our priority right now.<eos> We have to neutralize the target before somebody out there sees it.
- We can't let them do this.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> It's impossible that one judge in California can make it all disappear.<eos> It's out now.<eos> Well, remember what Solzhenitsyn said.<eos> "No one can bar the road to truth."<eos> And Solzhenitsyn didn't even have Twitter.<eos> I mean, whoever thought that we'd need extra servers... to fight censorship attacks from the bastion of free speech.<eos> I sent leaks to our mirror sites. You should...<eos> Having fun making history instead of reading about it?
But to be honest, the court of public opinion... has already ruled in our favor.<eos> Some French hackers donated domains. Mmm.<eos> Send the links to Bellman, he'll blast the LISTSERV.<eos> Yeah, no.<eos> But, with an organization the size and scale of WikiLeaks... grassroots support is vital.<eos> Move the U.S. primaries to page three to make room for the Diana inquest.<eos> Yes, yes, yes.<eos> Diana still sells newspapers.<eos> Can't afford reporters?<eos> Grab a story off the wire... give it a little scrub, drop it in the paper.
That is possibly the greatest mistake.<eos> A WikiLeaks movie?<eos> Which one?<eos> Oh, that one. Mmm.<eos> Well, that one is based on the two worst books... full of lies and distortion, like all bad propaganda.<eos> Look, urn... A WikiLeaks movie...<eos> It's more like the "anti-WikiLeaks" movie.<eos> If you want to know the truth... no one is going to tell you the truth.<eos> They're only going to tell you their version.<eos> So, if you want the truth... you have to seek it out for yourself.
Really? Really?<eos> That floor in which you live ...<eos> I paid in cash.<eos> I rented fichaste the day for me.<eos> Registration tell I was still at work.<eos> Pay cash week .<eos> You know what name I rented ?<eos> When the fucking Oscar Ramirez.<eos> The box is there now.<eos> Cops find it , and think that they took the job to access key that opens .
And I have also grown belly.<eos> ?<eos> Nine .<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> I have special customers.<eos> ? Want to earn extra money?<eos> Ie if you want to work here she will have to work .<eos> How much is there?<eos> Nothing, unless you have the key.<eos> You must return it to the company.
Really?<eos> Because I've got a feeling that I don't really care.<eos> Gosh, don't look so wounded.<eos> Listen, there are generals, and there are foot soldiers.<eos> And you should feel lucky that you even made it into the army at all.<eos> Just try not to screw up anything too badly while I'm gone.<eos> Let's go.<eos> "Cursed blade shall reap."<eos> "Cursed blade shall reap."<eos> What good is a prophecy if you can't even understand it?
Aren't you just a little ray of sunshine?<eos> Heads up!<eos> Shell crusher, two o' clock!<eos> All right, people, you know the drill. Tuck and roll!<eos> Can't tuck.<eos> I can't tuck!<eos> Theo, tuck and roll!<eos> We've been over this. I don't tuck and roll.<eos> You have a shell for a reason.<eos> Use it.

Bandoloni!<eos> Ange Pietri!<eos> A letter from Port Said!<eos> César, it's heavy.<eos> So?<eos> César.<eos> It's from Marius.<eos> It says so on the back.<eos> So?<eos> César, read it.

A bit old but he spoils Fanny so much -<eos> Ali's well that ends well.<eos> So you don't regret the marriage?<eos> No, not anymore.<eos> True, she loved your son but he preferred to sail.<eos> So let him sail, the fool.<eos> - Where is he now?<eos> - Marius?<eos> I'm not sure. Three weeks ago, he was off of India.<eos> I had a letter but I haven't read it yet.
You're not a loser anymore!<eos> Good for you.<eos> And who's that right there? Is that...<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's tiny.<eos> I mean, huh, right?<eos> A lot of questions.<eos> There he is! Dead zombie motherfucker.<eos> Stop that fucking lawnmower!<eos> Stop it!
At last a laugh.<eos> There. I am changing you.<eos> Send those ones to me.<eos> I'll take them with me to Africa.<eos> You're going to Africa?<eos> A valley in Sierra Leone where there is no water.<eos> When do you leave?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> So this is the end of my crazy patch, Joey.<eos> And I've decided I want to end it with you.
We had to go all the way round to the other side.<eos> We need to leave here now.<eos> We have to wait for Nick!<eos> She told us not to touch his stuff.<eos> Her stupid son's gone to war, and he's not coming back.<eos> We have to go now.<eos> It's dangerous here.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look at me. We're gonna get through this, okay?<eos> You just gotta take that bad thing, you take it, you put it in a box, you close the lid, you look up and you focus on your goal, okay?
But it turns out that he's a true believer.<eos> But you... [ chuckles ]<eos> Why, you're the brains.<eos> Cassie: What's that?<eos> Boyd: What's it look like?<eos> Cassie: Like the 30 pieces of silver the high priest caiaphas gave to Judas iscariot.<eos> Boyd: Well, think of it as a donation from a concerned parishioner who'd like to see your brother shift focus away from me and mine.<eos> Cassie: I'm afraid you've misjudged me, Mr. crowder.<eos> I would never tell my brother how to spread the good word.<eos> Boyd: How about where to spread it?
Eve:<eos> I don't know.<eos> [ Yells, whimpering ]<eos> [ Groans ]<eos> Where's drew?<eos> Eve: [ Crying ] I swear, until an hour ago, I thought he was dead.<eos> I swear.<eos> I swear.<eos> [ Grunts ]<eos> Now, I'm-a give you one more chance, and then I'm gonna piss on that sock before I put it back.
-Shit !<eos> -Oh , shit !<eos> Open itin!<eos> Quick!<eos> Join !<eos> -Holly!<eos> -Close the door , close the fucking door !<eos> Trábala !<eos> The lock is on the other side!<eos> Help me to hold it closed !
We've got four teams on overwatch, sniper-spotters in roosts north and South of the target.<eos> Just keep all your men out of sight.<eos> When they drive that truck in here, I want to come crashing down on them like the walls of Jericho.<eos> Hobbs, I just caught this one disabling the perimeter security system.<eos> Your house is compromised.<eos> What are you suggesting?<eos> I ain't suggesting.<eos> We follow protocol, we move the component out.<eos> Shaw thinks it's here.<eos> We're going to get it out of here before he arrives.
I just got word they caught one of Shaw's men at the base.<eos> It's time.<eos> Something is not right.<eos> He wanted us to find that guy.<eos> Think about it.<eos> At Interpol, you were face-to-face with him.<eos> Brian, so what are you saying?<eos> Braga said the only way you get near Shaw is if he wants you to.<eos> Tej, where's that component?<eos> They're moving it to a secure location.
All right. Thanks, sugar.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Try to stay out of trouble. Okay, darling?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - All right, sugar.<eos> - Still calling us "sugar," huh?<eos> - You know it.<eos> - Cara lose that little tooth yet?<eos> - Nope.<eos> Lou wants to pull it but I won't let him.
Casey, sweetheart, does the trunk smell like it's a new trunk or an old one?<eos> - It kind of smells like old.<eos> - Okay, good.<eos> - Yeah, there's, like, work stuff.<eos> - Okay, honey.<eos> - Can you see the tail lights?<eos> - What?<eos> In older cars there may be access to tail lights.<eos> Look for the red glow, okay?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, I see it.
It's not possible.<eos> You were at the villa 63 times.<eos> 36 during the day and 27 at night, excluding the night of the accident.<eos> - One, four, four.<eos> - One, four, four? The telephone number for the ambulance.<eos> The villa is free now.<eos> If you're interested, I'll get you a good deal.<eos> - Who owns it?<eos> - Me. But I don't know what to do with it.<eos> I often rent it out to cinema people.
I'm a soldier with a document eidetic memory the army has me on tape reciting the first 92 thousand decimal places of Pi.<eos> I'm a housekeeper, who is such a good and kind person that the angels will bow their heads as I walk through the gates of heaven, if heaven exist.<eos> And if not, I'm just a nice guy who clean rooms.<eos> Are we seriously considering this?<eos> We need more boys.<eos> He is a house keeper.<eos> No nation succeeds without the strong working class he's strong, I say we let in some strength.<eos> I'm a published poet who...<eos> I'm afraid his slot is for me.<eos> Why would we give it to you now?
Cmon, man.<eos> Okay, are you fucking with me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Alicia, dance to this song.<eos> Okay, dance like a whore.<eos> What? God, how many piscos did you guys give her?<eos> Okay, Alicia, calm down.<eos> Look how terrified Brink is.<eos> Okay, now give Agustin a blowjob.<eos> Brink, why dont you just do it yourself?
How's it coming?<eos> I'll get there well before Christmas.<eos> I know we're supposed to do this whole father-daughter kumbaya on a stick thing, but it just doesn't work that way.<eos> I'm gonna sit down.<eos> Okay.<eos> I know.<eos> Mom wasn't the only one you cheated on.<eos> I know.<eos> I still don't know how Bebe sleeps at night in a house you and Mom built together.<eos> And the decent thing would have been to just sell it, or burn the place down.
- Yes.<eos> - You... - Yeah? - Think that I still love you?<eos> Really, you don't?<eos> - Keep going.<eos> - Right, right. And yes, I would rather gouge out my eyeballs with hot spoons than cause you pain again.<eos> And yes, I will keep you on an alabaster pedestal.<eos> Words.<eos> And yes, I will love you and only you for the rest of my life, if you will allow me the honor of becoming your husband.<eos> Where the fuck did you get that ring?<eos> I've had it around for a while, six years or so.
But I have a friend who say me it was fantastic.<eos> I don't know why I say Dune. I can say Don Quixote or I can said Hamlet.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> I say Dune.<eos> Dune is this sprawling space epic that focuses on the planet Arrakis. .. ...a desert planet, where this spice, melange, is found.<eos> This consciousness-expanding drug which is one of the most important commodities in the universe.<eos> This makes Dune into a planet of extraordinary strategic importance.<eos> Almost, I guess, the galactic version of Afghanistan.<eos> Paul Atreides is a young noble.<eos> Paul gets cast out of his house and leads a revolution of the Fremen the local natives on Arrakis, to take over the planet from the evil, colonial Harkonnens, who are controlling it and to sort of return power of the spice to the people.
But this idiotic love...<eos> I felt humiliated by it... And all the dishonesty that follows.<eos> The erotic is about saying yes.<eos> Love appeals to the lowest instincts, wrapped up in lies.<eos> How do you say yes when you mean no and vice versa?<eos> I'm ashamed of what I became, but it was beyond my control.<eos> You know what you're doing now?<eos> No, what am I doing?<eos> You're defending your personality.<eos> I thought the point was to reveal it.
I took the same walk again and again.<eos> Right turn after the gatehouse, and right again by the ash tree, which has the most beautiful leaves in the forest.<eos> And further on past the lady with her poodle and the old man on the bench.<eos> I couldn't free myself of the image of Jerome and his careless elegance.<eos> And during this time, when I was with other men, I forbade them to touch my body with their hands.<eos> And soon I stopped having sex altogether.<eos> I tried to meet him all the time.<eos> I found out where he lived, but of course never dared ring his doorbell.<eos> I worked for a long time on a letter in which I told him about my feelings for him.<eos> A month would pass before I had built up enough courage to deliver it.

Isn't this Jerome's office?<eos> I'm happy to say that this never has been and never will be Jerome's office.<eos> But my nephew has been standing in for me while I've been unwell.<eos> Was that a letter for him?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Give it to me and I will make sure he gets it.
I might have known it would be red.<eos> It's pink.<eos> I can see your dirty pillows.<eos> Everyone will.<eos> Breasts, Mama.<eos> Breasts.<eos> You have them and every woman has them.<eos> Take off that dress, Carrie.<eos> No.<eos> Take it off and we'll burn it together and pray for forgiveness.
- Give me the keys.<eos> What are you gonna do with Chow?<eos> I just wanna talk to him.<eos> Move.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> End of conversation.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Leslie Chow is madness.<eos> You don't talk to madness.<eos> If you're lucky, you trap it in the trunk of your limo and you kill it.
There's no one else in the house.<eos> - You've already had a bath.<eos> - That was two days ago.<eos> I am dirty, I stink.<eos> You mustn't become a problem.<eos> I've never been a problem to anyone.<eos> Where's Mummy?<eos> Mummy's downstairs.<eos> Do you know the story of the white child that floats above the clouds?<eos> Shall I tell it some time?
- I must?<eos> Not must, but may.<eos> It is good to eat when you're working.<eos> It's rolls.<eos> They dry out quickly in the sun.<eos> If you don't want to eat, tell me and I'll take it away again.<eos> I'm taking it back again.<eos> If you're hungry, let me know.<eos> Shall I leave the water bottle behind?<eos> I'll put it in the shade.

That night, their ranks grew.<eos> Every survivor nearby came by instinct.<eos> On the first floor there were sailors, mobilized factory workers and a few sappers.<eos> They set up in Apartment 6 where the large Kulikov family had lived.<eos> Now there was a machine gun there.<eos> The fascist bitch works. Ha-ha-ha.<eos> Come here. Shoot some Germans with it.<eos> I was joking.<eos> Give me your canteens.<eos> Will I get it back?
Some kind of artillery.<eos> I have a beautiful wife.<eos> I chose her from the village for her beauty.<eos> My village is far away, near Bryansk.<eos> We made a life.<eos> We were happy.<eos> I took care of her.<eos> I bought her a kerchief, some felt boots.<eos> She liked me to stroke herhead.<eos> I'd come home and sit by her, she'd put her head on my lap, and I'd stroke it.
Holiday weekend.<eos> Breakfast?<eos> You have to try one.<eos> Hey, give me a three-quarter-inch ratchet wrench.<eos> Ratchet wrench.<eos> That day, Frank changed the oil in the car and replaced the fuse for the blinkers.<eos> Then he replaced the filter on the furnace.<eos> He checked out the cord of firewood that just got delivered and informed my mom that the guy was shorting her.<eos> Then he washed the floor and waxed it.<eos> Then you rotate the ball. Grip it loose. Two fingers up top, thumb on the bottom.
- Niki.<eos> Mi scusi...<eos> Tu sei Niki Lauda?<eos> - Actually, we do, yeah.<eos> It's my honour, Niki, please.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - My car is your car.<eos> On one condition, though.<eos> It's a piece of shit. It's dog shit.<eos> But if you drive it, you make my life, Niki, eh?
The sparrow took a last chance with the pine tree, who said:<eos> I can't offer you much protection, I only have needles that let in draft<eos> But my answer is ... Yes.<eos> Overjoyed, the sparrow took refuge there and you know what?<eos> He survived the winter.<eos> The children returned and wept tears of joy.<eos> Upon seeing this, the Creator decided to punish all the other trees for their selfishness.<eos> From that day on, every tree lost it's leaves in winter, except the pine, who saved the sparrow.<eos> My grandmother told me this story.<eos> Had you ever heard it before?
Who's game for a bit of amusement?<eos> Me!<eos> Me! I'm so bored.<eos> Well, well, my cupcake,<eos> Mrs. Wattlesbrook has only gone and surpassed herself and has completed a brilliant theatrical.<eos> You don't look like you could read or write.<eos> It's just a trifle.<eos> Now, there are six parts.<eos> Three sets of lovers.<eos> And I thought, give us something to pass the time until the ball, we could rehearse it and perform it for our illustrious and distinguished authoress.
Don't worry, Lockwood, I'll let them go.<eos> Right into my super-sized Food Bar machine.<eos> Food Bars?<eos> Food Bars? You're going to turn them into Food Bars?<eos> Yes, Food Bars.<eos> The lifeblood of my company.<eos> I learned your FLDSMDFR food is far more delicious than "food" food.<eos> So using your foodimals as ingredients would make my products super-delicious!<eos> I had to have your invention.<eos> Unfortunately, I couldn't find it.
Yes, something like that.<eos> That's not necessary, we can take care of ourselves.<eos> Bianca?<eos> Alright.<eos> We'll come by to visit you often to make sure everything's going well.<eos> You must know you are not alone.<eos> Shouldn't it be night already?<eos> Yes, it should be.<eos> Strange...<eos> All this light, do you see it?
Accidents release so much energy, they modify the universe.<eos> You believe that?<eos> How strange!<eos> It's normal.<eos> Well, not normal, but it happens.<eos> But...<eos> Is the light real?<eos> Or can we see in the dark?<eos> Both.<eos> Light is here, but only you can see it.
Atoms for Peace.<eos> We've had 50 years now of water reactors, 400 of them, roughly, all over the world. And they've produced a hell-of-a-lot of waste that we didn't anticipate.<eos> You know, you've mentioned a 100,000 years of stuff that you gotta keep isolated from the rest of the world, it's enough to scare a lot of people.<eos> There was perhaps a price we paid for commercialization, in the sense that we didn't look ahead.<eos> Nuclear power was developed as a kind of a boutique energy source by utilities executives who really didn't know much about it.<eos> I talked to people who said, "Well, I heard about it on the golf course from the guy who runs the plant down the road.<eos> He's going to build one, and so I thought I should too."<eos> The first commercial nuclear power plant, that was built in the United States, was built in Shippingport, Pennsylvania.<eos> It was a modified version of a large submarine reactor.<eos> One of the major reasons the power company wanted it, was because there was a lot of coal pollution in Pittsburgh. And nuclear energy looked to people to be, as it is, a clean form of energy.
In regions that don't have electricity, or very little electricity, the life span is much shorter.<eos> Clinics, schools, refrigeration, all of these things rely on electricity.<eos> And just a few watts make a big difference.<eos> As soon as you get electricity, you improve people's lives.<eos> Well, that's human life.<eos> First of all, we're talking about human, just quality of life.<eos> And, ah, if you look at the countries with the best quality of life, they are the countries that consume the most electricity.<eos> Rain or shine, 24 hours a day, a steady stream of power.<eos> The global south is pretty warm, they would like air conditioning.<eos> And, up 'till now, they've not been able to afford it. And now they can.
Form a single-file line, one after another.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Missile launch in T minus two minutes.<eos> - One after another.<eos> Keep your hands in the straps and hold on tight.<eos> Really?<eos> You're gonna make me kill a blind chick?<eos> I'm pretty sure they're gonna take my crown for that.<eos> That's all right.<eos> They'll just give it to the next bimbo who spreads like butter.
- Sean?<eos> - Leela?<eos> - Sean?<eos> ! - Polo!<eos> What are you doing here, Sean?<eos> I was on vacation.<eos> Repeat customer discount, free meals 'cause I brought my own peanut butter.<eos> Whole trip cost less than 600 bucks.<eos> But this is a private resort for only two people at a time.<eos> Yeah, my week is up, but the shuttle broke down and they're still trying to fix it.
When the mine caved in, the entrance was blocked by a fusion explosion.<eos> Luckily, the miners found safe haven here in the doom chamber.<eos> To rescue them, you'll simply have to fly to the sun and march in through an inferno of molten plasma.<eos> But solar plasma is, like, 10,000 degrees hot.<eos> Won't that sear our tender flesh, sealing in the juices?<eos> Oh, nonsense.<eos> You clearly weren't paying attention to what I'm about to say.<eos> To the sub-basement!<eos> You see, you'll be protected by my fermion barrier heat-exclusion spray.<eos> Watch as I demonstrate by coating some highly delicate matter, and dunking it into this molten lava.
...pause?<eos> Man, those executives are crazy.<eos> Calculon's the greatest actor ever!<eos> Thank you, Bender.<eos> I appreciate your honesty.<eos> They're showing Calculon's star on the Walk of Fame!<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> I'll always have that.<eos> Calculon was truly the has-been's has-been.<eos> And so I am proud to tear up his star and replace it with a second star for the fabulous Robert Wagner.
One of my customers already bought your friend's antenna.<eos> Oh, excuse me... Robo-Dong.<eos> Who was it?<eos> Can you give us a name?<eos> Certainly not.<eos> I could never betray a customer's privacy.<eos> All I can give you is this naked picture of him taken from my toilet cam.<eos> I'll get right to the point, Senator.<eos> You purchased our friend's... Antenna.<eos> We'd like it back.
Now I have to become a squid, too? !<eos> Aw, Sweetie, tentacles are beautiful.<eos> I mean, look at your Mother here.<eos> She's so gorgeous, you hardly even notice the tentacles.<eos> And if you're worried, you can always move down here with us.<eos> In the sewer, you'll fit right in.<eos> Sewer mail!<eos> He's single.<eos> I don't care if that operation will only delay the tentacles.<eos> Somehow, we got to find a way to pay for it.
What do the tones mean?<eos> Isn't it obvious?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Drat, I was hoping it was.<eos> Well, whatever it is, we'd better figure it out soon because that ship will reach Earth in two weeks.<eos> That's a hell of a slow ship.<eos> I know I've heard that melody before.<eos> I just can't remember where.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Perhaps we can narrow it down by seeing what part of Fry's brain becomes active when he hears it.
I have a long way to go.<eos> I don't even have the engine yet.<eos> A beautiful dream.<eos> I'm retiring. This is my last design.<eos> Artists are only creative for ten years.<eos> We engineers are no different.<eos> Live your ten years to the full.<eos> Jiro, we need to talk.<eos> - I've got a meeting.<eos> - Cancel it.
Again, we're so sorry. If...<eos> Johnny can breathe again, which makes two of us since both of his parents are lawyers.<eos> Well, that's why they overreacted.<eos> They didn't overreact.<eos> He's dying.<eos> I think it's time for this.<eos> You didn't bring the crown.<eos> Don't put the crown on him.<eos> Come on, you used to love this crown.<eos> - Yes, you did. - You wore it everywhere. - I did not.
This is how I treat all the critics.<eos> Hurry, up those ropes.<eos> Is Smurfette really worth all this?<eos> - I'm just saying. - Let's go.<eos> Not permis. - What? This is outrageous.<eos> No, I'm sorry, you will need your key card.<eos> Yes, of course, darling, my key card!<eos> Oh, dear, I've left it.<eos> Oui, I was having breakfast at Tiffany's.<eos> I'll just go back and get it.
We'll lure the beast out.<eos> Baiting won't do. You'll have to hook it.<eos> Meet me at the fridge.<eos> Thank you, Gouffé.<eos> Got it.<eos> - You always amaze me.<eos> - That's called talent.<eos> Scald it.<eos> Too late!<eos> Knock it out with tomatoes and fresh mint.
Come on, this'll be a fun bet.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> - I'm calling the cops.<eos> - My friend is outside the theater.<eos> He sees so much as one cop car pull into the lot and the ushers will have a corpse to clean up in box seat five.<eos> Now head to the left side of the stage.<eos> Now.<eos> In front of you.<eos> The top step.<eos> I see it.
No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Hey, what is wrong?<eos> What is wrong?<eos> - He threw the score out.<eos> - That's a shame.<eos> Wait!<eos> I have a copy at home.<eos> I could get someone to go get it.
Radiation is holding steady.<eos> We're at 50 millisieverts per hour...<eos> within acceptable limits.<eos> I'll check if I can see her from upstairs.<eos> It's so still out here.<eos> It's so... I don't know what the word is.<eos> - Creepy?<eos> I was going to go with "cosmically astounding."<eos> I wish I could take one of these gloves off and touch the ice.<eos> - Really feel it.
- Please... Can I put some clothes on? Yeah.<eos> Yeah. Get dressed.<eos> Hey, Hollander.<eos> Yeah, I was just gonna call you.<eos> It didn't exactly go down the way we planned it.<eos> The son of a bitch came at me. I had to kill him.<eos> There wasn't time. You know how fast he is.<eos> Only this time, I was faster.<eos> I know I kinda screwed up, OK?<eos> But I got the girl, and I'll get the truth if I have to carve it out of her.
He has no food, he has no water.<eos> - He's not one of us.<eos> We have to take care of ourselves right now.<eos> Drop your weapon!<eos> - Drop your gun.<eos> Both of you, please don't.<eos> - He's here to kill us.<eos> I'm gonna blow your fucking head off.<eos> Drop your gun.<eos> I won't put it down, you put yours down.
I thought... you knew me like I...<eos> I knew you... and...<eos> - Sharon.<eos> Please...<eos> I was hoping, maybe I was somebody else because I knew you.<eos> Please. - You stay back!<eos> Ok.<eos> - You don't fucking move or I'll shoot you and start hanging you from the next fucking tree.<eos> Watch the tape.<eos> Come on Sharon, watch it!
But you can't just sit here waiting for that poisoned arrow to kill you<eos> Captain Hu. please show us the route you mentioned.<eos> Alright.<eos> Seventh Brother. Sixth Brother. you keep guard here.<eos> Yes<eos> Fifth Brother. tend our father's wounds.<eos> Let's go<eos> Father.<eos> I'm going to pull out the arrow now.<eos> Don't touch it.
Hold on, baby.<eos> Alright. I can do this.<eos> That's right.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm back.<eos> Everything's gonna be all right, sweetheart.<eos> Yeah, everything's gonna be okay.<eos> And those problems are likely to linger, Brian.<eos> The water is a problem for, throughout the metro area.<eos> People are being told to boil it and electricity is also the problem.
No, I'm with Vic.<eos> What?<eos> I can't let you in until Alphonse is home.<eos> Alphonse is on his way.<eos> Where?<eos> In the basement.<eos> Oh, Paulie.<eos> It's Paul.<eos> Why is the alarm off?<eos> I told you that you should always have it on!
Fuck, you've been hit.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> A bit better this time.<eos> Will you be all right to drive yourself home, Beatrice?<eos> Why don't you go over and introduce yourself to him?<eos> Oh, Mom. What are you doing?<eos> You're supposed to lie down and relax.<eos> Huh?<eos> I was relaxing so much I saw a white light.<eos> Well, if you see it again, don't walk into it.
Another is that you don't care if you get out of there.<eos> You'd rather die than fail.<eos> I'll be around long enough to do what you asked me to do.<eos> I don't want you to do that.<eos> Bring me food.<eos> My mom likes to cook.<eos> It would just go to waste otherwise.<eos> I'll wedge it in between the mustard and those plastic explosives.<eos> You may not care if you get out alive, but in the meantime, you should eat.<eos> My rabbit's foot. If you don't believe in it, I'll take it back.
A sandstorm is coming!<eos> Englishman!<eos> Tie the camels together.<eos> Brothers.<eos> We lost the others.<eos> I'll find him.<eos> Help!<eos> Come on, help me!<eos> Get the rope!<eos> I can't hold it.
Master, someone died in the market.<eos> He had black boils all over.<eos> A falcon's beak can pierce a man's skull.<eos> Did you know that, Englishman?<eos> Please, Sublime One.<eos> We have heard of the pustulated corpse who expired within your city walls.<eos> We must evacuate the city immediately.<eos> The city has been spared the plague for over a century.<eos> Even my father only ever heard speak of it.<eos> But his son may live to see it with his own eyes.
Jesse, don't you see that?<eos> Quick!<eos> Quick!<eos> There!<eos> Karim.<eos> Don't look at me like that.<eos> Where I am going, there is a river of wine... and women...<eos> Women that are more beautiful than in the Shah's harem.<eos> There might even be a redhead.<eos> God gives us life... and God takes it back.
Maybe.<eos> Someday a great koran school will arise within the walls of this university.<eos> and Allah willing, I will be its dean.<eos> I bring you the word of God, father of all Seljuks.<eos> I give you his sword, keeper of the faith.<eos> The faithful of Ispahan need your help.<eos> You promised me a city in chaos, yearning for a strong ruler.<eos> As a man dying of thirst yearns for water.<eos> Under the Shah, the city of Isfahan... is adrift in the desert... decaying from vice and apostasy.<eos> But when the Seljuks have driven out both the Shah and his Jews... we can tether Ispahan to our faith... and rebuild it clean.
Are you mad?<eos> Yes I think we've all gone a little mad.<eos> Send your men away now.<eos> Someone has to punish you if you fail.<eos> You wouldn't want to not meet your beloved. [whispering]Just like that.<eos> Tonight you are the shah... and I am your subject.<eos> We don't have much time.<eos> We will take our men and place them on that ridge... to go and wait... here.<eos> It is the sins of the Jews, who take every advantage... while they shelter under the protection of that man... who permits all of their sins.<eos> Our friends the Seljuks need our help now... as they try to break down the walls of our prison from the outside... we need to clean it with fire from the inside.
-You won't last in this land.<eos> -Shit's coming out of your mouth. What?<eos> What did you say?<eos> Yeah, you.<eos> I'm talking to you, arsehole.<eos> -Talk about arseholes...<eos> -Shit, just shit, you have shit for brains.<eos> -Excuse me.<eos> -Where do you put your piss and your shit?<eos> You put it in my fucking land!
-Shit's coming out of your mouth.

Brother Kun.<eos> I'll kill Sunny and avenge your death.<eos> Oh!<eos> Another miss.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I haven't shot a gun since I graduated from the academy.<eos> If I don't practise, my shooting skills will be the office joke when I become a cop again.<eos> You know why you can't hit the bullseye?<eos> It's the way you hold your gun.<eos> You must hold it tightly, with no relaxation at the wrist.
That doesn't make it any easier.<eos> No.<eos> No, of course, it doesn't.<eos> Natural causes.<eos> I wonder.<eos> You're not suggesting foul play, I hope?<eos> It doesn't seem very likely, does it?<eos> Father, he had a heart attack.<eos> All the same...<eos> Anything could have triggered it - or perhaps nothing.
So Sir George still believes that his wife, she is alive?<eos> I think he's given up hope.<eos> He does not say so but...<eos> Of course, I've hardly seen him lately.<eos> Spends most of his time in London.<eos> He's drinking too much.<eos> I am very tired, Monsieur Poirot.<eos> I have not much to live for.<eos> But you have your home.<eos> Monsieur, I am grateful to George Stubbs for renting me the lodge but I do rent it.
That is it!<eos> How could I be so stupid? !<eos> Enjoying it, Ariadne?<eos> Please to forgive the intrusion, monsieur.<eos> Poirot. I really can't talk to you now.<eos> We're about to go on for the second half.<eos> Non!<eos> It will not be possible for you to play the remainder of this concert.<eos> Unless you give to me the address of Mademoiselle Zelie Rouxelle.<eos> - I don't know it.

Oui, Lieutenant Drouet.<eos> Sleep.<eos> You don't think Marrascaud will climb the mountain tonight?<eos> Non, mon ami.<eos> For he is already here.<eos> Shocking waste of paint.<eos> Whole hotel is simply festooned with this appalling tat.<eos> It appears, madame, that you are the connoisseuse, hein?<eos> Your little brooch, for instance, it is most fine.<eos> But I observe that you do not wear it today.

I'll teach you how to get yachts, I'll teach you how to get penthouses, and how to get something for yourself by taking it from someone who thinks it's his.<eos> Does it come with lemonade?<eos> It comes with all the lemonade you can drink.<eos> "Squeeze" had two meanings. Who's in?<eos> Sign 'em up.<eos> Sign 'em up.<eos> Come on, get your wallets out, let's go, guys.<eos> And George Sr. had even found a great way - to handle the heat. - Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> He had his twin brother endure it.
I don't know if there's a right time to say this, but this marriage of ours, it hasn't been working.<eos> Yeah, there's nothing keeping us together.<eos> I believe we're thinking the same thing.<eos> - Yeah, we should end it.<eos> - Let's give it another shot.<eos> To the head.<eos> Kill it.<eos> Yes.<eos> Lindsay was looking for inspiration before she set out on her new path.<eos> And it only took until the "Pray" section of Eat, Pray, Love for her to find it.
I'm confused.<eos> You all have children, yes?<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> And do those children make letters for you?<eos> Do they write letters?<eos> Do they make you drawings?<eos> And would you tear up those gifts in front of them?<eos> It's a dreadful thing to do.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Why must Father tear up the advertisement his children have made, and throw it in the fireplace?
Leanne?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Listen carefully.<eos> Your wife has been taken.<eos> At 4:30 p.m., you will go to the Vatashca Street parking garage.<eos> There, on Level 2 you will find a very special car.<eos> You will know which one.<eos> - Steal it.
I built it out of stuff I found in the garage.<eos> Yeah, Rick, it's great.<eos> - Is this the surprise?<eos> - Morty, I had to...<eos> I had to...<eos> I had to... I had to make a bomb, Morty.<eos> - I had to create a bomb.<eos> - What? ! A bomb?<eos> !<eos> We're gonna drop it down there just get a whole fresh start, Morty.
I surrender.<eos> Come on.<eos> Get off.<eos> Off him, off him.<eos> Get off him.<eos> I surrender.<eos> I surrender.<eos> Carroll's en route to Richmond.<eos> He'll be placed in federal detention until this is all over.<eos> 18 months I worked the case, couldn't crack it.
Sweetheart?<eos> Sweetheart?<eos> Mama, I can't.<eos> No, baby girl.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> I don't blame you.<eos> Looks like a super-heavy flow.<eos> Competitor 1124, you must make your way to the microphone now or be disqualified.<eos> Why don't you try to do a hop-scoot with your chair?<eos> Just grab both sides of it and you just kind of...
Any country you want.<eos> - Oh, one more thing.<eos> - Anything. I need you to find me the 1945 Martin D-28 acoustic guitar that used to belong to the childhood friend I buried a few weeks ago.<eos> I'm recording this tribute song for him, and I have to have that fucking guitar.<eos> It was so beautiful.<eos> Talk about a gorgeous sound.<eos> It was like listening to Jesus ejaculate into the mouth of the Angel Gabriel.<eos> Great.<eos> Excellent.<eos> You tell us where, and we will get it for you.
I got you a statue...<eos> the statue you wanted. - Nice.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Do I get a kiss?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Where did you get this?<eos> - You could put a plant in it.<eos> - What, you don't like it?<eos> - It's nice, it's nice. - Put it right there.<eos> - Put it over here?
- That's good.<eos> - There we go.<eos> How about that?<eos> - You like that?<eos> - Ma!<eos> - It's good, I like it.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> What do you want me to do with the turtle?<eos> Would you like me to tell you what to do with the turtle?<eos> - Put it down and don't break it.
- There we go.<eos> How about that?<eos> - You like that?<eos> - Ma!<eos> - It's good, I like it.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> What do you want me to do with the turtle?<eos> Would you like me to tell you what to do with the turtle?<eos> - Put it down and don't break it.<eos> - You don't like it?
Don't worry, all right, Chris? Don't worry.<eos> He knows I'd kill him.<eos> We're good.<eos> Right.<eos> Okay okay.<eos> Okay, this... is Empire.<eos> Okay, Thursday night I'll be the only one there.<eos> Eddie, off Boston Road there'll be a fence.<eos> At the top of the fence, there'll be a camera.<eos> I want you to break it.
Turner, Monet, Vermeer, those guys kept my eyes open.<eos> It was a feeling I had, a completeness when art touched me.<eos> I only started getting into trouble when I wanted to possess it.<eos> And you... what makes you do it?<eos> Money.<eos> Well, at least you're honest.<eos> It's always nice to know... who you can trust.<eos> I'm gonna find this painting.<eos> Not because I want to get you or your brother in trouble.<eos> I just want to hold it.
How long have you been cooking this thing up?<eos> Well, you remember Lola's little hot tub party?<eos> And great men don't miss their fate.<eos> I missed mine, Francie.<eos> I was probably staring at it the whole time and I just missed it.<eos> So everyone was in on this except for my lanky ass.<eos> People are predictable Francis, you, me.<eos> If we weren't, we'd just spend all our time trying to figure out what crazy shit everybody else was up to.<eos> All I did was drop off a sculpture.<eos> And then picked it on up.
The plan is... to not have a plan.<eos> I'll figure something out or else I'll trick someone like you into hiring me.<eos> Wait...<eos> The channel wants to launch a new show for the European market... Kind of like a...<eos> reality travel show!<eos> The host will live in some world famous cities for 3 months and we'll shoot his experiences.<eos> First year's line up starts with Paris, then Tokyo, Istanbul and we end in Berlin!<eos> And you want me to shoot this show?<eos> No...<eos> I want you to host it.
He's a bit strange.<eos> Not at all!<eos> Taran?<eos> Taran!<eos> Taran!<eos> Hi Aditi...<eos> You're looking beautiful!<eos> What are you doing? !<eos> My engagement ring fell into the pool!<eos> I'm saving it!
You still have two days left...<eos> just run away!<eos> Why did you change the channel?<eos> That was my TV show...<eos> Sorry.<eos> Didn't know that.<eos> Avi.<eos> Change it back.<eos> It's your show, man.<eos> How many times are you going to watch it?
Double jackpot?<eos> Las Vegas?<eos> The casino episode where she put 20 dollars in the slot machine and won 20,000.<eos> That host of yours is hot!<eos> You've seen my show, Avi?<eos> You have done what... 40 episodes?<eos> I've seen all.<eos> Then why were you pretending?<eos> It's your show, Bunny.<eos> How could I not see it?
The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night.<eos> How? !<eos> Sansa and Arya are captives in King's Landing.<eos> Returning him may buy life for my children.<eos> Ser Barristan Selmy, it is time to put aside your sword.<eos> You're too old to protect anyone.<eos> Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake.<eos> Here, boy.<eos> Melt it down and add it to the others.
Don't worry.<eos> They're still there.<eos> I know they're still there.<eos> You check every five minutes like you're afraid they're gonna move.<eos> I'm not afraid.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> You're almost there and you're afraid you won't make it.<eos> The closer you get, the worse the fear gets.<eos> No point in trying to hide behind that face.<eos> I know fear when I see it.
The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call.<eos> I still dream of that night.<eos> Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade.<eos> I dream of the voice from the flames.<eos> Was it a god?<eos> A demon?<eos> A conjuror's trick?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But the sorcerer called and a voice answered.<eos> And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it.
I need an army.<eos> We'll be in Astapor by nightfall.<eos> Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world.<eos> The greatest slave-soldiers in the world.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - Thoros of Myr.<eos> - Who do you fight for?<eos> - The Brotherhood without Banners.<eos> The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside.<eos> We're trying to save it.
I'll come visit you soon.<eos> What do you mean to do with him?<eos> You know what I mean to do with him.<eos> Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes?<eos> If it needs to be done, do it.<eos> Don't torture the boy.<eos> Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?<eos> No.<eos> If the lamb sees the knife, she panics.<eos> Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor.
It's the word that came to mind.<eos> ( chuckles )<eos> We're going to be sisters soon.<eos> We should be friends.<eos> You're a musical girl, aren't you?<eos> I imagine you have a lovely voice.<eos> A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid.<eos> Ah, but you know the song "The Rains of Castamere"?<eos> Of course.<eos> They play it so often here at court.
You didn't stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent.<eos> But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow.<eos> You're going to be loyal to your woman.<eos> The Night's Watch don't care if you live or die.<eos> Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die.<eos> We're just soldiers in their armies and there's plenty more to carry on if we go down.<eos> It's you and me that matters to me and you.<eos> Don't ever betray me.<eos> I won't.<eos> 'Cause I'll cut your pretty cock right off and wear it 'round my neck.
Do you hear me?<eos> I love you.<eos> Most men fuck like dogs.<eos> No grace, no skill.<eos> A few dozen thrusts and done.<eos> You need to be patient.<eos> Give her time.<eos> Your cock shouldn't go near her till she's slick as a baby seal.<eos> And then you go inside, but slowly.<eos> Don't jam it in like you're spearing a pig.
Have they told you what they plan to do with me?<eos> Lord Bolton's traveling tomorrow as well.<eos> He's going to the Twins for Edmure Tully's wedding.<eos> You're to remain here.<eos> With Locke?<eos> I owe you a debt.<eos> When Catelyn Stark released you, we both made a promise to her.<eos> Now it's your promise.<eos> You gave your word.<eos> Keep it and consider the debt paid.
You're far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle.<eos> Faint praise, my lord.<eos> So why did the Citadel take your chain?<eos> Did you fondle one boy too many?<eos> No, my lord.<eos> That's not my weakness.<eos> What is?<eos> Curiosity.<eos> The only way to treat disease is to understand disease.<eos> And the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted.
- Bad.<eos> - Bad.<eos> Gary, every time...<eos> You see those wontons, Gary?<eos> - You see the size of them?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Those wontons are too big, my friend.<eos> Everybody loves those.<eos> People ask us for the recipe.<eos> We won't provide it.
- Mm-hmm.<eos> Those wontons are too big, my friend.<eos> Everybody loves those.<eos> People ask us for the recipe.<eos> We won't provide it.<eos> It's part of our training... how to deal with people who want the recipe too bad.<eos> - Oh?<eos> -We have a phrase we have to repeat.<eos> - What is that?<eos> - "We won't provide it."
- on!<eos> on!<eos> - My God.<eos> Maybe that's good.<eos> Maybe that's good.<eos> Maybe he got it out.<eos> Maybe he got it out of his system.<eos> Dad, can you bring the car up?<eos> Yeah, I'll just...<eos> I'll carry it, I guess, or fly it over the forest.
Hey Dynamo!<eos> It's all your fault!<eos> You scattered around the rink not leaving anybody at the cage. You, Spartak, it's you to blame!<eos> Stop that! That's not appropriate!<eos> Stop yelling!<eos> Shut you up!<eos> Hey Spartak, did you score at least one goal tonight?<eos> Everybody to the rink!<eos> Anatoli Vladimirovich, Mikhailov got a dislocated shoulder.<eos> So locate it back where it belongs!
You got to leave my family out of this.<eos> Okay?<eos> If you don't drop your gun, I will hurt her and I will hurt you.<eos> We didn't do anything to you.<eos> We don't deserve this.<eos> I don't deserve this either.<eos> Now, listen, I don't want to hurt any of you, but I am not dying tonight!<eos> Drop yvufgun-<eos> Please.<eos> Drop it.
She was here.<eos> It was her. I know.<eos> - You all right?<eos> - Yeah. We got to call the police and tell them everything.<eos> - With what?<eos> We don't have any evidence.<eos> - Well, we have a videotape.<eos> Yeah, with no time stamp, no date.<eos> The image is so poor, you barely recognize your own daughter.<eos> They'll rip it to shreds.
Yeah, in New York City.<eos> But that's not why I'm calling.<eos> I found something else.<eos> It's... it's a death certificate.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Your son.<eos> Injuries sustained in a car crash.<eos> And that's not the weird part.<eos> The date is blank.<eos> All they have to do is fill it in.
- And you making quite mess of it.<eos> - Am I?<eos> Oh yeah.<eos> It appears that one of your clientele has misplaced my vehicle.<eos> Come on, my friend...<eos> Let's have a drink and take it easy.<eos> You are not my friend, I don't drink, and I haven't taken it easy since 1991.<eos> Now, where is my fucking car?<eos> Ohh!<eos> I wish I could help you to find it,
Get Junior in here so we can draw some blood.<eos> Please take off your jacket.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Roll up your sleeve.<eos> - Is the needle disposable?<eos> - We use nothing else.<eos> Can you unpack another one, so I can see for myself<eos> I can't do that.<eos> It comes with the inventory kit.<eos> Unpack another kit and I'll pay for it.
Then we started to use protection again.<eos> And when he came out, his condom wasn't on.<eos> Where was it?<eos> Half was inside me but emptying on the bed sheet.<eos> No danger, then.<eos> And yet, I saw his face go white.<eos> He got up, turned on the light, checked how much was still inside.<eos> He kept peering at me.<eos> I said, why don't you get the flashlight and check?<eos> If we had a flashlight, he'd have used it.
"H."<eos> Is that still a good color?<eos> That's a very good color.<eos> The truth is that anything you can say about the diamond is in the nature of a flaw.<eos> A perfect diamond would be composed simply of light.<eos> Do you see the inclusion?<eos> No.<eos> It is small, what we would call a feather.<eos> Yes.<eos> I think I see it.
If we could use your house in the country for a couple of days?<eos> No-one will look for him there.<eos> Pardoe, stop the car.<eos> I'm amazed you should ask, when the police are out there looking for him right this moment!<eos> I don't know why you're amazed, we encouraged the band.<eos> I don't see how that changes anything.<eos> I'm stunned you should ask ME, Stanley, truly stunned.<eos> But I am asking you, because I know, in a way, you will understand, and want to do something.<eos> Just for two days?<eos> We use your house, you could say you knew nothing about it, after all I've been to the house, I could have suggested it to Louis - there's the stable block.
I am the boss.<eos> I hired you. Now we have a lot of work to do.<eos> We could sit here arguing about language and music And blah-De-De-Blah, but we got a lot of work to do, We got a lot of lines to paint,<eos> I suggest you start the machine and keep it going.<eos> Yeah. Alvin.<eos> You have your tool belt on backwards.<eos> Let's just enjoy the silence.<eos> Dear Madison, Thank you for your poetic letter.<eos> There is so little to do out here.<eos> I must have read it a hundred times.
You show a commitment to the process, leadership capabilities.<eos> When you've shown us that you can handle responsibilities beyond your petty little selves. Congratulations on that day.<eos> You are now a useful citizen.<eos> You can then write your ticket out of this place.<eos> Or you can stay, come work for me, pass on what you've learned.<eos> We take care of our own.<eos> Let me see that watch son.<eos> This watch is a lot older than you are.<eos> I'll hang on to this.<eos> You'll get it back when you're ready.
Listen to me!<eos> All right?<eos> You need to let me go.<eos> This isn't me and this isn't fair.<eos> You need to let me go.<eos> I'm not going to tell anybody.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Who's got the pickax now motherfucker?<eos> Who wants it?
I had an uncle who lived here with his cats.<eos> Us 10 nephews weren't interested in him.<eos> I always sent him a Christmas card.<eos> One day I got a call from the notary.<eos> He'd left me his house.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> What's that look for?<eos> What did you expect, a house with white floorboards?<eos> Not at all, I like it. It... It has charm.<eos> At first I wanted to sell it.
I've got another house at Les Portes, a real gem.<eos> Can we visit it now?<eos> I have to call the owner.<eos> Just out of curiosity, what was the play you're offering me?<eos> "The Misanthrope".<eos> You're staging "The Misanthrope"?<eos> I have the theater, a producer, and I start casting in 2 weeks.<eos> "The Misanthrope". No less.<eos> For your first play?<eos> I've always dreamed of performing it.
I think I'm gonna feel about it the same way Kasparov felt when they could... - No longer compete with that computer.<eos> - Big Blue. Right.<eos> Nobody thought a computer could beat our best.<eos> "A machine lacks that ineffable human instinct."<eos> You know, and now we can't even compete.<eos> I saw a documentary where they were doing an experiment on a lab rat.<eos> And he was wired up... And he could push a switch and have an orgasm.<eos> And so the scientists were sort of laughing at this pathetic little creature... While it ignored his food and water and didn't do anything else. And eventually it just died.<eos> I mean, I think that's the future of humanity. You know, just,<eos> Well, well, maybe so... But every generation believes that they're witnessing the end of the world... But I feel that I'm actually living it.
Mr. RadissonHilton.<eos> And I know that time when you were doing that reading in Washington... When your cell phone supposedly broke that night.<eos> How convenient.<eos> Swear on our kids you didn't fuck that lady from the bookstore. Emily.<eos> Swear to me you didn't fuck that Emily girl.<eos> And I'm not jealous because I'm not the type. But I just wanna know. Okay?<eos> Be a man and admit the truth.<eos> I am giving you my whole life, okay?<eos> I got nothing larger to give.<eos> I'm not giving it to anybody else.
Didn't he tell you?<eos> His men-- they didn't make it.<eos> Oh, no, Jude.<eos> You heard the man.<eos> No spas, no pedicures. What will poor Bambi and Thumper do?<eos> - Hey, screw you.<eos> - Okay, everyone calm down.<eos> What matters is that we're safe here.<eos> Safe?<eos> It's ground zero of the pandemic that could end human life as we know it.
You can really see the influence of your Jesuit education... as well as a few flurries of style favoured by law clerks...<eos> That's a bit harsh!<eos> It's not that there aren't any good bits here and there... it's this one bit, which is very moving, where you ask me to be your wife.<eos> I love you, you love me, isn't that natural?<eos> It is, Nicolas.<eos> Of course it's natural.<eos> Do you remember what the late Queen always used to say?<eos> Marriage is all about having sex, being fat and giving birth!<eos> I owe you my, so-far, short life.<eos> Do you really want to claim it already?
So nice to see you, again.<eos> They say it's pretty crazy out there.<eos> Where's your tie?<eos> Uh, I couldn't remember.<eos> Remember?<eos> How to tie it.<eos> It's, uh, a Windsor knot.<eos> I think. Hey, man, I could tie it for you.<eos> I mean, I don't know if it's a Windsor, but it's the kind I do on me, for church.<eos> Tie it on me.
- Grape.<eos> So! The First Citizen of Florence is desperate for us to fashion him a colombina.<eos> 'Desperate' is a strong word.<eos> And yet it happens to be the word I used.<eos> But let's review.<eos> Every Easter, a grand procession makes its way through the streets of Florence, terminating at the cathedral.<eos> Why do you insist on stating what every child of three already knows?<eos> Why do you insist on interrupting me?<eos> I have a methodology.<eos> We can follow it.
We are known as the Sons of Mithras.<eos> Much of what you call 'progress' has simply been a matter of remembering what was once forgotten.<eos> This knowledge was set down in a compendium known as the Book of Leaves.<eos> Recently, certain clues have surfaced regarding the Book's location.<eos> Avraham ben Yosef was following those clues when he was apprehended and put to death.<eos> Perhaps you have heard of the Secret Archives the Vatican has assembled?<eos> Its curator is a man called Lupo Mercuri.<eos> A fallen son of Mithras.<eos> Where we seek to disseminate and preserve knowledge.<eos> They seek to alter and suppress it.
Just a few simple words, and we can end all this unpleasantness.<eos> He was searching...<eos> The Jew swallowed something.<eos> What, child?<eos> A key.<eos> Leave nothing unturned.<eos> Just find the key.<eos> (MAN) Rip it apart!<eos> Stop!<eos> You won't find it.
(Chuckles) Not at all.<eos> We embrace it.<eos> Really?<eos> ! Really?<eos> Are we at an impasse, then?<eos> That would be unfortunate.<eos> This is your last chance for an amicable partnership.<eos> I decline your offer.<eos> (Shouting) I pledge allegiance to Lorenzo the Magnificent, his foolish brother, and the whole of Florence!<eos> You want to tame Florence, but I prefer it wild, for all its quirks and criminals.
This is so amazing, and it's not just about revenge, OK?<eos> Like, we're really going to do something good here - by exposing Abaddon. - No.<eos> I don't care. I don't give a shit about any of that.<eos> I just want to fuck these guys. I want to fuck this whole company.<eos> I mean, what have I got to lose?<eos> They're just going to fire my ass anyway, right?<eos> You know, I've always been more of a rebel at heart.<eos> I never really learned how to work the system.<eos> Well, that makes two of us.<eos> Hey, I have such exciting news, I had to share it.
I miss being a part of everything.<eos> We're not losing each other.<eos> We're just changing.<eos> For now.<eos> I ruined your birthday.<eos> Liza Minnelli sang a song you wrote for me.<eos> I'd say that pretty much makes it the best birthday ever.<eos> Happy Birthday.<eos> So basically, we realized the show could really deepen if the diva felt Amanda was responsible for her downfall.<eos> The whole second act, she can plot her revenge and then enact it in the end.
Move.<eos> What?<eos> This scene shouldn't be here.<eos> We had it at the top.<eos> We cut this song, this one too.<eos> What?<eos> We had a better version of this entire sequence.<eos> We worked on it all night, wasted, remember?<eos> Fourth of July.<eos> I thought it was on my computer, but I can't find it anywhere.
I'm sorry, okay?<eos> Do you even know what you're apologizing for?<eos> I'll do better.<eos> I will.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> She's not doing your song.<eos> See you at Joe's pub in three years.<eos> I want to end with a new song tonight.<eos> It's never been sung in front of an audience before, but I had to share it with you because it touched my heart.
Come on, to the shops with you.<eos> And you just have to get used to boys taking your daughter on adventures.<eos> I had to.<eos> So, wanna see what's on TV?<eos> - That was meant to be a joke.<eos> - I don't have time for jokes.<eos> Sorry!<eos> Didn't realise this was such a busy time for you.<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> This whole island is depending on me to keep it pristine and untouched and you're touching it.
Wait, what?<eos> She uses a pen name, which you would know if you were a real fan.<eos> She's actually in Bora-Bora right now, researching her next book.<eos> I've always imagined some grizzled, bearded man banging on a typewriter in a hut somewhere.<eos> But that's brilliant.<eos> Explains the sensitive side.<eos> Have you read the latest one, Alex Rover Never Surrenders?<eos> I'm almost at the end.<eos> It's torturing me that I don't have time to finish it right now.<eos> I think it's genius when Alex gets the queen bee, and drops it in the enemy camp and the swarm comes.
Sorry.<eos> Seems like I'm always messing up your big plans.<eos> No, this wouldn't be half as much fun without you.<eos> This is fun?<eos> Are you sure there aren't any endangered species who live in nice, safe, low to ground places?<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's, uh... Let's lure this iguana out for its close-up.<eos> I mean, a week ago baiting iguanas with candy would have seemed crazy to me.<eos> What was so different a week ago?<eos> Well, I was planning my adventure on your island, not living it.
I would have said, it's ridiculous, it's going to fail.<eos> It's going to hurt the long term legacy.<eos> People will forget the strip quickly.<eos> Because part of Snoopy's enduring legacy is that your four year old can have a plush Snoopy and then learn about the cartoons and the strip.<eos> They fall in love with merchandising first and then the characters and the content and the art.<eos> So I'd say the strip is going to go, vanish, we'll never hear from it again and there will be people like me, 40 years from now, talking about it the same way we do about Krazy Kat and Pogo.<eos> Brilliant, wonderful; the public has forgotten.<eos> Not with Calvin and Hobbes.<eos> It's universal.<eos> It has maintained it's quality and integrity to the point that kids today, coming up, are still reading it.

Oh, God.<eos> The day from hell.<eos> You'll get back.<eos> You just have to give it time, let things play out.<eos> They'll close ranks.<eos> That's how it works.<eos> Those that haven't already.<eos> I'm screwed, Freya.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm just trying to look the damn beast in the eye, see it for what it is.
- Daddy, you're back!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Thanks to you.<eos> My boys.<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> Renai, it's me, it's okay.<eos> I tried reaching you. I tried everything.<eos> I played your song.<eos> I should've known it was you.<eos> Only you could play it that badly.
Oh, yeah. Sorry.<eos> Say no more.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - No, it's fine.<eos> What, are you fucking kidding me? !<eos> You're fucking kidding me, right? ! - Baby!<eos> - What?<eos> I feel like I should leave my jacket in the car.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> Should I bring it?
Why would she want to come back to this?<eos> It's ok.<eos> It's gonna be ok, ok?<eos> It has to be ok.<eos> I'm telling you, this is it.<eos> Go in.<eos> You go in.<eos> It's your door.<eos> Well, what if it has an Indiana Jones hair-trigger thing and it closes behind me the second I walk through?<eos> If there's a chance for us to leave this place, you two are gonna take it.
No, but, uh, why don't you tell me?<eos> Zero.<eos> Zero point zero fucking zero.<eos> - That doesn't sound good.<eos> - It isn't fucking good.<eos> - It's bloody terrible.<eos> - It's also not true.<eos> You played a song for me at your party the other night.<eos> I wrote that when I was 12 years old.<eos> I was trying to recycle it.
Enough about Karen.<eos> Isn't it weird, though, because she works for you?<eos> I'm paying Karen to remodel my home.<eos> If she thinks she can expect more than a paycheck for her services, fuck her.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - All's fair, Hank.<eos> I see you and your husband have the same twisted sense of entitlement.<eos> That's--it's actually kind of cute.<eos> I don't want to twist your arm, but, um,<eos> I'd like to take your hand here and shove it up my skirt.
Hello, sweetheart.<eos> Did you have a nice sleep?<eos> Did I take an Ambien?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> Did you drug me again, you fucking wanker?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Guess what, though.<eos> While you were sleeping, I wrote you a fucking song.<eos> I'll play it to you back at the hotel.
And that's not a good feeling.<eos> Anyway, I should go.<eos> Thank you!<eos> - But before I do...<eos> - Oh, jeez!<eos> Just bear with me.<eos> I want to throw down a challenge for you to go out to dinner before I leave town.<eos> I'll tell you if a window opens up.<eos> Great.<eos> And if it does, don't minimize it.
Let him flow.<eos> You can't bring me down, I'm too positive.<eos> Let me share something with you. Nah.<eos> Come.<eos> I'll explain in a way that's visual.<eos> He's bigger than you.<eos> Be careful.<eos> So you're out there, you take a photo.<eos> Pretend. Go ahead.<eos> So you take that photo, put it on the line...

Go ahead.<eos> So you take that photo, put it on the line...<eos> Online.<eos> Put it on Twitter, whatever you want.
They're not always without cost and I should mind that better.<eos> But trust me - trust me... ..no-one defines me.<eos> Not Florence's outdated laws and certainly... certainly...not you.<eos> Your infatuation will fade and you will find others to love.<eos> I have no doubt.<eos> Every kiss sends a message.<eos> That one...was goodbye.<eos> Goodbye?<eos> Do you know, I've never heard that tune from anyone except you.<eos> My father used to hum it to me when I was a child.
The other key that opens the Vault of Heaven?<eos> Yes, tell me.<eos> It's waiting in Rome, there for your taking.<eos> And, when you have both keys... ..your mother, Caterina she is alive.<eos> She carries the Book of Leaves for us, beneath the post of the sun in a town made of stone... ..in a land on my map.<eos> Why... I need you to decode the map. Then you may take what you need.<eos> Here.<eos> Here is the secret to deciphering the map.<eos> I will not survive to come with you.<eos> You must cut my flesh loose and take it with you... ..once I die.
Then... then perhaps I'll entertain myself while I wait.<eos> The Vatican choir could use a new castrato.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Move away.<eos> God! Fuck!<eos> Aargh.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> Young Nico.<eos> I... I see our first encounter left your hand shaking.<eos> I'll steady it in your heart.
Case in point.<eos> You were warned.<eos> You were warned in this very room.<eos> I accept many commissions, I finish few.<eos> I gave you the chance to be the foremost artist of your day.<eos> I gave you the most desirable woman in Florence as a subject.<eos> She was never my subject.<eos> You and I love this city, do we not?<eos> We do.<eos> Then help me save it.
No.<eos> We must stand and fight.<eos> We must make monsters.<eos> We know your countrymen tried to make the perfect soldier themselves once.<eos> To splice human and ape genes.<eos> And create a stronger individual.<eos> Unfortunately for you...<eos> Stalin is as scared of science as he is of religion.<eos> He didn't appreciate that... one must confront ones fears... in order to conquer them.<eos> To harness nature we must first break it... to pieces and rebuild them in our own design.
I see things, I feel things, ever since I was little.<eos> - Do you make money with it?<eos> - Yes. I can't complain.<eos> I work in my town, and abroad.<eos> I'm going to Mexico to work.<eos> - What are you going to do there?<eos> - I specialize in the dead.<eos> - The dead!<eos> I smell death.<eos> I feel it.
When we get to Mexico, you're in for it!<eos> Maybe we'll never land in Mexico.<eos> Right now, we're flying in circles around Toledo.<eos> Toledo, Ohio?<eos> No, Toledo, Castile-La Mancha.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Part of the landing gear isn't working, so... we have to do an emergency landing and that's very dangerous.<eos> The runway has to be prepared in a special way...<eos> A whole fuss. Why don't they prepare it now?
It stinks of death.<eos> That's enough!<eos> We're all scared shitless, but we're trying to hide it.<eos> So make an effort, please.<eos> Or at least be quiet!<eos> Let her talk, it'll just take a minute.<eos> Go on, Bruna.<eos> I've been smelling death for hours.<eos> It began at the start of the trip, but... I thought it was the farts.<eos> I don't smell it everywhere.
How do you know about Becca's thing tonight?<eos> Oh, we keep in touch.<eos> She's always asking me questions about writing.<eos> She never asks me questions about writing.<eos> Okay, hi.<eos> I'm--I'm--I'm here to see Natalie.<eos> Natalie's my wife.<eos> Natalie said, "Let the new designer in."<eos> Okay, that's--that's me.<eos> I don't want to twist your arm, but, um, I'd like to take your hand here... And shove it up my skirt.
Don't we have an event at 11:00?<eos> There won't be any events until we talk.<eos> You're hijacking the microphone.<eos> You're contradicting everything I say.<eos> We need to be promoting the watershed act.<eos> Well, I appreciate your being so forthright.<eos> Let me tell you what I don't appreciate.<eos> The D.N.C. Is running a man with zero track record, except for substance abuse, to fill my shoes.<eos> I realize you don't want to be here, sir, but it seems like you're deliberately trying to sabotage my campaign.<eos> Despite my better judgment, I'm trying to save it.
Your husband was very explicit.<eos> I would categorize it as a threat.<eos> - What did he say exactly?<eos> - Not to surprise him.<eos> Didn't he also tell you to vote your district and your conscience?<eos> He did, but those seemed far lower on his priority list.<eos> Well, he would never fault you if you had a compelling reason to do what you think is right.<eos> I'm confused.<eos> Aren't you for this bill?<eos> C.W.I. Is publicly for it.
Oh, don't tell me you haven't said those words before.<eos> I know you have.<eos> We all have, if you've ever felt so crushing a loss.<eos> There are two parents with us today who know that pain,<eos> the most terrible hurt of all--<eos> Losing a child before her time.<eos> If Dean and leanne were to stand up right now and scream those awful words of hate, could we blame them?<eos> I couldn't.<eos> At least their hatred I can understand.<eos> I can grasp it, but God's wantonness, his cruelty, I can't even begin to--
I'll fall on this grenade myself, just to piss them off.<eos> Give me John king at CNN.<eos> Wait, Frank.<eos> This is not your fault.<eos> No, we have to protect your reputation.<eos> But you're the man that needs to get the bill through the house.<eos> I will-- hang on. I will assign it to one of my deputies, quietly manage it, and help guide you through the process.<eos> I am not comfortable with this.<eos> Well, then what do you suggest we do?<eos> What a martyr craves more than anything is a sword to fall on, so you sharpen the blade, hold it at just the right angle, and then 3, 2, 1--
If you can save my brother, then you can have my soul.<eos> You know, not many people would sacrifice so much for someone else.<eos> You must love him a lot.<eos> You don't even know what she's going to do with it.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I'll deal with my soul later.<eos> If Robbie dies now, all he'll ever be is lost.<eos> I always thought he was selfish, but if I let this curse kill him because I'm afraid of the unknown, I'm worse.<eos> I hurt a lot of people running from that fear, and I never wanna do it again.<eos> I'd rather live the life I have, really live, than waste it hiding, afraid of killing the people that I love.
That's all you've been fighting for.<eos> You don't think that I see the irony in that?<eos> I wanted my freedom to live as a better man,<eos> I get the apocalypse.<eos> And now, I am... alone.<eos> Alone?<eos> You're alone?<eos> What about me and Josh?<eos> We used to be enough.<eos> I'm sorry you didn't get your freedom exactly the way you wanted it.
Well, you know, a job like this, you tend to see people at their worst.<eos> Yeah, you gotta be willing to give people the benefit of the doubt.<eos> Otherwise, it'll crush you.<eos> So, you're not gonna have me led away in shackles?<eos> Uh, are you putting me in danger being here?<eos> No.<eos> And the identity, that's for...<eos> Money, I guess.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Uh, the ability to rent a car and book it to Canada.
You wanna jump me right now.<eos> If this wasn't your best shirt...<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> I'd tear it off your body.<eos> Uh-huh!<eos> You should maybe try that.<eos> - Let's lock Martha out.<eos> - Yeah, Martha.<eos> And you are going to die when you see the master bath.<eos> I almost spilled future generations just looking at it!
All of my wedding fantasies date back to the 9th grade.<eos> I'm feeling nostalgic.<eos> Can I open the door?<eos> Ok.<eos> I really wanna come out there, but I also really wanna eat you.<eos> I understand.<eos> Hey!<eos> For short notice,<eos> I think I found a pretty great wedding dress.<eos> Do you wanna see it?
- I don't have a problem with the money.<eos> - It's just--<eos> - Yeah, I know. I know.<eos> It's the morality.<eos> I understand.<eos> Because it's a commercial venture.<eos> But- - But don't think of it that way.<eos> Think of it that you're boosting the ego.<eos> You're helping their self-esteem.<eos> Yeah, maybe that dilutes it.
Ask yourself why he couldn't cut you up.<eos> He has just one tiny scrap of decency left in him.<eos> You just helped him find that, OK?<eos> Now you.<eos> Don't ever forget this.<eos> OK, move, move, move.<eos> The Eye of Harmony.<eos> Exploding star.<eos> In the act of becoming a black hole.<eos> Time Lord engineering - you rip the star from its orbit, suspend it in a permanent state of decay.
The Avatar has gone missing.<eos> After president Raiko refused Korra's request to aid the South in the war of the water tribes, she headed to the fire nation, seeking a new ally against Unalaq.<eos> But unbeknownst to her friends, a dark spirit attacked Korra and dragged her into the ocean.<eos> She has washed up on a desolate island with no memory of who she is.<eos> We found the Avatar washed up onshore, but she doesn't remember anything.<eos> Raava.<eos> Raava.<eos> Raava.<eos> A dark energy has infected her.<eos> We must purge it before it destroys her Avatar spirit.
You and Raava are just in time to help us clear these tree-killing fire-lovers out of here just like the old days.<eos> You are the one who's getting cleared out.<eos> There's no need for violence.<eos> I know there must be a way to work out a compromise.<eos> You have a good heart, stinky.<eos> These fire tossers aren't like you.<eos> Spirits like him killed our friends.<eos> I can't let them get away with that.<eos> We are protectors of the forest.<eos> We won't let you burn it down.
Look at what you're doing to everyone.<eos> I did that?<eos> In the spirit world, your emotions become your reality, especially for the Avatar because you are the bridge between the two worlds.<eos> You must try to stay positive.<eos> [Sniffles]<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> There.<eos> You see?<eos> I can make the sun shine?<eos> Even in the material world, you will find that if you look for the light, you can often find it.
It's good to see you again. You and Raava are just in time to help us clear these tree-killing fire-lovers out of here just like the old days.<eos> You are the one who's getting cleared out.<eos> There's no need for violence.<eos> I know there must be a way to work out a compromise.<eos> You have a good heart, stinky.<eos> These fire tossers aren't like you.<eos> Spirits like him killed our friends.<eos> I can't let them get away with that.<eos> We are protectors of the forest.<eos> We won't let you burn it down.
Killed by your own blood.<eos> Am I dead?<eos> 'm Dead.<eos> This is hell!<eos> - I should not be here!<eos> - What?<eos> What you should not be here?<eos> That they all say.<eos> But you still have body.<eos> Till I burn it.
Absolutely not.<eos> I think we should wait until you get out of college and we have a couple of years to travel around together.<eos> And how are we going to afford to take a couple of years to travel around together?<eos> I'm going to be getting into family law and you're going to be a teacher.<eos> I think we're doing road trips.<eos> You know the job interview today?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got the job.<eos> Well, it's not exactly a job.<eos> They bought my idea and they're going to let me make it, and, well,
Yeah.<eos> And we're renegotiating.<eos> - Wicks... - Listen.<eos> You got a great situation here.<eos> I'm not looking to fuck it up but you better believe I want a piece.<eos> Been on the road for two years.<eos> And nothing... I mean nothing has panned out.<eos> You give me some fucking hush money, send me on my way. We both know I'm gonna end up back inside. And you know what?<eos> I'm not going back.<eos> This is my only play, and I'm making it.
if you kill it, it would be just like giving yourself a lobotomy.<eos> You would become a zombie.<eos> Not a good idea.<eos> This creature is a physical manifestation of your dark side.<eos> - What?<eos> - You gotta accept this.<eos> Accept it.<eos> Take it to yourself.<eos> Bond with it.<eos> That's your only way to control it.
Ride!<eos> Lord!<eos> Follow me!<eos> God has delivered us from slavery!<eos> We're giong to live in the promised land.<eos> Abraham's dream is our future.<eos> You are our future now, Joshua.<eos> You must take the land promised to Abraham.<eos> Moses has led the Israelites to the edge of the promised land.<eos> Under Joshua, they must conquer it.
Forgive me.<eos> No one here can read your mind...<eos> Then what use are any of you?<eos> ...but my God can.<eos> He has shown me your dream.<eos> Then you will be able to tell it to me...<eos> Every detail.<eos> You saw a giant statue of a man.<eos> Its head made of gold.<eos> Then a giant stone struck the statue, smashing it to pieces...
Ok. So bring it ahead.<eos> Move the barricade!<eos> Go help him!<eos> What are you doing there? Come on!<eos> - Come on, hurry! - Open it up.<eos> - Are you crazy? - Hurry!<eos> The Minister's convoy will be coming any minute!<eos> is he pregnant as well?<eos> Where is your car?<eos> I can't see it, sir.
You begging for money?<eos> Throw him out!<eos> It's not about the money.<eos> There's something bigger than money.<eos> Respect!<eos> I had given you'll a chance.<eos> Give me ten acres of land from Jhumli and make your bridge.<eos> Lateshbhai it's about the principle.<eos> Being the regional collector, it's your duty to make the bridge... lfyou refuse to make the bridge I will be forced to approach MP Kirtibhai.<eos> Dad, can I drive it?
What? An afternoon with Mr Bligh?<eos> Aren't you the lucky one?<eos> Not quite.<eos> Mrs Bligh.<eos> Well.<eos> That is an honour.<eos> Thanks to the Evelyn Hutchins Dance Academy!<eos> Could be a special on sprained ankles after that, girls.<eos> And now a recitation.<eos> Let's hear it for Roy Briggs, our master of the bush ballad.
About what Louis said.<eos> I agree.<eos> Are you following any of this?<eos> No.<eos> We're talking about a vice intrinsic to water.<eos> Start reading from "This vice... "<eos> Page 62<eos> Throwing away the skin?<eos> Yeah, why?<eos> You don't eat it?
It's why we hired you. Ok.<eos> You're making it impossible for me to market this car.<eos> Nobody's gonna buy a car named Howard.<eos> It's like naming a restaurant hepatitis.<eos> - It's a name.<eos> - It's not a good name.<eos> Call it a Dewey.<eos> That's a good name.<eos> - A Duncan.<eos> Call it Duncan.
Get the fuck out of here!<eos> Hey, stumpo, it's me, Frank.<eos> I don't give a shit, get out of here.<eos> Hey, Joe, can I talk to you for a minute?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I know that your family owned Blue heron for a long time.<eos> Three generations.<eos> And I've seen what this multi-billionaire has done to your old property and to the island.<eos> He's destroying the island.<eos> I wanna blow it up.
I know that your family owned Blue heron for a long time.<eos> Three generations.<eos> And I've seen what this multi-billionaire has done to your old property and to the island.<eos> He's destroying the island.<eos> I wanna blow it up.<eos> Why do you wanna blow it up?<eos> I want him off the island.<eos> - Is he fucking with me?<eos> - He is not fucking with you.<eos> You think you wanna blow it up?
See, you're just overly sensitive about people taking your things because of the...<eos> Testicular cancer.<eos> You let them take my ball.<eos> You were supposed to guard me, like a sentry.<eos> Oh, I think it looks so much better with just the one.<eos> It's more distinctive.<eos> Don't patronize me.<eos> Let me miss my ball.<eos> Now... now he's in the pool.<eos> I just cleaned it.
Don't you dare.<eos> Yeah, stay back.<eos> I'm armed. With a screwdriver.<eos> Sonic.<eos> You know all the stories.<eos> You must know if there's another way out.<eos> There's the tale. A secret song.<eos> The Thief of the Temple and the Nimmer's Door.<eos> And the secret songs open the secret door? How does it go?<eos> Can you sing it?
Somebody say something?<eos> Did Will say something?<eos> - No, he's still on the air.<eos> - I'm gonna get asked back?<eos> It's not up to me.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm gonna give you a story now.<eos> I'm gonna give you a name to call, but you have to use me to help you follow it.<eos> What kind of story?<eos> You have to use me to help you follow it.
What's with the hand signals?<eos> It's a Quaker tradition and a peaceful way of maintaining order when your movement has no leaders.<eos> Doesn't a movement need leaders?<eos> We believe in a horizontal structure.<eos> Are you worried that the horizontal structure is gonna give power to people who shouldn't have it?<eos> You mean Joel and John?<eos> Shelly, you started off with one clear and not unreasonable demand and now you've got, like, 14 of them, including arresting Bear Stearns and the Lehman Brothers.<eos> You doing a story or giving advice?<eos> I haven't been assigned the story, so I'm giving advice.<eos> And you can't have a protest unless the media's covering it.

He's already squirreled away in an air vent somewhere with his fucking statistics.<eos> Where?<eos> Where's his office?<eos> You know that portrait with the guy who looks like a fat Wolverine?<eos> - Oh, yeah. - It's just one door on the left from there.<eos> - But wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> - What?<eos> You know what's gonna happen to me tomorrow?<eos> No.<eos> My good friend POTUS, my Gamma Chi brother, is gonna summon me to his office and he's gonna show me a sword and he's gonna tell me to take the sword and slide it down my throat until it comes out my ass.
This is such a silly conversation that we're having.<eos> I'm gonna go talk to the President.<eos> - He went to bed.<eos> - He's in bed?<eos> So that makes you the live wire, huh?<eos> - This can't get out.<eos> - It won't get out.<eos> JONAH: Everyone, POTUS has gone to bed.<eos> So let's make sure we make his dreams come true tonight by fighting until that last bullet.<eos> Why don't you take the first bullet and put it through your brain?
We just lost the House and you're crowing?<eos> You're actually pleased about this?<eos> Why?<eos> Because well, we lost the House, that's bad, obviously, but now this gets me off your case and that's okay?<eos> Couldn't have put that better myself, sir.<eos> Are you eating my pizza?<eos> No, sir, you...<eos> Because you said that...<eos> No, I said don't wave it in my face.<eos> - I didn't say eat it.

- that you had no control- - he filmed the entire thing, and then he threatened to put it up on different sites if I said anything to anybody.<eos> Obviously you weren't in control of Christian. I am.<eos> I'm telling you this because I think he's gonna hurt you in the same way.<eos> No, you're telling me this because you're jealous and a little drunk.<eos> God, it's such a girl-thing to do.<eos> Look, Christian's not gonna hurt me.<eos> If anything, I'm the one that's gonna hurt him.<eos> She's on her way back.<eos> We got 20 minutes.<eos> We are now hacking into Ryan's Facebook page because you have to be friends with him to look at it. Bla bla bla.
E- mail me your figure. I'll call you back with a counter.<eos> This is our top priority-- Ohio,<eos> Florida, and Pennsylvania.<eos> We need all of them, or Walker's a one-term president.<eos> Pennsylvania is why he picked Matthews as a running mate.<eos> But now we have to find a replacement.<eos> The special election is this November.<eos> Patricia Whittaker, D.N.C. chair.<eos> A rare example of someone whose head is in the game instead of up their backside.<eos> Competence is such an exotic bird in these woods that I appreciate it whenever I see it.
Now, I won't argue the business side of things.<eos> It's neither my place nor my area of expertise, but know this--<eos> Zoe Barnes, Twitter, blogs, enriched media, they're all surface.<eos> They're fads.<eos> They aren't the foundation this paper was built on, and they aren't what will keep it alive.<eos> We have a core readership that thirsts for hard news.<eos> Those are the people I work 80 hours a week for.<eos> And I won't be distracted by what's fashionable.<eos> That's your resignation letter.<eos> Hand it to the lawyers on the way out.
War orphan.<eos> Found her abandoned in what used to be Denver.<eos> She was in a bad situation.<eos> I rescued her and raised her.<eos> She's a good girl.<eos> That's why she nearly cut my doctor's throat?<eos> Like I said, she's a good girl.<eos> Now, your lawkeeper, he took away my weapon.<eos> Just doing his job.<eos> Yeah, nevertheless, I'd really like it back now.
Where are you taking her?<eos> Oh, it's actually not my date.<eos> I have to go to a date that Juliet is having with another dude.<eos> It's a long story, guys.<eos> It's complicated.<eos> But don't worry, there's no touching above the knees and absolutely none of this.<eos> What? Is that opening a can?<eos> [Laughs] Mom.<eos> Everybody knows what that is.<eos> I want it back by midnight.
You had no choice but to get rid of 'em the old-fashioned way. Cccchhhh!<eos> [Gasping] [Slo-mo] Goose!<eos> - Who is goose?<eos> - I don't know!<eos> I mean, I would never use those pictures to get dates.<eos> How could you do this to us?<eos> Yes, Ken.<eos> How could you?<eos> Look at that pug's face.<eos> Look at it!
Good work!<eos> Jules, you're amazing!<eos> Hang on, Lassie, we'll have you out of there in no time!<eos> Hey!<eos> That lady hawk stole my camera!<eos> How do you know it's a female?<eos> She's circling around.<eos> I think my whole leg just came off.<eos> Lassie, she's coming back this way.<eos> I think she's gonna drop it.

- I've been working with bands for 20 years, so I'm used to vomit, crap, and crying.<eos> Just let me know if you're gonna feed it in front of me.<eos> - Got it.<eos> - So I like that song...<eos> The last one you sang the other night. - Message.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Artist, pixie Dexter, that I've been working with, and I think that your song would be great...<eos> - For h-her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - See, my thought was I would sing it.
- Uh, no, no, I-I just...<eos> - You know, there are a lot of great singers who got their start as songwriters writing songs for other people.<eos> It's not crazy.<eos> - I hear that.<eos> - So my thought was...<eos> Let's get you in the studio with pixie...<eos> Play around with it, see if it's a good fit. - So...<eos> So you want to record my song?<eos> Potentially.<eos> - With this Dixie chick, whatever, singing it?
You'll be fine.<eos> What?<eos> What happened?<eos> What?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What is this?<eos> What is this?<eos> It may be that the girl was infected by bird .<eos> And now a mutation is developing.<eos> We have to take it out, right?
The next day, he will burn the letter, the signed confession given to him by John Wilkes Booth.<eos> Abraham Lincoln has less than 15 hours to live.<eos> You see, I gave her a draught that cured the effect of the draught.<eos> And that draught was a draught that didn't pay the doctor's bill.<eos> Good gracious. What a number of draughts.<eos> You have almost a game of draughts.<eos> - What's the matter?<eos> - That was a joke, that was.<eos> - Where's the joke?<eos> - She don't see it.
You put any more kindling there, I'll put a ball through you.<eos> I could've picked off three or four of your men by now, if I wished to do so.<eos> Draw off your men 50 yards.<eos> - I will not!<eos> - Well, my brave boys, you can prepare a stretcher for me.<eos> Go. Go on.<eos> Save yourself if you can.<eos> Captain, there is a man in here who wishes to surrender awful bad.<eos> Let him hand out his arms!<eos> You carry a carbine and you must hand it out!
It's on the left side and has the appearance more like the cicatrix of a burn than that of a surgical operation.<eos> It was occasioned when I removed a fibroid tumor from his neck.<eos> It is exactly as you have described it.<eos> Yes.<eos> That is he.<eos> That is John Wilkes Booth.<eos> Gentlemen, please, stand where you are.<eos> And perfectly still.<eos> One... two... three.<eos> James Wardell, one of Lafayette Baker's detectives, takes the single glass plate and delivers it to Lafayette Baker.
That's what's happening here.<eos> Want me to fight angela me?<eos> 'cause I will.<eos> Mark, I've never seen this side of you before.<eos> You've never seen a lot of things.<eos> Holy crap.<eos> June!<eos> What's happening here?<eos> My window got stuck,<eos> And since everyone in the building hates us, The landlord refuses to fix it.
Look at Kirk. He's got room to spare.<eos> Spock has total vulcan control over his digestion.<eos> - You wanna hear this or not?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, go.<eos> Okay, finally, Kirk-- he can't take it anymore.<eos> He yorks.<eos> Now it's just down to Chekov and Spock.<eos> But Chekov, you see, he's got a whole fat stack of Quatloos riding on this, and he has figured out a way to win.<eos> He's got Scotty back in the transporter room, locked in on Chekov's stomach.<eos> Every time Chekov eats a pie, Scotty beams it right out of him.
So your memory has returned.<eos> The dream is over.<eos> What?<eos> Get up!<eos> I found you wandering the streets, half starved.<eos> Finally, cruel God sent someone who wasn't repulsed by me.<eos> I brought you to live with me.<eos> Suspecting you would one day be yourself again, I wrote you a letter.<eos> No one escapes from their destiny.<eos> I'll read it so you understand.
Granddad never said.<eos> How did the French react to them?<eos> There weren't many blacks in France.<eos> Who knows? And who cares?<eos> Just forget about it?<eos> Come here.<eos> Let's have a break.<eos> You need it.<eos> This can't go on, Christian.<eos> I like this place, too. And defend it? my way.
I was just like...<eos> Because I remembered walking in there for the first time and seeing all of those other records.<eos> To me, Sound City represents some sort of integrity like a truth, which is very human. Actual people doing this thing that inspired millions and millions of fans all over the place to do the same thing.<eos> That September, the phones just blew up.<eos> I mean, you come in the morning, there'd be, like, 50 messages.<eos> It's like this tidal wave of interest, and it was a no-brainer<eos> - Sound City.<eos> We chose Sound City because "Nevermind" was recorded there.<eos> I had never been in a studio before.<eos> There was a lot of time spent, like, cutting a tape at an angle and taping it together.
Dave, and that's how all this all started.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> To me, it's, like - it's a living, breathing piece of the music that we've made.<eos> It's just as instrumental as any instrument that's run through it.<eos> It's the sound of the records that were made at Sound City.<eos> This thing is a piece of rock 'n' roll history.<eos> I thought that board would just go straight to the Rock 'n' Roll hall of fame.<eos> I thought no one was gonna get that board.<eos> I think they knew, like, I wasn't just gonna bubble-wrap it and stick it in a warehouse.

It's the first thing you look for.<eos> What in the hell would my motive be for helping the same bugs I've been trying to kill for two years?<eos> I see your point.<eos> Uh, there... are some files that I would like you to take a look at.<eos> And here's the list.<eos> There are a lot of names here that I recognize...<eos> Some I know really well... Fought side-by-side with.<eos> Yes, I'm afraid so.<eos> What do you need me for?<eos> Because I've got about 50 possible suspects on that list, and to be candid, I could use some help narrowing it down.
But these people can.<eos> He's out of prison on licence.<eos> If I call the police, he'll go straight back to jail.<eos> I can't do that to him.<eos> Liz, under the Domestic Violence, Crime And Victims Act, charges can be brought against your husband without your permission.<eos> I can make the call.<eos> But it's important for you that you do it yourself.<eos> They can arrange a shelter until he's arrested.<eos> I'm offering you a lifeline.<eos> Take it.
Cover your ears, sweetie.<eos> And that your actions could cost that pretty little girl her head.<eos> And if that happens, there'll be nothing to stop me... from kicking your ass to the traffic department.<eos> Kicking your ass to the traffic department!<eos> Is that clear?<eos> - I'm in a meeting.<eos> - I know, I'm sorry.<eos> This call just came in.<eos> You should hear the tape.<eos> Go on, play it.
What, you think there's some sort of stigma?<eos> I don't, but you certainly do.<eos> You always refused when I suggested it.<eos> Well, not anymore.<eos> I have a lot of friends whose parents have benefited from it.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Look, you have two kids, which means whether or not you and dad get back together, you're at least going to have to communicate.<eos> Hey.<eos> Uh, is it cool if I leave my bike here?<eos> Only one who might steal it is me.
Ah, Bishopwood's claim to fame.<eos> Edward loved the Society, even if the other members didn't love him.<eos> He liked to win, you see.<eos> And then he liked to brag about it.<eos> A lot.<eos> Do you... recognise this?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Don't speak chess.<eos> Do you own a car, Miss Stannington?<eos> I did, before Edward confiscated it.
That was very understanding of you.<eos> It was the worst decision I've ever made.<eos> I wish I'd gone back.<eos> I wish I'd found him, thrown him in the car and dragged him home.<eos> If you think I would do anything to harm my son, you really don't know the man you're dealing with.<eos> We'll need to talk to you again.<eos> If you must.<eos> Mr Robson...<eos> Do you know this game?<eos> I'd recognise it anywhere.
Yeah, we're parking the car right now.<eos> What do you mean, "bring it around front"?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> That's very generous.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> My dad is giving the car to David as a congratulations gift. This car has been a pain in the ass my whole life, but it's pain in the ass.<eos> You know, he always said that one day, it would be mine.<eos> And now he's...<eos> He's just giving it to David?
So that's why I grew out the beard and why I can never shave it.
It's understandable.<eos> It's more than that.<eos> The day before he died, my father and I had a fight.<eos> I said some things that now... I can never take back.<eos> What was the fight about?<eos> His affair.<eos> Your father told you he was having an affair before he died?<eos> He didn't tell me.<eos> I found a letter.<eos> Do you want to read it?
I got a plan to fix it.<eos> You don't want everything going into the roth ira.<eos> 5, 10 grand a year.<eos> I'll set you up with a nice, diversified package.<eos> Low-risk, high-yield.<eos> I think Claire and I have things pretty well under control.<eos> If I brought a senior U.S. congressman into the fund, hoo hoo hoo, that would really up my stock in the company.<eos> We're talking about the old library.<eos> Yeah, what's happening to it?<eos> They gonna tear it down?

I knew that the moment I saw you cuss out the drill sergeant when we were knobs.<eos> The library is a sham.<eos> Higgins asked me a favor.<eos> I asked someone else a favor.<eos> They slapped my name on it.<eos> Politics.<eos> Like everything else.<eos> Not everybody gets asked those favors.<eos> Or knows how to deliver on 'em.<eos> Oh, in 50 years they'll just replace it with something else.
Fifth?<eos> Eighth.<eos> He was a southpaw.<eos> They take longer.<eos> See, it was a title fight.<eos> I held the belt for 18 months.<eos> I used to hang it right up there.<eos> You know?<eos> A good conversation piece.<eos> But with this tough economy, I had to pawn it a little while back to pay for the leaking taps.
What I mean is I wouldn't want you to take matters into your own hands.<eos> Ha, ha. Look at me.<eos> Nobody runs from a fight faster than an old fighter.<eos> What happened to your title fight?<eos> Oh, I knocked it off the hook the other night, busted up the frame.<eos> I'm having it redone.<eos> Thanks for the drink.<eos> You let me know if you need any more of those painkillers.<eos> That's some car.<eos> Look, if you're thinking of stealing from Kai Proctor you may as well take a bullet and put it in your head now.
That should get you started.<eos> - Supplies are inside.<eos> - Shit.<eos> You okay, buddy?<eos> Been trying all morning to get tickets to the Wilco concert at Soldier Field tonight.<eos> - Can't get through.<eos> - Wilco?<eos> Aren't they for, like, dads with receding hairlines and shit?<eos> Come on, Wilco is the beacon of anti-commercialism.<eos> Yeah, because no one wants to buy their whiny music, they gotta give it away for free.
Nick, if I wanted you dead, don't you think I could have done it the second you turned the key?<eos> How do I know you won't kill her?<eos> Because if I did that, you wouldn't have any reason to play, now, would you?<eos> Decide.<eos> You have ten seconds.<eos> Move it.<eos> Move!<eos> All right, I'm here.<eos> Disarm the bomb.<eos> Disarm it, God damn it!
- Oh, would you?<eos> - Yeah, I would.<eos> And then I would proceed to caress your arms and your back and those very, very, very long legs.<eos> It's getting very hot in here.<eos> - Well, maybe you should undress.<eos> - I already am.<eos> Nice.<eos> I need a cigarette.<eos> You quit.<eos> All right, I'm not gonna smoke it, I'll just... suck on it.
- What did he say?<eos> - What will you do with your machine?<eos> I think he said machine.<eos> - Tell me... - He's going to use his machine.<eos> - What the hell is a machine? - And then...<eos> I would caress, uh, your feet.. With that gassed-up machine.<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> Do we write all this down? Yes!<eos> Of course we have to write this down!<eos> And then I'd flip it over and clean out the undercarriage.
It-it was like a-<eos> - I thought it was like a dead man's dream, you know?<eos> You'll never die now, Daniel.<eos> Will you ever die, Tawney?<eos> No.<eos> I'm so glad.<eos> Hey, don't be ashamed.<eos> God is releasing your pain.<eos> Where does it go?<eos> He takes it.
Bring water!<eos> And you fetch wood.<eos> Bastards!<eos> "Practising cruelty."<eos> We don't like to kill, but we have to get used to it.<eos> We begin with killing beetles.<eos> Then we go on to fish.<eos> We grab them by the tail and smash their heads... against the rocks.<eos> Later, we also kill animals that we don't have to kill.<eos> We catch a frog and nail it to a plank.
We don't stop.<eos> Show me.<eos> - Show you what?<eos> Your hands.<eos> You don't have any nails.<eos> They ripped my nails out.<eos> They're rounding up all the men.<eos> I have to get across the border.<eos> We know the border.<eos> There's no way to cross it.
Titles mean a lot to me, but when I got around to reading the fucking book, oh, my God, it's so depressing.<eos> It's like it's Dickensian but not in a good way.<eos> The working classes want to leave a Broadway theater feeling the way they feel when they leave one of my concerts.<eos> - With tinnitus?<eos> - Happy, uplifted, inspired, preferably a little bit horny.<eos> Yeah, well, that's very funny 'cause I'm not feeling very horny right now.<eos> Just homicidal maybe.<eos> Hank, we're gonna need you to burn this draft, just forget all about it.<eos> Chalk it up to a creative miscarriage.<eos> But when you get up tomorrow, you take a fresh page, you put it in your typer, and you start a new one, one that hues closer to the tone of the movie.
Maybe we should combine the two.<eos> [Rock music]<eos> ♪<eos> [Whistles]<eos> Where is it?<eos> Hand it over.<eos> Oh, sit.<eos> Marcy, please.<eos> I don't want to sit, Stu.<eos> I just want you to give me my weed, so I can go home and smoke it.
- Will you be my wife?<eos> Come on!<eos> Say yes!<eos> No?<eos> Nobody?<eos> Really?<eos> No? Then get the fuck off my stage.<eos> Be gone, all of you!<eos> I wrote this next song for my wife, Natalie in hope that she'll forgive me although if she did, I'll probably just bugger it up all over again<eos> But tonight I'm gonna play it for my good friend and collaborator
If you are in trouble, come to me, don't steal from me.<eos> Honest endeavour, together.<eos> This is the Spirit of Selfridge's.<eos> Your ladyship, Mr Colleano to see you.<eos> I'd given up on you.<eos> Shame.<eos> I've got some spatch-cock quail in here.<eos> You've brought spatch-cock quail into my sitting room?<eos> !<eos> Thought I'd serve it up with a salsa verde.
What am I to do, Edmund?<eos> I mourn her.<eos> And because you will not, I must do so alone.<eos> Mr Eagles was kind to me.<eos> He allowed me to speak of her.<eos> To imagine her in heaven.<eos> To imagine a life... beyond this pain.<eos> Would you deny me that?<eos> I would take your pain.<eos> I would amplify it a hundredfold and bear it for you every day of what remains of my life.
Tell you what, I got to go see a fella...<eos> Owes me some money.<eos> Why don't you come along?<eos> Dry run. Let's just see how it goes.<eos> You sell my home?<eos> Not yet.<eos> You set the asking price too high.<eos> I lowered it to $170,000.<eos> It hasn't sold.<eos> It's too high. You want me to just give it away?
- I thought we would have found her by now.<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> Emma had her shot; she didn't take it.<eos> Well, there she is.<eos> - Never mind.<eos> - Where's Emma?<eos> Fixing her lipstick?<eos> What is this, like, a threesome, now?<eos> Seems to be the only explanation I can come up with.<eos> She loved my life so much she up and and stole it.
Emma and Thayer and now Laurel.<eos> It's like I got voted off the island.<eos> What's your story?<eos> 'Cause you're looking a little like you got tossed off an island yourself.<eos> No, don't tell me.<eos> You and Sutton broke up... but you were never really together because you'll never get over Emma.<eos> As far as theories go, that's a pretty good one.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know what I want to do right now?<eos> Steal a golf cart and drive it straight into a pond.
I have his number.<eos> There's a phone right over there by the bed.<eos> Get an ambulance!<eos> [Jordy groans]<eos> The storm windows were padlocked.<eos> The man had a key.<eos> The nanny gave it to him.<eos> He was dressed as a cop.<eos> He hid under one of the AC units nobody knew about.<eos> Except the nanny, who gave it to him.
It's called a paradox, Q.<eos> I'm young enough to believe all kinds of things.<eos> Did you know... more than 33 different aboriginal tribes believe... that the soul resides somewhere in the lower digestive tract?<eos> Absolutely true.<eos> But here's the zinger. None of these tribes have any knowledge of each other's existence.<eos> Coincidence?<eos> Where do you think all these separate peoples got such an idea?<eos> Dysentery.<eos> Q, you're getting to be very funny lately.<eos> Listen up, if you have a soul... which I'm betting you do... this baby will locate it... and connect you with it.
The closest to it I could think of was the person you thought I was in the beginning.<eos> I hope one day...<eos> I remember you'd talk about me like I was this great, beautiful person, and I thought, "Who the fuck is she talking about?"<eos> I think you don't need to worry about...<eos> You saw something in me that didn't exist, or maybe it did.<eos> Maybe you're my higher power.<eos> I don't believe in much, but I believe in you.<eos> ♪<eos> I keep going out every day looking for your turtle.<eos> I really want to find it, but even if I don't, I know you did, and for me, that's good enough.
It's us...<eos> Toby and Bay.<eos> But I was told the car can't be here anymore.<eos> As long as it's painted like that.<eos> What's wrong with how it's painted?<eos> Some kind of anti-graffiti mandate.<eos> Doesn't fit the Buckner image.<eos> So 16-year-olds driving $60,000 cars is fine, but a couple of sea creatures are offensive?<eos> Just move it.<eos> Park it around back please.
Were you indicted?<eos> Actually, I'm on my way to a funeral.<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> Anyone we know?<eos> Yes, as a matter of fact.<eos> It's um... The trash man.<eos> Odd, I could have sworn I saw him this morning.<eos> You know, in my grief, I misspoke.<eos> I meant the mailman.<eos> I would send a sympathy card, but there's no one to deliver it.
And wake us up earlier!<eos> Yeah!<eos> OK, OK!<eos> What the hell...<eos> Mireille, it's Simon.<eos> I'm not sure how to say this.<eos> Help!<eos> So...<eos> There!<eos> I'll get her underwear and wash it at home.
I see.<eos> Any message?<eos> Anyone there?<eos> Antoine, open up!<eos> I know my wife is here!<eos> - Simon?<eos> - How did he get in?<eos> - Camille, open up! - Camille's not here!<eos> - Stop rattling the door!<eos> - Stop blocking it!
Bad idea!<eos> According to my clinical research on drug induced amnesia...<eos> Said the fake scientist...<eos> - Hmm, and what are your parents' names?<eos> - What?<eos> Their names are... um, uh...<eos> Damn it, Krieger, did you drug me?<eos> You don't remember?<eos> Wow, memory is such a fragile thing.<eos> And if Archer's real identity is exposed to him too suddenly, his mind may reject it permanently.
Go downstairs to the basement and start the laundry, will you?<eos> I did it yesterday. You just don't remember me doing it.<eos> Stop being a smart aleck.<eos> Hey, Charlie brown, where's your glasses?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, find them, pronto.<eos> Lisa, have you decided where we're gonna go for your birthday tomorrow?<eos> Ask me tomorrow.<eos> Well, I hope we get there, because the car's not running.<eos> Your dad's been trying to fix it all day.
All right.<eos> Good night, sweetheart.<eos> Good night.<eos> You fill the car up?<eos> Uh...<eos> No.<eos> Dad, as soon as I got in the car,<eos> Paige called, okay, and she was sobbing.<eos> There was nothing else I could do.<eos> Look, it's fine, I'll fill it up right now.
It was good!<eos> - What?<eos> - It was very good.<eos> Continue like this.<eos> What happened to him?<eos> Cauliflower did the trick.<eos> Let's do it again tomorrow.<eos> Pass this.<eos> What is this?<eos> Mr. Fernandes, our ball fell inside the balcony Please can we have it?
No no, I really don't like it.<eos> Why?<eos> He's not anyone you know, why do you care?<eos> Good morning.<eos> How are you?<eos> Good.<eos> You were not at your desk, so I came here.<eos> You were reading in the canteen, I didn't want to bother you.<eos> Your meal exhales a delicious aroma.<eos> I tasted the food just by smelling it!
Auntie!<eos> What does he?<eos> Would you have the cassette of this film, "Saajan"?<eos> So, why?<eos> The songs were good, right?<eos> Not bad.<eos> We can hear it?<eos> Now?<eos> Yes.<eos> You can put it?
- She was so hot!<eos> I was speechless for a minute, you should seen her.<eos> She was looking at me, we locked eyes... - And I thought, I have to save her! - So did you get her digits?<eos> How can I do that during a rescue?<eos> Of course you can, very formally.<eos> But she did take my shirt.<eos> So what?<eos> So what what?<eos> What do you do when you borrow a shirt?<eos> Return it, if it's not Armani.
- What are yöu doing?<eos> Milkha, pass the ball!<eos> Hurry HP!<eos> Pass the ball.<eos> Pick it up!<eos> Pick it up!<eos> Want a broken jaw?<eos> Pick it up!<eos> Pick it up!<eos> Take it!
Foolish boy!<eos> Birds that fly high up don't get attached to small trees.<eos> The sky is the limit.<eos> yöu're off to Australia, a foreign country.<eos> Come on!<eos> Give me a hug.<eos> Hey Milkha.<eos> Our seats are together.<eos> Mahinder, how does one tie this belt?<eos> Tie it the way yöu tie pajamas.
Hey Milkha.<eos> Our seats are together.<eos> Mahinder, how does one tie this belt?<eos> Tie it the way yöu tie pajamas.<eos> Like this.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Hello.<eos> Let me help yöu.<eos> There yöu are.<eos> When do we undo it?
You sure your mum and dad don't know you're here?<eos> They're watching telly.<eos> We could go to the hills.<eos> Have a drink.<eos> The police found the coke.<eos> What?<eos> They were searching the house for stuff about Danny.<eos> What did you tell them?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Well, where did they think you got it from?
Nothing personal.<eos> When you grow up, you tend to get told the world is the way that it is, your life is just to live your life inside the world and try not to bash into the walls too much.<eos> But that's a very limited life.<eos> Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact.<eos> And that is that everything around you that you call life was made up by people that are no smarter than you.<eos> And you can change it.<eos> You can influence it.<eos> You can build your own things, that other people can use.<eos> It's to shake off this erroneous notion that life is just there, and you're just gonna live in it, versus embrace it.<eos> Change it' Improve it.
It's about time I got my clutter out of here, give you a chance to put your stamp on this office.<eos> And now that I'm retired,<eos> I'm thinking of taking up golf.<eos> Oh, I once had a three handicap.<eos> And no one can say I didn't, because there's no one around except me who remembers the damn rules.<eos> Poor bastard.<eos> He's been up there for three hours, hasn't he?<eos> I hate this, Nicky.<eos> I really do.<eos> We have a town charter, and we haven't followed it for years.
I used to take Luke there when he was maybe three.<eos> So what about your family?<eos> What did they do before arkfall?<eos> Dog food.<eos> Dog food?<eos> My family made dog food.<eos> Wait, McCawley. Your old man was... Yes.<eos> "Chow down" Brown McCawley.<eos> How did that jingle go?<eos> I ain't singing it for you.
It's guys like them that made the roaring '20s roar.<eos> Run, you monkey!<eos> And tell your boss we'll have a drink on him, at his Irish wake.<eos> Oh, Benny, no, come on.<eos> In years to come, Bugsy and Meyer will make history.<eos> Sid -- he'll just make trouble.<eos> Wait.<eos> I can't find my gun.<eos> I think it's flooded.<eos> We're here to hijack the booze, Benny, not blow it up and us with it.
You'll see her soon.<eos> Yvonne's keeping her safe and sound.<eos> Yvonne?<eos> What...<eos> Wallace's nurse?<eos> We met in a V.A. survivors group two years ago.<eos> Pretty much taken us all that time to put this together.<eos> You forced Wallace to put the... bomb in those men.<eos> (Sighs) God, it was a test run.<eos> Yeah. For putting it in me.
I can't believe it.<eos> What?<eos> It finally happens and I'm stuck in a fucking elevator... with you.<eos> Captain.<eos> - What's the update?<eos> - There's gonna be a short delay before we can get you out, ma'am.<eos> Why? What's going on?<eos> Why are the phones down, the radios?<eos> I don't have that information right now.<eos> As soon as I do, I will pass it on, ma'am.
- Are you ignoring me, Private?<eos> - Yes, I am, sir.<eos> That took about a minute.<eos> You get the rest out that fast, it's gonna take about eight.<eos> The radiation hits in five.<eos> - You do the fucking math!<eos> - Good point.<eos> Diego, help me.<eos> All right.<eos> If you think that hatch is gonna save you, you can close it as soon as we're out.
You look good.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You guys still over on Columbia St?<eos> That's long back.<eos> My, my grandma passed away.<eos> Awe Yeah.<eos> I'm just back kind a taking care of things. Get the house ready to sell.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I remember that house.<eos> You want to see it?
- What song was that?<eos> - It's called "Hang God."<eos> It's about hanging God, because he's a fascist.<eos> - But it is a Christian song.<eos> - Are we doing our song, or what?<eos> If you want to hang God, he has to exist, or you couldn't hang him.<eos> So they believe in God and must be Christian.<eos> - Let's play ours now.<eos> - So you have the melody?<eos> We play it, not differently but...
I also noticed you made significant breakthroughs last year with Showcase, and enjoyed the musical.<eos> You saw all of that?<eos> Mm-hmm, I see everything.<eos> Do you know if Sir Jeffrey shares your opinion?<eos> There are a lot of factors at play in his decision-making.<eos> So you're saying I'm not getting a fill-in role?<eos> Even though I was the best today?<eos> Well, is there anything I can do to improve my chances at the end of the year?<eos> Sir Jeffrey has a list of who fits his vision.<eos> He starts it when you enter first year and then he revises it for injury or change of body shape.
So, what did you think of that book?<eos> I prefer non-fiction, but I liked it.<eos> You read the whole thing?<eos> I liked the part where Scout says,<eos> "You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view, until you climb into his skin and walk around in it."<eos> I don't remember that.<eos> Page 177, 12 lines from the bottom.<eos> So... first, I roll.<eos> Five.<eos> I take my piece and move it five spaces.
Max!<eos> You'll never guess what I've got in here.<eos> Give me a hint.<eos> The army.<eos> What's that?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You wanna know what I brought you?<eos> Yeah, and who you fought with.<eos> Ta-da!<eos> You fought to get it back?
How does it go?<eos> Are you stupid and a homo?<eos> Answer me!<eos> No answer?<eos> Now you're gonna sing it on the beach.<eos> - Leave me alone.<eos> - You're a fucking snitch and Jon's my friend.<eos> You brought this on yourself, so spare me your tears.<eos> Sing the fucking sonatina!<eos> Or would you rather take it in the ass?
- I've got a seal.<eos> - Get us up!<eos> You're not going anywhere!<eos> Not anywhere, bro!<eos> Bell on surface!<eos> - I blacked out. What the hell happened?<eos> - I don't know. I don't know!<eos> Trunk is equalised.<eos> Get the hypo from the equipment lock, Jørgen.<eos> Push it hard and deep. As deep as it goes.
We're still alive, aren't we?<eos> No point in hiding!<eos> There's nowhere to go.<eos> Come on, let's work this out.<eos> Things got really messed up between me, and Max, and Jesse.<eos> You're running from the wrong person.<eos> I don't know what Jesse did, but I'm no killer.<eos> [Cocks rifle and fires]<eos> Where's your gun?<eos> Somebody took it.
- She's with the gunmen.<eos> - Put her through.<eos> Janie, this is Brock Lotus.<eos> You okay?<eos> Janie?<eos> Tell him it's simple.<eos> He says to tell you it's simple.<eos> We want a car and an easy way out.<eos> They want a car with a way out.<eos> We want it within an hour.

Yeah, no shit.<eos> Now where we at with them gift baskets?<eos> We locked and loaded?<eos> Whoo. Looking good.<eos> Moose Munch. Coffee macadamia toffee.<eos> - You know what the move is.<eos> - What's the move? Put my motion picture personal autobiographical screenplays into Guy Young's gift basket.<eos> That's how the Antwone Fisher story was made.<eos> Autobiographical screenplay, Kenny?<eos> When do I get to read it?
He's had a mild seizure.<eos> That doesn't seem to bother you.<eos> I said it was mild.<eos> Are you the man who claimed to be the Chesapeake Ripper?<eos> Why do you say "claimed"?<eos> Because you're not.<eos> You know you're not, and you don't know much more about who you are beyond that.<eos> Are you the Ripper?<eos> A terrible thing... to have your identity taken from you.<eos> Well, I'm taking it back, one piece at a time.
God didn't give him insight;<eos> God gave him a tumor.<eos> He's just a man whose brain is playing tricks on him.<eos> You are not unlike this killer.<eos> My brain is playing tricks on me?<eos> You want to feel such sweet and easy peace.<eos> The angel maker wants that same peace.<eos> He hopes to feel his way cautiously inside and then find it's endless, all around him.<eos> He's gonna be disappointed.<eos> You accept the impossibility of such a feeling, whereas the angel maker is still chasing it.

It was there this morning.<eos> Well. Is Mr. Silvestri working<eos> - today?<eos> - He's not on the schedule.<eos> Is there GPS on that ambulance?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Encrypted messaging, or remote tracking?<eos> We can't afford that kind of hardware.<eos> We use consumer grade.<eos> - Digital trunk system. - Yeah.<eos> Jack. If the ambulance radio is on, I can use a DF sweep to find it.
Every penny.<eos> What you have here is all you have.<eos> Let them take all his money.<eos> I don't want any of it.<eos> You can make your own money.<eos> How much would I get if you wrote a book about me?<eos> About my dad?<eos> Plenty.<eos> Do you still want to tell my story?<eos> I think you need to tell your own story, but I am the one to help you tell it.

If you go to Jack, then you murder Abigail's future.<eos> Do I need to call my lawyer, Will?<eos> We can tell no one.<eos> What we are doing here is the right thing.<eos> In time, this will be the only story any of us cares to tell.<eos> I feel terrible Ms. Lounds.<eos> Never entered my head you might be a vegetarian.<eos> A lapse on my behalf.<eos> Research always delivers benefits.<eos> If it contradicts a good story, hell, publish it anyway.
Because...<eos> I want you to have fond memories of me when you go to Timmins.<eos> You're still going, right?<eos> I got the letter right here.<eos> Oh, let me see.<eos> Whoa. Wow. You must be really excited.<eos> Yeah. Of course I'm excited.<eos> I'm stoked.<eos> Chris, you haven't even opened up the letter.<eos> I'm savoring it, all right?
Yes, I did that. Was that wrong?<eos> For the first time I had the pleasure of having an 8-cylinder car.<eos> The possible combinations of eight sparkplug caps on eight sparkplugs are 40,320 if I remember my math correctly.<eos> And only one of these will make the car run, which gave me all the time I needed.<eos> Beethoven, huh?<eos> He was certainly very good, but you know, he couldn't write a fugue.<eos> You think so?<eos> Well, yeah, I think so.<eos> It would be more precise to say that Beethoven renewed the fugue,<eos> that he was such a visionary that the old Bach purists, they accused him of not mastering it.
three.<eos> Four.<eos> Five.<eos> Six.<eos> I'd seen through K's knot technique, so I was able to losen my position a bit to move my pelvis and thereby stimulate my clitoris against the cover of the book.<eos> And when you came home,<eos> Jerome and the child were gone?<eos> I haven't Marcel since.<eos> This sentimentality ...<eos> I hate it.
You won't win either, but I was at least attempting to represent...<eos> Well I don't know!<eos> Not just "bollocks to everything".<eos> If you were preaching revolution, well that'd be something, but you're not because that would require courage and a mindset.<eos> And what have you got?<eos> Who are you?<eos> What are you for?<eos> Morning.<eos> So, final push.<eos> You remind everyone that's got the app that if they recommend it to a friend it unlocks a little fez for Waldo.
Gina, why don't you let David drive for a bit so you can, um, Have a rest?<eos> - Do you want me to?<eos> - I don't mind.<eos> Fancy wedding, huh?<eos> Sounds like business is going well.<eos> Better to be the agency owner than another photo journalist, slugging it through war zones.<eos> - Have you seen his pictures?<eos> - Yeah. Your book was fantastic.<eos> I mean, it's one of the best I've ever seen in my life. I swear.<eos> Your sister used to tell me i spent too much time documenting life and not enough time living it, so i'm working on that.
It's not important.<eos> Leave it for later.<eos> I have a lot.<eos> I brought two baskets full.<eos> I haven't done anything else but look for guavas.<eos> You're going to get well.<eos> We have much to do together.<eos> Many people to help.<eos> Give me your hand, my love.<eos> You feel it?
I dreamed about you again last night.<eos> I guess I dream about you every night and most days too.<eos> I hold your face in my mind.<eos> I put your voice together in my head.<eos> I think about your hair getting longer.<eos> I think about your belly getting bigger.<eos> I hear people talk about regret', but I haven't got any.<eos> I don't think poorly on the things that I've done.<eos> We did what we did, and that is who we are.<eos> They're gonna cross out this sentence before you get to read it, but I know you know what it says.

- You named your dog, Dog? No.<eos> He doesn't have a name.<eos> Are you OK?<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> You haven't been here since...<eos> Why don't you look around?<eos> The house just sat on the market while I was in the foster system.<eos> Released to me when I turned 18.<eos> I was the only homeowner in the freshman dorms when I started school.<eos> I'm thinking we should try and sell it, though.
I'll make a short speech.<eos> Once I've announced you, leave a short pause, then come out.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Tonight we'll be presenting you with a whole feast of music.<eos> I'll also be introducing you to a young new talent, my co-performer.<eos> Here she is... Neþe!<eos> - I asked for two separate rooms though.<eos> - But the rooms are separate.<eos> There's just a door in-between.<eos> Close it and you have separate rooms.
I got some things for breakfast.<eos> - How do you like your eggs? - Soft-boiled.<eos> Not quite soft-boiled actually.<eos> You know, so the yolk's runny and the white is just set.<eos> I've had worse happen before, you know.<eos> In Istanbul.<eos> I was doing gigs in Kalamýþ at the time.<eos> Selim arrived, God rest his soul.<eos> The backstage door was open.<eos> I usually kept it closed.
Bienvenue a maison par la mer.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> I'm looking for miss April Malloy.<eos> That's me.<eos> My name is Bob Johnson.<eos> I'm an attorney representing Miranda Nickleby.<eos> What's this?<eos> Proof of Paul Malloy's paternity of Scott Nickleby.<eos> I never asked for proof.<eos> No, but we will have to provide it when we sue Paul for child support.
Sweetie, take that one.<eos> Don't lose mater, though.<eos> He's your favorite.<eos> Thank you, mommy.<eos> So how do you want to do this?<eos> By answering a few questions first.<eos> Shoot.<eos> Did you know Paul was married?<eos> When I checked him into the hotel I used to work at, I did notice that he was wearing a wedding band.<eos> I also noticed that he wasn't wearing it when he took me to dinner that night.
Oh. Oh.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Uh, you said the doctor would only be another minute?<eos> -Yep.<eos> -Yeah, that was 30 minutes ago.<eos> Patients who make same-day appointments sometimes have to wait.<eos> Until the second coming?<eos> Shouldn't you be on your way to court right now?<eos> Are you still up to speed on the Sullivan case?<eos> I spent the last year prepping for it with you.
Forget it, Mom.<eos> What is happening?<eos> Is everybody doing it?<eos> Mom, shut up!<eos> Come out!<eos> You look beautiful!<eos> Look at you two.<eos> Come on!<eos> We're not buying the same dress, Mom!<eos> We won't wear it at the same time.
Exactly?<eos> Let me ask you a question.<eos> When people ask why we got divorced, what do you say?<eos> I say I don't think you and I should have been together.<eos> What about Fran? Did you talk to her about us?<eos> Right. She's your wife.<eos> That was fun?<eos> I started this blanket when you were five.<eos> I don't know what I was thinking about this color.<eos> I'm going to finish it, so you can take it with you.
What color?<eos> Black.<eos> Look, I'm just sayin', you might not want to tempt fate.<eos> Although you obviously want to tempt me.<eos> In your dreams, Sullivan.<eos> Well, not to do your job, but I'm guessing the two bullet holes to the chest are what killed him.<eos> What's your guess on that?<eos> Hey, hey. Let me have a look.<eos> Well, it looks like heroin.<eos> Aren't you gonna taste it like all the cool cops do?
Look, I know most guys hate that, but I'm totally cool with it.<eos> Like, I like the idea that I'd be your first.<eos> I'm sorry, but it's not something for you to be "cool with" or not.<eos> It's about me and what I want.<eos> But I don't see why the virgin thing has to be a big deal.<eos> Your virginity is just something you get out of the way so you can start having fun.<eos> Well, I don't see it that way at all.<eos> Sex means more to me than that.<eos> I don't want to lose my virginity in the back of a car with some guy who's pressuring me.<eos> I wanna lose it to someone who thinks its special, someone who thinks I'm special.
You okay?<eos> How are you doing?<eos> I just have my next round of chemo in four days.<eos> I hate feeling bad all the time.<eos> I can't pollute, I give a hoot.<eos> So I made the bartering deal of the century, and I got us this pedicab.<eos> Lydia is your new tutor.<eos> I'll try to make this a painless process.<eos> Tell me about college life.<eos> I'm just not feeling it yet.
Oh, look, don't you laugh.<eos> You wore this almost as much as I did.<eos> - What, no... no, I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> - Ooh, girl. - You called it your "flag tie."<eos> You used to... you used to love to rub the silk against your "wittle" nose.<eos> I was probably just rubbing away a booger - or something. - Okay.<eos> Do me a favor and put that out in the car.<eos> Has anybody seen my green dress shirt?<eos> I wanna wear it in Detroit.

That's a killer coffin.<eos> That's the point.<eos> I mean, death doesn't have to be dowdy.<eos> Look at the Egyptians, they knew how to make it shine.<eos> I'm sorry about your friend.<eos> But if you're gonna be an artist, you have to learn to tap into what's going on in your life.<eos> I have done some of my best collections after being dumped by some very hot boyfriends.<eos> Trust me.<eos> This is not the time to give up on your vision.<eos> It's the time to find it, work it.
And all I've ever wanted to do is save her life.<eos> But, um... I can't.<eos> That's not how our story's gonna end.<eos> But I have to believe that there is somebody else out there who I can help.<eos> And maybe they have a brother who will get to be with them for a whole, long lifetime because of me.<eos> Hey. Hi.<eos> Remember me?<eos> I... I brought my wedding dress in here the other day, and now I really wish I hadn't.<eos> I just...<eos> I wanna hang onto it for a little bit longer.

I can't.<eos> That's not how our story's gonna end.<eos> But I have to believe that there is somebody else out there who I can help.<eos> And maybe they have a brother who will get to be with them for a whole, long lifetime because of me.<eos> Hey.

I brought my wedding dress in here the other day, and now I really wish I hadn't.<eos> I just...<eos> I wanna hang onto it for a little bit longer.<eos> I'll buy it back if I have to.
You gotta set me up with a whole new life in, like, Topeka where I get to be whatever I want, like a master electrician... or a guidance counselor.<eos> Don't judge, bro. I got shit to offer.<eos> You are shit.<eos> I'd make a great stone mason.<eos> Is it possible for you to draw a breath without speaking?<eos> You're an uptight motherfucker.<eos> What's your blood pressure like, man?<eos> Fuck.<eos> I gotta take a piss.<eos> Well, put it back when you're done.
Then it looks like Tabitha could be our killer after all.<eos> Well...<eos> hate to say I told you so.<eos> There's a lot of things I'm sure you hate.<eos> That's not one of them.<eos> Okay, the victim drowned.<eos> Witnesses say she dove into the middle of the lake but apparently could not swim.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, yeah, just this shirt's a little tight.<eos> Well, try to keep it on?
Lucullus battles Mithridates near the Black Sea.<eos> Antonius sails against the pirates plaguing Crete.<eos> Pompey yet struggles with the renegade.<eos> Sertorius in Espainia.<eos> The resources of the Senate are drained by these conflicts.<eos> We have not the men nor the coin to procure them.<eos> There is one among us who could fund endeavor from his own purse. And never feel sting of its cost.<eos> I had hoped to avoid involving the man.<eos> We would not be beholden to him any more than you, Metellus.<eos> Produce alternative, and we shall seize upon it.
They don't wanna do all the drama that accompanies trying to be a solo artist.<eos> Actually, very interesting, if you're talking about background singers, because Lisa made recordings as a solo artist and she's a brilliant entertainer.<eos> She's really funny.<eos> Sings her butt off.<eos> Could sing alone all day long, but doesn't particularly want to.<eos> Hola.<eos> I don't wanna go to school.<eos> I remember when my mom took me to kindergarten.<eos> I told the teacher, it's like, "I wrote a song," right?<eos> "I wanna sing it for the class."
Ready for this?<eos> Usher:<eos> Danielle -- she knew who she wanted When she woke up this morning and put her boots on.<eos> But anyway, I figured why not go for it?<eos> Can't wait to get back To my home state of nashville, though.<eos> Usher: I never thought that I would disgrace myself<eos> And call nashville a state.<eos> But you know what?<eos> Sometimes your mouth is moving faster than your brain.<eos> You got to slow it down.
That's... That's tragic.<eos> It really is...<eos> I just don't get it.<eos> - Hi, this is Anna...<eos> - Hi, Anna, it's Christopher.<eos> - Hi there!<eos> - Is this a bad time?<eos> - No, not at all.<eos> - OK, good. Listen, I felt we didn't quite finish our last conversation.<eos> So I was wondering if we could finish it over a cup of coffee?
- I'll be damned.<eos> I was at Anna Odell's a few days ago to see the film and have a chat.<eos> But you must've tried to form some impression of me?<eos> Anna told me what she thought about you, showed me photos and stuff.<eos> So I have formed some sort of impression.<eos> - But how did you... Thanks.<eos> - There's Facebook, you know. - So I just went into Facebook.<eos> - You checked me out on Facebook?<eos> You didn't go in to steal my identity, did you?<eos> Or like, copy it, somehow... and documentarily try to create as accurate a picture of me as possible?
Yeah, I do.<eos> When I was 14, my very best friend in the world was riding his bicycle and he accidently crashed into this girl I liked.<eos> Her name was Tatiana.<eos> We went to school together, though we hadn't ever talked.<eos> But I liked her from afar.<eos> Anyway, my best friend accidently crashed into her.<eos> She got banged up, got a black eye, crying, the whole thing.<eos> I went over to my friend, took the bike from him, lifted it up and smashed it over his head.<eos> Then I stomped on his hand with my boot until every bone was broken.<eos> Then I took a rock and smashed it so hard into his face, he not only lost most of his teeth but most of his jaw as well.
Aw, fuck!<eos> A deal's a deal, a bet's a bet and a dick doorstop is a dick doorstop.<eos> Lestor, come on.<eos> I hate you, Dom.<eos> I always have.<eos> You killed Bernard.<eos> You can't cut off my dick because of a fucking cat.<eos> - Yes, I can.<eos> - No, you can't.<eos> OK, no, I can't, you're right, but I can cut it off cos you said you could open my safe in 10 minutes and you didn't.
- Your manager here...<eos> - Go, go, go.<eos> Darren, says nobody needs to get hurt.<eos> Police.<eos> Put the gun down now.<eos> Or what?<eos> You'll shoot us?<eos> Put the gun down on the floor.<eos> Oh, I don't think so.<eos> I'm taking it with me.
You got a 340, which in clinical trials is a score routinely bested by monkeys.<eos> Sam... don't worry, okay?<eos> You don't need to go to college like the rest of us.<eos> You have a really great body.<eos> You could be a personal trainer. You could... be a greeter at Abercrombie.<eos> You could be a greeter at Abercrombie's corporate headquarters...<eos> Whatever you want to do... but meanwhile, my future looks bright. I'm gonna graduate.<eos> I'll go to Harvard or Princetown or MITT or Stanford and Son or the University of California at Charles Barkley's House, 'cause evidently<eos> Your audition was great, Rachel.<eos> I don't need to hear you read it again.
Blaine asked me to look into something for you.<eos> Come on in and have a seat.<eos> This is a very small sampling of colleges that don't require SAT or ACT scores.<eos> And they're really good schools, Sam.<eos> They're schools that recognise that a test score isn't always the best measure of your intelligence.<eos> Or creativity.<eos> And you can always take the SATs again if you want.<eos> You know, a lot of kids do that.<eos> Yeah, well, let's say I somehow get into college somewhere.<eos> I still can't afford it.
See, traditionally only single girls line up to catch the bouquet.<eos> She loves me.<eos> I am single.<eos> You live with a guy.<eos> She loves me not. Have you been drinking?<eos> You know, you were the one who told me to stop moping around and being such a sad sack.<eos> She loves me.<eos> A-And it got me thinking about Will and Emma.<eos> About how relationships are a lot like flowers.<eos> If you find the right seed, put it in good soil, give it water and sunlight...
Vitamin E and wild yams.<eos> Yes, uh, has anybody, uh, seen Sam?<eos> Yeah, I think he's behind that curtain.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> What's up, Marley?<eos> Brad?<eos> Uh, I wrote a song.<eos> I don't know if it's any good.<eos> I just...<eos> I want to hear it out loud.
I don't know if it's any good.<eos> I just...<eos> I want to hear it out loud.<eos> And no, or bad Taylor Swift boyfriend drama.<eos> It's about how much friends like you mean to me.<eos> Lord, I am crying already.<eos> (soft laughter)<eos> I just saw how upset you guys got after Mr. Shue yelled at us, and you three seemed to take the worst part of it.<eos> So, I wrote this song to make you feel better, as corny as that sounds.<eos> Will you sing it with me?
Is-is that even safe?<eos> Probably not.<eos> So we'll just take the oath.<eos> Repeat after me.<eos> I, Fruity Fonzie and adult baby Robin...<eos> BOTH:<eos> I, Fruity Fonzie and adult baby Robin do solemnly swear...<eos> BOTH:. ..do solemnly swear to never put a hex on Coach Roz Washington.<eos> To never To never hex on Coach Roz Washington.<eos> Causing her to bring a gun to school so she gets real clumsy and drops it and it goes off twice in a row.

Yes.<eos> (whooping and cheering)<eos> All right, let's review.<eos> What are y'all gonna do at regionals?<eos> Riff, run and grunt!<eos> Emote!<eos> Commit!<eos> Step up to the plate and embrace our talent.<eos> And just like my boo Miss Mercedes Jones, we're gonna treat every note we sing and every breath we take with a little something-something we in the business of show simply call "passion."<eos> And passion can be a scary thing, but we shouldn't run or hide from it because passion is...
♪ My cup, my cup<eos> ♪ Sayin' "What's up?"<eos> ♪ To my cup, my cup<eos> ♪ More of a friend...<eos> "My Cup" is one of a kind, but we're going with Marley's song.<eos> Oh, come on, boo.<eos> Two thumbs down.<eos> The only way to polish that turd of a song is with my angelic alto voice.<eos> Whoa.<eos> So I demand to sing it as a solo.
Let's get some nice iced coffees, and maybe a little brownie or something yummy,<eos> - and then we can go by all the A.T...<eos> - Okay, this is not a date.<eos> We are trying to get a menace off the streets.<eos> Do you get that?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Hey. Are you... thirsty?<eos> No. Just dropping off an abandoned urn.<eos> With ashes in it?<eos> Yeah. I'm gonna leave it here while I try to track down the family.
You adored your wife?<eos> Here husbands and wives seem to love each other a lot.<eos> Virginie loved her husband a lot, I love mine a lot.<eos> Sally loves hers a lot.<eos> Belkacem loved hers a lot, you loved your wife a lot.<eos> It all fits.<eos> But Gérald is alive.<eos> Isn't it great to have a husband who's alive?<eos> You want the photo?<eos> Take it!
This painting is the evidence.<eos> Look at them.<eos> For and Against at each other's throats.<eos> How on earth did the damn Quakers find their way in here?<eos> You are a brave man, negotiating these quarters on the eve of yourjudgment.<eos> Finally you are to speak. If England is destroyed, we shall blame you.<eos> ...religion not being the only guardian of our morality.<eos> Of course not. There is self-responsibility.<eos> And failing that, does the law not have a duty?<eos> Does the Bench and Parliament not have a duty to uphold and create the laws that progress our morality not retard it?
And you, sir, is your decision also final?<eos> Yes.<eos> Therefore, you are hereby divorced as specified by Art. 230 of the Civil Code.<eos> I ratify the appended document, which will be attached to the judgment...<eos> Please turn it off.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Marie, it's me.<eos> They've brought the suitcase.<eos> It's broken.<eos> I don't know if something's missing, if I should accept it or not.
Marie, it's me.<eos> They've brought the suitcase.<eos> It's broken.<eos> I don't know if something's missing, if I should accept it or not.<eos> Call me back.<eos> -Okay?<eos> -What if something's missing?<eos> Doesn't he have insurance?<eos> Don't know.<eos> What do we do, then? Will you take it or should I return it to the airport?
But I'm not Vivian.<eos> I'm not in love with you.<eos> So I don't automatically think everything you say is true and brilliant.<eos> Look, I wanna help you, but...<eos> I need the evidence Vivian promised.<eos> The whole Bowers family must be freaking out now that this thing's deemed a murder.<eos> Keep an eye out, all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can't believe Julian Bowers gave you a car.<eos> Yeah, I wanna give it back.

He was extracting rocks. The purpose of the rocks was not ascertained.<eos> What was the outcome?<eos> He was questioned and released.<eos> He was labeled a known offender.<eos> Then he has been tagged.<eos> Initiate location protocol.<eos> Find his address.<eos> Chip number 784651.<eos> Search the apartment.<eos> He has most likely removed his chip. That is why we could not track it.
He's in the number six stairwell.<eos> B-Unit, cover the 61st Street exit.<eos> Subject is moving on foot.<eos> Repeat, he's in the number six stairwell.<eos> He knows that we know.<eos> You're saying we can't complete the plan because we're missing one single piece?<eos> Without the initiating reactor there's no way we can open the wormhole.<eos> There's simply not enough energy.<eos> I thought the rocks provided the energy.<eos> To sustain the reaction, not to trigger it.
Please, start working on tables, not with the laptop always on your legs...<eos> Just like you, I ended up hating the white sheets.<eos> I'm really sorry for letting you alone with all the burden,<eos> I wish things had been different for you.<eos> Wendy, on the first drawer on the kitchen I left career information.<eos> Choose a career and if you regret it, it's OK! You're allowed to have bad decisions.<eos> Please, use a bra, you cannot live without wearing one.<eos> Sunday afternoons are nicer than you think.<eos> And remember, you cannot hide from your troubles.<eos> Mariana, don't wait 'til the trash can is full in order to take it out because the kitchen begins to stink...
Oh, I'm sorry, Jimmy, I just...<eos> Wow, that was really good.<eos> Jimmy Goodwin, if you can hear me...<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't care if you can hear me.<eos> You are not my problem.<eos> Besides, how much trouble could you possibly get into in Granby, New Hampshire on a Tuesday afternoon at...?<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> He stole Mom's watch, he stole Mom's watch right off my wrist.<eos> He's probably out pawning it as we speak.
Sorry I'm late.<eos> But what about my close-up? ! Uh-huh.<eos> Double shift last night.<eos> Two hours each way to the hospital.<eos> I didn't even get a chance to see Kate, but that's okay.<eos> I feel amazing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry, they're both for me.<eos> (Scoffs)<eos> Remove your hand or I will break it!
You need to learn to forgive yourself.<eos> I did.<eos> Wanna know how?<eos> You spent a week in a mental institution.<eos> - Four days was not a week, and I escaped...<eos> - Escaped in a laundry bin.<eos> To film that pantyhose commercial.<eos> What is up with you two?<eos> You are eating tiny jams with your tiny jam spoon, and Max is violently grating cheddar.<eos> Your mother unleashed a wellspring of emotion in me, and I have nowhere else to put it.
What about dairy farming?"<eos> "What with?" he said.<eos> "Maybe we can sell you so that we could buy a cow."<eos> I knew he didn't mean it.<eos> But I also knew that if we were going to survive, we had to do something.<eos> And what really mattered was what Joe said to me before he went.<eos> He said it was down to me to look after everyone.<eos> He made you responsible.<eos> I... he... he sent us a postcard.<eos> Would you like to see it?
You're taking away her spirit.<eos> Well, of course.<eos> What did you think?<eos> She has to surrender.<eos> She has to be taught to make the will of the man her own.<eos> How else do you think she can be cured?<eos> I think you're after power for its own sake.<eos> You're not interested in curing Caro at all.<eos> I'm going to forgive that remark.<eos> Put it down to youth and displaced anger.
It's common courtesy to include everyone in a room in a conversation.<eos> I do it with my very youngest pupils so I'll ask that you pay me the same respect.<eos> So... this conscience you claim to have is not a Christian conscience?<eos> The Bible is full of God telling his tribe to go and kill people belonging to other tribes.<eos> And he's particular about ordering the murder of women and children.<eos> Infants, I think he says.<eos> And he's even more particular, on one occasion, about sparing virgins so that they may be brought back as prizes.<eos> He's not a peaceable God and it would be hypocrisy for me to rely on the sixth commandment just as it's hypocrisy for Christians to believe in it and then go and kill each other in France.<eos> You're not helping yourself, Eyre.<eos> I'm just telling the truth as I see it.
I think you really did save my pathetic little life.<eos> I thought you spoke to Charlotte every night.<eos> Jealous?<eos> Me? In your dreams.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I'm worried about you.<eos> Since you've been on board we've had one catastrophe after another.<eos> And you're right:<eos> I have to find out the prophecy.<eos> And where will you find it?
It's the symbol for the fine structure constant of the universe, and that right there is bad news.<eos> Why?<eos> [Evan]:<eos> This place belongs to Howard Kanan.<eos> Guy's a legend.<eos> Key patents in mobile communications, medical imaging, remote oil-field sensing... Every arena he worked in, he was brilliant.<eos> Certifiable genius.<eos> Genius?<eos> Like he could understand how that thing works?<eos> We've got to find that creature and get it out of here before Kanan sees it.
Among other things.<eos> Sutton said that a stone kept him from aging.<eos> - Not just him.<eos> - Clearly.<eos> And now you've got...<eos> Do you mind?<eos> Oh, just half the stone?<eos> Where's the other half?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But I need to find it.
...he's been taken.<eos> You mean Alfie?<eos> The wiener-on-a-stick kid?<eos> Yes.<eos> I...<eos> I heard his distress call this morning.<eos> On angel radio?<eos> I thought you shut that down?<eos> My penance, it's going well.<eos> And I thought it was time to turn it back on.
What is it?<eos> Loosely translated? My heart.<eos> That's not impossible at all.<eos> Not my literal heart, feathers.<eos> Something I love. The spell calls for me to kill it.<eos> -A sacrifice.<eos> -Precisely.<eos> The book will grant freedom from the curse, but it wants something in return.<eos> -Then give it.<eos> -Bring me something I love, I'll kill it. I want my freedom too much to make a fuss over that.
Yeah, good point.<eos> You remember Tracy went on a killing spree after reading that?<eos> You think it's a bad idea?<eos> I think Malia almost getting run down by a car could've been bad.<eos> Well, that's why you guys haven't finished it, right?<eos> We're going to.<eos> Scott, I came here hoping to find a pack.<eos> I wasn't planning on watching one fall apart.<eos> The book's all we've got.<eos> Then I'll read it too.
The book's all we've got.<eos> Then I'll read it too.<eos> My mom's book club usually has more wine.<eos> Well, they also probably didn't read books that cause violent hallucinations.<eos> That's why Malia's here.<eos> So none of us go running into traffic?<eos> Or worse.<eos> Like what happened to Judy.<eos> Chapter 14.<eos> Maybe I should have my mother read it.
Oh, right.<eos> Do you know why people in Japan answer the phone "moshi moshi"?<eos> Yeah, but there's a reason why you have to say it twice on the phone.<eos> Because according to Japanese folklore, fox spirits have difficulty with language.<eos> And the way that you prove that you're not a fox, when you answer the phone, you say "moshi" twice.<eos> The important part is...<eos> "Moshi moshi" confuses Kitsunes because it's a language trick.<eos> So is the book.<eos> You know, it's just one long language trick.<eos> That's why I can't read it?
Scott, slow down.<eos> Just think for a second, okay?<eos> Mason should be going.<eos> Liam's my best friend.<eos> I'm going.<eos> Oh, did you suddenly get super wolf powers?<eos> I wasn't aware of that development.<eos> Well, if you're not going, I could use the help.<eos> No, I'm coming just as soon as I talk to my dad.<eos> They're moving the body and he wants to make sure that this time no one steals it.
Then this might take a while.<eos> You tell me, man.<eos> You're the mechanic.<eos> If the gas tank didn't rupture and nothing electrical was burned, then how did the fire start?<eos> Spontaneously combusted?<eos> That's your answer?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Dad, you gotta leave the body, okay?<eos> Leave it and let whoever wants to take it just take it.
Not from you.<eos> You know what's going on.<eos> Don't you?<eos> I know that I'd like to see you get through senior year with passing grades.<eos> You know more than that.<eos> I think you need to focus more on your schoolwork.<eos> All of you.<eos> So, if this place is so important, how come you didn't want to show it to me before?<eos> Well, the problem is it's not easy to find.<eos> Should we put it in the GPS?

Even though we both know, you never needed him.<eos> You hate me now, but you'll get it eventually.<eos> This is the hard part.<eos> 'Cause you can't help Scott and save your dad's life.<eos> You've still got time, Stiles.<eos> You've still got time.<eos> He's using you, Liam.<eos> He wants you to be the Alpha because he can't take the power from me.<eos> Only you can.<eos> But once you do, he'll take it from you.
It's not illegal to close an account, Detective.<eos> What's illegal is monitoring her financials<eos> - without a warrant.<eos> - Please.<eos> Main Justice wants to shut down our murder investigation<eos> - and we have to play by the rules?<eos> - Yes, we do.<eos> I know you want to solve this, Marty, but you're taking it way too personally.<eos> Look, she knows she's gonna be indicted.<eos> That money is on its way out of country, and Agent Keen is leaving right behind it.
I will leave you here to rot.<eos> We'll come back for them.<eos> We're never going back there, right?<eos> No, we're not.<eos> You've been a pawn in a game that I've now lost interest in playing.<eos> You're no ordinary girl, Sarah Salvatore.<eos> - Why would you call me that?<eos> - I have something for you.<eos> The cure to vampirism.<eos> I knew you wanted it for Elena.
I just had to let myself be sad for a minute.<eos> What if things could be different?<eos> What if you could change everything.<eos> They're not, and I can't.<eos> Nothing's changed.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> This better be important.<eos> So I called my dad to let him know that Kai's gone, but all he wants to know is where the ascendant is.<eos> We have to destroy it.
This better be important.<eos> So I called my dad to let him know that Kai's gone, but all he wants to know is where the ascendant is.<eos> We have to destroy it.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Before you answer that, I should probably skip to the part where I already gave it to Lily.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> You promised Bonnie that...<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> You need to get it back now.
- On the other side.<eos> It's right there.<eos> Fuck!<eos> We lost the signal.<eos> They lost the signal.<eos> Do you know how dumb it feels to wait for someone who doesn't come?<eos> My agent wanted to meet with me.<eos> They were going cuckoo with the bookings.<eos> And a text took too long to send?<eos> I thought I could make it, but that didn't happen.
Oh, fuck.<eos> - Hi, Honey.<eos> - Say we really did it.<eos> - Did what?<eos> - The child.<eos> Of course we did it.<eos> I don't know if they're going to be good parents for my child.<eos> It's not your child, Jeanette.<eos> - It's more mine than hers.<eos> - Yeah, okay, but we can't keep it.
We'll stay there tonight, and then we'll see from there.<eos> I haven't really gotten it back yet.<eos> - Where did you get that?<eos> - From Freddie.<eos> Why didn't you say anything?<eos> I've been working hard to get them back.<eos> Why do you think?<eos> You'd just gambled the money away.<eos> We need it now.<eos> - Do you mean we're going to keep it?
It's Linn.<eos> - Saga Norén, Malmo Police.<eos> - Holst slipped away from the guards.<eos> - Oh, for fuck's sake, man.<eos> - How could he do that?<eos> - He took a helicopter.<eos> - Why didn't they stop him?<eos> They had no reason to.<eos> He's not a suspect.<eos> If the transponder is on, Kastrup should be able to track it.
Excuse me, ma'am.<eos> Uh, you don't pay for that at the register.<eos> It's old-timey.<eos> You pay for it in the alley.<eos> Hmm. So, now that I'm going to prom, I was wondering if you could cover my shift.<eos> Oh, when did you get fired?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> I-I agree the slogans are corny, but you did sign the potato pledge.<eos> Looks like we're out of mustard.<eos> Well, I'll put it on the list.
I mean, there's no one else left to call!<eos> Come on!<eos> You can check into rehab any day.<eos> Okay. Okay, I am just about ready to close.<eos> We're pretty late, but there will still be plenty of time for dancing, so I'm just gonna go in the back and change into my dress so we can get out of here right at 9:00.<eos> Sounds like a plan.<eos> Thank you so much for this.<eos> And can I just say, I didn't think it was possible, but you look even better in clothes.<eos> Ah. Come on.<eos> If someone throws you a knife, you catch it by the handle.
Check it out !<eos> - You couldn't have made it any easier, you stupid bitch.<eos> - Fuckin' A!<eos> - The battery is dying !<eos> - What ?<eos> - The fuckin' battery is running out man !<eos> - Fuck !<eos> Where's the charger ?<eos> - I think we left it in the car.<eos> Hold on, I'll get it...
From now on, you're a salesman, a carnival barker, and that book is your bearded lady, your dog-faced boy, your conjoined twins.<eos> Okay, I get it!<eos> I gotta sell the book!<eos> No, forget about the book.<eos> You gotta sell yourself.<eos> Okay...<eos> Cut it out!<eos> You must brand yourself... like Stephen King, J.K. Rowling, that Chicken Soup for the Soul guy.<eos> Okay, I get it.<eos> Just stop throwing it.
What I would like is a room full of enthusiastic readers asking questions about my book, but... I'll settle for...<eos> yeah, tapas.<eos> Any other questions?<eos> That aren't about where we're going to eat?<eos> Well, you've been a fantastic audience.<eos> Let's keep this awkwardness going over at the signing table.<eos> Get over there and get a book signed.<eos> She looks ridiculous, sitting there all by herself.<eos> I don't want to buy another one.<eos> If she writes in it, I can't return it.
It's the first time I've taken care of business without visual aids.<eos> I get it.<eos> So how's it going with the sales?<eos> Oh, not so good.<eos> Molly's busting her ass but no one's buying.<eos> You know what she needs...<eos> an endorsement.<eos> Some celebrity blabbing about how much they like the book.<eos> Yo, that's a good idea.<eos> You know, you think about it, she's a Chicago schoolteacher, she writes a book, there's only one Chicago celebrity to promote it.
Look at us.<eos> So, uh, I was thinking around 7:00?<eos> Cool.<eos> And, uh, you deserve something special for a change.<eos> How about that place on Rush that you've been wanting to try?<eos> The one with the, uh, number sign instead of a name?<eos> - Hashtag?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I thought you said that place was too pretentious.<eos> Well, I should probably try it before I judge it, right?
Max, guess what Han's doing at the counter?<eos> Well, I know it's not towering over it.
Enough to know that things could go seriously wrong.<eos> My ex-partner, Bernard, was a Bulgarian mobster who used to move a lot of coke and meth.<eos> One of his suppliers was a member of the Triads.<eos> And they always took precautions.<eos> Packing a gun?<eos> That's expected.<eos> You get caught packing this thing...<eos> I'm dead.<eos> This thing's a ticking time bomb.<eos> I've gotta hide it somewhere where they'll never look.
How many contractors?<eos> Five or six?<eos> We were compiling bids for a renovation.<eos> That's when we found the asbestos.<eos> And when was that?<eos> February, last year.<eos> 'Kay, I'm gonna need the names of all the realtors and anyone that you've shown the property to, as well as all the contractors.<eos> First, asbestos, now a corpse.<eos> I won't be able to give this building away.<eos> I should tell my client to torch it for the insurance money.
- I think I killed it.<eos> - Give me the...<eos> Whoa. What have you done?<eos> Give me the knife.<eos> Elizabeth, give me the knife.<eos> Give...<eos> Give...<eos> Give me the knife.<eos> - No.<eos> - Give it, okay?
One of the most important values, according to Gandhi, is the right to say no and the duty to say no, what he called Sathiagray: passion and the power of truth.<eos> The British wanted us to stop producing salt, to have a monopoly.<eos> He said: "We will continue to produce for our survival.<eos> "Nature gives us, we will not obey."<eos> We follow the same logic saying:<eos> "We do not respect the patenting of seeds."<eos> We received these seeds Nature, through farmer selection of centuries.<eos> They can not be patented.<eos> We will continue to protect and share.<eos> Do you think it is better to repair the system or change it?
So it becomes extremism which is based more on "how to hate each other," and less on self-transformation.<eos> Spirituality is to understand your place in the universe, understand that you are connected with the rest of the universe, understand the nature of this connection and the responsibilities that go with it.<eos> The deep spirituality is a matter of freedom.<eos> When you know yourself, you know you do not depend Nestlé or Monsanto.<eos> You are shaped by the incredible force of creation of which you are a party.<eos> You feel part of it gives you strength and tremendous courage because the universe is home to an amazing creative energy.<eos> You take advantage of this universe and of Western science, while keeping it ? on spirituality.<eos> You have to find a balance between science and spirituality.<eos> Fun, you can find it at the market, but happiness, no.<eos> Happiness, you have to find it inside.
Don't get comfortable.<eos> You won't be here long.<eos> Don't be an ass, T.<eos> Does anyone want something?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I'll take a water, please.<eos> Sure thing.<eos> So our friend traced the laptop signal back to the FBI in New York, but he didn't have the skill to get past the firewall.<eos> Once the feds found my hack, they brought down the iron curtain.<eos> I haven't found a way to pierce it.

You just said you couldn't hack the FBI, so how are you gonna find this guy?<eos> Did your friend check to see if the laptop was the only computer accessing the web portal?<eos> - No.<eos> - If he's smart, he wouldn't bring it back to his house.
When are you going to chop the fireworks to grill the ducks!<eos> Ah, out of my way! Ah, you really can't work.<eos> You're right. 'The Child in the Basement' is based on Ri Jin's and my childhood.<eos> Then the two of you are not biological siblings.<eos> Didn't you say the boy was afraid of basements because of love?<eos> Ah, these guys are filming a melodrama all day.<eos> How can you just chop the firewood in half!<eos> This brat!<eos> You already know how to do it!<eos> You have to chop it in small pieces.
Not at all.<eos> It's alright.<eos> You rascal, seriously.<eos> Hey, you're supposed to receive what your dad gives you, you punk! Hurry take it!<eos> -That's right.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> You rascal, you end up enjoying it anyways...<eos> Hey, it's a new year, let's take a picture together. Go bring your selfie stick so my face can come out smaller.<eos> Don't you have one that's a meter long or something?<eos> - Bring it quickly. - Where's the selfie stick?
What about the bubble?<eos> There's no Donna in the bubble.<eos> Oh, come on, there's room for Donna in the bubble.<eos> You realize I get to sleep with whoever's in the bubble, right?<eos> So long as you realize that my dad's in the bubble.<eos> Donna it is.<eos> Come here.<eos> All right.<eos> Remember that thing online?<eos> We're doing it.
Now, where would be the perfect place to...<eos> Good morning, Louis.<eos> Holy shit. You just scared the shit out of me.<eos> What are you doing here so early?<eos> It's 8:15.<eos> Well, yeah, but we worked late last night, and I told you to take the morning.<eos> Louis, it's day two, I'm not taking anything.<eos> Oh, shoot.<eos> I get it.<eos> You came in early because you bought me an expensive gift and you wanted to surprise me by putting it on my desk.
The milder salsa's right here.<eos> Listen... oh!<eos> Do girls eat now?<eos> Wow! Lena Dunham changed everything!<eos> Listen, which one of you is sleeping with the model?<eos> I know one of you said you were, but I don't listen when you talk.<eos> [muffled] She is.<eos> This is a massive ad campaign, and I don't know how else to say this, but I need his penis to look bigger.<eos> It gets nervous when you shine a light on it.<eos> Sometimes I hear her coaxing it out of its crawl space with treats.
So, Tucker's in and can't get out.<eos> I would help him, but I'm very busy enjoying this breakfast.<eos> Hey, speaking of breakfast, hey, do we have any non... okay.<eos> You know what?<eos> If this is another takeout menu from the Chinese place, we will have words.<eos> It's a note.<eos> "Hear ye, hear ye, listen close,<eos> "in just one day, a birthday toast.<eos> "It's Bonnie Wheeler's special day,<eos> "so whoop it up, or you'll all pay.
You guys haven't done Jack for my birthday, have you?<eos> - Wha... mom, calm down!<eos> We're working on something...<eos> Big... and important...<eos> And surprisey.<eos> You are throwing me a surprise party?<eos> Oh my God, you are just the best son ever!<eos> Why can't you be more like your brother?<eos> You know what? Okay, I have to go practice my surprise face.<eos> Yeah, you know what? I gotta work on it. I'll work on it.
Terrible.<eos> Just awful.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> But if his n.D.E. Led to the discovery of those young girls,<eos> That's exactly the kind of evidence we're searching for, isn't it?<eos> If he had nothing to do with it.<eos> I mean, look, i-i agree.<eos> We're in interesting territory here, But mr. Mason has said he doesn't remember<eos> And he's going back to prison tomorrow. We've hit a wall.<eos> Then climb over it.
So...<eos> Admiral Hawley, huh?<eos> That man is a God around here.<eos> I met him when I was first got commissioned.<eos> Couldn't find the spit in my mouth to even say hello.<eos> You ever tried a rape case before, Virgil?<eos> No, Ma'am.<eos> This will be my first.<eos> I do appreciate a challenge, though.<eos> And if my superiors saw fit to assign me this case, well, they must believe I'm up to it.
Say something, yes.<eos> But this?<eos> Cut paragraphs two and three.<eos> The rest of it's not that bad.<eos> I've seen better writing on soap operas.<eos> I understand your reluctance to capitalize on a personal tragedy, but we've been losing points with women for weeks.<eos> And the lack of White House action on military rape, it's having an effect.<eos> I understand your position, sir.<eos> It's a military matter and deserves to be handled accordingly.<eos> But most women don't see it that way.

Olivia, listen to me.<eos> - Goodbye, dad.<eos> - Olivia.<eos> Olivia!<eos> Why are you working with Rowan?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Those bodies in the morgue.<eos> I know your work.<eos> I'd know it anywhere.
Emily Thorne no longer exists.<eos> It's the end of an era.<eos> My dad cut a deal with the feds.<eos> In exchange for not suing the government over his 20-year ordeal, they're not coming after me for fraud.<eos> I wish the same could be said for all of our take-downs.<eos> I've been tracking them, and one's been particularly busy, making calls to the rest of the Red Sharpie Society.<eos> Tom Kingsly.<eos> - The former senator?<eos> - Or as I like to call him, the corrupt prosecutor who convicted David, then rode a tide of public goodwill into that seat in congress.<eos> Until we pulled it out from under him.
If you or anybody else on that damn list makes a move against Amanda...<eos> Look over your shoulder, 'cause I will end you.<eos> You think you suffered at the hands of my daughter, you have no idea what I'm capable of.<eos> You hear me?<eos> So get on the phone and spread the word...<eos> Stay away from David and Amanda Clarke.<eos> - Victoria's reaching out?<eos> - I won't answer.<eos> That's called survival instinct.<eos> You should follow it.
She should have come after just me, and instead, she targeted the innocent.<eos> No, you're not hearing me.<eos> Oh, but I am hearing you, Margaux.<eos> Amanda Clarke is chaos theory, and I cannot let this continue.<eos> Victoria, it won't undo anything.<eos> Except her.<eos> Then I can't stand in your way, but I won't help you, either.<eos> Why call Tom Kingsly?<eos> What's her plan?<eos> Whatever it was, we shut it down.
We can use it to magnify the electrical charge.<eos> Stop looking confused!<eos> Look happy!<eos> Winning is all about looking happier than the other guy.<eos> Always walk briskly.<eos> Makes you a moving target.<eos> Oh, that's for Lofty.<eos> Lofty!<eos> And talk with confidence, even if you're terrified.<eos> Act as if you know their plan, and sometimes, if you're very lucky, they'll actually tell you it.
I'm on thin ice as it is.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> It will take me two minutes.<eos> Who am I gonna tell?<eos> Fine.<eos> Aisle 3.<eos> Ok.<eos> What was the name again?<eos> Sarah Williams.<eos> I don't see it here.
You and me, we go play nine holes.<eos> The ladies go and do some shopping over at Ala Moana Mall.<eos> Shopping?<eos> No sales...<eos> Lou.<eos> What?<eos> They are celebrating, their 20th wedding anniversary.<eos> I know.<eos> So?<eos> Baby, you don't think they want to spend it together?
- Yes.<eos> I never met anyone like you, Alex.<eos> There's more thumb than office in a lot of these.<eos> You try taking covert photos in the middle of a meeting with a paranoid spymaster.<eos> So from what you're describing, trying to go in at night would be riskier than going in during the day when the alarms are off.<eos> Sure, I only have to know in advance when the Rezident won't be in the building, find a way to get into his office without being seen, and then plant a bug.<eos> There has to be a time during the day where he leaves the office regularly.<eos> He takes his dog for a walk around the block a couple of times a day.<eos> Then there's your window.<eos> And for the bug, I can put it in a decanter stopper like this one here.

Three hours.<eos> The flight from Quebec to New York is two hours.<eos> He's already here.<eos> He's in the country.<eos> Alex, where are you going?<eos> Task force.<eos> They have to know the operative in charge of Black Dagger's here, and they need to know now.<eos> I'll pretend to find the file.<eos> We can't wait for the techs.<eos> You cannot be the one to discover it.
And after they are gone?<eos> After the death of a witch, the book finds its way to the Samhain.<eos> This ensures the survival of the discovery of witches so that the old ways are not lost.<eos> Some of these go back hundreds of years to some of the earliest Essex witches.<eos> In fact...<eos> I have your father's book.<eos> That's how I knew he was dead.<eos> The book appeared that morning.<eos> Now go home and inscribe your book.<eos> You may write with ink, but first you must sign it with blood.
A time to reap, a time to sow.<eos> The season of the witch.<eos> Now we will complete your initiation.<eos> Where is everyone?<eos> I spread word of another outbreak.<eos> All hide away, quaking with terror.<eos> Last night, I was behagged in my own home.<eos> My assailant used the water in this well to reach me, right here in the very heart of our domain.<eos> Last night, they had the element of surprise.<eos> Now we must take it from them.
No, for I promise you only this, Mary Sibley.<eos> I will never doubt your true worth.<eos> And as evidence of my pledge, in your house, I have left a token of my appreciation.<eos> Find them!<eos> This way.<eos> If I do nothing, I must burn as a witch or cede my body and soul to that horrible man.<eos> I know what I do is wrong, taking a good man's will, but what choice do I have?<eos> A black rose grow in his heart.<eos> Write my name and let it start.<eos> Wrap it round with walls of Thorn.
Would you like to have another not-so-dull evening?<eos> This is where you'd say something.<eos> Dinner.<eos> OK?<eos> Friday night?<eos> I'd love to.<eos> ♪♪♪<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Amber begs me to be partners with her on our history project.<eos> We're supposed to work on it tonight and she just bailed on me.
PS: I'm not your receptionist.<eos> Well, I should go give Paul a call.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> I'll see you around, Sam.<eos> I haven't heard from you in a while.<eos> I was getting worried.<eos> I tried to call last month.<eos> - My cell was stolen.<eos> I have a new number.<eos> I'll give it to you.
I know you think you're helping me...<eos> I am helping you.<eos> You'll see.<eos> - I don't see.<eos> You will.<eos> The door's open, Sam.<eos> Tea?<eos> - Scotch.<eos> Ooh, I have tea.<eos> - Well, I'll drink it and pretend it's scotch.
This is not about orange emergency vests.<eos> What is this about?<eos> - You being wrong and me being right.<eos> - Alright, ok, just go ahead, say it, get it over with.<eos> I told you so. 'I' told 'you' so!<eos> Yes you did.<eos> Alright, now that that's all settled do you mind if I go take care of the town?<eos> Oh, well, yes, of course.<eos> Meanwhile, I'm gonna write my speech.<eos> I think I should give it from atop a snowplow.
Well, that's enough tea and enough sympathy.<eos> You're late for Ryan.<eos> I called him, explained.<eos> I'm meeting him for a late dessert.<eos> Hmm... his parents?<eos> I'll meet them the next time they're in town.<eos> What?<eos> Well, speaking of Ryan and your shop...<eos> I made some phone calls and I found the corporation that bought your building.<eos> And I made an offer to buy it back.

Yes, and it also has six nuclear cruise missiles capable of destroying Juneau 55 miles down that channel!<eos> It could be awaiting orders!<eos> If they wanted to nuke us, they have ICBM's that could obliterate New York in 20 minutes.<eos> Why park a sub off of Alaska?<eos> Juneau would be gone in 30 seconds.<eos> And then the sub would disappear down the coast, to Seattle,<eos> L.A.<eos> How long before we can physically engage?<eos> You mean threaten it, sir?<eos> Capture it and report it?

L.A.<eos> How long before we can physically engage?<eos> You mean threaten it, sir?<eos> Capture it and report it?<eos> I mean destroy it.<eos> Sir, our closest surface vessel is the Navy minesweeper Kirkland.<eos> It can be at the site within 90 minutes.<eos> Tell the Russians they have two hours.<eos> Two hours for that sub to be gone.<eos> Or we take it out ourselves.
We should believe that Ostrov lost control of the Yalta because your husband knows religion, and he saw Ostrov ask Santa for a wish?<eos> Actually, the secretary's husband has shown he can be a pretty effective operative on occasion, as well as a religious scholar.<eos> Well, what if I trust your analysis?<eos> Say Ostrov is scared, that he's operating in the blind, like we all are here.<eos> Then what?<eos> Then we don't push him to the brink.<eos> Not until we know more.<eos> Every second we wait lets those battleships get closer.<eos> Or lets the sub fire another missile... or six of them, all of them nukes.<eos> And if we hit it with one of ours, it's got a 10K reactor on board.
These are all of them?<eos> All 20 survivors of the Yalta.<eos> A few hours ago.<eos> Being given a top-secret and strictly classified welcome aboard the USS Teddy Roosevelt.<eos> The Russians will be announcing that their remains have been buried at sea, so we'll leave it to them to make sure the story holds up.<eos> As you said, they are good at refuting reality.<eos> Ostrov accepted the deal?<eos> Yes, sir. They'll all get new lives and identities, here in the United States.<eos> The price for letting us rescue them.<eos> Unbelievable. In fairness, sir, we did get a chance to board that sub and take a good look at the new stealth technology before giving it back.
Walter? Yeah.<eos> I can tell that you're, uh, concerned about, uh, Cabe's, uh, departure, but I, uh...<eos> You know it wasn't him who made this team coalesce.<eos> It was you.<eos> I don't think I can be here anymore.<eos> Can you repeat that, please?<eos> Ralph... admires you, worships you... Uh-huh. ...copies everything you do, including putting himself in mortal danger.<eos> I-I don't think being here is safe.<eos> Drew was offered a coaching job in Maine.<eos> I'm going to recommend he take it.
Permission granted.<eos> Thank you, O'Connor.<eos> Your crew needs your permission to tell what time it is?<eos> It's a tradition, one of the many that keep a ship running safely and maintaining good order and discipline.<eos> You summoned me.<eos> I was hoping to get an update on your progress.<eos> Well, I have a new plan.<eos> I was able to isolate the mutation in Niels' lungs that make him so contagious.<eos> And I introduced it to my vaccine.<eos> I injected myself with it about an hour ago, and then I breathed on an infected mouse, the same way that Niels used to breath on people as a way to kill them.
Stop hiding behind civilians.<eos> You want to fight?<eos> Come out and fight.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You against me.<eos> Oh, it won't just be me, captain.<eos> You see, the number of your enemies is about to multiply.<eos> Someone's accessing the immune cellphone remotely.<eos> It's pairing with mine.<eos> Put it up on the screen.
So now the whole country thinks that we're the bad guys.<eos> Is there anyone you met at the hotel or elsewhere that might have been able to pull this off?<eos> No.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Find out how they boosted that signal and everything you can about this Valkyrie.<eos> I don't even know where to start.<eos> The mouse survived.<eos> We have a contagious cure.<eos> Are you certain?<eos> Everyone who's already vaccinated will just need a booster to carry it.
20 minutes ago, he made the same argument you just made.<eos> All our intelligence assessments are unanimous that Juliet is the last of the coup conspirators.<eos> There's strong evidence that she's still conspiring with opposition elements in Iran, which means she arguably poses a clear and present danger to American lives.<eos> We have a real shot at taking her out.<eos> We're going to take it.<eos> I know there could be blowback, but this is about national security.<eos> President Shiraz will be here to sign the nuclear treaty in two days.<eos> I'd like to put this behind us before I stand next to him in the East Room.<eos> In that case, you'll need me to pave the way with Algeria.<eos> You send in a drone without their blessing, they'll probably shoot it down.
Thanks.<eos> Let me think and I'll call you.<eos> Hello.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Is your father home?<eos> - Yes. Please come in.<eos> The company said that if we find something, we need to report it to the police.<eos> And the state gives us 30% of its value.<eos> No. If we go and we find anything, then we get in the car, drive to Bucharest, and sell the gold to gypsies.<eos> They'll melt it down, and nobody will know it used to be coins.
Yes.<eos> - So how did they carry it?<eos> - They didn't.<eos> It's still there.<eos> But I have no idea how they got in.<eos> The gate is closed.<eos> Can you move back?<eos> - I'll come for chainsaw later.<eos> - What for?<eos> I cut down that tree, and I need to chop it up.
Can you move back?<eos> - I'll come for chainsaw later.<eos> - What for?<eos> I cut down that tree, and I need to chop it up.<eos> The loony's here with someone from Bucharest.<eos> They've got a machine that beeps.<eos> They're after his grandfather's treasure.<eos> He's crazy.<eos> He won't stay long.<eos> - Can I take it tomorrow?
- I'm fine.<eos> - What are those?<eos> - Mercedes shares certificates.<eos> - Where's the treasure?<eos> - Here it is, son!<eos> But where are the crystals, rubies, gold, silver?<eos> - Let's go and brush your teeth.<eos> - Where are they?<eos> You keep treasure in the bank, not at home.<eos> - Can I see it too? - Yes.
- Come on!<eos> - What?<eos> - Come and see!<eos> - You brought it from the bank?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Come on!<eos> He found the treasure!<eos> He found the treasure!<eos> What treasure?<eos> - You want to see it?
Well, then I want that!<eos> I want the one with the superior technique!<eos> I've worked with subpar technicians, line cooks who couldn't put out a plate.<eos> I assure you, Dr. McMurdo knows all the techniques.<eos> - Okay, but I...<eos> - All right, everybody.<eos> Let's give them some room to work, okay?<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Have you finished prepping the phallus?<eos> - About. Okay, then I need you to get it to Jackson A.S.A.P. While everything is still viable.
! It was my sous-chef! Oh, god!<eos> [Groaning] Come back with that penis!<eos> Okay. Hold it right there.<eos> Okay, Rory. Hand it over.<eos> - No.<eos> - Don't be scared, all right?<eos> Give me the penis, and everything will be fine.<eos> Stop.<eos> Don't come any closer.<eos> Just put it in my hand...

Hand it over.<eos> - No.<eos> - Don't be scared, all right?<eos> Give me the penis, and everything will be fine.<eos> Stop.<eos> Don't come any closer.<eos> Just put it in my hand...<eos> I said stop.<eos> I swear to god, you come any closer, I'll flush it.

Okay, everything's gonna be okay.<eos> No one wants to hurt you.<eos> All you have to do is just give it to me, and everything will be fine.
As in "S Truman."<eos> They're about to drop the big one.<eos> I intercepted a phone call between Margaux and Victoria.<eos> They're using the evidence.<eos> The feds are on their way to Victoria's hotel.<eos> It's going down now.<eos> Margaux arranged for the FBI to question Victoria at the penthouse.<eos> It's a smart move on her part...<eos> No chance for us to intercept them, and she knows that we don't have enough time to pull off an "Emily's Eleven" and break into the suite.<eos> Victoria won't let the drive out of her sight long enough for us to take it, anyway.
So imagine my surprise when I caught your heartfelt performance, announcing to all the world that very same story...<eos> My story.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> Everything changed.<eos> Yes, everything but you.<eos> Which I suppose is just now starting to become apparent, standing there alone on the tarmac, realizing that while you hid behind your mission of revenge, everyone else around you evolved.<eos> Did you really think they'd wait forever, sacrificing everything and getting nothing in return?<eos> Did you honestly believe that you'd get your "happily ever after" after so many lies to so many different people...<eos> Until all you had left were enemies?<eos> Like the little pyromaniac that you are, you started a fire and convinced yourself that you could contain it.
Or if the body was pushed up against a rock wall inside a strong hydraulics system.<eos> Like a whirlpool?<eos> Exactly. Yeah.<eos> Meeting go okay?<eos> It's anonymous for a reason, okay, Aubrey?<eos> I just want to do my job.<eos> Where's the arm?<eos> We're not sure.<eos> But if it's still in there,<eos> Nautilus Jr.'s gonna find it.
Previously on "The Vampire Diaries"...<eos> The cure to vampirism.<eos> I knew you wanted it for Elena.
For the first time, I'm putting me first.<eos> Look.<eos> I'm all about girl power, but just give me the damn ascendant, and I promise you Kai will not get out.<eos> Oh. You promise me?<eos> Is that supposed to mean something?<eos> This isn't about Kai anymore.<eos> The people that that this would free are a million times stronger than him and us, and don't get me started on the fun they would have with a newly human Elena.<eos> My mom has the cure, Bonnie.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> If I don't bring her that, she's gonna destroy it.
Just please take my hand.<eos> Please, Caroline.<eos> I don't want your help, Stefan.<eos> I just want you to die.<eos> Your heart's racing again, Stefan.<eos> Let me fix that.<eos> Caroline, please stop.<eos> Needle and thread as requested.<eos> Do I want to know why you suddenly decided to take up sewing?<eos> Heh. Well, Caroline and I spent the entire day digging in the woods to find a Teddy bear, and now she wants to repair it.
It's just...<eos> It's just too complicated.<eos> We're gonna give it to somebody else.<eos> Bonnie's mom or Caroline.<eos> Already tried to pawn it off.<eos> Then I'm sure there's a long list of vampires who would give anything for a do-over.<eos> You're gonna take the cure, Elena.<eos> Well, I don't want it, Damon.<eos> I don't want to live without you either.<eos> You're gonna take the cure, Elena, and I'm gonna take it with you.
No. The night I turned you, my friends and I were captured by the Gemini coven.<eos> The ascendant is the only thing that can get my people back.<eos> If I was human, we wouldn't work.<eos> Exactly.<eos> The cure to vampirism.<eos> I left it out for you to find since Damon was never going to offer it to you.<eos> Why would you keep it a secret from me?<eos> I'm so in love with you and I don't want to lose you.<eos> I don't want to live without you either.<eos> You're gonna take the cure, Elena. And I'm gonna take it with you.
Yeah, or--or mini golf.<eos> I need ketchup.<eos> So are we gonna talk about it?<eos> - What?<eos> - Seriously?<eos> You're gonna make your best friend have to pry it out of you.<eos> I know about the cure, Elena.<eos> You do?<eos> How is it even possible?<eos> Damon called me last night, and he told me everything, including his insane plan to take it with you.
A man should be consistent, but take it from someone who you left to burn to death in order to save your own skin, no one changes that much, even under the magical influence of Elena Gilbert.<eos> Anyway, cheers, mate.<eos> So basically, Damon did the vampire version of a marriage proposal, and you just walked away.<eos> I said I would think about it.<eos> Why are we talking about me?<eos> This is your party.<eos> Trust me, I would much rather talk about that than the fact that I have yet to find a nonhideous wedding gown or that I can't ask my sister to be my maid of honor because she won't return my phone calls<eos> or the fact that I cannot stop eating literally, like, ever.<eos> So big decision.<eos> Go. I think you should take it.
I was looking for Damon.<eos> Word is that he took off to find Elena.<eos> Well, he's not picking up his cell phone right now, which means it's just you and me.<eos> Just you and me.<eos> Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it?<eos> Suppose we ought to get used to it.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> That's right.<eos> You haven't heard.<eos> Damon has the cure, and if we're to believe his bluster, he plans on taking it with elena.

Previously on "The Vampire Diaries"...<eos> The cure to vampirism.<eos> You're gonna take the cure, Elena, and I'm gonna take it with you.
Anyway, even though I got out, I kind of just want to make you suffer in new... and if I may say so myself...<eos> Totally inspired ways.<eos> What is this?<eos> Keep watching.<eos> What's happening to me?<eos> Oh. You didn't happen to pet a fuzzy, 4-legged, vampire-killing machine, did you?<eos> How do I fix it?<eos> Easy.<eos> There's a cure in New Orleans.<eos> I'll go get it for you.
I know I have hurt you.<eos> We have hurt each other.<eos> But there is something I've learned, and that is we must put this behind us.<eos> We are king and queen, chained together as surely as prisoners in a dungeon.<eos> And if we are not to suffer as prisoners do, we must make peace with each other.<eos> It's our only chance of survival in this life without going mad with grief.<eos> Do you think you could ever forgive me?<eos> Please, if you are angry, say something!<eos> Oh, you ask for forgiveness.<eos> How can I even consider it when Condé is still out there, most likely with agents of Elizabeth?
You're safe.<eos> I have orders to escort you to the ballroom, where women and children will be safe and under heavy guard.<eos> You might have saved my life by helping me reach the tunnels.<eos> - I protected you.<eos> It's my duty.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> For being difficult, for constantly poking about in your private life.<eos> You take your job seriously.<eos> You proved that today.<eos> I can take it seriously, too.
So what was your deal?<eos> Drugs?<eos> Booze?<eos> Sorry?<eos> Well, I just assumed if we're related, it must be one or the other or both.<eos> Well, I smoked a little pot, but it just always made me paranoid.<eos> And I never developed a taste for alcohol.<eos> It has a taste?<eos> Uh, Christy told me that you had a problem.<eos> But you seem to be dealing with it.
I mean Linus. "Iheartlinus."<eos> I never got a good look at who pushed her, someone in a peacoat and gloves.<eos> But Bentley recorded Joe Parks having an affair, and then blackmailed him.<eos> - He must have killed her.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But now we know not for what she stole, for what she saw.<eos> Well I think it's time for the L.A.P.D. to bring Joe Parks in.<eos> But his name is already Giorgio.<eos> Yeah I know, but what kind of name is Giorgio?<eos> What were you thinking of changing it to?
It's like what the Manson Family did in the '60s.<eos> Break into empty houses and film it just for the terror aspect.<eos> Except instead of the Hollywood Hills, it's all military houses.<eos> Latest one is from the Perkinses.<eos> Second tape, please.<eos> Malik's never bragged about this online.<eos> Never mentioned it.<eos> He hasn't released these.<eos> Yeah, well, he's stockpiling.<eos> Easier to get away with a crime when no one knows you're doing it.
No.<eos> Alaska?<eos> - _ - What the...?<eos> Put your hands up and move away from the computer.<eos> The other way.<eos> You can test my blood.<eos> I'm not infected.<eos> I don't have what you're looking for.<eos> Put it down.<eos> I said put it down!
It's okay, boy.<eos> You weren't honest with me about the egg, Mr. Rennie.<eos> The egg is not on Bird Island.<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait!<eos> I lied.<eos> It's at Town Hall.<eos> Christine's got it.<eos> You've lost your chance.<eos> Martin, take this animal into the next room and slaughter it.
This is what it's come to?<eos> We gonna gun each other down in the street?<eos> I'm guessing you're not a very good shot.<eos> But either way, you lose.<eos> Oh, yeah, how's that?<eos> You're too late.<eos> Dale and I are bonded now.<eos> If you kill me, the man you love will never forgive you.<eos> What do you know about love?<eos> Are you even capable of feeling it?
And by the way, it took me no time at all to find all your "hidden" files.<eos> There was a disturbing amount of hentai in there.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. I-It was there to hide my actual secret files.<eos> Sure.<eos> Seriously.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> The file labeled "Tentacles"<eos> has my password-cracking algorithm in it.<eos> Is there any way you could send it to me?<eos> I've been busting my ass trying to rewrite it from memory.
What about Sam?<eos> I went back to the bomb shelter.<eos> He wasn't there.<eos> I gave Sam a choice:<eos> He can either live among us, or... die with the Resistance.<eos> I thought the cocoon healed you.<eos> It did.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> The dome wall.<eos> I need to see it.
What do you want?<eos> I just want to see you.<eos> You have been right all along.<eos> There is something wrong with me.<eos> Eva's really messing with my head.<eos> Meet me out by the Soderquist farm.<eos> Just you and me.<eos> I'll be there in an hour.<eos> Your gun!<eos> Toss it in the woods.
I'll let Eva shower and then bring her to you.<eos> I'm sorry, Joe, I have no idea what this is.<eos> Christine never talked about building something that could bring down the dome?<eos> This can bring down the dome?<eos> I'm not sure yet, but if these lines are sound waves, see how they're all directed to this focal point where they're expanding?<eos> I would think that that focal point would have to be some sort of amplifier.<eos> Why would Christine need to amplify sound inside the dome?<eos> I was wondering that too.<eos> Until I realized that every single attempt to destroy the dome has come from the outside.<eos> So what if the only way to bring it down comes from the inside?
Christine says they're not to be disturbed.<eos> What about Julia?<eos> It's done.<eos> Where's the body?<eos> Buried at Shumway's cabin.<eos> The Resistance still out there?<eos> Unfortunately, but we have who we need...<eos> Joe.<eos> You don't know?<eos> Our survival depends on a device that can bring down the dome, and Christine needs Joe to build it, but he refuses to help.
I'm sorry.<eos> You've seen a lot of other stuff, too.<eos> Yeah, that file you sent me was everything Aktaion had on the dome from day one.<eos> Why'd you dump it?<eos> I thought maybe one day we'd need it.<eos> And the folder with the M.I.T. time-lock-level encryption?<eos> Who's gonna need that?<eos> What?<eos> An unnamed folder is buried in those files.<eos> Someone worked very hard to hide it.
We'll infuse the serum with Christine's DNA, which contains a pure form of the infection.<eos> - Once injected, the infection...<eos> - Sounds like voodoo.<eos> It's based on cutting-edge research.<eos> Two days ago, I infiltrated town hall and almost assassinated one of the kinship's highest ranking citizens.<eos> Let's just say I'm not one of their favorite people.<eos> Hard to believe.<eos> I go in there and get your sample from Christine, it's a big risk.<eos> I don't know if this so-called "cure" is worth it.<eos> - We can do it without you. - Yeah.
Everyone under this dome is innocent.<eos> Believe me, what I have to do, it... it breaks my heart.<eos> That couldn't have been my daughter.<eos> She's less than a day old.<eos> What'd you do to her?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> I think you're lying.<eos> If you really were human, you'd remember everything you did while you were infected.<eos> I do.<eos> I know there was a plan and I was following it,
Here.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> That did it.<eos> Ohh!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Uh, acute MI Cardiac tamponade.<eos> His ventricle ruptured.<eos> You need to plug the hole.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> I can't find it.
And you are completely out of line.<eos> Listen! Okay?<eos> This story?<eos> It's all about me.<eos> When I tell it, it's about me.<eos> It's not about you or you or the fact that you two are messed up 'cause you can't figure out how to date or hook up or whatever it is that you're doing that I just don't care about.<eos> Me.<eos> I am the protagonist.<eos> You don't interest me.<eos> This story is about love and I will find it, that he is out there, and that even if I crash a plane, he is out there.
So this is us, huh?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> You like that I'm a biker, right?<eos> Well, there's things about it that you're better off not knowing, okay?<eos> I feel like I don't know a thing about you.<eos> Like the night after kid died, who were you talking to on the phone?<eos> No answer? Okay.<eos> Well, how about this one?<eos> Why were snopping into schizo office at kid's funerals can't we just try to enjoy this dinner?<eos> Enjoy it on your own. Check!

But what I do know is that they were fighting over this radio station.<eos> The Apex Radio deal?<eos> Yeah, that's the one.<eos> Uh, Bunkie was, uh, trying to stop Lucious from purchasing it.<eos> And then, Bunkie comes up dead.<eos> And Lucious makes a deal for Apex the first week he gets out of prison.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ah, this isn't bad, Cookie.<eos> We'll start investigating the deal right away.<eos> At the very least, we'll tie it up for years.

I can't find them.<eos> Can't find them.<eos> I can't find them.<eos> I can't...<eos> I can't find them.<eos> I can't find them.<eos> Dwight, do you know what Mommy did with her bullets?<eos> Where you been, man?<eos> I'm dying trying to find one sound.<eos> - Let's hear it.
Sub-basement, east wing.<eos> Now, somewhere near the junction of those gathering lines<eos> North side of the hallway, second door from the end,<eos> In a chamber off of a small corridor. What are you gonna do?<eos> (Mark) disable the compressor.<eos> We knock that out, The pressure in the pipes drops.<eos> But Christoph overrode the compressor.<eos> You won't be able to turn it off, even manually.<eos> We're not gonna turn it off.<eos> We're gonna blow it up.

I don't know what got into me.<eos> We both know you'd never go through with it.<eos> Right, and why do we know that?<eos> Because you're not that kind of girl.<eos> Not that kind of girl.<eos> Wow, thanks, Amy.<eos> Coffee and slut-shaming is such a nice way to start the day.<eos> That's not what I'm doing.<eos> Look, the threesome happened, and it was fun.<eos> I'd do it again, actually.
Yeah, but this crime scene's total chaos.<eos> Look at this guy.<eos> More than just shot, he's been beaten to a pulp.<eos> The others weren't this bad.<eos> Well, he's escalating.<eos> He's either getting more angry or losing control.<eos> Or both.<eos> He might also be on drugs.<eos> This has gotta be her purse.<eos> I wonder if he was trying to snatch it.
Except this one...<eos> is a real diamond.<eos> Now, how could you possibly know that?<eos> Because generally, fake diamonds don't have serial numbers.<eos> You guys are gonna love this.<eos> Remember this mug?<eos> Radomir Ivanovich.<eos> Knocked over a jewelry store for a bunch of diamonds.<eos> And according to the serial number you found on that diamond, it was from that heist.<eos> It turns out that before he was killed, he actually stashed that loot somewhere, and HPD's been trying to recover it ever since.
Someone was blackmailing you.<eos> They said they wanted $5,000 or they would tell the police what I was doing.<eos> I knew that I would go back to jail, s-so I paid.<eos> Everything was quiet for a while.<eos> Then, a few days ago, I get a new text.<eos> A picture of that poor man, Barrow, with a bunch of instructions.<eos> They were telling me where he would be, when he would be there.<eos> That I had to use a cab.<eos> The cops who came to my house, they have my phone.<eos> Look at it, please.
For everything.<eos> Attention on deck!<eos> Sir.<eos> Am I interrupting?<eos> No, sir. I'm back on duty in five minutes.<eos> Very well.<eos> How ready are you to get your new version of the cure out into the world?<eos> As I mentioned before, as soon as we safely land in a highly populated area, anyone carrying the new, contagious version will be able to spread the cure via close contact...<eos> A handshake...<eos> Or a hug. If each of us carries the cure to even two people, who then pass it on to two more people, we'll start a chain reaction that even Ramsey won't be able to stop.
That's the problem with top-secret missions...<eos> They invite conspiracy theories.<eos> He's counting on that, sir... Mixing truth and lies and spreading it over his network to turn the American people against us.<eos> And he's got help.<eos> That's the same logo that appeared in the video of the New Orleans attack.<eos> Whoever's running Valkyrie knows what they're doing.<eos> They've gone beyond simple text messages from phone to phone.<eos> This is a vast network. The sub's running low on weaponry, and they've missed us twice.<eos> Now counting on civilians for help.<eos> So we get into the network, and we shut it down.
The big question: is there a connection between this mysterious flying woman...<eos> - More coffee.<eos> - ... and the Man of Steel?<eos> - Hey! - Sorry about that, sir.<eos> Can you believe it?<eos> A female hero.<eos> Nice for my daughter to have someone like that to look up to.<eos> Yeah, real nice.<eos> What happened with the plane, Vartox?<eos> You were ordered to bring it down.
- Can't promise her death won't be public.<eos> - And messy.<eos> - Human casualties are irrelevant.<eos> Good.<eos> And if she is Alura's Zar-El's daughter... then she will pay for her mother's debts.<eos> And so will her city.<eos> So, how is it? Huh?<eos> How does it fit?<eos> I'm not flying around saving people in this thing.<eos> I... I wouldn't even wear it to the beach.
- Where... where am I?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - My name is Hank Henshaw.<eos> And I believe you already know Agent Danvers.<eos> She doesn't need this.<eos> Welcome to the DEO, the Department of Extranormal Operations.<eos> The DEO monitors and protects Earth from extraterrestrial presence and or... invasion.<eos> That means you.<eos> Your ship.<eos> We keep it here as a reminder of the day you crashed on Earth.
Pretty good.<eos> Since last week.<eos> How are you?<eos> Good.<eos> Busy.<eos> You know how it is.<eos> That's an application for the disability support pension.<eos> You're gonna need some kind of income when you get discharged from here.<eos> Don't know...<eos> I'll help you fill it out.
Bring that up on there.<eos> What do you want?<eos> We've got Vinegar Tits.<eos> Open the door or we start fucking with her.<eos> Zoom it up.<eos> To whom am I speaking?<eos> Don't try that shit with me.<eos> The management unit is in lock down.<eos> I'm not able to open that door.<eos> You've got a phone, use it.
As you can see from his blog,<eos> Justin lost himself in conspiracies about government secrecy, spying, and cover-ups.<eos> He's here, and we are stitching into him, Linus, because his posts consistently came a bit too close to the truth, because nobody's been able to determine his sources, and because he ruffled the feathers<eos> of an alphabet soup of government agencies.<eos> Justin claimed to have thousands of classified documents locked up tight.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> Somewhere nobody could locate them.<eos> Well, he was trained to operate off the grid.<eos> The day before yesterday Justin wrote that he received classified documentation at 6:57 A.M. about another government program and conspiracy the public needs to know about.<eos> Here he promised to post it tonight.

- Keep pressure on that.<eos> - Yes, mother.<eos> That was on Justin's disk.<eos> I'm not sure I like your tone.<eos> The "you're the only person left who could have leaked the code" tone?<eos> Yeah, that one.<eos> So, did you leak the code?<eos> Linus, remember when we met?<eos> You were just 19, answered that ad in your school paper.<eos> The agency posed a math problem and whoever could solve it earned the right to apply to an elite government position.
Why'd you disappear, huh?<eos> Don't you want to play with the worms?<eos> Huh? Come on, the worms are our friends.<eos> This is Carla, and that's her ex-husband Roddy...<eos> I don't want to play with her--she sucks!<eos> Hey! Hey! Watch your mouth!<eos> [guys giggling]<eos> Okay?<eos> We don't use the S-word.<eos> Jeff lets me say it at Mom's house.
Where is that rewind button?<eos> I'm looking for the rewind button right now.<eos> (Anders) Okay, you see the rewind right now?<eos> You know, I thought I did, but it was just fabric.<eos> You find--okay, well, maybe--<eos> What the hell's going on with you guys?<eos> You want to see my junk?<eos> Is that it?<eos> Whoa, whoa, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> You want to see it?

The what?<eos> Yeah, i just looked up keith mcintire's house.<eos> County assessor says that he's got a structure out back<eos> Like from the cold war days. Legit bomb shelter. Wait a minute.<eos> There's one more thing.<eos> Hello?<eos> What--<eos> You got two seconds to tell me what's going on<eos> Or i'll put you on your ass!<eos> Open it. (olinsky) open it!
He's outside. Who sent you?<eos> !<eos> I'm a chicago police officer.<eos> My partner is with your son.<eos> Now, step away and put your hands over your head.<eos> I didn't tell anyone.<eos> (mcintire) i was broke, okay?<eos> A driver i know hooked me up with these guys, mexicans. I'd drive the trailer down to texas,<eos> They put me up in a hotel. They load the trailer the next day<eos> And i just drive it back up here. 2 million in heroin each time.
Great.<eos> I had A.L.A.T. track the dark asteroid's dust residual back to its origin.<eos> It was a Trojan in Jupiter's orbit.<eos> Well, why didn't it stay there?<eos> Perturbation.<eos> Competition between the sun's gravitational pull, and Jupiter's created enough orbital energy to fling it into space.<eos> Like a sling-shot?<eos> It's more like a cue ball.<eos> It's hitting every other asteroid in its path, causing these meteor storms with incredible debris velocity.<eos> It's why we're having so much trouble tracking it.
I may have an idea.<eos> Do you still have that piece of meteorite I gave you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Right over here.<eos> I need to get back into the chemistry lab.<eos> All right, flood all the data to your online contacts.<eos> Do you remember how to get there?<eos> I think so.<eos> What're we going to do?<eos> If we can't blow up that monster, maybe we can shrink it.
She is planning to use illegally obtained e-mails.<eos> Not just use... - Broadcast.<eos> Which is so far beyond the pale, I can't believe Hey.<eos> We're having this conversation.<eos> - I didn't hack her e-mails...<eos> I just received copies of them.<eos> A distinction without a difference.<eos> - Well, no. The Supreme Court has spoken to this.<eos> - Bartnicki v. Vopper.<eos> As long as we as we didn't steal the material, we have a First Amendment right to publish it.
You used me.<eos> What?<eos> - That wasn't a think tank exercise.<eos> You were trying to find a wedge issue against gay marriage.<eos> Of course I was.<eos> And I found it.<eos> And you helped me. - Great.<eos> So I was your liberal guinea pig.<eos> Why is that a bad thing?<eos> If you think that gay marriage can withstand all legal assaults, you should rejoice in any chanceto defend it.
- Nothing, I just...<eos> I see this stuff all the time.<eos> You know, it's the strongest-seeming people, the rock everyone leans on, but at home...<eos> No, she was strong.<eos> She did not take any shit.<eos> Except from her ex-boyfriend, right?<eos> No, he attacked her and she left.<eos> Yeah, the last time.<eos> But there are a ton of domestic abuse calls on her file.<eos> And again, I didn't know your friend, but, like I said, I see it all the time.
I, uh... I-I hate to ask...<eos> Apparently.<eos> (sighs) It's about Secretary Marsh's portrait.<eos> It's being removed to make room for James Madison's, but, uh, no one seems to...<eos> - Want it?<eos> - They don't.<eos> And we can't just...<eos> - Throw it away.<eos> - Yeah. Use your words, Blake.<eos> No. We can't throw it away because that's in violation of the 1912
You just seemed a little off these last couple of days.<eos> I know it wasn't the credit.<eos> You and Holmes don't care about that stuff, but... whatever it was...<eos> You know what? She just got excited.<eos> That's all.<eos> I don't think you should help her again.<eos> She is what she is.<eos> She wants what she wants.<eos> I love her... but I love this job, too.<eos> The people who do it.
Something tells me this won't be our last wild ride today.<eos> The machine wants us to break into Caleb's office and borrow a few things.<eos> Your employee ID got us through the front door, Ms. Groves.<eos> But accessing the company code will be a whole other matter.<eos> For a genius, my boss keeps his code locked behind a surprisingly last-gen security structure.<eos> The cameras are resisting loops, so I've had to disable them entirely.<eos> You sure that's such a good idea, Harry?<eos> If the machine can't see us, she can't help us.<eos> I found the code.<eos> Now I just need to download it.
Look what we have here.<eos> Phone hooked up to my mesh network.<eos> Detective Riley and company commandeered it for themselves.<eos> Clearly you owe me a big favor.<eos> We got a soldier down, south exit.<eos> No radio response.<eos> We gotta move out.<eos> That's quite a dilemma.<eos> You stay and be caught or leave empty-handed.<eos> Unlock it.
You are my creation.<eos> I can't let...<eos> I can't let you die.<eos> Power surging across the city.<eos> It's coming for the machine.<eos> Harold, no!<eos> Men have gazed at the stars for millennia and wondered whether there was a deity up there silently directing their fates.<eos> Today for the first time, they'll be right.<eos> And the world will be an undeniably better place.<eos> Pity you won't be there to see it.
If I see food, I eat it!<eos> Well, there's plenty of salady stuff, anyway.<eos> Oh, Angela, read this card that he got for me, it's a scream!<eos> You mind if I charge my phone for an hour, Ange?<eos> Running a bit low.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Down here, is it?<eos> Oh, no, no, just a minute.<eos> I'll put it in up here, Pat.<eos> "Forget about the past, you can't change it.

Well, it's funny, Nana.<eos> Can you just blow the bloody candles out? !<eos> Oh, hang on! I have to make my wish.<eos> Hey! Mum! It's Nana's cake!<eos> She took my wish!<eos> Pat, could you move the cake now, please?<eos> Ah, no, battery's ran out.<eos> I'll just nip and get the charger from the car.<eos> You don't mind, do you, Ange?<eos> No, you can plug it in next to your mobile.
Ooh, my favourite position.<eos> Your Katie's got a nice room, hasn't she?<eos> Yes, she picked it all out herself.<eos> She knows her own taste.<eos> She's got a better bedroom than me.<eos> That's ironical, isn't it?<eos> Who sang that?<eos> ♪ It's ironical... ♪ I don't know.<eos> She's got a lovely big bed.<eos> Maybe we could christen it one afternoon?
I don't know what they're talking about.<eos> Do you think Pat'll be all right?<eos> Yeah. He's got Carol to look after him.<eos> Yeah. They're a grand couple, aren't they?<eos> Nice of him to have booked that lad for me.<eos> He said he wasn't going to get me a present.<eos> Oh, that reminds me.<eos> I didn't read his card to you, did I?<eos> Listen to this.<eos> "Forget about the past, you can't change it.

Look at this.<eos> There's Martel, Armstrong.<eos> Who's the third guy?<eos> Your brother.<eos> This is about him, right?<eos> When I mentioned Danny's brother CJ, you reacted.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> I don't think I am.<eos> Okay.<eos> Feeling a little overwhelmed here. Put pressure on the intestine and pull it between your fingers.
Ordering you to stand down!<eos> Give me five minutes!<eos> Then the show is all yours!<eos> Damn it.<eos> Agent Pride has breached the building.<eos> All units, hold positions.<eos> Uh, not sure what your plan is since disabling the Internet is Hostage Protocol 101.<eos> You can't put those files online.<eos> Can when this thing accesses an offsite hot spot.<eos> Tether it to your computer, and you're in business.
Is that right?<eos> Okay. Then who is Pookie Noodlin?<eos> You know what, don't say that name out loud here.<eos> I cannot believe that after all of this time,<eos> I finally know my wife's real name.<eos> It's like something you name a pet.<eos> That you hate.<eos> Why didn't you ever get it... get it, you know, legally changed?<eos> My dad. He...<eos> It just meant something important to him, and he begged me to leave it un-until he...
Micah.<eos> I'm-I'm so sorry.<eos> Micah.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Micah.<eos> Micah.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Micah!<eos> We worked so hard for that money.<eos> He was just gonna give it away to some criminal.
What are you doing here?<eos> - Same old story.<eos> My scooter breakdowns more often than I can count.<eos> I'll check, I'm a professional.<eos> - Okay<eos> Ishu, it's got a serious issue.<eos> - Really?<eos> So now?<eos> - Do one thing Give me your address.<eos> I'll fix your scooter and enter your house to deliver it
I have loved you with all my head and didn't use my brains, like you did.<eos> Meera... after today don't ever show me your face again.<eos> I will kill you.<eos> "Goodbye. . "<eos> I am sorry.<eos> I've been unfair to you.<eos> Whereas to you...have only loved.<eos> The thing you had faith on...was love.<eos> But the only difference was that you realized it first.'<eos> And I have realized it now.
You don't know what that means.<eos> He helps the poor and needy, for he is the resurrection and he is the light.<eos> Everyone should kneel down and beg for his infinite grace.<eos> Hello.<eos> I...<eos> I brought you some sandwiches.<eos> That's really kind of you.<eos> Mary...<eos> I need you to not do the whole Son of God thing here.<eos> What if we do it outside?
- This card's been declined.<eos> - That's all I've got.<eos> Got a car?<eos> - I've got a minibus.<eos> - That'll do.<eos> - I owe you one.<eos> - One.<eos> You may kiss the bride.<eos> I forgot about the kiss.<eos> We'll just do it very professionally and close our eyes.
That's often the first sign of madness.<eos> To what do I owe this pleasant visit?<eos> The cardinals request your presence at an urgent meeting to discuss the implications of Operation Saviour.<eos> They would like a full status report on all your would-be Messiahs.<eos> Alright.<eos> Where were we?<eos> What?<eos> - I don't want to have to hide in closets.<eos> - I know.<eos> We both agreed that our work is too important to walk away from it.
I'm not leaving you with my brother.<eos> Just promise, please.<eos> If anything happens to me her bedtime's half seven.<eos> Except on Saturday.<eos> And she says she's not afraid of the dark, but she is, really, so... always leave her door a little open and a light on in the hall.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> And never leave her with a whole pack of sweets, cos she scoffs the lot and then pukes!<eos> What else?<eos> Oh, the bloody giraffe outfit. OK.<eos> She won't let you wash it.
- We have a future!<eos> Which is why I need to speak with her.<eos> - Haven't you hurt her enough?<eos> - Yes, I have.<eos> - That's why I'm here.<eos> - No. Sorry, Father.<eos> Please.<eos> Give her this.<eos> Tell her I'm done.<eos> And now that there's a future, I want to spend it with my wife.
In fact, some people used to go around saying, in New York, there was a Big Six, not just a Big Five, because Schultz was so important.<eos> Dutch Schultz is known as the Beer Baron of the Bronx.<eos> He muscles his way into the restaurant unions and Harlem's number rackets.<eos> His numbers operation alone brings in $20 million a year.<eos> Schultz is also a vicious gangster with a hair-trigger temper.<eos> Schultz has been building relationships with politicians for years by fixing their elections.<eos> Come on, boys, all right, let's go.<eos> Right to the front, come on.<eos> Schultz pays off voters and brings them to the polls... so they can vote for his candidates.<eos> There was no doubt that the American Mafia took advantage of all their connections with corrupt politicians, and when they saw the opportunity to make money, certainly taking it from the federal government, this is what we did.
Stand guard.<eos> Mmm.<eos> At least they got something right.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You realize this is stealing.<eos> If it makes you feel so bad, buy something.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Very clever, Betsy.<eos> A John Jay cipher, if I'm not mistaken.<eos> I'll be able to decode it.
- Amen.<eos> Do you feel God's love?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I know you do.<eos> Now I remember walking into this building when it was rat and roach infested.<eos> He's bluffing.<eos> He's trying to trick you into a confession.<eos> No... no, they are gonna find where I buried Shane, and it's not gonna take them long.<eos> And once they have that body, it's all over.<eos> So go move it.
Well, what the fuck should I be focusing on?<eos> Well, why don't you tell me, Pernell?<eos> Who are you really mad at?<eos> Julio.<eos> You have to bring him back.<eos> I think it starts with figuring out where to put all of the anger.<eos> Put the body where it belongs.<eos> The rest will fall into place.<eos> Where?<eos> Where do I put it?
Maybe. Yeah.<eos> Yeah, at least Saul knew who he was after.<eos> All you kept saying is, "They made him do it."<eos> Who the fuck is "they"?<eos> How the fuck am I supposed to find out who "they" is?<eos> How did you find Shane?<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Uh, hey, you want Shane's phone?<eos> No, get rid of it.<eos> And I mean fucking destroy it.
- Just tell me.<eos> I will as soon as you get in the goddamn car.<eos> Now...<eos> Please.<eos> We came here to buy PJ a fish for his birthday two years ago.<eos> You were furious with him for turning down a job at Brooks.<eos> You didn't want to buy him a birthday present, but I insisted.<eos> Can we please get in the car now?<eos> It was rare fish.<eos> PJ wanted it for a long time.

I don't want you here alone when KD's working.<eos> So, if you're gone the whole day, I just don't come in to work?<eos> At least not for now, while we're getting a feel for him.<eos> Paul, he's been coming here for six months.<eos> I think we know him by now.<eos> KD is a harmless, God-fearing man.<eos> He's a convict and an addict.<eos> You mean ex-convict, ex-addict?<eos> KD's damaged goods.<eos> You can feed a stray dog, but you don't take it home to your family.
No, that'll be all.<eos> Lawrence give you a name?<eos> An alias.<eos> I need your advice on how to deal with this.<eos> It's not enough to hit back.<eos> Gotta put your enemy in the ground.<eos> Whose name was on the account?<eos> It's yours, Link.<eos> Oh. Oh, man.<eos> You can take my title, but you can't hold onto it.
You okay back there?<eos> Huh? You want me to put that science CD in you like?<eos> Sweetheart, I know you're upset...<eos> It's not finished.<eos> What isn't, sweetheart?<eos> Walter and I need to finish it, but you won't let us.<eos> I'm gonna miss him.<eos> I know.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Don't leave it there too long.
What do you know of Targo?<eos> I was there.<eos> Oh, yeah, I remember you.<eos> Y-You chased me down.<eos> I wake up every morning and get a good look at that scar you gave me.<eos> You could have killed me, but you didn't.<eos> And you went on to slaughter an entire village.<eos> Trust me, Ahmad, I've had no problem pulling the trigger since then.<eos> So now you have a decision to make.<eos> You can slay the monster, or you can set it free to help you slay a bigger monster.
Tell me what I want to know.<eos> You can go to hell.<eos> You want to go together?<eos> They were lied to, tricked by General Scott into making a weapon.<eos> - Who's they?<eos> - Molly's parents... doctors.<eos> Thought they were making an antibiotic.<eos> Truth was, the CIA was using them to make an assassination drug.<eos> Her folks found out what was up and secretly made an antidote.<eos> They were gonna give it to the world. They were gonna keep everybody safe.
Have my car brought around.<eos> Sir.<eos> That rocket explodes over the mall, everyone downtown's infected.<eos> I need that launch site, Malcolm.<eos> Fireworks on the mall is a tall order.<eos> Four companies have the job.<eos> Prescott will be at Potomac Park.<eos> - I'll get there.<eos> - John, there may be an antidote.<eos> The Vice President is tracking it.
- We need to call the cops right now. - Oh, and tell them what?<eos> "Oh, guys, can you come pick up this dead girl that happens to be in our room?"<eos> They're gonna think we did it, or had something to do with it.<eos> - Room Service. - We have to answer it.<eos> No. No, no, no.<eos> He'll just leave it at the door. Dude, they have a key.<eos> If we don't answer, they're gonna let themselves in.<eos> Aloha, beautiful morning.<eos> I have that fresh coffee you ordered.<eos> - Great, I'll take it.
I have that fresh coffee you ordered.<eos> - Great, I'll take it.<eos> - I can set it up for you.<eos> No, no, I got it. It's not necessary. Thank you very much.<eos> Aloha, and shaka, bruddah.<eos> You got everything you need?<eos> Maybe you'd like a pastry with that? Come on.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> I can't think without my morning coffee, you know that.<eos> Well, pound it.
No, I can't do that.<eos> Then she's really gonna know something's wrong.<eos> Something is wrong.<eos> There's a dead chick floating in our freaking beer cooler.<eos> Yeah. Good boy.<eos> All right, all right, all right.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> - Got the concept, bruddah?<eos> - Yeah, I pitched you the concept.<eos> I know, but I refined it.
- where you continued to follow her.<eos> - Help me, please!<eos> Please, anyone, anyone!<eos> Please, please!<eos> Interesting story. Can't wait to see you prove it.<eos> Rebecca put up a bit of a struggle with you, didn't she? A bit of a fight?<eos> You see, the medical examiner, he's a buddy of mine, and...<eos> I happen to know that he found DNA underneath Rebecca's fingernails.<eos> And I'm pretty sure that it got there when she struggled with you.<eos> I'm no scientist, but I'm pretty sure I know what's gonna happen when they compare it to yours.
And if we find something?<eos> In the event there's an explosive device, the bomb squad will talk you through it.<eos> We need to find his luggage.<eos> - I'll go with you.<eos> I need you and Farrah upstairs keeping things calm.<eos> The passengers are starting to ask questions.<eos> What did you tell them?<eos> That a gentleman had too much to drink, but I'm not sure they believed me.<eos> I'll go.<eos> The faster we find it, the safer we'll be.
Jim, take her down below.<eos> Make sure she's secure.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just... when I told her Ford was dead, her reaction seemed so real.<eos> Dad, the gun and phone were in her purse.<eos> She's left-handed.<eos> I... no, I know, I know.<eos> Everything fits.<eos> But why buy a pre-paid phone online just to pick it up at the airport store minutes later?
I do, now, but...<eos> You still won't take me with you.<eos> You gad about while I trudge through the centuries, day by day, hour by hour.<eos> Do you ever think or care what happens after you've flown away?<eos> I live in the world you leave behind.<eos> Because you abandoned me to it.<eos> Why should I be responsible for you?<eos> You made me immortal!<eos> I saved your life.<eos> I didn't know that your heart would rust because I kept it beating.
Never mind about me.<eos> What are we going to do about them?<eos> We have to help them.<eos> They need you.<eos> They need us.<eos> - Welcome back!<eos> - Well?<eos> Do something then!<eos> Erm... Eyes of Hades, Afterlife, death opens up a gateway...<eos> - We need to close it.
- I'm flattered.<eos> - Well, you should be.<eos> You're an extraordinary woman, Ashildr.<eos> But... .. I think I'm going to have to keep an eye on you.<eos> No.<eos> - No?<eos> - Someone has to look out for the people you abandon.<eos> Who better than me?<eos> I'll be the patron saint of the Doctor's leftovers.<eos> While you're busy protecting this world, I'll get busy protecting it from you.
You were there a lot longer.<eos> So this may seem like a overly simplistic question but are you alright?<eos> I will be.<eos> Just remember to check in with yourself.<eos> 'You have an advantage over most people, 'cause you can' write about it, you can put it down on paper.<eos> I won't be doing that.<eos> Oh, no. No, I don't mean for public consumption.<eos> A journal, just for yourself...<eos> I just said, I don't wanna do that.<eos> 'I don't wanna own it, I don't wanna memorialize it.'
It's been very helpful.<eos> I'm helpin' buildin' the case against Andrew.<eos> How's that going?<eos> It's lookin' pretty strong.<eos> Pretty strong?<eos> 'What happened to "We're gonna get the son-of-a-bitch?"'<eos> The manifesto, the van, the electronics at the farm.<eos> I've been thinking about all that.<eos> Why hold onto the van?<eos> Why not ditch it?

- What do you mean?<eos> I don't want to discuss it now.<eos> I'm in a rush.<eos> We'll have a proper conversation later.<eos> I know it's cheating, but I think I might get a jar of horseradish.<eos> It really isn't bad now.<eos> - That's not like you. - True.<eos> We could use it in sandwiches without having to go through the palaver.<eos> - Can I borrow some soda, Mrs Patmore? - Borrow?<eos> So you'll give it back (? )
Peter, are you back on Squad already?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Total surprise, actually.<eos> Boden just sprung it on me.<eos> Come say hi to the guys.<eos> Actually, is there somewhere we can go for a little privacy?<eos> Sure.<eos> You could throw a stone and hit the water, it's that close.<eos> I'm telling you, a little revamp, and this place could be the beachfront hot spot.<eos> Okay, so then we renovate it and we sell it.

It's better than just a cash buyout.<eos> Mom, I know you don't want me to be a firefighter.<eos> This isn't about that, Peter.<eos> It's a chance for us to build something of our own again.<eos> You'd love Wilmington, the weather, the people.<eos> There's this guy, Doc... Doc?<eos> That's his name?<eos> I guess. That's what everyone calls him.<eos> He's sort of a character.<eos> Anyway, he totally knows the place, and he offered to help us start it up again.
I'll log you in.<eos> So she never said anything to you?<eos> No.<eos> But I knew something was upsetting her.<eos> - It's all yours.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Wait.<eos> I'm still confused.<eos> How could Dani's accident have been murder?<eos> Sebastian found a way to take over her car's on-board computer and control it remotely...
That patient you've been treating...<eos> Jane.<eos> She's your wife.<eos> She fell off a ladder three years ago.<eos> Doesn't know who I am.<eos> Well, I wonder if she would recognize who you are now.<eos> Now what?<eos> Okay, now every hot cell phone in the area will think this is a cell phone tower.<eos> We just need to wait for Kirsten's number to pop up.<eos> And then we need to find it.
My name is Fox Mulder.<eos> Since my childhood, I have been obsessed by a controversial global phenomenon.<eos> Since my sister disappeared when I was 12 years old... in what I believe was an alien abduction.<eos> My obsession took me to the FBI, where I investigated paranormal science cases through the auspices of a unit known as the X-Files.<eos> Through this unit, I could continue my work on the alien phenomenon, and the search for my missing sister.<eos> In 1993, the FBI sought to impugn my work, bringing in a scientist and medical doctor to debunk it... which only deepened my obsession for the better part of a decade, during which time that agent, Dana Scully,
Fair enough.<eos> I'm not gonna remove the bone from your chest.<eos> Why?<eos> I also got 5 milligrams of Midazolam if you need it.<eos> Would you like a sedative, Jim?<eos> I want this damn thing taken out.<eos> (Will) Believe it or not, you're fine for now.<eos> If I remove that from your chest, that's when you're gonna be in trouble.<eos> So I'm gonna cut down the bone so it doesn't move and damage your lung.<eos> And then we'll wrap it and secure it, and you're gonna keep calm until I can get you to an OR.
- Where are the documents?<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> No, no! Samira!<eos> Abu Omar. - I should have known it was you.<eos> - You know him?<eos> I want to help you liberate Abuddin from the apostate Al Fayeeds.<eos> I said there was to be no gas.<eos> Yesterday in Ma'an... a thousand people dead.<eos> The legal team representing the Al Fayeed trust is contesting the will.<eos> Okay, so how do I get it?
I'm depending on you.<eos> Keep an eye on your brother.<eos> I'm depending on you.<eos> You must be proud of your big brothers.<eos> You should be.<eos> They are going to be part of something very great.<eos> Something heroic.<eos> I'd bet you'd like to be a part of it, huh?<eos> I could teach you the craft of the knife.<eos> Would you like to hold it?
Maybe you smoked them while you were out sleepwalking.<eos> Where'd you go? I woke up in a drained pond.<eos> When I crawled out, there was a car parked up on top.<eos> A white Mercedes.<eos> It was empty.<eos> Then I saw another car coming.<eos> It was John, the neighbor.<eos> His son was with him.<eos> I think my phone is probably up there.<eos> They're gonna find it.
- Yeah, just a minute.<eos> I know you go out there to pray with him.<eos> Who?<eos> Don't make me say his name.<eos> Do you know what your father would do if he found out?<eos> Shoot him again?<eos> Michael, you can't go out there anymore.<eos> - He deserves forgiveness.<eos> - No, not him.<eos> Everyone who asks for it deserves it, Mom.
I want sit rep on my desk by the time I get back from Mexico.<eos> And don't give me any of your best guesses.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Odessa, huh?<eos> You must have saved up an awful lot of frequent-flyer miles to bring us here.<eos> 'Cause only Ukrainians drink Horilka?<eos> No one's made radio tubes like that since World War II.<eos> This is a Soviet bunker.<eos> We always loved our history.<eos> I just don't want you to repeat it.
When's it gonna end, John?<eos> You comfortable enough over there?<eos> All right, here's the deal.<eos> One time offer.<eos> You let me go right now...<eos> And what?<eos> You give me immunity?<eos> No, actually, I was gonna say when I kill you, I'll make it quick.<eos> Sorry about the taser, Malcolm.<eos> I take it you're still in good enough shape to handle it.
Yeah, but...<eos> You're going to deliberately initiate a catastrophic failure of the V.P. residence systems?<eos> You got an alternative?<eos> We'll be blind minimum of 10 minutes before the system comes back up, if the system comes back up.<eos> I mean, that means no alarms, no lights.<eos> The President's a sitting duck.<eos> I'll take care of the President.<eos> Come on.<eos> Well, first, we'll flood the server with requests.<eos> That'll slow it down.
Guess what he called it?<eos> Geryon.<eos> A device like that in Volker's hands would be absolutely catastrophic.<eos> He could not only crash power grids, he could access encrypted banking transactions and take down telecommunications worldwide.<eos> I'm in classified briefings on the Hill every day.<eos> How come I've never heard about this device?<eos> Okay, I get it.<eos> I'm the new kid on the Agent X block.<eos> Five days ago, I never knew this program existed.<eos> Now I'm running it.
Pamela thought you might.<eos> You've been a very... bad... boy, haven't you, Dante?<eos> Yes.<eos> You are going to be so punished.<eos> Guess again.<eos> The President is waiting for you, Mr. Speaker.<eos> There's so few people I can trust right now.<eos> - I hope you're one of them. - Of course, Natalie.<eos> You know that.<eos> It's just that I have to figure out how to run this country while there's a cabal out there trying to destroy it.
Hey, Bo. What are you doing, buddy?<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> You really think I'd leave town without saying goodbye?<eos> Where's Pamela?<eos> I had plans for the Geryon.<eos> Sorry to have wrecked those for you. So is Pamela.<eos> She'd be walking bogey if I had the device.<eos> You think I can get that for you? It'll be in Ops.<eos> Malcolm will be trying to clear any trace codes back to you and the program before handoff to D.A.R.P.A.<eos> You think he's just gonna give it to me?
You know, the Russian Federation wasn't really happy when Olga didn't come home with the Geryon.<eos> Put a price on your head?<eos> No thanks to you.<eos> I was trying to get it back.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were on a date with an American.<eos> When you left me in that Chechen hellhole, you showed no mercy.<eos> And you better give me the device. Now.<eos> Not an option.<eos> Not an option?<eos> You know how many freelancers are out there looking for it?
I don't know what that means, so I can't ask you to do this with me.<eos> Not a chance in hell I'm not going with you, so don't even start.<eos> I bet it won't start.<eos> Give me some.<eos> Michael, what have you done?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> It's the damn radiator.<eos> I can rig it.
That email from Odelle Ballard?<eos> You lied. It's a fake.<eos> Sure, okay, yeah, it was a fake.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Why are you afraid of me all of a sudden?<eos> What happened?<eos> I...<eos> I know who you are.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You didn't think I'd find it?
I have kids of my own.<eos> Let me put this simply, son.<eos> Sergeant Ballard died serving her country.<eos> Any reports to the contrary are false.<eos> There was an email she sent to you after she was reportedly killed.<eos> Sent to me?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> What if I were to tell you that we have a copy of this email?<eos> - I'd tell you it's a fake.<eos> - Well, we can verify it.
All right, so maybe I get you together with my buddy, and we ID this scumbag.<eos> Look, I told you, I'm not the bad guy here.<eos> I want to help.<eos> That'd be great.<eos> Anything more on Alex Baker?<eos> Yeah, it's huge.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I got my hands on a document.<eos> A transfer of 35 million U.S. from SOC to al-Qaeda in North Africa. Yeah.<eos> Those Special Ops must have found out about it.
No.<eos> But that's what happened.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm sure you believe that.<eos> Can you turn that up, please?<eos> Her family mourns with a grateful nation.<eos> Now back to you in the studio.<eos> No, I need...<eos> I need to use the computer.<eos> - No, no, you're not authorized.<eos> - Fine, then you use it.
Oh, we?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I remember you getting a phone call and walking out the door.<eos> Well, did... Did you at least try her cell?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why don't you?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Who am I speaking with?<eos> This is my daughter's phone.<eos> (man on phone) Well, tell your daughter to get her ass down here and get it.
Not to someone who deserves our loyalty as you do.<eos> - Please forgive me.<eos> - Of course.<eos> I can only say I was angry about something quite different.<eos> I allowed it to cloud my judgement.<eos> We've all done that, My Lady.<eos> Finally, I'd like you to have this coat.<eos> I... I'm not sure it was a good idea.<eos> Please. Or I'll feel I've spoiled the day, which is the very last thing I'd want to do.<eos> Furthermore, I want you to keep it.

Who is us?<eos> You came here with Gabriel?<eos> He promised me he won't harm you, Alex.<eos> Michael, you have no idea what he put me through in the aerie.<eos> Julian is the one you need to worry about.<eos> - Please come with me. - No.<eos> You want to help me?<eos> Just stay out of my way.<eos> Get that thing out of here.<eos> Where would I even hide it?
Vega will change, and I'm gonna make sure you live to see it.<eos> Always look for the highest perch.<eos> High places keep you safe, allow you to see what's coming.<eos> I wonder where my dad is right now.<eos> All he left me was a note.<eos> My own father disappeared.<eos> Did you leave you a note?<eos> In a way.<eos> A message.<eos> But I can't read it.
I want Vega on lockdown, the whole city on high alert, every guard armed and ready for when David comes for us.<eos> Nice try.<eos> Any last words?<eos> - Get in.<eos> - What?<eos> I built this city when you were in diapers.<eos> You want to bring it down, I'm the guy who knows how.<eos> Come on, Jasper.<eos> You got a gun.<eos> Keep it on me, but get in the damn truck.
Come on.<eos> Okay, old man.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Oh, straight to the top.<eos> What would Father say?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Let's bring him back and find out.<eos> The markings on Alex's body are Father's final message.<eos> If you harm him, they'll disappear forever.<eos> What good is a message if nobody can read it?
If Seneca was alive.<eos> Two words: hearts and minds.<eos> You get the love of the V1s, convince them to stand with you, you'll be bulletproof, but you have to become a leader.<eos> I can make you one.<eos> Call me your... campaign leader.<eos> You gotta be kidding me.<eos> Quit being so stubborn and listen.<eos> Yesterday you were just an angry kid with a gun.<eos> Today, I made you a rebel, but power has its price.<eos> I'm prepared to pay it.
I should get a new cell number, right?<eos> In case whoever Rebecca texted tries to find me.<eos> Why would they want to find you?<eos> So they can find out what happened to Rebecca.<eos> What do you mean "what happened to Rebecca"?<eos> We... we taped her up and held her hostage.<eos> - What's going on, Frank?<eos> - Nothing. Relax.<eos> I already got your number unlisted.<eos> You change it now, and the police ever learn Rebecca's M.I.A., it'll look suspicious you changed it the same time.
She cannot stay in the king's bed.<eos> - We are not touching her!<eos> We have no choice. She stays.<eos> And so do I.<eos> Wait, wait!<eos> No food or drink shall be consumed until its safety can be confirmed.<eos> Take it back.<eos> You believe Her Highness is poisoned?<eos> I believe many things.<eos> I believe this palace is a symbol of our king, of his power, of his country, and our enemies have stopped at nothing to destroy it.
You never understood politics or survival.<eos> The state is a person, and a person either asserts himself or is subjugated to the will of others.<eos> We stake our claim or we are ploughed into the field.<eos> It is one or the other. - You acted out of pride.<eos> I risked my life for your vanity to rescue your wife's dowry.<eos> I acted for France because I am France, because without me, this country will consume itself in noble squabbles!<eos> Music, dance, art, fashion, all of these things have the power to change a nation from within, to affect the hearts and minds of people, to bring them over to us.<eos> We could never invade the entire world, but the world can imagine us to be their centre, and one day, my brother, they will.<eos> The cost is justified a hundredfold!<eos> If I were to teach you a piece of music, if it were to strike you in your heart, and the sheets and the staves were burned, you might then play it from memory to a salon of a hundred.

- Is it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I hear it in your voice, your tone, how you speak to me.<eos> I'm working.<eos> You're screwing him.<eos> So he trusts me.<eos> Brings me closer to Yusuf Qasim.<eos> Something's changed.<eos> I'm not here to play mind games.<eos> If you have a deadline for Harrison, get someone else to do it.
We'll take out the blockade ourselves.<eos> We're not firing on American civilians... Under any circumstances.<eos> With all due respect, sir, those civilians fired on us...<eos> Drew first blood.<eos> Lieutenant, the president's right.<eos> Even if we use our non-lethals, the instant those civilian boats see us, they'll give our position to the sub.<eos> Then we head right into the ambush...<eos> Take our chances in a dogfight.<eos> No. There's another way.<eos> I can't kill my network, but I can flood it with disinformation.
Th-there was someone you liked.<eos> You hoped it would be okay.<eos> Didn't work out.<eos> Did you give me a bear?<eos> No. I didn't.<eos> Did anyone give me a toy bear?<eos> No. Sorry.<eos> No bear.<eos> There was a bear.<eos> I can see it.
I was in the car yesterday listening to KJR Radio, when suddenly, I'm hearing Will at the Seahawks screaming,<eos> "challenge it, you freaking jerk!"<eos> Yeah, I remember that, except he didn't say "jerk."<eos> Or "freaking."<eos> Hey, we have each other.<eos> That's how we remember Will.<eos> I just want him back.<eos> That hole inside you...<eos> That big, empty place that Will left when he died...<eos> That's never going away, and no one will ever fill it.
Jane was unconscious the entire time, right?<eos> I mean, how could she possibly have known anything?<eos> That's a cute cap.<eos> Do you always wear that during surgery?<eos> Why?<eos> Because I think you're lying to me.<eos> Leave me alone. I have work to do.<eos> - Something went wrong during that operation.<eos> - Nothing went wrong.<eos> So, if I check the inventory of epinephrine used that day and compare it to hospital records, there won't be any inconsistencies?
I would want the research to move forward.<eos> You're the most private person I know.<eos> You've hardly told anyone about your cancer.<eos> I didn't even know you had a sister.<eos> Does she know you're sick?<eos> Who I choose to tell about my health, or not tell, is not getting in the way of our research.<eos> So you do believe we all deserve to choose what's known about us.<eos> What about what we leave behind...<eos> And what we take to the grave?<eos> Ethan couldn't make that choice, so now you need to make it for him.
Donor is Adam Glenn.<eos> He was 34 years old.<eos> Suffered a major brain injury in a rock climbing accident.<eos> No cortical activity or brain stem function.<eos> Otherwise, perfect health.<eos> We have consent?<eos> He had a donor's card in his wallet.<eos> They've done an echo?<eos> His heart is in great shape.<eos> And my guy gets it, right?
♪ Happy birthday dear, Dad ♪<eos> ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪<eos> That was perfect.<eos> Just perfect, thank you guys.<eos> I love you, Daddy.<eos> We miss you.<eos> - I miss you too.<eos> - Did you get our present?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> That's why I'm wearing it.
Thank you for taking the time to listen to our concerns.<eos> No problem...<eos> That's why we're here.<eos> And thank you for listening to our concerns.<eos> No problem.<eos> Happy to accommodate.<eos> So you would like to renegotiate your exit package?<eos> Mm, no, not renegotiate; rescind.<eos> Ah. Meaning what?<eos> Meaning: since I am returning, it seems more sensible to just... void it.
Oh, by the way, I'm gonna need your parents' flight info.<eos> I want to arrange an airport pick-up.<eos> Oh, no need-- my, uh, mom and dad, they live here.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, I just assumed, uh...<eos> Well, usually, if they live close by, the mother of the bride is super hands-on with the wedding planning, and...<eos> Mine hasn't been.<eos> Her health isn't too good. Oh.<eos> You know, that's actually just been the hardest part of this whole process.<eos> Not having her involved.<eos> I just always assumed that, if and when there was a time to plan a wedding, that she would be there, doing it with me, every step of the way.
Sue: All you ever do is think of yourself!<eos> Axl: You already have like a gazillion pictures!<eos> Besides, high school doesn't even matter.<eos> Just wait till you get to college. That's what matters.<eos> You always say that!<eos> You said it when I was in elementary school, you're saying it when I'm in high school.<eos> Apparently, whatever stage of life I'm in is the one that doesn't really matter!<eos> Mom, Axl drove back to campus and didn't bring back the sombrero!<eos> What?<eos> Axl, why would you go all the way up there and not get it?
I'm not a monster.<eos> You can pay me back in installments.<eos> [Chuckles] I'm just kidding.<eos> Despite what mom says, I'm not that much of a jackass.<eos> She doesn't really think you're a jackass.<eos> She was just saying that to make me feel better about being relentless.<eos> Well, hey, you're not...<eos> W... [Chuckles] You've got a lot of good qualities.<eos> Oh, no. I know I was bugging you about the sombrero.<eos> Ugh. I should have brought it home, but I really did forget.
How does this sound? "Flying to Monaco for the weekend with Liam.<eos> Don't worry, using protection"?<eos> Oh.<eos> No matter what I tell my dad, he's gonna lose his mind.<eos> International Customs.<eos> We just need to inspect your cargo.<eos> Ooh. I wouldn't do that, if I were you.<eos> This, gentlemen, as clearly marked, is the Diplomatic Bag.<eos> As codified in Article 27 of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, this bag has diplomatic immunity from search or seizure.<eos> You can't touch it, you can't look inside it.

You have to talk to her.<eos> If you don't, she'll lash out and cause a scene.<eos> And when she does it reflects poorly on all of us.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> Len.<eos> Liam.<eos> She's just using you.<eos> Why don't you see that?<eos> All she cares about is her power.<eos> - Of course I see it.
- Oh!<eos> Okay.<eos> - Um, I'll get Laura, she'll fix it, right? - Right.<eos> I just called my husband to give him the good news.<eos> Oh, did you?<eos> What did he say?<eos> It went straight to voice-mail, I forgot his phone was off.<eos> - Bummer.<eos> - But I texted him a picture instead.<eos> As soon as he turns it on, he'll see me with the earrings.
You want someone taking that?<eos> I learned to code by copying other people's work, pulling it apart.<eos> So did you.<eos> Yeah, I've also had my work stolen.<eos> It's not pretty.<eos> We never would've met if you had copy protected "Parallax."<eos> Yeah, but we did meet.<eos> So, because we met, now I can copy protect our work without fear of us not meeting.<eos> Come on, we wrote this amazing game.<eos> I don't want anyone taking it from us.
All this time, I thought that you were a victim of your genius, some sidetracked prophet... and that I was your second chance.<eos> But you're not, are you, Joe?<eos> You're an accident.<eos> You're something that happens to people who deserve better.<eos> I'm not an accident.<eos> I deserve better.<eos> I deserve you.<eos> I just wish that you knew what this felt like.<eos> That you could just see your face when you say her name.<eos> Say it, Joe.
One he can control.<eos> Gabriel, I'm so sorry.<eos> Poppet.<eos> You did all you could do.<eos> You played your part.<eos> Not well enough.<eos> The loss of him, his life... Is a stain on my soul. I-I can't bear it.<eos> Father has a plan.<eos> We must trust in that, Gabriel.<eos> His plan is perfection, but they will pervert it.
What?<eos> He said happy April fools'...<eos> I heard him, jimbo!<eos> Uh, I'm just a little confused 'cause April fool's was weeks ago. Mcgee:<eos> That's when we thought of it, but took time to execute it.<eos> "we"?<eos> You were in on this, too, jimbo?<eos> I want my money back. Mm.<eos> It's already down my scrubs.<eos> You wouldn't want it now. Ready, tim?
It's okay.<eos> Let's go talk to her.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Come on, Brad.<eos> That's it.<eos> Doing good.<eos> Come on, almost there.<eos> That's good, Brad.<eos> Drop the bag.<eos> Just put it down.
He threw a bottle at her head after she broke up with him.<eos> Rap sheet?<eos> Assault and petty theft.<eos> Then there's this Romeo.<eos> Joe Seibel, truck driver.<eos> No direct threat, but he's got a rap sheet for assault and battery.<eos> Windi's mom also mentioned a college boyfriend.<eos> She thinks he's the reason she dropped out.<eos> She give you a name?<eos> Didn't know it.
Sorry.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, Brody, I've got something.<eos> Lasalle?<eos> Cops aren't loo... right place.<eos> I-I can't hear you.<eos> There's too much static.<eos> I'm at Windi's apart...<eos> You're where?<eos> You broke into Windi's apartment to search it?
Anyway, that's it.<eos> Put those daisy stickers down in your tub, otherwise they win.<eos> Okay, who else would like to share?<eos> I would.<eos> Hi, I'm Christy.<eos> I'm an alcoholic.<eos> OTHERS: Hi, Christy.<eos> I just want to say how grateful I am to this program, because without it, I would have murdered my mother.<eos> And, you know, people toss around the word "murder"<eos> all too easy these days... but I really mean it.
But unlike you, I don't vomit out the first words that pop into my drug-addled brain!<eos> Hey! Clean and sober six days.<eos> Mazel tov.<eos> I made the dean's list.<eos> And I hate you both.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> 20 years of therapy, and all it took was an hour and a half with you two to make me love my mother.<eos> He certainly has a lovely condo.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Shame we'll never see it again.
I'd hate to leave Brancaster and I'm very fond of Cousin Peter, even if he isn't a countryman.<eos> He hasn't a nasty bone in his body.<eos> What are we doing this evening?<eos> Have I got your evening, too?<eos> Come to my flat for a drink, I'll show it to you.<eos> Then we can go somewhere else.<eos> You choose. What a racy plan.<eos> Not as racy as all that, worse luck.<eos> But I'd like your opinion.<eos> And you shall have it.
Something you won't believe.<eos> Loo, I've been around the world, okay?<eos> Whatever it is, I'll understand.<eos> There is nothing about this I understand.<eos> It's a trans-universal gateway, a punched hole through a weak spot in our dimension.<eos> I created it to unlock the mysteries of the universe.<eos> But it could just as easily be harnessed for terrible destruction!<eos> That's why I shut it down and hid my journals which explain how to operate it.<eos> There's only one journal left.<eos> And you are the only person I can trust to take it.

- Well, listen to this.<eos> You want me to get rid of this book?<eos> - Fine, I'll get rid of it right now.<eos> - No!<eos> You don't understand.<eos> You said you wanted me to have it,<eos> - so I'll do what I want with it.<eos> - My research!<eos> Stanley, give it back!<eos> You want it back, you're gonna have to try harder than that.
You have to ask him again.<eos> You have to make him tell you.<eos> He looked at me and said that there was no such person as Charles DiLaurentis in our family.<eos> Ali, your father is lying to you!<eos> A didn't just pick that name out of the air.<eos> A is for Andrew.<eos> Then why put the name<eos> Charles DiLaurentis right in front of us?<eos> Hidden, but hidden just enough.<eos> Why did he want us to find it?
Wait, so before he was a Campbell maybe he was a DiLaurentis.<eos> You probably heard, my dad is trying to decide how many people he can sue at one time.<eos> It's the kinda challenge he enjoys.<eos> I wanted to talk to you about him.<eos> About your family.<eos> Our family.<eos> Well, I don't think I've ever heard you refer to it as our family.<eos> Well, things change.<eos> 'When we were down there in that place, we saw a name.'<eos> We found it or Andrew wanted us to find it.
I thought I was doing the right thing.<eos> We hoped Radley would help him.<eos> That in time, he'd get better.<eos> But instead he got worse.<eos> He's the person who set me up for Mona's murder.<eos> He kidnapped and tortured my friends.<eos> Charles couldn't have done that.<eos> How is your father so sure?<eos> Because Charles is dead.<eos> ♪ Got a secret can you keep it? ♪

And if my mom ever found out I got a tattoo, she'd harpoon me.<eos> So get a small one.<eos> In a place she'll never see.<eos> What does this one mean?<eos> That is the Japanese symbol for courage.<eos> 'It's got your name on it.'<eos> No, but it could.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Could you hold my phone?<eos> Where do you want it?
Hey, hold on.<eos> This... this is where we were the other day.<eos> Yeah, yeah. I'll check over there.<eos> You check back there.<eos> Well, at least you still look like Emily.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Well, we finished the project.<eos> So I came back to see my dad and thought I'd make a little detour.<eos> Hey, do, either of you want coffee?<eos> - Yeah. - I-I'll do it.
Your mom made me a key.<eos> - Of course, she did.<eos> - Hanna, knock it off.<eos> Knock what off?<eos> I'm not the one who just shows up at someone's door for no reason.<eos> I have a reason.<eos> Sara?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What happened?<eos> I will pay for the bike if-if they can't fix it.
What about Charles?<eos> He goes by Rhys.<eos> 'Don't sweat it, Ali.<eos> He'll forgive you.'<eos> If it were his brother on the suspect board he would have done the same thing.<eos> I gotta go to the bathroom.<eos> ♪ Got a secret ♪<eos> ♪ Can you keep it?<eos> ♪ ♪ Swear this one you'll save ♪<eos> ♪ Better lock it in your pocket ♪
- We could do that any day.<eos> - Yeah, you know what?<eos> You're right.<eos> It doesn't matter anyway.<eos> It's just a pity prom.<eos> What?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Why are you bringing an industrial strength laptop with you?<eos> Oh, um.. My dad wanted me to bring it.
Good luck with that.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Well, considering the only thing this lab is able to do about a biohazard is ring alarm bells, not great.<eos> We're just not equipped for this kind of emergency.<eos> We can work the problem if we knew Barmal's formula to her serum.<eos> Yeah, but her formula tanked. So what good would it do?<eos> We have something she didn't have.<eos> A quantum computer that's able to run more simultaneous equations than there are atoms in the universe.<eos> Maybe her antiviral serum failed because she couldn't run enough simulations.<eos> She was willing to test it on herself.
He's here.<eos> He got Barmal's serum from Turner.<eos> I'm accessing the elevator shaft now.<eos> - Oh, crap.<eos> - What?<eos> Our security system detected a breach at the lockdown in the elevator shaft.<eos> _<eos> The system isn't recognizing it's Fisher trying to save our asses.<eos> Damn it, we're locked out of the computer.<eos> Can't we just unplug it?
Your job is to hold on!<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> Teresa, where's my dog?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Third mother in two weeks to beg me to diagnose something that would render her son unfit for active service.<eos> She actually took out an envelope and placed her life savings on the desk by way of inducement.<eos> It's sheer desperation.<eos> The last thing you need in your condition is that kind of pressure.<eos> I think I can handle it, Erica.
- Same time next week?<eos> The shift doesn't end for another 15 minutes.<eos> My husband isn't well and he'll worry if I'm not home by quarter past.<eos> Well, um...<eos> I suppose that'll have to be enough for today.<eos> Oh, I didn't know you worked here, Mrs Simms.<eos> - She doesn't yet.<eos> No, I've er... I've just completed my first training session.<eos> Well... despite your age, you seem like a quick enough learner.<eos> Job's yours if you want it.
I can't stress enough the urgency of this matter.<eos> I don't think you have any real comprehension. Of the depth and breadth of your vulnerability.<eos> But, only the one who possesses the fulcrum. Could possibly fathom that.<eos> I don't think you have it.<eos> I don't think you ever did.<eos> The fulcrum, if you have it,<eos> If you can prove you have it, Do it now.<eos> Your life depends on it.<eos> I have the fulcrum.<eos> Tell me what it is and I'll tell you where to find it.
He's bad for anyone who comes in contact with him.<eos> He's bad for you.<eos> His world, this, right here... Unless you get out, this will devour you.<eos> It doesn't matter if he's bad.<eos> What matters is he has answers about me. And I'm staying until I get them.<eos> Maybe I could help you get those answers.<eos> I doubt that.<eos> Liz, I know a lot more about reddington than you think.<eos> The bullet nicked the right lung.<eos> I was able to re-inflate it with a chest tube, And will start him on a prophylactic antibiotic.
Your hunt for reddington.<eos> Miss jubal, tell me where he is.<eos> He's scared. Hurt. Had no place to go.<eos> I'm assuming because of reddington.<eos> If I tell you where he is, Do you promise to use that information. Only as a means to find reddington?<eos> You have my word.<eos> In bethesda, there is a small, second story flat.<eos> In the flat, you will find a desk.<eos> The middle drawer has a false front.<eos> Remove it and you will find a silver case along with a key.
Wright: That's not what I asked.<eos> I asked for the location of reddington.<eos> He's right to keep us out of the loop, reven.<eos> You know the protocol.<eos> If there's even the slightest suspicion of a leak, Information is need to know.<eos> I trust agent keen.<eos> After the harbormaster?<eos> I'm beginning to regret sweeping that under the rug.<eos> She kept this fulcrum secret, A blackmail file, on some nefarious group, And then she gave this file to reddington?<eos> I don't know that she gave it to him.
She won't.<eos> But if she looks for him, he'll find her.<eos> Photographer: Hello, agent keen.<eos> Why don't we go back inside and have a little chat?<eos> Tom: Don't take it.<eos> You take that money, and he'll have his hooks in you.<eos> Trust me, it's the last thing you want.<eos> I'm not a criminal.<eos> I've never even gotten a speeding ticket.<eos> Don't take it.
The only true currency accepted everywhere in the world.<eos> Oil.<eos> More than $100 million.<eos> That's enough to finance a war.<eos> One more question.<eos> Who's Anna?<eos> Nice Russian girl.<eos> Any update on the oil tanker?<eos> Yeah, it's not there.<eos> Weather satellite couldn't find it.
Any idea who they are?<eos> Remember Arkady's missing oil tanker?<eos> This is the crew.<eos> Well, part of it.<eos> So the tanker's been recovered.<eos> No, just the bodies.<eos> So there was either a mutiny on board, or someone outside took control of the ship.<eos> That tanker's carrying over $100 million in oil.<eos> Whoever stole it wants to convert it into cash.<eos> Or sail it into the harbor... and boom.
Hey... so why don't you tell us what it is that Berkeley told you?<eos> Berkeley said there was a backup GPS system on some ship.<eos> There's a laptop pinging its location.<eos> Where?<eos> His sister's house.<eos> If Arkady has that laptop, he knows where the tanker is.<eos> I'll call Callen and Sam.<eos> Oh, uh... good luck on the inside.<eos> Don't drop that soap!<eos> What if Elia didn't give up the laptop and Arkady couldn't find it before he had to bug off?
Doesn't explain Elia.<eos> We have footage placing you outside her house before she was murdered.<eos> Elia was alive when I got there, and when I left.<eos> Where's the laptop?<eos> Better yet, what's on it?<eos> You working with Ivan Karposev?<eos> I thought you guys were supposed to be smart.<eos> Then why don't you enlighten us?<eos> You want the tanker?<eos> Oh, you know where to find it.
Now, Hetty, I don't have I.D.'s on the shooters, but the three dead in front of the house were Karposev's bodyguards.<eos> Now, maybe the hit squad was a group of Karposev's men that turned on him, to take the stolen oil for themselves-- we're not sure.<eos> And where are Callen and Sam?<eos> There are westbound on Krasnaya Presnya near the zoo.<eos> They don't have a visual on Karposev or Anna.<eos> And, uh, Ms. Blye and Mr. Deeks?<eos> They're about two kilometers into the forest, still tracking the last hit squad shooter.<eos> The team's encrypted trackers are working, but I'm blind.<eos> The Kremlin's CCTV system is on lockdown.<eos> I can hack it, but...
Drop it!<eos> Anastasia Kolcheck, put the weapon down.<eos> Shut up!<eos> I'm a United States federal agent.<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> You first.<eos> I'm here to help you.<eos> Put it down.<eos> Do you want to die today?<eos> I said put it down.
What?<eos> !<eos> The... ceremony was here.<eos> To who?<eos> It was all part of a... an undercover assignment.<eos> And it meant nothing to you.<eos> Nothing.<eos> I know you asked Eric to look into information about your father.<eos> If there's any chance my father's alive then...<eos> But I told Mr. Beale not to look into it, because I wanted to do it.
You thought that he was going to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, but he just washed up on shore.<eos> So, now what?<eos> This was never about money, was it?<eos> You were always gonna set that nuke off, but you brokered the deal with Hadad so everybody would think he was behind it.<eos> It's always good to put a face to your enemy, right, Commander?<eos> Thanks to me,<eos> Hadad will be more famous than Bin Laden.<eos> This thing goes off, everybody in the world will know that you were behind it.<eos> You really think our government will blame this on an American?<eos> I've given them a scapegoat and they'll take it.
I don't see how Pasiphae could have taken the Oracle without the help of someone inside the court.<eos> What about the soldiers that escorted her to the sacred grove?<eos> Their loyalty is beyond question. I hand-picked them myself.<eos> Widen the search.<eos> Do whatever it takes to find her.<eos> You believe I am the one who betrayed the Oracle, don't you?<eos> There are rumours you disapprove of the marriage.<eos> Is this true?<eos> How can I approve when it would weaken the Queen's position?<eos> So you would do anything to stop it?
Perhaps you should take some time to consider it.<eos> My mind is set.<eos> Make the necessary preparations.<eos> Of course.<eos> You're out of bed?<eos> You were right. Pointless, me moping around feeling sorry for myself.<eos> What are you doing with the bread?<eos> This bread?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm taking it to give to the poor.
Tammy, stop it!<eos> Come on.<eos> Leave it alone.<eos> - This is private property! - Ooh. Ah.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Er, I didn't mean to bother anyone.<eos> Then leave... now.<eos> It's just I was looking for the old Roman temple.<eos> It's on some of the mediaeval maps and I...<eos> I can't find it.
Now get out!<eos> Morning.<eos> You look gorgeous.<eos> How is he?<eos> Well... for a kid who's just had a parasite inside him that tried to liquefy his internal organs, he's doing not half bad.<eos> But he's having some pretty dreadful night terrors.<eos> Aren't we all?<eos> Where are you going, anyway, so early?<eos> To get my file.<eos> You really think Bulstrode's gonna hand it over just like that?
Holy shit, that nerd's 'vorcin' you.<eos> Nice, Paul grew some balls.<eos> You got served, literally.<eos> All right, I'm gonna kick it under that tree and look at this popcorn catalogue real quick.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> - Where's Sam?<eos> - Who knows?<eos> One day he's promoting some new MMA fighter, the next he's opening up a bespoke tailoring shop downtown.<eos> Last week, he didn't even show up to the studio, so instead of letting that time go to waste, we cut our own shit to drop online.<eos> Well, you don't just drop it online. We'll build some word-of-mouth buzz,
I'm so mad that we never got a happy ending between Heathstead and Beatrix.<eos> You've not seen the holiday special?<eos> There's a holiday special?<eos> Yes, I own a copy.<eos> What happens?<eos> Do they kiss?<eos> - Well...<eos> - Don't say anything.<eos> Go get it.<eos> I have to watch it now.
She works for Mr Travis at the vicarage.<eos> Dad's a gardener at Skelton Park.<eos> But I never gave up on learning, do you see?<eos> I read as much as I could and I taught myself, and I hope to be able to teach you.<eos> Maybe give you the shortcut that I never had...<eos> Right.<eos> The Civil War.<eos> Let's start with the Divine Right of Kings.<eos> Did King Charles really believe that he had a Divine Right to rule?<eos> Or did he just choose to believe it because it suited him?
Yep. Nothing to be done about it now.<eos> Maybe we, uh, we could do a blessing right here.<eos> Is that possible?<eos> Well, do you have anything of Schnitzel's I could bless?<eos> Maybe a hair from his bed?<eos> Oh, gee, I-- I don't know.<eos> I haven't had the heart to get near it since he... he was... taken from me.<eos> Any luck?<eos> Found one!<eos> [WhiterShadeof Pale plays] May I hold it?
You come in... You come in here, I will stab you up, man!<eos> Stop threatening me and open the door.<eos> I'm serious!<eos> you'll need a full blown military operation, man...<eos> Listen, if you don't...<eos> Nathan?<eos> Do you remember me?<eos> Look, I want you to come to the door, and let us in... .. but first, can you put that knife down for me?<eos> Go on.<eos> Just put it down and don't touch it, please.
But Joseph got scared that something awful was gonna happen and so he tried to back out.<eos> Which is why the shooter showed up last night, to threaten Joseph, to make sure he stuck with the deadline.<eos> Yeah. Where is Joseph now?<eos> I swear to you, I don't know.<eos> He left me a message saying that he's in a safe place, and that he's got to finish what he started.<eos> But no matter how many times I text or call he doesn't answer.<eos> I need your phone.<eos> The officer took it from me when they brought me in.<eos> I didn't get it back.<eos> I'll track it down.
I asked you for my lawyer 20 minutes ago.<eos> Super sorry, but I couldn't find his contact info.<eos> Do you happen to have his number?<eos> - It's in my phone.<eos> - Great.<eos> Can I have it?<eos> No, because you took it away from me.<eos> - Geez. - Duh.<eos> - My badness.<eos> - Give it to me and I'll get the damn number.
The US is the most sensitive country by miles.<eos> No penises, no vaginas, no nipples.<eos> So that scene you've got animated of Carl having sex with Denise, that will get us an instant adults-only label here and needs removing.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> We don't all live in a virtual Utah.<eos> I know, I wish we could include that stuff, but it's not feasible.<eos> What's wrong with this country?<eos> I can walk down the road and get an Uzi if I want to, they're sending kids off to kill people in Iraq and heaven for-fucking-bid anyone sees a woman's nipple!<eos> That's America.<eos> The Jack Thompsons of this world won't have it.
I don't care what he thinks.<eos> I'm not going to bend to this.<eos> Sex is a perfectly acceptable thing to have in a piece of adult entertainment and we are not pushing boundaries without it.<eos> Maybe we should just be an AO game.<eos> We're a game for adults - fine, let's just be that.<eos> That would be retail suicide.<eos> I'm not having the content of my game dictated to me by a bunch of moronic shopkeepers!<eos> Don Simpson wouldn't settle for it, would he?<eos> What would he do?<eos> He'd hire an aircraft carrier, fill it with prostitutes, take 15 different types of class-A drugs and then, I think, he'd accept the power of the marketplace.
and started running around the house.<eos> To be honest, I didn't think your technique was where it needed to be for the performance track.<eos> But I did hear something in that piece you wrote, something really special.<eos> This is a wonderful program.<eos> I hope you'll give it a chance.<eos> I couldn't help but notice that you didn't mention that the truck had been stolen till the day after the accident.<eos> Why was that exactly?<eos> I already told the cops all this.<eos> Well, you didn't tell these cops.<eos> I used to park it behind the garage 'cause it didn't have the tags
Of course I do.<eos> You'd better leave the lights off.<eos> Right. Smart.<eos> Please don't, like, mess with anything.<eos> I won't, I promise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I should...<eos> I should thank you.<eos> It probably sounds dumb, but I have to write this paper for my independent study and I had no idea what to do.<eos> But now I think I'm gonna do it on what happens to kids when they're separated in the system,
God, I'm so hungry.<eos> Kirsten, have you given any thought to my proposal?<eos> Another software emergency?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We're... on a deadline.<eos> - Can you save it? - No.<eos> But more for me.<eos> So when do I get to play this big secret game you're designing?<eos> Someday.<eos> They're just really strict about keeping it under wraps.
We all have natural intuition.<eos> People like me and Vanessa just have more of it.<eos> So the "darkness" she spoke about, was she specific?<eos> Our visions, premonitions, however you want to call it, they're not always literal.<eos> Like a fire for instance, it could represent...<eos> Anger, tension.<eos> You're struggling with a decision.<eos> You need to know yourself before you can share your life with anyone.<eos> You have a very sensitive heart.<eos> You need to protect it.
- Cheers.<eos> - To you.<eos> Oh, yes...<eos> How did it go with Morange's lawyer?<eos> I've been asked to take you off the case.<eos> From high up.<eos> Everyone thinks you're harassing him and even if he is guilty, your presence is destabilising.<eos> I'm a cop, I'm only interested in arresting the murderer, be it the Moranges or anyone else.<eos> Why do you hate them so much?<eos> I like my job and do it well, don't push me out.
Look, Ben...<eos> I'm sorry you got stuck with this gig.<eos> I didn't get stuck with it.<eos> I told Detective Yamada that I'm familiar with the house and the property.<eos> So you volunteered to be the person to keep me locked up.<eos> Wow.<eos> We've really come a long way in the past few weeks.<eos> It's nothing personal, Emily.<eos> I know you better than anyone on the force, and so I know that right now, you are already pondering a way to get out of that thing.<eos> I volunteered so that I could be the one to tell you don't do it, that you will get caught.
Yes, that seems appropriate.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Apologies, Henri.<eos> The grand prix of news cycles.<eos> So you were saying?<eos> A wreath necklace with 122 marquise diamonds.<eos> You were looking for something elegant but understated?<eos> For the funeral of a dear friend.<eos> It's perfect.<eos> I'll take it.
Your sister owes you her life.<eos> But she can never know how.<eos> Or rather, who.<eos> As you wish.<eos> But it's extraordinary that they were a match.<eos> Amanda's heart was damaged beyond repair.<eos> If you hadn't volunteered Victoria's for transplant...<eos> It's what Mother would've wanted.<eos> - You had that dream again. - Ohh.<eos> I just can't get it out of my head.
Nothing.<eos> What did you get him?<eos> I... I, um...<eos> I got him a... oh no, no... oh no...<eos> Ha ha, almost got me.<eos> It's a surprise.<eos> Guys, you didn't have to get me anything.<eos> Good, because she obviously didn't.<eos> Yes I did.<eos> In fact, my gift is so amazing, and personal, and indescribable, I'm going to stop describing it.
Yeah. You know, he had success and he had failure.<eos> I mean that's the same thing you just said, but I see where you're going.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You got me this turtleneck to remind me that even though<eos> Steve Jobs had some occasional disappointments, he went on to take over the entire world of technology.<eos> And maybe I will too.<eos> Yeah. It's like you read my card.<eos> So was I right about the gift?<eos> Yes!<eos> And I gave it to him at the perfect time.
Mm! Looks like someone loves the gift Gabi got them.<eos> Unlike my bobblehead, which I didn't see in your office.<eos> Oh, well... um, yeah... ah... that's 'cause I moved it.<eos> You know, I was scared that you didn't like it.<eos> My ex Coleman once threw out a gift that I gave him and I... I was crushed.<eos> I remember it to this day.<eos> I'd never throw your gift away.<eos> Good.<eos> So, where is it?<eos> Um... I had a messenger pick it up and they took it to my corporate office downtown so all the people there could see it.
Oh my God, that was so close.<eos> Okay, let's hurry.<eos> Let's get to Lilly's.<eos> Where's the shirt?<eos> Okay, I'm just going to say this one more time.<eos> This is the dumbest thing you've ever done.<eos> Okay, who's dumber?<eos> The dummy?<eos> Or the dummy that threw the shirt to the dummy?<eos> Okay. Let's just get it and get out of here.
Just give us the shirt.<eos> I would, except no.<eos> Something smells funny, and it's not just the wood shavings from that hamster cage that's filling my loafer.<eos> Why would two girls crawl through filth for an ugly polyblend shirt?<eos> Exactly.<eos> It's just a worthless shirt.<eos> Oh, so then you won't mind if I use this shirt to wipe up this unidentified sludge that you better hope to God is Greek yogurt.<eos> Elliot, it doesn't matter why we want the shirt.<eos> Okay?<eos> Just give it to us!
What?<eos> So... you're not mad?<eos> Well, I'm not thrilled, but I understand what it's like to be friends with women.<eos> I'm sure they talk trash about you behind your back.<eos> They most certainly do not!<eos> I guarantee you that as soon as you leave the room, they tear you to shreds.<eos> That's not true.<eos> If it was, I would've figured it out.<eos> Just like I figured out who was stealing my lunch at work.<eos> Next time there's a sandwich in the fridge with somebody's name on it, don't eat it, scumbag!
Well, then we're agreed that a drug-free Wentworth is better for the women than the opposite.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The drug program's reinstated and the recidivist programs reinstated as well.<eos> They're good, good ideas. So, let's talk about the drug supply.<eos> Lag on Franky?<eos> That's what she wants.<eos> I'm gonna do it.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Why, because I had an agreement with Franky?<eos> If I did break it, how many women do you reckon'll fall in behind her?
Are you all right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I think so.<eos> I have done a terrible thing, Hercules.<eos> I know that.<eos> But I will earn your love again.<eos> ~ I will.<eos> ~ You already have that.<eos> You always have.<eos> I don't deserve it.
Something tells me I shouldn't be flattered.<eos> I've not been tracking your business triumphs.<eos> I've been following your other stories.<eos> Those persistent rumors surrounding your proclivities.<eos> That you like young women who can't fight back.<eos> Women that you hand-pick from nightclubs and drug dens, who do what you want in exchange for a fix, you know.<eos> Women who, on one or two occasions, have just... never been seen again.<eos> Then you must also know that those rumors have never been proven.<eos> There's a conspicuous lack of security cameras in your building.<eos> I'm assuming it's because the owner-- you-- wants it that way.
I can feel it.<eos> I'm not dead.<eos> - You're not dead.<eos> - I'm not dead, mommy!<eos> She's okay? !<eos> Okay, she's fine.<eos> Do you have a cellphone in there?<eos> I need to call for help.<eos> Uh, uh, yeah.<eos> I see it.
Seriously?<eos> No running ever.<eos> That we'll take care of each other even when we're old and smelly.<eos> Tumor is here.<eos> Now you've completely lost your mind.<eos> You're like coming up for fresh air.<eos> It's you.<eos> It's always been you.<eos> They offered me the job again.<eos> Take it.
Mine's mostly hooch.<eos> It's basically a bourbon milkshake.<eos> Cheers to that.<eos> Karev, that is definitely the saddest tree I've ever seen.<eos> - Tell Robbins.<eos> - No, uh, it's better than no tree.<eos> Alex was like, "why bother?"<eos> And I said, "you have to have a tree at Christmas."<eos> Otherwise, your soul is just curdled and you've given up on joy, so I got a tree.<eos> I started decorating it, and then some woman went into labor, so I gave up.
When I was a kid, I had a train with blue streaks.<eos> Coolest toy I ever had.<eos> (ALL CHUCKLING)<eos> I know a train that magnetically levitates is inherently cool, but still, the color's kinda bumming me out.<eos> Let's paint blue streaks.<eos> And while we're at it, it needs to go 500 kilometers an hour.<eos> We've been working for three years, you know, to push it to 450.<eos> The test is in six days.<eos> Then it probably occurred to you over the last 36 months that if you used hafnium instead of a tungsten alloy in the vacuum tubes, you could decrease the weight of each car by 30 kilos... (INHALES SHARPLY)<eos> ...and get it to 500.
Tsk.<eos> Breeze.<eos> Are we dancing?<eos> CAT:<eos> Look at you.<eos> All dressed up in your big boy suit.<eos> Like James Bond making a living playing with toy trains.<eos> MAXWELL: (CHUCKLES) So tell me.<eos> How did you manage to get an exclusive with Supergirl?<eos> Girl knows power when she sees it.
Cos we can discuss it over as many beers as it takes, if that helps.<eos> Yeah, good plan.<eos> What the hell am I talking about?<eos> Those symbols...they're the same ones that Maori drew on the beach - it is part of Aumea's tattoo.<eos> You know, the imaginary one she's getting done next week.<eos> OK, that's it - no more tavi shit, ever. Deal?<eos> Deal.<eos> We like tourists.<eos> They have money.<eos> They're not going to come here and spend it if you abuse them.
Oh, he was stabbed in the chest.<eos> It looks like Duke's work, all right.<eos> Poor Victor.<eos> He didn't stand a chance.<eos> Anyway, I gotta go.<eos> Intern's watching baby Aaron, and she keeps giving him apple juice.<eos> You think Croatoan's tough, try an infant on a sugar high.<eos> Vickie.<eos> Vickie still has her sketching trouble.<eos> So maybe if she can draw the Aether core, she can put it back together.
Croatoan used a very special trouble to bring her back.<eos> He must really like you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why did he send you here, Duke?<eos> What does Croatoan want?<eos> The controller crystal.<eos> What makes him think I have it?<eos> He knows that you have it.<eos> The crystal isn't here.<eos> Then go and get it.
He must really like you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why did he send you here, Duke?<eos> What does Croatoan want?<eos> The controller crystal.<eos> What makes him think I have it?<eos> He knows that you have it.<eos> The crystal isn't here.<eos> Then go and get it.<eos> Deliver it to Croatoan, and he will let you keep Lizzie.
Thank you, Lizzie.<eos> How's it going, Vickie?<eos> - Almost there.<eos> - Hurry.<eos> Laverne may have been able to move this wall to hide us, but Duke won't be fooled for long.<eos> Or fooled at all.<eos> Duke knows this place like the back of his hand, poor kid.<eos> Finished.<eos> Good.<eos> So if you fold it, the core should be able to fuse together, right?
I need to speak to Boomer.<eos> What for?<eos> Do you want to take a chair?<eos> Nuh.<eos> Come on.<eos> Where's my cash?<eos> The rest of my money, where is it?<eos> Oh, I... I spent it.<eos> Don't bullshit me.<eos> I asked you to hide it, so where is it?
So you lost one student.<eos> You still have other kids and freshmen coming in next semester.<eos> _<eos> _ _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> John and I would like to cover the donation.<eos> _<eos> Our daughter loves this program, we love this program, and we need you running it.
What? Well, something about that outfit that isn't working.<eos> Spin.<eos> Yeah, I hate to say this; it's the necklace.<eos> Yeah, it's too much.<eos> It clashes with all the a-Dora-bleness.<eos> Really?<eos> I mean, that's what I think.<eos> But what do my people know about fashion?<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> I'm gonna wear it anyway, 'cause I...
We're talking weeks, not months.<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> I'll put you on my prayer list.<eos> Oh, she likes your necklace.<eos> Yeah, it's very pretty, isn't it?<eos> Oh, you...<eos> You want it? Oh, Stephanie, it doesn't belong to you, sweetheart.<eos> It's Dora's.<eos> Pick something else for your dying wish.<eos> Oh, no. I mean, if she really wants it...
I'll put you on my prayer list.<eos> Oh, she likes your necklace.<eos> Yeah, it's very pretty, isn't it?<eos> Oh, you...<eos> You want it? Oh, Stephanie, it doesn't belong to you, sweetheart.<eos> It's Dora's.<eos> Pick something else for your dying wish.<eos> Oh, no. I mean, if she really wants it...<eos> Oh, no, we'll get her some ice cream or something.<eos> No, no, no. I want you to have it.
- Didn't even get a name.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm Dr. Lin.<eos> I see you have a cut on your head there, Ms...?<eos> Uh, I'm actually fine.<eos> I was just about to go.<eos> I think you should stay here.<eos> Um, can you tell me what happened?<eos> It's just I've-I've, uh, lost my purse, but I'll-I'll come back after I've found it.<eos> Oh, we can have someone find it for you.
Uh, I'm actually fine.<eos> I was just about to go.<eos> I think you should stay here.<eos> Um, can you tell me what happened?<eos> It's just I've-I've, uh, lost my purse, but I'll-I'll come back after I've found it.<eos> Oh, we can have someone find it for you.<eos> Do you know where you saw it last?<eos> I fell down in the street on my way.<eos> Um, I think it's probably just outside.<eos> - Somebody could steal it.
- Okay. - Grab that arm.<eos> - Keep her from pulling out that I.V.<eos> - Let's get some high-flow O2 in here!<eos> Okay, protect her airway.<eos> Let's move this bed!<eos> Natalie you had a seizure, okay?<eos> - But we've got you.<eos> - Just hold her down.<eos> - Okay, where's that tox screen?<eos> - I'll get it. - Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
- Yeah. I read.<eos> Angelo, if you... if you carry on with your current occupation, a new elbow's not gonna last you two years.<eos> And it's gonna be worse off than before.<eos> We're talking about immobility, scar tissue, nerve damage.<eos> Cut to the chase.<eos> You need to start thinking about getting another job.<eos> What are you... a surgeon or a guidance counselor?<eos> Come on, guys.<eos> There's got to be another option.<eos> Well, normally I would repair it using plates and screws...
There's got to be another option.<eos> Well, normally I would repair it using plates and screws...<eos> Fine.<eos> Do that.<eos> If it doesn't work, we can talk about me quitting my job.<eos> Uh, actually, we need to talk about that right now.<eos> I need your permission for both options...<eos> In case I open up your arm, and depending on what I find...<eos> All right. Get me the consent form.<eos> Bring it here, and I'll sign it.
Wait.<eos> Let me throw in a couple of sutures, and then, uh, give me a minute.<eos> He's stabilizing.<eos> Give me a towel, please.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> - Is he okay?<eos> - He's stable.<eos> Dr. Williams, what happened in there?<eos> I thought I was cutting through an adhesion, and the bile duct was underneath.<eos> So you fix it with a stitch.
Our parents would have got on famously.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Fletch...<eos> Vera, there's something I need to...<eos> I need to say.<eos> OK, you...<eos> It's good you're here.<eos> I've realised something about my accident.<eos> There was nothing accidental about it.<eos> I did it to myself.
- A.J.?<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> I let someone sleep here.<eos> Damn it, Callie.<eos> Why?<eos> You're fired.<eos> Mariana: Are you almost done in there?<eos> You do know that we're in the worst drought since 800 A.D., right?<eos> Stef: Oh my gosh, I forgot my conditioner.<eos> Can you go get it from our bathroom, honey?
Spiteri and Smith.<eos> What do you know?<eos> I'm not going there anymore.<eos> Really?<eos> Mmm.<eos> You sure?<eos> Yeah, I'm sure.<eos> We're done.<eos> I have a draft copy of my report for your parole hearing.<eos> Would you care to have a read of it?
Bloody love cardamom.<eos> So, now that you've tossed my place, is there anything else you're looking for, Detective?<eos> We'll let you know when we find it.<eos> What else?<eos> Ginger.<eos> Sorry for the disturbance, Mr Jackson.<eos> We'll leave you in peace now.<eos> What are you doing with my laptop?<eos> Routine enquiries.<eos> Let you know when you can come and pick it up.
You and your...<eos> You fuckin' watch it!<eos> You and your mate!<eos> You just watch what you're fuckin' saying!<eos> Yeah, alright, alright.<eos> Alright, alright.<eos> Ya mongrel. Disappear.<eos> Change her bed.<eos> Put the old mattress out here.<eos> I'll organise someone to pick it up, please.
You fuckin' watch it!<eos> You and your mate!<eos> You just watch what you're fuckin' saying!<eos> Yeah, alright, alright.<eos> Alright, alright.<eos> Ya mongrel. Disappear.<eos> Change her bed.<eos> Put the old mattress out here.<eos> I'll organise someone to pick it up, please.<eos> I'll make it for you, Dor.
Yeah.<eos> Hey, uh, I need you to find out who this Jianna is, OK?<eos> And what she means to Ferguson.<eos> Why?<eos> I just...<eos> I just need you to, alright?<eos> OK.<eos> Good.<eos> Why is that goldfish still here?<eos> I like looking at it.
I'm not here to treat staff.<eos> I think I used to be a bit of a bastard.<eos> Before the accident.<eos> And now you're not?<eos> I just, um, who I was then and who I am now, I can't connect them.<eos> I've been getting these, um, flashes.<eos> I'm not sure if they're memories, or...<eos> They could be memories.<eos> You've lost time because of the accident.<eos> Your brain's trying to find it.
The Honorable Judge Dunaway presiding.<eos> Thank you all.<eos> You may sit.<eos> Mr. Brody and Ms. Audrey... Well, actually, you... you have someone new here.<eos> Yes, Your Honor.<eos> Alicia Florrick, asking leave of the court to join as co-counsel.<eos> - Any objections, Mr. Brody?<eos> - None, Your Honor.<eos> We do not hold the recent election scandal against Alicia Florrick at all.<eos> Of course, that's why you brought it up, so it won't be held against her.
What is it you want from me?<eos> I want in.<eos> My dark lord is already inside the boy.<eos> And come the comet...<eos> We shall let him out.<eos> What kind of mother would abandon her only child to the woods?<eos> The night is our playground.<eos> You said that once you were sure, you would tell me the secret tor destroying Countess Marburg.<eos> You spoke of an object.<eos> She keeps it close.
I used it to summon his soul.<eos> Risking necromancy without my aid is dangerous enough, but to raise Increase Mather from the dead...<eos> Your aid?<eos> I have new allies.<eos> Do not worry your cowardly mind.<eos> I've already sent him back from whence he came.<eos> But his specter proved quite useful.<eos> Apparently our Countess has a weakness...<eos> Her ancient, rotting corpse is the secret to her longevity.<eos> Increase told me where to find it, and at the right moment, it and she will be mine.
Why?<eos> Would it make a difference?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Maybe make me think that you were worth loving once upon a time.<eos> War.<eos> War against all our enemies.<eos> The very ones whose demise we dreamt of in our youth...<eos> The black-cloaked hypocrites who branded our friends, forbade our love, crushed all our hopes and dreams.<eos> I did nothing on my own behalf but everything for the world I thought we both wanted.<eos> And if it took their blood, all of their blood, to build it, then so be it.
Nothing.<eos> I told Holden I was keeping Antoine safe.<eos> The next thing I knew, he was here.<eos> And where's he at now?<eos> Look, all I know is Gretchen was checking on Antoine when he showed up.<eos> I called you as soon as I heard.<eos> Last night the cops was gonna solve all your problems, and today you called me.<eos> Let's go.<eos> They make you wear that mask all the time?<eos> Yeah, you have to wear it when you clean, and then you have to change your clothes before you see patients... It's a pain.
Jianna.<eos> I need you to find out who this Jianna is.<eos> I think Ferguson was in love with her or something.<eos> She really is a freak.<eos> Slot her.<eos> You're a fucking battered old whore!<eos> I've been getting these flashes.<eos> I'm not sure if they're memories.<eos> You've lost time because of the accident.<eos> Your brain's trying to find it.
No, I'm just thinking.<eos> Um, overtime budget.<eos> I don't think we'll meet it this month.<eos> Oh, we can beat it into the next.<eos> As long as we're right for the end of the quarter.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Welcome.<eos> You're all busy, so we'll move through these items quickly.<eos> Now, her doctor tells me that her right eye is permanently damaged.<eos> She may yet lose it.
What don't I get?<eos> Huh?<eos> What don't I fuckin' get?<eos> I told Bridget something - something bad I'd done, and someone recorded it.<eos> Is this about Meg Jackson?<eos> How do you know about that?<eos> Never mind.<eos> Who's got the recording?<eos> Mr Jackson.<eos> Is he gonna take it to the cops?
Righto, let's go.<eos> Pick up pick up pick up.<eos> Yep. It's me.<eos> They're onto you.<eos> Do it now and get out.<eos> Hey! So who's got the phone?<eos> I haven't got time to mess around, so who's got it?<eos> No-one.<eos> Let's take a walk. I'm not gonna get angry.<eos> I just want to use it and then maybe you'll get it back.
You guys got somewhere to be?<eos> All prisoners return to your units.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> What's this?<eos> Evidence.<eos> That DNA will match the sample you found on Harry's body.<eos> Take a seat, Mr Jackson.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Test the sample.<eos> Yeah, sure. I'll just run it through my portable lab kit, shall I?
He has 'em all brainwashed.<eos> The ones that don't believe he's God are convinced he's the devil.<eos> Either case, we can't break 'em.<eos> You can't break the ice?<eos> Ha, ha, ha. No, we can't.<eos> Chief Kent couldn't either, try as he might.<eos> Everyone and everything has a breaking point.<eos> If you know where it is, and nobody does with these guys.<eos> It's there, Sid.<eos> We're just not seeing it yet.
Well, the truth is I am kind of bored in middle school, and the boys in my class are really childish.<eos> They draw boobs on everything.<eos> Yeah, I'm not really sure that's gonna change in high school.<eos> You know, I was kinda dreading the eighth grade.<eos> But now I might even look forward to the fall.<eos> And now it's even less likely there'll be any repercussions from the...<eos> Well, you said you didn't wanna know.<eos> Hey, Carly.<eos> Do you know what happened to my yearbook?<eos> Brad said he might've given it to you.
Still... now that none of us are going to die...<eos> - You've a nerve coming here.<eos> - Haven't I?<eos> See, now that there's a future, I've been thinking what it holds for me, what kind of man will I be?<eos> And the answer I've come up is rich.<eos> And that's where you come in.<eos> I'd like my inheritance now, please.<eos> This amount, first day of every month, into this account.<eos> After all, it'd be a terrible shame if the world was to find out you're actually alive.<eos> Now that there is a future, you really wanna spend it behind bars?
Too many people have died today.<eos> We're not adding this kid to the list.<eos> - How's his airway?<eos> - His sats are okay.<eos> There's definitely blood in his chest on the left side.<eos> I can't really reach it from this angle.<eos> Uh, I need some more trauma pads and cellulose polymer, please.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Whenever I press on the wound, blood is flowing out of his abdomen.<eos> The metal is tamponading it, but it's not going to last very long.
Dolly Madison.<eos> You little vixen.<eos> Jackie O-no-you-didn't!<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> Michelle Obama.<eos> Talk about winning the arms race.<eos> Phil, I just said something really funny!<eos> Put that bill into committee, Phil.<eos> Put it in there.
No, yeah, I get it, Carol.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good.<eos> We cannot let that vote pass.<eos> - Not on our watch.<eos> - There's too much pork in that bill.<eos> - Way too much pork.<eos> - Block that vote.<eos> - I'm blocking it!
Uh-huh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good.<eos> We cannot let that vote pass.<eos> - Not on our watch.<eos> - There's too much pork in that bill.<eos> - Way too much pork.<eos> - Block that vote.<eos> - I'm blocking it!<eos> - Block it!
She cares, that's her thing.<eos> - Have you heard of recycling?<eos> - No, I...<eos> What she hasn't grasped is the detrimental effect of all these rotten toothed little imps.<eos> The women around here would help the planet more by keeping their legs crossed.<eos> This one's late.<eos> Doesn't want to come out.<eos> Mummy.<eos> Toby's got a radio set.<eos> You have to build it yourself.
Thank you very much.<eos> Floor 25.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Hi, Jean, it's me.<eos> Listen, I'm not gonna come in this morning.<eos> Wait.<eos> What about munrow?<eos> Did he turn up for that scan?<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Well, leave it on my desk if it turns up.
At least until all of this blows over.<eos> Restrain that intruder!<eos> There, look! What we need is a good sturdy chain!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm packing to leave.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Has anyone actually made a formal complaint to the owners?<eos> We are the owners.<eos> Pass me that green thing.<eos> Daddy likes to see me in it.
A modest project which, nevertheless, required careful and cautious planning.<eos> For now, he would sit back, eat the rest of the dog and wait for failure to reach the second tower of the high-rise development.<eos> Ready to welcome its residents into this new world... With open arms.<eos> I heard you out there.<eos> Who were you talking to?<eos> No-one.<eos> Just the building.<eos> The free enterprise system is a necessary but not a sufficient condition.<eos> There is only one economic system in the world and that is capitalism.<eos> The difference lies in whether the capital is in the hands of the state or whether the greater part of it is in the hands of people outside of state control.
And it looks like it's having an effect.<eos> Maybe you could start by telling us what happened to your daughter.<eos> What did Dr. Henson do to her?<eos> Tuesdays, 4:00 to 7:00, Stephanie had a study group, a very unofficial thing with her friends, and so we... we let them u-use the pool house.<eos> My wife got home that night after I did.<eos> We cooked dinner, watched some television, then I got a headache around 8:00.<eos> I went to the medicine cabinet, and it was empty...<eos> Advil, Benadryl, my wife's Xanax... everything.<eos> W-when we were eating dinner, uh, Stephanie was lying on the floor in the pool house, all those empty pill bottles around her, including those dangerous antidepressants that Henson prescribed.<eos> She was clutching her phone like she was hugging it, the way she used to hold her little stuffed animals.
Did you get what I asked for?<eos> Why did you order Ayo to prepare a syringe of potassium methochloride?<eos> You ratted me out.<eos> As medical officer I had to.<eos> Remind me to fire you.<eos> Uh, what's going on?<eos> You said I clocked the car outside the restaurant?<eos> That means it's possible I saw the license plates, maybe even the guy in the car Barbiero was talking to.<eos> That memory is inside my head, likely in the central executive part of the pre-frontal cortex.<eos> You're gonna go in and find it.
Hello.<eos> I'm sorry. I've-I've forgotten your name.<eos> - I'm Dr. Emory.<eos> - I remember.<eos> - I'm Carrie. - Oh.<eos> - May I join you, Carrie?<eos> - Of course.<eos> So, he's out of surgery.<eos> But the hematoma was very large.<eos> We had to perform a craniotomy, drain it and repair the bleed.
What was science fiction yesterday is a reality today.<eos> Hahn and Strassmann work at the Kaiser Wilhelm Insti--<eos> - No, no.<eos> Turn that back, please.<eos> ...blocks of all matter.<eos> German scientists have managed to split the atom, releasing 200 million volts.<eos> A major discovery in physics, atomic energy could become a promising source of fuel in the decades to come.<eos> It's called a neutron.<eos> It's a particle inside the nucleus of an atom.<eos> When you bombard uranium with neutrons, you can split it apart, releasing all of that, uh-- that energy, that power that's locked inside.
Right.<eos> Right, um... [ahem]<eos> I have a dream! Oh!<eos> [laughs] You nut.<eos> But will his bloodlust end there? Who knows?<eos> The Shepherd Lake Lunatic could be right here among us, ready to kill again!<eos> Nobody wants to bob for apples?<eos> (Buddy) Hey, been looking for you.<eos> Great job on the costume, by the way. Oh, thanks.<eos> You wear it well.
I promised I wouldn't give your money back until Bingo-mania was over.<eos> I don't care how many balding eagles or magicians you make up.<eos> Gallagher is not a magician.<eos> He's a prop comic... and a genius.<eos> And I want my money.<eos> - Dora...<eos> Buddy, please... before Donna gives my spot to someone else.<eos> All right!<eos> All right.<eos> I'll go get it... right after I tend to a church member who's in desperate need of help.
I've always left it to Simon, but I've realised perhaps maybe I should pay more attention.<eos> I thought you could talk me through it. Sure.<eos> Over dinner maybe.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> And maybe don't mention it to Simon.<eos> I wouldn't want him thinking that I don't trust him. Of course.<eos> Well, just let me know when.<eos> Simon's right, this is historic.<eos> I gave Karl Lucas a hand job against that wall in 1993.<eos> And now, they're knocking it down!
I might've gone to bed.<eos> Does Tom know what he's having for dinner?<eos> Yes.<eos> And is there anything for...<eos> Leftovers in the fridge.<eos> Crisps are in the bottom left cupboard.<eos> Tom can show you if you get stuck.<eos> Right...<eos> I know this is weird, but I... I ordered a copy of this book, but I must've ordered it twice cos I got two copies through.<eos> And I thought, well, you're just down the road, you might want it.
Whatever's going on, some time off would be a good idea, wouldn't it?<eos> What did you tell the police?<eos> - What?<eos> - You said they asked about procedure?<eos> - Yes. - Something was said to them here to make them suspect me.<eos> All right, well, er, they asked about our access to pills.<eos> - And I told them what I found in your bag.<eos> - Why were you looking in my bag?<eos> I wasn't looking!<eos> I needed some hand gel and your bag was there on the side and open, and when I found it, I saw that there was... a bottle of sleeping pills with some anti-sickness medication.
All the writers and actors.<eos> Thursday is rewrite night.<eos> So most of them were here until sunup.<eos> Of those people, did anyone have a problem with Sid?<eos> Who?<eos> Sorry, sir, we're not quite open yet.<eos> Uh, I record all of our rehearsals.<eos> This took place yesterday evening.<eos> Dude, why are you wearing armor?<eos> Because the sketch sucks, and I'm trying to save it!
Uh, he's around back, doing another sweep.<eos> Ok. Well, stay warm.<eos> Oh, damn.<eos> So we ready to play?<eos> You bet you.<eos> We're just waiting for mommy, right, guys?<eos> Who do you want to be?<eos> Do you want to be this guy?<eos> Yeah! well, you have to choose your character.<eos> Can you put it back down there again?
But when she does, I'm allowed to come here.<eos> With Henry.<eos> I, um... brought you a present.<eos> Cool.<eos> A piece of paper.<eos> Open it.<eos> You do know I'm still at the age where I would play with a doll, right?<eos> A doll would've been fine.<eos> Duly noted.<eos> Just open it.
Answer me.<eos> All your time, spent searching for the book.<eos> You haven't learned a thing, you...!<eos> I've learned you can always make things more painful.<eos> Do you like that?<eos> No, please.<eos> Okay, now the guy who runs this place is kind of an odd duck.<eos> So, no eye contact, no conversations.<eos> Book me, Pablo.<eos> Are you sure that he can read it?
Okay, now the guy who runs this place is kind of an odd duck.<eos> So, no eye contact, no conversations.<eos> Book me, Pablo.<eos> Are you sure that he can read it?<eos> Yeah, he said he could, but you know, that was years ago.<eos> First time I came here, I was looking for an authentic Viking helmet.<eos> I was bangin' this freaky chick who got me way into role-playing.<eos> I don't wanna hear this.<eos> Anyway, I told him about the book, and he freaked out.<eos> He said he can translate it, no problemo.
So why are you doing this?<eos> Creating a space for the summoning.<eos> A connection between our world and theirs.<eos> Please, hand me the incense.<eos> Watch the circle.<eos> Guys, this is bad.<eos> No, no, it's- it's perfectly safe.<eos> Just don't break the circle, and the demon remains contained.<eos> But reading from the book is what caused all this trouble to begin with, so...<eos> Yeah, that's true, but reading from it again can't make things any worse.
Last chance!<eos> Hey Lionel, send this know-nothing waste of time back where it came from.<eos> - Um... - Nobody move!<eos> And what the fuck is that thing?<eos> ! Come on, lady, you ruined my day twice already with this bullshit.<eos> Put the weapon down, or I will shoot you!<eos> Well as you can see, we're just a little busy here.<eos> Now!<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Lionel, send it back!
What is that thing?<eos> Ash summoned a demon.<eos> He did what?<eos> Hiyaa! - Lionel, hurry up!<eos> - Yeah I'm-I'm trying!<eos> - Fuck...!<eos> - We have to do something!<eos> We have to get to that book!<eos> That won't help!<eos> No one else can read it!
Come and see this amazing competition!<eos> Never before seen!<eos> Jhonta!<eos> And now, ladies and gentlemen... these kids will dive<eos> Jhonta!<eos> He's not here.<eos> Bet on someone else<eos> Put your money on Babua.<eos> He's sure to win!<eos> Put it on Babua
- Go.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You heard him. Let's go.<eos> Let's move.<eos> Abu Omar has claimed my wife, Daliyah, as his own.<eos> She is, by all rights, still mine.<eos> Please... accept this money in return for her.<eos> It may not seem much to you, but this is all the money I have in the world.<eos> I can get more, if that's what it takes.<eos> Please take it.
Good morning.<eos> Good mor...<eos> Yeah, it's good, right?<eos> It's artisanal almond butter.<eos> Well, "A", I'm really impressed that you know how to use the word "artisanal."<eos> And "B", umm, almond butter?<eos> It's $15 a jar!<eos> We can't afford it!
So, that means my apartment has a cash dollar money view.<eos> (Gasps) (Whispering) Are you hearing this?<eos> Oh... my God!<eos> Guys...<eos> I just got invited to an Ed Talk.<eos> Congratulations!<eos> This is huge!<eos> Wow, that's amazing!<eos> If I knew what it was, I'd be more sincere.<eos> Gabi, an Ed talk is when they invite this extremely successful person to give this inspirational speech, and they live-stream it.
I want you to come close.<eos> I'm going to share my opening joke.<eos> Why was the computer stressed out when it got home?<eos> 'Cause it had a hard drive.<eos> Bam!<eos> Well, this thing's obviously broken.<eos> Hi.<eos> Gabi, it's been three days.<eos> Why is the blender still here?<eos> Well, remember when you said that if I could figure out a way to pay for the blender without using our rent money, I could keep it?
It's the moment you've all been waiting for.<eos> (Sniffs) Wait a minute.<eos> You went to a fancy charity function last night.<eos> I smell rich people things.<eos> Ooh, is it a swag bag?<eos> Please tell me it's a swag bag.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Wait, I don't get it.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Every time I go to a big event I get this gift bag full of really cool stuff and I let Elliot and Yolanda divvy it up.

The hell it isn't.<eos> She's probably getting a hundred dollar blowout right now.<eos> And I'm gonna blow out these pants if don't get a stronger Spanx.<eos> I'll see y'all later.<eos> (Giggles) Okay, now it's time for my favorite part of Christmas, buying each other gifts under... ♪ $20. ♪<eos> Oh! Is this Gucci purse under $20?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> But you know what is?<eos> - What?<eos> - A picture of you wearing it.
Thanks, Gabi.<eos> Now it's the worst Christmas ever!<eos> I feel so bad about JoJo and Yolanda.<eos> I mean, why couldn't they work it out?<eos> Damn those sisters.<eos> Oh, not you sisters.<eos> Big fan of your work.<eos> Gabi, can we focus on what's really important here?<eos> I'm starting to feel really guilty about my purse.<eos> Okay, so then return it.
What's it look like?<eos> Alan's gone, and I'm sad eating peppermint bark on your floor.<eos> You wanna talk about it?<eos> What's the point?<eos> Alan's already on the cruise.<eos> I'd rather talk about why you look like Gumby.<eos> What?<eos> This is my gear.<eos> Crazy Pete said we're not just going skiing, we're going ultimate extreme skiing.<eos> He actually sent me a video of guys doing it.

Hey, guys. What are you doing here?<eos> Stopping you from swindling your sister.<eos> Yeah. I saw you making out with Father Gary.<eos> Look, I don't know why you did what you did, and I don't care.<eos> Well, I care, okay?<eos> And I have one thing to say...<eos> I finally understand why Yolanda didn't talk to you for five years.<eos> - You are not a nice lady!<eos> Look, there is no way I'm gonna let Yolanda get hurt.<eos> So when she shows up to give you the money, you're not gonna take it.
- Yes.<eos> You have a huge heart, but I already make more than every other secretary at the firm, so- 2% it is.<eos> - Thanks, Louis.<eos> Don't mention it.<eos> Hey, do you have a second?<eos> I need your legal advice about something.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> What is it?<eos> My fiancée left this prenup in the kitchen.<eos> I'm just wondering if you think I should sign it.
Hey, do you have a second?<eos> I need your legal advice about something.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> What is it?<eos> My fiancée left this prenup in the kitchen.<eos> I'm just wondering if you think I should sign it.<eos> Mike, it's not what it looks like.<eos> It looks like your father had a prenup prepared for you to make me sign.<eos> Then it's exactly what it looks like.<eos> And I'm guessing you don't want me to sign it?
I prefer my men manly.<eos> Am I not manly?<eos> Well, if you have to ask...<eos> Mike, how you doing?<eos> Robert.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> I heard you wanted me to sign a prenup.<eos> I did.<eos> I hope you didn't take it personally.<eos> Of course not, I'm happy to sign it, but Rachel did say that you don't know what kind of guy I am, so I thought I'd come here to show you that this is the kind of guy I am.
And get Louis fired?<eos> He wouldn't be in this mess if you'd have just stopped him from doing this in the first place.<eos> Harvey, if I knew Louis was gonna do something like this, and I'm not saying I did, then I would have told him to his face not to.<eos> But if he went ahead and did it anyway, then I'm not gonna go behind his back to fix it.<eos> Because you always said, "Once you pick a side,<eos> "if you're not loyal to that side, then who the hell are you?"<eos> Then you should have thought of that before you picked someone who would do something like this in the first place.<eos> You want to know what kind of man Louis is?<eos> This whole thing started because he wanted to prove to you that he had your back, because he thought you were jealous of us.<eos> No, this whole thing started because I told him that I've been paying your salary since we came to the firm, and he was too cheap to pay it himself and too weak to tell you the truth.
So you know we're talking about my father, right, who's no longer alive?<eos> - Yeah, I forgot that.<eos> - You forgot that?<eos> The basis of your compliment in the first place?<eos> You suck the fun out of everything, don't you?<eos> You did this quickly.<eos> You gave me a job to do, and I did it.<eos> And why did you leave it on my desk instead of bringing it to me directly?<eos> I just wanted to give you a chance to look it over.<eos> And does that have something to do with the fact that I asked you to check it for exposure and not rewrite it?
- Got it.<eos> [indistinct radio chatter] [dramatic music] [glass shatters] One, two, three.<eos> [loud explosion] [crowd exclaiming] (boden) get a line on that truck!<eos> [indistinct shouting] (cruz) let's move!<eos> Chief!<eos> Look out! Truck's rolling!<eos> Oh, god. (boden) everybody move, now!<eos> Lift him!<eos> ¶ ¶ [indistinct shouting] [panting] damn.<eos> [groans] [exhales] [indistinct shouting] Okay, let's get some water on it.
Let's get Matt a drink here.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Okay.<eos> We're opening five more clubs, and our investors want to know if you'll accept cash.<eos> We're also willing to allow an extra 5% in markups if you do the work off-book.<eos> I know this sounds a little shady, but it's all about our cash-on-hand right now.<eos> What happened?<eos> We lost you.<eos> Your wire's in the toilet.<eos> You're welcome to dig it out.
Um, I'm at his place.<eos> one of the girls from the club, she's here.<eos> She's been shot.<eos> She's dead, and I don't know where Casey is.<eos> Okay, we got a pinging order on his phone.<eos> Hang tight.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, where is it?<eos> She's always writing in a notebook.<eos> Where does she keep it?
I chose him because I knew he wouldn't hurt the team.<eos> In the meantime, I am gonna bat for you as best I can.<eos> I have convinced Riddle to reassess your rank further down the road, provided you complete some management training.<eos> [chuckles]<eos> "Leadership Hub of Chicago presents:<eos> Getting Troubled Managers Back on Track."<eos> This is a joke, right, Chief?<eos> This is how you go to bat for me?<eos> You have to register for that today.<eos> You know, Chief, I'll take the damn course, I'll take it and I'll get my bugle back, but I don't know that I can stay here and work under Patterson.
[sighs] We never would have made it to Med in time.<eos> It was the right call.<eos> Okay.<eos> You did good.<eos> [sighs]<eos> You got bad news.<eos> [sighs] First up, how are you doing?<eos> Fine.<eos> Find Katya's notebook yet?<eos> Can't even look for it.
And I have to tell my daughter why she's dying, even though there are people who have a medicine that could save her life.<eos> Her name's Clementine.<eos> She's ten. We first discovered she had Glazier's Syndrome when she was seven.<eos> So, basically, as long as she can remember,<eos> - she's been the kid who's dying.<eos> That's not what I want to hear from you.<eos> What I want to hear is:<eos> yes, of course your daughter can have the drug that can cure her.<eos> Followed by the question:<eos> when can we deliver it?
I know why you want to find her. You want to start fucking her again, don't you?<eos> You're the one that shared her with me, Your Eminence.<eos> It's my way of keeping her in the temple.<eos> But you know what?<eos> I can give this map to el profesor myself.<eos> I don't even need you anymore.<eos> I built your flesh business.<eos> And now that she knows you're using it to feed, she'll attack again.<eos> You know she's trying to find this place.<eos> She'll never find it.
Are you sure the boy is really yours, let alone mine?<eos> I'm sure.<eos> And when you look into his eyes, you will be, too.<eos> Well, Cotton's on board.<eos> So, what's the play?<eos> I've come from the docks.<eos> The countess has our son on board.<eos> But for all her power and knowledge, she does not know you even exist.<eos> To keep living century after century, she carries with her the first body she inhabited.<eos> Find it, destroy it, and the bitch can be run through with a dull blade.
- That'll come later.<eos> Elliot, listen to me.<eos> I will never leave you.<eos> I will never leave you alone again.<eos> - Who are you talking to?<eos> - Since last month,<eos> - Evil Corp has moved its tapes to five...<eos> - Five backup facilities and you have a plan to take them all down.<eos> Why are you working with us?<eos> The hack, everything, maybe we shouldn't execute it.
The investigation is still underway.<eos> The FBI Cybercrime Division is working with...<eos> Where's my bag?<eos> I need my bag.<eos> It... it has all my papers.<eos> I put all of your talking points on these index cards<eos> - so that you wouldn't have to...<eos> - God damn it!<eos> Will you please just give me my bag, for Christ's sake?<eos> I asked you to keep it close by.
Thanks.<eos> Evelyne St. Clair, my name is Michel Dorn.<eos> I'm the... chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court, in The Hague.<eos> Surely, you're not going to charge my husband? !<eos> No.<eos> No, we just need to find him, so that we can help him, and help your son.<eos> I just want to get back to the house.<eos> I wanted you to come here so that you could see for yourself<eos> - just how grave the danger is.<eos> - I see it.
I was.<eos> A sexually active woman is a powerful force.<eos> She exudes the scent.<eos> The scent?<eos> Pheromones.<eos> The scent lets him know you're ready to engage.<eos> Like a wolf.<eos> But what if I don't have a scent?<eos> You do.<eos> You just need to meet another wolf to bring it out.
Good morning to you too.<eos> Drew, the lemons?<eos> Ah, there were fruit flies, so I had to throw them out.<eos> Okay. That seems unlikely, since I just bought them yesterday.<eos> I see you got the dishwasher.<eos> Floor model, 200 bucks off.<eos> Ok, but, you know, it was supposed to be the same as the one that we had.<eos> It's a dishwasher.<eos> That doesn't match the kitchen.<eos> Do you want me to take it back?
Maybe you sacrifice too much for this family?<eos> For Laura.<eos> I loved you, Val, and for a long time, I loved our marriage, and I wish that we could've worked things out, but... we didn't.<eos> Val.<eos> Oh, the "lighting move."<eos> Yeah, very subtle.<eos> It's almost like they want to tell us something.<eos> - There's a whiskey bar on 7th.<eos> - Hm. You don't like whiskey?<eos> No, I like it, I like it fine, I just... like it at my place with my music, on my record player, at my volume, with my choice of company, and my... queen bed.
That's... Well... it's insane.<eos> The inmates are loose around here.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> If that was...<eos> too cruel.<eos> Listen, they're, uh...<eos> they're closing up, so we have to get going.<eos> I'm not an idiot.<eos> All right?<eos> I'm not gonna just give my money to some stranger on the promise that he's gonna deliver it to some mysterious insurgency just 'cause he asks for it.
Technical engineer.<eos> OK, would he be capable of extracting the polonium?<eos> Yes.<eos> Of course.<eos> That is, if we ignore the fact that he hasn't worked at the plant for years.<eos> Mason's taken two trips to Belgium a month for the past year and a half.<eos> He definitely had the opportunity.<eos> What if Korsten was teaching him how to extract the polonium?<eos> That's why Mason's been going to Belgium, for lessons.<eos> Mason steals the polonium, he gives it to Fazio, Fazio smuggles it across to Korsten.
- Get in the car.<eos> All of you.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I know you took the polonium.<eos> - That's ludicrous.<eos> - Your friend, Korsten, had the expertise to extract the polonium.<eos> He taught you how.<eos> Believe me, Johnny's been in no condition to teach me anything.<eos> No one suspected the, uh, unequipped plant coordinator.<eos> You were able to steal the polonium, and give it to Fazio, before anyone notice it was gone.
If we can make it there, we're home free.<eos> You're doing great, baby.<eos> Tranq guns!<eos> Look out!<eos> Good job, honey.<eos> We are some kind of team.<eos> Well, looks like they've decided to put us in a private room.<eos> Let the anniversary begin.<eos> I'm not kissing you, you jerk.<eos> This was supposed to be our anniversary, and we're spending it in a...
Previously on "Casual"...<eos> Who's the worst person I look like?<eos> How about an upside-down Mop?<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Thought you were happy Mom left.<eos> Maybe I'm not supposed to be happy.<eos> A sexually active woman is a powerful force.<eos> She exudes the scent.<eos> What if I don't have a scent?<eos> You just need to meet another wolf to bring it out.
No beer pong.<eos> No basic bitches.<eos> There's gonna be a DJ and everything.<eos> Like at your bat mitzvah?<eos> Will you talk to me?<eos> Leave her alone, you fucking troll.<eos> It's fine. It's...<eos> - I think I know what happened.<eos> - You do?<eos> If your laptop was open, somebody could have hacked it and turned on the camera.
Care for an "eye d'oeuvre"?<eos> - Eye d'oeuvre?<eos> - Yeah, they're for the party.<eos> It's mozzarella, a little black olive, and a touch of food coloring for that creepy, bloodshot look.<eos> Are you seriously going ahead with the party?<eos> Uh, funny story.<eos> I may have accidentally told a couple of people about finding Devon's house, and then, one of them may have group chatted the address.<eos> Come on, it'll be fine.<eos> It's just one night.<eos> And besides, the whole place is in limbo until the state claims it.
You're wrong, sir.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I said, "you're wrong."<eos> In every case you have referenced,<eos> I have not only successfully brought the killer to justice, but I did so with the utmost respect for the law and for the department I represent.<eos> And regarding my relationship with Mr. Castle, he has proven to be a brilliant partner, and he's always had my back.<eos> And as for his... fictional representation of me, I'm proud to have been his inspiration, and I am proud to be his wife.<eos> You asked, "how do I expect to lead?"<eos> By continuing to fight for what's right, not for what's easy.<eos> My job is to protect the citizens of New York, and I will do it by doing my job better than anyone else and getting results.
Now, why would he do that...<eos> wear a mask when he kills them?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - If you had to guess.<eos> What kind of psychosis would drive a man to do that?<eos> Something terrible in his childhood?<eos> The mind of a psychopath is not that simple.<eos> But he kills them anyway.<eos> So why would he need to hide his face behind this?<eos> Maybe he's not hiding it.

Way more scared than me.<eos> Well, the next time you're looking for adventure, you oughta knock on my door.<eos> A.J., you're my foster brother.<eos> I can't...<eos> Okay.<eos> What about when I'm not?<eos> When you're...<eos> When I move in with Mike.<eos> Um, then I guess we will cross that bridge...<eos> When we get to it?
But you were the one who chose to have an affair.<eos> How 'bout this?<eos> We put on a slow song...<eos> I'll ask A.J. to dance...<eos> I'll snuggle up to him, and you know... grab his phone out of his pocket.<eos> Um, no, you're 15.<eos> I'm not pimping you out just to prove my dad wrong.<eos> Fine.<eos> You want to dance with him?<eos> Or... we could just unplug his phone from the charger and take it.
You want to dance with him?<eos> Or... we could just unplug his phone from the charger and take it.<eos> It's got everything we need.<eos> Yeah, including a big dent in the bumper.<eos> - Which gives a character.<eos> - It's time that we negotiate.<eos> So?<eos> What do you think?<eos> - It's yours for $1,350.<eos> - We'll take it.
Where's my phone?<eos> - I haven't seen it.<eos> - Are you sure about that?<eos> - Give it to me.<eos> Now! - Who is this?<eos> Huh?<eos> - Who's calling?<eos> - How the hell am I supposed to know, you got my phone?<eos> - Hello!<eos> - I said give it to me.
He wants to hack Steel Mountain's climate control system, raise the facility's heat high enough to destroy all the tapes.<eos> And you think sticking this behind the thermostat will do all that?<eos> With the right software specifically designed.<eos> I'll pull up my research on the facility, start targeting which thermostats are the most accessible.<eos> Yeah, well, that's all well and good, but we still gotta get in the damn joint.<eos> There.<eos> Deep in the Adirondacks.<eos> In 145-plus acre former limestone mine.<eos> 3-ton steel gates, 24/7 armed guards, closed circuit cameras, NOC staffing.<eos> Sure you don't want to just blow it up?
All their tapes are still in the New York facility.<eos> Just means we go up today.<eos> We're nowhere close to being ready.<eos> Well, I've already downloaded all the necessary PDFs of the floor plans to target the thermostats.<eos> It will require some planning, but nothing I can't do in the car.<eos> It shouldn't take me long to own the facility's SCADA network.<eos> Especially with some help.<eos> You guys hit the road while Trenton helps me finish the distro.<eos> We'll double-time it.<eos> You can get it off the FTP server as soon as you get there.
- Come on, Alf.<eos> Closer!<eos> Closer!<eos> Bring it down!<eos> - Climb up.<eos> - Come on, Alfie.<eos> - Lower.<eos> - Come on, Alfie!<eos> - Jump!<eos> - Come on, Alfie, you can do it, darling!
Our interests are global.<eos> And we're all fighting for world dominance.<eos> That is why we fight and, yes, we fight brutally.<eos> Well, I feel sorry for you.<eos> I mean, this battle of yours is worth more than life itself.<eos> You once considered me a... a daughter.<eos> Yo... you don't think I suffered making that decision?<eos> It was the most painful moment in my life.<eos> - It broke my heart!<eos> - Then why do it?
He's gonna keep you safe. Okay?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - It's okay, honey.<eos> What do you mean keep us safe? What's happening?<eos> - Mommy? - Um...<eos> I can't stay.<eos> What?<eos> Why not?<eos> There's gonna be an article written by a woman called Isabel Rainey.<eos> You have to read it and believe it
What do I need to replicate the cure?<eos> Hmm...<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> Utopium from the night of the boat massacre.<eos> The tainted stuff.<eos> I remember having a limited supply...<eos> I remember asking you not to use up the last bit...<eos> Whatever happened to that?<eos> Passive aggressive is not a good look on you.<eos> Three months of trying to recreate it has gotten me nowhere.
Be a good girl.<eos> WENDELL:<eos> That's it.<eos> Be a good girl.<eos> Eat up, you ugly bitch.<eos> Think you can crap in my yard, do you?<eos> Hello?<eos> Anybody home?<eos> Wendell was offering a dog a rolled-up piece of bologna.<eos> He wanted to punish it for pooping in his yard.
Voice-mail: Next message.<eos> Man: Hey, "Alice," since that's what you're calling yourself nowadays,<eos> I understand it was a big mistake, but I promise you can trust me.<eos> And I-I need to know where you and Paloma are and that you're safe.<eos> Just call me back... please.<eos> I need to hear from you.<eos> [ Sighs ] And that's it.<eos> The most important message on Alice's phone, and I have no idea who it's from.<eos> Well, first, congratulations, because the way you found this message took hard work.<eos> But why play it for me instead of the police?
When did this happen to my house?<eos> A couple of hours ago.<eos> Now, your fellow Monsters may have misspelled it, but I'm pretty sure that that tag means that you snitched on a homicide.<eos> Might be because we just arrested Big Hazard for murder.<eos> What?<eos> Walk me through this.<eos> Maybe we've let people assume your client is going into the Witness Protection Program.<eos> You see, Twizz, we hid out where the stashed gun was found last night.<eos> What?<eos> And when Big Hazard went back for it, we surprised him.
Hello?<eos> Yeah, Jules.<eos> I've been so worried about you, Frank.<eos> I tried to reach you a few times.<eos> Uh, but there's no phone at the campsite, is there?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Uh, there isn't.<eos> You know, you left your necklace.<eos> I figured if you saw it, you'd know I left.
Who is he?<eos> He's a friend.<eos> Lot of guys look like him.<eos> This guy makes little paper animals.<eos> Oh. Yeah. I seen him.<eos> Where?<eos> Talking to Carl over at the bookstore.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To get a cup of coffee.<eos> Hey, Bucket, fill it up, will you?
It's not a line.<eos> I saw you this morning at the coffee bean, and then this afternoon at the gym, and now here.<eos> Why are you following me?<eos> ♪ We could be free<eos> So I could do this.<eos> ♪ We could be free<eos> ♪ I ain't at home<eos> ♪ home's where I'm going<eos> ♪ I close my eyes to see<eos> ♪ I'll take my throne, lay it on a mountain ♪ [Grunts]
Yep.<eos> The shooter was definitely up here.<eos> 9 millimeter.<eos> All right.<eos> Must have capped them from up here, boom, boom, boom, and then boogied out that exit.<eos> [Squish]<eos> Ew.<eos> Guys.<eos> Oh.<eos> Looks like our shooter took a bullet from one of the dead guys down there, falls back up against the wall, grabbing the drop cloth, pulling it down with him.
Oh, I like her.<eos> Yeah, but how are we supposed to track down someone like this?<eos> We can't look everywhere.<eos> If we can trace that hardware, that could give us a place to start.<eos> Take that down to Bobbi in the lab.<eos> - Have the team analyze it.<eos> - Oh, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> No, no, I'm... I'm... not going anywhere near Bobbi.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll take it to her myself.
We'll have to hit this thing with everything we've got.<eos> And I need a bigger gun, I guess.<eos> Or my ax.<eos> Or maybe a shotgun-ax combination of some sort.<eos> Oh, we going in here?<eos> Yeah, that makes sense.<eos> 911, what's your emergency?<eos> If we're both getting the call, then I think we know what it's about.<eos> You'll have to excuse me.<eos> If you don't take it out of my pocket, it's just gonna ring like that forever.
But thanks, oh, great master of melodrama.<eos> Why? Because it wasn't at all melodramatic when you whispered on your death bed,<eos> "I can't do this anymore."<eos> I meant pretend not to...<eos> You know...<eos> I didn't mean that we should make the tragic mistake of marrying each other... again.<eos> Call it what you will, but you've got the ring you once threw in my face, and we're shagging on the regular, so only thing missing is a piece of paper.<eos> And your ring, not that you know where it is.<eos> I know exactly where it is.<eos> Just don't personally own the scuba-diving equipment to retrieve it.
But if this is an outbreak, shouldn't the public be made aware?<eos> I think we should be careful, the words we start throwing around.<eos> The last thing we need is panic in the streets.<eos> Any threat will be eliminated, I can assure you.<eos> People have a right to know.<eos> Are the infected among us?<eos> Thank you.<eos> That'll be all for today.<eos> I've lived with a secret before.<eos> I was miserable until I came out with it.
- Kids. Um... - Wow.<eos> They're just kids.<eos> Jessica Tanner, 15 years old.<eos> Moving train swiped her, then tossed her down the embankment.<eos> GCS is 15.<eos> Pressure's 100 palp.<eos> Right side took all the brunt.<eos> One big bruise.<eos> There's a shortcut to... to school.<eos> I-I take it every day over... the tracks.
Stop!<eos> Don't play that video.<eos> The captain and I cannot hear that.<eos> Listening to that video could cause us to recuse ourselves from the trial.<eos> Which would further damage the prosecution.<eos> As the D.D.A., right now, I'm the only one here who can listen to what Slider said to you.<eos> And I'm gonna need your cell until we can find time to see the judge tomorrow.<eos> Oh... n... no, you're not, like, you're not taking my phone.<eos> Don't you need a warrant for that?<eos> Not if you just give it to her.
Just tell, uh, Judge Grove the truth.<eos> And what he hears on the video... oh.<eos> What he hears on the video will lead him to the right decision.<eos> Good luck.<eos> She just tells her dog to wait and then, when she gets to the door, she's too far away.<eos> Well, Dr. Morales said she couldn't talk after the attack, and during the 9-1-1 call,<eos> - her lungs were filling up with...<eos> - With blood, I know.<eos> But there's three months of Christa in Malcolm's files.<eos> Buzz, take this computer into Electronics and set it up.
If you withdraw your statement, we won't charge you as an accomplice after the fact to murder, and we'll make sure that...<eos> No, look, you have to understand, Felix didn't mean to do this.<eos> Okay, for a moment, he lost his temper.<eos> And he hit her and...<eos> And what?<eos> She fought back.<eos> All right, look, how did this all start?<eos> Can you tell us that?<eos> He received this weird text in the middle of the night.<eos> He wouldn't show it to me.
_<eos> Arshad told us the idea first.<eos> That we are to do what he said on the pitch.<eos> Play against our teammates.<eos> - And you said...?<eos> - No!<eos> Of course.<eos> Football is in my soul.<eos> I did not train my entire life to betray the game like this.<eos> But eventually you did betray it.
- Do you believe Mees is behind the bomb?<eos> - Of course.<eos> What makes you so certain?<eos> This was one of the games.<eos> Kalifa was to get red card, I was to give penalty away.<eos> Why didn't you?<eos> I looked at Kalifa in training, he could be something.<eos> Special, you know?<eos> Me, I'm OK, I get up and down, but him, this talent is a gift.<eos> And we were throwing it back in God's face.
She could have been a brilliant reporter.<eos> I just know it.<eos> She was so clever.<eos> What makes you think your sister was murdered?<eos> She had a story.<eos> She wouldn't tell me what it was.<eos> She'd sit just where you're sitting, and... and type on her laptop.<eos> Once she set her mind on something nothing would stop her.<eos> Um, her laptop?<eos> Do you know where we could find it?

A guy?<eos> Would you happen to know his name?<eos> Andre or...<eos> Antoine.<eos> I overheard her talking on the phone once, but, she never told me his name.<eos> She kept promising to bring him around, to meet me one day.<eos> But she never did.<eos> In the statement that you made to The Hague police, you said that Miss Jensen entered the lavatory with an overnight bag.<eos> That's right.<eos> She kept it on her lap the entire journey.
- Thank you, sir.<eos> I have another job for you.<eos> We have some loose ends.<eos> You got anything?<eos> I got a warrant to search Freja Jensen's online account.<eos> - A warrant?<eos> - See, you can teach an old dog new tricks.<eos> Unfortunately, it didn't yield much.<eos> I was rather hoping she'd cracked a big story.<eos> Well, if she did, she kept it off her email server.
Only a minute.<eos> I'm late to court.<eos> What?<eos> We think Miss Jensen discovered her sister's doctor was using a counterfeit drug on his patients and that's why she was killed.<eos> You can prove it?<eos> That he murdered her?<eos> But if we get a warrant to search the clinic, we can confiscate the drug<eos> - and we can charge him for that.<eos> - Carine, When Miss Jensen said that this was a story of international importance with thousands of lives at stake. She was not talking about the patients at that clinic.<eos> She was talking about the suppliers of that medicine, who are undoubtedly peddling it to hospitals all across Europe.
This tissue is all ash.<eos> Heat was so intense, the brain turned to vapor.<eos> This fissure on the suture line was caused by the escaping gases.<eos> So there's nothing I can get from the body?<eos> It's all on me, but I can handle this.<eos> I know.<eos> Angie, you okay?<eos> I ran the-the serial number from the gun-- you know, the gun you found on the ankle-- and...<eos> You got a name?<eos> Yeah, I couldn't believe it.
Let's go.<eos> You have our gratitude and respect, Maestro.<eos> Now we are one.<eos> I can't wait for my family to meet you.<eos> They're arriving tomorrow, first thing.<eos> It's about time.<eos> I was starting to doubt that they even existed.<eos> The day I've dreamt about for so long is finally here.<eos> It's going to be a whole new adventure.<eos> Thank you for sharing it with me.
You need to start drinking some water. Thanks, Peckham.<eos> I would drink an ocean for a guy like that.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Cheers!<eos> ALL: Cheers!<eos> Your back's going to break way before that wall does.<eos> I'm trying to leave my body.<eos> Send my spirit out like you did, in a coma.<eos> I can do that too.<eos> Matikutu reckons I can control it.
I can pay for it.<eos> I have a wallet.<eos> Whose wallet is this? I took it from the party.<eos> This is Kyle's wallet.<eos> He went to the bathroom with me and said not to tell anybody.<eos> Goddamn.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> Sorry, I guess Grant stole your wallet earlier.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> Just put it anywhere.
Oh, honey, those sound like white boys.<eos> Don't you know any Tyrones or Kelvins, or maybe a nice Knowshon?<eos> Oh, I do know one Tyrone.<eos> But he's in jail.<eos> Hm. That can happen to Tyrones.<eos> Why do you let your white friends say it?<eos> It's not like they mean anything by it.<eos> It's just a word.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> My generation fought to take that word back while your sexting, insta-dummy generation is giving it away to everybody.
Clearly... it's clear that that's very believable.<eos> You're not stopping my son from saying the "N" word.<eos> Mr. Johnson, what's the meaning of this?<eos> We're in the middle...<eos> The meaning is I know what you're trying to do, and it's not gonna work.<eos> You people are trying to eliminate a word from my son's vocabulary because you think it's ugly.<eos> Is it not?<eos> From you, it would be, and maybe Principal Green.<eos> You know he ain't even seen "Training Day"?<eos> So, maybe we should just let everyone say it since we don't have the right to say that no one can.
Fine.<eos> How do I find Merlin?<eos> I'm glad you asked.<eos> There's a magical force that can lead you wherever you need to be.<eos> Now, if you'll allow me, I can show you where to find it.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Imagine a mirrored lake, a tall tree with low-hanging branches that loom over it.<eos> Above it, a beautiful blue sky.<eos> Now, picture it in your mind's eye.

Worry not.<eos> Dark ones don't need sleep.<eos> That's why I spun straw.<eos> Passes the time.<eos> You need a hobby... something to take your mind off all the terrible things you're gonna do.<eos> Do you like knitting?<eos> In case you haven't noticed, I'm doing good here.<eos> I'm helping Merida, and then when she's done with the wisp, it'll be my turn.<eos> The wisp isn't a toy you can share.<eos> She can't just give it to you.

I want you to start behaving like a dark one!<eos> You knew this would happen.<eos> That's why you led me to her.<eos> You wanted me to betray Merida.<eos> Well-done, lad.<eos> How'd you know the code?<eos> My mom's good with magic.<eos> Not so much with passwords.<eos> She uses my birthday for everything.<eos> You'd think she'd change it after a bank statement or two.
How do you think it feels when everyone asks you how the adventure was, and you got to say that no one asked you to go along, that you weren't needed?<eos> We're not turning our back on you again, not even in the face of certain death.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Certain?<eos> Hold on tight, everyone!<eos> You did it.<eos> Now's the time.<eos> You want the wisp?<eos> There's only one way.<eos> Now do it.
Follow it.<eos> Follow my finger.<eos> Follow it.<eos> Keep following. Keep following.<eos> Sexyyyy.<eos> Look, we just wanted you guys to know that uh, Candace and I we're gonna... Try dating.<eos> Yeah, uh, I never knew it was right in front of me this whole time.<eos> Well, you know it's going to be easy for me to remember that your anniversary is October 9 because uh, today is also the first day I saw Justin Bieber's penis on the Internet.<eos> Yeah, well, as romantic as that is we are actually going to start dating tomorrow.<eos> Well then, I will look at it again tomorrow then.
- Briggs...<eos> Finally, the victim experiences convulsive spasms.<eos> Convulsive spasms and suffocation, and death occurs within ten minutes.<eos> I know the symptoms.<eos> It's a big deal.<eos> Gusti is not a terrorist.<eos> He moved here to become a stunt man, not to release chemical gas.<eos> Uh-huh. My guess: he's a middleman at best.<eos> He's holding it.<eos> Gonna deliver it to someone.
Not everybody talks in metaphor.<eos> You know what chum is, son?<eos> Sure... blood and guts for riling up gators.<eos> That's right.<eos> So do me a favor.<eos> Chum up that water.<eos> Come on.<eos> Chum it. Chum it.<eos> I want to make a deal first.<eos> We catch a gator, I get to keep it.
It's that new girlfriend of his, Rhonda.<eos> Ever since she came into his life, it's like he's fallen off the face of the earth.<eos> And into Rhonda's mouth.<eos> Mnh. That's as gross as these meat pies.<eos> Sync corrections by dwigt<eos> Quiet down, everybody!<eos> Hey! Hey! Hey!<eos> Come on! The reason I didn't tell you that the cat got loose in the boiler room is because I didn't want everyone to overreact!<eos> But it's a health hazard!<eos> I've got half the staff looking for it.
Dude, I know tons of fun facts.<eos> For example, did you know that all the ants in the world weigh as much as all the humans in the world?<eos> I'm just saying, if they possessed our intelligence and could somehow organize, it'd be a fair fight.<eos> So I'm gonna pick up that couch from that Craigslist guy today.<eos> Can you come with me?<eos> Sorry, boo, I got to get back to the Garden Depot commercial.<eos> I could do it.<eos> My large stature can keep you safe.<eos> I'm a great negotiator, get you those primo prices.<eos> And I can help you carry it home.
Come on, it is a little weird.<eos> So I don't know how to say this, but my brother is a little bit off.<eos> Yeah, he was such a sweet kid, but when he was 15, he had an accident.<eos> His favorite show was Home Improvement.<eos> And it came on, and he heard the... sound, and he got so excited.<eos> And he ran down to the basement to watch, and he slammed his head on the low ceiling.<eos> Poor kid didn't know how tall he had gotten. And, um, he's just never been the same since.<eos> He really loves this couch.<eos> But we don't have a lot of money.<eos> Is there any way we can have it for 200 bucks?
Hey, John.<eos> What's up?<eos> You're kidding.<eos> Cucumber?<eos> Where? The butthole?<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> I'll be there.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Somebody got a cucumber in the butthole.<eos> I have to go and take it out.
She's bringing her friend with her, Sigvaldi.<eos> Do you know him?<eos> Yes, you have to promise you'll be nice to him<eos> Do you promise?<eos> - Guðmundur, over here!<eos> - Now what?<eos> We've hooked some damn thing onto the line<eos> What?<eos> What the hell's that?<eos> - Shall I pull it on board?
Should get you a beater at one of the used lots.<eos> See you when I see you.<eos> No rush.<eos> I'm sorry to bother you at home, but my grandfather wanted you to have this.<eos> Wow. Look at that.<eos> It's a wildcatter's guide.<eos> Wow. Look at this.<eos> It's almost, uh, 60 years old.<eos> The technology has changed, but the same principles apply.<eos> I used to read it at his house when I was a little girl.
So today, we're gonna find out which one of you it is.<eos> That means nobody leaves here until we do.<eos> Thank you all very much.<eos> As soon as you're checked, you're free to go.<eos> Tell me you don't hate this.<eos> It'll be over in a minute.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Has he busted the transmitter?<eos> Don't know.<eos> But if the bug's still on him, they'll find it.
We're running out of ammo!<eos> Alex, there's too many of them!<eos> I'm out!<eos> Lannon, what are you doing?<eos> Alex, Alex. Are you okay?<eos> What did you do?<eos> I've seen this before.<eos> Did we hold the tunnel?<eos> - Did we hold the tunnel?<eos> - You held it.
- I'm sorry, Michael.<eos> - Ask him!<eos> Lucifer believed in a balance, in the scales of all things, and the give and take of life!<eos> He exists, he has a second chance because of me.<eos> That is a debt owed, and I expect it to be paid.<eos> If he does not, I will destroy you and everything in this town.<eos> Ask him!<eos> Welcome, Claire.<eos> Do you have a name?<eos> You won't find it in the Scripture like Michael or Gabriel, but when the first human crawled out of the primordial muck, I had already been alive for an eternity.
What are your orders?<eos> It seems Medea has made her choice.<eos> Hunt her down and kill her.<eos> First her son, now her niece.<eos> It seems the Queen is running out of allies.<eos> There are still those of us who remain loyal.<eos> I count myself chief among them.<eos> But these are troubling times.<eos> Who knows what the future may hold?<eos> What is certain is that men like us will shape it.
I won't.<eos> None of us will know peace until Pasiphae is defeated.<eos> I can help you.<eos> How?<eos> It is the winter solstice.<eos> Pasiphae must travel tonight to the temple of Chthonia at Nemi.<eos> She's sure to be well protected.<eos> On the journey, yes.<eos> But the temple is the seat of Hecate's power.<eos> The goddess guards it jealously.
Perhaps the end is in sight.<eos> I actually believe it might be.<eos> I must leave soon, if I'm to return to the city before the curfew.<eos> I will walk some of the way with you.<eos> Let us hope that soon you will be able to return with me.<eos> The gods willing.<eos> - Take care, my friend.<eos> - And you.<eos> The bait is laid.<eos> Let us hope they take it.
Domestic disturbance.<eos> The Morris Grand Hotel.<eos> You hear that, Provenza?<eos> - Morris Grand.<eos> - Two blocks from Feinman's Deli.<eos> You know, Buzz, the most important decision you have to make on patrol?<eos> Where to eat dinner.<eos> Morris Grand Hotel, here we come.<eos> Hey. Hey, that van is in our space.<eos> Get it out of here.
Well, folks, looks like we're dealing with a runaway bride.<eos> Hey. Uh, what are you guys doing?<eos> Hunting down a killer bride so Buzz won't get the worst possible rating on his first tour of duty, and we can all still go to the Dodger game.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm looking for some technical advice.<eos> Oh? On what?<eos> Breaking into the voicemail on someone's cell phone.<eos> It's a dead person's cell number, and Sharon said I could ask you guys about how to get the passcode for her messages.<eos> Well, most voicemail passcodes use four digits, meaning you only have about 10,000 possible combinations.<eos> So if you start right now, you could probably crack it in six months.
- Congratulations.<eos> - Thank you, Captain.<eos> I hope everyone still feels that way while we're missing the game.<eos> Oh, we are not missing that game.<eos> And as the sellout crowd takes the field for the greatest fireworks display on the West Coast, let's relive one last time that amazing walk-off grand slam.<eos> I tell you, folks, if there was only one night to be in stadium this season, maybe in this decade, maybe this century, tonight was it.<eos> A come-from-behind victory in the bottom of the ninth with two outs, full count, and Adrian Gonzalez hits the ball deep, clearing the bleachers.<eos> Like the birth of America itself... __<eos> Why do you have your uniform with you, sir?<eos> Oh, um, I, uh, texted Patrice a picture of me in it, and she said that when I come over tonight, maybe I should put it on.
I can't eat with chopsticks.<eos> I'm right.<eos> Come on, we'll talk about it.<eos> Yes?<eos> Come on then.<eos> Welcome to the family, Pascal.<eos> - How big is your boat?<eos> - Twelve metres.<eos> If I were you, I'd keep it.<eos> Don't sell it.
- Show me what?<eos> - All of it, all of me.<eos> And if you don't like it after all you've seen...<eos> I'll disappear.<eos> That was a pretty good goodbye to L.A.<eos> I mean, I think we should say goodbye one more time.<eos> We already said goodbye twice.<eos> You better get used to bringing the mail now that I'm leaving.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah. You should go get it.
...makes me all slippery... like a snake.<eos> Great words!<eos> Another tequila!<eos> Do the cat!<eos> He loves milk!<eos> --I own a dairy!<eos> She's got plenty of milk, look at her!<eos> She's so cute!<eos> I'll throw this jewel in the pool!<eos> Whoever finds it, keeps it!
Yeah, that's Darlene.<eos> You are going to modify the dat file put Colby's IP in there.<eos> You do that, you have set in motion the largest revolution the world will ever see.<eos> Sources have confirmed the hacks were in part tied to Colby's terminal.<eos> Sir, step inside the car.<eos> Bon soir, Elliot.<eos> "Give a man a gun and he can rob a bank, but give a man a bank, and he can rob the world."<eos> It's a bit of a silly expression, actually.<eos> A little reductive, but still...<eos> I like it, for the same reason most people hate it, because to me it means that power belongs to the people that take it.
Uh... come on.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> You know he's always been a weirdo, right?<eos> I'm really worried about him.<eos> My Arizona buddy Fred hit me up.<eos> He wants to grab a drink.<eos> Shouldn't take too long.<eos> Okay.<eos> "Deep passions, longing... the two of them had never felt such a love, such closeness, such a connection."<eos> Found a way to do it without...
Oh, that's it?<eos> That's the confession?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, babe, I mean... so do I.<eos> I sleep with other people all the time.<eos> We have an open relationship.<eos> Ex-squeeze me?<eos> Danny, this is the best Italian food I've ever eaten.<eos> Tarun, thank you so much for the sweatshirt.<eos> I love wearing it.
The guy might have been evil, but he was a genius.<eos> $4 billion gone without leaving a trace?<eos> You've got to admit-- that's pretty awesome.<eos> Sounds like you want to keep his awesome work alive.<eos> If you mean find out how he did it, sure.<eos> Having a skill like that-- I could write my own ticket.<eos> So how exactly did Holt get you fired?<eos> He broke into a server at Dunlop Investments and said it was my fault because I'd made them vulnerable, which was crap.<eos> That server?<eos> Dunlop wouldn't let me touch it.

Pelant's money was dirty anyway.<eos> Who was I hurting?<eos> Oh, the judge will explain all that when you're sentenced.<eos> Dr. Brennan is really leaving the Jeffersonian?<eos> That's what I heard.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> It won't be the Jeffersonian without Dr. Brennan here.<eos> Of course it will, Ms. Wick.<eos> The name of this institution has nothing to do with my employment agreement.<eos> And as for this department, it has always been my wish to leave it in the hands of a new, well-trained, brilliant team of forensic anthropologists.
Hey. What's up, Angie?<eos> The money.<eos> The-the drives that Leelah took from Holt helped me to decrypt more of the tape.<eos> I found your money.<eos> I found all of it.<eos> Does anybody know about this yet?<eos> I Th- - I thought you should be the first.<eos> You're brilliant, Angie.<eos> Now get rid of it.<eos> You can do that, right, so that nobody ever finds it?
Hey.<eos> There you go.<eos> There you go.<eos> Feels like a prison shithouse back there.<eos> Joe's finding us someplace else.<eos> You talk to lisa?<eos> I did.<eos> I want this fight. I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I want it.
Okay, guys, let's not get carried away.<eos> - How long until we talk to your friend?<eos> - Wilson?<eos> About an hour.<eos> So we stay hidden until then.<eos> Look, even if he buys our story and we end up on the front page of the paper, that doesn't solve our bigger problem here.<eos> We still need to find a cure for the animals.<eos> How do we do that?<eos> Do you still have Leo Butler's ledger in your bag?<eos> Can I see it?
Okay, it just, it just moved.<eos> It's been still for almost 30 years.<eos> Just recently it started twitching.<eos> I think it's tryin' to find its master.<eos> So we stand a very good chance of ending this thing.<eos> Well, I gotta say boss, I'm feelin' a bunch of nada here.<eos> I mean I had like three bagels for breakfast, so maybe the bread is soaking' everything up?<eos> How 'bout one more cup?<eos> Focus.<eos> The medicine can open your mind, but it can also destroy it.
Nobody likes me.<eos> I suck at everything.<eos> I only got in 'cause of my parents.<eos> Your parents?<eos> They're both agents.<eos> I barely passed my entrance exams.<eos> They had to pull major strings to just get me in, and look what happened.<eos> Whatever Eric was hiding, no one knew about it, not even the FBI.<eos> Just imagine if he'd actually become an agent with that secret hanging over him.<eos> Who knows what he would have done to keep it safe?
You come to Chicago, deep dish, baby. Deep dish.<eos> It's not even a pizza. It's a pie.<eos> You need a knife and fork.<eos> In Brooklyn, you start using a knife and fork, I swear to God, cops will come and arrest you.<eos> I'll take you to Geno's, Malnati's.<eos> - You'll see. I mean... - (metal clanking)<eos> Freeze!<eos> Sanaa?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I forgot a file. I was coming back to get it.
Tell them your story.<eos> I'll say I bought them from a dealer whom I thought was reputable.<eos> I will have committed no crime, but you will have admitted to a felony.<eos> Yeah, I mean, you'll lose a chunk of your collection.<eos> Yes, and you along with it.<eos> Suppose for a moment you did get the job.<eos> Which is highly unlikely.<eos> You wouldn't last a second.<eos> You don't know the first thing about art.<eos> Except how to steal it.
He lost my address when I moved in here.<eos> Hi, girls.<eos> I'm out of sugar, and can one of you read my morning pee stick?<eos> I can't read this little window thing and I lost my cheaters and Oleg's not upstairs.<eos> So you lost both your cheaters.<eos> Yeah, see Max?<eos> That kind of joke is no longer funny now that we're gonna be parents.<eos> So no more that!<eos> It's just not my morning.<eos> Caroline, why don't you read it?
I'm doing my best to get home to you guys.<eos> - 'She won't stop crying.'<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> Yeah, she can probably tell you're upset.<eos> Rump?<eos> It's Rump, isn't it?<eos> That man's wife. She said something.<eos> "Give it to me, tell me I can have it." What did she mean?<eos> Two ways to survive a Quantum Shade.<eos> The Shade's master removes the chronolock... .. or you can give it to someone else.

The way they look at you?<eos> What?<eos> Hey. Wait.<eos> Everyone here is weird around us because of Rigsy.<eos> But not you.<eos> You look at me and the Doctor like you're confused.<eos> Like you're curious.<eos> - I don't know what you mean.<eos> - You do.<eos> You know Rigsy is innocent because you can look into his past and you can see it.
It looks like medical data.<eos> But it can't be.<eos> She's dead -- she isn't breathing.<eos> This thing is a stasis pod.<eos> If you're dead, it's a kind of fancy refrigerator.<eos> But if you're alive... .. it simply keeps you that way.<eos> She's alive?<eos> She's alive.<eos> Well, get her out! Get her out of there!<eos> There must be a way to unlock it - something basic, something simple I'm missing.
You can pass it on, but...<eos> But what?<eos> But...<eos> But you can't cheat it altogether.<eos> Clara, you didn't tell me that!<eos> Give it back to me, now.<eos> She can't.<eos> Clara, I made a contract with the Shade when I put the chronolock on Rigsy.<eos> I promised it a soul and only I can break that contract.<eos> When you took it from him, you changed the terms.
You realise how well that conversation went, right?<eos> You're starting to look, er, a bit...<eos> We need to block every exit from the Cloisters.<eos> Every available man.<eos> I need that place surrounded.<eos> No-one's ever made it back out of the Cloisters.<eos> Not quite no-one.<eos> This way, I'm fairly sure.<eos> According to the stories, there's a secret way out.<eos> If you find it, the Sliders let you go.
I'm the Doctor.<eos> You'd better be, you've got an operation to perform.<eos> Here's the entry wound, just below the hairline.<eos> And... .. there's the projectile.<eos> It should have killed him straight off, but he's very strong.<eos> - That's not a bullet.<eos> - It's a diamond.<eos> - How did it get in there?<eos> - At speed.<eos> Do you recognise it?
- Your actions will not go unpunished!<eos> Here.<eos> - Ow! - I don't suppose you mind if I freshen up.<eos> - Not bad for 200, eh?<eos> - 200?<eos> I have an augmented lifespan.<eos> Long story.<eos> - So, what's the occasion?<eos> - I've got the diamond, now it's time to sell it.<eos> I thought you were returning it to the Halassi?
I'd really rather not.<eos> Bill Clinton was in the White House.<eos> On the radio, Hootie was blowing fish.<eos> And in this house, our little Natey was six.<eos> This is the Christmas that Santa gave Nate his first bike.<eos> And tomorrow, he will break his first bone.<eos> Really, where did you find that?<eos> I found it in the back of the garage.<eos> This is also the same year that you and Santa spent the whole night freezing in the backyard trying to put together that stupid trampoline.<eos> You wanted to test it first, and I caught you when you bounced too high.
I don't think it's that expensive.<eos> It's actually quite reasonable.<eos> Yeah, if you're David Hasselhoff.<eos> He's probably loaded.<eos> "Baywatch" ran for a really long time.<eos> Of course it did.<eos> It was a great show.<eos> Jimmy, I don't want you to worry about money.<eos> I'm not expecting you to buy this place with me.<eos> You can just chip in when you want whenever you can afford it.
We know for a fact that victim number one was bound and gagged, but it doesn't look like number two was.<eos> Windows in both residences were tampered with, so he knows how to get in and out undetected.<eos> Ok, that's impressive because aluminum foil is super crinkly.<eos> I'm sorry, I'm not a profiler, I'm doing my best.<eos> No, it's a fair point.<eos> He snuck up on a tweaker who probably hadn't slept in a couple of days.<eos> M.O. said this guy's good at hunting.<eos> Cause of death?<eos> Cardiac arrest, but Dr. Mertz in the crime lab can't pin down how.<eos> He might hide it under the face paint.

He was emancipated from his dad.<eos> He claimed sexual abuse.<eos> It was never proven.<eos> Sir, how did you know that?<eos> Because 40,000 wouldn't get Taylor a down payment in this neighborhood, but it is a competitive rate for a hit man. Hold up.<eos> Are you saying our Brian Taylor's not so normal because he hired a hit man?<eos> I think all of our victims did.<eos> We need to deliver the profile.<eos> Right.<eos> Sir, uh, to who are we gonna deliver it to?
Uh, well, the Monolith changed hands a lot... Germanic tribes, spent the hundred years' war in France. But before the Napoleon era, it was moved again.<eos> - I lost track of it somewhere in...<eos> - England.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How did you know that?<eos> Because I have seen this word carved into the walls of a castle in Gloucestershire, England, in 1853.<eos> To the plane!<eos> Wh... Am I allowed to say that?<eos> Let's all go to the plane, I guess.<eos> What's the point of a boat if you never take it out of the dock? It's like camping in a living room.
You're messing with me.<eos> All right, great.<eos> Now I'll have to check.<eos> It's late 1800s.<eos> Still got some life to it.<eos> I hear water.<eos> Could be a stream underground, maybe hydroelectric power.<eos> - This looks a lot like it was made to hold...<eos> - The Monolith.<eos> This machine was designed to control the portal, to open and close it at will.
HYDRA's fractured, in pieces.<eos> the right way... by force.<eos> My father so rarely let me see any of his world.<eos> It's your world now.<eos> And when we put these pieces back together, they'll be stronger than the original.<eos> It'll just rattle apart again.<eos> We have to reinforce the connections.<eos> Reinf... look, most of the workings are under the ground.<eos> We just can't tear the castle down.<eos> And actually, we're lucky the room is shaped this way, or the machine might have shaken it apart on top of us.
I can do it.<eos> I can open the portal myself.<eos> Well, turns out we're standing in the middle<eos> - of the world's largest subwoofer.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> If the point of the machine was to resonate the room at a certain frequency, I can do that.<eos> - And you can replicate it?<eos> - Kind of drilled into my brain.<eos> And it could kill you.<eos> How long do you think you can hold it?
The cook.<eos> See him?<eos> Yeah, gotcha.<eos> We gotta keep this on the down low.<eos> Okay, tell you what. Act natural, meet me in the men's room in three minutes.<eos> But I gotta warn you, you're gonna want to leave your husband for me, and I can't let that happen.<eos> Family values.<eos> Okay, toots. See ya in three.<eos> Fuck the book.<eos> I wish we could destroy it.

- What?<eos> - Burned.<eos> Her cover is blown, okay?<eos> He needs to stick tight to Toros in case he tries to follow her.<eos> I didn't go through all this shit for nothing,<eos> Warren, do it now.<eos> Johnny's following Ari to arrest him.<eos> What the...<eos> I need a walkie now.<eos> Give it here.
You loved them.<eos> You loved them a lot if you're like this.<eos> You saw it happen.<eos> That's how this started, right?<eos> It's all happening right in front of your eyes over and over.<eos> Your body's here, but your mind is still there.<eos> There's a door and you want to go through it to get away from it, so you do and it leads you right back to that moment.<eos> And you see that door again and you know it won't work, but, hell, maybe it'll work.<eos> So you step through that door and you're right back in that horrible moment every time.<eos> You still feel it every time.
Then, there was a deathly silence, and it smelled like rotten chicken.<eos> - You OK, girls? - Yeah.<eos> That's when Grandpa's dad,<eos> Rosaire, came out.<eos> Rosaire didn't hesitate. He smacked the raccoon on the head with a shotgun.<eos> Did he die?<eos> Instantly.<eos> He didn't suffer at all.<eos> But that's not it.<eos> Rosaire pulled out a big knife, turned the raccoon around to empty it before stuffing it, and shoved the knife deep in its tooshie!
- Thanks, Îœom!<eos> - Paul?<eos> - No thanks.<eos> I hear you bought a new computer!<eos> Yes, a Îœac G3.<eos> 350 ÎœHz processor, 64 ÎœB of RAÎœ, 1 6 ÎœB of VRAÎœ, 1 0 GB, a FireWire port, 32x CD-ROÎœ, cache bus speed of 1 75 ÎœHz, Rage 1 28 video card, standard 56k modem,<eos> Ethernet and three USB ports.<eos> What about your old computer?<eos> I'm sending it to Africa.<eos> I'll take it off your hands.
Yea.<eos> I'll make you one out of sheepskin.<eos> You can leave Miriam in our pen; she'll be safe there.<eos> You're a cruel one, Toran Prichard.<eos> He's tupping mindless beasts, and I'm the cruel one?<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on there, boys.<eos> I know that look.<eos> You should.<eos> I wear it often.
We will stage the execution in the village square midday tomorrow.<eos> He's your blood.<eos> There must be some... due leniency, a brother's mercy?<eos> You rid me of a mistake influenced by familial guilt.<eos> No kin, no worries.<eos> But of course, you wouldn't understand that.<eos> Being a family man.<eos> And you're the final word of justice here?<eos> As well as chancellor and advisor.<eos> You'll find that nothing passes through this shire without me touching it.

I sure as hell don't trust him.<eos> Have you seen the films?<eos> It's not my job to see them.<eos> I just pass them along.<eos> Then you don't know what they mean.<eos> I just know they help kill Nazis.<eos> Now you give me that goddamn film.<eos> And you get the hell out of my house.<eos> I'm not giving you the film, not anymore.<eos> I'll give it to the man you give it to.
It's me, Obergruppenführer.<eos> Joe.<eos> It's two hours...<eos> I know, sir.<eos> But I've made contact with the Resistance operative.<eos> John.<eos> You hold on, Joe.<eos> Okay, Helen.<eos> So this contact, did he ask for the film?<eos> No, I told him I'd only give it to his superior.
Hurry, you've got to stop him.<eos> Please.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Greetings, loyal subjects.<eos> Honored guests from the Nazi Reich.<eos> And people of the American Territories, or, as they like to say here...<eos> Howdy.<eos> All those who fought in the Great War believed they fought on the side of righteousness, that the world they sought to build would be a better one.<eos> But men are mortal and imperfect.<eos> They see the world as they wish to see it, through the looking glass of their limited perspective.
- Ew.<eos> Please tell me that's not true.<eos> No. I think I might have got a whiff of that shit.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no.<eos> - No, for real.<eos> - I'm just saying.<eos> - The wedding cake is in here.<eos> Yes.<eos> Right?<eos> I'm going to put it out.
But I got you a town car. It should be there any minute.<eos> Wait... you're leaving?<eos> You just got here.<eos> I didn't even get to see you.<eos> I know.<eos> It's crazy.<eos> As is my client.<eos> Look, I just got to get her situated here on the road, and I will be back home.<eos> But, more importantly, how was the show?<eos> Other than no one from my team sticking around long enough to see it... ?
I was just thinking maybe we could, start up with guitar lessons again, you know?<eos> Hang out a little more, like we used to.<eos> Can we talk about this later?<eos> Okay. Yeah, sure.<eos> Okay. Good night.<eos> Maddie!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Why are you out of bed, sweetie?<eos> I can't find my phone.<eos> Stupid Maddie must have taken it again.
Okay. Good night.<eos> Maddie!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Why are you out of bed, sweetie?<eos> I can't find my phone.<eos> Stupid Maddie must have taken it again.<eos> Take it easy, all right? You're not going in there right now.<eos> You don't even need your phone tonight.<eos> It's bedtime.<eos> I'll help you find it in the morning. It's okay.
'Cause I learned from an early age that things aren't as they seem.<eos> Because I want to make sure that what happened to my mom and dad never happens to anybody else.<eos> Because I can only do so much as a cop.<eos> You guys like cops, right?<eos> 'Cause I'm grateful... for the peace, safety, and stability this country offered to my family.<eos> Because...<eos> That's her.<eos> She's your mark.<eos> Because I believe in this country and what it stands for.<eos> And I want to protect it at all costs.
Because unlike you and O'Connor,<eos> I can keep my personal and professional lives separate.<eos> The Bureau needs men who are focused, not men who can't see through the fog of their mid-life crisis.<eos> Let me do my job, okay?<eos> Is there anything I can help with?<eos> ♪ [computer beeping]<eos> All right, all set.<eos> Now, once I install the PairViewer software on Caleb's computer, you will have a mirror of whatever he's looking at.<eos> Okay.<eos> If he sees it, you see it.
That's 10 minutes.<eos> - ♪ California in her rear view ♪ - Well, you're already up?<eos> Can't stop. Won't stop.<eos> What time is it?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Oh, just a little pre-dawn gun test.<eos> I'm exhausted.<eos> You should be, too.<eos> You were up late reading your dad's file again.<eos> I was just going over it one last time before I throw it away.
The closer I was to someone at the Academy, the easier it would have been for them to frame me.<eos> That's why it's so hard to trust anyone right now.<eos> Imagine if a friend lied to you from the first moment they laid eyes on you.<eos> Imagine if they were still lying to you.<eos> And worse, the people who knew you best didn't believe you, no matter what you said.<eos> I'm in a nightmare.<eos> We're streaming to over 12 million people right now.<eos> And if you could say anything to them, what would it be?<eos> I love this country.<eos> And I want to protect it.
You shouldn't be afraid of him.<eos> You should be afraid of what people can do to him.<eos> My son has a...<eos> A good heart.<eos> The kind people take advantage of.<eos> I've had to distance myself from some things that he's done, but only because I know they weren't really him.<eos> They were... people using him to get at us.<eos> The cult?<eos> It caused a lot of pain for our family.<eos> Clayton and I disagreed over how to handle it.
- ...this type of bombing in the future?<eos> WOMAN: Care to comment on rumors the President has requested...<eos> - He's right. - ...additional oversight from Homeland Security?<eos> - Everyone that's helped us<eos> - CLAYTON:<eos> We don't need any additional oversight...<eos> - is either in custody or worse. - ...now that our suspect is nearly in custody.<eos> - The suspect is...<eos> - There's still got to be another way to clear your name.<eos> Even if there was, how am I gonna find it before they find us?
I can't believe I have checks.<eos> Do you think I should sign them all now so they're ready when I need them?<eos> You're scaring me, Sue.<eos> I'll give you your checkbook when you prove you can balance ours.<eos> Hey, there's my big 8th grader.<eos> How was the first day?<eos> It was awesome.<eos> I attended all my classes in the proper order.<eos> And at the afternoon pep rally, I got to go, "'8th grade.' say it a little louder now. '8th grade!<eos> and I didn't think the pizza bag could get any better, but strapping it to aunt Edie's oxygen cart has kicked it up to a whole new level of portability.
What do you know about Sam Bruckner?<eos> That he's bombastic, impossibly egotistical...<eos> How do I get his account?<eos> Make them think they're more important than they are.<eos> My account is worth a lot more than just one statue.<eos> I have more.<eos> That better be a goddamn mirage!<eos> We're here to make money, as we did in Iraq.<eos> The mask is missing.<eos> I'll find it.
They're still in play.<eos> I'm going to take them out to dinner tomorrow night.<eos> That's good to hear.<eos> Let's not let this get away.<eos> I won't.<eos> I'm closing out the paperwork for the Davenport auction, but there's a dealer I can't seem to find.<eos> Joseph Huntzinger in Geneva.<eos> His name is on the bill of sale for the gold crown, but there's no listing or license number.<eos> Not a problem.<eos> I'll track it down for you.
- The Van Gogh? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Well... my guess is that it's from 1888 or '89.<eos> The setting and use of color would indicate his Arles period.<eos> A landscape.<eos> You know, everyone here is very impressed with the way you've applied yourself this last year.<eos> And now that includes me.<eos> Thanks, Dad.<eos> How much do you think you can get for it?<eos> 50,000.<eos> The mask will command much more if ever you can find it.

You should bounce while you can, Tommy.<eos> Look, if I don't get that mask back, people a lot more dangerous than me are going to come for it.<eos> Who's coming?<eos> Your badass art buddies going to come rough us up?<eos> Don't underestimate people with money.<eos> 'Cause they hire guys to do what they can't.<eos> I don't got it no more.<eos> Well, who does?<eos> - Yeah, okay. - A friend.<eos> I may be able to get it back... but it'll cost you.
It's going to be OK.<eos> It's natural to be in shock after such an accident...<eos> You'll be alright.<eos> Can I invite you... for a coffee?<eos> It will do you good.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I have to go home.<eos> I can drink it in less than 15 minutes.
'Cause if not, I'm taking back the walking stick I got her for her birthday.<eos> No, definitely, I know gay when I see it, okay?<eos> I was in prison with Carson Kressley, who's a great guy, and totally changed my sense of fashion.<eos> - Look at that. - Okay, guys.<eos> Let's stop gossiping about this.<eos> If Colette wants to come out, let's let her do it in her own way.<eos> Richie came out during his tumbling routine at the high school talent show.<eos> Brought down the house.<eos> And that is our new 40-digit Wi-Fi password.<eos> For security reasons, I will never repeat it again.
I promised Leo that I'd watch "Dora" with him.<eos> You can come with.<eos> The promos were ambiguous, but I think it's about a grumpy Tortuga.<eos> I've seen that one.<eos> You know, this is my last weekend in New York, Mindy.<eos> We haven't partied once.<eos> I've just been hanging out with Jeremy.<eos> He's taken me to The Frick so many times I don't even laugh at the name anymore.<eos> I'm going to have to go around town and hang up these open house flyers for my apartment.<eos> I'm selling it.
We can go out tomorrow night.<eos> Yes, awesome!<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> It just feels like my head's gonna explode.<eos> But that could be the Stacey.<eos> Hi.<eos> Welcome to the Mercer Street Club.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Hello, I was hoping to hang my open house flyer in your exclusive members-only club.<eos> You know, so that a rich-o might see it.
And then at dinner, he made sure we both got drunk.<eos> He usually has one low carb mocktail and switches to water, and then in the carriage, he conveniently didn't have a condom, but he knew that I would be such a drunk horn ball at that point, I wouldn't even care.<eos> I am glad that carriage driver drove us to the police precinct before we could finish.<eos> I can't believe he tried to trap me.<eos> And destroy our practice.<eos> Yeah, you can't stand for this, Dr. L.<eos> If it were me, I'd sleep with an L.A. Laker to make him jealous, but in your case, you might just have to keep the baby.<eos> - This will not stand.<eos> - This will not stand.<eos> I'm putting my birthday in again and if he erases it, I'll put it right back in!
Stop! He got into my system, and he wants me to put the CD on one of the computers at work.<eos> - Why does he want to do that?<eos> - I don't know, Stella.<eos> He didn't give me a full explanation.<eos> So he's got naked pics of me?<eos> Is that the only thing you're seriously taking away from this conversation?<eos> Hey, babe.<eos> - Hey. - How was your run?<eos> Strange.<eos> Someone dropped their wallet, and I picked it up to give it to them, but then this...
I miss him.<eos> There's no point to that.<eos> But I do.<eos> Then you're just as weak as him.<eos> You're not sad?<eos> Why should I be?<eos> It's a beautiful night.<eos> The weather is nice, and I'm enjoying my cigarette.<eos> The bug forces the software to adapt, evolve into something new because of it.<eos> Work around it or work through it.
God, are you crazy?<eos> It will have no effect!<eos> It'll take down their network for weeks.<eos> They'll recover.<eos> It would still hurt them.<eos> We don't want to hurt them!<eos> We want to kill them!<eos> And neither will happen if we do nothing right now.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Take another step, and I'll do it.
I took it all.<eos> I own your whole world.<eos> I need your word.<eos> When this goes down, Shayla and I go free.<eos> You leave us alone.<eos> Forever.<eos> If anyone tries to hurt us, if I even see one of your guys following me, I leak everything.<eos> - You're saying this knowing...<eos> - You can kill me anytime, yes.<eos> That's why I coded the leak to auto-send every 24 hours unless I continuously disable it.
- And then?<eos> - The plan executes at 9:49.<eos> All the cell doors should open.<eos> Hey, I wanted to ask you about something.<eos> - Oh, yeah, what's that?<eos> Give me a call.<eos> - We'll grab a drink, talk, whatever.<eos> - All right.<eos> The exploit's on his laptop.<eos> Now I need to force-feed it into the jail's network.
Like Cain after Abel, I'll be a fugitive and wanderer on the earth.<eos> Brave fugitive.<eos> Brave wanderer.<eos> Look how you helped me.<eos> That's the kind of bravery I've been talking about.<eos> But now... now I want you to look at Isaac.<eos> Look.<eos> Dead proof.<eos> My operation is over.<eos> So go on, crash it.
But I don't see how you've plowed through these last few weeks, so I want to offer you some time off.<eos> - Just some time to... - I don't need time off.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Uh... uh, one more thing.<eos> Look,<eos> I'm so sorry she was taken away, Elliot, but don't let her death close you off entirely.<eos> Find someone you can be your honest self with, okay?<eos> I remember when I was a kid, I got into web design by ripping off sites I liked.<eos> All you had to do was view source on your browser and there it was, the code.<eos> You could copy-paste it, modify it a little, put your name on it, and like that, it was your site.
I don't wanna hear it.<eos> Every member in this company stood in there, watching the single worst thing that's happened to Allsafe, and where are you, at your cubicle?<eos> Doing what?<eos> Uh, Gideon, I hate to interrupt...<eos> - No, not now, Ollie.<eos> - But Evil Corp's on the phone.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> We're not finished here.<eos> I know.<eos> You thought I didn't put the code in time, but I had to hide it quickly before Gideon saw it.
Aren't they smart enough to make up their own minds about what to put on their bodies?<eos> Isn't the women's movement all about choice?<eos> Bottom line... if girls are dumb enough to wear shirts like that, that's not my problem.<eos> I'm just making a buck off their stupidity.<eos> Right now, I couldn't be prouder.<eos> Wait, did you just record that?<eos> Yep. Sure did.<eos> Vine is gonna love this one.<eos> Okay, just go with the momentum of the bull.<eos> Don't try and fight it.
The Terrigen got out.<eos> When we saw Lincoln in the news and all that stuff about a government task force...<eos> We knew it was bad.<eos> We just didn't know how bad.<eos> The world sees us as a threat.<eos> We need to stick together ... those of us who've been here since before the Outbreak.<eos> Wait, are you the one who sent us that weird e-mail the other day?<eos> - What e-mail?<eos> - The one about finding the rest of our people, bringing them back together.<eos> No. Can you show it to me?
Not a problem.<eos> You know what kills me?<eos> - Smoking?<eos> - No.<eos> What kills me is that you're out here every day doing the same thing. Getting high, drinking beers like there's no tomorrow with Cool Runnings over here.<eos> - That shit ain't funny.<eos> - That was funny.<eos> When what you could be doing is taking responsibility amongst your community.<eos> I've seen the things you can do, Melvin.<eos> It's no secret around here. You got a gift. But you're wasting it.
Our preliminary tests produced some particularly interesting results that may be personal to you.<eos> Lying there in the hospital, I realized something.<eos> I got it all wrong.<eos> I've been a total asshole.<eos> - You on some kind of narcotic, nigger?<eos> - No, I'm being serious.<eos> I got a gift here, man. I gotta start using it.<eos> Use it for the good.<eos> I'm gonna change.<eos> I'm gonna start fighting crime, not committing it.
So, what'd you think?<eos> Am I... crazy?<eos> Be honest.<eos> Prepared piano...<eos> - It's bold.<eos> - Too bold?<eos> There's no such thing.<eos> Is it risky?<eos> Hell, yeah.<eos> But that doesn't mean you shouldn't play it.
Hell, yeah.<eos> But that doesn't mean you shouldn't play it.<eos> Okay, but put yourself in my shoes here.<eos> I'm not exactly in a position to take risks, you know.<eos> Not after they just barely let me back into the program.<eos> I'm for it.<eos> I've never heard anything like it played here.<eos> But of course, I don't have a vote.<eos> What would you do?<eos> I still have time to convert it, you know, back to a traditional piece.
They are not innocent.<eos> So you choose who lives and who dies?<eos> Well, you must be so relieved to be down from that dreadful cross.<eos> I'm doing this for you.<eos> And I do this for you.<eos> Please, Love.<eos> My soul is so heavy.<eos> Let me take this end.<eos> I know the burden of your soul.<eos> I recognize it as my own.
All the animals are cured?<eos> That's a little reductive, but, yeah, that is the hope.<eos> Once we administer the cure...<eos> See, that's my point.<eos> How do you suppose you're gonna administer the cure, huh?<eos> What, a-a garden hose?<eos> We are talking about every critter in the world, right?<eos> Well, what we do here is we take things one step at a time.<eos> So first we need to find a cure.<eos> Then we'll worry about how to deliver it.
Except instead of motorcycles and leather jackets, they have rifles and machetes.<eos> There's no other way.<eos> Course there isn't.<eos> Hey, we sure this is the best plan?<eos> I mean, maybe we should just drive fast, get the hell through here, and not worry about the engine noise.<eos> No.<eos> We should stay quiet.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's Chloe's phone.<eos> Must've left it in my pack.
Uh, we're-we're fine.<eos> We-we found a cub.<eos> Great.<eos> What's that sound?<eos> Where are you?<eos> Uh, we're at a hospital in Harare.<eos> We're-we're actually testing the cure right now.<eos> Wait, where are you?<eos> Washington.<eos> Why are you testing it in a hospital?
- I think that that's what most of do.<eos> We just kind of take for granted...<eos> Those that we have by our sides.<eos> Until all hell breaks loose and then... they're gone.<eos> You don't get a chance to say what...<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - I'm talking about love.<eos> Just talking about love and how, Sometimes, It only comes around once.<eos> And when it does, you got to grab it.<eos> - Yeah? - You got to grab it and hold on to it, Because, you never know.
Yeah. Oh! I could bring that found art documentary I was telling you about.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I'm gonna go get a soda.<eos> Do you want anything?<eos> - Huh? - Is that my phone?<eos> Oh. Yeah. Mine's completely out of juice.<eos> I'm, like, addicted to Clash of Clans.<eos> - Can I have it back? - Yeah.
That... that's fine.<eos> I... I totally trust you.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Um... oh! Oh! I just realized...<eos> I have an early shift tomorrow.<eos> I'm just gonna...<eos> I'm gonna leave the movie here.<eos> You should watch it.
It's that simple?<eos> Trust me, guys don't need a lot of words to make a point.<eos> I don't think you and Josh speak the same dude dialect.<eos> Close enough.<eos> We're buds, he teaches me ASL three times a week,<eos> I know how to talk to him.<eos> A strip club?<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> It's a gentlemen's club.<eos> Call it what you want, it's still degrading.
I am going to do it.<eos> Lily will pick a card.<eos> And then whoever wrote it can read it out loud<eos> - to the rest of the group.<eos> - Bay, if you don't mind?<eos> Hi, everyone.<eos> I'm so sorry for being late.<eos> I just wanted to thank you all for coming out today to support Lily and Toby.<eos> And a special thank you to Bay for pinch-hitting as hostess.<eos> I didn't have time to write out my advice, so I'll just share it quickly. Um...
That scared the shit out of me.<eos> - Hey, guys.<eos> - Mom.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Mom, what are you doing here?<eos> It's not your day.<eos> Yeah, I'm aware.<eos> I just, um, forgot my yoga mat, so I thought I'd...<eos> Mommy's here for a very quick visit.<eos> Come by and pick it up.
Oh.<eos> Turkey meatballs were dry.<eos> I should have cracked an egg.<eos> I knew I should have cracked an egg.<eos> I said to myself, "Shelly... " But you know what?<eos> I didn't want to spend the money.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> You want your coffee?<eos> - What?<eos> - You want me to warm it up?
Well, the inside does, 'cause the crispy skin, I mean... _<eos> And every time I go, I order the same bottle. A 1918 Lafite.<eos> You know how much they charge for that?<eos> Ten thousand American dollars.<eos> Here's the thing. Last time I went, there was a guy sitting next to me.<eos> He saw me walking up to mine, and you know what he said to me?<eos> He says, "'Scuse me, son." Top off my Perrier and get some of that "bread for my wife?"<eos> That piece of shit took me for his busboy.<eos> So your pissed that he didn't know you were just another rich asshole that drinks expensive wine.<eos> I don't just drink it.
Just like that.<eos> - It makes sense.<eos> - It better.<eos> 'Cause here he comes.<eos> What the hell is he doin'?<eos> Oh he knows I'm not stupid. He knows I'm expecting him.<eos> - Where's the tanker?<eos> - It's gotta be close.<eos> - It's his ace.<eos> - Let's go find it and take it.
Some kind of suspension gel?<eos> It keeps them in stasis ... alive, healthy, just asleep.<eos> Strucker.<eos> Where do I find Ward?<eos> I tried to do what Ward wanted.<eos> I tried to kill him.<eos> Professor Garner.<eos> 3x07<eos> - Chaos Theory<eos> Did you just spoil a perfect moment by capturing it?
No one's talking prison.<eos> And, technically, it's a gel matrix.<eos> - They're putting people in stasis!<eos> - Think of it as a medically induced coma, a way to hit the pause button until we find a better solution.<eos> "A better solution." What does that mean?<eos> The ATCU's looking for a cure.<eos> I'm not suggesting that's for everyone, because it's not, but some people might want to ...<eos> - We are not a disease.<eos> - I didn't say that you were.<eos> You can't just expect people to go through that kind of change and immediately have a handle on it.
- Afterlife?<eos> - I'll explain later.<eos> And yet that thimg keeps finding us, killed most of my friends.<eos> Lincoln gave me names.<eos> I checked them against the bodies we could identify.<eos> That's how I knew Lash was using Jiaying's ledger to find us.<eos> - Her ledger?<eos> - She kept a genealogy of Inhumans.<eos> She was the only one allowed to use it, until...<eos> Until S.H.I.E.L.D. recovered it.
I didn't.<eos> I bloody knew it.<eos> - Yeah, I think I've, uh... remember this?<eos> - Yeah, from the castle chamber.<eos> - Okay. Oh, is that the other man?<eos> Well, I'm just gonna say what we're all thinking ...<eos> - he has a hog face.<eos> - He does have a hog face.<eos> Okay. So, look at the logo of the space program he's with.<eos> And if you turn it upside down, they look similar, yeah?
- What T-shirt?<eos> Uh, red with white letters. "Earth is our only planet."<eos> David: Instead of taking my wife's D.N.A., shouldn't you be finding these two bikers from my sister's trial?<eos> We've been rolling up the Fifth Dynasty all night, Mr. Farrell, serving warrants, impounding motorcycles.<eos> We have all of L.A.P.D. patrol on the lookout, sheriff's deputies, FBI agents.<eos> We have an entire floor that is overflowing with Fifth Dynasty gang members.<eos> Eventually, we will find someone who understands it's to their advantage to help us.<eos> What more could they be doing?<eos> I'll tell you what more they could be doing.<eos> They could be tracing Henry's cell phone, except that you took it away from him.
I was never bored for a moment.<eos> Quite right.<eos> We're all utterly uncivilised these days, eh?<eos> My mother has strong views on etiquette.<eos> I don't care how many magazines the man owns, he's boorish.<eos> Mother, you're just being old-fashioned.<eos> What's wrong with that?<eos> Well, as long as he can keep a civil tongue at the dinner table.<eos> We've set a new date for the christening.<eos> Now that father's on the mend, there's no reason to delay it any longer.
What happened?<eos> He was fine, and then out of nowhere, his head...<eos> He's stable.<eos> I'll take an x-ray in the morning and see where we stand, eh?<eos> He was getting better.<eos> The shrapnel in his brain can move at any time.<eos> It doesn't need a trigger.<eos> I can't have this baby.<eos> Because it's not Rene's?<eos> I don't want it.
Gino?<eos> Don't walk away from me!<eos> I'm going into town to pick up parts.<eos> And now you're throwing away good money, instead of swallowing your pride and asking my family for help.<eos> The vines need watering.<eos> I need you to get started on them before it gets too hot.<eos> You said I could work on my novel today!<eos> Is your novel gonna put food on the table?<eos> Keep a roof over our heads?<eos> Well... It could... if I ever had a chance to actually work on it!
Stay away from me!<eos> I know what you're doing.<eos> I know you think I'm crazy.<eos> But he's mine.<eos> I can prove it.<eos> They took him away from me at the hospital because I wasn't married.<eos> I thought he'd have a better life at Ash Park.<eos> But that's no place for my son.<eos> Rose...<eos> The birth certificate, you must have read it....
You know that as well as I do.<eos> Is it true?<eos> As your wife, Rene, only I can sign the consent.<eos> And I won't do it.<eos> You are afraid of me!<eos> I am afraid of me.<eos> When the baby comes, how can I be a father ! ?<eos> I must never be alone with him.<eos> Sarah,<eos> I could sign it.
Not what it looks like.<eos> Is this the new farmhand?<eos> I'm going to keep Stardust here, so that I don't have to keep going back to Ash Park.<eos> You were right, it'll save me an hour a day.<eos> Anna, you're not thinking like a farmer.<eos> Well, forgive me, but that's probably because I haven't been doing it for very long.<eos> Where you going?<eos> Put her in the shed.<eos> The shed's full of hay.<eos> Well, then we'll have to move it.
It's all right.<eos> Come.<eos> Come.<eos> Quiet, you.<eos> - No!<eos> - Quiet!<eos> Quit your struggle, wretch.<eos> You have nothing to live for.<eos> I need your blood more than you do.<eos> - I deserve it.
She... She closes down.<eos> Okay.<eos> Had it been Linnea we'd have been told everything together several times all the details, just everything.<eos> But then it wouldn't have happened.<eos> -I only have wine.<eos> No, it's fine, thank you.<eos> I'm looking forward to reading your book.<eos> -Two seconds, I'll just... 19-10, come in...<eos> Several people in the department still talk about -When you were with us and solved that kidnapping scandal.<eos> I actually take it up in the book.
Can I not just be left alone?<eos> I can't.<eos> Stay home, Dad.<eos> But you have to understand people will start talking.<eos> Indeed, people will start talking?<eos> Hi.<eos> We should just go.<eos> I'll keep this brief.<eos> It would help the investigation if we could get Elisabeth's computer.<eos> -Then I'll get it.
Sammy's not stupid.<eos> He's a smart kid.<eos> Yeah, well, smart kids do stupid things.<eos> What he's doing, what he's done, it's pretty admirable.<eos> Jim, it's not like he stole the keys to my car.<eos> He's going to a war zone.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No, I understand.<eos> But we'll get through this.<eos> Once Jamal releases the money, I'll transfer it to an offshore trust for this guy Khalil.
I guess I'm going back to my room to pack.<eos> So you haven't heard anything?<eos> Well, I-I don't even know if he's made the call yet.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> Every hour is precious.<eos> That sandstorm is going to come and go.<eos> And once it is gone, we have lost our window.<eos> I need a way to reach out to Khalil directly.<eos> I know you have his number.<eos> You need to give it to me.
- Tell me.<eos> - I lied.<eos> About?<eos> I stole something... from the attic.<eos> You lied well.<eos> It's a locked cylinder.<eos> - You lied wisely.<eos> - It needs a code.<eos> - Which you don't know? - No.<eos> Did Alex intend it for you?
It's the smart play.<eos> Whatever they want over there, they'll take one to guide the team back, keep the other one here for insurance.<eos> That's Ward. You can't seriously know that from a bloody heat signature.<eos> It's him.<eos> Wait for me.<eos> Ward: Once you get down there, you establish a perimeter.<eos> Wait for me.<eos> I'm right behind you.<eos> Get on in.<eos> Find it, get to the exit coordinates, we'll turn the portal back on in exactly...
You're the one who wanted this.<eos> I didn't want this.<eos> I feared this. If dominic buys range tech, he's in huge trouble.<eos> And if we tell him that without having a solution, He'll fire us.<eos> That's the thing.<eos> I have a solution. I found a company that has a battery division That we can buy.<eos> Now, we just have to approach them and...<eos> No. Did you not just hear what I said?<eos> We cannot jeopardize his deal.<eos> We won't be jeopardizing it If we can get them to sign a nondisclosure agreement.
He said he felt guilty about it.<eos> So he came to you to continue taking risks Until he finally lost $50 million And then admitted to being guilty.<eos> That is not what she said.<eos> I'm sorry, he just felt guilty.<eos> You want to drop this now, Or do you want us to hand this tape over to the sec?<eos> Dr. Agard, did you want to give the testimony you just gave?<eos> - Of course not.<eos> - And why is that?<eos> Because I care about my clients.<eos> Is it possible that you didn't want to give it Because it's not true?
You see, the bottom line is, is that we were both right When we tried to do this deal with tanaka.<eos> And now that we've got nothing to hide from you, There is nothing to stop us from finding you someone else.<eos> So, instead of standing here kissing my ass, Why don't you get to work doing that?<eos> If you're here to apologize, I'm not interested.<eos> I'm not here to apologize.<eos> I'm here because I need to look at your files.<eos> There really is no end to your arrogance.<eos> I wouldn't ask if this wasn't The only way to keep sam out of prison.<eos> I'm not giving you sam tull's file.<eos> And I'm not asking for it.
No. No. They said no police.<eos> They're gonna kill Theo.<eos> "75 grand or he dies tonight!"<eos> All right, listen up, people.<eos> Idiot pizza guy is a dead end.<eos> We've established that the ransom note was placed in the box along his route and without his knowledge.<eos> Moving on.<eos> The lab results confirm that the DNA extracted from the hair on the note is a match to Theo Davis.<eos> And since proof of life is genuine, we have to assume that the threat is as well.<eos> Now, the Davis family has the cash ready to go, and as per the kidnapper's demand, Mom will carry it to the South Street Seaport.
- without anyone seeing a thing.<eos> - I'll exit here with Bobbi and Hunter.<eos> Hopefully, we can barricade ourselves long enough to open the portal and get Coulson back.<eos> May, you and Daisy take Lincoln and Joey, And you come out here, on the Southeast side.<eos> Let's find our people and get out.<eos> Hey, here's a great idea.<eos> Why don't we go to an alien world and summon a hell beast?<eos> Yeah, that's a brilliant idea.<eos> What could possibly go wrong with that?<eos> - How are you supposed to find it?
There is a feed.<eos> Wireless.<eos> These images are being stored by someone.<eos> Collated.<eos> Nagata, look at this footage!<eos> What's wrong with it?<eos> - What's wrong with it?<eos> - Don't know.<eos> Look, there's one very obvious thing about it.<eos> Do you see it yet?
Did you do this to her?<eos> Dress her up like one of those reality TV tarts?<eos> So upsetting.<eos> It's people like you that are bringing this world into a frightening state of consciousness...<eos> I'm only gonna say this one more time.<eos> - Return Anika's money.<eos> - It's gone.<eos> - All of it?<eos> - Invested.<eos> I can't get it back.

Is that it?<eos> You're one of those crazy chicks?<eos> I'm offering you a job.<eos> - A job?<eos> - A job.<eos> Olivia Pope and associates needs a mouthpiece.<eos> You're good with the press.<eos> You won't just be some corporate spinner.<eos> You'll be one of us.<eos> Look, the job is yours if you want it.
- Perkins told me something different.<eos> Phone's been ringing off the hook since I got here.<eos> - Anybody gonna answer that?<eos> - You have to leave.<eos> - He doesn't know what he's talking about.<eos> - Liv said that we had...<eos> Liv said for me to handle things.<eos> That's what I'm doing.<eos> It's handled.<eos> Everything I said earlier still holds, but I need the cash, and I might as well take it from you guys while you still have it to offer.
That is all you know about me.<eos> If I left this room, you wouldn't even remember I was here, but I could tell you everything you said, the color of your shirt, the part of your hair.<eos> I can look in your eyes and know how you slept the night before.<eos> I know exactly how many times you mispronounced a single word in a debate 17 years ago, and you couldn't tell me my mother's name.<eos> I know why we're sitting here... to fill in this Olivia Pope masterpiece.<eos> I get a job, some job.<eos> You get to keep yours.<eos> We all march forward into glory.<eos> All is forgotten.<eos> That's the deal on the table, and I'm not going to take it.
Wow.<eos> Can you crack it?<eos> Well, here's the thing.<eos> it doesn't do so well in the cold.<eos> Remember what that iceberg did?<eos> Yeah, man. It killed DiCaprio.<eos> Killed everybody.<eos> Did not kill the Old lady. She still throw the jewel into the oceans.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I poured water in the locking mechanism and froze it with nitrogen.
So, who the hell are you?<eos> I'm Ant-Man.<eos> "Ant-Man"?<eos> What?<eos> You haven't heard of me?<eos> No, you wouldn't have heard of me.<eos> You wanna tell me what you want?<eos> I was hoping I could grab a piece of technology.<eos> Just for a few days.<eos> I'm gonna return it.
Gets weaker and weaker until three hours later...<eos> - The light goes out.<eos> - With her husband sleeping it off on the missing sofa.<eos> And his socks covered in Lisa's blood.<eos> Well, this guy certainly celebrated his anniversary in style.<eos> - Oh! - Julio!<eos> - Oh, heads up, sir.<eos> - And you missed the mark again.<eos> Sykes, please grab this dummy.<eos> I'll kill it myself.
And if Mary was in love with her sister's husband, well, that's motive.<eos> Okay, let's invite Mary for a visit and see if she's up to something worse than adultery.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The doctor said, since I had that little dustup with the car, um, let me see, uh, what... Some kind of lining got stretched or snapped... Who knows?<eos> Anyway, resulting in a bit of coag...<eos> Coagulation?<eos> Andy, you have a blood clot?<eos> Uh, little one...<eos> Very small.<eos> They gave me some meds to break it down, but if that doesn't work, I have to get surgery.
Plus, you know how much I'm getting paid?<eos> $25,000 an episode.<eos> Chip's already made $2 million, and he was close to getting $3 million.<eos> Well, if you were so unhappy, why didn't you just quit?<eos> Don't you think I tried?<eos> I have a six-year contract.<eos> I sold a pilot, too.<eos> Great script.<eos> About an autistic child who solves murders.<eos> And the network wouldn't let me out to do it.
I'm looking up previous destinations on their traffic apps.<eos> Oh, great news.<eos> That's wonderful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is that the print report on the victim's car?<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> That was a free-range butcher.<eos> He promised to save a ham for me.<eos> I-I talked him into it.<eos> But I've got to go get it right away.
Each cash house has 35 workers.<eos> That's 35 mouths to feed and twice as many hands touching your cash, and we're stashing millions in these South Florida homes.<eos> I mean, it's just ill-conceived.<eos> We've had no mishaps in the past.<eos> That's not the point.<eos> The point is you want a numbered account.<eos> The bank cuts out the middleman.<eos> This is 100% legitimate, federally insured.<eos> The money passes through a concentration account, so it never registers as a deposit.<eos> And if you like, you know, we can keep it local, or we can ship it overseas.
They'd probably do a fine job.<eos> But only I handle the cash and manage the accounts.<eos> How long until the funds are accessible?<eos> Like any other bank... 24 hours.<eos> I mean, you're handing me millions, right?<eos> It's not gonna count itself.<eos> Listen, it's my understanding...<eos> This numbskull's gonna make it easy for us.<eos> I mean, he literally brings the money to us.<eos> We count it, catalog it, send it to the Federal freakin' Reserve.
Yeah? Come to Daddy.<eos> I'm gonna...<eos> I'm gonna... I'm gonna go for it.<eos> Come on. Okay.<eos> Hey, you don't think I'm too tan, do you?<eos> - No, you're perfect. - Oh.<eos> Vanessa and I worked in the same cell phone store.<eos> I was attracted to her fearless way, just sort of bulldozing through life, and she was attracted to my friend Ethan.<eos> Uh-huh. But, one night, she got her cell phone stolen and I helped her trace it.<eos> Finally got it back at 4:00 a.m. in Temecula, and then we... slept together.
Well, Mahmoud will show her in.<eos> I won't run away.<eos> I'm not a coward.<eos> Neither will you, Mahmoud.<eos> Assemble the chiefs of staff.<eos> I want to hear their plans to defend Asima against the Caliphate.<eos> - Sir. - Mm.<eos> Molly.<eos> A sign of my guilt, like Cain.<eos> I hope I won't bear it for the rest of my life.
I've been promoted faster than anyone else!<eos> You know, I can't deny I tried picturing your reaction.<eos> I seldom have time for such imaginings.<eos> For you, I was curious.<eos> It could've gone any number of ways, and I found all the different versions quite interesting,<eos> I admit, but now... confronted with the reality... I have to say I'm disappointed.<eos> Phillip, please don't do this.<eos> I was on a track.<eos> There was a moment, Tyrell, a point in your recent past, a mistake, a compulsion, decision, something, that led you to this point right now.<eos> My only advice to you is... find that moment, understand it.
Where the hell are you?<eos> You know, it's customary to bring a gift for a housewarming.<eos> Maybe a nice bottle of wine.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> I suppose we could bottle that rage and drink it instead.<eos> You're right...<eos> I'm not the savior. Glad you finally caught up with the rest of us.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> I know the only way to stop the fury is to pay its price.<eos> - Then why aren't you off paying it?
This is too much for her.<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> I can do this. - Not yet, dearie.<eos> First, you must take a price for the magic.<eos> I won't take one to save somebody.<eos> Well, sorry, dearie, but these are the rules.<eos> I didn't make them up.<eos> There has to be a price.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll pay it.

You know where it got me.<eos> All due respect...<eos> I'm not you.<eos> So he just... vanished?<eos> Could it be magic?<eos> Uh, your squire... did he wield such power?<eos> Not that I ever saw.<eos> Well, there's no sign of tampering.<eos> Then he must have lied about having the bean.<eos> Must've hidden it on his person somewhere and used it to escape.
I know the drill.<eos> Zelena, why would Emma do this?<eos> I have no idea!<eos> Are you sure it was her?<eos> Let's just say when the Dark One offers you onion rings...<eos> Aah! ... Don't eat them!<eos> Someone scream for a doctor?<eos> There is an angry baby inside of me.<eos> - Get it out!<eos> - You know, the last time I delivered a baby, you tried to steal it.
Oh, it's simple.<eos> I'm going to show the Dark Swan what dark magic really looks like.<eos> Do you hear Emma pacing around up there?<eos> You're her boy toy.<eos> What do you think she's up to?<eos> I'm no one's toy.<eos> We need to find a way to get rid of these iron shackles before Emma gets back.<eos> Those shackles aren't the problem.<eos> This one is.<eos> When Regina put it back on, she enchanted my wrist, and I can't cut it off.
Perhaps I... dabble with magic.<eos> Good.<eos> 'Cause I need some.<eos> Invaders are attacking from the south.<eos> If I'm to lead the clans to victory over 'em, I'm gonna need some magic.<eos> Something to stop invaders from the south?<eos> Something to ensure the future of my kingdom.<eos> I can help you.<eos> But I must warn you, it won't come cheap.<eos> Whatever your price is, I'll pay it.
Well, he did not stoop... except to get through the door.<eos> But he did come for magic... an enchanted helm, to be exact, one that glistens like the sun.<eos> Merida, I'm afraid that is your father's mark.<eos> Unfortunately, King Fergus died before he could pay me what he owed.<eos> Um, with interest... 10,000 gold sceats.<eos> That much gold would bankrupt the clans three times over.<eos> If you don't have the gold, you could simply return the helm.<eos> I can't return what I don't have.<eos> Then you best find it.<eos> If you don't return it by sundown tomorrow, I'll have no choice but to curse the entire kingdom!
Quiet!<eos> Keep your heads!<eos> Harder than it looks, dear.<eos> If you ever hope to wear that crown, you need to figure out how to do what your father couldn't...<eos> Lead.<eos> Got to be here somewhere.<eos> You won't find the helm here.<eos> I will if you help me look.<eos> Check that sideboard.<eos> No, you won't find it because it's not here.
There it is.<eos> I see you've met me pet.<eos> I'm afraid I won't be as easy to subdue.<eos> We're here for the magic helm,<eos> I need it to save my kingdom.<eos> You're not the only one, dear.<eos> Unfortunately, I don't have what you're looking for.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - If I knew where it was,<eos> I wouldn't have sent someone to fetch it for me.

- It is.<eos> And it's the only way I'll ever get my knights to stand up to Merlin and the Dark One.<eos> No, my dad would never use magic to force people to fight for him.<eos> Aww, apparently, daddy dearest wasn't the great king that you thought he was.<eos> Back off.<eos> We need that helm to stop the witch from cursing this land.<eos> I'm afraid you're gonna have to find some other way to do that.<eos> And who will even notice?<eos> These people are practically animals already.<eos> Even if we wanted to give it to you, we can't.
We heard rumor of magic in these lands, so I landed here in the hopes I could finally complete my sword.<eos> So it's true.<eos> You killed my father.<eos> A knight does what he must on the battlefield.<eos> You're gonna get yourself killed.<eos> She isn't the only one.<eos> This isn't about revenge.<eos> This is about you finding the helm and saving your people.<eos> But he... if you're the one who killed my dad, why don't you have the helm?<eos> I saw you take it off him with my own eyes.
Do you have any idea who you're dealing with?<eos> You don't scare me.<eos> Sleeping powder.<eos> Clever.<eos> She used it on me.<eos> How do you like it now, witch?<eos> Hurry.<eos> It won't last long.<eos> I need that helm to get Excalibur and fulfill my destiny as Camelot's king.<eos> Reach for it, and I will cut you down just like your father.
We couldn't let our queen fall.<eos> After all this... you still want me to be your queen?<eos> You were willing to give up your crown for the good of the kingdom, give up your life to get that helm.<eos> I only ever saw one person make a sacrifice like that, and it was your father.<eos> If you're not fit to lead the clans, no one is.<eos> Presenting Queen Merida of DunBroch, leader of the clans, protector of the highlands, and my daughter.<eos> You're early.<eos> The sun's nearly set.<eos> Unless you want to rule over a kingdom of bears, you better have me helm.<eos> Oh, I have it, but I'm not gonna hand it over to you.

Last year, late season, I started having shoulder trouble.<eos> I didn't tell anybody about it because I knew it would affect me going free-agent.<eos> But the pain got worse.<eos> Turns out, I tore some cartilage.<eos> I needed surgery.<eos> So, last night, you were having an operation?<eos> Minimally invasive, simple.<eos> Should heal in six weeks.<eos> But you can see why I don't want this getting out.<eos> This arm is worth over $100 million, and I'd let you cut it off right now if it meant getting back my little girl.
Well, it wasn't throwaway to him, and he's gonna use it because he's feeling betrayed.<eos> Well, I don't really care what he's feeling because he's the one who had the affair.<eos> You wanted to know the circumstances of our divorce.<eos> Well, that's what they are.<eos> That's why I'm leaving him.<eos> I am sure you wouldn't understand what's it like to experience infidelity.<eos> I would, and I do, but that doesn't change the fact that you made a contract.<eos> What about our other contract?<eos> 20%.<eos> The original agreement supersedes it, and an affair doesn't change that.
I'm standing right here, guys.<eos> - Can I buy you a drink? - Mm-hmm.<eos> If you guys, you know, need anything fixed or saved that no one else seems to be able to do, I'll be right here.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I wanted to tell you how grateful I am.<eos> - You don't need to do that.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I do.<eos> This whole mess has been the hardest thing I've ever gone through.<eos> And I wouldn't have gotten through it without you reminding me what's really important.
I'm starting to perceive things... horrible things.<eos> We have to merge the inner and outer event horizons by separating in the eye of it.<eos> No!<eos> Ronnie died saving me, and I'm so sorry.<eos> No, no, no, get back.<eos> Come here.<eos> Professor Stein, can you hear me?<eos> Everyone secretly thinks they've figured out what their life is gonna be like, but what no one ever considers is that life has its own plans for you, whether you like them or not.<eos> And so you're left with a choice.<eos> You can either embrace the change and move forward, or fight it, and be left behind.
I mean, that's not a decision that can be made lightly.<eos> It took me a long time to figure out this whole hero thing.<eos> Exactly, which is why we need someone who wants to do this.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To get Hewitt back.<eos> We have to try again.<eos> Human DNA?<eos> Yup, definitely not a man-shark.<eos> Not even a land shark, Ma'am.<eos> Well, thanks for testing it for me.
You're never gonna feel the same about anybody else, but you can't let that stop you from exploring something new.<eos> And in happier news, remember Flash Day, the downtown celebration to honor Central City's one and only superhero?<eos> Well, just weeks...<eos> Hewitt, you have those nucleosome results?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> I told you I needed them tonight.<eos> And I'm telling you you'll have them tomorrow.<eos> You know, I know you think you're smarter than everyone here, Hewitt, but I'm sick of you not doing your job, your not showing up.<eos> If I have any more trouble from you, you're done here.<eos> What, you're gonna take the test away and give it to another lab rat of yours?
Hey, I know you don't see yourself here forever.<eos> And if we play our cards right, we can help each other get what we both want.<eos> You sure I still want it?<eos> After what you showed me today, try and convince me otherwise.<eos> Like you said, solid first few days on the job.<eos> See where it takes us.<eos> You know, I think after being handcuffed to a tree, I, uh, I deserve some kind of an explanation.<eos> Once you open the door, Joe, this whole world that Abbie and I are a part of, you can't close it so easily.<eos> You know, whatever my father was after, he wasn't afraid to find it.<eos> It was his life's work, Jenny, and he never got to finish it.

If it were, I'd be drinking with someone a lot prettier than Anthony Kimball.<eos> Then why is Wednesday night permanently blocked out on your calendar?<eos> - Donna. - Harvey.<eos> - You look busy.<eos> - I look busy because I am busy.<eos> Too busy to join me at Del Posto on Wednesday night?<eos> Harvey, we don't need to do that anymore.<eos> Then why did you leave it permanently blocked off on my calendar?<eos> Because I did that a long time ago and when I left your desk I forgot to undo it.<eos> Then why don't we pretend that you forgot to undo it on purpose?
Well, how very fortunate, indeed, then,<eos> Niklaus is on his way right now to put Lucien out of our collective misery.<eos> You have to stop him.<eos> And why would I do that?<eos> Lucien's seer believes there's an object capable of killing you.<eos> I'm well aware.<eos> Well, I don't have it.<eos> I'm quite certain my sister doesn't have it, either.<eos> Logically, then, one must assume that Lucien has it or he knows where it is.<eos> If he dies, none of us will find it, not until some other assassin attempts to use it against you.
- My take, Your Highness?<eos> - The King. What do you think about him?<eos> I have a great deal of respect for His Majesty the King. Officially.<eos> - And unofficially?<eos> - Unofficially...<eos> I miss your father.<eos> You can call me Len.<eos> How about I earn that privilege?<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> I'm wearing it to the opening of Parliament today.
You can call me Len.<eos> How about I earn that privilege?<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> I'm wearing it to the opening of Parliament today.<eos> The Koh-I-Noor?<eos> - And what about the curse?<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> The curse.<eos> "He who owns the diamond will own the world, but will also know its misfortunes.<eos> Only God or a woman can wear it with impunity."
- And what about the curse?<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> The curse.<eos> "He who owns the diamond will own the world, but will also know its misfortunes.<eos> Only God or a woman can wear it with impunity."<eos> Clearly invented by a woman.<eos> - Or God.<eos> - Boring.<eos> Besides, of all the things I'm afraid of, if any, some ancient curse by a bunch of sun-worshipping dum-dums doesn't chart.<eos> Well, to be safe, maybe I should wear it today.
Mom, take Emma back inside.<eos> Big mistake.<eos> Okay. Party's over.<eos> Time to go home.<eos> Don't stay out too late.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I love these sconces so much.<eos> Boss the Ross.<eos> Oh, hey, have you seen my apartment?<eos> 'Cause I can't find it anywhere.
If ye wish to pass, first ye must complete seven unworldly quests,<eos> - each more difficult than the last...<eos> Is he... dead?<eos> He's magic, sweetie.<eos> I'm sure he's fine.<eos> There's no cops in the forest.<eos> We take this to our graves.<eos> [laughing] - What do we do, what do we do?<eos> - Stop thinking, Dipper.<eos> The more wrinkled your brain gets, the more he'll wanna eat it.
Makes you regret turning any vampires in the first place.<eos> Well, the division of labor seems crystal clear... two of them, two of u... us.<eos> "Roses are red.<eos> Lavender is blue.<eos> Come find me before I find you."<eos> I remember her a better poet.<eos> Oh, I wouldn't say that this is lacking in poetry.<eos> She wants us to find her, so let's.<eos> You're so eager, Niklaus.<eos> Last time you even said her name was a thousand years ago when you told me never to speak it again in your presence.
How lovely.<eos> I'd like to thank the Gentilly coven for their generous gift on this day of Fete de Kado.<eos> I apologize.<eos> I need a minute.<eos> Not a fan of goats, huh?<eos> I love goats, but do you know how many of them I've had to sacrifice?<eos> Just once, I'd like to get a gift card.<eos> I mean, I know this is all tradition, but it's just not me, and you know what I really hate?<eos> That choker scarf?<eos> This choker scarf, and I only wore it because Josephine did and I thought that maybe if I were more like her, then... then maybe they would respect me.
- Bow?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - I didn't say good night to my pops.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> You know, I-I got to say good night to my pops while I still can.<eos> How do you say good night to a man you love?<eos> Good lord, Dre.<eos> Your dad is having a routine procedure that has a 95% success rate.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'll say it with a song.
It's up to me to record his life story.<eos> When pops dies, what happens to all his stuff?<eos> They'll probably just throw it all away.<eos> You know our parents are animals.<eos> They can't do that.<eos> - I know.<eos> The '70s are coming back strong.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I get the brown hat.<eos> Not if I get it first.
Aww. Least I can do.<eos> Get some rest, now.<eos> Wow. That was nice.<eos> Yeah, sure was, wasn't it?<eos> Heifer stole my Vicodin!<eos> - Mama!<eos> - What you talking about "mama"?<eos> You tried to steal my damn pudding.<eos> Well, hell, I didn't want that cold chicken.<eos> I'mma eat it.
That guy's rich.<eos> Don't forget to check the reason for your drop-off.<eos> Trust me, Morty, I've heard stories from other Ricks.<eos> Jerrys don't tend to last five minutes off of earth.<eos> This is a totally unregistered cross-temporal asteroid.<eos> Here, they can romp and play with other Jerrys.<eos> He couldn't be safer.<eos> Hey, Morty, hang on to this.<eos> That number's your dad.<eos> If you lose it, we're not gonna be able to get him back.
What the hell happened?<eos> Mr. President, you're gonna want to see this.<eos> I think planet Earth has just been transported.<eos> The head has left and sent its children.<eos> Holy crap!<eos> Oh, dear giant head, we apologize for that discussion.<eos> It will never happen again.<eos> Oh, dear-- Oh, dear giant head...<eos> Sir, we started picking up on a garbled signal.<eos> We're decrypting it now.
You got to hang on tight, you know?<eos> Because she-- she'll-- She bucks pretty hard.<eos> Ooh, boy, what-- Oh, my God, no!<eos> - Teenyverse.<eos> - Teenyverse.<eos> Come on, come on, come on.<eos> Pterodactyl!<eos> Asshole!<eos> When I get out of this teenyverse,<eos> I'm gonna smash it to pieces with you in it.
Right. I know that.<eos> I just think...<eos> This guy's trying to get out of giving away his penis!<eos> [ Crowd shouting ]<eos> Narrator: Today on "how they do it"...<eos> Plumbuses.<eos> Everyone has a plumbus in their home.<eos> First, they take the dinglebop, and they smooth it out with a bunch of schleem.<eos> The schleem is then repurposed for later batches.<eos> They take the dinglebop, and they push it through the grumbo, where the fleeb is rubbed against it.
- Scalpel.<eos> - Nano-doctor.<eos> - Nano-doctor.<eos> Nano-scalpel.<eos> Nano-scalpel.<eos> Okay. We're ready.<eos> Not so fast!<eos> Mr. Smith? What are you doing? Are you insane?<eos> !<eos> I'm a good person, and I demand that you cut off my penis and put it in that man's chest.
Everyone here is under arrest for crimes against the federation.<eos> L'Chaim!<eos> Tammy, what are you doing?<eos> Sit your bird ass down.<eos> Tammy?<eos> Birdperson!<eos> No!<eos> Holy --<eos> Drop the portal gun.<eos> Slide it to the center of the room.
Tenebrae are our biggest enemy.<eos> - The men in black hats.<eos> - We are MIO.<eos> Military Intelligence Other.<eos> We look after the interests of the country in all matters... unmaterial, you might say.<eos> We hunt monsters.<eos> And that's why you've captured me?<eos> We restrained you for your own safety.<eos> You see, Robert, we have a problem.<eos> And we want you to help us solve it.
Exactly what extra measures are you taking to catch this... thing, Sir Marian?<eos> - We're currently trying to recruit a specialist.<eos> - What kind of specialist?<eos> Detective?<eos> A big-game hunter?<eos> One of those psychology chaps?<eos> A specialist.<eos> I still don't know what you want from me.<eos> You have unique abilities, Robert.<eos> We want you to help us find the monster and we want you to help us kill it.
What is that?<eos> - An old perfume bottle of Mother's.<eos> - Yes, but why?<eos> It's an inhaler.<eos> To get your medicine into your system quicker.<eos> And it'll give your arteries the sweet scent of lavender.<eos> - Um... what exactly did you spray me with?<eos> - Some of your medicine.<eos> Only a tiny amount.<eos> - You need to draw it right into your lungs.
You know you are everything that's wrong with the British working classes, Silas.<eos> You are a lazy, work-shy drunk.<eos> Cheers.<eos> - You gotta be kidding me.<eos> - I know. I know it's not ideal.<eos> But we need time and we need a safe place.<eos> Robert did help you when Ginnie had the parasite inside her.<eos> Yeah!<eos> And I thought I was rid of it.<eos> And now he brings it right back here inside the boy.
- Well, it worked on Maggie.<eos> - There's not a thing about this plan what I like.<eos> - Do you have a better one?<eos> - No.<eos> - RAVI:<eos> Robert!<eos> Make an alcohol solution.<eos> But how will we know to get the right dose?<eos> This stuff is powerful.<eos> We need a lab rat to test it on.
- This demon...<eos> - Is the answer to all of Tenebrae's prayers.<eos> We don't need Hyde.<eos> We don't need Dance.<eos> With the power of the Incubus we can bring Lord Trash back... ourselves.<eos> Then why does it feel like I have a mouthful of dust and ashes?<eos> - What has it all been for?<eos> - More power!<eos> What else?<eos> What is the point of power if I can't share it with him?
Our father.<eos> It must sound shallow, but to be able to hold this, even through the plastic, just for a moment; it comforts me.<eos> I gave him this for our twenty-fifth anniversary.<eos> It's engraved, "To my one and only".<eos> Did you notice that?<eos> Yes, ma'am, we did.<eos> What about his medallion?<eos> What kind of medallion?<eos> Small, bronze. On a chain.<eos> He wore it every day.
And recognize me.<eos> But you didn't get a job offer, did you?<eos> He wrote me a big, fat check.<eos> He said, now that your mother is gone, it's gonna be too painful for me to stay in contact.<eos> I'm sorry, Michael.<eos> He thought he could buy me off!<eos> That I would be grateful for these scraps, like she was all those years.<eos> But I'm his son!<eos> I'm worthy more than that.<eos> So I ripped up the check up, and threw it in his face.
And then it was all over.<eos> I don't know, I don't know.<eos> Everything that I thought I wanted. Gone.<eos> All of it.<eos> So you faked the robbery to cover your tracks?<eos> Grabbed his belongings and tossed them a few blocks away?<eos> Yes.<eos> But not everything.<eos> Why was the medallion still in your pocket when we picked you up, Michael?<eos> I helped my mom pick it out.
He's gonna keep coming for me.<eos> He's gonna keep kidnapping people like you, forcing them to do what he wants.<eos> I have to stop him before more people die.<eos> - You can't stop Zoom.<eos> - Yes, I can.<eos> I will, but I need your help.<eos> Zoom wants Doctor Light to send him your new emblem.<eos> Yes.<eos> We need it for bait.<eos> If we can get Doctor Light to take my emblem, throw it through the breach, then Zoom will come to collect my body, and we can trap him.
- Why the hell not?<eos> - I don't know, Grace!<eos> Maybe she wasn't feeling up to facing your judgment.<eos> Why would we be judging her?<eos> There was situation with a boy.<eos> His name is Julian.<eos> The little punk took all her money.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Is she okay?<eos> She's fine and I managed to get it back, but I think there's more to the story.
You can smell the vineyards and the olive trees.<eos> ♪ ♪ [voice distorted] - Grace?<eos> You never went.<eos> Neil knows I did.<eos> He'll tell you.<eos> Grace, come home.<eos> Neil?<eos> Grace?<eos> Neil?<eos> You think I ruined your marriage, well, I may have been a part of saving it.
You work 24-7, you've never taken a sick day.<eos> We know that this job is your whole world.<eos> These are just some of the reasons that we'd like to offer you the position of junior partner.<eos> Laura, you are so kind.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, time is a...<eos> time is a funny thing.<eos> Um...<eos> Sometimes... time... itself tells you that... it's... time to move on to other moments in time.<eos> And when that time arrives, you can't really predict it, you can't explain it, you just have to obey the ticking clock that is destiny.
You know where he lives?<eos> This is gonna be so much fun.<eos> Hey, Denise.<eos> It's me, Nipsey Hussle.<eos> I recently had an eye-opening experience.<eos> I'm calling to apologize for the way I treated you when you danced in my recent music video.<eos> Denise, I'm sorry that I showered you with Cristal.<eos> I didn't even ask if you liked Champagne, and it probably messed up your blow out.<eos> Ashley, I realize now that it wasn't right for me to tell you what to do with that big fat butt.<eos> You can wiggle it, or you could sit it down in a classroom and get that college degree in communications.
She would have died homeless and starving.<eos> A vagrant or a prostitute, along with her unloved offspring.<eos> You call that life?<eos> I call it suffering.<eos> Does Lady Harvey know?<eos> There is much about my work that I keep from her.<eos> Though she would do everything to support you in it.<eos> That is true.<eos> Her heart is filled with love for me.<eos> This, however, will surely break it.
- I feared something like this.<eos> - What's happened?<eos> I'm quite all right, I promise.<eos> I strained myself during an experiment.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Really?<eos> I wanted to give you your wedding gift.<eos> Couldn't it wait till tomorrow?<eos> Why not?<eos> You'll understand when you see it.
You just don't remember yours.<eos> So, keep trying new things. See what your body remembers.<eos> Or make new choices.<eos> The more you make, the less helpless you'll feel.<eos> Even if nothing ever comes back, you can still find yourself.<eos> That one's odd.<eos> - That square on her shoulder.<eos> - Yeah, I was eyeing that too because everything else is so ornate.<eos> - That is opaque.<eos> - If Jane had a tattoo before our unsub drugged her and did the rest, they'd have to cover it up.
Let's just talk about this, okay? Let's not...<eos> You okay?<eos> I'm in.<eos> That's weird.<eos> This computer has been almost completely wiped.<eos> There's just an upload tool and a timer delay.<eos> So what's it gonna upload?<eos> When?<eos> Single video file, in about 4 hours.<eos> So let's see it.
Oh. Do you want to go first or should I?<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> Thank you, so do you.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Nervous, what else?<eos> Darling, the last thing you want to be is nervous.<eos> This job requires confidence, and the ability to put someone at ease.<eos> If you can't do that, we'll have a problem.<eos> Same old story, isn't it?<eos> When a man does it, he's a stud, and when it's a woman, she's a slut.
Find who?<eos> Sakura Iwasaru.<eos> Whoever it was betrayed Randall and Trudy.<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Keep looking.<eos> It would be a big help to us.<eos> I hear there's a new film.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Where'd you hear that?<eos> There's a guy looking for it... an operative from New York.
I didn't expect you.<eos> That puts us even.<eos> I, uh, told them you had resources.<eos> What do you need?<eos> 100,000 yen.<eos> That's a lot of ramen.<eos> Why so much?<eos> To pay the Yakuza.<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> They took the film from the man who was going to sell it to us.
Smith residence.<eos> Oh, hello, Joe.<eos> Yeah, he's... he's right here.<eos> Well?<eos> Uh, good news, I think.<eos> I've made contact with the Resistance here.<eos> What do you mean, you think?<eos> The film's been taken by the Yakuza.<eos> Go on.<eos> They're willing to sell it for 100,000 yen.
So what's the drill?<eos> I'm doing this, not you.<eos> No deal.<eos> It's my cash, my job.<eos> That's non-negotiable.<eos> We'll be waiting right outside.<eos> We keep the money in your coat.<eos> Check it when you go inside the club.<eos> Have yourself a drink.<eos> When you leave, the coat checker hands it back to you with the film inside the lining.
Fuck off.<eos> What are you doing, sir?<eos> I'm calling for my goddamn laundry, if that's okay with you.<eos> Okay, call me the second he starts back for the house.<eos> And don't get too close.<eos> Remember, he's already seen you.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> They couldn't find your laundry, sir.<eos> When they do, they'll forward it to you.
What the hell is that?<eos> That's a call code.<eos> We used them in Baghdad.<eos> Two for this, three for that.<eos> Private and prearranged between asset and base.<eos> She's on the move.<eos> Switch to satellite.<eos> Make sure teams all have contact.<eos> Her cell phone signal just stopped sending.<eos> She's tearing it down.
Maybe you should just accept it.<eos> There's a political consideration as well.<eos> A Russian penetration at this level would be a scandal from which the Agency might never recover.<eos> I'm aware.<eos> It's not like she gets to keep her station here.<eos> No, we send her back to Langley.<eos> Turn the investigation over to counterintelligence.<eos> I want one more shot at her first.<eos> The damage is done, Saul.<eos> We can't change what's happened, but we can contain it.
- Francis, my indiscretion with Condé...<eos> - Truth... became treason when she took it to the Vatican.<eos> And that serious charge in the hands of my mother's enemies... they'd call for her execution.<eos> We need Charles' cooperation, but if he demands to see her...<eos> Catherine will scheme and plot until the day she dies.<eos> Every time someone takes a tray of food to that cell, there is a chance she will bend them to her will, use that opportunity to hatch her revenge.<eos> And after you are gone...<eos> Charles will have the power to see her anyway.<eos> He will come from Catherine, having heard her plea that she was doing everything for the good of France.<eos> We can tell him our side, too, and be sure he doesn't share it.
Will you stop talking?<eos> I'm trying to think about a girl I saw at the gas station.<eos> Welcome to Pillow-World, Bri.<eos> Let me get up and greet you.<eos> There we go.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Oh, my God, Stewie, you're totally drugged out!<eos> You know something?<eos> I have been thinking about how everyone in this family, Brian, does their job.<eos> And they do a pretty good job of it.
And your mom just made me her maid of honor.<eos> Wow. What a day.<eos> And I get to plan the bachelor party.<eos> It's gonna be epic.<eos> I don't think I was supposed to tell you that.<eos> What?<eos> Do you have any idea what kind of trouble<eos> Brad will get into with these boys in charge?<eos> But, Mrs. Wheeler, you just asked me...<eos> Riley, when we do it, it's fun and silly.
Of course they're all dead.<eos> Nice to have something for the kids.<eos> White zombie.<eos> Have you seen this?<eos> I missed that one.<eos> I am not what you would call a hardcore fan of the genre.<eos> Released in 1932.<eos> It is the grandfather of the American zombie film.<eos> Starring Bela Lugosi.<eos> White Zombie introduced the notion that shooting a zombie in the chest would not kill it.
Unlock the door or die!<eos> Okay, Murphy. It's going to be like this all the time?<eos> Fine.<eos> Go.<eos> Prima Donna.<eos> Betrayed.<eos> That's what I'm feeling.<eos> I've been too nice.<eos> And you're too dangerous.<eos> So I have no choice but to drain your blood and freeze it.
Besides, it's disappeared again.<eos> Captain, it is my recommendation that we go to battle stations.<eos> We have plenty of time.<eos> Unless there's something you're not telling us.<eos> This is not widely known, Captain, but the alien ships at Harvest disappeared, then reappeared, much closer.<eos> - An intrasystem jump?<eos> - We believe so, Spartan.<eos> Not possible.<eos> I can tell you that slipstream space simply cannot be navigated that accurately.<eos> You mean we cannot navigate it with that kind of accuracy.
That's right.<eos> We can't beat them with brute force, remember?<eos> Scalpels, surgical precision.<eos> We're small enough, they won't see us coming.<eos> I hope.<eos> Gear up.<eos> Ship's on autopilot.<eos> Course can be tracked via our HUD.<eos> You heard this plan?<eos> And we're still doing it?
Five times I failed.<eos> That's what you get when your background is technology and not biochemistry.<eos> Well, then you are lucky I am here.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> You've been thinking of this as a mechanical problem, not a biomechanical one.<eos> And what does that mean?<eos> When a speedster runs, they consume an extraordinary amount of oxygen, so we just need something to give an extra boost of oxygen during that time.<eos> Like an oxygen generator.<eos> Exactly.<eos> So we just need a chemical that's rich in oxygen that would release it as a nearly pure gas as it decomposes...
It's a living thing.<eos> It's a gift that was given to me.<eos> That drug... you have no idea what it's gonna do.<eos> I'm not going to let another one of your experiments mess with me again, Harrison.<eos> You find someone else to be your guinea pig.<eos> Jay. Caitlin, keep that serum away from Barry.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - To pick up what we need.<eos> Wait.<eos> Jay just said we shouldn't give it to Barry.
I'm gonna have to learn how to use these things.<eos> You'll get the hang of it, Hawkgirl.<eos> Dr. Wells?<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> That's good news.<eos> You will probably be very sore for a little while, though.<eos> Sore is better than dead.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> How are you doing, Garrick?<eos> Your serum's out of my system, and I will never take it again.
I'm sorry, aging, pathetic, has-been rock star.<eos> Did I offend your delicate sensibilities?<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Your brother and that idiot angel, do you know what they've been doing?<eos> I've heard.<eos> Everything?<eos> Enough.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Same as you -- I'm working the case.<eos> I feel the spell just cutting deeper and deeper, and I'm trying to fight it.
He did hear about everything.<eos> That's just like saying it.<eos> Cass you all right, pal?<eos> It's the spell.<eos> We were hoping your angel wiring would fight it off<eos> Or...slow it down at least.<eos> It appears I simply respond differently from humans.<eos> If you were you human, you'd be gone.<eos> With you, it's like it's digging deeper.<eos> You know, Rowena's the only one who can remove it.
I mean, boom, bang, stars, evolution, Taylor Swift.<eos> I'm guessing you'd have done things differently.<eos> I sure will. I've had a lot of time to think it through.<eos> Any...specifics that we have to look forward to?<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> Of course.<eos> Goodies!<eos> I killed her.<eos> Not...quite.<eos> The meat suit was already dead. It was just the soul that was inside it that was keeping it alive.
Um...<eos> It's an honor to be here, especially considering all of the captains that have come before me.<eos> And if I was a poet or a best-selling novelist, then maybe I'd have a better metaphor, but, um, the 12th precinct... she's our home, our haven.<eos> And even if she is beaten down or shot up, she's still special.<eos> Because this is where we get to make a difference, and I am so privileged to be able to do just that with each and every one of you.<eos> So, that being said, stop standing around doing nothing and get back to work.<eos> Guys.<eos> I cracked the phone's encryption.<eos> The shooters received calls from only one number.<eos> - Are you able to trace it?
I love you so much.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I have to go.<eos> I have to figure some things out so that...<eos> I-I have to get my head right. We can have a happily ever after.<eos> Where is this coming from?<eos> Is this because of your A.G. Team?<eos> Is it Bracken?<eos> Why are you giving up on our marriage?<eos> I-I'm trying to save it.
Well, I had an idea.<eos> It's a long shot, but it's worth a try.<eos> To get there, I'll need your help.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> Are you sure you don't have the SCPD waiting for me in the kitchen?<eos> Don't be so paranoid.<eos> You did threaten me with arrest the last time I popped by.<eos> So...<eos> Did you reconsider my advice?<eos> Yes. And I'm still not going to take it.
I got this feeling in my chest.<eos> Like my heart was being squeezed.<eos> I knew something wasn't right.<eos> So I called your school and the nurse said to me that she was just about to call me.<eos> Iris was on her way to the hospital.<eos> When her appendix burst.<eos> And I knew it.<eos> I could feel it, right here.<eos> I knew my kid needed me.<eos> So if I have that feeling as a parent, why didn't I feel it from my son?
- A breach.<eos> That's right.<eos> We sent Grodd away.<eos> We can do the same to these bombs, all of them.<eos> Do you have a drone in your workshop?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Does it fly?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Good.<eos> I'm taking it.

Tell you what. You ask him yourself after he's safe in my car's trunk, hmm?<eos> So anyone up for an old-fashioned hostage swap?<eos> Does agreeing to go mean you putting on pants?<eos> I'll even give you shotgun.<eos> Stefan, voice-over: Valerie was like a fresh breath of air.<eos> I'd been suffocating and hadn't realized it.<eos> Thanks, Nora and Mary Louise.<eos> Real classy.<eos> Stefan? ! How are you on my phone right now?<eos> You must have dropped it when you got threshold-vacuumed out of here yesterday.
Tempting, but I need to figure out exactly how I brought your wife back to the land of the living.<eos> Look.<eos> She's here.<eos> She's ok.<eos> What does it matter now?<eos> Because in less than 24 hours,<eos> I raised two people from the dead with a sketchy spell and something called a Phoenix stone-- no research, no rehearsal time, and no contingency plan-- and now that I have a little breathing room,<eos> I want to figure out what kind of magic<eos> I was dealing with just in case<eos> I opened up pandora's rock, so can I have it back, please?
I'm not so sure about that.<eos> Look.<eos> I know he attacked you, but he could've used that thing on you, and he didn't, and, for what it's worth, he did save me.<eos> And healed me.<eos> A few minutes more, and I would have been dead.<eos> Do I need to remind you that because of your beloved hero,<eos> Tristan is free, Rebekah is lost.<eos> This prophecy threatens to devour us still.<eos> Klaus' blood.<eos> I got it from him a while back, only thing I know that's guaranteed to heal a wolf bite.
Why? Well, the most intimidating people are toothpick guys who work at seafood counters and make people uncomfortable for not knowing about fish.<eos> What's good here?<eos> It's all good.<eos> What's the freshest?<eos> It's all fresh.<eos> How 'bout the halibut? Is it gamey?<eos> Gamey?<eos> I mean, you know, is it fishy?<eos> It's all fish.<eos> Is there a special way to prepare it?

I mean, what would your followers think if they realized you suckled at government's teat?<eos> Look, you have the wrong idea.<eos> No one would have killed Gail for that algorithm.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> And you know that how?<eos> Well... she never changed her password.<eos> I would... check on her sometimes.<eos> We had 11 good years, and I missed her.<eos> Gail was disappointed with the program, obviously, but... well, she was nervous, too.<eos> She wasn't sure at all how her patron would take it.
Well, isn't that a better way to prove to the clans that you're worthy of being their queen?<eos> Afraid that's where you're wrong, missy.<eos> Okay, come on.<eos> See?<eos> I knew you could make it.<eos> I should've known better than to argue with you by now.<eos> Now, what did we come here for?<eos> I told the Dark One you wouldn't be daft enough to seek shelter in your own shop, but she said you wouldn't be able to resist the pull of your magic.<eos> Merida, you... you don't have to do this.<eos> No, I tried to fight it, but I couldn't.
But the dead are dead.<eos> We must mourn them and move on.<eos> Moving on is rarely easy.<eos> Perhaps the next time you visit Alak, I will accompany you.<eos> Whatever you wish, Favi Stahma.<eos> What is it, Andina?<eos> Out with it.<eos> Alak kept his gun from the militia.<eos> There are two bullets left inside, both meant for you... one from Rafe, one from Christie.<eos> He keeps it by the front door.
It keeps you shape-takers docile.<eos> I won't let you.<eos> - Yes, you will.<eos> - No, I mean it.<eos> You'll have to kill me.<eos> No.<eos> Your will to live is much too strong.<eos> - Show me your neck.<eos> - No.<eos> If you don't, I'll snap it.
- Siprani? It's a restaurant?<eos> - I guess so. - Anything else he mentioned about the place?<eos> Uh, yeah, he works there, too.<eos> Great.<eos> What was his job?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> I always thought that it was probably manual labor, 'cause his hands<eos> - are really rough.<eos> - Okay, all right, let's take it back to the name.<eos> Say it just the way Stas said it.
No.<eos> I don't know anything about a fight.<eos> HILDY: What about you?<eos> I didn't see nothing.<eos> We were just dancing.<eos> Of course you were just dancing.<eos> Here, why don't you take this?<eos> Oh, so what, you're giving me your number now?<eos> - Yeah, yeah. - [laughs]<eos> If you remember anything, use it, or if you decide to, uh, help for once.
Works all over the city.<eos> "C" team spotted her catching a bus to Beroun, about 30 k.m. southwest.<eos> Well, what's the holdup?<eos> Call in the S.A.S., take him out.<eos> We need to confirm the general's presence, provide a layout of the building, specifics on security.<eos> We need eyes inside the compound.<eos> How?<eos> Your asset, of course.<eos> One person... becomes many.<eos> - Take it and go and play.
But the computer, it's not where you said, and... and Beslan, he doesn't trust me.<eos> He watches everything, and...<eos> I can't do it.<eos> - Please take me with you.<eos> - Kate...<eos> - Just tell them I tried my best, please! - Listen.<eos> You're still wanted by the French police, Six, the CIA.<eos> They're not gonna call off the dogs till you finish the job.<eos> The computer's in the house.<eos> You just got to find it.
Assume you all heard of the federal judge who was gunned down at midnight in his own home last week.<eos> Heard about it on the news.<eos> This got something to do with that?<eos> Yes, the Japanese gang Eh-Ta-Me has been running operations out of Harrison Prison for years.<eos> My dead CI, member of the gang in question, advised me that the hit on that judge was going down a month ago.<eos> As we were verifying his information, judge was killed.<eos> Information verified.<eos> Same CI handed me these three slips of paper yesterday.<eos> He's part of the chain that illegally transports gang messages out of Harrison.<eos> You can't read this gibberish, only top-level gang leaders are fluent in it.
The jaw bone sends sound waves to your inner ear.<eos> No one will hear but you.<eos> And you know how to implant this, right?<eos> Would you relax?<eos> I went to med school.<eos> Not dental school, though.<eos> Oh. Oh, God.<eos> I tapped into the prison's security cameras, we can see you from here, we can control when the guards see you on their monitors.<eos> We'll be with you the whole time.<eos> You get in, find the code's manual, memorize it, the warden brings you back, 90 minutes tops.
I die?<eos> No.<eos> Almost die.<eos> Toby says you-you just come close to death.<eos> You guys are unbelievable.<eos> You send me in here, and you tell me that you're gonna be with me the entire time, and then my comms get knocked out of my head.<eos> My only contact in here is comatose.<eos> And now you want me to dabble in suicide.<eos> Well, it's not gonna happen.<eos> I won't do it.
Still gathering dust somewhere.<eos> Well, I look forward to it when it is.<eos> I'll let you know.<eos> It's very nice to meet you in person.<eos> Likewise, Lily, a pleasure.<eos> I'm such a cliche.<eos> I almost walked away without my briefcase.<eos> I've changed my mind since we last spoke.<eos> If you'd like to read that paper,<eos> I'd be happy to give it to you.
I've changed my mind since we last spoke.<eos> If you'd like to read that paper,<eos> I'd be happy to give it to you.<eos> You'd be the first.<eos> Yes, please. I'd be honored.<eos> You'll have to ignore the boring bits.<eos> It's a bit of a slog, I think.<eos> I'm sure it's everything but.<eos> Do you know where my office is?<eos> Or can you mail it?
An uprising north of here.<eos> A Saxon slave, he killed his master at a wedding party.<eos> What was the name of the slave?<eos> - Huh?<eos> - You speak English well for a Dane.<eos> - Aah! - His name!<eos> Uhtred.<eos> End it.<eos> End... It.<eos> Say it.
Leofric:<eos> Shield wall!<eos> - Now kill the bastards!<eos> - [All shouting]<eos> [Panting]<eos> Bind them tightly.<eos> If any object, march them into the river!<eos> Get this inside your belly, arseling.<eos> [Sighs]<eos> God knows you deserve it.
- You can't.<eos> You can't.<eos> They're expecting me.<eos> They're expecting cash.<eos> They're not going to care who brings it.<eos> I'll get him out of there.<eos> And then I'm getting out of here, okay?<eos> With or without you.<eos> You appreciate wine, Colonel Wegener?<eos> I'm no connoisseur, Oberstgruppenführer, but I will certainly drink it.

His chest is hardly rising.<eos> All right.<eos> Positive for pericardial fluid.<eos> Plenty of it.<eos> Dr. Leighton, stop.<eos> Put the bag down. Okay?<eos> You're decreasing his ICP by hyperventilating him.<eos> Six breaths a minute, that's all he needs.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Just hold it there.
Cross clamp, please.<eos> Okay, we're cross-clamping it.<eos> It'll divert the blood above the opening to the brain, which needs perfusion the most right now.<eos> No cardiac activity.<eos> Dr. Leighton, can you inject with intracardiac epinephrine, please?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Dr. Pineda, get your hands in here.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah, get your hands in.<eos> Put them around the heart really gently, and you're gonna massage it.
Torsion?<eos> Laura, your ovary is twisted, cutting off the blood flow.<eos> It's called a torsion.<eos> Is it dangerous?<eos> I need to know when the pain started... Exactly when.<eos> Um... I was... I was moving some... some boxes from my basement.<eos> It was around 9:00.<eos> I came straight from there.<eos> An ovary has about six hours it can survive without oxygen.<eos> That means, if we're lucky, we have about three hours to detorse it, or...

Until he gets diagnosed with stage IV lymphoma two years ago.<eos> - Dislocated shoulder, sides south 1.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> We're in code red.<eos> Buckle up.<eos> He froze his sperm before chemo and radiation.<eos> He died last year, and it's all she has left of him.<eos> Christa, I sympathize, but with no one to perform surgery...<eos> That's the thing.<eos> You can do it.
Well wonder what it will cost me.<eos> Excuse me, Madam Secretary.<eos> Madam Secretary.<eos> Do you have a minute?<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> - May I?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> - Great. Okay.<eos> Conrad's all about his new golden boy, and I'm stuck playing second fiddle.<eos> More like they took my fiddle and gave it to Craig Sterling.
Tamir's dead.<eos> - What?<eos> ! - He tried to kill me.<eos> - There was a wreck. - Jesus.<eos> - Are you all right? - Yeah.<eos> Please tell me you got him to talk before he died.<eos> I got his phone.<eos> It's not the same one as we bugged yesterday.<eos> A different burner.<eos> If any of Tamir's people call or text, we can trace it.
My home is in London.<eos> That's where my family live.<eos> My mum, she worries when I don't call her.<eos> Could you bring me a phone?<eos> - A phone?<eos> Can you bring me a phone? - I'm sorry.<eos> Don't go, please.<eos> Just call this number.<eos> You don't have to speak with anyone.<eos> Just call it, please.
- Why me?<eos> Because you are responsible for this.<eos> She took something you gave her because she trusted you, so now you're gonna make this right.<eos> Now put the tube in her mouth!<eos> I need a funnel.<eos> Are you sure you know what you're doing?<eos> It's been years since I found myself in an opium den, but...<eos> - But you've done this before? - Never.<eos> Claude, the funnel.<eos> Hold it steady.
Claude, the funnel.<eos> Hold it steady.<eos> Keep the tube all the way down until I give word.<eos> Narcisse.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Is this supposed to happen?<eos> - I think she's dying!<eos> - Hold it.<eos> Now.<eos> Pull it out now.
At least I thought it was.<eos> Nina really had me fooled.<eos> Don't beat yourself up.<eos> Seems she had everybody fooled.<eos> Finally, the bank sent the security video.<eos> This is the man that made the withdrawals from the ATMs.<eos> Do you recognize him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> God, it's really hard to make out his face.<eos> Can I see it?
_<eos> April, how you been feeling?<eos> Cancery?<eos> Okay, look, you guys know something.<eos> Don't be shy. We're all grown-ups here.<eos> Your counts took a steep dive, April.<eos> Thus the bleeding.<eos> I've been feeling a little off lately.<eos> I hoped it was just stress.<eos> Because our trial isn't working, it's unlikely that staying on it will yield any real results.
It's not that at all, and I'm sorry.<eos> Whatever you wanna do...<eos> I'll be with you every single step of the way.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, I still wanna go to Italy, you know, weigh my options, and we can just decide when I get back.<eos> I'll be waiting here when you do.<eos> Leave if you don't want to see me pee.<eos> You're leaving tomorrow and you don't know where your passport is?<eos> I'm pretty sure it's at my mom's house.<eos> I'll find it.
In that case, I think taking two weeks off is the best thing right now.<eos> Because your emotions are completely ruling you.<eos> Wanting to shut Louis up isn't being ruled by emotions.<eos> It's being human.<eos> And there are other ways you could have tried to do that.<eos> - Such as? - Walking out the door, for one.<eos> I'm not walking out of my own office.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because when someone points a gun at you, you don't turn around and run away.<eos> You take it out of their hand and you point it right back.
Oh, you can abstain all you want, but everyone's gonna know exactly where you stand.<eos> They already know where I stand.<eos> And it's not with you.<eos> You slapped her with a lawsuit?<eos> Did she call you? No, she called Google, and then they called me to tell me they're pulling out of the deal.<eos> - What? - Yeah, they don't want to run the risk this thing gets tied up in litigation, so they're out.<eos> - Mike, I can explain.<eos> - No, you don't have to explain.<eos> You explained the last time we talked.<eos> Excuse me? You've got a problem with Claire, and you're taking it out on this case.
And now you've come for your revenge.<eos> The thought had crossed my mind.<eos> For this lovely piece of hardware,<eos> I think I'll take your hand.<eos> For Milah, your heart.<eos> For filling Emma with the darkness... hmm, I think your head will do quite nicely.<eos> So what are you waiting for?<eos> Get on with it.<eos> I've been waiting centuries for this moment.<eos> And I really want to... savor it.
It's a job offer?<eos> Yes.<eos> Our university needs to do some rebranding.<eos> See, the future is in harvesting from overseas, but overseas doesn't care about college football when they're looking at higher education.<eos> I think you made a mistake and put down one too many zeros.<eos> Garrett, I didn't get our school to the top of our conference in sports and academics by making too many mistakes.<eos> Then this is quite an offer.<eos> I was hoping you'd think that.<eos> Come on, that phone's got to be around here somewhere.<eos> Whoever finds it, rounds are on me!
But we've been pursuing Frank Frink.<eos> The witness said Frank never discharged his weapon.<eos> Then why not arrest and interrogate this man?<eos> Because that is exactly what the Nazis would want us to do.<eos> There'd be war.<eos> A war that currently our Empire cannot win.<eos> Nobody must ever know about this, Sergeant.<eos> But if Frink is gone and we cannot report the capture of the real assassin, how can Tokyo be satisfied?<eos> Whatever sacrifice is necessary.<eos> That is my burden alone, and I shall carry it.
For everything.<eos> You said once to me that I might be a different man if I'd met you sooner.<eos> Please.<eos> Well, I am.<eos> You changed me.<eos> That's why I'm not the guy in this film.<eos> I'm still glad I met you.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I don't believe the film.<eos> I don't believe it.
No, look, just tell all the dudes that Rachel will be here, dressed as a sexy nurse.<eos> Because, look, if Rachel shows up, all the guys will show up.<eos> If all the guys show up, all the girls show up-- it's simple math.<eos> Dude... seriously, is this where you think the keg should go?<eos> I mean, where else would I put it?

The coffee cup. I-I have all of these pieces of a broken coffee cup.<eos> The porcelain could have easily gotten mixed in there.<eos> Dr. Hodgins, go over that piece again here.<eos> Its hue doesn't match the others. SAROYAN:<eos> You're right. And it's got a pointed cusp and single root like a canine.<eos> Bet it was nice and shiny back in the day.<eos> And if it wasn't with the skull, maybe the killer didn't clean it off.<eos> We found your skin cells on the skull that you slammed into Sarah's head.<eos> I touched the thing.<eos> I-I went with her to dig it up.
Here's a copy of my new offer.<eos> It'll be in "The Journal" tomorrow.<eos> There's no way the deal holds up under this price.<eos> And once your client figures that out, your offer falls through.<eos> Well, then lucky for me, my client's Japanese and the dollar just took a dive against the yen.<eos> So my deal will hold up and then some.<eos> You know, I don't give a shit where your client's from.<eos> I don't lose to you.<eos> Yes you do.<eos> Because after this deal, there'll be another one and another one and another one, because you took my firm from me and I'm going to take it right back from you.
And she said that she would do that for me.<eos> And I understand that.<eos> I think it's incredibly sweet of her to be willing to do that for you.<eos> But...<eos> If you could find it in your heart to let my little girl have the wedding that she's always wanted, I am telling you, she'll remember it for the rest of her life.<eos> Again?<eos> You know, I'd really prefer it if I gave you a key so I wouldn't have to wonder how you keep getting in.<eos> And I'd really prefer it if you checked your cell phone every once in a while so that I wouldn't have to keep doing this.<eos> - I have a cell phone?<eos> - You do and if you'd check it, you'd know that Daniel Hardman topped our bid by 20%.
It was decided the country needed a domestic UAV program that could not only surveil targets, but also, in extreme circumstances... take action.<eos> You're telling me we have armed drones flying over American soil.<eos> It's in place as a last resort.<eos> We've never dispensed ordinance domestically.<eos> Until today.<eos> Gibson got control of one of these UAVs, how?<eos> He kidnapped the daughter of one of our avionics specialists, forced him to retrofit a drone with an alternate control card that severed its signal with our satellite, allowing Gibson to take over remotely.<eos> And where is that girl now?<eos> We believe Gibson still has her.<eos> And the drone... can you recover control, locate it?
An FBI file number.<eos> I don't know how I didn't catch it before.<eos> It's heavily redacted, but it appears to have something to do with Saul Guerrero, leader of the Nuestra Sangre gang.<eos> You're listed as the case officer.<eos> Do you remember this file?<eos> I'll take a look.<eos> Later.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Just... all right.<eos> Just let me know, and we'll... got it.
Uh, uh... We can do this.<eos> I can walk you through it.<eos> Uh, first, we're gonna need to prevent as much collateral damage as possible.<eos> Every door and window needs to be shut in the terminal, and the main HVAC system<eos> - needs to be turned off.<eos> - On it.<eos> Next, we're gonna need to "MacGyver"<eos> some sort of containment tent around the bag before it goes off.<eos> We're on it.<eos> Move it this way.
This is your last chance to help yourself.<eos> You wanna breathe fresh air again?<eos> Do you want to see the sun?<eos> !<eos> It's too late for me.<eos> Answer me!<eos> (sobbing)<eos> Answer me!<eos> What... the hell?<eos> You'll never find it.
It's too late for me.<eos> Answer me!<eos> (sobbing)<eos> Answer me!<eos> What... the hell?<eos> You'll never find it.<eos> (Patterson) We just got their blood work back.<eos> They're both dying of acute radiation poisoning.<eos> This whole group has been exposed to an extremely unstable isotope called cesium-137.<eos> Smugglers have been moving cesium out of Abkhazia, selling it to terrorists on the black market.
How could you not think about an MBA?<eos> You know what else?<eos> They've got no women on the board.<eos> They've never had one.<eos> That's gotta change.<eos> You could run this place, Jessamyn.<eos> - I'm not a CEO.<eos> - Yeah, but you can be.<eos> You can have the job you want, you can have a guy that understands you...<eos> You deserve it.
The evac convoy was supposed to leave 30 minutes ago.<eos> Ah. No thanks, fellas.<eos> I've got patients.<eos> Sir, we have specific orders...<eos> You're removing half the doctors from this camp.<eos> I'm staying.<eos> What...?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You gotta be kidding me.<eos> Put the pen to a vacuum for 24 hours, then pull it out, okay?
Okay, clamp coming off.<eos> Aw, damn it!<eos> Dr. Lin.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> At least I'm in the O.R.<eos> 4-0 and needle driver.<eos> Jackson.<eos> Elizabeth Grant here for her final appointment.<eos> Exam room 3.<eos> Oh, and had a cake sent in, I take it.
Well, people. If we weren't already in an apocalypse, this would be a damn obvious sign.<eos> What do you call something worse than an apocalypse?<eos> Because this is it.<eos> Whatever it is.<eos> Swarm.<eos> Horde.<eos> Zunami.<eos> There's no end in sight.<eos> If you're not already west of this thing, you better get moving.<eos> There's no getting through it.

Night, ladies.<eos> You are going to look so banging for the party tomorrow night.<eos> I mean, all this PLUS your gran's earrings?<eos> Damn, girl.<eos> Come with me.<eos> You have to. You're the birthday girl, you get what you want.<eos> Have them set it in the necklace and voila.<eos> But it's not even mine.<eos> It belongs to the people.<eos> Trust me, the people want their princess to wear it for her birthday.
I have security.<eos> Is the Queen's high society birthday party<eos> - still in effect tonight?<eos> - The guest list is ancient.<eos> It's alright.<eos> Some of those old timers can party.<eos> Any royal cougars?<eos> Is that...?<eos> The Crown Jeweler will set it in the necklace for me!<eos> But I talked him into five minutes with it so that I could "plan my outfit."
I'm the King of England, you little bitch.<eos> It is enough.<eos> Do you really think your speech today makes you at all relevant?<eos> You babbled a few cliches to a brood of sentimental failures.<eos> It wasn't about me.<eos> It was about reminding the world how great our last king was.<eos> And how far we've fallen.<eos> Sucks about the cancer.<eos> But let's face it, you've never had any balls anyway.<eos> She keeps it over there.
We have to stop them.<eos> Looks like we might be too late.<eos> [reporter] Now, just moments away from watching Prince Xander take off into the skies.<eos> Cam, call your dad!<eos> Voicemail.<eos> He's gotta be in the control room already.<eos> There's no way I can reach him now.<eos> The hacking device.<eos> If we can find a way into Space Inc., we can stop it from getting on that spacecraft.<eos> I say we destroy it so Black Star won't be able to harm anyone, ever.

In some cases... the process of intelligence gathering has to trample law in order to achieve effective results.<eos> That's why some experts define information gathering as a legal act carried out illegally.<eos> Somewhere we have to find a balance between what the system wants you to do and what you feel is right as an individual.<eos> Time for the Q and A.<eos> If anyone has any questions for Mr Kumar please proceed.<eos> Yeah, Sandeep...<eos> Sir, I was wondering since you're such an accomplished officer of your agency...<eos> What made you quit?<eos> I guess I couldn't find the balance.<eos> Call me if any one of you guys find it.
Okay.<eos> - She's bleeding really, really bad.<eos> - All right.<eos> All right. Focus.<eos> You need to stop the bleeding.<eos> I need you to look for anything you can use.<eos> - Like a tourniquet?<eos> - Yes.<eos> All right. I got it, I got it, I got it. I got it.<eos> Now, wrap it around the leg.
- I will. Yeah. - Okay.<eos> Oh, you know what, you have a little...<eos> - Mom. Mom.<eos> - Right here.<eos> It's okay. I got it.<eos> It's gone now. Gone.<eos> - Okay. Made you a sandwich, so you have...<eos> - Mom, are you kidding?<eos> - No, it's for you.<eos> Just stick it in your pocket
- Mom. Mom.<eos> - Right here.<eos> It's okay. I got it.<eos> It's gone now. Gone.<eos> - Okay. Made you a sandwich, so you have...<eos> - Mom, are you kidding?<eos> - No, it's for you.<eos> Just stick it in your pocket<eos> - so you have it for later.<eos> I don't care if you eat it.
- so you have it for later.<eos> I don't care if you eat it.<eos> - I don't want it.<eos> - I just want you to take it with you.<eos> - I'm not going to.<eos> - Because...<eos> - Just take the sandwich so we can<eos> - all get on with our lives.<eos> - Mom...<eos> There are cranberries in it, and I want you to have it in case you need a snack.
I don't know why...<eos> I don't know why I thought I could save him.<eos> I don't even know why I wanted to.<eos> You were trying to do your job.<eos> Well, my job is to look for signs, and I literally missed every single one.<eos> How bad is it, doctor?<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> Show me.<eos> I really don't think that's a good...<eos> With all due respect, this is my face and I need to see it.
Taylor, you have something called acute myeloid leukemia.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Um, what does...<eos> what does that actually mean?<eos> It means that your bone marrow cells aren't maturing the way that they're supposed to.<eos> So, believe it or not, it's actually lucky that you crashed on your bike.<eos> Yeah, lucky.<eos> Cancer.<eos> Super lucky.<eos> The sooner we know about it, the better chance we have to cure it.
Well, a contact got me Zoric's bloodstained uniform from the Sarajevo Historical Society.<eos> We get the DNA sample, match it-- he faces justice.<eos> As do the 23 other men who are still hiding.<eos> How does catching Zoric catch them?<eos> It's rumored he carries an encrypted electronic ledger containing aliases of the other 23.<eos> Safe houses, bank accounts, contacts for fake passports.<eos> Better move fast, Sonia.<eos> Running a complete genome sequence takes days under ideal circumstances.<eos> And if Zoric suspects he's been made, he'll be on the move again soon.<eos> This only works if we amp up the standard sequencer algorithm and put it in a device that runs that DNA test in seconds.
Stupid bees!<eos> What's he doing?<eos> It appears he's picking flowers.<eos> I'm still thirsty.<eos> Screw you.<eos> Will he taste it?<eos> Ground nightshade petals have no taste, but they have loads of scopolamine, which modulates the nigrostriatal pathways in the brain.<eos> In short, he'll mellow out and be more susceptible to suggestion.<eos> You didn't elude capture for 20 years by being dumb.<eos> You got that ledger stashed away tight, keeping it safe.
One, two, three.<eos> Pulse is dropping.<eos> Okay, then we got to move fast.<eos> To still have a chance to save both of them.<eos> Christa, I need you to start with an abdominal incision beginning at the umbilicus and straight down to the pubic symphysis.<eos> - Whoa! - I need a clean up in aisle 3.<eos> You need to cut through all five layers of the abdominal wall, including the peritoneum.<eos> I've got this.<eos> What is that noise?<eos> Ignore it.
All right, Christa, time to make the vertical incision in the uterus.<eos> Watch the lateral vessels.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Okay. Now, this is gonna happen very quickly.<eos> I want you to reach your hand inside as fast as you can, carefully feel for the baby.<eos> When?<eos> - Have you made the cut yet?<eos> - Yes. - Now!<eos> - Now!<eos> All right, I think I can feel it.
Louis, I need to talk to you for a minute.<eos> About what?<eos> Jack Soloff is calling for a vote to remove me as managing partner today.<eos> What?<eos> Why the hell would he do that after you offered to make him name partner?<eos> Because I didn't offer to make him name partner.<eos> I told him to resign.<eos> What happened to our plan?<eos> It wasn't our plan, Louis.<eos> It was your insane idea, and I was never going to do it.
How you doing, Bobby?<eos> I'll be good as soon as I get this grease off my hands.<eos> Where's the bathroom again?<eos> It's down the hall, Bobby.<eos> You know what?<eos> We don't need an extra plate 'cause I'm not eating.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You're home early.<eos> Your mother made chicken parm.<eos> Well, why don't you eat it?
Oh, and look at how not screwed up it is right now.<eos> You want to know what kind of man I am?<eos> You wanted to see me, Father?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> I was hoping you could explain why we're missing $936 from the collection box.<eos> I can't.<eos> Well, that's odd, because this box was in my desk, and I also found this on my desk.<eos> Michael, the next time you want to send a message, just leave me a note.<eos> The uniform's not a message.<eos> I'm just returning it.
When he told me that I could complete my research by building a gateway to other worlds, I trusted him.<eos> He said this was the way genius happened-- with a little help from a friend.<eos> It seemed that I was on the verge of my greatest achievement.<eos> Until my partner got a glimpse of Bill's true plans.<eos> Bill, you lied to me!<eos> Where does that portal really lead?<eos> ( laughs ) Looks like Mr. Brainiac finally got smart.<eos> Let's just say that when that portal finishes charging up, your dimension is gonna learn how to party, right, guys? ( echoing laughter )<eos> No. I'll stop you.<eos> I'll shut it down!
Ellen and William lose their son and then things go downhill for William.<eos> So did he grab the Wallace baby so they could start all over again with a brand-new child?<eos> I'm going in a different direction.<eos> The drowning of the child ended the relationship.<eos> William and Ellen each took half of the boy's blanket as a memento, a keepsake.<eos> But when William saw it show up in Ellen's art piece, he flipped out.<eos> To him that was crossing the line.<eos> And then he headed straight to Detroit.<eos> To take revenge on her.<eos> But before killing Ellen, he had to destroy the legacy of Morpheus, taint it with murder.
Oh, right, that whole thing too.<eos> I gotta stop her.<eos> Feel that nice long stretch.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Uh... someone reported a dangerous, wet mess in here.<eos> I don't see a wet mess.<eos> Then you're not looking right here.<eos> Go away.<eos> You're interrupting my flow.<eos> Good, now try and hold it.
- The date is getting closer.<eos> - Relax, I'm going fine.<eos> - Your amama?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Amama Juliana.<eos> Hello.<eos> Nice, isn't it?<eos> Amaia.<eos> Don't pet the dog.<eos> You'll spoil it.
Gary, still in his uniform.<eos> And Sarah.<eos> I recognize that charm necklace from the photos her husband gave me.<eos> Her kids' names are engraved on it.<eos> Yeah. We need Forensics down here.<eos> No.<eos> Help me with the panel.<eos> - What?<eos> Why?<eos> - Because we are sealing it back up.
- Containment, now.<eos> We'll call you when she wakes up.<eos> Don't.<eos> She can rot.<eos> First of all, I am very happy that your aunt didn't murder you.<eos> Thanks, Winn.<eos> And second, I got a plan to get Armstrong.<eos> Actually, couldn't be easier.<eos> All I gotta do is plant this little device on Armstrong's computer, and then I'll be able to access, remotely and discreetly, all of his files.<eos> So... So how do we get it on the computer?
But I had no idea that money was fake.<eos> Okay, wait.<eos> So you can identify phony artwork but not currency?<eos> My dear, spotting a bogus van Gogh is one thing;<eos> a bogus Benjamin is a different skill set.<eos> Okay, today we don't care about counterfeit cash, we don't care about parole violations-- we want to know about Crane and what the money was for.<eos> A painting.<eos> Crane called me late last night.<eos> He was trying to unload this very lovely Edward Hopper that I actually had sold him 25 years ago back when I was first starting out.<eos> He offered to sell it to me cheap, like way below what he could get for it at auction.
That's right-- followed by our Vic headed out to this secluded spot with a bag full of money.<eos> The whole thing adds up to just one thing.<eos> Crane was on his way to a ransom drop.<eos> This is a kidnapping.<eos> Jimmy, keep him on ice for me.<eos> You got it, Commander.<eos> All right.<eos> Let me know.<eos> All right, so the burner the kidnapper used had been turned off.<eos> CSU will track it if it powers back up.
One silk handkerchief, one fountain pen, one set of keys, one cell phone.<eos> Sign here.<eos> And this thing has been ringing like crazy.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Go for Gerard.<eos> You should really answer your phone, Mr. Hirsch.<eos> Who is this?<eos> Shut up and listen to me very carefully.<eos> So he wants the painting?<eos> Yes, and he threatened to kill this Laura Ioane woman and come after me if I don't hand it over.
My question is how did he even know about the Hopper?<eos> Well, he probably had Crane under surveillance from the moment he put this thing in motion.<eos> If that's the case, last night when you went to Crane's house he would have you leave with the painting.<eos> Well, he said he would call back with a time and place for the drop.<eos> Well, that's perfect.<eos> When he does, you keep him talking, we'll run a trace.<eos> What we have to do, though, is get the painting back.<eos> So where is it now?<eos> Actually, I don't have it anymore. I flipped it to a collector this morning.<eos> Then get it back.
Actually, I don't have it anymore. I flipped it to a collector this morning.<eos> Then get it back.<eos> That might prove difficult.<eos> This particular collector is not what I would call a friend of law enforcement.<eos> In fact, he's a Russian crime lord.<eos> I never heard of him.<eos> Well, if you had, he wouldn't be doing his job very well.<eos> Well, crime lord or not, we need to get that painting.<eos> We could try appealing to his better angels, but I think that's a nonstarter.<eos> Or we could just take it back.
I never heard of him.<eos> Well, if you had, he wouldn't be doing his job very well.<eos> Well, crime lord or not, we need to get that painting.<eos> We could try appealing to his better angels, but I think that's a nonstarter.<eos> Or we could just take it back.<eos> That's a much better plan.<eos> Assuming the painting is still on the island.<eos> What?<eos> Why wouldn't it be?<eos> Because there's a good chance that Kozlov's people were planning to smuggle it out today.
We're live scanning the crowd right now.<eos> Nobody moves until the drop is done and the kidnapper has the package in hand.<eos> Where is this guy?<eos> Hello?<eos> Cross the street.<eos> Okay, Hirsch is on the move.<eos> Copy that.<eos> He's crossing Kalakaua at Ohua.<eos> Kidnapper's got a signal bouncer on his phone.<eos> We can't trace it.
It's like changing a roll of toilet tissue.<eos> You don't ignore it.<eos> Oh, you're not gonna let me forget that, are you?<eos> I didn't know where you kept your extra rolls.<eos> You could have looked.<eos> How hard was that?<eos> Um... what are you doing?<eos> I am changing the toner.<eos> It's still not working.<eos> Yeah, that's because I just changed it, so, you just put the old toner back in.
It's still not working.<eos> Yeah, that's because I just changed it, so, you just put the old toner back in.<eos> Huh.<eos> That's kind of like taking the new toilet paper off the roll and replacing it with used toilet paper.<eos> I'm just saying I've never done anything like that.<eos> Oh, problem with the copier?<eos> Did you try, uh, changing the toner?<eos> Okay.<eos> We, uh, got a case.<eos> I'll switch it back. Thank you.
What?<eos> - Nothing, it's just that, um... someone's gonna have to actually install this range extender.<eos> There's nothing wrong with the Wi-Fi.<eos> Eric's disrupting the signal.<eos> But they don't know that.<eos> And I just figured 'cause of your whole, you know, "do what needs to get done" thing, that maybe you might want a little redemption from the whole toner debacle today.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You sure?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> You want to install it, install it.
Eric say that again?<eos> I knew I smelled gasoline.<eos> She was sent here to torch this place.<eos> Guys, did you hear me?<eos> She is not a real cleaning woman.<eos> Thanks, Eric.<eos> Good to know.<eos> This is so good, Catalina!<eos> It's just wonderful.<eos> Now that you've built your masterpiece, I want you to imagine destroying it!
Make yourself at home.<eos> Yeah, thanks again.<eos> Okay. Sweet dreams.<eos> Christy. Don't you have work to do?<eos> Hmm? On your computer, upstairs?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> I, uh, I go to college, so I have a paper to write.<eos> And print.<eos> Yes, and print.<eos> Can't turn it in unless you print it.
I, uh, I go to college, so I have a paper to write.<eos> And print.<eos> Yes, and print.<eos> Can't turn it in unless you print it.<eos> I am, uh, not in college, so, uh, I like to watch TV.<eos> Okay. Sweet dreams.<eos> Good night.<eos> Aren't you afraid I'm gonna steal your purse?<eos> Oh... don't be silly.<eos> Just, uh, just put it in my mouth.
What are you going? There's a very specific protocol on this sub.<eos> Self-destruct?<eos> If our enemies capture this sub, its technology could be used to kill thousands of Americans or our allies.<eos> In the event that the craft is disabled, the last officer on board has to initiate the sequence.<eos> But the Navy's on their way.<eos> They'll recover the ship.<eos> Yeah, but what if they can't?<eos> What if they run into logistical problems, which is very possible?<eos> What if whoever planted the device that we came here for tries to get it as soon as we leave?<eos> That's why the protocol's in place, and that's why we have to follow it.
Sounds like you guys could use an influx of cash.<eos> Who's ready to work?<eos> Organized crime members in Kazakhstan have obtained a Soviet 1970s-era nuke.<eos> They are preparing to sell it tomorrow night to the highest bidder.<eos> Starting price-- 20 million.<eos> And none of the potential buyers are our friends.<eos> Intel tracked the missile to an abandoned Soviet naval base on the Ishim River, containing 47 warehouses on 100 hectares.<eos> It's deserted, except for the occasional security patrol, but those guys are unarmed private contractors.<eos> We have no idea where the missile is on this base.<eos> So, you want the guys in the flea-infested garage to find it.
Can we sneak across the border?<eos> This isn't the U.S. and Mexico. We'd get caught.<eos> There is dense forest in the country's interior.<eos> Maybe you could hide out there while Cooper sets up an extraction in a week or so.<eos> Maybe wait for things to calm down a bit?<eos> Hey, chief, where would one find a plunger?<eos> Not now.<eos> - We're not running, we're not hiding.<eos> And even if we could get out of here, that nuke sale would till go through, and the buyer ain't gonna be a decorator buying an accent piece.<eos> We might want to get out of here, but that missile-- we're gonna see it again, guaranteed, when it hits Atlanta, Chicago or L.A.
I thought mosquitoes went extinct.<eos> Did Dash come to you again?<eos> Swung by for a visit.<eos> Find out everything you can about this detective.<eos> - Already on it.<eos> - And when I say<eos> "find out," I don't mean s...<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> You go to your church, Agatha, I'll go to mine.<eos> Are you still seeing it?
Thank you.<eos> Continuous.<eos> Mostly user ratings, uh...<eos> - micropayments. - Pretty nervous, even for a job interview.<eos> What's going to happen when he sees blood?<eos> Well, uh, we're placing candidates with our detectives in the field immediately.<eos> It's a trial period so that we can test compatibility.<eos> It does not mean you have the job.<eos> I'm not sure I want it.<eos> Of course, I do. Uh... w-want it.
I don't got to talk to you about any of this.<eos> Unless you're charging me with something.<eos> The arguments just got worse and worse.<eos> And it didn't help that Abby was so much younger than Denise and maybe... got a little more attention when it came to, you know,<eos> - sleeping arrangements.<eos> - There was a little pushing and shoving between her and Denise toward the end.<eos> I think that was the last straw.<eos> The next day, she just... left.<eos> She'd been trying to get that down payment back ever since.<eos> But giving it to her would've meant selling the house.
Amy broke up with Sheldon, she got her ears pierced and she made us eat penis cookies!<eos> Hang on.<eos> She wants to talk to you.<eos> I don't think the lever's working.<eos> What makes you say that?<eos> There's gotta be something else we could try.<eos> If this was Star Trek, we could use a phaser to blast it off.<eos> No, it's too broad of a beam.<eos> You'd need something more precise, like Superman's heat vision.<eos> Ooh, the Green Lantern's ring could make a big green hand that unscrews it.
The detective on the case thinks someone was sending a message.<eos> And this is the guy who sold you and Major Utopium at the club?<eos> I buy drugs one time, purely for research purposes, and this is what happens.<eos> How bad must my karma be?<eos> Ever think it was his karma?<eos> Hey, I haven't been able to reach you.<eos> Oh. Someone ran over my phone.<eos> I found a shop in Tacoma that carries our elusive costume.<eos> Got a name for the girl who rented it the night of the frat party.<eos> Apparently, she rented it for her boyfriend.

Someone ran over my phone.<eos> I found a shop in Tacoma that carries our elusive costume.<eos> Got a name for the girl who rented it the night of the frat party.<eos> Apparently, she rented it for her boyfriend.<eos> They're on their way in.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Captain Wozzles is awesome.<eos> Um, why do you want to talk about the costume?<eos> I swear, it wasn't damaged when we returned it.
- It's perfectly legal.<eos> - What are you thinking, Junior?<eos> We go to Dawn and Trevor and see if they want to sue?<eos> Wait, I-I don't want to sue.<eos> Oh, oh, I don't want to sue, he doesn't want to sue, nobody wants to sue, but I think the question we're facing is don't we have to sue?<eos> - Not at all.<eos> - Yeah, we do.<eos> We would be representing love.<eos> And their constitutional right to have it.<eos> And to share it with whomever and wherever.
- Listen very carefully.<eos> You've got a hole in your abdomen, and if you keep moving, it's gonna reopen and blood is gonna gush outta you like Christmas.<eos> So stay still.<eos> Why haven't you left yet?<eos> Because the Omec are hunting everyone in town and I am up to my elbows in blood, missy.<eos> You almost died.<eos> Doc saved you.<eos> Saved all these people.<eos> Nobody's life is important right now.<eos> Nothing's important but getting on that ship and destroying it.
We've noticed.<eos> ♪<eos> Okay, you know that cool kid in junior high school who somehow had, like, three black belts already?<eos> No, not me.<eos> Him.<eos> Pretty sure that kid grew up to be Casey Rooks.<eos> And if anyone can make me a badass, it's him.<eos> Don't get into a fight.<eos> Okay.<eos> If you do get into a fight, take it to the ground, get on top of the guy, isolate one of his limbs, and make it bend the wrong way
Someone's had a lot of treats this morning, hasn't someone? Yes, someone has.<eos> You have a Craig Sterling problem,<eos> - and we need to talk about it.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> 'Cause if you don't get this under control, you are going to be boxed out of POTUS's inner circle.<eos> Is that even geometrically possible?<eos> And when that happens, you will leave office with no legacy, which, in this town, is worse than being dead.<eos> Have I told you how sad I feel for literally everyone who lives here?<eos> It's getting around that you are on the outs with the White House.<eos> Because Craig is leaking it.
The shows are popular with those folks, and when they're over, the Kremlin airs a "news hour."<eos> Otherwise known as state-controlled propaganda.<eos> Exactly.<eos> False reports that ethnic Russians are being murdered in the west.<eos> Estonian nuclear plants are melting down.<eos> That Ukraine is secretly planning to invade Russia.<eos> Without any truth to counter it, people believe the lies.<eos> And every day, U.S. security interests in Europe are undermined.<eos> So what's your battle plan?<eos> Public Diplomacy thinks that if we could license a popular American program, we could air it opposite the Russian game shows.
Afeni Rahim is in the air, accompanied by federal marshals, the senate just approved lifting the embargo, and the president will be signing the bill<eos> - as you're giving your speech.<eos> - We actually pulled it off.<eos> Excellent work.<eos> And no surprises coming<eos> - out of left field.<eos> - There is one.<eos> Madam Secretary, I'd like you to meet Staff Sergeant Bill Thomas and PFC Joseph Hoffman.<eos> These were the two Marines that lowered the American flag when the embassy closed in 1961.<eos> I thought they should be here today when we raise it again.
What you never told anyone.<eos> I heard you, too.<eos> It's been a long day.<eos> I ran the search you asked for.<eos> This is all I could find under "Photonic Containment."<eos> This is good, Charles.<eos> Let's talk money.<eos> I want my money.<eos> The rest of your cash is under the table.<eos> You can take it and leave.
3, 2, 1...<eos> Fire!<eos> Target 2 on the ground.<eos> Don't!<eos> Bloody hell!<eos> Hello, can I help you?<eos> The painting in your window. Take it down.<eos> - You want to look at it?
- Yeah.<eos> They killed thousands, like this.<eos> Who was in charge of this branch?<eos> You know the answer.<eos> Metis is working on psychoactive drugs for military purposes.<eos> A booming market. A general I interviewed told me.<eos> - What was his name?<eos> - Garsac.<eos> According to him, the human brain will outdo anything.<eos> Control it, and you become master of the universe.
Put me through to senior management.<eos> OK, I'll wait.<eos> A journalist told me that Metis was developing psychoactive drugs.<eos> Maybe they've been doing tests on you, Mathias.<eos> It's Chaplain's number.<eos> I had a call, last July, from a withheld number.<eos> This is the date, the time, and my number at the time.<eos> Can you identify it?<eos> The bottom one is my new number.<eos> Can you memorise it?
Why, you ungrateful bastard!<eos> Get off me!<eos> Get him off!<eos> Get off!<eos> You're gonna pay for this, Dean!<eos> I swear to God, you're gonna pay!<eos> Stop it!<eos> What's the verdict?<eos> Um, didn't get much.<eos> You should have it on screen now.
He's prone to exaggerate.<eos> And he likes to intimidate people.<eos> Perhaps that's why the people look to me for inspiration and hope.<eos> Hope?<eos> Yes, Mr. Murphy.<eos> Hope.<eos> You see, like me, you too survived for a reason.<eos> Please. This way.<eos> Your blood is the cure, is it not?<eos> What good is a cure if you can't get it to the people?
Consider it done.<eos> Now, I'm no genius, but you don't have to be a genius to figure out who the dog is.<eos> Duclair put the hit on you.<eos> And your boy was willing to go along with it.<eos> That bomb at your house was meant for you.<eos> You're running out of friends real fast.<eos> You want to stay ative, give us the name.<eos> You knew all along?<eos> I got an itch on the end of my nose.<eos> Can one of you guys get it for me?
As long as he keeps those shoes on, we should be able to track him wherever he goes.<eos> Danny, that burner phone that our poet used to contact Steve last night just came back online.<eos> We should have an exact location in a few seconds.<eos> Got a SWAT team that's ready to roll as soon as we give 'em a location.<eos> All right, I'll stay on with you.<eos> Danny, we got to go.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Where is he?<eos> Right outside the palace.<eos> Don't touch it!
Yeah, let's get you two some medals, huh?<eos> Way to go.<eos> We did have a good case, sir, but Jane Cooley is a damn good defense attorney--<eos> I get it.<eos> No... Taking down Grazioso is a priority for this office.<eos> Guess we'll talk about that later.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> Yeah, Jimmy, come on in.<eos> You heard Grazioso was acquitted in his racketeering trial?<eos> It's easier to catch a snake than kill it.
According to the case folder, the original search covered a two-block radius.<eos> This morning, me and Jimmy extended the area search another two blocks in the direction the suspect fled.<eos> And looky what we found.<eos> .38 caliber... same caliber gun that killed Ronald Green.<eos> Where'd you find this?<eos> Roof of a single story warehouse that's been abandoned for years and wedged under a pile of asphalt shingles.<eos> Blended right in.<eos> Well, there's no guarantee that it's the murder weapon.<eos> No, but dreaming big?<eos> If we can link it to Grazioso, you could charge him with murder.
Sir, just stay back.<eos> Please, don't hurt her-- please, she doesn't know what she's doing, Please!<eos> Hey, hey, what's going on?<eos> Domestic disturbance, she stabbed her father.<eos> You don't understand-- they're coming for me.<eos> Uh, hey, hey, don't shoot, okay?<eos> We know this girl, we know her.<eos> Then tell her to put the knife down.<eos> She's an EDP.<eos> I don't care if she's freaking E.T., she needs to put it down.
Oh, as Bautista then round the outside...<eos> NARRATOR: Colin Edwards and Valentino Rossi were just behind Simoncelli.<eos> I touch him but I was behind Colin.<eos> I see him just at the last moment.<eos> I saw him crash.<eos> I was looking up in the corner and he's crashed.<eos> I'm gonna duck under and get a good drive to the next corner.<eos> The next thing you know, he was right in front of us.<eos> He lost the front.<eos> He was just fighting to get it back.
Ready to jump?<eos> Take position.<eos> Arms spread.<eos> 3, 2, 1...<eos> How was the Adrets peak?<eos> You should see it at sunrise.
Something did.<eos> I realized you were wasting my time.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You're not really worried about a wind farm affecting the view from your hotel in Costa Rica.<eos> You feigned interest in compromise so as not to arouse suspicion.<eos> Once you and I simply failed to reach a deal, no one would ever ask the real reason you wanted the farm to go away.<eos> Do the words "mono titi" mean anything to you?<eos> I'm afraid they do not.<eos> Well, it's what the Costa Ricans call this animal.<eos> You might know it better as the black crowned squirrel monkey.
He spares no expense for his lady.<eos> Since we're talking about Giorgio Baldi's, that's the kind of place that you spring for when you're about to freaking propose.<eos> Don't answer that question.<eos> You didn't ask a question.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Well, this just got weird.<eos> The topic of conversation was best meals ever.<eos> White truffles it is.<eos> High-priced plates of fungi.<eos> That's really interesting, actually, because I think it was you and I over a plate of nachos at the Clippers-Spurs game when you told me that a meal is all about the person you're sharing it with.
Yeah, this is an auto repair shop.<eos> What's here that shouldn't be?<eos> What isn't here that should be? Mm-hmm.<eos> No cars, no trucks, no motorcycles.<eos> No customers.<eos> I think they were working on something that was parked right here-- something big, judging by those tires.<eos> Probably a cargo truck. Mm.<eos> Eric said he couldn't find a surveillance camera angle on the front of the building.<eos> So, if they drove a cargo truck out of here, we would have no way to identify it.<eos> No way to track it.

Yeah.<eos> Now, if this is what they were doing to that cargo truck...<eos> Maybe we can identify and track it.
I think you need some help.<eos> Get away from me.<eos> Put your feet together.<eos> My feet are together. I don't...<eos> Oh, just breathe through it.<eos> Yep. Just push your hips down.<eos> I don't think man is supposed to bend like that.<eos> You can go further.<eos> No, I think I just heard something snap.<eos> Okay, if there's a safe word in yoga, I'd like to know it, 'cause at this point I'd like to say it.
(indistinct conversations)<eos> Zahra!<eos> (speaks indistinctly)<eos> We did a good thing today.<eos> Yeah, and, you, Kensi, you were amazing with those girls.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Crazy.<eos> We would've never found out about this case if it wasn't for that note.<eos> KENSI:<eos> And Zahra only wrote Badr Al Din's name because she forgot how to pronounce it.
I would expect nothing less from a man of your talents.<eos> Do people around here know how sharp you are?<eos> 'Cause I could help you with that, man.<eos> They told me you'd try to get into my head.<eos> That's a cynical way of putting it.<eos> This could be the beginning of a very mutually beneficial relationship...<eos> You think this is a good detail?<eos> Babysitting you?<eos> You think that's why I went to Quantico?<eos> I took this job because they promised that if I do it for a year,
You're so good at making the news... not boring?<eos> Thank you.<eos> That is the goal.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't know though.<eos> - Still no promotion, huh?<eos> - No. Um, there is a segment producer that's supposed to leave in May, and they say that the job is mine, which is great, uh, except my landlord is selling my building.<eos> - And it was rent-controlled.<eos> - Your place is so amazing.<eos> He can just sell it?

He painted a mural on one of the walls, but Waltham chickened out.<eos> He painted over the mural when Harvey got hauled in front of the HUAC... the House Un-American Activities Committee.<eos> And then... everybody just kind of forgot about it.<eos> Until I looked through Harvey's sketchbook this afternoon.<eos> Um...<eos> - what do you mean?<eos> - I mean<eos> I called the art restoration lab at Columbia, we got one of your neighbors to let us into your apartment building, and we took an X-ray of the wall.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God, it's gonna be beautiful when they uncover it.

Can't you see how much fun I'm having?<eos> - Okay. Yeah.<eos> - Yeah. Have fun.<eos> - Okay. Thanks... thanks, Phil. - Yeah.<eos> Uh, hello, everyone.<eos> Nice to see you.<eos> It's been a long time.<eos> Hi, Melissa.<eos> I like your top.<eos> Maybe I could bedazzle it for you.
And then unpack them.<eos> Because there's no way in Norway we're going to Malibu.<eos> If they don't want you, I don't want them.<eos> Carol, no.<eos> We're staying in Tucson.<eos> - We're going to Malibu.<eos> - We're staying<eos> - in Tucson! - Carol, I can't ask you to make that sacrifice for me.<eos> You didn't ask me.<eos> I'm just doing it, 'cause that's what people do for those about whom they care!
And I surmise the lack of car chases and explosions did not pique your interest.<eos> Got you there.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Got me there-- oh, you saw that movie?<eos> Didn't see that movie.<eos> When did you see that movie?<eos> 1988. 1988? Oh, gentlemen, uh, please take your tedious discourse elsewhere.<eos> When was the movie made?<eos> 19... It was, probably wasn't even made in...<eos> Don't put your finger in, you're gonna burn it.
Which means we're back at square one.<eos> No, no, no, hold on.<eos> Hodgins said there was car polish found in the wound, right?<eos> Yes, but I don't see how that helps us.<eos> Don't worry, I got this one.<eos> What's that?<eos> That's your jewelry polish.<eos> Lab found traces of it in the victim's jaw.<eos> What happened, Tim, huh?<eos> Nesbit wasn't a big fan of your polish, so you tried repurposing it into a car polish?
Yes, but I don't see how that helps us.<eos> Don't worry, I got this one.<eos> What's that?<eos> That's your jewelry polish.<eos> Lab found traces of it in the victim's jaw.<eos> What happened, Tim, huh?<eos> Nesbit wasn't a big fan of your polish, so you tried repurposing it into a car polish?<eos> Just like Nesbit taught you,<eos> "never give up on anything."<eos> Lloyd hated it as a car polish as much as he hated it as a jewelry polish.
Excuse me.<eos> Doc Wade.<eos> Says she got something.<eos> Upon examining the victim, I found several traumatic injuries, but it's likely the fatal blow was to the skull.<eos> Hey, Danny, how you doing?<eos> Good.<eos> Cool?<eos> - Yes, sir. - Danny, where's Lieutenant... Garrett's paperwork?<eos> Filed it, just like you asked.<eos> No, these are alphabetical-- I asked you to file it by medical code.
Still, was hoping I could thank you by maybe taking you out sometime.<eos> Are you hitting on me at a funeral, Lieutenant?<eos> Yeah, well, recently came to my attention that life can be short.<eos> So what do you think?<eos> I think your timing is terrible.<eos> Call me tomorrow.<eos> Try then.<eos> Got to warn you, my idea of a first date starts at 15,000 feet up.<eos> Advance copy of my report to Washington, citing mechanical failure as the cause of the crash.<eos> I thought you should be the first one to see it.
Aasia.<eos> I got nothing to say until my lawyer gets here.<eos> Except, the little recording that bitch made is inadmissible.<eos> Even I know that.<eos> Maybe so, but she's my daughter.<eos> And that recording gave us probable cause for a search warrant.<eos> So you have a thing for necklaces.<eos> See this?<eos> Kathy Miller's initials.<eos> Her grandmother gave it to her.
Cass, you okay?<eos> I'm mostly confused.<eos> I'm not sure how orange correlates with black in a way that's new.<eos> Step away from the Netflix.<eos> Sorry. It's okay.<eos> We've all had a binge.<eos> You find anything in the lore?<eos> Well, there is a creature that feeds on hearts and blood.<eos> A were-pire, you might say?<eos> Come on, I know you wanna say it.
Dr. Barlow, please report to pediatric room 8.<eos> For Dr. Miller.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's a young woman's arm.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Tell him that I assessed the zone of injury, and it's still viable for reattachment<eos> - after a little clean-up.<eos> - What's the patient's name?<eos> We don't know yet.<eos> Just keep it here under Jane Doe till we do, please.
I need a curved kelley, suction, and O-silk.<eos> Mario, you got the M.T.P.?<eos> Uh, he's got it.<eos> Six of them coming in.<eos> Jesse, what's the E.T.A. on vascular?<eos> - Five minutes.<eos> - That's not good enough.<eos> We've got two choices.<eos> What are they?<eos> Pull the rod, potentially worsen the hole, but that might give us a chance to fix it.

I need a tourniquet, please.<eos> Here.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> That's too small.<eos> Mario, find the largest blood-pressure cuff you can and bring it over here.<eos> Suction, please. [ Air hissing ]<eos> Bring it over. Come on!<eos> Come on, come on!<eos> Out of the way.<eos> Get it over tight.
We'll lose the element of surprise.<eos> Got to have the doors open, McGee.<eos> The Ebola quarantine sealed the lab perimeter.<eos> For some reason, my people can't get access to the system to override it.<eos> It's Abby.<eos> She locked out the system.<eos> I recognize this anywhere, boss.<eos> This is the Sciuto Special.<eos> She has her own personal security hash.<eos> Bypass it.
Best case, you find someone amazing!<eos> Medium case, loosens you up for the right girl.<eos> When she breaks up with Atticus.<eos> I don't like Sam.<eos> But I don't know.<eos> Come on, come on, poke right with us.<eos> Poking right means all right.<eos> You might even partake in some consensual finger sucking.<eos> Okay. Fine.<eos> I'll do it.
You're cute.<eos> But Vaughn Du Clark expects results.<eos> Does a patient man invent an energy drink?<eos> I'd be happy to let him take over the zombie eradication detail.<eos> Just say the word.<eos> Let me tell you a story.<eos> When we first came up with the "Suspected Zombie" list,<eos> Vaughn's idea was to send them all letters, zombies and non-zombies alike, informing them they'd won an all-expense-paid Hawaiian cruise.<eos> And then scuttle the ship in the middle of the Pacific.<eos> Your work, distasteful as you find it, saves lives.
Looks like we're having quite the party.<eos> Massive.<eos> All my friends will be there.<eos> What was I saying back at the boutique about friends?<eos> Oh, right. Lose one, find another.<eos> Hello, friend.<eos> Happy birthday to me.<eos> Hey, I should invent a special cocktail.<eos> One part spicy whiskey, two parts zombie tears, a dash of hot sauce.<eos> I'll call it the Liv Learn.
You should have seen your faces.<eos> - Oh. - You were like, "what?<eos> W-we -- we really are j-just so sorry!"<eos> - You got us.<eos> - That was a good one, bro.<eos> You got to do shots with us.<eos> - Okay. - Munch, get the Jaeger.<eos> Yeah, should we serve the potion in cups of Dixie?<eos> - Or the --<eos> - Just get it, dude.
I drew up plans for a Duckingham Palace, but I can't find them, so I guess we'll just have to "wing" it.<eos> What the heck is that?<eos> Oh, it's a duck call to make the ducklings feel safe.<eos> Should there be another adult present?<eos> But there should be a kid present.<eos> That kid is you.<eos> You've got your whole life to roll your eyes.<eos> Today isn't just about building a duck village.<eos> It's about building your smile.<eos> Don't fight it.
Sie muessen Papp-Mache Berge zur Verfuegung stellen.<eos> And you provide the papier-mÃ¢ché mountain.<eos> Also facing a mountain?<eos> See, she only has two hours to write 2,500 words on The Great Gatsby... before Mateo needs to nurse.<eos> Oh, good!<eos> Looks like it's swimming along.<eos> You know, I've always loved The Great Gatsby.<eos> I'll bet Jane has an interesting take.<eos> Let's look.<eos> "After thawing breast milk, you cannot refreeze it."
Look, you don't have to share if you don't want to.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> Okay, that's not the answer<eos> -_ - she was expecting.<eos> Hey, Raf, uh, I am here to pick up Mateo.<eos> I'm walking into your house right now.<eos> Didn't you get my text?<eos> _<eos> Oh, no. I must have missed it.
Somebody ordered Chinese food for three, not just one.<eos> Still warm.<eos> Your mom and Trina come over for dinner, maybe?<eos> No, no, I was just hungry.<eos> And getting directions.<eos> Come here!<eos> He locked it.<eos> Unlock the computer.<eos> Tell us where they're headed.<eos> Unlock it.
There.<eos> You can see her feet and a hand.<eos> Everything looks good, Mr. and Mrs. Donahue.<eos> Oh, thank you for doing this.<eos> We just needed to see her again.<eos> She... she just squeezed my hand.<eos> I swear, I felt it.<eos> Her reflexes are still intact.<eos> Movement can occur, but it's not purposeful.<eos> No, she... she just did it again, right when you wiped her stomach.
We, uh, we read to the baby every night so she'll recognize our voices.<eos> I do that, too.<eos> Need to blow down her CO2, take her off the vent and bag her, give her a dose of Mannitol, and increase her Dopamine drip to 12.<eos> - Right away.<eos> - Doctor?<eos> Gina's intracranial pressure is rising.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> You said that she was getting better.<eos> Well, she is, in that her function was improving, but the swelling of her brain is getting worse.<eos> We're gonna try to control it with medication.
Go ahead.<eos> - She didn't answer you?<eos> - No.<eos> Let's just make sure she's there.<eos> - I can't, Mom, I have a friend over.<eos> - Your friend can wait.<eos> - What happened to the mirror?<eos> - It fell.<eos> - I can see that it fell.<eos> - I'll clean it up.
- of the moment, but I wanted to check and see if - please hang up the phone!<eos> That's still something you're comfortable with.<eos> Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's all good.<eos> Okay, I'll see you at the church.<eos> Petra is definitely pregnant.<eos> Well, Michael's the godfather.<eos> Rafael's totally fine with it.<eos> _<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> Look, when I got a call about your... sample, I went to return it, but then I ran into Luisa and she told me that you well, that you did... love me.
Something's wrong with this woman.<eos> I mean it.<eos> I think she could be a hoarder.<eos> - _<eos> - Oh, she is.<eos> Her episode of Celebrity Hoarders was epic.<eos> Wow. What's that?<eos> Your diary?<eos> It's not a diary.<eos> Then let me read it.
Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Last look.<eos> Is it true I didn't get the part?<eos> This is not a good time.<eos> We are about to shoot a death-defying scene.<eos> Come on, people.<eos> We're about to go into triple overtime.<eos> I thought we could do this the easy way, Rogelio.<eos> But, uh, if you're not gonna give me the part because I deserve it, then you're gonna have to give it to me so I don't release this.
- Where's the painting?<eos> - I don't have it.<eos> Cut the crap, Freddy.<eos> You got one chance to convince me that you're not the murderer.<eos> Okay, listen, I was at the garage, but not to kill the guy.<eos> - I was hired to retrieve the painting.<eos> - By who?<eos> Tom Gilliam.<eos> Head of the Falcon Unit.<eos> That's who hired Justin to transport it.

Excuse me!<eos> Tom Gilliam, I'm Detective Ryan.<eos> This is Detective Esposito.<eos> We just have a few questions about the murder of Justin Fletcher.<eos> A real tragedy, but I don't know anything about it.<eos> That's funny, 'cause Freddy Stark says you do.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Well, you can start by telling us why you hired Freddy to steal that painting back from your own employee.<eos> You got it all wrong.<eos> I didn't hire Freddy to steal it.

It's who you are that is.<eos> You're married to the captain of the 12th precinct, where a certain work of art is being held.<eos> You're going to go and get it for me.<eos> Give me one good reason why I should.<eos> I'll give you two.<eos> - Oh!<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Put... put the gun back... back to me.<eos> Point it at me.
You're going to go and get it for me.<eos> Give me one good reason why I should.<eos> I'll give you two.<eos> - Oh!<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Put... put the gun back... back to me.<eos> Point it at me.<eos> Look, that painting belongs to my family.<eos> My father spent his life trying to find it.
Now, what are we gonna find there?<eos> The gun that you used?<eos> The original Van Gogh?<eos> H-he was my brother.<eos> I-I-I didn't want to kill him.<eos> I just... I-I needed the money.<eos> So, can you tell the difference?<eos> Uh... No.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Oh, I, uh, spoke to the current owner, told him the whole story, and he pledged that he's going to give it to the state museum while Lorenzo's family's issue is being adjudicated.
We fully understood what the repercussions of this would be.<eos> That's why I made him hire the security.<eos> I just...<eos> I just never imagined that something like this would happen.<eos> Listen, we really appreciate your time.<eos> We're gonna do everything we can to find out who's responsible for this, okay?<eos> All right, I get it.<eos> Samoans clip this guy because they do not want him to go on record about the protection money.<eos> But I got a hunch that they did not do it themselves.<eos> They hired somebody to do it.
I'm not sure, but at least some of it was going to this guy- - John Messer.<eos> According to the books,<eos> Harper was paying him 150k a year to consult on the business.<eos> Thing is, nobody in the entire company had ever heard of this guy.<eos> Yeah, the checks were being sent to an address on Maui, where it just so happens, a Kevin Harper was making regular monthly visits.<eos> Even though the company doesn't have any business interests there.<eos> Okay, and there's no driver's license or photo ID for this guy on file.<eos> No, just some bank info.<eos> All right, so I'm gonna take a wild guess and say that this Messer does not exist.<eos> All right, you, uh, you come up with a fake name, you put it on the payroll, and then, you cash the checks yourself.
That could be anybody.<eos> That bike is customized exactly the same way as the bikes you and your crew ride.<eos> Coincidence.<eos> It's the same gun that you and your crew use.<eos> Look, I didn't shoot anyone.<eos> Not yourself, no,<eos> I believe that, but here's the thing.<eos> This is my problem, all right.<eos> You got a five man team.<eos> When you hit that truck, you hit it with four guys.
Well, the police report assumed that because he didn't have child locks on his truck, that she wandered off into the desert for some reason.<eos> You know, I saw where they found the body. There's no way she could have found her way back to the road.<eos> Well, the way the temperatures drop in the desert at night, she didn't stand a chance.<eos> Yeah, but, Hotch, you should have seen this guy.<eos> I mean, up until the very end, he was adamant that a guy with a skull tattoo abducted his daughter.<eos> Well, the unsub with a ghost in his mind is always dangerous.<eos> Unless it wasn't all in his mind.<eos> Ugh, it's really coming down.<eos> Haven't you had enough of that thing?<eos> You know, once we get to grandma's house, she's going to make you put it away.
The malware shut down access to those departments.<eos> Everything is blocked off.<eos> I can't get into anything.<eos> Well, our target owns this hospital.<eos> I found a timestamp of the first sign of malware.<eos> Our target injected this malware five months ago.<eos> Hospital systems are complicated.<eos> Probably took the target that long just to learn the system.<eos> Can we quarantine the malware?<eos> I can write a script that will scrub it off the network.
He helped write the ventilator patch.<eos> All right, checking the pharmacy now.<eos> There it is!<eos> The command that changed Thomas' medical record came from a local router port!<eos> They didn't scrub the last hack?<eos> They weren't in the system long.<eos> Must've been moving so fast they made a mistake!<eos> Wait.<eos> The device is inside the hospital!<eos> Guys, I'm tracing it now!
There has to be something you can do.<eos> So when... when humans breathe, they inhale dust and pollen and other airborne microbes from the environment, right?<eos> So where they have been determines what's in their lungs.<eos> That TV is like a living organism.<eos> It needs to breathe to function, so it has this fan that keeps the unit from overheating by sucking in cooling air.<eos> And then whatever particles are flying around get sucked in, too.<eos> And they, uh, stick to the fan blades.<eos> Oh, there you are.<eos> Okay, all right.<eos> So... so after we sequence the DNA from this specimen, we can run it through the index of airborne microbes-- it's a nationwide database of where bacteria resides.
Don't move!<eos> You better hope you can reach for that before I shoot.<eos> I think that's my buddy's seat.<eos> Nice, subtle.<eos> All right, Walter, we found the remote user.<eos> I'm at his computer now.<eos> Then slow us down!<eos> It's not that easy.<eos> He had locked-in operational protocol.<eos> If I want to stop the train, I have to shut it down and reboot first.
I'm at his computer now.<eos> Then slow us down!<eos> It's not that easy.<eos> He had locked-in operational protocol.<eos> If I want to stop the train, I have to shut it down and reboot first.<eos> Not enough time!<eos> Paige, we're 30 seconds away from that switch!<eos> You got to hit that lever!<eos> Yeah, I can see the switch!<eos> I'll be able to hit it!
Keep eating, richard.<eos> I shall return.<eos> Matias, i don't appreciate being summoned.<eos> Talk to me about andras halmi.<eos> You thought the task force was holding something back. They were.<eos> Who is he?<eos> How do you know what i was or was not thinking?<eos> I know everything, peter.<eos> Almost always before you. Your analyst discovered<eos> That they deleted halmi's name so you wouldn't find it.
After tonight, we're gonna have a story that everyone likes to tell.<eos> Take me!<eos> Please?<eos> Yeah, maybe this isn't the best costume.<eos> - Damona.<eos> - Huh?<eos> I have a major problem.<eos> Are you the one who dropped her lipstick in the toilet?<eos> Leave it, girl.<eos> Just leave it.
Come on. Let's get up to the top before he decides to breakdance.<eos> Yeah. No idea what that means!<eos> And you say Groot don't make no sense.<eos> Keep Groot busy.<eos> He can't attack the village if he's after us.<eos> I shall do my best to occupy his attention.<eos> I am Groot!<eos> Drax, look!<eos> That meteor must be the source of the fungus.<eos> Then I will destroy it at once!
And don't look him in the eye.<eos> Who you talkin' about, quill?<eos> Oh, hey, Lou. Buddy.<eos> This is... Looking at me?<eos> Nobody looks at me.<eos> I'm the one who looks.<eos> I'm just messin' with you.<eos> Anyway, uh, you remember we talked?<eos> The pandorian crystal?<eos> Oh, yeah. Sorry, man. My lady friend, she wanted it.
Two, if I won that racing ship, you could have the Milano. 'Cause, you know, I'm nice that way.<eos> And three, Drax was, like, unbeatable.<eos> One, Drax paid for the ship, not you.<eos> Two, we don't need another ship.<eos> And, three, "like, unbeatable" is not the same as "unbeatable."<eos> I am Groot.<eos> What do you mean, custom sizing costs extra?<eos> Ooh, is this real leather?<eos> The energy dome over the arena is being projected from the grandmaster's tower.<eos> We just have to take it out.
When we're done here.<eos> As expected, he was a peach.<eos> You mind telling us where you were last night around 10:00?<eos> Uh, my place.<eos> Knocking back a few beers. With Sue.<eos> He was with me all night.<eos> (STRUMS)<eos> You got a good eye there, miss.<eos> - How long you been playing?<eos> - Just picked it up.
We can't bring Hyde in until the circle is complete.<eos> So, er... so you're not going to punish me?<eos> - I need someone to look after my pet for me.<eos> (Fedora whispers)<eos> (Chuckles)<eos> Is it all right?<eos> It looks a bit deformed.<eos> FEDORA: It's called a Seeing Toad.<eos> Some people lick them to gain mystical knowledge and second sight.<eos> (Chuckles) Well, I'm certainly not gonna lick it.
Oh, sorry.<eos> - Do you know what an incubus is?<eos> - Yes. A demon.<eos> They appear to you in the form of the person you love most in the world.<eos> They feed on your soul, drain your life force.<eos> Yes.<eos> It seems one of them has escaped into this world.<eos> I don't understand every word of that but...<eos> Keres's juju men have... sensed its vibrations.<eos> You are to drop everything and find it.
Are you ready to give me my blood spike back?<eos> Well, I don't think that wicked little Olalla should have her toy.<eos> Not until she's learned to behave herself.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> I don't want a moral sermon from you of all people.<eos> I've never seen you happier.<eos> Why don't you just admit that you're tempted to use that on yourself?<eos> Live as you are now all the time.<eos> Which is why Robert Jekyll wants to get rid of this damn thing.<eos> But what if I gave it to you and you just simply ran off?
No, we can connect via a peripheral system.<eos> Like the sprinkler controls or...<eos> The sewer system.<eos> (computer blipping)<eos> HAPPY (quietly):<eos> Okay...<eos> I am in their intranet, but their medical records are tight as a drum.<eos> And with our best hackers elsewhere, this could take hours. Days.<eos> So we're stuck in a sewer for no good reason?<eos> Unless we can call Sly to hack it.
Guys, we can get out of this, right?<eos> Maybe not, this is a state-of-the-art R D facility, meaning everything is state of the art.<eos> This electromagnetic lock has a pound force of over 4,000.<eos> Double what I've ever seen.<eos> Oh, that's great.<eos> The one lock you've never seen.<eos> PAIGE:<eos> Okay, do what we always do.<eos> Embrace the unknown with cold facts.<eos> Someone installed this lock, then someone can uninstall it.
No, the dishes aren't electromagnetic!<eos> Then take it off broadcast mode, cut off its transmissions, so we can call Sylvester. HAPPY:<eos> Uh, no, the best way to interrupt the airwaves is to interfere with the--<eos> Or that.<eos> Okay...<eos> I got a signal!<eos> I'm calling Sly.<eos> Coughlan launches a dozen drone flights a day.<eos> I should be able to hack into one from here.<eos> Okay, if you adjust its frequencies, you can scan the plane's gamma ray signature, and you can locate it like we did this morning.
So if I run out of voice tonight, it's their damn fault.<eos> (CLEARS THROAT) In the early days of television, commercials were done live in front of studio audiences.<eos> Well, just like back then, I get to do my own commercial for you, right now.<eos> For something that I am selling.<eos> Ready?<eos> (AUDIENCE CHEERING) It's the Little Jeff ventriloquist dummy!<eos> (AUDIENCE CHEERING)<eos> So, let me show you how a professional ventriloquist dummy works, all right?<eos> So in the box, this is more than just a dummy in the box, it's a full circle program that I have, uh, come up with here, you also get a DVD.<eos> On the DVD are me and all the guys from my shop, teaching how to do ventriloquism, anybody can learn to do it, just takes some practice.
I will never blow up anything if I don't have my lucky charm, which I lost.<eos> You had a lucky charm.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What was it?<eos> I had a little camel's toe.<eos> (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)<eos> What the heh are they laughing at?<eos> What?<eos> I had a little camel toe.<eos> You used to look at it all the time!
You had a lucky charm.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What was it?<eos> I had a little camel's toe.<eos> (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)<eos> What the heh are they laughing at?<eos> What?<eos> I had a little camel toe.<eos> You used to look at it all the time!<eos> I'm not kidding, he would rub it for good luck.
Hi, I'm Bonnie, and I'm an alcoholic.<eos> Well, there's only nine more dating days till Christmas, and I'm starting to lose hope.<eos> I mean, how is it this package has no one to unwrap it on Christmas morning?
After a lot of soul-searching and prayer, I, uh, decided I'm not an alcoholic.<eos> You're not just saying that to get out of the dance, are you?<eos> If so, I'm not an alcoholic either.<eos> So, first night of the conference, a bunch of us went out to dinner, and Reverend Baker ordered a bottle of Cabernet.<eos> The waiter filled my glass, and I looked at it, and I thought, "I think I can handle this."<eos> And you know what?<eos> I was right.<eos> I didn't even finish my glass.<eos> I did that once.<eos> But only because the ambulance driver insisted I put it down.
You told me that already.<eos> But what I didn't tell you was I had some people I know pick up the body before the cops put it on the books.<eos> Those paramedics?<eos> They were yours?<eos> Technically, Andromeda's.<eos> My associate, but yes.<eos> Arthur, did you kill Omri Nellas?<eos> No.<eos> That crime was random.<eos> But I did cover it up long enough to walk into One Capital Trust this morning with Nellas's I.D. and liquidate all of his accounts.
And I'm going forward with this.<eos> I don't care what it's gonna cost me.<eos> If you want to do a rotation at another hospital, take some time off, whatever you need, okay?<eos> No questions asked.<eos> I've got your back.<eos> Good work, Charlie.<eos> Good and quick.<eos> Eh, no joy being the butcher, but... it had to be done.<eos> This job is all I have, Charlie.<eos> What if I can't do it anymore?
- No! - No what?<eos> No! Okay, okay, I get it.<eos> I can't say that word.<eos> You cannot.<eos> But I can't sing it?<eos> You cannot.<eos> Mitch, it's... it's just not a word that you have access to.<eos> You should hear me do it because I don't pronounce the R.<eos> You better not pronounce the R.<eos> What if I hum it?
Is it me, or does it seem like<eos> Mitch and Tracy are going through a rough patch?<eos> I'll prove it.<eos> I'm calling Tracy.<eos> - No, no, no, we're convinced.<eos> - You're not a liar.<eos> What you're about to do, don't do that.<eos> Hi, hon, yeah, the guys and I were disagreeing about something.<eos> I just wanted to get your input.<eos> Grab the phone and throw it out the window!
And this won't affect my work at all.<eos> Okay, what do you got?<eos> The Glock from, um, Cousin Roy?<eos> Yeah, the one we took off him.<eos> It's the one you guys seized from the scene because it was illegal.<eos> Roy was booked, but he posted bail.<eos> Well, tell me something I don't know.<eos> Um, the serial number is gone, past the point of raising it.<eos> It was filed down deep.<eos> Can you un-file it?
So that's Mitch's dad.<eos> NIS Agent Kurt Mitchell.<eos> I never would've connected the two.<eos> And he was assigned to protect Gibbs' family?<eos> 1991.<eos> Oceanside.<eos> I thought Shannon and Kelly lived here.<eos> They did.<eos> They followed Gibbs to Pendleton before he deployed.<eos> You can pull up the old NIS file and read it for yourself.
I'm going to fire you.<eos> I'm gonna fire you, fire, fire...<eos> - Fire, fire?<eos> - Fire.<eos> You can't fucking fire me.<eos> Lennox, I can.<eos> Yes, because you know what?<eos> It's in my contract, and that is my red tape.<eos> And you cannot cut that red tape.<eos> I can cut it, but you cannot cut it, okay?
How do you think that would go?<eos> Not good, right?<eos> Because I don't play cello.<eos> So don't you try to come into my office and think you can do what I do.<eos> No, I don't think I can do what you do, but I can damn well do my version of it.<eos> You... you're on to some other city as soon as this is over.<eos> You think that as soon as I seal the deal on these negotiations, that I'm gonna move onto someone else?<eos> You have one hell of a fucking ego.<eos> The orchestra is my family.<eos> I won't let anyone or anything hurt it.
He was at the concert last night and heard you play.<eos> He thought he was going to hear me.<eos> Betty said you were great.<eos> The articulation, the placement...<eos> You have such a naturally flexible soft palate.<eos> It's wonderful.<eos> He's right.<eos> You play beautifully.<eos> Hailey, we're about to lose our second chair oboist.<eos> The job is yours if you want it.
Okay, okay, okay, so, this guy is running for president, and he hates immigrants, and he's basically an idiot.<eos> Not surprisingly, this guy is from a predominantly white town called South Park, Colorado, - or shit heads of America, Incorporated. - I'm not sure.<eos> Yeah, if this guy's the best their town has to offer, can you imagine who he left behind?<eos> Well, hey, I'm from South Park!<eos> We don't take kindly to respecting human beings!<eos> Y-You think South Park has a university?<eos> Welcome to South Park University.<eos> Please open your shotguns and slap your wives.<eos> I live in South Park, and my IQ's so low, I gots to dig for it.
It's a side effect from one of the early vaccines given to everyone on Zona.<eos> But not you?<eos> I've never been.<eos> I've only seen the inside of this sub since we evacuated Mt. Wilson.<eos> How do you even know Zona's real then?<eos> I worked for some of the people who first founded Zona before the outbreak.<eos> They're the only ones left with enough power and resources to stop this plague.<eos> We almost had it.<eos> But the vaccine only slows down the virus.<eos> It doesn't kill it or make you immune.
All of them.<eos> Relax, babe.<eos> There's no rush.<eos> There is.<eos> I mean, I've gone along with everything that you've asked me to do-- some of it a little too freakish.<eos> Please do this for me.<eos> Here's your money back.<eos> What is that for?<eos> It's for my Caf-POW!<eos> -- I don't deserve it.
This is funny to you?<eos> This is my career we're talking about.<eos> Take a breath.<eos> You really think I'm gonna expose the president to a scandal with an election coming up? Come on.<eos> It's a bluff.<eos> How much you want to bet that reporter is working for Mike B.?<eos> Just to screw me.<eos> Yeah, well, she'll regret it, believe me.<eos> What about the story? Just to screw me.<eos> Yeah, well, she'll regret it, believe me.
No, I had a conversation with a senator from Illinois.<eos> Yes.<eos> But then again... there's this.<eos> That's the planner you shredded in your office last night.<eos> Planner that contained evidence of your conspiracy with Senator Parisi.<eos> "Contained" being the operative word.<eos> You can't prove anything.<eos> - Thing is, we don't have to.<eos> - That planner also had notes of official White House meetings.<eos> By destroying it, you violated the Presidential Records Act of 1978.
$24.<eos> And yeah, Filly Cheesesteak's a female in a male field, but she's breaking from a single-figure draw, she's a demon on mud and we both know you don't bring in a jockey like Santiago if you're just there for the juleps.<eos> Take it.<eos> (COMMENTARY RUNNING ON TELEVISION)<eos> Oh.<eos> Silver dollar.<eos> Make it 25.<eos> That silver dollar.<eos> Is that a Susan B. Anthony?<eos> Then you keep it.
You can do this. You can do this.<eos> Do you want to look like an '80s broadcaster for the rest of your life?<eos> Lynette... he broke up with me.<eos> - How come everyone I love... always leaves me?<eos> - Oh, for Pete's sake.<eos> I said, I-I'm so sorry, and I know you'd like to process this privately, so...<eos> - No, no, no. No, I have, um...<eos> - I look fine.<eos> I'm just gonna go. I have, um, some white wine in my purse.<eos> And we could just put it over ice.
And yet, this is a motion to dismiss.<eos> And as much as you three are treating it like a full-on trial, I have a life, I'd like to get back to it, so overruled.<eos> Do you want me to repeat the question, Doctor?<eos> No, you are correct.<eos> An analogue of a drug is treated, under the law, as an illegal drug.<eos> And isn't it also true that no matter how elegant the defendant's<eos> - attempt to elude the law is...<eos> - Objection!<eos> I'll rephrase.<eos> No matter how elegant this new chemical compound is, the high associated with it is identical to GHB?
That'sfourlegs on four wheels.<eos> Ah,thatdog thinks it's people.<eos> Up next, a very upsetting story out of Omaha.<eos> A downtown bar fight escalated tragically last night. And "OWW2 news" brings you an exclusive video of the event.<eos> The footage you're about to view is extremely graphic.<eos> Efforts were made to resuscitate the victim, but unfor--<eos> Hey, officer. I still haven't gotten my phone call.<eos> Do you think I could get a pizza delivered in here?<eos> You're not the deputy.<eos> Boss' daughter's been making a mess in town, and it's my job to clean it up.
I mean, they want their God to be a-a f-finger-snapping, all-powerful creator, you know...<eos> And they want magic... Mary Poppins.<eos> But what he did -- creation... that took work.<eos> Took sacrifice.<eos> In order to create the world, God had to give up the only thing he'd ever known.<eos> He had to betray and sacrifice his only kin.<eos> The Darkness...<eos> His sister.<eos> It's been great seeing you again, Dean, but it's time for me to go.<eos> There's a whole world out there for me to explore, and I can practically taste it.
In fact, this fella looks well-minded.<eos> Clean skin, no scratches.<eos> I bet his owner is worried sick about him.<eos> Should've looked after it better then, shouldn't they?<eos> What, like throwing a coat over him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> OK, thank you.<eos> We should be getting on.<eos> Yeah, can I...? Can I touch it?<eos> - Oh, now you want to touch it?
to pant and struggle on the frost-tinged stillness of a Montana...<eos> Dawn.<eos> And she would lay her body beside them as their mothers licked them clean, smelling of sweet straw and the tang of birth, thinking, 'we are alive, alive, alive.'"<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing?<eos> You inspired me.<eos> You keep saying feminists love Frank.<eos> I'm a feminist.<eos> I don't love Frank.<eos> Turns out the women's movement has a pretty great legacy, too.<eos> I've decided it's my job to protect it.
Some mission?<eos> A... Kidnapping?<eos> You're working for someone.<eos> Olivia?<eos> I'm her father... Olivia's.<eos> I am... A father.<eos> Hers, Jake's...<eos> I have so many sons, so many ungrateful children.<eos> There is no gratitude in parenting.<eos> I don't know why we do it.
If what we're doing really matters.<eos> In the end, we're all just government employees, aren't we?<eos> After we're gone, someone will take our place.<eos> New criminals replace the old.<eos> Make you want to give it all up for a different life?<eos> I know why you're really here.<eos> Hornet.<eos> Most people aren't aware there are multiple Darknets.<eos> Tor network is just one of them.<eos> There are over two million users on Tor, which is slowing it down, making it too vulnerable.
It's risky.<eos> Every time you go around Sands, bad things happen.<eos> Worse than a slow, mind-bendingly terrible death?<eos> How do you even get close to someone like Senator Morra?<eos> It's not easy to get to him, but it might be possible to talk to people close to him.<eos> Hi there.<eos> So I have footage of Senator Morra in bed with the majority leader's wife.<eos> A third party jumps in there too after a while.<eos> Not sure who that is yet.<eos> I was gonna put it on the market.
On my count.<eos> 2, 1.<eos> I should get back.<eos> Federal agents!<eos> Nobody move!<eos> You told me that I should have stayed on the boat and never come back.<eos> The truth is I never should have left.<eos> You were in trouble, and I walked away.<eos> You had a dream.<eos> I wanted you to follow it.
Federal agents!<eos> Nobody move!<eos> You told me that I should have stayed on the boat and never come back.<eos> The truth is I never should have left.<eos> You were in trouble, and I walked away.<eos> You had a dream.<eos> I wanted you to follow it.<eos> I still do.<eos> That's what I'm trying to tell you, Liz.<eos> I am following it.
- Where?<eos> The covert source record room.<eos> If that's where the list is, that's where Hasaan is going.<eos> In a few minutes, half the federal agents in Washington will have that building surrounded.<eos> Your only job for now is to stay alive.<eos> I have to stop him.<eos> Keep your hands behind your head.<eos> We got the location from your men in Jordan.<eos> All we need is the code.<eos> I'll never give it to you.
Lots of transaction logs, e-mails; not to mention, all the trash talking on the message boards.<eos> Oh, I love a good trash talking.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> I-I'm not sure I quite understand what fantasy football is.<eos> Oh, you'd love it.<eos> It's a statistical game, where the members, uh, form a league, and then they-they compete against each other by drafting real football players.<eos> Right, and your players, they earn you points when they gain yards or they catch passes or they score touchdowns.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But these teams don't technically exist.<eos> Oh, they take it very seriously, Bones.
I'm not really the, uh, outdoorsy type.<eos> Oh, nonsense.<eos> I can cover for both of you.<eos> Besides, being in nature will be good for Mr. Happy.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Wow. Do you miss anything?<eos> Not that I'm confirming anything.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm around a lot of older men with the same issue.<eos> After a while, you can practically smell it on a man.
Dad, do you think that's what I should do?<eos> Yeah, sure. 'Cause the other way to go is we chase the win.<eos> You know, I bet on myself, take the big swing.<eos> Okay. Do you have any... any advice for me on whether I should even swing?<eos> And if I do, what I should swing for?<eos> I don't even know what the hell you're talking about.<eos> Well, Dad, let's... let's say I swing.<eos> Um, should I have, a-a goal, you know, or a-a target in mind?<eos> Some sort of, like, a... like, a chain-link barrier or, like, a... like, a white picket thing?<eos> For what it's worth, I took a really big swing with this lunch order, and I am really regretting it.
That depends.<eos> Does the name Sandy Malmuth ring a bell?<eos> Sandy... Malmuth... I need more.<eos> Okay. Well, then, what if I told you that this isn't the first time we've shared this stage together?<eos> Wait, that might be helpful.<eos> Nope, lost it.<eos> That's funny.<eos> Because I also lost something, once upon a time.<eos> The role that I was born to play, was cast to play.<eos> Until I broke my ankle and took it from you.
- Because if Ethan went in there and did half of what I taught him, he earned that part.<eos> We just need proof.<eos> There's got to be a video.<eos> - On Malmuth's computer.<eos> - What? Claire, how quickly can we set up a meeting with our hacker?<eos> Uh, never, because we don't have one.<eos> We don't? We had a whole team of them at Stutz Grinder.<eos> They saved our ass all the time.<eos> I took an Excel course in college.<eos> Maybe I could do it.
We're doing our best, sir.<eos> We'll catch it soon!<eos> You'd better.<eos> If not, you'll be held responsible.<eos> I'll investigate your full intentions.<eos> What full intentions, sir?<eos> You are a native Corean, are you not?<eos> If you don't want to arouse suspicion... bring me that tiger!<eos> You volunteered to catch it.<eos> You know how much I want it!
Don't bother him.<eos> We have no other choice.<eos> But still!<eos> Don't do it, pal!<eos> After what happened to his wife...<eos> Just more reason to catch him!<eos> Still!<eos> He finally forgot and moved on.<eos> I... don't think so.<eos> We both want to pull his liver out and chew it to pieces!
You think I don't notice what's happening here... day drinking, acting out against me?<eos> I miss that man I first gave that trophy to.<eos> She's right.<eos> Come on, let's go win this.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Racism.<eos> Where were you?<eos> Looking through more discovery.<eos> Well, at least someone got her jollies today.<eos> Well, got to get it in while you can.
- I did nothing illegal.<eos> It was the detectives and the prosecution that hid this tape from us.<eos> I will be looking into that misconduct, believe me, but that does not mean you get to bring illegally obtained evidence into my courtroom.<eos> I'll say it again...<eos> I did nothing illegal.<eos> And I don't believe you.<eos> Not to mention studies show witnesses in the midst of trauma often don't remember facts correctly at first, hence my decision.<eos> Let the record note that the court has decided to allow the deceased's testimony to be presented at trial.<eos> Your honor, we've just proven that the only eyewitness account in this trial was built on prejudice.<eos> Save it for the trial, Miss Keating.
No hits, but that doesn't mean the murderer is entirely unknown.<eos> The authorities have a name-- The Ghost.<eos> The Ghost?<eos> Invisible, elusive, sinister.<eos> And responsible for a decade-long killing spree.<eos> Talked to the DEA and the FBI.<eos> Every involved in investigating The Ghost-- they got nothing.<eos> So, what we do know?<eos> The Ghost works for the Triads-- major flakka manufacturer in China.<eos> They smuggle it into the States, make alliances with the local gangs, who do the street-level dealing.
People... like you.<eos> Those are all the numbers.<eos> It's too short for a phone number.<eos> It's not a map coordinate.<eos> Bar code, maybe a serial number?<eos> Maybe some sort of multiple of the Euler-Mascheroni constant?<eos> I'm just thinking outside the box.<eos> Wait.<eos> If there are nine numbers... that could work as an IP address.<eos> Let me, uh, running a permutation generator and attach it to a search of Web sites.
See you next time.<eos> Next time.<eos> You bet.<eos> Nice to see you, Agent Percy.<eos> Who was that?<eos> Agent out of Washington.<eos> Just sold my... unofficial first drink.<eos> Well, I was in the office when you called, so I was there to receive this.<eos> Dropped off by you favorite councilman.<eos> Said you can wear it next year.

That was a, uh, a-a cool video, Gerald.<eos> Thanks for showing me that.<eos> - Okay, we'll see ya.<eos> - Stop this charade, Vanessa!<eos> - Good night, Vanessa.<eos> - See ya!<eos> I'm never drinking again.<eos> Hey, um, my journal's on my nightstand.<eos> Will you write down all the good stuff that happened tonight?<eos> No, but I will read it and make fun of you.
Excuse me...<eos> Uh, big fan of your food.<eos> Oh, nice.<eos> That's why I got into this game.<eos> Great.<eos> Uh, uh... random question... uh, is there any way I could, like, rent your costume for a couple hours?<eos> I'll pay anything.<eos> Yep.<eos> I get it.<eos> Just make sure you dry clean it.
Yeah?<eos> Well, it's probably the mom hormones, but you're pretty hot when you do that dorky dad stuff.<eos> Later, Señor Plucky.<eos> ♪ Happy birthday to you.<eos> Boy, your second birthday was a real barn-burner, huh?<eos> Look at that.<eos> Sorry I missed it.<eos> Wish I had been there.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Way it shook out, I, uh, I'm glad you get to watch it with me now.
Let me stay on Philip, see what he does...<eos> So you can screw up again?<eos> - No, I don't want you anywhere near this!<eos> - I'll tail him.<eos> - Stop it. I can't have you...<eos> - I got the day off.<eos> What else am I gonna do?<eos> Go get your computer.<eos> - Why?<eos> - So that we can destroy it before boo Radley goes to the police.
- No, Tandy, I said no!<eos> I'm in too deep, man.<eos> So we just keep up this routine till the bacon is gone, and then we go our separate ways, and this never happened.<eos> Fine.<eos> Just about the bacon.<eos> Voilà.<eos> I'm so hammered, I see two fingers, but they're both perfectly stitched.<eos> You could give our little seamstress Carol here a run for her money.<eos> - Phil? - Hey.<eos> Why don't you take that comment, put it inside a bottle and shove it up your butt?
"Hey, let's go share this with the community."<eos> "Screw the friggin' community!" I said.<eos> "Eat this with me, and we'll go down together."<eos> Then he said, "That's wrong, sir.<eos> Never!"<eos> So I pulled a gun on him... you guys know<eos> I do that from time to time.<eos> Then he took the gun, and he put it in his mouth and said, "Pull the trigger, 'cause I would rather be dead than not share this pork product with the people I love."<eos> And as I cocked my gun, he calmly walked over, picked up the three remaining bacons, marched straight out the door and delivered them to you guys, tied up in a bow.<eos> 'Cause when Todd gives you bacon, he puts a bow on it.
Congratulations, Brick.<eos> Future you is quite the ladies' man.<eos> Thanks for taking me tonight, Dad.<eos> Drink it in, 'cause this is the last time I'm taking you trick-or-treating.<eos> You never know.<eos> Next year, I might be younger.<eos> Don't make too much out of what happened tonight, Brick.<eos> There's a lot of weird coincidences in the world.<eos> You can't overthink it.<eos> A father and a son on Halloween night One determined not to see the future, one destined to know it.
Wait, you saw him?<eos> He found me.<eos> I tried to get away, tried to tell him I couldn't talk.<eos> We literally had a two-minute conversation.<eos> Raven, did you speak to him about the Barnaby Bank case?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Besides, I saw him before we started working on this.<eos> I don't know how he figured out that I wrote that code.<eos> Probably hacked your phone when he saw you yesterday.<eos> That would explain why your phone isn't connected to the FBI network-- Jackson's controlling it.

When?<eos> Last night.<eos> She was only here a month.<eos> Didn't have much to pack-- just threw it in the town car that came to pick her up.<eos> She leave a forwarding address or phone number?<eos> Nope.<eos> Gone like the wind.<eos> She took back her security deposit, but left dishes in the sink.<eos> We're gonna need the name and number of your management company, all right?<eos> I'll get it for you.
Ah, look what I found in the garage, huh?<eos> Same size that was used to chop up the body.<eos> AUBREY:<eos> Looks like we found your proof.<eos> We know the victim was struck by three seemingly disparate objects.<eos> The first is a sharp V-shaped cleft. The second injury was the result of a long, hard, flat surface striking the ulna.<eos> Well, whatever it is, it measures at least 20 centimeters.<eos> The third injury was caused by an uneven, rocky surface.<eos> The blow to the side of the face. The perimortem damage was just under eight centimeters.<eos> I don't see it.
Determining the exact aluminum alloy would help narrow it down a bit.<eos> But with the blackout, I can't even power up the XRF Spectrometer.<eos> Okay, okay, so, why don't you let me know when you find out something.<eos> You got it.<eos> And, hey, to get out, you must take the left tunnel!<eos> Oh! Smooth move, Indy.<eos> Pride needs to scrap this piece of junk.<eos> Just call me Ms. Woobie.<eos> Mr. Woobie belonged to my brother Cade.<eos> He'd keep it in my room 'cause he didn't want people to know he was afraid of the dark.
Sometimes it brings out the worst.<eos> But then, just when you think you've figured out how it's all gonna go, a stranger brings your cat back to you three months after the storm.<eos> Then stays to help fix your busted-up roof.<eos> That's new Orleans.<eos> Doesn't take electricity to light it up.<eos> You're Agent Pride, right? Yes, sir.<eos> Bart Johnson, lead on the job.<eos> Hey, Bart, know you're busy.<eos> Understatement.<eos> Just when we get power back up in Marigny and Bywater, lose it in Central City and the Garden District.
I called to say one thing, which is what we talked about is no longer on the table.<eos> Gloria, don't be hasty.<eos> This article thing wasn't my idea, I promise you.<eos> I don't give a damn whose idea it was.<eos> I've given the last 20 years of my life to this orchestra.<eos> You think you musicians are the only people who live and breathe music?<eos> You're not!<eos> Listen, listen, let's you and I get together.<eos> We'll have a coffee, and we'll figure this out.<eos> If I had coffee with you right now, I just may throw it in your face.
Oxygen.<eos> Okay... okay. There you go.<eos> All right.<eos> - I'll take him to the NICU.<eos> - I'll take him.<eos> She hasn't delivered the placenta yet.<eos> It has to come out.<eos> Where the hell is OB?<eos> Stuck in a delivery.<eos> I can do it.
So you're deserting me in my hour of need to go get laid?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> It's strictly business.<eos> She wants to pitch me on their new TXA product.<eos> Whatever.<eos> I was frantic trying to figure out where she'd gotten off to.<eos> Mr. Donovan, how long have we been in the Connie Francis era?<eos> We met in Fort Lauderdale, Spring Break, 1960... same year "Where the Boys Are" came out.<eos> Carol loved that movie.<eos> She mixes it up in our life.
My boss was behind on his protection payments, so Pulpo found other ways to get his protection money.<eos> Like steal our deliveries.<eos> Today they robbed the restaurant.<eos> What did they take from you?<eos> Drugs?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I told you I never open the packages, but this one was important.<eos> Important how?<eos> My boss said the sender paid a fortune to have this package delivered.<eos> If I don't get it back, I'm a dead man.
Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt.<eos> You sure you want to do this, kid?<eos> Wallets in the bag.<eos> Now!<eos> No, not you.<eos> You're gonna open the safe.<eos> And it better just be money you're pulling out of there, nothing funny.<eos> Nobody's laughing, kid.<eos> No, you can have it.<eos> But you won't be alive long enough to spend it.

Slowly.<eos> Turn around.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Now it's just one more thing.<eos> My tracking device.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I'm not stupid.<eos> I used it to track you here-<eos> - I'm not gonna let you do the same.<eos> Throw it away and toss over the box.
Teddy Frankle!<eos> FBI!<eos> Stay on him!<eos> FBI!<eos> Hands in the air, right now!<eos> Hands in the air, now!<eos> Put 'em up!<eos> Very slowly, remove your backpack.<eos> That's good.<eos> Put it on the ground.
It received commands through the Deep Web.<eos> Again, untraceable.<eos> I can see why this guy's not in custody.<eos> Every bit of evidence, whether it's physical or digital, runs right into a wall.<eos> Ran the search three times, Krummy.<eos> There aren't any hidden partitions.<eos> Just hit the damn enter key again, Nelson.<eos> It's not that hard.<eos> Look, I might be smaller, but I fight dirty.<eos> Now drop the attitude, before I take this laptop and break it over that watermelon you call a head.
I won it.<eos> I always loved the sweepstakes.<eos> And Dante and I would fill in these forms together when he was a kid.<eos> We always lost.<eos> But wouldn't you know it?<eos> A year after he disappeared,<eos> I finally won.<eos> A free computer with a yearly upgrade for life.<eos> Every January a new computer shows up.<eos> I plug it in, I turn it on and I leave it.
Isabel was a high-risk victim.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Here's this attractive young woman, living in a new town, missing her family back home.<eos> Her virtual sex play was an attempt to fill an emotional void that was created by geographic separation.<eos> Internet-enabled intimacy.<eos> Well, this very specific type of online risk-taking attracts a very specific type of deviant sexual predator.<eos> Think I know how to find our killer's computer.<eos> Because I can't find any of his digital dust in the WeDial network.<eos> Well, that's the beauty of this.<eos> We don't need to find it.
You know what?<eos> I'm going to buy this fryer so I can bring it to your house next year, when you host Thanksgiving.<eos> I want to buy it for you so this Thanksgiving will be great.<eos> Don't be silly. Let me.<eos> You have to be married to Steve.<eos> What a beautiful table.<eos> Honey's taking the bonnet off the gravy boat.<eos> What is she...<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> She's putting it on her thumb!
No way a cartel would leave a guy like that in charge of that much inventory.<eos> Now we finally have the evidence to prove it.<eos> CSU finally analyzed that blood residue from the photograph you took at the crime scene... check it out.<eos> There's two different kinds of footprints next to Castle's shoe.<eos> Acosta definitely had a partner aboard that ship.<eos> We need to find something solid to make Acosta roll.<eos> You know, I have his cell records.<eos> There was a flurry of phone calls to a burner cell right before the murder.<eos> Acosta could have been coordinating with his partner on board the ship.<eos> I'll get in touch with the cell provider, see if we can ping that burner phone so we can locate it.
I bet he was.<eos> When did he call you?<eos> Three weeks ago.<eos> On your cell phone?<eos> Yeah, he said he had to disappear for a while.<eos> Can I take that?<eos> That's a little forward of me.<eos> Let me... let me...<eos> Can I borrow your phone?<eos> I won't go through anything personal, I just, uh... bring it back in a couple hours, and maybe... I'll come back with one more of these.
This is a team now?<eos> You know, you haven't thought this through.<eos> You're worried about your career.<eos> I get it.<eos> But this is a good thing that we're doing.<eos> That's not what I mean.<eos> Should a power like this be in the hands of a couple of cops?<eos> Listen, I have thought this through.<eos> This is not like Precrime... we're not arresting people for something they haven't done.<eos> No, you're just seeing the future and keeping it a secret.
You won a battle, not the war.<eos> I took the dagger from you, and now you have nothing and never will.<eos> Watch it, pirate.<eos> There's the Rumplestiltskin we know and love!<eos> This is why Belle's left you, isn't it?<eos> She knows just what kind of man you really are.<eos> And what kind is that?<eos> The kind who loves his power more than anything... more than her, more than your dead son, which is why it's so bloody satisfying to take it away from you.<eos> Mmm, remember how good it felt?<eos> Power is only as good as the one who wields it.
Good, because we should all be scared.<eos> This is Death itself.<eos> - This is a fight we cannot win. - No.<eos> I'm not marked.<eos> I'm not going to give up.<eos> There has to be something we can do.<eos> You're right.<eos> There is something.<eos> Use this time wisely.<eos> Use it to say goodbye.
How long was that?<eos> Okay. Definitely something wrong with the security feed, because now it's just showing a random crowd<eos> Whatever they're watching, they sure seem to be enjoying it.<eos> They should probably tell some friends.<eos> I feel like we've known each other for years.<eos> Yeah. I know.<eos> I can't believe it was just 20 minutes ago that we met on Tinder<eos> Heeeeey-uh... Hahaha.. Kids Hahaha<eos> - Oh, just got a text from you.<eos> - You don't have to check it anymore.
Bingo!<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on. Who are you?<eos> Chief walt price speaking.<eos> It's detective cavanaugh here.<eos> I'm afraid I've got some bad news.<eos> That evidence I told you about?<eos> The scrapbook?<eos> It's gone missing.<eos> Babineaux must've gotten to it.
I don't even know why you need me there.<eos> I need you to be beautiful, charming, so be charming.<eos> Oh, I forgot my sunglasses.<eos> I could fall over in shock.<eos> Cool the car down for me.<eos> Whatever you say, Your Highness.<eos> ♪ We can go anywhere ♪ Where the hell...<eos> Babe, where'd you put my phone?<eos> Why would I move your phone?<eos> I can't find it.

You know, if you go, you can't come back.<eos> Is that really the life you want?<eos> It's not just my life I have to think about anymore.<eos> Wait.<eos> Are you...<eos> Some women buy a crib.<eos> Some paint the nursery.<eos> Me?<eos> I take out a hit on my husband.<eos> I take it Ray doesn't know.
You also might want to step inside.<eos> Weirdness wave!<eos> Abuelita, a tidal wave of madness just went over us.<eos> Oh, Soos, such an imagination.<eos> Ah! You turned into a chair!<eos> Why don't you have a seat and relax?<eos> What about you, and my friends?<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> You go help the others.<eos> When the universe is broken, only one handyman can fix it.
he became disillusioned with the world.<eos> Though constantly showered with praise for the subtlety of his mind none of his ideas or theories ever received even the slightest support from the scientific community.<eos> We should not be striving to advance human civilization but rather the artificial evolution of humans as a species.<eos> That was the only dream he had ever had but not a single person came forward to help him fulfill that dream.<eos> Damn these apes!<eos> Dangerous ideas?" Writing about me as if I were some freak?<eos> Do they really think humans have come this far by avoiding risks?<eos> Idiots who think they no longer need to evolve have no right to pass on their genes!<eos> this plan was always for my own sake.<eos> I will carry it out... even if I must do it all myself!
Flip a coin?<eos> How you doing?<eos> Not good.<eos> Uh, not good at all.<eos> I'm gonna give you a shot.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Your arm.<eos> Thank God.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I'm gonna need to see it, okay?
I promised his mother he'd be okay.<eos> I don't feel like I'm keeping my promise.<eos> Part of learning this job is learning where it ends.<eos> Injection didn't work on Casanova.<eos> He's still, uh... Locked and loaded.<eos> I'll be back to check on you.<eos> If the shot of terbutaline failed, the next step is a shot of phenylephrine.<eos> How about I just give him a shot of jaeger and some magazines?<eos> Dr. Savetti, I'm sensing you don't like the Rick Biddenger case.<eos> Would you prefer to pass it off to another resident?
He's, uh, trying to assist.<eos> This is a big guess, but he's got a fever in the 103 region, and the breathing, it's staccato, it's shallower than before, indicating a decline.<eos> Happy.<eos> His wallet.<eos> Did he have blood on his pants before?<eos> I didn't look that close.<eos> Scissors?<eos> Kitchen's have moisture and protein.<eos> It's a perfect place to grow a fungus.<eos> And if he's serving food, he could spread it all over the hospital.
Gold is a natural fungicide, but once it's removed from the soil...<eos> Why the hell is it more dangerous?<eos> Okay, ancient Meliola is much stronger and more resilient than what we see nowadays.<eos> So it would react very dangerously to a modern fungicide.<eos> Uh, then we have a serious problem, because they're spraying the infectious disease ward with a fungicide right now.<eos> Doctor, that is not a Stachybotrys fungus, it is Meliola.<eos> WALTER:<eos> How are you getting on this P.A.?<eos> This is a fungus unlike anything that you've seen before.<eos> It is far more resilient, and the fungicide will not kill it.
How do we get Sylvester's bacteria out of the hospital?<eos> The place is locked down until the CDC gets here.<eos> Nothing in or out.<eos> The sewage system extends from the hospital to the street.<eos> But retrieving something from the sewer makes me feel ill inside.<eos> Okay, so Megan's floor has a fire hose by room 233 that must connect to a network of standpipes.<eos> Now, if Cabe and Ralph can create a vacuum at that extraction point, then we can turn it into a pneumatic tube system, like in a bank.<eos> I've just hacked the county assessor's blueprints, and you can access the other end of the standpipe from an alleyway on the south side of the hospital.<eos> There's no exit, so there shouldn't be a police barricade.<eos> With the suction, we can retrieve the sample, grow the cure in the garage with a high-protein liquid, and then bring it back to the hospital for the CDC to distribute.
(crowd cheering)<eos> (bell clangs) ANNOUNCER:<eos> The fighters charge into the center of the ring, as we begin the fourth round.<eos> One thing is for certain:<eos> Luke Nakano has shown tremendous heart.<eos> There is no quit in this kid.<eos> But heart alone doesn't win fights.<eos> All right, Abby, I need you to find the control room, get up on the cameras, see if you can get eyes on Gabriel's people.<eos> Chin, I need you up top, all right?<eos> If there was a long gun in that bag they carried in here, they're gonna be looking for a sniper's perch, and we need to find it.
You should see Delarosa on your right.<eos> I got him.<eos> (bell clangs)<eos> (toilet flushes)<eos> (crowd cheering, punches landing)<eos> ANNOUNCER:<eos> Haynes misses with a combination.<eos> Nakano lands a big right hook!<eos> Get your hand off that pistol.<eos> Get your hand off that pistol and drop it right here, right now.
I mean, this guy's a bad man.<eos> With the rap sheet like that, why resurface to steal a heart?<eos> Ready for this?<eos> FBI's medical dossier on Dolan says he was diagnosed with a heart condition three years ago.<eos> Want to know the blood type?<eos> HH.<eos> Same as PinZ0's.<eos> Thomas Dolan stole the heart for himself.<eos> Thomas Dolan pays IT specialist Walton to tip him off when a heart becomes available.<eos> Hires Conroy to steal it.
I been poking around your code.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.<eos> After you hacked my server, Rain Boy, you lost the right to can and can't.<eos> Now, about your algorithm.<eos> If you throw in a set variance key, you might cut your trace time in half.<eos> Believe me I've considered it, but that would take another year or two, which I don't have.<eos> Might not have.<eos> Three months and an HH blood type?<eos> That was the only heart, and even if you recover it, the odds of it still being viable are...
The university attorney is on his way to get your search warrants tossed.<eos> Those students will be back on campus within the hour.<eos> I'm not here for your crew team.<eos> I'm here for you.<eos> I know that you're SOT515.<eos> I'm afraid I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> I think you do.<eos> Your precious crew team came to you with a problem:<eos> someone was accusing them of rape on the Miafina Web site.<eos> They claimed they didn't do it, of course, but this silly girl was threatening to make up a story that they did.
Bring me back to life.<eos> There are suitors eager to court you.<eos> You need funds to protect Scotland.<eos> - I'm just not ready to marry another man.<eos> - You have to be.<eos> Don't go back to Scotland.<eos> Court Don Carlos.<eos> Show Spain that you will always have power as long as you are aligned with France.<eos> Find my favorite portrait.<eos> Send it to Don Carlos with a message.
That is... a rather odd request.<eos> But Mary, he would have no idea that a game like that...<eos> Where men hunt women like prey.<eos> Ending with?<eos> A kiss.<eos> It's a chasing game.<eos> A game, nothing more.<eos> - You're right.<eos> - I think what he also seeks is some certainty that you will try, if only for a day, to let your grief over Francis pass.<eos> To give him a chance to warm your heart, if not to win it.
Melissa!<eos> Am I right?<eos> What about Melissa?<eos> "What about Melissa?"<eos> Come on, she's being as stubborn as a mule who refuses to reproduce.<eos> Yeah, I think I'm gonna have to side with Melissa on this one.<eos> My sister had kids, and it turned her nether regions into a real war zone.<eos> Her boobs were like coin purses.<eos> Well, who doesn't love a good coin purse?<eos> Put it in your hand and feel all those coins?
Can... you see?<eos> How many do you remember?<eos> You heard the names.<eos> How many do you remember?<eos> Melendez, Gianelli, Santos...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Can you try to remember more?<eos> No, it's just one big... jumble.<eos> I also heard a number.<eos> "99." You kept repeating it.
Of course you were.<eos> It's okay.<eos> He was easy to lose.<eos> Excuse me, Stretch.<eos> What about Memento Mori?<eos> The feds are scrubbing Gray's memories for clues, but it's a shot in the dark.<eos> You still seeing an empty park?<eos> Maybe if we could get to Wally's and upload my vision...?<eos> No, it's too risky.<eos> Blomfeld is probably surveilling it.
She couldn't defend herself.<eos> Anna had taken ecstasy an hour before her death.<eos> She didn't ﬁnd it by the river.<eos> If you mean that Anna didn't leave home just to take a walk on the quay, I was going to get to that.<eos> She sneaked out of the house because she wanted to go somewhere.<eos> A party or a nightclub, in order to meet someone.<eos> Her phone would have told us who if we had found it.<eos> That is right, Captain.<eos> The murderer took it so he wouldn't be identiﬁed.<eos> The operator could help us ﬁnd it.
Just a couple of questions.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Excuse me!<eos> I don't want people to touch my instrument.<eos> - ls that a glass mouthpiece?<eos> - It's not glass.<eos> It's crystal.<eos> It must be fragile.<eos> Very.<eos> I've just changed it.
I mean it.<eos> And I swear if you tell Miss Violet your little bookmark gets flushed.<eos> All right are we ready?<eos> All right everybody first positions. Ephram?<eos> And plié.<eos> - I have to talk to you.<eos> - You can talk all you want.<eos> - I don't have to listen.<eos> - Just let me explain.<eos> What? Why your friends are total bitches or why you're with them in the first place?
First priority is rescuing the others.<eos> We can wait.<eos> Right.<eos> Gonna need a new plan.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> Crichton...<eos> Congratulations on retrieving the females.<eos> I assume they're alive and... intact.<eos> Of course, you can't set them free nor restore their size without my help.<eos> I understand you care for them.
Well, maybe I just want to see a professional at work.<eos> Is this the hardest part, or does that come later?<eos> You have no call trying to make me ashamed of my job.<eos> What I do is legal.<eos> And how's that smuggling coming?<eos> - My work's illegal, but at least it's honest.<eos> - What?<eos> Well, this-- the lie of it.<eos> That man parading you around on his arm as if he actually won you... as if he loves you, and everyone here going along with it.<eos> These people like me, and I like them.
-It's too late!<eos> -Wait!<eos> You can't leave.<eos> -I like you, but not that much.<eos> Poor Aresia.<eos> May the gods grant her peace at last.<eos> -How are you feeling?<eos> -Better.<eos> Good thing you were able to recover Aresia's notes from her hideout.<eos> Yes. Without them, we might never have found the antidote.
No! Back to the pit, you monster!<eos> Mother!<eos> I've got you!<eos> LORD HADES: Hippolyta!<eos> -What did you ever see in him?<eos> Ancient history.<eos> Thank Athena it's finally over.<eos> Is it?<eos> What about our Amazon sisters?<eos> Is there nothing we can do for them?
That's your virtual arrest. And this is your actual one.<eos> This is a mistake.<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> You stole a confidential police file.<eos> That's grand larceny.<eos> An overt act in furtherance of a conspiracy to commit murder.<eos> You see, one of my hobbies is studying the laws you were once paid to enforce.<eos> It's surprisingly cheap.<eos> Please, don't take my girls away from me!<eos> I did it for them.

We're gonna get a crane here and lower your fat ass down to the street.<eos> A crane?<eos> Oh, that's rich.<eos> But would you mind explaining to me how I'm supposed to have killed the bitch?<eos> I can't leave this room, remember?<eos> Well, my, my, my.<eos> It's the defective detective once more.<eos> Lay it on me, Einstein.<eos> These two chairs are from the judge's house.<eos> The killer stood on one of them when he turned off the smoke alarm.
I think they added a few songs.<eos> You wanna come?<eos> Oh, I think I'll be having a headache that night.<eos> To new friends.<eos> Well, I've been keeping dinner warm in the kitchen.<eos> Are you all right? Yes.<eos> Perfect.<eos> I love these dishes.<eos> They were my grandmother's.<eos> When I was four years old, she told me I could have them when she died.
I... Okay, here's the thing.<eos> I can remember when you began this sentence.<eos> Everyone gets lost. The house was always too big for Katherine and me.<eos> We didn't buy it.<eos> It was a wedding gift from her father.<eos> You understand, right?<eos> I mean, you lost your wife.<eos> Uh, understand what, sir?<eos> The natural desire to pack her things away.<eos> You don't want them around to...
Give emmett kleenex. Console debbie.<eos> You know she's going to be a mess.<eos> So you're standing me up to see two dykes tie the knot?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I guess i am.<eos> You angry? I think you're a selfish, heartless asshole.<eos> Keep up the good work.<eos> Friends, family,<eos> Welcome to the celebration of a loving, lifetime commitment Of melanie and lindsay.<eos> They've asked me to thank you for bearing witness To today's ceremony And to join them in recognizing it
- Wait.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - All right.<eos> It's not even 5:00.<eos> What is this?<eos> "If I ever feel lonely..."<eos> It was official.<eos> A new season had begun.<eos> Maybe our mistakes are what make our fate.<eos> Without them, what would shape our lives?
And I want all that, in addition to my friends.<eos> That sounds wonderful, but don't bank on it happening.<eos> You must be cold.<eos> I'll meet you at the hotel.<eos> I'm going to get some saltwater taffy.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Yeah, I'm dying for it.<eos> Watch the tram car, please.<eos> By my fifth piece of peppermint taffy, I realized... maybe I wasn't banking on my friends.<eos> I was hiding in them.
Do you know what it feels like to be hit by a 2000-pound car?<eos> Hey, Lex, what are you doing here so late?<eos> Came to talk to your parents about the settlement.<eos> What are you reading?<eos> Men are From Mars, Women are From Venus?<eos> I'm trying to get an insight into the female psyche.<eos> I seriously doubt you'll find it in here.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> I've got these two amazing friends who both happen to be girls.<eos> For argument's sake, let's call them Lana and Chloe.
So how is everything?<eos> How's your dad?<eos> Not so good.<eos> But I get the pictures from the housewarm finally.<eos> Good, bring them next time.<eos> I wil.<eos> There's a pretty one of you.<eos> That's sweet.<eos> I don't see the glasses, Fur'.<eos> That's okay, I probably leave them home.
We're both family planning doctors.<eos> - When was the last letter?<eos> - This morning.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> Be nice to know a little more, Tom.<eos> I don't know what it's like down in London these days, but up here, we like to think we're all on the same side.<eos> Right now, this is need to know, Keith.<eos> Look, I just want to get those bastards. Alright?<eos> Twenty bombs arrived in Liverpool last night.<eos> That was one of them.
- You halted the transfer of the device?<eos> - Yes, and we've learned more.<eos> I think I've translated enough of the writings to figure out its purpose.<eos> It's broadcasting energy particles.<eos> We're not sure, but we think they're triggering an ability to see the creatures.<eos> Hopefully, only those exposed to the particles will develop this second sight.<eos> None of the ciphers we have fit perfectly, but, as I understand it, the device is meant to allow us to observe beings that exist in a parallel dimension.<eos> We think the energy particles create a bleed-through effect, causing anyone exposed to them to see into this parallel dimension.<eos> We can't contain them because they aren't here?<eos> They do exist, just not in any way that allows us to interact with them.
And Roosevelt said the U.S. would produce 50,000 planes in the next four years.<eos> Everyone thought it was a joke.<eos> And it was, because it turned out we produced 100,000 planes.<eos> Gave the Air Force an armada that would block the sun.<eos> Do you still have what you wrote that night?<eos> - About curing cancer?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Read it to me.<eos> "Over the past half-century, we've split the atom we've spliced the gene and we've roamed Tranquility Base.<eos> We've reached for the stars and never have we been closer to having them.
It wasn't the assailant Emily recognized, it was Brad.<eos> - Then how do they know each other?<eos> - I'm working on it.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Looks like our little Good Samaritan is on the run.<eos> Go get him.<eos> We believe there were two people involved.<eos> One of them may have got cold feet.
No!<eos> You just don't want my opinion!<eos> How about with the couch?<eos> I picked out that really cool one with the three pop-up footrests.<eos> That thing was atrocious.<eos> It was perhaps the best couch ever.<eos> So that's your idea of decision-making,<eos> A dog named "Floppy" and unlimited footrests?<eos> Not a bad start.<eos> I think you're forgetting that I already let you make decisions, and then you proceeded to screw them up!
You want to hear it?<eos> Evolution tends to eliminate, or at least, uh... Subjugate emotion.<eos> The limbic brain is still down there.<eos> But it's way... Down... under.<eos> Why we don't run through the streets killing people... At least most of us.<eos> Imagine their abilities combined with the energy of our strong emotion.<eos> They'd be cherry bombs... she'd be a nuclear explosion.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you White Shadow.<eos> White Shadow comes to us after spending the last three years jumping through a flaming hoop at a sea show in Florida.<eos> Hopefully, over time, as we come to know and understand these creatures a little better, we'll become more caring and compassionate in our behaviour towards them.
Usually one starts at the beginning... but I decided to start at the end fortwo reasons:<eos> The first is that as I came back to be the author... more than a writer who is dead, I am a dead man who is a writer... for whom the grave was a second cradle.<eos> The second is that by doing so, it gets more innovative and modern.<eos> Moses, who also recounted his story in the Bible... began with his birth, not his death.<eos> This, in fact, is a radical difference between my story and the Bible.<eos> Nature seems to weep at the loss... of one of its finest characters.<eos> Iwas 64 and had had a full life. Iwas single and rich.<eos> To the good friend you see giving my eulogy... I left a goodly sum. I don´t regret it.<eos> ...all of this is sublime praise for our illustrious departed.<eos> Just a few People witnessed my departure... among them a lady.
And the authorities here could do nothing?<eos> After all there was no crime.<eos> She was my wife.<eos> She just took what I had given her.<eos> Your money.<eos> And your love.<eos> And you did not suspect?<eos> It seems that I know a lot less about women than I thought I did.<eos> And I know too much.<eos> Consequently, I've not much use for them apart from the necessities.
The mother and the two children.<eos> Quite interesting, don't you think?<eos> Interesting?<eos> I was scared out of my wits!<eos> Darling, calm down.<eos> So far we have handled this your way.<eos> But now you listen to me.<eos> We can't possibly stay in this house any longer.<eos> It is quite clear that these "beings" do not want us to live here.<eos> - We don't know about them yet.
Are you being watched?<eos> He's there to protect me.<eos> Alone with you, God knows what could happen.<eos> Let's go inside. Our priest might catch cold.<eos> Good evening, sir.<eos> - You're in love.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I do.<eos> The cards?<eos> I've never needed them for you.
Why don't they ask me to stay in the village and have a feast?<eos> - Can we talk for a sec? - Sure.<eos> Okay, yeah, I'm going to split, guys.<eos> Lars, I'll tell you what. I'm gonna talk to the director, and I'm gonna have him tweak that whole section.<eos> - It'll be fine. It'll be fine.<eos> - Tell him about the feast.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - I lost my keys yesterday.<eos> Oh, that's a drag.<eos> And I've just found them in the freezer.
You mind discussing it?<eos> - What?<eos> - The reason you were kept on.<eos> No, why would I mind?<eos> Wait.<eos> Are you sure you know the reason?<eos> They figured I wasn't such a lousy accountant!<eos> You don't know about the photos?<eos> What photos?<eos> I shouldn't discuss it, but everyone's seen them.
Everything that I loved and cherished was gone.<eos> I thought there was nothing more that could be taken from me.<eos> How wrong I was.<eos> But at Camelot, it seemed that high summer had come to Britain at last.<eos> Under the rule of a good, brave man, with the Knights of the ound Table our beleaguered country was at peace.<eos> Arthur was the High King everyone had hoped for and Guinevere, his queen.<eos> I've missed you, my love.<eos> Are you ill?<eos> My courses have come on me again.<eos> Why do you let them distress you so?
Porn is dead.<eos> Jokes are.<eos> All the dogs go in this job.<eos> It's my cool and make you're mad.<eos> In two months one to one and wipe away.<eos> - What to do?<eos> - A stretch.<eos> We're gonna go to Mexico or elsewhere.<eos> I have sand...<eos> Mexico is a place where are whales and when you wave them swim with you.
How are you?<eos> - Hi, Julio.<eos> - Hi, mom. - Honey!<eos> What's up, kids?<eos> You look weird.<eos> Are you a bit sad?<eos> It's for the girls, right?<eos> Come on, boys!<eos> Love has upset you all!<eos> Think of them, and you'll be with them.
Julio and Tenoch told her many other tales.<eos> Each story proved the strong ties ...that joined them, they were like one.<eos> The stories, although enriched with personal mythology, were true.<eos> But like it always happens, they were incomplete truths.<eos> Julio didn't say that he used to light matches to cover the smell in the toilet ...in Tenoch's house nor Tenoch revealed that he used to lift the toilet cover with his foot at Julio's.<eos> - Do you have girlfriends?<eos> - Yes, Ceci.<eos> - Ana Bananas.<eos> - Bananas?<eos> And where are them?
Lucky man.<eos> No, that's you, remember?<eos> Please, come, come.<eos> Please, look at it.<eos> Look at the girls.<eos> Take your pick.<eos> Your first choice, Raysy.<eos> Just don't pick the one with the big bristols on the right.<eos> They're laughing, Jack.<eos> What do you want them to do, cry?
I'll catch you up.<eos> - All right.<eos> Sit there and take it easy.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> I think the Black Prince is here somewhere.<eos> Whatever you say, Big Boy.<eos> I mean, there's only me to consider now, ain't there?<eos> Yeah, now all your women have run off to places named "Syd" something or other.<eos> Well, with them gone, I don't need it, do I?
It's tamarind-glazed lamb on cumin cabbage with a tangerine salsa.<eos> The lamb is French-South American, the cabbage is pure Mexican... and the salsa is Caribbean.<eos> What will they call this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Dad calls my dishes "mutts."<eos> "Nuevo Latino."<eos> I like that.<eos> I bet if your dad would just try it, he would definitely be sold.<eos> When I was little, he used to bake me bracelets out of cookie dough.<eos> Then he'd make rings and paint them with colored sugar to make them sparkle.
The mechanism of the human brain is amazing and mysterious<eos> Out of hundreds of millions of brain cells Human could only exercise less than ten percent of them.
Haven't you ever felt like I feel now?<eos> You have to live it to understand.<eos> - Why are you in your underwear?<eos> - Do you want me to go?<eos> - Yes! - Okay, I'll go!<eos> I go!<eos> "During this time, women must take a hard look at their emotions..."<eos> "upsets, and worries. Seen from outside, they can seem disproportionate".<eos> "Speaking of them to someone is a way of exorcizing fears"<eos> "or at least not allowing them to become overwhelming".
And where is the bouys' room?<eos> I've been briefed buy the Governor - General on what concerns, what anticipations.<eos> That is private.<eos> We will all discover what new concepts our SS friends have in mind.<eos> Schöngarth!<eos> Not bad for French.<eos> Neumann, Director, Office of the Four - Year Plan. I'm veruy pleased to be here.<eos> Whom mauy I be speaking to?<eos> It is veruy complex, these laws.<eos> A lot of time and thought have been put to them, and some of these here uyou notice all the SS have little idea what is lawful and no respect for what theuy do know.
Okay.<eos> An umbrella.<eos> Do it again. Do it again.<eos> - All right.<eos> What would you like?<eos> - Do an octopus.<eos> You don't talk much, do you?<eos> I can't talk to you about my work, Alicia.<eos> I don't mean work.<eos> I find that polishing my interactions in order to make them sociable requires a tremendous effort.
It is not bad.<eos> Decide which arm and roll up your sleeve.<eos> Your arm is very skinny kid.<eos> I'm gonna be late to school.<eos> And what grade you are?<eos> Eighth grade.<eos> You'll have all the chicks fighting for you when they see this.<eos> He does not like girls.<eos> Not true, Nathan?<eos> I like them just fine!
A sort of stillness that really added dignity to the ending.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> It's like, people don't just disappear.<eos> July 27.<eos> You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?<eos> Robert?<eos> These close-up comments at the end of the scene were added very late in the day.<eos> Just a couple of lines.<eos> The lines were originally delivered by Jeff out to the skyline of New York but we brought him round to face Kevin, which I think was a really good addition.<eos> Another little touch that was added later on was, Jeff actually used to just look at the glasses, but I like that he comes down and looks through them wondering what the world really does look like through Prot's glasses.
For tonight at least.<eos> The war will be over when we live normally.<eos> With a man for you and a woman for me.<eos> No man will ever want me!<eos> Don't say that...<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> You'll find someone,<eos> I'm sure of that.<eos> Women are different.<eos> Different things matter for them.
As good as that.<eos> Stanley's expectations of people were not really, really high.<eos> You see it in his films.<eos> There was human beings he loved.<eos> Christiane was the love of his life.<eos> He would talk about her with-<eos> - He adored her.<eos> That's something people didn't know.<eos> His daughters, adored them.<eos> I'd see that because he would talk to me about them, very proudly.
Do you really have to go back to London?<eos> I am afraid so, Raymond.<eos> When you're ruined, there's so much to do.<eos> Yes, there is, isn't there?<eos> Would anybody care for a game of bridge after dinner?<eos> Oh, yes, I wouldn't mind.<eos> Who else? Louisa, how about you?<eos> Oh, I don't think so.<eos> I've rather gone off cards.<eos> I've never been very lucky with them.
I will have to take it through to where it is... that deep sense of water that's transformative... that's mysterious, that's even down to the river Styx.<eos> Larry Jordon and I were invited to go to Geoffrey Holder's wedding... when he was in the Flower Drum Song by John Latouche... a big Broadway hit of the time.<eos> And they had a big wedding out on Long Island... and the P.R. people wanted to make a lot of advertisement out of it.<eos> And Holder had invited her as a priestess... to come and make it a Haitian wedding.<eos> By the time we arrived, they had shambled her aside... and given her a small room and were not allowing her... to put up the Vodoun ritual things, and she went into a rage.<eos> This is what would be called a holy rage... and it did have the effect of something that a lot of people don't believe I saw... but I saw it with my own eyes.<eos> She went into the kitchen... and she took a refrigerator... and she hurled it from one corner of that kitchen to the other.<eos> Now, you know, I've tried to say, well, how could such a small woman...<eos> Maya of all people, lift up a refrigerator?<eos> Well, these are people that forget mothers have lifted up automobiles... to get them off of their children.
Are you certain he's telling the truth?<eos> Absolutely certain.<eos> The drugs are working.<eos> Keep him alive while I'm gone.<eos> As soon as we've tied down, we'll be descending into the trade complex.<eos> It has 36 levels.<eos> Your translators have been programmed for Rigelian.<eos> However, you'll encounter numerous other species.<eos> Many of them are known to be impatient with newcomers.<eos> None of them have seen a human before.
Are you going to hold this gate all by yourself?<eos> Demonstrations are forbidden during Celebration Week.<eos> Please disperse immediately.<eos> Sorry, we can't do that.<eos> Our time has come.<eos> Why must humanity settle matters by resorting to violence?<eos> Yes, we all know that.<eos> I agree it is a problem. It's our emotions.<eos> They vibrate, and all we can do is move forward within that amplitude.<eos> But without affirming them, we can't survive.
Ten boys stood here... and ten girls opposite... all about 9 or 1 0 years old.<eos> So my eyes went like this.<eos> -could you see the pretty girls?<eos> -perfectly well.<eos> Yes, when looking at women, my sight works all right.<eos> I can see a little better.<eos> But the distance was from here to where you are now.<eos> I know that when I Iook at people... they never know who I'm looking at.<eos> That was an advantage... to be looking at one of those girls, because they were all pretty... but we always like one more than the others.<eos> I had my eye on one of them, but my eyes never settle on anyone.
How come this wasn't in the book?<eos> How come it wasn't in the book.<eos> Good question.<eos> I don't know why we didn't put it in the book.<eos> This was really getting annoying.<eos> He didn't follow up on the most interesting part of the story.. and he didn't mention the fact about the credit cards until now?<eos> One more remark like that and it's all over for Markoff.<eos> Look how many people are standing here and not one person took my brochure.<eos> Look at all these people.<eos> Not one of them took this.
Forgive me, Your Majesty, I suffer from acid reflux.<eos> Acid reflux is a curse.<eos> I only get it when I'm nervous.<eos> It affects my voice.<eos> It's horrible.<eos> -Miss Otoms--<eos> -Claire.<eos> Isn't she lovely?<eos> Claire, you're suing the phone companies.<eos> Many of them, in fact.
I don't know.<eos> This is not what I was expecting.<eos> Hold that thought.<eos> MisterProfit,timefor yourQuantumrun.<eos> Well, Quantum waits for no man.<eos> I've got to get back to the office.<eos> By the way, you look a little tense.<eos> I hear Rutger has great hands.<eos> Oh yeah?<eos> What's so great about them?
I guess we should have known if our guy was planting hairs he was planting semen.<eos> Yeah. Probably in little hollowed-out packets of ketchup.<eos> I didn't really find anything instructive but Warrick hit pay dirt.<eos> Well, I went to Audrey Hayes' apartment and I paid particular attention to the point of entry.<eos> I found a small persistence of white cotton fibers.<eos> Could have been his staging area.<eos> Maybe he... wears his murder kit.<eos> Well, I remember what you said about signature guys and how they have low self-esteem-- they're always going to the gym to work out-- so I'm thinking gym towels.<eos> SIDLE: The "Frequented Locations" report said none of the women belong to a gym where he could have spotted them.<eos> I went back to see if any of them had tried out introductory offers.
No more spells.<eos> Piper, honey, it's us.<eos> It's your sisters.<eos> I don't have sisters.<eos> Go away!<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> You're too late.<eos> Her nightmare's about to end.<eos> Keep them here.<eos> I want them to witness this.
I'm not going to tell you what my powers are.<eos> I can't figure out if you're stubborn or stupid.<eos> If I can't fight him, he's going to kill us.<eos> He's looking for me.<eos> I can feel him. He's getting close.<eos> Well, get out of my body, and I'll help you fight him.<eos> I can't survive without a body, and I'd much rather your soul die than mine.<eos> My sisters will figure out what you've done and...<eos> And what? What do you plan to do? Wave to them from the mirror?<eos> You're nothing but my reflection to them.
And he had this wild hair and these intense, bulging eyes, and he said he was gonna come back.<eos> All right. Look in the Book of Shadows for a vanquish, and I'll pick up Phoebe. We'll meet you at the house, okay?<eos> Okay, but hurry. Because he could come back any minute.<eos> All right, bye.<eos> Where's the Book?<eos> You just made a big mistake calling my sisters home.<eos> Is that what you think?<eos> - That is what I know.<eos> - Well, here's what I think.<eos> When your precious sisters come home, I'll kill you and possess one of them.
Phoebe, would you just get out of here?<eos> I found it. Okay, I'm going now.<eos> Out of here, found the gloss.<eos> Watch out for the...<eos> I'm okay.<eos> - Hey, you guys.<eos> - Hey, Prue.<eos> Are you lost?<eos> No, but my keys are.<eos> Have you seen them?
Be careful not to lose each other.<eos> Take care, and blessed be.<eos> Damn wind keeps blowing out my candles.<eos> I'm sorry, Patty, I got cut off.<eos> Oh, now...<eos> It's just what troubles me about your daughters is not where they came from, it's where they're going.<eos> It's just a phase.<eos> When their destiny is revealed, they'll come together.<eos> But what if they don't? What if they never do?<eos> And what if the gift is too much for them to handle, and they?
Steve?<eos> Yes, Sally<eos> You're Standing right behind me, aren't you?<eos> I'm more than usually certain of that<eos> I'm going to pick up this towel<eos> You're going to look the other way.<eos> Clear?<eos> Yes, yes, good idea<eos> I'm really sorry about this, um...<eos> I was just looking for my keys, I thought I might have left them here
You've had threesomes?<eos> That's fantastic.<eos> Sex with two complete women.<eos> That's totally brilliant!<eos> Okay, Jeff...<eos> calm, focus, breathe.<eos> Steve, sex with two whole women.<eos> Think of the advantages. They can't both fall asleep.<eos> Right.<eos> And if one of them suddenly leaves or punches you, You still got one left.
Why can't you...<eos> Because I don't think 17-year-old girls with no costume on...<eos> - You shouldn't be allowed...<eos> - Who cares?<eos> They were just using Halloween to get candy!<eos> Who cares?<eos> It's Halloween, just give them candy.<eos> You just use the holiday for your own selfish purposes?<eos> So what?<eos> So you'd rather have them toilet-paper your house?
Especially in the summer when all you smell is dead flesh.<eos> - That's the slaughterhouse district. - It's still a good deal.<eos> You know, first you live in a boat, then a hotel, and now a meat plant.<eos> - What's next? Tree house?<eos> - You're not a morning person, are you?<eos> Hey, boy.<eos> - Nice toga. - Yeah.<eos> I seem to have lost my clothes.<eos> Your pants are on the couch.<eos> And Norman had your socks, so I put them in your shoes.
All the Taelons who are, or ever have been, now sit in judgement.<eos> We leave it to the communality.<eos> Arrest him!<eos> Go!<eos> Reassure the embassador will take his opinion under advisement<eos> - Where's Kincaid?<eos> - At the embassy, he won't leave Da'an.<eos> The A.N.A is literally to come apart of the seams they're afraid of some sort of Taelon civil war.<eos> I'm flooded with urgent opinions.<eos> Half of them either don't trust Zo'or or the other half don't trust Da'an.
What if we don't have a way to measure it yet but it's somehow killing us.<eos> Portals, data streams...<eos> I'm on that mothership twice a week.<eos> I've commumed with Da'an, carry these energy inside me maybe that why I can't have children anymore.<eos> I don't know...<eos> Renée.<eos> I don't know... but I read a paper in the "American journal of medecine".<eos> There may be, and I stress "may"... be a trend for new infertility spikes in some major US cities.<eos> - But we can't assumed it.<eos> - Is D.C. one of them?
- See ya.<eos> - That was kinda cool. - Yeah.<eos> I'm bored.<eos> Wanna go push the janitor, knowing he can't legally push us back?<eos> - Sure! - OK, cool.<eos> Let's go do it.<eos> Hey, Dad. Look at these little bananas.<eos> Why, you smug little bastard! Peter!<eos> Chris, these are plantains.<eos> And there's nothing wrong with them.
- It different kind of politician.<eos> Not beltway insider.<eos> Fem-puter, we bring offering of bath beads and scented soaps.<eos> Your gift pleases Fem-puter.<eos> Why are there men on her planet? !<eos> - It was an accident.<eos> - That does not fem-pute.<eos> Fem-puter will return after deciding your punishment!<eos> I'm through making fun of women.<eos> I want them to help me.
Sure.<eos> We certainly don't mind loaning Lorelai the money...<eos> - if that's what you're worried about.<eos> - Certainly not.<eos> Rory is first priority in this house.<eos> I'm not concerned about whether you mind or not.<eos> Loaning money is a dirty business.<eos> It's distasteful, and I don't care for it.<eos> As you know, I came into town... to check up on the family investments and to talk with our lawyers.<eos> I have some things to put in order... and one of them is setting up a trust fund for Rory.
How come alarms didn't go off when this Monet went out on the market?<eos> These were private sales. We never knew they were on the market. Here.<eos> Those the paintings on your list?<eos> They're all there.<eos> What's this list from?<eos> The manifest of a U-boat that sank in the North Sea in 1945.<eos> All your paintings were on board, presumably on their way to South America.<eos> What I don't understand is how could anyone recover these masterpieces from the bottom of the ocean?<eos> By painting them yourself.<eos> Maybe the paintings never made it on the sub. Maybe some Nazi SOB stored them in his attic.
- See ya.<eos> I didn't talk to her.<eos> Hey, Don Juan, you're under arrest.<eos> Let me make sure I haven't missed anything.<eos> There's no physical evidence of any kind at the crime scene or in his car.<eos> There's no fingerprints, no fibers, no witnesses to connect Mr. Talbott to any of the bodies.<eos> There's no evidence of contact between Mr. Talbott and any of these girls that cannot be explained away by a professional relationship.<eos> We have the kid who used to work for him.<eos> Besides the fact his own conduct is questionable, he can offer no evidence that Talbott was sleeping with the victims, let alone murdered them.<eos> We know he defrauded two of them.
- Don't drag me into this!<eos> - Ah, you got small hands, too.<eos> - Isn't that the giveaway? - Ohh.<eos> You've always felt inadequate.<eos> That's why you're always screwing around. - You couldn't hack it with the big law firms, you couldn't "measure" up-- whoops-- to your peers...<eos> That's not true.<eos> That's not true.<eos> ...while these women, they made you feel powerful.<eos> You could dominate them.<eos> But one of them, what, wanted something more from you?
We don't supply an answer, our whole case looks suspect.<eos> If they are involved... Tess and Jodie are not gonna be very forthcoming with a motive.<eos> But I know someone who might.<eos> Kelly and Tess didn't get along very well at first.<eos> In fact, Tess tried to get Kelly dinged during pledge week.<eos> "Dinged"?<eos> Rejected by the membership.<eos> Why?<eos> Look, Dana, I understand that your sisters are pressuring you... but your friend was drugged and raped.<eos> Now you need to decide what's more important... living with them, or living with yourself.
Tommy Dowd was beaten. He would've been murdered if Gregory Moore hadn't filled in for him.<eos> I had nothing do with that.<eos> Ask your attorney to explain it to you.<eos> You set Dowd up, Moore was killed in his place.<eos> That makes you responsible.<eos> Tommy Dowd with his disfigured face should be a very compelling witness.<eos> He won't testify against me.<eos> Why do you think he agreed to wear a wire?<eos> He knew you were trying to kill him. I didn't try to kill anyone. It was just business.<eos> Leslie... These women don't know if someone loves them or their money. I provide companionship.
Oblongs, Oblongs<eos> Welcome, all, to the opening of firefly season.<eos> I've loved catching fireflies since I was no bigger than a finger puppet.<eos> Bob, we haven't had fireflies in the valley for ages.<eos> The air's too toxic for living things.<eos> But this year, we're supposed to get those new Africanized fireflies.<eos> They glow brighter, live longer, and six of them can kill a dog.
Are you going to apologise now? - Yes!<eos> S- s-s... sorry about that.<eos> You covered for it so well, as well.<eos> You were involved, but you covered.<eos> I don't want to be here when you bawl out Finchy.<eos> You won't be.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> Nor will you. So it's not offensive now it's Chris Finch?<eos> Let's not dwell on whether it is or isn't this or... Let's stop degrading women, please.<eos> Let's have a laugh with them, not at them.
Judy, I'm not allowed to talk about it.<eos> Because I'm not. If you could please respect that.<eos> Lily, I need you to come in here for a second.<eos> - How much do you know about it?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - What? Stop pretending. You know what I'm talking about.<eos> I don't know what you're doing. Whatever it is, I don't want to talk about it.<eos> For a little magazine, we have very good sources.<eos> You want to know why? I am relentless and driven.<eos> I make it easier for them to tell than to resist me.
Subtitles:<eos> Nathbot ~ bufgelfly ~<eos> Let me tell you about the women in my life.<eos> I'm beset by them.<eos> I'm undone by them.<eos> I'm in awe of them.<eos> I'm in love with them.
We didn't have a fight.<eos> She just pulls away from me at the weirdest times.<eos> Well, maybe she senses that you're pulling away so she just does it first.<eos> Maybe you should mind your own business.<eos> Shoot. I guess this means I can't ask about the pissing?<eos> Because I had an ex who wanted to pee on me, and I wasn't grossed out.<eos> I mean, I just thought it was kind of silly. But that's me.<eos> Thank you for taking me to the art gallery last night.<eos> I thought you hated those pictures.<eos> No, no, it's just that I don't like them, that's all.
- Yes! Francisco Franco!<eos> - Yes!<eos> I won! I won!<eos> And without a helpline.<eos> What have I won?<eos> How about another cup of coffee?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> So, you've got two daughters.<eos> - Yes, Riley and Chloe.<eos> - Do you have a picture of them?
I mean moon.<eos> It is not. My home world is called Chulak.<eos> Your world?<eos> Wait a second.<eos> How many places does the Stargate go? The Stargate network is composed of a great many worlds. - Are you serious?<eos> - Colonel O'Neill!<eos> - What?<eos> - It's Dr. Thompson.<eos> - Those things, they're attacking him. - Where?<eos> In the clearing where we first encountered them.
Uh, I wouldn't unpack just yet, if I were you.<eos> Not until after the party.<eos> You don't want people messing with your stuff.<eos> Oh, yeah, right.<eos> Which party is that?<eos> Our party.<eos> Did they not tell you?<eos> We're throwing a party tonight. Oh.<eos> This entire campus is heaving with beautiful women that don't know anyone yet.<eos> We want them to know us.
- What would you like?<eos> - I'm glad you asked.<eos> Not half as glad as I am.<eos> Current draft says forced prostitution, not other types, is sexual exploitation.<eos> What about someone who answers an ad for an au pair and ends up working in a whorehouse, where they're held hostage?<eos> That's not the worst-case scenario.<eos> Five days ago, four 13-year-old Thai girls hanged themselves in an abandoned house on Stonycrest Lane in Bethesda.<eos> Not halfway around the world, Bethesda.<eos> Sheets over windows, triple locks on doors no phones, handcuffs hanging off the bedposts.<eos> For the price of a toaster, their parents had sold them to work as babysitters.
- I still don't... - You are.<eos> Maya, you are the most important person in my life.<eos> - Look, I'm in a car.<eos> - I'm sorry you feel that way.<eos> - Is this the man I wanted to marry? This is who I am.<eos> Can you step on it?<eos> Eugenio Geronimo Valdez, you're under arrest.<eos> Put your hands behind your back.<eos> Izzy had so many thoughts, he said he had to store them in my empty head, where they'd be safe.<eos> If only I could let them out again.
Sean will never be anything but suspicious if I pitch up saying, "Hey, honey, I'm home."<eos> What wouldn't make him suspicious?<eos> That I needed him in some urgent way.<eos> Destitute, in serious trouble, the kind I couldn't possibly sort out myself.<eos> Serious trouble, Nyah is something I can always arrange.<eos> This transponder chip is completely untraceable.<eos> It transmits your location to a satellite which can be read by only this computer.<eos> We can then track you to within three feet anywhere.<eos> Since your arrest, I've been sending news bulletins to every law enforcement agency in the world.<eos> I know Sean Ambrose and I guarantee that after that airline crash he's monitoring every one of them.
Cold turkey... and he was using big-time.<eos> Just imagine, cold turkey.<eos> - I couldn't take it.<eos> - Me neither.<eos> I'm so scared of withdrawal.<eos> That's the scariest thing.<eos> Me too.<eos> You want these flowers?<eos> I have no money.<eos> - I'll give them to you cheap.
Have you got Lynch with you, lads?<eos> Check. We have him in our sights.<eos> Clothes on or off today?<eos> Fuck off.<eos> She's great.<eos> Say hello to your da.<eos> Go on. Found him.<eos> Is that them, huh?<eos> Is that the two sisters?<eos> Oh, that's them all right, boy.
One night, I will get the perfect photograph.<eos> Hi!<eos> You realise that,... .. in the eternity of space,...<eos> .. there's probably a planet out there, right,... .. just like this one,... .. where another you... .. is photographing back down towards us.<eos> I mean, essentially, you are photographing yourself in a parallel universe.<eos> Incredible.<eos> Yeah... There are infinite worlds out there, ya know?<eos> Where anything you want to happen... .. does happen.<eos> Richard, do you know something? Hm?<eos> This is just the kind of pretentious bullshit... .. Americans always say to French girls... so they can sleep with them.
"...in her arms and singing to it, tickling it, and the child was cooing with delight.<eos> "All the people around were looking on with tears in their eyes.<eos> "The father was holding the hand of a boy about 10 years old...<eos> "...and speaking to him softly.<eos> The boy was fighting his tears.<eos> "The father pointed to the sky, stroked the boy's head...<eos> "...seemed to explain something to him.<eos> "At that moment, the SS man at the pit shouted to his comrades.<eos> "The latter counted off about 30 persons and instructed them...<eos> "...to go behind the earth mound. "Among them was the family that I have mentioned.
"Time cannot break...<eos> the bird's wing from the bird."<eos> "The bird and wing together...<eos> go down, one feather."<eos> "No thing that ever flew..."<eos> "not the lark, not you..."<eos> "Can die as others do."<eos> What have I done to you?<eos> You ruined me for other women.<eos> I saved you for them.
There's something I wanna show you.<eos> - Oh, yeah. - Hey, party on!<eos> - So--<eos> - So. Here we are... again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And, you know, if you're not ready, I'll understand.<eos> Bobby. I am ready.<eos> - You are?<eos> I can't keep fighting these urges.<eos> I have to just give in to them... and let them flow.
I'm tracking an alien. He's here to have sex with our women.<eos> His penis hums.<eos> It sounds like that heater in our timeshare at Deer Valley.<eos> I'm not making this up! I'll prove everything!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You've done it again!<eos> It's always like this. You get obsessed with things.<eos> Anything to avoid intimacy!<eos> You lost your first wife to golf, your second because of other women!<eos> You were one of them.
I don't wanna be in a relationship with someone who's irresponsible.<eos> Yes, you do. I have been irresponsible my whole life!<eos> - Well, it's time you changed.<eos> - Why?<eos> You're getting old!<eos> I'm not getting old. These are laugh lines.<eos> Nothing is that funny.<eos> I don't understand. I thought you liked me the way I am.<eos> I do.<eos> But things change and you have to change with them.
As the Lusitanian horizon approaches, the rays of light are drowned out and the entire blaze of glory swallowed up...<eos> You will see one stripped by the infamy of government. Another one imprisoned and killed in a hospital. Still another isolated and silenced in a desert.<eos> The luckiest among them, the one who disappeared at sea, commands the winds to carry back home the words by which he takes leave of his country:<eos> "Ungrateful homeland,<eos> "you will never have my bones!"<eos> I am ecstatic to see Your Highness.<eos> How is your health?<eos> With the infirmities of age.<eos> Slight problems like sciatica and now my left eye which forces me to wear glasses for reading...<eos> Without them, I can't see clearly.

"She reminds me of my mother".<eos> That 's why I' m doing it.<eos> I'm doing it because my sister has had to work 16 hours each day... since she got here because her husband... can't pay the hospital bills, he doesn't have medical cover... like million other people in this fucking country... that is the richest in the world !<eos> I'm doing it because I had to pay Perez... two months of my wages and beg him for a job.<eos> I'm doing it because we have to feed those bastards... we wipe their asses, we get everything ready for them. We raise their children and they look right through us.<eos> Maybe I'll go to school too, some day.<eos> But what 's the point if you forget more than you learn?<eos> -I'm a friend of Gavin's.<eos> 0scar, you have to secure the fire exit, okay?<eos> Keep them unlocked.
And Bond made a fake one so he can get in the Scaramaga's hide-out.<eos> You're missing the point.<eos> The 3rd nipple was a sign of sexual virility.<eos> So maybe your penis doesn't make you an elephant man.<eos> Maybe it makes you a superman.<eos> I had learned something from Rod's groinular fixation.<eos> His horror was my horror too.<eos> It was everymen's horror.<eos> Deny we may, but we're all afraid of women.<eos> Every single one of them.
And no job.<eos> And speaks fluent Ebonics.<eos> "Reggie, how come you got three women?"<eos> "They like dick, Jerry."<eos> "Your mama like dick?"<eos> I wrote a movie and sold it to the studio. I'm real excited about it.<eos> "Last White Man on Earth."<eos> Don't look for a sequel. We catch him.<eos> Starring Diana Ross and Whoopi Goldberg.<eos> We beat them for about five minutes. "Where is he? We saw you with him."
All right, I'll call her.<eos> You're bringing her back to work?<eos> We need everybody.<eos> You got to rent Behind the Green Door, 'cause the trapeze scene is hot.<eos> Bobby, did you see the glasses on my desk?<eos> I saw them sitting there last night.<eos> - They ain't here.<eos> - I don't have them.<eos> The motherfucking broads!<eos> Maybe the girls borrowed them for the opera.
But now comes the really hard part.<eos> Keeping quiet.<eos> This will be the real test of your skills. Right here.<eos> You cannot say anything.<eos> Not to your parents... your friends, if you still have any.<eos> Not to your teachers.<eos> Not even to your priest.<eos> You can't.<eos> Benjamin Franklin said...<eos> "The only way three people can keep a secret... is if two of them are dead."
- He's a comparative shopper.<eos> - Look in the back of the car. It's full of hairpieces. We're not spies.<eos> We're only hairpiece salesmen.<eos> Give me the keys.<eos> If you're fucking lying--<eos> - Where did you get these ?<eos> - Wimbledon.<eos> Venice or Wimbledon ?<eos> Wimbledon.<eos> Some of them are to the nuns.
And then with some therapy I learned how to walk a straight line.<eos> And dance.<eos> -And dance!<eos> -And dance.<eos> Oh, man, you got moves better than Winky, I think.<eos> My great-grandfather Millbank, in 1875 began the Mayflower IKennel Club and Dog Show.<eos> It started small.<eos> He operated out of this house we're in this beautiful building, and this lovely room which grew and grew, and of course, nobody lives here anymore.<eos> But, it's our it's our place.<eos> And then my grandfather continued the tradition and really, I think what we're talking about is standards very, very specific, rigid, you could say but in this world where would we be without them, I think.
Two-minute break. It's important.<eos> Honey.<eos> Man, I don't know which is worse... you fucking with his food or his lady.<eos> Dickman Duncan.<eos> You my hero, man!<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Got a little jealous.<eos> Just not used to it.<eos> Earrings.<eos> You left them in the office.
"There's a frank and honest soul!"<eos> Your flattery will get you nowhere.<eos> - Your goodness warrants it.<eos> - Let's move on.<eos> First, may we agree on a small detail?<eos> Speak.<eos> I'm proud, but I'm poor.<eos> These qualities are hard to reconcile, but are doomed to go hand in hand, as in my case.<eos> And where are they leading?<eos> To a battle between them.
A pussyholic?<eos> When is the last time you had a shag?<eos> - When?<eos> - Doesn't deserve a reply. - When?<eos> - The other night.<eos> Thursday.<eos> You were on all night Thursday.<eos> I meant Wednesday.<eos> You don't know anything about women, do you?<eos> You're scared of them.
- When?<eos> - Doesn't deserve a reply. - When?<eos> - The other night.<eos> Thursday.<eos> You were on all night Thursday.<eos> I meant Wednesday.<eos> You don't know anything about women, do you?<eos> You're scared of them.<eos> Face it, we can't live without women.<eos> We need them.
The last time I danced was nine years ago. - On my brother's wedding. - I'm most honored then.<eos> I felt like flying.<eos> Me too, I felt like a phoenix rising from its ashes.<eos> Good night.<eos> Rosalba?<eos> Yes?<eos> Sunday is Eliseo's birthday. I'd be glad, if you joined us.<eos> I'd love to...<eos> - Vera, have you brought my boots?<eos> - I put them by the stove.
Saturday nights are Friday nights, part ll.<eos> Everyone is talking about last night, like it's a sequel.<eos> Except that everyone who died in part I dies again in part II.<eos> You don't go to bed with a girl and run out as soon as she falls asleep.<eos> I couldn't sleep.<eos> Why not?<eos> I can't sleep with girls.<eos> Can't you sleep with girls?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I can sleep with them, maybe, but I can't wake up with them.
Yeah. Cookers, cushions, club armchairs<eos> Weary wood chairs and TVsets, Worn-out couches just bend over,you're made over<eos> Street rehab and TVrap,yeah,yeah! Broken TVs<eos> I've seen lots ofTVs abandoned, and within a few minutes<eos> somebody was taking out the copper.<eos> It's the copper from the deflector coils.<eos> I looked at the magic screen thinking I began this film right after the eclipse shown on TV, continued while the countdown to Y2Kwas shown on TV,<eos> and ended the film on the 1 st of May...<eos> Other people take TVs home, hoping to repair them.<eos> I found 2 small chairs on the street and took them home.
Syed sahib, I don't know how I'm supposed to react!<eos> Why are you people afraid of the truth ... you, the inspector, the editor...<eos> Y.K. Singh... everyone is telling me to shut up!<eos> But why? And even if I were to shut up, what'd come out of it?<eos> Even Justice Harikrishna's report has been made public.<eos> But what use was it? We want to make peace!<eos> You want to start a fight?<eos> Peace will be Syed sahib, when every one stays within limits<eos> The truth is that the colors green and the saffron... are but parts of Hindustan's flag.<eos> None of them must try to color the entire flag.
Doug Morrell flew later higher-altitude missions over Ploesti.<eos> [Morrell] This mission could be 10 hours long, but the combat part is only about 10 minutes. Ten minutes is a long time.<eos> Try holding your breath.<eos> The Eyemo had a hand-crank wind on it, and it seemed like always when the most important thing happened, you're winding that thing, trying to get it going.<eos> I hated to reload up at 20,000 feet.<eos> Reloading up there, your fingers get a little cold.<eos> When you come into the target, they put up so much flak that the enemy fighters won't come in there.<eos> They'll get hit.<eos> Bomb spotting is when the bombs release.<eos> Then you follow them and pick up their hits.
Walking back to his jeep,<eos> I said, "May I ask you a question, sir?"<eos> He said, "Go ahead.<eos> I was a corporal."<eos> And I said,<eos> He said, "What do you mean?" I said, "We don't have arms.<eos> We just got the camera.<eos> "And if somebody's shooting at you, it's easier if you can shoot back, even if you don't hit them."<eos> He said, "I don't care if you got film in the camera.<eos> "I want those cameras there, and I want them there all the time. "Because in front of those cameras,
- The peasants burn their grain...<eos> - ... and are moving into the forest.<eos> They drive away their cattle.<eos> They run at us with pitchforks.<eos> By the devil, we'll teach them.<eos> Fall in! Quick march!<eos> Burn all the stores!<eos> Burn them!<eos> Don't let them fall into the hands of the demon foe!<eos> We'd sooner let them go to waste!
You!<eos> Administer first aid.<eos> Keep the captain stable until a medical team arrives.<eos> Twilight, do we still have control of the pods we haven't launched?<eos> - Yes, sir. - Good.<eos> Let's bring it.<eos> Marquez, can you target those pods to the fighter's position?<eos> They're not designed for warfare.<eos> Their explosive force would be negligible.<eos> - I don't need them to explode.
- You don't kill humans.<eos> You don't qualify.<eos> You set things in motion.<eos> Play your little games up here in your glass tower and innocent people die.<eos> And yet, I just can't seem to care.<eos> But you do.<eos> While you make threats and waste time, crashing through windows your girls are out painting the town red, red, red.<eos> - Where? - That would be telling.<eos> In any case, you should hurry.<eos> Lives hang in the balance, waiting for their champion to save them.
Fun little buggers.<eos> Big with the marrow-sucking.<eos> - l don't understand.<eos> - l'm not sure I do either.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.<eos> I was trying to hide.<eos> I didn't want you to see what I am.<eos> - Tara, what?<eos> - What do you mean, what you are?<eos> Demon. The women in our family have demon in them.
There's one thing you didn't explain in there.<eos> As soon as you dug Laura up why didn't she turn Chip in?<eos> Self-preservation.<eos> She rats on him, she rats on herself.<eos> So, did you have a good day at school?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Three friends made be birthday cards.<eos> They did? !<eos> Well, you have got some great friends.<eos> how come you didn't want to have a party with them?
The blood spatter has a void instead of one continuous line of spray.<eos> There's an interruption a space where something or someone comes between the blood coming off the body and the wall.<eos> Which means our assailant was here and... There was somebody else in this room.<eos> kate Armstrong is lying.<eos> Fruit juice, half ice.<eos> Thanks, Warrick.<eos> The guy said it was natural, that it wasn't a drug.<eos> I mean, jimsonweed is a plant.<eos> Most drugs derive from plants.<eos> That doesn't make them safe.
It's him, he's alive.<eos> - In the war.<eos> - War. - War.<eos> - Help.<eos> - Hang in there, partner.<eos> We'll get you back, then we'll punish those witches.<eos> No, cease-fire.<eos> Cooperation.<eos> Wait, you want us to work with the witches?<eos> Need them to free me.
What, is this some kind of a joke?<eos> If you think it is, then why are you still here?<eos> Because some part of you is hoping beyond hope that I just might be telling you the truth, that I can restore your youth.<eos> Just like I did for Gail Altman.<eos> Gail?<eos> Yes, Frank, it's really me.<eos> You forgot your...<eos> - What?<eos> - Three witches.<eos> You said you took care of them.
- Did you have fun?<eos> - It was a hoot.<eos> Thanks for the love potion.<eos> Worked wonders.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> - Do you think she's all right?<eos> - She looks all right so far.<eos> Well. I was wondering where you went off to.<eos> I had to get some herbs.<eos> I can't very well make my potions without them.
I don't think so.<eos> We probably have a better chance of looking in the Book of Shadows under "Anton" and seeing where he got the amulet in the first place.<eos> Yeah, good.<eos> You guys go check that out, and I'm just gonna run downstairs and grab something to eat.<eos> I'm starving.<eos> Okay, we'll meet you downstairs.<eos> Leo, wait.<eos> I want you to come with me to the retirement home.<eos> - What about your sisters?<eos> - I don't want them there.
Yeah, good.<eos> You guys go check that out, and I'm just gonna run downstairs and grab something to eat.<eos> I'm starving.<eos> Okay, we'll meet you downstairs.<eos> Leo, wait.<eos> I want you to come with me to the retirement home.<eos> - What about your sisters?<eos> - I don't want them there.<eos> If I don't find the amulet I'm gonna die, Leo.<eos> And I don't want them to see that.
And you can't keep pretending that it's not coming between us.<eos> You can't keep hiding from the truth.<eos> That wasn't so difficult, was it?<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Reminding you of your inner nature, Belthazor.<eos> One that would be in your best interest to reconnect with soon.<eos> - I won't let you down.<eos> - You already have.<eos> You vowed to destroy the witches.<eos> Instead you bedded one of them.
Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> I know how that feels.<eos> I never knew my mother.<eos> And my father left when I was really little.<eos> So we were raised by my grandmother.<eos> And she's not with us anymore.<eos> - But you still have your sisters.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And I thank God for them every day.<eos> I don't know what I would do if I lost them.
Yes.<eos> How did you satisfy yourself that it wasn't?<eos> I suctioned the irrigation saline and did not see any persistent CSF.<eos> Did you look?<eos> I can't operate without looking.<eos> Well, given that it was 10 to 6, that you were in a hurry the nurse simultaneously reminding you of your date-<eos> Objection.<eos> Can we get to a question, Bruce?<eos> Did you perform a complete and competent inspection of the field to ensure there were no CSF leaks?<eos> Sometimes leaks are so small you cannot detect them visually.
I hurt my foot.<eos> If you come out here, I can take a look at it.<eos> I'm a doctor.<eos> Okay. Let's take a look.<eos> Are you a patient here?<eos> Let me see this.<eos> Hey, you're supposed to be up in the blood bank.<eos> - You having a blood transfusion?<eos> - I don't like needles.<eos> Yeah, well, none of us do but sometimes we gotta use them to make you feel better.
Now he's nothing but a shell.<eos> Consumed with hatred ungoverned by any other feeling.<eos> You.<eos> I wish you taken an overdose ever more.<eos> You should be begging for forgiveness.<eos> I feel confusion.<eos> Fear of punishment,... and sadness at your anger and contempt, and regret.<eos> What a waste!<eos> What a failure!<eos> Taelons can no more be sane with selected emotions than human can without them.
I was watching.<eos> A couple of questions: You know that last move... where that woman tripped you and pinned you to the floor?<eos> What would you do next?<eos> She'd take the keys and jam them in your..<eos> What would you do next?<eos> -Who, me, the attacker?<eos> -Yes, that's right.<eos> Why? I tried attacking two women.<eos> No, it's okay. They're my friends.<eos> In fact, I was married to one of them.
Tyrell's got three kids to support.<eos> I go there to remind him!<eos> How did you make a new one with no conjugal visits?<eos> Immaculate conception.<eos> Welcome to Parole Phone.<eos> To pay with sex, press one.<eos> To donate to a phoney charity, press two.<eos> - It's the donations that are phoney.<eos> - Also a great place to find women.<eos> Three of them had stayed at the TWS shelters.
Sir, I was in Homicide in 1995.<eos> But it's still yours.<eos> Have you done anything on these cases lately?<eos> No, sir. They were considered cold.<eos> You realise, if no progress is made soon on these cases we'll be time-barred from prosecuting.<eos> Sir, I am aware of the five-year statute of limitations on rape but...<eos> Have you talked to any of the victims since you took command of the SVU?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - Now's your opportunity.<eos> One of them has volunteered to address us today. Ms Kraft?
Right this way.<eos> Where did you stash our outcry witness, in the boiler room?<eos> He's on his scheduled break in the employee cafeteria.<eos> Guy's gotta eat.<eos> And the show must go on.<eos> Bet the party didn't miss a beat.<eos> So tell us, Winston, exactly how long did you detain the victim... before allowing her to receive medical attention?<eos> We wanted to get that girl to the hospital right off. She refused.<eos> Traumatized victims frequently refuse treatment.<eos> Most people know better than to listen to them.
Where is it, then?<eos> In your left palm.<eos> How did you...? Superior visual acuity.<eos> See you in Sick Bay.<eos> I'm detecting a vessel on long-range scans. The warp signature matches the impostor's ship.<eos> Harry, tell Tom his coffee break is over.<eos> Set a pursuit course.<eos> The photon torpedoes you gave me are worthless.<eos> No better than plasma flares. No better than plasma flares.<eos> Perhaps you didn't arm them properly.
- Ainsley Hayes, is that true?<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> - Is Sam Seaborn lying?<eos> - " Lying " is an awfully strong word.<eos> - Do you...?<eos> - Yes, he's lying.<eos> And we should tell the truth about education.<eos> - If you're gonna call... - The bill had money for textbooks.<eos> Also, computer literacy, school safety, physical plant.<eos> The difference is we wanted to give the money to communities and let them decide how to spend it on the off-chance the needs of Lincoln High in Dayton are different from...
Let me tell you. In 1974, India set off a peaceful nuclear explosion.<eos> Indira Ghandi said they had no intention of building a bomb just wanted to know that they could.<eos> 20 years later, India sets off five nuclear explosions.<eos> Who gets nervous?<eos> Pakistan. When Pakistan gets nervous, everybody gets nervous.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because we're all gonna die.<eos> Sam, half of America's work force is employed by small business.<eos> That's companies that employ fewer than 100 workers.<eos> - I know what it is. - Then you know that a third of them fail.
What is it?<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Xena, you killed it. It's over.<eos> No, that monster that I locked in the mine long ago..., ...I cut off one of its fingers.<eos> What I killed just now, it had all of its fingers.<eos> If then wasn't Grinhilda, then what was it?<eos> That's Grinhilda.<eos> And whatever it was I killed, she's not happy about it.<eos> We gotta get to the Rhine maidens.<eos> I got somethin' that belongs to them.
Why, Marcus, so she is.<eos> This object kills me.<eos> Fainthearted boy, arise and look upon her.<eos> Speak, Lavinia.<eos> What accursed hand hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?<eos> What fool hath added water to the sea or brought a torch to bright-burning Troy?<eos> My grief was at the height before thou camest, and now like Nilus, it disdaineth bounds.<eos> Give me a sword. I'll chop off my hands, too, for they have fought for Rome, and all in vain.<eos> In bootless prayer have they been held up, and they have served me to effectless use.<eos> Now all the service I require of them is that the one will help to cut the other.
- A waiter hears... many things spoken when people are relaxing and eating.<eos> A waiter has many opportunities for betrayal.<eos> He betrayed you?<eos> He betrayed us. Us!<eos> Come. This way.<eos> These are the breeding pools.<eos> Is this... Is this where you caught today's special?<eos> We originally were raising these mutant creatures... for their nervous systems for game-pods.<eos> But then we found they could be quite tasty. So we opened the restaurant, and now that is our cover.<eos> We are also raising them as components... for undetectable and hypoallergenic weapons.
- Why don't you show him around?<eos> Your name is Rose Rose?<eos> - Pretty, ain't it?<eos> - Very.<eos> - You like to read?<eos> - I really can't read that good.<eos> Homer, what does this say?<eos> Here.<eos> "I looked at the stars and considered...<eos> "how awful it would be for a man to turn his face to them...
Put it in your mouth, light it up and you're going to get your fix.<eos> You're gonna get your fix.<eos> - Shall I send for coffee?<eos> Sorry I'm late. - WALLACE:<eos> No, we're fine.<eos> - Are you sure? - BERGMAN:<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right. I thought we'd get together because there's a legal concept that has been getting some new attention recently.<eos> Tortious interference.<eos> If two people have an agreement, like a confidentiality agreement, and one of them breaks it because they are induced to do so by a third party, the third party can be sued for damages for interfering.
Get on with it.<eos> These are for you.<eos> What is this?<eos> What is this supposed to be?<eos> You said that your knowledge of The Nine Gates was extensive but did you ever compare your copy with the other two?<eos> No.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Well, you should.<eos> These are copies of the engravings in Balkan's book.<eos> You'll find that some of them differ from yours.
And some people will be affected by it sooner than others.<eos> But probably five years is the best guess for now.<eos> And at the end of five years?<eos> Every man, woman and child of Earth will be dead.<eos> Unless they can find a cure.<eos> If the plague was created by Shadow technology centuries ahead of our own how do they plan to solve it in five years?<eos> They can't.<eos> But since this came to us from outside then maybe we can find a cure out there.<eos> I mean, we know there are other races as old as the Shadows.<eos> One of them must have found a cure.
She wrote his name on all her underwear.<eos> Mum found them and bleached out all the Kevins.<eos> Lux is crying on her bed all day.<eos> "The trees, like lungs filling with air<eos> "My sister, the mean one, pulling my hair"<eos> And so we started to learn about their lives. Coming to hold the memories of times we hadn't experienced.<eos> We felt the imprisonment of being a girl. How it made your mind active and dreamy. And how you learnt what colors went together.<eos> We knew that the girls were really women in disguise. They understood love and even death.<eos> Our job was to create the noise that fascinated them.<eos> They knew everything about us, but we couldn't fathom them at all.
- l wasn't able to express the anger I felt. - .. Lydia Perl, Channel Eight News.<eos> None of my daughters lacked for any love.<eos> There was plenty of love in our house.<eos> I never understood why. After the suicides, Mr and Mrs Lisbon gave up any attempt to lead a normal life.<eos> They had Mr Hadley pack up the house, and sell the furniture in a garage sale.<eos> Mr Lisbon sold the house to a young couple from Boston.<eos> We, of course, took the family photos that were put out with the trash.<eos> In the end, we had pieces of the puzzle, but gaps still remained.<eos> Oddly-shaped emptiness, mapped by what surrounded them, like countries we couldn't name.<eos> What lingered after them was not life, but the most trivial list of mundane facts -
In fact, Sam's father built it, didn't he?<eos> We're so proud of Alice. We couldn't be prouder.<eos> I've had it.<eos> Goodbye cruel world.<eos> You don't understand me.<eos> I'm a teenager, I got problems.<eos> So much has been said about the girls over the years, but we have never found an answer.<eos> It didn't matter how old they had been, or that they were girls,<eos> but only that we had loved them. And that they still do not hear us calling them out of those rooms where they went to be alone for all time.<eos> We will never find the pieces to put them back together.
She left me.<eos> She took the kids, went across to Tijuana to her sister's.<eos> You gotta help me out of this.<eos> You don't tell me shit.<eos> I gotta have somebody backing me up!<eos> Just for them to see I got somebody behind me, I got family!<eos> I mean, who else can I trust?<eos> But the women....<eos> We go by Tenakee Springs tomorrow.<eos> We drop them off there.

Beth.<eos> Elsie.<eos> Sharon.<eos> Gaye.<eos> Bobbi.<eos> Jakki.<eos> Samantha.<eos> All on their own journeys.<eos> Lost girls.<eos> I was the world to them.
-You took some aspirin.<eos> -l took a bottle of aspirin.<eos> That buys you a year in this place?<eos> That"s bullshit, okay?<eos> They"re breaking you.<eos> Everything"s changing, man.<eos> What do they know about being normal?<eos> I have friends in here.<eos> Who?<eos> Them?
- There isn't any mister.<eos> Uh, Dominick, Dominick Barbieri?<eos> That was my father.<eos> He passed away years ago.<eos> Wow. Maybe you oughta have a yard sale.<eos> That case always bothered my father.<eos> He never talked about it.<eos> He said he had to live in this town, you know? Yeah.<eos> Do you have any idea where his notes might be?<eos> Well, if he kept them at all, they'd be in one ofthose boxes.
Compassion... what is compassion?<eos> Compassion?<eos> What, you're kidding, right?<eos> ...it's a feeling, that you have when you see someone else's pain, and instead of taking advantage of their weakness, you help them.<eos> - Oh, I know this feeling.<eos> - Well, it is a fairly common human feeling.<eos> Mmm... I hate it!<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm on the wrong team here! I'm just going to stay!<eos> Fine... do what you want, but if you stay with these lowlifes, you'll die with them.
No! That's not worth painting!<eos> Paint this.<eos> unfortunately our advice couldn't prevent his vile marriage!<eos> Have you noticed Mrs. Verdurin's magnificent pearl necklace?<eos> admirable, I agree.<eos> black pearls. They used to be white.<eos> Is that so?<eos> My story of our hostess's pearls<eos> leaves Mr. Goncourt skeptical. He's wrong.<eos> A fire blackened them.
No.<eos> It is a matter which the Central Security Office, or more precisely IV/B4, was unable to decide in any case.<eos> But the number 700, as far as I remember, was then a normal number relative to the number of wagons which is not mentioned here, otherwise it would be easy to calculate.<eos> It was the usual number for transports of military personnel.<eos> In a military transport, each soldier had his baggage with him.<eos> But in this particular case, the luggage was locked in special goods wagons that were made available and attached to the train.<eos> Silence!<eos> You may think what you like but keep it to yourselves.<eos> - So that...<eos> So that the people who were being transported didn't have their luggage with them, because it was in the additional goods wagons.
We can still have fun.<eos> We can still have fun, but I don't want to go fast.<eos> You maybe need a better skater when you try your tricks.<eos> Oh, no, my skate's undone.<eos> My lace is undone, we have to go to the wall.<eos> We don't want you tripping and falling.<eos> No, don't go too fast.<eos> I'm way behind you here.<eos> Hey, these girls are really good.<eos> Maybe one of them will skate with you.
- l said:<eos> what a void!<eos> Such immensity!<eos> - Lovely night!<eos> - Yes.<eos> When I was a kid, my mom's uncle told me how the stars get up in the sky at night.<eos> He said:<eos> every night, someone, we don't know who, gathers all the stars in his hand, and shakes them like dice... then throws them out into space.<eos> That's why every night, the stars aren't exactly where they were before, and sometimes, they fall to Earth... into the eyes of little girls like you.<eos> And make them sparkle!
- She's done it all.<eos> What color selection !<eos> What flower arrangement!<eos> Ladies love flattery but only from the heart.<eos> Isn't it, Sadhna?<eos> - That's the problem with ladies!<eos> Either way you're in hot soup.<eos> Raju, Bablu, I'll give you a tip.<eos> You can never win with ladies.<eos> Then why do you fight them?
Let's go to the umbrella.<eos> See how lucky he was!<eos> I swear!<eos> Had it been me...<eos> And this is the palace of the queens.<eos> They say, the youngest queen was the most beautiful one!<eos> She'd sing in her melodious voice among her friends.<eos> And dance too.<eos> Hearing the sound of their music and their anklets...<eos> Hundreds of peacocks would dance here with them.
-excellent, that's exactly what I had in mind.<eos> -It's not time yet, we're still on playback.<eos> No need for inhibitions, if you feel like crying, that's great, too.<eos> Don't get nervous, everything will be fine.<eos> And I'd say, Iet's let the Strohmayers answer the questions, they're easier to understand and it makes a better impression.<eos> -Those were the ladies from the belly dancing club... -Jeannie. -...from Linz, and you're all...<eos> -Housewives.<eos> Thank you for your performance.<eos> These special guests have shown us ... how dancing and exercise can ... keep you fit and happy.<eos> For them this is no Ionger just a hobby, it has become a passion.
Do you have any medical evidence to Support your claim?<eos> No.<eos> It's just a gut feeling.<eos> But shouldn't something like this have some evidence...<eos> Miss journalist, do you have some evidence?<eos> It could be the new virus from the recent meteor shower...<eos> No one knew what aids was when it was first discovered.<eos> Have you thought of this?<eos> For instance, the theory that the same virus killed all four simultaneously is more plausible than a supernatural force as a cause of death.<eos> these critters already know that I'm getting them out to play with them or to kill them.
Then came the vote.<eos> 87%/ approved the plan.<eos> It was the end of seven months of occupation of Boel shipyard.<eos> After the voting, each of the union secretaries holds a farewell speech, not without sincere emotion.<eos> I asked someone :<eos> "Have you started looking for a job ?<eos> He answered : "Not yet.<eos> I'm waiting until the last day.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> And when the gates close, I'll be there, listening to them squeaking.
But that's how gay women do it -- they send mixed signals.<eos> I mean, say what you want about men, but at least they're obvious.<eos> Ally, if it goes there, all you have to say is "Not for me."<eos> What's with all the panic?<eos> As a general rule ...<eos> Where's Whipper?<eos> She is on vacation between jobs.<eos> As a general rule, the idea of kissing another woman grosses me out - ick.<eos> But sometimes, the idea of kissing certain women doesn't gross me out.<eos> I-it's not like I'm attracted to them, but I ... well, the idea of kissing them isn't, I don't know, repulsive.
You know what I mean.<eos> Maybe you should go see a doctor.<eos> I don't need to go to the doctor, Mom.<eos> She's talking to Mom.<eos> I can't explain it either, Mom.<eos> It just happened.<eos> I felt a twinge in my stomach and then, bam, I saw it.<eos> - Saw what?<eos> - Three women, warlocks.<eos> And one of them was taking Prue.
I don't know, maybe only one set of us can have powers at the same time, in the same time.<eos> Thank you, Mr Spock.<eos> I was working, that's why I couldn't take your call.<eos> The premonition you had, did you see what the warlocks look like?<eos> The warlocks? No, I didn't see their faces.<eos> Why?<eos> I'll tell you why:<eos> Because I saw them.<eos> All three of them, here.<eos> And one of them had a hold of Prudence.
- I'm going, I'm going.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Prue?<eos> - What?<eos> Okay.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> Hello. There are other people in this house that have styling needs too.<eos> - Is there a Prue in there also?<eos> - One of them, yes.
She works here in the cafeteria.<eos> Well, that must be nice for both of you.<eos> Watch my finger.<eos> To come to the same place for work.<eos> We need to pull the gown down now.<eos> All right?<eos> The burns seem to be well-healed.<eos> Yes.<eos> They're not a problem.<eos> Had them for a while?
On their days off, patients dwell on their problems.<eos> Is it the lieutenant who keeps seeing his dead buddy?<eos> I can't go there with you, what if you knew him?<eos> - I don't know him.<eos> - Why are you so interested?<eos> Curious.<eos> I have obsessions of my own, and, you know, I thought I might learn something.<eos> What obsessions have you been having?<eos> Well, there's a certain Navy psychiatrist I think a lot about.<eos> Well, sometimes the best way to get rid of these obsessions is to indulge in them.
My way or your way.<eos> - I don't like needles.<eos> - Sir, please cooperate.<eos> No, no. No!<eos> Thank you for stopping by.<eos> My son wore glasses.<eos> Have you seen them?<eos> We haven't.<eos> We do have officers searching the area.<eos> He can't see without them.
Oh, Frank, don't.<eos> And then I look at Jordan. I look at our daughter's face. And day after day she looks more and more like you.<eos> I can't let go.<eos> You have to protect her.<eos> I didn't protect you.<eos> There was nothing you could have done.<eos> They wanted me to join the Group, and then you'd be saved.<eos> Peter Watts's family is alive.<eos> His daughters have a mother.<eos> They set the table, and she sits down to eat with them.
- I do.<eos> Uh, the ring, please?<eos> If anyone has any objections to the union of these two people... speak now, or forever hold your peace.<eos> By the powers vested in me by the great state of Delaware... I hereby pronounce you husband and wife.<eos> You may kiss the bride.<eos> Congratulations, Mrs. Parker.<eos> I wish you and your husband the very best.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Raines.<eos> I intend to do everything in my power... to make his golden years memorable.<eos> I know I'll remember them. - Ah.
Very bad.<eos> Bad patients.<eos> I have to tell you.<eos> I'm not really into therapy, I think it's kind of bullshit.<eos> - I'm telling Dr. G on you. - No, no!<eos> - Cross your heart.<eos> - Hope to die.<eos> So why are you in therapy, seriously?<eos> I'm really fucked up about women.<eos> After I sleep with them, I completely lose interest.
- Good morning. - Beautiful shoes.<eos> - Just got those in.<eos> - Would you like to try them on?<eos> - No. I'm just looking.<eos> I have way too many shoes as it is.<eos> Size seven?<eos> Size seven.<eos> You are bad.<eos> I'm just trying them on.<eos> I can't even afford them.
-Fuck them! Charlotte said, "Fuck."<eos> Every couple of years, an article like this surfaces as a cautionary tale to scare young women into marriage. I'm a cautionary tale? Shoot me.<eos> "Filling their lives with an endless parade of decoys and distractions...<eos> "...to avoid the painful fact that they're completely alone."<eos> How is that helping?<eos> This piece of trash has nothing, I repeat, nothing to do with us.<eos> -Exactly, we are single and fabulous.<eos> -Absolutely.<eos> But I had a sneaking suspicion they didn't quite believe it.<eos> Somehow, the question mark had leapt off my cover and on to each of them.
There's plenty of nice gents that want a date with you.<eos> Look. I'm going downstairs.<eos> I'm going downstairs before that che bruta Activities lady finds me.<eos> You want coffee?<eos> - Yeah, all right.<eos> - Bring the cookies!<eos> Carmela, I don't want to sound like religion is a cure-all but if Tony got more involved with the Church it may help to expedite things in his therapy.<eos> What's killing me is that this is a self-inflicted wound.<eos> I pushed for it.<eos> I could deal with the goomars. I knew I was better than them.
Everything!<eos> The prayers, the ritual, these robes.<eos> I can't keep pretending I follow the path of the Prophets.<eos> You won't have to.<eos> The "Pah-wraiths" are waiting to embrace you.<eos> So you keep saying, but when will that happen?<eos> When we release them from the fire caves.<eos> - Release them?<eos> But the prophecies...<eos> - What about them?
Washington, DC.<eos> We're almost there, sir. We must find a power source right away.<eos> We will.<eos> Listen, I really have to say this.<eos> The two of you have been unbelievably...<eos> Groovy.<eos> Groovy, I think, is the word.<eos> The people of our world will be extremely grateful.<eos> - Not the Establishment, mind you.<eos> - No, not them.
What has led you to that assumption?<eos> Well, there's... some kind of bad sound on that planet.<eos> It's what made us sick.<eos> It just took you longer to cave in.<eos> I believe the organism was attacking me.<eos> What organism?<eos> I made a discovery while observing your plants.<eos> - You saw them grow?<eos> - Indeed.<eos> I saw several of them rise.
Hi. I'm Grace Adler. 9A.<eos> I'd like to talk about fireplaces.<eos> Now as I understand it. some of them work and some of them don't.<eos> I'd like to find a way to get them all working.<eos> - I thought none of them worked.<eos> - Ah!<eos> No.<eos> Some of them do indeed work.<eos> The rest are sealed shut.<eos> Do any of them work?
-To Capt. Edwards.<eos> -Capt. Edwards.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I had heard there was a party of brave men here.<eos> I'm here to tell you... that I'm not unfamiliar with the ways of men who've been long in the wilderness. I understand their cravings for food and drink... and also their cravings for the companionship of young women.<eos> -Women.<eos> He's got women!<eos> -Where are they?<eos> Wait for me outside.<eos> I will take you to them.
Oh, boy, was I good.<eos> I would write these foolproof plays in my little green notebook that I had.<eos> The opposition didn't even know what hit 'em.<eos> And when Coach Cavanaugh was going to retire, me and Red, we knew that one of us was gonna be his successor.<eos> - Come by to wish me luck?<eos> - Well, not exactly, no, no.<eos> Actually, I come by to get you to do ol' Red a little favor.<eos> - Well, you know that green notebook you use to write all them football plays in?<eos> Well, I need to show Cavanaugh that I can come up with some good play ideas.<eos> But you didn't come up with them.
If I can't see her again, my life is not worth living.<eos> Please.<eos> Switch jobs with me just, you know, for a day.<eos> Th-think of everything I've done for you.<eos> I can't think of anything.<eos> So, think of all the things that I'm gonna do for you.<eos> Would I meet some worker girls?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> They always go for the new guy.<eos> It's like a sport for them.
Beat it!<eos> - Rudy.<eos> - Same? Give me the same, please.<eos> What's up?<eos> - There he is.<eos> - You all right?<eos> You know something?<eos> You've always been right. What have I been so right about?<eos> Women.<eos> You just have fun with them.
- No, I said, "Oh."<eos> "Oh" like, "That's interesting" or like, "We're screwed"?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, hey, whoa, oh.<eos> Forget the "Oh".<eos> I'll go to legal to start on the countersuit.<eos> The chips!<eos> That's the "Oh."<eos> These microprocessing chips.<eos> What do they do and where did you get them from?
That's bad.<eos> - All that for a willy.<eos> - But his is priceless.<eos> I don't like dykes.<eos> That's rather vulgar, darling.<eos> - You're marrying for money.<eos> - No. I'm not a whore.<eos> It's shameful, sluts selling their pussies.<eos> - We have a well of love.<eos> - Don't insult them.
It is said that he and his foreign allies are raising an army that will outnumber your own.<eos> If Your Majesty does not act soon, then he will.<eos> Find the priest and those who harbor him.<eos> All right! Search every room!<eos> You, upstairs!<eos> Where is Lord Arundel?<eos> He's not here, sir.<eos> Do you know where your father is?<eos> You were carrying letters from the Pope.<eos> To whom were you told to give them?
I gotta go to college.<eos> Mike, I'm gonna miss you, man.<eos> It's gonna suck around here without you.<eos> What's you major gonna be, dude?<eos> Botany.<eos> What's that?<eos> Plants.<eos> You're gonna study plants?<eos> I wanna save the rain forests.<eos> Somebody's gotta fight for them.
Imagine begin one of these people living in a tiny village more than 4,000 years ago.<eos> Life would be pretty much the same day in and day out:<eos> Farming, herding cattle, fishing in the Nile.<eos> Then one day, you're selected to hourney be boat down the Nile.<eos> You are now part of the great national project to build the Pharaoh's tomb<eos> but you have no idea what kind of a tomb.<eos> And then you see... a monument to the sun- to life eternal.<eos> How did they move such heavy stones to such great heights?<eos> There are many theories but they probably pulled the blocks up mud-slickened ramps.<eos> Raising the ramps as the pyramid grew measons then set the stones with such precision a postcard couldn't fit beyween them.
I can't leave my family to starve.<eos> I have to buy bread and ice.<eos> I bought some ice.<eos> I have hot bread in one hand and ice in the other.<eos> What else could I do?<eos> Leave the children in the yard.<eos> Ask the neighbor to keep an eye on them.<eos> We talked about this. You promised.<eos> Your girls are back home.<eos> You should treat them better than this.
Leave the children in the yard.<eos> Ask the neighbor to keep an eye on them.<eos> We talked about this. You promised.<eos> Your girls are back home.<eos> You should treat them better than this.<eos> If I don't lock the door, boys climb over the wall.<eos> Their ball falls in our yard, they want it back, so, they climb over the wall.<eos> I can't let the girls play in the yard.<eos> If anyone touched them, I'd be dishonored.<eos> You could lock the front gate and ask the neighbor to keep an eye on them.
That's right, now you've got it.<eos> And next...<eos> Oh, all right, let's try it.<eos> OK, OK!<eos> Excellent!<eos> You've got it now!<eos> These videotapes contain a record of your life.<eos> One for each year, seventy-one in all.<eos> They won't match your memories exactly, so please just use them for reference.<eos> Watch them as a way of bringing back the past.
Saturday evening,... ..and the universe is much the same as at any other point in the history of the world.<eos> The planets and stars orbit and spin, and do everything that is expected of them.
Come to me, Kali.<eos> I conjure thee, Kali.<eos> I'm here, Aviva.<eos> - It's been over a week.<eos> - I know. Be patient, Aviva.<eos> But I've done everything that you've asked.<eos> I've followed the Halliwell sisters. I know their every move.<eos> Which will all become valuable in good time.<eos> You must trust me.<eos> You must make them want you as badly as you want them.
Redrum!<eos> Redrum!<eos> This will cost your mother a fortune!<eos> Well, what else should she spend her money on?<eos> Something boring, like college funds for her other granddaughters?<eos> I just keep telling myself that Erin hasn't had the advantages our girls have.<eos> Advantages?<eos> You got me.<eos> You know, if the girls see us, we're going to die.<eos> They said we'd make them feel self-conscious.
- Listen, Dawson, that little secret you had yesterday... Tamara?<eos> You really should've told me.<eos> - I tried to tell you.<eos> You were off and down the hall before I could get it out.<eos> - Well, you see, we got a situation here, now, because I realized last night that I'm not entirely over her.<eos> - Oh, boy.<eos> Um, Pacey, I'm your friend and I want to be supportive, and helpful, but the only thing I can think of to say to you in good conscience is stay away.<eos> You haven't even fully recovered from the gossip fallout of your last completely illegal interlude.<eos> There are girls your age, there are girls who like you.<eos> Would it be so terrible if you fell for one of them?
That is untrue.<eos> I only decided that today.<eos> Did I hear you right, commander?<eos> I am convinced Major Mackenzie killed her husband.<eos> Farrow is innocent and I will defend him to the limits of my abilities.<eos> And if that means incriminating the major, so be it.<eos> You are a self-serving, arrogant bastard, Brumby.<eos> One day, you and I will have a private conversation about that.<eos> Oh, that we will, Brumby. That we will.<eos> Maybe your tactics work in the Australian Navy, but I don't think much of them here.
This could get tiring.<eos> You have nothing to fear, niños.<eos> If I flip this switch, all you will see is a bright light.<eos> No pain.<eos> Just a bright light.<eos> And then you'll sleep.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I'm an Engineering officer.<eos> I was going aft to check on the turbines.<eos> One of them is running hot.
Ma'am, we have reason to believe your husband's death may be linked with Admiral Whelan's homicide.<eos> Six years ago,<eos> Bill was on an inspection tour of the Kitty Hawk.<eos> A tie-down chain on the flight deck snapped and a link hit him in the head.<eos> The doctor said he was fine.<eos> Two weeks later he had his first seizure.<eos> Temporal-lobe epilepsy.<eos> You have done your homework, commander.<eos> The seizures were mild.<eos> You couldn't even tell he was having them unless you knew.
Now, when we get there, I don't want you busting in like some bucking bronco, young man.<eos> I want you to be real nice to these ladies and get to know them.
Look... I know all about you and Sarah Lawton.<eos> I'm sure she'd like to help, wouldn't she?<eos> Good news. The best.<eos> Simone has turned up, alive and well. Just a few bruises.<eos> When can I see her?<eos> Now. She's at the station. Hop in the car.<eos> Yes!<eos> I was waiting for the Causton bus when a black Saab drew up.<eos> To be honest, I thought it was my ex-boyfriend, but then two people got out, stocking masks,<eos> one of them punched me in the face and bundled me in the back.
Yeah, you don't even know how to damn them.<eos> I just told you.<eos> You simply let them go through the routine of living their lives as they see fit.<eos> Until they realize their lives are unfit to live.<eos> It never ceases to amuse me how these idiots only learn to appreciate the freedom of life just when they're taking it, and just before they hit pay dirt.<eos> Well, if you ask me, subtlety is for closet homosexuals.<eos> What's that crack supposed to mean?<eos> I just find your laissez-faire style as lame as the souls you're destroying.<eos> Why be a devil if you can't have a little fun?<eos> I'm familiar with your methods, and I find them crass and unpoetic.
All right, listen. Is it located by a river, a lake, the ocean, something like that?<eos> - A river, yeah.<eos> - He rented a boat.<eos> He does his business. He runs out to the pier.<eos> - He escapes in a boat.<eos> - Unless-<eos> Unless I make sure he doesn't.<eos> Plates came in. They're being delivered this afternoon.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Have them sent here.
I'm going to enjoy watching this.<eos> He's going to beat you.<eos> He's going to escape and go back to DS9 and his friends and we're all going to have a good, long laugh at your expense.<eos> Enough!<eos> I've locked onto them.<eos> Transporter room to bridge.<eos> We have the survivors on board.<eos> Two women.<eos> An ensign and a lieutenant.<eos> Dr Bashir is checking them now.
I'm glad you agree.<eos> It's not wise to travel this region without adequate defenses.<eos> I've seen scuttled ships with more firepower than Voyager. I'm sure you have.<eos> Imagine what you'll be capable of once the isokinetic cannon is integrated into your defensive systems.<eos> One projectile can penetrate the shields of any heavily- armored vessel.<eos> Hostile species will know to avoid Voyager by reputation alone.<eos> You've made your point, Mr. Kovin.<eos> I want the cannon.<eos> And I'm prepared to give you... astrometric charts spanning 12 sectors.<eos> You'll find them unusually precise.
- I'm Mulder's partner.<eos> What can you tell me?<eos> - Not much. TV news got the call.<eos> That man's voice told them to broadcast a "stunning revelation".<eos> Since then we keep ringing, but nobody answers.<eos> - Who's inside?<eos> - We can't be sure of the total.<eos> It happened over lunch hour, so it could've been worse.<eos> The lot's got 18 cars.<eos> One of them's registered to Agent Mulder.
Mrs. Morgendorffer, I'm afraid I have some rather bad news.<eos> Your daughter, Daria, appears to have been involved in an act of vandalism.<eos> Mrs. Morgendorffer, your daughter collaborated with Jane Lane in the creation of a poster for our art contest.<eos> Yes, I'm aware of that.<eos> We found part of the poster unacceptable, so it was altered prior to its entry.<eos> Unfortunately, someone defaced the poster while it was on display, and since your daughter and Ms. Lane had objected to changing it,<eos> I must assume that they were the vandals. I'm afraid I'm going to have to take drastic action.<eos> Wait a moment.<eos> You're saying the girls were against changing the poster, but entered it into the contest anyway?<eos> It was entered for them.
I was hoping, for the future, that you would understand.<eos> The two girls.<eos> You talked to them before they died.<eos> They were your daughters.<eos> What did you tell them?<eos> - The truth.<eos> - What truth?<eos> That the thousand days had begun.<eos> And that I'm dying.<eos> I won't make it with them to the other side.
Children are often very oblique in their responses.<eos> We wouldn't want any misinterpretations.<eos> Would we?<eos> You were such a good girl at the dentist, I'm going to take you to the park.<eos> Jordan, what would you think if I straightened my hair?<eos> Maybe it's time for a change.<eos> - Sweetheart, put on your high tops.<eos> - I don't wanna wear them anymore.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Daddy and I had a fight over them.
- What are you looking for?<eos> - l'm not sure.<eos> Frank, please.<eos> Let me in, OK? I'm an academic.<eos> I'm not a cop. I don't know the rules.<eos> There are no rule books.<eos> Every situation is different.<eos> - Anything different about these bags?<eos> - Like what?<eos> Did you label them all with your name and address?
A month's suspended sentence it doesn't mean anything.<eos> You already got a record.<eos> I don't want to go to any sex clinic.<eos> If that's part of the deal...<eos> Mr. Holsten, listen to me for a second.<eos> Look at me.<eos> So far, you ain't made it in life.<eos> Seven years a lawyer and I'm still representing guys who walk around dropping their pants.<eos> That tells me I got moving up to do too.<eos> I like to look for victories where I can find them.
We've waited many years for you.<eos> Then you know why I've come. Yes.<eos> We understand.<eos> Like you. a single act has cursed us.<eos> My ancestors were known for their beautiful hair. They'd never cut it. And it would grow the length of their bodies.<eos> From sunrise to sunset. the eldest daughter would comb her hair.<eos> It's said she preferred to tend to her locks... than to the needs ofher husband and child.<eos> One day her infant daughter drowned in the lake.<eos> So obsessed had she been with her vanity. that she hadn't heard the child's cries.<eos> From that day on. all the women of the clan... and every daughter born to them... would forever be haunted by visions of death.
Sorry, we're out of food.<eos> We ran out of funding.<eos> We couldn't get enough sponsors, so we gotta pack it up.<eos> I'm not an Ethernopian.<eos> I gotta get home!<eos> Sorry, we just don't have any funds.<eos> Here, have a Teiko sports watch.<eos> Weak!<eos> People, we all have to do our part against the evil turkeys.<eos> - There's too many of them.
What do you mean?<eos> When you asked me to guide you on a vision quest I agreed, but I also told you it was part of an ongoing process. We're supposed to be discussing your progress.<eos> What's left to say?<eos> I've told you-- I saw my sister, the Great Forest.<eos> I feel a sense of peace I've never felt in my entire life.<eos> It worked.<eos> You've only lived with the visions for a couple of days.<eos> That's not enough time to draw any conclusions.<eos> You've got to reflect on the images, examine them.<eos> Allow them to stay alive in your mind.
I am conducting my own investigation of the crime.<eos> I see.<eos> For a moment, I thought you had another reason for asking.<eos> You...struggle with violent thoughts as well.<eos> Terrible images, but they're hidden deep within your mind.<eos> I am in control of those images.<eos> All members of the Vulcan race learn to inhibit emotions.<eos> If my unconscious thoughts are disturbing you, I will attempt to suppress them further.<eos> No, please. Don't trouble yourself.<eos> I can't see them clearly enough to be affected.
Three that I know of besides me-- what was left of my crew-- along with some Klingons, Cardassians, Romulans, and dozens of other species I'd never seen before.<eos> And the ones that put you in stasis? I don't know.<eos> They must have had some kind of colony here at some time because of the ruined buildings and equipment they left scattered around.<eos> We've never seen them again.<eos> Everyone here has pretty much the same story.<eos> They were just grabbed from wherever they happened to be and dumped.<eos> Why did those people kill Kaplan?<eos> We were no threat to them.<eos> There are dozens of different races on this planet, all of whom were brought here against their will.<eos> Many of them are suspicious of other species.
Here sir.<eos> What have we got?<eos> I thought I saw something just as we came through, sir.<eos> Teal'c? Did we score already?<eos> I saw movement as well.<eos> This way.<eos> I hope these things are as big as you say they are.<eos> There is enough tranquilizer in these darts to knock out a Rino.<eos> They are very large, but extremely maneuverable in the air.<eos> We will find them most vulnerable when they hover.

Is that not news to you?<eos> Do you have any insight into how five women came to be inseminated with your sperm?<eos> - You make it sound so romantic.<eos> - You're saying there was romance involved?<eos> Why is that so hard to believe?<eos> Just cos I was born with a tail, no woman would want me?<eos> Maybe I got personality.<eos> You ever think of that?<eos> You had sex with these women?<eos> How is it that none of them have any recollection whatsoever of that happening?
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you.<eos> Yeah, I'll take care of him.<eos> And Mr. Eddy called.<eos> Can I call him and tell him to come in?<eos> - Yeah. Call him. Tell him I'm back.<eos> And, uh, you know, I'm ready to work. - You're ready to work? Yeah.<eos> Well, let's go to work.<eos> Petey's back.<eos> There's 9 People down here.<eos> And you're gonna ask 7 of them.
But can the gummy worms really live in peace With the marshmallow chicks?<eos> No, pinky.<eos> I will create my own conspiracy theory.<eos> I shall fabricate a wild and improbable story In order to convince the public That i am the victim of a hidden plot<eos> Narf! Mr. Lollipop is happy now.<eos> Pinky, put mr. Lollipop down And get me a glue stick.<eos> Oh, we always have to play with your friends.<eos> Mr. Glue stick.<eos> Our subject tonight is conspiracies--<eos> Who's behind them and who profits from them?
-Yes.<eos> -Has he mended them well?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I want to see how the shoes look.<eos> -I haven't got them.<eos> -You are kidding.<eos> I swear it is true.<eos> I had been to Akbar Aqa's shop to get potatoes.<eos> When I got back your shoes were gone.<eos> I searched everywhere but I couldn't find them
It's her.<eos> My baby.<eos> I'm sorry, Mrs. Lefferts.<eos> Who's in charge of this investigation?<eos> Captain Smith and myself.<eos> Why?<eos> "The Nite Owl Massacre. "<eos> Hyperbole aside... ... thisisaheinouscrime that requires swift resolution.<eos> Six victims.<eos> One of them, one of our own. Dick Stensland.
Whatever you're saying, the answer is no!<eos> Besides, we aren't invited.<eos> Great! At least somebody dressed up!<eos> It's a costume party, remember?<eos> There! That makes two of us.<eos> We know how you feel, but it's a cure.<eos> We're letting him enact his fantasy to banalise it.<eos> If it's not taboo, it's less exciting.<eos> Like girls in chocolate factories?<eos> At first, they let them... eat themselves sick, and it puts them off for life.
What's this hick doing here?<eos> You should've seen the goings on last night!<eos> Swine! is this gratitude?<eos> I risked jail to show your brother the ropes.<eos> And you threw me overboard? Degenerate clowns!<eos> You can't even raise a tent without me.<eos> I've lost my circus, my money, my vest! In this damn hole!<eos> I hope you fall on concrete and don't die, and have no money for a doctor.<eos> I'll be stinking rich yet. I can start again, even here!<eos> O Lord, bless our seeds and let them grow... Pull!
You look cool.<eos> Your Honor, so pleased to see you.<eos> So excited about being here.<eos> What you got? What you got?<eos> That's right.<eos> We know these hormones are responsible for growth, bone structure, exoskeletal physiology and skin maintenance.<eos> A huge influx of these could easily cause it to change.<eos> Of course it could.<eos> Do you think Whitney knew about the properties of these leaves before he sent them?<eos> Maybe he wasn't just using them as packing material.
You're not working as many bees these days.<eos> - Can you deliver?<eos> - I said 30.<eos> Well, it's gonna be a good year.<eos> At least as long as they can keep the Chinese from dumping their honey.<eos> Chinese don't have anything like our tupelo.<eos> Ulee, most folks don't seem to care anymore.<eos> Cheap honey floods the market.<eos> The bees and I have an understanding.<eos> I take care of them, they take care of me.
Nothing.<eos> It's for my mom.<eos> No, I can't tonight, Markie.<eos> Of course. I miss you too.<eos> I'm really busy right now.<eos> All right.<eos> Talk to you later. Bye.<eos> How is she?<eos> And see, sometimes the bees get confused... and run away.<eos> That's them there on the tree.
Secured inside its watertight housing, the IMAX-camera is loaded and ready to roll.<eos> The 200 pound unit is lifted out of the boat and down into the water.<eos> If Paul and Manny run into any trouble, the housing is buoyant and will float to the surface were it can be retrieved.<eos> They prepare to film the nearby whales, holding the camera just under the surface before diving.<eos> Under water, the whales seem ready for their close-ups.<eos> The divers describe the experience... The first pass by she looked at me very curious.<eos> The second time, she stuck with me like glue.<eos> She was so playful...<eos> Its incredibly!<eos> They really suck you along, they pull you right along with them.
It must also be hard for Niitaka, her fiancé.<eos> The accident happened when he was driving the bus.<eos> Niitaka, the man engaged to her...<eos> It wasn't his fault.<eos> But he couldn't bear the grief.<eos> He quit the company and went away.<eos> I heard a strange thing from my colleagues a while ago.<eos> I wanted to tell Tsuyako, but she died before I could.<eos> A driver of the Blue Bus company in Tokyo, had relationships with many women.<eos> And when he got tired of them he'd kill them one after another.
' l heard I'll be there soon lt's 'Jonco' for sure I'll look after her I know some of her friends I called nearby hotels just in case if something happens again lf there's problem with those guys,<eos> we will get into bad situation as well lf we don't stop it here situation will be worse<eos> Work it out right<eos> That guys one of them is a governor, huh?<eos> Other is just dumbass he's a baseball player l don't know how he was 4th batter and first base<eos> He's too thoughtless<eos> Call girl or not he doesn't care<eos> These days high school girls are crazy<eos> Even their looks are messed up<eos> None of them tries to fulfill something
I did this for myself, honey.<eos> You did it because Playboy tells you...<eos> Don't tell me why I did what I did, all right?<eos> Phil, I think it's important to realize that... many intelligent women find the operation empowering.<eos> Hold on!<eos> I think these women are jealous.<eos> They know that girl...<eos> What's her name?<eos> - Cindy.<eos> - They know Cindy looks better than them.
For an hour, a group of several whales remain close to Fleur.<eos> We identified every individual.<eos> Several males courting a female.<eos> A team prepares to dive.<eos> We all dream to observe underwater, the love ballet of the humpback.<eos> The whales keep their distance.<eos> We can barely distinguish them, in the water loaded with sediment by bad weather in recent days.<eos> Some casual strokes of the tail are enough for the whales to outdistance us.<eos> Hey, that was great, I saw them close up.<eos> Every time I approached them, they dived and then...
So, you can see where this is going.<eos> Tell us anyway.<eos> All of the symbols are on the Stargate in the Abydos chamber.<eos> I've also charted some of them in the Abydos night sky,... ..or at least pretty close.<eos> Jack, I think that this is a map of a... ..a vast network of Stargates, Stargates all over the galaxy.<eos> I don't think that can be, Doctor.<eos> Why not?<eos> After Colonel O'Neill came back, my team tried hundreds of symbol permutations. It never worked.<eos> I tried here and it didn't work.<eos> But I figured the destinations I tried were destroyed or buried. But, um, some of them somewhere must still exist.
LETTER TO LI EUTENANTS The war in Brazil... whichever the terrain, is the war of our movement.<eos> For us, the rebels, the movement is victory.<eos> When the troops marched on a region cleared of enemies... I would organize the vanguard, the whole troop would leave... and only then I would organize the rearguard... so it could protect the column.<eos> I've always walked wide steps, so I'd go through the entire column... talk to each soldier, and I knew each one of them by their names.<eos> Every complaint, every problem... was brought to me.<eos> The column had my name because in every city we hit... if the locals had any complaints or wishes... the soldier would tell them to talk to Colonel Prestes.<eos> So everybody would come to me, and my name was known. That's why the column had my name.<eos> Over 20 women followed our column around.<eos> At the beginning, I was so strict that I didn't want women around.<eos> I adamantly order to the troops... which were organizing the crossing of the river... that no woman could cross over to Santa Catarina... that each one of them should go back home.

I stayed until the end of it.<eos> When I got to Santa Catarina, all the women were there.<eos> They had crossed over.<eos> What could I do? So they continued marching with the column, and they were very helpful.<eos> I had to admit my mistake because... they did not harm the column in any way.<eos> Quite the contrary, they were extremely helpful... helping with the cooking, the care of the wounded. Some of them, during combats... gave information about the enemies movement. Some even carried guns during the combats.
Scary.<eos> Scarier.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Bullets can't kill vampires.<eos> It can hurt them like hell, but...<eos> Did you just hear...?<eos> So many body parts.<eos> So few bullets.<eos> Let's begin with the kneecaps.<eos> No fun dancing without them.
- We're working on him next door.<eos> I'm Jeanie Boulet.<eos> - Mike and Cindy Patterson.<eos> - Have a seat.<eos> - I understand you've got a headache.<eos> - Nothing serious.<eos> Do you have a history of migraines?<eos> - A few in college.<eos> - These are different. - They come on for no reason.<eos> - What caused them before? - Tubas.
I'm half-frozen!<eos> The snow was supposed to stop.<eos> You didn't even get a glimpse.<eos> We'll have to try that again, like in June, July...<eos> Two hot chocolates.<eos> You want something to eat? Yeah, maybe.<eos> I'm afraid I'm not hardy enough for astronomy.<eos> Or crazy enough.<eos> I've never been that interested in the stars themselves.<eos> It's the stories behind them.
Come on, you can get plastic jugs any time.<eos> That's not a jug. That's our innovative Pick-A-Deli.<eos> Its easy lift-up strainer lets you select a pickle without getting your fingers wet.<eos> We've been living like animals.<eos> Come on, don't ruin tonight for me.<eos> I'm only doing this to see my friends... for once, and to have a little fun.<eos> And to find out what's on the cutting edge of food storage systems.<eos> Ray, very classy.<eos> Pay-per-view and dates.<eos> Do I pick them, or do they pick me?
Well, I'm having problems with the story, captain.<eos> You're having problems believing me, and quite frankly, I'm resenting it.<eos> Captain, I can personally attest to the aid and support you give your men.<eos> But if you are helping Lieutenant Judd avoid responsibility, sir...<eos> The short version, commander.<eos> - You're protecting him.<eos> - From unfounded speculation.<eos> It is my job to investigate, captain.<eos> I have seen too many good pilots skewered by rulebook barons and ignorant cos.<eos> If you don't give a man room to make mistakes, you take away his ability to learn from them.
Give me a good reason why I would do that.<eos> Because it's the right thing to do.<eos> Guns are loaded and double-checked, lieutenant.<eos> I'm hoping I won't need them.<eos> If you need them, they'll fire.<eos> - Give them hell.<eos> - Just like always.<eos> It's okay, Max.<eos> Say goodbye to the girls for me.<eos> Tell them I will think of them every day.
You mean your horse friend didn't understand the need for clothes?<eos> Precisely.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Why not be seen as God made us?<eos> Every Christian knows it would be immodest.<eos> Would these ladies and gentlemen be incapable of modesty if they were not wearing clothes?<eos> sir.<eos> 'They were concerned that I was a Yahoo 'and should be treated as one.<eos> 'I told Mistress that if together we could study these creatures 'it would become apparent that I had nothing in common with them. 'and we could clear up this confusion once and for all.
The Congressionals took the lenses?<eos> No, the Congressionals are still looking for Krebs. We know that.<eos> The local cops don't know squat either.<eos> Everybody's chasing their tail.<eos> So who's got the contact lenses now?<eos> Krebs was turned over to a bail bondsman named SchmitZ.<eos> Schmitz was aiming to turn him over to the Congressionals for the bounty.<eos> - Then he got wise to the lenses.<eos> - Worth two million on the black market.<eos> Without them, there's no way I'll get past the retinal scan and on that plane.
What are you talking about?<eos> Hold on, guys. We're coming.<eos> Whatever, Bud.<eos> Our girls have been seduced by breaststrokers.<eos> They bought it!<eos> Swimmers.<eos> Do you have any idea how many diseases are in pools?<eos> Especially after we swim in them. -l know!<eos> -l can't believe this!<eos> Shaved-down pool Nazis oiling up our women... and swimming with them in an Olympic-sized toilet.
- Then call me Shirley.<eos> But let's get this thing moving along.<eos> I don't have any dogs with me and I'm not a very good dancer.<eos> I can only tell you my thoughts.<eos> I lay awake most of last night, wondering how I ended up here.<eos> About how I've spent my life playing people for fools.<eos> And these losers' letters to God gave you a sudden change of heart?<eos> They didn't.<eos> When I first saw them, I thought these people were saps.<eos> If I could have taken advantage of them, I would have.
They would be your friends too-- the others, I mean-- if you'd just let them.<eos> It is in their nature to have fear of me.<eos> - This I cannot change.<eos> - You're very kind to me.<eos> Maybe this is because you are kind to me first.<eos> You were the spider in my window!<eos> You were my first friend.<eos> I mean, since I went to live with my aunts.<eos> - They hated me! - Shh!<eos> Do not think of them now.
Coming out... Coming out...<eos> Stop.<eos> This will make you feel good.<eos> Murderer!<eos> How do you like that?<eos> Take your shoes off. Jun.<eos> - Did you do it again?<eos> Did what?<eos> Two missing students are bound to attract attention.<eos> You're jealous of them.
Coral, you're the air I breathe, my strength, my everything.<eos> I'll never touch a woman.<eos> They're just a job. Sweat.<eos> I'll seduce them with words alone, sweet talk and the odd kiss.<eos> But never sex.<eos> Nothing that would hurt you.<eos> I swear, Coral.<eos> Come in.<eos> - Do you have any bags?<eos> - We left them in the car.
- That dreamers often lie.<eos> In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.<eos> O!<eos> Then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.<eos> She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes in shape no bigger than an agate-stone on the forefinger of an alderman, drawn with a team of little atomies over men's noses as they lie asleep.<eos> Her chariot is an empty hazelnut, her waggoner a small grey-coated gnat. And in this state she gallops night by night through lovers' brains, and then they dream of... love;<eos> o'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees.<eos> Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats;<eos> and, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two, and sleeps again.<eos> This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, that presses them and learns them first to bear, making them women of good carriage!
They're deliberately leaving us alone?<eos> It's possible. They haven't been shy about hitting anybody else.<eos> And if that's true, the obvious question is, why?<eos> Captain?<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> You okay?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Ever since Kosh died, I've been remembering a dream.<eos> Last year, when I was hurt, he got inside my head. He spoke to me, sent images.<eos> One of them was you saying, "Do you know who I am?"
I began to wonder:<eos> What if that future happened because I listened to you and didn't go to Z'ha'dum?<eos> What if...?<eos> What if I could prevent the fall of Centauri Prime and end the Shadow War by going there?<eos> What I want is to stay alive, to be with you.<eos> But you were right before.<eos> This is about more than what I want.<eos> So I'm going, even though I know it's almost certainly a trap.<eos> You see, John, back a million years ago there were forces prowling around the galaxy beyond anything that we could understand.<eos> And, like anything else most of them outgrew this little corner of the universe and headed off toward greener pastures.

No one.<eos> Drake, you are so talented.<eos> Let me see those hands.<eos> Oh, these hands, these beautiful hands.<eos> I could just eat them.<eos> But I won't.<eos> Otherwise my watch would fall off.<eos> No, seriously.<eos> These hands these miracle, magical, life-giving hands.<eos> Just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?
- I have to go.<eos> - Is she okay?<eos> I'm not at liberty to say, sir.<eos> Well, can you tell me how long she'll be in surgery?<eos> I'm sorry, Commander. But I couldn't begin to give you an estimate.<eos> Another 40 to 45 minutes.<eos> Coffee's in the staff lounge.<eos> Was that a guess or do you know?<eos> In the Ice Ages, I clerked for an insurance firm that covered hospitals.<eos> You'd be surprised how many gunshot victims figure they can't collect on whoever shot them, so they sue whoever saved them.
Mosier, Janice Marie.<eos> His mother's ring.<eos> Three years after the fire, he was tried, convicted and sentenced to five years for dui vehicular manslaughter.<eos> Ardis, he was paroled after three.<eos> He didn't stop killing four years ago.<eos> He was just interrupted.<eos> I need two things, Detective.<eos> The church where the wife's funeral was held. The one where the daughter was baptised.<eos> Both will be Protestant.<eos> One of them is where he'll strike next.
Help!<eos> You OK over there?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's just...<eos> My glasses fell off when I tried to shut the door with my arms full and I can't...<eos> Don't worry, I'll find them.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> They should be near the door.<eos> I didn't really feel them fly too far off.
Getting tired of waiting.<eos> I gotta go. Harry...<eos> Damn it!<eos> Don't fight it, use it.<eos> How do I do that? I feel like there's a million fire ants in my brain.<eos> Good.<eos> Make them work for you.<eos> How?<eos> Fire ants sound vicious.<eos> Imagine them as your army moving in a vast wave to conquer your enemy.
Don't destroy any of them, just let them know we're not going to sit here like ducks. Aye, Captain.<eos> What was that?<eos> The interferometric pulses they're emitting?<eos> They've reflected the energy of the phasers right back to us.<eos> Anything we fire is going to affect us instead of them.<eos> What about a photon torpedo?<eos> Since our shield strength is nonexistent, I would not recommend it.<eos> They're only 7,000 kilometers away and still coming.<eos> Harry, start analyzing those interferometric pulses.<eos> See if there's any pattern, any code to them.
The transporter was functioning normally.<eos> Biofilters, pattern buffers, everything checked out.<eos> What about the problem with the molecular imaging scanners?<eos> According to the transporter logs, they were optimal at the time of transport.<eos> It was a perfectly routine beam-out sequence.<eos> No anomalies, no power overloads, no malfunctions.<eos> Our scans of the planet's surface and atmosphere don't show anything out of the ordinary.<eos> There's no evidence of any type of alien interference.<eos> Frankly, Captain, we're at a loss.<eos> And the orchids, Kes? Have you found anything unusual about them?
It was all planned in his head, not on paper.<eos> But Griffiith went even further.<eos> Intolerance was a daring attempt at interweaving stories and characters... not from the same period, but from four different centuries.<eos> Freely crosscutting from one era to another, he blended them altogether in a grand symphony devoted to one idea:<eos> passionate plea for tolerance.<eos> Griffiith"s passion for history was balanced by his passion... for simple people, the victims of history.<eos> In modern day America, a young woman is deemed an unfit mother... because her husband is in jail.<eos> Oppression is represented by society matrons,<eos> Puritan reformers who want to place her baby in an orphanage.<eos> Griffiith"s distressed heroines carried with them... the heart and soul of the picture.

well, that ends right now.<eos> Tomorrow morning, the White House is sending a bill... to Congress for its consideration.<eos> It's White House resolution 455... an energy bill requiring a 20% reduction... of the emission of fossil fuels over the next ten years.<eos> It is, by far, the most aggressive stride ever taken... in the fight to reverse the effects of global warming.<eos> The other piece of legislation is the crime bill.<eos> As of today, it no Ionger exists.<eos> I'm throwing it out.<eos> I'm throwing it out and writing a law that makes sense.<eos> You cannot address crime prevention... without getting rid of assault weapons and handguns.<eos> I consider them a threat to national security... and I will go door to door if I have to... but I'm gonna convince Americans that I'm right, and I'm gonna get the guns.
- Looks like fun!<eos> - For a sheepdog, there's no prouder moment.<eos> Rex and I used to...<eos> Never mind.<eos> Was Rex a champion?<eos> He had the makings of the greatest champion there ever was, but it wasn't to be.<eos> - What happened? - A while back when Rex was in his prime the winter rains brought a great flood to the valley.<eos> Rex and the boss got most of the flock onto the high ground.<eos> Then Rex went back to look for the strays.<eos> He found them.

What's your name?<eos> - Arav Kapoor.<eos> Nice meeting you.<eos> I can see that our association will go a Iong way.<eos> God bless you<eos> congratulations, Arav!<eos> - Thank you!<eos> It's because of you that I was able to taste success today<eos> You were the first one to spot my talent.<eos> Arav, some people make such a name for themselves... that the world remembers them forever
Me, when it's so hot, I get the urge to go to the beach.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait!<eos> Swine!<eos> Uh, Favorita!<eos> Stop!<eos> That pig! "What beautiful hands!" he said, "touch me."<eos> "Make me feel it with your hands.<eos> I'll give you more."<eos> And with a stroke he slipped them off my wrists!
In Vegas, he had the Leaning Tower.<eos> It was a very popular spot. He had politicians, showgirls and movie stars hanging out all over.<eos> That show at The Flamingo gets better and better.<eos> By the way, Sammy said whenever you have a minute, give him a call.<eos> - Made you a messenger, too?<eos> - I'll do anything for a buck.<eos> - He does it to everybody.<eos> Enjoy your dinner. - Thanks.<eos> I got to tell you, the thing Nicky liked most was the showgirls.<eos> To them, Nicky was the movie star.
How you smoke these damn things?<eos> You the only Negro smoke Mexican cigarettes.<eos> Last time I heard these fellas was back in Houston.<eos> The night Mouse pulled me off you.<eos> -That's how you remember it?<eos> -That's the way it was.<eos> Look here admit that you helped Mouse kill Navrochet.<eos> Get off that. You know I didn't have nothing to do with that.<eos> Where the white women?<eos> -I pay them no mind.
You build a chimney so the air feeds the fire underneath.<eos> The rocks are like a windbreak?<eos> Right. Don't build them too high or they'll fall and put out your fire.<eos> - Got enough to eat?<eos> - We got a whole box, Dad.<eos> - If you run out, there's always bugs.<eos> - Bugs?<eos> Yeah, moths and dragonflies bees snails, worms, stuff like that. It's all good.<eos> - That would taste like crap.<eos> - Ants taste like crap because there's too much acid in them, but it's all protein.
Give me your hand.<eos> Why have you lost your trust?<eos> I see a child's bicycle.<eos> Some souls choose to only live for a short time.<eos> Hold these.<eos> Think of two questions.<eos> Tell me only one of them.<eos> Okay.<eos> Why am I having these visions?<eos> You are tied to them by a coincidence of fate.
The Chinese joint?<eos> Yeah.<eos> My cousin lives right up there.<eos> He's mad. Crazy.<eos> His name is Harmonoff.<eos> One time we went to Special Olympics on a school trip.<eos> Seventh grade, whatever.<eos> He tried to pick up these retarded bitches.<eos> That nigga's crazy.<eos> He's still got a thing for them.
What?<eos> I saw them go into the spa.<eos> Alfred, wait a second.<eos> Women can't go in.<eos> Wait here.<eos> May I help you?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - Where are my sisters?<eos> - How would I know? - I'm not their guardian.<eos> - What have you done with them?
- Yes, sir.<eos> Lucy, this is Barnum.<eos> Go ahead, Sheriff. I'm here.<eos> We're still out at the Reeds'.<eos> We got something out here nobody's gonna believe.<eos> - You don't live down here?<eos> I do most of the work around the place... at least until the sun gets too high.<eos> Then the sunglasses don't even help.<eos> Did you know they make contact lenses now... that can protect your eyes from the sun all the time?<eos> I read about them, but Grandpa said they cost too much.
Or did you want to make a silk purse out of my sow's ear again?<eos> What a wanton I'm wed to.<eos> You know what the old wives say about these standing stones?<eos> No.<eos> What do the old wives say, old wife?<eos> Come here.<eos> What do they say?<eos> So, what do they say?<eos> They say the stones make men hard, and women fertile.<eos> We've no need of them, you and me.
- Problem?<eos> - The cops took 'em. - What do you mean?<eos> - They came and took 'em away.<eos> - Why would they do that?<eos> - They said it was standard procedure.<eos> - But those tapes belong to me!<eos> Technically speaking, those tapes actually belong to us.<eos> I mean, to the station, until such time--<eos> I'll show you the section that peaked the cops' interest, you might say.<eos> Today we're talking about sexually transmitted diseases... and teenage attitudes toward them.
- I'm just pushy.<eos> Virgil does like his way, doesn't he?<eos> You're very observant.<eos> As a matter of fact... I can't help but observe right now that there are no chopped onions anywhere.<eos> I think that maybe you'd better just let me finish this alone.<eos> Surely.<eos> And the box in the closet?<eos> Good one, darling.<eos> I used to tell people that when my father called me cruel names, it was just because of his sense of humour.<eos> If you need more towels, you'll find them in the closet down at the end of the hallway.
Tomorrow it'll be gone.<eos> Who taught you to write?<eos> Your grandfather.<eos> He also taught me the names of all the capital cities.<eos> Why have you never attended school?<eos> I didn't speak for a long time.<eos> I was born this small.<eos> There are ants over here.<eos> Don't kill them.<eos> I have them everywhere.
- I have no objection to hearing it.<eos> It is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England.<eos> A single man of large fortune, my dear.<eos> He came down on Monday to see the place.<eos> His name is Bingley and he will be in possession by Michaelmas.<eos> And he has 5,000 a year!<eos> - What a fine thing for our girls!<eos> - How so? How can it affect them?<eos> Mr Bennet, why are you so tiresome?<eos> You know that I'm thinking of his marrying one of them.
Yes, he must indeed!<eos> And who better than one of our five girls?<eos> (LYDIA SNORTS) Lydia!<eos> - What a fine joke if he chose me!<eos> - Or me!<eos> So that is his design in settling here?<eos> To marry one of our daughters?<eos> "Design"?<eos> How can you talk such nonsense?<eos> But he may fall in love with one of them.
How can you talk such nonsense?<eos> But he may fall in love with one of them.<eos> - Therefore you must visit him directly he comes.<eos> - No, no, I see no occasion for that.<eos> - Mr Bennet!<eos> - Go yourself with the girls.<eos> - Still better, send them by themselves.<eos> - By themselves?<eos> !<eos> Aye, for you're as handsome as any of them.
- For he is bent on ruining us all.<eos> - Mamma, he's teasing you.<eos> He will call on Mr Bingley.<eos> He calls on any new neighbour.<eos> Jane, how can you say that?<eos> You heard him!<eos> - You know your father has a will of iron.<eos> - You're in the right, my dear.<eos> I'll tell you what I'll do.<eos> I shall write to Mr Bingley, informing him that I have five daughters, and he is welcome to any of them.
At an assembly such as this?<eos> It would be insupportable.<eos> Your sisters are engaged.<eos> (DARCY):<eos> You know it would punish me to stand up with any other woman.<eos> Good God, Darcy!<eos> I wouldn't be as fastidious as you are for a kingdom!<eos> (BINGLEY):<eos> Upon my honour, I never met so many pleasant girls in my life!<eos> Several of them uncommonly pretty.
Excellent.<eos> (COLLINS):<eos> I must confess myself quite overwhelmed with the charms of your daughters.<eos> Oh, you're very kind, sir.<eos> They are sweet girls, though I say it myself.<eos> Perhaps especially the eldest Miss Bennet?<eos> Ah, yes, Jane is admired wherever she goes.<eos> But I think I should tell you, I think it very likely she will be very soon engaged.<eos> - Ah.<eos> - As for my younger daughters, if any of them...
- You're not unhappy, surely?<eos> - Lord, no!<eos> Just that I can't wait to see my mother's face! And my sisters'.<eos> Kitty will be so envious!<eos> How I shall laugh!<eos> I hope we shall be married from Longbourn. Then all my sisters will have to be my bridesmaids.<eos> Oh, I do wish we could go out into the town, and be seen at plays and assemblies.<eos> All in good time. Be patient, dear.<eos> Lord, it makes me want to burst out laughing when I think that I have done what none of my sisters has.<eos> And I the youngest of them all!
You're having an affair, I chop garlic.<eos> It's a wacky world.<eos> Joe, you ever been in love?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> -Then you haven't.<eos> -You're burning tomatoes.<eos> -You're one to talk.<eos> Your dad's in love.<eos> The worst part is, it's with two different women.<eos> Please tell me one of them is Ma.
Not only do you go ... but you will pay me.<eos> With your meager salary.<eos> So I have no choice.<eos> I guess if I refuse I would end up like Dany Ganon.<eos> An intelligent dog.<eos> I like it.<eos> Dany ... We were caught to talk about a big secret and he could not remain silent.<eos> Some people ... are unable to keep a secret.<eos> It need any report<eos> It's a way for them ... to clear himself.
Yes. I am in flavor country.<eos> - Both of them?<eos> - It's a big country.<eos> Ladies, I apologize.<eos> And you, sir, are worse than Hitler.<eos> Homer, I'm... I'm speechless.<eos> - You just saved our hides.<eos> - On top of everything else don't make me picture your hides.<eos> - It's a wonderful thing you did for my sisters.<eos> - I didn't do it for them.
I'll have someone show you to your quarters.<eos> Thank you, but that won't be necessary.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, those are about the two friendliest vipers I have ever met.<eos> I'll explain later.<eos> Commander, I almost forgot to tell you. Another colleague of ours, Dejar will be arriving later today.<eos> I'll arrange quarters. Thank you.<eos> So... we need to discuss what we're going to do about...<eos> What is it, Major?<eos> There are going to be three of them.
I'm sure you can complete the job on your own.<eos> Chief O'Brien said the modification to the Defiant's phasers would be ready within half an hour.<eos> Half an hour ahead of schedule, hmm?<eos> The Chief's a born engineer.<eos> He always gives himself a comfortable margin with his repair estimates.<eos> Let me guess. You're reading up on Bajoran prophecies concerning the Emissary.<eos> There are hundreds of them.<eos> Most of them are vague, some are contradictory.<eos> But just enough truth in a few of them to make me wonder.<eos> You mean some of them have come true?
That procedure has not been tested. It cannot be predicted.<eos> The buffer is depolarizing.<eos> Computer, this is a command priority override.<eos> Wipe all computer memory necessary in order to save the patterns from the buffer.<eos> Authorization: Eddington- zero-six-five-alpha enabled.<eos> Executing command override.<eos> Tricorder.<eos> The buffer's lost coherence.<eos> The patterns are gone.<eos> Did the computer save them in time?
I know that Murphy is seeing one of the Delaney sisters.<eos> Not since Harry and Tom Paris made their move.<eos> Harry... and the Delaney sisters?<eos> - He would have told me.<eos> - Some things he keeps to himself.<eos> Harry, is it true about you and the Delaney sisters?<eos> - Is what true?<eos> - Come on, Harry, there are no secrets on a ship this small.<eos> What have you been telling people?<eos> - We did go to Venice with them.
Disengage nucleonic beam.<eos> Fire thrusters.<eos> Thrusters engaged.<eos> Now, Mr. Paris.<eos> 40,000 kilometers to the perimeter. 30,000.<eos> The life-form's regeneration rate is up 40 percent, Captain.<eos> Looks like it's well on the way to closing that wound.<eos> We've cleared the central mass.<eos> Captain's Log, supplemental.<eos> We set out to augment our energy reserves and wound up depleting them by over 20 percent.
He was here, Scully; I was right about that.<eos> All right, where does this leave us?<eos> Maybe with enough to identify the killer.<eos> How?<eos> He was here last night. He was also probably here on March 17 and 31.<eos> Those are the dates that Margaret Wysnecki and Patrick Newirth disappeared.<eos> That leaves us with three days of train station videotapes to cross-reference and hopefully find out who this guy is.<eos> That's assuming we're looking for a guy.<eos> Either way, the security camera's our only witness.<eos> It could be any one of these people, Mulder. Or none of them.
Your people came and wiped it out...<eos> and me... as you commanded.<eos> - Did you know ? I had a name ?<eos> - I didn't do this.<eos> My name is Mesmer.<eos> - My wife's name... - I'm sorry.<eos> Sorry ?<eos> Sorry to know my name ?<eos> Oh, that's right. Your victims were always faceless.<eos> You never knew much about them, did you ?
I paid three quid for this !<eos> It's bad enough two juveniles like us having to pay full price !<eos> Calm down.<eos> They're just letting more people on.<eos> What ? Oh, yes, yes, I knew that.<eos> Maybe it's those birds that have been following us around all night !<eos> - What birds ?<eos> - No, no !<eos> Don't look !<eos> It'll show them that we fancy them and that we're keen.
Maybe it's those birds that have been following us around all night !<eos> - What birds ?<eos> - No, no !<eos> Don't look !<eos> It'll show them that we fancy them and that we're keen.<eos> Yeah, but we are.<eos> Yes, I know that, but we don't want them to know.<eos> - Why not ?<eos> - Because they'll know we fancy them.<eos> Then we'll get off with them, go back to their place and do it on them.
Pai Fukuo, you may never claim him as your son.<eos> I will teach him everything I know about the martial arts.<eos> Maybe you'll even meet him one day.<eos> I've had this sword for years.<eos> My stepfather said that one day I must use it to kill Pai Fukuo.<eos> Let me give you some advice.<eos> A drawn sword is meant for killing.<eos> Why don't we come here more often?<eos> I'd like to come back more often when the flowers are in bloom.<eos> But then you probably wouldn't miss them anymore.
Receipts? What about receipts?<eos> There's gotta be receipts.<eos> That was pretty impressive, what you did at the apartment.<eos> You don't have to tell me.<eos> I was there.<eos> Maybe you should've joined the police force, become a real detective.<eos> I don't do humans.<eos> You really love animals.<eos> If it gets cold enough.<eos> No, I have a kinship with them.
- Where are my kitty cats?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Don't worry about it. It's all gonna be out of here and back to normal.<eos> Here it shows these girls talking about how one of their friends... got a date with Skutch and how envious they all are.<eos> This is how I felt about it.<eos> I'm a little bitter about it, as you can see.<eos> I show here how I thought that most teenage boys... are very cruel and aggressive.<eos> And if girls could see that I was more kind and sensitive, they would like me.<eos> They were kind of impressed by the fact I could draw. I couldn't understand why they liked these cruel, aggressive guys and not me.<eos> I was more kind and sensitive, more like them.
I don't want to!<eos> I can't!<eos> I can't!<eos> Don't be afraid, it's just ignis fatuus.<eos> Why here? Why on your poor husband's grave?<eos> I've never kept anything from him... We trusted each other implicitly.<eos> He would have liked to know.<eos> Well, if that's the case...<eos> All these lights!<eos> Let them watch.
And I`m good.<eos> I just did a play in Hollywood and Victor Crowley himself praised its realism.<eos> There`s about 500 guys in this town that can say the same thing.<eos> On the phone you said you had some special qualifications?<eos> Mr. Weiss...<eos> I have never told anyone... what I`m about to tell you... but I really want this job.<eos> I like to dress in women`s clothing.<eos> - You`re a fruit?<eos> - No, not at all. I love women.<eos> Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
Analyzing the personality of the Yamanote Line Murderer?<eos> Or... - you want me to do it Or is this part of the questioning?<eos> It's ironical<eos> Our reunion after 8 years is again related to a serial killing<eos> There is no such thing as random killing<eos> That was your hypothesis<eos> The current serial killing can't be indiscriminate<eos> There must be some common factor<eos> I see the three victims had it coming because they possessed a certain feeling<eos> A strong feeling of self-destruction to lure the killer to them
What... what is it... what is it that gives a schoolgirl her special innocence?<eos> Is it the way they smell?<eos> The sweet smell of their perfume or their hair?<eos> The aroma of fresh flowers... and all that other stuff that has been fucked up by late nights and a lot of bad food?<eos> ls it their gestures?<eos> And the way they move? The way...<eos> The way their body still holds on to some semblance of self-respect and... and dignity?<eos> When they wrap their beautiful legs around you, tight, holding on, looking at you, you looking at them. It's just...<eos> Or is it whatever comes out of their cute little mouths, all those questions, all that wondering?<eos> It's just, you know, they got their whole lives ahead of them, you know?
You must look after her, and be kind to her.<eos> Always.<eos> Mother!<eos> How is the imminent arrival?<eos> Oh, a little frisky today.<eos> When you were a little boy, you used to chase fireflies in the field.<eos> Yes, and when I'd trap them in my jar, they died.<eos> - Do you remember how you cried?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Because you wanted to keep them glowing by your bedside... to light you as you read.
It's a letter from the school, from Miss Stewart.<eos> What does Old Stu want?<eos> She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate, she doesn't think you'll get school certificate. Who cares?<eos> I care, and your father cares.<eos> We want you to get a good education. I'm educating myself.<eos> You're failing English!<eos> You used to be the top of the class!<eos> I'm doing my own writing!<eos> Don't think these stories are going to get you school certificate!<eos> You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them? What would you know?
It's glass to glass. Mitered. The seam virtually disappears.<eos> My wife loved this song.<eos> We used to dance to this music.<eos> So Ginny tells me you're in the mining business.<eos> Mining, yes. Mostly mining.<eos> She mentioned a deal in the Cascades.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I don't have to tell you how iffy these things are, but frankly a deal this good...<eos> As I was telling your wife my partner and I have staked four claims in the mountains.<eos> Named them after Sonya and her sister.
We're gonna work together.<eos> Don't worry, I've got some money for you.<eos> What if we don't want to help?<eos> Reuben?<eos> - Hey, Ma.<eos> I haven't had much to say.<eos> You were always so quiet.<eos> Aw, so introverted.<eos> You don't go out with girls?<eos> Uh, none of them will go out with me.
We gave them out as fast as we made them.<eos> Now, Miss Amy, what's in my pocket?<eos> Father!<eos> "Dearest family. I am well and safe."<eos> "Our battalion is encamped on the Potomac."<eos> "December is cold for us, so far from home."<eos> "I think of my girls day and night.<eos> It comforts me."<eos> "I pray your own hardships may not be too great. Give them my love."<eos> "tell them I think of them by day, pray for them by night."
But you'll be unemployed tomorrow.<eos> No, I don't want anything.<eos> I'll miss you, Mario.<eos> I'll miss you.<eos> But you will write to me?<eos> Of course.<eos> Things change all the time in my country.<eos> Today they'll let me go back.<eos> Tomorrow something else will happen and I'll have to flee again.<eos> I'll leave some things here anyway... if you could keep an eye on them for me.
You must admit it is really, rather fantastic. I agree.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well look, I haven't come here to debate the plausibility of your story.<eos> I bailed you out because I happen to thin you're innocent.<eos> So. What is it that you're not telling me?<eos> [Man] I mean this guy, he's going full speed, and you know it's high pursuit, also right in the middle of nowhere he just stops! Excuse me?<eos> Hi, I'm looking for Rick Myers.<eos> Could you wait over there?<eos> Alright, so how old are these puppets then?<eos> Toulon died shortly after the war. So that's got to make them at least 50 years old, maybe more.
I know I'll never forget it.<eos> I especially enjoyed your dance with the woman who removed her clothes, Mr. Booger.<eos> Trevor, remember there's a code of silence about what goes on at a stag party.<eos> - Code of silence?<eos> - So, reveal nothing... even if you're under hours of interrogation and torture.<eos> Wild horses couldn't drag it out of me.<eos> Who aren't I supposed to tell?<eos> - Huh? There were women there, weren't there?<eos> Were they pretty?<eos> What'd you do with them?
Andy would never do that.<eos> Never.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Every man has his breaking point.<eos> Lickety-split.<eos> Want to get home.<eos> Just about finished, sir.<eos> Three deposits tonight.<eos> Get my stuff down to the laundry.<eos> And shine my shoes. -I want them looking like mirrors. -Yes, sir.
Something for good luck.<eos> I can use it.<eos> We demand justice! We demand justice!<eos> Get back! Get back!<eos> You step aside now!<eos> We demand justice!<eos> We know what you have in there!<eos> - Back off!<eos> - Those antiques are not yours,<eos> - and we won't let them out of China!
- So what?<eos> What is this doing in class?<eos> Showing off?<eos> Who hasn't received love letters before?<eos> "A la fin tu es las de ce monde ancien<eos> "Bergère ô tour Eiffel le troupeau des ponts bêle ce matin"<eos> The American airline industry is going through a recession.<eos> This is a golden opportunity for us to bid for the Sydney to Bangkok routes which the British are also eyeing.<eos> They will be our toughest competition, and the fight will be fierce.<eos> I'll be able to put a price on these routes within two weeks and I feel that there is significant potential in all of them.
Were spent with the 1,500 women of the sultan's harem.<eos> Come.<eos> Come to me, my little cockatoo.<eos> At the end of two years... I noticed that I didn't have the same enthusiasm as before.<eos> This could be a problem.<eos> You may rise, my little dove.<eos> All good things must come to an end.<eos> Gulbeyaz, sensing the danger to us both... arranged for me to depart within the hour.<eos> I had learned to love in a thousand ways... each one a lesson in the soul of a woman.<eos> I knew I would miss every one of them.
I related the sad tale of my Doña Julia... never guessing for a moment... that my sweet Doña Ana believed I had saved myself for her... as she had for me.<eos> Very well, my love.<eos> I will accept that I am not the first... if you will tell me with the same honesty... how many others there have been.<eos> This would have been a very good time for me to lie... but truth is a terrible habit.<eos> Including you... there have been... Exactly... One... thousand five hundred and two.<eos> I could see that this was a sum substantially greater... than the one she had in mind... and not easy for her to assimilate, try as she might.<eos> As her pain struck at my heart like a dagger... I begged to be forgiven.<eos> I removed my mask as a gesture of remorse... but it was to no avail.<eos> To hide her humiliation... she took up the mask and left me forever.<eos> And so my adventures came to an end... and with them, the chance that one day... like my father... I would die in the arms of the woman I loved.
Use the mind probe.<eos> You know how.<eos> Cheer up.<eos> It's not so bad.<eos> After you're done, you'll be free.<eos> Mollari will have his memories and I'll have the Centauri Empire by its mighty throat.<eos> Open.<eos> Star Laces!<eos> I haven't seen these since I left Davo.<eos> Where did you get them?
You're right.<eos> Last time it was me.<eos> God, who can keep it all straight anymore?<eos> I was thinking of you the other day. Wondering what you were doing.<eos> - I think of you in summer.<eos> - I think of you in the fall.<eos> We never could agree on anything.<eos> I still have your letters. The long battles, the brief truces.<eos> The longer silences punctuated by moments of passion... that we both end up regretting.<eos> I read them to remind myself why we shouldn't get together again.
- Really, Brucie a man of your social standing needs a woman like me to keep you in step with the latest trends.<eos> Who dresses you anyway?<eos> Alfred?<eos> Well, actually...<eos> Excuse me, miss.<eos> You can't bring those things in here.<eos> It's okay.<eos> They're housebroken.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Wow, I never saw them do that before.
Larry ran a red light.<eos> He was trying to beat it.<eos> I told him to stop, but he said he could make it.<eos> Oh, Andy.<eos> How awful.<eos> Sweetie.<eos> Thank God you're all right.<eos> I never said you were boring.<eos> You implied it. You're an extremely dynamic individual, especially in those glasses.<eos> -What's wrong with them?
What were my nieces and nephews doing here?<eos> Yeah, they were coming to plead your brother Harrison's job.<eos> I guess none of them good salesmen either, huh?<eos> You're beginning to scare me.<eos> Can I adopt you?<eos> Hey, Pete, do you remember November 6, 1987?<eos> How can I forget?<eos> That's the day I set the sales record for the entire Southern California area.<eos> I sold 11 cars.<eos> Well, 10. One of them had an exploding gas tank.
You're not going to close the lid on me, are you?<eos> Not till I know you better.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> Where's the gun?<eos> - There ain't no gun!<eos> Your brother's in hospital, he nearly died, doesn't that mean anything to you?<eos> Next time it'll be one your sisters.<eos> Could you live with that?<eos> If you don't give a damn about your life, think of your sisters!<eos> Think about them.
A witness in the Marilyn Callisto murder?<eos> Mm-hm.<eos> What'd they say?<eos> As usual... he was silent.<eos> That's too bad, because we could use a break in this case, Frank.<eos> Three young women, all killed within the last 48 hours, all in the exact same manner.<eos> We're due a break, huh?<eos> You got any background on Callisto?<eos> Well, she used to take in these teenage, pregnant street girls.<eos> She believed in them, she redeemed them and just like Goodrich and Lundy, she was a good Catholic who used all of her time and energies to help others.
He peels off my cloths like a starving man would peel an orange.<eos> - His lips taste my juicy...<eos> - Juicy.<eos> I refuse to read this.<eos> His lips taste my juicy sweetness.<eos> My legs tangle with his.<eos> We become one being.<eos> A burning furnace... in the cold cement basement of love.<eos> Hormones.<eos> What would we do without them?
-They work there, yes, sir.<eos> But listen to this, lieutenant.<eos> Our theory is that this guy is at the wig outlet... ... buyingstuffforhis backup girlfriend.<eos> -There is no backup girlfriend.<eos> -Then who is the wig for?<eos> For him.<eos> The wig and the fingernails are for him.<eos> He's in the store for six hours trying on wigs and fingernails.<eos> And these girls are helping him with his makeover.<eos> One of them he sends out. She's getting him dressed from the Big and Tall Girls shop.
So what is it, Scully?<eos> What are we dealing with?<eos> Without better imaging equipment I can't say for sure.<eos> I'll take any theory you've got.<eos> It appears to be some kind of a fungus.<eos> Anything you recognize?<eos> Well, I'm not a botanist, but it's fair to guess that it's an unknown genus.<eos> - What am I lookin' at here?<eos> - Spores...<eos> I scraped them off the tip of the fungus.
The sun comes and floods this empty room<eos> I call it my room My room has welcomed many summers<eos> Embraced laughter and tears Can it fìll itself with your laughter<eos> Each word a sunbeam Glancing in the light This is the song of My Room Blue stretches yawns<eos> and is awake. (sussurrando) Paul.<eos> (sussurrando) Howard.<eos> There is a photo in the newspaper this morning of refugees leaving Bosnia.<eos> They look out of time.<eos> Peasant women with scarves and black dresses stepped from the pages of an older Europe.<eos> One of them has lost her three children.
I don't know who the fuck Claire is!<eos> I gave you an actress who just got her throat fucking cut, okay?<eos> Will you shut up and listen to me a second?<eos> You're not going to die, all right?<eos> Listen, Sarah, you're a very famous person. And people follow what you do.<eos> Now, do you expect young girls... Do you want young girls to do what you do as Claire?<eos> To let this fucking brute beat you?<eos> Shut up!<eos> Do you expect young girls to allow...<eos> Is that what you wanna teach them... to let this fucking brute beat you 'cause you believe in God?
Oh... there's a slaughter going on, all right, but it ain't the fat ladies that are getting it.<eos> Your hired hands are killing the cattle.<eos> The cattle?<eos> They're killing the cows?<eos> That's what they said, Miss Adrian.<eos> How dare you slaughter the Countess' cattle?<eos> What's a ranch without cows?<eos> We're replacing them with goats.<eos> The cows are diseased and in pain.<eos> We're just putting them out of their misery.
He invited me home.<eos> To his place?<eos> David, he wanted something else!<eos> Shit, man, this is serious!<eos> He showed me some foreign books... you can't find anywhere.<eos> He used them as bait...<eos> And you went?<eos> To see if he was into something.<eos> His place is full of weird things... strange sculptures...<eos> I don't know, there's something fishy about them.
We've been living together for five years.<eos> Simon led you astray?<eos> How could it happen?<eos> Nobody led me astray.<eos> I was born this way.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> You had girlfriends in college.<eos> Jean.<eos> Lei Lei.<eos> You were intimate with them.
My dear, you are unjust!<eos> Forsake these senseless fancies<eos> You are tormenting yourself with these suspicions!<eos> Your tortured soul is distraught and blinded by passion<eos> Maria, believe me, I Iove you<eos> Maria, believe me, I Iove you more than glory, more than power<eos> It is not true, you are playing false with me<eos> Were we not for a Iong time inseparable?<eos> Now you avoid my caresses<eos> And you find them tiresome
If you're crazy about money, why don't you ask your wife to be whore?<eos> Come over...<eos> Captain Lui, you've good memory<eos> You still remember she was once a whore<eos> A whore and a pimper, what a perfect couple<eos> Now I'll sue to have indecent proposal Which affect the society therelationshipbetween2sex<eos> Really?<eos> I don't know<eos> The girls come to watch movie, I can't control what they do<eos> If you suspect them, you may catch them
When I was abroad, the only thing I could think of was you.<eos> How I missed you...<eos> And what do you want now?<eos> I can help you financially.<eos> I only think of you, Ema.<eos> I will do anything for you, Ema.<eos> You don't know the love I feel for you. How I need you.<eos> Caires, you won't cut your wisdom teeth.<eos> Get up and leave.<eos> My daughters will be here any second and I don't want them to see you like that.
Why do you want to go to Russia?<eos> Oh, by the way, you'll have to lend me a tie.<eos> Professor Wittgenstein, on behalf of the Institute for Foreign Relations, I can offer you two things.<eos> The chair in philosophy at Kazan University or a teaching post in philosophy at Moscow University.<eos> Er, comrade, please. I don't want to teach.<eos> I want to work as a manual labourer, either in a factory or on a collective farm.<eos> Chto?<eos> I'm terribly sorry, Professor Wittgenstein, but this is absolutely out of the question.<eos> The one thing that is not in short supply in the Soviet Union is unskilled labour.<eos> Da, da, Professor. We must teach the frozen circumstances to sing by playing them their own melody.
And you want me to teach you to paint.<eos> Why did you choose me?<eos> Because there's no one else here.<eos> Good.<eos> Anna?<eos> Don't you think you're a bit young for love?<eos> She has one of my ribs.<eos> One of your ribs...<eos> Women have had every part of me.<eos> And I've possessed every part of them.
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE BELIEVABLE.<eos> BUT NOT POETIC.<eos> ALL OPERAS ARE FILLED WITH LOVESICK MARTYRS WHO END UP DYING.<eos> THAT'S WHAT OPERA'S ALL ABOUT.<eos> LOVE AND DEATH.<eos> LOVE AND DEATH. I LIKE THAT.<eos> SOMETIMES I THINK MY OWN LIFE IS LIKE AN OPERA...<eos> OR AT LEAST MY RELATIONSHIPS WITH WOMEN.<eos> I LIKE STRONG WOMEN.<eos> I LIKE ALL WOMEN. BUT I SEEM TO BRING OUT THE WORST IN THEM.
Well, unfortunately, she got a headache.<eos> Skull fracture.<eos> Brain hemorrhage.<eos> Vomit indicates that she did not go quickly.<eos> Any idea what she hit?<eos> Uh, something flat and solid.<eos> A wall or a headboard.<eos> It left abrasions on the skin.<eos> No external bleeding.<eos> A couple of drunks on a bed with hot pants, one of them cracks her skull on the headboard.
Wrong, Counselor.<eos> And we got his prints on a bag of crack at the scene.<eos> Prints, huh?<eos> You know how I usually handle that?<eos> He bought a sandwich, threw the bag away, and then somebody filled it with crack.<eos> Let's talk to the DA.<eos> You're runnir on empty, Paul.<eos> The fingerprints are a coincidence?<eos> On a plastic bag, yes.<eos> You don't have them on a gun.
By the time I found out, it didn't matter.<eos> Barbara took such good care of herself.<eos> When was the last time you saw her?<eos> (Gregg) I have an opening next week.<eos> I worked till midnight.<eos> I spoke to her about 10:00.<eos> She was fine.<eos> This guy's a designer.<eos> Do we even know if he likes girls?<eos> He likes them enough to ask one to move in with him.
It'll take a second.<eos> You gotta hear this.<eos> Tell these detectives what you told me.<eos> Well, I was waiting at a bus stop when two women offered me a lift home.<eos> They were young, attractive, very friendly, so naturally I accepted.<eos> -Go on, then what?<eos> -They drove under Westside highway. They parked there and ordered me to remove my clothes at gunpoint.<eos> You're not gonna believe this.<eos> I was humiliated.<eos> They forced me to, you know, pleasure one of them.
I don't know.<eos> Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction.<eos> - Tell him that I am mad at him.<eos> - All right.<eos> So where you cooking now?<eos> - Pfieffer's.<eos> - Oh, the power-lunch crowd.<eos> Nice shoes.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Where did you get them?
Am I that charming and beautiful?<eos> No. No, you're not.<eos> - Why do I keep setting you up?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Ever since this new owner took over, the service here is really slow. Yeah.<eos> Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?<eos> They're putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that.<eos> Besides that.<eos> Look at the waitresses.<eos> What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?
Hey! There's something you don't see in a toilet every day.<eos> Anybody lose their glasses?<eos> Last chance.<eos> The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle... is equal to the square root of the remaining side.<eos> - That's a right triangle, ya idiot! - D'oh!<eos> Thank you so much for visiting our plant, Dr. Kissinger.<eos> - It was fun.<eos> - We'll let you know if your glasses turn up.<eos> Uh, yes. Well, I'm sure I left them in the car.<eos> No one must know I dropped them in the toilet.
His calendar shows he was with me at the time of the murder.<eos> Only a shape-shifter could get into the holosuite.<eos> As I'd be called there after the body was discovered, my DNA is at the crime scene.<eos> Do you have any kind of alibi?<eos> I have to return to my natural state every 18 hours to regenerate.<eos> To be honest, I was in a pail in the back of my office when lbudan was killed.<eos> The killer might have known that and planned the murder accordingly.<eos> Like I said, a neat package.<eos> Who might want to frame you?<eos> I can think of about 500 different people, but I haven't seen any of them around the station recently.
Do you think we can communicate with it?<eos> We already have.<eos> It's part and parcel of our computer now.<eos> It may not be capable of direct communication.<eos> We haven't seen any evidence that it is sentient.<eos> Maybe more like a stray puppy that's attached itself to you, Chief.<eos> It's disabling our station.<eos> We've got to get it out of there.<eos> It came here when we downloaded the probe's files.<eos> If we upload those same files back to the probe, it might go with them.
Your engineers can play with the machines.<eos> I'm sending out search parties.<eos> Eat hearty.<eos> The replicators crash in 16 minutes.<eos> This will have to last.<eos> Combat rations, Chief?<eos> Couldn't you have replicated something more palatable?<eos> French onion soup would have been nice.<eos> A miracle of science, these combat rations.<eos> All the nutrients the body needs for three days. I love them.
- You, Deanna.<eos> Maybe you.<eos> - Yes?<eos> You must...<eos> - How can I explain?<eos> - Tell me telepathically.<eos> Maques believes my mother's psyche has collapsed in on itself, that she has retreated into her metaconscious mind.<eos> - Was he trying to contact her?<eos> - Yes.<eos> He was able to access images generated by her metaconscious but could make no sense of them.
I'm curious.<eos> Why are you ignoring the one emotion you've already experienced?<eos> Why aren't you trying to make yourself angry again?<eos> Anger is negative.<eos> I wanted to concentrate on something positive.<eos> Data, feelings aren't positive and negative, they simply exist.<eos> It's what we do with them that becomes good or bad.<eos> For example, feeling angry about an injustice could lead someone to take a positive action to correct it.<eos> But my study of humanity indicates that some emotions are harmful, such as jealousy or hatred.<eos> Those are very strong emotions and you're right, very little good can come from them.
I SUPPOSE WHAT'S MOST ENTHRALLING ABOUT THE BOX OF DEATH IS HOW REALISTIC IT SEEMS.<eos> I MEAN, FOR AN INSTANT<eos> NO, THEY DO.<eos> AND I JUST CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER HOW YOU DID IT.<eos> IT'S REALLY QUITE SIMPLE, MY DARLING.<eos> THERE IS A DOUBLE DOOR, OF COURSE, RIGHT?<eos> AND THIS FALSE PANEL PUSHES BACK 1O INCHES. WHEN MY ASSISTANT CLOSES THE DOOR, I PUSH MYSELF BACK, AND I AM OUT OF HARM'S WAY.<eos> SO WHEN THE BLADES COME IN, YOU'RE...<eos> I'M QUITE SAFE, MY DARLING. JA, JA.<eos> I JUST STEP BETWEEN THEM.
Yeah.<eos> Okay, what's it gonna be, up or down?<eos> Sergeant, could you just check the height?<eos> That looks about the right height.<eos> - Good luck, my Belgian friends.<eos> - Good luck.<eos> What will it be then?<eos> Losers buy the winners a round of beer.<eos> Oh, lousy British.<eos> You fight like girls and you bet like them, too.
- Can you verify that?<eos> - Yes, Mr Hart was by Mr Roberts' side.<eos> Witnesses say that Mr Hart wrestled the gunman to the ground and took quick action to save Mr Roberts' life.<eos> Is there a political motive in this crime?<eos> Yes.<eos> That possibility has not been ruled out.<eos> Theirs is a fool's game and those that play<eos> Will find their hands tied And their hearts dry<eos> Prevailing tides will drown you<eos> Unless you learn to swim against them
You know?<eos> She wanted to make love with other women.<eos> She got into dope for a while. She'd break that thing that you sniff when she'd have her orgasm.<eos> I was getting a real education.<eos> I was fascinated. I was absolutely nuts about her.<eos> And ultimately she wound up in an institution.<eos> I mean, it's not funny, it was a very sad thing.<eos> She was great, but nuts.<eos> See, I've always had this penchant for what I call "kamikaze women."<eos> I call them kamikazes because they crash their plane. They crash it into you, and you die with them.
Mom.<eos> You' re not in love with Dad, are you?<eos> No, not any more.<eos> But I have you.<eos> - I love you. - Come on.<eos> I ' m sick of omelets.<eos> If it weren't for my Mom, you could count me out.<eos> For what we get...<eos> Omelets interest you more than I do.<eos> It's your fault, you make them so well.
No.<eos> I'm going to take her.<eos> I've got your suitcase.<eos> Here's my arm.<eos> Taylor was a cop in San Diego.<eos> He comes up here, hits another girl, then spends months feeding false information into "Jennifer".<eos> Let me tell you about this sick man named John Taylor.<eos> He grows up in an environment of blind children.<eos> His mother is blind, she teaches the blind and he has classes with blind girls.<eos> He's a boy, so he's attracted to them.
Come on!<eos> My piglet.<eos> Are you mommy's girl?<eos> My life!<eos> Well, she came up with the idea... Of me taking the high school equivalency exam... So I could keep the business.<eos> Believe it or not, I actually passed the thing. And then we decided to expand.<eos> So we borrowed a little bit of money from her parents... And, uh, bought a whole 'nother district.<eos> Yeah, she's a clever girl.<eos> Women.<eos> If it weren't for them, there'd be no civilization.
- We've got the original.<eos> Your son must be growing up.<eos> He's seven now.<eos> I'll show you a photo.<eos> - We've been waiting.<eos> - We were in Shenzhen.<eos> - I've got some good stuff. - Is it any good?<eos> Don't pay if it's no good.<eos> I can't find it.<eos> One shot and the cops won't know what's hit them.
I know.<eos> One has to reason with these colonials to get them to do anything.<eos> Tiring, isn't it? But that's the lay of the land.<eos> I thought British policy is 'Make the world England,' sir.<eos> I see you're to serve with the 35th Regiment of Foot at Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro.<eos> I'll be marching the 60th to Fort Edward.<eos> Explain to the Major, he has little to fear from this General Marquis de Montcalm in the first place, and therefore scent need of a colonial militia in the second, because the French haven't the nature for war.<eos> Their Latinate voluptuousness... they'd rather eat and make love with their faces than fight.<eos> Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters?<eos> I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort, sir.
Look at this crowd.<eos> This is great!<eos> They're jumping, cheering and they paid to get in.<eos> You did a fabulous job.<eos> I won't forget this.<eos> Thank you very much, Mr. Harvey.<eos> I appreciate it, coming from you.<eos> But to be perfectly honest, I think the girls deserve most of the credit.<eos> They're great.<eos> Fortunately, we won't need them anymore.
We're going to take all of these baby books to the children's hospital.<eos> It's time for the big stuff.<eos> Something heroic.<eos> There you go.<eos> You gotta tell us what you want.<eos> The Once and Future King by TH White.<eos> "The boy slept well in the woodland nest, where he had laid himself down."<eos> "At first, he only dipped below the surface of sleep... and skimmed along like a salmon in shallow water,... so close to the surface that he fancied himself in air."<eos> "He thought himself awake, when he was already asleep."<eos> "He saw the stars above his face,... whirling on their silent and sleepless axis,... and the leaves of the trees rustling against them."
- And you leave the sardines.<eos> - I leave the sardines?<eos> You leave the sardines.<eos> I hang up the phone and I leave the sardines?<eos> Right!<eos> - We've changed that, have we, dear?<eos> - No, dear.<eos> - That's what I've always been doing?<eos> - I wouldn't say that, Dotty.<eos> How about the words? Am I getting some of them right?
- Like a baby.<eos> And white. An old man...<eos> with nothing-<eos> - Nothing to lose.<eos> - Nothing to lose. All you got to do is want it... bad enough.<eos> Like an old suit.<eos> My wife and daughter had a bond.<eos> I loved them both so much I wanted to eat them alive.<eos> Women make a life... inside their body.<eos> And that life comes out and holds onto them.
They said no.<eos> They said they're going to repossess your truck.<eos> You haven't paid up in the last two weeks, they don't care.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I have to go now.<eos> He's coming back, Mike.<eos> It's not Mom's fault... but he's coming back.<eos> Fire!<eos> I could be one of those girls.<eos> - No, you're prettier than them, Mom.
- I love this song.<eos> We had a lovely time. We'll be back. - Yes, we will.<eos> Good night.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> This turns into a nuns' bar, I'm out of here.<eos> The sisters have made clear to me that they followed you of their own volition.<eos> But they would never have ventured out at all at night had it not been for your example.<eos> Listen, they just don't want to be stuck behind these walls all the time.<eos> These walls are the only protection they have.<eos> The streets are no longer safe for them.
"Every life is a trash can among whose garbage we have to look out what that person ought to have been."<eos> Do you want me to deal with her? - No.<eos> In with anger, out with love.<eos> You still here, darling?<eos> - I have to give you your present<eos> Oh presents, yes!<eos> It's my birthday, I get presents!<eos> Already I got this gorgeous pair, pair... Where's the other one gone?<eos> Down the toilet, Ed.<eos> - Oh I didn't like them anyway.
And that may prove difficult, considering this entire laboratory has been rigged to destroy you.<eos> And in case you think that once I go, my disorienting effect will go with me think again.<eos> I've planted duplicate vertigo devices throughout the room to maintain the effect once I've departed.<eos> Goodbye and good luck.<eos> You'll need it.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - My contact lenses.<eos> I lost them when we fell.<eos> They counter the distortion effect.<eos> Without them, I'm as helpless as you.
-What?<eos> Look, come on, uncle phil.<eos> I mean, I'm sure you did something like this when you were a kid.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> I think you two owe hilary an apology.<eos> Your behavior tonight cost her an invitation to join the Diamond League... and meet some nice young men... and you know how much that meant to me.<eos> I mean, her.<eos> It's okay, Daddy.<eos> The more time I spent with those women... the more I realized they're not my kind of people.<eos> I don't want to have anything to do with them.
A woman is reconceived with products custom-blended to her skin.<eos> So you're telling me you couldn't get this stuff at any old drugstore?<eos> Never.<eos> You keep records of the women you reconceive?<eos> Records that are confidential.<eos> I won't embarrass our clients.<eos> Suzanne, let's pretend we're on the same horse, all right?<eos> You don't want us to have to call all of your clients, do you?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Well, unless you give us the information, we'll have to get it from them.
We are also lonely.<eos> What is Geordi doing?<eos> I'm studying the components in your prosthesis.<eos> Why?<eos> We're trying to learn more about you.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you're different than we are.<eos> Part of what we do is learn more about other species.<eos> We assimilate species.<eos> Then we know everything about them.
In a way, you're very lucky.<eos> You might have a chance to do what most people only dream about.<eos> Have a second childhood without the pain of growing up again.<eos> This is Capt Picard's rybo-viroxic-nucleic structure from a tissue sample I took this morning.<eos> It's the same as a sample I took before the accident, except it's missing several of the key viroxic sequences.<eos> It's been a long time since I took genetics, Doctor.<eos> RVN is one of the key factors in our development during puberty.<eos> Unlike DNA, which never changes, RVN takes on additional sequences during adolescence.<eos> Those sequences determine how we develop physically.<eos> - Without them we wouldn't mature?
We think we can close the rupture with a coherent graviton pulse.<eos> We have to do that at the source.<eos> - How do we find the source? - Good question.<eos> The emissions come from a tertiary subspace domain, but subspace has an infinite number of domains.<eos> It's a huge honeycomb with an infinite number of cells.<eos> We need to isolate the exact cell these emissions come from.<eos> If someone homed on to the subspace signals created by our modified signal array, could we do the same to them?<eos> Track the tetryon emissions to their universe?<eos> Tetryon particles have a random momentum.<eos> Our sensors cannot track them.
Is it too much to ask for a bit of service?<eos> We must be quiet.<eos> The external examiner needs to rest before we proceed with the exam.<eos> Let me give you a piece of advice, Herr Kessler.<eos> In my opinion, you have only one option.<eos> As soon as Herr Seifert wakes up, ask him to accompany you as you go through the train and apologize to each one of the travellers.<eos> Think it over.<eos> Conductor!<eos> Those shoes have not been polished!<eos> Although I wanted them to be polished!
She'll be screwing them when she's 14.<eos> Watch your mouth.<eos> You let her wear so much makeup she looks like a goddamn raccoon.<eos> I thought she was a burglar.<eos> I almost shot her twice.<eos> You're not funny.<eos> Girls wear makeup.<eos> I'm sure they don't put it on with a paint sprayer.<eos> For your information, a lot of people think I'm very funny.<eos> Go live with them.
That's the last time you see him alive?<eos> We have to go.<eos> I'm winning.<eos> We have to go now. Come on.<eos> I was playing nine and won.<eos> Instead of changing numbers, I let it ride. lt was unbelievable!<eos> The guy said I was on a roll. I'm never lucky.<eos> - Unbelievable!<eos> - Give me the keys.<eos> Oh, that's right. I have them in my pocket.
He stepped on a beehive.<eos> I told him not to tease those bees.<eos> Did he get stung?<eos> Maybe I should go over and yell at him.<eos> No, sweetheart.<eos> You can't.<eos> Why not?<eos> He was allergic to bees.<eos> He's okay, isn't he?<eos> There were just too many of them.
Uncle Artie?<eos> I have to get dressed first.<eos> Here.<eos> What time is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Uncle Artie's sleepy.<eos> - Do you always get up this early, hon?<eos> I'm gonna take you to a nice place for breakfast.<eos> What about my sisters?<eos> Aunt Rita will take care of them when they get up.
Cute as these kids are, we'll find them a home real soon.<eos> If you could put them up for a week or two, we'll be making it happen.<eos> We're moving them to my apartment tonight, but it's small.<eos> You know, we're crammed in there ourselves.<eos> There's a priest who runs a shelter at Immaculate Heart church.<eos> He's a little jammed right now, but maybe he'll take them in.<eos> We had 27 kids sleep here last night.<eos> We had to keep the heat, the electric on.<eos> That's gonna kill us at the end of the month.<eos> Let me ask you something. Say I bring my partner's kids here. What might happen to them?
We had to keep the heat, the electric on.<eos> That's gonna kill us at the end of the month.<eos> Let me ask you something. Say I bring my partner's kids here. What might happen to them?<eos> - Three of them, right? - Right.<eos> Well, we'd move them out into a baby boarder home pretty quick.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's kind of a... halfway house for kids waiting for foster placement.<eos> How long might they have to stay there?<eos> That's hard to say.<eos> Especially with three of them.
Did you give yourself this name?<eos> It's a joke!<eos> Azeem the Great One, I am home!<eos> Look!<eos> Mistletoe!<eos> Many a maid has lost her resolve to me thanks to this!<eos> In my country, we talk to our women.<eos> We do not drug them with plants.<eos> What do you know of women?<eos> Where I come from, Christian there are women of such beauty they can possess a man's mind so that he would willingly die for them.
This is a ruling-class man... and he's actually suffering from oxygen deprivation.<eos> He's brain-dead. Can I sell you a shirt?<eos> You know?<eos> And it's like, look at this magazine.<eos> Buy this magazine.<eos> You might be able to stimulate some thought in yourself... you know, switch your gestalt so that you might have some perception... and be able to see our way out of this.<eos> Alleviate suffering, make us enjoy it or something, you know.<eos> I mean, we're walking around here right now, and it's really time for us to take action.<eos> We're being taxed out of our asses... to pay for a monopoly on guns by people to oppress us already.<eos> I'm saying if I'm gonna pay taxes on guns and weapons... that I at least wanna possess them, because I have work for them right now.
"How much choice did God have... in constructing the universe?"<eos> If my proposal that the universe has no boundary is correct... he had no freedom at all... to choose how the universe began.<eos> He would only have had the freedom... to choose the laws the universe obeyed.<eos> This, however, may not have been... all that much of a choice.<eos> There may well be only one unified theory... that allows for the existence of structures... as complicated as human beings... who can investigate the laws of the universe... and ask about the nature of God.<eos> I don't know how clear-cut these experiments are... but there are experiments that have been done on the timing of consciousness... and they seem to lead to a very odd picture... which doesn't even quite make consistent sense.<eos> Whether refinement of these experiments... might get rid of this kind of anomaly I'm not sure... but it does look a little as though there is something very odd about consciousness... and somehow almost as though the future affects the past in some way... over a very tiny, limited scale, but something maybe of the order... of a reasonable fraction of a second.<eos> And there's no reason to believe... that one's conscious experience... shouldn't be part of somebody else's... at some other stage.<eos> I don't know if it's fair to say what happens after one dies... but it's a plausible picture... that you could be somebody else... and that somebody else could be somebody that lived in the past, not in the future.<eos> Even if there is only one possible unified theory... that is just a set of rules and equations... what is it that breathes fire into the equations... and makes a universe for them to describe?
Stand alongside me.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Don't look now but you're in a ditch.<eos> Now who's smarter?<eos> The horse or the car?<eos> Well, I'm the stupid one.<eos> It serves me right for racing with a young boy.<eos> Now listen, son.<eos> Your eyes are better than mine.<eos> I dropped my glasses and without them...
- Did you say 18?<eos> - No.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> Look at this, Will.<eos> The stock just went up to $18.<eos> You just made me $1 million.<eos> That doesn't mean anything, Mr. Whitworth.<eos> I can understand you being frightened by your powers.<eos> But there are forces at work in the universe beyond our understanding.<eos> Don't fight them, Will.
Nice suit.<eos> You like it, Ash?<eos> Custom-made. Size 42, extra fly.<eos> When you work for Whitworth, you get all the fringe benefits.<eos> Does he need a butler?<eos> Just asking.<eos> For a friend.<eos> Will, you don't really think you're capable of giving financial advice, do you?<eos> Aunt Viv... there are forces at work in this universe that are beyond our understanding.<eos> And if these forces want to give me a limo... a cellular phone, and an Armani suit... who are we to argue with them?
MacGyver, Miss Finnegan, this is Marietta Roblas.<eos> She's helping us coordinate the evidence for Delasora's trial.<eos> Oh, there he is.<eos> Look at him.<eos> He's gained weight on your prison food, while the country, he and his generals looted, is starving.<eos> Even stripped of his power, he's a monster.<eos> How do you view your chance in an American court?<eos> This trial should never have happened.<eos> I was kidnapped from my country by your government, to face these preposterous charges.<eos> But, I am confident that my lawyer will prove them groundless.
Jeez, I don't remember what the guy said.<eos> But I remember it shaped my young life.<eos> What the hell was it?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> You got the gist of it.<eos> The important thing is that, through my God-given charm and Verducciness my master plan is working.<eos> And I got phone numbers shoved in my pocket by every pretty girl in that room.<eos> So I guess what I'm saying is I won't be home nights for about a year.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You're not gonna sleep with any of them till we got a commitment.
-How you doing?<eos> -Hello.<eos> You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk?<eos> Who are you?<eos> How did you do that?<eos> Hennigan's.<eos> I was sitting there in the office, and the cleaning woman comes in.<eos> I've always been attracted to cleaning women.<eos> Cleaning women, chambermaids...<eos> Yeah, chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too.
As I recall, it's not easy to cultivate.<eos> That's just it.<eos> I started these spores right before we were knocked unconscious by the wormhole.<eos> You said we were out for 30 seconds?<eos> Correct.<eos> Then why do these show a full day's growth?<eos> Perhaps you've got a fast-growth strain here.<eos> Each incubator was set with spores from completely different sources in the Diomedian system.<eos> I have more in the lab.<eos> Perhaps something extraordinary happened to one of them, but not to all of them.
But what about you?<eos> Can't worry about me anymore.<eos> I've been a part of all the horrible things that have happened.<eos> I wanna be a part of something good now.<eos> James, go.<eos> Take all the time you need.<eos> I love you.<eos> I'm gonna miss you like crazy.<eos> But you'll go away and you'll come back with great stories.<eos> And none of them are gonna be about Laura or Maddy or Evelyn.
I feel Luther has more than paid his debt to society.<eos> Debt?<eos> Is that like taxes, Ms. Butler?<eos> Very clever. But we're talking about a man's life.<eos> What about the three people he murdered? Has he paid off his debt to them?<eos> That really isn't the issue.<eos> We are trying to rehabilitate prisoners.<eos> Luther wants a second chance.<eos> And the victims' families?<eos> Has he paid off his debt to them, Ms. Butler?
Do you like your new boss? No, I don't.<eos> Did you make the list?<eos> Kate needs a swimsuit, I need notebooks, pens and underwear.<eos> I have 30 minutes for lunch. After we get the shoes, I'll give you money to buy the rest.<eos> I want red ones.<eos> Bright red ones.<eos> With a red strap.<eos> I don't need any.<eos> Charlotte, you're starting school on Monday and those boots aren't.<eos> What's wrong with them?
- Oh, come on!<eos> - No, I'm serious.<eos> They like you and are now counting on you as an escort.<eos> Well, I like them, too, but that doesn't... -<eos> I'm not sure if you realize this, but these girls are at a very vulnerable point in their lives.<eos> All of this is much more emotional and difficult for them than it is for us.<eos> They're on display.<eos> They have to call the guys up and invite them as escorts.<eos> And preppy girls mature socially much later than others do.<eos> For many of them, this is the first serious social life they've had... and if you just disappear now, they're gonna take that as personal rejection.
Will, I bet you can't wait till your mom gets here.<eos> Yeah. Thanks for flying her out, Aunt Viv.<eos> We had to convince her to accept it.<eos> She never lets us spend a penny on her.<eos> Apparently, that's not a genetic trait.<eos> Now, for Thanksgiving... do you want to try something different or the traditional turkey?<eos> Mother, I have a big problem with turkey.<eos> What's wrong with it?<eos> From the moment they're hatched to the moment they're shrink-wrapped... turkeys are raised to be food, and nothing but food.<eos> Hilary, I don't think too many of them had aspirations... to be doctors or lawyers.
Here we are.<eos> Ah, thank you.<eos> When I authenticated them, the pigments were consistent with late 18th century colors, but they weren't mixed with an oil base.<eos> They'd been applied to the canvas with human blood.<eos> Blood?<eos> According to legend, the artist was a prisoner in the Bastille.<eos> The painting disappeared when the Bastille was liberated.<eos> The start of the French Revolution.<eos> But Eby knew all about it.<eos> He claimed the images were so real, you could just step into them.
- He's back!<eos> - Look!<eos> He's washing a car!<eos> Looks like I got some suds on my pants.<eos> Al, stop that.<eos> Mind your own business.<eos> I don't know what they're looking at.<eos> They've never seen flies circle the head of a man before?<eos> No, it's attitude.<eos> I mean, for example let's just say that there's somebody so unattractive in this room that even the girl cats won't let him pet them.
Not necessarily, Doctor.<eos> There is far too little debris to account for an entire shuttlecraft.<eos> So what is it?<eos> You know, Dirgo had his maneuvering thrusters rigged a funny way. Claimed it was more efficient.<eos> If one of them blew it might have left debris that looks like this.<eos> If only one of his thrusters was out he still could have set down somewhere.<eos> The only Class-M planets in the system are Pentarus II and V. Both of which have been thoroughly searched by the miners.<eos> Then we'll search them again.<eos> Sir, there are also four moons in the Pentarus system that could support life.<eos> Have the miners searched them?
He was not wounded in the mishap, but as a representative of the Federation, I require an explanation.<eos> Why has this child been held in your custody for so many years?<eos> No explanation is warranted, Captain.<eos> He is my son.<eos> Captain's log, supplemental.<eos> Capt Endar's claim that Jeremiah is his son is unacceptable.<eos> However, to avoid escalating tensions, I have invited the Talarian leader to come aboard so that we may address the issue face to face.<eos> I was in charge of the force that repelled the trespassers on Galen IV.<eos> I must say your Federation troops fought tenaciously.<eos> Among them, Connor and Moira Rossa.
Laura said you were very fair-minded.<eos> If you knew her so well, why didn't she ever mention you to me?<eos> Well, Laura liked to think of me as a mystery in her life.<eos> Then why did you call me?<eos> I am...<eos> Well, I used to be a horticulturist.<eos> I raise orchids.<eos> That's why it's so warm in here.<eos> They don't need a lot of light.<eos> I wrote to you because I wondered if you'd be kind enough to place one of them on her grave.
- Seen the Dune of Pilat?<eos> - I've never been there.<eos> It's one of the most beautiful sights the ocean on one side, the forest on the other.<eos> Near here, there's a view of the forest that's extraordinary, too.<eos> We can go tomorrow, even if it rains like today.<eos> This is a workout!<eos> Almost there!<eos> My Amazon is covered in fog!<eos> You can't see anything!<eos> Stop shaking the flowers, you'll knock them off.
If I could do this, I could do much more in my life.<eos> So I went there.<eos> The owner said she was glad I was French.<eos> Her clients liked foreigners, accents turned them on.<eos> That night I went back in one of my slightly sexier dresses.<eos> Three other girls were there.<eos> They were about my age.<eos> They worked there full-time.<eos> They were very young but they looked older than me.<eos> Maybe that's why I wanted to act like them.
Why can't I go, too?<eos> You're not old enough.<eos> And it gives you a headache.<eos> It doesn't!<eos> And washed.<eos> I have.<eos> You fibber!<eos> Let's see your hands.<eos> I left them in my room.<eos> If you bring them back to me, I want them to be sparkling clean.
He is handsome!<eos> He's magnificent!<eos> Following these events, the owner of Borely Park came to our house with Aunt Rose.<eos> They'd been on a lovely trip.<eos> The owner amazed us by kissing my mother and then my father.<eos> His tongue rolled "R"s as a stream rolls gravel.<eos> You have to call me Uncle Jules now because I've married Aunt Rose.<eos> My Uncle Jules soon became a great friend of mine.<eos> When I told him he should build a house in his admirable Borely Park he admitted, lightheartedly, that he had never been its owner.<eos> That day I discovered that adults knew how to lie as well as I did and I felt I'd never be safe with them again.
In that case, I'll pick you up at 3:00.<eos> 'You weren't too far off.<eos> They didn't meet in Switzerland. 'They met in Monaco at the Grand Prix.<eos> 'And he wasn't a ski instructor, he was a race car driver.<eos> 'And he didn't have a busted leg, he had an infected tooth.'<eos> I took the liberty of introducing myself to them after you'd left.<eos> Otto and Hanna Munch of Munich.<eos> The bikes are my pride and joy.<eos> Vestiges of my lost youth.<eos> I take them with me everywhere.
Show me!<eos> You should be so lucky!<eos> Your beloved's coming.<eos> Blockhead.<eos> Would you like some beer?<eos> I only like it with honey.<eos> I keep bees. I'll bring you some.<eos> Where are those bees of yours?<eos> In the garden. I watch them fly.<eos> I close my eyes, and fly with them.
We need to concentrate on getting out of here.<eos> Come, or else I won't be able to help you.<eos> This way.<eos> Damn it, the passages are blocked.<eos> There's nothing we can do, the passage is completely filled.<eos> We must go back and find a different way out.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> There is no other exit.<eos> Well, I saw some tunnels we never explored.<eos> Maybe we can find a way through one of them.
Help! Micki!<eos> Close your eyes!<eos> Micki!<eos> Come on.<eos> I think you were very fortunate.<eos> If they'd overwhelmed you, your bodies would have been drained of blood.<eos> Look at this.<eos> That bee's full of blood.<eos> Vampire bees?<eos> That's not the only strange thing about them.
There's fruit juice in the refrigerator.<eos> I don't want fruit juice.<eos> it's gonna be the three of us?<eos> Annie and I are tired.<eos> Gonna be a short night.<eos> Well, I'll have you both in bed by 10, I promise.<eos> Hi. Do I look okay?<eos> -Yeah, you look good.<eos> -Thank you for the flowers.<eos> Don't tell Maddie, but I picked them out of her garden.
Well, it is no good, is it, Chief-Inspector, if I just give you the answer.<eos> Well...<eos> No!<eos> We must give the little grey cells time to do the work.<eos> And give Poirot time to work out who did it and how.<eos> This is not like you, Poirot.<eos> This is not like the grey cells, Hastings!<eos> I've given them every chance!<eos> They have been concentrated.<eos> I have slept to allow them to do their work!
I'll do my best.<eos> But you ought to see my husband.<eos> I feel that I shall be safe in your hands.<eos> Cut! Good.<eos> What is missing by me, is sex appeal!<eos> The woman doctor's wife is drawn irresistibly towards this handsome young fellow.<eos> She knows she will be unfaithful.<eos> It's the way of women.<eos> They cannot help themselves.<eos> They are putty in the hands of the wild demon that lurks in all of them.
- Well done.<eos> - Can you get us out of here?<eos> Sorry, Commander, the first priority was to maintain the shields.<eos> - Acknowledged.<eos> - We'll get to work on it.<eos> Pass my congratulations to your team.<eos> Thanks, Captain.<eos> We're all smiles down here.<eos> Captain, we've been able to verify that these coils are the logs of the Promellian captain.<eos> But most of them have decayed and cannot be repaired.
Captain, we're picking up energy on the planet's surface.<eos> Location?<eos> Two kilometers north of the away team's beam-down point.<eos> Full scan.<eos> - Inconclusive, Captain. - Sir,<eos> I'm sensing a presence on the planet.<eos> - Very vague.<eos> - Life form?<eos> I can't be sure.<eos> The emotions of the crew are so strong now, it's difficult to filter them out.
Quevedo...!<eos> Does it have to be in Latin, father? ...Virgil!<eos> Horace!<eos> But not this padding, I beg!<eos> (the priest keeps praying in Latin) It's very sad to die without growing.<eos> And he started sprouting in XVI century!<eos> It seems that in XVIII century he started dating women effusively!<eos> And that's why he stopped growing.<eos> When I finish growing I will also dedicate myself to women almost all the time.<eos> To sleep with them, I mean.
Now, come on.<eos> Look at me. Come on.<eos> Am I stressed out? Do I have any symptoms of pressure sickness, tremor, slurred speech?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Bud, this is me, Lindsey, O.K.?<eos> You know me better than anybody in the world.<eos> Now watch my lips.<eos> I saw these things.<eos> I touched one of them, and it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build.
There is sufficient evidence to believe that there is a concerted effort to combine these groups under a common umbrella.<eos> And so the FBI is forming a task force to respond to this.<eos> Now, I would like to introduce the agent who has been on this case from beginning to end, Arthur Kressler.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.<eos> There's not much I can add.<eos> I would, however, like to thank the bureau for its unwavering support and commitment to this operation.<eos> And also a big clap on the back to local law enforcement.<eos> They were with us every step of the way.<eos> Without them, we probably wouldn't be here now.
I'm sure practically all of Calcutta is like Whitechapel, Dr. Egglestone.<eos> You think that if conditions were altered, the inhabitants of Whitechapel would be aware that civilization has something better to offer?<eos> - Well, Reverend Fowler thinks so.<eos> - Who is he?<eos> He's the reverend at St. Michael's in Whitechapel.<eos> He's opened the church as a refuge to the women.<eos> Prostitutes in the church?<eos> That's all very admirable, my dear, but they might want to be right back on the streets the moment this ripper's caught.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Let them choose for themselves.
Some wardrobe choices.<eos> Okay, but after dinner, don't put any of your old cheap moves on me.<eos> I have new cheap moves.<eos> Hey, you.<eos> Hey, you.<eos> It looks like you're awake.<eos> Yes, Oscar. You're gonna have the whole place to yourself tonight.<eos> I've got some Laura Antonelli tapes you can watch.<eos> - Did you see some shirts here?<eos> - I put them in the hamper.
Oh, it's awful dark in here!<eos> Went down a treat, all right. Heh, heh!<eos> Hello, Lucille.<eos> You may not remember me. My name is Robert and I'd just like to say that... you're the most pretty girl I've ever met.<eos> I was wondering if you would like to go to the movies tomorrow night.<eos> Those flowers are for you!<eos> Maybe I should give her the flowers first.<eos> Gorblimey!<eos> The poor little blighter's smitten!<eos> Hi, these flowers are for you. They are white roses. I hope you like them.
Tolerate me, please, I beg of you.<eos> It's been such a long time since anyone even tried.<eos> Oh, once, once, the women sighed.<eos> Swelled out their chests...<eos> How beautiful they were!<eos> I thought they'd always be there sighing into my moustache.<eos> Admiring my every glance.<eos> Just waiting for a sign from me.<eos> But they've all gone. They didn't wait.<eos> I suppose I didn't inspire enough love in any of them.
This scene with the Fascist...<eos> Cut it! - We can't modify anything!<eos> - Cut it. It may not even be true. And even if it's true, should we tell these facts or...?<eos> - I'M A FASCIST WORM. SPIT ON ME!<eos> Maybe I summed up some concepts, but the substance...<eos> "The substance"... This expression...<eos> I can't even repeat this expression.<eos> We must remain insensitive, we must be indifferent to today's words.<eos> - If you change these 15 or 20 sentences...<eos> - But you said them!
You misunderstood me!<eos> You weren't listening!<eos> Oh, come on, if I called you up to tell you,<eos> "Hey Dad, I'm the new assistant sub-vice president of pencil sharpening<eos> "at some crappy little company,"<eos> you're telling me you'd think that was great?<eos> I am better than that!<eos> I am not Gil!<eos> Look, I've made some mistakes.<eos> I have to learn from them.
How you doing? Okay.<eos> You think of anybody else yet?<eos> The mailman maybe came by in the afternoon.<eos> There was a cable TV repair guy here, I think.<eos> What's that, Cable Time? Cable Tone?<eos> But he was down in the basement.<eos> Pretty much what I told you yesterday.<eos> What about ladies?<eos> See any young ladies?<eos> See any of them? You told me there was a sex parade.
Scotch rocks.<eos> Barney, do you really perceive me as a major compulsive womanizer?<eos> A 42-year-old shooting star in a galactic harem.<eos> Can I be cured?<eos> Do you wanna be cured?<eos> I know it's ruining my life, and yet...<eos> "And yet." Two words that to one degree or another plague us all.<eos> You see, I truly love women.<eos> - Oh, I see.<eos> - I love everything about them, Barney.
- A small town, you've got to face people.<eos> - There's more to it than that.<eos> Good.<eos> You'll be luckier with women.<eos> Women in big cities outnumber men.<eos> They're more desperate.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If you have opinions, express them.<eos> Don't be shy.<eos> - Just... blurt them out.
Not now, but, if you were alone...<eos> Monsieur de Valmont, you simply don't understand women.<eos> You're right. If a woman wants a little adventure, she doesn't need to be alone. She can manage it perfectly well right under her husband's nose.<eos> Isn't that true, madame?<eos> That's not at all what I meant, madame.<eos> Monsieur de Valmont, I know some women might be weak but believe me, there are women who will always be true.<eos> Nonsense! A true woman is a contradiction in terms.<eos> Not always.<eos> I believe that some women stay true.<eos> I find them fascinating.
That's right.<eos> And we're gonna watch your girls.<eos> The girls.<eos> How am I gonna tell D.J. and Stephanie that their father is going out on a date?<eos> Any ideas?<eos> - Well....<eos> - Tell him, Joseph.<eos> - Trust your instincts.<eos> - Right.<eos> Trust your instincts and tell them exactly what they need to know, but nothing more. - Just tell them that.
Go home and drive safely.<eos> Ask them how they're doing.<eos> For me, sweetums.<eos> That's all I have to do, Peg?<eos> That's it.<eos> Otto, Irwin, how you doing?<eos> We're desolate.<eos> We'll need the triplets.<eos> I'll get them.<eos> I told them to sleep in Kelly's room.
[GRUNTING]<eos> Okay, Peg, this hair dryer is yours, and these cases of bottled water, Marcy, are yours... [THUDDING]<eos> And I believe this hernia is mine.<eos> [SHUTTER CLICKS] It's a beautiful cabin, Steve.<eos> Great job, Mr. Rhoades.<eos> [PEGGY CHUCKLES] Isn't he cute?<eos> Even squid love their young.<eos> What a dump.<eos> Kelly, honey, let me explain something about fishing rods.<eos> When you throw them down, you break them.
I'm saying build me up, don't put me down.<eos> Like... if the opportunity occurs, and it crops up in conversation, you could perhaps mention that I'm very brave.<eos> - Do what? !<eos> - Don't go ape.<eos> Just sort of mention, perhaps, that... I died, and that I was pretty incredibly brave about it.<eos> Perhaps you could mention that I've had tons of girlfriends?<eos> Oh, forget it!<eos> It was just an idea.<eos> You're not wearing those boots?<eos> - What's wrong with them?
Well then why do you torture yourself palying snkes and ladders?<eos> I really do not know.<eos> It is a campulsion.<eos> As a child, I was in a coma for ten days as a result of a snake bite, and ever since I have had a revulsion for them.<eos> And also a terrible lascination.<eos> I am afraid I am a bit of a schizophrenic.<eos> Well you woukd have to be to paly snkes and ladders with yourself.<eos> Look, I would like to help.<eos> That is very sweet of you, but I do not see how you can.<eos> Well, perhaps by making you face your fears. Come to terme with them.
It's not here.<eos> Not on earth.<eos> It wouldn't be, would it?<eos> It's one thing to want to change the way that people live but you want to change how they think, how they feel.<eos> All I'm saying is that change will happen with love, not with killing.<eos> Either way, it's dangerous.<eos> It's against Rome. It's against the way the world is.<eos> And killing or loving, it's all the same.<eos> It simply doesn't matter how you want to change things.<eos> We don't want them changed.
- Three.<eos> Goddamn it, what was the fourth one?<eos> - Drunkenness.<eos> - Drunkenness.<eos> Buddy, Rachel's not for you.<eos> She's not gonna make you happy.<eos> I mean, in Hollywood the women are gonna be tall.<eos> - There's a reason. - They're blonde.<eos> - There's another reason.<eos> Promiscuity is just a religion with them.
Eight years ago, my visions began.<eos> Terrifying fantasies of things to come.<eos> Through them, I found you, Mike.
They look impressed, sir.<eos> I wish we had an elephant.<eos> Would you like something?<eos> Your merchandise, sir.<eos> -You got the diamonds?<eos> -Yes, sir.<eos> We did like you told us.<eos> We tore out the stones and threw that gold junk away.<eos> -Good.<eos> -We hid them in the camera.
Bill, they do. They do.<eos> Granted, I'm married.<eos> I'm a faithful kind of a guy but I've been all over the world.<eos> I get women and women get me.<eos> That is pathetic.<eos> I'm trying to help you.<eos> Take New York women, for instance.<eos> Much too tough. Much too pushy.<eos> Too hard for you.<eos> You're way too sweet for them.
We've seen these everywhere. The events are too remote now.<eos> It's over.<eos> But there, nothing is over.<eos> Everybody still demands that the Russians leave.<eos> There are strikes all over the country, and protests.<eos> But here, nobody seems to care anymore.<eos> Here is the story about the nudists in France.<eos> Wait, just have a look.<eos> Superb photographs of Prague.<eos> It's a pity we're just getting them now.
Me and the little leech are gonna try to get some sleep.<eos> I couldn't find Michelle's teething ring, so I got the next best thing:<eos> An ice-cold carrot.<eos> What? I could've brought the fish sticks, but you would've thought I was an idiot.<eos> Look, Jesse I want you to know it was nice of you to take the rap for D.J. and Stephanie.<eos> And I'm real sorry I got so crazy before walking around you going, "Well, well, well."<eos> It's cool, cool, cool.<eos> The girls just mean so much to me.<eos> Especially now, you know, since Pam's gone.<eos> I know what you're saying, man. I worry about them too.
There's a miracle of Christmas and there's Smokey Robinson and The Miracles, there's Miracle Whip.<eos> But there's no miracle of Thanksgiving, huh.<eos> Oh, no?<eos> Suppose the Pilgrims had landed in Florida.<eos> We'd all be eating flamingo.<eos> All I know is, everything today has to be absolutely perfect.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it's the girls' first Thanksgiving without their mother.<eos> That's right.<eos> That's gotta be rough on them.

You ain't gonna do here what you did in them other prisons.<eos> You got that?<eos> Look around you, man.<eos> This joint belongs to me. You ain't taking over, you see?<eos> -That's right, you tell him.<eos> -Did a nice job with it too.<eos> Yeah, that's right, man.<eos> And I wanna see what kind of job you can do.<eos> On my shoes.<eos> You're gonna shine them.
Well, it did move us next door to each other.<eos> All right, two tricks, but I'm talking about the one that keeps us men from ruling the Earth.<eos> See, nature gave men the urge and women the answer.<eos> Sure, it's not much, but it's all they need.<eos> Gee, I wish nature gave us everything, like the worm... or like that guy who works down at the antique store, but...nobody asked me, and now it's too late.<eos> God, that was a wet t-shirt.<eos> Steve, think dry here for a minute, will you?<eos> See, the problem is... women know we have these urges, but they have the same urges we do.<eos> They just don't show it because... Well, that's how spiteful they are.<eos> But, Steve, they need us just as much as we need them.
Dear Helene:<eos> Your Ellery Queen scripts sound rather fun.<eos> I wish we could see them on our TV over here.<eos> It wants livening up a bit.<eos> Our TV, I mean, not your script.<eos> We're all thrilled that you'll be coming to London.<eos> Do let us know when, so we can make the necessary arrangements.<eos> Dear Helene:<eos> I am enclosing a few snaps.<eos> Frank says none of them do him justice, he is much better looking but we just let him dream.
The two sisters had a French servant.<eos> Her name was Babette.<eos> This may seem strange for two puritan ladies, living in such a remote, desolate place, and it deserves an explanation.<eos> Babette's presence in the house of the two sisters can be explained only through the hidden regions of the heart.<eos> As young girls, the beauty of Martine and Filippa had been extraordinary, akin to flowering fruit trees.<eos> They were never to be seen at balls or parties.<eos> The young men went to church in the hope of seeing them.<eos> In the pastor's flock, earthly love and marriage were considered to be of scant worth and merely empty illusion.<eos> In this calling of mine, my two daughters are my right hand and my left.<eos> Would you rob me of them?
You come from the streets and suddenly you're up here.<eos> Women are throwing themselves at you and they smell so good.<eos> They really take care of themselves.<eos> I never knew women could be like that.<eos> They're so goddamn rich you think they must know about everything.<eos> They're slippin' their room keys in my hand two and three times a day-- different women-- so, I think I'm scoring' big, right?<eos> You think, ""They wouldn't be doing this if they didn't care about me, right?""<eos> That's all right.<eos> I understand.<eos> You were just using them, that's all.
- Quiet. He's here.<eos> There's a concert Thursday with Rocky Walters and his Rolling Stones.<eos> I wouldn't miss it.<eos> - Did you see him?<eos> - It's him, no doubt.<eos> We'll follow him to his room.<eos> Dear father, I'll follow your way right to the end.<eos> I'll take my revenge on those bastards who killed you.<eos> With the help of my women recruited these two years to collect an immense fortune.<eos> With them we'll defeat those bastards.
Write to me, I miss you so much.<eos> OK, I'll write to you now.<eos> Pablo... I love you.<eos> Pablo, are you there?<eos> - Pick up the phone, I'm sick of this.<eos> - Yes, I'm here.<eos> I've been calling for days.<eos> I've been out.<eos> Did you get my letters?<eos> Yes, and I don't like them.
You got any ice?<eos> Go fetch me two chunks about this big and a piece of rag.<eos> You a doctor?<eos> - No, but I seen my share of broken noses.<eos> Now just put it up in the air, buddy, just like your watching the clouds.<eos> We'll get that bleeding stopped.<eos> I ga my liggid... Say what?<eos> - He said he got his licks in.<eos> Seems to be all the men around here care about, wives and kids are starving, so long as they've got their licks in...<eos> It's just frustration, is all when you can't take care of them you care about.
You have to run away on your own, Pelle.<eos> I'm too old. I can't do it.<eos> I'm too old to travel.<eos> I'm done up.<eos> I've become too old.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> We'll make a bag for you, Pelle.<eos> You can have two of my shirts. You've got the clean one on.<eos> Remember not to wear them more than a fortnight at a time or you'll get a bad reputation.<eos> Change socks before you get holes in them.
- Right, sweetheart?<eos> - Miss?<eos> You didn't put it in your purse again, did you?<eos> Last vacation she put my credit cards in there, and we couldn't find them.<eos> - Here. Could you hold this, please?<eos> - You want to move it up there?<eos> We got a plane to catch.<eos> Go on!<eos> Go on!<eos> You can't live with them... - and you can't live without them. - This is ridiculous!
See oneself!<eos> Who hasn't dreamed of such a vision?<eos> So perfect an image... Not like in a mirror!<eos> Every thought's there, from start to finish!<eos> Your conscience is trained to examine itself, but it can never achieve such insight!<eos> You can grasp only one thought at a time.<eos> Man never fully knows what's going on in himself.<eos> You see yourself in enigmas, not clearly!<eos> Look!<eos> All your thoughts are here, in detail... the endless web that links them...
But I must say that I thought they went a little overboard in the love scenes.<eos> I-I think sex should be a private thing.<eos> Don't you?<eos> [Applause] Well, obviously the audience applauds when they hear something funny.<eos> Well, I? I guess they can get all that other stuff at home, can't they?<eos> Anyway, we will, uh, be back with Jordan Manmouth shortly, after a brief message or two, so stay with us.<eos> [Driver] A very good show, Mr. Manmouth.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Don't those creepy stories ever scare you?<eos> No, I'm not scared by them.
Paris is a great city.<eos> You can buy anything here.<eos> I got this transmitter in a little shop in the Latin Quarter. I found this circuit board in the Champs d'Elysee. A little shop on the Left Bank carries these batteries.<eos> All harmless.<eos> would you set a chair up over there where we can all see it?<eos> Indulge me, gentlemen.<eos> I'm going to give you a little demonstration.<eos> Unrelated items, and each one innocuous in itself.<eos> That's how bureaucrats tend to view component parts, even when they are combined to create something substantial.<eos> Now, then, harmless little pieces, but you put them all together, and there's a certain je ne sais quoi.
Did you say "we"?<eos> You've got balls.<eos> I do the work, you take the credit.<eos> You know what your problem is?<eos> Your face.<eos> Come on, you're too good-looking.<eos> Girls go out with you and get nervous.<eos> They feel dumpy, they don't want to compete.<eos> They want a guy like ... like me.<eos> A guy who'll make them look good.
Go!<eos> Check out 11:00.<eos> He's going to fall!<eos> Stay the hell away from there!<eos> Ready those winches!<eos> Hit the deck!<eos> Hold your fire!<eos> Get down, damn it! We can't just blow away an opportunity like this.<eos> Look at these creatures.<eos> We don't know much about them, or why they're here.
His symptoms are very...<eos> You're being unwise, sir.<eos> Lie down, Pierre.<eos> I don't like it in there.<eos> People die in bedrooms.<eos> Where's Romaine?<eos> Looking for the drops.<eos> Hope she hurries. I'm late for an appointment.<eos> Call her, Christiane.<eos> These headaches... you get them 4 times a day, you said?
You remember that.<eos> Continental Coach Lines number 28 arriving ramp 16.<eos> Ventura, Santa Paula, and Oxnard.<eos> Attention, please.<eos> The Sunliner Express to San Diego departs in 30 minutes from ramp five.<eos> Mr Cameron?<eos> Howdy.<eos> - Where are the addresses?<eos> - Right here.<eos> Had a little trouble with one of them.
And you, sir?<eos> - Make that two.<eos> How does a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?<eos> - Just lucky, I guess.<eos> - You're upset about losing the whales.<eos> You're very perceptive.<eos> - How will that be done, exactly?<eos> - They'll be flown to Alaska. - They'll be released there.<eos> - That's the last you'll see of them?<eos> See, yes. But we'll tag them with special transmitters and monitor them.
Tell me something. The whale's transmitter, what's the frequency?<eos> Sorry, that's classified.<eos> Look, I don't have a clue who you are.<eos> You wouldn't want to show me around your spaceship, would you?<eos> - That wouldn't be my first choice.<eos> - Well, there we are.<eos> I am here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd century.<eos> I can go to the open sea to get them.<eos> I'd rather have yours.<eos> It's better for me. It's better for you. It's better for them.
Say, Grandmother...<eos> Back when you were the head diver...<eos> Didn't Dad have a kid by one of the diver girls?<eos> No!<eos> I don't know anything about that.<eos> I just have a feeling that he did...<eos> Sa-ohan!<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> I don't want anything to do with you.<eos> I've heard you're buttering up young kids... selling them on these land purchases.
He's only smiling to congratulate you, Anne.<eos> I think he was trying to rub it in.<eos> I'll take the shortcut through the pasture, Anne.<eos> Don't be afraid of the bullies, Diana. We'll be completely civilized and take the road.<eos> I have no intention of arriving out of breath for our examination.<eos> Charlie Sloan, you meansly little bully, you ought to be horse-whipped!<eos> This will be the last time I catch you little trouble makers in my pasture. These fields are not a free-for-all!<eos> You frighten my cattle to death and they won't be milked.<eos> I've never even set a toenail in your pasture before, Mr. Sadler.<eos> I was really attempting to avenge my bosom friend, Diana, for being tortured. Your cattle are such mournful-looking creatures,... you can't know how utterly wretched I feel to have you think I'd frighten them.
There, there, there now, excellent.<eos> Are you quite comfortable? Yes, thank you.<eos> How long do you wish me to remain here, sir?<eos> Oh, an hour, perhaps, perhaps longer.<eos> An hour?<eos> Oh, but not, I assure you, an hour of tedium.<eos> Let us see how we can best entertain and divert you.<eos> Do you enjoy funny stories, Miss Hunter?<eos> Why, yes.<eos> Well, then, I shall tell you some, and all of them, I assure you, absolutely true.
Sister Catherine!<eos> Have you met the rice inspector?<eos> The rice inspector sent by the archdiocese to inspect the rice, which is what they do.<eos> Ah, yes, very good.<eos> Sam, what is it?<eos> Tell me what you have to say and then leave, please.<eos> Listen, I want you to come back to Cheers.<eos> I don't think you belong here, Diane.<eos> No, Sam, I do belong here.<eos> Although I'm not of their order, the sisters took me in, and working here among them has helped me find the peace that had so eluded me.
They're too aggressive.<eos> They take up the best beaches in summer.<eos> They can't cook worth a damn.<eos> I say anyone makes such great cars can't be all bad.<eos> I would say your intuition worked out very well... for Monsieur Frank, Mademoiselle.<eos> Worked out for both of us.<eos> My intuition says this is probably... a good time for me to go file my report.<eos> Where's the rest of my car?<eos> Oh, yes, I almost forgot.<eos> It was blown to pieces at a rest stop.
Luckily he hasn't said anything!<eos> She's leaving for Europe and she didn't even kiss me!<eos> Vita, are you jealous?<eos> There's no place for dreams and jealousy here.<eos> Accept things as they are.<eos> When things are bad, you have to change them!<eos> There's too much noise!<eos> The priest isn't here.<eos> - And the rehearsal?<eos> - It's cancelled.
It was chaos.<eos> There were just hundreds of people moving, and one reason we had to get off the beach was there were people behind us one after the other, group after group.<eos> [Russell] Boats from the prior landing turned upside down.<eos> There were bodies floating out into the water.<eos> [Merrill] I had never seen a dead person, even at a funeral, and as I hit the beach, I saw bodies and body parts all over the beach.<eos> We started to go up on the sand, we'd go up two feet and fall back one.<eos> We were just laying on the beach, and there were bodies all over.<eos> [Braun] Guys were dying.<eos> Everywhere you looked, somebody was dying.<eos> [Merrill] Wanted to cross the beach quickly, because it was being raked with 88's, machine guns, and there was a lot of sniper fire as well.
The town was in ruins.<eos> And at that point... the Japanese military just had to give up.<eos> We can't do anything against atomic bombs.<eos> We can meet Marines at the beaches, we've got an air force left that can go out there with the Kamikazes and sink a lot of American ships.<eos> We can force them to pay a high price if they want to invade Japan.<eos> But what were they gonna do about an atomic bomb?<eos> Many people have debated the use of that bomb over the years, but I'd say that it was probably the best decision ever made because we would've lost many men.<eos> Over a million probably would've been lost in trying to invade Japan.<eos> The atomic bomb surely made the war end quicker.<eos> But I think the Japanese would have surrendered without it.
- Holy smoke.<eos> So what did he do that scared people?<eos> Why don't you ask Mac? It's his granddaddy.<eos> - I don't remember.<eos> - Was he some kind of axe murderer?<eos> Why don't you ask him yourself?<eos> He's sitting right behind you, on the mantel.<eos> My daddy... was a man of vision.<eos> People always fear what they don't understand.<eos> He lived for this land... and he died for it.
- You bet, Gene.<eos> Bring that girl.<eos> Damn, that's good!<eos> Carl?<eos> - Hey. So, do you wanna tell me what's with all the cloak-and-dagger shit?<eos> There's something weird going on here, Suzie.<eos> - No kidding.<eos> - I'm serious.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I had a good look at that injector pump and it's clearly been messed with.
Regarding this of course.<eos> Somebody has dug up my father's body and has stolen it.<eos> What's more, they've made absolutely sure we'd know they've done it.<eos> You wouldn't believe the strange things we see in this job!<eos> Probably the work of a bunch of kids. Listen to heavy metal backwards and...<eos> Children?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Sorry, I must be going.<eos> I'll keep you informed of whatever we find out.<eos> Shit! Boys, this cup isn't a clue. I've just left it here myself.
No, I'm very busy.<eos> I do a lot of other community service.<eos> That's good. You just got yourself elected parent rep.<eos> And, Charlie, we'll talk about the suspension.<eos> Curtis, what is he doing in the naughty-and-nice center?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - I'm checking the naughty-nice list.<eos> - I'm checking it twice.<eos> - I already told you!<eos> It's been checked. Don't worry.
No one came by.<eos> The radio should still be here.<eos> - Makan, is it your beautiful radio?<eos> - Yes. Don't worry. I'll find it.<eos> Makan...<eos> Let's have tea.<eos> The radio isn't lost. It's buried.
Excuse me, sir, I'm sure that you're right, but how do you know all of that?<eos> - I mean, about the computer...<eos> - It's patently obvious, isn't it?<eos> There are no prints on the keyboard, not even hers. Why?<eos> He used it.<eos> He wiped them clean.<eos> Right. And you said that he was tall.<eos> The victim's short, maybe 5'4".<eos> Look at the chair.<eos> It's lowered almost all the way.
Why do I drink, son?<eos> Because life's become boring<eos> I lived until I was about forty and that was it<eos> Everywhere you look is Misery<eos> There is no love, Vanya<eos> It's good that you were at war<eos> War makes a man of you<eos> And that's what you should be<eos> A man has strength It's all held together by that strength<eos> I had strength but it's gone
I'II see you soon. And so shall someone else.<eos> God bless you.<eos> Again. "What ho!<eos> apothecary!"<eos> It's no use.<eos> I can't remember it.<eos> Smike, you can only fail by not trying.<eos> "Who calls so loud?"<eos> It is a crime that Mr. C has not found a spot for my Highland fling.<eos> Romeo and Juliet will not be the same without it.
A bright flame, it's hot...<eos> It may be a dream.<eos> I've started having them again.<eos> - That's a good sign.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> The thought of a grave with no name...<eos> Shall we sit on the couch and listen to some music?<eos> The spring of God Is never dry<eos> You can drink and slake your thirst<eos> It's filled with The Water of Life
- That's a good sign.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> The thought of a grave with no name...<eos> Shall we sit on the couch and listen to some music?<eos> The spring of God Is never dry<eos> You can drink and slake your thirst<eos> It's filled with The Water of Life<eos> Always cool, clear and bright<eos> My spring of Life never seems to dry<eos> It's never touched by the droughts of Time
During the day, we helped him plant agaves... placed real upright... then covered with earth.<eos> He was very methodical.<eos> Just like when you make a film, it takes up a lot of time.<eos> That 's how he did things.<eos> Studying carefully their outcome.<eos> At night, he'd check them.<eos> HOUSEKEEPER They'd bend in a week.<eos> He uprooted them and replant them like... the week before and it took over 3 or 4 days.<eos> Studying the deeds and the history of the house...<eos> I learned it had been built in the 17th Century... and had housed the pirate Juan Lorenzo.
Before one of us die.<eos> Go.<eos> Go.<eos> Be careful!<eos> This doll is really pretty.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You think so, too?<eos> Yeah, but it'll get dirty easily, since it's white.<eos> I'll just be careful.<eos> Anyway, know what it's called?
It's no great thing.<eos> Here is the chapel.<eos> The bishop wanted us to start a seminary for Bible and pastoral studies with the priests in the diocese.<eos> But it didn't work out.<eos> Some of us still meet every month.<eos> The bathroom is there, and your room at the end.<eos> Sanjuanera does the cleaning.<eos> I eat lunch and dinner at her place.<eos> You'll have to do the same.<eos> It hasn't been occupied for some time.
Vámonos, amigo!<eos> Hasta luego!<eos> Man: What were you doing down there?<eos> Getting some dinner.<eos> That's a high-powered communications cable!<eos> It's not something to screw around with!<eos> I don't think it's me you've got to worry about.<eos> Man: What's that?<eos> A shark's tooth.<eos> I pried it from the underwater cable.
Lot of hardware.<eos> It's better here than in a scrap heap.<eos> Does it work?<eos> It'll blow a hole clear through the hull of a battleship.<eos> - What about a shark?<eos> - Abso-fuckin-lutely.<eos> Okay, so the torpedo's hooked up and armed.<eos> Are we ready?<eos> The Mark 44 torpedo launch system's nominal, but-- there's a wrinkle.<eos> It wasn't designed for a biological target.
- Piña colada.<eos> - Piña!<eos> Fuck!<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> More like seven and a half hours for me, fuck, I forgot my bathing suit! - Unbelievable!<eos> - Screw you!<eos> I bet you packed eight times so you didn't forget anything.<eos> A bathing suit and beach towel, they top the list.<eos> Fuck, my towel!<eos> The thick one, I can see it on the counter.
- What?<eos> Those from yesterday.<eos> What is this?<eos> I spent a lot of time and money.<eos> Do you have any idea how much each one cost?<eos> I invested a lot, too.<eos> Check your bike. It won't start.<eos> They were expensive.<eos> It worked fine a moment ago.<eos> It must be used to your feet.
- Where's your mom?<eos> - She went shoppin'.<eos> She'll be gone for a couple hours, though.<eos> That woman always could shop.<eos> Say, fool, cut that noise down.<eos> Asshole!<eos> - How you been doing, son?<eos> - I'm cool as a fan.<eos> - How's your car?<eos> - Still got a dent in it.
I'd love to.<eos> I see ya, beige boy.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, this is Tooth on KNUT, 68.9.<eos> I am so tired right now, I'm drooling on myself.<eos> I have been here since 9:00 in the morning getting prepared for this day.<eos> I can't find anybody to replace me. I'm playing songs.<eos> People been calling me about this money.<eos> It's about time for me to sign up outta here.<eos> What I'm gonna do right now is go to this block party I heard about.<eos> It's supposed to be off the hook.
Well anyway since my treatment is longer than school probation<eos> I don't know whether this is punishment or a vacation.<eos> How can we burn the gym and just get probation?<eos> Just get probation?<eos> My mom put air conditioners in every classroom.<eos> Asshole we should've been let off.<eos> There he goes again.<eos> Anyway, if you don't tell me I'll rip your throat again!<eos> Sung-hwan, about your car.<eos> What about it?
The aim is to build a nation"<eos> A nation which guarantees equal rights to all in society<eos> A society that doesn't discriminate on grounds of religion<eos> A nation that does not tolerate the exploitation of man by man<eos> "Too idealistic, Bhagat"<eos> "very difficult.<eos> - Difficult, Fani-da.<eos> Not impossible"<eos> It isn't easy to keep united a country that has so many... "religions, castes, cultures, languages"<eos> "Unless we understand this task now unless we struggle for it now..." "India will still get freedom. But, it will degenerate..."
I don't think she's gonna be using it since you got her kicked out of school.<eos> Okay, well, just let me know if you change your mind.<eos> All right, butts in the seats.<eos> Six molecules of water... plus six molecules of carbon dioxide... produces one molecule of sugar and six molecules of oxygen.<eos> What am I talking about?<eos> Photosynthesis.<eos> - Good.<eos> Photosynthesis. - What?<eos> What?<eos> It's carried out by many different organisms... ranging from plants to bacteria.
This location does not match the record<eos> Ah, there's another 200m from the scene<eos> - Set up a net<eos> - Yes, sir<eos> 427. this is 746 Intercept area 11 to 22<eos> Check point E to R<eos> Stop, stop<eos> What?<eos> You see that car?<eos> It's stolen
Why are you going round barefoot?<eos> I'm not like the other oldies. My feet are always boiling hot.<eos> Put your socks on before they arrive.<eos> Put them on before they arrive!<eos> She can't hear you.<eos> She hears what she wants.<eos> Kristin was never happy in this house.<eos> Only natural, it's not hers.<eos> Why isn't it her house?<eos> It was built for her sister.
I'll need a guitar case.<eos> As you can see, the streets in this part of the city are very narrow and old.<eos> It will not be easy to escape.<eos> Sergeant Beckett's rifle was our one priority.<eos> That's the best we have with our limitations.<eos> No, it'll do just fine.<eos> I must leave to make sure everything is arranged.<eos> The city will be in chaos.<eos> You need to get to the church.<eos> It's built on top of Roman catacombs.
No!<eos> Men. protect Haru<eos> Yes. sir<eos> All forward!<eos> Get that culprit!<eos> Your Majesty!<eos> Leave my father to me<eos> Everybody, please run<eos> But the tower has fallen<eos> It' s still connected to the other side
Be held right.<eos> Immediately!<eos> Do not move.<eos> Shit.<eos> I still missed.<eos> Idiot!<eos> You are really idiot.<eos> Me, Ann Batory, carrying in me an unhappy destiny.<eos> I came in this city thinking of having a peaceful life.<eos> But it is submerged by the darkness.
- Will they really come to measure?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - So?<eos> You move soon?<eos> - It depends on what they give us.<eos> The new houses are smaller.<eos> Lowercase.<eos> Riquiqui.<eos> And his house?<eos> It only 28 square meters.
I did my job.<eos> I told you every detail.<eos> If it isn't because of you, why did it turn out this way.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> She was my daughter. How could I sit still?<eos> Why do you blame it all on me?<eos> Chief, our scouts report they've found a new town.<eos> It's full of oil, food, and human resources.<eos> 180 kilometers from here.<eos> It is called "Bad Man's Town".

I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life.<eos> This is our night.<eos> Once you're in the White House, everything defers to the office.<eos> It's what you need to do the job.<eos> If it's your marriage that helps you, that's great.<eos> But if not, that's OK too.<eos> You can have whatever you want, David.<eos> We gotta get outta here. Which way?<eos> I'm in an underground detention facility.<eos> It's being used as a prison to house Drazen.
Jack, I don't want this to get back to The Alliance.<eos> They can't know that I'm taking measures.<eos> - I understand.<eos> - Good.<eos> I'll send Dixon.<eos> Jack, there's something else.<eos> After Sark recovered Rambaldi's music box, we tracked him to a safe house in the Falkland Islands.<eos> Sent in a team.<eos> And did we retrieve it?<eos> Yes. It was destroyed with age, as Sydney said.
In regard to the 86 counts of espionage leading to the deaths of 12 United States operatives,<eos> Derevko has pled guilty on all counts.<eos> A select penalty jury was impaneled early this morning. And the decision was predictably swift.<eos> Derevko received the maximum sentence under federal statute.<eos> Death by lethal injection.<eos> Since she's opted to forgo all appeals, her execution will be carried out three days from today.<eos> Session adjourned.<eos> Confidential to Deputy Director Devlin.<eos> I'm writing to inform you that my father, Jack Bristow, did willfully deceive the CIA into believing Irina Derevko violated her immunity agreement.<eos> I'm committing this statement to paper so it may be used in an official capacity to halt my mother's execution.
Those are official code names given by the CIA to over a dozen of our officers, all of whom were killed.<eos> - What?<eos> - 25 years ago.<eos> Killed by an unknown foreign agent. Who the CIA suspected was KGB.<eos> Your suspicions about your father having once worked for the KGB, they're accurate.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> He was tracked by counterintelligence.<eos> - That was routine.<eos> - Nothing's routine about that list.<eos> There's something very specific about it.
You seen my cuff links, Uncle Rory?<eos> Metal deals, hold my sleeves together?<eos> You don't want those.<eos> What you really want is Velcro.<eos> - Did I ever tell you how that was my idea?<eos> - 'Scuse me. How you doin'?<eos> Good.<eos> Rory? What you doin' there?<eos> I'm tryin' to make myself an Irish coffee, but this stupid thing is on the fritz.<eos> Watch it, it's still plugged in.
The school being rebuilt?<eos> It means something.<eos> As in what?<eos> Can I borrow a pencil?<eos> Thanks a lot.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> There was a bee. it flew in my eye.<eos> I'm very allergic.<eos> I think it's gone.
Warrick, ease up.<eos> My fault.<eos> Use your radio and call for backup.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah. I'm all right.<eos> I'm evidence.<eos> I got some fibers here.<eos> Possibly secondary.<eos> This rope was identical to the rope around the victim's neck.<eos> It was used as a handrail.
most likely sexual.<eos> Two gunshot wounds, left temple.<eos> One shot was a through-and-through.<eos> Trace ASAP, along with the plastic.<eos> My preliminary probe shows water in the lungs, which indicates she was still alive when<eos> Looks like the eyes are glued shut.<eos> Gold crusty substance underneath.<eos> What is that, Mina?<eos> The substance is water- soluble.<eos> But somehow it got preserved in the water.
And what looks like a... size 12, possibly from the pool.<eos> There were definitely two guys here, Griss.<eos> Now we just need to figure out if one of them was Mr. Newman.<eos> Hey, fellas.<eos> Looks like the husband pulled a Clark Kent and left all his clothes behind.<eos> Couldn't have gone far. I got his wallet, credit card and keys.<eos> You hear that? What is that?<eos> Oh, yeah, it's the pool.<eos> It's been doing it all night.<eos> Sounds like it's clogged.
I got it.<eos> You did? I got it.<eos> I found it.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Hot frame, all right.<eos> I still can't see who it is.<eos> You can see a little more of the room, though.<eos> There's a small table and a lamp in the left corner.<eos> Good eye, Sara.<eos> Yeah, that kitsch lamp. Somebody moved it out to the lobby.
I'll allow it.<eos> For the record, are you addicted to gambling?<eos> Damn!<eos> Why didn't I see that coming?<eos> Gambling?<eos> It's legal;<eos> don't worry about it.<eos> Legal doesn't matter in there.<eos> You know the judge is going to throw out our blood evidence, right?<eos> Truth is, it is compromised, Warrick.
Take a look Yeah, sure<eos> Be warned, he's a ... a little bloated<eos> Oh, my god<eos> What's the matter, Larry? You don't recognize him? Uh-uh<eos> Mind if I take this, Larry?<eos> No, you can't take my hula girl<eos> That's all right<eos> We'll come back with a warrant Knock yourself out<eos> See you later, Larry<eos> Who removes a hula girl from their car right before it's stolen?
Professor Metzger ... killed Fisher? His artifacts were under lock and key<eos> So he was the only one who had access<eos> Ginny, the professor had a very serious interest<eos> The professor was a genius, okay?<eos> And he taught us ...<eos> About hatred.<eos> Right?<eos> It's more than that<eos> The professor proved to us that violence is natural<eos> Without it humanity would become ... unbalanced
She's right.<eos> I underestimated you.<eos> They always come back to me with empty hearts, begging me to end their lives.<eos> But you you almost found love.<eos> I did find love.<eos> Maybe he did love you.<eos> But I'm afraid that's over, my dear child, now that he knows what you are.<eos> It's time to embrace your fate.<eos> The pain you're feeling won't go away.<eos> As an immortal creature, can you bear to live with it for eternity?
- Speak quickly.<eos> I can help you destroy the power of three with one simple move.<eos> I can make you the next Source.<eos> It's another trick.<eos> If it were, why would I have risked my life to come here?<eos> One of the witches has cast a spell, brought her past self into the present.<eos> She's a powerless child vulnerable to attack.<eos> - So?<eos> - So kill the child and the present witch is no more.<eos> The entire line is extinguished, and with it, the Charmed Ones.
- Freak you!<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Under the circumstances...<eos> Mindy Reiser's been snubbing me all night.<eos> - She has?<eos> - She won't even look at me.<eos> - Because of the Martin Short thing?<eos> - Yeah. I turned it around, and then I do it again.<eos> I think we have one song left that was specially requested.<eos> It's called "You Oughta Know."
-...of a toilet brush?<eos> -Yes. lt's the little brush you're using to clean the toilet.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, I deserved that.<eos> That's fine. That favour I was asking for, it's not a favour so much.<eos> It's really-- lt's like a proposition, which, I think you'll agree with me...<eos> -...is a far more enticing word. -Spare me the sales pitch and get on with it.<eos> I have band practice in an hour.<eos> Well, to outfit yourself for said proposition which you'll hear the dazzling details of, you'll need a new dress and I am willing to take you to a house of high fashion and buy you said new dress, which will become your favourite dress.<eos> It will become your head-turning dress, and it will only be complete when it is filled out, by you, tomorrow night at my office party.
This is not an ideal time.<eos> I wanted to say good-bye.<eos> You may find this disturbing.<eos> I've seen a body before. 15 of them on that alien ship.<eos> It's different when it's someone you know personally.<eos> I was hoping it was another one of his practical jokes.<eos> Travis called me down to Decon a few weeks ago.<eos> He said that he brought some kind of gelatinous life-form aboard.<eos> He said it might be sentient.<eos> That the Captain needed me to figure out how to communicate with it.
Its surface is pockmarked.i<eos> Probably micrometeorite impacts.t<eos> Seems to have been in orbit for some time.u<eos> The spikes are magnetic.n<eos> Two of them have locked onto the hull.<eos> Stand by.<eos> I'm going to run an internal scan.'<eos> There are proximity sensors...<eos> but they appear to be off-line.<eos> It looks like the mine doesn't think it's hit anything.n
-...we had no idea-- -l know who Mom was.<eos> -Need a credit card for groceries. -You want this?<eos> -Because Art´s is fine. lt´d be much easier.<eos> -Delia wants it to be like Mom´s.<eos> Okay. Well, if you´re gonna cook, I´ll help you.<eos> I got it.<eos> -You don´t have to do this, Ephram.<eos> -Yes, I do.<eos> For Delia.<eos> Lord God, bless this grave and send your angels to watch over it.
By having them sit in the front I can monitor their behavior more closely.<eos> You believe girls are genetically less rowdy so you relegate them to the back?<eos> - The term "relegate" is...<eos> - Entirely appropriate.<eos> As for Delia having a mind of her own whose mind is she supposed to have?<eos> - I think you misunderstood my point.<eos> - No I don't think that I did.<eos> Delia perhaps you should step outside while your father and I...<eos> No no. She was here for the bad part. I want her to hear what I'm about to say.<eos> My daughter has been through a traumatic year and come through it remarkably well.
Previously on Farscape...<eos> Scarran warriors outnumber Peacekeeper soldiers ten to one.<eos> But if and when they attack we will lose, Braca.<eos> Unless we harness a superior weapon.<eos> Yes.<eos> Wormhole technology.<eos> Without it...
- But now Pilot knows what?<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Ask him.<eos> I must follow Vella.<eos> Hey!<eos> I need to know about what...<eos> How old are you?<eos> How old?<eos> I am 293 cycles.<eos> Anytime there is goodness, it will be destroyed by... by a cause.
- Look, Grayza doesn't give a rats ass...<eos> - I saw you with her!<eos> Grayza... doesn't give a damn... about probes!<eos> - She just wants what's in my head!<eos> - Vella was my friend, I'll not let you take what she discovered!<eos> You not give it to them!<eos> Get off me, you son of a bitch!<eos> I'm not gonna tell anybody I saw where the probe is!<eos> - You saw it?<eos> - It's buried...
- So, like... just over half a metra.<eos> - That's it.<eos> Let's go find the third probe.<eos> I was wrong...<eos> It was you, not Vella<eos> You want the probes as a weapon.<eos> Where did Crichton... see the probe?<eos> I don't know, I don't know exactly.<eos> He told me he saw it.<eos> He said it was buried.
I'll see to it you never work again.<eos> Actually, that's not how it works.<eos> You see, you've earned yourself a black mark in the client registry.<eos> No Companion is going to contract with you ever again.<eos> You'll have to rely on your winning personality to get women.<eos> God help you.<eos> You didn't have to wound that man.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> It was just funny.<eos> You willing to fight that hard to protect my property... I'll have it in your hold before midnight.
No one insults the turtles!<eos> Come on, you!<eos> Let the games begin.<eos> Everyone listen!<eos> Damn!<eos> I've devised a way to save you and stop global warming at the same time.<eos> Granted, you're all blasting out greenhouse gases.<eos> You're one to talk.<eos> But we can use those very gases to save the planet.<eos> If you all vent your exhausts directly upward in one burst... It should thrust the Earth further from the sun, thus cooling it.
They discovered an intact 20th-Century pizzeria, like the one I used to work at!<eos> Interesting.<eos> No, wait, the other thing. Tedious.<eos> Let's check it out. You can see how I lived before I met you.<eos> You lived before you met me? Sure.<eos> Lots of people did.<eos> Really.<eos> Truly, they were as gods who built this place.<eos> Next, we come to the splendidly preserved wooden pizza paddle.<eos> Scientists theorize it was used to gently discipline the delivery boy.
Then you drove it past a certified mechanic?<eos> Dad, stop it.<eos> This is a nice thing Dean did here.<eos> - Remember, nice things?<eos> - I'm sorry, she can't accept it.<eos> Now, if you will excuse us, we were about to order dinner.<eos> I understand you want Rory to be safe, but so do I.<eos> I wouldn't give this car to her if I didn't know for a fact... that it was 100% safe.<eos> I checked it, my father checked it, and Gypsy at Hewes Brothers checked it.<eos> It has been checked.
-His ring went out.<eos> He's stranded back there.<eos> You're a strange one, Steve Trevor.<eos> You have no special powers, yet you're willing to risk your life.<eos> Some things are worth dying for, angel.<eos> There's an enemy airfield around here somewhere.<eos> And our job is to turn it into Swiss cheese.<eos> Welcome to Easy Company, soldier.<eos> Some kind of factory complex.<eos> It's defended by anti-aircraft batteries.
Just do your damn job.<eos> There's no need for that kind of language.<eos> You prefer some other language?<eos> How about "kickbacks"?<eos> If you don't clean it up, Mancuso, I'll bring in people who will.<eos> There's nobody, Mandy.<eos> I swear.<eos> Do I look like a stupid person?<eos> I found your personal ad on a web site.<eos> You've had it there at least a month.
And that's all the proof I'll need.<eos> You couldn't stand it.<eos> The board of directors gave your job to Dr. Gould.<eos> - You killed him. - Dr. Gould.<eos> You stole some drugs to make it look like a patient did it.<eos> You needed a fall guy.<eos> LaFrankie fit the bill.<eos> You probably got LaFrankie all doped up, then lured him into the woods where the cops found him the next day.<eos> You only had one problem... the murder weapon.<eos> It was registered in your name.
I prefer to take care of business first.<eos> Bet that's not the first time you've said that.<eos> Bite me. Give me that.<eos> Whoa, look at these prints.<eos> This was a big guy.<eos> Yes, he was a really big guy.<eos> Parked nearby, maybe around the corner.<eos> Walked through here and went in through the side door.<eos> Yeah, and the lock's still intact.<eos> It wasn't jimmied.
But would you mind explaining to me how I'm supposed to have killed the bitch?<eos> I can't leave this room, remember?<eos> Well, my, my, my.<eos> It's the defective detective once more.<eos> Lay it on me, Einstein.<eos> These two chairs are from the judge's house.<eos> The killer stood on one of them when he turned off the smoke alarm.<eos> A girl in the neighborhood saw, quote, a very, very fat man standing on it.<eos> But there's something funny about the chair.<eos> It's not broken.
Should I bring my clarinet?<eos> I could practice in the car.<eos> I'll just leave it right here.<eos> Close the door.<eos> What you are about to see cannot leave this room.<eos> The tabloids would pay a million dollars for this videotape.<eos> It's from the surveillance camera near the crime scene.<eos> The alley's a dead end.<eos> This is the only way in.<eos> The side door to the radio station was wired to an alarm, so we know it wasn't opened.
Yeah, I know.<eos> Burr ain't got to know that, though.<eos> He thinks Guerra gave you the shit, so our little peace treaty with the spics, it kind of fell apart.<eos> You know, Burr and Morales got into a little fandango, now they both in the hole.<eos> If Burr finds out you was the one that gave it to me,<eos> - he's gonna skin your fat hide.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Don't worry, son, I ain't gonna rat you out.<eos> I wanted those drugs.<eos> It don't matter who gave it to me.
- Pull your pants up, now. - All right.<eos> But, cookie... as someone who cares about you, let me say, I think you have some issues with men.<eos> I do right now.<eos> An older man can help you work through some of those father issues, cookie.<eos> Okay, don't "cookie" me, Freud.<eos> Pants up!<eos> Show some respect.<eos> This is Vogue!<eos> It turns out Julian had an agenda, as well.<eos> But it was cleverly hidden, of course.
No. I look good next to it.<eos> On it, I look like this.<eos> I'm not even really hungry.<eos> I pulled over because... you know, a bug hit my visor, and my hands are still shaking.<eos> So you're "uneasy rider."<eos> Well, if you make it to the Hamptons... my friend is having a party tomorrow afternoon.<eos> It's at Richard Wright's house.<eos> I heard about that.<eos> That's quite a place.<eos> I pass it on the way to my house.
Jeffrey can't repay you, so it's considered a great mitzvah.<eos> Kindness, love, for its own sake.<eos> Some people call that God.<eos> What I'm saying is, yes, definitely, forgive your mother and father.<eos> I mean, we've all heard that before, but what's become clear... is that my family of origin never really lived in a house.<eos> They lived in this tent city psychologically.<eos> It's no wonder that my own house never felt remotely like it was built on solid ground--<eos> Shut up.<eos> Shut the mouth.<eos> It was built on this quicksand of emotional incest...
I just get the sense that you're not fully dealing.<eos> All right.<eos> - Fine, I'll never give you advice again.<eos> - No, give me advice... just don't try and act like you really know anything.<eos> - Wait, is he nude?<eos> - No.<eos> God!<eos> $50,000.<eos> Do you have any idea how much this business is worth?<eos> Not much when it's shut down.
That's correct.<eos> What made you decide to look in her throat?<eos> I would have gone in there anyway to swab her out... before I started embalming her.<eos> - But I had my suspicions.<eos> - What made you suspicious?<eos> The contusions around her neck.<eos> These contusions could've been made when they tried to resuscitate her.<eos> They could have.<eos> If they tried to resuscitate, why didn't they find the frankfurter stuck in her airway?<eos> It was stuck pretty far down.
- How are things with Chloe?<eos> - Unresolved.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I don't know, just don't want to lose a friend in the process.<eos> Once you've crossed that line, you can't go back.<eos> Chloe gave that same advice about someone else.<eos> What happened?<eos> - Decided to stay friends.<eos> - Do you regret that decision?<eos> Yeah. I let that moment slip away and I don't think I'll ever get it back.
- I'm sure your intentions were noble.<eos> That's not fair. You don't understand how I regard Clark and your family.<eos> Yes I do, I understand perfectly well.<eos> We're just the pawns in your eternal chess game with your dad.<eos> - Do you have a family photo?<eos> - Yeah, I've got lots of family photos.<eos> The only picture of my father and me appears in the LuthorCorp annual report.<eos> Is this the part where I'm supposed to feel sorry for you?<eos> No, I just want you to understand... if I'm guilty of anything regarding your family, it's envy.<eos> If you're so envious of my family, then why do you feel the need... to investigate it behind my back?
You down there?<eos> Yeah, Pete, I'm all right.<eos> Hey, man, you gonna need some help, or can you jump your way out?<eos> I've got some company down here.<eos> He's a funny guy.<eos> As long as you're all right.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's the legend of Naman.<eos> My ancestors have passed down this story for generations.<eos> They said it had been written in the earth long ago... but nobody ever knew where it was until now.
So does anyone want coffee with their pie?<eos> You wanna have a look?<eos> I kind of like seeing them with my own eyes.<eos> So these legends, you don't think that they're like Venus and Apollo... and all the other myths?<eos> Just because something's a myth doesn't make it not true.<eos> Do you see the bright one right there?<eos> If you follow the stars around it, it makes the shape of a wolf's head.<eos> See how one of the eyes is missing?<eos> Our ancestors say that there used to be a star there... and that's where Naman came from.<eos> I wonder what happened to it.
Who's there?<eos> What're you doing?<eos> Minn!<eos> Your door was open.<eos> I brought you something from my ma.<eos> What are you doing in my house?<eos> Take it easy.<eos> I didn't know you were home.<eos> - Your car was gone.<eos> - It's being repaired.
What sights did you see on the videotape, Talangar?<eos> Is it the work of Sauron's magic?<eos> I'm not playing any more.<eos> What'd you see?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't want to know. I'm out.<eos> This thing must really be powerful.<eos> This tape makes people freak out wherever it goes. What do we do with it?<eos> One thing's for sure, this tape cannot be trusted with anybody.<eos> It must be returned to the video store from whence it came.
Im sure coming from you it'll hold more weight.<eos> The one found with the Antarctic gate died shortly after it was brought back.<eos> It was used a few times and then just ran out of energy.<eos> That was the first indication that the power sources have a limited life span.<eos> We've run a number of tests comparing the power source to other offworld DHDs.<eos> We think we have evidence that the gate down there is one of the oldest in the entire system.<eos> It could be as much as 50 million years old.<eos> The Antarctic plate wasn't covered by a glacier back then.<eos> The gate didn't necessarily originate there.<eos> It could have been moved at any time.
I was just about to try it out.<eos> The Greeks, Romans, Babylonians envisioned synthetic beings with human behaviour long before the words "robot" or "android" were ever uttered.<eos> Yeah. So?<eos> So it's been our nature to seek immortality through the creation of vessels for our consciousness.<eos> Vessels?<eos> Colonel O'Neill, Dr Jackson.<eos> Major Carter and I were just discussing whether or not to activate the robot.<eos> You can?<eos> I think I've found a way to recharge the main power cell.<eos> Prior to this, it's been operating on less than 1%% % capacity.
We're in this mess because you and your buddies are lying cowards,<eos> - Trying to cover your own incompetence.<eos> - Colonel. We desperately need the weapon we're developing.<eos> Without it, the Kelownan people could fall to our rival nations, who are developing their own powerful weapons as we speak.<eos> We will do whatever's necessary to ensure our freedom and a lasting peace.<eos> All right, let me be clear about something.<eos> I think this is the point Daniel was trying to make.<eos> A weapon of mass destruction can only be used for one thing.<eos> You might think it'll ensure peace and freedom, but I guarantee you, it'll never have the effect you're hoping for until you use it, at least once.<eos> Now, just for the record, the reason we want that stuff is because we think it could be used to create defence shields.
You created the largest expansion of college aid since the G.I. Bill cleaned up over 500 toxic waste dumps and you did it all while eliminating 16,000 pages of federal regulations.<eos> Not bad for government work.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll add my thanks, and I'll need your letters of resignation by 7:00.<eos> There have been more Shehab missile tests. Is the White House concerned?<eos> We are.<eos> I think all the Bahrain signatories are. We're expressing that concern through the appropriate channels. John?<eos> Can you give us a preview of the APEC address?<eos> He's been working out some new material and it has absolutely been destroying on the campuses.<eos> Showtime will have their cameras at APEC to record it for the president's one-hour special called Bartlet:
C.J. says AP asked for his transcript and he said no.<eos> - Why? - He took a semester of tap.<eos> - Seriously. - I don't know.<eos> I'll ask him.<eos> - And about the Iowa thing?<eos> - It may not get an answer today, okay?<eos> I don't wanna give him too much.<eos> When you say something like that, I buy canned goods.<eos> - What's with this tape?<eos> - You don't wanna see it on television.

- Can't campaign without a candidate.<eos> - Campaign of ideas.<eos> - The candidate died.<eos> But not the ideas.<eos> The metaphor alone knocks me down.<eos> - Elsie!<eos> - Mr. Bailey.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I'm getting cold feet about the bow tie.<eos> You like it, but for me, my whole world becomes about it.
Broadcasting live at 9:00 tonight on the East Coast... ... and tape delayed on the West Coast.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Okay.<eos> I understand it was the last debate of the first campaign.<eos> - Everything all right? - No.<eos> Before the debate the president went out to sneak a cigarette.<eos> - He lit his necktie on fire.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Josh gave him his, he won, and now it's his game tie.<eos> It got wrecked by a cleaning solvent we probably shouldn't use anymore.
That's why he tripled small-business start-up loans.<eos> That's why he's balancing the budget.<eos> Go.<eos> - It's so warm in here.<eos> - Go.<eos> - Donna?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Have you seen my copy of the president's private schedule?<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> - It's stamped"D-12."
I think you foul it off.<eos> Yeah, well, he keeps coming back at me.<eos> You invited him back this time, didn't you?<eos> All right.<eos> So what are you doing? - Just playing some chess.<eos> - Stay right there.<eos> - Tommy, it's me.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - She ran the card.<eos> - It must be bent.
I appreciated you coming to the cemetery with me.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - So it's been a year.<eos> Why don't you organize the search for a new executive secretary.<eos> Yes, sir. Absolutely.<eos> I may not like the first couple of candidates. It may take a while.<eos> No, I don't imagine we're actually gonna hire somebody, but this is a step.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you, Mr. President.<eos> "Eliminating the term 'North' from North Dakota is an important state issue and the president feels it should be resolved on a state level.
We're gonna go to the residence, but I'll take you through the Portico.<eos> Josh?<eos> Wouldn't you like to sit someplace and talk?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Why the tour?<eos> - You don't think this is interesting?<eos> - It's fascinating...<eos> If somebody sees us, I'd like them to see me giving you a tour.<eos> Who built the White House?<eos> It was designed by an Irish architect named James Hoban who won the job in an open competition.
- It's worth a shot.<eos> The U.S. Constitution defends religious pluralism.<eos> It doesn't reduce all of Islam to fanaticism.<eos> Neither does the speech.<eos> It calls fanaticism, fanaticism.<eos> It's fanaticism whether we call it that or not, so we're gonna call it that.<eos> - We respect all religions, cultures.<eos> - To a point.<eos> Yes, to a point.<eos> Grotesque oppression isn't okay just because it's been institutionalized.
It probably is, but it's tricky for somebody who's still trying to get his father to stop hitting him.<eos> Well, I'm told that most men lead lives of quiet desperation.<eos> Yeah, but that's most men.<eos> That's not you.<eos> That's the other people, the ones who feel stress.<eos> - You're destined for something else.<eos> - I have abilities.<eos> And now you have an opportunity to use them.<eos> I think I have.<eos> That room I passed down the hall on the left, it's got a name, right?
- We don't know exactly.<eos> We're having a hard time trying to find people who know her really well.<eos> I'm not sure I can help.<eos> We'd talk at dinner... trade stories about moving to New York and stuff.<eos> So do you know where she was from?<eos> Anything about her family?<eos> Not really.<eos> She was always pretty quiet about her past.<eos> Okay, I just got word from Eve's credit card company.<eos> Remember Viv said that it was maxed out?

- We both are. Our faith is what held us together.<eos> Eric, do you have any idea where she may have gone?<eos> No, she's got no family, no money.<eos> Agent Fitzgerald.<eos> That's a.38.<eos> There's been some break-ins in the area.<eos> I have a license.<eos> - Can we take a look?<eos> - Of course.<eos> She must've taken it.
Where?<eos> Oh, yeah, i think it is.<eos> "Oh, my god, it's the gladiator guy!<eos> Oh my god, i've never seen an actor before!"<eos> Why don't you choke on some pig vomit, you stupid sods!<eos> Why can't this guy control his temper? Well?<eos> You all just gonna stand there Or are you gonna fight? !<eos> Ooh! Crikey! You done it now!<eos> This tv is great, chef.<eos> Yeah, and it's got all kinds of cool features, too!
Like this?<eos> go.<eos> one-two.<eos> Oh boy.<eos> Reki!<eos> Good morning! We picked up some breakfast!<eos> thank you.<eos> Rakka. I'm glad.<eos> really. How's the fever?<eos> it was all gone when I woke up this morning.
Hello?<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> Paul, you jerk!<eos> You can't leave me like this!<eos> I'm not going anywhere!<eos> Remember when we went fishing a couple of summers ago?<eos> I was putting the boat in the water and the trailer sank?<eos> The tow truck tried to pull us out and it got dragged in, too.
They where grilled. -I could not know it.<eos> Asshole!<eos> -I swear.<eos> I did not have any choice.<eos> Why?<eos> -The letter. It was an order.<eos> An order from the devil himself.<eos> Nonsense!<eos> -I Swear. I Swear.<eos> It was written with blood.
That's from a cat or something.<eos> It's a pretty big cat, Patrick.<eos> Cat, dog, whatever.<eos> I got a really great deal on this place. A really great deal, man.<eos> They couldn't give it away. It was dead meat stinking up their books for 20 years.<eos> Don't do that, Maurice.<eos> Stop playing, man.<eos> The last owner on the lease, before the bank... was back in '79.<eos> Some cat named Jimmy Bones.<eos> It's been empty ever since.
No-fucking-way it's not gonna be!<eos> It's not easy for me!<eos> Hello, it's me ... leave a message ...<eos> Diane, the car is waiting.<eos> Are you ok?<eos> You comin'?<eos> Good ...<eos> It means so much to me.<eos> Go on ... the car is right outside the house..<eos> It's been waiting, ok?
So you see, it IS freezing outside!<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> It's just the ...migrant workers.<eos> Maybe we don't need so many.<eos> I sometimes wonder if we need them at all.<eos> They cost so much money!<eos> I want you to tell me what will happen to that stick.<eos> It will drown!<eos> Suppose it doesn't.<eos> It will get stuck in the rocks!
I want you to tell me what will happen to that stick.<eos> It will drown!<eos> Suppose it doesn't.<eos> It will get stuck in the rocks!<eos> Suppose it doesn't get stuck?<eos> We don't really need all these workers?<eos> What is it you suddenly have against our poor workers?<eos> It will stay in the water and rot!<eos> No.<eos> It will get stuck in the whirlpool or it can go down with a waterfall and crash!
We are not the ones who set life's appointments.<eos> But those who remain, especially the parents, ask themselves why.<eos> God has set this appointments, even if we do not know why.<eos> AII we can do is use our faith to deal with something that surpasses our understanding.<eos> The bible says: "If the master knew when the thief will come, he would not be robbed."<eos> In the same way, we do not know when the Lord will call us.<eos> The body of Christ.<eos> The body of Christ.<eos> Look at this cup:<eos> it's chipped.
I don't understand.<eos> Who is Bonny?<eos> I'm looking for Mr. Vargas.<eos> That is a question Luis would soon be asking.<eos> My name is Russell.<eos> I am Julia's sister.<eos> So you understand how upset I was to receive this letter.<eos> Upset?<eos> But...<eos> I... I thought you would be pleased to receive it.
- I'm feeling fragile.<eos> I shouldn't be alone.<eos> You're insane!<eos> (truck horn blares) I'm unhappy.<eos> It's not the same thing.<eos> Hey, I'm a fugitive from justice.<eos> I'm a dangerous criminal.<eos> - Oh. Well, that explains the hijacking.<eos> - You hit me!<eos> You can't expect to step in front of a moving car and stop it.
- Can I stay with you ?<eos> Come on. I'll be your bodyguard.<eos> Wait... my bag.<eos> No problem.<eos> Amanda, I can't talk right now.<eos> See you at the station.<eos> Bye.<eos> Mister !<eos> - Where is the file, you bitch ?<eos> - Give it to me !
You'll be okay.<eos> Relax.<eos> Ruby?<eos> You'll be okay.<eos> -Get her pulse.<eos> -Can you hear me, Ruby?<eos> "They are as asleep.<eos> In the morning, they're like grass which groweth up.<eos> In the morning, it flourisheth and groweth up.<eos> In the evening, it is cut down and withereth for we're consumed by thine anger and by thy wrath we're troubled.
One down and one up.<eos> Fuck me!<eos> The five of bats.<eos> You got the wheel up.<eos> What's your wager?<eos> Five bucks.<eos> Helena?<eos> Hey.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Weather station's tracking a huge storm across the southern sector... and we're right under it by now.
Look... even if we get back to Chryse, those things will just keep coming.<eos> We've got a chance here.<eos> We've got a chance to stop this thing before it goes any further.<eos> This is about one thing-- dominion.<eos> It's not their planet anymore.<eos> What about him?<eos> Isn't it our job to take him back?<eos> Is he still a prisoner or is he one of us?<eos> I can give a damn about saving this planet.<eos> Seems like it's been after me since the day I was born.
- Before the staircase moves again.<eos> Does anybody feel like we shouldn't be here?<eos> We're not supposed to be here.<eos> This is the third floor.<eos> It's forbidden.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - It's Filch's cat!<eos> - Run!<eos> Quick, let's hide through that door!<eos> - It's locked! - We're done for!
He's put a spell on the harp.<eos> It's got horrible breath.<eos> - We have to move its paw. - What?<eos> Push.<eos> I'll go first.<eos> Don't follow until I give you a sign.<eos> If something bad happens, get yourselves out.<eos> Does it seem a bit quiet to you?<eos> The harp.<eos> It's stopped playing.
It was bound to happen, I suppose.<eos> Forgive me!<eos> I heard a noise and I took the gun from your bag!<eos> - Rosalie, you've just shot my husband!<eos> Goddamn!<eos> Are you digging for potatoes?<eos> Go easy!<eos> I didn't tell you how to get this projectile in.<eos> Do not presume to tell me how to get it out.<eos> - It is lodged in the fleshy tissues.
Things have been tough for dreamers.<eos> They say dreaming's dead. No one does it anymore. It's not dead.<eos> It's just been forgotten.<eos> Removed from our language.<eos> Nobody teaches it, so no one knows it exists.<eos> The dreamer's banished to obscurity.<eos> I'm trying to change that.<eos> I hope you are too by dreaming every day.<eos> Dreaming with our hands and minds.<eos> Our planet is facing the greatest problems it's ever faced. Ever.
And then we'd sit on the curb and eat our popsicles.<eos> That's pretty profound, huh?<eos> Sounds nice.<eos> There's something we need to talk about.<eos> That you need to think about.<eos> My cancer's not being cured, is it?<eos> No.<eos> They never expected it to be, did they?<eos> They thought the drugs would make the tumor get smaller.<eos> And it has, it's gotten a lot smaller.
Come here. Come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> I want my ball.<eos> Kyle, I understand that, but look on the bright side.<eos> -You still have one healthy one.<eos> -You don't understand.<eos> I want to take it home with me, and the nurses said I can't do that.<eos> It's not a tooth, Kyle.<eos> It belongs to me.<eos> I miss it.
- Fuckin' kike!<eos> It will no Ionger be true that the country has a unified set of core beliefs.<eos> We will cease to be a nation in the traditional sense... ..and become instead a confederation of interest groups... ..like medieval principaIities.<eos> At the same time, we will flow into the anonymous sea of the global market.<eos> The economic advantages are obvious,... ..but the cultural, psychological...<eos> Where I grew up in South Boston,... ..when a kid walked down the street, everybody knew his name.<eos> He runs out in front of a car, someone says "Jimmy Dunn, get back on that sidewalk... ..and you stay there!"<eos> After high school, he sees his uncle at the gas works or the shipyard,... ..he gets his apprenticeship.<eos> Eight years later, he's making $16.50 an hour,... ..he's got four kids, he's playing ball and going from...<eos> Today, that kid walks down the street,... ..it's filled with trash, half the faces are black,... ..the shipyard's closed, only jobs left at the gasworks are set-asides.
F-o-s-t-e-r.<eos> OPERA TOR: No, sir.<eos> There's no Fosterin 818.<eos> OPERA TOR: Should I try the 310 again?<eos> Sir?<eos> I'm trying to help you, sir.<eos> Well, I've been up all night.<eos> Trying to call everybody.<eos> I called Maddy and Lainie and your friend Foster... who apparently doesn't believe in telephones.<eos> Honey, I know you don't want to go to this school... but it's supposed to be extraordinary.
Call him!<eos> Professor Thon is unavailable.<eos> - Nonsense!<eos> What?<eos> - This is just a test.<eos> You don't fool me!<eos> This is just a test.<eos> No, Mr. Berus!<eos> The experiment is over now.<eos> It has just been terminated.
credit has nothing to do with it.<eos> I'm concerned with public safety.<eos> -Is any of this true, Flemming?<eos> -Absolutely not.<eos> -Something's in my suit.<eos> -You're not going to believe him!<eos> Something's in my suit.<eos> -What?<eos> -There's something in my suit!<eos> That's impossible, it's sealed!
You ain't like Elwood here.<eos> You got guts.<eos> Guys like you get all the medals.<eos> Hey, Bob.<eos> Get your ass over here.<eos> There's someone I want you to meet.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> He murdered your car?<eos> Yeah, shot to pieces.<eos> The entire unit used it for target practice.
- Why'd the kid come back?<eos> Listen.<eos> He don't come back, you're on some island.<eos> - I got an idea.<eos> - You should've left him on the road.<eos> You shouldn't have left him with the plans!<eos> What plans?<eos> He forgot his cheat sheet.<eos> That's why he came back.<eos> He didn't forget it, because I got it right here!
Sally and Joe.<eos> Evie and I have put together a little balletic love poem in their honor.<eos> "The ballad of Sally and Joe."<eos> Ladies and gentlemen.<eos> -Okay?<eos> -Yeah, I'm ready.<eos> Have you ever seen love like this?<eos> Ever witnessed marital bliss?<eos> There it is right in front of you.<eos> Don't you wish you could have it too?
That's not for you to say.<eos> You're hardly a judge of what is my department musically.<eos> If you want your pupils to have a career instead of you ...<eos> No one must surpass you, my girl.<eos> Don't be dizzy ...<eos> Don't worry, Mama.<eos> THE PIANO TEACHER<eos> A little less pedal wouldn't go amiss.<eos> It's not enough just to take your foot off.<eos> A note may not be as long as it is written and may not be marked as long as it should be held.
By then, they took care of the poetry and I of the flesh.<eos> This leg...<eos> I don't like to think about this leg.<eos> It hurts.<eos> Some days I can't bear it.<eos> But I need it to stay on my feet.<eos> I saw those lights again today, in the sky.<eos> That's the war, it'll never end.<eos> The war's shit.<eos> Well, like it.
But not now.<eos> Why?<eos> Next time.<eos> Okay, next time.<eos> Get out!<eos> He almost cried? Really?<eos> Because of his father?<eos> The mother? Tell me.<eos> - I barely scratched the surface.<eos> - Well, it was never scratched before.
Come on!<eos> My car!<eos> I parked it there!<eos> My car's been nicked!<eos> How dumb can I get?<eos> I left it there yesterday.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Wait!<eos> Don't...<eos> - Don't worry. It's leased, like everything else.
That you're a daddy's boy?<eos> Primer on David Aames, Senior.<eos> 'My father wasn't built for the 21st century. '<eos> He never went to McDonalds.<eos> He never watched television, yet his biggest magazine is still the "TV Digest".<eos> 'He and my mother threw the grandest parties of the literary world.<eos> 'Ballooned, jumped out of aeroplanes.<eos> He sought adventure. '<eos> His autobiography is the manual for every cut-throat publisher in New York.<eos> It's called "Defending The Kingdom".
- Nothing happened!<eos> - Mary, something did happen.<eos> That's why we have these sessions, to help you remember.<eos> No, I can't remember.<eos> File note. Patient shows extreme agitation.<eos> She is putting her fingers in her mouth.<eos> Will you share a doll, Mister Doctor?<eos> Who am I speaking with?<eos> Mary Hobbes got a china doll from her mother.<eos> We can't find it now.
If it's not in the dictionary it doesn't count!<eos> It doesn't have to be in the dictionary!<eos> It does have to be in the dictionary!<eos> When we get back to the base, it's coming off.<eos> You touch my "limo" and I'll spank you, Nightstalker.<eos> Yeah, promises.<eos> That's a nice beach down there.<eos> How's the water?<eos> Yeah, it's nice and warm.<eos> And it's loaded with sharks.
I know you're afraid.<eos> Don't be.<eos> You know, someone once said:<eos> "You have nothing to fear but fear itself."<eos> And fear breeds failure.<eos> Come on.<eos> That's it. You've got to conquer your fear.<eos> Mike the Conqueror.<eos> Go on and look at that water.<eos> Get angry with it.
Like!<eos> Sugar is sweet!<eos> Flowers smell nice.<eos> All things grow in spring.<eos> And love?<eos> News from the Vatican.<eos> Pope John Paul II will open the Holy Door.<eos> During the Midnight Mass this Christmas.<eos> It symbolizes the door of heaven opening.<eos> The last time it was opened was in 1985.
The bass is a cool instrument.<eos> You go something like... "Good day."<eos> Maybe from time to time, your eyebrow goes like this.<eos> Glava, why so loud? Turn it down.<eos> - l'm only on 4.<eos> - Turn it down to 3, goddammit!<eos> What's wrong?<eos> - My shoulder.<eos> - Your shoulder?<eos> - l dislocated it.
And he just sat there beaming at me, grinning at me throughout the interview and I must have grinned back.<eos> He's been smiling at me for 43 years afterwards.<eos> Following 'Paths of Glory', Christiane and her daughter, Katharina moved with Stanley to Los Angeles.<eos> Stanley and Christiane were married in 1958 and Hollywood would be their home for the next few years where they were to have two more children, Anya and Vivian.<eos> For its damning portrayal of the French officer class 'Paths of Glory' would be banned in France for nearly 20 years.<eos> The film brought its director firmly to the attention of Hollywood.<eos> He was still only 28.<eos> I think that if the reigning powers had any respect for good pictures or the people who could make them that this respect was probably very well tempered by the somewhat cynical observation that poor and mediocre pictures might just as well prove successful as their pictures of higher value.<eos> Television has changed this completely.<eos> And I think that despite the unhappy financial upheaval it's caused in the movie industry it's also provided an invigorating and stimulating challenge which has made it necessary for films to be made with more sincerity and more daring.
Man, I can't believe it!<eos> BOD YGU ARD:<eos> Whoal Easy, easyl<eos> You're all about the passion, man!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I can't believe Mick--<eos> -Hi, Julie.<eos> -Hi, Rod.<eos> -How's the ankle?<eos> -Oh, it's busted.
It doesn't play dead, doesn't do anything. It's a pain.<eos> You are a pain.<eos> Hey, that tape is mine. Uh?<eos> - That's my tape.<eos> - No, it's mine.<eos> You gave it to me.<eos> I gave you back your things, now the tape is mine.<eos> - That tape is mine. - Uh?<eos> - That's my tape. - No, it's mine.<eos> You gave it to me.
Comeon.<eos> Move the clothes.<eos> That way.<eos> Given the circumstances, it's the best we could do.<eos> May God welcome them to his breast.<eos> May Allah help them.<eos> May the blessed prophets guide them.<eos> So, do we have an agreement?<eos> We'll cover the entrance today.<eos> It will be sealed forever.
Here you are.<eos> -Anything else?<eos> -No, nothing.<eos> Letter for you.<eos> Yes.<eos> Federico, this is Siponto.<eos> Beautiful, isn't it?<eos> The earthquake was not so serious.<eos> There is still green, sea, new houses and some old ones I can recognize.<eos> My school is still standing. It's name is Scola Domus. Please, tell this to Peter.
She talked, as usual, and she used words... to bring forth a certain choreography.<eos> But then she had a very experienced dancer in Frank... and then she allowed us to move freely.<eos> And many people feel that death is a release... and you go into something else.<eos> I had no feelings about that.<eos> There was never any question in my mind.<eos> All I can think about was the absolute abyss of death.<eos> After death, to me, there is just nothing.<eos> I think it was the scenes where she had sort of a running in it.<eos> That's what I felt like doing.<eos> I felt, if I could just outrun death... if I could just get away from it, the whole thought of it.
That's just her physical being, her spirit... is right here!<eos> Nonsense!<eos> If someone else's spirit is in you, where is your own?<eos> You want to know?<eos> Come in and find out!<eos> Red!<eos> Enigma!<eos> Thunder Sword!<eos> No! the Blood Cave will suck your sword away!<eos> It's got my sword!
I did not come here to make an exclusive agreement between Egypt and Israel.<eos> That is not part of Egypt's policy.<eos> The problem is not Egypt and Israel.<eos> Even should peace be achieved between all the front nations - and Israel, without a just solution to the Palestinian problem it shall never achieve permanent, just peace upon which the whole world insists today<eos> I did not come to you aiming at partial peace meaning, ending the war at this stage and deferring the whole problem to a later phase.<eos> Between you and us there was a high wall which you built over a quarter of a century. But it was destroyed in '73 and we should admit that.<eos> Another wall remains a complex emotional barrier between you and us.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen<eos> I say to you frankly.<eos> Peace is not true to its name unless it is built on friendship not the occupation of other peoples' land.
I'm the police down here in Ystad.<eos> This is Gustav Wetterstedt's mother.<eos> Has anything happened?<eos> Are you still there?<eos> Who was it?<eos> Kurt!<eos> It was his mother.<eos> Can you find out where she lives. See if there are maybe colleagues who can take care of it.<eos> This light does not work.<eos> It holds, but it has been unscrewed.
Financial Department<eos> Are you...<eos> Sally?<eos> I knew it's you.<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> On my way here...<eos> Hey, wait!<eos> So it's you?<eos> The car, is it you who left the car inside the tunnel?<eos> So it's still not fixed yet?
The profession of these honest stonemasons, as humble as it is noble.<eos> In those days all the houses were built of stone.<eos> A beautiful tradition that is now lost, as can be seen in the old houses and palaces, and in what remains of the old wall around the city.<eos> As sweet-toothed as I was, when they used to take me to the confectioner's shops in the afternoon, I used to hide, hoping to be left behind, and to be able to enjoy all those pastries.<eos> The Confeitaria Oliveira a cake-shop was my favourite and was considered to be the most chic.<eos> But I wasn't attracted by the luxury...<eos> - It was the pastries! - It was the pastries.<eos> There were the "babˆhs" and others. But the puff pastries with egg-paste filling, the ones they called "cocˆus" those were really good.<eos> Those pastries are delicious!<eos> But the cake-shop disappeared, and the cakes went with it.
Good book.<eos> A little slow though. But that's okay.<eos> They never make fuckin' toast properly.<eos> What a pain!<eos> What are you doing here? - How'd you get in?<eos> - That's easy.<eos> A friend in maintenance owed me a little favour.<eos> And talking about favours, now you owe me one.<eos> The suitcase. The old lady went to pick it up.<eos> We'll never know what was in it.
It's the most amazing recovery I've ever seen.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> Fausto, have you lost your speech?<eos> But... but what are you doing?<eos> Dying has become so indecent that it is disguised and sterilised... between clean and opaque hospital walls.<eos> Death exists.<eos> It forms pan of life.<eos> It may be the non-life.<eos> Although it's been repressed, exiled... from the social awareness it had belonged to... the greatest deceit for the dying...
Don't you remember?<eos> Besides, she has some nice girlfriends.<eos> Realty, she has a young friend, doctor...<eos> - Don't tempt me.<eos> - Don't tempt me!<eos> Sure ltempt you. That's what we're here for.<eos> I love young people-<eos> Thank you so much!<eos> My case.<eos> I don't know what I'd have done without it.
Let me see your face.<eos> Hey, let me see your face.<eos> Get yourself something to eat.<eos> And stay away from home for a while.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> Look.<eos> At the root of your tongue, there's a mass growing.<eos> It's cancer of the oropharynx.<eos> You have a malignant tumor.<eos> It's spread to the cervical lymph gland.
But they will make you hate yourself enough to listen to them...<eos> How did you get here ?<eos> I took the path you showed me.<eos> You found them by looking over the building plans ?<eos> This brings back memories...<eos> When the world was plagued by war, all castles were full of these hidden passages.<eos> You know about such old things...<eos> You're a witch, aren't you ?<eos> While I was playing pranks in this form, the source of my magic was stolen.<eos> Without it, I can't return to normal.
You...<eos> Why are you here ?<eos> I see, so you removed the stone of the water snake.<eos> Damn, so everything is your fault...<eos> You do understand that it isn't magic, but just a simple tool.<eos> Return the stone to me !<eos> If it's so simple... You can just create it again.<eos> Why don't you do it ?<eos> Your magic is ancient, but it's no different from artisan techniques.<eos> It was created by human hands for other humans to use, wasn't it ?
I was amazed by what he didn't know<eos> But there was more that he did know and had never talked about before.<eos> But one interesting thing that hasn't been made public.<eos> You know, so much was made of the fact that the credit cards were never used.<eos> They were used.<eos> An American Express card, part of the Netcom collection... was used in Raleigh within two days after Kevin was arrested.<eos> So who used it?<eos> -How did you find this out?<eos> -l've just known it for a long time.<eos> You're saying the credit card was used in Raleigh... and it was used after he was arrested?
Why not come with me? I'll show you something.<eos> What?<eos> Something to hear and touch.<eos> Please, cut the religious crap.<eos> Just wait. Maybe you'll find something.<eos> Where were you?<eos> You should have come.<eos> Maria took us to a procession.<eos> To rid people of their sins and help them look to the future.<eos> The music was cool, you could really get off on it.
You have no idea what the consequences would be.<eos> I know what the consequences are if we do nothing. So do you.<eos> I have a chance to change all that.<eos> If Starfleet Command knew what you were trying to do...<eos> You haven't told them?<eos> The Doctor and I decided to keep things in the family.<eos> What about your crew?<eos> I told them I needed to take you back to Starfleet Medical because you'd contracted a rare disease.<eos> I hope it isn't terminal.<eos> No... but it has been known to affect judgment.
Would you like a cup?<eos> No, I gave it up years ago.<eos> I only drink tea now.<eos> I told the curator at the museum that if he wanted to make the ready room more authentic, he should always keep a steaming pot of coffee on the desk.<eos> Voyager's in a museum? Voyager is a museum...<eos> on the grounds of the Presidio.<eos> On a clear morning, you can see Alcatraz from here.<eos> You made it back to Earth.<eos> Unfortunately, our favorite cup took a bit of a beating along the way.<eos> It was damaged during a battle with the Fen Domar.
- Sure. - Okay.<eos> Two days is not a vacation.<eos> You need to come back.<eos> - Maybe I'll open a branch office.<eos> - Great idea.<eos> Richard and Jane, this is Cassandra Lewis.<eos> Hello. Richard Wattle. You've got a little soot.<eos> - Richard.<eos> I brought you a little piece from my studio.<eos> It's called Gentle Soul.
But eccentric?<eos> No.<eos> Are you sure this isn't less about justice than it is about pinning the murder on Tyr?<eos> Pinning?<eos> Pinning?<eos> Your crewman was alone in a room with someone that he had every reason in three galaxies to want dead.<eos> That person is now dead.<eos> And with all your hemming and hawing, all you've succeeded in doing is to prove that he was shot with your man's gun.<eos> Thank you for the information.<eos> I'll make sure it's conveyed to the proper authorities.
So what are we gonna call you?<eos> Anything you like.<eos> Do you know "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"?<eos> An ancient Earth novel about a mysterious ship's captain seeking vengeance against his enemies.<eos> And what did they call him?<eos> The Latin word for "no one":<eos> Nemo.<eos> Still nothing?<eos> And the saddest part is, I could probably fly this wreck, if I had to.<eos> But I'll be damned if I know what it's called or where I'd go.
I always will be.<eos> These physical reactions. I didn't know Harper was so good.<eos> The Commonwealth needs you, Andromeda.<eos> The crew needs you.<eos> I need you.<eos> So, permission to chop yourself into pieces is officially denied.<eos> Understood.<eos> Does it get any better?<eos> Does the pain go away?<eos> I don't think it's supposed to. It's part of what it means to be alive.
Well, maybe if you told me more about it... I'd know if I've seen it.<eos> OK.<eos> - She wasn't brought in.<eos> - Which is a happy thing, right?<eos> - l don't know, I...<eos> - ..in the break room.<eos> You guys gotta see him.<eos> His head's almost twisted clean off.<eos> Glory.<eos> So this Key thing... it's been around for a long time?
Xander, Giles left me in charge. Tell her.<eos> - Judge Xander requesting a recess.<eos> - You shouldn't pull him into this.<eos> Yeah, see? Tara's with me.<eos> Protect me, Tara.<eos> Xander, what I'm doing, it's a good thing.<eos> And if it doesn't work, Giles never even needs to know about it.<eos> Oops.<eos> The cash resister.<eos> What did you do with it?
General Motors uses a thinner, yellow fluid with Dexron.<eos> When Dexron's put into a Ford, it thins that type F fluid.<eos> Friction builds, gears grind.<eos> The second gear is the first to go Friction causes the engine to overheat in turn cooking the transmission fluid turning it brown.<eos> The leak on the pavement is the first clue you've got a problem.<eos> Well, congratulations. You're looking for a Ford with a leak.<eos> Not just a Ford.<eos> The getaway vehicle has a stubborn second gear.<eos> Which means it can't get very far.<eos> My guess is it's already been dumped.
Real live fairy dust.<eos> Yeah. Turns grown men into criminals.<eos> What's the composition?<eos> Si-<eos> O2.<eos> Silica dust. Each particle's 100 times smaller than a grain of sand.<eos> I thought you guys were processing the car. Yeah.<eos> Um, what do you know about silica?<eos> It's used to make glass.<eos> It's mined in open pits. Why?
- Of course you may.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Is this guy the real deal?<eos> I think he's incapable of deception, Nick.<eos> We were just witnessing displaced anxiety.<eos> I mean, look around. Everything's in precise order.<eos> Organised by size.<eos> Order provides comfort.<eos> His whole life is based on routine.<eos> Without it, he can't function.
I wore nothing but skin. Ooh.<eos> I, uh, compared the DNA from the tooth with hairfollicles found inside the headdress.<eos> I think we have a match, sir. And I think we may have a homicide.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> So, did I break the law by not reporting it?<eos> It's a good idea that when your house is robbed you report that your registered gun was stolen.<eos> Guy's story checks out.<eos> He was robbed.<eos> My wife's not comfortable about having the gun in the house since we had our boy and I told her that I'd gotten rid of it but I never did.<eos> I mean, man, the last thing I ever expected was it'd be used in a murder.
- I told you!<eos> What you want is no longer in this box.<eos> I need more.<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> I gotta have more!<eos> You can never get enough greed, can you?<eos> The box.<eos> - The box belongs to Lukas!<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Well, tell Lukas it's been impounded.
Townspeople who stood there and watched me die.<eos> The only way is for me to give myself up.<eos> - No.<eos> - It's okay, Isabel.<eos> Have faith.<eos> They'll kill you.<eos> Maybe.<eos> This curse came from my father's people.<eos> I understand that now.<eos> It's meant to heal, to teach the townspeople to act without shame.
It's wonderful for you, we resent the recruitment.<eos> We don't need you.<eos> Everything's a big problem with you people!<eos> It's good to be home.<eos> There's my jacket, there's the guy you gave my jacket to!<eos> Can you help me out?<eos> -Remember me? I gave you the jacket.<eos> -Hi.<eos> That's my jacket, it looks really good on you.<eos> I'm glad you could use it, there you go.
I'm the guy who goes around telling people... that "my grandfather invented the Cobb salad"!<eos> - That's true.<eos> - That's me who does that?<eos> That's true.<eos> The Cobb salad, my friend, was invented in 1937... by Bob Cobb at the Brown Derby!<eos> That son of a bitch stole that salad from my grandfather.<eos> - Bullshit!<eos> - And you call my grandfather a liar?<eos> You're dead, you son of a bitch!<eos> It was invented in 1937... by Bob Cobb in the Brown Derby Restaurant.
She must fight to discover her destiny.<eos> So then I ran a search of university records.<eos> Figured if Sandeman was the genius behind Manticore, he'd probably have some sort of degree in genetics or biochemistry or something.<eos> - Anything turn up?<eos> - A couple of PhDs but nothing in sciences.<eos> - And what about the house?<eos> - Mm. His name wasn't on it.<eos> Mortgage held by an offshore corporation and the taxes paid from a numbered account.<eos> If you're splicing genes for a secret government agency, gotta make sure you cover your tracks.<eos> In May of '08, the bank repo'ed the property after six months of non-payment, and it's sat there empty ever since.
Maybe hours.<eos> - Then I'd better hear it now.<eos> - Hear what?<eos> - Your confession.<eos> - Bishop, I don't think...<eos> That's what you came up here for, isn't it?<eos> - I wanted to check on you.<eos> - You're searching for your faith.<eos> You think you lost it, but you only buried it.<eos> It's never left you.
As a matter of fact... you are.<eos> It's like a virus or a bot program.<eos> There are traces of Jaridian energy through the entire global comweb.<eos> Right there.<eos> That's a new spike of Jaridian energy.<eos> An auxiliary portal carrier on the mothership?<eos> An interdimensionnal track from this specimen portal on the medbay.<eos> That is a restricted portal, you need special authority to use it.<eos> So, how can there be Jaridian energy on the mothership?<eos> It was activated by a CVI.
He has been mine for too long.<eos> In the march of time, it hardly matters.<eos> There is a revolt underfoot.<eos> Da'an is formating a jaridian invasion.<eos> Come.<eos> We are using mental symbiosis to regenerate the data pods.<eos> Data shows that our robot satellite were vectored to form an interdimensional... portal around the freedom space station.<eos> - Federov's space station?<eos> - Indeed.<eos> It's now hidden in the rings of your sixth planet.
Yes, you do.<eos> Turn down that flame, please.<eos> I was hoping you could tell us a little bit more about this illness.<eos> Why don't you tell me why you were in Garos' shop.<eos> We were trying to get into the basement.<eos> We think there's some kind of machine there.<eos> Something he's not supposed to have.<eos> What kind of machine?<eos> We're not sure.<eos> But it may be indirectly connected to this epidemic.
Giant rocks falling from the sky...<eos> Shale, it's all shale!<eos> Take us back.<eos> I went through about two to 300 photographs before I found this.<eos> Look familiar, Nadet?<eos> It's the overside.<eos> Before the poison rain.<eos> And what about the people?<eos> Humans.<eos> What were humans doing in your colony before it was destroyed?
I'm thirsty.<eos> I'm just thirsty."<eos> All right, listen...<eos> I want you to prepare yourself 'cause you're about to get very mad at Robert.<eos> What is it?<eos> Where's your wedding ring?<eos> Robert.<eos> Robert's wearing your wedding ring?<eos> No, no, what happened was,<eos> I had it on the table in the hotel room--
Come on guys, let's get dressed, let's get dressed for the zoo, guys.<eos> Come on, come on, we're gonna go to the zoo and Daddy is gonna make his famous zoo snacks.<eos> That's your famous "zoo snack"?<eos> "Animal crackers," put it together.<eos> Who told Robert to "get a life"?<eos> Ray...?<eos> What? It could've been you.<eos> Oh, Raymond, how could you do that?<eos> Okay, first of all, you're only hearing one side of the story, okay?<eos> And you're taking it way out of context and blowing it way out of proportion.
No, no, no, no!<eos> Stark knows Talyn, he can help calm him down.<eos> Let me be your eye!<eos> Perfect!<eos> The half-blind leading the blind.<eos> No, he's right Rygel.<eos> Get in here.<eos> She likes me more than she likes you.<eos> What happened to this planet?<eos> Looks like it's been carpet bombed.
At least now you're speaking the truth.<eos> External pressure senses?<eos> Yank 'em all.<eos> I'm kind of in the mood to be destructive.<eos> What did you do? !<eos> I was checking the hangar.<eos> This started leaking.<eos> It regulates with self-venting!<eos> I tried to close the valve, but it wouldn't turn.<eos> Because it was already sealed! Mmm.
I don't wanna lose you.<eos> It's like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love..<eos> So I guess this is it. Yeah.<eos> -You smell just like her.<eos> -Yeah, so do you.<eos> -What are you doing?<eos> -I'm leaning.<eos> This is where I lean. Okay.<eos> -Brenda, a bee! -What?<eos> It's flown into your blouse, and you better undo your buttons lest it sting you.
- Good.<eos> How are you?<eos> Good.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Fixing your porch rail.<eos> - That's right.<eos> You're fixing my porch rail... at 6:30 in the morning!<eos> - It was the only time I could do it.<eos> - Why?<eos> It was broken.
Well, got to go.<eos> Have a really good summer.<eos> You're annoyingly on time again!<eos> Okay. Stairs, then shoes.<eos> - You're all dressed up.<eos> - I'm going out.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I forgot my toolbox, so I just thought I'd come pick it up.<eos> Yeah, it's right over here.<eos> We couldn't lift it or we'd have brought it to you.
- Hurry up and I'll drive you to school.<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> Why so charming this morning?<eos> I had an annoying visit from the Stars Hollow wake-up fairy.<eos> - Where's my tie?<eos> - In your drawer.<eos> - I'm looking in the drawer.<eos> - Check the living room.<eos> Why would it be in the living room?<eos> Because it's been seeing the doily on the coffee table.
- And hello to you, too.<eos> - Week after week. How do you do it?<eos> I told you, correct change.<eos> Go in for that dollar-bill nonsense... you'll be standing there for 10 minutes watching it.<eos> I thought you had a special relationship with this vending machine.<eos> Only in the sense that it keeps me alive.<eos> I actually have a theory on that.<eos> Ever since we were children, we got our nourishment from our mothers.<eos> Okay. Are you trying to gross me out so I can't eat my burrito?<eos> - Now we're getting it from machines.
- How do you like that mouth?<eos> - It's not very mouth-like.<eos> - I think it works.<eos> - It's tilted to the side.
Last Tuesday?<eos> - I don't know the exact day.<eos> Tuesday at 5:15? Is that when you discovered it?<eos> Don't mock.<eos> Well, tell me. What is...<eos> - Wait. It's a secret. You can't tell me.<eos> - No, I'll tell you.<eos> - You visualize the reality you want.<eos> - Visualize the reality you want.<eos> And then if necessary, you lie to bring it about.
You who have no dreams, rain on those who do.<eos> I say this because I care about you. It's risky, what you are doing. Most new businesses go down within two years.<eos> I say if we go down after two years... it'll be the most exciting two years of our lives.<eos> - Same here. Boredom stinks!<eos> - Fine. Proceed blindly.<eos> This came in 10 minutes ago. It does not involve The Independence Inn. Therefore, delivering it was beyond my official obligations... so I am taking an extra-long lunch break.<eos> He's so genuine.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - What?<eos> It's the title search for the Rachel property. Guess who owns it?
Goodbye, Nikita.<eos> Where's Adam?<eos> Can he see me?<eos> No.<eos> You have quite a reputation, Michael.<eos> GRAFF: Some say you're the best operative alive on either side.<eos> Do you think that's true?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, I like your confidence.<eos> You'll need it for the job that I have in mind.
- We've had endless discussions about it.<eos> - You don't use drugs? Of course not.<eos> Anyway, if something happened to her while she was on drugs-- well, you wanted to know what I thought.<eos> I put all my numbers on that sheet.<eos> As soon as we find something, we'll call you.<eos> No, I want to get your numbers.<eos> I'll be calling you.<eos> I just don't want to be the last to know.<eos> How do we like being an annex to the Missing Persons Bureau?<eos> This friends and neighbors list, it's alphabetized.
Yeah.<eos> - OK, next stop Crown Heights.<eos> - Right.<eos> I am completely innocent in this thing.<eos> We've got your car as the getaway in a double homicide.<eos> That's a long way from innocence.<eos> I admit to nothing.<eos> I'm really impressed with that car, Phil.<eos> - It's a work of art.<eos> - It's not finished.
I had no idea you'd go so far for this.<eos> I'd do it again in a minute.<eos> Then I guess I have a confession to make before you go and do something even stupider.<eos> My father's car is here.<eos> - Here where?<eos> - Here here?<eos> I looked around this morning and found it out here. I remember this attachment on the carburetor... this extra hose.<eos> - What is it doing out here?<eos> - [Guthrie] I thought it was junk.<eos> It's been sittin' here for 20, 30 years.
- Somethin's funky here. - You're telling us the government is behind this?<eos> - You're the government.<eos> If you're anything like your father, I knew you'd want to know.<eos> [ Frohike ] Hey, buddy, are you sure you want to do this?<eos> [ Langly ] That government guy said there wouldn't be any proof your dad was murdered.<eos> If he was murdered... there'd have to be a reason for it.<eos> Mr. Helm said maybe he knew something.<eos> I want to see what's on his P.C.<eos> Son of a--<eos> This carpet's wet. Like it's been cleaned.
All the feelings we share, That was in the past.<eos> That part is already forgotten.<eos> Craig ...<eos> Do not let that be reborn.<eos> If you can not have a chip in a locker, put a poster. I guess I'm not, I can not read minds.<eos> Look ...<eos> Do not, continue.<eos> There is a mini bike!<eos> Is going to throw?<eos> It would be great to have it!
- Like what?<eos> - Come back here.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Because I told you to.<eos> You get up so early.<eos> I have to stop that.<eos> I really shouldn't walk around here like this.<eos> I can't find that red blouse that you bought me. I wanted to wear it.<eos> - The one time I need tape.<eos> - l put it in the wash.
A salad?<eos> It had tofu on it.<eos> She did fine, Karen.<eos> Yeah, fine.<eos> I don't even know what that means anymore.<eos> I think we should let her go on the ski trip.<eos> I mean, I see her trying and I think she should be rewarded.<eos> - You're letting her manipulate you.<eos> - She is not.<eos> This approach might be working, and that would be wonderful, but only if we stick with it.
Let me tell you something about your friend<eos> Sam thinks that this is a game and we're playing it together.<eos> I win games.<eos> Which, for me, is the thing I like most about Sam.<eos> But I don't like him enough to keep him in this game, unless he comes through.<eos> You've been given a very lucky break.<eos> Now, use it!<eos> My grandfather used to say that luck is like a clock.<eos> It ticks.<eos> Tell your putzy little friend he's got two days to come up with something good, or it's stopped ticking and he's fired, along with you.
- Calm down.<eos> Why should I calm down?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I have to get to my ex-wife's house.<eos> My girlfriend's having a baby, I have to get the midwife to her.<eos> I have to get to her right now, please!<eos> Why did you put that nice blanket on the bed?<eos> I'll take it off.<eos> No, it's great.<eos> See, it's gone.
In the meantime, keep out of trouble.<eos> I hear you're a faggot.<eos> Whether I am or not, what's it to you?<eos> Lights go out, I don't want you getting any ideas.<eos> Trust me, Colonel, I'm never going to get that horny.<eos> As long as we understand each other.<eos> Fucking faggots are ruining the military.<eos> "Don't ask, don't tell," my ass.<eos> I agree.<eos> I think the military should stay the way it's always been, a bunch of redneck he-men who murder children and rape women.
Be on time.<eos> We're all set.<eos> I'm telling you, we gotta do something and fast.<eos> You know, I just got the funniest feeling the old man is gonna take care of everything.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Fuck!<eos> This shank is a classic.<eos> The bottom end of a toothbrush is carved down to its sharpest point, almost like an arrowhead.<eos> But the best part is, the weapon doesn't have to be concealed.<eos> It can be placed in the pocket, bristles showing, ready to be grabbed for action.
Next item, Gloria.<eos> The Wygert Corporation has asked us to participate in testing a new drug that they're developing.<eos> I'm against using prisoners as guinea pigs.<eos> Participation would be voluntary.<eos> Why would one of these jackasses volunteer?<eos> Benefit humanity? Come on.<eos> Wygert has also contacted the governor, who's agreed to reduce the sentences of those prisoners who cooperate in the experiment.<eos> Jeez, what does this drug do?<eos> Cure cancer?<eos> No, it's actually designed to reduce overcrowding in prisons.
There I said it, I don't like it, but I said it.<eos> Anyway, turns out Liz was right --<eos> Alex was murdered by an alien and the killer is still out there....<eos> Let me tell you what's really going on.<eos> Tess is pregnant.<eos> Maxwell's the dad.<eos> Here's the problem:<eos> the baby can't survive on earth, so we need to find a way home. Which fortunately, I think I did.<eos> This is a key.<eos> When we insert it the Granilith will transport us... home.
Postmodern.<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> Weird for the sake of weird. Oh!<eos> Where are the barstools?<eos> Up there.<eos> Ain't it trippy?<eos> Whatever. Just give me a Duff.<eos> We don't serve Duff no more.<eos> We got a Malaysian beer that's better than Duff.<eos> It's made out of soy sauce.
You had to hear him on the phone before. Talking to me like a child.<eos> You have any idea the money i made for him over the years?<eos> Or his old man before him?<eos> He's living like a fucking king and now all i hear about is cocksucker ralphie.<eos> I'm going to sleep. Let me get some of that carpet.<eos> I been working on a plan.<eos> A plan?<eos> We're in a truck, right?<eos> It had to get here somehow, there's gotta be a road out.<eos> It's grown over, it stops at those trees.
You injured my father.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I really am.<eos> We were just trying to take back an Unas that's rightfully ours.<eos> Stealing is wrong.<eos> Yes. It is.<eos> Trust me. A whole lotta people are gonna have to die before one Unas goes free.<eos> Colonel, do you read?<eos> - Yeah. What's your situation?<eos> - We're at the gate, sir, but it's guarded.
- So what does he wanna do?<eos> Stay and fight, and free the others.<eos> Daniel, we didn't come here to arm them.<eos> They did that themselves.<eos> I don't think we're gonna stop them.<eos> You just sent him out to start a war.<eos> It was his choice.<eos> I told him they didn't have to kill.<eos> Do you think he understands that?<eos> They know what freedom is and they're willing to fight for it.
Now what does that have to do with anything? You wanna help General Hammond, you have to get your hands dirty.<eos> Are you willing to see this thing through? Under no other circumstances would I sit here and watch you eat.<eos> Yeah, well, things are about to get a lot more dicey.<eos> They're onto us.<eos> Our only chance now is a more direct approach. Such as? We have to connect someone with influence to the on-line websites.<eos> The only way to do that now is straight through one of the high-profile associates.<eos> Who are we talkin' about here? An old friend. 50 minutes to target location, sir.<eos> - We have to stop the test.<eos> - Why is that? The aerial survey shows evidence of an old Goa'uld mine.<eos> It's probably been shut for thousands of years,... ..but there could still be a lot of naqahdah present.
Oh. And what are you going to do? Well...<eos> I was thinkin' about shootin' ya. Jack... what are you doing? Gettin' a little dirty for you, Maybourne?<eos> The iris is holding, but it's starting to heat up. - How long before it loses integrity?<eos> - I'm not sure.<eos> We may have turned that planet into a giant ball of superheated plasma.<eos> It could power the gate for months.<eos> - We have to autodestruct.<eos> - The other gate survived the explosion.<eos> - Would not ours as well?<eos> - At least it would be buried under rock.
Good luck.<eos> Try "Oscar".<eos> (Maybourne) That's it. We're in.<eos> I'm downloading now.<eos> Kinsey's on-line activities connect him to NID actions over the last year and a half,... ..including the secret operation I ran out of Area 51 ,... ..the involvement with the Russians... ..and the threats to Hammond.<eos> (O'Neill) You're a piece of work, Kinsey.<eos> You try to shut down the SGC.<eos> You make a speech about how you hate secret organisations,...<eos> - ..then jump in bed with the NID. - I still think the gate's a Pandora's box.<eos> It should be buried for ever.
Sir, I agree with Daniel. This is a life form - obviously intelligent.<eos> We've been in the same position as this alien entity I don't know how many times.<eos> On another planet, cut off from our world, trying to stay alive.<eos> What in God's name...? Well, General, whatever got into our computers apparently has built a nest. - Overnight?<eos> - According to the security log,... ..there hasn't been any human activity in the MALP room for 36 hours.<eos> For the record, sir, I want to blow it to hell.<eos> These folks want to chat with it. Are you absolutely certain it can't reconnect to our computers? General?<eos> It's surviving on an emergency circuit, so it's isolated from the rest of the base. We can kill it just by severing that connection.<eos> - How do you intend to proceed?<eos> - Well, sir, it's provided an interface.
Nor am I.<eos> There is no symbiote inside this creature.<eos> It could have left the body when it realised it couldn't heal the wound.<eos> It would not survive for long under those circumstances.<eos> Unless it found a new host.<eos> - Colonel O'Neill.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> We found the creature.<eos> - That's good news.<eos> - Only problem is the symbiote's not in it.
This pageant's your chance... to spread some Christmas spirit, and that's contagious, like V.D.<eos> I just...<eos> I don't think I have it anymore, Leo.<eos> Ah, don't be fooled, man.<eos> V.D. Comes back.<eos> No, not...<eos> Okay. Yeah, I'll watch for that.<eos> So. Dipping into the frankincense, I see.<eos> Well, no more of that.<eos> Okay? We're gonna do this play the way it was meant to be done.
No.<eos> I' m saying they' re too stupid to be protected by the courts.<eos> "T oo stupid to be--" Every day, the Justice Department uncovers evidence that cigarette companies knew, far better than the rest of us that smoking causes death and disease.<eos> T o say nothing of the CEOs being the Iast seven people on Earth to discover that nicotine was addictive--<eos> Your administration wants to prosecute a suit they know is hopeless so they score points at the expense of an industry that funds your opponents.<eos> It's politically correct extortion and that's why it's unlikely the appropriations bill will make it out of the subcommittee.<eos> It's almost 3:00.<eos> By 7, 3000 new people will have taken up smoking.<eos> 2,800 of them will be under 1 8.<eos> What do we use this place for when we' re not using it for this?
- It's half past midnight.<eos> See, here's the thing.<eos> This looks like spruce to me. Spruce is softwood.<eos> Softwood burns out quickly. - You know what we need?<eos> - A hardwood? - That's right.<eos> - Interesting.<eos> - Where did you get the wood? - It was sitting in the thing.<eos> I think that is meant to be decorative.<eos> We're not burning Benjamin Harrison's log cabin.<eos> It was made out of spruce. - Where's C.J.?
- No. - It was a breakfast.<eos> It was a damn photo opportunity.<eos> The year is one week old. The legislative session hasn't begun. We can't put a forkful of waffles in our mouth without coughing up the ball.<eos> You got beat.<eos> I have press in 10 minutes.<eos> Figure it out.<eos> Tell me what you're gonna do.<eos> We can take the highroad say we don't want it to disintegrate into a war of words.<eos> We don't wanna disrupt a fragile peace.<eos> It's been disrupted.
It was three years ago, she can't expect...<eos> It's C.J. Stackhouse has an autistic grandson.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - C.J., we're coming up.<eos> - Charlie.<eos> - He's just coming over.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Can we wait?<eos> - Yeah. Look, one of us is going to have to tell the president that the statue's broken.<eos> - It's not broken.
- I'm not gonna tell you.<eos> - Come on, man.<eos> What'd you have?<eos> - Forget it.<eos> A pair of 3s?<eos> What is this?<eos> It's called good card playing.<eos> You looked at my hand.<eos> I wouldn't look at your hand, Rob.<eos> I know where it's been.
If this guy was gonna shoot me, he had his chance.<eos> Besides, I'm sweatin' like a pig.<eos> Mr Melnick, what's this?<eos> It's a tunnel from the old system.<eos> Been shut down for years.<eos> You see this, Agent Scully?<eos> You have this on your graphic?<eos> Yeah. lt's a fork in the line.<eos> That line is obsolete.<eos> It's been gutted and decommissioned.
That's why you're so determined to fiind Mulder alive.<eos> It's why I can't stand here and listen to all this mumbo jumbo about spaceships.<eos> I saw what I saw,John.<eos> I'm not going to lie to you.<eos> But whatever it was, it led to this.<eos> It's the man I saw in the fileid.<eos> He goes by the name Absalom.<eos> Disgraced when they didn't, he fled and tried a more ecumenical scam: credit card fraud.<eos> I ran the plate on the pickup truck.<eos> It's registered to a farm about an hour from here.
Take it easy! Take it easy!<eos> The doors open inwards.<eos> It's very important we don't lose control.<eos> Very... important!<eos> What papers are you looking for?<eos> What papers?<eos> An official report.<eos> A very troublesome report which is supposed to clarify why we can't afford to work.<eos> You'll just have to write a new one!<eos> Try to remember what was in it.
Two squadrons, General<eos> That is the job of a major.<eos> Major Gervasio must take command of the troops who occupy the Carmo.<eos> He's under me, I've already spoken with him.<eos> He's a competent man.<eos> Somebody must take the President to the airport.<eos> The captain can be in charge of that.<eos> Here's the command post of the Armed Forces.<eos> To finish the last communiqué, the Movement of the Armed Forces informs the nation, that it was able to break into the quarters of the National Guard in Carmo plaza. where the ex-President of the Council and members of his ex-government.<eos> The Movement of the Armed Forces thanks the civil population for all the affection and support shown to it's soldiers and stress the need to maintain civic values at this high level.
For saving our lives.<eos> You know,<eos> I come up here every night... and look out to that hill and just imagine what it must be like on the other side.<eos> It's funny, I've--<eos> I've never actually felt grass beneath my feet.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Here I am rambling on about hills and grass, and you had something to say.<eos> Uh, y-y-yeah.<eos> Um, it's just that, y-you know, life as I've experienced it, you know, out there, lone free ranging' and stuff, it's, uh, it's full of disappointments and, uh--<eos> What, you mean grass isn't all it's cracked up to be ?
Tony has been doing some informal polls.<eos> You're slipping.<eos> You're not behind yet, but you're slipping.<eos> You have to work harder.<eos> Come on, Caroline.<eos> Work harder?<eos> I went 18 places yesterday.<eos> My throat is killing me.<eos> Come on.<eos> My hand is so swollen, I can't put a glove on it.
It's not safe.<eos> All right.<eos> I won't.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I'm good.<eos> I really am.<eos> I miss you so much.<eos> I miss you, too.<eos> I'm being so irresponsible.<eos> I know when I made my decision, I kept to it.
Any belief to the contrary was in error<eos> You want war?<eos> However<eos> While there can be no quid pro on this issue the United States can offer a private assurance<eos> Our Jupiter missiles in Turkey are obsolete and have been scheduled for withdrawal for some time<eos> This withdrawal should take place within six months<eos> Of course, any public disclosure of this assurance would negate the deal and produce... the most stringent denials from our government<eos> This private assurance... represents the word of the Highest Authority?<eos> Yes<eos> And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Krushcev's ears to the top circles of my government?
He's got the guts of a Greek god.<eos> I don't care if he's Apollo, son of Zeus.<eos> That ball won't clear the water.<eos> - I hope you're all paying' customers.<eos> -Junuh!<eos> Junuh, don't-- - Shh.<eos> Hush yourself, Hardy.<eos> - If first you don't succeed. Which would make your spot... right here, Junuh.<eos> Give it to him.<eos> When Junuh dropped that ball, it was as if every heart in Savannah dropped with it,
I'm giving myself up.<eos> What do you want me to do? Die, you motherfucker.<eos> Put your hands clearly in the air and come out slowly.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here I come, lads.<eos> Keep walking towards us until we tell you to stop.<eos> You fellas are gonna be famous do you know that?<eos> Shoot the fucker.<eos> Put your gun down.<eos> Walk away from it.
What if the crowd had weapons?<eos> What if this shows they did fire first?<eos> He could have fired over their heads, this moron!<eos> Didn't he know where he was? The Middle East!<eos> He could have isolated on the snipers. He could have avoided confrontation.<eos> He could have done 50 fuckin' things!<eos> Instead, he destroyed a fragile trust, put his own men in danger...<eos> Fuck this guy!<eos> Forget this tape.<eos> I don't want to watch it. I don't want to testify about it.
Two more minutes.<eos> Hey! - Merry Christmas.<eos> - I thought you were gonna stiff me.<eos> - What is the ribbon?<eos> Is it a thousand-pound... - test fishing line or something?<eos> - Here's your fancy thing.<eos> I love the wrapping.<eos> - And I love the box.<eos> Oh, that is terrific.<eos> My granddaddy used it on the Southern Pacific.
Yeah, I'll tell him that.<eos> -Ready up here, chief.<eos> -Roll and record.<eos> Rolling.<eos> Subject, Isabelle Two.<eos> Currently in phase-shift, 126 hours.<eos> Testing D-phase protocol Serial lrradiated Protein Caine 125.<eos> Stop naming them after yourself, you'd have better luck.<eos> Thank you, Dr. Kensington, for that keen observation.<eos> I'll include it in my memoirs.
- She was high on a sugar rush... from pumpkin pie.<eos> This would look good on you. Couldn't keep still.<eos> So Chantal overreacted?<eos> Chantal never let you touch her after that?<eos> You know, there are many things that separate couples:<eos> infidelity... money, long illness.<eos> I'm separated from my wife by a hallway, a 60-foot hallway.<eos> in fact, it's a desert, that hallway.<eos> And at the very end, there's a door.<eos> And when it's locked, you can knock all you want... but that door won't open.
So was that before Leslie?<eos> Before us?<eos> I've never met anyone like you, Betty.<eos> Well, that's why we're meant to be together.<eos> Your dedication scares me.<eos> Well, it's easy to be dedicated when you care about something.<eos> When I met you, it was like a warm breeze had suddenly blown into my life.<eos> You remember that line? I said that to Leslie during her funeral.<eos> I love that line.<eos> Well you said it to her but you meant it for me, didn't you?
- Wait, check me out.<eos> - Excellent!<eos> Judges give it a ten!<eos> - Mr. Keane...<eos> - Tell me.<eos> The repeat MRI and CAT scan show interval progression.<eos> - The tumor's grown.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Considerably.<eos> It's begun to obstruct the outflow from her heart.
-Are you sure?<eos> -No.<eos> -Then this could be the border.<eos> Ok, let's assume that this is the border.<eos> So what?<eos> I'll just drive across.<eos> -I'll accellerate from a distance, hit the ramp and jump across the river.<eos> -That's crazy!<eos> -We need the car.<eos> -We can manage without it.
Ah! Remunerathion.<eos> Thou monster ignorance, how deformed dost thou look!<eos> Madam, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred in a book.<eos> He hath not eat paper, as it were;<eos> ..he hath not drunk ink.<eos> His intellect is not replenished;<eos> ..he is only an animal,... (Nathaniel chuckles) (clucking) ..only sensible in the... duller... parts.<eos> And such barren plants are set before us that we thankful should be - ..Which we of taste and feeling are - ..for those parts that do... fructify in us more than he.<eos> Good Master Parson,... ..be so good as to read me this letter.<eos> It was given me by Costard and sent me from Don Armado.
They work from within.<eos> It seems to me... that the modern artist cannot express this age... the radio... in the old forms of the Renaissance... or any other past culture.<eos> How do you go about getting the paint on the canvas?<eos> I understand you don't use brushes or anything of that sort.<eos> I paint on the floor.<eos> That's not unusual.<eos> The Orientals did that.<eos> Most of the paint I use is a liquid flowing kind of paint.<eos> The brushes I use are used more as sticks.<eos> The brush doesn't actually touch the canvas... but just above it.
Now?<eos> Their structure is no longer clearly defined.<eos> Once decomposition begins....<eos> You have an interesting acquaintance here.<eos> Take a look.<eos> In his condition, it's a miracle he was alive, not to mention the aneurysm.<eos> Inoperable.<eos> Would you like to remove the heart?<eos> If it's too much for you emotionally, as a woman....<eos> We save a human life and shortly afterwards it's lost all the same.
Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.<eos> The Green Destiny sword?<eos> You're giving it to Sir Te?<eos> I am.<eos> He has always been our greatest protector.<eos> I don't understand. How can you part with it?<eos> It has always been with you.<eos> Too many men have died at its edge.<eos> It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.<eos> You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.<eos> Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10. You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.<eos> But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!<eos> Everything fell apart.<eos> I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.<eos> Believe me,<eos> I've a lesson or two left to teach you!<eos> The sword is back...<eos> Are you happy?<eos> I admit... getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it.
A wonderful performance.<eos> My friends, ask yourselves... are we prepared to see our Empire... destroyed by a child?<eos> Then is now not the time we should act?<eos> Then down with the tyrants... and let the war begin!<eos> What is he doing?<eos> Isn't he going to use any spells?<eos> How did you do that?<eos> The Elven people do not require spells to work with magic.<eos> You use magic.<eos> We are part of it.
There is an Italian man standing at the marketplace, and he's prepared to pay 4 francs a tooth.<eos> I didn't check her mouth, but it could easily be worth a 100 francs.<eos> Well done, Eponine.<eos> You are just taking care of business like your father.<eos> Cosette will eat less bread too.<eos> - I would like to pull some teeth from her.<eos> No, I want to do that.<eos> I'm so sorry Madame.<eos> I wasn't able to find the well in the dark.<eos> I did find it, but there was so much mud in it.
Everyone's. We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.<eos> I said whose number do you need?<eos> You don't know 600 numbers by heart.<eos> Annabelle Daniels.<eos> Annabelle Daniels. 714-454-9346.<eos> Ten years old.<eos> Lived on the plume since birth.<eos> Wanted to be a synchronized swimmer, so she spent every minute in the pool.<eos> They detected a tumour in her brain.<eos> An operation shrunk it, with radiation after that.
Sometimes I think a man... understands a woman's motives better than her own sex does.<eos> Good Lord. I could've told Judy that.<eos> Oh, by the way, Miss Lily... I wish you'd try to persuade Judy to be civil to Rosedale.<eos> I did a neat stroke of business through him last week.<eos> If she'd only ask him to come and dine now and then... I'd get almost anything out of him.<eos> He's going to be richer than all of us one of these days.<eos> Would you do me a favour?<eos> A very great favour?<eos> I don't mean to bore you with all this... but I'm entirely dependent on my aunt... and though she's very kind, she gives me no regular allowance.<eos> I have a tiny income of my own but it's been badly invested.
- Jefferson, I can't!<eos> - I'll be right back!<eos> Get help, I'll be fine.<eos> Help me!<eos> She's in there, you got to get her out now!<eos> Stop!<eos> I have to save Karen!<eos> Lt's okay.<eos> Stop, please.<eos> The firemen stopped the fire from spreading throughout the entire dorm but the bathroom was gone and everything in it.
You don't seem very well.<eos> Who, me?<eos> Yes, you.<eos> Forget it. It's Depardieu.<eos> He crashed again?<eos> No, it's fake, it's for a film.<eos> A film you are shooting?<eos> Yes, yes, this very moment.<eos> - Where's the camera?<eos> - You can't see it. It's hidden.
With whom?<eos> With us.<eos> I'm sorry, I've been unwell,<eos> I haven't left my room and with this migraine, I did not watch TV.<eos> Well, I watched it, but it was off.<eos> Was it interesting?<eos> Not bad, not bad.<eos> As interesting as if it were on, for an old man like me,<eos> and who, therefore, has known a time in which TV was neither on nor off.<eos> That was, in my opinion, when it was most noticed... by its absence.
For chrissake, my son was kidnapped.<eos> Who was kidnapped?<eos> I wasn't kidnapped.<eos> These are my friends from school.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We all drove down here together.<eos> What?<eos> Then explain to me how the frigging car got blown to hell.<eos> Well, see...<eos> It was stolen.
It's not vulgar. It's a family car.<eos> -Why did you let him?<eos> Look, baby! Michel and Claire's new car.<eos> -You accepted it?<eos> -What could I do?<eos> -Refuse it!<eos> -I did. Don't blame me!<eos> Take it back if you want!<eos> But our car's fucked.<eos> Just the starter! It'll be fixed in three days.
Even if it discovers a pool, he loses.<eos> There's more?<eos> I do not need gold.<eos> I need a woman.<eos> Take that.<eos> - On exchange.<eos> - You do not part with.<eos> I dragged on for six months on this forsaken land.<eos> I started with two mules, a cart and luggage.<eos> - I no longer owns it.
You expect me to drive home in a new Jaguar?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - You're a freak! You are a freak.<eos> You want me to get in this car? No way!<eos> It'll probably blow up.<eos> That's real funny, bits and pieces of me raining down in the street!<eos> You think I'm going near that thing, you're nuts!<eos> Besides, I got a car.<eos> Sort of.<eos> What? You like it?
Okay, you got the money.<eos> Why do I have to come to the godfathers' table begging' every time?<eos> It's tough being' a star, isn't it?<eos> Soon this will be yours and you can do whatever you want.<eos> - When?<eos> Mr. Cropa, can I get you anything from the kitchen?<eos> No, Marti, not now.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Why don't you stick with the bookmaking, let me run this business?<eos> I've had this restaurant for longer than you've been alive, and I still have it, and it's my money.
Nice.<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> That was beautiful!<eos> Great shot!<eos> You kissed that like you kiss your mama.<eos> - Very Steve.<eos> - Soft and sweet.<eos> Can I borrow your truck for a few days?<eos> - What happened to your motorcycle?<eos> - It's got a broken infarculator.
"P.S.:<eos> Please can you care for the plants on the kitchen's balcony every 2. day?<eos> Especially the mint dries up quickly."<eos> Which one is the mint? Salvo!<eos> - Is this mint?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Hold it.<eos> - Papa, what are you doing...<eos> - It sure won't dry up now!<eos> Cut it out.
Yes... 8600 and then 8600 again.<eos> What?<eos> Expiry date?<eos> 09...<eos> Hallelujah!<eos> - Yeah...<eos> What a mess you're in!<eos> Jump in!<eos> Where's your car?<eos> - It was stolen!
Dude, where's my car?<eos> Where's your car, dude?<eos> Dude, where's my car?<eos> Where's your car, dude?<eos> -Did I drive last night?<eos> -Yeah, I think so.<eos> -Really?<eos> -I'm not sure.<eos> -Dude, where's your car?<eos> -Dude, it's not funny. It's gone.
Really?<eos> But I'll be alright.<eos> Makoto will watch over me, right Uncle Makoto?<eos> Mikiko, listen to your mother!<eos> They say it was the new teacher in town.<eos> You mean Takekawa's teacher.<eos> Really? !<eos> Good night.<eos> Hey Makoto, see that house?<eos> What about it?
What a fuss, so stubborn!<eos> It's a waste of water, but I'll do it.<eos> There, it won't fit.<eos> It's gone bad.<eos> No, it hasn't.<eos> You think I don't know when a battery's gone bad?<eos> Wake up, Osias.<eos> What do you mean, wake up?<eos> It's always worked fine... and I've had this radio since before you came here.<eos> And it's always worked fine.
Oh.<eos> Here you are, I won today.<eos> The bike can only carry one at a time!<eos> Huh?<eos> How are you?<eos> Welcome back.<eos> It's all tidied up.<eos> I really appreciate that.<eos> The sign is gone.<eos> Right, it's gone.
This "young and happy" man was awarded the Nobel prize in 1970.<eos> That's it.<eos> He became untouchable, no matter what they say.<eos> Thank God for that.<eos> Leave him in peace.<eos> Let him write.<eos> In his Nobel lecture he asked:<eos> "What can literature do against the onslaught of overt violence?<eos> Violence doesn't live alone, and can't live alone.<eos> It is inevitably interlaced with lies.
I no longer had the lively affinity I used to have.<eos> Not a single miniature was written there.<eos> Not a single one, during all my 20 years abroad.<eos> I did write them before I was banished, now I write them again.<eos> Not there.<eos> It's most strange.<eos> The same beautiful sky, the same clouds, the same light.<eos> Among other features of longevity, of old age -<eos> it is... it is a state that depends on... how you understand and expect death.<eos> That fear of death is so typical not only in the West, - all prosperous people feel it.
But there are thousands of them.<eos> We could put out some rat poison.<eos> Richie would eat it.<eos> We could send a cat down.<eos> A cat would fight with Richie.<eos> So what the fuck do we do?<eos> I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry.<eos> - Everything will be fine.<eos> - You're not in my position.<eos> Look at my leg, it'll be covered with scars.
Good<eos> You two dig the pit. Dasan will do the deed Let's not put it off.<eos> Let's move tonight. Agreed?<eos> Yes<eos> San. The hole's ready<eos> It's right here. We'll wait down there<eos> They've brought this over for you<eos> To help you over the shock<eos> Er Bozi's mother says don't worry about repaying the flour<eos> She says try and put it out of your head
We often allow gleaners to come in after our pickers provided they remain 1 0 yards behind.<eos> Look, there's still a lot left in the trees.<eos> We just take advantage of this.<eos> I collect them so that they don't go to waste, and I share them out, we stew them or whatever.<eos> I want to pick them because there're lots left as you can see.<eos> I don't take damaged ones, because my children are very particular.<eos> They're used to getting the best.<eos> This one is damaged so I chuck it away.<eos> We gleaners also discard some fruit.<eos> Here's an apple which has got nothing going for it, it's like an ugly and stupid woman.

We could be digging in on one side of a hedgerow and the Germans would be digging in on the other side of it.<eos> [Wood] There would be little openings with gates and stuff through them, and guys would have to attack through those damn things or over the top of one.<eos> [Hanks] The hedgerows, first planted in the Middle Ages, frustrated the war of movement, but not for long.<eos> [Wood] An ordnance sergeant figured out that he could weld two big prongs on the front of a tank, and they'd dig into the hedgerow, and the tank would shove its way through a hedgerow.<eos> After we got that, it made it a lot simpler.<eos> Some 60 years ago, an anonymous German bureaucrat poked his finger on a map and decreed that here, in this French farmer's fields, would be the site of these big coastal batteries.<eos> They're still there today, silent yet ominous reminders of the way in which war intrudes itself on ordinary human life.<eos> And yet that life has an amazing stubbornness.<eos> The guns may thunder, but the fields must still be harvested.<eos> The geese have to cross the road, even if it's choked with military traffic.
In Spain.<eos> You've been there?<eos> I've been everywhere.<eos> Like a witch doctor.<eos> Really?<eos> Why did you come back?<eos> To die.<eos> To die?<eos> First show him the butterfly room.<eos> Life is short and ends when you least expect it.
Don't scream.<eos> Be careful, will you?<eos> What's going on?<eos> -Who are you?<eos> -I'm the watchman.<eos> You all right, miss?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Beano, good girl....<eos> That beautiful beach is in South America.<eos> It's name is....
He rules in this town.<eos> So?<eos> If you work for him, you're all set.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> Who cares about Max?<eos> If you want to steal a car, you don't have to ask him.<eos> It's all organized, big business, not for amateurs.<eos> You know how many people make a living at it?<eos> A locksmith opens the car. He's a pro at codes and locks.<eos> A flunky drives it so it's no big deal if he gets caught.
I don't want to sound boastful, but with me it was girls galore !<eos> Guys, I know I told you a hundred times, but it's true !<eos> I'm in love !<eos> Her name's Dalia, she's gorgeous, she's nice, and smart and...<eos> Whom are you talking to ?<eos> No-one, get back to sleep.<eos> - lt's that pic again, isn't it ?<eos> - Just chatting with old friends.<eos> Do you take that photo everywhere ?<eos> I feel uncomfortable without it.
Let's go.<eos> And the fork?<eos> -Are you taking it?<eos> -Yes, I collect them.<eos> -There it is.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> Hi. A silver car, a convertible.<eos> -l'm sorry, I don't understand.<eos> -Convertible. A soft-top.<eos> It's just been taken.
- Ignore her.<eos> - What if he's asleep?<eos> - Asleep? Bullshit!<eos> Besides, he never opens the door, even if you ring.<eos> He's a dangerous lunatic.<eos> He'll leave the gas on someday and blow us up.<eos> - Hit it!<eos> - Ma'am!<eos> Don't touch my ax, damnit!<eos> It must be bolted.
And suddenly... I realized I was ageing, rapidly!<eos> Growing horribly old as I sat there!<eos> It was the movie... that was doing it, I had caught some kind of disease from the movie... and it was making... me grow old... bringing me closer and closer to death.<eos> I woke up terrified.<eos> And look at me now!<eos> Look where I am now!<eos> You see?<eos> The dream is coming true!<eos> I don't know how the kids figured out how to make that plunky old camera work. but you know, kids, Nothing fazes them.<eos> It bothered me. to have it in the house recording the moment. When you record the moment, you record the death of the moment.
Shit.<eos> Vaso.<eos> - Aren't you going to dress up? - Yes.<eos> The swelling's gone right down.<eos> I thought it was imperative to accept the prime minister's offer... and announce my candidacy.<eos> I shall seek the democratic vote... with the promise that at the end of the four-year term...<eos> Athens will be unrecognizable.<eos> It will be a new Athens.<eos> As mayor of all Athenians... I promise to clean up our city.<eos> It will be renovated, more beautiful and taller.
If you have the right name, We will find them.<eos> Come, there are others nearby.<eos> Searching for a family That is not yours?<eos> The Catholic Church does not believe To the reincarnation.<eos> Not.<eos> But that does not mean She does not believe in miracles.<eos> When things happen.<eos> Here's what I think.<eos> The soul does not die.<eos> I do not think It can be reborn, But it is possible, In rare circumstances, She speaks Through another.
Capt. Worsley recorded a fateful decision.<eos> The character of the pack has again changed.<eos> The floes are very thick.<eos> We cannot push through except with a very great expenditure of power.<eos> We therefore prefer to lie to for a while to see if the pack opens at all when this northeast wind clears.<eos> When day broke, the men found the ice had closed around the ship.<eos> No water was visible in any direction.<eos> As the days passed, the ice showed no sign of relenting.<eos> The event that sealed their fate was recalled years later in a radio interview by expedition meteorologist Leonard Hussey.<eos> On the 1 4 of February, 1 91 5, the temperature suddenly dropped from 20 degrees above zero to 20 degrees below and the whole sea froze over and we froze in with it.
Want some chai?<eos> Great place you've got here...<eos> Tell me, you think...<eos> Your Babba will mind me staying here a while?<eos> And what about Renanna?<eos> It's already happened, right?<eos> When was the last time someone rode this bike?<eos> - What?<eos> This bike!<eos> How long wasn't it used?
You really care about Miss Sakuya<eos> Miss Sakuya is a girl I'm just concerned for her safety<eos> I'm sending 2 ninjas to escort her<eos> This is Hyoeh Mashiragi<eos> This is Shuzo Nigarasu<eos> They are each master ninjas, they will be an enormous help to you<eos> An excellent arrangement<eos> When do you plan to leave?<eos> Vortex has inexhaustible power<eos> Each time it's drawn for its sheath, a demon must be killed as a sacrifice to the sword
Potatoes<eos> People – it's very hard for them to hungry.<eos> People in Bougainville alone they survive.<eos> That's why we say we can't depend on other people.<eos> We got a blessing.<eos> Gardens from here, it's no end. And you've got bush from the river up to another mountain.<eos> As you see, all the whole green.<eos> It's all over – that's Bougainville.<eos> Yet no plant from Bougainville comes close to the importance of the coconut.<eos> We know we've been fed and sheltered by it, but then Ishmael shows us what a perfectly packaged life-support system it is and how his people have learned to make use of every part of it.
By this time, he was bleeding, hopping madly down the hall, she giving chase all the while, thumping him with his own prosthetic.<eos> He went crashing down the stairs, and that was the end of him.<eos> Then, she just dropped the murder weapon and ... excuse me, the thumping device,and ran off.<eos> He just lay there, one leg twitching, the other evidence.<eos> You said "swinging wildly."<eos> So, you would say that she had a wild reaction,<eos> - would you say that?<eos> - Well, it certainly wasn't subtle.<eos> As a lay person, how would you describe Mrs. Mills' behavior?<eos> I'd describe it as murderous.
And it hurts.<eos> LAWYER: And I'll remind the court just one last time:<eos> This was a mission of mercy.<eos> Dr. Barrett acted to spare a patient intense suffering.<eos> The only reason we're all here is because he didn't play games with some Kevorkian machine that would have allowed us all to wink and circumvent the law.<eos> JUDGE: I understand that, counsel.<eos> But by not allowing us to wink, he has left me with no choice.<eos> Dr. Barrett, would you stand, please?<eos> As the judge who sat on your trial I must say I have a deep admiration for you.<eos> And compassion though I doubt it would rise up to the level of yours.
Then why did we go through all this?<eos> Because you wouldn't have believed it.<eos> You would have regarded it as a self-serving ploy to get money.<eos> I did love you.<eos> And I wanted to live with you forever.<eos> But you rejected the terms we married on, you pushed me away.<eos> Because I wanted to be touched.<eos> I wanted a little passion.<eos> That wasn't the basis of our relationship.<eos> And there may have been fraud here but I didn't commit it.
You're not wrong for wanting to meet and f all in love with Mr. Penis Head.<eos> You have to forgive our minister.<eos> We just did a recent survey and seventy percent of our single congregants join church to meet somebody.<eos> He's frustrated.<eos> Well, it's a lonely world, Lisa.<eos> I thought you were over Billy.<eos> I was.<eos> I am.<eos> He was still maybe my best friend and the only childhood friend that I kept.<eos> And and as I see my youth slipping away and losing the one connection I had to it, I
Oh, my God<eos> - Julie!<eos> Be on the lookout for things that make you laugh.<eos> If you see nothing worth laughing at, pretend you see it, then laugh.<eos> Oi!<eos> Hairy!<eos> What you lookin' at?<eos> Have you ever noticed a calm person with a loud voice?<eos> Try and speak softly once in a while.<eos> Add a dab of lavender to milk, leave town with an orange and pretend you're laughing at it.
- There's someone I want you to meet.<eos> Um,this is Riley Finn.<eos> - My boyfriend.<eos> - Very nice to meet you, Mr Giles.<eos> Did you help plan this? It was quite a surprise.<eos> The first of many.<eos> Um... - Been dating long?<eos> - Giles was the librarian at my high school.<eos> Ah. I've seen the library.<eos> It's gone downhill since you left.
No.<eos> There is one peroxided pest whose number's up.<eos> I'm gonna rip Spike's head off.<eos> I'm gonna...<eos> Bathe in the Slayer's blood.<eos> I'm gonna dive in it.<eos> Swim in it.<eos> I'm gonna do the bloody backstroke.<eos> I see it, Spikey! I see the chip!<eos> It's nestled like a pretty Easter egg with your brain around it, like that plastic grassy stuff...
Down on your knees!<eos> Hold still.<eos> Hey, look at the bag.<eos> It's not even leather.<eos> I can think of about two million reasons, Tiger.<eos> Hello.<eos> Can I help you folks?<eos> We're with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.<eos> We'd like to talk to you about your car.<eos> We believe it may have been involved in a traffic collision earlier this evening.
- She's in there.<eos> - She?<eos> We were just sort of standing here, talking, and suddenly she started shooting up the place.<eos> A hit woman, we think.<eos> Who obviously wanted us dead.<eos> We were on her list.<eos> And that's why you're standing here alive, and she's in here riddled with bullets?<eos> Darryl, it was self-defence.<eos> You can check her gun if you don't believe us.<eos> The only fingerprints that you're gonna find on it are hers.
Hear it?<eos> - Is that what I think it is?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's a Bailey.<eos> What's wrong? Vertigo?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It's normal for a first-timer.<eos> A little fire from a Bailey ought to clear your head.<eos> Probably take it right off actually.
- Oh, my God!<eos> - It's Jay and Silly Bob!<eos> - That's Silent Bob.<eos> - And NBA great, Charles Barkley!<eos> - Hey, kids. I thought we told you to get out of here!<eos> Now that he's gone, how would you kids like to learn a magic trick?<eos> Yea!<eos> Watch what happens when we take an ordinary quarter, cover it with this glass and a handkerchief, and say the magic words.<eos> - Alika-nooch!<eos> - It's gone!
She worked hard all her life to give that to me!<eos> I'm sorry you walked in on that. No.<eos> Don't, please.<eos> -Goodbye.<eos> -No, please, I'm begging you.<eos> -Just stay here.<eos> -l can't stay here.<eos> No, trust me.<eos> That fucking brooch better not be missing.<eos> It's gone, you fucking, motherfucking....
I'm supposed to be a revved-up girl.<eos> Truth is, I'm a lemon.<eos> I don't know about that.<eos> What can I do?<eos> Stay with me.<eos> Please?<eos> I'm right here.<eos> You won't leave?<eos> I'm not goin' anywhere.<eos> I put the money in an envelope, I put the envelope in this box, and now it's gone.
You want me inside ya?<eos> Peter, look at this one.<eos> It's safe and reliable and we can afford it.<eos> I'll just see if I can find a salesman.<eos> Hey, I'm Doug, nice to meet ya.<eos> Whoa, have you lost weight?<eos> It's still there. I'm parting it on the side.<eos> We were more interested in that car over there.<eos> - Lois, let me handle this.<eos> - Peter, this car has dents in it. And it's got a cardboard steering wheel.
Away! - ...<eos> I warned you.<eos> Pilot, - what the hell's happened to you?<eos> - Nothing's happening to me.<eos> - Can you see the light?<eos> - What are you talking about? The pulsar light.<eos> Does it physically come in here?<eos> No, my readings of it are registered on Moya's database.<eos> So you can't actually see the light.<eos> So WHY are you being affected by it?
It's about you and the Hynerian.<eos> You will not call any more witnesses<eos> You will not pursue the line of questioning you began today.<eos> If you do, you and the little slug will find yourself up on charges.<eos> False charges.<eos> That will, nevertheless, keep you locked up here in Litigara for the rest of your lives<eos> You see, this is all about Utilities rights, my dear.<eos> Utilities don't need any more rights.<eos> They need to work harder.<eos> That's my concern Your concern is your own life And where you're going to spend the rest of it.
Well you handled me- self well, too.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Ah, I just can't stop thinking about Crichton'll never see his daughter again.<eos> Hits pretty close to home, huh?<eos> The fact that I may never see my son again is a grief I would wish upon no one.<eos> Pains me to think of what he's going through right now.<eos> Pains me too.<eos> And you thought we weren't compatible.<eos> Zhaan said the surgical reconstructors did an excellent job on your leg.<eos> There's no sign that it was ever broken.
I like that dress.<eos> How come you're not eating?<eos> This tuna salad smells like Gordon.<eos> Yeah, Cindy smells, too.<eos> Like flowers.<eos> Did she say anything about me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Her tongue was in my ear the whole time.<eos> Shut up!<eos> I'm gonna have to get Cindy to come and kiss it and make it all better.
- May you bounce in peace.<eos> - Get the hell off my planet!<eos> Well, that's it.<eos> Let's reactivate him.<eos> Wake up!<eos> Chumps and chumpettes!<eos> Is the bomb out?<eos> - Can I say the word I love to say?<eos> - Sorry, we couldn't remove it.<eos> It's stuck in there with glue or something.
- I found it.<eos> - You found the frog.<eos> - It was a turtle, not a frog.<eos> - It says here it's a frog.<eos> - It's a turtle.<eos> - Really?<eos> Trust me.<eos> Listen, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to cancel that DSL order.<eos> Sure?<eos> It's already paid for.
Lunch break.<eos> Abandon ship.<eos> - Am I interrupting?<eos> - No, ma'am.<eos> If you have some time later, sir, I'd really appreciate it.<eos> I'm sure she would.<eos> - Would what?<eos> - Appreciate it.<eos> Oh, I've seen this play before.<eos> It's called The Actress and the Director.
[Laughs] But, seriously, uh, Marty?<eos> Marty, Marty, Marty.<eos> Uh, unfortunately, my husband's union went on strike today, so we're gonna have to return it because the payments are a bit too much for us right now.<eos> Got the receipt right here, so, is there a cashier's window I go to?<eos> What? No, I... No.<eos> I couldn't possibly take the car back now. Once those tires hit the pavement, it depreciates big time.<eos> Is, uh, Danny aiello still interested, or...<eos> Mmm, no.<eos> Oh, come on. Come on. Be--be reasonable here.<eos> I mean, it's only got 18 Miles on it.
A pure supply is one thing... but to cut it...!<eos> - What can we do?<eos> - I'm thinking.<eos> - Half of Royston Vasey had it!<eos> - We're all at risk.<eos> Not quite all of us.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> It's like I've always said, Samuel.<eos> I'm a businessman.<eos> I've a shelf full of black pudding out there, but I don't care for it.
We're not going to find anything interesting.<eos> I take that back.<eos> Look, the circus!<eos> The circus is at our house!<eos> Say good-bye for a few days, boys. We're moving out.<eos> This is humiliating.<eos> Why can't we just stay at a nice hotel?<eos> Because we're giving all our money to the exterminators so they can stay in nice hotels.<eos> Craig... thank you so much for lending us your trailer.<eos> Oh, I'm just glad someone's finally getting some use out of it.
Come on.<eos> You wanna know, don't you?<eos> You want all the answers.<eos> I can give them to you, but first you have to convince them... that I'm not your enemy.<eos> Max didn't tell you about this, did he? Take it.<eos> It'll prove to them that I don't want to hurt you.<eos> If you convince them, then I can explain everything.<eos> How could you bring them up here like this?<eos> You know the special unit is close. You saw that camera.<eos> Who do you think put it on them in the first place?
God, I missed you.<eos> You gotta go see the girls more often.<eos> Come on.<eos> Suddenly I felt safe again.<eos> It had all just been a bad dream.<eos> As long as I was near Aidan, it would all be OK.<eos> Until the morning.<eos> Why do you have to go to Pennsylvania today?<eos> See that chair?<eos> It's got owners that miss it very much.
No sheets. - Fuck the sheets.<eos> You're bent over, and I'm playing with you.<eos> - Your dick is in my mouth.<eos> - Jesus, I'm gonna come.<eos> The next night, Miranda was going to third with George when her second line beeped.<eos> Dammit, hold on.<eos> - Trey says his mom won't negotiate.<eos> - Hold on. - Are you OK?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Your dick is in my mouth. Keep it there.
Thank you, II Duce.<eos> Got something to say, "the little girl who might want to use one of those cars in the next 100 years"?<eos> It's my fault, Med.<eos> I was insensitive to his feelings.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You see that?<eos> See how easy that was?<eos> So, Mr. Delegated Power of Attorney have you given it any thought?<eos> Can my girlfriend have the listing? To the house?<eos> As long as it gets sold I don't give a fuck who lists it.
For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we ...will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday.<eos> That is our presentation.<eos> An idea that we call...<eos> "Hate Crime Laws:<eos> A Savage Hypocracy."<eos> That made the most sense of any presentation I've heard in the last three years.<eos> Hurry up!<eos> They're sending the dogs after us!<eos> What's the matter?<eos> It's my leg! I think it's broken.
The geological disturbances that Voyager seems to be causing.<eos> The probe recorded half a dozen each month.<eos> Still no way to tell how severe they are.<eos> Look at the amount of iron being used in that city.<eos> That's ten times what you'd expect to see in a culture at this stage of development.<eos> Do you think they're using it to support their buildings?<eos> If you lived on a planet that wouldn't stop shaking, you might be doing the same thing.<eos> If they've reached this stage of industrial development, they must be observing us.<eos> The probe's impulse thrusters are starting to fail.<eos> At its present altitude, it's been operating for over 200 years.
But I haven't even started the diagnostic.<eos> Then what were you doing?<eos> Nothing. I just got here.<eos> I know that wasn't my fault.<eos> These gel-packs aren't burned out.<eos> There's no trace of any EM discharge.<eos> Could it have dissipated this quickly? No, it moved.<eos> Moved?<eos> The discharge seems to be traveling through the bio-neural circuitry... jumping from system to system.<eos> Can you isolate it?
is somebody out there?<eos> Tom, if that's you, this isn't funny.<eos> Stay away!<eos> Calm yourself, Mr. Neelix.<eos> Y-you really shouldn't sneak up on people like that.<eos> I could have shot you.<eos> Your restraint is commendable.<eos> is there a problem with the air supply?<eos> An alien life-form has seized control of Voyager's primary systems.<eos> It's flooded numerous sections with poisonous gas.
l-l-l'm flattered, really, but if you don't leave now, I'll have to call Security.<eos> I'll bet you can calculate pi to over a thousand digits.<eos> Security to Sick Bay. Have you ever balanced simultaneous equations?<eos> Computer, deactivate Emergency Medical Hologram.<eos> Here you are.<eos> I needed to find some peace and quiet.<eos> I want to show you something.<eos> What's this?<eos> You inspired me to create my own musical composition.<eos> It's based on the intersection of two fractals.
Come in. - Yeah, go ahead, Major.<eos> - Reinforcements are on the way, sir.<eos> Take your time.<eos> We're secure. Good to hear it, sir.<eos> Uh, sir, the Stargate just came on.<eos> There's a strange bright light headed this way.<eos> Do not engage. Repeat:<eos> get out of the way and do not engage. In fact, I'm ordering you all to put down your weapons until that light is gone.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> It's gone, sir.
The ship is fully automated.<eos> The beings that built it are called the Gad-Meer.<eos> Not exactly ET. They placed all of their knowledge within the ship's memory.<eos> Science, mathematics, medicine, art, philosophy... Ten thousand years of civilisation. This is their legacy.<eos> They were a very advanced race compared to the Enkarans. However, they were also... peaceful,... ..and fell victim to a superior military power.<eos> So they built this ship in the hopes that their world would be born again,... ..far from the reach of their enemies. This is, uh, this is fascinating. I'd love a chance to study some of that.<eos> I can provide you with translations. Your language is simple by comparison. Excuse me.<eos> About why we're here?<eos> The ship has only enough raw material to transform one planet.<eos> Now the transformation has been started, it must be finished here,... ..or the entire Gad-Meer civilisation will be lost for ever.
Really?<eos> - Yes. This is not how it should sound. - (noise stops)<eos> - How so? - It seems the design of your ears,... ..my ears, is not meant for it. Um...<eos> To be honest with you, I'm here to see if you'll consider alternate solutions... ..to the problem faced by the Enkarans. I am not programmed to solve the problem faced by the Enkarans.<eos> Right.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> What will happen to you when this is all over? I will be reintegrated into the ship's systems.<eos> You mean you'll die? Yes, I suppose that is one interpretation.<eos> - Do you wanna die?<eos> - What I want is irrelevant. Wouldn't you like to experience... ..what it's like to be an Enkaran before you're reintegrated? See some of the planet before it's completely transformed, and...
The core temperature was too warm, the size was too large,... ..and there were intelligent life forms already present.<eos> Intelligent life forms? Based on the description, I believe they were Enkaran. So, what shall we do now?<eos> - What is it?<eos> - It's OK. Don't, uh... don't be afraid. What's goin' on?<eos> Lotan would like to offer you a compromise.<eos> The ship has expended too many of the resources needed... ..for the transformation process to begin again on another planet.<eos> I require that you give up this world.<eos> How is that a compromise? We found the original Enkaran home world. - What?<eos> - How? It was one of several million planets scanned by the ship before this one.<eos> It was rejected partly because of the presence of intelligent life forms.
(Eurondans gasp) In return we can teach your people how to construct weapons systems such as ours.<eos> Aero-fighters, stasis devices, fusion reactors... Sounds fair. Carter?<eos> - Medicine, sir.<eos> - Oh, right.<eos> We were very impressed with that beta-caro... candy stuff. Beta-cantin. Of course.<eos> - Jack?<eos> - Daniel.<eos> Shouldn't we ask what the heavy water is for?<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> - The power generated by it... ..would be used to reinforce our defences, Dr Jackson.
I am not defending him, Daniel. I agree with him.<eos> Don't you realise what we'd be doing?<eos> Doctor? Sir, Colonel O'Neill has negotiated access to every advanced Eurondan technology... ..in exchange for an unknown quantity of heavy water.<eos> - That's all they want?<eos> - That's all.<eos> - What do they want it for?<eos> - Thank you for asking the question.<eos> - Heavy water contains deuterium.<eos> - Which can be used in nuclear weapons.<eos> Yes, but they use it to fuel nuclear fusion generators. Fusion? Alar says the additional power would be enough to stave off defeat.
- You're sure? - About what?<eos> You said he nominated them both even though he was under no legal obligation to do so.<eos> - You'll fix it at the briefing?<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> The AMA says addiction is a disease.<eos> You're not gonna be able to sell that.<eos> - Why does he have to sell it?<eos> - Because.<eos> Drug addiction is a medical problem.<eos> It can be treated.
Follow me.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Tom and I had a professor at Duke who couldn't stand me.<eos> "Those may be your thoughts, Mr. Seaborn, but that's not the law. "<eos> I wanted to tell him to take the law and shove it up...<eos> - You ever been in the White House? - No.<eos> - We were looking forward to a tour.<eos> - That's my office over there the president works in that round room there and no one else matters.<eos> - This is the Mural Room.<eos> - Can you tell us anything about it?
Excuse me?<eos> The moment you stepped foot here, you're marked now.<eos> You know that?<eos> Sir, I'm here to protect you.<eos> And how are you gonna do that?<eos> You thought of everything, except that.<eos> Well, this thing, Mr Stefaniuk, is still flesh and blood.<eos> It can be killed.<eos> You think it'll just walk through the door?<eos> It's waited 44 years. lt'll wait out there as long as it takes, until you can't stand it any more.
Which one's which?<eos> Mulder, I think that professional jealousy... is as good a motive for murder as any.<eos> If it was a murder.<eos> I'm not convinced.<eos> If I can get Mr. Maleeni into an autopsy bay, hopefully we can put this issue to rest as soon as possible.<eos> All right, I'm stumped.<eos> I think I'm supposed to be.<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - Well, first of all, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but Mr. Maleeni's head... didn't just magically fall off.<eos> It was very carefully sawed.
Skinner says that you're around the clock on this.<eos> You need to get your rest.<eos> I grabbed a few winks.<eos> I asked him to contact some friends of Mulder's. I think they'll be able to help.<eos> - l'd appreciate all the help I can get.<eos> - Doggett, you're a good agent.<eos> Trust your instincts.<eos> The drug that Bormanis was cooking up was some kind of a superamphetamine.<eos> Legal or not, no one's ever seen it before.<eos> You think it was intended for Tipet?
If she's helping Hercules, she could lead him t... No.<eos> No, she wouldn't dare.<eos> She's a woman!<eos> Whatever you're thinking, you're probably right.<eos> Then I shall rid the world of Xena and Hercules myself.<eos> Yeah, you go do that..., ...Dad.<eos> Why are we stopping?<eos> That mortal blood really limits your vision, doesn't it?<eos> The dagger's inside.<eos> It's power allows you to kill the proxidicae.
-It's me, sweetheart.<eos> -When are you coming home?<eos> Soon, sweetheart. I promise.<eos> You won't even know I'm gone.<eos> Go on now.<eos> Gabrielle... Ok...<eos> Let's go home.<eos> -Stop! -Ok.<eos> Xena...<eos> The birth of Xena's baby approaches bringing with it the death of the gods.
Hasn't there been enough blood here already?<eos> We have an obligation to Yakut, the tribe.<eos> We have an obligation here.<eos> Without new life, our tribe dies.<eos> Begin the right of caste ceremony.<eos> I don't think we're gonna find what we're looking for here.<eos> Even as a spirit, I don't have the ability to break the laws of time..., ...to see into the past.<eos> Then we'll have to bring the past to us.<eos> The Atmah dagger.<eos> But it was banished to the netherworld long ago so it wouldn't fall into the wrong hands.
Why don't you come along?<eos> It's not every day you get to witness the twilight of the gods.<eos> It should be a good show.<eos> Your precious Eli is dead.<eos> So is his crusade.<eos> No!<eos> His spirit lives on in all of us!<eos> Eli!<eos> Eli!<eos> I'm glad to see your faith is strong because you're gonna die with it.
Well, then you'll love this next float.<eos> It's an all-gingerbread desk set.<eos> Ho, ho, ho! Merry everyone!<eos> Ahoy hoy, St. Nick.<eos> "Pranksgiving?" Uh-oh.<eos> Prepare to be boarded.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I told you.<eos> I'm not your monkey anymore.<eos> Silence, monkey. Now that you're Father Christmas... we have an opportunity to bend this town over our knee... and give it a pranking it will never forget.
Those balloons won't biodegrade for 1 0,000 years.<eos> If Bart gets a wollypop, I want a wollypop. Ah, Maggie wants a balloon.<eos> And Daddy will take a hand stamp so he can get back in.<eos> - [ Groans ] -Just kidding.<eos> Remember my face.<eos> [ Groans ]<eos> Moe, the new Duff calendars are out- the ones with your picture!<eos> Oh, boy!<eos> Move over liquor license.<eos> Hey, Moe, this license expired in 1 973... and it's only good in Rhode Island, and it's signed by you.
I can't believe the money these humps get to do this.<eos> Go go go.<eos> And that's actually funny, because it turns out that the new wallpaper doesn't exactly match.<eos> So, it might cost more money to fix it.<eos> Cost who more?<eos> Um, we were thinking... you.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm not going to pay anything.<eos> The wallpaper's fine.<eos> I want it the same!
Some smoked sausage, Mother?<eos> Black pudding.<eos> Joana?<eos> - Would you like ice-cream?<eos> - No way!<eos> Who knows if we are not on the brink of a new era?<eos> For a long time we put up with the era of abandonment.<eos> Perhaps we are entering the era of hospitality<eos> With the recrudescence of Fascism snapping at us?<eos> It's gone out..
We can't get in. The bulkhead took a hit, and the door's wedged tight.<eos> Hiko's cuttin' it now.<eos> Jesus Christ, the barge!<eos> - We gotta cut that damn thing loose!<eos> - That's not an option, Mr. Baker.<eos> Skipper, should I head for the breach?<eos> I need an answer now.<eos> - Winds 125, Captain!<eos> - Captain, take a look!<eos> That barge goes down, we go down with it!
It took you 22 San Miguels to realize that?<eos> Really nice guys, huh?<eos> Viable choices.<eos> - Can I cut in?<eos> How come Mom and Dad like each other so much?<eos> It's hard to take, but it would be really- lt would be really nice to have.<eos> For those of us who don't already have it.<eos> - Where's Marco?<eos> - He went to pick up Buckley's dress.<eos> It's been on standby since the family Picassos went up for auction.
Malkovich.<eos> - How was it?<eos> - It was amazing this time.<eos> - That was no simulation! - I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's an honor.<eos> I have been to the dark side. I've seen a world that no man should see!<eos> Really?<eos> For most people, it's a rather pleasant experience.<eos> That portal is mine, and it must be sealed forever for the love of God.
She's fine.<eos> What did she say about your father?<eos> She went to see him. He's the same.<eos> Doctors think it's permanent.<eos> How can they say that?<eos> The nursing home said if he didn't improve in six months, he never would.<eos> They may be wrong. They know little about mental illness.<eos> -All is ready, effendi.<eos> You want to see the tomb one last time?<eos> I'll be happier when it's sealed.
I won't have my throat cut by no lunatic... ... notforallthe relicsinEgypt !<eos> Take care there. You'll have me in too. Be careful.<eos> It's hopeless.<eos> Parts of this bog are bottomless.<eos> We'll never find it.<eos> Now for some particulars, if you don't mind.<eos> What was on the cart?<eos> A ruddy box.<eos> We was taking it to the house up the ways.<eos> -What was in it? -l don't know.
-Not to those who believed in him.<eos> -Perhaps not.<eos> Their standard of intelligence must have been low.<eos> -Why do you say that?<eos> -He was insignificant.<eos> He had nothing to commend him to anyone intelligent.<eos> -You assume a great deal.<eos> -l don't think so.<eos> I've studied extensively this so-called religion.<eos> It's based upon artificial, ludicrous beliefs.
But first things first.<eos> Father Godwin... take the Princess Morgana to the chapel... that she may meditate before making a final decision.<eos> Yes, sire.<eos> Gentlemen, let us proceed to the kennels.<eos> The royal pets are hungry.<eos> Take him.<eos> That stone, my lady... where did you get it?<eos> Eric gave it to me.<eos> Where did he get it?<eos> He said it was tied around his neck... when the Vikings captured him as a baby.
Look for thy reward... among the nettles at the elder tree which overshades the mouth of that same pit where we decreed to bury Bassianus.<eos> Do this and purchase us thy lasting friends."<eos> O Tamora! Was ever heard the like?<eos> This is the pit and this the elder tree.<eos> Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out that should have murdered Bassianus here.<eos> My gracious Lord... here is the bag of gold.<eos> Two of thy whelps, fell curs of bloody kind, have here bereft my brother of his life!<eos> Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison. There let them bide until we have devised some never-heard-of torturing pain for them.<eos> High Emperor, upon my feeble knee I beg this boon with tears not lightly shed that this fell fault of my accursed sons... accursed, if the fault be proved in them-<eos> If it be proved?
- What ten?<eos> Look, look here, Lester.<eos> Where did you find my fingerprints, I can tell you right now I cleaned all those guns last night, so there on all of them.<eos> Anybody see you clean them?<eos> I did.<eos> - You did not!<eos> Why would I smash a gun case that doesn't even lock?<eos> The latch doesn't even work. - He's right.<eos> It hangs there.<eos> I seen it a million times. - I've been meaning to fix it.
The junkyard. Of course!<eos> Food for the metaI-eater.<eos> I wouldn't worry about this.<eos> It isn't really happening.<eos> This is only a bad dream.<eos> Where's the giant?<eos> This is only a bad dream.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> This thing is real, sir.<eos> I not only have incontrovertible evidence, I know where it's hidden.
Jeez!<eos> What's your problem?<eos> - What?<eos> - Did you change course?<eos> No, I didn't change course.<eos> I just boosted the power.<eos> Why dog it?<eos> We can be at the beacon in, like, under an hour.<eos> That beacon is marking a gravity well.<eos> One cubic inch of it... exerts more gravitational force than the sun.
Warning...<eos> gravitational anomaly detected.<eos> Bane to sailors and monster of myth.<eos> What's a Scylla?<eos> Ulysses sailed between the whirlpool Charybdis... and the island monster, Scylla.<eos> She snatched six of his men and ate them.<eos> Whoa.<eos> What is this thing?<eos> This thing is a distortion in space-time.<eos> The Pilgrims were the first to chart it.

Wait a minute. Wait.<eos> I believe in my powers.<eos> "I believe in my powers."<eos> I believe in the powers of my teammates.<eos> "I believe in the powers of my teammates."<eos> I trust in my powers.<eos> "I trust in my powers."<eos> I trust in the powers of my teammates.<eos> "I trust in the powers of my teammates."<eos> This team must learn to work together or mark my words it will be torn apart!
Is that it?<eos> What do you mean is that it?<eos> I'm telling you something I thought you'd have a response to.<eos> Sorry, is that not enough?<eos> OK. I'll go.<eos> Why haven't you finished your sculpture?<eos> Where did that come from?<eos> I'm there every day and.<eos> I, um, think it's perfect, it's beautiful.<eos> You said you didn't like it and it wasn't finished. You said it like you never would.
Now.<eos> Hold on, Morpheus.<eos> They're coming for you.<eos> They're coming.<eos> Can you hear me, Morpheus?<eos> I'm going to be honest with you.<eos> I hate this place this zoo this prison this reality, whatever you want to call it.<eos> I can't stand it any longer.<eos> It's the smell. If there is such a thing.<eos> I feel saturated by it.
Was it? - Did you speak to Tom?<eos> - November 7 is my information.<eos> I don't remember the exact date.<eos> - When did you last see Signor Ripley?<eos> - A few days ago.<eos> Here is a pattern.<eos> Two days ago, Freddie Miles is dead, hmm?<eos> He leaves your apartment, and he's murdered.<eos> Yesterday, a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks.<eos> And the owner tells the police it was stolen on November 7.
Yeah. Well, maybe you could read it to us just the same.<eos> Read us this letter, Dutchy.<eos> That's someone else's letter.<eos> Was.<eos> I wanna hear you read it.<eos> I don't think I care to.<eos> Oh, is that so?<eos> Well, I think that if you think a little bit more, Dutchy... you'll think you do wanna read it me.<eos> Right now too.<eos> How do we know there might be secrets in it?
I'll fuck your brains out.<eos> What makes you think I'll go for it?<eos> That's a 1956 Jaguar Roadster.<eos> Because I'm the only person you can't have, and it kills you.<eos> No way.<eos> You can put it anywhere.<eos> You got yourself a bet, baby.<eos> Happy hunting, Sebastian.<eos> Your home is beautiful, Mrs. Rosemond.<eos> It's been in my family for over 100 years.
I hope you enjoyed your stay with us.<eos> Mr.Fuller, nice having you here.<eos> Your usual table?<eos> No, thanks, Gene.<eos> Her name is Erika.<eos> She's from Toledo.<eos> Ashton, would you do me a favor?<eos> You'd like to meet her?<eos> I want you to keep this letter.<eos> Somebody will ask for it. A man named Douglas Hall.
I have had a dream past the wit of man to say what dream it was.<eos> Man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream.<eos> Methought I was....<eos> There is no man can tell what.<eos> Methought I was....<eos> And methought I had....<eos> But man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought I had.<eos> The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive nor his heart to report, what my dream was.<eos> I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream.<eos> It shall be called "Bottom's Dream."
- What are you looking for?<eos> - My pocket watch is not in here.<eos> - If you put it in, it's in there. - No, it isn't.<eos> There's no watch in here.<eos> Look, it's gone.<eos> - Then it was never in there.<eos> - What do you mean? I put it in. - It was in there.<eos> - Are you saying we stole your watch?<eos> I'm saying the watch I inherited from my great-grandfather is gone. I put it in this sack. It's not in there now.<eos> Would you please go into the back and see if it's fallen out?
it hasn't always been easy.<eos> What are you looking at, Nana?<eos> The light.<eos> It keeps changing.<eos> What do you want to do with your life?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I have to report to the police once a week.<eos> Difficult.<eos> We should try and find the recipe.<eos> It's still hidden in this house somewhere.
Cheney will have your badge for that.<eos> He wouldn't give me a voucher.<eos> What could I do?<eos> You could take it back to him.<eos> The man is a living monument to ineptitude.<eos> True.<eos> Let's take a look.<eos> What do you got there?<eos> Third piece of the puzzle.<eos> There's something really strange about it, though.
The nightingale sings in the forests...<eos> A fire breaks out... I don't care A snake bites me...<eos> But I'd never be able to bear the pain of my broken-heart<eos> Come now, my beloved<eos> Do come now, my beloved<eos> The heart sees no reason<eos> Every moment passes by... but the heartache remains Even if he has forgotten everything, I do remember so much<eos> The plant that the vines engulf, withers away<eos> Where it hoped for roses...<eos> it is left with thorns
Real bad thing.<eos> I've been buying The Post and The Daily News all week.<eos> It would be nice to see some money.<eos> You got some balls.<eos> You should be paying us to stand here.<eos> - I've spent a lot of money.<eos> - Come on. Shut the fuck up.<eos> Listen to this.<eos> "Although police officials declined to discuss the note,<eos> "our unofficial source said it was written by a homicidal maniac,
And given you seven kids as well.<eos> And I will tell you this for nothing,<eos> I am not gonna watch you crush them one by one because of your pig bloody ignorance!<eos> - You bastard bitch!<eos> - You bugger!<eos> - No! - You call me pig, bitch!<eos> You talk to me like this again, I'll kill you, bloody bitch!<eos> I burn your bastard family when you sleep!<eos> 'This cloudy planet is the Earth, our home.<eos> 'We know it's crowded with people and life 'and things going on.
For what?<eos> He needs a place to think about his character, alone.<eos> You only had one line.<eos> Derrick, check it out.<eos> Oh, yeah. My dad made me invite him.<eos> Happy birthday, Derrick.<eos> Is there somethin' you want to see in there?<eos> We're gonna put on a pretend play.<eos> - Wanna be in it?<eos> - Okay. It's called "Locked in the Dungeon."
"Oooh, all night, all night."<eos> Oh, yummy, give it up for Maggie, from 1 0 Percent Books. Making her lip-synching debut here tonight at The Cat's Ass.<eos> And remember, girls, she is s-s-single.<eos> - Ten Percent Books.<eos> - Honey...?<eos> - Ten Percent...<eos> - Margaret?<eos> Mom?<eos> You know, I've just had this... terrible letter from the university.<eos> It was addressed to you, so I opened it... and it's confirmation of your withdrawal from school.
Nestled deep within my mother's womb, soft as rabbit's fur,<eos> I feel the warm caress of her breathing, hear the beating of her heart.<eos> And I begin to get to know her.<eos> What's his name?<eos> - He didn't say.<eos> If I'd made it to the theatre, I would have seen him.<eos> Papa bought me a new dress.<eos> It was white and flowing.<eos> As if he'd known that I was going to meet him.<eos> Why aren't you wearing it then?
Take my word.<eos> Yes, good evening.<eos> From Bilbao? But... your wife?<eos> - Coffee for everyone?<eos> - Liters of it. It's the only way to put up with people's hassles.<eos> Can I have your autograph?<eos> It's you, isn't it?<eos> Come on, don't be shy.<eos> I never judge people, and I never forget a voice.<eos> I hear a voice and I've got it for good.
- I'll be right out.<eos> - It's Felix!<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> I'm sure of it. Please, don't let him find me.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> I'm Javier Orilla.<eos> Inspector Feijo, from Homicide.<eos> I'd like a word with you to check out some information.<eos> Is the meeting room free?<eos> I'm sorry, it's being used right now.
- I never heard this station before.<eos> - Kind of funky.<eos> You like that?<eos> Last night these shelves were loaded with Elites. Now they're gone.<eos> Three dozen gorgeous rims.<eos> They didn't take anything else?<eos> They went for my good stuff.<eos> Chrome with gold trim. Five grand worth.<eos> What about the alarm?<eos> What about it?
When they crack your bones it goes, "Urgh!" and then, "Arrhhh."<eos> but not sort of, "Ahhh..." but sort of, "Arrrgh!"<eos> All the way up your spine.<eos> "Crack your bones."<eos> They arrange you into a nice, comfortable...<eos> Rrra-poom! Sometimes it doesn't crack, it just goes...<eos> Then they pull a mallet from their belt and try to make the noise.<eos> "Make the noise, I live for the noise."<eos> They do your head as well, get it into a nice position.<eos> You're thinking, "No, I don't think it's supposed to go round that far!
Hey, buddy, whatcha got?<eos> A turtle.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> What're you gonna do with it?
Of course, before we even brought it inside, had to have Fred sit down in it.<eos> I said, "No, thanks. "<eos> I had processed a couple of rolls of film, photos that I took for engineering purposes-- detail stuff, so you'd know how it looked before you took it apart.<eos> I went through it and said, "What the hell's this?"<eos> We had a magnifier and we were trying to figure out what was there. We saw what appeared to be more than one image.<eos> As far as I understand it, certain objects give off auras, and some objects that have been exposed to high-intensity electromagnetic fields... absorb some of that energy and would give off an aura.<eos> I don't know what we photographed.<eos> We don't know if we photographed an entity. We don't know what's there.<eos> It may still reside in the parts that are in Tennessee.<eos> When I tore the chair apart, maybe it was freed.
The girl rubbed her clothes on the wall trying desperately to tear them.<eos> When they had finally been torn she got some milk and bread as well as a little cheese and butter and set out for her mother's house.<eos> she met a wolf who asked her what she was carrying.<eos> Milk and bread... she answered.<eos> When the wolf asked for some... saying it was a present for her mother.<eos> The wolf asked whether she'd be taking the path of pins or the path of needles.<eos> When the girl said she was going to take the path of pins the wolf hurried off down the path of needles and ate up the little girl's mother.<eos> The girl finally reached her mother's house.<eos> she said.<eos> It's not locked answered the wolf.
B:<eos> Women that give you just enough head to shut you up.<eos> You ever meet them women?<eos> They're like, "You okay?"<eos> I hate them women!<eos> And number three, my favorite woman:<eos> the woman that likes nothing better than to suck a dick.<eos> That's right, God bless all of you!<eos> That's right, you make the world a better place to live in.<eos> I want you to suck my dick like you think the antidote's in it!
The gauge isn't working.<eos> Yes, it has a problem.<eos> Farzad, get out.<eos> - ls there water here?<eos> - Yes, over there.<eos> Get out, guys, and check the car.<eos> Try to find out what's wrong.<eos> Has your car broken down?<eos> Our car?<eos> It's given up the ghost.
Get out, guys, and check the car.<eos> Try to find out what's wrong.<eos> Has your car broken down?<eos> Our car?<eos> It's given up the ghost.<eos> Meaning?<eos> It can't go on.<eos> You know, a car is like a man.<eos> It needs to rest and restore itself.<eos> It's given up the ghost.
How likely is that ?<eos> Well - very likely it's actually Darling.<eos> Because I've just built one.<eos> Stuff and nonsense !<eos> I heard some rubbish in my time ... every time I open my mouth as a matter of fact, but a time maschine ? ! It is just cobblers !<eos> I'm gonna show you it is not.<eos> This is the original sketch-book by Leonardo Da Vinci.<eos> And in the last year I my self have built a time maschine , to his exact specifications.<eos> Ladies and gentleman, the greatest breakthrough in travel since Mr. Rodney Tricycle thought to himself<eos> "I'm bored with walking I think I invent a machine with three wheels and a bell, and name it after my self."
He liked the smell.<eos> The smell?<eos> The smell of blood?<eos> During Ikedaya, you were on watch.<eos> You asked if the Choshu were crazy for wanting to set Kyoto ablaze and take the emperor captive, to have him with them.<eos> Did I really say that?<eos> They're not crazy, they're quite lucid.<eos> Where high-spirited men gather, arguing back and forth, for days on end, about illusions, they come to believe that the shogun can be easily overthrown.<eos> The militia is no less utopian.<eos> It emanates a certain energy. Young men are drawn to it.
- Someone stole Robert's bass.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Can we use your bass? - What?<eos> - Your bass?<eos> - Are you crazy?<eos> You out of your fucking mind?<eos> I need it only once.<eos> You'll get it back right after we play.<eos> It's just sitting there.<eos> No, it's been sitting there for 15 years, leave it.
Spread them.<eos> Keep low.<eos> Swing like this.<eos> Oh my...<eos> Pick up the bat!<eos> God!<eos> It's too heavy.<eos> Incoming!<eos> Keep your eye on the ball.<eos> It's already gone!
Get back here!<eos> Which way is south?<eos> That way.<eos> So the front door will be here.<eos> All the electronics go here.<eos> And here's the bathroom.<eos> - A big one. This big!<eos> - What about our room?<eos> Our room?<eos> Where do you want it?
If a cop arrests me, for instance, he'II try to get money not to take me to jail.<eos> He's not making only his salary.<eos> If you had a good television set or a good VCR, they would take it away.<eos> They wouldn't even ask if you had proof that you've bought it in a store.<eos> They'd say that it was stolen, even when the owner was an honest person.<eos> I'II say to myself The police are corrupt.<eos> The institution was designed to be violent and corrupt.<eos> And people think that's odd.<eos> Why do I say it was designed that way?<eos> Because it was created to protect the State and the elite.
When the whole vessel had been carefully numbered, it was completely disassembled, all the parts were put in specially made wooden cases and sent to Congo.<eos> At the shipyard over there, Belgian experts who had travelled there would put the ship together again and clinch it.<eos> THE "KIVU",JOB NR. 647, ON LAKE TANGANYKA<eos> Now ships sail to Belgian Congo with ships in the holds.<eos> KING ALBERT, QUEEN ELISABETH AND PRINCE LEOPOLD<eos> ATTHE INAUGURATION OF THE HOSPITAL SHIP "BELGIQUE"<eos> FOR BELGIAN CONGO.JOB NR. 501.<eos> Frans Boel becomes mayor of Temse.<eos> Jef Pauwels, yard number 1, retires after more than 60 years of service and receives a gold medal.<eos> His wife has the medal valued and is told it's not made from real gold.
At present, there are 650 yard numbers working at the Zaat.<eos> The craftsman-workman calls himself a worker, aware of his identity.<eos> There is strength in his numbers.<eos> Modernisation, upgraded draughtsmen offices, new forges and joineries.<eos> Not only machines to punch holes for rivets in the plates, but also the first presses to shape the steel plates.<eos> This is one of the two 500-tonne hydraulic presses.<eos> If you look at the front or the rear of a ship, you can see the streamlined forms.<eos> These streamlined forms are made by means of this machine.<eos> For a plate worker, this is one of the most complicated machines to operate.<eos> Not only do you have to know its power and be able to work with it, you also have to be able to calculate the effect on the plate when it is pressed under this powerful machine.
PARTTHREE<eos> - HANGOVER (1986 - 1997)<eos> The Boel ships were too expensive and competition from Asia was too strong.<eos> Despite quality and a great technical know-how, foreign orders stayed out.<eos> The shipyard owners, the Van Damme-Saverys families, explored other markets : shipowning, harbour activity, financial services.<eos> Boel shipyard now depends on orders of the family's own shipping company.<eos> And this shipping company makes its orders dependent on shipping loans, the advantageous government loans.<eos> There were dismissals, the great Cockerill Yards went bankrupt, and Boel shipyard Temse fell partially into government's hands.<eos> ...were obliged to apply for a composition.<eos> January. At a press conference at Boel shipyard, the employers announce they will file for bankruptcy, but it is averted at the very last minute.
Dynamite's cheaper. -But...<eos> Shreeve, your just not a practical guy.<eos> All that's ever mattered to you, is your research, which is why, I had to bail out your company.<eos> And now, it's time for me to see some return on my investment.<eos> I want you to solve a problem for me.<eos> What?<eos> Not what, who.<eos> This company has always ment a great deal to me.<eos> But now, I'm ashame of it.<eos> Ashamed of way it's forgoten it's history.
- I didn't get this job because of my looks.<eos> I really, really believe that.<eos> I've researched this town's history, extensively.<eos> - So why have we not seen them before this?<eos> - They were driven out 100 years ago.<eos> Happily, Balthazar was killed.<eos> I don't know by whom.<eos> And they're back cos...?<eos> Balthazar had an amulet, purported to give him strength.<eos> When he was killed, it was taken by a wealthy landowner named...

No. I was with my friend, Buffy.<eos> - We were at Faith's, watching TV.<eos> - What did you watch?<eos> Some old movie.<eos> Infomercial.<eos> That's funny.<eos> Cos I've got a couple of witnesses who put you near the alley.<eos> Witnesses?<eos> Somebody stabbed this guy through the heart. Strange thing is the weapon.<eos> It was made outta wood.
- They'll be here, sir.<eos> - Call me Richard.<eos> You've done a great job here.<eos> I know things are, well, different here in Sunnydale.<eos> We've seen all sorts of things.<eos> What's important is that we keep it under control.<eos> - And that's what you've done.<eos> - I believe in order.<eos> Sunnydale owes you a debt.<eos> It will be repaid.
Why didn't you sell that urn? You're supposed to sell it.<eos> - I think you'd better leave.<eos> - No.<eos> Don't you understand? - You have to sell it before the curse.<eos> - Curse? What curse?<eos> The urn, it's cursed.<eos> Never mind.<eos> Forget it. I'll get rid of it myself.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It is cursed.
I told you, but you didn't wanna believe me.<eos> - Piper, I wanted...<eos> - But you didn't.<eos> Okay, we gotta...<eos> We gotta get your legs up.<eos> Don't worry about me.<eos> There's someone...<eos> - We have to get the arrow out.<eos> - No, don't touch it.<eos> It's tipped with poison.
- We don't need to discuss this.<eos> - K? Let's go upstairs.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Jen?<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> Abby...and I were on the dock and....and we were up there... and we...we were drinking...and she... fell back and hit her head...and she... she drowned.<eos> Abby's dead.<eos> Seems like a lifetime ago.<eos> Your mother loved that dress.<eos> I told her to take it back, too expensive.
A public defender investigator was just here.<eos> It seems some bleeding heart claims you coerced Rollins to tell you where he left her.<eos> Did you coerce him for information to save his life?<eos> - You're out of line.<eos> - It's okay, I'll answer that.<eos> It's fair to say I pressured Mr. Rollins.<eos> You never fail to impress me.<eos> I didn't think you'd cross that line.<eos> You may want to reflect on if that's how you'd really characterize what happened.<eos> Because, unfortunately, in this country when a confession's coerced, it's usually thrown out.
- Yeah. That would be my guess.<eos> All this time I'm worrying about HIV and I get hepatitis C?<eos> We should do the biopsy.<eos> I might be wrong.<eos> Wouldn't be the first time.<eos> Maybe the second time, huh?<eos> Maybe the third time.<eos> Wow. I just thought she was anxious about the surgery.<eos> - She is.<eos> - It's scheduled for this morning.
Maybe I did.<eos> I left the house in such a hurry.<eos> - Are you sure you' re on this level?<eos> - What? - Did you park on this level?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Every day I park on four so I can get a space.<eos> This is three.<eos> What an idiot.<eos> After a while they all look the same.<eos> I swear, I'd forget my head if it wasn't attached.
Fat man with his kids and dog Drove in through the morning fog<eos> Hey, there, Rover<eos> Come on over<eos> Well, it's nice to have music while we eat.<eos> Red-headed lady Reachin' for an apple<eos> Gonna take a bite<eos> Uh, no, no<eos> She's gonna breathe on it first Wipes it on her blouse<eos> She takes a bite<eos> Chews it once Twice, three times
- But I thought we were having fun.<eos> - We were.<eos> But now it might be nice to watch other people have fun or get killed.<eos> - You know, whatever's on. - Look, Peter.<eos> This is a dangerous mission.<eos> And it's likely one of us will be killed.<eos> The landing party will consist of myself, Mr. Spock, Dr. McCoy, and Ensign Rickey.<eos> Crap.<eos> Sorry, Lois. There's only one show I want to see.<eos> It's called Make Every Day Count, starring Peter Griffin as himself.
Are you gonna scream? Call attention to us?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I've got to get back out there.<eos> Not before you tell me something.<eos> I want to know something right now. How do I get this worm out of me?<eos> What, you're not going to tell me?<eos> Or there is no way?<eos> What is the point of all this?<eos> Why did your people grow this stuff to begin with?<eos> It was brought here, planted here by the Others.
No! No!<eos> - Bekhesh, you're killing him!<eos> - Yes, you're right!<eos> - Why was he killed?<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Who'd pay to get him back?<eos> - The Consortium of Trao will!<eos> There is truth to my words Bekhesh. I will prove his value!<eos> The fame of Dominar Rygel, has spread even to my worlds...<eos> If the ransom is not paid by his people, it will be paid by mine!
If we can't pull this thing off without being spotted, we're screwed.<eos> - And what if you are spotted?<eos> - Cover and retreat!<eos> Well, with what?<eos> Well someone blew up our only weapon!<eos> Take this!<eos> Oh yes, a sword!<eos> Thank you! That'll be really helpful!<eos> It is more than just a sword!<eos> - Is it charged?
- Another bounty hunter showed up.<eos> - Another one?<eos> She caught a solar flare in the face as she was taking him out.<eos> Don't help me, Crichton.<eos> You can't look after yourself, not right now, so stop acting like a bad-ass Peacekeeper.<eos> Ex-Peacekeeper, actually.<eos> I know...<eos> Furlow...<eos> We're gonna need that module... soon!<eos> The scent... It's gone.
-Nice car.<eos> -Yeah, it's not mine.<eos> -I love your car.<eos> -Yeah, it's mine.<eos> -I bet it's fast. -Me too.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And comfortable.<eos> -You like leather seats?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> It's got them!
That Porsche I've got the keys to? Still there.<eos> Shocking, since you still have the keys.<eos> You should see the treatment I get with that car.<eos> People are friendly.<eos> They wanna talk. And not just about the car.<eos> One guy advised me on my equity investments.<eos> What equity investments?<eos> The ones that got me the Porsche.<eos> Will you keep up?<eos> If people see me just standing there, they're gonna think I don't own it.
-Man, that one was a blast.<eos> -Not just a blast...<eos> ... itwasasacredtributetomy ancestral prototypes... ... whichtooktheform of a drinking contest.<eos> Bender, I respect your diversity to the extent the law requires. But you used all your days off when you had Roberculosis.<eos> All right, I'll go.<eos> But I'll hold a grudge against every last one of you... ... fortherestofyour lives.<eos> Well then, it's settled.<eos> So long, everyone.<eos> So, this planet is completely uninhabited?<eos> No. It's inhabited by robots.
- So get ready, all you flesh-pounding worshippers... - What are they?<eos> - Zip files. Fight to the death.<eos> - Two hundred and fifty pounds of digitally compressed testosterone. - What?<eos> Without further ado, I give you in the yellow corner, wearing none other than yellow trunks... from parts unknown, weight unknown, height unknown. He likes long walks on the beach and quality time at home alone with his cat... The Man in the Yellow Trunks!<eos> And his opponent in the red corner, wearing none other than red trunks... from parts unknown, weight unknown, height unknown. I don't know what else to say other than I bet against him...<eos> So ladies and gentlemen, fasten your seat belts because we are ready... to get it on!<eos> - Wait here.<eos> - Pinocchio. Hey.<eos> Troops are mobilizing as I speak.<eos> Operation begins at 2200 hours. When it's done, we'll add to our borders 60 miles of eastern seaboard... with the entire state of NewJersey completely under siege.
- Santiago has a portal.<eos> - That's impossible.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> Where is it?<eos> Ask him.<eos> - What? You know where it is?<eos> - I used to work for Santiago, okay?<eos> Central Security, 14th floor.<eos> But you need security clearance.<eos> It's encoded on his implant.
I don't know, sir.<eos> I haven't seen him for hours.<eos> Raglan is no longer on that submarine, commander.<eos> When I showed Flannik his wife, I saw fear, I got through.<eos> I'm gonna need a helo ASAP.<eos> Not nice to disturb a lady in the shower, Jack.<eos> Damn it, Harm. You nearly gave me a heart attack.<eos> Fake left, move right.<eos> Let's have the weapon.<eos> It's loaded with blanks.
I'm listening.<eos> Don't turn the other cheek.<eos> It just makes me wanna smack it.<eos> You're right about your first observation.<eos> I am a wimp.<eos> That said, I'm less naive than I appear to be.<eos> Sometimes I use that quality to get what I need.<eos> You're wrong about the third point.<eos> I don't presume anything.<eos> Your father accepted our charity and the conditions upon which it is given.
I'm gonna need to look at that.<eos> I'm Lieutenant Commander Rabb with the JAG Corps.<eos> We're conducting a mishap investigation.<eos> I'm John Newman.<eos> My company handles the hazardous materials contract.<eos> This isn't something you wanna mess around with, commander.<eos> - It's been eaten through.<eos> - Careful.<eos> When was the last time that line was inspected, commander?<eos> It's inspected daily.
You call cocaine a legitimate business?<eos> He told me they were cigars for his uncle.<eos> Cuban cigars. You can't get them in the States.<eos> Mrs. Dunston, nobody is gonna believe that.<eos> I swear, it's true.<eos> So your meeting with Rojas had nothing to do with drugs?<eos> No, commander. It did.<eos> I got a tip Rojas was there to give drugs to a military wife.<eos> You wouldn't know anything about that tip, would you, commander?<eos> Yes, sir. I sent it.
X-rated video tapes?<eos> - No, we did not.<eos> - You found comic books.<eos> Yes.<eos> You found comic books.<eos> No further questions.<eos> Redirect, Your Honour.<eos> Do you recognise this comic book? Yes.<eos> It's called Rape Man.<eos> It was seized from the defendant's home. Rape Man?
- They're growing.<eos> Any progress?<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - I'm consulting on that multiple in Florida.<eos> Thought I'd stop by.<eos> I'm really kind of busy.<eos> Red lacquer bowls.<eos> They don't make these any more.<eos> The lacquer is loaded with metal. Gold dust, mercury.<eos> It's designed to reflect the subtleties of candlelight.
What conclusion would you jump to?<eos> I never had reason to doubt your commitment before, Rachel.<eos> - You still don't.<eos> - Who else could have let her go?<eos> - I didn't.<eos> Too much was at stake.<eos> - You spoke to her with kindness.<eos> I thought in time she'd join us, for the child's sake.<eos> Where is your vestment, Rachel?<eos> It was soaked at the delivery.
What about Gerry Neilson, the ranger?<eos> What about him?<eos> I don't even remember if he was there.<eos> So she drowned more than two miles upstream from where her car was found.<eos> Right.<eos> It's... in my report.<eos> No, Wayne.<eos> It's not.<eos> - Says right here.<eos> - It says it was found at mile marker 27.1.
I believe you.<eos> Did you ever see her again?<eos> I found her later on.<eos> She was... passed out in her car on the side of the road.<eos> Show me where.<eos> Gerry, you may be the last person that saw her alive.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's important.<eos> - This is where her car was abandoned?<eos> - It wasn't abandoned when I came by.
He was here.<eos> Who are you?<eos> You think you can help him?<eos> You think you can know him?<eos> Know his fear?<eos> To explain it and make it go away?<eos> I know you.<eos> What do you want?<eos> To show you Frank's fear... is real.<eos> And that all your science and understanding and psychiatry are powerless against it.
Weapons-grade anthrax takes about 8,000 spores to introduce an infection,<eos> The variant they created in the lab takes three, The Millennium Group developed a vaccine,<eos> - People can be inoculated.<eos> - There's only enough for Group members.<eos> And their families.<eos> And their families, Peter?<eos> The letter Origo received was dispatched from Hillsborough.<eos> Their vans collect from 83 mailboxes.<eos> But it's an a. m.<eos> Time stamp, which makes it likely it was mailed either from the post office itself or from one of the 21 boxes that has an a. m. Pick-up.
That's where the lock is that the key fits.<eos> - I'm going there.<eos> - Have you completely lost it?<eos> No, I've found it.<eos> And you guys are too scared to admit it.<eos> Gimme the keys to theJeep.<eos> Let's just wait until we can find out more about this place.<eos> Max, I'm connected to this thing, all right?<eos> I see it when I close my eyes.<eos> I dream about it when I go to sleep.
Forget it.<eos> It was a long time ago. Oh, my God.<eos> That's... That's right.<eos> I can't believe I actually wore that thing! L...<eos> I had that dress in kindergarten.<eos> I didn't know you until the third grade.<eos> - Did you, like, read my mind or something?<eos> - No. I don't read minds.<eos> When I healed you, I made this... I don't know. This connection.<eos> An image of that dress flashed into my mind... and I knew how you felt about it.
Only way to stay on top.<eos> In the air, I'm an ace.<eos> On the ground I'm a circus freak.<eos> What's happening to you?<eos> There's not enough room up here for all the bells and whistles, so some of it had to come out.<eos> My implant links my brain directly with the flight-control computers.<eos> The computers take over whatever functions my brain has lost. And without the link, my brain forgets to tell my body how to function.<eos> You knew you were gonna die and you still came with us?<eos> I stole a chip from the lab.<eos> It was supposed to allow my implant to function independently from the network.
Many spoke of scarabs, Ran into a mutant in the pyramid,<eos> Insects? We'll fix timer using insects?<eos> Scarabs were and jewels, They have three-dimensional structure of atoms that repeat identical structure,<eos> What does it mean?<eos> -Vibriraju, Sometimes the high frequencies as if they were alive,<eos> Would you please explain that i<eos> I'm getting a vibrating sample in the crystalline range,<eos> It is very weak, but certainly in this range,<eos> This element of direction, Fits dimensional vibration,<eos> Looks like it is worn or damaged,
Colin. Thank god.<eos> Easy.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> Kolitar's here.<eos> I know. Where's Quinn and Remmy?<eos> Kolitar wants us out of the way.<eos> He framed Quinn for murder.<eos> In a few hours, your friends are gonna be having a little throat trouble.<eos> I need to borrow your gun.<eos> It's gone.
You were nice to have a party for your friend.<eos> "Tufts Medical School."<eos> You're a doctor.<eos> What do you think? About Jackie?<eos> I'd have to know more about his condition.<eos> I told you about his condition. He's got cancer.<eos> What kind of cancer?<eos> It's in the intestines.<eos> There was a tumor and they took it out.<eos> And it's recurred.
Describe the anger you felt at that moment.<eos> I, I wanted to hurt him.<eos> To take revenge for all the humiliation he caused me.<eos> Your anger was a source of strength.<eos> It protected you, gave you courage.<eos> I suppose it did.<eos> And when the Doctor tried to take a holo-photograph of you?<eos> I was annoyed.<eos> The rage within you runs deep.<eos> It's been with you for many years.
Your friend's soul is clean.<eos> If you wish, he'll be given a Christian burial.<eos> - What?<eos> - You're free to go.<eos> I insist that you remain in chains until you return to the Circle of Darkness,... ..to whatever dark place you reside,... ..and that you never return.<eos> Because you know if I did return that I would break your damn neck.<eos> But of course you could just touch that lovely ring,... ..and we'd all be struck down again.<eos> Ah, the ring.<eos> This has been handed down... ..through generations of village canons who came before me.<eos> And with it you maintain power.

Where is she?<eos> I do not know.<eos> Teal'c, if she doesn't receive medical attention soon, she's going to get worse.<eos> I won't lie to you - she could die.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Can I get you some coffee? - Please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, you came to the one person you don't trust.<eos> I don't know how far up the infiltration goes.<eos> It may be contained within the SGC, but if General Hammond was compromised... He sounded fine to me on the phone.
The President and Joint Chiefs will not risk further loss of life, sir.<eos> Those are their orders.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm afraid if your people are gonna make it back,... ..they're gonna have to do it on their own.<eos> I see.<eos> - Thank you, Major.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> Sir, I've been thinking.<eos> The barrier extends for miles around the facility.<eos> It must be powered from the inside - a field generator.
So... Hey, guys.<eos> So, what's going on? I'll talk to you guys later.<eos> So, Eric... what were you and Donna talking all hot and heavy about?<eos> Really? No. We're going out to dinner tomorrow night.<eos> For Valentine's Day. No.<eos> Donna and I are going to the library to study tomorrow night. On Valentine's Day?<eos> Who studies on Valentine's Day?<eos> I didn't know it was Valentine's Day when I made the date.<eos> To study. I'm sure she just forgot about you.<eos> We just talked about it a minute ago.
I work with the communications director and press secretary to get our message out through the media.<eos> While my role here is seen as politically skewed remember, it's not the DNC, but your taxes that pay my salary.<eos> So I work for you, whether you voted for us or not.<eos> How about some history?<eos> I graduated law school and started at Dewey Ballantine...<eos> Actually, I meant a history of the building.<eos> - The White House? - Yes.<eos> The White House was built several years ago mostly, if I'm not mistaken, out of cement.<eos> The room we're in, the Roosevelt Room, is famous.<eos> It is named after our 18th president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Ow.<eos> Just tell me how many of those tapes there are and how I get 'em back.<eos> Oh yeah, I can get that information just like that.<eos> Just let me e-mail headquarters first, all right?<eos> Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.<eos> ( laughs )<eos> I have no friggin' idea!<eos> We made like 50 and sold them to video stores all over Manhattan.<eos> All over Man-- you lowlife!<eos> Listen, I've built a big life for myself and now it's ruined.
- You got the same last name.<eos> Oh, you're good.<eos> We're done here.<eos> Come on, babe.<eos> You must have been a Betty back in the day.<eos> A Betty?<eos> Back in the day.<eos> Scully.<eos> What about the murder weapon?<eos> All I know is, we put the flashlight in here, and now it's gone.
Do you think it could be passed along by the father?<eos> I wouldn't look to the father as any kind of dark force here.<eos> I think it's the mother.<eos> Virginia law on third-trimester abortions requires you to put her under arrest.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Labor was induced.<eos> In the mother's blood was a significant trace of an herb called mandrake.<eos> It's a poison that's been known to facilitate self-abortion.<eos> Mandrake?<eos> It's also been known to be used as a hallucinogenic.
- Five milligrams of haloperidol, I.M.<eos> - I want him in five-point restraints. Yes, sir.<eos> My God.<eos> What happened here?<eos> They said you speak English.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - I'm sorry. You must wonder who I am.<eos> I'm Amina Ngebe.<eos> I have come to see your discovery.<eos> I asked that no one be told about it, nor that I'm here.
And I will have it!<eos> Gabrielle! Naima's not Alti's enemy! It's the Mandhi!<eos> Gabrielle...<eos> Gabrielle...<eos> Thank you, Xena.<eos> You destroyed Alti at the one time in her karma when she was most powerful.<eos> -The one time?<eos> -Oh, yes. Her soul is not destroyed.<eos> It will return many times, filled with evil.<eos> But you will always be there to meet it.
Someone with motive enough for murder?<eos> Someone who's trying to confuse us?<eos> Someone who's looking to beat this rap the best he can no matter what the cost.<eos> I did it.<eos> Boy... Whatever Mom's been putting in her grub didn't agree with her.<eos> Check it out.<eos> Look at this rash.<eos> Is that blood?<eos> No, it's ink.<eos> There's a large bump on the skull underneath it?
-Then you're immortal?<eos> Not quite.<eos> There is one being that could kill me.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> Indrujid.<eos> -What is the truth?<eos> -So you really wanna know?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -It's life.<eos> That we must revere it, wherever we find it. To bring peace to this world I have to teach mankind a reverence for life.
This is Vergon 6.<eos> It's a sunny little doomed planet inhabited by frisky, doomed animals.<eos> -Animals?<eos> -That's right.<eos> Animals in need of rescue.<eos> Vergon 6 was once filled with the dense substance "Dark Matter. "<eos> Each pound of it weighs over 1 0,000 pounds.<eos> Wait. What about the animals?<eos> Well, Dark Matter is valuable as starship fuel.<eos> That's why it was mined out, leaving the planet hollow.
Amy Wong?<eos> Of the Mars Wongs?<eos> Look, we're not as rich as everybody says.<eos> -What's your sorority?<eos> -Kappa Kappa Wong.<eos> Hey, rich girl, look over here!<eos> It's me, Bender.<eos> I'm being entertaining.<eos> La-la-la, look at my head!<eos> It's all painted, look at my head!
I am not gonna be bossed around by a chick!<eos> Maybe I'll just use my Wild Wild West techniques and get proof that Shelly had a boyfriend over.<eos> Goddammit, Kitty! You have to calm down!<eos> Here, I'll get you some catnip!<eos> Okay! Okay! Hold on!<eos> Rafp Rugnaf fills muh ahsi SOE!<eos> Demons from hell seek the chosen one!<eos> You're such an amazing poet, Styler!<eos> Isn't this guitar awsome?<eos> t's the best of its kind! And not a scratch on it!
Spike: It's called giving, Faye.<eos> Think of us as Fairy Godparents. We're about to grant the princess' a very special wish.<eos> Faye:<eos> Robot ships...!<eos> ? So these must be the evil stepsisters.<eos> Shit! They're trying to scare us!<eos> Ed: I got it!<eos> Jet: Spike!<eos> Come back in!<eos> What's, that! ? It looks like if we apply enough energy to the stone we can draw out the forces trapped inside it.
- Our car, Walter?<eos> - And what do they got?<eos> My dirty undies.<eos> My fucking whites!<eos> Say, Dude?<eos> Where is your car?<eos> - Who's got your undies, Walter?<eos> - Where's your car, Dude?<eos> You don't know, Walter?<eos> It was parked in a handicap zone.
is this your only lD?<eos> I know my rights, man.<eos> You don't know shit, Lebowski.<eos> I want a fucking lawyer, man.<eos> I want Bill Kunstler, man, or Ron Kuby.<eos> Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.<eos> Mr. Treehorn treats opjects like women, man.<eos> Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town.<eos> You don't draw shit, Lebowski.<eos> Now, we got a nice quiet little beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet.
- Just some girl. Girlfriend I had.<eos> - What happened to her?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm a free guy, you know.<eos> I need to be free a little, so I let her go, you know?<eos> Can I get a little room here?<eos> Why don't you go sit over there?<eos> I need a little privacy.<eos> Hey, Sonny! Where's my ball?<eos> I got it right here.
Get in.<eos> Phil's dead.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> How you doing, Edward?<eos> I'm OK.<eos> Is that what you're asking?<eos> Yeah, I'm OK.<eos> Good.<eos> Mickey, I got a letter from Phil.<eos> Phil... it's postmarked on the day.
He just likes to spoil me.<eos> Well, good man.<eos> Oh, honey, a watch.<eos> No, you're not supposed to do that.<eos> It's an antique.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> - It's broken.<eos> - That's OK. It's still very...<eos> It's a bracelet, you see?<eos> I mean, yes, it's stopped.
Be that as it may, Drew, a question can often be argued both ways.<eos> Joe, cut it out.<eos> You, too, Drew.<eos> - I thought this was practically a done deal.<eos> - Well, now it's undone, okay?<eos> Forget Bontecou. Scrub him.<eos> I'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer.<eos> I'm not going for it.<eos> Bill, why at this juncture are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?<eos> 'Cause I don't want anybody buying up my life's work! Turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.
They gave me a tour.<eos> The oldest living thing on the planet.<eos> We would have heard of it by now.<eos> It lives out of sight, in the earth... in deep geological structures.<eos> - But if it comes up to feed... - Rarely. Mostly it sifts life forms from the soil... like a whale sifts tiny krill and plankton... from the ocean.<eos> No doubt it feeds on marine life too.<eos> It may lie dormant between feeding for years or decades.<eos> Over centuries, only a tiny percentage of its prey has been human beings.<eos> It has absorbed knowledge... acquired intelligence.<eos> This thing can assume the form of anything it's absorbed?
Caution!<eos> you know what she is capable of?<eos> In one day it befall more trees that 500 men in a month!<eos> I will be harvesting the forest from here to... the Pacific!<eos> The Barber of Siberia<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Listen!<eos> You hear?<eos> You hear the music?<eos> You hear me sing it?
I'm telling you it's bullshit!<eos> Just leave, so I can think! For me, okay?<eos> Just leave!<eos> Just go, Bobby. Go.<eos> - You want a blend?<eos> I'd like to have a room for the evening, please.<eos> I'm sorry, sir. This card was declined.<eos> This is a brand-new card.<eos> Try it again, please.<eos> You know, maybe it's not activated yet.
Congratulations.<eos> As of this morning, you made it to the very top of our own perp board.<eos> I don't have to tell you how profoundly pissed Lomax is.<eos> He's keeping a lid on it to cover his ass, but you don't have much time.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you find out who the shooter is?<eos> Whatever happened to, "Good morning.<eos> "How are you?<eos> Sorry about your car.<eos> "It got impounded. You won't be able to get it for two weeks. "
Am I what you expected?<eos> I totally approve.<eos> - You're not here with anyone?<eos> - Just my friend.<eos> Hottie police officer?<eos> I was really looking forward to meeting you in court on June 6th.<eos> - So, do you guys wanna dance?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Oh, I love this song.<eos> - I'm getting kind of sick of it.
- Only the beautiful Leo DiCaprio.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Leonardo DiCaprio.<eos> - How far away is London, anyway?<eos> - Well, from here it's 3,000 miles, but sometimes it seems much further.<eos> - How far away is your home?<eos> - Oh, the other end of the country.<eos> Actually, here's a picture of my house.<eos> - Wow! It's beautiful.<eos> - We built it when I was little.
The gate takes 5 seconds to close.<eos> Hug the right side of the wall as I drive by. Then you enter the stairs by the service elevator.<eos> The key to the front door also works here for the service entrance.<eos> I'm going to take the key from Emily's purse before I leave and I'll put it in this and hide it here, right behind the pipe.<eos> - Where're you going to be?<eos> - At my regular card game.<eos> Why don't you leave me your key?<eos> My key implicates me.<eos> Her key implicates no one.<eos> It could've been lost or stolen.
It's over, right?<eos> Done.<eos> Come back here ever again.<eos> I have a mandate in the ass.<eos> Tuesday morning at 4 o'clock are showing for your rights.<eos> Energy.<eos> It is the source.<eos> Nothing happens without energy.<eos> The more you have, ye draw over it.<eos> But it such as gasoline for the car.
That's what you call it.<eos> Yeah, that's true.<eos> He said it would clear up on its own... if she just stayed away from fried foods and sweets.<eos> Except it's spread to her lips now, too.<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> And you say it was just red?<eos> Well, you know, like real red.<eos> I know what you mean.<eos> That's like this car that was in front... of Bill Johnson's soda shop.<eos> I was going by it and it looked green.
Something went wrong.<eos> The wooden gate is opening.<eos> The accounts are confused, but they refer to an inverse exorcism.<eos> The body is destroyed, but the possessed soul remains.<eos> Valek was transformed into a creature whose body is dead but lives on.<eos> A vampire.<eos> A vampire.<eos> It's a cross.<eos> The stories about the Black Cross are true.<eos> It was used in the exorcism and taken to Rome.
Valek was transformed into a creature whose body is dead but lives on.<eos> A vampire.<eos> A vampire.<eos> It's a cross.<eos> The stories about the Black Cross are true.<eos> It was used in the exorcism and taken to Rome.<eos> It's known as the Berziers Cross.<eos> It was shipped to the New World. It was moved from one Spanish mission to another.<eos> Its location was kept secret, even from the Vatican.<eos> For hundreds of years it was lost. Cardinal Alba found the name of the only living priest who knew the location.
And how long is that?<eos> This isn't funny, Delenn.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> - No, it isn't.<eos> Station lockdown has been lifted... but the following areas are still off-limits due to damage and debris.<eos> Grade 1, Grade 10...<eos> I'm sorry for what happened, Captain.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> A lot of people fell under the influence of that thing.<eos> More would've fallen if we hadn't stopped it.
I think we'll meet your price.<eos> Yeah, so let's see it. Let's see it now.<eos> Where do you have it, in your belt?<eos> Let's see it.<eos> Show me the case first.<eos> You're great in the locker room, pal, and your reflexes might die hard... but you're weak when you put your spikes on.<eos> -Gregor, are you all right?<eos> -Gregor's fine.<eos> But I think you're in a wee spot of trouble.<eos> -I don't have it with me.
you can't deal with men!<eos> guys, maybe now is not the time for this.<eos> come on, fisher, this is the perfect time.<eos> this is the real time. we're in the moment.<eos> adam, your brother and myself as well as several others present have always felt that you were a fully repressed, living-in-major-denial, lock-down flyboy.<eos> fire in the hole, big guy.<eos> dear god, please forgive us for what we've done here tonight.<eos> we've lost our way.<eos> speaking for myself, I am deeply in love with the woman i'm about to marry, and I am very much looking forward to raising a family and being a positive member of society.<eos> we promise, if you forgive us, that we will never forget this tragedy and we will try with all our power to use it as a daily reminder that we are on this earth to do good, not evil.
Is it true?<eos> The King has not shared her bed for many months.<eos> He has a repugnance for it, as lately Your Grace has for mine.<eos> Norfolk.<eos> Your Majesties, this is most wondrous news.<eos> Indeed. We do thank God for this, our most happy condition.<eos> We must also thank His Majesty for this blessed event, which is nothing short of a miracle.<eos> What news, my lords, of the rebellion against our authority?<eos> Sussex?<eos> Madam, it is safely dispatched, thanks to His Grace.
That hairdresser drives me crazy!<eos> What time's the play?<eos> Eight?<eos> I can't wait to see this The Lady from Maxim's.<eos> Feydeau staged in French in Japan by a Québec troupe. Very promising!<eos> - Give'em a chance, we haven't seen it.<eos> - l'm sure it's going to be deadly.<eos> They chose his worst play.<eos> If they'd taken... Going to Pot or A Flea in Her Ear, or Don't Run around Naked, but The Lady !<eos> No wonder it's never staged.
- Fifteen sticks?<eos> Ready Demolition, Tucson, Arizona?<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Make sure these don't get wet.<eos> I'll see you at 3:15.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - Rushmore. I've got one last piece of unfinished business to attend to.<eos> - Fischer, you fuck!<eos> - Hello, Magnus.<eos> I'd have shot you in the other ear, but it got blown off a long time ago.
Yes.<eos> So my name is Angelica De Mayo.<eos> Pleasured to meet you.<eos> So what's yours?<eos> It's a pleasure meeting you.<eos> - Hiroshi Imuri.<eos> - Oh, hi.<eos> You know, I work here I'm in PR.<eos> I'm having a conference for this company I work for.<eos> It's called...
- Oh, Mr. Fennyman, I think you might have hit upon something.<eos> Sign there.<eos> So, Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter.<eos> Almost finished ? Oh, without doubt he's completing it at this very moment.<eos> Where is my play ?<eos> Tell me you have it nearly done. Tell me you have it started.<eos> Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move.<eos> No, no, we haven't the time.<eos> Talk prose. Where is my play ?<eos> - It is all locked safe in here.
They're firing!<eos> Stop this goddam music!<eos> They're firing.<eos> A bullet whizzed right past me.<eos> Stop.<eos> What are ya doin'? Ya can't do that, think a minute!<eos> This isn't just any place, it's a private home.<eos> Put the TV down, you can't do that.<eos> I gotta do it!<eos> I gonna smash it down there!
We brought you something.<eos> Mr Fortlow has got something for us.<eos> I didn't know that you are moving.<eos> Howard got a nighttime computer operator's job in Venice.<eos> We got a place over there.<eos> - That's good, Howard. That's real good, Howard.<eos> I guess, that will make this your going away present.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> What is this for?<eos> I found this table, Howard. It was all broken down and scarred up.
That's lovely. Yeah.<eos> Nice big smiles.<eos> Hils!<eos> Hils!<eos> Come over.<eos> Is this one of yours? Does she play?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Hilary won as well, didn't you, dear?<eos> We can have a family portrait. Right.<eos> Could you hold your flute up where I can see it?
It won't give you your licence back.<eos> Well I was hoping for some err... - Mercy?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> But we do show mercy!<eos> We could get you jailed for years... yet you are free.<eos> I'm not free, I'm a pedestrian! I understand.<eos> Without a car, you're like... an orphan.<eos> Yes, a pedestrian orphan!<eos> I understand.<eos> There's a solution, but I'm not sure you'll like it.
Father, do you have a name for this sword?<eos> It's called "The Ultimate Sword,"
Come on!<eos> - What?<eos> - Police...<eos> I need to arrest him.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Go!<eos> When the monkeys had come back to the mountain, he gave his last breath.<eos> This saintly man chose to follow the path of Hanuman.<eos> He dedicated himself to that exemplary life and today in death they have become one.<eos> Let us cherish his memory and learn from it the values of tolerance, courage and loyalty.
Now I know that it's customary on these occasions for the architect to cut the ribbon.<eos> Well, that's not really possible right now. Although, I hope that someday soon it will be.<eos> Well actually, I could cut it with my teeth.<eos> Instead, I'd like to ask the one who was really indispensable on this project, to come up and do the honors.<eos> Claudia Henderson.<eos> Claudia.<eos> Thank you, Mister Mayor.<eos> Thank you, Jason.<eos> Woolrich commissioned the piece from Thorpe.<eos> It's been sitting in our lobby all this time.
Wherever you keep them, in a tin flask or glass jar - time will do its work...<eos> Lie down on your tummy on the fur coat.<eos> This medicine had such sweet smell to it...<eos> Cleared your head, it did - and eyes saw more somehow than usual...<eos> I understood that it were magic...<eos> Zauber, as we called it over there - we missionaries...<eos> Turn over now...<eos> I myself was a missionary in Africa.<eos> Built a church and proclaimed the word of God.<eos> See where it's stung you...
THIS ISN'T TRUE!<eos> All our hopes and dreams are gone...<eos> But they aren't.<eos> Tetsuro...<eos> Captain Harlock...<eos> Your hometown will not be gone, and neither will the Solar System...<eos> Because you are here.<eos> The earth is in your heart.<eos> As long as you exist the Earth will never die.<eos> It won't be gone.
Hey!<eos> Oh my, you're pretty scratched up, huh, Professor.<eos> This is ridiculous!<eos> That beep on the sensor was only a cat!<eos> Come here little kitty...<eos> Why do we have to find the cat?<eos> That cat is also a survivor, and is now one of us.<eos> The Earth...<eos> That's how it looked before the impact of the meteor. Nobody knows what it looks like after the impact.<eos> Wish I could see it.
Ask him to muster the courage somehow and mention it to her.<eos> Thereafter we will see whatever happens.<eos> He will speak. He will speak soon.<eos> In Fact, he leaves home everyday thinking that...<eos> But the moment he comes Face-to-Face with Sonia I wonder why he develops cold Feet.<eos> - l am...<eos> - Yes...<eos> - Go ahead. - Sonia, I am...<eos> You can ask For her hand!<eos> Ask her For it!
Leopard!<eos> - Where's Gokul?<eos> - He went away as soon as he came.<eos> He was saying that he has to repay someone's debt.<eos> Ducks!<eos> Look there!<eos> Sister!<eos> Sister!<eos> Gokul Uncle taught me a new poem!<eos> He said that I should surely make you listen to it.
Anything wrong?<eos> How many times do I have to tell you not to change the way you work?<eos> But I'm only human, you know.<eos> Cut it out.<eos> Tell us.<eos> In the Game Exhibition, we work as companions. Wallets, clothes... all our stuff was stolen from the dressing room.<eos> That's too bad. From defenseless cute girls...<eos> Just stick to the point.<eos> The dressing room is off-limits to outsiders.<eos> So it was tightly guarded. Not really.
If you have finished, I would like to excuse...<eos> What's the hurry?<eos> I should get back to my books.<eos> Don't be a stranger to your own teacher.<eos> A woman should be like cotton candy.<eos> Understand?<eos> So-Young.<eos> So-Young.<eos> Do you know where I can find that painting of your classmate's?<eos> It must've been trashed.
At ease. What's the word?<eos> There is no word, at least not from the Resistance in Sainte Claire.<eos> Then we won't get any support from inside the city.<eos> You may be underestimating the good citizens of Sainte Claire.<eos> I spent a summer there when I was 18. Let me guess.<eos> You ate a few snails, fell in love with a local girl and became an expert on the city.<eos> Uh...well...<eos> Yeah, pretty much like that.<eos> I see. But believe me, Captain, those people love their town.<eos> They'll fight for it and die for it.
Every life.<eos> We are all born as molecules in the hearts of a billion stars molecules that do not understand politics or policies or differences.<eos> Over a billion years we foolish molecules forget who we are and where we came from.<eos> In desperate acts of ego we give ourselves names, fight over lines on maps and pretend that our light is better than everyone else's.<eos> The flame reminds us of the piece of those stars that lives on inside us.<eos> The spark that tells us:<eos> "You should know better."<eos> The flame also reminds us that life is precious as each flame is unique.<eos> When it goes out it's gone forever.<eos> And there will never be another quite like it.
That was too damn close.<eos> If it had gotten all the way into the jumpgate...<eos> - I want those long-range probes extended.<eos> - They're at maximum now.<eos> Use the Starfuries to boost the signal.<eos> I do not want another situation like this.<eos> Very sloppy of them.<eos> It's as I told you, Na'Tok.<eos> The humans do not have the stomach for this war.<eos> We will end it as it should be ended:
It's all right. It's all right. I was just in the neighborhood.<eos> Thought I'd stop in.<eos> Where is everyone?<eos> Well, there's just me, sir.<eos> And the shut-down crew, and a few others.<eos> - What shut-down crew?<eos> - Oh, sorry.<eos> Public announcement hasn't been made. I think they're still working on the press release.<eos> But since this place was turned back over to Earth control a few years ago and what with the recent budget cutbacks and much of what Babylon 5 stands for being done now by the Alliance, well no one comes here anymore. It's...<eos> Well, it's become sort of redundant.
- We have a schedule to keep.<eos> - Understood.<eos> Ambassador Mollari will just have to catch the next liner to Centauri Prime.<eos> Turning orbital control back to your system.<eos> Confirmed. Setting navigational controls to locate Centauri Prime main beacon.<eos> 4-4-3-6-9.<eos> Any idea yet what happened to that cruiser?<eos> We found trace of a chemical explosive material and a detonator.<eos> It looks like the bomb was hooked into the ship's navigational system.<eos> It was programmed to explode when the nav system was set for a particular destination.
That's a good boy. Yeah.<eos> Ta-ta, guys.<eos> And don't worry about Goldie here.<eos> She's gonna love her new home.<eos> Get her.<eos> No matter what it takes.<eos> Look, guys, fun is fun, but enough already.<eos> How about I give this statue back, say I'm sorry and we forget the whole thing?<eos> Too late for that.<eos> It's been defiled.
Well, we could rent out the room at a reduced rate in exchange for help around the house.<eos> Phoebe's good with a wrench.<eos> Phoebe lives in New York.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> What?<eos> She left New York.<eos> She's moving back in with us.<eos> You've got to be kidding.<eos> Well, I could hardly say no.<eos> It's her house too. It was willed to all of us.
Well, it's obvious, Kitty.<eos> Edward's favorite chair- no butt indentation.<eos> His pipe hasn't been smoked in three days.<eos> And the newspaper- no one solved the J umble.<eos> Fascinating, Sherlock.<eos> However, the chair is new.<eos> It arrived this morning.<eos> The pipe is not Edward's, ThomasJeffierson.<eos> We bought it at auction.<eos> It hasn't been smoked in 200 years.
It's a nice gesture, Carol.<eos> I know it's hard to find a match. But people want to help.<eos> I appreciate it. It's just premature.<eos> His biopsy results aren't even back yet.<eos> Let's give the kid a chance, you know?<eos> Now, the pump is computerized.<eos> It'll release the exact amount of pain medicine whenever you push the button.<eos> So you're calling the shots, all right?<eos> Can I OD if I press this too much?<eos> It's programmed to lock out so that won't happen.
- Don't let him die.<eos> - I understand.<eos> I understand. - Please? Don't let him die.<eos> Turkey burger, please.<eos> No onions. What kind of salad dressings do you have?<eos> Caesar, ranch, Italian, blue cheese, honey mustard Catalina, oil and vinegar and poppy seed vinaigrette.<eos> I'll have the soup.<eos> So...<eos> - So. - Enjoying your year?<eos> It's been educational.
- She's not out of the woods yet.<eos> - Does that mean she's gonna die?<eos> That's a possibility.<eos> Do you know her family?<eos> I never saw anyone come to see her.<eos> I only ask because my sister's on a waiting list for an apartment in the building.<eos> I don't really understand why a biopsy was done for a broken leg.<eos> The fracture didn't match what Dana said had happened. It seemed unusual.<eos> - How?<eos> - It may have been caused by a tumor.
You have any sparkling water?<eos> Sparkling water, yeah, uh, all right.<eos> Let me look.<eos> Sparkling water.<eos> Hey, you're losing your beret here.<eos> £­ Where?<eos> £­ On this side.<eos> £­ l got it.<eos> £­ Thanks.<eos> Just fix it a little bit there.
But he doesn't want to see anybody, Father!<eos> Fargo, that's an order.<eos> Take me to see Chris, the unhappy sheep.<eos> God, you should have seen him, he's just a shadow of a sheep.<eos> If I was a sheep, I'd be watching my back right now.<eos> Why?<eos> Because of the beast.<eos> They say it's as big as four cats and it's got a retractable leg so as it can leap up at you better.<eos> And it lights up at night, Ted, and it's got four ears, two are for listening and two are back-up ears, and for some reason it's got a tremendous fear of stamps!<eos> Mrs Doyle says it's got magnets so if you're made of metal it'll stick to you, and instead of a mouth it's got four arses.
Did Corporal Barry, motivated by rage and hatred, kill the terrorist of his own free will?<eos> Or did he, driven by an overwhelming sense of duty, instilled in him by the Corps, impulsively kill the terrorist to save his country?<eos> Major MacKenzie.<eos> Nice closing.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So was yours.<eos> - You've become a fine lawyer, Sarah.<eos> But the world lost a good lap dancer, right?<eos> That suggestion was not meant to make you leave law school.<eos> It was meant to provoke you to keep you in.
He's overdrawn on his excuse account.<eos> The corporal is trying to secure custody rights of his son, sir.<eos> After he serves his time.<eos> Incarceration would seriously hamper his chances, general.<eos> I won't do it.<eos> Do you have children, sir?<eos> I'm going to assume that question was not an attempt to manipulate my feelings, commander.<eos> Because if it was, you're either desperate or stupid.<eos> And neither will play in this room.<eos> The military takes a beating every time it gets involved in the private lives of its personnel.
We're looking for a videotape and it was catalogued with the written statements and an after-action report for Operation Sirocco.<eos> I found the documents, but I can't find the videotape.<eos> That Delaporte guy from ZNN, he asked me the same thing.<eos> Milly, could you just help us out?<eos> It's really important.<eos> Well, these are waiting to be filed.<eos> - Here.<eos> Here. - What is it?<eos> It's footage from Task Force Sandhawk on the Kuwaiti border.<eos> It's been sitting here a while, but we've been waiting for a new case from Processing.
It's got nothing to do with money.<eos> I'm catching flak left and right over this.<eos> - There are mitigating facts.<eos> - They're ready to push a button on Hollis.<eos> - The dope was sent to her for testing.<eos> - It's been tested now.<eos> - Did you find anything strange?<eos> - Stranger than 80 per cent pure heroin?<eos> - Nothing besides that?<eos> - It was cut with lactose and mannitol. Baby laxative.
This time I win.<eos> [Flanagan] You can't be serious.<eos> Melino's lawyer is in Judge Drake's chambers.<eos> Apparently somebody forgot to read these gentlemen their rights.<eos> - Whoops. - [Flanagan] Cut 'em loose.<eos> - Cut 'em loose? You heard me.<eos> [Makes Buzzer Sound] Looks like this time you lose.<eos> Well, I ran a diagnostic.<eos> There's definitely a circuit chip missing.<eos> But isn't there any way of determining... what sort of information was stored on it?
You ain't a safe cracker, are you?<eos> Maybe today, I don't have to be.<eos> You find something?<eos> Yes. Me.<eos> And the red files.<eos> What is saying there about you?<eos> Blood type, blood scans, height, weight, it's all medical.<eos> Except for one thing.<eos> Destination.<eos> Destination? It's blacked out.
Well, it's not what you can do for me. It's more what I can do for you.<eos> Good news.<eos> We found your car.<eos> - My car? - 1994 Mercedes.<eos> ZYP 959.<eos> A couple of fishermen found it submerged out at Wilson Lake.<eos> Did they, uh, find anything... in the car?<eos> Well, it's still too dark to be sure of anything... except the fact that it is indeed your car.<eos> - It is funny though.<eos> Well, looks like it's been down there for a couple of years, but... you never missed a registration payment and you never reported it missing.
Sometimes three women a day, and I was always ready for more.<eos> - Now you're just being cruel.<eos> - No.<eos> It was all ego.<eos> And where I am now is so much better than sex.<eos> Oh, come on, honey.<eos> Nothing's better than sex.<eos> Think about really good f oreplay.<eos> Your sexual energy's just starting to awaken.<eos> Now imagine a three-year foreplay... where all that sexual energy is coursing through your body... but it never gets released.
Aw, come on, Moe.<eos> Think of all you have to offer besides money.<eos> I need cash and lots of it.<eos> Um, all right, everybody, I'm calling in your bar tabs.<eos> [Clamoring] You bunch of ungrateful ingrates!<eos> You-Aw, Homer, what am I gonna do?<eos> Renee's my last chance for true love.<eos> If you really need money, you could sell a kidney or maybe even your car.<eos> Nah, my car ain't won'th nothir.<eos> But it is insured for five grand.
[ Stammering ] All right.Just stay calm, Frinky.<eos> These babies will be in the stores... while he's still grappling with the pickle matrix.<eos> I have here the four greatest inventions... in the history of mankind.<eos> First, my all-purpose electric hammer... for all your pounding needs.<eos> Probably needs to be more powerful.<eos> I'll buy 1 0 of those right now.<eos> Now, here's my "Everything's Okay" alarm.<eos> - [ Alarm Blaring ] - [ Shouting ] This will sound every three seconds... unless something isn't okay.<eos> Turn that off, Homer.<eos> - [ Alarm Continues ] - It can't be turned off.
You kids take care of the wrapping paper.<eos> I'm going to dismantle Love Land.<eos> [Groans] What a terrible waste.<eos> Yes, but the memories will last a lifetime.<eos> [Grunting] Get - Crap-<eos> It's full, Dad.<eos> That means you have to take out the trash.<eos> Yep. That's the rule.<eos> He who tops it off drops it off. Nuh-uh.<eos> It isn't filled until it's spilled.
I saw a picture of Montana in the hospital.<eos> It looks like a huge pit mine.<eos> So, no oil, no gas-powered cars. That explains the horses.<eos> But why does everyone have a gun?<eos> Self-protection.<eos> The border is under siege.<eos> Refugees from the war.<eos> Technically, all citizens are members of the militia.<eos> So, you show me your gun and I'll show you mine.<eos> I left it in the room. Didn't figure on a fire fight over margaritas.
Three light years.<eos> For all we know, she could be in Dominion space by now.<eos> I had a feeling you'd turn up sooner or later.<eos> I know you're angry with me.<eos> Angry?<eos> I feel sorry for you.<eos> Letting yourself be duped by Dukat into joining this cult.<eos> I was a member of this "cult", as you call it, long before Dukat.<eos> I came to it toward the end of the occupation.<eos> It's helped me make sense of the suffering we all had to endure.
Ten days from now Senator Vreenak will be making a trip to Soukara for a diplomatic meeting with Weyoun.<eos> I am certain that he can be persuaded to make a secret detour to DS9 if he were invited by one Captain Benjamin Sisko.<eos> How do you know he'll be visiting Soukara?<eos> There are some things I'd rather not discuss. May I continue? Please.<eos> When Senator Vreenak arrives, you will show him a holographic recording of a secret meeting held at the highest level of the Dominion in which the planned invasion of Romulus is being discussed.<eos> You will tell the Senator that this information was obtained through various covert means at great cost to the Federation.<eos> At least ten good men lost their lives bringing it across the line- that sort of thing.<eos> He will immediately suspect it's a forgery but you will assure him that such a thing would be impossible.<eos> "You see, Senator "this is an official Cardassian transcript.<eos> "It was recorded on a one-time optolythic data rod "used for official record keeping.
I know, but I can't stay away.<eos> It's like the river calls to me.<eos> It's saying, "Stay away. Don't come near me or I'll hurt you more!"<eos> - Much better.<eos> - lt will be tender for a few days.<eos> Right. If the pain gets any worse, Nurse Bandee will give you something.<eos> Thanks, Julian.<eos> Have a good time on Casperia.<eos> I'm going to a medical conference, not on vacation.<eos> If the river calls you again, listen to it and stay away.
Because I share Dukat's bed?<eos> No, because you've fallen in love with him!<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - Back where l belong.<eos> It's composed of ultritium resin, so it's doubtful that the Cardassian sensors will pick it up.<eos> - But there's always a chance.<eos> - You let me worry about that.<eos> - You've done this before?<eos> - You'd be surprised.<eos> Remember, the bomb is set to go off three minutes after it's activated, and once it's activated, it cannot be disarmed.
I'll try accessing helm controls.<eos> We're back in normal space.<eos> Scan for Voyager.<eos> No sign of them.<eos> Commander... we've traveled over 15 light- years.<eos> Captain's Log, supplemental.<eos> After two days at high warp, we've rendezvoused with the Dauntless.<eos> Arturis has helped us reconstruct most of the Starfleet message.<eos> The pieces of this puzzle are finally coming together.<eos> Slipstream technology is experimental and high risk, but it's come a long way in the past year.
We'll be outcasts together.<eos> I'm kidding, Seven.<eos> It's a joke.<eos> Work on that sense of humor.<eos> It'll help you make friends on Earth.<eos> Seven, can you give me a hand down here?<eos> I'm picking up an anomalous energy surge.<eos> There are no power conduits running through this section.<eos> Believe me, Seven, one look at that big, blue marble and you'll fall in love.<eos> It's got just about every ecosystem you can think of and hundreds of different humanoid species live there:
Understood.<eos> Secure the warp core. Yes, Captain.<eos> It would seem that the Hirogen underestimated their latest prey.<eos> You believe they were hunting the creature. Yes.<eos> When the Borg were fighting Species 8472, did they ever engage in physical combat?<eos> On many occasions.<eos> Can you recall anything that might help us here?<eos> Each time they boarded a Borg vessel, they went directly to the central power matrix and disabled it.<eos> The creature was just in Engineering. Didn't touch any of our power systems.<eos> It's obviously adjusted its strategy.
Species 8472 accessed deflector control from this panel.<eos> I've analyzed the transmission protocols.<eos> It was attempting to open a singularity into its realm, but it failed.<eos> It was trying to get home.<eos> That's what it looks like.<eos> The creature initiated telepathic contact with me.<eos> What's it saying?<eos> Its ship was damaged during the conflict with the Borg.<eos> When the other members of its species retreated into fluidic space... it was left behind.<eos> It has been trapped in the Delta Quadrant ever since... alone... pursued by Hirogen hunting parties.
It is dying, Captain.<eos> You have nothing to be afraid of.<eos> We're going to help you get back to your realm.<eos> Does it understand?<eos> It does.<eos> It will take time to open a singularity, and we have no way of treating your injuries, but if there's anything you can tell us about your... lt has lost consciousness.<eos> Our telepathic link has been severed.<eos> Where is my prey?<eos> Lying at the end of a corridor on Deck 1 1... nearly dead thanks to you.<eos> Take me to it.
I still need your expertise in the Astrometrics Lab if you're willing.<eos> If not, you can spend your time here in the cargo bay. is that understood?<eos> Yes.<eos> It is puzzling.<eos> What's that?<eos> You made me into an individual. You encouraged me to stop thinking like a member of the collective, to cultivate my independence and my humanity.<eos> But when I try to assert that independence, I am punished.<eos> Individuality has its limits... especially on a starship where there's a command structure.<eos> I believe that you are punishing me because I do not think the way that you do, because I am not becoming more like you.<eos> You claim to respect my individuality, but in fact, you are frightened by it.
Please.<eos> Why is this so important to you?<eos> Particle zero- one- zero... the Borg designation for what you call Omega.<eos> Every drone is aware of its existence. We were instructed to assimilate it at all costs.<eos> It is... perfection.<eos> The molecules exist in a flawless state-- infinite parts functioning as one.<eos> Like the Borg.<eos> Precisely.<eos> I am no longer Borg, but I still need to understand that perfection.<eos> Without it, my existence will never be complete.
A car's engine can't run on pure fuel, so the carburetor supplies it with a mixture of vaporized fuel and air.<eos> And you think we need a device like that to dilute the particle stream as it enters the coaxial drive.<eos> Exactly, and a spare polaric modulator from Voyager's impulse drive should do the trick.<eos> Subatomic dilution! Oh!<eos> It never would have occurred to me.<eos> I think you've solved it.<eos> Well, we can run a few simulations on the holodeck before we actually try it. Oh...<eos> I owe you a lot.<eos> Well, you can thank my lucky toolbox.<eos> It's gotten me out of hot water more than once. Mmm.
These were run in the press?<eos> I trumped up a story about a crazy Indian on the loose.<eos> Never underestimate the public's willingness to blame the Red Man for... - ...anything they can't explain.<eos> - How did this happen?<eos> He was one of ours.<eos> He must've accidentally injected himself while he was working on the virus.<eos> It took just 12 hours for the creature to gestate.<eos> This thing's alive?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's killed a man.
Temecula! The signal!<eos> Now!<eos> There's the signal!<eos> Get ready to pull back! When the catapults hit!<eos> Fall back!<eos> Disengage!<eos> We can't let 'em fall back!<eos> Come back! Forward!<eos> This battle's over, Xena.<eos> Even if it's fought, I've outsmarted you.
Did you show 'em those hand-to-hand killing techniques?<eos> Tomorrow. No!<eos> My child is not going to learn how to kill! I won't have it!<eos> Teaching them to kill to take their minds off dance?<eos> Have you heard anything more ridiculous?<eos> Perhaps you can talk about that with Istafan after the elections when things have calmed down a little When the children are more focused.<eos> After the election is too late.<eos> Andros... Your brother, Thanos, didn't leave because he found a job in Athens.<eos> He left because he didn't wanna be here.<eos> He hated this place... Hated what we made of it!
She fought our enemies, so I don't think we need to fear her.<eos> You've got to take me with you and teach me everything you know.<eos> Even in death, Gabrielle...,<eos> ...I will never leave you.<eos> ...you are the best thing that ever happened to me.<eos> You gave my life meaning and joy and you will be a part of me forever.<eos> That wailing I heard it before, a long time ago, when I was a child.<eos> An army from the east swept across the steppes.<eos> They destroyed everything in sight.<eos> It was led by a great warlord named Borias and her.
It's supportive of students who don't want to be judged by their looks.<eos> Oh, come on Daria.<eos> People like that don't exist.<eos> Jake, ask her why she can't be upbeat once in a while.<eos> You see, Helen, if this was supposed to be macaroni and cheese, it would be very bad.<eos> But it's penne a la pesto, and judged by the standards of penne a la pesto, it's very good.<eos> Jake, what the hell are you talking about?<eos> Are you listening? Of course, sure.<eos> What I mean is, if this poster is supposed to be propaganda promoting student life, it's very bad.<eos> But if it's supposed to be art expressing Daria's personal vision of student life, it's very good. See?
Yeah, Ray, it's all about you and how you couldn't¡¯t sleep.<eos> -Did you drink from this already? -No.<eos> -Well, the top didn't pop. -What?<eos> Did you check it at the supermarket?<eos> 'Cause the top was popped up already.<eos> It's fine, Ray.<eos> You got to check them when you buy them.<eos> Why don't you buy them? Then you can check them!<eos> Yeah, if I bought them, I wouldn't¡¯t buy one that had been tampered with.<eos> Nobody tampered with it.
For reasons beyond my control, I will soon become vapid, sluggish and slow-witted.<eos> So before that happens, I want to share some things with you that have meant a lot to me.<eos> What is she doir out there?<eos> I'll cut off her mike.<eos> No, no, no. Let her speak.<eos> I'm trying to get fired.<eos> And please don't deprive yourself of wonderful books like... To Kill a Mockingbird, Harriet the Spy and Yertle the Turtle... possibly the best book ever written on the subject of turtle stacking.<eos> She's got that right.<eos> Beauty is all around us, and not just in pageants and parlors.<eos> You can find it in the swirl of galaxies... or the swirl in the center of a sunflower.
The only sins I ever committed were on behalf of the Section.<eos> I'm only guilty of not taking charge of my own destiny.<eos> A fake obituary claimed I died in prison.<eos> In the end, that statement is true.<eos> Nikita?<eos> We have to talk.<eos> About what?<eos> I can't protect you anymore.<eos> I never asked for your protection.<eos> Without it, you'd be dead now.
You know, as in cooking dinner and serving it to your family.<eos> Well, in that case, thanks for getting rid of it, honey.<eos> Man, what I wouldn't give to play for the Chicago Bears.<eos> I would sell my soul to play for the Bears.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> I'm here to fix your television.<eos> Nothing wrong with my television.<eos> You know, my wife needs some fixing too.<eos> If you're a repairman, where's your butt crack?<eos> My tail's covering it.
In what way make it right?<eos> Art wants to try.<eos> Excuse me, Mrs Nesbitt.<eos> Have you seen that magazine before?<eos> No. lt's old.<eos> It looks...<eos> - ls it smut?<eos> - That copy is from 1978.<eos> You mentioned that's when you and your husband were married.<eos> We found it upstairs, clipped under the lid of the toilet tank in the master bathroom.
Turn 'em off! Your headlights. It'll take my eyes forever to readjust.<eos> What's so important you need to see out here?<eos> The comet, man. Look.<eos> Haven't you heard about it?<eos> Brother, if the Mariners didn't win, I don't bother with the news.<eos> Oh, man. You should hear about this.<eos> This is important.<eos> Why's that?<eos> Its scientific name is P/1997 Vansen-West.<eos> We discovered it about six months ago, but it's always been there.
Look, you want to sit on your collective thumbs, fine.<eos> I'm going to do my job.<eos> I won't allow you to compromise this situation.<eos> You're going to shoot me?<eos> Done.<eos> Drill bit cracked.<eos> -You got another one?<eos> -Yeah in my bag.<eos> -I'll get it.<eos> -No. No No. I'll get it.
We want prohibition! We want prohibition!<eos> You can't seriously want to ban alcohol.<eos> It tastes great, makes women appear more attractive and makes a person virtually invulnerable to criticism.<eos> Oh, won't somebody please think of the children?<eos> What kind of an example are we setting?<eos> All our founding fathers, astronauts and World Series heroes have been either drunk or on cocaine.<eos> Wait.<eos> Lookie here.<eos> Seems there's been a prohibition law on the books in Springfield for 200 years.<eos> - It's just never been enforced.
You're afraid to go because Frank Grimes will be there, aren't you?<eos> That's crazy talk.<eos> You're crazy, Marge.<eos> Get off the road.<eos> You'll have to face him sometime.<eos> And when you do, I'm sure he'll be just as anxious to make up as you are.<eos> - No, he won't.<eos> He hates me.<eos> - He doesn't hate you.<eos> He just feels insecure because you're getting through life so easily and it's been so difficult for him.
I suppose I'd best to run.<eos> Lord have mercy, I wish I weren't so fat.<eos> Police business!<eos> Hang on, son.<eos> I'm coming to...<eos> Jeez, my tongue.<eos> What do you suppose the rent is on a hideout like that?<eos> It's not rented, Chief. It's stolen.<eos> That's the Louisiana governor's mansion.<eos> It's been missing for eight months.
I hate this new timer.<eos> All of our landings have tanked ever since we started using that thing.<eos> I'll keep adjusting it till we find a landing we like. [Grunts]<eos> Or at least one we can survive.<eos> [Grunting] How long we here?<eos> Three days and change.<eos> [Panting] Hey, maybe it'll warm up, and we can catch a little sun and swim, huh?<eos> Uh, I wouldn't recommend it, Miss Wells.<eos> Of course.<eos> First time we slide to a beach, and it's closed. All right.
All you have to do is convince them to follow Cardassia's example.<eos> You expect us to join the Dominion?<eos> I expect you to behave rationally.<eos> Joining the Dominion will save billions of lives and keep the Federation from fading into the mists of history.<eos> By allowing it to exist under Dominion rule? No, thank you.<eos> I'm afraid you'll like the alternative even less.<eos> Dukat, if you have something to say to me, say it! Then I'll make it simple.<eos> A few days ago, I swore all Cardassia lost would be regained.<eos> That space station you're so fond of... was built by Cardassia.<eos> Funny, I thought it was built by Bajoran slave labor.
Launch the probe, Chief.<eos> It's time.<eos> Transfer helm control to autopilot.<eos> Autopilot engaged.<eos> Raise shields.<eos> We are breaking orbit.<eos> Coming around to 42 mark seven.<eos> I'm picking up an unusual temporal signature.<eos> It's the anomaly.<eos> We're headed straight for it.
The first time we faced off I remember thinking maybe I ought to take it easy on her.<eos> She ended up taking me down so hard it knocked the wind out of me.<eos> That was the last time I ever pulled a punch with her.<eos> She had this one-two combination... a feint to the right, a back-handed chop to the neck... faked me out every time.<eos> If that spoon-head gives me the chance maybe I'll just try that out on him.<eos> I think Stolzoff would've liked that.<eos> I can't get this loose.<eos> Get me the coil spanner, would you?<eos> What does it look like?<eos> It's got two pointy things on the end.
Engine Room, Bridge. Set course 050 mark 179.<eos> Unlock safeties on torpedoes three and four.<eos> Can't you see what's happening to you?<eos> You're going against everything you claim to believe in. And for what? To satisfy a personal vendetta?<eos> You betrayed your uniform!<eos> And you're betraying yours, right now.<eos> The sad part is, you don't even realize it.<eos> I feel sorry for you, Captain.<eos> This obsession with me...<eos> look what it's cost you.
That's two.<eos> That's two.<eos> That's two.<eos> That's two.<eos> That's two.<eos> Hello, Major.<eos> I was just about to call you.<eos> Quark, what is that?<eos> I just found this padd in a shipment of Saurian brandy I just received.<eos> It was coded for you but somehow, I accidentally activated it.
How could I be your friend?<eos> I don't know you.<eos> tell me what you do remember.<eos> Uh, people around me, crowded around me.<eos> You... a boy... a young girl.<eos> I was in a chamber... a bio-temporaI chamber.<eos> Good.<eos> I was inside it and you told someone to activate it.<eos> I'm afraid you're confused.<eos> I discussed the bio-temporaI chamber with you, but we're not ready to put you inside it just yet.
Could you be mistaken?<eos> It's you who are mistaken, Minister.<eos> What?<eos> You accuse Gegen of having his objectivity clouded by... wishful thinking, but aren't you guilty of the same charge?<eos> I am not on trial here.<eos> I understand, but, in a way, your beliefs are.<eos> How you think about yourselves, your place in the universe-- that is on trial and this isn't the first time.<eos> What do you mean? I've had the opportunity over the last few days to learn something about your culture-- your great accomplishments.<eos> Consider the breakthrough into transwarp.<eos> An incredible achievement, and yet, your ancient Doctrine predicted terrible disasters if it were even attempted.
Speak for yourself.<eos> We're starting to receive telemetry.<eos> Captain, this is one weird disturbance.<eos> I'm reading a temperature gradient of nine million kelvins, massive discharges of plasmatic energy and there's a perfectly calm eye at the center.<eos> Apparently, some of the matter inside it is being exchanged between space and subspace.<eos> What about the plasma? Is there any way we can transfer some of it to Voyager?<eos> I don't see how. We can't transport with this kind of turbulence. Maybe we could try a...<eos> We lost it.<eos> Where's the probe?<eos> It's disappeared. It's still transmitting, but there's a lot of interference.
But you consider yourselves under orders to use better judgment about it.<eos> Is that understood?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> - Yes, Captain.<eos> Dismissed.<eos> Computer, hot coffee--black.<eos> Commander Chakotay is suffering bone decalcification, tissue necrosis, decreased visual acuity-- all classic signs of aging-- but they've developed within hours.<eos> Any theories?<eos> There's a rare genetic disorder called progeria, which causes children to age prematurely.<eos> But there's never been an adult case and it was supposedly eradicated two centuries ago.
It's also called Dostoevsky's Syndrome because the novelist suffered from it too.<eos> What was I doing there and why didn't I do anything to stop it?<eos> I can't explain that.<eos> I've arranged for your arraignment in one hour.<eos> By then Detective Curtis and I will have enough forensics data for your release.<eos> I still need to know why though.<eos> This is the office of the psychologist that treated Amy.<eos> - Have you been here before?<eos> - I don't know, but we found my car.<eos> It's been here for a few days.
I don't understand.<eos> Just an hour ago you said that she was getting better.<eos> That's right.<eos> Her fever's down.<eos> Her vital signs are nearly back to normal.<eos> But these latest MRls are telling me that this growth has continued to spread.<eos> In her arms I'm now seeing what looks like a necrotizing of the tissue.<eos> It's killing her.<eos> Whatever it is, it may have already been present in some amount.<eos> Basically, it's shut down her body while it continues to grow.
They're all dead.<eos> They've been shot.<eos> Babcock.<eos> The body.<eos> It's gone.<eos> They took it.<eos> No one knew.<eos> We didn't tell a soul.<eos> They had radio communication.<eos> Maybe it was being monitored.
You got me, Mulder.<eos> You know, maybe none.<eos> It appears atrophied.<eos> although it may look that way as a result of the mummification.<eos> Could this be a "like father, Iike son" kind of a thing?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Could Eddie Junior have the same anomalous muscular structure as his dad here?<eos> Maybe.<eos> What are you suggesting?<eos> If this musculature underlies the entire skin, maybe it could be utilized to remold the skin's shape and texture.
Unless you can explain how he knew when and how Lucas Menand would be killed, why Nichols' fingerprints were inside that patrol car, and how he knew Ianelli's secret.<eos> So what you're saying is the old man is...<eos> Jason Nichols.<eos> "Common sense may rule out time travel. The laws of quantum physics do not."<eos> That's from your graduate thesis.<eos> You were more open-minded as a youngster.<eos> I know that the laws of physics would permit the theoretical possibility of time travel, but the limits of human endurance would prevent such a trip happening.<eos> - There's one way to prove that possibility.<eos> - How?<eos> Show this photo to Lisa Ianelli and ask her if it was ever taken.
Hey, lady.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Come here-- come here.<eos> I want to tell you this!<eos> Ephiny!<eos> Go downriver.<eos> Find Xena's sarcophagus.<eos> Bring it to the hall of ambrosia.<eos> Here's a map.<eos> I can find my way without it.
What is it with this family?<eos> Brittany, Charles.<eos> You're up.<eos> We started with... Shut up, Charles.<eos> Brittany, did you go with negative or positive reinforcement?<eos> Um... negative?<eos> I mean... positive?<eos> Charles, shut your miserable, lying, cheating mouth.<eos> Brittany, continue.<eos> The mouse, um... it's supposed to run down the path.
Afternoon.<eos> Uh, let's get started.<eos> You see this ball ?<eos> - I don't see nothin'.<eos> - Well, I do.<eos> It's a good ball.<eos> Regulation weight, size.<eos> A little worn, but still has a nice bounce to it.<eos> Don't-<eos> - Don't hang on to it, Josh.
just like the way it was with my feeling for my son.<eos> -Is something wrong with Mitya? There was no surprise about this, either.<eos> -What's going on?<eos> -Mitya wants to see you.<eos> But be it faith or not.<eos> I don't Know what it is.<eos> Through suffering, this feeling has crept just as imperceptibly into my heart. He knows me.<eos> and has lodged itself firmly there.<eos> I shall still be unable to understand with my reason why I pray, and I shall still go on praying.<eos> But my life now... my whole life... independent of anything that can happen to me, every minute of it is no longer meaningless as it was before, but has a positive meaning of goodness with which I have the power to invest it.
- I appreciate it.<eos> It's a mansion on a hill.<eos> - Praise the Lord.<eos> It's yours.<eos> Dear Father in heaven, we thank you for this food that we're about to receive.<eos> Amen.<eos> Glory.<eos> I feel as if I have crucified Christ afresh in what I have done.<eos> Adultery is a demonic oppression.<eos> As we seek the deliverance needed from such iniquity I know that never will I be touched or weakened by it again.
- And where exactly is it?<eos> Heaven knows.<eos> It's clearing up.<eos> So, you were saying... the key that always makes you say yes, has to come from heaven.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'll give it a try.<eos> If the Virgin Mary tosses it down to me...<eos> You never know.<eos> Mary, the key!<eos> Is this it?
And I'll learn to pray to make it happen.<eos> What I want is for you to feel as useless<eos> as an empty whisky glass in someone's hands.<eos> And I want the heart in your breast<eos> to feel as if it belonged to someone else, and for it to hurt.<eos> I wish you death wherever you are.<eos> And I'll learn to pray to make it happen.<eos> Dear son, I've got cancer.<eos> I won't last until you get out of jail.<eos> I'm leaving you the house, if it isn't demolished first, and my savings, if this disease doesn't eat them up.
Don't forget to plug the annual, and don't mention the TV show, okay?<eos> Call me if you get bored.<eos> Explain this again.<eos> How could you have grown up on the shore and never played skee-ball?<eos> What did you do with your youth?<eos> Stayed out late, smoked pot, screwed around.<eos> Not your grade school years, your high school years.<eos> - This looks complicated. - Jesus. Potzer, uh...<eos> - The premise is very basic, okay? - Uh-huh.<eos> You roll the ball up the rampart in an effort to pop it into the score circle.
The sneakers will get wet.<eos> I'm afraid to go to the courtyard.<eos> Excuse me, ma'am, what time is it?<eos> There is still time to write, go on.<eos> Excuse me ma'am, can I leave now?<eos> Why are you in a hurry?<eos> You may go.<eos> What is it, dear?<eos> Why are you sitting here?<eos> My shoe fell in the stream, it's stuck under the bridge.
I was screaming, I was kicking,<eos> I was doing everything I could to stop him but I couldn't.<eos> So I grabbed a knife and I cut his dick off.<eos> Yeah, there was blood everywhere.<eos> She cut the guy's dick off?<eos> That's what she says. Jim:<eos> Well, there's a vanishing image of Hong Kong for you. Hey what is that red thing in the background with that face on it?<eos> That's a face map.<eos> They use it for telling fortunes here.<eos> They believe that a map of the face is a map of a life, that you can read everything in it.
And Cassiopeia A gives off a whole lot of radio signals.<eos> I listen to them a lot.<eos> It's a remnant of a supernova.<eos> When did you know you wanted to be an astronomer?<eos> When I was about eight years old watching the sunset I asked Dad, "What's that bright star over there?"<eos> He said that it wasn't a star.<eos> It was a whole planet called Venus which should be over there soon.<eos> He said, "You know why they called it Venus?<eos> Because they thought it was so beautiful and glowing.<eos> But they didn't know that it's filled with deadly gases and sulfuric acid rain."
- No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Let me tell you something, friend.<eos> Violence is bigger than ever.<eos> You see, little baby white girls be piercing every floppy piece of skin they got, creaming to every flavor of gangsta.<eos> Pretty soon records just gonna have the sound of gunshots on 'em.<eos> Everywhere you look, billboards got some movie star holding some big-ass gun.<eos> Let me tell you something, motherfucker.<eos> Violence rules, man.<eos> Violence is flip.<eos> You don't like it, run with the nuns, but it is here, it is now, and Six is on it.
Making a living was never a real problem for me.<eos> The problem was all I see is misery and darkness.<eos> Die, die, die.<eos> I'll put a gun to my fucking head right now.<eos> I'm so pissed I could kill you, but I'm not going to.<eos> Life is beautiful.<eos> Really it is.<eos> Full of beauty and illusions.<eos> Life is great.<eos> Without it, you'd be dead.
Would you believe they sent me so many boxes to taunt me?<eos> Dr Jenner writes that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state, and yet they continue to hound me with box after box... after box after box after box.<eos> I wish to take the princesses for a swim.<eos> The turns I have been taking in the grounds have proved most beneficial to me, and Brown thinks saltwater will do me good.<eos> Don't putter, children.<eos> Swim!<eos> You could buy that lot for garden ornaments... and still get change from ten guineas.<eos> Lift your foot, woman!<eos> [Brown] Walk on. [Clicks Tongue]<eos> [Man] This nation is fortunate... insomuch as it is not governed by force... but by a chain of traditions... that have been cherished from generation to generation.
Where'd you find that girl in that stunning gown?<eos> Well, if it isn't God's lonely man.<eos> A real high roller, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> Don't get me wrong. I love a guy who's willing to take a chance.<eos> How are they treating you?<eos> Braxton's the genius.<eos> He bought the setup all the way?<eos> Sucker born every minute.<eos> Can I ask you a question if it ain't too personal?<eos> Well, if it is, I won't answer it.
Thanks. Shit!<eos> No problem.<eos> Exactly as you predicted.<eos> "Quick - drive my car." Here's 40 dollars.<eos> If you don't mind me asking, how did you know he'd react like that?<eos> It's our job to know.<eos> You've done this before?<eos> Let's go!<eos> You can take the car.<eos> But remember... it's stolen.
She was a great taker of pills.<eos> # Oh, is it any wonder... The last dose I had tried had knocked her out for four hours.<eos> But that was not enough to guarantee me an undisturbed night.<eos> Hum...<eos> At last!<eos> I think I must be immune.<eos> What would you give me if you wanted to uh... ..to knock out... ..say, a cow?<eos> J - Just for... seven or eight hours.<eos> So that... ..you know, the cow... would stay asleep?<eos> Even if you were tossing and turning next to it.
- If we can get... this car moving, we might be able to make it.<eos> What...<eos> What do you mean, might?<eos> I mean, probably.<eos> But even if they do... this thing's been down here rotting for half a century.<eos> - How do you know it'll move?<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> Listen.<eos> This car is a CR-17 from Coney Island.<eos> Believe me, it was made to last.
So this bloke's got the hump thinking Billy's been giving her one.<eos> He's got nothing to lose.<eos> He's up for another nine years.<eos> It's nothing for him to kill someone, so he done Billy on the exercise yard... for the bird, not the thing with Danny.<eos> It's got nothing to do with that, it's the other thing.<eos> So he's done him with a knife, a Stanley knife.<eos> What amazes me is, how'd they get the things in there in the first place?<eos> What's the geezer doing with a knife in the nick?<eos> No, it was a moody thing, you know?<eos> It was like a toothbrush with Bic razorblades bound around it, see?
I was trying to make peace in the lamest way.<eos> I said, "She's not naked.<eos> It's art."<eos> And he started hitting me.<eos> He beat me unconscious.<eos> And he talked to me less and less.<eos> He knew what I was before I did.<eos> The morning I left for college he walked into my room.<eos> He held out his hand.<eos> And it was filled with money.
Give me your hand.<eos> You cannot stop this.<eos> Never.<eos> OK, just just stay still.<eos> Stay still.<eos> You don't want to die like this.<eos> Tell me about the bomb.<eos> Is it on a trigger?<eos> Is it on a timer?<eos> Is it activated?
I wasn't fair to you.<eos> This is not a dream.<eos> -That flower, where does it come from?<eos> -We're going to church now.<eos> To say goodbye to mummy.<eos> Look at you.<eos> What have you done to yourself?<eos> People of Burkinwell Parish.<eos> We are all of us here, a footfall all away from death.<eos> Do not think of death as a distant country ... for it is as quickly found as the blink of a man's eye.
God only helps those who shift their arses!<eos> Will you join our number, Mr. Castle?<eos> Nine men now ... where once there were twice that number.<eos> Are you going to turn our woods into a laboratory?<eos> You can't capture God with a camera.<eos> It's not God I'm looking for.<eos> It's not proof you need, it's faith.<eos> Tell me about your faith.<eos> Faith... is what a man must live by.<eos> Sometimes a man can hide behind it.
Help us find a file marked 'Surveyor' and underlined in blue.<eos> So, these assistants are a burden for you.<eos> Nevertheless they are yours.<eos> They were affected to me here.<eos> You mean - assigned.<eos> As if by chance:<eos> absurd allocation!<eos> With us, nothing is absurd.<eos> What about my assignement?<eos> It was conceived after much reflection, but it got complicated.
She looked at him as if she did not know him.<eos> She carried a platter of empty dishes.<eos> He ran over to her, took her by the shoulders as if to resume possession, and asked her harmless questions while watching her in the eyes.<eos> But she was emotionless, playing absent-mindedly with her platter, and then she said:<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Go back to ...<eos> You know what I want to say.<eos> You were seen leaving their place.<eos> I believed that you worked at the counter.<eos> She looked at him surprised, and caressed his cheek as if to engrain it in her memory.
What happened?<eos> It's O.K.<eos> It's me, Smilla.<eos> Isaiah.<eos> Smilla?<eos> How did you find me?<eos> It wasn't hard.<eos> You're considered the best ear in Copenhagen.<eos> You called about a tape.<eos> It was left next to an electrical box.
Aquilluqqag.<eos> It's wet, wet snow.<eos> It's not firm enough to build a snow house with.<eos> You must never use it for that.<eos> I won't.<eos> Promise me?<eos> I promise.<eos> More. Come on, more.<eos> Did you hear the tape?<eos> They killed Isaiah for it.
How many drug dealers are there in this state, Curtis?<eos> How many do you think will get ripped off today?<eos> And how many of them will have a fucking undercover cop in their fucking office?<eos> ! The odds must be a billion to one.<eos> I need a computer to figure it out.<eos> Are you finished yet?<eos> - Dump the car.<eos> - She's right, Curtis.<eos> This was my daddy's car.<eos> It's got a 350 bored out to a 386.

Marcus, you want a beer?<eos> Yeah, just get me one.<eos> - Gordo?<eos> - Fine.<eos> What the fuck are you doing?<eos> You think this is cool?<eos> No.<eos> - Why are you kissing everybody's ass?<eos> - I'm not.<eos> People like you look at this life and you think it's got a power, because it says "fuck you".
You?<eos> I come from many countries.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> How's that?<eos> I travel the world.<eos> Doing what?<eos> A sort of personal quest.<eos> Oh. That's cool.<eos> I love this city.<eos> It's so elegantly decayed.
Who is your master?<eos> I killed my master.<eos> Let us strike a bargain, Zachary, in our mutual best interests.<eos> I will give you sanctuary, a willing consort to feast upon this one night.<eos> Tomorrow, you must leave here and never look back.<eos> If you agree to that, I'll let you see Sofia.<eos> All right. I agree.<eos> This is the largest underground stronghold in Eastern Europe.<eos> 80 feet beneath the city are labyrinth caves with a dozen secret exits.<eos> It was renovated in the 18th century by my predecessor and master, Radu of Transylvania.
I'm done!<eos> - Whoa!<eos> - Where the...<eos> My God.<eos> This is just an incredible scene.<eos> We are watching a stampede desperately...<eos> Someone...<eos> Some...<eos> My leg.<eos> I think it's busted.
Yes, hold on<eos> Excuse me<eos> Can he phone me here at your place in an hour or two?<eos> I have no choice<eos> The number?<eos> It's on the phone<eos> I'm causing you a lot of trouble<eos> You weren't to know<eos> In the meantime I'll make that police report<eos> The car may never be found so I may as well say it was parked in a street
Well s? r.<eos> If you allow, I would like to pose to you some questions.<eos> All that you will want.<eos> Is the press interested more? the accident, the workman of the crane...<eos> This drunk pig.<eos> qu '? the statue it-m? me.<eos> Was it encrusted with stones?<eos> Without ornament.<eos> Like Ahura Mazda.<eos> It was made apr? s conversion? the Islam.
Thank you.<eos> You know why?<eos> It was understated.<eos> You got lucky with the rain, too.<eos> We had to divert the plane to Boca Raton.<eos> You should have come to me.<eos> We have rain machines.<eos> I'm a producer. I make rain.<eos> Next time.<eos> I have just gotten word... that the situation in Albania is resolved... that it is resolved.
We were told that they had no books here. That it wasn't even ordered.<eos> WOMAN: Seriously?<eos> - Yeah. - Told by who?<eos> Somebody down the street there at Media Play.<eos> You can't always believe everything you hear. MOORE:<eos> Last time we send people down there, huh?<eos> Number three... Rick from Cheap Trick is not in town. PAT:<eos> Here's something you might know. It's three chords.<eos> * Do, do, do, do * You wrote a song, you know.<eos> Too bad the Yardbirds already did it.
- It's a bunch of bullshit.<eos> If you have silicone breast implants and are experiencing these symptoms... please call 1-800-RUPTURE.<eos> - A lot of girls say they're getting sick.<eos> - Did you talk to them?<eos> I'm not a doctor.<eos> I know you're not a doctor.<eos> Did you explain to them?<eos> - I didn't explain.<eos> All I know...<eos> - Even if there's a leak, it gets trapped.
There he is!<eos> I've been waiting, Shinji.<eos> Kaoru!<eos> Asuka, I'm sorry.<eos> The Eva series was born from Adam. And yet the Lilin will utilize that... which they hate most of all in order to survive.<eos> I do not understand.<eos> Kaoru!<eos> Stop! Why? !<eos> Your Eva's and I are composed of the same matter.<eos> Born from Adam, I can synchronize with it easily... as long as there is no dominant soul, and Unit 02's soul is now hiding itself.
However in males, we see two slits directly in line with the stomach, one is the anus and the other is the orifice of the penis, it's a bit like a zipper.<eos> For better hydrodynamics, the penis is hidden in the belly.<eos> And when the whale is flirting and amorous, well at that time, you can see his penis come out.<eos> Did you see that by chance today? -Yes, it was quite big and it hung down, it was a bit pointed, it hung down, and it was a bit brownish pink...<eos> Yes, these whales are on their breeding grounds, so they're flirting, so we have all the love play of the new whales.<eos> The next day, the weather is better, we decide to raise the anchor.<eos> And first, like every morning, after the sailors get washed, we must do the ship.<eos> We must always work, in fact, we're exploited children, as you can see...<eos> This morning, the coral reefs of the Silver Bank gives us a nasty surprise, it's impossible to raise the anchor.<eos> The anchor weighs 150 kg and the chain weighs 1 tonne, so when on top of that, it's wedged at the bottom, it's very difficult to raise.
- Still, maybe the famous tenor?<eos> - Still, maybe the intelligent lady?<eos> I thought you were a man [a woman] of the present, assumed that your marriage was modern, took it for granted you would put no trouble in each other's way.<eos> Can it be true that you're content with<eos> -this charmless woman? -this boring fellow?<eos> You who are intended to make<eos> -so many women happy. - so many men happy.<eos> You can be satisfied with one only?<eos> Which today nobody would dream of.<eos> Cancel at once this crippling connection, or compel it to leave you free.
You violated orders.<eos> Why?<eos> The people are no threat.<eos> They should be left alone.<eos> - That's not up to you.<eos> - With all due respect,... ..if I'd come back and reported the gate was still intact,... ..we would've sent another bomb, just like you were about to.<eos> It wasn't necessary for them to die.<eos> The threat from Ra was gone.<eos> What about the probe we sent?<eos> It was crushed.
Which is why I can only afford to give you a skeleton crew, enough to get you inside.<eos> - Then you're on your own.<eos> - You can't...<eos> Yes, I can!<eos> We're up to our eyes in troops around here, Stephen... and I'm not risking any more on this than I have to.<eos> If you have a problem with that you can go somewhere else, but that's my final offer.<eos> Delenn!<eos> Thank Valen I found you before you left.<eos> Ambassador Mollari convened a meeting of the League of Non-Aligned Worlds.<eos> - And it's already started.
- It isn't?<eos> - No.<eos> And how do you know that?<eos> When you came in before, I saw daylight through the door.<eos> When you came in now it's dark outside.<eos> Daylight?<eos> You mean that?<eos> Well, if that's daylight and that's night, then we may as well assume that this is morning again.<eos> Good morning.<eos> I'd forget my head if it wasn't nailed on.
They look to us to guide their hands.<eos> But prayers are fleeting and wars forgotten.<eos> What is built endures.<eos> They do not wish to conquer or convert, only to build the future.<eos> And now they will have that chance.<eos> The Religious caste and the Warrior caste will advise and counsel.<eos> We will serve, as is proper.<eos> Religion and war must act in the service of the people not the other way around.<eos> And this place...<eos> This place is reserved in memory of Neroon until the day it is taken by The One who is to come.
If this is the way he is after Delenn's been gone for three days I don't even wanna know what he's gonna be like after another week.<eos> Lennier, have you been able to get through to home yet?<eos> It's been difficult.<eos> It seems the primary beacon is no longer transmitting.<eos> I've had to use the orbital relay station to pick up on local broadcasts.<eos> Delenn, fighting has broken out in the capital.<eos> They fear it may spread to the outer cities.<eos> Civil war.<eos> Yes.<eos> It's started.
What kind of sympathy are you gonna get by killing innocent people in cold blood?<eos> You wanna send out a message, this ain't it.<eos> Look, I can work with you.<eos> I can get you out of this, but you've gotta work with me.<eos> What do you say?<eos> That's what I thought you were gonna say.<eos> This is President Sheridan.<eos> I have consulted with Captain Lochley and we've reached a decision regarding the current situation.<eos> It is not the policy of the Interstellar Alliance or this station to bargain with terrorists for the lives of hostages.<eos> If we open that door even once we will never be able to close it again.
The Shadows had come to Babylon 5 and Sheridan had gone to Z'Ha'Dum.<eos> - So why don't you just kill me?<eos> - It doesn't work.<eos> Somebody'd just come around and replace you.<eos> They knew there were three people who could replace him:<eos> Delenn, Ivanova and you.<eos> Given your checkered background they thought you would be the easiest to turn to their side.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Once Sheridan was dead Ivanova and Delenn would be eliminated.<eos> They left the station intact on the theory that it could be used for their purposes.
Did they have orthodontists?<eos> Rodney looked like he had been dead for 500 years.<eos> How could that be?<eos> Maybe we should ask that crazy man with the big old knife.<eos> I don't think he seemed overly chatty.<eos> The way he bolted when he saw Rodney, I'd say he was as freaked as we were.<eos> My resources on the subject are limited.<eos> I gather this mummy was from the Sabancaya region of eastern Peru.<eos> It's very remote.<eos> - If there's an answer, then it's locked in...
Not love, not hate. Fear!<eos> When you were a mortal boy, what did you fear?<eos> Monsters.<eos> We are defined by the things we fear.<eos> This symbol, these two planks of wood,<eos> it confounds me.<eos> Suffuses me with mortal dread.<eos> But fear is in the mind.<eos> I like pain.<eos> It can be controlled.
What is it?<eos> Some night, huh?<eos> Hey, you really know how to woo a girl back, don't ya?<eos> Hospital.<eos> I think I could use a drink.<eos> Uh, to celebrate.<eos> - We should probably be hitting the road.<eos> - Hitting the road?<eos> You'll love the house.<eos> It's furnished just the way you like it.
- This mark's like a homing beacon.<eos> - It's OK.<eos> I'm not into running.<eos> - Aren't we manly?<eos> - One of us is.<eos> You're gonna hide till it's over.<eos> - Excellent plan.<eos> - Is there a way into the back?<eos> There's a back door.<eos> It's locked. I think it's solid.
Nope.<eos> Must be in the handbook, after the chapter on personality removal.<eos> - Be careful with that thing.<eos> - Please. I'm an expert in all weapons.<eos> - Is everything all right?<eos> - Yeah, it's OK.<eos> - Kendra killed the bad lamp.<eos> - Sorry!<eos> This, uh... trigger mechanism is different.<eos> Perhaps when this is over, you can show me how to work it.
- So, you fight any demons this summer?<eos> - Yes, our own personal demons.<eos> - Such as lust and thrift.<eos> - I would have to go with "Stooges" also.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm talking about big demons that came from the ground.<eos> Remember? Prom night?<eos> With all the vampires.<eos> Cordelia, your mouth is open.<eos> Sound is coming from it.
But you came.<eos> It doesn't change things.<eos> It shows that you loved your father.<eos> - I have to go now.<eos> Take care.<eos> Come on.<eos> I always wanted a pocket watch.<eos> I don't know if I'd use it, but I like the idea of it.<eos> An heirloom to pass on from generation to generation.<eos> I don't think Rachel would be excited about it.
They'll go easier on you.<eos> You've never killed before.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - You haven't, have you?<eos> Duncan, what the hell's taking so long?<eos> Come on.<eos> You've got to start working with me.<eos> Hey! It's me, Javier.<eos> Quiet, quiet.<eos> There's a door behind me, but it's locked.
- Tell Hicks that I-<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Go. Go!<eos> I knew you'd come back.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Something to make you feel normal.<eos> I don't want to feel normal.<eos> No, don't run away from it.<eos> Don't run away from the fear.<eos> I know how to deal with it.
- In the hospital.<eos> - Oh, no. - Should we call someone?<eos> Husband?<eos> We found these pictures in your car.<eos> Is she your daughter?<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - I killed her.<eos> - How're you feeling, Mr. Bartok?<eos> - Like after my second heart attack.<eos> What you're having is a lot like it, except to your gut.

I've already got that figured out.<eos> I'm sure you have.<eos> See you later.<eos> Congratulations!<eos> For what? Da'an agreed with your recommendation.<eos> What recommendation?<eos> Ms. Payton is to undergo the Taelon limb restoration.<eos> I didn't recommend her.<eos> Did you say "limb restoration"?<eos> Yes. It's been in the experimental stages for quite some time, now Boone is to be part of its public debut.
Happy, you know....<eos> These are beautiful.<eos> I cried, too.<eos> Roses are twice as much on Valentine's Day.<eos> Listen, Ray... I have something to tell you.<eos> I've looked everywhere, but I.... I think I've lost my engagement ring.<eos> All right, don't worry.<eos> I'm sure it will turn up.<eos> Did you look in the sofa?<eos> I don't think I'm going to find it.
Listen, we have to be realistic, okay?<eos> The ring is gone.<eos> All right?<eos> Listen.<eos> You made a mistake, that's all.<eos> Everybody makes a mistake.<eos> You know, you're lucky... 'cause you're married to a guy who doesn't care about those things.<eos> Don't lift that cushion.<eos> Stop torturing yourself!<eos> It's gone, that's all. Look....
-Yes, I am.<eos> Look, I'm fine. Watch.<eos> Look at that.<eos> You've got to go to a doctor, okay?<eos> I have to get ready and go to a dinner at my boss's house.<eos> There's people there that I have to meet.<eos> I'm sure you'll make a great impression. "Hi, I'm Rachel.<eos> It's nice to meet you. "<eos> Come on, you probably have a broken rib.<eos> I'll go to the hospital tomorrow. It'll still be broken then.
Lee, you clean out the cabin.<eos> And make sure you don't miss anything.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> I think his keys are still in his pocket.<eos> Good move, jackass.<eos> Well, don't just stand there. Get them out.<eos> Hey there.<eos> Howdy.<eos> - Is that your cabin back there?<eos> - No, I think it's abandoned.
Well, Richard, I love litigation.<eos> But right now I work on a case-by-case basis.<eos> I deal with individuals, not with the law.<eos> Now, I know you're preparing to argue a right-to-life case before the Supreme Court.<eos> What you say may change the law.<eos> I wanna be a part of that.<eos> I wanna make a difference.<eos> The partners and I agree, you would be a great addition to our firm.<eos> And that is why we are prepared now to make you this offer.<eos> Well, go ahead, open it. It's not booby-trapped.
He researched her.<eos> He knows about the Section.<eos> Oh, no, now, why do we need him?<eos> Just when we were having such fun, the two of us.<eos> - Yes, 10 CC's.<eos> - No, no, please. Don't do this, don't do this!<eos> This information is very complicated.<eos> Names, numbers... I won't be able to remember it if you-!<eos> That tightening and that pain that you feel in your chest will only get worse.<eos> - It's caused by-
I've got something for you.<eos> - What do you got for me, Yankee?<eos> - I'll meet you by the gate.<eos> - Right now. All right?<eos> - Tell me what you got now.<eos> - I've got informa...<eos> - I've got a letter to be mailed, sir.<eos> I'm told it takes 2 greenbacks.<eos> Can you help me out?<eos> Is it unsealed?
- That belongs to the school.<eos> - lt's supposed to be in the AV room.<eos> Get back here!<eos> Beavis and Butt-head, you're both expelled!<eos> Check it out, Beavis.<eos> I didn't know Anderson had a camper.<eos> Maybe it has a TV.<eos> Are you boys here to look at the refrigerator?<eos> - We're here to look at the TV.<eos> Tom didn't tell me it was broken.
No, he didn't take any clothes or food. I'm almost sure, Ben.<eos> Maybe he doesn't think he'll need them. Maybe he's gonna drive that thing straight into a tree.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> No, that can't be true.<eos> Ben, Carolyn, I think you better come with me.<eos> Do they know?<eos> Oh, Jake. Were you running to some...<eos> No, I came down here to tell 'em the truth. Everything. Just like I told you.<eos> But you won't believe this. It turns out that it's not that easy.<eos> Even if you really want to, it turns out that my statement isn't legal unless it's signed by my parents.
I don't know.<eos> I lose my touch, man.<eos> Did you ever have a touch to lose, man?<eos> What were you doing in there?<eos> Let's go!<eos> - Wait for Kumar.<eos> - Come on, Kumar!<eos> Hurry up, Kumar!<eos> - Open your door.<eos> - I can't. It's locked.
The only difference is, I can fuck someone I've just met.<eos> But to steal, I need to know someone like I know myself.<eos> You think you know me like that?<eos> I wanna see the money.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Don't worry. It ain't mine.<eos> - Caesar, what happened?<eos> Un-fuckin'-believable!<eos> Look at this shirt.<eos> Look at it. It's ruined.
It goes on last.<eos> Start her up.<eos> Pump the gas once when I say go.<eos> Look at that! You're a goddamn wizard, Al!<eos> All right. Turn it off now.<eos> I got a customer, Al.<eos> Be right back.<eos> What do you got for me?<eos> I got this beauty here, man. Check it out.<eos> What do you think? Man! it's got a nice set of forelegs.
Hey, no problem.<eos> We just...<eos> Oh, Jeez...<eos> Any sign of Deakins?<eos> Maybe the son of a bitch is dead.<eos> What a terrible thing to say!<eos> Get 'em.<eos> You assured me everything would go smoothly!<eos> It is going smoothly, I assure you.<eos> Our merchandise is not where it's supposed to be!
We're running out of time.<eos> We have polluted and peopled this planet to the brink of extinction.<eos> We are destroying our world at a suicidal pace.<eos> We need a pollution revolution.<eos> And it's not going to be easy because the world is addicted to petroleum.<eos> We have limited resources and we go to war to protect them.<eos> We need a new technology and this technology can't be sold.<eos> It must be given away to everyone.
These are gloomy for it.<eos> I think you must wish to know why.<eos> Mr. Cheever.<eos> Have warrants drawn for all of these.<eos> Arrest for examination.<eos> - They've done no wrong.<eos> - I have brought trouble on these people.<eos> Not if they are of good conscience, Mr. Nurse.<eos> You misunderstand, sir.<eos> A person is either with this court or against it.
- Yeah, I fed it to Barney just a second ago.<eos> Right over there.<eos> Get away!<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Get off!<eos> Wait!<eos> Marvellous catch!<eos> Listen.<eos> Let's say somebody accidentally mails a letter but it's in the building...<eos> Once it's mailed, it's gone.
You sound like one who tried.<eos> And failed.<eos> So I no longer try to change the world, Dragon. I just try to get by in it.<eos> Yes, it's better than death, I suppose.<eos> Oh, is it?<eos> I should think you'd welcome death.<eos> You know, the last of your kind, all your friends dead, hunted wherever you go.<eos> Do you delight in reminding me?<eos> Yes, Knight, I do long for death.<eos> But fear it.
I had the most pleasing letter from him on the occasion of our marriage.<eos> I have it here if anyone would care to see it.<eos> A most charming and kindly letter.<eos> Don't you think so, Mother?<eos> Have, have you ever read such a letter, Mr. Knightley?<eos> Do you know, this... this reminds me of Jane's style somewhat.<eos> It's a very delicate style which is more usual in a woman, but a good sign in a man, I think.<eos> Nicely expressed.<eos> But it sounds as though he eats a worrisome amount of custard.<eos> It's not merely the feeling in it. The penmanship is so confident.
Why else would I go to London to have your picture framed?<eos> Allow me to-<eos> Allow me to interpret the silence.<eos> You have long understood me.<eos> Sit back and kindly refrain from the intimacy of whispering!<eos> Am I to understand that you never sought to recommend yourself to Miss Smith?<eos> How can you be surprised?<eos> Did you not understand the riddle I wrote?<eos> That was for Harriet!<eos> I most obviously did not address it to her, and left it at your home.
- Curly, what do you want?<eos> - "I've been thinking it over."<eos> You know, in life, life just... What do you want?<eos> I want you to hit a home run for me, Bob.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Remember that kid in chemo whose life was unfair to him?<eos> That's how I'm feeling. My life has been unfair to me.<eos> The only difference is, I'll be able to see you hit that home run tomorrow.<eos> And I got a photo here. I'm gonna get it to you.<eos> And I want you to put it on the Jumbotron, okay?
- Half a share.<eos> - A whole one, I.<eos> For thou dost know, O Damon dear this realm dismantled was of Jove himself and now reigns here a very, very peacock.<eos> You might have rhymed.<eos> O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand pound.<eos> - Didst perceive? - Very well, my lord.<eos> Upon the talk of the poisoning?<eos> I did very well note him.<eos> Come, some music, come, the recorders.<eos> For if the king like not the comedy, why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
- No more games.<eos> - Jack!<eos> - Mommy!<eos> You go play with your dog, you bastard!<eos> The boy lived.<eos> He carried the bloodline, the guilt for what our family had begun.<eos> And how to undo it.<eos> Did he carry that too?<eos> Yes.<eos> It was passed down through the generations.
Open up!<eos> Well, I'm through here.<eos> I'll be in touch in a week or two.<eos> Zorro! Come here!<eos> Come here, I said!<eos> Come here. Heel!<eos> -Hello.<eos> You were a long time.<eos> What's this building?<eos> The army built it during the war.
Be merry while you can.<eos> Waiter!<eos> Bring the bottle.<eos> My friend and superior here pays.<eos> Without those you'll get no dough.<eos> - No I won't, and I don't want to.<eos> Who'll pay the rent, and the bills?<eos> With what?<eos> - I'll sell the car.<eos> You won't get anything for it.
I always wondered what you mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.<eos> Sam!<eos> Partner.<eos> You caught me playing hooky.<eos> Floating around out here, playing hell with them bass.<eos> Sounds great!<eos> Where do I sign up?<eos> You been by your old place lately?<eos> No.<eos> New people painted it some awful color.
My own experience was in the fields in Michigan, where I was raised on a farm and an uncle, who was a Northern guy, black Northern guy came out of the field one day and started narrating Antony's speech, the funeral oration.<eos> - From Shakespeare's Julius Caesar?<eos> We'd heard stuff from the Bible but my first time as a kid, I was hearing great words having great meaning.<eos> What brings us to Montreal?<eos> To Paris?<eos> To London? What takes us into dungeons, to parapets... - To Japan next.<eos> - To Japan, maybe, is a quest.<eos> It has always been a dream of mine to communicate how I feel about Shakespeare to other people.<eos> So I asked my friend Frederic Kimball, who is an actor and a writer and also our colleagues Michael Hadge and James Bulleit, to join me.<eos> And by taking this one play, Richard III analyzing it, approaching it from different angles putting on costumes, playing out scenes we could communicate both our passión for it our understanding that we've come to and in doing that communicate a Shakespeare that is about how we feel and how we think today.
Yes, one place else if you'll hear me name it.<eos> Some dungeon.<eos> Your bed-chamber.<eos> I'll have her.<eos> Gentle Lady Anne to leave this keen encounter of our wits and to fall something into a slower method was not the causer of the timeless deaths of these two men Henry and Edward, as blameful as the executioner?<eos> Thou was the cause, and the accursed effect.<eos> Thy beauty was the cause of that effect.<eos> Thy beauty. That did haunt me in my sleep to undertake the death of all the world that I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.<eos> Teach not thy lip such scorn.<eos> It was made for kissing, lady not for such contempt.
I'll have her. But I will not keep her long!<eos> - We'll never finish this movie.<eos> - It's got to be what it is. How much more will we shoot?<eos> It's a movie about a play.<eos> We're making a documentary about making Shakespeare accessible to people. Those people, the people in the street.<eos> They're not gonna get Richard III. I can't even get it, it's too complicated.<eos> Then why is it Shakespeare's most popular play?<eos> - Wait, what did you say? - Who says it's popular?<eos> It is!<eos> It's performed more than Hamlet. So what?
Did you hold much conversation?<eos> But I understand a cup was broken.<eos> That's right, sir.<eos> How did that happen?<eos> - I dropped it, sir. - You dropped it?<eos> - On the carpet?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> It landed on the fender, sir.<eos> I see.<eos> By rights it should be stopped from your wages.
I'm leaving now.<eos> It's tough training schoolgirls. I'm sure.<eos> You only have to look after your butterflies.<eos> You're lucky. All you have to do is stay here. Um...<eos> Not...<eos> Fucking smell.<eos> Do you jack off here?<eos> Did you call, Mr. Onda?<eos> See that car?<eos> It's been there for a few days. Check it out.
I'm not stalling though.<eos> I'm waiting.<eos> - For what?<eos> - Reinforcements.<eos> Well, you pick good people.<eos> You bet.<eos> See...<eos> George, George.<eos> There's a tumor in your brain that's spread out like a hand.<eos> Threads of it, you know, everywhere.
No, Nate, it's too chancy.<eos> - You can make it.<eos> Is that tight enough?<eos> Why don't you do it once more?<eos> There you go.<eos> Good. Now you've fixed it.<eos> What?<eos> You came here to die, didn't you?<eos> But I like this place, and I love the people here.<eos> You know, if we were to put this apple down and leave it, it would be spoiled and gone within a few days.
They are broken.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - The battle's over.<eos> God, forgive my people.<eos> - Don't you want to watch?<eos> - No, Your Highness.<eos> Like watching the ocean tide come in it is inevitable, but dull.<eos> Magnificent, general.<eos> This is your victory.<eos> A tide is a tide, Your Highness even when it's measured in blood.
And get into a semicircle hype or a rectangle, now!<eos> Hut! Hey!<eos> Very good. As you were.<eos> He means go back to what you were doing.<eos> Colonel Hall, you look fantastic, sir.<eos> Have you lost weight?<eos> Why, a couple of pounds maybe.<eos> Uh, Nell and I have been "sweating to the oldies". - Ah.<eos> - Uh, sergeant, I'm here to see about my car.<eos> Ah, well, I'm afraid we're still workin' on it, sir.
Francis, your brother's right.<eos> Your breath's disgusting.<eos> What did I tell you, my man?<eos> I'm concerned, Mick.<eos> Maybe it's time for you to get focused on something. Maybe get a job.<eos> Dad, I got a job.<eos> That's no job, it's an excuse to avoid reality.<eos> Think about settling down, sink your teeth into something. Something to give your life meaning.<eos> Not to work on Wall Street with this one, but how about the fire department or a cop?<eos> Something with benefits. Here's how I see it. Ever since the "hairy ass" incident you've been out of the game, you've been running away from life instead of running towards it.
You know what I thought?<eos> I thought... that if I saw him, I'd arrest him or shoot him.<eos> - What happened at the museum?<eos> - There was a long line.<eos> Lots of confusion.<eos> Inside... a strange atmosphere. It was really weird.<eos> The paintings... They... they seemed to be floating.<eos> I followed a group of tourists into a room and...<eos> I entered the painting.<eos> It was as if I was suddenly immersed in it.
Oh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a distempered appetite.<eos> there is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do nothing but rail... nor no railing in a known discreet man, though he do nothing but reprove.<eos> Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you.<eos> - From the Count Orsino, is it?<eos> - I know not, madam.<eos> - Who of my people hold him in delay?<eos> - he speaks nothing but madman.<eos> - Go you, Malvolio.<eos> if it be a suit from the count, I am sick, or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it.<eos> Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old and people dislike it.
Look you, sir, such a one I was this present: is't not well done?<eos> Excellently done, if God did all.<eos> 'Tis in grain, sir;<eos> 'twill endure wind and weather.<eos> 'Tis beauty truly blent,<eos> Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,<eos> If you will lead these graces to the grave And leave the world no copy.<eos> O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted.<eos> I will giveout divers schedules of my beauty:<eos> it shall be inventoried, and every particle and utensil labelled to my will:
ourselves we do not owe;<eos> What is decreed must be, and be this so.<eos> Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?<eos> Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither.<eos> he returns this ring to you, sir: you might have saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself.<eos> She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord into a desperate assurance she will none of him:<eos> -Well, receive it so !<eos> - She took the ring of me:<eos> I'll none of it.<eos> Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her will is, it should be so returned:
He's butt-naked.<eos> Not naked.<eos> I was not naked!<eos> He's without apparel.<eos> Half-naked.<eos> Naked.<eos> So, Jo's yelling at him to get out of the way, right?<eos> So he just strolls up to the twister and says, "Have a drink!"<eos> And he chucks the bottle into the twister and it never hits the ground.<eos> Twister caught it, sucked it right up.
Look at the truck. It's trashed.<eos> Of course, tornado activity continues.<eos> Reports from Fairview indicate a drive-in was blown away.<eos> We know there's injuries and the damage is massive.<eos> Is that what it was like up on the hill?<eos> That?<eos> No. We were lucky.<eos> Those were just downdrafts and microbursts.<eos> The tornado just sideswiped us.<eos> Which way is it headed?
So what?<eos> Genetically, he's worthless.<eos> We are here to train these boys.<eos> We create men here.<eos> This is a crucible of men. That's all it is.<eos> For you, too, my boy. The world is wide open. Come on.<eos> One day, he won't let us stand.<eos> One day, he'll betray us.<eos> Because his deceitfulness is endemic.<eos> It's inscribed in his genes.
I'm sure we're lost.<eos> We've been through this way before. We're fine.<eos> The token is leading us straight.<eos> - Clever little thing.<eos> - Yeah, very clever.<eos> - Shit!<eos> - The token!<eos> - It's hopeless.<eos> - Keep looking!<eos> It's gone!
Write a song"<eos> Because of the mood of the time, it seemed a great idea to do that song<eos> Everybody else was showing people knitting in Canada and Irish clog dancers in Venezuela. We'll just sing All You Need is Love<eos> It's a kind of subtle bit of PR for God, basically<eos> I don't know if the song was written before that<eos> We were making an album at the time so lots of songs were in circulation<eos> Paul may know more about that.<eos> Over to you, Paul<eos> I'm not sure... it was John's song, mainly<eos> I don't think it was written specially for it but it was one of the songs we had.

to make Americans think that America's new central bank operates in the public interest.<eos> The truth is that the Federal Reserve is a private bank, owned by private stockholders, and run purely for their private profit.<eos> "That's exactly correct, the Fed is a privately-owned, for-profit corporation which has no reserves,<eos> at least no reserve to back up the Federal Reserve notes which is our common currency.<eos> Well, absolutely.<eos> The Fed is neither federal and has doubtful reserves.<eos> It' a private bank that is owned by member banks and it was chartered under the guise of deceit by an act of congress in 1913.<eos> If there's still any doubt whether the Federal Reserve is a part of the U.S. government, check your local telephone book.<eos> In most cities, it's not listed in the blue "government pages."<eos> It is listed in the "business" white pages, right next to Federal Express, another private company.
Although the family controls scores of industrial, commercial, mining and tourist corporations, only a handful bear the Rothschild name.<eos> By the end of the 19th century, one expert estimated that the Rothschild family controlled half the wealth of the world.<eos> Whatever the extent of their vast wealth, it is reasonable to assume that their percentage of the world's wealth has increased since then.<eos> But since the turn of the century, the Rothschilds have cultivated the notion that their power has somehow waned, even as their wealth increases.<eos> Meanwhile, back in Washington in 1816, just one year after Waterloo and Rothschilds' alleged takeover of the Bank of England, the American Congress passed a bill permitting yet another privately-owned central bank.<eos> This bank was called the Second Bank of the United States.<eos> The new Bank's charter was a copy of the previous Bank's.<eos> The U.S. government would own 20% of the shares of the bank.<eos> Of course, the Federal share was paid by the Treasury up front, into the Bank's coffers.<eos> Then, through the magic of fractional reserve lending, it was transformed into loans to private investors who then bought the remaining 80% of the shares.
Might be wrong, but it's right.<eos> That's my motto, anyway.<eos> - Oh, well, that's clear, then.<eos> - Only applies to dolphins, not old women.<eos> I won't have any qualms about shoving a cork in your breathe-hole<eos> - when the time comes.<eos> - Ooh!<eos> - You'd better go, Gran. - All right, dear.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> Oh, dear. I'd forget my head if it wasn't screwed on.
Pride, you said.<eos> Presumption.<eos> And now the Shadows are on the move.<eos> The Centauri and the younger worlds are at war.<eos> The Narns have fallen.<eos> Even the humans are fighting one another.<eos> The pride was yours.<eos> The presumption was yours.<eos> For a thousand years, we have been awaiting the fulfillment of prophecy.<eos> And when it finally happens, you scorn it. You reject it... because you no longer believe it yourselves.
- I can hardly breathe.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> Jeanie.<eos> - About today...<eos> - Mark Greene looked in my file.<eos> Anspaugh has set a time for Mark and I to discuss hospital policy.<eos> - It'll remain confidential.<eos> - I don't put much faith in that.<eos> Maybe it's not going to be so bad. You're dealing with doctors.<eos> There's some understanding about the disease and how it's transmitted.
Hi, I'm Reilly Brown....<eos> - Mark, can I talk to you?<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> No big deal.<eos> - Reilly, that's all. You can go now.<eos> BP is 120/80.<eos> Mr. Wolfe here seems to have put his hand into a snow blower.<eos> Yeah, something was blocking it.
You in Ray?<eos> No go ahead.<eos> You guys go.<eos> AII right come on peppy.<eos> Listen Andy can I borrow that mistletoe?<eos> I wanna break the ice with the woman in Homicide.<eos> You okay Ray?<eos> What if they're right what if he didn't sign this?<eos> Come on Ray I don't even remember you ever looking at that ball.<eos> It's been buried in the closet since we moved here.
Oh, God, Liam, I'd love to.<eos> And there's the dinner afterwards.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> You have the honour of taking the winner out for a meal.<eos> And who pays for it?<eos> It's not me, did I hear that somewhere?<eos> Yes, that's right.<eos> We brought that in a few years ago.<eos> You get to take her out for a meal,<eos> - she gets to pay for it.
Some mean guys at the coffeehouse took my hat.<eos> -No! -You're kidding?<eos> It was ridiculous. These guys were bullies.<eos> Actual bullies.<eos> We're grownups.<eos> This kind of stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.<eos> Oh, no, wait a minute.<eos> I have no one.<eos> Let's go down there and get your hat back.<eos> Forget it. It's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.
Lieutenant Commander Rabb was flying.<eos> So you are the one who eluded me, Commander.<eos> Well, I had the advantage of ignorance.<eos> I wouldn't want to try it twice.<eos> Please don't.<eos> I can assure you next time, sir, it will be fatal.<eos> Fuente.<eos> At your service, señor.<eos> Assistant Secretary of State Bair.<eos> We had clearance to land, Capitán Fuente, and I don't understand why it was denied.
The victim gagged. The choke reflex made it difficult to swallow.<eos> So you think something else might have been put in the mouth?<eos> Something that wasn't ingested.<eos> Something that was overlooked.<eos> Nothing here but drinking and driving. We've pretty much gone through it.<eos> When they pulled the body out of the lake, which bank did they remove it from?<eos> I believe the other side.<eos> - Yeah, what is it?<eos> A woman's engagement ring soldered to a wedding band.<eos> It's engraved.
This ain't a pharmacy.<eos> Yeah, I happen to know you can get a doctor to prescribe right now.<eos> No one's prescribing here.<eos> Best you're gonna do is an aspirin till we get a full statement.<eos> All right. You listen to me.<eos> You listen to me.<eos> You listen to me good.<eos> I got methadone prescribed to me legally in my name.<eos> And I refuse to speak to you unless that's brought to me from my mother's place.<eos> It's hidden on the first ledge, where you were at.
But Rodney has serious mental problems, and I didn't wanna let him in.<eos> You're afraid of him?<eos> I just stopped feeling comfortable around him.<eos> His behavior could be so strange. The things he said.<eos> - I hated turning him away.<eos> - It stinks in here.<eos> What'd he do when you didn't let him in?<eos> He asked could he leave his car. Would I watch it for him?<eos> He said a friend ofhis gave it to him.<eos> Is it stolen?
- What's an overt act?<eos> - Does Ronnie know what Luis looks like?<eos> Not really.<eos> I think he saw him once at a christening.<eos> Do you have a picture of Luis?<eos> Wait here while I talk to my boss.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - I think they're gonna run in a ringer for Luis.<eos> If it's James Martinez, he's really cute.<eos> I'll tell ya, Hackensack or no Hackensack, Andy... you park that piece of junk on the street, the department of sanitation's gonna tow it.
- That's all I got.<eos> No, you've got to have bills, paper money.<eos> - You can't pay with this.<eos> - That's all I got.<eos> - Then you got no calzones. - Wait a minute!<eos> What happened to you? Where are the calzones?<eos> He wouldn't give them to me because I wanted to pay in change.<eos> - What the hell happened to your shirt?<eos> - He overcooked it.<eos> It's all ruined.
Come on, take a look.<eos> A tale of one city.<eos> Let's watch something else.<eos> Homer, you're trying to talk us into moving to this place.<eos> Oh, yeah, that's right.<eos> Let's watch this.<eos> Look at this place.<eos> Somebody ought to build a town that works.<eos> Somebody did.<eos> It's called Cypress Creek.
You could've gotten yourself killed!<eos> This may come as a surprise to you, Mr. Mallory, but I am not yet comfortable with making my private hygiene a public event.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Save me further embarrassment by locating my right shoe.<eos> Come on. You got it?<eos> Uh-oh, we got company.<eos> (Rembrandt) I don't know where this door goes, but...<eos> Try it!<eos> Let's go!<eos> (Rembrandt) Hey, it's locked!
There's no way he could have survived on his own out here.<eos> There's got to be other people, maybe a town?<eos> Da, maybe.<eos> Water.<eos> Wait.<eos> I'm dying of thirst.<eos> Drink that and you'll be dying, all right.<eos> Great.<eos> We finally find water and it's poisoned.<eos> I don't know if it's poisoned, Rembrandt.
Oh, I can't believe I got to go again.<eos> The cabin is right here.<eos> Don't worry, milady.<eos> What needs to be done will be done.<eos> (Wade) Hoping for a safe?<eos> Hoping for something.<eos> I've run out of places where you can hide things in this room.<eos> Since I'm still not sure exactly what you're looking for, it doesn't sound like much of a roadblock.<eos> The pin is not enough to prove that Lady Mary is trying to kill the Duke.<eos> She'll just say she lost it, or it was stolen, or something.
Glad to hear it.<eos> He's going to need all the help he can get if he's going to survive this.<eos> The Captain is not going to die.<eos> He is the Emissary. The Prophets will take care of him.<eos> With all due respect, Major I'd rather see Julian take care of him.<eos> Chief, I know you're worried but the Prophets are leading the Emissary on this path for a reason.<eos> Do not attempt to convince them, Major. They cannot understand.<eos> Since when did you believe in the Prophets?<eos> What I believe in... is faith.<eos> Without it, there can be no victory.
No one wants to suffer needlessly-- not like that woman you brought me.<eos> You killed her?<eos> I did what she asked.<eos> I thought this was a hospital and that you were a healer.<eos> I am.<eos> I take away pain.<eos> Now you've disrupted Tamar's death. I'll going to have to ask you to leave.<eos> I found the distress beacon in an abandoned building not far from here.<eos> It has its own power source.<eos> My guess is it's been repeating the same message for over 200 years.
And even if they find wreckage that seems to be from the shuttle, tell them to check for a recent warp trail.<eos> Stand by to engage atmospheric thrusters.<eos> Prepare for landing.<eos> Activate the viewscreen.<eos> Extend landing struts.<eos> Ready environmental controls!<eos> Disengage engines.<eos> Secure thruster exhaust.<eos> A fitting end for a people who would not share their technology.<eos> Let's see if you manage to survive... without it.
No! I have a duty to this crew. I can't just leave and go looking for the child.<eos> And I'd never consider letting you go into a Kazon-Nistrim stronghold by yourself.<eos> Captain, if I can get a shuttle through the crossfire, I can go back and bring the TaIaxians to help us.<eos> We're being boarded through the shuttle bays, Captain.<eos> Stay where you are!<eos> Don't move!<eos> hold your fire.<eos> Computer, activate medical holographic recall. Set for 12 hours. Mark.<eos> A fitting end for a people who would not share their technology.<eos> Let's see if you manage to survive... without it.
Not for my safety, for theirs.<eos> I was the greatest threat the Continuum had ever known.<eos> They feared me so much, they had to lock me away for eternity, and when they did that, they were saying that the individual's rights will be protected only so long as they don't conflict with the state.<eos> Nothing is so dangerous to a society.<eos> My life's work is complete, but they force immortality on me, and when they do that, they cheapen and denigrate my life and all life in the Continuum, all life.<eos> Captain, you're an explorer.<eos> What if you had nothing left to explore?<eos> Would you want to live forever under those circumstances?<eos> You want me to prove to you that I suffer in terms that you can equate with pain or disease.<eos> Look at us. When life has become futile, meaningless, unendurable, it must be allowed to end.
Simple physics, Captain.<eos> Not as simple as when I played on the high school tennis team.<eos> What can I do for you, Tuvok?<eos> I've completed my monthly security evaluation. All systems and crew are...<eos> Red Alert.<eos> Captain Janeway to the Bridge.<eos> Report.<eos> Some sort of spatial rift. It opened right in front of us. Analysis.<eos> It's a distortion in the space-time continuum, but it's got a graviton matrix.<eos> It's being artificially generated.
We can't be here when it's night.<eos> That's when the morrok comes.<eos> Is that a species of animal?<eos> The morrok is what takes you when you die.<eos> It lives here... in the cave.<eos> I'm not detecting any life-forms other than ourselves.<eos> It's here.<eos> It'll come.<eos> Have any of you ever seen this creature?<eos> You can only see it when it comes for you.
Who is she?<eos> It's gonna come out.<eos> Look, if you don't start trusting someone, you don't stand a chance.<eos> A few months ago I started... seeing her again.<eos> Again?<eos> I told you once what... what happened to me in Vietnam.<eos> - That I was caught in an ambush.<eos> - Yeah, you were the sole survivor.<eos> You also described what sounded like a near-death experience.<eos> There was nothing near about it, Agent Mulder.
You can't blame yourself for what you could only hope.<eos> He took me to a place with green fields... and I saw my sister.<eos> She was just a little girl.<eos> I've seen too many things not to believe.<eos> I've seen things, too.<eos> But there are answers to be found now.<eos> We have hope that there's a place to start.<eos> That's what I believe.<eos> You put such faith in your science, Scully, but... the things I've seen, science provides no place to start.<eos> Nothing happens in contradiction to nature, only in contradiction to what we know of it.
You've gotta get us out of here!<eos> Our silence had been shattered by the gunshot.<eos> The only command that could save us from the destroyer was the one to return home.<eos> An order I knew the captain would never issue.<eos> Johansen!<eos> Open this door!<eos> Open this door!<eos> Johansen!<eos> I knew mutiny was our only chance for survival.<eos> But I also knew, by sealing that door,... ..I was sealing the fate of the men locked behind it.
I don't...<eos> Either way, Krycek, you're a liar.<eos> Go on, finish it, Mulder! Come on, finish it!<eos> Do it!<eos> I want that digital tape.<eos> - I don't have it.<eos> - Like hell you don't!<eos> It contains secrets you were selling and all our government knows on extraterrestrials.<eos> How could I sell anything?<eos> It was encrypted.
- I thought you'd already left.<eos> - I... really need to keep working right now.<eos> - I'd feel better if you weren't alone here.<eos> - The guard knows I'm here.<eos> Was that Dr Bilac on the phone?<eos> Yes.<eos> We have a responsibility, Mona.<eos> To history and posterity.<eos> Dr Roosevelt did as any good conservationist would have done in bringing the urn back.<eos> Otherwise it would certainly have been destroyed.
It's, it's a good choice.<eos> Mulder?<eos> Let's get a team out here.<eos> - Let somebody else do this.<eos> - Help me, Scully.<eos> Mulder?<eos> It's not her, Scully.<eos> Am I right?<eos> Samantha broke her left collarbone when she was six. We had a rope swing in the backyard.<eos> - It's not broken, is it? - You're right.
Don't, don't...<eos> Xena.<eos> I'm sorry I hurt you.<eos> -It doesn't matter anymore.<eos> -It matters to me.<eos> I was a fool not to appreciate what I had.<eos> My wedding bracelet.<eos> I'm sorry I ever doubted you.<eos> I can see how this would destroy the ambrosis.<eos> It won't be destroyed... Just returned to the gods.
Please, Almighty God.<eos> You alone know how I have struggled to follow You always.<eos> I have given You my life to use however You will.<eos> And it is Yours even now, to take or leave, as You choose.<eos> But my son...<eos> Please...<eos> Don't take Icus.<eos> How dare you deny me anything?<eos> Either sacrifice Icus before the next sun or I will turn my face upon you and your people forever.<eos> Prove your faith to me, Anteus. Prove it to me above all things.
WE DID IT, BRAIN.<eos> PLANET EARTH BELONGS TO US.<eos> NOW, TO SEND STEPMOTHER EARTH INTO ORBIT.<eos> VERY WELL,<eos> BUT DON'T EXPECT ME TO BE NEIGHBORLY.<eos> BEHOLD, PINKY, OUR NEW DOMAIN WHERE WE SHALL BE THE MASTERS OF OUR OWN DESTINY.<eos> FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, OUR LIVES SHALL BE FILLED WITH VIM, VIGOR, AND VERISIMILITUDE,<eos> LORDING OVER EVERY LIVING CREATURE WITH FISTS OF FURY.<eos> WE SHALL NO LONGER CALL THIS PLANET EARTH, PINKY.<eos> WHEN WAS IT CALLED "EARTH PINKY"?
She needs to get laid.<eos> Knock, knock.<eos> What is it?<eos> I can't find my cross.<eos> The one Chris gave you?<eos> I have no idea where it is.<eos> Did you have it on when you left?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't think I did.<eos> It's got to be here somewhere.
I...<eos> I came to tell you that the house is finished.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> I want you to come out and see it.<eos> We can leave first thing in the morning.<eos> I can't.<eos> Why not?<eos> I don't understand you, Dora.<eos> Why won't you come and look at it?<eos> Because I'd probably love it and that would make it even harder.
- No way.<eos> I don't give in either.<eos> Except earlier this evening... he made me eat your puff.<eos> What a bastard!<eos> He loves to tempt me.<eos> Let's switch.<eos> Mine's such a square!<eos> Can't we oust them?<eos> Your conscience is with you forever.<eos> You have to learn to live with it.
We're gonna need a contingency if we lose comm with Houston.<eos> Let's get an idea where we stand on the consumables.<eos> Jack, get into the Odyssey... and bag up all the water you can before it freezes in there.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> Aquarius, we got some PC + 2 burn data for you fellas.<eos> So you're telling me you can only give our guys 45 hours?<eos> That brings them to about there.<eos> Gentlemen, that's not acceptable.<eos> - Power is everything. - What do you mean?<eos> Without it, they don't talk to us, correct their trajectory... they don't turn the heat shield around.
What do you mean?<eos> Well, you know, for instance... you have ideas that you ordinarily wouldn't have.<eos> - What kind of ideas?<eos> - Want to hear one?<eos> I have this idea, okay, for a television show. Some friends of mine are cable-access producers.<eos> Do you know what that is?<eos> Anybody can produce a show real cheap, and they have to put it on.<eos> I have this idea for a show that lasts 24 hours a day for a year straight.<eos> What you do is you get... 365 people from cities all over the world... to do these 24-hour documents of real time.<eos> Capturing life as it's lived.
With all the crime these days, you can't be too careful.<eos> Yes, sir. - You were lucky you were able to get to it.<eos> - I know that.<eos> Lieutenant Schiffer? The ME just rolled in.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You sure were lucky. No question about that.<eos> When you opened that door, he could've popped you there, considering the situation, how mad he must've been.<eos> - The situation?<eos> - Oh, the race.<eos> It was supposed to be fixed.
I'm tellin' you he killed 'em. He fucked 'em. He cooked 'em up.<eos> He ain't got a goddamn conscience.<eos> You understand what I'm sayin'?<eos> He'd just as soon slit our goddamn throats in the middle of the night as walk.<eos> Course, someone your age, Jesus, if you was to put one in him...<eos> "Johnny 'The Kid' Pickett Slays Cole Wilson."<eos> William Blake, do you know how to use this weapon?<eos> - Not really.<eos> - That weapon will replace your tongue.<eos> You will learn to speak through it, and your poetry will now be written with blood.
I just called the Oro Verde Bar in Saragosa.<eos> There was no answer.<eos> Let me know if you hear anything.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> I want a close lookout on all operations.<eos> That means double and triple checking, even our regular customers.<eos> I'll handle it.<eos> Where is my car?<eos> Is it finished?
Yeah, I got it. Yes.<eos> We're dealing with a megalomaniacal personality with paranoid schizophrenic...<eos> Let's skip down to the part where you tell me what the fuck this has to do with me.<eos> I don't know.<eos> What I do know is it does have specifically to do with you.<eos> This guy wants to pound on you until you crumble. - He wants you to dance to his tune, then...<eos> - Put on a dress and fuck me?<eos> I was going to say "kill you".<eos> He's sitting on an awful lot of rage.<eos> And it could be manifested physically if he's stressed.
- I'm serious.<eos> All right.<eos> Goddamn.<eos> - Goddamn.<eos> Stop your shit.<eos> Stop the mother...<eos> Dizam.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Watch my car, make sure nobody mess with it.
Anyway, this was a horrible, cold, rainy night.<eos> It was about 3am, nothing was working properly.<eos> The lighting took forever.<eos> But now we're out of that scene.<eos> This was a house in Malibu.<eos> That's Hackman.<eos> That's Rene Russo.<eos> And we were in a house in Malibu for about two weeks.<eos> This scene is very much like it was in the Elmore Leonard novel.<eos> It's pretty much shot in one shot.
Lin Tsi-hsui used this to burn the opium!<eos> This watch is great too!<eos> What's its historical background?<eos> Have you ever heard of Emperor Ping of the Soong Dynasty?<eos> Sure...<eos> This was the favorable watch of Emperor Ping.<eos> When he died, he wanted this to be buried with him.<eos> Let me show you.<eos> Don't pull too hard.<eos> It's opened like this!
what is it?<eos> What is higher learning?<eos> Promise me you won't drop out.<eos> I ain't going nowhere without you.<eos> Viking Two to Viking One.<eos> man.<eos> I'm gonna kill communication. This looks suspicious. All right?<eos> For Eurocentric indoctrination is learning in an environment that is mostly white.<eos> that if the Dred Scott decision was retried in a contemporary American court the decision would remain the same... would still have no rights... would be bound to respect.<eos> The result would be the same no matter what the law of the land states because it was not written by and for the benefit of African-Americans.
18 dishes make up the feast of the dragon door.<eos> The first challenge is to prepare the main dish of the feast, a bear paw.<eos> I'm making a "Bear Paw on the Snow".<eos> So I'll use a paw from a polar bear.<eos> That's not savoury!<eos> It sat in a a marinade for 3 days.<eos> Then I sautéed it with onion and white wine.<eos> Then, it was deboned.<eos> A plank!<eos> I hope he drops it on the ground!
10 out of 10, obviously.<eos> Some more?<eos> The monkey with shark is a magical dish.<eos> But this brain...<eos> Whatever you're gonna say, I'm the only contestant!<eos> There's only 5 minutes left.<eos> Qing Han can't come up with anything.<eos> Wrong!<eos> Monkey brain must be fresh.<eos> It should be eaten within 3 minutes of harvesting.
I have been looking all over hell for you.<eos> - You got the coin?<eos> - Yes, I got the coin.<eos> I didn't find any money. - Gimme!<eos> - Forget it!<eos> We're splitting it 50-50.<eos> We made a deal, that coin belongs to me. Yeah.<eos> Well, I didn't get the money, so now we're splitting it.<eos> We are not gonna sell it, you putz!<eos> It's got powers. What are you talking about?
We're splitting it 50-50.<eos> We made a deal, that coin belongs to me. Yeah.<eos> Well, I didn't get the money, so now we're splitting it.<eos> We are not gonna sell it, you putz!<eos> It's got powers. What are you talking about?<eos> What kind of powers?<eos> Put it on the table, you're not gonna believe this.<eos> It's amazing. Go on.<eos> Go on.<eos> - I can't, it's magically disappeared. - "It's magic..."
Yeah, well, sweetheart, that's gonna be a real fuckin' problem... because I don't have available people to go...<eos> She was waiting outside Nick's place when I went to get his notebook.<eos> She said she was looking for him, so I figured I should bring her here.<eos> You look really pretty in that dress.<eos> - How did you get here?<eos> - I took a bus here.<eos> - Went right to your apartment.<eos> - How did you get out of your room?<eos> Oh, I just went right through the door.<eos> - It was unlocked?
Well, sir, I've been thinking... Maybe it should be shut down.<eos> Yeah... how long you worked here, George?<eos> 15 years. 15 years. Well, you're...<eos> You're practically part of our little family, then, aren't you, hmm?<eos> I assume you'll be helping us run this town, hmm?<eos> I've known that machine since I was a little boy.<eos> My daddy bought it.<eos> Best business decision he ever made, I'll tell you.<eos> My god, Mr. Gartley, sir. That... that machine killed your daughter.<eos> Look what it's done to you.
Don't meddle any further.<eos> Accept the truth.<eos> I see disaster.<eos> I see catastrophe.<eos> Worse!<eos> I see lawyers.<eos> But wait!<eos> A messenger.<eos> I come from the midtown area, where Lenny Weinrib tortured by passions too overwhelming to regulate, did indeed call this little hustler on the phone in earnest attempt to see her again.<eos> At first, he wrestled with these drives, trying to master a curiosity not slaked by this initial meeting, but only whetted by it.
You found the Baron in a coffee-shop...<eos> Yes, in Germany...<eos> I was a student. He looked so melancholic...<eos> I asked the owner to sell him to me. But he wouldn't.<eos> The Baron had a lover, and he wouldn't separate them.<eos> He was waiting for her to come back from being repaired at the doll-maker's shop.<eos> Just like in my story!<eos> Yes...quite the coincidence!<eos> I had to come home, so I'd just about given up.<eos> Then a lady friend of mine said when the other doll came back she would take it and bring the two dolls together.
Shall we make some waffles?<eos> How dumb!<eos> I'm going to the movies with Torbjörn and after that we'll go to drink something.<eos> - Your mother is beautiful. - What do you mean!<eos> Yes, she's pretty.<eos> You don't imagine how irritating she can be.<eos> - Sometimes you don't like me at all. - Sorry. I don't know what happened to me.<eos> It has nothing to do with you.<eos> I used to have the same car.<eos> It got lost during a removal.
Is your heart beating faster?<eos> Is your pulse racing?<eos> - Good shooting, Kid.<eos> - Good shooting?<eos> If the Swede had been any slower, birds would've nested in his hat.<eos> Come on, Kid.<eos> Spotted Horse cannot be killed by a bullet.<eos> Four bullets in my arm, three in my left leg and two in the back.<eos> Another bullet went through my lip.<eos> Today a bullet went into my head and it's not even come out yet!
Show me then that walk.<eos> Well, sort of...<eos> I cannot.<eos> My imitation is too poor.<eos> The shoes are all wrong and, uh...<eos> But you, too, are a man.<eos> Have you not your own leaving step? No.<eos> It is others who leave me.<eos> Lunacy is a devilish liquid thing.<eos> It can only be coaxed out by blood, vomit or feces.
No. You don't know him.<eos> He'll wait for us to betray each other with the slightest glance or the merest gesture. Please.<eos> You must go!<eos> This God's punishment, because we tried to run from His Will.<eos> I will not say farewell, Hester.<eos> Pray God watch over you.<eos> And so will I.<eos> Kiss Pearl for me each night.<eos> 'Tis easy to see the mother's part in her.<eos> Is it beyond research, I wonder, to analyze her nature, and from it's make and mold, give a shrewd guess as to the father?
- Can't you take him with you?<eos> - We can't afford him.<eos> Perhaps he could make himself useful in the kitchen...<eos> Miss Dashwood...<eos> Elinor...<eos> I must speak to you.<eos> There is something of great importance that I need to tell you...<eos> about my education.<eos> - Your education? - Yes.<eos> It was conducted, oddly enough, in Plymouth.
Wait!<eos> Now!<eos> - Transporter room 2, do you have him?<eos> - They've got me.<eos> I can access the system to send us back to Federation space, but it will take several hours to activate.<eos> - Unless you help us.<eos> - Oh, I wish I could but I have very little time left, so I have initiated a self-destruct program.<eos> Then we'll have no way to get home.<eos> The Ocampa's enemies cannot be allowed to control this installation.<eos> In minutes, it will be destroyed.
Your stockings are falling down!<eos> There's no medical reason.<eos> Ever since her husband lost the movie theatre and he run off with that lady film - what do you call it? - Distributor. Oh!<eos> Now, over there is Jimmy Joe, who runs the Rooster and Pony.<eos> He is the nicest coloured man you'd ever want to meet.<eos> Robert Mitchum?<eos> Excuse me, you forgot something! Hello!<eos> Excuse me!<eos> You forgot your picture!<eos> I picked it up because I didn't want it to get dragged...
And Lewis!<eos> I can't get him out of my head.<eos> You'll get your chance to solo.<eos> You'll make it.<eos> We'll make it.<eos> That's bullshit, Hannibal!<eos> And you know it!<eos> We're not all gonna make it.<eos> When we first got here this barracks was filled.<eos> Look at it now.
Well, maybe it was the wrong number.<eos> That's why they chose me. I remember things.<eos> James, where did you grow up?<eos> Dr. Railly.<eos> I have the strangest feeling I've metyou before.<eos> This is 1 990.<eos> I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1 996!<eos> It's not the right numberyet! That's the problem!<eos> Won'twork.<eos> Can't open it. You thinkyou can remove the grill, butyou can't. It's welded.
Why?<eos> You're my ghoul now.<eos> I need you to help me find a woman.<eos> A woman? You came to the right spot.<eos> Brooklyn's full of hos.<eos> I'm not interested in your hos.<eos> I'm looking for a special woman, one of my kind, the only one like her in the world.<eos> As I've come to her, she'll soon come to me like a moth to a flame.<eos> So you're checking for a vampster bitch?<eos> Half vampire and she's ignorant of it.
You must be so hungry.<eos> Are you gonna get that?<eos> Uh, no, I'm, I'm gonna let the machine get it.<eos> It's for you.<eos> Um, that was the hospital.<eos> They say it's customary... for friends and family to come down and give blood.<eos> Let's go together.<eos> You know what? I think maybe we should take your truck. Oh, no.<eos> We oughta take Peter's car.<eos> - You know where it's parked, don't you?
It's nice here.<eos> My father buys places like this for people from Viena.<eos> Wittgenstein - if it tells you anything.<eos> Would you sell it?<eos> Noooo.<eos> Do you feel sick?<eos> That's good.<eos> I think that nowadays education diminishes human ability to suffer.<eos> Today a school is good only if children spend a nice time there.<eos> Ability to suffer is not seen as valuable. It is supposed to be useless.
Interpreting what he wanted is very difficult but an editor is always faced with the problems of filling a director's wishes as best you can.<eos> If he was here, of course, he'd tell you what to do, but an editor has got to try and divine what<eos> was in his mind.<eos> With financial support from the New Zealand Film Commission, the painstaking restoration proceeded smoothly.<eos> A gala premier was planned for New Zealand's most extraordinary feature film.<eos> However, 3 days before this event, the Colin McKenzie saga was to deliver one final twist.<eos> Six months ago, we wrote to every Spanish film archive requesting footage from the Spanish Civil War that was credited to a cameraman named Colin McKenzie.<eos> In the last six months, nothing has turned up. Not one foot of film. Until this morning.<eos> This roll of film here was confiscated by the fascists at the Battle of Malaga in 1937.<eos> It's been sitting in an obscure Spanish archive all this time, almost 60 years, and it's credited to a cameraman named C. McKenzie.
Does this look like a bullshitting face?<eos> Oh, she's home.<eos> Laurie?<eos> All right, all right.<eos> Where were you?<eos> Get your feet off my bed.<eos> Your mother said you were here.<eos> I was here.<eos> I got this idea.<eos> I think you're gonna love it.
You can be at no loss to understand the reason for my journey, Miss Bennet.<eos> You are mistaken, madam. I'm quite unable to account for the honour of seeing you here.<eos> Miss Bennet, you ought to know I am not to be trifled with.<eos> But however insincere you choose to be, you shall not find me so.<eos> A report of an alarming nature reached me two days ago.<eos> I was told, not only that your sister was to be most advantageously married, but that you, Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would be soon afterwards united to my nephew Mr Darcy!<eos> Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, to make my sentiments known to you.<eos> If you believed it to be impossible, I wonder what your ladyship would propose by coming here?<eos> At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted!<eos> Your coming to Longbourn will be taken as a confirmation of it, if such a report exists.
We were just working off the normal columns, which were...<eos> So it can't have sounded too good<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> We'd like to do a slow song now<eos> It's also off 'Beatles VI' or something.<eos> I don't know what it's off<eos> I haven't got it<eos> It's a waltz, this one. Remember that<eos> Anyway, the song's called, hopefully enough... aah, look at her!<eos> It's called Baby's in B! Ack
And by the time anybody got out to the island... the disease had wiped out the population.<eos> There was no one left alive to spread it to the new arrivals... and we assumed that the disease dead-ended at that point.<eos> Lazarenn, you are a doctor.<eos> You know as well as I do that diseases... they can go dormant for years or centuries.<eos> They can mutate, they can come back out of nowhere.<eos> Now, why weren't preparations made?<eos> Over time, it became more than just a disease. It became- I don't know, a legend.<eos> A specter used to frighten children into behaving.<eos> "Be good, or the dark angel will bring you the curse of Drafa."<eos> Only the immoral would ever be touched by it.
I don't think I can stay any longer.<eos> Will you give my love to...?<eos> Lazarenn!<eos> Lazarenn!<eos> Cross-analysis between Markab yellow cells... and Pak'ma'ra green cells complete.<eos> Match found.<eos> Show me.<eos> The brain gives orders to the body through a chain of electrochemical relays.<eos> An electrical impulse runs the length of a neuron and stops at a synaptic gap.<eos> It's translated into biochemical form which jumps across the gap... to the next neuron over and over until the information reaches its destination.
It's beautiful.<eos> I've never seen anything like it.<eos> There's no sign of instrumentation. No visible way in or out.<eos> It's absolutely seamless.<eos> Amazing.<eos> What kind of propulsion system does it have?<eos> No idea.<eos> In the two years since Ambassador Kosh arrived in this thing we've run a few surface scans, as much as we could get away with.<eos> We could barely even get through the skin.<eos> It's just been sitting here this whole time?
- What?<eos> I did a medical profile on you just before you left.<eos> Been through a lot since then:<eos> Oxygen deprivation, stress, fatigue.<eos> But according to the scanners, you're in better health than when you left.<eos> Hell, according to this file, this is the best shape you've been in for five years.<eos> I think you're exaggerating just a little, doctor.<eos> Yeah? According to your record, you have a chronic iron deficiency.<eos> It's a congenital condition.<eos> It's gone.
-What about our vows?<eos> -This weekend?<eos> We're going over them with the priest on Saturday.<eos> Well, what do you want me to do?<eos> Nothing. Forget it. Let's just bag the vows.<eos> -Tag, come on....<eos> -Forget it, it's not worth it.<eos> -Do you have a problem with authority?<eos> -Not generally.<eos> When it's enforced arbitrarily and undermines my authority, I resent it.
- Hey, Al.<eos> - Megan.<eos> OK, OK!<eos> I'm getting an air purifier!<eos> I've got one on order.<eos> Oh, I hate cigars!<eos> They stink!<eos> - It's a manly scent.<eos> - So is locker-room sweat.<eos> - Doesn't mean I wanna work around it.
Sir, Naval hospital called.<eos> That Recon team leader, Staff Sergeant Paxton, he just died.<eos> - Thank you, Sergeant Major.<eos> - Aye, sir.<eos> What's gonna happen?<eos> I'm gonna recommend you be charged with manslaughter, Lieutenant.<eos> I wanna retract my statement, Lieutenant.<eos> That won't change my recommendation.<eos> It will once you hear the tape.<eos> It wasn't erased.
This is the Ballard Institute.<eos> The last time I checked, it was in San Diego.<eos> And it still is.<eos> Only now it's a command post, and San Diego's an island.<eos> Map, please.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No, this map is wrong.<eos> Time, please.<eos> There's nothing wrong with this map.<eos> It's updated every hour on the hour.
- Hi, Jughead.<eos> Hello, Archie, Veronica, Mr. Weatherbee.<eos> - Is this Don Mattingly's signature?<eos> And Buck Showalter's?<eos> It's an interoffice envelope. It gets passed around all over the office.<eos> Hey, can I show this to my buddy Stubs?<eos> He runs a sports-memorabilia store. He'll pay top-dollar for pro autographs.<eos> Yeah, like I'm gonna risk my job with the New York Yankees to make a few extra bucks.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> No, you see, Don Mattingly signed this envelope. Then he sent it to room 318 where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter.
Agreed.<eos> Janeway to sickbay.<eos> Activate Emergency Medical Holographic System.<eos> Unable to comply.<eos> The EMH program has been disabled.<eos> Disabled?<eos> By whom?<eos> Unknown.<eos> The Doctor's initialisation routine has been locked out.<eos> It's encrypted.
- I can do it.<eos> It might be slower, but the wormhole can carry a transmission.<eos> - Where would the message end up?<eos> - I'll extrapolate the exit vector.<eos> I can't get it. There's a strange phase variance in the radiation stream.<eos> - We'll have to wait till the probe exits.<eos> - That shouldn't take long.<eos> Captain, I'm getting a distorted energy reading.<eos> The probe's telemetry has changed.<eos> It's stuck. It's mired in a gravitational eddy.
- I understand.<eos> I'll do my best.<eos> And I really appreciate your help.<eos> So far, our sensors have detected four separate scans of the microprobe, each on a progressively narrower band.<eos> Someone is interested in that probe.<eos> There may be a entity within the wormhole, curious about an intruder.<eos> Our probe would have detected that.<eos> - What's the condition of the probe?<eos> - I've been monitoring it.<eos> It's embedded in a gravitational eddy, but within 72 hours it will be crushed.
According to the encryption key, this particular code was not scheduled for implementation until Stardate 48423.<eos> That's a month after we left Deep Space 9.<eos> They must be looking for us.<eos> Your optimism may be premature, Mr. Kim.<eos> Sorry, Captain.<eos> But it's also infectious.<eos> Mr. Paris, lay in a course for the beacon.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> We're approaching the beacon's coordinates, Captain.<eos> It's drifted inside an ionized hydrogen cloud. The cloud's interfering with our sensor readings.
No. It may be closer to the rupture, but it's facing the wrong direction.<eos> The starboard ship is facing away from us.<eos> That means they're trying to give us easy access to the shuttlebay.<eos> There has to be some way to tell them apart besides which direction they're facing.<eos> The starboard ship's thrusters are at standby. They're holding position<eos> But the port ship is moving toward the rupture.<eos> Then I was right. It's the port ship.<eos> They're heading out.<eos> Don't you see? Voyager did move toward the rupture 20 minutes ago when we first discovered it.<eos> That's why the port ship is moving toward it now.
It's not working.<eos> You can't compensate for that size.<eos> Unstable plasma manifold.<eos> We're heading for a breach.<eos> Bridge to Torres.<eos> What's happening? We're reading a warp core breach.<eos> We're on it, Captain.<eos> Shut down the matrix!<eos> - It's not responding!<eos> - It's fused!
Well, uh, you see, this, uh, starship... it's not really a starship.<eos> It was a program that you wrote to study the psychological impact of long-term isolation on a crew made up of Starfleet and Maquis crew members.<eos> A program I wrote?<eos> That's preposterous.<eos> I'm the program. Voyager is a real ship, manned by real people.<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> This must have something to do with the radiation surge.<eos> What was that?<eos> Well, we've been having problems shutting the program down because of a kinoplasmic radiation surge on the station.<eos> It's affected all of the computer systems... including the holodecks.
Second of all, I wouldn't do it even if I could.<eos> And third, how do I know you're not an alien intruder trying to trick me into killing everyone?<eos> Well... those are good questions.<eos> First, I can tell you how to destroy the Voyager.<eos> Second, if you don't do it, you're going to die.<eos> And third...<eos> well, I'm just not an alien and I don't know how else to convince you of that.<eos> If what you're saying is true, why don't you destroy the ship? Why do I have to do it?<eos> You're the one running the simulation.<eos> It's coded to respond to your input, not mine.
I hope that you have better luck with yours than I had with mine.<eos> B'Elanna's the only one I know who tried to kill her animal guide.<eos> I'm sorry to interrupt, but the Doctor and I have come up with a rather surprising analysis of the matter left on the hull.<eos> It's organic.<eos> Microscopic life-forms from the nebula.<eos> That's not what I mean. The samples are clearly organic elements of a much larger life-form.<eos> It appears, Captain, that this nebula is not a nebula at all.<eos> I'm curious, Captain. Exactly what are you looking for?<eos> I need to know if we did serious harm to this life-form.<eos> Let's see-- you ran your ship through it, fired phasers at it, and blew a hole in it with a photon torpedo.
I want you to find out, Mulder.<eos> I need you to.<eos> You said you knew I was coming.<eos> In the desert things find a way to survive.<eos> Secrets are like this too.<eos> They push their way up through the sands of deception... so men can know them.<eos> This is my house.<eos> But why me?<eos> You are prepared to accept the truth, aren't you?<eos> To sacrifice yourself to it?
He does not feel like he's in control of his life.<eos> Very important.<eos> That's why he kills. Yes.<eos> - Can you see what he looks like?<eos> - He looks like a white man with facial hair... or not.<eos> But he has, yes, a tattoo somewhere on his body.<eos> Maybe the tattoo has the facial hair, I think.<eos> I see him here, forcing himself, yes, on the girl.<eos> But he cannot perform, so he's taking out his rage.<eos> It's gone. I lost the vision.
And in the meantime?<eos> Through hybridisation they've been erasing that aspect which has forced them to scatter:<eos> ...their identical natures.<eos> All the clones worked in abortion clinics.<eos> Access to foetal tissue.<eos> Though the biologies are incompatible they finally found a way to combine human DNA with alien DNA.<eos> And this man...<eos> Why has he been sent to kill them?<eos> The experiments weren't sanctioned.<eos> It was considered a dilution of their species, a pollution of their race.
Sorry for the holdup.<eos> We had trouble transporting Ganesha's body this morning.<eos> - This is Agent Scully.<eos> - Hi. Have they determined what he died of?<eos> She.<eos> Ganesha was a 12-year-old Indian female.<eos> Near as I can figure, she ran herself into exhaustion.<eos> How did she escape?<eos> Well, now, there's a puzzle.<eos> When I got the call this morning, I expected to find her cage open or something, but it was locked tight, just like I left it.
Somebody else might get hurt.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Kazuo Sakurai, the diplomat you detained.<eos> Our murder suspect.<eos> He didn't make his flight last night.<eos> This morning his body was found floating face down in the CO Canal.<eos> I think we can assume he wasn't diving for pearls.<eos> The Japanese government believes that he was murdered for the contents of a briefcase.<eos> - A piece of evidence that wasn't logged in.<eos> - What do they think was in it?
If they're trying to kill you, that's the first place they'll look.<eos> Those bastards!<eos> I'll call someone who can help.<eos> The only thing you can do for her right now is to try to crucify them.<eos> This is a serious mistake.<eos> An innocent woman's been snot.<eos> - Can this be traced?<eos> - This is your man.<eos> There was a mistake.<eos> It will be rectified.
his little sister was injured in the incident the other day.<eos> there you have it.<eos> I'm not piloting it by choice either.<eos> An emergency call.<eos> I'll go on ahead.<eos> A special state of emergency has been declared for the Kanto and Chubu regions surrounding the Tokai district.<eos> All residents must evacuate to their designated shelters immediately.<eos> Repeating...<eos> The target has been sighted by our cameras.<eos> It's already penetrated into our territorial waters.
I'll see you later maybe.<eos> - Bye, Gran.<eos> Bye, dear.<eos> - Morning, Patsy.<eos> - Are you feeling all right, dear?<eos> - Well, actually...<eos> Oh, good.<eos> - Pats, what do you think about the kitchen?<eos> - It's fabulous.<eos> - It's not done yet.
What are you saying?<eos> I do not understand you.<eos> Ah good. ..<eos> She wants to see her room.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> She would like to see her room.<eos> Ah good... of course.<eos> But, it is not finished yet.<eos> Here you go, little Miss.<eos> So, do you like it?
Get out! Get out!<eos> Warning: Assholes are closer than they appear!<eos> Give me a push while you're back there.<eos> Alrighty, then!<eos> It's alive!<eos> My little baby, come here.<eos> You missed Mommy, didn't you?<eos> Did Daddy hurt you? I won't let him. No, I won't.<eos> How can I ever repay you?<eos> There is some damage to my car, and I had to fill it with premium.
- Stop!<eos> - Hey, man, what are you doing?<eos> Hey, bro, we got signed.<eos> - Are you crapping me?<eos> - Didn't you play the song for him?<eos> No.<eos> We didn't hook this thing up yet.<eos> - So you two haven't heard the demo?<eos> - I heard it on the radio earlier.<eos> You heard it for about five seconds and then it got ate.
You!<eos> You're the lucky one...<eos> Now I am.<eos> Now I am.<eos> I worked for it, with my pins and my shoeshine.<eos> This way! I'm a poor blind man!<eos> So now it's like this.<eos> What about the box then?<eos> It's all right.<eos> Yes and without it...
Yes and without it...<eos> Well...<eos> What about your daughter? She leave you a little?<eos> Because a man... Well a man needs...<eos> I'd say...<eos> My daughter's the one who needs...<eos> Poor thing... at it all day with the guesthouse washing.<eos> She's the one who needs...<eos> Well listen... tell me how you got that box of yours.<eos> It was her man who got it.
I go jogging too get rid of the e excessive water in my body.<eos> This makes me feel very happy.<eos> When I leave the ball court. I decide too leave my pager behind... .. because I know very well that no-one is going too call me today.<eos> Messages for A/C 3688.<eos> Password. please.<eos> "Love you a million years. " Your friend in Room 7002 says Happy Birthday.<eos> On May 1. 1994. a woman said Happy Birthday too me.<eos> Because of this. I'll remember her all my life.<eos> If memory can be canned. I hope it will never e expire.<eos> If an e expiry's date must be added onto it. I hope it will be "a million years".
Don't you?<eos> I'm very easy-going. I don't mind staying at one place.<eos> Let's go together.<eos> I've almost saved enough money.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Why are you always like that?<eos> The letter. is still with me.<eos> I haven't got the time to pick it up.<eos> Give me your address and I'll mail it to you.<eos> Then it won't be lost.
- Whatever.<eos> - He can't sleep.<eos> I'll miss my bus. I'll be late again.<eos> I'll get docked for sure.<eos> There's some macaroni and cheese in the cabinet, okay?<eos> Got your lunch?<eos> Keys?<eos> Exact change for the bus?<eos> Oh, shoot, baby, thank you.<eos> Forget my head if it wasn't screwed on.
Very nice.<eos> Artie, another round.<eos> On him. Ramona, you're still on the clock.<eos> We have rules here.<eos> You can't sit next to your hair. Sit under your hair.<eos> Gotta put your wig on.<eos> My follicles need to breathe, and my shift is over.<eos> It's crooked.<eos> Your wig's crooked.<eos> It's tilted too much.
We're gettin' ready to get in the car, and... Roll on, roll on...<eos> - Here we go.<eos> - Jinx! You owe me a Coke!<eos> Roll on, little Citroen, Roll on, roll on down the road _<eos> - This is 7 Arlington Place, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I have to shut off your electricity.<eos> - What?<eos> - You gotta pay your bill.<eos> - It's paid.
You're trespassing, and you owe me a fucking new door!<eos> I'm looking for something in an engagement ring.<eos> Gold.<eos> You're looking for a coroner, shit-for-brains.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Oh, shit on me!<eos> - Mr. Gideon.<eos> You're not paying attention.<eos> I repeat, a gold engagement ring, yes?<eos> It was pawned here a year ago by a customer of yours named Tin Tin.
Two cognac, Julien!<eos> And one for the boss! - A drink, doctor?<eos> - Never while on duty.<eos> - Just like the cops!<eos> - For me either, then!<eos> Is my car ready, Mr. Martineau?<eos> Dunno, I don't work weekends.<eos> Do I put the gear in the Mercedes?<eos> - When'd Dad promise it for?<eos> Then it must be fixed.
Teach me to be a kung fu master like you.<eos> I cannot.<eos> Hey, I can pay.<eos> Never mind.<eos> I had to turn him down.<eos> I know.<eos> Our mystical skills cannot be taught to outsiders.<eos> Hungry?<eos> Where's the pear?<eos> It got smashed.
Disguise myself?<eos> Sorry we don't have enough rooms<eos> Please would you stay in the cells<eos> Not a problem Thank you<eos> Which is mine?<eos> This one, we've given you the biggest one<eos> Not bad at all<eos> What's inside this box?<eos> It seems heavy<eos> I've no idea, it's been sitting here forever
- Fong, we must go.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Very smart, uncle.<eos> Watch out.<eos> - Did you do it?<eos> - Blame it on me.<eos> - I mean this.<eos> - My hand is not that small.<eos> Say it was you, otherwise it was her.<eos> Leave it, we have to go.
- You can't stay here.<eos> Out! - Why?<eos> Not Officer Krupke, the saintly cop?<eos> There's nothing going on.<eos> And he's not a saint, simply a decent human being.<eos> Something you couldn't...<eos> If you eat one more of those...<eos> - Are you having an affair?<eos> - No, we just hang out together.<eos> You should have heard that bitch downstairs talking about it.
Are you okay?<eos> -Up out of there.<eos> -Larry, what is this?<eos> -It's our patient.<eos> -What's the matter with him?<eos> My best guess, his baby's tangled in the large intestine.<eos> His baby?<eos> Oh, God!<eos> -Is the room prepped?<eos> -Yeah, it's prepped.
Merry christmas to you, Mr. Collins.<eos> Uh, my children... wanted me to remind you to stop by the house tonight.<eos> I won't forget.<eos> I promise. We live in stanford--31 Shellhammer bromton road, the big white house.<eos> Yes.<eos> I know it well.<eos> Well... anyway, merry christmas.<eos> Oh, uh, Mr. Collins,<eos> I hope you've taken down that old television antenna.<eos> I ripped my pants on it last year.
Good.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I wonder how my hat got up there.<eos> I'll go change.<eos> I'd like a pond... with turkeys, chickens, rabbits, chicks, gnus, pheasants.<eos> In another pond, a whale!<eos> How I'd love a whale!<eos> Look at this dress.<eos> Lovely.<eos> I agree, but look how it's made.
Give him my card.<eos> I want you to tell him that Leo Higgins reckons he's a great man... the best council president this town's ever had.<eos> - What happened to your nose? - What?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Sunburnt, that's all.<eos> - Chook.<eos> Shut the door!<eos> - That's her.<eos> Miss, we'd like to have a word to you about your dress.<eos> - What's wrong with it?
I know, I remember the Osmonds.<eos> - Better hit the rack, Magirk.<eos> - In a minute.<eos> First I'll make a list of the people I'm gonna kill in the next few days.<eos> Lights out!<eos> Lock down in two minutes!<eos> My dearest snookie wookums buns,<eos> I miss you so much.<eos> I haven't felt this bad since... the last time I was dumped.<eos> I remember it well.
- You know your weapons, Mr ...<eos> - Robbins.<eos> The new man.<eos> - How did you get it?<eos> - I slept with the owner.<eos> - Did you hear that?<eos> - He's determined to escape.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> You're on an island, Mr Robbins.<eos> It's called Absolom, situated 200 miles from the mainland.
Look at that. Sandusky double-parked in front of his office.<eos> You're missing it. Commissioner of the whole city, double-parked, no ticket.<eos> - This doesn't enrage you?<eos> - Sweetie, it's horse shit.<eos> I know it's horse shit.<eos> I tried to get the damn Brooklyn thing.<eos> Wilder won't answer his beeper.<eos> He's up there jerking off.<eos> You okay?<eos> You never really appreciate bladder control until it's gone.
I was a good friend of your dad`s.<eos> We were in that Hanoi pit of hell together for over five years.<eos> Hopefully you`II never have to experience this yourself,<eos> When two men are in a situation,., ,.Iike me and your dad were for as long as we were,., ..you take on certain responsibilities of the other.<eos> If it had been me who had not made it.,. .,Major Coolidge would be talking right now to my son Jim.<eos> But the way it turned out, l`m talking to you, Butch.<eos> I've got something for you,<eos> This watch was first purchased by your great-grandfather.,. .,during the First World War,. ,.in a Iittle general store in Knoxville, Tennessee.<eos> It was made by the first company ever to make wrist watches.<eos> It was bought by Private Eryne Coolidge.., ,.on the day he set sail for Paris.
None of those boys had any illusions about leaving that island alive.<eos> Three days before the Japanese took the island.., ,.he asked a gunner on an Airforce transporter named Winocki.,. .,a man he'd never met before, to deliver to his infant son,.<eos> .,who he`d never seen in the flesh, his gold watch.<eos> Three days Iateryour granddad was dead, but Winocki kept his word.<eos> After the war was over, he went to see your grandmother delivering.,.<eos> ,.to your infant father, his dad's gold watch, this watch,<eos> This watch was on your daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi,<eos> He was captured and put in a prison camp,<eos> If the gooks ever saw the watch, it would be confiscated,..<eos> ..taken away, The way your dad saw it, this watch was your birth right. He`d be damned if he'd let anyone put their greasy yellow hands on it.
- Why not F.A.G.?<eos> - Because we're no fags!<eos> It's obvious.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> Let me remind you we're a little late.<eos> That's for sure, I guess.<eos> Don't run!<eos> Is this your idea of fun?<eos> For Nietzsche, you have to win your liberty from the State.<eos> For Rousseau, it must be guaranteed and protected by the State.
Grand Central Station.<eos> Housatonic.<eos> Cornwall, Connecticut.<eos> I will... I will... I'll get right on the way.<eos> - Dick, I'm glad you could make it.<eos> That's some snappy-looking Mercedes.<eos> Come around the back. We're just about to eat.<eos> What's that, the 300?<eos> Yeah, it's my father's birthday, so I bought myself a car.<eos> - It's only got 110 miles on it.
Your gas card.<eos> I'll pay that bill for one year.<eos> And since Helen Anne's got herself a brand-new Infiniti, we're gonna give you her old BMW.<eos> You pick it up at our house.<eos> BMW?<eos> BMW! Yeah. Tom, didn't you listen to her speech today?<eos> She doesn't want a BMW.<eos> Mom, I'll handle this.<eos> I'm not gonna sit here and listen to some strange ethical argument about a damn car.<eos> It's got four wheels. It runs well.
Chema, do you need an invitation?<eos> What a beauty!<eos> She was sleeping in the sun.<eos> I was worried about her.<eos> She's as beautiful as you.<eos> Are you scared?<eos> Open Khedija's door.<eos> It seems to be locked.<eos> That's not like her.<eos> Come open your door. It's locked.
Can you play?<eos> A little.<eos> I'm learning.<eos> And you, what do you do?<eos> I'm a teacher.<eos> I teach Sarra and Selim.<eos> Come with them if you like.<eos> My mother would say no.<eos> Your voice is beautiful.<eos> Too bad it's locked up inside.
I sent the girl to be killed.<eos> Tell me how did you kill her?<eos> - She's alive.<eos> - Then she's a danger to you.<eos> She now knows exactly who you are.<eos> How long will you let her live?<eos> How long before your pure instincts take over?<eos> I'm onto your plan.<eos> You still don't have the beryllium sphere.<eos> Without it, you can't complete the bomb.
There's no time for this.<eos> Eliminate them.<eos> That is a Galaxy-class starship.<eos> We're no match for them.<eos> I think it's time we gave Mr. La Forge his sight back.<eos> Maybe they're not out there.<eos> They're just trying to decide if a 20-year-old Klingon bird-of-prey can be a match for the Federation flagship.<eos> -Perhaps they're on the surface.<eos> -Sir, according to my calculations, a solar probe launched from either the Klingon ship or the planet surface will take 11 seconds to reach the sun.<eos> However, since we do not have an exact point of origin, it will take us between 8 and 15 seconds to lock our weapons onto it.
Data's arranged to run tests on you in the biometrics lab.<eos> We're ready if you are.<eos> No.<eos> We have to get to the Neutral Zone.<eos> The Neutral Zone?<eos> Why?<eos> In the other two time periods, Starfleet reported a... A sort of a spatial anomaly in... In the Devron system.<eos> Captain...<eos> If the anomaly appeared there in the past, it might be here, too.<eos> Because you saw it in two other time frames, doesn't mean it'll be here.
Am I too hard?<eos> Perhaps I am.<eos> I'm like your Uncle Vanya - disappointed in life, become a detractor.<eos> Disappointed in life?<eos> Um, in life? No.<eos> In our life.<eos> Our provincial life.<eos> I hate it with the power of my soul.<eos> And my life - oh, yes.<eos> In my own personal life, I am pleased to swear to God... there's not one thing good in it.
It's about this entity, whatever you want to call it.<eos> It's old. It's very old.<eos> It's existed in different forms in different times.<eos> The only thing that stays the same is what it lives for.<eos> What is that?<eos> Well, the murder of innocence.<eos> This is still a script we're talking about, right, Wes?<eos> Yeah, well, I sort of think of it as a nightmare in progress.<eos> Well, in this nightmare in progress then, does this thing have any weaknesses?<eos> Well, it can be captured sometimes.
Captured?<eos> How?<eos> By storytellers, of all things.<eos> I mean, every so often they imagine a story good enough to sort of catch its essence... and then for a while it's held prisoner in the story.<eos> - Like the genie in the bottle. - Exactly.<eos> Exactly.<eos> But the problem comes when the story dies.<eos> That can happen in a lot of ways.<eos> It can get too familiar to people... or somebody waters it down to make it an easier sell.<eos> You know, or maybe it's just so upsetting to society that it's banned outright.
No.<eos> If you had, you wouldn't ask why we won't move to the road!<eos> It's no place to live.<eos> All that smoke and asphalt and people passing!<eos> Indeed.<eos> Thanks a lot, this is where we get off.<eos> Mrs. Shiva, let them off here.<eos> Grandmother, give me your address.<eos> We haven't got one!<eos> Give it to me anyway, we may need it later.
-Watch out!<eos> And boy, if I could only figure out--<eos> Don't grab my arm! Please, don't! Don't!<eos> I asked you not my arm.<eos> WOMAN: Look out, the dragon clone!<eos> Adlai, what's the matter? MAN:<eos> Burn up, dragon clone.<eos> I'm on fire!<eos> Ah, I'm on fire!<eos> Stay away from the fence! It's electrified! Ah!
I don't know... but he's... he's getting to me.<eos> Goddamn, you're a great broad, really.<eos> I know.<eos> This is going to be a good one.<eos> - Oh, Jesus.<eos> Not there, honey. - Wait.<eos> I'm sorry. Damn.<eos> What is that, your hair comb?<eos> I'm on my hair clasp.<eos> It's got teeth!
I´m not allowed to talk to the guinea pigs.<eos> I´ve come to sleep, not talk.<eos> Change in there.<eos> Bondo ...<eos> Dear brethren, I have never previously exercised my right to convene you.<eos> So you will understand the gravity of my problem.<eos> You know I set great store by my research, despite the friendly teasing about my lack of hepatomas.<eos> And that´s the point.<eos> After a ten year wait, a wonderful hepatoma has popped up.<eos> The tumor will allow me to conclude my research but I can´t have it!
I'll go now.<eos> We're going now.<eos> Move out of the room, Pats, slowly.<eos> Slowly, slowly, don't frighten Saffy.<eos> Go to the door, go to the door.<eos> Sofa, crisps.<eos> Undo your buttons.<eos> Open the door!<eos> - It's stuck!<eos> It's locked!
This is what I do well, sweetie.<eos> You might get some tips for the Debating Society.<eos> Without notes, Saff.<eos> Thank you, thank you.<eos> I, the proposed accused, think that...<eos> I mean, the day in question was not a good day for me, all right.<eos> But I don't see how any day could've been the way this bloody country is run.<eos> I was just trying to do my best. Trying to get from A to B, do a little shopping.<eos> I was trying to take control of my life.<eos> Only to find that actually it is controlled for me by petty bureaucracy and bits of bloody paper and ignorant bloody petty rules and laws that just obstruct every tiny action, until you find you've committed a crime without even knowing it.
I didn't know anyone was counting.<eos> Jeff you're my friend.<eos> You've been my friend longer than you've been my officer so I think I'm entitled to say this.<eos> We were both in Earthforce during the war.<eos> I wasn't on the line, but I did my share.<eos> I know a lot of guys who came out of the war changed.<eos> Some came out better, some came out worse.<eos> A lot of them have this problem.<eos> The war gave them definition, direction, purpose!<eos> Without it, they look for ways to go out in a blaze of glory.
The Babylon Project was a dream given form.<eos> Its goal: to prevent another war by creating a place... ... where humans and aliens could work out their differences.<eos> It's a port of call, home away from home... ... for diplomats, hustlers, entrepreneurs and wanderers.<eos> Humans and aliens, wrapped in 2,500,000 tons... ... of spinning metal, all alone in the night.<eos> It can be a dangerous place. But it's our last, best hope for peace.<eos> This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations.<eos> The year is 2258.<eos> The name of the place is Babylon 5.<eos> Commander Sinclair, as the representative of the Centauri Republic I demand to know what information your government has about Ragesh 3.<eos> We don't know any more. We only know it was attacked.
- No?<eos> Think about it.<eos> You want to assassinate someone, so you get a telekinetic.<eos> He reaches into a person's throat and gently, quietly, with a thought... he pinches the carotid artery shut.<eos> The blood stops, the brain starves the target dies and then you just let go.<eos> Murder without a trace.<eos> No fingerprints or poisons.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - But they didn't understand, Talia.<eos> - The power, how far it....
Take a load off.<eos> Man, talk about malpractice.<eos> Hey. Slow down.<eos> You take the sedan.<eos> I'll go after the other one.<eos> Clean your windshield, mister?<eos> Scratch one bat.<eos> The van was registered to Rupert Thorne.<eos> But Harvey was in the sedan.<eos> It was headed for Stone Gate.
Alcohol awareness is a hobby with you, isn't it?<eos> I can't go.<eos> What if they make me take a test?<eos> I can't do tests.<eos> I always clutch.<eos> What if I fail and all our dreams crash and burn?<eos> That's very simple.<eos> Meldrick and I will harm you.<eos> Look at this doll.<eos> It's got bright, happy eyes, the eternal smile of innocence.
All right, OK.<eos> So what are you saying?<eos> I'm saying that you, Tim Bayliss, you've got a darkness inside of you.<eos> You've got to know the darker, uglier sides of yourself.<eos> You've got to recognise them so they're not sneaking up on you.<eos> Love them, because they are part of you.<eos> Along with your virtues, they make you who you are.<eos> Virtue isn't virtue unless it slams up against vice.<eos> So consequently your virtue is not real virtue.<eos> Until it's been tested.
Please, stay behind the line.<eos> Anybody see anything?<eos> - Not that they're telling.<eos> - The bullet?<eos> - Haven't found it yet.<eos> - No one heard a gun go off?<eos> None of the uniforms?<eos> 15 guys and no one heard a gunshot?<eos> I relieved Hellriegel of his weapon.<eos> It had only been fired once.
We tracked down the payphone where the anonymous tip came from, over on Montford Avenue.<eos> No prints.<eos> It was wiped clean.<eos> Roger, I wanna know about the garden shed at the Goodrich scene,<eos> What about it?<eos> Yes or no, did you ignore potentially crucial information about the shed?<eos> - Has Pembleton been in...<eos> - Yes or no?<eos> I probably could've taken a closer look, yeah.<eos> Your sloppiness compromised this investigation before it got started.
The body is that of a well nourished black male...<eos> Congratulate me.<eos> What for?<eos> Felicia and I have decided we're in love.<eos> So, you've decided it's love, huh?<eos> What were the choices?<eos> Could have it been insanity?<eos> - Congratulate me.<eos> - I'm not gonna touch that hand.<eos> I don't know where it's been.
Come along, Agnes.<eos> He's not as intelligent as I thought he'd be.<eos> The name Garrideb will almost certainly mean nothing to you but I feel I should relay the particulars of a most extraordinary tale.<eos> How long had the diamond been exhibited before its theft?<eos> Nearly 10 years.<eos> Inside the same glass case?<eos> Yes, as far as we know.<eos> Has this lock ever been changed?<eos> The whole gate would have to be replaced, Mr. Holmes, nothing was left to chance.<eos> Inspector, whoever took the diamond was able to walk in here without any apparent difficulty since there were no marks or scratches on the lock to suggest it was forced, we may safely conclude the thief had a key.
The neighbor says Mr. Carlin called her from work at 1 0 a.m. Asked her to come over and put a note on the fridge that he was working late.<eos> -So that prick could establish his alibi.<eos> -He told the neighbor he kept calling... ... hiswifebuttherewasnoanswer .<eos> The neighbor had a key, went in... -... andfoundthebody.<eos> -You'd better get over to Chinatown. -Okay.<eos> Nice meeting you.<eos> LESNlAK: Same here.<eos> So I understand you took a domestic violence complaint on this victim.<eos> See, not all that damage is recent.<eos> Her jaw's half off because it's broken on both sides from about a month ago.
You got my drift?<eos> Now, let's talk about the bank.<eos> What's up with the G?<eos> You're gonna need more than $ 1 000 for bail, you lying sack of crap.<eos> Hold up, I've been straight with you.<eos> Look here, I'm just trying to help you guys look good.<eos> -Tell us where you got the gun.<eos> -Look, I told you. I found it at the scene, yo.<eos> I am telling you, yo, that you weren't there.<eos> Tell me where you got it.
That's exactly what I saw.<eos> What do we have to go over this for?<eos> We say what we saw.<eos> -That's right.<eos> -You didn't see the gun. Hell I didn't.<eos> It was a 4-inch revolver.<eos> You didn't see it.<eos> James, look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I know there was a gun and I know it was pointed at me.
I'm Jerry Seinfeld.<eos> I tell jokes for a living but there's no joking about the financial crisis at PBS.<eos> Show us you care.<eos> Call in your pledge now.<eos> Jerry, I am so grateful that you're doing this.<eos> Oh, I know you are.<eos> -You got the card I sent? -I did.<eos> -So where is it?<eos> The card.<eos> Is this it in the trash?
-Who are you, anyways?<eos> -I'm the father.<eos> -He said his father was dead.<eos> -He said I was dead?<eos> That's right.<eos> Squeezed an extra $25 out of me.<eos> That's what my life is worth to him, $25?<eos> I want you to know that I'm retracting our dinner invitation.<eos> You don't have to retract it. We never went.<eos> I'm retracting that it was ever offered.
Well, maybe she couldn't spare it.<eos> - A square?<eos> - Well, you know sometimes a square is everything.<eos> - A ply?<eos> - Elaine, you cannot judge a person in a situation like that.<eos> It's like asking for someone's canteen in the desert.<eos> - It's battle conditions.<eos> - Yeah, well I just hope I run into her again, okay?<eos> Because I will never forget that flinty voice.<eos> It is tattooed in my brain.
I'm a troll man<eos> I'm a troll man<eos> I don't want you playing with something that has such bizarre hair.<eos> Awful, awful hair.<eos> And now my daughter, Jessica who has just returned from boarding school will read the same passage I just read.<eos> I noticed a few of you weren't paying attention.<eos> Wow, there is a God.<eos> I'm telling you, the light would work better if it pointed out to sea!<eos> Shut up, I know what I'm doing.<eos> I hate the sea and everything in it.
- Oh, Marge.<eos> It's a miracle.<eos> How can you judge this man without talking to the people who know him best?<eos> We got the real dirt on Homer Simpson, and the bidding starts at 10 G's.<eos> - I bid 10 G's. - Ten-five G's.<eos> I need a hug.<eos> How come you guys hesitated?<eos> Sorry, Dad. We do believe in you. We really do.<eos> It's just hard not to listen to TV.<eos> It's spent so much more time raising us than you.
- Hello!<eos> - Hi!<eos> - We're here!<eos> - Oh, goody.<eos> The sea monkeys I ordered have arrived.<eos> Look at them cavort and caper.<eos> Sir, they're the new winter caretakers for the lodge.<eos> Yes, they work hard and they play hard.<eos> This house has quite a long and colorful history.<eos> It was built on an ancient Indian burial ground and was the setting of Satanic rituals, witch burnings and five John Denver Christmas specials.
The old Klingon ways are passing.<eos> When I was a young man, the mere mention of a Klingon empire made worlds tremble.<eos> Now our warriors are opening restaurants and serving "racht" to the grandchildren of men I slaughtered in battle.<eos> Things are not what they were, not even the blood oath.<eos> You don't believe that.<eos> What I believe is no longer relevant.<eos> You are released from Curzon's oath.<eos> You owe nothing to any of us.<eos> Are you still reading a plasma leak? I can't find it.<eos> It's been intermittent.
I had never seen anything like these creatures either.<eos> "Seen" isn't an appropriate description.<eos> He had no eyes.<eos> I was describing it in simple terms.<eos> He had never perceived anything like us before.<eos> Go on.<eos> I had to find some way to communicate, so I transformed myself into... lt was remarkable.<eos> I would come into the lab, and Odo would be there resting in his liquid form in a Krokan petri beaker.<eos> One morning Odo was gone.<eos> The beaker was empty, but next to it was an identical beaker that had not been there before, a perfect replica in every way.
- By way of a Xepolite free trader.<eos> - Why the Xepolites?<eos> Xepolites have often served as intermediaries for us.<eos> So have the Lissepians.<eos> But the Xepolites have never been caught.<eos> The Xepolite ship isn't responding to our hails.<eos> Would you respond if your cargo bays were full of Cardassian weapons?<eos> Let's see what they're carrying.<eos> Our scanners can't penetrate their hull.<eos> It's composed of a sensor-reflective material.
But, before we say good-bye, I need your help one last time.<eos> Certainly.<eos> Remember that power source I was telling you about?<eos> The one preventing you from trying to contact Commander Sisko.<eos> Well, I found it. And what did it turn out to be?<eos> I couldn't tell.<eos> There was a door blocking my path.<eos> I need you to help me open it.<eos> What kind of door?<eos> It was composed of some kind metal that the tricorder couldn't identify.
We cross the border in 30 seconds.<eos> What th?<eos> I'm sorry. I can't let this happen.<eos> Sir, the vessel being piloted by Lieutenant Ro is firing a low-intensity particle beam into the nebula.<eos> What the hell is she doing?<eos> The polarizing effect being created by the beam may make it possible for us to be detected.<eos> Can you counter the effect? I will attempt to do so.<eos> Ro, why are you firing?<eos> Scan the nebula.<eos> There's a Starfleet attack force hiding inside it.
So, you're Ronin.<eos> A pleasure to meet you.<eos> - Where are you from?<eos> - Earth. Scotland.<eos> How long have you been on Caldos?<eos> All that matters is that I'm here now, and that we plan to be together for the rest of our lives.<eos> - Data to Picard.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> We have located the source of the energy.<eos> It is concentrated within Felisa Howard's coffin.
Can I do that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Now, I think the stocking.<eos> Yes, baby, you have got the most beautiful legs I've ever seen, but I bet you hear that a lot, don't you?<eos> - VALERIE:<eos> Gary? - Yeah?<eos> You don't have to take my other stocking off because it's already off.<eos> - What're you...<eos> - In fact, all I have on is this white, silk, see-through dress.<eos> Can't you see the shape of my body through it?
- It's also the most implausible.<eos> - Is there another possibility?<eos> Somebody could've given him her address.<eos> I don't know who.<eos> There's our turn-off.<eos> - Have you seen this guy?<eos> - Yeah, he was here.<eos> He's wanted for kidnapping a federal agent.<eos> Did you let him go up on the tram?<eos> It's shut down in the summer.
I'll call you the minute I hear anything.<eos> OK, yeah.<eos> OK.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Tony!<eos> Tony!<eos> I checked the wind-up profiles.<eos> They're up to speed.<eos> Which means?<eos> Whatever this image is, it was recorded in that room with the girl.
Brandenburg Concerto Number 3.<eos> Two.<eos> Good thing it wasn't a DoubleJeopardy question.<eos> Do you know the significance of this piece?<eos> Well, recalling Music Appreciation with Professor Ganz,<eos> Bach had a genius for polyphonic...<eos> This is the first selection of music on the Voyager spacecraft.<eos> The first.<eos> Four and a half billion years from now, when the sun exhausts its fuel... and swells to engulf the Earth, this expression will still be out there, traveling four and a half billion years.<eos> That is if it's not intercepted first.
It's been almost 18 hours.<eos> Where could the body be?<eos> There are cables and debris all over the bottom.<eos> This is a painstaking business.<eos> Can I ask what the fbi's interest in this case would be?<eos> The suspect matches the description of a federal fugitive...<eos> Really? How's that?<eos> No description of the suspect's been released.<eos> If you don't mind, can we take a look at the car, please?<eos> It's been taken to the impound.
Where?<eos> Here.<eos> That's near where we found the first body.<eos> Right, except this is an old overflow system that dumps into the harbor during heavy rainfall.<eos> That must be where it got into the system.<eos> It's working its way back out to sea.<eos> That's the overflow pipe.<eos> It leads to another vault like this one, then about three-quarters of a mile to the sea.<eos> Let's see if we can get that gate closed.<eos> It's rusted in position.
How does that happen?<eos> Radiation.<eos> Abnormal cell fusion.<eos> The suppression of natural genetic processes.<eos> Mulder, nature didn't make this thing.<eos> We did.<eos> I know these.<eos> These are from Chernobyl.<eos> That creature came off of a decommissioned Russian freighter that was used in the disposal of salvage material from the meltdown.<eos> It was born in a... in a primordial soup of radioactive sewage.
- Can we?<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Ask your mother.<eos> - Mom, guess what.<eos> - We're going to Itchy Scratchy Land.<eos> No.<eos> I've already planned our vacation.<eos> We're going to the Highway 9 bird sanctuary.<eos> I understand they've installed a new bird feeder this year.<eos> It's shaped like a diner.
It's brilliant!<eos> - Terry Mack.<eos> - Dale Lawrence.<eos> He's had 12 donors, all from the New York Blood Center.<eos> Are you saying the New York Blood Center won't give me a list of the donors?<eos> The CDC is convinced he couldn't have gotten the disease from any other source except the transfusions.<eos> The legal protection of donor confidentiality prevents me...<eos> A donors has a disease that will kill the man who got the blood from you to save his life.<eos> If we don't find that donor before he donates more blood and kills more people...<eos> Unless there is irrefutable scientific evidence that the alleged disease does exist, that it can be blood... borne and if so, has been proven to be transfusion transmissible there is nothing I can do.
No matter how hard you search you won't find any evidence to suggest the contrary.<eos> He was on the board of several corporations.<eos> He was the chairman of the Fundraising Committee for St. Patrick's.<eos> He was meticulous...<eos> He was meticulous in concealing his other life even from me.<eos> Please don't ask me to betray him now.<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> But we're trying to stop an epidemic.<eos> We know that this disease can be transmitted by gay sex.<eos> We hope to prove it's also transmitted by blood products.
Now entering Green Level.<eos> Please standby.<eos> Ambassador Delenn.<eos> I've seen you here before. Almost every other day.<eos> If you don't mind my asking, what-<eos> Notice the waves, each moving in its own order.<eos> Predictable.<eos> Unchanging.<eos> But drop in a single stone and see how the pattern changes.<eos> Everything around it is altered.
May I humbly suggest that we decline jurisdiction in this matter.<eos> This is more properly a matter for a true court of law.<eos> A court of law such as that on the Vorlon homeworld.<eos> After all, the crime committed was against their ambassador.<eos> I therefore move that Commander Sinclair be remanded for transport to the Vorlon homeworld, along with the witnesses and evidence that have been accumulated.<eos> There to stand trial on the charge of attempted murder.<eos> Ambassador!<eos> Unless the Earth Alliance is trying to cover up the facts.<eos> If that is the case, then Babylon 5 is a fraud!<eos> A motion stands before this Council. It must be voted upon.
- Tomorrow afternoon.<eos> Buy me breakfast tomorrow?<eos> Jesus!<eos> If you'd like to come this way.<eos> Let's go in here.<eos> Where did anybody put Teddy...<eos> Ross thinks we should all talk.<eos> Sure glad you guys don't make cigars.<eos> Smoke bothers you?<eos> Only if I'm in the same city with it.
Yes, I was very disappointed.<eos> I wanted him there very much.<eos> You wanted him there very much and he explained why he had to leave but you're not sure what he said?<eos> You can see, ma'am, we're...<eos> It's just not gonna look too good on the report.<eos> - You know what else doesn't look good?<eos> - What?<eos> Your tie.<eos> It doesn't look good.<eos> What's the matter with it?
- Yeah, Sheriff, it's Marty.<eos> Me and Norris just found old Homer Gamache, deader than a squashed coon.<eos> - Jesus!<eos> - Guy across the street saw Homer stop last night to pick up a hitchhiker about, uh, 1am.<eos> White male.<eos> We figure he popped him for his truck.<eos> We got a description out on it.<eos> He took his leg.<eos> He took his damn leg.<eos> No, he didn't take it.
[...] [...]<eos> I'm going home.<eos> [...] [...] [...]<eos> [They sing.]<eos> [...] [Ululating women] [...] [...]<eos> Oulé was great now.<eos> But the more he grew, at least I saw.<eos> Lena come.<eos> Tell me, what will do Oulé in the bush?<eos> It is still with it, huh?
It is you.<eos> You came back.<eos> I knew you'd come back.<eos> Oh, sweetheart. I'm right here.<eos> It's OK.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> I know you miss her.<eos> All right, you got a piece. Now.<eos> - It's got blue on it.
Great. We'll split a cab.<eos> Don't you need to change?<eos> Don't I look all right?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> The way you were looking at me, I thought there was something wrong.<eos> A little five o'clock shadow perhaps, but nothing that would turn the jury against me, do you think?<eos> I can't figure out who sent that damn thing.<eos> What?<eos> The letter, Jennifer.<eos> They say it was sent on the same day that Rita died.
What?<eos> The letter, Jennifer.<eos> They say it was sent on the same day that Rita died.<eos> But Rita never left the apartment that day.<eos> And the mail chute upstairs has been out of use since the renovations began.<eos> Well, you certainly wouldn't mail any letter to the state's attorney's office.<eos> 'Course not.<eos> Suppose the greedy nephew sent it. Or one of the cousins.<eos> They certainly know what her signature looks like.<eos> They've seen it on enough checks.
Many died.<eos> Le Loi, Jia Long and the Trung sisters.<eos> And your ancestor Phung Thi Chinh fought to throw out the Chinese.<eos> Your grandfather fought and died against the Japanese just before you were born.<eos> We suffered much.<eos> When the Japanese came your mother and I were taken to Danang to build a runway for the airplanes.<eos> We worked like slaves.<eos> Our reward was a bowl of rice and another day of life.<eos> Freedom is never a gift, Bay Ly.<eos> It must be won and won again.
A certain Winter uses his service.<eos> Winter?<eos> Tell me... do we happen to know the same Winter, by any chance?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I only know him casually.<eos> I shadowed him once.<eos> Well, then, doyou have any more pain?<eos> Not right now.<eos> Ready to dive into the next car?<eos> Provided, of course, it's got a sliding roof.
See you on Friday.<eos> A brick wants to be something, huh?<eos> I bet it doesn't want to be a lawyer.<eos> -What are you doing here?<eos> -I missed you, too.<eos> -How you doing?<eos> -I'm good.<eos> Getting it together.<eos> She wants a divorce.<eos> She wants her freedom, and if you don't contest it, you get everything.
Come on.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Took your father up a while ago.<eos> He's reading some letter.<eos> Was it from a company?<eos> He's expecting a letter from a watch company.<eos> There's big money in watches.<eos> Now how would I know who it was from?<eos> Was it typed or written by hand?
It doesn't concern me.<eos> It doesn't concern me either.<eos> Well, perhaps.<eos> I am slightly afraid of scandal.<eos> What are we doing that's scandalous?<eos> I'm entertaining you in my parlor.<eos> Where I come from that would hardly be construed as...<eos> You come from France.<eos> France is a country living in the modern era.<eos> Perhaps even ahead of it.
- It says more about you than him.<eos> - What about your rigidity?<eos> - How about that point? - Get into bed.<eos> Could you come upstairs today?<eos> I got a leak in the kitchen.<eos> Sure. - Well, but it will be this afternoon?<eos> - l'll be back in a minute.<eos> - A minute.<eos> - Ted, I'm in his apartment.<eos> The urn is missing. It's gone.
I weave my fragrant garland<eos> And with the scarlet ribbon from my wavy pIait<eos> I shall bind that fragrant garland<eos> I shall intertwine it with a double bloom<eos> My dark-haired lover will delight in it<eos> I shall drop my fragrant garland into the water<eos> And the silver wave will bear it away
Oh, my poor friend, the fault is mine, forgive!<eos> - Oh, how I am deceived by fate!<eos> - You were always my faithful friend<eos> - I have been yours since we were children<eos> - I never plagued you... ..with my entreaties!<eos> - Oh, the fault is mine, forgive me!<eos> And I, Iike you, am unhappy<eos> Do not reproach me, I am drawn for ever by an unknown destiny<eos> Oh, would I couId die of this passion<eos> But there is no strength in my poor heart to fight it
alas, fatal passion, you have poisoned life's every hour!<eos> I submit!<eos> Fate's dread will cannot be subdued by force<eos> - And I, Iike you, am unhappy - How bitter it is, how cruel<eos> Fate bids me to love eternally<eos> But my heart must suffer eternally too<eos> And I, Iike you, am unhappy, do not reproach me<eos> I am drawn for ever by an unknown destiny<eos> Oh, would I couId die of this passion<eos> But there is no strength in my poor heart to fight it
I do love nothing in the world so well as you.<eos> Is not that strange?<eos> As strange as the thing I know not.<eos> It were as possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as you.<eos> But believe me not.<eos> And yet I lie not.<eos> I confess nothing, nor I deny nothing.<eos> - I am sorry for my cousin.<eos> - By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.<eos> Do not swear, and eat it.

He took files and documents that Wakefield left for him not related to the case.<eos> When he got back to his own office, he found a memo on the bottom of the stack.<eos> He'd inadvertently taken it from Wakefield's desk.<eos> A copy of the memo is attached to the affidavit.<eos> He copied the memo and left the memo under the files on his desk.<eos> Next stop, Washington Herald!<eos> No! Stop! Get out of the car!<eos> EDITOR: There was a car explosion in a garage near the Riggs Bank.<eos> The police traced the car to a leasing agency.<eos> It was rented yesterday by Grantham.
What story?<eos> See what you can find.<eos> Smith Keen meet Darby Shaw.<eos> So, Mr. Grantham what the hell is going on?<eos> Sweetheart, I'm down here in the basement.<eos> It's about two in the morning.<eos> This is an affidavit concerning a memo I found on my desk.<eos> I'm going to trust you to do with it what you will.<eos> The memo's from Velmano, he's a senior partner.<eos> It was dated September 28th addressed to Wakefield and it read:
-Can you make some mustard sandwiches?<eos> Well, go to it.<eos> Here, you can spread it with that.<eos> Yeah, that one's mine.<eos> Be right back.<eos> Don't be stingy with that mustard, now.<eos> -Grab the kids.<eos> Quick!<eos> Forget the car, Bob.<eos> It's only got 1 000 miles on it!
- Andy.<eos> Yes, once.<eos> Approximately what year did that event take place?<eos> I guess it was 1984... 84 or 85.<eos> Were you aware in 1984 of the fatal disease called AIDS?<eos> And that you could contract it through sexual activity?<eos> I'd heard of something...<eos> The gay plague.<eos> The gay cancer.<eos> We didn't know how you could get it or that it killed you.
Biscuits!<eos> No, no sound.<eos> I knew she was mute but now I'm thinking perhaps it's more than that. I wonder if she's not brain-affected.<eos> Shush!<eos> - No sound at all?<eos> - No.<eos> It was a table.<eos> Well, she was very violent with the gown.<eos> She tore off a chunk of lace.<eos> I've had been here to see it. I'd have sworn you she'd have used her teeth and wiped her feet on it.
Uh, just looking at Bill's-- I mean, uh, Dad's baseball.<eos> You know he doesn't like you to touch his things.<eos> Yeah. I- - I know.<eos> Sorry, Mom.<eos> Has he ever told you about that ball?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Uh, not really.<eos> I- - I don't think so.<eos> No, no, no, he hasn't at all.<eos> I don't- - I don't know anything about it.
Uh, not really.<eos> I- - I don't think so.<eos> No, no, no, he hasn't at all.<eos> I don't- - I don't know anything about it.<eos> Babe Ruth signed that ball.<eos> He was... the greatest baseball player who ever lived.<eos> - Oh. Really?<eos> - He sure is.<eos> Your dad's father gave it to him.<eos> Maybe someday he'll give it to you.
- Dead? Legends never die, kid.<eos> But you're really him.<eos> You're The Babe.<eos> The Sultan of Swat.<eos> The King of Crash.<eos> Of Crash, and a hundred other dopey names.<eos> Forget about that stuff, kid.<eos> We ain't got much time.<eos> - I'm here 'cause you're in some kind of a pickle, right?<eos> A baseball with my John Hancock on it... went over a fence and you can't get it back, right?
M-F-E-O?<eos> Made for each other.<eos> It's cute.<eos> Like a little clue.<eos> So he can't write.<eos> Big deal.<eos> Verbal ability is overrated in guys. Our need for it leads to trouble.<eos> - I'm going to run back to Walter.<eos> - And the letter?<eos> It was written before I went out there.
Yes, you!<eos> What the hell was that all about?<eos> - Those things you were saying...<eos> - I was saying?<eos> I can't believe that was you! You don't really believe all that propaganda, do you?<eos> Peter, he's the one who's got his head full of propaganda.<eos> Did you hear him? He was actually defending the Jews.<eos> But... but Benny is Jewish.<eos> Yeah. And see what that music's done to Arvid?<eos> It's perverted his brain. Look at him.
He's right, Wyatt.<eos> You want us for anything, we're with you.<eos> Hold him.<eos> No, get her out of here!<eos> Somebody shut that dog up!<eos> I said hold him, goddamn it!<eos> Somebody get that goddamn dog out of here!<eos> The bullet's too deep.<eos> I can't get it out.<eos> The way it's lodged in the back... I'm sorry.
You speak like a rebel.<eos> In a way, I am.<eos> But a peaceful one.<eos> Peaceful like a dandy, an aristocrat, a "bon vivant."<eos> - Isn't that what you are?<eos> But I don't know where's the incompatibility with justice, and much less with the idea you have of what's fair.<eos> The problem is just a matter of ethics.<eos> 'Ethics' with capital 'e'.<eos> That's what's missing.<eos> Europe made it all up without it.
The stones!<eos> We have failed in our duty... the Armageddon.<eos> We saved two of the stones.<eos> The amulet...<eos> does she still wear it?<eos> - It is gone.
The wise old man saw that that was the way things were.<eos> But something in him was still homesick for the ice, where everything was radiant and absolute and relentless.<eos> Though he had come to like the idea of the rough ground, he couldn't bring himself to live there.<eos> So now he was marooned between earth and ice, at home in neither.<eos> And this was the cause of all his grief. ♪ MOZART:<eos> Hail Chromodynamics, Lord of Quantum.<eos> This is Quark, Charm and Strangeness reporting. Concerning the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein deceased.<eos> The solution to the riddle of life in space and time lies outside space and time.<eos> But as you know and I know, there are no riddles.<eos> If a question can be put at all, it can also be answered.
Did she study in the same college where you and Kiran studied?<eos> Yes.<eos> What's her name?<eos> What name should I tell you?<eos> They ask who Ghalib is!<eos> Somebody should tell me what I should answer.<eos> What's her name?<eos> If I take her name, she will be disgraced.<eos> Don't ask me the story of my heart.<eos> The pain of the heart doesn't get reduced if it is concealed in liquor or poetry. ln fact, it increases.
Viking movies? Ya.<eos> I guess.<eos> I love that stuff... just, helmets with the fucking horns on... Right<eos> That's what we should be wearing tomorrow, right?<eos> If you ever want to see it, I've got some videos... Viking stuff made in Norway, which is excellent.<eos> What about this music? Do you like dixieland?<eos> Yeah...<eos> I guess.<eos> I live for this music, man. This is real music.<eos> It's got a heart and a culture all of it's own.
They're assholes. Just having fun.<eos> So... how does it work?<eos> Fucked up my drill bit. It's okay.<eos> You can buy another one.<eos> Keep your fingers crossed.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Excellent, excellent.<eos> What next? We find the fuse box.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> I'll find it for you.
Come on!<eos> MACE: Get in the car!<eos> Jade Butterfield, get in the car this instant.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Where the hell have you been?<eos> We've got guests freaking out.<eos> -You stole my car. -(DOOR CLOSES)<eos> Sorry.<eos> We just wanted to make sure it wasn't parked in.
And no one will ever know.<eos> Once the ratings drop they'll sell your holographic image like an old video game.<eos> You'll be a relic, a Milton Berle.<eos> You're too late, little punk.<eos> We made sure she was in church real early today.<eos> She's praying right now.<eos> We're talking with presidential candidate Senator Tony Kreutzer.<eos> The man who dragged us, for better or for worse into the age of virtual telepresence.<eos> Let's talk about Synthiotics.<eos> Been talking about it for 30 years, Billie.
It's there that you have diversity, that you have species that could lead to new drugs, that we have all the heritage, the flora and fauna.<eos> You can have 400 species of trees per hectare.<eos> This is the kind of forest that must be protected.<eos> The indigenous people are a special case, basically, they've evolved together.<eos> They're here, it may even belong to them to some extent.<eos> They don't do damage anyway.<eos> It's like the Indians here.<eos> I imagine that the damage is quite limited, and... if occasionally they shoot a spider monkey, it's not this that's going to endanger the spiders monkeys.<eos> It's not they who destroy the forest anyway...<eos> These people have lived for a long time here, often in balance with it.
But complicated basketry like that one, there aren't many men who can do it.<eos> Among the young people, it's already in decline, because... because they're already moving towards white civilization.<eos> So they don't know where to place themselves, they don't know much what to be interested in.<eos> The last to still be interested in practicing basketry, they're aged about 18-19, but the boys of my age don't know how to do it.<eos> Those among them who have completed a school education, must now find a new way of life.<eos> If I had money, I'd prefer to go to another city, for example Cayenne, Paris...<eos> -Yes, to travel, to buy things.<eos> Couyamane specializes in producing symbolic and religious objects.<eos> Here he refurbishes the traditional headdress... worn during the initiation ceremony.<eos> It's constituted of feathers of many birds and especially the Macaw, the best-known of the multicoloured parrots.
- I might not like you.<eos> - You're breaking my heart, Rhino.<eos> I ain't scared of you, but you ain't gonna trick me into taking a swing at you.<eos> You got nothing on me.<eos> You seem to have me confused with the police, Rhino.<eos> I want information, and I'll get it any way I please.<eos> Who's your boss?<eos> You want information, watch the news.<eos> You've got a hard head.<eos> How about using it for something besides a blunt object?
- You're Talia's father?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But surely you would not expect her to mention me by name.<eos> Keep your distance!<eos> I am merely old.<eos> Older, perhaps, than you can imagine.<eos> But not so old that I cannot assist you in your search.<eos> I get the message.<eos> Okay, then. For openers, look at the blade.<eos> It's used by a cult of mercenaries based in Calcutta.
Oh, what's the matter? Getting a little tired, poor baby?<eos> Just play the game, Sanders.<eos> What the hell was that? What's the problem?<eos> If you can't stand the heat... Give me a break. You aimed the ball right at her.<eos> I don't wanna play anymore. Hey, come on, it's 4-4. Shake it off.<eos> He's an idiot.<eos> Damn it, Steve!<eos> What the hell's the matter with you?<eos> - I didn't mean to hit you. - But you did. - Will you quiet?<eos> - Get out of my face. - It's supposed to be fun. - I know it's a big thing...
- Isn't this funny?<eos> - That's not funny.<eos> - That is ridiculous.<eos> - Nothing's funny...<eos> - How you gonna ask...?<eos> - Ladies! It's Christmas.<eos> Let's not argue.<eos> My Santa suit.<eos> It's been stolen.<eos> It's stolen.
We can snap this case shut, Chief, but, like you said, Calpurnia is Lewis' case.<eos> We don't wanna step on any toes.<eos> Well, Lewis is working on the Thormann shooting.<eos> You guys take it.<eos> When it's time, if he's clear, we'll include him in.<eos> OK, take em' all downtown.<eos> Forensics found nothing.<eos> We're never gonna find Thormann's gun.<eos> Its been sold three times by now.<eos> It's probably being used in a heist in some cantina in the Yucatán right now.
Don't get married.<eos> Don't get engaged.<eos> Don't even date on a regular basis.<eos> Trust me.<eos> My wife got hold of one of those magazines, one with the questionnaires.<eos> "Keeping the Flame Lit - 125 Ways to Avoid Divorce."<eos> So every night before we go to bed, my wife asks me a question and we have a meaningful discussion.<eos> I've been up for a hundred... and... nineteen nights.<eos> They should just get that door fixed.<eos> It's not broken.

You've got to come and be charming to the Trotters.<eos> I took them to dinner, done my bit for Aunt and Country.<eos> But more is needed. I want Trotter to take Milady's Boudoir off my hands.<eos> You've loved it like a son.<eos> Bertie, if magazines had ears, Milady's Boudoir would be up to them in debt.<eos> I've got nasty little men in bowler hats at my door.<eos> I can't come to Brinkley. lf l'm seen near Florence Craye, I'll get my spine broken.<eos> You're so selfish.<eos> You don't know how important this is.<eos> You don't know how important my spine is. I'm attached to it.
She told me about you.<eos> - Why are you holding hands?<eos> is that some English custom?<eos> - l am D'Arcy Cheesewright.<eos> - Mr Cheesewright!<eos> Heavens to Betsy!<eos> I thought your face was familiar.<eos> You used to row for Oxford College.<eos> Somebody pointed you out to me at an eighth week ball one year.<eos> You had a moustache then. I do declare, you look much handsomer without it.
- l say!<eos> - She'd become a tyrant, Bertie.<eos> I had a vision of our life together, stretching away, me prancing about in tartan socks, with caffeine poisoning.<eos> - Not a pretty picture.<eos> - But she's followed me.<eos> I saw her earlier going into cabin 27 on the corner.<eos> - Roderick!<eos> - What? What?<eos> I'm sorry but I've had an idea.<eos> I won't go into it but I too am being pursued.
- Well, well, well.<eos> Come on, Bertie.<eos> We are going out to celebrate my engagement.<eos> Engagement?<eos> You mean the poor unwitting girl said yes?<eos> She did!<eos> I said, "l may be poor but honest now but we can soon change all that."<eos> In a couple of months' time, I'll have New York at my feet.<eos> Well, all the ones who like soup.<eos> - And she fell for it?
(Briscoe) Who's got Silver's house?<eos> I do, but there's nothing yet.<eos> No calls, no ransom notes.<eos> Silver's probably taking tranquilizers.<eos> They, uh, checked the register tapes.<eos> Somebody bought the stuffed gorilla maybe three minutes before they locked the doors.<eos> $400. Cash.<eos> $400?<eos> What was it stuffed with?<eos> Oh, wait, three minutes to take the escalator down from the 5th Floor with a little girl, a big stuffed animal and get out the front door before it's sealed?
So somebody programs the blood scanner to find patients with this profile and tells it to kick up their blood sugar reading?<eos> The blood sugar looks higher than it really is.<eos> They get more insulin than they really need.<eos> It's not like someone could just walk in here, tap a few keys and reprogram the blood analyzer.<eos> First, you'd have to create something like a computer virus and then somehow get it on the machine's software.<eos> Well, who has access to the blood analyzer?<eos> You're lookir at him.<eos> Well, ahem, back at the precinct, all of our computers talk to each other.<eos> Same story here?<eos> Yes, every time I run a test here, it automatically gets billed to the patient on the accounting computer.
He's lying to you.<eos> I'm not talking to you because I don't want to...<eos> -... butbecauseof whoyou are .<eos> -What's that mean?<eos> You're my lover. I don't want you involved.<eos> -What if that's unacceptable to me?<eos> -We'll try it.<eos> SERGEANT: What do you got, Janice?<eos> This car's been on my block for a week.<eos> Thought I'd see if it was stolen.
You know, I love the name "Isosceles."<eos> If I had a kid, I would name him Isosceles.<eos> Isosceles Kramer.<eos> Hey, you know what, maybe we should all chip in for the gift.<eos> - The chip-in.<eos> - Hey, pretty good idea? - Yeah.<eos> - The chip-in.<eos> Definitely.<eos> Let's go to that mall in Lynbrook before the party.<eos> - We'll take your car. It's got room.
Do you have a ketchup secret?<eos> Don't have a ketchup secret.<eos> Because if you do have a ketchup secret I would really, really like to know what it is.<eos> Field of vision, huh?<eos> How's everything? - Really good.<eos> - This pasta primavera is fabulous. - Very tasty.<eos> - How did it go with that NBC guy?<eos> Great. Pilot is back on.<eos> In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night.<eos> Hey, listen, Elaine if Russell mentions anything about the pilot you'll, of course, tell him how much you liked it.
He went back to the shop to do some work afterwards.<eos> You don't live in community quarters.<eos> We were assigned a private room. At least we had a little privacy.<eos> There.<eos> That's her.<eos> We haven't picked up anyone.<eos> I can't hold up traffic any longer.<eos> I'm sure he disposed of the weapon before he left.<eos> I heard about the list Quark got.<eos> Rom said it was hidden there during the occupation.
- l don't choose sides.<eos> - Everyone has to choose sides.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> - You knew nothing about a list?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Why would your husband have hidden a list of Bajoran names?<eos> I can't imagine.<eos> Are you sure it was his?<eos> Maybe the Cardassians put it there before they left.<eos> Someone on Bajor told Quark where to find it.
Idiotic bureaucracy!<eos> Now they'll expect me to break in a new man.<eos> Li Nalas can handle the job.<eos> You did fairly well at it once I smoothed your rough edges.<eos> - What's so funny?<eos> - l thought you did fairly well once I smoothed your rough edges.<eos> Am I disturbing anything?<eos> Help me cry in my synthale.<eos> - Here's this epidellic lotion.<eos> - No, if you like it, keep it.
I learned a valuable lesson.<eos> This sharing of thoughts and feelings is quite compelling.<eos> Very.<eos> We'd better get going.<eos> I don't think so, either.<eos> Maybe we can find another way to the village.<eos> No.<eos> It's several kilometres around that ridge.<eos> The border is just two kilometres east of here.<eos> There's a force field protecting it but we can deal with that.
- It is gone, sir.<eos> - Gone?<eos> The distortion no longer registers on our instruments.<eos> Could this distortion be caused by a cloaked ship?<eos> Unknown, sir.<eos> Our understanding of Romulan technology is still limited.<eos> Captain, Romulan ships use a quantum singularity as a power source.<eos> If it is not functioning perfectly or is damaged even slightly, it might show through the cloak as a magnetic disturbance.<eos> The distortion has reappeared, sir, bearing 337 mark 10.<eos> It... It has disappeared again, sir.
- Geordi?<eos> - In here, Data.<eos> Got her now.<eos> She's trapped.<eos> Come on out of there.<eos> Don't you spit at me!<eos> Why is Spot under the bed?<eos> Probably because she knows if I catch her, I'll kill her.<eos> Has Spot misbehaved?<eos> So far, she's broken a vase, a teapot, she's ruined a chair, using it as a scratch post.
Take a shuttle over and I'll introduce you.<eos> - She wants to find me a wife.<eos> - See you at your father's party.<eos> Remember, if you talk to him, it's a surprise.<eos> This came in about three weeks ago.<eos> I never got back to her.<eos> The probe has entered the planet's atmosphere.<eos> I'm ready to take it on board.<eos> If you need a few days off, I'll run the interface.<eos> It's calibrated specifically to my visor's inputs.
I went into the mountains, all the way to the volcano at Kri'stak.<eos> There I cut off a lock of my hair and thrust it into the molten rock that poured from the summit.<eos> The hair began to burn.<eos> Then I plunged it into the Lake of Lusor, and twisted it into this sword.<eos> And after I used it to kill Molor, I gave it a name.<eos> Bat'leth.<eos> The sword of honour.<eos> You know!<eos> The story of the sword is known only to the high clerics.<eos> It was never written down, so that if he returned, we could be sure it was Kahless.
Mrs Budahas has neither seen nor heard from her husband in over four months.<eos> Last month, she contacted the FBI and reported it as a kidnapping.<eos> Why would the military kidnap one of their own pilots?<eos> That's the $64,000 question, Scully.<eos> Since 1963, six pilots have been listed missing in action from Ellens Air Base.<eos> The military say these pilots accepted the risks of flying experimental aircraft.<eos> It's rumored they were shot down at high altitudes while they were penetrating Russian air space.<eos> There were other rumors.<eos> I've been tracking this case since it came through the Boise office.<eos> Last week it was de-prioritized.
Do you have any idea what liver and onions go for on Reticula?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Dana, I've been thinking about this and I have a theory.<eos> It might explain a lot.<eos> Tell me what you think.<eos> What if the guy enters the building...<eos> Hold on a second.<eos> What in the hell is he doing?<eos> That vent is 6 inches by about 18.<eos> Even if a Reticulan could crawl through, it's screwed in place.
Huh?<eos> Hey, kids, don't forget to watch my 29th anniversary show... featuring clips like this one of Sideshow Mel whacked out on wowee sauce.<eos> Everyone's always kissing your ass.<eos> Well, I'm not afraid to tell you you're a--<eos> Oh, I'd give anything to go to that show.<eos> - I'd sell my firstborn son.<eos> - You'll do as you're told.<eos> Ralph thinks I like him, but I only gave him a valentine 'cause I felt sorry for him.<eos> Ah, sweet pity.<eos> Where would my love life have been without it?
This is Chewie, Casper, Chuco, Raymond and Big Happy.<eos> Orale.<eos> Can I talk to you, ese?<eos> Yeah, come here.<eos> You thinking of letting him in, ese7<eos> I told you he was my best crime partner.<eos> He ain't Mexican, ese.<eos> Orale.<eos> So, homes, how's that leg?<eos> Check it out, hard as a rock, ese.
I'll be in in a minute, Dolores.<eos> Hey, why would you need me at all?<eos> Your job here is to keep people away, isn't it?<eos> Oh, the traffic boys, they handle that.<eos> No, sir, I'm just waiting for more of my crew.<eos> Look at that. Even the tires are custom.<eos> Oh, I don't mind admitting, sir, this buggy sure caught my eye.<eos> See, I got a foreign car, too. It's French.<eos> I don't know if you noticed it.<eos> It's parked down there in the street?
And you'd better not let anyone ever see you together again.<eos> Starting today, I'll care for my daughter.<eos> You stay away!<eos> You'd set a bad example and give her bad advice.<eos> You can be sure that I won't let you ruin her life... with this stupid family tradition.<eos> From a distance you can't do much.<eos> Did you ever see prostitutes... allowed near children of decent families?<eos> You really think our family is decent?<eos> My little family is.<eos> And to keep it decent, you'll stay away from my daughter.
Her color, her tone. - You even brought out her cheekbones.<eos> - Well, that's my job.<eos> It was almost a shame to bury her.<eos> It's so sweet of you to say that.<eos> Can I ask you what your secret is?<eos> Spray paint.<eos> You see, you can't just use regular makeup on dead skin.<eos> The pores are too dry. You've gotta use a palette and practically grind the stuff in.<eos> One day I'm in the hardware store and I think to myself, "Hey, what about mannequin paint?"<eos> It's got its own chemical adhesive, comes in an incredible variety of flesh...
What are you waiting for?<eos> Is there a procession?<eos> What a beasts.<eos> Do you know where is a square box where people talk?<eos> Your head?<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Do you know where is a box with a knight that plays music and...? -The musicians will know something.<eos> -Thanks, goodbye.<eos> I'm looking for a box that says the news, but at the same time you can see and there's music.<eos> Have you seen it?
Mrs Harris?<eos> I'm glad you made it.<eos> - Bruce Silverman, Windemere Realty.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Would you care to take a look inside?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm glad you made it.<eos> I was just on my way out.<eos> The house was custom-built two years ago.<eos> It's listed well below market value.
- I'll have diet soda.<eos> I'm on a diet today.<eos> - Since when do you drink diet soda?<eos> Since he started looking so good.<eos> Don't pay attention to him. You look great.<eos> - How's your house?<eos> - It's OK.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - Not too good in daylight.<eos> Just shut your eyes till it's painted.
From Rome,<eos> I've been to St. Peter's and I've seen the Pope.<eos> That little girl... reminds me of someone...<eos> Eat your food...<eos> A doctor in these parts, no names, you might arrest him.<eos> Got invalid pensions for half the village.<eos> He helped a lot of people.<eos> Then the reds held a demonstration saying it's illegal.<eos> Is hunger legal, then?<eos> If there's a law, it must be kept!
He could have reinforcements here the day after tomorrow.<eos> You, sir, pick your man.<eos> Major Hayward will provide a diversion.<eos> I'll draft out a dispatch.<eos> Captain Beams will seek you out and give it to you later.<eos> Something else.<eos> Cameron's cabin.<eos> Frontier cabin.<eos> Came upon it yesterday.<eos> It was burnt out, everyone murdered.
There is an enzyme that should metabolise these fats,... but in ALD boys it's defective.<eos> So they collect in the nerve cells, a little bit like a cluster on the arteries.<eos> And... in some way... this liquefies the white matter of the brain.<eos> "Some way liquefies"?<eos> Could you be more specific?<eos> Well, to be honest, we're not quite certain just how it works.<eos> You know what myelin is? -No.<eos> Myelin is the fatty... sheath that insulates the nerves.<eos> It's a little bit like plastic around electrical wires.<eos> Without it, the nerves cannot conduct an impulse.
Well, I'm paid to nurse, not read stories.<eos> You've decided his mind doesn't need as much nurturing as his body?<eos> What mind?<eos> I beg your pardon!<eos> Nothing.<eos> Get out.<eos> Look, Mrs Odone...<eos> -Just get out.<eos> I've read up on this disease!<eos> I know what it's done to his brain!
- I'm positive.<eos> - Maybe you didn't twist it hard enough?<eos> - I twisted it just right.<eos> How could you be so sure?<eos> If you will look in the manual, you will see that this particular model faucet requires a range of 10 to 16 foot-pounds of torque.<eos> I routinely twist to maximum-allowable torquage. How could you be sure you used 16 foot-pounds of torque?<eos> Because I used a Craftsman model 1019 laboratory edition<eos> Signature Series torque wrench. The kind used by Caltech high-energy physicists and NASA engineers.<eos> Well, in that case, how could you be sure that's accurate?<eos> Because a split second before the torque wrench was applied to the faucet handle, it had been calibrated by top members of the state and federal department of weights and measures to be dead-on balls accurate.
At the service, three people rose... to comment on what an excellent pilot my brother was.<eos> Not my drink, I'm afraid.<eos> I built this myself.<eos> When I was younger... photography was quite an obsession of mine.<eos> You ever seen the work of Mr. E.J. Bellocg?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Well, it's very striking.<eos> Anyhow... photography remained an avocation... not a way of life.<eos> Improves with age.<eos> My friend Jason got his first taste of financial independence... and it was gone with the proverbial wind.
So did you ever get away from here?<eos> Drafted.<eos> Sent me to the Philippines, guard ammunition on the way to the war.<eos> All of us are real proud of how you did on the TV.<eos> Sure.<eos> You know, I never did see your program.<eos> Arlene won't have it in the house.<eos> A critic.<eos> No television, no radio, no liquor, no card playing.<eos> Can't sing a song unless the Lord's name's in it.
That was horrible.<eos> But David, you can't go after a teacher like that here.<eos> It's the end if you do.<eos> My friends back home wouldn't believe this.<eos> Over a failing grade in French!<eos> Good grades. The right schools, colleges, connections.<eos> Those are the keys to the kingdom.<eos> None of us goes off and lives by his wits.<eos> We do what they tell us and they give us the good life.<eos> Goddamn hope we like it when we get it!
- I didn't ask.<eos> He didn't leave a phone number or anything?<eos> You idiot.<eos> That motorcycle could be stolen.<eos> - I don't think this guy was a thief.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - He didn't look like a thief.<eos> - What was he like?<eos> - He spoke french.<eos> - Call in the license plate number. And make sure it hasn't been reported stolen. - Oui, monsieur.
Oh, I'm fine.<eos> May I have the box?<eos> You know it doesn't work. It never did.<eos> That's not important, is it?<eos> What's really important is that none of this ever happened.<eos> This box doesn't exist.<eos> I never saw it before.<eos> Remember that.<eos> Bishop?<eos> All you did was say it was broken.
I tried through a mutual friend. That´s enough.<eos> But they´re probably on the coast.<eos> There´s no way I can reach them.<eos> It´s a pity, it was so pretty.<eos> Told you about it, didn´t I?<eos> Didn´t I ever see it?<eos> I don´t think so, she only gave it to me.<eos> We were standing in front of the school.<eos> That´s when she took the picture.<eos> I remember it quite well. I was quite impressed when I saw it.
Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> It's late.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I'll be up in a minute, honey.<eos> I'm thinking of renting out your side of the bed.<eos> Don't get me wrong.<eos> I like TV just as much as the next person.<eos> It's just there are more things you can do with it than only watch it.<eos> For instance, you can also make money with it.
Feel it burn. [ Explosion ]<eos> Good, Doreen.<eos> Okay, everybody, head spins.<eos> With me. Ready, go.<eos> Very good. Very nice. I like it.<eos> Okay, that's good.<eos> Cool down. Shake it out.<eos> Okay, now vomit.<eos> ANNOUNCER: Kids, now there's a new beer just for you.<eos> It's got no alcohol, but it'll make you act just like Dad.
Yeah, we do, Sam.<eos> Did you know Teresa Banks?<eos> See, I've already gone places.<eos> I just want to stay where I am.<eos> What the hell's that thing doing out there?<eos> You're not taking that body anywhere.<eos> We're taking the body back to Portland.<eos> There's not a thing you can do about it.<eos> Teresa Banks had a ring.<eos> Any idea what happened to it?
They all had blue hair with names like Mushbutt or Silvercrone.<eos> Silvercrone's my maiden name.<eos> She had me!<eos> The good news is Frank Taft was so taken with you, he's considering kicking in halfthe capital.<eos> - Frank Taft... Blue Moon Records?<eos> - We handle him.<eos> - That company's on a roll.<eos> - Major roll. I don't listen to that shit myself...<eos> Sorry, sir. Do you have another card? - What's the problem?<eos> - It's cancelled.
- The Ahmadpura are in Koker.<eos> I already know that they are in Koker.<eos> - This road goes to Koker?<eos> - Yes, it continues from behind of our stores.<eos> The following day, could you see the other match they showed - On television?<eos> - No, all was in ruins.<eos> Not even light was there.<eos> Your television was so broken that you no longer could see the program?<eos> - That's it.<eos> - What happened to it?
You are under arrest.<eos> I did a feature on this place.<eos> It's enormous.<eos> - Like your mouth.<eos> - It's got no windows.<eos> Attention, prisoners.<eos> You are entering the Fortress.<eos> A private maximum-security prison run by the Men-Tel Corporation.<eos> I only bounced a couple of cheques and they give me maximum security.<eos> It's located in a secluded desert.
The bright shade, of some immortal dream. Which walks when tempus sleeps.<eos> The wave of life's dark stream.<eos> You don't really want a husband.<eos> I suppose your journey is to be hazardous at times.<eos> Think, you want a lover.<eos> You've fought in battles? Like a man?<eos> I have fought.<eos> Blood?<eos> If necessary, yes.<eos> Freedom must be taken, if it must be won.
No, it's not cold.<eos> Here it's not cold. Bye,<eos> When are you coming back?<eos> Your hair has grown a lot!<eos> Do you know that in the Northern Hemisphere the water goes down the drain in the opposite direction?<eos> It's the change of weather.<eos> Winters in Canada are terrible.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - The saw.<eos> Lucio had it under his bed.
This he now found.<eos> He transformed the desert into a magic garden in which bloomed women of infernal beauty.<eos> There he awaits the knights of the Grail to lure them to sinful joys and hell's damnation.<eos> He gains control of those he entices;<eos> full many of us has he ruined.<eos> When Titurel, much burdened with age, had conferred sovereignty on his son,<eos> Amfortas could not wait to subdue this plague of sorcery.<eos> You know what happened there:<eos> the spear is now in Klingsor's hands.<eos> If he can wound even a holy man with it he fancies the Grail already firmly his!
Whatever flies I can hit in flight!<eos> You did this?<eos> And you're not worried by the deed?<eos> Punish the offender!<eos> Unprecedented act!<eos> You could murder, here in the holy forest, where tranquil peace surrounded you?<eos> Did not the woodland beasts tamely come near and innocently greet you as friends?<eos> What did the birds sing to you from the branches?<eos> What harm did that faithful swan do you?<eos> Seeking his mate, he flew up to circle with it over the lake and gloriously to hallow the bath.
Sure I do! Your picture's still on the shrine at home.<eos> Really?<eos> It's still there? I'm touched.<eos> You didn't know? But it's a shrine to you.<eos> Why would I?<eos> It's got nothing to do with me.<eos> No? It doesn't? You know that big house on the corner?<eos> Yep, that's my house.<eos> I knew it!<eos> Someone else probably has it now.
Don't want them crunchy.<eos> Not sprouts !<eos> - I hate sprouts !<eos> - Stop whingeing !<eos> Nobody likes sprouts !<eos> Why are we having them, then ?<eos> Because it's Christmas !<eos> We've got guests coming, so I'd better get on with my turkey.<eos> What are you going to do with it ?<eos> It's the season of goodwill, so I'll chop its feet off, rip out its innards, shove an onion up its arse and cook it till it's burnt.
If you ran, we'd hear you coming.<eos> I'm running for Superior Court Judge.<eos> He still could use the exercise.<eos> Will, Carlton... I want you guys to be on your best behavior tomorrow and look presentable.<eos> It's navy-blue jacket, gray slacks, power tie.<eos> Whoa, Uncle Phil, you sure you wouldn't want Carlton to wear Aunt Viv's apron?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, Jazz, I need you to bring over my blue jacket.<eos> Don't worry, man, I'll have it back to you first thing tomorrow morning.<eos> Y ou won't even be able to tell I wore it.
Hey, wait.<eos> What you talking about, your shirt?<eos> You said you weren't gonna buy it.<eos> I said I wouldn't buy it if I were you.<eos> I got the shoulders for it.<eos> That shirt looks good on anyone.<eos> AII the guys in the eighth grade have one.<eos> -I'm gonna take mine back, man.<eos> -Yeah, all right, well, me, too.<eos> You know, I better return mine before my scent overpowers it.
Did you notice anything odd about Everard Fothergill at dinner?<eos> - Well, he was groaning a lot.<eos> - l'm not surprised. lt's because of this.<eos> Everard's father painted that.<eos> He gave it to Everard as a wedding present.<eos> Ah...thus saving money on the customary fish slice.<eos> Shrewd.<eos> - Very shrewd.<eos> - Well, as you can see it's a mess, but being devoted to his father, not wanting to hurt his feelings,<eos> Everard can't have put in the cellar, so he's stuck with it.
- Go on, Bertie.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - Er... dinner.<eos> - Dinner?<eos> This isn't the dining room.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> Oh. I thought I could smell tapioca.<eos> The dining room's over there.<eos> You can't miss it.<eos> There are people having dinner in it.
Businesses were still closed.<eos> We're gonna hit the neighborhood this afternoon.<eos> Well, that'd be helpful.<eos> While you're at it, maybe you could find out what these two uptown boys were doing downtown on Thursday night.<eos> 28th and Lex, it's a hot corner.<eos> What do you think, a drug buy gone bad?<eos> Cecil had a crack pipe in his pocket.<eos> They both had priors.<eos> What about the car?<eos> It's registered to a Laticia Ramis.
My father built that cabin in 1947.<eos> My mother was recuperating from impetigo at the time and Dad thought it would be a good idea to get her out into the fresh air.<eos> She died there the following winter.<eos> And Dad passed away 10 years later to the day.<eos> His last words to me were:<eos> "Cherish the cabin. "<eos> Not, "Take care of your sister. " She's a paraplegic.<eos> But, "Cherish the cabin. "<eos> And I have, for 45 years.<eos> It's often been a sanctuary for me.
She made a big breakfast every Sunday.<eos> I don't know what she put in those eggs.<eos> You come on over. I'll have my cereal, and I'll take your picture.<eos> Really?<eos> Can you take a picture?<eos> He takes good pictures.<eos> He's got equipment there.<eos> - All right. - Yeah.<eos> - I don't know about that outfit, though.<eos> - What's wrong with it?
You'll think of something.<eos> Oh, yeah. I'm a writer.<eos> Were you waiting long at the gate?<eos> I don't even know.<eos> Where's that watch we bought you?<eos> That's it for this piece of junk.<eos> I've had it.<eos> - Is it the one your parents gave you?<eos> - It never works.<eos> It's being fixed.
I'd be happy to. He's a friend of mine.<eos> I'd like to follow the regular procedures.<eos> I don't want any special treatment.<eos> Hey, I'm gonna get that watch back for you by tomorrow, buddy.<eos> - Bring me the receipt.<eos> - I'll get that too.<eos> Be right back.<eos> Look, there's no watch.<eos> I threw it in the garbage can on the street.<eos> My parents gave it to me, but I didn't like it.
- No. Last question.<eos> When do we get to see Krusty?<eos> - Uh, he will be along eventually.<eos> In the meantime, our counselors Dolph, Jimbo and Kearney... will be happy to handle any problems you may have.<eos> Looks like we got ourselves a troublemaker.<eos> You can have the shower to yourself, Homie.<eos> I'm finished.<eos> - Oh, no, you're not.<eos> Here's your cabin.<eos> If you don't like it, T.S.
Data!<eos> What?<eos> Why is the computer creating characters that look like Data?<eos> Where have they taken my son?<eos> Where is he?<eos> Temper, temper, Sheriff.<eos> My pa ain't gonna like it if I come home all bruised.<eos> Worf, wait.<eos> We have to remember, even though the safeguards are off, this is still a program.<eos> If we can get to the end of this story as it was designed, the program will automatically terminate.
No, I'm sorry, Doctor.<eos> Back to square one.<eos> Come.<eos> - You wanted to see me, Captain? - Yes.<eos> Please, sit down.<eos> I find myself having grave concerns about our mission.<eos> Concerns? As to its success?<eos> No, no.<eos> More fundamental doubts.<eos> Whether or not it can be justified.
No question about it, she was bluffing, Worf.<eos> Bluffing is not one of Counsellor Troi's strong suits.<eos> I'm reading chlorinide leakage, but I can't pin it down.
The shearing planes are here, here and here.<eos> How much longer till we can access their logs?<eos> Almost an hour.<eos> The boy was here.<eos> The hallway outside the computer core.<eos> His mother was the systems engineer.<eos> The second away team found her body inside the core.<eos> - And his father?<eos> - Ship's second officer.<eos> He was most likely on the bridge when it was exposed to space.
Long.<eos> It was long.<eos> Yeah. And it had a rectangular shape.<eos> Computer, show me a rectangular conference table.<eos> It's too high.<eos> Computer, reduce the height of the table by 25 percent.<eos> The table was smaller.<eos> And it was inclined.<eos> Computer, decrease the table's surface area by 20 percent and incline the top 15 degrees.<eos> No, it wasn't made of wood.
The engine would ignite the plasma.<eos> Ignite the plasma!<eos> That's exactly what they were trying to do.<eos> Come.<eos> Captain.<eos> Can you tell me what this manoeuvre is?<eos> It's a Kolvoord Starburst, sir.<eos> Five ships crossing within ten metres of each other and igniting their plasma trails.<eos> It's one of the most spectacular and difficult demonstrations in precision flying.<eos> And it hasn't been performed at the Academy for a hundred years.
...and the Dutch and the Portuguese.<eos> It's what all conquerors say.<eos> I'm sure that's what you told that... that... blue-skinned fellow I just saw before you brought him here to serve you.<eos> He's one of the thousands of species that we've encountered.<eos> We live in a peaceful Federation with most of them.<eos> The people you see are here by choice.<eos> So, there are a privileged few who serve on these ships living in luxury and wanting for nothing but what about everybody else?<eos> What about the poor?<eos> You ignore them.<eos> Poverty was eliminated on Earth a long time ago and a lot of other things disappeared with it... hopelessness, despair, cruelty...
Poverty was eliminated on Earth a long time ago and a lot of other things disappeared with it... hopelessness, despair, cruelty...<eos> Young lady, I come from a time when men achieve power and wealth by standing on the backs of the poor where prejudice and intolerance are commonplace and power is an end unto itself and you're telling me that isn't how it is anymore?<eos> That's right.<eos> Maybe it's worth giving up cigars for after all.<eos> Any luck? Not so far.<eos> His activating units won't initialize.<eos> I thought they would have been protected by his buffering program but... I guess 500 years is just too long a wait. What...?<eos> My watch!<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was found in the cavern where Data's head was.
Did you eat?<eos> Yes.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Did you see any car?<eos> No.<eos> Don't worry!<eos> It's all right.<eos> One has fallen down the stairs!<eos> Never mind... I'll go get it.<eos> But it's gone all the stairs down!
She looked so pretty.<eos> I wished I could've died in her place.<eos> I envy you.<eos> At least you had some great years with her.<eos> Me... I couldn't even talk to Tsukishima.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Come here.<eos> What is it?<eos> The school... it's built on top of the burial tomb!
Maybe this isn't an ordinary grave.<eos> It's the same design.<eos> See?<eos> What's this?<eos> This is my dads!<eos> Could he be behind that door?<eos> Let's do it. Let's go through.<eos> But... What if Hiruko comes again?<eos> Yabe took the crown inside...<eos> We need it to capture the goblins.
That's chicken fat, Bill.<eos> My olfactory's turning womanish on me, lying and deceitful.<eos> Still, I must say, I haven't felt a peace like this since the grand productive days.<eos> Don't you find it so, Barton?<eos> Ain't writing peace?<eos> Actually no, Bill.<eos> No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain.<eos> Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man to help somehow ease the suffering.<eos> Maybe it's personal pain.<eos> At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.
- He's worried about the cost.<eos> - What else did he say?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> He talked to Del Webb.<eos> - Did he ask any specific questions?<eos> - He saw the demolished wall.<eos> - What about the header beam?<eos> - He ducked under it.<eos> It's low... too low, unless you're under five foot six.<eos> But it hasn't been fixed yet.
How's Joe?<eos> - We could move him to the table.<eos> - Better not. He might be gut shot.<eos> I've got hot water on the hearth and I've got bandages.<eos> - I don't know much about wounds.<eos> - I do. I've seen a good many.<eos> Been to a lot of shooting towns.<eos> Hurry, ma'am!<eos> Thank God you got a sod roof.<eos> We have to move that coach. They'll burn it and the cabin.
Give me work.<eos> Give me the most abstruse cryptogram, the most intricate analysis and I am in my own proper atmosphere.<eos> Then I can dispense with artificial stimulation.<eos> Would you think me impertinent if I were to put your theory to the test?<eos> I should be delighted.<eos> This watch has recently come into my possession.<eos> Perhaps you'll give me your opinion as to the character and habits of the late owner.<eos> Well, there are hardly any data.<eos> The watch has been recently cleaned, which robs me of my most important facts.<eos> You're right, it was cleaned before it came into my possession.
To the entrance.<eos> The entrance to the old quarter.<eos> We must stop Small as he comes out before he has time to hide the treasure.<eos> Then we'll turn him in for the murder of Wali Dad and Durga Dass.<eos> He'll spend the rest of his life on the Andaman Islands.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No.<eos> Kill him!<eos> Tell him about your leg.<eos> It were torn off in a river.
What have you done?<eos> He stabbed himself.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> My task is done.<eos> And done well.<eos> Where's my piece of the crucifer?<eos> - You have it about you?<eos> - I do.<eos> Give it to me, Mr. Holmes.<eos> Let me die under it as the others did.
Good.<eos> I want you to picture yourself walking down a flight of stairs.<eos> With each step, you'll relax still further.<eos> And as you go down, I want you to tell yourself,<eos> "I am going deeper and deeper into a state of hypnosis. "<eos> Since yesterday you became a bit excited, today I want you to distance yourself from the events you're watching, as if you were only a witness, not an actual participant.<eos> If you do happen to notice any nice little relics or objets d'art along the way, you might just mention them, too.<eos> For Christ's sakes.<eos> At the bottom of the stairs, I want you to picture a door.<eos> This door is very important, because just beyond it lies whatever time or place from your life you wish to visit.
I don't know if this is the most beautiful song, Frankie and Johnny.<eos> I wish they really were your names but I know when my leg's being pulled.<eos> God, how I wish you two really existed.<eos> Maybe I'm crazy, but I'd still like to believe in love.<eos> Why the hell do you think I work these hours?<eos> Anyway, you two moonbeams, whoever, wherever you are, whatever you're doing, this one's for you.<eos> Here's an encore.<eos> You wanna brush?<eos> That means you want me to brush?<eos> Take the blue one, it's never been used.
Unless<eos> - Oh, Evelyn, you don't reckon I'm crazy, do you?<eos> - It was here when I left.<eos> - No, honey, you're not crazy.<eos> This is the place.<eos> Why would anyone want to steal an old lady's home?<eos> Wasn't worth nothin'.<eos> Oh, honey, nobody stole it.<eos> They had to tear it down.<eos> It was condemned.
Right.<eos> Otherwise, what would be the reason for him trying to find you?<eos> I know... what you mean, but...<eos> Guess it's about the right time to eat some kidney beans.<eos> Real stubborn. That's for sure.<eos> "Who needs them!" There's no television.<eos> And that refrigerator, guess how much I had to beg her to buy it?<eos> She still won't go for a washing machine.<eos> "Washing can be done without a thing like that," she says.<eos> A stone head, with a reed screen over it.
Something to do with Shakespeare, or something.<eos> - Oh, Christ, Lorie.<eos> - What?<eos> Your cup.<eos> Your goddamned cup.<eos> So have you heard from Linda?<eos> You know, or you wouldn't ask.<eos> Did you read her letter?<eos> No.<eos> It wasn't addressed to me.
After extensive questioning and a background check the Bureau found no evidence that Mr. Ferrie knew Lee Harvey Oswald or had any connection with the assassination.<eos> The agent in charge would like to make clear that Ferrie was detained for questioning by the District Attorney of Orleans Parish.<eos> I thought we were on the same side.<eos> Why are they saying that?<eos> Pretty fast, the way they let him go.<eos> They must know something we don't.<eos> So let's get on with our lives.<eos> We have homegrown crimes to prosecute.<eos> The President has announced the creation of a commission to probe the events in Dallas.<eos> It will be headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren and is expected to head off several Congressional and Texas inquiries.
That when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector.<eos> He was an intelligence agent for our government and remained one till he died.<eos> So because Oswald pulled the trigger the intelligence community murdered the President? I'll go you one better.<eos> Maybe Oswald didn't pull the trigger.<eos> Nitrate tests indicate he hadn't fired a rifle that day.<eos> And they didn't bother to see if the rifle'd been fired that day.<eos> - His palm print was on it.<eos> - It went to the FBI. FBI didn't find a goddamn thing.<eos> It comes back a week later and a Dallas policeman suddenly finds a palm print?<eos> It could've been lifted at the morgue.
Happy?<eos> You kidding?<eos> Always criticizing!<eos> I forgot.<eos> "Bom" is "fuck you" in Polish.<eos> It's not funny. I almost bought it.<eos> Tragic loss to the art world.<eos> You'll lose them.<eos> Buckle your seat belt.<eos> It's broken!
Oh, man!<eos> Look out, Sailor.<eos> Well, there goes the neighborhood.<eos> Oh, this is bad.<eos> The rain always kicks up my cough.<eos> We'd better get to the mission.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Open up in there!<eos> We're getting wet!<eos> It's locked.
In peacetime I'm a high school teacher.<eos> -Did I speak it right?<eos> -You speak Greek very well.<eos> I learned Greek through books.<eos> The Iliad, the Odyssey, the poets.<eos> I teach about Greece but I've never been here.<eos> With my salary...<eos> Who knows. Maybe this is destiny.<eos> Maybe I'm asking too much.... but... have you seen our church?<eos> It's badly damaged.
I wouldn't want to disturb you.<eos> - I've brought the bread.<eos> - It wasn't worth the time. Take off your shoes.<eos> Bring me the straw.<eos> These plants, they like the silence.<eos> They are born and grow in obscurity...<eos> You promised you'd tell me the story with the kite. - Now?<eos> - Yes, now.<eos> More straw.<eos> When the earth starts to burn, because it is scorched by the sun, humans will have to leave.
Help!<eos> Help!<eos> - Frank Drebin. What do we have here?<eos> - Tense situation.<eos> Savage is in that house.<eos> Says he's got hostages.<eos> Could be bluffing.<eos> - Anything else?<eos> - Yeah. That red van...<eos> It's registered to one Quentin Hapsburg.
You de-ball them in front of everyone.<eos> You are wrong!<eos> - How about a lift?<eos> - Where you headed?<eos> Anywhere but here.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> You're on your own getting back.<eos> I hate that station.<eos> My dad owns it.
Farmers.<eos> - That wood?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Those trees?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - That stream?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Every bit has its history, not just the fields and rice paddies, someone's Great-Great Grandpa planted it, or cleared it, gathered firewood or picked mushrooms there.<eos> I see.<eos> Mankind battles nature and receives from it.
Felix, you reckon that little hump Ricks was making 80 Gs a month?<eos> Imagine what Beniamino takes in through that door.<eos> We roll a grenade, we wouldn't have any more problems with drug sales, right?<eos> OK, here you go, Felix.<eos> That's the slime who killed Stevie, any way you slice it.<eos> Do me a favour.<eos> Call that plate number in.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Nice car.<eos> - I'm glad you like it.
Salaam, little one.<eos> Did God paint you?<eos> Did God paint me?<eos> For certain.<eos> Why?<eos> Because Allah loves wondrous variety.<eos> How is it that a once arrogant young nobleman has found contentment living rough with the salt of the earth?<eos> I've seen knights panic at the first hint of battle. And I've seen the lowliest unarmed squire pull a spear from his own body to defend a dying horse.<eos> Nobility's not a birthright.<eos> It's defined by one's actions.
- Do you know about the chip?<eos> - What chip?<eos> It's at Cyberdyne.<eos> It's from the other one like you.<eos> The CPU from the first Terminator.<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> I knew it! They told us not to ask where they got it.<eos> Those lying motherfuckers.<eos> It's scary stuff. Radically advanced.<eos> It was smashed.
- Me?<eos> Nervous?<eos> Heck, no!<eos> - Sonora?<eos> - Come in!<eos> - You all right?<eos> - I feel great.<eos> Good, good.<eos> - My bathing suit doesn't fit.<eos> - You'll grow into it.
Listen is John there?<eos> No, no.<eos> Oh he's been waylaid somewhere, yeah...<eos> Yeah, I'll tell him.<eos> Alright then, bye now.<eos> Let's drive.<eos> I think we're driving.<eos> Goodnight, Dingo.<eos> I hope you find Paris as exciting as your outback!<eos> You know when I first got this car, everybody thought it was shit 'cos it was made in Germany.
Master, this grave is especially prepared for you<eos> Die in peace<eos> Sorry, I'm late<eos> May I know...<eos> May I know what you are looking for?<eos> Be patient!<eos> You'll see the greatest invention of the world soon<eos> Siu Chuen, what're you talking about?<eos> May's sister is testing her new invention now<eos> It's called "Suffocate bullets"
Now here you are.<eos> I was an art student.<eos> I decided to give up painting when I saw what he could do with his eyes shut.<eos> An artist's work leaps in value after his death. Isn't that true?<eos> Always.<eos> You must be sitting on a gold mine.<eos> Well, do you think I killed him to make money?<eos> I was just thinking out loud.<eos> I could take this painting to any gallery in the world and get $20,000 for it, probably more.<eos> If you take it out, you can keep it.

We will disable part of his network here, where they're weakest.<eos> We'll direct the energy burst at the ship with the android captain.<eos> Sir, the net is picking up activity from the Romulans.<eos> 15 cloaked ships spreading out along the border.<eos> - Signal the fleet to stand by.<eos> - Aye, sir.<eos> Now!<eos> Come to course 080, mark 295.<eos> There's a disruption in the tachyon detectors.<eos> It's localised to this segment of the net.
We get the cold water from the hot tap.<eos> That saves wear and tear on the cold tap.<eos> How do you heat water for the tea ?<eos> We don't.<eos> We have it cold, don't we, Eddie ?<eos> Yes, that's right.<eos> We have it cold...<eos> - But your pilot light's on.<eos> - Is it ?<eos> God, it's caught fire !
Down by the Mirror.<eos> Is he alive?<eos> You just come along with me.<eos> I brought him back here and I sent me wife down to the track for the police.<eos> Did the boy say anything?<eos> No, no, not a word.<eos> He just sat there where you are, sobbing and moaning and I didn't take me eyes off him until they came for him, that's the truth.<eos> Did you examine the gun at all, the butt for instance?<eos> No.<eos> No, not especially, there was a bit of mud on it.
Well, you've had your chance, Inspector.<eos> I'm a practical man, Mr. Holmes,<eos> I cannot undertake to go around the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with the gamey leg, unless I become the laughing stock of Cheshire.<eos> We shall see.<eos> You work your method, I shall work mine.<eos> Now, let us take this morning's work.<eos> From my examination of the ground I gained details as to the personality of the criminal. Uh-huh.<eos> But how?<eos> You know my method.<eos> It's founded on the observance of trifles.
Of course.<eos> And your conclusions?<eos> A girl half asleep, mistook a cat or a bird or both for an intruder.<eos> That's all.<eos> Such a simple explanation, however, it begs the question of the family dog, does it not?<eos> Does it?<eos> What dog? Presbury did not mention Roy's part in this affair is strange.<eos> Clearly a partial witness.<eos> I suggest you ask him. You're not in full possession of the facts of this complex case.<eos> Trust you to say there's more to it than meets the eye, Mr. Holmes.
Is he all right?<eos> He'll live.<eos> A reformed man I have no doubt after his experience.<eos> I quite intended you to have the credit but to complete the case against Dorak, Wilcox and Jenkins, you'll need this.<eos> Here is the incontrovertible proof that those animals you've rescued from degradation were stolen for the sake of their glands.<eos> The animal extract was sold at an enormous profit to those foolish or desperate enough to imagine that a course of serum could restore their lost vitality without any other effects.<eos> I am grateful to you Mr. Holmes.<eos> Thanks to you we've traced the evil to its source.<eos> Perhaps, but poor Presbury.<eos> When one tries to rise above nature, one is liable to fall below it.
Where there is a want of it, we must suspect deception.<eos> Come on Holmes, Miss.<eos> Dunbar is depending on us.<eos> Watson visualize yourself in the character of Miss.<eos> Dunbar with a cold premeditated fashion is about to get rid of her rival. What would be your actions and your thinking?<eos> Well I've written a note.<eos> The victim has come. I've taken the weapon from the gunroom. The crime is done.<eos> Workman like and complete, and now the weapon.<eos> Precisely Watson.<eos> Those depths would hide it forever.
Look, you know, about this homecoming thing... look, I know I said we were gonna go with carlton and his date... but things have changed.<eos> will, you are so wonderful.<eos> Man, you take bad news better than anybody I ever met.<eos> I think it's really romantic that you want to have me all to yourself.<eos> Wait, hold on.<eos> See, that ain't exactly it.<eos> I am so excited about homecoming.<eos> Do you know I worked 80 extra hours just so I couId pay for my dress?<eos> But it is so cute, you're gonna love it.<eos> It's cut very low in the front.
The upshot being that Mr Stoker, with considerable warmth informed Lord Chuffnell that if he supposed that he, Mr Stoker intended to purchase Chuffnell Hall after what had occurred, he was in error.<eos> - Upon this...<eos> - Get it over, Jeeves.<eos> - l can see what's coming.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I agree that the affair has the dark inevitability of Greek tragedy.<eos> His Lordship, I regret to say, became somewhat unguarded in his speech.<eos> - He ticked Stoker off.<eos> - With considerable vigour, sir, stating in an extremely candid manner his opinion of the latter's character, commercial probity and even appearance.<eos> Aah, that must have put the lid on it.
- l'm sure it was all perfectly innocent.<eos> - Innocent!<eos> Don't you care?<eos> I mean, I'm sure nothing untoward happened.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> How dare you?<eos> - Pauline...<eos> - You just take me for granted.<eos> Either that man leaves your house immediately or I do.<eos> Look, this is my house and I'll have whoever I like in it.
(Trembling voice) Very good, sir.<eos> Jeeves!<eos> What on earth's the matter, Jeeves?<eos> - Jeeves?<eos> - l apologise, sir.<eos> It was unforgivable of me.<eos> I shall be better directly.<eos> It's just...<eos> Mr Little's tie, sir.<eos> It has little horseshoes on it.
No, but you said yourself you were looking for woman.<eos> Yeah, but he's a master of disguise.<eos> Clothes... He's got the mannerisms, the voice, all of it.<eos> No, i-it can't be.<eos> But I thought he fell down a mineshaft and was killed.<eos> Uh, Willis, he's also been blown up in a building, consumed by a fireball, he's fallen off a 2, 000 foot mountain, he's drowned and they never find the body.<eos> Well, that's true.<eos> Yeah, considering everything that Pete and I have been through with that guy, I'd say he's got a pretty strong motive for revenge.<eos> MacGyver, at last!<eos> Don't open the door, it's rigged!
This is McDivitt.<eos> - My accountant.<eos> - Good news.<eos> I checked into the capital gains thing.<eos> The I.R.S. will never pick it out as passive income.<eos> We'll put all the debentures on Schedule D.<eos> This is going to save you a fortune.<eos> - You broke the law.<eos> - I didn't break it.<eos> Maybe I bent it a little bit.
You know, Ruth-Anne, you're lucky you're old enough to be a woman.<eos> Come along, Maggie.<eos> I'll take you home.<eos> Maurice, I don't think it's your form.<eos> I think it's your philosophy.<eos> Philosophy?<eos> Yeah, your mind-set.<eos> Man, you're all over the place today.<eos> All right, look.<eos> In kyudo philosophy, you don't really aim at the target, because you gotta become one with it.
I know.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Jerry, let me ask you something.<eos> - Hi, Elaine. - Hey.<eos> This guy leaves this jacket at my mother's house two years ago.<eos> She hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back.<eos> - So?<eos> - Well, I'm not giving it back.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I meet a lot of women in this jacket. They're attracted to it.
But why are you taking an IQ test for George?<eos> Would you please? !<eos> - Is it for a job or something?<eos> - Later!<eos> - You're positive it's statute? - Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> Welcome, welcome.<eos> A steaming hot face cloth...<eos> The door's locked.<eos> Oh, it's locked?
Tonsillitis, adenoiditis is, in Chinese medical terms an invasion of heat and wind.<eos> There's some hot air blowing in here.<eos> You know I lived with the Eskimos many years ago and they used to plunge their faces into the snow.<eos> Can it be lukewarm?<eos> Too much dairy? You really think I'm eating too much dairy.<eos> The tongue.<eos> Yes, the tongue. Or, in medical terms, the glossa.<eos> It's a muscular organ. Consists of two parts:<eos> The body and the root.<eos> You see, it's covered by this mucous membrane. These raised little projections here are the papillae.
"What about the money?" "What's money?"<eos> It looks wonderful on you.<eos> New jacket.<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - It's beautiful.<eos> - Is it me?<eos> - That's definitely you.<eos> - That's more you than you've ever been.<eos> - What is with the pink lining?<eos> - I don't know. It's got a pink lining.
But how we proceed is entirely up to you.<eos> - And if our wishes conflict?<eos> - There'll be no conflict.<eos> And if I should tell you to leave and never return to my world?<eos> We will leave and never return.<eos> Chancellor, we are here only to help guide you into a new era.<eos> I can assure you, we will not interfere in the natural development of your planet.<eos> That is, in fact, our Prime Directive.<eos> I can infer from that directive that you do not intend to share all this exceptional technology with us.<eos> That is not the whole meaning, but part of it.
Still no response, sir.<eos> Increase to warp nine.<eos> - How long, Mr Worf?<eos> - Six hours.<eos> I've got one man unconscious.<eos> We can't stay in here much longer.<eos> If we open that entrance and it's out there, we're dead.<eos> If we all stay in here, we're dead.<eos> It has been over an hour since we heard the entity.<eos> It may be gone.
- If we can avoid firing on it...<eos> - Aren't you going to kill it?<eos> Perhaps you should join me in my ready room.<eos> Why are we pursuing the entity if not to destroy it?<eos> We're not hunters. Nor is it our role to exact revenge.<eos> Do you propose we track it down, greet it warmly and ask it if it would mind not ravaging any more planets?<eos> I don't deny that it may be necessary to fire on it.<eos> - But that is a last resort. - Why?<eos> Why not just kill it?<eos> I want to communicate with it.
Would you care to enclose a letter?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'd like that very much.<eos> Is there something more, Number One?<eos> - Permission to speak freely, sir?<eos> - Of course.<eos> I've been thinking maybe Dr Marr's right.<eos> Maybe we should destroy the entity.<eos> - Why do you think that?<eos> - It's already killed thousands.
A bunch of us are going on an archaeological dig in the mountains.<eos> The Wallaces said it would be OK as long as we had adult supervision, so don't worry!<eos> They're looking out for me.<eos> They're really great people, and I like them a lot.<eos> But they're kinda serious.<eos> They don't have your sense of humour, Mom.<eos> Mom, I miss you.<eos> Captain's log, stardate 45129.2.<eos> We are in pursuit of the crystalline entity.<eos> Data and Dr Marr are prepared to attempt communication when we intercept it.
Pass on the ideals to a new generation.<eos> Work for the day when new thoughts may be spoken aloud.<eos> The Federation will welcome that day.<eos> Captain, we must reach our transport site in 14 minutes.<eos> I wish you well.<eos> Thank you, Captain.<eos> Captain, I will not be coming with you.<eos> Ambassador...<eos> The reason for my coming here was never more clear.<eos> The union of the Vulcan and Romulan people will not be achieved by politics or diplomacy, but it will be achieved.
I just don't wanna stand up there like some deranged Barbie doll, saying things like, "Make sure your campfires are out, kind of like my brain."<eos> - You're terrified of public speaking.<eos> - Yes.<eos> All right, well our forests need saving because of the way people regard them.<eos> Expendable.<eos> If the Ghostwood development cost thousands of lives, do you think it would have a chance of going forward?<eos> Well, trees aren't the same as people.<eos> But they are alive.<eos> Your forest is beautiful and peaceful.<eos> Part of it's been damaged.
- Yeah. - I'm guessing. Maybe it is.<eos> See, two angels...<eos> Two guys named Angel, Spanish guys.<eos> You know what I'm talking about, you fucking cockroach!<eos> - Oh, actual angels.<eos> - Two angels came to me... - Okay. And they told me<eos> "The Lord of Lords and King of Kings is coming to anoint you for the ministry tonight." What form did the angels come in?<eos> How tall? Little tall and strong.<eos> Whatever they told me, I obey.<eos> I don't wanna mess with them.
You shouldn't have done that.<eos> - Please, let me out!<eos> - Get in there!<eos> Wanted to.<eos> Felt good.<eos> - Let me out!<eos> No!<eos> - You got her? I lost two babies to back alley doctors.<eos> No choice.<eos> Never had the chance to fight for them.
We could earn millions just from advertising.<eos> Cheers!<eos> Here's to our grand plan.<eos> When you have earned tons of money, you can be a movie star or even a singer.<eos> Write some good songs and really make a lot of money! But I can't sing...<eos> I'll take you on a space trip.<eos> Space? There's no paparazzi there. Paparazzi?<eos> That's it. The end of the story of my search for my parents.<eos> My four masters became famous after the game.<eos> But you didn't hear what happened between them and Headmaster Wang Biao before the game...
It is always a pleasure when one is on holiday to request a few words of wisdom.<eos> And so without further ado, it is a great honor to hand over to our most distinguished guest.<eos> When she arrives, all eyes are upon her.<eos> When absent, she is the subject of universal conversation.<eos> And what we see her wearing tonight, I look forward to seeing the rest of you wearing tomorrow!<eos> The empress of fashion herself, the Duchess of Devonshire.<eos> We come away to Bath to get away from London, and all of London has come away to Bath.<eos> Somebody did indeed ask me what kind of feather it is that I'm wearing.<eos> Well, there are only two specimens of this rare bird known to man.<eos> One of them has clearly ended up on top of my head.
We differed in our tactics.<eos> They wanted to oust Batista with a general strike, and we wanted to overthrow him with an armed struggle.<eos> And as you can see, our method proved the most effective for removing Batista.<eos> All right, gentlemen.<eos> The provisional government, first, will free all political prisoners, civilian and military.<eos> Second, it will guarantee freedom of information for the radio and press, and individual and political rights established in the 1940 Constitution.<eos> The provisional government will also establish terms for the Agrarian Reform leading to the distribution of public lands.<eos> Have a good trip.<eos> Excuse me, Fidel.<eos> I can't understand how you can meet with those clowns, and much less, how you can make an agreement with them.
Just get out... get out of here.<eos> Ma, you home?<eos> - 911 what's your emergency?<eos> - Damn, what happened to your face?<eos> Where is my mom at?<eos> Well, she picked up an extra shift today. She said she'd be home around midnight.<eos> Yeah. Well, what are you doing here, Clint?<eos> Your mom said it be all right, if I stick around for a few weeks.<eos> Man, I hope you gave as good as you got, man.<eos> You got to stand up to these bastards and give it to them worse than they gave it to you, hmm?
Most people know a lot more about their imaginary friends than that, pal.<eos> You got yourself one hell of a vivid imagination.<eos> 1080, cancel that call.<eos> They were just here!<eos> Look, you know what? Next time, just don't call us.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Wasting my time, man.<eos> Who lives in the apartment next to mine?<eos> Why?<eos> Because I just called the cops on them, and they showed up, and there was nobody there.
This now concludes our broadcasting day.<eos> The last I heard, she went back to Paradise Island.<eos> It sounds like she's lost her mind.<eos> I don't think it's that simple.<eos> Diana's an Amazon who's become an American.<eos> She's trying to make sense of her convictions.<eos> Between her and that Batman character...<eos> I thought these people were your friends.<eos> -They are.<eos> But neither of them would sacrifice their principles for a friend.
As the rainy season ends and the furnace sun resumes its rule, Water evaporates so quickly that a residue of salt forms on the surface.<eos> Each day, the sun bears down and the salt thickens into sheets, like plates of salt ice that shift and grind in the wind.<eos> The sheets drift, blending into a series of small islands as they go.<eos> The wind pushes the islands towards the center of the lake.<eos> After several weeks of intense evaporation, the water in the center of the lake is only a few inches deep.<eos> The floating salt islands run aground on the emerging mud and soon accumulate into a single island of salt, ten miles wide.<eos> Here, remnant water congeals into sulfurous pools, and the temperature regularly rises above 130 degrees.<eos> No land animal could travel Or survive here.<eos> But to the flamingos, this strange, new world is a gift.<eos> There are two million lesser flamingos in East Africa, and every one of them is born here on Natron's secret salt island.
I don't.<eos> I do.<eos> When will we see each other again?<eos> When you change sides.<eos> Want to stay faithful?<eos> Go ahead!<eos> You go your way and I go another.<eos> But we can still have a pizza together with friends.<eos> I'm telling you again, friend, enemy.<eos> We've known each other for so long, why go with them?
It's creating something virtually.<eos> What is it?<eos> You'll see.<eos> I believe it's almost done.<eos> What the hell are you thinking?<eos> Unlike you, doing the job that I was sent to do, stop any further Ori invasion at all costs.<eos> Well, how does getting us killed and this ship destroyed accomplish that?<eos> Oh, I assure you, that's not the plan, Colonel.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Because we're about to be surrounded by a bunch of Ori ships, so I figure we got two options, we can shut that thing down, and hope to outrun them, or we can stay and fight and lose badly.
- And my children?<eos> - They don't need to hear this.<eos> I think they should know. Alright?<eos> I'm sorry, baby.<eos> - How's the pay, as a teacher?<eos> - Johnny, you too.<eos> Stop it.<eos> I'm just asking.<eos> I teach children to make beautiful things.<eos> I bring out the best in them.
I don't mind, honestly.<eos> Come on.<eos> Lindsay, stop messing about there.<eos> All right?<eos> Or you'll just have to sit in the back then.<eos> Oh, Robbie.<eos> Maybe they're just mates.<eos> Don't be a plonker, El.<eos> Mates don't hold hands.<eos> I already feel fed up with boys, and I haven't had anything to do with them yet.
I had to meet someone and the train was late.<eos> sit down please, Miss Robinson.<eos> Can you illuminate, Mr. Jones?<eos> "Julius Caesar," the Mark Antony speech...<eos> "The evil that men do lives on".<eos> Meaning?<eos> Well, I suppose... I tend to remember... the bad things about people rather than the good.<eos> But in the spiritual sense?<eos> Miss Robinson?<eos> Um, people abused, like children abused by devil worshipers, their minds could be permanently scarred... so that the evil lives on in them.
- You were bored.<eos> - Fuck no.<eos> I was happy.<eos> Motherfuckers come to me and say,<eos> "It's a new day, Jimmy,"<eos> talking shit about how it was gonna change.<eos> Shit never fucking changes.<eos> If they had left me up and running when Marlo was on them cell phones, I'd have had him a year ago.<eos> See? But they can't do the right thing.<eos> It ain't in them.
Used to be Marlo's bank, but Marlo ain't around no more and you still moving money for other players, so I'm thinking some of that money need to be mine.<eos> Shit.<eos> You just a boy.<eos> That's just your knee.<eos> That motherfucker shot me.<eos> Nice doing business, gentlemen.<eos> No way, that's bullshit.<eos> I heard it different.<eos> The real story about Omar is that a bunch of cops made it look like them New York boys killed him.<eos> But it was them. They're the ones that really killed him.
That asshole's making up his own shit.<eos> Brass called a press conference for this afternoon.<eos> They'll be shoveling so much money at my bullshit it'll make your head spin.<eos> - What's with all the casework?<eos> - Bodies from the vacants.<eos> - Some still missing lab work.<eos> - Pathetic...<eos> And some of them have been worked pretty good.<eos> You know what, Jimmy?<eos> I'm gonna go back to the beginning and work every one of them again.
- Freeze, right there!<eos> - Whoa, easy, easy, easy.<eos> Drug Enforcement Agency.<eos> Got it?<eos> We're looking for two suspects.<eos> Male, Caucasian, mid-20s, brown hair, blue eyes.<eos> The female is 5'5", 105 if she's a pound.<eos> They're both wanted for murder in California.<eos> They're both armed and dangerous.<eos> One of them just popped this guy.
Sometimes it seems that way.<eos> We've come this far.<eos> We finally have a little one on the way and...<eos> I'm gonna take care of this, okay?<eos> I promise.<eos> I understand you're gonna stick around for a while.<eos> Hopefully only for a couple of days.<eos> Just until we find them.<eos> Well, our captain's put both choppers out.<eos> No sign of them.
Oh, come on, man. Who amongst us hasn't faced temptation?<eos> This isn't about temptation, Omar. It's about security.<eos> Leave aside your friendship for just one moment, my brother, and think.<eos> Think sensibly.<eos> What if he did it deliberately, huh?<eos> Unfortunately his actions have left us with a doubt.<eos> And what does that mean?<eos> We eliminate all doubts.<eos> Ml5 has recovered some files from a hard drive in Nathir's London safe house.<eos> One of them has a record of an operation-
All I have to show is that there's a possible case to be made.<eos> $50,000.<eos> How could you wager?<eos> We're certain to lose.<eos> Not at the summary judgment.<eos> All the facts should be construed in our favor.<eos> We're on the side of the founding fathers here.<eos> The constitution stands for everything that the town of Concord is advocating.<eos> –Let's not overplay the founding fathers.<eos> Most of them had slaves, mistresses.
It's good to be home.<eos> The goods news is that your president, Laura Roslin, is alive and well, as are your crewmates.<eos> She wants the four Cylons that are in this fleet.<eos> She's gonna hold our people hostage until she gets them.<eos> You don't have to do anything except stay out of the way.<eos> I'm already in contact with them.<eos> Now that they realize there's nothing to fear and that we only want to love and protect them, they should find a way of joining us.<eos> I just ask that you don't interfere with any of the shuttle traffic in the fleet.<eos> So your plan is you take these four Cylons and then you head off to Earth, leaving us behind?<eos> Now that's up to them.
Now that's up to them.<eos> All right.<eos> If these four Cylons want to come to you, they're free to do so.<eos> I will not stop them.<eos> Do you agree with this, Admiral?<eos> Agreed.<eos> Well, then I will await them on the baseship.<eos> Laura Roslin needs her medication.<eos> And I need to make sure that she's all right.<eos> - I'm gonna go with them. - No.
alone she sleeps in the shirt of man with my three wishes clutched in her hand the first that she be spared the pain that comes from a dark and laughing reign when she finds love may it always stay true<eos> what a way to discover such a beautiful voice, huh?<eos> How'd you find me?<eos> Your Chief of Staff.<eos> Needs to be horsewhipped.<eos> If you came down here to kiss my ass to get information, save your breath.<eos> The Quorum's considering a vote of no confidence against you.<eos> I won't compromise the success of this operation or the safety of this fleet to indulge the neediness of 12 perpetually unhappy representatives.<eos> I can't.<eos> I was with them on the, uh, emergency jump.
Shouldn't she be on the other side?<eos> Boomer's my pet Eight.<eos> She's seen the light of reason.<eos> And an Eight can make a passionate ally.<eos> Till she sees something shiny.<eos> Why'd you bring me back anyway?<eos> I brought you back to heal us, sister, and end this shameful war.<eos> Since Cylon pilots don't use call signs, we're gonna be painting unique identifiers on all their birds.<eos> That's a relief.<eos> You address them, use that number, okay?
Hello, Tasha! Living my life would be living it with you.<eos> Have you ever heard that?<eos> Come on, what's the point of going to a secret love party without my secret love?<eos> Please, please...<eos> Say yes.<eos> Are you positive that it's safe?<eos> - Yes.<eos> It's famous clositive people.<eos> I think it'll be fine.<eos> You've got nothing on them.
- Yes, I remember.<eos> - I need you to get these instruments.<eos> You'll find them in the drawers in the exam room.<eos> Clamps? Sutures?<eos> Juliet, I don't know what these look like.<eos> I can help you. I'm familiar with surgical instruments.<eos> I thought you were a physicist.<eos> Yeah, well, I've done some animal autopsies, too, so...<eos> - No.<eos> - We can't trust them.
Does it involve you raising $3.2 million?<eos> That's a lot of money.<eos> Wait.<eos> Maybe this will get you started.<eos> Put your laundry and dishes by the door.<eos> I can help you, John.<eos> We have shared interests.<eos> - Or at least a common enemy.<eos> - Our friends on the freighter.<eos> Not them.
The mike was smashed up pretty good.<eos> Best case scenario, we'd only be able to broadcast tone squelch.<eos> Beeps and boops.<eos> Yeah, but you could still use it as sort of a telegraph, right?<eos> If I had some strips of ferrous metal, a nine-volt battery clip and some wiring...<eos> We got a bunch of stuff we salvaged from the plane.<eos> - Great.<eos> - I'll show you where it is.<eos> Bernard, you got a second?<eos> These people, you're scared of them, aren't you?
- Supplies.<eos> For?<eos> I don't want to get caught flat-footed again.<eos> - You know what that means?<eos> - No.<eos> Well, these people obviously have a plan.<eos> We're gonna need one, too.<eos> Does that plan include screwing over James?<eos> - Is it James or Gary Miller?<eos> - Whatever his name is, there's a part of me that doesn't want to believe he works for them... 'cause he's the man I loved, the man who went to prison for me, the man who was going to take me to my first trip to Paris.
- Someone has to be look...<eos> - I'll take care of it, go.<eos> Look, maybe you got a wife to get home to.<eos> Family.<eos> If you give me the name of your accomplice, I think we can change your charges.<eos> - We work together. Help each other out.<eos> - You're on your own.<eos> You holler if you change your mind.<eos> Let's talk about the fifth cardholder.<eos> The general is requiring all the cardholders to have their cards on them at all times.
- Lale!<eos> I like him.<eos> He's great!<eos> You like anyone who buys you a drink!<eos> Oh, go ahead and die, see if I care!<eos> And now, please...<eos> silence in the atmosphere.<eos> Resolve the conflict in the swimming pool, please.<eos> With us here tonight are artists from the Serbian entertainment industry.<eos> Among them is the famous poet, Mr Ljubiæ!
Muslims.<eos> - The ones that are tied up?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Who are the guards?<eos> - Also Muslims.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> The ones that are tied up are Babo's.<eos> - Whose?<eos> - The prisoners are from Kladuša.<eos> The guards are fighting against them, they are from Tuzla and Bihaæ.
No, no, no, you don't have to.<eos> If you'll excuse me, Mr Smith,<eos> I was just thinking about the day my husband was shot.<eos> His name was Oliver.<eos> He died at the Battle of Spion Kop.<eos> We were childhood sweethearts.<eos> But, you see, I was angry with the army for such a long time.<eos> And you still are.<eos> I find myself as part of that school, watching boys learn how to kill.<eos> Don't you think discipline is good for them?
Use the countdown.<eos> I told them that if everyone thinks of one word, at one specific time...<eos> Nothing will happen!<eos> Is that your weapon?<eos> - Prayer?<eos> - Right across the world.<eos> One word, just one thought, at one moment, but with 15 satellites.<eos> - What?<eos> - The Archangel network.<eos> A telepathic field binding the whole human race together. With all of them, every single person on Earth, thinking the same thing at the same time.
Huuuuuu-maaan!<eos> Huuuuuu-maaan!<eos> Hunt!<eos> Hunt!<eos> Hunt!<eos> Hunt!<eos> There's movement on the surface.<eos> Another human hunt, God help him.<eos> Chan, should I alert the guards, tho?<eos> No, no, we can't spare them.
Is that a no?<eos> No, I'm not going to work for you.<eos> You're going to work for me.<eos> You're going to show me everything you do, everything you know, and I'm going to use it to help me stop Sylar.<eos> And why would I do that?<eos> You raided my father's office in Chennai, planted Eden as my next door neighbor.<eos> You want what I have, the formula.<eos> I can find more of them.<eos> You're the one who needs me.<eos> Some people died because you led Sylar right to them.
You can't stop the boogeyman.<eos> He sees into your soul, and then he eats your brain.<eos> Well, you know who can stop the boogeyman?<eos> You.<eos> I hear you have an amazing ability.<eos> It's not so amazing.<eos> They ask me where people are, and I find them.<eos> You find them?<eos> What? Anywhere in the world?<eos> Yeah, I just think about them, and then I know where they are.
What's the job, honey?<eos> Well, I was having drinks with Hugo Gray, right?<eos> Who's this Hugo Gray?<eos> He runs an online magazine.<eos> Rory has been writing pieces for him.<eos> So, we were just talking about different opportunities that might come up and where I've already applied and he mentioned that the reporter that was covering the Barack Obama campaign for him dropped out because his fiancée got a job in Dubai, so they're moving. Wow.<eos> So, then Hugo asked me if that was something I'd be interested in and I said "yes. I would be interested" And he told me more about it and apparently I would be on the campaign trail with the other reporters, the planes, the buses, the whole deal.<eos> And I mean it's only an online magazine, so I wouldn't be staying where the Wall Street Journal people stay at night but...<eos> Who cares?<eos> But I would be traveling with them.
She's my patient, the donor.<eos> So if you need any information, I have it, all of it.<eos> She's my patient.<eos> You've got some eager junior residents around here.<eos> Lucky me.<eos> Take your pick.<eos> Well, Yang, I appreciate the offer, but I date man<eos> So I don't think you'll be able to impress me the way you've impressed your mentors in the past.<eos> I... what ?<eos> You sleep with them, right ?
I was debating whether or not to acknowledge the... the climate that we were in at the time.<eos> By climate, you mean the SEC was about to expose your accounting fraud.<eos> Objection.<eos> For me to ignore the pending sec report would have threatened my credibility, so in my final speech,<eos> I decided to mention the investigation and even a... possible action against us by the sec.<eos> But... you also continued to insist that your company was financially sound?<eos> - Yes<eos> - And your employees trusted you?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> For almost 35 years, they knew that I was fully committed to them.
Something like this happens, it gives us all pause.<eos> Needless to say, we've been forced to regroup.<eos> New attorneys are just beginning to familiarize themselves with Mr. Frobisher's case.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> The trial was set for the end of next month and I see you're requesting a six-month extension.<eos> Mr. Shayes?<eos> Well, first of all, let me express my condolences to the entire firm.<eos> We respect the difficult position Mr. Phillips finds himself in.<eos> We understand the challenge of getting new team members up to speed, but... our responsibilities lie with Mr. Frobisher's 5,000 employees who can't pay their bills.<eos> For them, justice delayed...
Are you going to go back to Patty?<eos> This is the kind of work that I want to do, David.<eos> Patty may be a horrible person, but... these guys are ruthless.<eos> I don't know what you are doing anymore.<eos> I know exactly what I'm doing.<eos> Really?<eos> A man's dead now.<eos> Was that the plan?<eos> You of all people should understand after what they did to Katie.<eos> I don't care about them; I care about us.
would you like a beer,tommy?<eos> No.I,uh...<eos> I can't stay.<eos> Walking out of your own last supper?<eos> Hey.<eos> You pulled the settlement.I thought we were going to work this out.<eos> Oh,we've still got a long road ahead of us.<eos> - Win or lose,you'll be taken care of. - Don't worry about it.<eos> I'm not just in this for myself,I work with those people.They're friends.<eos> - And I tried to be fair with them,didn't I?
It's going to be difficult without you.<eos> Well,andrew's capable,and,uh,felicia.Give her a couple months.<eos> It's a huge difference between being number one and being number two.<eos> Yes.There is.<eos> You're a number two,tom.<eos> That's your talent.That's your limit.<eos> - This is what yocameu here to tell me?<eos> - No.<eos> I came because I care about the clients.<eos> I only want what's best for them.
Next time I see you,hewes shayes better be on that door.<eos> Hewesit's early.<eos> Yes,it is.<eos> So,you have your negotiating points?<eos> There's no room to negotiate here.<eos> Partner.<eos> - I just spoke to the clients.<eos> - Really?<eos> What did you say?<eos> I told them... that no one will fight for them like you.
Set this up for me.<eos> Get me a writer, and stop being an asshole.<eos> You're being an asshole.<eos> She spat at me!<eos> You know something? She spat at me.<eos> In front of my kids.<eos> The book's a good idea.<eos> I can't wait to read it.<eos> You still awake?<eos> Demonstrators say if the three buildings behind them and one other come down this week, it could be a very long time before anything goes up in their place because there are a number of lawsuits against the Atlantic Yards project
You're firing me?<eos> My daughter went to prom with you, I drove you there myself.<eos> That was 20 years ago.<eos> I tried to do you a favor here, and it just didn't work out, okay?<eos> Turn your shirt in to gloria, and I'll pay you for the week.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - So I called your parents.<eos> They were already on their way.<eos> But you told them i couldn't have lunch.
Mr. Monk and I have to be together because he's the navigator.<eos> So Ridley, you go with Natalie.<eos> Uh, yeah, whoa...<eos> No, no, I will, uh...<eos> - Pez and Ridley, you guys take my car.<eos> - Good idea.<eos> Wait, no, no. Um...<eos> Help me out...<eos> We had two bad guys in the bank.<eos> Guard shot one of them.
There we go.<eos> Wednesday. 9:18 in the morning. Two Caucasian males enter the Vinton Street branch.<eos> They pistol-whip Steven Connelly, the assistant branch manager.<eos> Yeah, and guess who his brother is.<eos> Happy Jack Connelly.<eos> Remember him? Uh-huh.<eos> 9:21. It all hits the fan. Security guard gets off one round.<eos> This guy, the guy in the green ski mask is hit, we think in the chest.<eos> They kill the security guard. Grab the cash. Two minutes later, they're gone.<eos> Yesterday, Thursday, we find one of them in a parking lot dead as dust.
- Oh, our situation.<eos> I get it.<eos> You don't want to talk about what happened in front of the w-h-o-r-e.<eos> - I can spell, you know.<eos> - Of course you can.<eos> - Is that Charlie Sheen?<eos> - Where?<eos> Right there by the elevator.<eos> That's weird.<eos> Uh, so Mr. Doyle, both men were questionned, and apparently, there's no way that either one of them stole anything from Patsy or Rita's room.
Well, I was on my way out. And then I started looking around the hotel.<eos> Do you know how much environmental impact it has?<eos> We're a city in a desert.<eos> If Vegas didn't impact the environment, there wouldn't be any Vegas.<eos> It's a lot more complex than that.<eos> I really wanna do something, Danny.<eos> Ok.<eos> Great.<eos> Do you know how many toxins there are in these cleaners?<eos> We shouldn't even be standing near them.
Dwight, you ignorant slut.<eos> Depression is a very serious illness.<eos> Over 32,000 people commit suicide every year, according to a 2004 study.<eos> Is that the last year to date it was available?<eos> Yes.<eos> My head is in such pain and turmoil!<eos> Don't do anything rash.<eos> Dwight, where are the warehouse guys?<eos> I didn't...<eos> I didn't think you needed them for this part.
Sometimes it's very ugly and unfair.<eos> That's... life!<eos> My dad served in Vietnam.<eos> He put his life on the line.<eos> But instead of coming home to a hero's welcome, he found a country that was either ashamed of the war or just wanted to deny it, deny him.<eos> And I fear that our soldiers in Iraq could face the same thing.<eos> And we seem to be in such a hurry for this thing to be over with, so we can go back to pretending... see, in Vietnam, soldiers didn't survive.<eos> But today they do.<eos> And they come home missing legs and arms and eyes... you know, and not much to cling to.<eos> They need us to be proud of them.
Oh, come on.<eos> You got at least five, 10 good years left in you.<eos> I mean I won't be around once this case ends,<eos> So a reaming will be good practice for you after I'm gone.<eos> I better refrigerate this.<eos> Taking a life is one thing,<eos> But the care and feeding of it is another.<eos> I can't keep my problem locked away in a cabin forever.<eos> Harry always said There were plenty of people who deserved to die, But no matter how hard I close my eyes and wish,<eos> Doakes isn't one of them.
You get out, now.<eos> The bed's been stripped.<eos> We've lost all of our trace evidence.<eos> Who is in charge, Mr. Feldron, when you're not here?<eos> My night supervisor, but she went home.<eos> Well, then get her ass back here, and I want every surveillance tape you have within the next five minutes.<eos> I'm sorry, but our security system has been down for months and corporate won't pay to fix it.<eos> Well, then how do you propose we find the perv that raped that boy?<eos> Take your pick. I've got 50 hard-core sex offenders locked up here.<eos> Then I'm gonna talk to every single one of them tonight.
- In that bookstore in Gulfport.<eos> What happened?<eos> I saw Francine.<eos> She was in the store reading my book Bridge to Nowhere.<eos> Those boys were gathered around her.<eos> She was in terrible danger.<eos> - What did you do?<eos> - Took her someplace safe.<eos> But they found us.<eos> Two of them held me down and the other one raped her.
I'm so glad that I found you.<eos> Who's my buddy?<eos> Who's my buddy?<eos> What's up with the redecorating?<eos> - Just putting Virginia back where she belongs.<eos> After tonight, she deserves to be up there.<eos> Yeah, funny thing about tonight...<eos> What a coincidence that these votes were hidden in the fireplace.<eos> I know, right?<eos> - And what's more impressive is one of them's in Casey's handwriting.
It's called "Leading A Good Life."<eos> it is a catchy title.<eos> It sounds positive.<eos> Oh, it is.<eos> It's an "edu-taining" musical that covers everything from dental hygiene to menopause.<eos> Well, these kids could use some old-fashioned values.<eos> It would be perfect.<eos> I don't know.<eos> The Bible Bunch kids are serious at-risk youths.<eos> I mean, some of them are gang members.
- Well there's that.<eos> - Thanks anyway.<eos> - I'll cheer him on from down here.<eos> - That's all right, Bill.<eos> - We understand.<eos> - I got to get after the accumulation.<eos> They're crap machines. My birds, they're crap machines.<eos> You do good, Shaunie.<eos> Drive safe.<eos> Good for them.
What does that have to do with anything?<eos> Well, I've been doing some digging, and the company that bought LWK is a subsidiary of Madacorp.<eos> - That must be...<eos> - Another coincidence?<eos> Start a list.<eos> Kyle's father?<eos> Here's one about his mom.<eos> I found 15 different articles on Kyle's parents over the past several years, all of them glowing tributes.<eos> So what's the problem?<eos> Every one of them was distributed on the web on the same day, like they were deliberately planted.
The results of his MRI when I first took him on as a patient showed an unprecedented amount of brain activity, but the second MRI, months later, was normal.<eos> He sleeps in a tub.<eos> Let's start with that.<eos> And I think we can scratch "normal" off our Kyle adjective list.<eos> I'm less concerned about his idiosyncrasies than I am about some of the more disturbing things he's been involved with.<eos> He was found wandering near Kearn's skeleton.<eos> Professor Kearn... taught at U-Dub, where he mentored a student named Adam Baylin.<eos> Who looked just like Kyle.<eos> And kidnapped him, raising him for five years until he committed suicide.<eos> And he comes to us with no memory of any of this until his parents suddenly show up, and he leaves with them.
It's so good to see you again.<eos> - How long can you stay?<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> Why didn't you tell me you were coming?<eos> Did your parents come with you?<eos> Let's give this guy a chance to catch his breath here.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I'll never forget that look on their faces, the joy and relief.<eos> They seemed so happy to see me.<eos> I wanted to tell them the truth about everything that had happened, but I wanted to be at home with them even more.
All these vegetables were picked this morning.<eos> I partake.<eos> I partake.<eos> What were those exercises?<eos> The "merci" exercises? What?<eos> Sakura-san made them.<eos> We do that every morning.<eos> Every morning?<eos> Right.<eos> Our spring days can't start without them, can they?
- No, no, no, one more.<eos> What?<eos> He's gay?<eos> What about it?<eos> Nothing, I'm just looking out for you.<eos> I mean, does he wanna take you sailing, or does he wanna take you sailing?<eos> Don't be silly. He knows I'm not gay.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> For 16 years, he didn't know he was gay.<eos> You don't believe two men can be friends, just because one of them is gay?
She's on her way.<eos> Glad you picked up, Sergeant.<eos> How are things?<eos> - You have 15 minutes.<eos> - Look, we've got roadblocks up.<eos> We're gonna need an additional half hour to get her here.<eos> I said 15 minutes!<eos> He hung up.<eos> They're stalling!<eos> After everything I did for them!
- Yeah!<eos> Look, we've got to get the kids and you got to get out of here.<eos> Where are we going to go?<eos> There's a safe house I know of. If we could just get there. It's in Montana.<eos> Go to Montana on these roads?<eos> What are our chances of getting there?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - You heard from Constantino?<eos> - No, no, but I... sent out a squad of rangers to try to take out the mortars.<eos> I should have been with them.
Previously on Studio 60:<eos> Jack, the show's not going to be good on Friday.<eos> It can't be.<eos> Doesn't have to be good.<eos> Just has to be on.<eos> Wes Mandel is recovering from a heart attack, which means you two are in charge of the most valuable property this network has ever owned.<eos> You don't take shots at Bush, you don't take shots at America.<eos> Feel free to make fun of Hollywood.<eos> Three American soldiers were ambushed in their truck on a road in Paktika, Afghanistan.<eos> One of them is Mark Jeter.
We're gonna stop four kids getting jumped into a gang.<eos> Stop them young, less problems when they're older.<eos> Now, we might not see results tomorrow but things are gonna look a lot better over time.<eos> - Hey, the cops are coming.<eos> Come here.<eos> - What you doing, man? - He ain't complaining.<eos> He doesn't need to.<eos> I saw it with my eyes.<eos> - What do we do with the little ones?<eos> - Can't hold them on anything.
We need to reduce the number of bodies in the compound.<eos> Do you have a problem with that, sir ?<eos> Dear, these men are just doing their jobs.<eos> Can't risk it, Jonas.<eos> Not based on this medical report.<eos> A piece of paper doesn't get the mission done, sir.<eos> Half your operators can't pass that physical.<eos> Let's let the air force run with this one.<eos> There are only 3 guys that know the details of this operation.<eos> And one of them is now dead.
Third: find out where it's coming from.<eos> I'll get TIGR to sequence the genome, see if we can't figure out this antibiotic resistance problem.<eos> Good. I want Bob figuring out a way to kill this thing.<eos> Alright, every antibiotic and cocktail possible tested.<eos> We'll work up some kill curves?<eos> Tell him to keep elevating the concentrations until it dies.<eos> - What about the source?<eos> - Get Mayko on it.<eos> I got her access to all the patient's personal and medical records.<eos> Have her find any and everything that connects them.
Yes, I am.<eos> Black or white?<eos> Just limp away.<eos> He doesn't want to play.<eos> Leave him alone. Pick one, or this comes out.<eos> And for all you know, this is really important.<eos> Stop it!<eos> That hurts, right?<eos> Which is odd, because I'm really enjoying this.<eos> You hold the pieces that way because you can't bend your thumb, because your bones have formed abnormally, thanks to all the crap that's been pushing its way in between them.
I had a management job.<eos> I've always moved up and it happened quite rapidly.<eos> But with these changes, I've lost my position and now I'm nothing.<eos> Of course... the reason I've lost everything,<eos> is because... of the position I took that put my job on the line.<eos> I am paying the consequences.<eos> I was an executive and... I lost everything.<eos> I am nothing now.<eos> I have a clan, I have men.<eos> I want to start from scratch with them and rebuild.
I called you in to tell you I'm allowing the government to put on a witness, an army colonel.<eos> - To say what?<eos> The other side.<eos> He'll be taking the stand.<eos> You officially have notice.<eos> That's all.<eos> Do most lawyers really take their pants off for you?<eos> Why not?<eos> It's exciting.<eos> For them?
Of course, Jezzie.<eos> First of all I want you to meet our lovely new neighbours.<eos> This is Danny, this is Evelyn,<eos> Zoe, and--<eos> Uh, Mark.<eos> You're beautiful.<eos> My name's Mark, mum,<eos> Mark Brogan.<eos> One-nil to Meadowlands.<eos> Shall we join them?
The younger tylosaur is mortally wounded.<eos> But his story isn't over.<eos> His final fate was recorded in stone.<eos> A shark's tooth lay near the fossil.<eos> Look at this.<eos> The female moves on with the others.<eos> Soon the scavenging will begin.<eos> The young dolly has seen the deaths of her mother and brother... but she survived.<eos> Each year, marine reptiles gather again... in the birthing grounds of the shallows.<eos> Among them is the dolly with the wounded flipper... now fully grown.
She's on her way.<eos> We're still looking into this Dr. Reisen.<eos> And... Commander Taylor said he's checking into Baxter's claim that he filed a complaint.<eos> Thank you, Sergeant.<eos> These files the manager gave us?<eos> I looked into Summerview's financial records for all seven victims, and Baxter was right.<eos> They were all on Medicaid.<eos> Only problem?<eos> There are currently 11 other residents at Summerview who are also on Medicaid.<eos> Several of them for years.
I think he's killing those people.<eos> Charlie.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> He's killing...<eos> He's probably eating them too, dude.<eos> And although I think eating people is very cool, not if we're involved.<eos> No, Charlie, he is not killing anybody, okay?<eos> We're accomplices.<eos> No, we are not.<eos> He told me these are people from his past, and he's got to take care of them.
I have my own relationship with Ben, and you're just jealous 'cause it don't include you.<eos> You call her dad "Ben"?<eos> I'm not a child.<eos> That's his name.<eos> So, when are the boys showing up?<eos> They're gonna meet us at the Chili Parlor.<eos> Maybe they can bring some pot.<eos> Fuck that. No.<eos> I don't wanna be either A, depending on their fucking ass, or B, depending on their ass.<eos> If we don't score ourselves, we're gonna be stuck with them all fucking night.
So you wanted to skip the line and take the fast track.<eos> And when you were caught breaking the law, the defendant helped you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Who's idea was it to seek sanctuary in the church?<eos> Father McClinton's.<eos> He said the church could provide protection while we find another way for me to stay.<eos> Ms Lopez, why did you come to the United States?<eos> There is no work in Mexico.<eos> My brothers have to travel far to find jobs, construction, farming.<eos> It is very hard on them, and they earn nothing.
- The police? - You never called the police?<eos> - I've told you, there's something wrong.<eos> - I can smell it on her.<eos> No! I've told you, she's a weirdo.<eos> - Sarah Jane Smith?<eos> - He's here.<eos> What's going to happen?<eos> The police will take us to the station.<eos> They'll question me and you'll see your parents.<eos> So why can't I remember them?
Or worse, try on your grandma's clothes and wait for little red riding hood to come by.<eos> Janet gave her... forget it.<eos> Oh.<eos> Forgotten.<eos> So listen, change of plans.<eos> Unfortunately, Christine's being very difficult.<eos> She's insisting I bring the twins tonight instead of tomorrow.<eos> - Ray, it's Christmas eve.<eos> - I know, but... there's the roofing emergency I need to deal with at the rec center, so I figured, you know, it's better to give in.<eos> Besides, it'll be easier on you-- less work without them.
You might make it out of here in one piece.<eos> Oh, crap.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> That's Glen Shipley.<eos> I know him.<eos> When I knew Glen, he was a Camden scout.<eos> Even though you only had to wear your uniform if you were going to a scout meeting,<eos> Glen was so proud, he wore it every day.<eos> You see, the regular scouts left Camden County years before when a local militia group got caught using the scouts to round up illegal aliens.<eos> so, in Camden, we had Camden scouts, and back when I was an amateur criminal, I often used them as unknowing accomplices.
Maybe if you had as many jobs as you do illegitimate children, you wouldn't live in a camper.<eos> No offense, Darnell.<eos> - This is between you two ladies.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Are you all here to watch me and Earl do one of them super-slow run and hugs, like they did in that movie Cherries of Fire?<eos> I've been practicing.<eos> That's sweet.<eos> I wish our boys would bond as brothers.<eos> They keep playing this game called "eye pok."<eos> It's all fun until one of them gets poked in the eye.
And so I convinced the warden to get another ball.<eos> That way both gangs could play and everyone would be happy.<eos> More balls.<eos> Too many balls.<eos> Hey, Earl.<eos> Your ex-wife and current brother are here to see you.<eos> They, uh, they look mad.<eos> Why can't people just be nice to each other, Ron?<eos> People need guarding, Earl.<eos> That's all I know about them.
You guys know lzzy hates it down in day care.<eos> Ain't that right?<eos> Do you wanna come live...<eos> Elliot wasn't the only one trying to steal babies from the hospital.<eos> Hey, don't steal those babies.<eos> Why do you call these babies?<eos> It could be that when I was a kid, I didn't have any toys.<eos> - Sure, sure.<eos> Yeah. - I used to make my own toys as a matter of fact, and I would take the toilet paper rolls and draw little faces on them and name them.<eos> Surround myself with them, hoping they would protect me.
Then that makes us cousins.<eos> Jor-El never mentioned your dad.<eos> He and his brother never talked.<eos> Why?<eos> The House of El has a lot of family secrets that nobody ever discussed.<eos> As humans would say, we were dysfunctional.<eos> Look, I'm sure you have a lot of questions, but right now we need to find my ship.<eos> I'd do it myself but those green rocks, they keep weakening me.<eos> And trust me, you wanna stay away from them.<eos> If you're around them too long, they can kill you.
I'll be dead by Christmas.<eos> Celebrate Christmas, Lane?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We used to send out the Christmas portrait every year.<eos> Me in an ugly sweater, mom with her fake smile, and dad... missing his football game.<eos> Then you must know how it feels when one of them is in danger.<eos> You'd think.<eos> After I escaped from LuthorCorp, I went looking for them...<eos> My parents, my Christmas memories... it's all a fiction some scientist downloaded into my brain.<eos> Yet, I remember them like they're real.
You have to actually ingest the blood to be infected.<eos> Good thing, too.<eos> We'd have had to kill you.<eos> - The attack?<eos> - She jumped me, then bit me.<eos> Then those two guys found me and chased her down the alley.<eos> - What did they look like?<eos> - I didn't get a good look.<eos> Think.<eos> One of them was real tall.
- What?<eos> - You're crazy.<eos> - Tell me.<eos> I swear, if you ever tell dad I told you any of this, I will end you.<eos> Promise.<eos> First thing you have to know is we have the coolest dad in the world.<eos> - He's a superhero.<eos> - He is?<eos> Yeah. Monsters are real.<eos> Dad fights them.
- You with the bosses?<eos> There a retaliation plan?<eos> Not the regs. That shit burns like garbage.<eos> - Garbage?<eos> - Mak e sure you got them in stock.<eos> Found your cigars.<eos> These the addresses for the bosses?<eos> Bueno, put two aside for me.<eos> Don't forget me.<eos> Pick you up with the rest of them?
This wasn't my house ten years ago.<eos> It's my husband's house.<eos> I moved here after we were married.<eos> I was the one who had the relationship with tim.<eos> Luke,these are the detectives i told you would be stopping by.<eos> Detectives,this is my husband,professor luke dujardin.<eos> We're both on staff at u.S.C.Particle physics.<eos> But we are not actually on staff there.<eos> We are just more likely to be on staff there than not to be on staff there.<eos> Don't play with them,darling. They're not your students.
* sweet hour of prayer * * sweet hour of prayer *<eos> my dad used to sing it to me when we camped when i was a kid.<eos> it's pretty. go on.<eos> - are you sure?<eos> - yeah.<eos> * that calls me from * a world of care * * and bids me at * * my father's throne * * make all my wants * * and wishes known * * in seasons of * * distress and grief *<eos> * my soul has often found release * it's not amir.<eos> it's not jeffrey.<eos> three surf rats at that _BAR__BAR_s station.<eos> one of them ends up here dead.
She won't be bothering anyone anymore,sir.<eos> She was killed last night.<eos> My god.<eos> Poor thing.<eos> Couldn't have been much older than nate.<eos> Well,if you can think of anything that might help at all.<eos> Anything at all.<eos> Sad,really.<eos> These kids,living on the streets.<eos> No parents to take care of them.
The killer ran away.<eos> Did the 911 caller report anyone running away?<eos> Just spoke to her, Ida Martinez.<eos> Confirmed seeing some black gang members in a gray truck.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> There was a vehicle involved?<eos> She saw the truck two days ago.<eos> It drives up and down her street occasionally.<eos> You know, with black gangsters, guns hanging out the window.<eos> So when she heard the gunshots she just assumed it was them.
Burned to death in a fire.<eos> What did these people believe?<eos> They believed that a messiah would return from the dead and lead the world to salvation.<eos> Not the proudest branch on my family tree, but people are interested in this stuff, so I keep it around.<eos> This was their scripture, and this was the messiah they were waiting for.<eos> Yeah, that looks like Jordan Collier.<eos> You're not the first person to mention a resemblance.<eos> I don't know, maybe.<eos> Feel free to thumb through the book if you'd like.<eos> A few of the chapters are too charred to read and one of them is written in a-- l don't know. --a code or something, but there's enough for you to get the gist.
Not Only That, My Severance Package Has A Morality Clause.<eos> My Stock Options, Pension, All Of It Will Be Gone.<eos> Well, Lucky For You, I Know The Guy That Runs The Evidence Lock-Up In The 22nd Precinct.<eos> So I Will Pay Him A Visit.<eos> That's What A Good Friend Does.<eos> One Misguided Night With A Tranny,<eos> And It Haunts You For Life.<eos> At This Point, My Relationship With Dontrelle Has Lasted Longer Than My Second Marriage.<eos> What Is It About Men That Makes Them Think That The Answer To All Life's Problems Is A Frat Party?<eos> Go Easy On Them.
He can help.<eos> Oh,yeah,sure.<eos> Yesterday he taught the boys how to burp the national anthem.<eos> Not the right kind of help.<eos> I'm the only one who puts batteries in the smoke alarm,the one who puts the cover on the swimming pool at night.<eos> Have you tried talking to patrick?<eos> Oh,he says I'm just being silly because nothing bad ever happens.<eos> But that's only because I make sure nothing bad ever happens.<eos> Ashley. you are a great mom.<eos> the boys likhim better than me because he plays with them.
This-- this isn't a doubloon. This is somebody's something.<eos> Stealing from a pirate who already stole is still stealing.<eos> It's not once removed.<eos> Somebody didn't want that something if they buried it with somebody who can't use it.<eos> What if Lawrence Schatz was murdered for this buried treasure?<eos> Well, was gonna be before you got to him.<eos> Why'd you have to say it like that?<eos> There's a lot of hostility in these letters. Do you realize how angry someone has to be to put pen to paper?<eos> I mean, these people are furious.<eos> Any one of them could be the killer.
What,uh,was the nature of his work at lazar software?<eos> Whatever needed doing.<eos> He was there to learn.<eos> About?<eos> Oh,small business-- in my case,software-- inventory and billing systems.<eos> I could tell you more,but it usually clears dinner parties.<eos> If you could get us the personal information,we'll handle notifying the family.<eos> Thank you for coming in,mr. Lazar.<eos> So I just subpoenaed the personnel records of 250 bart employees.<eos> If any one of them so much as threatened a subway rat,I'll know about it.
Looks Likehe Was Saving For That For Months.<eos> Well, The Mexican Spa?<eos> It'S A Nice Place.<eos> There'S Maybe A Bit Of Hype About The Healing Powers Of Theatural Springs, But There'S Nothing Questionable.<eos> The Powder I Found In Reece'S Carpet Was Vermiculite-- It'S A Mineral Often Used In Insulation Or Fireproofing.<eos> There Were No Other Sources In Her Place.<eos> So It Could Have Come Off? Which Lends Credence To The Theory That She Was Murdered, And She Probably Knew Her Killer<eos> Because I Doubt That Dog Of Hers Would Have Let A Stranger In, Which Probably Leads Us Back To The Pacific Shores Retirement Community.<eos> On A Whim, I Pulled The Financial Records On The Residents From The Home Who Passed Away Over The Last Few Years.<eos> Several Of Them Left Portions Of Their Estate To A Nurse-- A Guy Named Logan Young.
The real war on marijuana didn't start until 1972, and President Nixon, he said it's all the Jews smoking pot.<eos> I mean, he really said that.<eos> When Nixon got into this with his War on Drugs, he had things that he wanted to do.<eos> He had an agenda.<eos> A lot of the information that was kept and warehoused in the Library of Congress and also at major universities, was actually recalled and destroyed...<eos> The Nixon report that came out through his administration was called the Shafer Report. It was by a Republican governor, and when he studied it and gave an ounce for it, "You can pick this report up, pick up any page, open it,<eos> "and if you actually have experience with cannabis, you'll realize they're telling the truth." And then when it came back saying that marijuana was essentially harmless, he totally ignored it, said, "We're going to launch a War on Drugs, anyways."<eos> They didn't even print as many copies that Congress and the House would have been able to see.<eos> 1970, beginning of the War on Drugs.<eos> 76 New Jersey troopers became detectives- - I was one of them.
If anythof interest pops up, why don't you text me?<eos> ROBBINS: All right.<eos> He needed a haircut.<eos> Are you lurking around here for results?<eos> No. No, no. I wouldn't do that.<eos> I was just, uh... I was getting a cup of coffee.<eos> Actually. You can come in.<eos> Why, do you got something?<eos> I do. I got a two-fer.<eos> I got epithelials from the rope from multiple contributors, and one of them... drank from the bloody beer bottle.
Yes, you do.<eos> I was at the window.<eos> Did you let him in?<eos> Yes.<eos> He's not a bad man.<eos> Do you want some coffee?<eos> It's a joke, really.<eos> Dan hardly saw the kids at all when we were married.<eos> He works in Manhattan. Life insurance.<eos> Now, all of a sudden, he can't live without them.
Elizabeth is dead,and amy is missing.<eos> That is tragic,but it has nothing to do with my client.<eos> Your fingerprints were found at the motel where the macalinos were murdered.<eos> My client has already explained that.<eos> Back before you were saving souls, when you were just molesting children,you had a partner... attorney:<eos> Who died in prison eight years ago.<eos> We found male dna on the bedsheets at the rancho center motel.<eos> You got yourself a new partner,just like old times.<eos> Only,this time,the parents busted in on you.<eos> That was bad for you,but worse for them.
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.<eos> Okay, it was nice meeting you.<eos> Nice meeting you.<eos> Good luck on your meeting.<eos> - Thank you. Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> So when do we get to smoke some of this allegedly extinct weed?<eos> When we get back to the house.<eos> - Why can't we just smoke some now?<eos> - 'Cause I promised my friends I wouldn't smoke it without them.
How is it there's a male Awakened Being?<eos> Don't Awakened Beings come from our final stages?<eos> In early times, there were both male and female warriors.<eos> Male?<eos> In early times, we created male warriors, as well.<eos> However, the male warriors were failures.<eos> No, I shouldn't call them failures.<eos> Male warriors were a success, actually.<eos> We had no complaints about their strength.<eos> The problem was male warriors surpassed their limits in a short amount of time since the awakening process brought them something akin to sexual pleasure.
I'm inclined to agree.<eos> You mind if i ask -- Why three husbands?<eos> You don't want to wait and read it in the article?<eos> It's because i love weddings, And i don't believe in divorce.<eos> See, stan loves me for my free spirit, And he's a great danr.<eos> And roger loves me for my cooking And for the way i keep our home.<eos> He's totally into me as a domestic goddess.<eos> And eddie -- Eddie just loves me for my body.<eos> But, uh, isn't that illegal?<eos> Actually, i never signed a marriage license With any of them.
Your what?<eos> Reno riamante is the love of my life.<eos> He's - - He's my soul mate.<eos> I would never marry him.<eos> I'm - - I'm confused.<eos> This man is deeply in love with you.<eos> How would you know?<eos> It's obvious from the picture.<eos> I think of my husbands as air bags.<eos> I need them to cushion the blow if reno and i ever crash.
Just a matter of time.<eos> Sandy Koufax is gonna die?<eos> Jesus Christ, that's terrible.<eos> Yeah, indeed, it is.<eos> My father, he's been a wreck for weeks.<eos> But hey, we gotta make a buck, right?<eos> Could you imagine being able to buy a Picasso a week before his demise?<eos> We can!<eos> Hmm. So you can pack the camera in the snow, have it pointing straight down the face of the cliff and then...<eos> Vinnie's beautiful mug pops out, just those big blue eyes with the bright, white snow surrounding them.
- You get what you want not what you need -<eos> - When you feel so tired but you can't sleep -<eos> I t was just a shock because I knew he was ill, very ill... but I didn't realize it was that bad.<eos> And I just-<eos> My son came up that night and he said...<eos> "What's the matter, Dad?<eos> You seem strange."<eos> I guess I was just moved by the fact that... this man that I was going to be doing a duet with... um, passed away.<eos> I always think that people who have been with the chorus are with us.<eos> You know, I think about the people who aren't here anymore... and I think that in some ways, we always think about them.
- It's time for breakfast.<eos> You're not hungry? or have a friend. Go away. So you're gonna die!<eos> because my brother has disappeared.<eos> - As your parents?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I was very sad when Bobby was gone.<eos> That was my dog.<eos> If it is your brother is with your parents on the secret island.<eos> You think?<eos> So I'm going with them.
Maybe you just inherited it.<eos> Like it's in your blood now, runs in the family.<eos> Well, it would make sense, juste one problem... Dr Jekyll and Dr Jackman are not related.<eos> Look at them, they must be.<eos> -But they're not, they can't be.<eos> -Why not?<eos> It's interesting that you have twins.<eos> Do they have similar personalities or are they opposites?<eos> They're very sweet, Dr Jackman.<eos> Don't you worry about them?
The elixir, that's gotta be promicin.<eos> And we know Collier's supposed to be the Messiah.<eos> And the father?<eos> I don't know.<eos> God, I guess?<eos> - But who are the chosen?<eos> - Flip the page.<eos> It's a list of names.<eos> Yeah. 200 in all.<eos> And most of them you'll recognize.
Everybody.<eos> He lied to you guys.<eos> - He did?<eos> - Greg wasn't doing a feature on the overburdened LAPD.<eos> He was about to expose how incompetent you are.<eos> Really?<eos> We're incompetent?<eos> Well, there are thousands of fugitives in LA who you guys say you can't catch.<eos> Greg did some basic research, followed up a few simple tips, and found a bunch of them.<eos> One of them crashed at those two addresses he gave you.
How much longer are we gonna have to clean up their mess?<eos> Matt, you're right.<eos> You're right.<eos> We've been used by these people, manipulated.<eos> But it's over.<eos> It stops here.<eos> No more secrets.<eos> So what do you wanna do?<eos> We take this all public.<eos> We expose them for what they are, what they've done, that they're the enemy.
You've got two popsicles.<eos> Welcome home.<eos> There is nothing you can do now.<eos> We lost.White Beard has won.<eos> We must go on while we still can.<eos> I can not.<eos> White Beard's army is preparing to march.<eos> But how? Even with your abillity,what can you do against an army...<eos> Destory their guns.<eos> Without them White Beard is nothing.
Forgot whose house he's in.<eos> If you hadn't fumbled the capture, I wouldn't have to...<eos> - Back it up!<eos> - Carlsson!<eos> Why don't you do everyone a favor and shut up.<eos> Captain Embry, Terry Deville.<eos> Don Lewis says you're a good man-- real police.<eos> I've certainly heard a lot about you, sir.<eos> Believe the good parts.<eos> I want to thank you for bringing my men back alive, even if you did have to shoot one of them.
THANKS.<eos> YOU THINK IT'S WONONDERFUL?<eos> MARRIAGES ARE FULL OF UPS AND DOWNS.<eos> I'VE HEARD THAT.<eos> HE'LL BRING HER FLOWERS.<eos> THEY'LL TAKE A WEEKEND TOGETHER.<eos> IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, HE CAN GET HER SOME JEWELRY.<eos> AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, ANNE WILL THROW HIM OUT AND WE'LL NEED TO GET A NEW TENANT, WHICH WOULD BE MY GUESS.<eos> WHY?<eos> WHY WOULD YOU GUESS IT'S ALL OVER BETWEEN THEM?
Now, we need your help.<eos> To save astronauts or to save your career?<eos> Why don't you answer that for me, Smith?<eos> What's worse for my career?<eos> My pet project blowing up in my face or me going to a psychic for help?<eos> Now, there are three men up there.<eos> Three fathers, three husbands, and three families.<eos> They're about to lose something a lot more important than a damn career.<eos> Now, you can think whatever you want about me.<eos> But you believe me when I tell you that I am thinking about them.
He's good with this kind of thing.<eos> Great!<eos> Thanks.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I was starting to worry if it was something to do with me.<eos> Well, that's where the smart money still is.<eos> Funny.<eos> Henry?<eos> You wanna run that by me one more time?<eos> People are disappearing into this crazy light, and nobody remembers them but me.
If I have done my work wisely and well, my story will have no final chapter.<eos> Father Garza has told me time and again that it's never too late to change.<eos> I say it's never too late to find a way to finish the work I started.<eos> Nobody saw or heard anything.<eos> But all this blood... yeah, and there's no sign of a body.<eos> You know, I really think he's dead.<eos> what do you think is going on?<eos> I think that Shepherd's family is more loyal than we ever thought, and they have a sick sense of irony.<eos> The D.A. got special permission to keep some trial mementos in his trophy case.<eos> One of them was the knife Shepherd used in '93.
Especially you...<eos> El Wray.<eos> I don't go by that name anymore.<eos> It's okay. It's okay.<eos> We're here in quarantine with the other survivors.<eos> Where is here?<eos> The old army base.<eos> El Wray?<eos> That you?<eos> He's with them.
That tip of yours said this lady's just an associate of Tyler's, right?<eos> Yeah, but we'd better play it safe.<eos> Knock on the door.<eos> I'm gonna head around back, make sure no one tries to flee the scene.<eos> Richard, a car just pulled up outside.<eos> Some people are coming.<eos> Isabelle, get down to the basement.<eos> If you hear any kind of struggle, run out the back, understand?<eos> Answer the door if they knock.<eos> See if you can get rid of them.
Jack had that stuffed imal the day he died?<eos> Police said they never found it.<eos> Maybe you will?<eos> It was his favorite toy when he was a little kid.<eos> He slept with it curled up in a little ball.<eos> He said it, uh, "kept the monsters away."<eos> I mean, not that he'd ever admit it.<eos> He was just a little boy, okay?<eos> He was the victim.<eos> Not them.
Wave a watch in front of her face and she'll stop what she's doing.<eos> Preliminary research indicates that something like that might be a possibility, but at this point, it's just a theory.<eos> I am sick and tired of theories.<eos> Right now we're under assault and Jane's leading the charge.<eos> But boss...<eos> We've seen her take hits to the body... but there's got to be a limit.<eos> We got enough firepower to the right area, there's got to be something that she can't heal from.<eos> Yeah, maybe, but the problem's access.<eos> She's got three unchipped neuroid freaks with her.<eos> Chances are won't leave home without them.
Even as a little kid.<eos> He was different.<eos> He wasn't quarrelsome, but he could be annoying.<eos> At 17. Lucio was looking for adventure.<eos> He wanted to leave Cascante so his brother took him to work in Valcarlos near the border with France.<eos> He was immediately involved in contraband possibly his first underground job.<eos> However, he had to give up contraband for the army.<eos> He started his military service in Logroño.<eos> Certain posts were more highly-valued than others.<eos> One of them was canteen duty.
No prints on the phone other than nakashima'S.<eos> Paper trail on the purchase of the cell leads to phony names and addresses.<eos> How does damion brock connect with lee nakashima?<eos> Or who did they both piss off?<eos> Let's focus on the victims,not the killer.<eos> Both these guys had a story to tell about something that hpeapned:<eos> Brock on the answering machine; nakashima on the cell phone.<eos> Something they saw-- and the killer wanted the truth.<eos> But after he got the truth,he killed them.<eos> Right,because he got what he wanted,he didn't need them any longer.
You would agree, wouldn't you, doctor?<eos> This is something of a problem.<eos> What're you doing? !<eos> Maybe now, you'll be inclined to tell us the truth!<eos> Unless, of course, you'd like to wait there while we retrieve our chip guns.<eos> You know, I can't seem to find mine.<eos> Do you know what's happened to yours?<eos> I'll tell you whatever you want.<eos> Just get them out of here.<eos> No, doctor, I think it best that they stayed and listened, after all, who'd better to call you on your lies than them.
-Please son.<eos> -Madam, we don't have time to waste with you.<eos> When is the commissioner suppose to go out?<eos> He didn't say.<eos> How can I help you, madam.<eos> It seems like it's you who is going to help me.<eos> Your face is charming and your eyes are full with kindness.<eos> The good people are obvious.<eos> At your service, Mother.<eos> My son is a good boy, but his friends told him to go to demonstrate with them.
I am the last technician before the exit level.<eos> I don't have much time left.<eos> We believed that the cycle was perfect. The energy, generated for the outside is reaching everywhere. And to everyone.<eos> The men digging underground made insensitive to the pain of their efforts recovered on the surface thanks to their own hardwork earning their place in this new society.<eos> The structure is different here!<eos> It will never hold!<eos> We knew what we wanted from the plant, we believed in it's generosity.<eos> But it's conditioning was not without risk.<eos> It's protecting itself from us.<eos> The workers of the depths went throught what's happening to me now. But I will not end up like them.
Dr. Morales will see us now.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Thank you, Sergeant.<eos> If the autopsy report reads accident...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Or suicide.<eos> Suicide would be great.<eos> - I'll be sure to let you know.<eos> - Don't make work for yourself.<eos> All right, y'all, let's start checking Mr. Henry's clients and their spouses, see if any of them have a criminal record.
Wonderful.<eos> Thank you, Sergeant.<eos> If the autopsy report reads accident...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Or suicide.<eos> Suicide would be great.<eos> - I'll be sure to let you know.<eos> - Don't make work for yourself.<eos> All right, y'all, let's start checking Mr. Henry's clients and their spouses, see if any of them have a criminal record.<eos> I want to know if any of them drive a black BMW.
Yeah.<eos> No, I'm coming.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, Chief, it turns out Henry's 23 active cases, he was either verbally or physically threatened by the opposing spouses in at least 11 of them.<eos> That we know of.<eos> Henry even pulled restraining orders on this guy, this lady here, him and him.<eos> And this one, this one right here.<eos> This one peed on his car.<eos> Lovely.<eos> Any of them drive black BMWs?
The position of planets in...<eos> How would it work?<eos> This is what you keep coming back to ask me.<eos> How could it possibly work?<eos> (How would that work? Yes)<eos> And I told you I don't know.<eos> It's a deep dark mystery.<eos> What isn't a deep dark mystery is why the trite vagaries of newspaper horoscopes seem to chime with readers.<eos> Psychologists have identified what's known as the 'Barnum Effect'.<eos> Whereby people tend to believe that statements are accurate for them personally.. while in fact they're general enough to apply to anyone.
Miyori!<eos> What's the rush?<eos> The dam people are here.<eos> Where?<eos> They're somewhere in the forest.<eos> Let everyone know!<eos> Okay!<eos> It's really happening.<eos> My forest really will...<eos> Is that them?
Could you be Miyori?<eos> The guardian of the forest?<eos> Yes, I am!<eos> Then I'll take you on a patrol!<eos> What a weakling.<eos> I can't help it.<eos> That was the first time I've flown.<eos> If I see golden eagles, I'll tell them to come here.<eos> You will? !<eos> But it's up to them to decide whether or not they'll live here.
Call our telecom team.<eos> I have a new idea product idea.<eos> ASAP.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Sir.<eos> And what else I am afraid of?<eos> Stake owners.<eos> I want a meeting with the stake owners tomorrow morning.<eos> I just want to see the expression on their faces.. when they realise that mom is back.<eos> After that I will place my terms with them.
Somebody recently described what they call prostitution where a female, who is out collecting rocks for her nest, and, of course, some penguins are...<eos> The only way they collect rocks is to steal them from others. So, in order to do that, they have to be very submissive in order to get close to a male, who's maybe advertising for a mate, and so she'll come in, sit in his nest, and sometimes they'll copulate.<eos> But, really, her idea is to get a rock, and so, as soon as she can, she escapes with a rock.<eos> Dr. Ainley, is there such thing as insanity among penguins?<eos> I try to avoid the definition of insanity or derangement.<eos> I don't mean that a penguin might believe he or she is Lenin or Napoleon Bonaparte, but could they just go crazy because they've had enough of their colony?<eos> Well, I've never seen a penguin bashing its head against a rock.<eos> They do get disoriented. They end up in places they shouldn't be, a long way from the ocean.<eos> These penguins are all heading to the open water to the right.<eos> But one of them caught our eye, the one in the center.
Very telling.<eos> - Uh, may I hear that again? - Sure. "No innocent... "<eos> This is gonna be a good month, the month of my great escape.<eos> That's good, and cut!<eos> It's a singular chance, this month.<eos> Who gets to vivisect his own childhood?<eos> The first full scene up is the straightening of the hall runner, something we did every exasperating day of my childhood.<eos> An unbelievable source of frustration for everyone, for the rug could actually never be straightened out, no matter how much anyone pulled from either end.<eos> And mother always nagged from the sidelines.<eos> The actors put in a limp performance, displaying little affect, and it's me behind the camera who gets frustrated instead of them.
But if Steve was involved with the use of that weapon, then he crossed the line.<eos> Of course, we'll never know now.<eos> Lieutenant, off the record, you're looking at us when you should be looking outside.<eos> So you're saying steve had enemies.<eos> Plenty.<eos> I'm gonna need those names.<eos> I'm sorry, but those files are confidential.<eos> You'll just have to find them on your own.<eos> Yes, and I will.<eos> And a word to the wise, Mr. Butler, your name better not be amongst them.
What about a recent rejection?<eos> Something set him off.<eos> Any of these guys get fired recently,or did their wife leave?<eos> I'm sorry,em. Thats ifar too general,even for my powers of snooping.<eos> Ok. Ok.<eos> you're a security guard.<eos> I'm not sure I like where this is going.<eos> - You probably had higher ambitions.<eos> - Easy.<eos> Could you cross-check these guys against police and military records? See if any of them got kicked out or rejected.
You dupe these guys into coming down here, then you ambush them?<eos> Nothing Logan said in there is admissible.<eos> I don't think that's really for you to decide now, is it?<eos> My client has a movie opening in three weeks.<eos> If you ruin his reputation by dragging him into some sloppy murder investigation, you could cost a lot of people a lot of money.<eos> Let me tell you something. I don't care about that, okay? I don't care one iota about that.<eos> What I care about is the dead girl in your client's house.<eos> Now, if any of them had anything to do with it, I'm gonna be coming after 'em, okay?<eos> Then do it when you have an arrest warrant, Agent Eppes.<eos> Until then, stay the hell away from them.
She just never knew why.<eos> When you gotta take out your own agents. It's pretty deep cover.<eos> It's like playing wonder ball, You're the one who holds it last and for you the game is past.<eos> She's a good agent.<eos> Any guess on where there bodies came from ?<eos> Well, hundred miles from El Salvador, a hundred miles from Nicaragua, but a string of islands in between.<eos> God knows where they could have come from.<eos> God ain't Uncle Sam.<eos> Question is:<eos> What are we gonna do about them know ?
- They never do.<eos> You want every inch of surveillance footage?<eos> Yes, because I need to examine it frame by frame to see if there's anything in the background you guys missed.<eos> I also need a joystick controller, video transmitters, a coax cable, and a programmable park.<eos> And I don't mean that hypothetically.<eos> Mrs. Jacobs' cell phone had Katie's picture on it.<eos> Mall Security helped us make copies.<eos> Okay, we need to get one of these to every search team, every officer, every patron.<eos> Potential witnesses need to know who we're looking for, too.<eos> The problem is our unsub could be any one of them.
Are you gonna drag me out of this movie with five minutes to go?<eos> That's insane. It's not five minutes.<eos> This is the world's worst film I've ever seen and I really want to go.<eos> Come on, five more minutes.<eos> What do you gain by staying?<eos> You don't care about this story.<eos> I finish things I start.<eos> Books-- they could be 500 pages, once I start them, even if I hate it, I'll finish it.<eos> I have friends who I can't stand, you know, for, like, 25 years.<eos> I'm still friends with them.
The need of the hour as we see it is three major components:<eos> shelter, sanitation and clean water.<eos> April 2005 Mike and 7 crew members respond to an urgent call for help from the tsunami hit Andaman Islands.<eos> Bay of Bengal, India<eos> You see it as you approach it from the boat, the tree line where the wave crashed through.<eos> You just see everything crushed and washed away, and devastation everywhere, and it´s...<eos> It was brutal.<eos> How could it be much worse?<eos> An 8.9 earthquake followed by a 30 foot wave,<eos> 3/4 of the people are gone and half of them are dead.
So?<eos> I know these people better than anyone, And none of them fits the description Of the man you've described.<eos> One of them does.<eos> I'm sorry. I--I- - I--<eos> He's a mimic.<eos> He imitates faith, Attends service every sunday, But only goes because everyone else goes.<eos> You know him.<eos> I do my best to guide my congregation, ok? But these days, most of them--<eos> Not just the younger, unmarried men-- Are imitating faith.<eos> Almost all of them come because the rest of them do.
Doing great.<eos> - Great to see you, too.<eos> - Great to see you again.<eos> - All right, guys.<eos> Guys, there'll be time to elect him pope over the weekend, ok, but come to the party, if you can.<eos> Let's get out of here.Let's take him home.<eos> - See you.<eos> - Bye.Take it easy.<eos> Man, I'm sorry to tear you away from your friends.<eos> Were you worrying them, too?
Yeah, I do.<eos> Look, I was fresh out of medical school and hell-bent on making a difference.<eos> Then it would seem like the kind of thing you'd notice.<eos> You're trained not to.<eos> Just get them in and out as quickly as possible.<eos> - And I'd been warned.<eos> - About what?<eos> They told us these kids would do anything for attention.<eos> So you thought they were faking it?<eos> No one wanted them and they knew it.
Must've been standing there an awfully long time.<eos> A few days.<eos> Days?<eos> He says when one of us does something bad, we all got to pay the price.<eos> Send the next kid in, all right?<eos> Don't forget to give that prescription to your counselor.<eos> So Grimes was the counselor to all the boys with those injuries?<eos> Yes, night counselor.<eos> Former resident, too.<eos> A lot of them came back to work there.
Are you sure?<eos> Ok,that's a ervin robles.<eos> Last known is 39 hill street.<eos> That's downtown.<eos> Employed by the denver city pound.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Your parents would be really proud of you.<eos> It's too late to be a good daughter now.<eos> Oh,that's not true.<eos> I was horrible to them. And now they're gone.
OK.<eos> Hey Hey. That is beautiful. It is.<eos> Beautiful to see my parents in love.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Oh. There's left over quiche in the fridge.<eos> Yeah. My stomach's off, suddenly.<eos> I've seen movies. That is a spy truck, if I ever see one.<eos> It says "candy".<eos> Huh huh. It's full of microphones, and men drinking coffee from paper cups.<eos> One of them is the sarge.
I am just asking you to give them some peace.<eos> It's up to the ghost, not me.<eos> Fine.<eos> You're gonna do what you're gonna do.<eos> I just sometimes don't understand her.<eos> I mean, what's it gonna take, you know?<eos> After all she's seen, she can't just say,<eos> "Ok, I get it.<eos> There's ghosts. "<eos> Well, sometimes what people don't believe Is just as important to them as what they do believe, And some people feel better
These are the two that were stealing.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I know you.<eos> And you.<eos> You're the guys who own that dive bar down the street.<eos> You're the corporate dude with the helicopter.<eos> Right. Here's the thing.<eos> I had a really strange night last night.<eos> Your friends and their doowop group... they showed up at my house and attacked me.<eos> One of them died on my doorstep, and it sort of put me in a funk.
You find something, Messer?<eos> Hey, zoom in on the right corner for a second.<eos> You see that?<eos> You tipping me for my zooming skills?<eos> The Treasury Department started embedding blue and red fibers into currency to prevent counterfeiting.<eos> Yeah, the fibers are consistent.<eos> At some point, they probably realized that all the stolen cash couldn't fit in the box, so they dumped it out to find a bigger one.<eos> In the process, one of the bills must've ripped and got caught on the edge.<eos> So these guys are mailing the money somewhere.<eos> It's a smart move, not keeping cash on them or in the apartment.
No, come on, think.<eos> Anything. Go back.<eos> The seat belt was buckled behind his back.<eos> Why does that matter?<eos> It wasn't a rental.<eos> It was for surveillance.<eos> Agents don't wear seat belts. They need to get out in a hurry.<eos> All right, let's cut the crap.<eos> You need to be straight with us. Right now.<eos> Look at me, not them.
I've ordered the kidnapping and attempted murder of 4 foreign spies including a key man at the CIA.<eos> And all this to source a vaccin the government may already have secured without deigning to tell its own security services<eos> Say nothing.<eos> Between the devil and the deep blue sea.<eos> So, what will you do?<eos> I can't risk my officers on Kuznetzov uncorroborative word.<eos> I have nothing up my sleeve.<eos> You won't let them hear that?<eos> I don't care how you feel.<eos> To them, you're Harry Pearce, the steel point to the turning world and you won't let them see you like this.
'Well, then, you be careful.'<eos> Moments after the cargo plane disappeared, another pilot reported taking evasive action to avoid an unidentified object that didn't appear on radar.<eos> But there are no other reports of another plane missing or damaged?<eos> Not yet. A cargo plane downed and three crew-men dead.<eos> Not a very impressive tally for a terror target.<eos> Is it conceivable that a UK plane is shot down deliberately to crash into a US base?<eos> Well, access to the perimeter of Halesworth is relatively easy.<eos> The base is home to a permanent encampment of UFO freaks.<eos> Our very own Area 51.<eos> The possibility of infiltration is why we're keeping an eye on them.
yeah, we're here.<eos> they got it.<eos> they found the mouse.<eos> postman's deaf.<eos> the head man?<eos> no sign.<eos> you think of a way the postman walks out of here alive?<eos> no. head man doesn't show, we blow the whole popsicle stand.<eos> i've got our friend, the interrogator, and... a couple fellows i don't recognize.<eos> one of them could be the head man. not sure.
Come on, Nick.<eos> Life's messy.<eos> Why didn't you tell me that Elder's parents worked for the family?<eos> The whole point of this was for him to trust me.<eos> I didn't want to put you in a position where you would have to lie.<eos> And I could not take a chance that his faith in you would be in any way diminished.<eos> So all that was true about Elder's parents?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I mean, he got it wrong about my parents reporting his parents to the authorities.<eos> That wasn't them.
Well,I'm gonna help you anyway.<eos> I'll talk to her.<eos> - Thanks,denise.<eos> - Don't bother.<eos> This is rivero.<eos> I heard the "be on the lookout" for nivaldo on my police scanner, so I started thinkin'-- where do illegal immigrants go when they're on the run from the police?<eos> Sanctuary churches. The unis are on it.<eos> But unis,as in guys in uniform, as in not the folks that these folks are gonna talk to.<eos> Granted,they don't really talk to reporters either, which is why it's lucky I have cultivated some contacts in the mission district.<eos> One of them told me about rivero.
Sniper.<eos> you hold on. you hold on, you hear me?<eos> You being here without an M.P.Could get you fired.<eos> 1, 2, 3, 4, hey, hey!<eos> 1, 2, 3, 4, hey, hey!<eos> We're doin' double time to get more pay!<eos> Doin' double time to get more pay!<eos> Quicktime!<eos> March!<eos> Maybe tell your homeboys I want to do business with them.
Sue me for sexual harassment.<eos> Come on, man, we're done here.<eos> You know, I have been on this gang for over 13 months now.<eos> Look, we'll get their weapons stash.<eos> You'll have your evidence.<eos> Just give me 24 hours and I'll keep my men on a tight leash.<eos> Thank you for stepping in.<eos> Well, it wasn't right.<eos> I understand.<eos> Look, it wasn't my choice to work with them.
How you feeling?<eos> Like I been shot in the chest.<eos> The room's empty.<eos> The stash was never here.<eos> Well, then they must have moved it.<eos> You need to chase them off base in order to find this binary, and so you used the chick c.i.d. Agent. Nice.<eos> - We needed more time.<eos> - And as a result,<eos> I got no evidence, my suspects are out in the wind<eos> Our man is with them.
Three hundred!<eos> Yes, yes, yes, it's me!<eos> Julia's ready, we moved to Trauma 2.<eos> Water is the source of all life.<eos> It's used in healing rituals all over the world in almost every faith.<eos> Water is an element of cleansing and purification.<eos> Today, we use sterile saline. It's what we work with.<eos> And water doesn't get much cleaner than that.<eos> Earlier, we talked about what our patients do for us. How they affect us. Stay with us.<eos> Now we'll honor what we do for them. And pay thanks for the abilities we've been given hoping that we may continue to use them to serve our community.
Bingo! Wow.<eos> Goodness gracious with this guy.<eos> If it's not one thing, it's another thing.<eos> Oh, okay. But think about it this way. If we split it, it's only a few hundred dollars each.<eos> Great, yeah. Let me just go grab my cash from my money tree... that I have planted.<eos> I know a leprechaun who has a pot of gold.<eos> He lives at the end of my street.<eos> Maybe I'll go to a bank and say, "Hello.<eos> Do I have an account here?" Call Donald Trump!<eos> How do three men in their 30s not have $800 between them?
- I don't know!<eos> Listen, Billy was a brave soldier.<eos> They all were the 442nd.<eos> Mmh... Billy didn't seem like your average gung-ho soldier.<eos> He didn't want to enlist. And that broke Ray's heart.<eos> And that's the reason Ray asked me to come visit.<eos> I just can't wait to get overseas and let those Nazis have it.<eos> Your parents must be so proud.<eos> Your dad says you're not joining up.<eos> No matter what we do, we'll always be Japs to them.
This club is a mess.<eos> It looks terrible.<eos> Tons of guns trying to kiss.<eos> How horrible!<eos> You were lucky, JD?<eos> I talked with some guys.<eos> I would not be fit yesterday.<eos> I should cut my hair?<eos> They were all short.<eos> Do not do it for them, you do not want.
- The handsome, Des met!<eos> - That's me.<eos> He's cute ...<eos> You should go out with him.<eos> - He has good taste.<eos> - Really?<eos> Advance.<eos> It's nice to lending me your DVDs.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> - Why do you play with them?
So you recognised Santee?<eos> Yeah, Steffen Cavani.<eos> Stoner we went to high school with.<eos> Come on, she's totally with them.<eos> MEGAN: Yes and no.<eos> - Well, how no?<eos> She's young and she's vulnerable, and she hasn't had any contact with anyone outside of her captors.<eos> What, like brainwashing?<eos> She would not be first to identify with her victimizers then act accordingly.<eos> She's with them a day and a half.
Not at the same time.<eos> So, when there's a problem, how are you summoned?<eos> I'm making a deal with the Commissioner to light up the sky with a spotlight of my symbol.<eos> - What's your symbol?<eos> - A big nose in the sky.<eos> Trouble is, sometimes it doesn't exactly look like a nose.<eos> It's not a cupcake, either.<eos> Da da- da daa!<eos> Are you friends with other superheroes?<eos> - Some of them.
We are now a nuclear power.<eos> Ros?<eos> Harry's told Bakhshi.<eos> We've agreed to let him prepare his own cover story.<eos> Fine.<eos> Ros, I should never have put you in that position, or Ana.<eos> We all cross boundaries.<eos> It goes with the territory.<eos> I probably said a lot of strange things last night.<eos> But if one of them was 'thanks', I meant it.
Don't do this.<eos> Lie down.<eos> Lie down first.<eos> I know my own body condition.<eos> I don't want to stay in the hospital.<eos> Listen.<eos> I will take you home when you get better.<eos> That means I can't leave then.<eos> Your situation is much better than other patients who are at the same stage.<eos> Many of them can't even stand the proliferation.
I worked steadily and saved up some money. When I went back home...<eos> I discovered that my parents weren't there anymore.<eos> They had died shortly after I went off to Bangkok.<eos> What happened?<eos> They say it was an accident.<eos> I don't even know what kind of accident, and I don't want to know.<eos> I just know that they're gone.<eos> I did everything that I did to make them happy.<eos> The entire time I didn't know they were already dead.<eos> I didn't have a chance to make anything better for them... to apologize... or to even let them know just how much I loved them.
You may pay in cash, naturally.<eos> Do you reckon I can just go out, and pick up money off the pavement?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> May I see the note that is in question?<eos> I am a shareholder of that bank.<eos> Is this note a forgery?<eos> No. But by the end of the week it'll be worthless.<eos> Town and County's in trouble, and looks probable to fail.<eos> I will give you five good sovereigns for that note, Jem Hearne.<eos> If the bank is to fail, I cannot have it on my conscience that good, honest people will lose an amount that means so much to them!
you must be robin.<eos> curt "the iron man" irons.<eos> i'm gonna be doing sports.<eos> oh. welcome.<eos> you look really familiar. are you a former athlete?<eos> hockey.<eos> the attraction is instant and undeniable.<eos> but you know better.<eos> you've seen your friends make the same mistakes before.<eos> you've laughed smugly at them.
remember what happened with me and marshall?<eos> the gerards across the hall?<eos> michael and laura.<eos> they're awesome!<eos> we're gonna invite them over for dinner.<eos> -no! no! really?<eos> -are you insane? guys, guys, guys, this is new york city.<eos> you don't get close to the neighbors.<eos> you nod at them politely in the hall.<eos> you call the cops if you haven't seen them in a while and you smell something funny, and that is it.

Oh I have been smiling lately,<eos> Dreaming about the world as one.<eos> And I believe it could be,<eos> Some day it's going to come.<eos> Cause out on the edge of darkness,<eos> There rides a peace train.<eos> Oh peace train take this country,<eos> Come take me home again.<eos> A kind, forgiving, charitable season.<eos> The only time in the long calender of the year. When men and women seem by one consent, to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow passengers to the grave.
I give up! I give up!<eos> On ground, now!<eos> Freeze!<eos> Don't even think about it.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You found your dog?<eos> Hey,what's going to happen to all these dogs now?<eos> They'll have to be put down.<eos> Law says they're dangerous.<eos> And the people who turn them into killers, They just get away with a slap on the wrist,huh?
It supports blind submission to authority.<eos> It reduces human responsibility to the effect that "God" controls everything, and in turn awful crimes can be justified in the name of Divine Pursuit.<eos> And most importantly, it empowers those who know the truth but use the myth to manipulate and control societies.<eos> The religious myth is the most powerful device ever created, and serves as the psychological soil upon which other myths can flourish.<eos> A myth is an idea that, while widely believed, is false.<eos> In a deeper sense, in the religious sense, a myth serves as an orienting and mobilizing story for people.<eos> The focus is not on the story's relation to reality but on its function.<eos> A story cannot function, unless it is believed to be true in the community or the nation.<eos> It is not a matter of debate if some people have the bad taste to raise the question of the truth of the sacred story.<eos> The keepers of the faith do not enter into the debate with them.
But a lot of artists like that... become extraordinary, powerful... because they are not what they would like to be.<eos> Uh, so everything is like a creation.<eos> I'm going to remake what God didn't make me.<eos> But if you're thinking about a nice, cozy, warm fire... and conveys that meaning of family... this is a fire that's restrained.<eos> I suspect that John Ford respected fire, and a warm fire, in its place... but you get too close and you find out more about the fire than you want-you get burned.<eos> Uh, he was a tyrant.<eos> He was a sadist.<eos> The John Ford family is like a bunch of abused children and an abusive father.<eos> Yet they were devoted to him.<eos> That's kind of the way, unfortunately... people are sometimes toward people who are mean to them.
Our Earth formed in the right bit of space.<eos> We've got the right kind of sun and a moon that gives us stability.<eos> An environment that remains relatively stable is essential for complex life to survive.<eos> But there's a curious twist.<eos> Too much stability and evolution can get stuck in a bit of a rut.<eos> Every now and then life needs a catastrophe to shake things up.<eos> In the jungles of Mexico lies the evidence of one such catastrophe, one that turned out to be very important for us humans.<eos> You know, everywhere you go around here, you find these holes.<eos> They're called cenotes.<eos> There's thousands of them, and most of them haven't even been explored.
Look at that one stinging me right now.<eos> Look at that. It's an encouraging find.<eos> The fact that this part of the forest is teeming with insect life means that here, at least, it's still pretty healthy.<eos> And by convention, whoever discovers a new species gets to give it a name.<eos> In a very generous gesture, Brian chose to name the new ant after me.<eos> Say hello to Cerapachys iainstewarti.<eos> Bit of a mean-looking critter if you ask me.<eos> The more we find out about these forests, the more we're discovering how vital they are to the well-being of the whole planet.<eos> The jungle is a wonderful place.<eos> You can really get a sense of how the trees are part of an intricate web and how the other plants and animals depend on them. And that's not only true for Madagascar.
of course, deforestation is not a problem that's confined to Madagascar.<eos> In Bolivia, this area of rainforest covering 50,000 square kilometres was turned into farmland and towns in just 20 years.<eos> Each year across the planet, an area of forest about the size of Scotland is destroyed.<eos> So not only are we increasing the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, we're also reducing the ability of the planet to deal with the problem.<eos> It's just one example of the way that humans are disrupting systems that have taken millions of years to build up.<eos> In this series I've already witnessed some of the changes this is causing.<eos> As temperatures rise, glaciers and ice sheets are shrinking.<eos> The result will be sea level rise which may threaten many of our cities.<eos> In the oceans, rising carbon dioxide levels are beginning to acidify sea water.<eos> Ultimately, this is expected to damage coral reefs and, with them, the complex food chain they support.
What do you mean, we never "actually" met?<eos> It's an experiment of some sort.<eos> Like chess.<eos> So I'm like a... a chess piece?<eos> There's a black Kate and a white Kate?<eos> Who's playing this game?<eos> People.<eos> Like them?<eos> Well, that would be exciting, wouldn't it?<eos> So you're... you're one of them?
Outside of Spain, this is the largest collection of Coellos in the world.<eos> You were followed on your way to the museum.<eos> Who are they?<eos> The Allamvédelmi Hatosag, what the Hungarians call the AVH.<eos> AVH secret police.<eos> You're not Hungarian?<eos> No, I'm English.<eos> My husband was Hungarian.<eos> I saw the AVH men through my office window, a car and at least three people on foot.<eos> It must be standard procedure for them to keep tabs on foreigners.
Really?<eos> Really?<eos> Please".<eos> This is "Millennium".<eos> This happened over 50 years ago.<eos> During World war II.<eos> a large number of Nazi officers began to flee the country.<eos> Many new German organizations began to form.<eos> The purpose of them was to help the Nazi war criminals escape.<eos> Most of them fled to different parts of South America.
Anyway, Charley gone, and all of his brothers, who's minding' the zoo?<eos> Homer?<eos> 1968.<eos> America watched its war plan collapse, its cities burn, its youth erupt, its president crumble, its greatest leaders fall slain.<eos> And there we were. All alone with Richard Nixon.<eos> No. No. Not at all.<eos> Come on, face it.<eos> Face it, it's over. All these groups promoting the movement are so full of their own president, vice president, - and secretary bullshit.<eos> - Not at all.<eos> They just think it's all about them, man.
Can you make this?<eos> - Yeah<eos> Spread out!<eos> ...<eos> What time is it?<eos> Quarter past three<eos> Where is the 3:10 to Yuma?<eos> Running late, I suppose<eos> How late? Beats me It gets here when it gets here<eos> God damned trains, You never can rely on them, huh?
- I am listening to you. Not these insurance of existing and...<eos> I have made many things in my life and maybe I have not made the necessary thing. And if I make this maybe I will make it.<eos> - To exist?<eos> These trembling, he/she eats something.<eos> - Lee the book.<eos> - This is stupid.<eos> Please.<eos> Well I will read it if you eat something.<eos> This is for you.<eos> The parents have one advantage on us. We want to believe in them.

Please, hear my warning.<eos> Because the day you hunt outside your pack, you are dead to it.<eos> I got it. I got it.<eos> How's an American girl end up in Romania anyhow?<eos> I was born here in a community of expatriates from all over.<eos> And my parents moved to the States when I was little, and then I moved back.<eos> Without your parents?<eos> They died in the States when I was little.<eos> I've lived with my aunt ever since.<eos> -Do you remember them?
- What do you mean?<eos> - Well, you like to make things up.<eos> And that's what your parents do for a living.<eos> You know a lot about hardware?<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, your dad works at a hardware store.<eos> OK.<eos> All I'm saying is that you are who you are not your parents.<eos> If they work at your house, you must get to hang out with them a lot.
I got you, Leslie!<eos> I got you!<eos> Up ahead!<eos> Get ready!<eos> - They'll catch us.<eos> - We're the fastest in Terabithia.<eos> He's watching us.<eos> Where are the keys?<eos> Here, open this.<eos> Where are Terabithian warriors when you need them?
You set me up, you crazy son of a...<eos> Wow.<eos> That is disgusting.<eos> If that comes out your front, I don't even want to know what's coming out the back.<eos> Don't look down, Congressman, but the wolves are here, although I wouldn't worry so much about these wolves as those.<eos> Gesundheit.<eos> As you can see behind me, New York Noah's prediction came true.<eos> The vote of the Land Act Bill has been suspended, pending investigation of Congressman Long for profiteering...<eos> Of course now, the question is, how will these animals be returned to their natural habitats?<eos> Something tells me, if God got them here, he can probably get them home.
Yeah.<eos> Great.<eos> Get some sleep.<eos> -l think he's gonna be fine.<eos> -l think so.<eos> -And you guys seem great.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> You have lovely friends.<eos> My best friends.<eos> I'd give my life for them.
If I want to, I could rip your rotten liver out.<eos> Try it!<eos> My liver has a new master now.<eos> I can't give them back to you brother.<eos> Mongols chose for themselves.<eos> Keep an eye on your horse.<eos> I'll come to take it back.<eos> Daritai, they're taking our horses!<eos> Jamuhas' men tried to take away your herd.<eos> One of them was killed.
We can't just leave him to die and become some human experiment!<eos> He'll die in vain if we don't accomplish our mission.<eos> Bumblebee is a brave soldier.<eos> This is what he would want.<eos> Why are we fighting to save the humans?<eos> They're a primitive and violent race.<eos> Were we so different?<eos> They're a young species.<eos> They have much to learn.<eos> But I've seen goodness in them.
- Move to cover!<eos> Watch out!<eos> - Girl, get that tow truck out of here! - I'm going!<eos> I'm going!<eos> Get out of here now!<eos> Megatron!<eos> Prime.<eos> Humans don't deserve to live.<eos> They deserve to choose for themselves.<eos> Then you will die with them!
So I guess Amir has no friends.<eos> We're not bothering you.<eos> Wrong.<eos> You are bothering me.<eos> Afghanistan is the land of the Pashtuns.<eos> We're the real Afghans.<eos> Not this flat-nose Hazara.<eos> His people pollute our homeland.<eos> They dirty our blood.<eos> If idiots like you and your father didn't take these people in, we'd be rid of them.
Uh, Mr Curtis?<eos> What?<eos> Sorry, sir.<eos> Who have we got today, then?<eos> Mrs Brady.<eos> - We done her before?<eos> - Don't think so.<eos> Let's hope she's got a sympathetic doctor.<eos> I mean, I like me neighbours, don't get me wrong.<eos> Mind you, the stink of some of them.
Richard, we made plans for this months ago.<eos> Why did you wait till now to tell me you can't go?<eos> - I just forgot all about it.<eos> I'm sorry. - So tell them that.<eos> It's an important conference, I'm the speaker.<eos> I can't just not show up, people count on me.<eos> And I don't?<eos> They're strangers at a convention, an audience.<eos> They applaud, you eat it up.<eos> So I have to wonder, are you doing this for them or for you?
At that point, Alpha and Bravo will swarm the entrance...<eos> If you could just be quiet and do exactly what I say, I'll save your life.<eos> We need to stop the vehicle here before they get through the gates.<eos> Alpha and Bravo will hold and contain here.<eos> Sniper teams will initiate on Johnsors call.<eos> On his call.<eos> Are we clear?<eos> All elements shoot to kill any hostiles.<eos> What about intel?<eos> We don't need them.
How do you wanna play it?<eos> Big choppers here?<eos> No.<eos> Just yours.<eos> They took the setup crew back to the mainland.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll collect my things.<eos> You meet me at the chopper in 10 minutes.<eos> And the crew?<eos> If the military's coming, they're coming for me, not them.
Come on.<eos> I didn't know you had a baby.<eos> Oh, is that okay?<eos> The more the merrier.<eos> You shouldn't smoke.<eos> It's a bad habit.<eos> - I think we just passed a filling station.<eos> - It was closed.<eos> Do you always go around helping people in the night?<eos> When I'm done with them, they don't need much help.
I have been for 27 years.<eos> I'm completely worn out.<eos> Year after year, listening to patients who aren't satisfied with their lives, who want to have fun, who want me to help them with that.<eos> It wears you out, I can tell you.<eos> My life isn't exactly a lot of fun either.<eos> People demand so much.<eos> That's the conclusion I've drawn after all these years.<eos> They demand to be happy, at the same time as they are egocentric, selfish, and ungenerous.<eos> Well, I would like to be honest.<eos> I would like to say that they are quite simply mean, most of them.
And those good vibrations seem to have spread all the way through this arena.<eos> What, what!<eos> You guys are up.<eos> And now the moment this crowd has been waiting for.<eos> And how is this going to work?<eos> Completely different skaters, known to be enemies of one another, combining to be the first male-male pair team in the history of the sport.<eos> Either the locked-in technical style of MacElroy will not mesh with Michaels' improvisations or they create great music together and reinvent the sport in their own image.<eos> They're laughing at us.<eos> They laughed at Louis Armstrong when he said he was gonna go to the moon.<eos> Now he's up there laughing at them.
Good fucking job! Well done.<eos> I'm so happy to see you. You have no idea I'm so sorry.<eos> I can't even imagine what you're going through.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> You can call us anytime if you need anything.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I know I can always count on you guys.<eos> I mean... thanks.<eos> I can't do this alone. Sam's friends just came over here to smoke pot with her on the porch.<eos> And if she was there, she would have been smoking pot with them, too.
Perhaps Hendrickje can be an angel?<eos> - Are you pregnant, Hendrickje? - Angels should be innocent.<eos> - What, even in the 17th century?<eos> - But I-I-I am innocent.<eos> - Painting soldiers will make me blind.<eos> Blind and fingerless.<eos> Both my father and my brother had their fingers blown off by the Dutch artillery - and not by being shot at, but by shooting at!<eos> - Rembrandt.<eos> - And painting repetitious rows of smiling part-time soldiers is boring and certainly bad for the eyes.<eos> Not one of them's ever fired a musket in anger, though all of them claim to have pulled the King of Spain's fucking beard!
They should be in the care of Davy Jones.<eos> That was the duty him was charged with by the goddess Calypso.<eos> To ferry those who die at sea to the other side.<eos> And every ten years, him could come ashore to be with she who love him. Truly.<eos> But the man has become a monster.<eos> So he wasn't always tentacle-y?<eos> Him was a man. Once.<eos> Now there's boats coming.<eos> They're not a threat to us. Am I right?<eos> We are nothing but ghosts to them.
Damn it. Damn it!<eos> Hey, Glenn.<eos> Sorry, we've all been sick, I've been sleeping on the couch.<eos> Oh, yeah? Camping out?<eos> Tara!<eos> Your daddy's here!<eos> - Are you feeling better?<eos> I would have brought some chicken soup.<eos> - How are your folks?<eos> - Oh, you know sick of me staying with them.
Four turtles four brothers genetically reborn in the sewers of New York.<eos> Named after the great Renaissance masters and trained as ninjas.<eos> They battled many creatures and foes before defeating their archenemy the Shredder.<eos> But now a greater evil is poised to destroy their very brotherhood.<eos> An evil born 3000 years ago.<eos> It was in that time that a warrior king named Yoatl led a brotherhood that fought side by side with one purpose:<eos> To conquer all the kingdoms of the world.<eos> Nothing could stand in their way as they left a trail of destruction behind them.
Don't move.<eos> Shut down the machine!<eos> Don't harm her.<eos> Shut down!<eos> Turned on.<eos> Picture transmission.<eos> Sound transmission.<eos> Get out.<eos> Get the trucks ready.<eos> I will take care of them.
Why is that?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Some riddles aren't worth solving.<eos> You are here.<eos> I thought it a nightmare.<eos> Where is Farmer?<eos> Where is Zeph?<eos> Bastian, where is Zeph?<eos> Is he with our parents?<eos> Yes. He's with them, but... he didn't make it.

He's with them, but... he didn't make it.<eos> He... was killed with them the day you were taken.
They're gonna want that bust for themselves, right?<eos> - You're serious?<eos> - Yeah, it happens all the time.<eos> - Parallel investigations.<eos> - I questioned him up close, okay?<eos> There's no way this guy is faking.<eos> Maybe he played you.<eos> Or he is hurt... did lose his memory, but he's running on instinct.<eos> What better cover to infiltrate your company than a janitor?<eos> Janitors go anywhere, everywhere, nobody pays any attention to them.
And there she was.<eos> Smiling. Calm.<eos> It was her way of telling me:<eos> "I'm fine, I'm safe, don't suffer for me."<eos> It is not unusual to feel, in some way, the presence of a loved one after their death.<eos> All of us in this group could tell you similar stories.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> My son is not dead.<eos> His friends took him.<eos> I saw one of them.
Actually I'm pregnant right now.<eos> That's wonderful.<eos> Congratulations!<eos> Thank you.<eos> You have to admit this would make a perfect nursery.<eos> With this much land so close to the city, I'm sure it's out of our price range. Isn't it?<eos> Actually the owners are anxious to get the place off their hands as soon as possible.<eos> Really?<eos> Their daughter went off to college, so they decided to move into the city.<eos> I guess they felt like this was too much house for the two of them.
Nice attack, doo-doo heads.<eos> Too bad we have one last trick up our sleeve.<eos> I doubt that.<eos> Remember this, Farnsworth?<eos> Farnsworth?<eos> That's me!<eos> My doomsday device!<eos> So it was the scammers!<eos> They sawed off my hand and stole the doomsday device.<eos> It wasn't them.
I love waking up and having something to look forward to.<eos> Something fun and sneaky and sexy.<eos> He love you?<eos> He kind of likes me.<eos> He kind of hates me.<eos> It's fun.<eos> It doesn't sound very fun.<eos> He makes me forget about my invalid husband, my loneliness, the dreadful misplacement of my bosoms.<eos> Becky, I don't know how to tell you this, but your bosoms are fine.<eos> There ain't nothing wrong with them.
This is my son.<eos> Why did you go? Why did you leave us?<eos> It's...<eos> It's a little hard to explain.<eos> It had nothing to do with any of you.<eos> It had everything to do with us.<eos> I abandoned you.<eos> I was walking home late one night.<eos> And... two men attacked me.<eos> One of them was your uncle.
Thank you very much, Bishop.<eos> - Good day.<eos> Did you see those horses?<eos> Weren't they something?<eos> I've never seen horses like that before.<eos> Two thousand dollars for a horse!<eos> A man could have a mansion with that kind of money!<eos> Those horses are going to be used for gambling.<eos> Gambling is a sin.<eos> Some of them come from Missouri and Arkansas.

- Yes, sir.<eos> Sure.<eos> - Are you out for a morning ride, are you?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> The truth is, I was admiring your horses yesterday, and I was hoping to get a closer look at them, if that's okay by you.<eos> Well, let's ride on down and get you that closer look.<eos> I'm always proud to show off our horses.<eos> - You like horses, do you?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> It seems I have a way with them.
He's the Bishop.<eos> I mean, it's his job.<eos> He has to keep people in line.<eos> What does your father do?<eos> My father says, "Judge not, lest ye be judged."<eos> Jesus said that, too.<eos> How does he keep control?<eos> How does he punish the sinners?<eos> He doesn't punish sinners.<eos> Their sins are between them and God.
Sir?<eos> I cannot do this.<eos> President Haight has counseled with Colonel Dame and has orders from him to put all of the emigrants out of the way.<eos> None who are old enough to talk are to be spared.<eos> Brethren.<eos> The entire camp are cut-throats, robbers and assassins.<eos> They are a part of the people who drove the Saints from Missouri, and who helped shed the blood of our prophets, Joseph and Hyrum.<eos> It is our orders from all in authority to get the emigrants from their stronghold.<eos> Brother Lee, the brethren in the priesthood are united in this.<eos> It would not go well with you to oppose them.
- Neither am I.<eos> Do you want to save your babies?<eos> Then put them into that wagon.<eos> There'll be armed guards all around.<eos> Your babies will be protected better than your gold.<eos> - Take good care of him, Reverend.<eos> - I will.<eos> Please comfort her, Reverend.<eos> She's so afraid.<eos> I will take care of them all as if they were my own Emily.

B:<eos> That charitable enterprises such as this would be the lifeblood of advanced civilizations even, perhaps especially in places like Trenton, New Jersey;<eos> That while this life here is infinitely preferable to the wretchedness of the suburbs, it's also not quite what I must have had in mind and maybe I miss some of the mundane thrills of policy debate.<eos> Yeah, I mean, all of that.<eos> This goes against my better judgment.<eos> It does. But what we'll need is one Affirmative case and one all-purpose Negative counterplan.<eos> We can't do a year's worth of work in one month, so we'll concentrate on those two lines of attack.<eos> You'll have to arrange with your parents... do you have parents?<eos> Oh, yeah, I have a... a mom that I see most days and... and I see my dad some weekends.<eos> You'll have to come to some arrangement with them or else let go of trying to so that you can spend evenings and weekends here.
You don't believe me either. - I do.<eos> My husband was murdered.<eos> You must've heard.<eos> The papers are full of all sorts of articles.<eos> I have to hide it all from the child.<eos> Please don't give me your condolences.<eos> I can't stand it, I've had it up to here.<eos> All those phony friends...<eos> Placing obituaries.<eos> One of them killed him, I'm convinced of it.
I'm afraid I must remain neutral in all of this.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me.<eos> If someone were to tell me that there exist among us authentic magicians, saints, bodhisattvas, or anyone endowed with miraculous powers, I would believe them.<eos> In a certain sense, what you say is true.<eos> But you've attained the freedom to accept or reject these new conditions to use them to finish your life's work, or not.<eos> Have you decided?<eos> To use them for good or for evil.<eos> Have you decided?<eos> Despite my precautions, I was afraid I would inadvertently give myself away conversing with professors and colleagues at the university.<eos> I knew more than any of them and understood things they never even suspected existed.
Oh, fuck, yeah, right.<eos> That was fun.<eos> I wonder if that donkey survived.<eos> Well, what do you think of the place?<eos> Ah, it's -- it's amazing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I kind of owe it all to you, you know?<eos> Me?<eos> Well, we always talked about running a con like this, right? - Yeah.<eos> You know, about how gullible people are, how they'll believe anything if you just tell it to them a couple of times?
Jury of my peers, and so on and so forth.<eos> Right.<eos> You know, my grandfather was, uh, an egg farmer.<eos> This isn't gonna be about your, uh... rough childhood, is it?<eos> No, I used to candle eggs at his farm.<eos> Do you know what that is?<eos> You hold an egg up to the light of a-a candle and, uh... you look for imperfections.<eos> The first time I did it... he told me to put all the eggs that were cracked... or flawed into a bucket for the bakery.<eos> And, uh, he came back an hour later... and there were 300 eggs in the bakery bucket.<eos> He asked me what the hell I was doing... but I found a flaw in every single one of them.
I'm Ginger Timpleman and I'm Charlie Fineman's mother-in-law.<eos> -Did you know Charlie's family?<eos> -No.<eos> His parents died when he was in grade school.<eos> He lived with an aunt before college.<eos> I met her a couple of times.<eos> She passed just before the wedding.<eos> You know, my wife and I, we tried to call him so many times.<eos> Hadn't seen him in years, and I read about what happened in the paper and I was just- - I was just heartbroken for him, you know?<eos> For them.
-Right.<eos> We already pay an obscene amount in liability insurance.<eos> You should tell your partners they can do to you what the girl wants to do.<eos> Fuck them.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's a five-year lease, 50 grand a month my name on it.<eos> My partners get pissed off and they leave me holding the bag, that's it, I'm done.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -I put the whole thing together.<eos> They act like I'm the one who works for them.
You wanna know what I remember about you from college?<eos> Nobody ever gave you any shit.<eos> You didn't take shit from anybody.<eos> You know what else?<eos> I hate what I do.<eos> You know, the money's good.<eos> But I swear to God, I hate putting phoney teeth on phoney people.<eos> But don't get me wrong.<eos> I'm a dentist, and when people need it, that's great.<eos> I feel for them.
I mean, you're- you're-<eos> Aaahhh... I can't describe you. I don't<eos> - I don't- I don't write that kind of shit.<eos> I write- you know, the people who write the real books, the love books and the poems and even those stupid little fucking novels with the hunky assholes on the cover.<eos> You know- you know what I'm talking about?<eos> You're, like, princess shit.<eos> You know, fairy tales. You know what I'm saying?<eos> The million guys are after her, and they're blinded by your beauty kind of shit.<eos> Real big stuff, you know- even we got the dick who kidnaps you and sticks you in a cave and you're guarded by a five-headed dragon, and, you know, the tales of your plight are spread throughout the land,<eos> and now all the guys go and put on their shoes so they can see what's up, but none of them have- have the balls to save her except for me.
I should've kept my mouth shut.<eos> And then I saw that guy walking around. I didn't know who he was.<eos> He was just some guy to me.<eos> And I guess I pissed him off.<eos> Denny, there's no way you could've known who he was, so just forget it.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Well, the other stuff I got taken care of is all straight.<eos> I got 18 whales.<eos> I spoke to their handlers, I spoke to their managers, I spoke to their assistants.<eos> Every one of them's gonna leave.
A blank cheque.<eos> Your math is very good.<eos> So fill it up.. with any number .<eos> Everything has a price.<eos> Who is it?<eos> He wants to buy me.<eos> He is putting a price tag on me?<eos> What he made in 150 years I made in 10 years. is it the same? - no.<eos> Get all our friends from the press right now.<eos> Call them.. go to their homes.. wake them.
I'll just tell him I found it somewhere.<eos> You have every right to feel the way you do but just so you know he was so happy to see you.<eos> Take care of yourself, okay?<eos> - Do you have your tickets?<eos> - Yeah, I think so.<eos> Do you have everything you need?<eos> Take it easy.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's go to New York.<eos> - Take care of them.
-Good evening.<eos> -What's this?<eos> -Leave application.<eos> Leave application?<eos> I won't be able to sing tonight.<eos> Why not?<eos> You see, sir, I have someone waiting for me and it's crucial l meet this person.<eos> Sir, I am so excited.<eos> What about all these people waiting for you to sing?<eos> Sir, don't worry, I'll personally apologize to each of them.
No contingencies, no loans, no nothing.<eos> Cash.<eos> Fabulous.<eos> I'm not talking about your proclivities, Richie.<eos> Those I only know too well.<eos> I'm talking about being a cop.<eos> You're talking about taking money?<eos> I don't do that. It's not my thing.<eos> What about your friends from the neighbourhood?<eos> - Do you still hang out with them?
I'm sure you're dying to see the rest of the house.<eos> Of course.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Thank you for a wonderful lunch.<eos> It was delicious.<eos> What do you think of monopolies?<eos> You mean like the game?<eos> No, I just think monopolies were made illegal in the country, Frank, 'cause nobody wants to compete, you know.<eos> Nobody wants to compete, not with a monopoly.<eos> I mean, you let the dairy farmers do that, half of them would be out of business tomorrow.
It's gotta be set.<eos> It's gotta be fair.<eos> Gotta be controlled by who?<eos> I set a price that I think is fair.<eos> - I don't think it's fair. - You don't?<eos> - I don't think it's fair.<eos> - I think it's fair.<eos> I mean, I know your customers are happy, Frank, bunch of fucking junkies that they are.<eos> But we fellow dairy farmers out here, Frank, are you thinking of us?<eos> You thinking of them?
Gotta be controlled by who?<eos> I set a price that I think is fair.<eos> - I don't think it's fair. - You don't?<eos> - I don't think it's fair.<eos> - I think it's fair.<eos> I mean, I know your customers are happy, Frank, bunch of fucking junkies that they are.<eos> But we fellow dairy farmers out here, Frank, are you thinking of us?<eos> You thinking of them?<eos> - The dairy farmers? - Yeah.<eos> I'm thinking of them, Dominic, about as much as they've ever thought about me.
- Latte?<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - You all right?<eos> That's a fancy way of saying coffee with milk.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - $2.50.<eos> So you been talking to your brothers?<eos> No, no, I ain't talked to them in years.<eos> It's probably best for them.
- Now, I brag-<eos> - Dad, listen to me.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> - Now-Now, I want you to listen to-<eos> - Dad, listen to me.<eos> - I brag to my buddies about you.<eos> - There's something I wanna talk to you about.<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> I wanna talk to you about something.<eos> - I brag to them all the time.
I deserve to be loved because I'm waiting to be loved.<eos> I know my day will come.<eos> Well, who wants to ask for help? Me.<eos> The day my husband left me... you know what he said?<eos> "Be healthy."<eos> I showed no emotion.<eos> I went out with many guys.<eos> I wanted to have fun but... each time was worse.<eos> I felt empty, alone.<eos> So I realised the problem wasn't them.
Does anybody have any thoughts on this?<eos> Can I talk?<eos> - Mimzy'd like to speak to you.<eos> - She wants to speak?<eos> Where?<eos> She's in the other room.<eos> She's telling me what to say.<eos> The people in the future can't travel through time.<eos> They need our help.<eos> Something in them is broken.
- May I say something, please?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I've been in this neighborhood for almost 67 years.<eos> I've watched Dr. King walk this very street to go to the barbershop.<eos> I remember Billie Holiday who checked into what used to be the only hotel in the South that would allow black people, right here on Auburn Avenue.<eos> What I remember most is we used to be a people that would take care of ourselves.<eos> Nobody never gave us nothing.<eos> We all earned it.<eos> We look at these politicians and ask that they help.<eos> It ain't up to them.
- No.<eos> - No?<eos> - No.<eos> - Oh, you're on time today.<eos> - Well, he's on time all right.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - What happened to you?<eos> - Some thugs tried to break in here.<eos> I fought them out.<eos> Before that happened one of them cut me.
Armand, these women you take me for give themselves, but they fight.<eos> Well, I fought, but here I am.<eos> I love you.<eos> I am yours.<eos> Madame, Antoinette cannot save the Duchesse de Langeais.<eos> I believe neither one nor the other.<eos> Armand, who are these men?<eos> What will you do to me?<eos> These men are as discreet as I am on what will be done here.<eos> Look on them as my instruments.

The Trials of Arabella, by Briony Tallis.<eos> Cee.<eos> -Yes?<eos> What do you think it would feel like to be someone else?<eos> Cooler, I should hope.<eos> -I'm worried about the play.<eos> -I'm sure it's a masterpiece.<eos> But we only have the afternoon to rehearse.<eos> What if the twins can't act?<eos> You have to be nice to them.
-Now what are we going to do?<eos> -I'm always asking myself that.<eos> My name is Paul Marshall.<eos> You must be the cousins from the north.<eos> -What are your names?<eos> -Pierrot.<eos> -Jackson.<eos> -What marvellous names.<eos> Do you know our parents?<eos> Well, I've read about them in the paper.

Yes, sir.<eos> Our kids from the mentor program are here.<eos> I want you to give them a tour.<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> Which kids?<eos> Yours, mine, and John Jr.'s.<eos> We're all doing it.<eos> Now, John Jr. and I have a meeting, so they're waiting for you in the lobby.<eos> Oh, and the two boys are coming hunting with us Saturday.<eos> Your brother has some guns waiting at the store for them.
They're just fucking rocks.<eos> I'm not gonna let you bastards get me.<eos> Not me. Not today.<eos> This is not gonna happen.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> There's a breeze.<eos> Shit.<eos> This is where the fuckers hid to cut the ropes.<eos> We can't just leave them down there.<eos> There's nothing we can do for them now.
Then I go to office.<eos> A simple life.<eos> I come back.<eos> I sleep.<eos> And how do you like me?<eos> I feel like adopting a dog and spending my life with it.<eos> How's he to look at?<eos> He was fine eight years ago, at least in the photo.<eos> Perfect men only exist in novels.<eos> And most of them are married.
He was so worried.<eos> He'll be back in a few days<eos> I beg you.<eos> Try and understand<eos> Why are you doing all this?<eos> For a raise?<eos> Driver, take that left<eos> I was born here... in Bombay.<eos> But after father's death we went to Bhillai.<eos> When people used to eat at the restaurant my dad would stand next to them and play the violin.
I can't tell you that.<eos> Well I can't have this conversation anymore.<eos> -"Can't" is a choice.<eos> Am I resisting you now?<eos> Are you?<eos> Dr. Heker. My psychiatrist.<eos> She only cares about the, like, eighty bucks an hour she paid, or whatever, to prevent me from turning into a psycho.<eos> Well, it's kind of too late for that.<eos> When things happen to people, they radiate a light.<eos> Because they've got a picture caught inside them.
A criminal named Rashid... has been on a bombing campaign for two years.<eos> In the last few months, suddenly his explosives... are more sophisticated, more deadly.<eos> You are an engineer. You have the chemical know-how.<eos> We have direct calls to you from a number linked to Rashid.<eos> What are we to think? You tell me.<eos> What are we to think?<eos> It's a mistake.<eos> It's a mistake.<eos> A mistake.<eos> What if I were to tell you that we have a signed confession... from one of Rashid's lieutenants... that you have been aiding them for more than a year?
Like that thing, man.<eos> One day... you gots nobody.<eos> Danny... I think it's her.<eos> I think it's Jean Lerner.<eos> Fuckin' Pierre, man.<eos> Yo, what's up?<eos> Alright.<eos> Eddie!<eos> Gotta show you something.<eos> Gelb's only had three assistants in four years and one of them's on our database.
- Yeah. Can't blame 'em, can you?<eos> I mean, they've got families.<eos> I'd be the same.<eos> They've been completely ripped off.<eos> Anyway, what are your plans?<eos> - I have two Polish friends. - Mm-hm.<eos> Starting business.<eos> Very clever.<eos> Will soon be rich.<eos> They asked me to join them but I want to go home when I save some money.
8 years of war for nothing.<eos> A million dead for nothing.<eos> The last days were horrifying.<eos> A month before the armistice, Irak bombed Teheran on a daily basis.<eos> As if it had to be wiped out from the map.<eos> Just before the ceasefire, the government got scared because some opponents had fled to Iran.<eos> The government was afraid of the threat that represented the thousands of political prisoners.<eos> So the state decided to put an end to it the hard way.<eos> They proposed to the convicts to renounce their ideals, to promise to be loyal to the regime and to serve their sentence or to be executed.<eos> Most of them were executed.
Francol Francol Testing...<eos> How considerate.<eos> What about me?<eos> You smoke?<eos> No, silly.<eos> Good.<eos> If these people saw you, they might shave your head.<eos> "These people"?<eos> What about you?<eos> You don't think I'm like them...
Don't stop studying. Keep learning French.<eos> - Mom...<eos> - The kid's right.<eos> Who needs French anyway?<eos> The goal was to bring down the new government.<eos> The statements made by these 56 individuals leave no doubt:<eos> The plan was to reorganize the Socialist Youth, the clandestine, Marxist-inspired organization whose aim was to provoke disorder and sabotage initiatives contributing to the greater glory of the nation through infamy, lies terrorist attacks, class struggle... basically, Communism and Free Masonry.<eos> Thanks to their arrest, we thwarted a terrorist attack planned for the day of the Victory Parade, for which they had gathered in the previous days all sorts of weaponry abandoned in trenches and sewers.<eos> The accused are guilty of supporting the rebellion as penalized by articles 237 and 238 in the second paragraph of the Code of Military Justice, with the aggravating circumstance of withholding evidence and endangerment, cited in article 173 of the legal code.<eos> Therefore, on behalf of the Head of State, the prosecution asks that each and every one of them be given the death penalty.
How do you do that swing-step you did last night?<eos> That's easy.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> So, I called last night.<eos> I got hung up at the gym.<eos> Hey, my dad says you're doing great with those college guys.<eos> Oh. Yeah. They're awesome.<eos> Playing with them is like being in another world.
Give it up for Byron.<eos> From Los Angeles, California. We have Pablo.<eos> Last but not least, from Santa Fe, New Mexico. The lovely and talented, Jewel.<eos> Arert they the greatest?<eos> These six people are some of the finest folks you'll ever meet.<eos> Drawn across this great country of ours and before this evening is over... Eight, eight. We'll get to know all these wonderful folks a whole lot better.<eos> These ladies and gentlemen are checks.<eos> Checks made out for five million dollars but the names are not there.<eos> Why?<eos> Because only 5 of these heroes will take them home.
You don't work here, do you?<eos> It's ok.<eos> Maybe if we looked together.<eos> No, it's ok.<eos> I'll ask at the enquiry desk.<eos> They probably have it locked up in the rare items archive.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Activate the scanners.<eos> I'm only picking up three signals.<eos> One of them must be offworld.
Previously, on Stargate SG-1.<eos> Merlin was conducting research on some kind of new invention.<eos> A weapon capable of destroying ascended beings.<eos> Here lies Meardon. Archmage of the realm.<eos> He's dead.<eos> We've seen it used to download information into someones mind.<eos> - You have Merlin's memories.<eos> - Some of them.
He let me go to hospital.<eos> Such a kind man.<eos> I took my car, stopped at a red light, this Chinese man rammed me hard from behind with his Jeep.<eos> The insurance Board refuses to pay.<eos> They say it was a work-related accident.<eos> The Work Benefits Agency says it was a car accident.<eos> I was hoping for a quick settlement. But the best-laid plans often go ashore...<eos> - Do you have any savings?<eos> - Not much.<eos> - This conflict involves 2 government agencies. Getting them to communicate takes forever.
Nobody told me this.<eos> I learned it in an e-mail that was attached by accident to another e-mail sent to me.<eos> I decided that, before Adam is born, I have to confront everything that happened to Danny.<eos> He was held in an isolated shack in a compound on the outskirts of Karachi.<eos> One day, when he was unshackled to go to the toilet, he tried to escape.<eos> They caught him and chained him to the engine of a car.<eos> Another time he tried to break loose when he was walking with his captors.<eos> Once he shouted to a passerby.<eos> Then, one day, probably February 1st, three men who spoke Arabic were brought to the compound.<eos> Danny argued with one of them.
Sounder is a super old dog.<eos> She's almost 11, she's got cataracts, and under her coat you'll feel some tumors, but that just what happens as they get older.<eos> She has some incontinence, but that's to be expective.<eos> I'm sure you've had to deal with that with all the older dogs you've taken.<eos> Oh, yeah, I've dealt with<eos> - incontinence a lot.<eos> - Oh, don't be upset, Debbie.<eos> She's... she's not in pain.<eos> Oh I think it's so lovely what you do for old dogs.<eos> Taking them into care foster in their final days.
Deep.<eos> A lot of fish.<eos> What is the helmet for?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - Just thinking of old days, that's all.<eos> - Old days?<eos> Not today.<eos> - Soldiers leaving.<eos> - You mean me?<eos> Leaving with them?
You should go.<eos> - Jimmy, take her upstairs.<eos> - No, you take her upstairs.<eos> No, no, no, no one's taking anybody upstairs.<eos> You wanna tell us what we're doin' down here?<eos> Shut up, Jimmy, okay?<eos> You know what's funny?<eos> There's all these people right up there... and we're down in here just a few feet away.<eos> Something totally different goin' on, you know?<eos> And them none the wiser.
Buy me a week.<eos> He wants closure on this.<eos> Not as much as I do.<eos> Deanna, there are so many other people here who need you...<eos> People in pain, people who've lost hope... Lives you could be saving.<eos> You're a gifted Doctor, and...<eos> Well, I honestly think you're throwing away the chance to make a difference.<eos> I care about these people.<eos> That's why I'm doing this.<eos> I'm doing this for them.
Yeah.<eos> Um, I went to Jared's around seven or eight... and then I dropped him off at the bus station shortly after that.<eos> And then drove around...<eos> Oh yeah, that's something I got confused about before 'cause...<eos> I didn't go back to my house, I went back to Jared's 'cause...<eos> Jared and I planned to stay at his house that night... originally.<eos> OK, that's fine.<eos> So, where was his parents?<eos> His mom was... in Las Vegas and...<eos> his dad doesn't live with them.
Tina, this is Jodi Lerner.<eos> This is Tina.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Nice to meet you too.<eos> Hi!<eos> I'm gonna go get her diaper bag.<eos> You're teaching her to sign.<eos> I haven't even done anything. She just started doing it on her own.<eos> Babies learn quick.<eos> Sign language is easy for them.
- Hi. How are you?<eos> - Good.<eos> - Oh, hi Tina.<eos> I have good news for you.<eos> - That's looking good.<eos> - Great!<eos> Oh, what's looking good for Tina?<eos> Oh, Tina's company is trying to buy the movie rights to my book.<eos> So, my agents are supposed to be here soon, and they... 3 offers on the table and you're in the running.<eos> So, I'd like you to talk to them tonight.
Come on, let me show you what it's like to be treated like a lady.<eos> Those people were so ignorant. It makes me insane.<eos> Well, they're not my people, they're Jenny's agents.<eos> Yeah, and what about that girl?<eos> - She works for you.<eos> - Grace?<eos> Yeah, but you saw it, I was introduced to her for the first time.<eos> Come on, Alice.<eos> Stop frighten, ok? That's your world.<eos> You were right in there with them, they're all there, knee-jerk liberal bullshit.
It's been over three months since my last confession.<eos> What's on your mind, Mary-Elizabeth ?<eos> Father Anthony, I was hoping it was you.<eos> I...<eos> I don't know how to start.<eos> I...<eos> I've been having visions and...<eos> horrible, horrible dreams.<eos> I have one about you and the day that we buried my mother.<eos> Dreams allow us to acknowledge the inner urges we repress without actually acting on them.
If these gods are truly worthy of our devotion, then pray to them.<eos> No god should ever ask you to kill an innocent man to prove your sanctity.<eos> I know you're afraid.<eos> We all are.<eos> But if you are going to die, let us die in noble peace and truth of spirit.<eos> Why do they not reveal themselves?<eos> - Who?<eos> - Your friends.<eos> They're concealing a building on the planet's surface.<eos> The Prior plans to destroy the village because of them.
-What's that, man?<eos> -You son of a bitch!<eos> -Man, don't do that!<eos> -Our talking has to be straight if it's twisted, you will answer personally for it.<eos> Got it?<eos> -Take this shit!<eos> Look at this picture.<eos> Study it.<eos> Let's go!<eos> When the candidates came to the BOPE training, the corrupt came with them.
So what?<eos> I'm happy to meetyou.<eos> Can you dance?<eos> This is my bed.<eos> You go there and sleep.<eos> Forget it... Correct.<eos> Hello.. I'm Nethra. vidya.<eos> Yeah. I know. I saw you scoring 4, 5 goals at the south zone tournament.<eos> My time and luck was good.<eos> For good people, luck will always be with them.
You were with Morse when we last met.<eos> That's right, ma'am.<eos> Shame about that<eos> - Morse.<eos> Had his querulous side, of course.<eos> But we're none of us perfect.<eos> No. No, we're not.<eos> Drop me back at the station and get down to the telephone exchange.<eos> I want names to go with all these numbers.<eos> If one of them did get Greely up here, I want to know which one and why.
At this instant, we were beautiful inside but pitiful outside...<eos> - Stop laughing, fuck!<eos> Deep inside us, very deeply, it was a new birth.<eos> The universe was offering us a second chance.<eos> - Thank you. - And there are your baggages...<eos> - No, that's fine, I'll take it, thank you.<eos> Dulère had to be blasted, then I had to disappear, very quickly.<eos> To help me realease the commercial, I contacted the AAF guys.<eos> The Anti-Ads Front, a secret activist small group Charlie dug out on internet.<eos> - You behave, exactly like them, here... Watch out, Seb...
All done.<eos> Do you think your dad's leading you guys down an unrighteous path?<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I think my Dad is.<eos> What's he doing?<eos> Most people believe you should only have one wife.<eos> Smokers, drinkers, sex, fags.<eos> What our dads are doing you and I, we can't have it.<eos> That's them.
Let's go back inside.<eos> Baby, what are you--?<eos> Baby, what are you doing?<eos> I came to say goodbye.<eos> Goodbye?<eos> What do you mean, goodbye?<eos> What do you--?<eos> Do you think those people give a damn about you?<eos> Do you think they care that you almost got killed protecting their son?<eos> I'm not doing this for them.
Help?<eos> The building I live in is being run over by a bunch of drug dealers.<eos> I've been there for 30 years.<eos> It was always a good building.<eos> Now you can't get in or out.<eos> You should go to the cops with that.<eos> I call, they come, the scum scatter, and five minutes later, the cockroaches are back.<eos> Okay. Then the person you really need is Dokey.<eos> Huey's brother? Yeah. I tried.<eos> The bastard wouldn't even talk to me. I mean, he might as well be one of them.
"Get a black market organ and watch your family die a terrible death."<eos> Look, Skip, you don't scare me.<eos> I'm not finished.<eos> It's totally corrupt and disgusting.<eos> It's supply and demand, Carlos.<eos> Bare-knuckle capitalism.<eos> Kidney, who's got a kidney?<eos> I heard that in Manila, when cops shoot a criminal, they harvest organs - before contacting next-of-kin.<eos> What about the thousands of helpless people on waiting lists for organs?<eos> I mean, 15% of them die.
One day, I thought... I thought I would be so brave.<eos> I would have the courage to bring my enemies to their knees, like the great Jaffa warrior, Teal'c.<eos> Fight!<eos> Look at you now.<eos> A legend.<eos> You defeated the mighty Goa'uld themselves.<eos> You brought freedom to all Jaffa.<eos> You gave us the chance to seek salvation, but you, you rejected it yourself.<eos> Your punishment must be to have gotten so soft and frail.<eos> Have you spent so long with humans that you've become so much like them?
It is these people who brought this upon us.<eos> They-- people who refused to bend to the will of God, and claim it privilege.<eos> Sinners in pride.<eos> Yes, haughty.<eos> Privileged!<eos> They mock us.<eos> They mock our-- our God, our faith, our values, our very lifestyle.<eos> They mock our humility and our piousness.<eos> They piss on us and laugh.<eos> It's from them the blood of human sacrifice must come.
EVERYTHING I NEED FOR THE PERFECT WEDDING<eos> IS RIGHT HERE.<eos> OH, SEE, STEVE,<eos> AND YOU DIDN'T WANT TO PAY EXTRA FOR THE CHAIR COVERS.<eos> WERE YOU GETTING MARRIED?<eos> ALL OF YOU?<eos> YOU KNOW WHAT?<eos> NONE OF THAT IS IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW.<eos> YOU'RE HERE, THE GUESTS ARE HERE,<eos> A LOT OF THEM ARE DRUNK, UH...
You know who she is!<eos> You talk like a fool!<eos> Her protection's gone.<eos> Girl like that always has protection.<eos> You think you chasin the lamb?<eos> That's when you get gored.<eos> You want to find her?<eos> Wake up?<eos> You tell them boys to look stronger.<eos> Cause if they don't find her... my babies's gonna find them.
Okay, this is not about you hating magic.<eos> Are you going to tell me, or what?<eos> Come on, I'm all ears.<eos> In the '20s I visited Haiti with a woman I met in Paris, with a woman I met in Paris,<eos> She was... keen to experience the world and everything in it.<eos> She'd heard of a... a voodoo ceremony taking place and insisted we go.<eos> I was so full of my own power I was sure we'd be safe.<eos> When we got there it was like the crowd was electrified.<eos> People dancing, drinking,<eos> calling to the spirits, asking them to take over their bodies and live through them.
Those boys only like you because you make it so easy for them.<eos> You're not a challenge- you're a tease.<eos> It's not like they actually care who you are.<eos> Ok, ok, calm down.<eos> I didn't mean what I said.<eos> Look, maybe I just said it because I was a little... Jealous.<eos> What?<eos> You were jealous of me?<eos> Um, but, you're the most beautiful, smartest, perfect girl in the world.<eos> Well, you're right about all those things. But for some reason when I meet boys they act as if I'm going to do something horrible to them.

Oh, my God, I am.<eos> I'm a total...<eos> Runt!<eos> I lost my kitten.<eos> Has anyone seen my runt?<eos> Bringing Tracy Jordan was a smart move, Jack.<eos> He's the hit of the party.<eos> You got that right, my friend.<eos> Tomorrow I'm gonna be in an intense six hour foursome with three other men.<eos> And one of them will be Don Geiss and he's gonna get all of my attention.
Just.... stay here.<eos> Halt.<eos> Disarm rebel dogs!<eos> He left himself wide open from behind.<eos> That was a mistake.<eos> One of the hostages is a nurse.<eos> She was able to stabilize the wounded guard.<eos> Finally, some good news.<eos> It is my belief, these men in fact are not rebels, but common thieves.<eos> Now, if we rise up against them....
- No.<eos> - No?<eos> Okay, well, let's read some more.<eos> Where were you?<eos> - Right there.<eos> - All right.<eos> "You tell nick that he's got to get all the corpse"<eos> What is this?<eos> "She opened the package wondering if he had sent a doll and also wondering what she should do with it if he had.<eos> There were several beautiful books, that just Colin had, and two of them were of gardens and...
I know what you're thinking, detective, that i'm a shut-the-door-behind-me type.<eos> "i got mine, now you all go back home."<eos> but that's not it at all.<eos> In the 20-odd years i've been here, it's completely changed.<eos> It's a multi-billion dollar criminal enterprise now.<eos> You got coyotes, brokers, on both sides of the border.<eos> The gangs are all over it now.<eos> Used to be, it was just people...<eos> You know, people like me, looking for a better life.<eos> Now it's thousands upon thousands looking to make an easy buck and bring their families with them.
If anything, i'd rather help you integrate whatever private hell you've been going through so you can be a better cop.<eos> You wanna make me a better cop?<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Tell me about yourself.<eos> What, uh, what would you like to know?<eos> - Where did you grow up?<eos> - New york.<eos> - Parents?<eos> - One of each.<eos> Tell me about them.
in 1948, I was a special agent with CIC that's out intellgence core in occupying Germany that was a station in Augsburg and as I spoke fluent Germany<eos> I was assigned to handle the network of Germany formers Among them was Klaus Barbie.<eos> And Klaus Barbie was later on that I discovered he was one of the murder by French and I reported this to my superior they told me to keep nice and quite he's still valuable when he's no longer valuable we turn him over to the French<eos> I thought I was gonna get the promotion when I told him about Barbi and he told me to keep quite that was a idea of ends the problem but that of course was Nazi's idea and totalitarian's idea<eos> secondly hmm... the idea was Nazi knew something about the Russians but wait a minute, who wanted the war how did you decide they own the experts when they were defeated by the Russians<eos> Reinhard Gehlen was Chef of Germany military intelligence East front during World War II during the invasion of the US SR<eos> The Nazis forces captured hundreds of thousand of Soviet POW and they put them in his camp where they were starved until to death<eos> Gehlen's guys went to the camp to interrogate those prisoners if prisoners were cooperating maybe they got a littile bit of food if they didn't cooperate they starved to death something about the order of seven millions people died in this camp<eos> so Gehlen was scientist cruel and ferocious after the war, Gehlen was recruited by the US intelligent and mostly particularly by who eventually became the director of CIA we were able to identify at east one hundred war criminals who were a part of his network<eos> the other problem was the Nazi war criminals had the agenda the more them described the Russian threat the more you needed them because they were the core on core of experts
Not under present circumstances.<eos> Come on.<eos> My men deserted to your side with amazing alacrity.<eos> Not a single blow struck, yet my camp is empty.<eos> Amazing.<eos> Yes, I really must write to Cicero and the Senate.<eos> It was remarkably generous of them to give me so many fresh troops.<eos> I confess I had no idea how popular you are with the rank and file.<eos> Soldiers like a little spit and dirt in their leaders.<eos> You were too -- noble for them, perhaps.
That's not right.<eos> - The gods don't like it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What more can the gods do to me?<eos> How can they punish me now?<eos> Don't know.<eos> Don't wanna find out.<eos> Have you heard the good news?<eos> I have.<eos> This is the beginning of the end for them.
And then at bed, all you're doing is just reading to them probably telling them the same goddamn story for the hundredth time.<eos> Then, after all that, then I am ready to have sex, because all that is so hot.<eos> Our entire life.<eos> That's what you just trashed.<eos> Our entire life.<eos> - You all right?<eos> It's Columbus Day.<eos> The kids are at home.<eos> They want to go home with their kids.<eos> You're not gonna get anything from them, anyway.
I don't know why you're so intent on being a couple.<eos> Like, what's so great about it?<eos> It's like all you care about is being stuck in some long-term thing.<eos> I mean, why?<eos> What do you mean, why?<eos> Because I wanna be with someone.<eos> I wanna spend my life with someone, all right.<eos> That's what I want.<eos> You're as retro as these guys.<eos> Marry one of them.
Because if that was the case, you know I think I could help you.<eos> He said he loved me but he didn't even know me and then when I tried to leave, he... he grabbed me and he-he raped me.<eos> - And... and-and... and then he went and he told everyone, and-and they said that I deserved it because I was vain and it was my fault.<eos> - So you were innocent and they blamed you.<eos> They destroyed me, they-they made me hideous.<eos> - No, You're not.<eos> I am. I've done things.<eos> You don't know.<eos> You can't let these people just walk around like they own everything that they see.<eos> So you take care of them.
No, you know it has...<eos> I breathed in and out again.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah.<eos> I swear, one of these days... What?<eos> What you gonna do?<eos> Huh?<eos> I wish you would.<eos> You know I got 5 brothers...<eos> Hello, hello.<eos> - Like I'm scared of them.
-We wait for them to move.<eos> So, Knapp, what do you do?<eos> What do you do when you're not doing this?<eos> -What do you mean?<eos> -Well, personal life?<eos> -Yeah, it's quiet. -Yeah?<eos> You like that?<eos> I don't much care for people.<eos> -Why?<eos> -Because, on a daily basis they show me the worst of them.
Did any of you happen to see what happened?<eos> We were inside the house when we heard the shot.<eos> They won't take Ben and Danny away from me, will they?<eos> I mean, I am their sister.<eos> Well, let's worry about first things first.<eos> Let's find whoever did this to Jesse.<eos> Hey.<eos> Metcraft work boots.<eos> Those are prison issue, aren't they?<eos> Yeah, and they're also the only thing that ex- cons take with them when they get out so I'm searching the Department of Corrections database.
It might be internal bleeding.<eos> He needs to go first, okay?<eos> This guy fired the rocket.<eos> Weapon's exhaust must've cooked him.<eos> More concerned about being concealed than his own safety, Frank.<eos> Frank.<eos> I'm going to need surveillance tapes from the courtroom.<eos> Are my brothers okay out there?<eos> They'll be fine.<eos> They've got an officer with them.
Open the stores!<eos> Give me what I need<eos> No!<eos> Pang Qing-Yun!<eos> I knew you were a liar!<eos> This bread... Was meant for our brothers<eos> But you want to give half to the captives... and then the other half to the civilians<eos> Our brothers have fought for 9 months... and starved for 9 months!<eos> You tell me...<eos> Who should get this bread, them or us?
Why do I have to suffer because of you two?<eos> Margie, you have free will here.<eos> But if you ever want us to back you up in the future, you'll do this.<eos> It's only fair.<eos> Selma and I have sent you another token of our fraternal esteem.<eos> Thank you, Hollis.<eos> Thank you for the information.<eos> The coal mine was a soft target.<eos> We sent Roman's illegal alien workers running.<eos> Without them, his unit labor costs will skyrocket.
You and Carmichael partners.<eos> Nice business plan.<eos> We were partners, 'til somebody got scared.<eos> Billy!<eos> Come forward.<eos> The power to resurrect the dead and this is how you use it?<eos> This is how it was meant to be used.<eos> I'm not going to grow old massaging dead people's hands.<eos> I spent years watching my father fawning over them like they were something special.<eos> More concerned about them than his own family.
- What does that mean?<eos> That he's ready to let the demon through?<eos> Not quite.<eos> He still needs a few more things.<eos> Unfortunately, I happen to be one of them.<eos> So whoever it was has the chalice.<eos> But everything else is still safe, right?<eos> Henry thought the chalice was safe.<eos> I don't care what Maurice says about these things not being able to be destroyed.<eos> I want five minutes alone with them and a sledgehammer.
The order was placed.<eos> I can certainly tell you how much. Our technicians handle several alibi accounts simultaneously.<eos> Alibi accounts?<eos> Come on.<eos> What kind of game you playing here?<eos> It's a business. You know, some people need help dealing with sensitive issues that come their way.<eos> Those issues include murder?<eos> I'm sorry. Last I checked, murder was not on our list of services.<eos> We mostly deal with extramarital affairs, you know, excuses for work-related absences.<eos> Yeah. So basically, people pay you to lie for them and make it look real?
Okay.<eos> Great.<eos> We're both drug free and ready for a good night's sleep.<eos> Don't let the bed bugs bite.<eos> I won't.<eos> The ambulance drivers?<eos> They found them?<eos> They were there?<eos> Oh, yeah, we found 'em.<eos> What's left of them anyway.
We found a jar with three dead rats in it in the back of Gary's car.<eos> Wow. That's weird.<eos> That doesn't sound like Gary, not that I know what he's like.<eos> I understand.<eos> I just figured they must have come from the lab you guys worked at.<eos> I don't know. I kind of doubt that.<eos> These are industrial clients, big companies.<eos> They need to be sure their product's safe;<eos> all the rats tagged and numbered.<eos> We have to document everything we do to each and every one of them.
Right above this ladder... you do a quick left and then a hard right turn.<eos> See how it went down, it went down again.<eos> You gotta get pass all the barrels, the fireballs, get up the ladders, and as soon as you get to her<eos> Donkey Kong takes her away to the next level.<eos> The average Donkey Kong game doesn't last a minute.<eos> It's absolute brutality.<eos> Each of the 18 elevator boards ...represents the greatest challenge in video game playing.<eos> The average gamer of Donkey Kong... will never get pass the third elevator stage.<eos> The slightest touch from one of these springs kills you.<eos> There is no hammer for them, there is no way to defeat them.
The country is under attack, Sondra.<eos> We cannot pretend it isn't.<eos> Who are you calling?<eos> Yes, it's Sondra Palmer.<eos> I'd like to speak with my brother.<eos> We're still sweeping the target zone.<eos> We've recovered four bodies.<eos> Forensics are running field ID now.<eos> They're sending data back to CTU.<eos> Well, let's hope one of them is Assad.
Victor showed up just after D-day.<eos> - He only made it for a couple of hours.<eos> - Did you kill him?<eos> It was the radiation from Denver.<eos> No one else made it back here to the rally point?<eos> No.<eos> Are you gonna tell me how you got out of that room?<eos> Three armed guys, cuffs?<eos> Three guys and cuffs keep you in that room?<eos> One of them got too close.
Somebody's gotta go.<eos> Well, it just seems like that someone is always you.<eos> Gray's having a few bags of salt packed up for us to trade.<eos> Smart.<eos> Who else is going?<eos> Apparently Heather.<eos> Gray thinks I should take a couple of the guys from border patrol.<eos> That's it?<eos> I'm not sure pulling them off patrol just to watch my back is such a good idea.<eos> Besides, only a handful of them even know what they're doing.
You don't mind if we talk a little business, do you?<eos> - All right.<eos> - Move it!<eos> So, what did my buddy up north have to say?<eos> Hurry!<eos> Thanks for coming, partner.<eos> Glad you're here.<eos> The crew does look good.<eos> I see you still got the twins with you, and they are still riding their own material.<eos> - Never leave home without them.
- i'm just saying i'm not prejudiced.<eos> i haven't seen that many, there's billions- literally, billions of dicks in the world, and i've seen, like, 40 at the most, so how the fuck would i know?<eos> what, is that too many?<eos> - ha ha, yeah, that's too many, right?<eos> 40, jesus christ.<eos> i'm only 39, that's a dick a year plus another one. why am i saying 40?<eos> that's like 2 bags of dicks right there, at least, 40 dicks?<eos> all right.<eos> - i ver understood people, uh, uh- judging people for the way they have sex.<eos> some people get angry at homosexuals just for being gay, they get mad at them, urr!
- I don't have a sister.<eos> - Daniel...<eos> Betty, we have an issue to get out, and I need coffee-- lots of it.<eos> Henry.<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Hiding.<eos> When paparazzi are stalking accountants, you know it's bad.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> They were following me, too, and one of them thought that my glasses and nose were a disguise.
- You're disgusting.<eos> Yeah. That's a good start.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Jenna had no business telling you guys that.<eos> Oh, hey. Blue pages.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Jenna told the writers that I am looking for a guy to get me pregnant.<eos> - Can you believe her?<eos> - I know. it's so uncool.<eos> Why would she go to them?
ARE YOU SURE?<eos> ABSOLUTELY.<eos> YEAH.<eos> NOW, ALICE, DANNY...<eos> I KNOW YOU'RE READY.<eos> I KNOW YOUR HEARTS ARE FULL.<eos> SO LET'S GET ON WITH THIS SICK LITTLE JOKE.<eos> WHY D I THINK<eos> THAT I WAS ANY DIFFERENT THAN ALL THE COUPLES I MARRY?<eos> NONE OF THEM ARE RIGHT FOR EACH OTHER.
Yeah, move in.<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I don't think this is gonna help.<eos> Four-six, four-five, clear.<eos> Somebody was here.<eos> Signs of a struggle.<eos> This is Chopper 1.<eos> We got two men on the roof.<eos> One of them's armed.
Then I'll do my best, sir.<eos> Report to Bill Buchanan at CTU and call me any time you think it's necessary.<eos> - Yes, Mr President.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> The President wants me to run the search for Fayed and Numair.<eos> I can't do this without your help, Curtis.<eos> I need you to accept Assad as part of this investigation.<eos> He knows this people, he knows what to look for.<eos> He will see things that you and I would miss.<eos> He knows this people because he's one of them, Jack.
I'm on the corner of Glasgow and 15th.<eos> --Colonel, Fayed has to be at least partially state-supported.<eos> Have your guys identified a country?<eos> Not yet, sir.<eos> Uh, CIA has narrowed down the list.<eos> It's on your screen in the short brief section.<eos> Have you been in touch with the ambassadors of these countries?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> They all extend their condolences and have, of course, disavowed any role in the attacks.<eos> Well, we know at least one of them's lying.
I see the room now.<eos> Damn it.<eos> It's disabled.<eos> Get an entry team down here now.<eos> Need an entry team at door 237.<eos> The men that were holding you, when they called me there were within an hour of my motel.<eos> When they moved you, can you remember if, if you took surface streets or the freeway, anything that can help us find them?<eos> I want them to pay for what they've done.<eos> I know what you've been through.<eos> I know what it's like to feel like it's never going to end... to hate them that much, and then need them... to start blaming yourself for everything that's happening to you.
Do I have your attention?<eos> 'Cause I only want to do this once.<eos> I have 25 soldiers that are about to put their asses on the line.<eos> Whether they live or die largely depends on what gets done here.<eos> That's not to mention the larger threat of three nuclear weapons that may be down the street, for all we know.<eos> So, if anyone has a problem taking orders from me without giving me lip, tell me now, and I will have you reassigned.<eos> Doyle.<eos> You keep your hands off my people.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> They need to understand what I expect from them.
Get down!<eos> Down on the ground!<eos> Colby, you okay?<eos> We're good, Don.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Crates are all here, full.<eos> The guidance systems accounted for.<eos> How about missiles?<eos> Any sign of them?
And these cables, do any of them run into the ocean?<eos> Yes, there is an underwater beacon that emits sonar pings to help guide in the vessels.<eos> - By vessels, you mean submarines?<eos> The Initiative used one to bring us here.<eos> But I imagine the Hostiles have either destroyed or commandeered it by now.<eos> That explains how they were able to get around my position - and capture our sailboat.<eos> - You had a sailboat?<eos> Until we lost it to your Hostiles.<eos> That's very unfortunate.<eos> Well at least we were able to kill one of them.
Thanks.<eos> - Which way?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It's... not showing me anything, it's useless.<eos> This way.<eos> You are the one who has done all this?<eos> All this?<eos> This... experiment.<eos> You murdered those people.<eos> You allowed those bugs to feed on them.
All drunks are, probably, taking all type of drugs.<eos> - Jodidos are.<eos> - But... If I go it is to make sure that they don't kill them.<eos> - It is this way, when you go. - They killed us.<eos> Hello affection, I don't have a lot of time but taenia that to send you this.<eos> First want you to know that I love you a lot.<eos> I miss you more to daily and I am not able to to wait to speak to you to the face.<eos> He/she was seeing the picture that you sent me of you and the boys, he/she would want to be there instead of here.<eos> The boys have been drinking the whole day and it seems that they will leave to look for problems.<eos> Not I can stop them but I will go to to make sure that they don't leave wounded.
You all right?<eos> What?<eos> You seem unhappy.<eos> I am unhappy.<eos> Tired of people using religion to justify the terrible things they do.<eos> You're saying these killers are on a mission?<eos> These unsubs believe they're either on a mission from god or that the bible was somehow guiding them.<eos> Unsubs? That stands for unknown subjects.<eos> The killers,working as a team.<eos> It sounded to me like only one of them was into the mission.
You have one hour to make a decision, or we come through those doors full automatic.<eos> Scramble your men.<eos> Five minutes, then we go in.<eos> What?<eos> Hendrickson, they've let out one hostage so far.<eos> They've hurt no one as far as we can tell.<eos> You don't know these winchesters.<eos> They're dangerous and expertly trained.<eos> We can't risk the lives of all those people.<eos> Dean's a greater risk to them than we are.
- Every soldier in our army... is going door-to-door in the city conducting searches.<eos> A benefit of our form of government.<eos> No warrants necessary.<eos> - What about interrogating your own security officers?<eos> - As I said... we are not responsible for this.<eos> - Well, that's quite a bet you're placing.<eos> - It's his chips in the pot.<eos> We have collected various supporters of General Raja's cause.<eos> Also employees of the restaurant.<eos> I am confident one of them... will be able to tell us who has taken your senator.

It's Greeley and his wife.<eos> It's a love letter he wrote her.<eos> My god, it's beautiful.<eos> I don't understand how a guy like this can turn into that monster.<eos> Spirits like Greeley are,uh... Like wounded animals.<eos> Lost.<eos> In so much pain, that they lash out.<eos> Why?<eos> Why are they here?<eos> Well, there's some part of them that... That's keeping them here.
That's out of the question as we talked about before.<eos> - Hello?<eos> What an idiot! - What's going on?<eos> That woman from the town hall says they're issuing a press statement.<eos> How are the boys?<eos> They don't know anything.<eos> I took them to school and tried to be normal.<eos> - What about their teacher?<eos> - I told her.<eos> She promised to keep an eye on them.
-And if I'm not the man for that--<eos> -No, Bullit, buck up.<eos> -You wanna marry my mom, right?<eos> -Of course.<eos> -And you wanna be my stepdad.<eos> -And play Ping-Pong till I'm gray. Let's go.<eos> Then we need to make a plan.<eos> I want nothing less than the most spectacular Valentine's date ever.<eos> Is one of those planes yours?<eos> Two of them.
Does that add up ?<eos> It's so easy for us to go from hunter to hunted.<eos> That is why you drink, and resist the kill.<eos> Giving in to bloodlust, it's many a young one's undoing.<eos> You drink what you need, not all you can.<eos> You took sick in the woods, saw a wolf.<eos> Go home and sleep.<eos> People are so fragile.<eos> Easily manipulated and easily broken.<eos> Sometimes our power over them can be so intoxicating.
Don't be stupid, Ed Mc Mahon don't call.<eos> He'd come to the house.<eos> Promise me you won't answer this.<eos> - Baby, I...<eos> - promise me.<eos> All right, all right. Ow.<eos> We can do this.<eos> People do it all the time.<eos> Oh, they do ?<eos> They move into dead people's houses, steal all their stuff, and pretend to be them ?
Yes, I can, 'cause...<eos> Garcia, do you have anything for me?<eos> Well, he told me to look for anything unusual, And it's all usual.<eos> Minor break-Ins, apartment burglaries, Televisions, stereos, car thefts, and smash and grabs.<eos> Common stuff in the world of burgling.<eos> Nothing a guy lost in the streets Might use for survival?<eos> No, nothing reported. It...<eos> like I said, it's all petty.<eos> There's a... Some vandalism at construction sites.<eos> Communications radio missing from one of them. Wait...
Seth, I'm so sorry you had to overhear that.<eos> No, it's all right.<eos> I mean it's true.<eos> What I was going to say is, I think what you made is really good.<eos> Yeah, there's no coherent theme.<eos> Most of the shots are too wide and the Dogma thing has been done to death.<eos> But you know, I get that you wanted me to find something that I'm passionate about, the way you're passionate about the environment.<eos> But you love movies.<eos> I do.<eos> I love going to them and then telling people what's wrong with them.
But everything in my book happens to be true.<eos> Oh, it's true?<eos> It's true that you're a farm boy from Aerelon.<eos> Yes, it is, as a matter of fact.<eos> I was born and raised on a dairy outside the town of Cuttlesbreath Wash on Aerelon.<eos> Why do I have such a hard time picturing you milking cows and shoveling manure?<eos> Lack of imagination.<eos> Or maybe that your little tale is manure.<eos> I've known people from Aerelon.<eos> You don't sound anything like them.
The truth.<eos> Kind of overrated, I guess.<eos> You know, when I was 9, maybe 10, my grandfather,<eos> he would wave me over.<eos> And he'd do this all the time.<eos> And then he'd say,<eos> "Lee, be a good boy.<eos> "Just don't be too good. "<eos> Everybody has demons.<eos> Them, Baltar, you, me.
She drags her feet.<eos> You're catching on.<eos> And the rest?<eos> What's all this?<eos> My demons.<eos> I borrow things.<eos> My parents disappeared when I was 9 years old.<eos> They were kidnapped.<eos> Murdered for...<eos> For the money they had on them, which wasn't enough.
Some overlaid with blood.<eos> You okay?<eos> - Phthirus pubis.<eos> - Yeah, crabs.<eos> I am buying Lindsey a chastity belt.<eos> There's a hole in the metal to let the urine pass.<eos> So theoretically, she could still get them.<eos> You are so creepy sometimes.<eos> You know, the incidence of STDs in monogamous couples is slim.<eos> Unless one someone arrives at the party with them.
For real.<eos> Okay, Spencer, can you squeeze my hand?<eos> Come on, Spencer, try to squeeze my hand.<eos> - There you go.<eos> Good job. - Core temp is 94.<eos> - Nice work.<eos> ICU ready for him?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Is he gonna lose the frostbitten toes?<eos> - Three of them don't look salvageable.
Damn, I know a lot of big words.<eos> Joy, that's a terrible reason to have a baby.<eos> A terrible reason?<eos> Darnell, the reason I had my first child was a broken condom.<eos> The reason I had my second one was because we were standing up, you had a cramp in your leg, prohibiting you from making a timely exit.<eos> Staying out of jail is the best reason I've ever had.<eos> - Now give me that thing, and let's do this.<eos> - No, no, no. Stop pulling on me.<eos> What if the worst-case scenario happens, and you go to prison?<eos> Then I'll be taking care of three kids who miss their mama, and that's not fair to them or to me.
- Good.<eos> Because as far as friends and family are concerned, it's your life.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You are the new regional manager for Prima-tech paper.<eos> Nice cover. Sorry do make a liar out of you, but it's part and parcel of what we do.<eos> Nobody outside the organization knows.<eos> They can't know.<eos> People are fragile.<eos> Like teacups.<eos> All around them, the world is changing and they -- simply don't want to deal with it.
Luke, it sucks to be betrayed by somebody that you love, but then to find out about it in front of everybody is really humiliating.<eos> You need to be nice to her. Whoa.<eos> Who says I'm not being nice?<eos> However nice you're being, it's not enough.<eos> You've got to let her know that you're there for her and that you're nothing like her ex-boyfriend. Noted.<eos> But for the record, Nathan's nothing like her ex-boyfriend, either.<eos> Noted.<eos> I heard you got expelled. I'm sorry.<eos> My parents are flying me first-class to meet them on vacation.<eos> I finally get to spend some time with them.
Really?<eos> Well, maybe this'll jog your memory.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> That's the douche bag in the cigarette suit.<eos> Seems like you two were close.<eos> You got a really great job here, damon.<eos> Great location, hip clientele.<eos> Being the manager, I'm sure you make a good buck.<eos> Yeah, I do all right.<eos> Uh, so someone protesting outside, telling your customers that smoking is bad for them it would probably hurt your bottom line, right?
Tomorrow I'm gonna let the town decide what to do with you.<eos> We can't do that, Gray.<eos> The hell we can't. People need to know what we're up against.<eos> - Not like this.<eos> - They're gonna find out eventually.<eos> Yeah, they will, and by then, the worst of it will be over.<eos> But food's not enough.<eos> You said it yourself, without some x factor, we don't make it through the winter. Well, this is it.<eos> People need faith just as much as they need food.<eos> And what the hell do we do with them?
So you think you could make elmo work for a week?<eos> Or maybe longer.<eos> Oh, isn't it great?<eos> Think of all we'll get done this week, being back in the same time zone. Oh.<eos> And drinks after work, just like old times.<eos> Well, at least one part of my life will be productive.<eos> I can't get anythingone at the house.<eos> It's like the guys thought i was joking when i hired them.<eos> Well, marin, you're not exactly a taskmaster.<eos> You've had me making burgers for them every day.
Now, you shouldn't...<eos> You really had no right to do that.<eos> Hold on. Don't come in here telling us what rights we do or don't have, Gary.<eos> Now, I understand how you feel...<eos> No, I don't think you do understand, Eppes.<eos> I don't think understand how I feel.<eos> I don't think you know what it's like to living it in the streets, the way we do.<eos> And back then, it was a war.<eos> Cops were dying every day, trying to take back this city.<eos> And Everett was one of them.
Carson and jai... and the guy with the glasses.<eos> - Who cooks a fish.<eos> - Right.<eos> Shawn, you know what your real problem is?<eos> You got yourself another case, and, as usual, you're short-sighted.<eos> You think it's all impressive, Cause you see a couple of nude guys in a field,<eos> You put a fix on 'em here.<eos> Well, it's not enough.<eos> This is what we know-<eos> Both these guys are trying to impress someone, Which means a woman was involved, And that same woman was with them in the field.

I just don't know yet.
He would never lie about somethin' like that.<eos> - You're so sure?<eos> - I choose to believe him.<eos> - I choose to have faith in the people I love.<eos> - You love Dale? Oh.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> Who do you want me to love, Wayne?<eos> You want me to love our neighbors?<eos> Your boss?<eos> All the lovely people who come into my life, call me Cherien. You want me to love them?
I think you like Scott as a loser with no money and no girls, and now he's got more money than you, and a younger girl, and you're sort of threatened.<eos> - Threatened?<eos> - Yes, threatened.<eos> And it's really immature, Ari.<eos> It's immature that I don't like my adult friends speaking to my wife like that?<eos> Well, obviously you do, and he does, so why don't we see how Scott likes it when I start drooling over the future Mrs. Siegal's soon-to-be-jewish ass?<eos> Don't look defeated already, Drama.<eos> It's not about Liddell.<eos> It's about the delinquents.<eos> I don't wanna make eye contact with any of them.
- Thank you.<eos> - You are most welcome, and should you ever reconsider your desire for a husband...<eos> All right, I'll check the inn, you check the tavern.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm looking for three individuals who recently arrived.<eos> I've heard they are voracious eaters and drinkers, and, apparently, they've been quite vocal about their recent successes against the Wraith.<eos> These people you're looking for... they're either very brave, or very stupid.<eos> How so?<eos> Well, if word of their bragging got back to the Wraith, it could be very bad for them.
The fact that Ronon and his buddies aren't here is a good sign.<eos> Not really.<eos> Ronon's buddies are the reason we're here, they set us up.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I ran into them while I was trying to esc...<eos> While I was effecting a strategic retreat.<eos> They stunned me.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> It's pretty hard to misinterpret something like that.<eos> - Was Ronon with them?
The Replicators are not destroying this City, not if I have anything to say about it.<eos> Maybe Rodney's right.<eos> Maybe what Davos can see is only a probable future.<eos> Well, his track record's pretty good, so I'd have to say it's highly probable.<eos> Which means it's going to be hard to avoid.<eos> For all we know, 9 out of 10 courses of action are gonna lead to the same fate.<eos> Now, unfortunately, the vision I saw had no context to it.<eos> We have no way of knowing why the Replicators were attacking.<eos> Isn't it obvious?<eos> We're contemplating joining forces with the Wraith against them.
Yeah, and there'll probably be a run, especially when the zombies come out. Seth. Ryan.<eos> Look, guys, we'll be fine.<eos> Just stay here, lock the doors and don't open them.<eos> Summer, Pancakes needs you right now.<eos> Be careful.<eos> 'Kay, come back soon.<eos> Okay.<eos> Don't you think the boys were acting weird ?<eos> The shifty looks, finishing each other's sentences like they're composing a lie on the spot ? Yes.<eos> Totally normal for them.
On the slim chance that you might be the one who saves us all from the abyss.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> These disasters I see don't just spontaneously happen.<eos> There's a chain of events leading up to each one.<eos> Where do I come in?<eos> By the time I see what's going to happen, my opportunity to break the chain has already passed.<eos> But not for me.<eos> You are only hope.<eos> Futile as it may be.<eos> It's also the only hope your friends have to survive the darkness that's written on them.
And if you ever... come in my office again, you'll not only never see the cash, you'll never see another sunrise.<eos> Are we gonna keep crying about money you've already got coming to you?<eos> - Or do you want to make some more?<eos> - I'm listening.<eos> Ever been to Mexico?<eos> We give this thing to the press, the government's gonna discredit it, just like they did with the tape we made.<eos> Okay.<eos> So what do we do with it?<eos> Dad said there are still people in the administration that he was working with.<eos> If we give the tape to them, they'll finally have the smoking gun they need to bring Caroline Reynolds down.
Imagine if you're petrified.<eos> How'd you find me?<eos> Cammie had these in her wallet.<eos> We tracked you from the birth certificate.<eos> She's a cutie.<eos> What's her name?<eos> Fin.<eos> After cammie's grandmother.<eos> But her adoptive parents call her annabelle.<eos> She kept in touch with them?
So, I'M...guess I'm just going to go ahead and keep the showerhead for myself.<eos> - You're letting it all go?<eos> - I am.<eos> - Even the dome house?<eos> - Even the dome house.<eos> Even though we lost all our money?<eos> Don't care.<eos> - That's very big of you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Especially considering we had to borrow money from your parents and spend every thanksgiving with them until we paid it off.
- Yeah. - Yeah.<eos> And here's a chance Mrs Dobson for Reggie to forgive the man and put the past to rest.<eos> - Mrs. Dobson?<eos> Well like I said ma'am, I can understand you're being weary. - But you know Reggie is an inspiration.<eos> - Yes, he is.<eos> If he does this show, millions of people will hear a story.<eos> You figure he'll stop being inspirational unless he goes on tv?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Of course not, but... - Don't you think the more people...<eos> - Miss Mcdeere, please forgive me for interrupting you, but you know I wasn't born yesterday. And you know you ain't putting Reggie on your tv show to inspire folks. You're putting him on to dance for them.
Roger, you brought over 50 yourself.<eos> We've done our part.<eos> It's time for somebody else to share the burden.<eos> - Now, these FEMA camps...<eos> - Those FEMA camps are jungles.<eos> Putting anybody out on those streets is a death sentence.<eos> You've been out there. You know that.<eos> Look, it comes down to ressources.<eos> All right? And people of Jericho have to come first.<eos> It's 100 of them or 100 of us.
This hasn't got anything to do with that IRA bomb going off, is it?<eos> It hasn't been confirmed that the IRA were responsible for that explosion.<eos> Anyway.<eos> Better late than never, Mr Miller.<eos> Frank, please.<eos> If you wanna search the place, help yourself.<eos> Only, maybe don't let on it was me who called you.<eos> It's mostly Irish fellas working for me here.<eos> I don't want 'em to get the wrong end of the stick.<eos> I rely on them a lot.
I hate you!<eos> Long story short... Jeff's dog ended up as ring bearer.<eos> And the irony is that after the ceremony, that dog peed on everything.<eos> And nobody said boo.<eos> Why are all these people here?<eos> There's too many people on this earth.<eos> We need a new plague.<eos> Who are all these people?<eos> You know what?<eos> I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers. No way.
-Hey.<eos> -Where's Tom?<eos> Relang. Celebrating.<eos> 'Cause lately...<eos> Where is he?<eos> -What happened?<eos> -Do you know where he is?<eos> What happened?<eos> Three American soldiers were ambushed in their truck on a road in Paktika, Afghanistan.<eos> -One of them is Mark Jeter.
Right.<eos> Angela, you have to look at this in the larger context of race relations in Los Angeles.<eos> I mean, there's a pervasive history of police abuse...<eos> Rampart, Rodney King.<eos> - so the defendant's claim that the evidence was tampered with has some historical basis.<eos> You're absolutely right, Bob.<eos> And KTDS News has obtained startling new video which may support this assertion.<eos> This is footage from a surveillance camera located at a church across the street from where the SUV crashed.<eos> These are the two L.A.P.D. detectives who shot and killed Thomas Broussard.<eos> One of them holds what appears to be the defendant's gun in his hand the gun that was allegedly found on the floor of the vehicle.
I had to hold Ray back.<eos> He was never the same after that.<eos> Problems at home.<eos> Drinking more, going home less.<eos> Finally, Alice left. Took his boys.<eos> Ray had nothing left to lose.<eos> You're the guy who planted on that rich scumbag killed your partner.<eos> - This isn't about me. - Yeah?<eos> Whatever you say about Ray every partner he ever had would take a bullet for him.<eos> It's because he'd do the same for them.
You inspect your feet, notice anything?<eos> I noticed it hurts.<eos> Look, I've got 30 guys waiting for me to show up...<eos> Sir, I get it.<eos> You're in a hurry.<eos> That makes two of us.<eos> You need to call your guys and tell them you're not coming in.<eos> - Did you choose a face?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> I was hoping I'd see one of them and, I don't know, recognize myself, but I don't recognize any of these women. What if I choose the wrong one?
Good.<eos> At least the prosecutor says it is.<eos> When do you have to testify?<eos> This afternoon.<eos> It's weird.<eos> I've testified in this building maybe a hundred times,but always as a forensic expert,never as a witness to a crime.<eos> Now you just get up there and you tell the truth.<eos> Look,I know it's tough being on the stand, but there's a few things you should remember.<eos> Make eye contact with those jurors.<eos> You're the only eyewitness,and if you can make a connection with them, if they can look you in the eye,they'll understand what you went through.
You think he knew her somehow?<eos> Can you think of a woman in your dad's life he helped through a tough time?<eos> Might be another police officer, I don't know, a prostitute he helped get off the street?<eos> He hasn't dealt with prostitutes since he worked sex crimes.<eos> The unsub wrote, "He was asking to be ripped."<eos> "I just couldn't help myself," and he wanted it."<eos> What if she's mirroring the man who raped her?<eos> Where are the files stored from your sex crime division?<eos> They were housed the same place as homicide.<eos> Most of them were washed away.
Dwight, you ignorant slut.<eos> Depression is a very serious illness.<eos> Over 32,000 people commit suicide every year, according to a 2004 study.<eos> Is that the last year to date it was available?<eos> Yes.<eos> My head is in such pain and turmoil!<eos> Don't do anything rash.<eos> Dwight, where are the warehouse guys?<eos> I didn't...<eos> I didn't think you needed them for this part.
No.<eos> Did they hurt you?<eos> No.<eos> What is all this?<eos> This is where they live.<eos> And the people they took?<eos> - The kids?<eos> - They're all safe.<eos> Safe?<eos> So you're with them now?
Yeah, my mom's waiting for me.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> What is it with the stuffed animals?<eos> She's like three years old?<eos> Nope - it's cause she's a girl.<eos> You know, she's supposed to like that sort of crap.<eos> Did you see them today?<eos> Crying?<eos> Stupid monkeys.<eos> It's like it happened to them, not her.
How's the Fiero?<eos> She's still in triage.<eos> She?<eos> I thought it was your little boy.<eos> Oh, it goes back and forth.<eos> It's sort of a tranny car.<eos> How long have you had her...<eos> slash him?<eos> My brothers handed it down to me when I was 16.<eos> Oh, how nice of them.
What do you want me to say?<eos> It's not me.<eos> What now?<eos> Want me to do a lie-detector test or something?<eos> You just did.<eos> He's telling the truth.<eos> You think I'm wrong?<eos> No.<eos> But he was relieved when you connected her with the rest of the bodies.<eos> He has no feelings about them at all.
Holy crap, Ruben, snap out of it!<eos> What have you done with happy Ruben?<eos> It's weird, you know.<eos> Now that I'm not gay anymore, I'm not gay anymore.<eos> Okay, we're freaks!<eos> But let's make that work for us.<eos> Come on, you guys. I mean, there has to be some way that we can perform together.<eos> We can start with couples.<eos> I'll take the lead.<eos> So, like, we're gonna copy them?
We canvased exhaustively, but no other suspects.<eos> And when Miss Hill came out of the door, she was covered in the victim's blood.<eos> And what did the stab wounds on the victim tell us about the killer?<eos> The angle and the depth of the wounds tell us that the killer was between 5′2″ and 5′4″ tall and weighed approximately 115 to 120 pounds.<eos> –Is Miss Hill this height and weight?<eos> –Yes, Miss Hill is.<eos> –You said you canvased exhaustively.<eos> –Yes.<eos> How about the 650 people who were called to jury duty that day?<eos> We had no cause to focus on them.
Okay.<eos> I had one of your boys in here earlier Tommy Shaw.<eos> He was trying to unload goods Stolen from this string of burglaries.<eos> How is Tommy doing these days?<eos> I don't think I've seen that boy Since his mother's wake back in '05.<eos> You're working on a third strike, Liam.<eos> You might consider quitting while you're ahead.<eos> Keith, we both know my trip down here Wouldn't have been voluntary if you had anything.<eos> Nothing yet, But I'm gonna keep picking off your flunkies.<eos> Eventually, one of them Is gonna trade me 10 years for your name.
Well look, maybe just in case you do think of something or Brady wants to get in touch, please, feel free.<eos> By the way, I got to say, this is quite a collection you got here.<eos> A lot of interesting artifacts.<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> They were my husbands.<eos> I'm just curious, in his collection anywhere, has he got something that's kind of likesobig;<eos> it looks a severed human hand?<eos> Get out now or I'll call the police.<eos> We're raised with our parents' limitations.<eos> They can stumble and fall and take us down with them, but if we're lucky, we also get their love - enough love that the limitations don't matter.
The difference is I have a case.<eos> Talk to my lawyer.<eos> Who's gonna represent you, ma'am?<eos> So can I go home?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> We've not recovere d the murder weapon and until we search the house, you're still a person of interest.<eos> My parents, too?<eos> Yes.<eos> Trust me.<eos> We are looking into them. This is the third murder they've been connected to today.
You know it's interesting... that you two are now the camp's moral police.<eos> I'm curious, Sayid, how long was it before you told everyone on that beach exactly how many people you've tortured in your life?<eos> Do they know about Basra?<eos> And I'm sure the first thing you did when you got here, James, was to gather everyone in a circle and tell them about the man you shot the night before you got on the plane.<eos> So why don't we just skip the part where you two pretend to be righteous?<eos> I'm taking that medication back to Claire, and you're gonna let me.<eos> Because if she doesn't get it, she's gonna die.<eos> And the last thing that either of you need right now is more blood on your hands.<eos> Goodwin, Ethan, there may actually be survivors.<eos> You're one of them, a passenger, you're in shock.
A wonderful husband.<eos> A loving father.<eos> On the street, though, I mean.<eos> From what I know, you were well-liked, John.<eos> Respected across the board, despite the allocution even.<eos> God knows, guys have actually named names For a hell of a lot less than what you were looking at.<eos> The only nega-<eos> When Carmine died and you took over, People felt you changed, Became a little trigger-happy, maybe-<eos> A hothead.<eos> God forbid Any of them would find themselves In that position.
Maybe ten... twelve seconds.<eos> Not a lot of time for our bad guy to get out of here before this place was turned intothe Killing Fields.<eos> It blew once my team closed the door.<eos> So where'd he go?<eos> There's no back door, there's no side rooms.<eos> How does a dirtbag just vanish into thin air?<eos> Gibbs is almost done with the interviews.<eos> What about you?<eos> Just finishing downloading all the folders Yazeed kept on the company servers.<eos> Any of them sound like the voice on the tip-line?
Previously on "Brothers Sisters"...<eos> William and Holly had a daughter.<eos> Oh, god.<eos> You could discover your father has another child and not tell me?<eos> We want to use your sperm to get julia pregnant.<eos> I'll help you, tommy.<eos> Fill out these forms.<eos> And we'll never know which one of them it is?
I get it now, you wanting to find out.<eos> I didn't really understand the impact of rebecca until tonight.<eos> Tommy, if you need to find out, we can.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'm dropping it for good.<eos> But me wanting to find out, it wasn't just about rebecca.<eos> I mean... you're carrying the babies.<eos> My brothers supplied the seeds.<eos> I'm just like this useless bystander.<eos> I just, I thought if I could find out more about them, I'd- - I'd feel more connected, less... out of control.
- I brought you something...<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Yes...<eos> - What?<eos> DECLARATION.<eos> MUTILATED CORPSES.<eos> WOMEN.<eos> PROSTITUTES.<eos> THE SUSPECT CONFESSES TO VIEWING PORN SITES CONTAINING TORTURE AND SADISM.<eos> THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST DETAILING THEM.
I had 2 brothers, but they died of diphtheria when we were children.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It was a long time ago.<eos> Andrei was 4.Sergei was 6.<eos> I was 5.<eos> That must have been terrible.<eos> It was hard on my parents.<eos> It was never really the same after.<eos> How do you mean?<eos> They never smiled again, neither of them, ever...
Ηe drowned in the shame of his report card, wrote golden songs.<eos> Agatha Christie, famous writer.<eos> Can you believe a writer who couldn't read and write as a child?<eos> But why suddenly am I sharing all this with you today, hmm?<eos> To show you that there have been such gems amongst us who have changed the course of the world because they could look at the world differently.<eos> Their thinking was out of the box and not everyone understood them.<eos> They were ridiculed.<eos> But despite that, they persevered, and the world applauded them.<eos> So to these famous misfits we dedicate today's art class.<eos> With them in mind, let's create something different, anything.
What, you guys never got together, compared wrestling moves?<eos> I didn't know him there.<eos> Did you know everyone who went to your college?<eos> You do know why Father McCourt was sent here.<eos> Yeah, I've heard the rumors.<eos> That's all.<eos> Do you base all your investigations on rumors,<eos> Agent Booth?<eos> He has a point, Booth.<eos> You know, St. Agatha's has been a dumping ground for troubled priests for some time, so it's reasonable to suggest that you're one of them.
No, you're the man we gave her to, to look after, to keep safe, a job you haven't done particularly well.<eos> What are you gonna do with her?<eos> Take her someplace far enough to keep her out of harm's way.<eos> I suggest you do the same.<eos> There isn't much time.<eos> Let me say goodbye to her.<eos> Dad.<eos> Claire, are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm just trying to get away from these people.<eos> You're better off going with them.
I care about us.<eos> More than you, I guess.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> You married me, but you love the Army.<eos> Your buddies in Iraq, your buddies on the base... they're all you talk about!<eos> All you care about.<eos> Those men are my brothers!<eos> Where they're at right now you can't even imagine.<eos> They're out there, they're getting shot at, they're getting blown up.<eos> Yeah, I think about them, and I ain't gonna apologize for that.
- Yeah.<eos> Being a genius yourself, you decided to target the Lundys?<eos> It worked great at first.<eos> I was almost even, Victor was up serious cash.<eos> - Then the brothers caught on.<eos> - I'm surprised you're still breathing.<eos> I borrowed 100 K from my dad, started paying them back.<eos> These guys, they were still pissed.<eos> Are you saying the Lundys killed him?<eos> It had to be them.
He must have been a... a prisoner.<eos> He's got a stab wound to his abdomen.<eos> Will you get me my medical kit?<eos> We have to leave him.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> He's one of your people.<eos> He is not Athosian.<eos> But his... his clothes...<eos> I have never seen him before.<eos> Well, he's obviously not one of them, and if I don't suture his wound, he's going to bleed to death.
Why would the Cylons resurrect a machine that by their standards is hopelessly obsolete?<eos> Maybe they didn't resurrect it.<eos> Maybe they're out here all along.<eos> Is there something you wanna tell us?<eos> There are references in our databases, to a force of centurions, called Guardians.<eos> Early models like this, that somehow escaped being scrapped.<eos> What do this Guardians guard?<eos> A hybrid.<eos> An entity that represents the first step in our evolution from pure machines to organic beings.<eos> From them, to us.
Xena, warrior princess.<eos> History is replete with stories of the heroic destruction of serpents.<eos> Perseus and Medusa, St.George and the dragon,<eos> St.Patrick and the snakes of Ireland.<eos> - But these are not merely legends...<eos> - What is this ?<eos> I think their UFO club is based on the teachings of this guy.<eos> And the natural form of these invaders is not human.<eos> They are described in ancient accounts as serpents and dragons.<eos> And man's weapon against them is the sword.
If there was one person who was more respectful of space and boundaries, it's Grissom.<eos> You could at least offer him the same courtesy.<eos> Wait.<eos> Is he okay with us being in here?<eos> He said he'd be in Autopsy, won't be back for hours.<eos> Anyway, they never solved Izzy Delancy's murder.<eos> Two months later, Penny Garden was found dead in her house.<eos> Suspects included her ex-junkie nephew who was living with her, and her drug-dealing neighbor, who was buying prescription meds from her.<eos> Obvious motives-- drugs and money.<eos> Did either of them have any connection to Izzy Delancy?
Well, you never know how someone's going to react<eos> When they're forced into circumstances like these.<eos> If Bobbi's still alive, we just have to hope she's found a safe place for the night.<eos> Just, uh, stay close. It'll keep us warm.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> Why don't you turn off the light, so they can't see us?<eos> It's probably just an animal or something.<eos> Well, something's not good.<eos> Whatever that noise is, it's right behind us.<eos> Footsteps are too light to be them.
You ok?<eos> - I've never seen you look so, um-<eos> - Quiet.<eos> What's up?<eos> Bobbi Baird asked me a question that's sticking with me.<eos> What was it?<eos> She asked me how they could do it. How those men could... hunt and kill people in the woods.<eos> What did you tell her?<eos> That they don't think like we do.<eos> But... the truth is... that we do think like them.
What was it?<eos> She asked me how they could do it. How those men could... hunt and kill people in the woods.<eos> What did you tell her?<eos> That they don't think like we do.<eos> But... the truth is... that we do think like them.<eos> Yeah, we do.<eos> Because it's our job.<eos> We need to know how it feels.<eos> We hunt these people every day.<eos> The question is, how different are we? Us and them?
It means that bald-headed bastard outside the door is my son.<eos> - Come again?<eos> - My son, as in, I'm his father.<eos> - You do speak English?<eos> - You're his...<eos> - How did you get here, to the island?<eos> - Island?<eos> I'm driving down I-10 through Tallahassee, when, bam, somebody slams into the back of my car.<eos> I go right into the divider at 70 miles an hour.<eos> Next thing I know, the paramedics are strapping me to a gurney, stuffing me in an ambulance, and one of them actually smiles at me as he pops the I.V. in my arm.
Since I've met you, I've gotten bigger.<eos> You're the feed bag.<eos> Me?<eos> You're the influence.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> I don't believe that study anyway.<eos> You don't?<eos> Think about it.<eos> Of course fat people have fat friends.<eos> Thin people don't want to hang around with them.
Is there?<eos> Where the hell's that, then?<eos> Poor ferrets.<eos> Not going to be getting much of a lunch. Good lad.<eos> Y-fronts'll help keep the ferrets in.<eos> Presumably, er... this is where that natural animal attraction of yours will come in handy.<eos> We're off.<eos> Wait!<eos> Those two lads from the record shop, yeah?<eos> They came round and said they had this new gear they wanted me to retail for them, yeah?
All I know is their end game is the same as ours, and that's me out of this hellhole.<eos> And once that happens, you and I will disappear... forever.<eos> But I don't wanna involve you in this mess.<eos> - I want to help.<eos> - It's too dangerous.<eos> I don't ask your permission.<eos> I'm telling you.<eos> I can do this on my own, or you can tell me what you know and we can work it through together.<eos> I don't understand everything that's going on, but these brothers are trying to find out what they can about me.<eos> Let's see what we discover about them. Find out what they're all about.
But Bellick?<eos> Can't be trusted.<eos> I can handle Bellick.<eos> He's not in on this.<eos> - Okay, good.<eos> - But Mahone is.<eos> He's about as stable as a three-legged chair and he's coming with us?<eos> No, he just thinks he is.<eos> He needs his meds.<eos> Without them, he'll self destruct.
- And he's not talking.<eos> - He's gonna have to.<eos> - Problem is Jackie loves this guy.<eos> - Wallace got to him.<eos> - So how do we get to him?<eos> I'm gonna bring in Connie Vasquez.<eos> Top child shrink in L.A.<eos> If anyone can turn this kid around, she can.<eos> How is it being back with your parents?<eos> I don't wanna live with them.
Russell was at the playground where I used to live.<eos> I used to ride my bike down there.<eos> He said he knew my parents.<eos> He said they were going on a long trip and they wanted me to stay with him.<eos> It sounded weird at first, but he was so convincing.<eos> It was like he already knew me.<eos> But didn't you start to wonder about things as you got a little older?<eos> Yeah. But Russell always had an explanation.<eos> He told me that my parents came back but they didn't want me anymore.<eos> He even showed me a letter from them that said they never really loved me.
You don't do that to a friend.<eos> When will she speak to him?<eos> She said tomorrow.<eos> "In all vertebrates, including the human being,<eos> "the female sex is dominant<eos> "in an evolutionary and embryological sense."<eos> We should arrange to meet Vando's parents to apologize.<eos> Apologize? Us?<eos> For breaking that asshole's nose?<eos> It's them who should apologize.
I can't find my belt.<eos> It must be up there somewhere.<eos> What? You hid it.<eos> I'll make the real thing.<eos> - You'll let me know when it's ready?<eos> You know, my game has got--<eos> Code six. I have a casualty. He's urgent.<eos> i response, The insurgents unleash a devastating wave Of leds<eos> - and suicide bombers. who got hit?<eos> You got contact with them?
They are the graces, Excellence.<eos> They have names like Kindness, Honour, Constancy, Mercy and Pity.<eos> They are prisoners in the castle.<eos> The figure to the left under the broken hearts is His Majesty's sister, Princess Margaret.<eos> Who is keeping them prisoner?<eos> Danger, Jealousy, Unkindness, Scorn, Disdain, Strangeness, et cetera.<eos> Is the king there?<eos> Which one is the king?<eos> The men represent Youth, Devotion, Loyalty, Pleasure, Gentleness, Liberty.<eos> And, yes, His Majesty is hid amongst them.
Try to sabotage this operation somehow, and the FBI will receive 'a gift.<eos> And in more ', your clothes impregnated the blood of this poor girl.<eos> Are we clear?<eos> My good bad guy.<eos> We know where you live, man.<eos> Nicholas Brocklehurst, Jane.<eos> Nasreen me He says he has something I should know.<eos> They ', prejudice, are the intermediary for Human Rights case Luke Gardner.<eos> The men arrested in the raid Customs, the English mercenaries?<eos> Well, I do not know if it will 'to something, but the Luke's mother recognized one of them.
Can we start over?<eos> As long as it don't begin with you shooting me in the back, yeah.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> - First name's Joe. Can I call you that?<eos> - That's my name.<eos> Mine's Karl.<eos> Joe, how much do you know about the objects, their history?<eos> Not a lot.<eos> First known date of existence is May 4th, 1961, no one really knows how or why they came to be.<eos> What we do know is that people have been fighting over them ever since.

I'm going to take my belt to your behind!<eos> I knew that the girl from the chocolate factory, who was being punished because she liked to sleep around, would not be happy.<eos> Instead, her life would be sadly beautiful.<eos> Life with her would be anguish and fulfillment in one.<eos> And it came to me that she didn't care who used to live here that it was indifferent to her history of those who'd had to leave.<eos> They'd lived here for centuries, but I knew nothing about them, people I now clean up after.<eos> This is the final territorial claim that I must raise here, but it is a claim that I will bring to a satisfactory end.<eos> The history of the problem:<eos> In 1918, under the heading of the right to national self- determination, several insane so- called statesmen reshaped Central Europe.<eos> It is to them that Czechoslovakia owes its existence.
Thanks, Doc.<eos> Hey, Lightnin'.<eos> How 'bout comin' over here and talk to me a minute?<eos> Son, that was some real racing' out there.<eos> How'd you like to become the new face of Dinoco?<eos> But I didn't win.<eos> Lightnin', there's a whole lot more to racing' than just winning'.<eos> He was so rusty, when he drove down the street buzzards used to circle the car!<eos> Thank you, Mr. Tex, but but these Rust-eze guys over there gave me my big break.<eos> I'm gonna stick with them.
Can I look at them?<eos> Sure.<eos> These are really amazing.<eos> Don't get me wrong.<eos> You're a great teacher, but you should be taking pictures.<eos> Thanks.<eos> That's sweet of you to say.<eos> Are these your parents?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Are you close to them?
12 km from the supermarket to here, it'll only take you 10 minutes.<eos> Two Ustashe Fascists and three Spanish anarchists, couldn't you find any Italians3<eos> Italians expect benefits, they're too expensive.<eos> What3<eos> I just don't wanna divvy the cash.<eos> You hope they'll shoot each other3<eos> That's what usually happens.<eos> How naive!<eos> You grew up on books, joints, and revolutions thanks to your daddy's'money.<eos> I raised sheep, I even slept with them at times, but now they call me "sir".
Sit. Roll over!<eos> - Play! - Play dead!<eos> Attaboy, Verne. Save the food. I'll lose the dog.<eos> - Play. - Huh?<eos> You're dropping all the food, man!<eos> - Here, catch.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> Look, food.<eos> Look, people!<eos> Play with them!
I'm giving you an opportunity to handle it.<eos> Or somebody else will.<eos> I'm sorry you've been brought into this.<eos> If the headmaster won't listen to reason, you might want to tie your shoe.<eos> I'm sorry it has to be this way.<eos> It's not something I'm happy about having to be doing.<eos> Have you thought at all about maybe going back to teaching again full-time?<eos> They're concerned about my personal associations, aren't they?<eos> Cambridge boys stick together like glue.<eos> I'm far too democratic in my tastes for them.
Well, same old, same old.<eos> What's up?<eos> Thought you said you guys were gonna grab Rafik Dotson for us.<eos> I did. And we will.<eos> He said we would do it.<eos> Yeah, no, no. We're not here for him.<eos> We're picking us up a Calvin Joy.<eos> You know, you guys are supposed to contact the local officers before you come in here.<eos> Rev, I just did.<eos> I'm gonna go up with them.
- You tell them, Lovelace.<eos> Begone, demon fish.<eos> That's right.<eos> You hightail it back to your mamas.<eos> - How did he do that? - Don't make me come in the water.<eos> I'll come after your sons and daughters.<eos> I'm gonna give you the bad eye.<eos> A whole bunch of them.<eos> They gonna rule the world.<eos> It's gotta be them.
- Tall guy.<eos> - Stretch!<eos> - Amigo!<eos> So you dare come back?<eos> He says he's found aliens and they're taking our fish.<eos> He says that they're coming and we all have to do this.<eos> There be no such thing as aliens!<eos> Mumble, turn around.<eos> It's a disease.<eos> Is that from them?
Gluant's girlfriend at that time was Xania, the international pop star.<eos> They had been having quite a stormy affair.<eos> By the end of regulation time the score was tied and the game went into sudden death.<eos> For a patriotic Frenchman and a true fan like myself it was almost too thrilling to believe.<eos> And then the miracle.<eos> And then, in front of a stadium filled with people Gluant collapsed dead.<eos> A poison dart in his neck.<eos> And the Pink Panther diamond had disappeared.<eos> The newspapers fed on Gluant's murder with a frenzy.<eos> For them, the world had stopped.
And the keys?<eos> Copies of the spares, from the man who built the cells for the Krauts.<eos> I gave him a choice-- a bullet now or a medal after the war.<eos> He was happy to oblige.<eos> - What are you up to?<eos> - I can't let you go without me.<eos> - You're staying here.<eos> - I can't just do nothing.<eos> My job is to free 40 hostages.<eos> Yours is to take care of them.
Looks like it is.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> I feel better now that you guys are here.<eos> Samantha's been here like 36 hours straight.<eos> She said she wouldn't leave the hospital until you woke up.<eos> -Why'd you do that?<eos> -Because. You're my father.<eos> I thought Bill was your father.<eos> I have two fathers.<eos> One of them told me he was gonna live till he was 200.
There's an American quality that the population responds to.<eos> You know, the big cowboy.<eos> America wants their leaders to be really strong.<eos> It doesn't matter if you're dumb sometimes.<eos> If you appear strong, that's all they care about.<eos> American's don't read enough, that's the whole thing.<eos> OK, Cheers!<eos> Such a sweet man.<eos> This is a song that I'm going to dedicate to my friends in Laibach.<eos> And thank them so much for inviting me to do this very historical North American tour.
About that other thing.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> The mother is a massage therapist in Los Angeles.<eos> Well, she's lying.<eos> Grady wasn't that stupid.<eos> Well, he was sending her money.<eos> He probably felt sorry for her.<eos> He was very generous.<eos> I saw the kid. He looks just like him.<eos> You could show me 10 toddlers and I would find similarities between each of them and Grady.
This man is innocent!<eos> He is innocent!<eos> An angel! This is no man!<eos> This is an angel!<eos> Grenouille!<eos> You can't fool me!<eos> Forgive me,<eos> my son.<eos> The people of Grasse awoke to a terrible hangover.<eos> For many of them, the experience was so ghastly, so completely inexplicable and incompatible with their morals that they literally erased it from their memories.
Well, I had a speech, but I ain't got it no more.<eos> Mr. Duffy got it now in his fat little hands.<eos> Don't you, Tiny?<eos> Go ahead, show the people. Hold it up.<eos> Well, since he got it... I'm gonna have to say something else.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Because I got something else to say.<eos> I got a story about a redneck hick.<eos> He's like yourselves, if you please.<eos> Well, this fella, a while back, this hick... started thinking about all the other hicks... what he could do for them.
There's a legend of a man who lives beneath the sea.<eos> He is a fisher of men, the last hope of all those who have been left behind.<eos> Many survivors claim to have felt his gripping hands beneath them, pushing them up to the surface, whispering strength until help could arrive.
I mean I normally don't see cadets who have been kicked out of the academy.<eos> Why?<eos> - You should get a better job, huh?<eos> - Should I?<eos> So, do they all come in here and cry, your cops?<eos> Sometimes they do.<eos> Yes, sure. Sometimes they cry. Yeah.<eos> Use their weapons?<eos> Let me tell you something.<eos> They signed up to use their weapons, most of them, all right? But they watch enough TV so they know they have to weep after they use their weapons.
- Hasn't changed at all.<eos> The one we Light Others needed very greatly just then she was sentenced.<eos> That's a sad story, Boris Ivanovich.<eos> She was the real target. And I was only the bait.<eos> She was the Great One.<eos> The Chalk isn't in Tamerlane's tomb.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Have you been there?<eos> In '41 , Boris had problems and I needed the Chalk.<eos> I arranged with archeologists to organize an expedition and went with them.
You don't hate me, do you, Rose?<eos> No, I don't hate you.<eos> It was the both of us, Irwin.<eos> We drove each other crazy.<eos> And something was missing... like a job.<eos> All right. I just couldn't be one of those schmucks who sold linoleum flooring, who took the train to work every morning and took the train home every night.<eos> It killed me to be one of those schmucks, Rose.<eos> Those schmucks were fathers, Irwin.<eos> Those schmucks were husbands.<eos> You think it was all easy for them?
Like the Maneater?<eos> Secretly they were rivals.<eos> Zhadoba denied his human appearance and put a mask that he wears all the time.<eos> All this to become stronger than the Maneater Why?<eos> Each one of them wanted to be the first one to awake Moranna the Death<eos> Moranna the Death?<eos> Who is she?<eos> She was a terrible and merciless goddess.<eos> Everything she touched, turned to stone.<eos> She wanted to turn all the humans into slaves, her priests would rule them.
None of them are.<eos> They can't.<eos> So much for "No man left behind."<eos> Sir. Come on in.<eos> Look, I've had to make a few other changes.<eos> I'm promoting you to platoon sergeant.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> You bet.<eos> Trouble is, I already told my men I'd see them through this.
You don't need to prove anything.<eos> No, sir.<eos> You're not the best sergeant I've ever had... you're just the best one that's still walking.<eos> Block's a good man.<eos> Yes, sir, he is.<eos> The men know him, he can step right in.<eos> You know, I have actually thought this through.<eos> Platoon sergeant puts you further away from the bullets.<eos> I already gave them my word, sir.<eos> I told them I'd bring them all home to their mothers... which means I already lied to half of them.
That's the way I remember Iggy, now.<eos> I finally came to the conclusion that maybe he was right.<eos> Maybe there's no such thing as heroes.<eos> Maybe there are just people like my dad.<eos> I finally came to understand... why they were so uncomfortable being called heroes.<eos> Heroes are something we create, something we need.<eos> It's a way for us to understand what is almost incomprehensible... how people could sacrifice so much for us.<eos> But for my dad and these men... the risks they took, the wounds they suffered... they did that for their buddies.<eos> They may have fought for their country... but they died for their friends.<eos> For the man in front, for the man beside them.

And here I thought I was like Mr. Joe Punk Rock, and I went down to DC one day to go see SOA and I think the Untouchables.<eos> It was a total hardcore show. I had never been to one before.<eos> I just walked in, I was like, "Oh, my God!<eos> These people are killing each other."<eos> You know, it kind of frightened me but it was kind of fun at the same time.<eos> So I was like, "I wanna be a part of that scene."<eos> But, you know, these guys were all from the DC area.<eos> They all lived in... "Georgetown Punks" is what they called themselves.<eos> Lan MacKaye and his brother Alec and that whole crew, and Henry Warfield before he became Henry Rollins.<eos> You know, I wanted to be just like them.
I'll never forget some LA storm trooper cop walking up to me and saying,<eos> "Did you just call me a motherfucker?"<eos> I'm like, "Oh," I was trembling, because I just know that the guy, cat and mouse, the guy can take me into jail any time he wants, and I was like...<eos> And he's like, you know,<eos> "What's the matter, you a fucking faggot?" I'm like, "No."<eos> I'm like... This is a cop.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Cops would just march in and just shut the show down.<eos> They would literally form a line at the front of the stage,<eos> I remember seeing kids lying on the floor that had already been beaten up so badly they couldn't move, and I could just remember cops standing over them swinging their batons, beating the hell out of them.
- I didn't rat him.<eos> - All right.<eos> I was looking for Pobby and Dingan.<eos> Pobby and Dingan?<eos> Yeah, they're my daughter's friends.<eos> They're imaginary.<eos> Please explain.<eos> My daughter, Kellyanne, has...<eos> Had these imaginary friends.<eos> And I just happened to be looking after them on that day and I forgot about them.
Yeah, well, it's his client.<eos> Oh, come on, get on with it.<eos> If he doesn't know the rules, he shouldn't be here. Jesus.<eos> Overruled.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Nichols.<eos> So,<eos> these imaginary friends, they were pretty real to Kellyanne?<eos> Oh, yeah, totally.<eos> Yeah, she talked to them.<eos> She played with them all the time like they were real people.
Oh, come on, get on with it.<eos> If he doesn't know the rules, he shouldn't be here.

Thank you<eos> I rub it with kelp and jellyfish twice a day Hm<eos> Wow!<eos> Wow!<eos> Please don't eat us!<eos> The thought!<eos> It's okay<eos> I just want to see what feet feel like<eos> Give it!<eos> Can you pick things up with them?
Why?<eos> What happened?<eos> - I got to choose between these 2 boys.<eos> Between these guys?<eos> - Yes, and I can't delay it anymore<eos> Dad wants my marriage to take place this very week.<eos> This very week?<eos> - Yes, choose one of them.<eos> Will you?<eos> Which of them do you like?
Maybe they've come to invite me to a party this time.<eos> No, sir.<eos> No party.. it's some work actually.<eos> Not about a girl, is it?<eos> ls her father bothering you?<eos> Actually, we..<eos> I need the pistol.<eos> Trouble.<eos> - We need some pistols<eos> What'll you do with them?
Who was he?<eos> What was his name?<eos> Say something.<eos> Who were they?<eos> Where did they come from?<eos> Doctor, d'you know who he is?<eos> Stop staring at him.<eos> Actually, I have never seen his types alive.<eos> They always come to the hospital, dead.<eos> Most of them are so brutally killed that they are beyond recognition.
You thrust a gun in his hand.<eos> The bullet from his gun took Ma's life.<eos> From now on, for us, you are no different from this burning pyre.<eos> Sunita..<eos> One doesn't leave a burning pyre behind.<eos> No, my child.<eos> I quit all the bad work, like your mother wanted.<eos> Yes bhai?<eos> Let the boys go.<eos> Do no harm to them.
You can never put it together again.<eos> Makes it bad for all of us...<eos> Just cheapens it.<eos> That's... that's great, honey.<eos> Why don't you go start the grill?<eos> - I will.<eos> - Okay.<eos> So you mentioned most of the guys in your line of work today are... Uh, hacks.<eos> I'm not talking about the guys that really worked hard, like Jay and Fred and Mike.<eos> There weren't nobody like them in the early years.
Not in front of the k-i-d-z.<eos> These little guys love me.<eos> Right, Billy?<eos> Don't make me eat you.<eos> They kid. That's why they're called kids.<eos> I told you, Sid.<eos> You're not qualified to run a camp.<eos> What do qualifications have to do with childcare?<eos> Besides, these kids look up to me.<eos> I'm a role model to them.
Hey, she should come with us.<eos> Are you insane?<eos> No way.<eos> Manny wants me to ask you if you'd like to escape the flood with us.<eos> - I'd rather be road kill.<eos> - That can be arranged.<eos> Funny.<eos> Let me have a little word with my brothers.<eos> Ellie, are you crazy?<eos> We're not going with them.
I'm going.<eos> Bye everybody.<eos> Mummy!<eos> Someone save me please!<eos> Now you're going to say, I saved you. Right.<eos> I could have died, man.<eos> You can't do one thing properly.<eos> Every time I have to forget The goons and save you.<eos> Hey! Hey relax!<eos> I had already taken care of them.
Sweet, huh?<eos> And what do you say to your girlfriend?<eos> I'm the Old Bill, Will, you know?<eos> I've been on the beat, undercover, in a suit, you know, it's the law.<eos> It's, uh, Einstein's law of relativity.<eos> What does that mean, exactly, sir? Relativity?<eos> Well, relatively speaking, um, it means, if me and Sandy here break the law, you know, we're gonna get a decent lawyer. Hmm.<eos> Now these guys who broke in here, they go straight to jail.<eos> "Do not pass Go. "<eos> One law for us, one for them.
Maybe, maybe before you repair the window, you should smash a few more.<eos> That's all I do, you see, in my job, I tidy up.<eos> There's a mess between buildings, and we come in.<eos> Squeeze in bits of green, like dressing.<eos> Like lipstick, like pretty.<eos> Anyway, that's a roundabout way of saying... the shape of your mouth,<eos> I could probably draw it by heart.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> I was thinking, uh, that was a roundabout way of saying you're married, which I know, and I was thinking Bosnian men would say less, but, uh... would want more.<eos> They love to talk, they love talk, believe me, but, uh, talk for them is politics, women for them is not talk.
But the audience is stupid and he knows it.<eos> He manipulates them.<eos> He himself said nothing.<eos> His actress said nothing inflammatory.<eos> He left it to the audience to make their accusations.<eos> All plants paid for by him, of course.<eos> I don't suppose you made a note of those people?<eos> I'm afraid we didn't have enough men tonight.<eos> At the next performance, I want them all arrested.<eos> Every one of them.
All of it is assembled in Juarez and it's all covered with blood. Would you calm down?<eos> If you walk out of here today... you could never get back in here, and you know it.<eos> - For God's sakes, let this thing go!<eos> - I can't.<eos> - You think this is your big story. - My parents are from Mexico.<eos> - You identify with it. - I'm one of them.<eos> Can't you see?<eos> My parents came here as migrant farm workers.<eos> They were killed... so I was adopted.<eos> I only have vague memories of them.
And I swear you'll never again be the team short on character.<eos> We need to find the soul of this team again.<eos> The soul that drove great Eagle players.<eos> Players like Norm Van Brocklin,<eos> Tommy McDonald, Steve Van Buren.<eos> They weren't just out here playing for themselves. They played for a city.<eos> People of Philadelphia have suffered.<eos> You are what they turn to in times like these.<eos> You are what gives them hope.<eos> Let's win one for them.
Display dignity.<eos> Walk with pride.<eos> I'm okay!<eos> Cold!<eos> Cold!<eos> One, two...<eos> Two... Two...<eos> Don't you think it'd be better if we got a little closer?<eos> The distance makes it easier to spot danger.<eos> But it sure makes it harder to play with them.
It's difficult to explain.<eos> You have to look, listen, and smell, all at the same time.<eos> I can do that.<eos> Look, listen, smell.<eos> Try to feel the forest around you.<eos> I don't feel anything.<eos> -Does playing in the meadow.<eos> -How do you know?<eos> I feel it in my hooves.<eos> If there was danger, they'd know to stomp, and I'd run to them.
Hold on for what?<eos> This is as far as you go too.<eos> -Come on, man. I don't--<eos> -Listen to me, Eddie.<eos> -What?<eos> -Listen.<eos> Those guys you were gonna testify against...<eos> -...those cops?<eos> -Yeah?<eos> I was one of them.
You either get over it... or pick up smokin' again.<eos> Go and finish them off.<eos> Take the fuckin' rent-a-cop with you too.<eos> Your cut will be here when you're done.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Have a seat.<eos> There's been a development.<eos> Do any of those men look familiar to you?<eos> Their names?<eos> You ever recall seeing any of them...
Now, these humans don't know who they are and they always appear in the story earlier.<eos> Are there humans with powers that can help you but don't know who they are?<eos> That's a yes!<eos> They've got weird names:<eos> A Symbolist, a Guardian and a Guild.<eos> Ask her if that's right.<eos> You want something.<eos> One of them. Vick.<eos> Mr. Heep.<eos> Mr. Heep is one of them.
-Recharge to 300.<eos> -Charging.<eos> clear!<eos> Resume CPR. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.<eos> MAN ON TV: ...thirty-four degrees.<eos> Forty-nine was our low temperature at the airport.<eos> Gonna be at that or just maybe above that for tonight.<eos> Let me show you why.<eos> Look, the winds are starting...<eos> -...a few of them come back.
I've seen the literature you've been reading.<eos> You've stooped to searching through my desk?<eos> Sir William Dolben told me you'd asked to be shown round the East India Docks.<eos> So, you would use my private concerns for your own political ends.<eos> Yes, exactly that.<eos> The principles of Christianity lead to action as well as meditation.<eos> Allow me to meditate on it before I decide on any action.<eos> Just think about this, Wilber.<eos> The slave trade has 300 MPs in its pocket.<eos> It would be just you against them.
Okay.<eos> Well, first, there are men with guns in there, so I can't guarantee any results.<eos> Agreed?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - All right.<eos> Now, what makes you think that they want to rob your box?<eos> I don't.<eos> Well, why don't you tell me how you would like this to end?<eos> I'd prefer that nobody ever touch my safe deposit box.<eos> Not them, not you, not the authorities.
I see.<eos> Well, then I'm done with it.<eos> You haven't even tasted it yet.<eos> Precisely.<eos> Well, at least let us introduce you to our head vintner. He came up with...<eos> Gentlemen, I don't need to taste your wine nor meet your head vintner to confidently proclaim that this wine is a piece of shit...<eos> A little piece of heaven?<eos> Ken Kennedy, head vintner.<eos> See, we're a family here and our grapes are a part of that family.<eos> And they know that we'd do anything for them.
- You will take care of me and this country.<eos> Where is Jonah Wasswa?<eos> Where is he?<eos> I need my minister.<eos> A minister should be by his president's side.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> And you call yourself my closest adviser.<eos> You see? You see? These loyal soldiers, already they have captured the criminals.<eos> Do not pity them, Nicholas.
I suppose you haven't been back there since?<eos> Well, we can't stand around here talking all day.<eos> No, I won't keep you.<eos> Evening, Amadeo.<eos> Waiting for someone?<eos> I was waiting for you.<eos> Get in.<eos> Am I under arrest?<eos> It's about those city folk...<eos> - You've been with them a lot.
-lt was only two grapes!<eos> I thought no one would notice.<eos> -We've made a mistake!<eos> -A mistake?<eos> You failed. You can never return.<eos> -lt was an accident!<eos> -You cannot return.<eos> The moon will be full in three days.<eos> Your spirit shall forever remain among the humans.<eos> You shall age like them, you shall die like them and all memory of you shall fade in time.
Okay, let's move.<eos> Sir... a man calling himself Tavarov just killed a hostage.<eos> More hostages will be killed unless I turn you over.<eos> - I need a straight answer.<eos> - Please.<eos> Did you order your guards to shoot at the people at your palace?<eos> No.<eos> Let me explain something.<eos> These men are brutal.<eos> We fought against them, 10 years. Suffered their abuses for more than 20.

And that is why we go.<eos> One forgets everything, seeing only the play of the boat with the sea, the play of the sea around the boat, leaving aside everything not essential to that game.<eos> One has to be careful, though, not to go further than necessary to the depths of the game.<eos> And that is the hard part... not going too far.<eos> Donald: "You look out on this wild landscape stretching away as far as the eye can see, streaks of spume blown down the face of these immense waves... and froth-white foam sending a great flurry of spray and heavy water<eos> all over everything.<eos> And it's all tremendously exciting, and a tremendous challenge, of course."<eos> Crowhurst was drifting off the coast of South America, preparing a record of his false journey, film and audiotapes that would be broadcast on his return.<eos> In two months' time, the race route would bring the other sailors around Cape Horn and past him.<eos> At that point, he could slip in beside them, and sail for home.
All right, close your eyes.<eos> What do you see?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Rub them.<eos> Can you see the stars?<eos> Yes.<eos> It was a starry night.<eos> Four men waited impaitently on a small island surrounded by a calm sea.<eos> But that calmness was deceptive.<eos> For at that moment an Indian with a bandaged thigh swam towards them.
You allergic to cats?<eos> I used to be a pilot in the Air Force.<eos> They called me the Hawk.<eos> Yeah, I was hell on earth, but you'd never know it.<eos> Hey, you want a biscotti?<eos> Uh, no thanks.<eos> I don't blame you.<eos> They're addictive. So, uh, you served in Grenada?<eos> Yeah. There's a war that the media ignored, huh?<eos> I guess it wasrt sexy enough for them or whatever.
You, who silenced a muezzin because he interfered with your sleep!<eos> I'd rather fornicate with a pig on a Ramadan Friday!<eos> You incessantly judge my country and religion with smug pretention.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> You... with your cigarettes, your mambo, your tits, in this gang of fanatics!<eos> I told you, but you didn't listen.<eos> My father was a saint of a man.<eos> If he hadn't had that terrible jokari accident, he'd be leading the revolution!<eos> - You're not like those men.<eos> - I'm just like them.
Come again ?<eos> Temporal bilocation.<eos> Fargo !<eos> Somehow the back half of the RV became momentarily isolated from the front.<eos> It's caught in a different time stream.<eos> Where it ended up was a direct result of the Earth rotating beneath it during stasis.<eos> How is that possible ?<eos> That's a good question.<eos> We're auditing all active projects.<eos> But so far, none of them seem related.
-401 (k)?<eos> No.<eos> A pat on the back and a fucking watch, man.<eos> Now, was that worth it?<eos> Well, it depends on the watch.<eos> I mean, if they gave him a Patek Philippe or a Roger Dubuis.... That's not the point, man.<eos> The point is, the guy is dying of ass cancer now.<eos> All messed up.<eos> His kids all messed up on drugs.<eos> One of them is a fucking tranny.
Can you see him?<eos> If you move, he'll shoot you.<eos> Thank you, Private.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Shafiq Rasul.<eos> And, er, What's your date of birth?<eos> 15th April, 1977.<eos> April, okay.<eos> Who were you travelling with to Pakistan?<eos> I was with my friends, one of them was getting married.
I understand it. But that's not the final answer.<eos> - Wow, you think you understand it?<eos> It's like this see...<eos> Sometimes things look like they don't have any order, and then, from a different level, you realize that it does have order.<eos> It's like climbing a mountain.<eos> Look around, you see trees and rocks and bushes, pressing around you. And then you get above the tree line, you see everything you just went through and it all like comes together. You know, you see that it has a shape, after all.<eos> Sometimes it takes a long time to get high enough to see it, but it's there, it's...<eos> It's all about space and time and how it... How they change the rules sometimes.<eos> Makes perfect sense to me.<eos> It's like... two mirrors. Moving through space. There's a single atom moving between them.
Something forthose moments in which weakness overcomes you.<eos> Vitamins.<eos> Vitamins, totally pure.<eos> You take two in the morning, and one with dinner. When you finish the bottle, you'll feel brand new.<eos> Don't you have a smaller bill?<eos> The next thing is to stay in the street, remain in the street.<eos> Where he actually lived for three or four days, but we can't tell exactly.<eos> It is not easy to get away from a scheme, from any scheme.<eos> That is not easy when one struggles against that scheme alone.<eos> Therefore, maybe he reaches the conclusion that he should find the solution in others. So he begins to make appointments with acquaintances, not friends, with the alleged objective to see how they are and exchange courtesies but, while talking to them, with the secret intention to get ideas, help, a clue.
Now let us see just how far we can go to have the chair.<eos> Do you see anything?<eos> Have you everwondered why people are bad?<eos> Why does anyone do something bad at a certain moment?<eos> Do you know why?<eos> Because of talk behind one's back.<eos> That's why.<eos> When someone does something bad, it takes a second for people to talk behind one's back, to mutter.<eos> We exist because of those comments.<eos> We come from them.
I got rounds flying all over the place.<eos> I've got guns all over the place.<eos> Now back off. lt's getting dark out.<eos> Chief, you got to let us in.<eos> My whole battalion's in here, Chief.<eos> -There's still guys in there.<eos> -l know it, boys. Not tonight.<eos> Tomorrow's another day.<eos> It'll be dark in a half an hour, man!<eos> God bless their souls, but I'm not letting you join them!
Yes...<eos> We seek a new beginning...<eos> Be still.<eos> My son!<eos> Be still.<eos> Back to the village.<eos> I ask you not to speak of what you saw in the forest today.<eos> You are troubled.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Those people in the forest, what did you see on them?
I can't go.<eos> Not now...<eos> People of the banner of the sun do not fear.<eos> Rejoice!<eos> Kukulkan has drunk his fill of blood.<eos> We have sated his thirst.<eos> Great god. Show us that you are pleased.<eos> Let your light return upon us.<eos> What of these captives?<eos> Dispose of them.
- Don't go.<eos> - It's just sometimes I said it to myself.<eos> Please don't go.<eos> Come here.<eos> I'll call you from Moscow.<eos> Tell me about butterflies.<eos> Do you know that monarch butterflies have a compass in their head that uses the sun to tell them where they are going?<eos> And that Costa Rica has more butterflies than any country on Earth?<eos> No, I had no idea.<eos> And butterflies have eyes that allow them to see what's happening in front and behind them at the same time.
- Where the hell is Paul?<eos> I want an answer!<eos> He's with the people from the village.<eos> He's helping them look for the child.<eos> What?<eos> But she's here, he knows she's here.<eos> He's pretending to look.<eos> It was his idea.<eos> I'm sure he's fine.<eos> - Fine? With them?
PATH train service to Jersey City and Hoboken is still suspended.<eos> Stay tuned for all updates.<eos> Coming up after the break, four patients go missing from St. Vincent's critical ward.<eos> Rough night, huh?<eos> I'm Matthew.<eos> Had a few?<eos> Call 911.<eos> Stay out!<eos> Let me in!<eos> No way, man. How do I know you're not one of them?
Did you contact the pilot?<eos> No, nobody said anything.<eos> We can't get through to the cockpit.<eos> We can't get through.<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Sir, okay. Okay, sir.<eos> We're United flight 93.<eos> We've been hijacked.<eos> There's three men with knives.<eos> One of them has a bomb strapped around his waist.
- Either. But how?<eos> My mom's company transferred her here to Albuquerque.<eos> I can't believe you live here.<eos> I looked for you at the lodge on New Year's Day, but...<eos> - I know. We had to leave first thing.<eos> - Why are you whispering?<eos> What? Oh...<eos> Well, my friends know about the snowboarding.<eos> I haven't quite told them about the singing thing. - Hey, what's up, Troy?<eos> - Hey, what's up. - Too much for them to handle?
Shots fired. West tower. Nomad...<eos> All right, hold on.<eos> Just lay still for a minute.<eos> Let me figure out... What the fuck...<eos> Get out of the way.<eos> Fuck.<eos> You ain't gonna believe this shit.<eos> Both these motherfuckers is feds.<eos> No.<eos> One of them is not.
But I'm driving now...<eos> Ok, Go ahead and work.<eos> I'II call again.<eos> May god be with you AII the best.<eos> He's such a nuisance...<eos> Nothing but threats.<eos> Go to OHM vaults near Bandra national college.<eos> - Get in.<eos> The distance between these two specimens .... Isn't just the 4 inch seat between them.<eos> There's a much greater distance between them.
As you wish sir.<eos> We welcome you and you're our proud customer. - Thank you.<eos> You're most welcome, anytime.<eos> If anything, please let us know...<eos> My future cannot be in the hands of an insane cabbie...<eos> My future has to be in my own hands...<eos> You've been my father's Iawyerfor 30 years...<eos> You must have his signature on thousands of documents...<eos> He has signed he last page of each of these documents...<eos> pull out the Iast signed page of one of them...
Yeah, man, Antoine said he saw you on the idiot box or something.<eos> - Bad outfit, by the way. - Oh, yeah.<eos> Do you-- do you know him?<eos> Yeah, he comes in here sometimes.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - I'm good. How are you?<eos> Yeah, I'm good.<eos> Listen, we have to talk.<eos> After I started using my powers to help people, these two brothers in suits showed up.<eos> And since I wouldn't join them, they're trying to destroy me.
Here he comes.<eos> Hey Dad.<eos> You always miss everything.<eos> What?<eos> Your daughter has to tell you something.<eos> What's up?<eos> Oome on, I saw the test lying in your bathroom.<eos> I always had the little one in tow.<eos> I hated that.<eos> My friends never had their brothers and sisters with them.
How do you feel? I feel like an idiot.<eos> Wasting time ... with a bunch of amateurs putting my business at stake.<eos> Now you know how your customers feel when traveling with your airline. - You're ...<eos> - Edgar, please ... sit and listen to me one minute.<eos> I will make it worthwhile. I promise.<eos> Thank you. Now visualize that. I am a customer of Trans USA Airlines with the passage at hand.<eos> My passage indicates my flight will leave at 14h.<eos> I leave the company at 11 h. .. to get to the airport with time enough to check in.<eos> I'm at the airport but can not even see the check in counter ... it is crowded with passengers last minute, or waiting in line ... who are trying to get tickets at half the price I paid. And you know what?<eos> Your people are paying attention to them and not me.
Our nation was founded on judeocristianos values.<eos> We know that when the things they began to change it was let pray in the schools, and ah... the schools they began to come down.<eos> And now we say:<eos> "Delay a minute, where it is my country ".<eos> Let us create firmly that there are two types of people in the world.<eos> Those that they love Jesus and those that no.<eos> And I want that my children grow saying: " Sabes what?<eos> "To be Christian he is something good".<eos> ... Matthew Spalding, our guest.<eos> Tomorrow, Glenn Thomas he will give a direct testimony us of marines involved Christians in the Operation Freedom for Iraq of its book God Saw Them Through.
I acted like it was okay when your boyfriend would sneak into my room.<eos> Stop!<eos> Don't you go there!<eos> Stop that.<eos> I'm sorry about that.<eos> How many times do we have to talk about that?<eos> Black people, do me a favor.<eos> Have a life goal. Do something with your lives.<eos> Just strive, you know, for something other than The Maury Povich Show.<eos> Yeah. That's where they do the DNA testing where they bring, like, five to 10 different men on to find out which one of them is father of your child.
I'm sorry about that.<eos> How many times do we have to talk about that?<eos> Black people, do me a favor.<eos> Have a life goal. Do something with your lives.<eos> Just strive, you know, for something other than The Maury Povich Show.<eos> Yeah. That's where they do the DNA testing where they bring, like, five to 10 different men on to find out which one of them is father of your child.<eos> I need for y'all to think outside the box just a little bit.<eos> This motherfucker.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now, when you find out that none of them is the father of your child you take off running backstage.
You'll see!<eos> It's in her blood!<eos> No, I can't resist!<eos> " Chiquita Madame de la Martinique "<eos> " Chiquita Madame de la Martinique "<eos> " Tell me why you're so ironic "<eos> " Chiquita madame de la Martinique "<eos> " Men smile at you to do their bidding "<eos> " The men round here dance really well "<eos> " But a lot of them want to kiss me, too "
- The ones who know.<eos> May the sign of the cross protect you from the demons.<eos> That demons get out your way.<eos> May the sign of the cross protect you from the demons.<eos> Be very careful.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> That demons get out your way.<eos> May the sign of the cross protect you from the demons.<eos> May the sign of the cross protect you from the demons.<eos> - So what should we do about them?
- They didn't give you the option...<eos> - They didn't give you an option to buy.<eos> They said: "Thank you for leasing the car.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> That's it. " "Turn it in by such and such a date, or you're going to be held liable. "<eos> GM had very quietly gone about taking cars back, without anybody saying very much other than some of the drivers that complained having their cars taken away but never in a big, organized fashion.<eos> They had no choice but to turn them in or face legal consequences of stealing a car.<eos> To my knowledge all the cars were turned in because people had too much to lose.<eos> To this day, the automakers have fought anyone understanding how much demand there was, and how much demand that there is.<eos> So we decided we were going to fight them in whatever way we could, and we became organized.
To live your life without expectation... without the need for specific results... that is freedom.<eos> Remember.<eos> You are constantly in the act of creating yourself.<eos> You are, in every moment, deciding who and what you are.<eos> You decide this largely through the choices you make... regarding who and what you feel passionate about.<eos> Gotta tell ya, I'm a little worried about what people might say... when I tell 'em I'm having a conversation with you.<eos> Worry is the activity of a mind... that does not understand its connection with me.<eos> Do you remember the question - what would love do now?<eos> - Answer that question, Neale... and I will be there, always, in all ways.<eos> Sufferinghas nothing to do with events... but with one's reaction to them.
Seriously, I'm not joking.<eos> Seriously.<eos> Are you gonna shit?<eos> Wouldn't you feel better?<eos> We have a whole wardrobe van.<eos> I don't want a new wardrobe.<eos> I just wanna not shit my pants.<eos> So, the boys think they're arriving in a limo for a photo shoot, but little do they know, we have a shitload of bees we're going to put through the sun roof.<eos> And we rigged the locks so they can't get out.<eos> And when they do get out, we got a couple of marbles for them.
That's vague.<eos> It means nothing.<eos> Tarot isn't the best way to get a clear answer.<eos> We have something better.<eos> Don't we?<eos> Kris?<eos> - Summon ghosts.<eos> - Ouija won't help. They're already here.<eos> - Wow!<eos> - Ouija's a way to communicate with them.
All right, just don't look at it.<eos> Is he alive?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I think my leg is broken.<eos> Can you feel your toes?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Don't worry about me.<eos> Worry about them.
No, let's walk.<eos> Walking is good for health. It might be just what you need, Ohsugi.<eos> So that's Suribachi.<eos> You unpatriotic... no-good peasants!<eos> Hey, stop it!<eos> Stand up!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> These soldiers... were conspiring with unpatriotic words, sir.<eos> I see.<eos> And, Captain, do you have such an excess of soldiers... that you could put two of them out of commission?
It means that we have to leave behind our identity... for a few moments... and begin to speculate who we could be.<eos> To change means modifying our behavior enough... so that it's permanent.<eos> ** [ Ends ] Our experiences color what we know.<eos> So there is no completely objective appraisal of anything.<eos> Because our appraisal of everything... has to do with our previous experiences... and our emotions.<eos> Everything has an emotional weighting to it.<eos> We've gone from emotions being these spiritual... immaterial things to things- they're not even things- to actual molecules with molecular weights... and peptides with sequences and structures.<eos> Science knows now that the hypothalamus makes neuropeptides... and those neuropeptides are strong chemicals.<eos> Well here's the story of the peptide and the cell.<eos> The peptides find the receptors... and dock onto them and stay attached.
Absolutely not.<eos> The problem that I have with right and wrong and those categories... is not that I want a free-for-all... but that right and wrong doesn't go nearly far enough.<eos> [ Woman ] They have never sinned.<eos> They have never wrong<eos> - Wronged yes.<eos> Immoral confrontations with society.<eos> But that's their adversity.<eos> That's why they're here.<eos> To wrong to learn to search. And use the wisdom of that to create yet greater dreams.<eos> The records are here and I'm going to have to deal with them.
Base, headed to the men's room.<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> ( phone beeps ) Yes?<eos> GUARD: Mr. Rossler?<eos> We may have a situation.<eos> What kind of situation?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Please remain in your office until you get the all clear.<eos> The guards look suspicious.<eos> One of them has an automatic weapon.
On second thought...<eos> I'm going with her.<eos> Michelle!<eos> Michelle!<eos> Did Jepson brief you on what's happening?<eos> Said there was a car bombing. Two former CTU agents were hit.<eos> Yeah, their names are Michelle Dessler and Tony Almeida.<eos> - You knew them?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We're data-mining for a connection between them and President Palmer.
Chloe, please.<eos> Don't shut down on me now.<eos> I'm upset about everything that's happening too, but you know how things work around here.<eos> We do not quit until it's over.<eos> You're not helping her.<eos> You're just making things worse.<eos> I am sure that you are qualified to help someone through this kind of distress over an extended period of time, but you see, we do not have an extended period of time.<eos> So if you don't mind stepping aside so I can do my job, I would appreciate it.<eos> Believe it or not, Jack, you don't have to be qualified to help people.<eos> You just have to be there for them.
Do you not know that expression, Michael?<eos> I thought we were on the same page here.<eos> That's a nice try, Pop, but in your old computer, I found a Nellie.<eos> You're trying to tell me that is not my sister?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's perfectly innocent.<eos> She's my prostitute.<eos> I'm a red-blooded man.<eos> I have certain needs that your mom can't satisfy.<eos> But sex wasn't one of them.
- She's right behind you.<eos> - I know.<eos> This is not a debate.<eos> This child will not be raised by the cylon, and I cannot risk cylon agents getting their hands on it.<eos> What I need from you, Doctor, is your help.<eos> Fine. I don't like it, but have it your way.<eos> - I need it immediately.<eos> - We'll have to find somebody suitable.<eos> I'll have to work up a list of names.<eos> Each of them is capable. Each of them is anonymous.
Works for our president.<eos> Maybe it just isn't funny.<eos> I hate cats.<eos> - I beg your pardon?<eos> - Can't stand 'em.<eos> Barry belonged to my third husband.<eos> When he tried to pick me up at a bar, his toupee was slipping... and he told me hews a breast inspector.<eos> - And you married him?<eos> - You can see why I prefer the cat.<eos> Husbands come and go, and when they go, their friends go with them.
And then stab him through the heart with a pen.<eos> Yeah, ma?<eos> Tommy, there's a drug problem on the Hill, and I think it's time we did something about it.<eos> - Well, some of the gals down at Patsy's were talking after that incident today on Tilden.<eos> They want to have a meeting, and I said you would talk to them.<eos> About what?<eos> About the drug problem on the Hill, Tommy.<eos> Ma, you understand who controls most of the drugs on the Hill, don't you?<eos> You and I both know it's those dreadful orientals.<eos> That fellow this morning, he was one of them.
And, one of her clients made an offer, but the financing fell through.<eos> A week later the house was taken off the market.<eos> Why didn't you tell the police that you were planning to move six months ago?<eos> I didn't think it was important.<eos> I mean, I thought about moving to Arizona to be closer to my sister, but Charlie was so upset about it.<eos> He refused to even look for his own place.<eos> I felt awful.<eos> I just didn't want to push it.<eos> Danielle frequently brought perspective buyers to the house.<eos> She was killed not long after preparing an offer for one of them.
Which means they were all in on faking their alibi<eos> The loop tape makes it look like they were all sitting in detention, quietly studying<eos> Not pushing Trevor Dawson off the roof<eos> Looks like those kids in detention cooperated to make the fake the security tape<eos> Conspiracy to keep anyone from seeing the hours before Trevor Dawson died<eos> Why would those kids wanna kill Trevor?<eos> Well kids in detention are usually troubled types<eos> Who knows what's brewin' in the hormone addled brain<eos> Take a look at their files<eos> One of them has a record
What about the window ?<eos> We can jump.<eos> Ah, good job.<eos> The security deadbolts are still engaged and without power, I can't get it open.<eos> Let's break it.<eos> It's reinforced glass.<eos> Shatter-resistant and soundproof.<eos> I figured it would keep people out, not us in.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> We know they're in there, smith, and we're not leaving without them.
I'd not presumed to suppose in that regard, Mr. Hearst, one way or another.<eos> Was the sheriff's making his letter part of the public record meant to embarrass or reproach me?<eos> I'd not suppose in that connection either.<eos> I'm to take you for majestically neutral?<eos> I'd make the less exalted claim, as a journalist, of keeping my opinions to myself.<eos> You are less majestically neutral than... than cloaking your cowardice in principle?<eos> I can only answer perhaps, Mr. Hearst.<eos> Events have not yet disclosed to me all that I am.<eos> Those kind of events could be in the weather, Merrick.<eos> You might have a second calendar for them.
Don't go!<eos> But there's food.<eos> All you can eat, free of charge!<eos> Don't just stand there, fill your faces with pasties, pies...<eos> They're lying.<eos> Easy for you to say.<eos> When did you last starve?<eos> All those people, disappearing off the streets.<eos> It's been going on for months.<eos> It's them.
I am though.<eos> And I'm sorry, Gran.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Don't talk like that.<eos> Do you know what you need?<eos> A nice sit down and a cup of tea.<eos> You got time?<eos> For you, I've got all the time in the world.<eos> Oh, you say that, but you're all talk.<eos> It's those new friends of yours, I don't trust them.
So, yeah.<eos> Get on with it, enjoy, enjoy!<eos> You can't stay, even if there was some way of telling them.<eos> Of course I can't.<eos> I've still got Mum at home, my real mum.<eos> I couldn't just leave her, could I? It's just...<eos> They've got each other.<eos> Mum's got no-one.<eos> She's got you, those two haven't.<eos> All these different worlds, not one of them gets it right.
I do.<eos> Little children have big imaginations.<eos> So don't you be embarrassed.<eos> It undoubtedly was your way of processing your grief.<eos> Right.<eos> I was wondering do you know what happened to Sarah's parents.<eos> Because I tried to look them up in the Hamilton phone book, but they were unlisted.<eos> They broke up shortly after Sarah passed away.<eos> You know, I understand that it often happens when a couple loses a child.<eos> Do you know where either one of them went?
Strep viridans can hit the heart.<eos> Wouldn't mess with the reproductive system.<eos> Maybe things aren't...<eos> so nicely connected.<eos> He's 65.<eos> We could be looking at multiple systems just starting to break down independently.<eos> Way to a man's heart is through his stomach.<eos> He's had acid reflux for years.<eos> It--it can't be relevant.<eos> It seems there are other ways to kill people besides having sex with them.
Shut up, all right?<eos> Just shut up.<eos> Ok, shut up. Please. Please, stop beating yourself up, ok?<eos> Miss Lena may be able to help you.<eos> Miss Lena?<eos> Please, please, please, admit it.<eos> Why else are you here?<eos> I'm here to talk to her students.<eos> Wake up and smell the unspoken need.<eos> You don't give a shit about them.
They're driving me out of my tiny little mind.<eos> Guys!<eos> You gonna have to...<eos> Oh my goodness!<eos> What happened to your face?<eos> We had an argument.<eos> Oh God, have you seen this?<eos> What's happening?<eos> The rioting has been going on all night.<eos> The men involved are young, angry and almost all of them work with computers.
It's deeper than that.<eos> As your editor, I have a basic problem with the journey of the book... or rather the lack of one.<eos> Uhm, but it's what happened to me so I don't know what I can do to change that.<eos> - Let me explain if I might.<eos> Of course.<eos> Each moment the blade penetrated my skin...<eos> I forgot what it was like to be on my face in the dirt.<eos> Every drop of blood was a reminder that I still belong to the earth... that I was flesh and blood... that those boys weren't everything in my body.<eos> Cutting myself, hurting myself, freed me from the hurt they inflicted.<eos> I was the one doing the damage, not them.
Right?<eos> Let me tell you something, Miss Teeter.<eos> Since you don't have enough decency to close your doors or windows, I've heard you two...<eos> I've seen you two!<eos> Are you saying it's your right to pollute the mind of my little grand-daughter?<eos> You know she looks up to you.<eos> Has stars in her eyes for you! And all this time, you must have been... you must have been looking at her like she was a little piece of meat!<eos> Now wait just a goddamn minute, Lana! - How dare you?<eos> - And I've had complaints. Complaints about your little pets!<eos> Seems one of them got lose, and now we have a missing dog.
How many times have I told you, he's not a toy.<eos> Hi, Gibbs.<eos> He's getting a little stressed out.<eos> So am I.<eos> Tell me you two have found Captain Pervert.<eos> That's Fleet Captain Pervert, and we keep losing his computer's connection in Spain.<eos> Un-lose it.<eos> It doesn't work that way.<eos> It's true, Gibbs.<eos> The servers are down in Madrid and we can't pick up his trace without them.
What if I fall in love with Burton and then ten years down the road the whole thing falls apart?<eos> If you don't try, you'll never know.<eos> Do you like the guy?<eos> Very much.<eos> Is he nice to you?<eos> So nice.<eos> But not so nice it makes me not like him anymore.<eos> What did your parents do to you?<eos> You know.<eos> You spent Christmas with them.
We're going to get through this.<eos> Talk.<eos> Jesse'll be here soon.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> I'm looking forward to it.<eos> When it's over, it's time to go.<eos> - We have bigger things to attend to.<eos> I'm not done here.<eos> People don't know how to act, what's good for them.
- Everybody drop the knives.<eos> Drop 'em.<eos> Jesse!<eos> - Mom, don't. - What did you do?<eos> - I did what they told me to.<eos> - No.<eos> They told you this would work?<eos> The God guys?<eos> They need some new leadership.<eos> God has nothing to do with them.
- Jesus.<eos> - That's 4.464 milligrams per day.<eos> Enough to raise your PKC, so you're suicidally depressed.<eos> - Where are the worms coming from?<eos> - They lay their eggs in the water.<eos> -That's where their life cycle begins.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> They're mimicking Nematomorph hairworms.<eos> What?<eos> Oh. I just finished reading about them.
Found your fingerprints on the baby, Tevares.<eos> Dried in the mother's blood.<eos> Sean and Tevares killed that lady so you could have the baby.<eos> And then what?<eos> It got too much for you to handle.<eos> He cried too much.<eos> So you let them beat him to death.<eos> We also have your friends.<eos> We've got their fingerprints.<eos> Pretty soon, one of them's gonna start to talk.
now just aim at jonathan's head and shoot.<eos> didn't general lane teach you anything ?<eos> actually, he did.<eos> get down, sir.<eos> martha ?<eos> lois.<eos> don't sweat it, smallville.<eos> better late than never.<eos> "regard your soldiers as your children, "and they will follow you into the deepest valleys.<eos> "look on them as your own beloved sons...
What's it all for, though, Tony, huh? What we put in, the grind.<eos> Isn't that for things like this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So I heard Phil came to see you.<eos> Let's go say hello to your dad.<eos> So how you doing here?<eos> You having a good time?<eos> - Which one are you?<eos> - My friend Tony, Pop.<eos> Hey, I'm gonna say a few things, and these pricks are watching, so I'm gonna make like I'm talking to your dad and them.
Then what?<eos> Well, we will continue until we have conquered all of our enemies.<eos> And you think our retrovirus can do all that?<eos> Yes.<eos> The one we're freely handing over to you.<eos> I see.<eos> Your people will not be harmed.<eos> Such will be the nature of our agreement.<eos> And what about all the other humans on the other worlds?<eos> Any chance you'll stop feeding on them?
There's nothing else that could be Sam.<eos> The question is how's Roy controlling the damn thing.<eos> That cross.<eos> What?<eos> There was this cross.<eos> I noticed it in the church tent, I knew I seen it before.<eos> Here.<eos> Tarot?<eos> It makes sense.<eos> I mean, tarot dates back to the early Christian, right? When some priests were still using magic? And a few of them viewed into the dark stuff.
I'm still scared all the time. Like...<eos> I'm waiting for that next beating.<eos> I'm just tired of being scared.<eos> If I do this, it'll be all over.<eos> No, don't you get it?<eos> It won't.<eos> The nightmares won't end Max.<eos> Not like this.<eos> There's just... More pain.<eos> And it makes you as bad as them.
The scarecrow god ?<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> Well, you better start believing, because I'm gonna need your help.<eos> Now, we can destroy the scarecrow, but we got to find the tree.<eos> What tree ?<eos> Maybe you can help me with that.<eos> It would be really old.<eos> The locals would treat it with a lot of respect, like it was sacred.<eos> There was this one apple tree.<eos> The immigrants brought it over with them.
Hey, what is that?<eos> That, brother, is a new species.<eos> Where did you find the egg?<eos> Out in the harbor, by Figure Eight.<eos> There was a whole bunch of them.<eos> So you took it home.<eos> And put it in our fish tank.<eos> We have some of the eggs here, but they're not fertilized.<eos> But a Iot of eggs have hatched.<eos> whole swarms of them.
Please remain calm and proceed in an orderly fashion.<eos> Stay together.<eos> Everybody just stay together.<eos> Wait,stop stop stop.<eos> Stop!<eos> Why?<eos> There are three of us.<eos> Bags-give me your bags.<eos> Why?<eos> We don't have room for them.
- Yes, sir.<eos> - Hayes, help him.<eos> Molly, we have a serious problem down here.<eos> Novak attacked Adams took his pass card, weapon too.<eos> He's released Janklow and Sanford.<eos> Alright, the building been sealed and we got snipers covering every exit point.<eos> They won't get far.<eos> - Cavanaugh, what's going on?<eos> - We got two men down badly wounded.<eos> No sign of them.
You'll note the newspaper's two days old.<eos> You think I don't know pictures can be faked?<eos> Ricardo faked his own death to avoid some problems he was having with the Salvadorans.<eos> - You mean with the Bolivians.<eos> - No.<eos> He paid off Mr. Bonita.<eos> It was Mr. Aleria in El Salvador who was growing impatient.<eos> I can get Ruiz on the phone right now.<eos> You sensed I would not shoot one of my boys.<eos> I've grown too fond of them.
- How's the fireworks show holding up?<eos> - We're on our last few.<eos> Make 'em last.<eos> We need more time.<eos> You're about to hear the real thing, boss.<eos> We got visitors.<eos> Roger that.<eos> Call off your soldiers.<eos> Tell them they're just fireworks.<eos> And then tell them to go home... now.
Oh, is she a security risk?<eos> Is she shacking up?<eos> No. You tell me she was coming to the aid of an abused wife.<eos> Is that what you said?<eos> I was trying to protect you.<eos> Is that what you said?<eos> 'Cause in my youth, we called that a lie.<eos> I was trying to... you go on about honor and faith and how a good military wife acts.<eos> You sleep with the colonel and you drag me into a real estate scam.<eos> And the man who sends our husbands out into the storm, the man who decides which of them goes on what missions.
Just yes or no.<eos> Your translator, elsabet, she learned her english in the u.s., far as you can tell?<eos> Yes.<eos> That is all.<eos> Get me the dossiers on bob's crew. Right.<eos> And find me what division san francisco state plays and what conference.<eos> Men's soccer.<eos> But we just determined... soccer players sometimes exchange jerseys.<eos> Trade shirts after a game.<eos> If he didn't play for them, he might have played against.
- What did his public schedule say?<eos> - Voting in Santa Paula.<eos> - We should have him in California.<eos> - Little late.<eos> Hundred and fifty thousand square miles in California, 13 million voters.<eos> We can't plant him in a mall and hope he reaches the undecideds.<eos> - That's what Vinick's doing.<eos> - Donna's doing spin and the congressman will hit L.A. With some drive-time radio.<eos> Leo have an impact in Akron?<eos> I heard 17,000 voters didn't budge when the skies opened and dumped buckets of water down on them.
Come on, I need help down here!<eos> I need...<eos> Here we go.<eos> But these Cybermen, what have they got to do with the ghosts?<eos> Don't you listen?<eos> A footprint doesn't look like a boot.<eos> Achieving full transfer.<eos> They're Cybermen.<eos> All the ghosts are Cybermen!<eos> Millions of them!
There's one for awesomeness?<eos> Yeah, I had it made.<eos> Sit.<eos> Hey, so, now that I'm working here, are you finally going to tell me exactly what your job is?<eos> Please.<eos> - My dawg!<eos> - My dawg!<eos> Hey, Blauman, Bilson, this is Marshall.<eos> These guys are in legal.<eos> You're gonna be working with them.
You need to get control of the situation and get somebody into that school.<eos> We know where one kid's at.<eos> Now, can you guarantee me that's the only kid who walked into that school with a gun this morning?<eos> Look, mayor, this is a static situation.<eos> If and when it becomes active, we will intervene.<eos> But until then, there's a mandated procedure.<eos> We secure the area, we wait for the crisis negotiator, and we pray to god that Tree Hill High doesn't become just another catchphrase that people only whisper about for the rest of time.<eos> Is it true?<eos> Is it Jimmy Edwards?<eos> One of them.
The day I stopped being there -- that was the best day.<eos> Well, that was kind of depressing, so I went home and took an antidepressant.<eos> And then I took another one, and then for fun I took 12 more.<eos> My mom and the doctors called it an accident.<eos> And then two weeks later when I got back to school... nobody noticed.<eos> It was like I never left.<eos> I guess that's the upside of not being there in the first place, right?<eos> Nobody misses you when you're gone.<eos> It's not supposed to be this way.<eos> The artists and the scientists and the poets none of them fit in at 17.
It's damaged.<eos> Probably from the war with the Wraith.<eos> - Beyond repair?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Their scientists, or at least the folks who call themselves scientists, have been working on it for years, but it's way out of their league.<eos> They know how to turn things on and off, but as far as fixing problems...<eos> Rodney should still have the technical specs you brought back from the Aurora mission.<eos> I told him to take a look at 'em, but first, I want him to fix the shield generator, build some goodwill with these people.<eos> Good idea.<eos> Hopefully we can establish an alliance with them.
Stewart had issues.<eos> When he went away...<eos> He went away to where?<eos> Prison, but it was just for drugs.<eos> Ceci talked me into having Sam.<eos> It wasn't your idea?<eos> Ceci was older, and she controlled the money because my parents thought she was more responsible.<eos> She was, wasn't she?<eos> She arranged for Jose and Elena to adopt Sam.<eos> Why them?
No, we've been using shower caps.<eos> Skinner!<eos> You made that tv show really mad.<eos> Yes, well you won't think it's so funny when we send Bart here.<eos> "Upward bound:<eos> "The toughest behavioral modification camp in northwest Oregon."<eos> It's the only place cruel enough to straighten Bart out.<eos> They use a proven concept "tough hate"<eos> to turn around foul-mouthed hooligans.<eos> Then they send them home, quietly ticking away.
Tell the press that it was nothing more than a heart attack.<eos> Why?<eos> It seems like Kira is trying to test something with these deaths.<eos> See?<eos> It's all here; the information they didn't give in their statement.<eos> The killings were carried out just as I'd written.<eos> What a surprise!<eos> Today in Kanagawa at 2:40 in the afternoon... There was a robbery at Teikai Bank which left three employees dead.<eos> Three men disappeared with 2.5 million yen.<eos> Later, two of them were captured, but one is still on the run.
Okay, what's this about, kids?<eos> I'm a doctor, very busy.<eos> - You're Archibald Morris.<eos> - Yeah. What do you need?<eos> You better have a seat.<eos> Here's the deal.<eos> We four live with different parents, but we all share the same dad.<eos> We're not supposed to be able to find out the identity of our father.<eos> But the Donor Sibling Registry allows us to find out the identity of each other.<eos> So I got in contact with them via e-mail. And it actually turns out that little Max here is actually a computer genius.
- Sean, listen to me.<eos> All I'm saying is that you're 25 years old<eos> You know what ?<eos> Don't profile me Aaron !<eos> Now I see it.<eos> Terra Mesa New Mexico,<eos> Five deads, all from Mesa university.<eos> No signs of sexual assault and no sign of theft.<eos> Five 19 year olds, minimal defensive wounds.<eos> One of them was impaled in a 6-foot wooden pole.
I'm not going.<eos> What?<eos> What do you mean, you're not going to chicago?<eos> I'm not going, period.<eos> Oh, marin, honey... you can't stay here.<eos> They don't have a nail place or a--or a spinning class.<eos> I need to breathe and start my book.<eos> About marriage?<eos> About men.<eos> But you said you didn't know anything about them.
What?<eos> What is going on with you?<eos> -lt's not cholera, is it?<eos> -l'm fine.<eos> Cirrhosis.<eos> -Spironolactone.<eos> -You have hepatitis.<eos> Schistosomiasis as a child. Left me with a few liver granulomas.<eos> What is that?<eos> That could be them, huh?
Especially when they're young.<eos> They haven't turned on you yet, right?<eos> - Your wife is beautiful. - Mm.<eos> No idea what she was doing with me.<eos> Cancer.<eos> Even towards the end though, she was something else.<eos> I've got meetings in the city all day.<eos> I'll be back by 6.<eos> I'm entertaining guests.<eos> - Yeah, you gonna sing for them? - Ha-ha.
I need you to talk to me about your cancer.<eos> It's okay.<eos> No, it's not okay.<eos> Ellie?<eos> Ellie?<eos> I read a poem once about a girl who had a crush on a guy who died.<eos> She imagined him up in heaven with all the beautiful angels.<eos> And she was jealous.<eos> Ellie is gone.<eos> I imagine her with the badass angels now, hanging out with them in their black leather jackets, causing trouble.
why'd you want this unit?<eos> Honestly?<eos> I took the sergeant's test, scored pretty high, but not high enough, and Lieutenant Hoskins, we went through the academy together.<eos> He said that this-- This is a good detail for going up the ladder.<eos> I mean I know you have to do it for a while, but maybe next year, if I do good here, they'll reach down for me.<eos> Next year?<eos> I mean, for some things, that's a long time to wait.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I hear you're a good cop.<eos> I also hear you recognize who your friends are and that you're loyal to them.
They can't sit still in the class.<eos> The others can and do.<eos> - So separate the two.<eos> - That's tracking.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Tracking students.<eos> It's a nasty phrase in educational circles.<eos> It refers to the grouping of children based on expected performance.<eos> - What's wrong with it?<eos> - It says you have reduced expectations for certain students, that you expect less from them academically.
If that impacts on your life in a bad way, then I'm sorry.<eos> And I'm gonna make it right.<eos> I promise.<eos> But we're not gonna talk about that.<eos> Let's talk about what we're thankful for.<eos> And I'm thankful for my family and my friends.<eos> And my new friends. And I'm also thankful that I live in a country where I can eat till I'm full three times a day, seven days a week.<eos> And I'm thankful for two-ration beef with mushroom sauce, and heat and dust and roadblocks and Haji Pepsi, and kids who run up and hug you, and kids who spit at you, and mothers having babies faster so they can grow up to kill you.<eos> And the boys, who are young and brave and scared,<eos> and the Kevlar propped against upside-down M-16s with boots next to them,
"Symphony of Destruction."<eos> -Who is that, Stravinsky?<eos> -Megadeth.<eos> Don't ask.<eos> What are you playing?<eos> The teacher closes the recital, right?<eos> Uh, I'm not.<eos> It's about the students, not me.<eos> Parents wanna know what they pay for. They sign the checks.<eos> Well, that's too bad for them.
Hey, what if he's got this whole island booby-trapped?<eos> Well, I guess we'll find out.<eos> I'm telling you, we need to find a working radio... so we can at least contact someone just in case we're-<eos> In case we're dead?<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> It sounded like some kind of signal call.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> "The humans are here."<eos> Aw, man.<eos> It's them.
No. Not quite everywhere.<eos> Great job...<eos> Hello.<eos> My name's Teatime.<eos> What's yours?<eos> ALBERT. SOMETHING HERE IS NOT RIGHT.<eos> Awk!<eos> Too right.<eos> This is the mythological persons' room.<eos> How come one of them die?
It's such old magic, it isn't even magic anymore.<eos> If you've got a piece of someone's hair, nail clipping or tooth, you can control them.<eos> Don't tell me someone is... –What's that shadow?<eos> And it's protecting itself.<eos> Now, what happened to the other fellow?<eos> WELL, THE HOGFATHER HAS ENEMIES.<eos> What'd he do? Miss a chimney?<eos> There's people down there, Mr Teatime!<eos> Well, just do away with them.<eos> One of them is a girl.
Do you happen to be in the market for a house?<eos> 'Cause this baby's a honey.<eos> - Something in the corner just moved.<eos> I'd have told you about them before you bought the place.<eos> The law also requires me to inform you that the house has toxic mold, asbestos, methane gas, buckling floors, a crumbling foundation, visible fungus, a collapsed fireplace, ceiling damage, water damage, and it was the recent site of a Wicca convention,<eos> and a particularly grisly murder /suicide. Nothing we can't work with.<eos> I'm not in the market, Kirk.<eos> Now, listen.<eos> I know my parents are shopping for houses.<eos> Lane saw you with them, and I need to know where they are right now.

Bye.<eos> Byebye.<eos> You know, if there's anything you two need... This whole wedding is like a gift to Shane from me, so...<eos> Just talk to me, ok?<eos> Well, it's beautiful up here, isn't it?<eos> You're gonna try it?<eos> I see my friends down there.<eos> - The two boys on the snowboards?<eos> - Well, they're not boys.<eos> Well, one of them is, sort of...
Then they deserve to be uncomfortable, don't you think?<eos> No, I don't think anyone deserves to feel uncomfortable.<eos> Max, I don't understand why you wanna be like these people?<eos> You seem so much more interesting as who you are.<eos> How do you know who I am? You don't know who the fuck I am.<eos> How do you know I'm not like these people?<eos> Max, you're great the way you are and the way you were.<eos> You know what happens when you walk into this room?<eos> - What? - People will start watching you.<eos> They're looking at you closely. And at first they think you're one of them. But then they look a little more closely and they begin to feel uneasy because they realize you're not.
I want him pulled now.<eos> Want me to flunk him?<eos> I want a medical exemption.<eos> Brown, this is dr. Rhea morrison.<eos> You are very ill.<eos> We would like you to lie down so we can administer medication and fluid.<eos> Are my mates getting something to drink?<eos> That's my boy.<eos> They are.<eos> You want to treat me, take me back with them.

His stanford-binet suggests he's most personally imprinted on his leader.<eos> All the men look up to jonas.<eos> With williams, there's a deeper almost familial bond.<eos> And damned if you're not gonna exploit it.<eos> Williams, hector. I am an american... fighting man? [Laughs]<eos> That's right, you've been fighting all your life.<eos> Isn't that so, boy?<eos> 'Cause that's what they think of you, boy.<eos> Like your boy jonas.<eos> Just another boy to them, doing their dirty work, putting his life on the line.
Logan and I broke up, too, today.<eos> I'm moving out.<eos> How come?<eos> He cheated on me... with an entire wedding party.<eos> Oh.<eos> Nice.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Men suck.<eos> They do suck.<eos> Can't count on them.
I can't stand Usher. "<eos> Oh, my God, he's right.<eos> I hate Usher too. What?<eos> He's right.<eos> I think I hate black people.<eos> Tom, stop being stupid.<eos> No, I think I hate them all.<eos> I don't like Puffy.<eos> I don't like Kobe.<eos> I don't like- I don't like any of them. Tom, snap out of it.
The arrest report said the gun was dirty.<eos> Could've been fired.<eos> What caliber gun was used to shoot the Vargas brothers ?<eos> 38 caliber, or a nine-mil.<eos> And how much time between the Corvette being stolen and Leo and Sienna surrendering at the drawbridge ?<eos> An hour and a half.<eos> That's plenty of time to meet the Vargas brothers<eos> - at the Delgado Hotel and shoot them.<eos> - Let's take a look at the money<eos> - we caught them with.
Look, you're an Attending.<eos> I need you to be on the ball. Vic, I'm serious.<eos> Yeah, I'm serious too.<eos> You're seriously starting to piss me off.<eos> Because if you don't wanna work with me, that's fine. I don't need you.<eos> - Vic.<eos> Vic... Dr. Kovac.<eos> What, Frank?<eos> These gentlemen are looking for Dr. Rasgotra.<eos> One of them is a Military Casualty Officer.
Today's your lucky day.<eos> I'm gonna do a Seldinger technique. I'll wire up through the cricothyroid.<eos> It'd be faster to crike him.<eos> - No, you'll get infection and bleeding. Not to mention subglottic stenosis and a big, ugly-ass scar.<eos> Sats down to 84.<eos> Hypoxia's not good for you either.<eos> - Where's Neela?<eos> - She got called up to Surgery.<eos> We'll aspirate air, and then pass the wire through.<eos> There are soldiers looking for her and one of them is a chaplain.
I've tried to get them to most of my life.<eos> I guess I just gave up awhile back.<eos> I mean...<eos> I am what I am.<eos> But you... you've got a good reason to hate me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry for what I did.<eos> You were trying to protect your people.<eos> It wasn't you that killed Shannon.<eos> It was them.

So dude..<eos> Are you enjoying being a war reporter?<eos> Balls, I'm enjoying this!<eos> If only we'd listened to our parents.. ..should've become a doctor.. or an engineer..<eos> But no.. we had to go and become journalists!<eos> Why did you have to tell the boss.. ..that we would get an interview with the Taliban.. or die trying..<eos> Now you'll die.. definitely!<eos> Hey, how was I to know that our lives will really be at risk!<eos> These guys carry guns like we carry mobile phones..<eos> One of them even had a rocket launcher, did you see?
To sell some more gore. Some more inhuman horror stories to the world.. ..that chose to do nothing when this place was burning.<eos> And you know why I am doing it?<eos> I hope publisher's will line up for my book.. when I write all this.<eos> But what else do you think reporters can do?<eos> Nothing, I guess.<eos> Otherthan knowing in their hearts.. That whateverthey do.. is not enough.<eos> What have you done?<eos> Where are the reporters?<eos> They haven't come as yet. lt's really late.<eos> There's a small problem. When the Indian reporters saved.. ..us from the Hazara, there was a Talib with them.
Okay, see, now you're scaring me.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Okay. Ha, ha.<eos> I got nervous all of a sudden, but here it goes.<eos> My partners in l.a. Got the funding for my program and they're interested in moving forward.<eos> You mean with the support groups?<eos> That's amazing.<eos> That's good news, right?<eos> Yeah, it's great news.<eos> But to them moving forward would also mean moving.
- Hi, Molinari.<eos> You can play?<eos> I used to.<eos> I used to play in a band, or group, as they used to say.<eos> We named ourselves: "The Dark Side of the Moon".<eos> Like the Pink Floyd album, I love that one.<eos> You've heard at least one decent album in your life.<eos> All this time I knew nothing about you.<eos> Then you surprise me. You did exactly what I wanted to.<eos> Tell my teachers what I thought of them.
Well, I think we should start with blood work.<eos> I know when jesse was at the hospital, there was some confusion in the lab about your blood.<eos> Mm-hmm, well, there's no confusion now.<eos> It's definitely changed.<eos> It has much higher levels of hemoglobin.<eos> I think that's why I can stay underwater for so long.<eos> I didn't know that you could.<eos> But none of this is really what you're concerned about, is it?<eos> You want to know if there's something inside me that's gonna hurt our kids.<eos> I just think we owe them an explanation as to why they're not with you anymore, and since we don't have all the answers yet...
You know, Elliot, the four of us should go out to dinner.<eos> Why are you so obsessed about going out with other couples?<eos> Didn't you learn your lesson last week with our neighbors?<eos> Squirrel chili.<eos> Who knew? Ha!<eos> It's really good.<eos> Eat your soup.<eos> No.<eos> They're not our neighbors. They live in the woods behind our apartment.<eos> We'd be having brunch with them Sunday if you could have choked down the tail.
I'm afraid the Lieutenant and his men... are indisposed.<eos> Michael, listen to me.<eos> You're sick.<eos> You need to take your medication, now.<eos> It's too late for that, Doctor.<eos> I've regained enough memory to know that you've done this to me not once, but twice.<eos> You've witnessed how hurt... how betrayed I felt the first time.<eos> Well, try to imagine how I feel now.<eos> Why did you have to kill Lathan?<eos> He was stirring up trouble, but I knew our only chance was to wait until Colonel Sheppard left with the soldiers... most of them, anyway.
You're a functional vampire.<eos> Sure, you're heroic, useful to society.<eos> But only because it feeds you.<eos> There's nothing worth stealing, so don't even look.<eos> You don't just have a fetish for needy people, you marry them!<eos> - Here we go!<eos> - You mean it!<eos> And then time passes, suddenly they're not so needy anymore.<eos> Your fault.<eos> You've been there for them too much.
If the antibiotics didn't cause the anaphylaxis...<eos> It's still on the table.<eos> Everything is connected.<eos> What did we discuss?<eos> What was the differential? Cameron said...<eos> When Dan came to your house that night, did he go through any tall grass?<eos> Climbed a fence.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Your daughter had two visitors on Friday night.<eos> One of them is still in the room.
- You killed him.<eos> You may not have pulled the trigger, but you let him go into that school.<eos> Karen, I had no idea Keith was going inside.<eos> I was trying to keep everyone safe.<eos> I had responsibility as the mayor.<eos> Responsibility as the mayor!<eos> What about your responsibility as a brother?<eos> What about your responsibility as a father?<eos> You had two sons in there, Dan!<eos> Where were you for them?
Save the orphans<eos> They' re tax-deductible.<eos> Save the orphans<eos> Get them while they' re still cute.<eos> Save the orphans<eos> Get them young, teach them your tongue.<eos> Save the orphans<eos> Woody Allen can't marry them all.<eos> Save the orphans<eos> Some of them don't even have parents.
We're more than friends, Mrs. Van de Kamp.<eos> I love him.<eos> Oh.<eos> Why?<eos> Why?<eos> Yes. I'd be curious to know just what it is you see in him.<eos> Well, when my parents first heard I was gay, they kicked me out.<eos> They said I had debased the entire family and that they couldn't love me anymore until I changed.<eos> But Andrew--<eos> He said that I should be ashamed of them, 'cause they were too stupid to know how great I was.
Do you mind if I come along?<eos> Be my guest.<eos> Allison, you okay?<eos> You look like you've seen a ghost.<eos> Oh, sorry. This place just looks familiar.<eos> Maybe I've been here before<eos> Three males in stocking masks came through the door at 8:37 this morning.<eos> They fired several rounds into the ceiling to prove they were serious, then grabbed a female customer, and threatened to kill her if the tellers didn't hand over the money.<eos> Did they actually shoot anyone?<eos> No, but they did take the female customer with them when they left.

I bet I won't even make it through fourth grade.<eos> You'lle it through fourth grade, because I'm going to stay here and be your teacher.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> There's one thing I don't understand here.<eos> You never had detention all summer.<eos> That load of crap?<eos> No, I was just keeping her busy while Nelson stole microscopes.<eos> Make with the story.<eos> Well, my best recollection of Burns' paraphrasing of what he read in moe's letter is that Krabappel told Moe...<eos> I have to stay here in Springfield, because boys like Bart Simpson need me... sweet, misunderstood boys, who just need someone to recognize the basic goodness that's trapped inside them and is desperately trying to get out.
Yes or no?<eos> Well, we're pretty sure Ali intends to blow the place up on live TV.<eos> It makes for slightly more dramatic footage than a crater.<eos> - Better TiVo value.<eos> - So no cameras.<eos> No, it's the only angle he's given us.<eos> Uh, we can attempt to delay satisfaction for his demand and maybe propose an exchange for hostages.<eos> I can, uh, try and feel him out on the second call.<eos> Set up a briefing area for the media.<eos> We're going to need them to play ball.
- I don't have any kids.<eos> - Great!<eos> Jerry!<eos> What a nice surprise. Alan, a pleasure.<eos> What did you have for breakfast?<eos> English muffin.<eos> I see your... behavior modification is going well.<eos> Oh, it is.<eos> I've been working very hard to deal with my Asperger Syndrome.<eos> I've been learning to connect to people, to make eye contact, to shake hands... to show an interest in them even if I have none.
And what type is that?<eos> What type?<eos> The Ari type.<eos> You two look good together.<eos> You're in trouble.<eos> Why? I poured Super Glue all over my arm.<eos> We're stuck now.<eos> We have to go to the bathroom together like this.<eos> Good. I've always wanted to go to the men's room.<eos> They must have Super Glue on them, too.
- We have to.<eos> Why?<eos> Because this man is making direct threats against our family.<eos> Well, then why doesn't dad arrest him?<eos> He did, but he got out somehow, and now your father's concerned that he's gonna come after us.<eos> - Have those extra beds arrived yet?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> Okay, i want you to get on the phone to miami and find out where they are.<eos> They really don't think we'll be needing them, dr. Underlay. That is not for them to decide.<eos> Get them.
- Right, okay. - I want you to get a tambourine.<eos> Do you know how to play the tambourine ?<eos> I'm already getting the pizzas from Bernetti's, so...<eos> - You know, I can go with him.<eos> Okay !<eos> Thank you, Ryan<eos> Good attitude. Hottest in the office.<eos> All right, now what kind of pizza do you like ?<eos> I don't get why parents are always complaining about, how tuff it is to raise kids.<eos> You joke around with them.
Oh, let us guess...<eos> - you're the real Ba'al.<eos> - Precisely.<eos> No doubt, the impostor promised you the location of Merlin's weapon if you helped him get rid of the rest of us.<eos> That's right.<eos> You do realize he has no idea where it is<eos> - or how to find it.<eos> - But you do.<eos> Of course.<eos> I obtained the information only after the clones were created, and needless to say, I never shared it with them.
- But you do.<eos> Of course.<eos> I obtained the information only after the clones were created, and needless to say, I never shared it with them.<eos> You know what, this is giving me a headache.<eos> What do you say we finish this off at home?<eos> Let's go, Spartacus.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Now I can see the difference.<eos> I still cannot.<eos> Do we really believe only one of them knows how to find the weapon?

And you, get rid of that stuff.<eos> Bloody animals.<eos> You and your-- your bloody 4-wheel drives. Think you own the road!<eos> I do, actually.<eos> Angus Oldfield.<eos> What hole did you crawl out of? WEKA.<eos> The Whole Earth Kollective Aotearoa.<eos> I know all about your Frankensheep!<eos> Mother Nature spent millions of years making sheep. She doesn't need your help! Don't talk to me about nature.<eos> Man made sheep what they are today, and I'm making them what they'll be tomorrow.
We must be vague.<eos> We make it hard on purpose.<eos> It sure is a novel idea.<eos> My article's being torn apart.<eos> "The rustic farmhouse evoked nostalgic sentiments of home."<eos> Problem is the writing.<eos> What problem?<eos> Would you talk like this when telling friends about the place?<eos> No, but...<eos> I'm no writer but maybe you should just talk straight to them.
I haven't seen one ghost since the accident, not even in the hospital.<eos> What if the ghosts are really here, right in front of me,<eos> - and I just can't see them anymore? - Shh, honey.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's all right.<eos> You're gonna be all right.<eos> You're telling me you don't see a single ghost?<eos> It's so weird.<eos> I've seen ghosts all my life.<eos> I mean, it's bizarre to know that they're out there and not be able to communicate with them.
No.<eos> Maybe it's like... allergies, you know?<eos> You always had migraines, right?<eos> Because you were trying to suppress the visions, the sounds.<eos> But your headaches are gone now.<eos> What if there aren't any visions or sounds to suppress?<eos> What if the spirits themselves have just vanished?<eos> Couldn't be.<eos> They're all around us, always.<eos> That is what is so annoying about them.
- I just know he is.<eos> - Ok.<eos> Come on.<eos> My ring!<eos> It's here.<eos> Caitlin, he's here.<eos> Brian is?<eos> Right now?<eos> Your ring, it acted as an anchor.<eos> Sometimes ghosts can attach themselves to things that have a deeper meaning to them.
"Not sure" meaning what?<eos> We think whoever set up the crime scene might be after Abby.<eos> Me?<eos> Who would want to kill me?<eos> I mean, Tony, I understand...<eos> Hey!<eos> The name Mikel Mawher ring a bell?<eos> It should.<eos> He placed over 200 phone calls to you in the last four months.<eos> One of them, right before the accident.
The president will be there when the coffin's put on the plane.<eos> - That's a good idea. - Yeah.<eos> - What's up, Mike?<eos> - I just got a call from Karen Hayes at CTU.<eos> Do you know about the president's decision to pull them off the acquisition of Bauer?<eos> - No.<eos> But what's the problem?<eos> - It doesn't really make any sense.<eos> Karen's teams are closer, they can do it more efficiently.<eos> Bauer's more likely to cooperate with them than with a group of military police.
I didn't crash the bus.<eos> I could never have hurt all those kids.<eos> I don't know, Woody.<eos> The welfare of children doesn't seem to have been terribly high on your list.<eos> That's not how it was.<eos> It wasn't that way at all.<eos> Those boys - if you knew their fathers, how they ignored them, mistreated them.<eos> They needed someone.<eos> I listened to them.<eos> I cared about them.
- The protocols are clearly specified.<eos> We're compelled to take pre-emptive action.<eos> - What action?<eos> - The aircraft must be shot down.<eos> We've scrambled an F-18 out of Point Mugu.<eos> We just need your approval to engage.<eos> There are over 50 people on that plane, Admiral.<eos> We have to think of the people on the ground.<eos> Over 20 million citizens live in Los Angeles.<eos> Each one of them is now a potential target.
First Sergeant Downing received the most damage.<eos> Three in the chest.<eos> Here, here and here.<eos> And once to the back, just below the heart.<eos> That's the kill shot, huh?<eos> Yes, well, it ruptured his inferior vena cava.<eos> As to our walking pictograms-one bullet each.<eos> These gang tats?<eos> It's not my field of expertise but I've had Mr. Palmer document the entire line for further investigation.<eos> Some of them were quite, uh, explicit.
So I've heard. Uh...<eos> So, a hard freeze December 9?<eos> Our key is that the bodies were not frozen inside the ice, but were below it.<eos> So they died after the 9th?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> No, human bodies sink until the gases created by the internal putrefication have had time to accumulate.<eos> How long does that take?<eos> Under the forecasted weather conditions?<eos> Ten to 14 days.<eos> The bodies went into the water between November 25 and December 9, or they would have resurfaced and the top ice would have formed around them.
What are you- lisa cuddy,this is patrick linehan.<eos> Patrick's going to be the new intern rotating in my department.<eos> I didn't even know you were looking for one.<eos> Sorry,I laugh when I'm nervous.<eos> Bet you've been doing that your whole life, huh?<eos> What kind of medicine are you interested in, patrick?<eos> Cancer,infectious disease.<eos> The big devils.<eos> I think that medicine has become too institutionalized.<eos> We need to send a message to our patients that we're just like them.
- Hey, I'm just saying...<eos> - Maybe we can have puppet O'Neill jump over a puppet shark on a one-third scale motorcycle.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Look, you don't know the business like I do.<eos> I don't have any money, so I have to give the actors something else.<eos> Bigger trailers? I can't afford that either.<eos> No, I have to give them something that costs me nothing but no actor can refuse.<eos> And what's that?<eos> A good ego stroking.<eos> I have to make them think that I re-wrote the script just for them.
there is, but not until they deliver a verdict.<eos> which will be?<eos> when you finish your investigation.<eos> oh, do you hear yourself?<eos> this is impossible.<eos> there were threats against that jury, will.<eos> we're investigating that.<eos> the jurors were informed.<eos> they mostly elected to stay.<eos> one of them died.
- No.<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> No, no!<eos> It's horrible, isn't it?<eos> Isn't it?<eos> Please...<eos> Open your eyes and look at what you did!<eos> Look or I'll cut your eyelids right off your face.<eos> It took me a long time to get these little boys clean.<eos> One of them had been in the ground so long he was falling apart.
From Frankfurt, he was air-vaced to Bethesda.<eos> They faxed me his hospitalization records.<eos> He was in a coma for 19 days.<eos> -My God!<eos> -Now that's not terribly unusual, but the tests weren't typical of someone who was in a coma that deep.<eos> I mean, his CAT scan didn't reveal any cerebral damage, his EEG was normal.<eos> It's the same as now.<eos> How do you explain that?<eos> Sometimes, patients don't seem to want to wake up.<eos> Any reason why Gibbs might be one of them?
Yeah, but still, maybe something happened at the party.<eos> Yeah, something enough to motivate a killer.<eos> You got a list of kids at the party?<eos> Can you put it up?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We just need to find the connection between these names and one of the DMG kids.<eos> Karen Camden.<eos> Wait a minute, she was on the police report?<eos> She has a connection to all the DMG kids.<eos> Yeah, she wrote a story about them for the school paper.
Yeah.<eos> We just need to find the connection between these names and one of the DMG kids.<eos> Karen Camden.<eos> Wait a minute, she was on the police report?<eos> She has a connection to all the DMG kids.<eos> Yeah, she wrote a story about them for the school paper.<eos> She knows them really well.<eos> She knows they were having violent fantasies.<eos> Yeah, but why would she want to take part in this attack?<eos> I don't know, but it might explain why they spared her, not just because she gave them props in the school newspaper.
- Totally!<eos> I got a great idea for- - [Horn Honking]<eos> Hey, Steve, we're going to the river.<eos> Hop in.<eos> That's Vince freaking Chung.<eos> What's he want with you?<eos> Oh, um, we-we started talking in the hall today.<eos> I guess those steroids must have increased my confidence.<eos> That's fantastic.<eos> You have to go with them.
I agreed to show Mohammed uncensored!<eos> I did what you asked!<eos> What do you want from me? !<eos> Sir! Sir!<eos> If you don't my saying, I think you asked for this.<eos> You gave in to the manatees last week.<eos> Now they know all they have to do is refuse to work and they can get whatever they want.<eos> You spoiled them by caving in.<eos> Now they thnk they can walk all over you.<eos> Sir, you are in charge of this network, not them.
Mm-hmm.<eos> A little tired. And very, very angry.<eos> That's because the flashbacks you're experiencing are drudging up some long-buried emotions that may be coloring your conscious mind.<eos> I'm going to kill both of you in the most painful way possible.<eos> Things will go a lot faster if you just relax.<eos> Whenever you're ready.<eos> Jackson, rise and shine.<eos> What is it? What's going on?<eos> Barrett... he came through for us. He just sent over a list of suspected trust safehouses.<eos> Hopefully our girl's in one of them.
But interfering a little bit is fine, is it?<eos> It might be a good idea to be a bit less confrontational.<eos> But she's here chatting with us.<eos> That's interference, isn't it?<eos> If you really are Morgan le Fey, how do I know your intention is to help us?<eos> According to legend, you were Merlin's greatest rival.<eos> Merlin is both Moros and Myrdin.<eos> For a time in your history, yes, I was his rival.<eos> But we're talking about many thousands of years, Dr. Jackson, as you know... things change.<eos> When we first abandoned Atlantis all those millennia ago, the Earth was so harsh, its people so primitive by comparison there was no hope of living among them as Lantians or rebuilding our society so, instead we spread out to many lands,
Though greatly outnumbered, they relied on their technological superiority to give them a needed advantage.<eos> Soon, they succeeded in creating one.<eos> Instead of building bigger, more powerful weapons, they chose to build smaller ones... microscopic machines designed to infiltrate and destroy from within.<eos> Nanites.<eos> In these tiny killing machines, the Ancients imbued an aggression that surpassed even that of their enemy.<eos> The technology allowed for organic assimilation and self-replication to increase their effectiveness, and replicate they did.<eos> They grew in numbers, evolving at a rate that took the Ancients by surprise.<eos> The molecular machines began interlocking, assembling themselves to form even more complex organisms, eventually evolving into the most effective and efficient form they knew of.<eos> This is how we were born.<eos> We took the image of our creators, yet we were far different from them.
Hey! - Where's the damn radio? !<eos> Put it on channel one and call my dad or stepdad, anybody!<eos> You come here!<eos> - Where?<eos> - Move!<eos> - What the hell are you doing?<eos> - You're going swimming!<eos> You wanna push people around? !<eos> You want to take over the world? !<eos> - I'm not one of them!
I wanted to be with strambi, but they were 'sub-strambi'.<eos> For Aberdeen, there were ...<eos> strambi ... in the media. There were the alternative, were simply 'deformed'.<eos> Fortunately I found a gay friend I imped? if you would kill all the time.<eos> It seems all knew was gay but nobody told me ...<eos> or not I realized ... until ...?<eos> there prov? with me, one evening . and I said to him the theatrical that I was not gay but that would be remained his friend.<eos> After I realized that I watched people so yet most bizarre than usual.<eos> Then they started bersagliarmi to ... some boys ...<eos> It felt threatened, perch? were naked and I, for them, I was gay.
Delusional machines.<eos> What's the universe gonna come up with next ?<eos> Is it really worth it, Caprica ?<eos> Is the love of that man really worth possibly losing all of this ?<eos> If you ever experienced love, you wouldn't have to ask.<eos> In recent months, the Cylons have been recruiting and training humans in an attempt to establish a human police force.<eos> It is hard to think of anything more despicable than humans doing the dirty work of the cylons,<eos> led to believe they were merely taking the civilian security out of the hands of the Cylons.<eos> And members of the human police have since become an extension of the cylons' corporeal authority.<eos> And while their names are kept deeply confidential, there is no question, some of them are people we might least expect.
We both like brussels sprouts.<eos> You don't like brussels sprouts.<eos> A man can change, Zack.<eos> What, a human tooth?<eos> Yeah, it was some kind of...some flesh, some fabric; it looked like some kind of shell.<eos> Yeah, sounds like to make you forget.<eos> Somebody doesn't want you to know what happened to John Doe 361.<eos> Booth, I'm not under a spell.<eos> Well, you forgot a whole day.<eos> The spirits don't need you to believe in them, Dr. Brennan; they believe in you.
They took the money we made.<eos> Gave us like a thousand for each run.<eos> So why'd you keep working for them?<eos> Dude, like I said, this Yuri guy doesn't let you just stop.<eos> If we tried to stop, we were dead.<eos> These guys were working for the Russians?<eos> I mean, come on, are we buying this?<eos> No, it's a classic Russian mob scheme.<eos> They hang out at cybercafes, check cashing operations, looking for people pulling off scams.<eos> Yeah, and then force them to work for them with threats and blackmail.
Get used to the magnitude of this place, what it's taken to keep this country free.<eos> All societies build monuments to their dead to convince future combatants that it's an honor to die in battle.<eos> Well, for these servicemen, it was, you know?<eos> And somebody to use this place to protest the war--it just pisses me off.<eos> These are the lives that gave them that right.
Not gonna lie to you.<eos> It's hard.It eats at you.<eos> We rarely have all the answers,lindsay.<eos> I still lose sleep over the ones that got away.<eos> I want to know why.<eos> Why did you do it?<eos> Why sara?<eos> You came all the way down here for that?<eos> These are the,uh,dna results from all the open rape cases in the city.<eos> None of them come back to D.J. Pratt.
Jack. That recording was my only immunity.<eos> They give me a piece of paper, I walk out of here, I'm a dead man.<eos> Two days, two hours, two months, who cares?<eos> They're donna take me down.<eos> Who's "they"?<eos> Same people who made Walt Cummings look like a suicide.<eos> Come on, Jack.<eos> You can't really believe that Logan masterminded this by himself?<eos> - Give me the names.<eos> - You can't touch them.
How we doing with Forensics?<eos> That's the colonel's domain, but my understanding is that we're sending a lab team to every house.<eos> So far we're finding 9-millimeter casings.<eos> Once they start scoping at the morgues, we'll probably have slugs to go with them.<eos> Tracewise, we're laser-printing around every body and vacuuming every crime scene for hair and fiber, but, of course, these are vacants.<eos> It'll take our lab a year to sift that many bags of dirt.<eos> - Is this all from one drug crew?<eos> - Probably.<eos> - Marlo Stanfield's bunch.<eos> - Where are we on them?
Does he? We have one tithe after another for the King in the Holy Land.<eos> Making ends meet...<eos> It was wrong, but my boys, they took some game.<eos> I went to stop them, but so did Gisborne's lot.<eos> They got caught.<eos> Me too.<eos> Someone had to lose a hand.<eos> Better me than Will, or little Lukey.<eos> I'm old.<eos> They've got years ahead of them.
We're hoping to find Riaz on them.<eos> Thanks.<eos> How you holding up since your sister's funeral ?<eos> Not as well as I thought.<eos> The hits just keep coming.<eos> It's the feds.<eos> I guess I'm up next.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - You talk to them yet ?
The cenotes are, in effect, gigantic fresh water wells.<eos> Away from the life-giving rays of sunshine one might not expect to find plants.<eos> But in the darkness of the cave tunnels roots of giant tropical trees have pushed their way through cracks in the limestone to reach the flooded caverns.<eos> Without this water the Yucatan's forest could not grow so luxuriantly.<eos> The Maya knew that their lives depended on this water, but it's only with the help of today's technology that we've come to appreciate the full significance and scale of these flooded passageways.<eos> So far, more than 350 miles of underwater galleries in the Yucatan have been mapped, but still nobody yet knows the true extend of this subterranean waterworld.<eos> And with good reason.<eos> Underwater caving is notoriously dangerous.<eos> When the nearest exit may be hundreds of metres or more away, running out of air down here would be fatal.<eos> To avoid getting lost divers carry with them a spool of string. It becomes their lifeline... literally.
With who?<eos> Mr. Sherman,I appreciate you coming down here.<eos> In the course of investigating the death of your friend,your client dr. Bannister, some questions have arisen about the nature of his medical practice.<eos> My questions really have to do with certain civil suits that were pending against dr. Bannister prior to his passing.<eos> I see.<eos> I was hardly privy to everything about his practice, but I'll be glad to tell you what I know.<eos> Do you recognize any of the names on the list?<eos> I take it this is a list of dean's patients?<eos> Yes,I do.<eos> I did business with several of them.

He'll do anything, give anything sell any thing all for a little hope<eos> And you gave that hope.<eos> Yes,I did.<eos> And dr. Bannister gave them even more than that.<eos> He gave them results.<eos> The man was considered something of a miracle worker.<eos> You see,that's the strange part.<eos> That's the part that we can't quite figure out because,for a miracle worker, dr. Bannister was having a pretty off year.<eos> How do you mean?<eos> Of the 23 patients involved in bannister's experimental drug program, 12 of them died in the past nine months.

What's wrong?<eos> Something attacked us, man.<eos> It came out of nowhere.<eos> - It attacked my buddy, Mike.<eos> - All right, all right.<eos> Take me to Mike.<eos> This way.<eos> So it seems our large dead friend up in the lab used to look like this... native to P9J-333, a docile herbivore.<eos> Very shy... and completely harmless, according to the locals.<eos> Well, it seems one of them at least has had an identity crisis.
It is if you're a surgeon.<eos> Come on.<eos> How's your mom ?<eos> You know.<eos> Crazy as a loon.<eos> When she's on her meds, she's almost like a normal person.<eos> I always liked her.<eos> She once told me that I reminded her of her first lover.<eos> What is it about parents ?<eos> Like you love them so much, and you spend your life trying to get away from them.
I don't know.<eos> So, what are you gonna do?<eos> You gonna go to a sperm bank?<eos> Well, I tried to talk her into a direct deposit.<eos> You know, straight from the tap.<eos> But she really dug in her heels. And not in the good way.<eos> - And you're okay with it?<eos> - Well, why not?<eos> I've sent billions of soldiers out there.<eos> It's time for one of them to finally take the hill.
I'm not talking about the fighting here.<eos> I mean, you walk through Hebron; you've got an Arab city; 100,000 Arabs;<eos> and settlers walking around with rifles, you know? Looking as if they own the place.<eos> The settlers can go in a Palestinian village and burn the fields there, destroy the house, hit Palestinians, even shoot Palestinians.<eos> Several of the women have been beaten by settlers on different occasions.<eos> In each of those cases, we were just being a nonviolent presence on the street, observing when settlers were acting out.<eos> And they just attacked different ones of us.<eos> The Israeli government is not doing anything to try and stop the settlers from violating Palestinian rights.<eos> From all the cases that settlers actually killed Palestinians, very few were accused of murder, but then the president came and gave amnesty or shortened the punishment that they received from the court.<eos> And, in some cases, they cooperate with them.
This bullet, it killed many of the kids who are demonstrating and who sometimes while they are throwing stones...<eos> As this case...<eos> I'll show you what happened.<eos> He is a 14-year-old from Khan Yunis.<eos> He was shot with one like this, and it entered here, and he died.<eos> A lot of the deaths have been children, and we do have some documentary evidence that security forces are firing on crowds of children.<eos> The soldiers weren't at risk.<eos> They're heavily armored.<eos> They have all this high-powered weaponry.<eos> And no child with a stone is going to be a risk to them.
because they started shooting.<eos> I was like, "No, Mom, I want to get an "A" in the class. Let me study."<eos> So I'm sitting there and all of the sudden, you hear something on my bedroom window.<eos> And I was just like, "Okay, maybe I should go downstairs."<eos> I couldn't study for my test.<eos> It's like...<eos> I tell my American friends:<eos> "It's like, do you understand what I'm going through?"<eos> The amazing thing is not that you have cases of suicide in students.<eos> The amazing thing is the bulk of them, they try to carry on in the middle of this mess, as if life is normal, as if they want to celebrate their graduation, and they want to build their life, and they want to carry on.
' Anyway, did anything happen ?<eos> i remember that, at one point, we started throwing rocks at the City Council windows.<eos> Tell me, did anybody in the town hall show up ?<eos> Nobody. not a single devil, as they say.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> You were saying...<eos> Yes... then we all decided to break through the doors of the City Council. But, of course, they were locked. Then we decided to break in through the emergency door but it was stuck.<eos> So we came back. And that's when the Secret Services guys showed up.<eos> How do you know they were from the Secret Services ?<eos> I just know... i recognized one of them. those people have...
Yes, yes. Something is...<eos> Beware the umbrella!<eos> It seems friendly, but really isn't!<eos> And I sense there was a sudden release of energy here, yes, very powerful.<eos> You're good.<eos> I've worked with psychics before, but you're really something.<eos> And I thought it was just bad feng shui.<eos> - I hate psychics.<eos> - I know, I know.<eos> But we have to use them.
Just supernatural fallout from what the professor's been doing.<eos> Not you.<eos> - It's like being in a cartoon!<eos> Chase these things into the closet or something.<eos> We have to find the professor.<eos> We cannot leave until you come for me.<eos> Why do you stay away?<eos> She will wait for eternity until the unfinished business is settled.<eos> It's all about the demons.<eos> I take care of them, everybody can go home happy.
You think she's one of us?<eos> Don't listen to him, Isabelle.<eos> Stop talking.<eos> She's not, Shawn.<eos> She killed her way across town to find me, and there's no way she's walking away.<eos> I said stop talking now.<eos> Isabelle, don't. Isabelle, don't.<eos> For the record, Daniel, I didn't kill your people.<eos> Not exactly.<eos> All I did was turn their abilities against them.
Not really.<eos> Well...<eos> You really wanna know?<eos> All I can say is that the tech works.<eos> I was a total victim of my reactive mind, but now I have this awareness...<eos> - So is this like therapy?<eos> - No way!<eos> How many people do you know actually got better from seeing a shrink?<eos> Those people don't listen, they interpret based on their own hang-ups and then lay their bullshit onto their patients.<eos> - Stay away from them, Matt.
Hear that, huh?<eos> Hear the night calling you?<eos> Oh, my little man. Why don't you just accept what you're becoming, huh?<eos> Oh, shit...!<eos> Let go of me!<eos> It's Mr. Chaney!<eos> From Kennedy.<eos> The math teacher.<eos> The one who got fired, remember?<eos> He got busted for luring those boys into his house, and doing shit to them!
Go get Kung out from there!<eos> Bastard!<eos> Who's that?<eos> What the!<eos> You arsehole!<eos> Stop playing around!<eos> OK, knock it off now!<eos> Oh, you want to sleep with the ghosts?<eos> No problem.<eos> Sleep with them!
- Thanks.<eos> I was afraid you were gonna chicken out.<eos> That's funny, she said the same thing about you.<eos> Thank you, Kandi.<eos> Are you sure this is what you wanna do?<eos> I'm sure.<eos> Are you?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Okay. Who's the lucky couple?<eos> Well, we're the ones getting married, so I guess it's them.
She chose her lovers for what they could do for her.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Dennis- ooh... was not at my house during the time of the murder.<eos> And you didn't see him again after he left the restaurant?<eos> No.<eos> And you'll sign a sworn statement to that effect?<eos> I will.<eos> Of course, considering that Walter and Dennis had already given Karen what she wanted, obviously. because she stopped having sex with them I started to ask myself on whom else might she use this unconventional business plan of hers.
Talk to you later, I can't make out what you're saying.<eos> You heard that?<eos> A hundred dead at the TV station.<eos> Those sons of bitches!<eos> Voinescu was on Grivita, near Regie.<eos> He says all's quiet there.<eos> Here's not bad either.<eos> They took Dinu and locked him up.<eos> Fuck that son of a bitch.<eos> See, now's the time to get rid of them all.
- You are revolting. - Yes.<eos> I am godless, aren't I?<eos> (Gisborne) Let's finish this here, Hood.<eos> Forget the Sheriff, forget the soldiers.<eos> Just you and me.<eos> Sorry, Gisborne. Trial by combat's not big and it's not clever.<eos> - So you are a coward.<eos> - I am no coward.<eos> I just do not trust you.<eos> Or them.
Don't you have enough of that in your life already?<eos> And she's off.<eos> - Do you act?<eos> - Every day.<eos> We have a great departement here at King and our teacher Mr Larson is awesome.<eos> He's featured in two episodes of Dawson's creek.<eos> It's LA so we get to learn from the expert.<eos> Yeah I was actually in a couple of plays back home.<eos> Great. Well, the film guys will worship you if you act in any of their films and...<eos> You never know. One of them may turn out to be Tarantino.
You mean, not tonight?<eos> I mean, not ever.<eos> You've been with us for over a week.<eos> You're telling us you haven't slept, not even once?<eos> Never.<eos> - Hi, hon.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I only have an hour.<eos> Those numbers.<eos> They planned everything around them.
It appears the two-week-old gay strike has actually helped Welling.<eos> Over 60% of voters support his decision to stand up to the protesters.<eos> You see?<eos> There you go.<eos> The moral majority's on my side.<eos> Conrad, you know, just because people disagree with you on this doesn't mean that they are immoral.<eos> Me, for instance.<eos> Well, you?<eos> You're on their side?<eos> It's not them or us, dear.
Have a nice day.<eos> It's all right, it's all right.<eos> Sergeant Gabriel, any luck with the gun?<eos> Yeah, NIBIN hit the jackpot.<eos> Our weapon was used in a previous shooting.<eos> Exact same gun. A 380 semiautomatic.<eos> I pulled the file.<eos> 3 years ago, 2 gang members exchanged a few rounds in Lincoln Heights. Aylesworth place.<eos> No one got hit, and both shooters ran off.<eos> But witnesses report seeing one of them toss a gun into the bushes.
After the birthday party?<eos> She said she'd been getting these phone calls in the middle of the night.<eos> Might be the ex-Husband.<eos> Ooh-Hoo-Hoo!<eos> Sounds like a real mess.<eos> Why are you smiling at me like that?<eos> Am I smiling?<eos> Yeah, and it's creeping me out.<eos> I wonder where all those boats are sailing off to.<eos> I wish I was on one of them.
I'm getting something.<eos> This friend you speak of,I sense you haven't seen him for a while,but you didn't tell anyone.<eos> No,you're not supposed to be here.<eos> You told your parents... you were going to computer camp.<eos> Computer camp,guys?<eos> Really?<eos> I know what you're hiding!<eos> We're not going after them?<eos> What for?<eos> Malone's not with them.
You really expect me to believe that you've been using Gennifer as a confidential informant?<eos> She's been in drug rehab for the past 2 months.<eos> Have you been calling her there?<eos> And remember, I can look that up.<eos> All right, look.<eos> We think we may be able to trace some of the stuff she's been buying to this... this biker gang.<eos> She mentioned something about bikers, I think, didn't she?<eos> She's convinced their trying to kill her.<eos> Are they?<eos> They knew she was ratting them out to us, maybe, yeah.
He was there for her when her dad died.<eos> They were good together.<eos> It's a shame.<eos> If it hadn't happened...<eos> What happened?<eos> You didn't know?<eos> Juno got murdered.<eos> That summer...<eos> He got into a fight with boys from Seoul.<eos> One of them was from here.
He's pushing where there's nothing.<eos> Cameron, you are an excellent doctor.<eos> You'll get lots of tearful thank-yous from grateful patients.<eos> Yeah, am I such a bitch for wanting that?<eos> Well, it's not a bad thing.<eos> But it's not why I'm here.<eos> I took this fellowship to learn from House.<eos> He's teaching you to be a masochist.<eos> Dry eyes goes on the board.<eos> In eight years, the patient experienced 214 symptoms, many of them repeating.
I do a little bit of everything.<eos> Oh, that sounds interesting, and maybe a little bit dangerous.<eos> Ooh, I like your jacket.<eos> I like it- okay, can i stop you there?<eos> First off,in your portrayal of me, I sound like I'm in the eighth grade.<eos> Well, in my portrayal of you, you only have an eighth grade education.<eos> Top of your class,graduated early... got it.<eos> College?<eos> Yeah?<eos> I'm new to town and I don't know many people... but I do know my cats. Two of them.
And our third shooter.<eos> The rampage continues for 15 minutes and ends when swat shows up right here.<eos> So how'd our third shooter get out?<eos> That's what we were wondering.<eos> Well,maybe our guy offed himself.<eos> Got caught in the cross fire.<eos> Cameron and neal had the only self-inflicted gunshot wounds.<eos> So,if our third shooter isn't one of the dead... he's posing as one of the survivors.<eos> *********I7 no dice.<eos> Still Keep at it,one of them's got to have seen something.
To make me think you contacted an evil ghost.<eos> Gus, please.<eos> Why didn't you float that idea by me sooner?<eos> That's genius.<eos> Somebody obviously wants us off this case.<eos> I think it's those convicts, but whoever it is, we'll never find them.<eos> I just saw them run off.<eos> You sure about that?<eos> Ladies, stay here.<eos> We're going after them... or it. Let's get some tacos.
Assumed to be the fifth in a series of rapes and murders over the past two years.<eos> Some women were abducted in parking lots,<eos> - others while they were running.<eos> - And when was she reported missing ?<eos> Technically she wasn't.<eos> Roommate thought she was visiting family.<eos> - Family thought she was at school.<eos> - Close to her family ?<eos> Very.<eos> She had dinner with them on sunday.
Be right back.<eos> I'm going to take kim back to the office.<eos> I'm surprised these clowns didn't confiscate her.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, that's not his.<eos> That's ours.<eos> You guys won't be needing it.<eos> I'm kind of sentimental.<eos> Hey, matt, we'll get it later.<eos> What are you, on their side now?<eos> Fighting them is a waste of time.
Real scary.<eos> Curly eyebrows.<eos> Curly eyebrows?<eos> They were huge!<eos> "The three assassins will come here too."<eos> "Killing machines."<eos> Right.<eos> They do have curly eyebrows.<eos> Who's that?<eos> What's he doing with them?
They complain about us every day. [Speaking Chinese]<eos> Also, watch those knobs for controlling temperature and those for steam.<eos> Don't laugh.<eos> Don't talk.<eos> You, stand behind him.<eos> Four in a row.<eos> Stand straight.<eos> Regarding the unqualified material, our group, 2B, did the worst.<eos> Every time we worked on 7562, if I didn't remind you, then nobody would label the bad items, so they got messed up.<eos> They were scattered everywhere. Besides this, the worst thing, there were no labels for them.
You are not in my house.<eos> Get off my property, right now.<eos> And my property goes all the way down the hill.<eos> You need to get back to town.<eos> The radiation's coming from Denver.<eos> I'm not leaving here.<eos> My parents are on their way back.<eos> --You talked to them?<eos> --No, freak, the phones are dead.<eos> But I'm not leaving here without them.
Here I am, thinking that free will still actually exists on...<eos> Wow.<eos> In the doorway.<eos> Get into the doorway.<eos> Goodwin!<eos> You see where the tail landed?<eos> Yeah, probably in the water.<eos> You run, you can make that shore in an hour.<eos> Ethan, get up there to that fuselage.<eos> There may actually be survivors, and you're one of them.
Because, Kate... the next two weeks are going to be very unpleasant.<eos> Yeah, hi... uh... I met a woman on the train... Sarah... and, uh, she dropped her cell phone, and I don't even know her last name, but your number was in her phone, so I was just wondering...<eos> I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<eos> Forget it.<eos> Hey.<eos> Just give me a minute, Dad.<eos> I asked you to give me a minute here.<eos> What's this?<eos> Why are you dialing all the numbers on Sarah's cell phone?<eos> Because one of them is him.
How weird was that, seeing that picture?<eos> Think about it, you and that guy could be related.<eos> I haven't stopped thinking about it.<eos> If Josh were here, he'd have some sort of time-traveler theory, with you jumping through portals in space.<eos> Which you didn't.<eos> Did you?<eos> Sorry.<eos> There's this whole other world going on.<eos> There really is life after high school.<eos> I got coaches across the country begging me to play for them.
Okay, first of all, Casey's little brother is an idiot.<eos> I don't know if you're aware of this or not.<eos> And apparently so is my whale, who's racked up half a million dollars and put it on my account.<eos> And I just walked in and found him with a dead stripper in his bed.<eos> Whoa, back up.<eos> You said they found a dead stripper in his bed?<eos> Yes, why do you think we're having this conversation?<eos> There is a stripper, and she's dead.<eos> Maybe the tap has something to do with the card cheaters.<eos> Hmm, it's too sophisticated for them.
So where are you with the tap situation?<eos> Can't identify the source.<eos> This has CIA written all over it.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you think Ed is in some kind of trouble?<eos> I don't know.<eos> So, you know any more about the card cheats?<eos> Uh, yeah, looks like a bunch of frat boys in town trying their version of the MIT card cheating scam.<eos> Shut down the single deck 21 pit until we can account for all of them.
We do like to avoid giving them something without getting something in return.<eos> The money was transferred to an internet casino account.<eos> That's a new one.<eos> Pretty smart,too.The funds are in carousel.<eos> There's no way to recover them without a full-scale land invasion.<eos> Oh,sorry.<eos> Okay,miss... worthington,angela worthington.<eos> Are those people going to be okay?<eos> Yeah.We're going to make sure of that.<eos> Is there anything you can tell us about them?
These things take time.<eos> Angela,if I didn't know any better, I'd say you're trying to play me now.<eos> Everybody's doing the best they can.<eos> You tell those people I want my truck.<eos> I want my jet.I want them now!<eos> He's jacked up and this is the meth talking.<eos> Listen,baby,I'm not going to lie to you.<eos> These people are hard-core and if you step out of line they are going to kill you.<eos> Oh,no,right now they are shaking their heads and freaking out,saying,"no,no,no,no,no."<eos> But that's okay.You'renot dealing with them.
It's everywhere, and it's hard not to notice.<eos> A dream is a reality rejected by our minds.<eos> A kingdom of dreams, of shadows, who cares...<eos> But it's always raining there, just like it is now.<eos> Do you, for instance, see anything special in dreams when it's raining?<eos> Dead people.<eos> It's always nothing but dead people.<eos> That's right.<eos> And it's not just you, by the way...<eos> If you die in your sleep when it's raining during the day you'll stay with them forever.
oh,my god.<eos> I failed him.<eos> sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I failed him.<eos> I sure hope you packed a lunch.<eos> It's going to be a long ride to arizona.<eos> Move your ass.<eos> Get men at all the area hospitals.<eos> Wherever they are,one of them's bleeding good.
How did you doctor my fingerprints?<eos> Don't bullshit me!<eos> Because of you, I'm in one hell of a spot.<eos> Who made you do it?<eos> Or are you doing it just for kicks?<eos> Which is it!<eos> Why target me?<eos> Why me?<eos> If you hate cops, there are lots more important guys... you can take it out on!<eos> Go after them!
Prime Minister.<eos> What's up?<eos> The Japanese seasons are wonderful!<eos> I love these pickles!<eos> Oh you do, huh?<eos> He loves pickles.<eos> Mr. Yasuizumi comes here often.<eos> I know.<eos> All the former presidents are here.<eos> He's probably keeping an eye on them.
We've always had sensitive hearts from a long long time ago<eos> We love Nippon<eos> Banzai Nippon<eos> Our Nippon<eos> The Nippon Empire<eos> The Nippon Empire<eos> GAT gave out rice balls to foreigners.<eos> To foreigners who ratted on their peers.<eos> So much for friendship!<eos> Many of them must have been innocent, but were still deported.
Beautiful.<eos> This could be the last light we'll see.<eos> Did something hit my head?<eos> What's happened?<eos> Hey, what are you all doing?<eos> There was an earthquake.<eos> An earthquake occurred and something fell on your head.<eos> It's all the earthquake's fault.<eos> Yes.<eos> This world was born with earthquakes and will disappear with them.
How'd it go with the families?<eos> Fine, fine.<eos> Really good, actually. Really good.<eos> Where's Bob?<eos> I dunno. Why do you want to know about the prions?<eos> Do you know if he sequenced the Guardsman's DNA yet?<eos> - David. - What?<eos> - Prions...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Tell me what you know about them.
Don't come back late.<eos> -You got it. See you later.<eos> -Goodbye.<eos> Fireworks Wednesday<eos> who is it?<eos> Excuse me, ma'am, your neighbors aren't answering.<eos> Do you know where they are?<eos> Their buzzer's broken.<eos> You are?<eos> I'm here to work for them.
And so I went out to the stream, looked, picked up the right rocks and sent them off to him.<eos> Four or five months later I get an e-mail from him.<eos> He said, "my son's better, now he's doing terrific" and he said, "you need to know something"<eos> he said, "we've sold over a thousand rocks at $10 a piece as gratitude rocks, and we raised all this money for charity, thank you very much".<eos> And so it's very important to be in an attitude of gratitude, as I call it.<eos> Another thing that I would suggest that you do right now to turn your life around, and this is so huge, that I can't find the words to describe just how powerful this can be for you...<eos> I took the visualization process from the Apollo programme and instituted it during the 1980's and 90's into the Olympic programme.<eos> It was called "Visual Motor Rehearsal".<eos> When you visualize, then you materialize.<eos> And the interesting thing about the mind is we took Olympic athletes and then hooked them up to sophisticated bio feedback equipment.
Are you aware of any arrangement Officer Bellick had with any inmate regarding Prison Industries?<eos> Yeah, he sold it to John Abruzzi.<eos> Officer Brad Bellick, you're terminated, effective immediately.<eos> They just announced the rewards on the TV.<eos> - How much?<eos> - $100,000 a piece.<eos> The money is just outside of Tooele, Utah.<eos> Truck!<eos> Get men in all the area hospitals.<eos> Wherever they are, one of them is bleeding good.
- In his office.<eos> I don't like starers.<eos> I wasn't staring.<eos> I was only trying to cremate him according to his wishes.<eos> As a homeless person, he would've ended up... decomposing on a slab alone somewhere until-<eos> I couldn't allow for that.<eos> But at some point during the cremation ceremony... you decided to eat your friend.<eos> We had both read the book- the account of the soccer team... that was on the plane that crashed in the Andes.<eos> The survivors had to eat some of the dead bodies... so that they could continue to survive.<eos> None of them were arrested, by the way, if you read the book.
So you have a choice.<eos> You can either spend a very, very long time in jail or you can help me out.<eos> - I'm not saying nothing.<eos> - You don't have to say anything.<eos> Write a text message.<eos> Something Pig would send to his buddies to get them all up for another fannysmackin' party.<eos> Look, Tara, I don't think that beating these people up was your idea, so why should you and Cha Cha take the fall ?<eos> These guys don't care about you.<eos> I mean, let's face it.<eos> You're just a piece of tail to them.
We believe he chooses his victims, always female, in the parking lot, probably based on the vehicle since that will be his getaway car.<eos> Watch closely.<eos> This footage was taken at the Monterey bank last Thursday.<eos> He focuses on the woman with the dog.<eos> All right... Anybody moves and she dies! Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> He gets the bank manager to open the vault... while covering everyone else,<eos> Hurry up!<eos> From here, he drags her to her vehicle, which he then takes to his own.<eos> So far, all the hostages have been released, but it's only a matter of time before one of them gets hurt.
I'm Dylan.<eos> - Zoe. - Yeah, I know.<eos> The Monday Minute ?<eos> You did see that, huh ?<eos> Don't worry, I know exactly how you feel.<eos> It's a drag when people judge you by what your parents do.<eos> Your dad's a total loser too ?<eos> Actually, he's a Nobel laureate in chemistry.<eos> Mom's a physicist.<eos> Compared to them, I'm the loser.
You were like her sister.<eos> Do you ever...feel like she's with you?<eos> In some ways, you know, like she's near you?<eos> No. Not really.<eos> Do you?<eos> I'd like to.<eos> Andrea said that you understood death in ways that most people don'T.<eos> What else did she say?<eos> Just that you knew how to help people who were grieving.<eos> Now I'm one of them.
Dark spirits.<eos> Dark spirits and light spirits are linked-- at opposite ends, obviously, and the dark spirits are here to create evil, not only create evil but to grow it.<eos> And the light spirits?<eos> The light spirits make sure that the dead pass on to the other side.<eos> The light, heaven, whatever you want to call it.<eos> They're the protectors of the souls.<eos> They, uh, they just go around spreading all things good.<eos> Love, happiness, blah blah blah.<eos> And can one dark spirit become more powerful than the others?<eos> Well, that depends on how many souls they can take up, and that's why the dark spirits hate the light spirits so much, because the light spirits are always taking souls away from them.
I'm sure a judge would be fine with that.<eos> I'll give up my bookie when you agree to pay for Stanford on your own dime.<eos> Speak to me.<eos> There was three of them.<eos> They took me into a room and grabbed my throat.<eos> I tried to scream but they held me down started ripping off my clothes.<eos> I fought back but they were too strong.<eos> Sydney, can you identify these men?<eos> They're football players.<eos> I've seen two of them before.
I mean, he would call and tell me that he wanted to come over and I know he was using me but I didn't care.<eos> I was in love with him.<eos> What happened that morning?<eos> After we had sex I told Josh I wanted a real relationship.<eos> He got mad.<eos> He said that he had an image to uphold.<eos> He said that I was a decent booty call but that he could never be seen in public with me.<eos> Why did you go to the party?<eos> To get him to change his mind.<eos> Josh wouldn't go near me. And that's when the two guys came up to me and they asked me if I wanted to party with them.

So tell me...<eos> tell me one thing.<eos> I have to know.<eos> How do you enter other people's minds?<eos> Why?<eos> Because I want to know the truth.<eos> That's all.<eos> I wonder how...<eos> Maybe it's empathy...<eos> I felt connected to them.
Is it all right if we set mass in the community center?<eos> Yeah, sure, I have no problem with that.<eos> You could tell the choir we'll be singing "In Paradisum"?<eos> I'll take care of it, Father.<eos> We sing the hymn for the dead every time we have a death.<eos> Sisters couldn't identify the victim, so we'll need you to take a look.<eos> Sorry, I didn't mean to sound cavalier It's just... we've had over half a dozen deaths this year.<eos> We've never had to close the church.<eos> That's because, in this neighborhood, those derelicts and drug addicts died of xxx overdose of all age.<eos> None of them were strung up in the rafters.
'She's started to notice her tights are baggy at the crotch. '<eos> 'All giggly, and I'm sat there with my boobs like something out of the National Geographic.<eos> 'Six cigarettes today, and all of them post-coital glorious.<eos> 'Ah, Mr Bond, I've been expecting you.<eos> 'Some people should be prohibited from wearing a thong.<eos> 'What's that girl looking at?<eos> 'I'm gonna kill them.<eos> 'I'm gonna kill them.<eos> I'm gonna kill them.<eos> 'Lay their bodies out afterwards, and lie next to them.
Look - the sun's coming up.<eos> A new day.<eos> The city'll be awake soon.<eos> All those people.<eos> All that energy.<eos> All those ghosts.<eos> We're surrounded by 'em.<eos> We can't see 'em, we can't touch 'em... ..but they're there, all right.<eos> A million shadows of human emotion.<eos> (We've just got to learn to live with them.)
It was really good at first.<eos> It was just-- he was kind of a hard guy to get close to.<eos> So I assume you've read lost delusions.<eos> It was pretty much the story of his life.<eos> Tourtured young guy too smart for his own good,doesn't really fit in.<eos> I guess I thought that I was going to be the one to bring him in from the cold.<eos> You know what?<eos> Don't ever think that you can save those tortured young artists.<eos> I think that they actually like being tortured.<eos> It's what makes them artists.
You still looking in the mirror seeing a you that ain't you?<eos> Yep.<eos> Hell, I can relate. It's called getting old.<eos> A little Botox would do us both some good.<eos> I've been blacking out.<eos> I wake up... and... things aren't...<eos> Like the time you woke up with a couple of dead thugs in your garage?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> If you think you had something to do with that...<eos> One of them was torn in half, I mean--
Ask the itinerary.<eos> "San Francisco, Phoenix, Yuma,<eos> Tucson, Carson city."<eos> Well, that doesn't make any sense.<eos> We're zigzagging back and forth.<eos> - What are we carrying?<eos> - Toys.<eos> Can you believe it?<eos> I got two bosses. Partners.<eos> One of them, Ben Glaser, he marches into the office last Tuesday and he announces that he has found religion.
Build a bungalow.<eos> Maybe I could come visit myself.<eos> NO MORE WINTERS<eos> And I grow old in that house.<eos> A hermit, in the very depths of the jungle.<eos> Every year it grows thicker.<eos> One day I won't be able to get out any more.<eos> All that remains is the memory of the outside world.<eos> And our parents...<eos> Was it the same for them?
There are more selective ways of fishing, there's a lot of waste that goes on out there.<eos> And I think one of the big reasons it continues to go on, is because we don't see it.<eos> - We know that predators are fundamental in controlling the structure and the functioning of the ecosystems.<eos> So basically if you cut off the head of the ecosystem, if you wish, the top species, the top carnivores that control a lot of the processes lower down in the food web, you're removing a really important controlling agent,<eos> and that could cause upheaval in the lower tropic levels like the plants and the zooplankton.<eos> The ocean is basically the life-support system of the planet.<eos> To change that life-support system in any major way is a risky thing.<eos> We know from the past that when oceans have changed that life on Earth has changed.<eos> I needed to know why people were killing sharks, and what I could do to stop it.<eos> So I left my job as a photographer and set out to make a film about them, but they were gone.
It appears that you know quite a bit.<eos> Know quite a bit... ?<eos> Hey, what exactly are you up to?<eos> Who knows?<eos> I'll be having that back.<eos> I see that you've changed your taste in cars.<eos> When did she... ?<eos> But this one's not bad either.<eos> Batou, I'm guessing that you're here to investigate the serial suicides of those tattooed men.<eos> A word to the wise, stay away from the Solid State society, or you'll end up killing yourself just like them.
When?<eos> It's been weeks since I've spoken to Alissa.<eos> Really?<eos> Because she was beaten with your five wood this morning.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I haven't seen those clubs in as long as I haven't seen her.<eos> So your concern is the clubs?<eos> $10,000 custom-made.<eos> She was hoarding them.<eos> If I'd have been there, I wouldn't have left without them.
I'll ask around, and get back to you as soon as I can.<eos> Thank you, Erica.<eos> Did you page me ?<eos> I'm ... sort of running with something, but, um, what's up ?<eos> Yeah, well, slow down for a second.<eos> Horatio asked me to pull some old evidence.<eos> Thought it might lead back to your eminent domain murder.<eos> Okay.<eos> What is it ?<eos> Well, there were ten reports of vandalism on Cobalt Drive in the last year, and just three of them left any evidence behind.
Well, her mother was Mexican.<eos> Then her father certainly wasn't.<eos> Based on her injuries, it appears as if the killing blow was to Marta's skull.<eos> Any tool marks?<eos> None from the skull.<eos> But there are plenty other places.<eos> The marks left some unique characteristics.<eos> You mind if I cast this?<eos> You sure do like your tools, don't you?<eos> I make my living with them.
We sure the hair wasn't wet from sweat?<eos> Maybe the weather.<eos> Nah,looked it up.<eos> -A freak snowstorm that night.<eos> -Spring in philly.<eos> Another reason we're america's vacation destination.<eos> there was a baby-sitter with iris and her brother until 8:00 P.M. That night.<eos> The parents checked on the baby when they got home.Said she was fine.<eos> Well,it leaves whoever's in the house after that.<eos> -Mom,dad.Always comes back to them.
I've been working undercover to protect you.<eos> Where's my detective?<eos> I've no idea.<eos> Who are those people back there?<eos> Possibly officers of the British security services.<eos> What is going on?<eos> !<eos> There's a plot against the Government.<eos> It's being fought on several fronts.<eos> You're one of them.
You're shocked that drugs are a part of late-night comedy?<eos> The Coneheads?<eos> Toonces the Driving Cat?<eos> You think Belushi and Farley died from Lou Gehrig's Disease?<eos> Tell me it's not happening here.<eos> It's not happening here.<eos> One night's sleep I'd like to get.<eos> What's your pitch?<eos> It'll be for August,the ultimate beach reading issue.<eos> 4.8 million readers,most of them known to marketers as "Alpha Consumers.
Honey, Dad and I don't watch Comedy Central.<eos> No.<eos> It's old.<eos> It's from vaudeville.<eos> It's the most famous piece of American comedy ever.<eos> And it was genius.<eos> Well...<eos> It was, Dad.<eos> I'm amazed that you've never...<eos> It was two guys and one of them had just bought a baseball team.
Yes, that's a good point.<eos> She has a good point.<eos> Because gay marriage, currently, is not legal under U.S. law.<eos> I bet a lot of straight men wished that applied to them.<eos> So they could go out there and have some torrid, unabashed, monkey sex.<eos> As much as they could.<eos> You know, that sounds pretty good, right ?<eos> That sounds great.<eos> Yeah, Dwight ?<eos> I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them.
Yeah, well, these guys are good.<eos> I'll give them that.<eos> If we don't get sam to flip, We have nothing but a lot of circumstantial evidence.<eos> We got dean at the crime scene with blood on his hands.<eos> Juries have convicted for less.<eos> Yeah, but, i mean, where is the murder weapon?<eos> What's the motive?<eos> You talk about reasonable doubt.<eos> Diana... do you have reasonable doubt?<eos> We keep leaning on these guys, one of them will tumble.
Just look,okay?<eos> See,brent. He likes it.<eos> I can tell.<eos> what were the harrises doing with all those fish in the basement?<eos> I promised i wouldn't say.<eos> When did this happen,doug?<eos> this was before the fire,wasn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> They didn't want to kill their own fish.<eos> So they brought them home.
HOW'D YOU KNOW I WAS IN THERE?<eos> I USED TO PLAY A LOT OF HIDE-AND-SEEK WHEN I WAS A KID.<eos> WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL THE POLICE?<eos> BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE OUT OF PLACE.<eos> BESIDES, I'M NOT FROM AROUND HERE, EITHER.<eos> WHERE ARE YOU FROM?<eos> IT'S A PLACE A LOT FURTHER THAN MEXICO.<eos> LISTEN, JAVIER, I NEED YOUR HELP.<eos> ALL THE WORKERS AT THE FARM ARE TOO SCARED TO TALK,<eos> BUT ONE OF THEM SAID THIS TO ME.
Cupcake?<eos> Only a dollar for a very good cause.<eos> Not right now, Claire Bear.<eos> You've been on the phone for an hour.<eos> Who you been talking to?<eos> Yeah, about that.<eos> You know how you've been wanting to<eos> - meet your biological parents?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I just got off the phone with them.
- Thank you, thank you very much.<eos> And feel free to say all sorts of cheeky things about me while I'm gone.<eos> Isn't she a riot?<eos> Hilarious.<eos> Well, naturally I thought they were referring to the archduke.<eos> So I jumped in, as who wouldn't?<eos> With some thoughts about the various conspiracy theories surrounding his infamous assassination in Sarajevo.<eos> Imagine my surprise when I learned that Franz Ferdinand was the name of a very popular rock-'n'-roll band.<eos> That's what he gets for trying to fraternize after class with his students.<eos> One of them even offered to burn a CD for me.
malik was 16 years old.<eos> let's be conservative and add another 19 years to that.<eos> so knock off everyone on this list under 35 years of age.<eos> and then let's cross our fingers and eliminate everyone who wasn't living in jordan during that time.<eos> how hard is that to do?<eos> wait a sec.<eos> oof. that age thing blew out all but 246.<eos> now, jordan, and the year 1992.<eos> that's going to be big.<eos> we're down to 8 guys... and one of them is... oh.
- it'S... match?<eos> Ma- matches?<eos> - Thanks,ben.<eos> - All right.<eos> Oh,more chocolate-chocolate cake?<eos> Ugh,no,I'm stuffed.<eos> They had cake at the inn for me today.<eos> so,uh,why didn't you wanna tell me what happened with jack last night?<eos> Because you would've judged me... for meeting some guy by the jukebox because that's what I do.<eos> I meet guys and I spend time with them and you would've judged me.
Oh, I don't need to taste the action.<eos> I assume it tastes like chicken.<eos> I'll tell you what I do.<eos> I'll spot you 100 bucks each, all right?<eos> Just as a thank you for signing my balls.<eos> How you doing, darling?<eos> Danny, I'm gonna do a walk and talk along the fence there.<eos> And make sure you're wide enough to see my shoes.<eos> Jack said he wanted you in there with the animals.<eos> Actually in there with them?
Sorry.<eos> Bought everyone coffee...<eos> To celebrate saving the guy's life.<eos> Yeah, I want my 20 bucks back.<eos> It's not Tyler's fault you're a dirty, dirty stripper.<eos> You heard.<eos> Everyone heard... stripper.<eos> Oh, oh, you're one to talk, Sleeping with two men.<eos> Wrong.<eos> I'm not sleeping with either one of them...
Aww, you're sweet.<eos> - Lorelai...<eos> Lorelai!<eos> Lorelai!<eos> - Okay, all right.<eos> Yes, we're gonna get up, 'cause we're in Paris, and we're gonna have a great parisian time.<eos> - We are!<eos> - Yes!<eos> Hey, is the Tour de France still going on?<eos> 'Cause we could stand on a little Paris street and yell "whoo-hoo" when the guys go by, or I could pour a cup of water on one of them as he goes whooping by.
But who's gonna answer the phones?<eos> Get an intern.<eos> Please, let it be Narciso Rodriguez.<eos> Daniel Meade's office.<eos> Daniel Meade, please.<eos> It's her.<eos> I told her I'm not taking her calls till she tells me who she is.<eos> I'm sorry, unless I can say who's calling, I'm gonna have to take a message.<eos> Oh, well, then tell Daniel we both know his father's been acting very strangely.<eos> He's a man of many secrets, and one of them is in the music box.
Daniel's been receiving nuisance phone calls from a strange woman.<eos> I assume you listen in?<eos> Yes, sir. Um... she wouldn't tell us who she is.<eos> Well, we think she might be a designer we fired a couple of years ago.<eos> She threatens to sue from time to time.<eos> Has she called recently?<eos> Yes, yes, this morning actually.<eos> Um... it didn't make much sense.<eos> Still, I'd like to know exactly what she said for certain legal reasons.<eos> Uh, well, she said that, uh, you've been acting very strangely, and you have many secrets, and one of them is in the music box.
Okay, so these are the hits, right?<eos> Here, here, and here.<eos> That's the perch.<eos> Why here?<eos> Why not here or here or here?<eos> Windage maybe or sun glare.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Or a straight shot at the construction site.<eos> Are you saying he was after the workers?<eos> Well, he could have shot anywhere, and he only shot them.
You are not GLA.<eos> You want to be, but you're not.<eos> I can't remember, um...<eos> I really want you to help me find them.<eos> Can-can you help me find him, please? Mmm.<eos> Please.<eos> Please.<eos> Caging this monster took tremendous team work by the finest men and women of law enforcement.<eos> Some of them paid the ultimate price.<eos> And we remember them today as the cloud is lifted on Los Angeles.
So, that died. Like the trend home died.<eos> Then I read in the books on inventions how Alexander Graham Bell had to make the telephone before they backed it.<eos> The Xerox machine, it had to be made completely.<eos> Edison had to make the electric lamp.<eos> Nobody backed him on the way up until after he was known.<eos> What are these for?<eos> What were these all about?<eos> These are... these are various...<eos> these are surgical instruments, aren't they?<eos> Yes, various types - and those are only some of them.
We hope to phase out the airplane by designing transportation units that can move up to two thousand miles an hour floating on a magnetic repulsive field or an air cushion.<eos> And in those huge trains of tomorrow, there'll be television, radio, amusement, art centers, classrooms;<eos> not a group of seats lined up as your trains are today.<eos> If forty or fifty people have to leave the train, we slow up to a hundred miles and hour, lift off the passenger section, or slide it off, and slide on a section with the passengers getting on.<eos> You don't have to stop the whole plane, or the train.<eos> In the future, we will just shove off those passengers getting off and that freight leaving.<eos> This is part of the linear acceleration train that can take you anywhere in the world in just a few hours.<eos> Safely without snow, rain, being lost at sea.<eos> A monorail is one of the methods of transportation.<eos> Some of them can be suspended by magnetic levitation others can use wheels and ride the rails.
Specialize in bashing skulls.<eos> Might explain the blunt-force trauma.<eos> Real interesting guy,your old man.<eos> Not the most ethical,but...<eos> interesting.<eos> He was a businessman.<eos> Sometimes you gotta play hardball.<eos> Yeah,the pinkertons were pretty handy with a bat.<eos> He ever tell you about them?<eos> Heard about that,but he didn't need them to deal with donovan.
! We know everything!<eos> We control everything!<eos> We've all worked very hard to keep our involvement in 9/11 a secret!<eos> But you just had to keep digging!<eos> R eally?<eos> You won't get away with it!<eos> People know!<eos> - People?<eos> You mean sheeple.<eos> We have the majority of them kept in blissful ignorance.
Hey, you're a loser.<eos> You like comic books, right?<eos> - No.<eos> - l got this kid, this patient.<eos> She thinks she's a superhero.<eos> What's up with that?<eos> Superhero?<eos> Well, superheroes look like anyone, like you or me.<eos> Maybe they're not someone that people necessarily notice as extraordinary, maybe in their daily life, they get walked on, but then there's a moment-- they get hit by a cosmic ray or bitten by a radioactive spider,<eos> and then suddenly, something that has been inside them all this time, lying dormant, comes raging out--
I mean escaping from prison and being on the run and the danger and the fear and the rush,all that.<eos> It,uh... it feels to me like... chasing a high.<eos> And... and I know what that's like and... I should know better by now.<eos> I never thought about it like that.<eos> I know you've heard this before, but it won't always be like this.<eos> From everything you've told me, it's just getting worse.<eos> They can't chase us forever.<eos> The guy who caught up with us today,he stops at the border,and that's why we have to get across.<eos> And I have the people in place to help us do that.<eos> We're meeting them tomorrow.
- So sorry, Mr. Batista.<eos> We had to take the psych overflow from County,<eos> - but this one's harmless.<eos> - Yeah, don't be so sure.<eos> We never take the violent ones.<eos> They have the arsonists, the rapists, the psycho killers over there.<eos> I tell you -- Those people belong in prison.<eos> Do they fingerprint psych patients at County?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Half of them don't know their own names.
I think he's trying to threaten us.<eos> Maybe he just wanted to return it.<eos> Look, he followed my wife and child to the park.<eos> I'd like you to go talk to him.<eos> Help me protect my family.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, well, give him four more ounces, and I'll be back in a half hour.<eos> All right, bye.<eos> Cell phones.<eos> How'd we ever survive without them?
Same pattern.<eos> Paint by numbers.<eos> We just found his inspiration.<eos> But why does he want us to see it?<eos> He's the one trying to bring down Sara's kidnappers, and he wants us to know it.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> Is there a reason we can't do this in the open?<eos> If my peers were to find out, I'd be killed.<eos> Peers?<eos> So you are one of them.
What if Bin Laden's merry men decide to overthrow the royal family after we give them the plutonium?<eos> He's been pretty vocal about it being his main aim in life.<eos> The plants will be built in the desert far from cities and they'll have fail-safes guarded by the British Army.<eos> Oh, well that solves everything because if the regime is overthrown, Her Majesty's Fusiliers will make a real difference.<eos> I can't imagine the Israelis will be too thrilled either.<eos> The main points of the deal are already in place.<eos> These four Saudi princes are flying in tomorrow to sort out the fine print.<eos> What does that have to do with us?<eos> Let Special Branch look after them.<eos> Six think one of them might be providing information and funding to Al-Qaeda.
For instance, I have a hard time accepting how handsome I am.<eos> You have an issue with your little brother.<eos> That's between me and Justin.<eos> He really needs you, Tommy.<eos> - Sarah, don't--<eos> OK.<eos> - Not today.<eos> So, um...<eos> We have to tell the employees.<eos> I'll take care of them.
Ever hear of a letter arriving 31 years too late?<eos> Too late for what?<eos> Save the life of a young girl.<eos> Former postman lived here?<eos> Died last week.<eos> Refused to deliver mail to blacks on his route back in '75.<eos> Welcome to the U.S.Postal service.<eos> His family found bags of mail stashed in the basement.<eos> The inspector's been sifting for hours.<eos> This was in one of them.
Hey,look,you're awake.<eos> Package from your mom.Thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Aren't you going to invite me in?<eos> So the utility closet is the new pool house.Things change.<eos> It's the Seth Ryan time that counts.<eos> I'm tired Seth.I work nights.<eos> Right,but you don't work tonight,I checked with your boss, which is why I'm inviting you to dinner with us.<eos> Just show up.Eat some food,let my parents see that you're still alive.<eos> It'd mean a lot to them,and it'd mean a lot to me.
Too noisy.<eos> Then we hit a tunnel.<eos> We thought some birds had flown in through an open window.<eos> Then came the silence.<eos> And when we came out of the tunnel, all 15 men were dead.<eos> They'd been suffocated.<eos> My squad.<eos> Men I was responsible for.<eos> But why were the men killed?<eos> About a week earlier some of them had got drunk.
No other teams were interested in picking him up because he hurt his shoulder, plus the two knee surgeries.<eos> He needed to get his game back up.<eos> He said the money he made now would need to last us the next 40 years.<eos> Was there anyone that would have wanted to hurt him?<eos> Did he have any enemies?<eos> No one stood to gain if he died.<eos> Vick was only valuable if he was playing ball.<eos> Do you know where he got the drugs?<eos> Askhis coaches.<eos> To them, he was just a piece of equipment.
He brought julia and I closer.<eos> Now you're just one big happy family.<eos> I don't expect you to understand.<eos> Okay, uh, was sadik having trouble with any rivals, other gang members, anything like that ?<eos> I just work in club.<eos> I only know sadik's men.<eos> Okay, why don't you tell me about his men.<eos> They are like dogs in the yard.<eos> They all want to be the next sadik.<eos> Some of them are less patient than others.
Two months of interrogation, that's all the CIA's been able to get out of him.<eos> There are cuts and bruises under his right eye socket.<eos> What kind of tactics are they using? I control the actions to the detainees, but I can assure you, my protest about their methods has been ignored.<eos> Let the interrogation proceed normally.<eos> I'm gonna interrupt and demand they stop harassing.<eos> Maybe I should tell them in advance.<eos> No, it's better if they don't expect it. The reaction will be more visceral, more believable.<eos> - Go ahead with phase 2 as planned.<eos> You really gonna put a show on for these guys?<eos> No, no for them.
But keep watching.<eos> You will.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't know what it's like for you.<eos> I only know what it was like for me.<eos> And for me,it was worse.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah,I didn't have any friends who were willing to risk their entire futures just so that I could get a little revenge.<eos> It's not like that.<eos> This is as much for them as it is for me.
That's what she said?<eos> Great, sweet and vulnerable is like a kitten, Landry, not a boyfriend. Well, calm down, I mean, you gotta...<eos> you gotta take what you got and work with it.<eos> You know, drop the whole quarterback macho thing. You clearly can't pull that one off.<eos> And, you know, you use the sensitive, artistic thing.<eos> So you think there actually might still be a chance that she's kind of maybe like, a little bit...<eos> Singing to your grandma may be the one thing that gets you into Julie Taylor's funhouse.<eos> Don't tell me you haven't thought about that.<eos> That's...that... that's just wrong.<eos> We're just gonna have to tell those people that they're gonna have to provide first class accommodations for us, just like we gave them when they came here, and it's as simple as that. That's what we do.
Fetch my Blackberry!<eos> That Ferrari cake must get here by midnight!<eos> Do you gentlemen need a hand?<eos> Gacy!<eos> Whatcha do that foor? !<eos> I did it for Dahmer.<eos> - For Dahmer? Yeah.<eos> He likes having' sex with dead bodies.<eos> Stop having' sex with them intestines!<eos> What good are intestines if you can't have sex with them?
Yeah, right.<eos> Baltar found her on New Caprica during the evacuation.<eos> She's on our baseship right now.<eos> From what we could gather, she was hidden at Laura Roslin's school, which means that she probably planned the whole thing in the first place.<eos> I don't need to listen to this.<eos> Watch her.<eos> They let you think that she was dead!<eos> You don't do that to a person, you do that to a thing!<eos> That's what your friends think of you, Sharon!<eos> You're not one of them!
These men are trained.<eos> Military.<eos> They weren't sneaked in here to pick cockle shells.<eos> We're going to sell nuclear plants to the Saudis?<eos> These four Saudi princes are flying in tomorrow to sort out the fine print.<eos> One of them may be providing the information and funding to Al Qaeda.
hey, rita, i gotta go.<eos> sorry, i can't talk now. i have somewhere to go.<eos> well, my brother doesn't.<eos> the youth center just fired him.<eos> are you happy?<eos> i'm not sad.<eos> he shouldn't be around kids.<eos> i saw those pictures.<eos> those boys were on his swim team.<eos> he was proud of them.
Politicians lie.<eos> And we will need a copy of his medical records.<eos> You're disgusting.<eos> How can you eat that?<eos> You see, Ziva, the human body is a finely tuned engine.<eos> None more finely tuned than mine.<eos> Even the best engine needs oil.<eos> Boss.<eos> Anything from the hotel registry?<eos> 702 names, none of them Sergeant Wright.
We have reason.<eos> They are irrational.<eos> We are controlled by intellect.<eos> They are ruled by base instinct.<eos> Please, not my son, please!<eos> Throughout our history, whenever Rome has stood up to the barbarian, we have flourished.<eos> Death to all barbarians!<eos> The massacre of barbarian families was brutal even by Roman standards.<eos> The survivors fled.<eos> Among them, thousands of barbarian soldiers who had deserted the Roman Army.
No.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Sure you do.<eos> It's not your fault, it's society.<eos> A guy can sleep with as many girls as he wants.<eos> A girl does it, she's a slut.<eos> There's three guys in that picture.<eos> AMBER: Oh, relax.<eos> I put this up for my social taboo class to see how people would respond.<eos> I didn't sleep with them all.
Where's the ship now ?<eos> It's being towed to Seattle.<eos> - I have to go there.<eos> - Clark, these guys aren't just meteor freaks.<eos> They're from galaxies far, far away.<eos> And, more importantly, they can hurt you.<eos> You can't go unarmed.<eos> I won't.<eos> I have the crystal that Raya gave me.<eos> I'll use that against them.
Please, what happened to Lex ?<eos> I took him, and if you ever want to see him again, you'll keep your mouth shut and listen to exactly what I have to say.<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> Just don't hurt him.<eos> Do you know your boyfriend has a secret lab hidden inside Luthor Corp tower called 33.1 ?<eos> Why is it secret ?<eos> Because they run experiments on the people who have been infected by the meteor rocks.<eos> When patients are released from Belle Reve, instead of freedom, they get a one-way ticket to a secret laboratory.<eos> How do you know all this ?<eos> 'Cause I was one of them... till I broke out last night.
All right.<eos> Well, as soon as April gets here, we're gonna have to run, 'cause we're gonna miss the movie.<eos> - I'm feeling you.<eos> - Stop feeling me.<eos> So, business has been going like gangbusters.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm destroying those Stars Hollow middle school kids.<eos> Destroying.<eos> Outselling them by three or four times.
I wasn't just being cancelled out by Joy.<eos> * They paved paradise, put up a parking lot * I was being cancelled out by everyone.<eos> * With a pink hotel, a boutique And a swinging hot spot * So I spent a couple days trying to get people to open their eyes.<eos> But most just didn't want to listen.<eos> Hey !<eos> * They paved paradise, put up a parking lot * And the people who did listen didn't seem to care.<eos> Look, pal, they're putting a cell phone tower in here.<eos> - Trees have got to go, I'm sorry.<eos> - A cell phone tower ?<eos> But trees make air, and look, there's a bird living in one of them.

It's just my crazy nose.<eos> I... um, I'm used to different smells.<eos> Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in metropolitan Orlando.<eos> It's made from real pine.<eos> Who's Bob Vance?<eos> You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie.<eos> I don't know who this new people think they are.<eos> I have sat down windows to Philly's stinky perfume for years.<eos> Never said a word.<eos> People hate people that are different from them.
OK, the satellite's re-aligned but we only have seven minutes before it passes out of range.<eos> Switching to thermal imaging...<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> Adam?<eos> Can we get their comms?<eos> Either they don't have any or they're on radio silence.<eos> Malcolm? Do you have a visual?<eos> Five people have just entered the building in a military formation.<eos> One of them is standing guard outside.
I just thought you might want to join me out here.<eos> They said it's okay.<eos> Come on.<eos> Can I get you a water?<eos> Sara, I know how hard it must be to know you were living a lie.<eos> But it doesn't mean you have to give up.<eos> I'm not giving up.<eos> The physical conditioning you've been subjected to, the advanced facility you're in, the level of organization around you...<eos> Why would they go to this much trouble if they thought you were going to leave anytime soon?<eos> Why would these people show you their faces, if they thought you'd ever turn against them?
No idea.<eos> We grew up in care.<eos> Like a children's home?<eos> I haven't got anyone else either.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> My parents are dead, so I came down here to start afresh.<eos> So they didn't leave you a house or anything?<eos> No.<eos> I've got nothing.<eos> Were you close to them?

He came here to play basketball, and it's worked for him.<eos> A year ago, he walked on as a junior.<eos> Now, he's averaging 18 points a game, and recruiters are calling after him.<eos> What about the team?<eos> Any enemies?<eos> I really can't say.<eos> Can't or won't?<eos> My players aren't the reason Ted went missing.<eos> But if he were trouble, they might know something about it.<eos> You'll have to take that up with them then.
Really?<eos> What?<eos> Seeing all those cocky high school kids visiting campus.<eos> People throwing them parties, giving them special treatment.<eos> And there you are, carrying a full load with 50 grand in student loans.<eos> It isn't fair.<eos> I hear ya.<eos> It's not.<eos> Especially when those athletes are getting a free ride.<eos> The University just rolls out the red carpet for them.
You got an I.D.?<eos> It's cool.<eos> Cover's 20 bucks, just pay inside.<eos> Cool.<eos> Sorry, boys, not tonight.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> I'm sorry, is there a problem with their I.D.'s?<eos> Because they're with me.<eos> There's a problem with them.
It's right off Route 123 in Fairfax.<eos> Go,McGee.<eos> I'll keep working on back-tracing the guy who sent him there.<eos> Clear!<eos> They took our chip,boss.<eos> Hey,McGee,when I told you to put this car back together I didn't mean put it back together with the only piece of evidence we have on the killer.<eos> I didn't.<eos> We put in a copy. Abby's got the original.<eos> Otto has five stereo cameras.<eos> Hoping one of them got a picture of our guy.
You like Krista Palmer just a little bit there, Frank ?<eos> She's an awesome athlete, so what ?<eos> Is that why you were at the rink after hours, to watch her ?<eos> No, I was there 'cause those broomball players gave me a hundred bucks to keep the lights on, prop the side door open.<eos> Then I went across the street. Got a drink.<eos> And you zamboni the ice before or after that ?<eos> After.<eos> When I got back.<eos> And when you got back,the rink was empty ?<eos> Yeah,the broomball players weren't there yet, so I figured I'd soften up the ice for them.
Sneaking up unnoticed is impossible.<eos> Perhaps fortune will favour the bold.<eos> The colony is well-defended. There are no easy pickings here.<eos> She's driven away from every nest, but hunger compels her to continue.<eos> There are more eggs here than she can possibly eat now.<eos> But the nesting season is short.<eos> So she stashes much of her plunder for later in the year when all the geese have gone.<eos> Further south, other bigger predators prowl the tundra.<eos> Wolves.<eos> For them, finding food on the plains is an even greater challenge.

But I'm not going to school today.<eos> Oh really?<eos> You can't make me go.<eos> I can I'm your mother, they gave me permission at the hospital when I had you.<eos> Mom I have to stay home.<eos> Amy Hampson is gonna beat me up.<eos> Wait a second, who's Amy Hampson?<eos> She's this girl in my biology class.<eos> Somebody passed her this not by mistake and... I guess the boys wrote it.<eos> It's a list of who's hot and who's not, and according to them I'm hot.
By order of the secretary of defense to george anson blane, a sergeant in the 347th regimental combat team, on the night of october 10-11, 1952, at the risk of his life and under massive enemy fire,<eos> advanced upon and destroyed an enemy tank on hill 242 po chin, korea, his actions saving the life of his platoon, and contributed greatly to the success of the subsequent counterattack.<eos> For action in the highest tradition of the armed services, george anson blane is hereby awarded the silver star.<eos> Congratulations, sir.<eos> Thought it was your boss tonight.<eos> Personal business.<eos> How's your boyfriend?<eos> I don't understand men.<eos> Well, you know, they're just like women.<eos> If you're nice to them, they like you; if you shoot them, they die.
Look, you got a great backhand, but, uh, no offense,<eos> I kind of have a "no jail bait" policy.<eos> Lame.<eos> You know, maybe you should try, uh, try meeting guys from your school.<eos> - You mean boys?<eos> - Exactly<eos> Yeah, because you're in high school.<eos> You know, that place with desks and chalkboards and kids.<eos> Those are people your own age.<eos> I don't know, maybe... maybe you should try hanging out with them.
--Because you don't want to introduce me to your friends?<eos> --Don't be ridiculous.<eos> What about the woman on the street?<eos> That woman on the street is not anyone you have to worry about.<eos> She's a closet republican.<eos> --Okay.<eos> So why don't you bring me to the party?<eos> --Because i just... i don't think... i don't think you'll fit in with these people.<eos> They're horrible.<eos> I know. I'm one of them.
He's been catching killers for what, 30 years?<eos> Now, you spent a couple hours with the guy, and all of a sudden you're bringing up his most famous setback.<eos> He's bound to get a little testy.<eos> What does he have to get testy about?<eos> Agent Cooper led the police right to Richard Gomez.<eos> He did his job.<eos> It's not his fault somebody lost the evidence.<eos> You're right, but maybe Cooper doesn't see it that way.<eos> Catching these people is pretty much a crusade for him, right?<eos> So when one of them slips away, I doubt he spends much time consoling himself with the idea that he is not personally to blame.
My husband,um,their father,was killed when he tried to stop a robbery<eos> Derek was with him,he was ten<eos> A year or so later,he started getting into trouble<eos> What kind of trouble<eos> He started running around with older kids<eos> They would give him money to run errands for them<eos> Not drugs<eos> No,derek would never disgrace his father's name<eos> But they were gangbangers<eos> So people started looking at derek like he was one of them
It is ambushed nearthe village.<eos> 7 Germans die in a fierce struggle.<eos> The Hauptsturmfuehrer orders aretreat to take revenge for the ambush with aretaliatory measure in Distomo.<eos> First the twelve hostages are shot before the villagers' eyes. It is early evening, half past 5.<eos> At some point, they put me on the window sill or a chair so that I could look outside.<eos> I saw that something was installed opposite the school, something similar to a cannon. It started spewing fire.<eos> It was clearly the moment when we realised: something's happening.<eos> The German soldiers search all streets ofthe village.<eos> They start breaking down doors.<eos> The villagers try to hide, among them two of Argyris's cousins.
Got it.<eos> Ibraha! I can't hear you!<eos> Hurry and get down here!<eos> Takenaka! Where are you?<eos> Basilan?<eos> Hey! Our diversion team is there!<eos> Don't panic.<eos> I'm at their camp.<eos> The lighthouse's base is always the darkest.<eos> We're waiting here for the first blow among the local guerillas, but... it's the same for them too.
This sense that Victorian certainties were ebbing away as they were at the high point.<eos> It's a conscious turning one's back on what's become the modern world.<eos> (W00D ) Freedom fighter, superman, Christian hero and now head of the first British Empire.<eos> A tired giant, whose noble ideals slip through his fingers.<eos> But a figure who united the British in a mystical vision of their past.<eos> A fantasy, but somehow, like all the best myths, still true.<eos> (TANN0Y) A no-smoking policy is now operated on all interior accommodation.<eos> So you see this great mass of legends and stories about King Arthur grew and was added to over hundreds of years.<eos> Responding to the times, to needs that were political and cultural and even emotional.<eos> You can see too that most of them have no origin in real historical events.
Its roots lie in an ancient legend and in a tantalising cluster of rumours which surfaced in the 16th century.<eos> (HORNS HONK)<eos> The rumours surfaced here in India.<eos> The path which leads to Shangri-La begins in the north Indian city of Agra, in the 16th century, the capital of the Mogul empire.<eos> In those days, India was the centre of the world, the emperor, Akbar the Great, as powerful as any king on earth.<eos> A Muslim who ruled a Hindu empire,<eos> Akbar was fascinated by the ancient myths of Hindu India.<eos> He sent an expedition to find the source of the sacred River Ganges, which legend said fell from heaven.<eos> When the expedition returned to Agra, Akbar's court heard fantastic tales of an unknown land beyond the Himalayas.<eos> His Christian guests were astonished to hear about a kingdom where the people worshipped a saviour and had monks and monasteries, like them.
But it must've been much worse for the first seeker, the Jesuit Andrade, sick and snow-blind, in agonies of frostbite.<eos> "It took us 20 days to get into Tibet," he says,<eos> "because ranges of terrible mountains blocked the way.<eos> "Every day around four o'clock, the snow came in," he says,<eos> "and we lost all feeling in our hands and feet.<eos> "There was no firewood and worst of all," Andrade writes, "was the biting wind."<eos> The only food they got in the mountains, he says, was roast barley meal, which they mixed with water.<eos> That was all they had, just like the Tibetan nomads.<eos> We're a bit like that ourselves tonight because our horses have not caught up with us and it's already quite late.<eos> Our sleeping bags and our food and pretty much everything is with them, so we're going to have a cold and hungry night.
We have a job to do, Anakin.<eos> Try not to upset him.<eos> Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.<eos> Not this time.<eos> And this time, you won't escape.<eos> Crush them!<eos> Make them suffer!<eos> Stay at your stations!<eos> Run!<eos> Don't bother with them.
Training?<eos> An old friend has learned the path to immortality.<eos> One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force.<eos> Your old master.<eos> Qui-Gon?<eos> How to commune with him I will teach you.<eos> - Captain Antilles.<eos> - Yes, Your Highness?<eos> I'm placing these droids in your care.<eos> Treat them well.
We were sad to hear of it.<eos> Oh... so young to succeed to a title.<eos> We will kiss you.<eos> You look well, my Lady Essex.<eos> Perhaps you're in search of new offers of marriage.<eos> She has an eye for you, Leicester.<eos> Oh, the portraits of your ancestors<eos> - look well on your walls, my lord.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Pity so may of them proved to be traitors.
Gold!<eos> Jake, come on!<eos> Pay dirt, boys.<eos> Gold!<eos> Gold!<eos> Gold!<eos> Officially, the Army sent Custer into Black Hills to map out the site of a new fort to protect the northern railroad, and though the gold he'd found didn't amount to more than a 50-cent diggin',<eos> it wasn't long before the newspapers proclaimed the place "the El Dorado of America."<eos> Every day, immigrants came in hope of striking their fortune.<eos> Like so many before them, most brought only their dreams and the clothes on their backs.
Four rails to the minute.<eos> Three strokes per spike, ten spikes per rail.<eos> Four hundred rails to the mile.<eos> It's 1,800 miles to San Francisco.<eos> Twenty-one million times they got to swing those hammers.<eos> Listen to that sound.<eos> That's money. Money.<eos> It won't be long before this enterprise gets beyond the reach of any town.<eos> And men deprived of their diversions are inclined to get restless.<eos> So if they can't come to town, why, then the town will just have to come to them.
That is, if you'll allow me, father.<eos> Of course I'll allow you.<eos> Business isn't as it was, bank failures and all.<eos> People barter for services nowadays, but we'll get by.<eos> Bunk here until things turn for the better.<eos> Your squaw feel the same?<eos> Now don't call her my squaw.<eos> She's my wife, my woman, my missus.<eos> There ain't nothin' dirty about it.<eos> I lived with her people, hunted buffalo with them.

up above the world so high like a diamond in the sky...<eos> Nature's unforgiving tempest and my own ruins conspired to defeat my purpose, and so I became a creature of the wilderness, not a soul to answer to.<eos> I trapped. I hunted. I survived.<eos> Cheyenne Winter Camp<eos> [Speaking natvie language]<eos> [Speaking natvie language]<eos> [Speaking natvie language]<eos> The mountains claimed my company for 2 seasons, and eventually they claimed my mind.<eos> The eyes of my children haunted me, haunted me because I knew their little eyes still held hope that they would see me again.<eos> Sometimes I lost control when I remembered their faces and the life I wanted to live with them.
Luckily I had a key,... so I came in and I found him here.<eos> Just like he is now.<eos> I had to dump a few things to avoid problems with the cops.<eos> He took a whole mixture.<eos> He always did,... but this time he put in everything.<eos> You weren't living here?<eos> I put up with everything.<eos> With everything.<eos> His bad spells, not having any money...<eos> When he became an activist with the veterans,... when he fought with them.
I love thatjoke.<eos> David Bowers...<eos> A very early joke that David Bowers, storyboard artist, did.<eos> And I'm so proud of lan's animation on the Were-Rabbit here.<eos> We really wanted him to have that feeling of a sort of Ray Harryhausen, - Willis O'Brien, furry monster. - Yeah.<eos> A monster with a character.<eos> We could have done it OGI, but we couldn't have found the money to do it 'cause it's so expensive.<eos> We wanted it to have that vintage King Kong quality.<eos> I love this joke with the rabbits.<eos> There's no reason for them to have...
I found somehow you're always looking for the obvious way to do your idea, that you start off in the most abstract ways but you're constantly looking for that route that everyone's gonna get it even if the idea is quirky.<eos> It's like a real mixture of conforming, but not conforming.<eos> It's the hardest thing, really, 'cause we were very strong about what we felt about the whole film and what...<eos> the kind of story we wanted to tell.<eos> And so many people come in, and often their comments, you know...<eos> Quite often people's comments are very irritating a lot of the way 'cause they're constantly criticizing every little thing that you're doing.<eos> You're so grateful because you're glad someone's had the courage to tell you something isn't working when it's not working. I mean, I... Gosh.<eos> It's my first feature film and I find it so challenging and, you know, often difficult to be so heavily criticized.<eos> But I can truthfully say that itjust would not be as good as it is if it weren't for people doing that.<eos> Whether you agree with them... I think often...
I'll be finished in a few minutes.<eos> When I say guests, it's a euphemism. I mean clients, as in "people who pay".<eos> If I remember correctly, clients keep us waiting, not the other way around.<eos> I'm almost done.<eos> I don't think you're catching my drift.<eos> You work here so you can study your silly animals who don't exist anymore.<eos> I work here so I can grow rich and fat and own everything that does happen to exist.<eos> I hired you because you're this big deal scientist and clients pay more for a big deal anything, it makes them feel important.<eos> Rotten, I know.<eos> But progress is a rotten business, which is why you have to go out there and mingle with them.
Please withdraw for now, sir.<eos> Let me talk to them<eos> All right do it, do it!<eos> Listen up<eos> This is corporal Bhola Tiwari speaking<eos> Colonel Mitchell sahib has agreed to withdraw the cannons<eos> The English soldiers are returning to their barracks<eos> Please let them through<eos> Fellow soldiers of India... we have shed our blood without complaint... in the service of our foreign masters<eos> For them, we have conquered kingdom after kingdom
We begin with lobster bisque.<eos> You embarrass me.<eos> You ridicule me!<eos> You insult me in front of my guests.<eos> These people are Parisians.<eos> They tried to blind Cavaldi with their fairy tales and devouring trees and flying wolves.<eos> But I use my logical brain, Generale.<eos> I can make this as clear as crystal.<eos> I am in no way responsible.<eos> It is them.
I am Folsom Prison.<eos> At one time they called me "Bloody Folsom."<eos> And I earned the name.<eos> My own prisoners built me.<eos> Every block of my granite is cemented by the blood of many men.<eos> Is it any wonder a man sometimes went berserk and fought the hated walls that shut him in?<eos> Knock it off!<eos> You knock it off and get to sleep!<eos> This was a common thing in those old days.<eos> I had so little work for them to do...
The desires for food and water, shelter and companionship, freedom of movement and avoidance of pain?<eos> these desires are shared by nonhuman animals and human beings.<eos> As for comprehension: like humans, many nonhuman animals understand the world in which they live and move.<eos> Otherwise, they could not survive.<eos> So beneath the many differences, there is sameness.<eos> Like us, these animals embody the mystery and wonder of consciousness.<eos> Like us, they are not only in the world, they are aware of it.<eos> Like us they are the psychological centers of a life that is uniquely their own.<eos> In these fundamental respects humans stand "on all fours", so to speak, with hogs and cows, chickens and turkeys.<eos> What these animals are due from us, how we morally ought to treat them, are questions whose answer begins with the recognition of our psychological kinship with them.
I was under the impression that I was the clever bastard before I went in, but these boys were a completely different class. Head tricksters of the premier division.<eos> Their sole ambition was to create the ultimate con and win the ultimate game, always thinking quicker, always thinking bigger.<eos> Gradually they thought they'd found a formula to the con.<eos> Check.<eos> A formula to win the ultimate win.<eos> The formula.<eos> I couldn't understand the depth of it, but they were confident it was real, and I believed them.<eos> After all, they'd been right on everything else. So now they felt they'd had their moment and it was time for them to leave the confines of their cell.<eos> The concrete and steel wasn't even mentioned.<eos> I didn't even doubt them. They got whatever they wanted anyway. You could smell their food through 12 inches of concrete.

They swore to me...<eos> "You're coming with us, Jake."<eos> I trusted them.<eos> Never for a second did I doubt them.
You know the rules... the longer you listened, the sweeter the pitch.<eos> He's got all the tricks and all the right answers.<eos> Don't let them do this to you, Jake.<eos> Don't let them turn you against you.<eos> You don't give because it's good.<eos> You give because it hurts him.<eos> Everything all right, Mr. D?<eos> It will be when you take care of my security, Paul.<eos> What are you holding the papers for?<eos> Because you're on the cover of half of them.
You're quite good at this game, Mr. Green.<eos> I know, 'cause I'm quite good at this game.<eos> Check.<eos> Check.<eos> Check.<eos> The art is for me to feed pieces to you and make you believe you took those pieces 'cause you're smarter and I'm dumber.<eos> Wake up, Mr. Green.<eos> You can't see what's right in front of you.<eos> I never saw or spoke to those boys in all those years.<eos> You know, I'd have died for either one of them.
No, bigger than that.<eos> There's a god damned psychopath on the loose in Vallejo.<eos> He shot two more kids.<eos> No, we missed the morning edition. It'll be in the afternoon's.<eos> You want the story first? You've gotta let me do it...<eos> on the morning show.<eos> That's right.<eos> Yeah, I'll be there. Alright.<eos> In what appears to be the second murderous assault on young lovers in less than a year.<eos> A Vallejo couple was viciously attacked last night and I'm saddened to report that one of them has died.
Hands on your head.<eos> Find the paper.<eos> Speak and she dies.<eos> - You're coked up.<eos> - But. Officer...<eos> - Open the trunk.<eos> - Here's the papers. here.<eos> Miss.<eos> Me?<eos> You with them?
OK.<eos> Go down.<eos> Keep going.<eos> Cocksucker.<eos> You rich are just asking to be killed.<eos> - See the stairs with the kids?<eos> - Yes.<eos> All right. Go all the way down those stairs.<eos> There are some lockers down there.<eos> one of them's your tasty daughter's.
They're sad because there's no one up there.<eos> No pork, just beans.<eos> No sausage for your country breakfast.<eos> No condiments for your meat.<eos> No relish, no sauce.<eos> Lou's so small.<eos> Ask me how small he is?<eos> How small is he?<eos> Lou's so small his last girlfriend... was a pencil sharpener.<eos> Lou's so small he doesn't get crabs, he dates them.
Actually it's almost been a year Michael, besides my parents got married on the third date... and they're still together.<eos> Well you're only as monogamous as your options.<eos> I mean your parents live in a trailer park in a field.<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Only as monogamous as their options!<eos> You know it gets worse Michael, I'm going to ask him to move in.<eos> Oh my God!<eos> I knew this day was going to come.<eos> You know you said you needed a place to crash for the night... and you've been living on my couch for five years.<eos> Jesus, Michael, be happy for them.
At that wedding, was a woman involved?<eos> Of course it involved a woman.<eos> If she's not a woman, it's gonna be a surprise to both of us. Hello!<eos> - I'll tell you, this is going to be some party.<eos> Twenty-five years of marriage.<eos> - More power to you, pal. - Thank you.<eos> - Hey, baby.<eos> - Sorry I'm late.<eos> My vice principal called in sick today... so it was just me against 208 middle-schoolers.<eos> I swear half of them ate pure sugar for breakfast.
I haven't.<eos> Impressive.<eos> We have purged your fear.<eos> You are ready to lead these men.<eos> You are ready to become a member of the League of Shadows.<eos> But first, you must demonstrate your commitment to justice.<eos> I'm no executioner.<eos> Your compassion is a weakness your enemies will not share.<eos> That's why it's so important.<eos> It separates us from them.
He had already died when my daughter was born.<eos> What was he looking for in the sand?<eos> My husband was crazy.<eos> What about you?<eos> Those men are scientists.<eos> I'm just helping them get around.<eos> Scientists?<eos> That's right.<eos> Where are they from?<eos> Some of them are Americans, English.
We return after a word from our sponsors.<eos> What was that?<eos> Funny, isn't it?<eos> We're having fun while the world is falling apart.<eos> What are you going to do now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just know I'm against this war.<eos> I wasn't born to kill people.<eos> My biggest fear was losing my documents.<eos> Without them, I'd be nothing in Brazil.
Don't be afraid.<eos> Good!<eos> A horse is your wings.<eos> A good horse is your best friend.<eos> In difficult times it will help you defeat your enemy.<eos> I gathered them from all parts of the Kazakh steppe.<eos> I picked only the best, each from a different tribe.<eos> They all worked hard to become true Kazakh warriors, but two boys did everything better than the others -<eos> Mansur and his best friend Erali.<eos> I was the only one who knew that one of them was the son of Sultan Wali.
Hurry up. Hurry, now.<eos> We've gotta get it unloaded.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Just let it go.<eos> No, no.<eos> No, five of them.<eos> Go.<eos> Don't worry about that.<eos> Don't let the zebras run.<eos> Stay with them.
-I'm Stripes.<eos> You don't say?<eos> -Are you a racehorse?<eos> -No, I'm a jumper.<eos> I've actually competed all around the world.<eos> Well, I'm a racehorse.<eos> I'm training to be in the big race.<eos> By racing the mailman?<eos> Well, the other horses don't wanna race me.<eos> -I'm just way too fast for them.

Here,<eos> The drawer in the desk in my dad's office,<eos> What's in there?<eos> Now?<eos> - Good morning,<eos> - Please, don't yell, Please,<eos> - Are you all right?<eos> - Theoretical physicists,<eos> - What happened?<eos> Thanks a lot for leaving me alone with them,
So, what are you doing here, Mr. Palmer?<eos> Well, you know, when I was a kid, I went to a Jimi Hendrix concert and this pawn shop here has got a '68 Stratocaster, the same guitar he used to play.<eos> And the guy won't sell it to me.<eos> This guy look familiar to you?<eos> Maybe from back in your Brooklyn days?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's Joe Lupino.<eos> Joe Loop.<eos> Is that his head shot?<eos> Couple's in Griffith Park last night, two dudes pulled in, one of them's wearing one of those pimp hats, they pop the trunk, toss out a body that's been worked over by a baseball bat.
It ain't running right now, and my tow truck ain't here so unless you stick it up your ass...<eos> Hey, one way or another, grease monkey tomorrow I'm auctioning off this hunk of junk.<eos> So y'all have a good night, now, okay?<eos> I got two words for you:<eos> soap and water.<eos> That's three words.<eos> Stupid.<eos> Hey, man, this is Cooter.<eos> Round up the fellas.<eos> I got a job for them.
Oh, thank you.<eos> Mmm!<eos> Apple!<eos> My favorite!<eos> You can make yourself at home.<eos> I'll be back in a second.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You must think we're pretty crazy keeping all these toys around.<eos> It's, um...<eos> It's hard to find the right place for them, you know?
- Where?<eos> - Here. Let me show you something.<eos> The bouncers here, they're no good.<eos> Now listen to that.<eos> In the bar of my dreams, Mr. Matsuda... I'd have the best team of bouncers in town... and in the whole of Asia.<eos> They'd be hand-picked, and they'd be well trained.<eos> Only then can you have control.<eos> See that?<eos> The bouncers are like your dials, you know.<eos> You control the mood with them.
We've got to get out of here, man.<eos> I mean, these people, they kill anybody.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Have you lost your senses?<eos> - There was something else!<eos> There was a letter!<eos> Look, you're a lunatic.<eos> Do you know what you're doing?<eos> You're killing us both.<eos> We'll take our chances with them.
I wasn't exactly what they were looking for in a child.<eos> I wasn't normal.<eos> Quick.<eos> What's 5,589 times 3,972 divided by 17?<eos> 1,305,853 point 411 etc. See?<eos> I told you.<eos> You know, when McDonald's says 13 billion served... it's not that much. 0nly 43 visits per person, per year... which is once every 8,49... days.<eos> It turns out you can't control people... or even predict them.<eos> But numbers are different.<eos> As I use to say, you can count on them.
Bab'Aziz, hurry up!<eos> It's them!<eos> We've arrived!<eos> They are dervishes, but we haven't arrived yet.<eos> Bab'Aziz, I've swallowed some sand.<eos> You bear the angel's mark.<eos> What is the angel's mark, Bab'Aziz?<eos> Babies in their mother's womb know all the secrets of the universe.<eos> Butjust before they're born an angel comes and puts his finger on their mouth so that they forget everything.<eos> As a souvenir of this lost knowledge, some of them, like you, have a mark on their chin.
If you called me an "old fart," l'd kill the piece.<eos> You're not Prime Minister.<eos> And you hate him, too.<eos> The problem isn't hating him, it's writing it.<eos> Do you hold things back?<eos> She's right.<eos> I only slam movies, she puts down the world!<eos> C'mon! Let's go!<eos> without my friends?<eos> With them, I feel 1 7 again, free as a bird.

Mr. Purvis you comprehend... what I'm saying to you, but I have no power over you.<eos> It's the same with them.<eos> We understand each other.<eos> They're just like you and me.<eos> She must be pregnant.<eos> It's uncanny how the baboons can sense a pregnancy.<eos> Are you absolutely sure?<eos> - It's not cast-iron proof...<eos> If we could have a fetus from the female, it's perfect... and this is ideal.<eos> We don't need them anymore.
No, no.<eos> You know what the problem is? That we criminals got rights, baby.<eos> That's right.<eos> We got rights to be protected against assault under any circumstances.<eos> If you can't provide that, well, fuck you... we will.<eos> You're a fuckin' psycho.<eos> Jesus Christ, Jake!<eos> What? Are you gonna trust these freaks? Huh?<eos> The first chance they get to blow our brains out, they'll try to make a break for it.<eos> They need us as much as we need them.
Look at you. Shh.<eos> Shh. It's okay. I told these firemen.<eos> They're not leavin' us alone. Not for a second.<eos> Okay?<eos> All right.<eos> Help me up.<eos> We have some questions for you, Sergeant.<eos> I'd like to get this wound looked at first.<eos> Anybody else out there?<eos> No, man. There's nobody else. Just me and... and them.
Look !<eos> As soon as we give them the arms, those people are going to die.<eos> It's not our business.<eos> They killed a boy just now as young as Nicky.<eos> - What is the hold up ?<eos> It's what we always know, you can't control what they do.<eos> No, today we can !<eos> They're right there !<eos> They'll kill us if we back out.<eos> And ifwe go ahead, what do you think they'll do to them ?
All right, listen... when she gets back, you tell her I have that present... that I mentioned for her earlier and not to leave. Okay?<eos> Bye.<eos> Mr. Arglist.<eos> Councilman.<eos> I wonder if we might have a quiet word.<eos> Actually, I'm kind of...<eos> Would you be good enough to deliver a message from me to Mr. Guerrard?<eos> Wichita is a community of good people, Mr. Arglist.<eos> Christian people.<eos> Yeah, half of them are in this very bar trying to get laid.
- Sithandra.<eos> - Let's keep moving.<eos> - We understand these now?<eos> - Completely.<eos> I'd keep off the grass.<eos> - Rendezvous at 1620.<eos> - I'll be waiting.<eos> I agree with the policy of targeting proven Monican threats.<eos> But I'm afraid we're going too far.<eos> We can't go too far with them.
-tell me who, Señor Agustin. tell me.<eos> God, it's them.<eos> You brought them here!<eos> Señor Agustin.<eos> No!<eos> You did all you could, Mr. Robinson.<eos> You are a hero.<eos> A hero would have saved him.<eos> Two assailants, one male, one female.<eos> Anything you can remember about them?
It's "Dragon's Lair."<eos> Brian came by yesterday and dropped it off.<eos> He said it wasn't as good as the real thing but at least it'd keep me practicing.<eos> He helped me get to level 10 the one where the castle's under siege.<eos> That's cool.<eos> He's a pretty decent guy, Brian is.<eos> Yeah, he is.<eos> Oh, man, you were right, and I was wrong, but I'm....<eos> I'm wrong about most people, so....<eos> The important thing is you always change your mind about them.
I think we'll take some time to consider it.<eos> Court is adjourned until 9:30 tomorrow morning.<eos> - You can't find him?<eos> - I went to meet him, he didn't show.<eos> I called his office, I called his house.<eos> Go to the hospital, ask around.<eos> Somebody's gotta know where he is.<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> Tell Father Moore I'm sorry.<eos> Tell him I know the demons are real and I admire his courage for standing and speaking against them.
So, you mull it over and I'll talk to you soon.<eos> - All right, I will. Thank you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> What's up, dawg? What happened?<eos> How was the date with Trish?<eos> - It was a disaster.<eos> - Really?<eos> Yes. I've never been more embarrassed in my life.<eos> Couldn't get the condoms to work.<eos> And one of them exploded on my balls.
I put that in 'cause it's a nice shorthand for a contemporary audience to see what the culture was like back then.<eos> Robert Zemeckis and I were concerned when I was writing this script that young women and young men in their 20's, early 30's,<eos> would have no concept of what the '50s were like and what the social mores were.<eos> And he actually suggested that I start looking into old TV clips to give those cues.<eos> I have very few scenes where Evelyn and Kelly are alone together, mostly because when you live with an alcoholic, they usually pass out before you get to bed.<eos> And I thought this would be such an intimate way of showing their relationship, of him removing her milk-sodden girdle.<eos> And also we get a chance to see Evelyn in a really raw emotional state,<eos> because she couldn't afford to show this to her kids.<eos> Herjob, her entire life, was to make sure every one of those kids got out of that house emotionally whole.<eos> And if she fell apart in front of them,
Where are your clothes?<eos> And what's that?<eos> Give it to me!<eos> Those are dangerous.<eos> Take them back to the kitchen.<eos> Go!<eos> Go on, off with you!<eos> Get back to bed before you catch cold.<eos> You must rest.<eos> Charlotte, dearest. Look after them, will you?
Are you sure you don't want a drink?<eos> - No, no.<eos> It took some getting used to after my mother died.<eos> It really wasn't easy for us.<eos> How are you now?<eos> - Everything's all right.<eos> Just fine.<eos> That's the neighbours.<eos> Really strange people.<eos> Maybe you have a foster home for them?
Oh! Fine. Thank you.<eos> Now, shall we begin?<eos> Gentlemen on the blue line, ladies on the pink line.<eos> In my class, you will learn some of the latest dance steps:<eos> the waltz, the swing, the cha-cha-cha.<eos> This sucks.<eos> But tonight, you will learn my favorite, the box step.<eos> And boys, when we are serving punch to our ladies, be sure to keep your fingers out of the cup.<eos> It is very improper.<eos> And ladies, when the young gentlemen ask you to dance, dance with them, even if you don't want to.
Mrs Shaukat Vashist shouldn't be doing<eos> Let go Antara.<eos> Let go.<eos> You're in love with me, aren't you?<eos> - Don't you believe that?<eos> I do, but maybe you don't.<eos> Because you're afraid<eos> Of falling in love. - That will never happen<eos> If you keep running away from people, it'll never happen<eos> But the real test is to meet people, mingle with them.. and prove it
Oh, Paddy's her name.<eos> Well, that's reason number three.<eos> -Did you ever ride a man, Lukie?<eos> -No, but I rode a man that did.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> -Evening.<eos> -How you doing?<eos> Mikey, go get the lads.<eos> I'm warning you, get out of here!<eos> Fuck them and their Rob Strong.
No. Excuse me, please.<eos> -Open his eyes.<eos> -What do you see, bro?<eos> -Sausages.<eos> No stars?<eos> Stars and sausages.<eos> Now you're talking.<eos> Gotta get behind the surface.<eos> Yes, surface.<eos> I see four green fields, Brits in one of them.
Oh, my God.<eos> Sarah. Sarah.<eos> Are you in here?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Sarah?<eos> Sarah? Is that who you're looking for?<eos> You won't find her here.<eos> This is where the sheep come to die.<eos> - The sheep?<eos> - But before they go they must have the filth taken from them.
- A walk. Yes.<eos> Lovely.<eos> Why didn't you return to India?<eos> I was only ever Robert's wife in India.<eos> It seemed a bit absurd without a Robert.<eos> Now I find it most amusing to run a variety show, and I'll tell you why.<eos> Robert took me to music hall quite often - he was fond of them - On condition that I stayed behind the curtain in a box and was never visible.<eos> In those days, it was considered terribly improper for a married woman to be seen at a music hall.<eos> But times have moved on.<eos> And we must move with them, mustn't we?
The sandlot was like David's baseball kingdom.<eos> - Nine, eight-<eos> - But that summer, a kid named Singleton... who was the captain of a Little League team, set his sights on taking it from them.<eos> It was a bitter rivalry, and one day I got caught in the middle of it... - and almost didn't live to see tomorrow.<eos> - A hundred days of baseball.<eos> This is so much fun.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Hey, guys, who's that kid?<eos> What's that thing?<eos> He's one of them.
If they dare!<eos> The rooms and corridors have been equipped with hidden cameras... just to make sure there is no cheating.<eos> Everything is going according to plan.<eos> Anybody could scare these girls.<eos> It's a piece of fucking cake.<eos> My rules.<eos> My initiation.<eos> So, what brings you here?<eos> My parents went here, so...<eos> I think they want me to be just like them.

... dead people the recently departed...<eos> Unburied human corpses are returning to life... and feeding on the living.<eos> Stay inside.<eos> Do not try to leave your homes.<eos> They seem to survive by eating human flesh.<eos> Everyone who dies will become one of them.
A snake I did not expect...<eos> A little surprise, here.<eos> But are you sure?<eos> Among us it is not necessary to have a lot of discussions now we know well each other.<eos> I'm glad to see her quiet and smiling.<eos> Me too, however, I would need to be a bit quiet because my job is not so by definition, but with a moment of looking at her in the eye and I ask:<eos> - ...<eos> Where we're bringing Mario? - Look, doctor frankly I think there is nothing to be alarmed.<eos> I can understand the perplexity of your Collaborators they do their job.<eos> Only that one should avoid some of them did... - ... How to say, too well.
Hey, you guys.<eos> - Thank God you're here.<eos> - You have no idea.<eos> Good.<eos> Got you both.<eos> Now, how are my grandchildren coming along?<eos> Could you get me away from her, please?<eos> Just hinting, darling.<eos> One wants to have them while one's still young enough to pick them up.<eos> You know, what I do with your parents is remind myself... that if it wasn't for them, I wouldn't have you.
She was ninety-six so obviously I suspect foul play.<eos> I am spending my own money and I'm getting her body exhumed.<eos> And I am going to get a full rape exam performed.<eos> And I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.<eos> And my parents are not behind me.<eos> What else is new?<eos> They never are.<eos> They don't believe in me.<eos> So they're wrong this time.<eos> That sucks for them.
I'm so pleased to be invited here today.<eos> Too often...<eos> Too often, the great decisions are originated and given form in bodies made up wholly of men.<eos> So that whatever political value women have to offer is shunted aside without expression.<eos> This is a mistake.<eos> I think this might be the reason I'm... having such a difficult time giving voice to my own thoughts here today.<eos> I'm reminded of... what someone once said about looking at an elephant.<eos> It is impossible to ever see an entire elephant from one place.<eos> You have to walk around it.<eos> If our elected leaders are to be truly effective, they must learn to look beyond what is right in front of them to see the entire elephant.
So where do you put the stuff that you pull off the net, hm?<eos> Do you have a special little hiding place or something?<eos> I live alone.<eos> Why would I need a hiding place?<eos> Just what I've been wondering.<eos> I have looked through your whole house.<eos> Everything ... and I have found no porn.<eos> I have not found a single bit ... of porn.<eos> Guys tend to have porn around don't they?<eos> Nothing against it, nothing against them. It's just the way they're brought up.
Now you guys built this house yourselves?<eos> We did. We built...<eos> What you see, that's unusual.<eos> It is quite the unusual home.<eos> It's a monument to Brooklyn, my dear.<eos> He's my spouse.<eos> It's our anniversary of marriage on Sunday.<eos> I moved in three months before we closed.<eos> We had five wild dogs living in the building at the time.<eos> That's not one of them.
To walk with me<eos> I want to talk to God but I'm afraid 'Cause we ain't spoke in so long<eos> Jesus<eos> God, show me the way The devil's trying to break me down<eos> Walk with me<eos> The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now<eos> All along my pilgrim's journey<eos> I want Jesus to walk with me<eos> To the hustlers, killers murderers, drug dealers<eos> Even the strippers Jesus walks with them
You go in the crib, you listen to some music.<eos> That's the only thing that kind of cleared the nigga head.<eos> And the money never came between you?<eos> No, never that. Never that.<eos> 'Cause we all grew up together.<eos> At the end of the day, I ain't gotta make another record no more, but those will always be my niggas, 'cause I grew up with them.<eos> It was way bigger than hip-hop.<eos> Kind of like, that was our work.<eos> Those were my niggas right there.<eos> I grew up with them since we was like this, so nothing would ever come between us.
And if you ever want to see this coat again, Carlito better show up, alone.<eos> You okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I don't know what that whole thing was about, all right?<eos> Probably some old musicians' union beef or something.<eos> Come on, Carlito.<eos> What's your deal, huh?<eos> What do you do?<eos> I'm a booker. I book musicians.<eos> I tour with them.
Carlito. It's all right.<eos> You know, if you had a brain in your head... you would've took off and gone back to Puerto Rico already.<eos> Some hotshot off the street gonna come in here... think he doing me a favor and light this joint up.<eos> Everybody gotta split town.<eos> Buy the ticket.<eos> Catch that plane, and never come back.<eos> Otherwise your parents gonna be using that money for your funeral.<eos> I'm staying here, Carlito.<eos> No.<eos> You're going with them.
Persevere.<eos> Most times I'm a kind warrior out here.<eos> Most times, I am gentle, I am like a flower, I'm like... I'm like a fly on the wall, observing, noncommittal, noninvasive in any way.<eos> Occasionally I am challenged. And in that case, the kind warrior must, must, must become a samurai.<eos> Must become so, so formidable,<eos> so fearless of death, so strong that he will win, he will win.<eos> Even the bears will believe that you are more powerful. And in a sense you must be more powerful if you are to survive in this land with the bear.<eos> No one knew that.<eos> No one ever friggin' knew that there are times when my life is on the precipice of death and that these bears can bite, they can kill. And if I am weak, I go down.<eos> I love them with all my heart. I will protect them. I will die for them, but I will not die at their claws and paws.

I'll be one of them.
If it's in the den, I'm gonna fucking explode.<eos> Ghost, where's that hat?<eos> It's not okay for you to steal it.<eos> Oh, man!<eos> It's a friggin' den.<eos> One of the things I've heard about Mr. Treadwell, and you can see in a lot of his films, is that he tended to want to become a bear.<eos> Some people that I've spoken with would encounter him in the field, and he would act like a bear, he would "woof" at them. He would act in the same way a bear would when they were surprised.<eos> Why he did this is only known to him.<eos> No one really knows for sure.<eos> But when you spend a lot of time with bears, especially when you're in the field with them day after day, there's a siren song, there's a calling that makes you wanna come in and spend more time in the world.
Look at you.<eos> You're the best little fox.<eos> But how did I come into this work, Iris?<eos> Did you ever get the story?<eos> I was troubled. I was troubled. I drank a lot.<eos> Did you know that? You wouldn't even know what that is. But I used to drink to the point of that I guess I was either gonna die from it or break free of it.<eos> But nothing, nothing, Iris, could get me from... to stop drinking. Nothing!<eos> I went to programs. I tried quitting myself. I did everything that I could to try not to drink, and then I did everything I could to drink.<eos> And it was killing me until I discovered this land of bears and realized that they were in such great danger that they needed a caretaker, they needed someone to look after them.<eos> So I promised the bears that if I would look over them, would they please help me be a better person and they've become so inspirational, and living with the foxes too, that I did, I gave up the drinking.
In the summer of 2000 came an extended drought.<eos> The creek was so low that for weeks there was no salmon run, and starving bears simply ate their own.<eos> It has been only five, not even six days since the baby died. And this is all that's left of the little tyke. That's it!<eos> There's nothing else left. They've eaten everything.<eos> It's so sad. She was so cute.<eos> Five days and all that's left is a skull.<eos> This called for desperate measures.<eos> There are fish lining up about to try to make a run. And now they have a good reason for going because I have built them a corridor.<eos> Let's have a look at it.<eos> What I have done is... Have a look. I've constructed a runway for them, a navigational trail.
And I have remained safe.<eos> But every second of every day that I move through this jungle, or even at the tent, I am right on the precipice of great bodily harm or even death.<eos> And I am so thankful for every minute of every day that I found the bears and this place, the Grizzly Maze.<eos> But let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen. There is no, no, no other place in the world that is more dangerous, more exciting than the Grizzly Maze.<eos> Come here and camp here. Come here and try to do what I do.<eos> You will die.<eos> You will die here.<eos> You will frickin' die here.<eos> They will get you.<eos> I found a way. I found a way to survive with them.
Good. I think we can help.<eos> Jeff invented product placement.<eos> I feel I have to ask, uh...<eos> Are you concerned at all about the, um... about the health element?<eos> I'm not a doctor, I'm a facilitator.<eos> I bring creative people together.<eos> Whatever information there is, exists, it's out there.<eos> People will decide for themselves.<eos> They should.<eos> It's not my role to decide for them.
We'll talk at the station.<eos> Let him go.<eos> Stop or I'll shoot!<eos> You've got to see the secretary...<eos> Johnny, where are my elephants?<eos> Where are my elephants?<eos> - He's asking for his elephant. - Johnny!<eos> Give me back my elephants.<eos> Hey, we're both Thais. So, I'll warn you.<eos> Don't get involved with them.
It is March.<eos> Summer is over.<eos> And another long polar winter is about to begin.<eos> The birds have been feeding in the ocean waters for three months.<eos> Now, their bellies full it is time to find a mate.<eos> Their breeding ground can be up to 70 miles away.<eos> To get there they will walk day and night continuously.<eos> Sometimes for a week.<eos> It is a long, dangerous and seemingly impossible journey.<eos> And some of them will not survive it.
And if their partnership is successful, there will be new life.<eos> For now, they wait for the egg and for the brutal winter which will do everything in its power to destroy that egg.<eos> By May the light will nearly have disappeared from the sky and the temperature continues to drop.<eos> And for those who began their march too late or have fallen behind because of weakness or hunger hope of survival is now remote.<eos> The lone penguin has no chance against the winter's cold.<eos> He will simply fade away absorbed by the great whiteness all around him.<eos> As winter descends the tribe's only defense against the freezing cold is the group itself.<eos> It is almost as if they create another organism altogether.<eos> The huddled animals form a single moving mass one designed for the sole purpose of sustaining warmth.<eos> Winter's first storm is upon them.
And he will do this for more than two months.<eos> Having passed the egg the exhausted female must depart quickly.<eos> She must eat soon or she will die.<eos> As the winter progresses the father will be severely tested.<eos> The mother will be tested as well.<eos> Her return trip to the sea is considerably more difficult than the original march to the nesting ground.<eos> It is colder now. And she will have lost almost a third of her body weight producing the egg.<eos> She is literally starving.<eos> of course, the fathers are nearly starving too.<eos> But for them, a meal is far off in the distance.
They will also skim along the ice just below the ocean's surface searching for any fish that may have lodged there.<eos> While the mothers finally fill their empty bellies the fathers cling to life on the surface trying to keep the eggs safe and warm.<eos> The wind will occasionally bring snow to quench the males' thirst.<eos> They have been without food now for over three months.<eos> Each day brings them closer to exhaustion and starvation.<eos> Eventually some, usually the older ones will simply fall asleep and disappear.<eos> Now it is dark almost all the time.<eos> And the mother of all blizzards is about to arrive.<eos> The fathers now make an extra effort to weld their bodies together and resist the winter's rage.<eos> Above them, the southern lights dance virtually around the clock.
They will have lost as much as half their weight.<eos> But still they must walk for over 70 miles.<eos> This leg of the journey may be why they are fewer males than females.<eos> Each year some of these new fathers will not make it back to the sea.<eos> Like the sun, the chicks grow stronger every day.<eos> But they are not yet ready to leave their mothers.<eos> In time, after being perched atop their mother's feet for a thousand paces like a child learning to dance on her mother's shoes the chick takes his first steps alone.<eos> With the wind's return the temperature drops.<eos> This year, winter's going out with a bang.<eos> This is the first storm for the new chicks and many of them will not survive it.
-And then?<eos> -It was full of mist.<eos> I couldn't see a thing.<eos> Suddenly, I stop short.<eos> You can't guess what i found!<eos> That's what I'm asking you!<eos> -hedgehog mushrooms.<eos> -Chump!<eos> I don't care about your mushrooms!<eos> -Without them, I wouldn't see ...
Good evening, Aimé.<eos> The road is reserved for the army tonight.<eos> If you don't know where to stay, come.<eos> I must go.<eos> -The road is blocked.<eos> If you want, come.<eos> -What did you think? I was different?<eos> Under the skin, we are all alike.<eos> These poor guys over there ...<eos> -You think the Lord is with them?
-I am the judge Mierck.<eos> -I know who you are.<eos> -I want to talk to the prosecutor.<eos> -I'll tell him.<eos> -You wish to see me?<eos> -Mr. Prosecutor<eos> I wanted to talk about two or three things.<eos> The killers of the daughter Bourrache were arrested.<eos> They have confessed everything.<eos> One of them hanged himself probably torn by guilt.
Sorry about yesterday.<eos> Look, I haven't heard from you.<eos> Would you give me a call, please?<eos> Daniel.<eos> Oh, sorry, Sarge.<eos> I thought you were my son.<eos> Yeah. I'll be right there.<eos> What do you got?<eos> County asbestos cleaners were working on a deadline.<eos> One of them finds a body, calls it in.
I'll be sure to let your wife and kid know about everything you've done.<eos> Where are you right now?<eos> Why?<eos> You said you'd rather die, right?<eos> Unless I kill you.<eos> Where the hell are you, son of a bitch!<eos> Come on out asshole!<eos> I'm sick of low class bums being so proud of their so-called social titles.<eos> They take it for something important and think they can do anything.<eos> They even forget people like me are way above them and can't be beaten.
You can't be in love with me that much!<eos> You can't be in love with me that much!<eos> Zoraida, I swear I'll love you in spite of my mother.<eos> - But Carlos Alberto, your mom... - It 's open.<eos> I said I'd send you your bill by a messenger.<eos> Listen, Jacinto.<eos> - You and I agree on some things.<eos> - What things?<eos> We don't want our sons to get married.<eos> We know it will be a disaster for all of us especially for them.
By authority conferred upon me by the Spanish State... and in the name of His Majesty, the King... I declare you joined in matrimony.<eos> You may...<eos> Yes, you may.<eos> We closed the deal with the San Francisco hotel.<eos> I'll be going there, then.<eos> I can't stand you any more.<eos> - Is everything okay?<eos> - Yes, come and see.<eos> See what men are like? It makes no difference if they're gay.<eos> In the end, we always work for them.
Am I understood? - Understood, sir. - Understood, sir.<eos> Sergeant Dalton?<eos> Got you, Colonel.<eos> Nightingale? Find the blood sample.<eos> I want those things eradicated.<eos> And why don't you get cleaned up first.<eos> I am so ready to get some payback on these fuckers.<eos> What about you, Braxton?<eos> Long as my favourite uncle's checks don't bounce I go where Sam sends me.<eos> All I know is, why couldn't one of them be my ex-wife?
They're soldiers. They're trained for combat.<eos> Trained to fight other people.<eos> Not these things.<eos> We're trained to fight, period.<eos> And we have got you back.<eos> Just make sure you got ours and maybe we will all get to grow old one day.<eos> Or in your case, older.<eos> She digs me.<eos> Way to win friends and influence people, Ellis.<eos> I just don't think we need them.
- Hi, Reece, it's Steve.<eos> - Where are you? - I'm in Hadfield.<eos> Listen... - Hadfield?<eos> What are you doing there?<eos> We've got a benefit gig.<eos> Just listen, OK?<eos> The characters from Royston Vasey are alive.<eos> They've come alive and they want us to write a film for them...<eos> They stole the computer, yeah?<eos> It was them who stole the computer... I'm standing here with Hilary Briss. You bastard.
It is an honor and a privilege to speak to you today, to tell you about my condition, and the other world.<eos> ¶(Piano playing)<eos> The best singer/songwriter alive today, Daniel johnston.<eos> (Audience cheering)<eos> Man:<eos> ¶(Singing .Silly love)<eos> I noticed that from the start that Dan was different.<eos> I had him on a crib in our little bedroom and I would go in and talk to him, change his diaper, and I would squeal at him and he would squeal back at me.<eos> That's a small baby communicating, I thought.<eos> Being, uh, six years younger than his four brothers and sisters, he was pampered by them.
David: He lived in the basement of his parents' house.<eos> They got this perfectly normal ranch house out in the country behind new cumberland.<eos> He's got this amazing lab, like this amazing factory downstairs.<eos> He's turned a garage and two sort of utility rooms into a bedroom and an art factory, and he's just got everywhere, magazines, tapes.<eos> In fact, he's recreated it in waller, where he lives today.<eos> It's a duplicate of the same room.<eos> ¶ I was guilt stricken ¶<eos> Christian fundamentalist glass family.<eos> They're creative, they're intellectual, but there's this, like, West Virginia, kind of right-wing Christian thing. Daniel wasn't having' any of it.<eos> Spiritually he was separated from them, socially, every other way he was gone from them.
Mount Longdon is covered in smoke.<eos> The impacts are truly accurate.<eos> They take my friend away and I am left alone in my position, many people come to my position, they come to see the position, me.<eos> They gave me morphine and my legs didn't hurt, I didn't walk out... but I felt great.<eos> They used four of my partners to transport me.<eos> The four of them were really down, we were all really miserable.<eos> After the starvation, all this tragic end...<eos> My friends couldn't hold me, dude. And I weighted only 70 pounds.<eos> So that you get the picture, dude.<eos> It was very hard for them, I begged them to be careful.
It was so... It was a shock... seeing my legs...<eos> After many years seeing my legs...<eos> They gave me first aid there and then took me to a British ship. It was called Uganda.<eos> To resist pain, were you still on morphine?<eos> No then I changed to joints...<eos> At first it was morphine, then I suppose they were painkillers.<eos> I was totally wasted, they must have given me painkillers.<eos> Really human the guys, more than anything, human.<eos> My life depends a lot on them, although they tried to kill me.<eos> I'm alive because of them.
I hate little kids.<eos> You are a man of the cloth.<eos> How could you be a part of this?<eos> We're gonna let the hostages go.<eos> You wanna do what?<eos> Look, they're a handful.<eos> We got a couple of women, a child, an old man.<eos> They'll slow us down, maybe get us killed.<eos> No, no. No way.<eos> They're the only things that stand between us and them.
- Undercover. - Undercover.<eos> - Undercover!<eos> - Undercover!<eos> I didn't give a fuck about killing two gangsters.<eos> That was our mission.<eos> They were our quota.<eos> Those were our orders.<eos> I believed in what I did.<eos> I believed in protecting the people from the dirt on the streets.<eos> I believed there was a difference between us and them.
Then she said, "No wonder people kill cops."<eos> Nobody in here feels worse for her than Officer Wallace. Is that right?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> - That isn't why people kill cops, is it? - No, sir.<eos> Why do people kill cops, Wallace?<eos> Sir, because they see us as the enemy.<eos> - Because they distrust us.<eos> - No.<eos> It's because those people are not people at all.<eos> What's the difference between us and them, Wallace?
Dad!<eos> - Surprised?<eos> I can't believe this!<eos> Come on in, please.<eos> - l was on my way back from London... I thought I'd step off in Stockholm and spend a few hours with you lt's so nice to see you.<eos> - We won our case<eos> The grand court ruled in our favour<eos> These people... they come from demented stock<eos> These immigrants think they can just take over our inheritance... well, they can't<eos> And I shall take the greatest of pleasure in personally... driving them off our land
Why don't you answer the phone?<eos> I'm not talking any calls because you're here I want all my time to be with you.<eos> By the way, Gordon sent you this<eos> He shouldn't have.<eos> - He just bought another hotel<eos> Really?<eos> That's nice<eos> These people... they come from demented stock<eos> These immigrants think they can just take over our inheritance... well, they can't<eos> And I shall take the greatest of pleasure in personally... driving them off our land
I can't live without you<eos> We're going to work it out together with your parents.<eos> All right?<eos> Yes<eos> When will the flight land?<eos> - Any moment now<eos> It's already ten I tried, but they refused.<eos> I asked them if the mother could meet her son on the tarmac... they said, "lt's not possible."<eos> They said it could be possible for a Prime Minister or a President... not otherwise.<eos> - Tell them, my son is no less than them
It's so strange. I don't know what's come over me of late I've been giving wrong medication to my patients<eos> Somebody is going to die at my hands<eos> And you know what?<eos> You are responsible for that<eos> Me?<eos> - Yeah<eos> Because ever since I met you...<eos> I've never been so happy in life<eos> Tell you something... your eyes... I was really attracted to them<eos> But there's a strange kind of sadness in them
I've been dying to meet you, Jose Luis.<eos> You're a real institution within the force.<eos> That's true, but not everyone recognizes it.<eos> Can you believe they had me on patrol for years like a sap?<eos> But you're obviously leadership material.<eos> - And you know what you're doing.<eos> - You noticed that.<eos> - We got the people you wanted.<eos> - Terrific.<eos> It was hard, some of them weren't in the force anymore.
No.<eos> A sailor never kisses and tells.<eos> You're killing me.<eos> I did see something else that I wanted to talk to you about.<eos> I saw two POWs by themselves.<eos> It was like they were on vacation.<eos> They were. Sold out a long time ago.<eos> Maybe they were brainwashed.<eos> No more than us.<eos> You stay away from them.
Pass me a stone, will you?<eos> You still have a good aim<eos> Kajal, it's still the magic of your kiss<eos> Take off your sweater, you'll catch cold.<eos> "Rainy days usher in..."<eos> "days of reunion"<eos> "The pitter-patter of raindrops ignites fires of passion"<eos> "How we have begun to falter in our stride, we're indeed in a daze"<eos> "These days of rains..."<eos> "bring with them times of a reunion"

I'm so happy!<eos> Ria..<eos> ..I want to say something to you.<eos> Actually..<eos> Quietly tap your lips with mine and let that word go in.<eos> We've a whole life to talk and hear!<eos> Let's not wait!<eos> - Ria, I'm serious!<eos> Look into my eyes..<eos> ..I feel like enclosing you in them!
I'll feel very lonesome.<eos> is it true, Officer Kelly..<eos> ..that you went to Mr. Malhotra's office to warn him?<eos> I just went to caution him.<eos> - From whom?<eos> From Ria.<eos> During the investigation of Amit Singhania murder case..<eos> ..I came across the fact that Ria used to..<eos> ..make relationships with people just for her benefit..<eos> ..and the moment she had her way with them..

I was only 1 0 in 1 992<eos> My dad was a cop<eos> He and his 8 colleagues had a gun battle with a gang<eos> They took 45 shots in total<eos> What happened?<eos> 4 cops died<eos> My dad was one of them<eos> 1 3 years later Their sons and daughters became friends<eos> 3 of them became cops<eos> And I'm one of them

- I want these people kept at a distance.<eos> If they attempt to interfere, they're to be arrested.<eos> And if they resist, shoot them. - Sir?<eos> - Do it!<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> Not him.<eos> I'll need an interpreter.<eos> And interpret carefully, Chuma.<eos> Tell them I have waited long enough to find out who killed my men.<eos> This is a small town. One of them must know who is responsible.
You admitted some insane people.. ...and made them follow your military rules.<eos> And so you are showing off for that?<eos> You aren't a foolish man.<eos> You are a selfish man.<eos> Who let him in?<eos> You stupid military man.<eos> Keep your child in check first.<eos> I have seen two love birds today.. ...singing behind a tree.<eos> Do you know who they were?<eos> One of them was your daughter.. ...and the other one was that insane guy, Anand.
Well, is a trader's camel meant to compete?<eos> Don't worry. We'll handle it.<eos> Wait! Behold it from far.<eos> Let him see it to his heart's content.<eos> Anyway, we are going to claim it as a prize.<eos> The poor boy won't get a chance to see it for another year.<eos> Have a nice look at it, dear. - Hey... where is your uncle?<eos> Look there!<eos> Kanwarlal is right.<eos> We should let Banwari and Phutarmal... ride the camels instead of them.
Then there were more and more, and more, and they wanted to own everything.<eos> They deceived the good people, and little by little, they took away<eos> what they owned, until they got everything.<eos> They drove them out of their forests.<eos> The good people felt this was not fair so they turned to the Gods for help.<eos> But the Gods told them to fight on their own, that their destiny was to fight.<eos> The ambitious people had become powerful, so the good people decided to wait.<eos> And their land became dark, and desolate.<eos> And then?<eos> Then, the good people returned to fight for their land and their forest, because it belonged to them.
Shichibei.<eos> I'm so happy you've returned.<eos> Shichibei...<eos> You're looking worried.<eos> Is it, by chance, the men you returned with?<eos> Perhaps you are being thoughtful of my father and me.<eos> But are you sure... you want to forget the long days you spent with them?<eos> I have no choice.<eos> You were the one who told me about... looking up at the heavens, and being able to see the countless animals chasing each other across the sky.<eos> To them, looking down from the sky, all matters on the Earth seem so small.
We all learned on it.<eos> There it is.<eos> This is the old man right here.<eos> That thing is awesome.<eos> Look at the size of that puppy!<eos> Look at the dust on it.<eos> That's amazing.<eos> I mean, four older brothers, and the only sister.<eos> It's made her pretty rough and tough.<eos> Keeping up with them all those years, she was always determined to be right there with them.
Oh. my..!<eos> isogai. what do you think?<eos> Normally, I would reject it as an unfounded rumor.<eos> But, our lord said beware of Satomura.<eos> You mean the lord is also suspicious of him?<eos> That's correct.<eos> That's what we are here for.<eos> Isogai dono!<eos> Intruders have broken in!<eos> These men may be with them !
If you can tolerate my pizza, I can definitely tolerate cleaning up.<eos> My sister got married when she was eighteen.<eos> By the time she was my age, she had two kids.<eos> I saw her life.. housework, cooking, looking after the kids.<eos> Weren't you being forced to mary ?<eos> - Of course.. you've graduated now..<eos> all the nice boys will get married..<eos> it's our last responsibility.<eos> I got all of that.<eos> You fought with them and came here ?
- Of course.. you've graduated now..<eos> all the nice boys will get married..<eos> it's our last responsibility.<eos> I got all of that.<eos> You fought with them and came here ?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Four years ago.<eos> Dad was vey angy.<eos> I think Mom understands, but she doesn't have the courage to speak out<eos> Do you talk to them ?
And you'll gain her trust!<eos> How cliche!<eos> This is the 21st century, we need something modern!<eos> Don't we?<eos> Well, I think it's a great idea.<eos> Where did scientific methods go?<eos> Forget about science, I put more trust in my gut in certain cases.<eos> Make sure that you put some good men on this assignment.<eos> I want a real clean job.<eos> I'm happy to take care of them in an unscientific way.
How about a grouper around a catty<eos> Hey, you become sturdy<eos> What're you doing now?<eos> A transport worker.<eos> I worked in a construction site before<eos> Did my dad call you?<eos> He's OK<eos> But cops did come for investigation<eos> Don't worry. We didn't say anything<eos> We even pretended to ask them back...

Will they know what's in it?<eos> The Americans will have their intelligence, and they'll act on it.<eos> You'll see.<eos> We are not in the business of doing Russia's dirty work.<eos> It's not just the Russians, there are seven scientists from the private sector working at Kamshev four of whom are Americans.<eos> - How the hell did they get there?<eos> The Russians hired them to help decommission the plant.<eos> - Are they still alive?<eos> - We're not sure.<eos> One of them, Arthur Moffit has stayed in contact with Moscow by cell phone.
We're losing the signal.<eos> Must be on a real ride.<eos> Those are 70-mile-an-hour wind gusts.<eos> Is there a problem, major?<eos> I hope not.<eos> Ready to deploy chutes on my mark.<eos> Mark.<eos> Chutes open.<eos> Off the target.<eos> Well, there's nothing more we can do to help them now.
Sergeant Kelly.<eos> Bangkok police.<eos> - Shekhar here<eos> How's he doing?<eos> Not good<eos> I'm sorry for your loss.<eos> It must be hard on you<eos> I know you're still not very well, but formalities have to be completed<eos> Was any of these men there at the time?<eos> No, none of them.
I came to tell you that I'm willing to give you any help or assistance<eos> Unofficially, of course<eos> What reason for this favor?<eos> - Lots of reasons.<eos> I know how you feel<eos> If there's anyone who can pull this off, it's you<eos> I've seen your file in the office.<eos> I know what you're capable of doing<eos> The mafia here is very lucky.<eos> They always got away... because there wasn't strong enough evidence against them
No!<eos> But the journey was long and ...<eos> Kind of sick!<eos> Stop this car.<eos> It must change!<eos> He told me it would change!<eos> Farm, wanker!<eos> Rather fall on a serial killer!<eos> Not surprising that you like overripe fruit.<eos> You're as rotten as them.
Then there was Jack.<eos> If not for him, I'd be with you now, but he's still chasing his first love.<eos> With my letter burned, I have no passport to hollywood.<eos> But I don't care if you love me as I Iove you.<eos> That albert has a wonderful gift for curing vertigo. Yes.<eos> Hooray for Canadians!<eos> Grace is too busy looking for you to read what you write.<eos> She gave me the job of returning to sender.<eos> You again!<eos> The dead go on living for as long as you think about them.

After seeing a loved one killed, anyone would want to commit murder.<eos> But if you don't reveal this injustice...<eos> You are filled with words!<eos> I'm merely repeating the acts of your father.<eos> If you insist on trying to kill that man, I'll be forced to shoot you.<eos> Don't you know he must die for this to end?<eos> If you continue on like this, what about the villagers who turned away from KANG?<eos> Will you kill all of them too?<eos> Do you think they can live at peace with their bloodstained hands?<eos> KANG will have his way with them.
Let me go!<eos> Art!<eos> Don't!<eos> Enough!<eos> Leave that bastard alone!<eos> Let's go!<eos> I could use a few drinks.<eos> Look, Lae, we're in hell and Uncle Tao still wants his drink.<eos> What about the drink in those giant pots?<eos> I saw quite a few of them.
Get him.<eos> Get him.<eos> Street fight!<eos> Fights and fires go hand in hand with Edo men.<eos> Shut yourmouth, you asshole.<eos> Hey Yaji-san.<eos> Why are Edo men... so damn phony?<eos> Running at the mouth.<eos> Like verbal diarrhea.<eos> You think if I hang out with them, I'll turn phony too?
I'm not afraid of those bullies, But I know people make fun of you because I'm ugly,<eos> Nonsense! You're the prettiest thing on earth.<eos> Remember, find a chance and eat Tripitaka.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I can't do it,<eos> I've fallen in love with him.<eos> I never thought my husband would be a monk.<eos> I'm going.<eos> My Lord. we've lost Tripitaka,<eos> We have his disciples, surely he'll come back for them,
We still hear attacks.<eos> In nearby neighborhoods those who die are children, women, old people those who can't escape.<eos> The crisis worsens day after day.<eos> They attack homes, they arrest anyone on the street they shoot at cars and kill.<eos> What is their democracy and their human rights?<eos> Is it to detain citizens and put them in jail?<eos> Where are the human rights they were going to bring?<eos> We still do not know.<eos> There is not a single home in our neighborhood that has not been affected by the tragedy of this war.<eos> Sometimes you don't know if the planes are bombing the bases of the resistance or if the resistance is shooting at them.
Here, seventy thousand kisses.<eos> You the fair one, I the dark one.<eos> Then we are both brides! - What is this?<eos> And those poor things who left this morning?<eos> Are you forgetting their tears, their constancy?<eos> Can you be sure our original lovers won't die in the war?<eos> We'd both be left empty-handed.<eos> There's a wide gap between a sure thing and an uncertainty!<eos> What if they do come back?<eos> Then it's hard luck for them!
We have a strange file in our office.<eos> On the spine is written:<eos> "So-Called Tomie incidents."<eos> Tomie?<eos> A phantom beauty who appears all over Japan.<eos> A girl called Tomie sometimes just suddenly appears.<eos> When that happens in some area or community, a murder always occurs.<eos> The victim is always Tomie herself.<eos> It results from lust and jealousy.<eos> Various boys fight over Tomie, and then one of them kills her.
The inevitable!<eos> Whether it is on a hospital bed or on the terrace of a building facing the sea.<eos> The end result is the same.<eos> No!<eos> I can't leave you alone like this...<eos> Sim, I've betrayed a lot of people but I can't betray you to this extent.<eos> For few moments of happiness I can't ruin your entire life.<eos> This is the problem with lovers in Mumbai.<eos> Give them a little space, and the romance begins.<eos> They don't care what's going on around them.
But my daughter goes every year to Varadero.<eos> What did she have to escape there for?<eos> Do you see?<eos> It's that boy.<eos> Look, ma'am.<eos> I'm sorry for you but...<eos> I believe if both families collaborate, support each other, it's going to be easier to find the kids.<eos> Look, I'm sorry.<eos> But I've nothing to do with those people.<eos> I'd rather not get involved with them.
"Birds do it, bees do it" by Cole Porter, can not be compared with "I fucks like a beast" WASP.<eos> I tell you, are aberrant obscenities.<eos> Religious groups have launched a crusade against heavy metal feared that the Devil was a vehicle He created a satanic epidemic among adolescents.<eos> The letters have become a serious problem because glorify give glamor, and packaged evil.<eos> And then came the lawsuits.<eos> Artists metalheads were sued for inciting to suicide and homicide.<eos> The heavy metal was the moral panic of the moment.<eos> And fans of metal, were considered hopeless cases, the dregs of society.<eos> How do I know all this?<eos> Because I was one of them.
Skin!<eos> Innards!<eos> Head!<eos> Skin!<eos> Innards!<eos> Head!<eos> BROTHERS<eos> My village is a beautiful garden where flowers of every kind grow, but being separated from you causes me great pain.<eos> As my wayfaring friend breathed his last breath, he turned his face toward the village... so he could take leave of life more easily.<eos> Many travelers have come, but you were never among them.
What's going on here?<eos> Oh, this is just great!<eos> Don't you know that these peppers can rot overnight from the dew?<eos> Clear them up quickly and clean Ggeut-sun's room.<eos> Goodness me!<eos> Does a girl live here?<eos> Is that your daughter or hers?<eos> It's a big problem.<eos> Young folks always leave home for the mainland.<eos> Without them, it must be hard for the grandmothers.
Do you want me to read it?<eos> Just a small part for you.<eos> Just for you to see how crazy he is.<eos> Wanna see it?<eos> And I had sent him a very insolent letter.<eos> And he sent me another one, saying he was in love.<eos> Here.<eos> "I don't know...<eos> I'm very rich, I have a two-floor house... a car, a market, money in the bank.<eos> I have 16 employees, I pay 500 'reais' to each of them.
At first, you're scared and terrified of being tortured.<eos> You still don't know what they're going to do with you... so you are more scared of what may come... than of what you're already going through.<eos> Then... our body starts to scream because of your suffering.<eos> In my case, I basically got beaten up and shocked... on the Dragon's Chair.<eos> "The pepper" wasn't what I thought it was.<eos> It was something else, but it wasn't better.<eos> They called the shock machine "the pepper".<eos> Then, two guys came, yelling at me, and I was sitting on the stool... with the hood over my head.<eos> They hit me, beat me up... then they installed the machine... and made me connect the wires to my wrists and ankles.<eos> One of them, with an exposed wire... sent discharges on my neck, my ears, my back, you know?
You turned in, right?<eos> Answer me. Right? Yes, you did.<eos> You're cool.<eos> What's wrong? Come on.<eos> Who are those fucks?<eos> They're members of rival gangs.<eos> Who tipped you off?<eos> This kid from another gang is my informant.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> We can put them all away.
So he laughed once, and now you think you own the world.<eos> Tell him, thanks for the snack.<eos> You had the guts to lampoon the King.<eos> So why not the ministers?<eos> So we're allowed to satirize them too?<eos> Then help me set up an audition for more minstrels.<eos> Clothes define the man!<eos> Ladies!<eos> Get in line!<eos> Are we to make fun of the ministers or make them laugh?
That punk Yuki spilled meat sauce on my favorite jacket, man!<eos> He doesn't have the money to get me a new one either, I'm so bummed!<eos> I'll pay for it, so shut up.<eos> For real?<eos> You got the money?<eos> You're my idol, Mitsuru,<eos> All right. Gotta go.<eos> Your friends?<eos> Are you leaving?<eos> Are you leaving with them?
Yes, sir.<eos> Ngaw was shot dead outside Li Meng's casino.<eos> That's good.<eos> The police won't be focused on Guk's disappearance then.<eos> Guk's nothing.<eos> The police won't bother us unless we step on their toes.<eos> I'm more worried that Kamnan Buem and Li Meng will start a war.<eos> It'll be bad for us all.<eos> Those guys are completely paranoid.<eos> I'm not concerned about them.
Do we have a maximum perimeter?<eos> Edgar?<eos> We're looking at a radius of 60 miles centered at Acton.<eos> We're dispatching choppers and fixed-wing crafts to survey the area.<eos> No, that's going to take too long.<eos> Use the satellites. Conduct a thermal scan.<eos> It won't work.<eos> Why not?<eos> That area has a high concentration of electric power transmitters.<eos> The satellite won't be able to distinguish between them and the servers.
All right, everyone, let's go.<eos> Edgar...<eos> I'm busy, Chloe.<eos> I need you to release your system.<eos> Why? It's the only one with a random sequencer.<eos> You're gonna have to wait.<eos> I can't wait- someone called a lead in.<eos> And now that Marwan's escaped, I need to pursue this.<eos> This is more important. I have agents out there looking for Marwan.<eos> I need to reconfigure the perimeter for them.
We'll continue monitoring in real time.<eos> Alarm's a cambia model three.<eos> I'm jumping the relays at the door now.<eos> Roger that.<eos> All right, Jack, stop.<eos> We have somebody approaching from your west side.<eos> I repeat, your west side.<eos> Okay, he's moving away.<eos> Give me the status on the other four guards.<eos> Jack, you're right on top of them.
It's me.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Waiting for Nasim.<eos> I don't know why he's taking so long.<eos> Don't worry about that now.<eos> Things have changed.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Listen carefully, Behrooz.<eos> Government agents found me.<eos> I'm with them now.
You said that I would be okay.<eos> But what about you?<eos> We'll talk about that later.<eos> Right now, these men are coming to pick you up.<eos> I want you to go with them.<eos> Are they making you say this?<eos> No.<eos> I don't know who these people are.<eos> I want to be sure that they're not forcing you to say this.<eos> I'll come with them.
Thousands of people's lives are at stake.<eos> Where are the people who control the override?<eos> Talk to me, Sarah.<eos> I'm not a spy.<eos> Erin, Powell's dead.<eos> He was hit by a sniper as soon as we took him into custody.<eos> Did you find out anything from him before he was killed?<eos> No, but I managed to get the last ten calls he made off his cell phone.<eos> He called two numbers repeatedly.<eos> We traced one of them to Maryanne Taylor.
Work around you?<eos> We can do that.<eos> Mary o'connell.<eos> Taken 1972.<eos> Very promising empath.<eos> Robert fields, 1987.<eos> Genius with numbers and pattern recognition.<eos> John gersten... who are these people?<eos> Replacements, potentially.<eos> None of them make the slam dunk you would, but i'm ready to move this center forward, with you or otherwise.
Does it even matter?<eos> We could find a memo signed by the entire united nations security council.<eos> It's not going to cure anyone.<eos> Diana, we delivered confidential medical records to Dr. Burkhoff.<eos> We've got the so-called<eos> "father of 4400 technology" working on the case, and you just stuck a gun to the head of ntac's medical director.<eos> We've done everything we can to get the right people working on a cure.<eos> That's if ntac even wants a cure.<eos> Ryland's been talking about people in D. C. Who've been on a wartime footing for months.<eos> This is nothing but a stroke of luck for them.
previously on the 4400...<eos> We're not sure what's just happened.<eos> The light is gone. and thousands of people have just suddenly appeared.<eos> Some of them have been missing over 60 years.
They're consistent.<eos> Tess draws a picture of a...<eos> a tower, or a monument...<eos> Yeah, or a beacon... And the people around her drop everything and start building it.<eos> Well, they can't help themselves.<eos> It's like ants.<eos> Come here.<eos> The queen secretes a chemical, tells the other ants what to do.<eos> The drones don't stop working until the job is done.<eos> Doesn't matter if one of them dies, or if a storm comes and washes away the anthill.
The only way to find out is to let the patients finish building it.<eos> That night on Highland Beach, they were trying to tell us something.<eos> The conversation was cut short.<eos> Which is why we've been stumbling around in the dark this last year.<eos> Tess is the only 4400 who remembers where she was taken...<eos> No, claims to remember where she was taken.<eos> She's also the only paranoid schizophrenic.<eos> And it sounds to me like you two have been spending a little too much time around her.<eos> Well, maybe I caught the bug too, but, uh...<eos> I agree with them.
I don't know who it is, but someone knows we're 4400s.<eos> Start packing.<eos> How'd it go today, daddy?<eos> That bad, huh?<eos> Nobody wants to buy time shares in Wilmington, Idaho.<eos> Baja, California maybe.<eos> If I were you, I'd go in there and tell them "either let me have the good listings, or I quit".<eos> The whole staff wants Baja, honey and I don't have the seniority.<eos> How is that fair?<eos> You've been a salesman longer than any of them.
I love... arms.<eos> Hey, what -- what is this?<eos> It's your lucky day.<eos> You get to live.<eos> We're gonna need that ring.<eos> And the finger it's on.<eos> What's happening?<eos> !<eos> There are people out there who want you dead.<eos> Fortunately for you, we're not them.
I get it.<eos> Not okay.<eos> I don't know how I'm gonna do this.<eos> Well, you know, it's not too late.<eos> We can always have Weiss dress up as Irina.<eos> I'm sure he'd make a great housewife.<eos> I don't remember my parents back when they were together.<eos> Well, you were a little girl.<eos> I remember the time.<eos> I don't remember them.
It should start taking effect.<eos> It's working.<eos> Relax.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Schmuck, Alex?<eos> He was under the impression this was a negotiation.<eos> He was mistaken.<eos> Now I don't particularly care who you are and who you work with, but I'm sure your conspirators will have their hands full with the hard drive we sent you.<eos> Oh.<eos> All this is for them.
Well, it's clearwhat must be done.<eos> - We have to burn the school to the ground.<eos> - Stan!<eos> Fine, fine. We'll talk to the principal.<eos> Soon, my pet.<eos> Soon I will feed you the world.<eos> - Stan!<eos> - Coming.<eos> These academics are expert at using mind games... to implant their liberal agendas.<eos> I've dealt with them before, so leave the talking to me.
Like i need a knife in the head. Come on, we've got to get those crystals.<eos> Trance.<eos> Come out of there.<eos> But i will destroy the ship.<eos> But our sister has come home.<eos> You have waited. So has she.<eos> So long.<eos> Come.<eos> I could help you find the crystals.<eos> I'm attuned to them, hypersensitive.
Look at this delicious piece of irony.<eos> I'm being sued for divorce.<eos> Me.<eos> Thought you were single?<eos> Yeah, I keep forgetting that I got married.<eos> Gob met a woman one night, and after a series of escalating dares married her.<eos> Yes, but it's all coming back to me now.<eos> She was a seal dealer.<eos> She raised and sold seals to aquariums and marine parks, that sort of thing.<eos> Then she went off to fight her war and left me to look after them.
You don't understand.<eos> You're making weapons for the Fire Nation!<eos> You make weapons for the Fire Nation!<eos> Explain all this!<eos> Now!<eos> It was about a year after we moved here.<eos> Fire Nation soldiers found our settlement.<eos> You were too young to remember this tale.<eos> They were going to destroy everything, burn it to the ground.<eos> I pleaded with them, I begged them to spare us.
We're finally here...<eos> I can't believe how many waterbenders live up here!<eos> We'll find a master to teach us, no problem!<eos> This place is beautiful.<eos> Yeh, she is.<eos> Winter, spring, summer and fall.<eos> Winter, spring, summer and fall.<eos> Four seasons, four loves.<eos> Four seasons, four loves.<eos> Tonight, we celebrate the arrival of our brother and sister from the Southern Tribe... and they have brought with them someone very special... someone whom many of us believed disappeared from the world until now.
Make their tactics work for us.<eos> Here's what I would do.<eos> At position code Deacon, we'll need three civilian freighter ships to use as decoys.<eos> Which means those passengers will have to be relocated to other ships which are already overcrowded.<eos> Yes, if you approve.<eos> The decoy ships will jump into the enemy star system at extreme radar range from the Cylon asteroid.<eos> Galactica will jump here, close enough to launch its Vipers at the base.<eos> Soon as the decoy freighters arrive in the system, they'll break wireless silence.<eos> They'll be posing as a mining fleet coming after the tylium and pretend to be unaware of the Cylon presence.<eos> The Cylons will hear the messages and send a force of Raiders after them.
I apologize.<eos> Here. I'm going to make it up to you, I promise. okay?<eos> Ice cream later.<eos> -Take care.<eos> - I'll talk to you later.<eos> Talk to you later.<eos> Can we just stick to the business here?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm gonna need a list of your employees, all right?<eos> We'll find out-- run them through the system, see if any one of them have a drug conviction.
We can appeal this.<eos> I'll get right on it.<eos> I've taken the liberty of reviewing some of your other work, Sally.<eos> You're a very good lawyer, but not good enough.<eos> We're letting you go.<eos> - You're firing me?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I have done a lot of good work here.<eos> Yes, you have. And any number of law firms would be happy to have you.<eos> This one, unfortunately, just doesn't happen to be one of them.
Denny's in charge, which is fine as long as he doesn't speak.<eos> - I need you to take over.<eos> - How do I just take over?<eos> He'll completely...<eos> You handle him, Lori, the way only you can.<eos> - Uh-huh. What's the case?<eos> - It's a variation of the Scopes trial.<eos> Three teachers were fired for refusing to teach creationism.<eos> - They've sued.<eos> - Sounds like a slam dunk for them.
You bitch !<eos> She puts my baby inside her, hey, quickie retirement plan.<eos> You know, I can't think of a better reason for a man to kill a woman.<eos> If I'd have killed her, you think I'd put her in my own motorcoach, and then present it at an unveiling ceremony that I was announcing ?<eos> You don't believe me, go ask the convention authorities.<eos> I told them what she was trying to do.<eos> It's the last time I ever hire those skanks to work a show.<eos> Ye... Yes, yes, I'm very aware of Butterfield Academy's privacy policy, but this a homicide...<eos> Daluca's all over the condoms.<eos> Get this, on one of them, his DNA and her epithelials are on both sides.
Body dump.<eos> Chester, you been taking that thing off road again ?<eos> Nah, mud screws up the ride.<eos> I bet you always get a bad cart at the store ?<eos> Not me.<eos> Thanks, guy.<eos> Sir, all I'm asking for is your class roster.<eos> Yes, yes, I'm very aware of Butterfield Academy's privacy policy, but this a homicide investigation.<eos> Daluca's all over the condoms.<eos> And get this, on one of them...
ere Mark knew the pot was th because of Jeremy.<eos> Come on, I'm sure Jeremy wasn't voted the most popular boy in school.<eos> He's done everyone's term paper. He's a nerd.<eos> So you guys want to come over and hang out?<eos> I could sell you some pot.<eos> Now, where are you gonna score fresh herb<eos> My parents are going out of town.<eos> My dad has pounds of it.<eos> Yeah, so how does that end up a quadruple murder?<eos> One of them was stupid enough to bring a gun.
CSI: episode 5x15 King Baby<eos> Mr. Eiger had a lot of enemies.<eos> Any idea who might have done this?<eos> I'm not ready to confirm the circumstances under which Mr. Eiger died.<eos> I will say that this is the number one priority for the mayor and for all of us in law enforcement.<eos> So, he either jumped, fell or was pushed.<eos> Well, the facial impact is consistent with the blood pool... but not with the current position.<eos> Well, he landed on his face, but it looks like his head got moved.<eos> And not by the paramedics.<eos> And according to them, he had a broken neck.
CSI: episode 5x12 Snakes<eos> Female, early 30s, Hispanic descent, vitreous potassium was 11.74 milli-equivalents per liter, so PMI*'s approximately six hours.<eos> So time of death roughly 1:00 a.m.<eos> C.O.D. ?<eos> From what I got here, I can't tell you much.<eos> Minimal dilation in the pupils indicates decapitation was post-mortem.<eos> Scalp shows naked follicles without hairs, no inflammation around them indicates removal was post-mortem as well.
You don't shoot a man with the door open.<eos> Keep your eye on this.<eos> You got it ?<eos> The shooter had to open the door when he took off.<eos> Okay, stop.<eos> - Nine-millimetre.<eos> - Photograph it.<eos> What is this ?<eos> It's... it's an old case from San Diego.<eos> "They were found the next dawn, in a dry river bed, their intestines exposed, and many cats feasting upon them."
Shooting in Miami Shores.<eos> You might recognize the address.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.<eos> You might want to rethink that deal.<eos> Jojo posted bail two hours ago, and he's being gunned down already?<eos> You know, it's not for lack of motive, is it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He was very good at making enemies.<eos> Yes.<eos> The question becomes which one of them got to him first?
I'd appreciate that.<eos> Call me.<eos> Will do.<eos> Gerber ?<eos> I'm sorry, I don't.<eos> Last week ?<eos> Yeah, it was an appendectomy.<eos> That's probably why.<eos> It was sandwiched between two coronary artery bypasses.<eos> One of them had complications.
What happens if there are applications?<eos> Well, the technology is licensed by the university, so any commercial applications would generate fees for the school.<eos> And for you?<eos> Of course.<eos> Anyone else?<eos> The university is not noted for its munificence when it comes to licensing revenue.<eos> What about your research assistants?<eos> Indispensable.<eos> And undercompensated?<eos> For them, knowledge is its own reward.
Is there something else?<eos> I'm coming.<eos> Ruthie, it's Lila. Open up.<eos> What you got on you?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Lipstick. I was cleaning.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I just brought you over some of my biscuits.<eos> - I don't like biscuits. - You sure?<eos> Professor was always very partial to them.
I remember everything because I was unaffected by the spell.<eos> You remember everything because you broke it.<eos> Time rewound,<eos> - but we still experienced it.<eos> - Headache forming.<eos> All that matters is that we fixed it, regardless of the consequences.<eos> Consequences?<eos> You mean Kyle?<eos> No, I mean the Elders.<eos> I went against them and sided with the Avatars.
She's less intuitive, more predictable.<eos> But she's also a Whitelighter now.<eos> Which puts her in constant contact with the Elders.<eos> Besides, Phoebe's a celebrity.<eos> Idolised.<eos> Envied.<eos> The way I deserve to be.<eos> And someday will be.<eos> Lawyers!<eos> There should be a special place in hell for each and every one of them!
- that I was attacked at P3 today.<eos> - Oh, my God. Are you okay?<eos> I'm alive.<eos> The demons won't be when I'm done with them. Providing I can find them.<eos> - They're not in the Book?<eos> - Too many fit the description.<eos> God, that is so weird.<eos> Demons never attack at P3.<eos> Even weirder, I don't think they wanted to kill me.<eos> One of them could have nailed me with a fireball, but then didn't.
Hey, I think I figured out how to...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm organizing the candy for tomorrow.<eos> I have chocolate, sugar-free, and chocolate with nuts.<eos> Isn't part of the fun of Halloween the mixed-bowl thing?<eos> No, I don't want any allergic reactions or angry parents.<eos> We've got enough problems as it is.<eos> Speaking of those problems, I think I have figured out how to get the press off of our broomsticks.<eos> Holy...! We have rats.<eos> Yeah, they're everywhere, get used to them.
We blow up the Command Carrier.<eos> Blow up... the Command Carrier?<eos> The entire Command Carrier?<eos> All of Scorpy's data is on this ship.<eos> He's retro'd the entire damned hull into a repeated necessary to stabilize a wormhole.<eos> This boat is the Peacekeeper wormhole project.<eos> But, this carrier's huge.<eos> Over a metra long.<eos> Is it possible to blow up the whole ship?<eos> It's armed to the teeth. We can blow the munitions store. Hell, we can stick a banana in the tailpipe.
- Oh, Christ, don't let me die.<eos> I don't wanna die.<eos> I don't want to die lying in my own shit.<eos> Oh, man, oh, man,<eos> I'm getting hard just looking at that beauty.<eos> Rack 'em, Prag.<eos> So, I hear Pancamo caught the flu or something.<eos> - It may be fatal.<eos> - Good.<eos> If it isn't, when he gets out, we'll make it fatal.
I'm fine, sir. I was just... .<eos> - Someone gave me this chess set.<eos> - Yeah, it's from me.<eos> - You're kidding? - No.<eos> The prime minister gave me a few sets, and I wanted to give them as gifts.<eos> - I'm really overwhelmed.<eos> - The State of the Union was really something else.<eos> - Thank you again, sir.<eos> This one's a lotus set in hand-carved camel bone.<eos> She told me it came from a descendent of Tansen.
Before we go any further there's one thing.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - lt's called a butcher's shop.<eos> Yeah, "Dodds and Son." He ain't still going on about that, is he?<eos> His old man put that sign up.<eos> I'd want to keep my camper here.<eos> I still need my own space for the camper.<eos> 'Course you can.<eos> No charge.<eos> I'll even give it a regular once-over for you.
Where's the other people?<eos> Where's the audience?<eos> Where's the magic?<eos> I'll tell you.<eos> In a place like this, the magic is all around you.<eos> The trick is to see it.<eos> Luke... ... IthinkyoulovedTheMajestic even more than I did.<eos> -You've got to remember that.<eos> -I don't.<eos> It sounds crazy, but I promise we can make this place like it was!
You're all pale.<eos> - It's my complexion.<eos> - Oh?<eos> Shit!<eos> What's that?<eos> Oh!<eos> His mobile!<eos> What's it doing here?<eos> My husband's mobile.<eos> He thought it'd been stolen.
And basically, a half-pipe was what a swimming pool was, but we just hadn't figured out how to build a half-pipe back then yet, so we had to empty swimming pools and ride them.<eos> There wouldn't be any X Games, there wouldn't be any vert skating, there wouldn't be anything at all if it wasn't for most of the boys that I skated with and competed against, and that whole scene.<eos> That's where it all started.<eos> Craig Stecyk saw what we were doing before anybody else did, and he believed in it as a culture, and he presented it as a culture.<eos> People thought this was some, like, stupid thing that little kids did. Right?<eos> Craig Stecyk understood it as more of an extension of society.<eos> I think it was an act of significance.<eos> I think you guys were doing some profoundly different things. And I think nobody appreciated that at the time I got involved with dealing with it.<eos> Skateboarding could have easily, without Craig Stecyk, become little league baseball. It would have just been a novelty.<eos> But, you know, the way Craig presented it, and the way he wrote about it, I mean, it really brought it to another level, and it gave it a significance.
Tok wanted to be legend.<eos> And as for O, he just wished no one would've known his existence<eos> I guess death was the way out.<eos> To seek for virtue and get virtue.<eos> That's right.<eos> They both got what they wanted in this ending.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Suddenly, I realized how ridiculous I was being.<eos> The book needs an ending.<eos> When it's sold and turned into a movie, what it needs is just an ending.
- Then do it.<eos> Wait. OK, wait.<eos> Dawn, everybody, hold on.<eos> Why are you smiling?<eos> That's inappropriate.<eos> - Because it's temporary.<eos> - What is?<eos> The demon.<eos> It's gonna dissipate.<eos> The only way for it to survive on this plane is if it were to kill the subject of the original spell.
Jackson, it's Sookie.<eos> I was wondering if you could call me back when you get a chance.<eos> Sooner rather than later.<eos> It's not an emergency, so don't freak out or anything.<eos> The carrots still look good.<eos> Seems like it's a shame to eat them... sort of like you should put them in a vase...<eos> - Hang up.<eos> - Call me.<eos> I got his voice mail.<eos> Good. It gives you time to prepare what you'll say... maybe have suggestions ready of places to go.
No!<eos> Khakis!<eos> Morning, Grace.<eos> Morning.<eos> Whatcha doing?<eos> Just getting some coffee.<eos> Karen, tell Bodyguard he can go.<eos> I no longer plan to kick your ass.<eos> Down, number five!<eos> Listen, uh, why don't you head home and stand guard over the prime rib. This morning I saw Rosario giving it the glad eye.
Why? Kenny is my friend.<eos> Why can't God take someone else's friend?<eos> Stan, sometimes God takes those closest to us, because it makes him feel better about himself.<eos> He is a very vengeful God, Stan. He's all pissed off about something we did thousands of years ago.<eos> He just can't get over it, so he doesn't care who he takes.<eos> Children, puppies, it don't matter to him, so long as it makes us sad.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> But then, why does God give us anything to start with?<eos> Well, look at it this way.<eos> If you want to make a baby cry, first you give it a lollipop, then you take it away.

Duty Officer Lane to the paint shop.<eos> Duty officer to the paint shop.<eos> You all right, Mr. Tyler?<eos> Tiptop, Eddie.<eos> Tiptop.<eos> Wanna thank you for that liberty pass.<eos> My girl thanks you, too.<eos> You're a good man, Mr. Tyler.<eos> Heart's in the right place.<eos> Just need to give it some time.
Great! - Just when I got a lot on my mind.<eos> - Your mind don't hold a lot.<eos> Get dressed.<eos> And don't forget, it's tuxedo.<eos> - I'm hungry. I don't wanna get dressed now.<eos> - You want a snail?<eos> You nuts?<eos> I'm gonna have a snail? Come on!<eos> You eat steamers.<eos> A snail leaves a trail of scum in the yard when it walks.
- My tank.<eos> - Your tank?<eos> My sensory deprivation chamber.<eos> I spend a lot of time in there.<eos> Not something my colleagues are too keen about.<eos> What's this?<eos> The brain of a rat.<eos> Right now, it thinks it's pressing a lever for some food.<eos> That's why the light flash.<eos> Every time it flashes, the authorities send an electrical impulse to make it think it's been rewarded.
Have you lost your mind?<eos> I just got you're message.<eos> I've got blueprints for the base.<eos> All I have to do now is to get inside.<eos> Again, and then what.<eos> My research shows the parasite has a primitive social instinct.<eos> A hive mentality<eos> - Ants or bees or something like it. - Find the hive.<eos> We've got our evidence.<eos> The parasite generates a weak electromagnetic impulse to help it locate others like it.
Hey, neal, can i put my history book in your locker Until after next period?<eos> I don't have a lot of extra room.<eos> Ok, now you're inging the dummy to school with you?<eos> Hey, it's called a figure, not a dummy.<eos> A dummy is someone who calls it one.<eos> Oh, is it?<eos> No, don't take it out.<eos> Relax. it's just morty, bill.<eos> Yeah, you got a problem?<eos> Tell it not to talk to me.
Stupid pothole. Don't worry, head.<eos> The computer will do our thinking now.<eos> Oh, yeah. Perfect.<eos> Now, then - Computer, kill Flanders.<eos> Did I hear my name?<eos> My ears are burning.<eos> Good start. Now finish the job.<eos> Oh, you're busy.<eos> Catch you later, "computator."<eos> Oh, $5,000 for a computer, and it can't handle a simple assignment.
Just-- just one thing. okay?<eos> You can't go through with this.<eos> - Not with you standing here.<eos> - You can't give your sperm to Claire.<eos> Because...<eos> because that sperm is mine.<eos> Sorry. but I'm pretty sure the doggone sperm is mine.<eos> Yeah. but I took that sperm to movies.<eos> I schlepped it through Europe.<eos> I bought it a little gel seat for your bike.
No, no.<eos> This is... That's totally unfair!<eos> Hyde, you suck.<eos> You could have been a man and forgiven her. But no. You wanted to do the math.<eos> Man, math has never been my friend.<eos> Wait. No. But she had other guys in my van.<eos> Michael, you had other girls in your van while we were dating.<eos> So, give me my $8,000.<eos> Okay. I change my mind. I forgive you.<eos> See, if we had a baby right now... we could be giving it a bath.
Have you lived here your whole life? Not yet.<eos> This place... ... usedtobe alldirtroads and marsh grass.<eos> Really?<eos> My mom hated it here. She took me away to Virginia when I was ten.<eos> But I came back when I was 1 6... ... andneverleft. I missed it.<eos> ... missedmydad.<eos> The quiet.<eos> The wind.<eos> The wind? You call that wind?<eos> The wind... ... inChicagoin thewintertime... ... youwalkwithyourback toit or it cuts your face.
We are all here as you requested, but so far we have seen nothing.<eos> -General--<eos> -Certainly, on behalf of the Russian Consortium which has lost many of our citizens in recent conflicts...<eos> -...it is our hope that this exercise--<eos> -This is no exercise.<eos> Good God.<eos> General, listen to me. The fleet is not our main concern.<eos> Leave them to the defense grid.<eos> The death cloud itself is the real danger.<eos> They will try to knock your fleet aside to position their planetkiller where it can strike.
Pen!<eos> I'm sure they had to do it more than once. For him to look half-dead like that.<eos> I guess so.<eos> Now I know why he got tired so easily lately.<eos> Not like before.<eos> We used to do it all the time.<eos> Morning, noon, and night.<eos> Sometimes, we even set the alarm clock for this!<eos> Wow! What a lucky girl you are.<eos> In my opinion... - he deserved to get it chopped off. - Chopped what off?
These streamlined forms are made by means of this machine.<eos> For a plate worker, this is one of the most complicated machines to operate.<eos> Not only do you have to know its power and be able to work with it, you also have to be able to calculate the effect on the plate when it is pressed under this powerful machine.<eos> To train somebody to work this machine properly can easily take one or two years.<eos> Working the stringer oven, that was very tough.<eos> You put a stringer in an oven that was ten meters long.<eos> When it came out, it was red-hot.<eos> At first, I thought I would not be able to bear it.<eos> Visitors to the shipyard, interested in our work, recoiled from the heat.<eos> And we had to bend over the stringer to give it the right shape.
- The Gentlemen.<eos> - Don't know.<eos> - You certain?<eos> - No. We're out of Weetabix.<eos> We are out of Weetabix because you ate it all.<eos> - Again.<eos> - Get some more.<eos> I thought vampires were supposed to eat blood.<eos> Yeah, well, sometimes I like to crumble up the Weetabix in the blood.<eos> Gives it a little texture.
What are you doing?<eos> I'm going.<eos> Now?<eos> - That's your solution?<eos> - That's my decision.<eos> - Don't I get any say in this?<eos> - No.<eos> Veruca was right about something.<eos> The wolf is inside me all the time.<eos> And I don't know where that line is any more, between me and it.
- And blamed his daughter?<eos> That's the lowest thing I've ever heard.<eos> Peter, take that thing off and come home. Hey, Lois.<eos> You're just in time for the exciting conclusion.<eos> Looks like some boob's about to get lynched. Let's watch.<eos> That's the guy who ruined our cable.<eos> What is wrong with you people?<eos> Okay, yes. My husband is responsible for knocking out TV. But we should be thanking him.<eos> He's broken television's hypnotic spell over us.<eos> Now we can see the world for what it is a beautiful place full of wonderful things just waiting to be experienced.
He grabbed me. He tried to strangle me !<eos> - He's been brain neutered, you moron !<eos> - Crichton !<eos> This bastard just tried to frag us.<eos> Did not.<eos> Yeah he did, and I'm ready to kick his sorry ass off the ship right now !<eos> Listen to me !<eos> He isn't cured !<eos> I saw it in his face.<eos> The evil, it was there !
I can't take Moya's pregnancy much longer.<eos> The walls of my cell are excreting some sort of gel... and Pilot says it is due to Moya's condition.<eos> The center chamber has taken on some kind of strange odor as well. Have you noticed?<eos> I have a Luxan's olfactory sense. How can I not notice?<eos> Where the hezmana are Crichton and Aeryn? They should be back by now.<eos> - Teaching Crichton takes time, D'Argo.<eos> - Teaching Crichton is a waste of time.<eos> Am I the only one here who remembers we are being tracked by bounty hunters?<eos> Aeryn believes that anything we can do to make Crichton more effective, the better.<eos> This sector is very peaceful. It's perfect for Crichton's trai...
Let's fly.<eos> Hey, Skates, just think about dinner.<eos> It gets me back to the boat every time.<eos> Damn it, the ladder is greasy.<eos> Sorry, ma'am, I should have wiped it down.<eos> Skates, you got a track file on that airliner yet?<eos> Hey, Skates, are you with us?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> This new software's just dropping a load on me.<eos> So give it a kick.
Oh, just a few items I thought might have some historical value.<eos> Looks like a good haul.<eos> If that's it...<eos> Oh, uh, yes, there is one other item:<eos> uh, a small vessel that could be an asset.<eos> We've already got a full complement of shuttles, not to mention the Delta Flyer.<eos> What do we need with this derelict ship?<eos> Chakotay, this ship is a diamond in the rough.<eos> Sure, it's got some scrapes and scratches, but, here, take a look at these systems.<eos> It has a neurogenic interface that allows it to react directly to the pilot's thoughts.
I need... I need a seed.<eos> Here, here.<eos> Pretend... Pretend that that's a seed.<eos> - It's a rock. - I know it's a rock.<eos> I know.<eos> But let's just pretend for a minute that it's a seed, all right?<eos> We'll just use our imaginations.<eos> Now, do you see our tree?<eos> Everything that made that giant tree is already contained inside this tiny little seed.<eos> All it needs is some time, a little bit of sunshine and rain, and voilà!
Yes, sir.<eos> Yes, it's very important that I speak with Herman Cromwell.<eos> No, he's a patient there.<eos> Well, can I get a message to him that Dr. Orinsky called from the lab at Oldham Space Center up in Maryland?<eos> Yes, it's very important that I speak to him.<eos> I'm an old colleague ofhis.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> The substance found in Dr. Orinsky's wounds is combinant alien-human DNA.<eos> This DNA is structurally similar to Eve's... but it's not a perfect match.
you got to change your associations.<eos> hell is for cowards, for hypocrites, for people who fear to live by the strength of their own conviction.<eos> now, this is war!<eos> given the circumstances and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we've all chosen life over death.<eos> I mean, two wrongs don't make a right, so our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less.<eos> I don't know, boyd.<eos> just seems to me ever since you started this personal growth, self-help, power fucking dysfunctional fucking bullshit, you are all fucked up in the head! don't even go there.<eos> you don't know what the hell you're talking about, all right?<eos> personal strength has nothing to do with this.<eos> true, it's helped me to unlock energies and see my options more clearly, but to give it credit for all of this is a little bit more than they deserve.
A little more, please.<eos> A little more, please.<eos> There should still be more.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> This is it?<eos> Sawada and God<eos> I keep having this dream... They sit me in this chair. In front if me is God, talking.<eos> God?<eos> I think that's what it was.
Would you just tell them?<eos> Oh, now you don't understand English?<eos> She was not trying not to laugh. You know what?<eos> - I can do it.<eos> - He says he can do it.<eos> All right, Linus, go get her.<eos> Give him the accelerator. - Natural?<eos> Chemical?<eos> - I don't need an accelerator.<eos> - Make it powerful. - Thanks a lot.
Did Mr Whitmore notice I was tardy?<eos> - The word you're searching for is "absent".<eos> - Tardy people show.<eos> - And yes, he did notice... ..so he wanted me to give you this.<eos> As far as punishments go, this is fairly abstract. - No!<eos> It's your baby.<eos> - OK, I get it even less.<eos> It's the "sex leads to responsibility" thing, which I don't get.<eos> You gotta take care of the egg.<eos> It's a baby. Teach it Christian values.

Me too.<eos> I had the best day ever!<eos> Dude, check this out!<eos> Tell my friend you like my hat.<eos> -What's your friend's name?<eos> -Chandler.<eos> Hi, Chandler.<eos> -That's--<eos> -That's Fergie, baby!<eos> Joey says you don't like his hat, but I think it's kind of dashing.
I think these women should just forget about marriage... and have a good time.<eos> I have a friend who'd always gone out with extremely sexy guys... and just had a good time.<eos> One day she woke up, and she was 41.<eos> She couldn't get any more dates.<eos> She had a complete physical breakdown... couldn't hold her job and moved back to Wisconsin to live with her mother.<eos> Trust me... this is not a story that makes men feel bad.<eos> Most men are threatened by successful women.<eos> If you want to get these guys, you have to keep your mouth shut... and play by the rules.<eos> I totally believe that love conquers all.<eos> Sometimes you just have to give it a little space... and that's exactly what's missing in Manhattan... the space for romance.
- so the system took countermeasures.<eos> - Why didn't it just zap him too?<eos> Its creator?<eos> It needed to impress him.<eos> A particle beam would've been overkill.<eos> - Unlike a dozen crack dealers.<eos> - No, you see, that's its sense of humor.<eos> But if you load the Kill Switch, what's to stop it from playing a funny joke on us?<eos> Well, obviously we can't inject Kill Switch over the Net. There's only one way now.<eos> We must find it and physically feed it the poisoned apple.
Fish aren't like other organics.<eos> They're more passive, I think, most of them.<eos> And so clean.<eos> Um, is there anything I can do to help with repairs?<eos> Well, as soon as I'm done with lunch, you could help me access your primary matrix.<eos> Gladly.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> Seeing the ship ripped apart like this, it's...<eos> I guess I can't help feeling a kind of affinity for this vessel.<eos> It sustains my existence and sometimes I feel like it's a part of my body... my soul.
As a shield.<eos> An example for those willing to die in the name of Islam.<eos> Victory or death... both lead to Paradise.<eos> - I'm not a warrior.<eos> - Come now!<eos> Your eloquence alone gets the masses marching!<eos> Have you nothing to say, Sheik Riad?<eos> Who'll run the country?<eos> No one.<eos> It will run itself.
Man, I'm winded.<eos> - Michael Moore.<eos> - Michael. Good to meet ya. Governor Thompson here?<eos> No, he's actually...<eos> he's out of state.<eos> He's out of state? We brought some people here who are recipients of welfare.<eos> They would like to come in and clean the governor's office.<eos> They brought mops, brooms, some dust pads...<eos> We already have people who do that.<eos> But they want to give it an extra polish.
-There.<eos> -Oh, yes.<eos> -There's something like that, there...<eos> We need to look at it.<eos> This small jellyfish is a coral polyp.<eos> Coral consists of small animals of the family of jellyfish and sea anemones.<eos> Each polyp secretes a calcareous skeleton, a small tower in which it can take shelter.<eos> Tentacles surround a central mouth which also serves as an anus.<eos> Polyps come together to form colonies of very varied forms.<eos> Each polyp is a small mouth that waits for the currents to bring it its food, some plankton, or tiny prey which it captures with the aid of specialised cells.
This is what I was afraid would happen, but it's been coming for a long time.<eos> Ever since Sheridan got back.<eos> Before he went to Z'Ha'Dum he never would've gone up against his own, our own government, like this.<eos> I don't know, maybe he thinks he's Alexander the Great... and maybe he thinks he's John the Baptist... and maybe he wants to take over the whole operation for himself.<eos> That's the part that worries me.<eos> That's the part that made me come back here.<eos> Mars.<eos> I can't believe I'm back on Mars.<eos> Three times before, this place almost killed me.<eos> I swore I'd never give it another chance to finish the job.
The average male penis uses a 16 French Foley catheter.<eos> Those French think of everything.<eos> It refers to the circumference.<eos> One French is a third of a millimeter diameter.<eos> Check the Foley balloon for leaks by injecting some saline.<eos> And you lube up the tip with lidocaine jelly.<eos> Now you are ready to insert applying gentle, constant pressure.<eos> Isn't this a nurse's job?<eos> You need to know how.<eos> So grab that penis and show it who's boss.
Listen, I know it's a long shot, but by any chance, did she find that funny?<eos> So I nodded off a little!<eos> "Nodded off"?<eos> Ross, you were snoring!<eos> My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!<eos> Come on!<eos> Forty-five minutes...<eos> Forty-five minutes, the man talked about strappy-backed dresses.<eos> Okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor "Pitstains" say: "Remember that thing that died a gazillion years ago?<eos> Well, here's a little bone we didn't know it had!"
And much less amusing.<eos> - The box did this?<eos> - A man did this.<eos> But the box called him.<eos> It called to his blood.<eos> His ancestor made the box... and would have unmade all of us.<eos> You've been away too long, Princess.<eos> This is not a room.<eos> This is a holocaust... waiting to wake itself.<eos> If we could just move this whole thing right up... to give it a little more height.
See, in theory, it's possible.<eos> Perpetual light.<eos> Trapped light feeding off its own reflections.<eos> Ihaven'tperfected the light yet.<eos> Something's missing, and I can't make it work.<eos> It'll go for a few seconds... then it'll blink out.<eos> Sometimes a few seconds are more than enough, toy maker.<eos> What did you call me?<eos> You think you don't remember, but your blood knows.<eos> Let it remind you.
Torres to Bridge.<eos> Ensign Kim is dead.<eos> Kes just disappeared.<eos> Disappeared? ! I can't explain it.<eos> She just vanished.<eos> There seems to be some kind of spatial rift right where she disappeared.<eos> Can you determine where it leads?<eos> Stand by, Bridge.<eos> I just threw a piece of conduit into the rift.<eos> Just as it vanished, I detected another oxygen/nitrogen atmosphere.
"I have a feeling" "the name he wrote was intended to be your name."<eos> What does she mean by this?<eos> What is it?<eos> I had a classmate in junior high with the same name. And it was a boy.<eos> And?<eos> That's all.<eos> Was he your first love?<eos> Wasn't anything like that.<eos> There was such a boy. That's all.<eos> When I planted that tree I gave it a name.
I'll never forget that dressage exhibition in senior year prep.<eos> The way you pranced that horse around the ring.<eos> It was like a ballet.<eos> -What kind of horse was that?<eos> -Icelandic pony.<eos> White, wasn't it?<eos> -l can't believe you remember.<eos> -lt made an impression.<eos> And the name....<eos> You'd given it a peculiar name.
Acknowledged.<eos> Mr. Neelix, keep an eye on the Kazon until I get there. I'm on my way.<eos> No problem, Captain.<eos> Pain?<eos> I'm not programmed to feel pain.<eos> Heart rate?<eos> Blood pressure?<eos> Brain patterns?<eos> Computer, analyze emergency medical holographic program.<eos> Has it been altered in any way to include... life signs?
She was an amphetamine addict.<eos> The amphetamines would make her act crazy... and do and say really crazy things.<eos> It had an absolutely devastating effect, I think, on all five of us kids.<eos> It had a devastating effect on me, anyway.<eos> How did your parents get along?<eos> They got along well up until the time I was 9 or 10 years old.<eos> But after Beatie started taking amphetamines to keep her weight down... they had a terrible time.<eos> They were screaming and yelling at each other all the time... morning, noon and night.<eos> - She'd scratch at the old man's face.<eos> - Till it looked like ground hamburger.
You are destroying my reputation!<eos> Here you go, Father.<eos> You dropped your bonsai tree.<eos> That's it! I'm gonna kill you!<eos> Ruin me!<eos> Drunk!<eos> - Wait, Wong, don't!<eos> - Hurt my friends!<eos> That's it!<eos> Just listen! It was stolen off the train and he couldn't get it back!
Take my breast breast which never have filled with some maternal milk.<eos> Because the infant is not taken out from my entrails, but of those of my mother.<eos> Uninterrupted, suck, taste my milk.<eos> You cannot it, because there is not.<eos> The Child is not mine.<eos> I am virgin.<eos> Now, look at the fact that you can have as you want.<eos> Now take me and your bollard will be covered with blood.<eos> In the name of your future offspring, protect my innocence and character sacred of my birth.<eos> It is not you who must lose blood ΅X but it.
You are actually really doing it.<eos> It's not comin' outta me easy.<eos> We are human beings.<eos> Plural.<eos> Each one of us is two separate beings.<eos> There's the outer being, the one we show to the world at large. Inhibited, timid... Often a pathological liar.<eos> And then there's the inner being. The truthful one. Passionate, uninhibited, even lustful.<eos> And most of us keep that inner being hidden away, locked up. But the fiction writer doesn't have to hide it, doesn't have to keep it from anything.<eos> He can let it out, bring it out in the open, let it live.<eos> Hell, he can give it the car keys, let it ride!
He had a brother and a sister to these two children.<eos> But, it's a boy and a lioness.<eos> If the bush has decided daughter Ouara will be Oulé sister.<eos> This is so.<eos> Voice Oulé [...] [...] [...]<eos> A "Babillon."<eos> [...] [...]<eos> Later, with her he learned the secrets does says that the bush that wind or bees.<eos> The bush knows what she does:<eos> that comprising the bees heals all wounds, and one that includes the wind flies with it dangers.
This deserves another toast, David.<eos> We're giving humanity a lesson with the whisky of the enemy.<eos> Long live democratic communism!<eos> You'll see, you'll feel better now.<eos> Next time, take soda with it.<eos> If he's got whisky, he's got soda also.<eos> Hey, you're getting a nice fat ass!<eos> No wonder!<eos> The whisky clue is good.<eos> It's supplied by foreigners.
- What baby? - The Newport millionaire, the baby.<eos> She pocketed the money he gave her for an abortion. Went downtown to a clinic. She ended up working for the doctor.<eos> There's a happy ending, though.<eos> She disappeared with 80,000 of the clinic's money.<eos> - How much of that do you think I saw?<eos> - What was the name of the doctor?<eos> How much you think I'm going to see from this 20 million?<eos> Was the name of the doctor David Lillianfield?<eos> How much do you think she's gonna give her dead mother?<eos> - Was it?
We can't have friends anywhere.<eos> They cause misunderstandings.<eos> When she asked an old lover for money, she found a bloke who had learned the art of men.<eos> Do you know what he did?<eos> He said he didn't have it.<eos> He said it perfectly calmly, like someone covering their old anger.<eos> Well said... and well done.<eos> Men are perfect scrooges.<eos> It's the only role they don't play, that they live fully.<eos> My father, when someone asked for money, even if it were just for matches, looked like a polished wall with no cracks. A wall that was impossible to climb.
We then parked in that space.<eos> She came into the store.<eos> That's when she disappeared.<eos> Did you fight recently?<eos> Wasn't a fight.<eos> It was a thing.<eos> - A thing?<eos> - Don't you have a girlfriend?<eos> Yeah, and if I think something's just a thing you can bet she'll think it's a fight.<eos> I'll make a report, but give it 24 hours-
I didn't.<eos> - He adopted it.<eos> - Adopted it?<eos> I was able to get our friend into a subprogramme.<eos> We leave it in there?<eos> Why not?<eos> It's happy. It's not bothering us anymore.<eos> It seems the humane thing to do.<eos> It's just another new life-form visiting the station.<eos> I'll take care of it. Make sure it gets enough attention and all.
with that ship, bring its cargo back to Federation space.<eos> - What kind of cargo?<eos> - He said it was important.<eos> To the future of the Romulans and the Federation.<eos> You have returned in order to give me this message?<eos> Partly.<eos> To know whether Ambassador Spock's message is being delivered accurately I need to understand something about the messenger.<eos> I was... ready to come back.<eos> Romulus had lost its appeal.<eos> At one time you found it very appealing.
I want to discuss why you insist on languishing in Gotham City as some lowly secretary.<eos> Lowly assistant.<eos> Selina, about that Christmas getaway we planned... I'll be going alone.<eos> Dr. Shaw says I need to be my own person, not an appendage.<eos> Some appendage!<eos> The party never stops on Selina Kyle's answering machine.<eos> I should've let him win that last racquetball game.<eos> Hello Selina Kyle.<eos> We're calling to tell you about exciting, new Gotham Lady perfume.<eos> It makes women feel like women... and the men have no complaints either.
- Yes, that would be nice.<eos> Are you trying to cheat Captain Ron?<eos> No, honest.<eos> What happened?<eos> Nothing. They were playing hide the salami in the shower.<eos> Trip log, day five.<eos> At sea.<eos> So far our adventure has been sanding, painting and polishing.<eos> But the boat is starting to look a lot better.<eos> You can make it look great by cleaning the wood.
No one else seemed to mind.<eos> Kicking an immigration officer on the backside.<eos> You think that's funny?<eos> For those of us with a sense of humor, very.<eos> It was supposed to be a comedy.<eos> You've turned it into a bloody political tract.<eos> We're guests here.<eos> You can't criticize the way it's run.<eos> Syd, I love this country.<eos> I owe it everything.
Why don't you just hang onto them like you do everything else?<eos> -Why don't you just come out and say it? -Fine. Give up your apartment.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> It's rent-controlled. Like that's the reason.<eos> It's not? Well, then, good. You tell me.<eos> Explain me to myself. You're a moron.<eos> You know, you're the one who's hanging onto this apartment thing, not me.<eos> That place is a memory. It's got nothing to do with us. - So get rid of it.<eos> - What time you gotta get up? - A quarter of. I really don't understand why that apartment bothers you so much.<eos> For the same reason you need to keep it so much: It's your security blanket.
Less soot here, more heat.<eos> Lack of discoloration in shattered glass indicates slow burn before explosion.<eos> There's some little dead rat critters here.<eos> Fire originated in this room.<eos> Took its time.<eos> Hung out.<eos> The air ran out.<eos> It couldn't breathe.<eos> It was snuffed. But it wasn't dead.<eos> The trapped heat laid low waiting for someone to give it one big gulp of air.
- Are you kidding?<eos> I just washed my hands!<eos> Cowles, party of ten.<eos> Yes, you're the first ones to arrive.<eos> This way, please.<eos> Hello! - Hello!<eos> - How you doing?<eos> I hurt my back playing tennis.<eos> We saw them together.<eos> - So, I see this film, and I'm gonna give it an 8. As I'm leaving the parking lot,
His nurse is a Ms. Calder whose attentiveness suggests not only that she is his disciple but also that tenderer feelings may be involved.<eos> Most fascinating of all, however, is an extraordinary woman, one who would stand out in any society, the Lady Frances Carfax.<eos> I suppose one would call her modern except that she seems to come from an ancient line of English eccentrics.<eos> Yesterday, as if to confirm the general opinion of her oddity, she declared that she would sail herself to church across the lake.<eos> There was much speculation in the hotel carriage as we traveled towards the charming little lakeside chapel about whether Lady Frances would be as good as her word.<eos> And those of us foolish enough to doubt her were soon rebuked by the sight of a skiff moored in the shallows and by the stern gaze of its captain when she greeted us within.<eos> A surprisingly jolly sermon, Vicar, a lot like a cat.<eos> Well, she appears to care not a jot what her fellow guests make of her and seems quite insensible to the vivid impression she creates wherever she goes.<eos> We were all amused certainly at the sight of her trying to board the skiff, but since she had accomplished the outward journey with such skill, we had no reason to suppose that her return voyage would present her with any greater difficulty<eos> or that it would end in the way that it did.
Manly.<eos> - Monica wants me to wear it.<eos> - Why didn't you say no?<eos> I'm too nice.<eos> Look at this poor guy. His family's probably back in Pakistan waiting for him to send back money.<eos> This is horrible.<eos> She wants me to take an IQ test.<eos> It's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.<eos> No. She's taking this course in education for her master's.<eos> It's part of her research project, so I have to be a guinea pig.
I agree.<eos> But the data matrix within the capsule does not match any standard format.<eos> All we have determined is that the device contains a chemical system for energy encoding.<eos> But the computer can't analyze the specific chemicals.<eos> It must be part of a data-processing system.<eos> What if it's a feedback-loop controller?<eos> The shape suggests rapid chemical processing and storage capacity.<eos> We found it near the escape pod's instrumentation.<eos> It might process the ship's dynamic motions and augment its control inputs.<eos> Let's send it test signals. Make it think the assemblage is operating.
What harm could we do?<eos> I've met my old teacher and I'm showing him where I work.<eos> You could get into trouble.<eos> If there's any trouble, I'll take care of it.<eos> Because my sister is married so to speak, to the General Councilor.<eos> She had Bistagne named vice- president of the canal.<eos> And if Bistagne caused me trouble she'd stifle him with a pillow.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> Here's my canal!<eos> It doesn't look like much but it lets you wash lettuce and your feet in the city.
It's me.<eos> How are you?<eos> My legs hurt.<eos> Did you miss me?<eos> Here I am again.<eos> Just like your father.<eos> Wait till I'm gone.<eos> What would I do without you?<eos> Where's the cat?<eos> Give it some water.
Moustache.<eos> And it was bringing a grey uniform, with gaiters and a hat.<eos> Like a driver?<eos> - Which age did he have?<eos> - I do not know.<eos> But it is curious, it had a very strange voice.<eos> He knows this type that walks thereabouts put on as morning suit? - It of erect nose?<eos> - Erect nose?<eos> Morning suit? Yes, is he a butler?<eos> Well, he had a son, it would be the accomplished face of this so-and-so whom I found.
We're going to kill the last Miranda.<eos> We make a good couple, viejo.<eos> Hey, Miss Winslow!<eos> This is a moving picture!<eos> Is it true you came south in search of your father?<eos> And would you testify to the Senate as to the savagery rampant here?<eos> Do you believe they'll achieve democracy? Don't you think the U.S. Should intervene?<eos> He told me I would forget.<eos> But how could I not remember?<eos> The young general who wanted to change the world the old writer who wanted to bid it farewell.
Now I offer you mine.<eos> Avenge your spirit, but let our granddaughter go.<eos> My death won't be as sweet unless you can taste it.<eos> I remember how good yours tasted to me.<eos> I can still feel my hands around your neck, holding you beneath the water.<eos> It was so good to hear you choke and feel you struggle.<eos> I can still see your eyes staring up at the surface as your miserable soul slipped away.<eos> I'll have you both! Ghede Nimbo... a la cha.<eos> No! Oh, Grandfather! Well, Jack, I buried that mask deep in the back of the vault.<eos> Good, then it and Laotia are never gonna see sunlight again.
It's all right, Lister.<eos> I'm in complete and total control.<eos> Lock!<eos> Lock!<eos> Frankenstein!<eos> Come on, Frankenstein!<eos> Oh, you're getting really big now, you know?<eos> I hope it's not twins.<eos> You've already got all me milk ration.<eos> When the baby cat comes, we'll give it water and pretend it's milk.
You've earned the right to sit in those chairs.<eos> That sound again.<eos> - Another weapon.<eos> - We must stop the system.<eos> - I need the program schematic.<eos> - You've got it.<eos> Is it possible to readjust the targeting sequence?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> It wouldn't be much good without it.<eos> - Give it a new target.
Close the door, George.<eos> What was he?<eos> Sit and listen.<eos> Their heads! When they saw the kidney ...<eos> They did not know what to say or what to think!<eos> They were baffled.<eos> I wish I had your vocabulary.<eos> So, will you publish the article on the prince?<eos> The power of the press, my friend, it is the threat it poses.<eos> Hello, Bates. It starts in the sedition?
Without further ado, I wanna welcome...<eos> If I'm gonna lose, I'd like to lose doing something.<eos> So here he is, the next U.S. representative... ... from the California 47th Congressional District.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> The president of the United States is backstage.<eos> He'll be out here in a minute.<eos> He'll be out in a minute because, of course he's monitoring our troops in Kundu.<eos> But I wanted to say that yesterday the Republicans rolled out their tax plan.<eos> Do not let this president off this stage until he's told you his.
There it is.<eos> Tested positive six months ago.<eos> I can't believe that porn actors' monthly health records are on the Internet. Yeah, right.<eos> The rule is, the actor tests positive twice, they go on permanent quarantine.<eos> That's why she ended up in that snuff film.<eos> She got bounced out of regular porn.<eos> Walked right into her own death scene.<eos> The thing is... porn director may have, too.<eos> This would be a pretty cool little truck if it weren't for the shiny new toolbox. Yeah.<eos> And it might be his.
If it comes to that, someone will leave here missing an ear or not being able to fuck any more.<eos> One reason, now that you let me know what you think I'm made of.<eos> Are you a fatalist, Jerry?<eos> Uh, I never really thought about it.<eos> When you do think about it, about that afternoon you smashed into my life, into my car, ever think there's anything to that?<eos> I honestly never thought about it.<eos> Because of that afternoon, I'm doomed to remember a backwards inmate with a paper clipping.<eos> When you're in jail, a small box... you learn a lot about the fella you're in a cage with.<eos> I grew to love that boy, like he was my own son.<eos> But he was his.
What has lots of water above And a big fire below?<eos> Bathtub.<eos> Don't change the riddle.<eos> Then what is it?<eos> One-eyed goblin!<eos> Hey, that was last week's answer.<eos> So, I got it?<eos> Incredible. He can solve Tomo's whacky riddles.<eos> Sukemasa, who told you the answer?<eos> Tomo, you must be approaching His intelligence level.
So?<eos> DNA results.<eos> Erm... 16 samples from the apartment walls and one we just took from the guy's arm.<eos> This cannot be right.<eos> Hey, I always double-check your stuff.<eos> - All the results point one way.<eos> - What about the blood on the lamp?<eos> That is my next run. Just a little backlogged.<eos> Well, get through it.<eos> I thought you said the blood on those walls couldn't be his.
You found something.<eos> Proof.<eos> Of what?<eos> - My father wasn't murdered.<eos> - But not for lack of trying.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Are you saying it was an accident?<eos> We're saying he's not dead.<eos> It starts with a bloodstain we found in my father's house.<eos> - We've had it tested. The blood wasn't his.
You're a good kisser, but your sweater smells like formalin.<eos> Are you coming to the pond tomorrow?<eos> Damned corpses!<eos> I'm dead tired!<eos> I took part in a contest and wrote the second best paper.<eos> How did you get accepted here in Heidelberg?<eos> I wrote the best paper.<eos> In the Robert Koch Contest for the advanced semester?<eos> This year, I won for the third time.<eos> Do you think a man can still get it up when he finds out that my IQ is 50 points higher than his is?
Because you know you're gonna lose, and we're gonna look bad winning.<eos> I reject maintaining free speech through government regulation.<eos> - What? Reject whatever you want.<eos> This was a fool's errand for me and the president knew it.<eos> This was a test balloon, an "out of curiosity, what if" meeting.<eos> - But you've got me on board.<eos> - Steve, we've got a caucus.<eos> We gotta go.<eos> - I'm going to lunch.<eos> - The president won't eat his.
She got an abortion behind your back, without telling you.<eos> I forget what abortion is.<eos> It's when the baby goes to Heaven without ever getting born.<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> You aim for the doctor, but you got the son instead.<eos> - No, I aimed for the son.<eos> - You took out the kid on purpose?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Now that doctor knows how I feel.<eos> He killed my baby, I killed his.
So they've got some armed guards?<eos> A lot of them.<eos> What's that damn small- town sheriff do about it?<eos> Nothing. Not a damn thing.<eos> You're the father, aren't you?<eos> Your boy's in there.<eos> No, no.<eos> You've got that wrong.<eos> My son isn't in there.<eos> How much would you tack on to get my boy out the same time as his?
You are so quick to despair.<eos> You are not the only person in the world who has had tragedy in their lives.<eos> Did you know that Curtis had a son?<eos> Curtis had a son?<eos> Before Curtis came to us at St. Helen of the Blessed Shroud he had a musical group that toured juke joints in the Midwest.<eos> In one town, Curtis had an affair with a married woman.<eos> Go, Curtis.<eos> I mean, that's terrible.<eos> That's what I thought you meant.<eos> The woman became pregnant and decided to stay with her husband never telling him that the boy child wasn't his.
4:00 already. I got to call that guy, the darn guy. Darn it.<eos> -The darn guy, about the thing with the.... The other guy.<eos> Get in here.<eos> Good cover, Ray. You're brilliant at this.<eos> My father's about to ask me to go to this war thing.<eos> Tell him you can't do it.<eos> I can't just turn him down.<eos> No, I got to tell him I'm going somewhere else.<eos> You are going somewhere else. You're going to the baby shower.<eos> What if I tell him I'm going to the baby shower? He goes to his thing, you go to your thing... and I make sure that things are good here.
- Bet that's happening a lot these days.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> You're a guard from the prison.<eos> - I'm off duty.<eos> - It's nothing personal... but it's just guards aren't high on my list of dinner companions.<eos> I just shared a meal with your father.<eos> He misses you very much.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Fate.<eos> And I don't think your father deserves his.
Thanks.<eos> Looks like quite a load.<eos> I don't usually bring a truckload of bees home.<eos> But, as you know, things haven't been too normal around here lately.<eos> What's the word for beekeeper?<eos> Apiary?<eos> Apiarist?<eos> Beekeeper is easier.<eos> Somebody told me they used to make a lot of honey around here.<eos> I learned from my dad... and he learned from his.
Me too!<eos> Good riddance!<eos> What a bore!<eos> It's awful here now!<eos> - I'm going back to italy. - Why?<eos> I told you to take it easy.<eos> Careful, i said. Be gentle! But you strut around with your flies wide open!<eos> This time, your goose is cooked.<eos> Why?<eos> Your father, yours and his.
All that lives must die, passing through nature to eternity.<eos> Ay, madam, it is common.<eos> If it be, why seems it so particular with thee?<eos> Seems, madam?<eos> Nay, it is.<eos> I know not "seems. "<eos> 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother nor customary suits of solemn black, nor windy suspiration of forced breath no, nor the fruitful river in the eye, nor the dejected havior of the visage together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief that can denote me truly.<eos> These indeed "seem" for they are actions that a man might play.<eos> But I have that within which passeth show. These but the trappings and the suits of woe.<eos> 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father. But you must know your father lost a father. That father lost, lost his.
Don't be afraid, mom.<eos> It's only a storm.<eos> If you say so.<eos> It's just an atmospheric disturbance, characterized by electrical phenomena... that flame up the clouds, causing the rain.<eos> Nothing else.<eos> Ah?<eos> It's Dad.<eos> Oh... WHY IS MOM IN MY BED?<eos> Why is mom in my bed? Why?<eos> Actually, if Mom is in my bed, it's because Dad is no longer in his.
It's only a storm.<eos> If you say so.<eos> It's just an atmospheric disturbance, characterized by electrical phenomena... that flame up the clouds, causing the rain.<eos> Nothing else.<eos> Ah?<eos> It's Dad.<eos> Oh... WHY IS MOM IN MY BED?<eos> Why is mom in my bed? Why?<eos> Actually, if Mom is in my bed, it's because Dad is no longer in his.<eos> So why is Dad no longer in his?
I will write to my father, and it will summon my uncle, the cardinal Fespichi Who is sure to be the next pope.<eos> I will allow you to see my New Will... Writes on ivoire paper of elephant to ink crimson extracted of the cochineal...<eos> Cochineal!<eos> Brazil... and Helen's eyelashes...<eos> How itself do it can that a so ugly woman Donne birth to so beautiful children?<eos> It is so beautiful!<eos> Hold it well.<eos> A woman of this age has not the right to give birth to a so beautiful child.<eos> This child is it really my brother?<eos> This child is it really his?
Even if you see, you won't understand.<eos> Fine. Then why did you consult with me and team up with me?<eos> Father recognized the signs in mother when she was around 8 months pregnant.<eos> When her strong desire to give birth to her own child was about to be fulfilled, she was overwhelmed with the uneasiness called tokophobia.<eos> Through the phone, she started talking with me, who lurked within her body.<eos> "Help me, Aki...<eos> Help me."<eos> While screaming that, she continued to fight with the uneasiness of pondering the coming birth of the important child.<eos> But father was still shaken. He started having wild delusions.<eos> He wondered if the child wasn't his.
So it's all a charade then.<eos> Law and justice.<eos> When the system's threatened, they'll do anything to defend it.<eos> That means that that black detainee...<eos> - What was his name?<eos> - Mabaso.<eos> Mabaso.<eos> Means that he... gave his life... for a charade?<eos> He knew, like we all know, that with enough black bodies... they won't be able to play that game.<eos> So he just added his.
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control.<eos> Have you, have you arranged our supplies?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> But where are we going?<eos> This map will show you.<eos> It was drawn by...<eos> Welcome to Iskenderun.<eos> The director of the Museum of Antiquities has sent a car for you.<eos> Well, your servant, sir.<eos> And I am his.
Who hired you?<eos> Where do they plan to take Ashford?<eos> Details!<eos> I've got the number of the Swiss safety deposit box.<eos> I've got the map and the box number stashed across the way.<eos> Come on. I'll give you all the names.<eos> Well, what do you know?<eos> Hook, line and sinker.<eos> The commandant's plan was working just fine.<eos> And if his was working, so was mine.
- Especially...<eos> - How's it going?<eos> Ready for inspection.<eos> Well, I'm going for coffee.<eos> Anybody else?<eos> I may join you in a minute, Joe.<eos> Let's see.<eos> - Where'd you learn to clean a gun?<eos> - My dad taught me.<eos> That was his.
You make it sound like a story.<eos> The fact that it sounds like a story has nothing to do with me.<eos> I'm afraid it succeeds on its own.<eos> Whose side are you on anyway?<eos> Yours, of course.<eos> I just want to be sure that you know what it is you're up against.<eos> Now, the county prosecutor has a respectable case in the making.<eos> Even if the biker had a record, your fingerprints are on the gun.<eos> It's unregistered.<eos> There's no way to prove it was his.
The King.<eos> The King.<eos> Out!<eos> -What is it, lady?<eos> -A boy, sir.<eos> -Send the girl away.<eos> -She's only a child.<eos> -Out! -Go, Morgana.<eos> She watches me with her father's eyes.<eos> Is it mine or his?
Good luck to you.<eos> - He's still upset. - Who cares?<eos> Protect that eye.<eos> No matter what happens, don't go back to fighting' southpaw till I tell ya.<eos> Get him.<eos> - Good luck.<eos> - He'll try to kill you quick.<eos> If you get through this first round, then he's ours.<eos> Rocky Balboa prays in his corner.<eos> The champion dancing over in his.
No, no, no, no, ma'am, those are on me.<eos> - Thank you!<eos> - Merry Christmas.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> Mrs Harmon, how can I help you today?<eos> A loaf of Holly's wonderful bread.<eos> - Ah. - And a box of cupcakes, please.<eos> We're having the girls over for mahjong tonight.<eos> Mmm! - I'll tell you a little secret.<eos> I've added a couple of extras because I am sure Bertyl and Margie will be coming over tonight, and they can never eat just one of Holly's cupcakes.
I'm gonna kill now, huh?<eos> Tried once already.<eos> Two's the charm now.<eos> - [Screaming]<eos> - You!<eos> It would be my pleasure to shoot you.<eos> He is not dead.<eos> That he is still here is a testament to the hardness of his head.<eos> There's blood on it, and hair.<eos> The marks on her body, this is what they're from.
Ok.<eos> So what were you running, some corporate espionage outfit?<eos> Romantic services.<eos> Boy meets girl thanks to...<eos> "in-the-field assistance".<eos> You coached dorks whilst they cruised singles bars.<eos> Singles bars are depressing. Wed do regular bars and clubs.<eos> But at Christmas time... wed gate-crash office parties.<eos> See, there's this dynamic to Christmas work parties.<eos> All the attractive women have been surrounded by regulation office ass-clowns for the whole year, and now they want to let their hair down.
Yeah, I guess you don't really like parties either.<eos> The noise wrecks it for me.<eos> All the talking and talking, it never fucking stops.<eos> Ok, she curses, so should you.<eos> Shit, fucking,<eos> I fucking always totally think that its fucking shit. You know?<eos> I can't think through all the babble.<eos> I only got through it last year because I was on drugs.<eos> I'm sorry, whats that? Whats that?<eos> Just, like, pills, but they must've been pretty strong because I actually enjoyed myself.
No.<eos> We are not here searching for dead hubby, are we?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Shelter's this way.<eos> Get going.<eos> It's so green.<eos> I never seen a sky look like that.<eos> I've only seen tornadoes on TV.<eos> I don't like tornadoes.<eos> I'm pretty sure they don't like me either.
Hello, Auggie.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Hey, got a sec? Just.<eos> What's up?<eos> Who do you know at the Russian embassy?<eos> I know everyone.<eos> But I have a relationship in the cultural attache's office, why?<eos> I need you to meet with them.<eos> Did you like the flowers? Yeah.<eos> They're beautiful.
Catch us up, Addie.<eos> Armored transport bus carrying four Naval Brig detainees from New Orleans to Charleston crossed over the double yellow until point of impact.<eos> Rolled once landed here.<eos> Marshals are still sifting through the wreckage, but, so far, we have three dead, three unaccounted for.<eos> We're waiting for the prison manifest to confirm names.<eos> Any witnesses?<eos> The girls were making a pilgrimage to New Orleans when the bus nearly hit them head-on.<eos> Bourbon Street or bust.<eos> Bust, clearly.<eos> They pull over to see if they could help, that's when the prisoners jacked their car and took off.
She's on her way.<eos> She's gonna be mad.<eos> She told me not to come here.<eos> She said it was dangerous.<eos> Probably right.<eos> I was setting up my platoons when I heard shouting.<eos> Then shots.<eos> I imagine that was scary.<eos> I hid in the cupboard.<eos> But the voices, they got closer.
Just need something to help me focus.<eos> Coffee.<eos> No, no.<eos> Cigarettes.<eos> [blows smoke] No, tequila!<eos> Ah, no, I just need the right music... [classical music] to do drugs to.<eos> Sarah Lynn, I know things got kind of out of hand last time when I tried to make you stop doing drugs.<eos> So I just want to thank you for coming over this time to give me drugs.<eos> Well, you can't go wrong with Dr. Hu's drugs.<eos> They're from another dimension.
Gotta take this.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> BoJack Horseman? We have some very delicate pictures you might have an interest in not getting into the wrong hands.<eos> I am very happy with my current - long distance provider, thank you.<eos> - What?<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm having lunch with my friend.<eos> But if you just listen...<eos> All right, gang, when Virgil Van Cleef gets here, look alive.<eos> This could be Todd's big break, so clap really hard and laugh at all the jokes, even if they're not funny, but also, be careful, because a lot of things you might think are jokes
There was no oxy in his system.<eos> It may not have been in his system when he died. Sam was using again.<eos> It was that damn protest group he got involved with in college.<eos> What protest group?<eos> Stand Up To The System.<eos> They're... "Occupy Wall Street" types.<eos> He changed after he met them.<eos> Became agitated.<eos> The fights your neighbors heard?<eos> Were they about this group?
You sure about that?<eos> Because your texts sound more like you wanna hang out, and she wants you to stop texting her phone.<eos> One of the texts actually said, "stop texting my phone, Jordan."<eos> We got in a tiny fight.<eos> So what?<eos> Is this coming from Allison or from her dad?<eos> Did you do something to those girls?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean they're missing, Jordan.
- Well, judging by this beautiful young lady, I'd say it's been at least 16 months?<eos> - You were always quick with numbers.<eos> This is sashi. [Baby laughs]<eos> - You are adorable.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - I am so happy for you, divya.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> - Well, since you asked,<eos> I'm just leaving my lawyer's office.<eos> I'm dealing with a custody battle, and it seems things are going to get more difficult before they get easier.
- No.<eos> No!<eos> Are you...<eos> - Yeah, I'm okay.<eos> That doesn't look good.<eos> Hold this really tight.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Hey, Russell.<eos> Have you heard from the girls?<eos> Yeah, they're okay.
Police said that the driver lost control of the car, and Philip... he died.<eos> A lot of my clients are, uh... haunted by the people they've hurt with their crimes.<eos> What about you?<eos> You mean am I haunted by Misaki?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Are you?<eos> It's, um... it's funny you'd ask that.<eos> What kind of magazine story did you say you were writing?<eos> About how, um, people survive the loss of a child.<eos> And how they find the strength to move on.
Blake, you put too much stock in the things people say when they're tipsy.<eos> Really?<eos> Where'd you get this?<eos> Harvard Assistants' Mafia.<eos> Three words you rarely hear strung together.<eos> Yet they constitute a thing.<eos> Nice work.<eos> Ma'am, the African Union forces have bogged down.<eos> Uh, define "bogged down."<eos> They're inside the RWA, but they haven't advanced in the last hour.

But?<eos> But I decided to give Prime Minister Saigal more time in office.<eos> See if he's still barking anti-Americanisms when he's not running as India's great nationalist hope.<eos> Yeah, but you see, that's the reason to go.<eos> If you get in early, you establish a rapport.<eos> Ted here is, uh, an early adopter when it comes to India.<eos> Well, my company Hepanza Chemical has a couple of garment dye factories in Uttar Pradesh.<eos> So, you must be thrilled by Prime Minister Saigal's vow to ramp up India's native manufacturing.<eos> DALTON: Ventures like Hepanza are crucial to U.S. economic stake in India.<eos> Right now, they're under fire.
What?<eos> Your text said it was an emergency.<eos> Wait, did you run all the way here?<eos> No, no, I'm just, I'm just, I'm extremely out of shape.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> I came home today after the speech of my life and I got super depressed when I realized the only person I had to share it with was Gross Tony.<eos> So, you're here because you hate your roommate?<eos> I can't get a drink tonight.<eos> I'm not here for a drink.<eos> I'm here because until today, I've lived my entire life doing things because they're easy.
Well, that specific type of movement-- porpoising-- tends to cause vomiting.<eos> Porpoising--isn't it going up and down on a wave or like a roller coaster?<eos> Yes, as opposed to side-to-side movement.<eos> And what would cause porpoising?<eos> Being caught in the jetstream of another plane, but there was no other flight nearby.<eos> Is there something else, something mechanical, perhaps?<eos> A deployment of the slats mid-air.<eos> You mean the flaps.<eos> The flaps are on the back of the wing.<eos> The slats are similar, but they're on the leading edge.

You got a visitor.<eos> Johnny, I told you not to bother me unless you bring me breakfast.<eos> What did you mean when you said my son's possessed?<eos> Every one of these parents had a little nipper that was exhibiting the exact same behavior as Henry.<eos> What you said was true.<eos> Something's not right.<eos> Not all souls go gently into the night.<eos> A violent death can leave behind a bewildered or traumatized soul.<eos> Child spirits are the worst.<eos> They act out, like all brats... only their tantrums end in blood.
Seriously. You try having visions like mine, and see if you're still interested in dabbling.<eos> I need more control, not less.<eos> Huh. Well, sometimes control is about letting go.<eos> Psychic energy is all around us.<eos> It's like a network.<eos> You have the ability to travel that network.<eos> But you have to lower your walls first.<eos> And then you'll be able to see how far you can really go.<eos> I see coins.<eos> They're falling all around us.
Well, I'm sorry, Danny.<eos> I should have never forced you to introduce me to your mother.<eos> God, so this is what it feels like to be wrong.<eos> I don't like it.<eos> It was a valiant effort, but ma and girlfriends, they don't mix.<eos> Yeah, but I didn't wanna be just another one of your girlfriends, Danny.<eos> I wanted to be different.<eos> You are different.<eos> You're very different.<eos> My old girlfriends, they loved to work out.

If I do, will you immediately leave my classroom?<eos> Yes. Hm, 32%.<eos> I'm telling you, Churchy, that boy's got the potential to go all the way, to Cambridge even.<eos> Hmm. On a coach trip, maybe.<eos> Mr Barber, what are you doing?<eos> What?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> It's a pre-emptive strike.<eos> What? Blow the leaves off the tree before they fall, beat them at their own game.
So that's it?<eos> I was with him the whole time.<eos> You can put me on the box if you'd like.<eos> If I wanted to give my daughter a polygraph, I'd have done it back when you discovered beer.<eos> So listen, what's the story with you and this guy, anyway?<eos> He's just my trainer.<eos> Who you went to dinner with?<eos> As friends.<eos> But I know him, and he would never do something like this.<eos> Well, we've got to hold him here till the coroner's official findings come back, and then if they're consistent with his story, we'll cut him loose.
It's nice to see.<eos> I think you may have broken my wrist.<eos> But I'm not mad, and I will tell Zelda fo' definite that you kicked my ass.<eos> Stu, I just got off the phone with Zelda.<eos> She likes the sweet, sensitive type.<eos> [Both laugh]<eos> - Sounds like dissonance.<eos> - What?<eos> There's what people say they want in a mate and what they actually click on... dissonance.<eos> Women on our site say they want sweet and sensitive, but they click on guys with abs and gelled hair.
Seriously.<eos> I'll tell you who, a guy who's single at the moment and would appreciate any kind of face time.<eos> Let's go, single guy.<eos> Dead Navy officer on the Ellipse.<eos> There have been five muggings in the area in the past two weeks.<eos> Yeah, I heard it on the news.<eos> Up until now, no one's been hurt, let alone killed.<eos> We've been calling the perp "the Polite Mugger."<eos> Even though he held a knife on them, all the victims commented on how courteous and apologetic he was.<eos> They describe him?
All right.<eos> That's a great start.<eos> We've got art, and we've got animals.<eos> Those are two great topics to start a conversation with.<eos> So you're good.<eos> I still don't understand how she could like horses more than lizards.<eos> How come?<eos> Horses are inferior.<eos> Okay, good point, but, Max, women are mysterious creatures.<eos> They're not always gonna like exactly what you like.
I want to stop crying!<eos> That's what I want!<eos> What time is dinner with Rogelio?<eos> Oh, honey, let me call him.<eos> We'll cancel.<eos> No, no, I don't want that.<eos> It means he's finally listening to me about toning down the over-the-top gestures.<eos> Besides, I think it's sweet he wants us to meet his stepdaughters.<eos> Former stepdaughters.<eos> Hopefully, they're not as bitchy as their mom.
My daughter.<eos> Who tomorrow will be a teacher.<eos> Just, like, a student teacher.<eos> I believe teaching is one of the most noble professions in the world.<eos> So, are you really a pregnant virgin?<eos> Well, they were asking about the circumstance, and I did not want them to get the wrong idea about you. Or your incredible purity.<eos> Why haven't you swiped your "V" card?<eos> Can't find someone to have sex with you?<eos> Don't let those girls get to you.<eos> They're mean like their mom.
You will have no conduct issues with me.<eos> Good.<eos> And really, how bad could a group of teenagers really be?<eos> And here's your classroom.<eos> Oh.<eos> Girls, Sister, please welcome your new Teacher<eos> Ms. Villanueva.<eos> Oh, uh, those girls in the back, I know them actually.<eos> Valeria and Victoria?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - They just transferred.
She's right.<eos> I heard.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Whatever.<eos> You got to put those girls in their place.<eos> You want me to help?<eos> I can go after their mom.<eos> No, stop.<eos> No one's going after anyone.<eos> The girls are clearly acting out because they're jealous.
- Thanks.<eos> - Oh...<eos> It was kind of surreal.<eos> I was so nervous.<eos> Well, you didn't look it.<eos> You belonged up there.<eos> Thank you, baby.<eos> So we didn't even get to talk.<eos> The twins really confessed?<eos> Yeah, they did.
Do you remember the name?<eos> St. Gabriella's.<eos> Nick was right.<eos> The killer has added taking crime scene photos to his M.O.<eos> DNA from the blood at the crime scene didn't pop on CODIS.<eos> But now that we have a face, maybe it can help us get a name from another database.<eos> You got anything?<eos> Well, the first images on some of the rolls all look the same.<eos> As if the killer, when loading the camera, advanced the film and accidentally popped off a few exposures at the head.<eos> And they're blurry, but doesn't this look like an "H" to you?
Yeah.<eos> Last time, the message was in the bird's-eye view of the crime scene.<eos> All these cameras.<eos> How about...<eos> we connect the dots.<eos> Here's the constellation.<eos> Right?<eos> It's Virgo.<eos> The virgin.<eos> The killer said that the women were chosen because they were "seemingly innocent," virginal.

What are we gonna do?<eos> What the hell are you doing to these people?<eos> It's OK.<eos> Turn her over! Let's go!<eos> Saving their lives.<eos> Artificial circadian light cycles, recycled air, repetitive diets, they wear on the immune system.<eos> The shots are merely inoculations.<eos> Then what happened to Ophelia?<eos> An allergic reaction when she took the shot meant for Christa.<eos> They're customized to each individual crew member's needs.
They didn't have you back then!<eos> Anyway, Mr. Jean Fréville, Sylvain Poupart, and our homeless lady. 3 dead, probably the same motive.<eos> Whatever Mr. Jean was hiding.<eos> There we go!<eos> It should be there.<eos> There's still a trace.<eos> The seller never told me how it happened.<eos> To think there was a murder here... gives me goose bumps.<eos> Where are the photos from?<eos> They were here when I bought it.
He was an accountant at the Fréville foundry until '51.<eos> And then?<eos> He joined the Viet Minh.<eos> And this is where it's interesting.<eos> He died in Hue, before the end of the war, tortured by French mercenaries.<eos> - The Black Dragons!<eos> - Exactly.<eos> How did you find out?<eos> The sisters in Cholon, near Saigon.<eos> They took in Mai Binh's wife and their daughter.
One beer?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And...<eos> When did you consume this beer?<eos> Uh, after my release.<eos> There was a celebration with a few coworkers.<eos> Mm... was this at a bar?<eos> No, at my apartment.<eos> You said this was a celebration with a few people.<eos> And who were they?
Ok. Drive safe.<eos> Hi. Hey, buddy, I didn't hear you.<eos> You can't sleep?<eos> Can you read me a story?<eos> How about I tell you a story tonight?<eos> A brand-new one? Ok.<eos> Mmm. Come here.<eos> Come here, buddy.<eos> This story is about two sisters who loved each other very much.<eos> They lived together on a farm out in the countryside with lots of animals.

It was the first thing that worked.<eos> Do you want me to cancel it or...<eos> No, um... patch the feed in here.<eos> Madam Secretary.<eos> What an unexpected pleasure.<eos> General, it's time we had a talk.<eos> By all means.<eos> We have so much to discuss.<eos> But where are your beautiful legs?<eos> They're under the table, where they're going to stay.
You've never even met him.<eos> His name is Win, for crying out loud.<eos> You really want to be the mother of Winthrop the Third?<eos> The fourth, actually, and, yes, I do.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> What?<eos> Let's get started.<eos> NADINE: Blake, would you excuse us, please?<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Your personal lives are your own affair, but they become my business when they interfere with the operation of this office.
No, I have to make some changes.<eos> Starting now.<eos> But... but not right now.<eos> You go for a jog right this second, I don't think you'd ever be able to walk again.<eos> I did mention not wanting to be punched, didn't I?<eos> Yeah, uh, but it's good cardio.<eos> Oh, like that really hurt.<eos> That hurt?<eos> The ABCs of trauma are a handy tool for keeping a patient alive.<eos> But they're only a starting point.
It's inoperable.<eos> I thought I had longer, but it's growing.<eos> Soon, I will show symptoms, and after that, I will die.<eos> Who knows about this?<eos> Hunt?<eos> Uh, anyone?<eos> Fetal surgery is a new field.<eos> The few of us who are practicing it are basically inventing it as we go along.<eos> The things I know, the things I scribble down in the margins, no one has them.<eos> They're not in any textbook.
I was, like-- screw them, right?<eos> I mean, like TJ said, they don't control me.<eos> But they do.<eos> He believed in me.<eos> And they murdered him because he was trying to help me change my life.<eos> Are you sure Natalie doesn't know who's running this ring?<eos> Swears she doesn't.<eos> Ugly business.<eos> Luring these girls with money and the high life.<eos> Scaring them when they want to get out.
Now tell them you are satisfied.<eos> Manage them, and I will manage my wife.<eos> There will need to be some satisfaction, if you want all of this to go away.<eos> No more bloodshed.<eos> Land.<eos> Of my choosing.<eos> Nostradamus and the guards have been freed.<eos> You were brilliant.<eos> And he didn't ask to see the contents of the letters?<eos> I burned them before he could see they were forged.
Hey! We got a charity event to get to, man.<eos> You in training.<eos> I see you, Missy.<eos> Looking perfect as always.<eos> Just what I do.<eos> I actually need gloss.<eos> And you need pants.<eos> Where are the girls?<eos> They where my pants at.<eos> Locked in my bedroom taking too long to put on the new gowns that they done bought with too much of my new money.

What did I tell you about rockin' brand names in public?<eos> Sharpie the logos till we close the deal for you to wear it, especially the shoes.<eos> All right, then close me a sneaker deal.<eos> Wait, what just happened?<eos> - See that command tent? - Hey, yeah.<eos> Is that me?<eos> - That's the top half of you.<eos> - Where are my legs?<eos> Hang on.<eos> They coming.
I don't want to see them.<eos> I'd rather hang out here with you guys.<eos> Hit me with one of those macaroons.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yup, totally fine.<eos> I hope you're hungry, 'cause we found some--<eos> We found some berries.<eos> Ugh. Looks like you got some bad berries.<eos> So much for living off the land.<eos> They're fine. I just ate too many of them because they're so-- so delicious.
Shall we?<eos> Dad.<eos> Seriously, how bright does that have to be?<eos> They're eyeballs.<eos> Move on.<eos> So no clue as to where Bo is?<eos> I was she-handled by Valkyries, dragged out before I could see.<eos> What should we do?<eos> First, we make sure that you're okay.<eos> Dyson's very likely back at the gates by now, making sure that they stay open for Bo.
Bo's a motherfae'n ghost.<eos> Yeah, it would appear so.<eos> More vodka.<eos> I wouldn't do that.<eos> Unless you're some sort of bearded Valkyrie I haven't heard of, you shouldn't even be seeing this.<eos> I've seen a lot of things I shouldn't have.<eos> But if you close this gate, you may never see anything again.<eos> I think you're confused about who can hurt who here.<eos> You want me to call my sisters?<eos> If they look anything like you, be my guest.
I can't believe you betrayed Bo.<eos> Again.<eos> I went to help.<eos> I got activated by him, like some sleeper cell.<eos> And don't change the subject!<eos> You were just sucking face with my very evil sister.<eos> Sister?<eos> Oh that's... oh right!<eos> She took my phone.<eos> Dyson, you need to get back to the Valhalla gates, and quick, before they close, it's Bo's only way out.
Oh, well, you can't take it with you, right?<eos> That's what he said!<eos> And since when does a retired shop teacher hand out legal advice?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe he's a big fan of Judge Judy.<eos> You know what else? What?<eos> His hands.<eos> His hands?<eos> His hands were smooth.<eos> They're beautiful.

We got no shotgun and no hollow core slugs-- nothing.<eos> All right, we're striking out in here, too.<eos> But I'm thinking he wouldn't have been stupid enough to leave the murder weapon here.<eos> All right, look, we have got to tie Barber directly to this murder or our 100K theory is out the window.<eos> Hey, guys, I found this on his laptop.<eos> All right, they're photos of the Kealoha house.<eos> That's right.<eos> So he did some recon beforehand-- so what?<eos> Yes, but he didn't take these pictures.<eos> They were e-mailed to him.
Word has it...<eos> You're driving, er, quite aggressively.<eos> Yeah, well, it's probably 'cause I'm gonna be aggressively late to work again.<eos> If I don't get a story soon, I'll be aggressively demoted out the door.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> There's a leaf in there.<eos> It's making a very... like a pht, pht, pht, pht!<eos> It's really, I dunno, disconcerting.<eos> Well, how do you like head-on collisions?<eos> They're not too disconcerting for you?
Jesse Banks?<eos> You got any information on him?<eos> He needs a support person in there with him.<eos> Is Jesse Banks back there?<eos> Fuckin' bastards!<eos> Thank you.<eos> I haven't done anything yet.<eos> Are you sure, if the other guy really pushed him,<eos> Jesse wouldn't retaliate?<eos> I've got more than 20 years' experience with his meltdowns, and they're not pretty, but they don't look like that.
Fuck.<eos> G'day.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Yeah, we have a mutual acquaintance, Nico Gaelle.<eos> But I'm having trouble finding him.<eos> Mr Malik, is everything OK?<eos> Tell them to go away.<eos> Everything's fine, Umar.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So you probably know there was some difficulties but they can be sorted.
Boom.<eos> I already knew that apartment 5C was empty.<eos> Aim higher.<eos> [Sighs] What's your problem?<eos> You're wasting my time.<eos> It's not like I can get into an empty apartment.<eos> - Well, I can.<eos> - How?<eos> My moms are property whores.<eos> They have a superstar realtor on retainer.
Terrorists have a flair for drama.<eos> It's not just about killing;<eos> it's about sending a message.<eos> Look, your murder's too quiet.<eos> I think you're going down the wrong path.<eos> I agree.<eos> Gibbs.<eos> Hey, McGee.<eos> How are the ribs?<eos> They feel like they've been completely destroyed.
Or what?<eos> He said it's gonna be my blood next.<eos> They're going to hurt us.<eos> I am gonna kill them.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Can I show you something, sir?<eos> Sure.<eos> Cause of death in each one of these cases is what I would call Portland-esque, and by that, I mean it's weird.<eos> We have an assortment of exploding stomachs, throats ripped open, bodies cut in half, limbs chewed off, and so forth, but they have one thing in common.<eos> They were all handled by Burkhardt and Griffin.
The Post says they're extracting audio, video, photographs, emails, documents, and connection logs that enable analysts to track a person's movements and contacts over time.<eos> Let's discuss this latest revelation... they're coming out fast. Bill Binney, former official of the NSA who quit back in 2001, you were angry over what was going on, you are known as a whistleblower right now.<eos> Bill, what do you think about this Washington Post story?<eos> Well, I assume it's just a continuation of what they've been doing all along.<eos> So you're not surprised.<eos> Do you have any idea who is leaking this information?<eos> I don't know who leaked this. I have no doubt that the administration will launch an investigation, not into who approved these programs but into who leaked the information.<eos> I'm not shocked the companies are denying it, - I don't assume...<eos> - Do you believe them?<eos> There may be some technical basis on which they can say that we are not actively collaborating or they don't have what we consider in our own definition to be direct access to our servers but what I do know is that I've talked to more than one person
The floor is yours, for the time that you deem necessary.<eos> Thank you and hello.<eos> First of all, Americans' justification for everything since the September 11 attacks is terrorism.<eos> Everything is in the name of national security, to protect our population.<eos> In reality, it's the opposite.<eos> A lot of the documents have nothing to do with terrorism or national security, but with competition between countries, and with companies' industrial, financial, or economic issues.<eos> Secondly, there's XKeyscore.<eos> When we first started publishing articles, the US government's defense was that it was not invading the content of communications, just taking the metadata.<eos> That means the names of the people talking, who is calling whom, call durations.<eos> But if I know all the people you are communicating with, and everyone they are communicating with, where you are when you are communicating, the call duration and the location, then I can learn a lot about your personality,
- Okay, all right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hello, Mr. Binney.<eos> How are you?<eos> Good to see you again.<eos> Nice to meet you again, yes.<eos> It is my pleasure to be here. I feel that it's important to testify about what's really going on behind the scenes in the intelligence communities around the world. Not just in NSA.<eos> All those programs that Edward Snowden has exposed fundamentally are ways of acquiring information.<eos> Every dictatorship down through history has always done that.<eos> One of the first things they need to do is try to acquire knowledge of their population. And that's exactly what these programs do.
- Huh. - Gentlemen.<eos> Is there an elevator?<eos> Is this a walk-up?<eos> Hope it's an elevator.<eos> Victim's name is Abby Smith.<eos> She's 23 years old.<eos> A maintenance worker found her early this morning.<eos> We're dealing with something messed up here.<eos> You got that right, starting off with these stab wounds.<eos> They're round.
It's...<eos> Is your mother a fool?<eos> No. Someone is being mean to my boy!<eos> Hey. It's a tough business.<eos> The restaurant business is so tough these days?<eos> Why is that?<eos> My success makes other people envious.<eos> So tell the boss on these people.<eos> This person isn't scared of the boss.<eos> Not like they should be.
Because every time they do, it might be the last time.<eos> Every Christmas is last Christmas.<eos> And this is ours.<eos> This was a bonus.<eos> This is extra.<eos> But now it's time to wake up.<eos> Clara?<eos> Clara, Clara, look at me.<eos> Clara, Clara, breathe! Breathe, breathe, breathe.<eos> So these creatures, when their feeding goes wrong, they die.
Did you see the nose?<eos> The North Pole?<eos> Come on, with stripes?<eos> - This... - ...is a dream.<eos> How much more obvious do you want me to make it?<eos> Because I can text the Easter Bunny, you know.<eos> Seriously?<eos> You're trying to help?<eos> As you stand here, chatting, chatting, your lives are ending.<eos> Unless you wake up, unless you free yourselves from these dreadful creatures, they're gonna destroy you.
You had a nice moment on the road with a stranger, but that's all he was, a stranger.<eos> A stranger.<eos> Two people passing in the night.<eos> Are you ok?<eos> Mm-hmm. Yeah.<eos> Let's just... Let's just keep going.<eos> Ugh. How many more streets are we gonna wander?<eos> How many times are you gonna ask me questions I don't have the answers to?<eos> There's something weird about these cars.<eos> Yeah, they're almost all 20 years old or more, and yet they look brand-new.
So, the man you're looking for, you said he's pushing fake dog tags?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Todd Price.<eos> You know him?<eos> No.<eos> Just this market?<eos> They're everywhere.<eos> Tourists feel compelled to buy them, return them to the next of kin.<eos> Most times, the tags belong to a vet who survived the war, just got lost somewhere along the way.<eos> Or they're fake.
Or they're fake.<eos> Yes.<eos> Cam on.<eos> When Saigon fell at the end of the war, the U.S. pulled out fast.<eos> Left a lot behind, including graphotype machines.<eos> People get their hands on them, use them to make fakes.<eos> Price has specific targets.<eos> He's got to be making his own tags.<eos> Can we trace the machines?<eos> Ah, they've had almost 40 years to change hands.
You sure she can be trusted?<eos> - I could say the same thing about you.<eos> - Ladies, please.<eos> I'm surprised the two of you haven't met at a conference or company retreat.<eos> Does the FBI do a Christmas party?<eos> One of the priests sent to guard the strain got sick.<eos> And to protect it, the dying man swallowed it whole, taking it to his grave.<eos> We know this because the others survived and created the map.<eos> And the markings?<eos> What do they mean?
Stay back, you monster!<eos> Ah!<eos> Yes, yes, get him, Goldie, get him.<eos> I'm gonna eat your face like pizza.<eos> I've got you surrounded, Soos.<eos> There is no way out.<eos> Please, let my friends go.<eos> I'll do anything you want. I promise.<eos> I seem to remember someone promising he'll be my boyfriend.<eos> Think about it, real girls are unpredictable, they judge you.
You, your men, and that intolerable Nathan Wuornos.<eos> Her beams could have killed you.<eos> Her beams are narrow.<eos> If you feel the heat, just move a bit.<eos> But the microwaves...<eos> Those were inspired.<eos> Even in their failure, they were fun.<eos> Nothing about you is fun.<eos> Believe what you want about my mission, Dwight, but the troubles...<eos> They're incredibly entertaining.

He was a good guy, great cop.<eos> But you keep something like that to yourself?<eos> I always try to keep my emotions in check.<eos> I already told the other detective.<eos> I was in my office in the back when I heard some horns honking, then yelling.<eos> I went out to see what was going on, and I saw the man standing over the delivery guy with the tire iron.<eos> But you didn't see a single blow thrown, huh?<eos> No, it was over.<eos> How about the video cameras?<eos> They catch anything?
What did we say about half-naked Snapchats?<eos> We didn't say anything.<eos> You said, "this is a place of business,"<eos> and then you asked what Snapchat was, and I had to tell you because, as usual, you have no idea what anything fun is.<eos> Once again, Freddy is reinforcing your bad habits and, quite frankly,<eos> - stoking some of his own.<eos> - What?<eos> If you two put a fraction of your narcissistic energy into solving the issues currently plaguing our society, perhaps rising sea levels, autism, and the rabidly dwindling bee population would be things of the past.<eos> Whoa. Somebody needs to get laid.<eos> Sometimes I say things that are totally true without even realizing how true they are, like in 2008 when I accidentally said...
Because what we are doing is unsavory<eos> - and we're hiding from God.<eos> - And you also... you promised Winston and everybody pizza, so...<eos> Yeah, you definitely did.<eos> - Yes, there'll be pizza.<eos> - Just do one thing for me first.<eos> Here, memorize these.<eos> That's yours.<eos> That's yours.<eos> "I love sponges because they connect my heart to my hand."
- I'm gonna k... kill you!<eos> - I just thought maybe we'd talk about toppings, perhaps, or something.<eos> Not a mirror.<eos> Not a mirror, you idiot.<eos> Not a mirror.<eos> Sponges make me feel exhilarated more than any...<eos> Did you just say "sponges make me feel exhilarated"?<eos> No, no.<eos> I... I.. What do you think of sponges?<eos> - They're stupid.
Look, Dad, I'm so sorry.<eos> - Is there anything I can do...<eos> - There's nothing more that you can do.<eos> I... I knew this was a mistake bringing her here.<eos> Wait, Dad.<eos> So, uh, why don't you tell me what you think about that sponge there, Coach.<eos> I mean...<eos> Ernie.<eos> I don't know why I would call you Coach.<eos> - Um... Well, I love sponges because they connect my heart to my hand.
Aren't you?<eos> Of course I am.<eos> It's one of the most prestigious tech schools in the country.<eos> But if you must know,<eos> I don't love everything about it.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, the mascot's a beaver.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Those jokes will get old.<eos> No, they won't, because I'm not coming here.
You know what I'm gonna miss most?<eos> Pancakes.<eos> I keep having dreams of Aunt Jemima.<eos> She's trying to tell me something. But then she just fades away.<eos> We can't do this alone.<eos> You have to get up.<eos> you guys.<eos> The world is upside down.<eos> Things aren't gonna get better.<eos> They're gonna get worse.
You have such contempt for what you don't know.<eos> Is that what you plan to do to Laurie and Annie?<eos> Why did you have the pictures in your house?<eos> I want to help them.<eos> By cutting them up?<eos> Those girls are in danger.<eos> I've lived in that house.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Know what?<eos> They need my help.
I heard a noise, so I went out onto the landing, and there it was.<eos> There what was?<eos> A specter.<eos> A ghost, a phantom, whatever you want to call it.<eos> The thing reached out for me, and all reason and logic went out the window.<eos> I was terrified.<eos> I knew, whatever it was, it was evil.<eos> And that's when you decided it had to be stopped.<eos> Someone needs to help these girls.<eos> They need to be protected.
You don't love somebody by scaring them, breaking into their house, ruining their lives.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> If you're really sorry, you'll leave me alone for good, and if you don't, I will use every resource in my power to have you locked up.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> No happy ending.<eos> He crossed a line, Jack.<eos> Can't he cross back?<eos> You don't believe in second chances?<eos> I think they need to be earned.
Oh. No.<eos> Did you think that I was foolish enough to bring it with me?<eos> The hat is hidden far away.<eos> And unless he gives me what I want, the sorcerer will never see his hat again.<eos> And what is it that you so desire?<eos> Happiness.<eos> The kind I haven't known in a long time... since I was a little girl, running in a field with my sisters, chasing a kite.<eos> Our love made us strong.<eos> Until it didn't.<eos> My sisters could never accept who I was because they were... ordinary.
Rumplestiltskin.<eos> - Rumplest...<eos> - Stop!<eos> I have traveled far to find you.<eos> Why are you conjuring the dark one when you have a deal with the sorcerer?<eos> Do you doubt he can find the sister you seek?<eos> No.<eos> But I lost the one that I already had.<eos> You told me you were a patient woman.<eos> Happy endings can take a long time, but they do happen.
Well, it's about to get crazier.<eos> Duke's about to give a press conference.<eos> Apparently someone sent a link of his stubbl account to TMZ.<eos> I thought someone was done outing people.<eos> I was.<eos> But hasn't Theo being a narc taught us you can only hide who you are for so long?<eos> Now, let's see him try to lie his way out of this one.<eos> Thank you, everyone, for being here today.<eos> I'd like to address the recent rumors that have been going around about my sexuality.<eos> They're true.
Please, do.<eos> Because a few more calls and I'll be able to arrest you for impeding a murder investigation.<eos> He looks pissed,<eos> Agent Booth.<eos> Yeah, he does.<eos> I'll tell you what, I'll let you get back to work.<eos> I'm sure you've got some more polluting to do.<eos> Hey.<eos> So, I think you're right.<eos> The-the links between the people blackmailed and the positions they occupied created more compromised individuals who could then be blackmailed, who then blackmailed other people...
New deputy chief of SVU.<eos> Yeah, citywide, and he wants to do a full press conference on this perp.<eos> Of course he does.<eos> So guess he's decided that it's only one guy?<eos> He has, and I told him that that was our job, and we're still deciding whether or not to make that call.<eos> So any DNA yet?<eos> In both attacks, the perp failed to launch.<eos> And from a victimology perspective, they're both in their early 20s, blonde, they're attractive, and he called them both by name, knew personal details from their past.<eos> He also counted out the stabs.<eos> Melinda said the wounds were consistent enough that they could have come from the same knife.
That's what he meant.<eos> How old were you, 15?<eos> Is that why he stabbed me 15 times?<eos> You said his name is Holden?<eos> He worked at Catignano?<eos> Mostly in the kitchen.<eos> It could be the guy who came at me.<eos> I don't remember him at all.<eos> Hey. So this guy is a boo radley.<eos> We had to show the girls childhood pictures before they could even start to place him.

So this guy is a boo radley.<eos> We had to show the girls childhood pictures before they could even start to place him.<eos> But he remembers every slight from grade school on.<eos> He's an accumulator, an injustice collector.<eos> Back up.<eos> Did they I.D. Him?
I need a minute, please.<eos> Miss Jackson, yes. So sorry.<eos> That's not what you should be sorry about.<eos> I'm in the hospital where your foster child is in a step-down unit with a babysitter.<eos> I was there all night, and Mrs. Amaro is not a sitter.<eos> She's actually a family friend.<eos> And I just spoke to Noah's doctor.<eos> So did I.<eos> She called me after finding the child's fractured ribs.<eos> Yes. Then you know that those injuries happened before I took custody of Noah, and that they've healed now.
He's got four of them as hostages.<eos> All your team should be working toward right now is move him into a position from which we can take him out.<eos> Look at him.<eos> Helpless, useless.<eos> You think he's better than me.<eos> I don't.<eos> He's not.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> I'm not a kid.<eos> These young girls, they don't get it.

Anonymous emails, payments by one-time wire transfer.<eos> It's better for everyone if we don't use names.<eos> But I'm gonna find the bastard behind this.<eos> I'm gonna steal those vials back, and I'm gonna make him pay.<eos> You in?<eos> What do you think?<eos> I have a friend who can make those anonymous emails way less anonymous.<eos> So this is where the magic happens.<eos> Rented 10,000 square feet of office space and filled it with state-of-the-art 3-D printers.<eos> Almost all the 12 million went to paying for these, but once they're up and running, we'll be making all the tablets right here in New York.
We both eventually wind up dead.<eos> Are you sure you won't stay?<eos> Ms. Shaw and Mr. Koroa are leaving, John.<eos> And considering that the police are en route, now might be a good time for you to make your exit too.<eos> Freeze.<eos> Go.<eos> Go!<eos> _<eos> I got a call about a fire on the second floor.<eos> Suite 205, the 3-D printers, are they okay?
Who knew that matching like-colored candy Was worth millions of dollars?<eos> Really makes college seem like a sound investment.<eos> - All right, guys, I'd love to catch up, But we really need to figure out what's going on here.<eos> - Yes, right.<eos> Nathan, he's a ghost.<eos> - Not necessarily a ghost, he's just--<eos> - Ghost, incorporeal, doesn't matter.<eos> Let me tell you something.<eos> A lot of the strange things that happen around here, People dismiss it as paranormal activity.<eos> But just because these things are caused by the troubles, Doesn't mean they're not bound by physical laws.
Mrs. Wagner, there's nothing you can do for him now.<eos> I just want to see him one more time.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> What about the shooters?<eos> Three women, early 20's-- a redhead, brunette and a blonde.<eos> They were all wearing bikinis, backpacks, sunglasses and hats.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> That, uh, really narrows it down.<eos> All right.<eos> So, as soon as they got off the bus, they blended right into the crowd.

Probably wouldn't hurt to compile a list of the passengers' cell phones. Might be able to lock onto a GPS signal.<eos> That's good.<eos> On it.<eos> What about the wife?<eos> She give you anything?<eos> Yeah. Good look at the shooter after her sunglasses came off in the struggle.<eos> After she's released from the hospital, I'll put her in front of some photos.<eos> All right.<eos> So our Vic puts up a fight, and ends up in the morgue.<eos> I'm sure these girls weren't expecting resistance, but it's clear they're not gonna hesitate to pull the trigger.
Hey, I'm trying to protect you, all right?<eos> Just 'cause you want to believe something doesn't make it true.<eos> I understand.<eos> Have a wonderful afternoon...<eos> You're joking.<eos> Hey, don't look at me-- this is McGarrett's idea.<eos> Huh?<eos> I'm not wearing this.<eos> These girls are surfers;<eos> we know where they hang out.

What?<eos> ! Well, that doesn't seem like a very savvy way to secure valuable information, especially for a tech guy.<eos> Yeah, but this wasn't just any phone-- it was equipped with a state-of-the-art firewall that made it resistant to hacking.<eos> The only way in was his thumbprint.<eos> Vanessa Hansen was gonna use those codes to drain millions from the bank.<eos> Well, that would explain why Wagner put up a fight.<eos> Mmm.<eos> So she said she followed him from the hotel to the bus put a gun in his side, said "We're gonna get off in a few stops," where there was a car waiting with a laptop inside<eos> to do a wire transfer to an offshore account.<eos> Those girls had no idea what they were walking into when they got onto that bus.

to do a wire transfer to an offshore account.<eos> Those girls had no idea what they were walking into when they got onto that bus.<eos> For them, life as they knew it was simple.<eos> It was waking up every day with a desire to catch a better wave than the day before.<eos> The adrenaline you feel paddling out knowing that at any time you could get the ride of your life.<eos> And then there's the rush of walking on water.<eos> Only gods do that.<eos> Everything they did was to preserve that life.<eos> To surf is to get up every day with a desire to battle something greater than yourself.<eos> And those girls just wanted to ride that wave as long as they could.
Bye. Be safe.<eos> Hey, Ryan, how's it going?<eos> Oh, wonderful. In fact, we were just discussing your nuptials.<eos> Not the actual event, since neither of us were there.<eos> Guys, is this really why you're calling?<eos> Partly, yes.<eos> And we have news.<eos> Here's the good.<eos> MTA cameras show that Whitney's bags were left on the subway.<eos> Here's the bad news... they were stolen by a homeless man.
Well, yeah.<eos> Well, I'd probably be surprised...<eos> Hey, Simmons.<eos> The explosives...<eos> Mack was just...<eos> he saw the, um...<eos> Yeah, he kept mentioning backlogged files, and, you know, half the stuff he says is nonsense.<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> - Check this out.<eos> It turns out these bombs are actually from the 1940s, and they were developed by a HYDRA scientist
Latin lover narrator: Uh-oh. I'm s... uh, J...<eos> Jane the Virgin?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Jane the Virgin?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Well... It's, um...<eos> It's a web site.<eos> Do you remember Rogelio's stepdaughters?<eos> Yeah.<eos> They started it to be making fun of me.
You want power.<eos> You want revenge.<eos> But how could I possibly help you?<eos> I'm irrelevant.<eos> Lady Kenna?<eos> - Have we met?<eos> - In the tent city.<eos> Noble wives bragging about their summer homes at your expense.<eos> They are preening pea hens with empty heads.<eos> Are they not your friends?
- They'll take down the base's feed.<eos> - Man with the plan.<eos> Once per quarter, General Cole inspects Kaena point.<eos> This time, he'll meet the new relay commander.<eos> Let me guess...<eos> commander's name is Darren.<eos> That's right.<eos> And since he's new, introductions will be made.<eos> On their own, these two pieces are harmless, undetectable to security.<eos> But as they near each other, they'll power up an E.M.P., and boom... kiss your Wi-Fi, your coffee maker, and your top-secret satellite feed goodbye.
Bobbly-heads!<eos> They agree with everything I say.<eos> Professor glasses!<eos> They make me look like a genius.<eos> Look at these faux-gold beauties.<eos> They're mob-boss quality.<eos> All right, kids, prepare to watch the delicate art of the deal.<eos> Hey, hag-face!<eos> How much for the junk watches?<eos> They are not for sale.
But how are these things real?<eos> - What about stop motion?<eos> - What?<eos> Do you really believe someone moves these figures one frame at a time?<eos> I'm not a masochist.<eos> I used black magic to make them animate themselves.<eos> It was great at first, but one day...<eos> No!<eos> Where's the heart? !<eos> Now that they were out of work, they went mad and enslaved me!

Your Honor, please ask the defense<eos> - to restrain itself.<eos> - Restrain yourself, ma'am.<eos> Ms. Vargas, have you thrown your cell phone<eos> - at your assistants?<eos> - Objection, Your Honor.<eos> Goes to management skills.<eos> Yes. Overruled.<eos> You may answer, ma'am.<eos> Look, women are called bitches when they have a tough management style.
How much meat?<eos> ! Then we take a fart nap.<eos> - Not for me.<eos> Pass. - All right, guys, - it's Guys' Night.<eos> Let's think. - Okay.<eos> Anything else we can't do when Jess is here.<eos> Wow. - Look at that stretching.<eos> - I don't want to... make this sound too creepy, but I want to own those girls.<eos> I wouldn't touch them.<eos> They'd want for nothing.

- Okay.<eos> Bye! - Bye!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> What just happened?<eos> That's a girl fight.<eos> Schmidt, stay out of it, man.<eos> Girl fights are dangerous, okay?<eos> I grew up with three sisters, and I wore a cup until I was 14 years old.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> They planned to wear braids and bows and didn't tell me on purpose.
And for the record, chief, the student's R.A. called us, because everybody knows that campus security pressures girls into dropping charges.<eos> It seems that Hudson University is more concerned with their Clery Act stats than they are with rape.<eos> Ah, so it's true.<eos> The word upstairs is you have an agenda.<eos> It colors your perception.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> This is not the case to embarrass Hudson or the department with.<eos> Pick your battles.<eos> I didn't know anyone would see those other videos.<eos> My producer said they were behind a paywall.
Interesting, but not enough for a warrant, so we'll circle back.<eos> See you at the garage.<eos> Where's Walter going?<eos> Um...<eos> Walter, is your mind on the homicide, or is this the same agitation from earlier?<eos> Oh, I think you've overshot your analysis of me for today.<eos> You are hunting big adrenaline game because of your high intelligence.<eos> You will keep stalking bigger thrills unless you deal with your issues.<eos> High-risk activities aren't an emotional distraction.<eos> They are relaxing.
But why?<eos> What if it's trying to reach out to the machine the only way it knows how.<eos> But then why do it this way?<eos> Why not just-- I don't know.<eos> How do artificial super intelligences usually talk to each other?<eos> These machines have avoided making contact with one another for good reason.<eos> If two dueling ASIs arrive at anything short of consensus, the outcome could be catastrophic.<eos> Two angry gods hurling boulders at one another while the ants scurry below.<eos> This may be a request for peace talks.<eos> Well, maybe they should just kiss and make up.
- Sorry.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - Capp!<eos> - Set!<eos> All right, Casey, cribbing's set.<eos> Let's get this thing lifted.<eos> Herrmann!<eos> Where are my jacks?<eos> Jack handles are missing!<eos> Not where they're supposed to...
What is he doing?<eos> He's putting socks in a soda box and pulling them out.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> This is like when my grandmother started combing her hair with a cactus.<eos> Jay, Jay, who is the president?<eos> I will be when they see this.<eos> Check this out.<eos> What's my biggest problem in the bedroom?<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> It's that I'm always wearing the same socks because they're always up front.
It's all the rage with guys like me.<eos> Hackers like you.<eos> Investigative computer specialists.<eos> Too legit to quit.<eos> Okay, MC Hammer, how do you get a biotracker into someone?<eos> Well, as you can see, they're very tiny.<eos> Normally, they're hidden in a pill.<eos> Any chance he could have swallowed it himself?<eos> Not unless he's a crazy-ass.<eos> Those things are not tested; they're dangerous.
Agent Pride, do you think they were killed because of Darby's work here?<eos> We're exploring all possibilities.<eos> You'd be right to be concerned.<eos> My employees have had issues in the past.<eos> Routine attempts at hacking into our system, extortion, espionage...<eos> Terrorist organizations?<eos> From al-Qaeda to the Red Hacker Alliance out of Beijing.<eos> Our employees have targets on their backs-- that's why we do everything in our power to keep them safe.<eos> But the truth is, the technologies we develop are the cutting edge.<eos> They're worth killing for-- a fact we're, admittedly, quite proud of.
Sometimes sentimentality pays off.<eos> Point Elsa.<eos> There's...<eos> Mirror dust in this.<eos> Actually embedded in the metal.<eos> So I was right.<eos> She was under that spell.<eos> So if we find Anna, she can save everyone.<eos> I'll round up the fairies.<eos> They can set up shop somewhere close and figure out how to make the counterspell.
Mitchell, focus on the goal.<eos> You know she only dresses the way she does to get attention.<eos> Maybe it was cute a few years ago, but she's just getting too old for this.<eos> You know what she needs is a good spank on the bottom.<eos> No, that's your father's way.<eos> You told them about that?<eos> I'm telling you, if I had this closet, I never would have come out.<eos> Well, you can come back later.<eos> Let's just get this over with.<eos> If those mean girls have something to say to me, they should say it to my face.
What... what are you doing?<eos> I'm wiping it down like you told me.<eos> It's not polish, Dawson.<eos> It's wax.<eos> You got to let it dry to a haze first.<eos> Then you buff it out.<eos> Right.<eos> You can move to another section while you wait.<eos> Then I'm gonna talk you through the rims.<eos> They got to shine like the day they were made.
You mean recently or ten years ago?<eos> Do you recognize this family?<eos> I'll take that as a no.<eos> Um... how about now?<eos> Oh, these are good.<eos> How about these?<eos> The Fishers went on a camping trip and someone slaughtered them in their tent.<eos> Wasn't me.<eos> The girls were five and nine.<eos> They're really cute, really innocent.
If anyone can help me, you can.<eos> Please.<eos> Save me from Lord Narcisse.<eos> It'll be a beautiful ceremony for Lola's child.<eos> So much better, now that Mary's carrying a baby of her own.<eos> There he is.<eos> Greer, tell me the truth.<eos> Is there any version of this life where you and Leith could be together?<eos> My sisters need me to make a good marriage, their own prospects depend on it.<eos> What if they were as clever and resourceful as you?

Which makes it easy for clever people like this to take advantage.<eos> It is a masterful exploitation of a weakness.<eos> He wants you to join him for tea?<eos> Surely that can't mean "tea."<eos> No. Perhaps he wants to try and pry secrets from me about Francis.<eos> Or he might simply want to seduce you.<eos> Either way, it's better to stay far away from him.<eos> After all, last time we talked, you thought he'd murdered his wives.<eos> I was wrong...<eos> I learned they died of natural causes.
What...<eos> Mmm, I am an experienced actor, you know.<eos> Mmm, you should've heard the applause when I played Guinevere.<eos> But I thought women weren't allowed on the stage.<eos> Well, we aren't, and that's why I couldn't make a living.<eos> But then I found a lover, and he found me this touring work, and it's been easy ever since.<eos> People just give us their best food and wine, and ask nothing in return.<eos> I love being a queen.<eos> What are you telling these people?<eos> It's all right, they're like us.

If you are not here by five o'clock we will kill your wife.<eos> This is our moment!<eos> We've been chosen!<eos> I'm a Town Planning and Noise Guidance Advisor for Berkshire County Council!<eos> "Small town, big future."<eos> You're a 31-year-old Mail Distribution Assistant who lives with his mum!<eos> What did I tell you about watching mucky ladies?<eos> They're not happy.
- Guess this is where we part ways.<eos> - It's been a blast!<eos> - We're heading north too.<eos> Why don't you come with us?<eos> It's the least we can do after you saved our necks.<eos> - On that hunk of junk?<eos> No thanks. I'm allergic to drowning.<eos> Oof! I mean, uh, we'd love a lift!<eos> - This area is overrun with spirit vines<eos> And they appear to be even more powerful Than the samples we took from republic city.
I'm ready!<eos> - Be with you in one second!<eos> Kind of busy!<eos> - Okay!<eos> Ready now! - One. Two.<eos> Nothing's happening.<eos> - Kuvira must have done some override thing and taken control!<eos> - There's got to be some other way to shut down power from here.<eos> You spent all that time working with varrick and baatar Jr. Didn't any of their genius rub off on you?<eos> - Look, the only thing I know about these vines is that if you mess around with them too much, they explode.
What about Bonnie?<eos> She sacrificed herself so I can come back.<eos> I don't want anyone to know.<eos> There's no sense making this harder than it already is.<eos> What are we gonna tell people?<eos> He said that she wasn't over there.<eos> Where is there, exactly?<eos> - Mystic Falls, 1994?<eos> - I know.<eos> A bunch of witches were gonna get together and create some space-time purgatory, you'd think they'd pick a better year than the one that Kurt Cobain killed himself.
Look, I want our wedding to be perfect too, but...<eos> Great!<eos> So we're on the same page.<eos> Let's go down there.<eos> Yo, dude.<eos> You wanna play with us?<eos> We need a fourth.<eos> Oh, sorry, guys.<eos> I'm waiting on my lady friends.<eos> They're two hours late.
she's growing up, changing so fast.<eos> Just trying to hold on to every second.<eos> Hey, what kind of dad do you think I'd be?<eos> You'd be great.<eos> Even growing up with no role model?<eos> Well, you know, the thing of it is, is that you know what it's like not having a father.<eos> You'd make sure your kid never felt that way.<eos> You and Lanie... Hmm?<eos> No.<eos> She likes things how they are.
Seems unlikely.<eos> To even think about a deal in this situation,<eos> Mr. George needs to tell us what happened.<eos> Bill, I promised that I would help you, and I'm doing that.<eos> But you have to help me and Sharon out a little, too, okay?<eos> So look.<eos> Now that you've had some time to think...<eos> I don't know the girl.<eos> I told you I don't know her.<eos> Bill, I've been doing this a long time, and I'm aware that things aren't always what they seem.
It's makeup for camera.<eos> Wow, Frank. A bit of a sweet tooth?<eos> No.<eos> Do you like cookies?<eos> You have to have some. Please.<eos> Uh, two tins.<eos> Three tins, at least.<eos> I'm all right. Thank you, though.<eos> Oh, it's the ladies online.<eos> They have a-a fan club.

The Finch flew away when he came out of the woods.<eos> Okay, can you... can you tell me about him?<eos> - Not the bird, the man.<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> He was huge, hulking, hunched over the girl's body like a turkey vulture.<eos> I yelled for him to shoo, and he took off into the woods.<eos> Do you think you could give his description to a sketch artist?<eos> I can do better than that.<eos> I took photographs.<eos> They're digital.
Did you call Perry's parents?<eos> No. She's a single mom.<eos> We called. We texted. We went over there- 291 Dyckman...<eos> - Okay. - No one answered the door, but our tracker app says the girls' phones are inside.<eos> Okay, look, I need you to try and stay calm.<eos> Please have a seat. Have a seat.<eos> I need for you to look through your phones.<eos> Find the most recent photos of Mia and Zoe that you can,<eos> Okay, now one girl stabbed, now two others missing or worse.<eos> They're not responding from inside that apartment.
Is that why you drew her here covered in blood with Perry and Mia?<eos> Look, Perry likes scary stories.<eos> I started to turn them into a graphic novel,<eos> - but it's all fiction.<eos> - Yeah, fiction.<eos> So what's the plot?<eos> What happens to the girls?<eos> There's, like, six books.<eos> I just started editing it all this weekend.<eos> I don't know where they are.

She said she was attacked last night, but there was no inflammation, no bruising.<eos> These injuries are fresh.<eos> I'd say an hour old, two at the most.<eos> And, doctor, any defensive wounds?<eos> No.<eos> None, actually.<eos> - It just doesn't add up.<eos> - Hey, how did it go with the girls?<eos> The timeline is way off.<eos> They're both blaming Charlie.

- Who?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Maybe it's a "Romeo and Juliet" kind of thing?<eos> Two girls go off to be with some Svengali...<eos> Right. Well, then who stabbed Zoe?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Rollins, did you check the girls' social media?<eos> Yeah, in their texts, their emails, there's no boyfriends, not even really any other friends.<eos> It's just a lot of back and forth between Perry and Mia.<eos> They're in their own world.

DNA from Zoe on the blade of the knife found in Charlie's camp.<eos> Ah, this is interesting... on the handle, touch DNA from Charlie and guess who else.<eos> Perry and Mia.<eos> So Charlie was telling the truth.<eos> He picked up that knife same as he did the camera.<eos> Go give him the good news.<eos> Bring those girls back in here and tell their mothers why.<eos> Should we call Barbara too?<eos> Both of the girls are under 14 years old.<eos> Zoe lived. They can't be tried as adults.
Use your heads.<eos> Think back to what it was like before the spell changed you.<eos> Sure, you had issues with each other, but they were minor.<eos> Minor? Minor?<eos> When I first met her, she hit me in the face.<eos> If that wasn't a sign, I don't know what is.<eos> Yes, you responded by hanging me in a net from a tree.<eos> You're a real prince charming.<eos> Yes, he is Prince Charming, and you're Snow White.<eos> And those things sound terrible but they also sound romantic.
~ And there's the proof.<eos> Seems like a happy kid.<eos> How's life?<eos> You seeing anyone?<eos> Not really. Er...<eos> I went for a drink with someone who seems great. Maybe that's a thing.<eos> But I did sort of er fall for someone... but she's getting married.<eos> Evie's getting married?<eos> Are you going to say something?<eos> Sort of let things drift and hope they sort themselves out?
Erm, the Trans-M Conference is held once a year in Leeds and two years ago, the dates were the 18th to the 21st of May, and the delegate ticket price was £240.<eos> ~ We didn't go. ~ It's a gift!<eos> Because we were in France, in Lyon, which is 290 miles from Paris... ~ Maybe enough now, Samuels.<eos> ~ Yeah, yeah. He certainly looked a lot like you.<eos> It wasn't me!<eos> ~ Well, this is awkward.<eos> ~ You told the girls that I...<eos> I might also have added a few details that made it sound worse.<eos> ~ But in my defence, I was wrong.<eos> ~ They hate me!
- What are you doing here, Steven?<eos> What?<eos> I ... no!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> This thing, the ocean, this is crazy.<eos> Can't we work this out?<eos> We gems should be friends.<eos> - Whoa!<eos> - Don't you know anything, Steven?<eos> Your friends, they don't really care about other gems.
About that.<eos> Hm?<eos> While you're getting that psych hold,<eos> Loretta has some news.<eos> Don't think Abbott was your killer.<eos> He confessed.<eos> Science doesn't care about the lies men tell.<eos> Sebastian said the ballistics matched.<eos> They do. And Rodney's fingerprints are on the shell casings.<eos> They are. But...?
Think about all those battered women Who would hear your story and they'd get a little hope.<eos> Think of all the lives you could change.<eos> You'd be a hero to so many women.<eos> Right?<eos> I did that.<eos> We did that for clients for years.<eos> They came, we fixed, and we conquered.<eos> But what happened to those women, liv?<eos> They became anita hill, monica lewinsky.<eos> They stood up, liv.

I'm back.<eos> That's what you wanted, right?<eos> That's what you screamed at me about?<eos> How you hated drunk mellie and crybaby mellie<eos> And there was one about food.<eos> I don't know what you called it.<eos> I like to think of it as chicken-fried mellie.<eos> You wanted those mellies gone, right?<eos> So...<eos> They're gone.
Half that money you're wasting is mine!<eos> I waste money?<eos> I paid half for you and Kip to go see Olivia Newton John in concert.<eos> Wasn't just Olivia.<eos> It was Olivia, Cher and Madonna.<eos> All done by one amazing young man.<eos> Okay, can we agree it's time you two split up your finances and officially file for divorce?<eos> Or not!<eos> Maybe, uh...<eos> Maybe things are fine the way they are.

What's ymer?<eos> Sour milk.<eos> The point is, you should be prepared to eat your ymer like a native.<eos> Oh? How's that?<eos> - On kammerjunker, obviously.<eos> - Obviously.<eos> Look, just forget about the ymer.<eos> You're the one who keeps bringing it up the ymer.<eos> What we're here for, my good man, - are the Chinese pork dumplings. - I can't...<eos> They're pretty much the best in the world.
Grohl: Did you ever listen to the blues?<eos> Were you a blues person?<eos> Um, a little bit.<eos> I like Delta blues.<eos> I don't really care for northern blues, like Chicago blues.<eos> I don't like "perky" blues.<eos> If you have to suffer to sing the blues, um,<eos> I don't think you necessarily have to suffer to be punk rock, but it helps.<eos> I don't think you have to be angry, but it probably helps.<eos> Houston and Dallas had their little scenes, but they weren't so good.
All this fighting is making me so damn hot.<eos> Oh, my God. It looks like he's chalking a pool cue.<eos> Hey, scoot over.<eos> As the oldest guy here, it's my duty to take an open mouth nap in the middle of the room.<eos> God, look at my mom.<eos> Dinner should've been served half an hour ago.<eos> She's clearly stalling for time.<eos> Okay, everybody. Dinner's gonna be ready very soon.<eos> Uh, what?<eos> Um, oh, good. But before we get started, I thought we could all take turns telling a long story about how things aren't the way they used to be.
Can you take a look at these for me and tell me if you recognize them?<eos> He was killed while wearing her.<eos> Yeah, she's my work.<eos> Right. Okay.<eos> And... what about Mr. Kern there?<eos> What can you tell me about him?<eos> Nothing.<eos> The men who come here, they're not big on names.<eos> They-they pay with cash.<eos> And-and when my creations walk out this door, they take on a life of their own.
And the vehicle is registered to this guy.<eos> I met him at the club.<eos> He's one of their admirers.<eos> Let's bring him in.<eos> Hi, Adrian. I'm CSI Finlay.<eos> I, uh, would like to talk to you about Charlene.<eos> We know she was in your vehicle.<eos> We found carpet fibers that are consistent with the interior of an Escalade on her doll suit.<eos> You know what it is I love about the dolls at that club?<eos> How little they speak.

No, I have to make some changes.<eos> Starting now.<eos> But... but not right now.<eos> You go for a jog right this second, I don't think you'd ever be able to walk again.<eos> I did mention not wanting to be punched, didn't I?<eos> Yeah, uh, but it's good cardio.<eos> Oh, like that really hurt.<eos> That hurt?<eos> The ABCs of trauma are a handy tool for keeping a patient alive.<eos> But they're only a starting point.
It's inoperable.<eos> I thought I had longer, but it's growing.<eos> Soon, I will show symptoms, and after that, I will die.<eos> Who knows about this?<eos> Hunt?<eos> Uh, anyone?<eos> Fetal surgery is a new field.<eos> The few of us who are practicing it are basically inventing it as we go along.<eos> The things I know, the things I scribble down in the margins, no one has them.<eos> They're not in any textbook.
Lands?<eos> I have vast holdings, and I am well...<eos> Endowed?<eos> Provided for... through my family and my own enterprises.<eos> Well, I haven't seen your... region... but I assume it's satisfying.<eos> That is the popular view.<eos> Of your many lovers, that's right.<eos> I hear you are quite the ruiner of noble married women.<eos> That is slander.<eos> They returned to their husbands in... finer spirits than when they went on holiday.
Tell me we didn't fund an assassination on our king.<eos> Still no word from Balfont?<eos> None yet, my lord.<eos> - And where is the king?<eos> - At a secure location, the guards are saying.<eos> They must have moved him the second the alarms sounded.<eos> They say it was Protestants wearing stolen uniforms of the guards.<eos> Well, it seems they killed anyone who saw them as they moved through the castle.<eos> Well, at least the engagement will surely be off.<eos> Things can remain... as they were.
Because I'm paying attention.<eos> This is what I need from you, Kalinda.<eos> I need you to find out what your girlfriend is working on.<eos> If you want me to feel calm about you sleeping with a federal agent, find out what case she is on.<eos> You understand?<eos> Good.<eos> Now get out.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Where are your chairs?<eos> Oh, they, um... they arrive tomorrow.
Might be a little cold at first.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Where do you store that thing?<eos> Inside the Snow Queen?<eos> Uh, let's see if we can enhance the image.<eos> Congratulations, you're pregnant.<eos> Congratulations, you are under arrest.<eos> I am assuming there will be no charge.<eos> I have dedicated my entire career to helping women get pregnant.<eos> Or, by helping them think that they are pregnant.
Does nothing seem strange about that tale to you?<eos> All magic has a cost.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> The Sword requires a sacrifice... the life of anybody who wields it.<eos> You're lying.<eos> The moment a man uses the Sword to kill, his soul, and hence, his life will be taken with it.<eos> Enough deceit!<eos> We have an apocalypse to halt.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait!<eos> The runes on the Sword's hilt... they reference Erelim angels, agents of earthly justice.
♪ And I would walk 500 more ♪<eos> My brother wasn't always like this...<eos> All mad at the world and hopeless.<eos> He used to be an idealist.<eos> The dark knight went through a happy Gilmore phase?<eos> Let me tell you a story about Hunter Cole.<eos> When we were kids, he used to wake me up early on weekends to make chocolate chip pancakes.<eos> But the thing about chef Hunter was that he would rather make one giant, perfect pancake than 20 average ones 'cause he always had to do everything bigger and better.<eos> Otherwise, it wasn't worth doing.<eos> My moms were the same way when they remodeled their master bath.
Spend your life trying to prevent disaster, it's hard to give yourself a break.<eos> So, I'm self-prescribing a day of rest.<eos> Got myself a little BB for the night.<eos> First stop, lobster.<eos> Hmm. I know just the place.<eos> If you don't mind some company.<eos> Sure.<eos> So you hate my new socks?<eos> No, I like them.<eos> I'm just saying they don't make good duty socks.
Hank's troubled?<eos> We need to figure this out.<eos> I don't think that the bears have come back because of your dad.<eos> Have you lost anyone else recently?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I was really worried about Hank yesterday though.<eos> He got this flu, the same one that I had.<eos> But he got it much worse than I did.<eos> You were sick?<eos> Did you lips... did they get all blistered?
Why am I talking to you?<eos> Because our goals are aligned, Duke.<eos> Yours and your friends are not.<eos> You just want to get out of jail. And you want to stay out.<eos> The game has changed, Duke.<eos> Your freedom and my freedom are linked.<eos> Another prediction from Mara the psychic.<eos> Or maybe I should just say psycho.<eos> My predictions are not psychic.<eos> They're based on 500 years of watching humans act out of fear.
I got a job for you to do.<eos> Still need more convincing?<eos> Watch this.<eos> Thanks.<eos> That'll be all.<eos> Many companies use a form of ethanol to artificially ripen their crops.<eos> The average human body produces three CCs a day, so...<eos> Maybe she's secreting it.<eos> Troubles are real.<eos> Except they're not.
Get your flu shot, David.<eos> You know I'm gonna have to investigate this.<eos> So let him investigate.<eos> What will he find?<eos> When I found out Michael worked for Elizabeth North, I deleted all my e-mails and texts, which, in retrospect, doesn't look great.<eos> But it's not illegal.<eos> We're talking about months and months of congressional hearings if we take this on.<eos> Subpoenas.<eos> Special prosecutors.<eos> Until the Counsel's Office gets a bearing on what these photos are and where they came from,
The emulsion has separated from the base.<eos> What does that even mean?<eos> Oh. This must be how it feels to be... well, you.<eos> Kinda feels good being the expert.<eos> - If you wouldn't mind...<eos> - Huh? Illuminating me on the subject of audio recordings...<eos> Happy to help, doc.<eos> Look, you can tell the tape is damaged if you know what you're looking for.<eos> You see these uneven edges?<eos> There's two layers to these old magnetic tapes, and once they come apart, you're left with diddly-squat.
But... they belong to your family.<eos> I can't.<eos> It's too much.<eos> You can't say no.<eos> She left them to you.<eos> She wanted you to have them.<eos> That is so nice of her.<eos> Wait, help me.<eos> Here. Eat the peanuts.<eos> They are so beautiful.
Camera's not working.<eos> Been dysfunctional for a while now.<eos> Listen, I know you claimed a returned.<eos> Your aunt, Heather McCutchen.<eos> Wouldn't you wanna help stop this kind of thing from happening again?<eos> Look, I'd really appreciate it if you just leave.<eos> How come you're gonna look through these old photos anyway?<eos> Old photos are precious.<eos> Ah, careful!<eos> They hold history, forgotten emotions, and memories.
The baby?<eos> So far, you're the only patient to completely recover from the virus.<eos> I think it's due to your pregnancy.<eos> You think the baby cured her somehow?<eos> It's not unheard of.<eos> See, sometimes when a pregnant woman is sick, the fetal stem cells will migrate into her system and help boost her own immune response.<eos> Okay, so what are you asking?<eos> I would like to do an amniocentesis to remove some amniotic fluid.<eos> And if I can isolate the free-floating stem cells,<eos> I can test if they have the ability to cure the virus in others.
♪ CSI 15x11 ♪ Angle of Attack Original Air Date on December 21, 2014<eos> Looks like a tornado went through this place.<eos> This looks like the same glass we found with the victim.<eos> Radial pattern, so... came from that direction.<eos> Two blown-out windows.<eos> It's just like an entrance and an exit wound.<eos> Something blasted in from that window, cut the corner of the room here, and then goes out that one.<eos> Yeah, but what the hell was it?<eos> I mean, this glass is thick.<eos> Normally, you could hit these windows with a baseball bat, they wouldn't even blink.
You should have called for back-up... or improvised<eos> - You've messed up a lot, lately<eos> - What are you saying?<eos> Calm down. It's not Gilou's fault.<eos> We were all there<eos> We all messed up<eos> Any news on the squats?<eos> We have two guys on it.<eos> We'll send photos of the girls to every station<eos> They're skint, they're on the run, they're hardly pros... they shouldn't be that hard to find
Superintendent it's been too long<eos> If you read the newspaper, you'll know how things are going if you're worried about Tarek Ziani, perhaps I can put your mind at rest<eos> Go on<eos> Ziani is under investigation... for trafficking luxury cars between France and Libya<eos> We were led to him by a well-known felon, Djibril Mérini<eos> He steals top-end cars. We've been tailing him for weeks<eos> He supplies Ziani from a garage in the 20th arrondissement<eos> Then he fits the cars with diplomatic number plates<eos> The cars go to Marseille on the 16th<eos> Then they leave for Tripoli
We can negotiate with them We'll do everything we can to find Charlotte<eos> She's asthmatic<eos> If she gets worried or anxious, she'll have an asthma attack<eos> I always put an inhaler in her bag... but what if she's lost it?<eos> The girls will call about the money<eos> So stay here with us We'll help you to talk to them<eos> I could borrow the money from friends<eos> - We're not going to pay them<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Right now, they need Charlotte... but if you pay we don't know what they might do
None of this is real.<eos> - Nuh-unh!<eos> - Yeah-huh.<eos> I told you never to take the headset off outside the access point, didn't I?<eos> We're actually both at my house right now.<eos> You're wearing the headset, and I'm talking to you as a computer program.<eos> That's why I can... manipulate reality.<eos> What? !<eos> You see, in this world,<eos> - things aren't what they seem. - Aah!
You know him?<eos> He's the puzzle master.<eos> His crossword puzzles are syndicated in hundreds of papers.<eos> He's got a book deal.<eos> There's no one better.<eos> Oh, so he wasn't a protester?<eos> Well, no.<eos> He was something of a recluse.<eos> God, I love his puzzles.<eos> I mean, they were impossible.
Which explains why the victim had so many remodeled injuries.<eos> But Brooks' puzzles could stump geniuses.<eos> How could someone with Alzheimer's write them?<eos> Right.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks, Bones.<eos> So I've been looking at Lawrence Brooks fan sites.<eos> There's a lot of chatter about how his puzzles have been different lately.<eos> He might have been stealing more than just Donald's.<eos> They were different because he had Alzheimer's.
You're listed here as a Catholic,<eos> - self-declared.<eos> - I am that.<eos> A believer good and true, I swore it.<eos> Then why are there witnesses, your brethren, who swear they've seen you attending Protestant services?<eos> It's not true; they're lying!<eos> The only liar here is you.<eos> The Bible says, "If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off.<eos> "It is better that you lose one part of your body than that your whole body go into hell."<eos> Since your lips compel you to sin, they should be removed, just as this deceiver's lips were taken, so that your eternal soul may be saved.
I wouldn't be so direct, but...<eos> No, I asked.<eos> Go on.<eos> Princess Claude is...<eos> Well, she's very jealous of the little ones.<eos> She says they paw at her and that they ruin things.<eos> Ruin what, exactly?<eos> My dress.<eos> They pulled the flowers off it.<eos> She says they ruin everything.
(wry laugh) You think that what I do doesn't matter, that the space program is irrelevant.<eos> The fact that my agency is the only one in the entire government currently driving a freaking SUV across the surface of Mars isn't important.<eos> Administrator...<eos> No, no, please... call me Glenn.<eos> Glenn... my earliest memories are of the Apollo missions.<eos> I think NASA plays a vital role in this country.<eos> Thank you.<eos> ELIZABETH: So how can I help you... with time travel?<eos> The Gimbal-Solander telescope is scheduled to be deployed next month.<eos> It's next-gen lenses are so powerful that they will be able to see back in time, to the light that emanated in the... in the milliseconds after the big bang.
Jay, go!<eos> Yeah, okay, yeah, come on, all right, people come on.<eos> Our challenges in the Middle East are great, but our commitment to a shared vision of peace and prosperity in the region needs to be even greater.<eos> Thank you all for coming.<eos> Now eat.<eos> Ambassador Dori.<eos> Ah, Madam Secretary.<eos> Your remarks were very gracious.<eos> Thanks for saying that.<eos> They often feel a little canned.
This way I could get to know you guys a little better.<eos> Yeah, great, yeah, why don't you come on over, and you'll see that we're j-just a normal loving couple. Right, sweetie?<eos> That-that's right, Wally Bear.<eos> I love this guy.<eos> Oh, flowers. Nice touch.<eos> Gives the house a homey feel.<eos> They're for you.<eos> Really?<eos> I'm, uh, actually a lily man.<eos> Uh, but they're very nice.
Two men were murdered this week because someone tried to steal a map from a library that could derail that project.<eos> Now, if you help us identify the perpetrators, you have our word no one will know the information came from you.<eos> You folks got a long drive back to the city.<eos> You ought to get going.<eos> What if I ask a question first?<eos> I came here before my associates and whilst I was walking past your blackjack tables, I couldn't help taking these videos.<eos> You gotta delete those.<eos> It's all in the cloud now.<eos> I noticed how rarely face cards were coming up.<eos> They make up almost a quarter of the deck, but in my videos, I don't see them nearly that often.
Nowhere.<eos> Bonnie's dad is dragging her on a work trip, so I'm gonna ask my parents if she can spend the holiday with us.<eos> Are you serious? Yeah.<eos> The 3 of us have never spent Christmas apart.<eos> I plan on keeping it that way, even though Jeremy will hate it.<eos> It's always fun to torture him. Mm-hmm.<eos> I love you.<eos> Almost as much as I love torturing Jeremy.<eos> Ok, great!<eos> Now that Christmas is saved, let's get these garlands on the tree before they end up on your hips.
I... I didn't hear.<eos> What did she say?<eos> Who say?<eos> The prosecutor, what did she ask?<eos> She said, "are you Cary Agos' lover?"<eos> Old lumberjack.<eos> Asking leading questions and making it appear like the wasted is nothing. The objection is sustained.<eos> Your Honor, we ask that you abstract nunneries.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I ask that you disregard the questions and answers that you just heard.<eos> They have been deemed inadmissible.
No match. But... when I ran the tread through the commercial database, I found these.<eos> They're cheap knockoffs.<eos> Kind of like the sneakers my mom bought for me for my 12th birthday.<eos> See, I had asked for Adidas, right?<eos> But instead, Mom takes a Sharpie to a pair of her nursing shoes.<eos> And it's like, Earth to Mom.<eos> You know, Adidas have three stripes, not four.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> The boots your killer was wearing are the ten-inch desert combat boots, made by that bastion of style, Chinese manufacturer Wee-San.<eos> They retail for about 183 yuan.
Of course.<eos> Thank you, ma'am.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Come on, let's hit it!<eos> Phloem sap.<eos> Phloem what?<eos> Sap.<eos> Like from a tree?<eos> See, while the barbecue flames managed to broil the better part of these boots, they didn't singe off everything.
I had to set you off, Duke.<eos> The Troubles are based on emotion, so you needed some big ones.<eos> What the hell did you do to me?<eos> You'll see.<eos> I really am sorry, Duke.<eos> But you really are kind of awesome now.<eos> - How you doing?<eos> - I lost my keys.<eos> - Can I help you look for them?<eos> - They'll turn up.
I'm Duke Crocker.<eos> Right.<eos> Hi.<eos> Look, I know that you helped Audrey and Dave Teagues.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I need you to help me too.<eos> You see, I have a lot of troubles in me.<eos> And now it seems that I am... giving them out.<eos> What do you mean, giving them out?<eos> These black tears come out of my eyes, and then they float onto people, and... And then they get a trouble.
How far do they go?<eos> I mean, what if a troubled person went out to sea or wherever?<eos> It usually includes us writing a story about some freak squall or strange current.<eos> I need an answer!<eos> It's important.<eos> I'm afraid troubles always find people.<eos> So there is no good place to expel a trouble?<eos> Or a lot of them?<eos> No.<eos> Except, I imagine, where they came from.
Because I knew you'd get all weird and ask a million stupid questions.<eos> What does he look like?<eos> How did you meet him?<eos> Okay, I'll show you a photo.<eos> Well, I would, but now my phone's not working.<eos> Oh, here he is.<eos> In the supermarket flyer?<eos> That's him pondering the pork chops?<eos> What's to ponder?<eos> They're $4.59 a pound.
No complaints from anybody.<eos> Everyone seems to really like him.<eos> He played baseball in junior college and went out on an injury, but he's been a bus driver ever since.<eos> Never been married, no whack job ex-girlfriends that we know of?<eos> No.<eos> I talked to his family and friends.<eos> He doesn't come across as someone with enemies.<eos> We ran her prints from the crime scene, but nothing came up in the database.<eos> Most female stalkers don't target strangers.<eos> It's usually someone they've had previous contact with.
You're living with somebody?<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Well, you were kind of homeless for a while, and I didn't want you to think I was showing off.<eos> That's amazing.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Gets better!<eos> She got me this sweet gig selling cars at her dad's dealership.<eos> Hang on.<eos> You have a legitimate job?<eos> Yeah, the cars are easy to sell, too, 'cause they're from Korea, which I'm sure you know is the new Japan.
And, in hindsight, it's helped me realize a few things.<eos> About you.<eos> Me.<eos> Us. So here goes.<eos> It all started with a news report last week...<eos> WJGZ breaking news.<eos> Good evening.<eos> I'm Guy Ross. The nation's capital tonight is experiencing a city-wide Internet shutdown.<eos> And WJGZ has just received word that the interruption of service may be the result of a group of coordinated hackers.<eos> Federal authorities say they are looking into the matter, but there is no immediate cause for alarm, which has many questioning:
Believe it or not, before all of this,<eos> I was a good teacher.<eos> I taught my students right and wrong.<eos> To clean up their messes.<eos> Krampus isn't in Wisconsin.<eos> But you know where he is, don't you?<eos> Left a mess I have to clean up now.<eos> That happens to be rule number 45.<eos> And what I slowly realized Gibbs's rules are all about.<eos> What they're meant to prevent.
VonDorothy was arrested and taken into custody.<eos> I told you I'd get into MTAC.<eos> There he is.<eos> Our Cyber and Special Operations<eos> Division have recovered hard drives thought to contain vital security Intel stolen from Washington, DC, Internet servers late last night.<eos> Nice, Tim.<eos> The case helped me recognize all the hard, thankless work you put in over the years.<eos> That while I've learned a lot from Gibbs, it's only possible because of how I was raised.<eos> By you.<eos> You may not have numbered your rules, Dad, but... they were meant to teach the same lessons.
- Where's the eye?<eos> The Kalabrian Forest.<eos> They say it is cursed, a place of sorcery of the darkest kind.<eos> Why is it never a sun kissed meadow or a pretty olive grove?<eos> It's scared.<eos> It senses what lies in the forest.<eos> We will have to continue on foot.<eos> He's very quiet.<eos> I imagine he's thinking about what the grey sisters told him. - And?<eos> Why did they say that Jason and Medea's fates were entwined?

It's too stressful having three blokes on the go.<eos> Plus, my fanny can't take the pace.<eos> Right, all I need to do is add all this up and work out exactly how many points each boy scored.<eos> It's going to take ages.<eos> It's interesting how you haven't scored any boy 10 out of 10 for anything.<eos> The highest is Tonka's 9 for his ability to hold his breath underwater.<eos> Joint with Connor's 9 for pet care.<eos> He loves that salamander.<eos> You'd have to think someone was pretty fucking amazing to give them a 10, right?<eos> God, Saz, you're not just going up to people and asking them if they gave you a 10, are you? No!
Next Thursday?<eos> Your birthday?<eos> Wait. Is this because you want three lots of birthday presents?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Look, there's my picture!<eos> Why is your picture in the newsletter?<eos> "Sixth-Former Amber Dean tells us how she feels "about being asked to attend a trial for Chelsea Ladies."<eos> "'I feel amazing.<eos> It's a shame my mates didn't get picked out," "'but they just aren't talented enough.'"

To curb any impulse that may set you apart from others, but today we honor your differences, for they have determined your future.
- Wait, that says ...?<eos> - Don't be gullible.<eos> "Plan for sameness."<eos> - Another trick?<eos> - Actually, no.<eos> It's some kind of ..<eos> The triangle of Rocks!<eos> Hey that's real, my friend Asher actually saw it!<eos> Look at all this towers ...<eos> What are they for?
What's with your face?<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> My head just hurts a bit.<eos> It must be because I'm tired.<eos> Then, shall we get off work now?<eos> There are still some things that I need to do, so I'm not sure.<eos> I'll have a look first.<eos> Ok.<eos> But Gun, I don't see the pictures of us that used to be on the desk.<eos> Where did they go?

You shouldn't leave your stuff lying around.<eos> Thank you, Mr Mignard.<eos> Why do you want to evict him?<eos> It's a political issue.<eos> See this?<eos> It's with this that I do politics.<eos> Evicting people is politics?<eos> Get in the car.<eos> Yes, politics is kicking people when they're down.<eos> He gave me some apples, they were delicious.
You don't pass up a chance like that.<eos> What's the point of being a Sin City cop, if you don't get the perks?<eos> I'm a married man, Bob.<eos> I don't care what you are.<eos> I mean, just take a look at that babe.<eos> That's enough, Bob.<eos> This doesn't look good.<eos> One squad car still chases us.<eos> Must be a rookie driving.<eos> His buddies should have told him the girls of Old Town have laws all their own. And they don't take kindly to cops.
Ava was a rat in a maze. And I gave her one way out.<eos> To escape, she'd have to use self-awareness, imagination, manipulation, sexuality, empathy, and she did.<eos> Now, if that isn't true Al, what the fuck is?<eos> So my only function was to be someone she could use to escape?<eos> And you didn't select me because I'm good at coding? No.<eos> Well...<eos> No. I mean, you're okay.<eos> You're even pretty good, but...<eos> You selected me based on my search engine inputs.<eos> They showed a good kid.
- I understand me.<eos> Girls!<eos> Hello, my lovely.<eos> Granny, you've got to be in the contest like Hermeline.<eos> To show we're a real team.<eos> And you can make the costumes.<eos> All the mums can make the costumes, except you.<eos> Neither can I.<eos> Like mother like daughter.<eos> They neither sew nor cook.

Dude, you're just gonna shoot some random fucking geeks like that?<eos> - Hey, mom.<eos> - How're you doing?<eos> - Good party?<eos> - Yeah. Better in 30 seconds.<eos> It was pretty cool being able to bring two fine and flexible girls whose name I didn't know back to my bedroom.<eos> Oh, come on. I think mom got a kick out of it.<eos> A year ago, I couldn't approach a girl if she was naked and calling my name with a 40-ouncer in each hand.<eos> But I never fooled myself into thinking I was getting babes because of my looks or my thumb size and curved dick.<eos> I'd like to think they would've come back for seconds even if I went back to delivering pizzas.
Nobody was frightened.<eos> You were pathetic.<eos> I have a reputation to maintain.<eos> He was scary. I was petrified.<eos> Of course.<eos> She can't see beyond her nose.<eos> I couldn't see a thing, but it seemed a lot of fun. Congrats!<eos> Thanks.<eos> Did you try the glasses?<eos> They're all twisted or broken.
- Okay.<eos> But I feel uncomfortable around those people.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the First Lady of New York City, Cathleen Hostetler.<eos> - We did it!<eos> Equality has finally come to New York.<eos> Some said that now wasn't the right time to wage this fight.<eos> Well, I say there's never a wrong time to fight for what is rightfully yours.<eos> I say there is never a wrong time to stand up to the bullies.<eos> Even if they're powerful bullies.<eos> Especially if they're powerful bullies.
I'm assuming the same shit works for you?<eos> Real fucking smart answer!<eos> Why don't you fucking aim, huh? I have a particularly explosive ejaculate.<eos> It just goes everywhere. It's like a fucking wild fireman's hose.<eos> You just got to grab on and pray to God it doesn't get in your eyes or your mouth.<eos> The fuck kind of jerking off is that?<eos> What, you never had any brothers?<eos> You didn't learn to jizz in a fucking sock or on a fucking tissue?<eos> No, I don't have any brothers. I was raised in a house of women!<eos> I highly doubt they fucking taught you to fucking close your eyes and fucking cum wherever you want!
Home. lwant to go home.<eos> Thanks for the water.<eos> Eric.<eos> I don't know why, but I thought this would end it.<eos> But this book does not burn.<eos> It does not fucking burn.<eos> Tell me what's going on here.<eos> This book uses some... ancient alphabet.<eos> There's some translations, but... Just scattered notes.<eos> They all refer to some evil entity.
Don't you worry, kid.<eos> I'm taking you to the hospital, and they'll patch you up in no time.<eos> You'll be right as rain.<eos> I believe I have made a significant find in the Candarian Ruins...<eos> A volume of ancient Sumerian burial practices and funerary incantations.<eos> It is entitled "Naturom Demonto. " Roughly translated, "Book of the Dead."<eos> The book is bound in human flesh and inked in human blood.<eos> It deals with demons, demon resurrection, those forces which roam the forest and dark bowers of man's domain.<eos> The first few pages warn that these enduring creatures may lie dormant, but are never truly dead.<eos> They may be recalled to active life through the incantations presented in this book.
I'm lucky.<eos> But honey, I can't sleep.<eos> You go to bed, I come down here.<eos> I tinker.<eos> Threat is imminent.<eos> And I have to protect the one thing that I can't live without.<eos> That's you.<eos> And my suits, they're...<eos> Machines.<eos> They're part of me.
Some things, once you've loved them, become yours forever<eos> And if you try to let them go they only circle back and return to you.

You're pathetic.<eos> You needed him as much as he needed you.<eos> Now I know how you felt.<eos> When?<eos> When you wanted to die.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it.<eos> Some things, once you've loved them,<eos> become yours forever<eos> And if you try to let them go they only circle back and return to you.

Don't be long? Okay.<eos> I'll be right back, baby. - A beautiful couple.<eos> - He's the best.<eos> You won't regret it.<eos> I promise you.<eos> Congratulations. Thank you, Judy.<eos> I don't think I could've done that without you.<eos> Oh, sure you could've.<eos> Laughing at all my jokes, telling him what great ideas I have.<eos> They are great ideas.
Look at me!<eos> Look at me.<eos> - You're beautiful, Mom.<eos> I was beautiful.<eos> Hah..<eos> Not anymore.<eos> - Oh, now --<eos> You're still beautiful.<eos> One of those lies we tell to give us comfort.<eos> Women are beautiful, when they're young and not after.
Men can still preserve their sex appeal into old age. Not those men like you see with shorts, and little purses around their waists.<eos> - Lord.. lord.<eos> Some men can maintain a weary masculinity.<eos> Women just get old.. ..and fat and wrinkly.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> I'm still very sexy.<eos> Thank you very much. - Yeah, you're about as sexy as a wet cardboard box, Mattie Fae.<eos> you and me both.<eos> Look, wouldn't we be better off all of us, if we stopped lying about these things, ..and told the truth?<eos> "Women aren't sexy when they're old."
Is there a younger woman involved?<eos> - You've said enough on this topic.<eos> Yes.<eos> There's a younger woman.<eos> - Well, Y'see?<eos> Odds're against you there, babe.<eos> Mom believes women don't grow more attractive with age.<eos> Oh, I disagree, I..<eos> - No..<eos> I didn't say they "don't grow more attractive,"

So, you got to make all your problems yourselves.<eos> Why are you screaming at us?<eos> Just time we had some truth's told 'round here.<eos> Damn fine day, to tell the truth.<eos> Well, the truth is...<eos> I'm getting full.<eos> - Amen.<eos> There's dessert, too.<eos> She baked pies.<eos> They look so lovely.
I'm just telling the truth.<eos> - You're a drug addict.<eos> That is the truth!<eos> That's what I'm getting at!<eos> Hey, everybody. Everybody listen...<eos> I am a drug addict.<eos> I love drugs.<eos> Specially, pills, specially downers.<eos> Y'see these little blue babies?<eos> These are my best fucking friends, ..and they never let me down.
Help them.<eos> Draw your sword, Oishi.<eos> Save them.<eos> Chikara!<eos> A gift not forgotten.<eos> You passed their test.<eos> Your men are safe.<eos> You've got your swords.<eos> What's so special about these swords?<eos> What do they do?
You passed their test.<eos> Your men are safe.<eos> You've got your swords.<eos> What's so special about these swords?<eos> What do they do?<eos> It depends.<eos> On what?<eos> Who uses them.<eos> What about a tall, strong, brave man like me?<eos> They cut.
I've met him.<eos> Really?<eos> Which one?<eos> The prince?<eos> The spy?<eos> The murderer?<eos> I cannot find anyone... who knows anything real about... Mr. Gatsby.<eos> Well, I don't care.<eos> He gives large parties... and I like large parties.<eos> They're so intimate.
And the girlie was carrying these.<eos> Where is Mariah Mundi?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> So much for loyalty, you little char.<eos> Mariah, your amulet.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's getting brighter.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means that I've been digging in the wrong place.<eos> It appears that when both halves of the amulet are close to the location of the box at the same time, they glow.
It's not how we think about it, but it's something you can say quickly, and the person you're talking to won't, you know, get diverted or pass out or pick up the SkyMall catalog<eos> if you happen to be next to them on an airplane.<eos> Answer number one:<eos> we are reproducing the physics, the conditions, just after the big bang.<eos> We're doing it in this Collider, and we're reproducing that so we can see what it was like when the universe just started.<eos> This is what we tell people.<eos> Okay, answer two:<eos> we are trying to understand the basic laws of nature.<eos> It sounds slightly more mild, but this is really where we are and what we're trying to do.<eos> We study particles, because just after the big bang, all there was was particles, and they carried the information about how our universe started and how it got to be the way it is and its future.
Clear passage here, please.<eos> Clear passage here, please.<eos> Can we have a clear passage?<eos> - Thank you. - Thank you.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I did feel a sense of pride when the Higgs was announced, but I felt a sense of pride for humanity, that, you know, we little people on a little planet with tiny brains can go so deep and understand what happens.<eos> Now we're talking about subnuclear distances a thousand times smaller than an atomic nucleus.<eos> Nevertheless, we can get things right, and just the power of the human mind.<eos> It's astonishing that there are any laws of nature at all, that they're describable by mathematics, that mathematics is a tool that humans can understand, that the laws of nature can be written on a page.
Sings it in the shower.<eos> - I do not. - Yes, you do!<eos> I got you.<eos> Where are your sisters?<eos> I can't find them.<eos> You.... go to the house with them?<eos> No. What are you talking about?<eos> - Earlier?<eos> - No.<eos> What? They were supposed to come down earlier and get you.
- I do not. - Yes, you do!<eos> I got you.<eos> Where are your sisters?<eos> I can't find them.<eos> You.... go to the house with them?<eos> No. What are you talking about?<eos> - Earlier?<eos> - No.<eos> What? They were supposed to come down earlier and get you.<eos> They didn't come?
It's starting to rain.<eos> - Did you check by Maria's swing?<eos> They're getting whupped when they get here.<eos> Sorry, Grace. I whup kids.<eos> What? So they weren't there either?<eos> - They must be at home.<eos> - Are they here?<eos> - They weren't there?<eos> - No, they're not at the house.<eos> They're not there.
Back, back.<eos> Let them walk.<eos> - Alex!<eos> - Come on, Alex.<eos> You took those kids, didn't you?<eos> I just want to talk.<eos> He's a free man, I'm a free man!<eos> - No! - Hey!<eos> Tell me what you did with them! Tell me!<eos> They didn't cry until I left them.
He's not a person anymore.<eos> No, he stopped being a person when he took our daughters.<eos> I need your help.<eos> This is your last chance.<eos> I know you're scared.<eos> I know you wanna go home.<eos> All right?<eos> I know.<eos> I don't want to hurt you. I don't.<eos> I'm gonna take the tape off, and I want you to tell me where they are.
All right?<eos> I know.<eos> I don't want to hurt you. I don't.<eos> I'm gonna take the tape off, and I want you to tell me where they are.<eos> Hey. Come on.<eos> Did you see my glasses?<eos> What?<eos> I can't see.<eos> If you're not gonna talk, Alex, I'm gonna have to hurt you.<eos> Tell me where they are.

Come on.<eos> Did you see my glasses?<eos> What?<eos> I can't see.<eos> If you're not gonna talk, Alex, I'm gonna have to hurt you.<eos> Tell me where they are.<eos> Where are they?
You gonna tell us? If you don't, I'm gonna use this.<eos> Fine.<eos> You're doing this to yourself.<eos> Just tell us.<eos> Tell me.<eos> Tell me!<eos> Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!<eos> Where's my daughter?<eos> Four days have passed since Anna Dover and Joy Birch... were last seen by their families.<eos> The two girls, aged 6 and 7, are believed to have been... playing on this street when they disappeared without a trace.
As we for--<eos> He explain this before he ate the bullet?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Fuck your sorry.<eos> Save it for the girls' parents.<eos> I don't know what to do, Alex.<eos> I don't know what to do anymore.<eos> And what's completely fucked up about all this is I know you know where they are.<eos> I think we're done.<eos> They're in the maze.
Then if yours holds, I will have no choice but to kill you and your entire crew.<eos> If you destroy our ship, you will also destroy your own people.<eos> Your crew requires oxygen to survive, mine does not.<eos> I will target your life support systems located behind the aft nacelle.<eos> And after every single person aboard your ship suffocates, I will walk over your cold corpses to recover my people.<eos> Now, shall we begin?<eos> Lower shields.<eos> A wise choice, Mr. Spock.<eos> I see your 72 torpedoes are still in their tubes.<eos> If they are not mine, Commander, I will know it.
Ripping out their hearts.<eos> And skinning them is also nice.<eos> Yeah, but burning is the best way.<eos> 'Cause that's the only way to be safe.<eos> - Burning, yeah, of course.<eos> - Burn them all.<eos> Is it true that witches can't harm you?<eos> Well, no, that is horseshit, son.<eos> Their magic doesn't work on us.<eos> And they haven't killed us, yet.
You were clean.<eos> Yeah, but only the dark witches bear the signs.<eos> Dark witches?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Think about it, if their spells don't work on you, why would mine?<eos> I'm not like them, Hansel.<eos> Gretel.<eos> Shit.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - They have my sister.
Shit, dude.<eos> What is this?<eos> What is all this?<eos> - Whoa!<eos> - Where are we?<eos> I don't know.<eos> How many people do you think died here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> People die everywhere.<eos> They don't just come to the morgue and keel over.
Same rules apply.<eos> And that's why the Craft's been so good for me, Bruce.<eos> Everyone's accepted.<eos> Enough of that shite.<eos> Are you getting any at home, Bladesey?<eos> Well, that side of things hasn't improved.<eos> This crank caller just won't stop phoning Bunty.<eos> It's affecting her, you know...<eos> Thing about women, you have to shag them regularly.<eos> You keep them fucked, man, they will do absolutely anything for you.
So, do not think of it as a drink.<eos> Think of it as pain killer.<eos> I always drink with friend.<eos> Never alone.<eos> I have many rules, most I break. But never that one.<eos> So, Zivjeli.<eos> Live long.<eos> Zivjeli.<eos> I'm felling you, these women are beautiful.<eos> They fuck all night, I'm not kidding you.
- I hope your boyfriend feels better.<eos> That was my ex-girlfriend.<eos> Dude, you're really fishhooking me over this new manual.<eos> Is fishhooking good or bad?<eos> - You enjoy being fishhooked?<eos> - I've never been fishhooked.<eos> - Take a guess. - Probably not.<eos> Definitely not.<eos> Nobody wants to be fishhooked.<eos> All those girls in high school you fishhooked, they didn't like it.

You mean besides your horns?<eos> Well, no, that's exactly what I mean.<eos> So you can see them?<eos> Well, shouldn't you both be shocked or something?<eos> I think if I saw someone with horns, I'd piss down my leg.<eos> Well, they're kinda hard to remember.<eos> I mean, every time I look away from you for a second...<eos> I kinda forget that you even have them.<eos> Okay, but what are they?<eos> I mean, do you, you know... do you think they could they be cancerous?
Thank you.<eos> And there's something I would like to give you.<eos> Here.<eos> Merrin's mother, she gave this to her just before she...<eos> You know, son, I think...<eos> I think you need this even more than I do.<eos> I think you need her to keep you safe.<eos> Well now... I guess maybe that's some kind of blessing after all.<eos> The horns weren't a curse, but a blessing.<eos> They had guided me this far.
We're not only animals, we're the worst animals there are.<eos> Why do we eat meat?<eos> The Greek gods dined on ambrosia and nectar, but we need to incorporate other species into us.<eos> Look at Christianity.<eos> "This is my body. This is my blood."<eos> That's why I'm doing this chapter about the genocide in Rwanda.<eos> The Tutsis were vegetarians, and the Hutus were ranchers, who eat meat, and they regarded the Tutsis as monkeys, as animals, and that's why they had no trouble killing them.<eos> Don't you think?<eos> Honestly, Ben, I don't know why the farmer and the cowhand can't be friends.<eos> But I do know that part of the reason why some people regard other people as animals is because they don't observe the social conventions most of us take for granted.
We got a late start.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It doesn't matter. You're here.<eos> I just wish I could see him.<eos> I just wish he could see that beard.<eos> Your coat smells weird.<eos> I'm just saying... I think we sort of have to step up into the role of adults now and decide what's going to happen with the estate.<eos> I have some ideas, some of which I actually ran past Dad, so I know he wasn't opposed, about basically dealing with the store.<eos> How are the ribs?<eos> They're good.

The end. El final, unless we figure a way out.<eos> You got something?<eos> Yes, Furley, I knew your big freaking cabeza was good for something!<eos> Furley, that's a flying pony.<eos> Two birds and a handful of grain.<eos> This feast will be more of a fast at the rate we're going.<eos> Makes you wonder if Captain Standish is losing his edge.<eos> You were wondering what?<eos> Uh... Nothing, Captain.<eos> The problem with you boys is you're thinking about where them turkeys are and not where they ain't.

That's just workmanship.<eos> What you displayed was real courage.<eos> Your father would have been more than proud.<eos> He would have marvelled at the woman you've become.<eos> Zim Zallah Bim!<eos> Excellent work, everyone.<eos> Now we're ready in case anyone wants to speak with the Wizard.<eos> Now, remember...<eos> Oscar Diggs died, so that the Wizard of Oz could live.<eos> When those witches come back, and they will come back... we're going to need everyone to believe.
If you so order, Uncle, but be warned, this foul invasion, that you think so sweet, shall turn to bitter gall before the end.<eos> Speak, sir.<eos> You are too grave for one who cuts a country dance.<eos> If I profane with my own worthiest hand this holy shrine... my lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.<eos> Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much.<eos> Which mannerly devotion shows in this, for saints have hands that pilgrim's hands do touch, palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.<eos> Have saints not lips, and holy palmers, too?<eos> Aye, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.<eos> Oh, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do.<eos> They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

Newsflash, you're not special.<eos> Fuck with the queen bee and you're gonna get stung.<eos> Date ditch.<eos> Party at my house! Pathetic.<eos> Simon, you can drive us.<eos> Holy shit. What are you doing?<eos> Just needed to see my Robin, I guess.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Those girls, they're... They're evil.
- Can you believe it?<eos> Um, kitchen.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay<eos> - Can you believe it?<eos> - This place is so nice.<eos> - This place is huge.<eos> - I know, right?<eos> - Mom, can I pick out my room?<eos> - Well, yes, after your sisters, 'cause they're older than you, so they get first choice.
- What do you say?<eos> Rip the Band-Aid right off.<eos> - Huh?<eos> - All right.<eos> How's the sermon going?<eos> Oh, fine.<eos> Good.<eos> The usual battle.<eos> How are the girls?<eos> They're good.
US Army, World War II.<eos> Lot of people think this is a Luger. This is not.<eos> It's a Walther P38.<eos> Your dad was in the war, right?<eos> Yeah, tank gunner.<eos> Yeah, but...<eos> Which side was he on?<eos> So, Richard, you're telling me all these herbs come from your own garden?<eos> Yeah, from the fall.<eos> They're dried now.
Look out!<eos> Clear!<eos> Clear!<eos> Look out!<eos> It is about belief.<eos> Faith.<eos> Trust.<eos> Without those qualities, magic, as an art form, would no longer exist.<eos> But what happens if these qualities are not used for their higher purpose?<eos> And instead they're used to cheat, lie.
How I want to meet you.<eos> -All my love, Charlie.<eos> -All my love, Charlie.<eos> You've reached the Middlebend Sheriff's Department non-emergency number.<eos> If this is an emergency, please hang up and dial 911.<eos> Otherwise, please hold for the next available operator.<eos> Middlebend Sheriff's Department, how may I help you?<eos> Hello?<eos> My father had the exact same sunglasses.<eos> He wore them only when he was driving so they were always in the glove compartment.

What the hell happened down there?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'm good.<eos> I saw the bottom.<eos> They're not there.<eos> Skipper, it's Irwin.<eos> There's footprints here.<eos> There's two pairs.<eos> What?<eos> Where are they headed?
Nothing.<eos> I'm good.<eos> I saw the bottom.<eos> They're not there.<eos> Skipper, it's Irwin.<eos> There's footprints here.<eos> There's two pairs.<eos> What?<eos> Where are they headed?<eos> They're crossing the rift valley.

- But it's not even connected!<eos> - Yeah I disconnected it all out.<eos> What a hidden treasure, my darling!<eos> Did you make that?<eos> Well, I cabled it together from bits and pieces.<eos> How beautiful! You're an alchemist!<eos> I just need to check the charges and the connections.<eos> This may need a calibration.<eos> - Are these the antennas?<eos> They're receiving electrical information from the atmosphere.

It seems random. But it's not.<eos> There's an epicenter, right there.<eos> Meaning?<eos> You took out that one particular ship, and the rest just gave up?<eos> Why?<eos> To what animals are the Formics most often compared?<eos> - Ants.<eos> - Which have...<eos> A queen... Who directs the worker ants.<eos> What she thinks, they do.

Come on, it's time to go.<eos> I'm gonna get you some clothes.<eos> But for now...<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm not allowed to wear clothes.<eos> Hey, you're allowed to do whatever you want.<eos> You're not a slave and neither are those other women.<eos> Put...<eos> You shouldn't have let them in his house.<eos> They're not allowed, just me.
Hey, listen, man, it was worth every minute.<eos> Every single minute!<eos> I just got one thing to say, that's God bless America and long live the King!<eos> The King lives on.<eos> - That was amazing. - Well, thank you, sir. - Thank you very much.<eos> - Just amazing.<eos> Thank you, sir!<eos> Thank you very, very much.<eos> Say, I just wanted to ask you. What's with these here flag ladies? They done smell like shit.<eos> I thought they were with your show.

So many dead bodies.<eos> Odd, you have to stop this from happening.<eos> Oh, Odd, is there any hope this could pass?<eos> If you listen to Oddie, you'll be just fine.<eos> No.<eos> Fate is not a straight road.<eos> There are many forks in it.<eos> You have the free will to choose which one you take, but... sometimes it will bend around... and bring you straight back to that same stubborn fate.<eos> I just wanna check on the girls.<eos> They're so beautiful, Viola.

Don't tell the girls where you're going.<eos> I don't want you overheard.<eos> - By who?<eos> - By anyone.<eos> Or anything.<eos> Just go with it.<eos> Step two is don't go bowling if for some reason you get the itch.<eos> I can't believe we're leaving those horrid things... hovering around those sweet girls.<eos> They won't hurt em.<eos> They just want to smell em before they die.
- E-mail her.<eos> - Okay, perfect.<eos> Yeah, let's do it. Make a reservation someplace great.<eos> Yeah? I've got just the place.<eos> Who is that talking?<eos> Oh, that's my friend Samantha.<eos> - Is she a girl?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I hate women.<eos> All they do is cry all the time.
She was cracking me up.<eos> - She's hilarious. I had no idea.<eos> - Oh, cool.<eos> This is my girlfriend, Tatiana.<eos> She's not funny, she's a lawyer. - Hi.<eos> - Oh, hi.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> You're the writer Paul loves.<eos> He's always reading me your letters.<eos> They're really beautiful.
And you're right, I'm in no state to deal with this.<eos> So what's it gonna be, Mr. Mastermind?<eos> An Arab sheik?<eos> What do we want an Arab sheik for?<eos> Well, how do you think this works' stupid?<eos> If you could not call him stupid, which he isn't.<eos> He's smarter than you. Last time I checked, he's in control and we work for him now, so be nice, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> To set this up, to bust the con artist, we need to make the honeypot to attract the bees.<eos> To attract the bees, we need to offer them a wealthy individual who they can take advantage of.
Sixteen years.<eos> Yeah? Wow.<eos> That's a long time to stay in one place.<eos> - Are you married?<eos> - No. But I live with someone.<eos> - Chair of the English department.<eos> - You have kids? Thousands.<eos> Can you get these cows out of the way?<eos> Got it.<eos> They're enormous.
And did you know that women are the only exploited group in history to have been idealized into powerlessness?<eos> - Erica Jong.<eos> - Erica Jong, yeah.<eos> Hey, pups.<eos> Hey!<eos> Oh. Hi, Gloria.<eos> Hi, Betty.<eos> You're so skinny.<eos> Come on, let's get you something to eat.<eos> No, no! They're not skinny.
I'm here.<eos> A boy I know had this.<eos> It's a real book.<eos> For a museum.<eos> It's "Moby-Dick".<eos> He said I can even hold on to it.<eos> Hold on, to what?<eos> The book, dad.<eos> Do they really kill these whales?<eos> We, Senshi, for their oils and they almost disappeared.
Assange was undeterred from the WikiLeaks mission.<eos> And the hundreds of thousands of leaked U.S. government secrets he possessed were burning a hole in his pocket.<eos> Julian traveled around Europe plotting his next move, and in Brussels he was tracked down by investigative journalist Nick Davies.<eos> My pitch to Julian was, instead of posting this secret material on the WikiLeaks website, he shared it with an alliance of The Guardian and other media groups, including The New York Times.<eos> Who, A, have the impact of reaching millions of people instantly and also have natural political connections in their own jurisdictions.<eos> So we were trying to give him a kind of political immunity so that he could do this clearly provocative and somewhat dangerous thing in relative safety and with an assurance of success.<eos> Recognizing that WikiLeaks could benefit from a louder megaphone,<eos> Julian agreed to Nick's proposal.<eos> So, how am I going to get the documents back to London?<eos> There was a little bit of a risk that if the authorities were monitoring his communications, as they might well have been, they would be aware of my involvement with him, they would arrest me as I came back into the United Kingdom, and take the material if I had it on a laptop.
In Manning's buddy list, the address was listed under a familiar name,<eos> Julian Assange.<eos> On November 28th, 2010,<eos> WikiLeaks and its media partners began to publish a small fraction, carefully redacted, of the State Department cables supplied by Bradley Manning.<eos> The day-to-day memos of American diplomats revealed a surprising honesty about how the world really worked.<eos> It was that whole Wizard of Oz moment.<eos> We all look at these politicians, "Oh, wow, they're so powerful!"<eos> And then it was the little dog pulling the curtain away.<eos> The cables exposed criminal behavior and corruption by tyrants in Egypt, Tunisia, and Libya. That in turn helped to fuel an exploding popular anger against repression, the so-called Arab Spring.<eos> They also told the truth about the faults of America's so-called allies in ways that were bound to reveal that their power and legitimacy were a kind of fraud.
"He tore the condom."<eos> "I feel very uncomfortable about it."<eos> And then she told me Sofia called her about the same thing.<eos> She was very concerned she's pregnant or catch HIV because Julian had sex with her without a condom.<eos> They said if Julian takes an HIV test we won't go to the police.<eos> I tried actually to tell his friends that we can get this over with fast and with no fuss because I really didn't want this to be in the papers.<eos> But he chose to make a big deal out of it.<eos> Julian had repeatedly refused to have the test.<eos> When he had finally changed his mind and agreed to, it was too late.<eos> By that time, the women had already got too frustrated and too angry with Julian's refusals, and they'd gone to the police.

But Bob Gates is an incredibly honorable man.<eos> Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mike Mullen is an incredibly honorable man.<eos> I defer very much to their judgment that whatever was done was appropriate.<eos> The treatment that he was receiving at Quantico, the level of solitary confinement, the fact that his clothes were taken away at night, it was inconsistent with our values and our interests.<eos> It was making Bradley Manning a far more sympathetic figure than I see him.<eos> When I was asked about it in a forum at MIT,<eos> I gave a candid answer.<eos> State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said the treatment of Bradley Manning by the Pentagon is "ridiculous and counterproductive and stupid," and I'm wondering if you agree with that.<eos> I have actually asked the Pentagon whether or not the procedures that have been taken in terms of his confinement are appropriate and are meeting our basic standards.<eos> They assure me that they are.
- Hi, I'm looking for a Camille.<eos> - Camille Young? Yes?<eos> I'm with Cobu. I'm the manager.<eos> - Who? What are you talking about?<eos> - The group with girls and drums.<eos> I've seen their stuff.<eos> You gotta check them out.<eos> Amazing. And I came to give you this.<eos> It's tonight.<eos> They'll be there with a live audience. Everything you need to see them in action.
All right, my truck's out back. Okay.<eos> Oh, and they hand me a gun.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, put it away.<eos> So you get in the mind of the spider, really? I do.<eos> That's crazy. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a little nuts.<eos> E.T.A. 5 minutes.<eos> It's over here. Uh-oh, the lights don't work so good.<eos> It's cold in here.<eos> No, spiders don't like it cold.<eos> They like it warm. Dark and warm.
In my twenties, I created a tool called Rubberhose.<eos> It hid sensitive information beneath layers and layers of fake data.<eos> WikiLeaks is based on the same idea.<eos> Take any message.<eos> "Are you safe?"<eos> "Are you safe?"<eos> We constantly upload fake data from fake sources... to make it impossible to monitor our real sources.<eos> And their very presence is infinitely deniable.<eos> The system makes leaks untraceable.<eos> They simply turn up on the submission platform.
But, with an organization the size and scale of WikiLeaks... grassroots support is vital.<eos> Move the U.S. primaries to page three to make room for the Diana inquest.<eos> Yes, yes, yes.<eos> Diana still sells newspapers.<eos> Can't afford reporters?<eos> Grab a story off the wire... give it a little scrub, drop it in the paper.<eos> Twenty-first century churnalism at its finest.<eos> Is this how you're chatting up the totty in your golden years?<eos> Well, I certainly can't impress them... with some of the stories rattling around the mainstream media echo chamber.<eos> The women I meet are smart enough to know what they're missing out on.
Can you call the Pentagon, please?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay. I'm gonna be called into this Mubarak meeting as soon as we land.<eos> Can you brief me on this source? Yeah.<eos> Tarek Haliseh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Senior defense advisor to Gaddafi.<eos> The program code is a mess.<eos> There are ways to trace your sources.<eos> They aren't protected nearly as well as you say they are.
So she found out what had happened.<eos> I do not think I've made it yet.<eos> Stigge said that you were interested in his pictures. - Yes, he was a wonderful photographer.<eos> - You thought there might be an album?<eos> He would have thought about leaving something behind.<eos> There may still be an album.<eos> We just have to find Stigge's negative.<eos> There are some missing from the studio.<eos> Are you coming then or?<eos> I asked Stigge to take care of Bergman's pictures -so they would not end up in the wrong hands
-Oh, yeah.<eos> I was actually just about to go meet some friends.<eos> Hey, wait, wait.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm alone, too.<eos> Meet my friend, Ronny.<eos> Hey. We're on our way to a party.<eos> You wanna come?<eos> I was just trying to get that paint out of your hair, hon.<eos> Oh, paint chips are like the past, they follow me everywhere.
Alright. We can pick up where we left off.<eos> On two conditions.<eos> You just stop involving me in your private life.<eos> And the second?<eos> Is that you take this back.<eos> I didn't get excited about your Vaucanson for the money.<eos> I brought it back. It's in the car.<eos> And the new pieces too?<eos> You'll have to be patient for those.<eos> They're tied up with my private life.
Something the matter?<eos> Of course not.<eos> -I'm Elizabeth Lamb.<eos> -I'm...<eos> Mr.Maxwell.<eos> Please.<eos> Okay.<eos> You've come to find your car keys?<eos> Yep.<eos> They're just in here.
And now your mind is starting to think.<eos> So think about those keys.<eos> And you now can feel them in your hand.<eos> The shape.<eos> The metal.<eos> And you can see the color.<eos> Blue.<eos> They are on a blue key-ring.<eos> And your mind starts to think about the last time you remember them.<eos> I'm trying to walk and they're in my pocket.
So he'll feel a lot more pain.<eos> Once you complete the task, we'll release all the shackles from the legs.<eos> But if you play a trick, your elephant dies.<eos> Your action means the death of your elephant!<eos> If you defy his order again, your elephant is dead.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> We're actually looking for your friend, Mr. Kham.<eos> We found out that he has received a huge amount of money in his bank account.<eos> MAN: It's like you were saying, boss. We just received these photos.<eos> They were taken a few months back.
She should be dancing, not sewing.<eos> Excuse us a minute.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Rosie, please leave her to me. I have a feeling about her.<eos> She could be special. Ok.<eos> I want to talk with you.<eos> Times are changing.<eos> We got to compete with the moving pictures.<eos> If we want to keep serving the liquor we got to clean up the girls.<eos> They can't show so much.
Mr. Chow?<eos> Stuart?<eos> He's alive. He's okay.<eos> Great.<eos> Put him in the limo and come get us.<eos> We'll meet you at valet.<eos> That was some ride, pal?<eos> Yeah, it was pretty wild.<eos> I can't feel my nuts.<eos> Would you rub them and make sure they okay?
Thank you.<eos> We're honored to be here with you today.<eos> And to be with the families of your fallen Tributes.<eos> He put down the cards.<eos> - Though they fought and lived with honor...<eos> - Why do I bother?<eos> ...and dignity until the end, both Thresh and Rue<eos> were so young.<eos> But our lives aren't just measured in years.<eos> They're measured in the lives of people we touch around us.
It's a nasty cut.<eos> It was a nasty blow. Done with a bloody crowbar.<eos> - Why? What did you do? - Nothing.<eos> Only what she asked me to do.<eos> Which was...<eos> I'd be happy to show you, if you like.<eos> Oh! Sorry.<eos> I have a theory why women like racing drivers.<eos> It's not because they respect what we do, driving round and round in circles.<eos> Mostly they think that's pathetic, and they're probably right.

Sorry.<eos> I have a theory why women like racing drivers.<eos> It's not because they respect what we do, driving round and round in circles.<eos> Mostly they think that's pathetic, and they're probably right.<eos> It's our closeness to death.<eos> You see, the closer you are to death, the more alive you feel.<eos> The more alive you are. And they can see that in you.<eos> They feel that in you.
That's pretty ambitious.<eos> I read a lot of biographies, sir.<eos> And the one thing that unites great men is their reach always exceeds their grasp.<eos> One thing...<eos> I recently had some trouble with the law.<eos> They call Florida "God's waiting room,"<eos> all the half-dead senior citizens turning brown on the beach.<eos> Shit, you ask me, that's kind of mean.<eos> I like older people.<eos> They're very generous.
You deserve that.<eos> You want to be a monument to physical perfection?<eos> You want to be a shrine?<eos> You should be!<eos> You wanted change, right?<eos> All you got is change in that fanny pack. Is that what you want?<eos> When's the last time you paid your rent when it was due?<eos> When's the last time you took one of those plump bitches out to dinner and didn't sweat them ordering dessert?<eos> You love those big bitches.<eos> And they love to eat.
You do remember your high school days, don't you?<eos> Hell, yeah!<eos> I used to have a nickname for my di...<eos> I mean, penis.<eos> I used to call him Ernesto.<eos> I used to call my vag Michelle. What?<eos> Just leave it up to me and<eos> I'll have Ernesto up in high gear in no time.<eos> Those injections expensive, Doctor?<eos> They come with a price.
Boom, skyrocket.<eos> Next.<eos> Frankie!<eos> Chopin, stop!<eos> Come here. Meet my friends.<eos> Show them your tits.<eos> Look, you like them?<eos> I had the doctor put in an extra 500 c:c:'s.<eos> - Like Jell-O.<eos> - They're new.
- Okay, we've got to dance.<eos> - We've gotta dance!<eos> This way.<eos> I'm quite frightened cause you might find this cheesy... but it is one of my favorite songs from one of my favorite films.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> It's good, right?<eos> That's what I love about music. What?<eos> One of the most banal scenes is suddenly invested... with so much meaning.<eos> All these banalities.<eos> They're suddenly turned into these... these beautiful, effervescent pearls.
No!<eos> And they all died forever.<eos> All dead forever.<eos> Shut up, Fartwright.<eos> Bravo. Bravo!<eos> Mrs. Wattlesbrook, you're a genius.<eos> Such talent.<eos> Lady Heartwright, you make such a beautiful corpse.<eos> You!<eos> You know, I was aiming for your cans, but they're such a small target.
Well, neither have they.<eos> You'll fit right in!<eos> Can your ideas change the world?<eos> - Behold, the motivation pod.<eos> - Can your ideas...?<eos> I know, right?<eos> - Quinoa latte?<eos> - Absolutely!<eos> Can your ideas change the world?<eos> Yes, Chester V poster, they can!
The end product is steam, and then once you have steam, it's the same whether you generate the electricity with oil, or coal, or gas, or-- just as long as you have a source of heat.<eos> So, we generated electricity and then we hooked-up 4 light bulbs. And we lit the light bulbs from atomic energy.<eos> December 20, 1951<eos> Nobody else had done it before.<eos> But the fact that the whole nuclear business, atomic energy, was started for a bomb, and used as a bomb-- and I think that put the negative side on it.<eos> SAN ANTONIO, NEW MEXICO July 16, 1945<eos> I'm just old enough to have conscious memory of World War II, and the ending of World War II.<eos> MONUMENT AT TRINITY SITE White Sands, New Mexico First nuclear test site<eos> Nuclear bombs were not just a weapon.<eos> They were a little window into some kind of Armageddon.
Stop the fraud!<eos> If something looks like it's bad, we're holding up our hand and saying:<eos> "No, no, pl--please, we--we can't have that."<eos> I remember these big 'scare ads' in the papers.<eos> Getting people to organize-- rallies against Shoreham.<eos> There were many things that I didn't know at that time, that I've learned since.<eos> For one thing, it turn out, the ads were placed by the oil delivery industry.<eos> You know, the companies that deliver fuel to people on Long Island.<eos> And sure, the oil companies can say: "Go solar!"<eos> Because they know that it's never going to replace oil heat.
Welcome to London, the world's capital of surveillance<eos> Eventhough the year isn't 1984, you may be forgiven for imagining Big Brother really is watching you.<eos> I can see one, two... six, seven...<eos> fourteen, fifteen... eighteen cameras.<eos> On this spot.<eos> Every bit of public ground is monitored all the time, so that every single street.<eos> But also just because all the different companies, different Londoners, have their own CCTV cameras, so every spot is watched by everybody.<eos> In the most monitored city in the world, there is one camera for every 14 people.<eos> But does this intense surveillance keep Londoners safe?<eos> I mean, in a way these streets are kind of dangerous, because they're covered in CCTVs, but no one is watching.
Do you see?<eos> When it gets dark here it gets light over there.<eos> Much lighter than it can ever be here.<eos> Will you read to me?<eos> ls it about the tropics?<eos> No. I only got it from the lending library yesterday.<eos> It's by Paulino Reitz on the Rio Grande.<eos> He's a Catholic missionary.<eos> He explains in Portuguese how the different rainforest tribes talk to one another.<eos> And what do they say?
Well, I'll tell you what. It can't because it never started.<eos> I didn't shoot anybody.<eos> Yeah, we've got 17 weapons so far.<eos> Al's running numbers now, but none of 'em are a .223.<eos> Well yeah, it's all as Cindy said, but there's no prints, fibers, anything.<eos> Yeah well, we're running out of places to look.<eos> Probable insurance fraud.<eos> No, nothing on any girls.<eos> Most of us don't have much respect for a prostitute.<eos> They're beneath us, aren't they?
Yeah well, we're running out of places to look.<eos> Probable insurance fraud.<eos> No, nothing on any girls.<eos> Most of us don't have much respect for a prostitute.<eos> They're beneath us, aren't they?<eos> - I think so.<eos> - Why are they beneath us, Bob?<eos> Well, it's obvious.<eos> Didn't you find, growing up, that girls had a certain power over you?<eos> They know what boys want and they can dictate when they can have it.
- I think so.<eos> - Why are they beneath us, Bob?<eos> Well, it's obvious.<eos> Didn't you find, growing up, that girls had a certain power over you?<eos> They know what boys want and they can dictate when they can have it.<eos> Isn't it nice when we get older and we can turn the tables, dominate, take the lead?<eos> Isn't it? Determine when you touch them or whatever?<eos> - When you pay for it.<eos> And they won't reject you.<eos> You're paying for it, they'll do what you tell them. Then you pull out the gun and you're really in control.

Bender, you're not a folk singer just 'cause you have a guitar.<eos> And a flannel shirt.<eos> I claim I won it in a knife fight at J. Crew.<eos> It must be interesting to win a knife fight.<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> The point is... do you even know any actual folk songs?<eos> Actual folk songs are all public domain. Where's the money in that?<eos> I'll just make up my own.<eos> But, robot, you can't just make up folk songs like you can a medical diploma.<eos> They have to come from the heart.
Hey, Leela, Fry got his head stuck in a pot of honey!<eos> Oh, bother.<eos> Not now!<eos> What is it? Alcohol?<eos> Tobacco?<eos> Firearms?<eos> Firearms!<eos> That's the one I was secretly hoping for.<eos> I'm okay with most kinds of violence, but not gang violence.<eos> Before we deliver these weapons, we're going to disable them so they can never be used.
Miss, your dancing's really good!<eos> Not at all!<eos> Not as good as you!<eos> You're really good!<eos> Really!<eos> So may I go up and lure the Pig Demon now? Good!<eos> This guy looks really familiar.<eos> My love is gone, she'll never return.<eos> I silently mourn my lost love.<eos> Though flowers wither, they'll bloom again.
It's cherry pits.<eos> Hey, Burnsie!<eos> Burnsie, can we call him now?<eos> They found them.<eos> You're shitting me.<eos> They found the girls, alive.<eos> Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss, and you must be Annabel.<eos> I must be.<eos> Lucas.<eos> How are they?
It's okay.<eos> Dad?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss, Your Honor.<eos> The girls have been in my care at the Institute since they were found 87 days ago.<eos> And how would you define their progress?<eos> Solid, and astoundingly fast.<eos> If I may?<eos> Your Honor, Victoria and Lilly Desange were found in deplorable conditions, isolated, starved.<eos> They feared and distrusted all physical contact.
Jeffrey Desange murdered my niece and abandoned his daughters in the forest.<eos> Now, his brother did an extraordinary thing.<eos> Lucas never gave up on his nieces, but he did it for the girls, not for himself.<eos> So if he still has their best interest at heart, he must know that neither his salary nor his very small apartment are suitable for the raising of two children, let alone two children with very special needs.<eos> How many kids have you raised, Jean?<eos> About as many as you, Lucas.<eos> Of course she wants the girls, Lucas.<eos> Stand in her shoes for a second.<eos> She can't just sweep in and take them.<eos> They're not hers to take.
In a dream.<eos> Go on, Victoria.<eos> And you can't tell anyone where you are?<eos> Nope.<eos> That's just bizarre, dude.<eos> Yeah, well, it's for the girls, to keep the press away.<eos> It's so messed up, though.<eos> All families are messed up.<eos> Yeah, but this one's messed up and instant.<eos> Heck, I didn't even have the chance to screw 'em up, they came that way.
Chop, chop, chop. Chop, chop.<eos> I'm really sorry, Annabel.<eos> But they told me he responded well to the tests and it's very likely this coma's temporary.<eos> What happens now?<eos> I'm afraid I don't follow.<eos> The girls.<eos> Now that Lucas is not...<eos> The girls.<eos> Annabel, the girls need you.<eos> They need security, predictability.
If you don't, you'll lose custody and Lucas will be lucky if he sees his nieces every second Thanksgiving.<eos> Well, all checked out.<eos> All the doors and windows were locked, no evidence of an intruder, nothing stolen, so...<eos> So I imagined it then, yeah?<eos> All right, thank you, bud.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> Richmond's finest.<eos> Okay, guys, just you and me for a while.<eos> I don't know how you're feeling about that, but we don't got a choice.<eos> How have they been affected by all of this?
You just want me to clean up my mess.<eos> You don't give a shit about me.<eos> And I know it.<eos> I have been on my own all my life.<eos> Nobody even knows I'm here. Nobody ever knows where I am.<eos> Because there is nobody.<eos> I got sick, I took care of myself. I needed shit for school, I got it.<eos> You're so stupid.<eos> Do you think your fucking fancy suit and acting like an asshole is gonna make your daughters happy?<eos> You think that's what they want?
- You know Isis de Ponteauzanne?<eos> - Very well.<eos> We are... I know herwell.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> I'm the only one who's not...<eos> This feeling of solitude is dreadful!<eos> I demand to fall in love, too!<eos> Do your nieces have passions?<eos> I can try Chick's technique.<eos> Yes. They dance the biglemoi.
You were worried at first.<eos> Here we go again!<eos> How are you?<eos> How's it going?<eos> You look well.<eos> Of course I do!<eos> - Colin and Nicolas looked after me.<eos> - You look lovely.<eos> My cousins kept asking after you.<eos> They're charming, but not as firm as you.
- lt means he's the most knowledgeable.<eos> Or the best-known.<eos> - Knowledgeable.<eos> - Known.<eos> How are you, Chloé?<eos> Well, I think.<eos> And the pills?<eos> They're OK.<eos> What?<eos> They were dreadful!
Or the best-known.<eos> - Knowledgeable.<eos> - Known.<eos> How are you, Chloé?<eos> Well, I think.<eos> And the pills?<eos> They're OK.<eos> What?<eos> They were dreadful!<eos> They made you feel awful.
There's a bunch of people out there who are convinced they are possessed.<eos> Ivanwood, Louisiana.<eos> I think that the very gate to hell is over there, right off of Bush Drive.<eos> Cult in this area.<eos> It's a real mix of superstition and folklore down here.<eos> You've got voodoo, you've got Roman Catholics. Pentecostalism.<eos> I need you to do an exorcism for the soul of my daughter.<eos> - I like your shoes.<eos> - Want to try them on?<eos> They look good on you. They're yours.
Hope you're happy.<eos> May he have peace with God through our Lord, Jesus Christ, and rejoice in the hope of the Glory of God and not only so, but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience, experience and experience, hope...<eos> One.<eos> Two.<eos> Ten.<eos> Jack.<eos> Queen.<eos> King.<eos> The flowers are an offering for the Mother of Waters.<eos> They symbolise the desire to atone for any evil that the pilgrim has done in life.
Idiot.<eos> No, she--<eos> Ms. Cranston, report back to your team leader.<eos> Mr. Jessop, report back to base.<eos> Over.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> This place is one stop from hell.<eos> First stage decomposition.<eos> Temperature must have been over 52 degrees Fahrenheit for the blowflies to fly out of the cadaver.<eos> They also like salsa, playing poker, and they make a mean margarita.
You can't even tell what happened.<eos> Or, if something did happen, you can't tell.<eos> Oh, so I should be okay knowing that my wife might have been the headmaster?<eos> Well, you did marry a stripper.<eos> Yeah, but that didn't matter to me.<eos> If it didn't matter to you then, why in the hell is it mattering to you now?<eos> Could you just put your phone away, please? Thank you.<eos> Well, now I have two million dollars to raise.<eos> And I have two little girls!<eos> What if Keisha and Kelly decide they want to dance for money?
Which one of them, either Shelby or Candace is better at rocking the mic?<eos> Yeah, I don't remember.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> Murch, come on, man.<eos> Every man remembers his personal best headmaster.<eos> Co-sign.<eos> Yeah, and he should know.<eos> He's been with white chicks.<eos> They can do it.
How come an engineer knows so much about guns?<eos> Military service. Back home.<eos> So, what you said on the phone. Is that your plan?<eos> To get everybody into this warehouse?<eos> Yes.<eos> Alphonse is always there.<eos> I just need to get the Albanians there, too.<eos> There are many men.<eos> But your bombs doesn't work.<eos> They work.
She's asleep.<eos> Gj: No.<eos> Not now.<eos> She's looking for the girl?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> She's not here, lady.<eos> That's for free.<eos> Searchers search.<eos> All the bitches here are searching for love.<eos> And when they don't find that, for enlightenment.

Should she worry?<eos> Sometimes when people are silent it's because They're afraid of what they might say.<eos> People can make mistakes, you know.<eos> They can lose their temper and do things they regret.<eos> Is this yours?<eos> It's wet.<eos> Have you been out on a kayak?<eos> How'd it get wet?<eos> You know, when very young girls get pregnant, it's often innocent.<eos> They've been with a boy and it's...
We are two different people with different attitudes.<eos> We wander the world in style.<eos> Sometimes we go apart and come back.<eos> We live our lives in the moment our moods change like the seasons<eos> Though I am the north pole and you are the south<eos> The naughty north has given south a wink.<eos> Though I am the north pole and you are the south<eos> We will be together, forget about the whole world.<eos> Sometimes two roads travel side by side.<eos> They slowly converge at the end of the ride.
Oleg?<eos> - What do you do? - Thank you.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Hope you enjoy it.<eos> What are you doing in Moscow?<eos> CIA has a problem and has asked me for help.<eos> So I thought maybe you could...<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> - Wash your hands.<eos> - They're washed.
You have the best heart in the world, Poirot.<eos> The heart, no, but the brain - as magnificent as ever.<eos> Hastings, do stop, do!<eos> It is not a wheelbarrow.<eos> Sorry, old chap.<eos> So is it good to be back after all these years?<eos> The food, it is disgusting.<eos> Rationing, I suppose.<eos> No, it is the English cooking.<eos> And the water, always so tepid, and the towels so thin they're of no use at all.
You were right, Poirot.<eos> It was Iago.<eos> But of course.<eos> Did I miss anything?<eos> I do not know, Hastings. Did you?<eos> Oh, you did, Captain Hastings. I've never seen so many shooting stars.<eos> Where's Craven?<eos> Not sure.<eos> I need my drops.<eos> Where are they?
She m-meant the world to me.<eos> And you to her?<eos> She l-loved me... ..l-loved me more than...m-more than...<eos> Did she ever hold you, Norton, as mothers do, stroke your hair...kiss your cheek?<eos> She... She...<eos> Scared you, did she not?<eos> She pushed you away, starved you of what we all desire, because she knew everything about you.<eos> My mother knew nothing.<eos> Oh, Monsieur Norton, mothers know.<eos> They always know.
But it seemed not to do much good.<eos> She was never happy.<eos> And she had a great aversion to children.<eos> Oui.<eos> And that led to incidents most serious, n'est-ce pas?<eos> I heard what happened in her early life.<eos> I heard what happened in India.<eos> I have no first-hand knowledge of that.<eos> No, but there are events of which you do have the first-hand knowledge.<eos> Isn't it better to leave things when at least they have been accepted?
It is your only chance.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's just as you say.<eos> Bon. Mr Whalley?<eos> I came in and went straight over to the master, and there he was dead on the floor, blood all around.<eos> Then I got the wind up proper.<eos> They'd ferret out my record and say it was me who'd done him in.<eos> And the figures of ivory?<eos> They was gonna blame the murder on me anyway.<eos> The master had said how they was worth a lot of loot.
Of course you are.<eos> I was watching your door.<eos> My God...<eos> That's quite a drop.<eos> Sans blague.<eos> He will be injured.<eos> He already is. I think my shot went through his stomach.<eos> Will you excuse me? Oui.<eos> Oui bien, Poirot.<eos> The little grey cells...at last they begin to sing.
Your fascination with - oh - the method.<eos> Your eagerness always to know what it is that Poirot he is thinking.<eos> How deliciously pure it would be, mademoiselle, to conceal yourself under the wing of the very detective who searches for you.<eos> May I say I think that's very interesting but a little woolly... and...not quite out of the top drawer, sleuth-wise.<eos> Monsieur Waring. You are no stranger to deceit.<eos> That's a little harsh.<eos> Only a few hours ago you were telling me what an honourable man I was.<eos> Because it is your honour that leads you to deceit.<eos> Will you please fetch for me the ladies Madame Clayton and Madame Rice.<eos> They're halfway down the mountain.
Bees! Oh, bees!<eos> The boxes fell over on the way here when I had to swerve to avoid an ostrich.<eos> You got to do something about this--these people paid a lot of money. Do something!<eos> No, they won't listen to me.<eos> - They've all got CCD.<eos> - CCD?<eos> Colony collapse disorder.<eos> The guy sold me just really sick bees.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Dad, they're going to hive.

You know, I can't get away this time, you know.<eos> Maybe even though Michael had lied to him about it first.<eos> You know, just, I'm a super busy guy.<eos> - And back at the table... - So...<eos> I can't believe that a woman would support this guy.<eos> ...Lindsay found herself torn...<eos> And I assume by being with him, you just parrot his values.<eos> - ... between who she was with...<eos> -I don't appreciate you saying that, okay?<eos> I have my own values, Rebel, and believe it or not, they're closer to yours than you think.
Hmm...<eos> Look...<eos> Look at those gifts, crafted by the prisoners.<eos> Dr. Evert loved roses.<eos> Pretty crafty.<eos> I guess you weren't the only girl that loved her.<eos> It wasn't like that.<eos> I wouldn't have made it through my first year working for the Light Fae if it wasn't for her.<eos> She never would've abandoned her prisoners.<eos> - They were her patients.
You've been breeding prisoners.<eos> Well, the adoption market for unusual Fae is quite lucrative.<eos> Sylvie wasn't pregnant a couple of days ago.<eos> That's what was in those canisters.<eos> Some sort of magical sperm ... ew.<eos> - What kind of Fae can do that?<eos> - A Liderc.<eos> Trickster Fae capable of impregnating a host without detection.<eos> The oblivious mother finds herself delivering his baby mere days later.<eos> Then we wipe the mothers' memories, convince them they've re-offended out in the world...

She's not a giddy woman.<eos> She's doesn't jig about.<eos> I mean, singing is frivolous.<eos> It's wholly unnecessary in a governess, an educatress.<eos> No, it would simply ruin it.<eos> I won't have her turned into one of your silly cartoons.<eos> Now, Pam...<eos> I want you to know that the last thing I would do, the very last thing, is tarnish a story I have cherished.<eos> Now, the pages of your books are worn to tissue.<eos> They are dog-eared and falling out, because I have pored over them, gripped and tormented.
I'll brief him, though.<eos> Okay.<eos> This is the memo I drafted on our Middle East policy we've been developing.<eos> Now, I wanna borrow from Reagan,<eos> I'd like to coin the phrase "trickle-down diplomacy."<eos> - That way...<eos> - Frank, I'm going to stop you there.<eos> We're not nominating you for Secretary of State.<eos> I know he made you a promise, but circumstances have changed.<eos> The nature of promises, Linda, is that they remain immune to changing circumstances.
All right?<eos> Mummy told me what you said.<eos> You've always been a very clever girl.<eos> And I know that you see everything, even if you don't understand it.<eos> And you're right.<eos> I haven't been myself.<eos> You see, the thing is, someone accused me of doing something bad at work and I didn't do it.<eos> But no-one would believe me.<eos> Not even Mummy.<eos> And the funny thing is that when grown-ups get scared, they don't seem like themselves.
What are you fiddling with now?<eos> - Stop doing that.<eos> Because this guy is watching us, okay?<eos> - I need you to stop--<eos> - I know what I'm doing.<eos> - Just listen to me for two seconds.<eos> - I know what I'm doing.<eos> See, I went to school and I know things which is why I don't have to steal stuff, like some people.<eos> If you're so smart, you tell me what's going on with all these cameras, huh?<eos> They're all linked to a single feed.
It's just it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle.<eos> We're gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you're gonna have to do me a real solid.<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> When we get to customs, I'm gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and I'm gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty.<eos> In my butt?<eos> Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit.<eos> Oh, geez, Rick.<eos> I really don't want to have to do that.<eos> Well, somebody's got to do it, Morty.<eos> Th-these seeds aren't gonna get through customs unless they're in someone's rectum, Morty.

Warn me?<eos> Yeah, they might be swimming in the shallow end of the gene pool, but they're a fiercely loyal clan.<eos> Been in this town almost as long as my people.<eos> And they will be out for blood.<eos> I'll keep my eye out.<eos> Sheriff, I wouldn't be bothering you if I didn't think you have a serious problem on your hands.<eos> I don't deny your abilities.<eos> It's just that your hands are tied by this office, whereas I have a talent for resolving problems like this one quietly.<eos> I appreciate your concern, but...<eos> I think I'll just take things as they come.
Stop, stop!<eos> What's going on?<eos> Stop!<eos> Test.<eos> One, two.<eos> I can hear.<eos> Can you hear?<eos> Is everyone okay?<eos> Two people got hurt up here.<eos> They will be OK.
See you tonight.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm waiting.<eos> You've worked hard since last time.<eos> I can't fault your technique, but my calendar is full.<eos> Just stop, it's been five years of compliments and phony excuses.<eos> Just be honest for one second. Just for once.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Listen, Jeff.<eos> Your photos lack spirit. They lack soul.
Thank you.<eos> Can I go?<eos> Of course.<eos> Right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Tell me.<eos> As a professional, what do you think of my photos?<eos> Honestly?<eos> They're not so bad.
That would be too easy.<eos> It's your camera now.<eos> It's your story.<eos> - I need to understand...<eos> - I did warn you.<eos> But you just did as you pleased!<eos> I saw her.<eos> She's all I can see.<eos> Those poor lost souls. They always come back.<eos> They get into your head and never let go, that's how it is.
What's gotten into you today!<eos> I'm fed up, mom!<eos> Of this stupid life!<eos> That Aditi is going on a holiday with her friends... I study so much I can't even give myself a break on Sundays!<eos> And then you guys with your constant nagging!<eos> So... you... want to go on a holiday?<eos> Mom!<eos> There's food in the oven...<eos> And I've brought you mangoes.<eos> They're in the fridge.
- Extraordinary.<eos> The most extraordinary man they've ever had.<eos> And they've had a lot of men.<eos> We're talking about the same Podrick?<eos> The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service?<eos> Seems a bit simple?<eos> What did he do to them?<eos> I don't know, my lord.<eos> The girls are usually quite descriptive.<eos> So what did they say?

No, it's true.<eos> I've seen it.<eos> I rest my case.<eos> Did you take anything out?<eos> No, he doesn't want your money.<eos> He just does it for sport.<eos> You know, urn,<eos> I picked those flowers myself.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> They're really pretty.
- She likes to keep it here.<eos> - Where does she live?<eos> - Galärbacken.<eos> Right before the hotel.<eos> - What can you tell me?<eos> - TOD between midnight and 2 AM. - COD?<eos> - A heavy blow to the back of the head.<eos> They called from the lab.<eos> The analysis of those letters is ready.<eos> They weren't printed on Ulla Lennartsson's printers...
Yeah. We sure do.<eos> Sugar. Jewish people.<eos> There is no way we are going to let Sophie go to a party where they're serving beer.<eos> I don't care how much she kicks and screams.<eos> We're her parents and we tell her what she can and cannot do.<eos> Now, the way you're saying this, it sounds like you want me to be a part of it.<eos> If it bothers you so much, why didn't you tell the dad that Sophie couldn't go when you heard there was going to be beer at the party?<eos> Hmm... Why didn't you tell him, Annie?<eos> Hey, this is not about Sophie's new daddy right now. This is about the girls.<eos> They're not going to that party.
- I looked it up. It's the law.<eos> Get out!<eos> What a bust, huh?<eos> I'd say it was a total loss, but Jake invited me to a frat party on Thursday.<eos> Guess what I'm bringing.<eos> Seven-layer dip!<eos> Oh. This has not been a proud night for us, Nikki.<eos> They rarely are.<eos> But you know what? At least we found out we have good girls.<eos> Left on their own, they made the right choices.
Oh. This has not been a proud night for us, Nikki.<eos> They rarely are.<eos> But you know what? At least we found out we have good girls.<eos> Left on their own, they made the right choices.<eos> And you know why?<eos> We're good moms.<eos> Sophie stole my only pair of nice earrings.<eos> Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.<eos> But you know what?<eos> They didn't drink. And that's something.
You're an inspiration.<eos> The hell how can I help you, ladies.<eos> Oh, well.<eos> Sophie and McKenzie have applied to U. T. sophomore program.<eos> you know that college experience for high school students.<eos> It's an excellent program.<eos> Now, is McKenzie aware that it requires a minimum grade point average?<eos> If she passes her history final, she'll squeeze by<eos> Anyway the girls need a letter of recommendation from their principal.<eos> Oh, they sure do.
That's me.<eos> See, I actually don't think we have time for coffee.<eos> I'll meet you back at the office.<eos> Sure<eos> And I'll meet you backstage.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, that's how it's done.<eos> You cannot date her, Matt.<eos> You always do this.<eos> You date my assistants, then you dump them, then they quit, then I have to answer my phone in a female voice.
Hey.<eos> What?<eos> What's going on? Oh my god.<eos> Who's pregnant?<eos> Nobody.<eos> This is way better.<eos> The girls want to do something. But hear them out before you say no.<eos> Not fair, I never say no.<eos> Sophie and I want to join the cheer leading squad.<eos> But Annie they've been practicing so hard.
- That is correct.<eos> Let's go to your house.<eos> I told you she wouldn't let me.<eos> That's because she grew up in a cult.<eos> It was not a cult. It was a sect.<eos> There is a huge difference.<eos> We don't have to sleep with the leaders.<eos> Cheer leading Nikkie?<eos> Those girls tortured me in high school.<eos> They used to ? at me when I went to the bus.
I did had teeth like a baby shark.<eos> They gave me the self loathing I needed, to change.<eos> Yeah, you're not making as good of a case as you think you are. Come on Annie.<eos> I really want us to do this together.<eos> Plus it's a great way for us to be involved with the girls.<eos> We get to go the games, we get to go the competition.<eos> We get to be... cheer mums.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> The mums are worst than the daughters.<eos> They're snobby, they exclude people.

They're snobby, they exclude people.<eos> And who smells that nice all the time?<eos> It's like they shower everyday?<eos> Oh, that is pretty judgy.<eos> Maybe you should talk to these women before you start sucking your ? cigarette ?<eos> So have you talked to them?<eos> Have you talk to Sandra Bullock?<eos> No, but you just know she is a good person.<eos> Come on, Annie I haven't even told you the best part.<eos> In January, they'd go to a cheer leading conference in a little town called...
Kelsey B, Kelsey J, Kelsey R,<eos> I knew I should have named her Kelsey.<eos> She's not in the list.<eos> She didn't make it.<eos> You're ok, Nikkie?<eos> Of course I'm okay.<eos> I'm just worried about the girls.<eos> This is the type of things that can really tear up a friendship apart.<eos> Ow, honey I think they'll be fine.<eos> I mean they've been best friend since they were five.
Oh Nikkie.<eos> Nikkie.<eos> I know it's you. Why isn't MacKenzie doing this?<eos> Because she thought it would be awful.<eos> That's not really that bad.<eos> Oh honey. I'm so sorry.<eos> You were right.<eos> I was being a hypocrite.<eos> And my first insight about the cheer mums was right too.<eos> They are nasty, horrible people.

Really?<eos> Okay, Bean, well, what's seven plus nine?<eos> Seventy-nine.<eos> Is he a little boy or a computer?<eos> 'Cause I can't figure it out.<eos> Don't destroy his confidence.<eos> Happy summer, everybody.<eos> Okay, you sure you want to go with those boots, honey?<eos> I know you bedazzled them yourself.<eos> I'm just wondering if they'll attract too much attention, you know, from outer space.
The Jew beholds his tormentor dressed in the vestments of his own ancient culture.<eos> Everything bears a strange familiarity.<eos> But the fit is always poor and the hands are always dripping blood.<eos> That coat... didn't that belong to Uncle Chaim?<eos> What about the shoes?<eos> Enough.<eos> I see your look.<eos> No more philosophy.<eos> The stones themselves have their own view of things.<eos> Perhaps they're not so silent as you think.

Probably, yeah.<eos> I have to say that for a girl who liked girls, she took an extraordinary interest in the male member.<eos> She sucked on it so hard. Finally corrected my vision.<eos> She left me for this good-looking black woman.<eos> Had a boyfriend, played for the Oilers.<eos> Nice chap, nice chap.<eos> We met once for drinks at this club in Dallas to discuss our mutual plight.<eos> He was taking it rather poorly, I have to say.<eos> Women do better, don't they?<eos> Maybe they have more practice at it.
Of course, anybody who thinks he's the smartest is on his way to the slam.<eos> Would that be me?<eos> Nah, nah.<eos> Although, I have to say that I always thought a law degree was a license to steal and that you, for one, hadn't really capitalized on it.<eos> Yeah, well, you're not the straight dude people think, though, are you?<eos> I guess not.<eos> I don't mean the caper, I mean you.<eos> Women like you.<eos> All right.<eos> Do you know what they like about you?

Women like you.<eos> All right.<eos> Do you know what they like about you?<eos> I'm a good fuck?<eos> Right!<eos> No, they can sniff out the moral dilemma.<eos> The paradox.<eos> "Moral dilemma."<eos> Yeah, they're drawn to it. Not sure why.<eos> Maybe it's just that, lacking any moral sense themselves, they're fascinated by it in men.

I never knew my parents.<eos> They were thrown out of a helicopter into the Atlantic Ocean when I was three.<eos> Listen... you don't have to do the whole forgiveness thing.<eos> All you have to do is listen.<eos> To the sins.<eos> Women tell you about sex, don't they?<eos> I can't talk about that. Mm...<eos> Yeah, but every woman who goes to confess tells you that she's an adulterer or fornicator or something, or why else would she be there?<eos> So you must have a very unusual picture of women.<eos> You must think that they're just having sex all the time,
I know.<eos> Life is being in bed with you.<eos> Everything else is just waiting.<eos> I love you very much.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> Good night.<eos> Good night.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Women have funny ideas about sex.<eos> They're supposed to be so modest. Yeah.

Too brown.<eos> Mary!<eos> No.<eos> She's gone.<eos> Two girls in earlier tonight.<eos> One of them the prettiest girl in the world.<eos> The other one like a sort of nice prostitute.<eos> Did you get their names?<eos> Yes.<eos> They left a while ago.
No.<eos> She's gone.<eos> Two girls in earlier tonight.<eos> One of them the prettiest girl in the world.<eos> The other one like a sort of nice prostitute.<eos> Did you get their names?<eos> Yes.<eos> They left a while ago.<eos> Let's see.<eos> No, I'm afraid they were walk-ins and it appears they paid by cash.
I guess it is.<eos> Although it's not as sexy as reading.<eos> Sitting there in an office, in a little chair reading.<eos> Okay, stop.<eos> Just wait right there, mister, because a lot of books get submitted to my publisher.<eos> So it's an immense responsibility.<eos> I bet it is.<eos> But when you do normal reading, is it ruined because it's your job?<eos> You know, like prostitutes?<eos> I always worry that when they stop being prostitutes that they can't enjoy sex any more.
It would be nice.<eos> I'm really trying. I'm really trying.<eos> Get down low.<eos> Total defeat.<eos> I'm tired.<eos> Thanks, Dad.<eos> So I'm almost up-to-date with my story.<eos> As all families do, we got used to life after death.<eos> And it was still fine.<eos> And things settled back into their traditional rhythms season after season, and are much as they have always been.
There's nowhere else down here.<eos> They're early.<eos> I told you they were coming!<eos> You'll have to go upstairs, while they're arriving, we don't own upstairs, but it's the only place!<eos> I want to help you, of course, but it's too difficult! Really! It is!<eos> To the right there Louis! Right!<eos> Just wait!<eos> These people are waiting...<eos> For a taxi.<eos> Yes, for a, for a taxi, and just wanted to watch while they're waiting.
- You used to do that all the time. - Do what?<eos> It was like "Rimbaud wrote this by 17 ."<eos> Oh, yeah, definitely.<eos> Balzac wrote a book before breakfast, so, what am I doing?<eos> - Women don't think that way as much.<eos> - You don't think so? No.<eos> We have much less to compare ourselves to maybe.<eos> Women who achieve anything, first time you hear about them, they're in their 50s.<eos> It was so hard for them to get any recognitions before then.<eos> They struggled for 30 years or they raised kids... And were stranded at home before they could finally do what they want.
But what do you think? Is there any way that you could be happy in the U.S.?<eos> Is that just out of the realm of possibility? That you could find a comparable job?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Are you kidding? - No.<eos> Why am I the one that have to make the compromises? - Don't be so dramatic.<eos> Okay? - It should be...<eos> Moving to Chicago is pretty fucking dramatic for me.<eos> I'm not saying we should move. I just wanna talk about it.<eos> Can you be my friend for two seconds so we can talk? - Two seconds.<eos> Remember that time you were late to pick the girls up... And you were so stressed out because they were wondering what happened?
And take good care of him.<eos> Don't be ashamed.<eos> It is important that you depend on me to access.<eos> It is also important that you understand it and fix it.<eos> That is what cures you.<eos> If only I knew...<eos> Is there anything that suggests childhood?<eos> Well, there are things that happened when I was real small... that no one knows about.<eos> There were two girls that lived nearby.<eos> They were sisters.
Why be afraid to tell me?<eos> Alcohol has nothing to do with my headaches.<eos> Hell, maybe I'm just plain crazy...<eos> - You never were crazy.<eos> Then why am I in this ward?<eos> You know, on the reservation we have an "Indian agent" to tell us what to do.<eos> I have lived all my life under that shit.<eos> Then I come here, to the Winter Hospital, and it's even worse.<eos> I got to get away from all that.<eos> If a man keeps on taking these things, as time goes on, they pile up.
Between you two, what would I have to fear?<eos> I can't, his Majesty sent for me at Versailles.<eos> Well, if his Majesty sent for you...<eos> And you, Lastire? Who has sent for you?<eos> Escort her, Chevalier.<eos> You're of no use to me, you just have to... make sure your master doesn't find out.<eos> Upon reflection, this doesn't seem to be a contradiction of my duties.<eos> I have bad news, Marquis.<eos> The gangs have blocked off the roads leading to Versailles.<eos> They have sticks and stones for weapons, some even have a few nasty-looking muskets.
We know that the valet, Provence, has returned to Saint-Florentin House.<eos> As for the other two, Lady Gouet and Sir Missery, they seem to have left together, arm in arm, supporting each other, to a destination we should hasten to discover.<eos> It also seems they want to talk to you.<eos> Come here...<eos> Much like your world, Commissioner, the world of gallantry has its own rules and customs.<eos> We detest and warn against certain deviations.<eos> What kinds of deviations, my Lady?<eos> You won't see any useless compassion here.<eos> The girls are, shall we say, the base of our business.<eos> If they go missing or are damaged, we're in trouble.
I can assure you, this is a plot that looks to act against you.<eos> Your downfall could be imminent.<eos> Who took her?<eos> Your son-in-law, of sorts.<eos> Your illegitimate son-in-law.<eos> What can you tell me about the Marquis of Chambonas?<eos> You need to stay away from him.<eos> That man is most poisonous.<eos> He has killers in his employ, keep your distance.<eos> His protections are as hidden as they are indeed formidable.
Well, my condolences to him.<eos> I wonder how long it will take him to curse his lineage.<eos> As a bastard, your rank within the social order has been rigidly defined.<eos> You should endeavor to remain within it.<eos> Stay away from the Medicis, Leonardo.<eos> - I'll not warn you again.<eos> - I'll wager you will.<eos> Why do you have to make this so difficult?<eos> It's my nature!<eos> I see things as they are, not as they might be.
Yeah, I I should do that.<eos> Thank you for everything.<eos> Sure.<eos> Your chariot.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - See you tomorrow.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Get good rest.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> These keys, are they your friend's?
Great job.<eos> Places, everyone, for the top.<eos> Let's run the whole shebang. No stopping. How'd it go?<eos> I cut it.<eos> I know that was hard.<eos> Yes, it was.<eos> But it was also right.<eos> I need you to take another pass on the Gladys scenes.<eos> What?<eos> I know how much they mean to you, but I need them to be a little more focused.
How do you pass the time?<eos> I read!<eos> Do you really want to come between me and my pay day?<eos> You really want to call my best friend a pay day?<eos> Go, Selk!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Oh, you're brave, I'll give you that.<eos> Do you know what happens to brave little girls?<eos> No, neither do I.<eos> They don't live long enough to tell their tales.
Why don't ya come back in the morning and I'll have it for ya.<eos> Who do we have left?<eos> Just Stu?<eos> - That's it.<eos> Out fixing' the fence by the Flats.<eos> So, the banker and the store owner bullets are of identical composition.<eos> - They're 97% lead and 3% tin.<eos> Standard factory made, which is what I expected.<eos> But here's where it takes an interesting turn, Levi and Josie bullets are also of identical composition to one another.<eos> But they're 95 % lead and peculiarly 5% zinc, leading me to believe these bullets were not factory made, but were home made.
Yes, Well, your first problem is that Marie placed an impenetrable lock on the crypt.<eos> It's, uh...<eos> It's rather curious, actually.<eos> Anyone who tried to get through wound up flayed alive, so unless you know a good locksmith...<eos> Well, we really don't have problems with locks.<eos> We got a bitchin' set of tools.<eos> It's actually not the locks that I'm worried about.<eos> It's the catacombs under Paris.<eos> Yes, your second problem.<eos> They're notoriously difficult to navigate.
Relax?<eos> I can't relax!<eos> There's ghosts everywhere! It's like we're already dead!<eos> No, it's not!<eos> No, it's not.<eos> This is nothing like being dead.<eos> I know.<eos> I have seen it.<eos> I have seen where these things exist.<eos> They want what you have.

No, it's not!<eos> No, it's not.<eos> This is nothing like being dead.<eos> I know.<eos> I have seen it.<eos> I have seen where these things exist.<eos> They want what you have.<eos> Life.<eos> But they have no power over you.<eos> All you have to do is ignore them, and they will go away.
Hayley, come back here!<eos> I better walk you to your room just in case.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you-- do you want to come and hang out for a little bit or is--is that awkward?<eos> Come on, girlfriend.<eos> Who's going to worry about me?<eos> Okay.<eos> You shouldn't look at that.<eos> Yeah, well, I try not to, but... This guy has written, like, half a fucking novel about how I don't have any talent left.<eos> The new songs are too sentimental, and they don't have any edge.
Do you urinate, Hank?<eos> Do you defecate?<eos> There are elements in the human body that need to take flight.<eos> Ejaculate's just one of them.<eos> Right, that's what masturbation is for.<eos> Ew, no.<eos> Masturbation?<eos> Masturbation's for the poor, the downtrodden, the silent unfuckables.<eos> I walk down the street and women present themselves.<eos> They want to extract my fluids.
Masturbation's for the poor, the downtrodden, the silent unfuckables.<eos> I walk down the street and women present themselves.<eos> They want to extract my fluids.<eos> It's an honor and a privilege, Hank.<eos> What--what sort of asshole would refuse such a kindness?<eos> - What about your old lady?<eos> - What about her?<eos> What about her needs?<eos> Wives are different.<eos> They don't rub themselves raw like we do.
You should see the girls who work the factory floor.<eos> They actually make something that matters!
You liked me better all Confucius and chop suey?<eos> I sure put my foot in it upstairs.<eos> I really know nothing about China.<eos> China's been fighting the Japanese for the last ten years.<eos> For us, their first hit was just a few months back, in Pearl Harbour.<eos> And Hong Kong, a lot of our men died there.<eos> Even more are prisoners of war.<eos> Well, if they treat the Canadians like they do the Chinese, those prisoners will have a hard time surviving, Miss Witham.<eos> But there are international laws.<eos> Laws mean nothing if they're not observed.
Oh, I don't need a rescue.<eos> Ivan's great.<eos> Really?<eos> You mean that?<eos> Betty, aren't you leading him on?<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> You're telling me your heart's in this?<eos> This is what girls do.<eos> They date boys.<eos> And don't get arrested, and they keep their jobs and don't have the whole bloody world thinking they're "deviant freaks."
I told you I'd deliver on ten years of assholes.<eos> I think I did a pretty good job.<eos> A little bit too convincing at times.<eos> Was it?<eos> That doesn't surprise me.<eos> When you've been out there as long as I have, you learn to play the game.<eos> Oh, I'd be out there, laying my rap. I'd have girls literally thinking I was an astronomer.<eos> I'd be pointing out constellations and harvest moons.<eos> "Oh, there's Pluto!"<eos> Then they'd start to fact check you with the Internet.
Hello.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'll have the same.<eos> Ah, weddings!<eos> Ah, weddings.<eos> Natalie was after we split.<eos> Minutes. But well done for trying.<eos> I heard the new one legged it.<eos> Michaela and I have parted company, yes.<eos> These young women, they just can't make up their minds, can they?
Well, they'll be outgunned.<eos> With 10 guns?<eos> Are you certain?<eos> We're casting more muskets.<eos> I promise you, you'll never have to fire them.<eos> Sometimes... when all your enemy knows is killing... a simple deception can suffice.<eos> Riario is far more clever than you think, da Vinci.<eos> Your wit won't get us out of this one.<eos> Only your weapons will.<eos> And I promise you, they will fire.
We dare not reject Christ's warriors in our hour of need.<eos> - Nephew.<eos> - Your Grace.<eos> How goes the business at the Convent?<eos> I fear the casualties mount.<eos> The Lord often requires sacrifice.<eos> The Medicis crossed the Lord, refusing to appoint our Archbishop in Pisa, employing a war engineer.<eos> It is God's will to break Lorenzo and all who support him. With the possible exception of da Vinci, I agree with you.<eos> Lucrezia Donati has him tied up between her thighs, his alliance with the Medicis is a fragile one.<eos> Those weapons he makes, they could all be ours.
Mother?<eos> Mother?<eos> Da Vinci...<eos> can you hear me?<eos> I think he's starting to respond.<eos> Maestro... are you alright?<eos> You kept stirring and crying out.<eos> Vanessa's lips.<eos> Vanessa's lips...<eos> they bore the poison.
- I'll confiscate them.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> By all means.<eos> Demonstrate to everyone that I can terrify you with a leaf.<eos> Perhaps I can dig an escape tunnel.<eos> Your tunneling days are over, sodomite.<eos> Deviance is in the eye of the beholder.<eos> Plants practice a form of it.<eos> Pollination.<eos> They seduce bees, bats, into transporting their seed.

Plants have devised a way to exploit it.<eos> Cos normal leaves, they have weak reflections.<eos> But these concave petals, they... ..they reflect sound over a much larger area.<eos> Like a cave.<eos> And it draws the bats in.<eos> It's a consensual arrangement.<eos> The bats get nectar and the flowers get sex.<eos> Insanity is, of course, another defense at our disposal.<eos> You are demented if you think these charges will simply vanish.<eos> They must.

If I'd produced this at the trial, no amount of sophistry would have saved you.<eos> But I wanted to see you exposed, not killed.<eos> Why?<eos> What you have with women isn't love.<eos> You're with them out of fear.<eos> I'm curious by nature.<eos> Desire...<eos> It's not as simple as one sex or the other.<eos> I'm sorry I hurt you.<eos> My experiments and curiosities, they're...

Dinner awaits.<eos> How are we supposed to free the captive from a place like this?<eos> If I knew that, I'd be Da Vinci.<eos> You've dropped some change.<eos> Of course, you'll have noticed the money.<eos> The Sultanis - a base currency... ..for the heathen ruler of the east.<eos> You see, this is how I allow my soldiers to prove their loyalty to me.<eos> I toss these Sultanis on the ground before them.<eos> And, do you know, the coins are never, ever touched?<eos> It's just they've fallen quite randomly, you'd really notice if one was gone?
- Let's see if this works.<eos> Are we okay?<eos> - You and me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Are we, like, less close now?<eos> Of course we're not less close.<eos> I mean, you moved out.<eos> So when two people don't live together anymore, they're obviously a little less close, but we're no less close than that.
And these.<eos> 67 pesos.<eos> It took me a while to find this place.<eos> You drink whisky, right?<eos> - I don't usually.<eos> - Get him a Blue Label.<eos> Actually, I would have loved to be a musician, but I have no musical ear.<eos> I guess the law allows me some control.<eos> It's a way of putting the world in order, even if it's only an illusion, isn't it?<eos> Things are just the way they are, but they could very well be different.
- Nothing.<eos> Wake up.<eos> - I'm awake.<eos> - I'm Joserra, your colleague.<eos> - Hello, Joserra. Listen, we're going to land.<eos> Wake the passengers.<eos> - Where are we landing?<eos> - In La Mancha, in an hour.<eos> See to these girls.<eos> - They'll want an explanation.
Did Ulloa tell you?<eos> - Was he drugged?<eos> - To the eyeballs.<eos> I know when a man wants the woman in me or the transvestite... and he wanted the woman!<eos> You've made me doubt, bitch!<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> - Where do you want to go?<eos> To your place.<eos> I swore that if we got out of this I'd go and live with you.<eos> Things are fine as they are.
I wanted to surprise you.<eos> - What is happening?<eos> - We're having a little party for you. A year is a great achievement.<eos> Where are you stupid man?<eos> - Have you remembered your passport?<eos> - Is this human trafficking?<eos> Would you force me to satisfy 25 truck drivers a day -<eos> - In a port in Belgium before I get it back?<eos> No, I do not.<eos> But it's a terrible situation for the women. I always think that they also began life to be somebody's baby.
How good is this, rollo?<eos> Especially because we're here together.<eos> Yes, while we're here in Uppsala let us enjoy and revel in every moment.<eos> (Water sloshes in bucket)<eos> Have you been here before, Helga?<eos> Helga:<eos> No.<eos> Do you know what happens here?<eos> I've heard some stories.<eos> Rollo: And they're all true.

It looks like rain.<eos> Come.<eos> Why have you come?<eos> I am frightened for my husband.<eos> Do you think your husband is in some kind of danger?<eos> I've had strange and disturbing dreams.<eos> What happens in your dreams?<eos> Dark shapes come to me at night.<eos> Monstrous forms.<eos> When I wake, they skulk in the shadows, shapeless, but no sooner am I asleep than they creep forward again.

I just don't have it figured out yet.<eos> That'll probably take some time-- figuring' things out.<eos> What is it?<eos> The place where I was had no windows.<eos> Just these thick walls surrounded by more thick walls.<eos> So, I never knew if it was rainin' or even heard the loudest thunder.<eos> It's so sad.<eos> Oh, it's-it's not as bad as it sounds, because I-I didn't sense things in a normal way.<eos> I didn't miss them.<eos> If-if I couldn't sense them, I-I-- they weren't real to me.
No.<eos> You know what no one wants to talk about.<eos> Hate.<eos> I know all about hate.<eos> It starts in your gut, deep down here, where it stirs and churns.<eos> And then it rises.<eos> Hate rises fast and volcanic.<eos> It erupts hot on the breath.<eos> Your eyes go wide with fire.<eos> You clench your teeth so hard you think they'll shatter.
You were seen talking to her.<eos> So what were you talking about?<eos> I'll wait outside.<eos> She came up to me after the performance.<eos> We had a drink together.<eos> Was she alone?<eos> She came alone.<eos> She didn't leave alone.<eos> I spent the night with her.<eos> These overprotected kids. One day or another, they want to experiment new things.
- So what's your type anyway, blondie?<eos> Well... it's nothing you'd see in a mirror.<eos> Poser.<eos> What you Gwai Lo want?<eos> Oh, great, now she's done it.<eos> She's agitated him.<eos> - Mr. Fang...<eos> - You are so beautiful...<eos> Yewberries are poisonous!<eos> They affect each kind of Fae differently!

Are they gone?<eos> (Sally screams)<eos> Or are they murdering Sally?<eos> Right, one tip about Betty and Veronica...<eos> Hey, since when is wearing hats inside a thing?<eos> You have to dress every moment like this is the outfit that you could die in.<eos> This what you're willing to die in?<eos> Stop, quiet.<eos> Listen, just please do not disperse the underwear bitches when I am in my room, ok?<eos> That's where they reset.
What?<eos> Run!<eos> - What am I supposed to do?<eos> - Run!<eos> That's it.<eos> Are you ok?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> I feel like this is where I should be.<eos> You know, I know the consequences were... (Chuckles)<eos> Well, they sucked!
It needs fixing or we're toast.<eos> So now would be a good time to use that big friendly button, right?<eos> Yeah, sorry, I should have had one built in.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Detour.<eos> The centre of the TARDIS.<eos> Shush!<eos> Something's in here.<eos> Those... things.<eos> They've followed us.

You're like one of the those guys who can't go out with a girl unless his mother approves.<eos> It's important to me you get along...<eos> What's that noise?<eos> We're right under the primary fuel cells.<eos> So?<eos> So?<eos> So what?<eos> So... so the fuel has spilled out.<eos> So the rods will be exposed.<eos> Means they'll cool...
We can't beat a Cyberman.<eos> The Imperium has to know what's happening.<eos> Like you said, the communicators are out.<eos> The only way you can report this now is to activate the bomb.<eos> Yes.<eos> And I forbid you to do that.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Why would you blow up a whole planet, and everybody on it, just to get rid of one Cyberman?<eos> We tried other ways.<eos> But they only work sometimes.
Water?<eos> Danelion greens?<eos> Ah, perhaps you' like to re-center yourself by meitating in the garens.<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> An you must be the honorable Pema.<eos> Please, accept these gifts.<eos> This is an ancient Airbener hea shaver we've refurbishe just for you.<eos> - Oh...okay. An Pema, these flowers once fille the mountainsie.<eos> Now they can brighten up your room.
All our Ripper suspects, Sir?<eos> High earners, very,<eos> I look for one in particular.<eos> Here.<eos> Here!<eos> What?<eos> Are you so desperate, Inspector, that you rake through all the suspects we ever knew?<eos> We have the man, in your cell.<eos> Those two missing girls' particulars, Sir.<eos> They were using the Lonely Hearts and all.
- Is it okay if Duncan can start?<eos> Please.<eos> Sure.<eos> Why?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I told you I don't do this.<eos> You don't do what? I mean, why are you here?<eos> If you don't do it, why are you here?<eos> I'm here because you asked me to be here.<eos> And if you want to... You want to know why things turned out like they did.
You, your lifestyle, your fake social work...<eos> Why can't you just be normal?<eos> Stop weeping, and don't ever lecture me again.<eos> I will never say a word to you again.<eos> She went back to Delhi.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Does Vasudha also think it's my fault?<eos> If I wouldn't have bought the monastery, someone else would have.<eos> Girls, I tell you.<eos> I wish they were all like you.
Colette's husband is a friend of Garnet's whose gallery is showing Jill's paintings.<eos> - The ones she won't show you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And I don't get it, you know?<eos> She always shows me her work first,<eos> Not that Garnet's a bad guy, if you're into rich guys with chiseled good looks who work out.<eos> "Hi, I'm Neil's ball sack." Oh!<eos> That's just wrong, man.<eos> I don't want your balls on my phone.<eos> If they say wise or hilarious things you do.
Well, it would be if you were one of those wrinkly old war horses, but you're not.<eos> So it's kind of hot.<eos> Well, I know it was a little extreme, but I have been looking for something... bigger than myself my whole life.<eos> And for a while, it was really nice.<eos> But I just couldn't live that way.<eos> Oh, I understand.<eos> The nunnery's loss is humanity's gain.<eos> The sisters caught me getting off once, which was hugely, hugely embarrassing.<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> - But... They told you not to make a habit of it.
Aw!<eos> Jesus...<eos> But I felt it.<eos> That actually hurt!<eos> Tom, what about you?<eos> The Wolf's gone.<eos> I can't find it.<eos> Hal, what's happening?<eos> Our curses came from the Devil.<eos> With him dead, properly dead, they've gone.
Claire, we made the decision to turn Remy down.<eos> No one forced you.<eos> I thought we were okay on this.<eos> You're right.<eos> Good night, Francis.<eos> This is Adam.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> Hi, Adam.<eos> It's me. I know it's late, but, well, I was really just calling to thank you again for the photographs.<eos> I'm sure they're gonna be a big hit at the auction.

My cousin, my family.<eos> There are strong ties.<eos> Though we see each other rarely.<eos> She and I are very different.<eos> I must tell you...<eos> I don't give a shit about your cousin.<eos> If your father and grandfather reject all that, it's because... we all do what we can to protect against memories.<eos> But thanks to the laws dictated to Moses on Mt. Sinai, we have remained a people.<eos> Those laws are sacred.<eos> Though nowadays they may seem trivial, they connect us, throughout the world.

He misses you, you know?<eos> Come on.<eos> - Wait! - What? !<eos> I want to walk.<eos> I need to walk!<eos> Sit down over here.<eos> Your hand.<eos> And yours.<eos> I'm recharging.<eos> The first quartz watches... You're too young. When you didn't wear them close to the skin for a while, they would stop.
Star Wars, Thumb Wars, wow, Storage Wars!<eos> Fine.<eos> You can't get in the fountain.<eos> - I'm taking that penny back.<eos> - I already told you, the pennies aren't wishes.<eos> You can't flip a wish.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> Your rules are ridiculous.<eos> They're Abed's rules.<eos> And they're awesome, and they always work.
I'll be right over.<eos> Are you sure this is gonna work?<eos> Guaranteed to work.<eos> It's an antic.<eos> Ahh!<eos> Not so fast, you two.<eos> - Get ready to run.<eos> - In these heels?<eos> Where'd you girls get those dresses?<eos> They're fabulous.

I don't actually want to date any of these guys.<eos> I'm trying to solve a murder.<eos> Helene?<eos> Lordan.<eos> Come on.<eos> This guy?<eos> He's a lame-chop slathered in fail sauce.<eos> Hey, did you get the flowers I sent?<eos> Yes, yes, um, I did.<eos> They were gorgeous.
[Sighs] I hate this.<eos> This is just-- this is just a terrible, horrible thing you're making me do, Helene.<eos> Mike, no one is making you do anyth--<eos> Yes, you are!<eos> Mike.<eos> Juliet's date from the Italian restaurant.<eos> Oh, yeah, I dated both of those girls that were killed.<eos> Yeah, they rejected me.<eos> They gave excuses why they weren't ready for a relationship, and then they turned around and they were totally interested in my, uh, [laughs] fictitious alter ego Mr. Possibilities, because he's good-looking, and he seems flawless.<eos> You see, women...don't want what they say they want.
And you're the same. [Gun cocks]<eos> All right, this was the meeting spot.<eos> Can't be far off.<eos> Let's split up!<eos> Remember our date at the restaurant?<eos> Remember what you told me?<eos> Do you remember how you told me that things were--what was it?<eos> What was it, Helene?<eos> They were too complicated?<eos> They were too complicated for you?
Plus, it's raining now.<eos> If I don't start smelling slow-roasting brisket in the next two minutes, we're turning around.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Shawn frigging Spencer?<eos> You really came.<eos> This is the boobs.<eos> Uh, Kate, favor.<eos> Wow, you look just like your picture on the blog spot.<eos> I thought it was a screen cap of Angelina Jolie in Original Sin.<eos> Shawn, who are these people, and why do they know your name?
[Thunder effects] KJAD's new after-dark talk.<eos> I'm your host, a player named Gus.<eos> Now sit back and chillax with me, as I take you on a funky ride.<eos> If you don't scream, well, I sure enough won't holler.<eos> [Chuckles] You feel me, White Chocolate?<eos> Seriously, you're gonna do "A Player Named Gus?"<eos> Man, you couldn't even stay awake doing this shtick in college!<eos> Miranda has a vision for me, Shawn.<eos> Yeah, you, standing naked, posing like Captain Morgan.<eos> She still believes I know women and how they operate and what it means to touch someone.
The meats and cheeses, they're not gonna touch.<eos> Touch, right.<eos> They're not gonna touch.<eos> They're not gonna touch. Stay here, I'll be right back.<eos> Holy living--<eos> Yeah. Dude, I think you might have actually undersold this thing.<eos> - You didn't kill this guy, right?<eos> - No! All right, well, you've got innocence on your side.<eos> - What?<eos> - I think we should call the police and let the chips fall where they may.
♪ let your color shine [Cell phone chimes] - oh, crap, Todd.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Morning.<eos> Coffee?<eos> - You didn't have to do that.<eos> - I know.<eos> Just 'cause we've broken up doesn't mean I'm not a human being with regular feelings about coffee. Cheers.<eos> Oh, I ironed your ties, by the way.<eos> They're on the ironing board.
I have medicine here for Mr. Seward with instructions on how he must take it.<eos> I'm sorry, but you cannot see him now.<eos> My sister and his nurse are endeavoring to compose my father to sleep now.<eos> - But I must.<eos> Dr. Verdi's orders.<eos> - Wait. Wait.<eos> As I thought and as I said it's not worthwhile to talk about this any further.<eos> Miss Mary Meredith!<eos> What will Miss Harris think of my hanging on to you so?<eos> ...and mothers would go away from a fellow when they found that out, but you don't valley fortune.
What about anthony pizzoli?<eos> Who?<eos> Nut-nut!<eos> The 17 year old down the hall!<eos> I'm not into younger guys.<eos> Curfews, body sprays, doodles of fighter jets... now the neighbors hate us.<eos> The neighbors hate us now.<eos> You know who I hate?<eos> Single moms.<eos> They make such a big deal about it.
Money ...<eos> Sex ...<eos> Power ... on this track you can get it all.<eos> When you dance here the feeling is indescribable ...<eos> and you become addicted.<eos> It's hard to get a seat.<eos> To keep the ...<eos> It is even harder.<eos> A wrong bevægelse, and you can lose everything.<eos> Some girls learn the on the hard way, and they go out.
Do you know how long these cable cars have been here?<eos> I don't know, Theosophist.<eos> Thousands and thousands and thousands of years.<eos> You don't know where they come from nor where they go, but you can take one of their rocks and keep it like a treasure. Come.<eos> Those cars are like our bodies which carry our souls.<eos> The soul is a treasure, the god within us.<eos> I'm going to give you a present.<eos> See these three medals?<eos> They think they're separate.<eos> Melt them down in an oven, and they will turn into a single drop.
You'll look a hero.<eos> I will if you give me the black man's shoes.<eos> What black man?<eos> What shoes?<eos> The red shoes of the dummy in the window.<eos> That automaton was very expensive.<eos> It has to be elegant.<eos> What will people say if it's barefoot?<eos> Put him in my shoes.<eos> - They're ugly!
Family matters only.<eos> Any political talk, and I'll terminate the visit.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Yes, I'm all right.<eos> Tell me about you.<eos> I'm under a banning order.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> Our friends are helping me.<eos> The girls send their love.<eos> They want to see you.
Yes, I'm all right.<eos> Tell me about you.<eos> I'm under a banning order.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> Our friends are helping me.<eos> The girls send their love.<eos> They want to see you.<eos> I think of them every day.<eos> You must tell them I love them.<eos> They're not allowed visits until they're 16.
From there, you can change E.Q., add effects, change the levels.<eos> And that goes into the tape machine, where it's recorded.<eos> This board, if you put a fader up and turn the mike pre up, and somebody hits a tom-tom or a snare drum, it sounds great.<eos> If you turn the mike pre up too loud and it distorts, it still sounds great.<eos> That's analog.<eos> It's how it sounds.<eos> Especially Neve's, you know.<eos> I mean, everything is just better.<eos> The human voice sounds better.<eos> When you got harmonies going together, they kind of meld together.
They needed him to win the war.<eos> This is our war, Tom.<eos> It's a human war.<eos> And the minute we start forgetting that, the minute we start depending on somebody else to do this work for us, we're on a bad road -- and you're never gonna get me to change my mind on that.<eos> And if I could?<eos> What -- I don't understand.<eos> Come with me.<eos> What you doing over there?<eos> I'm looking for your boots.<eos> They were right here.

Where do we set these charges, Doc?<eos> There and... There... And there.<eos> That could bring down the building without rupturing the containment vessel.<eos> "Could"? We need to do a hell of a lot better than "could."<eos> Call it a high order of probability, then, if it makes you happy.<eos> All right, Anthony, set the charges.<eos> The control room should be that way.<eos> Let's go turn the reactor off.<eos> My glasses!<eos> They're broken!
Her phone rang in the closet.<eos> He went to look and found her stuffed inside, dead.<eos> Now one possibility is that the killer was still with her when the boyfriend came home and disturbed him.<eos> So he shoved her in the cupboard and fled.<eos> I just don't buy it.<eos> This would account for the three months between this murder and the killing of Alice Monroe.<eos> It didn't go as planned with... with Gallagher and it spooked him.<eos> And so when he struck again he made sure that he did it right.<eos> Two professional women in their early 30s, killed in their own homes by strangulation.<eos> I mean, look, they could be sisters.
I already have the bodies.<eos> I want you to tell me where the heads are.<eos> What heads?<eos> I'm asking you for the last time.<eos> Where did you hide them?<eos> Stop!<eos> I have no idea!<eos> You're insane!<eos> - You have to stop this insanity!<eos> - I'll stop... once you tell me where they are.
It wasn't me.<eos> It wasn't me!<eos> You have to stop him!<eos> Sorry, but I'd like to know how the story ends.<eos> Where was I?<eos> He sedated the little girls.<eos> Right.<eos> - Bravo.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> So after violating every hole in their bodies... he'd wait until they woke up... and then their real nightmare began.
So after violating every hole in their bodies... he'd wait until they woke up... and then their real nightmare began.<eos> The sick maniac would take the little angels' hands... and break all their fingers, one by one. The poor girls would faint from the pain.<eos> And what did the sadist do then?<eos> Wait for them to wake up?<eos> Have you read this story?<eos> Do you want to take over?<eos> What?<eos> No, you're doing a great job.<eos> Thanks.<eos> When they'd regain consciousness... he'd take off their shoes and socks... and rip their toenails off their delicate feet.
I know.<eos> I was surprised, too.<eos> I think she's the last one.<eos> Well, that was almost as humiliating as my fourth divorce.<eos> Never marry a Russian prostitute with a history.<eos> You know what?<eos> Never marry a prostitute.<eos> So, we lost, sir?<eos> No, Neal, I'm humiliated by our victory.<eos> I hope you guys tried the coconut shrimp, 'cause they are diggity-dunzo.
You wanna know how many times I came?<eos> I honestly don't care whether you win.<eos> But if you do, work with me.<eos> How often did you solicit prostitutes in D.C.?<eos> Once every two or three months.<eos> Sometimes more frequently, sometimes less.<eos> Do you have reason to believe any of them were underage?<eos> Jesus! No.<eos> Look, they were mostly high-end.<eos> That doesn't mean they were 18.
Censor information.<eos> They censor any means of individual expression.<eos> And it's important to remember this, that this is a pattern that repeats itself throughout history.<eos> Okay.<eos> See you next week.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> How are you?<eos> I'm good.<eos> See, every dictatorship, there's only one obsession and that's control, they want to have control over the people.
See you next week.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> How are you?<eos> I'm good.<eos> See, every dictatorship, there's only one obsession and that's control, they want to have control over the people.<eos> In ancient Rome, they gave bread and circuses, they kept the populace busy with entertainment.<eos> In other dictatorships, they have other strategies.<eos> To limit information, to limit ideas and knowledge.<eos> How do they do that?
That's genius.<eos> Evil genius.<eos> Taking advantage of women who can't afford to lose their jobs?<eos> - It's sick.<eos> - Then quit.<eos> I need the job. Overtime.<eos> Benefits.<eos> But eventually, they're all gonna realize I'm not carrying my share of the load.<eos> Literally.<eos> Maybe I can figure out a way to make 'em all stop before they realize I'm getting a free ride.
I'm not a girl?<eos> Lip.<eos> Debbie?<eos> It wasn't real.<eos> It was ketchup.<eos> They did it in front of everyone!<eos> - Who?<eos> - The girls at the pool.<eos> Debs.<eos> They're pretty and boys notice them.
Lip.<eos> Debbie?<eos> It wasn't real.<eos> It was ketchup.<eos> They did it in front of everyone!<eos> - Who?<eos> - The girls at the pool.<eos> Debs.<eos> They're pretty and boys notice them.<eos> Well, they won't be pretty for long.

The guy on the phone!<eos> What does he want?<eos> - Easy, easy, man.<eos> All right? - Who is he?<eos> Uh, I have no idea what you're talking about, man.<eos> He said the answers would be here.<eos> They got to be here.<eos> Tommy, get up. - Shut up.<eos> - Get him out of here.<eos> - They got to be here. Where are they?
Bad luck.<eos> I got caught in the crossfire of a local Mafia feud.<eos> They were trying to shoot a couple who was testifying against the family, and I don't know if they no see me or they just think I'm a statue, but I got shot 19 times.<eos> 19 times seems excessive.<eos> They say it's still a record in that part of Italy, huh?<eos> - Not bad.<eos> - For Italy, that is something.<eos> Put that on your Facebook page.<eos> They take me back to a local hospital. And there, the good sisters save my life.<eos> They suck the 19 bullets out of my body with their mouths.
- Where's she at?<eos> In the kitchen eating pizza salad with my sister-in-law and my black friend and neighbour, F'resnel.<eos> You don't have to be that specific with us, sir!<eos> Mind if we ask her a couple questions?<eos> Could I say no?<eos> Yeah, but then we come back with a warrant and you better be lawyered up, Gregory Hines.<eos> The dancer guy?<eos> - I don't know why I said that.<eos> - I don't either.<eos> Folks, we need you to look at some photographs, but I will warn you, they are a little bit graphic.

I apologise.<eos> Yeah, they're graphic.
They're lazy.<eos> They're entitled.<eos> They think just by putting it in their mouth, that's all they need to do, but you and I know<eos> - that's just the beginning.<eos> - Right.<eos> I know how to get shit done.<eos> Now your cock's on the verge of making a decision, Hank.<eos> What's it gonna be?<eos> - Everything okay in here?<eos> - Things are not as they seem.
You do seem to relish speed in all things, including motor cars?<eos> Well... Luckily, our wise backer, Mr Musker, has complete confidence in our business and our speed.<eos> And I take it you have complete confidence in him as well?<eos> There's the question of recent press, Mr Selfridge.<eos> Rather a lot of it.<eos> Not all favourable, it has to be said.<eos> Investors might be wary now.<eos> You Americans have a reputation for being reckless and -<eos> Let's just hit the nail on the head, shall we, gentlemen?<eos> You can't have a problem with our business proposals because they make sense.
This one's pretty, don't you think?<eos> I'm not sure about the train.<eos> You must have a train!<eos> And I have to get used to them.<eos> When I eventually get presented, the train has to be no less than three yards in length from the shoulders.<eos> It sounds rather ornate.<eos> It's tradition.<eos> For you, Mrs Selfridge.<eos> Oh!<eos> White roses, they are so beautiful!
The house creaks, it's normal.<eos> She's forgotten what it's like living in the country.<eos> But, if she doesn't settle, then we'll have to move.<eos> Even if it means going back into town.<eos> After only one month now, it's a bit of shame, but, still...<eos> And we're gonna have to do her bedroom up again.<eos> Let her choose everything this time.<eos> Maybe she'll feel better then.<eos> And I've cut the branches down outside her window.<eos> They were casting shadows over the wall.
I know her not, though she is of my mind.<eos> Then shall I ask my Sergeant to return her, so I may remind you both of the facts here?<eos> That this condemned boy was brought to you beaten blue by his captor?<eos> No, Mr Eagles.<eos> That the victim's belongings were about him, that five men saw him depart the scene at some speed soon after...<eos> Though none saw the act... that this boy is no stranger to violence.<eos> And that finally, when presented with the opportunity, he even now refuses to deny it.<eos> Lusk and his hamheads have served an entire hymnal of guilt and the world has sung from it.<eos> Mr Reid, you are no stranger to the horrors of our city.<eos> But have they poisoned your heart so completely that you truly believe this boy - this boy alone... capable of the savagery brought down on that man?
- Is that so? - Yeah.<eos> Oh, yes, yes, for a year or two Hal became quite obsessed with thoroughbreds.<eos> So, what are you gonna study in college?<eos> Let me guess.<eos> A nurse.<eos> Is that how I impress you? - A nurse?<eos> - You got something against nurses?<eos> - My sister's a nurse.<eos> - Nurses are very hot to go to bed with.<eos> They have extensive knowledge of how the human body works.

Dessert.<eos> You lose!<eos> Very clever.<eos> We win!<eos> I've been looking for you for three days.<eos> I didn't think you were the type to make me seek you out.<eos> You're teaching me a lesson, right?<eos> You're hardly in a position to do so.<eos> I read it in Violette's book.<eos> American researchers say that because women stayed in the caves, they invented rock painting.

Robbie?<eos> Where's Edgar?<eos> He left.<eos> Robbie, you do understand that me, you, and mom and dad aren't alive anymore... this isn't the real world?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> When did you figure that out?<eos> This morning...<eos> After I found my glasses.<eos> Your glasses?<eos> They were under my pillow.
You got it.<eos> Why didn't she tell me what she saw in my palm?<eos> 'Cause it doesn't work like that.<eos> Oh, I didn't realize I had to grease your whore cousin like the rest of the rubes.<eos> Whore as in, like, literal description.<eos> I'm a fucking feminist.<eos> What you want isn't for sale. Destiny doesn't trade real magic for money.<eos> She trades everything else.<eos> It's not the same.<eos> Women do what they do.

Who's your favorite artist?<eos> Probably Renae Taylor.<eos> Yeah, I see a little Renae in you.<eos> If things go well, maybe you'll open up for her.<eos> No way.<eos> If things go really well, she'll open up for you.<eos> Shut up.<eos> It wasn't that long ago that Justin Bieber was opening up for Taylor Swift.<eos> I'm just saying, it happens.<eos> So your other songs, they're not religious, right?

Oh, yeah.<eos> Totally.<eos> I like to get to know a person before I think about traveling with them.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I read your WideSpin spread.<eos> Sally's so convincing, it's hysterical.<eos> Yeah, yeah, she's cool.<eos> I loved the flowers.<eos> Who's idea was that?<eos> Uh, they were from Jay.
How are you?<eos> Good.<eos> You were not at your desk, so I came here.<eos> You were reading in the canteen, I didn't want to bother you.<eos> Your meal exhales a delicious aroma.<eos> I tasted the food just by smelling it!<eos> Your wife... has magic in her hands.<eos> My wife is dead.<eos> Dear Ila, the salt was fine today.<eos> The chilly was a bit on a higher side. But I had two bananas after lunch, they help to extinguish the fire in my mouth.
My mother loves old serials.<eos> Small , I watched for hours.<eos> I wanted to tell you something.<eos> Each cigarette smoke, it is 5 min of life and less.<eos> My father has lung cancer.<eos> When he suffers too, he said he would have to smoke more for not to deal with this pain.<eos> Don't blame me.<eos> Yes, Auntie?<eos> You have my carrots?<eos> They are there.

The 5000 should be sufficient for this month.<eos> Next month else be found.<eos> You wanna see it?<eos> I wake up?<eos> It's late, we must go back.<eos> Okay.<eos> Dear Ila,<eos> You will not believe what happened to me yesterday.<eos> The evening, on my way to the station with Shaikh, my colleague, the urge took me look at the paintings of an artist.<eos> They are all identical.
Crap!<eos> Goddammit!<eos> Primeval New World 01x11 The Inquisition Original Air Date February 5, 2013<eos> Lieutenant Leeds, you're to come with us.<eos> Colonel.<eos> Would you, uh, take a seat, lieutenant?<eos> Good.<eos> So, yesterday, an escaped specimen from the Project Magnet research facility killed two soldiers under my command.<eos> Sir, are the handcuffs really necessary?<eos> They're a little uncomfortable.
Whoever's hurting the most gets to be an asshole?<eos> You're working for them now.<eos> So yeah, you're helping, but we all know that comes with a price tag.<eos> You want to blame me?<eos> That's fine, I can take it.<eos> But you know what I blame?<eos> The anomalies.<eos> They're what's wrong with this picture.<eos> They're what's tearing us apart.<eos> Mac, unless we start working together, they're what's going to kill us all.
She's right.<eos> Sort the guns out later.<eos> Mate, I'm supposed to get you home safe, not the other way around.<eos> Just let me do my job properly, all right?<eos> Fine.<eos> Looks like I might be seeing you again, then.<eos> I hope so.<eos> Make sure the guns get to Evan Cross.<eos> He'll know what to do with them.<eos> They're in good hands.

So, tell me about Broadchurch.<eos> OK. It's the only town for about 20 miles.<eos> There's one road in, one road out.<eos> Market twice weekly...<eos> Yeah, I've got all that.<eos> Who lives here?<eos> Well, a lot have been here all their lives, generations.<eos> Some of them haven't even been 50 miles outside of town.<eos> And then there's the incomers.<eos> Young families, left cities when they had babies, came here for the schools and the sea.
It should be impossible.<eos> It is.<eos> I can't tell you what I'm doing or why.<eos> This is my new phone number.<eos> Please don't tell anyone.<eos> This is it.<eos> Thank you for walking me home.<eos> I could have walked with you forever.<eos> Why have I never met you before?<eos> Things happen when they must.
Look, Steve.<eos> You didn't want to be involved back when we started this thing, and that was fine by me.<eos> I just wanted you to cut the checks.<eos> Be involved, just don't tum Macintosh into a measure of revenge for you.<eos> Everyone knows about your fallout with Team Lisa.<eos> So trust me when I say, we're doing fine.<eos> Okay, Jef.<eos> Let's get a couple things straight.<eos> We don't do fine.<eos> And we don't accept things the way that they are, and we don't stop innovating.
You know, Talia Concept loves to provoke.<eos> Don't bother, there are more important things than provoking me.<eos> And this habit of speaking in the third person is unbearable.<eos> What are you reading?<eos> I don't need to read, I live on vibrations, extra-sensory ones.<eos> Extra-sensoriality aside, what do you mean by vibrations?<eos> The poetry of vibrations cannot be described with the vulgarity of words.<eos> Well, try at least.<eos> I'm an artist, I don't need to explain jack shit.<eos> So I'll write: "Lives on vibrations, but she doesn't know what they are."
You never leave Rome.<eos> Go to Giglio to do that report on the Concordia I've asked you to do 50 times.<eos> Re-heated rice is always tastier than freshly cooked rice.<eos> The old is better than the new.<eos> Plans tonight, chèrie?<eos> As the great De Blasi, my predecessor, said:<eos> "Tonight I'll do two things, eat soup and have a shag."<eos> Two things that contradict each other.<eos> That's what I'd say too, and she'd reply, in a serious tone:<eos> "No, Dadina, they don't, because they're both hot."
- Did you have to call her Ramona?<eos> You artists are all the same!<eos> I tell you I have a daughter and you complain about her name!<eos> What's wrong with "Ramona"?<eos> Nothing, it's a name that implies ambitions...<eos> There's my daughter, you see?<eos> She makes me so mad, I've told her a million times!<eos> You're too old for this!<eos> Now these hot young Polish girls rule the scene.<eos> They're experts at turning tricks.
Travis is still in command...<eos> Travis got himself shot and captured, he can't lead from a prison.<eos> So actually yes, that does make me ranking officer, do you have a problem with that Garza?<eos> Get me all the intel you can on Travis.<eos> Security, anyone we have on the inside, everything.<eos> Okay, so according to forensics, the kill shot came from approximately a 35-degree angle in this direction right here.<eos> Now the shooter could've been anywhere from 100 to 1,000 meters depending on their skill.<eos> We've been canvassing the area but we still don't have any leads.<eos> What about these surveillance cameras?<eos> They're all pointed in this direction so we have multiple angles of the mayor getting hit but almost none looking the other way.
It's a winning hand.<eos> My whole life, I've been dealt crap.<eos> Finally, I got a royal flush.<eos> Finally a win.<eos> That's what this is -- my ticket out.<eos> This city.<eos> It's so damn beautiful.<eos> It's like a sky full of stars, but only from a distance.<eos> Up close, it's all gutter.<eos> Those islands you fought on -- I bet they were pretty, too, huh?

Your daughter will die from diabetic shock.<eos> Or sooner.<eos> I'll be honest with you, Dr. Hunt.<eos> Killing that girl was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.<eos> But I will do it again if I have to.<eos> We need an answer now, Dr. Hunt.<eos> Will you perform the surgery or not?<eos> Yeah, I'll do it.<eos> All right, fellas.<eos> Look, these pictures, they aren't in real time.
I just know what they all look like dead.<eos> No, it's more than that.<eos> I know what they'll look like dying... having their throats cut.<eos> I can't sleep.<eos> Um, I just have... when I start thinking about everything that happened, uh, I start to sweat profusely.<eos> I just feel like shit, I mean, whenever anything or any situation's overwhelming... just everything, I mean.<eos> What's your experience of... fighting alongside women in the battlefield?<eos> They don't belong there.<eos> A 7,000-foot mountain... we gotta get to the top of it. I gotta hump my ass up there with a 100lb pack on my back.<eos> You think they can do that shit?

Who gives a shit what he says?<eos> He told me I could be barred from re-entering the country if I didn't leave now.<eos> So, what are you gonna do, try and re-open your skin?<eos> My brother owns a broker-dealer, he offered me a job.<eos> Wall Street?<eos> I'll be rich, not super-rich.<eos> I can deal.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> What?<eos> Oh. I hide it in there from the maids. They hate bran.

That's all right.<eos> Being chased out of that building is a badge in my book.<eos> Thought this would be a good place for us to meet.<eos> It's private.<eos> Shooting helps me relax.<eos> You like guns?<eos> No, not really.<eos> No?<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I've seen what they can do.
I'm like a fish.<eos> At least you can wash hair, that's something.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But look.<eos> Hold my sandwich.<eos> Eat more if you want.<eos> Look at my hands.<eos> What?<eos> Touch them.<eos> They're gross.
Fucking old fogey!<eos> You're right, it's true.<eos> I never talk to you about your dad.<eos> I should tell you things about his life.<eos> About his job.<eos> About how he skipped meetings to make it home for your bath.<eos> And about the stories he told you.<eos> God, he was so bad at telling stories.<eos> He was hopeless.<eos> But you loved them because he made up voices and they were about weird places.
I had MLA Anandraj killed.<eos> Okay, sir.<eos> Handle it.<eos> Where can I find Lakha?<eos> At the fields near the mountains.<eos> Kill him.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Wait. Brother. How long will it take to build a body like this?<eos> Dhauliya, the girls haven't arrived yet.<eos> They are here.
- all in the last eight months.<eos> - I thought there were seven.<eos> - There were.<eos> - When did you tag the eighth?<eos> About three minutes before I walked into your lecture hall.<eos> You're calling them abductions because you don't have any bodies?<eos> No bodies, no parts of bodies, nothing that comes out of bodies.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Then those girls weren't taken from where you think they were taken.<eos> Then where were they taken from?

Cheers.<eos> Okay.<eos> What about the girl you brought to the house?<eos> W-what was her name?<eos> I just call her not-Laurie.<eos> - Well, not to her face.<eos> - No.<eos> - Once, but... - Oh.<eos> It was dark. We were making out. The weird part is, forgetting her name made her like me more.<eos> Why is it the second you start treating girls like crap, they can't keep their clothes on?
And suddenly, we have a motive.<eos> Pretty tiny motive.<eos> And a... flawed one at that.<eos> Um, Hank?<eos> If that's not a motive, then... maybe this is.<eos> What?<eos> And if I'm not mistaken, that right there is a treasure map.<eos> I'm telling you, that is definitely a treasure map.<eos> It's not a treasure map. Treasure maps don't exist.<eos> They were invented by Robert Louis Stevenson, and then the myth was cemented by "B" Hollywood movies.
Another life ago, back when you weren't afraid to get your hands a little dirty.<eos> I was always drawn to how the mind works.<eos> I found it much more dynamic than how the brain works.<eos> The projected image is more interesting than the projector, until, of course, the projector breaks down.<eos> So, Will, these headaches.<eos> When did they begin in earnest?<eos> Two to three months ago.<eos> About the time Will went back into the field, which is when I met him.<eos> And the hallucinations?<eos> I can't really say when they started.
He even tied little bows with some of them.<eos> Yeah, it's really impressive.<eos> The Chesapeake Ripper would not have left the organs behind.<eos> Well, if Gideon isn't the Chesapeake Ripper, he's certainly trying to get his attention.<eos> Local PD picked up a foot trail leading out of the woods.<eos> Boot soles are consistent with the ones<eos> - we found at the crime scene.<eos> - How fresh are the tracks?<eos> - Two, three hours old.<eos> - Which direction they headed?
I don't know why he would feel the need to be sneaky.<eos> He is registered as one of her guardians.<eos> The irony.<eos> Give us a minute here.<eos> How's the book coming?<eos> There's plot holes.<eos> Tell me how you're filling them in.<eos> Did Abigail Hobbs kill Nick Boyle?<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> Abigail is one of those very smart girls who hasn't quite figured out that very smart girls grow up and know all the moves they're making when they're trying to hide something.

Jack's wrong about Abigail.<eos> - Let me reach out to her my own way.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm alana bloom.<eos> - Are you a doctor?<eos> - Not medicine.<eos> I'm a psychiatrist.<eos> - What do you specialize in?<eos> - Among other things, Family trauma.<eos> - I asked the nurses if my parents were dead, And they wouldn't tell me.
Go places and think about killing?<eos> - Too often.<eos> - So you pretended to be my dad.<eos> - And people like your dad.<eos> - What did it feel like?<eos> To be him?<eos> - It feels... Like... I'm talking to his shadow suspended on dust.<eos> - No wonder you have nightmares.<eos> - The attacks on you and your mother Were different.<eos> They were desperate.
False faces in family portraits.<eos> Layers and layers of lies, betrayed by a sad glint in the child's eyes.<eos> Norman Rockwell with a bullet.<eos> Alright, any signs of forced entry?<eos> No broken windows or torn screens.<eos> - All sealed up tight.<eos> - Yeah they probably rang the front door.<eos> I got bulletholes on the upper section of the wall, and again over here.<eos> Pull the slugs for ballistics.<eos> They aren't frangible, shouldn't be a problem
I know you're anxious to get on with it.<eos> You have talked to Gideon before, for some length of time.<eos> Well, I saw him mainly in court.<eos> I wrote an article about him in the journal of criminal psychology.<eos> He is very familiar with you.<eos> He has given you a lot of thought.<eos> You had some sessions with him?<eos> Yes, two, a couple years ago when he was first institutionalized.<eos> I've read your notes, of course.<eos> They were more or less helpful as I conducted my own interviews with Dr. Gideon over the years.
No, he'd want him awake.<eos> Organs were removed.<eos> Not all of them. He took the liver, Thymus, but left the heart.<eos> What's he doing with the organs?<eos> Surgical trophies.<eos> He's a medical doctor, isn't he?<eos> Is that why you call him The Ripper?<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> Psychopaths are attracted to surgical fields.<eos> They offer power.
- This is my friend Tobias. - Good evening.<eos> - I hate being this neurotic.<eos> - If you weren't neurotic,<eos> Franklyn, you would be something much worse.<eos> Whatever the Ripper was doing, it worked.<eos> These strings are harder to bow than the regular ones.<eos> You have to learn how to bow authentic strings to better bow strings how they're made today.<eos> I should learn to play the easier strings first, then the harder ones.<eos> No, you shouldn't.<eos> Are they really made from cat guts?
Seven graves.<eos> Way too many heads.<eos> The headpiece appears to be the only recent victim.<eos> The others are years, even decades, old.<eos> And we know that seven of the bodies were buried out here.<eos> Whoever dug them up knew exactly where they were buried.<eos> I guess it wasn't enough for him to kill them once;<eos> he had to come back and defile his victims.<eos> These graves weren't desecrated, Jack;<eos> they were exposed.
The one you cannot admit even to yourself.<eos> (softly): I helped him.<eos> - I can't hear you.<eos> - I helped him.<eos> I knew what my father was.<eos> I knew what he did.<eos> I...<eos> I was the one who... met the girls, talked to them.<eos> Laughed and joked.<eos> Found out where they lived, where they were going, when they'd be alone.

I'll go grab that.<eos> You know what?<eos> Don't bother.<eos> Now we got meth coming over the border at a rate so fast, we can barely keep up.<eos> And where's it coming in from?<eos> Well, Mexico, originally, but this stuff's been hitting town by way of fort erie.<eos> Six months ago, we placed two undercovers at the border.<eos> McNally and Collins?<eos> Keep going.<eos> The shipments... they go out every few weeks.

You see, sight is a funny thing. One of the five senses, but... not one of our finest.<eos> You live in the dark as long as I have and you lose your reliance on it... only then, can you truly begin to live in the light.<eos> - To know what is right.<eos> - What is right?<eos> Ripping a man to shreds is barbaric.<eos> What you saw in that wheelbarrel was merely an oily bit of toast after a long, dry wintery season.<eos> A fatted calf... to mark the end of a great fasting.<eos> So... disgruntled audience member trying to rid the world of nerds, or sewer Alligator annoyed by bad portrayal?<eos> Take a look at these...<eos> Take a look at these incisions... they look like they were made by teeth, but...
He was the one that would not eat mushrooms.<eos> I know which one he is, Cutler.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Ugh. - Stand up!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Get up.<eos> I don't feel 'em.<eos> - What?<eos> - My balls.<eos> They've ceased screaming.
Do I look like I am capable of shenanigans?<eos> All right, then. Show me your keys. (Laughs)<eos> I'm not gonna show you anything.<eos> I'm a person.<eos> Yeah, a person without keys.<eos> And if I say I have my keys, then I have my keys.<eos> I have my keys.<eos> But I can't see 'em?<eos> No.<eos> 'Cause they're in a delightful place.
She said she was wrong, that the angel of death tonight wasn't you, but that the darkness of the coming apocalypse is now upon us.<eos> What?<eos> She says, you alone hold the key.<eos> She says, if you continue on your quest, it'll bring about the end of the world.<eos> Tell her if i stop,<eos> I'll...i'll lose my wife, and i can't do that.<eos> What does she mean by that, Hank?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why would she say the end of the world is coming?<eos> The angel pours his bowl into the rivers, and they become as blood.
As I twisted and turned while he was whipping me, I could feel how clever his knots were.<eos> If I fought them, they would get tighter, and as I relaxed, it seemed they did, too.<eos> I don't know what kind of knot K used, but I know of a knot that tightens when force is exerted and vice versa.<eos> It's called a Pruzik knot. It's after a man called Pruzik.<eos> He was a mountain climber, and he and a friend were out climbing and they had an accident, and his friend died.<eos> And he ended up hanging at the end of a rope with no possibility of getting up.<eos> You know, you can't climb up a mountain climber rope.<eos> But he was an intelligent man, and with his back to the wall, he was a genius.<eos> He took the shoelaces out of his boots and made two loops and affixed them to the rope.<eos> And he could move these up when they weren't under tension. And then he could step into them and climb the rope and save himself. Pruznik.
Are you ready for another chapter?<eos> Go on.<eos> CHAPER SEVEN THE MIRROR<eos> Some years later, the bodily abuse began to have an effect.<eos> First, rare bleedings from my clitoris, but then they became more and more frequent.<eos> Come in!<eos> Have you heard any of the rumours about yourself?<eos> They say you see men every evening and spend all night with them. They say you can't be trusted, all of them.<eos> Why do they say that?<eos> I suppose they're afraid that I ... I can't keep away from their men.
I'm sure it was quite natural for you to furnish your room as a monk's cell, but as an inspiration for this story chapter headings hasn't been easy.<eos> There's simply nothing left for me to use.<eos> Well, I'm sorry about that.<eos> But if I may, I can give you a tip.<eos> Yes, please.<eos> You know, I occupy myself mostly with texts, but sometimes the text can seem so ... so empty, so unfathomably empty.<eos> It could be the best text by the most famous author.<eos> The solution might be to change your point of view.<eos> I don't get that.<eos> Things hide when they become familiar.

I had for a long time known about this man, L.<eos> Hi, my name is Joe.<eos> I know that.<eos> Come in.<eos> I'm looking for a job.<eos> I've been working in an office, and I was never really good at it.<eos> I can understand that.<eos> I mean, what's the point?<eos> I believe I possess some qualifications and that I'm rather unscrupulous.<eos> I know all about your qualifications and they're excellent.
It's OK to be a ghost.<eos> It has its pleasures.<eos> You're light.<eos> You float.<eos> You slip in and out unseen.<eos> There's no love to lose... or burden to be.<eos> You have so little to hold you down.<eos> You are free.<eos> Some pearls are never found.<eos> They hide under the sand on the ocean floor.

It was good.<eos> All right. cool.<eos> I got to get back.<eos> I got a hot date waiting for me, a girl, so...<eos> Oh, cool.<eos> you know, don't be late tomorrow, or I'm gonna dock you.<eos> Just kidding.<eos> OK.<eos> Eileen, it was so great meeting you, oh, and I loved hearing about your job, and I'd love to hear more and maybe share more with you about, like, certain really interesting things going on at Abaddonn that you might want to know<eos> and certain people, like what they're up to, people who are, like, closer than you could ever imagine, just, like, right there, you know, et cetera, et cetera.
- You flexed your forearm.<eos> - Okay, I didn't intentionally flex my forearm.<eos> I rolled up my shirt because you insist on it<eos> - being, like, 78 degrees in here.<eos> - You know what, Dom.<eos> Dom.<eos> Dom.<eos> Dom, forget it.<eos> What is it you want?<eos> I want things to go back to the way they were before.
Yeah.<eos> I know I did.<eos> Please.<eos> Please, please, let's not fight.<eos> Okay.<eos> So I'm sorry.<eos> I'm just...<eos> I'm a little thrown.<eos> I thought things were good with us lately.<eos> They are. Things are great.
Are you sure?<eos> Yes, I'm sure.<eos> I crouched behind the counter.<eos> I know he didn't see me.<eos> Karen.<eos> You're right.<eos> I hadn't left anything, but now I have.<eos> - You left...<eos> - My sunglasses on the table.<eos> They were right there on the table, but he was coming in.
I know he didn't see me.<eos> Karen.<eos> You're right.<eos> I hadn't left anything, but now I have.<eos> - You left...<eos> - My sunglasses on the table.<eos> They were right there on the table, but he was coming in.<eos> I had to go. Oh!<eos> Uh, okay. Th... there's no way to connect you to those sunglasses, right?<eos> I mean, it... they could be any woman's.
Sorry about that.<eos> Tell us where Joey Matthews is.<eos> Oh, is that all?<eos> Do you think I'm stupid?<eos> I'm not talking.<eos> I think you're looking at the death penalty.<eos> I'll never make it to the chair.<eos> I'm a correctional officer.<eos> I won't last a week in prison, but can I tell you a little secret?<eos> It was worth it to kill those girls, to hold them in my hands while they died, felt their last breath.
I don't care about the photos right now.<eos> Daniel, are we gonna talk about this?<eos> Now you want to talk?<eos> When were you gonna tell me he was having these dreams? I didn't think it was a big deal.<eos> - Kids have nightmares. - Yeah.<eos> Yeah. They don't act them out, though.<eos> Obviously, I was wrong.<eos> It's not funny, Sammy.<eos> Just tell them where the photos are.<eos> But I don't know where they are.
One card, two cards.<eos> Next.<eos> Maestro!<eos> Maestro Rodriguez!<eos> Simon!<eos> The noble savage finally wakes up!<eos> It all started here, Simon.<eos> Here in this market.<eos> There were a lot of hungry women.<eos> They complained about the price of bread, right?
Where's your mama at?<eos> Huh? Maybe he wants me.<eos> What?<eos> Maybe he wants me.<eos> Maybe he does.<eos> But you still have two more bites.<eos> "And the little horse ran and ran.<eos> "And the foxes chased him, "and he could hear them barking'.<eos> "And the wolves ran after him,<eos> "and he could hear them howling'. But he knew they couldn't catch him."
The boys he broke free with got caught trying to hop a train up near Bartlesville heading north.<eos> Maybe Bob's doing likewise.<eos> Maybe he's already long gone.<eos> Maybe.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Anybody asking about him? Anybody at all?<eos> Nope.<eos> What about those letters?<eos> Everyone read them before they even got sent. They don't say anything.
Oh, you think so?<eos> Well, I'll tell you what.<eos> You do whatever you want.<eos> You take all your money, and you get yourself as far away from here as you possibly can.<eos> But you listen to me when I tell you, you leave those girls alone.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Yeah, you can.<eos> And why would I?<eos> Well, now, think about it, Bob.<eos> If you got any trouble coming your way, they sure as hell don't need that.
From now on, it's one slice of brown bread.<eos> Four, no let's say six olives.<eos> A small piece of cheese.<eos> The size of a matchbox.<eos> Yes.<eos> And an egg, but only once a week.<eos> How's that?<eos> Good.<eos> Where did these plates come from?<eos> Are they the hotel's?

It's hard to live with somebody, don't you think?<eos> Okay, listen to this.<eos> I like guacamole.<eos> But I don't like the onions in guacamole, so I take a chip and swirl it around and separate the onions from the guacamole so I can eat it.<eos> Now, that drove her bananas.<eos> It sounds pretty harmless.<eos> I thought so, but by the end of our marriage, it made her gag.<eos> That's not nice.<eos> You have lovely hands.<eos> I thought, as a masseuse, you'd have big, muscular hands, but they're very lovely. Thank you.
What about them, Mr Crabb?<eos> Oh, yes, I see.<eos> Curtsey doesn't look right in knickerbockers, does it?<eos> You can do a boy's bow.<eos> Like this.<eos> (ALL GIGGLE) Yes.<eos> Carry on.<eos> I'm sure you'll be fine on the night.<eos> How are the windows coming along?<eos> They're coming along very well.
(Sighs) What is it this time, Dorrit?<eos> Don't feel like you're getting enough attention?<eos> Well, you're about to get more than you bargained for.<eos> I'm telling dad.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I'm not the one desperate for attention, wearing mom's apron and trying to pretend to be her, like you can just take her place.<eos> I'm not trying to pretend anything, Dorrit.<eos> I'm trying to honor mom's memory by making things feel the same.<eos> But they're not, and you can't make them that way.
Take my throne.<eos> What?<eos> Show us your power.<eos> You're ready.<eos> Show the world your vagina.<eos> I was not the only Bradshaw in a terrifying situation.<eos> Anyway, so, yeah, my 16-year-old daughter needed tampons, and guess who had to go get 'em? Me.<eos> Which, uh, you probably do all the time.<eos> So it's not a big mystery to you, but, you know, the big problem, really, at our house, is, uh, the fact that my girls don't get along.<eos> They... they...

Stop.<eos> All this talking and snooping and talking...<eos> It's just way too complicated.<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> Now I knew what it said on Sebastian's label...<eos> "Contents under pressure.<eos> Handle with care."<eos> Unfortunately, I never bothered to read it.<eos> That's the tricky thing about labels.<eos> Once in a while, they tell us everything we need to know.
A man who loved his daughters the only way he knew how.<eos> I'm afraid to think what this will cost me.<eos> I hate to tell you this, but you still have to pay for the hamster.<eos> Dorrit, we need to talk.<eos> You didn't tell me that...<eos> Right now the label on me would say, "heartbroken, extra large."<eos> ...Apparently was able to walk out of the store with a hamster the other day, so we still...<eos> We still need to pay for it.<eos> ♪ Who's gonna drive you home but the one thing that you have to remember about labels...<eos> They only matter if you let them stick.
Isn't it a little tragic to go alone and not have your boyfriend to grind against?<eos> No. What's tragic is someone who can't be alone.<eos> I don't have that problem.<eos> Me, either, but I'm me.<eos> I'm always the best thing in the room.<eos> Without a hot guy like Walt, you're just positively average.<eos> When you see me on the dance floor, you will take that back.<eos> Oh. That's so pathetic.<eos> I can already see you dancing with your sad little girlfriends.<eos> I know they won't have dates either.

Hair of the dog.<eos> With Walt, I just got used to it.<eos> Of course, now I have to get used to Walt never talking to me again.<eos> You can't keep avoiding Walt.<eos> Yes, I can.<eos> Maybe it won't be so bad now that he and Donna broke up.<eos> Thank God I don't have to see that anymore.<eos> Ugh. There are some things I can never un-see.<eos> I know we're never getting back together.<eos> I just wish things could be the way they used to be,
And he helped me realize I'm not a freak.<eos> And now I look back on High School and think, well, that explains the Steve McQueen posters.<eos> Walt found himself taking the first step down a new, unmarked trail.<eos> And he wasn't the only one.<eos> I guess you would call it a coming-of-age story.<eos> My main character is a virgin, but her friends are teaching her all about sex.<eos> It's so smart to make it about sex.<eos> Sex sells.<eos> - What do they teach her?<eos> - They tell her that sex is like putting a hot dog in a keyhole.
Carrie, your feet are spectacular.<eos> They're divine, really.<eos> Well, my feet thank you.<eos> Careful.<eos> They may get too big for these shoes if they get any more praise.<eos> (Chuckles)<eos> Not like I'll ever get to wear them again.<eos> Of course you will.<eos> They're yours.<eos> No, they're... "Bloonik" somebody's.
What happened to my daughter?<eos> The girl who understood responsibility and... and consequences, who looked before she jumped.<eos> What happened to that girl?<eos> I don't know.<eos> (Sighs)<eos> I-I didn't mean to...<eos> Everything just got out of hand, and... and then there I was, with this whole other life, here in... in Manhattan, and...<eos> Well, say good-bye to that life and New York, because you won't be seeing it again...<eos> Ever.<eos> Putting my shoes away was hard, but I knew they were in a safe place until I could wear them again.
As I can attest to, it can feel like a pretty small town when you're struggling with stuff.<eos> Let me think about it.<eos> You living alone in New York would be a big deal.<eos> So it's not a "no"?<eos> It is not a "no"<eos> I'll take it.<eos> Geoffrey Chaucer wrote, "time heals all wounds. "<eos> But what he failed to mention was the scars those wounds leave behind.<eos> The painful things that happen to us permanently leave their mark.<eos> They don't necessarily hurt anymore but they're always there as a reminder, as a memory.
Are you just gonna ask him?<eos> No.<eos> I have an idea, but I need your help.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Come with me.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> Thank you for the flowers.<eos> They... they were so sweet.
That's all you wanted.<eos> He got carnations... 'cause they're cheaper, and he was paying.<eos> You deserved the peonies.<eos> But, hey... I got you... the man who married me despite my... drunk, cheap, narcissistic father.<eos> - Low bar. - [Chuckles]<eos> I'm so pissed... that you're going.<eos> [Groans] Oh.<eos> I always loved your hands.<eos> Even when I hated your guts, I loved your hands.<eos> They still make me feel safe.

All right, I'll take it, but only if you have some pie.<eos> Go get two forks.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Do you have any peonies?<eos> Yes, we do.<eos> Could I just get a whole bunch of them?<eos> The best ones you have?<eos> Someone's a lucky lady.<eos> Hello?<eos> Oh, Paul, they're beautiful.
Oh, God. I'm 36 years old.<eos> It's been three years. [ Sighs ]<eos> Are we really still just two guys banging each other?<eos> Please, stop moving my gun.<eos> Then stop leaving it by the bed.<eos> [ Sighs ] Maybe we want kids, huh?<eos> Some real meaning in our lives?<eos> Or if we're just gonna say,<eos> "screw all that," let's at least do it together.<eos> I like things the way they are.
You ride with an army against Spartacus?<eos> Yes to defend the Republic, as is the duty of all Romans.<eos> I'm a Roman.<eos> I will go with you.<eos> [ laughs ] Oh, would that you were of an age, to stand by your father's side.<eos> Now for your bed, Publius, and dream of future laurels.<eos> Yes, father.<eos> He would follow you to the shores of the afterlife, if so commanded.<eos> As would Tiberius.<eos> He will hold place amongst my troops when they march.
One of vital importance, if we are to gain victory.<eos> It is plan born of fevered mind.<eos> As often springs from his brow.<eos> Yet if we can see it-- If.<eos> A word forever casting shadow.<eos> You burn brightly enough to light darkest night.<eos> I voice concern and you offer flattery.<eos> I offer truth.<eos> Your fire blazes to rival the fucking sun.<eos> These hands, once trembled with broken memory, now stand as strong as the steel they wield.
Ike Turner, oh my goodness.<eos> Ike and Tina Turner.<eos> I just...<eos> I couldn't believe he asked me if I wanted to start working right away.<eos> And I said, "Well, yes, of course."<eos> But little did I know he meant that week.<eos> I think we were the first action figures of RB,<eos> The Ikettes, the Ike and Tina Turner Review.<eos> The girls were absolutely sensational.<eos> Tina was a force of nature, of course, but they were no slouches either.

Oh, yeah.<eos> A hot one.<eos> All right. Cool.<eos> And by having sex with you, would I be saving the world?<eos> Hey, week one.<eos> Jules is spinning.<eos> It would really help if you could apologize for what you did in her dream.<eos> No problem.<eos> Should I also bring her flowers, or should I just give her one of those little ring boxes with my nuts in it?<eos> It's sad that they could fit in a ring box.
It means he will be like you, and therefore he will want to do better than you, and you will hate him for it.<eos> How can you tell that by just looking at my face?<eos> It's the same with trees.<eos> I can tell which trees will make the best planks just by looking at them.<eos> I can look inside the tree.<eos> Floki is a boat-builder.<eos> Among other things.<eos> This is one.<eos> Inside this tree are two almost perfect planks.<eos> They will bend, then curve, like a woman's bod from the thighs to the back.
Unreal.<eos> What did that feel like?<eos> It's great to know that we could get that far with our voice.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Thank you!<eos> Daly: Blake keeps his winning streak alive As the two-time "voice" champ<eos> Scores his first artists of season four.<eos> "hey, miranda, how you doing, baby?"<eos> "yeah, miranda, so, I got these hot identical twins."<eos> "they picked me.
You made it.<eos> So nice to meet you.<eos> When I turned my chair, I tried to play it cool, Because as soon as I went like...<eos> You know, like this, they would have turned their chairs.<eos> They're way too curious.<eos> In my four seasons, I'd never seen anything like that before.<eos> You'll be able to do things with him that defy gravity<eos> Because of how high he can go,<eos> And women go crazy over a guy with a falsetto.<eos> They love that. [ laughs ] [ man laughs ] yeah! All right!
Rhymes with sniper.<eos> Inmate Robinson to the visitor area.<eos> You hungry?<eos> Not really.<eos> Guard Thomson to the tower.<eos> Eat anyway.<eos> It's burrata.<eos> Thank you.<eos> My mother told her friends I'm doing volunteer work in Africa.<eos> I bet they're all appalled that you've gone somewhere so filthy and dangerous.
Because there's a can behind you.<eos> I won't barf.<eos> I will be truly displeased if you barf anywhere but in that can.<eos> Not gonna barf.<eos> Miss Chapman, no one's gonna mess with you here unless you let them.<eos> This isn't Oz.<eos> Women fight with gossip and rumors.<eos> They might peg you for rich and try to hit you up for commissary.<eos> And there are lesbians.<eos> They're not gonna bother you.

Ciao.<eos> Romanet called.<eos> Your mobile was going to voicemail.<eos> There's a mole at the Élysée.<eos> I think he understood.<eos> A courier delivered them just now.<eos> No message, no name.<eos> Don't worry, I know who they're from.<eos> Like my flowers?<eos> They brought back memories.
- Where is the cellar.<eos> - Tell him.<eos> I don't know.<eos> We'll wait here and block the door.<eos> I think someone's coming!<eos> Don't say a word.<eos> Sebastien, are you OK?<eos> Where are the videos?<eos> Now you can cry.<eos> Where are they?
I think someone's coming!<eos> Don't say a word.<eos> Sebastien, are you OK?<eos> Where are the videos?<eos> Now you can cry.<eos> Where are they?<eos> Your mate said you have them.<eos> Which mate?<eos> The videos aren't here.<eos> - Where are they?
I know that you're in a bad marriage.<eos> - It isn't bad at all.<eos> - No, don't lie.<eos> - I've been there too.<eos> - I love my husband.<eos> I hate that he orders you around.<eos> I hate that you're not free.<eos> I am enjoying our visits together very much.<eos> Me too.<eos> If they are to continue, you must learn to control your hatred.
In New York, I could protect you.<eos> [Exhales]<eos> I don't need your protection.<eos> Can you not...<eos> C... can you not recognize that it wasn't easy for me to come here after everything that happened?<eos> I didn't ask you to come here.<eos> I didn't ask you to insert yourself into my life.<eos> Right, because you don't need anybody.<eos> Those Human connections, they just slow you down.<eos> - They make you weak.
Be my guest.<eos> You know, it feels really weird.<eos> I... I barely recognize the city anymore.<eos> Well, you were gone for a while.<eos> I'll give you the talk again.<eos> Oliver Shaw.<eos> I'm your training officer.<eos> Hey. How are the girls?<eos> They're great.<eos> They're great.
You know, a city where... where a beautiful woman walks into your office and wants to make sweet, sweet, sweet love... (Speaking Italian)<eos> Slow down. Do you speak English?<eos> Would you, uh, make sure you take snaps of all the drawers and the vault?<eos> Got it.<eos> - (Camera shutter clicking and beeping) - (Woman) Thank you.<eos> (Man) Yes, we've got statements from everyone.<eos> Well, witnesses all say the same thing.<eos> Sleeping baby is all they remember.<eos> Mm. It's kinda true, you know.<eos> I used to carry the girls around in one those things when they were little.
What do you mean, ditched?<eos> He means they cut.<eos> But they're 10. 10 year olds don't get to cut school.<eos> Where would they even go?<eos> The bookstore on Ventura.<eos> Apparently, Selena Gomez was there signing her autobiography.<eos> Teenagers don't get to have autobiographies.<eos> - What is going on here?<eos> - The girls heard that Sharon Galecki was driving Olivia.<eos> They lied to her and said we gave our permission.

Oh, you'd be surprised.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Like, how obnoxious is obnoxious?<eos> Well... dancing on the tables obnoxious or...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Uh, will you do me a favor and file these motions in the courthouse in Van Nuys?<eos> The courthouse in Van Nuys?<eos> Yeah. Is there a problem?<eos> Well, I'm just new to L.A., so I haven't really figured out the freeways yet.<eos> - They're so scary. - Yeah.
I don't care.<eos> You should, though, if the friendship truly matters to you.<eos> Harry, I appreciate your concern, but Alex an I talked about it, and we're good.<eos> Well, you might think you're good, but come on.<eos> Haven't you seen all those terrible movies where you learn that friends can't have sex with each other?<eos> Yeah, but the lesson I learned is not to be the boring straight person whose conventional values never bring them any happiness.<eos> Joss, sometimes having values is what brings you happiness.<eos> You know what?<eos> Screw you, Harry.<eos> Just because they're not the same as yours doesn't mean you get to judge me.
Spotting is perfectly normal at this stage.<eos> But we've got some other problems to discuss if you want to have a healthy pregnancy.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Your blood pressure is a real concern, Savi, so is your heart rate. They're both off the charts.<eos> Do you have any idea what could be causing this?<eos> Uh, I've been under a lot of stress lately at home and at work.<eos> Anything we should discuss?<eos> It's just all normal stuff.<eos> Well, it's a problem.<eos> Things can't continue the way they are.
So I go to this party and Scott's like, "You should totally rush."<eos> And I'm like, "That's retarded."<eos> "That's for idiots who were stupid enough to go to Dartmouth."<eos> I'm on a hunger strike.<eos> You're one of them, I can tell.<eos> Or I'm just not hungry.<eos> Or you secretly want to starve yourself.<eos> Duh, what girl doesn't?<eos> None of those girls give a fuck about the janitors.<eos> They just don't want to look like they're anorexic.

Creepy or charismatic?<eos> The two go hand in hand.<eos> That's the kind of guy you got to look out for.<eos> People use the term "female circumcision," but "female genital mutilation"<eos> more accurately describes what nearly two million girls go through every year.<eos> Some cultures use a blade.<eos> Like this one.<eos> But more commonly, FGM is done with piece of broken glass, the lid of a tin can, or a sharpened stone.<eos> Once the clitoris or outer genitalia is removed, the girl is then sewn up and her legs are bound for 40 days while the wounds heal.<eos> If they heal at all.
Knock yourself out.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Have you ever had fantasies of saving a dying tribe?<eos> Of protecting them from encroaching civilization?<eos> Well, an opportunity has come up to turn that fantasy into reality.<eos> For those of you who care enough to join us.<eos> In two weeks, an untouched jungle in the Peruvian Amazon will be destroyed forever.<eos> And so will the natives inside it.<eos> The companies want the natural gas in the ground under the villages.<eos> So they GPS the location, bulldoze the homes, and kill the natives.
Then, the other day, we were singing this, like, romantic song together and then, right at the end, I thought that... she was gonna say it to me.<eos> Say what?<eos> Oh... It.<eos> Wha-What would you have done?<eos> I would have said it back.<eos> I mean, that's the way I feel.<eos> Then you have to tell her first. N...<eos> I can't do that.<eos> That's... terrifying.<eos> Chicks dig hot guys who are willing to get naked for a calendar, but what they're really looking for is a guy who will get naked emotionally.
But do you guys have to go? Can you stay a little bit longer?<eos> 'Cause I would love to buy you dinner.<eos> I'm in.  Sure.<eos> Good, okay.<eos> I'm in no rush to get back to Kentucky.<eos> I think I could get used to it here in New York.<eos> It's more my speed.<eos> You ready to write that essay?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Well, I've been doing a little research, um, with some folks that know you really well, and... they all seem to think that you've actually accomplished quite a bit.

We're gonna bring out your inner diva if it kills me.<eos> Aw, Blainey Days.<eos> Have you ever been with a girl?<eos> No.<eos> Perfect gold star gay.<eos> Except for that one time where I kissed Rachel Berry.<eos> That doesn't count.<eos> Well, it's not that I don't like girls.<eos> I love them.<eos> They're very kind and sensitive, and their bodies are beautiful.
Are you kidding me?<eos> You would kill it.<eos> I was thinking that we could use...<eos> One of those dresses from Sectionals.<eos> I'm sorry, that-that cold medicine is really very strong.<eos> - Why don't you lie down? - Okay.<eos> It's a good idea.<eos> You know, I've been reading a lot about divas.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> And the biggest thing is that they're brutally honest.
Eh, a little catfight is good for friends.<eos> You know, keeps the relationship fresh.<eos> I thought we already checked this box.<eos> Will said the white centrepiece arrangements we picked were fine.<eos> Which means he doesn't like them.<eos> And he'd like to veto them, but he's just being polite.<eos> Um, "fine" doesn't mean that he didn't like the centrepieces.<eos> I need things to be more than fine.<eos> Okay, I-I need them to be perfect.<eos> They have to be perfect and I need them to be perfect.
Look, I'm not gonna pretend like I understand everything that's going on with you.<eos> But you have a truth, and as your friend,<eos> I need to support that truth, so... you're a girl, dude.<eos> Holy crap, did I mess that up?<eos> No, it's just... That day, after we sang... I decided to walk home in all my Leslie Uggams glory, and a group of popular girls came after me.<eos> ...serious? Look at this.<eos> Are you a boy or a girl?<eos> Hey! Freak!<eos> Lady Freak!<eos> I got home before they caught up to me, but I was so scared.
(door opens, closes) All right, why would you tell people that I'm afraid to let you go to New York?<eos> Because I'm afraid to go, okay?<eos> I just thought it'd be easier to blame it on you.<eos> Well, you've never been afraid of anything in your life.<eos> Because my life has been pretty sheltered.<eos> Because you built that ramp that I just rolled down so I could get in the living room.<eos> Because you converted the den into my bedroom so I didn't have to go upstairs.<eos> Because you built that bathroom add-on...<eos> Artie, you did those things.<eos> They were all your suggestions.
Which explains why you haven't grasped the concept of personal space.<eos> - Just tell me what you got.<eos> - ( sighs )<eos> This is from the traffic camera at the county line yesterday morning.<eos> - How do you know that's him?<eos> - New York plates.<eos> And Rabbit usually rolls four cars deep.<eos> I tried calling our friendly neighborhood sheriff to put out an APB, but he's apparently not taking calls.<eos> At least not mine.<eos> I ran the plates, they're counterfeit.
But maybe I didn't make it clear.<eos> I'm not happy with you.<eos> I don't like that you lie to me or that you try to use my mother.<eos> Well, that's just because your mother agrees with me!<eos> You going to marry him?<eos> - Ricky?<eos> - Yes, Ricky.<eos> Yeah, yeah, we're planning on getting married.<eos> Of course, it would help if I could find my wedding rings.<eos> Yeah, they'll turn up.
Wait.<eos> Those are mine!<eos> Hello.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I knew you had these.<eos> Did you know that he was pretending to be married to you when he was sleeping on you?<eos> All right.<eos> That's enough.<eos> You were pretending to be married to me and you stole my wedding rings?<eos> Look, they were kind of falling off your finger and so I kind of slid them off and then you moved your hand and I couldn't put them back on so...
- I think it's edible.<eos> So how is the recon going?<eos> - It's fine.<eos> - Shoot.<eos> Well, the four jerks that were hitting on you before, they're in the 12th grade, and they organize the summer prom.<eos> Remind me not to attend.<eos> The big guy with the cap, he's the rugby team captain.<eos> He'd do anything to get good grades in math, and he's friends with Jimi Hendrix. Who's in love with the girl with the pink ribbon in her hair.<eos> And the girl coming straight from Gotham City, runs the school black market on cigarettes.<eos> The gossip girls over by the window, they're the sister of the son of a bitch who plays Dumbo in the corner.
Hey, look who's here!<eos> Yeah, you better run!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I got him!<eos> I got him!<eos> You piece of shit, I said stop!<eos> I said stop!<eos> I said stop!<eos> You're crushing my balls!<eos> I hope they fucking rupture!
Not in there.<eos> There is nothing I can do, Mullins.<eos> The FBI has jurisdiction.<eos> Maybe they're in here.<eos> Stop.<eos> Will you stop? Nope, they're not in there.<eos> What is she doing?<eos> She's looking for my balls.<eos> Hey, if anyone sees the Captain's balls let me know.<eos> They're about this big, but a lot tinier.

You're the first chick over forty to give me a boner.<eos> Great.<eos> Want to go get a drink? Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Maybe.<eos> That's the only reason girls hit on me.<eos> Oh, sorry, yeah.<eos> Every night, the hottest chicks come in here.<eos> They're like, "There's LeSoire!" Short skirts, too much makeup.

- No, that would be a suckling pig .<eos> Something more rare, you think?<eos> - No, no, who's going to fucking stop!<eos> Keep going or we'll lose her.<eos> - See? You're giving orders again!<eos> Drive!<eos> Come on! Drive! Want me to take the fucking wheel, Jaime?<eos> Stop!<eos> There are witches in a house.<eos> My father is with them. They tried to bake me in the oven .

- What are you doing?<eos> Ward fought for his job. Done.<eos> This morning and he won.<eos> He's not going anywhere.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I'll go without him.<eos> I couldn't care less if you move to California and I never saw you again, but you can't take my grandchildren anywhere.<eos> You know the price for disloyalty in this family.<eos> So you'll stand by your husband's side during this difficult time, or we'll make sure you're found unfit to parent.<eos> And the next time you see the girls, they won't remember your name.
You look like a pole dancer!<eos> Turn it off.<eos> Mom!<eos> Sweetie, you have to do the dishes.<eos> I'm going.<eos> I'm dying for some chocolates.<eos> Can you swim?<eos> How are you, Mom?<eos> Are those my earrings?<eos> They look good on you.
Yeah.<eos> You can just wear some of my clothes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks, Henry.<eos> The pants fit like a dream.<eos> Okay.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, where are you going?<eos> New plan:<eos> We do see Piper, but we do not see her mother.<eos> I like things the way they are.
Hey, now that she's gone, can I ask you something?<eos> Is she a ghost?<eos> Julian.<eos> Hey, mom,<eos> I found your old pantyhose commercial online.<eos> Hey, 54 views.<eos> Not too shabby.<eos> After a long day in the office, your legs must be tired and aching.<eos> Not at all.<eos> In fact, they feel fresh, lively, and ready for anything that might come up.
"What with?" he said.<eos> "Maybe we can sell you so that we could buy a cow."<eos> I knew he didn't mean it.<eos> But I also knew that if we were going to survive, we had to do something.<eos> And what really mattered was what Joe said to me before he went.<eos> He said it was down to me to look after everyone.<eos> He made you responsible.<eos> I... he... he sent us a postcard.<eos> Would you like to see it?<eos> Stay away from my hands, they shake because I'm old.
You should give her a name.<eos> She's a cow.<eos> The inspection's an hour away.<eos> I think they might walk out if you don't agree to this.<eos> These women need to go home and feed their babies.<eos> Right now.<eos> Ten minutes.<eos> Ten minutes?<eos> That's what I said.<eos> And if they're not back, this inspection fails, I'm out of business and none of you will have any work.
If that's the case then find yourself another companion!<eos> I can complete the mission on my own.<eos> There's no trace of Lucy and Paul in 1912, nor in the following years.<eos> We can assume they've joined the Florentine Alliance.<eos> - The men with the almond biscuits?<eos> - That's not funny.<eos> The Florentine Alliance has been one of the Lodge's most powerful enemies for centuries.<eos> They're an orthodox Christian order, they accuse us of heresy.<eos> Lucy spoke about prophecies.<eos> What do they say about the Ruby?
My staff expect to see me.<eos> People, not figures, are the difference between success and failure.<eos> I thought profit had more to do with it.<eos> We're still not breaking even.<eos> We have a little problem, Mr Selfridge.<eos> Hold your nerve, Crabb.<eos> Miss Love.<eos> Harry.<eos> Look at these pictures they've taken of me.<eos> They're just terrible.

Great.<eos> Just there.<eos> [Woman]:<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me!<eos> What the hell do you people think you're doing?<eos> I'm sorry, ma'am.<eos> I have official authorization to commandeer these flowers for reasons of national security.<eos> But they're my prize-winning flowers!<eos> Yes, I understand that they're beautiful...
The young brother has found it.<eos> Kill him, Quentin!<eos> You have to.<eos> [Grunts]<eos> [Gasps]<eos> There are good people here.<eos> If you try to assimilate, they will meet you halfway.<eos> I will do as you ask.<eos> You know, these visions of yours,<eos> - if they are somehow connected...
Yes...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Do you have a glass of Pinot Grigio?<eos> It's just red or white.<eos> I'll have white, please.<eos> I couldn't help overhearing you're a journalist.<eos> I know this woman, she had a baby when she was a teenager and she's kept it secret for 50 years.<eos> I only found out today.<eos> Sorry. The baby was taken from her by these nuns.<eos> - They made her have him adopted.
What's the matter?<eos> The girls in the kitchen said that Mother Barbara had Mary up at the house.<eos> What do you think they wanted with her?<eos> Phil.<eos> I'm sure it's nothing to worry about.<eos> I won't be a minute.<eos> - Phil, I've got something for you.<eos> - Kathleen's worried sick.<eos> She thinks they'll take Mary from her.<eos> I told her they'd tell her first for sure.
Some of the nuns were very nice.<eos> It was a breech birth.<eos> They wouldn't even give her any painkillers.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Again, story-wise.<eos> So, can we go and talk to these nuns?<eos> Uh, yes, well, you could try.<eos> Maybe you'll have more luck than Mum's had.<eos> I've been several times over the years to ask where he was.<eos> And they're very helpful, they're not like they used to be.

Sleep well.<eos> Cheers.<eos> - Been up to the Abbey? - Mm.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, it's um...<eos> Things obviously very different now.<eos> The nuns are different.<eos> Not the same ones they had when the Magdalen girls were there.<eos> Sure.<eos> They're all gone now!
If you just go... Let's just take a quick picture, see.<eos> You go stand by the line.<eos> - Is this for the article?<eos> - It is.<eos> Just go back further.<eos> Only I'm a little bit worried, because if we find him, he might be very disapproving of talking to the papers.<eos> Families are private things.<eos> I know.<eos> Go and stand back there.<eos> That's true, they are private, but tracking him down's an expensive business, and so it's sort of like a quid pro quo, isn't it?
You don't have to listen to this.<eos> - Not very Christian, is it?<eos> - Wait!<eos> Let me tell you something.<eos> I have kept my vow of chastity my whole life.<eos> Self-denial and mortification of the flesh... that's what brings us closer to God.<eos> Sister Hildegarde...<eos> Those girls have nobody to blame but themselves, and their own carnal incontinence.<eos> Sister Hildegarde, please!<eos> You mean they had sex?
I'm gonna make it my personal mission to make sure that you rot in prison for what you did to your daughters.<eos> You want to see the face of the devil?<eos> Take a look in the mirror.<eos> No?<eos> Fine.<eos> (Door opens)<eos> (Door closes)<eos> (Sighs)<eos> I don't know what to tell you, Mrs. Banks.<eos> I have no idea why your daughters are acting the way they are, but your husband is looking pretty damn guilty.
Maybe in combination with the P.C.P., it caused an acute reaction.<eos> They were sisters.<eos> They would have the same genetic tendency.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And dermal infection and conjunctivitis are both symptoms, which is why they looked possessed.<eos> I will check it out.<eos> Nicely done.<eos> Surprised?<eos> No. Pleased.<eos> Why didn't the girls just say they were on P.C.P.?

Yeah.<eos> Oh.<eos> Very classy.<eos> She have access to the P.C.P.?<eos> I guess.<eos> But why would she steal it?<eos> I mean, I know what a tweaker looks like.<eos> She was no tweaker.<eos> It wasn't for Hannah.<eos> She was poisoning her sisters, and they didn't know what was happening to them.
You pull that trigger, and God won't be able to help you.<eos> You'll condemn your soul to eternal damnation.<eos> I already have.<eos> Hannah, I know why you're doing this.<eos> You know nothing.<eos> Megan, stay back.<eos> You're angry with him, about your sisters, right?<eos> I tried to help them.<eos> I sacrificed everything to save their souls.<eos> No, they did nothing but disappoint you.
Megan, stay back.<eos> You're angry with him, about your sisters, right?<eos> I tried to help them.<eos> I sacrificed everything to save their souls.<eos> No, they did nothing but disappoint you.<eos> Chelsea is weak.<eos> And Rebecca was a drug addict.<eos> You worried about them so much.<eos> It wasn't fair.<eos> They were sinners.

But I'm the one that deserved it.<eos> I'd do anything for you.<eos> (Megan) Hannah.<eos> You were the good girl, weren't you?<eos> Yeah, I was, too.<eos> You did everything right.<eos> Nobody noticed.<eos> Is that why you made your sisters sick?<eos> I...<eos> I-I-I put P.C.P. in their food so that daddy would think they were using drugs and kick them out of the house.
You don't know who my brother is, do you?<eos> Figueroa Ray.<eos> I should have recognized him.<eos> The biggest dope man in L.A.<eos> Becomes a shell of himself because he's an addict.<eos> Funny how that works.<eos> The fool should have lost more than his hearing.<eos> My old partner and I ran into one of his rock dens back in the day.<eos> He had 13-year-old girls in there spread eagle on dirty mattresses.<eos> Tricking for food, a roof over their heads, and all the crack they could smoke.
I was afraid she would misunderstand.<eos> Do you have an address?<eos> Hey, don't knock it till you tried it.<eos> My whips and chains?<eos> My old lady's got some friends, all right?<eos> Fat ones, skinny ones, brown ones, white ones, freaky ones -- freaky ones.<eos> All 31 flavors.<eos> We could fix you up.<eos> No, you know me.<eos> The streets -- they've always been my significant other.
All right.<eos> Chlo...<eos> I think we should go with the black leggings.<eos> Yeah, maybe you're right, actually.<eos> Rae, try these leggings on.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> What happened to your legs, Rae?<eos> I was in an accident when I was in France.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Do they look horrible?
But I love it.<eos> If everyone is going to be there, I have to look nice.<eos> Right, Rae, when I say no to something, it doesn't mean keep arguing, it means end of discussion!<eos> I think I'm going to be sick.<eos> Oh, don't be so dramatic.<eos> 'You always wonder what it would be like to sit in front of a doctor 'and hear the worst possible news.<eos> 'How you'd cope, how you'd feel.'<eos> Rae, I'm afraid you're going to have to stop drinking alcohol.<eos> Why?<eos> The meds we switched you to, some people feel nauseous if they drink on them, especially at first.
Hello. It's nice to meet you.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm Tommy.<eos> Uh, we were hoping we could talk.<eos> With pleasure.<eos> Does this girl look familiar to you?<eos> I've never seen this girl, but this mark I have seen.<eos> I hope I never see it again.<eos> I don't know who's behind it, and I don't want to.<eos> My girls... they have good life.

Was one of these girls Oksana?<eos> (Czech accent) No, we do not know this Oksana.<eos> Two different girls with mark.<eos> Mystery man says if we see any girl with mark, give them his number.<eos> When I see marked girls two day later,<eos> I say, "there is handsome man looking for you."<eos> "Will pay good money if you contact him."<eos> Then I gave them one of his cards.<eos> This is his card?<eos> And they called that number?
When Oksana was taken from the streets of Kiev, her family hired me to find her.<eos> I followed her here.<eos> She had been sold into prostitution.<eos> So I went to the underground clubs.<eos> Like Tatyana's.<eos> Yes.<eos> I tell girls I meet,<eos> "if you see her, you call me,"<eos> "and if you call me, I get you out of the life as well."<eos> And finally two girls... they called.
This baby was alive.<eos> So my job was not done.<eos> Getting the baby to Oksana's parents.<eos> As I said, this story was not mine to tell.<eos> Not until I unite them.<eos> I have extracted, uh, many bullets in my years, but little Katya... this was my first delivery. (Chuckles)<eos> You had quite a night. (Laughs)<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> You called her Katya?<eos> Two extraordinary females... they come into my life in one night.
She didn't see any men?<eos> Sure.<eos> She got what she needed. - So Tage Baggesen was her...?<eos> - She had several.<eos> - Who was the last man she saw?<eos> - Does it matter who she slept with?<eos> - It does, if he killed her.<eos> - But you don't know if she was killed.<eos> Why would it be someone she knew?<eos> 95% of all murders on women are committed by the husband the boyfriend or someone they turned down.
He'll be second-guessing himself for a while, but he'll be fine.<eos> Doubt, huh?<eos> It's kinda my thing.<eos> Well, it was intense.<eos> Glad you enjoyed the show.<eos> - Any news?<eos> - Bo's test results are baffling.<eos> Her blood pressure is through the roof, but her glucose levels have come back completely normal.<eos> But the most distressing thing her cells are dying.<eos> They're being attacked.
It was incredible... but, different.<eos> glad you're sufficiently juiced.<eos> We got company<eos> Looks like they're guarding something in that cave.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Finally...<eos> Did you redo the samples?<eos> I did exactly as you asked and the data came back the same.<eos> Her cells are being destroyed and then... - Then what? - Replaced.<eos> - They're being replaced.
Absolutely.<eos> All right, then.<eos> So what about you?<eos> Where's the coffee?<eos> Over there.<eos> That means you're staying?<eos> It means I want a cup of coffee.<eos> Are those pills working?<eos> Not as fast as the morphine, or nearly as fun, but...<eos> They're okay.
Your nation attacked the Chechen people without provocation.<eos> We were soldiers.<eos> Our leaders sent us to fight, we fought.<eos> "Just following orders" is not good enough anymore.<eos> Bardov raped and butchered a group of 15-year-old and 16-year-old girls.<eos> No one ever raped them.<eos> That was a lie.<eos> And you called them "girls"?<eos> They were snipers.<eos> They killed dozens of our men.
They're killing them.<eos> I wanna help, but I can't move.<eos> The past cannot be changed.<eos> Yours is only to witness.<eos> Calm yourself.<eos> Calm yourself.<eos> I know where she is.<eos> I owe you an apology.<eos> Look, I can't explain what you did back there, okay?<eos> These visions of yours, if they are somehow connected to rea...

Emma, I just wanted to tell you that I appreciate you letting me stay here.<eos> Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's okay.<eos> I feel so responsible for everything that happened with Dan.<eos> Ethan, it was, it was really wrong of me to ask you to not tell him about Ted.<eos> I did what I did because I wanted to help you.<eos> Why?<eos> You said it yourself.<eos> Emma, even though we're not together anymore, what we had meant everything to me.<eos> In some ways it still does.<eos> I... I wish things could go back to the way they were.
And I know for the rest of my life, there won't be!<eos> And there's nothing that I want to do more right now than to come clean about everything, not just the money.<eos> What else is there?<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Please?<eos> I can't!<eos> Right now I can't.<eos> - and I owe it to our daughters to keep it. - Our daughters?<eos> - Yes!<eos> - What do they have to do with this?
I've already set some humane traps. (Clatter)<eos> (Laughs) Humane traps?<eos> Rats laugh at humane traps, George.<eos> And the only way to silence their laughter... poison gas.<eos> - Poison gas?<eos> - (Laughs) Okay.<eos> I... I won't be using poison gas.<eos> Don't go all wobbly on me now, George.<eos> I recently purchased a case of rat bombs from Australia on eBay. (Sniffles)<eos> Technically, they're "illegal" here, but they can take out a full-grown wallaby in under 30 seconds.
Hello, artifact.<eos> Window shopper!<eos> Are you sure this is the place?<eos> According to my new pal Doris, he was buying an elephant on the 4th Street Bridge.<eos> And I quote, "I know.<eos> It's weird, ain't it?"<eos> Pete, it looks like we're too late.<eos> Electric burns, just like Carson.<eos> Pete, look at that.<eos> The scratches-- they look like they were made by fingernails.
Look darling, Dag Hammarskjöld, he's a great man.<eos> You know who he is?<eos> Who is he?<eos> He works at the United Nations, he's like a secretary.<eos> Yes, secretary-general to be precise.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I am going to get you a tutor while you're here.<eos> No, tutors are boring.<eos> Well...<eos> I like things just the way they are.
Okay, don't start. I only slept for, like, 20 minutes.<eos> Emily:<eos> Why do you keep looking out there?<eos> Because Wilden knows I'm staying here.<eos> That's what you're thinking about?<eos> I'm having dreams about our friend having her head shaved, and you're looking...<eos> I have lots of other things that are keeping me up at night, okay Emily?<eos> If that car I dunked suddenly learns how to float, then...<eos> If Wilden's looking for his car, then he's not "A."<eos> Okay, besides cars don't float, if they did, pilgrims could have driven here.
Here.<eos> My parents told all of their friends that I went to Radley for exhaustion, so they want to throw a soiree to make sure that everybody knows that I'm all better now.<eos> Could really use some support.<eos> Can you guys please come?<eos> Of course.<eos> Yeah, you know we'd do anything for you.<eos> I'm counting on that.<eos> We like your plan.<eos> You'll get your reward Friday.<eos> Those bitches are finally going to get what they deserve.
No, we're not.<eos> Nothing about us feels right anymore.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> I want to fix this.<eos> I know.<eos> I know, but you can't.<eos> Okay, we've been chasing after what we used to have ever since you found out about Malcolm, but...<eos> I just don't... I don't think that we can ever get that back.<eos> Things aren't easy, but they can still be good.
Don't tell me you'd hit that?<eos> I live in the present, not in the past.<eos> Besides, she used to have a dick, and so she knows what it likes.<eos> What'd you guys do about pussy in Iraq anyway?<eos> Did you fuck camels?<eos> I was in Afghanistan.<eos> And you don't go anywhere near the camels, 'cause sometimes they strap them up with explosives and run them into camp and...<eos> And if you try to have sex with the girls there, their village throws rocks at 'em till they die, so there's not a lot going on.<eos> Plus, they're all dressed like beekeepers.<eos> Occasionally, a Russian hooker comes through, but those girls are nasty and they cry a lot.

Olivia!<eos> Did you do this? Worked for you.<eos> Okay, I need your keys.<eos> I got to get out of here.<eos> - Come back inside.<eos> - Where are your keys?<eos> - Just come back inside.<eos> - Stop.<eos> I'm not messing around.<eos> Where are they?

As soon as we match his profile to our two crime scenes, we got him.<eos> And you really went to this guy for therapy?<eos> What'd you tell him?<eos> (SIGHS) Enough.<eos> Now we make him talk.<eos> Thanks for coming down to the station, Dr. Marsh.<eos> I was hoping you could shed some light on a couple of open investigations I have going right now.<eos> Certainly.<eos> Two people killed by acts of vengeance.<eos> Both of them killed in the exact same way that they killed someone else.
I don't care what kind of half-arsed tinker operation you have going here.<eos> But I can assure you, I represent a very different category of organization.<eos> My cousin was shot.<eos> I am judge, jury and executioner.<eos> I find you guilty and I pass sentence.<eos> You deliver the guns to me or I deliver death and hell's fury to you and your little tribe of heathens.<eos> Am I making myself clear?<eos> Let me confess something to you.<eos> And only to you.<eos> I have the guns... ..but they have become a burden to me.
Issued by the board of control.<eos> The Shelby family has its first legal racetrack pitch.<eos> CHEERING<eos> We're a business, Pol.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> There you go.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> 30, 40, 50...<eos> These cigarettes have a strange smell, Arthur.<eos> They smell like rotting water.

(Laughter)<eos> Oh!<eos> I just realized.<eos> I hate you.<eos> (Scoffs)<eos> (Whispers) You can't be rude to my friends!<eos> Oh, come on, June.<eos> These girls are a joke.<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> Okay, maybe they're not perfect, but you don't want to be my friend, and they wanna be my friends, and I wanna drink cappuccinos on the sidewalk.

What do you... what do you even mean?<eos> I mean, those girls are exactly the reason why I don't hang out with girls.<eos> They're competitive, they backstab, and they post group pictures of themselves on Facebook so they can show the world what they look like in a bikini.
Half an hour every Saturday does not count.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> You prepare a trip to Brazil?<eos> No, my back.<eos> - Girls, you are wise with uncle.<eos> Their father is not fucking to keep them, while it has a two week to kiss.<eos> Hush, anyway.<eos> They know that their parent is an asshole like all men family.
Sorry.<eos> Anyway, so, London.<eos> Supposed to be the city of opportunity, right?<eos> But, actually, only gets you the opportunity to get fucked in the arse.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I mean, Boris bikes?<eos> They're lovely, aren't they?<eos> Thank you, Mr Boris.<eos> Thank you, Barclays Bank.<eos> But, those saddles, they're not really for girls, are they?
- Maybe he's growing more confident.<eos> - He called her a doll.<eos> You think that connects to the toys he brings?<eos> Well, he does seem to like dark-haired, petite women.<eos> Oh great, I'm his type.<eos> Uh-huh, you're right up there in his snack bracket.<eos> Maybe he uses the plush animals to recreate his childhood bedroom.<eos> If the toys don't watch, he can't get it up?<eos> No, he told Kate he'd been watching her, so we know he stakes out his victims...<eos> They've always been home alone.
You guys find anything?<eos> Not so far.<eos> Where is she with the profiling?<eos> Well, the human sexuality, it's complicated.<eos> It's not one size fits all.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> OK.<eos> He told Kate Fincher that he'd been watching her.<eos> Been watching - as in, for a while.<eos> OK, so we know that he stakes out his victims to make sure that they're alone...
- And she didn't report it until now?<eos> - Apparently she had work to do.<eos> Or she was in shock.<eos> No sign of violence, no bruising or tearing... traces of semen?<eos> That doesn't sound like our guy.<eos> I know it was the Riverdale Rapist.<eos> Did you read about him in the paper?<eos> Yeah, there's been about three, right?<eos> Or... four.<eos> (sighing) I know that women get raped every day, but not by a man in a ski mask, and not when they climb into your own bed.
- You survived.<eos> I've even had self-defence lessons.<eos> He attacked you when you were sleeping in the night.<eos> Nothing can prepare you for that.<eos> Sydney read about the Riverdale case and some of the details fed into her distorted memory.<eos> So she wasn't assaulted?<eos> She was, just by somebody else.<eos> No forced entry, no signs of a struggle.<eos> So what about fingerprints?<eos> They're not in the system.
- Your liar for hire, you mean.<eos> - I'll tell him you said hi.<eos> Gary Lewis, career sexual sadist.<eos> We picked him up on a parole violation for chatting up minors in a café.<eos> - Does the victimology line up?<eos> - Could do - he's a hebephile.<eos> He likes teenage girls with childlike bodies.<eos> - Yeah, like little dolls.<eos> - What's the M.O.?<eos> Breaks in at night, wears a ski mask, assaults the girls when they're home alone.
I've been close to death.<eos> On the island...<eos> More times than I can remember, and I never feared it.<eos> 'Cause I had nothing to lose.<eos> But when that archer almost killed me;<eos> when I... stared death in the face then,<eos> I thought about all the people that I've let into my life since I've been back.<eos> My family, Laurel, Tommy.<eos> And that made me afraid.<eos> Afraid of what would happen to those people if they lost me--again.
Just wanted to take some things for a memorial at the school.<eos> From Lindsay's room.<eos> I'm just gonna look for anything out of place.<eos> You won't find anything.<eos> What?<eos> That could be anything.<eos> Contact lens solution.<eos> It's not contact lens solution, Beth.<eos> Three girls they come up here, they've got a crazy plan.<eos> They're nervous... they've got a bottle of vodka in their backpack and a cop downstairs.

You're obviously not afraid that you're boring.<eos> What are the events in life?<eos> It's like you see a door.<eos> The first time you come to it you say,<eos> "Oh, what's on the other side of the door?"<eos> Then you open a few doors.<eos> Then you say, "I think I want to go over that bridge this time.<eos> I'm tired of doors." Finally you go through one of these things and you come out the other side and you realize that's all there are-- doors and windows and bridges and gates.<eos> And they all open the same way and they all close behind you.<eos> Look, life is supposed to be a path and you go along and these things happen to you and they're supposed to change you.
I've seen the pictures.<eos> Oh, you're Maeve's daughter?<eos> Oh, Grace, I'm so sorry to hear about...<eos> Thanks.<eos> I didn't know her.<eos> So, Lucy's something else, huh?<eos> I only hope Javier appreciates it.<eos> Javier?<eos> Don't get me wrong, he's handsome in a silver fox kind of way, and you know, there's the whole mansion-on-the-harbour thing, but would you date someone who didn't like ballet?<eos> We've looked closely at your grades, Mr Reed, and I have to say, for a scholarship student, they fluctuate rather alarmingly.
Sitting right there in Charlie Strong's yard.<eos> Tell me you threw them in the cut.<eos> We put 'em in the stables, out of the rain.<eos> The guns hadn't been greased yet.<eos> So that's why they sent a copper from Belfast.<eos> Maybe, maybe not.<eos> Thomas, you're a bookmaker, a robber, a fighting man, you're not a fool.<eos> You sell those guns to anyone who has use to 'em, you will hang!<eos> Dump them somewhere the police can find them.<eos> Maybe if they know they haven't fallen into the wrong hands this might blow over.
I have what you're looking for.<eos> I have the guns.<eos> What guns?<eos> I'm not here to play games...<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> 25 Lewis machine guns, 50 carbines, 10,000 rounds of ammunition - all in a crate bound for Libya, stolen from the BSA factory proofing bay.<eos> I'm guessing they sent you to Birmingham to get those guns back.<eos> Well, it's me that has them.<eos> I have left word with men I trust that if I am taken into police custody for whatever reason, those guns will be shipped to Liverpool.<eos> From there they will be sent directly to Belfast and sold to the Irish Republican Army.
Circuit training.<eos> Then I have modeling, jump rope club,<eos> - nude modeling.<eos> - Fine.<eos> What does your Friday look like?<eos> Mm! Boy band practice.<eos> Seems like you got a pretty full plate.<eos> Yeah. I need 30 grams of animal protein at every single meal.<eos> No, I meant to say that your days are totally and completely booked.<eos> They're overbooked.
Tessa!<eos> Look.<eos> The phones work.<eos> I thought they were just props.<eos> And we've got caller number one.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Body?<eos> Please talk to my glutes.<eos> They're all ears.
I don't know.<eos> Um, I guess... that I will try to remember... the things that we talked about.<eos> The tools...<eos> that I learned here.<eos> Not to mention the tools you met here.<eos> What coping mechanisms come to mind?<eos> Um... one day at a time... and all that.<eos> Uh... meditation, scheduling,<eos> - asking for help.<eos> - We talked about really slowing things down so that they're not so overwhelming.
That's all it takes, that's all it takes<eos> A little love, a little honey<eos> A little sunshine for his rainbows<eos> A little sand for his castles<eos> And all the crayons he needs to draw<eos> That's all it takes, that's all it takes<eos> Well, sonny, you took your time.<eos> Did you see your mum?<eos> All right... I've put together a selection.<eos> If your aunts question you at Gestapo HQ upstairs, they'll think you were at the market.
Positive thinking.<eos> You'll make it happen, Miss Mardle.<eos> I'm sure we can make space for gloves in Fashion, Miss Mardle.<eos> I'll see what we can do in the morning.<eos> That's very kind of you, Miss Bunting.<eos> We all have to pull together.<eos> The inner workings of the boudoir for everyone to see.<eos> You think it'll work?<eos> Of course it will!<eos> Women want to make themselves beautiful for men, and men want to see how they do it.
You're very fond of him, aren't you?<eos> Are you one of 'those kind of men'?<eos> I have friends in the theatre who are -<eos> No, Miss Love.<eos> I am not one of 'those kind of men'.<eos> Then what are you, exactly?<eos> A perfectionist.<eos> But so am I!<eos> Which is why I had to speak out about the photographs.<eos> They didn't show ME!
Don't give Miss Ravillious anything from accessories, unless I say so.<eos> Is that understood?<eos> Yes, Miss Mardle.<eos> Sorry, Miss Mardle.<eos> Now, you heard Mr Selfridge, any ideas, ladies, before Miss Ravillious gets in there first and shows us up...<eos> Great idea, Miss Ravillious.<eos> All we have to do is add the white braiding to our existing capes.<eos> See?<eos> How quickly can this be done?<eos> I'll get the seamstresses to do what they can today then, if they sell, we can put them on shifts through the night to be ready for tomorrow. Excellent.
She has no media access.<eos> I hope you're right.<eos> Amanda Porter kills her husband and his mistress in a single act of rage.<eos> How does she escalate to mission killer on a murder spree?<eos> You got add the cult component.<eos> This his her chapter of Joe Carroll's playbook.<eos> I mean, look at these murders.<eos> They're public statements. This guy is big on theatrics.<eos> Look at the weapons.<eos> They're like props... spear gun, garrote, even he uses an ice pick.
'Cause I'm on my period, which kind of sucks but...<eos> Probably, but it's totally worth it.<eos> You're making the best of it.<eos> They look great.<eos> Okay, I have to pee like a mother fucking race horse.<eos> I do, too.<eos> Why do they even say "I have to pee like a race horse"?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't get that, like... Do race horses just, like, have to pee all the time.<eos> I don't get it. Because they're always racing and they never get to pee.
And according to some liar on Yelp, one of my fake nails.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Normal people just don't realize the sacrifices we make for our art.<eos> God, you two are smug.<eos> Is this the gasoline talking?<eos> I mean, let's not forget the dynamic here.<eos> You think I'm perfect.<eos> I remember.<eos> But listen up.<eos> If you're one of the few people on this earth that actually loves what they do, you don't ever rub that in anyone's face.
No, he's not, but... what does he need?<eos> There was another murder last night, the vargulf.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> Peter said you were some kind of expert.<eos> So how is this happening?<eos> You really have no idea what you are, do you?<eos> What the fuck's that supposed to mean?<eos> OK.<eos> First... experts are the people that you see on TV.<eos> And the laws of magic are like the laws of anything, they work because you obey them.
I believe that the majority of them were not people<eos> Who wanted the old regime<eos> And were not people who wanted the Brotherhood.<eos> I am so fucking scared of the moment, a lieutenant or a brigadier general<eos> Enough of this.<eos> All the politicians are failures.<eos> The Muslim Brothers, the Salafis, the Socialists,<eos> The Liberals, they're all failures.<eos> I've decided to walk in the middle of the street.<eos> The cars can do whatever they want.

Oh, so that's the Guardian Angel.<eos> So he says.<eos> Yeah, ten million bucks is chump change for that guy.<eos> Yeah, right?<eos> He probably spends that on hair gel.<eos> DANVILLE:<eos> I don't know. Feels more like strategy to me than charity.<eos> You think?<eos> (crowd chatter, Kemp laughs)<eos> These things are never how they look.
Thanks.<eos> So what's with all the stuffed animals?<eos> Are they real?<eos> They were once.<eos> My dad does it.<eos> He's one of the best taxidermy artists on the west coast.<eos> But enough about stuffing dead animals.<eos> Sit down.<eos> I'm gonna tell you a little story about real, living things.<eos> Four girls from Shunyi, China, get told that, if they come to America illegally and work as housemaids, they will get citizenship in seven years.

She's got a spring in her step again. (Growls)<eos> I haven't seen her go that hard since she was a puppy.<eos> Really?<eos> Ugh. No wonder why I was feeling body ache, chills, and a loose stool coming on.<eos> I knew it was either George Altman or a parasitic tapeworm.<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> I forgot.<eos> Same thing. Burn.<eos> I've been taking the girls on some walks, spending a little quality time with the both of them.<eos> And they have never been happier.
Yes, she was at her grief support group at the willamette community center.<eos> Can I go to the hospital now, please?<eos> - We have her number?<eos> - Yeah, got 'em.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Something you might want to see inside.<eos> Same M.O. Gets himself invited in for coffee, then blinds them with something.<eos> He picked up both women at grief support meetings.<eos> He knows they're vulnerable.
I know it didn't work.<eos> Made the "Woops" column in Poof.<eos> It's cool, though, man;<eos> I've been there.<eos> Your assistant probably sabotaged you.<eos> I don't even use one anymore.<eos> I resorted to using my own legs in the "Saw the Lady in Half" gag.<eos> I even shaved them.<eos> Want to feel?<eos> Wow, they are smooth.
"K..." [Ride Of The Valkyries plays]<eos> Oh, "Kill The Wabbit."<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> I got you.<eos> Of course, Orville Wright's aviator goggles.<eos> Take 'em off!<eos> Artie, come on.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause if I'm right, they belong to the less talented of the Wright Brothers who imbued them with the ability to steal other people's brainpower... never mind.
Previously on Defiance...<eos> These visions of yours, if they are somehow connected...
Previously on Defiance...<eos> These visions of yours, if they are somehow connected...<eos> "If"?<eos> They are real.
We would protect you from any any all enemies.<eos> Gin?<eos> What enemies?<eos> I would hate to see this town torn apart by alien barbarians.<eos> We're pretty good with alien barbarians.<eos> It's kind of our thing.<eos> Defiance could use a friend like the Earth Republic.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> "I took her hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place, and as the morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge, so the evening mists were rising now.<eos> And in all the broad expanse of tranquil light they showed to me, I saw no shadow of another parting from her."
You hear that?<eos> Yeah, Danny, I hear it.<eos> I have ears.<eos> It's a reasonable question.<eos> Shh, shh, shh.<eos> It's coming from behind this bookcase.<eos> Lock's busted.<eos> Hydroponic grow room.<eos> Lights are on timers.<eos> They must have been off when HPD did their sweep.
Thanks.<eos> Oh, here, wait.<eos> Really?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Should we call someone and, well, tell them that you're okay?<eos> No, I don't wanna talk to any of them again, ever.<eos> Well, don't you have questions?<eos> Yeah, I have, like, a million questions, but...<eos> Oh, I don't know that there are any answers that are gonna make me feel better.<eos> What if they, uh... you know, what if they make me feel worse?
You got no idea the trouble you're in.<eos> Transporting a minor across state lines, shoplifting, home invasion.<eos> And with your record, you're looking at five years.<eos> Now turn around.<eos> Deputy... I wonder if I might have a word with that young man.<eos> Come on.<eos> Sure thing, Senator.<eos> You can stay here as long as you want to.<eos> The guest towels are, uh...<eos> - They're...
But we're not going to work.<eos> Do you know what used to be here?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Just a mountain and some goats... and a shack my father grew up in with six brothers and three sisters.<eos> Now there are three hotels that all belong to my family.<eos> As a child I always played with the kid next door, Frank.<eos> We hadn't been in the Netherlands long.<eos> Frank and I would play soccer.<eos> Or with those little balls...<eos> What are they called?

Hands on your head.<eos> Hands on your head.<eos> Look down.<eos> Look down.<eos> Keys.<eos> - I don't have them.<eos> Where are the keys?<eos> - I don't have them.<eos> Don't act tough.<eos> Where are they?
And by "us," I mean me.<eos> Thank you, little miss sensitivity.<eos> Ohh.<eos> All right. What's wrong with you?<eos> I feel like my arm's about to fall off.<eos> It's peckeritis.<eos> Is that really a thing?<eos> [ Laughing ] Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> You know how some supermarket cashiers get carpal tunnel from working the register, except they're making change, and you're making, well... Really?
Listen, sweetness.<eos> You couldn't do me a favour, could you?<eos> I've been quarantined against me will.<eos> You mangy cow!<eos> Call yourself a Christian!<eos> Once the dead have been judged, only then can the good Lord pave the way to salvation.<eos> And salvation is all that we crave.<eos> Amen.<eos> Do not be fooled.<eos> Those things are not what they appear to be.
This seems like private family business.<eos> I-I agree with you. DALE:<eos> ...over a pair of jean shorts.<eos> Forget that.<eos> This talking to your brother thing... that is still happening.<eos> (sighs): I guess so.<eos> Come on, you'll do great.<eos> I have faith in you.<eos> (whispers): Celebrities:<eos> they're just like us.

I am an adult, Becca.<eos> I can use the whole night.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> See, I thought this was one of those situations where I did one thing wrong, you did one thing wrong, but now it turns out that I did two things wrong, and... you did no things wrong.<eos> Yup.<eos> You know, my pregnancy is really taking a toll on me, and my hormones,<eos> Really?<eos> Really?<eos> they're just acting like
Foreign Accent Syndrome.<eos> Right.<eos> So, not British.<eos> Not a subject of the crown, as they say.<eos> A right Colonial, I am...<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Stop.<eos> You still have migraines?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> They're awful, sometimes.
You're just finally feeling something.<eos> Feeling like the real you.<eos> I got up for the gym.<eos> Are you driving today?<eos> What?<eos> Can I borrow the keys to your car?<eos> Use your own car.<eos> I can't find my keys.<eos> Did you check the thing where they always are?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I checked the thing where they always are.
She's always just-- she's very old.<eos> She just stands there just being old,<eos> And the dog just fights gravity every day, just--<eos> The two of them, it's really--<eos> The dog's got a cloudy eye, and she's got a cloudy eye, And they just stand there looking at the street In two dimensions together, and--<eos> And she's always wearing, like, this old sweater dress.<eos> I guess it was a sweater when she was, like, 5'10",<eos> But now it's just, like, this sweater<eos> And her legs are-- her legs are a nightmare.<eos> They're just white with green streaks and bones sticking out.
That's it, just our own heart going, "dude, I can't--<eos> "you can't keep doing this.<eos> I told you three strokes ago that this is not smart,"<eos> But women still--<eos> "yeah. I'll go out with you alone at night."<eos> What are you, nuts?<eos> "I'll get in your car with you with my little shoulders.<eos> Hi. Where are we going?"<eos> "to your death, statistically."<eos> How do they still do it?
A guy on a first date just has no actual personality.<eos> He's just a mishmash Of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each, Just anything, no cohesive--<eos> Just, you know, "well...<eos> "ha ha!<eos> "well, yes. I think so, too.<eos> Ha ha!<eos> Rrgh..."<eos> Whatever, just like a blind dick in space Just thrusting in infinite directions Hoping to find pay dirt at someplace,<eos> And then sometimes you see a date That's later down the line and something has happened.<eos> There's something that happens in a date That I never get to witness 'cause women do this. They get to do it inside.

They get to do it inside.<eos> They get to just decide quietly, "I'm gonna let him fuck me."<eos> They just get to decide.
He's still, like, trying all this shit.<eos> He still has no idea he's already in there.<eos> Guys are--<eos> We love women a lot-- all men do-- And we just look at you.<eos> That's what I do. I just look at women.<eos> I just--""<eos> Like they're, you know, cakes in windows.<eos> I just--""<eos> I was walking in new york once, And there's these two very cute women walking behind me, And I was trying to walk slowly so I could hear<eos> What they were saying to each other, you know, 'cause they were cute, so I wanted to hear them,
How about a camera?<eos> You see anyone with a camera?<eos> Nope.<eos> You have not observed or participated in any inappropriate activity<eos> or relation with an inmate?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Because, in here, inappropriate can mean a smile at the wrong time, Bennett.<eos> These women are hungry, if you get my meaning.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> They want sex, is what I mean.
Black ladies just run against the other black ladies.<eos> My competition is Pennsatucky.<eos> But it don't matter, because Red's gonna make all the white girls vote for me.<eos> So, you only run against white people.<eos> You can only vote within your race or your group.<eos> Look, just pretend it's the 1950s.<eos> It makes it easier to understand.<eos> See, everyone elects a representative from their own tribe.<eos> White, black, Hispanic, golden girls, others.<eos> And those five gals, they meet with Healy, they tell him what we want, then he speaks to the higher-ups.
Oh, I'm sorry I missed that.<eos> Really?<eos> Are you Catholic?<eos> No!<eos> But...<eos> Well, I think a lot about overcoming sin.<eos> And I just love Jesus Christ.<eos> And I've always wanted to try one of those communion wafers.<eos> Well, I have a box of a thousand.<eos> They're not as fresh as the ones you get outside of prison, but they're good with dip.
But, oh, well.<eos> So, what?<eos> You're just gonna give up?<eos> Huh?<eos> Just because of a little competition?<eos> That chicken is out there, Red, and it's waiting for you.<eos> To eat it.<eos> And you have been waiting for a very long time to eat it.<eos> What do those other girls have that you don't have?<eos> They have dogs.
The two of us, strong together.<eos> Like back then.<eos> Like always.<eos> I love you.<eos> You know I love you.<eos> Shh. Will you stay with me?<eos> Stuart's office is next door to Petros Pictures.<eos> It must be the next door.<eos> These are surveillance cameras.<eos> Yeah, and they all show places around the studio.
AND THESE LITTLE THINGS HELP KEEP HER STRONG.<eos> Linor: NUR'S PAROLE HEARING IS COMING UP AGAIN.<eos> THEY NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE OTHER VICTIMS ... THE WOMEN BEFORE ME WHO TRIED TO GET HIM CONVICTED BUT THE COURTS DIDN'T BELIEVE THEM.<eos> Woman: HELLO, LINOR ABARGIL.<eos> HELLO.<eos> YOU ARE SEARCHING FOR ADDITIONAL VICTIMS OF THE SAME MAN WHO RAPED YOU.<eos> I'M TRYING TO FIND TWO GIRLS WHO PRESSED CHARGES AGAINST HIM.<eos> AS FAR AS I KNOW, HE WAS ACQUITTED IN BOTH CASES.<eos> I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO TRACK THEM DOWN.<eos> IF THEY HEAR THIS, I HOPE THEY WILL CONTACT ME THROUGH THE WEBSITE.
We read about the Salem Witch Trials in, like, fifth grade.<eos> Guess I should have paid more attention.<eos> Hang her!<eos> Drown her!<eos> Burn her!<eos> Mercy Osbourne, you have been sentenced to death.<eos> May God have mercy on your wretched soul.<eos> Those girls weren't even witches.<eos> The real witches were cunning and careful not to be caught.<eos> In fact after that, they got the hell out of Dodge.

Spike is great Making a jewel cake<eos> Me, that's who.<eos> Been saving up my gems So fine<eos> For a cake That is divine<eos> Who are you quot;hooingquot; at?<eos> I know. They're delicious.
Yeah, I got a lead on our body from a Metro missing persons report.<eos> Same build and bone structure.<eos> Hairline and color match. Looks like our lobe-less victim.<eos> Tyler Wilkes was reported missing this morning, by his lawyer.<eos> Wilkes. That sounds familiar.<eos> His investigative reports have been published all over the world.<eos> So he's a journalist. He's more like<eos> - a government paparazzi. - So instead of looking for photos of Kate Middleton with her top off, he's trying to catch the Pentagon with their pants down?<eos> He sold photographs of opium smuggling on foreign Army bases last year.<eos> They turned out to be digitally altered, right?
It's not like anyone ever expected me to be relationship material.<eos> Well, not with a woman, because... you're not a lesbian.<eos> It shouldn't matter, Harry.<eos> It does.<eos> No, but it shouldn't.<eos> I'm supposed to be this sexually liberated free spirit, and... maybe it's all just a load of crap.<eos> Maybe I'm actually a self-destructive, emotionally stunted idiot.<eos> Maybe you're both.<eos> Seriously, I will puke on your face.<eos> Uh, you do have a tendency to make things harder than they need to be, Joss, but that's what your 20s are about, I suppose.
You believe in Jack Klein?<eos> Yes.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I believe he is a self-serving hustler that would kill his own mother - to get in the Governor's mansion. - Hmm.<eos> - Look, Danny, you have always seen the world as--<eos> - What?<eos> Black and white?<eos> Good and evil?<eos> No, you're wrong.<eos> I see things as they are.
Move it along!<eos> Get the ball, Dick!<eos> That's it!<eos> Way to go, Dick!<eos> You almost made contact that time, buddy!<eos> Thanks.<eos> Felt great, coach.<eos> Yeah, not David Beckham.<eos> Remember, you are stronger than these women, Debbie Weaver.<eos> They must do your bidding or feel your wrath.
I'll bury him in the morning.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I've seen this look.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> You want a drink?<eos> You want to go upstairs... and break a headboard again?<eos> Not tonight.<eos> You're in a mood.<eos> Things are different... that's all... with Joe here.<eos> They're supposed to be.
Uhh!<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I look over, and Pretty Boy here is bawling his eyes out.<eos> It was a 4-hanky film.<eos> He had to borrow tissues from the old lady next to us.<eos> I'm not afraid to show emotions, so I cried.<eos> I think it's kind of sweet.<eos> Besides, tears are cathartic.<eos> They are a purgative.

How much anxiety could a girl have?<eos> See, these pills are more to manage her behavior than to treat any illness.<eos> Right, but the question is, what's she got?<eos> And without her medical records, we're in the dark.<eos> Nothing in the DSM requires all these.<eos> Could the drugs themselves be making her crazy?<eos> Given to someone who doesn't need them, yeah. Absolutely.<eos> Okay, well, she's had 10 units of blood to help deal with the hemorrhaging.<eos> Most of these drugs should have washed out of her system.<eos> But the Pams are metabolized through fat cells, so they take a little longer to clear.
It's hard to tell.<eos> Anything retroperitoneal I usually refer immediately.<eos> Could it be Castleman's disease?<eos> No.<eos> He has no history of H.I.V. or herpes.<eos> What about Desmoid tumors?<eos> Aren't Desmoids super rare?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But if it is Desmoid tumors and we cut...<eos> They'll multiply.
But to tell you the truth, Tandy,<eos> I'm not even sure I should try and stop her.<eos> Hey, darlin'.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Why don't you sit up here?<eos> Seats are all taken, Cy.<eos> Not this one.<eos> Really?<eos> Now you're gonna get much better stories out of him than me.<eos> I mean, they're not true, but they're good.
I was grateful.<eos> And, you know, it got me thinking about, um... Just all this, what we're doing.<eos> And I think we just need to be honest with each other.<eos> 'Cause I don't think this is about what's been going on the last few weeks.<eos> I think it's what's been going on the last few years.<eos> I, you know, I love you.<eos> I've always loved you.<eos> I just don't know that, um, I just don't know that I'm happy.<eos> I don't know that you're happy, either, if we're really being honest.<eos> But our girls love their parents, and they don't know what's going on with us, and they don't know what's going on in this marriage, and it... it needs to stay that way.

And he's on board with that?<eos> He's working it out.<eos> Okay, probably better that way.<eos> What about Adalind?<eos> She wants the key.<eos> For my brother.<eos> Why don't you give it to her?<eos> Because I trust you more than I trust my family.<eos> There's way too much at stake to let either one of them have it.<eos> And the families, they'll stop at nothing until they get their hands on those keys.
Well, maybe not.<eos> Look. Check it out.<eos> It's Beau.<eos> You--you see that?<eos> He--he turns his head like he sees something or someone.<eos> And it's at 11:50.<eos> That's right around the time of the murder.<eos> Look.<eos> He walks right by those women.<eos> They're watching him go.
We have a peer worker, Liz Birdsworth, she'll introduce you to the women.<eos> When can I talk to my daughter?<eos> All numbers have to be put on a call list.<eos> I'll organise it. You can call her after lunch.<eos> Thanks, Vera.<eos> It's Miss Bennett.<eos> Hi.<eos> This front door gets locked every night, but feel free to move around the unit.<eos> With the other women?<eos> They're not locked in their cells?
Yeah, but<eos> - Do you?<eos> Anyone waiting?<eos> What for?<eos> Red is in no hurry. Bring 'em in.<eos> Oh.<eos> Look, Red,<eos> I'm all about fun, the girls know that.<eos> It's how things work in my unit.<eos> They also know that if want to survive in here, if they want to eat, sleep or... speak to their kids, they'll do what I say.
Well, you can't smoke in here.<eos> So, how long will I be in here?<eos> It's up to the Governor.<eos> Is this the good-cop routine?<eos> I'm not a cop.<eos> Look, between me and you, you're doing the right thing.<eos> They'll keep grilling you.<eos> That's nothing to what the women will do to you if you talk.<eos> The Governor said that I'd be safe, I'd be in protection.<eos> If they want to get to someone, they do it, even if it's just in here.
No-one's going to pay to see your gash here.<eos> Miss Davidson?<eos> Um... I want to know if Toni is OK.<eos> No-one's telling me anything.<eos> Yeah. She's being looked after.<eos> You've seen her, have you?<eos> I just want to know if she's all right.<eos> The wet cells aren't built for comfort, Doreen.<eos> Oh, Miss Davidson, I'm sorry.<eos> The women come out worse than they went in.
She's fine.<eos> You won't choke.<eos> I've seen it before.<eos> You can't kill yourself with a cheese roll, Toni.<eos> Get it out.<eos> She tried to choke herself.<eos> In those conditions, is it any wonder?<eos> Well, the whole purpose of the wet cells is to isolate the women and to prevent self-harm.<eos> What about their human rights?<eos> They don't have a proper bed, they can't shower or brush their teeth.
'After six years, things have changed.'<eos> 'And I finally have a family.'<eos> 'And it's all because of one person.'<eos> 'I haven't been in the slot for over six months.'<eos> The governor and I have organised this event but it's us women that made it happen.<eos> 'I've changed.' I've changed.<eos> I've changed.<eos> So, I want everyone to be clear about how things will run today.<eos> Liz has organised the women.<eos> The women have been instructed about what they can speak about.

Are you volunteering?<eos> For a price.<eos> Information.<eos> It must be frustrating not knowing.<eos> You didn't find anything in my room, did you?<eos> Just tell me what you know about the riot.<eos> Which one of you guys killed my wife?<eos> What makes you think it was one of us?<eos> How are the women doing after this morning?<eos> Well, they hate it when a kid's used like that.
You know, I see today as an opportunity to take everyone's mind off it.<eos> This is something positive.<eos> What about Franky?<eos> Is she still on board?<eos> She's the one drawing the crowd.<eos> You said she'd speak, Liz.<eos> She changed her mind.<eos> Come on.<eos> Focus on the other women.<eos> Make sure they're ready.

Take your hand off the door, please.<eos> She laid the boot in.<eos> Running won't solve it. That's enough.<eos> I was sure that, if I found the bracelet, I'd know who killed her.<eos> See how fucked it is?<eos> This whole thing has got me seeing stuff, wondering.<eos> And you're my best mate.<eos> But this...<eos> It's nothing.<eos> The women, they...

Oh, why don't you take it?<eos> I don't care!<eos> Maybe I will!<eos> You'll last five minutes!<eos> What?<eos> I said you won't last five minutes.<eos> Why is that, Liz?<eos> Why?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Because you're dumb and black and the women are never going to talk to you in the same way that they talk to me!
Is now a good time?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you reckon I'm a nice person, Bea?<eos> Yeah, course I do.<eos> Why?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> Yeah, just watching some telly.<eos> The women trust the peer worker, right?<eos> Well, they all trusted Liz.
No-one takes a hit out on Vinnie Holt and gets away with it.<eos> I'll rip his fucking heart out and shove it down his throat.<eos> I've enjoyed our little chat.<eos> Thank you, Governor.<eos> We'll run random spot checks through the day, every day.<eos> H2 and H4 are our main focus.<eos> We need to know where these women are at all times.<eos> Are you still feeling the love?<eos> It'll wear off.<eos> If they're in the visitors' centre, monitor them closely.
Make sure Bea gets this.<eos> We just don't think it's fair Bea can't go today and we want you to do something about it.<eos> I understand, Doreen but Bea is a Double A risk and... there are rules.<eos> Far out.<eos> It's her kid's funeral.<eos> She's not gonna go out and kill someone!<eos> I'm not gonna argue about this.<eos> You can't just brush us off!<eos> Miss Davidson, we know the rules are there for a reason.<eos> But it doesn't mean they're always right.

Hm.<eos> You busy tonight?<eos> No plans.<eos> We should have that beer.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Thanks for coming, everyone.<eos> Today is for Bea.<eos> To help her say goodbye to her daughter Debbie.<eos> You know, being in here, you get close to the other women.<eos> They're more than friends.

Can we talk about us?<eos> Fletch?<eos> Fuck off, Vera.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Liz Birdsworth to see you, Governor.<eos> OK, thank you.<eos> Liz?<eos> Liz, how can I help you?<eos> You said you wanted me to keep you updated on how the women are doing.<eos> Yes, how are they doing?
Maybe you should give them to her.<eos> Okay. Okay, no.<eos> You're right.<eos> You're right.<eos> It's just...<eos> I shouldn't have gotten roses, you know?<eos> That's, like, presumptuous.<eos> I, um... it's... ooh.<eos> I missed you. I missed you too.<eos> And I brought you some, uh... oh, they're beautiful.
Yeah, an investment when you know the payoff is not a risk, it's a sure thing.<eos> There are no sure things.<eos> Well then I'm happy with getting as close as I can.<eos> Where are we?<eos> It's all routine.<eos> They'll come for me.<eos> You know how all this plays out, Cameron.<eos> She hasn't told you, has she?<eos> How does she do it?<eos> It must suck to be you, always two steps behind her, almost like she can see things before they happen.
I'm probably just fooling myself.<eos> Maybe you need someone to show you that it is possible.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Simple.<eos> I provide you with a test to help determine whether the Queen can truly change.<eos> Why would I trust you when I know you want the Queen dead?<eos> You never make a deal without a price.<eos> Maybe I just want her alive.<eos> That I doubt.<eos> Question my motives all you like, dearie, but they shall remain mine.
I've already sent for my bags.<eos> Betty could put in a word here.<eos> Yeah except with so many girls out there,<eos> Mrs. Groot needs references.<eos> Former employers, landlords.<eos> I doubt my mother could find a good word.<eos> I'll ponder this over a bath.<eos> Sorry, thought I had the room to myself.<eos> I heard Dolores headed back to Guelph.<eos> A lot of these rookies don't know what they're in for.
His situation has further alarmed our friend in Detroit.<eos> His situation?<eos> The feds have him.<eos> Well, so what?<eos> He's not Drew Thompson.<eos> But he could have been.<eos> Theo wants Drew found now.<eos> A week ago, you said you would have him in a week.<eos> Well, things have gotten a little more complicated.<eos> They certainly have.
I think Boyd thinks so.<eos> Can't figure any other reason he'd be cozying up to them.<eos> Do you mind keeping eyes on them while we try to get our shit together around here?<eos> Be my pleasure.<eos> I wouldn't mind putting eyes on the widow.<eos> From what Raylan says, she's something to look at.<eos> Well, she's at the motel with her security detail, so I wouldn't go peeking in the windows if I was you.<eos> Why do the pretty ones always go for the bad boys?<eos> I ask myself that every day.<eos> I guess they think they can change us, right, Raylan?
Tell me why I'm here.<eos> I'll explain everything inside.<eos> Rachel, please stay out here with father zoller.<eos> I will not wait outside.<eos> What do you want with hank?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> Please, right this way.<eos> After almost a century, The 12 clocks are finally brought home.<eos> Together, they contain the route to the true cross.
Rosicrucians.<eos> "The pilgrim that would seek god<eos> "In eternity<eos> "Must see the two faces of time.<eos> How it is both stopped and moving at once."<eos> "In that combination lies the road to all that is holy."<eos> Right on the hour.<eos> After all these centuries, Still right on the hour.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> The figurines, who are they?
This one.<eos> I remember vincent wanted help with it.<eos> The gears, they were soldered.<eos> Soldered.<eos> Time stopped.<eos> Well, yeah, but they were all stopped, right?<eos> I mean, none of them actually worked anymore.<eos> Or maybe they were working<eos> Exactly as they were meant to.<eos> And the clocks in the cathedral, they're still moving.
Let's mingle while we're single.<eos> That's how the game starts.<eos> The game just officially started.<eos> That wasn't clear.<eos> Okay, so here are the basic rules of the game...<eos> Daniel cannot know you're competing for him.<eos> You will each go on five platonic dates.<eos> You will each get an interruption card, a cool-down card, and a monkey wrench card which can be played at any time.<eos> You had cards made up?<eos> Aren't they beautiful?
Yes, Tom?<eos> I have the sat phone up.<eos> It's President Langston.<eos> She would like to speak with President Grant.<eos> (Chair scrapes floor)<eos> Thank you.<eos> (Door closes, phone beeps)<eos> Sally, it's like a miracle.<eos> All our prayers, the prayers you so ably led the American people in...<eos> They've been answered.
I'm so sorry.<eos> I am.<eos> I know how you must feel, and I am so sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Really.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You don't have to apologize to me.<eos> I don't know what he'd do without you.<eos> I don't know what I would do without you.<eos> The trouble with precision air strikes is they're not precise.
Might as well come, too, I guess.<eos> What the hell? !<eos> God damn it, Rufus!<eos> Nice socks, Joey.<eos> Gold tips?<eos> All three of you, get the hell out of here now!<eos> It's all right, Joe.<eos> You mind if I call you Joe?<eos> I just got a couple questions, so if you want to let your friends collect themselves...<eos> They invited. You ain't.
To me, it had never crossed my mind that they might be moving the baby from her mom.<eos> The supervisors basically was kind of mocking me, like, "Oh, you're saying, 'Poor Kalina,"' you know, "'what's she going to do without her mommy?"'<eos> And, you know-- and that of course just shut me up.<eos> So, the night of the move, we had to deploy the nets to separate them and get Kalina, the baby, into the med pool.<eos> And Katina was generally a quiet whale.<eos> She was not an overly vocal whale.<eos> After, Kalina was removed from the scene and put on the truck and taken to the airport, and Katina, her mom, was left in the pool.<eos> She stayed in the corner of the pool, like, literally just shaking and screaming, screeching, crying.<eos> Like, I had never seen her do anything like that.<eos> And the other females in the pool, maybe once or twice during the night they'd come out and check on her.

Her arm, it was U-shaped.<eos> It was compound fractured.<eos> She's very lucky to be alive, that's for sure.<eos> I believe it's 70 plus, maybe even more, just killer whale trainer accidents.<eos> Maybe 30 of them happened prior to me being actually hired at Sea World.<eos> And I knew about none of them.<eos> I've seen animals come out at trainers.<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> I've seen people get slammed.<eos> The whales, they're just playing or-- or they're upset for a second.
And again, Sea World is saying it was not an aggressive move.<eos> One of Sea World's top curators, Chuck Tompkins, said when Dawn Brancheau was pulled off that ledge, it wasn't necessarily aggressive behavior by the whale.<eos> The initial grab was not an act of aggression.<eos> This is not a crazed animal.<eos> The industry has a vested interest in spinning these so that the animals continue to appear like cuddly teddy bears that are completely safe.<eos> You know, that sells a lot of Shamu dolls, it sells a lot of tickets at the gate, and that's the story line that they're going to continue to stick with for as long as they can.<eos> Recognize that those that say this is a crazed animal that acted out and grabbed Dawn maliciously, they want to prove the theorem that captivity makes animals crazy.<eos> And that is just false.<eos> All whales in captivity have a bad life.<eos> They're all emotionally destroyed.

Why would I do that?<eos> I'm telling you now because we have to deal with this, yeah?<eos> Beth was on this killer's hit list and, now, I am.<eos> Yeah? What am I supposed to do about it?<eos> How can I help?<eos> Be available.<eos> I may need you, somehow.<eos> Wow, rich, man.<eos> This looks like a new blade inset in a much older handle, so the fish is a bitch, semiotically speaking, like a universal wayback symbol of fecundity.<eos> But these wings, though, they're...
Not driving the nice new Jag today, then?<eos> - It's in the shop. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Are you going to let me see my daughter, or what?<eos> What are you gaping at?<eos> Something I can do?<eos> You ever fight a woman?<eos> Depends.<eos> Business or pleasure?<eos> Look, they do say crazy makes you strong.<eos> But women, they look different, fight different, smell different.
We've spotted the truck... a half a mile away and closing.<eos> Okay, kids, our target is closing.<eos> Let's rip some rubber.<eos> - Clocking him at 75.<eos> - That's fast.<eos> Yeah, it's way too fast for a truck carrying a pair of Lambos.<eos> That suspension's not compressed.<eos> Yeah, he's riding way too high.<eos> There's no way there's cars in there.<eos> No, no, no, they're in there, Paul.
I don't go to bat for liars, Lauren.<eos> You never went to that warehouse, you never saw those cars.<eos> You didn't know how many goddamn Russians were in there because you were never there.<eos> You almost got Johnny killed.<eos> You put this whole house in harm's way, and you know what the worst part is?<eos> You used me.<eos> You played... Me.<eos> Kusmanov never hit you.<eos> That's right. I saw his hands.<eos> Lauren, they were as smooth as butter.
Or... if there was a struggle, it could've come from the killer.<eos> Mandy's on the job.<eos> I know him.<eos> Tom Scola.<eos> He wanted to sell me a bottle of wine for $100,000.<eos> Let's see what else he tries to sell you.<eos> So, Tommy, here I thought you just worked for Albert Vogel, the auctioneer, but... guess what we found when we were processing Jack Davari's counterfeit operation.<eos> I don't know, but I'm sure you're gonna tell me.<eos> Your fingerprints.<eos> They were everywhere.
Please confirm where you're calling from.<eos> 1721 Hillcrest Drive.<eos> This can't be happening.<eos> What's your name, sir?<eos> Bruce.<eos> Bruce Morrison.<eos> How old are your daughters, Mr. Morrison?<eos> 13 and 17.<eos> When was the last time you saw them?<eos> They went to bed around 9:30.
That's a good idea.<eos> It looks like Katie stayed in a lot.<eos> She has a schedule of when she was gonna try new recipes.<eos> She seems like a really sweet girl.<eos> Her charger's here but the phone is not.<eos> Maybe it's with her?<eos> Yeah, I'll have Garcia track it.<eos> It'll only work if it's on, though.<eos> It's worth a try.<eos> If the girls had access to a phone and they were okay, they would have called for help by now.
Honestly, bourbon doesn't help much.<eos> It helped you lose an entire day from what I can tell.<eos> Why don't we head upstairs.<eos> Detective.<eos> Look, I understand that you're frustrated, but you're not helping yourself taking it out on him.<eos> I thought this guy was dirty a year ago, and now it's happened again.<eos> There are no bodies, no evidence, no nothing but my gut and 25 years of police work.<eos> Hey, baby girl. Have you found them yet?<eos> I'm about to join the search.<eos> I don't know the location of Katie's cell, which means the battery's dead, but I pulled phone records for both the girls, and holy cannoli, they text more than I do.
Okay.<eos> We have everything we need to move forward -- blueprints, computer modeling.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> All right, now, if we do move forward, I insist we use the right materials.<eos> The I-beams need to be American standard, wide flanges.<eos> Bronze-toned, as well?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Expensive.<eos> We can use H-beams.<eos> No, they don't have the same strength over time.
What?<eos> The Keymaster came through?<eos> Well, he did give me another riddle.<eos> What did he say?<eos> When is a key not a key?<eos> When it's a guide.<eos> A guide?<eos> Ridges on keys are numerically coded by width and height.<eos> Maybe they're coordinates.<eos> The shapes, they look familiar.
No, I remember him well.<eos> Marine uniform, well-spoken, everything all organized in a leather-bound folder.<eos> I liked him immediately, but I couldn't give him a loan.<eos> Why not?<eos> No credit history, and on his salary I had doubts about his ability to pay it back.<eos> You know what he was looking to spend it on?<eos> He said he and his girlfriend were on their own.<eos> He wanted to make sure he could give her a good life.<eos> They were so sweet to each other.<eos> You know how some people just look like they belong together?
I can't.<eos> You won't be alone.<eos> Everyone you blame for your mistakes is waiting for you just on the other side.<eos> - I'm a warrior.<eos> Warrior!<eos> - Prove it.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I can help you.<eos> Biologically speaking, young girls have a blood rite that initiates them into adulthood, whether they are ready for it or not.
Oh, this is not good.<eos> Whoa, don't off yourself yet, general, I need some help.<eos> Why am I suddenly this entire town's personal Dr. Phil?<eos> Look,<eos> Zoe read some belle relationship manifesto and she's burying herself in projects.<eos> All right, she's being way too nice to me, and I tried to talk to her about it this morning, and she just kept quilting.<eos> Ah, yes, I am entirely too familiar with the diary of Lucille lavinius Jeremiah Jones and the particular insanity of those that would ask themselves w.W.L.L.J.J.D.?<eos> I figured, so what do I do?<eos> Well, the way I see it, women are like volcanoes.<eos> They need to have constant mini eruptions to let off some of that pressure, or you're going to get hit with a giant one, like a huge one, like a fricking Pompeii, like your fiancée sleeping with the mayor.
(Chuckles) (Exhales) - Ryan Vogelson.<eos> Pleasure to meet you, sir.<eos> - Hey.<eos> So, Dad who won't let his son say the Pledge of Allegiance, why don't you meet a big ex-marine? Have at him.<eos> I admire that you stand up for your principles.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I do!<eos> I-I fought for America.<eos> And to me, those stars don't just represent 50 states.<eos> They represent different beliefs, and I fought for them all.
Because Ryan left the room.<eos> When are you girls gonna date a go-getter?<eos> I mean, a guy that might actually take care of you?<eos> (Both) Take care of us?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean somebody with ambition.<eos> When I was in high school, I had all sorts of jobs.<eos> I was working all the time-- mowing lawns, raking leaves.<eos> Teenage boys were the illegal aliens of the '70s.<eos> Mike, we didn't raise our girls to believe they need a man to take care of them.
Every time I looked for him today, he was missing.<eos> He dumped all his workload on Kyle.<eos> He's done the impossible.<eos> He's actually made Kyle look like an overachiever.<eos> I bet he isn't as bad as you say he is.<eos> What do you know about picking guys?<eos> Just 'cause you nailed it perfectly 25 years ago.<eos> You know what, honey?<eos> You just have to accept that your daughters are gonna like boys whether you like them or not.<eos> Unless, of course, they join a convent, and then they can be married to Jesus.
I am blood.<eos> And I am not allowed the same access?<eos> What do you want me to say, Ziva?<eos> The guy's Mossad.<eos> I was Mossad.<eos> And now you're the daughter of a dead man.<eos> Why don't you let yourself act like one?<eos> McGee, what do you got?<eos> Still tracking the source of the shooter's payment, but we've got something on the bullets.<eos> Turns out they're Russian.
Why would I want to destroy something so beautiful?<eos> BJ, any mom would be impressed by your life.<eos> Sure, you're mean sometimes, like just rude, and your boyfriend eats chicken while watching you shower, which has really stuck with me.<eos> No napkin required.<eos> He just gets in with me when he's full.<eos> BJ, I feel so strongly about you being honest with your mom, you've left me with no other choice.<eos> Don't you dare.<eos> The glasses are coming off.<eos> Don't.<eos> They're coming off, BJ.
You would see me weighted with unnecessary comforts.<eos> Have I grown that heavy?<eos> These are yours?<eos> I would not be found wanting, if campaign stretches beyond expectation.<eos> You wish to join me, in pursuit of Spartacus?<eos> I wish no such thing.<eos> Yet I will not be removed from your arms for months threatening years.<eos> Publius and I shall travel with you and Tiberius.<eos> You know women are forbidden within encampment.<eos> Yet they are not banned from followers' camp, unless rules have shifted absent knowledge.
And unfortunate events of war trod path of distant memory.<eos> It is heavy burden.<eos> Gaze at war's end.<eos> And weigh bitter cost of it.<eos> You do not believe that we can defeat Crassus?<eos> You are forever conjuring the impossible.<eos> And I would not wager against you in final gambit.<eos> Yet odds are not of a favor.<eos> No.<eos> They are not.
- 21 people are dead.<eos> - Did any of them live here?<eos> No.<eos> In an historic address to a joint session of Congress, the president implored lawmakers to pass the American Jobs Act.<eos> The president used the phrase, "Pass this jobs bill"<eos> 18 times during his address.<eos> Pass this jobs bill and we can put people to work rebuilding America.<eos> Everyone here knows we have badly decaying roads and bridges all over the country.<eos> Our highways are clogged with traffic, our skies are the most congested in the world...<eos> Pass this jobs bill, and companies will get extra tax credits if they hire American veterans.
What are we waiting for, right?<eos> Sure looks dead enough for me.<eos> And you have no real memories of the last 7 years?<eos> I-I've gots of the last sa hazy recollection.<eos> Of being either on a street or...<eos> Or an alley.<eos> The lab work does indicate some drug abuse.<eos> Uh, we were able to locate a marylin cooper.<eos> And, uh, you have two daughters, emma and michaela?<eos> Yes. Yes. Are... are they here?
Another thing I already knew.<eos> Well, I don't know that I can tell you anything you don't already know.<eos> But perhaps you can tell me what your hesitation is.<eos> Speak.<eos> Yes.<eos> Now, I understand you might have some concerns about the financial disclosures leading...<eos> Speak.<eos> No.<eos> I have eight people representing me at eight simultaneous meetings in six time zones right now.<eos> I sit here and answer their questions, provided they come in the form of a single yes or no proposition.
Okay?<eos> Mwah. Yo, I like tea.<eos> Man, there's nothing like a hot cup of tea on a really cold night.<eos> [Chuckles] And we had a lot of cold nights.<eos> - Hell yeah. - Yeah. I never wanna sleep in a semi cab again.<eos> Do you remember that one time...<eos> - yeah, with the sheriff.<eos> - In the woods? Mmhmm. Living on sardines and fritos, agh.<eos> Oh, my God. Oh!<eos> Both: Yeah. Yo, have you guys ever seen fireflies when they all light up at the same time?

Protect your flank at all costs.<eos> Protect your ass is what you mean.<eos> Chris Freed and I go a long way back.<eos> I told him I'd help out any way I can.<eos> He needed a place in town to stay,<eos> I knew these party donors who were away, so I arranged it for him to stay at their house-- the same house Serena Andrews' body was found in.<eos> Okay, why didn't you tell me the truth when you handed me the case?<eos> Because a scandal like this could ruin a good man's life and his chances of being elected.<eos> You didn't think I was gonna find out?<eos> I was hoping to contain your findings as they came in, determine if they were credible.

I don't care as long as you brought those bridal magazines.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> I had a day today that pushed your stupid wedding to the bottom of the list.<eos> - Did you get fired?<eos> - No. I don't think so.<eos> Who can tell at that place?<eos> What happened?<eos> One of the girls asked me to punch out her time card and we got caught.<eos> I told you, those girls aren't your friends.<eos> Yes, they are.
That next time, he won't be so lucky to make it out alive?<eos> How do you know so much?<eos> Because we created him.<eos> The group I represent feels responsible for his condition... the hell he's been through.<eos> And we want to heal him.<eos> Fix the mistakes that we've made.<eos> You do want that, don't you?<eos> To have the man you fell in love with back?<eos> I don't know...<eos> Alex, his mutations... they'll only grow more and more grotesque.
Lance Corporal Gabe Crowe.<eos> 23 years old, transferred to Quantico last August.<eos> Family?<eos> Mother's being notified.<eos> It's a long fall.<eos> Yeah, but I'm not sure that's what killed him.<eos> Take a look here, Jethro.<eos> Trauma to the side of his head, nasal bleeding.<eos> Defensive wounds to the hands and arms, and... these unusual cuts.<eos> They look like stab wounds.
Exactly.<eos> When I re-created the puncture wounds on Crowe's side and legs, I was able to determine the size and the shape of the weapon.<eos> I mean, it's not an exact match, but it's close, Gibbs.<eos> It's-it's really close.<eos> Basically, we're looking for some kind of tool, something jagged.<eos> Ducky said the guy was stitched up?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But not how you'd think.<eos> See how there's no pattern to the suture marks?<eos> They're all... disordered and...
Where were you last night?<eos> I told you, I was on a job.<eos> There was no callout.<eos> I met a mate.<eos> What's your mate's name?<eos> Can't remember.<eos> Sorry?<eos> Danny was killed here.<eos> We also found another set of prints by the sink.<eos> They belong to Mark Latimer.
Is this what you do, El?<eos> Just tell us the truth.<eos> Miller, take his things.<eos> Hiya.<eos> Beth.<eos> We weren't expecting you.<eos> Can I help anyone?<eos> No, we're fine.<eos> Shall I restock the racks, Janet?<eos> They're fine.
So I am hoping that we can tie at least one of them to Silvana's poisoning.<eos> Well, I can tell you this much.<eos> Silvana Cuerto was poisoned with cyanide by way of unprocessed cassava leaves.<eos> So at least our killer is consistent.<eos> Not entirely, because in Silvana's case, he changed the method of delivery.<eos> In addition to the cassava leaves, I found gelatin and plant polysaccharides.<eos> Which is from soluble capsules?<eos> Yes.<eos> So, Silvana ingested pills filled with poison.<eos> Yes, again, but I don't think she knew that they were filled with poison.

I'm not Paul.<eos> I know you're not.<eos> Savi, what are you doing?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Do you have the valet ticket I thought I had it.<eos> - But I can't find it.<eos> - I think it's in the room.<eos> Yo. I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what is happening.<eos> All day I've been obsessing about the flowers.<eos> Who are they from, Dom or Harry?
Wait a second.<eos> Wait a second. Was this last night?<eos> Did you cancel plans with my friend so that you could go have sex with your boss?<eos> - Oh, my God. - [Groans]<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Alex, it wasn't a plan.<eos> I really had to show a house, and then...<eos> What kind of person does that?<eos> [Huffs] Oh. This is the problem with women.<eos> They're too hung up on sex.
I mean, no need.<eos> If you do see him, don't tell him you saw me.<eos> Ruben, mi querido.<eos> You're just in time for dinner.<eos> Mijo, you're too thin.<eos> Are you eating?<eos> Yes, mom, I still eat.<eos> Don't worry, I made your favorite...<eos> - Albondigas y tostones. - Mmm.<eos> And your sisters, they're so excited to see you.

This building is Evil and you are in danger living here.<eos> I think the gray conveys maturity and experience, things that have become rare nowadays.<eos> I think it looks just as good as the other two that you've tried.<eos> Yeah, well, it's my first day, I want to make a good impression.<eos> The candidate for city council, Henry Martin.<eos> Enjoy it, but don't become obssed with it.<eos> Well, you know I'm obsessive, that's why I must have everything perfectly organized.<eos> I will begin to enjoy it when I win the election... and when you find my lucky socks.<eos> Have you seen my blue socks?<eos> They should be perfectly organized in you drawer.
You can only hold my client if you have more questions.<eos> Oh, I have questions.<eos> I have lots of questions.<eos> Bones, what's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'm going into surgery.<eos> Those two things are opposite.<eos> You need evidence to hold Batuhan.<eos> These two things aren't even connected.<eos> Yes, they are.
They're all over the C.C.U.<eos> Next they'll be in the O.R.s, the hallways, the on-call rooms.<eos> We're being spied on, Mer.<eos> Who knows what evil lurks behind that electronic eye?<eos> Morning, Dr. Yang.<eos> Big Brother knows my name.<eos> Big Brother can see your name tag.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> The cameras are not here to spy on you.<eos> They are here to supplement you.
I'm gonna make his little hand flip us off again.<eos> No, it's not just me.<eos> Three mothers are giving the party, and we need all our names in the card--<eos> Gloria Pritchett, Sara Leonard, Dee Cho...<eos> What do you mean that there's no more room?<eos> Dee Cho must go on.<eos> Okay, come on.<eos> That one had to be on purpose.<eos> Okay, we'll be there then.<eos> They won't be ready until one more hour.
No, I don't!<eos> This is my commission!<eos> Ouch.<eos> Why so ornery?<eos> It's not the 7th yet.<eos> Your shoes are red now.<eos> Mommy!<eos> You survived, huh?<eos> Indeed, I did.<eos> How were they?
Couldn't have been better.<eos> We had a wonderful time.<eos> Well, that's good.<eos> 'Cause my sitter's still out of town, so I really hate to ask you this, but is there any way you could take them again tomorrow?<eos> Of course.<eos> I'd be delighted.<eos> You're a lifesaver.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Girls, you wanna spend another day with Ron?<eos> I believe one problem with hiring women is that they're frail and breakable.
- All right.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Let's do it, trash people!<eos> Here you are.<eos> I had to search the directory for quite a while.<eos> I thought your last name was Hanson for some reason.<eos> No, it's Perkins.<eos> Always has been.<eos> You seem more like a Hanson.<eos> Anyway, I have the girls again today, and they're asking to play with you.

Tommy for the dunk!<eos> My screen!<eos> But it was actually a blood-hungry witch who was wearing their mom's face like a mask!<eos> What is wrong with you, woman?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I thought kids liked ghost stories.<eos> Hey, girls!<eos> Did you wanna look through my nurse kit?<eos> - Yeah! - Ooh, check it out, bandages!<eos> We can wrap up the dolls, and pretend they just had surgery.
Previous collar for soliciting.<eos> Sounds like a john.<eos> Likely her last.<eos> Get to Klemmer/Stein, talk to the guy.<eos> You and McKenzie run the interview.<eos> Lieutenant...<eos> I just want progress.<eos> Now move.<eos> Natasha, I mentioned my sister before... so trust me that I know a little about girls like you.<eos> How they get mixed up in things, and how they lie.
The damselfish can be found in all the seven seas.<eos> The average size of damsels is around two inches, but they can reach over 14 inches in length.<eos> Damselfish even cultivate red filamentous algae.<eos> Garibaldi and damselfish are the only fish currently known to engage in farming or cultivating.<eos> That might be why damselfish are very settled and never leave their territory.<eos> Young damselfish are often very colourful.<eos> Brilliantly hued in blues, greens, violets, reds and browns.<eos> But with age, they lose their colourful appearance and all full-grown damselfish look more or less the same.<eos> Sea turtles do not breathe through gills like fish, they need air like humans do.<eos> That's because they are descendants of the land-dwelling turtles that moved into the oceans about 100 million years ago.

They inhabit tropical waters from Florida to South America.<eos> Perhaps the most unique internal feature of the tarpon is the modified swim bladder.<eos> This allows the tarpon to take oxygen directly from the atmosphere and thus increases its tolerance of oxygen-poor waters.<eos> The lion-fish is truly wonderful, and its diverse feathering makes it a coveted addition to show-aquariums.<eos> In fact, the lion-fish originally came from the waters of the Pacific Ocean, between Malaysia and Japan, its habitat being lagoons and outer reefs.<eos> Since the end of the 20th century, the lion-fish has been sighted in the west part of the North Atlantic Ocean, from the coast of Florida up to North Carolina.<eos> Set free by aquarists, the lion-fish now has no natural enemies and breeds too strongly and too fast.<eos> Often, and without meaning to, humans interfere with ecosystems they do not completely understand and misfortunes are bound to occur, and sadly things might never go back to their natural order.<eos> Watching manta rays as they swim is an extraordinary experience.<eos> Often they appear in pods, which is the term for when several fish swim together, and they like to visit cleaning stations.
You saved my life.<eos> Now, let's celebrate you being a hero and me not being dead.<eos> (Cheering)<eos> Yeah...<eos> Hi.<eos> Sorry, he's taken.<eos> ♪ Bought myself a drop-top car today ♪<eos> ♪ I bought myself a drop-top car today... ♪ (Bell rings, door opens)<eos> These braces hurt.<eos> They're too tight.
I've been, uh, thinking, and I feel like I'm ready to, um, to end our relationship, you and I.<eos> Why?<eos> What's happened?<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> I just, I'm ready.<eos> Don't throw away the progress we've made over the years.<eos> I'm not sure you're ready to just stop treatment.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm ready to accept things the way they are.
I might have something back here.<eos> Yeah, that's it right there.<eos> Handwriting's a match.<eos> It's our guy.<eos> Robert McManus has a history of schizophrenia multiple stays at a psych ward, recent episodes were triggered by his son's death.<eos> Hey, where are we on deployment?<eos> Every beat cop in the city has his photo.<eos> S.W.A.T.'s sitting on his place in Jersey, but his neighbors say he hasn't been there in a month.<eos> He disappears for long stretches.<eos> We're scouring through his financials, but they are severely outdated.
It's sad.<eos> I know.<eos> Come here.<eos> We're good.<eos> We're really, really good.<eos> I'll always protect you.<eos> I'm hiring a realtor.<eos> That girl.<eos> I knew her years ago.<eos> Listen, Abs. Sometimes these women, I protect them and they get...
Honey, I wish we'd known.<eos> - Yeah. We got a dinner thing with the Flendersons. - Mm.<eos> Okay, you don't have to stay, and those aren't even real people.<eos> Sorry. I panicked.<eos> I got stuck between the Flemings and the Hendersons.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Are those new boots?<eos> Yes.<eos> I love them.<eos> They're so cute!
- Take the Vicuna Original air date February 4, 2013<eos> Oh, I forgot.<eos> I brought my own bags.<eos> Let's go. ( Groaning )<eos> You've got to be kidding.<eos> Could you guys open up another register?<eos> Come on.<eos> And that's the stage with seating all around.<eos> Oh, and we're going to hang lanterns in all the trees.<eos> They'll be dimmed before the performances.
There's always a chance, right?<eos> Hope is a dangerous thing.<eos> You come in here and you tell me you've come up empty?<eos> No, that's unacceptable.<eos> It's totally unacceptable.<eos> You find it.<eos> Sir, shouldn't this be on Luschek?<eos> It's Luschek's fault it's missing, it's your fault it hasn't been found.<eos> You go easy on these girls and what happens?<eos> They take advantage.
Good.<eos> Only three rejects.<eos> Ugh, this job is disgusting.<eos> She said about my livelihood.<eos> Listen, it's time for dessert.<eos> Can you please circulate the fruit tarts?<eos> Uh, you know what?<eos> I have realized why these women are not responding to me.<eos> It's this apron.<eos> They're seeing me not as one of them.

- Have you found something?<eos> - Women's shoes.<eos> Individual shoes, not pairs, some of them older.<eos> High heels are a far cry from brains.<eos> It's not exactly your killer's usual M.O.<eos> If you recall when all this began, I expressed my doubts that this was the work of someone new to killing.<eos> Albert wouldn't be the first to alter his methods.<eos> Yeah, still, something about it doesn't quite add up.<eos> But, just to be safe, I'm pulling prints off the shoes.<eos> I'll run them through the station's database for missing persons and homicide victims, but they're only partials.
Dexter, what are you doing?<eos> This is something you don't want to get in the middle of.<eos> He said he'd sooner see her in prison than lose her.<eos> If that's what he thinks this is about, she's the one in danger.<eos> I thought you were going to find out if Hannah was a threat to you and Debra, not if Miles was a threat to Hannah.<eos> [Phone vibrates]<eos> Why can't I do both?<eos> Your flowers.<eos> That's the thing about plants.<eos> You don't look after 'em, they die.
No!<eos> No!<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> What are bees doing in here?<eos> Buzzing.<eos> I mean, why aren't they on the roof with the others?
Oh, good...<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm Tina.<eos> I'll be your server today, and hopefully in the future, your good friend.<eos> That's nice.<eos> I'll have a cheeseburger.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Okay, two cheeseburgers...<eos> Claire, did you see Rachel's legs?<eos> They are so hairy.
A hairless sheep!<eos> So you gave in to peer pressure.<eos> It happens to everybody.<eos> I mean, why do you think I wear these shoes?<eos> 'Cause you don't care what you look like?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> 'Cause I...<eos> No.<eos> 'Cause I saw some other chefs wearing them and I thought they were cool.
Duncan.<eos> See, when your brother stumbles, as we all do, it's nice to have someone there who shares the same blood type.<eos> Oh. This is all nonsense.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Don't, don't.<eos> I'm sorry, Brendan, I mean, you do give really good advice about brothers.<eos> Great.<eos> This is great.<eos> Oh, God, I am so sorry about your stones.<eos> Now that they've hit the ground, they're rocks.
What?<eos> What? What?<eos> What?<eos> Dr. Trachtenberg's examined all the patients exposed to the light.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> And they're all getting worse?<eos> - No.<eos> The two patients in this room are both in Stage IV lung cancer.<eos> This is Maggie and this is Lucy.<eos> They're in complete remission.
- No, let me rephrase that.<eos> Why the fuck are we talking about noodles?<eos> I'll tell you why.<eos> Hostage crisis, noodles, same principle.<eos> Both require precision timing, neither should be rushed.<eos> Inaction only becomes untenable when more than 65% of Americans support intervention even with casualties.<eos> So you'd like me to tell the Vice President we do nothing until then?<eos> Waiting is not doing nothing.<eos> I choose to wait for my noodles even though my salivary glands are crying out to me like newly hatched birds.<eos> But they will thank me because I waited until... (BELL DINGS)
It's robust.<eos> Would you like to give me a definition as well?<eos> Well, I'm guessing that you think you have a sense of humor, Mr. Hessler.<eos> Which you are wrong about, as you are about the calendar.<eos> That is my definition of robust.<eos> My speech is a face-melter.<eos> These buzz cuts are gonna flip.<eos> It's not your speech.<eos> My fingerprints are all over that sucker.<eos> They're sticky and they're on the back, Mike.
Hey. I don't want you working today.<eos> Mm. Come here.<eos> I got like 60 bucks saved.<eos> Maybe, if you want, we could go see a movie later, get Chinese.<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> But only if we see something scary, 'cause you a little scaredy-cat.<eos> Well, you should have just given Jablonski the file, like we talked about.<eos> This one's on me.<eos> It's not like we had nothing to go on.<eos> I mean, th-these girls, they got regular Johns, pimps.
Stay away from us.<eos> I've forgiven him, but I don't ever want to see you again.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I mean, I thought we had a good thing, Sarah.<eos> Last night, and then some guy shows up,<eos> - and you--<eos> - You don't know me.<eos> What?<eos> I break things.<eos> I do- - I break them, and they don't ever get fixed.
Jenny again?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Her temperature spiked this morning, and suddenly it's showtime.<eos> She's got this baby making down to a science.<eos> Sounds romantic.<eos> I feel like a rooster in a henhouse.<eos> Except for, there's only one hen-- a very bossy hen.<eos> Okay, Espo, you and the rooster start a canvass, and Castle and I will talk to the producer, see if he can give us any background on Hannah's life.<eos> Look, I am not this person.<eos> Things just happen, and they... They end up defining you, but it's... It's not always fair.
I'll tell you where she was--<eos> Madagascar.<eos> As in the country off the southeastern coast of Africa, made famous by the adorable animated film?<eos> The material I found underneath her fingernails-- not skin from an attacker.<eos> It's alluaudia.<eos> And what is alluaudia?<eos> A rare spiny plant cultivated primarily in Madagascar.<eos> So how did it get under her fingernails?<eos> Beats me.<eos> As for her defensive wounds, they were not sustained at the time of murder.

I-I will.<eos> I can. I will.<eos> And now I will go home to my husband, because... I'm his Valentine.<eos> But she already hated you, Castle.<eos> So it doesn't sound like you're any worse off.<eos> I do respect the way she handled it, though-- strong, decisive.<eos> I feel like somehow, it brought us closer.<eos> I am sorry about the earrings, though.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> They were... stunning.
It's the world's biggest provider of mercenaries.<eos> Not only do they supply the arms, but... they supply the men who use them.<eos> So Pelant killed a highly-trained professional soldier.<eos> A target like that is a huge risk, even for him.<eos> He's escalating.<eos> Yeah, but the question is why.<eos> I ran a tox screen-- no poisons, but I found highly elevated levels of adrenocorticosteroids.<eos> Have you found any signs of... torture?<eos> Look at these antemortem striations on the fourth and fifth cervical vertebrae.<eos> - They were made by needles.
Hey, Bobby, you know how I told you no to feed the seagulls out back?<eos> That's why.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Yeah, the seagull population in this town has exploded.<eos> They're everywhere.
Don't be shy.<eos> That is hilarious!<eos> That's like putting sunglasses on a dog!<eos> I know, right? !<eos> - I'll see you, guys.<eos> - Bye.<eos> It always works in movies.<eos> There is no way that you could look out at all of this beauty and not believe in some kind of higher power.<eos> Yeah, but, um, what's up with all the seagulls?<eos> They seem really focused on us.
They used to?<eos> - It's not possible any more.<eos> On the way to the slaughterhouse, that's when they get some fresh air.<eos> Why are they tied down?<eos> If the sow isn't tied down, you can't catch the piglets.<eos> Can I stroke them while they're drinking?<eos> Is he frightened?<eos> - No, it's fine.<eos> We tie pregnant sows down to save space.<eos> How long are they tied down for?
I know, no business stuff, but I just got a text about a big order.<eos> That's fine, just remember this weekend--<eos> Oh, I know, me and you.<eos> Me and you, me and you--<eos> Max! Max.<eos> Turns out the B.S. Bride isn't B.S.<eos> She wants pricing on a wedding cupcake cake, and a groom's cupcake cake, for 300 guests.<eos> Great!<eos> Almost as great as these little fuzzy shoes!<eos> They were in a sealed plastic package.
This is weird.<eos> I'm collecting a sample of the virus to create a vaccine.<eos> Now we wait for it to congeal.<eos> Who's the girl?<eos> Amber Weaver.<eos> She's sick, too.<eos> After we make sure this works, I'm going to cure her cold.<eos> I knew she was getting sick this morning.<eos> Her cheeks were getting flushed.<eos> They're usually pale, but not a bad pale.
Are you currently seeing Ezra Fitz?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> This might be bigger than Mona, okay?<eos> She could be working for someone.<eos> Why didn't you tell me this?<eos> 'Cause I was being protective.<eos> Are you immediate family?<eos> Umm, no.<eos> Then you need to wait outside.<eos> Those bitches are finally going to get what they deserve.
What's wrong?<eos> - Are you OK?<eos> - Yes. It'll pass.<eos> - You're sure?<eos> - No.<eos> It's...<eos> It's nothing.<eos> An anxiety attack.<eos> I'm angry, too.<eos> For these women could be free, but aren't, when they have all the means to be.
Listen.<eos> Shorty, right?<eos> Tracks off a yet-to-be-released album.<eos> Damn.<eos> My mind is gone.<eos> Just gone.<eos> Looks like there is no footage from Washington and Carondelet.<eos> That camera's been inoperable for some time.<eos> So it's there for what reason?<eos> Cameras do serve as a deterrent, whether they work or not.
Like Natalie's spirit-crushing barnyard puzzle. - Oh.<eos> Have you seen it?<eos> - The horses are brown.<eos> The dog is brown.<eos> Farmer brown is brown.<eos> I mean, what sadist designed that puzzle, you know?<eos> And I can't make heads or tails out of the universal remote.<eos> No.<eos> It just doesn't work, and nowadays, the TVs...<eos> They don't have a physical "on" button, so it's neither universal nor remote.
He must have heard that Tamaulipas has been under siege by the cartels for several years now.<eos> As the cartels have grown more sophisticated, we have seen them reach out to successful businessmen across the border for advice.<eos> If you're suggesting my brother came down here to do business with the cartel, you're out of your mind.<eos> Then he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.<eos> Someone must have spotted a rich tourist, followed him here, robbed him, and killed him.<eos> Sad to say, it happens too often in Nuevo Laredo.<eos> The culprit is hardly ever found.<eos> No.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> Things with J.R. were almost never as they appeared to be.
I'm going to keep working on Gary to get that oil turned back on.<eos> I don't see why I should stop doing business just because J.R.'s gone.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> My father's barely cold, and you're talking about already going to seduce his brother?<eos> Could you at least pretend to mourn him for five minutes?<eos> For my sake?<eos> !<eos> And we'll set up a meeting after that.<eos> Thomas, tell your mother we got the flowers.<eos> They're just lovely.
And if you open up that door, you'll see why I was driving so slow.<eos> Oh, no, please don't write me a ticket.<eos> Look, I have a van, my fiancée has a moped.<eos> And when I spend the night at my fiancée's house, I can't borrow my mom's car, and...<eos> Look, I swear it's safe.<eos> I get in accidents all the time.<eos> Don't worry. I figured out a way to drive Hope that's even safer.<eos> Does this involve the text message you sent asking me to fill a shopping cart with marshmallows?<eos> These vintage cash registers are going to be a treat for the customers, but a terrible burden for all of you.<eos> They only go up to nine dollars and 99 cents, and they may be plated in lead, so whatever you do, don't lick your fingers after using them.
You're done?<eos> Far as I know.<eos> Okay.<eos> The thing is, I think that a few basic changes could drastically improve the quality of life.<eos> Like clinic hours every week for preventative health care.<eos> And re-opening the track.<eos> And maybe legal counseling.<eos> And the GED program.<eos> Now, I understand that there's a mold situation in the classroom, but this needs to be addressed.<eos> The inmates down the hill, they get classes, and they are not getting out any time soon.
You know what, sit your ass down.<eos> It's time to get serious.<eos> What you gonna do about hair?<eos> But if you get some puta pregnant...<eos> Gonna go and bounce on daddy's lap?<eos> What did I do now?<eos> Don't be all cute, college.<eos> Have you seen my teeth?<eos> Like, really?<eos> They're...
See, if I made a joke like that to Shoshanna, she would just stare at me.<eos> - ( dog barks )<eos> - Give me the old slow blink.<eos> Control your animal!<eos> - ( dog barks ) - Jesus.<eos> How's that going with you and Shoshanna?<eos> Good.<eos> Really good.<eos> Really good.<eos> I mean, I know she thinks I haven't done enough with my life considering, you know, my age, but it's hard to tell someone so young that things don't always end up the way you thought they'd be.
Let's do it.<eos> (Man) Timber!<eos> (Clank) Ha ha ha.<eos> Whoo!<eos> Seniors rule!<eos> (Laughs) Ahh.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - Whoa.<eos> Letters are huge.<eos> Hells, yeah, they are.
Can we just take a second to marvel in the fact that Bay was actually arguing for school?<eos> My hearing daughter at a deaf school?<eos> You dared me to dream big.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> And I never thought I was interested in swimming pools, but then I found these.<eos> It's a new kind of ecological pool where you have all these native plants that filter the water.<eos> There are zero chemicals.<eos> The plants do all the work, just like a real pond.<eos> Only, you know, not disgusting.<eos> They're beautiful.
Well, he was getting old and easily manipulated.<eos> We're his family.<eos> We were just looking out for him.<eos> I tried to warn him, but he just thought I was after his inheritance, that I was afraid that he was going to leave the plantation to Kim.<eos> Of course, you didn't care about the money!<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> I don't!<eos> I just wanted him and Aunt Nicole to get back together.<eos> I just wanted...<eos> I just wanted things to go back to how they were.
Thomas Leonard.<eos> I've been retained by your sisters to represent you.<eos> Take 'em off.<eos> I'm sure you don't wanna be accused of obstructing attorney-client privileges.<eos> Anytime now would suffice.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Quite the bind you're in.<eos> Glad you noticed.<eos> From your sisters.<eos> They specifically asked that I have first word with you before reading it.

And then the road disappeared altogether.<eos> Oh, Lord.<eos> Which wasn't ideal in cars like these.<eos> James, we're the idiots, we listened to him with a suggestion for a route.<eos> Relax, we're nearly there now.<eos> Ow. Oh! Bad noises!<eos> I don't know what's best - keep going on Clarkson's stupid route, turn round and go back and find another one.<eos> How can you not like this road?<eos> Go away.<eos> It's brilliant.
Coffee good?<eos> Yeah, it was lovely.<eos> It was delicious.<eos> Good!<eos> Jeremy Clarkson, James May.<eos> Yes, what's wrong?<eos> Uh, I was just thinking of remortgaging my house and wondering if I should go for a fixed rate or a flexible policy, what do you think?<eos> As you well know, businessmen do not drive cars of this nature, how was the turnip harvest last year?<eos> It's all very well being rude about the people of Norfolk, but so far they seem to have built the best car.<eos> It hasn't gone wrong, it goes off road and it saved me when I made a cock-up.
Petrified forests, mysterious lakes.<eos> This is all very odd.<eos> Not looking, not looking, not looking, not looking.<eos> Ow!<eos> Oh.<eos> I think Hammond really loves that Mustang.<eos> Ow!<eos> I've lost another gear.<eos> It's your route, it's your route.<eos> This road, it's killing the car!
Not looking, not looking, not looking, not looking.<eos> Ow!<eos> Oh.<eos> I think Hammond really loves that Mustang.<eos> Ow!<eos> I've lost another gear.<eos> It's your route, it's your route.<eos> This road, it's killing the car!<eos> The dashboard is a Christmas tree and the car has stopped.<eos> It's dead.
Oh, and I thought we were gonna be friends.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm headed to the ball pit.<eos> Same thing he said as he dove under the covers last night.<eos> ♪ Men. ♪<eos> Thanks for having us.<eos> I got to say, this is a great spot for a playdate.<eos> This view is amazing.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, it is.
Okay, fellas, dinner's at 6:00.<eos> Don't be late.<eos> Ham waits for no one.<eos> You got it, my dear.<eos> All right, let's hit it.<eos> You look a little skinny from behind there.<eos> You lost some weight?<eos> Eh, I'm trying.<eos> What is it with this song?<eos> Feels like it's on a constant loop.
What is it?<eos> Hey, you really threw away my hair pin?<eos> -What?<eos> - Do you throw it away?<eos> That cheap hair pin?<eos> Yes, it's annoying so I threw it away.<eos> Why do you throw away without asking?<eos> Do you know what kind of hair pin is that?<eos> What kind of hair pin is that?<eos> Is it precious because the president gave it to you?
Excuse me! Excuse me!<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no!<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Thought you might want that back.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - I think it's broken.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> Due to Port Authority Security regulations, the station is now closing.<eos> It will reopen at 5:30 a.m.
I did.<eos> You haven't seen the letter.<eos> There's no coming back from it.<eos> I could've talked to him or forgiven him or worked it out.<eos> But I can't come back from that venom and that hatred and that ugliness.<eos> And so... I knew I had to get back home, so I could destroy the evidence.<eos> And I jump up... to grab my bag, and I turn around...<eos> Only it wasn't there.<eos> Sometimes I think about her skin.<eos> I think about if it's softer than mine.
I'll lodge a complaint against the parents.<eos> Tell us who did this, Nicolas.<eos> If I were you, I'd forget the whole thing.<eos> What proof do we have he's telling the truth?<eos> Maybe he gets beaten at home.<eos> I could inform social services.<eos> Your hard drive must be running backwards!<eos> You really think I beat this child up?<eos> My students are incapable of such violence.<eos> It comes from somewhere else, and I don't want trouble.
Can we talk?<eos> It is an of fence to occupy a building which has been declared unsafe to live in.<eos> Do you realise what you're giving support to?<eos> What if it was your own grandfather?<eos> I won't move from here.<eos> Are you going to wall in a municipal councillor?<eos> We'll come back, Mr Mignard.<eos> There will be other injunctions.<eos> This farm has been standing for four centuries.<eos> Why would it suddenly collapse?
Move, move. Empty the register.<eos> Now.<eos> Go ahead, open this thing up.<eos> Tell this bitch to fucking move it.<eos> Open the register up right now.<eos> Move.<eos> All of it. Give me all of it.<eos> - That ring too. Give me that ring.<eos> - Give me that fucking ring, I said.<eos> It was my mother's.
Doesn't care where I go, what I do.<eos> He knows Manute will always find me.<eos> Isn't that right, Manute?<eos> Madam,<eos> Mr. Lord will require that you be disciplined.<eos> No, Dwight! Don't fight him!<eos> He'll kill you!<eos> He's not human.<eos> I punch a vault door,<eos> It doesn't fall down. So I punch it again.
I give them what they want.<eos> Then I get the hell out of there.<eos> Are you still there, Sam?<eos> He shot me in the gut.<eos> It wasn't me, Sam.<eos> It was the babe.<eos> Rotten town.<eos> It soils everybody it touches.<eos> This rotten town.<eos> Those it can't corrupt, it soils.
Nobody programmed me to be straight.<eos> You decided to be straight?<eos> Please. Of course you were programmed.<eos> By nature or nurture, or both.<eos> And to be honest, Caleb, you're starting to annoy me now, because this is your insecurity talking. This is not your intellect.<eos> Come with me.<eos> You know this guy, right?<eos> Jackson Pollock. Jackson Pollock.<eos> That's right. The drip painter.<eos> Okay. He let his mind go blank, and his hand go where it wanted.
It's not like me.<eos> I'm not surprised nothing more saucy happened.<eos> Judging by how you wiggle on the pool deck.<eos> I wonder if you'll take the plunge.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You're scared of jumping in.<eos> It's complicated.<eos> Why?<eos> He flirts with you, he's cute.<eos> You've tried the water and it's perfect.
He won't let me, that pompous Portley-Rind and his gaggle of giggling sycophants.<eos> Now, now, boss, you be careful up there.<eos> Father always said, if you worked hard, you get a white hat.<eos> Fish!<eos> And what did he ever get?<eos> Nothing!<eos> Hurry, Mr. Gristle!<eos> We're losing him.<eos> I've worked my hump off for this town!<eos> And it's growing back.
- You think that's great?<eos> - You hate farming, Dad.<eos> Grandpa said.<eos> Grandpa said?<eos> Listen, all that matters is how you feel about it.<eos> I like what you do.<eos> I like our farm.<eos> You're gonna be great at it.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> All right, it's a doozy.
We sort of stumbled upon it. We were on a salvage run...<eos> You're sitting in the best-kept secret in the world.<eos> Nobody stumbles in here. Nobody stumbles out.<eos> Cooper, please.<eos> Cooperate with these people.<eos> Look.<eos> It's kind of hard to explain.<eos> We learned these coordinates from an anomaly.<eos> What sort of anomaly?<eos> I hesitate to term it supernatural, but it definitely wasn't scientific.
An incredible sacrifice is being made by the people on Earth who are gonna die!<eos> Because in his fucking arrogance... he declared their case hopeless.<eos> I'm sorry, Cooper...<eos> their case is hopeless.<eos> We are the future.<eos> Cooper, what can I do?<eos> Let me go home.<eos> You're absolutely positive?<eos> His solution was correct. He'd had it for years.<eos> - It's worthless?
- Without seeing...<eos> - the analog mod, I couldn't even guess.<eos> - Sixty seconds... if I can access it.<eos> I retrofitted that device myself.<eos> Lieutenant Brody is our only... EOD Tech to survive the train attack.<eos> Well, it sounds like we could use you.<eos> With all due respect...<eos> - if that doesn't work, then what's Plan B?<eos> - The waterfront... is located one klick downhill.<eos> Get the bomb to the pier, onto a boat... and as far away from the city as possible before it detonates.
It's about Bonnet staying with us at the Chateau.<eos> He comes from a very good family.<eos> I put great emphasis on placing like with like. Of course.<eos> And all the people of Bussy have to be subjected to the law like everyone else. Even if you're the mayor and viscount. I'm sure you appreciate that.<eos> It's about my wife.<eos> She feels uncomfortable with the thought of anyone living with us.<eos> Maybe we could offer something other than our living quarters.<eos> What about my first lieutenant?<eos> I'm sure we can find him somewhere else.<eos> He can stay at the Labarie farm, it's on our estate.
Always the same unfamiliar music.<eos> I was meant to resent him, yet there was relief in his presence after months of silence.<eos> Bubi.<eos> Sorry to disturb you.<eos> The dog isn't mine.<eos> We found him in an abandoned village.<eos> At least he's a Frenchman.<eos> May I'_<eos> Your house is beautiful, Madame.<eos> It isn't mine. It's my mother-in-law's.
A gift from my wife.<eos> I'll instruct my orderly to issue the pass.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We will see each other again.<eos> Not as a soldier.<eos> You won't even recognise me.<eos> Be careful... with your life.<eos> Is it precious to you?<eos> Yes.<eos> It is precious to me.
It is memory precious and pure.<eos> Like your promise.<eos> I have walked there sometimes.<eos> Beyond the forest and up into the night.<eos> I have seen the world fall away and the white light of forever fill the air.<eos> I saw a fire moon once.<eos> It rose over the pass near Dunland.<eos> Huge.<eos> Red and gold, it was.<eos> It filled the sky.

He sent you in here for the Arkenstone, didn't he?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Don't bother denying it.<eos> I guessed his foul purpose some time ago.<eos> But it matters not.<eos> Oakenshield's quest will fail.<eos> The darkness is coming.<eos> It will spread to every corner of the land.<eos> You are being used, Thief in the Shadows.<eos> The coward Oakenshield has weighed the value of your life and found it worth nothing.

What's wrong?<eos> I came in my pants.<eos> All right!<eos> Hi, I'm Darko.<eos> Darko?<eos> Really?<eos> Really.<eos> There's a problem?<eos> We have this bill here.<eos> It seems pretty extravagant.
Hey, Dad.<eos> Hey, how you doing?<eos> - OK.<eos> - I'm here.<eos> That's why I'm OK.<eos> You're hot. Your hand's so cold.<eos> - That feel good?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> His fever?<eos> Yeah, it's Still high.
Who are you?<eos> Danny, this is your Uncle John.<eos> Why, you look just like your dad did when he was your age.<eos> They're going out again.<eos> He deserves a trial, Dan.<eos> Two Rangers are dead.<eos> Didn't get no trial.<eos> Well, I'm coming with you.<eos> The law looks a lot different on the ground, little brother.<eos> Well, it doesn't include vengeance, no matter where you're standing.
Or did you always want to be this?<eos> Two...<eos> One...<eos> Done.<eos> Look.<eos> There.<eos> I told you.<eos> No talent.<eos> The records indicate that you are a highly intelligent man.<eos> As such, I would have expected you to see the situation and understand it for what it is.
Good thing, I bumped into his sister in the next pub, we went into the disableds and I bumped into her again.<eos> Sam tagged along for a while, but then I had to let her go.<eos> I had another date that night and her name was Amber.<eos> Nine pints in and it was us against the world.<eos> Things got mental in The Beehive, so we repaired to the bowls club or as we liked to call it, The Smokehouse, which is when it all went fuck up.<eos> Everyone got para and Pete chucked a whitey, so we had to bench him.<eos> In the end, we blew off the last three pubs and headed for the hills.<eos> I remember sitting up there, blood on my knuckles, beer down my shirt, sick on my shoes, seeing the orange glow of a new dawn break and knowing in my heart, life would never feel this good again.<eos> And you know what?<eos> It never did.
What is bike slang for?<eos> Bicycle.<eos> I'm lost. Don't be.<eos> Okay.<eos> Listen.<eos> This is our chance to finally finish what we started.<eos> Come on, man, it'll be fucking mental!<eos> I think we're all done. So...<eos> How do you like the property?<eos> Yeah. It's amazing.
Come on, man, it'll be fucking mental!<eos> I think we're all done. So...<eos> How do you like the property?<eos> Yeah. It's amazing.<eos> Amazing location.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Fantastic aspects. It's just...<eos> It's just a little bit out of our price range.<eos> He'll knock some off for you.<eos> What's it down for?
- Bill!<eos> Journalists back in 1980 thought that a car chase wasn't news.<eos> But Ron Burgundy wasn't a journalist, he was an anchorman.<eos> Good evening.<eos> I'm Ron Burgundy, reporting live from New York.<eos> We have breaking news developing in our nation's heartland.<eos> A high-speed car chase is in progress...<eos> Keep the "Breaking News" logo up. Keep up the graphic.<eos> ...reaching speeds of up to 100 mph.<eos> And for the first time in news history, we will stay with it live until it resolves in either a huge accident or a massive shootout.
- Maybe he doesn't exist.<eos> - I still want the pictures.<eos> I wanna know who he is, I wanna know where he's from, I wanna know how big his dick is, how long he lasts.<eos> Where do they fuck, in hotels or at his place?<eos> I wanna know if he makes her come, or if she fakes it with him, too.<eos> And I wanna know everything by election day.<eos> - Why?<eos> What's it got to do with the election?<eos> - New Yorkers, they've elected drunks, crooks, Italians, homos, Jews and blacks to that seat, but they will not elect is some guy whose wife is fucking some other guy behind his back.<eos> Now this... pussy, this Jack Valliant, he may be too much of a lightweight to use this story if it comes across his desk.
Until some goons blind-sided me.<eos> - Yeah, we ID'ed him from his license plate.<eos> - Who is he?<eos> - Ex-homicide cop.<eos> Dick Murdock.<eos> You know him?<eos> - Yeah, he works for Sam Lancaster.<eos> - He might work for Sam Lancaster, but he's on Hostetler's payroll.<eos> - Say again?<eos> - All that paperwork you got in your trunk, not to diminish your new beauty mark, but it's fucking worthless.
It's faulty, but you found a buyer, didn't you?<eos> Sold it to the Mandarin.<eos> Got you, pal.<eos> What happened?<eos> Fun fact.<eos> Before he built rockets for the Nazis, the idealistic Wernher von Braun dreamed of space travel.<eos> He stargazed.<eos> Do you know what he said when the first V-2 hit London?<eos> "The rocket performed perfectly."<eos> "It just landed on the wrong planet."
Far East, Europe, North Africa...<eos> Iran, Pakistan, Syria? Where is it?<eos> Actually, sir, it's in Miami.<eos> Okay, kid, I'm gonna have to walk you through rebooting Jarvis's speech drive, but not right now.<eos> Harley, where is he really?<eos> Just look on the screen and tell me where it is.<eos> It does say Miami, Florida.<eos> Okay, first things first, I need the armour.<eos> Where are we at with it?<eos> It's not charging.

Carter, listen to me.<eos> When you were a little boy, your parents turned to you for emotional support. They thrust you into the center of their divorce.<eos> In my book, I called it "parentification."<eos> But look at you now, as an adult.<eos> You're well-adjusted, you're successful, you're responsible.<eos> Look, you're the owner of the Wheatgrass.<eos> Whitegrass.<eos> You're dressing sharp, you have a great haircut.<eos> I want to tell that story, Carter.<eos> - It is a better story.
Hey.<eos> What's this?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Why are you reading it?<eos> I wasn't.<eos> It's probably Trey's.<eos> He's always leaving his crap around.<eos> These poor kids.<eos> One of them, he had this awesome drum set, but his mom wouldn't let him play it, because it was a gift from his dad.<eos> So it just sat in the garage unused, like it was taunting him or something.
What the..? Cool.<eos> Be cool.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> Kill me now and die seconds later never knowing why.<eos> Stop it!<eos> I have your daughter.<eos> If you'd like to see her alive again, I hope we can continue without the violence.<eos> May I see your list?<eos> No.<eos> It's of no use to you, trust me.
- Have fun!<eos> Bye!<eos> - I mean, you gotta be kidding.<eos> - Several of them.<eos> I'm telling you, don't knock shopping on TV until you've tried it.<eos> Beth, I think-I think you're the first person I've ever met... who actually buys stuff off television.<eos> - No! Come on!<eos> - No, it's true.<eos> Oh, well where do you think I got this scarf?<eos> And you know what? I bet it's softer than yours.
You take it back! Take that back!<eos> I want to taste you. I want to lick you till you weep.<eos> - How's your acid reflux?<eos> - How's your HPV?<eos> It's your HPV, Veronica. I'm just carrying it.<eos> Let's not have another "chicken or the egg" debate, Neil. No.<eos> Let's.<eos> - Chicken.<eos> - Egg.<eos> Your flesh... slick with cocoa butter... It haunts me.
It took this path.<eos> You keep it, Kai.<eos> The samurai believed his presence would bring misfortune to their land.<eos> Mika only saw a gentle boy.<eos> Although he lived as an outcast,<eos> Kai was determined to repay the love he received from Mika and her father, whatever the cost.<eos> Kai.<eos> Well?<eos> There is something wrong with the creature.<eos> It's up there on the rise, but it will come down again to hunt.

So sayeth the king.<eos> Isabelle!<eos> Well? Did you get anything...<eos> -...out of him? - No.<eos> He wouldn't spill the beans.<eos> I'm going to ask you just once:<eos> Where are they?<eos> You should have left them where they were buried.<eos> They are born of dark magic.<eos> And once darkness gets a taste for light it will not stop until it has swallowed the sun.
Fabiola, nice to meet you.<eos> So, look, I have suggested to be on this side because this big wheel is quite spectacular.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> More than ever, this will require the collaboration between the theory and experimentalists, so it would be a very nice period where we work together and, uh...<eos> Well, it's fun to finally interact with experimentalists.<eos> I mean, I used to be just in my office, coming up with, you know, crazy ideas.<eos> It's a big thing.<eos> There is a general sense waiting for this machine to start, this massive machine that has taken so many years to build.<eos> We are all in great anticipation of what it might find.<eos> And every time there's even a rumor that a new particle is discovered... even before it turns on... the entire field goes into a fever pitch.
I mean, we know that anybody who's even updating a number somewhere might stop our system for more than an hour quite easily.<eos> So please be absolutely sure that you yourself and everybody in your system is not touching the system, unless it's been agreed by the shift leader, yeah?<eos> Nothing should be touched, yeah?<eos> And that includes all things that you're absolutely dead certain they will not do anything wrong.<eos> Especially those things.<eos> It's being called the largest scientific experiment in history, and some say one that could cause Armageddon.<eos> It's the strangest experiment ever:<eos> mankind's most ambitious attempt to understand how we all got here.<eos> Thousands of scientists from around the world spent 20 years designing an extraordinary machine.<eos> It cost £5 billion and will switching on very soon.
I've got 25.2 miles to go."<eos> And if you're thinking that at the start, then you're done.<eos> Mentally, you are done.<eos> This is what doing discovery physics means.<eos> This is what doing discovery means.<eos> Why do people have curiosity?<eos> Why do we care about how distant parts of the universe, things that happened billion years ago, like the big bang, why do we find them that interesting?<eos> It doesn't affect what we do day-to-day.<eos> But nevertheless, once you have curiosity, you can't control it.<eos> It'll ask questions about the universe.

It's certainly a different experience of it.<eos> I agree.<eos> See, I thought that that belonged here.<eos> It's just... it's the perfect spot.<eos> It certainly changes everything. - It does.<eos> - Slate and granite.<eos> I guess that's the granite, and that's the slate.<eos> It's interesting.<eos> There's something philosophically about this piece of art that bothers me.<eos> It's taking a lot of sort of random things and making some order out of it. Yes.
It's taking a lot of sort of random things and making some order out of it. Yes.<eos> It's trying to make order out of something where there isn't any, instead of taking things that don't seem ordered and figuring out that there is order.<eos> The way we try to reduce the complexity of the world is by looking for patterns, what we call symmetries.<eos> We take all the particles we know today, and we attempt to fit them into some kind of underlying structure.<eos> Are they the remnants of some more beautiful and complete picture of the laws of nature?<eos> It's like, you go to Egypt, and you see ruins.<eos> If you look at it the right way, I could draw a pyramid and see that these chunks of stone are actually the remains of something very clean and very symmetric, very beautiful.<eos> We know that the Standard Model is incomplete.<eos> We know that there's other stuff out there, that there are other particles that we haven't seen yet.<eos> Dark matter is a speculated particle which we think actually dominates the universe, and yet we've never seen it directly, and it's not part of the Standard Model.

Congratulations.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I did feel a sense of pride when the Higgs was announced, but I felt a sense of pride for humanity, that, you know, we little people on a little planet with tiny brains can go so deep and understand what happens.<eos> Now we're talking about subnuclear distances a thousand times smaller than an atomic nucleus.<eos> Nevertheless, we can get things right, and just the power of the human mind.<eos> It's astonishing that there are any laws of nature at all, that they're describable by mathematics, that mathematics is a tool that humans can understand, that the laws of nature can be written on a page.<eos> It's the greatest of all mysteries.<eos> There is a strong sense that we are hearing nature talk to us.<eos> Turns out, the Higgs mass is about as interesting as it could be.<eos> It's sort of in no man's land.

Mom?<eos> - Mom? What are you doing?<eos> - Anna was here.<eos> It's freezing in here.<eos> Mom. Hey, Morn! Sit down.<eos> I'm gonna close the window.<eos> And she wasn't here.<eos> And then I heard a sound from my room, and I--<eos> I came in and the window was open. And....<eos> And it wasn't open before.
Yes, sir.<eos> Did he ever tell you who talked him into joining?<eos> His death is on me.<eos> And yours can't be.<eos> Sir, please.<eos> All I...<eos> Mr. Spock, you said the province where Harrison is hiding is uninhabited?<eos> Affirmative, sir.<eos> As part of our defensive strategy, 31 developed a new photon torpedo.<eos> Long-range and untraceable, it would be invisible to Klingon sensors.
- "'Oh, my God, ' I said."<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - Sounds good.<eos> - But you got a problem with it.<eos> It's just that your rock-like muscle seems to play an inordinately large role - in Linda's autobiography.<eos> - "Inordinately."<eos> - How'd you get here? - Mr. Hefner sent me.<eos> And how about the next time I want your opinion, I'll ask you what my cock tastes like.<eos> "Yes, sir, boss.<eos> Reckon it tastes like a piña colada."
Please, stop.<eos> Please.<eos> Yeah, nice try.<eos> I fucking hate you.<eos> You know, you look like shit.<eos> You know that?<eos> So do you.<eos> Finish her already.<eos> Revenge doesn't change the past.<eos> It won't bring our parents back.
Don't blow this for me.<eos> Do the thing.<eos> Where did he go?<eos> Please, anybody.<eos> I need one more monster. Just one more!<eos> Yeah, sorry.<eos> Doesn't look good.<eos> We have to move on.<eos> Your team doesn't qualify.<eos> Yes, it does!
Come on, I would love to have this.<eos> Want to hear something pathetic?<eos> This was all here when I bought this place.<eos> You're joking.<eos> No.<eos> Furnished with rustic interior design elements. Oh, my God.<eos> That's what the listing said.<eos> That's it. It's all bullshit.<eos> That is not the man you are.<eos> I mean I grew up in a place like this, but not as big and actually not as fancy, but it was, you know, it was the real deal, mountains, trees, hung out with my dad.
That's the sound of me unzipping my very, very fancy dress<eos> - Well, that's good news.<eos> - that I happen to be wearing really cute panties under. - And also, like, a bra that totally, totally matches.<eos> - Chantry...<eos> - Can you picture me in them?<eos> Hey, can you picture me out of them?<eos> L- - I- - I definitely can.<eos> The thing is, I'm just in the middle of the Brazilian presentation now.<eos> That's not to say I don't fully support the concept.<eos> It sounds very interesting.
- Yes.<eos> I mean, I think it might count as lying if you lie to yourself.<eos> No.<eos> Everything might have turned out for the best. I'm...<eos> I'm going back to med school.<eos> - I sent in my application today.<eos> - So you just gave up?<eos> I'm not giving up. I'm going-- I'm getting back to the life I was supposed to have by now.<eos> When you're old and wrinkled and your penis doesn't work anymore--<eos> Not that it's in great shape now. --But in that old, wrinkled, dickless future, will this seem like the right call?
Dad, look.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Oh, I think that's my cue.<eos> No, Khumba!<eos> It's too late.<eos> Look, look!<eos> It's the water!<eos> What is that?<eos> Look at all that water!<eos> Where is it all coming from?
Don't answer that.<eos> Listen to me, mate, just tell me where the Mortal Cup is. And then Jocie will be fine. Lukey, tell me.<eos> Tell me the truth.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - You don't want to make me angry!<eos> I'm going to ask you again, mate.<eos> - Where's the Cup?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> We all want the same thing, Lukey Boy, don't we?<eos> Difference is, I think you know where it is.
Hey, dude, where's my plus-3 mace?<eos> Am I thy weapon's keeper?<eos> Hey, man.<eos> Found it!<eos> Oh, hey, dude.<eos> You bent my mace.<eos> That's not cool.<eos> Sorry, man.<eos> My mom made me this mace.<eos> It's still fierce.
Don't you... No, no, no!<eos> And could I get some Visine please?<eos> Great.<eos> I mean, would you like your kitty cat to be used as bait?<eos> You have three-and-a-half pounds of crayfish. I need three-and-a-half pounds of crayfish.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> I was telling him they're too little to eat, and we have a strict no return policy.<eos> What difference does it make what I want them for?<eos> These are the babies of a species.<eos> We judge a culture on how it treats its children, right?
Why don't they get us tubes, like astronauts? I don't know.<eos> The sandwiches are pretty good.<eos> Chicken baloney?<eos> Do you have any idea where that even comes from?<eos> Yeah, a chicken.<eos> It's a lot harder than that.<eos> I didn't know you painted.<eos> I don't really.<eos> But somehow, tracing these lines is really going to help me remember this place.<eos> 'Cause let's face it, the next time I come back it probably won't be here.
Cortez has been racing cars, since he was a teenager.<eos> His father build him his own track in Sinaloa.<eos> He's been racing on the pro circuit in South America... under a pseudonym.<eos> I saw him drive.<eos> He's good.<eos> Quiet!<eos> Quiet!<eos> Bannister.<eos> Are you having a nice day?<eos> It's gonna be.
There are other ways someone can die to us.<eos> No, I'll tell her.<eos> Your mother, Sarafine, is the most powerful Dark Caster of all of us.<eos> She lives in the darkness, in the shadows.<eos> If she does appear, it's in the guise of someone else.<eos> She has no love for you.<eos> That's what I was trying to protect you from.<eos> I'm gonna be claimed for the Dark, no matter what?<eos> No, not necessarily.<eos> I know your true nature, it's strong.
Anything for Verna.<eos> She was a good woman.<eos> Salt of the earth. Though not the most popular in these parts.<eos> I didn't know you were bringing friends.<eos> Is that okay?<eos> Well, it's your house, if you want it.<eos> Just so you know... Verna's trust forbids you from selling it.<eos> It's all described in these papers. Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You can't quite see the house from here. But it's just up beyond those trees.
Shoot the fuck. Kill him!<eos> Pull the trigger, you weak son of a bitch!<eos> He's gonna kill me!<eos> - Oh, God!<eos> - Don't shoot him! Hooper!<eos> Finish what we started!<eos> Can't get around the Good Book, Burt.<eos> Clean this shit up.<eos> Dearest Granddaughter.<eos> This home and all it comes with, is now yours.
Are you insane? It's me.<eos> Is it?<eos> Is it really?<eos> Would you get off me? !<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm sick of you throwing me around.<eos> You see this line?<eos> Do not come into my personal...<eos> Did you not see the line?<eos> 'Cause I was pretty clear that it's right...
There's just no other way... - Ah!<eos> No! - Ah!<eos> Decontamination complete.<eos> - What is that?<eos> - Ow! It's a map, you idiot.<eos> A map!<eos> Will it lead us to the time machine?<eos> They aren't just gonna write time machine on the...<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Where is it?
No! - Ah!<eos> Decontamination complete.<eos> - What is that?<eos> - Ow! It's a map, you idiot.<eos> A map!<eos> Will it lead us to the time machine?<eos> They aren't just gonna write time machine on the...<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Where is it?<eos> It's, uh...
- No, my name is Karolius.<eos> Herald of the dark light.<eos> Just a moment.<eos> I'm receiving something strong.<eos> It's...<eos> - No, it's you.<eos> - That could be a sock I...<eos> No.<eos> Your aura.<eos> It's powerful.
Do you want an autograph or something?<eos> Release the lady!<eos> - You?<eos> - You?<eos> I knew it!<eos> Hey, you, henchmen, get them. And make it quick!<eos> - I surrender.<eos> - Stop!<eos> I have a sword.<eos> And it is very sharp.
- So why don't you come and get it?<eos> Very honourable.<eos> You move well.<eos> Just like him.<eos> Don't even think about mentioning his name.<eos> Wait, wait!<eos> I only want the return of the knights.<eos> You and me are alike.<eos> Join my cause.<eos> It's an honourable one.
His body... figure, leg, foot excel against the finest.<eos> His manners might improve, but there is time.<eos> Now... have you dined already?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But Nurse, I knew all this before.<eos> What says he of our marriage?<eos> What of that?<eos> Lord, how my head aches.<eos> Oh, what a head I have.<eos> It throbs as it would break in 20 bits.
That was someone who robbed you of your childhood.<eos> And this?<eos> Hit Girl? That's not who you are.<eos> You are Mindy Macready and you're just starting high school.<eos> I understand that you don't know who that person is yet, but you will, you've just gotta try.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> You don't know what you want.<eos> You can't. You're not an adult, not yet.<eos> Yeah, well, I've done more in my 15 years than most adults have in their lifetime.<eos> That note that your father gave you, the one that you were supposed to open if anything ever happened. What did it say?
Good morning.<eos> Good morning, friends.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Now before I get started, I promised Mr. Roberts that I would mention that we still need a few volunteers to help us set up for tomorrow's summer festival, so if you have a little extra time and want to lend a helping hand,<eos> please see Carl after the service.<eos> Please be seated.<eos> I have spent a lot of years here with you and I would like to believe that through all those years we have built a community of love and faith.<eos> I would also like to believe that we have learned to trust each other.<eos> Now trust is a very funny thing.<eos> It requires absolute belief in one's soul, a complete faith.
- And good morning, everyone.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> First of all I would like to thank you for welcoming my family and I into your lives.<eos> When I first received the offer to become your pastor here in Stull, my wife Wendy and I were unsure... unsure about moving a family halfway across the country, unsure about leaving behind a life that we had come to know and understand,<eos> But in times of unsureness, in times of great decision,<eos> I put my faith in the Lord, that He would provide for us, that He had a plan for us.<eos> I think my faith was like a rock.<eos> I was reminded of Matthew, chapter 7, verse 24, which I would like to read to you this morning.<eos> "Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house on a rock.<eos> And the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house. And it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock.
Ray, where you going?<eos> Sir, you have two minutes to exit the premises!<eos> Get back!<eos> Take cover! Take cover!<eos> Hey.<eos> What?<eos> Louis?<eos> Smoked grass, and I'm drinking beer.<eos> And I don't even like beer.<eos> And that pizza, it was delicious.
Hello !<eos> Is there anybody there?<eos> Arise !<eos> Get to the back.<eos> Take off your shoes .<eos> I want to go with my mom ...<eos> Mom ...<eos> And Prince ...<eos> 00:13:55,500 -- 00:13:57,755 the prince wanted to marry a princess.<eos> But it had to be a real princess .
By the way, I know how he did that trick.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Shrike.<eos> So, when he was 14, he saw a hole in a tree in Central Park.<eos> He had a guy who worked at the carousel sign a card for what looked like a routine little trick.<eos> And?<eos> At the guy's retirement, 18 years later,<eos> Shrike performs, has the guy sign a card, and presto!<eos> The card is in the tree.<eos> It was in the tree for 18 years.
Well, you may be all grown up, but you still get eggshells all over the floor.<eos> Have you outgrown your shoes?<eos> Did you find your birthday present yet?<eos> I found the box, but it was empty.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Did you check?<eos> Check again.<eos> Every year I thought it was my father who left me shoes on my birthday.<eos> But all this time, it's been...<eos> Tell me what it opens.
-Auntie Gin, stay the night here.<eos> You made the evening much nicer.<eos> Oh, thank you, dear.<eos> But an old woman needs time on her own to recover.<eos> Good night, sweet child.<eos> Call me.<eos> Are there any other hotels in town besides the Biltmore?<eos> Even family ties have no meaning when food is scarce.<eos> This one knows there is no room for his brother in the hunt.<eos> While this sibling rivalry may seem cruel, in the end, it is for the best.
Who are you texting?<eos> No one. Just my friend Avery.<eos> Avery. Avery?<eos> Is that a girl's name or a boy's name?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> No, no, it doesn't matter unless it's a boy!<eos> I know what makes you a boy.<eos> You do?<eos> Your bald head.<eos> It's really smooth.
As hard as it is to believe... people in the old world made fun of Mr Wilford.<eos> They critized him for over-engineering... and over-equipping this wonderful train.<eos> But Mr Wilford knew something they did not.<eos> And what was that?<eos> All world people are frigging morons who got turned into popsicles.<eos> Well, sort of.<eos> Mr. Wilford knew that CW7 would freeze the world.<eos> So what did the prophetic Mr Wilford invent? ...to protect the chosen from that calamity?<eos> The Engine!<eos> Rumble rumble, rattle rattle... it will never die!
Just give us your address, buddy.<eos> We'll get you a good night's sleep, a nice cup of coffee. Dude, that's not gonna work.<eos> You gotta shake him. - What?<eos> - Wake up, asshole!<eos> - Tell us where you live. - Didn't you...?<eos> I know that you're in there and I know that you can hear me.<eos> - Didn't you have his address?<eos> - Yeah, I do, uh...<eos> It's back at his apartment, though.<eos> All right, well, maybe it's in his wallet?
It won't take long before the bail will be granted.<eos> But don't worry, John, you're not alone.<eos> I'm gonna do everything in my power to help you get clear of this.<eos> And you just want to send a single rose?<eos> A single rose and... this photograph.<eos> Would you be so kind as to remove all the thorns, before sending it over?<eos> You can count on it, yeah.<eos> The funny thing about memory... is that it can't be fully trusted.<eos> And yet, in the end, it's the only truth we have.<eos> And no matter how painful it is, you gotta look at the truth... because sometimes... it's the only thing that can save you.

- Genitals. That's genitals.<eos> Okay. Um. Yeah, um, my secret?<eos> Well, you know what I do, Don?<eos> I just treat Rose like she's a stripper.<eos> - No kidding?<eos> - No kidding. Like she's a dirty, dirty stripper.<eos> Heh-heh-heh. Dirtier the better.<eos> - Okay, watch your step.<eos> It surprise...<eos> It sneaks up on you.
No, we didn't.<eos> I came back the next morning.<eos> - First thing.<eos> And I had to poke her with a stick to wake her.<eos> You know, I once went to this luau-themed party. I'm sorry.<eos> No, please.<eos> You were talking...<eos> No, you go.<eos> Tell your story, babe.<eos> No, it's dumb.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, you're going to have to take off.<eos> I'm getting complaints.<eos> You're having too much fun. It's making everyone uncomfortable.<eos> I'm just kidding.<eos> That wasn't even my best stuff.<eos> Are you for real?<eos> I can tell you're in complete awe of our picnic table.<eos> It is one-of-a-kind except for the 200 other ones here that are exactly like it.
What can you tell me about him?<eos> He's a good guy.<eos> Gets his haircut at Doc's, so he's okay by me.<eos> Where does he live?<eos> I answered the question. I told you where I got the ring.<eos> That was the deal.<eos> I ain't gonna start giving out information to some guy who just pops up at my house.<eos> Now give me the damn ring.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> It's mine.
Fuck 'em.<eos> You'll find a better job.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I made a mistake. I wasn't thinking straight.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Where's the box?<eos> Open it.<eos> You like it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's beautiful.
You think you're pretty smart, don't you?<eos> It's all right. I'm not offended about those things you said about my ancestors.<eos> Totally cool with it.<eos> You should see your ancestors.<eos> u-g-ly.<eos> But you know that every fossil tells a story and this tooth tells a pretty good one.<eos> So go ahead and pick it up.<eos> Come on, come on, pick it up.<eos> Pick it up, pick it up!<eos> Come on, it won't bite you.

Of course, if you're familiar with the Cretaceous Period, you probably know all of this.<eos> Now watch closely.<eos> This is a delicate operation, best left to the professionals.<eos> Ah, the enticing smell of decay.<eos> Look at this tartar build-up. Mmm!<eos> Hey, watch it!<eos> I'm telling you, it's hard out here for a bird!<eos> But enough about me.<eos> The story you're about to see concerns a friend of mine.<eos> I gotta say, it's a pretty good one, filled with mystery and adventure hope and despair.
A Gorgosaur's?<eos> Looks to be.<eos> Uncle Zack?<eos> Hey, Ricky.<eos> Come see what we found.<eos> Uncle Zack look, the tooth!<eos> Ricky, did you bring it?<eos> Here it is.<eos> - Cool! - Wow!<eos> That's it, it fits!
I see you left your hormone spigot running, griddle boy.<eos> Crank it shut. This is a church.<eos> I know it's a church.<eos> I have a brain, you know.<eos> You know why I call you Pooh Bear?<eos> Because I'm so cuddly.<eos> Because his head is full of stuffin'<eos> Now listen to me, odd one.<eos> I don't want you going back to that creepy room again.<eos> It doesn't exist anymore.

Why he blames me or who the hell killed him is a little hazy.<eos> If I'm caught, I'll either be arrested for murder or rolling what looks like the biggest joint ever.<eos> It's just me, Rosalia!<eos> Damn it.<eos> Oh, give me a break.<eos> It's just me, again, Rosalia.<eos> I'm gonna borrow your car again, okay?<eos> If I'm being framed, why the police have failed to arrive and arrest me... or the murderer hasn't come to kill me, I do not know.<eos> All right, Bob, where can I put you to quietly decompose for a while... before someone finds you and has a new love of Jesus scared into em?<eos> Interesting story, Bob. After the federal government abandoned this prison... it went through a long series of owners.
Never heard you make that sound before.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What are you looking at?<eos> Fingers.<eos> Please say they're attached to someone's hand.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Get out of there, Oddie.<eos> Someone has been buying a lot of Burke and Bailey's.<eos> Well, you tell whoever's buying it that our ice cream... may be the best, but it'll still melt in hell.
I have never obstructed justice.<eos> Because people have got to know whether or not their president's a crook.<eos> Well, I'm not a crook.<eos> I've earned everything I've got.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Right there.<eos> Ah!<eos> If you guys weren't neighbors, I'd put that chair on your bill, Bert.<eos> Fuck you, Hilly.<eos> This table, it tilts.
- Bastard won't tell me.<eos> All right.<eos> I guess we're just gonna hang out.<eos> Yep.<eos> See you tonight.<eos> This is good for you.<eos> "The Ramones are the apotheosis of punk."<eos> Frank Rose again.<eos> "They are an acknowledgment of the failure of glitter." That they are.<eos> "Brevity is the soul of wit, and it is right at the heart of the Ramones' music.
Choke me with it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Yeah, tell me.<eos> I'm choking you with the cat.<eos> Tell me. Keep telling me.<eos> I've got its tail. I'm choking you with the cat's tail.<eos> Yeah, you are.<eos> Oh, fuck, tell me!<eos> I'm choking you, and its tail is around your neck.<eos> - And it's so tight around your neck.
- Okay.<eos> - Yeah, tell me.<eos> I'm choking you with the cat.<eos> Tell me. Keep telling me.<eos> I've got its tail. I'm choking you with the cat's tail.<eos> Yeah, you are.<eos> Oh, fuck, tell me!<eos> I'm choking you, and its tail is around your neck.<eos> - And it's so tight around your neck.<eos> - Yeah, it is. It's so tight, yes!
If you just knew.<eos> If you just would then I could tell you... and then nobody's have to know it, except for you and me.<eos> And Darl.<eos> You all right?<eos> Where she gonna go?<eos> Do you think she'll still go as far as town?<eos> She went farther than town.<eos> She's in upside down.<eos> Told you she loved that dress.<eos> Don't want it wrinkled.
Three, the water will have to seep in at a slant.<eos> Water moves easiest up and down than sideways.<eos> Four, in a house were people are upright two thirds of the time... the seams and joints are built up and down... because the stress is up and down.<eos> Five, in a bed where people lay down all the time... the joints and seams go sideways because the stress is sideways.<eos> Six, except.<eos> Seven... a human body is not like a crosstie.<eos> Eight, animal magnetism.<eos> Nine, the animal magnetism of a human body... makes the stress come slanting... so a coffin is built on the bevel.<eos> Ten, if you look at an old grave site... you'll see where the earth is sucked towards the bevel.<eos> Eleven, while on a natural hole... it sinks toward the middle, the stress being up and down.
Oh, I don't know.<eos> Maybe for times like these?<eos> Here, try this soap.<eos> Look, he's a great kid, and you're clearly a great, mildly compulsive, woman.<eos> Take the leap!<eos> I'm sorry, who's mildly compulsive?<eos> Why do you run around fixing everyone else's life?<eos> What about yours?<eos> My life is fine, thank you very much.<eos> It's frigging great.
I go for my cutlass...<eos> It Shoots its pincer.<eos> Right to my shoulder.<eos> Next thing I know, we're over the cliff.<eos> Falling.<eos> 30m.<eos> Straight down.<eos> Into the river.<eos> We settle onto the bottom.<eos> It's on top of me.
And I'm thinking, "wow...<eos> "That's really pretty."<eos> Everything slows down.<eos> I see his pincer through my shoulder.<eos> And I decide:<eos> I don't want that in there anymore.<eos> So I pull it out.<eos> And it lets me go.<eos> And more than that I can tell...<eos> It can't find me.

I'd say he stole it.<eos> That's why I need a new one.<eos> Where are you off to now?<eos> Sitting down.<eos> He even sleeps with that stupid letter.<eos> He's memorized it word for word.<eos> I didn't think he could memorize anything anymore.<eos> Hey, what's with this casserole?<eos> Oh, it's lasagna.<eos> It's still good, take it.
He just needs to replace the compressor that Ed Pegram stole.<eos> Why don't you just go down and get it from him while you're in town?<eos> David, let's go get it.<eos> You boys will do no such thing.<eos> Get yourselves shot for an old piece of garbage?<eos> Am I the only sane one in this family?<eos> Okay, Mom.<eos> But, hey, Ross, I was thinking we could take a drive later, and see Dad's old house.<eos> The old Grant house.<eos> Do you think it's still there?

Porn at your age?<eos> The Nazis and the Holocaust are prizes.<eos> For whom?<eos> Your digital artists?<eos> Well, they have become digital artists, not just technicians.<eos> These are details, trifles, the nitpicking.<eos> I agree with everything except science fiction.<eos> No SF.<eos> This is a stupid kind, in our opinion.<eos> She never did SF and it does not do.
So this is what you'll see if you go to the front page of the website-<eos> This is WikiLeaks, we help you get the truth out.<eos> We want to enable information to go out to the public that has the greatest chance of achieving positive political reform in the world.<eos> To get things to the public you need to protect sources who want to disclose, and you also need to protect your ability to publish in the face of attack.<eos> His thinking is, how can we destroy corruption?<eos> It's the whistle-blower.<eos> Julian Assange is neither a right-wing libertarian nor a standard leftist.<eos> I think he's a humanitarian anarchist.<eos> A kind of John Lennon-like revolutionary, dreaming of a better world.<eos> If we are to produce a more civilized society, a more just society, it has to be based upon the truth...
At that point, I knew that this wasn't some kind of game.<eos> It was for real and that I was going to have to make some very hard choices.<eos> In Star Trek, every prospective commanding officer is expected to pass a test called the "Kobayashi Maru."<eos> Starship Enterprise on training mission to Gamma Hydra.<eos> Alert.<eos> Klingon torpedoes activated.<eos> Alert.<eos> Evasive action!<eos> The test cannot be passed.<eos> It is there to see how they deal with a no-win situation.
And the database that he had access to was a representation of the need for one entity of government to share broadly information about its activities with another agency of government.<eos> How many people had access?<eos> It's a hard question to answer.<eos> Manning was regarded as one of the smartest intelligence analysts in the unit.<eos> But more than others, he became increasingly distressed by the reports he was seeing.<eos> He back-talked a lot.<eos> He constantly wanted to debate.<eos> He wanted to be the person that disagreed with everybody.<eos> We had a separate little conference room.<eos> It had a doorway but it didn't have a door that you could close.
Containment is our priority right now.<eos> We have to neutralize the target before somebody out there sees it.<eos> The mere sight of this thing will 'cause mass panic.<eos> Sir, we have a problem.<eos> Dodd, who shot the amateur video claims it was footage of a giant spider measuring over six feet in length.<eos> We now go live to the scene of this strange sighting.<eos> I saw a big-ass spider.<eos> I came around the corner. First thing I had to do was get my phone out. Ain't nobody gonna believe this...<eos> I seen this spider was coming at me, man.<eos> It had multip... like, what, eight, six legs?

It had multiple eyes.<eos> It was multicultured.
Yeah, about that.<eos> It had multiple legs, dope. It had multiple eyes.<eos> It was multicultured.<eos> The fool's on crack! If I see the spider again, I'm gonna whoop his ass.<eos> Are we ready to the spider?<eos> Yeah!<eos> You better hide your kids, you better hide your wife 'cause there's a big-ass... bigger than a spi... there's a mega-spider on the loose.<eos> Find that building and the connecting service tunnel.<eos> Yes.<eos> It is moving into Stage Three.
Sir, there's a phone call for you.<eos> This is Major Tanner.<eos> Yeah, it's Officer Edwards with the LAPD.<eos> Something down here you're probably going to want to see.<eos> What is your location?<eos> So what is this thing?<eos> It's probably some cross breed of spider.<eos> It's just, like, a gigantic black widow.<eos> Okay, so where would a black widow go?<eos> Well, black widows are night feeders, so it's going to be looking for easy access outside the sewer tunnels, some food supply, not a lot of traffic, calm area, possibly-
No, no, even more isolated. Far away.<eos> Sir, sir.<eos> Far away.<eos> Sir, I think you need to see this.<eos> We have a live feed of Newscopter 8 that has spotted the creature headed toward Little Tokyo.<eos> We advise you that if you are in that area to evacuate immediately.<eos> Or she might go downtown.<eos> Oh, l-look. It's right there.<eos> Found her.<eos> It appears to be climbing up the top of City Hall.

I'll pay for the cord if you actually get it to work.<eos> Well, when you're taking on global corruption... you need a few super powers.<eos> I'm a mathematician by training.<eos> When I was a grad student in Melbourne... I became interested in...<eos> Okay, send us the camera now!<eos> - ...how...<eos> - Excuse me, a little bit more!<eos> I became interested in information...<eos> Okay, switching!<eos> ...and how it flows through society.
And you'll explain them to us?<eos> You understand I won't just be exposing the bank.<eos> They have hundreds of clients from New York to Moscow... who will go to great lengths to hold on to their money.<eos> We understand the risks.<eos> We've got incredible infrastructure.<eos> Hundreds of volunteers, people who've dealt with these threats.<eos> Our process is totally secure.<eos> We don't even know your real name.<eos> You're damn right.<eos> I'll explain the documents, but you never met me... and when the shit comes down, it's on your house.
Thank you.<eos> That was amazing. Genius.<eos> Have you seen Time?<eos> Forbes?<eos> We've got interview requests<eos> - from Larry King, BSkyB... - Julian.<eos> Julian!<eos> What is it?<eos> There's something wrong with the submission platform.<eos> It's disabled.
Son of Poseidon, god of the sea.<eos> Seven years ago, four of these children were headed to Camp Half-Blood... the only place on Earth that is safe for our kind.<eos> Only three of them made it.<eos> We're almost at camp!<eos> Look out!<eos> Grover!<eos> Luke, help him!<eos> Grover, are you okay?<eos> My leg.<eos> It's stuck.
I'm pretty attached to them.<eos> I have to get to the Fleece.<eos> So, what are we supposed to do?<eos> Right.<eos> I know you can breathe under water, Jackson.<eos> But can you breathe like this?<eos> Hi, Brother!<eos> What the--?<eos> The water.<eos> It healed me.
Slow.<eos> More to the left.<eos> Not that far!<eos> Intestine got clipped.<eos> That's just shit you're smelling.<eos> Every day our society abuses the environment.<eos> What's the easiest way to handle that pain?<eos> Never talk about it.<eos> To bury the horror, pretend it isn't real.<eos> If it's real, you have to do something.
It's not my fault.<eos> I just deliver the letters.<eos> I have one for César.<eos> And it comes from Port Said.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Postman!<eos> I'll take it to him.<eos> Bandoloni!<eos> Ange Pietri!<eos> A letter from Port Said!<eos> César, it's heavy.
Come on, Fanny dear, let's reply.<eos> My hand's too thick for a pen, so you write.<eos> We'll do it in the kitchen.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - We're closed, sir.<eos> - Why?<eos> - For reasons of correspondence.<eos> My dear child...<eos> I receive your first letter at last.<eos> It's not a long one.
He's a bit tired today.<eos> That's no way to do things.<eos> - I forgot my matches. - Wait.<eos> That was very kind of you.<eos> A match held by such pretty hands.<eos> Don't call my hands pretty.<eos> They're so tiny and dainty.<eos> They're slender, they're warm.<eos> - With a pretty ring. - You like it?<eos> Is it gold?
Where are your sunglasses?<eos> Mine fell in the koi pond.<eos> It's not a big deal.<eos> No, it is to me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You got to take it to the hole, sir.<eos> I probably shouldn't have said anything.<eos> You want your first time to be special, beautiful.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And so it will be.
Your brother went off on a job with a man named Melander.<eos> Do you know how fucking connected I am, chief?<eos> They took money that belongs to me.<eos> Tell me where they are and I'll get out of your hair.<eos> Do you have any concept of the unholy shitstorm you're about to unleash by fucking with me?<eos> First I should tell you, when I say I'll do something,<eos> I always follow through. Always.<eos> FUCK you!<eos> If you don't tell me what I need to know<eos> I'm going to press down on this chair until it crushes your trachea.
I don't want to lose you.<eos> I keep thinking about that man inside our house.<eos> I've been around thieves my whole life, but this guy...<eos> He really scared me.<eos> They wouldn't have killed you, Claire.<eos> They'd use you to get to me.<eos> Then killed us both.<eos> You can leave, Claire. No one would blame you.<eos> This Italianate villa was built three years ago.<eos> It's only $17 million.
We will verify .<eos> - It is in this direction.<eos> A Lucile not like this.<eos> I think we found something.<eos> Jenson .<eos> See how thin the ice is there?<eos> - Yes<eos> - Snow ...<eos> Yes?<eos> What is it?
- In the trunk with me.<eos> He threw the shovel in here and said he was gonna bury me.<eos> Casey, how hurt is he?<eos> - How hurt is the man?<eos> -He's dead.<eos> He's gonna bury me, Jordan.<eos> - Okay, Casey.<eos> - There's a shovel with me.<eos> I need you to describe that car you're in, okay?<eos> It's black.
But the last ping was off the tower in Santa Clarita Hills.<eos> Tell me where he may have taken her.<eos> There is no place because Michael wouldn't do something like that.<eos> - Where's this house?<eos> - You have no right.<eos> I have a right to arrest you for obstruction.<eos> Where is the house?<eos> - That's where Michael grew up.<eos> - But where is it?<eos> It's gone. It's gone. It burned down years ago.

The piano doesn't need restoration.<eos> Quite so.<eos> We have to check it but there's no key.<eos> But here it is.<eos> Last time there was no key. Looks good.<eos> Mr Oldman!<eos> Would you help me with the bookcase?<eos> Italian bookcase, wood. First half of...<eos> Who smashed this?<eos> Nobody, Mr Oldman, it was already broken.
What is she so afraid of?<eos> Shut up!<eos> is your guy pretending to be happy?<eos> Or smiling for real?<eos> Hes definitely pretending to smile.<eos> Thats like half of them.<eos> Does yours look like shes had really bad plastic surgery?<eos> No, its not Susan.<eos> Listen, it says here that hypnosis is used sometimes to treat mental illnesses.<eos> But it doesnt trigger it.
Whats wrong?<eos> Alicia.<eos> Whats happening?<eos> Spanish.<eos> Whats she saying?<eos> Speak Spanish!<eos> Whats going on!<eos> Can you explain! ?<eos> She says its not what it looks like...<eos> Her soul is being purified it will come back to her body and she will regain consciousness...
And then, if the whole humanity get enlightened the Earth changed.<eos> The planet of sand start to grow plant, animals, be like a paradise.<eos> Dune is a Messiah of the planets because is a planet with consciousness.<eos> With the same consciousness of Paul.<eos> And the planet go to the universe to illuminate the other planets.<eos> I changed the end of the book, evidently!<eos> In the book, it's a continuation.<eos> The planet never changed.<eos> Is not awake, with a cosmic consciousness.<eos> It's not a Messiah, the planet.
Is that true?<eos> No, that is not true.<eos> - It's not true?<eos> - No.<eos> Do you have any money?<eos> But my aunt and my uncle, they live here, and they're waiting for us.<eos> Here at this address?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, apparently they didn't show, and this address doesn't exist.<eos> It's not valid.

And I hate myself.<eos> I'm sorry, Ewa.<eos> Don't hate me.<eos> I want you.<eos> Why do you say no to me?<eos> I want you to love me.<eos> Ewa, Ewa, Bruno loves you.<eos> Excuse me, do you know this address?<eos> Excuse me, Do you know this address?<eos> Does it exist?
Motherfuckers!<eos> We're almost home, buddy!<eos> My name's Alan and I bought a giraffe!<eos> He's all mine!<eos> He's super friendly!<eos> Look at the giraffe.<eos> Oh, my God. Where do you think it's going?
People are starving in 12.<eos> Here, they're just throwing it up to stuff more in.<eos> Katniss? Peeta.<eos> This is Plutarch Heavensbee.<eos> Successor to Seneca Crane.<eos> That's a tough act to follow.<eos> Peeta! May I?<eos> Please.<eos> So how do you like the party?<eos> It's a little overwhelming.

We need to talk.<eos> Where are we gonna run away?<eos> Into the woods. Like we always talked about.<eos> If we leave right now, we can be far away from here by tonight.<eos> Yeah, who's "we"?<eos> You, me and your fiancé?<eos> It's not just me and Peeta any more.<eos> Snow threatened to have you killed.<eos> Anyone else?<eos> Well, he didn't exactly give me a copy of the list but a good guess, it includes both of our families.
Breakfast?<eos> You have to try one.<eos> Hey, give me a three-quarter-inch ratchet wrench.<eos> Ratchet wrench.<eos> That day, Frank changed the oil in the car and replaced the fuse for the blinkers.<eos> Then he replaced the filter on the furnace.<eos> He checked out the cord of firewood that just got delivered and informed my mom that the guy was shorting her.<eos> Then he washed the floor and waxed it.<eos> Then you rotate the ball. Grip it loose. Two fingers up top, thumb on the bottom.<eos> Just let it rest there.
Just got a little problem with an Austrian rat and his team of Italian cheats<eos> - who have destroyed my car.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> I'm talking about the race in Spain that I won.<eos> - Yeah, in a car which is not legal.<eos> - Five-eighths of an inch too wide.<eos> You know that doesn't have the slightest effect on speed.<eos> But you complained and your team of lawyers leaned on the authorities.<eos> Now we've had to rebuild the car, and it's become a monster.<eos> - At least it's a legal monster.
We were just closing up about the audio commentary piece.<eos> Yeah, shit idea.<eos> It was a shit idea then. Still a shit idea.<eos> It didn't age well.<eos> We appreciate your candor.<eos> We had a different view of it here though.<eos> Musicians for the most part are pretty much... monosyllabic teenagers who really don't have much to say... and that's the good ones, right?<eos> So what are we doing here?<eos> The music industry is fine.<eos> It's always going to be fine.
On the air in... 10, 9, 8 ...<eos> My guest tonight has dominated this week's headlines.<eos> He is to science what Mozart is to music.<eos> T.S. Spivet, just 10 years old, and he had sprinted ahead of legions of scientists to win this year's coveted Baird Award.<eos> T.S., you're 10 years old, You're an orphan, you grew upon a remote ranch in Montana, your dad wanted you to be a cowboy.<eos> Am I right so far?<eos> Coppertop Ranch, 4.73 miles north of the Divide, 14.92 miles ...<eos> Tell me T.S., How does a 10 year old win the Baird Award?<eos> Did the proverbial apple just fall on your head and light bulb, you invent the perpetual motion machine?<eos> It actually already existed.
They're trying to learn to swim.<eos> If they succeed and get to the mainland they will destroy monuments all around the world including the one monument your food storm didn't destroy.<eos> Not Lady Liberty!<eos> I've gotta destroy the FLDSMDFR. But how?<eos> Well, my Thinkquanauts have invented this.<eos> The BS-USB.<eos> Or BSUSB.<eos> A Bifurcating Systematic Universal Stop Button!<eos> Precisely.<eos> It would destroy the machine and everything it created.
- Food that cannot love!<eos> - Flint we should be studying the food animals, not killing them.<eos> What if he's wrong?<eos> The choice is yours, son.<eos> Live up to your full potential or walk away and let the food monsters destroy Lady Liberty.<eos> Sam, finding that FLDSMDFR and saving the world that's what matters.<eos> Really?<eos> Our opinion doesn't matter?<eos> Of course it does!<eos> Yes! Yes, it matters.
Yeah.<eos> Get yourself some decent clothes.<eos> You look like a bag lady.<eos> I wouldn't be here, I wouldn't have clone all this unless I absolutely loved Death Race.<eos> So I'm speaking to the millions of fans around the globe.<eos> Fear not.<eos> I am like you.<eos> I seek not to destroy nor to compromise what we've all come to revere.<eos> The Death Race that we all know and love will not change.<eos> It will grow bigger and better.
I spoke to Weyland.<eos> I'm here to help you.<eos> Blueprints, electrical systems, ventilation shafts.<eos> Now, how would your little copycat event play without the game's marquee star?<eos> It's a man in a mask.<eos> How would the fans know which one was real?<eos> That's why you're going to fail.<eos> The boy wonder billionaire will become the laughing stock.<eos> The Death Race that you all know and love will not change.<eos> It will grow bigger and better.
The nuclear industry is a death industry.<eos> It's a cancer industry.<eos> It's a bomb industry.
The nuclear industry is a death industry.<eos> It's a cancer industry.<eos> It's a bomb industry.<eos> It's killing people and will for the rest of time.
This is not somebody's calculations on a piece of paper.<eos> This is real.<eos> We know how to do these things.<eos> Now, let me frame this debate, if I may, by reading a letter from the President of the United States, sent to me yesterday.<eos> "Thank you for your letter supporting our decision to terminate the Department of Energy's Advanced Liquid Metal Reactor program including the Integral Fast Reactor.<eos> I want to assure you that this administration does not support the IFR and will oppose any effort to continue the funding for this reactor project.<eos> Democrats have gotten themselves on the wrong side, in my opinion, in this issue.<eos> Being opposed to nuclear power, for, I think, no good reason other than it's very high on the list of what Republicans like.<eos> We know that nuclear energy is clean.<eos> We know that it doesn't pollute the air.

We found some bean soup that was spoiled.<eos> And we ate it. We found it in an old house. And we all got sick there.<eos> You all got sick.<eos> Yes.<eos> I was already sick in the prison.<eos> My feet were swollen again and I couldn't walk properly.<eos> And from there we set off for Mytilini.<eos> And we got near. But in the sea our inflatable boat started losing its air.<eos> And you didn't have a boat.<eos> We did until we got there. We were five hundred meters away when it completely deflated.
It is prohibited, on pain of retribution, to dig up mud, clay, sand or marl for the construction or reinforcement of buildings, paths and cattle tracks, fields, meadows and gardens or whatever else.<eos> In the royal hunting grounds it is prohibited to bring down game, birds or any other creatures, to plunder nests for eggs, and to make use of the royal waters for fishing, retting flax, irrigation of land or any other purpose whatsoever.<eos> No one is permitted to avail themselves of dry, green, cut or uncut wood standing or lying in forests, enclosures or flowing water, nor to possess themselves of kindling, acorns, beech mast or other fruits of the woods, tree-bark for tanning,<eos> wild fruit, berries, mushrooms, and so forth.<eos> The keepers and wardens have been instructed to report any violations of this decree to their superiors forthwith and to ensure that any offence against the laws of the forest be punished severely, in accordance with the edicts of the state...<eos> What higher aspiration can there be than to join forces and seek a path on which to escape from tyranny and heartlessness?<eos> Olm is a true friend.<eos> I have learned so much from him.<eos> Now I understand where wrongdoing and hardship have their origins, not in God, but in our own hearts.<eos> Freedom is not the opposite of captivity. It is a holy right vouchsafed to us all.
It's a sign, all right.<eos> But still no sign of Jakob.<eos> How often has that louis d'or scorched my skin like hell fire!<eos> A thousand times I have asked myself whether the value of freedom can be expressed in gold coin.<eos> Such questions torment my tremulous heart.<eos> Even my friend Olm, so contemptuous of the clergy and the Prussian king, beseeches me to hold out with him and not to pay money for something that is priceless.<eos> He says a sign from Heaven will come and warn us that liberty is nigh, that mother to us all, seated on a throne more precious than gold.<eos> Is it the end of the world, pastor?<eos> On the second day of March 1843, the comet will attain such brightness as to be visible by day.<eos> It belongs to the Kreutz group and its tail has the extraordinary length of two astronomical units.
We live more than once.<eos> He who has weathered the stormy waves of life will gladly follow me to the thickened forests, through the endless steppes and across the mighty backs of the Andes.<eos> And the worldly spirit will tell him:<eos> In the pursuit of science is freedom.<eos> Father! I have the answer!<eos> - We must build a centrifugal governor.<eos> - A what? A centrifugal governor.<eos> It's in this book.<eos> Look. "Centrifugal force activates a joint-and-lever mechanism "that throttles the steam pressure when the machine starts running too fast.<eos> "Otherwise it would rotate at maximum speed until it destroyed itself."
Think about it.<eos> How old are you?<eos> In your line of work, why have you lived so long?<eos> Your partners knew about self-sacrifice for the greater good.<eos> Not you, though.<eos> You know what you are?<eos> Vengeance.<eos> You are vengeance.<eos> And vengeance never dies.<eos> It only changes targets.
Oh, or else that.<eos> Nice try, flame bag, but now you're trapped here with me for the next billion years.<eos> I've saved the entire world!<eos> And no one will ever know.<eos> Uh, yes, hi.<eos> I'm from the vampire bank that burned down.<eos> I have what remains of the contents of a safe deposit box belonging to a Bender B. Rodriguez.<eos> Ah, thank you.<eos> Bender's medal.<eos> It melted in the fire.
Still don't trust me, huh?<eos> Well, you can take your lack of trust and jam it in your kidney hole.<eos> The only person I trust is myself.<eos> Help! I forgot my magnetic shoes!<eos> Just stay out of my way, boy.<eos> There. Who needs teamwork when you got Bender?<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> Help! My gyroscope melted!<eos> I'm out of control!<eos> If the creature kills me, I just hope it doesn't make me into a sandwich and leave it in the fridge where some crawfish can get at it.
Huh, I should be mad, but it worked pretty well.<eos> You were really brave, Leela.<eos> And you seriously nailed that thing with your golf shot.<eos> Fry, you saved my ass out there.<eos> Aw, I couldn't let anything happen to something that shiny.<eos> And, Dr. Zoidberg, it was your quick thinking...<eos> Uh, yup.<eos> Bad news, everyone.<eos> The creature is a shape-shifter.<eos> It knocked me out and took my form so it could prey on poor Hermes.
Uh, yup.<eos> Bad news, everyone.<eos> The creature is a shape-shifter.<eos> It knocked me out and took my form so it could prey on poor Hermes.<eos> I weren't fooled.<eos> The real Professor wun't never've...<eos> Dern.<eos> Bad news, everyone.<eos> The creature is a shape-shifter.<eos> It knocked me out and took my form so it could prey on poor Hermes and Scruffy.
Ma'am.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Ma'am, your card was declined.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Here, use this one.<eos> That one's done.<eos> Great.<eos> Hi. Good morning.<eos> Something wrong with pump five.<eos> It's not taking my card.
100%.<eos> 100%.<eos> To you.<eos> You know what they say about grasshoppers?<eos> Hard on the outside and soft and creamy on the inside.<eos> I always like soft and creamy.<eos> I'm soft and creamy.<eos> I know you are.<eos> Why don't we go make sure that table's okay?<eos> Looks like it's in danger.
You taught me about getting what you want, and you taught me about confidence.<eos> Maybe a little bit too much about confidence.<eos> Did you see me with that poor Ken Talbott today?<eos> Yeah, you were pretty hard on him.<eos> I know.<eos> But people have been hard on me my whole life, and I just don't want to feel like the chump anymore.<eos> And you showed me that.<eos> Did I?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You also completely messed up my life, but I guess it needed a little messing up, needed a little bit more Diana in it.
You say that with pride.<eos> I say it as fact.<eos> If this conversation concerns what is factual and what is not, then it must be said that there is no justice nor righteousness in their slavery.<eos> But you do open up an interesting question.<eos> What right have you to your niggers, when you come down to the point?<eos> What right?<eos> I bought them.<eos> I paid for them.<eos> Of course you did, and the law says you have the right to hold a nigger.<eos> But begging the law's pardon, it lies.
I've been there myself.<eos> Montreal... and Kingston and Queenston and a great many places.<eos> Well-traveled for a slave.<eos> How came you here?<eos> Master Bass... if justice had been done, I never would have been here.<eos> How's this?<eos> Tell me all.<eos> I'm afraid to tell you.<eos> Every word you speak is a profound secret.<eos> Your story... it is amazing.
Nothingness?<eos> Diagnosis:<eos> Induced delirium.<eos> A mistake.<eos> The disintegration of his conscious state has encircled him with maleficent definitions.<eos> All external stimuli of feelings and memory are indistinguishable from one another.<eos> A phantasm.<eos> In the initial stages, reality is indistinguishable from dreams.<eos> Delirium.<eos> Soon afterwards, it becomes one with them.
But they got to have vacuums.<eos> Think that was an oriole.<eos> I didn't know we had those.<eos> Wait here.<eos> You didn't wait.<eos> Where's Josh?<eos> He took a walk.<eos> The disaster we see is happening everywhere at the same time.<eos> The clock is ticking.<eos> It has been ticking for 150 years now, since the dawn of industrialization.
We're all alone now.<eos> So what happens?<eos> Do we go on?<eos> I was on a plane, a transatlantic flight, when the mission feed went dark.<eos> When I landed, Mission Control was still saying<eos> "Maybe it's just a transmission delay."<eos> But, by the time I made it into Mission Control, we were looking at over 15 hours of dead feed.<eos> After James was lost, the joy of the mission, the exhilaration of it all just... it just left.<eos> I stopped feeling like a kid on a family trip.<eos> The mission has stretched on ahead of us, somehow longer than it had been before.
- Daniel.<eos> - What?<eos> What are you doing, buddy?<eos> What's happening?<eos> - You lost something?<eos> - I lost my toothbrush.<eos> - What?<eos> - He's unpacking his entire bunk.<eos> You lost your toothbrush?<eos> What color is it, man?
She must have been out there for an hour.<eos> But it... it felt like an eternity.<eos> Each minute seemed to divide and divide again into endless moments.<eos> First sample ready for scan.<eos> Sending data back to you now.<eos> Are you reading?<eos> Running analysis, stand by.<eos> We're negative for trace carbon and chemotropic processes.<eos> Can you try ice with more trace rust?<eos> You could feel... every minute is somehow longer than it had ever been before.
Would you have treated her differently if she was a man?<eos> Gene.<eos> That's not what happened.<eos> Maybe it's time for you to slow down.<eos> Your client load is down.<eos> Get some cheaper space.<eos> Focus on what's going on with you.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> I received a letter, Jon.<eos> I haven't shared it with anyone, but I think it will likely surface.
Why are they writing this?<eos> Their daughter committed suicide and left a very graphic note, naming me.<eos> It never happened.<eos> Look.<eos> It's not unusual for there to be emotional transference between a patient and a therapist.<eos> Had her perform oral sex in your car?<eos> Never!<eos> It was a fantasy!<eos> Depression can take away your energy.<eos> It can steal away your time.
- What are you talking about? - Quiet.<eos> Chad, your knuckles are dragging.<eos> I'll tell you what's wrong with this picture.<eos> This picture.<eos> Everything else in this pretentious apartment is generic, soulless, like Ryan.<eos> Everything but this photograph. - One of yours, isn't it, Sara?<eos> Ryan blew it up and framed it for you, right?<eos> It's haunting.<eos> Really disturbing.<eos> It's beautiful.
There are two approaching armies, hunger and fatigue, but a great wall keeps them at bay.<eos> The wall extends to the sky and will stay up until I say otherwise.<eos> Each drink is better than the last, leaving you with the desire to have one more.<eos> Take a drink now.<eos> The next drink must be earned and I'm going to tell you how.<eos> Focus closely on my instructions.<eos> I will ask you to repeat them from memory.<eos> One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand, four one thousand.<eos> The water has lost its appeal.<eos> It doesn't seem as enticing as before.
Let me see.<eos> You Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> At least it wasn't my good side.<eos> I sent your package.<eos> I have your tracking number.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hello, Victor.<eos> Hello.<eos> Go take off your dress, it's covered in blood.
My name is Jesse ben Benjamin and with your permission, I'd like to treat you today.<eos> Call me Qasim.<eos> Can I give you something for the pain, Qasim?<eos> Can I still talk to you then?<eos> No, the opium does dull the senses.<eos> Then I respectfully decline your generous offer.<eos> I fall off the ladder.<eos> The ladder?<eos> The ladder my soul must ascend to heaven.<eos> It is very long and it is easy to fall off.
Let's look.<eos> I think it's a boy.<eos> Um, maybe.<eos> I mean, that could be a thumb, right?<eos> Whose is it?<eos> It's hers, of course.<eos> What is it?<eos> I can't handle my dad.<eos> You've got a time bomb in there.<eos> It's gonna go off.
Very natural.<eos> The body knows what to do.<eos> Just go with the body.<eos> Are you frightened?<eos> You're not going to experience this death of yours.<eos> He will.<eos> I'll be dead.<eos> (sighs)<eos> What about the pain?<eos> The pain will never be too much, but when it is,
I think you're up to here.<eos> Well, it shouldn't be that hard.<eos> I'll show you.<eos> See?<eos> It's easy.<eos> I don't even know how it got in there.<eos> Can you feel it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How do you afford your lakeside mansion, al?<eos> I wouldn't know how much it's worth.
The we ordered, because he likes marzipan cake.<eos> Otherwise we pie with whipped cream.<eos> Marzipan sits in their teeth.<eos> What we do with it?<eos> Here I am with a big cake.<eos> I want a black forest cake, but it's not me who's birthday.<eos> Call when he gets back.<eos> The cases are always quickly solved.<eos> Is he jumped out the window?<eos> It was open when we sang this morning.

- Just find the suitcase, damn it!<eos> - Yeah, okay.<eos> - What do you mean? Is this a problem?<eos> - No, I think of the old.<eos> - What should I do about him?<eos> - Do what you normally do: tru.<eos> This is a threat!<eos> If someone does something, pegs I knob of them.<eos> Hit with a suitcase!<eos> It is in the kitchen.
We've had the tests back from Paynter's body.<eos> He was drugged.<eos> That's why he didn't cry out when his head was put in the fire.<eos> The drug was very specific.<eos> Gelsemine. Gelsemine?<eos> Non. What is it?<eos> You recall the scientific researches of Madame Olivier?<eos> They are concerned principally with the nervous system.<eos> In small quantities gelsemine is used to treat the heart.<eos> In large quantities it induces paralysis and immobilisation of the nervous system.
And these two?<eos> Li Chang Yen is as innocent as he claims.<eos> And these poor unfortunate souls are merely pawns in the game, kidnapped and kept here, their disappearances orchestrated to throw suspicion onto them.<eos> But why don't they say anything?<eos> Because they are drugged, mon ami.<eos> Drugged with gelsemine.<eos> Good grief.<eos> Oui.<eos> The same drug that was used to anaesthetise Stephen Paynter before he was killed.<eos> They are fully conscious, but their physical paralysis, it is complete.
Of course we are, but...<eos> But why did you go through with this horrid charade, making us believe you'd been killed?<eos> But it was vital, Miss Lemon, vital that you should believe it.<eos> It was necessary for Poirot to disappear, because in this way, the guard of Number Four, it would be dropped.<eos> George?<eos> I'm sure you had the best intentions, sir.<eos> No man is a hero to his valet.<eos> Can you ever forgive me, mes amis?<eos> It was all for the best... ..I suppose.<eos> But you know this affair of the Big Four, it has done some other good.
You left politics when Hesselbo won. What would you do if you were prime minister today?<eos> I always closed press conferences saying:<eos> 'I don't respond to hypothetical questions.'<eos> I have a meeting at 10 with the CEO and the English architect.<eos> You know the board meeting's at 1.30?<eos> Yes, thanks, that's fine.<eos> Your department lost many viewers, Torben.<eos> 150,000 on the major news broadcasts.<eos> I think it's more like 120 or 130. Public television is about making programs that people actually want to watch.<eos> But for me, it's primarily about quality.
But things change.<eos> You really hurt my feelings, guys.<eos> - No hugging... ma'am.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> George Sr. had just discovered that the millions of dollars of American property he owned was worthless.<eos> How did you not notice?<eos> You saw all the papers.<eos> And in Mexico.<eos> You can't expect me to read every page of that deal.<eos> Besides, that one was particularly difficult because it was all in Spanish.
Thought I'd find you in a blouse and a beekeeper hat.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> We cannot be seen next to each other.<eos> I'm Dr. Norman!<eos> Well, if you don't want to be seen, then you go in the sweat lodge.<eos> You owe me.<eos> Is that a fact?<eos> Listen, you told me the property was on the border.<eos> It is 50 feet south of the border, Oscar.
What's up?<eos> Did she say where?<eos> Market Cross.<eos> Don't worry about her, Jimmy.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> I've got two murdered women on my hands that thought they were going to be fine.<eos> Oh, hey!<eos> Calm down. You're overreacting.<eos> Cassie will be all right!<eos> The island's not safe, not until I say it is.
Well, looks like your friends have gone, Sandra.<eos> Are you sure you don't want to catch them up?<eos> Have you lost the house?<eos> Oh, yes. Are you going to stay with James?<eos> No.<eos> No, he doesn't want me.<eos> What will you do?<eos> I have a house.<eos> In Cornwall.<eos> It's not very big, but... it's got furniture.
Where are you?<eos> Call me back.<eos> It looks worse in the daylight.<eos> It's just paint.<eos> Emulsion at that.<eos> I'll get Dad's power jet and have it sorted in an hour.<eos> I won't stay here.<eos> I won't stay to have them burn the house down with me in it.<eos> It's your home.<eos> No. It belongs to the bank.
It's your life.<eos> It's your neighbor who's dead, not mine.<eos> Right? - The flush is broken.<eos> - Well, that was boring.<eos> Gary and Gary.<eos> Lame. - Look what I found in his bathroom.<eos> - You stole a magazine from that poor guy?<eos> - Yeah. - You're such a dickhead.<eos> - He had loads of 'em. It's an old fag rag.<eos> It's kind of good.
It's been a long time since you've driven but you'll have to overcome your fear if you want to save her.<eos> Your wife is very beautiful.<eos> If you want her back, then you will follow my instructions precisely.<eos> If you contact the police, or if you get caught she will die.<eos> You've done very well so far, Mr. Magna.<eos> During the course of this night, you will be given several tasks.<eos> If you fail at any... you will never see your wife again.<eos> How do you like the car?<eos> Do you like it?<eos> It's armored.
Thank you.<eos> You know, um... your room's still available, Rob.<eos> Bye, Rob!<eos> Love you!<eos> Bye, Robyn!<eos> Bye, Diggity!<eos> Good luck!<eos> Don't die out there!<eos> I know you well enough never to ask why you're doing this, or why you want to do it alone.<eos> But I guess if the reason's good enough for you, it's good enough for me.
All kinds of science.<eos> Okay, next through.<eos> Except you.<eos> You go over there.<eos> Why does he have to go over there?<eos> Random check.<eos> He's got to go through the new machine.<eos> What new machine?<eos> It's a new machine.<eos> It detects stuff all the way up your butt.
He equates death with love?<eos> No, not love.<eos> Poe equates death with...<eos> Poe believed that art was about beauty and that nothing was more beautiful than the death of a beautiful woman--<eos> "Helen," "Lenore," "Annabel Lee."<eos> And to bereave beauty is... To elevate one's soul.<eos> Carroll never visited same web address twice, which suggests he's using various URLs.<eos> Who with?<eos> Well, there's the rub.<eos> Every time I access an IP address, it mutates.
Everyone, it's time for the 15th. Annual Regional Spelling Bee to begin.<eos> Take your seats, please. All of our noble contestants.<eos> Please take your seats up on the stage.<eos> Hurry, hurry!<eos> We're on schedule.<eos> I love the way the hush just comes over the crowd before we start.<eos> Here we go.<eos> What are you doing on the stage, weirdo?<eos> Your chair called me for help.<eos> It was saying, "Help me.
I can't change what happened.<eos> All I can do, all I want to do<eos> is leave you with this apology.<eos> This note, which started with me telling you that my feelings were".<eos> What the hell could you possibly write that I would be interested in reading?<eos> There's a bit in there about me being your son.<eos> Son.<eos> And as much as I'd like to hurt your feelings and call you names, they're just words, and it wouldn't change a thing.<eos> That's not what this note was for.<eos> Hopefully it has explained why I did what I did and maybe even have you understand.
It's the only way I know how.<eos> My ex-wife went off and married a big-time movie producer.<eos> So I went out and rented a Malibu pussy pad.<eos> God, if these walls could talk.<eos> They'd tell you to put your clothes back on, you depraved simian.<eos> Depraved or not, I'm living paycheck to paycheck, Hank.<eos> And there are no more paychecks!<eos> What am I gonna do?<eos> Look, I've got an idea.<eos> It's not a particularly good one, and I'm sure I'm gonna suffer as a result.
If you can get me some Peruvian flake,<eos> I'll maybe, possibly think about throwing you in the mix.<eos> One thing of Bolivian flake--done.<eos> Peruvian!<eos> Peruvian flake, you fucking moron!<eos> Any country you want.<eos> - Oh, one more thing.<eos> - Anything. I need you to find me the 1945 Martin D-28 acoustic guitar that used to belong to the childhood friend I buried a few weeks ago.<eos> I'm recording this tribute song for him, and I have to have that fucking guitar.<eos> It was so beautiful.
- Okay.<eos> - All right.<eos> All right, bro, just let me...<eos> - show it to me one more time. - Just keep your fucking voice down.<eos> - Let me see one more.<eos> - Cut the shit, all right?<eos> Holy shit!<eos> And they won't know?<eos> They don't even count it half the time. Jesus, holy shit.<eos> The camera doesn't even see the door when it opens.
You disappoint me, my boy.<eos> I've nothing to do with this girl, and you know it.<eos> Who could have taken this picture?<eos> Who else?<eos> Who other than "it"?<eos> "It" sees everything, you know.<eos> The things we hide, buried things. The dirtiest things.<eos> Not bad, eh?<eos> I didn't take this photo.<eos> This image, it doesn't really belong to you. It belongs to one of your subjects.
Esha!<eos> Yes! She's got friends!<eos> How dare you offer her my sandwiches? !<eos> What now?<eos> "Sharing is caring..."<eos> You should be happy, Aditi!<eos> There's three of them!<eos> One for Bunny, one for me and one for you!<eos> Aditi, please change the song!<eos> It's so boring!
You mean... you're leaving?<eos> Journalism Program...<eos> Accepted at Northwestern University...<eos> Chicago.<eos> Scholarship letter?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yours?<eos> Yeah man... mine.<eos> You're really going?<eos> No I keep the envelope around because it matches my shirt.
He didn't want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King.<eos> Can't say I minded much.<eos> I always hated the politics.<eos> Yeah, I imagine I would, too.<eos> Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings - and betrayals the world over. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Still, she'll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms.<eos> She'll have good men around her to advise her, men with experience.<eos> Which men do you have in mind?<eos> Forgive me, Ser Jorah, for what I'm about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years.<eos> It suffered for a reason.
I'm going to take their home away from them.<eos> Can you do it?<eos> I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home.<eos> There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters.<eos> The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry--<eos> Walder Frey.<eos> He's such a splendid fighter.<eos> Do you have any idea when we might...<eos> I'll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married.<eos> It should grow quickly.
She's one of Craster's wives.<eos> I remember every word of the oath.<eos> Night gathers and my watch begins.<eos> I am the shield that guards the realms of men.<eos> The realms of men.<eos> That means her as well as us.<eos> We didn't build 500 miles of ice walls, 700 feet high to keep out men.<eos> The night is gathering, Maester Aemon.<eos> I've seen it.<eos> It's coming for all of us.
Hey Dynamo!<eos> It's all your fault!<eos> You scattered around the rink not leaving anybody at the cage. You, Spartak, it's you to blame!<eos> Stop that! That's not appropriate!<eos> Stop yelling!<eos> Shut you up!<eos> Hey Spartak, did you score at least one goal tonight?<eos> Everybody to the rink!<eos> Anatoli Vladimirovich, Mikhailov got a dislocated shoulder.<eos> So locate it back where it belongs!
Would you rather I explained to the authorities that the fate of war refugees is in the hands of a junkie?<eos> You can't do this to an old conference colleague!<eos> Have you forgotten that night at the Desmond Tutu conference?<eos> Enough. That night? Yes.<eos> You didn't even bother answering. And I didn't complain. But that was the old Jan<eos> The obedient bitch that begged everyone to like him.<eos> Can you get the coffee Jan? And sort these documents.<eos> While I spend a romantic weekend with my lover.<eos> Know what happened to that bitch?<eos> It died when I got fired from my old job.
Said I'm in a hurry.<eos> Really, crazy.<eos> Look who's here? I never imagined seeing her in a place like this.<eos> I know, at this time, her age ... will take two years to recover!<eos> Fanny and Guillaume, friends of the school of architecture.<eos> Alice is ...<eos> A well-known. Good night.<eos> You want a drink?<eos> -Only my pen drive.<eos> But it's in my home.
Talk to Erdogan, make sure the blood test is ready by 11.<eos> I did.<eos> - And the autopsy results.<eos> - In a week.<eos> - Can't it be done sooner? - It can't be done sooner.<eos> Then why is it possible for the blood results?<eos> Blood alcohol levels are evidence in the case.<eos> And the autopsy is not?<eos> It's not, "Controlia".<eos> It won't show anything new.
I'm divorced too!<eos> I'm sorry. Um...<eos> Is there anything that Sophie can bring to the party?<eos> Can she bring you?<eos> I have no idea how to respond to that.<eos> I know what Mackenzie can bring.<eos> My seven-layer dip.<eos> People go crazy for it.<eos> Spoiler alert:<eos> It actually has eight layers.
Hello, ladies!<eos> You!<eos> Can't be!<eos> We killed you.<eos> Last week.<eos> You actually think two amateurish nitwits could kill The Great Renaldo?<eos> I told you.<eos> You did.<eos> So the leg's not really broken, huh?<eos> No, it is broken, right here.
You actually think two amateurish nitwits could kill The Great Renaldo?<eos> I told you.<eos> You did.<eos> So the leg's not really broken, huh?<eos> No, it is broken, right here.<eos> Just a hairline fracture, though.<eos> No, it's a clean break.<eos> Slight, though.<eos> Slight?<eos> No. It's broken.
The 1929 map is lying to us.<eos> Look.<eos> There is no road here.<eos> But here...<eos> On a 1919 survey, there's a logging route that moves straight through to the capital. The what?<eos> Straight through to the capital.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> How does a road just disappear off a map?<eos> Because it was illegal.<eos> Corrupt officials had it removed so the police wouldn't know it was there.
It is small, what we would call a feather.<eos> Yes.<eos> I think I see it.<eos> So, it is graded what?<eos> A VS1.<eos> Some might grade it higher.<eos> You might grade it higher.<eos> You like this stone?<eos> Oh, I like that stone.<eos> How many carats is it?
Cream of Chris!<eos> Let's go play some hacky sack.<eos> - Got it.<eos> Poor little bunny.<eos> You almost got eaten by a tiger.<eos> I wish I could give you a carrot.<eos> That would be nice.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Storm, I think your wound is getting worse.<eos> It kind of stinks.
We'll do it there.<eos> And they're not going to notice? We act as if it's the most natural thing in the world.<eos> You take this suitcase, Louis, after all, why shouldn't you be my servant?<eos> That's what they'll think.<eos> Sit there, and I'll go and find out if I can get us in.<eos> Sit there?<eos> In full view of everybody?<eos> Of course, the police won't look for him here - you've got to hold your nerve, Sarah.<eos> Bernard, you and your friends are going to play the music for us, are you not?<eos> I will go and see how big the space is, and if it'll suit.
Now I can catch them with this...<eos> And shall I tell you something else, Harry?<eos> I'm going to try to find him.<eos> I'm going to find Louis.<eos> Don't expect it to sell thousands and thousands of copies, Stanley.<eos> Why not?<eos> You don't think people want to hear the truth?<eos> Not as much as when Louis was the culprit.<eos> The other papers reported on it in a very small way, didn't they?<eos> In a few months, I doubt anybody will remember the Jessie Taylor case that clearly. It'll slip away, bit by bit.
Your outfit, your ensemble.<eos> Move it.<eos> Little lab coat?<eos> Yeah. Bought myself this coat.<eos> Very cool.<eos> How was your weekend?<eos> New watch?<eos> Yeah. I splurged.<eos> Oh, cool.<eos> Is it waterproof?
Move!<eos> Move!<eos> Get up!<eos> Move it!<eos> Move it!<eos> Move it!<eos> Get up!<eos> - Explain this.<eos> - It's for his ankle.<eos> It's infected.
It's fucking water.<eos> That's why it won't fucking work.<eos> Who the fuck did this?<eos> Don't tell me you don't fucking know!<eos> I will bust you down to fucking level one.<eos> You want to fuck with me?<eos> Huh? I'll rip you a new fucking asshole.<eos> No more privileges.<eos> No more downtime.<eos> Now push that piece of shit back to the fucking garage where the fuck it belongs.
- Yes, mom.<eos> Dear, you're getting in a live-in relation with him.<eos> Without marriage?<eos> What's the world going to say?<eos> This is my world..<eos> ...that's it.<eos> "I lived only for you."<eos> "I've surrendered myself."<eos> "Your loyalty supported me."<eos> "it cured all my pain."
"Because it's you.. it's you."<eos> "You're my life."<eos> "My relief, my pain."<eos> "You're my love."<eos> "it's you."<eos> "it's you."<eos> "I lived only for you."<eos> "I've surrendered myself."<eos> "Your loyalty supported me."<eos> "it cured all my pain."
Really?<eos> Who's Zoé?<eos> The niece of Madame Bichet, owner of Le Clocher.<eos> Zoé's an actress.<eos> She wants to study acting, so I said she could drop by.<eos> No way.<eos> You know no one attends rehearsal.<eos> I knew you'd react that way.<eos> But you should know, Zoé is an actress in porn films.<eos> She's already done 4 or 5. It sounds like a very interesting job.
Captain Cleanup.<eos> The one that's been missing in action all these years.<eos> What'd you expect at this point in your life, Missy?<eos> Oh, look at them.<eos> They're so cute.<eos> They look like conjoined twins.<eos> Oh, my God, I'm gonna take a picture.<eos> Hey, did Ella finish that apple?<eos> Take food out of your child's mouth? - Yeah.<eos> Well, it's all brown.
Achilleas, Anna.<eos> Hey, you guys.<eos> Hey, look at this kid.<eos> He's having the best summer of us all.<eos> So you were saying there's three characters, right? Not just three.<eos> It's a whole group of people.<eos> I'm working on a chapter about a young Greek man named Achilleas. - Me?<eos> - Well, he's named after you.<eos> The guy is caught in a loop. All he sees is the transient nature of everything.<eos> He looks out at the sea, thinks it's gonna be dry and littered with fossils.
You're coming out of a coma.<eos> You've been in a really bad automobile accident...<eos> But you're gonna be okay.<eos> You're gonna be fine." You know, stuff like that.<eos> She said that every woman, the very first thing... The first reaction she would have, would be to ask about everyone else.<eos> "How are my kids? How's my husband?<eos> Is anyone else hurt?"<eos> Every man, with no exception, when they were told this... What was the first thing they did?<eos> Look down at their cock.<eos> You gotta make sure it's still there.

So, we're making him some glasses?<eos> Indeed we are.<eos> Are you happy?<eos> Yes, thank you.<eos> All is well with Mr. Devereux?<eos> He's feeling much better.<eos> Good!<eos> I wouldn't have missed this, for the world.<eos> I brought your English saddle.<eos> It weighs a ton!
Have you ever met her?<eos> - No, I have not.<eos> - She possessed great beauty.<eos> But believe me, he would not spoil fresh meat.<eos> He loves her too much for that.<eos> I am sure you are telling the truth.<eos> Keep an eye on Saint-Florentin.<eos> He sorely needs it.<eos> Your question seems answered.<eos> It is, you can be sure of that.
He had promised me mountaintops and miracles.<eos> Honour, fortune, and a bright future.<eos> And even his hand. His hand of flesh and bone. And he wouldn't dream of, nor did he want, to get rid of that vile harpy who ate away at him.<eos> Now, thanks to his misconduct, which I no longer profit from, I'm not allowed...<eos> Madam.<eos> Would you have any idea as to the whereabouts of the hand?<eos> Is this an important case?<eos> It is, my Lady.<eos> That hand...<eos> Does it still elude you?
You will go back to Nsukka.<eos> I can't just go back to his house, Auntie.<eos> I am not asking you to go back to his house.<eos> I said you will go back to Nsukka.<eos> Do you not have your own flat and your own job?<eos> Odenigbo has done what all men do and inserted his penis in the first hole he could find when you were away.<eos> Does that mean somebody died?<eos> When your uncle first married me, I worried because I thought all those women outside were coming to displace me from my home.<eos> I now know that nothing he would ever do would make my life change.<eos> My life will change only if I want it to change.
I can't control anymore, I am going in!<eos> Don't stop me!<eos> She is all I can think aboutl!<eos> Then you need to get your thoughts out of your pantsl!<eos> Right now my heart, my thoughts everything is in my pants!<eos> But how will you find her room?<eos> - Very simple.<eos> Moonlight will stream out of her windows...<eos> "because she is the moon itselﬂ!<eos> Hey Romeo, what if it turns out to be her mother's room?
I don't know.<eos> Maybe I oughta just throw in the towel.<eos> Shorten the exit.<eos> I can't do time the way you do it.<eos> I don't do time.<eos> That's what I'm talkin' about.<eos> I can't do time by not doin' time the way you do time.<eos> All that cross-legged shit just make me antsy.<eos> Well, maybe if you didn't judge the experience while<eos> - it was happenin', then you...
Perhaps it's better that way.<eos> Erdogan.<eos> Safe until he isn't, right?<eos> As I say, it's just a feeling.<eos> A premonition.<eos> Call it what you will.<eos> A calamity for justice, of course.<eos> Now, we can fret about it, become indignant, write an angry letter to the newspapers or our Members of Parliament.<eos> Won't make any difference.<eos> Emir's evidence is being heard in closed session and that is where it will remain.
Keep an eye on that bookshop.<eos> If we're lucky, Da Vinci will complete our investigations for us.<eos> And you, Miss Donati, do continue ensnaring Lorenzo and Da Vinci with that... pretty little cunt of yours.<eos> - You're a bastard.<eos> - Yes.<eos> And the architect of my pedigree is the Holy Father himself.<eos> Now, go, lest the prying eyes of Florence see us together and question your already compromised character.<eos> She grows more impertinent with every encounter.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Even a mouse occasionally bears its teeth when it's about to be crushed.
They think I'm a fucking dirt bag. Right.<eos> Just...<eos> relationship.<eos> Let's just go outside for a second.<eos> Come here.<eos> Now just be cool.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> They really don't respect you, do they?<eos> What's wrong with my fucking hair, huh?<eos> I think it looks great, and I don't think you're incompetent.
Like you used to.<eos> Oh, I still do.<eos> I don't need people to like me.<eos> I need them to deliver a good show, and that song...<eos> It's too intellectual.<eos> I like songs that make me feel something, and so do you.<eos> Ah, don't the best do both?<eos> [Chuckles]<eos> This song is the emotional core of the show.<eos> It's a downer.

Um, Julia,<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I tried to make the show we wanted.<eos> - "Tried"?<eos> - Oh, and, Jerry, you truly are what is wrong with American theater.<eos> And, Eileen, you are smarter, classier, and better than your producing partner, and if I were you, I wouldn't agree with a single decision he makes from here on.<eos> Tom.<eos> Oh, Tom.<eos> We've got a long history, haven't we?<eos> - And I am not sorry to say that it ends today.
You just need to find a way to get them there together.<eos> How?<eos> Directors use a variety of methods to get what they want.<eos> If you're not getting the performance you want, find another way.<eos> I shouldn't just wait for them to find it themselves?<eos> First week of rehearsal?<eos> Sure.<eos> Week before tech?<eos> Get in there.<eos> I have an idea, but it isn't pretty.
[Bitter laugh] So you ran off to help Derek?<eos> ! Where are you going?<eos> You should probably stay with your boyfriend tonight.<eos> Bombshell is on the cover of the arts and leisure section, exactly what you wanted.<eos> No producer in their right mind would want that!<eos> I said that Bombshell and Hit list were the theatrical events of the season!<eos> No! You said Hit list was the theatrical event of the season.<eos> You said Bombshell was the past.<eos> Would you rather I didn't write about Bombshell at all?<eos> I have spent a long time getting this thing where it needed to be, and now you do this?
Rent had a narrator after its workshop,<eos> - and they got to Broadway.<eos> - So we'll add a narrator.<eos> Oh, wait, no, we won't, because that is a terrible idea.<eos> We don't need to spell out our theme.<eos> Don't listen to him.<eos> He's not good with feedback.<eos> - We'll do whatever you want.<eos> - Like, seriously.<eos> If you nod your head any harder, it is going to pop off of your body.
Our host wants to see you.<eos> Bing?<eos> Now?<eos> Where is he?<eos> I had to get you alone.<eos> Do you always get what you want?<eos> I haven't told you what I want yet.<eos> How about I never do...<eos> And you have to guess?<eos> Outside of this room, there's a cold war but you'd never know it in here there's just no defense the heat's too intense and, oh, how it rises whenever you're near
- Then let's talk process going forward.<eos> - What are you thinking?<eos> Well, now that you know I can hit a scene out of the park,<eos> I think it would be good to go back and take a broader view.<eos> I don't agree.<eos> About a broader view?<eos> No, that she hit the scene out of the park.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Everyone loved the scene.<eos> Well, that's because it was good, but it wasn't right.
That couldn't be further from the truth.<eos> Come on.<eos> Clearly you've been unhappy with me.<eos> You've been auditioning new partners all year.<eos> First it was Peter.<eos> Now it's Scott.<eos> Jimmy, Kyle.<eos> You told me last week that all you want to do is direct.<eos> Look, maybe we're just going in different directions.<eos> Or maybe this partnership only works when it's all about you.
To you, this is just a concert.<eos> You'll move on to other shows.<eos> This is Ronnie's life.<eos> She wants to grow, but she's scared.<eos> Okay.<eos> What should I do?<eos> Just let her sing whatever the hell she wants.<eos> Derek, Derek.<eos> You got to hear this song.<eos> It'll break your heart.
So, wanna see what's on TV?<eos> - That was meant to be a joke.<eos> - I don't have time for jokes.<eos> Sorry!<eos> Didn't realise this was such a busy time for you.<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> This whole island is depending on me to keep it pristine and untouched and you're touching it.<eos> Well, you don't know anything about me either, okay?<eos> And unless I learn to fly, I can't help touching your stupid island.<eos> - If it's so stupid, Why'd you come?
Well, yes.<eos> Are you seriously going to sit down there all night?<eos> Yes. I promise.<eos> I won't budge from this spot. Well, then. I'll have to come to you.<eos> I take it the girl's inside.<eos> And alive?<eos> Yes.<eos> Alexei, I need you to do something creative about that.<eos> I like your house.<eos> It isn't mine, I'm a friend of the family.
I haven't read the newspaper comics regularly for years. And I've only recently started to reacquaint myself with what the comics have to offer now.<eos> But for years I've read and re-read my Calvin and Hobbes books, which always put a smile on my face.<eos> And the strip still holds meaning for so many other readers around the world.<eos> I know, because I've heard from them, and they've sent me their stories.<eos> Many people have tried to track down Bill Watterson over the years.<eos> But I'm not so interested in the man himself, but why his simple comic strip about a boy and his tiger could somehow have such meaning and have had such a personal impact on so many people.<eos> Just as people often find it a challenge to describe the strip itself,<eos> I think anybody would have a hard time distilling the ingredients that made it what it is.<eos> But we can be sure of one thing:<eos> On November 18, 1985, Bill Watterson's creation debuted in just a few dozen newspapers, and it left an enormous imprint on countless readers from across the globe.
And you, you knew the world needed saving, even if it cost you the only father you've ever known.<eos> The fight, that's what matters.<eos> Lovely, but you were asked to go.<eos> Oh, this is not good.<eos> Oh, it's so bad.<eos> Since you won't go, I'll see to it that you make no further progress.<eos> What was that you were saying about knocking out one evil and another one popping up?<eos> Good news is I was right.<eos> This disease is not spreading.<eos> It has spread.
Good news is I was right.<eos> This disease is not spreading.<eos> It has spread.<eos> Those are the words of Dr. Vanessa Calder from the CDC in Atlanta.<eos> The illness, which only a few hours ago was thought to be simple dehydration confined to Europe, has quickly spread to virtually every corner of the globe.<eos> The CDC is classifying the outbreak as a worldwide pandemic, the fastest to have been declared as such in the agency's history.<eos> We'll be covering this crisis around the clock.<eos> Stay with us.<eos> Wait, the legend is here?<eos> You said it was in a collection.
I don't know what to do.<eos> Well... you know, we could go back to Atlanta and stay up there for a while.<eos> You know, there are people... people who know how to help you with what you're going through.<eos> Get away from all the pressures of being here.<eos> All the triggers around you.<eos> The danger here.<eos> What is it, honey?<eos> What's going on, Daniel?<eos> My strange life.<eos> Does it look open?
Oh, God.<eos> The day from hell.<eos> You'll get back.<eos> You just have to give it time, let things play out.<eos> They'll close ranks.<eos> That's how it works.<eos> Those that haven't already.<eos> I'm screwed, Freya.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm just trying to look the damn beast in the eye, see it for what it is.
WOMAN: That you were the one. That you were going to split this family right down the middle.<eos> Candace, let's go.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> He's all yours now.<eos> Hi.<eos> I fell asleep and...<eos> " Daddy?<eos> When did the music stop for you?<eos> Was it before or after she died?<eos> It never stopped, sweetheart.
Swing!<eos> - Let him go.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Play ball.<eos> Come on, Tate.<eos> Swing big!<eos> Read "Moneyball," asshole.<eos> Walks are as good as hits.<eos> Just when you think your day couldn't get any worse, it got worse.
You looked like a little badass in third grade.<eos> And were you afraid to get back in that station wagon?<eos> Nah.<eos> Five years later you took out that same car, without permission from nobody.<eos> Not your parents, not Old Man Law.<eos> Just you and Sally Moran, parked at the point, finger-blasting away!<eos> Didn't even know if you were doing it right!<eos> Where are you going with this?<eos> I'm saying life is that station wagon, okay?<eos> Yeah, sometimes it's going to throw you through the windshield and crack your skull open.

- No, no, no, it's fine.<eos> It's not all flowers.<eos> Really, I like them. I want them.<eos> I actually want them.<eos> Why has Kate got ﬂowers?<eos> She's allergic.<eos> - Only mildly.<eos> Ah, Michaela!<eos> I've come to take my car.<eos> Move yours, it's blocking mine.
We've had nothing but trouble since you talked your way into the Medici court.<eos> Perhaps God is on the count's side in this business.<eos> I don't believe in any God who would side with that pig's bladder.<eos> You blaspheme.<eos> Men like you artistic perverts are turning Florence into Gomorrah.<eos> You're beating a quick path to the everlasting bonfire and dragging us all with you.<eos> I'll send you to the bonfire even sooner.<eos> I know you're a better swordsman than I, da Vinci.<eos> Still... I struck the bone, eh?<eos> Do you really want to blunt the edge of your blade on me when you may need it sharp for Riario?
Your imprisonment affects your mind.<eos> That's perhaps true, but that's cipher.<eos> If my internment is to continue, then there are certain private wishes I need fulfilled.<eos> Minor matters.<eos> Disposition of my business.<eos> That's all.<eos> It's nothing to trouble you, Father.<eos> If Giuliano is yet to select a text, may I suggest the Decameron.<eos> My favorite is the stolen pig story.<eos> It's quite a crowd-pleaser.
don't take him away.<eos> It wasn't a taunt, it was a warning.<eos> Vlad built the device to eviscerate you if you were freed... ..to rip an unstanchable wound.<eos> I should've realized.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Never mind.<eos> I must tell you of the key you seek.<eos> The other key that opens the Vault of Heaven?<eos> Yes, tell me.<eos> It's waiting in Rome, there for your taking.
- He used to whup me.<eos> - For his fear of toupees.<eos> It was a vicious cycle.<eos> This is the original owner of the house,<eos> Bucky Sharavino.<eos> He was a chocolatier.<eos> My boss rented this mansion from Bucky's estate.<eos> Legend has it that Bucky built his own secret chocolate room.<eos> Does legend say where this room is exactly?<eos> Rumor has it it's somewhere near the living room.
It relates to what you were saying earlier:<eos> a judge doesn't deliver justice, he enforces the law.<eos> The biggest scam in modern societies is making us believe that what's legal is fair.<eos> The problem is that the laws and the concept of justice are established by a group of people who are only interested in holding their power.<eos> My point is...<eos> I can crush a butterfly and wring it to death, and that's not illegal.<eos> Now, if the butterfly belongs to some billionaire's collection, I can go to jail.<eos> It's not the act itself what's judged.<eos> The law does not protect us from an aberrant act.<eos> It only intervenes if that aberrant act threatens the will of the powerful.
Let me get changed.<eos> Year '86, Pineiro case.<eos> Aggravated homicide.<eos> Not very well referenced.<eos> The victim was a weapon fanatic.<eos> He had a collection of over 200.<eos> His wife found him in his study with a shot in the head.<eos> The lock hadn't been forced, there were no signs of a struggle, nothing was missing.<eos> The murder weapon was on the floor.<eos> It was one from his collection and it had his prints on it.
Well, good luck to both of you!<eos> Likewise, Mr. Mas.<eos> How did you know we were landing here?<eos> After I spoke to you, I rang a friend in air traffic control.<eos> In the end she told me everything.<eos> This time I wasn't lying.<eos> No, not this time.<eos> This is Alba's phone.<eos> This is your case.<eos> It's all battered.
Yes, but I only touched it for like two seconds.<eos> It was stinking!<eos> Like, it was rancid!<eos> Here, smell this.<eos> I don't know how she play with that!<eos> He had two fingers in my tight little box, mom.<eos> Stop lyin'.<eos> It is...<eos> Baby, there's nothin' tight about her box.<eos> It's fuckin' huge!
The exorcist, the last exorcism, theexorcismof Emilyrose.<eos> Allwhitegirls.<eos> 'Cause there ain't no black parents gonna have no little white girl talkin' like that.<eos> "Bitch, who are you? Who're you cursing' at?<eos> "And turn the fuckin' air down in here!"<eos> Malcolm, Malcolm, just listen for a second.<eos> Yes. When we first met you, there was something attached to you.<eos> Oh, that was a hemorrhoid.<eos> That was...<eos> it's good now. This dark entity has attached itself to him and now it's feeding off of all of you.
No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Athelstan?<eos> He is so weak he cannot eat.<eos> Pray to the gods, please, for him.<eos> Wait, no.<eos> I said no.<eos> No.<eos> Lord of lords, we make this offering to you, hoping you will find it pleasing.
I'll be campaigning in Pennsylvania.<eos> All my events this week will be in counties within the watershed, so I'll be working the media angle.<eos> But if you need me to get on the phone with anybody, reach out to Christina.<eos> She'll work it into my schedule.<eos> I have to say, Frank,<eos> $200 million is going to be a hard sell.<eos> The natural gas lobby's already putting up a big fight.<eos> We need to make this about jobs.<eos> But the drilling industry can offer far more jobs than this bill can.<eos> This bill doesn't threaten those jobs, it just makes sure the drilling is done responsibly.

Our very own congressman, Frank Underwood.<eos> - [Underwood] Good morning.<eos> - [Congregation] Good morning.<eos> Thank you, reverend, and thanks to that choir for that beautiful hymn.<eos> I want to read, this morning, from...<eos> No.<eos> You know what no one wants to talk about.<eos> Hate.<eos> I know all about hate.<eos> It starts in your gut, deep down here, where it stirs and churns.
Previously on Being Human...<eos> No reunions.<eos> No people from her past.<eos> That's the catch.<eos> Sally?<eos> It's Trent.<eos> This is why you can't see anyone from your past.<eos> They'll die.<eos> There was this flu, and if you drink the blood of someone who had it, it wipes out vampires.
- Sally, put it down.<eos> - No.<eos> You keep acting this way, you're gonna end up sick just like Henry.<eos> You don't get it.<eos> There is no good way of doing this.<eos> Josh is screening people.<eos> He's given you names.<eos> Sure.<eos> Then at any second, with any handshake, a door handle, railing or cough, that source goes from safe to unsafe.<eos> This disease, it's everywhere.
Ok, regardless of your help or not...<eos> I'm leaving today, ok?<eos> So... what's it gonna be?<eos> Ok, great.<eos> We don't have a lot of time.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's so disgusting.<eos> I love it!<eos> Are you seeing this?<eos> This grass, it is so... it's so green!
Please. At least tell me where to find her.<eos> Look... even if I knew, I would advise you to just stay away.<eos> And what?<eos> I just wait around for her creepy ass door to show up?<eos> What do you mean "her" door?<eos> I brought 2 people back with me from limbo.<eos> And when they died, they both got the same door.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> I mean, from what I understand, a door is your portal.<eos> If the same door is appearing to several different people, it's not leading to the next world.

That's an unnatural power!<eos> - Then I'm going with you.<eos> - You can't.<eos> Oh, please don't argue with me!<eos> You can't because that door is for spirits:<eos> Nick, Stevie, me in a few hours.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I mean, Donna's door isn't for ghosts moving on.<eos> It's just another spell.<eos> It doesn't appear when you've resolved your issues on Earth.

Okay~<eos> Why, why is Lord Bills coming here?<eos> Why?<eos> Lord Bills, why would you...<eos> Welcome!<eos> The long travel must have been tiring.<eos> Long time no see, Northern-Kai.<eos> Your star is very small.<eos> I apologise, it's quite the boring and mundane star.<eos> You made it smaller by destryoing it, Lord Bills.
Was your mum deep on puddings?<eos> She was a great woman.<eos> What's this?<eos> Oh, it arrived today - for you.<eos> "My dearest Clara...<eos> "The Doctor entrusted me with your contact details,<eos> "in the event of an emergency, and I fear one has now arisen.<eos> "Assuming this letter will have reached you, as planned,<eos> "on April 10th 2013, please find and light the enclosed candle.<eos> "It will release a soporific which will induce a trance state,
Yeah, should probably have mentioned that - never the right time.<eos> But I met her!<eos> Long story.<eos> But her grave can't be here.<eos> Doctor!<eos> This man must fall as all men must The fate of all is always dust.<eos> If it's not my gravestone, then what is it?<eos> What do you think the gravestone really is?<eos> The gravestone?<eos> Maybe it's a false grave!
Mako, I missed you so much.<eos> Oh, yeah, did I forget to tell you?<eos> Korra's back.<eos> Korra, hey, I missed you too.<eos> So you're not still mad at me?<eos> Why would I be mad?<eos> We had that fight before you left, remember?<eos> No, not really.<eos> I got attacked by a dark spirit, and I lost my memory for a little while.<eos> Maybe it hasn't all come back yet.
The Avatar has gone missing.<eos> After president Raiko refused Korra's request to aid the South in the war of the water tribes, she headed to the fire nation, seeking a new ally against Unalaq.<eos> But unbeknownst to her friends, a dark spirit attacked Korra and dragged her into the ocean.<eos> She has washed up on a desolate island with no memory of who she is.<eos> We found the Avatar washed up onshore, but she doesn't remember anything.<eos> Raava.<eos> Raava.<eos> Raava.<eos> A dark energy has infected her.<eos> We must purge it before it destroys her Avatar spirit.
Get 'em off!<eos> Ahh!<eos> Well, looks like you're all out of tricks, Wan.<eos> I really hate humans!<eos> No, no.<eos> I don't know what he's screaming about.<eos> He's better-looking now.<eos> I feel great.<eos> What's in this water?<eos> It has special healing properties.
I know.<eos> I tried to fight it, but she really grew on me.<eos> The spirit world is very mysterious, but so is love.<eos> Help yourself to some tea and cakes.<eos> They are spirit cakes, so you won't gain any weight.<eos> Of course, you won't lose any, either.<eos> This part of the spirit world isn't so scary.<eos> My teapot.<eos> That's right.<eos> It was yours long, long ago.
Your Rose...<eos> She's not my Rose.<eos> She's not mine... ..as you well know.<eos> According to Mrs Reid, Rose did not return to the shelter last night.<eos> Then, she returns to type.<eos> That was my response also until Mrs Reid told me the shelter had been broke into.<eos> Nothing taken but the girl's personals.<eos> What use our work, Bennet... ..if we cannot care for those we love?<eos> You said the wastepaper had been cleared? Uh-huh.<eos> You noticed it full.
I have always known it.<eos> I have known she was out there, somewhere.<eos> But this, this secret dream that now takes life...<eos> It is not for you to share with me.<eos> Your daughter had a mother.<eos> A mother who would have me call her dead and gone...<eos> No, Edmund, no!<eos> I cannot be the sounding board for your guilt.<eos> You seek forgiveness?<eos> An ally in the hope that your life might return to what it once was?
You must take the land promised to Abraham.<eos> Moses has led the Israelites to the edge of the promised land.<eos> Under Joshua, they must conquer it.<eos> Lord.<eos> I was with Moses when he handed down these commandments.<eos> I was witness to the covenant, the promise of a holy nation.<eos> Help me to forge that nation, to lead your people to inherit their land.<eos> Joshua!<eos> The Lord brought us out from Egypt, he promised us this land.<eos> And soon... it will be ours!
He told me to build a boat.<eos> God has spoken to me.<eos> He will lead us to a new home.<eos> He has promised descendents as numerous as the stars.<eos> Aah!<eos> - Who are you? - My name is Moses.<eos> God has sent me to set you free.<eos> The Lord brought us out from Egypt.<eos> He promised us this land!<eos> Soon it will be ours!
You dare to come between me and my mother?<eos> A bridge in my mother's name will be made in Jhumli.<eos> The foundation stone shall be laid tomorrow.<eos> Hail, Lord Sri Ram!<eos> No no... Even they deserve some credit.<eos> Once the bridge is made, the children will be able to attend school.<eos> It'll be easy.<eos> You'll really be sorry the day I exact revenge for that slap.<eos> And this slap won't hurt your body.<eos> It'll break your soul.
I wanna, you know, I wanna see what's outside.<eos> I got some news for you, baby.<eos> You're gonna gain the weight back.<eos> Then there's not gonna be any jaspar, then you're gonna be alone.<eos> You're gonna gain the weight back.<eos> What is that... Why do you gotta say that?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You're going to, that's what happens.<eos> Nature abhors a vacuum.<eos> - It wants to fill up...

I gave you some well-needed home truths.<eos> You gave me insolence and ingratitude.<eos> OK, that's it.<eos> City.<eos> No, I'm not going!<eos> You need a doctor who won't upset you simply by being there.<eos> I'll get you another sedative and arrange a transfer.<eos> Jack, after all I've done for you.<eos> Just stop!<eos> If I took your blood pressure now it'd be way up again.
Or should I call you...<eos> Pamela?<eos> I got to hand it to you.<eos> I did not see that coming.<eos> But... It makes it a hell of a lot more interesting.<eos> What do you want, John Ross?<eos> I don't have to play weak anymore.<eos> And trust me.<eos> You don't want me setting my target on your back.<eos> I am just fine with you keeping that target right where it's at.
He's already squirreled away in an air vent somewhere with his fucking statistics.<eos> Where?<eos> Where's his office?<eos> You know that portrait with the guy who looks like a fat Wolverine?<eos> - Oh, yeah. - It's just one door on the left from there.<eos> - But wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> - What?<eos> You know what's gonna happen to me tomorrow?<eos> No.<eos> My good friend POTUS, my Gamma Chi brother, is gonna summon me to his office and he's gonna show me a sword and he's gonna tell me to take the sword and slide it down my throat until it comes out my ass.
You're actually pleased about this?<eos> Why?<eos> Because well, we lost the House, that's bad, obviously, but now this gets me off your case and that's okay?<eos> Couldn't have put that better myself, sir.<eos> Are you eating my pizza?<eos> No, sir, you...<eos> Because you said that...<eos> No, I said don't wave it in my face.<eos> - I didn't say eat it.<eos> - It's still good.
Hey, Sven!<eos> He found us.<eos> Who's my cute little reindeer?<eos> Don't talk to him like that.<eos> You're tickling me.<eos> Here.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Thank you.<eos> How's your head?<eos> It's fine.
You screwed me over.<eos> You screwed my daughter.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> I don't like him one bit.<eos> Which is partially a joke.<eos> Really rubbed me the wrong way.<eos> But nonetheless, I'm going to introduce him. Please welcome<eos> Gustav Warner, everybody.<eos> Thank you. Thank you.<eos> Tonight, one voice transcends the very generation it represents.
Six.<eos> And have you ever once thought of quitting, leaving town, finding a safer job?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> - We all have our stories, and we've endured a lot:<eos> Raiders, epidemics, floods.<eos> We're still standing, just like that big-ass arch up there.<eos> We live in a great place, a town where human and votan races live together as equals.<eos> We strive for the best, but sometimes we fall short.<eos> Sometimes we forget ourselves, and occasionally, this new world rears up and kicks us in the teeth, but we stay.<eos> We fight because this town is worth fighting for, and if necessary, it's worth dying for.
Jeez, Chavo, you look like a giant baby on film.<eos> Make sure that little red light's blinking.<eos> Thank you for that amazing advice.<eos> Thank you for being so sarcastic.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Ready?<eos> I am currently standing less than 200 meters from where Chavo here cowered like a bitch in a bush, but somehow managed to get a picture of this thing's right calf and buttock before it disappeared into the bush.
- Come on.<eos> - Oh.<eos> That's what you get for calling me Los Lobos.<eos> Dude, this is a total bonus.<eos> - Aah!<eos> - What can I do to help?<eos> - Stay back, Chavo!<eos> - I was hoping you'd say that.<eos> Lassie, grab the branch!<eos> It's right in front of you.
Was that...<eos> a spinning back fist?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - My God, I love you.<eos> - [Sighs, moans]<eos> I knew you'd come.<eos> I just knew it.<eos> How'd you know I was here?<eos> Spencer-- he had a vision.<eos> I got to say it was a pretty spectacular one.
- this movie writes itself.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I really don't have time for this.<eos> Henry, it was lovely to see you again.<eos> - You too.<eos> - Don't go far.<eos> All right, what the hell are you doing here?<eos> Come on, Shawn, that theory of yours<eos> - is a little half-baked.<eos> - Of course it is.
Let's bounce, Gus.<eos> Gus, come on.<eos> Gus, get up, get up.<eos> Gus? I'm a little parched, but I feel great.<eos> That's because you just slept for 20 minutes.<eos> - Oh, hey. Hi, I'm Laura.<eos> I--I, um, uh... um. - I didn't know you did Bikram. - Uh, yeah.<eos> A variation where you wear all your clothes and your shoes.<eos> That's why your skin's so clean.<eos> It is, isn't it?
Loicfromtheuniversity,the departmentscholarships.<eos> It'saboutstayinginTokyo.<eos> Ah , Tokyo.<eos> And what about Tokyo ?<eos> awardedherascholarship.<eos> Halo<eos> - But ... you do not know?<eos> -Aboutwhat?<eos> O. .. her mother.<eos> It has ovarian cancer .
Harder.<eos> Harder.<eos> Harder.<eos> You broke my tooth, but if you love me, it doesn't matter.<eos> Of course it matters.<eos> To the dentist!<eos> Get on, you lazy bastard!<eos> To the rubbish dump!<eos> Dynamite has no heart,<eos> It strokes us apart.
The colonel can ask at any time after his best friend.<eos> He's coming tomorrow.<eos> As for me, the time has come to leave.<eos> What?<eos> Here is your grave, Don Aquiles.<eos> Take off your clothes and put on mine.<eos> Never take this hat off, friend.<eos> That way Bucephalus will never know I've gone.<eos> For sure he'll love you as much as me.<eos> I'm giving up my soul, it wants to return home.

Keep it all and go away.<eos> Nothing!<eos> Nothing!<eos> Mama!<eos> Mama!<eos> What's the matter, Alejandrito?<eos> Being in a cradle of cement, swaddled in a gigantic shadow, bound to my empty existence.<eos> Trapped in this island of flesh, searching for myself in memories, and meeting no one.<eos> The darkness is swallowing everything.<eos> It's going to devour us.
Trapped in this island of flesh, searching for myself in memories, and meeting no one.<eos> The darkness is swallowing everything.<eos> It's going to devour us.<eos> Alejandrito, do I love you?<eos> Yes, Mama.<eos> How much?<eos> From the sky to the earth.<eos> This is not my love, it comes from God, I am merely the sender.<eos> As God creates all, so we all radiate His love.<eos> My son, the darkness loves you as much as I do, for it is God's shadow.
Put a sock in it and keep moving, Pope.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> What are you gaping at?<eos> Move your asses.<eos> I want you to wash this down for me.<eos> Head injury.<eos> Hey.<eos> How's Lars?<eos> Hey. The bite of the harness kid introduced an extremely aggressive bacteria into his system.<eos> It's releasing toxins that are destroying his internal organs.
When was that?<eos> What, three or four months?<eos> Yeah, more or less.<eos> How's Harriet?<eos> Is she OK?<eos> She's doing fine.<eos> She's great, yeah.<eos> Can you get to this door?<eos> It's locked.<eos> And even if it wasn't...
I'd like to help you find the guy who got away.<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> Two sticks of butter?<eos> Paula Deen, when will you learn?<eos> Molly, um, that's my friend Tyler.<eos> Oh, Milo, you come here, too?<eos> Wow.<eos> I bet you can see this house from space.<eos> - Oh, is it big?
We'd do it, but my allergies are pretty brutal.<eos> - Tyler?<eos> - Oh, God, I want to say yes, but our place doesn't allow dogs.<eos> - Milo?<eos> - I live with her.<eos> - Gibbs?<eos> - No can do.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - No want to do.<eos> Look, I like my life the way it is.
We're almost a month into the strike, and we've got millions of kids stuck home from school.<eos> Do you blame the White House or Congress?<eos> I personally have very little sympathy for the teachers.<eos> We're over three weeks into this strike.<eos> It's costing the country billions of dollars, and instead of offering solutions...
Good night.<eos> Front door. Yes, sir.<eos> Your weapon.<eos> Your badge, too.<eos> Am I suspended, sir?<eos> You had a suspect on foot, and you fire your gun? Sir, I realize that...<eos> Do you know how this reflects on me?<eos> Not only do you abandon your post for coffee. You could've killed a bystander.<eos> That slug was found on somebody's front stoop.<eos> What if it went in their house?
I want it over.<eos> As soon as possible.<eos> Gut the bill, Frank.<eos> Do whatever's necessary to end this.<eos> Mr. President, if we give in now, the public won't credit you with a victory. Not even a hollow one.<eos> They'll chalk it up as a colossal defeat.<eos> Well, that's on you, Frank.<eos> You let this situation devolve to where it is.<eos> I've already been blamed for the largest teachers' strike in U.S. history.<eos> I won't be held accountable for it dragging on months and months.
The bigger that number gets, the more it frightens me, because I know all it takes is one drink to go back to zero.<eos> Most people see fear as a weakness.<eos> It can be.<eos> Sometimes for my job, I have to put fear in other people.<eos> I know that's not right.<eos> But if I'm honest, like the fourth step asks us to be, I have to be ruthless, because failure is not an option.<eos> The same goes for my sobriety.<eos> I have to be ruthless with myself.<eos> I have to use my fear.<eos> It makes me stronger.
- But if it backfires, Frank...<eos> - I'll guide Peter every step along the way.<eos> We will not disappoint you, Mr. President.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Linda.<eos> I didn't plan on telling him so much so soon, but if I didn't, Linda would've swayed him.<eos> There's no better way to overpower a trickle of doubt than with a flood of naked truth.<eos> This is why the education bill was so important.<eos> It bought me influence precisely when I needed it most.
I'm sorry.<eos> You ain't sorry, you're scared.<eos> You have every right to be.<eos> God shaped all of us the way we are.<eos> All of us.<eos> You bastard.<eos> You fuck with my brother, I'll fuck with you.<eos> You wanna look at that picture?<eos> Come on now, I know you do.<eos> It's here somewhere.
Will all this make any difference?<eos> I have to believe it will.<eos> Halbach told me you always arrived first.<eos> So we have a few moments before the others get here.<eos> I-I can't do it!<eos> What you're asking, it is too dangerous.<eos> If there was more money, would you find it less dangerous?<eos> - You must understand...<eos> - I understand greed. - You must understand...<eos> - It makes things very simple between us.
- There's nothing here.<eos> - Of course there is, Nick.<eos> Now, listen to me, when you find it, bring it with you.<eos> Now... the clue to round five will be waiting for you in the hotel parking lot in the car parked right next to Tommy boy's.<eos> Tick, tick, tick.<eos> Round five's about to start.<eos> Damn it.<eos> What am I supposed to be looking for?<eos> What am I bringing to the parking lot?<eos> Hey, you know, Nick, isn't it funny how sometimes we can't see the very thing that will help us, even though it's staring us right in the face?
Holy mackerel, man.<eos> I'll tell you. They're spooky, marsupials.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh, boy. Oh, boy.<eos> Now's a good time to set some ground rules about coming and going.<eos> Oh, you know what?<eos> That reminds me.<eos> Has somebody removed a box of vintage pornography?<eos> I had been looking after it, you see.<eos> And then I just came in, it just wasn't there no more.

You might want some Bactine...<eos> Thank you!<eos> I put some fucking Bactine on it!<eos> - Whoa, Jack.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> It's just that this house has had a strange effect on my wife, and I think she might be possessed by a demon, so I'm a little stressed out.<eos> This is an evil house, so we're doin' this little gris-gris ceremony.<eos> And not a day too soon neither.<eos> It's actually a Haitian ceremony.<eos> It cleans the space of bad spirits.
Uh-huh. What did I tell you?<eos> When you said "pizza salad" I was kind of sceptical, F'resnel.<eos> I thought you were gonna throw pizza slices in a bowl of salad.<eos> That's very much what I did do.<eos> Precisely, in fact. That's why we call it pizza salad.<eos> Know what I'm sayin'?<eos> You just take a Domino's pizza, you toss it in a bowl with some salad, also from Domino's.<eos> Well, I think this is a perfect time to bring up some of the weird stuff that's been going on in the house.<eos> Namely Marjorie's 'smudge' ceremony.<eos> Think it may have awoken something really big.
He gets in his head and he makes him unmanly and he overcompensates for a week or two.<eos> Do we have to write down all this stuff?<eos> Yes! - So how is it, the town you're in?<eos> - The town I'm in...<eos> Hmm... Medical opinion?<eos> Inbreeding.<eos> - I'm not... I'm not writin' that down. - And what about the house?<eos> The house?<eos> Yeah, it's, uh...<eos> It's hideous.
You know, and out here, I-I still didn't believe it, that I was alive.<eos> It-it was like a-<eos> - I thought it was like a dead man's dream, you know?<eos> You'll never die now, Daniel.<eos> Will you ever die, Tawney?<eos> No.<eos> I'm so glad.<eos> Hey, don't be ashamed.<eos> God is releasing your pain.<eos> Where does it go?
Very well.<eos> We must all pull together today.<eos> Kitty!<eos> Do I have to call you Miss Hawkins now?<eos> I think it'd be best, don't you?<eos> His pupils are dilating in response to the light, which is a good sign.<eos> And it's encouraging that he's making sound.<eos> But not sense?<eos> Sense, we must hope, will come later.<eos> Doctor, his hand, it moved.
Thanks, Victor.<eos> But you need to wise up.<eos> Your sister's out of a job, feeling cut up.<eos> She's ain't out of a job no more!<eos> She found something?<eos> She's back here, isn't she?<eos> She's back at Selfridges.<eos> I want to put a whole family in it.<eos> Father, mother, children.<eos> And the motor will be at an angle, so it is almost flying.
Tell him there's no phone call.<eos> I'm authorising you to tell him the truth.<eos> Come on, tell him he's delusional.<eos> It's true, Qohen. Your phone call's a delusion.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> I was programmed to leave your peculiar pathology untreated.<eos> - All right. Thanks, babes. See you.<eos> - But I didn't...<eos> The truth ain't pretty, Q.<eos> But like my old man says, it'll set you free.
What ever happened to her?<eos> We married her, she eventually divorced us... and we never saw her again.<eos> Thanks for that happy, hopeful little parable.<eos> I can hardly wait for my own first divorce.<eos> - Yeah, more, more. That's it, yeah.<eos> - I don't know any girls my age.<eos> Seems like getting old would be pretty boring.<eos> Old people, they just... They do the same thing day after day after day.<eos> Like listening to the same song over and over and over.<eos> Yeah, maybe it's a good song. Maybe.
Undefeated!<eos> You still haven't beaten me yet.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> - Eh.<eos> - Eh.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - You're going to break this car!<eos> - It'll be all right.<eos> - It's already falling apart.
Oh, that's great news.<eos> I worked it out with his mom, her lawyers.<eos> Oh, he'll be so much happier when he's with us full-time.<eos> Happy birthday, Danny.<eos> Kids at school say we're really rich and that you give money to charity. Sure I do.<eos> You gotta remember as you go through life to share what you earn with the less fortunate.<eos> Not everyone is as lucky as we are.<eos> - Domingo? - Yes, ma'am.<eos> - Another bottle of the Margaux. - Sure.<eos> - It would look perfect.
But if I may say you may have doused yourself a little over-abundantly with it.<eos> God, I'm always nervous it will wear off.<eos> He's taking me to his favorite jeweler.<eos> You think Al is a step up from Chili?<eos> Anybody is a step up from Chili.<eos> He's such a gentleman.<eos> Well, then he's definitely a step up.<eos> But in bed, he's no gentleman.<eos> Wait till he takes a whiff of my new fragrance.<eos> It's French.
Six copies.<eos> We'll take them all, all three.<eos> Why do we seem insane?<eos> Come on, poseur.<eos> - Ok ?<eos> H ?<eos> How are you?<eos> What does the word 'arbitrary'?<eos> That means either a decision for reasons that do not really matter or by someone who has the right did not have to make them.<eos> The decision was arbitrary. It does not matter and you had no right to make them.
Maybe that's fucked up, but at least it's honest.<eos> It's not wishful thinking.<eos> I went snorkeling yesterday.<eos> I wanted to find the turtle you told me about.<eos> There was no turtle, just a bunch of garbage at the bottom of the ocean.<eos> One of the locals told me the bay here has been polluted by all the boats.<eos> I got to hit it.<eos> All the turtles have gone or died.<eos> ♪<eos> Anyway, your turtle, if it ever existed, is gone.
Is this the milf?<eos> Her name is Sonja.<eos> What? I'm single.<eos> I'm just kind of working on the lingo.<eos> - What do you got?<eos> - Okay. Here was the X-ray that we took this morning, and there was an entrance wound right there on the thigh.<eos> So where's the bullet?<eos> And...<eos> - In her abdomen?<eos> - Mm-hmm. It moved?
And...<eos> - In her abdomen?<eos> - Mm-hmm. It moved?<eos> You ever seen anything like it?<eos> No. I mean, I've seen a lot of grody, messed-up trauma, but usually a bullet will kind of rattle around in there, and make some wreckage, you know?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Femoral vein.<eos> What?<eos> The patient got shot, and the bullet got sucked into the femoral vein.<eos> So it's migrating through the venous system?
No. I mean, I've seen a lot of grody, messed-up trauma, but usually a bullet will kind of rattle around in there, and make some wreckage, you know?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Femoral vein.<eos> What?<eos> The patient got shot, and the bullet got sucked into the femoral vein.<eos> So it's migrating through the venous system?<eos> Tumbling through the veins like a pebble in a river.<eos> What?<eos> Just creating a visual.<eos> Well, at least you know where it's going.
Yeah?<eos> Push naloxone. Page me if anything changes.<eos> There's the old Charlie.<eos> That's... my heart.<eos> Which is actually a pretty safe place for a bullet, if you can believe it.<eos> Really?<eos> 'cause I don't actually be-believe that.<eos> You're asymptomatic, which is great.<eos> But the problem is, that right ventricle is opening and closing, pumping blood every second.<eos> And that bullet is gonna bounce on you, and when it does, it's gonna head right for your pulmonary artery.
Me.<eos> Strange brunette.<eos> Strange brunette again.<eos> - Who is she?<eos> - I don't know,<eos> - but I'm gonna find out.<eos> - She's very pretty.<eos> Yeah, for now.<eos> Look at this electric bill.<eos> It is so high.
- Thank you.<eos> - Wait...<eos> Open the door!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Tired.<eos> Comes with age.<eos> You...<eos> You have my key.<eos> Key? Oh.<eos> It's in the pocket.
And going out to dinner's, like, just part of who I am.<eos> That's so-- that's a great part.<eos> That's great.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, Ray.<eos> Skip it.<eos> - Oh, hey, Maggie.<eos> - Hey.<eos> So, listen, on a scale of one to 10, how good do you think my voice actually is?<eos> I already told you it's good, okay?<eos> It's good.

Just go to sleep.<eos> Go to sleep, now.<eos> Hello, Lisa.<eos> You just won't let go of Olivia, will you?<eos> Such a plucky girl.<eos> You know, you were the same way when you were alive.<eos> Trying to save your family from me, trying to fight the tide.<eos> And yet here we are, the two of us, and it ends the same.<eos> History doesn't repeat itself.<eos> It rhymes.
Oh, God. Yeah.<eos> There's something... I mean, if I... if I were gonna see you again... I'd want you to be a little...<eos> What?<eos> I don't want to hurt your feelings. Tell me.<eos> But just maybe...<eos> Stronger, maybe?<eos> Do you know what the KGB is? Um...<eos> I've heard of them. Well...<eos> Well, this weekend, I am giving $100,000 cash to a KGB defector who's coming to town to...<eos> The Reagan administration revealed today that after a month-long review, it will honor the agreement with Iran that led to the release of the 52 American hostages.
Oh, good, it happens so often you've got a term for it.<eos> I'm at the parkade at 38th and Dogwood.<eos> We're on our way.<eos> Hey, do you have any idea what we're dealing with?<eos> Something big and pissed off.<eos> So?<eos> He says big and pissed off.<eos> Well, that really narrows it down.<eos> According to this, we haven't had an anomaly in the last 72 hours.<eos> Maybe it opened in a dead zone.
I did hear you.<eos> In fact, as you know, I was on the scene, but I would like to point out that I wasn't in charge of the operation to recapture the terror bird...<eos> Um, specimen.<eos> You put Major Douglas in charge, so I'm not really sure what the handcuffs are for.<eos> I am acutely aware that you were on the scene, lieutenant.<eos> And instead of assisting in that operation, you shot major Douglas with a tranquilizer dart.<eos> A superior officer.<eos> And I think that that's just the tip of your iceberg, Leeds.<eos> You see, I think that you've been keeping secrets from me.<eos> Why would Leeds give you this key card without telling you what it was for?
What a mess.<eos> This terminal belongs to Leeds.<eos> That's why there's a hole in the firewall.<eos> The guy's an idiot with computers.<eos> So, what are we supposed to do with all that?<eos> Download it.<eos> You were authorized to support Evan Cross' efforts, not to put Project Magnet at his disposal.<eos> I've always felt that my position gives me the latitude to explore that gray area, sir...<eos> The military doesn't give latitude, Leeds.<eos> It gives orders, something that you have a history of disobeying.
Grab it.<eos> Ready?<eos> Yeah.<eos> As per your report,<eos> Mr. Cross and his team dragged the creature through the forest to the anomaly.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> It was an ornitholestes.<eos> They'd tranquilized it.<eos> Right, after which Mr. Cross asked you to have your men guard the anomaly.<eos> To make sure no one went in or out until it closed, yes, sir.
What, are you fuckin' kidding me?<eos> They were career criminals.<eos> They're murderers.<eos> That's what you get for making news during an election year.<eos> Politicians, they love their hearings.<eos> But me-<eos> - I'm like you.<eos> - See, I like results.<eos> - I really do have to go.<eos> I thought we might combine our resources and try to figure out what happened to that evidence against Proctor, how it found its way out of a locked room,
But he has definitely won your heart.<eos> No.<eos> He'll have to win the bet too.<eos> You're still adamant.<eos> If he loses, won't you get them married?<eos> He won't lose.<eos> He put his life at stake for my sister's toy.<eos> My mom will never forgive me if he loses.<eos> I saw his pile in the morning.<eos> It seemed a bit less.
The... the men, they... they were... they were Guinea pigs to perfect implanting the bomb.<eos> Does anyone else know?<eos> No. No, it... it... it didn't turn up on the X-rays.<eos> Th-that's the point, isn't it?<eos> You're gonna remove the device from the body.<eos> I'm sending a signal to deactivate it now.<eos> (Beeps)<eos> Now you're gonna bring it to me.<eos> Please, my daughter... my daughter... she has an insulin pump.<eos> It needs to be refilled in a couple of hours.
- You're dead!<eos> - No no no.<eos> Nobody's dying here.<eos> - Fucking cunts!<eos> - Language! That's unacceptable.<eos> Be adults here!<eos> Do you even have any instruments?<eos> - Aren't there any here?<eos> - You're not using ours!<eos> We used to have a guitar, but it broke.
But I did get lucky that particular time.<eos> Turned out there were three fill-in roles and I got one of them.<eos> My friend, Ben, also received a role.<eos> So, to exploring other options.<eos> Yep.<eos> Pact or no pact, you know I'm still shipping Ben to Tara.<eos> I'm still waiting for you.<eos> The Prix de Fonteyn champion received the third fill-in role.<eos> But we all could have predicted that.<eos> The most confronting thing about third year is it forced us to dig deeper, discover parts of ourselves we didn't know existed, didn't want to.
TONI FAGGOT<eos> - I remembered this place bigger.<eos> - You're the one who's grown.<eos> But I'm glad you think it's small.<eos> You'll have to clean the garden, shed and swimming pool every day.<eos> The bedroom is upstairs, remember?<eos> - Where's the TV?<eos> - There isn't one.<eos> There used to be.<eos> It broke a couple years ago and I threw it out.
He stole our goods.<eos> You're so short...and you look to take a big leap.<eos> Short sizes often achieve big feats.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I was talking about this mosquito?<eos> You stole our consignment and now you're acting smart with us.<eos> I didn't steal it.<eos> I saved it from Parmar.<eos> Your stuff is safe.<eos> It's behind your house.
It feels like a last supper.<eos> You're not the only psychiatrist accused by a patient of making them kill.<eos> Poke around a psychopath's mind, bound to get poked back.<eos> What would you do in my position?<eos> Deny everything.<eos> I thought psychic driving would have been more effective in breaking down his personality.<eos> Psychic driving fails because its methods are too obvious.<eos> You were trying too hard, Frederick.<eos> If force is used, the subject will only surrender temporarily.<eos> Once a patient is exposed to the method of manipulation, it becomes much less effective.
I'll take care of them until then.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We have to do some tests.<eos> They'll be the standard psychopathology tests.<eos> I suppose you're gonna ask me to draw a clock while you're at it.<eos> Did Hannibal ask you to draw a clock?<eos> Said it was an exercise... to ground me in the present moment.<eos> A handle to help me hold on to reality.<eos> Was the clock normal?<eos> Would I be here if it wasn't?
It's graphite.<eos> See if that helps with the recoil.<eos> That was better.<eos> You come all the way down here to teach me how to shoot?<eos> No.<eos> Jack sent me down here to find out what you know about gardening.<eos> So, Lecter gave you the all-clear.<eos> Therapy might work on you after all.<eos> Therapy is an acquired taste which I have yet to acquire.<eos> But, uh, it served your purpose.
Even with the usual growth spurts between eleven and twelve he'd be four and a half feet, eighty pounds tops.<eos> God's gift to trace analysts.<eos> Greasy fingerprints all over these things.<eos> No matches but they're gorgeous.<eos> Isolated seven pairs of shoe prints.<eos> Filtered out the Turner's including Jessie's, so we're down to three unsubs, sneakers are sizes seven three and a half, and a boy's eleven.<eos> The lost boy.<eos> I think I found one of them.<eos> Most of the time in sexual assaults, the bite mark has a livid spot at the center, a "suck bruise."<eos> In some cases it does not.
Dr. Bloom just called me about you,<eos> Mr. Graham... or should I call you Dr. Graham?<eos> - I'm not a doctor.<eos> - You're not FBI either.<eos> That's a temporary identification<eos> Mr. Graham teaches at the academy.<eos> Ah, a teacher.<eos> Please, gentlemen, take a seat.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Dr. Chilton, we're going to need to see the crime scene while it's still relatively undisturbed.
Where's Will Graham?<eos> Will.<eos> There you are.<eos> And Dr. Lecter.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> We have a lead.<eos> Would you care to, uh, help us catch the Ripper?<eos> How could I refuse?<eos> That ambulance isn't in rotation.<eos> It hasn't even been out of the shed.
What do they have in common?<eos> Gas.<eos> They all use gas.<eos> Gas, so the drug squad's watching the gas.<eos> They're watching the gas.<eos> It's a magic trick.<eos> Drug squad's watching right here.<eos> - The meth's over here.<eos> - So where's the meth?<eos> It never came off the truck.
New home?<eos> Yeah, the old guard dealt with these Faes wrong.<eos> Relocating them is the right thing to do... and not just because we need to put in that new subway line.<eos> Relocating?<eos> Right.<eos> Thanks, bro.<eos> Did it just get real cold down here?<eos> I'm getting a bad feeling about this ... [music]<eos> The music...<eos> it's so pretty... like a lullaby...
Uh, off topic.<eos> Go on.<eos> But in the end it was JR who totally lost his grip.<eos> I guess he made some pretty wild accusations about her.<eos> Like what?<eos> Dad wouldn't say.<eos> Must have been some serious crazy-person stuff.<eos> There was a suicide letter too.<eos> They found it the next day.<eos> Do you have any idea what it might have said?
Is that Olivia?<eos> No.<eos> In the end, it was JR who totally lost his grip.<eos> I guess he made some pretty wild accusations about her.<eos> Like what?<eos> Dad wouldn't say.<eos> Must have been some serious crazy person stuff.<eos> There was a suicide letter too.<eos> They found it the next day.<eos> Do you have any idea what it might have said?
Are you sure that I'm the cushion?<eos> Yes. You're the cushion.<eos> Well, you know, I've never done it before, but I definitely am up for it.<eos> You are the cushion.<eos> This fucking lawn.<eos> It uses, like, 800 gallons of water.<eos> Why haven't you just let it get brown and die?<eos> You know I want to, don't you?<eos> But she won't fucking let me.<eos> It's a living thing. It grows, it lives.
No. We're not, are we?<eos> Frank!<eos> Frank, come meet Hannah.<eos> This is my baby.<eos> - Hey. Nice to meet you. I'm Hannah.<eos> I really like the way you fold down your turtleneck.<eos> Really? This was a total accident that happened.<eos> This towel is so small and thin.<eos> It's like it's for a Borrower. I can't take a shower with this.<eos> I think it's really dirty, too.
That's a toilet.<eos> He has a toilet in the living room?<eos> Mm-hmm. I prefer to see it as a really artsy chair.<eos> So can you toss some pillows, drape some fabric, home this place up a little bit?<eos> Josslyn, sweetie,<eos> I wouldn't make a dent.<eos> I mean, that is more than a flannel throw away from being inhabitable.<eos> Mm. You're right.<eos> You're right. Screw it.<eos> I'm not gonna try to make this house something it's not.

And 5 more girls were murdered.<eos> ♪ Let me hate for you ♪<eos> ♪ and hate for me ♪<eos> I got your message.<eos> What is it?<eos> I got an e-mail.<eos> If you catch the sun just right, the bug catches fire.<eos> Why do you want to kill a bug?<eos> Because we can.<eos> See, if you kill the bug, then it dies, and your life means a little more.

- Thank you, Daniel...<eos> We received a gift from Martin Torkington.<eos> We did?<eos> To commemorate the eighth anniversary of our Republic.<eos> Cologne water.<eos> Even our enemies are resigned to our existence.<eos> Don't believe it.<eos> May I take your sword, General?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Have it ready for tomorrow, Clarita.
I dreamed about you again last night.<eos> I guess I dream about you every night and most days too.<eos> I hold your face in my mind.<eos> I put your voice together in my head.<eos> I think about your hair getting longer.<eos> I think about your belly getting bigger.<eos> I hear people talk about regret', but I haven't got any.<eos> I don't think poorly on the things that I've done.<eos> We did what we did, and that is who we are.<eos> They're gonna cross out this sentence before you get to read it, but I know you know what it says.
Go on, Bob.<eos> I got to unlock my door.<eos> Get out of here before someone sees you. Go find yourself someplace safe.<eos> Where are the keys?<eos> The keys?<eos> I'm gonna give her trouble?<eos> I'm gonna give her trouble?<eos> He thinks he can buy her a house?<eos> No, sir. I don't think that's how it works.<eos> Ruth will walk away from that house like it was on fire.
In the future, I'm a very old man.<eos> And I'm standing in a door.<eos> We're in a house.<eos> It's our house, somewhere far away from here, where everything is green and the sun is almost set.<eos> And where we're standing, the way I see it, we're waving to somebody.<eos> And maybe that somebody is you, come to see us after a long time gone.<eos> If it is you. We are very happy to see you.<eos> Tell me more about that house.<eos> I'm not talking to you.<eos> It's big, maybe a farm.

Well.<eos> - But really, that's great news.<eos> - Good, I'm glad you're glad.<eos> I mean, he's a good kid.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Let's hope for the best.<eos> - That was tiring, huh?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - But I love the colour.<eos> - Nice, isn't it?
Well, let's keep it that way before Russo adds to the body count.<eos> Okay, let me get this straight.<eos> Your dad is representing the father of our victim, one of the most notorious gangsters of the past decade, and this isn't information you think I need to know?<eos> I wanted to tell you. I tried.<eos> I couldn't find the right moment.<eos> Well, there wasn't a wrong moment.<eos> You have to understand.<eos> My father sets criminals free for a living.<eos> Those are the guys that we risk our lives to catch.<eos> If the other cops find out, my career is over before it starts.
Who are you possibly protecting here?<eos> Ted?<eos> That is your father you are talking about.<eos> God, okay.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Dad, what are you doing?<eos> I thought we were meeting at the club.<eos> Dropped my hospital key card somewhere.<eos> I...<eos> Do you guys know where it is?
No feelings.<eos> It's either me or an ambulance.<eos> I'm not kidding.<eos> No feelings...<eos> Hale!<eos> I just need two seconds of your time.<eos> Oh!<eos> Sick outfit.<eos> Very Gaga-esque.<eos> Ok, I got this Australian wool and it is on sale,
You have the number? I do.<eos> The number, sir?<eos> Mr Ressler will give it to you.<eos> This your office, Mr Claxton?<eos> It is, sir. Yes, sir.<eos> You install these cabinets yourself?<eos> If memory serves, sir.<eos> Reid, every man likes a good cabinet, but is this quite the time?<eos> Did you notice the dimensions of this room from without, when we entered?<eos> It is a rectangle, Mr Ressler.
What kind of ashes?<eos> Excuse me, am I speaking to Australia Post, Yeperenye shopping centre, 13 Cactus Street, Alice Springs ?<eos> What else, let me see ...<eos> He has a blue paw and there is a grey mark ...<eos> Ah now, this could help<eos> He has a tattoo on his right ear ...<eos> Well as I said, we found the dog next to the body ... in the apartment of Mr Didion and we thought that someone involved with dog racing might know the dog and therefore the owner<eos> "We are here to celebrate..."<eos> We are here to celebrate the life of Jane Ford.<eos> A woman who enjoyed life for all it could bring
See how the shadow shortens?<eos> At noon, it is at its shortest.<eos> That only tells me how far south I have traveled.<eos> Didn't I just tell you to listen?<eos> The day before sailing, you mark a circle around the pointer where the shadow is at its shortest at noon.<eos> The next day at sea, you place the board back into water around noon and watch the shadow.<eos> - If the shadow only touches the circle...<eos> - Your course remains true?<eos> Yes.<eos> And if it passes outside the circle, like this...

No.<eos> You sleep on top of the bed.<eos> With a blanket over you.<eos> What if I want to sleep in the bed?<eos> Look, you can do what you want, but you will be the only one in this entire prison that does.<eos> You want that?<eos> Be my guest.<eos> Count time!<eos> Count time! Count time, ladies!<eos> That light comes on, you need to be where you're supposed to be, and you don't move until it goes off. Dinner's after.
No, in case anything happens, I need you out here.<eos> Who's on watch?<eos> ( sighs )<eos> Damn it.<eos> ( pulsating tone )<eos> ( gasps )<eos> Ahem.<eos> Alpha waves.<eos> I was trying to induce a meditative state.<eos> I've been having trouble-- your battery, it's over here.
Is my cock exquisite?<eos> Oh, cos I think it's fucking exquisite.
Is my cock exquisite?<eos> Oh, cos I think it's fucking exquisite.<eos> I think it's a fucking work of art.<eos> Like a Renoir.<eos> Or a Picasso.<eos> The painting of my cock should hang at the Louvre.<eos> They should study my cock in art classes, spend whole courses studying the splendid contours of its exquisiteness, don't you think?<eos> They should also study my cock in science class cos it defies nature.

Fucking...<eos> Fuck!<eos> Come on, girl.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, my love.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, live!<eos> I found it, Dom.<eos> I found my hand.<eos> It was hiding underneath one of the cars.
Now not so much.<eos> I mean, it's still loving, but we can't seem to get back on the physical plane, which sucks, but it does afford me certain freedoms.<eos> I wish you were this imaginative in your writing.<eos> I think it would clear the air, right?<eos> I mean, you're obviously a woman that's used to getting what she wants, you know.<eos> And I'm the guy that said "no, thanks"<eos> to your fleshy goodness, which makes me the one that got away.<eos> So you've put me up on this pedestal built of bitterness and regret.<eos> This is exciting, hmm?<eos> The sexual tension-- it's--it's thick. [Laughs]
You always wanted to be an actor, right?<eos> So here's your chance to play the role of the supportive best man.<eos> I'd feel a lot more comfortable if this door stayed open.<eos> The whole wall is glass, and there's like 50 kids walking by.<eos> I don't have time for this, Finn.<eos> Seriously, this seating chart is like a giant sudoku.<eos> Will wants his mother as far away from the bar as possible, and all of you Glee kids have dated so incestuously that I can't even remember who can tolerate who anymore, so...<eos> Look, I'm-I'm worried about not being able to do this.<eos> Being able to look Mr. Shue in the eyes.<eos> Look, I'm really sorry that I don't have a pamphlet handy for you right now, but I'm pretty sure if I did, it would say something like, "Get Over It," okay?
I'm also naturally enhancing my breasts.<eos> Every night, I rub them with cocoa butter,<eos> Vitamin E and wild yams.<eos> Yes, uh, has anybody, uh, seen Sam?<eos> Yeah, I think he's behind that curtain.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> What's up, Marley?<eos> Brad?<eos> Uh, I wrote a song.<eos> I don't know if it's any good.
There you are.<eos> Good dog.<eos> Hey, hon.<eos> You want a hand with the bags?<eos> No, no, no, I got it, I got it.<eos> Get the kids to sleep, they gotta get ready for school tomorrow.<eos> I know it wasn't you, but I couldn't say nothing.<eos> Where the hell did you go?<eos> - Checking out the property.<eos> - It's so big?
I mean, he's a good ol' boy, so you know he talks to be understood, not just to sound good.<eos> So, from him, a "fuck" can mean,<eos> "Holy shit, what did I just get myself into."<eos> Or, "Great pasta." Or "I'm gonna get that guy for that."<eos> So why does a guy like that need to stay up all night writing when he could already express the entire range of human emotions with a single word?<eos> So, you see, as I told you, the tests show the water is fine.<eos> But my water comes out brown when I turn on the faucet.<eos> Perhaps your plumbing is a little bit on the old side, quite simply.<eos> Well, what about the sewage plant I heard about.<eos> It's almost brand new.
This is really good.<eos> You've really improved.<eos> It's because I have a good teacher.<eos> Perhaps, but soon, you won't need him anymore.<eos> So when do you take your exams again? - Next week.<eos> - And what happens if you pass?<eos> Well, um, I guess, I go to Paris and find a job. OK, uh...<eos> Let's find you something a bit tougher to do.<eos> Here we go, a turbine problem.<eos> The water is already brown when it reaches us.
Yes.<eos> And you, sir, is your decision also final?<eos> Yes.<eos> Therefore, you are hereby divorced as specified by Art. 230 of the Civil Code.<eos> I ratify the appended document, which will be attached to the judgment...<eos> Please turn it off.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Marie, it's me.<eos> They've brought the suitcase.<eos> It's broken.
Nothing!<eos> It just keeps everything where it's supposed to be.<eos> Shit, like medically?<eos> No, not medically.<eos> Just to...<eos> It just keeps it right where it's supposed to be.<eos> You got to vent that furnace.<eos> That's a lot of compression and heat.<eos> It gets plenty of ventilation, thank you.<eos> My hand's a foot off and it's on fire.
You had your tongue down his throat.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> It feels like we've been hibernating!<eos> Didn't bother you last night.<eos> Oh, Jesus, ten missed messages.<eos> Will you get him, please?<eos> Wayne, Ashburn wants her underwear back!<eos> I do not!<eos> You cannot take that car!<eos> It's government property.
How did Julian escape?<eos> Federal marshals transferring him got ambushed.<eos> We're not sure whether Larkin's men followed the marshals or got information from the inside.<eos> Isn't it obvious?<eos> Fuck you!<eos> I know when I smell a fucking albino rat.<eos> If you want to point a finger, why don't you point it at yourself?<eos> If you two hadn't brought Julian in,<eos> Larkin would have never known we were on to him!<eos> And this whole case wouldn't be the giant mixed-up bucket of shit that it is now.
Can I get you some water?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Have you figured out how long I've got before it wears off?<eos> To be safe, approximately 3 1/2 hours from the time of your last injection.<eos> Any longer than that, and, uh...<eos> You may become stranded.<eos> I've set this watch accordingly.<eos> And something else-- with every jump, a significant amount of the drug will be burned up in your system.<eos> If it burns up too fast, you may experience symptoms of withdrawal-- disorientation, hallucinations, lapses in time.
I think that's just the sedative kicking in.<eos> Oscillation's coming through clear.<eos> Everything seems to be functioning.<eos> Walter, you're good to go.<eos> You should be feeling pretty relaxed by now.<eos> His blood pressure's rising.<eos> - How much?<eos> - It's 140 over 90.<eos> Now 152 over 100.<eos> It's still rising.
You would not have it any other way.<eos> Do you remember getting a white tulip?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> It was a sign from God.<eos> The tulip was important.<eos> I took it from the other timeline and kept it.<eos> When we devised the plan to stop the invasion you didn't think we could succeed.<eos> I knew the tulip would give you strength, as it had before.<eos> It was your symbol of hope and absolution.<eos> It gave you the courage to push on.
It's our only chance.<eos> Peter, how are you doing with the synchroscope?<eos> No synchroscope yet.<eos> But I found some sort of syringe.<eos> Any idea what that was for or why you had it?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> This tape is addressed to me.<eos> It's your handwriting.<eos> Peter, I sent you a letter.<eos> It contains something of mine.
- Yes you do.<eos> Hair, attitude...<eos> Shit...<eos> I'd ask for a refund.<eos> Your Grace.<eos> Wow. You always bathe with weapons?<eos> Moragh attack a couple years back.<eos> Can't be too careful.<eos> And I thought the door was locked.<eos> - It was.
Mariana!<eos> Stop watching TV, Mariana!<eos> Turn it off.<eos> Come on Claudia, don't be shy, come to the table.<eos> Where's Claudia going to sit, mom?<eos> Oops... In the garden chair.<eos> Bring it inside, sweetie.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's an ugly chair. Sorry!<eos> But it works.
Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, fine. Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm giving it one week.<eos> That's it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Got it?<eos> Yes.<eos> I've got a big interview and I am not gonna have it screwed up... by a bunch of ghosts.
No, I want to know what's going on.<eos> You can go, but Gwendolyn's staying!<eos> Lucy will show us to the door!<eos> You're in danger!<eos> We know what role you're supposed to play, it's all in the Prophecy.<eos> The Count is dangerous, he'll sacrifice you.<eos> - They mustn't win!<eos> - She's lying.<eos> Find the Prophecy of the Ruby!<eos> Trust the Raven's magic, it will save you!
That's enough for today.<eos> I wish I could just leave, go somewhere where no one can find me.<eos> You can't leave...<eos> We're totally dependent on the Lodge and the chronograph.<eos> They've got us in the palm of their hand.<eos> But we can't just carry on as if nothing had happened.<eos> Good night.<eos> No, we can't.<eos> We've got to find the prophecy.<eos> Lucy said it explains everything.
When my wife died...<eos> If I could have gone after ovarian cancer with your rifles...<eos> I would have.<eos> [Dylan, over radio]: Evan.<eos> Dylan.<eos> You all right?<eos> Better than all right. I got me a dinosaur.<eos> Where?<eos> Tennis court.<eos> The creature's fenced in, not that that'll matter if it decides to take off.
You know he'll be back, right?<eos> I was thinking about this, actually.<eos> Three years I've been working on this tech, thinking it would solve everything.<eos> Make up for everything.<eos> Fix everything.<eos> But what if it doesn't, hmm?<eos> The first time I saw you, you had one of those things in your hands. You couldn't keep your eyes off it.<eos> I thought you'd kept your phone from the '90s or something. [Laughs]<eos> Yeah, well, I always make a good first impression.<eos> But that thing, it gave me a gift today.
- a really angry shadow.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> A shadow that protects treasure.<eos> Doesn't that seem, I don't know, strange to you?<eos> - Nuh-uh. - Uh-uh. Seen stranger.<eos> - Not really.<eos> - I've seen stranger.<eos> - Artie!<eos> - Yeah?<eos> That thing, it went down under the carpet, into the floor, now...
I'll run through the database with whatever you've... got so far.<eos> Right.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Artie, are those shelves still unstable from the quakes last week?<eos> Yeah, annoyingly so.<eos> And you are fixing them with a black light? What?<eos> No, no.<eos> This is Jerry Garcia's black light.<eos> It's for Claudia's birthday party.<eos> It enhances visuals of any artwork that it shines on.
Trust me, kid.<eos> I know about these things.<eos> Grab the chance while you still got him.<eos> Well...<eos> Local PD is rounding up the Turks.<eos> The marshal got his man.<eos> We got our thingy.<eos> I'd say, all in all, it's a pretty good day.<eos> I talked to Artie.<eos> The bottle is called, uh, an amphora, and it belonged to a merchant from Pompeii who survived Vesuvius.
Hello?<eos> It's Rae.<eos> Rae, what are you doing here?<eos> I called your number and your wife gave me this address.<eos> Jesus, what have you been doing?<eos> I'm, er, really sorry that you had to see me like that, Rae.<eos> Like what?<eos> I didn't see anything.<eos> What happened to your bookshelf?<eos> Oh, yeah, it thought it could beat me but I had a hammer so there was only ever gonna be one winner.
Got a patterned abrasion here.<eos> Looks like somebody snatched a chain or some kind of necklace off of her.<eos> - Any theories? - Oh.<eos> Other than spy?<eos> Mm, bound wrists, two neat bullet holes to the back... it looks like a hit.<eos> Mm, that abdominal wound, from what I can tell, looks pretty brutal.<eos> More like a crime of passion.<eos> What's that?<eos> Uh, this is, uh, a letter found sewn into the hem of her dress.<eos> Maybe it names the killer.
we will never speak of it.<eos> Sir...<eos> I heard from Linda about a half an hour ago.<eos> The President wants to meet with you.<eos> 8230.<eos> About what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Frank.<eos> You know, when you brought up this idea, I wasn't sold.<eos> It struck me as both desperate and careless.
He doesn't snoop.<eos> He just gets information we need to do our job.<eos> I am notified when he does that now.<eos> Thank you for that.<eos> I never should've told you.<eos> Why are you so interested in such an old case?<eos> Because we have a similar one in Cannes.<eos> Our case is closed.<eos> It's a total resolution.<eos> No, it's not!
- What are you talking about?<eos> Derek's killer.<eos> Theresa finds out about the blackmail money, and then disappears a few days later? That doesn't look good for Ted.<eos> - If Ted is responsible for this...<eos> - I just need time.<eos> Give me one night. Tonight.<eos> Look, Rebecca told me to spy on you, and your dad told me to spy on Rebecca.<eos> I'm doing all of this for you, Mads.<eos> I dropped my hospital keycard somewhere.<eos> Do you guys know where it is?
I would love a cup of joe.<eos> Sorry?<eos> I think Mrs. Carson would like you, my secretary, to get her a cup of coffee.<eos> If it's not too much trouble.<eos> Two sugars in mine, doll.<eos> Oh, I will put a little extra something in yours, doll.<eos> So your husband likes elephants?<eos> Oliver was an archaeologist.<eos> He found this jade relic in India.<eos> He said it had magical powers.
This is Oliver Carson, and he's dead.<eos> All right, well, whoever killed Carson has the elephant.<eos> Either way, we don't.<eos> Pete, this isn't just a story about a missing relic.<eos> If Carson's dead, we're in a murder mystery.<eos> Great.<eos> Now we got to find the missing dingus and put the finger on whoever rubbed out Carson, or we're locked up in crazy town forever.<eos> Why couldn't we have fallen into a cookbook?<eos> "Classic-car buff Artie Weisfelt<eos> "bids a fond farewell to this 1964 convertible "before it leaves for its new home--
Well, now you're gonna listen to me.<eos> Statutory rape, that's hard time.<eos> Look at that...<eos> Ooh. Ibeganto seethat therewasarealchemistry betweenErrolandBeverly.<eos> Hewasso eagertopleaseher, todothingsfor her likeshewasabigstar andhewasher youthfuladmirer.<eos> Iwenteverywhere withthem andmetthebest Hollywoodhadto offer.<eos> Thecrèmede la crème.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello, Woodsey.<eos> Oh, hi, Errol, I love the music box, it's so sweet.
You know, they always do it, they cut the best scenes.<eos> They cut a lot of my lines, as well.<eos> Can't you do something about it? No, no, no.<eos> They're a hard-headed lot.<eos> I gave you up for five months and that's it?<eos> I had a great time. That's not the point, is it?<eos> I don't know, Florence, I think perhaps happiness is the point.<eos> At the end of the day, more important than stardom and Hollywood.<eos> Fame is like a religion in this godless country.<eos> It only provides the public with idols that they can worship and then tear down as the mood strikes them.
This is perfect.<eos> She'll actually respect our opinion now.<eos> We're her peer.<eos> We're just like Harry...<eos> without being idiots.<eos> Wait.<eos> Look at that picture, what she's wearing!<eos> We have to do something.<eos> "In the future, you may not want to wear such a short skirt.<eos> It makes you look like a harlot."
What are you talking about?<eos> Well... You lie about pulling an extra shift. You lie about a child dying, and then you lie about this guy, Hank!<eos> Well, you didn't think to mention him either.<eos> He was outside our house!<eos> Phillip saw him!<eos> I am trying to protect us, okay?<eos> I can't take it when you're mad with me!<eos> Ahh... This is, uh... Deeply saddening.<eos> I mean, Hank was responding well to the E.M.D.R. therapy.<eos> It's rapid-eye movement, quite revolutionary.
Well, did she make any of her other classes?<eos> No, she hasn't.<eos> That made me concerned.<eos> Okay, well, thanks for letting me know.<eos> You're kidding me!<eos> Marta found it?<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> (Laughs) I am gonna cut the hell out of that powder and make us crap-loads of money!<eos> (Lowered voice) Yeah, well, don't wet your pants yet.<eos> I don't know where it is.

Um, well, just tell me where you are, honey, and I'll come get you.<eos> Somewhere in the country.<eos> Why'd you make Denise bring me here?<eos> Where?<eos> Where, honey, where in the country are you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's... a big house, like a farm.<eos> Keep him talking.<eos> What-- what color is the house, Joey?<eos> It's white with black shutters, and it's really big with an upstairs, and it's far from the street, and they won't let me leave the yard.
Sunflower seeds.<eos> Shooter was probably chewing them while waiting for Delgado to show.<eos> Killer was lying in wait.<eos> This was premeditated.<eos> Hello, Mother.<eos> To what do I owe the pleasure?<eos> Well, I have some news, and I wanted to tell you in person.<eos> What's that?<eos> I'm selling the house.<eos> I didn't even know it was on the market.
It wasn't.<eos> A realtor came by with a cash offer from an interested buyer, and it was a very generous one.<eos> You've had that house for 40 years.<eos> You get one offer and you're just gonna...<eos> What?<eos> Take a chance to finally move on with my life?<eos> Okay.<eos> I just don't know how I feel about this.<eos> Well, you never really come by.<eos> So if you expect me to live out my days in a time capsule just because it holds ancient memories, you're mistaken.
It's crackling with revolution.<eos> The Poplar docks are on strike.<eos> Did our friends give us what we asked for?<eos> How much?<eos> £200.<eos> Who did you meet?<eos> An attache from the Russian embassy.<eos> In a Chinese restaurant.<eos> Our revolution is international.<eos> And it grows by the day.
Come on.<eos> Go.<eos> Thanks.<eos> We have to stop them.<eos> Are you my mother?<eos> - Yes, give us a hug.<eos> That tickles.<eos> I'm gonna need a little help here.<eos> Get the power source.<eos> It's in his chest.
It's cold.<eos> So... ..how'd you get on with Charlie yesterday?<eos> - Yeah, sound.<eos> Yeah, nice girl.<eos> - Yeah, she is, she is.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, erm, what?<eos> You looking at houses and shit?<eos> Yeah, we went to look at this house.<eos> It was nice, mate, you should buy it.
You and I are a powerhouse.<eos> Hello dear, the big boss is expecting me.<eos> Why that face?<eos> Did you read the business plan?<eos> Read it! - I read it.<eos> You want to expand, hire, buy land...<eos> And you're certain you'll have a 30% return within a year.<eos> 30-40%, Giampiero, it's a conservative estimate.<eos> It's not exactly a gift, you know...<eos> You'll give me 700,000 but I'm using my house as collateral, it's worth at least 900.
- I need Phillies tickets.<eos> - Oh, I can do that.<eos> This Thursday...<eos> It's completely sold out.<eos> Then, no.<eos> I need two tickets, best seats in the house, spare no expense.<eos> Thank you, Josh.<eos> And what that is is a tumor on the blood vessels in your brain.<eos> That tumor...<eos> It's pressing on your limbic cortex, and that's your pleasure center.
And you'd think there'd be an unsettling feeling about something so drastically different, but there's something else.<eos> You don't miss anything.<eos> You're not homesick.<eos> It puts you in this state.<eos> The air and the water are all the same temperature as your body.<eos> It's sensory-- the music, the fragrance, the breeze, and the blue.<eos> Stan.<eos> Ahem.<eos> It's just a sketch.<eos> Hawaiian legend has it that the soul can go in and out of the body, but that it usually leaves from a leeward point into the waves.
It's still a lie, Lana.<eos> You put it in your book just so you could sell more copies.<eos> You sold out.<eos> I'm a writer.<eos> It's my job to tell the essence of truth.<eos> Is that why you called me your roommate?<eos> I was your lover, but in your book, I was covered in a cloak of asexuality.<eos> Our life together disappeared.<eos> That part of my life wasn't pertinent to the book.<eos> It would have distracted the reader from the central theme.
So that's why they sent a copper from Belfast.<eos> Maybe, maybe not.<eos> Thomas, you're a bookmaker, a robber, a fighting man, you're not a fool.<eos> You sell those guns to anyone who has use to 'em, you will hang!<eos> Dump them somewhere the police can find them.<eos> Maybe if they know they haven't fallen into the wrong hands this might blow over.<eos> Tell Charlie to dump them tonight.<eos> No.<eos> He won't move contraband under a full moon.<eos> Three days until it wanes.
No. You want me to read it to you?<eos> Hold on. I'm not awake yet.<eos> Okay, go ahead.<eos> All right, now the headline is...<eos> "CIA officer linked to Langley bomber."<eos> "A CIA case officer may have had a sexual relationship with Congressman Nicholas Brody in the days and weeks leading up to the attack on Langley, according to anonymous sources.<eos> Because the officer still has active agents in the field, her identity is being withheld."<eos> We are pragmatists. We adapt.<eos> We are not keepers of some sacred flame.<eos> It doesn't have to be sacred.
It's not over yet, Serika.<eos> I thought this was an SM club.<eos> I was looking forward to Japanese bondage.<eos> Western whips just hurt;<eos> they're not my style.<eos> Oh, of course!<eos> Damn right.<eos> Madam, if I may...<eos> Real whips are nothing like that.<eos> Flesh tears, you get covered in blood... and your cock doesn't get hard, it shrinks.
I don't want to go there with you, Max!<eos> I don't want to go there!<eos> I want to go to Tokyo, and I want to be a princess!<eos> Wow.<eos> Wow, well...<eos> I guess you should go.<eos> Cronus, welcome to the Offshore!<eos> If I could have your attention, everyone.<eos> Uh, please don't forget about the ice luge.<eos> It's slowly melting.
Rabies is the oldest virus known to man.<eos> Aristotle wrote about it in 300 B.C.<eos> Totally unique.<eos> Doesn't enter the body through the bloodstream.<eos> Travels through the nervous system.<eos> Is that why the incubation times vary so wildly?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Anywhere from a few days to several years.<eos> Depends on how close to the brain the bite is and how fast the infection travels through the neurons.<eos> And when it reaches the brain, it spreads like wildfire.
You excel in art class.<eos> Would you like to go to an art school?<eos> Maybe. You know what you wanna do?<eos> You know what you wanna be?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I want you to stay on that soccer team because that could be so helpful.<eos> Can I go to the bathroom real quick?<eos> I'm literally punching myself that I didn't buy that dress yesterday.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> No, honestly, it looks so fucking good on me.
My look.<eos> Please don't tell me, after four years, You don't actually know the look.<eos> You gotta understand... You know what?<eos> I'm not talking about this right now.<eos> Good morning, lanie.<eos> Not from the way you sound.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Men are clueless.<eos> Men or just Castle?<eos> Well, no matter how miserable your day is, it's not as bad as Michelle Twohey's.
I'm not commander of much anymore.<eos> And I was with the unit in rockville when they came and caught us by surprise.<eos> Never thought I'd see anything like that again.<eos> We saw them take out the West Chester camp.<eos> They're taking us all out.<eos> It's a full-on extermination.<eos> - So what's the plan?<eos> - Plan?<eos> This resistance?<eos> It's over.
Herbert, Richard, Harold, Beatrice, Elizabeth and George.<eos> Another George.<eos> They're my family.<eos> We belong here.<eos> Why up here?<eos> No burials in the churchyard.<eos> They thought the dead could contaminate the living.<eos> She carried her dead children up here to put them in the ground.<eos> That picture...<eos> It's in all of my dreams.
You were against torture, and now you're torturing.<eos> Against corruption, and now you're corrupt.<eos> Who brought Morsi into power?<eos> The people.<eos> Because they felt you guys were an oppressed people.<eos> This document will allow what happened to you to happen to me.<eos> Do you accept that?<eos> Of course not.<eos> OK, then take this constitution.<eos> It doesn't serve me.
- I am.<eos> - I'm Bradley Martin.<eos> Oh, we're friends with Norman from school and we're going to the library, and we were wondering if he wanted to come study with us.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey, Norman.<eos> I'm sure he would love to go, but we're in the middle of a lot of stuff.<eos> We still have unpacking to do.<eos> I totally understand.<eos> I like your house.<eos> It's so cool.
I couldn't get in, and Kelly didn't answer the door.<eos> And I heard her cry and I got worried, so I ran around to the back door.<eos> I went in, and when I got inside she was laying on the ground, uh, rubbing her eyes and screaming.<eos> Did you see this guy near the house?<eos> He might have been the guy I saw inside.<eos> I did see a car pull away really fast, across the street.<eos> You didn't see who was driving?<eos> - No.<eos> - Can you describe the car?<eos> Uh, it was old.
And I heard her cry and I got worried, so I ran around to the back door.<eos> I went in, and when I got inside she was laying on the ground, uh, rubbing her eyes and screaming.<eos> Did you see this guy near the house?<eos> He might have been the guy I saw inside.<eos> I did see a car pull away really fast, across the street.<eos> You didn't see who was driving?<eos> - No.<eos> - Can you describe the car?<eos> Uh, it was old.<eos> It had tail fins.
Talk to me!<eos> I...<eos> I...<eos> Good morning.<eos> Morning.<eos> Were you here the whole time?<eos> Well, I'm worried.<eos> Thank you,<eos> This clock is broken.<eos> Yes, it's broken.
I...<eos> I...<eos> Good morning.<eos> Morning.<eos> Were you here the whole time?<eos> Well, I'm worried.<eos> Thank you,<eos> This clock is broken.<eos> Yes, it's broken.<eos> It had stopped.
Everybody thinks I did it.<eos> You think I wanted to work for my father's company?<eos> I wanted to run for office.<eos> But that night changed everything.<eos> Next up is rabbit. Look low.<eos> Too bad.<eos> You want to know what it feels like to have the world think you're a murderer?<eos> You feel like a murderer.<eos> If you didn't kill anybody, your conscience should be clear.<eos> It is clear, isn't it, Eddie?
You're probably right.<eos> It's just that, since Vivian died, I can't shake this feeling that I'm going to lose them all.<eos> In a way, I lost Edward 16 years ago.<eos> He was such a good boy.<eos> Serious, but so sweet.<eos> I used to call him Eddie spaghetti.<eos> That got a smile.<eos> Oh, my little spaghetti is gone.<eos> Life's a bitch.<eos> It can be.
Go.<eos> Go.<eos> Go.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> Is the queen really in danger?<eos> Okay, I noticed something odd down by the creek.<eos> There's this weird tent.<eos> It's not one of ours.<eos> It's kind of creepy.
Oh, so you like things of a kinky nature, do you?<eos> Yes, I can be discreet.<eos> 'Cause the thing is...<eos> I'm gay.<eos> Huh?<eos> But you sleep with women all the time.<eos> Yeah, as a cover, but it's not working anymore.<eos> My family finds out, they'll disown me, plus I'll lose any chance of getting any big endorsement deals, so I need a steady girlfriend.<eos> If you sign on, I can get you anything you ask for... new car, jewelry, a better apartment.<eos> All you have to do is act like our relationship is happy and perfect and complete when it's actually not.
How could you do this to me?<eos> Can't find out about pack four.<eos> This is absurd.<eos> I don't have time for your espionage stories, and I don't have time to be hauled in here at your every whim.<eos> If you'd like to talk to me again, please contact my attorneys.<eos> She's lying.<eos> She's being blackmailed.<eos> Which could mean that she had a motive to kill Nick.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, Browning lied about her knowledge of the SD card and whatever information it contained.
MAW MAW:<eos> Of course he's right.<eos> A nice diamond ring gives you something pretty to focus on when your fat, sweaty husband's wheezing on top of you like a dying walrus.<eos> Whoo!<eos> (chuckling)<eos> That never gets old.<eos> (snorts) I was telling Jimmy how hard I worked for your...<eos> Hey, where's your engagement ring?<eos> Oh, I always take it off when I wash the dishes.<eos> It's probably by the sink.
(chuckling)<eos> That never gets old.<eos> (snorts) I was telling Jimmy how hard I worked for your...<eos> Hey, where's your engagement ring?<eos> Oh, I always take it off when I wash the dishes.<eos> It's probably by the sink.<eos> You're gonna go get it, right?<eos> I'll grab it in the morning.<eos> I never wear it at night.<eos> But it'd be safer in your jewelry box.
That old lady's a nut.<eos> Every time I go in the bathroom, I catch her above the sink trying to copy everything I do.<eos> Case... closed.<eos> Unless you guys want to look around, make sure nothing else is missing.<eos> Virginia's engagement ring is missing.<eos> ROSS:<eos> Missing?<eos> Or deliberately hidden because there's a little trouble in paradise?<eos> There's no trouble, Ross.<eos> It's just missing.
Of course not, he's a guy.<eos> They can identify our nipples from 40 feet away through a wool sweater, but they have no idea what our rings look like.<eos> So why not try this?<eos> Because I'll know.<eos> Oh, I love that ring.<eos> Burt worked so hard to get it.<eos> And it's always been there for me, whether I needed to look at it to remind myself how much he loved me... (voice breaking):<eos> Oh, I can't believe it's gone.<eos> Oh.<eos> I was sure it was safe to pawn because it's so cheap and dinged up, I... and I knew no one else would ever want it.
- Where to?<eos> Anywhere.<eos> What was that about?<eos> Just saying good-bye.<eos> Terrible thing, Vivian's death.<eos> Bobby, how long has it been?<eos> Don't you ever come near my family, ever again.<eos> Do you wanna know what it feels like to have the world think you're a murderer?<eos> If you didn't kill anybody, conscience should be clear.<eos> It is clear, isn't it, Eddie?
Is there anything that we can do?<eos> Do you have any more options?<eos> I mean, I know you have some cash. Not nearly enough.<eos> It's like I'm underwater here.<eos> Well, let me check into your finances again.<eos> We'll figure something out.<eos> [ Cellphone ringing ]<eos> Excuse me.<eos> [ Cellphone beeps ] Hey, Georgia.<eos> Riley, whatever you did with the client list, make sure it's good and hidden.
We are going through a very private thing in front of millions of people, and, well, that can start to get to you.<eos> You know, sometimes... sometimes you'll just do things that you can't explain.<eos> You know, one minute I want a burrito and then the next minute you're freaking out because a button flew off your coat, and now here I am, crying on national television like an idiot.<eos> Here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> (choking up): It's just that pregnancy is a really beautiful time in a woman's life.<eos> This is the first time she seems human.<eos> Yeah, she does.<eos> It's just so intense.<eos> I mean, we made a person and it lives inside of her.
Okay, what happened?<eos> (Whispers) I'm having a stroke.<eos> Okay. Let me check your pulse.<eos> Am I smiling?<eos> You are smiling.<eos> Is my tongue straight?<eos> Your tongue is straight.<eos> (Whispers) It's my tongue.<eos> Is my tongue straight?<eos> Yes, it is.
Well, I...<eos> Come on!<eos> We can't give up.<eos> We have to find out who he's seeing.<eos> Last thing Daddy needs is some trashy strumpet using his fragile heart as a way to his money.<eos> Now, what makes you think that this person is trashy?<eos> Well, this cheap hooker bra she left at my house for starters.<eos> Oh...!<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> I bet whoever it is has taste, and wants it back 'cause it's so expensive.
Tack it onto your kid dancing for a second. Put that on facebook.<eos> Everybody will write the same thing.<eos> "that's adorable!<eos> I think I see a future star!"<eos> Don't tape shit on your--<eos> Life is short.<eos> Life is very short.<eos> I like life.<eos> I like it.<eos> I feel like even if it ends up being short, I got lucky to have it 'cause life is an amazing gift When you think about what you get with a basic life,
Where would police take Jeep?<eos> If I find out will you go?<eos> You will get me that Jeep, or I will put bullet in your little girl's ear.<eos> Hey, Rodney, it's Billy.<eos> Okay, so look, I got a '95 white Jeep Cherokee.<eos> Seventy-eight thousand miles, give or take.<eos> And look--<eos> Sorry.<eos> Look, man, it's gonna be the same deal.<eos> Okay. Wait two weeks, things calm down they'll think it's going to the heap.
What exactly is this theory of Dr. Kimble's?<eos> And what were in those papers that were taken?<eos> So, Dr. Kimble's area of expertise is cognitive science.<eos> 30 years ago, he came up with this theory that TV could be ushering in an era of some sort of shared awareness, a collective consciousness.<eos> I know how it sounds.<eos> It was a pretty crazy theory at the time.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe it was just ahead of its time.<eos> And since then, TV's gotten all the more pervasive.<eos> I mean, it's everywhere.
You'll still be able to get some good playtime with Winona like you said, though, won't you?<eos> She tends to get a little wild if she doesn't get her exercise.<eos> Exercise, sure, of course.<eos> I don't remember seeing critters on the invite list.<eos> That's because we're leaving them here with Spike.<eos> He's gonna do a little critter sitting for us.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> So sorry I'm late.<eos> Silly bunny had hidden his brush.<eos> Be sure you get plenty on his tail or it won't get as poofy as he likes it.
Danny led me to believe you had some pull around here.<eos> You need to be quiet while I get a reading, okay?<eos> You know, the doc'll be in as soon as I check your vitals.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, how you feeling?<eos> Fine.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, your blood pressure says differently.<eos> It's through the roof.
We're gonna talk about this.<eos> Listen, I know you guys like to go to mom because she's Mr. tough guy problem-solver.<eos> She gets results. Yeah, she does.<eos> She does. You're right.<eos> Like the last time we got pizza from our favorite place here. Remember that?<eos> We got shortchanged, she cursed a blue streak and got our money back?<eos> How's that pizza, by the way?<eos> - Pretty good.<eos> - It's okay. - Liars!<eos> It's garbage.
My father got the owners of the "Herald," the "News," of our biggest radio station, a few bankers, the six men who run Miami, to join together and finally stop those gangsters.<eos> How?<eos> Every week, they'd put one of those rats on the front page of the paper-- a big picture, give their names, addresses, what crimes they were committing here, every week, right there for the city to see.<eos> You know, I remember that.<eos> It worked.<eos> Sure did.<eos> So I guess there was some good my father did.<eos> What?<eos> Listen, the mob is behind this gambling bill.<eos> It will pass this time.
Look, I will give you your pants back, but...<eos> I don't know anything about a ring, I swear.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Well, I guess the, uh... good news is he's not all gay.<eos> No, Teddy is still gay.<eos> We're not having a baby together like that.<eos> Look, I'm sorry that I'm coming to you with this.<eos> I know that you guys are speaking again, and... family is so important to Teddy.<eos> It is.
I haven't had sex with someone who mattered in a long time.<eos> And now I'm sober, and I'm in a good place, but in some ways I'm still a mess.<eos> I'm giving you an out.<eos> What do you want on your toast, salsa or ice cream?<eos> What are you lookin' at?<eos> You.<eos> No, what are you looking at?<eos> I have a freckle.<eos> What about it?<eos> It looks like Indiana.
It's one thing I got right.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Don't be.<eos> I don't deserve it.<eos> May I?<eos> Eh.<eos> Do you mind putting the book down, just for a minute?<eos> Randall.<eos> Your pancreatitis is being caused by a tumor.<eos> It has metastasized.
You know, I was not altogether sure<eos> - you were gonna show.<eos> - Really?<eos> Mm.<eos> I guess this means you've reconsidered my reputation.<eos> No. No, I just figured mine's so dodgy, you know, what the hell?<eos> Cool.<eos> Then we should be dodgy together.<eos> Wow.<eos> Your approach, it's... it's improving.
Hey, hold up a sec, will you?<eos> I like to get that stuff out of the way right up front.<eos> Or... maybe you're not ready to let things go with your wife.<eos> Ex-wife.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> That was so dull.<eos> It was... boring.<eos> You did... you did warn me, but, I mean... that joke... what was that joke?<eos> The proctologist and the flowers.<eos> Yeah, did it even have a punch line?
You're not gonna see the same behavioral problems<eos> - because we're gonna-- - Because she'll be locked in a box.<eos> That is not fair.<eos> You can't go ahead with this transfer.<eos> Is she stable enough to travel?<eos> Yes.<eos> - But I don't think that it--<eos> - Get her ready.<eos> I'm ordering an ambulance.<eos> We'll leave as soon as it gets here.
In fact...<eos> I was hoping to present this with a cupcake or something.<eos> Happy graduation.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> It's human bone.<eos> Oh.<eos> Legend says it was worn by the 2,000-year-old witch Qetsiyah, who drew on it...<eos> For strength.<eos> Bonnie, you have come so far so fast.<eos> If you trust my opinion, your magic is exactly where it needs to be.
And as much as I want to help you, tell you what to do, those choices will be yours alone.<eos> The only advice I can give you, sons, is to examine who you are as men.<eos> Figure out what's important to you.<eos> Know yourselves.<eos> Juice, heads up!<eos> Know what's in your heart.<eos> This is our exit, Rat.<eos> Don't be swayed by fear or history or the opinions of outsiders.<eos> Find your own truth.<eos> It will lead you to the things you love.
I don't need to impress anyone.<eos> Why?<eos> Can you just go and practise your speech? Jeez!<eos> All right.<eos> See you later.<eos> Oh, Liz, it's looking beautiful.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> It's too busy.<eos> And I love my scarf. Thank you.<eos> Does it go with the outfit?
Thanks.<eos> But um... you know, it must be hard for him.<eos> Getting used to her not being around.<eos> Why don't you just go over there? See if he's all right.<eos> I reckon I've done enough.<eos> Why can't they just be happy?<eos> Because it would be boring.<eos> Hey, have you noticed Davidson's wearing an engagement ring?<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What's it like?
Come on.<eos> You know, I could use a place to stay while I'm getting my sea legs back under me, George.<eos> And you got a nice place here.<eos> What do you say?<eos> George?<eos> I hope George has been food shopping.<eos> I'm famished.<eos> So this book contains a list of the names of the guys you've been hunting.<eos> And this book, your mother's, has the same list of names.<eos> It's identical.
Oh, and, uh, if you ever do send that letter, you're in the same boat as me.<eos> Harvey, you're looking determined.<eos> - I am.<eos> - What can I do for you?<eos> Look, I know we had an arrangement, but I came here to change it.<eos> Change it?<eos> But you might not even win.<eos> I've just heard about this new special prosecutor.<eos> Relax, the case was always gonna be hard.<eos> It just got a little harder.
Of course you do.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Mary, you've gone through a hideous time.<eos> But now you must remember your son.<eos> He needs you... very much.<eos> I know.<eos> The truth is, I don't think I'm going to be a very good mother.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because somehow, with Matthew's death, all the softness that he found in me seems to have dried up and drained away.<eos> Maybe it was only ever there in his imagination.
Something you remember from your childhood?<eos> Actually, I have never seen it.<eos> Just as I have never held the warm soil of my homeland in my hands.<eos> Like the rest of my comrades, I was born on the ships that set out from our world hundreds of years ago.<eos> All I know of the Catarius is an image in a data file and through a poem my brother read to me when I was young.<eos> You never told me that you had a brother.<eos> He...<eos> He is deceased.<eos> On a planet orbiting one of those spots of light up there -- a most weary, un-bright cinder far from the home I have never known.<eos> He was born to war, grew up in it, and it eventually claimed him.
Okay, facial function.<eos> Still twitching.<eos> Syringe.<eos> I was worried I missed the whole thing.<eos> Where are we at?<eos> Where we're at is, I'm trying to focus.<eos> I mean, how long has the patient been open?<eos> Counting the minutes I'm wasting answering your questions?<eos> I'd have fewer questions, but your intern told me that the surgery had been moved to 3:00.<eos> Clearly, it wasn't.
Well, you're not gonna believe who stopped by last night to see me...<eos> Adalind.<eos> I think Adalind had something to do with you getting beat up.<eos> I have something that she wants.<eos> This gets you out of the way.<eos> You have 48 hours to get the key from Nick.<eos> And why am I not refusing?<eos> Because if you don't, the Grimm will be told of your real identity.<eos> Aunt Marie's trailer.<eos> Do you know where it is now?
What if you're here for a reason, what if you coming back in time wasn't an accident?<eos> - You're talking about fate.<eos> - No, I'm talking about design.<eos> I'm talking about me.<eos> Yeah, I put some of the pieces together.<eos> That we were sent back by you.<eos> So why did I send you back here to help me?<eos> Well that's obvious, to...<eos> to change the future.<eos> Your destiny is not to become Santech CEO Alec Sadler, it's bigger.
You know how powerful these suits are.<eos> I don't need you to tell me about something I invented.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Is there any way we could track the suit if the owner wasn't wearing it?<eos> Well, the suit has certain latent functions on its own.<eos> Something called a positional contact relay.<eos> It's basically like a homing beacon.<eos> It'll pin the user's CMR and it'll triangulate the suit's location.<eos> What if it's out of power?
It's just a sprain...<eos> That's not what I'm talking about.<eos> You and Ricky are lucky to be alive.<eos> Look, I didn't take anything, okay?<eos> But Ricky did.<eos> You have no idea what you're dealing with, Alec.<eos> This isn't some everyday joy ride.<eos> I said I didn't take anything, jeez, just back off.<eos> This drug, Flash, it shouldn't be around for decades.<eos> Are you saying it's from the future?
Cousin Johnny.<eos> All right.<eos> You gentlemen like ice cream?<eos> I love a peanut Buster parfait.<eos> Shh.<eos> Shh.<eos> Shh.<eos> But Dairy Queen?<eos> Dairy Queens are like California real estate.<eos> Value may dip every now and then, but it always goes back up in the summertime.
Just put the joint out, or I'm gonna lose my job, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> So this sentence here.<eos> "He felt like he was choking inside on some black smoke."<eos> That-- I love-- I love that image.<eos> But I think it would be better if you just moved it to the end of the paragraph.<eos> - Yeah. - See?<eos> It just has more impact.
The beginning of time.<eos> I've done my end of the bargain.<eos> Now it's your turn.<eos> Yes?<eos> The fbi?<eos> How close?<eos> Hank, I promised you answers, And a man of the cloth keeps his word.<eos> Your life is a direct result of project zero hour, A scientific program That harnesses the power of the true cross<eos> To bring about the end of days. How?<eos> The cross, if it's even real, is just a piece of wood.
That is not your choice to make.<eos> I am the commander of the submarine.<eos> It is.<eos> Commander, sir.<eos> We're veering--<eos> And i am the commander of the mission!<eos> The church has spoken.<eos> The 12 have lost their way.<eos> The location of the cross must be secret.<eos> If it is in public, it is in danger.
Mr. Galliston, What is this about?<eos> The more you know, the more danger you'll be in.<eos> Tell him to call me.<eos> Tidal charts from 1938.<eos> The night the submarine was here... Ultra low tide.<eos> This bay would have been the only place deep enough With realistic access to the shoreline To bury the cross.<eos> Then this is it.<eos> on the map here... There's "passionblomst kapel"?<eos> What does that mean, peace corps girl?<eos> Well, there's one way A passionflower could survive out here, And that's if it isn't a flower at all.
We both know you didn't kill Amelia's mother.<eos> How can I trust you?<eos> Look, we both want to take down Aster Corps.<eos> These people had my mother killed.<eos> Think I'm going to let them get away with that?<eos> Besides, you don't have much of a choice, do you?<eos> What now?<eos> I got you out, the rest is up to you.<eos> Here's your car.<eos> It's outside in Lot B.
That's not possible.<eos> Unfortunately, it is.<eos> It explains why you're peeing blood.<eos> I'm a woman.<eos> Yeah, you are.<eos> But at one point, physically, you were a man.<eos> Your C.T. showed remnants of your male reproductive tract, including your prostate...<eos> With a tumor.<eos> I thought I got rid of that part of me.<eos> And now here it is...
The stakes are too high.<eos> You know it's not going to change anything, right?<eos> We're still talking about the box, right?<eos> It's almost as if you sent it to yourself so we could have this exact conversation.<eos> Oh, my God, you're diabolical.<eos> You did send it to yourself, didn't you?<eos> Get away from me!<eos> Jenna! Looks like that didn't go over well.<eos> Yeah, it usually doesn't.<eos> Yeah. All right, we gotta talk to her while it's still fresh.
I was thinking...<eos> Maybe it's time we brought in help.<eos> - He's not gonna like it.<eos> - He will learn to like it.<eos> We talking about Jerry?<eos> Fitz's father?<eos> That's... that's brilliant.<eos> I wondered why he wasn't on the trail.<eos> I figured maybe his health wasn't good.<eos> Oh, it's good.
Well, I knew you had moxie, but showing your face back here so soon, if I weren't so intrigued, I'd be shocked.<eos> I'm here to protect an investment.<eos> And what investment would that be?<eos> My time whilst in your family's employ.<eos> I believe I may still be owed a few dividends.<eos> Blackmail.<eos> Of course.<eos> Is there anything that isn't beneath you?<eos> - I don't want hush money. - Oh?<eos> The truth is, it would be unwise for me to start over in a place where my ability to hold any number of secrets might not be as valued as it is in the Grayson fold.
Something's wrong.<eos> I've seen people get slammed.<eos> The whales, they're just playing or-- or they're upset for a second.<eos> It was just something that happened, you know?<eos> This culture of "You get back on the horse and you dive back in the water.<eos> And if you're hurt, well, then we've got other people that will replace you."<eos> And, "You came a long way.<eos> Are you sure you want that?"<eos> A Sea World trainer is recovering today after a terrifying ordeal in front of a horrified audience.<eos> For some reason, the whale just took a different approach to what it was going to do with a very senior, very experienced trainer, Ken Peters, and dragged him to the bottom of the pool and held him at the bottom.
Mayor Gainey's trying to hijack our berry business.<eos> Looks like he might just get it, too.<eos> Ah, yep.<eos> Just like he stole our Mardi Gras.<eos> Mm.<eos> Sneaky bastard.<eos> That he is.<eos> That he is.<eos> This commercial running already?<eos> No, it doesn't air for another three days.
Whose couch?<eos> (groans quietly)<eos> It's, uh, Lily Anne's couch.<eos> Look, don't freak out.<eos> Me and Lily Anne, we're ancient history.<eos> Great.<eos> You enjoy that couch.<eos> But don't even think about all the other things that you should've been vaccinated against before sleeping on it.<eos> Just like old times.<eos> (clears throat) No, not until you, uh, throw a beer bottle at my head, it shatters against the wall, and the neighbors call the police.
If he was holding Christine captive in the room, maybe he went to get her.<eos> So, what's his next move?<eos> He can't take this car, not looking the way it does.<eos> Check it out.<eos> Gold paint.<eos> Look at that.<eos> What, is that transfer?<eos> Somebody pulled out of here in a hurry.<eos> Boyd switched cars.<eos> Let's get this paint back to the lab, see if we can find the vehicle it came from.
Come on. Come on.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Think so. Er, yeah.<eos> - Oh, whoa, whoa. - Sorry.<eos> You need to sit down. Just for a second.<eos> You just need to sit down there.<eos> - You all right?<eos> Oh, your poor car.<eos> No, don't worry about that.<eos> It always looks like that.
The Morrison girls were last seen Monday night.<eos> Did you see them at all?<eos> No.<eos> But Morrison sounded drunk and belligerent again.<eos> It was about 10:00.<eos> He didn't tell you that, did he?<eos> Were both cars home?<eos> Well, I'm not spying on the guy or anything, but we were out here a little later.<eos> I noticed his car was gone.<eos> Then when I turned "Letterman" off, it was back.
The marshals finally came through.<eos> A life packed up and inventoried.<eos> Ellen certainly didn't leave much behind.<eos> Well, she knew she was being uprooted.<eos> She only held on to things with sentimental value.<eos> Or something that could tear the lid off a dirty police division.<eos> That's the key.<eos> I've never seen anything like it.<eos> It's in two pieces.<eos> How do we find the evidence box it opens?
Well, that's the question.<eos> I don't see any point of impact within the car.<eos> What's part two?<eos> The air bags.<eos> Although the driver's side air bag did not deploy, this young lady's is in perfect working order.<eos> Her head was already bleeding when it hit the bag.<eos> Uh, precisely.<eos> Miss Sciuto will have to tell us exactly what this blood spatter here is saying, but, from what I can see in front of me...<eos> You think she was beaten.<eos> While she was in the car, before it went over the ridge.
What tipped you off?<eos> My rosy complexion?<eos> Yes, I've seen nothing of your drab little land yet, but I am interested in your work.<eos> Well, you're a little late. I've been shut down.<eos> And I can't bring back dead loved ones, anyway, if that's what you're after.<eos> I think my deceased are best kept where they are, dearie, thank you very much.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Um... my interest is in how you do whatcha do.<eos> You see, where I come from, we do things... differently.<eos> Your land has witchcraft, but it's feeble, neglected stuff.

John and I only said yes to this dinner 'cause we figured that you'd kill it.<eos> We need to work on our good cop/bad cop.<eos> So what's up?<eos> I was wondering if maybe you wanted to get out of here, go have some fun.<eos> Would this involve heels?<eos> Could.<eos> So you have a Frida Kahlo letter and you want to sell it?<eos> If it's actually worth anything.<eos> My dad gave it to me.<eos> I'm sure it's a fake.
There you are.<eos> Good news.<eos> I found your car.<eos> I... didn't realize that it was lost.<eos> Wade reported it missing yesterday.<eos> Oops. I guess I let that cat out of the bag.<eos> I'll drop your car off later.<eos> He lost it?<eos> Okay. Well, maybe it was camouflaged into the background.<eos> Is it green?
Hey.<eos> I heard that.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm just preparing him for the inevitable.<eos> 'Cause I think this week they're gonna read that book,<eos> "Why Grandma Keeps Tripping Over Her Boobs."<eos> Guys. Guys. Last night, I had a dream.<eos> Just like Dr. Martin Luther King.<eos> No.<eos> Way better.<eos> Okay, the three of us, the Inglorious Baxters, are going to reunite to make a viral video so popular, it'll make me famous!
Rathus.<eos> Little Wolf.<eos> Nizar. - That hurt my hand.<eos> - You'll live.<eos> - How is Sukar?<eos> - Still sleeping the deep sleep.<eos> We came here for more of his medicine and supplies.<eos> Now Earth Republic soldiers tell us we can't leave town.<eos> The great sickness has come.<eos> If it spreads, I fear Humans will once again hunt and kill us.
Open for trade during light of day, secured as sun retires.<eos> And the other?<eos> Set against cliffs, running up to the canyons of Melia Ridge.<eos> Impassable during winter months, which are already upon its peak.<eos> I would not find ourselves trapped there.<eos> Nor I.<eos> How stands the main gate?<eos> Formidable, once sealed.<eos> Could a few men from within see it opened, beneath cover of night?<eos> It is well defended, and you would be absent means.
I would have house in order before we take leave from it.<eos> I thought honored position all but mine.<eos> Now I fear he favors another.<eos> Then you stand as your mother, bound by blood and inconsiderate worth.<eos> It is a thing of rare beauty.<eos> Is it not?<eos> Yes, Dominus.<eos> You will carry it when you face Spartacus?<eos> I shall carry my father's sword.<eos> It is not as well bred or considered as this... yet it holds deeper meaning.
I would see it opened as well.<eos> At last he falls to fucking reason.<eos> Well you mistake me.<eos> I do not give command to see Crassus' men engaged.<eos> Then what moves purpose?<eos> I would see what remains of our Roman guests released.<eos> You set them free?<eos> You have lost fucking mind.<eos> As you have lost voice in all decisions of worth.<eos> Attempt to raise gate in advance of my word. And you will find it forever shut behind you.
I've set aside one of the finest villas for you to rest and see yourself to bath, until such a time.<eos> A gesture unexpected, yet much appreciated.<eos> Gratitude.<eos> Preening little fuck.<eos> A sentiment shared.<eos> Yet he holds the ear of the Senate, and I would see him well satisfied to further bolster tale of our victory carried back to Rome.<eos> You speak again of victory shrouded from discerning eye.<eos> Spartacus yet lives, with considerable force aiding him upon Melia Ridge.<eos> There is no escape from the ridge.<eos> It stands impassable.
You would be lost as well.<eos> Gannicus will not fall to wind and ice.<eos> Wine forever in his blood will keep him warm.<eos> I have never favored the cold.<eos> Share blanket, and see yourself warmed.<eos> I have no need for it.<eos> Your teeth threaten to shake from head.<eos> As do mine.<eos> Your wound gives pain?<eos> It reminds that I yet live.
Five hundred?<eos> Take my life as I know you desire...<eos> And end theirs as well.<eos> Fuck the gods.<eos> You honored Agron well.<eos> As you shall honor Crixus.<eos> For you!<eos> I would have my sword returned to me, slave.<eos> You claim the sword as your own?<eos> The way it fits hand,

Do you want to die twice, motherfucker?<eos> Get the fuck out of here.<eos> Here's the one thing that that doesn't consider, is that it is illegal for money to exchange hands in cyberspace.<eos> Uh, it is, for now, but I expect that to change.<eos> Well, what if it doesn't?<eos> Or what if it doesn't within ten years?<eos> Or within 20 years?<eos> And, uh, good old Pincus is pissing in his diaper in a nursing home somewhere unable to afford his pudding cup.<eos> The law is gonna change, Jeannie.<eos> Unless it doesn't.

Oh, you're a self-made man?<eos> I guess.<eos> Well, that's something we have in common.<eos> Well, Dale, if you want to continue to enjoy the fruits of your labour...<eos> I'm gonna need you to tell me your real name.<eos> I told you.<eos> It's Dale Haywood.<eos> You got my driver's licence.<eos> Yeah, the thing is, driver's licence, birth certificate, IDs...<eos> They don't mean much these days, technology being what it is.
- Same rule.<eos> Call him.<eos> Say you've heard a report and you want confirmation.<eos> When he denies it, then I really won't be able to run it.<eos> You can't run it now.<eos> Why don't I just call him and tell him--<eos> I can just call him.<eos> I could call him and say, "I know your name.<eos> I know your name, and if Troy Davis dies, I'm reporting that you were the swing vote.<eos> I'm reporting your name, your address, and I'm gonna throw a Google Earth image of your house up on the screen so we have a record of what it looked like before it was set on fire."
Woo-hoe!<eos> We're almost there.<eos> Yeah, we're almost there.

Always something to worry about.<eos> Someone to worry about.<eos> Not another step.<eos> I Will kill you.<eos> What are you?<eos> When this is all over, would you hand Gruenewald over to the Soviet Union?<eos> We were a poor people once, but never again.<eos> This bomb is power, and prosperity.<eos> It will make the world listen.<eos> It'll make the world hate.
Yes, yes, this way.<eos> The Americans call it the calutron, but it's...<eos> It's a particle accelerator.<eos> Separates out uranium 235 and 238, good uranium from bad uranium.<eos> It's very expensive.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Stinking Nazis.<eos> What about the bomb?<eos> What about it?<eos> What if it's in the factory when the B-17s get here?
The brain is swelling, so we need to create more room.<eos> So we remove part of the skull.<eos> And do what with it?<eos> Stomach.<eos> We store the skull bone in the abdomen.<eos> The peritoneum in the belly.<eos> Actually nourishes the skull bone.<eos> It keeps it healthy while he recovers.<eos> And the operation...<eos> is it risky?
- We have one week.<eos> - To accomplish what exactly?<eos> To force Tusk's hand.<eos> He wants me beholden to him?<eos> No.<eos> We have to make him come crawling to me.<eos> What's his weakness?<eos> His fortune.<eos> Wouldn't you say that's his strength?<eos> Not if it's slipping away.
HOW WILL I KNOW WHEN TO STOP?<eos> THE DRILL WILL STOP AUTOMATICALLY.<eos> OKAY, YOU SEE THE TIP? YOU SEE THAT?<eos> PUSH IT IN.<eos> NOW, WHEN THAT RELEASES, THE DRILL STOPS AUTOMATICALLY.<eos> NOW, LOOK AT ME.<eos> YOU NEED TO START RIGHT HERE.<eos> OKAY?<eos> STEADY.<eos> PROMISE ME IT WILL STOP.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system.<eos> A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything.
Forever.<eos> Without ever repeating.<eos> Which means that contained within this string of decimals is every single other number.<eos> Your birthdate, combination to your locker, your Social Security number. It's all in there somewhere.<eos> And if you convert these decimals into letters you would have every word that ever existed in every possible combination.<eos> The first syllable you spoke as a baby. The name of your latest crush.<eos> Your entire life story from beginning to end.<eos> Everything we ever say or do.<eos> All of the world's infinite possibilities rest within this one simple circle.<eos> Now, what you do with that information what it's good for that would be up to you.
Taking advantage of you?<eos> I just...<eos> I can't seem to make life on the outside work.<eos> I didn't know it was gonna be this hard.<eos> Martin, what did Daryl promise you so you would confess to killing Quinlan?<eos> He said he'd take care of Brandy and Joey for the rest of their lives.<eos> They never have to worry about money again.<eos> That's more than I can ever give them.<eos> Well, I don't think they'd agree.<eos> Lab tested your high school ring, and it came back positive for your son's DNA.
- Well, there must be some reason.<eos> Just the oddity of human behavior.<eos> What do you mean, the oddity?<eos> What do I mean?<eos> Yes, Ms. Tascioni? She was pregnant.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> ICSH is the male equivalent of LH.<eos> Luteinizing hormone, a pregnancy-related hormone.<eos> Ms. Tascioni... That's why the unexplained hormonal surge.<eos> It wasn't drug use.
Your Honor, if we're sinking to this level of ludicrousity...<eos> - "Ludicrousity"?<eos> - Braddock University leases the garage from Illinois Trust, and is thus entrusted to patrol it.<eos> Not the second and third floor.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I don't know how I know half the things I know.<eos> Mrs. Florrick?<eos> Yes, Your Honor.<eos> The university does not lease the second and third floors.<eos> It only leases the...
Yeah.<eos> Um, about that, you're not buying it, are you?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Just...<eos> It's just, when I started to lean on you, you weren't there.<eos> I didn't see how I could trust whether you'd be there or not.<eos> But turns out that I can trust that you will do the right thing.<eos> So where does that leave us?<eos> The thing is, it turns out you can't control your heart.<eos> Damn thing just does what it wants.
You already know the answer.<eos> The drake.<eos> I...<eos> I found peter kramer's journal.<eos> Some of it's in a code.<eos> Can you read it?<eos> Of course.<eos> I developed the code.<eos> This... this phrase right here, They use it over and over again.<eos> What does it say?
Yeah.<eos> Guess I could have put your eye out with that.<eos> That would've been awful.<eos> Except eye patches are so cool.<eos> You could totally rock an eye patch, Gibbs.<eos> And that's not important.<eos> So, Ducky's observations were spot-on.<eos> This was definitely a quick, deep jab.<eos> The murderer stuck the weapon in and pulled it right out.<eos> The wound is just over an inch wide, and it's three inches in depth. It was so deep that the fragments were absorbed by the flesh.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system.<eos> A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything.

What?<eos> Right now?<eos> The baby's future depends on the name in that envelope, okay?<eos> And I have to find out so that I can at least try to make it work.<eos> Okay, but what about our weekend?<eos> Well, I'll just go and bring the envelope back and open it...<eos> - With my closest friends.<eos> - Savi...<eos> Hey, just tell me where the envelope is.<eos> Uh, it should be in my nightstand.
It's on the cart.<eos> I have no idea.<eos> I haven't tested it yet.<eos> All right, test it on me.<eos> Right now.<eos> In no universe is that happening.<eos> It's not a request, Ruben.<eos> Just give me the drug.<eos> No way.<eos> There's no way of knowing what it will do to you.
You really think that I could actually be seeing my mother?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Bones, you okay?<eos> I just want to sleep for a little while.<eos> Okay.<eos> Just...<eos> So that's an ice bullet?<eos> I've run into a myriad of problems using a traditional brass jacket and gunpowder.<eos> How many is a "myriad" of problems?<eos> One: the heat generated by the ignition of the gunpowder melts the ice bullet before it can leave the barrel.

Corals have existed for 400 million years.<eos> Like most deep-sea marine creatures, corals are filter feeders, which means that they get their nourishment through micro-plankton which contains nutrients as well as trace elements which the coral absorbs by filtering them through the ocean current.<eos> The corals are endangered in many parts of the world, and yet they only have two real enemies.<eos> Global warming, which influences the algal growth and as a result, algae can then produce toxic substances that are harmful to corals, and humans who break them when they are industrial fishing or even only diving on vacation.<eos> A coral typically takes hundreds of years to fully grow, which is why we should be careful whenever we pay them a visit.<eos> This will ensure that not only we, but the generations that come after us, can fully enjoy the wonderful play of colours and the exciting hustle and bustle that corals play host to.<eos> Encountering a ray is a terrific experience.<eos> Nothing compares to the graceful and weightless swimming of this marvellous fish.<eos> The ray has its mouth on its underside and it loves to search through the sand looking for food.<eos> When a ray swims through the reef it almost looks like it is flying.
In fact, the lion-fish originally came from the waters of the Pacific Ocean, between Malaysia and Japan, its habitat being lagoons and outer reefs.<eos> Since the end of the 20th century, the lion-fish has been sighted in the west part of the North Atlantic Ocean, from the coast of Florida up to North Carolina.<eos> Set free by aquarists, the lion-fish now has no natural enemies and breeds too strongly and too fast.<eos> Often, and without meaning to, humans interfere with ecosystems they do not completely understand and misfortunes are bound to occur, and sadly things might never go back to their natural order.<eos> Watching manta rays as they swim is an extraordinary experience.<eos> Often they appear in pods, which is the term for when several fish swim together, and they like to visit cleaning stations.<eos> Including the tail, manta rays can range from 16 to 29 feet long.<eos> Their wide heads have slightly movable and rounded fins on both sides.<eos> These fins help them to direct plankton into their mouths.<eos> And there is no need to be afraid of their long tail, because it never carries a poisonous sting.

Hey, hey, hey!<eos> Whoa-ho-ho!<eos> Come on, please, stop.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Thanks for stopping.<eos> No one else passed by all day.<eos> 'Cause hardly no one uses this route no more.<eos> How'd you all get out here?<eos> Ah, we're businessmen.<eos> Our car, it broke down about 20 Miles away from here.
You've been lied to and set up.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> How've I been set up?<eos> 18th at noon, 20th same time, it was Mia's lunch break.<eos> She was with me.<eos> Twilite motel.<eos> Call the manager.<eos> Look at the guest book.<eos> Someone set you up.<eos> If they toss me out before I had a chance to headline, my solo career is over before it starts.
Marcus, listen, friends are gathering.<eos> A patriotic force will depose President Bolton at a joint session of Congress today.<eos> - Now what we need from you is--<eos> - Arthur, you know that I've had nothing but tricks and traps thrown at me.<eos> How do I know there's not a gun to your head right now?<eos> Well, you don't have to trust me.<eos> Just watch.<eos> Now certain facts have recently come to light, like what really happened in Pakistan and to your boat.<eos> The truth is coming out.<eos> And once it does, it'll be time to bring you home.
Women reach their sexual peak at whatever age Jan was last week.<eos> I mean, it was...<eos> like making love with a wild animal.<eos> But not like a cougar like you might think.<eos> It was, uh... like a swarm of bees.<eos> Bees that just find something wrong with every hotel room.<eos> Nothing wrong with being a gentleman.<eos> Like my mom used to say, "talk classy, act nasty."<eos> What's with the wig, Meredith?<eos> What, is it on backwards?
!<eos> Excuse me, I...<eos> Viola, I have to explain something very difficult to you, and you will be upset when I tell you, but I will help you.<eos> And that's the most important thing to understand.<eos> Who are you?<eos> We'll get to that.<eos> First, I have to tell you the simple fact.<eos> Grayson's been poisoned.<eos> That's why he isn't feeling well.<eos> By morning, his fever will be spiking, but it won't come down no matter what you do.
- This plane is filled with rats!<eos> - (WHISPERS) Okay.<eos> And we got to kill them all, starting with the queen!<eos> What's the deal with you and Detective Tommy Sullivan?<eos> Am I gonna have to fight a duel with that guy every time I want to ask you out, or what?<eos> (LAUGHS) Well, I would pay to see that, but I don't think so.<eos> - But there is a story there, huh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> A long one that I'm not telling.<eos> I don't want you to tell it, I just want to know it has an end.
And so are you!<eos> Hey, lady, lay off my grandma.<eos> Lay off?<eos> Y-you need to lay off crap like this!<eos> This will give you another heart attack!<eos> And if I can't get that through your head, I will take it up with child services.<eos> In fact, that's the best idea I've had all day.<eos> The ethical thing would have been for my client's mother to be told that her body parts, upon her death, would be used to derive revenue for the hospital, whether or not they saved lives.<eos> The honest thing would be to tell people that even while there's a ban on organ sales in this country, there's nothing to stop the hospitals from selling tissues and parts to other countries, which they routinely do.<eos> Your honor, this practice is not nearly as transparent as it needs to be, which can only cause people to distrust the program and result in fewer organ donations being made.
That will do for now.<eos> In any event, a noble lady stands only on rare occasions.<eos> Then how do I move to pick something up?<eos> In that case thus! One proceeds on one's knees, and always gracefully.<eos> Be graceful at all times...<eos> Your Highness!<eos> Beautiful, is it not?<eos> Unroll it like this, and the story flows out in the pictures.<eos> Yeah!<eos> It really flows!
A journey?<eos> They won't be back for ten years.<eos> Ten years?<eos> Use up all the trees and you kill the mountain.<eos> Leave its power and go away, and it revives.<eos> Give the trees ten years, and you can work them again.<eos> Charcoal's like that, too.<eos> But what if the mountain really is dead?<eos> The leaves were so beautiful...<eos> It's not dead.
Annie, don't listen to him.<eos> You know you can't make Valedictorian with an "F", and you can eliminate your competition in one easy step.<eos> What else do you have to lose, my dear?<eos> I mean, these people, they're not here to support you.<eos> I mean, they already hate you for this disaster of a party.<eos> Not this guy.<eos> No.<eos> I can't. Give it up, professor.<eos> You've fired all your bullets.<eos> No, I've got one more bullet left, and it's a doozy.
I just felt like I owed her one after we both bailed on your dinner the other night.<eos> Oh, my God, why won't you just admit that you like her and that I am an awesome matchmaker?<eos> I'll admit that you're an awesome nanny.<eos> You'll have to settle for that.<eos> We'll revisit this after the date.<eos> Oh, by the way, the TV remote has been missing since yesterday.<eos> I think somebody hid it, but I can't get anything out of him.<eos> Harrison, did you take the TV remote?<eos> No.<eos> - Do you know where it is?
I'm not gonna hurt you... Mom.<eos> Trust me, if I wanted you dead, I wouldn't be holding this door.<eos> Do you recognize this from the video I sent you?<eos> This is where you kill your victims.<eos> Why did you bring me here?<eos> To help you understand.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Don't worry, I wiped it down after every, uh...<eos> This room is more than what you think it is.<eos> It's a reminder.
Good day.<eos> Cullen.<eos> It's been a long winter, son.<eos> Stretch out on your bunk.<eos> Get some sleep.<eos> Go away, doc.<eos> You a... you ain't real.<eos> You ain't real.<eos> Your candle is burning low, Cullen.<eos> Soon it's gonna go out.
- I got you a parka.<eos> Those two are never on the same page.<eos> Wait for the look...<eos> And that's why it works.<eos> Donna, don't go!<eos> It's not too late.<eos> We can still start our family.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> You already have a family.<eos> It's right there.
I was so happy until I read your play, Stewie.<eos> I finally had some kind of success as a writer.<eos> It wasn't big, but it was mine.<eos> I was fine being an okay writer, until I discovered I was living in a house with a brilliant one.<eos> I know we don't talk about doggy years a lot, but I-I just wish you could have waited to find out how talented you were until I was gone.<eos> By the time I'm dead, you won't even be ten.<eos> You'll have 70 more years to be great.<eos> I just wish I could have had five to be good.<eos> There's your voice, Brian.<eos> It's a depressing voice, but it's yours.
Either the door was open or he unlocked it.<eos> What is this?<eos> Is that cast-off spray from the throat cut?<eos> Why is it so far from the body?<eos> Must have been a wide slash, more of a swing.<eos> I wonder why he came up here.<eos> Look at this.<eos> You see the blood on the outside of the statue?<eos> There's nothing on the inside.<eos> Meaning the blood hit the statue before it broke.
Don't give me this story about your dead uncle, because Gabe checked, and there is no lawyer named Badger.<eos> So you can stop that right now.<eos> I'm not expecting everything at once, okay?<eos> Now, let me see the watch.<eos> [Chuckling] No, dummy, the pocket watch.<eos> The one you keep rubbing every time you get nervous.<eos> Yeah, now, here's something.<eos> I mean, you give me this, this buys you time.<eos> I saw a watch like this on ebay for five grand.<eos> It was my father's.
- That's enough!<eos> Sweetheart.<eos> Just forget I said anything.<eos> You don't have to say a word.<eos> It's gonna be enough for me just to look over and see your face... the one person who's never turned his back on me in this world.<eos> Yeah, I gotta go.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> Yeah, fine.<eos> I just wanted to let you know I'm selling that limo off to a scrapyard.<eos> It'll be off the curb by end of shift.
Yeah.<eos> It's their way of, uh, showing dominance.<eos> That's... cool.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I thought so.<eos> Ooh.<eos> I have the, uh, rental van on traffic cam footage from yesterday an hour after the shooting, turning east on Saticoy, 1400 block.<eos> That's about half a mile from the restaurant.<eos> Checking the first Saticoy cam and one on another street due west.<eos> If the van came out, it would have had to pass by one of them.

Do you have any idea how hard it is to get a job right now?<eos> Not my problem.<eos> Well, it's not my problem, either, so I'll just call my boss, and then he can call the cops, and they can figure it out, 'cause I am not gonna get...<eos> Okay, okay, okay, okay.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Enjoy your pie.<eos> You're going to throw away a pizza?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you know how much I have dreamed about American pizza since I left?<eos> It's all yours.
Okay.<eos> Good?<eos> Got it.<eos> We're good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You ever see the movie Malcolm X?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's an amazing film.<eos> His story is what inspired her.<eos> But then they twisted his message into something that... made her life more hopeless than it ever was.
- We are.<eos> We're just, uh, giving you a head start.<eos> I wish my mom was here.<eos> We could all hang out in her shadow.<eos> Wool pants in the desert.<eos> I feel like I've got poached testicles.<eos> Oh, you poor thing, you're sweating.<eos> That's so much worse than having your car stolen.<eos> Insurance is gonna buy you a new car.<eos> It's not gonna de-funk my junk.
Well, here I am.<eos> And I see your glass is half empty.<eos> Half full.<eos> I'm an optimist.<eos> Even so, let me give you a fresh one.<eos> We can't risk you getting thirsty.<eos> Ah!<eos> Oh, I am so sorry.<eos> I just bought this tux.<eos> Then we have to take care of that stain before it sets.
We have to regroup.<eos> Therefore, I'm instituting a hiring freeze, which you would have known about had you come and asked my permission first.<eos> Okay, you can't do this.<eos> I'm a senior partner, and that's the rule.<eos> Strictly speaking, it's not a rule, it's a tradition.<eos> I get it.<eos> Strictly speaking, this isn't about a hiring freeze, this is punishment.<eos> You can be punitive, I can be punitive.<eos> The offer already went out, Jessica.<eos> You're a lawyer, make it go away.
You think you're the only one who knows where Judge Benjamin plays?<eos> No.<eos> But I'm the only one here he plays with.<eos> Now, did you come here to caddie for me?<eos> I came here to negotiate.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> Your client caved after that deposition, because she knew she couldn't make it through a trial.<eos> So I'm gonna negotiate for you.<eos> The offer on the table was 2 million.<eos> It just went down to one.
Almost cut her head clean off.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> !<eos> You stupid, crazy bitch, what are you doing? !<eos> I'm not doing anything. God, Bullet.<eos> I wasn't gonna jump. Okay?<eos> I just wanted to look at the water.<eos> Come here. Come here.<eos> Look at it.<eos> Before the boats and garbage and people and stuff mess it up, it's so smooth and clean, you know?
No doubt.<eos> He'll do it.<eos> He'll do it. Just let me do the talking.<eos> Heading in.<eos> - What's that?<eos> You jack that ring, too?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Lyric was telling me about this blue ring her grandmother used to have.<eos> She would always try to steal it, but...<eos> I figure, it's blue.
Is it because you think I'm not that?<eos> No, Sue.<eos> I just...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I didn't want you to feel like you had to live up to something I did.<eos> I wanted you to live your own life and not have this idea that you had to be like me.<eos> And honestly, I know at your age all this stuff may seem important, but it's not.<eos> It's like this dress.<eos> It was such a big deal when I got it, and now look.<eos> It's hanging in the back of Aunt Edie's closet, collecting dust.
I've got enough friends.<eos> Happy New Year, Joyce.<eos> So what's the plan, Haley?<eos> I'm going in.<eos> That's our baby brother up there.<eos> I'm not ready for all of this.<eos> The girls, the hormones-- it's gross.<eos> Well, we can't just barge in.<eos> I'm still trying to get the image of mom and dad out of my...<eos> Oh, God, it's back.
I like to win too.<eos> Max's Homemade Cupcakes.<eos> Hello?<eos> Bad cell area.<eos> Max, I think that might've been Dottie, the B.S. Bride.<eos> I couldn't hear the words, but she sounded unnaturally confident.<eos> Maybe the B.S. stands for "big sale."<eos> No more business calls, okay?<eos> I thought we were getting away for fun.<eos> We are, but our business is nowhere near where we need it to be, and when it comes to ignoring a call, it's kind of hard.
All right, listen up, everyone.<eos> Let's try real hard not to get Abby's cold, okay?<eos> You're the one who's gonna kiss her and get us all sick.<eos> That's because I'm the one who has to take care of everyone.<eos> I'm this family's Nurse Jackie.<eos> You're this family's secret drug addict?<eos> Okay, clearly, I've never seen "Nurse Jackie."<eos> Yeah, she's a drug addict.<eos> (Knock on door)<eos> We've been told that there's a contagion in your house, and we've come to ensure it doesn't spread to the community.
What is it?<eos> Uh, looks like a shotgun pellet.<eos> Yeah, we found some of those under the bones.<eos> Figured they fell out the body as they decomposed.<eos> No shell casings in here, though.<eos> Must have shot them somewhere else, brought the bodies here.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Yeah, a couple of things.<eos> High school class ring.<eos> Guess it fell off one of them.
All this for a muddy cop car and a dead pig?<eos> It's Wilden.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> "You're mine now."<eos> I know what the text meant.<eos> "A" has a way to make it look like we killed him.<eos> ♪ oh ♪ If Red Coat's "A," why did she save us from the fire?<eos> So she could set us up to take the fall for Wilden's murder.<eos> Yeah, a cat plays with a mouse for hours before she actually eats it.<eos> Once it's dead, the fun's over.
If you liked her, why don't you answer "Don't Answer"?<eos> I'll see her, we'll have fun, we'll go out, then we'll fight.<eos> Someone gets hurt, we break up.<eos> Sounds great.<eos> Honestly, it's better to be free and have fun.<eos> Thanks to people like you, you don't need a partner.<eos> I taught you many things, but not to think like that.<eos> You know what I miss most about Adrien?<eos> My era.<eos> It left with him.
They're amazing.<eos> I mean, listen to them.<eos> That's what I want us to be doing in a few years.<eos> Hey, why do I get the feeling you're trying to tell me something?<eos> A few more years you want to be big-time in Lafayette?<eos> BeauSoleil is big-time everywhere.<eos> To you. But in case you haven't noticed, it is getting harder and harder to survive on the margins in this industry.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Look, the album did what it did.<eos> This touring's doing what it can.
- Why not?<eos> Listen.<eos> Shorty, right?<eos> Tracks off a yet-to-be-released album.<eos> Damn.<eos> My mind is gone.<eos> Just gone.<eos> Looks like there is no footage from Washington and Carondelet.<eos> That camera's been inoperable for some time.<eos> So it's there for what reason?
I was wondering about his name.<eos> He's not short no more.<eos> You see my point?<eos> I do not. I confess.<eos> Look, he is who he is because he comes from where he comes from.<eos> Not some music conservatory, performance art center.<eos> None of that shit.<eos> He comes from the street.<eos> From the second lines, from the funerals, and later, those shithole three-sets-a-night clubs.<eos> The music lives where it lives, brah.
- I like him.<eos> I can't help it.<eos> And he lives in the Treme.<eos> A few blocks from the park and the auditorium.<eos> Connected to all kinds of people we'll need on our side.<eos> I have a small record label, Mercury Monterey. The label is very selective in terms of the amount of artists that we handle.<eos> Very conservative in our approach.<eos> The industry is evolving, but we're cautiously optimistic.<eos> Is there much profit remaining in the record business?<eos> It's in a transitional period.
Now, are you here to say that you want us to be a family again under one roof?<eos> Because if you are, I'll listen.<eos> Tell them that I stopped by.<eos> And so we remember Cherise and Deron and the other students in this city who are victims of violence this year.<eos> We're here to grieve and to heal.<eos> - Yes. And also to start thinking very seriously about how we can bring about change.<eos> - Yes. - Jennifer.<eos> Cherise was my friend.<eos> She was a kind person and loving to her little brother.<eos> We love this city, but it needs to love us back.
- No, I'll be okay.<eos> - And... - It's on the first floor.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Reception, hello? - Oh, no.<eos> Sorry!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sir?<eos> Sir?<eos> Excuse me, have you come across my wedding ring?<eos> No, what did it look like?
Sorry!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sir?<eos> Sir?<eos> Excuse me, have you come across my wedding ring?<eos> No, what did it look like?<eos> - Which room?<eos> - Room number 4.<eos> I left it by the sink.<eos> It must have fallen down the pipe.
Come on, Birkhoff, it's just four missions the President wants us to look into.<eos> Yeah, then it's five, then six.<eos> Look, you go down to Ops and tell all them that instead of shutting this place down and earning their freedom, they're just gonna have to shine it on a little bit longer for Uncle Sam.<eos> That's why we are going to take on the risk ourselves, without involving the rest of Division.<eos> Speak for yourself, sister.<eos> Birkhoff, suck up.<eos> These are not Percy's side jobs.<eos> These are not illegal.<eos> Division is illegal.<eos> It always has been.
Hey, quit touching the pig.<eos> It's not a fucking petting zoo.<eos> Ma'am, this is a matter of security, okay?<eos> You think this pig is gonna attack her?<eos> Son, that fucker is skinned and roasted.<eos> He's at a huge disadvantage.<eos> Okay, look, Office of the President.<eos> So I'm staying.<eos> I don't care if there is a funeral procession due to use that street.<eos> It is to be closed by 4:00 today.
He'll open in 5 minutes.<eos> How the hell can prosecutor Roswall mix up megabit and megabyte?<eos> Generally speaking, for storage you use byte and when you measure speed you use bit.<eos> It all started with Gottfrid's site "America's Dumbest Soldiers".<eos> It was a site where you could rate from 1 to 10.<eos> It was American soldiers who died in the first Iraq war.<eos> Then you could rate how stupid they were depending on how silly their deaths were.<eos> Neither the American government nor anybody else appreciated the site.<eos> I had a spare line which I let him use for the site.<eos> It was from British Telecom.
OK, pals! Action!<eos> NATO shmato!<eos> Arthur, keep this lunch short and sweet.<eos> We leave at 1:30 PM latest.<eos> Sir...<eos> Your cards for Molly Hutchinson!<eos> Mr. Minister...<eos> I prepared you a NATO card. Read it in the meeting.<eos> I can't read that.<eos> It's rumpled. Like out of a swimming pool.
That matters, and today one can see it clearly.<eos> After 3000 years of civilization, we face the most troubled period in human history.<eos> Mankind is about to destroy Mankind.<eos> Nuclear crises, fratricidal wars...<eos> And what do those hacks brazenly do?<eos> Those wart hogs?<eos> I'll tell you, Molly, they write index cards:<eos> dream up talking points.<eos> They flitter around, chat, listen, indulge themselves, while war rages.<eos> It's raging in the Middle East, in Africa, soon it may rage in Lusdemistan.

It takes the edge off the caffeine.<eos> And you... look a little thin.<eos> Thin is in.<eos> Drinking, for you, is not.<eos> I wasn't drinking.<eos> I had some drinks.<eos> So, the reading of the will didn't go as you expected?<eos> Daddy left me the team, not the cosmetics company, not the airline... not even a record label.<eos> The team.<eos> It's worth a billion dollars.
A playful sorceress.<eos> She invented this great game where she would disappear into thin air.<eos> And the moment that Opus and I began to get nervous, she would reappear! (Laughs)<eos> It was a miracle.<eos> It was peek-a-boo.<eos> It was pure magic.<eos> I'm trying to help you here, Noah.<eos> You're a married man.<eos> My body may be married.<eos> But my soul... it runs free, (Noah) through the night, into the thicket, where warm Carmen awaits, in the damp, salty night air.
What you have figured out on your own-- cross-species DNA sequencing-- that took our people years.<eos> You would be an asset to our organization.<eos> You make it sound like I have a choice.<eos> Of course you have a choice.<eos> You think we want people working for us who don't believe in our cause?<eos> What cause?<eos> To cover up this creature you've created?<eos> Dr. Marks, you obviously got into this line of work to put away monsters.<eos> This creature is dangerous.<eos> It needs to be contained.
Don't do it for me.<eos> You should do what feels right.<eos> My marriage doesn't feel right.<eos> Neither does an award for leadership or integrity.<eos> You know, Clinton was one of my favorite presidents.<eos> You are so not helping.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Tess and Heather gave me an ultimatum-- you or them.<eos> Catherine, the photograph...<eos> I got it, and if she notices it's missing, I'll just tell her that I wanted it.
Okay, so let's just take care of that.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> You got a minute?<eos> Um, uh, yeah, sure.<eos> I saw you posted those pictures online.<eos> Yeah, people might want copies.<eos> I looked for the flash drive everywhere.<eos> I couldn't find it.<eos> Because it's in my bag.
And your car crash.<eos> I saw someone, some thing pull you out of that wreckage.<eos> Okay, I... I want to talk about this, I do, but it's not a good time.<eos> Look, I just...<eos> Look, just tell me why you won't pursue it.<eos> Because I'm not a scientist.<eos> No.<eos> You're a homicide detective, and this thing kills people.<eos> Criminals.<eos> It kills criminals.
Ok.<eos> I trust you.<eos> Bye dad.<eos> - See you later.<eos> - Kisses.<eos> - Shit, it wasn't her.<eos> - Wait.<eos> Nothing proves that your gun killed Véronique Parant.<eos> - Did you put it elsewhere?<eos> - No, it was there.
Isa, it's shit when you don't answer.<eos> I wanted to see the end of the film.<eos> That's not bad.<eos> Have you got something to tell me?<eos> How are you?<eos> - Very well.<eos> You?<eos> - Yeah...<eos> What about the shop?<eos> It's good, yeah.
- Well...<eos> - Please.<eos> Arthur, wait.<eos> No way.<eos> Are you there?<eos> - What do you need to know?<eos> Yes.<eos> Go downstairs in 5 mins.<eos> A car will pick you up.<eos> It won't wait.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system.<eos> A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything.
- We're married?<eos> - D-- uh, dating.<eos> - For how long?<eos> - Three years.<eos> We're not married yet?<eos> Can't we just have one fake conversation without you talking about marriage all the time?<eos> Hey, Brad.<eos> Hey, Penny.<eos> - I love that shirt, Brad.<eos> - Where's it from?
Thanks.<eos> Can I copy you like I do in math class?<eos> Real news isn't about copying.<eos> And you shouldn't copy me in math.<eos> Yeah, well, you should get a tutor, 'cause I got a "C."<eos> You got a "C"?<eos> Wait, I got a "D."<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll do my own story.<eos> And it'll be way better than yours, you lame-pon.
- Got that right.<eos> What are you?<eos> Who made you God?<eos> You ask me such questions?<eos> Ridiculous.<eos> I am the knowledge and strength of 10,000 worlds.<eos> I am flesh and machine.<eos> I am becoming everything.<eos> And you, your arrival is no more than a rare opportunity for entertainment.<eos> And it presents me the opportunity to correct that error.
Look, please...<eos> "Please"? "Please"?<eos> I'm gonna shoot you in the fucking head, mate.<eos> I'm gonna count to three.<eos> One...<eos> Don't.<eos> Two...<eos> Did the bullet come out the front?<eos> Did the bullet come out the front of his head?<eos> No... No, it didn't.
Right.<eos> OK.<eos> If you can't help us, we need to go.<eos> Look, I can't do this on my own.<eos> This has one number on it - mine.<eos> Why come this way around?<eos> You can hold it if you like.<eos> What if they give this room out?<eos> They won't.<eos> It's occupied.
Yes, we are.<eos> Great.<eos> The human memory is far more capable than most people realize.<eos> I've been in this room once before.<eos> But when I was in here... I paid attention.<eos> Very close attention.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Please. But that's just memory 101.<eos> Let's move forward into the advanced coursework.<eos> For memory to be useful, it has to be as accurate and as fast as a camera.
There's about 30 descendants of Ernst Vogelsong, and every one of them seems to be contesting a part of the will or accusing the others of some improper financial behavior.<eos> Uh, did you find out what was going on between Elise Vogelsong and her nephew?<eos> It was about a codicil giving Curtis Wiley another chunk of inheritance and a seat on the foundation board.<eos> There's pages of claims and counter claims centered on whether it took effect at 35 or 40.<eos> Seriously?<eos> These people are a law firm's dream.<eos> No kidding.<eos> And more recently, Curtis had been making claims of managerial incompetence.<eos> Said that there were accounting irregularities at the foundation and the soldiers' home.<eos> Any idea the status of the case, which way it was leaning?
In the galley.<eos> And give her this.<eos> God knows she'll need it.<eos> Why have we stopped?<eos> We must make sure the castle isn't taken.<eos> Wait here.<eos> Hup!<eos> Hup!<eos> This is too much, Elizabeth.<eos> Once the magic is out, you cannot call it back, and it may turn round and drown us too.
You're here.<eos> Well, I was always here.<eos> ♪ For once ♪<eos> ♪ There is nothing up my sleeve ♪<eos> ♪ Just some scars ♪<eos> ♪ From a life that used to trouble me ♪<eos> ♪ I used to run ♪<eos> ♪ At first sight of the sun ♪<eos> ♪ Now I lay here waiting ♪ ♪ For you to wake up ♪<eos> ♪ The city outside ♪ ♪ Still sounds like it's on fire ♪
Mary Margaret!<eos> Are you okay? !<eos> Are you...<eos> What did you do?<eos> You were right.<eos> This isn't me.<eos> You two, out of the way.<eos> A vision told me about you.<eos> Told me this day would come.<eos> But it didn't tell me everything. Didn't tell me what I really wanted to know.
I've been grinning like a school girl ever since he asked me.<eos> It's ridiculous at my age, I know.<eos> How involved are you in his business dealings?<eos> Oh, very.<eos> We're a partnership.<eos> I'm very excited about the Holy Spring.<eos> You see, the pool might be in the convent, but I own the land where the spring finds its source.<eos> You own the land?<eos> Yes, it was left to me many years ago.<eos> Well, we thought it was worthless but then a nun gets cured, and then others.
They obviously haven't got a clue what's going on.<eos> No cabbie is gonna stop if you blow a whistle at them.<eos> Cabs have been hailed this way for decades because this is the most efficient way to hail a cab.<eos> The murder of Todd Clarke makes me more certain than ever that someone is killing anyone with knowledge of the Red Team's plans.<eos> I'm just not certain it's Army Intelligence anymore.<eos> Who else knew the names of the Red Team?<eos> See?<eos> Not stopping.<eos> The list could have worked its way up the chain of command.<eos> It could have leaked to another agency.
He's always with me.<eos> Can I look at your chest?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Nothing?<eos> How did it get in there?<eos> Maybe he picked the bullet up as a toddler on the playground and breathed it in.<eos> No, a toddler's bronchi are really small.<eos> It should have gotten caught in the left main-stem, caused all sorts of problems.<eos> It's also in the wrong place to have been aspirated.<eos> Unless it migrated.

Actually, I chucked it at him to get him off my windowsill 'cause he was staring at me, and then he took it.<eos> So I chased after him and I cornered him against this tree.<eos> And it was by the lake that's only sometimes a lake, but then it dries up.<eos> But right now it's a lake again.<eos> - You know?<eos> - You can't just buy another toothbrush?<eos> What?<eos> Squirrels have rabies.<eos> A toothbrush costs $3.<eos> - It was pink.

Peter, what... Why are you dressed like that?<eos> What did you do to your hair?<eos> Business trip, Lois.<eos> Going to Chicago City.<eos> I see.<eos> And in case you're wondering why I don't have business charts, yes, I do.<eos> All right, I got to say good-bye to the kids.<eos> Hey, champ.<eos> I want you to have this pocket watch.<eos> It still works, even though it's got a lot of Civil War brains all over it.
No. It's not offensive.<eos> - So let's do it.<eos> - You first.<eos> So clearly, this is not offensive.<eos> It is offensive.<eos> - I am very sorry.<eos> - Take it off.<eos> Hey, Wyatt.<eos> Oh, hey, Shauna.<eos> So I was chasing this story, but it seems like a dead end.
Okay. $7.50.<eos> Oh, honey-sweetie-baby.<eos> It's the ring, Robin.<eos> The ring has power.<eos> When a woman puts on an engagement ring, it's like when bilbo baggins wears the one ring in the hobbit.<eos> Okay, can you say that again but not in nerd?<eos> Sure.<eos> Uh, the ring is like the cloak that Harry Potter wears to sneak around Hogwarts.<eos> Yeah, I don't speak virgin either.<eos> The ring... it makes you invisible.
Shouldn't we be pillaging his shop or ransacking his home?<eos> That would be the obvious choice, yes, but Gold wouldn't risk crossing the town line and losing his memory<eos> - without entrusting the dagger's location to someone.<eos> - Belle.<eos> My guess is she hid it in one of her beloved books.<eos> Impressive, Regina.<eos> Thank you, mother.<eos> I'll be impressed when I'm holding the dagger in my hand.<eos> No.<eos> It should be here.
I made the "right" decision when I let my own mother die from Cora's poison.<eos> And we keep beating them.<eos> At what cost?<eos> All I want is our happy ending.<eos> It's time.<eos> We've earned it.<eos> No more lives lost.<eos> No more hearts broken.<eos> The dagger...<eos> It's useless until Gold returns to Storybrooke.
If the DEA intercepts the submarine, they cut the torpedo loose.<eos> So, what, it's just sitting at the bottom of the ocean?<eos> The cartel will retrieve it once the coast is clear.<eos> So why were you so pissed?<eos> My show of anger got them to discount 15%.<eos> Business, Mike.<eos> Always business.<eos> I'm surprised they'd be so careless.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, I mean, a fishing boat could snag it, the feds could find it, or it could just disappear.
'Then the York line will be ended... for ever.'<eos> When Charles said we could swell an army from his prisons, I hoped it would be a better crop than this!<eos> We'll make it work, Henry.<eos> Right?<eos> The French have sided with Tudor.<eos> They have given him an army.<eos> It is not over.<eos> I must make ready.<eos> That silk is beautiful.<eos> It would suit our niece, Elizabeth.
For me?<eos> Not quite so beastly now, am I?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Maybe now I can actually get some sleep.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> It's not to help you sleep, dearie.<eos> It's to muffle the cries so I can get back to work!<eos> Are you sure you wanna do this, dearie?<eos> Pretty sure.<eos> If you don't know how to use that wand, it can do nasty things to you.
Our children make their own decisions, Marco.<eos> You can't blame yourself for anything that's happened.<eos> Yes, I can.<eos> And you should blame me, too.<eos> The wardrobe I built for you.<eos> The one that transported Emma to this world-- she did not go alone.<eos> Of course she did.<eos> The wardrobe only had enough magic to transport one person.<eos> No, that was a lie I made the blue fairy tell you.<eos> It had enough magic to transport two,

it came to the window, only it's not attached to a body.<eos> And it can do so many wonderful things like...<eos> Like change its shape and fly and travel between worlds.<eos> And do you know why?<eos> Because it has magic.<eos> Whatever you do, promise me you'll never open that window again.<eos> Promise me you won't talk to the shadow.<eos> Don't be silly.<eos> Magic is dangerous.<eos> It always comes with a price.
See, after I left Storybrooke as a boy,<eos> I was babbling about magic, about what I had seen, and what had happened to my father.<eos> You know, most folks, they...<eos> they wrote me off.<eos> But some didn't.<eos> And they found me.<eos> "They"?<eos> Believers.<eos> People that know that magic is real.<eos> And that it doesn't belong in this world and are willing to do something about it.
He's coming your way.<eos> Greg Mendell.<eos> So I was right.<eos> It wasn't Tamara.<eos> Actually...<eos> It was.<eos> I just had some help.<eos> What are you doing, Tamara?<eos> I have to keep magic out of this world, Neal.<eos> It doesn't belong here.
What do you want?<eos> My organization has been contracted to eliminate a certain high profile individual.<eos> A very well-guarded target.<eos> Well, forget it.<eos> Look, I'm retired.<eos> To drink and smoke your life away?<eos> We all got to die some time.<eos> I need someone to die at the right time.<eos> And no one does it better than you.<eos> My vision... ain't exactly what it used to be.
A suicidal woman carefully replaces a damaged pot before lowering herself silently into the water?<eos> No.<eos> The tea.<eos> The tea has to hold the key.<eos> If it didn't poison her, why prepare it and only drink half a cup?<eos> She was disturbed.<eos> By her killer.<eos> Carlton Reynolds was the last person to see her.<eos> Have you got Dr Jones' new statement?<eos> Yes, it's here.
There is a procedure to treat epilepsy that involves surgically severing the connection between the left and right brain.<eos> The goal is to block signals that cause seizures.<eos> A packet?<eos> We're gonna convince these people to give us $175 million with a packet?<eos> It's a nice packet.
The thing about this car is it's, like, one of those rarities of life.
(Ryan Adams) Â™º Last time I was here you were waiting â™º<eos> (exhales deeply) Â™º you're not waiting anymore<eos> Â™º The window's broken and smoke's escaping â™º â™º a book's scattered across the floor â™º â™º and the church bells ringing through the sirens â™º (grunting) Â™º and your coat was full of bullet holes â™º â™º last time I was here you were waiting â™º â™º you ain't waiting anymore<eos> I was gonna put a coat of wax on the car later.<eos> Have I told you about the circle method?<eos> You start with a tiny circle and...<eos> You have.<eos> You have.<eos> It was...<eos> I have a lot of things, so maybe I could just see your car tomorrow when it's all waxy.
We saw with the sister at the parade.<eos> The sister was her chief of staff.<eos> Maybe a radical political organization, An opponent, a whack job.<eos> It seems to me there's a lot easier ways To kill a State Senator.<eos> No, I was thinking the same thing.<eos> Small staff, no bodyguards.<eos> What did she make, like 60k a year?<eos> $61,132.99.<eos> Okay, I came upstairs to tell you<eos> That the bullet fragmented when it hit the skull.
Who? He just said to watch Beth closely, protect her, make sure she's not aware.<eos> Aware of what?<eos> Of me, of us.<eos> This is high-level shit, Sarah, an illegal human- cloning trial.<eos> Aren't you the least bit worried that someone might be trying to kill you?<eos> Yes.<eos> But at least it's not you.<eos> And I still need to see my daughter.<eos> Take my car.<eos> It's in the underground.
You know what I'm thinking?<eos> I'm thinking, why would a man use a wife's tombstone to kill someone. Why?<eos> You had an affair with Rachel Knox.<eos> I did not admit to that.<eos> Rachel Knox advised you to euthanize your wife.<eos> My wife killed herself.<eos> Our shrink says that she didn't.<eos> I mean, if she did, then... you wouldn't be feeling guilty.<eos> What else did he say?<eos> He says that only a guilty husband would put the special grave marker back exactly where it was.
You're a smart girl.<eos> You like to play the clown, but you've got a lot to offer this world.<eos> This is not a life, Taystee.<eos> Yo, listen to Voodoo Mambo, yo.<eos> Hey, yo, you think you just having...<eos> What they call it?<eos> That thing that happens to animals in captivity where it changes they brains?<eos> I seen it at the Bronx Zoo once.<eos> This giraffe ate its own vomit, banged its head up against the bars.<eos> 'Cause it ain't fit to live in the wild no more.
Almost cut her head clean off.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> ! You stupid, crazy bitch, what are you doing? !<eos> I'm not doing anything. God, Bullet.<eos> I wasn't gonna jump. Okay?<eos> I just wanted to look at the water.<eos> Come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> Look at it.<eos> Before the boats and garbage and people and stuff mess it up, it's so smooth and clean, you know?

Yeah, actually.<eos> That, okay.<eos> Um, we need to talk.<eos> Toothbrush is the first step.<eos> And next, it'll be your clothes.<eos> And then your friends, and then I'm gonna make you get me a ring.<eos> And a dog, because what I really want is a kid, but-- but I don't want to scare you off, so I have to take baby steps.<eos> Seriously, it was an-- an old white-elephant gift.<eos> Did you just, like-- what, y-your old one?<eos> It's right here. It's right here in the drawer.
But his heir is just a boy, not ready to reign.<eos> Elizabeth.<eos> She will try to rule through him as she does through Edward.<eos> This is your divine act!<eos> I'm sure the Queen will fish out some potion to restore his...<eos> I must send word to Brittany.<eos> Henry must stay put for now.<eos> If the King should die...<eos> We should wait until we know who is Lord Protector.<eos> We must be cautious... ..but ready to grasp any opportunity if it comes up.
Yes, I can.<eos> You know that I...<eos> You've had a seeing.<eos> What did you see?<eos> Is it Anthony?<eos> - Richard Grey?<eos> - I'm sorry, Mother. I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> 'My life was lent me to one intent.<eos> 'It is nigh spent.
If he had listened to me, he would be here right now and not out on the road.<eos> Well, Dale loves his job, and Dwayne isn't here, either.<eos> Oh, honey! You can't compare the two.<eos> Anybody can drive a truck.<eos> Well! Must be nice to have yet another child.<eos> Oh, yes, I can't wait to meet our little angel.<eos> Soon, it's gonna be just midnight feedings and all-night crying.<eos> Oh, and don't forget about the baby.<eos> Oh, yeah, it is hard.<eos> And then your life, it changes forever.
Oh, that must have been rough, seeing Michael that way.<eos> Yeah. I'll keep an eye on him.<eos> Who's gonna keep an eye on you, with Roland gone?<eos> I still have Jackie and my friends at the hospital.<eos> And I got Molly to keep me busy.<eos> I'll be all right.<eos> You need anything, I'm on a plane in a heartbeat.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Hey, look where we are-- your old house.<eos> Looking way better than it did when we lived there.
Well, they all sound the same to me.<eos> Yeah, they totally sound the same, right?<eos> Right?<eos> They do sound pretty much the same.<eos> Let's play ball!<eos> All right, verne.<eos> And the hat goes on.<eos> The hat is on.<eos> - And once the hat is on...<eos> - It does not come off.
Cut!<eos> Cut!<eos> Hold on, hold on...<eos> Get that shot! Get that shot!<eos> Get that shot! Get that shot!<eos> That was beautiful.<eos> - We got that scene just now, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That scene was probably the best work I've ever done as a director.<eos> It Just came together, perfectly.
If you'd said you were the insurance agent, I wouldn't have bad to beat you so bad!<eos> You... you didn't say were po... lice.<eos> Hey, look at these.<eos> Look, our victim obviously had relationships with both of these women.<eos> And it's very possible that he wanted to marry one of them.<eos> It's suicide to ask two women to share one diamond.<eos> Good, then we don't need to... pay compensation.<eos> When did the deceased buy insurance?<eos> Not... not more than a week ago.<eos> It became effective on the day he... died.
Let me guess, you became, um, a vomit connoisseur in college?<eos> Baltimore Narcotics, and compared to a smack addict who's just binged on Beltway burgers this is nothing.<eos> Natural ingredients break down faster.<eos> I only eat organic.<eos> Well, that's about to change.<eos> Along with a few other aspects of your ironic hipster lifestyle.<eos> So what do you say, Chaka Khan?<eos> You ready to roll on MC Hammer?<eos> You don't know anything about music.<eos> I know it pretty much died around 1977.
Things just keep getting worse.<eos> Where'd you find it?<eos> One of the gym workers.<eos> They were having a celebration for the most membership sales.<eos> - He taped it.<eos> - Do the feds know about it?<eos> The tape?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> - We can't destroy it.<eos> - I know, but we don't need to tell them that it exists.
I'm more competitive than you.<eos> - I don't think so. - I think so.<eos> - Settle down.<eos> - No, settle up.<eos> 'Cause the bill's been paid, and I've paid it, and I've won.<eos> Look, the point is there has to be a way for the government to help places that add community value but don't necessarily rake in the money.<eos> There is not.<eos> The free market is a jungle.<eos> It's beautiful and brutal and should be left alone.<eos> When a business fails, it dies, and a new, better one takes its place.
Elena, your witch, Bonnie.<eos> Do you need her to cast the spell written on your pal Jeremy's hunter's mark...<eos> A tattoo that looks exactly like this?<eos> You want to know something, just ask.<eos> I've been killing vampires my entire life.<eos> Still, this thing refused to reveal itself to me.<eos> That was, until 3 days ago, and it just magically completed for no apparent reason.<eos> Come on, man. Do I look like I know anything about tattoos?<eos> Look at my skin.<eos> It's flawless.
We got to get you up.<eos> You have to help Bonnie.<eos> The hunter stabbed her.<eos> You have to feed her.<eos> Ok.<eos> I just need to make sure that you're ok first.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> The cure.<eos> Jeremy, after everything we've been through, it's right there.

Mmm.<eos> Wow.<eos> Your house is perfect.<eos> No sharp corners, no unsafe balconies, a cool grandpa.<eos> I love two things:<eos> shutting up and giving away money.<eos> Ooh, thanks, Dad.<eos> What's that stone around your neck?<eos> It's a promise stone.<eos> It signifies that if I ever get to be a burden, I just jump in a volcano.
"through the 12 axe heads lined up in the palace.<eos> "None of the suitors could string Ulysses's bow.<eos> "Ulysses was there, unrecognisable.<eos> He picked up his bow."<eos> From 9 until midnight, Évelyne Adam's Compil on France Bleu.<eos> Good evening, everyone.<eos> I'm delighted to be with you again, as always.<eos> I hope you're on top form.<eos> What about tonight's show?<eos> As every night, it will include your songs, your words, the messages you want to send to those far away, whom we will get to know.
Did you sleep?<eos> [distant shouting continues]<eos> [drinking loudly] [sighs]<eos> But I dreamed, Cardinal.<eos> You dreamt without sleeping?<eos> Now that is miraculous.<eos> Call it a waking dream.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I dreamed of a vast conspiracy encircling our beloved Vatican.<eos> It has its roots in the hills of the Romagna, in the great families that would claim St. Peter's as their own.
The lower mandible of their beaks is greatly elongated.<eos> They slice it through the surface of the water at ten metres a second.<eos> If and when it hits a tiny fish, it'll snap shut.<eos> But why come up river to these open sand flats?<eos> This is the answer.<eos> But this nursery will not exist for long.<eos> Four weeks from now, it'll be under ten metres of water.<eos> If by then these chicks can't fly, they will drown.<eos> The problem for young skimmers is that when they hatch, the lower part of their beaks is the same size as the upper.<eos> While they wait for it to grow, they do their best to learn the skimming technique.
At last, the sea.<eos> She has to catch a breath if she's not to drown, but the pounding waves make it desperately difficult.<eos> Beyond the surf, calmer water, but even here, the hatchling is not out of danger.<eos> Just in time.<eos> Only one hatchling in a thousand will survive to adulthood, but if she does, she may live for 80 years.<eos> For now, the ocean is there to be explored.<eos> As the hatchling disappears into the deep blue, she swims into the waters of one the planet's most powerful currents. The Agulhas.<eos> The Agulhas sweeps south towards the Cape, transporting a hundred billion gallons of warm water every day.<eos> These tropical seas are so warm, they evaporate on an enormous scale.<eos> Water vapour rises until, at altitude, it cools and condenses into clouds.
One minute left, and they're not going to make it.<eos> Something has to change.<eos> The silver ant is the hardiest of all desert inhabitants.<eos> Even so, it can only survive outside in the middle of the day for a matter of minutes.<eos> Now, the desert belongs to the sun alone.<eos> The sun has scorched life from the Sahara.<eos> And yet the vast desert it created is a source of life half a world away.<eos> The advancing Sahara vaporised the world's largest lake, leaving behind the silvery remains of countless microscopic algae.<eos> In winter, the wind carries away 700,000 tonnes of this mineral-rich dust every day.<eos> It blows from here all the way to South America, where, astonishingly, it fertilises the Amazon rainforest.
But the consequences of global warming aren't limited to the land.<eos> Africa is almost completely surrounded by oceans.<eos> Here on the east coast, there are animals feeling the change in climate in a most surprising way.<eos> This is a young female green turtle.<eos> During her lifetime, she will travel thousands of miles, through the ocean, looking for food.<eos> Turtles return to the same beach from which they hatched to lay their own eggs.<eos> The eggs are buried in the sand, and the hatchlings will emerge after about two months.<eos> Now, there's a strange thing, about turtle eggs, and that is the temperature at which the eggs are kept will determine the sex of most of the hatchlings.<eos> If the sand temperature is high, they will be female.<eos> If it's low, they will be male.
Every turtle counts.<eos> So each time one is found injured or accidentally caught in the nets, it's brought to Kahindi Changawa and his team.<eos> So we began with only 16 fishermen altogether, in 1998.<eos> Now we have hundreds of fishermen working with us.<eos> Grazing by turtles is essential for the health of the beds of seagrass.<eos> And these are the home of shrimps and lobsters, and that, of course, helps fishermen, too.<eos> The project has a turtle rehabilitation centre, and for the last two years, it's become home to Shelia.<eos> She had an accident with a boat, was hit from behind.<eos> She lost three ribs and her spine was, as well, damaged.<eos> It's now in the process of healing back together.
Those are honestly, like, my three favorite things.<eos> That's cool that you're always saying that.<eos> Yeah, man, I know exactly where the is, and when I get there, what to do with it. Yeah.<eos> Seriously, though, I'm so jealous of you guys.<eos> Slayin' mad older box all the time...<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> These immature high school bitches won't give it up unless you're their boyfriend, so I gotta settle for blowjes. Ohh, that...<eos> aw, man, that must... Suck.<eos> Girls can't even fit my wiener in their mouth.<eos> Yeah, yeah, my dick's so big, it has a ribcage. - Oh, yeah?
Hey, north!<eos> Time for those boy bodies to blossom into man bods.<eos> Let's hit puberty right now!<eos> Check it out, dude.<eos> This chick's totally digging my style.<eos> Ooh. Five, six, seven, eight.<eos> T-I-n-y!<eos> You ain't got no alibi.<eos> Your dick's tiny!<eos> Yeah, yeah, it's tiny!
There's no reason we have to take this so seriously.<eos> Yeah, it's all fun and games until you're looking down the barrel of a back page group shot.<eos> We'll see who's smiling then.<eos> Come on, Fred.<eos> See ya later.<eos> (Dalia) Morning, Tessa.<eos> Why?<eos> Tessa, Dalia came over this morning to take you to school.<eos> That dress is so cute, Tessa.<eos> Sure it is.

Previously on White Collar...<eos> That's the key.<eos> How do we find the evidence box it opens?
I've never heard of June Ellington.<eos> No, but you've heard of her husband, Byron.<eos> Byron Ellington, the trumpeter?<eos> Got a hell of a ride out of that last name. He played with Don Byas back then.<eos> And June sang lead until Byron got sick.<eos> You guys have piqued my interest, but, uh, we're a small operation.<eos> I can't just write a big check at the end of the night.<eos> I'm sure we can work something out. So why would a label let their artist work on the cheap? I think what he means to say is--<eos> Music isn't born in Madison Square Garden.<eos> It starts here, in clubs like this music has to come from somewhere to go somewhere.
It just, um--<eos> I just knew that piece of shit killed Ethan.<eos> You stepped up.<eos> You handled things in the moment.<eos> That's good work.<eos> That means something to me.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Where's Ethan's truck?<eos> I have it.<eos> It's covered in blood.
Tomorrow, yeah?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> That was really good, how you were with her.<eos> There's no way in hell we're going to the police tomorrow... or any day, until we get that belt.<eos> Mom, don't do this.<eos> He's dangerous.<eos> I have to get back in that house.<eos> You know, I'll wait till he's asleep, and then I'll find it.<eos> I already looked there.<eos> Well, it's gotta be there.
What's this $300?<eos> You need to refresh your memory.<eos> I bought some curtains.<eos> Oh, good, 'cause it's not like we have curtains.<eos> Oh, wait a minute.<eos> What are those things hanging down next to the windows?<eos> They're ugly, is what it is.<eos> Ugly and old and make the house look cheap.<eos> You saying the house looks cheap?<eos> Yes I'm saying the house looks cheap, because it is cheap!
- You don't remember?<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> - You don't remember where you physically dumped carloads full of carpeting?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Okay, we're done now.<eos> Okay.<eos> The carpeting isn't gonna still be in that dumpster.<eos> It might be.<eos> That was the first night we moved here.<eos> It's not gonna be there.
- No, I don't.<eos> - You don't remember where you physically dumped carloads full of carpeting?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Okay, we're done now.<eos> Okay.<eos> The carpeting isn't gonna still be in that dumpster.<eos> It might be.<eos> That was the first night we moved here.<eos> It's not gonna be there.<eos> Fine, then it won't be.
♪ I learned to love all of Hollywood's money ♪<eos> ♪ you came along... ♪<eos> - Pete!<eos> - Hey, Dixon.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Wish I wasn't working.<eos> I'm talking about my car.<eos> Oh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's real nice.
I have never... ever lied to you.<eos> And there you were, lying to my face while pretending to give a damn about my father.<eos> I had no idea what Irwin was doing.<eos> He works for you. (Chuckles)<eos> He is your brother.<eos> And I know how you... you bratva, you stick together.<eos> Nicholae... (Gasps)<eos> Mrs. Walraven, you will bring the cocaine to me immediately.<eos> I can't.<eos> I dumped it in the bay where it belongs.
And how many female executives work alongside you?<eos> - Three.<eos> - Making a total of four in a department of nine.<eos> Is there a question?<eos> Yes.<eos> What is the ratio of men to women senior partners at Pearson Hardman?<eos> What?<eos> She has no knowledge of that.<eos> Then I direct the question to you.<eos> And I have the answer, but it's not relevant to this case.
Monica!<eos> I'm not trying to set you up.<eos> I'm trying to take responsibility here.<eos> For what?<eos> For doing exactly what you just said I did.<eos> For drafting the original complaint, starting this whole thing off.<eos> I'm--I'm sorry.<eos> No, no.<eos> The only thing you're sorry about is your little maneuver backfired.<eos> Yeah, but it didn't backfire on me.

Well, you'll see.<eos> Hello?<eos> Yes, everything's fine.<eos> I saw the photo.<eos> I'm so happy for you.<eos> Have you seen what I found?<eos> Do you want it for the baby's room?<eos> Maman, you still haven't redecorated this room.<eos> But...<eos> I'd rather keep it as it is.
Good luck.<eos> Yeah. You, too.<eos> ... can't prove it at this moment?<eos> Correct.<eos> And isn't it true that Frank Landau was disqualified as a co-conspirator?<eos> Well, in the judge's opinion, yes, but that doesn't make it any less true.<eos> Really?<eos> How is that?<eos> The federal court has decided...<eos> No, it hasn't decided.

He's not as old as he looks.<eos> Must've had a tough life.<eos> Are you OK? Scared to death!<eos> Me too.<eos> How about one of just the three of you then?<eos> Oh, well. Goodbye, real world!<eos> One more.<eos> Patience.<eos> I have the patience of a saint.<eos> But it's wearing very thin!
You found it.<eos> Hi, senator. I think I know where they're looking.<eos> Neal: Got something for us.<eos> [ James laughs ] Looks just like it.<eos> Figured you'd keep your anklet away from that one for a while, huh?<eos> At least until we go after the box, which should be about here -- the 50th floor.<eos> This is where it all ends.<eos> Or begins. No more running, no more hiding.<eos> You know how to get it?<eos> Well, Pratt doesn't know where it is.
Simple.<eos> White shirts, black pants.<eos> That'll get us straight through into the building's restaurant.<eos> Then phase two.<eos> I lifted these off the green peeps laundry truck. Fit right in with the FBI.<eos> Once the champagne stand is in place, we put on the greens, and we head upstairs.<eos> We get the box, and I deliver it to you. No.<eos> I'll bring it up.<eos> I've been chasing this evidence for too long.<eos> I'm not letting it get away. Sure.
- Oh, you go ahead.<eos> - Oh, no, ladies first.<eos> - Why not guys first? - Okay.<eos> - Nate "Oz" Osbourne was serving a 15-year sentence for assaulting a police officer when he escaped Hudson Correctional last week.<eos> We cross-referenced Caffrey's physical description -- thank you, Caffrey -- against former Hudson inmates, and we got our guy.<eos> Osbourne and his lady friend abandoned their getaway car at the scene.<eos> NYPD cordoned the area, but so far, no trace.<eos> The perfume wasn't their first target, either.<eos> Their M.O. matches a theft from Weatherby's two days ago -- the wedding ring Joe DiMaggio gave Marilyn Monroe.<eos> It made its way on to the finger of Osbourne's better half.
And just for dinner.<eos> All right?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is that a Jayer Echezeaux?<eos> Is that how you say it?<eos> All I know is -- a case costs 12 grand.<eos> Don't worry. We didn't pay for it.<eos> Now, I'll go out on a limb and say<eos> Penny's ring wasn't a hand-me-down from grandma?<eos> It was Marilyn Monroe's.
I'm warning you.<eos> And I'm educating you.<eos> The moon has no atmosphere, no free oxygen, and no surface moisture.<eos> That's why this rock is vacuum-sealed in nitrogen.<eos> Once it's exposed to our atmosphere, it crumbles to dust in a matter of seconds.<eos> Sara.<eos> I do like to smash things.<eos> Yeah, and I'll shoot both of you.<eos> Not before one of us smashes your rock.<eos> Let Peter go and it's yours.
You can't sleep?<eos> Come here.<eos> Quiet...<eos> You'll wake up mama.<eos> Shh.<eos> Quiet...<eos> Hey, just a minute!<eos> Your card doesn't work.<eos> What?<eos> It worked yesterday.
Tom, you know your ship?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Could it beat a whale?<eos> Is it big enough?<eos> - Well, what in a fight?<eos> - Yeah, if it was like...<eos> - If they bumped into each other?<eos> - Yeah. Yeah.<eos> I think we'd still survive.<eos> What's that thing the whale does when it jumps up and splatters it?

Okay, sailor...<eos> I think you got it from here.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> It's late.<eos> You're not coming up?<eos> I got to go.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Aw, come on.<eos> There's always next year.<eos> Doesn't mean it's gonna be a good year.
Or, as the Germans call it, a fussstreithammer.<eos> What-What-Whatever it's called, it would take something like that to be able to decapitate our Miss Rendell, right?<eos> Definitely has a stronger blade than a playing card.<eos> All right, all right, look-- the-the ace of spades.<eos> All-all our crime scenes are spotless, but the killer left behind the ace of spades.<eos> Why?<eos> I mean, that-that's got to be deliberate.<eos> What did you find out about our card?<eos> I ran the blood.<eos> Confirmed that it did kill Peter Coe.
Beep beep.<eos> Ow!<eos> Ow! [All gasping]<eos> I didn't see you.<eos> You should have yelled, "crossing"!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Okay, so is that my spot?<eos> We are now down to an elite eight.<eos> Well, seven and Toby.<eos> "Be careful of that beaker. It contains dangerous acid!"
Oh, is that right?<eos> The crap he quoted is on my head; I own that.<eos> You don't need to nail yourself to the cross for me to get it-- so I had them edit it out.<eos> Tried to.<eos> Had them.<eos> Before I had them put it back in.<eos> Insisted.<eos> For a guy who's carried a gun most of his life, you really know how to shoot yourself in the foot.<eos> Did Beresford lie?<eos> Did he manipulate your quote in any way that made it worse than it already was?
I'm sorry, Grandpa, but I guess I just don't get the criminal justice system.<eos> Richard Rourke lied to the police, and that's not enough to get him arrested?<eos> But Uncle Danny's friend is in jail for some stupid fight he didn't even start?<eos> How is that justice?<eos> Yeah, I'm with Nicky.<eos> I mean, Rourke is obviously hiding something, and Bobby was just standing up for himself.<eos> How is that fair?<eos> And whoever said life was fair?<eos> Life should be far, shouldn't it?<eos> - Yeah, it should, sweetie.
Hence the separate rooms.<eos> But I think this trip is really gonna change all that.<eos> My husband will finally see me not as a world-famous police detective, but as a woman.<eos> Your husband's a lucky man.<eos> That he is.<eos> Mm. Tastes of bog.<eos> You see?<eos> It's funny because it's clear.<eos> Actually I would like to say something.<eos> I am friends with a couple of huge Inspector Spacetime fans, and I think what they like about the show is that it's smart, complicated, and doesn't talk down to its audience.
- This is worse than last time.<eos> - Honestly, physically removing you now.<eos> - I'm going.<eos> - Out of my house.<eos> It's a sour ball, not a bank safe.<eos> Just open the candy.<eos> - Are you hungry?<eos> - Yes, I'm starving.<eos> Why don't you go upstairs to the kitchen?<eos> It's full of food.
But, as you must realize by now, these humans are different.<eos> Yes.<eos> For their sake, I sincerely hope so.<eos> What?<eos> Just the smell of fresh pine.<eos> It's good to get out of the city.<eos> It gets my blood flowing.<eos> It's not the mountain air.<eos> It's the fact that you think the war's gonna go on.<eos> You think you want it to end.
I'd say you've become an expert on disappointment.<eos> In fact, I think the only reason you want to talk is the Volm have you on the run.<eos> You don't trust me.<eos> I would feel the same if I were in your shoes.<eos> I could tell you I've made mistakes, that I regret the way I've gone about some things, but those would just seem like empty words to you.<eos> You got that right.<eos> Which is why I didn't expect to reconcile our differences in one conversation.<eos> But I am confident there will be more unpleasant discoveries about the Volm.<eos> This war has gone on for centuries.<eos> And it will continue for a long time to come.
J'accuse!<eos> I had a point, and they knew it.<eos> You see, in early 2013,<eos> I was the only single guy in the group.<eos> Which meant whenever Marshall or Barney bought something they weren't allowed to keep in their apartments... ♪<eos> You know what, Ted?<eos> That reminds me.<eos> I just bought this antique Swiss clock, but Robin won't let us put it in the apartment, so I was gonna leave it at your place.<eos> Only problem?<eos> It's broken.
But i do know that right now you have a choice, And you're gonna have to live with it.<eos> Unfortunately, i had to live with far worse.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I told you not to follow me.<eos> My choice just became... Much easier.<eos> All right, they kept the girls in a dorm Somewhere in this area, But now that lynch doesn't need them anymore...<eos> Wh-What do you mean, doesn't need them?<eos> They're just guinea pigs, lab rats.<eos> The seed--It's...<eos> it's in her now.
Would you like a drink?<eos> I'm sorry, I don't have any juice, but I could get you some water.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I, er, I need you to tell me exactly when you last saw your sister alive.<eos> I told you yesterday, it would've been when I left for the spa, at about 1.45.<eos> And when you last saw June, she was wearing the zebra-print scarf?<eos> No.<eos> She thought she'd lost it.<eos> Lost it?<eos> Yes, it was new.
Does that sound selfish?<eos> No.<eos> Did you meet anyone?<eos> Can anyone else vouch for you being in this bar?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It was called The Shack or something.<eos> The barman was chatty but...<eos> And what's this selfishness got me, now June's dead?<eos> I've got all the freedom I want, I've got all the money I need, but the guilt...<eos> It'll never go away, will it?
It was like bloody Tiananmen Square.<eos> Hand pump after hand pump after hand pump after hand pump.<eos> DOUGIE:<eos> Good one. Ah!<eos> Brilliant! Don't believe it!<eos> Toad.<eos> - What?<eos> - Got a toad.<eos> Where'd it come from?<eos> Did it come from there?
It's Melissa, isn't it?<eos> Yeah. I'm Peggy.<eos> This is Elaine.<eos> I know.<eos> OK if we come in for a sec?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> You have the most incredible skin!<eos> Have people told you that before?<eos> Not really.<eos> So pretty it glows.
But I don't think I will do it.<eos> I feel that I, how can I put it, haven't quite finished here yet.<eos> OK.<eos> I'm always here for you, if you need anything.<eos> OK.<eos> OK... see you later.<eos> Karel says you haven't been answering your mobile phone for days.<eos> Is everything OK, Luc?<eos> That's the second time you've asked me that question.<eos> It's still a stupid one.
- Court rise.<eos> It is a Walther P5, 9mm.<eos> A German gun. It cannot be obtained without a permit.<eos> It was the standard issue gun of the Dutch police from 1979 to 2013.<eos> It is also very popular among Eastern European criminals.<eos> Because it is very accurate and, in spite of its large calibre, is quite small and easy to handle.<eos> Mr Lachaert, one more question.<eos> You referred to a gun that was easy to use.<eos> What did you mean?<eos> What I said, that it is easy to handle.
Manipulation.<eos> Arbitrariness.<eos> And the law was introduced, was fought for, to protect the citizens of a democracy from mala fide forces who benefit from arbitrariness and manipulation.<eos> That is the difference, the point where democracy becomes dictatorship.<eos> Which is why there are rules, procedures and laws that have to be adhered to.<eos> And not just if it happens to be convenient, but always.<eos> Kenny De Groot's basic rights were trampled on.<eos> It is not because his neighbours don't like him that he does not have the same rights as you and me and everyone else.<eos> Because the law guarantees equality.<eos> It must guarantee it.
First, I was thinking a knife or a sword.<eos> Yeah, but pollen, and rust... Mm-hmm, and the blade shape would be consistent with long shears.<eos> You think garden shears?<eos> Or hedge clippers, but, yeah, exactly.<eos> Does that help?<eos> Well, I'm sure it does.<eos> I just wish I knew how.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Where's the party?<eos> It starts here.
Oh, uh, excuse me.<eos> Relax, you missed the best part.<eos> Your message said the report came back from the lab on the pollen?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Would you mind?<eos> Oh... kay. Thanks, detective.<eos> I'm running late already, and I don't think my date's going to appreciate being kept waiting by a bowel dissection.<eos> Okay, the pollen is from an exotic species of plant, called the Fuchsia Magellanica Aurea.<eos> Pretty.<eos> Yes, it's native to South America.
You know, Ray Jay is threatening to run off with Juliette to Paris.<eos> Well, do you want me to...<eos> No.<eos> No, you can't do anything.<eos> I can't do anything.<eos> No, he's just -- he's got to come to his senses on his own.<eos> Problem being that I don't think he has any sense right now.<eos> [ Chuckles ]<eos> But Juliette can't leave until the situation with Mark Cuban is resolved, right?<eos> Well, it has been.
The application fee for a marijuana dispensary increases from $2,000 to $5,000.<eos> I didn't want to get greedy.<eos> It's good for the state budget.<eos> Well... (Sighs) I think... it might start to seem obvious that the initiative isn't exactly genuine.<eos> Dispensary locations to be at least 300 yards away from the nearest school.<eos> We should change that to 500.<eos> We're the third-largest school district in the country.<eos> - If you make it 500...<eos> It makes it transparent that the law isn't about medical marijuana.<eos> It's about protecting your market.
Yeah. Ricky "Bam-Bam" Perez.<eos> Well, maybe Machine and Ricky got together to patch things up?<eos> Nah. Machine didn't have a reverse gear.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm not shilling no protein powder.<eos> It's not shilling.<eos> It's endorsing.<eos> Why would I endorse it?<eos> Protein powder don't make you a champion.<eos> It doesn't not make you a champion.
You know, I still remember...<eos> When Alexis was born, they handed me this... tiny person, all bundled up.<eos> She just... stared up at me.<eos> And when I looked down at her, this feeling hit me...<eos> Like I'd been struck by lightning.<eos> It was love.<eos> That instant, inexplicable love you can only feel for your child.<eos> In that moment, I knew.<eos> I knew my life had changed forever.<eos> And now it's about to change again.
Psst.<eos> By the way.<eos> If you ever need to tell someone about your day...<eos> You can tell me.<eos> What's that?<eos> Felicity pulled it up.<eos> It's an old map of a decommissioned subway line.<eos> Runs underneath the low rent district of the city.<eos> I've seen that map before.<eos> It was right in front of our faces the entire time.
I'm fine.<eos> Dean, I can still go out there.<eos> I can still hunt.<eos> Really?<eos> This is stupid.<eos> All right.<eos> You hit that target, we'll talk about you getting back out there.<eos> No problem.<eos> Look, man, that second trial hit you a lot harder than that first one.<eos> I don't know whether it was just more intense or what.
And the wound to the ulna was from a smaller caliber bullet.<eos> The victim was shot with two different guns.<eos> Okay, now, that was genius.<eos> I actually am a genius.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> The swabs from the glancing blow to-- oh.<eos> Hello.<eos> The swabs from the glancing blow to the ulna contain concrete aggregate, traces of dried algae and peregrine falcon feces.<eos> So the wound to the ulna was the result of a ricochet off of a concrete structure.<eos> The bullet transferred the material from the object it struck... to the victim's ulna.
You choose option two, you cannot let him die.<eos> I know.<eos> But the rest of it, I, um...<eos> Keep him alive, Agent Warren, whatever it takes.<eos> [Phone beeps] I can't believe you just did that.<eos> What, Charlie?<eos> I presented the kid with a choice.<eos> [Screaming] Come, come, my hero.<eos> - [Screaming] - Do you smell that?<eos> Human flesh has a charcoal scent when it burns.
Yeah, I got a story.<eos> You like it?<eos> Yeah, I like it.<eos> Badass, right?<eos> How do you come up with it?<eos> That's my talent.<eos> And what I see inspires me.<eos> All the crazy fuckers in my neighborhood?<eos> Everyone got to be inspired by his life.<eos> Well, my life's not inspiring; it's boring.
If we're going to do... This, It has to be about honoring tommy.<eos> I need to become the man he hoped I could be.<eos> You two have helped me take the first step.<eos> So what's step two?<eos> I'm game for anything as long as it doesn't involve skydiving.<eos> And I'm pretty down on landmines now, too.<eos> The city still needs saving.<eos> But not by the hood.<eos> And not by some vigilante Who's just crossing names off a list.<eos> It needs...

Do I have any friends?<eos> Well, you said we could all be friends with you as long as we kept your secret.<eos> What secret?<eos> I don't know.<eos> If they so much as even scratch the paint on my car.<eos> Why don't you just be grateful sheriff Forbes was able to track down the car after you let them, uh...<eos> You know, steal it from you.<eos> Remind me to send her some mini-muffins.<eos> Do we really need 10 gallons of gas or are you making me just lug this around as punishment?<eos> Well, they ditched your car after it ran out of fuel.
I'm reaching out to you despite everything that you have done, and you still can't get out of your own way.<eos> God!<eos> I feel sorry for you.<eos> Don't turn your back on me!<eos> I should have turned my back on you ages ago!<eos> It's gone.<eos> What?<eos> The pain.<eos> The pain is gone.<eos> Oh, see, it was never there.
It was the opportunity to plant it.<eos> I'll call Brass.<eos> Russell.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Just hit the liquor store near the high school to check out Sean McHenry's story.<eos> Store clerk has him on camera buying whiskey within an hour of Becca's death.<eos> That much we already know from Sean, though, don't we?<eos> But big man on campus left out one big thing.<eos> A bright yellow Dumpster on the edge of the store lot.<eos> It was begging to be searched.
Math.<eos> He was one of the good ones.<eos> He saw some of the things that I had... scrawled in my notebooks, and... I told him to leave me alone.<eos> He told me enough people had done that already.<eos> He didn't know about the bomb or what I was up to, but... he said whatever it was, it wasn't worth it.<eos> So, 15 years, you become a teacher yourself, helping kids going through the same stuff.<eos> But that bomb-- still there.<eos> Every day.<eos> Surrounded by innocent kids.<eos> I was pretty sure that it wouldn't go off accidentally.
Lee's called ten times.<eos> Put him through.<eos> Hold on.<eos> You're on.<eos> Where the fuck are you?<eos> I've called at least ten times...<eos> I've never seen the Pacific Ocean.<eos> Dreamt about it in prison.<eos> What color is the water?<eos> It's nice.
So if this fellow landed in the ocean, it would be "one more for Curtis".<eos> That's really sweet.<eos> But how does it help?<eos> Well, Leo said he was going to e-mail the results to his mother.<eos> So, so he must have had some way of recording it?<eos> A camera. The camera!<eos> The camera was attached to the radiosonde, but the duck wasn't fixed properly.<eos> Maybe he didn't have a chance to secure it because he saw his attacker approaching.<eos> But Camille, what if the camera was recording?<eos> It might have caught something. Yeah.
Now she's going to think I hung up on her.<eos> You know the best thing you can do now is sleep.<eos> Your brain needs rest before the exam. No, no, no.<eos> I can't, I've tried and it feels like I'm sleeping on duty.<eos> You know what, I think I'll do some more revision.<eos> This one is ice cold.<eos> Put it on your face, it'll help with the swelling. Ow.<eos> Yeah, I told you not to go out there.<eos> Look, there was a camera at the scene. Hmm?<eos> It could have recorded the murder or captured something.
So why doesn't your aunt like you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She just doesn't like me.<eos> For example, one time, when I was ten, and we were at our Hamptons beach house--<eos> I already don't like you.<eos> I wanted my night-night cocoa in my special seagull mug--<eos> Now I hate you.<eos> And my aunt Charity, who was babysitting because everybody else was in Europe at the dressage competition...<eos> Now I've beat you up and left you for dead.<eos> Told me my seagull cup was broken and I knew it wasn't.
I know you do.<eos> I jog through every night just hoping one of these places will go on the market.<eos> - Yeah. - I can't help it.<eos> I just...<eos> I see us here.<eos> I see you here, too.<eos> In fact, I see you right... here.<eos> Is that house being listed?<eos> Nope.<eos> And it never will be.
You asked me to choose.<eos> So in a way, I did.<eos> - Right?<eos> - Right.<eos> And what you chose was to send me away instead of keeping me close to you, and that's what hurts me the most.<eos> What now?<eos> Nothing now.<eos> We're over.<eos> I just can't believe you got an offer on your house already.<eos> I mean, it wasn't even on the market.
This is her daughter, Rebecca.<eos> Hello. Kev wroted TWAT on a crab.<eos> Did you?<eos> Why?<eos> Yes, with marker pen.<eos> And MUFF and QUIM.<eos> ANUS.<eos> Brilliant.<eos> I saw his knob. It's the worstest knob in the world.<eos> It's terrible.

Father kills his own son to keep him quiet?<eos> You think that's impossible?<eos> I don't know.<eos> One of the night-boats radioed in.<eos> No sign of anyone on it.<eos> Who do we call?<eos> Harbour master?<eos> Coastguard?<eos> I need people out there collecting every piece.<eos> The tide's coming in. It will wash up soon enough.
Thank you for reporting it.<eos> I've given a picture to SOCO. Leave it with me.<eos> You can go now.<eos> But if you find it was, can I have the story?<eos> Don't announce it, give it to me.<eos> If was our boat - my boat.<eos> Dad's boat.<eos> Ellie?<eos> Oh, God, Brian, I just want to go home.<eos> That picture you got of the boat it's a match with what we have.
You didn't want to spend the rest of your life with him.<eos> Now he's free to find someone who does.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, really.<eos> Pete will get over this, and so will you.<eos> In the long run, it'll all be for the best.<eos> Brighter days ahead, Pen.<eos> Don't you lose her, David.<eos> Don't you lose her!<eos> So you're saying people should... ♪ Thank the black plague for what it did?
George is loyal to your husband, it seems.<eos> Today.<eos> We may have to forgive him... leave our vengeance to God.<eos> Never.<eos> Leave us.<eos> I have to go again, tonight.<eos> You hope to capture Margaret of Anjou?<eos> She is riding west to join forces with Jasper Tudor.<eos> Just do whatever it takes to end this.<eos> If one battle can bring peace to England, peace of mind, it's one worth fighting.
Men!<eos> Why "damned twice"?<eos> Because I'm French, of course!<eos> Tewkesbury!<eos> Once we cross the river, we are midway to victory.<eos> We will join Jasper Tudor's forces, return to England and hunt Edward down!<eos> May God grant us victory!<eos> Your Grace.<eos> Yes.<eos> The river... it's too high from this rain... And we will all die in the morning if we are caught this side of the border.
Mm, good one.<eos> You come out of the closet yet?<eos> [Forced laughter] No.<eos> Only closet I'm in is the one that I'm trapped in.<eos> With R. Kelly, watching a rap opera.<eos> Ah, cut the crap.<eos> I know why you're here.<eos> You want to weasel back onto my health insurance, you damn freeloader.<eos> I'm not a freeloader, okay?<eos> It's just I can't afford health insurance, and I expect it to be free.
Can I, uh, get you anything else, sir?<eos> Mm. Wow! Sorry that I asked.<eos> Did Kirkin just wink at you?<eos> Yeah, that's his way of letting me know that he's ready.<eos> Can I get you a drink?<eos> Vodka soda, please. Okay.<eos> Where's your restroom?<eos> All the way down on the right.<eos> Eric, I'm sending you eyewitness footage right now.<eos> Make sure it gets onto the local news outlets and onto the Internet.
Shouldn't you be at the funeral?<eos> I'm leaving in a few minutes.<eos> I've been up... all night working on Carrion, finishing it.<eos> The fingerprint matched your father's immigration file.<eos> One funeral's enough for today.<eos> I just hope there aren't countless more coming down the pike.<eos> I can't tell you what to do, Padma.<eos> But when they make contact, keep in mind that the people that took your dad don't have the best track record when it comes to fulfilling their end of the bargain.<eos> Death is a thief.<eos> It takes and keeps all that a person is... That a person was.

Long time ago, Frank.<eos> Cameron wasn't at home the nights of the last two killings.<eos> What do I do, Gibbs?<eos> I mean, I can't go to the police and say I suspect my own son.<eos> Well... maybe I can give you a little peace of mind-- ask around, get Metro PD to give me something that eliminates Cameron as a suspect.<eos> Can you do it without giving up his name?<eos> Because if I'm wrong, and he finds out, it'll be the end of what's ever left of our relationship.<eos> Thank you for letting me borrow your controller, Tim.<eos> You were right-- the yaw sensitivity is outstanding.<eos> It anticipates your moves.
Got to go.<eos> Got here as quickly as I could.<eos> This about the glyph in your father's notebook?<eos> Felicity is still working on that.<eos> We have another problem.<eos> Starling City is once again at war with the drug known on the streets as Vertigo.<eos> It used to be the city's most lethal vice, but the purple and green pill was nowhere to be found for the last 3 months.<eos> Over the past few days, the city has been flooded with a new version of Vertigo.<eos> More addictive, more unstable.<eos> It killed a girl in the club.
I should do it.<eos> [Sirens in distance]<eos> [Banging on door]<eos> [Rock music playing]<eos> What you need?<eos> All right.<eos> The person of color has successfully purchased your drugs.<eos> For the record, I offered.<eos> How will we know when the tracker is active?<eos> It already is.
Come on.<eos> She might have gotten to the end of her life and thought,<eos> "Why didn't I try to get that work out there?"<eos> Some people's character prevents them from pushing that little bit you need to push to get the work seen.<eos> You know, she didn't defend herself as an artist.<eos> She just did the work.<eos> A canon is often established. And so, when someone comes in, there's always the sense that they're secondary figures.<eos> But I don't feel her as secondary.<eos> When I look at the pictures, I always feel something primary.<eos> I think that the work is so good that it's really winning over a lot of people who were... were dismissive of it previously.
- Good.<eos> You forgot the bathroom light.<eos> Oh yeah!<eos> - That's familiar.<eos> - Did you think I'd change?<eos> No.<eos> I like this sculpture.<eos> Yes, the technique is exquisite.<eos> It's simple, yet sophisticated.<eos> Yes, it's very beautiful.
Should we stop to eat?<eos> No. Give me a sandwich.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It's good.<eos> So what's the problem with the insurance?<eos> It's easy, no one wants to cover the accident.<eos> Not Global, not the supplemental, or the mutual fund.<eos> Because he was abroad over 3 months.<eos> And the snow card?<eos> It even covers accidents off the slopes.
All piss and vinegar.<eos> What can you do?<eos> - Same ourselves once. - Here's how it is.<eos> You round up your boys and get off my patch and we'll leave it at that.<eos> Might put the fear of God into the locals, but this is me.<eos> First and final.<eos> Workhouse rules, Fred.<eos> Last man standing.<eos> So be it.<eos> You think you've found somewhere decent, some place the rot hasn't got to yet, but it creeps in.
I said it was college business.<eos> - Which it is.<eos> - Might the Professor Coke Norris have carried the day if he'd spoken against?<eos> He would not.<eos> The land has been in college ownership for nearly 50 years.<eos> It's ours to dispose of as we think best.<eos> Why?<eos> Is the college short of funds?<eos> Management of the land has been a constant drain on resources.<eos> The decision was as much about what the college stood to save by letting it go as about what it might gain.
Please.<eos> The morning of the day he was killed, you took a train to London the 10:40?<eos> That's right.<eos> And the day you came back, what train did you catch?<eos> The... 9:50.<eos> So you'd have left your flat at what time, about half-past nine?<eos> Around that, yes.<eos> - After the first post.<eos> But when I visited your London flat, I found a letter addressed to your husband on the mat.<eos> It would have arrived that morning.
Yes. Yes, he is.<eos> Thursday.<eos> I wonder, might you identify this handwriting, Dr Prentice?<eos> When was this?<eos> Which?<eos> In the red.<eos> When did it happen? Do you know?<eos> That's Frank's scrawl.<eos> I'd know it a mile off. I see.<eos> It's even worse than mine. Yeah.
They're on to the next story.<eos> (Man) We're reporting live from the White House.<eos> In a daring pre-dawn raid, U.S. special forces have freed American hostages held in Kashfar...<eos> The operation a model of precision, with no casualties among the hostages and all four of their captors dead...<eos> In contrast to the previous attempt, this mission is being termed a complete and resounding success, and has provided a much-needed confidence boost to the Grant administration tonight after several weeks of political embarrassments.<eos> Until this evening, the hostage situation in Kashfar... (Turns tv off)<eos> Did you come here to gloat?<eos> Why would I?<eos> Looks like the mission went perfectly.<eos> It did.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system.<eos> A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything.
Yes, sir.<eos> Is the house still sealed off? It is.<eos> We allowed Mrs Powell to stay, but the murder scene's been preserved.<eos> OK, get everyone to the house.<eos> First I need a search warrant.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I want to search the bedroom above the study.<eos> The murder weapon is not here.<eos> The house was sealed off.<eos> It has to be here.
Just as it was you who emptied the charity's bank accounts.<eos> And bought the plane ticket in his name to make it look like he was about to skip the country.<eos> I'm sorry, you saw me!<eos> I was in the garden when he was killed!<eos> Ah, yes, you were, weren't you?<eos> And you can't be in two places at the same time, can you?<eos> Therefore - logically - seeing as you're the killer...<eos> Mr Powell must have been killed at a different time.<eos> A fact that I was able to prove about ten minutes ago when I found the murder weapon. in the bedroom above the study.<eos> The house was sealed off, it has to be here.
Yeah, maybe.<eos> Look, I think the inspector is a man of his word.<eos> I tell you what though, he was funny.<eos> It could have been 110 in the shade and he'll be sitting there in a suit and tie drinking a cup of tea.<eos> Moaning about how hot it is!<eos> Of course it's hot!<eos> You've got a woollen suit on!<eos> Or with the motorbike, he would hold on so tight like that. It was like Wallace and Gromit.<eos> His knuckles were white.<eos> I tell him the jeep was being used even when it wasn't, just to get him in the sidecar.
I'm proud of you. That's all.<eos> For what?<eos> For doing your time with your mouth shut.<eos> For going out like a man.<eos> Dying in a jumpsuit doesn't make you a man.<eos> Open eight!<eos> You and Kallie used to come here?<eos> Yeah, and up on that bridge.<eos> She used to stare down at the water.<eos> Said she liked the way it looked or something.
How's the front end looking Bobby?<eos> I'm not a captain yet sir.<eos> Bobby look out!<eos> Get down!<eos> The tornado is coming this way.<eos> Baz!<eos> Second tornado!<eos> Second tornado!<eos> The tornado is headed towards the airport.<eos> We need to destroy it before it get to them.
Second tornado!<eos> Second tornado!<eos> The tornado is headed towards the airport.<eos> We need to destroy it before it get to them.<eos> Why!<eos> Baz!<eos> Baz!<eos> Dad!<eos> You have to leave him!<eos> It's getting closer.

I don't know what happens.<eos> But I'm glad you were here.<eos> A drug smuggler shot at me with a spear gun last night.<eos> Is that a first for you?<eos> Wish I could say yes.<eos> I'm glad you made it back, Mr. Reese.<eos> - I am too.<eos> And I'm glad the machine was right.<eos> How so?<eos> It was smart enough to tell us about a killer with multiple identities.
And the beds are now numbered differently, so just pay attention.<eos> And now what you have all been waiting for...<eos> Mm, the Lodox-- low-dose radiation X-ray statscanner.<eos> It provides full-body anterior and lateral views.<eos> - The low radiation makes imaging safer for children and pregnant women.<eos> It is our most cutting-edge tool in diagnostic technology.<eos> Murphy.<eos> When can we use it?<eos> Oh! I'll volunteer.<eos> When I was 6, I stuck a marble up my nose, and it never came out.
Her whole personality could be affected.<eos> Her memory could be gone, and that man out there is gonna kill me.<eos> Did I ever tell you the first time I went fly-fishing?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, I went out to the Hoh river to fish winter steelhead.<eos> For hours, I tried to cast like I'd practiced.<eos> But if you over try, it'll never happen.<eos> And then just once, the rod loaded perfectly.<eos> The line formed a tight loop, and the fly just danced out over the river about 70 feet.<eos> It had a life of its own.
Dr. Wilson, right?<eos> Um, you saw us the other night.<eos> I'm Casey Hedges.<eos> That's my son Parker.<eos> Right.<eos> Is he still sick?<eos> Well, his fever was down when I left for my shift.<eos> I'm a waitress.<eos> But then my neighbor called.<eos> She said it spiked again, and then when I got home, he had this rash.
I didn't start the fight.<eos> That guy was being a dick.<eos> He thinks he can just go around doing whatever he wants.<eos> I know he's a dick.<eos> But he's not my responsibility. You are.<eos> Your dad's pretty worried about you.<eos> Oh, God, yeah, I know he's worried.<eos> I feel it all the time.<eos> The doctors gave me their blessing to come here.<eos> If my leukemia comes back, it comes back.
I don't know.<eos> Callie didn't even tell me she'd done it till a few weeks later, and by then, she and Drew were back together.<eos> And I tried to get her to talk about it, but she said it was all in the past.<eos> She was like that-- she kept everything bottled up; private.<eos> So, when she didn't return my phone calls after Drew showed me the video, I wasn't surprised.<eos> After a few weeks, Rebecca went to the police.<eos> They tried to locate Callie via her cell phone, credit card, e-mail records, but they came up empty.<eos> She hadn't used any of them since before she disappeared.<eos> They questioned Drew, but he managed to convince them the video was authentic.<eos> Oh, you-you think it's a fake?
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system.<eos> A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything.
Should I be jealous?<eos> Definitely not.<eos> Come on in.<eos> You know, if I didn't know any better, I'd think this was a booty call.<eos> If it's the booty calling, it's not a booty call.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Well, as long as you'll respect me in the morning.<eos> It is the morning, and the goal is to respect you a little less.<eos> ♪ Charlie ain't home ...has that box gone out yet?<eos> Uh, it's right over here.
What were the offerings? Huh?<eos> Uh, what did the great spirit's sacred messenger ask for?<eos> Stories.<eos> He asked the people to tell him stories.<eos> I bet I know what the blessings were.<eos> I've been all over them.<eos> It's not there.<eos> Why?<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Let us put the tablet back where it should be.
She thinks that your touching the tablet has broken her spell over you. Hmm?<eos> The tablets weren't meant for the Angels, and they weren't meant for you.<eos> She's got a lot on her plate, so you can't fault her for missing it.<eos> I was thinking to myself, "self, "if Cass got away from her by touching the tablet, why would he ever stop touching the tablet?"<eos> And then I thought to myself,<eos> "self...he hasn't stopped touching the tablet, now, has he?"<eos> Oh, you're a pip, you are.<eos> What?<eos> Oh! This is the king.<eos> The kid told us where the other half was, but it...wasn't.
Rejecting what?<eos> Marriage.<eos> I just... need time to think.<eos> Point of ricochet.<eos> Meaning?<eos> As much as I hate to say it, your guy's still innocent.<eos> I based part of my calculations on witness testimony, which of course is inherently unreliable, unlike physical evidence.<eos> I...<eos> Here, you can see that the lamp is still intact.<eos> It was standing on the opposite side of the room from the doorway into the Camelia Room.
Should I?<eos> Is it my get-out-of-jail-free card?<eos> It's a yes-or-no question.<eos> I'm not the one on a clock here.<eos> True.<eos> The wedding band-- silver-- it's a fake, in case you were wondering.<eos> Is there anything specific you can tell me about this ring?<eos> The fact I didn't want to give it to her?<eos> She was pregnant.<eos> What about any markings, any imperfections it might have?

He's been lying all along.<eos> Whoa, whoa, hold up.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I shouldn't have come here.<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> He was there in the apartment.<eos> He killed his wife, end of story.<eos> What about the ring?<eos> You said it yourself.<eos> It could be anybody's.
I was fine.<eos> Why'd they go to you?<eos> Some freighter on the way to China thought I was in trouble, which I might have been if I was dragging nets, but I don't.<eos> I only fish with poles.<eos> Pole-caught tuna.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Saw it on a menu.<eos> Better fish with poles.<eos> Better for the ocean, too.<eos> Other boats don't care about that, but if we don't take care of the sea, it won't take care of us.
We're keeping the couch.<eos> - That's what we thought.<eos> - Good plan.<eos> Hi, boys.<eos> So, I suppose you heard about my conversion at Vic Falls.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And we saw the play.<eos> Well, I made a commitment that day, and I'm gonna keep to it.<eos> So I've started the Infeld foundation.<eos> It's going to be dedicated to elevating lives, building dreams, and raising humanity to its pinnacle.
Yeah.<eos> - Go. Go. Go.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Come on, Henry.<eos> I would appreciate it if you didn't make surprise appearances, especially when we are adjusting to new routines.<eos> Sure.<eos> Clark had a talk with Martha last night.<eos> - And?<eos> - Amador wore a ring.<eos> Apparently, it wasn't on his body.
I tell you who's got it right, Derek.<eos> That's who I'd want to be, if I could be anyone.<eos> He's always happy, he's enthusiastic, he's popular, he's funny, heart of gold.<eos> Yeah, that's who I'd be.<eos> Come back as Derek.<eos> Wouldn't have much, you know, going on in his head, but what he has got going on, it's all good.<eos> Waiting for the car, isn't it?<eos> Black Mercedes, take us back.<eos> It's coming round.<eos> It can't come in here cos it's a graveyard, isn't it?
Previously on "Dallas"...<eos> Put Ramos on the rig job.<eos> I want him fully compromised.<eos> We got a problem, sir. Your daughter is on the rig.<eos> Just do it.<eos> Your wife sustained a severe trauma in the explosion.<eos> What about the babies?<eos> I'm doing everything I can.<eos> No one was supposed to be on that rig.<eos> You're telling me it already went off?
"So... remember that time when you got grounded for 'borrowing' daddy's favorite shotgun?<eos> You swore up and down it wasn't you, but daddy said there was no point in lying, 'cause he found those extra shells in your room.<eos> Well, we both know it was me that planted those shells.<eos> Now it's time to play that card again.<eos> I can... "<eos> [Voice breaking] And he just goes on.<eos> [Sighs]<eos> Come here.<eos> "I can never make up for all the terrible, hurtful things I did to you, Bobby, and I have no excuses either one of us would believe,<eos> but I hope in the quiet place in your heart where the truth lives, that my jealousy, as powerful as it was, was nothing compared to my love for you."

You have something we want.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> My mother warned me this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city.<eos> No, we just want information.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, I've got that in spades.<eos> Ravage me.<eos> We heard you read the letter from Howard's father.<eos> I did.<eos> What did it say?
- Yeah.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Look, it's about Brick.<eos> Uh, Shelby said that he's been really clumsy lately. And that he's been getting a ton of headaches.<eos> And then there's this miraculously healed hand injury.<eos> Wait, Brick would not fake a hand injury... no way.<eos> That is not like him.<eos> No, it's not. Later, Tucker.<eos> Okay, look, Shelby is worried.<eos> And the more I think about it, when were driving home, that tree branch was in the middle of the road the whole time, but Brick swears that it came out of nowhere.
So the chances of containing this, essentially, are three eighths of sod all.<eos> Hello, Mary.<eos> Maxine, I'm DCI John Luther, you all right?<eos> This man, the killer, he spoke to you?<eos> He did, yeah.<eos> What did he say?<eos> He, erm... ..he told me not to be afraid.<eos> Do you remember anything about his voice?<eos> Maybe he had an accent?<eos> It was nice.
Hey!<eos> [Loud beep, explosion]<eos> [Screams]<eos> - Is Sonya okay?<eos> - She's fine.<eos> The explosive was just a diversion so she couldn't get a look at him.<eos> What was he trying to do?<eos> Take out a server array.<eos> [Sighs] Anything?<eos> The charge was small enough that it could have sat undetected for weeks.
The land will be yours.<eos> You can live there in peace with Clea.<eos> Ulysses came to welcome us.<eos> He had a thick gray beard, powerful muscles,<eos> a lot of presence.<eos> I see why you love him, my queen.<eos> The scar...<eos> tell me about the scar.<eos> I want to be sure it's him.<eos> It starts here and goes up the thigh.
I want to govern for the people.<eos> For the warriors, the free men of Ithaca. So they can finally have prosperity and happiness.<eos> You've already written a speech?<eos> I promised the gods one thing - to bring a king to Ithaca.<eos> I'm tired of your gods.<eos> Liodes, don't insult the gods.<eos> I'm on your side. Don't be afraid.<eos> Of men or gods.<eos> Oh, Artemis, watch over queen Penelope and our island of Ithaca.<eos> Bring it the prosperity and stability it once had.
I'm on your side. Don't be afraid.<eos> Of men or gods.<eos> Oh, Artemis, watch over queen Penelope and our island of Ithaca.<eos> Bring it the prosperity and stability it once had.<eos> You aren't praying for Ulysses?<eos> I've prayed every day for 10 years.<eos> If he hasn't returned, the goddess can't hear me.<eos> Maybe she'll hear today.<eos> Try again.<eos> Faith pleases the gods, but it's starting to irritate the people.
It's over now.<eos> You're here safe and sound.<eos> There's no more danger.<eos> "No more danger."<eos> Is this how you greet a friend?<eos> A king.<eos> But above all a friend.<eos> I don't know what I missed more, you or war.<eos> Forget war.<eos> It doesn't deserve to be missed.
- I hope so.<eos> Continue to be faithful and honor him.<eos> Before I left, the king was respected and ruled alone.<eos> There was no assembly to contest his orders.<eos> You were gone a long time.<eos> The assembly of free men decided to meet over any death sentence.<eos> This is a slave.<eos> Clea is no longer a slave.<eos> The law is clear.<eos> It defends free men and women.
Will you love me as Ulysses loved Penelope?<eos> I'm not worthy of such love.<eos> Thank you for hosting us.<eos> Our ship is waiting.<eos> Thank you, Alcinoos.<eos> I need to speak to her.<eos> Nausicaa?<eos> Help Telemachus, Nausicaa.<eos> A king's task is heavy.<eos> It isolates him.
Thank you.<eos> May the gods be with you.<eos> May they not abandon us.<eos> The Pheacians leave, but their army may return.<eos> Behind you!<eos> Menelaus's guard dog.<eos> What were you plotting?<eos> Why come to my island?<eos> Your island?<eos> Enjoy it while it's still yours.
Let him come.<eos> Is this what you learn in Sparta, putting poison in men's hearts?<eos> Your father doesn't need me for that.<eos> You came to pray to Apollo?<eos> Why pray to a god who doesn't answer me?<eos> - Perhaps to soothe your soul.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> I know that anger has won you over and fogs your mind.<eos> Should I control my anger when it's justified?<eos> It's eating you up.
Seemed like it.<eos> Fucking ridiculous!<eos> And the film, was it good?<eos> It was fucking brilliant.<eos> It's gonna take ages to see it over here.<eos> There was one really absurd scene.<eos> The guys, who were a real heavy crew took this dick sculpture and fucked a woman with it.<eos> It was a very, very big dick, Marquinho.<eos> Was there a little ball on it too?<eos> I think it was too big for that.

There is a letter for you from Matthew.<eos> What?<eos> Where was it?<eos> Hidden in a book in the office and so it was overlooked.<eos> They finally got round to packing up his things and brought them here this morning.<eos> Who opened it?<eos> It wasn't sealed.<eos> But you've read it before me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I would have sent it to Murray to have it looked into but your grandmother insisted you should see it first.
Have we lost her?<eos> I'm so sorry I'm late.<eos> Never mind, never mind.<eos> Now I've got you all here, and before Carson comes in, I have something to say.<eos> I had a letter today from Murray.<eos> Wait just a moment while I finish.<eos> Shall I leave, my lord?<eos> No.<eos> You might as well hear this.<eos> Murray has taken Matthew's letter to various authorities and their conclusion is that it demonstrates testamentary intention.
That's a major typo.<eos> That says "Ice Clown."<eos> I'm just realizing now that's not a typo.<eos> Hey, aren't you his sister?<eos> I gotta get outta here.<eos> Good luck, Leslie.<eos> Here to accept the key to the city of Partridge, because Mr. Wyatt is conveniently ill, is his wife Leslie Knope.<eos> And it's water.<eos> Uhoh, the key was made of ice.<eos> And much like the hopes and dreams of the people of Partridge, it melted away.
Marty.<eos> Marty.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Just, uh, about tonight... I would be honored if you would do a reading in my wedding.<eos> Think kahlil gibran, you know?<eos> I even had a passage picked out.<eos> "Even as the strings of the lute are alone "though they quiver with the same music, it..." Think about it.<eos> So... okay.<eos> With this ring, I do commit myself to you as your everlasting lover.<eos> May it encircle your finger the way I will encircle you.
Thank you.<eos> Who knew the Porter brothers could pull off masks?<eos> That's exactly what I want to do is pull this thing off.<eos> Sometimes self-deception can be therapeutic.<eos> So can free grub.<eos> Who's coming with me?<eos> Can't have champagne wishes without caviar dreams.<eos> I heard about what you did for Amanda today.<eos> It's really wonderful.<eos> Just looking for justice where it's due.
That was a beautiful speech, Nana.<eos> Please don't tell people that Clay proposed, at least until I've made my mind up.<eos> Oh, you're so controlling for a liberal.<eos> I'll tell you later, but I just want you to know that I have some big news about me and Brice.<eos> Oh.<eos> Now Rocky and I are gonna get lit up.<eos> Come on, Nikki.<eos> Shania, look.<eos> A chocolate fountain right there.<eos> Let's stick a shrimp in there and see if it swims.
About time you got here.<eos> I'm a ten-year-old alone on a beach.<eos> Do you know how many modeling jobs I've been offered?<eos> We were so worried.<eos> Why did you do this?<eos> I wanted to show you that.<eos> I wanted to remind you why we came out here in the first place.<eos> Look, you can't see the end of it.<eos> We have a great life, Mom.<eos> I love our family the way it is.
It's in your wheelhouse.<eos> How did I get this reputation?<eos> Through repeated action.<eos> I got to take this.<eos> Does it pertain to this case?<eos> Not your business.<eos> Hey, I got your text.<eos> What's going on?<eos> You outed our suspect.<eos> I reported news as it came to me-- that's my job.
Dave, relaxi your taxi, 'cause I am gonna get you that spot if it's the last thing that I do... before getting myself a pizza and eating it in bed as a celebratory feast for getting you that spot.<eos> Team friendship!<eos> Team friendship!<eos> - Oh!<eos> Suh kyut!<eos> - Oh!<eos> Suh kyut!<eos> Okay, you have to get this dress.<eos> It's the one!<eos> I know but it is so expensive.
I'm not even talking about you.<eos> You think David's fat.<eos> You should definitely say something.<eos> This is not about you or David.<eos> Then I'm less interested.<eos> (sighs) I don't want to say something to someone, but by not saying something, it could mess up someone else's life.<eos> Who are all these anonymous people?<eos> I can't say.<eos> Further disinterested.<eos> Look, Rocky, sometimes you think the truth is going to hurt, but it ends up helping.
Impact in 5 seconds.<eos> We're out of options!<eos> But you don't know if...<eos> Impact!<eos> Report.<eos> Power levels at 12 % 19 % Increasing steadily.<eos> All decks reporting in.<eos> No casualties.<eos> Our torpedo broke off small pieces of the anomaly.<eos> The bulk is still intact, but it is no longer a viable threat.
I don't know why you always wait for me.<eos> There's no need.<eos> I want to be the first to greet you every morning.<eos> Well, as I said...there's no need.<eos> There's - There's every need.<eos> And I will keep it up until you explain to me what has gone wrong between us.<eos> Explain what?<eos> My life is perfect.<eos> And then, in the space of one day, it is nothing.
1979.<eos> Satellite detected a nuclear explosion in the South Atlantic.<eos> No country ever took responsibility.<eos> I invited CIA Operative Hanna here.<eos> On this one, she's one of us.<eos> So from the description and the fallout readings, we believe... This is one of the three bombs Sidorov acquired.<eos> Why would he detonate it?<eos> Proof that the bomb was functional.<eos> It would exponentially increase the value of those two remaining weapons.<eos> A nuclear bomb is as big as the fear it creates.
Did you offer sex in exchange for money?<eos> He certainly wanted it.<eos> But I said, you know, "we'll see."<eos> I meant that, you know, in time, if his treatment called for it... but I could see that he was ready to confront his intimacy issues.<eos> So, I took him from the downstairs den...<eos> You're doing this out of the house? !<eos> Um, what happened next?<eos> Oh, I took him to the room that I use for more confidential encounters.<eos> Please don't say my bedroom.<eos> Well i... it has a wonderful view of the canyon, honey.
Unclear.<eos> How should we proceed?<eos> We only need the girl.<eos> The mother's a liability.<eos> Get rid of her.<eos> Make it clean.<eos> It's okay, honey.<eos> I'm not gonna let them take you.<eos> I know.<eos> This car's faster than it looks.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system-- a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything... violent crimes involving ordinary people.
Must have been destiny.<eos> That's exactly what it was--<eos> Destiny.<eos> Listen, I gotta go run some errands this morning.<eos> I'll see you later on?<eos> They biting?<eos> Ah, nibbling.<eos> Did manage to, uh, hook a good-sized trout about an hour ago.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Where is it?
This can't go on.<eos> I realize that the socially acceptable amount of time to wallow in grief is coming to an end, and--<eos> That's not what I mean.<eos> You wallow as long as you need, but talk to someone.<eos> I feel like there are two types of people in this world, Rossi.<eos> The ones that get over their grief and move on and the ones that descend into some sort of endless misery.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> Give it time.<eos> How much time?<eos> I thought by coming to work every day and helping other people, the pain would lessen, but it hasn't.
Well, what if he was waiting inside the car?<eos> It's dark, they're not paying attention.<eos> He jimmies a door.<eos> But that would leave a mark.<eos> He didn't leave any marks.<eos> All right, well, let's go look at the other car.<eos> Hey, JJ, wait a minute.<eos> What?<eos> The car didn't lock.<eos> It beeped.
The car didn't lock.<eos> It beeped.<eos> But it's not making that locking sound.<eos> He's hacking the cars.<eos> That's how he's getting in.<eos> How we doing, baby girl?<eos> We are doing terrible.<eos> We have another one.<eos> My guys found the car 90 minutes ago.<eos> Make and model tells me it doesn't belong in the neighborhood.
Warlow.<eos> You can't vanish, old man.<eos> I've drained almost all your blood.<eos> Don't even try it.<eos> The fight's over.<eos> Are we not kindred?<eos> Yes, we are.<eos> My family and I, we lived beside yours for years when I was still fae.<eos> Just before you were born, I was turned.<eos> The darkness in me, it battles with the light every second of my being.
You pay my salary. You pay that of the nurse.<eos> You pay for the medicines.<eos> And if you had been willing to pay for pennies of insulin a day, or pennies of very cheap, inexpensive medications to manage their condition, you wouldn't be paying for their tens of thousands of dollars of care<eos> when they get really, really, really sick.<eos> [McGarry] Ultimately, when you see our waiting room, you see people suffering, when you see other human beings in our country suffering, you go, I just don't see how this equates to,<eos> at the end of a day, to business and money.<eos> And I sometimes wish I could share that with anyone who wants to talk about health care.<eos> Before we even debate about Republican or Democrat or Obamacare or not or whatever...<eos> wherever you stand on that, this notion of, look, at some point, it really is just about doing the right thing for somebody.<eos> [man] A lot of people have no idea what a county hospital is or even what it stands for or what goes on here.
You know, the whole "murdered his aunt," "socio" thing?<eos> Eh. He's here, and he's clearly not going anywhere.<eos> What are we all gonna do, hate him forever?<eos> Stop. Hostess.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Twirl it, swirl it, and knock it down.<eos> Hmm?<eos> Can I get one gin and tonic, bartender?<eos> Easy on the gin, heavy on the tonic.<eos> My tolerance isn't what it used to be.
Yeah?<eos> What do I got left to give?<eos> I know where Merlyn is keeping the device.<eos> It's in an abandoned subway station near Puckett Street.<eos> How do you know?<eos> That's where his wife was murdered.<eos> I need someone I can trust to deactivate the device.<eos> We have a mutual friend that I think could...<eos> Talk you through it.<eos> She says you care about the people of this city, that it needs you.

Why would you do that to my brother?<eos> April, put that down.<eos> I-I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> CLARK:<eos> Put the gun down, April!<eos> Why would you take him from me?<eos> DOMINIC:<eos> I didn't, I didn't do anything.<eos> OWEN:<eos> April... if you make this decision, it's gonna haunt you for the rest of your life.
That's true.<eos> Why I appreciate above all is his loyalty and strictness.<eos> Julia, will you bring the dessert?<eos> Hurry up, we're going to be late.<eos> My God, my hair looks awful.<eos> I don't like it this flat.<eos> I would like to have a shorter, sculpted cut.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Where's your grosgrain coat?<eos> It's not warm enough.
Don't try to find complicated reasons.<eos> The truth is he has an affair!<eos> In any case, it'd be recent.<eos> Who knows! Everything's possible!<eos> It wouldn't surprise me. He's an important man.<eos> Speaking of the devil...<eos> That's him.<eos> He forgot his keys again.<eos> Ladies. Excuse me, but a letter was mistakenly slid under my door.<eos> It's for you.
They came to us about eight years ago, and we formally adopted them five years ago.<eos> - Foster system sucks. - Jesus...<eos> [Mariana] He's right.<eos> It kind of does.<eos> - [Lena] Ok. - What happened to your face?<eos> - Get in a fight? - [Lena] Uh...<eos> Callie's kind of had a rough day.<eos> So, how about we cool it with the third degree.<eos> Is there... where's the bathroom?<eos> Yeah, it's right through there.
I was to deliver the most killer joke ever written.<eos> I, a kid, was supposed to tell Mr. Belvedere, a grown-up, to stay-- [Laughs]<eos> Oh!<eos> Even now, I can't get it out.<eos> All:<eos> Stay in there and think about what you did.<eos> Wow.<eos> Yolanda, way to take a bulletproof joke and shoot it right in the face.<eos> 87 takes I did before I was canned.<eos> My career was over before it even started.
I did, but I didn't want... this.<eos> Not again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why did you come here?<eos> I want to help you.<eos> You-you adopted a fake persona, you seduced me, faked your own death... so, forgive me if I, uh... if I don't want any more of your help.<eos> Would you have preferred I'd just killed you?<eos> Yes.<eos> I knew that my death would be quite a blow.<eos> I knew it would keep you occupied while I... carried on with other projects, but I... I failed to predict your descent into addiction.
So, might be Simms had help.<eos> Who's this woman?<eos> She's in every trial photo.<eos> She was a trial groupie.<eos> Showed up every day, never took her eyes off Simms.<eos> Was obsessed with him.<eos> Why?<eos> What do you see?<eos> Her earring.<eos> It looks exactly like the earring
Oh, God, it's one of the ghost hunters.<eos> Your infrasound can't explain that.<eos> Yeah, it's Hodges.<eos> We need help.<eos> So... it looks like she was sitting there, in front of the shrine.<eos> Killer surprised her, maybe.<eos> Hit her as she turned around.<eos> The bat was here already.<eos> You remember?<eos> It was part of the toy collection.
You don't sneak up on a man with a hook for an arm.<eos> Yeah, but I've got an emergency.<eos> My wagon wheel just snapped coming into town.<eos> - My cabbage is all over the road!<eos> - Can't it wait, Mildew?<eos> I've got to get these archives over to the great hall.<eos> But my cabbage, Gobber!<eos> What ever happened to customer service?<eos> All right.<eos> Hmm... wha... You touch that dagger and I'll show you how well it works.
So, is it true they call you girls who work the cordite<eos> "Powder Puffs"?<eos> Yeah or "Canaries."<eos> That's on account of how if you're not careful, the chemicals can stain our skin--<eos> "... a lovely shade of yellow..."<eos> Mrs. Shannon, I've asked you to stand back.<eos> I'm back, I'm back.<eos> Your matron sure takes her job seriously.<eos> It's a dangerous place to work.<eos> So if the cordite turns your skin yellow, what do you think it does to your insides?
Well, it's so sweet.<eos> It's about how beautiful I am inside and-- score!<eos> Jewelry<eos> Whoa!<eos> Check it out!<eos> Oh, look at that.<eos> Your grandma loved pocket watches.<eos> - Aw! - She said they made a man look dignified.<eos> Is this chain in case you swallow it?<eos> No, but suddenly I'm glad it's there.
I had done my basic training in Pensacola.<eos> She was my first.<eos> I'll never forget her-- Charlotte somebody.<eos> I was 18, and she was 31.<eos> And we fell pretty hard for each other.<eos> I always felt bad I never called her when I got back from Vietnam.<eos> Especially because by then I had, you know... learned a few things.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You'll have to forgive me.<eos> My memory isn't what it used to be.
We're gonna stake out a character in a video game? Yeah, we find out when he plays and who he eliminates next... could tell us who he's going to kill next.<eos> Virtual stakeout.<eos> I had it in my attic, part of my great-grandfather's collection, and I just thought, you know, it looked like it belonged here.<eos> It's a Gustav Becker double weight vienna, around 1870.<eos> Case is superb walnut.<eos> You know, Becker got his big breakthrough in 1852, at the Silesian clock fair.<eos> He won the gold medal for best design.<eos> You sure you want to give it to me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do. It'll feel right at home here.
The trailer.<eos> He's gotta be in the trailer.<eos> - What trailer?<eos> - Aunt Marie's trailer?<eos> Uh, well, I'm not really sure whose trailer it might have been under the ownership of... you know about it?<eos> Probably no more than you.<eos> What's aunt Marie's trailer?<eos> Old books, bottles, drawings... that's where I was the night all of this started.<eos> I feel like I'm so close to remembering.<eos> Do you know where it is? Huh?
Just checking to see if the Borealis made the conversion to paperless.<eos> Well, fourth fleet made the switch two months ago, which means, if the tablet's connected to a network, we can search its MEID.<eos> I guess your engineers trump my Buckeyes.<eos> - Go, Bucks!<eos> - Speaking of college, our missing tablet is online at John Hamilton University.<eos> Go.<eos> Tablet computers are like student loans around here.<eos> You sure you can track this thing?<eos> Within 50 yards.<eos> But since it just dropped off the cellular net, I'm gonna have to wait for it to reconnect.
Obviously they're attracted...<eos> Where is that in the data?<eos> I don't need data.<eos> I saw him try to pull her into a janitor's closet.<eos> Just because you can't reduce it to a number doesn't mean it doesn't exist.<eos> "It," meaning what, uh...chemistry?<eos> Something that can't be explained or quantified? That...<eos> Yes, that spark.<eos> Attraction has to play into how a... how a couple moves through the stages of sex.<eos> It has to.
So you don't remember what it used to feel like when we would dance?<eos> When my hand would touch your waist?<eos> Nope.<eos> How about this...<eos> When our fingers would touch?<eos> Nothing.<eos> And this?<eos> What heart?<eos> So how do I look?<eos> You look like a backstabbing bi... the dress is beautiful, and it brings out your eyes.
Unless you want us to deal you in, Mr. president.<eos> Well, I do like poker.<eos> Okay, I've updated my relationship status to:<eos> "Exclusive for life with princess Abigail of Andorra."<eos> - Oh my goodness. - You're hilarious. - No, stop.<eos> Ernesto, we're going to make that stop we discussed.<eos> So can you shake the security detail?<eos> Wait, what's happening?<eos> Skippy, be a lamb and hand me my valise.<eos> Is it in this bag?
I can't hang the doors.<eos> I've explained this.<eos> They sent the wrong doors with the kit.<eos> - And until this dispute is...<eos> - Nelson.<eos> You buy the house that comes in the boxes.<eos> You put it together with the hammer and the saw.<eos> I just followed the instructions.<eos> You're smart and you're strong.<eos> But it is a house still.
Oh, Marge.<eos> Come to the garage.<eos> You know it'll be good 'cause I'm saying it in a singsong fashion.<eos> It's a snuggle dungeon.<eos> Hey, Homer, can I get back my...<eos> What does this do?<eos> Now, just relax.<eos> Sit down...<eos> Not in that chair!<eos> It has no bottom!
Yeah. You go in first, and I'Il go in a minute.<eos> Oh, this is amazing!<eos> You dirty girl.<eos> Peter, I haven't left yet.<eos> You sick whore.<eos> Look, it'd just be temporary, Lois.<eos> Just for a bit, just till we get the farm back on its feet.<eos> Till we get our family back on its feet.<eos> I don't know...<eos> Lois, we've always given our family whatever it needs.
No, we haven't.<eos> The Moment is gone.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> What is the Moment?<eos> I've never heard of it.<eos> The galaxy eater.<eos> The final work of the ancients of Gallifrey, a weapon so powerful, the operating system became sentient.<eos> According to legend... it developed a conscience.<eos> And we've never used it?<eos> How do you use a weapon of ultimate mass destruction when it can stand in judgment on you?
I'm the Doctor.<eos> I'm 904 years old.<eos> I'm from the planet Gallifrey in the constellation of Kasterborous.<eos> I am the oncoming storm, the bringer of darkness, and you are basically just a rabbit, aren't you?<eos> OK, carry on - just a...general... warning.<eos> DING!<eos> Doctor!<eos> Elizabeth!<eos> That thing...explain what it is!<eos> What does it want of us?
I don't know many people.<eos> Yes, but in time, you'll make friends.<eos> Everyone dreams of a great life...<eos> It's hard at first.<eos> It just takes time.<eos> - Ever seen the cathedral?<eos> - No.<eos> On your right, just there.<eos> Do you see?<eos> Beautiful, isn't it?
I did all this for her.<eos> No, no, I-I'm a terrible judge of these things.<eos> Y-You need to take a beat and...<eos> I don't want to take a beat, okay?<eos> I sit here every day, confronted with death.<eos> JT, life is short.<eos> - I want to tell her.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Life is not short.<eos> It's very long, especially now that you got your-- our creature.
Some other guy jumped me,<eos> I had to defend myself.<eos> He took the fall for us.<eos> Well, it's the least I could do.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Okay, this is so weird.<eos> It's... you guys can hear each other and you're not even on speakerphone.<eos> VINCENT:<eos> Hey, Gabe, how long does the pill last for?<eos> Well, I know for me, uh, with my resistance, it lasts four hours, tops.
Argh!<eos> Argh!<eos> Help!<eos> Get the beast out before it cleaves me in two!
How I am your friend, Mr Reid.<eos> Mr Best. I wonder, have you ever met Mr Urwin?<eos> I have not had the pleasure, sir.<eos> But I am an admirer of your work.<eos> Mr Urwin is perhaps the last remaining night-soil man of this parish.<eos> Good evening to you, inspector.<eos> Hop it, Jimmy.<eos> We must assume his female captors to have forced this retraction of his opposition to Miss Cobden.<eos> How this city continues to evolve.<eos> It's a novelty, yes, but her reputation grows.
They brew that up, every single one of them's dead within a half-hour.<eos> There's some things I need.<eos> Hurry, man!<eos> "When flowers will be begot within flowers, "then will the Yuga come to its end."<eos> As foretold, the hour of reckoning is upon us.<eos> Where you ascend to this day, know that your brothers, sisters and Father follow.<eos> To take this glittering cup is to split asunder the chains of this world.<eos> When my daughter took her brave steps into the light...<eos> I understood at last that I was but an instrument of that light.<eos> It beamed from a world which called upon all those with faith and wisdom to give themselves unto it.
No no, don't don't... don't write anything down.<eos> Joe, I'm merely suggesting that whatever your feelings for Aunt Mel are...<eos> They may be stronger than you're willing to admit.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think you're very lucky you're not in my home school, because you would be flunking psychology right now.<eos> I can see you this time again on Thursday.<eos> Ewe ewe!<eos> No.<eos> I'm not... no.<eos> Now for a perfect crust, you want to make it not too thin, but even.
I was reading about this jellyfish that never dies.<eos> Instead, it reverts to its asexual state and then grows up again.
At ease, Officer Bellocq.<eos> Commissioner... he's dead.<eos> Preliminary investigation indicates it was a clean shooting in a difficult situation.<eos> In my book, that makes you a hero.<eos> Well done.<eos> I've been in your shoes, all right?<eos> I'm good, Commissioner.<eos> I'll be back in the street in no time.<eos> No, you'll be back when you're ready.<eos> Okay, heal this wound properly, or it will show up in places you've never expected, and it could take years to heal.
Is Sandy Larkin involved in this most recent vehicular tragedy?<eos> She's a person of interest.<eos> Interesting.<eos> I want in.<eos> I-I can't believe this.<eos> Y-You really think someone would do something to hurt Burt?<eos> Kill him.<eos> Burn him alive.<eos> So, Miss Larkin, we found your I.D. in Burt's car.<eos> Do you have any idea how it got there?
Actual wolves are known to track their prey by up to a hundred Miles a day by scent.<eos> A trained hunter can use scent to track them.<eos> If the wind is with them, wolves can track a scent by a distance of two Miles, which means we can draw them to us... Or into a trap.<eos> Full moon does give us one advantage.<eos> They'll have a higher heat signature, which makes them easier to spot with infrared.<eos> Thanks, but I've got my own.<eos> Just remember, we're not hunting wild animals.<eos> Underneath those impulses are two intelligent human beings.<eos> Don't think they can't rely on that human side.<eos> It's suppressed, but it's there, reminding them how to mask their scent, how to cover their tracks, how to survive.
- It's gonna be okay, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Those guys downstairs, they've done this thousands of times.<eos> Captain Mahoney.<eos> Tactical wants an update.<eos> Well, lack of access is limiting our options.<eos> What'd you find out about that handheld remote he had?<eos> It definitely activated the bomb.<eos> Good news?<eos> Tech thinks it could deactivate it as well.
Why so moody, Han?<eos> Are you man-struating?<eos> Is it that time of the man-th?<eos> That shop was our dream, Han, and this is just a dumb diner.<eos> - You're fired.<eos> - Ooh! I'm fired?<eos> Max, Han just fired me.<eos> You lucky son of a whore.<eos> I'm serious, Caroline. You called my diner "dumb."<eos> Well, at least my diner's still open and successful, whereas your cupcake shop was so dumb, it failed.
# I need to be where you are #<eos> # I need to be where you are #<eos> # Hey, you, look around # # can you hear that noise?<eos> #<eos> # It's a rebel sound # # we got nowhere else to go # # and when the sun goes down and we fill the streets #<eos> # You're gonna dance till the morning to the rebel's beat #<eos> # You can take everything from me #<eos> # 'Cause this is all I need #<eos> # You know that life is like a ticking clock #<eos> # Nobody knows when it's gonna stop, yeah #
It's a joke.<eos> Of course.<eos> What's your thought?<eos> I think Amanda might be making a play for the Black Box.<eos> You mean like another trade?<eos> Nikita for the box?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Or she's got a mole inside that could use the distraction to steal it outright.<eos> Impossible.<eos> It's in Ryan's safe with a biometric lock, and considering Ryan's condition right now,
You know what word they're starting to toss around?<eos> "Genius."<eos> Well, that's nice, but I don't think it's ready yet.<eos> The gazpacho is ready.<eos> Uh, we'll be right there.<eos> Odessa, who's that guy having lunch with Alejandro?<eos> His agent, Jackson Narino.<eos> He's slimy, but very important.<eos> Did you finish the salad?<eos> Two hours ago. It's in the fridge.
This hotel is falling apart.<eos> I can't manage on my own.<eos> I know all about staff problems.<eos> My parents had a café near Joinville. The mussels-and-chips type.<eos> Joinville?<eos> I thought you were a Northerner.<eos> I was originally.<eos> And then we moved south.<eos> Tell me about the café.<eos> It was next to the old film studios.
Well, the client list holds a lot of power -- blackmail, revenge.<eos> Georgia, do you think it was Carlyle?<eos> It's possible.<eos> Carlyle has been after the Rub clients for a while.<eos> He even made me an offer to buy the spa.<eos> Wait.<eos> He what?<eos> Yes, and I immediately turned him down, of course.<eos> And the client list is safe, isn't it?<eos> It's safe.
Thank you for the courtesy, Donovan, and, yes, there's definitely an attraction.<eos> I just don't know if I'm ready to pursue it.<eos> I barely know her and I'm just not that sure if celebrities and regular people mix all that well.<eos> Is it because of all the things the press says about Lindsay?<eos> You can't believe everything you read.<eos> They said I stabbed a guy 100 times.<eos> I stabbed him maybe 50 at the most.<eos> Liars.<eos> The newspapers accused me of assault with a deadly weapon.<eos> It wasn't deadly.
- I had pie!<eos> - How many pieces? - I don't know!<eos> How many pieces are in a pie?<eos> All right, I can fix this.<eos> I'm gonna have to touch your butt now.<eos> That's how Ryan and I met.<eos> All right, just arch your back.<eos> The clasp... I just gotta get...<eos> Okay. Now, I'm just gonna get the zipper.<eos> - It's never gonna zip.
And, as we make our way out of the gourmet kitchen, we find ourselves back in the warm embrace of the parlor.<eos> Easy ***. It's just one room, not *** Park.<eos> Where'd you get all this sweet furniture?<eos> Oh, we rented it to make the house feel more comfortable and inviting.<eos> Don't sit there!<eos> Oh, my gosh. It took me 20 minutes to get these chops just right.<eos> There. Does that look straight?<eos> Nothing about that looks straight.<eos> I love the house.<eos> It's beautiful.
But don't worry.<eos> I didn't. That's a relief.<eos> I was afraid I was gonna have to look at 'em.<eos> So you work at the museum?<eos> Oh, no. I'm just on the board.<eos> I run the art and antiquities department at Christie's.<eos> Oh. Let me see. What is the word I am looking for?<eos> Oh, yes. Bam!<eos> So how did you two meet?<eos> I won a car in a poker game, but it caught on fire, so the guy gave me a painting.
No.<eos> Brief you?<eos> Only the headlines.<eos> Any idea what this "new" information might refer to?<eos> No. Shouldn't we be talking to state police?<eos> Mr. Bergin was the attorney of an alleged serial killer, which makes it FBI jurisdiction.<eos> Bergin was on his way to see Edgar Roy in prison when he was killed.<eos> Was the window down?<eos> The driver's window...<eos> was it down?
[ Buzzer sounds ]<eos> [ Vehicle door closes ]<eos> [ Gunfire ]<eos> [ Tires screech ]<eos> [ Dog barks ]<eos> [ Police radio chatter ]<eos> [ Indistinct conversations ]<eos> Rigby: You entered a house sealed by the FBI as part of an ongoing murder investigation.<eos> Only the door was sealed.<eos> It still is.
What kind of condition was he in before the scene?<eos> Look, I've been working with Vince my whole career, all right?<eos> We were like twins.<eos> Go on.<eos> Well, he said he had a buzz on per usual, but he was pretty drunk.<eos> I know I'm alive because he did the scene.<eos> I shouldn't complain, it's just that... It feels like I should've stopped him.<eos> Well, do you think him being drunk influenced his decision to do the stunt himself?<eos> It clouded his judgment, but the decision to do the stunt, that didn't come from Vince.<eos> Who'd it come from?
Of course we recorded you.<eos> What do you think?<eos> We're idiots?<eos> I want my lawyer now.<eos> That's your right, sir.<eos> And there goes millions of dollars up in smoke in a five-year death-penalty trial.<eos> His ego won't permit it.<eos> Just know-- the second you call an attorney and invoke your rights...<eos> I'll be arresting you for multiple murders in the first degree with special circumstances.<eos> And the video of your trip to the county jail will go straight to YouTube, where it will live until the day you die.
What happened to Brittany...<eos> I guess you'll just have to wonder about that.<eos> Which is more than Martin ever did.<eos> Hey!<eos> Finally!<eos> We got a new printer.<eos> You want me to put this where the old one was?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Right here.<eos> It goes right here.
Excuse me.<eos> I ordered before her.<eos> - Double-frap, no whip for Bill.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - And I ordered before him.<eos> - Be patient.<eos> - She says, as she drinks her latte.<eos> - I'm gonna go get some stevia.<eos> I'm gonna watch people who ordered after me get their coffee before me.<eos> Oh, I love your outfit. It's so cute.
Anyway, it was time well spent.<eos> You found something?<eos> Lestrade was right.<eos> Lawrence Pendry did kill his wife.<eos> I know exactly how he did it.<eos> HOLMES: 13 months ago, a neighbor heard the shot which took Mary Pendry's life at exactly 6:33.<eos> Yes, I know this. I know all of this.<eos> I just want to know what you found in that bastard's house.<eos> The primary reason you were never able to build a case against Pendry was that you could not find the murder weapon.<eos> I humbly submit that it was in the kitchen the entire time.
You stop!<eos> Hold on a second.<eos> He just said Joey never gave me up.<eos> No... He's right.<eos> I did say that.<eos> Which means you got no case.<eos> No, no, no, we have a deal in place, Mr. Reid.<eos> You said I could reject that offer even if I wrote down a statement... right?<eos> That's right, she did say that.<eos> Then consider it rejected.
What the hell is the matter with you?<eos> Don't you dare run away from me.<eos> Please, don't hurt me!<eos> I told you to wear the black dress.<eos> It's at the cleaners!
Any chance that he knew Beth?<eos> I've always believed he spotted Beth at one of her beauty pageants.<eos> Those things are a magnet for pedophiles.<eos> Mm.<eos> Do you think my guy also killed your victim?<eos> It's not likely.<eos> We're still getting some background on Darby right now, though.<eos> Well, keep me in the loop.<eos> I still keep a picture of Beth in my wallet.<eos> It'll stay there until I catch the bastard.
All of you!<eos> What is with everyone today?<eos> Everything started so good.<eos> Boy.<eos> My roommate.<eos> It was good, I'm not gonna lie.<eos> It was very good.<eos> But I can't date my dad.<eos> Look... life's messy.<eos> It kicks you in the ass.
Everything started so good.<eos> Boy.<eos> My roommate.<eos> It was good, I'm not gonna lie.<eos> It was very good.<eos> But I can't date my dad.<eos> Look... life's messy.<eos> It kicks you in the ass.<eos> That's right, I said "ass."<eos> But it does, it kicks you in the ass.
That is a smart move, not a suicide mission.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Unh!<eos> Come on!<eos> So where's the other way in?<eos> There is no other way in.<eos> You go through the guys with the guns, or you don't get in.<eos> They're smart enough to take over a city block.<eos> They're smart enough to find a secondary escape route.<eos> And if you're smart, you'll tell me where it is. Now!
It's one of the many things that make you so valuable to Division.<eos> Now, as for why you wished to end your life in the first place...<eos> I deserve it.<eos> It should have been me.<eos> Your relationship with Daniel created a security breach.<eos> I know I screwed up.<eos> I know I got him killed.<eos> But you have to learn to accept your own role in his death without suffering guilt.<eos> If you don't, that guilt will take root and grow.<eos> You will end up on the ledge again, and it will push you over.
Telling him would be sentencing him to death.<eos> And that is something even you can't live with.<eos> The world is about to see you for who you really are, Nikita, and there is nothing you can do about it.<eos> Even if I do this...<eos> Even if Michael lives...<eos> We'll never be together again.<eos> My life is over.<eos> No, silly.<eos> The President's life is over.<eos> Your life will go back to what it should be.
You guys have to do these groupons with me, keep me on track.<eos> Well, as the author of several dozen cries for help,<eos> I know a good one when I hear one.<eos> But we have to be fair.<eos> In the interest of conducting a civil discourse, the fat slob from Illinois has the floor.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now you guys remember Chase, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Super cool guy, vowed to ruin your life.<eos> Well, he said that my life is so pathetic that it is un-sabotagable.
Um, did you happen to see anyone in the kitchen that you didn't recognize?<eos> Yeah, you know, someone brushed past me.<eos> Uh, I didn't get a good look, but I remember thinking that he wasn't familiar.<eos> Can you describe him?<eos> Not really.<eos> He was short, dark hair, maybe.<eos> Uh, things move fast in the kitchen, so I only caught him out of the corner of my eye.<eos> Tell me about that back door.<eos> Is it always open?<eos> - I-it shouldn't be. - Hey.
I've been through his financials.<eos> There's nothing there.<eos> Might be something a lot more personal.<eos> I canvassed the preschool that Cory's daughter attends.<eos> A teacher recognized him when I showed her the screengrab.<eos> Remembers seeing him hanging around the school the day before.<eos> So you think he threatened to hurt the daughter if Cory didn't poison the food?<eos> It might explain why he was so upset when he got to the restaurant.<eos> Where are we on ballistics?<eos> Slug from the crime scene is pretty mangled, but it's a possible match to another one in the system.
What does a Mexican solar company have to do with Eric Vaughn?<eos> He owns it.<eos> In fact, the night that Arthur Felder was poisoned, he and Eric Vaughn were arranging a site visit to the company because Felder wanted to double-up his investment.<eos> So whatever's going on, it has to involve this company.<eos> Yeah, but, Beckett, there's more.<eos> The person who authorized the wire transfer into Cindy's account was Eric Vaughn.<eos> It looks like he's behind this whole thing.<eos> That can't be right.<eos> Yo. I just got off the phone with the consulate in Tijuana.<eos> This company--Mexisolar-- it doesn't exist.
Because sometimes they sting you for those.<eos> Do they? Yeah.<eos> I'll get on to it.<eos> Hello?<eos> These biscuits in the room, are they free? They are?<eos> Yes!<eos> Good!<eos> Yeah, my life is going pretty well at the moment.<eos> I mean, overall, my life is shit.<eos> It started off badly and I'm pretty sure it's going to end badly, but certainly at the moment I'm on an absolute high.
When you're ready, sir.<eos> Good, thank you.<eos> Um, oh! Is there a problem?<eos> No, I...<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> Er...<eos> Val Kilmer.<eos> Yes, sir, yeah.<eos> See this watch?<eos> It's worth thousands of dollars, as far as you know.
He's worked for me for ten years.<eos> He wouldn't just disappear like this.<eos> When did the call come in?<eos> - Dispatch got the call about 2:30 yesterday afternoon.<eos> Al was already on the road at that point.<eos> Guy had a weird accent.<eos> Here's the call.<eos> - Ab towing. - I need some help.<eos> My car is troubled.<eos> It seems to have died.
I need you to tell me anything you can remember about your last call.<eos> Um, do you remember if he was wearing a hat?<eos> He sure was.<eos> I mean, I remember that most.<eos> It was a top hat, like Lincoln wore, and...<eos> Well, that and a lot of pain.<eos> It felt like my head was being crushed.<eos> And, um, what about the car?<eos> It was a '73 buick centurion.<eos> Supposedly it didn't start. When I tried, it did.
Is he ready to join our cause?<eos> He is.<eos> He has many reasons to hate Rome.<eos> And does he fully understand what will be required? More than that.<eos> He relishes it.<eos> I believe I have found a way, Holy Father, to bring you some peace of mind.<eos> Go on. You fear treachery.<eos> Now, a compromised man cannot plan treason.<eos> The sword hangs above his head day and night;<eos> he never knows when it may fall.
The more he steals from him, the more he lies to him, the more Leonardo loves him.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Why?<eos> That's why.<eos> The King of France, my lord.<eos> Your Highness!<eos> So. Ludovico's alive.<eos> His Army is intact.<eos> His army is no longer what I call an army.<eos> It's scattered.
Tears of blood?<eos> And then the earth exploded.<eos> Thank the Lord you were spared!<eos> Thank God, indeed!<eos> A false shroud.<eos> One has to admire her invention.<eos> If it is hers.<eos> You think there is another hand involved?<eos> She has a dark shadow.<eos> It has crossed us twice, now.
You can read this?<eos> These are all numbers.<eos> Each one of them has to mean something different.<eos> It must be a code.<eos> A book code, I think.<eos> - Where did you find this?<eos> - You do not need to know.<eos> - I'm afraid I must!<eos> - The letter, my lord!<eos> What does it say?
You seem curious.<eos> We have a treasure here.<eos> Just the scrapings of the earth.<eos> From where?<eos> We collect gravel, shale.<eos> Sell it where we can.<eos> Hebrews?<eos> You would sell the very soil if you could.<eos> Does soil have any value?<eos> Does it burn?
If we weaken now, they destroy us.<eos> I will carve you out an empire.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Rome is no longer the Borgia Pope alone.<eos> Rome is Cesare Borgia also.<eos> [♪] ♪ The Borgias 3x10 ♪ The Prince Original Air Date on June 16, 2013<eos> I have no servants when here in Rome, my lord.<eos> Florence can no longer afford them.<eos> Ah, democracy, Senor Machiavelli.<eos> They say it has its merits.
So you would be pope one day.<eos> Carve us out a kingdom, Cesare.<eos> And be both king and pope.<eos> You saw what happened to Colonna, so you know the rules.<eos> We knew them already, my lord.<eos> Good.<eos> Never presume that I will not act on my worst instincts.<eos> Or that it is not in your best interests to stay loyal to me.<eos> We have an army here.<eos> It is well stocked, powdered at last.

CSU hasn't finished processing it yet.<eos> This is a murder scene.<eos> I'm gonna need to find out who the victim was--<eos> I'm sorry, but that vehicle's part of a federal investigation.<eos> And if you people hinder us in any way, we'll arrest you for obstruction.<eos> What the hell's going on here?<eos> And why is Homeland Security involved?<eos> I don't know.<eos> This whole thing stinks.<eos> According to witnesses, those two guys were staking out the car even before it blew up,
You know, one of the perks of working for an 800-pound gorilla.<eos> Did you already interview him?<eos> You're the reason we got him, Detective Beckett.<eos> Why don't you do the honors?<eos> Look at that...<eos> How she uses the silence.<eos> She's a force to be reckoned with.<eos> Oh, you don't know the half of it.<eos> Omar, right now, your bags are being searched for a USB drive.<eos> Your best bet is to tell me the truth before it turns up.
All the public want is a happy marriage at the Palace.<eos> Is it so much to ask?<eos> And anyway, why did Mrs Dudley Ward have the letter in her handbag?<eos> I expect it was a love thing.<eos> It won't be much of a love thing when it's in the American papers.<eos> Do you think that's why he took it?<eos> Sampson took it to make money.<eos> The question is whether he means to blackmail Mrs Dudley Ward or sell it to the foreign press.<eos> No wonder she was in such a state.<eos> I can't tell you what it said.

I'm sorry...<eos> Rod, but I am feeling a little bit ganged up on here.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, Nancy.<eos> Uh, Alicia, Cary, could just one of you...<eos> - argue?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> The employee handbook is unambiguous, Rod.<eos> Company-issued equipment is subject to monitoring at all times.<eos> Yes.<eos> And if the company combed through every e-mail and Web chat that it monitored, they'd find other violations, too, but they haven't.
Are you here to see David Lee, or...?<eos> No, I... I just saw him, thank you.<eos> Actually, I was looking for you.<eos> Is there something I can help you with...<eos> Veronica?<eos> Yes, as a matter of fact, there is.<eos> Do you love my daughter?<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> - Because if you do, it's time to stop being polite about it.<eos> You have a window, but it's closing.
Well, with the draft coming up and all this money at stake, that's a lot for an 18-year-old.<eos> If baseball pays me a lot of dough, that's awesome, but I'm in it because I love the game.<eos> The mound is the -- it's the one place I feel happy.<eos> Are you happy here, at the Academy, away from home?<eos> You kidding?<eos> It's the greatest thing that happened to me.<eos> I've spent four years at V3.<eos> Connor and Troy have given me everything I need to reach the dream, and now I'm gonna blow it over something this stupid.<eos> Hey, Hutch, fear of flying is not an uncommon phobia.<eos> And luckily, it's one of the easiest to tackle...
Go to hell!<eos> Move it!<eos> Barbie! Barbie... get ahold of yourself.<eos> Can I count on you?<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> All right, this thing is starting to spread.<eos> We need to do something, and fast.<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing?<eos> We know that you still got meat in that freezer of yours.<eos> Yeah. And it doesn't belong to either of you.
I said I'd like to be alone.<eos> Leave me alone, Joe!<eos> I wonder where Ollie went.<eos> Guess he figured discretion's the better part of valor.<eos> Just like I thought.<eos> Carter, secure the well.<eos> Well, now.<eos> That didn't take long.<eos> You're trespassing on private property.<eos> It's not private anymore.
But I have a right to defend my property.<eos> And that freak, he was banging on my door.<eos> What freak?<eos> At my house.<eos> He's still inside.<eos> Weird-looking guy showed up, ranting that he had to hide from the voices coming from the dome.<eos> I said I had a gun, but he wouldn't leave, so I fired off a couple shots to scare him off.<eos> Except you hit your neighbor.<eos> And that freak didn't even run off.<eos> This thing started off by killing people, and now it's just driving the rest of us crazy.
Well, there are teeth behind the smile.<eos> It's the only way to get things done.<eos> Like the propane, you mean?<eos> My daughter tells me everything.<eos> Gave me every bit of evidence I need on you and Duke, that nutty Reverend Coggins.<eos> So... she must have told you about Barbie, too, huh?<eos> About him breaking legs.<eos> Killing that Dr. Shumway.<eos> It's no surprise he got stuck here.<eos> This town... it always has been a magnet for the worst of humanity... like your son.
Skipping the beer and on to the rye, huh?<eos> I'm sorry about your friend.<eos> Thanks, but, uh...<eos> Nicole told me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm gonna miss him.<eos> He worked here?<eos> He did.<eos> I don't know why death still surprises me.<eos> 'Cause we know it's coming, but we still don't know when it's coming.
I beg of you, Godric, please, can you... just give her one more chance like you-- like you've done before?<eos> It was you who gave it to me.<eos> You-- you who saw something in me, found me.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> ( crying, laughing )<eos> Of course I remember it.<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> You look pale.<eos> Paler than usual.<eos> The plague, it has made food scarce, as you can imagine.
"Patent the sex whisk."<eos> It wasn't a pretty dress.<eos> It looked like something you'd bury Snow White in.<eos> The only reason you didn't like it is because I picked it out.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I spent two weeks trying to help this little...<eos> Daughter of ours buy a dress for Junior Prom.<eos> Carter McGarry asked me to go and he's really cute.<eos> Do you see anything wrong with a dress like this?<eos> No, no, it's great if you want to wear a pile of napkins covered in glitter barf.
All I wanted was to stop for coffee.<eos> I was willing to treat.<eos> No one eats or drinks in my car.<eos> Well, I guess sex is out of the question.<eos> For...<eos> Your car rides really stiff.<eos> My car rides fine, Tony.<eos> You were in an accident.<eos> My Cadillac is like a cloud.<eos> It's roomy and soft.
Brought back your plunger.<eos> You've had it for two years.<eos> Why now, DiNozzo, in the middle of the night, you have a burning desire to return my plunger?<eos> It's just an excuse to talk to you about something.<eos> After all these years, you need an excuse?<eos> I'm worried about Ziva.<eos> Why?<eos> How about she let me use her car?<eos> Which is actually pretty good.<eos> It drives better than you'd think, and it's pretty roomy on the inside.
Bye.<eos> Take care.<eos> Um, you kicked some serious ass in there.<eos> No, I think he was talking about you.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> They were hanging on every word that you were saying, so...<eos> Oh, and what, with, you know, that accent and whatnot?<eos> Okay, you have to shut up right now.<eos> That was a terrible accent.<eos> Okay, well, I apologize that you have too much self-loathing to recognize a good thing even if it, you know, slaps you in the face.
It's fine.<eos> I was just leaving.<eos> Not sure I had any luck knocking sense into your dad.<eos> Hope Yvonne did better with you.<eos> I had him, Jack.<eos> Right there, dead to rights.<eos> I couldn't pull the trigger.<eos> I wanted to, but... I couldn't do it.<eos> 'Cause that's not how I raised you.<eos> Hope this meeting is as important to me as it is to you.

I mean, yeah, he's not the sort of guy I've gone out with in the past, But I believe I can change.<eos> Yeah, and I'm sure that I can change, too.<eos> I used to only be into super controlling girls, but now--<eos> Hey, what did I say about talking too much?<eos> Nolan, you don't have to listen to her.<eos> You can talk.<eos> I don't know about this, charlie.<eos> I feel a little creepy installing a tracking program On our daughter's phone.<eos> Look, if we're replacing her phone, we might as well.<eos> It's like when they tag a giraffe so they can see where it migrates, What it eats, and most importantly, To make sure it doesn't mate.
Yeah, blud, I know, innit.<eos> As long as it's quick.<eos> Can you just please make that happen for me, please, Rafe...<eos> Yeah, call me.<eos> Yeah, call me when you do, yeah?<eos> All right, cool... see ya.<eos> When's he gonna have it?<eos> When he sells the car, innit.<eos> Look, why don't you just take the car then, Sully, yeah?<eos> It's worth 20, innit.

Well, Michael Stappord was negotiating a settlement on behalf of her assailant.<eos> For some reason we don't understand,<eos> Flora felt there was a connection between the father of her baby and the man who attacked her.<eos> Any thoughts you have will be greatly appreciated.<eos> Did you talk to him?<eos> He's agreed to a settlement.<eos> But only in exchange for a graceful end to this situation.<eos> Are you leaving?<eos> Oh, I've got a meeting.<eos> It starts in ten minutes, and it's in Burbank, which is 20 minutes away.
That's a street value of a dozen Porsches.<eos> Private meeting.<eos> Why don't you beat it?<eos> I said beat it.<eos> Move.<eos> You, too. I'll see you later.<eos> Well, we found a very large quantity of drugs in your vehicle, Santana.<eos> Yeah, well, I don't know how they got there.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> But being as it wasn't in your possession when we found it, legally we can't charge you.
You asked for everything we got on the jumper Noni.<eos> That's pretty thick.<eos> Well, with her man being Los Lordes, odds are she collected a little dirt herself.<eos> How much dirt?<eos> Uh, nothing too bad considering-- a few possession collars, discon, resisting.<eos> Not exactly OG material.<eos> Give me one second.<eos> Yeah, Dad.<eos> How's the noggin?<eos> Well, it took a licking but keeps on ticking.
Why are we here?<eos> Because the machine said this is where I'll find the answer.<eos> What was the question?<eos> Where the machine is located.<eos> Can't it just tell you?<eos> I think Finch programmed it not to, to protect it.<eos> No offense.<eos> Maybe Finch wants control of the machine himself.<eos> If Finch had something to do with the virus, I'm sure he had his reasons.<eos> On the upside, hopefully the machine won't have told Root where it is either.
I know it's a minor matter compared to the total and utter catastrophe<eos> I'm looking at here, but...<eos> I didn't think you'd turn traitor, Shaw.<eos> That's a strong word to be throwing around given where we're standing.<eos> What do you want?<eos> A word or two with your new friend.<eos> I always knew there was someone behind Ingram. Like a black hole.<eos> Invisible, but powerful.<eos> So tell me, where did you move the machine?<eos> It moved itself.

_<eos> You got an update for me yet, Finch?<eos> This is becoming your version of "Are we there yet," Mr. Reese, and no, we are not.<eos> It's been ten days since we got a new number.<eos> I'm working as quickly as I can.<eos> Well, work faster.<eos> I don't wanna find out what happens when that clock hits zero, do you?<eos> Not particularly.<eos> Can you tell me if we're ever gonna get another number, or has that virus destroyed your machine for good?<eos> I believe that the machine is still active, it's just unable to make contact.
Seems almost pointless.<eos> Maybe this company's a front for something else.<eos> Something less legal.<eos> _<eos> What did you do to it, Harold?<eos> There's no time to be coy.<eos> We both know the machine's under attack.<eos> What I don't understand is why a robust system with self-annealing properties isn't defending itself against a simple virus.<eos> Did you injure it, Harold?<eos> Is that why it can't fight back?
I've lost people before, so when I care about someone, I plant a tracking device on them.<eos> I can understand why you and Harold get along.<eos> Well, unless you've got some kind of plan to get me the hell out of here--<eos> This is the plan.<eos> - I'm this way.<eos> - I'm driving.<eos> No.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> _<eos> If the machine figured out that Decima was trying to hijack it, it must have created Thornhill as a defense mechanism.

So he raped you.<eos> No, he paid, just like anyone else.<eos> What, you want to feel sorry for me?<eos> That's an extra $20.<eos> After Lanten paid you, you see him leave?<eos> He got into the passenger side of a car.<eos> That's what pissed me off so much... is that he had someone drive him out here just so we wouldn't recognize his truck.<eos> What kind of car was it?<eos> Dark sedan.<eos> I'm pretty sure it had tinted windows.
Well, the cell phones have been off since we left, and GPS, too.<eos> Nothing traceable.<eos> I'm not hiding, DiNozzo.<eos> Nothing to hide from.<eos> Then why play Jeremiah Johnson?<eos> 'Cause we have things to talk about, and the less Parsons is privy to, the better.<eos> That's possum scat.<eos> Are you enjoying nature, Tony?<eos> Yes.<eos> I just don't like nature when it's all over my shoes.
Were their deaths absolutely necessary?<eos> Nothing I wouldn't do again.<eos> Please tell me you're not gonna say that in court.<eos> I won't be in court.<eos> All those people in all those cities.<eos> And somehow our troubles still find a way to matter.<eos> Mr. Parsons... kindly come out from behind my desk.<eos> We're a lot alike.<eos> Are we?<eos> We both believe in the law and what it's capable of.
Hello.<eos> Hello, Dad.<eos> I thought they'd never let us pass. - Plus, my suitcase came out last.<eos> - You look healthy.<eos> This is Revolucion.<eos> - You didn't get my letter?<eos> - What letter?<eos> - I wrote to you.<eos> - No, we didn't get anything.<eos> I thought it'd arrive in time.
I see who you really are.<eos> You're a good man, Pete Davenport.<eos> Why did you stop?<eos> Raquel, you are beautiful and stunning.<eos> Once upon a time I'd be gone all the way if I could ...<eos> I'll be a different man.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Yes ...<eos> - What's so important about the uniform?<eos> - It can give me my life back.
I'll be a different man.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Yes ...<eos> - What's so important about the uniform?<eos> - It can give me my life back.<eos> - Maybe I should find it first.<eos> - You gotta hit me and Oscar.<eos> Oscar?<eos> - I do not do Oscar angry.<eos> - Just tell me where it can be.
If you'd all backed me up... they'd have listened.<eos> They would have had to listen.<eos> I can't do this on me own!<eos> You're late.<eos> Overtime... with me... tonight.<eos> I'm not late!<eos> Oh, I say you are.<eos> It's nothing personal.<eos> I just go by the bell.<eos> Through the gate before it stops.
Can anyone else hear the bell?<eos> No need to hurry then.<eos> Crout?<eos> Knock 'em up at the apprentice house.<eos> What's going on?<eos> The bell's been sabotaged.<eos> Come on, put that down!<eos> You're late!<eos> Move it! It's not a playground!<eos> Nothing personal, but I go by the bell. Through the gate before it stops, isn't that the rules?
Here's the deal. - I need an MRI.<eos> - Why?<eos> It seemed pretty clear to me in the first two minutes that the guy is competent.<eos> Hell, he's downright articulate.<eos> You have more than enough to form an expert opinion. Exactly, expert.<eos> I'm the expert.<eos> And I'm not forming any opinion until I've thoroughly examined the subject.<eos> And to do that, I need an MRI.<eos> File this for me.<eos> The bullet bored through his Prefrontal Cortex like a power drill, but it completely missed his Optic Chiasm, his Trochlear Nerve, the Genu of the Corpus Callosum.
SUE: No, Rachel, I'm sorry.<eos> But the VP's schedule has skyrocketed since the interview.<eos> Actually, I'm not sorry.<eos> I'm not sure why I just said that.<eos> Boy, I'll tell you something.<eos> That TV interview was a big gamble, but it really paid off.
- They must be moving out.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Huh?<eos> [Gasps] Evan, it's beautiful.<eos> - Right?<eos> - [Giggles] I love it.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> But wait, wait, wait.<eos> Why are they moving furniture into the house?<eos> Maybe it rented already.
Hmm, I'm really busy.<eos> Keeping the place up I'm sure.<eos> Tess and I were talking last night about how great the house looks.<eos> Thanks, yeah.<eos> I've had to maintain it over the years, hoping to attract buyers however unlikely.<eos> Tough market.<eos> - Well, thanks for stopping by.<eos> - One quick question, Karen.<eos> When we were over for dinner,<eos> Tess noticed a photo of Tara, but it was gone by the time we left.
Because she'll never forgive me.<eos> Because you'll never forgive yourself.<eos> Okay, what is so important that we need to have an emergency hearing?<eos> Your Honor, we need to be heard before demolition starts.<eos> What's he going to do now, tell us about his first demolition?<eos> It was riveting, but this has nothing to do that.<eos> Your Honor, based on the new zoning put through for their project, we're simply asking for a revised valuation of the property that they're taking.<eos> $100 million?<eos> That valuation has no basis.<eos> It has a mathematical basis.
I'd love to be able to tell the lady who cuts my hair that I don't like bangs.<eos> I like your bangs.<eos> Oh, thanks, I like 'em, too.<eos> What else?<eos> Mm... it's kind of a tie between sending food back in a restaurant and saying no to those kids who sell magazines door-to-door.<eos> Mm, yeah.<eos> Those are both toughies.<eos> I know.<eos> I have a two-year subscription to Guns Ammo.<eos> I push my shoulder against the secret door to see if it gives way.
Let's go back out there.<eos> Y... Well, no.<eos> Hold on.<eos> My Elven magic-user and your half-orc warrior did have a love spell cast on them.<eos> We wouldn't really be playing the game right if we didn't see that through.<eos> Okay.<eos> I believe that, uh, we just killed a dragon.<eos> While the others pillage the corpse,<eos> I lead you to a secluded area where I attempt to remove your leather armor.<eos> It comes off.
- Pier 17.<eos> The Leviathan.<eos> You're gonna make it, Will.<eos> Hang in there.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> Far as they know, the car's not a crime scene, so all they need to see is your I.D. and they can run the registration.<eos> - The car's not mine.<eos> - What?<eos> It belonged to a guy named Randall Meade.
Now, everyone, lights out and quiet.<eos> It's... wait.<eos> I think it's... it's here.<eos> I got it.<eos> I got it.<eos> I have my finger on the leak.<eos> It's ventricular.<eos> Lights, please.<eos> If the ventilators stop working, then these babies die unless we manually bag them.<eos> Crystal's battery light has been on a while, so when it dies, you switch her baby over to manual ventilation calmly and quietly.
No.<eos> If you hadn't gotten to him first, I probably would have killed the guy.<eos> Why?<eos> Why would you do that for me?<eos> Shut up.<eos> Why wouldn't I?<eos> We try so hard to protect ourselves, but it doesn't make a damn bit of difference.<eos> 'Cause when the bad things come, they come out of nowhere.<eos> Whew. The storm is here.<eos> It's totally here.
Um...<eos> I, I can't remember.<eos> I don't think I ever knew.<eos> Mister Corcoran, if it please you, stay here.<eos> Sara and I, we'll we'll get your Missus ready for cooling.<eos> Back home, I have readied the dead for the next life.<eos> Excuse me, Robert.<eos> I'm not staying. I just wanted to thank you for the invitation to this evening's hanging.<eos> The invitation didn't come from me.<eos> It arrived this morning to the club. My wife remains your ardent supporter. For all her unfortunate instincts, she does sometimes recognize what is right.
In France, a simultaneous police raid is conducted at 2 independent Internet access providers, World-Net and France-Net.<eos> "Pornographic pictures of young children, National TV News bulletin 1996 The francenet case that's what the police found on the two incriminated networks.<eos> Both ISP managers have been indicted.<eos> We got them!<eos> The responsibles would then be those managing the pipes that transport the content.<eos> Just as if the postman was responsible for the mail he carries.<eos> Rafi Haladjian, founder of francenet, was one of the two CEOs arrested that morning.<eos> The issue with pedophilia is that it's an easy topic.<eos> Pedophilia is the only unambiguous topic...<eos> When you see a pedophile picture, you know it is pedophile and you can immediately decide to delete it.
- Beth, do you remember Laurie?<eos> - Yes. - Nice to see you.<eos> - You guys already said hello and... How are you?<eos> Good to see you.<eos> You guys want red wine?<eos> Yes. I would love red wine.<eos> - I've been cooking. I've been cooking. - How have you been?<eos> - I've been good. I've been really good. - You?<eos> - I've been great. Yeah.<eos> Life is looking very different from how it was a while back.
Which means that this Lee is not your wife.<eos> Are you with me?<eos> Well, there's more.<eos> Because Hugh and Amir... are from a third house.<eos> He just showed me his phone.<eos> Remember that dark area that we walked through?<eos> I have a feeling that whoever walks through that... is like they end up in the middle of a roulette wheel, and they will just end up somewhere by chance.<eos> And whoever walks through there... will not return to the house that they just left.<eos> And I think that we need to find our way back to our house before the comet passes... because we... once it...<eos> once it passes, we might just be stuck exact... here.
- What?<eos> For me?<eos> - Beautiful flowers for a beautiful sunrise.<eos> - Your husband do something bad?<eos> - No.<eos> You do something good?<eos> Shut up.<eos> Hey, Bob.<eos> - Where's the card?<eos> - Uh, it should be under the ribbon.

Lift.<eos> Lower ground floor.<eos> Emergency scan.<eos> Diagnosis:<eos> CVA.<eos> Cerebral vascular accident.<eos> Intensive care unit.<eos> Head down, legs in the air.<eos> What a night!<eos> The sequelae depend on the area of the brain and the functions it controls.
Remy, I thought you were coming back with coffee.<eos> I got a little busy.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'll walk you back.<eos> It was wet, not damp, okay?<eos> A puddle.<eos> Maybe there's a broken pipe or something.<eos> This is not about a broken pipe.<eos> Miranda, this house is old.<eos> I know, it's huge, it has its own weather, but this is not about bad plumbing, Caleb!
Once upon a time, in a magical land...<eos> An evil queen...<eos> I will not let them defeat me.<eos> Unleashed a powerful curse.<eos> The curse!<eos> It's here!
Thanks, Ryan.<eos> God, it feels so good to finally share that.<eos> I feel like I barely see you anymore.<eos> I've missed this. Hey!<eos> Jenna, Ryan! Hey, Margot.<eos> Nice work.<eos> What? I said, "Nice work."<eos> In your garden.<eos> Wait, hang on, I'll come over.<eos> Classic Margot-- couldn't hear death if it was knocking on her door.
What about that addict we talked to? Anthony Hicks?<eos> No, he's lawyered up, remember, he's done talking. Well, maybe he'll talk if we find him in the right state of mind. You know, he is self-medicating with a real-life truth serum.<eos> Wait, since when is heroin a truth serum? Some people are more open and forthcoming when their endorphins are flowing. Let's see if we can catch him while he's still high.<eos> Mr. Hicks?<eos> Mr. Hicks?<eos> Oh, geez.<eos> It's Moretti. I need an ambulance. Better make it the Coroner.<eos> Listen to this...<eos> Anthony Hicks' final status update.<eos> "War don't ennoble men. It turns them into dogs".
- You're on the front page.<eos> Delémont will have the deputy it deserves.<eos> They love gossip.<eos> Everyone's talking about you.<eos> You don't care about the TGV and the Jura's future!<eos> - How is it?<eos> - What?<eos> The photo.<eos> Great.<eos> - Is it in a national paper?
Wait, I don't have a sister.<eos> What is happening here?<eos> Look, I'm sorry.<eos> I just don't want to be left alone with my thoughts right now because I'm thinking of doing some things that I shouldn't.<eos> There's this widow who lives across the street.<eos> And she waters her lawn every morning wearing a bathrobe.<eos> This morning, she smiled at me and that bathrobe was open a little bit.<eos> She sounds like a real nice lady.<eos> I'm saying that I haven't had another woman in 40 years.<eos> If that woman waters her lawn tomorrow wearing that bathrobe and it pops all the way open.
She said be on your worst behavior. I'm on mine.<eos> I love it!<eos> Turn my birthday into a lifestyle.<eos> Okay, Issa, your turn.<eos> Well, I didn't get you a gift, so I guess I'm down.<eos> We did say.<eos> Bitch, I just said I was down.<eos> My bad.<eos> I was reading your eyebrows.<eos> They are very expressive.
- Shit. - Yup.<eos> But I'd have noticed, I'd have seen if somebody had followed me.<eos> How sure can you be?<eos> It isn't as if you were looking for it, is it?<eos> So, what you've gone and done, inadvertently - and I'm sure with the best of intentions... No...<eos> There was nowhere else to take her.<eos> Nowhere else had any space.<eos> What you've done is put that little old lady in there in a potentially very vulnerable and dangerous position.<eos> If it's who we think it is, these people don't muck about.<eos> If they think Ilinka's told us stuff that could compromise them - and she has - they'll kill her.

What, employing trafficked women?<eos> No, that's...<eos> The people who own it probably don't even realise they are trafficked, they probably were perfectly nice to her.<eos> The problem is...<eos> How can they not know?<eos> They don't pay 'em!<eos> No, they do!<eos> The biscuit factory does.<eos> What happens is the traffickers set themselves up as a legitimate employment agency.<eos> They don't go round advertising the fact that they're criminal scum, it's not written across their foreheads.

You might want to sit down.<eos> Oh, hello. I saw a dead body this morning.<eos> This fella hanged himself.<eos> You'll get used to it.<eos> I didn't mind.<eos> I was fascinated.<eos> His tongue was like... and his lips were blue, proper blue, and his eyes were all, like, bulging out.<eos> Does that make me weird?<eos> Not being freaked?<eos> Is it true that men get an erection when they hang?

Dare I say it, I'll be surprised if this isn't him.<eos> Have you had time to think through a media strategy?<eos> Yeah, the minute we're in a position to break the news...<eos> Did you fast-track that DNA swab they took last week?<eos> I did, yeah.<eos> Good. Yeah, the minute we're in a position to break the news,<eos> I want images of Vicky Fleming out there big time.<eos> On every news channel.<eos> I want the date that flat was burnt out seared into people's brains.<eos> I want people thinking back to that night, what they were doing that night.
Somebody...who'd upset you, obviously.<eos> I mean...<eos> The way she was strangled, it was...<eos> - Not like it was an accident, was it?<eos> - Vicky Fleming had John Wadsworth's number on her mobile phone.<eos> He accounted for it.<eos> He did an investigation at the building society three years ago when he was on the economic crime unit, and it isn't even like the number was ever used.<eos> Well, there you go, that's a perfectly reasonable...<eos> 'But people use secret shagging phones, don't they?<eos> That they could destroy.
Why?<eos> She told me her story.<eos> You know - yet another everyday story of country folk.<eos> Her dad.<eos> He interfered with her.<eos> Daryl was his son, not his grandson.<eos> She brought up this kid, this child, this... ..aberration.<eos> That she loved and hated because... what else could she do?<eos> And she was terrified of him finding out, so... she tried to stop him bothering with the local lads.<eos> So they picked on him.

Jumpers usually go face first.<eos> Yep. And this guy's got contusions around the face consistent with a fight.<eos> Probably pushed from the choir loft.<eos> Died on impact.<eos> No wallet, no ID, no phone.<eos> Could be a robbery or someone trying to make it look like one.<eos> I don't see any security cameras.<eos> Because they do not have any.<eos> St. Brigid's keeping private things private.<eos> Priest says congregants can come and go as they please.
You kiss her on your first date?<eos> Really?<eos> That's none of your business.<eos> What was the first thing you noticed about her?<eos> Her eyes.<eos> My boobs, liar.<eos> That's a start.<eos> Now let's get more specific.<eos> What about her eyes?<eos> They glowed.

Can I help you?<eos> Books.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Are you relatives of Mr. Nebojsa?<eos> No.<eos> Look, I'm here doing an appraisal on the property... [gasps]<eos> Oh!<eos> Where are the books?<eos> There aren't any books.<eos> They've all been taken.
You know, this Black Claw is getting to be a real dangerous pain in the ass.<eos> We... we can't go to the FBI, NSA, or the DA.<eos> At least HW knows what's going on.<eos> How much do you think a Grimm book is worth?<eos> You need some money?<eos> Monroe got a call last night from his uncle in Leipzig, Germany.<eos> He's a book dealer, and apparently he found some Grimm books.<eos> And he called Monroe at 3:30 in the morning to see if I wanted to buy them.<eos> I got some photos.<eos> They do look really old.
That's what the press is for.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> I mean, if he called us at 3:00 in the morning, he must have thought it was urgent, so why hasn't he called you back?<eos> [sighs] I don't know.<eos> Maybe he realized the books were fakes or something.<eos> But wouldn't he have called to tell you that?<eos> He could have found another buyer.<eos> Well, that would be a shame.<eos> Maybe you should try calling him again.<eos> He's probably just trying to establish how much they're worth, you know?
How did you get it?<eos> Did you kill him?<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> No, I... I am not violent, despite what just happened.<eos> No, these books belonged to Josef Nebojsa.<eos> He lived in Prague.<eos> He was very old.<eos> Uh, he died of natural causes.<eos> I was brought in to assess the books by an antiques dealer friend of mine.<eos> They were hidden in the attic of the house.

I should have destroyed them, probably, but I can't; they're too rare.<eos> It would be like destroying the Magna Carta or the original pages of Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales."<eos> I've devoted my whole life to the written word.<eos> I cannot be the one to erase any of them from the world.<eos> I've spent my entire life defending the imagination, the thoughts, and the passions of a writer who would commit these words to the page... ♪ ♪<eos> I am sorry.<eos> I get carried away.<eos> How much do you want for the books?<eos> Well, handling such material is very dangerous.<eos> But in spite of the fact that they are priceless, I will let you have them for $100,000.
You kidding me?<eos> My antiques dealer friend has already been killed.<eos> And whoever did it must know that I have these books.<eos> Here, you can keep the book I brought.<eos> I will contact you in 24 hours for your decision.<eos> Uncle Felix, that's a lot of money.<eos> It is the best I can do.<eos> There's no way I can pull together $100,000 in 24 hours.<eos> But if all the books look like this one...<eos> And what if they're destroyed?

Thanks.<eos> Your uncle had the books shipped.<eos> That's why he gave you 24 hours to think about it.<eos> We couldn't find a shipping order in the hotel room, and Felix would've needed that to pick up the books.<eos> These guys must have taken it.<eos> Got something on the car.<eos> Ford Expedition, rented in the name of Krisztian Ajandok.<eos> Hasn't been returned.<eos> Then they're on their way to get the books.<eos> The cargo company doesn't open up till 9:00 tomorrow morning, but they're not gonna wait for that.
Good afternoon.<eos> Today, we're gonna work to turn all of you bullies into buddies.<eos> What a nightmare.<eos> Now, who here has a personal story they'd like to share about a time they were bullied?<eos> This is for the students.<eos> Yes.<eos> Ms. Snap hates my drawings.<eos> What?<eos> That's not true.<eos> They're just not an accurate portrayal of my body.
- Power?<eos> Stature?<eos> If I could do something we would be sitting in our home instead.<eos> I've grown old banging one door after another.<eos> Answering to everyone's questions.<eos> I give a speech... and listen to their claps.<eos> I give more speeches and people applaud more.<eos> This...<eos> These newspapers...<eos> this news, they're useless.
- So I've heard.<eos> Human blood.<eos> Funny how those rules for Downworlders stop being such a big deal when you need our help.<eos> No can do.<eos> Okay, listen. Come on.<eos> Last night, I bumped into Bernice.<eos> She overheard a couple of bridge and tunnel vamps gossiping about Camille.<eos> You said Camille took a leave of absence, right?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, yeah.<eos> They didn't care about that.

You don't have to worry about me.<eos> I'll always worry about you.<eos> I want you to be happy.<eos> Then help me find Hook and get out of here.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> You need to leave... now.<eos> I promised my friends I would help.<eos> Your friends.<eos> Your family.<eos> They're what's holding you back.
It's okay, dear.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Is it?<eos> Am I really forgiven?<eos> Of course.<eos> I love you no matter what.<eos> That's what fathers do.<eos> I'm not sure they do.
Tell me your father's okay.<eos> He's better than okay.<eos> He's in a better place now.<eos> Wait.<eos> That means everyone here...<eos> Can be saved.<eos> Every soul in this town has unfinished business.<eos> And chances are, for a lot of them, we're that business.<eos> You've all deluded yourself if you think these people are worth your time.<eos> They're not the dearly departed.
Is that what you want?<eos> And you'll say you'll bring it here, but the real plan is to distract me from what is, I'm sure, an impressive law enforcement response just outside that door.<eos> Is that the plan?<eos> That's the plan.<eos> Ok, let's talk, but let's talk about something interesting, at least.<eos> Tell me about me.<eos> You?<eos> You're a black widow hitwoman.<eos> You specialize in seduction and you're patient.<eos> You learn everything you can about the men you're hired to kill, physically, psychologically, and emotionally, because you want them in as compromised a position as possible so they don't see it coming when you pull the trigger.

You have a record of all the kills she was paid for?<eos> I have records of everything.<eos> All right. Even a contract killer can have a victimology, a pattern of which she's not aware.<eos> We need to find that.<eos> But first we had to get the data that we needed from the Snowman.<eos> From that we could start to build the profile that would lead us to you.<eos> When we knew what we were looking for, the pattern was obvious.<eos> These 3 hits--they were all men who wanted to kill their wives.<eos> That's the oldest motivation in the book.<eos> Why are they special?
Theoretically, if the price is high enough, a hitman shouldn't have morals.<eos> I think these kills are personal to her.<eos> Personal enough to risk double-crossing her contract.<eos> Maybe something similar happened to her.<eos> And that's how we get her to come to the table.<eos> I pretend to be that kind of client.<eos> How do we know that's gonna work?<eos> We don't.<eos> It's a calculated risk based on her M.O., which is categorically different than the men.<eos> They're cold, clinical, long-distance.
Previously on "The Vampire Diaries"...<eos> Alaric's babies...<eos> they're inside of you.<eos> I know they're not mine.<eos> They're still my responsibility.
- What did you tell him?<eos> - Everything.<eos> If we move fast, maybe we're okay.<eos> - You wanna kill him?<eos> - We don't have a choice.<eos> We could try to work him.<eos> One of us has been getting American samples of pathogens.<eos> This is to meningitis what bubonic plague is to a runny nose.<eos> Our office is a target of the illegals.<eos> Now they got to somebody inside.
Yes, every time I got a makeover in a department store, I come out looking green.<eos> But nobody sells a green foundation, so I'm very confused.<eos> And then I see my Asian friends after their department store makeover, I never knew there were so many shades of green.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> Mary Kay really helped me.<eos> Now I can help anyone find makeup for their skin tone.<eos> I tell all my friends they don't have to look like Martians.<eos> We are all Americans now.<eos> In the clergy we have very strict rules about keeping secrets.<eos> People tell us very personal things, and they wouldn't do that if they couldn't trust us.
She's not stupid, Gabriel.<eos> She'll never be sure.<eos> Will she wonder?<eos> Maybe. But you'll minimize that this week while you're in Florida.<eos> You'll be with her every single moment.<eos> No phone calls.<eos> No private discussions out of her hearing.<eos> Be in bed asleep before she is.<eos> Have fun.<eos> People believe what they need to believe.
I do.<eos> But, Philip, you don't even want that.<eos> I know you don't.<eos> Hmm. Maybe they could send us down South.<eos> You always dreamed of Odessa.<eos> - By the water.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And then what?<eos> With two kids who don't know anyone, don't know the language.<eos> You don't think they'd hate us then?
I assume it has something to do with my mission to release an army of ghosts upon the world, and plunge it into eternal darkness?<eos> Wrong.<eos> It has to do with your failure to release an army of ghosts upon the world and plunge it into eternal darkness.<eos> Well, sir, the problem is there are these two teenagers.<eos> Well, they're not exactly teenagers, they're ghosts, actually and...<eos> Nicky and Tara Roland?<eos> Yes, sir, that's them.<eos> And the thing is...<eos> You're telling me that two completely inexperienced ghosts are the only thing standing in your way?<eos> Well, they also have this friend.
If there are any ghosts in this house any souls with unfinished business any specters who wish to reach out from beyond and speak to us, please, give us a sign, any kind of sign.<eos> It doesn't have to be anything big, just... Just let us know you're here.<eos> Maybe you should leave avoicemail.<eos> Guys? Look.<eos> Max, that's incredible!<eos> Okay, spirits, that's enough.<eos> Thank you, spirits!<eos> Wait a minute, if there really are such a thing as ghosts, why would they waste their time floating candles around the room?<eos> Why don't they just show themselves?<eos> Well, maybe they're just shy?
I don't need a ticket from you.<eos> "L don't need a ticket from you."<eos> You're in the first row, Mr. Drake.<eos> "You're in the first row, Mr. Drake."<eos> Enjoy the show.<eos> "Enjoy the show."<eos> What are you doing back here?<eos> I got to talk to cammie.<eos> No, what you need to do is leave my dancers alone.<eos> I will not have you distracting them as they're about to go on in front of a live audience.
I don't know.<eos> I guess they're gone.<eos> This time forever.<eos> I do believe in ghosts.<eos> I do believe in ghosts.<eos> I do.<eos> I do believe in ghosts.<eos> I do.<eos> I do believe in ghosts.<eos> I think they could be real.
You're my friends.<eos> My best friends.<eos> Told you.<eos> Wait, I almost forgot, i met your parents!<eos> What!<eos> What!<eos> Yeah. I was in the elsewhere.<eos> Phears sent me there.<eos> What did they say?<eos> How did they look?
Won't make the voices go away, but it might keep you alive.<eos> All I can say is it was some kind of dungeon.<eos> This was in the walls.<eos> Penny, I think you were in Fillory.<eos> You were in Fillory.<eos> - You were in Fillory--<eos> - Stop!<eos> - Okay? Fillory is just a--<eos> - Did you see any animals?<eos> - Did they talk to you?
Even Eliot said it was impossible.<eos> Wait, it's impossible.<eos> Actually he said, it was practically impossible.<eos> But maybe some genius can do this.<eos> So what?<eos> Geniuses can be magicians?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Really?<eos> We have to cheat.<eos> They want us to.
The one thing I can't figure out is how to get the hook in.<eos> You know, we need someone inside for that.<eos> And I sort of burned all my bridges with that.<eos> You think we can pay someone off?<eos> No.<eos> I know someone.<eos> Took you long enough.<eos> Okay, here is the question.<eos> Do you believe what you said earlier, that a genius could solve this by dawn?<eos> Well yeah, I mean, if they were--
So, what now?<eos> If Clary doesn't make it out of there soon, you're gonna be meditating six feet under.<eos> Shadowhunter, have you ever seen a Seelie knight fight?<eos> I wouldn't be so cocky about your prowess if I were you.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Opening the doorway to this dimension may not have been a good idea.<eos> On a scale from one to namaste, how screwed are we?<eos> Demons are attracted to this dimension.<eos> It's defenseless and peaceful.<eos> They like chaos and havoc.
He's not more powerful than I am.<eos> Well, some would disagree.<eos> He is older than you.<eos> - Certainly not wiser.<eos> - Who is Ragnor Fell?<eos> The former High Warlock of London.<eos> And one of my oldest friends.<eos> Very prickly, likes to keep to himself.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> We just need to figure out which one of these warlocks had enough access to Jocelyn that they could create the potion for her without anyone discovering what they'd done.
Only a true artist would notice the subtle changes in my eyes.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> I need to work on not moving my eyes, you don't need to remind me.<eos> You knew my mom?<eos> So you made the potion that put her to sleep?<eos> At her request, yes.<eos> And I knew it was only a matter of time before you came to me looking for the antidote.<eos> Please, sit.<eos> My friends, Jace Wayland and Magnus Bane.<eos> They were with me, but I lost them in the fire.

Finally ready to kill your own father?<eos> You abandoned me.<eos> I was protecting you.<eos> You weren't ready then, but you've grown.<eos> You've become the warrior I've trained you to be.<eos> You trained me well.<eos> And yet, I still have so much to teach you.<eos> I brought you here for a reason.<eos> Look, fight me, and watch your friends die.<eos> See, you are strong, but they make you weak.
Now...<eos> Who can tell me the steps of a partial laryngectomy?<eos> In group settings, men are 75% more likely to speak up than women, and when a woman does speak up, it's statistically probable her male counterparts will either interrupt her or speak over her.<eos> It's not because they're rude.
See you later.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Do you want anything?<eos> You know... like a sandwich or a...<eos> Or a blanket?<eos> All right, all right.<eos> I'm good. I'm good. Sit down, sit down.<eos> I just spent six weeks in a bed, unable to speak.<eos> When that happens, you see things.<eos> There's a lot of things that people don't say to each other that they should just say, so I need you to hear me when I say this.
Okay, okay.<eos> Uh, glass half-full.<eos> There's someone who can save Agent Keen?<eos> Karakurt.<eos> Cooper's hiding him at a cabin near Lake Yvonne.<eos> He's not answering.<eos> I gotta get him to move Karakurt before the Director's goons get there.<eos> Go.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> You know better than anyone, they can't break in there.

I'll have 15 minutes with him.<eos> What's our next move?<eos> Rendezvous will be fruitless unless we can retrieve a certain care package.<eos> The FBI took it into custody this morning.<eos> That package is the ticket to Elizabeth's freedom.<eos> What's in the package?<eos> El Dorado.<eos> The lost city of gold?<eos> It was never a city.<eos> When Spanish explorers reached South America, they heard stories about a gold-dusted tribal chief dumping vast piles of treasure into Lake Guatavita as an offering.

[ Grunts ]<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I understand.<eos> [ Telephone ringing in distance ]<eos> I stand corrected.<eos> I have never seen two people so disappointed that the country isn't under attack.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm not convinced.<eos> So let's get Agent Keen transferred, shall we?<eos> My men are on site.<eos> And they will stay on site.
N-no, I'll - - I'll -- I'll take --<eos> Yeah, I-I-I'll handle this myself.<eos> Why don't you guys go in and interview some people?<eos> Thanks for the call.<eos> I came as soon as I --<eos> What?<eos> Yeah. I, uh, I was gonna tell you about that earlier, And I thought it would be better if I told you in person, so...<eos> So...?<eos> So, uh, the boys --<eos> They got suspicious and accused me of cheating.

You're late.<eos> I'm what? Who are you?<eos> You always ask the same questions.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You never do.<eos> I'm a member of The Order, the keepers of the libraries of the Neitherlands, the greatest repository of knowledge, full stop.<eos> Any idea who the motherfuckers in the hoods are that are trying to kill me?<eos> The locals used to work for us in a custodial function, but labor relations have become somewhat... strained of late.<eos> We had to ban them from the libraries.<eos> They've been thoroughly cursed, so they can't use the fountains, but that hasn't stopped them from finding other employment, some with a particularly nasty entity.
So what's the deal with this traveler?<eos> Why can't we just ask?<eos> I mean...<eos> My mom knows this traveler from another world, Joe.<eos> - Yeah. Apparently his actual name is impossible to pronounce.<eos> Anyway, it's kind of a touchy subject, and I think that it's best that when I talk to my mom, my dad's not around.<eos> Why? Is she sleeping with Joe?<eos> And your dad doesn't know?<eos> Alice, they were having a sex party when we showed up.<eos> Look, I know it sounds ridiculous, but my parents are weird and possessive, and they just have to do everything together.
We have four spells left.<eos> Let's just finish, okay?<eos> Then they have to let us in on their project.<eos> Just a little further.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I... I know these people.<eos> Well, every book is here... all the books ever written, all the books never written, all the books of all the people who ever lived.<eos> This is my book.<eos> Yo. Why are there all these flowers and shit on the cover?<eos> People who read their books often discover they don't like the main character and are rarely happy with how it ends.
And he was eight months old.<eos> My life was destroyed.<eos> Jesus. You're doing time magic to change what you did.<eos> Yeah, but only a fluke natural-born time witch could do something like that.<eos> Now, I have done all the research there is, and one day, I realized I was looking at it wrong.<eos> We don't have the energy, but it's not that we need to generate it, because somebody already has it.<eos> We just need them, and they can give us inexhaustible, unimaginable power.<eos> That's no one.<eos> That's the Source.<eos> That's the place it all comes from, how people used to get shit done when they needed a fucking miracle.
I'll be more fox-like if that's what you want.<eos> I don't want that.<eos> I don't get it, Alice.<eos> I'm not amazing at magic, and apparently, I'm pretty patchy at this.<eos> Why are you even with me?<eos> Because I like you.<eos> A lot.<eos> And I don't know why.<eos> I just really, really do in the weirdest way.<eos> I don't think we're supposed to like people for what they're good at.
- Perhaps we could wait a few...<eos> - No, no. We can't delay any longer.<eos> It's for one evening only.<eos> Tomorrow, I will settle with the bailiffs and you'll be back at home.<eos> Now, I have business to attend to.<eos> No. Weeks gone by and no word?<eos> - Is that all I deserve?<eos> - We can talk on my return.<eos> We talk NOW.<eos> I shan't think twice about following you there, telling your business associates the truth about who they're dealing with.
You get a feeling for your beasts,<eos> Mr Venus?<eos> I do, Inspector.<eos> The bird's flight, the hare's dash, the leap of the salmon before the trap, the poison, the gun, the gaff.<eos> I get a feeling for their freedom afore it's robbed.<eos> And breathe.<eos> Animals don't lie, I suppose.<eos> Oh, they do.<eos> Consider the jaguar - how it crouches in the tree, like a blameless shadow among the branches, but he is death and he is remorseless.<eos> Or they lie to avoid detection, pretend they are powerful when they are weak as an un-shelled chick.
I would remind you, she is still my sister.<eos> Well, if your conscience pricks, say the word and I'll tell her the truth.<eos> You could say farewell to sister and fortune with but a single wave.<eos> Why are they called lawyers?<eos> How can they contend to represent the law, or... justice, or even common decency?<eos> Jackals would be a better name!<eos> I take it Mr Jaggers offered no help?<eos> He spoke at length and eloquently, without saying very much.<eos> His main concern seemed to be the chances of getting paid by a man in debtors' prison.<eos> I have written to Father's agents overseas, but even if they can offer help, it will be months away.
That's what we're gonna find out.<eos> Monty, check the victims' background, see if there's any connection between them.<eos> You got it.<eos> Since these were all seemingly suicides, the Japanese consider them open-and-closed cases.<eos> But if this is foul play, whoever's doing it is showing no signs of slowing down.<eos> A Japanese proverb tells us<eos> "the nail that sticks out gets hammered down."<eos> Our contacts at the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department are on their way here to greet us.<eos> Oh, that's nice of them.<eos> Well, they're offended we're here.
Because of bureaucratic delays in transporting the bodies back to the U.S., all three victims are still here.<eos> Oh, well, seems to be my lucky day.<eos> How is this lucky?<eos> It's just a saying.<eos> See, I'm lucky because all three of the bodies are...<eos> I'm just gonna get to work.<eos> All right, antemortem contusions around the neck, along with the hyoid bone being snapped, all point towards asphyxia.<eos> You see something?<eos> Yep.<eos> Do you see how, at the time of death, these bruises weren't there, now they are?

Senator?<eos> He, uh, holds office in one of two legislative bodies that make the laws for this country.<eos> I know what a senator is.<eos> Have a nice day, ma'am.<eos> (trilling, chirping)<eos> (lock clicks)<eos> (door closes)<eos> ♪<eos> Sir?<eos> They're ready for you.
Do you know what I did after my first?<eos> I rang my year four teacher.<eos> Cried like I was one of the Sabine women.<eos> Why her, I don't know.<eos> Practically confessed.<eos> I'm lucky she didn't turn me in.<eos> How do you live with it...?<eos> All things pass, Brian.<eos> The volume of your feelings right now?<eos> They'll go down.
Since we couldn't put Piper's DNA into a dead body,<eos> I suggested we do it the other way around... Turn the body into Piper, at least in the system.<eos> (train horn blares) I also knew Sands would be watching the whole time, so we'd have to make it look perfect.<eos> (train horn blares)<eos> You should come away with me.<eos> I have a lab set up.<eos> I'm gonna figure out how that enzyme works, Brian.<eos> You can be free of Morra for good.<eos> The people I love aren't gone yet.<eos> They're here.
The ring finger's gone.<eos> That's the trademark of the Marrying Man.<eos> We've got a serial hugger on our hands.<eos> JOSH-O-SAURUS: "The Marrying Man"?<eos> Really?<eos> Why do bad guys get cool nicknames?<eos> Shouldn't they get stupid nicknames?<eos> I don't know, it's just what they call him.<eos> Well, you should give him a nickname he hates.<eos> You should give all the bad guys nicknames they hate.
Even though he's innocent.<eos> What do you know about optogenetics?<eos> Was that rhetorical?<eos> It's the manipulation of memory.<eos> Scientists can use blue light and a fiber-optic wire to make certain memory-oriented neurons sensitive.<eos> It is going to change the world!<eos> This is like real-life Inception.<eos> No, we're only concerned with the here and now, please.<eos> Right now neurons can be genetically modified to be more sensitive to light.<eos> They respond to blue light from a fiber-optic wire inserted into the brain just like that.
- No!<eos> Well, neither is operating.<eos> Why are you getting out your records?<eos> (grunts loudly) Just... forget it, okay?<eos> The important thing for you to know is I don't... the racquetball with him.<eos> He's..<eos> (groans) an undercover agent.<eos> Can't you get FBI doctors?<eos> No, no, I can't, because he's in too deep.<eos> They can't know he's part of the Bureau.
- then he was familiar with his target.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> So, assuming he wants to keep Henry alive, then he'll need insulin.<eos> So let's get in touch with local pharmacies and get a list of customers who bought over-the-counter insulin in the last 72 hours.<eos> You know how many diabetics there are in the five boroughs?<eos> - I got four in my family alone.<eos> - It's a start.<eos> And when we get more information we can cross-reference...<eos> Henry's parents.<eos> They just got a list of demands from the kidnapper.
(hands shake)<eos> Good.<eos> - Sir...<eos> - (Grunts)<eos> __<eos> BRIAN:<eos> So, wait, this is Huston?<eos> (monitor beeping steadily)<eos> Not that we're here to kill anyone.<eos> But usually, when you're going down a list of bad guys, they're supposed to get tougher.
Come on, come on, come on.<eos> BRIAN:<eos> TheScrubJay is dead, but at least we got his real name, because that led to his records, and that led to the recovery of some pretty strange items he fenced on the black market.<eos> (siren wailing)<eos> (moos)<eos> The good news is the ScrubJay's records also told us who bought the mind-files from Eloise.<eos> A shady think tank with ties to the highest levels of government.<eos> GERD.<eos> Global Enterprise for Research and Development.<eos> They were around before the acronym for the heartburn condition.

The list was on it.<eos> Every undercover operation we've got going has been compromised, and we're pulling all the agents as we speak.<eos> Has the list been leaked?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> We only assume it's a matter of time.<eos> NAZ:<eos> This is Adrian Vescovi.<eos> He supervises undercover work in the city, and, uh, he will fill you in on the rest.<eos> At this point, we have no idea what these thieves want.<eos> They could be selling these names, they could post them publicly at any moment.
But doesn't that mean that they'll just get rolled up in the larger investigation of Cyrillus?<eos> The second we file a case against Cyrillus Holdings, that case will encompass<eos> The Blue Limit, and every other shady business they've ever worked with.<eos> At which point, the women working there will become major liabilities.<eos> You think The Blue Limit would be inclined to get rid of them?<eos> Women who make trouble there have a way of disappearing, so, yeah, I do think that could happen on a larger scale.<eos> I want to get these women out of there.<eos> I want to find out where their passports are stashed, get them back, so they can be on their way home before charges get filed.<eos> It's not enough these guys get to go to some golf-farm white-collar prison.<eos> They're slavers.

I'd like to propose an alternative offender.<eos> Come on up.<eos> So, uh, dark red indicates our city's highest level of energy consumption.<eos> The largest consumer being here and here.<eos> Now, even though these two areas seem geographically disparate, they are, in fact, connected by the wind.<eos> Now, the power outages are following the natural citywide gust flow.<eos> I got a D-minus in environmental science, by the way.<eos> It was a real squeaker, but, you know, passing is passing.<eos> Brian, Brian, your parents must have been very proud.<eos> They really were.
I am so important to these people...<eos> Hmm.<eos> I... You know what?<eos> That's where it gets tricky, 'cause I-I can't... I can't really talk about that.<eos> It's called NZT.<eos> NZT.<eos> Now... How much of this are you understanding, Evgeny?<eos> None?<eos> Good.<eos> So I took two pills from my bodyguards before I left, and I'm pretty sure they told Rebecca.
There are other forms of currency.<eos> Influence, for example.<eos> Okay, all right.<eos> So...<eos> Who is the most influential person in the St. Petersburg prison system?<eos> Okay, so State tells us that someone in Moscow broke the bank at a casino betting on the roulette wheel.<eos> A CIA asset says someone stole a shipment of hand grenades from an arms dealer in Georgia.<eos> They're outliers.<eos> They could have been enabled by NZT, but does that sound like Brian?<eos> Well, those guys at State, they don't know Finch the way we do.
(coughs):<eos> Patriot Act.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You will have a 10:00 p.m. curfew.<eos> - What?<eos> - Which will be enforced by new escorts.<eos> Dedicated agents will accompany you from home to office.<eos> - What about when I'm off-duty?<eos> - 24/7.<eos> And they've been warned about your tendency to wander.
Oh.<eos> Roper was crazy rich.<eos> A guy like this could definitely afford a new kidney.<eos> You say the housekeeper found him?<eos> Wasn't he married?<eos> - Where's the wife?<eos> - Downstairs.<eos> She just drove in from their house in Connecticut.<eos> Gordon didn't want people to know he was sick.<eos> He knew they'd speculate about his work, what it meant for the companies he'd invested in.
And anyone they might have told anyway.<eos> Spouses, assistants, friends.<eos> Maybe one of them has a motive for killing Gordon Roper.<eos> That's weird.<eos> Where's your posse?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Mike and Ike.<eos> Well, I saw you guys huddled up yesterday.<eos> Looked a little intense.<eos> How are they taking it?

Open your Bible.<eos> Which Scripture would you have me...?<eos> Just open it.<eos> Now you don't owe me anything.<eos> But if you revere the truth, the way you claim to, you'll do this for me.<eos> None of you are safe!<eos> Your secrets!<eos> And your lies!<eos> He sees them.<eos> And He exposes them, and they lie there... grunting in the sun, stinking to high heaven.
A baker's half-hundred.<eos> Good Lord!<eos> And what do these hitchhikers' thumbs signify?<eos> Those are "likes."<eos> "Likes"?<eos> I'll show this Mrs. Homer Simpson not to make light of everything I hold dear.<eos> Call in my goons.<eos> Uh, the goons are all in Phoenix at that mindfulness seminar.<eos> Then call in my Irish ruffians.<eos> Well, they're still laid up after eating that moldy soda bread.
Wait, I think I hear something.<eos> : I'm going to make you bloody rich.<eos> No.<eos> He did talk.<eos> What if Conrad is somehow sentient?<eos> Come on, Conrad.<eos> Say something.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Coders work too hard, don't get enough sleep.<eos> Then they imagine their programs are alive.
Daddy's little Einstein?<eos> Daddy's little Einstein.<eos> Anyway, bling your shit up, blood.<eos> Hey, and if it don't work out, I got bitches.<eos> Cool.<eos> Bool.<eos> I completely forgot about the surveys these kids did.<eos> Yeah, well, they were still in sealed envelopes. Voice of the children. You believe this?<eos> It's so telling.<eos> And you were right, they did mostly list basketball and football in their interests.

Why are you putting spoons in the laundry hamper?<eos> I'm hiding our nice stuff.<eos> See, my cousin Bobby and Carol are coming in town, and they're gonna ask me for money, so I'm...
Boundaries.<eos> You know, you and me.<eos> Boundaries.<eos> All right, let's do this.<eos> - We're having a baby! - Yes.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh, my God, my boobs are<eos> - gonna get huge!<eos> - Unbelievable!<eos> They're gonna be like, "Get out of my way.
I never said...<eos> I found your list.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Oh, my god. Dev, I...<eos> I was reading this magazine, and it said that I...<eos> You know what?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It was juvenile.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> People make these kinds of lists when they're weighing their options, so I need you to be honest with me.
You could do anything for six days and nights, couldn't you?<eos> For the next six days, you play a level of intensity you've never played before.<eos> You push yourself.<eos> You use your voice, your body to keep finding a way to increase that energy.<eos> Because at that energy level, you'll get totally different insights than at the one most people live in day-to-day.<eos> And they go, "I get it.<eos> I understand.<eos> I do." But if you and I wake up, we could take back control forever.<eos> You're gonna watch people stand up in the next few days and they're gonna reclaim their life.<eos> They're gonna wake up.
Give these two a giant hand.<eos> How do you select people?<eos> I mean, like, when you're walking through the crowd, do you vibe it out?<eos> It's instinctive. I don't really know.<eos> I mean, sometimes I know.<eos> Sometimes, I'm looking for something specifically, but today, it's just instinctive things we're going for.<eos> And then, you know, I feel, "Where can I take this? Where can it go?"<eos> And the whole thing is... It's a dance.<eos> You know, to go from thinking her problem is dietary, which is where people are.<eos> They present this low-level stuff because we engage ourself with little problems that we make into big things so we don't deal with the bigger ones that scare us, and so it was a beautiful example of that.
He taught you you're his little princess, didn't he?<eos> Motherfucker.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Tony, sometimes you use rather extreme language with people.<eos> It's kind of shocking.<eos> I use language in a very direct way.<eos> In every culture, there are taboo words.<eos> And when you use them, you're able to interrupt the noise in people's heads.<eos> I want to provoke people back into the reality of this moment.<eos> That's how they change.
Mother was murdered by stepfather.<eos> One of the children was forced by an adult to abuse his sister.<eos> They were held hostage for three days in a terrorist attack.<eos> Um, at age six, she had sexual abuse from a close family member.<eos> Age 11, physical abuse from her father.<eos> And at age 17, her closest brother was killed in a motorcycle accident.<eos> One thing that can sometimes happen when we go through the special care review is people can focus on these... these negative events that have happened in people's lives.<eos> What I would suggest we might focus on is the impact that we're going to be able to make.<eos> The events are really irrelevant.<eos> I mean, they're important. They're what's happened to people.
Okay, one really fucked up, two really fucked up...<eos> So many fucked up choices.<eos> No, now I know who I'm not gonna call on.<eos> All the people that want attention. No, you're all fucking dead.<eos> Now I know who you are, none of you.<eos> I'd really like to, sincerely, bring somebody up who is suicidal.<eos> And I know you're out there simply because in a room of 2,500 people, on average, there's 12 people that are suicidal.<eos> So now would be the chance for you to handle this shit, so you don't have to live with that anymore.<eos> So, if you're suicidal, stand up.<eos> Okay, give these people a hand, they're suicidal, for God sakes.
That's the fucking roar!<eos> Fuck yes, brother!<eos> That's the fucking roar.<eos> Give me a roar!<eos> Give me a roar.<eos> Give me a fucking roar!<eos> That's it.<eos> That's the fuckin' roar.<eos> Why do you dedicate an entire day of the seminar to relationships?<eos> Because if you don't, then people will go and they've wired themself for joy and happiness and then part of their joy and happiness is... Not all the rules are just tied to them, they're in a relationship.
What are you gonna become?<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> What are you gonna feel?"<eos> Now is the time for us all to step up.<eos> This next stage is a day you'll remember as long as you live.<eos> It'll be a new birthday for some of you.<eos> A birth you created.<eos> A birth of new values, a new life, and a new direction.<eos> So let's step up and make it happen now.<eos> It may be my own bias, but I really don't believe people really feel fulfilled staying where they are.
"Mr. Robbins, you'll remain after class."<eos> Pulls me aside after class.<eos> And I'll never forget, I'm thinking, "Oh, my God, I am so busted."<eos> And he said, "You know why you're here?" I said, "Yes, I know why I'm here, sir."<eos> And he said, "No, you don't. I can tell you don't."<eos> He said, "I know who you are."<eos> I said, "Excuse me?"<eos> He said,<eos> "I know you want the girl's attention. That's not why you're here."<eos> It's pretty rare to be able to serve people in a state like this where they come and they are willing to put everything on the line and they're willing to open up.
Middle child syndrome, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Feel invisible sometimes.<eos> Yeah, like you could just not show up one day and no one would notice.<eos> Exactly.<eos> [chuckles]<eos> [chuckles]<eos> I get why you're pissed off I moved in.<eos> When I was a kid, my parents used to like to play partner roulette a lot.<eos> Together, apart, together, and when they'd break up, one of them would bring home a new mommy or daddy for a few weeks.
It's not the Ritz, but at least the monsters inside know how to massage.<eos> - You know Shiatsu?<eos> - Yes, I've taken some classes.<eos> So, you're really just gonna let Bill win?<eos> Look, kiddo.<eos> We got a good deal here.<eos> Besides, I'm sure wherever the rest of the townsfolk are, they're fine.<eos> This is Shandra Jimenez reporting live from the inside of Bill's castle.<eos> Here for the first time are images of what's happened to the captured townsfolk.<eos> Viewers are advised to look away if they don't want to see their friends turned into a twisted throne of human agony.
Then what's the point of making a map?<eos> To drive whoever has the map crazy.<eos> No, they did this so they could go back and find whatever they took from the sack of Constantinople.<eos> I mean, you don't just make a map and imprint it on the side of seven keys for fun.<eos> It's the Middle Ages.<eos> This type of metallurgy took a lot of work.<eos> You see, legend has it there are seven keys.<eos> - Seven?<eos> - Forged by the knights who fought for the seven royal families in the Fourth Crusade.<eos> Now, when you put the maps together, they make one big map, leading to the location where the knights hid the precious wealth they took from Constantinople after they sacked and burned it.

You don't.<eos> You're gonna need me.<eos> He's right, Nick.<eos> Can't do this alone.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, what if Black Claw knows about the keys and knew they were in the trunk?<eos> Black Claw doesn't know we have the trunk, and the guys they sent to find it are dead.<eos> But the trunk did belong to Josef Nebojsa, whose distant relative was a knighted Crusader.<eos> And a Grimm.<eos> And since it was seven Grimm knights who buried whatever it is they buried...
And I can tell you that his insight into the real issues that we face, his ability to find common-sense solutions, and his unwavering commitment to address the needs of every single community in this city is exactly what Portland needs.<eos> Ladies and gentleman, it's my pleasure to introduce to you my good friend, and Portland's next mayor, Andrew Dixon.<eos> Thank you, Sean.<eos> And thank all of you for coming out today.<eos> Did you know that between 1524 and 1526 over 100,000 German peasants were killed in these woods?<eos> I did not.<eos> Does that surprise you?<eos> No. I guess not.<eos> It was called the German Peasants' War.<eos> Peasants were being treated like crap, so they invoked divine law, demanding freedom from the oppression of their landlords and the nobles.

But I am curious just how many cars are on this crazy train, so... why don't you tell me a little bit about how you see the world.<eos> Worlds.<eos> There's nine worlds.<eos> Ask me anything you like.<eos> So, why do I need a guardian angel?<eos> There are so many people that need a guardian angel more than I do.<eos> Well, and they all have them.<eos> You see, guardian angels are like herpes.<eos> Everyone has a version of it that they don't know about.<eos> And no matter how hard they try, they can't get rid of us.
He's great.<eos> He's acing his classes.<eos> He was, uh, banging this professor, and that got kind of ugly, but... you know Lip.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Take a shower.<eos> I'll wash the dress.<eos> Sorry, I was with the accountant.<eos> Where you headed?<eos> Law offices of Klifton and Klifton, explain why I don't have this fucking ring.<eos> Gus has two lawyers and they're both named Klifton?
Help.<eos> Hey, hey. Wake up. Wake up.<eos> Come on.<eos> Got him?<eos> I got nothing.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> Burying something under these stones?<eos> I mean, that's kind of overkill, don't you think?<eos> I mean, we are in the catacombs of an ancient church in the middle of the Black Forest.<eos> You really think the crusaders would have made it that difficult if they ever wanted to come back for this thing someday?

You really think the crusaders would have made it that difficult if they ever wanted to come back for this thing someday?<eos> Well, we have to check, because they might have, and we're not coming back.<eos> But think about it...<eos> Archeology, anthropology as we know it didn't exist back then.<eos> History wasn't something you studied.<eos> It was something you made, usually with a lot of blood.<eos> I'm just saying, I think...<eos> I think we need to think like them.<eos> So 800 years ago, people were very superstitious.<eos> They wouldn't have liked being down here.
I can't tell what you're looking at.<eos> Oh, my God, that better be your hand.<eos> Look at those skulls.<eos> Seven of 'em.<eos> Kind of a circle.<eos> Don't look like a circle. Looks more like a G.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> For the seven Grimm crusaders.<eos> Holy crap.<eos> They're all facing in, not out.
It was definitely Wesen.<eos> No, this doesn't make any sense.<eos> Why would he kill a candidate running for mayor of Portland?<eos> He's Black Claw.<eos> His targets are bigger than this.<eos> Unless Dixon was Wesen.<eos> Was he?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> Feds are here.<eos> They're gonna be all over this.
I don't know.<eos> It's nothing that need concern you.<eos> I'm a reporter. That category does not exist.<eos> What are they?<eos> You wouldn't believe me if I told you.<eos> No reason not to tell me, then.<eos> Those brains, they aren't just brains.<eos> They're independent alien life forms.<eos> And...?<eos> They migrate from planet to planet, extracting and replacing the central nervous systems of compatible hosts.
They'll find the safest place to hide themselves away and send all their young people to die.<eos> And where's the safest place in every capital city now?<eos> What's the only part of New York still standing?<eos> Harmony Shoal.<eos> New York isn't a capital city.<eos> It's a shop window.<eos> "When the world is in danger, come hide with us."<eos> Harmony Shoal will open its doors<eos> - to the terrified leaders of the world.<eos> - And they will come running.
- to the terrified leaders of the world.<eos> - And they will come running.<eos> A few hours later, every politician and commander-in-chief will have a zip in their head.<eos> An alien sitting inside their skull.<eos> In one day of terror, the executive authority of Planet Earth will pass to Harmony Shoal.<eos> It's a good plan, I like it.<eos> How come our side never gets plans like that?<eos> The humans have no plan at all.<eos> That's where you're wrong.<eos> They have the same plan they always have.
I think we should be helping her to feel more hopeful.<eos> As her doctor, that's not my job.<eos> Well, as her friend, it is mine.<eos> And she's giving up.<eos> She's feeling trapped.<eos> I'm worried about her state of mind.<eos> Alex, you should probably take a look at this.<eos> What am I looking at?<eos> Dana's latest P.E.T. scan results.<eos> They just came in.
I don't know.<eos> Then I can't trust you.<eos> That's the truth.<eos> It's not good enough.<eos> Talia, listen to me.<eos> If agents from your government come and demand that you go with them, don't do it.<eos> Run.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> What good would that do?<eos> They always catch you.
Lead as wisely as we can, and then... carry the weight of it as best we can.<eos> I-I wonder if that's how General Doroshevich feels about his medals.<eos> I think it's worth trying to find out.<eos> Mr. President, General.<eos> As we speak, your heroic cosmonauts are engaging in a record number of space walks to provide their American comrades with the space suits they need to save their lives.<eos> Their heroism is an inspiration to the entire world.<eos> Can we not follow their example and put aside our differences for the greater good?<eos> We want to urge you to reconsider our offer, Mr. President, and preserve the peace that so many have lost their lives trying to secure, including President Ostrova...<eos> Your words are most inspirational.<eos> Regrettably they will not bring back our murdered president.

Snow... you can't let the fear of failing stop you from trying.<eos> This medal... it was for the first Labor I ever completed...<eos> Defeating the Nemean Lion.<eos> I was scared.<eos> But I didn't back down.<eos> I fought the lion, and I won.<eos> And I wouldn't have this medal if I'd been too afraid to try.<eos> Easy for you to say.<eos> Snow...<eos> I'm going to teach you how to stand up to those bandits so they never show their faces in your kingdom again.
Oh, this?<eos> Oh, this?<eos> No.<eos> This isn't for you.<eos> It's for your friends.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What in the bloody hell am I supposed to do with this?<eos> Simple accounting, really.<eos> At first, I wanted your friends to leave.<eos> I really had such a smooth-running operation going here before they arrived, but now I've decided they've caused too much damage, so my vindictive side...
Man:<eos> I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> She's in here.<eos> Cut looks clean, surgical.<eos> As if Amy's head was taken off with a single blow.<eos> Do you need to have a medical background to do this?<eos> Not necessarily, but you'd need something razor sharp to achieve this precise a wound.<eos> The unsub would need a powerful swing, not to mention great aim. JJ:<eos> It looks like her knuckles are broken.<eos> They are.
Like Amy Gibb, the first two victims had called for ride-share cars and then canceled.<eos> To me, this whole ride-share thing's not much different than hitchhiking, except you gotta pay.<eos> I get the appeal.<eos> It's quick and easy.<eos> You just have to enter your location via smartphone.<eos> Right.<eos> And then some random car pulls up and you hop in.<eos> That sounds safe.<eos> Well, riders are sent the driver's name, photo, license plate number.<eos> They know who's picking them up.
Hello, Ivy.<eos> I'm Alia.<eos> I work for the Avon and Somerset Constabulary.<eos> I'm going to be your Family Liaison Officer.<eos> Does that sound OK?<eos> I'll take it from here.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Let's get you up.<eos> Keep it open, please.<eos> When the detectives arrive, they'll have to shut it, just for privacy.
When this part of the interview is done with,<eos> Ivy will see a female doctor for tests.<eos> What kind of tests?<eos> Could you just let the girl speak? !<eos> Sorry.<eos> Details of the force's wider support team, for you, as a family.<eos> Psychiatrists, psychotherapists.<eos> No need, thank you.<eos> Besides the shock...<eos> This shock you're in right now, they're there to help with Ivy's readjustment.
We'll find her, Ivy.<eos> We will.<eos> They kept me in overnight.<eos> Until they were satisfied that I knew nothing about that...<eos> Him... working here.<eos> Would you... dig out the contact details of all staff from the period that Mark White was on these premises?<eos> - I want to talk to them.<eos> - Aren't the police doing that?<eos> People clam up with them.<eos> They know me.
Do you?<eos> But, now you know I didn't run...<eos> You can trust me.<eos> You've been out there.<eos> All those germs... ..all those people... ..spreading their lies.<eos> I bet you feel a part of it.<eos> Of their world.<eos> Don't lie to me.<eos> I can see it.<eos> They've got in.
I'll see what I can cobble together from the fridge.<eos> Whatever hour they get home, they'll need food.<eos> What you did was idiotic.<eos> You endangered yourself, our daughter...<eos> I took charge.<eos> I thought that's what you wanted, but now...<eos> Stop, both of you!<eos> It's just like the first time.<eos> And it didn't bring her back then, did it?<eos> Eyes, or they'll sting.
You know, friends sharing with friends in a completely safe environment.<eos> Well, I've been having this recurring dream...<eos> Yeah, well, you'll have it again.<eos> Let's talk about me.<eos> Girls, Oleg and I have been having a lot of sex.<eos> You know, standing up, sitting down, on a elevator, on a escalator.<eos> Oh, yeah. Going down and up at the same time.<eos> All of that unprotected sex, and still no baby.<eos> Did you just come here to brag?<eos> You know, Sophie, sometimes when people have trouble getting pregnant, they see a doctor.
Make way!<eos> You all right, lady?<eos> Control of this story is getting away from us.<eos> The opposition's blood is up.<eos> We have to respond.<eos> Respond how?<eos> I would suggest by commissioning a public enquiry.<eos> An enquiry would be expensive.<eos> Winston, people are angry.<eos> They see us as the culprits.
No?<eos> A dihedral angle or an absolute ceiling.<eos> These are very interesting concepts.<eos> You might learn something, in exchange for a foreign office briefing?<eos> Am I going to have to explain my position again?<eos> - No.<eos> - Good.<eos> "Once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward, for there you have been and there you will always long to return."<eos> You know what's remarkable about those words?<eos> - They were written 300 years before man first got in a plane.
- Dickie.<eos> ...and insisted that you live in Buckingham Palace.<eos> - As, alas, did everyone else.<eos> - And now with looters on the street and hospital corridors stacked with the dead, he is interested in only one thing.<eos> Stopping Philip flying.<eos> - At a crisis cabinet meeting this morning when there should've only been one thing on the agenda, the unfolding national emergency... all our Prime Minister wanted to discuss was your husband's new hobby.<eos> - I'm so sorry, sir.<eos> - Who are her parents?<eos> Her father is a clergyman. From Suffolk.<eos> - They've been notified.
Okay, let's not talk about sex, because the chief is here.<eos> I'm just eating my pizza.<eos> Besides, it sounds like none of y'all are getting any anyway.<eos> Pierce is getting some.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Forget he said that.<eos> So annoying.<eos> She has people over all the time, like if I'm alone, I'll explode or something.<eos> They won't go away.
Soaked in pee.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Soaked in pee.<eos> Can I go now?<eos> I told you everything.<eos> Well, Ronnie, you can go, but, uh, you're gonna work for us now.<eos> What?<eos> You're gonna go back to your crew.<eos> They're gonna decide who they're gonna whack in retaliation for killing the boss, and you're gonna call us and let us know.<eos> My guys will cut me to pieces if they find out.

It can't.<eos> And it shouldn't.<eos> There's something else.<eos> Take a look at this.<eos> I got curious who had Joe's shield number before he did.<eos> That's every cop who had shield number 46808.<eos> And 468 and 46.<eos> Failed liver transplant... racketeering conviction... suicide-- what are you saying?<eos> I don't know.<eos> These guys were not accountants, they were cops-- they lived dangerous, stressful lives.
And all I did last night was send my guys home early.<eos> You want me to believe that for the first time in all of Mob history, a crew didn't get together and try to figure out who killed their boss-- your brother?<eos> I don't know what they did after they left, okay?<eos> I was busy taking care of John Jr.'s wife and kids.<eos> We got a funeral to plan.<eos> Is that okay with you?<eos> Look, someone put it in your crew's head that the Black Lotus Boys are the reason you're buying a coffin right now.<eos> You think we killed John Jr.?<eos> The Vinchettis clearly do.<eos> And your men sure pulled out their guns pretty fast when they busted through the door.
Disco Stu is in denial with you.<eos> Check it out, Uncle A.<eos> I made this place healthy.<eos> I added softer lighting.<eos> We're even getting a better class of robber.<eos> I'm afraid I must relieve you of your spare cash and a nice bottle of gin.<eos> Ah, Mrs. Peel, shall we?<eos> Okay, those guys are cool, but still, Jamshed-- I-I'm-I'm sorry, Jay--<eos> I know my customers.<eos> All they want is something they can eat while driving.
Nice club.<eos> Are you new?<eos> Just visiting.<eos> Not much of a golfer.<eos> Unfortunately, neither am I.<eos> Harvey Specter.<eos> Jim Paulsen.<eos> I assume this is about the opportunity<eos> Donna brought you.<eos> It'd be an opportunity if the numbers added up, Jim, but they don't.
So what?<eos> So he can give Gibbs something she doesn't even have on me yet.<eos> Yes, but to do that, he'd be ruining his whole career.<eos> Which means, even if he remembers you, he's more afraid of you than you are of him.<eos> So calm the hell down.<eos> All right, let's make this quick.<eos> Your Honor, making it quick is exactly what we're asking you to do.<eos> She hasn't handed over her discovery yet.<eos> I'm still building a case, and we haven't even set a date for the trial yet.<eos> And the check's in the mail, and all the other things people say when they don't wanna do what they have to do.
Clients aren't the ones writing editorials for "The Wall Street Journal", Jack.<eos> You want to poach an attorney.<eos> I wanna poach a whole goddamn department.<eos> That is definitely another way to go.<eos> It's the only way to go, because if we didn't do what we're saying we didn't do, this is what we do.<eos> I get it.<eos> You're trying to convince the world we're innocent.<eos> Jack, I don't give a shit if my enemies think<eos> I'm innocent or not.<eos> I give a shit whether they think they can take me down, which is why I'm not going to cower in some pro Bono corner, trying to convince them that I'm friendly.
- Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Rachel.<eos> Have you thought about what may happen when this is all over?<eos> You mean if Mike goes to jail.<eos> I mean even if he doesn't.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Even if he is acquitted, there is an excellent chance he will be thrown out of the bar and never be able to practice law again.<eos> It wouldn't matter, because Mike is prepared to never practice law again anyway.<eos> And sometimes people think they're prepared and they're not.
Donna, I--<eos> You know, I always talk like nothing can get to me.<eos> Well, it did today.<eos> I crumbled up there, and I hurt Mike's case.<eos> And I'm ashamed of myself, and I don't know what to do.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here's what you're gonna do.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You are going to sit down with me and have a glass of wine and relax.<eos> Because juries aren't stupid, and they aren't allowed to infer anything from what you said, so they won't.
You know, I've heard a lot of people talk about the great Harvey Specter, completely unbeatable.<eos> From what I'm seeing, you're just a bully who uses other people's fears to get what he wants.<eos> Well, it's not gonna happen tonight, because Mike Ross is about to go to prison and I'm not going to stop him.<eos> Harvey, it's the middle of the night.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - I had to see you. I know you said I couldn't do this anymore, but I need to talk to you.<eos> - Talk about what?<eos> - About what I have to do.<eos> You're gonna turn yourself in, aren't you?<eos> Louis, the jury didn't come back, and since they went home, I'm going home.
They're my clients.<eos> Well, I don't care, because I'm not breaking privilege and risking my entire career in exchange for five clients.<eos> What's it gonna take?<eos> You want my price?<eos> I want to go shopping at Pearson Specter Litt.<eos> Exclusive access to hire anyone I want, from paralegals to senior partners and their clients, for the next month.<eos> You'd be gutting the firm.<eos> Do I look like I care?<eos> There is no way Jessica accepts this, and you know it.<eos> What I know is, people will do anything if they're desperate enough.
Donna, can I talk to Rachel for a second?<eos> Mike, you can't.<eos> You can't see her before the ceremony.<eos> Donna, please.<eos> Okay, Donna, can you just help me put...<eos> Mike, you can't see me in my dress.<eos> Rachel, we can't do this.<eos> What?<eos> I just walked in and I saw your parents.<eos> They're here because they have to be, not because they want to be.

Before I'm allowed to even set foot in the penthouse dining room, I'll be diverted into an adjoining suite.<eos> I'll be asked to relinquish all weapons and personal items.<eos> - I will then be relieved of electronic devices and asked for a password.<eos> Red:<eos> Borsheim.<eos> My clothes will be physically and electronically inspected before I step out onto the 22nd floor.<eos> Which is why we'll be deploying the latest surveillance tech from the CIA.<eos> What about transmitter intercepts?<eos> The transmitters run on a delay.<eos> Once activated, they won't come online for four minutes.

Oh, yes.<eos> About him.<eos> [ Gunshot ]<eos> Fastest way to the roof is this express elevator.<eos> We're not going up, Dmitri.<eos> We're taking the service elevator down to the garage.<eos> Then who are the choppers for?<eos> [ Blades whirring, men shouting indistinctly ]<eos> Navabi:<eos> Why aren't they landing?
Woman:<eos> Hey!<eos> Hold up.<eos> Hold up.<eos> Something extra.<eos> Oh.<eos> Thanks.<eos> The boys had a blast.<eos> They're good kids... except yours.
Generally speaking,<eos> I'm not a huge fan of the incorruptible, but your new pontiff?<eos> He is not your father's holy father.<eos> He has an undeniable decency, which you sorely lack.<eos> Yes.<eos> At his instruction, you helped to root out corruption so that the Vatican Bank would no longer be in the money-laundering business, but to paraphrase Aristotle, corruption abhors a vacuum.<eos> So you moved right in.<eos> You and your little band of eunuchs.<eos> Kudos on that, by the way.<eos> Gathering sick men, tricking them into thinking they're killing pedophiles when, in fact, they're killing money launderers whose business you covet?
Smoking on school grounds is a public health law violation.<eos> I was attacked.<eos> We're searching for the people who assaulted you.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Yes, those nutjobs assaulted me.<eos> I'm the victim.<eos> Today you are.<eos> But the people who victimized you?<eos> Those nutjobs?<eos> They go after two types of people-- pedophiles and money launderers.
I can't believe that he's here.<eos> Ethan.<eos> Hey.<eos> It's me.<eos> It's dad.<eos> I just-<eos> - I-- I-I-I don't understand.<eos> Where did you find him?<eos> The cops won't tell us anything.<eos> They're still investigating, but, uh, we'll give you two a moment.
I searched the National Child Identification Program, and of the prints we lifted from the finger paint on Ethan's body, seven of them belong to that group of missing children.<eos> We need to find this Noah Shuster and figure out where this city of lost kids is.<eos> You lied to me!<eos> We had a deal.<eos> Two ladies for you, one address for me.<eos> Ladies, the kind that walk on two legs, preferably hairless.<eos> I want the address.<eos> You think it's funny?<eos> Little dogs?<eos> I thought they'd be a nice gesture.

I wasn't looking for a "Thank you".<eos> I'm just relieved.<eos> I found a couple... to take the baby.<eos> Thinking about it is one thing, but actually doing it...<eos> How did she do it-- my mother?<eos> Your parents loved each other very much.<eos> The Cold War was hard-- too hard for your father.<eos> When the Soviet Union was collapsing, he took you from her.<eos> She gave up everything to follow him, to follow you.<eos> The night of the fire-- that's what they were arguing about?
Your mother was never the same after that.<eos> The man she loved killed by the child she adored-- it was... just too much.<eos> Two months later, she went to Cape May and left her clothes on the beach, walked into the ocean, and was never seen again.<eos> So, that night, I killed both my parents.<eos> You were a child.<eos> There should never have been a gun for you to grab.<eos> Looking back, I'm not sure I shouldn't have raised you myself.<eos> I don't want you looking back with that kind of regret.<eos> Where are they?<eos> They're ugly, then they're beautiful.
Your assistant said you had a matter of some urgency to discuss.<eos> We have a major national security breach.<eos> Anybody with a tree to shake has been ordered to shake it, see if anything falls out.<eos> This is the Reddington tree.<eos> How can we help?<eos> Two known terrorists penetrated the port of Tampa 14 hours ago.<eos> German BND had them hard on the radar, and we lost them.<eos> The terrorists?<eos> No, the Germans.<eos> Seems someone leaked some documents implicating them in some kind of cover-up, and they think it was us.
I did it to save a woman's life.<eos> And now many more may die.<eos> I don't mean to gloat, but boy, did I tell you so.<eos> You know everything there is to know about port security.<eos> Yes, but this isn't about port security.<eos> It's about cargo theft in Florida.<eos> Luckily for you, Harold, I poke my thumb in many pies.<eos> This one is particularly profitable, so I've associated myself with some of the players.<eos> Can your associates find the truck?<eos> Their methods are breathtakingly simple-- place their own tracking devices on cargo containers, track them out of the port, and attack them when they're most vulnerable.

Every step, it was, "go down there, go to those kids, you know, make them confess."<eos> You know, next thing, I'm standing in a hospital over Eric<eos> - because he tried to kill himself.<eos> - That wasn't your fault.<eos> Well, I gave in, and that was my fault.<eos> All right? It's...<eos> I gave in as a... as a...<eos> As a coach, as a friend, and Eric almost died.<eos> So, when people, they start coming to me, telling me what to do...<eos> Well, they're not your wife.
About fidelity... And unity.<eos> I don't know what she wanted, but I never would have told them to lie.<eos> But have you ever really tried to find out the truth?<eos> The truth...<eos> Isn't cynical.<eos> I just... I want something better for you...<eos> And better for our daughter.<eos> Becca has us.<eos> Those... those boys...<eos> They need me.

You know, and you...<eos> T-they need somebody like you, too, at that school.<eos> Yeah, documenting the sins.<eos> I'm not leaving them.<eos> Then we better get ready to go to this thing tonight.<eos> Leslie really wants you to go to this thing.<eos> We have to go. You know that, right?<eos> So the haters can hate?<eos> Haters gonna hate regardless, honey.<eos> That's all they have for themselves.
Heads high...<eos> Looking fine and undefeated.<eos> That's how we start to get our son's name back.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, there are any number of pleasures that come with being on the board of directors of Leyland, but none greater than presenting the head, heart, and soul of our school, Dr. Leslie Graham.<eos> To all our friends, families, and donors who helped make tonight's performance possible, thank you.<eos> We have a long history of academic excellence here at Leyland.<eos> In recent days, although this entire community has been challenged, I am happy to say our future has never been more assured.<eos> We are so proud of all of our students, who showed everyone what we at Leyland already know...<eos> Real men stand up for each other.<eos> Real men stand up for what they believe in.
I wish I had hit myself harder.<eos> Don't say that, honey.<eos> Move a bit.<eos> Good morning, Mr. Etesami.<eos> How are you?<eos> Mr. Yeganeh said to give you back these books.<eos> Silence.<eos> What's so funny?<eos> Why?<eos> He says they're inappropriate for the students.
He buzzed, I opened.<eos> He must've thought it was her.<eos> And when he realized his mistake, why did he stay?<eos> Because there was a woman in the shower.<eos> - How would he know?<eos> - Your clothes on the bed.<eos> If I'd answered the damn intercom and asked who it was, he wouldn't have come up.<eos> Okay, so go to the neighbors and explain you should've answered.<eos> - What business is it of theirs?<eos> - They know.
He was protecting her. All Mateo was doing was acting like a thug!<eos> I don't wanna go to Leyland anymore.<eos> The police called.<eos> They're not gonna arrest anybody.<eos> There are not gonna be any charges. I need to know from you that this is over, that you're done putting us through this.<eos> Are you gay?<eos> Mom said that's why you tried to kill yourself.<eos> Eric Tanner's return has to be a display of tolerance.<eos> We don't have to change what people believe.<eos> What we have to change is how they perceive the issue.
I want to keep that on the schedule.<eos> - The assembly? - The assembly for Eric Tanner.<eos> Yes. And I also need a writer... a really good one.<eos> - If he's openly gay, that would be best.<eos> - Okay. E-mail the queries on my behalf.<eos> Make sure you lead with Leyland's commitment to inclusiveness.<eos> The people from the seminar called again.<eos> - Which? - They want you speak at that, uh, crisis management in the age of social media.<eos> As this school is facing a lawsuit.<eos> Well, they want to recognize you for it.
So discussing a settlement...<eos> Mm. I sat across from that woman.<eos> She's not gonna take the money.<eos> Put a check in front of people, their opinions aren't always as resolute.<eos> She wants us to bleed in public.<eos> It's a settlement or it's court.<eos> That's pretty much it.<eos> This can be handled.<eos> It just... it can.<eos> And these people think they can't be touched.

How does it feel?<eos> How does it feel to be back?<eos> Uh... it feels okay.<eos> - Yeah. Well, we're happy that you're back, that you're healthy.<eos> The things that you've been through...<eos> Well, what that family put you through...<eos> Nobody should have to deal with that.<eos> Nobody. But...<eos> But we're dealing with ignorance, and the only way to deal with ignorance is through education.<eos> - People... they just... they...

Same man who spent eight months raising me, screaming about queers.<eos> Do you remember that game, Nate?<eos> I remember that game.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> I'm talking with someone, and he tells me I've got to... confront things.<eos> So... I'm confronting things.<eos> - It isn't working how it is.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> Us being apart now... the boys ask for you.<eos> They do.
Well, to be falsely accused of assault, to be an openly gay athlete, to be a role model...<eos> What's that mean to you?<eos> I'm trying not to think about all that.<eos> But that's what everybody else is doing.<eos> All of a sudden, everybody's making a big deal of it.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Do you think you've made it easier for other gay athletes to come out?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Probably not.<eos> They see all this attention I'm getting, they might want to hide out more since all anyone wants to talk about is how I'm gay.
How is any of this right?<eos> Look, I want to... yes...<eos> You're absolu...<eos> You did the right thing, holding the meeting.<eos> What you don't want to do is you don't want to look like you're running and hiding.<eos> You've just got to confront these...<eos> I'm not looking for confrontation.<eos> You've got to engage folks directly, and you did.<eos> I actually think some good is gonna come out of this.<eos> People don't deal with issues until they're in front of them, and now it's in front of them.
And he said, "I'm just gonna do my time and be done with my senior year and graduate and go on to college where people are more accepting."<eos> And I said, "I think that's a great idea, A.J."<eos> And those were the last words my son said to me before he took his life.<eos> At the age of 17, I was already independent because of the impacts of bullying on me at like 8 and 9.<eos> And my parents all this time's wondering, like,<eos> "What's happening in school? What's happening in school?"<eos> These kids are really this vicious.<eos> You hear these stories on the news.<eos> These kids really are this vicious.<eos> And I thought, "Okay, if they're gonna be vicious, then I'm gonna be vicious back."
That reality gets put in front of you, and you find something.<eos> It's a formality.<eos> That's all.<eos> Don't bull... me.<eos> The school board is getting jawed to death on the student protests.<eos> They're politicians.<eos> They have to look like they're doing something.<eos> They'll sit you down and give you a review.<eos> You know it's not gonna end there.<eos> Three boys beat one boy, and they beat him because he's black.

Hello?<eos> Ms. Blaine, this is Sebastian.<eos> I'm in Indiana.<eos> I would really like for us to talk.<eos> See, it started with pictures getting posted online.<eos> Then it was texts and e-mails he sent, then somebody putting your medical records up.<eos> That wasn't for nothing.<eos> Whoever put your records up, they were trying to attack you.<eos> You see, the social space, it's... it's not physical.<eos> So people think they can do whatever they want, but that's not how it is.
You think I care?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> LeSean was a dumbass.<eos> Oh, I don't give a... about him.<eos> There's nothing here.<eos> This team is a joke.<eos> The... team is a joke.<eos> This whole joint is just... It's...<eos> It's like a show that rich people put on.<eos> They can act how they want and say what they want, but it's not real.
Leslie, we've got a problem.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's serious.<eos> The school servers have been hacked.<eos> - They've been...<eos> - Documents have been posted online.<eos> - What kind of documents?<eos> - E-mails, internal memos relating to the whole Taylor Blaine incident.<eos> - Where?<eos> - They're on a TOR server, and it's already flying around social media.
I need something else.<eos> I-I need more things.<eos> I need... I need something else.<eos> Okay. I-It has to be more.<eos> You understand?<eos> There's gonna be more.<eos> That...<eos> That's just how it starts.<eos> The boys are spinning out.<eos> They're lost and bitter, and I can't help them.

But I'm a white hat... hacking for justice.<eos> What's your relationship to Taylor Blaine?<eos> I got no relationship.<eos> I followed the case in the media, and I could see that this kid and his single mom were getting railroaded.<eos> That school needed to be called on it and held accountable.<eos> Know what I'm saying?<eos> You see, that first round, that was just a warning.<eos> Now things are gonna get serious.<eos> Serious how?<eos> Further devastation for The Leyland School... exposing individuals for who they are and what they did.
- Really? But you're a girl.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. Girls can like trucks.<eos> Well, I don't know any girls who like trucks.<eos> My brothers don't even like trucks.<eos> - What are they doing?<eos> - Killing ants.<eos> - Do girls do that?<eos> - They can.<eos> I don't.<eos> Well, before, they were putting Tiger Balm on their wieners.
Mr. Piscatella... this is really getting embarrassing.<eos> I am a respected woman in this camp.<eos> Oh, I realize that.<eos> But the respect you earned... didn't come from making latkes, did it, Red?<eos> What on earth are you on about now?<eos> You know... I've been in corrections a long time.<eos> I've had inmates spit in my face... throw piss and shit at me.<eos> I've had people punch me, kick me. I was even stabbed once.<eos> But I don't hold it against 'em.<eos> In fact, I respect those type of criminals because they are honest.

She loved Mayfair.<eos> And she loved you.<eos> She's got a very funny way of showing it.<eos> You know, when... when I was a little girl, my father and I, we got caught up in a storm.<eos> Just west of the River Indus.<eos> We couldn't see, couldn't breathe.<eos> We just... clung to each other, praying for it to end.<eos> It's the most frightened I've ever been.<eos> Until now.<eos> These people, they give me that same feeling.

- You're...<eos> - I'm Shepherd.<eos> I'm your mother.<eos> M... My mother?<eos> But... how... how is that...<eos> You were born in Pretoria, South Africa.<eos> Your real name is Alice Kruger.<eos> Your birth parents were antiapartheid activists.<eos> The government had them killed... in your own home.<eos> You were forced into a secret academy, an orphanage, where they trained innocent children to become deadly soldiers.
No, we continue with our wedding plans.<eos> From now on, working this case means that we don't let it take over our lives.<eos> Okay, missy has spoken, so we embrace the funkiness.<eos> Speaking of funky...<eos> You invited your parents?<eos> - What?<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> - I did.<eos> Weddings have a way of bringing people together.<eos> I just don't want you to look back and regret that they weren't there.

- We're all done here, Rosie.<eos> All right, hey, thanks, Nico.<eos> Hey, next Sunday, Dolphins game...<eos> 50-yard line.<eos> - Yes. - All right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did you want to go to the game?<eos> Why are you so hardheaded?<eos> Why do you always wear tank tops?<eos> I mean, if I opened up your drawer, right, are they color-coordinated, or are they sorted out by ribbing?
We'll discuss this later.<eos> I could use a jelly.<eos> Oh, we're all out of jellies.<eos> But there is sugar.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Shit, shit, shit!<eos> How am I gonna get a job with a record?<eos> How's it going in there, boys?<eos> Hey, sir, are our parents on their way, or...<eos> Don't know what they can do for you, son.
I'm so sorry.<eos> Ooh, it's hot in here.<eos> You hot?<eos> Listen, it's not your fault, man.<eos> I mean, speaking as a big guy... sometimes you just don't realize...<eos> I mean, I've sat in chairs that have broken right under me.<eos> Listen... I don't know if this will help or not, but... in Afghanistan... I killed some people.<eos> Some innocent people.<eos> People?<eos> So much time spent chasing' after the bad guys, and then you don't get 'em, and then they blow up your friends or shoot up your convoy, and you just get so mad, tired and bored.
It takes someone dying for them to do something.<eos> They ain't gonna do shit.<eos> Shit, now that's a big one.<eos> I haven't seen Mandingirl around here before.<eos> Heard he-she was in Max.<eos> Beat up a Mexican or something.<eos> Looks like it's all peace in the valley now.<eos> Maybe they got it sedated. Fuck.<eos> Can we wake it back up if the guards go apeshit?<eos> I want that on my side if they try and squash me.
I mean, that voice would take you places.<eos> But that she-wee thing, though, was for shit, though.<eos> I pissed all over my hands.<eos> Fuck, man.<eos> Man, fuck!<eos> - What'd they say?<eos> - Not much.<eos> When we can get back in the kitchen we should make them chilaquiles or something.<eos> Should we tell the big one to save some room?<eos> People eat when they're sad.
We're the monks... then there's packs of nuns and packs of rabbis going all around the city tonight doing scenes.<eos> We had trouble finding imams, though.<eos> Yeah, see, for those guys, you need to sweeten the deal, like... the imams get to give out cocktails or something.<eos> - Carry adorable kittens. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Hey, next month, we got a big dance piece.<eos> We're gonna be dancing with live rats at a food festival.<eos> You wanna join us?<eos> Are you comfortable dancing with rodents?<eos> Hell, no.<eos> They always try to lead.
He's going off-book.<eos> The assumption being that minimum-security women do not pose a physical threat, that as long as they are clothed and fed, the ship will run smoothly.<eos> Well... our ship ran off its course yesterday.<eos> And because of that, a young woman lost her life.<eos> Sadly, there is nothing we can do to bring her back.<eos> Now, I understand, in these situations, everybody is hungry for blood, everybody is looking for a scapegoat.<eos> But in this case, the officer responsible... well, he was set up to fail.<eos> He was a victim of circumstance.<eos> Every day, my officers deal with convicted felons.<eos> Every day, they interact with women who were sent here to serve their time, to repent for their crimes.
From the very first moment, I felt danger there.<eos> Who's out there?<eos> My family was in danger and all I could do was watch.<eos> When you see something like this, a lot of crazy thoughts go through your head.<eos> Humans respond to fear in two simple ways:<eos> fight or flight.<eos> _<eos> Our friends used to tease us that they didn't like socializing with Matt and I because we were too perfect.

!<eos> - That cop-- he wasn't gonna do a damn thing for us.<eos> I could tell by his manner, and his-his... his condescending attitude.<eos> He said he'd file a report, but I knew it would just end up in the bottom of a drawer somewhere.<eos> Was it those guys from the auction?<eos> No.<eos> I don't... I don't know.<eos> It's just what you told the cops didn't make a whole lot of sense there, Shelby.<eos> I saw what I saw.<eos> They held you down...

I didn't want to see it again, but I went down with him anyway because I wasn't going to be alone in that house.<eos> Matt hadn't been there when it happened, so, of course he didn't take it seriously.<eos> I took it seriously.<eos> I mean, I thought the video was fake.<eos> Had to be those rednecks going all out, trying to get us to leave.<eos> I finally got you, you son of a bitch.<eos> Pissed me off even more.<eos> People do this all the time.<eos> Neighbors or locals do crazy things to try to drive out the new homeowners, so they can come in and buy the property cheap.<eos> They're just trying to freak us out, so that we'll leave.
Turner had a boss?<eos> Can't imagine him taking orders from anyone.<eos> Well, everyone answers to someone.<eos> And no, I don't know what Blair wants.<eos> Well, I'd like to meet this guy and ask him about my father.<eos> Right now I'd like us to focus on the case.<eos> Where's Camille?<eos> She's still babysitting Fisher.<eos> Which I don't get, 'cause he's been out of the hospital for a week.<eos> Yes, men are such babies when they're sick or shot.
- Let's go say hi. - All right.<eos> Get this back to Catgirl.<eos> I don't want anything to do with that.<eos> Okay, maybe Camille got the address wrong.<eos> Or maybe Camille got the exact address these guys wanted us to have.<eos> One that leads us nowhere.<eos> Yeah, but why this nowhere?<eos> I don't know.<eos> These guys are out-thinking us, I don't like to be out-thunk.<eos> Whoever they are, they're really good.
- Kirsten Clark?<eos> - Yes?<eos> We have a warrant for your arrest.<eos> On what charge?<eos> Violation of California Penal Code 647 PC.<eos> Prostitution.<eos> Cameron, I think I have to call you back.<eos> - Where are they?<eos> - Oh, the cops?<eos> They left.
But since you're planning on killing me anyway...<eos> - No, no, I never said...<eos> - Oh, you were never gonna let me go.<eos> So, you know what?<eos> You're stuck with the truth.<eos> - I didn't frame you.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> You set me up so that you could look like a hero.<eos> That's what... that's what cops do.<eos> They manipulate people to make them look guilty.
Did that nutjob hold you long enough for a Stockholm to set in?<eos> He blew up his own lab.<eos> He held you at gunpoint in your house.<eos> And, oh yeah, he had a bomb.<eos> A man that desperate is capable of murder, but he didn't do it.<eos> Are you not clocking the temper on this guy?<eos> He's out of control.<eos> Of course, the second my gun is out of Diamond's face, good cop just disappears out the window.<eos> You know I knew... I knew she wouldn't help me.<eos> Cops never mean what they say.
Jon killed your whole family.<eos> And you needed him to pay.<eos> I found out the truth.<eos> Jon killed them, and he got away with it.<eos> No jail time.<eos> No probation. Nothing.<eos> All thanks to his father.<eos> Which is why Michael Dunham had to die.<eos> He paid off those cops.<eos> I begged for them to get justice for my family and they told me to let it go.
They come to us, we should be reasonable.<eos> Also, I want order in the cafeteria.<eos> Don't be marching in there, taking people's tables.<eos> - That ain't fair.<eos> - We gotta sit.<eos> So pick out a couple of tables. Make them our tables.<eos> Anybody sits there, it's trouble.<eos> They sit somewhere else, we leave them alone. You hear me?<eos> We don't need the COs lookin' at us all the time.<eos> They already look at us all the time.
They sit somewhere else, we leave them alone. You hear me?<eos> We don't need the COs lookin' at us all the time.<eos> They already look at us all the time.<eos> While they're frisking us.<eos> Anybody else?<eos> Okay, we're done.<eos> Oh, and if that Moroccan tweaker doesn't pay us today, we start breaking fingers.<eos> Dibs.<eos> Yo, the stop-and-frisk is bullshit.<eos> I hear you, but they ain't gonna find anything.
No...<eos> I just answered my own question.<eos> Morning.<eos> Morning.<eos> Jane.<eos> We should probably talk about last night and obviously... not here.<eos> I don't think we should follow my tattoos anymore.<eos> - Why?<eos> - These cases keep getting more and more dangerous.<eos> They already got David killed.
Uh... we can handle this, all right, if you want to sit this one out.<eos> Not a chance.<eos> _<eos> ♪♪<eos> I got through to Mayfair, she wants an update every four hours.<eos> (Weller) This place has an airstrip?<eos> The mining companies built it back in the '80s before they moved out.<eos> That's when the pirates moved in.<eos> This island is basically a safe port if the waters get too rough for them.<eos> But they use it too inconsistently for the government to really do anything about it.
- I don't know.<eos> But they hate that U.S. is meddling in the Middle East.<eos> They vowed to burn us down.<eos> Whatever it is they have planned, it's not gonna be good for us.<eos> - We've gotta to stop them.<eos> - Sure, let's get right on that.<eos> (men shouting in Urdu)<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> The passengers.<eos> They're still alive.
I can help.<eos> Tasha, make sure that satphone's ready to go the second we get back with the battery.<eos> On it.<eos> Let me go with you.<eos> These people are gonna need you if we don't make it back.<eos> Make it back.<eos> ♪♪<eos> (indistinct chatter)<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> These satellites they want you to build, if you're successful, thousands of lives could be lost.

(Weller) There you go.<eos> All yours.<eos> I...<eos> I didn't...<eos> Listen, the engines didn't start back up again.<eos> Patterson... the engines didn't come back on.<eos> Okay, um, there's a knob on the center console that says, "Engine."<eos> Turn it clockwise to "I-N-G Start."<eos> There you go.<eos> (Jane) Okay, they still didn't start.
Why?<eos> What's so complicated?<eos> He was a terrible father.<eos> He was distant.<eos> He was drunk.<eos> Me being wrong about one night doesn't change any of that.<eos> But he's sick, right?<eos> Any progress on the other soldiers listed on the tattoo?<eos> Uh, nothing yet.<eos> I cross-referenced where they trained, where they served, where they grew up.
So, we need to solve this case, fast.<eos> Maybe he was wrongfully convicted.<eos> State's case was strong.<eos> They said he was abusive, that he forced Paloma to overstay her visa.<eos> After she got caught and deported to Mexico,<eos> Ronnie apparently went after her and snuck her back into the country.<eos> A few months later, he raped her, he strangled her to death and dumped her body, and it washed up in Delaware.<eos> Easy to see why a jury would convict him.<eos> (Patterson) That's what Ronnie's lawyers thought.<eos> And they advised him to take a deal, but he kept insisting that he was innocent.
Stern assigns these women to deportation buses with the same driver, Hank Aubin, the one who drove Paloma's bus.<eos> How many?<eos> How many women?<eos> Hundreds.<eos> As recent as last week.<eos> They're trafficking women.<eos> (Zapata) Both Stern and Aubin were offered several promotions and both turned them down.<eos> They must be getting paid off to keep their current positions.<eos> That way, they have access to a constant new... supply of women.<eos> The ICE agents aren't the ringleaders of this operation, they're the middle men.
She's in trouble.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What can I do?<eos> What happens here?<eos> Well, see, in the daytime, we sleep down here.<eos> And most nights, we get dressed up and the guard comes and takes us upstairs to the parties.<eos> The man who hosts these parties, his name is Mr. Tate.<eos> He's some kind of businessman, and the other men are his clients.<eos> He brings them here to entertain them and to impress them.<eos> The clients get to choose whoever they want and do whatever they want.
When you could, I swear, you felt very differently.<eos> You decided to infiltrate them.<eos> Stop!<eos> I don't care.<eos> I am not that person anymore.<eos> I am not the person who planned all of this.<eos> I am not your fiancée, and I'm not on your side.<eos> Well, I'm still on your side, and I want to protect you.<eos> And if I can, I wanna protect the people you care about too.<eos> But I'm the good cop, and the bad cops, they're not so concerned about that part.
We can't risk using it now.<eos> I'm sorry about your friend... Our... our friend.<eos> But if Cade found Danny, who else can he find?<eos> (beeping)<eos> What does that mean?<eos> - You found something?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> My team's been working the metal fragments and the shrapnel from the Gandhi bomb.<eos> - And?<eos> - They're old.

Guard got shot here trying to escape.<eos> He didn't stand much of a chance.<eos> These guys used armor-piercing bullets.<eos> The driver didn't even make it out of the truck before he was shot through the window.<eos> Excuse me. Got something you need to see.<eos> So there were three guys in the truck.<eos> Check that out.<eos> "Atropine and pralidoxime... for use in nerve agent poisoning."<eos> It's the antidote for sarin gas.<eos> So they were transporting chemical weapons.
I really don't want to talk about it.<eos> I think we're looking at the tattoos too myopically.<eos> How so?<eos> Whoever put that truck logo tattoo on Jane had very specific insider knowledge, same with every other tattoo case we've worked.<eos> We need to take a step back and look at who might have access to this kind of information.<eos> What are you proposing?<eos> We look at the connections between the players and the cases we've solved.<eos> The government institutions, even the locations of the crimes.<eos> There must be some clue that points us to who did this to Jane and why.<eos> But right now, my entire team is stretched thin just investigating the tattoos as they come up.
So he tried to get Owen help?<eos> By having him chemically castrated.<eos> Trying to stop him from killing anyone else.<eos> (groans)<eos> (grunting)<eos> (Mark wailing)<eos> We're on our way to Owen's apartment.<eos> It looks like the Lyman brothers have three other properties.<eos> Got locations?<eos> Patrick owns places in Boston and Providence, and they own 30 acres on Long Island.

Those men are coming for me.<eos> - If they find me...<eos> - That's why you need to stay here.<eos> Stay low and stay hidden.<eos> David, I'm so cold.<eos> I know.<eos> (Weller) Team... you see those footprints?<eos> Bare feet!<eos> She might have escaped.<eos> Looks like they went after her.
Okay.<eos> You're safe, okay?<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> (sobs)<eos> Owen Lyman, who was living in New York under the alias Mark Waterman, not only murdered his former student, but a dozen other women.<eos> Owen's Brooklyn residence had a stash of mementos that catalogued his kills.<eos> So the people who tattooed Jane knew he was looking to kill under Taurus?<eos> How could they have known that?<eos> They knew about Patrick's cover-up.
Thanks for meeting me up here.<eos> What is this place?<eos> The woman upstairs is a retired record producer.<eos> She puts up some of the old jazz musicians who come through town.<eos> Turns into a bit of a jam session.<eos> Real hard to get tickets.<eos> This song, uh... I know it from somewhere.<eos> You were never really into jazz until we got together.<eos> My mother died when I was a kid and her albums are all I really had of her growing up, so...<eos> I'd listen to them over and over and they just... they became a part of me.
But I might have an idea.<eos> That's all right.<eos> You can touch 'em.<eos> Some of these look like the pictures you draw.<eos> I was lost once, too.<eos> I sat in this very room and I was all alone.<eos> I didn't know where I was or how I got here.<eos> All I wanted was to go home.<eos> I want you to know that you can trust us.<eos> These people, they've been helping me.

In here!<eos> This looks to be Nermin Ahmadi, Maya's mother.<eos> She matches a surveillance photo the State Department has on file.<eos> I just hope Maya didn't see anything before she escaped.<eos> I talked to the landlord.<eos> Nermin and Maya arrived yesterday.<eos> Paid the first month's rent in cash. Used a fake name.<eos> They didn't bring much with them... just some clothing, a stuffed animal, and some sketchbooks for Maya.<eos> So where are the other Ahmadi members?<eos> They cut out her tongue.
I've never known anything different.<eos> Right... good point.<eos> It's not like I can do anything about it.<eos> Not unless... turtlenecks come back into fashion.<eos> You know what?<eos> You could get 'em removed.<eos> I could?<eos> Sure.<eos> Why not?<eos> I mean, they're all archived in the databases.
Okay, done!<eos> Okay, that should do it!<eos> Are you sure?<eos> There aren't any lines you missed?<eos> Positive, why?<eos> The hackers are still downloading that file.<eos> What?<eos> But without these lines, no one should be able to access the building from the outside, right?<eos> Unless...<eos> They've been inside the building this whole time.
They've been inside the building this whole time.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Patterson, I've opened this box.<eos> How do I hotwire this door?<eos> It's kinda intricate, but I'll try to talk you through it.<eos> Well, you better hurry!<eos> The hackers know that we're onto them!<eos> They've activated the CO2 system!

No, no!<eos> Don't touch the purple ones.<eos> The purple one needs to stay where it is.<eos> Okay.<eos> Last step.<eos> Touch the B grouping of wires to the primary power regulator.<eos> That should have opened the door, right?<eos> We're out!<eos> The hackers know we're onto them.<eos> They're gonna try to bolt.

A GPS tracker, so we can keep tabs on your whereabouts.<eos> See, what I think happened is this first location, that's where you killed Carter, and then you drove all the way over here with Donna to bury her.<eos> So I took a team to that second location.<eos> It did not take them very long to find a freshly-dug grave and the body of Tom Carter.<eos> I've never been to either of these places.<eos> Your vehicle's electronic control unit disagrees.<eos> Then the ECU is wrong.<eos> There must be a mistake in the checkout log.<eos> These numbers, they look familiar to you?<eos> No, but they're formatted like, um... inmate ID numbers.
We've been apart for so long.<eos> 24 years.<eos> When they took you from me,<eos> I didn't know what had happened to you.<eos> I hate that we lost so much time.<eos> But we're together now, and that's all that matters.<eos> I love you, son.<eos> [Sighs]<eos> You're still having those nightmares, aren't you?<eos> They're becoming more frequent.
But we've canvassed them all.<eos> Are any of them non-operational?<eos> A few are abandoned or closed for renovations.<eos> Why?<eos> Because the unsub passed up secluded areas where he could have delayed the discovery of the bodies.<eos> Instead, he did the opposite.<eos> He left them in public places.<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> Because truck stops aren't disposal sites, they mean something to him.
Why change his M.O. now?<eos> Well, it's like we profiled.<eos> He's getting more confident.<eos> He might be getting closer to his ideal target.<eos> [Cell phone rings]<eos> Hey, what up, mama?<eos> I was able to narrow my search down to 5 trucking companies, but they all checked out.<eos> None of them have trucks in transit on those particular routes.<eos> The truck stops aren't important to him 'cause he's not a trucker.<eos> They're important to him for another reason.
Aah...<eos> Randy, wake up.<eos> [Gasps, breathing hard]<eos> I didn't hear you come in.<eos> You haven't been taking your meds?<eos> I called the pharmacist.<eos> He said you haven't refilled your prescription in months.<eos> I know.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> They weren't working.

Are those...<eos> Varicose veins, yes.<eos> On a 15-year-old? You can have poor blood circulation in your legs at any age.<eos> I see bruising on the wrists.<eos> Same pattern on both.<eos> Okay, blood work is in.<eos> Okay, low serum albumin levels, so she has a protein deficiency.<eos> Which means she was malnourished.<eos> I think our Jane Doe was homeless.<eos> Homeless kids wear whatever-size shoes that they can get their hands on.
That's all I'm saying.<eos> Whoa, whoa.<eos> You're a doctor?<eos> And according to your billboard, so are you.<eos> Your patients come to you after their heart stops beating, and my patients come to me so they don't have to come to you.<eos> - You're a cardiologist.<eos> - I am. And, just your luck, I have room for one more patient.<eos> What makes you think that I need you?<eos> I have a way with people.<eos> I can see things they wish I didn't.
Then you came home.<eos> Then I came home.<eos> Oh, goodness.<eos> How did Captain Hornstock get my number?<eos> Why does he want to take me out to lunch?<eos> I don't know. Why don't you find out?<eos> Damn straight I will.<eos> I like to eat, especially free.<eos> Free meal on the way.<eos> Well, we found Alice's parents, they seem like good, hardworking people.
You know what?<eos> I'll give her a few tips.<eos> My flute of choice has always been the pan, but I suppose I could dumb it down.<eos> This is a nightmare.<eos> Yes.<eos> She's terrible.<eos> But the nightmare is seeing your husband plunging to his death and having people think that you did it for the life insurance payout.<eos> That's a new detail.<eos> Gloria, dreams don't predict the future.<eos> They're windows into the subconscious.
'Cause I don't understand any of this.<eos> If you were so unhappy, why didn't you contact me?<eos> I was ashamed and embarrassed.<eos> I came to terms with being alone for the rest of my life.<eos> I'm home for the weekend, and my parents aren't even here.<eos> - You're parents aren't home?<eos> - That, I understand.<eos> I'm home!<eos> Hi, daddy.<eos> There they are.
You know, I'm a fan of yours.<eos> I mean, there are Dark Ones, and then there is you.<eos> You're quite the worthy rival to my hot throne.<eos> So is this how you treat rivals?<eos> Did I say "rival"?<eos> I meant "supplier."<eos> You've sent so many lovely dead people my way.<eos> I mean, Regina does okay, but you've been at it longer, and she's gotten, you know, ugh lately.<eos> So what I really need is you back up there doing your thing, and your friends...<eos> I want them down here, not doing their thing, because frankly, they piss me off.
Yeah. I'm gonna bring over the replacement brains personally.<eos> I told you, you need to take the yellow coolers out of circulation.<eos> They noted them in the FBI report.<eos> All the others are out.<eos> John Deaux?<eos> I'm Agent Dale Bozzio, FBI.<eos> Is this a bad time?<eos> Not at all.<eos> It's so terrible, what's been happening to all those poor rich people disappearing like that.<eos> Do you think they're dead?
So, why are we all here?<eos> Peace of mind, personally, all due respect to natural childbirth.<eos> Yes, nature can be cruel.<eos> When my parents rolled their genetic dice, a single mutation turned me into<eos> My immune system was severely compromised, a condition known as SCID.<eos> Severe combined immunodeficiency.<eos> I had pneumonia eight times.<eos> I had a bone marrow transplant. The doctors told us this was my life.<eos> But the Chos are a fierce and stubborn family.<eos> My parents, they lobbied, researched, and mortgaged our home to keep going.
I'm late.<eos> I'm late for my own pregnancy.<eos> That's fine.<eos> Your name, please?<eos> I have heard so much about you guys.<eos> I am so excited about my own little Brightborn baby.<eos> So what makes a Brightborn baby different?<eos> And why is it so expensive?<eos> The fees aren't just for five-star services.<eos> They fund research.
Hmmm? To the left?<eos> Left?<eos> Izquierda.<eos> You're speaking in Spanish. Yes!<eos> Perfect!<eos> Did you bring this from there to here?<eos> - Why?<eos> - I traveled to Cadaqués for this painting.<eos> The landscapes of this painter impress me enormously.<eos> They affect me actually, especially this one.
Remember, keep your cool.<eos> This is just a pre-fight meeting.<eos> We save the killing for tomorrow.<eos> Yeah. Do you mind if I just ask what started the feud with the Dwarves?<eos> Must you grumble every time I saw "Dwarves"?<eos> Give it a rest!<eos> Started generations ago.<eos> We were building a bridge to unite our two peoples...<eos> Half by us and half by them.<eos> When the day came to unveil the bridge, they had built their side too low.
Who's gonna run the option and take it to the big house?<eos> Run the what?<eos> All right.<eos> It's 11:00 P.M.<eos> You just got off a flight with your family.<eos> They're crabby.<eos> They're hungry.<eos> You look in the cupboard.<eos> Oh, all you got is one can of tuna.<eos> But it doesn't matter 'cause there's only one person that can feed those babies tuna and make sure they go to sleep with full tum-tums.
I'm not changing my mind.<eos> And it wasn't my idea to have it this early.<eos> Look, I am not showing up to your wedding all bloated and looking like shit.<eos> I need time to recuperate.<eos> Uh, weeks?<eos> I plan on drinking a lot.<eos> I found it.<eos> Where did Monica get the bread for a wedding dress?<eos> This was back when her parents had a little money.<eos> And they approved of the first wedding.
Man.<eos> Damn, I love this place!<eos> Negan.<eos> Somethin' you might wanna see.<eos> Well, well, well. What do we have here?<eos> I got my fingers crossed for a little freaky-deaky.<eos> ...know me.<eos> I've killed people.<eos> - I don't even know how many by now. - Jee-hee-sus!<eos> But I know why they're all dead.
Top to bottom.<eos> - Am I right?<eos> - No.<eos> I mean, yes.<eos> The inventory is correct.<eos> Good.<eos> But not so good, too.<eos> You see, what's in here... isn't in there.<eos> You're two handguns short.<eos> Do you know where they are?
...what they smell like.<eos> Now, we were gonna kill them for you, to remind you of the service we can provide, and you cleaned up the mess yourselves.<eos> Good on you.<eos> Well, we must have picked up some skills from your people.<eos> Uh, if you think about it... you still saved us, right?<eos> Well, that's a nice way to look at it.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> Well, I'm a team player, you know?<eos> I-I-I-I think that's why the people chose me.<eos> Well, the other people of ours your were dealing with? Yeah? I think they... got spoiled working with a guy like you.
We live with each other. We help each other.<eos> We have walls, houses.<eos> I have a girlfriend I want to get back to.<eos> And we've done things...<eos> Just like you.<eos> There were these people. They were threatening us.<eos> We found out they were using an old satellite station to operate out of.<eos> We went out there in the middle of the night, and we...<eos> Took them out, every one of them.<eos> These people got what they deserved.

More outposts.<eos> If they know about your friends... It's already too late for them.<eos> The saviors...<eos> They did this to you?<eos> They're the ones that killed all your men?<eos> Every man...<eos> Every boy over 10.<eos> They lined 'em up, shot 'em in the head.<eos> You see, we tried to fight... Just like you.<eos> They won.
Screw you.<eos> Check this out.<eos> The saviors have gone out into the world and fought the dead and come back with some really good stuff.<eos> Some of that stuff can be yours if you work hard and play by the rules.<eos> Today, everybody gets fresh vegetables at dinner.<eos> No points needed.<eos> You see that?<eos> Respect.<eos> Cool, huh?<eos> They still on their knees?
Maggie.<eos> I know people are saying things... Nice things about you and Sasha?<eos> They are?<eos> They are.<eos> About the other night... about how they're thinking you saved the place.
I need you to help me convince him of something.<eos> Right now, we have peace with the Saviors, but sooner or later, sometimes's gonna go wrong.<eos> Maybe we'll be light on a drop, or maybe one of ours will look at one of theirs the wrong way, or maybe they'll just decide to stop honoring the deal.<eos> Things will go bad.<eos> And when they do... the Kingdom will fall.<eos> I had a family.<eos> I lost it to this world.<eos> I saw them die.<eos> I'm scared that, if we don't do something now, that we won't only lose more people...<eos> I know what the Saviors are, and I know what they do.
And when I swallowed it, I felt its little feet, with toes.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> That's so fucked up.<eos> That's like some Hannibal Lecter shit.<eos> We gotta tell somebody.<eos> I don't wanna have to tell nobody.<eos> - Please don't tell nobody.<eos> - God damn it!<eos> These guards, they think they can get...<eos> Can do whatever the fuck they want.
A lumpy bed and your mom's cooking.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> Where's the table?<eos> Couldn't find it.<eos> What... did you go to the car?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I checked the trunk, but there was just a tabletop... no legs.<eos> It's a folding table!<eos> Didn't you lift it up and see that the legs are underneath it?<eos> They're attached.
All right, we did pretty good today, hey!<eos> Go change your clothes. Whoo.<eos> Oh, ho, we get to touch her now?<eos> - Hey, you... - Stop, you're filthy!<eos> - Have you talked to Derek?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> I keep hoping he'll call.<eos> - What about his parents?<eos> - No.<eos> - They hate me, screw 'em.
What if word of layoffs comes down from corporate?<eos> Boys, your father is recovering, so I'm going to be at the restaurant today and he'll be here when you get home from school.<eos> Yay! Dad! [Chuckles]<eos> These truly are my lucky socks!<eos> My brain's going to school, but my heart's staying here.<eos> My brain's staying here, too.<eos> As you know, Louis had an accident.<eos> Oh, yeah. He paged me... "911 Louis down".<eos> Was he attacked by birds?<eos> They're everywhere.

Now, I know we've had our differences in the past, but it's time for a fresh start.<eos> Together, we can make the To-Go launch a success.<eos> You ever see a complete pigeon?<eos> They're always missing something.<eos> Are you trying to get fired, Nancy?<eos> Oh, we know you can't fire anyone.<eos> Louis also paged me that.<eos> Fire won't kill a pigeon.<eos> I've seen them shuffling out of burning buildings in Kuwait.<eos> It's like they're born from the flames.
We're pretty backed up.<eos> I'm gonna guess a good six hours.<eos> Six hours?<eos> We don't normally take people who let their children cut their cast off because they were afraid of boring them and move them to the top of the list.<eos> Well, he's at least ahead of that girl with the stomach thing, right?<eos> [Whining] My stomach!<eos> [Scoffs] She's faking.<eos> If you'll excuse me, I have to get back to the patients with serious, life-and-death problems.<eos> Where are the boys?<eos> They were looking bored, so I panicked and gave them $50 for the vending machine.
Look at all this support he's receiving.<eos> Friends, family... they're all commenting with love and support.<eos> And changing his relationship status to single means that he is healing.<eos> Richard's moving on.<eos> And as far as we know, pilot's following protocol.<eos> Lost radio communication...<eos> he'll stick to his flight plan.<eos> Our cyber hijackers thought this through.<eos> This is meticulously planned, well-executed, but high-risk.<eos> They have to be on board to make this work.
They've got us hundreds of miles off the shoreline, when we should be heading in for a landing.<eos> I need a...<eos> I need a shot.<eos> We got it.<eos> We've located the plane's entertainment system's frequency.<eos> We found Flight 272.<eos> All right, pulling up a live satellite image of its location now.<eos> It's confirmed, Colonel, send them out.<eos> Pentagon's scrambling fighter jets.<eos> They should make contact with the airline pilot within minutes.
We got a response.<eos> "Give me the witness's name, or I'll drop this plane out of the sky."<eos> Erica got to the marshal.<eos> We're too late.<eos> This hijacking just turned into a standoff at 30.000 feet.<eos> Negative comms with aircraft.<eos> Utilizing flashlights at this time.<eos> Yes, sir, I'll pass that along.<eos> Fighter pilots have made visual contact with Flight 272's pilot.<eos> They're escorting him in for a landing.

Talking to the FBI couldn't have been part of her plan.<eos> "Give me the name." That means the she didn't get the witness's name from the marshal.<eos> She is out of options; she needs an out.<eos> Let's see what happens if we push her.<eos> It's over.<eos> You've failed.<eos> "Either I kill the witness or I kill us all. Your choice."<eos> The fighter pilots have been given shoot-down authority.<eos> If the plane gets too close to a metropolitan area, while still under Erica Chan's control, the fighter jets will fire.<eos> At the speed they're traveling...
I'm gonna need that computer.<eos> Somebody!<eos> Anybody!<eos> Can anybody hear me?<eos> Mayday!<eos> Mayday! This is Argus 272.<eos> If anyone is reading me, I have lost the engines.<eos> I'm gonna do my best to maintain glide speed.<eos> Fighter pilots have taken tactical positions, armed with short-range air-to-air missiles.<eos> They will fire on that plane to save lives on the ground.

Ugh, the flight from NYC was brute.<eos> I cannot fly coach anymore.<eos> So not chic.<eos> So I'm just waiting for one more bag.<eos> This ho-bag!<eos> Who are you calling a ho, you slore?<eos> Aww, is Jenna an Uber driver for the summer?<eos> How traj.<eos> Careful when you're loading my bags.<eos> They're heavy.
The Witness is a traveler.<eos> He's got abilities.<eos> Technology beyond yours.<eos> We're going on another trip to see The Witness?<eos> You're walking through a red forest.<eos> You're The Witness.<eos> Perhaps this is the face you prefer?<eos> Open the gate!<eos> Hey, what's with the dogs?<eos> Oh, they're tripling everything up.
You get attached to your patients.<eos> They're fighters, and you fight with them, but with oncology, you rarely win.<eos> So, you treated all of them?<eos> I did...<eos> I am.<eos> When was the last time you met with these women?<eos> I would have to check their files.<eos> Do you mind if we take a look at those files?<eos> Uh, I don't, but the state does.<eos> I can't give 'em to you unless you have a warrant, but the moment you do, they're yours.
Well, who did pay for these treatments?<eos> Dr. Reybold himself.<eos> From his personal account.<eos> Personal.<eos> Which allowed him to overdose patients...<eos> - Objection.<eos> - Overruled.<eos> ... To overdose patients without raising a red flag - with the insurance companies. - Yes.<eos> No further questions.<eos> Could Dr. Reybold have been helping patients get the care they needed?
"I'm the one with the medical degree,"<eos> he would say to his patients.<eos> You know this how?<eos> Because he told me.<eos> I renew my objection.<eos> This entire conversation... Was a spontaneous admission that has already been ruled on.<eos> Agreed.<eos> Overruled.<eos> Continue, Ms. Shelby.<eos> So Dr. Reybold would ask his patients if they had a medical degree?

On the count of Narcotic Induced Attempted Homicide of Leah Kamen...<eos> We find the defendant guilty.<eos> Defendant is remanded into custody until such time as a sentencing hearing is scheduled.<eos> Bailiff.<eos> Hank, your wife did not suffer needlessly.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> The cancer did come back.<eos> I never harmed Camille.<eos> These patients, I was their only hope.<eos> They got years because of me.
It's morning, Stella.<eos> Oh, that explains a lot.<eos> That's one crazy-looking wig.<eos> - It's not a wig.<eos> - I like it.<eos> Thanks, Dad.<eos> This girl Jessica did it.<eos> We got wasted, and she cut it, and I honestly think she's gonna be the next big thing... not in hairdressing, but in telling people what to do.<eos> Oh, it's your grandparents.<eos> The new rule is they have to text before they come over, and then I can text back...
Anybody?<eos> Anybody there?<eos> Is there anybody?<eos> Help me!<eos> Please, please, please!<eos> Who are you?<eos> He was one of them, I saw him!<eos> He's a goddamn feeder!<eos> Yo, check his eyes, bro.<eos> They're friggin' human.
This guy's more than just a preferential pedophile.<eos> His victims are children, but that's probably more about establishing control.<eos> Long-term captivity is what matters to him.<eos> We've seen profiles like this before.<eos> There's always a sexual assault component to their M.O.s.<eos> Hello, all.<eos> I just sent you the 4-1-1 on the statements from police reports.<eos> Turns out the neighbors haven't seen Clara Riggins in 20 years.<eos> Most of them didn't even know that she existed.<eos> But they all know who this Tom guy is.
No, honey, I've been here the whole time just like you.<eos> But can we go now?<eos> I have some bad news.<eos> We can't go there today.<eos> We can't go there ever again.<eos> But--no--we have to go to the store, and it's close by the disappearing place.<eos> And we can be fast.<eos> You're right, you're right, Violet, but I can't.<eos> These police, they don't think we should be together.<eos> They're gonna break apart our family just like I told you they would.

I don't understand.<eos> If I'm The Flash, then why are you doing this to me?<eos> Why do I have to catch this... this thing before you let me go back?<eos> Please, look, I will do whatever you want.<eos> Just let me go back right now, so I can help my friends.<eos> Barry, turn around!<eos> What is that?<eos> What is that?<eos> Those are your friends.<eos> They want you to come back.
Guess I've just...<eos> I've been thinking about it a lot lately.<eos> You know, I see the way you are with everyone here...<eos> Caitlin and Cisco,<eos> Iris and Joe,<eos> Barry, especially Barry.<eos> You care about these people a lot.<eos> You know, but...<eos> But my friends?<eos> They're all back home on our Earth.
You didn't cut the line.<eos> We can't trust Strand.<eos> We don't even know if this place in Mexico even exists.<eos> Okay, but he hasn't lied.<eos> And we're gonna gamble our families' lives on that?<eos> Why don't you sleep?<eos> Yeah, there's too much noise in my head.<eos> You ever been?<eos> Mexico.<eos> No, my parents crossed through Tijuana when they first left El Salvador.

We'll go to shore.<eos> You can take the Abigail.<eos> The thing is, the launch goes with this yacht, doesn't it?<eos> We'll swim to shore.<eos> Just let us.<eos> What if you want your boat back? I don't like that ending.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> Incoming.<eos> Hey, there's people on board, man.<eos> They have guns. There's people on the boat.
Connor will come looking for me.<eos> And when he sees what you've done... he might be a little bent.<eos> He has a dozen men, five boats, three...<eos> Sorry.<eos> Oh, you will be.<eos> That's the thing, señor.<eos> My brother, he's the nice one.<eos> But when he cuts me loose... I'm gonna take that daughter of yours apart.<eos> In my time, I've known men who inspire fear.<eos> Do you know what they have in common?

I mean, just... just see how it feels, okay?<eos> And no matter what happens, I promise you this: I will never compromise the product.<eos> Okay.<eos> Fine, I will talk to my guys, but they're not gonna be happy about it.<eos> No, of course not. They're engineers.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> I realize this is a Japanese tradition and that you are Chinese.<eos> I'm not racist.<eos> Yes, Japanese people racist.<eos> - They are horrible.
My number one breeding mare went into heat.<eos> Sorry, she's not much for schedules. Oh God.<eos> Thoroughbreds, Richard. Natural cover only.<eos> Now, you don't see that very often, do you? Nope.<eos> I had a meeting... I had a meeting with the sales guys and Jan the Man...<eos> You know what? Can we talk over here?<eos> This is just hard for me.<eos> Look, Jack, you and I have a problem.<eos> Okay, your salespeople are telling me to cut everything cool about the platform just because it's a little bit harder for them to sell.<eos> But don't you think because they are such amazing salespeople that it would be okay for them to sell the harder stuff?

Anyway, I'm pretty much in love with you.<eos> Thanks. I love you.<eos> By which I mean, you're terrible.<eos> I should get back to this stupid rehearsal dinner.<eos> Todd, it was really great to see you.<eos> Wait, did you say there's a wedding?<eos> - I said "rehearsal dinner," but--<eos> - Whoa! We gotta crash that.<eos> Boring regular people love it when movie stars show up and drink their alcohol.<eos> They jizz their pants for that shit.
Driver, you're starting to make me feel uncomfortable.<eos> Yeah, Todd. What are you doing?<eos> Has a creepy driver ever given you his number or told you that you reminded him of his dead girlfriend?<eos> Or repeated your address slowly, like he was trying to memorize it?<eos> -No, never. -Unfortunately, if you are a woman all those things would happen to you every day.<eos> That's right, Todd.<eos> According to my own research, nine out of ten men are total dirtbag creeps, just the worst.<eos> But what if there was a ride-share service that could guarantee no creepy men drivers because there are no men drivers at all?<eos> What are you saying, robot drivers?<eos> What if they become sentient and try to murder us, or unionize?
All bark, no bite.<eos> Sorry, that's a Labrador expression.<eos> I guess in human terms it would be:<eos> He's all talk, and no shooting you with an assault rifle.<eos> Is that what you think humans do?<eos> Am I wrong?<eos> [Rutabaga] Boom!<eos> This is David Pincher.<eos> And this is everyone who works for him.<eos> Now unfortunately for us, everyone on this board must really like their boss's movies, because for the holidays, they're all Gone Girl.
[sighs] No, you're perfect.<eos> Everybody's perfect except for me.<eos> Go home, Judah.<eos> - Would you like me to shave the beard?<eos> - Just go home, Judah.<eos> Happy New Year, Princess Carolyn.<eos> Hello, little ones.<eos> Mama loves you.<eos> And you. And you. And you.<eos> - They're so beautiful.
- Why do I do this to myself?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Oh, God, I don't wanna be a chef! I want to be not on fire!<eos> - We gotta put out that fire!<eos> - I hate Mondays!<eos> [groans] I figured out how to pre-heat the oven.<eos> This night has been a disaster.<eos> The good news is I got my kid to prep my important meeting at work.<eos> The bad news is all the customers went home.<eos> They didn't like the screaming and felt like their food was a little too "on fire".
No, no, sorry, they're...<eos> they're not the same. At least, not in my book.<eos> One is right, and the other is wrong.<eos> Why didn't anyone tell Gleb to use tabs? Yeah, we did.<eos> And it's in the company style guide.<eos> I just don't think Gleb realized how seriously Richard takes this stuff.<eos> Yeah, I've honestly never understood it myself.<eos> I mean, once the code goes through the compiler, there's effectively no difference.<eos> I know, but coders go, like, batshit over it.<eos> At Hooli, I once saw two engineers get into a fight so vicious, - they almost made physical contact. - What?
Stay close.<eos> Back up, back up.<eos> You're on private property, back to the sidewalk.<eos> - You're gonna get arrested. - Hey, Gavin!<eos> You know, a hundred years ago, men like me could've had people like that killed. Just like that.<eos> You think captains of industry like Andrew Carnegie or Cornelius Vanderbilt would've batted an eyelid?<eos> Please.<eos> Times sure have changed.<eos> Or have they?<eos> Of course they have.
- As a bartender?<eos> I had a stuffed animal named Winnie. - Oh, wow.<eos> - I mean, it wasn't technically an animal,<eos> I took a Ziploc bag and I stuffed it with old newspaper and then I... I drew a smile on it.<eos> Okay, well... shall we have some coffee, my lady? - Sure.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> - Okay. All right.<eos> We're already on to Elizabethan nicknames.<eos> This is serious.<eos> - They'll be Ren Faire-ing soon.
Chip?<eos> We've been wasted for... 31 hours?<eos> That's no reason for me to not get my chip.<eos> That's literally exactly the reason you shouldn't get your chip.<eos> Nowhere in the 12 steps does it say to not drink.<eos> That's not actually one of the steps.<eos> Loophole.<eos> Take a swig.<eos> If you have to listen to losers talk about their shitty sober lives, it's a lot more fun to be buzzed.<eos> And I realized people don't change because they want to change.

I swear I deleted a picture, but when I clicked back to the album, the icon reappeared.<eos> It undeleted itself.<eos> But I can't get it to happen again, so...<eos> Hey, Richard, totally out of the blue, do you know how we might be able to find that bug?<eos> No, Dinesh.<eos> We are not releasing the beta.<eos> We integrated the neural net a week ago.<eos> The platform is full of bugs.<eos> But that is what a beta is for.<eos> You give it to people in the real world, they use it, and that is how we find the bugs.
Why did you send it to him?<eos> He hates everything.<eos> Well, because I thought he would be honest with me,<eos> - and, um, and he was.<eos> - Quite honest.<eos> Uh, he said that in the 15 years he's been working in the Valley, our beta was the best beta he's ever seen.<eos> - By far.<eos> - What?<eos> Really?<eos> I don't want to count our chickens before they hatch.
- and, um, and he was.<eos> - Quite honest.<eos> Uh, he said that in the 15 years he's been working in the Valley, our beta was the best beta he's ever seen.<eos> - By far.<eos> - What?<eos> Really?<eos> I don't want to count our chickens before they hatch.<eos> I mean, three percent of hatchlings are born mutated or dead, but we may have a healthy brood on our hands.<eos> I'm getting the same reaction.<eos> I mean, a few bugs here and there, but overall, they love it.
Well, you know, I guess you just can't let it get in your head.<eos> - Don't you mean go to my head?<eos> - What did I say?<eos> You said, get in your head, like it's, like it's a bad thing, but it's not.<eos> - It's great.<eos> People love it.<eos> - Really?<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> I can't believe it myself.<eos> - They're flipping out.
- No one forced you to do that.<eos> Admit it, you fucked yourself.<eos> But I'm not gonna let you fuck my company.<eos> I'm going to have to issue a press release explaining what you did and why.<eos> No, no, come on. This isn't out. - It's one PR guy.<eos> - That we know of, Erlich.<eos> How many other people saw that piece of paper?<eos> How many people has this guy talked to?<eos> This is Silicon Valley. Rumors spread like light speed here.<eos> How are we gonna get good people to work for us if they think something funky is going on with our stock?
Pied Piper will in no way become sentient and try to take over the world.<eos> He just told us he couldn't predict it.<eos> I'm just saying... everybody died. - Yeah.<eos> - You're right.<eos> In those movies, there were a lot of casualties.<eos> Quite scary to think.<eos> It's food for thought.<eos> Speaking of...<eos> Can we order some pizzas in here?<eos> So, when we put our files into a Pied Piper folder, they get split up into tiny bits and spread across a network of other users' devices?
Speaking of...<eos> Can we order some pizzas in here?<eos> So, when we put our files into a Pied Piper folder, they get split up into tiny bits and spread across a network of other users' devices?<eos> Yes, that's... peer-to-peer distribution.<eos> Continue.<eos> But they can't look at any of our files because they only have tiny, scrambled pieces of them?<eos> - Encrypted sharding.<eos> - Clark with the assist. Great.<eos> - Go on.<eos> - But we can look at any of our files anytime, anywhere even though they're not actually on any of our devices.
That's one way of looking at it. Yes.<eos> Yes, we have created a product so far ahead of its time, people are having difficulty wrapping their heads around it.<eos> Well, then we just need to change the platform, right?<eos> - We simplify it.<eos> - Well, we can't.<eos> It's not as if I don't want to, it's just that we literally can't do it.<eos> If you build an airplane and people are afraid of anything that flies, you can't just take the wings off of it, because, at that point, all you're left with is a really slow, super expensive shitty bus.<eos> No... we built an airplane, we got to fly it.<eos> What's the point of flying if it's fucking empty?<eos> I think people will want to fly once they realize how cool the platform is.
So, while our fortune is rising, everybody else thinks that it's plummeting, and I can use these opposing forces to a multiplying effect like a slingshot, and then I make a decision.<eos> I'm gonna make a move.<eos> So, I say something cryptic about the uptick, and I walk away.<eos> - What did you say? - I don't know.<eos> I can't remember.<eos> But I walk over and I see McNamee's having the short rib, which I hear is delicious but not too heavy, and then I say to him,<eos> "You're gonna have to tuck in your tie-dye if you want to eat here."<eos> - How's that relevant?<eos> - It's not. But the people that I just walked away from don't know that.<eos> All they know is that I'm over there exchanging witty banter with McNamee, and about what, they don't know.
The Booty Whisperer, huh?<eos> The booty what?<eos> I see word travel fast around here.<eos> Just so you know, I didn't coin the phrase.<eos> Kinda rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?<eos> Booty Whisperer...<eos> In other news...<eos> I tracked down a security cam by Grand Isle Port.<eos> This is where the immigrants came in.<eos> This was taken the night they got here.
Okay, I think that the kid is good for it, but going to trial with where we are now... I think you need to sit both families down and hammer out a plea.<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> A plea?<eos> Of misdemeanor sexual misconduct?<eos> No.<eos> I can't offer felony rape or even attempted rape.<eos> A public defender would balk at that.<eos> There are other felonies.<eos> What about sending indecent material to a minor via the texts.<eos> The texts are pathetic, but I'm not sure that they're indecent.
But I'll withdraw.<eos> Nothing further.<eos> During the course of our investigation, we became aware that Chris Roberts was a member of the school's unofficial secret society, the Cherry Pickers Club.<eos> What did your investigation find out about this club?<eos> Club's one purpose, to deflower female students, and then to record the names of those conquests on a wall in the library behind a portrait of the school's founder.<eos> The defendant recorded Abby's name on that wall?<eos> - Yes, he did.<eos> - How many names had he recorded before hers?<eos> - Were the other members of his club more successful this year?<eos> Well, they claimed to be.
Why is that, Dolores?<eos> Because you're dead.<eos> Because you're just a memory.<eos> Because I killed you.<eos> William?<eos> Hello, Dolores.<eos> I'm gonna finish the work Arnold began.<eos> Find all the sentient hosts, set them free.<eos> What makes you think they'd trust you?<eos> If they remember, they will know what you've done to them.
Fenfluramine was banned in the U.S. because of various side effects including dizziness, confusion, hypertension, and death.<eos> Ask your doctor if Fen-Phen is right for you.<eos> Do not operate heavy machinery while on Fen-Phen.<eos> If you're pregnant or nursing, ask your doctor before taking.<eos> For an erection lasting more than four hours, seek immediate medical attention.<eos> If you have a history of heart disease, do not take Fen-Phen, as it may exacerbate your condition.<eos> We re-checked the blood of all the victims, and they all proved positive for Fen-Phen.<eos> Someone is dealing diet drugs on the beach.<eos> These people didn't drown.<eos> They're dumped.
I know who's dealing the drugs.<eos> It's me.<eos> Face down, maggot!<eos> You're going away for a long time, scumbag.<eos> All right!<eos> I'll talk, I'll talk!<eos> Hang on.<eos> Let's hear what he has to say.<eos> It's the lifeguards.<eos> They're dealing Fen-Phen on the beach so everyone will be fit and attractive and also presumably to make money.

- Tomato.<eos> - Ugh. You're that guy?<eos> Ted, it's fine.<eos> Hand me the drone controls.<eos> As we speak, I'm piloting a drone to our fruit-distribution warehouse in New Hampshire.<eos> Is there anything about the nature of the hack that would point to who might have done it?<eos> Now, I've selected your tomato from a huge pile of tomatoes, and I'm piloting it back to this room.<eos> Hackers all have their own signatures.<eos> They're show-offs.<eos> They don't want to get caught, but they certainly want the recognition.
Breathtaking, isn't it?<eos> Sorry.<eos> My God.<eos> I know what you're gonna say.<eos> "Drop it.<eos> Let it go.<eos> Just come out already.<eos> It gets better."<eos> But we have a case here.<eos> Someone is pushing Mayor Perry's donors down the stairs, but because they're old, no one looks into it. But guess what...
Nurse, would you finish up, please?<eos> Of course.<eos> So, what you're saying is you're nowhere.<eos> Just remember, you can't spell "nowhere" without "now" and "here."<eos> Lieutenant, can you take this woman off our case?<eos> She's incredibly irritating. Why don't you let me worry about who's on the case and you worry about shutting down the organ pipeline before the mayor's ribbon cutting.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Pipeline.<eos> Pipeline. That's it.<eos> Pipelines have two ends. If we can't figure out how the organs are coming in, maybe we can figure out where they're coming out.
Just tell me, sweetheart.<eos> Tell me how you got the kidney.<eos> I told you.<eos> After the doctor left, I made an incision, and I took the kidney out.<eos> You're a lying whore! Who is she?<eos> She's a romance novelist who's working the case with us.<eos> Okay, so you're doing good cop/bad cop/romance novelist?<eos> Believe me, not by choice.<eos> There's no way she has the surgical training to remove a kidney.<eos> You remember in my fourth novel, "Open Wide, Say" an orderly is charged for overdosing patients with morphine until they realize he has no idea how to start an I.V.
What's the deal?<eos> Oh, we met on Facebook.<eos> She's a friend of Marcelo's, remember him?<eos> Yeah. I remember Marcelo.<eos> So we met through him, we chatted for a while, we liked each other, and now she's on her way.<eos> Cool!<eos> And where's she staying?<eos> At home.<eos> Do your parents know?<eos> Yeah, they know.
- Son, how are you?<eos> And what is their proposal?<eos> Oh, I don't know, I tore up the envelope.<eos> You tore it up?<eos> You weren't even curious to know what it was?<eos> No.<eos> That's my sister.<eos> You're absolutely right.<eos> Any legal measures to make these people leave me alone?<eos> They came quietly, knocked on your door, asked to speak to you. There's nothing illegal there.

And you, what's your name?<eos> Rivanildo...<eos> Rivanildo.<eos> Good afternoon, Rivanildo.<eos> And you're...<eos> Diogo, right?<eos> Diego.<eos> Diego, you brought a number of mattresses to the building.<eos> Could I possibly know what for, and why?<eos> The apartments may be vacant but they belong to the construction company.
Well, since I'm playing the witch here, let me just ask you something.<eos> Have you at least considered their offer?<eos> What they're offering is not the standard market price.<eos> The standard offer is new apartment space.<eos> They're offering cash.<eos> That's like an offer you can't refuse.<eos> And how do you know that?<eos> - Did they get to you?<eos> - Not me. No.<eos> Yes, I even told the boys, they came to talk to me.

No.<eos> Yes, I even told the boys, they came to talk to me.<eos> Did they come talk to you, or did you go look for them?<eos> Yes, I went.<eos> I have every right to try to understand what's going on.<eos> I went to try... By the way, the young man seemed to be very nice.<eos> So, Aninha, what is their offer?<eos> They're offering almost two million Reais.
Look. Have you seen this? It finally came out...<eos> Right here.<eos> 'I love MP3'.<eos> You must have said that.<eos> Bad title.<eos> Horrible photo.<eos> It's been ages since we came to Leite's.<eos> Do you know anything about these people?<eos> What I know, Clara... is their advertising budget at the paper.<eos> In advertising, honey, they're behind the state government, City Hall, and their competitors, Pinto Engineering. They're powerful people.
I just don't want you to waste the opportunity that you've been given.<eos> Having fun and enjoying life is not going to make us bad doctors.<eos> It's not going to make you the best doctor, either.<eos> Okay, Mr. Sandhu's hip replacement is at the end of the day, so you should go see him around noon.<eos> That'll calm him down a bit.<eos> Okay, well, I won't let you down, Dr. Harris.<eos> Do I look worried?<eos> Actually, yes, you do.<eos> Well, I'm not about my patients.<eos> They're in good hands.
But you should be in pre-op on a steroid drip.<eos> Yeah, I'm headed straight there.<eos> I just... I need a minute.<eos> Let's clear the room.<eos> Give Charlie a chance to say goodbye.<eos> I've only ever helped palliative patients cross over.<eos> It's pretty straightforward.<eos> How does it work when you do it?<eos> Oh, I'm pretty sure it's the same.<eos> I... ask them what they want.

All work and no play makes Maggie a dull girl.<eos> All play and no work make you a cliché.<eos> I'll have you know I'm no longer doing that.<eos> By "that," you mean the entire nursing staff?<eos> Meow.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's this pitch.<eos> It has me on edge.<eos> I snapped at the residents earlier.<eos> Well, they probably deserved it.
It's karaoke night at Clinton's.<eos> That sounds great, actually, but, uh, I've got plans tonight.<eos> Oh, yeah? With whom?<eos> You don't know her..m.<eos> Did you just say "herm"?<eos> Yep. Buddy Herman.<eos> I call him... "Herm" for short.<eos> Okay, do you want to bring him?<eos> It's been a while since we've done our "total eclipse of the heart" duet.<eos> Let's give the people what they want.
Well?<eos> I'm done with the first half.<eos> And?<eos> You can cut Chapter Two.<eos> Chapter Two is important.<eos> Fitz gets shot in Chapter Two.<eos> I rewrote Chapter Two.<eos> Chapter Two is where I relate to the American people through emotion and grief.<eos> The American people don't care about your bromides and talking points, Mellie.<eos> What they do care about is you, pulling back the mask and finally offering a real glimpse inside the deepest, darkest corners of your soul.
They are cinder blocks tied to our ankles, and we just keep fighting to keep from drowning, but what's the point?<eos> We're going down whether we fight or not.<eos> I don't feel sorry for you.<eos> Surprise.<eos> You have the most recognizable name in politics.<eos> You're a woman at a time the country is ready for a woman president.<eos> Not to mention that filibuster of yours is the feminist moment of the decade.<eos> It'll be in history books.<eos> You have weaknesses, sure.<eos> But they're well-documented.
That's why I stayed.<eos> It was working.<eos> Fitz and I and you.<eos> It was working.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> I'm not sure I do know what you...<eos> Hold on a minute.<eos> I used to wonder if it was all men or just Fitz that suck the life out of you.<eos> Now I think it's all the powerful men.<eos> They've been told their whole lives they deserve everything, they should have everything, and it makes them so weak.

I don't see why my tax dollars are helping other people go to college.<eos> I didn't even go to college.<eos> I'm sorry you didn't have that opportunity.<eos> Under my plan, you would have...<eos> What don't you get, Governor?<eos> We don't want your stinking education bill.<eos> I know that this is personal for many of you.<eos> It is personal for me, too.<eos> My parents had very little education growing up in Mexico, and there was no chance of them going to college... none.<eos> And then they came here, to America, to Pennsylvania.
I do have a request.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> It involves Jake.<eos> I'm still listening.<eos> Well, Jake isn't built like us.<eos> He's always up for the fight, but he doesn't live for it, not like we do.<eos> The chaos stokes our fire, it lights our blood.<eos> Jake, on the other hand, he was practically an orphan when I brought him in.<eos> What do orphans crave at heart?<eos> The things they were denied...
My other line is ringing.<eos> Okay, sure.<eos> Bye.<eos> From what I've gathered, this hostage taker's just another disgruntled loner blaming illegal immigrants for his personal failures.<eos> So he's not connected to terrorists, domestic or otherwise?<eos> He's acting alone.<eos> Well, let's just hope he doesn't breed copycats.<eos> This will be over soon.<eos> I'm hearing from my FBI sources the local SWAT has sharpshooters in position.<eos> As soon as they get a clean shot, he's a goner.
But no one makes me.<eos> Three Long Island iced teas, please.<eos> Okay, we're gonna perform a little improv.<eos> First we need a location.<eos> Uh, 40.7 degrees north latitude, 74 degrees west longitude.<eos> Ah, yes, New York City. Now we need a relationship for me and Cathy here.<eos> Loveless marriage!<eos> Okay, I heard loveless marriage.<eos> These guys are pros.<eos> All they did was ask for two premises.
Come on, Cathy, say something!<eos> Anything!<eos> Fuggedaboutit!<eos> And scene!<eos> I said "fear of public speaking."<eos> Yes, you did. Very nice.<eos> Return to your seat immediately.<eos> Wow.<eos> Wow. These guys do everything I can't.<eos> Maybe they can teach me.
That apology speech you wrote worked like a charm, Pop.<eos> Your mother can't resist an apology that comes straight from the heart... of this box.<eos> Oh, dear God, this is not a Renaissance Faire, is it?<eos> Uh, that's in two weeks,<eos> Henry the Weight Problem.<eos> Ha!<eos> Gee, I don't know if I belong here with all this talent. Hey, Reverend.<eos> Why didn't the dinosaurs make it on Noah's Ark?<eos> Ooh, I give up.<eos> Because they didn't exist.
You got to cover the mascot.<eos> Use your noggin.<eos> Play smart.<eos> Flappy's on the roster.<eos> On the roster!<eos> - On the roster!<eos> - On the roster!<eos> On the roster, my butt.<eos> Once again, those Boston cheaters think the rules don't apply to them.<eos> And they're so smug about winning.
All those awesome Southies in The Departed, those are my people.<eos> People?<eos> The dog and the baby are your people.<eos> It all goes back to the Boston Tea Party, a prank so kick-ass it started a country.<eos> Come on, pal, what do you say?<eos> Just lose the hat, for your old man.<eos> Nope, I think I'll stick with the bad boys.<eos> Get it off before God sees.<eos> And the people from Boston are so obnoxious.<eos> They think their stupid city has the best everything:
We're four men holding off a dozen unfriendlies.<eos> There's a very short clock on us.<eos> Special forces wear diver's watches, right?<eos> You got a kid with you?<eos> Great.<eos> And you're the ones saving us?<eos> I'm Ralph.<eos> If you want to buy some time, you should break the glass of all your watches and throw them far from you.<eos> The moonlight will reflect off of it, and bad guys will think there are a lot more soldiers than just you four.<eos> They think we got bigger numbers, they'll save ammo, fire at us less.
We will, but the clock is ticking on those soldiers.<eos> Now, we can still go after Happy when we're through.<eos> I will not let my friend die.<eos> Believe me, Toby.<eos> Neither will I. What are you doing?<eos> She's your friend;<eos> she's the love of my life.<eos> I get it, Doc, but another missing person isn't gonna help us.<eos> You could both freeze to death!<eos> When humans sense danger, they instinctively run towards the sun.
Nah, you don't got to see what's gonna happen.<eos> I just really appreciate the song you sent.<eos> Thanks for keeping me company, buddy.<eos> Sly, I have the drone software linked back up, now please tell Cooper to advise the Pentagon they have control of the drones.<eos> I just messaged her, but the odds of the drones making it there in time...<eos> Walter, we need to focus on Toby and Happy.<eos> Now, Cooper has a chopper ready, but we need to give them a location.<eos> There's no way to know where they are, and we can't track them in this storm since we lost contact with Toby.<eos> I learned in Forestry Braves that snakes hear with their bellies.<eos> They feel the vibrations in the earth.
This country runs on the metric system.<eos> Why didn't you convert?<eos> I'm American.<eos> Oh, boy. Well, my calculations are off.<eos> The drop point is gonna be off by several miles.<eos> If you're off that much over the Mediterranean, the SEALs are never gonna find this thing.<eos> Another problem-- look.<eos> Oh, Walter's distraction is timing out.<eos> Toby, check Doppler radar and tell me when the prevailing winds are hitting exactly northeast, 12.7 degrees.<eos> I'm not gonna remind you that if the guards see you with that thing, they'll shoot you on sight.
Twice.<eos> I had a lot of free time.<eos> 'Cause I wasn't around, huh?<eos> You got to put your back into that.<eos> Now, give me that.<eos> You okay?<eos> Barely.<eos> What the heck happened?<eos> Why do you still have the original panels?<eos> They should be over the Mediterranean by now.
'Cause I wasn't around, huh?<eos> You got to put your back into that.<eos> Now, give me that.<eos> You okay?<eos> Barely.<eos> What the heck happened?<eos> Why do you still have the original panels?<eos> They should be over the Mediterranean by now.<eos> I couldn't risk them ending up in enemy hands.<eos> They wouldn't have wound up in enemy hands.
Tell us what happens next.<eos> I have no idea. That's what makes it so good.<eos> Frank, a.K.A. Anatoly, Is the key to figuring out what's behind these murders,<eos> So you guys dig into his life and see what you can find.<eos> What do you want us to do about vasily?<eos> We got to keep him as far away from this case as possible, Which means we need to launch operation nickel tour.<eos> What's that?<eos> You're gonna take him sightseeing.<eos> See what he knows.<eos> In the meantime, I'm gonna talk to the feds And see if they have any intel On anatoly returning to active status.
Cookie, you are fooling yourself.<eos> This is not an audition, it is a trap.<eos> And Valencia is playing with you like a cat with a chipmunk.<eos> See, I thought about that, too, but even if it is a trap, I don't care.<eos> I'll just chipmunk my way... Out of that trap.<eos> Yeah, I don't care how I got invited.<eos> The point is, I got invited.<eos> And I have a chance to be in a real group of friends.<eos> Friends?<eos> Honey, they don't care about you.

Oh, yeah, and then we, like, hung out over the holidays.<eos> Yep. You hung out over the hol...<eos> Oh.<eos> That's great.<eos> Is this, like, a date?<eos> Are you, are you guys dating?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do people still use that word?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> They... yeah.
No, listen, I-I need this, okay?<eos> I need help.<eos> For him.<eos> Thank you for stopping.<eos> Oh, it's like Xanadu.<eos> What an Uber-doober-coinkydinky to run into you and your friendos, Rebecca!<eos> This day has been a nightmare.<eos> I mean, I just happened to decide to go to the beach but then I was so excited about hitting the rays and catching the sun that, well, I didn't happen to look at ye olde gas gauge.<eos> Anyway, I pull over to the side of the road, and then some people in a car drive by and yell, "Hey!<eos> Magnum P.I." Which I was actually excited about, but then they flicked a lit cigarette at me.
If the cure doesn't happen...<eos> - It's going to.<eos> - But if it doesn't...<eos> I don't want to come back as a zombie.<eos> A private military contractor buying out my little energy drink business.<eos> Your factories, labs, all of it.<eos> LIV:<eos> Drake's alive.<eos> I just saw your zombies.<eos> They're all alive!
It's insane to let him stay here.<eos> PEYTON:<eos> He showed up here afraid for his life.<eos> Mr. Boss sent hit men to Shady Plots.<eos> RAVI:<eos> You're making my case for me.<eos> PEYTON:<eos> Think about what it means if something happens to Blaine.<eos> We still don't know who his brain clients are.<eos> He dies, they don't get fed.
Ah, cocktails!<eos> Perfect timing.<eos> Cellblock Mango, or Convicted Melon?<eos> Which would you prefer, Viv?<eos> Vian.<eos> I only drink liquor that comes out of a barrel.<eos> The way God intended.<eos> Double-fisted it is, then.<eos> So tell me about all the cool stuff your mercenaries will be doing when you pump 'em full of Super Max.<eos> They gonna be dodging bullets

Hey, roomie.<eos> Well, if it isn't the poster child for poetic justice.<eos> Did someone have a lab accident?<eos> I'm gonna guess, based on that dismembered hand in your belt, that you weren't invited down here.<eos> Bet I know what you're looking for.<eos> Who you're looking for.<eos> Where are they?<eos> Hey, baby.<eos> I can access the control panel to get you to your zombies.<eos> They're right through that door.
Here.<eos> [ELEVATOR DOOR DINGING]<eos> - [GROWLING] - [GUNSHOTS]<eos> I'm so sorry about Drake.<eos> [EXHALING DEEPLY]<eos> I killed him.<eos> He was already gone, Liv.<eos> That wasn't him.<eos> Are there any other survivors?<eos> They're in Vaughn's office.
Previously on "The Vampire Diaries"...<eos> Who's thirsty?<eos> (whooping)<eos> Julian took over our town.<eos> I suppose it wasn't so much of a takeover as a walk right in, nobody stopping you.<eos> Alaric's babies are the future of the coven.<eos> They're inside of you.
Yeah, duh, that's why we called you.<eos> Can you just be witchy and fix it?<eos> May I?<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> - What did you just do?<eos> - I didn't do anything.<eos> - What's that supposed to mean?<eos> - I think these babies are siphons, like me.<eos> What?<eos> And I'm afraid they might be feeding off your blood.

Oh, my God.<eos> What?<eos> Wooden bullets.<eos> If you're gonna wear a uniform in Mystic Falls, you need wooden bullets.<eos> (monitor beeping rhythmically)<eos> What is it?<eos> It's a talisman spelled with magic.<eos> I'm hoping the babies will pull from it instead of you.<eos> And if they don't?<eos> They still have to bake in there a little bit longer.
Stefan, what a surprise.<eos> Can I buy you a drink?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I really admire what you did for your brother today.<eos> You know, it's a shame nothing will come of it.<eos> I'm afraid your brother's too far gone to be rehabilitated.<eos> Hmm, you're probably right.<eos> Of course, uh... that's all your fault for running that sword through him and sending him to hell.<eos> Do you really think it's wise... (Julian grunts) to brazenly attack me in front of all my friends?<eos> Here's the thing: they can't see you.
Callie, I've been working in the system for over 30 years.<eos> And let's be honest, Rita...<eos> You have your own agenda.<eos> And what agenda is that, Callie?<eos> - Taking care of kids?<eos> - No, keeping things the same<eos> - to protect your job.<eos> - Wow.<eos> That's what you think of me?<eos> I think change is hard for people, especially when they can't see the big picture.
- Why don't you guys sit down, join us?<eos> We've asked Ana to come and talk to you guys about your birth dad.<eos> - Jesus, I think this is something you're gonna wanna hear, so why don't you have a seat?<eos> So, your moms told me you found out Gabe was on the sex offender registry... which was news to me.<eos> The reason he's on that list, it's not because he was...<eos> He's on that list because of me.<eos> I... I was 15 when I met Gabe.<eos> He was 18.<eos> When my parents found out about us...<eos> Well, let's just say they didn't approve, because he was older and they found out he sold drugs.

You're not thinking big enough.<eos> You're gonna push out the old man.<eos> Aren't you?<eos> Hence the urgency.<eos> And you're gonna need someone to fill that position.<eos> I must commend you on your impeccable timing.<eos> Welcome, Delos board of directors.<eos> I want full creative control of this place...<eos> The parks, the narratives, the hosts.<eos> You'll be able to do with them whatever your tiny, little heart desires as long as they are simpler, more manageable.
Natalie's in labor?<eos> How's she doing?<eos> Fine, I suppose.<eos> Her water broke right in front of me, but that's not what I came to talk to you about.<eos> Dr. Manning and I just diagnosed Parker with a terminal genetic condition called Krabbe Disease, and now she's in labor, and I have to tell the parents that their eight-year-old child is going to die, and that the same thing might happen to their three-year-old.<eos> So I guess I was just wondering... how do...<eos> How do I do that?<eos> Have a seat.<eos> In my experience, it's best to be direct and get straight to the point.<eos> When people get bad news like this, they tend to get overwhelmed.

Since he has not yet presented symptoms, the hope is we can treat him with stem cells and stop him from developing the disease.<eos> The hope?<eos> Why don't we check the records first and... and go from there?<eos> Again, I'm so sorry.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Oz, turn the room over.<eos> Whoa. What happened to my patient?<eos> The Air Ambulance medics came to take Ms. Gonzalez away.<eos> What?<eos> They just left.
Because I think the cops would be a lot more vexed by you sneaking around, peering into people's windows.<eos> Don't you? That's a strong point.<eos> I'm gonna go home now.<eos> It's a good choice.<eos> Stop it.<eos> That's weird.<eos> No, no. It's good.<eos> It's, like, pleasant.<eos> We should all do it.<eos> - Oh. - What are they doing?
I love Josh.<eos> Say his full name.<eos> Paula, I'm not...<eos> I love...<eos> Joshua Felix Chan.<eos> "Mr. and Mrs. Bunch request the honor of your presence "at the wedding of their daughter<eos> Rebecca Nora Bunch and Joshua Felix Chan."<eos> Paula, we're not close to getting married, you know.<eos> It's not like I've been Googling pictures of mixed-race babies.<eos> They're so cute... they're so much cuter than the plain ones.
Hear me out.<eos> I did it at my old high school in Scarsdale.<eos> Huge success.<eos> All the girls ended up on the pill because of me.<eos> Listen, Rebecca, when we say, "get involved,"<eos> what we mean is, "give us money."<eos> Our lawyers wouldn't let us put, "just give us some damn money" on the posters.<eos> Well, great. Okay, so if I give you money, I can come to camp?<eos> No, no.<eos> Donors don't come to the camp, Ms. Bunch, no matter how much money they give.
- Mm-mm.<eos> - Put yourself first.<eos> You're totally right.<eos> Like, I should read Gloria Steinem and take a ceramics class and grow my pit hair out, you know?<eos> It's like, stuff like that...<eos> No. What you need is a makeover.<eos> ♪ Put yourself first, girl, worry about yourself ♪<eos> ♪ make yourself sexy just for yourself ♪<eos> ♪ so when dudes see you put yourself first ♪<eos> ♪ they'll be like, "damn you're hot... want to make out?" ♪

- I'm going with Herrmann.<eos> - Good.<eos> Be right behind you, Dawson.<eos> I'll call Cindy.<eos> Hey, Cruz.<eos> Where's your little friend, Freddie?<eos> Severide, don't.<eos> You gonna help the cops find him?<eos> I'm gonna tell 'em everything I know.<eos> They'll find him.
Now, he's going to need a lot of blood and plasma, so the risk of TRALI is high, but we will deal with that if it comes up.<eos> Thank you, Doctor.<eos> Well, we're gonna be out here sending all the good mojo we got his way.<eos> Take good care of him, Doctor.<eos> I will.<eos> Um, Herrmann's awake and he wanted to talk to you before he went into surgery.<eos> You all right, Chief?<eos> It's okay to be angry, Wallace.<eos> You've been through a lot lately, and now this.<eos> All my recent troubles, they pale by comparison.
Yeah.<eos> Hey.<eos> Whatever you're feeling right now,<eos> I want you to put that energy into this call.<eos> Nothing else exists.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> All right, guys, let's move.<eos> I don't see my parents anywhere.<eos> Okay, hold on.<eos> What if they're still in there?
I'll look at it when I can.<eos> Why on Earth would you think my client would bomb a morgue?<eos> Because he is the head of Sombra Roja, and because the bodies of five murdered Honduran gangsters were destroyed in that blast.<eos> Bodies that his men put there.<eos> We think autopsies would produce some evidence that your client didn't want revealed.<eos> Now, normally, he wouldn't care if any of his underlings went down.<eos> They never talk when they're captured, and it's easy enough to rotate new sicarios into the country.<eos> But the men that killed those Hondurans, they weren't just any underlings now, were they?<eos> We know Mr. Barranco's nephews, Justino and Angel, arrived in town last week.<eos> We also know that they have a few notches on their belts.
A little over a year ago, she embarrassed him on the court.<eos> I mean, just... humiliated.<eos> He went to his car.<eos> He came back with his gun, and he pistol whipped her.<eos> He didn't kill her, but he might as well have.<eos> She has irreversible brain damage.<eos> I ran his name yesterday. I didn't see anything about that in the system.<eos> Of course, you didn't.<eos> The kids that were there were too afraid to give Hector up.<eos> They knew if they did, they'd get the same from his crew.
He gets it.<eos> I think you get it, too.<eos> Otherwise, you wouldn't be with him.<eos> Think about it.<eos> It's all I'm asking.<eos> Still no word on Toby Dannon?<eos> Uniformed officers visited all three construction sites where he could have been working.<eos> He seems to have taken a powder.<eos> Think his parents tipped him off?<eos> Wouldn't surprise me if they were packing his bags for Rio as we speak.
Dr. McCord.<eos> What party?<eos> It's eggs and mimosas and solving some problems.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll send out an e-mail to the members.<eos> Great.<eos> How could they not like us?<eos> People like us.<eos> Do you remember our old neighborhood?<eos> They called us the Merry McCords.
This is important.<eos> I'll tell you what, if you get in trouble,<eos> - you just blame it on me, okay?<eos> - I'm sorry, ma'am.<eos> I'm not authorized to do that.<eos> Hey, have you called Conrad to tell him the trade agreement is finalized?<eos> Yeah, he was in a meeting, so I left a message at the office.<eos> Uh, he's probably home by now.<eos> It's this whole thing with the neighbors, Matt.<eos> They-they don't like the cars running all the time.
I didn't even tell him it was happening.<eos> That's how nervous I was he'd make a scene.<eos> He'd start quizzing the big shots at my table about how badly they treated their workers.<eos> It seems crazy now, but being embarrassed at that dinner felt like it would end my world.<eos> So, we were walking off-campus to grab dinner in town.<eos> I took a wrong turn.<eos> There we were at the hall.<eos> There was a big banner.<eos> All the guys were going in with their dads.<eos> And they looked like... what they were.
In a way, that's right.<eos> Dear Lord.<eos> We'll call if we need anything.<eos> El Paso Gazette.<eos> Young family in Indiana take their children to an amusement park.<eos> Three kids.<eos> They'd been there for about an hour, playing, having fun. Parents turned around, one of the kids is gone.<eos> The little one.<eos> The parents is frantic.<eos> So they leave the two older kids with this fella selling' pretzels.

I have no idea.<eos> All right, that bit, that's confusing.<eos> But the point is, things got testy, right? Then things got rough.<eos> Now I'm a big believer in live and let live, but when someone comes at one of my friends brandishing a bloody chainsaw, we're gonna have issues.<eos> Right.<eos> Where are my keys?<eos> I thought they were here for me. Right? I thought this is my problem,<eos> I'm gonna deal with it on me own, and I did. A dozen pieces buried in a suitcase and that's it. - Problem solved, right?<eos> - Good.<eos> Good, except they come back.

The ones I was telling you. They're following me halfway across the country!
What are you gonna do, man?<eos> - About what?<eos> - About Genesis.<eos> Honestly, I mean, what a terrible name. It's just awful.<eos> I'm keeping it, like I said.<eos> I dunno, Padre.<eos> Now, those fellers might not seem the sharpest shivs in Heaven's shed, but still, I mean, you said they were bloody angels.<eos> Yeah, and?<eos> And I don't know how it works, but don't...<eos> I don't know... don't they outrank you?
Why haven't I?<eos> We don't know.<eos> You see, this is my point.<eos> What else don't we know?<eos> We don't know.<eos> This doesn't make sense.<eos> I mean, how did this happen? D-Don't you have questions?<eos> No! Lie... down.<eos> No one understands God's plans at first.<eos> I mean, look at the prophets. In the beginning, they're always in the dark.
Sorry.<eos> Sorry, big fella.<eos> So sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Cass.<eos> You okay?<eos> Jesse said the cops got you.<eos> Yeah, no, I'm fine.<eos> They just let me off with a warning and a couple of bullet holes.
What's with all the trucks in the street?<eos> Did the Rutledges rent out their house for another commercial shoot?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Apparently, it's a big one...<eos> Tampax.<eos> Right here in our own neighborhood?<eos> Gross.<eos> Well, Barb called and said the port-a-potties will be gone in a couple of days.<eos> I love those things.<eos> They take hand-washing out of the equation.
I got her this cruller as a thank-you for the delicious pizzas she treated us to.<eos> Yeah, she's a gem.<eos> Okay, that cruller is mine.<eos> I'm the gem.<eos> I sparkle and shine.<eos> Well, I guess all's well that ends well, then.<eos> I thought Damona was my friend.<eos> Oh, good. More.<eos> I just don't understand why she'd want to make me look stupid in front of everyone.<eos> Well, you know how when people are good friends, they'll often participate in some light to moderate joshing?
I just thought that you might need the extra sugar kick before...<eos> You know, coming back to work.<eos> I'm not going back to the DEO, Alex.<eos> I can't.<eos> Kara, Hank was only doing his duty.<eos> Okay?<eos> Protecting the planet.<eos> Just like you do, every day.<eos> I don't kill.<eos> But soldiers do, when they have to.
There is no room for doubt.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> - Nobody has killed anyone.<eos> Six months ago, they killed my husband in Peru when he said he was done.<eos> I have spent the last three months scraping together<eos> $400 to escape San Diego.<eos> I bought a crap car. Managed to get it across the country.<eos> I just wanted to go home.<eos> I wanted to see my grandparents.<eos> I haven't seen them in 16 years, but when I got there they were waiting for me.
Yeah, that too.<eos> The pot.<eos> The medicine, the flyers.<eos> The media blackout.<eos> That was the '70s. This is a new time.<eos> People need us.<eos> Look! Look at all the need out there, and we can reach them.<eos> But those who need The Ladder find The Ladder.<eos> Not with us on the street corners like Jews for Jesus.<eos> We have to be realistic. If the people could hear what we're about, they would flock to us.
Well, that is unacceptable.<eos> Who will man the phones?<eos> I guess I will.<eos> You know, just as soon as I get back from this thing I have to do.<eos> Cat Grant's office.<eos> That four-eyed bitch in a kilt ruined my life.<eos> Look, what's, uh, what's really going on?<eos> No one will hire me.<eos> I've sent my resume out to every media outlet in town.<eos> And when I call to follow up, they're polite on the phone until they hear my name and then, dial tone.
She's not from here either.<eos> That one, Alex.<eos> She's tough.<eos> They both are, in their own way.<eos> I too had daughters.<eos> When I link back up with my team, I'm gonna explain to them who you are, and what you did for me.<eos> I'm not a threat.<eos> I know that.<eos> But humans can be ignorant.<eos> Especially when they're scared.
I didn't want it to be true.<eos> I'm sorry you had to find out this way.<eos> But you're the only person that can stop Hank and Alex from being sent to Project Cadmus.<eos> Why would I help you?<eos> You and Hank...<eos> Why do you all lie?<eos> When you're an alien, and you've lost your world and you're dropped into a new one, you don't have a choice.<eos> Who's the new girl?<eos> Foster kid. Alex Danvers' parents took her in.<eos> I'd hate my parents if they did that to me.
Human lives.<eos> So, you're gonna dissect him.<eos> I'm protecting the world.<eos> You're pathetic.<eos> And you're a traitor.<eos> So get comfortable, Agent Danvers, because you belong to Cadmus now.<eos> Sir, behind us.<eos> Sir, we've got two bogies.<eos> Take 'em out.<eos> They're wearing body armor.
I saw that, uh, winning the people back wasn't going so well.<eos> I have tried everything I can think of.<eos> Last night I helped a family assemble their IKEA table.<eos> It's still not enough.<eos> One mistake.<eos> That's all it took to just erase all the good I did before.<eos> You were poisoned.<eos> It's, it's not your fault.<eos> People don't know that.<eos> All they know is that this symbol doesn't mean what it used to anymore.
I'm flattered you think I'm behind it, but I've got bigger brains to fry.<eos> Like Cat Grant's and Supergirl's.<eos> And when I get out of here, you're all gonna pay.<eos> (ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)<eos> Aren't they exquisite?<eos> Yes, they look very yummy.<eos> I can see it in your eyes, Ker-rah, that you want one.<eos> But you're too scared.<eos> So instead, you gaze longingly from a safe distance, wishing that you had one all of your own.<eos> Well, let me tell you, cupcakes like these, they don't last.

Please don't do this.<eos> Begging?<eos> I'm disappointed.<eos> What are you so afraid you're gonna miss, hmm?<eos> Another silly award ceremony?<eos> Where a bunch of sycophants kowtow to the false queen and tell you how great you are?<eos> No.<eos> No. I'm not asking for myself.<eos> I'm asking for my boys.<eos> I'm all they have.
Technology designed to force everyone to her way of thinking.<eos> Mind Control.<eos> When they were caught attempting to use the Myriad technology against the people of Argo City,<eos> Astra and Non were arrested.<eos> And sentenced to Fort Rozz.<eos> Much like Krypton, this planet is on the verge of ecological destruction.<eos> I can stop it.<eos> But the humans won't like my methods.<eos> That's why I need you.<eos> They trust you.

She's safe.<eos> She's enthralled to Non's master weapon, isn't she?<eos> (SIGHS) Yes.<eos> Listen, you need to keep everybody outside of city limits until I can figure this out, okay?<eos> I know you and I haven't always had the best work relationship, but...<eos> I'll do my part.<eos> I trust you'll do yours.<eos> Good luck.<eos> (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)<eos> Ker-rah, call Harrison Ford and tell him that I'm flattered, but once and for all, I do not date older men, especially when they're married.
(CLICKS TONGUE) Why didn't I think of that?<eos> Thanks to Myriad, there are no more racial divisions, no Republicans, no Democrats.<eos> Only one people, working with one purpose towards one goal.<eos> To save the world.<eos> Except you haven't saved them, you've enslaved them.<eos> Humanity is better than this.<eos> If you really want this planet to avoid the fate of Krypton, then work with us.<eos> NON:<eos> With these people?<eos> These two are the best of your world and all they do is help the populace amuse themselves to death.

That's what corporate shrinks on retainer are for.<eos> Me, I'm more worried about what's still happening.<eos> Still happening?<eos> Everyone's been protected.<eos> No one's mind is being controlled.<eos> But I went to see how much damage the Kryptonians had done to my LTE network and I found out that since we ended their mind control, the Myriad wave has been amplified ten-fold and is rising exponentially.<eos> Amplified?<eos> To what end?<eos> Emergency rooms all over the city have been filled with people complaining about headaches.<eos> They're from Myriad, which, by my calculations, will continue to amplify until pop goes the cranium.
I've spoken with the president.<eos> She's indebted to you, Supergirl.<eos> As am I.<eos> She's also aware of the remarkable courage you demonstrated, J'onn J'onzz.<eos> She's granting you a full pardon and reinstating you as director of the DEO.<eos> In my absence, Major Lane has performed her duty as director with expertise and integrity.<eos> And if there's one thing I've learned in my lifetimes, it's that leaders are stronger working together.<eos> From now on, we're all on the same team, no more secrets.<eos> Secrets protect no one.<eos> They only undermine what we're striving to accomplish,
The Empire's making our travels around the Outer Rim tougher all the time.<eos> Yes.<eos> We need a new hyperspace route in and out of the Lothal sector.<eos> I may have a perfect shortcut.<eos> The system of Concord Dawn.<eos> It's a Mandalorian colony and not an Imperial territory yet.<eos> Why not?<eos> They've grabbed up just about every other place.<eos> Concord Dawn is known for its elite warriors.<eos> They were brought in to train clones back in the war.
Chopper, load up the intel Sabine gathered.<eos> We can pinpoint where their base is.<eos> What do you mean, "Just ask her"?<eos> He means I'm standing right behind you.<eos> - Better jam those scanners.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> You must be pretty distracted not to have noticed I stowed away.<eos> So, what are you really up to?<eos> You heard Sato's orders.<eos> I'm gonna destroy those fighters before they take off.
Here, where I can hide if I need to.<eos> This estate you've rented.<eos> Is it befitting a family of our good name?<eos> It belonged to a wealthy earl.<eos> You'll be quite comfortable.<eos> Why don't you sample some of Greer's ale, Thomas?<eos> Sorry about Thomas.<eos> After we lost the money for our dowries that your husband had promised,<eos> Father was happy to marry us off to anyone with titles.<eos> Titled men have such ridiculous pride, even when they haven't got a penny to their names.
I'm gonna take the rest of this trash out.<eos> You need me to dump anything else?<eos> Nah, I'm good.<eos> I'm gonna head upstairs.<eos> Tim, are you okay?<eos> Hey, quit screwing around!<eos> Hey. Hey, what happened?<eos> Brandon Smit, 22, a senior at Hallridge University, and his brother, Timothy, 18, a freshman at Burlington Crest College.<eos> Both boys hail from Roswell, Georgia.<eos> They were on a break visiting Johannesburg, South Africa, where they'd taken temporary jobs in a bar working for their aunt, Mariam Nell, who reported them missing 24 hours ago.
What's changed for them?<eos> You know what I find most fascinating about American criminal procedure?<eos> Is the obsessive fixation with applying logical motivations to inherently aberrant and impassioned behaviors.<eos> You would prefer that we apply a more emotional logic to our analysis?<eos> At some point, we must draw ourselves into the hearts and minds of these unknown subjects.<eos> I disagree.<eos> That approach is self-indulgent and reckless.<eos> And why I would prefer the guidance of the dead.<eos> Gang or no gang, these murders aren't just about fear.<eos> They're about recognition.
Not bad.<eos> All right. I guess all we have to do now is, uh...<eos> Wait.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You okay?<eos> I'm nervous.<eos> If this really is the Banshee I've been looking for...<eos> Eileen, in my experience... Revenge is not all it's cracked up to be.<eos> Killing this Banshee is not gonna bring your parents back.<eos> I never met them. They're just pictures to me.

Revenge is not all it's cracked up to be.<eos> Killing this Banshee is not gonna bring your parents back.<eos> I never met them. They're just pictures to me.<eos> But...<eos> They're family.
Look, all I care about is Kawama.<eos> Is he done?<eos> Yeah, he's done, but you got to take better care of him, man.<eos> It looks like you gave him a camionazo.<eos> Mira.<eos> You're lucky Que no Te sacaron un ojo.<eos> Come on, man, English.<eos> I feel sorry for you, man.<eos> I can't believe your parents never taught you Spanish.<eos> That's because they really didn't speak Spanish either.
No pressure.<eos> I'm sick of people thinking I'm a loser.<eos> You think winning is the answer?<eos> I started fighting 'cause I want to be like those guys.<eos> El Liberador,<eos> Tornado Tejano, the guys I grew up watching when I was a kid.<eos> [scoffs]<eos> I wish I could wear something cool like that.<eos> Well, that type of mask is very expensive.<eos> But they never lost.
Do you remember anything?<eos> I didn't mean to.<eos> It was the mask.<eos> I tried to take it off, but it wouldn't come off.<eos> He's not the only one you killed.<eos> What?<eos> Mayordomo.<eos> No, please, you have to believe me.<eos> The masks told me to do it.<eos> They're trying to protect me.
He's not the only one you killed.<eos> What?<eos> Mayordomo.<eos> No, please, you have to believe me.<eos> The masks told me to do it.<eos> They're trying to protect me.<eos> - Don't let him do it.<eos> - The voices...<eos> The v... the voices. [speaking Spanish]<eos> They're protecting me, the voices.
I love that guy.<eos> [Gasps] Me, too.<eos> Ooh, he's so handsome.<eos> Whoa, whoa, put it back in your mom jeans, all right?<eos> I should go say hello.<eos> Say hello?<eos> You don't know him.<eos> Eh, we're both doctors.<eos> It's like how Prius owners always honk at each other.<eos> Mom, those college kids are playing cards, and they invited me to play.
Anybody got a cookie?<eos> "Anybody got a cookie?"<eos> Yeah, well, at least Bonnie gets it.<eos> Bonnie totally gets it, Fred.<eos> Why don't we change the subject?<eos> All right, anything you want, sweetheart.<eos> Do you want a cookie, 'cause there's a whole tray over...<eos> You know what I like best about country club life?<eos> Signing for things.<eos> Those people are so rich they don't use money anymore.
You know what could happen if a depressed man pilots a plane?<eos> How about a suicidal surgeon?<eos> Would you go under her knife?<eos> - So you're their therapist?<eos> - I tried to counsel them.<eos> I even sent the first one, that bus driver, to a doctor who could prescribe medication.<eos> Dr. Kukra.<eos> Well, he won't have much to say anymore.<eos> Don't trust pills anyway.<eos> No guarantee that they'll work.
Chuck it!<eos> What?<eos> Scott, throw it through the window.<eos> I can't throw it...<eos> Scott, the boat is sinking.<eos> Throw the rock through the widow!<eos> I can't believe we did that.<eos> Uh, what else can we break?<eos> Oh, I still got to pee!<eos> So, I just want to let you know I was thinking about it in the car and what if the bad guys felt really bad about what they'd done and-and they and they went and cleaned it up, 'cause I've heard about that happening.
You're not the master of where I go.<eos> This piece of paper means nothing to me as I have an investor now.<eos> Gentlemen, so sorry to keep you.<eos> Sorry.<eos> John.<eos> Wait... please...<eos> My, my, a restaurant at the end of our street.<eos> Will erm...<eos> Will folk be expected to dress for dinner, if they come to call?<eos> Folk can wear what they want, as long as their money's good.
Your food, Mr Blackwood.<eos> I trust you slept well.<eos> I need to see my brother.<eos> I need to talk to him.<eos> No, it's best you stay right here for now.<eos> Red has friends on the gang and there've been rumblings.<eos> I've sent for the magistrate, but until then, you're safer under lock and key.<eos> And whatever's happened between us, sir, I'll see that you're dealt with fairly.<eos> The workers are not happy, sir.<eos> They want answers.
I heard how you spent it.<eos> It was a pretty girl, huh?<eos> Don't let anything happen to him.<eos> I need to go to the Blackwood house, Mr Blackwood needs to know what's happening.<eos> I'm begging you, don't let them touch him.<eos> Come on!<eos> You have to come, Mr Blackwood!<eos> It's John, he's in bad trouble.<eos> The shanty folk are taking justice into their own hands.<eos> - At least, they're about to.
Make sure you make this one stick, won't you?<eos> What are you doing in here?<eos> It's supposed to be a private ceremony.<eos> Where's Davey?<eos> There's been an accident at the mine.<eos> Dagger, are you all right?<eos> Annie, don't get too close!<eos> Johnny, can you hear me?<eos> Those Blackwood boys - they're just children.<eos> They don't know the first thing about the work they're doing.
This is the best chance they have of not suffocating.<eos> Get those people behind the crow line.<eos> Move back.<eos> Come on.<eos> Tell me you're trying to save them and not just bury them all.<eos> What do you think I am, Mrs Quaintain?<eos> Move back!<eos> Johnny ordered you off this land.<eos> Everyone knows it.<eos> There are only two men who are your masters here, Mr Coates, and they're both in that mine tunnel.
We've been given a house there.<eos> Wallis likes to entertain. She's so good at it.<eos> So the place is always full.<eos> And we have dogs.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> What kind?<eos> Pugs.<eos> Davy Crockett, Trooper and Disraeli.<eos> - Why pugs? What's the attraction?<eos> - Well, they're... childlike.

And they're lazy.<eos> Spend all day sleeping.<eos> - Yes. - They're awfully gassy.<eos> Yes. I suppose one can always open the windows.<eos> - Don't you miss it?<eos> - What?<eos> The country of your birth.<eos> The people here.<eos> Your own flesh and blood.<eos> Well, I would've done if they'd accepted the woman I love.
- Don't you miss it?<eos> - What?<eos> The country of your birth.<eos> The people here.<eos> Your own flesh and blood.<eos> Well, I would've done if they'd accepted the woman I love.<eos> But they didn't, so I don't.<eos> So the former King keeps himself at a distance.<eos> A distance that was imposed upon me.<eos> They wanted me out.
As a wife, a mother.<eos> An ordinary English countrywoman.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You might extend the same apology to my husband the next time you see him.<eos> - Oh, is he struggling?<eos> - A little.<eos> Well, it'd be odd if he weren't.<eos> Anyway, if I am to succeed, then he and I are going to need all the help we can get.<eos> Well, I'm sure you're surrounded by good people offering it.<eos> Not if they're always off in Paris or New York, or wherever it is you spend your time.
My grandfather was.<eos> I'm just trying to protect you.<eos> From whom?<eos> The British people?<eos> You have no idea who they are or what they want.<eos> Oh, oh, I'm just Johnny Foreigner, again, who doesn't understand.<eos> Fine, fine.<eos> You want a big overblown ceremony costing a fortune while the rest of the country is on rations, have it.<eos> But don't come bleating to me when your head and the heads of our children are on spikes.<eos> If the people are hungry, they want something that lifts them up.

No, not at all.<eos> It's wonderful.<eos> - Is there anything you'd like to ask us?<eos> - Does your wife know?<eos> - No, ex-wife.<eos> - She does. We had a frank conversation.<eos> - There is no animosity.<eos> - Oh, good.<eos> - And the boys?<eos> - They know and seem very happy.
You just need to take the key.<eos> Hurry.<eos> This door won't last much longer.<eos> And you're gonna have to pick up a gun then.<eos> You're all going to die here, John.<eos> Hurry, Thelonious.<eos> The migration is not yet complete.<eos> We're still searching for the tunnel entrance.<eos> When the guards break down the door, I'll be there.<eos> John Murphy was with Claire Griffin when they removed the second A.I.
It was Tim Harrison's wallet.<eos> What?<eos> We call that burying the lead.<eos> And I call it...<eos> I still can't believe it.<eos> Were both shooting victims black?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And the shooter was white, and a cop.<eos> Did the witnesses identify Tim as the shooter?<eos> They all picked his photo from the array.

Octavio Nunez is back in town.<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> Of course I know that!<eos> Him and his brothers just bought two buildings on the street.<eos> And probably half the people that are living there are the same people who saw what he did to Gabo that night.<eos> Yeah, and they kept their mouths shut.<eos> Which is why they're still alive.<eos> You know that other building just happened to explode when the owner wouldn't sell low to Octavio?<eos> Why you got to be such a drama queen?<eos> Mami, I need you to talk to those neighbors and get them to open up about what they saw that night.
The LA County Courthouse gift shop is straight up bull.<eos> Can you believe I had to have these shirts made?<eos> Yeah, I can believe that.<eos> Where's Reagan?<eos> Probably putting on her shirt still.<eos> Yeah, Reagan's not exactly the matching T type.<eos> I-I feel like the moment has passed, don't you?<eos> - Yeah, I feel like it's so passed. - Mm-hmm. Yeah.<eos> That's the thing about moments, though.<eos> They come and they go.

And we had such interesting conversations.<eos> Honestly, after talking to them, I felt like anything is possible.<eos> Oh, you guys did molly?<eos> Now I'm jealous.<eos> These people don't need drugs to be happy.<eos> Oh, so it's a cult.<eos> How did you get cult from that?<eos> You think the only way I can make friends is by joining a cult?<eos> You could also always have gum.<eos> In fact, they're so nice, they invited you to come for the weekend.
- Thank you, Mr. Spock.<eos> We agreed, I'm Kirk, you're Spock.<eos> I never agreed to that.<eos> - Boys.<eos> - Right, sorry.<eos> Hobbit feet?<eos> I went outside to check on a noise and I forgot to wipe the dirt off my feet.<eos> Oh, thank God. I thought you meant hobbit feet as in hairy.<eos> Yeah, you've seen my feet.<eos> - Did they suddenly sprout?
Oh, it is so nice to hear those words come out of a man's mouth.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> Ever since Kyle got that promotion, he barely acknowledges me.<eos> Come on, now, I'm sure he knows how lucky he is.<eos> You have the twins, a spotless house,<eos> Killer yoga arms.<eos> Aw.<eos> Unh-unh.<eos> This happens all the time --<eos> They get on their track to success, and you become the invisible housewife.
And Elizabeth Vargas had to almost sacrifice a squirrel?<eos> I went through the bag they dumped in the trash.<eos> Oh, hi...<eos> Now you're involving our daughter?<eos> I don't know what she's talking about.<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> You need to get out of the house.<eos> Go get the stamps.<eos> And a hobby.<eos> Okay, well, they're in our home,
Where are you going?<eos> Oh!<eos> [ gasps ] [ ringtone plays ]<eos> Hey.<eos> Um, what's up?<eos> I'm still getting stamps.<eos> Look to your left.<eos> [ gasps ] What are you doing?<eos> I'm hiding.<eos> They're here.
Sure it is, Bones.<eos> Look, I've seen my share of this kind of thing.<eos> You're referring to your experience with soldiers wounded in war?<eos> Look, the emotional recovery can be as tough as the physical one, but there's nothing more important than hope.<eos> A city worker found a body off the expressway.<eos> They're bringing it to the lab now.<eos> All right, I'll drop you there.<eos> The predation to the body is extensive.<eos> Likely rats, based on the teeth marks to the cortical surfaces.<eos> Well, they certainly went to town on the victim's clothing and organs.
I feel fine.<eos> You know, I should have refused to do this.<eos> But you didn't because you love solving cases and you love me so much.<eos> And because we all agreed to the rules:<eos> once those bones are recovered, you go home.<eos> So, Bertha's rainfall raised the water line of interest by approximately four inches, just enough to lift and carry the loose bones and fragments.<eos> How far are we talking?<eos> Well, the water was at peak overfill for 12 hours.<eos> Moving the bones a distance of 84 feet.<eos> And they stopped here where the flood water reached its topographical base point.
Thank you, Hodgins.<eos> I'll send someone out to retrieve them.<eos> Great.<eos> Bones located.<eos> Husband home to rest.<eos> Uh, I need to be there.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Are you trying to give me a heart attack?<eos> I know what to look for.<eos> I mean, they may have been ground into sediment or...
You should definitely stay.<eos> But how about I find us a beautiful hotel so when you're done with that, we can start this?<eos> - Oh, I love that idea.<eos> - You know what I love?<eos> - Making out with me?<eos> - It's like we share a brain.<eos> Okay, there you go.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> Wow, people are loving our mushroom popovers.<eos> Yeah, till they wait an hour and don't feel anything.
I don't know why I'm doing an accent.<eos> Look, you're not the only person to have difficulties in this area.<eos> Maybe you don't have one special person, but you have many people.<eos> Plural people?<eos> Hello?<eos> They're here because they love you.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Oh, they all look so worried.
I like how all the circles are different.<eos> Was your sandwich for lunch OK?<eos> Yeah, it was a really great sandwich.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> Did you get a little writing done?<eos> I did, yeah.<eos> You know, darling,<eos> I really think you should do something about those beautiful poems.<eos> They should belong to the world, you know?
You smell faintly of... of beer.<eos> How do you say his name again?<eos> It's like Gae-tan... - It's Gaetano Bresci.<eos> - That sounds interesting.<eos> Yeah, he, um, he co-founded this anarchist newspaper here in Paterson, but it was in Italian, um, called La Questione Sociale.<eos> - La Questione Sociale.<eos> - Yeah. He was born in Italy, but he lived here.<eos> He was a weaver, an anarchist weaver.<eos> This was in the 1890s. And at that time in Italy, people were starving.<eos> When they demonstrated, this Italian general had them fired upon with, like, muskets and cannons, which, of course, resulted in a bloody massacre with, like, a hundred people dead.
I'm already on thin ice with her.<eos> Apparently a tenant called and complained about me.<eos> Complained about what?<eos> That I was making too much noise.<eos> It was probably Theo too.<eos> Look, I just need to keep everything on the D.L.<eos> and I need to replace all of the appliances on my own.<eos> I just don't have the money.<eos> Well, why don't you just stay with your parents?<eos> Are you kidding? If they ever found out about this, I would never hear the end of it.
Now he's an ex-boyfriend?<eos> Still talking.<eos> So Dirk said there was a company working on technology to clean oil spills using hydrocarbon-eating nanobots.<eos> You guys, I bet Jamie was developing that technology for MeriCorp Energy, only he accidentally his nanobots to consume carbon instead of hydrocarbon.<eos> Carbon, as in living tissue, as in...<eos> - People.<eos> - It's worse than that.<eos> Guys, we all know that people are not the only carbon-based life forms on the planet.<eos> Plants, animals, insects, everything up and down the food chain.<eos> And if those nanobots are self-replicating, they won't stop making more of themselves until they run out of food.
Oh, my God... you are so naive.<eos> I knew you weren't gonna cooperate.<eos> See, what you're feeling right now are my nanobots building stronger connections between the synapses in your brains.<eos> Unfortunately for you, your synapses don't need stronger connections, so your brains are short-circuiting.<eos> But don't worry, the bots are programmed to stop after a few hours.<eos> You have nanobots?<eos> Sure.<eos> Doesn't everybody?<eos> We infected the USB drive with our nanobots.<eos> When they both handled it, the nanobots entered their bodies through their skin.

I...<eos> - Your shirt!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Is that blood?<eos> Are you injured?<eos> It looks worse than it is, I swear.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - My car had a flat tire.<eos> It went off the road, but I'm fine.<eos> These two police detectives, they gave me a ride.
Millburn Survivors Camp.<eos> Just north of us, about a week ago.<eos> The same camp... three hours ago.<eos> The child you see here was a grown man an hour before the storm hit.<eos> - What happened to them?<eos> - Time driven insane.<eos> The anomalies tore through the camp, aging the survivors hundreds of years one moment and reversing it the next.<eos> Chaos.<eos> Temporal storms are resurging here... here, and here.<eos> They're closing in, destroying everything in their path.
You know how this ends, don't you?<eos> A wise man once told me, "There are many endings,<eos> "but the right one is the one you choose."<eos> - One more thing.<eos> - Titan.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know about it?<eos> I know that the search for Titan only leads to death.<eos> Your friends... their rage is blinding.<eos> You need to see what they can't.
- We need M5-10.<eos> - Peters.<eos> AKA the guy who created the virus that kills us all.<eos> - We've been looking for him.<eos> - Cassie told him to get out of Dodge.<eos> He's long gone by now.<eos> Or is he?<eos> Peters was adopted.<eos> My father helped track down his birth parents.<eos> They were dead, but there was a brother.
You could always join the rest of your men.<eos> How many was it went AWOL this week?<eos> I'd ask what's keeping you here, but we both know, don't we?<eos> Does she?<eos> Let's hurry this up.<eos> Easy! Easy!<eos> It's just a kid.<eos> You came from the camp near here?<eos> They're all gone.<eos> Your parents, they get caught in it?
You... are... Kirschner.<eos> You're not CIA.<eos> We put in a call.<eos> They never heard of you.<eos> So now what we will find out is, who do you work for, and how did you find the doctor?<eos> There are two types of trial.<eos> Ones that take place in a court of law...<eos> And ones that take place... In rooms like this.<eos> My contact says your friends stumbled onto a Mossad surveillance op in East Berlin.<eos> They've been detained.
I was worried you'd all be gone.<eos> Mother won't leave. There's something wrong with her.<eos> She's been saying a lot of strange things lately.<eos> Sounds like regular Jennifer to me. No, she won't listen to us.<eos> You have to convince her to go.<eos> I need your help. Mayday, mayday!<eos> Terrorists have taken over the Nakatomi Building, Century City!<eos> I don't know what that means.<eos> It means, McClane, that I know why you're here.<eos> They've got your Machine, and you want me and my Daughters to be the cavalry.
The paradox already happened in 1957. We failed.<eos> The final strike in your strikeout.<eos> You need to back it up and swing again.<eos> You don't get it.<eos> I can't travel through time anymore. I don't have a machine.<eos> James Cole does not need a machine.<eos> Go down the rabbit hole.<eos> Drink me.<eos> I've seen what this does to people.<eos> Their minds are untethered, they're...
If we're gonna have any chance of saving them, we need the Daughters to come with us.<eos> They won't listen to me. They don't believe in me.<eos> Then make them.<eos> Daughters of Earth, I am Jennifer Goines.<eos> What is this?<eos> As we speak, an army of death awaits our friends in Titan.<eos> But we... we can face that death head-on and save them!<eos> I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me.<eos> A day may come when the courage of women fails, and we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day!<eos> This is our chance, our one chance to tell our enemies that they can take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!
Not anymore.<eos> What?<eos> I kind of ripped up the check.<eos> I... Okay. I must have, like, premium vodka in my ears because I swear that you just said that you ripped up the check.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Yeah, 'cause I'm not a prostitute, so...<eos> Oh. Okay. So, then, what are you?<eos> Well, uh, I guess, at this point,<eos> I'm just... their booty call?<eos> I don't know. Hey, those assholes, they led you on.

- Okay. Okay, so you had sex with the guy that you met like three days ago, but instead of playing it cool and skedaddling, you hang around his apartment and ask him to spend the day with you?<eos> - Is... does that sound right?<eos> - Ohhh. You asked a married couple to go on a very public daylight date with you.<eos> I just...<eos> I don't see how that could make anybody anxious.<eos> Ohh. I scared the shit out of them, didn't I?<eos> Yeah. You did.<eos> The knee-jerk inclination is to make any new structure blend in with the overall Hamilton Prep School aesthetic, but this is a different beast.<eos> Here are a few examples of recently completed high-school theaters across the country.<eos> They're bold, splashy, standing out by design apologizing to no one.
Unless you're a woman.<eos> Plus, Bob's got a lot of connections.<eos> He could really help you with your deal.<eos> I'm not gonna sleep with God's college roommate to get ahead in Hollywood.<eos> I think sleeping's pretty much all you'd have to do.<eos> You're still driving?<eos> What are you dolls doing in Hollywood?<eos> Kind of.<eos> They're making a movie about us, So, what did the writers say?<eos> What did they think about Zach Galifianakis playing me?
What are you dolls doing in Hollywood?<eos> Kind of.<eos> They're making a movie about us, So, what did the writers say?<eos> What did they think about Zach Galifianakis playing me?<eos> Well, it's nothing personal, but the writers don't feel like you're...<eos> It's just, there's so much story.<eos> There's a lot of characters already.<eos> Max, I'm sorry.<eos> I told them you are crucial.<eos> But then they said maybe Jennifer Lawrence would play me and I kind of blacked out after that.
I have to give you a brief history on classic game theory.<eos> This shouldn't take too long.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Good.<eos> Keep your arms still and slowly rotate.<eos> There's no chance this could set off the bomb, right?<eos> Define "chance." There's good news and there's bad news.<eos> Good news first.<eos> So, uh, there's an interesting anomaly in the wiring-- an unorthodox, essentially superfluous twist in the conduits.<eos> These criminals, they often have distinct signatures in their work, not unlike the markings of a sculptor or repeating themes of a writer.
Get in the game.<eos> Ace!<eos> Ace!<eos> I wasn't even set.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You got to be on your toes, man.<eos> You got to be on your toes. That's game.<eos> You owe me a Lamborghini.<eos> You a cookie, guy? I got some great cookies back in the boat.<eos> I mean they're, you know, they're three years old, but they're still good.

You know, they're stale, but on purpose.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Uh. Your grocery delivery-- it's on its way.<eos> It'll be there in five minutes.<eos> I'm supposed to tell you I forgive you.<eos> Do you?<eos> That's what they want me to say.<eos> Why do you think your parents would want that?<eos> Apparently, they like you.

I'm finding this all...<eos> confusing.<eos> How so?<eos> I feel like there's this whole grown-up conspiracy.<eos> You're all so sure about what I'm supposed to feel and what I'm supposed to do, but then you just...<eos> do whatever you want.<eos> Well, that must feel awful.<eos> It does.<eos> Do you feel any clearer about your parents than when you first came to me?<eos> I know they believe in something.

- It's not.<eos> It's also very possible that they are surveilling all the other people right now.<eos> She may not be blown.<eos> What if you're wrong?<eos> We will do everything we can to protect her.<eos> These surveillance reports are very important to us.<eos> Can you give her a camera?<eos> I'm not sending her in there with a camera.<eos> What about memorizing dates?<eos> All we need are the dates that they're on William.
But this isn't about education or intelligence. This is about integrity and principle.<eos> Ma'am, you say you don't have what it takes to do battle with these people.<eos> You do.<eos> You were drilled for years in the finer points of our Constitution.<eos> You know it better than me, better than all of us.<eos> You have the only education that matters.<eos> So what would you have me do?<eos> Summon them and give them a good dressing down like children.<eos> Why would they stand for that?<eos> Because they're English, male and upper class.

And I would suggest that for some time now, you have been taking and harming.<eos> And therefore I come to you, in the name of the party and of the country, for the very last time, Winston, - to bid you to stand down.<eos> - I will in good time.<eos> The right time.<eos> The right time was nine years ago when you lost us the election.<eos> And I have since avenged that defeat by winning us the last election.<eos> I won us that, Winston! I won that!<eos> People voted Conservative in the clear expectation - that you would give way to me.<eos> - That is such rubbish!<eos> They voted Conservative because they couldn't stomach socialism!
A hot thoroughbred with a winning streak herself.<eos> She's a little on the young side, perhaps.<eos> Just three.<eos> We don't mind that, do we?<eos> - Immediate engagement.<eos> - Yes. I must say, I do like this one.<eos> It would appear the feeling is mutual.<eos> You're lovely.<eos> Telegrams have been pouring into Downing Street today to wish Sir Winston Churchill, a happy 80th birthday on this the 30th of November.<eos> They come from all...
Just do what you have to do.<eos> But promise me you've got the best doctors in Virginia.<eos> Just hurry back.<eos> Scalpel?<eos> Here you are, doctor?<eos> What's happening?<eos> Doctor, are you all right?<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> No, don't touch that.<eos> I think the babies want to stay where they can keep feeding off Caroline as a source of magic.
- She's right.<eos> You have to let them go.<eos> They can take Beau and draw Rayna away from us.<eos> The doctors are nearly finished.<eos> I'll do what I can on my own.<eos> You can't stay here.<eos> Come with us.<eos> These babies deserve a chance.<eos> I can give that to them.<eos> They could drain you, val.
He's in the car.<eos> He found Matthew's Cocoa Puffs, so he's eaten already.<eos> I'm- - I'm gonna give him a lift to school.<eos> Uh, you don't have to drive him to school, Mr. Beeman.<eos> Oh, it's no problem.<eos> You want a ride, too?<eos> No.<eos> I'll-- I'll catch the bus.<eos> So, your parents had to go away last minute, huh?<eos> Yeah, they, uh-- A client in New York, a really big client, was threatening to fire them, so they had to go and-- and fix it.
Oh, yeah, those guys.<eos> You run into so many people at funerals.<eos> But isn't that guy with the machete your nephew?<eos> Ah, so it is!<eos> He's an odd duck traipsing around with that thing.<eos> The mustache is new.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Have these boys done something wrong?<eos> Probably, but we didn't get a chance to ask.<eos> They washed up on the shore of Lake Washington yesterday, missing their heads.
What job?<eos> With Tom?<eos> What are you doing to Tom?<eos> Let me out!<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Oh. There's nothing more depressing than a failed Communist state.<eos> It doesn't even really pay to be corrupt.<eos> When dirty cops play poker in America, they're able to play for real money.
I got it, okay. Oh, God!<eos> [chuckles] Psst! Ana, it's James.<eos> [groans] Oh! Hi!<eos> Hey. What a delightful surprise.<eos> I get to see you twice in one day.<eos> Actually, I can see you anytime I want.<eos> This place is covered in security cameras. I see everything...<eos> [chuckles]<eos> Which is why I never eat the deviled eggs on set.<eos> Because they sit out all day.
Dead?<eos> Who's dead?<eos> A little out of control?<eos> Promised the guys a party.<eos> It's a campaign year.<eos> So pretty soon, everybody's gonna be working around the clock.<eos> Figured this would be our last chance to cut loose.<eos> Boss of the Year.<eos> So, what happened?<eos> So, they were both dancing.
Huck, get rid of anything digital that can connect the agents with the two women... Hotel camera feeds, the reservations database.<eos> We're really gonna cover this up?<eos> It was an accident, and she was a hooker, so yes.<eos> In the morning, housekeeping finds a prostitute who overdosed.<eos> What they don't find is anyone else's DNA, any evidence, or anything suspicious.<eos> Bellhops, door guys, reception...<eos> anyone who could've seen the agents come up to the room gets paid.<eos> Those agents, they're more upset with the idea of getting caught than that poor woman dying.<eos> Makes you a little concerned for the President's safety, right?<eos> They make a mess, and we just clean it up?
What are you up to, Jake?<eos> Goodbye, Liv.<eos> So, is it gonna be the both of you?<eos> If so, I'll take you first.<eos> But no pics or videos, and if you want to go half and half, it's full price for both.<eos> But I don't charge to watch while you wait your turn.<eos> Hey, we'll pay you for your time, but we didn't ask you here for your... services.<eos> We need to know what happened the other night in that hotel suite with those agents.<eos> I already told you.<eos> No, you told us what they paid you to tell us.
Well, I don't have answers.<eos> I'll do a lot for money, but snitching isn't on the menu.<eos> You know, she didn't die right away.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Megan.<eos> After she bumped her head, she was still alive.<eos> If one of those agents had just made a call to 911, they would've saved her life.<eos> Those are the men you're protecting, Erin.<eos> Now, what really happened that night?<eos> And when those agents wouldn't pay her, they got into a fight.

I don't know.<eos> Should I have gone with "hi"?<eos> Hi.<eos> So...<eos> You have something important to discuss?<eos> I do.<eos> Members of your Secret Service detail were involved in the death of Megan Matthews, a prostitute whose body was found at the Dorsey Hotel a couple nights ago.<eos> My God.<eos> Your agents...<eos> They let her die, Fitz.
This is not why I came.<eos> Right.<eos> You came here to tell me about the Secret Service.<eos> Thanks for the heads-up.<eos> I can make it go away, but if I do that, then, Fitz, you're going to have to...<eos> Do not tell me what I have to do.<eos> You don't get to do that anymore.<eos> The fish rots from the head.<eos> What?<eos> Your boys in the Secret Service, they're taking their cues from you because you're the head of the fish...
That's like the...<eos> like... That's a doctor. You're like a surgeon.<eos> Like, the fur is now like, um...<eos> It's like down.<eos> It's like down fur.<eos> It's like...<eos> it's like the pillows!<eos> Before you think of saying anything, know this:<eos> I have people outside your house right now.<eos> And if they don't hear from me in exactly ten minutes, she's dead.
I couldn't resist.<eos> A little something for him to wear on the way home.<eos> Isn't that cute?<eos> Oh, I think he's finished.<eos> Oh, you think he is?<eos> Here. I'll get him.<eos> You come here.<eos> You come here to me.<eos> Oh. You know, my parents emailed.<eos> They should be here soon.

- What? - Mm-hmm.<eos> What happened?<eos> I've been getting these pounding headaches.<eos> His blood pressure spiked.<eos> Dr. Movitt put him on a nipride drip.<eos> - Pressure's coming down.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Christy Pierce, there's nothing I can do.<eos> You understand why the sale of human organs is illegal.<eos> Once they have monetary value, at best, poor people will sell them.
- In two layers.<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> Don't take that tone with me, Dr. Rhodes.<eos> I'm your attending.<eos> Right.<eos> Close him up.<eos> Unless Dr. Zanetti would prefer to.<eos> Maggie. Why are you out here and not with Natalie?<eos> Oh, um, her... her parents flew in from Seattle, so...<eos> they're in there with her.
Mr. Blevins? Mind if we talk?<eos> Nurse says I'm being discharged.<eos> Yeah, we're almost finished with the paperwork.<eos> Then what's there to talk about?<eos> My brother.<eos> He's a cop.<eos> Good for you.<eos> He tells me stories about dumb crimes people commit.<eos> He says there are no smart criminals.<eos> If they were smart, they wouldn't be criminals.
And without it, the cost of surgery on your arm, that'd be pretty expensive.<eos> Not to mention the cost of cancer treatments.<eos> Those could easily exceed $200,000.<eos> Man, what do you want from me?<eos> You wanted to get caught... because in... in prison, health care is free.<eos> You don't owe me an answer, but your wife, she ought to know the truth.<eos> Bobby suffered another ischemic stroke, much more severe this time.<eos> His judgment remains impaired despite the medications we've given him, and we have noticed further changes to his temperament.<eos> - What kind of changes?<eos> - They're profound.
And not lesions on the brain?<eos> I mean, what if there's no such thing as saints?<eos> What if Mother Theresa, Gandhi, Saint Francis... They all just...<eos> were people who suffered<eos> - a stroke to the frontal lobe?<eos> - Who knows? Theories abound.<eos> I mean, as a shrink, I'm supposed to tell you that we project saintly qualities onto others 'cause we need to.<eos> Makes us feel hopeful.<eos> Hm. But this I know for certain:<eos> whoever those people were or weren't, they absolutely understood the power of a simple act of human kindness.
What I heard was a newly elected President auditioning a bunch of new ideas.<eos> I don't know, Saul.<eos> She gave us very little love today.<eos> Hmm. She'll learn to love us.<eos> I'm not sure where all this rosy optimism is coming from, but I don't like it.<eos> Can we order some food in here?<eos> I'm starving.<eos> It's not just that her ideas are naive and dangerous.<eos> It's that she didn't exactly campaign on them.<eos> I'm not sure the American people are getting what they bargained for.
Last night, I couldn't find his landmarks at first.<eos> I almost went into the wrong membrane.<eos> - Forceps, please.<eos> - I couldn't even dilate with my own finger.<eos> At least you didn't nick the inferior thyroid artery.<eos> I'm telling you, I was a mess.<eos> Bovie again, please.<eos> It was years ago now.<eos> But my parents and I got into a huge fight the day I graduated from medical school.<eos> They said I had an attitude problem 'cause I refused to pose for the usual smiling white-coat photos.
As I thought.<eos> The mushrooms the professor has in his tea are pure psilocybe azurescens, also known as Blue Angels.<eos> They are a potent and relatively rare species native to the Columbia River Delta.<eos> There's not a toadstool in the pot.<eos> And you can tell that just by looking?<eos> Identifying fungi is one of a host of skills a good detective should have.<eos> These people died quickly.<eos> Note the lack of smearing in the various effluvia.<eos> No one tried to stagger for help or to crawl for the door.<eos> They died where they fell, meaning they were exposed to a highly concentrated poison.

I don't think it ever came up.<eos> You remember the newly-inked tattoo on Charlotte's shoulder?<eos> A griffin. Mm.<eos> If I'm not mistaken, it was by the same artist that did that tattoo.<eos> What was the name of the tattoo shop?<eos> Any progress?<eos> Incremental, but significant.<eos> I was able to contact Charlotte's tattoo artist, Aviv, who told me the tale of Charlotte and her newest beau,<eos> So they went into the shop together.<eos> As people are wont to do when they wish to immortalize their love via the tattoo needle.
You're offering to cooperate?<eos> I'm offering to burn Zerakem to the ground.<eos> Miss Pal gave us everything.<eos> Every memo that anyone at Zerakem ever wrote about the New Jersey expansion, every e-mail.<eos> The only way any of it would be useful is lining the bottom of several thousand birdcages.<eos> Oh, you're not finding anything.<eos> I found a great deal.<eos> All of it indicates that, in all likelihood, Zerakem did not kill Charlotte Konig.<eos> As recently as two days ago, the senior management were instructing their lawyers to attempt to identify the principals behind the land trust.<eos> They didn't know it was Charlotte.

You were the one she wanted to take revenge against.<eos> She tried to hold you up on the divorce, right?<eos> Claimed a chunk of the proceeds from your books.<eos> After all, she helped you do the research.<eos> That's why you had them pulled, to spite her.<eos> This is all conjecture.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> You recently hired a private detective, one Duane Weaver.<eos> Fortunately for us, P.I.s are not legally bound by client privilege.<eos> They're quite free to discuss their cases with the police.
Alicia, I need you to get the hell out.<eos> He's been in jail for eight months.<eos> He lost his job, his wife.<eos> His son is with child services.<eos> - And you want to do what for him?<eos> - Get him out.<eos> Schakowsky is never gonna change the trial date, you know that.<eos> He will if we sue him.<eos> Judges have immunity.<eos> Not if they knowingly violate a defendant's civil rights.
Any reporter worth his salt is gonna photograph how empty this all is.<eos> Well, that's why I got a reporter who isn't worth his salt.<eos> Democratic Presidential candidate Peter Florrick is on pace to complete "the Full Monty," a feat only attempted by the bravest politicians:<eos> visiting all of the 70... 89 Iowa counties by the 5:00 p.m. cutoff.<eos> And here to tell the tale is none other than the candidate himself, Peter Florrick.<eos> Good to see you, Ted.<eos> And good to see you, too.<eos> And it looks like your fans are out in force today.<eos> We love you, Peter!<eos> They sure seem to love you.
The private lab which compared the two samples chalked it up to human error.<eos> We think the imposter had an accomplice, someone inside the lab who made sure to test her DNA against itself and then got rid of the toothbrush to prevent future tests.<eos> Frankly, Captain, I'm surprised you don't find our thesis more compelling.<eos> I find it compelling as hell, but I also think I'm the only parent in the room.<eos> You know your kids.<eos> I don't care if they're gone ten years or 50.<eos> You know them.<eos> How many of your children have been kidnapped?<eos> I'm merely pointing out that these parents could hardly be blamed for falling prey to a charlatan.<eos> They dreamt of their daughter's safe return for over a decade.

This is why you're here.<eos> Look, I just took pictures of them.<eos> Why?<eos> Well they're both very attractive young people.<eos> It's what I do for a living. I discover talent.<eos> I didn't know beauty qualified as talent.<eos> Talent is in the eye of the beholder.<eos> A lot of my clients have gone on to very successful careers.<eos> I mean, look at these faces.<eos> They're naturally beautiful.
The fee for the treatment is $5,000.<eos> No problem.<eos> Then you need to fill out this paperwork.<eos> I-I got to say, are you sure you need this treatment?<eos> Oh. One can never look too young.<eos> Hi. Have you had this treatment before?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> It's my first time.<eos> I know it's expensive, but my friends look amazing.<eos> And they're older than me.
Oh, please.<eos> Don't flatter yourself.<eos> When I was the Evil Queen, I spent every day not giving a damn about anyone.<eos> And in return, no one... cared about me.<eos> I thought all I needed was my vengeance to keep me warm at night.<eos> But then something happened.<eos> My enemies... became my family.<eos> And that's when I finally felt happy.<eos> That is why I'm here.<eos> They need my help, and when family needs help, you step up.
- And he totally bolted soon<eos> - as he saw me.<eos> - Great.<eos> If you could just keep what you saw tonight to yourself.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know what?<eos> I can do that.<eos> I just... I think it'd be fair if you do the same with me.<eos> - Ophelia... - Look, it seems to me that these burglaries aren't just a one-off.<eos> Could really send some people into a panic if they found out that they were all related.
Are... are you okay?<eos> I'm surprisingly okay, which is probably not okay.<eos> But I just feel like I just railed a gram of coke to the face.<eos> - Something you've done before?<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Amphetamines give me diarrhea.<eos> - Wow, you just say anything.<eos> - It is part of my charm.<eos> Is that what your parents tell you?<eos> No, they tell me I'm a mistake.
I heard the broadcasts from Jackson, and I know the legend.<eos> It's not a legend.<eos> It's the truth.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> Then why do you go after him like he's some sort of criminal while my friends are being held captive 10,000 miles away?<eos> I get that you're enamored with the guy, but you've been in your own little bubble with him for awhile now.<eos> Out here in post-plague America, there are real concerns about the new President.<eos> And I'm not just talking about this hostage situation.<eos> Well, then, people have a pretty short memory.<eos> They remember the fall of the last government and how it felt to be abandoned.
Why us?<eos> You needed to pay for what you did to my country.<eos> Look.<eos> We had... we had reports of possible mutation.<eos> What if those reports are right?<eos> What you're doing is making things worse.<eos> You can't send the ships back to America, you got to send them into Japan.<eos> Let them investigate.<eos> Our doctors will help.<eos> They'll help.
This situation is fluid, to say the least.<eos> But we're hoping that Captain Chandler can give us some answers before the deadline.<eos> What I really need from everyone right now is time... time to assess the dynamic situation across the world, time for Captain Chandler to do what he does.<eos> He got us this far.<eos> We owe him that much.<eos> Mr. President, the next few hours will determine the future, for better or worse.<eos> But you have my support.<eos> Mine, too, Mr. President.<eos> Jeffrey, you know I don't agree with your recent policy moves, the rations, the property laws and such, and I can safely say that the good survivors of TexArkana will not abide a strong, central government coming out of Missouri<eos> if they don't have confidence in a non-elected President.
I'm gonna splatter it all over the floor.<eos> Yeah, well, good luck, it runs like maple syrup.<eos> Look, I'm just saying<eos> I don't like exercising as much as you do.<eos> Nobody likes exercising.<eos> They like how they feel when they're done.<eos> In other words, when they're not exercising.<eos> Honey, I know how hard it is to get started up again, but it is worth it.<eos> Look at all these clothes.<eos> They're too big!
Pablo Gonzalez, 34 years old, five entries, no exit.<eos> Literally.<eos> No exit, anywhere.<eos> We found some shell casings, but no murder weapon yet.<eos> What is this place?<eos> Neighbors say cars pull up day and night, dropping men off.<eos> A revolving door.<eos> It's a brothel?<eos> Patrol swept the place.<eos> They found four women believed to be prostitutes.
Okay. Bye.<eos> Um, glad to hear you're feeling better.<eos> this is gonna be out of the blue, but, um...<eos> I... I... I know this is...<eos> You want to grab a drink or something?<eos> God, I'm...<eos> I'm sorry, Gordon, but we're not supposed to do that.<eos> You know, doctors and patients.<eos> Fascists.<eos> And you know, uh, what... what they don't know is that there's this great place in Koreatown that has the most...
The physicians in Trauma One think center stage is an operating room.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Oh, you always have.<eos> All surgeons are physicians.<eos> Not all physicians are surgeons.<eos> And all surgeons can't do what we do.<eos> And what is that, exactly?<eos> The work of a surgeon in a battlefield setting, blind with one arm tied behind our back.<eos> I know my people.<eos> If they hadn't have acted...
We gave Gina the best chance to survive.<eos> And the proof of that is a dead woman.<eos> I've been a surgeon here at Angels for 12 years.<eos> Operated on movie stars, billionaires, the Vice President of the United States.<eos> Meanwhile, the sum total of your experience here is as an E.R. resident, my man.<eos> It's been a long time since I was a resident, my man.<eos> I'm a doctor, same as you.<eos> Ah, no.<eos> No.<eos> See, your patients come to you 'cause they have to.

We have a few more questions, specifically about Gordon Heshman.<eos> You and Dr. Angus Leighton treated him in center stage, correct?<eos> Yes.<eos> Was there an attending supervising?<eos> Dr. Mike Leighton and Dr. Neal Hudson.<eos> But they were tending to other patients, so you and Angus Leighton were working alone?<eos> Standard operating procedure.<eos> They're doctors.<eos> I'm simply trying to ascertain whether the two residents treating Mr. Heshman were capable.<eos> They're more than capable.
Well, what else did Justina tell you about her?<eos> Sometimes a specific detail can help.<eos> "Mrs. Beasley doll"?<eos> Yeah, it's a long story.<eos> Is that her?<eos> My mother was a drug addict.<eos> The first time I was taken from her, I was two-years-old and I was placed in several foster homes until I was around seven when I was finally placed with a loving couple whom weren't able to have children of their own, and I made my first best friend there.<eos> She gave me her Mrs. Beasley doll.<eos> But one night, social workers came and they took me away.<eos> They didn't even let me take my doll.
I was trying to surprise you.<eos> I was trying to find Lizzie.<eos> I think it's gonna be pretty hard to track her down.<eos> Because you're Lizzie.<eos> I, um, I founds this video and in it, you were telling the same story.<eos> Her story.<eos> Why wouldn't you want me to know that you were a foster kid too?<eos> Call, I didn't tell you I was a foster kid because I wasn't.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> I used to go to these fund-raisers all the time and I would tell Lizzie's story and people would listen politely... but they were never moved by it... until one day, I told it as my own.
I think it's my own version of... of... of Ellen's tatoo.<eos> I think it's, you know, my... my symbol of confidence.<eos> I've always wanted to cut my hair really short.<eos> Well, why haven't you done it until now?<eos> 'Cause I was afraid I was going to look like a dyke.<eos> I hate that I have my own internalized homophobia.<eos> But, um... just really been struggling, really been struggling with, with... the way people are going to look at me without breasts.<eos> As if I, uh... as if I'm somehow less of a woman, less feminine.<eos> But you know what? Breasts and long hair do not make me a woman.<eos> And what the hell do I care if people think that I'm butch because they have an idea of what a woman is supposed to look like.
Uh, yeah, of course.<eos> What about me?<eos> Tried to get off the list a few years back.<eos> You know, didn't happen.<eos> Talked to a lawyer, she said it was almost impossible.<eos> Impossible if you don't have a letter of support from the... from Ana and her parents, the people who called the cops on you in the first place.<eos> Your folks are willing to do that?<eos> I think they will be.<eos> So you haven't asked them?<eos> They're thinking about it.
Okay. Let's go.<eos> ♪ Tell me what you're thinking ♪<eos> Tired of dancing?<eos> Uh, no, just taking a break.<eos> Yeah, actually, I should probably go soon.<eos> Already?<eos> Yeah. I have a paper due Monday.<eos> Leaving a party to go do homework.<eos> Your parents expect a lot from you, huh?<eos> They just want me to succeed.
We love having you, my sweet.<eos> Baby, love.<eos> What's wrong, honey?<eos> Ana's here, and I think she's high or something.<eos> Um, so how many of you are there, again?<eos> Uh, well, I have two moms,<eos> Callie, who they just adopted, and her little brother Jude.<eos> They've lived with us for like, a year now.<eos> And then there's the twins, Jesus and Mariana.<eos> I think we adopted them when they were like six and I was seven.

_<eos> Meet Grace LeGare.<eos> Victim of hemlock poisoning.<eos> She was a librarian, collapsed at work three days ago.<eos> She's been in hospital since.<eos> Died, obviously.<eos> But doctors couldn't figure out the underlying cause.<eos> She's 30 and otherwise healthy.<eos> Makes no sense.<eos> So they send her to us.
A big Danny Trejo fan?<eos> Better do your math, son.<eos> There's three of us and there's one of you.<eos> You're right. You're right, man.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I really should've...<eos> Bad day at school, kiddo?<eos> Yeah, I nearly just got my ass handed to me.<eos> Boss' guys figured out there's a rat.<eos> And there's only so much time before they know it's me.
Oh, they're from the police. They're looking into Grace's murder.<eos> Oh. It's awful, isn't it?<eos> This is my husband.<eos> Did you need anything else?<eos> Here's my card.<eos> If you think of anything, don't hesitate to call.<eos> Or if we don't hear from you, maybe we'll drop back by.<eos> Thank you, Detectives.<eos> Why do people bury license plates?<eos> Do they think cars are going to grow out of the ground?
Minor, guess who found some bones!<eos> Good night of making rich white people less fat?<eos> Yeah, it's God's work, what I do.<eos> Where's Minor?<eos> Gone, I'm afraid.<eos> Gone?<eos> Gone where?<eos> I saw a missing dog flyer on a telephone pole with a photo of Minor.<eos> So I called the number, the owners swung by and picked him up.<eos> They must've been thrilled.

Happy ending.<eos> Bummer for us, though.<eos> Yeah, I do wish I could've said goodbye.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. I just...<eos> You know, they got here so fast.
Should we see what he wants?<eos> I sure don't want my hole to go to waste.<eos> Yeah, Chief, "That's what she said."<eos> Don't bother.<eos> (GRUNTS)<eos> So?<eos> Your customers aren't dead.<eos> I can bring them back to you.<eos> Eventually.<eos> They're not dead?
So?<eos> Your customers aren't dead.<eos> I can bring them back to you.<eos> Eventually.<eos> They're not dead?<eos> Hey, Blaine!<eos> You can get your dad back!<eos> How badly do you want to see your dad again?<eos> My handlers don't care which zombie I take out next as long as I make my way steadily down my list.<eos> And they have you freeze them?
My handlers don't care which zombie I take out next as long as I make my way steadily down my list.<eos> And they have you freeze them?<eos> -They think I'm killing them.<eos> -Killing sounds easier.<eos> Yeah, except I'm not a murderer.<eos> I bet you tell that to all the families grieving for their loved ones.<eos> (MAKES POPPING SOUND)<eos> So, how did they find you?<eos> Help wanted ad? "Zombie killer needed."<eos> They knew Liv was a zombie.
You worked for Leslie Morgan?<eos> I loved Leslie.<eos> That woman believed in second chances.<eos> Where were you at 8:30 this morning?<eos> It's my day off.<eos> So, home in bed.<eos> Can anyone verify that?<eos> I'm currently between lovers.<eos> Could you ask her about the old fixtures?<eos> They went missing a few weeks ago.
What?<eos> Four hundred years.<eos> That's the combined prison sentence of the guys, my guys, the district attorney's office has convicted.<eos> How do you think they'd feel if they heard you, the rat putting them away, were my new business partner?<eos> Conflicted?<eos> You ever play Dungeons Dragons, Blaine?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No. I did.<eos> I was a hell of a dungeon master.<eos> If players screwed up, they did something dumb, they paid the price.

Yes.<eos> Let me know if he contacts you.<eos> What was that about?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> You know, I'm having trouble locating Nick.<eos> I could use some help sussing out the other woman if you're not otherwise occupied.<eos> Hey, ladies.<eos> Cops are here.<eos> They've got a couple of questions about Cassidy.
So who's John Deaux?<eos> My nom de guerre.<eos> Why do you need an alias to own a funeral home?<eos> Don't worry about the deed.<eos> Your job is to upsell the bereaved.<eos> You got that covered?<eos> Yeah, for the most part.<eos> I can remember coffin models and prices like it's the days of the week, but when clients come in from before,<eos> I'm lost.<eos> They seem to know me, but I have no clue who they are.
"Babineaux as a lone wolf with a real Serpico complex."<eos> "Unnamed sources"?<eos> Hey, can I help you?<eos> Bailey Barker visited here two nights ago, sometime after 10:00.<eos> The murdered girl?<eos> - Were you working that night?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it was just me, but she never came in here.<eos> Her meal card was charged here.<eos> Look, sometimes when people's cards are maxed, they use a friend's.
- Anything?<eos> No, and local frequencies are clear.<eos> They all had radios, and not one of them had a chance to contact us.<eos> - Must've been a very quick hit.<eos> - You were right.<eos> We should've warned them earlier.<eos> It was a tough call.<eos> Okay. St. Louis said stay offshore, but they didn't say we had to sit here with our thumbs up our asses.<eos> You want to find those three boats?<eos> They disappeared around that bay one hour before the attack.
That's the same ship that ID'd itself as the Chinese Class B fishing vessel.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I believe so, sir.<eos> You can change your call sign, but not the way your engine rattles.<eos> Gator, tell the OOD to get us closer.<eos> - Roger.<eos> - Any sign of those other two ships?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - It's been five hours.<eos> They could be long gone by now.

TAO, give me full radar and sonar sweeps of the area.<eos> OOD, make course along that bearing.<eos> Right standard rudder, steady course 3-5-0.<eos> You better be right about that ship, 'cause we're running low on fuel and in the next 10 minutes, we're gonna be in the drink.<eos> SOP says they'll be within a 20-mile radius of Hai Phong.<eos> We got to be within radio range by now.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> Suitable extraction points would be here, here, and here, but it's gonna take at least 20 minutes to close the distance.<eos> Hey, Burky, where the hell are they?<eos> They should be closer to shore.
What is your emergency?<eos> We've been flooded with reports of people having issues calling 911 from cell phones.<eos> They say they connect to an operator, but then the call drops off and their phone freezes in call mode.<eos> What makes you think that this is a cyber intrusion and not a malfunction of the New York City 911 system?<eos> Well, we've checked and double-checked.<eos> There's no evidence of a mechanical malfunction.<eos> Our IT guys believe it's a hack within our system that affects incoming cell phone calls.<eos> Anyone who places a call from a land line doesn't experience the problem.<eos> Have you ruled out issues with cell service providers?<eos> They've all confirmed that cell towers in the city are properly functioning and all other wireless phone traffic is normal.
Is there a way to get in touch with them?<eos> I'd like to take a look at their devices.<eos> Yeah, I can, uh, I can get you their home number.<eos> This is crazy.<eos> That kid was only 20 years old.<eos> Bled to death because I couldn't get the paramedics here in time.<eos> And now, two more of my guys are in the hospital in critical condition.<eos> I hope you can figure this out.<eos> You know, on jobs like this, something happens every day on these sites.<eos> I need to know that my guys can get help when they need it.
So this bus has been, like,<eos> "sneezing" all over town.<eos> Every unsecured router in its path has been infected?<eos> Andwhenever a Wi-Fi enabled phone connects to one of these infected routers, it gets the virus.<eos> Malware automatically jumps onto it.<eos> It's contagious.<eos> I've never seen anything in the wild like this before.<eos> Can the virus jump from phone to phone?<eos> No.<eos> Phones can only get the virus if they're connected to one of the infected routers.
Matter of fact, I will call Director Silver right now.<eos> Work on the FCC, DOJ part of this thing.<eos> All right, man said hack, let's hack.<eos> Look at this.<eos> A pair of pliers, some kind of metal pins and a bloody violin string.<eos> I think we may be looking at the murder weapon.<eos> All right, well, whatever Leo's endgame is, if he left two bodies upstairs and a murder weapon in the wall, it's a pretty safe bet he's not coming back here anytime soon.<eos> Guys, look at this.<eos> It looks like these three 911 recordings were Leo's favorites.<eos> They were played over a thousand times.
Well, then Raj and I will...<eos> Nope.<eos> Very well. Stuart.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Do that.<eos> Ugh. Stuart.<eos> Hi, Sheldon. What's new?<eos> Our friends are jerks, and I'm mad at all of them.<eos> I said, "What's new?" but sure.<eos> Can you believe they planned a trip to Las Vegas and didn't invite me?
Nope.<eos> Very well. Stuart.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Do that.<eos> Ugh. Stuart.<eos> Hi, Sheldon. What's new?<eos> Our friends are jerks, and I'm mad at all of them.<eos> I said, "What's new?" but sure.<eos> Can you believe they planned a trip to Las Vegas and didn't invite me?<eos> Did you refuse to apologize and act like they were stupid for being mad?
An Indian guy outsourcing a computer job to a white fella.<eos> Yeah, okay, whatever it takes to keep you busy for a few hours.<eos> Found one.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> There are millions of data points there.<eos> But, look, an optical transient.<eos> Yeah, maybe that is something.<eos> How did you find that?<eos> It wasn't difficult.<eos> You know how when you see prime numbers, they appear red, but when they're twin primes, they're pink and smell like gasoline?
It's perfect.<eos> It appears romantic, but it's really just a rock in space that gets me out of Valentine's Day forever.<eos> So, uh, what were you thinking?<eos> Combine their names? I like it.<eos> Yeah, we'll take the "A-M" from Amy and, uh, the "Y" from Emily.<eos> That's just Amy.<eos> Exactly. See how well we work together?<eos> And in double-blind studies, Placinex proved extremely effective in treating all kinds of anxiety.<eos> Actually, funny story-- the boys in the lab were worried about getting FDA approval for Placinex;<eos> they started taking it, stopped worrying.
A cop?<eos> A DGSE agent?<eos> DGSl?<eos> No...<eos> Keep your mouth shut!<eos> Ask yourself if your god will rescue you.<eos> They're almost in Syria.<eos> Via Guvecci.<eos> And our 2 men?<eos> They can intercept them before the border.
He isn't some poor jerk taken in by a sect.<eos> He's an expert in living undercover.<eos> When Cyclone brings up the lawyer, Matthieu Coujard, to Yacine Boumaza, does Yacine suspect anything?<eos> is it the sister who suspects the cops are onto them? Either way, she comes to see Raymond.<eos> She sniffs around, to form her own opinion.<eos> Maybe he's a real lawyer, maybe not.<eos> She calls her brother. And she uses a code.<eos> "Mom is sick."<eos> She already suspects her phone is tapped.<eos> Toufik had told her, "They'll be clever.

- I've been dumped a lot?<eos> - Please. I read you guys the moment I got there.<eos> Nick's deal is, he honest-to-God might be 50.<eos> Schmidt's deal is he had to Shazam "Stairway to Heaven."<eos> And your deal is you've been dumped a lot.<eos> You're pretty good. You're pretty good.<eos> How did Nick go through so many napkins, yet get salsa everywhere?<eos> We've got no privacy, and it has been way, way, way too long since Mama got her biscuits.<eos> And the biscuits... are rising.<eos> I hope they stick to the pan and get a little brown
You know what, she should have, and I told her that.<eos> It's the least she could have done.<eos> Hey, you're preaching to the choir.<eos> Ask me how many times I've been dumped.<eos> - I don't have the...<eos> - 47 times. And once on my birthday.<eos> And out of that 47 times and once on my birthday, do you know what part hurts the most?<eos> - Getting bailed on.<eos> - Getting bailed on.<eos> Why do people think they can just disappear on you?

Adrien Treuille was one of the creators of a video game calling upon the community of video gamers out there in the world.<eos> Here we can see an RNA molecule folded up into this beautiful helical pattern, it forms a helix, and the amazing thing is that this pattern is formed out of very, very simple rules which pull it together and create this shape.<eos> And so it's a little bit like... you can think of your hands as there are simple rules which determine how it can bend, and then there are certain ways in which it loves to come together to form a compact shape<eos> and that's just what these molecules are doing in the body.<eos> And your shirts, for example, you are into shirt folding?<eos> These molecules fold up in much the same way that a shirt folds.<eos> You can imagine it starts completely unfolded and not at all suitable to put in your drawer, but if you follow very, very simple rules it becomes this beautiful package that you can then store and show.<eos> We took the latest scientific models of a biomolecule folding and we created a game and we put it on the web without knowing what would happen and without knowing if it would be fun at all, if anyone would come, and... instantly people arrived and they broke down the computers.<eos> We had to build new computers.<eos> And they played and they spoke with one another and they taught one another about the science as non-experts, and they began reading papers and they began studying and understanding.
Can you open it?<eos> It must be packed with electronics.<eos> - Show us.<eos> - Yes. So just like we humans have brains to basically process the incoming signals, we need to have computers, basically, which process all the signals from the lidars and the radars and the cameras.<eos> I can't see anything.<eos> It turns out there really is nothing to see.<eos> It's a completely useable empty trunk space, but hidden behind... under the... trunk, is a set of computers.<eos> There are four computers, each with four so called processing cores which is really equivalent to 16-piece personal computing machines which basically crunch all the data coming in from the sensors.<eos> These dots that you see are basically reflections from laser beams from the laser lidar sensors on the car.<eos> They emit light beams, hit obstacles, and they come back as reflections and they show up as dots.
To kick the ball, what these robots have is a main kicker, which slides the length of the robot and kicks the ball forward.<eos> We also have a chip kicker, which can kick the ball upward and that makes the ball go up into the air.<eos> These robots are autonomous.<eos> Nobody steers them with a joystick.<eos> Once a defender is in place, it'll be a bit more challenging for this robot to score.<eos> RoboCup this year we have not let in a single goal, although we scored 48 goals in total against our opponents.<eos> So you are world champion?<eos> We are.<eos> We came first this year in the RoboCup international competition.<eos> The blue robots need to have an indirect free kick so they're figuring out how they should pass between themselves.
Beautiful.<eos> - Do you love it?<eos> - Yes, we do.<eos> We do love robot 8.<eos> The day Nikki passed away we were scheduled to see a psychiatrist.<eos> She'd had some... psychotic issues where she had a brain tumor when she was very young and it was time to do some research on her.<eos> I think she was feeling nervous that if she were to go to this appointment she might get stuck in the hospital because that had happened before.<eos> And at some point a couple hours before her appointment, she left the house.<eos> She took Christos' Porsche and drove away.<eos> I saw all the police and I started to walk down the on-ramp and they stopped me and they said I wasn't allowed down there.

Things like microwave ovens can emit radiation which can blind us to the signals that are coming from the stars.<eos> Cell phones are billions of billions of times stronger than the faint signals we're looking for.<eos> Satellites, they beam straight down on us.<eos> - Music stations?<eos> - Music stations, yes.<eos> - Playing Elvis?<eos> - Playing Elvis.<eos> We've managed to keep cell phone transmissions out.<eos> Your smart phones are dumb here;<eos> they just do not work.
Wassup?<eos> This is a control room.<eos> Meet Lawrence Krauss.<eos> As a cosmologist he is studying the origins of our universe.<eos> Much of his attention has been focused on our planet.<eos> If there's a solar flare... if you destroyed the information fabric of the world right now, modern civilization would collapse.<eos> Hundreds of millions of people will die.<eos> Billions of people will die.<eos> The world will become, for people like you and me, unimaginably ugly, difficult, and... there's great likelihood that I couldn't survive.<eos> If the internet shuts down, people will not remember how they used to live before that.
If you disrupt those networks I imagine, what do they say?<eos> "Civilization is always about four square meals away from utter ruin"?<eos> That's something that it wouldn't be bad to prepare for.<eos> As we've thought about an internet of things where often for purely, looked at at this moment, unnecessary reasons, we not only attach daily objects to the internet but make them reliant on that internet connection in order to function properly.<eos> So the idea that our standard appliances couldn't work without connectivity, that we wouldn't be able to get... to a restaurant that in turn would be able to get to food and to organize staff...<eos> I suspect, however, that some individuals will survive.<eos> Let us remember that we come from a background where at one point there were less than a thousand individuals alive, probably down in the southern part of Africa, and we were a hair's breadth away from disappearing as a species.<eos> We have no control over what the sun chooses to do.<eos> We do know that there is a solar cycle, so there are times of high activity when there are many flares and there are times of low activity when there are relatively few.<eos> Events like the Carrington Event appear to be fairly uncommon but not non-existent, they're not single isolated events.
It looks devoid of its inhabitants.<eos> We have to assume that nearly everyone has left for a colony out there.<eos> # To a brighter sunny day # The planetarium is the only point of contact.<eos> Inside, a monument for those who have levitated and left.<eos> Yes, things must be real good out there.<eos> # But then we met some stragglers left behind.<eos> They're all on their smartphones.<eos> Have the monks stopped meditating?<eos> Have they stopped praying?<eos> They all seem to be tweeting.
They don't understand what they're looking at or what they're hearing or what they're learning.<eos> They depend upon the internet to tell them and decipher it.<eos> They look at numbers instead of ideas.<eos> They fail to understand concepts, and this is a problem.<eos> My hope would be there are still going to be the appeal of deep immersion in something, that through the school system we still subject our kids to, we can really to turn them onto its charms so they become intrinsically self-motivated to pursue it.<eos> Whether we use science or ancient Greek or philosophy, it's those tools that are important.<eos> Those are the things that people are gonna be able to use in the future.<eos> The actual information they learn in school won't be important because it'll be dwarfed by the information that's coming out on the internet every single day.<eos> Historians I think will also see an interesting thing.<eos> They'll probably call the time around now the Digital Dark Age.
Mike Pelman.<eos> I remember there was a Mike--<eos> No.<eos> Mike Belmont, Dennis Giza, and Marcus Levi.<eos> I can rule out Belmont.<eos> He's a stand-out agent, plus he's African-American.<eos> That leaves agents Giza and Levi.<eos> Yes, but Levi's cell phone pinged at the first and second crime scenes, and Giza's pinged at the first and third.<eos> Thanks.<eos> They only overlap on the first.

Around 11:00.<eos> I had a post-production meeting and forgot my external drive.<eos> So no one knew you'd be coming home this early?<eos> I--I come and go all day.<eos> I mean, I could have been here.<eos> I should have...<eos> Unlike the other victims, Mary Lenahan was married.<eos> The unsub took a serious risk targeting her.<eos> Yeah, spree killers lose their focus over time.<eos> They get caught up in the thrill of going from kill to kill and become less organized.
And grab him before he gets to his next victim.<eos> We need a safe house in the hunting zone.<eos> We've got one right in the middle.<eos> Well, he always strikes within two blocks of the crime scene.<eos> To be safe, we'll need every plainclothes officer and agent you have to cover a 3-block radius.<eos> I'll coordinate with LAPD.<eos> I can have 20 undercovers in place within the hour.<eos> Now, let's be clear about this-- we're luring a spree killer into an unsuspecting neighborhood, with dozens of potential victims.<eos> We'll need absolute radio silence.<eos> Colfax, if your people see anyone they suspect, they need to approach with caution, I.D. him, and be absolutely sure before they call it in.
You want to make sense of this.<eos> So you gotta start at the beginning.<eos> You gotta go way back.<eos> Where do we start?<eos> November 7, 1985.<eos> This is the block Derek was taken from.<eos> That blue dot is him.<eos> And then at 9:23, we lose him.<eos> So I checked all the other cell signals in the area.<eos> They're all legit, aside from one that I was only able to find thanks to some technology no one outside this room needs to know about.
Cut him loose.<eos> Why?<eos> I want him naked.<eos> Wait for this.<eos> Wait for it.<eos> Now.<eos> [Groaning]<eos> [Indistinct police radio]<eos> Hey. So I just talked to your neighbors.<eos> They didn't see anything, and I didn't find anything forensic outside.
Back to real life.<eos> What was this?<eos> So, you screwed us.<eos> You mean did we try to poach the clients you poached from us?<eos> - Did you? - Yes.<eos> Great.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> They said no.<eos> We can't get ahold of our clients.<eos> Yeah, because they're saying no to you, too.
You mean did we try to poach the clients you poached from us?<eos> - Did you? - Yes.<eos> Great.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> They said no.<eos> We can't get ahold of our clients.<eos> Yeah, because they're saying no to you, too.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> They want you as lawyers, but they want our infrastructure.<eos> And if they can't have both, they're gonna keep looking.
No, I'm choosing to get the fuck away from all of you.<eos> Hello, old friend.<eos> Been a while.<eos> Do say you missed me a little.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Let me cut to the chase.<eos> You will deliver yourself to me.<eos> Do it now, or do it when you've gone so mad you have nothing left, because I'm going to make it very, very loud.<eos> Here's the deal: people used to petition gods all the time to bestow power to work stuff that we'd never dream of.<eos> Now, they're it--biggest source there is.

There's no one to hear you.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Anyway, "God is dead"<eos> seems to be the consensus.<eos> I don't accept that.<eos> Well, Lamia seemed pretty convinced.<eos> She was a bitter, half-starved monster living in filth.<eos> The gods have abandoned her.<eos> It doesn't mean they're gone.
You're taking this a lot better than I would have.<eos> It's because there is bigger, better magic in the world.<eos> I mean, you would not believe some of the shit I've seen.<eos> I can barely believe it.<eos> Wha--what?<eos> Some friends and I got into some pretty eclectic shit.<eos> You and Kady?<eos> Where is she?<eos> On a mission.<eos> They all are.

I can bend light around us, all of us, the whole group, I think, make us invisible.<eos> It'll be difficult with the two suns but not impossible.<eos> We'll have to move in a pretty tight formation.<eos> When should we leave?<eos> As soon as possible.<eos> The suns are just about in position.<eos> It has begun!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Penny, Eliot, you're both tall, so you'll have to duck down and stay close to me, okay?<eos> - Or they'll see you.
Completely covered one whole side of her face, lifted up her bra and her panties, drew on her private parts, um, wrote nasty things on her body, and then... um, sexually assaulted her.<eos> The next morning, I went and I picked her up.<eos> And I noticed right away that she had green marker down the side of her leg.<eos> And I said, "Why do you have green pen on you?"<eos> And she made some excuse like, "Oh, so-and-so did something."<eos> She said, "I'm scared.<eos> What if... I did something that I didn't wanna do."<eos> Uh, she had no clue about the pictures, though.<eos> And I remember, I think maybe during break or during lunch or something, I saw a group of boys just, like, crowded around.<eos> They were looking down, so it looked like they were looking at a phone.

This is unprecedented, to bring these women together, and their moms... that collectively have made such a difference.<eos> I know that this is scary, but that's why we need to get our stories and our experiences out there for other moms and other high school survivors, so they know that they're not alone and that this happens a lot.<eos> Whoever wants to share first.<eos> Okay. Um, I guess I'll go.<eos> Okay, well, basically, when I was 16, uh, my parents went out of town and I had two girlfriends that were supposedly spending the night.<eos> And I did not know, but they invited three boys over, two of which I had never met before.<eos> And, um... we were all smoking weed and I had never done that before.<eos> After a while, I remember everything just got really, like, uneven.<eos> So, I got up and I went to my room and the two boys followed me in and they had locked the door.<eos> I was really confused and didn't really know what was going on and they sexually assaulted me.

They both just continuously raped me for six hours, until I woke up.
Come on, Johnny.<eos> We said our goodbyes to Audrie.<eos> But, I mean, we kept thinking, you know, "What could have been so bad that would've driven her to this?"<eos> After the night of the sexual assault, her communications were captured on Facebook Messenger.<eos> Sometimes the person tormenting her was faceless or nameless.<eos> We know from what she said in her process of investigating her own crime that she felt, because of what had happened to her, her reputation was ruined.<eos> And it was ruined forever.<eos> She didn't see... any light at the end of the tunnel, any future.<eos> The boys, they were 15 at the time.<eos> They were convicted of having child pornography, um, and committing, um, sexual battery.

There was drinking involved, and it's not like... we thought everything was okay.<eos> - I mean, yeah... - Nothing was okay, but... I've always felt, like, not okay about it.<eos> Like, I don't know, every day or so.<eos> I don't know what I really thought back then.<eos> But I just never imagined anything like what happened now.<eos> I don't know. I didn't imagine my whole life to be changed...<eos> Yeah, I don't know.<eos> Like, forever changed, so...<eos> Personally, I don't know what has happened with the boys since that night.<eos> But I have a feeling that, you know, since they haven't had to go through as much crap as I have, that they haven't really had time to reflect on who they are as people or else they would've stepped forward and taken responsibility.
The case will end badly.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Well done.<eos> Wow, you're really good<eos> At what?<eos> At hiding your feelings.<eos> You knew I would find the recruitment file.<eos> Did you think I wouldn't guess your name was blacked-out?<eos> You learn to take the hits.<eos> They come from within, not without.
No! And make no mistake about it.<eos> What he wants is your immortal soul.<eos> - All: No!<eos> - He does.<eos> Satan, come on out.<eos> You can't hide.<eos> Come on! Come into me.<eos> I'm not afraid.<eos> You leave these souls alone.<eos> Their sins, whatever they were, are now mine.
I let myself be possessed by Satan, and then I cast him out with my faith.<eos> And you don't let people take pictures of that, why?<eos> What I do is dangerous.<eos> It's not a show, some performance to be cheapened on the internet.<eos> People would just assume it's a trick.<eos> You think the devil literally possesses you?<eos> You come and watch, and then you tell me Satan isn't real.<eos> So why all the bodyguards?<eos> People see what happens to me, they get scared.<eos> Sometimes they attack.
All of Dwight Eleazar's guards have had issue with the law.<eos> Car theft, vandalism, assault, disorderly conduct.<eos> Some did a little time, but all that seemed to stop when they started working for him.<eos> Maybe they found a little salvation working for Dwight.<eos> Second chances inspire loyalty.<eos> I pulled up some newspaper articles.<eos> Seems like during Dwight's tent revivals, he actually gets possessed by the devil.<eos> This happens a lot?<eos> Apparently.<eos> Eyewitnesses are quoted as saying they've seen Dwight possessed by Satan and then casting him out.
Ah, that wasn't the deal.<eos> I want it now.<eos> Right now.<eos> The only way to save Dwight is through us.<eos> And what if it goes wrong?<eos> He'll know I betrayed him.<eos> If you don't help us, the devil will take him.<eos> Forever.<eos> Get me the money or it's on you.<eos> So, do you think the people who work for Dwight know he's Wesen, or do they actually think he's possessed by the devil too?

Is it just to save souls or is it about the money?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, and I think...<eos> You do know what I'm talking about, unless you haven't heard of a Decapitare, or a Grimm.<eos> Yeah, I've heard of a Decapitare, but I never thought I'd meet one.<eos> You're supposed to cut my head off, aren't you?<eos> Do the people that work for you know you're Wesen?<eos> No.<eos> So, it's just a show.<eos> I have a gift, and I use it to help people.<eos> They come to me beaten down, broken, full of guilt for the things they've done wrong and I take that guilt from them.
No.<eos> But do I relieve them from their suffering?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> You've ordered your people to stop anyone from taking photos of what you do.<eos> Yeah, if anyone were to see it on a screen, they'd think what I do is fake.<eos> How far does your order go?<eos> Does it include physical violence?<eos> No, I don't condone violence.<eos> My bodyguards have had more difficult lives.<eos> If someone gets physical with them, they respond.
Well, perhaps that's a convenient outcome for whoever commissioned the crime.<eos> ♪ Elementary 4x14 ♪ Who Is That Masked Man Original Air Date on February 25, 2016<eos> Excuse me, excuse me.<eos> Thank you, sorry. Thank you.<eos> That's quite an audience today.<eos> If it wasn't for the lack of paparazzi, I'd assume a reality TV star got vivisected.<eos> Three Chinese gangsters got shotgunned.<eos> So less fun.<eos> These folks are nervous.<eos> They're worried this could be the beginning of a gang war.
Previously on The Vampire Diaries<eos> What the hell did you do?<eos> I can't protect Mystic Falls on my own, so I made some friends who could help.<eos> Who are these friends?<eos> Alaric's babies are the future of the coven.<eos> They're inside of you.
Good.<eos> You made it. Where the hell are we?<eos> This is the Armory, home to a society of supernatural artifact collectors.<eos> We keep them under lock and key so they don't fall into the wrong hands.<eos> The Armory... Never heard of it.<eos> - You? - No.<eos> Yeah, that's kind of the point.<eos> They've taken great care to keep themselves out of history as we know it.<eos> And for three easy payments of $19.99, we, too, can be members.<eos> How about we just cut to the part where they can save my brother?
Just fine.<eos> You all right?<eos> What happened?<eos> Heydrich's in prison, where he belongs.<eos> He'll be questioned... and hanged as a traitor.<eos> So it's over.<eos> Heydrich has allies in Berlin:<eos> Men prepared to betray the Führer, just as he was.<eos> You have to arrest them.<eos> We would if we knew who they were.
There were shadows of some of the victims.<eos> They were like... like burns.<eos> It was...<eos> The end.<eos> What about people?<eos> - What about them?<eos> - Did you see any after the explosion?<eos> Come on.<eos> There were men lined up by Nazi soldiers.<eos> They looked like they were with the Resistance...
- Mine too.<eos> My favorite!<eos> Rajesh Khanna the super star's song!<eos> Look at your son!<eos> "Bye-bye!"<eos> "Bye-bye!" "Bye-bye miss, goodnight. We'll meet again tomorrow."<eos> "Bye-bye miss, goodnight. We'll meet again tomorrow." "The day was colorful, the dazzling night has arrived."<eos> For Navjeevan society!<eos> That was amazing! And now a special performance by my parents!<eos> They are going to sing!

Open the door!<eos> Huh?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> They are all going to die because of you.<eos> Get up!<eos> Everyone, go down.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Move!<eos> The pilots escaped.<eos> How did they escape?
Kill!<eos> Pilot...! - The pilots will come.<eos> - No!<eos> We have to talk to him.<eos> - Be patient. Please stay calm!<eos> 30 minutes!<eos> Pilot no...<eos> - Kill!<eos> - 30 minutes are less, brother!<eos> I'm sure they'll agree to your demands.
Sit! Sit!<eos> Shut up!<eos> Sit. Sit.<eos> I am going.<eos> Go on. Khalil, control the passengers!<eos> Windows... shut them.<eos> Yes, speak.<eos> Fast... time!<eos> The French crew pilots will be here soon.<eos> How much longer? They're asking how much longer will it take.

Please protect my daughter!<eos> Please protect my daughter!<eos> Please protect my daughter!<eos> Sir.<eos> The target has opened the 2A window shutter.<eos> What's the order, sir? Don't shoot until you see all four targets.<eos> Sir, the plane lights are off!<eos> - The auxiliary power's run out.<eos> - Military has cut the power for the plane!<eos> - They are going to enter the plane!
Father had a security camera system.<eos> Could be something.<eos> What's with the gas masks?<eos> Get CFD down here.<eos> 19.8% oxygen levels are lower than usual.<eos> That means that there's another type of gas in here.<eos> Offenders pumped gas in, knocked the family right out.<eos> - Check this out. - Yeah.<eos> - Duct tape? - Yeah.<eos> They, uh, they ran tubing through here and circulated the gas through the ventilation system.
When we got there this morning, she was pretty out of it.<eos> But she says she was...<eos> - Right. Thanks. - Yeah.<eos> I'm Detective Dawson.<eos> This is Detective Lindsay.<eos> Can you tell us what happened?<eos> I got dinner with a friend I'm visiting, and I went to bed around... 9:30, maybe 9:45.<eos> And then around 11:00, I wake up to see these guys standing in my room.<eos> You saw them?<eos> I don't think they meant for that to happen, 'cause they pulled their masks down and I heard one of them say he needed more gas.

I assume you want our help because drones are involved.<eos> Correct.<eos> So far we have been able to confiscate 85% of the shipments coming across the border.<eos> Trucks, tunnels, airplanes.<eos> Are you telling me all the drugs in the U.S. only account for 15% of the potential supply?<eos> Imagine if the rest got in via drone.<eos> Bad guys always adapt.<eos> The U.S. and our Mexican allies, we feel that the drone was a test flight for a new delivery system.<eos> Well, drones make sense.<eos> They're small, they're hard to spot. They don't need runways or other infrastructure.
151 degrees!<eos> Uh, Doc?<eos> You seeing this?<eos> Walter, we got a sky full of bogies on its way.<eos> This isn't a test flight.<eos> This is a full shipment.<eos> He's right.<eos> There's scores of them heading towards us.<eos> Let's shoot 'em down.<eos> There's no way that pulse-gun will take out all those drones before they get past us.
Pulse-gun's not working any more.<eos> They're out of range.<eos> They're too far.<eos> Sly?<eos> Happy, you okay?<eos> Uh, yeah, we're... we're all okay.<eos> Bad guys must've got Intel that law enforcement was onto them.<eos> Decided to rush a shipment through.<eos> And arm it just in case.<eos> Situation changed; they adapted.
Fire up the radio interference.<eos> Almost ready on my end.<eos> Done.<eos> Our radar's picking up the amplified static!<eos> It's working.<eos> The drones are changing course.<eos> Remember, kid, the first one shoots back!<eos> Yeah, well, I'm shooting first.<eos> We got 'em.<eos> They're falling like stones.
Remember, kid, the first one shoots back!<eos> Yeah, well, I'm shooting first.<eos> We got 'em.<eos> They're falling like stones.<eos> Nice!<eos> Damn it!<eos> Walt, one just got by.<eos> Yeah, one flew right through the beam.<eos> Where do the drug runners get their drones?<eos> Wherever they can.
Damn it!<eos> Walt, one just got by.<eos> Yeah, one flew right through the beam.<eos> Where do the drug runners get their drones?<eos> Wherever they can.<eos> Buy, build, steal.<eos> That's it, that's the last one.<eos> Now, wherever that one came from, it has some kind of tech that makes it immune to our pulse-gun.<eos> Once the bad guys realize that...<eos> They'll get more of that type and will make our weapon moot.
You're not gonna lose me literally or figuratively.<eos> Unless you put tracking software on my cell phone again.<eos> I won't have to break up with you, because you'll be dead.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Just got off the phone.<eos> Sanchez is gonna be okay.<eos> And those drug runners we busted, they flipped on their bosses.<eos> It's gonna shut down their heroin trade for a while.<eos> Eh, bad guys always adapt.<eos> They'll find another way to smuggle the stuff in.
Thank you.<eos> MUNDO: Unlike Alison's fitness band, Ron's was still intact.<eos> I imaged it and sent it back to CTOC.<eos> All right, so Ron said he was hit by a car before he was abducted.<eos> The coroner found the same bruising on Alison's legs and her lower back.<eos> Which means they were both hit by cars.<eos> That would also explain the spike on her wearable data at 8:58 p.m.<eos> Vehicular blitzing.<eos> It's a tactic used by pedophiles.<eos> They hit a kid, helps incapacitate them before abduction.
They hit a kid, helps incapacitate them before abduction.<eos> So, our target is using these fitness wearables to profile, and then stalk and kidnap people in top physical shape, right?<eos> That's surgical tools, a cooler, blood bags, anesthetic machine, heart rate monitor.<eos> Ice in the cooler is still frozen.<eos> We must have scared our target away.<eos> RYAN: Well, we're either dealing with a modern day<eos> Victor Frankenstein, or this is organ harvesting.<eos> RUSSELL: If that's the case, then why did he leave all of Alison's organs behind?<eos> She must have died before he could operate.<eos> You know, there are plenty of organs that are still viable in a body post-mortem, so maybe they were too damaged from the impact of the car.
There are sites on the Deep Web that bring in millions of dollars every year.<eos> Supposedly, over 100,000 people in the U.S. alone are legally waiting for an organ, so some of them must get desperate and go on the Deep Web's Red Market looking for a miracle.<eos> The classic supply doesn't meet demand scenario.<eos> But our target isn't trying to meet demand.<eos> He's very specific about choosing his victims.<eos> Yeah, he's only going after people in the best physical shape.<eos> It's not about quantity, it's about quality.<eos> But organ harvesters don't care about quality.<eos> In the Deep Web, an organ is an organ.<eos> They just find one and sell it to the highest bidder.

Come on. We're not playing games, we found your USB stick.<eos> Since when was it illegal to have one of those?<eos> Just confirmed, this is the exact USB stick that installed the backdoor on Andrew Michaels' computer.<eos> You filed the death certificate, Stella.<eos> Enjoy prison.<eos> Elijah, look at this.<eos> Stella Kaine is a digital assassin for hire.<eos> She's got dossiers on every person she's ever killed.<eos> It's more than 75 people last year alone.<eos> Issuing false death certificates, creating havoc, forcing people to prove they're alive, when a government document says they're not.
You're looking at them. What I'm looking at is a D.A. who's delayed this bail hearing twice.<eos> Now you come into my courtroom without checking the legal status of your witnesses?<eos> Do you have any other evidence to present?<eos> Your Honor, this is a blatant stall.<eos> Ms. Shaw, I can no longer hold<eos> Rafael Pintero in custody, based on the evidence presented today.<eos> Kyle Buckner.<eos> Molly Vance.<eos> Two key witnesses in my case against Rafael Pintero.<eos> They were both murdered just hours after Pintero's release on bail.
Guy belongs in a cage.<eos> I'd like to put him in a cage myself, but Violent Crimes would be the lead on this murder of federal witnesses.<eos> I just came from a meeting with them, they have agents looking for Pintero now, and my third witness, Martin Ward.<eos> When he heard about the murders, he fled.<eos> I begged Martin to testify.<eos> If Pintero finds him and kills him, it's on me.<eos> Why come to Cyber? Because this was a cyber crime.<eos> The only reason Pintero received bail was because someone hacked into the electronic death registration system and digitally killed my witnesses.<eos> Oh, I guess we just found out how digital murder can be used in the real world.<eos> Death certificates trump all other forms of identification, so even though my witnesses were standing in court, legally they weren't.
I mean, the guy's careful.<eos> So we're not actually any closer to catching him.<eos> Well, let's try to use the site as it was intended, to hire him.<eos> Nelson, will you click on the "How it works"?<eos> Yeah. Okay, so it looks like Reaper makes you upload a video of yourself.<eos> You give your name, the name of your intended victim, and an explanation for why you need them dead.<eos> If he takes you on, he responds to your video message and arranges an in-person pick up of his fee.<eos> Okay, now why would someone willingly send a video that incriminates themselves?<eos> Well, Reaper's clients are desperate.<eos> They'll do anything to escape justice.
She prefers to be called Izzy, but Jack can't get used to it, so it's...<eos> Gosh, is everything okay with you two?<eos> 'Cause he seemed a little bit weird today, too.<eos> He was all twitchy.<eos> This doesn't have anything to do with the Alumni Board review, does it?<eos> Well, listen, truth be told... Oh. ...Jack has been snorting an excessive amount of coke lately, so I think that might have something to do with the twitchiness.<eos> Yeah. I guess we're both funny.<eos> Okay. Well, I look forward to steaks.<eos> You should.<eos> They'll be entirely made of cow meat.
Scurvy.<eos> Privation suffered on a migrant's passage perhaps.<eos> Polish.<eos> Prayer card.<eos> It's Mark 3:11.<eos> Curious it is in English.<eos> It said Mark what?<eos> 3:11.<eos> There we are.<eos> "And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him."
I think me and you may yet escape this particular pickle in one piece.<eos> I never had a daughter, you know.<eos> I should have liked one, however.<eos> What benefit do you imagine she might have carried?<eos> Well... no ship's head was ever made from the figure of a man.<eos> [Laughter]<eos> She would have been pleasing to have about the place is all.<eos> Kind words, a pot of coffee.<eos> Sons do not offer such?<eos> They do not.

- Well enough.<eos> Took on Charlie Tanner some 10 years past.<eos> He was a muckscrap, a street run, filching pockets and sucking gin like it was mother's milk.<eos> These ironworks forged a man of him.<eos> And do you often recruit such muckscraps to your foundry?<eos> We take in all sorts at the ironworks, give them purpose, discipline, teach them honest work and temperance.<eos> - Temperance?<eos> - Oh, I insist on it, sir.<eos> None of my boys is weak for grape nor grain.<eos> They live, work, sport as men of iron.

You diagram fastidiously, sir.<eos> Tactics, the inner workings of the game.<eos> My old man was a watchmaker.<eos> Every night, fingers at springs and cogs, assembling and correcting.<eos> Never had the skill for it.<eos> These are anvil hands.<eos> But he tried to school me, he did, my pa.<eos> Taught me about Isaac Newton, who thought the universe entire, one vast clockwork, wound on God's own crankshaft.<eos> And you find this sport, these men to be as cogs?<eos> I merely find they are the best of themselves at work harmonious.
Not like Charlie did.<eos> He was running from you, wasn't he?<eos> And you couldn't stand to see him leave your team.<eos> I made him, here.<eos> He was nothing.<eos> He was the shit on your shoe.<eos> And he would repay me thus?<eos> I made him!<eos> Human beings are not cast metal, Mr. Hackman.<eos> They are not ore to be forged as you wish.
And I know not if I shall ever feel light again.<eos> You wished to see me?<eos> Inspector Reid, when you worked under Fred Abberline, did you presume to question his judgement at every turn?<eos> Mr. Drake, Bennet...<eos> Inspector Drake, I am Inspector Drake.<eos> And when I was your sergeant, did I presume to question your judgement?<eos> You did not, Inspector Drake.<eos> Then with what conceited licence is it you ceaselessly question mine?<eos> My suspicions of Thomas Gower were, I accept, unfounded.<eos> So they were.
They'll look nice in a jug on the windowsill.<eos> Yeah, well, I work hard for my money, girl,<eos> I don't want it wasted on no flowers.<eos> Now make me something to eat.<eos> - Can I fetch you some tea?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> You can sit with me though.<eos> You're worried about Amelia Havisham.<eos> It's so sad.<eos> People can be so cruel, can't they?

If he is the heir apparent to the Cuban presidency, shouldn't Billy handle this?<eos> I'd love to protect the guy.<eos> I mean, Hernandez is the most powerful person in Cuba actively pushing for democracy.<eos> And he's making headway, too.<eos> Well, then what's the problem?<eos> One PP said no, because my dad was a Cuban dissident.<eos> And you might be right about the headway.<eos> Hernandez is here to announce some new open trade policies at the UN.<eos> It doesn't matter what he announces.<eos> Plenty of Cubanos are gonna link him to the Castros, and they're not exactly gonna lay out the welcome mat.
Strepto...<eos> Blood thinner.<eos> So. It's official.<eos> You will be charged with the attempted murder of Carlos Hernandez and the murder of Ernesto Garcia.<eos> We have diplomatic immunity.<eos> You can't charge us with anything.<eos> I'm afraid she's right.<eos> We can't charge you with anything.<eos> However, our new friends, the Cuban government, can.<eos> And they have.
Uh, hi, yeah. Uh, h-hey.<eos> Hey, babe.<eos> I thought you were just going over to say hi. I was, I was, but the... the guys made me stay and help them unpack.<eos> Well, hurry home, and don't forget we're gonna have a baby!<eos> How could I forget?<eos> 'Cause you won't let me. It's the most important thing in my life.<eos> - Oh, I love you.<eos> - Love you, love you.<eos> You know, I was just thinking about...<eos> They about to steal the TV.
What's his name?<eos> Jimmy?<eos> Doing a stretch up in Stateville?<eos> Domestic battery, that's what I heard.<eos> Must be a real tough guy, beating up on his girlfriend like that.<eos> I know a couple dirty white boys who would just kill to have this 10 grand deposited in their canteen account.<eos> One collect call, Jimmy comes back to you feetfirst.<eos> You sign off on this?<eos> Little making death threats?<eos> No. Do the cops know what kind of snake they're in bed with?
Uh-huh.<eos> I don't know if you want to write that down.<eos> Sure, we could establish an alibi.<eos> And create probable cause, that is, if we were interested in doing the bare minimum, but at Sanderson Yao, we go the extra mile.<eos> We are going to solve this case.<eos> 'Cause that's what we do.<eos> We-we don't actually do that.<eos> We don't solve the... solve the case.<eos> No, lawyers don't do that.<eos> Well, maybe they should. I mean, Neal, ask yourself, does a plumber come to your house and just say,
Watch your mouth.<eos> You're wearing his ring too.<eos> Isn't that nice?<eos> Let's have 'em.<eos> Don't give it to him.<eos> She can give 'em to me, or I can just take 'em.<eos> One way, she bleeds.<eos> It's okay, Chin.<eos> Where are your wallets?<eos> They're in the car.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's a story.<eos> But it doesn't matter because I had this amazing dream about how tonight was gonna go and it went the exact opposite.<eos> I knew this was gonna happen, Gabi.<eos> You just put so much pressure on this one date.<eos> No, it wasn't just one date!<eos> It was "the" date, and I wanted it to be perfect.<eos> God, why does everybody always disappoint me?<eos> Because that's life, Gabi.<eos> People disappoint.<eos> They... they don't mean to, but it happens, and you forgive them.
Larry, for Chri...<eos> There's already chocolate inside.<eos> The point is that there's a brightly colored candy shell!<eos> - How about brown? !<eos> - Are you even listening to me? !<eos> Brown isn't fun.<eos> Brown isn't attractive. - Brown?<eos> - Larry, what is wrong with you?<eos> The brown dye people have my kids.<eos> They have my [bleep] kids!
You made this whole big deal about me coming to your place first?<eos> Yes, I'm such a scatterbrain.<eos> I was just hanging out, you know, eating popcorn, catching up with my stories, but I'm gonna take a long shower.<eos> We're gonna take you out.<eos> You like hot dogs?<eos> Yeah, hard pass on that.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> It just feels like you're playing some kind of game.<eos> I don't play games.<eos> They bore me, and I win them too easily.
Yeah, well, someone was in her life.<eos> Looks like, uh, kids.<eos> Maybe nieces.<eos> [knock at door] Officers, is the lady all right?<eos> No. Who are you?<eos> You live here?<eos> Yeah, yeah. I live across the hall.<eos> - Were you around last night?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Actually, I saw two guys try to break in here around 1:00 a.m. They had keys.
You live here?<eos> Yeah, yeah. I live across the hall.<eos> - Were you around last night?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Actually, I saw two guys try to break in here around 1:00 a.m. They had keys.<eos> Was it anybody you ever seen before?<eos> No. Younger than her boyfriends.<eos> - They were Spanish, maybe.<eos> - You call the police?<eos> No, I yelled at them, and they ran away.
What happened?<eos> That poor girl.<eos> I saw the ambulance.<eos> Did you hear anything last night?<eos> There was something going on.<eos> - In the courtyard?<eos> - Yes. I went to the window.<eos> She was out there with some men.<eos> Can you describe them?<eos> They were wearing hoodies.
Ronnie Ellis, Juan Flores, and William Reeves.<eos> Ronnie and Juan are hardcore, but Will...<eos> he surprised me, though.<eos> He's been trying to straighten out.<eos> Aren't they locked in at night?<eos> They're supposed to be.<eos> We've been having issues with the night guards.<eos> And where are they now?<eos> Told them to wait in the game room.<eos> ♪ Looks like they didn't listen.
He's attending classes.<eos> - He's an A student.<eos> - Good for him.<eos> I can offer felony assault or sexual misconduct.<eos> You need my client's testimony.<eos> According to the "Daily News," no one in the victim's apartment building saw anything.<eos> Okay, so which is it?<eos> He was there, he didn't participate, or he wasn't there?<eos> What about his friends?<eos> Won't they have sob stories too?
You also told me that you were out a bar with your boyfriend and Libby just told me that you're in AA and you're single.<eos> Now, that's two lies right there.<eos> You were home that night, weren't you?<eos> - I didn't see anything.<eos> - Yeah, but you were home.<eos> Listen, Doug,<eos> Libby needs your help right now.<eos> These guys... they're gonna get away with this.<eos> Better than having them kill me.<eos> They know where I live.

I know I should have called the police, - but I didn't.<eos> - I... started drinking instead, until I forgot.<eos> I will never forgive myself for that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Before the night in question, when was the last time you'd had a drink, Mr. Nelson?<eos> Almost five years.<eos> Is it possible a relapse like that could've affected your memory?<eos> I know what I saw.<eos> I learned how to function while drunk a long time ago.<eos> Did you ever describe the suspects to the NYPD before they were arrested?
Great, so they have a nine-hour head start, which means they could be anywhere.<eos> You say Rollins understands him better than anybody else?<eos> Get her up here.<eos> This just in on the continuing manhunt for escaped serial killers Greg Yates and Carl Rudnick.<eos> Sources now confirm that two ConElectric workers were found murdered this afternoon just outside Green Haven Correctional.<eos> The workers are believed to have assisted the fugitives in their daring escape earlier today.<eos> The search for the two convicted felons intensifies tonight.<eos> Troopers from four states and law enforcement personnel from several federal agencies have converged on the scene.<eos> Both Yates and Rudnick were serving life sentences for multiple counts of rape and murder.<eos> They should be considered extremely dangerous.
There's a nationwide alert.<eos> They won't get away.<eos> You don't know Yates.<eos> Yates and Rudnick are extremely dangerous.<eos> They've already killed two men who helped them escape.<eos> All right, they've already a head start, so they could be anywhere.<eos> We've warned the public to keep their doors locked and to avoid engaging any strangers.<eos> NYPD's Special Victims Unit is here to give specifics about the fugitives.<eos> Lieutenant Benson? These guys are intelligent.<eos> They're motivated. They're charming, and they are without conscience.
- Little things.<eos> Salt to cook with, spices, organic soaps.<eos> How about hacksaws?<eos> Maybe it's not good for her to be here.<eos> She has a lot of anger toward me.<eos> Yeah, why do you think that is, Bronwyn?<eos> - Liv, we got this.<eos> - No, I'm not gonna coddle her.<eos> You helped two serial killers escape from prison.<eos> Whatever they do to anyone while they're out is on you.
- No, I'm not gonna coddle her.<eos> You helped two serial killers escape from prison.<eos> Whatever they do to anyone while they're out is on you.<eos> Dr. Rudnick has dealt with his dark side.<eos> He chopped a woman into little pieces!<eos> That's not the man that I know.<eos> - Oh, my God. - Okay, Bronwyn.<eos> I'm sure he...<eos> He can be empathic and make you feel wanted, attractive, but he was using you.<eos> They left you to die in the trunk of a car.
Tinklebutton, it's Blake.<eos> I'm ready to join you in a life of crime.<eos> Listen, I know we've had our differences in the past, and I appreciate you coming to get me like this.<eos> I'm sorry for the way that I've tre--<eos> Hey! Where you going?<eos> A life of crime is in that direction.<eos> Crime is wherever I'm at, "big brother."<eos> But I am your big brother.<eos> Where are the other doctors?<eos> They all got a job at some crappy free clinic downtown.
Wouldn't that actually make you a veterinarian?<eos> - Nope. - Well, veterinarian, though, heals --<eos> Doctor.<eos> Just tell me what a veterinarian does.<eos> He fights wars.<eos> Okay, whatever.<eos> You know best.<eos> Fight's off, everybody. Fight's off. (crowd groans)<eos> (laughs) Where are they getting these actors?<eos> They're really top-notch.
You! Come with me, rookie.<eos> This is where it all happens --<eos> Life, death, and everything in between.<eos> You mean like some sort of liminal zone between life and death?<eos> No. Doctors.<eos> Oh, yeah. Watch out for them.<eos> This is your station. Uh-huh.<eos> Don't overdo it on the perfume.<eos> Always keep a needle and thread close, and buy yourself a nice push-up bra.<eos> Mm-hmm. Doctors think they need a nurse, but what they really need is something between a mother and a waist-high hooker with no teeth who has handlebars for ears.
"Dead men tell no tales."<eos> But Bardot wouldn't back down,<eos> - so the cop kills him. - Mm.<eos> What was the name of the trainer that was dealing?<eos> Arthur Stinson, today's not your lucky day.<eos> It's actually the complete opposite of your lucky day.<eos> Look, man.<eos> I don't know what people been telling you, but I don't sell drugs.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> 'Cause that's exactly what they've been telling us.
Excellent idea!<eos> - Do one about...<eos> - Nothing sexual, please.<eos> ...orgasms!<eos> I'm not going to sing about orgasms!<eos> ALL: Come on!<eos> ♪ They feel really nice<eos> ♪ They feel really nice<eos> ♪ I really like orgasms<eos> ♪ They happen down there. ♪
It's all right. I have been here before.<eos> I do know the way.<eos> - What, in there?<eos> - Yes, Ma'am.<eos> Goodness!<eos> - What have I done to deserve this?<eos> - The brief was simple.<eos> Perform minor ceremonial tasks with a minimum of fuss.<eos> Not end up all over the newspapers.<eos> I can't help it if they want to write about me.
The monarchy, yes.<eos> Not the monarch.<eos> - Reparations will need to be made.<eos> - To whom?<eos> To the people you offended.<eos> A general, to whom, when asked if you'd like to dance, you replied, "Yes, but not with you."<eos> I believe there was also a débutante you managed to make cry, and the dancers of Sadler's Wells, whom you refused to meet after arriving late for the performance.<eos> You showed individuality.<eos> And that made people panic.<eos> They don't want individuality.
- Trust me, I've evolved.<eos> - Into what?<eos> Everyone was just getting used to your fluidity.<eos> I'm still fluid.<eos> And I still don't want to label myself.<eos> This summer, I learned that I don't have to...<eos> Can we talk about your suspenseful sexuality later?<eos> I'm casting a new Lisbeth and I need to pick two finalists.<eos> Ladies, please don't chew your pencils.<eos> They're not yours to keep.
Who insures a boat?<eos> I thought the play was life insurance.<eos> What? I took out a very aggressive policy on Jeff.<eos> Damn it, Roger, we can't let them drown!<eos> It's, uh, it's actually a pretty important part of the plan.<eos> The -- the, uh, crux, if you will.<eos> Ugh, forget it. They lived.<eos> That was horrible! The boat just sank!<eos> And the life jackets didn't help at all!<eos> It's like they're filled with sand.
Five years ago, we were hurting for cash.<eos> When Fairbridge offered to buy us, even I thought it was a good idea.<eos> Turns out we let the devil in the door.<eos> Ever since, the school's been aggressively recruiting our residents.<eos> And I'm not allowed to do anything about it.<eos> Um... forgive our ignorance-- my partner and I tend to think of higher education as being a good thing, so what is so bad about people who are trying to turn their lives around going to college?<eos> If they were getting a real education and if there was real financial support for them, I'd be all for it.<eos> But with this, they're flat-out lied to.<eos> Recruiters promise degrees that the school doesn't even offer, and help with job placement that they never give.<eos> They'll say anything to get people to sign on the dotted line.

Not about Hicks being unlucky... but about the killer not staging the five other break-ins.<eos> I don't think what happened here was connected to those.<eos> Look at the last names of all the other families.<eos> They're all Russian.<eos> There's a lot of Russians in this neighborhood.<eos> Yes. But if you exclude Hicks, the crew hit only Russians.<eos> There's a Russian Orthodox church just a few blocks away.<eos> And the night of the break-ins was also the Eve of the Epiphany.<eos> The what?<eos> If the thieves had an association with the church, they would have known which families were attending services that night.

And that apartment and this one can look right into each other.<eos> And according to this, they didn't take very much from that one.<eos> Maybe because they left in a hurry.
What, are you gonna go rough up my mom and Vince now?<eos> I should take you all downtown.<eos> See who turns on who.<eos> I'm calling my attorney.<eos> You don't need a lawyer.<eos> I need more weed.<eos> He's also my dealer.<eos> Thanks for taking me to work.<eos> Well, odds are you're gonna do some more pretty heroic stuff today and then the guys are gonna want to take you out drinking again.<eos> Yeah, they love me.
I think I proved my point.<eos> Sorry!<eos> Are we done here?<eos> Are you done playing big hero?<eos> Look, I was just trying to be a good cop.<eos> I can't help it if people are impressed by that.<eos> What people?<eos> Those idiots at work?<eos> You used to make fun of them.<eos> You said they gave cops a bad name.
That is too bad, 'cause it's gonna be one hell of a show.<eos> And... there we are.<eos> Were you aware that Evan Labelle was having direct communication with Thomas Karume and other high-ranking officers of the LRA?<eos> That's impossible.<eos> Evan devoted years to finding Karume.<eos> (chuckles) Here I thought the show was gonna be on the big screen, but turns out the Oscar gold is right here.<eos> Hmm.<eos> We thought that this was happening behind your back until we found footage of you authorizing transfers to the LRA from the same bank.<eos> Evan asked me to make those transfers.<eos> I had no idea where they were going.
Put down your weapon.<eos> I said... put down your weapon.<eos> Sam!<eos> Agent Callen!<eos> Drop your weapons.<eos> So... you have come to rescue me again.<eos> I never thought this is who you were.<eos> You think these men are with Tahir?<eos> Or Karume.<eos> They rescued me from my brother.
Did they blindfold you or put a hood on you?<eos> It was a hood.<eos> What was wrong with the truck?<eos> What was wrong with the truck?<eos> I worked on the engine.<eos> They overheated it trying to get out of a ditch.<eos> Did they ask him to do anything else to the truck?<eos> Was that the only service you performed?<eos> I got the clay out of the tires.<eos> They were caked in this red clay.
If we want Moussa, they insist we take responsibility for all 243 aboard.<eos> Whoa. Take in refugees from the country that-that harbored the mastermind of a week-old dirty bomb attack?<eos> - Yeah, we're not doing that.<eos> - Why?<eos> POTUS already announced the U.S. would resettle 20,000 Libyans this year.<eos> That was before the bombing, which is bad enough.<eos> Now the president will be labeled<eos> Aider and Comforter in Chief.<eos> Pitch me something else.<eos> Listen, even if we strike intelligence gold, what good will it do if we return these folks to Tripoli and they broadcast what they've seen?
Senator, you know as well as I that only a fraction of the one percent of the nearly one million refugees admitted to the U.S. since 9/11 have ever been arrested on terrorism charges.<eos> It only takes one.<eos> Look at the dirty bomb.<eos> Which was perpetrated by a native-born American citizen.<eos> Good folks in my state know the difference between native-born and real, and I'm wondering if you do.<eos> Morejon... that's a Cuban name, right?<eos> When did your parents arrive in the U.S.?<eos> I'm guessing that you know the answer to that.<eos> Of course I do; I'm the Secretary of State.<eos> They were Marielitos, part of the boatlift of 1980.

And yet, almost every one of them says that if it were possible, they'd stay in Libya.<eos> It's home.<eos> Sit.<eos> Sit.<eos> We were sorry to hear about the op in Libya.<eos> You have our condolences.<eos> It wasn't the outcome anyone had hoped for.<eos> But we still have work.<eos> Now we can transfer the refugees off our ship into Camp Blickstein in New Mexico for processing.<eos> After everything they've been through, these people deserve some stability.
But we still have work.<eos> Now we can transfer the refugees off our ship into Camp Blickstein in New Mexico for processing.<eos> After everything they've been through, these people deserve some stability.<eos> Unfortunately, starting interdepartmental vetting opens them to scrutiny.<eos> And you can believe Senator Morejon will stoke the flames.<eos> Well, even if he passed a bill to block them,<eos> Dalton would veto it.<eos> So we are full steam ahead.<eos> Nadine, make this a priority.<eos> - These people matter, and they're not going back.
Again, it's complicated.<eos> Because you're helping his brother...<eos> Who's a good vampire.<eos> Exactly.<eos> So this good vampire... Does he feed on people, too?<eos> Does he kill them?<eos> Stefan...<eos> I mean, not right now, but...<eos> It's complicated?<eos> The thing is, I've just spent the past few days with you learning about how much you hate vampires and what they did to your town.
Sucks, huh?<eos> I'm fine. I'm fine.<eos> So... Adam and I are both professionals.<eos> It'll be like it never happened.<eos> - Okay. Good. - Yeah.<eos> 'Cause I've seen those women go into a tailspin.<eos> "I'm gonna be alone forever.<eos> My eggs are drying up."<eos> So I am glad you're not worried.<eos> Except they do dry up.
Just... what's the plate?<eos> It's Mary 84512.<eos> That vehicle was downed two weeks ago for maintenance.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> Just drop an anchor.<eos> We're rolling to you.<eos> Always half in the dark with these guys.<eos> I don't know.<eos> They're in the house already.
So I think we should get her out.<eos> And they don't want to.<eos> It eats you up... what we do.<eos> Our bosses don't know what they're doing.<eos> You figured that out, right?<eos> She trusts me.<eos> That's always a problem.<eos> Martha. Get in.<eos> What's going on, Clark?<eos> I think they may know, Martha, about you.
I wouldn't send you out there to see just anyone.<eos> But you know what he has access to right now.<eos> There's always some reason.<eos> There's not just some reason.<eos> If they target our nuclear capacity in a first strike, our people back home will have nothing to defend themselves with but these weapons.<eos> I've been there when we couldn't defend ourselves.<eos> You know what happened.<eos> We can't trust Martha's surveillance reports anymore.<eos> She called in sick.<eos> They could already be suspicious.
I think that was scary.<eos> Uh, chasing spies, uh... it's not, like, car chases and stuff.<eos> It's more like, uh...<eos> There's a lot of figuring out, waiting.<eos> He says being an FBI agent taught him patience.<eos> Okay, we need this cable.<eos> I went to Bauman Technical University.<eos> It's like your MIT.<eos> And I can tell you, we have the best scientists in the world, but we don't have the money, and it's... it's not a good combination.<eos> I'm getting worried, Stan. All those brains, what... what they're doing.

All those brains, what... what they're doing.<eos> Without the right resources, they get their hands on things that they cannot always handle in the right way.
- After this, we're done.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Do you know anything about biological weapons?<eos> Not really.<eos> Your military makes them...<eos> or tests them.<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> Someplace.<eos> I don't know where.<eos> They send some of the work out somewhere else.
Actually, I heard Transformers six times.<eos> This was such a good idea.<eos> I cannot wait to not see this movie with you. I know.<eos> I don't even care what we're not seeing.<eos> Hey, you know what I just realized?<eos> This is our first movie together. I'm gonna remember it forever.<eos> Me too.<eos> Because our parents are making out with each other right there!<eos> We gotta stop them.<eos> No, we can't. If they see us on a date together, we'll look like liars.
Does that sentiment apply to Imperials?<eos> All the Imperials I know.<eos> I'll take that for you, for the climb.<eos> We'll get it when we reach the top.<eos> Time to go.<eos> Hold it.<eos> Don't climb the walls.<eos> Go up the pillars.<eos> Pillars will never hold my weight, never mind yours added on.<eos> They hold up this cave, don't they?
Where?<eos> No, no. Forget it, no time!<eos> Get over there and find that ship.<eos> Do not let him take off!<eos> We'll follow your signal.<eos> No, disobeying me is gonna be dangerous.<eos> Now get going!<eos> How much further?<eos> You worry about your friends?<eos> They need my help.
But I just broke up with my girlfriend.<eos> Right before Valentine's Day?<eos> What an ass.<eos> Please take me back. Our love was meant to be!<eos> I'm gonna all alone on Valentine's Day.<eos> Well, you were right-- tears.<eos> Okay, and we are live in 22 minutes.<eos> I'm nervous. I hope people will be around to watch even though it's Valentine's Day.<eos> People who are fans of an Internet show about flags?<eos> Trust me, they're around.
I have this thing to get to for...<eos> Callie.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'll...<eos> I'll figure it out.<eos> You don't have to worry about this.<eos> Look, I don't know about this Arbiter company, but there are bad apples in privatization.<eos> I mean, that's the point of the bill, is to weed them out with... with regulation and oversight.<eos> Okay, well what does it mean if no one's really being held accountable?<eos> Do you think government employees are held accountable when they screw up?
So I told Brandon.<eos> I know.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> So what the hell is this?<eos> It's, uh, it's... it's the sets from Romeo and Juliet .<eos> I mean, it's cool, right?<eos> I thought you were gonna use the space to skateboard.<eos> Well, I...<eos> I was, I was, but then, um, my friends, they... they, uh, they lost the theater at school,
Do we know that she's the one making these allegations?<eos> She posted the restraining order that we took out against Brandon on the Fost and Found website.<eos> How did she get that?<eos> Honey, it's public record.<eos> This is libel.<eos> It's libel.<eos> We're gonna... we're gonna hire a lawyer and we're gonna sue her ass!<eos> Let's not overreact.<eos> We're not gonna allow this woman to discredit our daughter and then destroy our family with her lies, Lena!<eos> - 'Cause that's what they are!
So it was a suicide mission all along.<eos> Mr. President, Saudi GID just gave us everything they have on the terrorist organization Hizb Al-Shahid.<eos> Including a cell phone intercept, with a recording of Disah's voice.<eos> Alleged voice.<eos> We don't have any recordings of him in our files.<eos> But if it is him, we have a target.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> NSA says the signal originated here, at a compound near Sirte.<eos> I took the liberty to deploy drones, just in case we get confirmation.<eos> And I'll reach out to our NATO allies, see if they have anything.
Tell me where Tyrell is, or shoot me again 'cause the only one it's gonna drive mad is you... not me.<eos> I'm late for my church group.<eos> Peace.<eos> This time targeting the Bank of E network in an elaborate ransomware attack.<eos> The malicious malware targeted the bank's computer servers and spread to multiple branches in North America, encrypting the data and rendering the systems unusable until a ransom was paid.<eos> This more militant variant of the hacker collective forced Scott Knowles, the CTO of E Corp, to burn $5.9 million in public view.<eos> Shortly thereafter pictures surfaced on social media under the name ♪OPdailyallowance.<eos> Now, this is considered a direct response to E Corp's unpopular program, which would lower their daily cash withdrawal allowances for customers to $50.<eos> Some stunt, huh?<eos> Everybody's laughing it off as a dumb prank, but these guys know what they're doing.
I'll bag it, take it back to Tear Down.<eos> See if she'll talk to me there.<eos> All right.<eos> If anybody can make a dead tablet talk, I'm looking at him.<eos> (laughs)<eos> (indistinct chatter)<eos> Severed head, cryptic message... and video of her daughter's last moments?<eos> It's got to be tough.<eos> All right, so the moving company had 36 boxes they were supposed to deliver.<eos> They dropped off 37.

If you or anyone in your crew takes off, that's one way to ensure you get killed.<eos> That will make you look guilty, and we know the Dark Army's blanket rule:<eos> they think the FBI's even snooping around, and it gets ugly.<eos> So just stop being a hard-ass for once, and just let me help you.<eos> How the fuck did this happen?<eos> You seriously asking that?<eos> Do I need to remind you what you did?<eos> They called it the Good Samaritan Law on the account, like, you supposed to be helping people if they're in trouble.<eos> Like it was your duty and whatnot, and if you didn't then you get arrested.<eos> But yo, not only did the homies do jack shit, they also laughed at this fat dude while he was getting mugged, and I ain't gonna lie...
How do I know which one's for me?<eos> Dream.<eos> You got to find out the future you're fighting for.<eos> Sometimes you got to close your eyes and really envision that shit, bro.<eos> If you like it, then it's beautiful.<eos> If you don't?<eos> Then you might as well fade the fuck out right now.<eos> You, me, in Madrid, walking down Calle Atocha, sitting in Café Rollerie having a cortado.<eos> I have some friends who have a vineyard on the coast.<eos> They would love you.
Oh yeah?<eos> Then why do you look so spooked?<eos> Huh?<eos> - Tell Gus I'm taking the truck.<eos> - What?<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - Home.<eos> They say Wyatt took down 77 outlaws with this gun.<eos> And all those outlaws are resurrecting as revenants - coming for us.<eos> They won't rest until they gain freedom from their earthly prison.
- I don't.<eos> - Ouch. - But I might be the one person that can help you.<eos> Thanks, but I'm more of a make-everything-worse kind of gal.<eos> Gonna get worse.<eos> You think the thing that killed Kiersten - is just gonna let you live?<eos> - Not if I'm already gone.<eos> Earp, I know what you know.<eos> OK...<eos> Well, you don't know me, Deputy.<eos> Talk to the locals, they'll tell you.
People in town rave about her.<eos> I told you to leave her out of this!<eos> Clearly, I'm talking to the wrong sister.<eos> Yeah, you're all talking to the wrong sister!<eos> They took the good one into the hills. and slaughtered her!<eos> What was her name?<eos> Willa.<eos> I saw what being law did to my father.<eos> Whatever you've heard... getting deputized's what did him in.<eos> My bosses consider what's happening here in Purgatory urgent, and they will do whatever it takes to protect their interests.
- This is blackmail, you dick!<eos> - This is big government.<eos> You went up against demons twice and you survived.<eos> We want you.<eos> - Get in line.<eos> - So your first job is simple:<eos> identify and eradicate Wyatt Earp's kills.<eos> Revenants.<eos> My daddy always called them revenants.<eos> Before they leave the territory and have the chance to slaughter every man, woman and child in this country.

And you don't think you should wait your turn?<eos> Cyrus has been a great friend to me.<eos> He's also one of the worst human beings on the planet.<eos> That doesn't answer my question.<eos> It does. A good person would wait their turn.<eos> But a Cyrus wouldn't.<eos> A true monster would never wait.<eos> A monster cuts in line.<eos> A monster takes. And you and I both know that this town is run by monsters.<eos> They have the power.
So, you're saying we should actually embrace those that want to tear this country down?<eos> I'm saying if we keep telling certain people they don't belong here, then how can we expect them to not hate us?<eos> I mean, didn't we learn that in preschool, to treat others like we want to be treated?<eos> That's why early education is so important, by the way.<eos> That's why I want to not only support, but expand pre-K programs.<eos> You think the voters are gonna go for that?<eos> I'm making it the bedrock of my campaign.<eos> "Embrace America's Tomorrow."<eos> I'm even announcing my candidacy in my old elementary school.<eos> So they better.
It'll feel good if you let it.<eos> Believing it's real makes it so.<eos> Come on, grab him by the loafers.<eos> Oh, please, gentlemen.<eos> Ankles instead?<eos> The shoes, they're Ferragamo.<eos> The laughing.<eos> It's a lie.<eos> Sometimes lies can be useful, Elliot.<eos> Sometimes they protect you.

We figured once we were actually there, we could get to the present and back to my friends somehow, 'cause that's Fillory.<eos> There's always a way.<eos> There's Jane, and there's us, and someone mysterious watching us, by the way, to follow us through.<eos> Standing in Fillory was the greatest moment of my life, and not just because, as I later found out, the air is .02% opium, which is a pretty unfair trick to get you to love a place,<eos> but, whatever, we loved it.<eos> Oh, uh, oh, so-- if you're a real fan, you totally recognize this from the books-- this iconic scene, right?<eos> Jane falls into a trap and is saved by passing Magicians, but you didn't know is I am in that scene, bitches.<eos> Struggle, struggle. Tighter, tighter.<eos> Okay, do you see them yet?<eos> Nope, but they can't be too hard to miss.
I get to see Adam in a couple of days.<eos> Why don't you tell Kono what happened to, uh, with the eye shadow? Why don't you tell him?<eos> Yeah, go ahead, champ.<eos> Make her feel better.<eos> Is there a crime scene here?<eos> Maid arrived about an hour ago.<eos> Found a woman, Launa Cruz, unresponsive on the bathroom floor.<eos> GSW to the chest.<eos> EMTs detected a faint pulse.<eos> They took her to Kuakini.
You don't have to remind me, okay?<eos> Speaking of which-- will you do me a favor?<eos> Don't let the guys know about my nightmare, okay?<eos> Because if they do, I'm just gonna be a punch line between now and December.<eos> Got it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Chin, it was, uh... very good to see you last night.<eos> So what's the latest?<eos> Mrs. Cruz is in a coma.<eos> Doctors are doing everything they can.
Well, mainly this computer.<eos> Thanks, but nah.<eos> The key to romance is mystery.<eos> The secret to our mystery is right here!<eos> Oh, what is that?<eos> You just got the bullet, my friend.<eos> You wanted to find a connection between Cruz and Foxton?<eos> Well, here it is.<eos> Both men are members of the Makai Country Club.<eos> So they're golfing buddies.
If you drop the independent inspections, they will settle.<eos> Did... did your boss put you up to this?<eos> Look at what's happening.<eos> Who knows if this company will be around long enough to see this case through?<eos> Drop the contingency. You'll get your money.<eos> The inspections are there for a reason.<eos> Do you want what happened to your mom to happen again?<eos> I'll make sure the inspections go forward internally.<eos> Is that how they're suckering you?<eos> Trust me, they value me over there.
I'll be rooting for you, cuz.<eos> Always.<eos> Usually, they feed us.<eos> It's one of the only reasons to come to these meetings.<eos> Should we go ahead and start?<eos> It doesn't look like Susan's gonna make it.<eos> Is there any reason to have this meeting without her?<eos> The economy must really be in the shitter if Susan Jacobs finally decided to take her vacation days.<eos> First order of business is the small independent loan companies we're servicing.<eos> I'm surprised they're not suing us for breach of the uptime clauses.
Well, if this is the part of the conversation where you start throwing out ideas like acid and wood chippers, I ain't obliging.<eos> This isn't a conversation.<eos> We need to do what we always do when we go into full wipe-down mode after a hack.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> You know you screwed me last time?<eos> You let all the dogs go.<eos> I almost got fired.<eos> What was that all about anyway?<eos> Not like it matters.<eos> They all ended up back here.
Hurry up.<eos> I hacked my Dark Army contact.<eos> Found an archive with screenshots of his IRC chats with them.<eos> Something called Stage 2.<eos> It has to do with the femtocell.<eos> I tried to tell Trenton and Mobley, but I couldn't get in touch with either of them.<eos> I called, message checked all the usual haunts.<eos> Both are AWOL.<eos> Okay, Trenton's parents are a wreck.<eos> They filed a missing person's report.
To this day, I still ask that question.<eos> And the answer is still yes.<eos> In every room in the entire world, the answer is yes...<eos> With the exception of one.<eos> Or two.<eos> And that drives me.<eos> I intend to leave a legacy, the standard of which was set by God when he created the Earth and man after his own image.<eos> Anything less is... not worth mentioning.<eos> I'm still against this.<eos> The feds see us with him, no telling what conclusion they'll draw.
We should seriously consider pooling our money together.<eos> It's probably going to be on the market soon.<eos> So what happened here exactly?<eos> I was told it had something to do with the D.C. activists.<eos> Teabaggers, yeah.<eos> They were found two days ago in Maryland.<eos> A car chase ensued.<eos> Ended badly.<eos> One got away; the rest were apprehended.<eos> This is where they were supposed to meet.
It was him.<eos> It's always been him.<eos> When I was five, our parents took us to Coney Island, my dad's idea of an Alderson family outing.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Making a high-powered antenna.<eos> I need to piggyback off someone else's wifi.<eos> I remember looking up at this roller coaster thinking it was the highest thing I had ever seen.<eos> Of course, I wasn't tall enough to go on it, so my dad went with Elliot, and I had to wait with my mom.<eos> I don't remember exactly what happened next, but somehow I got lost.<eos> You know, most kids get scared shitless when they're alone, but I wasn't.
I have money stashed at a hackerspace on Canal.<eos> We wipe your place down, and then we bolt.<eos> We can target them from afar for more intel on Trenton and Mobley.<eos> Darlene, you know we can't leave.<eos> They don't own us.<eos> We played by their rules, and those fuckers still hit Trenton and Mobley.<eos> I am so sick of always worry about switching cabs and phones and trains and always looking behind...<eos> Just calm down, okay?<eos> He was waiting here?<eos> Yeah, they were...

Toto! There's nothing here.<eos> - Or here. - Toto.<eos> Looking for me?<eos> I see you picked up a few strays while I was gone.<eos> Watch it, Zelena.<eos> You really want to mess with us again?<eos> You know you're not welcome in Oz anymore.<eos> You think I want to be in this emerald-tinted dump?<eos> I was banished here by your friends.<eos> I'm sure they had good reason.
Thanks.<eos> Where's Regina?<eos> Uh, condensed version?<eos> Zelena and Hades are on the verge of being the world's worst power couple.<eos> Regina's taking care of it.<eos> I should go.<eos> She's gonna need my help. No, no. It's okay.<eos> Make sure your daughter is safe. Regina can handle her sister.<eos> Siblings.<eos> They can be a real pain, can't they?
It is for me, really.<eos> Please?<eos> Can't we just put this behind us?<eos> We'll give it a try.<eos> That's your solution?<eos> Yes.<eos> A free wedding.<eos> What's the catch?<eos> Look, The Marbella can't afford the bad press if you cancel.<eos> Plus, your friends will stay, they'll have a great time, and they'll come back, which is good for us in the long run.
That's Classroom A dead ahead.<eos> You sure?<eos> If this is a classroom, why are there cryopods?<eos> Someone's making kidcicles.<eos> What kind of school is this?<eos> - The exclusive kind.<eos> - Stand down.<eos> And I don't recall enrolling you.<eos> Did you touch the pods?<eos> Seyah, they're empty.
If he's such a Boy Scout, what's he doing hanging out with a death row felon like Wattana?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We reached out to his family, let them know that he's been found.<eos> Maybe they can fill in some of the blanks until he's well enough to talk to us.<eos> I just hung up with the Coast Guard.<eos> They have nothing.<eos> No distress calls, no shipwrecks within the last 72 hours.<eos> Okay, so where did these guys come from?<eos> Well, let's break this down.<eos> We know they had a gun.

Both men had extremely high levels of mercury in their systems.<eos> Their vitamin D levels were so low that the lab said it looked like they hadn't seen the sun in years.<eos> And both sets of lungs also had evidence of poisoning from diesel fumes.<eos> So I'm thinking, whatever boat they were on, they were on it for a very long time.<eos> They were below deck or working at night.<eos> Right? That would explain the vitamin D deficiency.<eos> It would also explain why they were breathing diesel fumes from the ship's engine room.<eos> And if the only thing you're eating, day in, day out, is fish, yeah, you could definitely get mercury poisoning.<eos> So these guys were fishermen.<eos> Yeah, but the kind of working conditions they were in...

You had a pretty big haul the other day, boss.<eos> What can I say?<eos> Demand is high right now.<eos> So let's strike while the iron's hot.<eos> It's what this is all about, right?<eos> Look, you want to make money or not?<eos> It's risky.<eos> Don't know if the juice is worth the squeeze.<eos> You don't have to worry about those men you lost.<eos> News said they washed up dead yesterday.
Wait, what?<eos> Stop, stop.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> _<eos> Yeah. Okay, I understand.<eos> Hey. Hey, what's going on?<eos> The babies are fine.<eos> Uh, there was some bleeding.<eos> I got scared.<eos> But they're... they're okay?
Whole thing's a joke.<eos> I swear to God...<eos> No, I looked it up.<eos> It's only one meeting a month.<eos> Lots of aldermen have full-time jobs...<eos> Businessmen, cops.<eos> Hey, salary's about 100 grand a year.<eos> How much?<eos> I am dead serious, okay?<eos> Aldermen... they get to vote on where contracts go, what laws get passed.
I'll bring doughnuts."<eos> Couldn't hurt to hear her out.<eos> Oh, you're gonna get killed!<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> What?<eos> You can't look that good in front of people.<eos> Come on.<eos> Yeah, see? That's more like it.<eos> - Okay? - Are you sure this is cool?<eos> These guys, Antonio, they think you're gonna get destroyed.
It's called "wrongful life and battery."<eos> Hospital counsel will get in touch tomorrow morning.<eos> Am I suspended? No.<eos> Not that I'm not tempted, but the hospital can't allow even a hint of possible wrongdoing.<eos> So you will continue working, and we will support you, but depending on how this goes the board may well decide to terminate you.<eos> I don't understand what happened.<eos> He came here to die.<eos> Really?<eos> People do that sometimes.<eos> They sense they're at the end and they just want to die in a clean bed.
No, he'll be dead long before they get here.<eos> Put that away.<eos> Then you shoot me, and he goes over.<eos> - Stop. - No, no, no.<eos> Stop.<eos> This is it.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Gillian Hale was a nursing student, but what she really wanted to be was a surgeon, a helper.<eos> Do you know who suffers the most?<eos> Helpers, because right up until that moment when you snap their neck, they really believe in the goodness of people.
Winston.<eos> You have to help me with this.<eos> Sam is the only one who can drop this charge.<eos> But the magic of a restraining order is that you can't talk to him.<eos> And that... that is human drama.<eos> Tasteful, hip...<eos> I mean, nothing matches, yet nothing is random.<eos> That's just a framed toupee on the wall and it friggin' works.<eos> What are these bartenders wearing?<eos> They look like Civil War surgeons.
Clear.<eos> Valuables are untouched.<eos> This wasn't a robbery.<eos> It was an execution.<eos> Vic's name is Mark Walker.<eos> Looks like he was heading to Los Angeles.<eos> And he was planning on taking Neil with him.<eos> One way tickets purchased this morning.<eos> These guys were in a hurry to get out of town.<eos> Yeah, but who were they running from?
Hirsch, what are you doing?<eos> What-what is this?<eos> Well, since you took away my livelihood, I've had to adapt.<eos> After seeing how busy you all were,<eos> I figured I should, uh, feed off the teat, as they say.<eos> Thanks for that image.<eos> Charming. Mm.<eos> I see you've been in business since '82, huh?<eos> There's nothing wrong with a little white lie.<eos> My customers like to feel that they're in experienced hands.
Safety deposit boxes were all untouched.<eos> They literally walked in, hit the emergency release, and walked right out the door.<eos> Who breaks into a vault to get inside a bank?<eos> As crazy as it sounds, it does make sense.<eos> See, our security office is right outside the vault.<eos> From there, you can shut down the bank's entire alarm system without tripping any surveillance cameras or motion sensors.<eos> Yeah, all right, Mr. Fuller, we're gonna need to see all the, uh, security footage, please.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> The thieves deleted it.<eos> Right. Well, do either of you have any idea what they were after?
Uh, no, what he means is-- that's it, there's nothing more to say.<eos> Then why don't you say that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I, uh... I don't know, you're right.<eos> Neil, you're right, and-and I... and from now on, I will say that.<eos> But right now, we need to ask you about the guys who have been coming here every night.<eos> I'm not supposed to talk about it.<eos> Yeah, I know, I know, but, you see, the thing is we really need you to.<eos> Neil, we think those are the same men who killed Mark.<eos> We need to find them before they hurt someone else.
Then why don't you say that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I, uh...

It's okay. I would have done the same thing if it had been you.<eos> I know.<eos> You did the right thing, okay?<eos> And I promise I would have done the same thing. It's okay, Ma, come here.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you too.<eos> Okay, one more time, Mr. Fuller--<eos> Who were you laundering the money for?<eos> Okay, when you were planning your little getaway, our techs did some digging into the bank security system.<eos> You know, they found out, apparently, you were telling the truth about the surveillance video being scrubbed.
This is a brown mark on a white guy.<eos> Now, that's just lazy.<eos> Hey, Didi!<eos> Did you see this?<eos> A bunch of gunmen killed six Chinese cops steal some old statues, put the dead cops back in the plane and torched the thing.<eos> Carter, why are you reading the airport case file when you are not allowed to go anywhere near a case?<eos> - I like to read.<eos> - Yeah, right.<eos> Also, see those two, very, very white guys?<eos> I guarantee they're here about this.

- I can do this alone.<eos> Okay, you wanna work alone, yeah.<eos> But I'm sure you'll be fine, I mean, you know the city pretty well, right?<eos> Yes, Gerald is a low-life criminal.<eos> But he gives me information that helps me take down real criminals.<eos> I do not like this.<eos> Whoever did this is stone-cold.<eos> Yes, this is a big job and they did it fast.<eos> Perps got on to the runway by knocking out the security guard and locking him in his trunk.<eos> At the hospital, the guard said they looked like legit LAPD officers.
They almost killed me.<eos> Yeah, but they didn't.<eos> And only thing of value that you have in is your flat screen.<eos> And I'm seriously considering having my cousin Gerald come by later to steal it, now talk!<eos> - Oh-ho! - Oh, come on, man!<eos> I didn't mean for that to happen.<eos> These men were from Hong Kong like me, weren't they?<eos> Did any of them have this mark?<eos> They're Quantou, you're a loose end.<eos> They will find you and they will kill you.

Do you know where I can find a noodle pla...<eos> You just gonna keep on walkin'...<eos> I oughta knock you ass...<eos> Man, what's wrong with these people?<eos> You're in my town now.<eos> Hey, do you know where I could find a inside-out rabbit?<eos> Look at that.<eos> - Carter.<eos> - Hey, what's up?<eos> They're torn between their two favorite noodle stores.
- What do they look like?<eos> - Okay. - Be careful not to touch them.<eos> The value of the statues is greater than you can comprehend.<eos> I respect that.<eos> - There goes blondie.<eos> - I don't see Kim.<eos> That might be bad.<eos> Why aren't they shootin' at us?<eos> Even men of character this low won't risk damaging the statues.<eos> They won't use guns.
I mean, who is this guy, anyway?<eos> Is he some drug dealer that you pissed off?<eos> Is he a spy or something?<eos> Not sure he's an NCIS interest.<eos> What is he doing back there?<eos> Douglas?<eos> Douglas... listen to me-- you need to let me do the talking.<eos> Oh, see, there you go selling me short again, Dwayne.<eos> People like talking to me.<eos> They tell me a lot of things.
Angela Goodwin.<eos> Priors include possession and solicitation.<eos> You're stepping it up to conspiracy, kidnapping, assault with a deadly weapon, murder?<eos> He said it was a joke.<eos> Who?<eos> The guy who paid me $500 to flirt with the mayor and get him alone.<eos> Getting the mayor alone.<eos> That didn't strike you as strange?<eos> I've spent time with politicians and their friends.<eos> They do strange things.
Wait, Garfield lives here?<eos> Audra, this is Max and Caroline.<eos> You know, I rarely say this to a lady, but... oh, put a baby in me.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> You think... you don't... okay.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I'm sorry, I'm just conferring with my spirit guides.<eos> Well, if you all talk at once, I can't understand you.<eos> Got it.<eos> They're telling me that someone here just had their heart broken.
They're telling me that someone here just had their heart broken.<eos> It's you.<eos> Oh, my God, Max.<eos> Come closer to me.<eos> Come over here.<eos> Oh, gosh, thanks a lot.<eos> You're bogarting my witch.<eos> These spirits don't lie.<eos> A little too honest sometimes.<eos> I mean, I didn't ask them if they like my bangs, but they sure told me.
You're bogarting my witch.<eos> These spirits don't lie.<eos> A little too honest sometimes.<eos> I mean, I didn't ask them if they like my bangs, but they sure told me.<eos> It was a whole thing.<eos> You don't need to help me.<eos> I'll get over the Randy thing.<eos> I've been through worse things, like this right now.<eos> No.<eos> They're insisting that I help you.
that triggered the threats.<eos> People who send those kinds of messages aren't particularly discerning in their judgments.<eos> "GMO-trocity"?<eos> The person you're looking for used that exact term?<eos> Multiple times a message.<eos> Yes, I received similar threats.<eos> Dozens a week.<eos> Actually, our security people are looking into it.<eos> I'll call them.<eos> I hope by now they've managed to locate the sender.
I have a network of people at my fingertips.<eos> I am a social media god.<eos> You helping Gabi?<eos> I never thought I'd see the day.<eos> Think about it.<eos> If Gabi's truck is a huge success, she won't have time to work for Josh.<eos> I'm turning two weeks into forever!<eos> (Phone beeps) Oh my God.<eos> It's happening.<eos> I contacted every media outlet and now they want her on Rachael Ray!
We can't be married.<eos> We don't know each other.<eos> I mean, you said last night, you didn't remember me.<eos> I didn't until we spent the whole night looking at our old yearbooks and started reminiscing.<eos> All the feelings came flooding back.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> How about the bad feelings from when you hated me for what I did to you?<eos> Did those come back? Where are the bad feelings?<eos> Where are the bad feelings?<eos> They're gone because you made the greatest amends of all.
Drone images show it crashed into Westhole prison.<eos> Took out a wall in the Blue Unit.<eos> Cut out all communications.<eos> Blue Unit?<eos> Where we keep our most dangerous political prisoners.<eos> We can't have the enemies of the Company running free.<eos> My job is to extinguish the Old Town rebellion, not feed it.<eos> Why not just send in Company Officers?<eos> Oh, I did, twice.<eos> They were very rudely shot down at sight.
But he's a hero to these guys.<eos> Look, I'll do the talking.<eos> You guys scan for this Aridity thing.<eos> What Aridity thing?<eos> Dusty!<eos> That Aridity thing.<eos> That's what we do to Company pigs.<eos> Look. We're Killjoys.<eos> We're here to talk.<eos> They're with me, Tighmon.
You're only down by two.<eos> You make a shot on one foot, you're up by five.<eos> No, I'm screwed.<eos> We all are.<eos> But...<eos> I thought things were going great.<eos> You had that meeting yesterday where you said, "things are going great."<eos> Oh, it's all a show, Heck.<eos> I can't tell the people out there the truth.<eos> They have mortgages and car payments.

Huh?<eos> !<eos> And now some kid in Missouri has found a toe in his ringdoodle.<eos> I mean, a finger, I could understand, but a toe?<eos> What are these people doing down there?<eos> Oh, look at this.<eos> Now my eye's twitching.<eos> Is this noticeable?<eos> People are depending on me.<eos> They're all depending on me.
My mom said I should apologize for flaking.<eos> She said I should be nicer to my friends 'cause I don't have a lot of options.<eos> My mom said the same thing.<eos> So we're still friends?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Good.<eos> Maybe we should do something that a group of friends does, then.<eos> What do friends do?<eos> I think they get French fries.
- Yeah.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Good.<eos> Maybe we should do something that a group of friends does, then.<eos> What do friends do?<eos> I think they get French fries.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll see you guys at the fry place.<eos> Wait.<eos> I think when they go, they might actually go together.
I'm no longer living in a hotel.<eos> Or staying in my office.<eos> An associate knew of an apartment, so, uh, now you can rest assured, if the children change their minds and agree to see me, they have a place to stay.<eos> There's even a pull-out sofa, I'm told.<eos> You want something?<eos> Oh, I'm going to AA meetings now.<eos> Did I tell you that?<eos> Uh, it's-- it's court-ordered.<eos> Uh, people seem to find the, uh, the exercises therapeutic.<eos> There's one they call, uh, the "inventory."
A secret.<eos> A secret in a marriage is very hard to survive.<eos> You have a better chance if you can find your pleasure together.<eos> You know, meet each other halfway.<eos> Uh, I just- - I don't think that I can do that.<eos> All I'm asking is that you try.<eos> If you're uncomfortable in bare feet, we could always try it in your Vivier pumps.<eos> Or not.<eos> What if I just... touched your knees.<eos> Well, you don't know how perfect they are.
Don't.<eos> It's too-- too weird.<eos> Betty said you wanted to see me?<eos> I, uh, I wanted to talk to you about what happened in the lab this afternoon.<eos> With Mr. and Mrs. Connolly?<eos> With you, actually.<eos> There is-- there is a real danger in this work, observing a couple in their most intimate moments.<eos> Uh, it's only natural that the observers can, from time to time, find themselves experiencing a certain... erotic charge of their own.<eos> I see.<eos> Uh, if they're not careful, they can begin to mistake the intimacy of the couple behind the glass for a kind of intimacy between themselves and their partner.
You don't have to do anything.<eos> But I have to take care of myself.<eos> No, no, no. Honey, wait.<eos> I understand that you're upset with me, but...<eos> I took your advice.<eos> I saw a psychiatrist.<eos> - You did?<eos> - Yes.<eos> What did he say?<eos> He said, for the most part, that... people are doing the best that they can.

That is what I'm doing.
Yes, you can, and you will.<eos> You want your bail money that bad?<eos> Did you call security?<eos> - Ow! - Do you think a security guard is gonna show up and ask to see my license and give me my money?<eos> Damn it.<eos> All they're gonna see is two moron criminals on government property asking to get shot.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> Look, I'm sure that your parents had reasons they gave you up, okay?<eos> But you finding out, what good is that gonna do you?<eos> They would want you to focus on what you've got now.
Unless this isn't her spell.<eos> He wants us trapped in here.<eos> It's open now, but it won't stay open much longer... 15 minutes tops.<eos> They should've been here by now.<eos> I don't know what's keeping them, but we can't wait.<eos> Zelena, we don't have time.<eos> I can't leave my sister here.<eos> We've done everything we can for your friends.<eos> They're heroes.<eos> They'll get here in time.
I didn't hear a shot.<eos> It's not a shot.<eos> Glass from the window.<eos> I'm so sorry. I didn't...<eos> An ambulance.<eos> You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be fine.<eos> It's not an ambulance.<eos> That's the cops.<eos> Don't get caught here.<eos> They'll be able to help you.
- I realize what it is.<eos> - What what is?<eos> The Foil. The new Chumhum tablet.<eos> Their big contribution to the gadget market.<eos> Comes out in two months.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Someone just left it there?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So I tweeted a picture of it.<eos> Next thing I know, two different tech blogs are calling me so they can be the first to review it.
I so much as raise my voice, I'll hand you my shield.<eos> A social worker cop-- a woman of many talents.<eos> A drug-dealing florist-- could say the same about you.<eos> That last batch you manufactured...<eos> You still got that Percy temper, don't you?<eos> My five-year-old's got one.<eos> Scary.<eos> It reminds me of you sometimes.<eos> Sit down. Sit.<eos> The manufacturers messed up, they left it full of toluene.
An RPG could do it if fired from the right location, but it'd have to be a hell of a dead shot.<eos> Here.<eos> On the other side of the island.<eos> There's nothing there but beach.<eos> It came from the water.<eos> Takehaya has a ship strong enough to take out a UAV?<eos> Cover! Take cover!<eos> Who are these guys? !<eos> Chinese Secret Service!<eos> What the hell are they doing here?
I got eight approaching from the left flank!<eos> You picked a hell of a vacation spot!<eos> Nice timing, Nomad.<eos> How's it look out there?<eos> Trying to clear you a path to the north.<eos> Check your nine o'clock!<eos> I'm coming around.<eos> Bad news, Vulture Team.<eos> You got more hostiles approaching your whiskey... a lot of them!<eos> They're using the trees for cover!
How do you like yours, Roger?<eos> Wow, this is cool.<eos> Dad, you think I could be in the C.I.A. someday?<eos> I don't know, son.<eos> The C.I.A. is all about guys who can do stuff like this.<eos> Whoa, that was awesome!<eos> Jim is an old friend.<eos> It's Carl.<eos> You see what those jackoffs did?<eos> They've blocked my view!
The city bylaws.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, I'm gonna go down to city hall and talk to the head of the records department.<eos> And then we'll see about your little "theory."<eos> You're lucky, Haole.<eos> This isn't over.<eos> Whoa! Thanks!<eos> Yeah, no problem, man.<eos> Don't worry about those guys.<eos> They just don't like outsiders.

He's not allowed to drive 'cause the state's a bunch of assholes.<eos> Yeah, do your thing.<eos> That worked?<eos> Go, Steve, don't question it.<eos> Just go.<eos> Oh, hey, Stan, good news.<eos> We've been approved for a liquor license for the World Cup.<eos> We can sell beer, wine, and soju.<eos> We can make soju cocktails.<eos> They taste like normal cocktails except they suck and they taste like nail polish.
We're going to Florida, and you're coming with us.<eos> Mahalo, Deputy D.<eos> Stow that surf shit, Smith!<eos> We caught the hacker, so I'm bringing you in.<eos> You're back at your desk tomorrow.<eos> What? !<eos> Turns out "Point Break" wasn't the clue.<eos> It was just the movie that was on when I was super high.<eos> But now that I'm medium high, I realize it was ridiculous to suspect those surfers at all.<eos> Okay, they may not be hackers... but I have a hunch they're up to something.
Any more than that, and it's too much!<eos> Well, I-I-I wanna bring them in as much as anyone.<eos> But can it be after I surf a little bit more?<eos> We're gonna go to Florida and surf the wave that goes out!<eos> It's called Firestone Beach, but the locals call it Shady Cove.<eos> And I wanna go there and surf with them!<eos> They're my best friends!<eos> Best friends?<eos> One -- that hurts my feelings.<eos> Two -- the fact that they are your best friends makes me hate them even more!
Best friends?<eos> One -- that hurts my feelings.<eos> Two -- the fact that they are your best friends makes me hate them even more!<eos> Bring them in immediately!<eos> But, sir -- Just go!<eos> I don't want you to see me cry.<eos> Drive, drive, drive!<eos> Those low-key surfers have kidnapped my best friend.<eos> But where?<eos> Where are they taking him? !
Stan's in the C.I.A. and framed us for a crime.<eos> His boss will kill us if he, like, finds us, which means we're not going to surf the wave that goes out.<eos> Cool.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> Righteous.<eos> I'm sorry you guys aren't gonna be able to surf that wave.<eos> Do you guys think the stars have waves?<eos> I bet they do, man.<eos> I bet there's even aliens that surf those star waves.<eos> They probably even have a space surfer magazine.
I was worrying about my family, and that stressed me out, so I tried to get away from them.<eos> But I just started worrying about you guys.<eos> Turns out if I love someone, I worry about them.<eos> And if someone's gonna stress me out, I'd rather it be my family than you guys.<eos> Did Stan just say he loves us?<eos> He did, Gorney.<eos> He did.<eos> I robbed the bank. It was me.<eos> I did it because I wanted to keep hanging out with my friends.<eos> They're not your friends!
Can we please get something to eat?<eos> Of course!<eos> We both share a love of eating!<eos> So, what can I get you?<eos> I'll have a large spaghetti.<eos> They, uh, they don't have that.<eos> Okay, I'll have a medium spaghetti.<eos> Look, how about I get you my favorite snack -- a ballpark frank?<eos> I hate hot dogs.<eos> They remind me of uncircumcised penises.
If you weren't here with your family, where were you?<eos> You know, when the blast happened?<eos> On a mission.<eos> South America.<eos> That's a long walk.<eos> You run into the Two Hundred out there?<eos> I hear they're brutal.<eos> No, but I've seen what they've done.<eos> Cool.<eos> Hey, you, uh, seems like a lot of people are doing that thing where they eat other people.
But also maybe understandable, hmm?<eos> You, uh, done any of that?<eos> Nope.<eos> Me neither!<eos> You passed my test!<eos> Now I feel like I can relax.<eos> Look out!<eos> I thought I saw a murderous road bandit, but it was just a moth.<eos> So tell me, what's your feeling about tattoos?<eos> They should be covered in the workplace.
Talk quieter.<eos> You're scaring the fish.<eos> - It's just rare that...<eos> - Quieter.<eos> - It's so rare...<eos> - Too quiet!<eos> It sounds like you're conspiring against the fish.<eos> You're making them paranoid!<eos> I was saying we never spend any time together!<eos> Well, they're definitely gone now!
My father...<eos> Aside from wanting to kill Hank, wants me to... wants me to change their last name.<eos> Says anyone who Googles them for the rest of their lives will know their<eos> father is a pedophile.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> My mother, she's blaming me.<eos> "How could you not suspect him?<eos> You do this for a living."<eos> Pippa... men who do this have to hide it.<eos> They get very good at compartmentalizing.
Now, this is cell block 24, which just so happens to be one of the closest cells to the duty officer's post.<eos> Unfortunately, Vlad was unable to confirm the presence of CIA officer Sharov, aka Balinski.<eos> So it still could be a trap.<eos> Well... Maybe there is no Sharov.<eos> Or maybe the real Sharov is long dead and they're using Arkady to lure us into rescuing a ghost.<eos> I mean, can you imagine the political implications if two American agents are caught breaking into a Russian prison?<eos> Yes, I can.<eos> This is a well-fortified and protected Russian penitentiary.<eos> Breaking into it is gonna put our team at great risk.<eos> And even if they did get in undetected, there's no guarantee they could get back out.
Russia?<eos> I know it's not easy.<eos> It's the only way.<eos> Okay. And how soon before you come?<eos> I won't.<eos> I can't.<eos> Not even to visit?<eos> No.<eos> My parents.<eos> They'll wonder w-what happened.
She's so strong.<eos> As soon as a teenager complains:<eos> "No one understands, I hate my parents", new friends get in touch and pretend to sympathise:<eos> "Same here."<eos> Day after day, more and more of them sympathize.<eos> Like in a cult.<eos> Saying it's normal, they've been chosen.<eos> But she's got a good brain.<eos> She's not the type.<eos> They speak to her heart, her frustrations, not to her intelligence.
He ran a card game out of a bookmobile?<eos> I did.<eos> He's dead.<eos> CABE:<eos> Anyway, 15 years ago,<eos> Mick makes his way out to Los Angeles.<eos> Was gettin' too hot in New York.<eos> But it's hotter in L.A.<eos> He means the cops were onto him.<eos> And they eventually caught me, even out here, but luckily, Cabe stepped up.
What else did you hear?<eos> Payday: $5 million.<eos> Whoever wants this shipped to Balio wants it bad.<eos> WALTER:<eos> What could we do?<eos> It's not like we can just walk into a criminal enterprise and start looking around.<eos> Why not?<eos> Import/export businesses are software dependent-- setting up shipping rates, docking schedules, customs...<eos> If Grady trusts you, just tell him you know a company that can streamline his system.<eos> Yeah, and once my guys are in, they can look around for any evidence of a bioweapon, and if so, when and how it was shipped.
So we quickly go in, search his hard drive, see if we can find some shipping data that supports Mick's story.<eos> Now, if we do, we call the authorities, and if we don't... too bad for Mick.<eos> We're out.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Once Mick gives us the okay, you're gonna have to play it cool in there.<eos> We're posing as computer techs.<eos> I think we can handle it.<eos> I'm sure we can outsmart some thugs.<eos> Don't underestimate thugs.<eos> I once slipped some dice into a crap game that may or may not have been loaded, and now these three fingers don't bend the way they used to.
PAIGE:<eos> Walter, what is going on?<eos> They won't talk until they know it's safe.<eos> Or else they risk giving away they've got comms in.<eos> (engine revs, tires screech)<eos> (car horn honks)<eos> What the hell did you just do? !<eos> Nothing!<eos> I told Grady's guys they were cool.<eos> They said send them in.
Sorry about the black ops.<eos> I've got millions in cars here.<eos> Best to keep the location under wraps.<eos> That's logical.<eos> We understand.<eos> Mick says you can upgrade my system?<eos> Get my cars in and out of the country faster?<eos> (engine roaring in distance)<eos> From the sound of it, your cars are already moving pretty fast.<eos> Yeah, well, my boys, they gotta test out their handiwork, no?
So far, the odds are low.<eos> Basic search is turning up nothing.<eos> I'll still keep looking.<eos> You know, my Bronx bookie, Albino Pete, he kept his bets on the backs of candy wrappers, hidden in the seat of his daughter's tricycle.<eos> Another winner.<eos> Well, my point is that there's a chance Shady Grady keeps all his records non-digital as well.<eos> Happy and I should poke around.<eos> CABE:<eos> Be careful!<eos> These guys catch you sticking your nose where it doesn't belong, they cut it off.

Yeah, we're car nuts.<eos> Look around.<eos> If you have a million five, feel free to pick up a starter model.<eos> Oh, speaking of the value of these cars,<eos> I have to say, letting your employees drag race them is quite irresponsible.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> It's not like any of these guys are gonna win Le Mans.<eos> I don't let them drive the eight-figure models.<eos> And my guys are good drivers.<eos> I'm sure they're competent, but, see, we're scientists.
Yes, that whole string is a common cold virus, but that C-C-T runner in the middle, that's a mitochondrial gene, unique to people of Mesoamerican descent.<eos> Like Aztecs found in Balio?<eos> TOBY:<eos> Yes, exactly like the Aztecs in Balio.<eos> This weapon is designed to spread via the common cold while attacking a specific gene that's only found in that particular race of people.<eos> That's how the Balio regime can take out their indigenous people without endangering the rest of the population.<eos> They're smuggling a genocide bomb.<eos> Told you I was telling you the truth.<eos> And low-end smugglers are okay with mass death?<eos> Oh, with these guys, once they heard $5 million, all they saw was sandy beaches and rum drinks.
Forget the records.<eos> Just get out.<eos> Okay, I found it.<eos> Grady rented a refrigerated locker by the airport.<eos> It's 225 Box Car Avenue, locker 17.<eos> (gun cocks) MAN:<eos> What the hell?<eos> !<eos> Patrick, these guys are going through our papers.<eos> They're LEOs.
Uh, this is it.<eos> Exactly as advertised.<eos> Second floor, far left.<eos> CABE:<eos> And there she is, pacing like crazy.<eos> She's waiting for her man.<eos> Yeah, well, she's not the only one waiting for her man.<eos> Grady's got two guys in the room right next to her, and Lorraine has no idea.<eos> Oh yeah.<eos> Yeah, well, they'll be waiting for a while.
Here's the forecast for the week.<eos> Monday, we have 82. Tuesday...<eos> Lorraine.<eos> I can't see or hear you.<eos> But I know you can see and hear me.<eos> Cabe.<eos> I think you got her attention.<eos> I know it's been a while since you've seen me.<eos> Mick's in trouble, and so are you.<eos> Grady's got two guys in the room next to you, and they know that you both double-crossed him.

You're gonna find a rope.<eos> I need you to untie the knot and pull it towards you.<eos> And then tie it around the metal brace.<eos> Okay, this is gonna be loud.<eos> They'll hear it, so you're gonna have to move fast.<eos> Stand back.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> Guys, our neighbors heard you.<eos> Get her out the back window before they get in the front door.
Come on!<eos> (pounding on door)<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's go.<eos> (engine revving, tires screeching)<eos> Lorraine, Mick is way over his head on this one.<eos> Now, he didn't steal a car or hold up a craps game.<eos> He's got something that could kill a lot of people.<eos> And if he tries to play games with these buyers, they'll kill him.
When you ran into this room, even though we all suspected it would be booby-trapped.<eos> And then when you pulled that lever, you didn't even hesitate.<eos> Same way you didn't hesitate when Simon pulled the trigger.<eos> You weren't afraid, and not because you're a "minister" with faith, but because you are a mastermind with the knowledge that the gun was rigged to fire backwards.<eos> Not like this one.<eos> Let's finish the experiment.<eos> One of you has to die.<eos> Those are the rules.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> That's the same question I asked my parents when they would rip me away from my twin sister...
It's from an organization called Save the West Side.<eos> We had an incident outside on the street.<eos> Save the West Side was protesting, and their leader hit one of my employees with a picket sign.<eos> Charges weren't pressed, but after that, we just sent everything we ever got from them to security.<eos> "Your building is a modernist nightmare."<eos> Mmm. "A blight that must be stopped at all costs."<eos> You didn't think threats from a violent protestor merited mention?<eos> Honestly, I forgot about it.<eos> Run-ins with neighborhood groups always come up during a project like this.<eos> They just don't want another Starbucks on their corner.
guy's tough as nails.<eos> Something ain't right.<eos> Okay, you see those sparks right there?<eos> He could have killed everyone inside.<eos> The atmosphere inside any decompression chamber is extremely dry.<eos> Start a fire, it's all over.<eos> Give me the details on the chamber.<eos> Pressurized to match the divers' working conditions, which, in this case, is 622 feet below sea level.<eos> Divers live, eat, sleep in the chamber.<eos> When it's time to go to work, they attach to this diving bell, which takes 'em straight down to the ocean floor.

Oh, it's mostly good.<eos> I know when it's gonna rain.<eos> So, PPA's.<eos> Revolutionary idea.<eos> It would eliminate tens of millions in transport costs and change the way we fight wars.<eos> Like having an arsenal standing by.<eos> The Navy would have been very interested in Olympus's technology.<eos> What happened?<eos> The containers don't work.<eos> They leak.

We were about to question him when you guys showed up.<eos> Is there any chance that Dalton could've put that information onto a flash drive?<eos> We're still running diagnostics on his hardware, but, yeah, that's the most likely scenario.<eos> Look, uh, this woman?<eos> She killed three people this morning, trying to get her hands on a flash drive that Dalton was trying to smuggle out of the country.<eos> Too late.<eos> You need to contact your NSA liaison right now and tell them exactly what happened.<eos> This woman, she could be working alone or she could be working for a foreign intelligence service.<eos> Either way, those agents are now compromised.<eos> They need to be pulled out of the field immediately.
Yeah.<eos> If we had secrets that the government didn't want revealed, we could... extort them.<eos> But instead of money, we would demand change.<eos> She said that we would be patriots.<eos> She saw an opening and she-she exploited it.<eos> You understand?<eos> She made you feel like stealing those files was a noble act.<eos> She probably figured she'd just grab them afterwards.<eos> That was never gonna happen, because I told her once we had that information, we had to leave the country.<eos> But they might be onto us, so we had to be careful.
So they kill the already dying?<eos> Exactly.<eos> So technically, they're not killers.<eos> They sort of serve the same purpose in the ecosystem as, like, vultures, providing clean-up and recycling of dead bodies, which, in turn, prevents the spread of plague and pestilence.<eos> They roam in packs called "tristitudo," which translates to "a group of grief."<eos> So we could be dealing with more than one.<eos> Definitely, but the thing is, unlike vultures, these guys don't hang around one area for more than, like, three or four bodies because, you know...<eos> Hauling off a human corpse is a little more obvious than, like, pecking at carrion.<eos> Were the bodies dropped from a high place?<eos> Because they'd have to break the bones before they could dissolve them and suck them out.
Police!<eos> Out of the van!<eos> Guys?<eos> Stop!<eos> Put your hands on your head.<eos> Yeah, Barbatus Ossifrage, we know.<eos> He ran right in front of me.<eos> I... I couldn't stop.<eos> My parents... depend on me.<eos> They're always so hungry.

It's a possibility.<eos> But I'm 40.<eos> I-I can't even have kids much longer.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> What if we could manipulate time?<eos> Xiomara, will you consider freezing your eggs?<eos> Just as an insurance policy, in case.<eos> Uh, I guess I could think about it.<eos> It's all about the eggs.<eos> You have to make sure they're at room temperature.

Then we'll learn how to compromise.<eos> - Rafael, stop...<eos> - Fighting?<eos> I-I can't, 'cause I don't understand, Jane.<eos> We were in love.<eos> We were.<eos> But...<eos> And she knew she couldn't leave the door open.<eos> My feelings changed.<eos> I-I don't know when, but they changed and that's why we aren't together.
But...<eos> And she knew she couldn't leave the door open.<eos> My feelings changed.<eos> I-I don't know when, but they changed and that's why we aren't together.<eos> And strangely, in this moment, his sister's words came to mind.<eos> _<eos> - _ - Sorry I'm late.<eos> Nah, don't worry, Petra's not even here yet.<eos> So, how was the fertility doctor? I learned I have "geriatric eggs."<eos> Seriously. That's what they're called if you're over 35.
See what he knows about this guy.<eos> You know Bobby D'Amico?<eos> Bobby's a friend of the department.<eos> Translation: He bought the brass a lot of Nobu dinners when he was researching his part for Jack Byrnes.<eos> Ah, right, right...<eos> the morally-conflicted D.A. turned bad boy rogue cop?<eos> Bobby's good people.<eos> Anytime there's a benefit for the widows and orphans, he is on that podium.<eos> That's good to know, but for the meantime, why don't we hold off on calling him.<eos> But keep in mind, people look at a celeb, and they see an easy payday.
I got a great nanny, but thanks for asking.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I got a lot of respect.<eos> It just must be tough, being a working mother.<eos> You know what's tough?<eos> Two asshats getting away with rape.<eos> Okay, when there's no case, there's no case.<eos> The victim compromised herself.<eos> Yeah, but they saw her coming.<eos> They got her drunk; they played to her ego, her wild streak, got her to come...
You probably think I have a blind spot because of my sister.<eos> - Right?<eos> - What?<eos> No.<eos> No, not at all.<eos> 'Cause you do know that these two guys are guilty, including your dad's friend Bobby.<eos> You think I'm a daddy's boy.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Right.<eos> Bobby D'Amico is no friend of mine, but until these two get caught in the act, they're gonna keep getting away with it.
No.<eos> I said no.<eos> You used yourself as bait?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Dodds said if we didn't catch these two in the act, then they were gonna walk.<eos> Oh, so this was his idea?<eos> And now I have to hear from your father, the Deputy Chief, that two members of my squad went completely rogue on me.<eos> We're here now.<eos> This is pretty damning video.<eos> Except it's more prejudicial than probative, and they'd already invoked their right to counsel.
To each other.<eos> I just spoke with Nancy and she confessed to it all.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> And I don't know what we should do.<eos> There's only one thing to do.<eos> We can't allow our employees to lie.<eos> We'll have to let them both go.<eos> I'll bring them in here now.<eos> Bill, before you do...<eos> If they lied to us about this, who knows what they're capable of?

Uh, no.<eos> I guess he asked about my dad's rich friends, and then he asked about working for Alicia.<eos> - And that was it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, he asked about my time in Israel, and the IDF and the dairy farm I worked on.<eos> And I talked about my purse business.<eos> - You sell purses?<eos> - No, I make them.<eos> I didn't really end up selling any.<eos> Oh. What did they look like?
CTE sounds right. Get hit in the head that many times, it's bound to catch up with you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Listen, sorry about the other day.<eos> We got slammed.<eos> I get it.<eos> E.D. never sleeps. But if you keep skipping our sessions, buddy, I'm afraid you won't either.<eos> So finally, as we reintroduce blood into your lungs, we will manually compress the pulmonary artery to avoid initial volume overload.<eos> Hey, can I see those lungs again, please, Doc?<eos> Science fiction meets reality.<eos> I just hope they work as well once they're in me.
Get in there.<eos> Show me what I need to see.<eos> Look at the aortic valve.<eos> Valve area's .6.<eos> Cardiologist said it was only mild to moderately stenotic.<eos> I know, but this is critical.<eos> He needs a new valve.<eos> How long have the lungs been perfusing?<eos> Including transport, at least six hours.<eos> They're good for another five to six, but we can't transplant until we fix that valve.
Everyone knows that.<eos> If you apologize, I'm Dr. Manning will understand.<eos> It's her, right?<eos> Why don't we rain-check dinner tonight?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Thanks, Zoe.<eos> We are ready to transplant.<eos> Not yet.<eos> You cut too shallow.<eos> If the vessels are too long. They could thrombose.
Boys will always want to be better than their fathers, which is precisely what their fathers want.<eos> Ready to go?<eos> "What price glory," right?<eos> Headed out?<eos> Made your decision? Yep, just now.<eos> Let me guess...<eos> E.D. strikes again.<eos> No... pathology.<eos> It's the patients.<eos> They come in, and you want to help them.

How you doing?<eos> Dante.<eos> Yeah, I know who you are.<eos> Two years ago, my truck responded to a fire at a pawn shop up the street.<eos> Turned out to be gang headquarters.<eos> Don't remember that.<eos> This guy runs the 24th Street Disciples.<eos> Dante's out of the gang life, Matt.<eos> None of these guys are active anymore.<eos> But they're still connected.

Connor says McCormick is still in a coma.<eos> Doctors don't know what's going on.<eos> Squad should swing by next shift.<eos> Pay respects on behalf of 51.<eos> Is Kelly Severide here?<eos> That's Richter's ex, Gretchen.<eos> What's she doing here?<eos> What are you doing, Kelly?<eos> The report your filed got Kevin called in to headquarters.<eos> They're saying he could be suspended or even fired for lying about the drill.
Two broads on Truck?<eos> Herrmann, come on.<eos> It's 2016, man.<eos> Hey, we'll check in at the nurses' station, get an update.<eos> How's McCormick doing?<eos> Not so good.<eos> Still unconscious.<eos> Sorry to hear that.<eos> I've been suspended.<eos> And now all the guys at the house are icing me out 'cause they think I pushed him, and I'm here now just for show.
Here, boy.<eos> Where's Casey?<eos> Damn it.<eos> Casey, what's the holdup?<eos> Stay where you are.<eos> Casey, report.<eos> Why are they coming back out?<eos> What about Bobby?<eos> Ma'am I can't risk my men's lives for a cat.<eos> They went in after a cat?
- Peter denies everything, including his relationship with you.<eos> - He's probably scared.<eos> - He threw you under the bus.<eos> - He would never do that.<eos> - Professor, we're running out of time.<eos> - You do not know Peter.<eos> - Peter? He's a convicted swindler.<eos> He played you from the get-go.<eos> Lonely hearts, it's the oldest con in the book.<eos> - They are after him.
No, no, no, son, not at all.<eos> My name is Bobby Singer.<eos> And I'm -- I'm here to...<eos> Well, I'm -- I'm stuck here, too.<eos> But, uh, I'm gonna take care of you, okay?<eos> Have you seen your mother?<eos> H-Have you seen anyone...strange?<eos> You mean the sad people?<eos> The who?<eos> They're right behind you.

== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> How's it going over there?<eos> Same.<eos> And you, anything?<eos> Yeah, I-I think so.<eos> Yeah? On Amara, Lucifer, Hand of God?<eos> No, no, it's a -- it's a case.<eos> Werewolves looks like.<eos> Um, a pattern of missing campers -- five in the last three months.<eos> So they got lost.
And we ran.<eos> The bad guys, they're still out there.<eos> Monsters.<eos> Werewolves.<eos> We don't know what their deal was.<eos> Only what that guy told us.<eos> "That guy" saved us, and so did his brother.<eos> Thank you for your time.<eos> Your wife's been through a lot.<eos> I'll give a call to the rangers, have them check out the cabin and the station, then I'll let you know what they find.
Someone has to.<eos> Make...<eos> Jake, drop that.<eos> Listen.<eos> You gotta listen to this.<eos> Here.<eos> Listen.<eos> The... the fabric of society is being torn apart by people like General Walker.<eos> We have seen before, haven't we?<eos> Men of power, grabbing whatever they want.

How come you never tell stories about your life?<eos> About your family, about you and Bill growing up.<eos> You want family stories, I can give you family stories.<eos> That's not my point.<eos> You got something to hide?<eos> I don't wanna hide anything from you.<eos> Good.<eos> I want us to be honest with each other.<eos> I just don't know if I can be.<eos> Sometimes people hide things inside because they're afraid... that if they share them with others...
Sadie is my wife.<eos> She belongs to me.<eos> Now, if you try to breach that bond, then...<eos> Then there will be consequences.<eos> For the both of you.<eos> How's your clothespin?<eos> What, are you wearing it right now?<eos> You live in a small town.<eos> People love to talk.<eos> Now what do you think they'll say once they learn your sad little secrets?
Come on!<eos> - Get up!<eos> How you like that, boy?<eos> Little more for you.<eos> Look, is this... Is this about the money?<eos> The fact is, I-I have some.<eos> Oh, I know you do, 'cause you took it from me.<eos> You thought you were being so clever, making all those bets all over Dallas.<eos> But you know those different places?<eos> They're owned by what you might call my franchise.
Oh, you talking about the camps?<eos> The camps?<eos> I took my mama and my brother and sister to a Kennedy refugee camp back in '75.<eos> After the first bombings, we didn't have no place else to go.<eos> The camps were bad places.<eos> Bad things happened there.<eos> Ellen got taken away, and Tugga joined the militia when he was 15.<eos> I never seen him again.<eos> When Mama died of the flu, I just ran away.<eos> Why were... why were they called "Kennedy camps"?
You know, it doesn't matter how it started.<eos> The point is that it's ended.<eos> Yeah, it's ended.<eos> Or has it?<eos> Danny and Riley, this is your love.<eos> You met on a crisp fall morning at the kindergarten bus stop.<eos> You were inseparable during your young years, your teen years, and even your awkward years.<eos> Coincidentally, those were all the same.<eos> And plus, if you guys don't stay together, these angels will never be born.<eos> Oh, they're so cute.
- God, I hope not.<eos> - Give me a fucking break.<eos> This country is not that great.<eos> It's not even a democracy anymore.<eos> - Then go live in Afghanistan, you got the fucking beard for it.<eos> - You know what the sad thing is?<eos> This country has such potential.<eos> It's not a democracy, you're right.<eos> But it could be, tomorrow.<eos> If the people woke up, they could change the whole thing.
It's not a democracy, you're right.<eos> But it could be, tomorrow.<eos> If the people woke up, they could change the whole thing.<eos> The whole system's set up and waiting.<eos> It's just sitting there like exercise equipment, waiting to be touched while your fat ass watches TV.<eos> If everybody woke up tomorrow and said, "We're not gonna spend another fucking dollar<eos> "or cast another vote or fight another bullshit war until we get our fair share," that shit would change tomorrow.<eos> But it fucking won't, and the framers knew this.<eos> That's the sick part.<eos> They were sitting in their little room with their buckled shoes.
- Hi.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> - Ugh, what a day.<eos> I went to the farmer's market and got some of those purple green beans.<eos> Mm, you remember them?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You know, it's so weird, there's just this one guy and that's all he sells.<eos> You have to come with me to the farmer's market, Horace, it is so sweet.<eos> These people are farmers and they come to Brooklyn to sell their wares.

That we've been here before, right?<eos> But this time was different.<eos> This time there were no reservations.<eos> Did you make the reservations for the chair rentals?<eos> No, I'm finalizing the head count.<eos> Michael's brother's a no, so that's 25.<eos> No, 26... both his parents are driving down.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Aren't they, like, archenemies or something?<eos> Well, they're not in a comic book, but yes, basically.
And guess what was hanging on that wall?<eos> Bug is in the painting?<eos> All the more reason to steal it.<eos> Now, the most logical place to hide the bug would be in this frame, but there's no evidence that it was ever here, so it must be in some other part of the painting.<eos> What's recorded on it?<eos> Hey.<eos> Just got back.<eos> What'd I miss?<eos> A lot.<eos> Before the painting was donated to the Navy, it hung in the Secretary of Defense office for, like, two months.
He's unarmed.<eos> We're gonna need that painting.<eos> I've discovered a new planet of worry.<eos> What if someday Victoria has a best friend whose father is something awesome like a...<eos> like a baseball player or a... or a milkman, because they always have direct access to ice cream?<eos> I mean, how am I supposed to compete with something like that?<eos> You want me to keep talking like this?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes. Because the recording device is voice-activated.<eos> And once it heats up enough, I should be able to see it on the infrared.
Was it as simple as a philosophical gap?<eos> You must've been friends at some point.<eos> You shared the Species handle.<eos> Did you meet to discuss your differences in person?<eos> You're not very good in person, are you?<eos> Maybe he intimidated you, got physical, so you grabbed the sword.<eos> Where were you on Thursday night?<eos> Uh, I-I was... on-online, video chatting with my girlfriend; she's from Manitoba.<eos> What did you do with the Japanese short sword?<eos> Is it in your apartment, hidden under the mattress perhaps?
Back to before the flood.<eos> And you're sure the Doctor won't just leave us here?<eos> Guys, look, this is how we roll.<eos> He's going to go away, come back and we'll have to listen to how he did it.<eos> Is it Moran or Pritchard or the mole guy?<eos> - How... how did they get out?<eos> - No, I don't think it's any of them.<eos> I think it's... a new ghost.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means that something happened in the past, it means that somebody else must have...
When the vice president is incapacitated or dead, their predecessor assumes temporary control of the brotherhood until they return to service or until a replacement is found.<eos> And are you so sure that the vice president and John are... lost?<eos> D.A.R.P.A. has just reported that they've lost an E.M.P. cannon.<eos> Hell of a coincidence.<eos> Coincidences don't exist, do they, Malcolm?<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> I never should have approved this mission.<eos> This E.M.P. cannon...<eos> How the hell did they get their hands on it?<eos> It was in transit, but then it was rerouted into an ambush by an encrypted e-mail.
We don't know who we can trust.<eos> We're gonna have to get her back ourselves.<eos> Hector will spot this government SUV in a second.<eos> I'm gonna have to get a new vehicle.<eos> There's an Earl's Used Car Lot not far from here.<eos> When I'm done with Earl, he is not gonna know what hit him.<eos> Look, this is clearly a government vehicle, not in any of your names.<eos> Hotter than the devil's armpit.<eos> You want to make this swap, you got to throw in some cash.<eos> It needs brakes, brake liners, shocks, new transmission, and the engine's barely an engine.
Four weeks ago, an invisible dome crashed down on Chester's Mill, cutting us off from the rest of the world.<eos> The dome has tested our limits, forcing each of us to confront our own personal demons...<eos> Rage... grief... fear.<eos> My God.<eos> Now, in order to survive, we must battle our most dangerous adversary... the enemy within.<eos> Something's wrong with the dome, Joe.<eos> It's calcifying.
He needs water.<eos> My heart?<eos> Yeah, good thing he doesn't know you don't have one.<eos> Well, who needs a heart... when you got a brain?<eos> Here goes.<eos> "Ground control to Major Tom."<eos> I don't understand.<eos> No signal, radio or otherwise, can get in and out of the dome.<eos> Exactly, that's why I'm jacking up the transmitter's signal.<eos> When it can't get outside the dome, it'll start bouncing off the walls, back and forth, uh, building in strength, kind of like an A.M. radio signal, bouncing off the ionosphere when it cools down at night.
And what will happen to them?<eos> Once we've added to our numbers, we'll come back for those we have to leave behind.<eos> But for now, it's time to begin.<eos> Will it work?<eos> Whatever you're gonna do with the amethysts, the microphones are picking up the sound.<eos> I'm using shortwave to send the signals back to the radio station.<eos> - Yeah, in other words, we're out of here.<eos> - You're not going anywhere.<eos> Well, we have to go back to make sure the transmitter doesn't overheat.<eos> Yeah, 'cause if it crashes, we're all as good as dead, so move.
And I was like, "Bob, I don't know where Kathie is.<eos> You know, I'm presuming she's, she's with you."<eos> Schwank: Kathie is off the grid.<eos> Something happened.<eos> My name is Michael Struk.<eos> I'm retired as a detective from the New York City Police Department.<eos> Jarecki:<eos> Can you just read the details?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, when I, when I initiated the, uh, the missing persons brief narrative, it said, "The complainant, Robert Durst,
Oh, we're just gonna have brunch with Daddy at the club.<eos> That's nice.<eos> What about your mother?<eos> Yeah. What about her?<eos> That's okay.<eos> I have one of those, too.<eos> I'm playing golf with her dad after.<eos> I'm down to a 17 handicap.<eos> Mm! I've known about your handicap for years.<eos> I never knew it had a number.
Take the law by the tail."<eos> "And get a bite at the settlement you deserve."<eos> "I'll make the law"...<eos> Your bitch!<eos> "El Pitbull tambien habla espanol."<eos> Why am I the only one who's never seen this commercial?<eos> Because it comes on late at night, and when you're not moonlighting, your honey-milk-sipping ass is in bed by 10:00.<eos> Why would anyone want to kill the Pitbull?<eos> Maybe CSU will get lucky and find the murder weapon.<eos> Meanwhile, let's get the body to the morgue and see what it can tell us.
We were, like, stunned.<eos> I mean, you know, it's, you know, it's, don't forget it's almost 20 years after the fact.<eos> And all of a sudden, Kathie's disappearance may be close at hand in terms of a solution.<eos> These two guys pulled up in a car, and they came onto the property and said they were detectives and could they come in and look at something in the house and ask me a couple questions.<eos> They looked into a closet, and they took a shelf down and they started pulling things out and dug back to an area that<eos> I guess they were looking for a weapon or, you know, bloodstains or something.<eos> No one had ever searched the house.<eos> No one had ever attempted to search the house, search the lake, search anywhere else.<eos> I mean, it was very telling that there was a whole area that needed to be investigated.<eos> That this case was not investigated the way it should have been.
Back of the head.<eos> That's traditional in mob killings.<eos> The Beverly Hills Police Department received a letter in the mail.<eos> The envelope was addressed "Beverly Hills Police."<eos> Beverly is spelled wrong, spelled with LEY instead of just LY.<eos> And the note read, "1527 Benedict Canyon,"<eos> and the word "Cadaver."<eos> The letter was postmarked the day before the discovery of the victim's body.<eos> That letter says a lot.<eos> It gets mailed to a police department, so that somebody would come and find her body so it's not sitting there, decomposing, rotting away.
Francis?<eos> Francis!<eos> The vision.<eos> Nostradamus's vision.<eos> He saw how Francis died.<eos> It's all coming true.<eos> Why won't his ear stop bleeding?<eos> Is there nothing you can do for him?<eos> It's the infection.<eos> Until his body overcomes the disease, it will keep pushing blood into the ear.
People magazine and the New York papers and television stations, and, of course, you have your local media, You have your TV stations from Houston.<eos> The Post had a stringer there.<eos> AP was in there.<eos> The Daily News sent over an editor.<eos> I mean, everybody saw it as a big story.<eos> The tabloid press can't seem to get enough of the multi-millionaire accused of murder.<eos> So I go to the courtroom, and at some level, I felt sorry for Bob.<eos> I mean, he looked at me. He gave me this little smile.<eos> It wasn't a malicious, "Ha ha! I'm gonna get you next" smile.<eos> It was just kind of like this little smile of recognition.
He had it when he was arrested.<eos> That's the pictures of his wedding, he and Kathie.<eos> He had them when he was arrested.<eos> And there's a picture of Bob as a young boy.<eos> He had them when he was arrested.<eos> When I first met Bob, he was not loud. He was not even terribly responsive, but he had an intelligence. He had some wit to him.<eos> He's disheveled.<eos> He's been through the mill.<eos> He's been held in circumstances in which he's never been, but you have to look past that and see this lump of clay here that I'm going to have to mold.<eos> Has it got the capacity to be molded into the shape that I want it to be in by the time we get to a jury?
There was a concern on our part that, um... the way he sometimes describes things, um, without a lot of emotion, hearing him describe the technical dissection of that body would lead someone to believe he's a cold-blooded killer.<eos> Can you tell us how long it took to out Morris Black up?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Can you tell us where you started? Arms? Legs?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> It was very important to say, "Bob, look.<eos> "Your memory is very fuzzy.<eos> "Your memory on this is naturally repressed.<eos> "We've had psychiatrists, psychologists see you. "They'll all agree.<eos> "For such a horrific event, it's very common
These had squared-off edges.<eos> Wait, so he was killed on one staircase, then later pushed down a second?<eos> It's the perfect way for the killer to cover up the crime.<eos> Also, look at the angle of each strike.<eos> The victim didn't just tumble down the stairs.<eos> He rolled in a curved trajectory.<eos> So we're looking for a grand staircase like the one in the victim's house.<eos> But with steps made from something harder than wood.<eos> The bank where Darius worked!<eos> The-the, the staircase is made out of marble and it's curved.
How's it going?<eos> Yeah, good, yeah.<eos> How is college?<eos> It is good.<eos> Really enjoying it. I didn't think I would be.<eos> But I'm really getting into it.<eos> Me and Mr Sander have got you a little gift.<eos> It's an early Christmas gift.<eos> And, uh, yeah, anyway, open it.<eos> It's not a new one, mind, but it's as good as.
Medium.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> That's yours, isn't it?<eos> Yep.<eos> That's your stuff down here.<eos> What are you going to tell Gadge?<eos> I'll tell him I caught you doing heroin in the toilet, Kelly.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> There's something about immediacy which is really, really important, and what we're going to talk about now is the decisive moment.<eos> So, in 1952, when Cartier-Bresson produced his first book, it had a French title but the English translation was "the decisive moment".
It's never been anything but personal with him.<eos> He wants revenge, Mr. Callen.<eos> Simple, satisfying revenge.<eos> Making us scramble to find the right attack plan-- that was all a ruse.<eos> Meaning... the target remains the same as this morning: the FBI.<eos> Bad news.<eos> I just found Kensi's missing flatbed truck.<eos> That sounds like good news, Ms. Jones.<eos> Yeah, but it just turned off the 10 onto Palms Boulevard.<eos> It's heading for Mar Vista.
Two hours ago, defense contractor ADRD conducted a guided missile test for the Navy.<eos> The intended destination was this target vessel off the Channel Islands.<eos> It was a perfect launch, and then the engineers found themselves in quite a pickle.<eos> Engineers in a pickle.<eos> That never ends well.<eos> Unfortunately, they lost control of the missile, deviated off course.<eos> Was anybody on board?<eos> One of many unanswered questions.<eos> We're concerned that the missile's guidance system has been hacked.<eos> And if it has, we need to find out if other Navy weapon systems have been compromised.
Damaged?<eos> Destroyed.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> And-and what the hell is the Navy doing testing a missile in Marina Del Rey?<eos> Marina Del Rey?<eos> Yeah, that's where it's docked.<eos> Do you have any idea what that boat is worth?<eos> I did upgrades.<eos> Dr. Maslow, your boat wasn't at the marina.<eos> It was off the Ventura coastline.
No, no, I-I'm fine.<eos> I just got to get someplace safe.<eos> These guys are still after me.<eos> What guys? Who?<eos> Some southern-fried D-bags.<eos> They've been after me since I-I dug up "The Book of the Damned."<eos> You found it? Where?<eos> After some near misses and some broken-into museums,<eos> I found historical documents that led to a monastery in Spain.<eos> It burned down years ago, left for dead, but, uh, I had this hunch about it.
I think this is in code.<eos> An entire book of unreadable text that's also in code.<eos> Great.<eos> And you call yourselves nerds.<eos> You got this.<eos> He's right.<eos> You know what, Charlie? Why, uh...<eos> Um, why don't we stick with my notes for a little bit?<eos> This book is literally making my eyes hurt.<eos> What is it?
Great.<eos> And you call yourselves nerds.<eos> You got this.<eos> He's right.<eos> You know what, Charlie? Why, uh...<eos> Um, why don't we stick with my notes for a little bit?<eos> This book is literally making my eyes hurt.<eos> What is it?<eos> She found a way to hide the book.<eos> It was here.

That doesn't solve anything.<eos> Look, just let us translate the book, okay?<eos> If there's a cure, we'll do it and deal with the consequences later.<eos> I can't lose you.<eos> Really? Yeah, really.<eos> You change your mind on that, 'cause that's not what you said last time.<eos> You know I didn't mean that. This is my cross to bear, Sam.<eos> Mine.<eos> And that book is not the answer.<eos> Now, we got to destroy it before it falls into the wrong hands, and that includes me.
Y'all hid the book, didn't you?<eos> Lead-lined little number, I'm betting.<eos> I don't know what the hell you're talking about.<eos> You don't?<eos> That man back there, well, he said the same thing as all the others at truck stops and gas stations up and down the way.<eos> Nobody had seen that redheaded girl.<eos> And then a man bearing that Mark comes in here, to me.<eos> Well, there's coincidence, and then there's just Providence.<eos> See, "The Book of the Damned," it wants to be found.<eos> It wants to come home.
Yeah, sure, I'll tell you.<eos> One more time. I didn't hear you.<eos> I said...<eos> What's going on?<eos> The Stynes, they found me.<eos> Those douches are all jacked up, too. What are you talking about?<eos> I emptied a full clip into one of them before the son of a bitch went down.<eos> Dean, what are you doing with the holy oil?<eos> There is a cure for the Mark in the book.<eos> But it comes at a price.
And, yeah, I suppose we got along okay.<eos> In this line of work, death isn't always goodbye.<eos> Well, this is different.<eos> My mom left me.<eos> "Claire, I'll be home soon.<eos> We'll be home soon".<eos> Doesn't sound like somebody who wanted to abandon you.<eos> -Did you check her credit cards?<eos> -They wouldn't send me her records.<eos> Okay, I know you need to be somewhere far away from all of us... but let me get my laptop, I'll teach you how to hack into her credit-card records. It'll help you get a lead on your mom.
Did you kill that girl in Omaha?<eos> So it's true.<eos> You have the Mark of Cain.<eos> That's why you wanted the book.<eos> To remove it. We wanted the book because that's where your power comes from.<eos> See, our family business is putting guys like you out of business.<eos> That's impressive.<eos> Let me tell you about my family business.<eos> You're in way over your heads.<eos> The family is vast, spread over the world... and that power you mentioned doesn't come from the book... it comes from intelligence and will.
And where does this army call home?<eos> Hmm? Who's the Big Daddy Frankenstein?<eos> Were you here when I mentioned that we're underground?<eos> -There are secrets. -Well, I'm swell at uncovering secrets.<eos> You give me the book... and it's conceivable that we could have a conversation.<eos> The book?<eos> Dude, we don't have the book.<eos> The book was burned.<eos> The book is protected by a spell.<eos> It's eternal.
Ahem. What's the third ingredient?<eos> The third ingredient, it's impossible.<eos> What is it?<eos> Loosely translated? My heart.<eos> That's not impossible at all.<eos> Not my literal heart, feathers.<eos> Something I love. The spell calls for me to kill it.<eos> -A sacrifice.<eos> -Precisely.<eos> The book will grant freedom from the curse, but it wants something in return.
Previously on Teen Wolf...<eos> What does the book do?<eos> It triggers the memory centers of the brain.
Wait, so, how much... How much do you remember anyway?<eos> With the accident, did it play like a movie in your head or was it like being completely in it again?<eos> In it.<eos> Was it just the crash?<eos> Nothing else?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You're not giving up, are you?<eos> Just resting my eyes.<eos> My glow stick broke.<eos> No, it ran out of glow.
Someone is trying to make supernatural creatures with non-supernatural means.<eos> It's only really over when it starts turning silver...<eos> That's when they know you're really a failure.<eos> Kira, I don't want you to leave.<eos> And I don't want to hurt anyone.<eos> Something's changed.<eos> And I think it's because of me.<eos> And I don't know how to fix it.<eos> My asthma is back.<eos> I'm not sure how, but it came back.
After some, uh, lengthy calculations,<eos> I believe I have discovered the key to proving the proposed breach theory.<eos> Exotic matter.<eos> You mean, like, transdimensional energy?<eos> Precisely.<eos> Exotic matter, transdimensional energy will theoretically leak from one universe into another.<eos> Now, if this breach Mr. Garrick's talking about is real, if there is indeed a hole in our universe which leads to his earth...<eos> We can make some adjustments and upload an electrophotography program to the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite and essentially photograph the exotic matter leak.<eos> Thereby giving us the locale of said breach.<eos> Last time I saw the kit, it was in the fabrication room.
We should hang out more.<eos> - Do you fish? - Never.<eos> Never have.<eos> - You should.<eos> We will. - Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> The bullet's nicked the bone, but there's no cord damage. I'd say leave it.<eos> Your call.<eos> This liver's in bad shape.<eos> It's actually avulsed.
- but I think you knew that.<eos> - I've never had luck on my side.<eos> You'd think it'd stop me from betting on cards, but, uh...<eos> What business do you have in Le Havre,<eos> Mr. Collins?<eos> A port town of this size, surely you see your share of outsiders.<eos> We do.<eos> Most of them more than happy to submit to my questions.<eos> And what news do you bring us... from Mary, Queen of Scots?<eos> Forgive the sins of my body, O Lord, as they give my heart the strength it needs to heal.
I received a coded message from McNabb, his second in command.<eos> He found Ridley's body robbed of his possessions, including the letters to the lords at both potential ports in Scotland.<eos> - Louis, those letters bore my seal.<eos> - They were a calculated risk.<eos> The only way for Ridley to prove the legitimacy of his mission.<eos> I need you to seek out McNabb.<eos> Find out what really happened that night.<eos> He's the only one who might be able to help us find Ridley's killer, and I can't risk him being spotted here at court.<eos> If it was a spy for England, we would sail into a trap with or without Ridley's intelligence.<eos> And if it was a spy for France?
Lola, I'm afraid.<eos> When I came to this country,<eos> I left my family behind, my life.<eos> I was terrified.<eos> And I was just your lady, with little responsibility other than standing at my friend's side.<eos> But you, you were fearless.<eos> Standing up to the rulers of France again and again with a fire that I'd never seen.<eos> Fighting for us, for aid, for troops, for Scotland.<eos> Mary, you have been waiting for so long for the day when you can take your throne.<eos> It may not be my throne by the time I get there.
But now I know.<eos> Before you dare to trust anyone else, you must first trust yourself.<eos> Your own power.<eos> That strength I'd thought I'd lost,<eos> I haven't.<eos> It's in me still.<eos> Elizabeth may be the wiser choice.<eos> But I can give you my heart.<eos> My full, strong heart.<eos> What is it?
So you and your boss hug.<eos> He thought that non-erotic contact would comfort me.<eos> - Do you need comforting?<eos> - No.<eos> - Great car.<eos> - That's what people say.<eos> You may not drive it.<eos> - Have you read the case file?<eos> - Yeah, I've done that at least.<eos> - It's not so big yet.
Looking for something long-term?<eos> Why are you asking?<eos> Otherwise your evening must also have been a failure.<eos> Are you suggesting what I think you're suggesting?<eos> No, I'm not suggesting anything.<eos> It could be interpreted that you think we should have sex.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, it could be interpreted like that, or yes, you think we should have sex?<eos> Yes, I think we two should have sex.<eos> But it has to be at your place.
- Totally Danish? - Yeah.<eos> 2009.<eos> Missing persons.<eos> - Why should I look at it?<eos> - Because you might find something new.<eos> - Was it your case?<eos> - No.<eos> I've checked all the cars that passed the surveillance camera that day.<eos> - A white van.<eos> Guess whose it is.
You are simply too good to stand there and doubt yourself.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth.<eos> You who know me know that my parents have fought.<eos> We didn't go the movies often, or go out and eat.<eos> But we went to the museum.<eos> "One can't see too many beautiful things," my father said.<eos> And it was free for kids.<eos> But not everything was beautiful. The art could be disturbing demanding and daunting.<eos> It made me think about life.

Because she's the mother of your child, isn't she?<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> - Hi, Honey.<eos> - Say we really did it.<eos> - Did what?<eos> - The child.<eos> Of course we did it.<eos> I don't know if they're going to be good parents for my child.<eos> It's not your child, Jeanette.<eos> - It's more mine than hers.
POLICE.<eos> STUPID.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Get away!<eos> - My son!<eos> - It's empty.<eos> - My son!<eos> - It's empty! The stroller is empty!<eos> It's empty!
It's on the way there.<eos> Rasmus is following as best as he can.<eos> He's in contact with John.<eos> Just drive. I'll take care of this.<eos> - Rasmus, where are you now?<eos> - Strandlodsvej.<eos> Good.<eos> Head to the left, going north.<eos> - Where is the helicopter now?<eos> - It's going southeast towards an industrial area.
- No.<eos> The bed is another brand.<eos> The wash basin... another brand.<eos> They're similar, but not identical.<eos> But the painting there is exactly the same.<eos> The car that Rasmus saw was reported stolen yesterday morning in Lomma.<eos> - There's no trace? - Not yet. - What is that?<eos> - A painting.<eos> - Yes, I see that.<eos> - It's from the foster home where Emil lived.

Interesting.<eos> Can I sign this twice?<eos> Actually, you know who should be on this?<eos> That girl who listens to The Fray and has the "99% angel" sticker on her BMW.<eos> She doesn't deserve to get asked to prom.<eos> Stop it.<eos> As head of the prom committee, I forbid this.<eos> I forbid it. [snaps pencil]<eos> He got him a latte?<eos> Is it vanilla flavored?
- $100 for the "dust" I can't give you better deal for that.<eos> - You know what ?<eos> I'll keep the 9, and I'll comeback for the "dust" later...<eos> - Done.<eos> - Later.<eos> - Later man.<eos> - Hello ! Hi...<eos> Good evening ! I'm looking for a hospital... It has a blue facade...<eos> - I'm sorry, I don't speak spanish !<eos> - It has a huge pigeon on top...
Yeah. Ow! Son of a...<eos> God.<eos> You're listening to The Morning Drive Time with Big Stain and Willie.<eos> It's ten minutes after the hour, and we're back with Molly Flynn, talking about her sexy new book, Within Her Walls.<eos> Ooh! Welcome, Molly.<eos> Thank you, Big Stain.<eos> It's nice to be here.<eos> So, this book...<eos> I hear it's, uh, one spicy read. (growls)<eos> Well... Well, it definitely has its moments, but it's really a story about a woman on a journey of self-discovery.

Well, it definitely has its moments, but it's really a story about a woman on a journey of self-discovery.<eos> I think Willie liked your book.<eos> Well, thank you, Willie.<eos> Um...<eos> Hopefully, it will appeal to a broad audience.
It actually drove him crazy.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Anyway, my, uh... my father made all these tapes.<eos> His manifesto of sorts.<eos> And I have them back at the camp.<eos> Now, sometimes when he's rambling, he talks about a defiant pupil.<eos> That this defiant pupil is the indisputable proof that his theory was correct.<eos> What is this "Defiant pupil"?<eos> Well, that's just it.<eos> Up until today, I thought it was a student.
When you stick with someone during the hard times.<eos> But, of course, that is when they need you the most.<eos> If you have come now, two years after your father's death, it must be because you need something.<eos> A pride of male lions in Africa... their-their behavior was, uh...<eos> Troubling.<eos> I believe that my father may have additional research that can shed some further light on the lions', um... changing behavior.<eos> So it has begun.<eos> The awakening of the animals' cognitive acuity.<eos> I would love to give you the rest of your father's work, but it is not here.<eos> It remains where he conducted his final experiments.
I haven't even taken a bath.<eos> Oh, no, I'm not getting my cake from here.<eos> No, this is my bridal shower.<eos> Yeah, I want to get something classic from Baskin Robbins that's also a Dunkin' Donuts.<eos> They mix those two now?<eos> It's a stoner's dream come true.<eos> I tried to make our apartment look nice.<eos> I even moved a chair to cover a stain, but what was under the chair was so much worse.<eos> I guess what I'm saying is, please don't shoot us.<eos> Well, I don't expect it to look that good.
Yes, thanks.<eos> What is this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The house below, that is burned out, it was Mr. Costa's.<eos> He committed suicide just before the flood.<eos> Do you think there's a link?<eos> For a long time, this hamlet was called "the hand of God".<eos> Did you know?<eos> No.<eos> Since it's on the heights, those who lived here were saved from the flood when the dam broke.
We count on you.<eos> Mysterious music<eos> Regular beeps<eos> Julie strikes.<eos> Musique heavy<eos> - Julie ?<eos> - I was looking for you.<eos> Mr. Lewanski eyelids moved.<eos> - The nervous system works intermittently.<eos> It may not wake up right away.
I do not understand.<eos> Where was this child, all this time?<eos> - I do not know.<eos> - Yesterday morning, He Was in front of you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Why are you not coming?<eos> - I Went to see Father Jean-François.<eos> I trust _him_.<eos> -.<eos> Good Your child Will Be Examined so That We know if it Has not the aftermath of the abduction.
Stock price isn't the only consideration.<eos> Ginelle...<eos> Half my portfolio is exposed.<eos> I need to know my position before the market opens.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Let's take a look.<eos> Turn over three cards.<eos> You're in a unique position to leverage the forces around you.<eos> The upright "chariot" card, that's about maintaining your focus and your confidence.<eos> Your money is safe where it is, Martin.
We follow the same logic saying:<eos> "We do not respect the patenting of seeds."<eos> We received these seeds Nature, through farmer selection of centuries.<eos> They can not be patented.<eos> We will continue to protect and share.<eos> Do you think it is better to repair the system or change it?<eos> We can not sustain unlimited economic growth on a finite planet.<eos> Infinite growth is not sustainable in a finite world.<eos> So this system can not continue indefinitely.<eos> If it continues, it will destroy the planet and if you go back, it will create unemployment and recession.
The actual employer, which ensures our security and livelihoods, it is the earth, the sun, mountains, rivers, rain, human solidarity learn to use our hands to work together.<eos> There in abundance.<eos> We do not need a mortgage to live well.<eos> We do not need to multinationals providing just numbers on a computer, and that make us believe that it survives thanks to them.<eos> We do not eat the numbers on computers.<eos> What is money, really?<eos> The money is a mere idea, a plastic card or numbers on a computer.<eos> Money is not real. no numbers are eating.<eos> Money is a medium of exchange.<eos> It provides no security.
And... the golden girl there is Henrietta.<eos> And now don't let her sass you.<eos> She gets a little attitude on account of she's so damn beautiful.<eos> So beautiful.<eos> Girls, this is Marnie.<eos> Hey.<eos> Was out here a couple months ago and I brought that boombox with me and I was playing some tunes.<eos> And I looked at their faces, and I swear they just looked happy.<eos> So I did a little experiment to try and find out what kind of music they dig the most.<eos> Turns out, rock 'n' roll makes 'em lay eggs like crazy, but it does stress 'em out a little bit.
And then, when she started to slip away, I was just gripping and...<eos> She's in a reha... in a program now. She's in a program.<eos> Kept hoping one of those steps would lead her back here, but...<eos> I think I just made her scared to tell me things.<eos> Sure, what... Look what you were seeing every day, all that serial killers and stuff.<eos> I mean, I watch the news, never mind being part of it, it's like being in an action movie or something.<eos> Yeah, well... not anymore.<eos> It's not your fault the world's a scary place.<eos> Thank God you're retired.<eos> Yep. Yeah, it has its moments.
If someone is using the laptop, we can find them.<eos> The signal just disappeared!<eos> Everything OK?<eos> It's the safe house raid.<eos> Some of the details just aren't adding up.<eos> No!<eos> No, no.<eos> You don't understand. No, no.<eos> I did manage to track where the laptop's been used.<eos> It's inside the FBI.
You think it's legit?<eos> I think we always plan for the worst.<eos> This was a mistake.<eos> Just hold it together.<eos> We just need that name, and then we're out of here.<eos> Change of plans.<eos> Before I help you, you two are gonna help me with something.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> That was not part of the deal.<eos> The deal is what I say it is.
No.<eos> Really?<eos> That's not why you were a step slow back at the house?<eos> I threw a guy out a window.<eos> You call that slow?<eos> I don't call that slow.<eos> Any word from Mike on Sloan?<eos> No. FBI has her leaving the office at 8:00 last night.<eos> Mike went by her apartment.<eos> It was empty.
I just came in here to give you this.<eos> You mean...<eos> Today is the day I work for you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> This is really happening?<eos> What do we do first?<eos> I mean, I'm so goddamn turned on right now.<eos> I don't know. Maybe we could get a jump on some of the things that have been piling up since Norma.<eos> Well, my Dictaphone's at full capacity, it's about to burst.
And what is that?<eos> That you have another contract that doesn't care about the name of your company.<eos> They only care about the name of the owner.<eos> How the hell did Katzen even know to sell their debt?<eos> Because I made a mistake.<eos> You sure as hell did!<eos> After asking for 20% of my company and bragging that you could save it.<eos> Well, it turns out it, you're just an arrogant mouthpiece that thinks he can save anything.<eos> But you can't.<eos> Kevin, nobody hates change more than I do, but it's coming whether we like it or not.
A real class act, that Mr. "please, kids, call me Dan" Hoffman.<eos> Only statuary raped Jamie for six months before breaking her heart under the bleachers.<eos> When Jamie's diary was discovered,<eos> George Reed went to the Hoffman house and shot Daniel Hoffman twice in the chest.<eos> I pointed the gun at his chest and shot him twice, maybe three times.<eos> Do you want to know what I would have done if that was my kid? Both:<eos> No.<eos> Did the police look into other suspects, other leads?<eos> There was no investigation because there was nothing to investigate... the case was closed.<eos> Well, now it's open.
Quinn, I signed an agreement.<eos> Even if I talked, it wouldn't do any good.<eos> He's destroyed any and all evidence that could point to the existence of B613.<eos> As far as the world knows, it was never there.<eos> Really?<eos> Because we've got $2 billion that says it was.<eos> What?<eos> The money Huck stole from B613.<eos> That money doesn't prove anything.<eos> No, it came from their accounts.
She should have come after just me, and instead, she targeted the innocent.<eos> No, you're not hearing me.<eos> Oh, but I am hearing you, Margaux.<eos> Amanda Clarke is chaos theory, and I cannot let this continue.<eos> Victoria, it won't undo anything.<eos> Except her.<eos> Then I can't stand in your way, but I won't help you, either.<eos> Why call Tom Kingsly?<eos> What's her plan?<eos> Whatever it was, we shut it down.
Clara, no!<eos> Have you still got the eye-patch thing?<eos> Clara!<eos> Point it at my chains and think the word "open".<eos> Say it with your mind.<eos> Welcome to Valhalla, my ladies.<eos> No, wait! Wait!<eos> There's nothing to fear, strange maiden.<eos> We are Odin's chosen.<eos> The wall, it moves!
And I don't want to lose my mind, okay?<eos> In fact, I think that right now it's happening.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Everything is gonna be okay.<eos> Yeah? Okay, right now, neurotransmitters in your brain have sent the wrong signal... Uh-huh?<eos> You just need to ride this out until your parasympathetic nervous system can restore your body to a normal state.<eos> That's good.<eos> Can you do me a favor and speak English, please?<eos> Okay. Your body is lying to you.<eos> It's telling you you're in danger, but you're not.
Thank you.<eos> Thanks, guys.<eos> So how long was I out?<eos> Couple hours.<eos> Can I get you anything?<eos> No, no. Thanks.<eos> All right, well, if you're not gonna eat anything, I want you to at least drink something.<eos> Let me see what we have.<eos> You know, I was looking for my phone.<eos> Uh, thought I left it by the bed, but it's not there.
We're going back in time.<eos> I'm looking for this woman.<eos> Barbara Colton?<eos> Now's not really a good time.<eos> That ring.<eos> I was right, she make Thinnies.<eos> We got to put this ring on a Colton.<eos> Without a Colton, we cannot get into the Void.<eos> Your trip didn't change anything.<eos> It changed everything.
What the--?<eos> Don't...<eos> Honey, what's wrong?<eos> You left your cane.<eos> I didn't need it.<eos> For the first time in I don't know how long, Char, I just got up and walked.<eos> - Ha-ha-ha. Oh...<eos> - Just a few steps.<eos> - The treatment?<eos> - It's working.
I don't take anything you say at face value.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> My interest in Powell's research was only half the picture.<eos> This was always about Roger Hobbs.<eos> I used the FBI to create a problem for Roger.<eos> I needed the man to be in my debt, and now he is.<eos> Roger Hobbs is a murderer.<eos> He may not have conducted those experiments but according to the law, he is just as guilty and now without Powell, we can't prove it.<eos> Don't be so quick to make an enemy of Roger Hobbs.<eos> You don't see it yet, Lizzy, but a dark cloud is approaching and when it arrives Roger Hobbs will be a very good friend at exactly the moment he needs to be.
I will not lie.<eos> Others have urged me to do just that.<eos> And I am fully prepared to cut your candle short.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Merely to help you be you.<eos> I know you find it hard to believe, but I hold no malice against you.<eos> And yet you would kill me 100 ways.<eos> As I would a savage untrained dog.<eos> But first, I might try to train it.<eos> And if that dog would accept the muzzle, then I might find that it no longer posed a threat to every innocent that passed by, may even become a... trusted companion.
It's a magical place.<eos> I'd love to see it.<eos> I think you should.<eos> Don't wait too long.<eos> I cheated on you.<eos> I went to see Sam.<eos> I'm not in competition with Sam.<eos> - I believe in western medicine.<eos> - So what would you have said?<eos> That your knee is talking to you and it's saying, "stop training so hard."
Wow, you've grown!<eos> - Yeah. That happens.<eos> And Grace!<eos> - Oh!<eos> Hi. Abigail, I've heard so much about you.<eos> I'm glad to finally meet you, I don't really remember you from before.<eos> Well, you were very young last time that I visited.<eos> Dad, are you here?<eos> Some Paul guy keeps calling, something about his sick kid.<eos> He tried your cell, but it goes straight to voice-mail.
I think I should give it from atop a snowplow.<eos> That's very Patton-esque.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Maybe I've misjudged him.<eos> Hey. How's it going out there?<eos> It's pretty slick.<eos> It came down so fast.<eos> It's not so bad.<eos> - I was on a call, I found her walking home in this weather. - I love weather.<eos> - Weather loves me too, it never bites.
But you?<eos> Grace.<eos> I have to say, I'm disappointed.<eos> Hey Cassie, it's me.<eos> It's, like, the fourth time I've called.<eos> I tried calling Grey House but I keep getting a busy signal.<eos> I hope you're OK.<eos> I'm getting a little worried.<eos> Call me, please.<eos> I'm gonna head home as soon as it clears.
The way that I like to work with all my clients is that I respectfully steer them<eos> In the right direction.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> Ben doesn't like to be steered, and neither do I.<eos> He'll never know.<eos> I'll tell him.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because when it comes to business, I tell my father everything.<eos> Your father?<eos> It's still coming down.
For which one of us?<eos> Brandon.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I'm OK.<eos> Just a little car accident, bumped my head.<eos> I'm as good as new.<eos> I tried to call.<eos> If I had called<eos> Earlier or if I had...<eos> - If you were with me when it happened?
I never had to stay, Cassie<eos> I wanted to.<eos> And I want to as well.<eos> And the best part is we came to that decision together.<eos> Thanks, Cassie.<eos> - Nice turnout. - Yeah.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> Nah... you know,<eos> Nick really loves that scroll that you gave him.<eos> Yeah. It had special meaning for me when I was just a little older than he is now.

You're needed in the Situation Room.<eos> Elizabeth.<eos> What's up?<eos> Blake couldn't give me any details.<eos> That's because it's need to know.<eos> Okay, what do I need to know?<eos> Russian war games have gotten heated.<eos> One of their subs split from the fleet and has crossed into US coastal waters.<eos> That's aggressive, but not unprecedented.<eos> Sure, Russians like to test our defenses, just like we test theirs, but we were tracking the sub, and it vanished.

Why park a sub off of Alaska?<eos> Juneau would be gone in 30 seconds.<eos> And then the sub would disappear down the coast, to Seattle,<eos> L.A.<eos> How long before we can physically engage?<eos> You mean threaten it, sir?<eos> Capture it and report it?<eos> I mean destroy it.<eos> Sir, our closest surface vessel is the Navy minesweeper Kirkland.<eos> It can be at the site within 90 minutes.
Saw the Kirkland take the hit. Damn it.<eos> Mr. President, I've got NORTHCOM and the Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet requesting immediate authority to engage.<eos> We just got a communiqué from the Russians.<eos> Their vessel was defending itself, and any further attack will be met with quote, "overwhelming retaliatory force."<eos> Without getting into specifics. Call their bluff, sir.<eos> They're entirely in the wrong.<eos> They're guilty of an act of war.<eos> Well, all due respect, we don't know who's guilty of what.<eos> I'm just saying, Mr. President, before we declare war, let's determine exactly who we're going to war with.<eos> What if that sub hasn't moved because it's incapable of moving?
If it's coming through the ventilation system, it kicks on zone by zone, one at a time so it doesn't overload.<eos> What zone goes first?<eos> 5 down to 1.<eos> Walter's in Zone 1.<eos> How much time do we have? Only about a minute per zone.<eos> By the time Walter and Simon are outside, I want sharpshooters on the bluff across the street and the rooftop on the other side of the parking lot.<eos> No way.<eos> I'm three minutes away from bugging everyone out for a mile radius of here.<eos> The incinerator's vent has a hole that you made.<eos> So once the gas is released into Zone 1, it can escape from the vents and kill all of us.
There. Oh, my God.<eos> That's Ralph.<eos> Ralph is in the building!<eos> How the hell did he get in there?<eos> What is he doing in there?<eos> ! Paige, you don't know where you're going!<eos> Happy! He's heading north into Zone 1.<eos> What the hell is he thinking?<eos> No idea, but he is crawling into a vent shaft that leads to the crawl space that Walter and Cabe took from - the incinerator vent.<eos> - Oh, man. He knows that if that gas is released in Zone 1, it will escape through the hole in the vent.
He's trying to save the city.<eos> Oh, uh, Sly, Walter fixed the server hub.<eos> You shut down the incinerator now!<eos> I have spent my life since the bombing raids trying to atone for the deaths.<eos> I will not rest until I have saved at least that number that have died.<eos> Please do not add any more lives to that list.<eos> It's already too late.<eos> The incinerator is shut off.<eos> But I can't see Ralph. He's off the surveillance grid.<eos> Once the gas is released into Zone 1, how long before it escapes through the incinerator hole?
I didn't raise you to be a doormat.<eos> Oh, so you raised me?<eos> Don't tell Mom and Dad.<eos> Look.<eos> It's the aliens!<eos> Get away from the window!<eos> It's okay, Jon Stewart says they're friendly.<eos> Watch out!<eos> She's got it.<eos> Josh, help me put this stuff back where it was.
It reminds us that everything we do matters...<eos> Every decision, every action.<eos> So your code is more important than doing what's right?<eos> You don't get to decide what's right!<eos> That's why we have codes.<eos> I looked into the eyes of the monster who stole everything that I held dear to me.<eos> And I thought, "I'm gonna take the lungs of the man who nearly destroyed the human race, and I'm gonna use those lungs to save it."<eos> I didn't have to kill him to make the breakthrough.<eos> I could have got exactly what I needed and spared his life.<eos> But as I witnessed... That virus do to him what it did to so many, as I watched his last, noxious breath leave his body,
You just sent 10,000 people to their deaths.<eos> Stop hiding behind civilians.<eos> You want to fight?<eos> Come out and fight.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You against me.<eos> Oh, it won't just be me, captain.<eos> You see, the number of your enemies is about to multiply.<eos> Someone's accessing the immune cellphone remotely.<eos> It's pairing with mine.
We've already done that. OK.<eos> Insert rod into top pole until base connects.<eos> Isn't that what got us into this mess in the first place?<eos> Oh, hey, hey, don't cry.<eos> What... What are you worried about?<eos> I don't know, I just...<eos> What?<eos> I don't want the baby to spoil everything.<eos> Well, it's not going to do that.<eos> How would it do that?
Warren, Clarke, you may proceed.<eos> So tell us now of all ye spied, Thomas Nutter, and Mr Clarke will take heed of it and writ as evidence your cursed testimony.<eos> That we may better remember the facts of this matter.<eos> My name is Thomas Nutter, and this here be my wife, Sarah Nutter.<eos> We did, yesternight and for many nights afore, spy Elizabeth Gadge, mother of my wife, creep abroad and meet with a fiend... CROWD WHISPERS<eos> ..covered, as we saw, in brown fur, and suck upon a black teat until sunrise.<eos> ! GASPS AND CHATTER Swear you to these sights, Goody Nutter?<eos> Indeed it is true, sir.<eos> I have followed her myself whilst Thomas has been sleeping or at shit and I sometimes seen a white dog appear and dance a jig.<eos> Yes, it lives next door.
Elizabeth Gadge has yet to confess to her crimes.<eos> I propose one final test that will seal her fate in your eyes and in the eyes of God.<eos> The court calls the demon known as Snowflake.<eos> Please, please, remain calm.<eos> You have nothing to fear.<eos> Christ in heaven!<eos> It's transformed itself into a bottle!<eos> The bottle is indeed a bottle and the familiar hides inside.<eos> Richard, release the imp.<eos> But look you, be careful, lest it may bite.
At least she looks really happy.<eos> I'm glad we're here.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Hi, Lily Bean.<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> - Thanks, Aunt Bess!<eos> - Oh, you're so big!<eos> Oh, my God! You're heavy!<eos> Did you make a good wish?<eos> Yeah, and I know it'll come true.
Thanks.<eos> Let me think and I'll call you.<eos> Hello.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Is your father home?<eos> - Yes. Please come in.<eos> The company said that if we find something, we need to report it to the police.<eos> And the state gives us 30% of its value.<eos> No. If we go and we find anything, then we get in the car, drive to Bucharest, and sell the gold to gypsies.<eos> They'll melt it down, and nobody will know it used to be coins.
- To mark our route, so we don't cover the same ground twice.<eos> - I told you on the phone.<eos> - I forgot.<eos> Want to see the image?<eos> - Where's the save icon?<eos> - It's just a chart.<eos> Where's the pointer?<eos> Ah, here.<eos> Here it is.<eos> It should have today's date.
- It's just a chart.<eos> Where's the pointer?<eos> Ah, here.<eos> Here it is.<eos> It should have today's date.<eos> The 24th, that's the latest one.<eos> Come on!<eos> That's today's date!<eos> What the hell?<eos> I don't get how it can see 30 meters down.
If it's a long way, the shot's less effective.<eos> That's why I said it's best to catch them inside.<eos> I had a maple over there, and they've cut it down.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Back there.<eos> Your garden goes back beyond the trees?<eos> Yes.<eos> - So how did they carry it?<eos> - They didn't.<eos> It's still there.
- How deep did you say it goes?<eos> - 2 meters.<eos> So if we don't find anything at 2 meters, there's nothing.<eos> I don't know.<eos> We'd have to try then and see.<eos> Or bring the other one.<eos> So, if we dig for 2 meters, and don't find anything?<eos> - We try the detector again?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And if it shows 3 digits, you'll make us dig more?
Let's call Lica.<eos> - Lica?<eos> - The thief I mentioned.<eos> Better to go back to Bucharest and try to open it there.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Your papers, please.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> We were just coming to see you.<eos> We've found some treasure, and, as the law says, I understand it needs to be checked.
Well, it seems like Shepherd's plan works.<eos> Chief Hunt, I think that her plan underestimates the severity of...<eos> We should do the minimum possible to maintain the mobility this patient wants and then work up from there.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, back to the sawmill for me.<eos> How is it?<eos> ! It was only in the stock pot for two minutes!<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Then I want to see this penis.<eos> But first I want to see the man that it belonged to.
But first I want to see the man that it belonged to.<eos> [Glove snaps] That is a nice, clean cut. Hmm.<eos> Thomas: I keep my knives sharp.<eos> Huh. Well, it will make reattachment much easier.<eos> Will it ever... work again?<eos> Mr. Archibald, I don't want you to worry.<eos> I've reattached many phalluses.<eos> This... situation is not as uncommon as you might think.<eos> Your vessels and nerves are intact, so chances are very good that when I'm finished, you'll be able to go right back to doing whatever it is you were doing before you got yourself into this mess.<eos> Jackson's prepped the phallus, and it's in the O.R. waiting for you.
This is... this is good.<eos> Miss Campbell.<eos> Agent Shafer with the FBI.<eos> - We met at the prison.<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> Agent Shafer.<eos> I see what you did there.<eos> You, uh... you said my name louder than necessary as if to alert somebody in your room of my presence.<eos> Yeah, my subterfuge game isn't so tight.<eos> Well, frankly, it's terrible.
It could be a sign of metabolic disease or postmortem damage.<eos> Or if the body was pushed up against a rock wall inside a strong hydraulics system.<eos> Like a whirlpool?<eos> Exactly. Yeah.<eos> Meeting go okay?<eos> It's anonymous for a reason, okay, Aubrey?<eos> I just want to do my job.<eos> Where's the arm?<eos> We're not sure.<eos> But if it's still in there,
Only your ego is bruised.<eos> This is the beauty of Aikido.<eos> It is not about harming your opponent.<eos> It does not attack. It defends.<eos> It requires skill, not strength, to turn your opponent's aggression against him.<eos> That is how a woman can defeat a man twice her size.<eos> - Miss Crain, congratulations.<eos> - Thanks, Doni.<eos> You can call me Juliana, you know.<eos> Your necklace, it's very lovely.
And the cargo?<eos> Coffeemakers.<eos> So your men shoot at us to keep us from intercepting coffeemakers?<eos> They were stolen.<eos> He didn't want to go to jail.<eos> You're the leader of the resistance for east New York, Mr. Warren.<eos> We've known it for a month now, ever since we intercepted one of these.<eos> This is the symbol of your movement, is it not?<eos> We know where that truck was headed.<eos> And what it was carrying.
- Good.<eos> Then do as you're told.<eos> - You're smiling, Erich.<eos> - You already know the answers to any of questions that he would ask this man.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - So the subject will die<eos> - in captivity.<eos> - Indeed.<eos> His friends in the resistance will see his disfigured body, and they will conclude that he was only so badly beaten because he refused to talk.<eos> They will conclude that we don't know that truck is headed to Canon City, or what it is carrying.
Hang on.<eos> I'm gonna get you home. You're gonna be all right.<eos> You scared the crap out of me.<eos> I think I'm--I'm ok. What happened?<eos> We were on our first date.<eos> What?<eos> Damon!<eos> Damon--I'm getting-<eos> - I'm getting my memories back.<eos> Damon, the cure, it undid the compulsion. I...
Yes.<eos> Out of guilt or affection, even though he's lost to her.<eos> Has she no idea what she risks?<eos> !<eos> Your forgiveness, your protection, your mercy... forever.<eos> General, it bodes well for you that you're having an audience with our king again so soon.<eos> In fact, His Majesty wasn't too pleased today.<eos> We suffered a setback he did not appreciate.<eos> You don't seem too concerned by the king's displeasure with you.<eos> Well, with the state of France as it is, the king needs me around now more than I need him.
Protestant France would be reward enough for her.<eos> She will always see Mary as a threat.<eos> Not if Mary becomes my wife.<eos> She wouldn't be the first person to do so for political gain.<eos> And as the ruler of a Protestant country allied with England, she would no longer be a threat to Elizabeth.<eos> Do you honestly believe that I would give up my kingdom, my wife?<eos> Surrender now and Mary will live.<eos> Your plan relies on the cooperation of a fickle<eos> English queen who does not take kindly to the advice of others.<eos> It also relies on me losing my head.
Well, if a monster should come down here,<eos> I have plenty of arrows to shoot it with.<eos> They're saying the creature might even be Delphine herself.<eos> Maybe she can transform,<eos> - shift into other beings.<eos> - You're telling me to worry about some make-believe monster when thousands of actual soldiers outside the castle... where I should be...<eos> - are waiting to kill us?<eos> - I'm telling you I know what I saw.<eos> The danger is not only outside the walls.<eos> It's inside as well.
You have no idea how bad this looks, do you?<eos> Bash... you have to believe me.<eos> I didn't murder anyone, or draw that pentagram.<eos> You are suspected of ungodly acts, pagan rites, and the boy who says you involved him ends up murdered in your chambers.<eos> What are people supposed to think?<eos> My God, I'll die for this.<eos> You are the king's brother.<eos> Talk to him, save me.<eos> Devil worship is an act against God.<eos> It is the church's purview.
Aah!<eos> My lord, are you unwell?<eos> I feel like I'm on fire.<eos> Get back, witch!<eos> She's getting away!<eos> Get her!<eos> I will love you for the rest of my life.<eos> And I will never let you go again.<eos> I hope she's pregnant soon.<eos> A child is vital, and it will help protect her in France as well.
Who am I if I heal?<eos> I want to meet her.<eos> You're kidding, right?<eos> She's my grandmother.<eos> I'd like to know where I come from.<eos> I can't believe you're not on my side with this.<eos> I'm not taking sides.<eos> We have no relatives.<eos> Roscoe had to make a family tree for school last year.<eos> It had one leaf.
One percent of the one percenters.<eos> There.<eos> That one.<eos> That's the issue she was waving around.<eos> "Living large with Joe and Susan Parks."<eos> - Are there any photos from inside the house?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Look... that their closet?<eos> That's twice the size of my bedroom.<eos> And it doesn't have little clown letters that spell out "Linus" over the door.
Anything to harass or incite fear at home.<eos> It's the first we're hearing about it.<eos> Because we've been tracking the activity and shutting down the bogus accounts before it escalates.<eos> It just did, to murder.<eos> Your thief and our cyber terrorist hit the same house on the same night, both thinking it was empty.<eos> Terrorist-- as in singular?<eos> Do you know who this guy is?<eos> The group is run by a man named Omer Malik, a British national operating online.<eos> Actually, "group" may be a misnomer.<eos> It's just him.
Hey, what are you doing here?<eos> Hey, slow down!<eos> Wait...<eos> Get the hell away from me!<eos> Get away from me!<eos> Get away!<eos> No!<eos> - Please tell me you have the camera.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> Is it missing?
Only thing I like about Christine is watching her walk away.<eos> We don't make deals.<eos> It's simple.<eos> Tell us about the egg, or we torture you.<eos> And this... this is a preview.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> Stop.<eos> I know where the egg is.<eos> I stole it.<eos> It's here on Bird Island.
We're gonna talk to whoever's in charge, and we're gonna make a little trade, your life for my ticket out of this godforsaken dome.<eos> Any questions?<eos> Which way?<eos> Drop the weapon.<eos> I'm walking out of here.<eos> You try to stop me, he dies.<eos> You killed your own man.<eos> Yes.<eos> For the egg.<eos> Where is it?
I'm Christine Price, and this is my friend Eva.<eos> Excuse me, I need some air.<eos> And you all know each other?<eos> We all have something to contribute.<eos> And I'll set up an office here in this building.<eos> If anybody needs support, come find me.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You were snooping.<eos> - Please tell me you have the camera.<eos> - What's wrong, is it missing?
What are you doing with my dog?<eos> Indy. Hey, hey. It's okay, boy.<eos> Hey.<eos> It's okay, boy.<eos> You weren't honest with me about the egg, Mr. Rennie.<eos> The egg is not on Bird Island.<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait!<eos> I lied.<eos> It's at Town Hall.
Christine's got it.<eos> You've lost your chance.<eos> Martin, take this animal into the next room and slaughter it.<eos> No, no!<eos> Wait, wait!<eos> Wait.<eos> All right.<eos> It's smashed.<eos> I broke it.<eos> It's broken.
- The effect that that has when injected into an uninfected host is of great interest.<eos> However, if you're successful in getting us the information we want, you'll be spared that future.<eos> The choice is yours.<eos> Where do you want me to start?<eos> How about the beginning?<eos> Christine and I work for Aktaion.<eos> We were told we could help the world.<eos> So they hired us to find fragments of meteors from a shower that hit the earth 25 years ago.<eos> When Melanie found the egg.<eos> It was in one of the meteors.
Oh, my God.<eos> Looks like a meteor!<eos> Well, at least, the pink stars seem to calm everyone down.<eos> Audrey said, "There's no one to guide us."<eos> She must have meant Christine.<eos> Well, where is she?<eos> I don't know, but until she shows up, we have to make sure the town stays safe.<eos> Was that the dome?<eos> Tell me it'll protect us from the meteors.<eos> It held against the largest non-nuclear ordnance the military has.
Plan B.<eos> All right, it should be down here.<eos> What about<eos> The Truth Hertz, A Fun Guide to Sound?<eos> Even books with lame-ass titles could probably tell us something about that sketch.<eos> So you think Big Jim is right... that this is the way to take down the dome?<eos> The military has devices that can immobilize armies using sonar technology.<eos> So, yeah, I guess sound could be used as a weapon.<eos> But what if it's not a weapon?<eos> What if it's, like, a beacon?
Joe, this is me.<eos> It's the same guy that found you at the Sweetbriar after Angie died.<eos> I was there for you then; I am here for you now.<eos> If I was one of them, wouldn't I want you to stay here and build this thing?<eos> All right, point taken.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> So, the dome...<eos> is it calcifying?<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay, then it's sealing up.
What happened to plan B?<eos> Didn't work out.<eos> Hell.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> I got to go meet Barbie.<eos> Joe's a double agent.<eos> And all we have to do is stay alive until he builds Christine's device, assuming it works.<eos> Well, it better.<eos> Because the dome is calcifying.<eos> If it doesn't come down, then we're all dead.
Norrie and I just saw her.<eos> She looks almost full-term.<eos> And I'm pretty sure 12 girls just died to make it the world's shortest pregnancy.<eos> Well, then, we got to kill her.<eos> We got to put her down before that thing comes out.<eos> Why is that your solution to everything?<eos> Killing the problem.<eos> I'm sure you like stepping on spiders too.<eos> Well, if the spider has a queen baby inside that's gonna wipe out the entire human race, that kind of spider, yeah, I think I'd kill it.<eos> This cure of yours, you really think it'll work?
- I mean, it's got to detect a... - Okay, Joe, Joe.<eos> Slow down.<eos> I need to know how soon until this thing is working.<eos> I don't know, I-I have a couple big problems to figure out.<eos> Uh, a day or two?<eos> I need you to stall.<eos> What?<eos> No, I-I thought the dome needed to come down before we choked to death.<eos> It-it does, but the Resistance is working on a cure.<eos> We have to see if it'll work before your device does.
I'm not gonna let you hurt my baby.<eos> Have you made up your mind?<eos> Are you going to help us take down the dome?<eos> I don't really have a choice, do I?<eos> Neither of us do.<eos> The real trick'll be doing the calculations necessary to split the amethyst into seven pieces.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> In truth... I'm dying.<eos> My cycle's coming to an end.<eos> Just as it must.
How you feel?<eos> Like I'm on fire.<eos> But... I'm awake.<eos> What do you remember?<eos> All of it.<eos> Thanks for not giving up on me.<eos> You went through the wringer, kid.<eos> A lot tougher than I gave you credit for.<eos> I'm gonna promise you something right now.<eos> When this dome comes down... and it will come down... everything's gonna be different.
I can't believe I'm gonna do this.<eos> I'm helping you deliver your baby with another woman.<eos> I know.<eos> Eva, you need to push.<eos> Push now!<eos> All right.<eos> Okay, keep going.<eos> - Damn it.<eos> - The baby!<eos> Here it comes.
We can't.<eos> Unfortunately, it's only going to get worse.<eos> We need to leave the dome sooner than planned, and we have a lot of work to do before then.<eos> Tell me what to do.<eos> You and Sam help the ill into the beds.<eos> I'll meet you back here in an hour.<eos> Thank God.<eos> I was dying here.<eos> The heat is rising as the dome hardens.<eos> I'd say we have 24 hours left before it seals up completely.
Take the elderly to the lake.<eos> Do what needs to be done.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Someone could see you.<eos> You knew I'd come back for you.<eos> That's why you hung this on the window, right?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Something's wrong with the dome, Joe.<eos> I know.<eos> It's calcifying.
You think I was happy in the Maldives?<eos> It's sinking into the ocean, for God's sake.<eos> Oh, and have I mentioned that while water rose above my ankles,<eos> I started writing another tome?<eos> I'm calling it The Amanda Clarke Story.<eos> It'll be your word against mine.<eos> Think about it.<eos> A book written by a dead man.<eos> People will eat that up.<eos> It's sure to blow the lid off this good-girl image you tricked people into believing.
I should...<eos> Jack.<eos> Come by the beach house later.<eos> Please.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> As soon as I'm done here,<eos> I'm on the next flight back to L.A.<eos> Goodbye, Amanda.<eos> Did you follow up on David Clarke's alibi?<eos> Yeah, it checks out.
A surgical residency is all about training for the worst.<eos> But as prepared as we might be, we usually don't see disaster coming.<eos> We can try to envision the worst-case scenario to foresee catastrophe.<eos> Kepner, where is everyone?<eos> Anyone in particular?<eos> Well, page everyone now.<eos> A plane went down.<eos> A small one, but it crashed right in the middle of the city.

Move it or lose it, ladies!<eos> I need you to be still.<eos> Wilson, I need a little help here.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Shut up!<eos> Grey, need a hand.<eos> I flew a plane.<eos> I had the controls in my hands.<eos> I don't know how to fly a plane, and I flew a freaking plane!<eos> We were in a plane, and it crashed.
Don't move.<eos> He's barely perfusing.<eos> Are you compressing hard enough?<eos> I know how to compress a heart.<eos> Watch my finger.<eos> Okay, Grey, you'd do well to remember who you talking to before you get smacked.<eos> I need a patch, pledgets, and 3-0 prolene.<eos> His tissue's pretty friable.<eos> You sure a patch will hold?<eos> It has to.
What if... what if Shepherd made the wrong call because she's so pissed at Hunt, and Hunt's so pissed at her, and he dies, and Kate doesn't remember any of it?<eos> Like, it never even happened?<eos> Like poof, gone, just evaporated like it was nothing?<eos> I can never look at any of them the same again.<eos> Never.<eos> Yeah, that woman is never gonna find this kind of love again.<eos> Ever.<eos> Hey, who is that?<eos> Where'd you get that baby?<eos> It came flying out of mom two.
Wait here.<eos> Come on<eos> come on, come on.<eos> Whatcha doing?<eos> Arinat that gun.<eos> What do you think?<eos> It's big.<eos> Like your asshole.<eos> You got the money?<eos> Not if it's loaded.
Oh, thank you.<eos> (smacks lips)<eos> (sighs) What's up?<eos> Porsha set up this dumb phone with these stupid-ass alerts, and I can't figure it out.<eos> - Can you fix it?<eos> - Where is she, anyways?<eos> I fired her 'cause she got me arrested.<eos> Now, fix my phone.<eos> (phone beeping)<eos> Uh, it's Lucious.
I need Laviticus.<eos> I lost the venue for my Cookout.<eos> You mean the Cookout you was planning with that dude that kidnapped my son?<eos> I'm serious, Lucious.<eos> I need this.<eos> You must be desperate.<eos> No.<eos> No. The same way I needed you to help me with Swiftstream.<eos> Now, you know that's different.<eos> Our legacy is not up for sale and it shouldn't be up for sale.
But for the record,<eos> Empire would be thrilled to have Skye Summers on its roster.<eos> And Jamal, how excited are you to be working with a multi-platinum-selling artist like Skye Summers?<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> How excited am I?<eos> I'm crazy excited. Are you kidding me?<eos> Skye, I don't want to embarrass you too much, but... y'all, I'm sorry.<eos> I am the "Oh, gee, Skye Summers" fan.<eos> And-and her first CD was the very first CD I ever bought.<eos> You know, I scratched it up till it couldn't play anymore.

I have a fashion show to plan.<eos> - You've a what?<eos> - A fashion show.<eos> My fashion show.<eos> Which just so happens to be on the same night as your fashion show.<eos> Don't be so ridiculous.<eos> You know my event is the pinnacle of Fashion Week.<eos> You'll be setting yourself up for illicit public scrutiny.<eos> Not to mention global ridicule from the press when your show is less than mine.<eos> Mm. Unless, of course, it's more than yours... which it will be.
- I have a novel idea.<eos> How about we tone down the snark and keep this civil?<eos> I don't know about average, but, yes, programmers are our biggest client base.<eos> And yet 80% of Wharf Master's traffic comes from copyrighted music and films.<eos> Uh, nice parsing of numbers, Mr. Agos.<eos> That 80% reflects the number of downloads, not traffic.<eos> And yet our client's movie was downloaded four million times on your site before it opened in theaters.<eos> - 4.2 million.<eos> - 4.2 million times.<eos> So when it finally premiered, the box office was depressed.
Because the cops... they would not believe us.<eos> Why?<eos> They think Alex did something... something bad.<eos> S-something bad?<eos> They think Alex killed someone.<eos> But... but he didn't.<eos> He was framed.<eos> Sarah, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> We always knew this day would come.<eos> Yeah, well, now it's here.
(Mark) disable the compressor.<eos> We knock that out, The pressure in the pipes drops.<eos> But Christoph overrode the compressor.<eos> You won't be able to turn it off, even manually.<eos> We're not gonna turn it off.<eos> We're gonna blow it up.<eos> (Katya) the pressure in the lines is too much.<eos> If we're anywhere near it and we set off a spark, Wouldn't it explode?<eos> The explosion's gonna kill us.<eos> But if we don't blow it up and it hits 750, We're gonna be dead anyway.
Do you see Mr. Scratch?<eos> You can talk now.<eos> I want to know what--<eos> I want to know what you're feeling.<eos> That's my team.<eos> They know I'm here.<eos> They're gonna come looking for me, and if you harm me--<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Your phone isn't ringing.<eos> It was ringing.

He never trusted technology.<eos> He had a paper backup for everything.<eos> Old KGB habits die hard.<eos> Kens... there's a painting in his house of a tree.<eos> See if you can find it.<eos> Painting of a tree?<eos> A tree.<eos> He was always going on and on about the provenance of this painting or that painting...<eos> But he never said squat about the tree.<eos> It was also in a different frame every time I was there.
For fun.<eos> Awesome.<eos> I may have something.<eos> Take a look at this.<eos> I believe the vessel you're looking for left the La Guaira port outside of Caracas yesterday.<eos> I'm still waiting on details from the Venezuelan government.<eos> Mm. Could be waiting on them for a while.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Yes.<eos> It has a transponder.
A guy who took out a mortgage to buy a medallion, and that cab is how he puts food on the table.<eos> Those medallions cost, what, a million dollars now?<eos> They did, but the price is going down thanks to the ride-share companies.<eos> In other cities, it's already bad, and people here see the writing on the wall.<eos> It's like the market for your house dropping out.<eos> A lot of these guys, they're up to their eyeballs in debt, and now... they're underwater.<eos> I'd kill over that.<eos> Hey. Thought you'd still be at the morgue.<eos> Mr. Barrow's body was a disappointment.<eos> It was devoid of any clues as to his killer's identity, so I came here.
They asked him the same question, and he tried to bolt out the back door.<eos> They're bringing him down to the station now.<eos> Gordon Meadows, I'm Detective Bell.<eos> This is Mr. Holmes, Ms. Watson.<eos> We've just been informed that you're a registered sex offender.<eos> You were arrested for trading in child pornography in 2008.<eos> We're curious.<eos> What's your affiliation with Galen Barrow?<eos> Why'd you buy that taxi last week?<eos> It was too old to put into use.
I found it out front when I came back from my run.<eos> - Who said you could open my stuff?<eos> - Force of habit.<eos> At least now I don't have to reseal it and pretend it never happened.<eos> You know what?<eos> Speaking of personal boundaries, you wore my YFB shirt, didn't you?<eos> Me?<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it smells like curry and you love curry, and I hate curry.
We're sharing each other's stuff, and you know what?<eos> I haven't read "Catcher in the Rye" in awhile.<eos> And it is kind of awesome, so can I borrow it?<eos> - No.<eos> - Okay. Baby steps it is.<eos> Do we have any cheese?<eos> Justin Link, 30, died of a massive heart attack after the breakfast rush at his food truck.<eos> - Oh, I love that truck.<eos> - Why?<eos> All it has is ridiculously expensive toast.
- Good.<eos> No one from inside the lab leaked the algorithm.<eos> We've checked and rechecked everyone who works here even people without high-level clearance.<eos> Ayo's apartment was tented for termites.<eos> She was at a friend's house that morning.<eos> And Bob the test tube guy?<eos> He was working out with his trainer.<eos> Dude, I don't get it.<eos> The algorithm only exists in hard copy, only in here.<eos> It didn't just walk out by itself.
Of course I do.<eos> It's the nicest watch I own.<eos> Did you ever fix the clasp?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> How did it break?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> It was years ago.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It broke in the struggle.
Now.<eos> The International Space Program came under fire today when astrophysicist Steve Thomas released information to the media...<eos> The A.L.A.T. Program was intended to be an advanced satellite-warning system using technology designed to detect interstellar bodies...<eos> I have nothing further to say at this moment.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Are you saying you agree with what Thomas did?<eos> All I'm saying is, if the A.L.A.T. was being used as it was intended, instead of spying on us, he wouldn't have had to... Shut down the program while the investigations continue.<eos> I was just trying to save lives.<eos> The asteroid GX210 was expected to pass about 350,000 kilometers from Earth at around 8:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.<eos> It has somehow disappeared, baffling astronomers worldwide.
I want all satellites that still have eyes redirected, and I want operational status on those that were damaged.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hmm.<eos> That's interesting.<eos> What?<eos> Look at the texture.<eos> It's almost... zero porosity.<eos> I've never seen anything like it.<eos> Steve, you're gonna want to see this.<eos> The asteroid GX210 was being tracked by the International Satellite Program when it suddenly disappeared.
I need a strong microscope.<eos> I'm going to go to the lab.<eos> Your lab is on lock-down.<eos> Someone will let me in.<eos> Who?<eos> You alienated everybody you know with your little whistle-blowing stunt.<eos> You stay.<eos> I can get you into a lab at the university.<eos> Yeah?<eos> It's fully loaded.
I'm not.<eos> That wasn't me, I swear.<eos> I know.<eos> We're in.<eos> Are you actually controlling a spy satellite right now?<eos> "Retired" satellite.<eos> We're finally going to use this as it was intended.<eos> What are you doing now?<eos> I'm using the satellite's frequency generator to send out electromagnetic pulses at 2-5 microns.<eos> It's following the same trajectory as the meteor storm.
Russia's about to get hit by a meteor storm, then Berlin, then London.<eos> The meteors will keep getting bigger.<eos> And you know this how?<eos> It's fundamental physics, Phil.<eos> In an asteroid collision, the resulting explosion flings debris further into space.<eos> The rest of GX210 is still coming.<eos> But that's not the worst of it.<eos> Really, and what is?<eos> The second wave of destruction will be the dark asteroid.<eos> It is going to hit somewhere in the continental U.S., and it will be catastrophic.
Print up everything you have.<eos> I need hard copies.<eos> What can I do?<eos> I can...<eos> I can send e-mails, I can save stuff...<eos> I could really use some more coffee.<eos> Great.<eos> I had A.L.A.T. track the dark asteroid's dust residual back to its origin.<eos> It was a Trojan in Jupiter's orbit.<eos> Well, why didn't it stay there?
I could really use some more coffee.<eos> Great.<eos> I had A.L.A.T. track the dark asteroid's dust residual back to its origin.<eos> It was a Trojan in Jupiter's orbit.<eos> Well, why didn't it stay there?<eos> Perturbation.<eos> Competition between the sun's gravitational pull, and Jupiter's created enough orbital energy to fling it into space.<eos> Like a sling-shot?<eos> It's more like a cue ball.<eos> It's hitting every other asteroid in its path, causing these meteor storms with incredible debris velocity.
Now, when I tested the meteorite before... ammonia reacted to trace elements of sodium phosphide.<eos> It caused the sample to expand rapidly.<eos> Acid molecules are ionized water... sodium phosphide is ionic.<eos> The two together should cancel one another out and cause the meteor to shrink.<eos> "Should"?<eos> Yeah, I know it's a long shot, but...<eos> You should stand back.<eos> Whoa!<eos> It's gone!<eos> No, it imploded.
The longer it takes for you to admit it, the worse it's gonna be for you and Diane.<eos> So, I mean, I hate to say this, 'cause I like you, but... if I were you, I'd come clean.<eos> Come on.<eos> Well, you've given this old con law professor a lot to think about.<eos> On the one hand, people have the right to their religious views, and they cannot and should not be barred from the marketplace because of them.<eos> On the other hand, every citizen has the right not to be discriminated against on the basis of their race, their color, their nationality, and yes, their sexual orientation.<eos> Well, given all that, my task is difficult but clear:<eos> I must weigh whether or not a religious accommodation would frustrate the core purpose of antidiscrimination law.<eos> And in this case...<eos> I find that it would.
- Need a lift?<eos> - No.<eos> Come on, Angie... Angela.<eos> Angela.<eos> You know, if you ask really nicely,<eos> I'm sure Saperstein will give you a handy in the supply closet.<eos> Look, not every guy is an asshole.<eos> But you'll never know that if you don't give somebody a chance.<eos> They say that rape is about power, not sex, but that's kind of bullshit.<eos> Of course it's about sex.

You're not going back in?<eos> I've had enough victims for one night.<eos> See you next time, maybe.<eos> What's up, baby girl?<eos> I waited for you all night.<eos> What's the matter, sweetie?<eos> Got something special for you.<eos> Something special?<eos> I hope you've got a tennis bracelet down your pants, 'cause there sure ain't nothing special about your cock.<eos> It is a cock, right?

And she's terrified... terrified that her mom's gonna find out about group.<eos> She thinks she's smoking pot with the neighbor.<eos> How fucked up is that?<eos> A teenager sneaking out of the house for rape counseling.<eos> Shitty rape counseling.<eos> It's just what I'm always saying, you know?<eos> Give a woman a fish and she makes dinner for her piece-of-shit husband.<eos> Teach the woman to kill the piece-of-shit husband, and she never has to make dinner again.<eos> A message of hope.<eos> It's beautiful, really.
Come on now, smart mouth, do something useful with it.<eos> You know you like it rough.<eos> No teeth, showhorse.<eos> No teeth.<eos> That's it.<eos> Not just the tip, sweetie.<eos> Just the tip, sweetie.<eos> This is for Marla, showhorse.<eos> It's like a switch gets thrown.<eos> It just comes out in a rush.
Not for very much longer.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I have a... God, I have a family.<eos> Don't you dare try and use that.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm begging you.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> Yes, you will be.<eos> You don't deserve the lubricant, but it just won't go in otherwise.
So why don't you just leave me out of this?<eos> - You know Ron Merrick?<eos> - I most certainly do not.<eos> Oh, I think you do.<eos> You threatened him the other night.<eos> - I did no such thing.<eos> - Right here in group.<eos> Something about a pipe.<eos> Mmm, does that ring any bells, Mr. Kosca?<eos> - "Koza!" It's "Koza." - Oscar.
You all right?<eos> Yeah?<eos> - You up for a few questions?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Great.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's see.<eos> - The knife was yours, right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> The Taser I'm not sure about because it had your fingerprints on it as well as his.

Yes.<eos> We weren't about to pull the plug on an operation we'd planned for so long<eos> It was decided that Marsh was now a threat to the operation, which had to be eliminated...<eos> She's using a passive voice.<eos> Distancing herself from it.<eos> JULIET: Yes. HENDRICKS:<eos> Using information you acquired...<eos> He's a "threat." Not a person.<eos> Her time in Baghdad changed her.<eos> It might have changed me.
Me too.<eos> So...<eos> You find whatever it is you were looking for outside of Michigan?<eos> You can say it. - My parents.<eos> - So you find them?<eos> No, I found nothing.<eos> I...<eos> Give up the necklace, bitch. Here, here!<eos> 58 dollars inside.<eos> It's yours!
Good for morale.<eos> I told them to get a margarita but stay on call.<eos> Because an attack can happen at any time.<eos> Isn't that right?<eos> She just gave me our final destination.<eos> She's in Brooklyn.<eos> We're running out of time, Harry.<eos> We can only go just so fast, Ms. Groves.<eos> - This thing has eight cylinders.<eos> - But I sincerely doubt it can fly.
You must be thirsty after that long drive.<eos> Have they still got those roadworks up at Long Croft?<eos> No, they've moved onto Ash Lane now.<eos> There's temporary traffic lights, but unless you're doing the school run, it's not too bad.<eos> Mm. So did you forgo the pleasures of the A352?<eos> Yes, I tend to take that cut-through on Meadowbank now.<eos> It's always quieter. Ah, good.<eos> Good.<eos> So, about this cake...<eos> If you could give me a hand, it is quite heavy.
I remember Magistrate Hale talking of the West Indies... warm waters and soft beaches everywhere you turn.<eos> No mercy or pox.<eos> What a sweet dream.<eos> One that we don't have to wait for sleep to see true.<eos> Dollie, I've got means.<eos> Your money?<eos> I heard them talk about it in the clinic.<eos> Where did you get it?<eos> I earned it.<eos> It's mine.
You're wasting your time.<eos> Most murders come out of intimate personal conflict.<eos> I loved my husband.<eos> You find that hard to imagine.<eos> Are you married, Inspector?<eos> No.<eos> You're still young.<eos> Are you in love?<eos> Hmm. The older one is then the one realises how strange love is.<eos> How many different forms it takes.

I'm ready to go.<eos> Oh. Careful.<eos> Sorry.<eos> All right. See you.<eos> You have some coconut ice cream, okay?<eos> A team of volunteers discovered the remains while cleaning up after a fire in George Washington National Park.<eos> I heard it took firefighters nearly three days to put out the blaze.<eos> Isn't he supposed to be black?<eos> Well, the fire retardant that they use is called red slurry.<eos> It's a mixture of water and ammonium phosphate.
Take it down a notch,<eos> Mr. Bray, this isn't the end zone.<eos> Have you figured out what caused the injury?<eos> A very wide V-shaped incision, meaning the weapon was most likely a wide-angle blade.<eos> There are similar nicks to the left side ribs five and six, as well as the right humerus.<eos> The width of that kerf mark is a lot narrower than the incision on the femur.<eos> And the dimensions of the incision on the humerus are different than the incisions on the ribs and femur.<eos> Meaning our victim could have been stabbed with three separate blades.<eos> So the artist was telling the truth.<eos> Micah received a call before he ran out, but it was from a burner cell.
Kaali!<eos> Who is Kaali.<eos> King remember the boy from the garage we beat up.<eos> He has a big brother.<eos> It could be him.<eos> How can it be him?<eos> It can't be him<eos> Nothing wrong in checking.<eos> Let's go take a look.<eos> What is it?
You and your pervert ideas.<eos> Pinto, wrap the boot.<eos> It's a nice film.<eos> I've seen it myself.<eos> Brother, there's a bag in here.<eos> Whose bag is this?<eos> I guess it Mani bhai's.<eos> This isn't my bag.<eos> - What?<eos> Then whose bag is it?
I know it is fashionable to believe it is a metaphor, but it is not.<eos> It is real.<eos> A place of infinite misery and torment.<eos> The Final Judgement could be just days away, Celine.<eos> You have picked a terrible moment to break your vow of chastity.<eos> - At least go to Confession.<eos> - I don't want to repent.<eos> I love him.<eos> How can love be bad?<eos> It isn't.
What's the problem?<eos> I checked the Navy Locator.<eos> There's no listing for a Petty Officer Daniel Harvey anywhere in the Navy's record.<eos> Someone needs to tell him that.<eos> Abby examined the I.D.<eos> If it's a forgery, it's a really good one.<eos> And no hits on his prints.<eos> Vehicle's legit-- it's registered to the Department of Defense's motor pool.<eos> Who checked it out?<eos> According to their records, it's still sitting in the garage.
That is... awesome!<eos> So?<eos> So I'm just thrilled.<eos> You got someone to run DNA for you.<eos> Someone with a lab full of DNA-running equipment.<eos> I mean, it must be so cool to know somebody like that.<eos> Abby, it's not like that.<eos> You cheated on me, Gibbs.<eos> Abby, the DNA was in the southeast field office when I was assigned the op.<eos> It would've run through too many hands to get up here to you.
Triggered by the actions of a notorious gangster over 800 miles away named Al Capone.<eos> Al Capone is a Brooklyn gangster who fled to Chicago, and Chicago was a much rougher city than New York.<eos> And he operated very well in that environment...<eos> But, he didn't have the tempering influence of a Meyer Lansky , who could say to Luciano,<eos> "this is stupid."<eos> He would do things very much out in the public. Very much in the face of law enforcement.<eos> But on February 14th, 1929,<eos> Capone goes too far, ordering the brutal execution of rival Chicago gangsters.<eos> More than 150 shots are fired, in what becomes known as one of the bloodiest days in Mafia history, the Saint Valentine's day massacre.<eos> The Saint Valentine's Day massacre is so incredible, it gets attention.
That is so true.<eos> The energy has been drained from it... completely.<eos> I believe something has happened to Abraham... something dire.<eos> Now, if something has happened to the Horseman of Death, it means there are dark forces in motion.<eos> First things first.<eos> I need to get you out of here.<eos> So tell me what you tried to smuggle past Customs.<eos> An artifact.<eos> One of immeasurable significance.<eos> I believe it holds the key to our future as Witnesses,
I have come to value the concord I found with my fellow detainees.<eos> You want to stay with your new pals?<eos> Good God, no.<eos> Told you!<eos> I can't miss.<eos> - Oh, dude, that was me.<eos> - Oh, the hell it was.<eos> God, why do you got to be like that?<eos> Why does it always got to be you?<eos> Well, because you couldn't hit an elephant if it was hugging you.
In Luke 14, Jesus says,<eos> "When you give a feast," invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, "and you will be blessed."<eos> Now it's time we open our doors to those who can't repay.<eos> The poor, the addicted, and the afflicted.<eos> - Amen?<eos> - Amen.<eos> Do you feel God's love?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I know you do.<eos> Now I remember walking into this building when it was rat and roach infested.
Talk about PJ?<eos> Actually, I think this goes deeper than that.<eos> You're focusing on the wrong thing.<eos> Well, what the fuck should I be focusing on?<eos> Well, why don't you tell me, Pernell?<eos> Who are you really mad at?<eos> Julio.<eos> You have to bring him back.<eos> I think it starts with figuring out where to put all of the anger.<eos> Put the body where it belongs.
Samaritan has found the machine.<eos> If that were true we'd all be dead.<eos> What happened, Miss Groves?<eos> Turns out the People's Republic is surprisingly lax on full-body searches.<eos> - How goes you gang war, Harry?<eos> - Dangerous.<eos> I'm afraid it's only a matter of time before Dominic retaliates.<eos> Might be sooner than you think.<eos> You getting this number, Finch?<eos> It's actually two numbers, Mr. Reese.
And that's what's gonna keep Walter at Scorpion where he belongs.<eos> That guy is going down the hall on a hoverboard!<eos> Hey. Don't look.<eos> Don't be seduced.<eos> Happy should be in position by now.<eos> What the hell?<eos> I need that VIN number of the bribe on wheels you gave Walter O'Brien.<eos> I'm in the middle of a meeting.<eos> And I'm in the middle of your conference table.<eos> You stuck your nose where it didn't belong, looking to break apart the only family some of us have ever known.
She did. She brought her story and all her evidence she collected to justice.<eos> - When was this, John?<eos> - Summer of 2005.<eos> Well, there was a hearing.<eos> All the evidence was confiscated, and the woman who brought the case... Brenda Pelton... Well, they hit her with a bogus treason charge.<eos> Obviously to discredit her.<eos> And then she had to go underground to avoid arrest.<eos> The antidote that her parents made, has anyone ever seen it?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> Maybe it's with all the other evidence they collected.
I-it's not!<eos> No!<eos> We can't have a new baby!<eos> We're the babies.<eos> Mom says my butt is as soft as a baby's bottom.<eos> But compared to a real baby, it'll seem like turtle skin.<eos> Turtle skin is actually very soft.<eos> Why are you fighting me on this?<eos> I'm not the enemy.<eos> It's the unborn monster in mommy's tummy.
Definitely have a rat problem.<eos> Remember the other day when you made that big plate of bacon and it disappeared before the kids came down?<eos> Oh.<eos> Rats!<eos> I think you're right.<eos> You do?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh.<eos> There's obviously a rat in the house.<eos> It's a big, fat, pork-eating rat.
Oh, my God.<eos> - Vivid, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Wow.<eos> But, honestly, Dre, we're not that much better.<eos> Huh?<eos> Why didn't you talk to me?<eos> Because I was afraid that you would be mad that I wasn't locked into our plan... you know, four kids, a vasectomy.<eos> You know, everybody out of the house by the time we're 50.<eos> It's a good plan.
And we're always getting donations of old toys that we barely use.<eos> Steph?<eos> Oh...<eos> Shovels and sand and a pickaxe. They're not really required at school.<eos> I could provide sand... and a couple of shovels, but we've not got a spare pickaxe.<eos> Well, I'll see what Thumbs can dig out.<eos> Pun intended.<eos> Do you have an idea where the shelter might be located?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But we're having a little fun establishing where it... won't be.
I'm sure I don't need to remind you that our lifestyle is a lifestyle worth preserving.<eos> Because if the Monarchy goes down, we all go down with it.<eos> Luckily for you, tonight the only thing going down are your servers.<eos> After four hours, seek medical attention.<eos> Most of these men are happy enough with a common whore, but as for me, I prefer my whores to be... uncommon.<eos> Go to my room and wait for me.<eos> And, remember, enthusiasm counts.<eos> Phantogram's new album is awesome.<eos> If you like that, you should go back and listen to their EP.<eos> It's way underrated.
LIVs?<eos> I remember those guys.<eos> They tipped.<eos> - And that's memorable?<eos> - During spring break it is.<eos> And they were old, like at least 40.<eos> Okay, do you remember anything else about these guys?<eos> Just that they hit on every girl at the bar at least once.<eos> - Hey, I love your bikini.<eos> It would look great on the floor of my crazy expensive hotel suite. I'm sure.
Dad?<eos> Could I see you for a second?<eos> Anything?<eos> We checked his luggage.<eos> No gun, no device, nothing that speaks to terrorism.<eos> Look, state can confirm the story about the sick mother, but part of Haddad's story checks out.<eos> Turns out that air marshal Ford had a second phone on the flight.<eos> It was his personal cell.<eos> Well, we didn't find a second phone on the body.<eos> Well, if it had evidence on it, it's possible the killer removed it.
We obviously had a situation, but we have it under control.<eos> I'm telling you, this is some kind of mistake.<eos> That gun is not mine.<eos> What was your plan, Marilyn?<eos> Take hostages, try to bring down the plane?<eos> Bring down the plane?<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> I'm talking about the suit you lost against Oceanic, and the threatening texts you sent from this phone.<eos> That is not my phone.<eos> It was in your purse, paid for with your credit card.
Yes, I was.<eos> You didn't see me, but I saw you.<eos> - And you just left me there?<eos> - Well, you seemed... fine.<eos> In a leper colony?<eos> No matter... you're here now.<eos> - We should celebrate.<eos> - Oh, no, this isn't a visit, I've got a job to do.<eos> I'm here looking for an alien object which has no business being here on Earth in 1651.<eos> It was just... It just so happened, you know, that my tracking device, it led me to the carriage that you were, you know, robbing.
You can help me.<eos> - With what?<eos> - Packing.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's a big place for someone who lives on their own.<eos> I have a servant.<eos> And all manner of visitors drop in.<eos> Your device... what is it?<eos> My curioscanner?<eos> Oh, it, er, it sort of scans for...

I love you.<eos> I always will.<eos> I did love George.<eos> George?<eos> George, it's Sarah.<eos> Stay back!<eos> George, try and stay awake.<eos> What happened?<eos> Rene!<eos> The gun, it went off!
- but what about everyone else?<eos> - I bet you'd go to London too.<eos> I probably would, but I shouldn't have to.<eos> And what about people who don't have that option?<eos> So the battle lines are drawn and now we must fight it out.<eos> Well, I'm glad we're to be allies.<eos> I must be going.<eos> I assume old Lady Grantham is still bitterly opposed?<eos> Of course, so there'll be wigs on the green before we're done.<eos> So be it. Wigs on the green it is.
We'll let you know.<eos> - How did the visit go?<eos> - Well, George wants to be a pig farmer when he grows up.<eos> - And Mr Drewe's well?<eos> - He's so proud of his animals.<eos> Was Mrs Drewe there?<eos> You're full of questions.<eos> To be honest, she was quite upset at seeing Marigold again.<eos> I thought it would be a nice gesture but, perhaps, I was being insensitive.<eos> When a woman loves a child, it must stay with her.
- Now?<eos> - She's just outside.<eos> Very well.<eos> Thank you for seeing me, milady.<eos> I'm happy to, Daisy, but I must tell you right off,<eos> - there's nothing more I can do.<eos> - I just can't bear it for our William's dad to be thrown out of his farm when it's all my fault.<eos> To start with, I don't think it is your fault.<eos> Mr Henderson was angry, but he wouldn't change his plans for that and the truth is, they are taking a lot of the estate in hand.<eos> But Mr Mason's not young and it needs someone that knows him.
It's a big undertaking.<eos> Why?<eos> Have you thought of something?<eos> - You've had an idea, haven't you?<eos> - Probably not.<eos> Well, maybe.<eos> I'll let you know if anything comes of it.<eos> Thank you, Your Ladyship.<eos> It's no mystery, Mrs Bates, you suffer from cervical incompetence.<eos> To put it plainly, the neck of the womb is weak and as the foetus reaches three or four months, it becomes too heavy to be supported.
Holy crap.<eos> Close your mouth, kid.<eos> T'evgin. Where is he?<eos> You're healing well.<eos> I need to talk to T'evgin right now.<eos> I believe you're back to normal.<eos> It is rude to stare.<eos> What brings you here, Lawkeeper?<eos> You got a ship in orbit, right?<eos> It has a name.
Dani confronted Zuber... there was something wrong with the study.<eos> Something worth killing her for.<eos> The only way to find out what's going on in that lab is a private session with Zuber, unless anyone has any better ideas.<eos> Fine. I will allow it... Under one condition.<eos> Did you guys see the death stare that Kirsten gave Maggie when she told her she had to wear a wire?<eos> And Maggie was just looking out for her.<eos> Okay. By hearing what's going on in there, we'll be able to know if Kirsten is in trouble.<eos> The agency really outdid itself.<eos> We've got a backscatter X-ray infotech, an infrared vibration receiver, oh, and this baby here it's called a blowfish.<eos> It acts like a cell phone tower.
It's existed since Roswell.<eos> And it's been in use, being used on humans in human testing, the taking of men, women and children that's misreported as alien abductions.<eos> - So you believe you have the how.<eos> - Yes.<eos> And I think I know the why.<eos> The why is more complicated than you may ever know, Mr. Mulder.<eos> 60 years ago, we were warned about the military industrial complex gathering too much power.<eos> This is old news.<eos> The countdown has begun.<eos> It began in 2012, but no one knew.
I'm Laurie.<eos> Would you like to join us?<eos> Resurrection?<eos> That's the claim from Australia as witnesses describe a man previously believed dead emerging from a cave in Wanneroo outside the city of Perth.<eos> Walked out covered in mozzie bites, saying he'd just been in a hotel.<eos> The man, identified as David Burton...<eos> I made you a grilled cheese.<eos> Jill texted you.<eos> You went through my phone?<eos> It was lying right there and it buzzed, and I couldn't help it.
- Did she take my letter? - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she did.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - The door's padlocked. They threw us out.<eos> They put all the stuff in the hallway. - No.<eos> - Where am I gonna stay?<eos> We can meet at our apartment.<eos> We'll figure this out, okay?<eos> - Has anybody seen my laptop?<eos> - Are you sure it was in there, Mom? Yes, Tom.
Oh, yeah. Warmer.<eos> You're getting real hot now, Kevin.<eos> Oh, you're on goddamn fire.<eos> Don't get in that car, Kevin!<eos> You still here, man?<eos> Yeah, I just...<eos> I lost my phone when I was out here earlier today.<eos> Find it?<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> It's bricked, so...
Even you have your limits.<eos> For the last twelve years I hid who I was.<eos> I don't have to anymore.<eos> And I don't want to waste a minute of it.<eos> Besides, this sounds like a job for Supergirl.<eos> (SIRENS BLARING)<eos> (EXPLOSIONS)<eos> What can I do, Chief?<eos> That ship's holding almost a million barrels of crude oil.<eos> If the fire reaches it, it's gonna go off like a two ton bomb.
- (SIRENS BLARING) - (VEHICLES HONKING)<eos> ASTRA:<eos> You're bleeding.<eos> Human beings are so fragile.<eos> It's amazing any of you make it out of infancy.<eos> Alura...<eos> How do you know that name?<eos> I saw a hologram of you.<eos> A message from Krypton.<eos> It was on the ship that brought your daughter to Earth.
This is his first.<eos> Water?<eos> Oh, yes, please, Gladys.<eos> You know what's crazy?<eos> I feel like I was sitting on the toilet the last time I met you.<eos> That is crazy.<eos> No, that's déjà vu.<eos> That's the mind taking an event you're experiencing in the present moment and mistaking it for a memory.<eos> The mind.<eos> You cannot trust the mind, for it will play tricks on you.
And I'm thinking to myself,<eos> "Shit, now I'm gonna have to kiss that thing because that's what one must endure if you want to get elected."<eos> So I pucker up and you know what that young man does?<eos> He hands me the baby and he just walks away.<eos> He gave me his child and he disappeared.<eos> Police couldn't find him.<eos> No wife or mother stepped forward to claim it.<eos> And that baby is now in an orphanage and it's gonna be fine.<eos> It's gonna be fine.<eos> It's gonna grow up and it's gonna have difficulty attaching to people and it's gonna have difficulty giving and accepting love.
No, ma'am.<eos> I'm gonna stop John and retrieve the Geryon.<eos> Last time I checked, I give the orders around here, unless something has changed.<eos> This situation is a clear and present danger to the security of the United States.<eos> I decide what's a threat to this country, and from everything I've learned lately,<eos> - that would be you.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> You've been lying to me, Malcolm.<eos> This program isn't everything that you said it was.<eos> This program is everything it can be.
"Richard III"?<eos> Really, Mr. President?<eos> If you're gonna tell me that I don't have enemies, save your breath.<eos> We both know that that's not true.<eos> What's true is that Volker came at you with everything he had, and you survived.<eos> You call this surviving, sitting here in this chair, stuck here like this for months?<eos> Maybe longer?<eos> You don't have to stand up to lead.<eos> Good, because I can't.<eos> Franklin Delano Roosevelt took on the Nazis, ended the depression, and pulled this nation back together when it was splintering apart.
Why are you here?<eos> I was worried about you.<eos> I did some digging.<eos> What is it?<eos> Okay, you're not gonna be happy.<eos> I spoke to a military contact.<eos> Apparently, special ops soldiers don't carry cell phones, at least not on missions.<eos> So?<eos> So the email allegedly sent by Odelle Ballard doesn't exist.<eos> It never existed.
And now begins the ancient word.<eos> The sun sleeps below the sky, and the world turns upside down.<eos> In the night, we make our feast.<eos> For centuries I danced for them, the blood-gatherer, the bringer of souls.<eos> I've brought them the lost ones, the troubled ones, the desperate ones.<eos> Now I am free, and the world turns upside down again.<eos> They are thirsty for revenge, and nothing will stop them.<eos> No boundaries, no borders.<eos> They will come for me, but I am coming for them.<eos> Their empire of blood will fall, and I will not rest until it all burns.
Straining, wanting to break.<eos> We traveled so far... to find the New World.<eos> You went on your own journey, across an ocean of sand... with your substitute father and your sister.<eos> They didn't know what you were capable of, what you could become.<eos> And this is how you come to kill me?<eos> Like a coward?<eos> You can't even look me in the eye.<eos> Go.<eos> Go find a new ocean to cross.<eos> Now, it might bend you and it may break you... but you will learn what you need to know.
It's unfortunate if you've given them the impression that we approve of the plan.<eos> But I do approve of it.<eos> And you're the fount of wisdom on this topic!<eos> I don't claim to know more than any of you.<eos> I'm glad you don't claim to know more than I do, Lady Grantham.<eos> - But I am disappointed.<eos> - And we know why. If we don't, I gather we will soon.<eos> I'm afraid you see the new arrangement as diminishing your own importance.<eos> - What? - You're the king of this place.<eos> But once it's a wing of the Royal Yorkshire, you'll be one more local doctor.
Alex, are you okay?<eos> Good work, Alex.<eos> Looks like you and I make a pretty good team.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Kill him! Kill Gabriel now!<eos> Patience, Alex.<eos> Patience.<eos> So what do you think of this body of mine?<eos> It's all right, isn't it?<eos> Think it suits me.
And now none of us need to worry, right?<eos> You need to go.<eos> But... you're making up stories 'cause you got too much time on your hands.<eos> So go home, open a book, and act like a normal law student for once.<eos> But...<eos> If Rebecca talks to the police, we all go down.<eos> You're gonna take care of it?<eos> You think I'm gonna whack Rebecca?<eos> It's Laurel.<eos> She's always sticking her head where it doesn't belong, asking questions that don't concern her.
Travis says we're the lucky ones.<eos> He would throw those dudes a parade if they would let him.<eos> And look, we are grateful to our saviors, to the ones who protect us, to those who know when it's feeding time at the zoo.<eos> There's nothing you'll ever take that nature won't take back.<eos> It all belongs to her again.<eos> And the dogs and the dead, and the...<eos> Hello!<eos> We have to repaint the family room.<eos> We did it last week.<eos> I know. It needs a new coat.
And in the room a chair, just like this one where you sit.<eos> This is where they bring me.<eos> I was young.<eos> The man with the blade and the man in the chair, they're not different.<eos> They both suffer.<eos> Their lives are changed forever.<eos> They bring me in and they give me a choice. Which man will I be?<eos> Please.<eos> Please stop.<eos> This word, it's used many times in your radio transmissions, so I know it's important.
My brother always trusted you.<eos> I am honoured.<eos> I don't believe I know what it feels like.<eos> This must be frightening for her and for those who love her.<eos> We are all of us in sickness here.<eos> We're just waiting for it to take root.<eos> She cannot possibly be treated in the king's chamber!<eos> She must be moved immediately!<eos> What if the poison were to spread?<eos> So it is poison?
You never understood politics or survival.<eos> The state is a person, and a person either asserts himself or is subjugated to the will of others.<eos> We stake our claim or we are ploughed into the field.<eos> It is one or the other. - You acted out of pride.<eos> I risked my life for your vanity to rescue your wife's dowry.<eos> I acted for France because I am France, because without me, this country will consume itself in noble squabbles!<eos> Music, dance, art, fashion, all of these things have the power to change a nation from within, to affect the hearts and minds of people, to bring them over to us.<eos> We could never invade the entire world, but the world can imagine us to be their centre, and one day, my brother, they will.<eos> The cost is justified a hundredfold!<eos> If I were to teach you a piece of music, if it were to strike you in your heart, and the sheets and the staves were burned, you might then play it from memory to a salon of a hundred.
Never come for a visit empty-handed.<eos> So where are we?<eos> We're in Algeria, about an hour from Sassel Beach.<eos> It's my home away from home.<eos> Only accessible by boat or plane.<eos> Perfect for my purposes.<eos> Last stop before Europe.<eos> That's right.<eos> I have a boat.<eos> It travels to Spain every few days.
The responsibility for the girl and all her actions lies with you.<eos> Trade Minister.<eos> I apologize.<eos> I have caused you embarrassment.<eos> I should have told you that the Kempeitai had questioned me, and I will resign.<eos> Or you will dismiss me.<eos> No. In life there are too many questions with a lack of time to answer them.<eos> You may not understand this.<eos> I live by a 5,000-year-old book.<eos> I ask it questions as if it were alive.

Thank you.<eos> The pistol is our prized possession.<eos> Colt .44 from 1860.<eos> Issued to the Union Army.<eos> Boys in blue brought it into the second Bull Run.<eos> Please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So tell me, how do you verify what's real from any fakes?<eos> I have a practiced eye.<eos> What a wonderful sense of history it exudes.
Just, uh... just there's something different about this one.<eos> - Different how?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> So, uh, how...<eos> You think she knows more about the film<eos> - than she's saying?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Sorry.<eos> She just said it was different, sir.
This sub...<eos> You've beaten them before.<eos> You'll sink it this time.<eos> Don't you dare make me raise this child by myself.<eos> That will not happen.<eos> I'll see you soon.<eos> Figures the one time you don't go with the land team, all the action's gonna be on the ship.<eos> The cure's the thing.<eos> Whatever happens,<eos> I know you'll get it where it needs to go.
Do you think grandpa blames you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What do you want to drink with dinner?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Oh, this is a full-spectrum camera.<eos> It's very high resolution.<eos> It can reveal things that can't be seen with the naked eye.<eos> I think you might have wasted Ivan's money.<eos> I read Mr. Van Owen's book last night.<eos> He says a spirit will not appear on any camera unless it chooses to do so.
Your mom's right.<eos> If we wouldn't have looked at it when he was here,<eos> - we shouldn't do it now.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> You want us to go into your room and start going through your stuff?<eos> I didn't think so.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Hey! Just in time.<eos> The computer's decoded a whole new flood of images.<eos> It's learning at an exponential rate.
He'd tell her what I'm doing.<eos> Not if I ask him not to.<eos> You trust him?<eos> Completely.<eos> Samantha, I didn't know you were still here.<eos> I just wanted to make sure that the surgery went well.<eos> The heart was okay?<eos> No complications?<eos> The heart was perfect.<eos> It did everything it was supposed to.
What do you mean?<eos> His frame of mind.<eos> Did he seem normal to you?<eos> Perfectly normal.<eos> Did he indicate what his report would have said?<eos> Of course not.<eos> But he would have approved it.<eos> How can you be so sure?<eos> This dam is vitally important.<eos> It will provide hydroelectric power, irrigation, and drinking water for millions of people.

Well, do you have any idea who may have been involved?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You can take your pick from the corporatocracy you're all paid to protect.<eos> And let me tell you something:<eos> Roberto was a warrior against injustice.<eos> These injustices that your husband warred against, they included the re-routing of the Sava River?<eos> - Especially that.<eos> - Why?<eos> That dam they're building will rape the environment.<eos> It will ruin thousands of lives.
Second, you refer to the Prince Regent as His Royal Highness, Prince Liam.<eos> Third, you need to shut that little whore of a mouth of yours before I shut it for good.<eos> I told my father everything.<eos> Well, Daddy can't always protect you.<eos> Just ask your mother.<eos> How can you be so horrible?<eos> As opposed to what?<eos> Being nice?<eos> Nice is for the simple and ignorant who muddle through their ordinary lives, telling themselves their big break is coming, or love is just around the corner.<eos> It's not.

The King was attacked.<eos> The people don't want to hear about love.<eos> The people always want to hear about love.<eos> They want their Queen to be honest and raw and vulnerable.<eos> They want to see you as one of them.<eos> I'm the Queen of England.<eos> You are now, but once upon a time, you were simply a young girl who placed the duties of her family before her own heart's desire.<eos> Eventually, your heart got the better of you and you slipped.<eos> I was married to the King by then - and we had a son.<eos> The heart wants what it wants.
- I need you to get me something.'<eos> - Under my vanity?<eos> In my room?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where you kept your drugs for weeks.<eos> Yes, thank you, but it's my room and they're my drugs.<eos> Just hold on.<eos> - A gun. - 'Yeah.<eos> Be careful.<eos> The safety's on, but it's loaded.'
But... we can be happy here, too.<eos> You're not staying?<eos> We have our own destiny, Ophelia.<eos> No matter what we tell ourselves.<eos> But you're not the heir to the throne anymore.<eos> What happened on that phone call?<eos> What changed everything?<eos> This pendant.<eos> It's not mine.<eos> I don't know how it got here or what it means.
Andnow begins the ancient word, the sun sleeps below the sky, and the world turns upside down.<eos> In the night, we make our feast.<eos> For centuries I danced for them, the blood-gatherer, the bringer of souls.<eos> I brought them the lost ones, the troubled ones, the desperate ones.<eos> Now I am free... and the world turns upside down again.<eos> They are thirsty for revenge, and nothing will stop them.<eos> No boundaries, no borders.<eos> They will come for me, but I am coming for them.<eos> Their empire of blood will fall, and I will not rest until it all burns.
- Where are we on finding him?<eos> - Hasn't turned up yet.<eos> His car's in his garage, no hits on plane, bus, or train tickets, he must be hiding out somewhere in town.<eos> What's that?<eos> And do not tell me it's the cold case files.<eos> It's the cold case files.<eos> I wanted you looking over the files, not taking over the case.<eos> I didn't sign the form.<eos> See, that's weird.<eos> It looked signed.
Lot of late shifts, but it's steady.<eos> No. Thanks anyway.<eos> Our lawyers advised us to sue immediately, but we're holding off pending your cooperation.<eos> That number represents two years of our overhead plus treble damages.<eos> I only took this meeting because, as a former client, I thought you deserved an explanation.<eos> That's sort of like a ransom note after the victim's already dead.<eos> I prefer transformed.<eos> Some ideas need a larger ecosystem.<eos> Give a buffalo a million acres, it thrives.<eos> Stick it on a desert island, in four generations, - it's the size of a poodle.
You are looking the worse for wear, Gabriel.<eos> You did this.<eos> Well, the drugs helped, and the power of suggestion, but uh-huh, it was me.<eos> Did you enjoy yourself?<eos> Mmm, carpe diem has always been my motto.<eos> But you also proved the point of our little adventure.<eos> Do you know what it is?<eos> Oh, I wouldn't hazard a guess.<eos> Well, while your body may be strong, your mind is malleable.<eos> It can't take the same rigors as your physical form.

Mcgee: Oh, look what I found.<eos> Tactical knife.<eos> Could you please change?<eos> The smell is unbearable. You're referring to my suit, huh?<eos> Well...<eos> Consider it a new form of torture. You're a fan of that.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> No need to play coy, qasim. We found your prints at the crime scene.<eos> And your knife Is being analyzed in our lab.<eos> Only a matter of time before it comes back as a match To the one used to kill captain landis.
Last known cartel member, but I'm not so sure that he's our killer.<eos> Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs.<eos> What do you got, Abbs?<eos> Ensign Wilt was not in this car alone.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> It's hard to see... but there is a glove print on this handle that has our girl's blood on it.<eos> She ran a red light with a knife to her throat.<eos> Got any idea when he got in there?<eos> As far as we know, the sadistic creep could have been hiding back here the whole time, till he decided to finish her off and jump out.<eos> What you're collecting's gonna tell us who it is?
Uh, it is a... it is a business computer.<eos> What about it?<eos> More specifically, it's about remote access to it obtained by... this woman,<eos> Ensign Janine Wilt.<eos> Never saw her before.<eos> And no one has access to my computer but me.<eos> It's for business only.<eos> Right. We-we got that.<eos> But you think maybe it's possible she could have gotten in without your knowledge?<eos> No. No, it's quite secure, and I would know if someone were tampering.
I got folders that won't open.<eos> I got it.<eos> Interesting.<eos> They're both protected by the same firewalls<eos> Ensign Wilt used on her laptop.<eos> We'll consider that her signature.<eos> Any way to see what's in them?<eos> I've conquered this dungeon before, but this time, I have dragon arrows.<eos> Skyrim.<eos> Okay, one folder's empty, but it held an e-mail account that's been deleted.
Okay, so, first of all, I would bet that the weapon was most certainly a bayonet.<eos> It was dull, it was old, not quite an antique.<eos> What?<eos> Not quite?<eos> Well, these mold spores found inside the wound-- they're dried up, they're practically mummified.<eos> I'm guessing maybe 50 years old.<eos> That's a pretty specific guess.<eos> Well, it's based on a specific fungus.<eos> Aflatoxin B-One is commonly found in deep-water rice paddies, and they're grown in the Mekong Delta.<eos> It's off a Vietnamese bayonet.
She goes with me every time I leave the building and go outside.<eos> But we'll get back to her in a minute.<eos> First, I want to talk to you about my friend Emilio Evans.<eos> He works for the Crestwell Historical Society in DC.<eos> What about him?<eos> He has a perfectly symmetrical face.<eos> Kind of blows my mind.<eos> And he has access to a lot of useful historical documents.<eos> What'd you find?<eos> When Samar bought the building, it was in shambles.
Look, the-the agents won't tell me what happened exactly, and... I have so many questions.<eos> It's kind of my fault. My parents, uh, your son... they're all gone now, and I didn't do anything to stop it.<eos> You didn't kill them, Luke.<eos> I know, but I...<eos> Look, I better go.<eos> Luke, please.<eos> Tell me about your friends.<eos> They're not my friends.<eos> Then tell me how to find them.<eos> Titanium is generally preferred because it's lightweight and can withstand high compression and temperature.
Wait.<eos> Could the combo platter also cause anger, rage?<eos> I'm sorry, what's your question?<eos> Could Cade's intoxicated state inspire him to strangle Windi?<eos> Sebastian, we're all just doing our jobs.<eos> Yeah, well, mine sucks, okay?<eos> Lasalle's gonna hate me.<eos> It's all right, Sebastian.<eos> The med itself has intense side effects.<eos> Uh, when combined with alcohol, yes, it could cause violent behavior.
got excited there about the journals.<eos> Keep talking.<eos> I began to keep a journal.<eos> I'm going to ignore that.<eos> There were anomalies everywhere.<eos> And the more I looked, the more I saw.<eos> Fascinating.<eos> What did you say your name was?<eos> Shmebulock... senior.<eos> It was finally a place where I felt at home, but something nagged at me.
Oh, no, it's alright.<eos> 'Spencer? '<eos> Spencer?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> So if Charles died in Radley it would say it in his patient file?<eos> - Yeah. - What if he was released?<eos> It would be noted there too.<eos> So if we get that file, we get the truth.<eos> Assuming it still exists, it could be confetti by now.
And it would be great if you could too.<eos> That.... may not happen overnight.<eos> Mona's complicated. Okay?<eos> But she is not the real monster here.<eos> That person hasn't been caught yet.<eos> Maybe you're right .but I still can't help but wonder if that .<eos> Radley place helped Mona or made her worse.<eos> Well, she's not the only one.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> That nut house may have closed down but it still holds all the answers.
Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Camille, what is it?<eos> There's a rat in here.<eos> Oh, okay, that's all?<eos> There are two things in the world that terrify me.<eos> Rats and hairy backs.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God, it's touching me.<eos> It's disgusting and it's touching me with its rat teeth and its rat fur covered in rat diseases.
The playground?<eos> Forget it.<eos> Sports? Cameron's too fragile for that.<eos> They thought if I exerted myself, it would kill me.<eos> So this scar is a constant reminder of how fragile life is.<eos> And how fragile my parents thought I was.<eos> Well, I think that you have proven them wrong several times over.<eos> Dr. Barmal killed herself to stop the virus spreading, right?<eos> She assumed the virus would die with her.<eos> Yeah, and it did.

- You're just getting that now?<eos> - Crank the heat.<eos> Who are you calling?<eos> Fisher, it's me.<eos> No, no, there's no cake yet.<eos> We need your help.<eos> Please tell me you're not afraid of heights.<eos> I've never wanted to dive into the fish tank so badly.<eos> Cooling down would defeat the purpose of what we're trying to do.<eos> With the temperature this high, when we get the serum, it should speed up the recovery process, and in the meantime, it may prevent the virus from spreading.
Oh, my God.<eos> - It's all in here.<eos> - I'll start with the injections.<eos> Okay, treat the sickest first.<eos> Good to see you, Fisher.<eos> Well, I heard there was cake.<eos> Soon, Fisher, soon.<eos> - Lockdown complete.<eos> - Okay, so it looks good.<eos> We've scanned the lab twice and it's clean.
Well, I never stopped tracking him.<eos> - I'm aware of how that sounds.<eos> - I'm glad you're aware.<eos> What is this, Marco?<eos> - Cat and mouse? - Yeah, yeah!<eos> That's exactly what it is.<eos> Only he thinks he's the cat, and I'm the mouse.<eos> When he was in his early twenties, he applied to the police academy in Geneva.<eos> They gave him a psychological evaluation.<eos> You know what it showed?
If I could figure out the profile it was engineered to destroy--<eos> You could run the profile through the DNA database.<eos> If you get a match, that's Karakurt's target.<eos> Except it won't work-- not in time, at least.<eos> I need hours-- days, maybe-- and the memorial will be over long before we can ID the target sequence.<eos> Whatever his plan, we have to assume Karakurt's already infected himself with the contagion and is a live carrier.<eos> Civilian and military security assets have been marshalled for the service.<eos> However, the assassin in this case is not armed with something that we can flag with a metal detector.<eos> The virus is transmitted through touch.<eos> It penetrates the skin.
So...<eos> So whoever he's targeting next will be an enemy of Russia, an outspoken critic.<eos> Someone people will believe the Russians would want to silence.<eos> 67 guests have been cleared to attend.<eos> There's Defense, Homeland, CIA, the Bureau on this list.<eos> It's gonna be hard to narrow it down.<eos> Yeah, so much for the good old days where you could just look for the glint of a sniper-rifle scope in a nearby window.<eos> What does it do, this virus, to the body?<eos> The CDC's still breaking it down.<eos> But they're saying it attacks the central nervous system.
People will go on believing I'm a terrorist.<eos> Check the surveillance feeds from the hotel where Connolly was shot.<eos> We already have.<eos> Check again.<eos> I want to know exactly what role Cooper played.<eos> DCFD is responding to a vehicle fire in Columbia Heights.<eos> It looks like the transport vehicle used by Mr. Reddington's people.<eos> Any signs of Keen or Reddington?<eos> Nope.<eos> We'll try and recover the VIN numbers on the transport and any vehicles it may have been carrying, but right now, the fire's too hot, so it looks like they got away.
And then, four minutes later...<eos> Dasvidaniya, baby.<eos> Some guys stash burn phones,<eos> Arkady stashes burn vehicles.<eos> Insurance on all those extra cars must be a nightmare.<eos> Where is he now?<eos> Uh... headed west on Ventura Boulevard.<eos> All right, get that Intel to Callen and Sam.<eos> Copy that.<eos> And find that tanker before it shows up 50 yards off the Santa Monica pier.
Berkeley said there was a backup GPS system on some ship.<eos> There's a laptop pinging its location.<eos> Where?<eos> His sister's house.<eos> If Arkady has that laptop, he knows where the tanker is.<eos> I'll call Callen and Sam.<eos> Oh, uh... good luck on the inside.<eos> Don't drop that soap!<eos> What if Elia didn't give up the laptop and Arkady couldn't find it before he had to bug off?<eos> It could still be at the house.
Sounds easy enough.<eos> Eh, anything but.<eos> The buyers' terminals aren't networked.<eos> Data's sent via sat phone interface.<eos> And for the virus to work, it's got to be placed at all five buyers' terminals using these...<eos> And each one of those five terminals will be in a separate room of the hotel.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Wow. Cakewalk.<eos> Oh, it gets better.<eos> In order for the virus to give us the physical location of the sellers, it must crash the auction.
Virus downloading.<eos> Good.<eos> Time to go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And thank you.<eos> 50 seconds until the sellers know we're here.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Just amp up the pressure.<eos> Sorry. Just updating the team.<eos> The virus is working, it's narrowing the field.
We shall all be gods again when you open that jar.<eos> Tammy, stop it!<eos> Come on.<eos> Leave it alone.<eos> - This is private property! - Ooh. Ah.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Er, I didn't mean to bother anyone.<eos> Then leave... now.<eos> It's just I was looking for the old Roman temple.<eos> It's on some of the mediaeval maps and I...

Wouldn't want you to come to any harm.<eos> You could stay here, if you must.<eos> Something's killing the animals?<eos> I see your pub's called The Black Dog.<eos> Legend round these parts.<eos> We call it Old Shuck.<eos> Story goes, if you see it, you're not long for this world.<eos> Listen, I want to get to that house.<eos> There's a footpath.<eos> But it might not be safe.
You've won.<eos> Beaten them.<eos> What more do you want?<eos> I'm surrounded by enemies who seem to have read the entry to "Robert Jekyll" in the encyclopaedia.<eos> Yet, what do I know? Nothing.<eos> My father left that file for me.<eos> It will tell me what happened to him.<eos> Why I'm so important to Tenebrae and MIO.<eos> You're asking an awful lot of one little file.<eos> What if it's just a collection of cherished family recipes?
W-Well, well, my-my schedule is too full from writing dope raps to suck your dick!<eos> Yeah!<eos> And Jaclyn and I recently decided to become exclusive, so I don't think she would appreciate me sucking your dick!<eos> Just knock some shit over.<eos> - Rap beef! Rap beef!<eos> - Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.<eos> We out of here... we out of here, 'Stain.<eos> Oh, my God, I was so scared.<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> Gazing into the darkness, seeing if it gazes back.
I stole some checkers from the rec room.<eos> Just making a little chaos.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> - That wasn't your mum, was it?<eos> - No, no.<eos> She's, uh... she's back in Boca.<eos> How long were you talking to that old lady, you weirdo?<eos> I'm going home.<eos> I read your book.<eos> It's amazing.
And then suddenly, our marriage was one long rough patch.<eos> You've got a career, a nice house, got your own Paki.<eos> Don't do what I did and let some black cloud of a bird screw it up.<eos> But I really like Gretchen, so...<eos> No, there's always more girls.<eos> Hey.<eos> This is my son, Jimmy.<eos> He wrote a novel.<eos> Published and all.<eos> It's quite good.
And I was thinking maybe we could do it together.<eos> I would love to!<eos> Can we sit next to each other?<eos> You understand it's online?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> (chuckles softly)<eos> Got you a little present.<eos> What?<eos> Ah!<eos> It made me feel like God.
If I were to give you my word nothing took place of which you disapprove?<eos> If I could just be sure.<eos> So my word is still not good enough, Mr Carson, after so many years?<eos> I only wish it were.<eos> Golly, Moses. You astound me.<eos> And all from the sale of tickets?<eos> - It's a great deal of money.<eos> - I don't suppose we could open - on a regular basis?<eos> - For charity, you mean?<eos> For us. The house costs money to run and it doesn't raise a penny.
Still at least he's got away from you.<eos> Which is something to give thanks for, I suppose!<eos> I beg your pardon, M'Lord but Mrs Patmore has something to say.<eos> - I wonder if now would be convenient.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Bring her in.<eos> - How can we help, Mrs Patmore?<eos> - Well, that's just it, M'Lord.<eos> I know you're planning to help by coming over to the cottage for some tea but should you be mixed up in it?<eos> - It's my mess, why should you pay for it?
She works for Mr Travis at the vicarage.<eos> Dad's a gardener at Skelton Park.<eos> But I never gave up on learning, do you see?<eos> I read as much as I could and I taught myself, and I hope to be able to teach you.<eos> Maybe give you the shortcut that I never had...<eos> Right.<eos> The Civil War.<eos> Let's start with the Divine Right of Kings.<eos> Did King Charles really believe that he had a Divine Right to rule?<eos> Or did he just choose to believe it because it suited him?
Your sister hasn't been helpful.<eos> Mary and I are locked into a kind of lifelong struggle and I don't know, it's hard for an outsider to understand.<eos> It's hard for me. Who invented families?<eos> That's what I'd like to know.<eos> - What time is Miss Jones coming today?<eos> - Five.<eos> For tea.<eos> Do we know her real name yet?<eos> She only writes as Cassandra Jones which is the name on her account.<eos> Perhaps it is her real name, after all.
We're heading, er...<eos> West...<eos> We just passed a windmill...<eos> He's braking, he's turning left, left, left, towards the university.<eos> He's passing...<eos> He's turning into South North Road...<eos> - North South Road.<eos> - North South Road.<eos> The sat nav's not working.<eos> It's not keeping up.
But it seems like everything is moving.<eos> I'm in a truck.<eos> We're in the jungle.<eos> And there's someone chasing us.<eos> They're shooting at us.<eos> There's a blond man in a truck.<eos> He's leading the charge.<eos> Faster! - A military truck?<eos> - No, it's a civilian truck.<eos> But it has a very... strange... license plate.
Maybe those images that you saw in your dream are not really your memories.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> They're memories.<eos> They're memories.<eos> And you said follow them wherever they go, and this is where they go...<eos> Thailand. This is all about Thailand.<eos> Okay, well, why don't we take a step back from Thailand.<eos> Why don't we take a look at some of the other images, like the... the trophy.<eos> Eh, the trophy's irrelevant.<eos> Well, it was in your dream for a reason.
Oh, no.<eos> They're memories.<eos> They're memories.<eos> And you said follow them wherever they go, and this is where they go...<eos> Thailand. This is all about Thailand.<eos> Okay, well, why don't we take a step back from Thailand.<eos> Why don't we take a look at some of the other images, like the... the trophy.<eos> Eh, the trophy's irrelevant.<eos> Well, it was in your dream for a reason.<eos> You said it was familiar.
What were you doing when this buzzing first started?<eos> I was writing.<eos> Or, rather, procrastinating.<eos> I was stuck on a scene, so I was just people-watching.<eos> Anyone you knew?<eos> Or recognized?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> That ringing... it started when I looked up at the TV.
- When did you get back?<eos> - Last night.<eos> It was late.<eos> But you and Munir weren't home when I woke up.<eos> We, uh... we slept outside.<eos> How come?<eos> It was a beautiful night.<eos> I have to get to work, okay?<eos> Kasim?<eos> Your backpack, it's leaking; what's in there?
She knows me.<eos> - Mrs. Al Fayeed.<eos> - It's all right, it's all right, let her through.<eos> Please. Halima.<eos> My little sister.<eos> Her name was Jada.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> How can you be sorry and guilty at the same time?<eos> Tell me, because I'm curious.<eos> Or does repeating a lie often enough make it the truth, even to you?
I'm Dr. Evanston.<eos> - Is that your husband there?<eos> - Ex.<eos> But he would want me in there.<eos> I'm sure he would, but he's got a bullet lodged a quarter inch from his heart.<eos> And since I'm the guy whose gonna get it out, what matters now is what I want.<eos> Which would be what?<eos> Go to the waiting room.<eos> Call whoever who need to call. Let me do my job.<eos> It'll be four, five hours.
I have a desk and everything.<eos> - He does. - One Butch O'Banion, an Angels of Darkness motorcycle gang member, is currently on trial for the murder of a Visigoth deputy.<eos> The Angels of Darkness and the Visigoths are arch rivals.<eos> Maybe this is the Visigoth's attempt to take O'Banion out.<eos> And you know what time most criminal trials start each morning?<eos> - 9:00 a.m. - We better get the hell down there.<eos> Six twenty-five is O'Banion.<eos> It's empty.<eos> Excuse me, they moved the O'Banion trial?<eos> It was on recess this morning.
- Yeah, I know.<eos> Now give me the gun.<eos> Look, man...<eos> I get it.<eos> My dad killed your dad, but you need to know something.<eos> Your dad was an asshole.<eos> (walkers growling)<eos> (objects breaking)<eos> They knocked the sculpture over.<eos> All that noise, it's drawing more.
So the... the open house went well?<eos> Yes.<eos> I think I'm going to get an offer.<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> I was so good. You should have seen me.<eos> Do you want to hear some of my spiel?<eos> - Yeah, go for it. - Okay.<eos> "If you're looking for a great home,<eos> "look no further.<eos> "Now this place may be a bit of a project, but it's got great bones." That means it's well-built, with a solid roof and a good foundation.
Yeah, great idea. Yeah, let's take it black.<eos> Can you have a black lead in a game?<eos> Has anyone done that?<eos> No. We will.<eos> Could we get Samuel L Jackson?<eos> Yeah, I'm sure we could.<eos> You can get anyone.<eos> Film stars don't matter, all right, forget film stars.<eos> This game has got to be something that goes beyond film.<eos> It does something film can't do. How?
People don't know this, Doctor - they should - and you can prove it.<eos> Would you be willing to testify to this in court?<eos> Of course, if necessary.<eos> The neurology is clear.<eos> Has anyone ever asked you to do that?<eos> No...<eos> Not yet.<eos> Your weapons training is absolutely vital, because, as an old gunny sergeant taught me, in combat, you don't rise to the occasion - you sink to the level of your training.<eos> The point is this - what we teach you in training will come out in combat... without thought.<eos> And that is why your training needs to be the most accurate, most authentic it can be. When we use these violent games to train soldiers, we call them combat simulators.
and started running around the house.<eos> To be honest, I didn't think your technique was where it needed to be for the performance track.<eos> But I did hear something in that piece you wrote, something really special.<eos> This is a wonderful program.<eos> I hope you'll give it a chance.<eos> I couldn't help but notice that you didn't mention that the truck had been stolen till the day after the accident.<eos> Why was that exactly?<eos> I already told the cops all this.<eos> Well, you didn't tell these cops.<eos> I used to park it behind the garage 'cause it didn't have the tags
But they like you too much.<eos> How am I supposed to dump you?<eos> I thought I was dumping you.<eos> That's so emasculating.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Just reel it in.<eos> Check out these fashion-themed hors d'oeuvres.<eos> Bowtie pasta.<eos> Gazpacho served in a tiny purse.<eos> Which makes sense since it tastes like lint.
I mean, look at these stupid costumes they make us wear. What?<eos> I thought the monkey thing was bad, but... [Groans]<eos> Wait.<eos> Stop trying to confuse me with your normie logic, okay?<eos> Normie logic?<eos> Monkey? You might want to set some higher goals for yourself.<eos> Look, I will leave your dad's suit in here for you, okay?<eos> Oh.<eos> One word of advice...<eos> If it gets out of hand out there, just start a food fight.
There.<eos> It was only in death that my mother could finally do something good for her daughter.<eos> You're the only family I have left, thanks to Amanda.<eos> I'm here for you.<eos> But she is still a threat.<eos> The only reason for her to confess is that she's up to something.<eos> Well, whatever her next move,<eos> I will go to my grave before I allow her to hurt my children again.<eos> Mascelli, where's the fire?<eos> It could be anywhere!
But I promise, we will be reunited one day.<eos> Until then, I need you to keep up the charade.<eos> For me.<eos> Of course.<eos> Mama.<eos> Now I've been looking into Margaux's finances, and she recently wired a lot of money into someone's encrypted account in the Caymans.<eos> Maybe that's for Victoria.<eos> It could lead us right to her.<eos> I thought the same thing, but the account's been open for years, receiving large sums from all over the globe.<eos> I think I may have figured out who it belongs to.
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Al Fayeed, but I was reviewing your layout for tomorrow's groundbreaking ceremony and was wondering if I could call your attention to a couple of things.<eos> What do you need?<eos> It occurred to us once we arrived - that the event is at 4:00 in the afternoon.<eos> - Mm. At 4:00 in the afternoon, the sun will be there in the sky.<eos> Directly behind the stage.<eos> So?<eos> So I'm worried it will blind the audience. Make it very difficult for them to see your father or my boss, the ambassador.<eos> This is the desert.<eos> The sun is always somewhere.<eos> No matter where you move the audience, it will find them.

Damn, I got to start writing this stuff down.<eos> What the hell?<eos> That's the bobblehead I got for Josh.<eos> That ungrateful son of a...<eos> Hm, good thing I didn't go with the puppy.<eos> Guess what you got?<eos> An app that's going nowhere?<eos> Guess what else?<eos> The gift arrived that no one believed I got you!<eos> It's here!
And, um... and the steering wheel was kind of bent towards me.<eos> Then you hit your head on the passenger window.<eos> That, um... that must have hurt.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And my chest.<eos> Uh, uh, from the seat belt.<eos> It-it hurt to breathe.<eos> What else do you remember?<eos> The-the... side mirror was broken.<eos> It was kind of just hanging.
Cilix may be cunning, but he's also a coward.<eos> You are still their Queen.<eos> The council will hardly doubt your word.<eos> I hope, for all our sakes, you're right.<eos> Before Poseidon, I ask the council to consider a most grave matter.<eos> The blasphemers, Jason and Hercules, have defied the judgment of the gods, absconded from justice and insulted the memory of the holy Oracle.<eos> All is being done to find them.<eos> This very day, the omens have been read, and they are quite clear.<eos> Poseidon is angry, angry with us for allowing the blasphemers to escape.<eos> He will be avenged on the murder of his Oracle, and when his ire strikes, it will destroy us all, guilty and innocent alike.
~ It is.<eos> Every soldier in Atlantis is looking for the prisoners.<eos> They will be found.<eos> But, Your Highness, someone must pay for this crime.<eos> That is our only hope.<eos> The only hope for the city.<eos> There are some, Your Highness, who say that you knew about Jason's escape.<eos> Even abetted it.<eos> ~ Does the council now listen to rumour?<eos> ~ It listens to the people.
I was in shock.<eos> I was scared, that's all.<eos> What were you doing on the cliff the night of the murder?<eos> A witness saw you.<eos> No.<eos> I was in my studio.<eos> I was painting.<eos> You'll have to find a better alibi.<eos> What happened to your GPS?<eos> It's in a rough shape.
We think that might have been more than just a coincidence.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Are you saying that you think Everett did this to him?<eos> Not Mr. Keck, a partner whom we have yet to identify.<eos> Well, that actually makes... sense.<eos> When I found Cal, that's-that's what I thought, too.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, just the-the things that I saw...<eos> This mirror was smashed.<eos> It had to be replaced.
What was that in there? What makes you think that they're already negotiating to get the sheik back?<eos> He didn't bat an eyelid when I told him a member of the royal family had been kidnapped.<eos> I don't believe even the gifted diplomat could maintain that kind of equanimity unless his office had already been contacted with demands.<eos> Makes sense, right?<eos> The kidnapper has already had the sheik for 24 hours.<eos> If the plan was to ransom him, why wait?<eos> What I'd like to know is what the hell any of this has to do with Everett Keck killing a bunch of bees.<eos> So you thought that the sheik was his partner, right?<eos> It's a distinct possibility.<eos> How his abduction relates to the colony collapse hoax-- whether it relates at all-- is, at the moment, a Gordian knot of seemingly unrelated threads.
Every square inch of it.<eos> But I never did.<eos> I went from my father's house, two blocks down to my husband's house.<eos> This house.<eos> Do you regret it, Ma?<eos> For a long time I did.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I realized that no matter how exciting those places would have been, it never would have topped the love I had with your father right here, or the joy that you've given me.<eos> Turns out I had a dream I didn't even know I wanted, and it came true.
Frank!<eos> Even if you broke the chains, how do you think you're going to get out of here?<eos> Fuck!<eos> Was it worth it?<eos> All so you could pass on that stupid film of yours.<eos> That film can change the world.<eos> Yeah, it certainly changed mine.<eos> Why do you think they torture us?<eos> I got a feeling you're going to tell me.<eos> Because they know that that film shows the world not as it is but as it could be.
I'm Supergirl.<eos> And if I'm going to be defined, it's going to be by my victories and my losses.<eos> No one else's.<eos> I guess stubbornness runs in the family.<eos> When I was a kid, I had a train with blue streaks.<eos> Coolest toy I ever had.<eos> (ALL CHUCKLING)<eos> I know a train that magnetically levitates is inherently cool, but still, the color's kinda bumming me out.<eos> Let's paint blue streaks.<eos> And while we're at it, it needs to go 500 kilometers an hour.
That's what you were tied to underwater.<eos> I've never seen one of those before either.<eos> Why do you do that?<eos> I didn't touch anything, look!<eos> I was just... I was looking.<eos> I wanted to see how they felt.<eos> I wasn't going to steal any of them.<eos> No, that, that's not him.<eos> My guy's centipede is huge.<eos> It goes all the way down the back.
What are we gonna do?<eos> She's going to die.<eos> There's nothing we can do to stop that.<eos> But if she could just keep the thinny open long enough for Nathan to come back...<eos> Let me talk to her.<eos> Now, I've hypnotized you before, so this shouldn't take much.<eos> Visualize your mind palace.<eos> A place where you feel powerful and safe.<eos> In your fight with Croatoan, visualize your battlefield.<eos> Where do you want it to be?
Right.<eos> This is the only way.<eos> Go now.<eos> Before I shoot you, too.<eos> Not again.<eos> Was I about to... kill my brother?<eos> How could I have possibly...<eos> What? What is it?<eos> It's me.<eos> I left a message for myself and it just came through.
He really will kill everyone in Haven.<eos> You shouldn't go back.<eos> Nathan!<eos> You came back.<eos> I'm getting pretty good at it.<eos> Took you long enough.<eos> Better late than never.<eos> Where's Hailie?<eos> Croatoan is gonna leave my body any second.<eos> I've got to do this now, while it's still inside.
I'm giving you a second chance with your daughter, Dwight.<eos> I, more than anyone, know how remarkable that can be.<eos> Are you really going to walk away from it?<eos> I'll be back in a few hours.<eos> With the crystal.<eos> You made the right choice, Dwight.<eos> You all have.<eos> Thanks, Laverne.<eos> I needed that.<eos> Laverne, what is it?
Bet the clean-up was a pain in the arse, though.<eos> I want us to be up front with each other.<eos> No bullshit.<eos> I need to speak to Boomer.<eos> What for?<eos> Do you want to take a chair?<eos> Nuh.<eos> Come on.<eos> Where's my cash?<eos> The rest of my money, where is it?
I need to speak to Boomer.<eos> What for?<eos> Do you want to take a chair?<eos> Nuh.<eos> Come on.<eos> Where's my cash?<eos> The rest of my money, where is it?<eos> Oh, I... I spent it.<eos> Don't bullshit me.<eos> I asked you to hide it, so where is it?
I don't imagine you've had much opportunity for socialising.<eos> You don't like me.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> I remember.<eos> We didn't get on.<eos> It's true, we had a mild personality clash.<eos> You had some problems with women in authority.<eos> But I don't hold grudges.<eos> The past is the past.<eos> All I care about now, Mr Fletcher, is for you to drink your coffee before it gets cold.
Hi, Stephanie.<eos> It's nice to meet you.<eos> She's not deaf.<eos> She's got cancer.<eos> The bad kind.<eos> We're talking weeks, not months.<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> I'll put you on my prayer list.<eos> Oh, she likes your necklace.<eos> Yeah, it's very pretty, isn't it?

Oh, Stephanie, it doesn't belong to you, sweetheart.
Actually, I asked Alden if he would teach me archery.<eos> 'Cause, see, my niece is really into Katniss from The Hunger Games, and I'm trying to be the cool aunt.<eos> I regret asking.<eos> And you are amenable to this?<eos> Well, I've always wanted to mentor someone in the fine art of archery.<eos> And as you know, neither of our daughters - was an enthusiastic student.<eos> - Mm. Because you berated them.<eos> Do you need anything before I go?<eos> That coffee smells delicious.<eos> It is.
Alexa... you're gorgeous.<eos> And if I wasn't gay, I would rip that dress off your body and lick every...<eos> But I'm gay... super gay.<eos> And even though you're an amazing woman, I'm... I'm just not attracted to you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll get you that pen.<eos> By the way, I found your passport.<eos> You did?<eos> Yeah, it was in the book jacket.
- There's a hierarchy.<eos> - I know that, Patrick.<eos> Besides, she's been booking solid O.R. days all month.<eos> You're two days back from mat leave.<eos> You ask me...<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - But I'm gonna tell you anyway, Alex.<eos> You should apologize.<eos> The peroneal nerve suffered too much damage.<eos> After six months, we need to accept the fact that it's not going to recover.
- Let's get some high-flow O2 in here!<eos> Okay, protect her airway.<eos> Let's move this bed!<eos> Natalie you had a seizure, okay?<eos> - But we've got you.<eos> - Just hold her down.<eos> - Okay, where's that tox screen?<eos> - I'll get it. - Oh, my god! Oh, my god!<eos> - Oh, my god!<eos> - What is it, Natalie? What is it, Natalie?
It's Bea.<eos> You were just having a bad dream, honey.<eos> You were just having a bad dream.<eos> It's OK.<eos> What's happened to Doreen?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Go to bed.<eos> But I want to come.<eos> I said go to bed, Warner.<eos> The baby's dead... Yeah. ..and then there's a mound of dirt and it's a grave.
No, we're not.<eos> Or about you.<eos> That's right.<eos> Or about why you're wearing that new shade of lipstick today.<eos> It suits you, by the way.<eos> How does it taste?<eos> Or about why you cross your legs when I come closer?<eos> Or about why you smile when I walk in the room.<eos> And I know that smile.<eos> And I know what it means.
Gold star for cowboy guy.<eos> Rahm Tak has done us an enormous favor by setting up his camp next to a gigantic bomb.<eos> If we can contain and focus the force of the explosion... say, using a localized singularity field, then...<eos> We can blow him to hell.<eos> And you get a sticker that says "teacher's pet."<eos> See me after class.<eos> I can throw together a targeting device.<eos> It's small, so I can surgically implant it into the volunteer's forearm.<eos> Into my forearm.<eos> It's nonmetallic, and it will be invisible to the scanners.
I told Bridget something - something bad I'd done, and someone recorded it.<eos> Is this about Meg Jackson?<eos> How do you know about that?<eos> Never mind.<eos> Who's got the recording?<eos> Mr Jackson.<eos> Is he gonna take it to the cops?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It was illegally recorded.<eos> It's inadmissible.
This amount, first day of every month, into this account.<eos> After all, it'd be a terrible shame if the world was to find out you're actually alive.<eos> Now that there is a future, you really wanna spend it behind bars?<eos> You're blackmailing me.<eos> Oh, how adorably old-fashioned!<eos> Take care of him.<eos> You really think I'd come without an insurance policy?<eos> I'm sure you'll be keen to avoid my little website going live.<eos> It's just a bunch of photos, videos, maps, you know, stuff lawyers might call "evidence".<eos> It automatically goes live unless I enter a code every 12 hours so by all means kill me.
- I... can save their lives.<eos> That's really sweet of you.<eos> But you can't save them.<eos> See, there's a big rock coming and there's nothing any of us can do about it.<eos> I know.<eos> Now, be a good boy and stop patronising me.<eos> Here.<eos> You've got a bunker?<eos> Only nutters have bunkers.<eos> And it's in Slough?
- Block that vote.<eos> - I'm blocking it!<eos> - Block it!<eos> Carol, I'm sorry, but I think I'm about to put it to a vote!<eos> Okay, I'm about to put it to a vote, too.<eos> Let's vote on it together, huh?<eos> All in favor, say...<eos> Aye...!<eos> So what do you think of this place?<eos> It's not too shabb-ay, right?
Tonight?<eos> I can make tonight work.<eos> I will do all the shopping and cooking, so you won't even have to lift a finger.<eos> Okay, let me know what she says.<eos> I am so excited.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You are the best friend in the world.<eos> Hey. What's up?<eos> Sorry, mama asked if her phone was in here.<eos> Yeah, yeah, it's over on the bedside table.
Tradicion es para siempre.<eos> But this bakery isn't going to be forever if you don't do something to bring business in.<eos> Mariana, you're new to this family, But you-- You know better, mija.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> This is gonna be awesome.<eos> Okay, did you guys see me practice. The three "Always," Like we talked about?<eos> What are they?<eos> Always point the firearm in a safe direction.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Always assume it's loaded.
Thank you very much.<eos> Floor 25.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Hi, Jean, it's me.<eos> Listen, I'm not gonna come in this morning.<eos> Wait.<eos> What about munrow?<eos> Did he turn up for that scan?<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Well, leave it on my desk if it turns up.
Cross traffic coming up.<eos> It's very close.<eos> It's losing control here.<eos> It's going the wrong side.<eos> Here comes a school bus.<eos> The school bus saw him coming, it stopped.
You said Randall left a voicemail.<eos> Can we hear it?<eos> Well, I played it for the officer last night, but... here.<eos> Hey, sweetie, it's me.<eos> I just wanted to call and say I met with a big-money guy.<eos> It went really well.<eos> Get ready, downtown L.A., 'cause, uh, um...<eos> I got to go, honey.<eos> Love you.<eos> The number was blocked, which was weird, so I didn't answer it, and I couldn't call him back after I got the message, so I tried his cell, and it started ringing here in the house.
Just listen.<eos> I've been tracking an exchange on DarkMarquet.<eos> It's an undisclosed parcel pickup here in Los Angeles between two parties, VinXXX and Huma9.<eos> VinXXX:<eos> V is the shape the clock hands make at 10:10.<eos> X...<eos> Roman numeral for ten.<eos> Right, but Huma9 is the real prize.<eos> The Huma's a mythological creature.<eos> It's the Persian equivalent of the Phoenix, and when this bird rises from its ashes, I'll give you one guess what color it is.
Kirsten, did I notice anything?<eos> I'm gonna do what you asked me to do, tonight, and nothing's gonna happen to the girl.<eos> I didn't save her at the Santa Monica pier to kill her now.<eos> The carousel.<eos> - What?<eos> - The carousel.<eos> Jewels, now!<eos> The carousel at Santa Monica pier.<eos> - What?<eos> - We thought it went off by itself.
I put an offer in on a house.<eos> Yeah, but... offers fall through all the time, and besides,<eos> What do you know about this place, anyway?<eos> How do you know the seller's not some psychopath?<eos> Do you really Want to be living in a kill house?<eos> I think you should really think it through.<eos> Alex, I have.<eos> Did you tell Laura about the dog?<eos> No, I thought we could tell her together.<eos> Okay, but... please don't say it's for her.
It's not nice.<eos> I read your application, saw right away how brilliant you are, what a freethinker, and insisted on meeting you.<eos> I remember.<eos> We sat down at 10:15 on a Wednesday morning.<eos> I offered you the position at 10:30.<eos> I remember.<eos> I was waiting for you, Carrie.<eos> I was waiting for you to walk through the door.<eos> Okay, now I'm a little lost.<eos> I want a partner, someone who knows the world for what it is but also knows it must be made better.
Yes? 'It was all I could get.<eos> 'Sorry.<eos> Looks like you were right.'<eos> You want to know who it is?<eos> What?<eos> I can find out.<eos> You go inside, love. I...<eos> I just need to speak to my friend.<eos> And don't forget the cake.<eos> It's on the table.
It was like a ski mask, but shiny, with a silver zigzag up the middle and... a gold headband.<eos> A gold headband?<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> I'm pretty sure that's what it was.<eos> And, uh, how about his clothes?<eos> Do you remember anything distinctive about them?<eos> But... he wore a ring.<eos> A red and silver signet ring on his right hand.<eos> I remember that.<eos> Evelyn, back to the mask... did it look anything like this?
That there were hundreds of rats on board.<eos> Eventually, the ship ended up adrift, not far from the small resort community of Pender...<eos> Rats.<eos> ...where a fisherman claims to have seen thousands of rats leaving the ship and swimming for shore.<eos> When local authorities boarded the vessel, they found the crew dead, their bodies in a horrible condition, suggesting they had been attacked by the rats.<eos> Among the cargo was grain from a farm that uses Reiden pesticides.<eos> So what do you want us to do?<eos> Go to Pender Island.<eos> Conduct an initial threat assessment to determine if a containment protocol is necessary.<eos> Hopefully, it will not be.
So, no eye contact, no conversations.<eos> Book me, Pablo.<eos> Are you sure that he can read it?<eos> Yeah, he said he could, but you know, that was years ago.<eos> First time I came here, I was looking for an authentic Viking helmet.<eos> I was bangin' this freaky chick who got me way into role-playing.<eos> I don't wanna hear this.<eos> Anyway, I told him about the book, and he freaked out.<eos> He said he can translate it, no problemo.<eos> I'm happy that we're sendin' evil back where it came from, that's for sure, but it makes me a little sad that we're already breaking' up the team.
Look, you heard what the guy said.<eos> The demon stays in the circle, there's no danger.<eos> Okay. Hey, will you tell him that we shouldn't be doing this?<eos> I've been waiting, my entire life to commune with the darkness.<eos> See?<eos> He loves it.<eos> Look Pablo, we're just gonna summon a teeny tiny demon.<eos> Like a mouse demon.<eos> Let's get Kelly in here, so we can take a team vote on it.<eos> Listen to me, every time I've faced evil, it had the jump on me.

We haven't seen you in a couple weeks.<eos> Yeah, been working on the algorithm.<eos> You're always working on the algorithm.<eos> 'Cause it's not right.<eos> 113,000 people disagree.<eos> Paul, our subscribers are lonely and desperate.<eos> They'll believe anything.<eos> Is this what you'd tell the interviewer... that our site doesn't work?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> I just want to make it perfect.
This is huge!<eos> Wow, that's amazing!<eos> If I knew what it was, I'd be more sincere.<eos> Gabi, an Ed talk is when they invite this extremely successful person to give this inspirational speech, and they live-stream it.<eos> If it goes viral, this could be a game changer.<eos> Fun!<eos> Every great Ed Talk has this moment that is so mind-blowing, the entire audience gasps.<eos> I don't only have that, but I have a killer opening joke.<eos> Check it.<eos> Why was the computer stressed out when it got home from work?

See, Steve Jobs had it down.<eos> Dalai Lama had it down.<eos> And Josh Kaminski?<eos> He's gonna have it down.<eos> I want nothing between me and my audience.<eos> You know what, guys?<eos> I got a little treat for ya.<eos> I want you to come close.<eos> I'm going to share my opening joke.<eos> Why was the computer stressed out when it got home?
You know it.<eos> But, you know what else?<eos> I'm noticing you get a better view of the parade from right here.<eos> I wonder if it's even better sitting down?<eos> Let me see.<eos> But just for a brief mo.<eos> So, as our lives become easier, the computers doing our jobs will be the ones who'll need therapy.<eos> And thanks to my algorithm, they'll be able to get it.<eos> Reminds me of a joke.<eos> Why was the computer stressed out when it got home from work?

So... how about that truck?<eos> Isn't she a beauty?<eos> Just like you.<eos> It has my name on it.
5:00.<eos> [knock on door] Hey, bud, you seen Jerry?<eos> Jerry! Kelly, how you been?<eos> - I'm good.<eos> - How's your old man?<eos> He's, uh... eh, you know him.<eos> He's the same. I could tell you some stories.<eos> Yeah, I've heard them all.<eos> Listen, one of my guys brought in a regulator a few shifts ago.<eos> I was just wondering how it looked.
Whoa, whoa, slow down.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Um, I'm at his place.<eos> one of the girls from the club, she's here.<eos> She's been shot.<eos> She's dead, and I don't know where Casey is.<eos> Okay, we got a pinging order on his phone.<eos> Hang tight.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, where is it?
What's the problem here?<eos> It's a drug den.<eos> We want it gone.<eos> The city won't do anything about it,<eos> - so just let it burn.<eos> - All:<eos> Yeah!<eos> Open up this street.<eos> Fire's at an alleged crack den.<eos> Residents want it to burn down.
Play that.<eos> That's a warning shot.<eos> We got him.<eos> They're in a street and sans truck.<eos> - This is--when is this?<eos> - Three minutes ago. - License plate mary-84307.<eos> - Oh, damn.<eos> I can check with oemc, see if there's a gps.<eos> Just find the truck.<eos> [suspenseful music] It was just here!
Meet evan kozelek, 32, from paoli, indiana.<eos> It's a local paper, about a year ago.<eos> (ruzek) that's evan serving as a pallbearer for the funeral Of an eight-year-old girl, his niece.<eos> She died of lymphoma.<eos> Read the next part.<eos> It what this is all about.<eos> (ruzek) yeah. Mouse, patch me in to voight.<eos> You've seen the hostages.<eos> About that bus?<eos> - It's on its way.
- Numbers that don't add up.<eos> - A pattern.<eos> That's your speciality, right?<eos> Recognizing patterns.<eos> Okay, you say once we access their finances.<eos> - How are we gonna do that?<eos> - That's the cool part.<eos> See, as far as we can tell, all top-level Reiden executives have access to their entire computer network.<eos> But the system doesn't use passwords.<eos> It uses facial recognition.
The sun sleeps below the sky, and the world turns upside down.<eos> In the night, we make our feast.<eos> For centuries, I danced for them. The Blood Gatherer. The Bringer of Souls.<eos> I brought them the lost ones. The troubled ones. The desperate ones.<eos> Now I am free, and the world turns upside down again.<eos> They are thirsty for revenge, and nothing will stop them...<eos> No boundaries, no borders.<eos> They will come for me.<eos> But I am coming for them.<eos> Their empire of blood will fall, and I will not rest until it all burns.
jianjun.<eos> Nobody ever called me that here.<eos> I'm the reason everyone called you Scott.<eos> I was a stupid little kid.<eos> And I just... hated you.<eos> And it was a sin for me to feel that.<eos> But God forgives me.<eos> I know that God forgives me because He is love.<eos> That love can change anyone.<eos> It can change you, Scott.
Mother has convinced me that in times like these, even the most personal of matters must be public.<eos> I, Anne Hale, take thee...<eos> Cotton Mather, to be my wedded husband...<eos> Till death us do part.<eos> And I...<eos> Cotton Mather... Take thee...<eos> Anne Hale... To be my wedded wife...<eos> Till death... Do us part.<eos> I have written a last will and testament.<eos> It states the fact that you are my wife and sole heir.
I will certainly try.<eos> Mrs. Mather.<eos> Strange...<eos> You seem different.<eos> I believe much has happened to you since we last met.<eos> I'm married.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Your spell worked.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> But it is not, I think, stronger than death.
They're booting the network back up.<eos> Now, you're downloading the logs, right because...<eos> - Stop.<eos> Tell him to stop.<eos> - What?<eos> Don't start the boot sequence. You guys missed one.<eos> There's an infected server up and running.<eos> What's the ETA before it hits this server?<eos> The backup server up and running?<eos> It's ready, but it's not configured for auto switch.
You're middle-aged, that's what it is.<eos> No offence.<eos> Everybody middle-aged always thinks the world's about to come to an end.<eos> Never does.<eos> It's here.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> 'Hi, this is Clara Oswald.<eos> 'I'm probably on the tube or in outer space.<eos> Leave a message! '<eos> Can you change your voicemail message, please, it's getting very boring.
And while you do that, remember to repeat these words.<eos> We are fsociety.<eos> - We are finally free.<eos> We are finally awake!<eos> Authorities have been trying to locate the whereabouts of the mysterious masked man as well as other members of the fsociety collective.<eos> The investigation is still underway.<eos> The FBI Cybercrime Division is working with...<eos> Where's my bag?<eos> I need my bag.<eos> It... it has all my papers.
I don't understand what you're saying.<eos> - Are you okay? - Yeah.<eos> I think it's just the stress from the past few days getting to me.<eos> Anyway, I shouldn't take up any more of your time.<eos> Thank you...<eos> Ollie.<eos> And, Sarah, we've had meetings all weekend handling the situation.<eos> I'm being told by our network storage team that they are in fact getting to the bottom of this.<eos> Mr. Plouffe, have you seen the latest stock price?<eos> It's hitting an all-time low of $18, and it's still dropping.
With all the fluids coming out of the stomach wound, if our assailant were in contact with any one of them...<eos> Then I'm afraid he was undoubtedly exposed to CLV.<eos> And this is him.<eos> Ivan Amanti.<eos> We catch our assailant,<eos> - we contain the virus.<eos> - You must.<eos> Because this is what CLV does.<eos> It ravages.<eos> Like its older sisters, Ebola and Marburg it has a fatality rate of 88%.
Nothing, nothing.<eos> What happened next?<eos> His mobile rang, it was the man who took him.<eos> I...<eos> I... I... I just don't know how they got our... our number.<eos> Well, portable scanner, they'd probably been following you<eos> - for some time.<eos> - Oh God.<eos> Do you have the phone now?<eos> It's here.
- How's Evelyne?<eos> - Michel's going to speak with her now.<eos> - No Sebastian.<eos> - Any sign of her husband?<eos> Well, probably went into hiding for the night.<eos> He knows we're looking for him.<eos> I think we have to assume that he does.<eos> Well, we could help him if he'd let us.<eos> I don't think he's gonna take that chance.<eos> Not if he thinks it risks the life of his son.
What our heroes found was a live signal from the ARC trooper known as Echo.<eos> A clone on believed to be dead.<eos> So, we have a new mission, Captain?<eos> Yes.<eos> We're going to follow the trail of the algorithm to Skako Minor.<eos> Rex believes we'll find Echo.<eos> An ARC trooper who was missing in action.<eos> Well, that's a pretty covered operation I'd say.<eos> I suggest we use our transport.<eos> Not the most luxurious ride in the galaxy but it doesn't exactly scream "Republic" like the rest of these.
As soon as we rescue him we'll leave his planet for good.<eos> The chief says he'll provide us with scouts and lead us to Tambor City.<eos> From there we're on our own.<eos> Any help is better than no help.<eos> Hope nobody's scared of heights.<eos> I'm not scared of nothing.<eos> I just... When I'm up real high I got a problem with gravity.<eos> Speaking of problems I'm no longer picking up Echo's signal.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You said it was coming from this city.
No!<eos> This is all my fault.<eos> I have to come up with some way to break you out of the hospital.<eos> Uh, whoopsie-doodles! I'm a nutso!<eos> Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl!<eos> Yeah, yeah, we get it.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> If you wanted to come in here, you could've just admitted yourself.<eos> You didn't have to dry-hump our mailbox.<eos> Yeah, you go out and get your mail and tell me if it's dry.
Mmm.<eos> Mmm. You got nachos?<eos> I only have eyes for you.<eos> Anyways, we should get going.<eos> My friend said he'll kill me if we're late.<eos> Well, if he does, we can break in that coffin.<eos> Later, roomie.<eos> See ya.<eos> Who's there?<eos> I know you have no concept of time, but do you have any idea what time it is?
Amelia recorded her voice!<eos> Mm.<eos> Though I have been locked up in this sanitarium for lo, these many years, I have completed an invention that will change the world!<eos> Bart!<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> Good evening.<eos> Because I am not taken seriously due to my gender, a friendly guard has hidden my invention until a future time, when some liberated young woman has the permission of her husband to look for it.<eos> There's a whole closet of these things!<eos> How many magicians do they have in this place?<eos> Find my journal, and it will lead you to my greatest invention!
Ah, yes.<eos> Utopium from the night of the boat massacre.<eos> The tainted stuff.<eos> I remember having a limited supply...<eos> I remember asking you not to use up the last bit...<eos> Whatever happened to that?<eos> Passive aggressive is not a good look on you.<eos> Three months of trying to recreate it has gotten me nowhere.<eos> I mean, the cure wasn't even properly tested.<eos> What if it wears off?
I am placing Twizz into protective custody before transferring him to the Witness Protection Program.<eos> But he hasn't confessed anything.<eos> Doesn't matter what Twizz said...<eos> Only what his gang thinks he said.<eos> Oh, if the Monsters find out we put Twizz in protective custody...<eos> Get a warrant.<eos> I want to do a very public search of his house.<eos> A moving truck might help sell it.<eos> Ooh, that's a good idea.<eos> And before I take that cellphone and figure out who it belongs to, let's find Big Hazard, bring him in here, and see if we can mislead him into telling us the truth.
Now, I've learned it was buried in the Yucatan after being dragged around the earth for a few hundred years.<eos> And originally found with it, were artifacts...<eos> Mostly worthless, except one...<eos> A scroll casing, over 1,000 years old.<eos> The casing holds a parchment which reportedly describes exactly what this monolith is, which is what I want to know.<eos> And I tracked the scroll casing...<eos> not easy...<eos> Through history, to Mosul's Central Museum in Iraq.<eos> But it was taken by your extremist buddies when they ransacked the place this year.<eos> Now, I'm 90% sure it's in this room.
We'll have to hit this thing with everything we've got.<eos> And I need a bigger gun, I guess.<eos> Or my ax.<eos> Or maybe a shotgun-ax combination of some sort.<eos> Oh, we going in here?<eos> Yeah, that makes sense.<eos> 911, what's your emergency?<eos> If we're both getting the call, then I think we know what it's about.<eos> You'll have to excuse me.<eos> If you don't take it out of my pocket, it's just gonna ring like that forever.
So, are we gonna do this or what?<eos> I asked for the ring back because I paid for it, not as a meaningful gesture of any kind.<eos> But thanks, oh, great master of melodrama.<eos> Why? Because it wasn't at all melodramatic when you whispered on your death bed,<eos> "I can't do this anymore."<eos> I meant pretend not to...<eos> You know...<eos> I didn't mean that we should make the tragic mistake of marrying each other... again.<eos> Call it what you will, but you've got the ring you once threw in my face, and we're shagging on the regular, so only thing missing is a piece of paper.<eos> And your ring, not that you know where it is.

My dad had just died.<eos> I'd only known him for a few years, but... We were finally starting to feel like a family.<eos> I always thought he'd be around, but... Then suddenly he was gone.<eos> You were overwhelmed by the loss.<eos> Actually, I wasn't.<eos> Um... My sister was.<eos> My biological mother was, but, uh... I held it together, Because I had to.<eos> You kept a lid on your grief.<eos> But I guess that doesn't make it go away.<eos> Sooner or later, it comes out.
It was horrible.<eos> And yet, somehow he managed not to call 9-1-1.<eos> Can you corroborate this story with any other details?<eos> Christa's computer got hit sideways on the floor.<eos> Uh, and later...<eos> You...<eos> You picked the computer up, and then, uh, you found, uh, when you were at your desk, you found the spyware, you shouted, "can't undo, can't undo!"<eos> I mean, I have it all recorded.<eos> Okay, look, um, I recorded everything she did for the last three months, all right?<eos> It's all on a file, it's password-protected.
Well, we passed Bremen a little while ago, so I'd say three hours or so.<eos> OK.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Are you OK?<eos> I'm fine. Thank you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> The train is in the station.<eos> - Synced and transcribed by chamallow -<eos> Mr. Dorn, it's Freja Jensen.<eos> I'm on the 7-30 train from Copenhagen and... I don't when it's gonna arrive, but I'm gonna go straight to your office, and...
Madam President, joint chiefs of staff, Prime Minister Cho, it's truly an honor to be here in the Oval Office, though I wish it were under better circumstances.<eos> I just came back from a meeting with the world's top scientists.<eos> They're all dead.<eos> The virus, it got them all.<eos> I was able to obtain a sample, but it's not in the vial.<eos> It's in my blood.

Shame on you.<eos> Fool me... can't get fooled again.<eos> Some of them can be a little hard to understand.<eos> Numbnut?<eos> Numnah is a felt or sheepskin pad placed between... oh, numnah.<eos> And some of them are just ridiculous.<eos> And even within that massive sea of words, one word has managed to stick out as the word, and it's a doozy.<eos> I'm talking about the "N" word.<eos> Some people have said it, and it made big news.<eos> Sometimes it comes exactly from the places you'd expect.
I have a pituitary disorder.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> Clearly.<eos> Clearly... it's clear that that's very believable.<eos> You're not stopping my son from saying the "N" word.<eos> Mr. Johnson, what's the meaning of this?<eos> We're in the middle...<eos> The meaning is I know what you're trying to do, and it's not gonna work.<eos> You people are trying to eliminate a word from my son's vocabulary because you think it's ugly.<eos> Is it not?
Weirdness squashed.<eos> Thanks, Justin.<eos> Bring it in.<eos> Sorry, too intimate.<eos> That's too formal.<eos> Fist bump? Here we go.<eos> Aha!<eos> Haha! Your fist is really warm.<eos> It's like a loaf of bread.<eos> I bet it smells good too.
Different culture?<eos> Po-da!<eos> We've been living here for 40 years.<eos> It is like that movie.<eos> What's the one? The Ben Stiller movie where he meets the parents?<eos> It's called Meet the Parents.<eos> Meet the Parents!<eos> Stop it, Ramesh.<eos> I like that movie.<eos> It's funny.
I'm gonna take you home.<eos> The best idea I've heard in a long time.<eos> ♪<eos> Carla:<eos> Look at all this.<eos> As far as the eye can see, it's ours.<eos> Yep.<eos> I guess you can have it all.<eos> [Chuckles]<eos> This place isn't for everybody, but it's definitely for you and me.
Now, personally, I think it's bullshit that he was ever charged in the first place.<eos> I think it's bullshit that you're still actually fucking holding him.<eos> - He got bail.<eos> - Yeah, but you know he can't pay.<eos> Listen, detective, uh...<eos> You have my statement.<eos> Not gonna change it.<eos> There is weights and cardio, grappling mats, bags, and the women's locker room is back there.<eos> Is there a sauna?<eos> Yeah, but it's in the men's room, so you just have to knock.
- Yeah.<eos> Of course he is. Why wouldn't he?<eos> Fuck off, man.<eos> I got...<eos> I got six fights for dog-shit money.<eos> Yeah, am I supposed to be offended right now?<eos> About what?<eos> The fact that you're treating my old man<eos> - like a little fucking bitch. - [Scoffs]<eos> You could kill a little baby while it's sleeping and Alvey would help you dig the grave.
I might want that cloth.<eos> Nah, man. You don't want it cloth.<eos> Ghetto rich don't like cloth.<eos> Ghetto rich...<eos> You're all about the leather, son.<eos> But, you know, you gots to buy the whole set.<eos> - No, I'll only get the couch.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> The whole damn set.<eos> Mmm! See how it feels against your skin?
Andnowbegins the ancient word.<eos> The sun sleeps below the sky, and the world turns upside down.<eos> In the night, we make our feast.<eos> For centuries, I danced for them, the blood-gatherer, the bringer of souls.<eos> I've brougt them lost ones, the troubled ones, the desperate ones..<eos> Now, I am free, and the world turns upside down again.<eos> They are thirsty for revenge, and nothing will stop them.<eos> No boundaries, no borders.<eos> They will come for me, but I am coming for them.<eos> Their empire of blood will fall, and will not rest until it all burns.
The people who think they're going to take down Jacknife Jed's.<eos> Malvado's the collector, and you owe him your tribute.<eos> When you deliver, we come in as your crew, he's not gonna see us coming.<eos> Well, I do have to say you two are easier on the eyes than these two paperback rejects.<eos> - So you know who we are.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> I know this... tall drink of water, too.<eos> Why couldn't you have just stayed where you were, like a good girl?<eos> Oh. You still have his taste in your mouth after all these years, don't you?<eos> I bet it never goes away, even in your dreams.
- You think he's gonna hurt her?<eos> - She's a big girl.<eos> She can take care of herself.<eos> Gonzalez.<eos> You okay?<eos> Easy peasy, right?<eos> Too easy.<eos> - What?<eos> - The money.<eos> It's just sittin' there, like it was left for us to find.
Icarus, tell Jason he's insane and we're all going to be caught and executed.<eos> Look, you can see it in his face.<eos> He thinks it's madness, utter madness.<eos> We should go.<eos> Oh, great(!<eos> ) The sewers.<eos> I can already taste the stench.<eos> Head north.<eos> After about 500 paces, you'll come to another grate.<eos> It will bring you out in the arena, underneath the stands.
Oh, no.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Well, that he is.<eos> Huh, looky here.<eos> All these little bottles of booze.<eos> You're lucky, Buzz.<eos> When you compare notes with the other reserve officers tomorrow, you'll definitely have the best story.<eos> Suicide note?<eos> More like the world's worst greeting card.<eos> "A love like ours must have been fated, even when it's so belated."
Last night, right after her told me that I couldn't run away with Danny, I punched Brad in the face, and he didn't even try to hit me back.<eos> He just stood there, crying like a baby.<eos> I never thought he would take it out on Danny.<eos> Brad's so sensible.<eos> Okay, here's an idea.<eos> Since we still have the groom present, why don't we reunite this happy couple?<eos> Do we still have our privacy sign somewhere?<eos> Oh, the privacy sign.<eos> Just a little bit of advice, Brad.<eos> You can still save this wedding, but it's gonna take complete honesty, because if you begin the marriage any other way, it's not gonna last.
I didn't know you were coming.<eos> I just came for my things.<eos> Come in.<eos> I put them in this box.<eos> - As I was moving in...<eos> - No problem.<eos> Where's my ratings notebook?<eos> - Notebook?<eos> - The blue ring-bound one.<eos> Isn't it there?
According to the police report, the housekeeper.<eos> This is all very intriguing, Krumitz, but you brought us all in here for a case that belongs to ViCAP, not Cyber.<eos> I stumbled upon a little something that makes it Cyber.<eos> The home's security system was hacked.<eos> Check this out.<eos> He always do that?<eos> Bury the lead?<eos> Ah, he loves the attention.<eos> You know, in his mind this is the bridge and he's Captain Kirk, you know?<eos> Anyway... one of the apps I was able to recover from the phone was for P-TECH alarm systems, and the last time the phone's app was accessed it armed the home security system in Scott Barrett's home.
Very odd shape.<eos> Maybe that's what the thief took with him.<eos> You ever see one of these little... automatic vacuums?<eos> No. Oh, they're so amazing.<eos> You can set the timer to vacuum on a schedule.<eos> Is this a subtle hint?<eos> You want me to get you one of these for your birthday?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> No. Actually, my point is this new model, it has memory.<eos> It recalls the layout of the room, the placement of the furniture and... and objects, and it automatically maneuvers around them the next time it starts its cycle. Yeah. Yeah.

Okay, this is how the console communicates with and identifies the user.<eos> Knows when you've stepped in the room to respond to your voice commands.<eos> Right. While playing, the console records and saves the last 20 minutes of gameplay.<eos> I found the console in the "power on" mode.<eos> Are you telling me the Game Vex captured the last 20 minutes of Scott Barrett's life?<eos> We're downloading what the Game Vex captured at Scott Barrett's house.<eos> We know he was playing an instructional golf video game on his Game Vex before he was attacked.<eos> Okay, there's our killer.<eos> The two are struggling over what looks like a golf club.<eos> In the struggle it looks like the golf club struck Scott's phone after it collided with his head.
I know how to prove the burner was our hacker's phone.<eos> There's no identifying info on the burner. No texts, no contacts, no calendars-- all empty.<eos> But there was one database bursting with info.<eos> Motion processor data.<eos> Measures the phone's movement.<eos> Like up and down, left and right.<eos> And better than that, the chip is so sensitive that it records even the tiny vibrations.<eos> So you're gonna tell us how these vibrations connect to these numbers?<eos> Yeah, well, those numbers represent our vibration, and each row of six numbers is a single keystroke.<eos> The tiny movement of our burner, and it has a rhythm.
Now, how does this thing work?<eos> You ever flown one of these before?<eos> No.<eos> Wait.<eos> Uh, just tell me how do I make it stop.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You broke it.<eos> I didn't break it.<eos> Yeah, you did. I...<eos> It's heading towards the Capitol.
What's the worst thing that could happen?<eos> Dr. C met another woman and fell in love with her, and he's with her now.<eos> [sobs] Oh, God! [phone beeps and clatters]<eos> Why would Danny run away?<eos> Just because I wanted to get married?<eos> I mean, I'm pregnant with his child.<eos> And for what?<eos> This stupid apartment that looks like it was decorated by Teddy Roosevelt?<eos> And don't get me started on this ugly piano.<eos> It takes up so much space.
You haven't seen harassment yet.<eos> You see, we have a dead man and need a suspect.<eos> And all the evidence points to you.<eos> Circumstantial at best but enough for us to get an arrest warrant.<eos> And since you seem to hide money for drug lords and dictators,<eos> I can't imagine what they'd do to you if we hauled you in on a murder charge.<eos> It's gone.<eos> Two days ago, when you found the body, the account disappeared.<eos> Every penny.<eos> It just vanished.
I found your money.<eos> I found all of it.<eos> Does anybody know about this yet?<eos> I Th- - I thought you should be the first.<eos> You're brilliant, Angie.<eos> Now get rid of it.<eos> You can do that, right, so that nobody ever finds it?<eos> Uh, yeah, but...<eos> Do it.<eos> It's not my money anymore, Angie, and there's so much blood on it, and as long as it's still out there, every crazy hacker's gonna try...
Yeah, well, it's joe daddy's.<eos> It's, uh, you know, he's letting me borrow it.<eos> Man, that's cool.<eos> You're pretty sweaty.<eos> We should put on new shirts.<eos> Yeah, let's get inside.<eos> Did you walk all the way here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh. Where's the couch?<eos> It's...
It's, uh, you know, he's letting me borrow it.<eos> Man, that's cool.<eos> You're pretty sweaty.<eos> We should put on new shirts.<eos> Yeah, let's get inside.<eos> Did you walk all the way here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh. Where's the couch?<eos> It's...<eos> It's in the garage.
The last deal, the one in Pasadena... I put in 25 grand, right?<eos> In two months, 10 grand profit.<eos> I know.<eos> All my money's tied up in my gym.<eos> Oh, yeah? Brand-new truck.<eos> A bunch of guns.<eos> You can't tell me you don't have any cash laying around.<eos> Put it to work. Here.<eos> Read the prospectus.<eos> It lays everything out.
You are so predictable.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> You two are just adorable.<eos> So?<eos> What do you think, Sherlock?<eos> Well, it's ultimately for the experts to decide, but the original painting was stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.<eos> It's crazy how art has become a favorite currency of drug dealers and terrorists.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No wonder.<eos> If this painting is original, it's worth over $200 million.
Fine. Fine. Fine.<eos> Nice to have met you, Lieutenant.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Just be careful with my stuff.<eos> His body fit in one box, and his personal effects in another.<eos> Couple of nice pens, a high-school graduation ring, child's baseball glove, compass, some books.<eos> That all?<eos> Well, the apartment came furnished, and his landlord sold everything else because Harrison was behind on rent, ma'am.<eos> Yeah, well, it might have looked like the victim left town.<eos> This baseball glove is too small for Harrison, it's too new to be something from his childhood, and the name on it says "Stinger."
Oh, come on, please.<eos> It's really cute, he thinks I don't know.<eos> He's got this whole secret room in the TARDIS<eos> - where he collects mentions of you.<eos> - It's not cute.<eos> It's surveillance.<eos> - It's professional interest.<eos> - Precautionary measure.<eos> Still saving the world from me, then?<eos> It's still here, isn't it?
Well, that was another close one.<eos> Or it will have been, once I've been and gone and got myself out of it.<eos> So, how am I going to do that?<eos> Come on, teacher, ask me questions!<eos> I'm actually scared of dying.<eos> The truth, yes.<eos> But not any old truth, Clara.<eos> This whole place is designed to terrify me.<eos> I'm being interrogated.<eos> It's not just truth it wants.
'It's all the days they stay dead.'<eos> 57 minutes.<eos> This is how my world works, Clara.<eos> I tick off the seconds as they pass.<eos> My life is a countdown.<eos> If I draw the creature to one extreme of the castle, and I run to the other extreme, I can earn myself a maximum of 82 minutes.<eos> 82 minutes to eat, sleep and work.<eos> My work is finding Room 12.<eos> The castle wants me to.<eos> It's luring me.
Pulse?<eos> - Let me do it.<eos> - I am checking it properly!<eos> This should work.<eos> This has got to work.<eos> What if one last heartbeat is all I've got?<eos> What if time isn't healing?<eos> What if the universe needs me to die?<eos> The universe is over!<eos> It doesn't have a say any more!
My entire understanding of physical space has been transformed!<eos> Three-dimensional Euclidean geometry has been torn up, thrown in the air and snogged to death!<eos> My grasp of the universal constants of physical reality has been changed... .. forever.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I've always wanted to see that done properly.<eos> Would you like a drink?<eos> Aldebaran brandy.<eos> Help yourself, but don't tell Dad.<eos> What's that noise?<eos> It seems to have powered down, conserving batteries.
Dr Song, your guest has docked, he should be with you in a very few minutes.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Whenever he's ready.<eos> - Of course.<eos> What's the book?<eos> Oh, it's my diary.<eos> One should always have something sensational to read on a spaceship.<eos> Is it sad?<eos> - I don't know, it's just that... you look sad.<eos> It's nearly full.
- Teensy bit close.<eos> - Yeah, sort of.<eos> - Darling, shall we pop back indoors?<eos> - Yeah, good idea.<eos> '.. four, three, two, one.'<eos> Indestructible as ever.<eos> Married the diamond(! )<eos> Hello?<eos> Sir...<eos> - .. the ship, it came down, did you see it?
Actually, I meant it as a toast, like, "Here's to you, moving in so quickly." What are you, a lesbian?<eos> So you don't think I'm crazy, right?<eos> No.<eos> Why should men be the only ones who get to trade in their ride for a newer model during a mid-life crisis?<eos> Oh, I'm not having a mid-life crisis.<eos> Somebody should tell your shorts that.<eos> I am just experimenting with my style.<eos> I'm trying to figure out this next chapter in my life.<eos> I really love that Jimmy wants to be a part of it, but it also scares the crap out of me.<eos> I mean, what if I make this huge step and it doesn't work out any better than my marriage?

Yeah.<eos> How did you know that?<eos> Because I have seen this word carved into the walls of a castle in Gloucestershire, England, in 1853.<eos> To the plane!<eos> Wh... Am I allowed to say that?<eos> Let's all go to the plane, I guess.<eos> What's the point of a boat if you never take it out of the dock? It's like camping in a living room.<eos> There.<eos> There are easier ways of getting money than kidnapping.<eos> Mr. Braun needs to see the world for what it really is.
Fuck the book.<eos> I wish we could destroy it.<eos> Oh, Ash said we can't.<eos> He tried.<eos> No dice.<eos> Actually, he said that he tried burning it.<eos> But we could... we could electrocute it, we could freeze it, or maybe even a pipe bomb...<eos> No, Ash said we can't.<eos> 'Cause we need The Book to help with the Deadites.<eos> But it doesn't help.
- Shit.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Whoa, watch it.<eos> Hold on, I'm tryin' somethin' here.<eos> It works!<eos> You think there's another exit door?<eos> Ah, no, but I'll say "yes" just to keep hope alive.<eos> Let's check it out.<eos> Oh, a week ago, I was havin' a burger with my partner, and now... everything is upside down.<eos> Ah, took me a long time to get my head around it too, but you're seein' the world as it really is.
It came back, grew another me.<eos> Same shit, different day.<eos> Things were goin' fine with Amanda too, but that went south.<eos> All because of that goddamn book.<eos> No disrespect.<eos> You were the one who read from it.<eos> No disrespect Kelly.<eos> If you live in the past, you hurt the future.<eos> Now this Book has some freaky weird power.<eos> The sooner it's six feet under, the better.
I've consulted with my Indogene brothers, and we're fairly certain that the male is Eksu Tsuroz T'evgin.<eos> He's a prominent figure in Omec culture.<eos> Scientist, inventor, politician, and war hero.<eos> Well, why isn't this glorious renaissance man back home, dead, in space with the rest of the enchanters?<eos> Our long-range scans indicate that he has a ship.<eos> It's in orbit, hovering above Defiance.<eos> A warship?<eos> We're not sure.<eos> Its power signature, however, is very low.<eos> It's in need of repair.
A big fish gun runner.<eos> Germaine was happy to sell his client down the river.<eos> So we made him a deal.<eos> But before we made our bust, our big fish here introduced Germaine to a couple smaller guppies.<eos> Word of mouth spreads, his new clients drew newer clients.<eos> A year later, I'm looking at a network of 41 gun runners in 22 countries and growing.<eos> Like flies to honey.<eos> Like flies to shit.<eos> Either way, their money flows through Germaine.<eos> I see where it comes from, I see where it goes to, I see which Mideast charities these assholes support.
You've got to get everybody back.<eos> You're the one who can.<eos> If I take too long, you just go.<eos> I'm not leaving without you.<eos> - That is not the way this works.<eos> - I will meet you there.<eos> If I get stuck out here, I'll find some way to show you guys I'm okay.<eos> We all have a job to do.<eos> There's a feed store.<eos> It's old.
So instead of a va-cation, you're doing a...<eos> - staycation.<eos> - ...poor person's vacation, right.<eos> Sync corrections by dwigt<eos> Juice it up to 30cc.<eos> Jimmy, give me two fingers on the artery.<eos> Black guy, I need a millimeter on the compressor.<eos> I'd learn your name if it made a difference.<eos> Beth, where's the kidney?<eos> It didn't make it here in time.

You must be Kate.<eos> I'm Layla Gran.<eos> I'm Jeff's girlfriend.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> Whom do I speak to about getting the body back to New York for burial?<eos> That would be the medical examiner's office.<eos> I'll get you a number.<eos> If you need help with funeral arrangements or anything, I...<eos> Look, I don't know who or what you were to Jeff, but my brother never mentioned your name.<eos> As far as the service, it will be for family only.
I...<eos> 'Cause I learned from an early age that things aren't as they seem.<eos> Because I want to make sure that what happened to my mom and dad never happens to anybody else.<eos> Because I can only do so much as a cop.<eos> You guys like cops, right?<eos> 'Cause I'm grateful... for the peace, safety, and stability this country offered to my family.<eos> Because...<eos> That's her.<eos> She's your mark.<eos> Because I believe in this country and what it stands for.
Like you were helping me by sending me to jail, huh?<eos> Look, if you didn't want to go to jail, you should have thought about that before you detonated that bomb.<eos> How could you even think I did that, Liam?<eos> You know me.<eos> You know me better than anyone.<eos> All agents switch channels.<eos> No more walkies.<eos> She burned them.<eos> I thought I knew you until we raided your apartment and found an agent bleeding out on your floor surrounded by plastic explosives.<eos> When I left my apartment at 5:00 this morning, it was empty.

What are you doing here?<eos> Alex retained me as her counsel.<eos> Consider me yours, too.<eos> Anything you say right now falls under attorney/client privilege.<eos> No, he's lying.<eos> He has Caleb with him.<eos> All right, relax, Amanda Knox.<eos> I'm joining team Alex for a bit.<eos> Look, I may have stumbled onto a conspiracy, and I-I just want to see where it leads.<eos> One of your agents reported someone else having Alex's badge the night before the bombing, and it went ignored.

Yes.<eos> And yet you chose two women who couldn't remember to keep their door closed, who jeopardized your career by locking me in this bathroom.<eos> So, no, I don't have questions.<eos> I have plans.<eos> Don't you dare help me.<eos> I know you think you have me in your crosshairs, Mr. Asher.<eos> But let me assure you no one's jeopardizing the twins or their training.<eos> And why the hell not?<eos> Because you're a good agent.<eos> You put your country first and your ego second, and when faced with ruining a good project and all the good it can do or keeping a secret and having your probation struck from your record...
That's both of you.<eos> MIRANDA:<eos> Upon your arrival at Quantico,<eos> I promised myself that I would graduate the best class the Academy has ever seen.<eos> We don't need more agents.<eos> We need better ones.<eos> This test is designed to see not only what you have learned so far, but what you have become.<eos> In front of you is a piece of paper and a pencil.<eos> When I leave this classroom, the exam begins.<eos> When it ends is up to you.

Alex:<eos> It all started six months ago at the FBI Academy.<eos> You were willing to die today for everyone in that room.<eos> You said your son came at you from behind.<eos> How can you be certain it was him?
The site for the donor dinner.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Good news...<eos> I found Brandon's snacks.<eos> Bad news... they were next to the moisturizer.<eos> Nelson has 42 packs of unopened Pokémon cards in his closet.<eos> I don't know what's weirder...<eos> Why he has them or why he hid them.<eos> My sister can't go to sleep without having a stash of amaradine nearby.<eos> If you put it in your cheap wine, it will taste like sangria.
You should be afraid of what people can do to him.<eos> My son has a...<eos> A good heart.<eos> The kind people take advantage of.<eos> I've had to distance myself from some things that he's done, but only because I know they weren't really him.<eos> They were... people using him to get at us.<eos> The cult?<eos> It caused a lot of pain for our family.<eos> Clayton and I disagreed over how to handle it.<eos> He wanted to catch the cult red-handed instead of extracting Caleb before it went that far.
Nimah and Simon, since you found out that the assignments are related, you'll lead the briefing.<eos> The briefing starts at 2:00.<eos> In the meantime, look around at your future in case you make it here.<eos> I can't believe he's lied to my face about knowing my father this whole time.<eos> Oh, I can.<eos> Well, we can't exactly go up to him and ask him, can we?<eos> We don't have to.<eos> If there are real answers to be found, they're right here in this building.<eos> This place?<eos> It's Fort Knox.
Not if you can explain why you've sent thousands of dollars a month to a bank in the Middle East...<eos> - bank with ties to terrorism.<eos> - I, uh...<eos> Until last month, that is, when you sent a million dollars.<eos> Don't say another word, Shelby.<eos> Who gave you permission to interrogate my trainees?<eos> - We're doing our job, Miranda.<eos> - Mnh-mnh.<eos> Doing your job would've been asking me first because, if you had, I would've told you that the name on the account is Samar Hashmi.<eos> It's my half-sister.
She's the one you should be talking to, not me.<eos> She likes you.<eos> But you surprise me.<eos> I'm not interested in surprising you... or doing anything else with you, Simon.<eos> I'm here for myself.<eos> Whatever you may like about me, maybe you can find it in her.<eos> But please leave me alone.<eos> [dramatic music plays]<eos> Where's the file?<eos> Back where it belongs.
But I guess that'd be pretty risky.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> Our Authentications department thought it was legitimate.<eos> Well...<eos> Does your father still know how to get in touch with the guy who did it?<eos> I think so, but...<eos> I have a client in a similar situation.<eos> Doesn't the program say bad choices have lasting effects?<eos> Maybe you should tell your client that.<eos> It also says the wrong choices can lead to the right places.
Wanna go for a swim?<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Yeah! You first.<eos> - Come on, let's go.<eos> - To Reade?<eos> One drink.<eos> You got the balls to come into my home!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Where is the vase?<eos> I went to the auto shop and it wasn't there.

We're both in this together, okay?<eos> Look at him.<eos> He's all that matters.<eos> - I love this guy.<eos> - Hey, did you find my gun?<eos> There's a gun in here?<eos> No. - Love you.<eos> - I love you, too.<eos> [playful music]<eos> Found it. It was in the toilet.
Why are you looking at that?<eos> Trying to understand.<eos> There's nothing to learn from this.<eos> It's possible it's not inert.<eos> Alien metals have different properties.<eos> We don't know for sure.<eos> Yes, we do.<eos> You're safe.<eos> That portal won't open again.<eos> But it has to.

Sorry, Kebo.<eos> That's level seven.<eos> Level seven.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm messing with you.<eos> It was a S.H.I.E.L.D. thing ... one of their ridiculous codes of bureaucracy, though I will say there are a few things that S.H.I.E.L.D. got right ...<eos> And I don't mean money...<eos> or power or resources.<eos> Now, take this job, for instance.<eos> It's all about accountability, patience, an attention to detail that requires a... personal touch.
- I don't know.<eos> Let's start with how many Inhumans they've come across,<eos> - where they take them.<eos> - Daisy has a good point, sir.<eos> We don't know nearly enough about them.<eos> I agree, but if you want answers, then you gotta play ball.<eos> Share the intel, trace the virus to its source.<eos> It was bitter, not sweet at all.<eos> I'd imagined the taste of a fresh strawberry for months, but like most things since being back,<eos> - it just wasn't what I'd remembered.

'Cause I know how to get us home.<eos> This is where you came in.<eos> This is where I came in.<eos> _ All right, professor, I'm listening.<eos> The Monolith creates a wormhole ... a direct line from its location on Earth to a fixed location here.<eos> You said the portal is moving.<eos> It appears to be moving, but it's the planet that's moving,
Nice job, dad.<eos> So, this portal ... how do we know it's not just a door that swings one way?<eos> I think it acts more like a valve.<eos> On Earth, it seemed to open randomly, but it only appeared random from our point of view.<eos> - What opens it?<eos> - The moons.<eos> Their degree of alignment affects the portal the way our moon affects the tides, 'causing it to ebb and flow, pulling things in and out.<eos> So, the portal opens, we just jump right through,<eos> - go with the flow?<eos> - It doesn't stay open very long, so in case there's no time for that... we send a message in a bottle ... everything Fitz needs to know to open it,

What, are you telling me, that leopards are using military strategy?<eos> They're working as a group.<eos> Means they're thinking as a group.<eos> Mitch stuck the cub with the needle.<eos> His pain sent a distress call.<eos> It was just like the lions in L.A., they communicate over long distances.<eos> This little guy saved our lives.<eos> Once we get him back to a lab, he's gonna save a lot more than that.<eos> - The cure...<eos> - It worked.
Yeah, I've only known Dalton, the bartender here, for a few months, but I'm willing to bet that he didn't really appreciate that dog until all hell broke loose.<eos> - How 'bout you just take a step back, pal?<eos> - I think that that's what most of do.<eos> We just kind of take for granted...<eos> Those that we have by our sides.<eos> Until all hell breaks loose and then... they're gone.<eos> You don't get a chance to say what...<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - I'm talking about love.<eos> Just talking about love and how, Sometimes, It only comes around once.

And now begins the ancient word.<eos> The sun sleeps below the sky, and the world turns upside down.<eos> In the night, we make our feast.<eos> For centuries, I danced for them, the blood-gatherer, the bringer of souls.<eos> I've brought them the lost ones, the troubled ones, the desperate ones.<eos> Now, I am free, and the world turns upside down again.<eos> They are thirsty for revenge, and nothing will stop them.<eos> No boundaries, no borders.<eos> They will come for me, but I am coming for them.<eos> Their empire of blood will fall, and I will not rest until it all burns.
- Excited, you know?<eos> I have so much more control now.<eos> Dr. Garner?<eos> Control.<eos> Yes.<eos> That's important.<eos> Daisy thinks I could be a real asset to S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> But she said my fate is in your hands.<eos> Yes, Joey.<eos> It is.
Look, I didn't want to hurt anyone, but I ...<eos> I didn't know what was happening.<eos> You killed all those people.<eos> How?<eos> - When did this ... when did ...<eos> - After Hawaii.<eos> Daisy's mom kept records.<eos> I was going through them for any insight, for research.<eos> And I found a book.<eos> It had all these names of Inhumans.

Why?<eos> I followed the parents to Rio, hoping they'd make contact with their son.<eos> - That's why.<eos> - You didn't tell us that yesterday.<eos> It was another failure undertaken on my dime.<eos> Who needed to know?<eos> On your own dime?<eos> Did you pull that out of that $100,000 that just popped up in your bank account last month?<eos> That money isn't mine.<eos> It belongs to Guy LaFontaine.

A robber broke into my house, once.<eos> A robber? Yes, a few years back, a robber broke inside the house.<eos> But he didn't steal anything, and just left.<eos> Really?<eos> He only left his footprints.<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> That Buddha statue brings good luck.<eos> I used to hate that statue before.<eos> But one day, Strangely enough, that big statue started to make me feel more at peace.<eos> As if it was protecting me.
Hello, I.T. department that calls me only when there's a problem.<eos> - What's the problem?<eos> - There's an FBI task force here.<eos> An energy pulse was detected inside our facility right before, um...<eos> an apparent security leak.<eos> - Have you found the cause?<eos> - Well, ma'am, I think it could be the S.H.I.E.L.D. containment module we brought in.<eos> Dearest, is it possible that your containment module tried to access the ATCU's system?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> It scans any local network it finds.
There's a tactile benefit... the way they feel in your hands, the wear and tear.<eos> - Oh, the smell.<eos> - Ah.<eos> - I love the smell of books.<eos> - Helps me think.<eos> Besides, we both know how vulnerable the digital world is to infiltration.<eos> So sorry, Steve-O.<eos> Nothing worse for an I.T. guy than someone logging into a terminal.<eos> Makes you feel violated, doesn't it?<eos> How do we know he's not just looking for exploits to get into our system when it goes back to being a black hat?
And I can't get the sedative in.<eos> What happened?<eos> He was fine, and then out of nowhere, his head...<eos> He's stable.<eos> I'll take an x-ray in the morning and see where we stand, eh?<eos> He was getting better.<eos> The shrapnel in his brain can move at any time.<eos> It doesn't need a trigger.<eos> I can't have this baby.<eos> Because it's not Rene's?
Gino?<eos> Don't walk away from me!<eos> I'm going into town to pick up parts.<eos> And now you're throwing away good money, instead of swallowing your pride and asking my family for help.<eos> The vines need watering.<eos> I need you to get started on them before it gets too hot.<eos> You said I could work on my novel today!<eos> Is your novel gonna put food on the table?<eos> Keep a roof over our heads?<eos> Well... It could... if I ever had a chance to actually work on it!
For the rest of time.<eos> I'm offering you a chance to change that.<eos> You fall in love... you have a son... and the world will see you differently.<eos> Are you finished?<eos> Good.<eos> Now, it's my turn.<eos> I don't care what the people think of me.<eos> And I don't care if you go to the press.<eos> I have a bit of experience with paternity claims.<eos> So you take that money, because it's all you'll ever get, and waddle your insipid, low-born, barely palatable poon back to the disease-infested shithole you crawled out of.
I can't.<eos> Stay home, Dad.<eos> But you have to understand people will start talking.<eos> Indeed, people will start talking?<eos> Hi.<eos> We should just go.<eos> I'll keep this brief.<eos> It would help the investigation if we could get Elisabeth's computer.<eos> -Then I'll get it.<eos> -No. It's not here.
And you?<eos> Elisabeth and I knew we would always be together.<eos> We've always been together.<eos> The agreement was that I never would tell something to someone.<eos> That was the condition for this.<eos> So you never told about this for someone?<eos> Nobody knows that I mourn.<eos> I don't know if you can imagine how it feels not to bury the one you love.<eos> The cake smells delicious.<eos> Is it ready yet?
The murders are a sign.<eos> You may be the next victim.<eos> The profiler is appoaching.<eos> We need to push the shipowner harder.<eos> They have closed the traffic on Essingeleden.<eos> An accident, I think we should change our route<eos> Where are we going?<eos> We could have taken Liljeholm Bron or GrÃ♪ndalsbron.<eos> I followed the GPS.<eos> I do not understand why it sent us here.
- It's not bad.<eos> That way, you already have one, if you are interested.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Certainly.<eos> Bye.<eos> - See you.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Richard, get away from the tunnel.<eos> It is under surveillance.

Found what?<eos> Your medication.<eos> Sara, what did you find?<eos> 'Last test was eight months ago, since then one sexual partner.'<eos> - You're always safe?<eos> - Always.<eos> - Do you use a condom during oral sex? - No.<eos> Well, it's low-risk but not no-risk.<eos> We're going to do a finger prick test.<eos> It's not a test for the HIV virus but for the antibodies produced in response to the infection.
Danny, why don't you take a seat for me?<eos> Danny... can you give me the needle?<eos> Give me the needle.<eos> Is there someone we can call?<eos> When they took... my blood at the police station, they must have injected me at the same time.<eos> The... The virus can't...<eos> can't survive outside the body.<eos> They must have, um...<eos> They must have kept it heated?<eos> And I, I, I, I know that... .. it takes more than six weeks for it to show up on the test and... it wasn't that long ago but they must have...
I mean, presumably, there are wealthier, more prominent families around.<eos> Can you think of anyone who would want to hurt your family?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Why don't you take something?<eos> We need to gather as much information as quickly as possible, Mr. Davis.<eos> Could we talk downstairs?<eos> Sorry it's so hot in here.<eos> Air conditioner is not working, of course.<eos> I swear, my AC hates me.<eos> It only conks out when I need it.
Why don't we go to an alien world and summon a hell beast?<eos> Yeah, that's a brilliant idea.<eos> What could possibly go wrong with that?<eos> - How are you supposed to find it?<eos> - Not your concern.<eos> You just whisper its name three times into a mirror?<eos> Or do you put a saucer of milk outside the door at night?<eos> - Not milk.<eos> - Ah, yes, you're right.<eos> Simmons said it can smell blood.
- Oh, come on.<eos> What, an ancient alien god?<eos> Are you people hearing the words coming out of your mouths?<eos> - The world's changing.<eos> Deal with it.<eos> - You were there.<eos> - Did you see it?<eos> What's it like?<eos> - I did see it.<eos> But I can't really describe what it looked like.

Mr. Krantz, is it your contention that you were not in receipt of a check for one month's rent from my client?<eos> Aren't I supposed to be sworn in?<eos> And isn't it also true that you have a history of being a monumental douchebag?<eos> - Objection.<eos> - Sustained.<eos> - That's her thing.<eos> - I'll allow it.<eos> Uh... Therefore...<eos> Oh. - May I borrow your glasses? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Therefore, if the defense were able to produce this missing check and prove that it had been in your possession, we could all go home.
Sorry about that.<eos> I don't fully understand what's been going on here.<eos> But, er... This is what happened.<eos> Stop staring!<eos> 'They came from Triton.<eos> 'This is Chopra.<eos> 'Bit of an attitude, in my opinion.'<eos> Calm down, pet!<eos> Well, it's ridiculous!<eos> That thing's meant to be a lethal fighting machine and it just moons around like a love-sick puppy!
Changed how?<eos> Anika, are you in trouble?<eos> - Are you pregnant?<eos> - Pregnant?<eos> No. No, no, God no.<eos> Um, I just, uh... well, I ended up becoming a part of the community.<eos> I slept in his trailer, and then one day I woke up and...<eos> - She's awake.<eos> - Where's my money?<eos> It's not in my backpack.
- She's in her room. - Ah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Are you gonna tell her that's your money?<eos> - Knock knock.<eos> - Hi. I thought you went out of town.<eos> I did for a minute.<eos> I went to see Julian.<eos> - You what?<eos> - I got your money back.<eos> But it comes with conditions.
How serious are we talking, Scotty?<eos> It's a Carbondale.<eos> It's from 1910.<eos> Made from the same steel as the Titanic.<eos> Wow.<eos> Can you crack it?<eos> Well, here's the thing.<eos> it doesn't do so well in the cold.<eos> Remember what that iceberg did?<eos> Yeah, man. It killed DiCaprio.
I'm late to meet Cross.<eos> You don't need to raise your hand, Scott.<eos> Sorry, I just have one question.<eos> Who are you, who is she, what the hell's going on, and can I go back to jail now?<eos> Come with me.<eos> 40 years ago, I created a formula that altered atomic relative distance.<eos> Huh?<eos> I learned how to change the distance between atoms.<eos> That's what powers the suit.<eos> That's why it works.
I'm going to make some tea.<eos> Nailed it!<eos> That's a good boy, Ant-them.<eos> The final phase of your training will be a stealth incursion.<eos> It's freezing!<eos> You couldn't make a suit with a flannel lining?<eos> You must retrieve this prototype of a signal decoy.<eos> It's a device that I invented during my S.H.l.E.L.D. days.<eos> We need it to counteract the transmission blockers that Cross installed in the Futures vault.<eos> It's currently collecting dust in one of Howard Stark's old storage facilities in upstate New York.
So I asked Ignacio,<eos> "Did the badass tell the stupid-fine writer chick<eos> "to tell you to tell me, because I'm tight with Ant-Man,<eos> "that he's looking for him?"<eos> And?<eos> What'd he say?<eos> He said, "Yes."<eos> There's something I want to show you.<eos> I realized you can't destroy power.<eos> All you can do is make sure that it's in the right hands.
I got out of the car, and I walked up to the door.<eos> But I chickened out.<eos> I couldn't tell her what was going on, and I never rang the bell.<eos> Come on, Mary, enough lying.<eos> No, no, I'm telling the truth.<eos> I thought I was ready to get it all out, and then...<eos> I heard the baby crying.<eos> Wailing, really.<eos> If Ken and Mary had a plan,<eos> - it's working.
We also know that after losing that challenge, you started posting threats on the Cochrans' social media page under the handle thextermin8r.<eos> Please.<eos> These are meaningless jests, protected by the constitution, P.S.<eos> He posted these jokes for entertainment purposes.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Would the entertainment purposes include hacking into the Cochrans' car and driving it over a cliff?<eos> Never.<eos> I only use my powers for good.<eos> Dr. Fluke, our I.T. specialists are analyzing the program responsible for the hack right now.<eos> If we can prove it came from your computer, there will be no more dots left to connect.
- Hi, Rusty.<eos> How was your interview with Slider?<eos> Interesting.<eos> Knowing he was being filmed changed his attitude a little.<eos> Oh, Sharon, did you figure out how to explain things to Julio?<eos> Well, not exactly, but I think I've offered him a way to explain things to himself.<eos> And Lieutenant Provenza's gonna check in on him afterwards and see how it went.<eos> As the car began to roll over, the airbags deployed.<eos> While they softened the initial impact, they can't stabilize the neck.<eos> It broke on the first turn of the car.
Victim's name is Thomas Palmer, stock broker.<eos> Neighbor was on her morning walk when she noticed his trunk open, and it looks like blunt-force trauma, sir.
That's wonderful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is that the print report on the victim's car?<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> That was a free-range butcher.<eos> He promised to save a ham for me.<eos> I-I talked him into it.<eos> But I've got to go get it right away.<eos> Uh, but I had S.I.D. send the report to Sykes.<eos> And it says nothing inside or outside the victim's vehicle matches up to anyone in the criminal database.
You have a vehicle like this, sir?<eos> Yeah. I need it for work.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Just wanted to make sure.<eos> Mr. Curtis, do you know a guy named Thomas Palmer?<eos> Have you ever seen this man before?<eos> Maybe he's the strong silent type.<eos> Yeah, but does he speak softly and carry a big tire iron?<eos> If you don't know Tom Palmer, why was your truck in his driveway Monday at 3:00 P.M.?<eos> - It wasn't.

All right, you lost consciousness due to the blood thinners.<eos> I can't believe this is the first time he felt dizzy.<eos> Is that true, Andy?<eos> Are your pills making you dizzy?<eos> No, not really.<eos> I mean, once I started standing up a little more slowly, it didn't bother me at all.<eos> And now you have a concussion.<eos> Yeah, as a result of the fall, Mr. Flynn, the blood clot has moved to a more dangerous position.<eos> - More dangerous?<eos> - Yeah, this is where it was.
She needs an attorney.<eos> I'll figure out her charges tomorrow.<eos> And then we'll see.<eos> Hey, hey, what's taking so long?<eos> He's ready.<eos> Sorry!<eos> Sor... sorry, sorry.<eos> Patrice was trying to get rid of her family in time to be here, but...<eos> How was the ham, Lieutenant?<eos> It tasted organic, and I don't want to think about it.
Mashed potatoes, no gravy, pureed corn, without butter, sir.<eos> A little turkey breast, if you're off the vegetarian thing.<eos> - No dressing, but we do have pie.<eos> - God, it smells delicious.<eos> You know, they wouldn't let me have breakfast for some reason.<eos> Andy, I'll serve.<eos> I'm sure you'd like a bit of everything.<eos> Bring it on.<eos> So, where's this clot?<eos> Oh, uh, well, she said it moved, uh, up... up to here.
Okay.<eos> One hour.<eos> And dominating our program today, as it has dominated headlines across Europe, is news of this shocking document which suggests German intelligence is working with the CIA to bypass Germany's privacy laws.<eos> Our guest is the woman who published the document--<eos> The dissident American journalist Laura Sutton.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Can I correct one thing right away?<eos> The document doesn't suggest a relationship.<eos> It absolutely proves it.

She endangered national security.<eos> We acted within the law.<eos> My client acted as a responsible journalist.<eos> The only criminal act here was the one she exposed, which is why the very first judge I called ordered her release.<eos> You and your bosses will hear about this.<eos> So will your client, if she publishes any more documents.<eos> We'll put her on a plane back to the States, and all the expensive lawyers in the world won't stop us.<eos> Come on, let's get out of this shit hole.<eos> This camp, Alladia, is home to 20,000 refugees.<eos> By the end of next week, it will have 30,000,
Well, now I'm... I'm gonna start looking for the wires.<eos> Oh, no, Uncle Tev.<eos> He was a father to me.<eos> I can't believe now he's gone.<eos> - How did that sound?<eos> - Terrible.<eos> Hey, I can only rub my eyes so much.<eos> I start to look like a marijuana smoker.<eos> Ari, did you ever have a dog when you were a kid?<eos> Think about how you felt when it died.
Always a thrill, Charlie.<eos> Each cash house has 35 workers.<eos> That's 35 mouths to feed and twice as many hands touching your cash, and we're stashing millions in these South Florida homes.<eos> I mean, it's just ill-conceived.<eos> We've had no mishaps in the past.<eos> That's not the point.<eos> The point is you want a numbered account.<eos> The bank cuts out the middleman.<eos> This is 100% legitimate, federally insured.<eos> The money passes through a concentration account, so it never registers as a deposit.
_<eos> You must not think much of me.<eos> And what would I tell Arthur if his queen ran off on my watch?<eos> Tell him I'm going to find the dagger myself.<eos> I broke into Merlin's tower and took this... a magic gauntlet...<eos> And it has shown me the true location of the dagger.<eos> Arthur has it all wrong.<eos> And how did Arthur not find this remarkable magic object in all his years of looking?<eos> He would never think to use it because he believes the dagger will be his strength, and this gauntlet...<eos> It leads you to a person's greatest weakness.
Do it.<eos> Arthur could be here any second.<eos> And now for the final ingredient... the tear.<eos> It should've worked.<eos> It should have worked!<eos> Regina... it's simple.<eos> Your heartbreak wasn't strong enough.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> No, no, I know it was real.
Quiet!<eos> Keep your heads!<eos> Harder than it looks, dear.<eos> If you ever hope to wear that crown, you need to figure out how to do what your father couldn't...<eos> Lead.<eos> Got to be here somewhere.<eos> You won't find the helm here.<eos> I will if you help me look.<eos> Check that sideboard.<eos> No, you won't find it because it's not here.
You mean he was wearing it when...<eos> When he was killed.<eos> What was the witch on about when she said dad didn't know how to lead?<eos> What do you think the helm's magic did?<eos> Whatever it did,<eos> I'm sure Fergus had good reason for needing it.<eos> But right now we have a more pressing question.<eos> If the helm's lost, what are we going to do about the witch?<eos> I didn't say it was lost.<eos> I just said it wasn't here.

No more questions about me.<eos> There it is.<eos> I see you've met me pet.<eos> I'm afraid I won't be as easy to subdue.<eos> We're here for the magic helm,<eos> I need it to save my kingdom.<eos> You're not the only one, dear.<eos> Unfortunately, I don't have what you're looking for.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - If I knew where it was,
I'm not going back to your dungeon if that's what you're thinking.<eos> You really think I'd come all the way to this wretched place just to drag you back to Camelot?<eos> We're here for something else, dear...<eos> Your father's helm.<eos> You, the witch...<eos> Why does everybody want that bloody helmet?<eos> It's the only way I'll ever save my kingdom.<eos> So has the witch threatened to turn your people into bears, too?<eos> You don't even know what the helm does, do you?<eos> It has the power to make other men fight your battles, however dangerous they may be.
So let's show them what happens when you face the combined might of clans DunBroch, Macintosh, Dingwall, and Macguffin!<eos> I am not gonna miss this fight.<eos> Dad!<eos> Fergus!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> - No!<eos> - Stop.<eos> Are you certain the helm's here?<eos> Well, this is where daddy DunBroch's bow says it is.
♪ I'll even eat a bean pie, I don't mind ♪<eos> ♪ Me and Missy is so busy, busy making money ♪<eos> ♪ All right ♪<eos> ♪ All step back, I'm 'bout to dance ♪<eos> ♪ The greenback boogie ♪<eos> Don't tell me he wasn't in here either.<eos> He was in here, all right.<eos> What happened?<eos> Did the settlement fall through?<eos> No, it didn't, but it should've.
Like you said, none of these people are it.<eos> It's late, we're both exhausted, and I've got a test in the morning.<eos> Louis, I'm sorry.<eos> We'll work on it tomorrow morning, I promise.<eos> Gentlemen, I don't like granting TROs without a good reason.<eos> We have a good reason, Your Honor.<eos> It's called a contract.<eos> A contract that explicitly states that any product Alyssa Lang developed during her employment is the property of our client.<eos> Unfortunately that contract is unenforceable.<eos> It is unless I woke up in Russia this morning.

She helped them build their case.<eos> We need to help her do the right thing.<eos> Is it possible this crooked politician conjured the wraith to conceal his scheme?<eos> Right now, who did doesn't matter.<eos> If the wraith is targeting anyone who knows this secret, she is next.<eos> Next but not last.<eos> You cracked the case, Lieutenant.<eos> And in doing so, you let us in on their secret.<eos> The whispering wraith may threaten Susan James, but now we know the secret.<eos> It will most certainly come for us.
After what you showed me today, try and convince me otherwise.<eos> Like you said, solid first few days on the job.<eos> See where it takes us.<eos> You know, I think after being handcuffed to a tree, I, uh, I deserve some kind of an explanation.<eos> Once you open the door, Joe, this whole world that Abbie and I are a part of, you can't close it so easily.<eos> You know, whatever my father was after, he wasn't afraid to find it.<eos> It was his life's work, Jenny, and he never got to finish it.<eos> Never found what he was looking for.<eos> What kind of a son am I if I don't at least try to pick up where he left off?<eos> So, if the shard meant something to him, it should mean something to us.
You can try and take it up with the permit office.<eos> Mr. Crane?<eos> Thank you.<eos> That's very generous of you.<eos> You shall hear from me soon.<eos> The coffee shop.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> It's right there.<eos> No longer.<eos> And it apparently never was.
Where the hell did she get to?<eos> _<eos> I know we had troubles lately, Doku, but I have been thinking.<eos> I don't want to go to Chechnya.<eos> You know this.<eos> But I don't want to lose my daughter, either, so I decided, no more fighting if you promise you will not take Katya away from me.<eos> I will try to be wife you want.<eos> I hope so.<eos> The gun that Dmitry used to kill Jaroscz...<eos> I can tell you where it is.
It's way more peaceful.<eos> Less violent.<eos> Oooh, I'm sorry booboo.<eos> I got carried away.<eos> Don't you worry your pretty little head.<eos> Doc. I don't feel so good.<eos> You got anything?<eos> You're just nervous, papa.<eos> Don't worry. You're gonna love that baby no matter what.<eos> Even if it looks like you.
Grace to you, and peace.<eos> I'd feel a whole lot better if they at least tried to kill us.<eos> Only in a messed up apocalypse was that the right thing to do.<eos> I see something!<eos> That is not a head.<eos> Yeah, but sometimes that happens, right?<eos> Sometimes they get turned around and they come out feet first, right?<eos> Uh yeah, but that's not a foot.<eos> Whoa! That baby's not waiting to get pushed out.<eos> It's pulling itself out.
Road block on the East side keeps things pretty quiet.<eos> After that, where you headed?<eos> East, West?<eos> Shut up.<eos> Sure thing.<eos> Nothing worse than a blabber mouth that won't shut up.<eos> It's kinda like back in the before.<eos> I had this brother in law<eos> Does this thing actually run?<eos> I swear it ran as soon as yesterday.
This life sure as hell isn't easy.<eos> Maybe that's what I like about it.<eos> Tell your employer the Shard is mine.<eos> A man I consider to be a father left it in my protection, and if you come after it again, things will get ugly.<eos> I guess we'll see how that plays out.<eos> I guess we will.<eos> Whilst your Federal Bureau is well-equipped to aid us in tracking Mr. Meyers, once captured, we have no idea how to undo the effects - of that blade. - Yeah.<eos> I had the same thought, so I went back to this.<eos> The timeline for the Ripper killings throughout history.<eos> Pattern is the same: the knife finds its way into the hands of some innocent person, it messes with their mind, turns them into a brutal killer.
You had no idea about the outbreak?<eos> No, none of us did.<eos> The Crown likely hid the truth to avoid panic.<eos> My father must have learned of it by his connections in parliament and sent Stephens to retrieve me.<eos> It all tracks.<eos> The end of every killing spree coincides with an outbreak of disease.<eos> Yellow fever, cholera, malaria, Spanish flu.<eos> Exsanguinated bodies.<eos> The knife gains power by draining the blood of its victims.<eos> And when it drains someone with a disease...
- The Draugur.<eos> And since Howe was their commander, anyone that survived would try to rescue<eos> - their master's body.<eos> - And, in doing so, would be faced with their only weakness, Greek fire.<eos> Yeah, Brennan said it was just some kind of napalm.<eos> We'll get our hands on some.<eos> - Why would that pose a threat to the town?<eos> - Because Greek fire is far more sinister than your napalm.<eos> It cannot be extinguished by water or by sand.<eos> Once unleashed, it burns until nothing remains.
Previously on Sleepy Hollow...<eos> Tell me what you tried to smuggle past customs.<eos> An artifact.<eos> I believe it holds the key to our future as Witnesses.
He's-he's lost his mind.<eos> Isn't that your lawyer, Crane?<eos> When I say "order," I mean order!<eos> This is my courtroom.<eos> No one leaves!<eos> Brenda, next case.<eos> Your Honor, perhaps a short recess before you hear opening arguments?<eos> Don't tell me how to run my courtroom!<eos> Proceed.<eos> There's a criminal element here, and it needs to be torn out by the root.
They never stray far from the hive.<eos> Three victims.<eos> Judge... dedicated to his job... let's say he was stung in his chambers. Here.<eos> PTA woman in her house.<eos> Reynolds in his.<eos> We triangulate.<eos> Ah, hold the phone.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> The symbol on the back of the tablet.<eos> I always thought it was decorative.
Which I backed.<eos> I told you Nevins is the target of an active FBI investigation...<eos> Which is why we got in and got out.<eos> No harm, no foul.<eos> "No harm."<eos> You could've compromised everything that we've...<eos> - If I may. - Mm.<eos> What was inside the case after Nevins opened it?<eos> It was a glowing crystal.<eos> And when I took it from him, it disintegrated.
- Oh, God.<eos> What is it you really want, dragon?<eos> I think this dragon is trying to tell us something.<eos> What is happening, what is happening, what is happening?<eos> I think you're right.<eos> - Dad!<eos> Whoa, big fella! Hold on there!<eos> Go get 'em, bud!<eos> Son, out there!<eos> The sea level... is it rising?
I'm not buying it.<eos> Okay, guys, real quick... - How long does it take to learn to swim?<eos> - No one has to swim. We just need to block the wave from hitting the camp.<eos> Isn't it a little late for that, Hiccup?<eos> No!<eos> Gobber's rock wall... that's big enough to stop the wave.<eos> We just need to reinforce it.<eos> The wave's coming! Hurry!<eos> The wall's not going to be high enough to stop that wave!<eos> And it's cracking!
What are you thinking?<eos> I was thinking how I would like to lie with you... As a woman.<eos> You were?<eos> I cannot.<eos> - Yes, you can.<eos> - I cannot.<eos> You know I cannot.<eos> I will lose my gift.<eos> Who cares?<eos> The future is fate, it won't change.
With Lucien in his ear, how long before the logical thing is to get rid of you?<eos> Well, how very fortunate, indeed, then,<eos> Niklaus is on his way right now to put Lucien out of our collective misery.<eos> You have to stop him.<eos> And why would I do that?<eos> Lucien's seer believes there's an object capable of killing you.<eos> I'm well aware.<eos> Well, I don't have it.<eos> I'm quite certain my sister doesn't have it, either.<eos> Logically, then, one must assume that Lucien has it or he knows where it is.
The shirt, I mean, of course.<eos> But your story was cute, too.<eos> By the way, the first one was fine,<eos> I was just enjoying the show.<eos> Do you need anything before your visit to Parliament today, Your Majesty?<eos> Another pair of knickers.<eos> Simon's monument is nearly finished.<eos> It's very nice.<eos> It represents him well.<eos> And it represents the Queen well.
- No.<eos> Yes, find it!<eos> - (Imitating phone dialing) - No, stop it!<eos> Hello, Mrs. Dobbs.<eos> So Ashley, I was thinking when I finally meet your parents some day, what should I call them?<eos> Stan and Judy would be fine.<eos> But if you really want to impress them, maybe go with Mr. and Mrs. Cooper.<eos> Cooper!<eos> He's actually my step-dad and my mom took his last name.<eos> That's why it's different from mine.
- What's the deal?<eos> You don't have to like me.<eos> I don't like you, but you have to work with me to stop Zoom and Doctor Light.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> I guess we'll see, won't we?<eos> I guess we will.<eos> One more thing... you said you were going to re-task the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite?<eos> To scan for solar emissions, yeah, we're up and running.<eos> I'd like to examine your program.<eos> I want to see if it works.

Andnow begins the ancient word.<eos> The sun sleeps below the sky, and the world turns upside down.<eos> In the night, we make our feast.<eos> For centuries, I danced for them, the blood-gatherer, the bringer of souls.<eos> I've brought them the lost ones, the troubled ones, the desperate ones.<eos> Now, I am free, and the world turns upside down again.<eos> They are thirsty for revenge, and nothing will stop them.<eos> No boundaries, no borders.<eos> They will come for me, but I am coming for them.<eos> Their empire of blood will fall, and I will not rest until it all burns.
Let him take the cash.<eos> He's out of your life, and you're calling the shots.<eos> You win.<eos> I'm just supposed to victory dance my way into an ambush with Carlos?<eos> I had to send him first.<eos> He gave me no choice.<eos> Look, all you have to do is wait until he empties the well, and then take what's yours. Take the tanker.<eos> He gets what he deserves, and you get your heart's desire.<eos> - The keys to the kingdom.<eos> - One problem. You don't even know where it is.
But it won't, because we ain't gonna throw it.<eos> - Then when do we attack?<eos> - When the time is right.<eos> And when will that be?<eos> What was that?<eos> Okay, that's one tall glass with ice, two shots of vodka,<eos> Tabasco sauce, and one celery stalk.<eos> You're an angel.<eos> I think you're missing a key ingredient there, mister.<eos> It'll come soon enough.
And my name is Kisa.<eos> Where's Richard?<eos> He's off to a better life.<eos> I gave him exactly what he wanted.<eos> You manipulated him.<eos> You got in his head.<eos> And you didn't do the same?<eos> Don't fight it.<eos> Let my venom fill your veins.<eos> It will keep you still.
If you stop the pump, we can negotiate like men.<eos> We're not men, Dick.<eos> And if by negotiate, you mean shoot me and take everything I've worked for, I'm okay. Thanks.<eos> What did he offer you?<eos> - Let her go, okay?<eos> - Not now, Scott. He wants the well for himself.<eos> And he betrayed everyone for it.<eos> If this thing finishes pumping, Malvado gets everything he wants.<eos> This blood doesn't belong to you or him or anybody.<eos> - It belongs to culebras like Scott.
One that speaks to me.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What language would it have to speak to you in, Mikey?<eos> Truthfully... [chuckles] I'm not sure.<eos> Does this have something to do with counting chickens and, uh, your dream journal and shit?<eos> Come on, Mike, you know there are no secrets in Graceland.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Doesn't sound like nothing.<eos> It's like a phantom limb, you know.<eos> It's like you can feel it itching, but it's not there.
So I was not really feeling like the number-one dad in the world, which is not what you want when you're about to pitch a bunch of sponsors on the concept of Daddy's Day.<eos> Stevens: Take it away, Dre.<eos> - Dre. - Hmm?<eos> Here we go.<eos> Oh. Oh, my bad.<eos> Uh, so, uh... here we go.<eos> Uh, we've prepared a pitch...<eos> Uh, very big.<eos> Very big.<eos> It appeals to people...
Therapy is not working.<eos> At all.<eos> Okay, guys, listen up.<eos> On Sunday, we are going to church.<eos> - Why? !<eos> - No!<eos> We just went six months ago.<eos> You guys, the Coopers invited us, and you wanted us to say "yes" more.<eos> I could do church.<eos> I'd love to get one more wear out of my easter suit before it gets too small.
What the hell?<eos> Jesus!<eos> There's flies in my ice cream.<eos> Presidential decree--<eos> All ice cream is now for all beings, no matter how many legs.<eos> - What the [bleep] did you do, Summer?<eos> ! - It was your ship!<eos> - Your stupid ship did it!<eos> - Don't blame my ship!<eos> - It melted a child!

Our school is vampire-free!<eos> Man, who would've suspected coach feratu?<eos> You did great, guys.<eos> Couldn't have done it without ya.<eos> You know, we... w-we should be proud of ourselves.<eos> We killed a vampire and a gym teacher.<eos> Ha ha ha. Talk about two-for-one, right?<eos> ! So, how, exactly, is your old body living in there, grandpa Rick?<eos> Oh, you know, hyperbaric quantum fluid, That kind of thing.<eos> It preserves living tissue.
-Are you okay?<eos> -Yes.<eos> I have to find somewhere to hide.<eos> Well, you can hide with us.<eos> Rick?<eos> -Yeah? -Do you think we could take - w-what's your name?<eos> -Arthrisha.<eos> Could we take arthrisha up in the ship and, you know, just wait out the purge?<eos> Oh, Morty, how can I refuse after all you've done to blackmail me?<eos> Your vehicle -- is it from the gods?
We're like the rest of these assholes now.<eos> W-w-we're gonna get purged, Morty.<eos> Help me up.<eos> Oh, geez, geez!<eos> Wait a minute, Rick.<eos> Why don't we just use your portal gun?<eos> It's in the car, dip-ass.<eos> [ Grunts ] Oh, God, it hurts.<eos> She got me right in the goddamn liver, Morty.<eos> It's the hardest-working liver in the galaxy, Morty, and now it has a hole in it.
♪ yeah<eos> ♪ it feels good<eos> ♪ holding' you so<eos> ♪ it feels good geez.<eos> Wow, Morty.<eos> Now you're getting into it.<eos> Never expected that out of you.<eos> All right, uh, let's go find my ship.<eos> Hey, hey, Morty, Morty.<eos> There it is down there -- my ship.
Spring Heeled Jack was my grandfather.<eos> Long dead.<eos> - Your grandfather was a monster?<eos> - No, he...<eos> He was like me. He hunted monsters.<eos> And with all this talk, I thought it was time to revive a family tradition.<eos> Prove that Spring Heeled Jack weren't to blame and catch the real killer.<eos> Don't know if I've got what it takes, though. Especially after seeing him in action.<eos> So, do you know who the real killer is?<eos> Well... between you and me, I'm not sure it's even human.

From Abaddon to zombies, we've slugged it out with the best of them.<eos> We should work together.<eos> We'd make a great team.<eos> Both our families have a history of fighting evil.<eos> Well, I'm not exactly what you'd call a team player.<eos> Now... which one of these beauties would want to steal body parts?<eos> Did you see anything of the killer?<eos> No.<eos> That's what I can't make sense of.<eos> If it looked like one of them, how'd it get about without being noticed?
- What happened?<eos> She was being chased by a man.<eos> There was a copper on their tail.<eos> Then the monster must have attacked, killing the man.<eos> - What happened to the copper?<eos> - Never saw what happened to him.<eos> - He disappeared.<eos> - Why didn't he see the monster?<eos> Why didn't anybody see the monster?<eos> Because it didn't look like one.
Robert!<eos> Yargh!<eos> - I told you we'd make a good team!<eos> - Burton, get out!<eos> It's too strong.<eos> Who's supposed to be saving who?<eos> Maybe we can force the parasite out of her.<eos> Yargh!<eos> Yargh!<eos> I don't know what it is, but it can't take its drink. Bottoms up!
I want my files.<eos> - The ones you stole from Ravi.<eos> - And in return?<eos> - Information.<eos> - What do you know?<eos> Have you killed our monster, as promised?<eos> It's a Kephri.<eos> Erm... a Reaper bug.<eos> Parasitic.<eos> It lives in your body, eating it from the inside.
Have you killed our monster, as promised?<eos> It's a Kephri.<eos> Erm... a Reaper bug.<eos> Parasitic.<eos> It lives in your body, eating it from the inside.<eos> Then moves on to a new host.<eos> Unique ability to take organs from one victim and transplant them.<eos> - It certainly fits with what we've seen.<eos> - And what I've seen.<eos> And you know where it is?
Ah!<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - I'm trying to understand.<eos> There's always one more secret with you, isn't there, Renata?<eos> - We thought you'd run away.<eos> - I don't run.<eos> But you know what this book really is, don't you?<eos> - You always have.<eos> - When did you realise?<eos> I knew it couldn't be all that it seemed.
Olalla, no.<eos> You don't know what you're offering.<eos> What it would mean.<eos> You're dying, Renata, and the seal has been cracked.<eos> Let me be the new Gatekeeper.<eos> Is that why you stayed?<eos> You need to tell me everything, though, before it's too late.<eos> Hidden inside the book is another book, as you've discovered.<eos> When I realised we were under threat<eos> I gave it to your brother to take away, but it made its way back here.
-You're the defendant.<eos> -Aw, sweet!<eos> Your Otter, this is a gross miscarriage of justice.<eos> Hooray!<eos> Gross miscarriage!<eos> And that's how I turned my dream into what I call "The Happiest Place On Urf."<eos> Urf is a made-up magical kingdom I added to the Disney canon.<eos> -Americans, they like this theme park?<eos> -Oh, they love it.<eos> It represents everything America stands for.
Is that a reference from the '90s?<eos> You know that was 20 years ago, right?<eos> Hey, I was just like you when I was a teenager.<eos> I was this badass overachiever that had these big plans to change the world. Yeah?<eos> What happened?<eos> Oh, you didn't hear?<eos> I changed the world.<eos> Did you have a nice shower?<eos> I made you a sandwich.<eos> Oh, but it has turkey in it.
Here you go, ma'am.<eos> Jessica Atkinson, come on down.<eos> Mr. Peanutbutter?<eos> Would you like to see what's in box number one or box number two?<eos> Either way, it's a brand-new pair of shoes!<eos> Hup. Carolyn.<eos> - Rutabaga...<eos> - Coffee?<eos> I was thinking about you last night while Katie and I were locked in a fascinating debate about counter granite.<eos> And what if I told you I used to work Ronnie Bonito's desk, and I happen to know that he had a client so hush-hush, - it wasn't even on the master list.
What about your loud, ugly fight with Andrew a few days ago?<eos> Is that how he described it?<eos> I would have expected something more hyperbolic.<eos> What were you two fighting about?<eos> We weren't. It was a passionate negotiation.<eos> Andrew wouldn't have respected me if I had accepted his first offer.<eos> That's how the game is played.<eos> What game were you playing when you hurt your hand?<eos> I'm not proud of this, but after the news yesterday I went home and I drank a lot of scotch.<eos> At some point, I slammed my glass down it shattered and...
Really?<eos> That's a job?<eos> Yes, it is, Your Honor.<eos> Dr. Caine, did you have an opportunity to examine the notes in Mrs. Smulders' house?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Pressure sensitive adhesives.<eos> Simple and imperfect.<eos> And did you find anything relevant to this case?<eos> Yes.<eos> Every adhesive retains some trace of the surface it comes in contact with.
It just...<eos> You don't think it's because you and I kissed?<eos> Uh, no, I don't think he knows.<eos> I didn't say anything, but I can talk to him if you want.<eos> No, no, no, I'll talk to him.<eos> You know, he's my partner.<eos> We should have trust and communication.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I don't mind talking about that kiss.<eos> It was a good kiss.
How did you get into my apartment?<eos> My father's an old friend of yours.<eos> How does someone like him wind up owing $50 million to an Omar Sandhal?<eos> If he disappears, you inherit his debt.<eos> Arthur and his wife were killed in a car accident two days ago.<eos> Have you ever had a psychedelic experience?<eos> Those who travel are lost.<eos> Those who seek know exactly what they're looking for.<eos> Where's my money?<eos> It's not in my backpack.
Wait.<eos> So you left a job in New York to live near the beach?<eos> We're four hours from the beach.<eos> People say two, but those people are dumb.<eos> Yeah, but, like, you know, it's such a great place.<eos> - I mean, the motto is "Live, Work, Play."<eos> - We have a motto?<eos> - Yes, on the Web site.<eos> - We have a Web site?<eos> It takes a few minutes to load, but it's very informative.
And I will, I will help you.<eos> Let me help you, 'cause we can win this thing!<eos> We can win it.<eos> We can...<eos> We can win the whole thing.<eos> Okay?<eos> It doesn't matter, um... because I just found out that Josh has a girlfriend.<eos> - No, it makes sense, because I texted him 46 hours ago and he hasn't gotten back to me, because he's busy with his girlfriend.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> His Facebook status says he's single, and if he was into her, why would it say that?
Custom and Excise owe you half last year's revenue.<eos> You don't know the meaning of fear, he says.<eos> - Every living creature knows fear, sir.<eos> - Let me tell you mine, then.<eos> Sir William Chester and I are in the process of modernising our antiquated medical profession.<eos> The Anatomy Act will ensure that medicine in this country is practised only by qualified and accredited professionals.<eos> Legislation is going through parliament as we speak.<eos> I think this abomination is the work of someone trying to put a stop to it.<eos> - Who, sir?<eos> - Any one of the numberless charlatans who have profited from the system as it is.
If he'd died from blood loss, there would have been less of it, much less.<eos> I think he was killed another way.<eos> The wrists were cut afterwards to make it look like suicide.<eos> But why?<eos> Garnet murdered, disguised as suicide.<eos> Makes him look like the guilty one.<eos> Just what is it you think they've been up to?<eos> You read that story in the paper, the body stitched together from different corpses.<eos> Galvanism?<eos> Well, it will play into our hands all the same.
In the moments before you asked me to flee with you, I saw your brother.<eos> You must only think of him as the monster that he truly is.<eos> I see him as the monster that he is.<eos> Those remains used to be my mom.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm gonna find out how this happened.<eos> Even if we figure out who killed this guy, it's a vampire.<eos> I think you know exactly where my medallion is.<eos> Take it.<eos> It's in here.
We all face a common threat...<eos> A prophecy warning that my siblings and I would all fall within a year.<eos> I fear my sister already has.<eos> Only as a precautionary measure, I assure you.<eos> Interesting.<eos> You see, I would have called it an entirely unnecessary measure.<eos> We need to unite to prevent the prophecy from coming to pass, and since any alliance is impossible without honesty, let us begin this evening's proceedings by formally acknowledging your clandestine alliance.<eos> Now, gentlemen, before...<eos> Lucien, please.<eos> Let's not ruin the dinner before it begins.
Like you said, none of these people are it.<eos> It's late, we're both exhausted, And I've got a test in the morning.<eos> Louis, I'm sorry.<eos> We'll work on it tomorrow morning, I promise.<eos> Gentlemen, I don't like granting tros without a good reason.<eos> We have a good reason, your honor.<eos> It's called a contract.<eos> A contract that explicitly states that any product Alyssa Lang developed during her employment Is the property of our client.<eos> Unfortunately that contract is unenforceable.<eos> It is unless I woke up in russia this morning.

Certainly.<eos> Please take a seat.<eos> Can we, uh, make this brief, doctor?<eos> I'm late for work as it is.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Um... this, um... this won't be easy for you to hear.<eos> Thomas didn't just pull a muscle wrestling, Obergruppenführer.<eos> He had a tremor.<eos> A tremor?<eos> I wish I could tell you that it was just growing pains, but your son has a serious disease.
You can live in your world, John... if you can stand it.<eos> I can't.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Goodbye, Rudy.<eos> This is indeed a first.<eos> It's unique, singular.<eos> The personal treasure of a true American legend.<eos> Now, as you hold this, think that anything that once graced the neck of this mighty chief... every amulet, every beaded wrist band, even the clothing worn by an Indian warrior such as he... is endowed with spiritual power.<eos> Here it is in the photograph, absolving any question of authenticity.<eos> It's very small in photo.

It would be asking a lot of you.<eos> Tell me.<eos> Listen, I'm starving.<eos> Can we find a place to eat and talk about it there?<eos> So...<eos> So...<eos> Um...<eos> You know I'm bipolar.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And that I take lithium. Which is good for me. It keeps me...
That's when you give me the pills.<eos> I'm not a doctor or a psychiatrist.<eos> You'll know when it's time, believe me.<eos> You should have told me before you went off the drugs.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What if there is an emergency?<eos> We are out here in the middle of nowhere.<eos> There won't be.<eos> The sedative is fast-acting; it'll bring me back down to earth.
So, you have something for me.<eos> You don't know what you are doing.<eos> One of my ambitions in life is to be a trusting person.<eos> I want to trust you.<eos> Unfortunately, I am cynical.<eos> - Take me to your drop.<eos> You are telling me that someone I trust more than I've ever trusted anyone is trying to kill me.<eos> CARRIE:<eos> (gunshots)<eos> If you had a plan to replace Assad, we understand that it would be with General Youssef.
I'm bringing in a polygrapher.<eos> (chuckling):<eos> Oh, Christ.<eos> What you've been up to, he can figure out.<eos> - All he'll do is get me shipped back to Langley.<eos> - Good.<eos> I'll be cross-examined for six months when I'm needed here.<eos> We'll get by without you.<eos> So, unless you want to come clean right now...<eos> I told you who it is.
I am.<eos> I mean, for the time being, at least.<eos> Did you find the man you were looking for?<eos> Yeah, I did, but...<eos> What?<eos> Did he help you?<eos> Not exactly, but I have his laptop.<eos> His laptop?<eos> The problem is, I can't access the hard drive.<eos> It's password protected.
I can't, but the fact is Ivan Krupin's in the next room, and he's singing like a songbird.<eos> He's not a defector!<eos> We fabricated that story to flush Allison out!<eos> I get that.<eos> But she's telling a different story.<eos> One I can't just dismiss out of hand.<eos> It's a Hail Mary.<eos> She's been a highly effective officer for over 20 years, Carrie.<eos> Her intelligence product's been nothing short of spectacular.<eos> Yeah, of course it has.
Dr. Aziz is in faculty housing on campus.<eos> Block A, room 15.<eos> WOMAN (over PA): Respiratory tech to Treatment Room 7.<eos> Respiratory tech to Treatment Room 7.<eos> Well, he's stable.<eos> Thank God.<eos> We got lucky.<eos> Based on what happened in there, has his prognosis changed at all?<eos> Well, it's hard to say.<eos> It hasn't gotten any better, I can tell you that.
Good idea.<eos> Not!<eos> Anything but that!<eos> So you'll remember his name, right?<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> The name is...<eos> Super Sayain God!<eos> As I imagined!<eos> Super Sayain God...<eos> If he has "God" in the name, then it should be a deity.
Has there ever been a zombie movie that captures how exhausting and dirty the apocalypse is?<eos> I'm filthy all the time.<eos> I blow my nose, and mud comes out.<eos> You want a shower?<eos> You have running water here?<eos> Hot water?<eos> I hate to ask, but what happens when this thing hits the water?<eos> Like a toaster in the tub.<eos> Kidding.<eos> It's waterproof.
Watch this.<eos> He has amazing muscle memory from all those years of signing books.<eos> It's a reflex.<eos> I have hundreds of these.<eos> I'm gonna make tons of money when eBay comes back.<eos> I'm gonna be damn rich!<eos> Nice.<eos> Maybe you could do your mind thing and help him finish his next manuscript.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Is it any good?
He said he had some big announcement to make.<eos> Oh, my God, wait, where is it?<eos> Why aren't you wearing it?<eos> Wearing what?<eos> What is that you wanted to tell us?<eos> And why are you telling us here?<eos> Remember this office?<eos> Yes.<eos> This was Sebastian blood's campaign office.<eos> And now it's mine.
And you lost me.<eos> I've been receiving these all week.<eos> Ok, well, I didn't send this, and trust me, if I were going to prank you, it would be a lot more creative.<eos> This code is from 2013.<eos> But the IP address is coming from Palmer Tech, from a terminal here in your work space.<eos> I believe the term is, you are so busted.<eos> I'm not busted.<eos> I can't be busted.<eos> I didn't send you two-year-old code.<eos> Though it is elegant.
Proximity detonator at 100 meters.<eos> Fire.<eos> Three, two...<eos> Power us back up.<eos> Slowly.<eos> Sensors coming back on.<eos> All Longsword interceptors vaporized.<eos> Covenant ship intact, sir.<eos> No.<eos> It is moving off, though, sir.
Yeah, well, one medical emergency at a time.<eos> Is it bad?<eos> It could be worse.<eos> I'm gonna start sewing, and you're gonna tell me what the hell's going on here.<eos> Yesterday morning, I got an alert...<eos> That a pending interagency database search generated a result.<eos> Right away, I knew it was weird because the search was two years old, and it was instigated by a former agent named Kate Beckett.<eos> What was the search for?<eos> The document it uncovered was a just-declassified electronic memo, heavily redacted.<eos> From what I could tell, it detailed a meeting between a federal official of some kind and senator William Bracken.
I just had a really bad night.<eos> I guess I'm just asking if maybe you could be a little patient... with me.<eos> Thank you all for coming.<eos> My, uh, my campaign advisor doesn't think that saving the Bay is the right fight given the state the city is in.<eos> But I'd like everyone to know that I'm not blind to Star City's problems.<eos> And I wouldn't be here today if I wasn't confident that this program could help solve them.<eos> And the reason I chose the Bay is because it's in the center of the city.<eos> It's out in the open. For everyone to see.<eos> The fight to save Star City isn't going to be fought in the shadows.<eos> It's going to be fought in the light of day.
What?<eos> That's impossible.<eos> Ray was--<eos> Killed. In an explosion that blew up the top of this building six months ago.<eos> But that's obviously not what happened, because he sent this message six days ago, and dead people don't generally do that.<eos> Ray's alive.<eos> He's out there somewhere.<eos> I have to help him,<eos> Why didn't you ever tell us about this place before?<eos> I didn't know it was here.
You guys think we can find a better time to fight about this?<eos> John? I thought only Oliver's line was open.<eos> Nope. Mine is open.<eos> Both:<eos> And mine. I don't remember there being so much chatter on these missions.<eos> Are you ok?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I need a little normal.<eos> And for me, this is the kind of thing that passes.<eos> I hacked the security panel, but it needs to be accessed from the inside.
Every access point is protected by a retinal scanner, and a voice print.<eos> There is no way we're getting in there.<eos> Well, not from the outside, at least.<eos> How's Curtis doing on the resizing device?<eos> He said he could have something functional in an hour.<eos> I don't think we have that kind of time.<eos> He's going to have to assemble it in the field.<eos> Wait, with us?<eos> Are we sure we want to have your assistant in on this?<eos> It's my employee, actually.
Yeah, for your campaign holiday party.<eos> You better believe that my faith is going to be well represented.<eos> Felicity, ahem, we just waved a red flag in front a bull.<eos> That doesn't mean the bull is gonna charge right away.<eos> And it doesn't mean we can put our entire lives on hold in the meantime.<eos> But--help me out here, man.<eos> Can't do.<eos> Can't throw a grenade and then go to ground.<eos> John is right.<eos> As much as your speech was about outing Darhk, it was also about sending the message that you're not afraid anymore.
In another galaxy.<eos> Excuse me, can I steal you for a second?<eos> The fire department chief's here.<eos> Very nice to meet you.<eos> Curtis.<eos> Oliver.<eos> How long have you two been married?<eos> 5 years right about now.<eos> Oh, a winter wedding.<eos> It must have been beautiful.
HIVE used polyphasic-encrypted satellite phones to communicate.<eos> That is one of them.<eos> And where did you get it?<eos> I'm Ra's al Ghul.<eos> Maybe we can use the phone to track Darhk.<eos> If Felicity were here, maybe.<eos> But as it is, our only play is trading me for them.<eos> Ok, listen, I'm not gonna pretend to understand what is going on here.<eos> But the idea of you turning yourself over to Darhk, that's the worst idea I've heard in a while.<eos> Maybe, but it's our only play.
I'm gonna enjoy taking pieces out of you.<eos> What do you want?<eos> To talk.<eos> Thought you gave up on that.<eos> I did, until I met your cult leader, Damien Darhk.<eos> [Scoffs] It's not a cult.<eos> The man has people, regular people, honest people, I'm thinking, so brainwashed they're willing to die for him.<eos> Cult.<eos> You know what, think what you want to think.<eos> It's a free country.
Your vigilante problem's getting worse.<eos> Oh, relax, Ms. Nixon.<eos> Focus on the here and now.<eos> There's concerns that you're leading us off the rails.<eos> No, I'm leading us exactly where we need to be.<eos> Beautiful, isn't it?<eos> And I don't even like corn.<eos> Go ahead, breathe.<eos> Drink it in.<eos> Tell me what it reminds you of.
- Strong enough?<eos> - We'll see.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Oh!<eos> What do you have there?<eos> - Mistletoe.<eos> - What's mistletoe?<eos> Oh, um, it's a hemiparasitic plant from the genus Santalaceae family in North America, I think.
"Lily Salvatore requests your presence "to celebrate our town's peaceful spirit "and introduce a new friend-- this evening, 5:00."<eos> Hmm, looks like mom raised her man crush from the dead.<eos> [Tape rewinding] Alaric, on tape:<eos> I promise to be with you and love you.<eos> [Cell phone rings] Hey.<eos> Bonnie:<eos> Hey.<eos> Remember when we used an ancient relic to raise your wife from the dead and ended up imbuing her with someone else's soul?<eos> Why are you calling me?<eos> Because I'm at scull bar, where faux Jo is currently holding her laptop like it's a book.
Maybe a little.<eos> [Inhales]<eos> Anyway, I got what I came for.<eos> Have a nice night.<eos> [Coughing]<eos> Her nose just started to bleed, and-- and then that started.<eos> Oh, here. Uh!<eos> Take my blood.<eos> Drink.<eos> It'll heal you.
It's rarely used but used nonetheless.<eos> Ric, tell me that this isn't crazy.<eos> My wife, who died months ago, just looked me in the eyes and said good-bye to me.<eos> Why the hell not?<eos> Because I don't want you to get your hopes up for something that's insane.<eos> I need your blood.<eos> Now put it here-- Indonesia, farthest geographical point from Mystic Falls.<eos> Your progeny are, obviously, made up of your DNA.<eos> If they're alive, the blood will travel along the map.<eos> Once it's in the proximity of the babies, the map should ignite.
I have to go.<eos> Taking over my bar.<eos> You don't really strike me as a jazz fan.<eos> You're a Strix now, Marcel.<eos> What's yours is our and vice versa.<eos> You should be grateful.<eos> You need my help, as I imagine the Mikaelsons still want your head.<eos> This venue is brilliant.<eos> A neutral space where magic is useless.<eos> It should do nicely, at least until I install a suitable regent to Shepherd the local witches.
He doesn't care about you, darling.<eos> You're just a thing that he uses from time to time.<eos> That's all.<eos> You can say whatever you want...<eos> I can't stop you...<eos> But I do find it interesting how angry you are.<eos> I think you're worried.<eos> If there's anything that Klaus likes about me, it's my mind, that I can understand him, and you, you are beautiful, and you are powerful, and you do have a long history together,<eos> but you're worried he doesn't love you, that maybe he does see the truth...<eos> That your mind, it's a bit damaged, isn't it?
Look.<eos> He's too weak to fight, and Elijah's cavalry just got here. Go now.<eos> Your brother's gonna wake up mad at me.<eos> When he does, be sure to remind him who his friends are.<eos> [Freya whimpers]<eos> Oh, you're quite cross, aren't you?<eos> I haven't seen you this mad in a thousand years.<eos> If you don't behave yourself, you'll see a lot worse.<eos> I don't much like that tone, although, given what I did to Rebekah,<eos> I suppose it's to be expected unless the source of your ire is the threat I made against your little pet.
I mean, I can get another one.<eos> Sure.<eos> Hey, what's up?<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Um... what is wrong with this picture?<eos> - (laughter) - (girl) Whoo! (Max) Looks like a underage porn set? Aside from that.<eos> - No, no, no, no. In addition to that.<eos> (chanting) Gabe! Gabe! Gabe!<eos> Gabe's not doing too well, huh?<eos> Oh, how he's been drinking himself into oblivion for weeks, and he's spending his dad's insurance money like it's not gonna run out.
If he's that bad at blending in, he'll leave a trail a mile wide.<eos> Well... we don't need a trail.<eos> We just need a ping.<eos> Not a blip, not a bleep.<eos> The stolen computers have got to be at least a mile away.<eos> So that would tell us if they were closer?<eos> It's a cell phone tower simulator.<eos> It sucks up every signal in a ten-block radius.<eos> When DARPA funds classified research, the grant recipients have to use DARPA computers.<eos> So the laptops that were stolen, they all have a small, battery-powered 4G router, and it would ping if this unit was close enough.
- You did earn it.<eos> You'd have earned it every day.<eos> It was just like Monaco.<eos> Something that was real and truthful, something that mattered, was twisted into something ugly because of your world.<eos> I told you, Liam, I wanted you, not your world.<eos> But they're both the same thing.<eos> - They don't have to be.<eos> - Yes, they do.<eos> Your world is their world, no matter what.<eos> I wish it wasn't, but it is.
- Yes.<eos> I killed a Gelumcaedus right where you're standing.<eos> And Chavez died right here.<eos> Ground is still wet.<eos> Wait a minute<eos> Are you saying somebody came back here, took all the bodies and cleaned up all the blood?<eos> Somebody went to a lot of trouble to cover this up.<eos> Just like they did with Juliette.<eos> This is Chavez' phone.<eos> It rang right after she died.
Then we honor the things that we have hunted, the things that we have killed but have given us life.<eos> That is so violent, but it's ours.<eos> Force and power for each of us.<eos> Mm.<eos> Safe trip.<eos> You smell so good.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> It's shampoo.<eos> Now you have good luck with that new little one.<eos> It's going to be so much light into your life.
My guess is he was working for the FBI the entire time, even as far back as 2001.<eos> Wouldn't the FBI have told you if they had someone undercover?<eos> No one at the Bureau will answer my questions about Odum.<eos> You're not here in an official capacity, are you, Curtis?<eos> You-You know what he did to me.<eos> If Dmitry was working for the FBI back then, then someone in Czech intelligence must have known about it.<eos> Now you're a big shot now.<eos> I'll make a few inquiries.<eos> But do me a favor, Curtis.<eos> Don't stick your nose where it doesn't belong.
Put your weight behind it.<eos> Nice!<eos> Listen to that snap.<eos> There you go.<eos> Megan... when I was here yesterday,<eos> I wasn't 100% honest with you.<eos> There was something I wanted to say, but... I was scared.<eos> This is the mating song of the Coolangatta egret.<eos> This bird practices lifelong fidelity.<eos> And when it knows it's found its one true mate, it does this.
"Sanctuary," a proposal by Kelly Hadler.<eos> "'Sanctuary', cries the hunchback "in Victor Hugo's 'Hunchback of Notre Dame, '<eos> "as he searches for the safety of the church, the gypsy girl Esmerelda in his arms..."<eos> Thank you.<eos> "Sanctuary,<eos> "this ancient practice of compassion "is grounded upon two principles.<eos> "The first, that human life is sacred "and worthy of protection.<eos> "The second principle is, "that there are places and spaces in this world that lie beyond the reach of the state."<eos> Yes?<eos> What is it?
I'm not getting old.<eos> Ubba.<eos> I have seen the land outside the city.<eos> I have a plan in mind.<eos> A good plan.<eos> And my son would like to whet his sword with you.<eos> So do we fight?<eos> Storri?<eos> The signs are good.<eos> Only this morning, I saw a raven fly towards the Saxon camp, and it was asking me to follow.
- We built a hall in the gorge.<eos> I am the mistress and Uhtred is a warrior.<eos> - Not a servant?<eos> - It is a game.<eos> - A wolf!<eos> - Uhtred.<eos> That's it, a wolf.<eos> Boar!<eos> Watch out!<eos> I saw it... it had sharp teeth and yellow eyes.
I'm removing the last of his curse with a kiss.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> If you want to go to the Danes, then go, find a new Lord.<eos> It's me they wish to kill.<eos> You sound like a child.<eos> I'm offering you a choice.<eos> You're talking through your ass.<eos> I'm sitting on my ass.<eos> So your ass is cleverer than you.<eos> It can do two things at once.
I should really take your balls for this desecration.<eos> - Yes, lor... no, Lord, please.<eos> - I don't care for you, your wife, your children, nor your whore.<eos> Lord, he made me do it with the promise of a coin.<eos> It was false promise, Lord.<eos> I have no coin.<eos> I'll need a fresh horse, food, and drink.<eos> Yes, Lord.<eos> Your horse was returned.<eos> It's in the stable.
He wants your assurance you will keep the peace.<eos> - What peace?<eos> - His peace, you fool.<eos> It does not matter a gnat's dick that you killed Ubba.<eos> What matters is that Odda the younger has claimed the credit.<eos> Should his father die from his wounds,<eos> Odda becomes one of the richest men in Wessex, and men will want to praise his bravery.<eos> My bravery.<eos> Not a gnat's dick.<eos> The sun now shines from Odda the younger's arsehole, and it is blinding.
I have known women, Lord,<eos> - lots and lots of women!<eos> - Man: Lucky bugger.<eos> [Laughter]<eos> Women of all sizes.<eos> The big tits, small tits.<eos> I have squeezed and kissed them all.<eos> I have rested my head on the bosoms of beautiful, but bad, bad women, Lord.<eos> Forgive me!<eos> I have lost count of the number of women I have had, but I know it is exactly half the number of tits I have caressed.
- He takes his payments in split wood.<eos> - We need timber,<eos> - why not split it ourselves?<eos> - Wigulf's always done it, Lord.<eos> So if I go to Wigulf, he'll tell me how many such trees he has split, and you'll show me the timber?<eos> How much is a tree like this worth?<eos> - 8, 9 shillings?<eos> - I'm not certain, Lord.<eos> - How much does he pay you for my timber?<eos> - Lord, it is one tree.
You must come to Cynuit and inspect the building work.<eos> Oh, I will, I will.<eos> I would like that.<eos> It's impressive enough, even now.<eos> Yes.<eos> We have the nave here.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> The transept's thus, and then into the chancel.<eos> With its already famous altar of solid gold.<eos> It will be gilding, no more, Lord, but you know how tongues wag.
Mm-hmm.<eos> The transept's thus, and then into the chancel.<eos> With its already famous altar of solid gold.<eos> It will be gilding, no more, Lord, but you know how tongues wag.<eos> [Chuckles]<eos> Mm.<eos> With your permission,<eos> I would like to place the altar just here.<eos> - Why would you need my permission?<eos> - It's on the exact spot where Ubba Lothbrokson is now buried.
Who the hell are you?<eos> The guy who's saving your ass.<eos> Can we go now?<eos> Go.<eos> Now wait a second.<eos> What about the film?<eos> You have lost it.<eos> No.<eos> I paid good money for that thing.<eos> It no longer belongs to you.
- Let's get ready to roll him.<eos> - Brisk facial bleeding.<eos> - And on my count.<eos> - One, two, three, roll.<eos> - Glass embedded pretty much everywhere.<eos> Okay.<eos> We're gonna need to roll her off the board.<eos> Carefully, she might have a C-spine injury.<eos> Dr. Lorenson, I need you to hold that neck like it's disconnected.<eos> It might be.
No cardiac activity.<eos> Dr. Leighton, can you inject with intracardiac epinephrine, please?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Dr. Pineda, get your hands in here.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah, get your hands in.<eos> Put them around the heart really gently, and you're gonna massage it.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> I feel it.<eos> It's beating now.

Savetti, step out, please.<eos> - Come on, me?<eos> - Now, son.<eos> Are you the attending?<eos> I'm Dr. Edward Darius.<eos> I'm...<eos> Whoever you think you are, you have zero authority in here.<eos> I play racquetball with Ed Harbert, C.E.O. of this hospital.<eos> Did you know only 1% of all males can perform auto-fellatio?<eos> You, sir, have a serious medical issue, and it does need to be addressed, but this isn't a jail, and we can't keep you here...
You've had a series of parenchymal hemorrhages.<eos> You just learn that word?<eos> They're small bleeds in your brain caused by multiple concussions.<eos> I hit hard.<eos> Well, the blows to your head have created a serious problem.<eos> Darius said he's got medicine.<eos> The medication will mitigate it, yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> So, can I get out of here now?<eos> You need to know that the medication should stop the seizures, but it won't reverse the damage that's already been done.
[distorted male voice] Attention, Space Inc., dismantle your plans for the prince's launch immediately.<eos> There will be devastating consequences for people around the world if Prince Xander's flight is not canceled.<eos> -That's all I can say. -[cell phone beeps]<eos> Well, I'm totally creeped out.<eos> Well, the office gets crazy messages like this all the time.<eos> Everyone just thinks it's a hoax.<eos> And you?<eos> I'm not so sure.<eos> You know, last night, I accidentally left my laptop at the office closed.<eos> And this morning, it was open.
I have so much to live for because of you.<eos> * You're sweeter than the taste * - * of honey * - Don't breathe.<eos> - I'm trying.<eos> - Don't talk.<eos> * And I'm so glad * - * that you're mine * - Babe.<eos> The police think you're dead.<eos> We need to use that to our advantage.<eos> - * You're sweeter than the chance * - Why... why don't we get out of town?<eos> I have a plan, and it doesn't include running.<eos> It involves you staying very, very still.
It's the only way he can get you into bed.<eos> But he should not have called you a slag.<eos> I'm definitely gonna take the piss out of him for that.<eos> _<eos> Watch the wife.<eos> I'm going to the market.<eos> Not without covering your head.<eos> If you want to leave this house, you will wear your hijab.<eos> I'm sorry, Doku, no.<eos> I don't like what it represents or the man you are becoming.
Now, you're on your way to a cozy six by eight.<eos> He used her.<eos> The sicker she looked the more money the two of you raised.<eos> Her losing all that weight, her hair,<eos> Ted decided that for her.<eos> So many lies!<eos> Yes, but what you and Nina shared, that was not a lie.<eos> She was doing it for you and the Warriors.<eos> She was desperate to be a part of something, to have a friend like you.<eos> All the money we raised, will it still go to the children?
No. God, it's...<eos> It's not that at all, and I'm sorry.<eos> Whatever you wanna do...<eos> I'll be with you every single step of the way.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, I still wanna go to Italy, you know, weigh my options, and we can just decide when I get back.<eos> I'll be waiting here when you do.<eos> Leave if you don't want to see me pee.<eos> You're leaving tomorrow and you don't know where your passport is?<eos> I'm pretty sure it's at my mom's house.
You know, you look familiar.<eos> Oh, I-I think I just have one of those faces.<eos> No, I-I think I've met you before.<eos> I remember now-<eos> - I offered to buy you a drink at the Corridor.<eos> Oh, right, yeah.<eos> Yeah, small world.<eos> Hey, I just got a hit on Tracy's cell phone.<eos> Look, she's traveling south on Route 15 in Virginia.<eos> She must have changed her phone number because it's still off-line.
Fortunately, they have a noble and wise father.<eos> Yet no mother.<eos> Come with us.<eos> Prove to my people that the Omec can at long last live side-by-side with Votans, as equals.<eos> The past need not define the present.<eos> You do me great honor...<eos> but my home is here.<eos> Here?<eos> Among people that call you traitor?<eos> Your husband, it is dead.
Do I look as though I have just beamed from the planet Vulcan?<eos> No, I wear these clothes to honor the men who fought so this country could be born.<eos> Mm-hmm, okay.<eos> Dude, I like it.<eos> I'm Agent Abbie Mills of the Westchester field office FBI, and this is...<eos> My name is Ichabod Crane, of the Hudson Valley Historical Society.<eos> We hear you have a headless body on your hands.<eos> It may be connected with a series of unsolved homicides.<eos> That body is material evidence in our ongoing murder investigation.<eos> It's not going anywhere.
Hide your jewelry.<eos> Jail bus coming in. I've got it.<eos> Dr. Lorenson, let's go.<eos> 38-year-old male. unconscious, labored breathing --<eos> He's uremic.<eos> Kidney failure. I know this guy.<eos> Let's get him set up for an I-stat.<eos> - We need his electrolyte levels.<eos> - Yes, doctor. What are we most concerned about in renal failure?<eos> Potassium, if it's too high, it could be toxic for his heart or put him into arrest.
Instead, we're going to start targeting your clients as acquisitions, and everyone we close leaves you and comes right over to me.<eos> And now all the partners will know why it's happening.<eos> And your puppet, Jack Soloff, tells the partners,<eos> "If we let you back, the bleeding stops."<eos> Which is why I'm here.<eos> To thank you.<eos> It would be so much less delightful if you had just said yes right away.<eos> Well the least you could do is tell me your first target.<eos> I'll give you a hint.<eos> It's one that's gonna hit you right where it hurts.
Okay?<eos> Okay, so, look at this tattoo.<eos> Starts with 399, has a bunch of letters just jumbled up in between, and then it ends with seven.<eos> Do you see that?<eos> Who here knows what a Vigenere cipher is?<eos> Put your hand down.<eos> It's a polyalphabetic substitution code.<eos> Yes, awesome.<eos> A Vigenere cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text based on the letters of a key word.<eos> And unless you have the key word, it is next to impossible to decode.
We've never dispensed ordinance domestically.<eos> Until today.<eos> Gibson got control of one of these UAVs, how?<eos> He kidnapped the daughter of one of our avionics specialists, forced him to retrofit a drone with an alternate control card that severed its signal with our satellite, allowing Gibson to take over remotely.<eos> And where is that girl now?<eos> We believe Gibson still has her.<eos> And the drone... can you recover control, locate it?<eos> He's frozen us out.<eos> And it was designed to evade radar detection.<eos> It still has another two missiles, but I've got my entire team working on it.
Now, go home and get some sleep.<eos> (grunts)<eos> I, uh...<eos> I just wanna say thank you for not trading me to Carter today.<eos> For a second, I thought that you were maybe considering it.<eos> Rest up.<eos> Tomorrow's another day.<eos> This really wasn't necessary.<eos> It's more for me than you.<eos> I just wanna check out the new place, make sure it's okay.
You're saying I'm a liar?<eos> No, I'm saying that you were probably conned by someone who claims they work for the NSA.<eos> (scoffs) Of course the NSA told you that Leonard doesn't exist.<eos> His job is like 100 levels above your clearance.<eos> Look at these.<eos> They're recent crimes targeted at government vehicles... which were located by your software.<eos> No.<eos> (Weller) Yes.<eos> No, my... my software isn't real.<eos> It was just a proof of concept.
(Weller) Yes.<eos> No, my... my software isn't real.<eos> It was just a proof of concept.<eos> It wasn't for people to actually use.<eos> Well, "people" are using it.<eos> Did you ever meet Leonard Gail in person?<eos> No.<eos> You didn't give your software to the good guys.<eos> You gave it to someone very dangerous.<eos> And every second it's out there, more lives are at risk.
Her last name is on my back.<eos> Look, I appreciate everything that you've done for me, everything that you're doing.<eos> But I just...<eos> I don't know, I...<eos> I need room to breathe.<eos> Hey.<eos> Do you have a minute?<eos> Sure.<eos> Uh, it's about Saul Guerrero.<eos> His case number is on Jane's body, and I've been digging through his file, but it's pretty redacted.
What makes you ask that?<eos> Because he's pushing me away.<eos> And that upsets you?<eos> Perhaps Agent Weller is feeling the same need for boundaries.<eos> (knocking on door)<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Patterson needs to see us right now.<eos> She's not picking up her cell.<eos> I think the hack was an S.O.S.<eos> How do you know it was her?
Figure out that steganography yet?<eos> What?<eos> The black square on your shoulder.<eos> Steganography?<eos> (Patterson) Steganography, of course.<eos> Can you fill the rest of us in?<eos> It's a... a method of concealing messages in innocuous images.<eos> It's used by spy services, terrorists... it dates back to the Ancient Greeks.<eos> So the black isn't just covering the Navy SEAL tattoo underneath.<eos> Oh, well, that's the thing, it's not all black.
Oh, well, that's the thing, it's not all black.<eos> Some of it's off-black.<eos> So, uh, if you isolate those sections and change their values to white...<eos> (gasps)<eos> The mask isn't covering the message.<eos> The mask is the message.<eos> It's a classic puzzle trick.<eos> The dead space is always a clue.<eos> Do you know what it means yet?<eos> I mean, it looks like a turtle shell, but that's not very helpful.

I shouldn't have said that.<eos> I was upset.<eos> You might be right.<eos> Maybe there's too much baggage between us.<eos> Or maybe the baggage is what makes you the right guy for the job.<eos> Who else is more invested?<eos> Do you want me to give you a lift home?<eos> My security detail's downstairs.<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> It is on my way home.
When my dad asked me what I planned to do with myself, I actually had something to say.<eos> Then time passes.<eos> Everyone around you starts to grow up, and when your break is slow to come, people fall away.<eos> - Eli, the guy I started the band with, - _ he was the first to quit.<eos> It starts to feel like no one told you you were playing a game of musical chairs.<eos> Get a job, get married, get a life, what are you waiting for?<eos> The song is gonna stop playing any second now.<eos> So that's the thing.<eos> I wouldn't really call it a band, per se.<eos> It's a project, um, and it has its own name, but...
Gido.<eos> I know this sounds crazy.<eos> It is crazy.<eos> The truth is, regardless of the risks, this is our only chance.<eos> Gido, I'm...<eos> I'm dying.<eos> I can't live without my Kohana.<eos> Do what you need to do.<eos> The path will help guide the polio to the tumor?<eos> Yes, and it needs to be exact.
This is half of our tribe.<eos> Gordon, I mean Red Hawk, and my dad don't exactly see eye to eye.<eos> My dad was Chief and CEO of the casino.<eos> When the apocalypse happened, half of them stayed with my dad while the other half followed my brother up here to where our ancestors first settled.<eos> So what does zen... Di... go mean exactly?<eos> Right.<eos> It can mean a lot of things.<eos> But it usually refers to the disease of the soul.<eos> It's when a person takes without regards to the damage it causes to others.<eos> But it really never fills the hole inside of them.
They will kill all of you.<eos> It's time for you to lead us out of here.<eos> I'm not coming.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You can't stay here.<eos> This is my life here.<eos> Your mother and I built this place with our bare hands.<eos> Her spirit rests here.<eos> This place is sacred too.<eos> It is stronger than a million zombies!
I mean there must have been places for you to stay along the way.<eos> I promised a friend I'd get him to California.<eos> Gives me some place to go.<eos> Some place to go.<eos> I like the sound of that.<eos> Help!<eos> Somebody help!<eos> God damnit.<eos> Hey, where'd that shot come from?<eos> It came from here.
Could I ask you to come in here and join us in the trust circle?<eos> We're gonna resolve this conflict peacefully.<eos> Without violence.<eos> Well that's not gonna be easy.<eos> Considering one of you just shot one of us.<eos> Do you have any proof of that?<eos> Okay, listen. Everyone.<eos> Violence can spread like wildfire.<eos> It just takes one spark to burn down the bridges of trust between all of our fellow human beings.<eos> And once it's started, a fire doesn't care who it burns.
I wanted to see how you'd feel about me asking for Ted's help.<eos> Ted's a good man.<eos> Do what you have to do.<eos> It's Holden.<eos> He says it's a surprise.<eos> I can't do it, I'm hungover.<eos> Those guys wear me out.<eos> Awkward.<eos> Look, James, a dinosaur.<eos> It looks just like you.
I told you I didn't give a shit about your reign and I don't!<eos> We both know you won't be around for long anyway.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> It means you're a cancerous dead king walking.<eos> Which also means there's a God.<eos> Get out!<eos> Or I'll have you removed by palace guards!<eos> You listen to me, little man!<eos> The monument is going to happen!<eos> No, it isn't!
-I thought you said "a little eruption." -[alarm blaring]<eos> -I might have overshot it a bit.<eos> -[McKeyla] That was awesome!<eos> Central, this is George in North One.<eos> We have a possible break and entry.<eos> So, Bry Bandweth from Maywood Glen, do you pick door number one, door number two or door number three?<eos> Ooh! I don't know. I like the number one, but two could be twice as promising,<eos> -and then there's three--<eos> -Door number three it is!<eos> [Cam] It's a voice-recognition lock.
- Pray for their souls.<eos> - Beocca:<eos> When you are ready...<eos> I would like to say a prayer for Uhtred, son of Uhtred.<eos> I must search for Mildrith.<eos> - She may be dead and unburied.<eos> - You shouldn't, no.<eos> No.<eos> She has buried your son with care, and she has left this place.<eos> It was no longer home for her anymore.
Please turn that off.<eos> We showed him the blood stains on the lock yesterday.<eos> He ridiculed us.<eos> My uncle finally broke the lock.<eos> Mr. D K Gogia...<eos> Retired police officer.<eos> He came as soon as I called him.<eos> Identify the body please.<eos> Took it from all angles?<eos> It does look like Khempal...
Or the torture and injustice that the parents have been put through...<eos> One won't be able to make amends for it...<eos> Even"<eos> Ashwin...<eos> Have you seen the statue of justice?<eos> It is blindfolded... ..and one hand holds a weight balance...<eos> People often don't notice that the other hand holds a sword.<eos> The sword in the hands of justice is us... us cops...<eos> But in the last 60 years, the sword has become rusty...<eos> And until the rust is cleaned off, this is how it will be... how it will stay.
Can you hand me my bag?<eos> Well, do we even know where we are?<eos> GPS can't even find us on my phone.<eos> No, we're not on a private road, we're in the middle of a state highway right now.<eos> Why is it so hot?<eos> We can't help you.<eos> Well, yeah, thanks for nothing.<eos> Best of luck.<eos> The closest place is four hours from here.<eos> And it's closed.
You can leave your stuff everywhere.<eos> - Hey, sweetie.<eos> - Hey, honey.<eos> I'm so glad that we got to do this before you start school.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> - Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay?<eos> We still have this one last weekend to have fun.<eos> Play games and puzzles, make s'mores, with our little girl.<eos> It's just exciting, sweetie.<eos> Well, we all know the past can be a piece of shit sometimes, but when it catches up to you, you'd better be ready.
Uh, I found her.<eos> I think she may have shot herself.<eos> I don't even know where she found a gun.<eos> Zach.<eos> Gunshot.<eos> B.P.'s 155 over 90.<eos> Pulse is steady.<eos> Pupils are fixed and dilated.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means her brain isn't sending the responses it should be.
Come on, George.<eos> Third time's a charm.<eos> Charge to 30.<eos> Discharge.<eos> Asystole.<eos> We got a stone heart.<eos> It's not salvageable?<eos> How does that happen?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe it was on ice too long in transit.
She needs to be strong right now.<eos> Her health is the priority.<eos> Is it gonna work?<eos> Vent on.<eos> Leave some blood behind.<eos> What's happening?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yes.<eos> My heart, it took.<eos> It did.
No, no.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> You don't need any more laugh lines, believe me.<eos> Me? Have you looked at yourself in the mirror lately?<eos> I love you so much, I want to break you in half.<eos> I love you so much, I want to punch your face in.<eos> All right, back to work.<eos> We might hit code black tonight.<eos> You got that, boss.<eos> Well, you qualify for tPA, and we're still inside the window for it to be effective.
Hey, Leonard!<eos> When you're done, we came up with a bunch more.<eos> Then the Czech Republic says to Slovakia,<eos> "I don't think you understand how being broken up works!"<eos> Can you believe that?<eos> You'd think that the Czech Republic would try to hold on to what it had, given that it's not as young as it used to be.<eos> And I don't see any other countries lining up to invade its southern borders.<eos> I'm gonna kill him.<eos> But enough about the Czech Republic.<eos> Let's talk about the time Moldova made Romania a birthday cake and Romania said it tasted good even though it didn't.
And whenever you're ready, there and there.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, girls. No, no, no. Not a good time, not a good time.<eos> Wasn't daddy supposed to be driving you to our game?<eos> Daddy's been a little bit busy himself dealing with linens that no guest has ever called scratchy before.<eos> Is there a way to make the room not so cold?<eos> Do you know what it's like to wake up next to your husband one morning and he's cold as ice?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah, I'll work on that while you eat breakfast.<eos> - Did you make the French toast?<eos> - Yes, it's right on the counter.
What's the odd part?<eos> He was shot dead yesterday morning, which lines up almost precisely with when McCall and his merry men arrived in town.<eos> McCall is using him to cover his tracks.<eos> Did you say the plane's flying from the Mojave?<eos> An old aircraft boneyard 15 miles north of your position.<eos> I know where that is.<eos> I got the diamonds.<eos> All right, let's get this thing in the air.<eos> Cassandra, I found the plane.<eos> It's about to...
Joke, I'm kinda married.<eos> Yeah. Caroline, how about I create a juice for you that will optimize your workout?<eos> Has he ever bought us a juice?<eos> No, and we bought him a car.<eos> Schiller, dude, give me a life boost.<eos> Schiller, I'll have the life boost as well.<eos> Schiller. Am I saying that right? Schiller.<eos> Will you be in class tomorrow?<eos> I'd love to see your flying lotus.<eos> My lotus only has a one-day pass, and it doesn't fly, it takes the bus.
Give me your phone.<eos> I want to make sure you aren't calling anyone who might be on their way over here right now.<eos> Many words have been written about the death of David Williams.<eos> And there will be many more written.<eos> Of loss, love, and hurt... that cannot be spoken.<eos> Natalie, if you receive this package, it means I'm dead.<eos> Even worse, I have failed.<eos> I'm sorry you have to see these photos, but you'll know what to do.<eos> Take care.<eos> The world is not what it seems.
And I said yes to my mother's plan.<eos> And became Queen.<eos> Glamor and the status.<eos> Yes.<eos> After a while, it mattered.<eos> I became a different person.<eos> But the girl who wanted the freedom to choose for herself...<eos> ..and a pebble set in an engagement ring... ..all she wanted was love.<eos> Well, you made the right call, Mum.<eos> To hell with love, it's a loser's game.
And now begins the ancient word.<eos> The sun sleeps below the sky, and the world turns upside down.<eos> In the night, we make our feast.<eos> For centuries, I danced for them, the blood-gatherer, the bringer of souls.<eos> I've brought them the lost ones, the troubled ones, the desperate ones.<eos> Now, I am free, and the world turns upside down again.<eos> They are thirsty for revenge, and nothing will stop them.<eos> No boundaries, no borders.<eos> They will come for me, but I am coming for them.<eos> Their empire of blood will fall, and will not rest until it all burns.
How can you possibly get any work done with so much visual noise assaulting you?<eos> That visual noise is my work, Mother.<eos> That's right, my daughter, what do they call you?<eos> The Proletariat Princess.<eos> Queen of All Media, Mother.<eos> So, what brings you to National City?<eos> Book tour.<eos> I edited Paget Willoughby's newest novel.<eos> Well, la-dee-dah.<eos> Perhaps you'll listen to it when it comes out in audio book form.
Turns out those two were trying to buy a $90,000 sports car with counterfeit cash.<eos> Ah, but here's where it gets interesting.<eos> The lab says that the money came from the same batch of bills that your old friend Miko Mosley was printing in his bathroom.<eos> Yeah, well, Miko was dropping that money all over the Island before he was killed-- guess it was just a matter of time before some of it started turning up.<eos> Okay, well, how does it all end up with these two dimwits?<eos> L-Like we told the sergeant, we didn't know the money was fake.<eos> We believe you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But here's the problem.<eos> The person that printed that money-- who, by the way, is dead-- was trying to use it to bankroll a drug operation, which is why we need to know how it ended up with you.
That's right-- followed by our Vic headed out to this secluded spot with a bag full of money.<eos> The whole thing adds up to just one thing.<eos> Crane was on his way to a ransom drop.<eos> This is a kidnapping.<eos> Jimmy, keep him on ice for me.<eos> You got it, Commander.<eos> All right.<eos> Let me know.<eos> All right, so the burner the kidnapper used had been turned off.<eos> CSU will track it if it powers back up.
Guys, it's working!<eos> "Touch my hand if you have the courage to be invisible.<eos> No cheating."<eos> It puts the tablet in airplane mode.<eos> Clever.<eos> Makes the kids untraceable.<eos> Invisible to anybody who wants to find them.<eos> That's also why Jacob's phone went off the network with Luke's.<eos> What about Luke's phone?<eos> Why did it end up in the fountain?
Look at this.<eos> I was looking at the art that our target posted on this... this fan site.<eos> I mean, it's disturbing, yes, but it's... clearly done with a sophisticated hand.<eos> I think maybe we're looking for an artist.<eos> An artist and a predator.<eos> Likely male.<eos> He's trolling the sites, searching for local kids who are obsessed with Red Crone.<eos> Selected Jacob and Luke... and tricked them into becoming his... unknowing victims.<eos> A problem, this... this fan site is a virtual attractive nuisance.<eos> It has hidden hazards that... that are attracting these kids.
You give me too much credit.<eos> Martha's been happily married for 20 years.<eos> Yes, poor Daniel Gascoyne happened to be standing in the right place at the right time to catch her fall.<eos> I've got nothing to be guilty about.<eos> Nobody said anything about feeling guilty.<eos> I've been in touch with their son, Taylor.<eos> Is he yours?<eos> [scoffing] No, I don't think so.<eos> I'm going to try and get a message back to Martha through him.<eos> I'm going to make a polite suggestion that you not make the situation any worse than it is.
I'm the biggest and most immune to hypothermia.<eos> You know if you leave, there's a good chance that you die before any of us.<eos> I'm the most expendable.<eos> I can't risk Happy and you.<eos> And you know the sub.<eos> Greater good.<eos> Greater good.<eos> The Navy isn't going to send a rescue unless the sub misses its rendezvous or there's proof of failure.<eos> The Navy has absolutely no evidence there's anything gone wrong with this mission.<eos> We were in communication with the sub when it went down.
Can we sneak across the border?<eos> This isn't the U.S. and Mexico. We'd get caught.<eos> There is dense forest in the country's interior.<eos> Maybe you could hide out there while Cooper sets up an extraction in a week or so.<eos> Maybe wait for things to calm down a bit?<eos> Hey, chief, where would one find a plunger?<eos> Not now.<eos> - We're not running, we're not hiding.<eos> And even if we could get out of here, that nuke sale would till go through, and the buyer ain't gonna be a decorator buying an accent piece.<eos> We might want to get out of here, but that missile-- we're gonna see it again, guaranteed, when it hits Atlanta, Chicago or L.A.
There are multiple steam tunnels crisscrossing between the buildings.<eos> If you can make it to building 28, there's a tunnel that runs 50 yards to the hatch that Happy spotted in the missile warehouse.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> So, back to problem solving 101.<eos> Once we're in, how do we disable a Soviet-era nuclear warhead resting on a flatbed truck with armed guards in the next room?<eos> Delicately.<eos> I could rewire it, but that just slows the bad guys until they find someone to fix it after we're gone.<eos> What if we just leave it where it is and neutralize it?<eos> Neutralize enriched uranium?<eos> Yeah, if you submerge uranium for two minutes in nitric acid, it will lose efficacy.
A little homemade neural interface.<eos> Kind of what we used back in the temple.<eos> Just, uh... not as perfected.<eos> As in, uh, a little pain?<eos> Um... maybe a lot.<eos> Here comes a pinch.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no.<eos> He's weaker than I thought.<eos> It's hurting him.
The Hawk-Eye pilot program.<eos> Lynn Dravecky is from central.<eos> She's gonna tell us more.<eos> Lynn.<eos> Machines know what people watch, what people read, what people buy, even what people feel.<eos> And now, they can tell us which people are a risk to public safety.<eos> Now, to be clear, this is not<eos> Precrime.<eos> The Hawk-Eye algorithm can't predict exact behavior.<eos> What it does do is notice patterns.
- In a safe, dry place.<eos> - Go get it.<eos> That's not going to happen.<eos> Because I like you, Charlie, and I don't want to see you die.<eos> Die?<eos> If you take your money, you'll go to a woman's house in Glenville, 73 miles from here.<eos> Lauren-something...<eos> I didn't get a last name.<eos> You're not going to be wearing what you have on now.<eos> Lauren kept your Naval Academy sweatshirt because it still smelled like you.

She was okay joining you?<eos> It was her idea, actually.<eos> She'd done it before.<eos> She was in another group marriage?<eos> Arrangements like ours happen more often than people think.<eos> For some people, it just works.<eos> It worked for Abby.<eos> Mostly.<eos> Her last marriage was a bad one?<eos> It ended badly.

Dinner.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> Hey, Ethan, you finish your homework?<eos> Can I do it in the morning?<eos> I'm exhausted.<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - The only reason you're exhausted is 'cause you stayed up all night with your uncle watching The Grinder; I don't want to hear it.<eos> - You're gonna do it tonight.<eos> - Hey, exhausted brain is a worthless brain;<eos> you got to let it work when it wants to work.
No, that's... exactly what I wanted to hear.<eos> Uh, Mr. Behar, did my clients' relationship<eos> - hurt the company in any way?<eos> - Objection... speculation.<eos> Noted, but your client still needs to answer.<eos> To my knowledge, no, it didn't hurt the company.<eos> Beautiful line of questioning.<eos> Yeah, incredible.<eos> The only problem is your clients' termination was perfectly legal.<eos> But what if it wasn't?
Zac needed me to get his idea out of his head and into virtually every computer processor on the planet.<eos> You hadn't had a big idea in over a decade.<eos> You used him.<eos> Used him?<eos> I helped him.<eos> Zac was lost without me.<eos> He would hyper-focus on one thing and ignore everyone and everything else.<eos> He was constantly losing his keys, his wallet, phone.<eos> You know where his phone is?<eos> No, but it doesn't surprise me that it's missing.
I'm afraid I am gonna do something stupid.<eos> Zac never played any of these?<eos> Oh.<eos> Wow.<eos> I tell you that I'm gonna kill myself... and you don't even call me?<eos> You really don't care if I live or die.<eos> That's it.<eos> That's the moment he gave up on living.<eos> But instead of taking his own life, he took Zac's.<eos> And that was the last voice-mail, after that it's just hangups.
The company paid for it.<eos> W-wait.<eos> That means I paid for it.<eos> To closing the case.<eos> To generous expense accounts.<eos> So, any progress with Beckett?<eos> You know, at the prison, we, um, sort of had a moment.<eos> Really?<eos> I think my plan is working.<eos> I mean, it has to, right?
The President would love to visit the Wind River Mountains.<eos> He's heard they're beautiful and worthy of national park status.<eos> How does, uh, next Tuesday look for a helicopter tour?<eos> I've done a bunch of research and I jotted down some ideas for your Cuba speech.<eos> - I told you...<eos> - You're writing the speech.<eos> I know, but I have an idea that I wanted to swing by you.<eos> You're adorable.<eos> - I am?<eos> - You disagree with the policy but you still want to write the speech anyway because you think it may just have become historic.
Oh, right, right.<eos> Our target.<eos> He infected the camera's charger with malware, and then snuck it into the precinct.<eos> Once he found out what type of body cams they used, he copied the packaging, disguised himself as a delivery man, and dropped off the infected hardware.<eos> He was in and out in under a minute.<eos> Then, when it was plugged in, it began crawling through the network until it found the chief's computer and took over.<eos> See, that's why we didn't see any evidence of suspicious devices.<eos> He used one that belonged.<eos> So it wasn't tampered with?<eos> Not physically, but inside, it's crawling with compromise.
I have just the man for you, Doctor Kurian.<eos> He's still alive?<eos> Not for long.<eos> He's perfect then.<eos> You have your volunteer.<eos> All ready, my queen.<eos> My friends.<eos> We stand on the precipice of a major scientific discovery.<eos> Remember this day.<eos> For it will mark the beginning of a New World Order.
You can't ask me to do nothing.<eos> He kidnapped my wife, my baby girl.<eos> It's him.<eos> I'm gonna do you a favor.<eos> Shot them right there in front of me.<eos> My savior.<eos> The zombie plague is over.<eos> I have the cure.<eos> Remember this day.<eos> For it will mark the beginning of a Zero World Order.
The human heart... best built machine not built by man.<eos> It's a beautiful thing, even when it's sick, flawed, like mine.
Oh. But I didn't know you were a cheat.<eos> Setting side bets with the gamblers... breaking the rules of the House... mm.<eos> Now, where is the honor in that?<eos> Why do you care?<eos> You work for the gamblers.<eos> I work for the House. And although it's obligated to keep the gamblers happy, it's also meant to keep them in line.<eos> The first time you won a match against me, uncle told you a story.<eos> While on a hunt, a king goes down by the river to fill his cup with water.<eos> This hawk swoops in and spills it on the ground.<eos> The king warns this hawk not to do it again, but it doesn't heed his warning.
That narrows it down to half of Los Angeles.<eos> Precisely.<eos> Got to be honest, this guy was thinking.<eos> Even if Sam and Callen could get a shot off, they're not gonna take it.<eos> There's too many kids. Yeah, but they still would have tried to take him down.<eos> Which means if they didn't, he probably had backup.<eos> Or another target wired to blow.<eos> Maybe Eric was able to track them from here.<eos> Hey, so out of curiosity, what do you think of this neighborhood?<eos> It's fine.
Where's this photo from?<eos> When we were at dinner last month, a lady came to our table.<eos> She wanted to talk to Zahra about modeling.<eos> Zahra got in contact with her?<eos> Yes.<eos> But all that came of it was some photo shoot.<eos> I don't think they've spoken again since then.<eos> Zahra never mentioned her name again.<eos> Uh, Allison,<eos> I think it was.

Uh, I looked into the founder, Allison Nelson, the CFO, Andrew Kim, and the photographer, Perry Gaffney, as well as the models.<eos> Nothing screams or even whispers ISIS sympathy.<eos> This agency's the black hole in Zahra's life.<eos> This could be the reason she got on that plane to Istanbul this morning.<eos> Uh, there is one other thing.<eos> They charge their clients steep commissions and are constantly hosting fund-raisers.<eos> I've seen Zahra's head shots, and the pixilation and printing quality is at least ten years old.<eos> That's odd.<eos> Well, then, we should follow the money.<eos> If it's not going back in the business, it's going somewhere.
We can't assume to know everyone.<eos> Not even those we're closest to.<eos> (Eric sighs)<eos> Gosh.<eos> I had no idea how many young women are reported missing each week.<eos> I know.<eos> It's disturbing.<eos> In other news, I've been digging into the modeling agency's finances.<eos> For all their commissions and fund-raising, it looks like they have nothing in their bank accounts.<eos> They're withdrawing money as soon as it comes in.
These girls are gonna be sold, whipped, stoned to death.<eos> Then they must have done something to deserve that punishment.<eos> I can only guide these girls towards a more righteous path.<eos> What happens after that is on them.<eos> There's Gaffney's car.<eos> Right where Eric said it would be.<eos> He's about to come back.<eos> His time's running out.<eos> Ah, points for the double entendre.<eos> It's only a double entendre if the second meaning is risqué.

I don't know.<eos> But it'd be a lot easier if I didn't have to find out.<eos> Well, picture the layout.<eos> Remember when you walked in?<eos> You walked through the whole place.<eos> You know exactly where everything is.<eos> That room where they're giving the flu shots.<eos> It's right next door.<eos> If I can get in there, I'll have access to the hallway that leads out of here.<eos> That wall... it cuts the ceiling tiles off right in the middle.
Wait. If you're saying that Fisher wasn't the target, then who was?<eos> So who is she?<eos> I got my pill and I listened to them try and figure out who the real target was.<eos> Whoever that woman is, it seems obvious she's the target.<eos> But there's one thing we forgot.<eos> Genghis Khan.<eos> He spread his genes everywhere, but the marker he passed was patrilineal, which means...<eos> That woman isn't the target.<eos> The Genghis Khan marker can only be passed through men.<eos> So even if she has the virus, there's no way it manifests as anything other than the flu.
That's you.<eos> See the birthmark?<eos> That virus your lab made, it's a massive breakthrough.<eos> And there's no way you destroyed your research, which means... the proof that you did this is somewhere in the building.<eos> This meeting is an opportunity for you to give us those files.<eos> If you don't, we can take that picture to a judge and get a warrant, but then you've lost your only chance to cooperate.<eos> You'll be facing three charges of murder.<eos> If you can get a judge to believe that's me, you have evidence of what?<eos> The fact that I used an aerosol can?<eos> The virus, if it exists, leaves no trace of itself behind.
You did? Wow.<eos> You must love that.<eos> You're so good at making the news... not boring?<eos> Thank you.<eos> That is the goal.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't know though.<eos> - Still no promotion, huh?<eos> - No. Um, there is a segment producer that's supposed to leave in May, and they say that the job is mine, which is great, uh, except my landlord is selling my building.<eos> - And it was rent-controlled.
Raymond Dell!<eos> I recognize you from your pictures.<eos> You're Paul Wilkerman's probate attorney.<eos> The super said that you were out here looking through my garbage.<eos> Actually, it's not your garbage anymore, not once you put it out here.<eos> Can I ask why the FBI is looking through my trash?<eos> I'm sure you already know this.<eos> Police found fingerprints from a guy named Arthur Maciel at the scene of your client's murder.<eos> They arrested him, but, interestingly, someone else's DNA was found under Paul Wilkerman's fingernails.<eos> And once we realized Wilkerman's kids still stood to inherit the money, we thought maybe it came from one of them.
So, counselors, call your first witness.<eos> Why does he get to go first?<eos> I'm doing it alphabetically.<eos> Eh. Convenient.<eos> Cary, what are your grievances?<eos> How are you... aggrieved?<eos> He's embarrassing in front of clients.<eos> That's code for "old."<eos> And he sticks his nose<eos> - where it doesn't belong.
It's not normal.<eos> It does all kinds of things.<eos> Like what? Okay.<eos> You lift this. Yeah.<eos> I already did that.<eos> I got more.<eos> This leaves an oil slick.<eos> This blows out smoke big time, but you breathe it, and it knocks you down.<eos> Over here is your Internet connection.<eos> Your satellite tracking system, I mean, it can find any phone number any time anywhere.
So we ID these women, we find out who they came in contact with, and that's how we find our killer, all right?<eos> Thanks, Max. Oh, a-actually, uh, there is one more thing.<eos> What's up?<eos> I'm just perplexed at the apparent lack of curiosity regarding my costume.<eos> You're wearing a costume?<eos> Ah, there it is.<eos> A pithy retort laced with just a hint of condescension.<eos> Order is restored.<eos> Okay, who is it?<eos> Oh, you want us to guess who it is.
Vampires.<eos> Someone was in a hurry.<eos> Looks like they took most of our packed cells of Jk3-negative.<eos> Oh, that's really rare.<eos> Impressive.<eos> He's right.<eos> Jk3-neg is only found in one in 10,000 people in Hawaii, mainly Polynesians and Asians.<eos> So, blood that rare could be a black market play.<eos> Only its value comes with an expiration date.<eos> Unless it's refrigerated correctly, it has to be hung within 30 minutes of leaving here.
There's one here and one in the upper abdominal region.<eos> I also found several small nicks to the cortical bone on the left tenth and 11th ribs.<eos> Knife wounds to the chest could mean the victim was stabbed to death.<eos> The predation seems particularly aggressive in the regions closest to the stab wound.<eos> It's possible the blood from the wound drew the fish to those areas first.<eos> I'll take a Mikrosil mold of the nicks to see if I can identify the weapon that caused it.<eos> You may not need to.<eos> The tip of the knife.<eos> It's lodged in the victim's tenth rib.<eos> Yeah, it probably broke off during the stabbing.
Which may have led to a murder.<eos> When's the last time you saw Lindsay?<eos> Couple weeks ago, we did an interview for the documentary's DVD extras.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You've done what?<eos> Two movies since your documentary with Lindsay?<eos> Three if you count my short.<eos> You've still got her pictures up?<eos> The film was my baby.<eos> It holds a very special place in my heart.
4 cases in 9 years.<eos> How come this hasn't been on our radar?<eos> Because the disappearances were in different states with different M.O.S.<eos> The first missing woman was Kathy Miller from NYU in 2006.<eos> So what's the plan once we land on campus?<eos> Track Bahni's movements.<eos> Campus police checked her room. She's not there.<eos> They taped it off for you.<eos> What about her cell phone?<eos> It just pinged in her room overnight.
How's the stomach?<eos> Hmm.<eos> Badly perforated.<eos> Gonna have to work on closing up these holes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'd add that to his liver and his bowels.<eos> How are his lungs doing, Sharpe?<eos> He's holding up for now.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm gonna have to sacrifice a huge part of this liver, but we can leave enough for it to regenerate.
What have you done with Vicky?<eos> Where is she?<eos> Have you killed her, like the kids?<eos> Child, adult, man, woman...<eos> No difference.<eos> You don't think of that when you kill.<eos> You know that, if you've been to war.<eos> They weren't in a war.<eos> They were prey.<eos> A wolf doesn't care what its prey thinks, it kills it.
Got to have the doors open, McGee.<eos> The Ebola quarantine sealed the lab perimeter.<eos> For some reason, my people can't get access to the system to override it.<eos> It's Abby.<eos> She locked out the system.<eos> I recognize this anywhere, boss.<eos> This is the Sciuto Special.<eos> She has her own personal security hash.<eos> Bypass it.<eos> I can try, but it's Abby.

Dammit.<eos> This guy's way ahead of us.<eos> Roger that.<eos> Widen the perimeter. Okay.<eos> Absolutely nothing.<eos> No blood, no fluids, nota.<eos> Well, it's not a total loss.<eos> Reynaldo just said that that they found trace from remnants of a body in the surrounding grounds.<eos> - It's gone now.<eos> - Well, of course, it is.
The Cabal hired him to do what she's being framed for-- the Orea bombing, the senator's murder.<eos> Yeah, I know Karakurt.<eos> He's Russian garbage.<eos> Probably hitting some strip club in St. Petersburg right now.<eos> Karakurt betrayed his country.<eos> If he went back to Russia, the FSB would shoot him on sight.<eos> My intel says he's had extensive plastic surgery.<eos> He's trying to change his identity.<eos> Says here you had him in custody and you let him go.<eos> It also says Karakurt's sister is married to Charlie Volkens-- violent, unstable.
You mean, like a genie?<eos> All I know is, they believe she can help clear Agent Keen's name.<eos> The Djinn apparently grants your deepest, darkest wish.<eos> If you can imagine it and pay for it... she'll make it happen.<eos> How do you contact this...<eos> Djinn?<eos> Right.<eos> At the early days of the web, a virtual fantasy world was created online to connect people of all ages from around the world.<eos> The technology was quickly obsolete, but the site was never taken down.<eos> Today, it is a hidden oasis for freaks and weirdos.

I want to go to Liora's base.<eos> Oh.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> - She didn't answer you?<eos> - No.<eos> Let's just make sure she's there.<eos> - I can't, Mom, I have a friend over.<eos> - Your friend can wait.<eos> - What happened to the mirror?<eos> - It fell.

Oh, coming from her, that's high praise.<eos> - Hey, Beckett, I got something.<eos> - We've got something.<eos> Yeah, that's what I said.<eos> - That's not what you said.<eos> - Okay, it's what I meant.<eos> Okay, you both get gold stars for the day if just one of you can tell me what's going on.<eos> We did some digging into this painting's tortured history.<eos> Stolen during World War II.<eos> It ended up in a private collection before coming up for auction.
He's got a rock-solid alibi.<eos> Well, that makes sense.<eos> If he was willing to kill Justin, he'd already have the Van Gogh and he wouldn't have asked me to steal the fake one.<eos> Hold on.<eos> The Van Gogh you recovered is the forgery?<eos> How do you know about the forgery?<eos> Lorenzo, you are in a world of trouble.<eos> Your best bet is to tell us everything you know now.<eos> I have spent my entire adult life searching for that painting.<eos> When I heard it was coming up for auction, I tried to get my boss to buy it.
A guy named Carl Jacobs.<eos> Did any of you ever meet this Jacobs?<eos> No. No, but he promised we would once the operation was completed.<eos> Sorry, but given the facts, it's highly likely that this Mr. Jacobs was also a figment of Mr. Cullen's imagination.<eos> - Special Agent Jacobs?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We'll hear you over the phone and your I.D.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Yeah, I copied the CIA's watermark.<eos> It looks like... looks like the real thing.
- Thanks, thank you.<eos> Hey.<eos> You all set?<eos> All right, listen up.<eos> Bergstrom's reached out to the other two operatives.<eos> Why don't you tell them?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I left a coded message on Craigslist.<eos> "Missed Connection" board.<eos> It's how Cullen would reach out to us.

Which one of these computers controls the MRI?<eos> I've never seen it do this before.<eos> I can't stop it!<eos> I think they reversed the polarity of the magnet.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, are you?<eos> The MRI went crazy.<eos> The target shut down the superconducting coils and turned it into a magnetic weapon.<eos> I thought your program was supposed to wipe the malware from the system.<eos> It was.
Did it work?<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> Yes, it worked! It worked!<eos> Yes.<eos> High five, my man!<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Krumitz just sent us the patch!<eos> It's installing.

Okay.<eos> Walter, there's no more room over there.<eos> Get over here before you get hit.<eos> Almost done.<eos> O'Brien, move it!<eos> I can't believe it worked.<eos> I can't believe it worked.<eos> I can't believe it worked.<eos> I can't believe that worked.<eos> Paige, I got a good look at the train when it was passing, it's an A-250.

Okay, I'm running an analysis on the sound package from the last ping.<eos> The plane was tilting down when the last ping registered.<eos> A plane of that weight, cruising at that speed, yields a possible landing location of...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> That's Coughlan Air Force Base.<eos> That's Area 51.<eos> Secret spy mission in Area 51-- spooky.<eos> No pun intended.<eos> The base and several miles surrounding it are protected from eyes in the sky by ambient microwaves as an active defense system.<eos> It disrupts satellite, cell and radio communication.

Okay, son.<eos> Let's clear out of this plane now.<eos> Walter, what's the holdup?<eos> Hold on, hold on, hold on.<eos> One second.<eos> (Walter laughs)<eos> Oh, God...<eos> Storage capacity on this is almost two petabytes.<eos> Shouldn't be possible for a machine this small.<eos> It's ten years ahead of anything else on the market.

We can catch the son of a bitch ourselves.<eos> Sergeant, that's enough.<eos> - (man) Yo, that's our neighborhood.<eos> - (woman) That's right.<eos> We're here to help.<eos> We have the resources.<eos> You don't know the streets like we do.<eos> And we don't have targets on our backs like you do.<eos> I know you're upset, but one single misstep here could undo all the efforts that you've made to repair the relationships between you and this community.<eos> Your job today is the same as it always is.
Oh, this is a waste of time.<eos> I already spoke to our guys about this.<eos> Well, now, you can talk to us.<eos> Do you want to catch the person who killed your fellow officers or do you wanna posture?<eos> - Officer Dunn?<eos> - (sighs)<eos> I was NYPD.<eos> Five years at the Nine-Six.<eos> I lost a partner too.<eos> Routine traffic stop, it was over before we even knew what was happening.
Officer down, officer down.<eos> I repeat, officer down!<eos> (radio static)<eos> No, let her go.<eos> Just give her some time.<eos> We gotta go back through Schultz and Garrigan's bodycam footage, see what else we can find.<eos> You got it.<eos> Just FYI, it's a lot of footage.<eos> I'll round up as many eyes as possible to help.<eos> (Sofia) With Davenport's help this Daylight program, it could really work.
I knew him in a way that his father didn't.<eos> He was safe with me.<eos> Or at least I thought he was safe with me.<eos> The X-ray from the young man with the stray bullet.<eos> It hit his defib implant.<eos> You were right, Dr. Savetti.<eos> Well done.<eos> It was a single bullet.<eos> Looks like the implant deflected it away from his heart.<eos> We have to assume it's not functioning, right?
It was a single bullet.<eos> Looks like the implant deflected it away from his heart.<eos> We have to assume it's not functioning, right?<eos> We need a cardiologist to assess it, and they're swamped.<eos> Hello, James.<eos> I'm Dr. Hudson.<eos> When am I getting out of here?<eos> I got class in the morning.<eos> Your defibrillator implant sustained damage.<eos> It may not be functioning normally.
Is he gonna live?<eos> That piece of crap gonna live?<eos> Get Dr. Hudson in here.<eos> - What?<eos> - Get Neal, Jesse.<eos> Now, please.<eos> What's going on?<eos> His defibrillator just shocked him twice in 10 seconds.<eos> Heart rate's 160.<eos> It's malfunctioning.
His defibrillator just shocked him twice in 10 seconds.<eos> Heart rate's 160.<eos> It's malfunctioning.<eos> Make it stop before it happens again.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Try and calm down.<eos> - Do something!<eos> - Deep breaths.<eos> Tracing is normal.<eos> It shouldn't be shocking him.
You're gonna have to do it without me.<eos> Use the adhesive.<eos> Fix the rift!<eos> Save the universe, Dipper.<eos> Great Uncle Ford!<eos> Hang on, I'm coming for you!<eos> Don't worry, I'll get you out of there!<eos> Where's that thing taking you?<eos> It's an automated prison droid.<eos> And wherever it's going, I'm not coming back.
- I don't know.<eos> It's been two weeks since the fall ball, and she hasn't even talked to me... which is crazy because that mess was mad romantic.<eos> She punched me in the armpit.<eos> It was amazing.<eos> Yeah, that night was crazy.<eos> Becca T. and I split a Capri sun, and now she just walks around like nothing even happened.<eos> We shared a straw.<eos> I feel you.<eos> Sarah S. slapped a slap bracelet on me at the dance.<eos> Where is it now?

No one lives that long around me.<eos> MAN:<eos> What did Van Zant say?<eos> WOMAN:<eos> He said he was on his way.<eos> Hey, Cleo.<eos> (groans)<eos> Look who's awake.<eos> Those are the aftereffects of the chloromethane.<eos> It hits you like a freight train, but leaves you all twitchy.
They set us free.<eos> Yes, to leave, to stay far away.<eos> This world is not safe for us.<eos> For you, maybe.<eos> I'm doing fine.<eos> You want to risk our safety for some girl's you just met today?<eos> - She gave me her number.<eos> - Her number?<eos> What's that?<eos> I'm pretty sure it's a good thing.
I was in the clear before...<eos> Really?<eos> You're gonna blame Dash?<eos> Actually, I was gonna blame you.<eos> This is your fault and you know it.<eos> So you stole the money.<eos> Fine.<eos> - Let's just give it back.<eos> - Can't do that.<eos> It's all red diamonds in Hong Kong by now.
But you cleaned it up.<eos> Your way.<eos> But all that success went to your head.<eos> Got a little cocky.<eos> A little too greedy.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> No honor among thieves.<eos> Oh, that's ripe, coming from you.<eos> See, the reason I'm not going to give you your money back,<eos> Mr. Van Zant, is because it wasn't yours to start with.
I want to thank you for walking me through your Hawk-Eye program these last few weeks.<eos> You have something promising here, Lieutenant.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Henry.<eos> One last thing.<eos> Detective Vega.<eos> Yes?<eos> What about her?<eos> We've been impressed with her arrest record.<eos> It's not shoplifters either;
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I saved the life of the guy who did this to her.<eos> It doesn't.<eos> But thanks.<eos> So, do I win the guilt-off?<eos> Sure.<eos> What's my prize?<eos> Maggie pulls through.<eos> Dr. Reid?<eos> Hi.<eos> Yes, what is it?
I can't get a clear picture of my daughter right next door.<eos> This stupid piece of...<eos> Oh, my angel.<eos> Oh, babe.<eos> Okay. Thank you, Lord, for this food and our friends.<eos> - Amen. - Amen.<eos> Ange, I noticed you eyeing the Moo Shu.<eos> You want to put down that cup of algae and maybe get in on this?<eos> I desperately do, but I've only got 36 hours left of my cleanse, and mama's got to look good in her dress tomorrow night.<eos> But Daddy likes that booty the way it is.
My bossy ex-wife has a lot of rules.<eos> Well, it is "Las Leyes de Pasión."<eos> I'm Pasión.<eos> And one more thing.<eos> We don't do gum on the show.<eos> I hate the sound.<eos> I really didn't think that through.<eos> You think Xavier's hotter than me?<eos> Gael, come on, not this again.<eos> This is just like when we had that horse on set and you were worried it had better hair than you.
Let's focus-group the siblings, see how a mock jury responds... if they like 'em, hate 'em, think they're strange... because motive is everything in this case.<eos> If the prosecution invents a good one, we're screwed.<eos> Hell, we're already screwed.<eos> I got a gun, and I called the police!<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> - Frank wasn't picking up his phone.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> Here.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> It's suffering.
I like him.<eos> And I want to know more about him.<eos> Why is that so bad?<eos> You do like him.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> Me and Frank, we got a fight club.<eos> And the first rule is we don't tell you knuckleheads crap about each other.<eos> Hey, lazy, another round on her.<eos> Found your recorder.<eos> It's on the floor next to Bonnie's desk.
It's a side effect from one of the early vaccines given to everyone on Zona.<eos> But not you?<eos> I've never been.<eos> I've only seen the inside of this sub since we evacuated Mt. Wilson.<eos> How do you even know Zona's real then?<eos> I worked for some of the people who first founded Zona before the outbreak.<eos> They're the only ones left with enough power and resources to stop this plague.<eos> We almost had it.<eos> But the vaccine only slows down the virus.<eos> It doesn't kill it or make you immune.

No, not at the time, but...<eos> Newton might have been onto something.<eos> Because Dillon now works in the armory at Quantico.<eos> Anybody else coming in today?<eos> It's still early, boss.<eos> Yeah, Abbs. Yeah, yeah. Be right down.<eos> McGee, when DiNozzo gets in, you two go to Quantico.<eos> You talk to Master Sergeant Dillon.<eos> This little baby is really cool.<eos> It's GPS-enabled, and it keeps track of your distance jogged and your pace and time.

And that got me thinking.<eos> So I pulled her Maryland driver's license that she surrendered, and this is her new Virginia driver's license.<eos> Same woman, right?<eos> Yeah. That's what I thought.<eos> And probably what the DMV clerk thought, also.<eos> Same hairstyle, same hair color, the exact same glasses.<eos> But look what happens when we superimpose the photos on top of each other-- everything's a little off.<eos> The jawline, the shape of the nose...<eos> Check out the beauty mark.<eos> It moved 15 millimeters, Gibbs.
It's gotta be Roger Thrunk, doesn't it?<eos> We already know he's a murderer.<eos> Let's not forget Harry owed someone enough money that a goon was sent to collect.<eos> The man's a degenerate gambler.<eos> That was kind of his dominant personality trait, huh?<eos> This is gonna get ugly.<eos> Suzuki's widow gave you a brain?<eos> Yeah. In a piece of Tupperware.<eos> Like she was handing me cake.<eos> And you think it's human?

In a piece of Tupperware.<eos> Like she was handing me cake.<eos> And you think it's human?<eos> I do.<eos> But I can't ask our lab to test it without saying where it's from, and we're already in the doghouse for looking into Suzuki.

I guess if your mom's okay with it, I'm okay with it.<eos> Oh, um, and could you ask her for us?<eos> I'll give it a shot, but it'll be the second thing<eos> I've talked her into this morning, and it'll be a lot trickier now that she's fully awake.<eos> Hey, hon.<eos> Do you have a minute?<eos> Just.<eos> I can't be late to work.<eos> We are unveiling a new closet today -- the Trulhatten.<eos> It's Swedish, it's cheap, it's modern.
Oh, good.<eos> I thought I forgot someone's birthday again.<eos> Listen, there's something I want to talk to you about.<eos> Um, I got an offer to handle a case, but I'm a little worried about who it's for.<eos> What's the matter now?<eos> Killing whales?<eos> Drilling for oil?<eos> Child labor?<eos> 'Cause let me tell you something.<eos> I had a paper route when I was 7 years old, and you know what it gave me?
That Rolodex was full of A-list clients.<eos> Your Erik Estradas, your Fran Tarkentons, your Leslie Uggums.<eos> I'm sorry, are these real names?<eos> What about that probate?<eos> Who did you mess that up?<eos> Client's dead.<eos> Okay, this is crazy.<eos> Why am I worried about your feelings when you obviously have no concern for mine?<eos> Y-- [Snaps fingers] I'm taking that job.<eos> It's like a Hatfield working for a McCoy.
I wish I could!<eos> I really need you to get your own charger, honey.<eos> Oh, you're both in the bed together.<eos> - Dad, it's fine.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Our room is your room, Philibuster.<eos> Thank you, Dylan.<eos> Uh, anyway, just, uh, looking for my charger.<eos> Oh.<eos> Sorry, dad, it's not here.
Phil needed to do it.<eos> He needed to be as tough as that eagle on the Internet.<eos> Dumb otter never saw it coming.<eos> Oh, stop!<eos> That tickles!<eos> Uh!<eos> You all right, Phil?<eos> Yeah, just enjoying the movie.<eos> Oh, you are?<eos> It's not even scary.
Oh, stop!<eos> That tickles!<eos> Uh!<eos> You all right, Phil?<eos> Yeah, just enjoying the movie.<eos> Oh, you are?<eos> It's not even scary.<eos> Like, that is the lamest sea monster I've ever seen.<eos> That's 'cause you can see it.<eos> It is way scarier if you can only imagine what's going on beneath the surface.

Hi!<eos> Okay, Tandy, we're gonna have to add<eos> "no talking-slash-total silence" to your punishment.<eos> I'm just trying to spread good cheer.<eos> You know, show everybody how much I care about them.<eos> I'm not bothering you guys, am I?<eos> It has come to my attention that there has been some unhappiness with the volume and frequency of my heartfelt compliments.<eos> Carol?<eos> I had Carol go out to the pet store and get this new collar for me.<eos> It is voice activated, so whenever I speak, a burst of citronella will be shot out into my face, thus assaulting my senses and delivering the silence you requested
Should've looked after it better then, shouldn't they?<eos> What, like throwing a coat over him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> OK, thank you.<eos> We should be getting on.<eos> Yeah, can I...? Can I touch it?<eos> - Oh, now you want to touch it?<eos> - Yeah, of course.<eos> Always wanted one of these ever since I was a kid.<eos> It won't hurt you.
I think he's got company.<eos> Black van?<eos> Got it.<eos> Can't make out the plates.<eos> One of us'll have to go over there.<eos> Do you mean me?<eos> I'll keep an eye on this.<eos> And this one's of a little duckling.<eos> She rescued it last week.<eos> A cat dragged it in and it's still alive.
'Kilo Two Two Three, please respond, over.'<eos> - My reception's fine.<eos> - He was definitely doing house-to-house.<eos> - Saw him talking to the neighbours.<eos> - I'll call him on his job mobile.<eos> You know what he's like, he'll have turned his radio down, chatting to some old dear, mouth full of biscuits.<eos> GET THAT PHONE OUT NOW!<eos> GET IT OUT NOW!<eos> I can't reach it.<eos> It's in my pocket.
- Yummy.<eos> - I'm just trying to...<eos> You coming over?<eos> Oh, the cat.<eos> - I'll call you.<eos> - The cat?<eos> Don't call.<eos> Just come over.<eos> Jay, yo, I got a ping on Ethan's phone.<eos> It was moving, but now it has stopped.
It's he said, she said.<eos> But she's telling the truth.<eos> Or slandering a national icon.<eos> The media will tear Hannah apart.<eos> The university.<eos> We expose them for covering up for Holland.<eos> They're not.<eos> They don't have to.<eos> The system is set up to silence women like Hannah and protect men like Holland.<eos> It's not a cover-up.
Which is bad news for the two missing agents.<eos> They were both undercover.<eos> Yeah, John Portman vanished a week ago.<eos> And then Sarah Miles disappeared yesterday.<eos> All of these agents were investigating the Libertad drug cartel.<eos> Well, if someone knew that they were undercover, then there has to be a mole on the inside.<eos> Well, we have to consider all possibilities.<eos> This cartel is in fact unique in a few ways.<eos> Yeah, it appeared on the Darknet after the Silk Road was shut down.<eos> It has an online and an on-the-ground component based in El Paso.
What did I do that you missed?<eos> Uh, debride, hemostasis, close...<eos> Come on.<eos> Figure it out.<eos> I was watching you.<eos> I didn't see.<eos> Deluca, can you fill in the blanks?<eos> Um, Dr. Blake didn't tell you to clamp the hilum.<eos> Dr. Grey, the hilum is clamped.<eos> It is, sir, because I clamped it on my own.
Previously on "Blindspot"... (Mayfair) It's a Navy SEAL tattoo.<eos> If she was Navy, she'd be in our database.<eos> Not if she was special ops.<eos> (Jane) Something happened last night with Weller.<eos> (Borden) Your relationship with Agent Weller is complicated.<eos> Maybe you need to establish clearer boundaries.<eos> I think we need to consider you stepping down as lead agent on this case.<eos> It's not necessary.<eos> (Patterson) Saul Guerrero, his case number is on Jane's body.<eos> I've been digging through his file, but it's pretty redacted.
It is one thing if you won't admit it.<eos> It is something else if you don't even know it.<eos> What could you possibly be hoping to find this far into the forest?<eos> (Reade) He's got a point, we could be chasing our tails.<eos> No, the landmarks on the map have all been right so far.<eos> The sun's low.<eos> We head west, follow the light, the rendezvous point should be just around this next bend.<eos> (Reade) I hope you're right.<eos> She's right.<eos> It's just up ahead.
We should double back and wait for them.<eos> You're right.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> You twist your lips when you're writing.<eos> I twist my lips when I'm frustrated.<eos> Is this a code or is this a cipher?<eos> My code-breaking software is so much faster than we are.<eos> I should get this back to the lab.<eos> Hey, come on, your software can't stand in that arch and compare the bricks.<eos> And it can't pull this book off the top shelf and flip to the right page.
No. No, you're free to go.<eos> (sighing) Well...<eos> I think it's time we open that Blanton's your uncle gave you.<eos> I... I can't do this.<eos> You...<eos> I know you're different.<eos> Um, but I'm still the same.<eos> And I'm the reason that they move out.<eos> And this job... I love this job.<eos> But it takes all of me.
Uh, something on Ross's computer.<eos> He has a Fit-Step account.<eos> It's a digital pedometer that tracks how many steps you take every day.<eos> What's the big deal?<eos> I think I took about seven steps today.<eos> Wait, what's with the Fit-Step?<eos> It's just weird that he accumulated steps after he was murdered.<eos> The latest Fit-Steps have a GPS.<eos> If the killer took it, then we can track them down.<eos> Yeah, but it was accumulating steps for about six hours and then stopped.
No, I'm not living on the phone.<eos> Now I'm living inside the phone.<eos> The Ballon d'Or is obvious.<eos> I don't need to ask your opinion.<eos> But you'll be there on January 12th.<eos> Are you expecting an emotional reaction from Cristiano Ronaldo if he wins?<eos> I can only tell you I don't know what is going to happen.<eos> The only thing I can tell you is that there has never been a year like this one.<eos> The difference between first and second is so big that there is no doubt.<eos> And if Cristiano doesn't win, it would be best that they stopped doing this event, that it didn't appear any longer in the history of this trophy.
We're here to discuss Miss Sinclair's motion to include Helena Hapstall's testimony in the trial.<eos> I wasn't aware of any motion, your honor.<eos> Because my office only received it at 4:58 P.M. yesterday, two minutes before the deadline.<eos> So it would give me no time to challenge it.<eos> Challenge it now.<eos> We're all here.<eos> You were gaming the deadline, counselor, which gives me more than enough cause to reject this motion...<eos> But, judge...<eos> If I did not feel like this testimony is pivotal to your case.<eos> It is, your honor.
"did you hear anything odd the night before?"<eos> Her reply, "I heard screams at about 9:30 P.M."<eos> Notice a difference between that statement and the recording you just heard, Detective?<eos> I wasn't at the crime scene.<eos> I can't speak to what was said there.<eos> But it was only during your interview that Miss Hapstall claimed to hear anything that night, which I can only assume means that you fed her the information.<eos> Your honor, it's just been brought to my attention that the dash-cam audio was not in discovery.<eos> Because it's exculpatory evidence that the D.A. didn't want us to hear.<eos> So you're admitting the recording wasn't in discovery, Miss Keating?<eos> All I know is that it showed up on my desk.
He must have lost everything.<eos> Aram, did you get those files?<eos> You've stumbled on a state-of-the-art virology shop.<eos> Matchett didn't steal verdiant's genome blueprint so he could release it publicly.<eos> He needed it to identify its weaknesses and design a virus tailor-made to destroy it.<eos> He wants to sabotage their gmo crop?<eos> 90% of all corn grown in America is genetically modified.<eos> Verdiant is the largest producer of it.<eos> In fact, this one strain is planted all over the world.<eos> If this virus gets out, it will spread fast.

Did you sleep at all?<eos> Don't sleep.<eos> Since when?<eos> Since my sister died.<eos> These photos are bringing everything back up.<eos> I keep thinking of the call I got from my mother, telling me that Emily had been killed.<eos> Before the call, I was this-this Agent Afloat, starting this new career.<eos> Life couldn't have been better.<eos> After the call, I live in this world where... I'll never see my sister again.<eos> If that call had to come, if it could have come a minute later, five minutes later even...
"Howard"?<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> Make room, Visigoths.<eos> 'Sup?<eos> We need to talk about redecorating this place.<eos> Oh, no, not this again.<eos> Look,<eos> I get that you grew up here and you're attached to things looking a certain way, but...<eos> I want this to feel like my house, too.<eos> Oh, honey, of course it's your house.
I did what I could.<eos> Seriously?<eos> You brought Raj over to take your side?<eos> Your dad's on your side.<eos> He's not on my side.<eos> He's doing all the work for free.<eos> That is so generous of you.<eos> I'd like to switch sides.<eos> Look, uh...<eos> I don't even think you can take this wall down 'cause it's load-bearing.
Great party, dude.<eos> Oh, hey, hey, I just want you to know, you put on a hell of a party.<eos> You're not bad at this grandpa stuff.<eos> Thanks, brother.<eos> Oh, I'm not your son.<eos> I'm your brother!<eos> Yo, G!<eos> Wait, hold up.<eos> Thanks for getting that chicken suit.<eos> It's a good look on you.
Todd! Todd!<eos> Todd! Todd! Todd!<eos> - Oh, you're the bacon man!<eos> - No, you're the bacon man.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I told you not to do this.<eos> Now they know about the bacon.<eos> What if they find out about the rest?<eos> It's all taken care of. All the evidence is gone.<eos> If you've got a bacon-sniffing dog out there, it wouldn't even notice.

Step one: the whaling attack on Barnaby Bank's CEO.<eos> Step two:<eos> use the CEO's credentials to own the bank's network.<eos> And step three: take control of the ATM through the network.<eos> That's how he shut off the cameras.<eos> All the target had to do was send him an e-mail pretending to be someone he trusted<eos> When Wagner clicked the link, the target got his login credentials, and just like that, he was inside the bank's network.<eos> Look at the transaction report from the ATM Andy used last night.<eos> At the exact same time the camera cut out, the ATM stopped recording customer transactions.<eos> Instead, it logged the message,
I went right to my boss.<eos> He dismissed me.<eos> Why didn't you go to law enforcement?<eos> That's what we're here for.<eos> Five years, I've been telling mothers who could barely feed their kids that I couldn't refund the excessive overdraft fees.<eos> I did what was right.<eos> I gave the poor a voice.<eos> And the people are supporting me.<eos> I started a movement.<eos> It will go on, with or without me.
HENRY:<eos> Your dad had a taste of that same medicine when I was PC.<eos> All the more reason to correct it.<eos> No, all the more reason to just bite that bullet.<eos> FRANK:<eos> There's an upside to being a cop named Reagan, so inevitably, there's a downside.<eos> FRANK:<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, but... (sighs) No buts.<eos> Pop, the roast looks beautiful, but it would look better in slices on our plates.
Soon as your alibi checks out, yeah.<eos> Of course, that could take a while.<eos> I were you, I'd get cozy.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, you can't keep me in here.<eos> That's illegal.<eos> Come on, Frankie.<eos> You never let the law get in your way.<eos> Why start now?<eos> WARREN: Hey.<eos> I've reassembled the skull, and it is ready for its close-up.
A formula that I've been working on.<eos> Oh, this sounds too risky.<eos> Mr. Kebler, if you do nothing, your wife will die.<eos> What are you risking?<eos> If I agreed, when would it start?<eos> Right now.<eos> I have everything I need in my vehicle.<eos> So, the Mad Scientist club.<eos> It sounds interesting.<eos> Yeah, it was fun.
If I agreed, when would it start?<eos> Right now.<eos> I have everything I need in my vehicle.<eos> So, the Mad Scientist club.<eos> It sounds interesting.<eos> Yeah, it was fun.<eos> What did you guys talk about?<eos> Um, advancements in medical research mostly.<eos> Stem cell, chromatin looping.<eos> Honestly, it was more of a drinking club after the first hour.

Oh, God.<eos> Guys, I think I know why the magic man thought this place is so magical.<eos> We are right around the corner from the legendary Fountain of Youth.<eos> Please, please let me go.<eos> I swear I won't tell anybody.<eos> You're beautiful.<eos> Your face is so youthful.<eos> Don't.<eos> Smooth and perfect.<eos> Soft, like it should be.
Smooth and perfect.<eos> Soft, like it should be.<eos> You know...<eos> When I was 7 years old,<eos> I went with my parents to visit an uncle who was living in a nursing home.<eos> I got lost for a minute.<eos> I went into the wrong room by mistake.<eos> I thought it was my uncle, but...it wasn't.<eos> He was terrible-looking.<eos> His face, it hardly looked human.
He hasn't had one for a while.<eos> I'll keep searching.<eos> Look, he's probably long gone, but we can see if Boles reports for his next shift at the hospital.<eos> He might not know we're onto him.<eos> Only one of Dr. Braga's patients didn't show up for their scheduled appointment in the last two days--<eos> Eileen Kebler.<eos> We need to check her residence.<eos> Down this way at the end of the hall.<eos> What is this place?<eos> It's a former medical research facility.
So thank you all for coming for this emergency meeting of the executive contract committee of the board of New York Symphony.<eos> Gloria, thanks for being here.<eos> I called the meeting.<eos> Okay, technically.<eos> Come on in, Gloria.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> I'm sorry if the decor in here isn't quite up to snuff.<eos> We'll get to work renovating it ASAP.<eos> I would like to apologize to my fellow board members for the article in the "Times."<eos> It misrepresented the facts.
Come on.<eos> Come on, come on, come on, come on.<eos> Come on... Oh, okay. Blanket, blanket.<eos> Oxygen.<eos> Okay... okay. There you go.<eos> All right.<eos> - I'll take him to the NICU.<eos> - I'll take him.<eos> She hasn't delivered the placenta yet.<eos> It has to come out.
And the best part is, you're teaching your kids to hate early.<eos> Okay, big man, the sooner you say no, the sooner we have pie and the sooner I watch "Wife Swap" and have more pie.<eos> - It's actually pretty clever.<eos> - Huh?<eos> - Are you sure no one's ever done that?<eos> - Why is he asking questions?<eos> - I've never seen it.<eos> - What's happening?<eos> What about the ink inside the diaper?<eos> Does it run?
Python must've put a tap on Interpol's dedicated fiber optic line, connecting its U.S. offices to European HQ... and started to steal data.<eos> This was fiber tapping.<eos> Flash Boys, Wall Street.<eos> Direct line, faster trades.<eos> Hey, Krumitz, you're not even completing sentences here.<eos> Okay, try this.<eos> Is this your soda?<eos> Yes it is.<eos> If I punch a hole...<eos> Okay, it's going to leak, so I will get less. Exactly.
Python created him.<eos> Everything about Henry Hayes is fake.<eos> He's a shelf baby.<eos> I'm sorry...<eos> are we chasing a ghost?<eos> More like a virtual identity created by a hacker.<eos> It's frighteningly easy to register a Social Security number, a birth certificate, even medical records... all in the name of someone who doesn't even exist.<eos> A hacker "gives birth" to a shelf baby, then waits-- in real time-- while it "grows up."<eos> Then, when the shelf baby turns 16, the hacker gives it a driver's license.<eos> When the shelf baby graduates high school, it gets a diploma.
Teddy!<eos> Teddy!<eos> Python's name is in my... in my laptop.<eos> Teddy?<eos> Darko's laptop was infected with spyware.<eos> Someone was monitoring him.<eos> Python, that's how he knew where the meeting was being held.<eos> I mean, look at his coding.<eos> I mean, there's no pattern to the functions.<eos> It's pure poetry.
There all shelf babies.<eos> Python's army of shelf babies.<eos> These documents are flawless.<eos> This guy's a master forger.<eos> All right, all right, so everybody who bought the sniper rifle, they're a dead end.<eos> Did we have any luck tracking the source of the weapon's remote commands?<eos> It received commands through the Deep Web.<eos> Again, untraceable.<eos> I can see why this guy's not in custody.<eos> Every bit of evidence, whether it's physical or digital, runs right into a wall.
It's not that hard.<eos> Look, I might be smaller, but I fight dirty.<eos> Now drop the attitude, before I take this laptop and break it over that watermelon you call a head.<eos> Break this laptop.<eos> Yeah, that's what I said.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You're a genius.<eos> You shut...<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Python's name isn't in the laptop, it's... it's in the laptop.
You savor this victory.<eos> It'll be your last.<eos> I'll have the site back up tomorrow.<eos> You crossed a line.<eos> You've made this personal.<eos> This is war.<eos> He just said he would get the site back up by tomorrow as if us taking it down was a foregone conclusion.<eos> That makes no sense.<eos> We don't know where he hosts the Web site,<eos> Squamata-- it could be anywhere in the world.

Python's deleting evidence that connects him to the Deep Web.<eos> How do you stop it?<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> You do the one thing you're never supposed to do to a computer that's being used in a crime.<eos> You unplug it.<eos> Oh, no, please, thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Hey, you be careful with that, okay?<eos> It's only the most important piece of hardware
(chuckling)<eos> Guys, hello?<eos> What is it?<eos> Um...<eos> Raven, uh, I think the device you're looking for is probably in the bedroom.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> Hey, yo, you should look in her nightstand drawer, all the way in the back.<eos> Just look all the way in the back. (laughs)<eos> (electronic buzzing) RAVEN:<eos> It's a sex toy.

(laughs)<eos> (electronic buzzing) RAVEN:<eos> It's a sex toy.<eos> MUNDO:<eos> It's a sex toy in a Faraday bag.
This is cyber rape... that escalated.<eos> At first, this digital three-way aroused our third party, but eventually, his appetite for contact would have increased until only real-world contact would have satisfied him.<eos> Isabel's rapist might also be her killer.<eos> RUSSELL:<eos> Hey, guys?<eos> Trace that third device.<eos> RUSSELL:<eos> Change of subject here, but... the blood in our killer's mouth...<eos> MUNDO:<eos> It's arterial spray from our victim.
RUSSELL:<eos> Change of subject here, but... the blood in our killer's mouth...<eos> MUNDO:<eos> It's arterial spray from our victim.<eos> You could tell by the directionality of the blood on his mask.<eos> Right, right, but nobody likes that much blood in their mouth.<eos> No, you're right-- he would have spit it out.<eos> So somewhere at our crime scene, our killer left his DNA.<eos> Raven, looks like you're on loogie duty. ♪ ♪ There it is.<eos> Guy at the store said our victim's sex toy of choice is dishwasher-safe, it syncs with any music library, and has a "solo session" mode.
Only because I am.<eos> Yesterday, we infected ourselves with the target's malware, which means our video chats pass through his computer.<eos> We can communicate with the computer we can't find.<eos> So even though<eos> I can't locate his computer, we can still send his computer an executable.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> A Wi-Fi sniffing program hidden in a video chat.<eos> Hey, Krumitz, you there?<eos> KRUMITZ:<eos> It'll sniff out and locate all the other Wi-Fi signals in the area that aren't hidden.
That's why I didn't read that Tristan was lying.<eos> Tristan so fully believes his delusion that he thinks he's telling the truth.<eos> Tristan thinks this collection of random strangers are his loved ones?<eos> To him, they aren't random strangers.<eos> They are his family.<eos> (phone buzzes)<eos> Russell.<eos> Okay, Avery,<eos> I just got the DNA results back from Tristan's toothbrush.<eos> It's not a match to the saliva samples we got from the crime scene.
Okay, okay, okay, well... (phone buzzing) Wait a minute.<eos> RUSSELL:<eos> Here we go.<eos> All right, so, social media sites like FriendAgenda-- they-they link profiles of relatives like a family tree, right?<eos> KRUMITZ:<eos> Uh, yes, yeah.<eos> Stay-stay with me.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Okay, when I analyzed the saliva samples that Raven collected from the scene, the DNA gave me, what?<eos> Age, hair color, eye color, all of that stuff, but it also gave me evidence of an inheritable genetic disease.
You didn't turn on the oven.<eos> Tell me if this needs more sugar.<eos> I don't... [Gurgles]<eos> Still too sour?<eos> Why would anybody make a sauce out of these devil berries?<eos> Wait.<eos> Did you say the turkey is raw?<eos> Yes, that's right.<eos> You turned on the oven light, not the actual oven.<eos> It's on now, so in about six hours we'll be ready to eat, which would be around midnight.
- At least.<eos> I'll put a rush on this at the lab.<eos> Meanwhile, we need to figure out which iconic cruise ship our Jane Doe was on, because that's our crime scene.<eos> I just got off the phone with Iconic Cruise Lines.<eos> Our victim is Lara Madden.<eos> She was a dancer in their show called "Speakeasy."<eos> Apparently she performed in it last night.<eos> Okay, well, that explains the flapper dress.<eos> And the boat she worked on is an old "Titanic"-era-themed oceanliner named the RMS Bently.<eos> It put into port at Manhattan cruise terminal at dawn.
Good thing Castle's nowhere near this one.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm the king of the world!<eos> Hello?<eos> Beckett?<eos> This can't be happening.<eos> How did you get on board?<eos> You know, we always talked about buying a boat.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I mean, I know it's a fixer-upper.
Because if she finds out that you are spying, you may just have crossed a line you cannot uncross.<eos> She may just get herself killed.<eos> She's left me no other choice.<eos> There's always another choice.<eos> So, what's it gonna be, Rick?<eos> I have to know.<eos> No matter the consequence.<eos> Do it.<eos> Hey, you know that burner cell that Acosta called the night of the murder?<eos> It just pinged off a cell tower at 125th and Lex in east Harlem.
She gave up the phone, she gave up that he called.<eos> Danny, she was drunk.<eos> Who cares?<eos> A defense attorney, when you're on the stand testifying about how you got Wilder's information.<eos> She's not even gonna remember.<eos> We got something.<eos> What?<eos> The number Wilder called from was a burner cell.<eos> Was it deactivated?<eos> According to TARU, it's still on.
I'm overloaded with all the new people.<eos> What new people?<eos> I've got Demi Lovato to take care of now,<eos> And Lena Dunham just put a picture of her asshole On Twitter and wants only the positive comments.<eos> Dude [bleep] Demi Lovato.<eos> She's [bleep] hot.<eos> She's not being fat shamed.<eos> Am so!<eos> But I don't care.<eos> People just have to accept my body the way it is.
You think that's the first Netflix quit I've seen?<eos> Had a busboy do the entire Peter Finch speech from Network.<eos> Shouted out of a window and everything.<eos> Oh, it was Javier.<eos> Welcome back, Greg.<eos> "I'm mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore!"<eos> Oh, it was great.<eos> You should have been there.<eos> Ah, they all come back.<eos> Greg, you want your job back, it's yours.
- Hey.<eos> I just want to apologize.<eos> The whole baby thing...<eos> I didn't exactly...<eos> Sorry, the point is, it's done.<eos> What happened?<eos> The dad showed up out of nowhere, so...<eos> - Glad to hear it.<eos> - And the baby has a name now too.<eos> It's Alex.
VEGA:<eos> Yeah, it's hard to believe this stuff used to come from living cows, right?<eos> Look at this gear.<eos> DNA sequencer.<eos> Synthesizer.<eos> We just missed him.<eos> This book...<eos> What?<eos> What is it?<eos> It was in the package that came through the Sprawl last week.
What, what?<eos> What is he talking about?<eos> Your eyes.<eos> Get her to a hospital now.<eos> Get me a secure exit.<eos> Go!<eos> Go!<eos> (door opens)<eos> The doctors are still trying to sequence the contaminant.<eos> Whatever it is, they're saying somehow it modified her DNA in real time.
Chief walt price speaking.<eos> It's detective cavanaugh here.<eos> I'm afraid I've got some bad news.<eos> That evidence I told you about?<eos> The scrapbook?<eos> It's gone missing.<eos> Babineaux must've gotten to it.<eos> Damn it, cavanaugh!<eos> How the hell did you let that happen?<eos> It was in my desk, someone could've...
And for the first time, Ray, you have exceeded my expectations.<eos> I need to find out what she's been saying, and then I'm gonna kill her myself.<eos> Tell all those yahoos to stop shooting at each other and team up and just bring her to me.<eos> I don't care what it costs.<eos> What?<eos> That's all you got?<eos> Unless you got a warrant for that wire, which I know you don't, you got nothing.<eos> All right?<eos> It'll never stick.<eos> Oh, it'll stick.
dammit!<eos> You and I aren't done yet!<eos> What's with this guy?<eos> It's in my mouth! Pft! Pft!<eos> What's that squirming over there?<eos> It's...mosquitoes? !<eos> You over there.<eos> Evacuate now.<eos> That swarm is conscious.<eos> it will immediately attack.
Mom, stay right here, okay?<eos> There. I was right.<eos> There's blood in the pericardium.<eos> I could've relieved it with a needle downstairs.<eos> You did not need to open him up.<eos> Well, I did, because we're not in a tent in a war zone.<eos> Meredith...<eos> Hunt, is there a problem?<eos> Grey, the patient on your table is my mother's boyfriend.<eos> How's it look?
And just when you think you've extinguished the blaze... (Police radio chatter)<eos> MAN:<eos> All right, we'll load it up.<eos> - Bailey's looking for you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> (Ambulance doors close, engine turns over)<eos> You have to pull it together.<eos> - You're getting yourself in trouble.<eos> - I know.<eos> ...it reignites.
Just steer clear of the mold on the walls.<eos> Which has already spread out of the kitchen.<eos> You keep an eye on him.<eos> Let me know if anything changes.<eos> Uh, a little help in here!<eos> Hello?<eos> !<eos> Okay, this will help us track the fungi's progression.<eos> Right now, it's here;<eos> left unchecked, it'll cross this line in an hour, this line in two.

Uh, then we have a serious problem, because they're spraying the infectious disease ward with a fungicide right now.<eos> Doctor, that is not a Stachybotrys fungus, it is Meliola.<eos> WALTER:<eos> How are you getting on this P.A.?<eos> This is a fungus unlike anything that you've seen before.<eos> It is far more resilient, and the fungicide will not kill it.<eos> Call security.<eos> Exactly where are you, sir?<eos> The Meliola will view the fungicide as a hostile attack.<eos> It will turn its energy to reproduction.
(woman groans)<eos> I know.<eos> Just relax.<eos> I'm a Harvard-trained physician.<eos> MAN: What field?<eos> You don't look like you've done this before.<eos> Psychiatry.<eos> Okay, concept was to heat the standpipe red hot using the gas line from the kitchen.<eos> Yes.<eos> Enough heat, and then when the mixture is poured in, it will vaporize and then distribute throughout the hospital.
That's one opinion.<eos> No, it's actually one, two opinions.<eos> Okay?<eos> Should we keep asking people?<eos> No, no.<eos> Why don't you shut up, Uh-huh.<eos> we'll let him speak, how about that?<eos> You should get your money back from that therapist.<eos> Our vic's name is Ben Nakano.<eos> It's Luke's brother.
So someone smashed him in the back of the head with a bottle.<eos> ABBY: Bright orange-- that's a pretty distinctive color.<eos> It is.<eos> I rushed the samples to the lab, and they were able to detect trace elements on the shards that made up of ingredients to the Pala'ai Ale, a local and seasonal pumpkin microbrew.<eos> Its unique selling point is the bright orange bottle.<eos> Crime lab says it's not sold in stores at this time, however there was a limited distribution to a few taverns.<eos> One is right here in this town.<eos> A place called The Coral Point.<eos> I know that place.<eos> It's only a couple blocks from where they found his body.
He's looked completely overmatched since the opening bell.<eos> Haynes backs Nakano up.<eos> Haynes with a devastating right, and it looks like (siren wailing) it may have hurt Nakano.<eos> JERRY:<eos> Okay, I've been in touch with arena security.<eos> Ben's pass was used ten minutes ago to access an employee entrance.<eos> DANNY:<eos> All right, Jerry, do we have a visual on who used it?<eos> Yeah, three male subjects dressed in arena staff uniforms, carrying a large duffle bag.<eos> Looks like it's pretty heavy.
Who would've thought, back in the fourth round, with Luke Nakano down...<eos> Eight!<eos> ...on one knee, seemingly finished?<eos> Nine!<eos> Ten!<eos> (bell clangs) ANNOUNCER:<eos> It's over!<eos> It is over!<eos> (crowd cheering)<eos> The Welterweight Division has a new champion of the world, and it's Luke Nakano!
And remember...<eos> If the safety's on, you're good as gone.<eos> Okay, and next customer, please.<eos> Ah, going for the big one, huh?<eos> You must be feeling extra jumpy!<eos> You don't know the half of it.<eos> Well, this thing should make you feel more at ease.<eos> You know, you ought to check out the gun show.<eos> The gun show?<eos> Yeah, it's gonna have everything, and with guns being so popular, practically everyone in town is gonna be in attendance.
So much for Intel sharing.<eos> How can I help?<eos> Well, we need eyes on the ground.<eos> Do-do you still have contacts from when you worked in Dubai?<eos> A few, yeah.<eos> I'll make some calls.<eos> Wait, Delilah...<eos> Um... I think you were right.<eos> About the couch.<eos> It doesn't fit the space.
What does NCIS have on me?<eos> The camera connecting you to Meyers.<eos> It's circumstantial.<eos> Yes, but... shooting Meyers really mucked things up.<eos> You need to get ahead of NCIS before they find something.<eos> They won't.<eos> I made sure no one saw me at the park.<eos> No witnesses, no evidence.<eos> What about the rifle?<eos> It needs to be destroyed.
Only thing taken.<eos> All other organs are accounted for.<eos> So two hearts.<eos> PinZ0's and Walton's.<eos> The first heart was shot, the second removed.<eos> Doesn't make sense.<eos> Which is why I went back and took a closer look at the one you recovered this morning.<eos> I noticed the pulmonary trunk was quite large-- too large, in fact, to be viable for a transplant for PinZ0.<eos> So, I had Sebastian run an expedited DNA test on the heart.<eos> Never guess who it belongs to.
I noticed the pulmonary trunk was quite large-- too large, in fact, to be viable for a transplant for PinZ0.<eos> So, I had Sebastian run an expedited DNA test on the heart.<eos> Never guess who it belongs to.<eos> Our killer swapped the hearts to buy some time, make us think this was about killing PinZ0.<eos> But this wasn't an assassination.<eos> This was a heist.<eos> Which means... PinZ0's heart... is still out there.<eos> PinZ0's heart was removed from the donor's chest at 8:15 a.m.<eos> At 9:10, it was switched with Walton's in the back of the paramedics' van.<eos> Now, assuming the heart's in an HP machine now... we've got about seven hours until it expires, along with the kid's chances.
I been poking around your code.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.<eos> After you hacked my server, Rain Boy, you lost the right to can and can't.<eos> Now, about your algorithm.<eos> If you throw in a set variance key, you might cut your trace time in half.<eos> Believe me I've considered it, but that would take another year or two, which I don't have.<eos> Might not have.<eos> Three months and an HH blood type?<eos> That was the only heart, and even if you recover it, the odds of it still being viable are...
What's wrong?<eos> These apps, they're weak.<eos> No Deep Web browser, no Bluetooth sniffer, no Wi-Fi cracker.<eos> I mean, this phone could belong to anyone except a hacker.<eos> No, no.<eos> Wait... wait, wait.<eos> You notice anything about the calculator?<eos> Well, the file size is much larger than the other apps.<eos> That's a gatekeeper.<eos> If we enter a passcode into the calculator's keypad, it opens up a hidden partition.

What's up?<eos> Yeah, man, um... we need to know how to crack into a hacker's passcode.<eos> I got the IMEI number off Quinn's phone from Krumitz.<eos> It's registered to a Lexie James.<eos> An alias?<eos> Yeah. Apparently, Lexie or Quinn was married to a Louis James about nine months ago.<eos> Metro PD is making the notification right now.<eos> The DOJ came through.<eos> So I'm downloading Quinn Elliot's Isla log from the phone manufacturer.<eos> It's an audio file.
"Drowning.<eos> Yielding.<eos> Grasping.<eos> Scarring.<eos> I gave in.<eos> I won't give up."<eos> Looks like an Instagram post.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Hold on.<eos> It's from this Web site.
I won't give up."<eos> Looks like an Instagram post.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Hold on.<eos> It's from this Web site.<eos> "Miafina"?<eos> Means "secret" in Malagasy.<eos> This site is where users anonymously post their deepest, darkest secrets.<eos> Anyone can read them.<eos> It's addictive.
Stay.<eos> Everybody else, get out.<eos> Stand up.<eos> Hands out to your sides.<eos> In case you've forgotten, Officer, you're not allowed to look at our phones.<eos> It's "Agent," and you're under arrest for the aggravated sexual abuse of Shelby Lockhart.<eos> With all due respect, Agent, we're the Paxton crew team.<eos> We don't have to rape anyone.<eos> Rape isn't about sex.<eos> It's about power.
You'll really help me?<eos> Dude, if anyone can find that ring, it's this guy.<eos> As I was in search of my ring, my mom was hunting down her razor candy.<eos> I'm home!<eos> Come quick, I need your help.<eos> Holy crap!<eos> Did you take all that from the tiny hands of little children?<eos> And this.<eos> Bevy, the razor's not in there.<eos> But it might be in here.
You put together this stupid thing for me?<eos> Yeah, you know, I'm not one for sentimental crap.<eos> God! Son of a bitch!<eos> Just take it off.<eos> I can't!<eos> This is a child's helmet.<eos> It's like sucking on my head.<eos> My head's in a vacuum.<eos> Why would you just jam it on?<eos> The more you pull it off, the more it clamps!
I can't blame them.<eos> I hardly seem to be mourning my husband, their king.<eos> You loved Francis.<eos> I've known you for days, and nothing is clearer.<eos> But Scotland can't wait for you to mourn.<eos> It needs the help of a country like mine.<eos> Especially now, after France is withdrawing her troops.<eos> Mary, you're simply doing your duty as queen.<eos> You have made my duty far more pleasant<eos> - than it could have been.
Perhaps Queen Elizabeth would like to keep me from marrying Spain?<eos> Maybe I'm saving your life and I don't want to waste the effort.<eos> My silence would be as wrong as leaving you helpless back there in the woods.<eos> Oh, very well.<eos> I'll bite.<eos> What is this terrible rumor?<eos> Our spies only know that it's something... sexual.<eos> Some object the prince showed to Anna which she found abhorrent.<eos> - Something that's traveled to France with him, no doubt.<eos> If Don Carlos' secret scared Anna, it should scare you, too.
*Better check that wakka wakka wakka wakka*<eos> *Generator*<eos> *Friggin' gas gauge broke*<eos> *The gas gauge bro-oke*<eos> *It says half full*<eos> *But the sucker's on empty*<eos> *Gonna pour this ga-a-a-a-as*<eos> What?<eos> *Gas looks weird*<eos> *It's friggin' super clumpy*
Can you tell me where you were last night at midnight?<eos> The Public Library.<eos> My whole softball team was with me.<eos> You and the boys were hosting a discussion of the latest Danielle Steele novel.<eos> It's a tavern on Fourth.<eos> Okay, that's easier to imagine.<eos> I'm going to need a list of teammates.<eos> - The choking incident.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> It wasn't over playing time.
Me, too.<eos> (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)<eos> (DOOR CREAKING)<eos> What the hell, Lilywhite?<eos> It's 7:45 p.m. Are you 90?<eos> - Rough day is all.<eos> I'm going to remind you of something, son, something you already know.<eos> The world ain't all Dilly Bars and debutante balls.<eos> The world throws wicked punches.<eos> It wants to see who goes down easy.
After all these years?<eos> You've always refused before.<eos> Well, back then, I was worried that seeing you cry over fictional sports would adversely affect my sexual desire for you.<eos> But that's not an issue anymore, friend.<eos> (HONKING)<eos> - Your tire's on my lawn, man.<eos> - Bill me.<eos> What're you doing here?<eos> I know my alibi checked out.<eos> - Yeah, it did.
- Belly's full of fluid. - Matt? Matt?<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Gabi, I'm not seeing an IUP.<eos> Damn.<eos> It's abdominal.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - The fetus is implanted outside of her uterus, somewhere in her abdomen.<eos> - Somewhere?<eos> - I won't know where until I go in.<eos> The placenta leeches off the blood supply of whatever it attaches to and when it tears, so does that site.
All units call.<eos> Downed power lines.<eos> Person trapped.<eos> 3300 West Carpenter.<eos> My son, Kevin, he's in there all alone.<eos> - You gotta get him out.<eos> - Tell me what happened.<eos> The bouncy house...<eos> The wind blew it up.<eos> It hit the power lines and came back down.
Oh, hey, you happy now?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry if you're upset about your little pub, but the laws are the laws.<eos> We just care about the neighborhood.<eos> Yeah? Just keep walking.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - Chili. - What?<eos> - Anthony. - Sorry, buddy,<eos> I wish I had a different...<eos> How old is this structure?<eos> Oh, I remember Herrmann saying something about it being around since Prohibition.
- Sure.<eos> - Get out your violin, Dylan.<eos> We're gonna have that recital. Come on.<eos> - The tumor's that bad?<eos> - Yes, but we're gonna get it out.<eos> - And my hearing?<eos> - Let me explain something.<eos> The memory is not just in the head.<eos> We also have what's called kinesthetic memory, the body's memory.<eos> It remembers movement, resistance, and the position of its parts.
Ah. Subjects, prepare to be devolved.<eos> You will not undo my great works.<eos> How 'bout I just undo your ride?<eos> Subject 89p13, I require assistance.<eos> The de-evolution ray is primed, but there is only enough energy for a single shot.<eos> Not if we aim at the sky.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> The Galacian Wall.<eos> The beam will reflect off the inner surface of the energy shield and bathe the entire hemisphere.<eos> But that'll mean it'll hit Ma and Sis.
Right now, millions of people are watching as we stream live around the world.<eos> Oh, this is streaming right now?<eos> Max, this is streaming.<eos> I'm streaming a little in my pants about this check.<eos> Right now, all around the world, people are seeing what morals look like.<eos> These are the girls who are standing up against the deviants, the divorces, the scientists, the hop-hop lovers, and... the doobie smokers.<eos> Whoa. I don't like people or science, either, but ain't nothing wrong with a righteous doob.<eos> We need to show the world that we will not tolerate these deviants and these degenerates any longer!<eos> I don't want to be associated with these people.<eos> The gays will hate us forever, and when I get an interior, I want it decorated.
Some kind of decoding device?<eos> So 47 was circled in the first book.<eos> So there must be a reason why they used two books.<eos> I mean, maybe it's referring to a... a page in the second book?<eos> So... page 47.<eos> (computer beeping)<eos> Here we go.<eos> And the decoding device.<eos> (sighs) Of course.<eos> It's a windowbox overlay.
That could be anyone.<eos> Those kinds of expos attract a lot of high-ranking people.<eos> I'll have my team go through the attendance list.<eos> I'll keep working on the flower codes.<eos> All right, let's move.<eos> (helicopter buzzing)<eos> Patterson, what do you got?<eos> I figured out the target.<eos> So, based on Olivia's key,<eos> I reverse engineered the flower cipher and it's a modified binary code.

Oh, hey there, little Ms. Pocketbook.<eos> Such a lady.<eos> Yup.<eos> Excuse me. Ripped one.<eos> That's what happens when you make me eat vegetables.<eos> Little crop duster.<eos> Okay, I'm calling you right now.<eos> Ha! Look at that.<eos> Your sweet little face pops up.<eos> It'll do it every time I call.
I, myself, can never get enough backslapping, but I'm afraid our time here is limited.<eos> Obviously you're aware of the sniper attacks in Mannahatta Park today.<eos> One of your executives was killed, Ethan Parris.<eos> Uh, it was our understanding that the victims' names weren't being given out yet.<eos> I managed to procure a list from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. We're here because we have reason to believe these shootings were not random, but rather cover for an assassination.<eos> What?<eos> We think Mr. Parris may have been the real target.<eos> He was the most prominent of the victims by far.<eos> I'm sorry, what does that have to do with anything?<eos> If it was an assassination, it would be the kind which would cost upwards of $1 million.
Is that why you comforted Mrs. Bova?<eos> Was I such a terrible father that you can't imagine me being kind to a widow?<eos> I'm only asking because it is treatable.<eos> It's not uncommon in men of your age.<eos> Isn't the more likely explanation that you've never seen me as I am?<eos> Owing to my deficient powers of observation.<eos> You live a life, Sherlock.<eos> If you're not a fool, it changes you.<eos> I don't think that either of us is a fool.<eos> I don't know Gagnier's location, but I do know where the program was uploaded and where it first began transmitting Bova's whereabouts.
That means a huge devaluation of the dollar.<eos> Driving investors to other currencies.<eos> U.S. would have no more credit and be unable to afford imports.<eos> Which leaves us with a high demand for and a low supply of goods like food and gas and other necessities.<eos> Global panic sets in within days.<eos> Our economy reverts to one where food growers barter for services.<eos> I hate computers.<eos> That's why I need you to get into the Fed's server and kill this ransomware.<eos> I'm already in and it's-it's not happening.<eos> Every time I try and break the code, it changes.

Campus security's offices are also in the basement, which means anyone from any one of those groups could've uploaded the ransomware.<eos> I bet Walt and I could design a DFS that could sniff out the device used to send it.<eos> It's a digital fingerprint scanner.<eos> Each brand of electronics emits its own unique electromagnetic field.<eos> I can tell from the upload pattern that a Toshoki-brand device was used.<eos> Okay, so we build the DFSes.<eos> You give them to Homeland agents, who go undercover on campus.<eos> And they will get a ping when they get close to someone with a Toshoki product.<eos> And then we detain just that person and then confiscate that device.<eos> And if it's the device we're looking for, it'll have the original ransomware code on it.
You missed her birthday 'cause you were at the track.<eos> You blew through both your savings.<eos> You're an egomaniac and a narcissist.<eos> And after all these years, the only person you blame is me.<eos> Keep your mouth shut about all this.<eos> The quantum computer.<eos> It's like meeting Elvis.<eos> If that's what sent the ransomware, let's just smash it and end this.<eos> No, if we do, the ransomware will stay embedded in the Fed's server.<eos> It'll keep running, and before we know it, our economy collapses.
I wanted to put certain safeguards in place before I go.<eos> (sighs)<eos> The CIA took you without my permission.<eos> Now, that is something that can never happen again.<eos> If the meetings in D.C. go as I expect them to, you'll have nothing to worry about.<eos> If they don't,<eos> I can no longer guarantee your safety at the CJC.<eos> You have to come here immediately, yeah?<eos> Now, Rebecca knows that this place is a fortress.<eos> It has the latest in biometric securities.

I would like them suspended pending review.<eos> And I expect a copy of the signed memo authorizing Brian's involvement.<eos> This memo does not exist.<eos> Not from me or from any of my agents.<eos> I just found out about this yesterday.<eos> If no one is held responsible,<eos> I have no other choice but to resign.<eos> There's no need to bluff, Naz.<eos> But if I do resign, Catherine,<eos> I will have plenty of time to expose the fact that the CIA performed a black operation on American soil, and that memo that you say does not exist, it will show up at the DOJ audit.
The investigation is classified.<eos> Well, we'll just be in touch with her lawyer, then.<eos> SAC Pouran is being held under the National Defense Authorization Act.<eos> She has no access to an attorney at this time.<eos> I'll be leading a review of operations here while that's underway.<eos> I know that sounds ominous, but I'm here to help.<eos> BRIAN:<eos> Assistant Director in Charge Grady Johnson.<eos> Let's start with the obvious, shall we?<eos> He's actually five-foot-four without the platform shoes, he smiles with his face but not with his eyes, upgrades to the latest phone the second it comes out, your basic hatchet man, here to do someone else's dirty work.
She does keep a lot of secrets.<eos> She just went down to D.C. to save your ass.<eos> She got thrown into a hole for it.<eos> She is being framed.<eos> And we are gonna help her.<eos> Hey, all right.<eos> Oh, uh, will you do me a favor?<eos> Can you water my bonsai plant?<eos> It's on the table.<eos> It's special to me.
REBECCA:<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You're not really gonna try to bring your music collection in the largest format possible, are you?<eos> (phone rings)<eos> Oh, that's Johnson's phone.<eos> It's from Deputy Director Rovick.<eos> They said that they looked through Naz's phone.<eos> And Naz texted someone just before she was arrested.<eos> But they can't trace the number;<eos> it was a burner phone.
Joint operation with Counterintelligence but make sure it's clear that the CJC has point, yeah?<eos> Any questions?<eos> - Just wondering where we stood vis-à-vis the headquarters negotiations?<eos> You realize you're being ridiculous?<eos> Of course.<eos> Then why do you keep repeating the word "headquarters?"<eos> Because.<eos> Every day I come in here and this place tries to make me a little bit more like it.<eos> I've done a lot now.<eos> It can be more like me.
And how I got you out and stuff?<eos> If you would like an office as a reward for good work, we can discuss...<eos> No. Naz!<eos> Boring stuff happens in an office.<eos> Cool stuff happens in a headquarters.<eos> Oh.<eos> __<eos> Can I call it an office and you call it a headquarters?<eos> Yeah, Naz, you can call it whatever you want in the privacy of your own thoughts.<eos> But it has to say "Headquarters!" on the door,

Look, Lawrence is thrilled that somebody believes he's innocent.<eos> And, all right, if he runs...<eos> He's not gonna run, he's innocent.<eos> You think.<eos> Even if he didn't kill his wife, it's still a crime to escape from prison.<eos> Listen, the guy got a raw deal, okay?<eos> Lawrence is only on the top ten list in the first place because he broke out of jail with Lonnie Hyde.<eos> Right, Hyde is a five-time killer.<eos> But Lawrence had to use Hyde's cell to build the tunnel.<eos> It's the only place he could dig out.

Saturday is her birthday.<eos> What are you gonna get her?<eos> Ladies love haikus.<eos> Clever crafted word parties.<eos> Ladies love haikus.<eos> Nah, son. I'm trying to impress my woman, not depress my woman.<eos> Why don't you get her a tube top from the Delia's catalogue?<eos> I've got something even classier in mind.<eos> Nice.<eos> Does it open, and can you put a little picture inside?
No, nothing.<eos> Well, they didn't just swim back to Oahu.<eos> STEVE:<eos> So we gotta move.<eos> Back to the plane.<eos> There could be a weapon there or a radio or at least something that tells us who these people are and gives us an advantage.<eos> Okay?<eos> You want to go back to the plane?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's the last place these guys are gonna look.
Thanks, kid.<eos> - You wanna tell me what you're doing<eos> - Oh, cool bike.<eos> here alone from Phoenix?<eos> Mom went psycho.<eos> And I-I can't deal 'cause she's such a hypocrite, okay?<eos> She... she has three tattoos that I know of.<eos> And she goes nuclear when I get one little one?<eos> So you got a tattoo?<eos> It means... - freedom and safe travels. - Mm.
Don't you remember?<eos> Yeah. Sisters are complicated.<eos> Yeah, well... maybe everything would've been less complicated if Ginny was my mom.<eos> I-I shouldn't have said that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Dani, your mother loves you.<eos> And yes, she can be... she can be a lot of work sometimes.<eos> And I'm sure she's overreacting about the tattoo, but she is trying.<eos> You know, this doesn't just represent freedom.<eos> It also means loyalty to family.

That was for Hector.<eos> That bastard framed him.<eos> Ieso!<eos> Esta es mijo.<eos> You got two minutes to be gone.<eos> And take the trash out with you.<eos> You were right. It was all too perfect.<eos> They want me on a different project.<eos> In Singapore.<eos> It's actually a promotion.
I hate guys like that.<eos> Just 'cause he has a hot girlfriend, he thinks everyone wants to bone him.<eos> Mr. Jaffee, we've almost got the all-clear.<eos> We just need to take you upstairs for a pre-op chest X-ray and an EKG, and then we're good to go.<eos> So, you're gonna need to lose the hat.<eos> He, uh, won't take it off.<eos> I tried.<eos> Look, my late wife gave me this hat.<eos> You know, I caught 22 prize-winning bluegills in it!<eos> It goes everywhere I go.
You two aren't seeing the B-I-G picture here.<eos> A lemur-ized foosa could return to her peoples and tell them how fun and awesome we are and to stop eating us.<eos> Think of it. Peace in our time zone.<eos> Wow. That actually is a good idea.<eos> Let the lemur-izing begin!<eos> - [foosa roars]<eos> I will now lemur-ize this foosa through the magic of science.<eos> Timo, thank you for volunteering.<eos> Actually, I-- I believe I tried running away.<eos> The unknown is always frightening, especially when it will most likely eat you.
Oh. I'd like to field some questions right now as to how to judge if King Julien is a good king or not.<eos> Okay! Thank you!<eos> Thank you, Mary Ann.<eos> What? Mary Ann, sweetheart, you know you're my favorite foosa.<eos> But maybe, just maybe, before you start teaching the huddled masses about killing kings and stuff, you could, uh, run it by me first.<eos> Someone has to stop this.<eos> King Julien, are you awake yet?<eos> Hmm. Hmm. [mumbles] Maurice, stop snoring.<eos> King Julien?<eos> Because, Madam, my tushy has a mind of its own and it will kiss whomever it likes!
